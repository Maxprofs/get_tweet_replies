@BarackObama  Sounds just like a politician talking here to me.
@BarackObama the labor movement doesn't believe you anymore.   Selling out workers isn't leading on trade
@BarackObama Probably the stupidest decision Obama every made was try to use the debt ceiling to force all sides to adopt his grand bargain.
@BarackObama How about the forced labor in Malaysia? It seems as if you're giving a pass to their slave system. Shameful. #TTP
@BarackObama You're a smart man, you know what happened with nafta. The TPP will send more good paying jobs overseas. #NoFastTrack!
@BarackObama Bravo si fa cosi
@BarackObama @Flwrgirl66x Then you can't sign the TPP :/ Look at NAFTA etc! Lost Jobs! Have you personally read it? Let us read it! #StopTPP
@BarackObama
@BarackObama then why are you constantly trying to raise taxes on us so your wife who does nothing can have a high end salary on top of urs
@BarackObama But you WOULD sign a deal that undermines global nuclear security! If you want to #LeadOnTrade, empower small business!
@animalArnie @BarackObama
@HerbertjeJames Are u insinuating I am a racist for finding @BarackObama a weak leader? Do u even see what is going on in the world?

@animalArnie @BarackObama @theonlyadult 

#Fix #nafta by:
forcing corps outsourcing pay worker 30k not close & starve exploded workers
@BarackObama that's so broad it's meaningless and no president has done half as much to kill the middle class and your not done
@BarackObama no or anything that's good for america like the pipe line or oil exploration
@barackobama
.@BarackObama Just once, please say it'll help working AMERICAN families, and I don't mean starting ten years from now.
@BarackObama so no on the tpp?
@BarackObama what an egotistic peace of crap.
@BarackObama ?? valla sen adam değilmişsin onu anladım
@BarackObama #TPP, yeah right!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama lies lies lies! #ttip #tpp #fascist #obama
@BarackObama If you won't sign a trade deal that harms US workers, then you should not allow #TPP!
@BarackObama somehow i doubt that. Not a fan 4 your secret agreement at all.
@BarackObama 
You already have, lost more jobs during your tenure than Hoover did!

@BarackObama @Valerie0714 HOW DARE YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE WORLD AND TELL BALD FACED LIES! YOUR SQUANDERED PRESIDENCY WILL BE YOUR LEGACY!
@BarackObama @Valerie0714 WE'RE NOT STUPID MR OBAMA & IT'S INSULTING WHEN YOU INSINUATE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TPP IS! YOU'RE A LIAR!
@BarackObama @Valerie0714 LIAR! STOP TALKING TO PPL LIKE WE'RE STUPID! 

YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR & A TRAITOR!
@BarackObama than dont sign it. We already know whats going to happen.  http://www.manufacturingnews.com/news/10/0615/WTO.html …
@BarackObama You means, "As long as it doesn't undercut your families benefits. I notice you don't apply the same of anything to yourself
@BarackObama Obamacare undercut working families and U still signed it that is easy to say when we are face to face
@BarackObama Deja Vu. You sound just like Bill Clinton did on NAFTA.
@BarackObama "NAFTA means jobs. Good-paying American jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement." - Bill Clinton
@BarackObama "NAFTA means jobs. Good-paying American jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement." - Bill Clinton
@BarackObama
@BarackObama there isn't a way to foresee that it happens as a by product
@BarackObama I'd trust if I could verify. Continuing #TPP secrecy destroys any trust I might have extended your Administration on trade.
@BarackObama 85% of negotiators were corporate lobbyists? No one could read or speak of terms til #FastTrack is in place? Thx 4 ur "trust".
@BarackObama I trust you, thanks
@BarackObama How do you look in the mirror after lying to the country about how great Nike is? You get on your jet and visit the factories!
@BarackObama Nike is using workers as servants, low pay, hazardous working conditions and you stand and lie to the american public! Shame!
@BarackObama What about the families in Nike sweatshops? The agreement will not change Nike practices and they are 1 bad company.

@BarackObama sono pienamente d'accordo con te grande presidente
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Bill Clinton said the same thing w/The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Open it to the public. Lets see what's in?
@BarackObama Perfecto :)

@BarackObama 尊敬的总统阁下，您会帮助受到苦难的人们吗？

Trying to beat Russia - China alliance? Stop USA Co from sending jobs there.
@BarackObama great
@BarackObama you apparently didn't look at Obamacare!
@BarackObama this is going to open up even more offshore hiring and the loss of net neutrality. I'm not sure how that helps working fams...
“@BarackObama: "If any agreement undercuts working families—I wouldn’t sign it." —President Obama #LeadOnTrade” #NoFastTrack
@BarackObama @edshow We did not doubt the president good intention for working families; We reject Corporate Democrats @GOP @Lukewarm Media

@BarackObama Good speech Mr. President. Thanks for bringing the sunshine to Portland!
@BarackObama Your speaking prowess has made me rethink my view on the upcoming trade agreements.
@barackobama very right
@BarackObama Please publicly answer the concerns of Elizabeth Warren so that we can close this issue-huge fan of yours & Elizabeth
@BarackObama except for obamacare?
@BarackObama I have a problem with trade agreements that heavily favor the other side. Another problem is loopholes that get around them.
@BarackObama NO ILLEGALS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BarackObama consumers before corporations, please, plees, thank you.
@BarackObama even if by not signing you would further expand #Poison4Profit N2 the American People's Food Chain?

@BarackObama Define the consequences instead if using an inadequate word as 'undercut'. What ways might #tpp undercut working poor?
@BarackObama then why do you sign tax increases and regulation agreements that are burying the middle class.
@BarackObama follow me
@BarackObama The best.

@BarackObama  "Free" trade allows corporations to offshore high paying jobs for working families, hide revenue, and shift tax burden #NoTPP
