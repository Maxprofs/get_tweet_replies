THANK YOU!!! She is the WORST choice for our schools! Unqualified, Unethical, Misinformed. PLEASE VOTE NO on DeVos
Thank you for opposing Betsy DeVos! #votenodevos
THANK YOU! Please help convince your (R) colleagues that she is as awful as her hearing performance!
@Honey17011
tell all the democrats &republicans to vote no on sec. of education. Vouchers won't work for the poor people.
Hope your "no" is b/c DeVos has no experience in education-never with students/admin, and not b/c Trump nominated her.
Thank you and please convince your fellow Senators to do the same! #noDevos #DeVosvote
@LiberalsAreCool Quite obviously the only sensible vote here is no. Thanks senator! Get more Rs to make the right choice.
@@MartinHeinrich is with you on this, I know he was with sessions @WickedMadLib @SenatorTomUdall @LiberalsAreCool
thank you.from Michigan
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you for promising to vote no. Your opposition is greatly appreciated.
@SenateDems Of course you are. Was there ever a doubt? Partisan hack.
@SenateDems can't DEMS just do a brexit like REP did to Obama a few times when they shut down the hill to block "Obamacare"
Thank you!!
not to mention she couldn't pass a basic test about education facts.
@SenateDems looks like you're against giving all children freedom of choice in education. Pretty hypocritical.
THANK YOU SENATOR!
@CharlesGoodmach you go Tom! Thank you.
@cottadrums And Bannon lacks the sanity for his post.
dude, Bannon lacks sanity for life in the 21st Century.
thank you for opposing DeVos. Naming her as appointee was offensive, giving her control of Ed would be disaster.
Thank you from this 30+ year public school teacher
thank you!
Thank you! Good to have a senator with ethics and a spine.

If you don't teach in a public school, you have no idea to what is going on in our schools...
