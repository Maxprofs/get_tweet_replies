.@SenSchumer For many families, PERIOD!. This bill is the gutting of America's responsibility to its poor. and BIG tax cut for rich. #ACA
what tax cuts?
you are in favor of taking money out of Medicare and giving it to wealthy people? Ok.
but Medicare is!  Original bill $160 billion out of Medicare. Now still $110 billion. All for rich ppl!
ok win for Dems...so  Dems what are YOUR FIXES FOR ACA?
what about the working stiffs?  My premiums up 35% for less benefits. Let me have your insurance
Trouble is that @realDonaldTrump and his toadies dont give a good goddamn
I didn't know health care was based on race! Your got to be kidding! Why the separation?
why do you mislead so much?  It's appalling.  #BullSchumer
Seriously? Have you seen what O-care has done? Stop trying to sway latinos. Everyone sees that you are full of crap!
It's a win, but let's not be naïve to thank that the Republicans will do any thing but work against O-care. Leave it Trumpcare
if Obamacare is so great, why don't you use it?
REALLY? You are worried about one sector? $500 monthly premiums with $8000 yearly deductible for Caucasian? You're ok with that?
you are done you are going back to kings way
well that's what ACA did for me and you didn't give a shit. You touted how great it was. Except for those who had care and job
Your a Traitor, did Bill Clinton mind that you had a fling with Hillary
Raise premiums? Oh you mean for those with Free Insurance? I pay $1300 a month with a $12700 deductible @Therealbp65
what about the 18k a year mine cost plus the high deductible of 6k? That's what y'all give me with Obama Care
Thanks for your tenacious commitment!
what's so sad is that you're willing to sit there and do nothing.
not anymore it won't! ACHA is down the toilet where it belongs! Thanks for all your hard work!
nothing like pulling the race card Chuck.
It is all on you in Democratic party you own OCare...you know best Senator.
You are wrong and lying as usual. I can't wait til the truth comes out about you. You do not represent the citizens of the USA esp mid class
healthcare is "human right" no matter who is US Pres incharged. We are open society & healthcare must be open to all ppl...
Move to Russia and stand in line for a doctor.
just like Obamacare. Let it fail.
ok Mr Schumer I'll bite. Do you really think Americans give a shit about all the Latinos????
LATINOS YOUR PRIORITY?  YOU ARE A LEADER?  Really
these were the arguments from 8 years ago.
How can Trump raise premiums under Obamacare. Did you set premiums last years. Think you are lying now
Obamacare will explode this year and people will DIE
Anything THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STAES does,you Dems complain.
Many of my Dem friends are saying they will never vote Dem again.
what about AZ?  116% ^^
OK, you got your greedy way.   I hope you don't eat it before the end of the year.
hmmm, sounds like what Obama Care is right now.

I'd say the fact that the @dccc isn't running ads today in R House districts taking credit for saving people's healthcare shows why Ds lose.
@realDonaldTrump US Americans are tired of being pushed to the back seat. Autistic kids go without. Get your affairs in order
Victory! The ACA lives! Thank you senator! Thank you Dems!
Doesn't care about Americans. Explain to a 5 yr old Autistic boy why they keep cutting his medical. You can't
so glad the GOP didn't pass the bill! Now it's you & the Democrats disaster!
Well now you own it. Obamacare still here. When it implodes it's all on the Democrats. Ha. I think you're really the big loser.
Uhh doofus, Obamacare is on a death spiral. You think Obamacare is bringing costs down?? You lost in Nov. Gorsuch on way to SC.
It is dead. You happy now?? It failed because Ryan wrote it. We don't like Ryan.
Obamacare has been the biggest disaster in US History! Trump has done more work than all of you incompetent buffoons in the DC
Please work Together with the GOP to fix issues with Obamacare!!! Thank you.
You own it
Who pays your insurance hypocrite #yourfailingyourparty
and what does Obama care does. Not you'll find out. It's all the DEMOCRATES FAULT NOW!!!!
. YOU AND YOUR PARTY ARE HURTING AMERICA. IT IS POLITICS ONLY WITH YOU PEOPLE. DEPLORABLE.
Why must everything be about your ideology instead of working on behalf of ALL people. Why is it your way or no way schumer?
lol nice reach out to latinos Chuck... ring the bell!
what the hell do you think we have had the last 7 years. You should be proud of the pain u put on Americans
@realDonaldTrump  Ricind Senate and Congress executive order and make them all use Obamacare until it implodes like we have to.
Looks like Trumpcare is dead. Now is the time for Democrates to unite and fix Obamacare for the good of the country and party
From my post in Spanish: you speaking Spanish goes together like cookies and ass.
Anything is better than the ACA.
that's is OBAMA care the only one like that unpaid for hard WORKING class that you talking rigth the fail program
Obama care has raised premiums. Not worried about the Whites, blacks, Asians or Muslims Chuck
What a Joke Joker! 
You know all about pockets. You constantly have your hand in other people's pocket. Get off the government Tit. Get a job.
the rich get richer, the poor get poorer....and the republicans will be out in 18....by democracy or force
as an independent one thing we all know is the donkey and the elephant are the parties of deceit
we're not stupid citizens we have a global communication system to communicate thru a variety of means
and Obama care was imploding everyone knows it was designed to fail to force a single payer system
@HouseGOP #KILLTHEBILL #NoTrumpCare
AHCA=DEATH PANEL
Your concern for Latino families is hypocritical.
I will lose my healthcare coverage if this Trumpcare goes through!
oh, no, not the Latinos
I do not believe this. Statement flies in the face of everything this @POTUS is attempting to accomplish. #moredemlies
and other poor people!
sort of like Obamacare has!
don't listen to HATERS Chuck, NON knuckle draggers are behind you 110%!!!
yeah , but the rich will get a tax cut, so all is good!
ACA has already done that. U guys r something, disingenuous and misleading or I should say out right lying.
What will Obamacare do?
And what do you think the unaffordable care act has done? Wow what complete idiots.
STFU schumer.
oh bull. You screwed it up and you own it. We aren't buying your lies.
U read the entire proposal? I doubt it!! U made sure original 'Obama Care' bill passed w/o reading it! That was NO PROBLEM!
wouldn't it be great if everyone sent put English and Spanish tweets every time, we could all double our feed reading
then why are the Premiums for #Obamacare going up 22% next year it's #imploding on itself
everyone should unfollow you until you stop tweeting in Spanish,open another account in Spanish if you want to reach them
you are the biggest Hypocrite on earth!  Ashamed you are member of the Senate and an American.
Ur FACE is out of reach of Latino families!
Trumpcare/Ryancare will also make health insurance too expensive for pre-Medicare retired seniors.
No no no @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal  NO - #exNY'r living in CT #sandyhookmom
Thank you Chuck. Keep standing up for us in NY! We appreciate you and we need you!! ♡
Reminds you of Obama Care huh Chuck.
# love it how much you are doing for POTUS & republican agenda. Right under noses of you own party Keep up good work Chuckles.
Just like obamacare eh chuckie
still saving your party at the expense of Americans. AMERICANS ARE NOT STUPID BE  THE SOLUTION STOP THROWING SAND IN GEARS
# who are you kidding. Be sure as you lean way to left that the majority of voters are going to be with you come election.
@POTUS_45Don @WashintonPost @Politicony
Schumer & his followers are against Making America Great Again. As a result the little
As a result the little guys eat hot dogs and Schumer eats Filet Mignon.
... Where was your concern for Latino families (including White, Black, Asian families) during Obamacare Chuck #FixCountryChuck
doesn't everyone know Schumer is a political actor who doesn't do anything real?  It's true. He only reads from a script.
what about Chinese, Korean, Crackers, blacks?
keep up the fight. Gop are shattering before our eyes
What about AMERICAN families?  We can't afford it either!!  Repeal and replace
I thought that was the plan.
I say.. let's keep O'Care.. you all need to answer for the crap legislation. It's all on you, you'll answer for it in 2018.
wow I feel much better since #Obama promised premiums would go down if #Obamacare became law. How's that working?
Trump Care will cause the collapse of the system. It takes back to bad to suck flooding emergency rooms with uninsured. Very bad
R U not paying attention ER's are overwhelmed right now & yes I work there
out of reach for us all
It would be unaffordable for most families. #KillTheBill
Putting Affordable Healthcare Out of Reach of Most Families
"No matter how unrelated, make it about racism" says Nancy to Chuck.  "Work or press conference?" "Good one, Chucky" (pause) 
what the coverage have to do with race this foes make cents
this legal Latino never received govt assistance & AHA stole my insurance. Enough lies Chuck.
What are your plans to fix healthcare?
: you sir are the perfect example of everything and anything that is wrong with our government.  schumer stinks !
Sounds like a buy. Go long the AHCA.
What Schumer is trying to say is forget about how we took 1000s in disposable income from the middle class with Obamacare
give me a break! Most around here are illegal..they don't pay a dime and spend 100s a week on video poker machines
Trumpcare is not a bill it is a massacre!
All UR worried about is Latino families and/or Latino Illegals too?Americans do not want to pay4 illegal Immigants Medical care!
you & @POTUS44 potus4 forget who screwed up insurance to begin with. Prior to ACA we could afford payment/ deductibles, not noe
ACA raised premiums and deductibles 3x. You lied about that... Makes you a LIAR.  Con man a criminal. Your finished
@whitehouserogue As a retired teacher I have grave concerns about what the cost will be for retirees! #Trumpcaresucks
Because of the Obamacare Exchanges that will remain for awhile. Do you ever tell the truth Chuck?
please stop.  That is all happening now.  The idea was a wonderful one but it was poorly executed.  It needs to be re-done
it should be called ( NoCare Healthcare )
why can't only Latinos afford it Chuck?
Just "any families" would have also worked.
Thanks for watching out for US, Senator, #Trumpcare is cruel to the poor and will hurt the middle class.
Obamacare is already unaffordable!  I'm willing to give Trumpcare a chance!
How about all Americans? sch, sch, sch when will you understand we are all in this together? #MAGA
Illegal Latino families or legal Latino families? Please specify.
why didn't you care when Obama care raise premiums on everybody? You have zero credibility on this, Chuck.
the cost of @LIRR is out of reach for LIers and their service is horrific yet you IGNORE the pleas to investigate
illegals do not rate health care!
Pandering to Latino families??? What about non-Latinos who are under poverty line? Chuck, did you really say that?
latinos? You are the great divider .. keep race out of every topic please .

No one below $20k a year will be able to afford health insurance coverage. Everyone with insurance will pay for ER care.
don't forget this is a tax cut disguised as a healthcare bill.  I don't think they care about the health portion.
you mean many non-citizen families don't you
yes but they will have "access"!!??!!
Out of reach for many working families.  Might be a time to advance & educate about Single payer.
Twitter the horrible trolls and hatred for each other makes Trumpy people happy...#divideandconquer #keeptrying Senator
IGNORAMUS!!  You are only proving that the Damncrats are in fact COMMUNISTS!!  SPREAD THE WEALTH (except yours) of course.
under ACA my premiums went from 450 a month to 1700 so whats difference?
love how u run back to race based statements. Ur standard "argument" when you lack logical argument. People see through it. Sad!
What are you talking about increase?Family of 4 deductible 23k a year,premium $680 mth,ACA only good if u get medicaid,it sucks
Reply to @SenSchumer those older, poor white women who voted for Russia's candidate also will suffer under #Trumpcare.
gee sounds like obamacare  you mean illegal immigrants don't you what the citizens that can't afford premiums/deductibles 
make sure u keep up ur good work of race bating u dividing hate spreading pile of democrat garbage.
Latino families? NOT MY PROBLEM. You just want them to keep voting for the cow so the milk keeps coming. GET A JOB!!!
good
Schumer should be investigated for anti American actions. Schumer needs to answer for his attempt to make our country Communist
Y do you keep playing identity politics? Because you can't win on policy. Stop being a racist and cone up with some decent plans
what about the black families who have been here over 200 years .. Hmmmm .. Do they count
