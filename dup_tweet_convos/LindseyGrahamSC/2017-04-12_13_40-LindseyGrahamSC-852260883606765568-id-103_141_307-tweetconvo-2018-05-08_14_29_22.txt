Lyndsey what did Russia do to "Interfere" with the election? we have not seen any proof or an explaination of what "Interfere" means....
Then you haven't been paying attention
Ok, so tell us, what exactly did Russia do?
Proof please instead of hear say and what the media outlets have fed you. Tell us with proof.
You wouldn't believe the proof if it walked up & kicked you in the ...
In the what? How do you know what I believe, person on Twitter? You assume like most of society.
What you believe you have made more than clear. All mainstream media, except Fox is fake news. You are being told what to think by Trump.
I haven't believed a president since Reagan quite honestly.
OMG @FoxNews why would anyone other then RINO care about what slimebucket soros puppet graham says???
I love it when conservatives attack and insult other conservatives makes my day!
graham's not a conservative he's a RINO soros puppet
preaching war
Like I said nothing makes me happier then watching repubs insulting conservatives and tea baggers voting against a right wing President.
I can't tell if you are friend or foe? republican or democrat? I think i am going to have to block you...
#TrumpRussia #RussiaTrump #PutinTrump #TrumpPutin https://www.operationveracity.com/trump-scam/trumpinc.html …
and who do you think it would have gone to if Hillary were president?
Did you hear about how much putin hated Hillary?
Why would he?  She gave him a large chunk of our uranium and he knows she can be bought. And she's a woman, not a threat in his eyes
Did I miss something?  Where's the proof Russia interfered in our election?
LOL literally every single intelligence agency—including Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee—have confirmed Russian interference
Really? What is the evidence?  All I've heard is so&so says Russia hacked the elections.  Just words, no proven evidence.
How do we know you are not a russian tool for that matter?
Senator, the U.S. has yet to provide definitive proof that Assad used sarin gas on April 7.
Thank you for standing up against Russia.  Now please get this administration gone before he starts a nuclear war!
Lindsey Graham and John McCain will not stop until World War III starts.
Sputnik stated n Korea can launch a sarin gas missile
Hello-earth to Sen Graham. Your president does not sanction Russia, remember? This admin is FUBAR!
Picking too many fights at once isn't smart Senator.
@SenJohnMcCain & @LindseyGrahamSC posture towards Russia that influence #Trump Admin, has now led humanity to the brink! 2 fools playing 
Good! I hope this gets taken up the day Congress reconvenes.
Oh Lightfoot Lindsay cool your jets. You need to go out to the bathhouse and have a good soak with the boys from the hill..
UN   Needs restructuring as to security council and  veto power!
Pipe down Lindsey
Graham  go away I am republican saying this you and McCain are destroying the Republican Party to hard core right wing nuts
Israel Lobby lackey @LindseyGrahamSC still pushing #Syrian regime change for Israel like #Iraq: http://america-hijacked.com/2012/02/12/israel-lobby-pushes-for-us-action-against-the-syrian-government/ … #Syria
The resolution is symbolic only
Was that from Mr or Mrs graham
It's time for US to get out of the UN. The biggest do nothing organization on the planet.
I like you Lindsey but how are you surprised by Russia's veto!
You tell em tough guy!  Maybe you and nutty McCain should invade!
Gongrats. Got it right.  Broken clock is right twice a day
- ask him and John M what the hell they are doing about VA BULL !
Its all STAGED
This just shows how guilty Russia is. They know what is going on.
.it is time to re-instate Russia Sanctions lifted on 2/2/2017 for unknown reasons!
Lavrov to Tillerson: If you have any successful examples of when the U.S. ousted a dictator, please let me know.PLEASE ANSWER IF YOU GOT ONE
The UN has to keep the pressure on as well. Congress should support any and all sanction requests.
That's what America do for Israel at UN. We use our veto to protect Israel. each veto holder has it's own poodle to protect.
.@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Showing that the French rarely think things through by only calling on the Syrians to comply w/ the investigation
.@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC They are first demanding that the Syrians liberate Idlib province from the Army of Conquest.
It legitimizes further attacks against Syria.
Syria and Russia are friends.  Russia and the United States are not now or never will be friends.  Hopefully Trump now understands
I do not believe that any evidence has been provided to American Citizens that Russia did anything in elec.
You really think we should take the word of Clapper (liar)Rogers, and Comey who refused to cooperate
Is that the same @LindseyGrahamSC that is controlled by Bilderberg who wants a WAR with Russia!

Who knew!

cc @POTUS
Correct #Sanctions are necessary. Congress should be supportive. POTUS isn't as convinced as many are of Putin's involvement.
I've known Russia for most of 60 years; they'll come around. They're a little spoiled.
When are senators going to start going with facts instead of personal vendettas. They dont have the people of the USA in mind.

Lindsey I'm tired of this  Bulls S--t Russian crap either proof it or shut up about this liberal lie. I though you had more sense than that.
It would appear that Russia is spoiling for a fight and with Trump they will probably get one serious dust-up.
Jp. I expected this of #assput
Maybe it's time to hold them to account for attacking our country too? Even Tillerson, Trump's , acknowledges it.
Secretary Tillerson on Russia interference in US elections:
It is a serious issue. It is one serious enough to attract additional sanctions. 
Graham is 100% right!!! Kick Putin out of the SWIFT Banking System and see how well the Made in Russia System works.
Will the woman of the Senate please stop...
Haha Lindsey's treasonous butt buddy @SenJohnMcCain organized the chemical false flag attack with his "moderate" ISIS operatives last month.
Good to see Lindsey Graham hasn't lost a single beat since his SCOTUS imposed gender reassignment procedure.
Russia should be voted out of their prestigious status in this organization based on their history & recent association w/ legit war crimes.
1.  Who cares what she says. 2. A vote they have a right to. Punish them? Sounds familiar. 3.  Watch 4 push to disband SC. 2 much veto power
With Hillary giving Russia 20% uranium I think it was a middleman deal to give to Iran for their nuclear project.
@LindseyGrahamSC You forgot in your statement the invasion of @Ukraine and stealing land...#Crimea
#TrumpRussia #RussiaTrump #PutinTrump #TrumpPutin https://www.operationveracity.com/trump-scam/trumpinc.html …
Sorry to beat you all down about this statement, but that is what you get when you give men and governments too much control over humanity.
You should be personally thinking at defcon 3 level.
Lindsey, Lindsey...why would the US do that when the POTUS has Russian ties! #nobrainer #corruption #trumprussia #trumprussiacoverup #wakeup
like twitter trolls, russians just want to see what they can get away with
We're the only Nation to use Nuclear weapons on Civilians, Women and  Children. Russia you will isolate yourselves if you back Assad
Senator how much did that bother you, Senator?
He said as he held a purring Mr Whiskers.
VP Cheney admitting to GOP Fed Chairman Greenspan, Bush INVADED Iraq to STEAL OIL. 1,200,000 DEAD(UK) including 100,000's of children.
Graham is salivating at the thought of more war. He is a psychopath
If you put a wig on him I guess he could technically be a "women of the senate" 
all I read is: “We Want WW3…We Want WW3”
Graham is a walking war mongering wet dream - the guy gets off on death
https://www.operationveracity.com/trump-scam/trumpinc.html …
Lindsey Graham is a hysterical bitch.
Shut up, Lindsey.
