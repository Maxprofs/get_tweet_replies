JUST IN: Donald Trump signs executive order advancing Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines http://washex.am/2jVu55t  
shame on you!!!!
@dcexaminer How do you even sleep at night?
on his bed of DIRTY MONEY
@dcexaminer Wrong
Not if the solar using sand becomes the way of the future and connecting to pipelines foreign owned
lets take a look http://www.scout4apps.com 
I was just starting to warm up to you.  This is a terrible thing.   #WaterIsLife #NoDAPL
Sigh, and I'd just started liking you.
it's all a show to win votes he is happy his pockets and campaign funds will see more money at the expense of us
Well I'm not a fan of his policies, but I still support that he tells the truth about Trump's lies. @LindseyGrahamSC
it's all show he doesn't have a backbone for us doesn't side with US neither does MCCain
really? Bluster, no?
The difficulty is the jobs are temporary, spills are a matter of time, we screw the Indians again, clean water trumps all
See, I think we need more alternative energy jobs to be created.  No spills, no protests?
You all just don't get it do you?  You really, really don't.
This was absolutely NOT a great decision!
great for his pocketbook. Bad for precious water. Bad for Natives' rights. Hope to see you removed soon
Noooooooo...this is a terrible decision! #WaterIsLife #NoDAPL
@dcexaminer Keystone: bad decision for the United States. Foreign oil across USA to offshore buyers.
Why is this a good decision, and for whom? Some facts and details would be helpful.in understanding.
for good measure: oil is meant to stay in the ground. Extraction kills- your support means murderer #NoDAPL #NoKXL
you proved your ignorance. Please step down and let someone in touch with reality take over #wakeup
Native American sacred lands loose to big money. You think they blast through churches as well?
I Totally disagree with you - it would pass over an aquifer. Have you no brains?
Support the pipeline because we own stock in the company?  We need to know!! #conflictofinterest
can't wait until you are replaced. an embarrassment to the uniform.
For who? Disgusting..
No, it's a bad one. We need to move away from big oil. #waterislife #stopdapl #standingrock
: you are a sad excuse for a American! I believe sc has see enough of you though! Lmao!
@dcexaminer sadly misguided, indeed horrifying to see your support
please do not use our time on the hill to advocate for fossil fuels and an unsound commodity.
@dcexaminer oh never mind .
fossil fuels are backward looking and put huge risk on American soil with very little American benefit.
@dcexaminer I can't disagree more! This is terrible, hurts US citizens health & safety in favor of big biz
Terrible decision. The public outcry has shown disapproval. #Midterms 11/6/2018
ADVANCING THE DESTRUCTIION OF WATER FOR MILLIONS, NOT JUST DACOTANS. DON'T DO THIS.
@dcexaminer trump profits personally. Americans lose
WRONG! @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump
@dcexaminer pipeline has nothing 2 do w oil
L Graham ?plan if 50M b of oil dumps in2 Charleston harbor
I wish you were NOT happy about this. I find you to be a person of integrity. We've done enough to native people.
@dcexaminer We have a treaty with the Native Americans. Violating that is disputable. Ps. Trump invested!!
What is wrong with respecting the NA's and re-routing the pipe? Is respect a naughty word, profit>culture?
In case you didn't notice, DAPL is overwhelmingly unpopular.Wait til veterans return to stand with natives
@dcexaminer Lindsey seriously YOU are no scientist Disaster!!!
@dcexaminer NOOOOOOOO.
Great for Trump's business interests.
nope. Disagree with this strongly. We need alternatives to fossil fuels. Invest for the future.
No, @lindseygrahamsc, genocide and ecocide are terrible decisions no matter how enthusiastic you are over both
You truly are despicable and a hypocrite.
.@LindseyGrahamSC .@realDonaldTrump Yes!
@dcexaminer WRONG.
@dcexaminer
I disagree!
@dcexaminer are you crazy? The pipelines are unnecessary and dangerous to out water supply
This whole administration is full of crooks making themselves richer.
In Trump's favorite words, Wrong! Sad!
NO. Destructive to environment, and lining the pockets of Trump and Perry -- corruption!
#YouCantDrinkOil #WaterIsLife #OilCivilWar #NoDAPL Stop the Black Snake
No, it wasn't. Ever hear of green energy?
@dcexaminer Trump has started wars with women, American Indian tribes, Vets, the Iraqi ppl, and Mexico.
Totally disagree. Should not be making decisions on projects that will benefit his portfolio. #conflictofinterest #divest
No.
@dcexaminer I was a stupid decision. Don't drain the swamp, pump it full of oil!
disgusting
@dcexaminer false.
Nope, and you know it. Sacred land.

I disagree with the renewal of Dakota Access pipeline and Keystone pipeline.  
More risk than benefit.
NO
Your approval of the Keystone and Dakota access pipelines is deplorable.
@dcexaminer Not with ya on this one, my new friend. #resist #StayWokeAndFight #joinus
Not so great for the people in its path. If the #DAPL leaks & spills into the river, the water is no good.
@dcexaminer #NoDAPL Wrong decision. Are trying to make everyone protest?
@dcexaminer But mucho sad to tax margaritas?
@dcexaminer a great decision for Donald, sure. What about everyone else who isn't a billionaire ?
@dcexaminer Can you please not endanger Sioux water sources?  Find a workaround.
@dcexaminer it's a despicable decision. Do u guys ever consider how many will be hurt by this? Or just $$$
@dcexaminer not a great idea. Bad idea. Renewable energy! Let's be the leader!
Should b ashamed of supporting destruction of soil &  BigOil donors
https://youtu.be/TThkWlQsbcM .
@dcexaminer this was not a great decision. Stop and think about the environment, please.
@dcexaminer #trumptoady
NO!
NO NO NO NO NO NO
how quickly my opinion of you can change! We need renewables now - not pipelines with dirty fuels from Canada.
@dcexaminer why? Ruin the environment?
you must not know of thousands of spills from pipelines.
please elaborate why this is a great decision in spite of the environmental and cultural repercussions.
@dcexaminer This is a horrible decision. Support renewable energy not fossil fuels
Apparently you will have to find out the hard way, the people of this country do not want this, period.
I think you all (GOP) should be worrying more about the nut job called #Trump trying to be president.
When the oil leaks into your water supply, how do YOU react?
taking away sacred land & impacting the water supply for our native people is never a good decision. Rethink your ethics!
You are missing two of these. #Resistance #NeverTrustARepublican
#NoDAPL You're a bunch of thieves.
One step forward and two steps back!! DISAPPOINTING. #resist
Hes jealous the natives can run a casino better than him
@dcexaminer No, no it's not. Invest in renewable green energy!
sure if your goal is to potentially poison Americans and hijack sacred Native lands (agains).
#NoDAPL Killing NATIVE AMERICANS DESTROYING ENVIRONMENT & TRAMPLING RTS&LAND IS WRONG! #ResistTrump
actually quite the opposite- once our planet is destroyed by constant oil spills, no amount of $ will help
#cleanenergy is good for the planet and good for your bank account.  Look into it.
The markets will render this oil moot soon enough, if they haven't already.  #NODAPL #NoKeystoneXL
You have never been for the people only the top 1% thanks for proving it again .. why do you vote this way SC?
Wrong!
@dcexaminer 
NOT a great decision. Disappointed in you. Groundwater issues are real. You sold us out again
this is a horrible decision made to profit those with a stake in big oil! #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife
This is a good decision by Trump
@dcexaminer Polluting this planet is NOT a great decision. Invest in renewables, not dirty air and water!
@dcexaminer Seriously? Polluting water, destroying the environment =good decision???#NoDAPL #NoKeystoneXL
Still think so despite giant leak in Iowa's pipeline?!?
Put the pipeline in your backyard then, Mr. Graham.
you are both the worst.
@dcexaminer Oh, Lyndsey. And you were doing so well this week!
.@LindseyGrahamSC How much money is @realDonaldTrump sliding into your pocket to tweet this? Re-election is going to be uphill for you.
Right? He was talking all that shit about him before the election but now he's suckling at the wrinklies.
They're all so disgustingly transparent
I'm kind of done with them all at this point.
For sure. Which is also why I have no problem trolling each and every last one of them.
lolol
no! protect Native American lands!
@dcexaminer I respectfully disagree.  I'm surprised that u would feel this way.  Isn't SC pro environment?
@dcexaminer I disagree completely. #greedy
@dcexaminer Of course, Trump has ties to the companies that will do it not to mention they're Canadians.
I wholeheartedly disagree. Please listen to Native Americans & scientists from all over the country & reconsider.
@dcexaminer ignorance is bliss and OMG there must be a lot of koolaid going around
you are WRONG!
@dcexaminer so it would be ok to run the pipelines next to your house and source of water ?
. Make them route the pipeline around the tribe's land!  Can't we have a compromise here?!
so sad
Too bad they don't run through Congress' water supply. You might have a different opinion then.
how's it feel to be a witness to the destruction of the planet?
As expected, @GOP side with party before country. Doesn't seem to be a courageous one in the bunch.
@realDonaldTrump
if K/DAPL is such a great idea, why the need to silence the EPA? TERRIBLE idea is what you mean to say.
@dcexaminer This will be your legacy, Senator. Stand up against the ignorance.
will it matter how rich you are when there is no water to drink? You cant buy another planet. #NoDAPL
Run one through your water supply so your family's water supply gets poisoned.
(2/2)  millions of US lives at risk.  Water = Life.
(1/2) There is nothing about this that benefits the US.  A Canadian co selling oil to China & puts
@dcexaminer I was just starting to almost respect you. SMH 
despicable. Lindsey your family must be so proud!
@dcexaminer So much for that tiny bit of credibility you'd recently garnered. Shame on you!
Saving that tweet to throw back at you when the pipe starts leaking #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife
There won't be anyone left to write it!
thank you for putting aside the health and safety of the #American people and nation so a few may #profit
Oh my! I sure do hope the good folks of Iowa feel the same as they deal w/their broken pipeline.140k g SAD
Just wondering, have either of you gone hiking in a national park?
@dcexaminer #NoDAPL #NoBanNoWall Please make America sane again.
@dcexaminer Actually this is horrible...Very few jobs.  $ in Trump's pockets.  Moving backward not forward
Do you just not care about all the CO2 going into the atmosphere? #ClimateChangeIsReal
Senator, why persist w/ fossil fuels? Proven clean tech in Tesla, etc. Use your influence! Would appreciate a reply.
Does it not bother you that he has a financial stake stake in this?
Great decision?  You must have stock in the company.
Nope, it sucks.
I had almost started to like you. sigh.
@dcexaminer great for who? Big oil?
Yeah, b/c destroying the environment is an American value.
#45 has conflicts of interest here that should be investigated.
@dcexaminer so no #conflictsofinterest here? #ReleaseTheReturns #Unfit45 #Illegitimate45 #NoTrumperica
@dcexaminer
@dcexaminer new pipes for Canadian oil but not for American children? #FlintWaterCrisis
and repubican party don't care about what the majority of Americans want. Sad
Well this sucks, but keep pointing out his lies. At least someone in the GOP is willing to call him out
I was hoping you were going to be the voice of sanity. Guess not. And Rex Tillerson? Do you even have a backbone?
and just when I'd started to respect you. You cannot run rampant over Native land!
So I guess you don't care about drinking water
I knew the love affair wouldn't last. Why are corporations more important than people? Pipeline over the Saluda? Why not?
Disgusting. I am in yr district and will be voting you out. I thought you might have been growing a spine.
Yes!! Let's vote him out. He almost had me fooled. Not again
@dcexaminer how is this a great decision. How
@dcexaminer yeah, great plan! Destroy our planet vs utilizing & sustaining it for corp. profit.
@dcexaminer yes for our illegitimate 45. Profiteering and violating constitution ok w/u? No honor.  11/18
Why don't YOU build YOUR families house over a pipeline then in 10 years we can revisit the issue
Not!
find your conscience again
We'll never know if it was a great decision by @realDonaldTrump or just a decision to make a few more dollars.
You make me sick to my stomach. Money is worth more than your integrity?
Regarding Trump / pipelines, do you think your grandchildren will think it's a "great idea"? Take the long view
What about when he banned EPA employees from updating press. Isn't that illegal? They do that in Russia!
where did your backbone go. So disappointed! Not one republican that truly cares for the country. Sad sad!
People are going to die behind this, Senator. Not from the potential spills, I mean protesters. Will die.
@dcexaminer he does nothing about the water in Flint but will poison the water along the pipelines.
@dcexaminer Disagree!!!!!!
Even though he has invested interest in the Pipeline Co.? He still owns stock in the company, right?
@dcexaminer Faux patriots:
BREAKING: Trump administration preparing executive orders to drastically reduce U.S. role in UN, other international groups: New York Times
@ReutersUS Single handedly approved Russias new sphere of influence, this will be remembered
It's a ridiculous decision @LindseyGrahamSC. This provides no benefit to the USA but all of the oil spill risks. Very Bad!
@realDonaldTrump
has @POTUS assured you that he has no financial dealings here?
@dcexaminer Glad to see you are "Getting on the Trump Train" Mr. Graham! You know to get in line finally!
You may like the policy, but he owns stock in the company building the pipeline.Corrupt! #showusyourtaxes
DISAGREE. This is about making fossil fuel companies rich at the expense of our kids' futures. #NoDAPL
@dcexaminer AND WATER BOARDING?!
