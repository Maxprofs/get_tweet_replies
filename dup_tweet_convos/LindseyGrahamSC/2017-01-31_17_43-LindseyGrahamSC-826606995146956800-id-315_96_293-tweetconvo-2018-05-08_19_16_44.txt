Voters KNOW that Gorsuch favored BIG CORPS over THE PEOPLE in his rulings so go ahead & play with your future elections.
Better wait for hearings before endorsing someone!Fascism Forever-Not a great club to found & be president of 4 yrs of HS!
Hypocrites! Seriously what comes out of the GOP mouths. How they can sleep & pray anymore is beyond me. Greed and power.
Let's let @LindseyGrahamSC  know we haven't forgotten what they did re Merrick Garland. Call (202) -224-5972
Yes
(It seems that @LindseyGrahamSC has forgotten that Trump humiliated him BIGLY, YUGELY, & PUBLICLY. Blackmail maybe?)
.@freespeak3 @LindseyGrahamSC  That too.. but I guess Graham, among other GOP in Congress, has selective memory issues.
Don't know order, but GOP men who lost their dignity to Trump:
@LindseyGrahamSC
@SenJohnMcCain
@SenTedCruz
@MittRomney
@marcorubio
, Ben Carson, Jeb! Bush, just to name a few
yep! i'll even throw in Carly.
sops
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenTedCruz @MittRomney @marcorubio
Amazing, isn't it? The way he humiliated them? @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenTedCruz @MittRomney @marcorubio
in all seriousness, yes it is. That's why i consider blackmail

@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenTedCruz @MittRomney @marcorubio
.@LindseyGrahamSC  Hypocrite. We haven't forgotten what you did regarding Obama's pick of Merrick Garland!
@ElishivaAhmose He is a perfect pick, Sir!!
you are a traitor to the people!
Why wasn't that courtesy given to Obama appointee Merrick Garland?
#Garland
just another pig at the trough
what's wrong with you people? Are you drinking the water from Flynt Michigan?We WILL fight for civil rights, you know that?
leave the seat empty like it's been for over a year.  it's a stolen seat anyway.
Fascism Forever!
what u say carries no weight u have been so anti trump that you just frankly look stupid did you sleep through the election
Fair enough, but DeVos is horrific.  Please vote NO!  HHI constituent concerned about public education.
your wrong
hereâ€™s my statement on him
But DeVos is a no hitter. She doesn't understand growth/proficiency & thinks public school is a dead end. Vote #NoonDeVos.
this
Agree Gorsuch deserves a vote.  How do you reconcile your beliefs with your office saying Garland didn't deserve the same?
Too bad the GOP stole the seat
Except that he is illegitimate, because the Senate did not do its duty and give Merrick Garland a vote. #ShameShameShame
.@LindseyGrahamSC I could have sworn Obama nominated a third justice...  Don't let integrity stand in your way though.
GARLAND! YOU SAD LITTLE HYPOCRITE! So, sick of the tired GOP lines when they did nothing but obstruct for 8 years.
Merrick Garland, at least have the courtesy and courage to mention him!
Merrick Garland.
Faor enough but Betsy DeVos is clearly NOT qualified for the job of SOE. Please reconsider your decision about her.
No, that was Merrick Garland. This is a stolen seat. You are asking for courtesy for Gorsuch that Garland was denied.
Your party blocked Garland why should you call on everyone to get in board with a literal jurist?
Garland wasn't.
You should have voted on Garland.  You need to pray that the Koch Bros have enough money to save you...traitor!
THIS IS YET ANOTHER TRAVESTY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! YOU SIR ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AS IS COMRADE TRUMP.
OPPOSE! OPPOSE! OPPOSE!
Please stop Sessions and the autocracy. Please.
Merrick Garland
.@LindseyGrahamSC where we're these principles with respect to #MerrickGarland? Not a trap question, an honest inquiry.
also, just noticed the typo. Not sure why auto complete chose that version of what I was typing. #ProofreadingIsImportant
have to ask - where was courtesy when president of the U.S. nominated a moderate and you wouldn't give him the time of day?
You forgot to mention Garland.
Why aren't you answering your phones? None of your offices are picking up. COWARD! Listen to your constituents!
again severe doubts  with regards to your judgement sir. Looks like you drank the koolaide
no. #MerrickGarland or bust. "Elections have consequences" 
Merrick Garland was legal too. Stop playing games with a fascist
Are all of GOP suffering from memory problems? May I request you google a man called 'Merrick Garland' & see what you did.
Every time I start to think you're okay, you fall right back in line with those putting party over country.
what was that about Merrick Garland....I'll wait.
I take you at your word, Senator. Did you ask of yourself that Merrick Garland deserved a vote?
Speaking of scumbags, everyone at the State Dept proves more qualified to be Sec State than Exxon sanction-breaker.
Did you bang your head and get amnesia? Dont you remember Merrick Garland?
Sir, this disingenuous pretense about what you and your colleagues did regarding Judge Garland should be beneath you.
You all should be ashamed for never voting on Merrick Garland.
America expects u to vote for Sessions.Ur a republican do Ur job and vote for him today
disgusting you put a racist @POTUS before America just because of party.  #WeWillWin #DoYourJob .  I had respect, but :-(
Merrick Garland should receive a hearing.  If not, the GOP has stolen a President's choice for Supreme Court in Garland.
two words. Merrick Garland. You did not stand up for @POTUS44 right to confirm a justice. He deserved consideration
Is there a fake Republican (ALT_FACTer) with male genitalia, even one with Goering-sized 'very smalls' anywhere?
But shouldn't the pick belong to the next president? Isn't that how we do things?
So why no vote on Garland? Certainly qualified.
I agree Gorsuch is a decent man and qualified; however, so was Garland. You helped poison the well last year.
you are not honorable nor fit to serve for the public or any government office. Please leave now in disgrace. #Flop, #Sad!!
You left one out.   Sure you just forgot.
You were wrong about Garland and used the late term as an excuse.There was time + you +@GOP refused to work move. Bad form.
Can't we have them stall for 24 months until the GOP loses all of their seats for being spineless imbeciles?
then why did you sit on your hands for Merrick?
Merrick Garland?
agree with this pick and your support.
Trump is a threat -according to head of European Council- and they are our closest allies.  Gorsuch at least is intelligent
My statement needs only two words: Merrick Garland.
.@LindseyGrahamSC How about a statement explaining your rational re: #MerrickGarland what happened there?
And to think I enjoyed imagining your hypothetical revolving cabinet of first ladies! GOOD DAY, SIR.
yeah but you stole it from @POTUS44 who has almost a year left. I hope the Senate Democrats fight like hell
#MerrickGarland
I don't care after @SenateGOP refused to even give garland a hearing. Leave it empty there have been less
Perfectly reasonable. But your Party chose to deny Pres. Obama his rightful opportunity to fill this seat. So, screw you!
glad to see you not take the same position as Chuck Schumer. You still disgust me Flimsy.
Shameful Garland didn't have the same opportunity.
can we dump Trump yet?
The GOP is pushing an illegitimate Supreme Court Justice nominee to fill the seat stolen from Judge Merrick Garland.../1
"@LindseyGrahamSC: My statement on the selection of Judge Gorsuch for the..Court." How do you justify #MerrickGarland not getting a hearing?
the same courtesy as you gave Garland?

, I think you understand how much @SenateMajLdr & @ChuckGrassley poisoned the atmosphere on the Hill re: #SCOTUS nominees.
, President Obama was elected to a 4-year term, as per the Constitution. @SenateMajLdr chose to ignore that re: #Garland.
Another guy who isn't sure people like me have the right to an education!  Alright!///sarcasm
Merrick Garland
But, sir, one must then ask: Was Garland not supremely qualified?

More, why not an eight-judge court? It's worked so far.
President Obama nominated 3--left off imminently qualified Merrick Garland. That's the type of respect you should expect
Mr. Graham, you have tucked your proverbial genitalia and bought into trumpism. Sad af!
maybe this great state of SC should think of replacing you. Not sure you are on our team
how exactly did you vote on Merrick Garland?  I forget.
it's still a stolen seat.
And you should have given Garland a vote.


we don't like Gorsuch
should he get the Garland treatment???
Why didn't Garland get a hearing?
keep your judge out of my uterus!!!!#womensrightsarehumanrights #mybodymychoice
. I agree, but anger over Garland still abounds and with good reason.
Then DO NOT confirm DeVos! Do not be a hypocrite. Practice what you preach! Our children matter more than your party.
Why didn't you vote for Merrick Garland?
You make a lot of bad votes. Suppose you voted for #SallyYates too. smh
Merrick Garland
forgot to mention the respect shown for Merrick Garland
And how about Merrick Garland??  Forgot about him already?
You should have afforded Merrick Garland similar courtesy.  Hypocrites really are the worst, don't you think?
@RoScarborough oh crap.  I thought it was a good pick.  Maybe not if GrahNasty likes.
Hoping the Dems will hold off on the hearing 'til after the impeachment.
#SCOTUS confirmation should go like this:
Senator: Are you Merrick Garland?
Gorsuch: Uh, no.
Senator: No further questions.
Bullshit. For once look out for your fellow Americans.
this selection doesn't seem 2 represent the will of the people (ya know, the popular vote).   is prob cool with it tho.
It takes lots of nerve to pat yourself on the back for voting 4 2 of Obama's nominees after ignoring his 3rd. #UnAmerican.
Sad thing is your are not for LGBT..
Judge Gorsuch should be treated with the same courtesy GOP gave Merrick Garland.
@staceyncgirl  GRAHAM UR OPINION IS NOT IMPORTANT. JUST VOTE HIM IN #MAGA
What about Merrick Garland??
sir. I believe you left out Merrick Garland. He was granted neither consideration nor courtesy.
karma is a bitch isn't it?  #StopGorsuch
NOPE, u don't get to "forget" Garland.U STOLE from Obama and 51% of voters who reelected him.Theft shall not be rewarded.
but what about women's rights?
my fav repub rn, standing up for what's right with humor and poise  May not always agree on policy, but mucho respect!
lovely statement with the huge omission of Merrick Garland. What were you asking of yourself for those 300+ days?
you don't get to sit in your tower after dragging your feet for Garland who is also super qualified.
like, maybe we could wait almost a year for this confirmation. You know, save it for Trump's successor.
, grateful that you stood up to @POTUS, but this statement w/o recognition of Garland hold-up is insulting.Please be better.
#MerrickGarland4SCOTUS
Thank you Senator for supporting Judge Gorsuch.
and what about voting for #MerrickGarland?
Did you push to vote on Garland?  If not, be quiet.
kiss off!  Tired of you & your cronies who do little but fly around bitching about things you personally have failed to do
He can get that courtesy after Garland gets it. If that doesn't happen, Gorsuch doesn't deserve it.
Merrick. Freaking. Garland.
@SenateMajLdr @chuckschumer @SenWarren @BernieSanders  Garland should have been considered
You blocked merrick garland. You have no right to put up your own pick.  This is despicable.
bad decision
Merrick Garland says "hi".
Just become a Demoncrat and be done with it.  You are an embarrassment to the Republican Party.
Senator Graham, you continue to embarrass yourself.  It didn't take you long to be a Trump clone.  Sad.
wrong
He's your buddy Lindsey. Doesn't make him the best choice.
- we don't care what u or John McCain say anymore / your irrelevant - u sold American people down the river for YOUR GOOD !
this is a joke right ?? You have Obama nominee zero respect
is a #TrumpWhipped #lickspittle
I'm sure GOP thinks he Great . Too bad you stole Obama nominee and now it's your turn to get obstruction.
@senjudiciary Fuck him!He supports HobbyLobby's discrimination of birthControlPills under #FakeChristianity but coverViagra
what about your refusal to consider Garland ? #liar
With your treated Merrick Garland, your statement sounds almost comical.  Now Dem may wait until the People decide in 2018
And what about Garland? Don't be a hypocrite.
I wish all Repub. could be like you I am a Canadian Liberal and u r the 1st GOP I can get behind & don't want to smack
according to the Constitution, Merrick Garland should have gotten a vote. #hypocrisy #obstructionists #ImpeachTrump
Selling your soul for a SCOTUS pick. Nice work, Lindsey.
And you are party to the stolen seat.  You held Merrick Garland's nomination hostage for nearly a year.  Shame on you.
