How to solve healthcare... demand the rescission of all healthcare benefits that the congress now receives for FREE.  It's that simple. Rk
I WANT universal health care.  Not this dog and pony idea which hurts many.  Let Congress give up their care or POTUS.  BAFOONUSHNESS, GOP.
Not perfect It'll be adjusted but what is Ans? D's rammed through ACA & its failing. Better  StateControl & TrialOptions than Disaster #MAGA
The states have the ability to set up their own policies and exchanges though the ACA. Layoff the talk radio and think for yourself.
The Whores of Capitol Hill are at it again.


Federalsim? The way you're all taking bribes? McCarthyism is more like it. You are robbing USA blind for your RACIST bigoted ACA vengeance
And a disaster for people with pre-existing conditions.

This bill will let the sick die.
No it is bad bill that will cost millions their health care

What are you doing to the American people? What is wrong with you guys
How do u feel selling your soul to the devil.
I actually believed you had a conscience. There are 50 million Americans who will take to the streets. It's time to stop the madness.
It's easy to sponsor a healthcare bill when you and the other 425 members of congress@enjoy FREE HEALTHCARE. time to get in the boat with us

It's a triumph for screwing over the country! Stop playing games with people's lives!

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
No it is not. Letting states decide is a triumph of Federalism.
Let's have an experiment on federalism and give a couple states to the Objectivists & let them have their Utopia. They'll be back in a week.
Is Medicare "socialism"? Is the VA "socialism"? Is the HC plan that congress gets "socialism"? Why no outcry about that?
#hypocrites #FuckU
I like this bill, and the redistribution of funds is quite logical. But, I really hope we we don't need $190 T to cover healthcare by 2026.
more lies and fake news from @LindseyGrahamSC . you have even brainwashed yourself into believing the Cassidy fairy tale lies. Resign now!

BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…

#GrahamCassidy is not federalism. It is #kleptocracy. Steal from the middle class to give to the wealthy. Shame on you, Lindsey.
If this bill is so great, wait for the CBO score.  But then Americans would see how devastating it actually is.  Lindsey,
Graham , you and your cohorts are pathetic!  Taking healthcare away from people to appease that so called WH is ridiculous!!!!
Shame on you Senator Lindsey Graham.
Gotta dust off the old civics text; I had no idea premature deaths and bankruptcies constituted a triumph of federalism.
Not according to Graham's own words from May 2017...but I know, details, details. GOP hates being troubled w/details (aka American lives).

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
What makes a human like @LindseyGrahamSC /@GOP take joy and pride in taking away health care from millions of people? Deplorables speak up!
I thought you had a heart. I've changed my mind. This bill is bs and you know it.
Lying sack of pink marshmallow.
@LindseyGrahamSC @theodorekupfer Then why does it take from blue states to give to red states?  That's SOCIALISM & u admitted to it.
It's a triumph of the future murder of millions of americans who will lose healthcare.  @LindseyGrahamSC you should be ashamed of yourself!

Disgusted and disappointed with you Lindsey Graham.
CHIP is a horrible program,  stop lying unless you know what you're talking about.
@LindseyGrahamSC You have confused federalism with feudalism. Maybe brush up on history, economics, government & ethics. #HealthCareForAll
@LindseyGrahamSC shows he is truly bought by Koch dollars.
The deaths of so many on your hands. Why do something 12 % want? Support single payer competitive provider. #SaveACA
#LyingLindsey, @SenJohnMcCain promised compromise, promised debate, promised to do what's right for Americans, not big insurance companies.
I'm glad it's a triumph for something because it sure isn't a triumph for peoples' healthcare.
#GrahamCassidy Is a #VILE plan that #HURTS Americans, it takes care AWAY FROM 25,000,000 people ONLY a #LYING #HYPOCRITE would say its good.
#GrahamCassidy takes healthcare AWAY from 25,000,000 Americans! #CruelAndUnusual
#GrahamCassidy Is a #CRUEL #JOKE
#GrahamCassidy Is a #FAILURE
I think you have a typo there, it should read, "...of fascism". Also the insurers making handsome profits will tell u ACA is not socialism
How do you people sleep at night?  You are reprehensible.
You don't work for the Republican majority. You work for the people of SC. Maybe you should go talk to some of them about your proposal.
You mean it's the triumph of evil greedy people robbing people of healthcare! Shame on you! You'll have to answer to your maker.
How will you explain your greed? Tell your children and grandchildren you killed people by stripping them of healthcare!
And a tragedy for the average American.
U have SOLD YOUR SOUL 4 the approval of the MOST DEPLORABLE person on the planet. I'm MORTIFIED u represent my state.

Just stop - stop pushing through a bill to take away what you don't want to deal with! Just stop!
So you and your heartless Senators will take responsibility for the death of a defenseless human?
The new GOP health care repeal means premature infants could hit the lifetime cap before even leaving the hospital: http://bit.ly/2f5SotS 

So if you're going to do the socialism vs federalism crap, then I guess you want to get rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
Once SC gets Obamacare off its back, its health care will be as good as its roads.



Sen. Graham is a liar. Returning rights to states & consumer, my foot! Graham's ridiculous bill BANS coverage for a LEGAL medical procedure.
Cruel, heartless, uncaring, evil!  No on trump (and republicans) don't care!
@LindseyGrahamSC you should be ashamed and embarrassed that this heartless bill bears your name. #HistoryWillNotReflectKindlyOnYou
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @SenDeanHeller @RonJohnsonWI 
Do this and the American people will devour your party. That is a promise.
Federalism my ass.Millions lose healthcare, no CBO score & Koch gives u millions if u get this done. Where is Honor over Party? Disgraceful.
You worship at the altar of Capital & your "triumph" is rich pharmaceutical & insurance companies and politicians reaping $$$$ off the sick.
A Triumph ??? How about Catastrophe 4 America.
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
#GrahamCassidy is a conspiracy to kill. Disgraceful!
Ur really good at coming up w plans that don't effect u. I guess it's just ur way of telling the rest of us to go to hell.
A triumph of feudalism, more likely.
Get that stupid smile off your face
GOD IS NOT IMPRESSED WITH YOUR GRAHAM-CASSIDY HAWGWASH!  IT IS CRUEL, COLD BLOODED & PURE ASSED EVIL. IT HAS UR NAME ON IT!  SHAME ON U!
GRAHAM/CASSIDY IS THE SPAWN OF HORRIBLE GREED & AVARICE & AN INDICTMENT OF FEDERALISM! IF PASSED YOU'LL BE BRANDED A COLD BLOODED MURDERER!
@Lawrence @MSNBC Will @realDonaldTrump's Comrades @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @RepRohrabacher @SenatorBurr be Questioned about Russia Ties?
Triumph of Federalism much like Mississippi, Kansas & NRO. Redistribution and the Koch Bros. WPA for the unemployable right.
Calling bullsh*t on this horrible bill!!!!!
It's a triumph of cruelty. It guts medicaid, hurting children, seniors and the disabled. It will lead to 32 million MORE uninsured! Shameful
Then debate then Bill if you think your sooo into federalism! Let's debate and let it be scored instead of ramming in thru! Your a con !
Embarrassed you are from SC.. Shameless
Lindsey, you don't look well. I would suggest you retire but you get better healthcare in DC

No it's still Obamacare lite!
Bought and paid for by the Insurance companies.  Shame on you @LindseyGrahamSC for selling out to Insurance lobby.
GrahamCassidy is a legacy that will make certain you both will go down in history as evil, hate filled men who worked hard to destroy lives
if people dying is what federalism looks like - no thanks!  we'll take what germany or sweden has - socialism?
Falsely yelling federalism to get attention and screwing Americans in the process doesn't seem like what the Founding Fathers had in mind
What an absolute crock.  One's quality of healthcare depends on where they live.  (Good luck to red-staters) So much for UNITED States!
Brought and sold how much did you get to sell the American people out
You should be ashamed. This is horrible.
Gross
#GrahamCassidy is not bipartisan solution to American healthcare! PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS MUST BE COVERED IN FIX FOR #ACA. Shame on you!
Pre-existing clause alone reveals just how evil and vile you are.
Bullshi t
The bill is a total disaster & the"socialism"quip is not funny. I wish the rest of the country could have my Medicare plan. #GrahamCassidy
This is nothing but an OUTRAGEOUS lie.  This bill is an abomination.  Shame on you.
NO. This is another bad bill. Sorry, but this bill is awful. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
#GrahamCassidy is a travesty that will take healthcare away from millions of Americans.
It's dreadful contrarian policy that solves no problems.
If it was really about federalism, would just give $ to states and let them each create own systems - including single payer.
The AARP, American Medical Association, March of Dimes, American Lung Association, the American Heart Association and JDRF disagree.

GC takes money from some states and gives to others. Because federalism?!?

Really? How is telling a state that it can't set up a single payer system Federalism?
Remember when Romneycare was a triumph of federalism. Wait that was Obamacare.


It's unconscionable and inhumane. Shame on @LindseyGrahamSC. SHAME. 
#Graham is an officer, but is no gentleman. @LindseyGrahamSC doesn't care how veterans or POWs are denigrated or denied care.#iserved #USAF
It's a triumph of meanness. There. Fixed it for you.
False rhetoric/false comparison.  @LindseyGrahamSC does seem "compromised" though. Even Russia has better insurance than what he proposes.
SC constituents calling Grahams office to ask abt the genesis of the bill & some of the staff rude RUDE & DISMISSIVE. SHAMEFUL! Embarrassed?
@SenateMajLdr and @GOP only care about donor money and party politics, not constituents. We now have taxation without representation.
If giving control  to the states was the solution,  Texas would be leading the way and showing us how bad the ACA is
Hateful.  You should be ashamed.
@LindseyGrahamSC , Senator Graham you just lied to Americans on National Television about your death care. Tax break for Koch brothers.
I was beginning to think you had some feeling for people, I guessed wrong with your Graham/Cassidy bill.
PROVE it w a CBO score!
The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16330094/cassidy-graham-hypocrisy?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … via @voxdotcom
It's my death/debt panel. #noGrahamCassidy
State legislatures aren't passing their own health insurance legislation. That would be federalism. This bill does not represent federalism.
What a disgusting way to roll out a health care plan. Very few details on plan. This is a plan that affects 1/5 of US economy.
This BILL IS A POS! the sheer cruelty behind it is just astounding. You can't even have a REAL hearing that's how bad this is.
Graham Cassidy is shameful.  Absolutely SHAMEFUL

Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
How can you say sending healthcare to the states! No coverage mental illness,pre-existing conditions, pregnancy & more. Be ashamed!
Is Medicare federalist? Do you deal with pharmaceutical companies and private industry health providers in your plan?
Just another GOP bill rammed down the people's throats. You work for the people. The people deserve the same healthcare as congress.
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  

Only an idiot would want this.
SHAME SHAME SHAME!!! Save the ACA
LEAVE OBAMACARE ALONE!!! SHAME ON YOU for being in the pockets of the big insurance lobby

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
1) it's immoral -  it allows insurance companies to price out the sick.
2) It shows #GrahamCassidy talk from both sides of mouth on CBO:
With no CBO score.  Wow.
Ur draconian bill will hurt our veterans along w/our most vulnerable & millions of Americans & for what? Tax cuts! Disgusting & shameful!!!
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out AGAINST new #GrahamCassidy ACA repeal bill
If there is 80 billion for the military, there is $$ for healthcare for all. Do what is right for the people, not the lobbyists.
Here I thought you weren't @StephenBannon hack, tearing down gov't to reform in Koch's image. @SenateGOP traitors. You too @SenJohnMcCain ?
Then vote Obama Care out, don't vote any healthcare in, and let's see if the States really want that. I don't think so.
Tell the states they have to provide funding and medical care to all their residents or provide none. Total Chaos for the medical community.
That is Federalism. This is not a civics bill, it is a healthcare bill aimed at helping everyone, not just one party, obtain healthcare.
