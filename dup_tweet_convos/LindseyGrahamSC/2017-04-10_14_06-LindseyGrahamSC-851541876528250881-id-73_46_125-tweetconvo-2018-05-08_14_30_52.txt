hope they didn't drag you out of your seat
Pork
How much did that cost the American taxpayer? Did you have fun?
How much did Lockheed contribute senator graham. This military industrial complex owns you all...Dems included.
He got $132,000 in 2016 from defense contractors.
Thank you
Wowzie....oh boy look at the planes!!!! So pretty and shiny and fast.  Isn't life just grand!
What a day!
Interesting. I hope SC workers are fairing better with Lockheed than they are with Boeing. SC workers are lowest paid in aeronautics in US!
You crave war like a psychopath.
"T" designates a trainer airframe. Training is education. Spending money on education is a good investment. Throwing money at war is not.
It's training for war. Wrong kind of education.
That was my point!
Alright you ready to fly over the skies of Syria to police it?
Don't spend too much on planes and neglect our soldiers, or their mothers, or their children, or their teachers, or those they protect.
Outside investigation of Trump & Russia. .@SpeakerRyan  .@SenMajLeader  Start caring about the middle class.
I hoped you puked on your shoes.
Better than being on a United flight out of Chicago for sure.
Must be nice not having to worry like most Americans.
Right?!
The "paid endorsement" disclaimer is missing from this ad.
Lucky it wasn't a United flight, they might have thrown you off.
@TheRickWilson 
Just don't do it $3mil a week worth like your pres does. Or piss it away #operationpothole
@USAGSessions says COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME. Do you believe that? INDICT @POTUS GRAFT TREASON #trumprussia
Wonder what that cost us  taxpayers?
fuck a jet ya'll taking away peoples healthcare wise up
We got jets up the ass. So many the AF want to throw away F15/16s.  We need and we want Health Care.  Represent us.
Wow how do you get that ticket?
Sure seems like there are better ways to spend $. Like, maybe, on education? Healthcare? Americans?
On impeaching trump.
Wasted $$$s
Plz...just shutthefuckup and then die quietly in a gutter down some dark alley somewhere that you denied health care to.
Nice way to spend the day,Linds!dora
How much did @LockheedMartin dump into your campaign fund, Senator Bought and Paid For? This, THIS, is why people hate Congress.
why didnt you fly straight on to syria together with JohnMcCain?
You're lucky they didn't drag you off if Trump showed up and wanted to go for a ride
@TheRickWilson @LockheedMartin  looks like a MIG u f'n sell out #russiagate
#trumprussia #trumpRICO..that is all there is right now.
And I'm sure you and others in Congress have plenty of stock in Lockheed. Americans aren't stupid.
It might be. A Russian loving administration, however, is NOT good for America.
I can think of a better deal for America. Impeach the mental tyrant you support, even though you know he's a major threat. Country first!!
In Russia, plane fly you.
Your cronyism at work.
Graham's military service was in the JAG corps. 
couldnt get on United i guess
As I said, knew you'd understand it, not necessarily fly in it!  #fun
Good for you! Meanwhile, the rest of us peons are down here getting screwed over by GOP corporatist regime
Did McCain sit in your lap during? Happy times Butters!
Is it a good deal for the personal wealth of TrumpLand? Do you, Donald Trump, and/or his gang own stock in Lockheed-Martin, perhaps?
Can we get back to Trump Russia collusion please? K thanks!
Looks Like A Great Deal But These Funds Are Needed To Build @realDonaldTrump's Wall. "They're Pouring In"
Lucky he wasn't flying United
@TheRickWilson @LockheedMartin really? I want to like this but I do nit think I will ever fly
Does this count as your military service for the month? #worthless
Good thing you didn't fly United Airlines today.
@TheRickWilson @LockheedMartin Awesome!!!
Why don't you fly the next bombing mission to Syria Mr. Gungho War Monger and Trump apologist? Ashamed of my SC Senatot.
How about affordable healthcare for all citizens? #wrongwaygop

And Trump/Bannon troupe? What are they? ...since you have all the answers that for millennia we have been seeking.  ;)
LUCKYYYY!!!! THE PERKS!!!
Unlike complicit, colluding GOP Congress, which is proving daily to be a bad deal for America. Where is your patriotism? #TrumpRussia
Oh I was wondering where the money for education, infrastructure, healthcare, social security, paid leaves etc. went.
VERY NICE!!
Bet you weren't dragged off the plane because of over-booking.
