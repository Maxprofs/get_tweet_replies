Sen. Graham I think you are doing a great job!  I'm your biggest fan in Missouri.  Your words and actions are #1
I'll pass.

Small man deficiency sindrom want to go to war
Cooperation in our government is only a dream. Continue pushing. Maybe someday.
You are a great American sir

Watching now. Liberal Democrat who would strongly consider Lindsay Graham for President based on this interview.
on @greta @MSNBC is an embarrassment to his profession and his Air Force career. #small Even more than Greta..
Doubt U R sincere in hunt 4 treason in WH - if U R gunning 4 Comey, don't. Covering UR own tail? We will see.
You blocked the Black President and Slandered the Woman with No Ties to Putin and no Pay to Play. Now you repent?

That McCain knows how to be a Patriot and Rand knows how to gel his curls?
McCain=everyone but Graham in cahoots with Russia
