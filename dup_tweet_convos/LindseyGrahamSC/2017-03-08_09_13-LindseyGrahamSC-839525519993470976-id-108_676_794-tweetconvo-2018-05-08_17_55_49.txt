So every baseless charge @realDonaldTrump makes you are gonna run and order investigations?  Waste of tax $$$
his libel against Obama is impeachable
And Comey let Hillary off the hook therefore Comey can hide things??
what miss piggy?
HE IS YOUR PRESIDENT whether you like it or not, get ove it!!!!!!!
not for long miss piggy.  Trump is going to JAIL!!!!!  on yourface
Your really not worth my time Trump is your @POTUS  like it or not grow up
he is a traitor piece of shit that will "die" in jail
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for investigating this and for realizing this Russia conspiracy is just a smear campaigne.No evidence
ROFL Don't think this is being done for the reasons you think it is. Trump just signed his own walking papers @LindseyGrahamSC
exactly.  What a dummy Sherry.  He knows Trumps claim is BS.  Graham is one of the only R's with a spine
its crazy.  I remember thinking how could jim jones get all those people to drink the coolade?
youre a sheep
your pipeline is getting built with russian steel comrade. Not america first, but its ok that he lued again. Baaaa, baaa
history will look back at the sheep and wonder how they became so fucking brainwashed
Thank you, Senator @LindseyGrahamSC. If true, then we expect prosecution. If another Trump lie, impeachment.
If a lie how did they get Flynn's conversations with Russia? Tapped phone..
Monitoring of Russian communications is an ongoing effort. Flynn got caught in the process.
Flynn got caught because of CIA leaks and listening to conversations thru wikileaks
@LindseyGrahamSC.  And just when are they going to request Tax returns?  We want to see them.
his tax returns are not just a curiosity! They are a large missing piece of an investigation(S)!
Lindsey Graham and McCain are probably part of the scheme. Low life politicians!
Glad to see you are an EX-Democrat. Welcome to the Republican party! @frankthorp @alexiskweed
@LindseyGrahamSC where is the third alarm; that this charge was a reaction to a conspiracy theory driven by a tabloid?
Tabloids are where trump gets his info!
Hopefully Lindsey will catch and express train straight to HELL
This is a waste of time.  So when they find no wiretap can @realDonaldTrump be held for libel?
@LindseyGrahamSC Thanks LG! We really want to hear the TRUTH! Bless Trumps heart...
Evidence was found that was creditable enough 2 persue & they know that Trump had some type of Intel done & worded correctly!
Evidence is clear, wiretapping is real. Dem Congressman from OH said it happened to him under Obama admin.
@jerweber 
BREAKING NEWS 
D.J.T. Reports Boggy Man
In Closet
Asking For. Complete 
Investigation
@LindseyGrahamSC If they exist, then probable cause of illegal activities exist, too. What will you do if taps implicate djt?
@LindseyGrahamSC How about investigating DJT & cab Russia collusion? DJT could have asked FBI. U r still shilling 4 him
@LindseyGrahamSC careful what you ask for....oh wait maybe that's the plan?
@LindseyGrahamSC #voteoutgrahamnow
@LindseyGrahamSC see @LouiseMensch ask for FISA re Alfa and another bank
Shame  on u!

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C46TT29VcAAvAcp.jpg â€¦
FBI / AG replied: "Dear senators the DOJ can't comment on open investigations go back to do ur job & we will do ours" #WAKEUPUSA
this a good thing? Will it probably put an end to this Russia hoax
Wouldn't trust Lindsey with my worst enemy.
Trump Tower is broad. How many RU operatives and handlers have space there?
wiretaps not all they are looking for!
@LindseyGrahamSC where's the furor over the fucking Russians ???
DT has thrown this false claim out, to distract from his ties to Russia
Good luck getting that, COMEY already told the FBI TO NOT do anything.
Not every1 is a fool.  Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump s over foreign business deals/ ties
love it. How d'ya like me now, cheetolian?
IF there are wire taps in ttower maybe Putin keeping an ear out on DT? So  many corrupt ppl in the trumps lives.
@LindseyGrahamSC RepubAdmin has hissy fit n tweet we investigate.RepubAdmin fam&advisors &AG lie abt mtgs w Russians &nothing?
No evidence from Trump. Just a diversion. The real issue is that Trump is owned by Putin #russiagate
Well-written letter Senator @LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for framing the issues in this manner for the public.
@gayCAsportsfan Presumably the answer will be NO. What will Trump tweet then? "Ok but Obama is still a bad hombre" ?
And we're off!
@LindseyGrahamSC what if there's nothing there? Besides confirming the President is a liar
And so Congress shall investigate the lie. Does POTUS realize what he has done?
Gotcha War! thnx pic.twitter.com/9nDfTdntOVFYI @ignatiuspost @howardfineman @USAToday @thedailynews @Washingtontimes
Awesome! Due diligence not a faded tenet of the American politic. Facts matter.
@LindseyGrahamSC  WGC= Wild Goose Chase
I think the senate should investigate Trump, wikileaks and Russian ties. We need those taxes too.
@katherinemiller Well, this is going to necessitate yet another distraction!  If I were in North Korea, I'd dig myself a hole.
Trump should show us his taxes and tie to Russia.  Donald Trump has been made an honorary Russian Cossack
@LindseyGrahamSC I would hope all of you demand him to publicly apologize if it doesn't exist #beyondexasperatedwithtrump
Could this be opening Pandora's Box?
Hey Lindsey, why don't you subpoena Trump's tax returns?! Did you give Trump your phone number so that you can collude with him?
Why did Trump and WiniLeaks expose our spy secrets? This will help ISIS and our enemy to plot more 9/11's. dumb
Look like a legal wiretap. Signed and dated. Nothing illegal.
Faux investigation. CIA must be held ACCOUNTABLE
Think he should have left that last paragraph out. May have people exiting left right front center
Trump should be investigated more with his ties to Russia and his taxes.
@LindseyGrahamSC why not just  ask the president for his evidence yesterday when you met with him?
@LindseyGrahamSC - thank you!!! Very serious and not a game.
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING FISHY WAS DONE OUTSIDE CONVENTIONAL CHANNELS???
How about they investigate something that ACTUALLY happened. #Trumprussia #TrumpTaxes
@LindseyGrahamSC too little too laye
On FISA: if identity of US national (e.g. Flynn) isn't masked, then it becomes indirect way of spying on US nat
I do believe @POTUS just signed a request for records that will lead to his #Impeachment.  Karma can be wonderful sometimes.
@LindseyGrahamSC Why R u doing this? I hope it's to humiliate cheeto face!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC You're just enabling his delusions. Professional psychiatrists would tell you to stop doing that.
@Graham you are not trustworthy..I hope your skeletons come falling out the closet
going to be interesting when they open this can of worms.
@MrsOpie88 maybe this will finally end the "fake tweets"
So appreciate your efforts to resolve this, knowing you have the ability and the tenacity.
I will be watching this closely
@LindseyGrahamSC so how did this end up with NBC?
@LindseyGrahamSC 
EXCELLENT! Let's get this party started and impeach Trump!
Lol you don't understand this at all
Ok now we are getting somewhere.
Well played, Sen Graham. Well played.
Lindsey's loving this. Can't wait for him to publish the response:  "There were no warrants issued."
and what happens when they refute trumps claims? i hope you will be as public in putting out that information
@LindseyGrahamSC Be carefull Lindsey your lunch  meeting with Trump. Your R Making Enemys Liberals and & your boyfriend Mcain
you are wrong.  He is talking with the liberals.  Trump is in a corner.
@LindseyGrahamSC Oops!
@LindseyGrahamSC, did Donald ask you to do this during lunch yesterday? Don't give him info re Russia collusion investigation!
@katherinemiller didn't Grassley already ask for these on Monday?
@LindseyGrahamSC  THANK YOU for looking into this matter and begin the request for documents! PLEASE find out what is going on!!
@LindseyGrahamSC  I thought the WH was supposed to keep the FBI/DOJ at arms length and not interfere.
@LindseyGrahamSC Wish they would ask for #TaxReturns so we can finally show #IRGC and #Russian money laundering.
#Trumprussia
They wouldn't dare. But maybe  @LindseyGrahamSC is inclined to prove me wrong? Follow the money > find Russians.
anyone wanna talk odds on this backfiring on Donnie?
