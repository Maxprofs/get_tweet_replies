similar to spineless politicians flip-flopping on important issues #investigatetrump #ImpeachTrump
Impeach him for doing what he said he was going to instead of playing golf like Obama??
yeah becuz that's all PBO did...try educating urself on the issues at hand
I am educated on the issues..I am well aware of how Obama ruined our country!!
ok I'll bite, facts please! What did he do exactly to ruin this country--facts not rhetoric
Signed the ACA..made the Iran deal..gave $$ to Palestinians..shall I continue??
ACA has given ins to millions, EU did Iran deal & it was Irans $$ returned, Palestine is Humanitarian aid
People cant afford ACA! Kerry negotiated Iran Deal. Iran was emboldened..Congress said not to give $$ to Pale
@NAACP  so we ditch the ed department, get rid of the EPA, and promote racism and bigotry? You have been busy in 2017
Promote racism and bigotry? You must be talking about Dems..the party that started the KKK! #HYPOCRIT
are we sure this is real? Don't see anything online about it.  Seems like this:
@NAACP is this some "participation" trophy for attending this conference?
I am honestly curious. It may well be real, but it is worth asking the question.
these days, you've gotta ask
Unfortunately it's real (I don't understand how or why): http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/jeff-sessions-trump-attorney-general-senate-procedural-vote-234737 …
has @NAACP confirmed?
Good question, I assume the author verified it wasn't photoshoped before publishing
i think you should talk to Trump about you being the new  National Security Advisor, i dont agree with you 60% But trust U
Shut up Graham!  You voted for DeVos and have not credibility.
He did something right by voting for DeVos!! Now our kids will learn the truth!! #MAGA
Here is the list of @NAACP awards.  No "Governmental Award of Excellence" exists. @snopes @nytimes
Press release from Alabama NAACP says this award is likely fake: http://alnaacp.org/pressreleases/press_release_20170209_02.pdf …
FAKE NEWS
hmmm... they have no shame, just seeking to fan the hate and racial divide for political gain
You voted against my children when you voted for #DeVos, and now you expect Dems to play nice?
"voted against my children..." LOL.
Voted for the discontinuation of the teachers union supported liberal brain washing camps? Yes!
right it's the libs brainwashing, but you want a Christian fundamentalist who "want's to advance God's kingdom" to lead education
I'm an atheist & I don't care about her personal life but know that DeVos led an exemplary one fighting for freedom.
would love to hear about this 'exemplary life'..
If you actually knew anything more than what the #MSM says so you can parrot it to your friends... @wise_dvm
I don't watch that shit.. sounds like you don't know what you are talking about, nothing about DeVos is exemplary
ROTTEN PEOPLE HAVE NO PLACE AS CIVIL SERVENTS, WE CAN SUE YOUR BOND FOR BREACH OF DUTY WISE GUY.
NAACP gave no such award. National office and AL office say so. Please retract your statement and then apologize.
people change.
With all due respect Senator, isn't it time you stood up and asked the President to stop lying to us?When will you do that?
Your followers deserve better than fake news.
not real. #fakenews
Where'd you guys get the plaque made? Hobby Lobby?! #RESISTANCE #resist
Liberal media painting Sessions as a racist possibly because solely Trump nominated him.
what a beautiful participation trophy
I hope that he will fight for Human Rights now.  Doubtful in this sorry excuse for an administration.
U wanted Ted Cruz killed on the floor of the Senate & the 2 of U abdicated your responsibilities & voted 4 Devos & Sessions
as a constituent I am surprised that the Republicans couldn't coalesce around a less controversial nominee. Scared of POTUS
so... that's an award.  Can't do much harm with a plaque.  Now, AG?  He can do a lot of harm. Sarcasm is unbecoming
HEY FUKFACE, SESSIONS IS A KKK KLANSMAN...JUST LIKE U!! #WARRENROCKS #DRUMPFSUKS
you know this is wrong for US. I have long been your fan; now disappointed and disgusted. Do better.
The NAACP has denied ever giving Sessions this award. No such conference - it was "civil" not "civic." More lies. #FakeNews
I'll point out the validity of this is in question. If so, then good. He won't be as bad as feared. Otherwise.....
.@LindseyGrahamSC doesn't matter. He's  in #MAGA
-#Soros got to them!
One of the NWO legion 
He walks a crooked path
We were set on a straight path
We don't follow those who walk a crookedpath
@LaurieJasperNH If this is real, and he does his job, not the trump lackey job, the real one, I'll be the first to cheer
too late for you buddy. your career is over.
.@LindseyGrahamSC Please substantiate your claim with a report or article about this award. All I can find is a snopes article. Pls verify
HYPOCRITS OBSTRUCTIONISTS
You do know that's a fake award right?!
So the Democrat dog & pony show collapses again & their acolytes flail & vector off into a new outrage of the day.
@Chris_1791 Look at all the snowflakes who can't handle the fact Sessions was given an NAACP award. It's real. #notracist
Sen., I want to respect you, I really do. But it's always 1 step forward 2 steps back with you 
Did you forget to post Coretta King's letter denouncing Sessions?   Oh snap!   #Warren2020
YEAH followed by a big YAWN.   Because awards are so meaningful, NOT!  And Graham is devoid of credibility.   #Warren2020
Senator can you tell us how this award came into your possession? It would help us validate it. Thanks
Warren was shut up. Now U do the same thing. Lindsey Graham: Silencing Warren Was 'Long Overdue'
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-silencing-elizabeth-warren-long-overdue_us_589c42bce4b0c1284f2ac086?022y9izf7mm30daemi …
@HadassahStar1 ignorant little people
Every attack on Sen. Sessions was pure politics. He is a good Christian man- & overly qualified!
What Sen. Sessions was put through during confirmation, by fellow senators, was appalling & vile
@PositiveInt AND YOU OPPOSE OUR PRESIDENT AT EVERY STEP!!!!!
because he's a racist wish the ppl back in the day were voting. REASONS WHY THEY SAID NO BEFORE??
 Racism.
@scottisbell_ We don't care. And oh by the way the dempcratics have an open position are they getting you for it.
you should post truth a/b award. it's from state chapter. you should know we are going to fact check you people & your lies
Thanks for sharing @senwarren @SenSchumer
@NAACP corrupt, archaic, needs closing like @UN. Remedy this @LindseyGrahamSC, u may b voted back in2 office; " #Congress is on Notice."
@DaveNYviii  LG just doesn't know when to quit. Help is on the way once that arrest warrant is signed.
give me a break.  You are a lying, sad soul! #letlizspeak #ShePersisted #FactsMatter #NordstromRocks #alternativefacts
hope you realize that without Donald Trump, there would be know need to make this argument.
@dhiggins63 The Left...truth be damned! Gonna lie like hell 2 cater 2 our uneducated constituents! Hypocrisy personified!
Looks like a man of Alabama.
this is all so disturbing and costly towards our country morally and monetarily I pray Sen Sessions helps right the wrongs
@angiekay500 busted
Mr. Graham, you make me ashamed to be an American.
That's the problem with Dems manipulation of their identity politics. @realDonaldTrump is no better as a baby adult also.
@MelissaTweets Same kind of hypocrisy as Sen. Booker.
NAACP = hypocrites. Congrats to our new attorney general!
the just shows how corrupt the @NAACP is! they are racist!
If this is real, big IF, then they got bought off and are just like you and the "so-called" Republican Party.
they look like HYPOCRITES!  LOTS OF FIGHTS AHEAD!  YOU NEED TO BACK TRUMP SENATOR!
@ACLU This is true, right?
LIBERAL HYPOCRISY KILLS AMERICANS!
Democrats fear an honest AG like Sessions who will follow Constitution, enforces the laws, prosecute corrupt politicians.
Everybody is a racist until you prove them wrong @NAACP @SenWarren
I once received a 2nd place trophy, not because I was fast or finished, but because I paid an entrance fee & showed up.
we will remember every vote for bigotry. This will not be forgotten
@DebAlwaystrump go away Lindsay Graham.  U are annoying
This is how Left promotes racism and division in America
#cnn #msnbc #foxnews #demexit #maga
@OutFrontCNN
voters will respond
A picture is worth 1,000 words. Thanks for posting this!
this is fake. #letlizspeak #fakenews
When Sessions gets to the DOJ I wonder how many computers he'll find have been bleach bitted? Libs stalling for a reason!
Better be careful, Snopes is gonna bite you in the ass on this one and you'll look like Kellyanne Con Job @KellyannePolls
I respect you. you are a patriot. don't agree with u much butadmire your intellect#beingblackandrepublicanainteasy
Aren't you sorry you voted to approve Kagam and Sotomayor now?
#SessionsFakeAward given out at #BowlingGreen
you and McCain are part of this problem, Lindsey. You enable these Democrats by attacking President Trump.
@Timtravels007 Lindsey I got this.  We all know the hearings are a sham and all u bitches will confirm anything I do.
The National Anti American Communist Pogrom.
pointless award to flatter ego is different from actual power. You should know  - you speak one way and vote another.
partisan Hypocrisy
.@LindseyGrahamSC @whignewtons >Who said appeasing racists and being stupid was limited? Come to think of it Huck...
Methinks the NAACP is bi-polar and should be admitted for observation to the nearest psychiatric hospital.
@RichardGrenell NAACP are now a racist organization political hacks
Liz take note
@RichardGrenell Democrats always play "race card!" Many in DC that have worked with Sessions now oppose him! Deplorable!
sign of the times...sad and pathetic.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @whignewtons Kinda like how you opposed Merrick but now want Gorsuch treated fairly.  #SCOTUS #MerrickGarland
CORRECTION: Opposed PBO.
@whignewtons sorry, u lost all cred by voting yes on DeVos. Traitor to our kids futures
#hypocrisy lives on in DC!
money talks, dnc proved beyond any shadow of doubt during campaigns, they paid naacp to flip.
@RichardGrenell Hippocrates!!
King would endorse Sessions’ record for having worked to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan and desegregate public schools.
it has gone beyond ridiculousness!
ONE OF THOSE "ALTERNATIVE FACTS"?
@RichardTBurnett Are you surprised I'm not.  They are two faced and they don't have a clue about how to help anyone.
@AdamBaldwin But, but, but...........Coretta Scott King said he was a bum. #ConfirmSessions
@PJStrikeForce @LindseyGrahamSC @AdamBaldwin  Time for Dems to try to unite
Congrats, you made it onto Snopes
Some folks never let the facts get in the way of their arguments.
Odd for RINO @LindseyGrahamSC to support anyone but Dems - I'm for Sessions not you!
@Debsam1760 Politics Politics
@AdamBaldwin are you shocked? There is no intellectual honesty anymore. He will get bid, they will lose, they will cry.
@AdamBaldwin let's not forget any "fake" awards as well
I have to say, @LindseyGrahamSC has been killing it lately. 

@AdamBaldwin
@AdamBaldwin who listens to the NAACP anymore?
NAACP is way past its prime, to the point they stink nowadays. No longer relevant, no longer needed.
@KimStrassel   Politics. Plain and simple.
Ideology & Hypocrisy are thicker than t/truth when it comes to progressive liars. #tcot .@LindseyGrahamSC @davis1087
The NAACP now opposes Sen. Jeff Sessions.....though in 2009 they honored him with their Governmental Award of Excellence. #ConfirmSessions 
I would have displayed it at the confirmation hearings.
@NAACP No record of this can be found only. Was this awarded to @jeffsessions? Is this even real?
Politics!!!   Frustrating!!!
The NAACP will ride both sides of a fence if given the chance. don't give them the chance! They ARE irrelevant these days.
Democrats can go to Hell, all of them, they should be locked out
Squirrel Nut Zippers had a song - Put a lid on it. Lefties should take it as an anthem.
if you need a bluegrass band, I am in Clover SC who leads The Briarhoppers, the longest-lived band in the US.  #SupportSC!
@MyPresidentme just go away Lindsey...u r hurting the GOP & America

...this sounds a'lot like the Cory Booker "stupidity"award, honoring Sen Sessions one week&condemning the next
...NAACP award for the "Excellence Award" for the "Outstanding Work You Do"...talk about mud on your face!!!
SHAME ON YOU for sharing this FAKE claim. There was no such event, and Session's 2009 calendar/website had no awards #FACTS
@KimStrassel Shocking hypocrisy. Could it be political?
@gabrielmalor There is no explaining politics!  He's a good man, confirm him!
@jimgeraghty   What a snobbish self serv'g bunch to pass or take always halo's...loved kkk Sen R Byrd, Sen Gore & kkk party
@gabrielmalor
Wouldn't normally RT a warmongering chicken like LG, but he makes a good point here.
@jimgeraghty Just confirm him already!
confirm Jeff, and join the Trump train. Make peace with russia. We don't want war
So why are you reporting this Mr Graham? Are you ready to get on the TRUMP TRAIN and MAGA?
You do understand that a SENATOR is held to a different standard of fitness than and ATTORNEY GENERAL.

False narrative.
@bennyjohnson Yeah yeah, and we were once allied with Australia
what did Sessions do to prompt that award then, and how much different is it from his record related to becoming Atny Genl?
NAACP code for racist bigoted blacks who hate white people.
What a joke!
Nevertheless she persisted.
oh the snowflakes!
We are not fooled. We see what Repubs are doing and we vote. @Indivisible_OR
@NAACP Is this REAL?
PHOTOSHOP!
NAACP is KKK but on gov. Payroll.
It is what it is!
FAKE NEWS. You all are now spreading news that is fake. Call the AL NAACP. See if they actually gave this award. WRONG.
Can  you provide details about this award?  I was unable to find any information about this convention or the award.
@africanmob1 You won't hear lamestream news reporting this. Reverse racists who happen to be White. Hypocrites.
no one " honors him" unless they are wealthy & white 
@InChargeable1 
More Liberal Lunacy 
yes now focus on that instead of trying to take out Mr. Trump! Fkn John too!
WRONG! #fakenews
there's no proof of this no record !  RT and show a blatant lie from both graham and @SenatorSessions !!!! @SenSanders
@SenatorSessions  this is NOT REAL. The award was never given.  you MUST post the truth. WE WILL MAKE THE LIE KNOWN
Maybe @SenWarren Should mention this?
Why didn't you have the courage to step up and allow Senator Warren to continue? Why did you choose cowardly silence?
Do not attempt to justify his character as you prepare to vote. You can chose to be on the right side of history or not.
@davis1087 a request to all you GOP Senators please help our President have hos cabinet in place. Unite and get it done
yeah...but that was then
I just called the @NAACP and they said they have never had a "Governmental Award of Excellence."  Why do you believe this?
I'm sorry senator Graham, but I think you've been duped.  NAACP has always opposed Sessions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sessions …
I can't find anyway, this statement of NAACP award...anywhere...
