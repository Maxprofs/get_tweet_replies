Also, #factcheck, the ACA was not negotiated behind closed doors. #ShowUsTheBill
do you have the source for that chart? Trying to find it, but have been unsuccessful so far. Thanks!
I was waiting for 1 of U hatefilled "Christian" Conservative Republicans to start throwing out the "fake" explanation 4 anything u dont like
We know that but we have no real men in power anymore! Law enforcement I am related to want Trump out too! Rigged Election no winner #ReVote
Who twisted Pence arm to tweet that?? I know he's just thinking he will take over after Trump Impeachment! Go away Pence!! All of you!
It's a tweet from 2010. He was complaining about the Democrats.
IT'S REPUBLICARE. NOT TRUMPCARE. STOP USING A MISNOMER, REPUBLICANS ARE RESPONSIBLE, TRUMP IS TOO STUPID TO HAVE EVEN CRAFTED THIS.
Throw the f##ckers OUT  !!! WHAT are you all waiting for?
January of 2010.
The hypocrisy of The VP is astounding. A pious man with no moral compass.  Shame on Pence.
What are you doing for ppl with no choice or no insurance company to choose from?? That needs help NOW!
Dangerous,  and Cruel! Why not just Fix Obama care! Im glad that trump spoke out about this bill not be "mean" &having""- did they listen?
I completely agree with Pence that it's wrong for such behavior. Appreciate you all correctly the issue.
@gbollmann01 @VP @SenateGOP I LOVE a good ole blast from the past Tweet. HYPOCRISY !!!
This is the first sensible thing Pence has said.
Pence, just another self serving hypocrite GOP politician. No ethics. No respect for the office or others.
#Trumpcare #ShowUsTheBill Me: "WHOA I actually agree with him on something!" ∗notices date∗ "Oh."
Uh, no. For one, Obamacare was not done behind closed doors nor excluded the other side.
To Republicans and Democrats either work together or i'm afraid that country will see a resistance that's never been seen before & should
duh  well shut my mouth, did he say that, nahh not him
They are working for us. Why can't me know what they're doing.  They're ashamed. --Hard to believe because that would require a conscience.
@VP WAS right as Gov. He no longer believes his own words. Stories often change when one goes from no power to control. 
Dems chose to not participate via Shumer back in February and again in August; too late now! #MAGA
I guess we'll get to see #Trumpcare when the IRS finishes Trump's audit?
#MikePenceAntiLGBT (Wouldn't you love to see the skeletons in his closet?)

Yes Mikey what about that transparency????
Equally worse that NO women were involved w shaping a bill that will affect the majority of our population!! #unforgiveable #women #AHCA
He may be saying this but don't think 4 1 min that he really doesn't support the Hurry Up & Die Act.
U were ok with it then, why not now?  Seems like the GOP learned from the Dems on how to do healthcare!
It's the #TrumpCareCut

Cut care for 24 Million Americans in exchange for a tax cut for the rich.
He's a self-serving lying POS of the worst kind, betraying us all, betraying the Constitution he swore to uphold. How can he live w himself?
Preach @VP!! Come on @SenateGOP, listen to your vice president!
......unless we're doing the negotiating.  Actually the correct word is plotting. You're welcome!

#RUSSIAFLFUNDS #MOBTIES #BAYROCK #FELEXSTATER #TRUMPIMPEACHMENT: Obstruction, Dereliction of duty, Money Laundering. Trump will go to jail. 
@SweetCheeses11 @VP @SenateGOP Senator Wyden you doing a great work for America does the GOP care about us
Evil Republicans!!!!
He meant Democratic legislation.  Remember the R next to you name allows any and all hypocrisy without repercussions.
Maybe Russia isn't done writing the bill yet...
Mike Pence words in 2010 ..about closed doors negotiations<
OMG--the @VP is right!! #resist
But that's only what #Pence thought in 2010. Now he serves a different master.
Use their old curses against them. They define hypocrite.

Republican hypocrisy.  So very delicious. #ShowUsTheBill #Trumpcare #Resist #TheResistance #WednesdayWisdom
Dear GOP, Pence says that what crafting a healthcare bill behind closed doors is wrong! Isn’t that right Mikey? @GOP @DNC @VP
And yet Pence is as thick as thieves with this. They are sheep. One follows the ass of the others and just go in a circle. Nothing positive
# Rep turn out to be worse than what they were accusing Obama of; it's a shame.
Such as Trumpcare?
ACA had lots of GOP input but then they wouldn't vote for ACA taxes, etc.
Since when have GOP stopped being hypocrites?
I agree this is wrong, but (apparently) the public doesn't care.  Nary a protester in sight on Capitol Hill this week.
I heard there will be a change by the Senate to require everyone over the age of 18 to have a complete STD test? Is that true? 
Action speaks louder than words.  Pence doesnt have a word, no integrity, no honor, no justice, no peace.  #Corruption in GOP GOVT
It was a metaphor to get elected, anyone who trusted the neo con party promises were duped as being not smart enough to vote in modern era
It's interesting how Vice President Pence seems to disagree with the sentiment of Governor Pence. What could have changed his mind?
*COUGH BUT SCREAMS ANYWAY* 
SHAMLESS!!!!!
*cough cough*
We'll show u our bill if U had shown us ur bill....U didn't & U put it thru against ppl's desire...how abt shutting up
shame he was talking about the dems tho. such a fucken hypocrite.
Thing Is About Stupid People' They Don't Remember What Side Of The Argument They Were On ! ! !
Hypocrisy is a republican brand.
Pandering BS. Ask him to urge people to vote against it.
Doesn't matter. ACA was crap, new plan will be crap & any new Dem involved plan would be crap. They never address why healthcare is so high
Didn't we hear something similar to Pence's tweet from every damn Repub during ACA? And there were hearings, amendments, etc. Hypocrites!
@brandcoachkelly @VP Hypocrite @SenateGOP
Ha, I guess you don't like it when happens to you? Honestly, the ACA has been great for me.
But @R1506 the #ACA wasn't really negotiated behind closed doors. It had188 GOP amendments accepted, 77 hearings. How many for #Trumpcare?
Doesnt matter.. Democrats have decided to not vote....
Shut up Pence your involved in the Russian scandals!
2 faced
So guessing we'll be seeing your apology for doing it with Ocare?
Wrong? It's criminal! #Repugs  #StopThePunk #GreedyOldPunks
We still haven't seen the two thousand pages of Obamacare.

'At just 8 years old, she is the strongest human being I know' — this mother wants to protect her daughter from Trumpcare 
Power changes people
Tweets ought to be called "inconvenient memories"
#showusthebill. You only hide when you know it's wrong.
Crooks and liars. He looks you in the eyes and lies.
some Americans should shut up! e.g. #Trump
Remember Obamacare Nancy P. Said we must pass it the read it to see what's in it. How everyone forgot #doublestandard
That was 7 years ago. Now Pence couldn't care less or doesn't have the backbone to speak out against the secrecy.
.@VP Hypocrite
ooops that was meant for Pence!
@VP so how much did you get to change your statement?
how many GOP amendments were made to OBAMACARE (s) ? and who authored them? Speak the truth if possible ***
Proof power corrupts. When he was just a Governor he had some margin of ability to know right from wrong 
AMEN!!!!!

#MikePencesNuts
#MikePenceGayTreeAttack (Mike Pence was a terror in Indiana politics. He was and still is very Anti-LGBT
#PsychoMikePence
To have a crazy suit backed up by an empty suit and so on doesn't leave a lot to hope for in the near term
Wow, Pence has started campaigning already!
@aravosis @VP @SenateGOP Thank you Mr.Pence!  I coul
If it affects all people it should be done in the open, not behind close doors !!!! Is there some Hanky Panky ????
Oh boy, Mr. Pence, how does Mr. President feel about this??
Are there any Republicans whose tweets aren't coming back to bite them?
When Pence tweets something so democratic, I begin to think him & Trump r up 2 no damn good.
When did he say this?
Did you throw up a little when you said that 
Too bad he didn't say it about this current bill.
Wow, that surprises me that he might care...
I'd RT but I don't want his face on my page ever....#GOP #HealthcareBill
@DisTrumpia @VP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr
It was wrong (if you were telling the entire truth) back then and it's wrong in 2017! Why is GOP being so secretive?
His former self was right. His current hypocritical self is a PoS!
Then, @VP, if it comes to it, you must vote NO! #ShowUsTheBill
He said that in 2010!
Thanks @RonWyden 
Oh, I get it #HCR is actually HYPOCRISY!
Well then, put a stop to all the secrecy. No, you are just good for coming in for a tiebreaker to screw the American people...Please!
is it safe to say all politicians are hypocrites cause i feel like all the time when the shoe is on the other foot both sides have amnesia.
Normally, you're right. But, the secretive nature of the AHCA and the year long process for ACA are completely different.
If the @SenateGOP do not have anything to hide from the American people, why they do not do it on the open? @washingtonpost #ShowUsTheBill
Pence is in one hand and in the other.
Sad that this is probably from the days when they were working on the ACA. He certainly isn't saying that now!! Ryan et am are his buddies
for once something I can agree with Pence on
Am I reading this correctly? The VP is criticizing the GOP and the great McConnell - well I never!!!

Pence, as a Catholic, doesn't have to worry about his soul.  He doesn't have one!
Thanks Senator Wyden. Let's stop this tax cut bill!
OMEN...
I am fine with the *initial proposal* being drafted by a small grp
w time for *all* to read,internalize,modify before voting
#ShowUsTheBill
Funny, when you suddenly don't get invited to the party , you finally decide to care!
What is good for the goose is good for the gander. You losers in the democrap party started this secretive process. @realDonaldTrump
What sort of tin pot dictatorship would hide legislation in this manner? Oh, right.
Why are they hiding behind closed doors The Senate and the people have a right to know how they are screwing us
But ur in on it!!
they control Congress so they can do whatever they want at their peril
Was 52 times telling these men "no" not enough? #nomeansno #GOPHypocrisy #HealthcareBill #ShowUp #ShowUsTheBill #doyourjob #notnormal
Get the govt out of healthcare. Repeal Obamacare and let the free market replace it.
SHOW US THE BILL. We can read! Also, whether you show us or not, people will die and you'll look like jerks. #ShowUsTheBill #GOPHypocrisy
He's only sucking up with that statement. Hopes hiding his Russian ties won't disqualify him for presidency after trump impeachment.
Stop your damn whining. They have every RIGHT to get it RIGHT THIS TIME. They do not need the left and their crap.
Dang. @VP has really porked out.
He looked good back then, but dude's got neck fat now.
And yet now he's silent, why, because he's party over country, that's why
your silence defines and condemns you
Why retweet message condemning Obamacare being shoved down our throats to support position that the AHCA is following same path? No sense
I agree! #ShowUsTheBill
How are they going to deal with the extra violence from people being off their meds when #AHCA won't cover them or they can't afford it?
My child's life in danger with #Trumpcare
.@Nataliew1020 the Agenda: reduce debt, balance budget, increase WMD, enable euthanasia & refuse Planned Parenthood, increase  hypocrisy 
Amazing how he appears to be positioning himself for the takeover isn't it? cc @maddow
GREAT TWEET!!!!
The GOP is very good at giving advices but never apply its own's words when in charge.
Feel like a #Hypocrit yet @MikePenceVP? This is exactly what @HouseGOP is doing now! @WhiteHouse @POTUS  @PaulRyanSpeaker @SenateMajLdr

#LicTrump: Trump awol. Trump tax records M.I.A. Trump & Sessions Russia collusion memories K.I.A. Republican Party L.I.A.R.S. "Go figure!" 
That's what happens when you make a statement from a high moral horse, later someone tramples you with your own morality (and horse). 
Our Good Friend, Paul Wellstone died for our sins Ron & you all let Clapper spit in your faces & go on with the plan; you're ALL cowards!
But ya did it anyway, didn't ya
Somebody thinks the Russia thing will leave him last man standing..
Hmmm.  So what is Pence DOING about it?  All Twitter talk, no action?
Yes tweet from 2010. Don't like it do you? Too bad
Ron Wyden is so self important!! Blah blah blah
I can't stand it when he talks. He is so condescending and accusatory!
Creepy, for sure!
But your president will sign it anyway because he's just another meat puppet
@GeorgeTakei @VP @SenateGOP The hypocrisy is astounding.
lol words coming back to mock you!
Apparently. The new twitter handle = new ideals
From 7 years ago now its different!
Yes, @SenateGOP. The bill affects all Americans and we deserve to know how our lives will change--from jobs lost to more expensive care.
Because they just want to stick it toTRUMP 
Democrats do not can for the Amercians peoples .
Everyone over 50 will get an automatic premium increase of 67%. Before any preexisting condition charges and cut Medicaid. Do the math!!
Sen Heller in NV office just told me he is opposed to Senate bill keep calling all Senators
#Trumpcare #ShowUsTheBill #HoldTheFloor
Democrats need 2 stop with stupidity..!!
Get this trending#TheResistance
Why the hell are you Senate? Why not look into Clinton and Obama  all your crooks  friends all
Of you need to retire..!!!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP
What a difference a political makes.  What's good for the goose
So, he won't be that tiebreaker vote! I'll wait.
I'm incredible uncomfortable with the notion that I agree with Mike Pence on anything.  #ShowUsTheBill
He needs to speak out and louder. The GOP is deaf!
Sure we demand to the Know this secret speedy deathcare Bill
Vote a rama..grind this to a halt make them go home and face constituents
That was then.  This is now.
I'm calling on all parties to sit down and negotiate a health care bill we can all live with. This partisan politics has gone on to long.
