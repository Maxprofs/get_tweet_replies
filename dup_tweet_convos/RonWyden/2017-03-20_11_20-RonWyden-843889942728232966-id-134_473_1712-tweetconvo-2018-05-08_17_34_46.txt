This is why open hearings matter. And they should happen regularly.
Please ask for full disclosure of Trump's collusion with Russia & call for impeachment as necessary.
Bwahahaha you're FUNNY 
@SenSchumer 

Until Democrats explain how Gen'l Flynn's name was unmasked w/o using surveillance, I'm tired of Dems claim.
But he will keep saying he was....Delusional !  #fakepresiident  We will never believe him!  #impeachment
Its irrefutable that he was surveilled. They have the conversations and leaked them. https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/839247138269839360 …  @SenSchumer

there will be no impeachment, he's done nothing wrong. Did you listen to the hearing? Zero evidence 
The Beltway Blindspot. All D.C. is fixated on hearings about Russians & the election. Back home we could care less. We care about tax reform 
@GetBZLiving perhaps Trump meant cock-whipped & mistakenly said 'Obama', instead of 'Putin'. He is confused, afterall.
they never said not influenced  only NOT AT BALLOT BOX.  THEY NEVER INVESTIGATED IF IT INFULENCED ELECTION
ALL involved in almost 1 yr investigation that have spoken sd no evidence. Proven Law broken re citizen identity leaked.
they didn't investigate effects on election.  They haven't mentioned Trumps loans from Russia and China
And shouldn't be about leaks but fact this country was attacked by a foreign country to which #45 and/our his team was in contact
@SenSchumer if your an Obama appointee I'm thinking you have a loyalty. Instead of investigating in bias recuse yourself.
@SenSchumer it will be proven that he was.  He has the evidence and was waiting for comey to finish investigation.
yeah like he waited to release proof for all his other lies
just wait and you will see.
@SenSchumer NOTE HOW LYING RON AND CHUCKY PUT QUOTES AROUND "WIRETAPPED". WONDER WHAT THEY KNOW?
Time to apologize.
yes he was, the same guy who gave billions of dollars to our enemy wiretapped President Trump!
Esacltly Ronnie. Wiretap is a coloquilaism for surveillance, and YOUR side surveilled Donald Trump!
Because CRIMES were committed by members of Barack  Insane Obamas administration.
Yes, Ron, and were able to get the facts out-a timeline if you will. So necessary because GOP only interested in jailing reporters
So when is he going to get kicked out of the White House?!!
He's not going anywhere; zero evidence of any wrongdoing. When are the leakers going to jail? That is the question. #CoverUp
you NEED to ASK ABOUT THE SALE OF URANIUM AND THE "lost" emails " we SEE THE COLLUSION FROM demo RATS AND cheap labor 
Of course not!  Everyone but the Dictator knew it.
NOPE all it does is open more questiuons like who & HOW the leaks occured. SOmeone did it& THAT is surveillence
@SenSchumer No, we got an explanation of legal process 4 surveillance, but not 4 actual illegal surveillance &  unmasking & leaks.
@SenSchumer The last 8 years have been abuse of power Dems.  Using Gov entities to push an agenda or to silence opposers
@SenSchumer What's worse? Lying to the ppl to save your marriage or lying to the ppl to hide your involvement with our enemy?
lying videos lying about Benghazi didn't care much then did ya
Parsing words. He was surveilled. The leaked convos are proof. The leaking is the crime & all Americans should be outraged.
Who knows? could be Comey himself or any of his cohorts that Obama opened up classified info to who did the leaking.
@SenSchumer How did 2 phone calls get reported on if no 1 listening?Lots of lies coming from Leftists!Comey hides behind position!
@SenSchumer HOW can Americans or others believe anything he says?? He is not ready or able to lead the American people- impeach!
@SenSchumer President lies and nothing we can do about it! That pisses me off!
that was not established. He sd no evidence yet but still investigating. Just started investigating it. Ur misleading
yes he was.. but you would all rather believe in Russian collusion than the idea that Obama could have gone to outside operatives
Comey played around with words...Trump was absolutely spied on, one way or another
@SenSchumer what proof did they offer for your claim?  None. Same proof they had for Russia claims.
they have proof of Russian claims and I HEARD TRUMP ASK THEM TO INTERFERE ON NATIONAL TV
"proof of Russian claims". A claim is not proof, it's a belief. Also, lol on the last part.
@SenSchumer I cant believe you actually believed anything Trump says!! I guess it takes one to know one..shows how unreliable u r.
correct as to legal wiretaps.  Nothing said about illegal wiretaps without a FISA warrant
#blogofodin
yeah from Trumps Russian friends
.@RonWyden @SenSchumer That is still under investigation, what we do know is that there was no collusion between Trump Campaign and Russia.
the head spook debunked that lie and said THAT THEY NEVER SAID THAT IT IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.
@SenSchumer Our first evidence that he wasn't wiretapped was that he said he was. 

The man is a habitual liar. More of the same.
or any other govt agency meaning those ' acting under color of law '
@SenSchumer then why all the reporting from the media to the contrary? Spreading a false narrative perhaps?
then condemn Hilary too
@SenSchumer not hardly and remember he who laughs last laughs best we the truth Sears or waiting to laugh last
@SenSchumer Duh??
What a waste of taxpayer $. 45 should be fined or better yet impeached.
@SenSchumer bullshit Having liars like Comey testify means jackshit. Libs should know better. Remember Hillary #LockHerUp
I gaurntee you Trump will be locked up first
Kind of anticlimactic isn't it?
not at all.  It still builds
@SenSchumer I not so fast
LOL what a fool you are
Well that's good.  Neither did they help him win the election.
yes they did
@SenSchumer if FBI investigating collusion since July, doesn't that place at least part of Trump's campaign under surveillance?
Trump and others were investigated for contact with Russia but not wiretapped, as had been requested by Obama's DOJ?
Say more - what else did you learn from testimony and what comes next?
@SenSchumer so you say, as you hold Americans hostage instead of working for us. SMH
and there's zero evidence that @POTUS colluded #ComeyHearing & #Comey refused to ans re #Obama in the know #corruptdem
You are insignificant #Snowflake Will quit crying and go change your diaper!
just like Killary did no wrongdoing. Smh...

So the Secret Service found no illegal surveillance equipment while sweeping the trump property's. You know this for a fact?
Nice use of the word "wire tapped". Does not exclude other surveillance tho. Why would NYT report it happened?
maybe his Russian friends wiretapped him
.@RonWyden Does that mean, some criminal charges against POTUS are coming?
Senator, is there no cost to Trump for his doing this to the country, to President @BarackObama ?
@SenSchumer slow down
@SenSchumer yes keep the hearings public. We have to get 2 ottom of the Russian hacking if we're ever to trust any future election
can you explain to us about Project Dragnet & Project Sidewinder? I'm confused & it seems illegal govt. spying?
what he said was that as to "tweet" where @realDonaldTrump said Obama no evidence. He did not say NO ONE EVER!!!
@GCardiacsurgeon   He may not have been wire tapped but I guarantee he was probed. Many times probed. He walks around waiting
Really? Because he didn't say, it didn't happen? You are foolish!
It most certainly has NOT cleared that up @SenSchumer......do u think of ur lies before stating them or do they just come naturally?
@pmaddogs yes, there's NO evidence. Trump is knocked out !
@SenSchumer what proof ?I heard no proof.
Dir. Comey never said he wasn't wiretapped, all he said was that there was no evidence that BHO ordered him to be or was involved
Don't you have bigger fish to fry? Obama wiretapped plenty of people. He incinerated a lot too. So what if Trump has a big mouth?
Comey didn't say Trump wasn't wiretapped.
Comey didn't say Trump wasn't wiretapped.
Trump made a mistake. He read New York Times: "Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides" 01/20/2017 slimes since changed it
get hard evidence on everyone in this administration who was and is involved in treasonous acts against Americans.
@SenSchumer fake news im sure it happened  just like brazil n wassrmen shultz
do NOT stop pushing on this senator.
@SenSchumer wrong, what was stated was Comey didn't have evidence, "plausible deniability" he couldn't deny briefing Obama on them
cocaine abuse is known to cause paranoia.
Russia changed the election via @twitter accounts aimed at vulnerable citizens. #cyberwar #hybridwar
Why wasn't #DonaldTrump “wiretapped.”?
When ever-one else in the World is?
We will see. Trump was elected and he is president. Get over it.
@SenSchumer they also cleared up there's NO evidence of RUSSIA/TRUMP collusion why do you keep leaving off that part?????
Are there two different meeting happening - one for looking into the real menace of Russian influence? And the other on leaks?
yes
No one believed it, but MSM was, of course, deflected from real things, like taxes, emolument violations. @CNN @MSNBC
DONT FORGET comey said he was shaking his head at all the fake news from the NYT and Washington Post
Why is this hearing still going on This hearing has begun to answer the questions. Trump as not "wiretapped."
RIGHT! And BHO wasn't a Traitorous Lawless POTUS!!!
more like Lawless, clueless ObombUS
Not really.
@SenSchumer it's only first day of the hearing
How much did all of that cost, exactly? Asking for a taxpayer who's concerned about severe budget cuts in virtually all programs.
Pressure should be put on 45 to apologize....and not the fake mia culpa he did with birther issue.
Trump lied.  The question is, what will Congress do about it?
These people are seriously crazy. I cannot find any other explanation. Impeach! Derp! SMDH.
@SenSchumer Tell that to The NY Times and CNN they reported the wiretaps 1st
I tend to agree but all is not done.
@SenSchumer Not really.  Comey all but admitted Obama admin submitted FISA request to do so. Wouldn't say if it was denied.
TRUMP LIED . NUFF SAID .
@SenSchumer Wow. You guys believe things just because they "happened" in our "world"
@SenSchumer not an accurate quote. Also made it clear leaking classified info is a phelony
we need more info at Roger Stone.
knowledge of Russia and communication and so forth.
Okay. We are finished here. No wire tap. Did I spell that right? Moving on now. Russia and taxes and I believe the"CabinetMembers"
but was he "microwaved?"
lmao on the floor!
