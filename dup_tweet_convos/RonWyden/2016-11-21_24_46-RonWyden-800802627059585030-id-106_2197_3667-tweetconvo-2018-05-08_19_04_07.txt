From Sen Ron Wyden: a bill to require candidates for president to file w FEC their 3 most recent tax returns. https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2979 …
If Congress doesn’t pass this bill before inauguration, I will reintroduce next year written to apply to the President.
This is imperative because Trump is the first president-elect since Watergate to refuse to release tax returns.
Because of this the public knows next to nothing about Trump's investments & potential conflicts of interest.
...who cares? Did you require the Clinton Foundation to disclose all information about their donors during the election? Old news.
didn't have to. Clinton Fdn already releases all contrib and tax info every year. One of most scrutinized; high grades.
The media didn't worry until..well, they never worried, but people never made a big deal out of it until @wikileaks ?
And wikileaks has pointed out what, exactly? Nothing. Played up by the media to infer criminal activity. Was NONE.
Seriously? You think those @wikileaks docs showed nothing? Wow...ehh...agree to disagree on that one.
@davidfrum Have you considered adding disclosure for business interest where the are a majority owner or NPO Officer?
@davidfrum why not all tax returns from all years filed, 3 years is not enough
@rachelamonahan @davidfrum Show us yours. You think your so innocent. Where's your home? New York?
mine = formerly NYC
worth noting your bill isn't a law and most likely wont be. #draintheswap
But, is that a good thing or a bad thing? The business interests of a Politician should be transparent. #Trust   @RonWyden
I think i speak for the majority of America on some senator seeing my tax return  because I run for office  Bite Me!
Huh? Didn't understand that, at all..  @RonWyden
oh I think I made myself perfectly clear
So, you don't care if someone making decisions that affect YOU is doing it -not for your benefit, but his own? Mmmm
I stated pretty clearly what I thought about tax returns. End
Which made no sense. @RonWyden
@davidfrum Trump has had a free pass to do whatever he wants along with his family. Can't see him complying
@neeratanden hell yes
3 years at least!!!!
@davidfrum 
Thank you. Too bad it isn't retroactive.
Thank you Sen. Wyden!
@EileenLeft @davidfrum   Pssst, GOP congress.  Nothing will be done.
@davidfrum How about Requiring Them to Have a Psyche Evaluation?
This Should be The First Requirement and Then Reveal Their Taxes!
@Alasscan_ @davidfrum Question, can this be done on state level too as pre-req for ballot access (like, say, signatures)?
@davidfrum have you told him? Based on today's comments he's above all y'all and your silly bills/laws
@davidfrum Individuals' returns  (Dems or GOP) are NOT public documents.  Let the IRS make the call on bogus returns.
@Honey17011 @davidfrum That's my Sen Wyden, always late to the party!
Worth noting he could do it voluntarily even without the bill.
If sane Senators WANT to heal the division in this country, standing up to Trump on some issues by @SenateGOP will go a LONG way.
Congress needs to so as to restore faith...
@davidfrum And why would  GOP not support? Also needs to make POTUS/VP subject to ethics law that apply to Congress.
@davidfrum a bit worried we won't make it to next election...
@davidfrum How can we help you get this passed? We're organized & ready here in CA.
thanks you!!!!!
@PoliticalKel @davidfrum Pass it in the lame duck. Essential. Need to find 5 Rs who will stand for the country.
.@RonWyden @mulderc @davidfrum nice effort, but isn’t part of the issue that he’d have to not veto it?
lame duck session
.@mulderc @RonWyden @davidfrum ok, that works for me.   
everyone in this country has a conflict of interest.
@terriah01 @davidfrum bill or law?
I voted for you. 
@davidfrum 
Yes, yes, YES!!!!
@davidfrum you supported a president for 8 years that could not provide a birth certificate
Yeah? How? Article I §9 does have words about ex post facto laws. His nomination IS in the past...
@ritholtz @davidfrum Can you have this apply to Speaker Madigan in IL too? @John_Kass
Can we have them drug tested and get full psych. exams as a job requirement??
Thank you. Trust requires transparency. Leaders are accountable to the people.
this is great. If it ever gets out of committee...
@JohnJHarwood @davidfrum Tack on college transcripts while you are at it.  SMH
@davidfrum everyone needs to support this!
@ImpactDemocracy @davidfrum GOP will defeat it again!
@JohnJHarwood @davidfrum then press it!
at this point could it come up for a vote?
@unclesahm he would veto
why bother when a Charlatan rides into power on stupid and lies
.@RonWyden @ritholtz @davidfrum Trump needs to liquidate everything. Because of shell companies, much will remain opaque from tax returns.
@davidfrum what bill passes and Trump still won't release his taxes?
@neeratanden @davidfrum How to get it through?
@davidfrum Will that go for the president elect?
@davidfrum pshhh I voted for Johnson. Of course I care about either former candidates alleged corruption equally GJ ron.  Ladyvet
@Amy_Siskind @davidfrum Hope Clinton Cash gets their IRS investigation finished Soon! 
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum well this bill isn t going anywhere
@davidfrum time to show those taxes djt an Paul Ryan an mitch
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum good luck with that silliness. Complete waste of time.
how aren't more dem reps attacking the MYRIAD conflicts of interest? Thank you for your efforts, but let's get stronger as a party
Ron Wyden continues to represent All of Us Oregonians and our nation proudly.Trump's business + Gov. is a huge problem
Thank you for putting this together.
What is the penalty for non-compliance?
@OurRevolution @TheDemocrats Want ppl to act? Follow your tweets with links to how ppl can find and call their reps.
Thank you for doing this, Senator. We need everyone to hold him accountable. Your voice is invaluable.  @RonWyden @davidfrum
@ChipRolley @davidfrum why r RW Americans not happy about forcing @realDonaldTrump to release his #taxreturns?
@davidfrum I get it, but he'd have you dining in GTMO before he followed a law he didn't like.
Good Luck pretending Republicans care about governance/ethics
.@RonWyden @kevincollier add all members and staff for Congress to the list and just maybe we'll give it a thought. Oh, drug tests, too.
@davidfrum Good idea !
.@RonWyden @davidfrum Day after election, I wrote and called  my Rep and Senator asking for same. Thank you for protecting voters!
@mattdpearce @davidfrum YES! #UndocumentedBillionaire #Billionairtherism
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum we need to know what is going on here. Thank you Congressman.
@robdelaney @davidfrum Thank you Senator Wyden.
You are going to try to make it retroactive?  Isn't his financial disclosure enough?  What do you learn from tax return?
Thank you.  Let us know how to help.  Following.
Why only 3? That seems a rather narrow window view on the most important job in the world. HRC released 35 years!
filed may 2016.  has this been passed and is now in effect?
Thank you!
Trump's pressing Argentinian president to give permission for him to build a Tower in Buenos Aires. Look @ La Nacion. Shameful
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum bull s---.
@aalali44 @davidfrum please #AuditTheVote
without returns, how can Senate consider nominees at Treas and IRS who might affect Trump audit? what issues in audit?
Just called Greg Walden's office and asked him to support the legislation when, hopefully, it's sent to the House.
Need to know what other potential conflicts exist. Do not normalize Trump's actions.  Already appears shady & fishy.
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum thank you Ron! So proud you're my Senator 
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum someone needs to push this before January 20 I think there's a lot of hidden garbage
@davidfrum the people deserve to know the finances of the person they elect to office.
Thank you Senator Wyden is Walden on board with this?
@MaddowBlog @davidfrum    but dead in the water... who will pass it's??
Is it possible to get some states involved with this as well? Not on ballot w/o releasing returns.
Why 3 years of tax returns?? Minimum 10 years to avoid fixing returns a few yearS before running 4 POTUS.
Thank you, Ron.
@davidfrum This is badly needed, no matter what side of aisle you sit.  For P(E)OTUS and VP(E)OTUS as well.  How can we help?
Sure, let's make the federal government as oppressive as possible.  Good plan.
It is called transparency in Government that used to big for Republicans.
@davidfrum R cosponsor?
Thank you. An important step towards transparency for the president elect and all future candidates.
@davidfrum how would it not be an ex post facto law if it passed?  And why would the GOP PASS IT?
Your bill never passed Wyden. Why is that?
I voted for you and I'm glad I did.
@davidfrum Thank you for doing the right thing. Let us know how we can help.
@davidfrum what can we do to help senator?
