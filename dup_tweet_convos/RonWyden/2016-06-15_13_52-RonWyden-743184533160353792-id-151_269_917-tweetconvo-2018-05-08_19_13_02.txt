Shame on Wyden...from Robert Reich
@mistergiuntoli @ChrisMurphyCT @YouTube why not strengthen requirements for terror watch lists and notification for purchases?
Then empower are police depts. to take action. Your trying to add more legislation for guns does nothing!
@YouTube Well, I'm sure I speak for others as well as myself when I say I know my history, and guns ain't going.
@YouTube YOU HAD 4 VOTES THIS WEEK!!!
@mistergiuntoli @ChrisMurphyCT @YouTube Thank you!!!
Tried calling your office but circuits are overloaded. Thank you for demanding action and standing up for us.
Gun Deaths Are Mostly Suicides http://nyti.ms/1QaNk1R  via @UpshotNYT
how about demanding Obama and BLM get off the killer cop crap RONNIE? YOU HYPOCRITE.
Thank you for what you are doing! Thankful Oregon has you there! #NoBillNoBreak
@YouTube Wyden didn't learn anything from his grandfather, just like the Nazis,Wyden wants to disarm us.
Thank you! Gun control now!
Dear Mr Wyden, I would like to propose a voluntary boycott of wild caught seafood citing environmental concerns.
Bernie is the rightful nominee - every single elected rep who stays silent is complicit in massive election fraud.
Ron&Chris Killed Kate's Law So Illegals Murderers of our Cops can Hide in Sanctuary Cities!
Take guns away from Blacks in Chicago. Wait. There is already #GunControlNow in Chicago. Why isn't it working?
WHEN IN DOUBT DEMOCRATS FILIBUSTER THAT'S WHY MORE REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS!
@YouTube
@mistergiuntoli @ChrisMurphyCT We have laws! Why don't u create more gun free zones? Do u want to take the 1st Amendment 2? SMH
More meaningless gestures / photo ops, how about looking into why the shooter had a government license to carry
10 MOST VIOLENT CITIES RUN BY DEMOCRATS! WHY WOULD ANYONE TRUST SEN MURPHY & WYDEN!
@YouTube How about demanding action against the US Army for misappropriation of taxpayers money! Outrageous!
The sooner people understand African-American guns & their alienation w/white guns & get them into good schools etc
do something about criminals. Not law abiding gun owners, please
Stop the E Mail diversion among your colleagues across the aisle. So sick of it. #TooManyHaveDied
RON & CHRIS  VOTED TO BLOCK THE $1 BILLION $$$ FOR ZIKA! SHAME ON YOU!
@OPB people DO end up on these lists accidentally.

@mistergiuntoli @RonWyden @ChrisMurphyCT hello mr david..
@mistergiuntoli @ChrisMurphyCT @YouTube NO TO GUN CONTROL
Bla Bla bal support a President that will protect our country not fall asleep at the wheel!
What has our federal govt done to help with the mentally ill? How many psychiatric hospitals does the govt fund?
No none of us will feel safe if our enemies out arm us here at home. How long before they cross the border?
If they will be federal crimes then when Hillary arms rebels will that be against the law?
Maybe we should stop arming the #MiddleEast first! Oh but then our guys wouldn't be getting shot as much!

THANK YOU!
Thank you. It is past time to act. Vote YES on Sen Feinstein and Murphy amendments. #DisarmHate
Thank you!
If "suspected terrorist" so dangerous to deny constitutional right: arrest, charge, jail. Give due process!!!
Bill of Rights version for kids (and senators who vote against Due Process)
DUE PROCESS IS NOT A LOOPHOLE.
I find it sad that you would support using an unconstituional government list #5a to violate yet another #2A
Thank you for making me proud to be an Oregonian.
thank you!!
so R U also going to have tighter control on pressure cookers, aircraft and box cutters. THAT is UR logic
that's too bad...you are so good on some issues.
U can spin it anyway you want but guns were NOT the main issue @ Orlando. U & rest fail to say the words
like Obama
We had enuff w politicians blaming our Const rights 4 "gun violence," when they fly in Jihadis with R tax dollars.
Thank you!
THANK YOU for speaking for us!
THANK YOU!!! #Enough
