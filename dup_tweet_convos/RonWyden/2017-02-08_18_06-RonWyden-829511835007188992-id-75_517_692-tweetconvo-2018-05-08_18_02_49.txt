I don't think it wise to compare play books.  The Dem party, not so innocent.
i forgot, what happened to Bernie during the primaries?
@SenateDems
Wyden dumocrat playbook; lie, cheat, steal, payola, kickbacks, pay to play, insider trading, misappropriation of funds
..... Back room deals (i.e. Obamacare), need I Go on?
@SenSchumer Price another corrupt nominee. He is as unethical as all the rest. Embarrassing time for America!
oh, you mean like Hillary and white water
Why are
why do Dems blame everyone else for what they do themselves? Reminds me of a school bully. Obstructionist, never vote 4  1 again
@JeffMerkley Are you guys going to do anything other than obstruct and fail at it? When is your next town meeting scheduled?
Must be nice to be wealthy and entitled.
Georgia? You have no standing ;-)
Thank you for fighting for what's right. We are behind you!
@SenSchumer Careful Chump Schumer, do you really want us to start looking closely at your financial shenanigans?  #resignyouhack
please represent ALL Oregonians
Hillary didn't win
@SenSchumer
did he expect 60k people get their visas revoked?
What a difference 8 years makes:
@senschumer JUST STOP CRITICIZING JOIN REPUBS TO HELP US ..AMERICA AWAKE ..TAKING NOTE TO VOTE OUT THOSE WHO DONT HELP
a tactic like this  is why 2018 could make the senate 60-40.
It's obvious being ethically challenged and having COI is a requirement for @POTUS & @GOP. The US is being raided.
He's wrong. But where were you people when Bill Clinton was selling favors through the Clinton Foundation??
@SenateDems Sounds like the Clintons to me.
#noSCOTUSforChump
@SenSchumer This man is incredulous. Nothing that comes out of Trumpland is really surprising at this point.
Politicians who have not done the same, stand up.  Bet they'll all be seated.Don't throw stones if U live in glass hse
Thank you, Sen. Wyden. I have secondary progressive MS and narcolepsy, so listened to Price's testimony w/outrage.
What do you like Pizzaor Pasta?

#NationalPizzaDay 
#PizzaGate
#PedoGate
#BringDownTheRing
u r right.
@SenSchumer that is the trump way
Because traitor trump is the worst of them all. America is no longer a Democracy.
why isn't the SEC investigating
#bologna
@SenSchumer Do you think Hillary could give me some tips on cattle futures now that she's not so busy?
@SenSchumer Ron did you speak out against Pelosi when she bought stock in companies while speaker? Knowing legislation was pending
when asked if it was right her answer was, What's your point
@SenSchumer if chief clown Schumer is against Price I am 100% for him. Can't stand hypocrisy and Schumer is the king hypocrite.
he's a shit a fucking man shit to old ugly only thing left make money
@SenSchumer Elitests and Political insiders pointing their fingers at each other - its really not amusing anymore
The Trump cab.: simply, in total, the most corrupt, inept, dishonest, billionaire, racist, fascist, swamp imaginable.
wow...any examples of your claims?
Vote no!
Steal, then sell at great profit to those stolen from. a parfait world.
@SenSchumer how is this not illegal I hope he's being investigated
it is illegal. He isn't being investigated because it isn't true...simple
@SenateDems Dems make money by saying if you pay us more we will not do our job by sitting on your butts. Lazzzy house and Senate.
@SenSchumer no, that's Warren
Only seat Price s/b sitting is the one in an 8'x10' cell. Why isn't Senate opening an investigation? Survey says: GOP
Like your going to stop him you guys have not stopped one nominee yet Get those elbows up and start playing dirty
@SenSchumer Doctors are just money grubbers very few care about patients. Most other countries don't have millionaire physicians
@SenSchumer locked
@SenSchumer and tell me again why this isn't insider trading. He shouldn't be given a job he should be licked up
it would be insider trading if it were true...
@SenSchumer no more games please
it's very discouraging that an entire party turns a blind eye and holds out their hands to make sure they get theirs in turn.
It's all in the public financial records. He is privy to all the facts. You are not.  #PriceIsWrong
another bogus report from #fakenews @cnn - the communist news network
Wyden is on Senate Finance Committee. He has the facts on record. The opposite of fake news.
what facts exactly? From where's? Post them here for verification
Wyden just spent an hour on Senate floor giving SFC findings. U claim 2 know so much! Do your own research.
You lost the election. Everyone is seeing what the demonrat part is doing and it will have consequences.
hold Repubs accountable
I am sure he will make millions.. lol how much have all you politicians made? and when yo have mutual funds they are disp all over
isn't that this whole Republican admin?
