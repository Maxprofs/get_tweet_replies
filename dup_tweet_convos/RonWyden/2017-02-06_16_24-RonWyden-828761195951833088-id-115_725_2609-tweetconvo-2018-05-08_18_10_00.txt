Please tell your friends across the aisle that the DeVos nom is about pillaging America, making them complicit.
by giving people school choice? Complicity is maintaining the status quo. OR schools are among worst in US @RonWyden
DeVos is heavily invested in curriculum choices that TAKE GOVERNMENT MONEY. Poor kids get left behind-no choice.
wrong. That's the whole point of school choice @RonWyden
Ask yourself why school choice doesn't lead to depopulated schools
no to Devos
Since Oregon schools are rated as some of the worst in US, your views on education don't mean much.
Yes,  the failure @RonWyden loves the unions and hates our students.  He will fight for the failed status quo at all costs.
where do you people believe the cost is coming from, the teachers? They make nothing, and the only reason
Women's March Oregon proud of Senator Ron Wyden #CaresAboutEducation #OregonHero
We have a broken system. Confirm DeVos! Stop your party politics. Do what is best for Oregon and our nation not the party.
since Oregon ranks 43rd in the nation.. maybe we need a new plan..
please tell me how you have improved the schools and education of Oregon's students.. and then tell me how YOU have benefitted
#SpellCheckMatters  
Not an argument. #IntellectualHonestyMatters 
I'm sorry.. I am not trying to make an argument.. just a point..
I was making a point to him that correcting spelling is being a snarky prick and not legitimate refutation
ah.. yes.. I see.. thank you for clarifying that for me..
why Ron? Monopolies don't work. Oregon is close to the bottom on education. Why? Teacher union and no child left behind IMHO
talk to parents who feel their children were left behind
There would be no more public schools.  Everything will be driven by for profit driven companies.
Dems are opposing all cabinet nominees, this isn't news. Remember Dems, the country is watching your childish tantrums.
do u remember  all the Republican tantrums
well you're going to have live with it, so get over it and stop crying.
thanks for trying to defeat Betsy
Yes we know you are only for Union Teachers. Education of Americas children is very low on your agenda. Socialist hell.
well, get used to it, you've got her!  Why not practice governing & try working with her?  Duh!
yeah. Bc you gotta protect the teachers unions. #SheWasConfirmed #SorryNotSorry
he is a teacher, of course he is #NoonDeVos
Thank you for sharing "the Oregon way" & standing up for quality ed for all Americans #NotoDeVos #holdthefloor
heard you speaking w/ @NPRinskeep this morn Thanks 4 cutting through b.s. & explaining why @BetsyDeVos is bad choice 4 Education
do they realize how many poster boards teachers have access to? Unless they want another protest, they should say #NoonDeVos
whose the hottie with the baby on his hip?
DeVos is not qualified for this job . Thank you for opposing her. I am surprised that no more than 2 Republicans oppose her.
our communities with no science fairs, no sports, no band just e-learning & home schooling. Our country=public school. Stop DeVos
Thank you for looking out for our children's education. We appreciate you!
@TheDemocrats tell me how a 3rd grade teacher is so well informed
We stand with you. Betsy deVos thinks she can buy her way into the cabinet. Tell Congress our kids can't afford it.
Sadly, @RonWyden, what difference will opposing DeVos make?  Democrats are now so feeble they can't even block a nominee this laughable.
TY @RonWyden! I  my kids' @PPSConnect teachers! They are THE MOST dedicated public servants.  #NoOnDeVos
thank you for #NoOnDeVos!
@donnabrazile Stand up for our children!
please keep her out! Will McCain help?
Thank you for all of your hard work! #holdthefloor #resist
@donnabrazile  Can you find just ONE more R to stand up for children?????
Thank you, Senator - please continue to oppose the Bannon/Trump agenda and appointees.
I am so proud of the Democrats! Thank you for standing up for our children's future!
@donnabrazile Thank you!

@donnabrazile I have 6 kids in public schools. I am very much FOR Devos. Change, Choice, Charter. #3C4Ed
@donnabrazile Thank you! Proud to be an Oregonian.
@TheDemocrats This video is complete soohestry. Not an argument!
@TheDemocrats don't know if you have this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qlGP6GDz8BI …
thank you for standing against #Devos and making sure to #holdthefloor
@SenJeffMerkley thank you for saying no to Devos
@TheDemocrats Thank you
thank you!  For #StopDeVos  keep up the great work!!
Standing with you Senator, millions of us are! #NoOnDeVos
good for you, Ron!
@SenateDems Thank you for listening to your constituents! DeVos isn't the answer! Our kids deserve better. #noDevos
Betsy DeVos is unfit to be Sec of Ed. All Children regardless of zip code color race gender disability faith origin deserve Ed.
thank you! 
@TheDemocrats And a member of the Democrat dominated teacher's union, I'll bet.
Stop blocking! Put your dang party back together!
The people of America need two fully functioning parties. #RebuildYourParty
@TheDemocrats that's because DeVos would find him unqualified to teach! You must know something in order to convey knowledge!
We need one more @SenateGOP that cares about IDEA and courage to vote NO  @RonWyden @TheDemocrats https://www.oximity.com/article/My-Response-to-Senator-Lamar-Alexander-1 … @SenAlexander
Oh wow, the pathetic pussy Dems taking a stand. I guess Devos hasn't donated to any of their campaigns. Her mistake.
@TheDemocrats you got nothing fighting will not help your party
as an #oregonvoter I disagree. System is broken. New eyes are needed.
thank you #NoOnDeVos
@TheDemocrats -Because after trillion$ spent, the Dept of Edu & public schools have done so well...
We need #choice & competition
@TheDemocrats hmm, let me guess, he's a unionized teacher
PS- Everyone put it down now: #vote November 6, 2018 #MidTermElections #CalendarIt !!!!
Thank you for voting no!
thank you for your leadership and service
Thank you for tirelessly serving your Oregon constituency! I support your resistance to Trump's unqualified nominees!
@TheDemocrats sure all teachers unions are. They are afraid trump will show everyone how bad they are..how easy it is to fix.
That looked more like a hostage situation.
@TheDemocrats Of course he is.  Unions don't promote learning they promote unions!!
@TheDemocrats 43rd ranking school system .... yea hes who we should listen to lol.
@TheDemocrats why are you guys fighting me on this? DeVos is totally qualified and a total fox! SAD.
@TheDemocrats how do I tell Marci Rubio to vote NO for her on twitter?

Thank you Senator Wyden. She would be a DISASTER for our kids. She already screwed up Michigan schools.
.@RonWyden when I lived in Oregon, I thought you were a little flaky; but, you're spot on with #NoOnDevos. Yet, I still delete your emails.
@SenateDems DUH! A teachers Union member against DeVos school choice & supporting institutionalized Ofailure norms!! DUH!
Thank you for helping Oregon. Our rural public schools need support.
you are pro union not pro education. You are not representing your state at all. Common core is a disaster.
I teach High school math in Klamath Falls Oregon and am most emphatically #NoonDeVos
#BetsyDeVos will be great. You support unions for their campaign $ at the expense of our children's education. Shame.
since when do Senators lead rallies on DC? YOU ARE DC! #pandering #MAGA
Oregon teachers thank you for "no"!
That's becauseOregon is becoming a liberal hotbed.
#NoOnDeVos thank you
Thank you, Senator.
@SenateDems can anyone say union over children?
.@RonWyden, meet @realjohngatto and read his book The Underground History of American Public Education: http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gatto/gatto-uhae-1.html …
@SenateDems you do realize DeVos is picked to gut the dept right? Slash budget, lay off slackers, trim and reshape it. Not run it!
@SenateDems - @ThomTillishands - vote no for DeVOs, Gov Pat McCrory lost by going against peoples will; every vote matters in 2018
Couldn't agree more! Time for @RonWyden to go!

Thanks! When will you take action against this regime, not just its nominees?Foreign interference, conflict of interest are not ok
.@RonWyden, meet @IsabelPaterson:
@SenateDems because he belongs  to the teachers unio
His student probably have better speaking skills than you do. With all due respect, he could teach you a lot.
