This anti-encryption bill would effectively outlaw tech that Americans use to protect themselves.
If this dangerous anti-encryption legislation reaches the Senate floor, I will filibuster it. Period.
@RonWyden Glad you're against this bill. Thanks for standing up to defeat it.
.@RonWyden Thanks! Let me know if I can help!
@RonWyden @kashhill You do know a hacker did what FBI couldn't and Apple wouldn't, don't you? I don't feel safe at all.
@RonWyden @kashhill Doesn't it even worry you why all the PR grandstanding by Apple was undone by some paid-for lone hacker?
@RonWyden @kashhill Are you too blind to see that the Big Bad FBI was neither bigger nor badder than a non-governmental hacker?
@RonWyden @kashhill Senator, please open you eyes to see beyond your press clippings. The Apple hacker could have been Russian or Chinese.
@RonWyden Bravo!  cc: @sethmoulton
@RonWyden thank you sir. Most days, it seems you are all that's left of a great country@JZdziarski
@RonWyden thank you. it's nice to live in a state with sensible senators
@RonWyden This is why I voted for you
Thank you @RonWyden for clear thinking and taking a courageous stand against Burr-Feinstein.
I will do everything in my power to block Burr-Feinstein anti-encryption bill. It makes Americans less safe. 
@RonWyden @kashhill How did security agencies gather info prior to cell phones? I suggest they get to work, and use traditional methods.
@RonWyden You aren't my senator, Feinstein is...and yet you somehow represent me more effectively than she ever has.
@RonWyden @kashhill Breaking into people's phones is the lazy, amateur way to gather information. We spend $60 Billion per year on security
@RonWyden & @Snowden are 2 of very few looking out for our digital security. 

#ThankYou
@RonWyden right on!
@RonWyden As a Californian, thank you for opposing my senator. I only hope my Representative @RepZoeLofgren doesn't let it get that far.
@RonWyden Thanks for erring on the side of sanity.
@RonWyden Thank you very much!
@RonWyden Finally. Someone spoke up!!
@RonWyden Thank you for defending this Californian.
I usually support @SenFeinstein, but this is wacko.
Seems like @RonWyden is a politician I could like!
I will do everything in my power to block Burr-Feinstein anti-encryption bill. It makes Americans less safe. 
@RonWyden @paulg True of any bill that puts the needs of public servants ahead of the needs of the public.
.@SenFeinstein: I’m a tech co founder in California, strong on law and order, and I agree with @RonWyden.
I will do everything in my power to block Burr-Feinstein anti-encryption bill. It makes Americans less safe. 
@RonWyden I would rather feel less safe then give up freedoms.
@RonWyden THANK YOU!!
@RonWyden Good for you, Ron. You're one of the few shreds of hope for a more liberty-oriented Democratic Party.
@RonWyden @justinamash including challenging Burr to a duel?
@RonWyden thanks Senator!
@RonWyden Thank you!
@RonWyden I'm not even American yet I can truly appreciate the value in what you're doing. Thanks You!
@RonWyden  Thank you
We greatly appreciated you for this @RonWyden, can't believe our own CA senator @SenFeinstein would write something so harmful
@RonWyden Thank you. @SenFeinstein needs to be educated. #EncryptionBill puts us at risk.
@RonWyden thank you, Senator.
@RonWyden You are still my favourite Senator of all time! Thank you for protecting online rights.
@RonWyden thanks
@RonWyden Thank you Senator! It’s good to hear from a legislator that actually gets it.
@RonWyden thanks for protecting American citizens from their own government!!
@RonWyden thank you!!!
@RonWyden thank you!
@RonWyden hey use that power for US Citizens and block the POS TPP
@RonWyden wonderful, thank you.
Thank you @RonWyden! So disappointed in my senator @SenFeinstein I wish I could take back my votes for her.
I will do everything in my power to block Burr-Feinstein anti-encryption bill. It makes Americans less safe. 
@RonWyden too bad you're not from my state. I'd totally vote for you!
@RonWyden good job
@RonWyden Thank you Senator Wyden. YOU are a true patriot.
@RonWyden @aantonop thank you!
@RonWyden Hope you don't become a turncoat on this as per your habit.
@RonWyden Keep fighting, sir. Couldn't agree more.
@RonWyden @LOLGOP Bad bill tailor made for Cruz/Trump
@RonWyden thank you, from NC
@RonWyden Proud you are representing our state
@RonWyden Thank you!
@RonWyden Thank you from a Brit
.@RonWyden  Interesting how much this reads like an argument against gun control…  https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/720343774099017728 …
Thank you, Senator @RonWyden.  Take note @SenBennetCO. This is leadership.
I will do everything in my power to block Burr-Feinstein anti-encryption bill. It makes Americans less safe. 
@RonWyden Fight On!
@RonWyden you're on fire today! First #BernieSanders endorsement, now this! Looking forward to another true progressive voice emerging!
@RonWyden Just one more reason why I'm never voting for her again.
@RonWyden Are you the only Senator that is advised properly about cybersecurity?
@IslamForbids @RonWyden outside of weapons tech, and military movements,  nothing goverment issued should be classified.
@RonWyden It's like outlawing math
@RonWyden not just Americans...it'll filter across the Atlantic too, sooner or later.
@RonWyden @LOLGOP it's like saying "no one should have locks on their front door because we might have to get into the home of a terrorist"
it discriminates against terrorists
@RonWyden: I will do everything in my power to block Burr-Feinstein anti-encryption bill
@LOLGOP
