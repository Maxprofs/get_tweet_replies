, I created a http://WhiteHouse.gov  petition too, just to show DJT we DO care. 
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/those-running-president-united-states-should-be-lawfully-required-release-their-tax-returns …
Why? How will it affect your life?Didn't the Clintons fraud Found. take big $$ from other countries
The president’s allegiance being the American public & not only wealthy/foreign powers, affects every aspect of all our lives.
like this
Focus on those IN POWER, not characters from the political soap opera of the last year.
So now there's new rules but lets forget about all the corruption for the last 8 years. Got it
to ur point: how did Sec of State’s Fdn affect you? How did emails affect your life? Why are you mad? Bc you were TOLD to be.
Not mad, we won. Yes affects my life because econ. is changing 4 the better & the corrupt swamp is drained. 401k doing well
Now libs want transparency and limited executive powers. Where the F were you all the last 8 years? Hypocrites
Takes two seconds to look up what Presidents have used most Exe Powers. Not Obama, look it up.
It's the impact of said executive orders not the amount. But that might be to deep for you.
Obama used his power responsibly.
PERIOD
And he resorted to Executive Powers long after he tried to get the GOP to pass anything
Name me anything O compromised on outside if the sequester.
Actually the ACA. He wanted to expand medicare to all people instead.
He never had a majority approval on even this ACA.
A lot less than the 52 attempts during Obama presidency to repeal the Affordable Care Act....
20 million without health insurance in the richest country in world..How Christian.  Hypocrites

Don't hold your breath. They had 6 years and have nothing.
@icybooks
@Momskeepinup63 @RonWyden if people care about Trump's tax returns they have to much time on their hands; need a hobby!
Absolutely agree.
THANK YOU!  I care about his tax returns and it is a shame we need a law requiring their release.
@sarahkendzior @RonWyden WE ALL AGREE except for the  and his circus 
You betcha!!!
We definitely do not care. We do however, care about investigating Clinton's involvement in the murder of Seth Rich.
And that lmao
Thanks for making me proud to have voted for you.
excepting Trump and his syncophants, we all care.
citizens nothing, it might cost trump his job though.
great analysis!
Great work!
I know that Democrats hate to be nasty we had to fight we really do but we're going to have to develop that muscle
I care. I want to know if Trump loots the country like an Atlantic City casino.
Can we add President Obama's college transcript?
What did you think when Obama had his records hidden in 08 ?.   bet ya wasn't concerned then.    Fake fucks in dc
To what end? If you found he never paid taxes b/c of loopholes what would it matter now? It's a waste of energy.
@macnham @RonWyden #WeThePeople #Care about #TaxReturns #Conflicts #MuslimBan #Ethics #WallStreetBanker$ #TrumpCabinet
What do you expect this assclown to say. If he releases his taxes he will be impeached.
@CloudContact @RonWyden Excuse the slightly vulgar/accurate term,but I'm ENCOURAGED to hear there are still PPL in DC w/BALLS
Unfortunately, not nearly enough.
When we switch back to Paper Voting Ballots the Republican Party and the Freedom Caucus will be a thing of the past! They win if they cheat!
why should anyone care about Trump tax returns? This only serves to promote class envy
trump would have to develop some class in order to be envied by anyone with common sense.  & we care b/c he clearly is hiding something as he refuses to release them--personally i think the speculation about russia is a little shaky, but i do think he needs to develop integrity
Blah blah we don't care. We care more about criminals and illegals. To bad the swamp clowns don't.
Your bill is good, but less important now that Mueller's undoubtedly got the returns, don't you think?  Maybe direct your efforts towards protecting Net Neutrality; or stopping the so-called "tax reform;" or following-up the Russian sanctions; or ... etc ....
You should talk to @ParkerMolloy & include her tweet. That thing got serious traction.
Okay, it's been 24 hours:
86,458 retweets, @realDonaldTrump #ReleaseYourTaxes https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/819224265681670146 …
A bit rich for Chris Murphy to be demanding financial accountability from Trump.  Paying taxes and mortgages ain’t the best part of this Senators resume. Bad messenger.  With that said, DT should release his taxes.
Oh hell yes, I agree!
#ICare #IamThePeople
why do you care
#obvious
did you want to see Obamas birth certificate or college transcript?
@elhofferdesign @RonWyden why do you care so much?
he has the right to keep it private. Go ahead, post yours. While your at it, post your salary too.
you realize that president is different from every other job in the country, with different requirements, right?
doesn't mean his basic rights should be revoked
it is not a basic right, I give up my history for security clearance, politicians give up their privacy for public office.
Got other stuff to worry about
Jan 2016 almost a year the dream is dead but the tweet remains.
Still amazed people care more about Trump's taxes than actually fixing the country.
STOP HIM before Jan 20th or it won't matter. GOP candidates are ILLEGIT. STOP THEM or what u do won't matter
@mspinkify @RonWyden All candidates running for public office should pass backround checks & have records open 4 inspection
@vickiichristine @RonWyden thank you Ron and Chris. I agree and appreciate the effort.
It would be nice if @ChrisMurphyCT would stand up for the 4th Amendment despite his unwillingness to do so for the 2nd amendment.
Go fuk yourself
Duh - we really care NOT!!!
NOBODY DOES BUT THE WACKOS!
Funny I missed that in con law class. Not only do you have no right but if  dumb enough to think that bill gives you right you are a fool.
he won already, there's no point. Concentrate on helping CT for once. Please
there is absolutely a point. All Americans should demand transparency.
And what are you going to see, He made money, he lost money,
you're clearly not familiar with complex tax returns.
it would give tremendous insight into investments, business partners, debts owed, etc.
if you want, read down my timeline. I did a tweet storm yesterday that gives more details.
The problem is some of us don't care he handed his businesses to his children that's plenty
but it's not. That in no way resolves conflicts.
No FU, enough with the tax returns. He is duly elected president. Let him do his job, get out of the way.
Thanks? How about you care more about the 20 trillion deficit. Bringing it down to 2008 levels would be a start.
Blame whomever floats your boat,  the spending problem persists and grows whichever party is in power.
I care... you care... most of us care... but to Trump we are all no one.
I care! A LOT! I hope you persist!! 
But presidents give up their right to privacy when they hold a public office.
I had to show my taxes to refinance my house.
certainly the president should come with higher standards.
true. But what's there to hide? He promised he would release them
Lets see yours and Ron’s too. Both wealthy men, how did you do that
This is what Trump fears most ! That's where the sins reside that when finally exposed , not even his blind mice can't save him!
how is it unconstitutional?
no need for disrespectful duh, I was asking what you meant. 4th amendment is good point(1)
but could be subject to interpretation.
we can hope, and the senators can fight. I'm not holding my breath, but just hoping. 
@HilahCooking @RonWyden Has the IRS audit ben completed?
it doesn't matter. The IRS said there's nothing preventing him from showing even if under audit
Why does this remind me of the birth certificate thing?
EXACTLY what I said!  Twitter really needs to allow for more room to write!!!!!!
THANK YOU!!!
Some of us could care less about his tax returns.
you're in the minority, then.
He has to fill out a financial disclosure it will cover all his finances. Tax return is not needed
Who completes it & who attests to its accuracy & truthfulness?
The person completes and the ethics office reviews them The tax return stuff is just to get poeple upset
No, it's not. #DonTheCon
claims he donates;
says he doesn't owe Russia $;
says he's rich.
His tax returns would prove he's a liar.
the financial disclosure will have all that in it you folks are never happy
@EsKaLiDiNg @RonWyden who gives a flying fuck about tax returns
the educated and thoughtful, which is apparently a group that excludes you.
when Bernie released his, there were questionable aspects of it. Did it change my opinion of him? No, and Trump's wouldn't either
you are providing some fairly strong positive data for my theory.
Right... only the 'evil' press cares. I'll gladly RT this under my own name.
In Oregon Ron Wyden is known as the Senator from NY. Perfect example for term limits.
Career politician and no interest in real Oregonians concerns
We have term limits. They are called 'elections'.
Unfortunately the status quo keeps getting re-elected
Ron Wyden is a perfect example of why Oregon isn't thriving.
Come to any part of Georgia outside Atlanta and Savannah, and let's talk about 'thriving'.
I live in Missouri now..we ARE thriving!
thats gr8 but @ this point isnt it moot? If our president sexually assaulted women & still became prez, wtf is this gonna do?
Yes we do care, @realDonaldTrump incoming#PEOTUS. You said you'd release them after the election. Don't lie, yes you did.
@ActualEPAFacts @RonWyden we do not need to retweet, just screenshot the WH Petition or hire some Russian hackers.
Yes, let's do see how much $$$$ he owes so we can follow along as he sells out the U.S.; Trumpenov
@AndreaChalupa @RonWyden we want to c his taxes!
release his taxes and when found complicit towards Russia impeach him!
What a waste of taxpayers money.  Get over it!
Check out @funder and #TrumpLeaks
As part of this bill, can the unethical @jasoninthehouse be removed as head of ethics committee?
@SarahKSilverman @RonWyden Pretty sure you and Ronnie both qualify as no one.
I want to see his taxes!
@dumptrump33 I want to see his taxes I feel he has several conflicts that will effect this country  @RonWyden
yep
Trump is not exception, show America your tax return!
Yes I agree and wonder why the GOP is covering up
@KellycanPolls @RonWyden @doedeer1664 to say anything, rep refused to work with Obama on anything I'm neither rep ,dem
Most people only care about their OWN taxes. Can't wait until they come down!
@moneyfinger @RonWyden  Trump is actually broke-he gets a stipend from Putin.
I don’t understand this demand to see his tax return, why is it any of our business ?
@CharlesMBlow @RonWyden   Can I retweet X1000?
@docrocktex26 @RonWyden - PEOTUS promised he would release them and I heard he is NOT under an AUDIT... #taxes
I care. Thank you.
@CharlesMBlow @RonWyden I want to see it!
Do it.
I care.
There are over 500,000 signatures on the http://Whitehouse.gov  petition. #LOCKHIMUP
Seeing @RealGDT RT one of my senators (@ChrisMurphyCT) about Trump releasing his tax returns is the definition of worlds colliding. Love it.
Grasping at straws...
@AuntSnoozie @RonWyden All I care about my tax return If u Dems don't screw it up, it'll be going down. Along with Nat Debt.
Indeed we need to see the IRS returns before he gets rid of the commissioner performing the audit.
that a little late and is not going to pass
more support for investigation of Tillerson/Russian connection. Follow the money.
@SarahKSilverman @RonWyden release Tax returns
@mattyglesias @RonWyden I agree considered it done with lightning speed
Thank you! America deserves to see where @POTUS interests lie. #releasethetaxreturns
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Too many things on your mind. We DO care.  We are waiting.  #emoluments #taxes #russia
Additionally, please withhold consent on all his nominees!
I care about his tax returns - we need to see them
@gruber @RonWyden Agree
YES! WE CARE! Even more urgent than the then Jill Stein's RECOUNT!
@KellycanPolls @RonWyden @doedeer1664 and change few things perks ,salary change ,it's us people who their there 4 ,sucks
Is your office using Intranet Quorum for "virtual" constituent feedback, not human constituents? http://bit.ly/2jEBEdj 
Trump will only release taxes when legally forced to !
I agree... we want to see Trump's tax returns
@RachelAzzara @RonWyden Americans don't care about a bill. Want Congress to call halt until produced. Don't waste time!
@pussy_hat @RonWyden I think its no ones business. Ever. Show yours if you believe in it or don't expect it fm  anyone else.
we demand to see them before going further as well as divestment of all businesses
Actually I just like to bother Mr Tramp and we all know he's following anything tweet about himself
@AndyRichter @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump 
DJT Release your tax returns
why don't you pay a little more attention to your governor Malloy who is singlehandedly wrecking CT
@Kris_Sacrebleu @RonWyden Bless you. For all American tax payers, much gratitude.
Aren't they subject to FOIA now?
@p0liticalPotato @RonWyden thank you for doing this  it is appreciated very much. Thank you for protecting democracy
@SarahKSilverman @RonWyden the so called president again is lying. That's his family values. Let's see those tax returns.
@FerrerAgnes @RonWyden
yes
@ezlusztig @RonWyden I don't care about his tax returns as there would be little if any information on K-1s, etc.  ^..^
@stressgirl70 @RonWyden today no one @CNN area about #RussiaProtests. Are we state run media yet?
I think you're both cry babies @ChrisMurphyCT @DFlexmatrix @RonWyden
He has done everything he can to bring the nation to its knees. His tax returns will tell us why...
Nope, none of your business, a cheap political point.
@ActualEPAFacts @RonWyden I care! @POTUS
I want his returns released.
Thank you for asking the questions ordinary American citizens would ask!
Yes, we want to see his tax returns!
.@ChrisMurphyCT We most certainly do care.
@jellyschapiro @RonWyden #WeDemandAnswers
@SenateMajLdr I know people in Kentucky agree. Senator McConnell needs to represent us #TrumpTaxes
@Proud2Progress @RonWyden I care. I'm Canadian.
THANK YOU SIR. How do we help support you?
@Meadhbh254 @RonWyden decades. So what if the reason he doesn't release them, is because he never filed any? I would make
he most certainly needs to release his tax returns...he told us he would release them "after audit"....
@coreysmith_17 @RonWyden of course that bullshit. Just like everything else Trump claims. More #alternativefacts.
@CloudContact @RonWyden Thank you
@DWLKH @RonWyden YES!  Please
@pejvahdat @RonWyden Thank You!
@MiraSorvino @RonWyden No. Just a distraction tactic at this point, attempt to delay implementation of #MAGA
How is it a distraction? Scan and send it! That's all the steps!
show your taxes Trump!
I'm willing to bet he's in dire straights, and seeing them will expose the cash grab that presidency is.
@WelbourneStud @RonWyden I would expect this bill get unanimous approval......in Disneyland wasting your time. Go to work
That is true, ppl care.  Two of them @HillaryClinton and @MittRomney  hahahahahahahahah
Just do it. RTs on Twitter mean nothing.
@kerrywashington @RonWyden Lot of good that will do, he owns Congress.
@JLBarrow @RonWyden Federal form has times more information because of valuation requirements.
I'd add mental health eval. Min 2 yrs governing experience & educational prerequ. Current 35+yrs any moron can run.
We Americans just wish If Democrats cared as much about fixing the country as they do undermining  Trump
@IntJewCon @RonWyden where was this bill when Obama was running
@Nick_Offerman @RonWyden it is so weird when Senators ask you to retweet them like they are doing PR for taco tuesdays.
I don't care. If he didn't pay them we'd already know, like we all know that al sharpton doesn't pay his
@AGoldFan @RonWyden you should have to show tax returns to vote. Right?
OMG. Please don't force me to retweet a fucking agreement, or I'll have to go underground and start a Resistance.
@ben_mckenzie @RonWyden Thank-you for all you are doing to hold Mr. Trump accountable.
I want them released immediately! We all know he is hiding shit.
We care in #oh12,  We want his tax returns,and his involvement with the Russians investigated
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I care! I want to see his tax return
@AndyRichter @RonWyden I've been tweeting trump almost every day to remind him. #ReleaseYourTaxes
@bpfalk @RonWyden Another democrat that can't accept that they lost. Maybe some puppies or hot cocoa will help.
Um, it's not really that, Lee.
@SilviaAstoria @RonWyden everyone I know wants those damn returns thoroughly vetted.
I disagree.
@CrappyMovies @RonWyden we don't give a crap about his taxes.... clearly the IRS doesn't have a problem either ...
we does not mean everyone ;)
clearly if he was doing something wrong he'd be in jail...  Nice to hear from the peanut gallery
i win?
I sent you a message did you see it?
just now
Just another "alternative fact". Cause in his alternative world, dissenters don't count as people.
Awww, you tender little snowflake.
I'm a conservative republican...
it's worse than that but thank you.There has to be answers re Trump/Russia. We deserve truth-Natl security at risk
@IMPL0RABLE @RonWyden omg..please please lets circus him now...not 2 years
@SarahKSilverman @RonWyden did trump just call me a nobody.
@anylaurie16 @RonWyden I agree!
Thank you.
Yes, yes, yes, thank you, thank you, thank you!
I care about seeing his blasted tax returns.maybe then it will show how to get rid of trump
Can u get a bill to require Obama to release his college transcripts, too? Retweet if you agree w/ me
show us the tax returns!!!
sorry, no retweet. not required under the law. stop whining and do some work consistent with 11/8 pounding
@DrewKerr @RonWyden Because transparency isn't important for world leaders, right?
@dcjohnson @RonWyden is this a joke? if there are real ethics concern isn't there a Senate committee that can investigate?
@LabatutLinda @RonWyden tax returns show nothing..only income & taxes paid.only liberals want it.Hollywood show tax returns..
Heck Yeah, I care about his tax returns!!
..and so you see, he considers you, and quite a few others, "no-ones".
Trump's typical bullshit.
Release the returns!
