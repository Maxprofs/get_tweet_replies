I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!
@Lawrence 4 bankruptcies did they liquidate assets 2pay bk amts owed? No tax returns-now millions to 1stLady to live elsewhere?
If we do the Math Trumps have been living out their dreams off of other ppls loses and one cld only dream abt this life
Trump's refusal to release his returns is an admission of guilt. Impeach the crooked bum.
: Thanks! Also, will you please ask about Carter Page? Jeff Sessions introduced him to Trump!
@sorenmacbeth
read o BBC Trump daughter close friends with Putin daughter they travel together often
will you stand with @RepJerryNadler to ensure we start investigating this admin's ties to Russia?
@realDonaldTrump has said that he's met with Russian oligarchs. His SoS got a medal from Putin. That's basically the same.

Thank you Senator Wyden. We so appreciate you in Oregon.
Come on Donny! Maybe more people would like you if you did release your tax returns. 
@RonWyden @POTUS
@MendezChisox006 you guys need to keep the pressure on this administration.  Don't go for low hanging fruit with them
@LRBitisnot @realDonaldTrump please tell me you’re getting to the bottom of this.  Please.
when will you read what the "deal" actually was it kept the progress of any nuclear advancement from happening. Someone draw pics
@darionavarro111 The entire Trump crew has been violating the US Constitution like it never existed.
Let Putin bomb Ukraine? Bad idea, TERRIBLE! Incredibly dangerous. He's gonna get us all killed!
Russia and the pres are America 's #1 problem
Funnily enough, Trump is using a propaganda technique called whataboutism, used by the Soviet Union.
we do know one thing, and that's his aversion to truth.
Impeach Trump
Trump is my potus thank God
POTUS has no legal obligation to release tax returns. He's obliged to protect national security, by proclamation if needed!
he is being audited
keep fighting!
why don't you work on portland and help unit us instead of tearing us apart potus is going to be great give him a chance #Ronwyden
@ruckawriter But the public isn't interested! #truestory
I can't stand Trump but 1)no law requires tax returns released & 2) if he got $ from Putin it wouldn't be in his taxes!
@Lawrence  Assumption of people outside US: WE are stupid because we voted w/o thinking & obtaining info like tax returns etc.
thank you for continuing the fight. Sorry we lost the DeVos vote.
I've been following you. I'm so glad I voted for you every year!thank you for standing up for us.
.@RonWyden You really need to read this:
dont u think IF he had deals with Russia he wouldn't have made them detectable on tax returns under the table like all politicians
So says the Liar in Chief.
@realDonaldTrump you've seen the information revealed by the intelligence agencies.  Please get this released asap!
Will only come out as trial exhibits House Intel panel or other investigation. @SenateGOP complicit. That's why they want Sessions
@realDonaldTrump hey Mr. President.  Number one in terror is the US.  The Saudi Arabia. Are you reading " Fake News".  #TaxReturns
Stay on trump. Don't let up, we won't. Russian investigation for collusion and voting interference. Stay Public!!
Dump Trump,
Nobody cares about his tax returns. Keep whining and see your minority position shrink come 2018. Stop slow-walking nominees #MAGA
@Lawrence  I guess man child in Whitehouse doesn't know Obama's deal delayed terrorist state from building nuke bomb. This is Sad.
Mr. Trump. Just to remind you Mr. Obama is no longer President - unfortunately you are.
he's still jealous of Obama! Thank you for your hard work!
@Lawrence Did you notice Mr. Trump is president?  Americans are worried about their safety not some billionaire's tax returns.
@Trump_OurVoice  Americans are worried that @realDonaldTrump is going to get us all killed by nukes.
@Lawrence absolutely,
Stay the course Ron! #Resistance
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump DT has lost his mind. I pray the courts will c he's out of control & dangerous. #NoMuslimBan
you don't speak for Oregonians you don't even live here
I agree!
YES YES YES!!  Proud of you Ron!!!
why don't you release your tax returns to Wyden. You scared to show people where you get your other money??? Wyden /Merkley 
@realDonaldTrump 
It's about oil..
@realDonaldTrump We have been asking for these returns for AGES...and nothing happens. What can we do to get someone to listen?
I second that or millionthed it ha
There's no requirement to release tax returns. You're beating a dead horse.
We elected Pres Trump w/o tax returns. Follow our wishes not your own.  #StupidOnPurpose
@Lawrence Someone needs to leak thise bad boys
NO to DeVos!
@Lawrence your married to a Russian, STOP IT ALREADY.
Verifiable #TrumpRussia connections in the #DworkinReport. Thank you for being a leading voice in protecting the US from Trump.
@Lawrence Mitt Romney told Media during convention that Trump tax returns would make him disqualified to be POTUS! Media ignored!
You never cared about @HillaryClinton Russia deals when she was SoS.
https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html …
@realDonaldTrump would like to release his taxes but he's waiting on Putin to send the W-2 form.

@Lawrence Trump said it in his own words. No one cares about my taxes, I was elected President. Well I care and so do others
The Tea Party was screaming bloody murder for months before and after he spoke to Iran. It was a major campaign issue.
thumbs up!
@Lawrence  @realDonaldTrump  trump we demand you release your tax returns. You work for us so get the documents ready for us.
@Lawrence I imagine traitor trump's taxes are full of lies
@Lawrence ‘We see a LOT of MONEY POURING IN from RUSSIA’ – DTJr 'We see a LOT of (cont) http://tl.gd/nnenfa 
@ResistTheRedDon need to set up a go fund me to buy an IRS leaker for DJT taxes.
@ResistTheRedDon and all the other world wide deals that tie directly to Russia. Release you taxes DJT. We need an IRS leaker!
in Trumps Russia, he doesn't have deals- deals have him!
Trump is extremely enamored with Putin's wealth & autocracy; relationship needs vetting and start is taxes. Trust/Verify
Thank you for your leadership. Please keep the pressure on.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Need to keep on this- voters upset and watching
Exxon Mobil stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil if the United States rolls back sanctions on Russia.
thanks for standing for us.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Prove the media wrong. Release your returns.
Thank you Sen Wyden. He has no credibility, and has repeatedly lied to the citizens of our great Nation.
@TheJohnsonPost He says 'in Russia'. Doesn't preclude deals with Russia - investors, banks, etc.
@Lawrence 
Oh! But evidences are piling up: Trump has a deal with Russia. The People demands for it to be brought out in the open.
@Lawrence Impeachment starts in CONGRESS 202-225-3121 Simple Majority Paul Ryan Must Call for Vote Put Pressure on CONGRESSMAN
The campaign is over Senator Wyden.  Get to work on human trafficking & inner city crime.  I respect your work on those issues.
Sir, in the name of National safety, can't they be opened and shared?  Work with Waters yo impeach him
College students can't even use the word "Haters".
What's the connection here, @RonWyden? Don't say you gullibly swallowed the crap about "he's hiding Russian connections?"
Public agrees. Ds should be demanding that he release his tax returns everyday. Public agrees.
Did the President just use the word "haters"?
Please keep it up, Senator Wyden. We the people demand to know the truth about Russia and taxes. Thank you!
Where is the investigation into trump/Putin/election tampering?
The GOP doesn't want Trump's tax returns released.
More and more the GOP is gonna own this guy. They are Trump
Thank you! Keep up the pressure. Oregon is lucky and grateful for standing in solidarity with us!
.@RonWyden i mean is there a relationship or isn't there?
Trump talks about his relationship with Putin back in 2013  #Confused #1in 
Can you pass a law requiring him to release tax returns?   His ties to Putin very disturbing.
Seriously Ron?  Do you really think he took $ from Russia? If so you think he reported it on his taxes? Preposterously idiotic
He was willing to let the American ppl think he didn't pay taxes for 18 years. He's hiding something.
2013
thank you Senator. Americans demand Trump release tax info.
Never.  He's a liar!!
Keep hammering at him Senator!
@Lawrence Speaking of Russia and our security.  What's up with that?  We have a right to know.
"the haters"? I'm embarrassed how this man speaks  (among other things!)
he is such a liar. Pants on fire!!
More gaslighting...
@Lawrence  how insecure is Trump? All he does is whine that Obama did it nobody said anything when Obama did it ..is he 7 yrs old
That is called legal precidence which applies. #StupidOnPurpose
You know when a lie, he deflects to Hillary, Obama and the press. @Lawrence
he needs to stop comparing himself to Obama. He sounds so elementary. #resist
@realdonald Nope no deals with Russia, because he says so. 12% on oil sound familiar Donald?
good job Ron!
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Didn't he just have a phone convo with Putin? Next he'll say he's never heard of Vlad. "Who's Putin?"
@Lawrence 
DT stop trying to compete with Pres.Obama,and please stop comparing "the shots you say U call" to the actual job O did.
thank you. What is all the comparison about. Goodness
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump GROW UP Mr. Trump; what does President Bannon think of your relationship with Russia?
Keep up the pressure on him! Those tax returns must contain a lot for him to protect them so much.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump  Here here
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH MPEACH #ImpeachPotus45
@Lawrence check his statements in 2012 and the loan he received from Putin
@Lawrence I wish Trump would give us his definition of "deal".
@Lawrence He lies when he exhales. Mad as a freakin' hatter.
very differently. For eg. he OWES China, so he speaks ill of them. Look into the oil dealings!!!!
the way he treats putin is the way he treats someone he wants something FROM. After he gets what he wants he treats them
YES!!!!!!
"Odd", he keeps saying none of us wants to see them.
And praytell @realDonaldTrump, what personal deal did @BarackObama make with Iran to either gain/protect wealth?
.@RonWyden @Lawrence Actually, Obama also made a deal about Iran, with, among other countries, Russia.
@Lawrence Who is rump kidding
To make deals with other nations save the peace, if the deals are fair and help both sides.Dont be afraid to Russia
Is this man ever going to let Obama go?
it's all a lie, he couldn't tell the truth if his life depended on it.
I don't think tax return s are what is most important. Work on coming to the middle to represent all of us in Or
Please impeach this corrupt delusional liar before he gets more killed. He could not stay wake for Yemen. People died. UNFIT
Obama whispered in Putin's ear & allowed Putin's to invade Crimea  HELLO  Save the children Vote  Betsy DeVos
#FakeNews
thanks for your hard work! I'm proud to have you as one of Oregon's Senators #NoOnDeVos #StopPresidentBannon is our next endeavor
THANK YOU for pursuing this! His deals w them probably go back so far that he called it the USSR/Soviet Union then.
TRUTH
Thank you! Do all you can to get the Russia info out!!
Exactly. Can the Congress do anything to force Trump to release his tax returns? Shd be required of any president candidate.
Pass law 4 2018 elect.. DJT would have to release. I think NY state now requires to be on ballot. Add CA & he's toast.
Thank you Senator! Tthe American people & your constituents are with you in asking @realDonaldTrump to #ReleaseYourTaxes
Russia says something different
Doesn't Putin have deals with Iran?
Obama allowed Putin's to invade Crimea & whispered  in his ear "wait until I'm President"
At least get the participants right before providing #FakeNews. It was a hot mic w/Medvedev re: missile defense. #Dolt45
took 20 minutes to compose this tweet. He now has a headache. #mentalmidget
Thanks!  Keep up the pressure on this man
he can not prove anything that he says.  There's no reason to not show your returns unless you are hiding something
Also, how he defines "know". Does he mean "know" like Bush knowing Putin's soul or "know" intimately like a lover? Something else?
@realDonaldTrump Mr Wyden I'm one of your constituents and that man scares me to death
But but how he defines "deals" and "Russia" isnt' the same as we do.
Also, there is a distinct difference between personal business deals & agreements negotiated between states.
and working w/ countries for that matter
thank you. Keep saying that. Something seriously wrong with this president.
