Sen. Wyden: Breitbart was started by a Jew and a search of their site shows no anti-semitic articles. Do you have proof?
am guessing the rant he made during his divorce- Google it.
One lone statement made by his ex-wife during a divorce proceeding. That's not proof.
example 250 hate crimes reported to the Southern Poverty Law Center since Tuesday election. As many as previous 6 months.
That's BS. Even if true, what does SPLC list have to do w/Bannon? Name ONE white supremacist thing he's said/written.
And maybe give this a read unless genuine journalism isn't your thing.
NPR is feeding delusional prejudices of its audience. If they want to do that, they should try to live without tax $.
So what do u consider good journalism? As NPR addict (& ex-journalist) I respect facts. Ur tax comment? Obnoxious
@Thomas_Drake1 Meanwhile the radical leftist Nation of Islam/Muslim Brotherhood lover @keithellison Commie gets a pass huh?
The Communists hiding in the @TheDemocrats don't realize how obvious they are to people who are awake
smear attack.  No proof.  If so let's see it.
read literally any Breitbart comment section.
comment sections are where people like you go to cry in text.  Let's see Bannon's words of anti-semitism....
Other his own words from the trial against his wife?
"Oh its fake!!" you respond.
We all ignore you.
you got a link sweetie pants?

Glad you agree. I hope you'll also oppose today's 'announcements'.

thanks for saying this! Wish I was in Oregon 
@MgicSurf YES. Completely. This is horrifying. I have called my senators here in NY already. What else can I do?
The shit ball media ridiculed HRC'S Alt-right speech. She was 100% correct. #mediamalpractice #msnbc #inners
Yeah! Chris Matthews and Michael Steele were soooo upset with her after that! Wasn't dignified politics. Wanted more on policies.
This one is written by Bannon.  http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/07/29/megyn-kelly-all-about-eve-harrington-fox-news/ …
@MattEhrman skier kooks destroying our public lands
@MiraSorvino we now live in upside down world where up is down right is wrong and trump is our leader God help us
It is unreal what he puts out, he was the head of Breitbart.  How is this acceptable.
gotta believe (hope) @jaredkushner will add some rationale 2 equation. Bec believing otherwise 2 depressing #gonnabealong4years
You obviously don't know what you're talking about & perfectly willing to relay a smear. It's a disgrace that you're a US senator.
He's horrible,but he did not vote to support the Israeli fascists when they were killing kids in Gaza though,did he?You did that.
thank you for being vocal about this
@RenaSofer This is my Senator.  He knocked on my door when I was in my 20s.  He was just beginning.  Love him!!!
@RenaSofer Well guess what ass hat... @realDonaldTrump doesn't need your approval.
What about Rev. Jeremiah Wright!
sure he ran it, but he didnt write the pieces. #FreeSpeech
you disregarded the needs of the middle class. Maybe you should show remorse and resign.
thank you for speaking out!
Please make a stand with your fellow legislators. Thank you.
thank you, Senator!
Put that website up so we can all see it!! Otherwise, please stop spreading this drivel!
thank you senator. I hope your colleagues @brianschatz @maziehirono make a statement soon as well.
@kbezzari treason we demand the electors elect HRC

thank you
Thank you for opposing the appointment of Stephen Bannon!
@danbeers member when it's not up to you?
But he and/or several people like him is EXACTLY what one should have expected with the election of Trump. It's what they want.
thank you for speaking out. You represent me!
Thank you, Senator Wyden!
he'd be unacceptable to run a Jiffy Lube
Did you forget he was selected by the most hateful, racist misogynist and Islamaphobein electoral politics
need verifiable links, don't just trust the words of politicians and MSM. Heck the DNC rigged the election against Bernie
@Sho2daPan this is all BS and fear mongering. Source? His ex wife and a few slips of the tongue? What's in your closet sir?
Well, the man he's advising is an unacceptable choice for #POTUS
@bpshow @VanJones68 Why is it that only half the country gets this?
.@RonWyden thank you senator wyden!
Thank you for speaking up, Senator Wyden. Please continue to do so & fight for those of us who are scared.
thank you Senator Wyden
Ron, sorry, but not so. Show one article that trafficked in anti-Semitism or misogyny. You are spreading falsehoods.
Thank you, senator!  We Oregonians are trusting you to help look out for our nation.
.@RonWyden With 1 neo-nazi pick for his staff, Trump's becoming one of the worst Presidents ever, even before he's sworn in!!!!
We don';t have a choice. That's what happens when you support subverting democracy: DNC STOLE THE NOMINATION FROM BERNIE
Proof? Website?
Please post an anti-Semite article originating from @BreitbartNews prove your hate.
@timoreilly an unacceptable advisor for an unacceptable president... we are well past the point of good choices here.
Breitbart is a public website. Should be easy enough to link to some URLs, but you cite none which I think is telling.
Thank you for taking a stand. Please fight this appointment, fight Trump, and fight for the rights of -all- Oregonians/Americans.
But can he run a Twitter account?
We can block Twitter accounts.
but it us no longer our choice niw is it?
Your thoughts on this racist bigot?
yr state is with you, Ron. Thank you. Let's keep the pressure applied!
absolutely. Please fight this appointment. And thank you.
I am proud of you Ron, keep fighting for us.  Don't let Steve Bannon near the White House!
Thank you Senator! Please keep up the fight. You have my support!

Nonsense. I have read that site for years and never saw any such thing.
thank you for coming out strong on this.
thank you
@RavMABAY he's an unacceptable choice for a human being.
the big Hugh u
Thank you for taking a stand against bigotry.
@SenateDems He is part of the basket of deporables  that white women wanted. better than an  private Email server.
. Not our decision
Can this guy Bannon even get a security clearance at that level.
@godlessinCA the President of the free worlds chief advisor is a racist!!! That doesn't sound right to me!!!
what can I do to help?
@SenateDems Any evidence of this antisemitism? Nope. None. Zero. Zilch. 
For a Senator you awefully feckless with the truth.#MAGA
thank you!
Trump is a menace with Bannon as one of his bigoted henchmen.
Stop @realDonaldTrump
Ignore @RealJasonWert. Just another troll trying to gaslight people into ignoring the truth. Best off muting him and moving on.
Well, somebody in power is finally using the correct vocabulary for this clusterf*ck.
thank you Senator!
.@RonWyden correct, except for tense use... @BreitbartNews trafficS in antisemitism, misogyny+white supremacy & Bannon is STILL exec chair
.@RonWyden Thank you for speaking out. Please be sure to hold your Republican colleagues accountable as well. #StopBannon
thank you, sir.
Keep up the good work!
Thank you.
With all due respect sir, "unacceptable choice" is being too nice. We should be screaming from the rafters and then such.
Thank you for understanding this fact!
thank you.
Thank you for not waiting to speak out. I just called your office and was thrilled you've already taken a principled stand.
do you have a few screenshots from the website so we can see how bad it was?
@mikerice6 your unacceptable to represent portland
@Evan_McMullin agrees! Congress should send a clear unified message strongly opposing this appointment. http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/305821-mcmullin-slams-bannon-appointment …
all due respect, what kind of Prez do you think we get, when mental health standards are next-to-nil in an utterly opaque vetting?
@Matthijs85 Mathijs. Ik ben je gaan volgen om meer te weten over de Piraten Partij, maar ik zie je bent een front voor 'links'. 
Unless you have some proof, this is just slander, and a tool to divide us. What is your real intent here @RonWyden?
Thank you Senator! Now demand that Sen McConnell, GOP leadership denounce Bannon. Force them to pick a side.
Thank you, Senator, for saying this. (With respect, from Virginia)
He's been advising him for months....
@JimSt_ it's safe space nuts like you Ron do you need your pinky to and your and blankie your liberal buddies you can cry together
@CFBMatrix but Ellison as DNC chair is ok? Hypocrites.
@JimSt_ pal I hate to bust your bubble we do this right generation will hold the house the Senate presidency laughing my ass off
@JimSt_ you unacceptable you liberal nut climate change toast Dodd-Frank fired Keystone oil flowing EPA Sarah Palin coal-burning
Less acceptable than Van Jones or Anita Dunn?
@MDTeresa 2. “The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.”
Soros has been packing the Democratic Party with radicals, and ousting moderate Democrats for years. Guess you're on board w/him.
voters aged 18-25 overwhelmingly voted against Trump.   There is hope for the future.
Soros hijacked the Democratic Party, and now owns it lock, stock, and barrel.
agree on all counts. Now what are you going to do about it?
thank you for speaking out against hate
Soros has been actively working to destroy America from the inside out for some years now. Yet, Bannon is dangerous? Really?
Have you not met George Soros, the most dangerous man in this country? Nazi sympathizer?
Good job it wasn't your choice then wasn't it ?
Bannen must be the best person for the job if every lunatic on earth says he's bad.
@MediocreJedi Agreed.
FYI, @BradSherman, this is how it’s done.
@timoreilly I would want his input, just to know the opposition
@timoreilly and the news media, almost all of them, only called it conservative. Normalizing racism is horrible.
Please convince your new leader Chuck Schumer to get off the floor and start acting like a leader.
You are a liar. Bannon's partner is Jewish.
but you didn't mind the muslim brotherhood in the Whitehouse or the anti Christian Jew hating Obama either right? #draintheswamp
You are a liar. Bannon has a web site who had Jewish journalists.
@mattyglesias well after the Dems royally screwed this up it is time for you guys to become real liberal progressives and win.
Your President-elect finds Bannon quite fit for that task.

They're like two drops of water (in the same bucket)
actually, he's perfect to run the 4th Reich.
@jeremyl FYI--some might say you're an unacceptable choice for Senate. But we've got to suck that up too. Deal w/it
Thank you for speaking out Senator Wyden.  We need more Senators like you  @sparksjls
Donald Trump's administration score points to Worst U.S.A. Government of All Times every day. I so sorry for you, American pple.

Thank you.

@sacca Thank you for saying this. We need our Senators and Representatives to speak out like this.
It was so nice running into you at airport this summer where we talked forestry & am so appreciative of having you represent me. @RonWyden
Thank you for standing up to hatred!
thank you for representing us in this and speaking up.
& racism
And Trump is unqualified and Unfir to be a city councilman no a dog catcher but no one cares cause they want to repeal ACA
With Putin's involvement & Comey's interference, this is the last  chance the President has to declare a state of war.
@katebingburt thank you, Ron. We appreciate you speaking out against Bannon.
just like the people of oregon when you make choices for us. You have no say so in the matter.
thank you senator. This needs to be said. Apparently it needs to be said a lot, as it isn't sinking in.
Depends upon the nature of the advice.
@HRCFanGal Please Ron Wyden don't cave like most Democrats - fight.
@Prd2bnAmerican   Ok, besides that.....
Thank you for speaking out.
You go Ron! I used to live in your district. I know the part of Oregon you represent is behind you on this! #standuptotrump
@normornstein So are #Drumpf & Pence! Dec 19 #FaithlessElectorsForHillary Campaign Strategy! Start contacting! #TheResistance
.@ronwyden Thank you! Bannon as advisor is egregious, dangerous, horrifying.
@KennethBaer wut you gonna do bout it Ronnie???
couldn't believe how much Trump supporters blamed Jews for America's problems, frightening/evil views imo~
unless
You know
The President is a misogynist ant-Semite
