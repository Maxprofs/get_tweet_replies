We need you to stay focused on Trump-Russia.
already debunked quit watching msnbc there was already wiretap they found nothing
Who debunked it? And please, no fake news.
let's start with November and Obama's comment that no collusion was found and then we can go further
Ok. Stop there. I've heard enough. But thanks. 

so you do like fake news watching WWE
how about all the millions of us that lost our insurance with Obama care.. no one cared about us.. certainly not YOU..
so true people  are so 1 sided now days there blindly following Obama still
people who HAD insurance will still have insurance.. the ppl that will loose it aren't paying for it now.. we are..
I could not afford it
you still can't & neither can I.. this isn't about healthcare.. it's about insurance.. there are better solutions..
Best way to care for everyone is teach them responsibility &self-reliance. Ron #StupidOnPurpose #TermLimits
amen
We already know that Trumpcare is a mess and a fail. Let the GOP deal with it.
Ron give it up and get back to work for America ...is that not ure job
And U think ObamaCare was good? HA!! I couldnt afford it!! 
most of us couldn't
.@RonWyden TrumpUniversity, TrumpSteaks, TrumpMagazine, TrumpAirlines, TrumpVodka, #Trumpcare 
All failed Trump ventures.
so, Senator, let us in Oregon have single payer
@SenateDems Ppl need to stop thinking DJT cares about ppl. He is now and has always been a narcissistic liar!
More Fake News Why don't you read this Law first & then comment Time for Term Limits
Did you care about the middle class who has been economically crushed by Obamacare?
#TERMLIMITS #RONWYDEN
this is so simple. Vote no. Push in Oregon for single payer
and senior citizens
if you're so proud of #obamacare, why are you exempt?!?
#notMySenator #Ny3rdSenator
he cronic liar lie lie lie why he our presudent he horrible only 1month in
@RepNewhouse 
How is this better?  I demand you come home and hold a town hall to explain to us why this is better?
Details are such pesky things.
#trumpnocare
PLUS EVERYONE ELSE HE IS ALREADY HURTING. MARCH PROTEST AGAINST ALL.
do not believe it.
Oh, he is.
So @RonWyden what have contributed to the #AHCA to address these issues?  With this plan we get to chose to buy or not buy and what to buy.
Obama care was a joke. It was a rip off and it was NOT affordable. That is a fact. My private b4 was less and BETTER. THEN I LOST
by everybody, 45 meant himself, eric and ivanka. The rest of you are on your own
Trump probably meant it in a mobster sort of way: he'll "take care" of the poor & elderly alright (by eliminating & killing them).
Deception, They way of the socialist.
Keep up the opposition to the Republican health scam! NO tax breaks for the rich!
I'm among the millions who stand to lose my healthcare with the AHCA! I am on Medicaid and SSI Disability; AHCA will devastate me!
Why not stop the propaganda against Trump and do something for Americans thats what we elected you to do!!!
@SenateDems 24 additional million for a total of 52m uninsured by 2026.
that doesn't even address the millions that have been left behind by ACA. Make ACA better, dump Orange Menace and his dismal plan.
How about all the Americans with Obamacare that can't afford to use it. Obama stole $189 Billion just to keep it working!
@SenateDems but will Dems play hard & as dirty as GOP?? I hope so. This dem losing faith in her party...
@SenateDems and those earning under $250,000
@SenateDems The rest was cut off: "...who makes over 6 figures and is a GOP Billy's donor."
Trump has no desire to care for the American People.  Just his cronies.
@SenateDems Don't let him forget that,repeat it everyday!
@SenateDems Trump IS taking care of everybody...just not in the way we hoped a president would. He will profit from this for sure.
EHAT A CREEPY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT!! ,& THEN. YIKES!!
@SenateDems Keep doing great things Mr. Wyden.
Ron he really meant "nobody"!
Thank you for your hard work looking out for Oregonians like me.
@SenateDems - Obamacare took care of everything except millions of Americans stole Medicare funds etc YOUR HYPOCRITES! 2018 gone !
@SenateDems Just more proof that Trump doesn't even know how to tell the truth. Is this the art of his deal? He must go!
(2/2)...we paid penalty for 4 mos lapse till got employer insurance. Under #Obamacare, had Brief coverage, NO "CARE"!!
Obamacare = NO HEALTH CARE
(1/2) "Coverage" is not same as "CARE." We paid $1100/mo for 2 mos and NEVER GOT 4 KIDS ON PLAN! Then...
@GOP loves America, doesn't give a damn about Americans.
It does count as "taking care" for millions who only got coverage when forced to by the mandate.
Having '#Obamacare' is NO GUARANTEE that u HAVE healthcare. Ask my hb, spends $250m, yet NO Dr's accepting patients! @RonWyden @SenateDems
UNTIL I DON'T @realDonaldTrump.
@SenateDems of course those numbers come from the same CBO that said Obamacare would save us $2500 a year in premiums on average
You have already passed a bill and know exactly what the outcome will be, or R you just making it up to sir the pot of discontent?
@SenateDems Dude it's not even called Trump care it's called America care! Better then Obama Care. Listen and learn. #Corrupt
oh my u r like a jim jones follower.  Didn't wake up and then itv as too late.  The liar in chief.
@HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP When GOP lies along with Trump they lose their credibility too
I'm in Texas, d17, with three far-right MoCs. Counting on you and other Dems to represent ME even though I'm not in your district.
