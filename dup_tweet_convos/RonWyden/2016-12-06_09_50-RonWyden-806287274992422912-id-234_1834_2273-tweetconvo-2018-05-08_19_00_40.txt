Boeing responds to Trump: Air Force One deal is for $170 million, not $4 billion http://hill.cm/baWQIHo  
If my child lied like he does he would be sent to bed without his electronic device.
brilliant guy
.@davidfrum @RealDonaldTrump: I look forward to seeing proof of these stock sales as required by law:

That said, transparency is a good step, but full divestment is the only way to prevent dangerous conflicts of interest.
@PeterBeinart @thehill this is why he doesn't want to talk to MSM.  You lie!  He talks directly to Americans!  Get used to it!
Use the correct word:  He is a lying liar who lies pathologically. LIE. Learn it.  Use it.  Embrace it.  Rinse and repeat.
The formula is easy.  If his mouth is open he is lying.
The best way to treat Drumpf is to ignore him. Us Canadians will comment once in awhile when or if we get bored with our idiots.
@thehill So your OK with $170 million spent on just coming up with requirements and scope of work?
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-threatens-cancel-air-force-one-order-boeing-stock-slips-n692511?cid=sm_tw …

Read yourself, tweeting w/ an agenda only make you look foolish. Middle of article, he is right on 4B/
Show me your taxes Donny!
@thehill we American's are a bunch of fools.
@thehill So your argument is that no one knows the number but your number is right because it's not Trump's? Got it.
When @billybragg is retweeting @davidfrum and I’m following both of them, I just don’t know what’s real and what’s an acid trip.
@thehill you said he had no chance to win so we are surely not going to listen to you.
@thehill I wonder if you were as worried about Clinton Fdn REAL pay-for-play scheme as you are about Trump POSSIBLE conflicts
@thehill his life has been saying whatever serves his purposes. Don't C that changing but news agencies need 2 stay credible!
@billybragg I think Boeing has a $170m contract for exploratory development but actually designing and building will cost more?
So he tells lies, well who would have thunk it?

wonder if he shorter Boeing first
I'd much rather Trump had held his stocks. I want him personally invested in growth and to feel some pain if he causes panic.
No!
@Jodi4168 @Amy_Siskind @brianstelter @maddow @JoyAnnReid @jaketapper Don't accept Anything he says #DontheCon #ConflictofInterest
What's $3,830,000,000 between friends.
prob based it on what he paid for his 757  as we know a 757 is bigger than a 747 or thats what the salesman told him
....now he is saying he sold a few,  in a couple of markets...he lies and most believe him so...
In the donaldland, by now, his latest fib has already been perceived as truth: "#PETUS saves US $ 3.83 billion!"
@thehill I think America needs a group hug and good cry, the future really looks bleak.
@Astwisa @thehill Yep--We're to take his word.
oh yep....suuureeeee he tells the truth, like always.....
am I being thick? Why would he drive down the price of the stock if he still owned it? And if he doesnt then how does he benefit?
I read recently that he had sold his shares prior to the idiotic rant against new Air Force one.
How do we ever believe anything he says? He lies like a two year old child.
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-threatens-cancel-air-force-one-order-boeing-stock-slips-n692511?cid=sm_tw …

Go ahead and read.....middle of article says he is right on 4B.
Retraction @davidfrum ? http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4015320/Trump-RIGHT-Air-Force-One-Government-budget-documents-Boeing-program-slated-cost-4-billion.html …
@thehill He invents a lot. He's also deporting 2-3 million illegal immigrant convicts too.
@thehill lies lies lies lies lies lies
When a liar tells you who he is the first time and you don't believe him then it's on you if you continue to believe him
No you shouldn't. Just tell @realDonaldTrump you don't believe him. Let him prove it if it's really true
@thehill and that he's under audit. Do we even know if it's true?
@JoanieGentian @thehill the base 747-8I sells for $374million... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-8 … 
And their quote is about specing one...
Trump lie?
@artim942 Good question. You and a couple if your colleagues seem to be the only ones asking the the Tweet storm level Q's lately
I think Fabricated might be a better choice than invented?  We can believe as much of what he says as we ever could.
#AMEN!
maybe he sold short or bought put options.
Like we acceptd his unverified word that tax returns were being audited without any proof, not even a copy of the audit letter
@thehill Everyone will be exhausted in four years.
Come on Repub, B ethical here! U know he is a classic con! We can't take his word! His good faith effort is non existent. Taxes?
its easy enough to prove. #ShowMeTheTaxes #RealPresidentsDontHide  Follow me, for a campaign to shame him into showing his taxes.
@thehill #rekt
Huh?  There are documented statements that the cost will be 4 billion at time of delivery.
@stumblingstudio @thehill Wonder if DJT was shorting Boeing stock? We will never know.
$170 mill is just for design and specs
for reference Mexico aquired a smaller Presidential plane last year for $750 million from Boeing
@thehill Cheaper if he buys s Russian plane and equips in China
@sterlace_fran David, it must be embarrassing to watch your party fold like a cheap suit!  DT is an embarrassment to our country
@blankmw @thehill The lies just keep a comin Are there any truths within you? @realDonaldTrump #notmypresident
@thehill This is easy. Do not take Trump word for anything.
no
@KristiIA @thehill not a chance.
@thehill this is an unending nightmare...which is beginning before he is even President!
Brace for impact folks. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. The bullying that Trump supporters are cheering on will doom us!
@thehill Don't accept! Verify! And please keep it up. For all of us.... Thanks.
@nunuvyerbiz @thehill Trump is clueless about what electronics, avionics and security systems go into AF1. #TrumpsacluelessIdiot
@thehill  What's the truth? Does Facebook know?
not just that. Over $1B in artificial stock price flux. That is highly unethical and shows lack of regard for office
He didn't invent the price, actually.
apparently he was responding to something the CEO of boeing said about his policies
How could someone lies soooo much ...? But I do think he have dementia... 
@Rich_893 @thehill I guess trump was listening to another one of Flynns conspiracy theories. Just be glad he didn't have gun!
@ginag63 @thehill IF Trump did that, there is no way he would not--could not--have mentioned it w/that motormouth he has.
This man has conned America and no one seems to notice or even care.
and he earned 4b doing it
You are so correct! Tax Returns are "Pandora's Box" to Trump Transition
@JamesFallows @thehill 
I bet most of his " advisors" made a bundle in Boung options today.
@RetroWarrior82 -He probably sold in June bought back on 'release' of his Tweet.
fake news???
Like you said: Follow the money. Below is DT's new AF1 plane. Its even equipped with messanger pigeons.
@thehill Another lie? Not surprised at all.
@thehill All part of the same new economics being Frankensteined before your eyes!
@thehill Looks like a stock short for his near and dear to me
You can't believe nothing Trump say. He lies without blinking and enjoys the attention that the lies bring. Nation is in trouble
Wait until he finds out how much Fox News claims the president spends on vacations.  OUTRAGEOUS!
@thehill could we see the receipt?
Maybe a total price for life of craft maint? R&D + special equipment? But $170 million? Unpainted w/no seats it's more than that.
There is no way that lying sack sold his stock in June. He doesn't plan that far ahead and didn't think he was going to win.
.@davidfrum @thehill  he needed to drive the price down so he could buy back in cheaply.
@JenniferLeeUSA Who did he sell it to? Ivanka?
.@davidfrum @thehill Hail the liar-in-chief. There was never any reason to assume Trump would change after election.
@Ahurastan @thehill New 747s don't cost $170M. USAF has budgeted $1.65B just as 5-yr downpayment. http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/11/16/white-house-seeking-new-air-force-ones.html …
@thehill 
He made today's statement in retaliation for Boeing's CEO making negative comment about him/China in Chicago paper
and more than worth pointing out Trump knows how to conceal stock positions (see his FTC settlement):
where did he get that 4 billion dollars from. The man lies about everything that can be refuted with a fact check.
Did he short Boeing?
It's not like he's ever lied to us. OK, I crack myself up.
such a bad idea to get into this truthiness game. NBC News says the # is legit.
@thehill can't believe a word he utters
wouldn't it be nice if he had a press conference or released his financials? http://witnesspost.press 
@akimcampbell Did he sell them or short them?
did he sell all of his stocks knowing that he was going to sink them?
@thehill : and that $170 B number is for two aircraft, not just one!
@thehill he is completely unhinged
@gabeschoenfeld @thehill Trump is a liar. Well known fact. Why does this surprise anyone? He is a very sick and disturbed man
@slack2thefuture @thehill Remember...he admitted 30 times under oath that he lied & his lawyers would only meet w/ him in pairs.
About time someone said it RT @davidfrum ...we are to accept his unverified word that he sold all his stocks in June?
@thehill I would not trust Trumps word under any circumstance. He would lie about absolutely anything.
hell no, we want the receipts
since he never released his tax returns, he will never share any details of his business but of course will claim divestment.
Hasn't the gov already paid upwards of $90 million of the $170? Is the great & powerful Drumpf gonna get that back?
@thehill he's pushing to use his own Trump emblazoned plane
@thehill The Atlantic #fakenews?  "The $1.65 billion budget for the next Air Force 1 is expected to grow" http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/air-force-one-point-three/385037/ …
@davidgolbitz @thehill  More fake news.
@thehill any who take Trumps word on anything are being foolish. Deliberately foolish.
@thehill that is the price if they plate the entire plane in gold
.@davidfrum And how about an assurance he didn’t short Boeing before his tweet? He could be doing anything. I guess “that makes him smart”
@thehill #DonaldTrump is a #liar! #dishonestdonald #corruptdonald!
according to NBCNews, he's not far off on the $4bn #
Boeing: "We'll throw in some delicious snacks!"
@thehill Who is watching Trump today? Obviously they are failing.
it's trump mad at Boeing for some reason?  Chicago trib...
who in Trump's circle of family, friends, & associates were short Boeing? We should look into this.
trump was correct.
US Air Force official: Price of new Air Force One project expected to be more than $4B by time aircraft delivered - @ckubeNBC
Trump is an unrepentant liar. Challenge EVERY statement out of his mouth. Make him PROVE it.
@MaxBoot
US Air Force official: Price of new Air Force One project expected to be more than $4B by time aircraft delivered - @ckubeNBC
I doubt he was considering this, but the perhour flying cost of airforce one and it's usage rate, each aircraft could easily
end up with an additional cost of a billion plus over the lifespan of the progrsm. Which would bring it to 4bil.
Inventing his own facts is a Trump hallmark. It's another version of "Wack- a- Mole". Be ready for the next one. #Distraction
@thehill There are no longer any facts about anything. @realDonaldTrump is a bold faced liar.
Bonus! Now he can bill Feds to use his plane. Which most likely has gold toilets.
@thehill For every Trump tweet, there is a scandal he is hiding.
@sasnakmwb @thehill Trump lied about the AF/1 $..,tanks Boeing stock$, his insider pals buy Boeing on the cheap! EC save us!!
He gets his way (and gets away) with behind the scenes antics because people are still focusing on him like a reality TV star.
The real question is WHY does press STILL take his bait on his outrageous tweets & not look at bigger issue w/him the same day?
He tweeted about AF1 to have media talk about that & not dig deeper into claim of stock sale. He plays bait & switch all the time
maybe it would be good if he finally showed us his taxes
Invented is understatement!
Inflated more than 20 times!!!
@thehill Demand the SEC filings. More likely someone at Boeing hurt his feelings. #DonTheCon
What else can we do? Who will call him out when he is/does wrong? Who will hold him accountable?
No. When someone shows you who he is, believe it. He's lied about it before.
@thehill ROTFLMAO
@thehill He is not an intellectual. He is an expert con man. With every step he makes he proves he is way over is head.
half truths by the way are also lies..
@thehill don't trust Boeing either; are you sure that Boeing doesn't have other ways to pull revenue streams from the contract?
exactly
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-threatens-cancel-air-force-one-order-boeing-stock-slips-n692511 …  The tab appears to be in the $4 billion range, according to this...
NYT interview he said there's no law against conflict of interest for him...did he forget to say he sold stocks?  Liar.
I'm smelling impeachment
$170M Boeing stated was for prebuild design & planning only. Build est. is $825M for each plane = $1.65B
@thehill not even close dude, NBC reports that all the research and development amounts to billions, not millions.
@anneapplebaum @thehill
White House on Trump: '...statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement.'
@bobcesca_go @thehill uhhhh, no. No we should not.
@JamesFallows @thehill  Boeing statement is a bit unclear - this phase of the deal is for $170 million not the whole deal no?
@SolidBlue2012 @thehill -he exaggerates about everything-Boeing,voter fraud, size of his...never mind, you get the gist
@thehill I'm anti-Trump but per Boeing the $170m is just "to determine the capabilities" of AF1, not build them
Even if he did, how many did he buy today after his tweet caused stock to drop? Profit overnight from the BullyPulpit w 1 tweet?!
Remember all that stuff about taking him seriously, but not literally?
@SolidBlue2012 he got his wee little feelings hurt when they expressed concern over his trade policies so attack mode&twitter
@thehill meanwhile, @nytimes still showing "$4 billion" in front page
@thehill did he short he stock?
yeah.. Like his tax returns.
He is a LIAR.  He does not tell the truth.  EVER.  Why do we keep acting incredulous over this? Investigate every time he speaks.
MSM believes EVERYthing T says
I wonder if this is just to punish Washington State, where he got just 37% of the vote in Snohomish Co. where the 747 is built?
No. We cannot accept his word on anything. He refuses to verify anything, incl stock sales. @ElectoralCollge @HamiltonElector
The SEC will probably know if he didn't. That would be leaked
@JamesFallows @thehill more likely a sign that he's short Boeing right now.
@thehill @StephenEspinoza Too bad Senate Dems aren't interested in investigating that.
actually?
GOP @jasoninthehouse REFUSES 2 DO HIS OVERSIGHT JOB
@SenateDems keep asking

@davidfrum @thehill @StephenEspinoza
show me the paperwork

this lunatic is unhinged.. and so is @realDonaldTrump ..
It'd be easy to check: Just look at Trump's tax returns. Is that so difficult? (Yeah, I know.) @davidfrum @JamesFallows @thehill
Ha - cute to see Boeing using facts to counter Trump. Good luck with that.
If he sold them in June why wait to tell us now. It is BS.
Any issue Trump can be trusted upon? He lied about the AF1 price, probably lies about selling his stock. @davidfrum @JamesFallows @thehill
Yes, you disloyal RINO. Get in line. Follow Ryan and don't pay attention to the tweets behind that curtain.
@thehill Sure would like to see some paperwork on this.
Why accept it? Dig, investigate.
.@davidfrum @thehill "See that plane, see that plane? That plane was built in America!" - #DonaldTrump
@thehill Adieu dear David. Your tweets are tiresomely repetitive.
Door  
Butt
I expect you know the drill.
I'm not sure I buy the story the Taiwan call was pre meditated either, if so, why not defend it that way at the time?
Anyone who believes Trump about anything at this point is a fool.
@thehill Trump tweets and it is safe to just assume it is a complete made up lie.
I don't believe "anything" Trump says.  He needs to prove it.
@thehill and bought Boeing puts, perhaps.
$170mm is just for a study. #'s for cost of planes is all over the map (no big surprise).
Perhaps Trump wants the government to pay for the rides he takes in his little Trump plane, and make his own company richer?
@thehill misinformation is the tool of a dictatorship
Yep! DJT would *never ever* say ANYTHING misleading for financial gain or political power, shame on you. **sucks thumb**
@thehill  o
Wouldn't it help explain his willingness to attack Boeing?
maybe it's about helping kids with shorting Boeing?
@thehill he's writing his own narrative then cries foul.Truth is gone. everything he says is a lie. That's the reality.
