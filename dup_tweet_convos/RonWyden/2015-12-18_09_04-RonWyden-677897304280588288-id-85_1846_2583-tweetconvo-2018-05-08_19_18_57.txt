Unacceptable surveillance provisions are a black mark on a worthy package I fought for.
This legislative package is the biggest tax relief for working families in 30 years.
Students, families, veterans & workers will all receive relief under this package. It is the biggest anti-poverty bill in decades.
@RonWyden @VirginiaInCal  But you look the other way on nefarious control of internet access imbedded in the TPP, save it Wyden, we see you.
@Shizzletheland @RonWyden Thanks for reminding me.  Primary the Dem turncoats out of office !
@VirginiaInCal @ZaRdOz420WPN @Shizzletheland @RonWyden 

14 Bad Little Democrats voted for #FastTrack!
Primary Time!
@Will_J_Bryan @ZaRdOz420WPN @Shizzletheland @RonWyden These turncoat dem's all need to be primaried out of office. #NoTPP
@RonWyden Voting against this bill is right position as voting for it is nothing more than vote for more BIG gov. Wish that was your reason.
@RonWyden thank you for doing that !
@RonWyden thanks for standing up for our security.
@RonWyden @Snowden @ACLU  #CISA violates #HIPAA, that invalidates it, no?
@RonWyden @Thomas_Drake1 Thank you for taking a stand.
@RonWyden thanks :D
@RonWyden @CANARYorg If that is the only reason, that's not good enough Senator...
@RonWyden @Snowden "I AM AWARE of THE RAMIFICATIONs "OBAMA BEHAVES ROUGE>SHOULD NOT BE DOING UNTO ANY of U > LET ALONE THIS COUNTRY> TREASON
@RonWyden @Snowden Hell yeah Ron, thanks for taking a stand.
@RonWyden As an Oregonian, you continue to do work that makes me proud.
@RonWyden thank you Ron!
@RonWyden @Thomas_Drake1 too late to have this dude run for president?
@RonWyden @Thomas_Drake1 USCG spends thousands in taxpayer money spying on whistleblowers for the purposes of retaliation. Shut them down.
@RonWyden EVIL! THIS CISA LEGISLATION EFFECTIVELY "LEGALIZES DOMESTIC ESPIONAGE" OF "SUSPECT CONSUMERS" AND "TARGETS OF INTEREST"
@RonWyden @newlinla 
And the TPP doesn't do that?
@RonWyden @Snowden With how things have been going, maybe we should try turning it off and then back on again.
@RonWyden You're not my senator but, I sincerely thank you for trying. (Colorado)
@RonWyden
Thank u.
Much appreciated.
Let's work towards pure end-to-end encryption so all the fascists have is a jumble of crap to collect.
@RonWyden @YourAnonNews I'm so thankful to live in Oregon and have you as a senator. #hero
@RonWyden @YourAnonNews that's my Oregon senator!
@RonWyden I know it sounds corny, but history will remember and appreciate you. Thanks for being a truly independent thinker.
@RonWyden @Snowden Thank you, Senator Wyden! Pleased to have you as our elected official.
@RonWyden Thank you for doing the right thing. History will remember you for this.
@RonWyden Clearly you have support from voters of both parties in this decision
@RonWyden @BaruchSFR  #StandWithRand
@RonWyden too bad the rest of Congress are a bunch of #SellOuts
@RonWyden Thank you for doing everything you could to #StopCISA
@ronwyden Thank you! Despite not being my representative, I'm happy to know there are people in congress who care deeply about privacy.
@RonWyden @Snowden Thank you for keeping your word to us despite how hard that must have been.  CISA is the death of our last liberty.
@RonWyden And things like this are why Iâ€™m happy to have you representing Oregon.
@RonWyden @Snowden Just call it what it really is: "Law Smuggling"
@RonWyden Thank you, Senator Wyden, for voting against CISA. Though I am not a resident of Oregon, I am glad you are in the Senate.
@RonWyden @raveyote Thank you, Senator.
@RonWyden Thank you.
@RonWyden thank you.
@RonWyden @Snowden SIGNING AWAY OUR PRIVACY AND LIBERTY
@RonWyden Thank you, sir!
@RonWyden @Snowden well what do you expect from an emerging corporatocracy
@RonWyden @Snowden Thank you for representing the values this country and her population hold dear.
@RonWyden not entirely sure I agree, but that is a principled stance I can respect.
@RonWyden as an Oregonian who believes in freespeech, anti-censorship, and privacy from gov, I appreciate your support.
@RonWyden Thank you for drawing an important line & saying "No."
@RonWyden my man. Voting for the people once again. Glad I gave you my vote
@RonWyden @Snowden From the 'most open' president. Who knew he meant us, not him?
@RonWyden @Snowden Thank you for voting against the #CISA provisions buried in the #Omnibus Senator!
@RonWyden @Snowden CISA= Covering their ass for Illegal Spying on Americans
@RonWyden @Snowden thank goodness somebody did...
@RonWyden thank you
@RonWyden @Snowden
@RonWyden at least someone gets it...
@RonWyden Thank you so much for your vote!
@RonWyden @aantonop Thank you
@ronwyden thank you.
@RonWyden @justinamash thanks Ron
@RonWyden I cannot thank you enough for your leadership on this. I am disappointed that your peer's flippantly ignore our right to privacy.
@RonWyden @justinamash Thank you, Senator
@RonWyden @accessnow youre a legend Ronny
@RonWyden I suppose you would have voted for it had you not had the cover of your party and RINOs to pass it.
@RonWyden @repgregwalden Omnibus bill is like a real bus on the backs of Americans. $1.1 trillion? Really? When will you guys ever stop?
@RonWyden Real question is, why do you guys even allow un-related riders to bills? Should be a policy against that sort of thing.
#KeepTheBan, NO crude oil exports. Bad for #climate. Stop #fracking, #BombTrains. #Endfossilfuelsubsidies. @RonWyden
@RonWyden Thank you Senator Wyden
Thank you so much, @RonWyden. It can't have been easy to vote against such an important omnibus bill, but it was the right thing to do.
@RonWyden thank you!! 
@RonWyden thank you.
