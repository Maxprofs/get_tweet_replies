in the pocket of #plannedparenthood.  Your special interest is showing.
Wow, you might be standing with a crowd of thousands, but U found 3 way out lefty's & you think it's so awesome...what a joke!
They only represent a small small portion of women.  The majority are against their message as they will soon discover!!!!
Thank you Senator Wyden!
way to go, Senator. Thanks! 
this pic would b lost on Trump TY 4 sharing and making me smile
YAY
why aren't you wearing your pussy hat in support?
Thanks! pls cosponsor @SenatorShaheen's Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (HER) Act to end the #globalgagrule once & for all
Are you kidding me, Ron?  Did you see marches/violence when Barack Obama became president? The difference between Reps and Dems.
I shld ove 2Oregon. Plse smack Sen.Dean Heller 4 me, and tell Chaffetz my Utah mom wants him to do his job!
Thank you from Boston Senator Wyden! Welcome to the first day of the resistance!
A MARCH FOR AN AGENDA IS NOT A MARCH FOR WOMEN
Why were women who support LIFE not included in the WOMANS MARCH.

Thank you for marching!
Thanks for Supporting Women, Oregon and AMERICA !! 
You ARE a KEEPER #!
protesting fear
Thank you for supporting the #WomensMarch - I'm proud you are my senator!
we need more like you- thank you for what you do.
Get over it! It was fair. The electoral college was a landslide. "Get over it. You lost" --Barack Obama
you didn't get my vote. If it wasn't for the liberal valley you would be out of a job.
Thanks Ron!  I'm so glad to have you as a Senator representing Oregon in Washington.  You and Jeff are great!  :)
thank you 
Bravo Senator!
love,  love this
Keep up the good fight re: CIA nominee!
T/Y for being there!  Will he hear us?
You are a dope!  From a lifelong Oregonian. #WomensMarch
women in other countries actually have it bad; #USA #feminists don't accept pro-life #women #Hypocrites
Salem knocked it out of the park

honestly, why are these women marching? Is it because of abortion rights? If it is, then say it; I am for #HumanRights #prolife!
@WomenMarchPDX thank you for marching!!!
Oregon thanks youYou can blow out a candle But you can't blow out a fire The eyes of the world are watching now

@WomenMarchPDX here w #WomensMarch
Thank you, Ron!
Love the Planned Parenthood scarf, but why no pussy hat? I'm sure someone would be glad to give you one.
You only support high $$ agendas, right?
Obstructing Pompeo makes you small & churlish nputting party before country. Why did I even think you would support America?
it's disrespectful and undermines a new president when you march against him on his second day.
Thank you!
Thanks for being a part of this! Wish I were there too! Very proud of you!
I love you, @RonWyden 
Thank you for representing ME

First time I've been proud of Wyden!  ;)
This is pretty awesome!
Keep it up! Your constituents support you! Fight the Trump agenda of hate and darkness.
proud of my senator for standing with women #WomensMarch

Ron, look again. I don't think those were women you were talking to. You've been punk 'd
you should be proud.
Is @realDonaldTrump a legitimate #US president?
Glad to see you there, Ron!
