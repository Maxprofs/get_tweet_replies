.@WydenPress @RonWyden Only 24% of America supports the Iran Deal, you folded to the party and sold out Oregonians, Thanks a lot.
@WydenPress @RonWyden WTF ru thinking! you need2THINK about Americans instead of your wallet&party loyalty. Change your vote or enjoy hell
@WydenPress @RonWyden Iran Supreme leader said today, "Israel will not exist in 25 yrs" But u give them $, missals & nukes by then.
@WydenPress @RonWyden thank u for supporting peace.
@WydenPress @RonWyden 
Representative your vote to support Iran deal failed to represent me
@WydenPress @RonWyden Thank you!!
@robinpdxtweets @WydenPress @RonWyden Thank you for selling Israel for your political gain. Tja k you for supporting the deal with a devil.
Shame on you, @seagull1973.  @RonWyden is the son of Holocaust survivors. He made a difficult decision that will protect the US & Israel.
@robinpdxtweets @RonWyden More shame on him. He is endangering Israel and enriching a terror state. Very ignorant decision.
@seagull1973 @RonWyden Not according to the majority of Israel's senior security and military experts.
@robinpdxtweets @RonWyden Actually the majority of Israelis are against this deal as well as any politicians in USA. Use your common sense.
@seagull1973 Politicians vs security experts? Use *your* common sense.
@WydenPress @RonWyden Iran deal is supported only by the minions of party politics.  Screw the people for political power!
@WydenPress @RonWyden How can you justify voting in favor of the Iran Nuclear Treaty? Did you see this article? http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/world/middleeast/iran-ayatollah-khamenei-israel-will-not-exist.html?smid=fb-share …
@WydenPress @RonWyden I'll never trust you again, on anything. I hope God makes you pay for what you are letting happen.
@WydenPress @RonWyden Thank you very much Senator Wyden. Very proud to have you represent us and vote for a sensible foreign policy issue!
@WydenPress @RonWyden good choice Ron!
@WydenPress @RonWyden You voted for giving.millions to terror state that funds Hamas and Hezbollah.What do you think they will do with money
@WydenPress @RonWyden Besides pleasing his benefactors in Iran, can anyone tell me the benefit to the #IranDeal ?
@WydenPress @RonWyden Thanks for supporting this deal, Senator.
@WydenPress @RonWyden Time for you to go. Blue does not look good on Oregon. No deal is better than a bad deal.
@WydenPress @RonWyden May this dreadful decision follow you and your family for the rest of your days!
A disgrace to your parents!
@WydenPress @RonWyden Ok, I read this. Doing nothing, is better than funding terror! Saddam was less a threat, than Iran is now.
@WydenPress @RonWyden u r a disappointment, U say u don't want Iran 2 get a Nuke, but I'll teach my Oregonian kids & grand kids u caused it
@WydenPress @RonWyden This is a Terrible Deal. the Deal makes the US the largest state sponsor of TERRORISM in the World! Don't Trust Iran.
@WydenPress @RonWyden  headline The Oregon Deal by Wyden Step 1, list out all of Irans purchases. Then sign off on all of them with pride.
@WydenPress @RonWyden It is a Treaty, not a deal. Serve the people not a lie. Its what you swore to do.
@WydenPress @RonWyden foolish! History written all over this Obama blunder and u fall in the trap. Read Time editorial over Iran. #IranDeal
@WydenPress @RonWyden Diplomacy  doesn't work with EVIL ....its people may not be evil But their Leaders are.
.@WydenPress @RonWyden so proud to call Oregon home. Thank you senator!
@WydenPress @RonWyden Stupid and dangerous decision that will never be forgotten.
@WydenPress @RonWyden Shame on you, Mr. Wyden. Your  vote will go into history  and will not be forgotten. You just sold your soul to devil.
@WydenPress @RonWyden I've trusted, supported & voted for you since the Gray Panthers days... with reason. Thank you.
@WydenPress @RonWyden  
I appreciated your wrestling with this decision.   I'm confused about how you would throw caution aside and vote yed
@WydenPress @WhiteHouse @RonWyden hope your not thinking about running for another term. #IRANWECANNOTTRUSTTHEM
@WydenPress @RonWyden You made the right decision, Senator. Understanding your concerns, we must pursue diplomacy going forward.
@WydenPress @RonWyden Im so sick of these limp-kneed Dems. They should have ALL come out for the deal the minute they read it! Shame!
@WydenPress Thank you so much, @RonWyden
.@WydenPress TY, @RonWyden Good job! The #IranDeal will take out Iran's capacity to make nuke weapons, and that's a good thing!
@WydenPress @RonWyden So, you sold your soul.  Good luck to you...#IranNuclearDeal
@WydenPress @RonWyden 
I am deeply ashamed at our elected officials for their dangerous SUPPORT of Iran and nuclear warfare
@WydenPress @RonWyden  Grateful and happy that @RyanWyden supports the Iran Deal. Our country needs legislators who understand diplomacy.
