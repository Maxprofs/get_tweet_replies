Yes, ALL Americans, NOT Illegals. WE want our children to have the safety and freedoms that we had as children.
I agree with you and am happy to hear. Will you also oppose Betsy De Vos? She is bad for our schools.
@SenSchumer Thank You, Senator!
@hrw Thank you for your courage to stand 
@PhotosbyScout Thank you!

Thank you!
Thank you for standing up.
@SenSchumer Well Ma'am maybe you and #FakeTearsChuckSchumer will be happy with not receiving reelection votes next time.

#sessionsconfirmation doesn't need ur vote 

he doesn't need either of your votes. He's too good of a man.
Thank you. I hope you mean that.
@SenSchumer Like Holder? Lynch? Where were u when these AG's were allowing Obama to violate the constitution?
@SenSchumer that seems very intolerant of you both. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  #MAGA #BuildThatWall #AmericaFirst
But you believe Chuck?
Bravo! So glad I donated to YOUR campaign!!
@SenSchumer and myself and tons of others promise you won't get our vote!!! Time to put your application in at Walmart!!
thank you
You will lose your next election for playing politics with cabinet members 
@jeffsessions is a good man
YOU are a pollitical hack.
Thank you so much, Senator!! We need this resolve in the Senate.
Are you kidding me? You actually have the gull to say that after Holder & Lynch?! You lady, are a complete joke.
are you up for reelection in 2018? I'd like to contribute to your opponent.
@SenSchumer Thank you Senators!
@hrw thank you for honoring our civil rights. Won't be forgotten.
I was going to move to WI just so I could vote for you, but now I'm not..nah...I wasn't going to move there
hypocrite , you stalling Sessions is for politics .
- and you are not protecting all Americans by your refusal to vote on any of President Trumps Cabinet picks.
I agree. This behavior is getting old. Actually making democrats look weak
You are going down the wrong road. @SenatorSessions has prove himself to be fair and just to ALL Americans.
#Sessions Sessions will be a great AG without yours or any other Democrat vote. You are not relevant.
@Dookofurl  Thank you!!!
@SenSchumer watched that video of you promotin travel ban last year next to you crying this year #priceless #hypocrite #Maga

@SenSchumer WE NEEDS PEOPLE WORKING IN The WHITEHOUSE . No more showing up and wasting time doing NOTHING
@SenSchumer you sir are the political problem. Acting like children and on our dime to boot. Grow up and act like men.
@SenSchumer The EO is Constitutional and legal, and if you don't know that then you have no business being in the Senate.
@FormerlyFormer @SenatorBaldwin @SenSchumer Just pandering to the liberals.
Both of you should move to Syria! You are traitors to this nation who voted for DJ TRUMP.
did you say that about Holder or Loretta Lynch?  was it political when she had the tarmac meeting with Bill?

@virginiawillis good for you Senator and thank you for doing the right thing
It sure can't be a democrat. Look at what we had under obama. Do u realize y u lost the election?
You are a big dummy! We pay your salary and you will get voted out 
Thank you! Keep taking strong stances and put on the pressure--your constituents have your back!
Thank you for standing your ground and voting against Sessions!
Thank you, Sen. Baldwin
@hrw great we appreciate it.    IT will help US  in 2018
@SenSchumer Sessions is a good man..He put TWO high ranking KKK behind bars for life.He will be better than THE PREVIOUS AG
