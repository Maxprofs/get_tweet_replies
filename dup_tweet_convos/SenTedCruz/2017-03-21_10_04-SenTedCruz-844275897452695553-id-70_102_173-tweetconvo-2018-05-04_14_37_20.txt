besides Garland didn't get in because the Democrats changed the rules.
Democrats changed rules when Bush was President to say a president can't nominated a justice in his last year.
Rules were changed doesn't  matter anyway Gorsuch is a shoe in anyway.
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @GorsuchFacts Sen Frankenstein needs to shut up can't stand the way he questioned people he's a jerk
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @GorsuchFacts evil hateful
@SenTedCruz  @GorsuchFacts Senator Smalley is a joke. His questions are funnier than anything he did on SNL #confirmgorsuch
Huge waste of time. Just grandstanding for the peeps.
@SenTedCruz  @GorsuchFacts  @alfranken sitting on the judiciary committee and is unfamiliar with "Scrivener's error" is a joke.

@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @GorsuchFacts Al Franken is a clown.

Senator Franken is rude. Let Judge G answer.
Massive Al Franken Scandal Rocks Washington

@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @GorsuchFacts Franken's right, he's not a lawyer but he's an idiot.
he has no place on SCOTUS.
crazy. Activism on bench goes one way only - left. An ORIGINALIST is an unpolitical choice
I have more questions now than I had this morning. WE DON'T need another corrupt puppet judge
Some portions seem to be rehearsed. Not right.
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @GorsuchFacts Al Franken should be taken out of office is a disgrace in the heck is he think he is
so far he's tuff but not personal. Keeps cutting G off when he tries to answer.
Here we go...attack w personal attacks disguised as questions. Rarely have I seen a senator so angry
Attacks to P45 administration, which is the real agenda n narrative of the Dems.
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @GorsuchFacts Sen Franken is on the attack.
