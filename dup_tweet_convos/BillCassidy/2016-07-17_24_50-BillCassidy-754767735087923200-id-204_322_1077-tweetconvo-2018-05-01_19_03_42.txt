@drewwest_press @BillCassidy We should not have to speak negatively of the police. The media should help make them reliable, honest
You would think so right?
the police could work in all our interests and help fight the NRA.
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
glad to see you've been educated through memes lime my boy
that's not true, everyone deserves constructive criticism, no one gets immunity. Everyone can improve
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
@Chr1sle1ner @FoxNews @BillCassidy NOW IS THE TIME TO SHOOT FIRST AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER. LET THEM LEARN WHEN TO CALL THE COPS
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
@mickeyyps27 @FoxNews @BillCassidy
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
I wholeheartedly disagree but, if u do it u shld at least be the truth.
- can you turn off sound on convention when you have speakers talking on tv shows like Hannity and O'Reilly?!! One or the other!!
just can't listen to Obama speak anymore. Makes me sick and angry.
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
People should not shoot cops
remember that POTUS and Beyoncé
amen brother #IrejectHATE #prayforpeace #BatonRouge #ThinBlueLine
Will Senator Cassidy be releasing a statement praising the heroism of the North Miami police? http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article90905442.html …
Obama has no business speaking to the American people. He is NOT one of us.
how dare you senator how dare you come out and support the man who's been fueling this fire against the police
I admire the work that police do. It's a tough job, but no one is above the law - including police officers.
... Really.... It's called freedom of speech.
police are not perfect as no one is and when they do something wrong they should be called out for it
We shouldn't assume the police are wrong, but no one deserves blind support. Good cops need to call out bad ones
"Should not speak negatively"... even if they did something negatively?! They are humans at end...
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
and by the way Senator the race War unfortunately has already started thanks2 politicians like you  Hillary and Obama
Police need to Stop.Not killing black people.
BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That should start with POTUS. Obama is supposed to be the nation's leader.
that stupid!  Everyone that has legal lethal force should be questioned and held accountable

what like @BarackObama did? I agree when the leader says dumb stuff cops get shot 
#PissedOffAmerican #TrumpPence16
what if they do bad stuff? They do bad shit sometimes bro.
No, but a healthy dose of skepticism is a good idea when dealing with government power.
Why not?  Obamanation, does!
@ROCKONDUDE2 @BillCassidy when comes Memorial 4 the 3 fallen officers, keep Obama out. He is anti-cops. Keep him away #BatonRouge
Sorry some cops are just racist and bring the racist attitude to work, then this idiot say we should not speak bad
- When the Police are restrained unjustly, then anarchy will be a rebuke to society. Romans 13
starting with POTUS
This is a stupid statement.  If something amiss people should speak up.  People should not call for harm to the police
why? The entire channel does it about teachers on a daily basis.
You must be talking about the media..
political correctness is killing people
@POTUS @BarackObama needs to keep his mouth shut. Just resign you miserable excuse for a president. On your hands.
JUST ABOUT DA 1'S DEY KILL
Well lets hope Obama doesn't throw in his little "EVERYONE IS RACIST" comment again (like he did at Dallas).
Get S. Smith off the air. He makes me sick. He's against cops and for BLM. Pandering to Obama and BLM. Can't stand him. Bias 
Someone please tell the @POTUS, that!
People will stop talking negativity about cops. When they stop shooting unarmed black kids.
S. Smith should apologize to Bobby J. Try doing that to Trump, he'll eat u up and spit u out. That's a why Trump is going to WIN!
Obama, a Muslim? I've heard everything. Don't say that if you aren't ready to hear "Trump the Nazi white supremacist."
Popohoes
Because all police are Great, impartial agents of Justice right. People talk about what They Live. #Justice4All
@BillCassid all this violence in America should stop  its bad for elections is bad for Hillary  running for the presidency STOP NOW
If you media outlets would quit showing hypocrisy & call right & wrong like it should then the blood is on your hands
When we can't criticize authority that's tyranny.
yes please let them understand
What an asinine thing to say. What an absolute sheep! Don't even criticize them when they deserve it?
looking for a way stop the truth from being exposed. We protest for  valid reason for humanity and fight against evil
lack of respect for law enforcement lack of respect for #POTUS. And Pres. Obama will be blamed #BatonRougeShooting
Actually, they should when it is merited. But not using lies, and inciting criminal acts. Stop #SorosWarOnCops
cops shouldn't aduse their power either!
the anti-government party picks and chooses which part of the government that they shower adoration on.
Unless America people protect cops in media and court, there won't be any cop left to protect people on the street.
most of these people thrive on the Satanic Verses. The Klan Doctrines are of Evil gestures. Nazis planted in country.
@LindaSuhler @BillCassidy The people are done listening to @POTUS.
Stop letting this man speak. He has done enough damage and is being sued for it. #Trump2016
WHY?
The Circle of Life. Urban terrorism sparks gun sales, registered guns are pawned or stolen.
????? so this guy doesn't believe in freedom of speech?  it's attitudes like that, that fuel movements like BLM.
protests against them should remain in effect. Think about what so-called police will be doing if all was not exposed
People shouldn't shot at the police. But they can say what they want. Freedom of speech isn't just for what you like
.@FoxNews @BillCassidy but I guess you'll ignore them because you don't respect the police yourselves
do you think our president will take your advise ???
this is not a solution, it's not helping, it's making things worse, but no police negativity isn't a solution.
.@FoxNews @BillCassidy the police in Cleveland want to suspend open carry during RNC because it's screwing with their policing
SHALL NOT COMPREHEND WAFFLE OBAMA HE SHALL NOT HAVE TV THAT LONG LOADS OF APOLOGY
they are plotted here to run this country from the inside.
Yeah! Fuck Freedom of Speech! Don't touch my guns!
shut up!
ISIS chanting death to Americans, Americans chanting death to COPS. Terrorism is Terrorism foreign or domestic.
they are drug addicts. They thrive on a culture of hate and evil.
People shd not fund BLM!
no speaks negative about police they are negative against anyone else. They rape, kill, mame, torture,
Yes you should if "some" Police are doing illegal, horrible things. No excuse 4 killing people though. Stop Guns 24/7
@FoxNews @BillCassidy

Never ever, there is a huge lack of respect for law enforcement.
never? Hmmmmm that sounds like a dictatorship regime where we must fall in line or get the axe. No chance
Law enforcement is our first line of defense.Crimes against them should be met with death penalty#martial law
Obama will briefly say killing cops is wrong, ramble forever about gun control, then invite BLM to White House for BBQ
...Can't wait for more of Obama's BS!!!!!
what's with shep smith chastising Bobby J. about using the phrase all lives matter?  Ailes should have a sit down with him. I'm mad
President started this to get a race war, so he can declare MARTIAL LAW. DO away with constitution and Bill rights.
we just half to find a way to give each other a chance to prove that.
Really man
: Sure hope BHO/BS doesn't step in fresh poop again & drag it across USA! If you don't have something nice to say then be silent!
I agree and our President needs to tell his black race to stop now. The president is to blame for this hatred.
Obama will give an executive order nationalizing the police and claim it will end racism
Obama Hellooooooooo I think he means you. Well at least I mean you.
@nhdogmom
Lets take bets on how long it takes him to switch to gun control he can't seem to help himself, I bet under 5 min
1st Amendment is honorable.  Inflammatory statements which perpetuates violence is ignorant.
Potus is an example of ignorance
We need cops. They are heroes.
But the bad cops give bad names, any group. They need to be weeded out. Not protected.
like i said all black men are not the cops enemy. Just like all cops are not the black mans enemy.
agree NEVER.If there R cops that do wrong allow the powers that b take action never citizens God bless these families.
Fox news is directly responsible 4 the police killings with the kind of people they out on their shows
YOU HEAR THAT OBAMA AND KILLERY
Our Nation has gone insane. Is Obama ever genuinely going to be upset that police are being killed? What will it take?
Yes and that includes @POTUS
this will give the officers a chance to interact with young black men in the committee thats a start
Are you kidding me? Since when do we decide to give an entire group immunity to criticism? @BillCassidy
As a whole, we shouldn't. Each situation needs to be treated with objectivity. Not assumptions and accusation
TOTALLY AGREE. A blanket statement like @BillCassidy suggests is wrong IMO. @FoxNews
I agree. These men and women go out everyday and protect us no matter what color anyone is. They are all heroes
Of course people should not do that, unless we are talking about those who shoot 1st, ask questions later
The same ppl who do are the same ones clapping for them when they're all out in force on July 4 th protecting us from Terrorists.
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
the cops MUST stand with the people .. They must for change to happen
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
The problem is the President has been speaking. About needing gun laws, not about the thugs doing the killing.
the police are not the problem. Our prez has caused problems from beginning.he only cares about thugs killed by police
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
It's sad we even have to tell people this, especially actual grown adults. It's called "right from wrong". Respect
all lives matter, the people who say that phrase bothers them are the ones  killing innocent Police officer BLM=murder
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
Tell Obama its to late, he created this mess. I have nothing but respect for local police. Thank you for all you do!
#WOW! All I #request of the #police is that they #START doing the #JOB they're #PAID big #MONEY 2 do. #CNN #FOXNEWS
there are good cops and very corrupt cops when the good cops start to arrest their own bad cops  ALL will change
Now curtailing "speech"? Are we in Iraq? #WTF
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
I know several police officers and shame on those that make negative statements against them.
#BatonRouge What happened to if ya see something say something
I see turmoil #chaos #gopconvention& #Hate speech coming from #TRUMP
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
BLM incites these crazies to go out & kill police. Enough already. Obama grow a pair & stand up!
POTUS needed to let investigation take place after policed killed suspects. Not speak out stirring up race. Awful.
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
#FireShepSmith
Like @BarackObama calling them racist? RT @FoxNews @BillCassidy: "People should not speak negatively about the police." #BatonRougeShooting
u don't want people 2 speak the truth about police LMFAO
@WSJ @IAMQUEENLATIFAH Educated police officers protect & serve. Uneducated kill & are protected via Malfeasance. @EW
People should not speak negatively about the police, African Americans, Whites, Mexicans, or anyone.
No free speech? How about go screw yourself?
Says a white guy !
I love how when you tell Americans to shut up about somethings they just get louder. Pretty cool
let's see what the HNIC says
You need to let Obama in on that message .
what about white kid cops shot -#dylannoble cops use of force unjustified .Cops out of control. We need accountability
we the people demand justice in America when a crime is committed by and officer .
i think they should bring back police committee station in all committees
its like working beside someone black the white man has to give the black man a chance to show him who he really is
cops shouldn't give political partisan speech in uniform like @SheriffClarke its disgraceful to men & women serving.
#coplivesmatter
isn't respected as Chief David Brown, because he's just a right-wing pundit.
chief brown is the man
MOST police do a wonderful job...of course the thugs of the world wanna yell and scream
Speaking negative about a policeman or anyone else for that matter and killing them is two entirely different things.
and police shouldn't be negative towards ppl they are always excessive when dealing with some1 they see as an other
-No one should speak negatively about the police when many of them are good people.
police should not be shot, killed or abused, horrific events yes but to suggest they should be above criticism, um no
starting with the POTUS!
.@FoxNews @BillCassidy .....so we can keep on MURDERING them that way" FAT CHANCE palehorse-media DEMONS
Yes don't criticize the thin blue line mafia that have killed more Americans than the Iraq and Afghan wars combined!
Police officers are NOT above the law and the constitution. When they exceed their authority they SHOULD BE criticized
Sir, do you believe ALL lives matter? Shep Smith thinks ALL is a divisive term. Do you agree?
@FoxNews @BillCassidy
I don't think that's the answer.
self censorship is not a democratic value. That's what they do in dictatorships and unelected regimes.
oh speak bout laws they have no idea bout... @ShepNewsTeam pick up a law book and read b4 u preach
"Pigs in a blanket...fry 'em like bacon!"
"Yo inna heap o' trouble boy"
that's not how the 1st Amendment works.
people should not have elected a street hustling rabble rouser
Ever?
. Yes they should.. watch
Tell the President that.
lol like, at all?
yes like at all. Got a problem? Move out
so if a cop kills your brother, how do you express feelings, while being positive? Lol
