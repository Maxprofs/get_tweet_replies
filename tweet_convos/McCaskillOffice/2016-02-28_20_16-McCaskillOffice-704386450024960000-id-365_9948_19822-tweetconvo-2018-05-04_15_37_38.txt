@VP @ladygaga  instead of standing with gaga why don't you get serious and stand with Hillary before a republican becomes your successor
@VP @ladygaga bless you for using a huge forum to bring a real issue into powerful view in such a moving and compassionate way.
@VP @scollan_ruth @ladygaga If only you guys weren't using dishonest statistics.
@TGBED8v8 @VP @ladygaga 
What level of sexual assault is ok w/you? Where are your comfort stats? One is too many, don't agree, exit my TL 
@scollan_ruth @VP @ladygaga That's true. Punish the monsters that do it. In a fair trial. Rapists deserve the death penalty.
@TGBED8v8 @VP @ladygaga 
No one deserves the death penalty. It's a barbaric act that has no place in criminal justice, not in any 1st world
@scollan_ruth I have no problem with it. The scum of the Earth do not deserve to breathe the same air we do.
@VP @ladygaga
