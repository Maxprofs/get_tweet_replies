@ggreenwald @chryssi @clairecmc Glenn, you asked where Democrats are on Ferguson?
@CartoonistCobra @ggreenwald @chryssi @clairecmc on day 5? That's nothing to be proud of! This should have been a day one response. j.s.
@Ms_Brina @ggreenwald @chryssi @clairecmc As opposed to who else involving a matter like this? Give me the comparative figures. Name NAMES.
@CartoonistCobra @ggreenwald @chryssi @clairecmc that's the problem! No politician, including Democratic reps. Have stepped up until today.
@Ms_Brina @ggreenwald @chryssi @clairecmc Missouri State Senator  Maria Chappelle-Nadal (D) was on the front lines.
@CartoonistCobra @ggreenwald @chryssi @clairecmc I am aware of that... Let me restate... Nationally elected officials! Including @clairecmc

@CartoonistCobra @ggreenwald @chryssi LOL not fighting. Nothing but love! I don't believe @clairecmc should be give a complete pass...
@chryssi @clairecmc The DEAD has finally risen!  It's about time McCaskill, Clay, Nixon and other MO politicans said and did SOMETHING.
@chryssi @clairecmc  Oh! Oh! I'm ready for my close up, Mr Demille. Let me hug for the camera to make folks think I care. #Ferguson

Glad US. Sen @clairecmc is there! "@chryssi: .@clairecmc comforting a young protester in #Ferguson ”
