@SenSchumer 
Young adults need to get going by 18-21. Not up to 26. Yes, repeal and replace.
so, when doctors are in medical school they shouldn't have insurance? Got it.
They should pay for their own. Not my tax dollars.
...good job with insurance to be insured. This part of the law gives her a chance.
Makes sense for kids to be on their parents plan up to a certain age. I think 21-22, not 26.
I don't know if you don't know how college and graduate education works, or you just don't care
I paid for my own college expenses and worked weekends and summers. Today's kids are spoon fd
and it probably saves you money by lowering your premium bc young ppl in your pool
@SenSchumer These are both provisions Trump has already said would be in any new plan. Telling a lie doesn't make it so.
This is totally false. Stop lying to American people.
UR both liars. Do U even care how Americans R suffering w/ outrageous premiums. 10K deductible isn't insurance.
U don't care abt Americans just politics. STOP SPREADING LIES. Work to make things better. STOP FEAR MONGERING.
MORE FAKE NEWS
@SenSchumer hey Chuck, if O-care is so awesome, feel free to give it a try.
@SenSchumer  Can someone explain McCain and Graham's decision to vote for Tillerson?

Stop telling lies. Pre-existing and parental coverage have always been in Repub proposals. You are the problem.
This is the most moronic ad ever & by these two no less, not surprised.

@McCaskillOffice @SenSchumer
Young adults being removed from their parents’ insurance. Americans w/ pre-existing conditions being denied coverage. #ChaosIsComing 
This is inappropriate behavior for an elected official.  Please consider your tweets more carefully.
@SenSchumer lies as usual coming out of your AmErican mouth..
@SenSchumer You don't know that. You are just assuming the worst and spreading fear for your own purposes.
its a sinking ship!
@SenSchumer Baloney and you know it!
Try a new plan that's actually affordable and not mandatory
@SenSchumer COMPLETE BS!
High-risk pools will codify discrimination against people w/ preexisting conditions. Fight Paul Ryan's plans.
fear mongerer..
Liberal Propaganda, Stop lying to the American people. ACA always bad policy and collapsing on its own. @McCaskillOffice @SenSchumer
@SenSchumer That's the Trump and GOP way to treat not wealthy citizens. If they could they would sen old and sick away
You're another one that needs to buy a TV and see what you are saying is B.S. Not even going to happen.
@SenSchumer lies,lies and more lies you Dems made a huge mess out of our health care system shut up and go away
@SenSchumer shame that you spread this disinformation.  Get over it.
only reason to repeal now w/out replacement is to benefit biz & wealthy; they r irresponsible & unprepared for what is next
@SenSchumer lies!! You liberals are such liars!! Grow up Chuckie
They kicked my friend off his insurance but took his premium what gives?
@SenSchumer lost last chance to make a mark to help Americans󾓦just set back and say by by.@realDonaldTrump  is inspired

@SenSchumer hey McCaskill Office enjoy your last two years.
U guys should have been aggressively  running ads about this Way before the election.
@SenSchumer chaos is stirred up by people like you. Remember we Missourians elected u and can do a lot better.
@SenSchumer What will you say when Trump's policies absolutely Rock?
@SenSchumer 34 States put DJT in the WH. Keep this stuff up and in 20 it will be 38. You people do not get Middle America!
BULL BULL BULL-HOW about WAITING until the plan is prepared and shown BEFORE YOU START SCREAMING YOU LIES
@SenSchumer these two Senators are like the kid running into town screaming wolf. Have no clue what replacement will be!
the interesting thing is most of you in the Senate could not do the jobs of those you are grilling. Really bad!
@SenSchumer 

You don't know what you've got until it is gone.

Keep up the good work, senator.
you know this is s #LIE!!
@SenSchumer How horrible to govern by fear and the illusion of chaos..I would have expected more from you both
Trump ran his whole campaign on fear. He's done a good job manipulating people such as you.
HA! Trump ran on TRUTH!
I'm sorry that you think that. We are exercising our rights. T is corrupt.
pretends to care when 100's of thousands in MO are still uninsured. @RoyBluntMO has great insurance. You @SenSchumer?
@SenSchumer @McCaskillOffice Price may have given it away. Old Republican dodge: meaningless access versus really available coverage. Bad!!!
@yenaaldlooskii
@SenSchumer there is no need to replace. Use Medicaid. Stop building broken bureaucracies.
Ms.McCaskil, I hope you & Mr. Schumer realize that you are part of the swamp that needs drained. Paritsan BS
The swamp is moving in as we speak. HATER! It's hard to have respect for people who voted for a bigot
the bigot was Obama who hated whites but wanted to be one!!!
@SenSchumer
Trump's will be the worst. However, Obama had to clean up the mess Bush Jr made.
@SenSchumer YOU BETTER FIGHT HARD FOR US CLAIRE!!!!! Punch Mr. Blunt REALLY hard when next you see him from me!
@SenSchumer you have already created chaos chuckie boy.
more fake news
@SenSchumer
Ha ha, do your stupid constituents really fall for your nonsense?  They must since you keep pushing fake issues.
right on trackI can say that because I'm not influenced by my constituents I make my way hardGod bless you
@SenSchumer that's all lies. U guys are dividing America and spreading hate.
Do you know for sure this is going to happen or are you joining the rest of liberals and making stuff up?
