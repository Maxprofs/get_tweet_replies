You mean no guns for law abiding Americans. #filibuster
On the path to disarming one and all....  @jde4zion @clairecmc 
#fillibuster
Terrorists are already prohibited from owning a gun in America.But lets not let a spoil a political opportunity huh?
Glad you see through the BS, J.D.  @jde4zion
Folks like you who would do nothing are sad-narrow minded people.  No one wants "your" guns.
limiting guns IS doing nothing. Only stupid people think it is something. @lindarutter @jde4zion
Good grammar! Check increase in number of mass murders since GOP let assault rife ban expire.
Check the number of "assault weapons" deaths compared to pistols or shotguns.
Good step but not enough-if this is all that happens NRA still big winner-need expanded background checks, assault weapons ban
Thanks for your effort.
the Muslim terrorist in orlando shooting wasn't on a terror watch list. And wasn't a known terrorist. So how will you know?
Says the semi conservative democrat. Here here! You can be both, people. You can be both.
yeah that's cool but background checks and assault weapons ban should be priority
how about ...no terrorist period.  What don't you all get....
@madamgeri.  THANK YO < !!!

Thank you so much, Senator McCaskill.
We need a ban on the sale of assault and tactical weapons to civilians. #guncontrol
@MarcVegan It's crazy that we even have a filibuster about that. Guns for terrorists? That's a big WTF?!
Thanks to you and your staff for this!! If you see Sen. Blunt, give him a frosty stare for this Boone Cty voter.  1.4M from NRA
Thank you, go get 'em @clairecmc
#filibuster #Enough Thank you, Senator!!

No assault weapons for any civilian. I say that as a veteran & a retired LEO!
@inglamwetrust We're proud of all of you. Too bad Bernie wasn't helping.
thank you for your service tell the GOP Americans have said enough is enough we will vote out politicians in the NRA pockets
Thank you Think of the amazing things 20 6yr olds might have accomplished if not murdered by an assault weapon #GunControlNow

SO GLAD we lived in STL for a bit and I got to vote for you! Give 'em hell!!!
if you think terrorist & criminals care about "gun laws", then you're dumber than the people who voted 4 u.  #OrlandoShooting
thank you for joining the #filibuster Missouri needs leadership on this issue as much as the rest of the country! #Enough
this Missourian thanks you!
thank you, Senator. Please stand up against the NRA & fight for stricter gun control.
Terrorists couldn't get guns if you would charge them with actual crimes instead of putting on a useless list.
Go Claire!  Proud you're my Senator!
Please provide a way for wrongfully accused to get off the no fly list. #EqualRights4All
Thank you.
.@clairecmc  Thank you!! #filibuster #gunsense
just enforce all existing laws.
Yes! Thank you for your commitment to helping to ensure our safety.
have fun with that. #NRA #2ndAmendment #gunssavelives
thank you!!
Thank you. @RoyBlunt will you cross the party line and add your voice for common sense gun legislation?
@RedwoodGirl but they are only a tiny part of the problem - majority of mass murders are white male christians - what about them?
@RedwoodGirl Keep the filibuster going, get the message out, we're mad as shell & not going to take it anymore.
@SenateDems Thank you! Convince your colleagues to stay united.  This can be done if they don't back down.
thank you!!
From STL, thank you!
Thank you!!!
that's great and all but where does due process come in? U haven't researched this very well have u
thank you from a proud constituent!
You Go Girl!  Proud to be a Democrat today.  Stand strong!
thank you for standing up #filibuster
THAAAAAANK YOOOOOUUUUU!!!!!!  #filibuster #gunsense

Thank you Senator.
You go, Senator.  You are one of my heroes.
Go for us! Thank u! We the people r with u! #filibuster #holdthefloor
no we the people are not.
@EstoyConHillary  Thank you Democrats
@sanderswinsbig BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. You're missing the point! This was a hate crime against LGBTQ community, NOT terrorism.
Thank you!
Thank you
stop racializing the fact that Congress has failed repeatedly to regulate guns due to campaign contributions.
@SenateDems Thank you, thank you, thank you! You give scared parents hope.
Can you please try to wrap your head around something called "due process"?  Please, come up with a solution and quit posturing.
I can't wait to hear!!!
Pardon my French, but you're an idiot.  What part of "secret lists" and "no Constitutional due process" don't you understand?
Thank you!
Define 'terrorist' please.
Really? You back Clinton who armed the worst authoritarian regimes in the world in return for bribes?
#MonetizingTheWhiteHouse
Love you Claire!!  Thank you!
thank you for representing Missouri in this important cause! Stay strong!
@AnitaNelson 
Restrictions on fully automatic weapons can & should be extended to cover assault rifles, w.o. changing #2nd A.
That's an Oxy-Moron who wants terrorist to have guns! Just another political distraction from reality.
Thank you! Great #filibuster question!  Please don't stop there.  #Enough
thank you Senator. My wife and I are cheering you and your colleagues on. #CommonSenseGunLaws #EndGunViolence
@SenateDems Thanks  and please keep it up. This is too important to once again do nothing.
You were an inspiration. Sending you gratitude from Kansas.
thank you Senator!
THANK YOU!!!

Thank you! As a member of a multiple-gun-owning family, I fully support the common sense gun control measures proposed by dems!!
how about no terrorists? Remember - Timothy McVeigh didn't need one. The 9/11 terrorists didn't need one. Focus on real problem.
@kcblueDEMinKS  Take Republican @RoyBlunt from Missouri and make him watch how it's done....
@AlexKGonzalez Laws only keepcitizens from obtaining firearm-criminals operate under radar!Hence,unarmed pop. Is defenseless pop!
LOL. Let's not address the real problem, let's just ban all the things
YES!! THANK YOU!!! It's about time!! #filibuster
Thank you, @clairecmc, for standing up to @NRA. It takes guts. #fillibuster #Enough #gunsense
give them hell.  #filibuster #WheresBernie
go get em girl!
Thank you!!
hurry up Claire
Or anyone else, apparently. Gotta love gun control--putting the power back in the hands of the elite for centuries.
you were brilliant. Thank you for your tireless work.
Way to go! Thank you, Senator McCaskill. This Missouri R is happy to hear this.
that's so undemocratic and partisan which is CLEARLY the way to decrease congressional political gridlock
this is after they are brought to trial and convicted right? Or are you advocating the suspension of the bill of rights?
Thank you. Were behind you
thank you, it is beyond time!
I watched from London. You were marvellous.
Thank you! Let's make a difference and stop this injustice. I'm so proud of what you're doing! 
thank you for standing during this filibuster. I am proud you are our senator. #iscreamforchange
@Bipartisanism How about no terrorist in the @WhiteHouse ! #VetOurGov #NoCairInOurGov #VetOurGov #VetOurGov #VetOurGov #VetOurGov
thank you! #Enough #filibuster
Thank you - you were awesome!
You can try to change the law. But determined criminals only obey the laws of physics - which allow this:

THANK YOU!!! #filibuster
can't we simplify this and just keep out the Muslim crazies? Or are good Americans going to pay the price again and again?
Thank you Senator!! We support you.

YOU ARE AWESOME. Amazing speech, thank you. #filibuster #EnoughIsEnough #Enough #EnoughGunViolence @SenateDems
Proud of you!
Can you help with the filibuster for LGBT rights... since, you know, WE were the ones attacked?
Yes, they (Republicans) are afraid of the #NRA because the #NRA feeds them $$$$$$$$.
way to crush it Claire!   Our children and teenagers are afraid of dangerous Americans with easy access to weapons of war
Go Claire! Rock it!
thank you.

Thank you for sharing that voicemail, and for your address. #Enough
