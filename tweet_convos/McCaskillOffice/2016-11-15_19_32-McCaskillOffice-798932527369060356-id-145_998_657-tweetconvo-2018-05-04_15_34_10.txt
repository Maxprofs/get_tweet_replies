@glennbeck this will be a big mistake in my opinion. My belief public hates earmarks and Bill additions that are non related.
I am done with the GOP if
they'll never learn #idiots
@glennbeck guess they don't want to stay there long !!
SMH!
@realDonaldTrump Can't Trump stop this?
@bummer32 @edsaker  good video
stop the vote now
I guess they R waiting to see who has the worst ear mark requests and they will be chosen for drainage? 
@UpInTheHills   Wake up guys you are there to represent We the people don't be stupid!
get the names, remember when election comes again.
@glennbeck @realDonaldTrump   I hope they stop this!
@glennbeck this is why Glenn's come together bs needs to change into an ardent will to identify and defeat ones enemy
Perhaps Glenn has lost his will to fight a hard fight
@glennbeck How can Paul Ryan let this even go to a vote?
Endless stupidity and greed.
another reason to support COS Article V
no earmarks!
Are they total idiots?
@glennbeck So sad  they just can't stop themselves!
@RepSteveChabot, @WarrenDavidson and @RepBradWenstrup please vote against overturning the ban on earmarks! @Heritage
The other question is, why is this vote being done w/ a secret ballot?! @Heritage
This won't end well.
I am done with
Disgusting! Have not learned #TheirLesson!
@glennbeck NO wonder people don't trust Republican, this is your last chance
This is the first time I have ever agreed with the Heritage Foundation.  I'm actually scared about that!
@glennbeck your country is about to get looted like a Best Buy during a summer blackout. The other side saw this coming.
@glennbeck typical get our votes then drop us like hot potatoes, what a bunch of losers.
@jasoninthehouse your vote better be against earmarks
continue of corruption of politics, shows they didn't get the voters message.
@glennbeck same old song & dance..will we ever learn not to trust the GOP? No difference from DNC
Ryan stops vote on bringing back earmarks http://www.thehill.com/homenews/house/306443-ryan-stops-vote-on-bringing-back-earmarks …
and this is surprising NOT
ear marks cause bad policy to get passed and good policy to get shot down
drain the swamp. We are watching!
Please tell me this is a fake story. They can't possibly be this stupid.
ugh why do they not learn?
When are these churn heads going to get it? We just voted to remove all possible paths to corruption. CAN YOU HEAR US?
Get it together guys or you will be drained with the rest of the swamp.
So very right and wise.
DO NOT DO IT!
It seems they have not heard the American people yet!
Something more to overturn. Add it to the list. Swamp water.
I hope this is not passed. It's wrong!
didn't I say is the RNC vs TEA
The 'old guard' still calling shots. McCain/McConnel, etc.
they are elitist. jus like a liberal
Yank out all those shady earmarks. One issue per vill. No pork. No earmarks.  Wash. Knows this bur they do it anyway.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO CONTACT THEIR CONGRESS PEOPLE & SAY NO
falling right off of the wagon. They can't handle earmarks. We need a return to normal budgeting process. It's in job description
Just more of the swamp that needs draining
U might encourage people to FB or Tweet @SpeakerRyan to let Congress know, respectfully,  their feelings about Gov't spending
@catalishus2 Look for graft, corruption and deficits on a massive scale.
Why is it secret? Now find out how everyone voted. We hack everything http://else.How  about something that matters.
it's like a stab in the back
they all need to go home and shutup until Jan. 20th, just like #POTUS Obama, he can pack and get out of dodge, lame duck...
So an open public vote would do the trick?? Explain please.
Don't blame Trump... as far as I know it's still Obama in there!
Why would Heritage Foundation support RINOs like the Bush folks to name? Y'all lost me years ago
Why do u support Free Trade Agreements which destroy American jobs & shut down American manufacturing?  Y'all kicked USA 2 curb!!!
@TeriGRight Earmarks still need to be banned & cut grant programs 50%. (Remember the grant to teach elephants to detect bombs?)
ugh Jesus....
same as usual Congress working hard to line their pockets at the expense of hard working taxpayers
what do you expect when folks elect the same congress members? That is not change.

hmmm
If I recall, earmarks had to be pried from Mitch McConnell's crony fingers. This is outrageous. #RinosMustGo
@KurtSchlichter That was the other guy's swamp that's gonna get drained. 
Business as usual. 
Very promising boys!
One mans swamp is another’s endangered waterfowl estuary wetland nature preserve.
No ducks in those swamps but plenty of foul
@KurtSchlichter This needs to STOP
We need a line item veto/balanced budget Constitutional Amendment
@KurtSchlichter they are doing it to flood fall congress with bills
surely you're not surprised
@rdr70024 If politicians thumb their noses at the people once again they will have a much bigger problem than DJT..a revolution...
SO right about that!
I am not so worried about Pres Trump.. but the Republicans and Dems running interference.
Yes, I know what you're saying. He has to watch out for them!
There are many snakes in the grass when you drain a swamp..
and if you disagree?
@MichaelaTHF how's that swamp draining going for you? Oh they're adding more alligators? How surprising! Shocked I say, shocked.
You are funny Pat.
@kksheld I wonder who predicted this @cnstitutionprty
no secret ballot, no ear marks
@SpeakerRyan @Reince This better not go through & it will show what kind of start you want for the new President.  America voted.
@realDonaldTrump Who are the "some" Republicans? I would like to address them personally #draintheswamp #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Considering we DOUBLED the national debt since hussein was installed by Soros &the gang the focus is a little bigger than earmarks
start making decisions that are not focused on personal projects! Get it right, do it now!
@RepMikeTurner Please vote to keep the ban @RepMikeTurner

TELL US WHO VOTEED FOR EARMARKS. AND WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THEM
@CNCKSTER They are voting secret ballot so they can all lie to us and say they voted against itm
vote values not earmarks
@GOP @realDonaldTrump  KNOW...we the people...are watching..DRAIN THE SWAMP..stop these shenanigans..this is WHY you were elected.
apparently the swamp didn't get the message...#facepalm
They better not.  We are watching.
what is the matter with these jackasses!
Perhaps POTUS 45 will be more swift to use the veto pen than 43. All reps are up in 2 years and another 1/3 of Sen.
Name them
Shame them
Blame them
Then kick them out .
Note to Congress: You might want to rethink that.
can they have truly missed the election? This is an outrage. #NewParty
SECRET ballot?   What, they are afraid to STAND by their vote??
TAR AND FEATHER THESE AZZHOLES.
@cfrasher1 
They better not@speakerpaulryan@amrightnow
If Ryan puts this through we must get rid of him. Doing in secret vote NO.
I hope pres-elect Trump exposes their scandalous special interest. Drain the swamp.
I was for removing them,  but on balance I think they are useful.  There has to be some selfish foundation for deal making.
VOTE OUT THE ESTABLISHMENT !!!!!!!!
Yeah, I don't wanna pay for any cowboy poetry.
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz I want you all to vote against this (no earmarks!) as my senators.  Don't act like democrats!
should never b earmarks 4 any rep r state that money never goes 2 a good thing & that money could b used 2 pay off debt good thing
they need to realize that we  voters can do it again!
#draintheswamp
Obama used 1 trillion in his campaign for presidency.Thats why the ban came around.So no 1 could take advantage like tht in future
why is this secret ballot?
hopefully Trump will stomp on this crap.
Secret ballots should be outlawed ...it undermines trust in government, it's a vehicle to say one thing and do another.
I want the list of those who sponsor the Bill.
please  we need  to  listen  to  others, compromise with  others  and  work  hard  for  all  Americans  Latinos  for  Trump  MAGA!
Well it looks like that whole, "drain the swamp" thing was a hoax. Looks like the establishment is well established.

Are earmarks helpful to have elected reps direct govt services rather than DC bureaucrats? I'm all for that as a conservative.
Some Republicans are already getting it wrong
Vote tomorrow to end #earmarks ban by Congress=Secret Ballot
 @Heritage
vote #no on earmarks This is part of what we are fighting against.
Booooo....here we go.  They just can't stay out of their own way.
Fire Everyone,  Start over
You built this.
.@Heritage Secret ballot has its (rare) place. And earmarks are deciding where money goes; they're fine. The big problem is omnibus bills!
@realDonaldTrump will set them right.  If not, America will.  #MakeCongressGreatAgain
Drain the swamp #draintheswamp
