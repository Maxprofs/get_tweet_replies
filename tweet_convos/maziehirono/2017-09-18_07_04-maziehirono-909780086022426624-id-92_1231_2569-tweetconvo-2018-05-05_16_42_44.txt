Give Em Hell, Senator !
Aloha, Senator! Thank you from Arkansas for all you do to #SaveOurCare
@IntentionalFood New Day. Start making those senators McCain Murkowski Collins Paul. Keep calling every day. Need Hearings
Folks in AZ, AK, ME, KY: We can't call for you. Please take a moment to let these folks know you want sane healthcare, not partisan might.
call from red states. Ask for Hearings and scoring of bill B4 they just pass it blindly. Amer lives at stake
Yes! When you call, demand CBO scoring. Costs (not lives) are the only way to appeal to these partisan hacks.
ask for Hearings and CBO scoring on trumpcare. Senators should not make decision W/O it. red senators

#KillTheBill  NO to Trumpcare
I speak for our most vulnerable population, people with intellectual disabilities, including my son
McCain already said he'd support it. It's done. What a joke.
Stop these monsters! This Congress had no hearings ,discussions or anything about this bill that will harm and in some cases kill American
Trump is doing the obfuscation thing with NFL, picking on widows, to hide the $1.5 Trillion cut in medicare/medicaid. And you rock.
They think re-wording the language on preexisting conditions is going to fool us. They are so wrong!
Thank you, Senator Hirono. We are supporting you all, to defeat, 
Trumpcare and trump too.
We will defeat it as one big movement. Together we will defeat this bill!
Thank you Senator for standing against #GrahamCassidy Please do ALL you can to derail/stall any vote! #SaveACA
Thank you for defending ACA.
Mahalo Senator! Please take care of your health 

Please get @EnergyDems behind trying to kill this: https://twitter.com/indivisiblenwfl/status/908528142461128704 â€¦
NWFL is NOT in agreement, it benefits 6k while stealing from 300k
@Maddow @MaddowBlog @SteveBenen @CoryGn @Oleta @TriciaMcKinney @WillAtWork Please watch! There is a massive land grab in Congress S. 1073 
PLEASE SENATOR DO NOT LET THIS HORRIFIC BILL PASS!! IT WILL DEVASTATE AMERICANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE WITH PRE-EXISTING HEALTH ISSUES!
Thank you @maziehirono and @SenateDems for you work.
Health insurance (ACA) isn't Healthcare.  #REPEALACANOW
#RepealACAnow
Thank you.
With your help trumpcare will not pass and allow Obamacare to collapse that is the better choice
And that's the truth!
Another bad healthcare bill #KillTheBill
"Proudly serving the people of Hawaii", while you have subsidized healthcare. You're a joke and an embarrassment!
So what is your plan?
How bout working as hard to follow ACA as written? #RemoveExemption Congress should feel the same pain y'all inflicted on The People.
So we add a little "sour" to a new proposal and change the idiots name on it and call it a health care bill? Are you freaking kidding me!
You people have doen NOTHING to even isure proper healthcare for our 2-3% American veteran population in need. You are IMPOTENT!
This isn't an attempt at health care. This is an attempt at murder. The GOP will rot in hell. #good riddance #evil
Democrats have failed 
 especially in Hawaii.ACA is scrap not affordable and 1 choice.pathetic
Mahalo Senator! it's not about trump. don't lose sight of the real prize, affordable full health care for all rich or poor
What? take an economics class please
As usual @TheDemocrats oppose anything to save American healthcare. Must keep disastrous Obamacare.
You didn't defeat the first time. McCain did that.  Although guess you could say he is more democrat than republican.
