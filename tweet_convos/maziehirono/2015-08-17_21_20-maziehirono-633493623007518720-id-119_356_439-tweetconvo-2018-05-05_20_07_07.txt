@UrbnConservativ I'll tweet you when Bush beats Cruz. Enjoy :-)
@maziehirono Did you state that you actually read the entire deal? I did not get that from your statement.
Thank you Senator Mazie Hirono @maziehirono for your decision to side with #peace and #hope for Iranian people #SupportIranDeal
@maziehirono excellent! The correct choice
@maziehirono @Mama4Obama1 Thank you for supporting the #IranDeal Senator Mazie Hirono
@maziehirono @MoveOn you traitor!
@maziehirono @NegarMortazavi No consideration other than how long her political career could advance if DNC did not approve a counter vote
Thank you @maziehirono for making the right choice and #SupportIranDeal and putting U.S. national interests first.
@maziehirono CANNOT understand your agreement to give Terrorist sponsoring nation $150B as they chant "Death to Israel! Death to America"
Nail meets Coffin.
Either you @maziehirono were threatened or bribed with favors for the support.
@maziehirono Dems must insist Obama help rebels dump Assad and not allow Iran/Putini role afterwards or we stay home again in 2016--AzDem
@maziehirono @iSheyman So then you think that #IRANIAN "inspectors" will honestly "inspect" #Iran's nuke program??  #CaptainObvious says NO!
@maziehirono Shame on you Senator 4 voting 4 BAD #IranDeal >It will hasten nukes for Iran not halt them>Country BEFORE party
@maziehirono   THE ALTURNATIVE IS NOT WAR ..... However voting for this Deal ..will for sure be War .....
@maziehirono Were you aware of all the side deals made? Was that the classified part. Did you weigh that in your decision?
@maziehirono You really need to think about this again.  We have cut a deal without honor since they still hold Americans there.
@maziehirono @NegarMortazavi
Iran is the largest state-sponsor of terrorism. Call @SenatorCardin and tell him to stop the bad Iran deal.
@maziehirono Hopefully you took into consideration Iranians are doing their own inspections
@maziehirono @whatisworking11 Thank you Senator Hirono!!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse did you consider this Mazie?  Are u that Naive?  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a9f4e40803924a8ab4c61cb65b2b2bb3/ap-exclusive-un-let-iran-inspect-alleged-nuke-work-site …
@maziehirono Thanks for supporting peaceful ways
@maziehirono @Smilingl8dy Most excellent!
@maziehirono thanks for standing up for the Iran nuke deal.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse $150 billion Dollars to and allowing #Iran to have Nuclear capability is equivalent to #Insanity. #Feed the poor.!!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Mr. PRESIDENT,  what about the future?  There won't be one for your grandchildren #Iran Deal is so disturbing.
@maziehirono Please stop this Iran Deal!  Especially while they are holding innocent Americans in prison.  And we can't afford
@maziehirono I am concerned with your position. Your reasons seemed to be very lacking and vague. What would be classified by this deal?
@maziehirono Which constitutional power did congress use 2 acquire Hawaii?http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/100488-doj-legal.pdf …<p.21 https://twitter.com/DeSouzaDennis/status/633812864998903812 … #WeAreMaunakea
It is my #thesis that it is #unconstitutional to insist that #Hawaii is legally the 50th state.It would develop further: ENEMY of @StateDept
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse keep taking those drugs -
@maziehirono Unless Obama ousts Assad before Iran's cash arrives, my wife & I (2-time Obama voters) will boycott the 2016 election.
@maziehirono @NegarMortazavi Not enough people 've been killed by the Holy Regime of the Islamic Republic, we must support His Holiness Agha
@maziehirono @MoveOn i hope you do support the Iran deal
@maziehirono   Thank you for supporting peace over war
@maziehirono @Beverlyb11 Its disappointing that it took you so long 2 respect the incredible hard work this President has done on this deal!
@maziehirono TY Senator for your commitment to peace and common sense. #IranDeal
@maziehirono @WhiteHouA gud deal f only Iran culd allow d IAEA gain full access 2 evaluate/monitor d developement of its nuclear facilities.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse just because it's "our best option" doesn't make it right!
@maziehirono @ChemiShalev You will be on the right side of history, Mazie.  Republicans will regret the day they invaded Iraq!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse your hand must be stuck between two layers of peanut butter what's the matter with you those people are evil
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse félicitation excellent choix
@maziehirono As expected*  "Et tu, Brute?"  You have turned traitor against the beloved nation of Israel*
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse your an idiot
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse this will come back to bite you in the butt what you going to do if @realDonaldTrump Donald is elected?
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse you are out of your mind. All it does is give Iran the capabilities of being a global nuclear threat/terror.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Good seeing Senators make good choices. This is excellent news!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse so w give them back billions of $ so they can buy one from Russia    How stupid
@maziehirono thank you, let's give peace a chance (it might catch on)
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Excellent!  I agree.
@maziehirono thank you!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse good got you!!!!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse 
What about ISREAL nuclear program
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse sometime the best option is not an option at all
@maziehirono you are clearly delusional
.@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Another fricken genius - how do these ppl get elected....
@maziehirono the casualties caused by an Iranian nuke, dirty bomb, or Iran sponsored terrorism this deal WILL cause will be your fault, then
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse that iran deal isn't going to help. Btw! We "don't" negotiate with terrorists. Remember? Damn
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse You mean after political pressure from @potus? It's sad only 2 dems have the gut's to do the right thing!
@maziehirono http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran/Iranian-official-Tehran-to-sign-deal-with-Russia-for-advanced-S-300-missile-system-next-week-412449@WhiteHouse …
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Brilliant move Senator
@maziehirono Thank you for supporting this deal!
@maziehirono an excellent decision for all of us.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse 
#READ IT BEFORE YOU SIGN IT. IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT ASK A CONSERVATIVE ISRAELI.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse when they break this shit deal, we will remember
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse may you be voted out of office.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Why would any American do anything to support Iran at any time? Jeopardizing Israel and US!
@maziehirono just FYI, Iran does not have a nuclear WEAPONS program. Just nuclear program. That's a terrible mistake to make!!!
@maziehirono Thank you, Senator.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse:A very wise decision. Mazie is truthful 2 her oath & supports the deal that gives US/Israel/world the best option!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse As one who once worked at the UN and watched the grand effort required by diplomacy - you make a wise choice.
@maziehirono I totally agree.
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Lady, are you kidding so you will be in that bunch they will renege on when they blow the rest of us up.
@maziehirono Thank you Senator Hirono for choosing to stand on the right side of history
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse who the hell elected you how did you get elected no one else ran or something?  Opinion time: low life lefty looser
@maziehirono thank you for choosing #Peace senator!
@maziehirono @WhiteHouse Thank you, Senator Hirono.
@maziehirono @MoveOn: Easy to say when #Iran probably cannot hit #Hawaii with a nuclear bomb?
@maziehirono Thank you for supporting the #IranDeal and for giving a diplomatic solution a chance.
.@maziehirono @WinWithoutWar That's great and all, but Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapons program. It's civilian, already Safeguarded.
@maziehirono @WinWithoutWar Thank U. Sanctions wked, IRAN came to the table and OBAMA, Kerry & Dr. Moniz made the best of the opportunity.
@maziehirono @MoveOn thank you ! #NoWarWithIran
@maziehirono 
Smart lady.
@maziehirono @MoveOn As a Liberal I'm appalled at yr lack o wisdom &company line. Iran's unstable Verification?Enforcement w/out war?#NoDeal
It's lucky to be living on an island in the pacific I suppose. Indebted to Obama much? #IranDeal @maziehirono
@maziehirono Please read my open letter to @SenSchumer & ask him why he is enabling both Iran & ISIS obtain nukes http://themessinglink.com/Schumer 
Thank you @maziehirono U wrote a well-reasoned letter backing your decision. 1/2
@maziehirono Thank you, Mazie, for your wise decision! #GivePeaceAChance
@maziehirono mahalo!
@maziehirono @MoveOn Thank you.You laid out a good arguement for supporting the Iran deal.It is a good deal & no other deal can prevent war.
@maziehirono Great news! Thank you Senator Hirono! #IranDeal #NoWarWithIran
Great, thanks for choosing the peace. @maziehirono
@maziehirono @MoveOn Thank you for coming to the right decision on the #IranDeal.
@maziehirono @MoveOn Idiot...
@maziehirono there's another way to halt irans nuclear weapon ambition.
@maziehirono Thank you, senator.
@maziehirono @admiralmpj Thank you, Senator Hirono, for voting for peace.
@maziehirono You are nothing but an embarrassment!  To bad that we in Hawaii cannot get anyone with any common sense for representation.
@maziehirono @ChemiShalev Another Mensa candidate.
@maziehirono @PeterBeinart You have a pretty smile, but do you have your wits, to see the future!?  The deal is a prelude to 
WAR!  Hope not
@maziehirono @RobertMackey excellent!
@maziehirono bravo!
@maziehirono we all support the Iran deal by a landslide dont listen to the Israeli supporters they just want us to fight and die for Israel
@maziehirono Thank you
