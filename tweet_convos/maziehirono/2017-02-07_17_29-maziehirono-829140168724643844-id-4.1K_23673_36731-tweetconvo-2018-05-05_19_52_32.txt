We love you Elizabeth! THANK YOU!!
@rezaaslan @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Thank you for standing true, Senator. Mass stands with you.
Shame on @SenateMajLdr for cutting off @SenWarren. Sadly I’m not surprised since he and Sen. Sessions work to silence voters. #StopSessions
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVyq6kAN6u4 …
This was wrong on so many levels!
@MaddowBlog @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr OUTRAGEOUS! SLIMEY GOP SENATORS! WE STILL HAVE LAWS FREE SPEECH  IMPEACH TRUMP/BANNON!
that was an amazing move Mrs Warren
McConnell should be ashamed, embarrassed. His behavior is at the very least unethical.
Mitch McConnell is an ASSHOLE!  AND he is also a TRAITOR!!  #MerrickGarland  #SCOTUS
You are so right Jim.
McConnell still wears his KKK robe on weekends! Totally unAmerican to silence Sen Warren
show everyone what a fascist you are McConnell..u &trump are a pair
you were warned by the Pres of Senate and decided to ignore it in vio of Senate Rule 19
unconscionable.
Thank you Sen Warren.  Shame on you Mcconnell
You are wearing the armor of truth. The next Dem should finish the letter   You rock!
You committed slander my dear. Take a seat and zip thy lip
Wow.  McConell so is such an embarrassment to Kentucky!  :(
You put this asshole in office. Now, take him out.
Thank God the Majority Leader had the good sense to do so.
LOL
What an awful woman. Dare I say NASTY!  Senator Shilling. I can't wait.
So you red card @SenWarren for reading CSK's letter? That's ok we'll share it https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259988-Scott-King-1986-Letter-and-Testimony-Signed.html#document/p1 …
I would have started cursing and throwing punches. I love you Sen Warren! 
calm down!
this is what fascists do!! They censor speech!! Keep fighting!!!
This is insane and, ironically, suggests that the motives of @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr should be impugned.
GOOD. YOU KEEP WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME WITH NONSENSE AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING IT TOO.
you keep up the fight - MA is behind you all the way.
Obstructionist! @SenWarren Please post the rst of your speech we will make sure you are heard!  @SenatorSessions  @YouTube
A sad day in our country. And this during Black History Month.
KEEP SPEAKING OUT SENATOR WARREN

Idiot!!
Good, listening to you makes the skin of my ears peel off.
thank goodness he did
SHAMEFUL. You keep speaking up. #WOKE
I hope you being silenced is permanent
It's the people of Massachsetts that should sanction #PocahontasWarren ...by recalling her. 
#MAGA
Mr. McConnell, you are a shame to this nation. You have been bought and paid for ten times over
What will it take to bring this evil man down!!!
hope that our nation's people are better than this. Boycotts of corps and people who support this. And all of us speaking up.
I hope so too but I must confess I am worried
I am too, but we must stay together and work as a whole. This is going to be a long fight
It's going to be a long 8 yrs.
Trump won't be in for 8 years or even  4. #ImpeachTrump by 2018 ,get rid of Pence, Bannon,Ryan Mitch etc.
We had a lot of things 2 Impeach @BarackObama for and it never happened.Sorry!
Nevertheless, you persisted and became a hero. Thank you.
.@SenWarren Hopefully voters will silence you in 2018 when you run for reelection.
We the people hope that!!
STFU Pocahontas!
He had to, because you never shut your yap. You just keep endlessly screeching idiocy that makes no sense & wasting everyone's valuable time
Yeah he did, and it was AWSOME!  #BURN
It was an admirable war whoop
Warren should never speak. she's a dumb ass like Sara
GO GET THOSE RACIST POWER MONGERS!!!
You are a crook.
Hey fakahontis, you silenced yourself with your rhetoric Exactly how does one like you speak so much and never say anyrhing of substance.
Please share your remarks and we can all re-share them on @SenateMajLdr's timeline. You will be heard.
If by personal soapbox you mean daring to speak the words of the widow of Dr. King.
I would call this a personal obstructionist soapbox:
Maybe you didn't hear the clip. Or maybe you forgot Merrick Garland.
Election is over, but resistance is not. Fight back! Resist!
Reality Winner used you in her twitter account Elizabeth Warren.
Really? Silence a strong feminist like you, Pocahontas?  Boy! That was easy!
Thanks Mitch
Tired of these Dems wasting our tax dollars
Hopefully, the voters of Massachusetts will silence you forever!
because you couldn't keep to the issues, had to pull out some ancient letter
Because showing history of racism & voter suppression isn't an issue to consider... Sure
wasn't an issue in 2006 when all those dems were voting for him.
Wtf are you talking about? The letter is from the 80's. Always been an issue.
#liar #hypocrisy
Deal with it
Already did, Pocahontas is done lmao #ShutHerUp
That was the very best moment of the entire Session. Pun intended
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan and @RNC Chairs All Betrayed The United States During the Republican National Convention, Dealing DIRECTLY. with Putins Spys They CLOSED THE DEAL FOR THE TRUMP HACK. HACK!.  ILLEGALLY SEATED OVAL OFFICE RESIDENT OF THE U.S. !!
So, the young lady who was just arrested for leaking top secret docs, she sure likes to retweet your junk.
Nevertheless, Senator, keep persisting!! So will we
thank you @SenWarren 4 being a true heroine!!!
Not surprisingBUT VERY INFURIATINGI copied
this from a nasty trumptroll.
No way it was a woman's
acct-they just 2 pretend
but this one is SO MUCH better
That is because you don't know when to shut up.
She was silenced for reading Corretta Scott King.
She died in 2006. Are you insane?
How am I insane? She was reading this letter and was silenced for impugning a Senator.
That is just BS grandstanding and doesn't belong on the Senate floor. All citizens have the right to vote. Follow directions.
.@GBLynden Did you say the same when Cruz read Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters from the floor of the Senate?
Yes, fuck grandstanding and do work.
.@GBLynden Well at least you're consistent but speaking from the floor is part of their job.
 @godlessVG @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr You were silenced because you cannot keep your hole shut!
we have your back! #letlizspeak sent Kings letter to McConnell today!
THANK YOU @SenWarren for standing agnst @POTUS' terrible AG pick! Wish my KY sen. @SenateMajLdr wasn't on the wrong side today. Keep it up!
thank you for your courage in the face of repression! SenateMajLdr should be ashamed!
@votolatino @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Women of America we don't need to be mansplained too
This is not normal times We have been in crisis for a while and continue to be
Mitch McConnell is Pathetic. All he did was elevate your platform #imwithyou
funny thing about rules. You break them you suffer the consequences. You commies are powerless to stop anything the GOP does. 
THANK GOODNESS SOMEONE DID!!
please stop talking and vote!
Thank you for speaking out vs @SenatorSessions whose record is troubling @SenateMajLdr cares more for GOP than US principles
If so many Americans are outraged by Sen. McConnell's refusal to allow you to impugn another senator, where's the outcry?
hmm didn't  he silence release of RussianInvestigation during Elec?And wife has a cabinet post now?
Keep fighting, @SenWarren. We are with you. #StopSessions
this government is going in a direction that the world has witnessed before. #FascismUSA
#SADSTATEOFAFFAIRS. I would not have left. Carry me out!!!!
Elizabeth you are just trying to get money You are shallow
Very sad thing that is happening...What we have on board are followers, not leaders
bout time some one shut your so called lying Native American mouth up, you're a liar

God bless Sen McConnell
I am proud of you Senator Warren. Keep persisting!
'45' AND ALL of his GANG are NOT QUALIFIED. McConnell MUST GO!
Why not talk about the 1.3million line of credit?
Give them hell!
Thank you. We'll fight to relieve the power hungry of their power in 2018. #resist
Instead of working with Republicans to fix our country you rather throw tantrums.
The Republicans stifling free speech & being dictatorial again -- stand up to them, Elizabeth! 
thank you for finally silencing this hate spewing woman! She is an embarrassment! I thank u!
Senator Warren, thank you.  McConnell can silence you in the Senate, but he cannot silence us.
Hang tough @SenWarren this is BS!!!
you have no merit to argue racism as much as I can say racism Democrats
shame on this senate for silencing so@eone who speaks with reason. @SenateMajLdr is a disgrace
Great Work!
@Nord_Eh @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube I love you, Liz. These two just showed their asses, can't I see that.
Thank you for your support and your active approach. A true role model. 
@AndyRichter @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr Senator Warren, I am thankful that you persist.
McConnell is one of the biggest hypocrites in our government. No ethics whatsoever.
as well he should have
You liar! You got to speak for a whole hour!
He and his cronies just love that 2nd amendment, the 1st not so much. #wewillnotbequiet!
#CorettaScottKing #MartinLutherKing #blackhistoryisamericanhistory #BlackHistoryMonth

@TheBradBlog @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube #letlizspeak
Please keep fighting for us. xxoo
: A woman silenced reading the words of a black civil rights activist against the nomination of a racist. The symbolism is thick.
Teddy Kennedy Kills women by drowning them to cover his DWI.
We are with you, shoulder to shoulder. We. Shall. Not. Be. Moved. @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube
old racists have to look out for one another!
how can he even look at himself in the mirror? What a pathetic joke of a human being MM
Why does that rule even apply to nominees? Shouldn't.
Senator Warren is a Shero! Thank you! #ShePersisted
If this goes on, we ordinary citizens will soon find our right to free speech taken away.
To me this is the biggest disgrace ever. McConnell should step down.
silly #Pocahontas, you broke the rules #civility
The more power these gop nazis have, the more we lose for generations
somebody needed to do it...@SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube
@gracefulemilia @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube we love you senator. Thank you for speaking truth!!!
No problem w/someone so appalling 4 many yrs in Senate w/U?U timed UR upset nowMiss Pocahontas
If you want to speak you should try following the Senate rules. smh
Senator McConnell and the presiding officer should apologize.  Without dissent, no democracy
This just builds the momentum of the Resistance. Thank you Senator Warren.
Thank you! I was watching as everything unfolded and was in awe of what I was witnessing. #WeAreWithYou
The senate is a deliberative body. #letlizspeak

Totally agree,but it's a bit hard not 2 b angry w/@SenWarren for too little too late.She seriously coulda made the difference
@swbrohoney @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube His face makes me want to be sick 
That turkey necked fraud can't silence us all Senator. Please remain vigilant as will we all.
Glad to see it. Your tongue is loose at both ends.
Senator Warren...Be strong, be brave, but please, do not be silent. You are my voice.
, great job Mr. McConnell, EW the venous words of anarchists.

I know you did this on purpose. And I hope others will realize you're worthless
@MrGeorgeWallace @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Keep speaking. We are with you.
@ggpepperdash @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr Eek. Warren, we hear you, we stand with you, now the WORLD has read the letter!
McConnell's act worthy of Cirque de Soleil: putting own head up his own KY  derrière.
