Oh, you mean defunding Planned Parenthood? Since when is killing the fetus considered "maternity care"?
Used to b they stopped caring after birth. Now its at 20 weeks
@clairecmc Quit Lying pigs
Take away their Viagra, prostate exams and treatment, oh and, no more sex for these bastards.
Men don't get maternity leave, why should women?  Oh... so we're really NOT equal, are we?  Strange that God made us different, isn't it?
And you are plotting to take away our safety and protection by your blind political and rabid insistence on illegal immigrants.
#dropthosebabies in the field and keep working girls! #daddysgotyourback a room full of white men spells no good. #timeforawoman
.@EnergyCommerce Can't wait to have organize a room full of women to eliminate prostate cancer screening,Viagra & Rogaine scripts! Jerks!
Maybe a room full of women should threaten to take away their prostate cancer screenings?
or their Viagra.
@embolina95  the purge society!
@clairecmc Nice scare tactic, but nobody believes you.
@clairecmc So gender determines ability?  Isn't pregnancy a personal choice? And, it wasn't taking away care. #halftruths
@clairecmc Once again a room full of whit men making decisions about women's healthcare. STOP IT!
ENHANCE
(if it matters she doesn't look happy and is one of the few not applauding)
I think she's tweeting
Sure this isn't a Klan meeting... #askingforafriend
.@RealSmartAss47 @EnergyCommerce LMAO!Need start ending all @GOP @realDonaldTrump "meetings"&especially right in middle #ahca all votes,with
And historical context...
.@RealSmartAss47 @EnergyCommerce @GOP @realDonaldTrump Literally have that episode on my DVR .
YEP.
America-what have you done!
What a bunch of creeps. A group of men deciding to take your rights to good health away. Need their asses soundly kicked.
No maternity care, contraception, or female cancer screenings. #HealthTips #TrumpCare 
I think you went to the Blumenthal/Murhphy school of lying.
Then we should take away their prostate exams, testicular cancer treatments, testosterone therapy, and boner pills.
@clairecmc. So let's go for no pmnt for Viagra. Woman also have the power by withholding sex.No maternity coverage needed.
Isn't is great that trump's cult reflects the diversity of this great nation so perfectly. Last stand of misogynistic old white men.
Not true
@clairecmc that's a lie. There are two women there
further evidence of the Kremlin's useful idiots planning to enslave America beneath Russian hob nailed boots
Women need to fight back!!
so not only do they want to force women to carry unwanted pregnancies but then die giving birth? That's pro-life? #Ghouls
Old, doughy, ignorant white guys who *think* a woman's only worth is as a sperm receptacle or broodmare.
A room full of white men. #NoTrumpCare
@clairecmc the sky is falling the sky is falling....claire 'chicken little' mcCaskill
Cause they have a stake in it, huh?
Not a woman in sight and surprise, surprise...no people of colour! smh
Women should stop complaining! Majority of women voted for the p*ssy grabber! Live with the stupid choice US women made!
@SierraClub I see one traitor, ahem I mean female (If we can call her that).
A room full of OLD men. #shameful
@BewareTheBeliev I'm sure most of them have viagra in their pockets.
a bunch of idiots applauding themselves
This is shameful!
Where are all the GOP congressional women at for this conversation on women's health coverage?
The playground bullies who never matured into manhood. Appalling.
@SenateDems looking at all these old white men I'm wondering if there's actually clause making sure their Viagra is covered
@GOP #Republican men. #Sadists
This mad me want to throw up.Worst part is the complete lack of understanding on the economics of insurance
are they born of incubators ?
@SenateDems and their little blue pills should b taken from them,no prostatectomies if problems come up,deal with it#GOP
@clairecmc Omg such lies!!!
They are trying to take away everything in the healthcare that people can afford. You all whom voted for him better read it.
This is insane.
They will go off to celebrate with trafficked underage "hookers" afterwards. On their government viagra and penis pumps.
that's not true, women can still choose to purchase that as part of their insurance. U should stop lying
lookout you cretens, we're coming for you in 2018
Viagra Society.
Something similar about all these folks. Can't quite put my finger on it...
@maziehirono Please give them a uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes.
Never have seen so many bald men in one room.
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @mashable
@RepGwenMoore 
Those jackasses ought to be....
@AlanAdventurer men with NO #BALLS
@pussyhat4peace complete disrespect to woman.
Amen to that no respect.
where are all the pro-lifers now? You know, the good, "Christian" Trump voters that care so much about the unborn 
@POTUS @realdonaltrump Typical for a group of Republicans #ResistTrumpCare
wait way in the upper left corner by the curtains I see @KellyannePolls...ok you're right
@clairecmc I support TrumpCare!Look how wrong you was on obamaCare!
#Republicare
Old white men with cabbage disease, you know, the stalk won't hold the head up!
American Taliban. Nice to see men applauding themselves as they legislating ladies parts.
@clairecmc Shame on them and SHAME on their so-called "conservative christian and family" values.
And they have the audacity of calling themselves pro-life.
asswipes!
@kharyp only one woman Kellyanne Conway...pic should go to women's rights groups..for that matter ALL civil rights groups
THEIR MOTHER'S WOULD BE SO PROUD!!
"All hail to the Great Leader". Sickening. Yes. You women keep propagating but don't count on us for anything.
Not fair.
@clairecmc   I don't think men need maternity leave.
Sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Will make it more expensive for women that may want it. Dunces don't understand how insurance works.
@SierraClub That's the new definition of "pro-life" (in quotes). #ResistTrumpCare
@clairecmc the republicans would prefer the Logan's Run healthcare plan if they could
@clairecmc I spy with my little eye one who lies behind the men with ties @KellyannePolls
@ShesWithUs2016 Take away their Viagra. Good luck with that men.
@SenateDems maybe if we cut men wankers then we wouldn't have to deal with maternity care
@SenateDems But democrats don't like babies! You kill them
| Father Knows Best Syndrome: Politicians don't believe they are God, but they certainly act like Gods appointed.
A room full of white @gop men is crafting social policy.
they couldn't come up with a single woman to stick in there? big lady eyeroll from us.
Not one woman in the room, except KAC, but she doesn't care about women. This all makes me so sick!!
Old, white, rich guys. Good ol' boys!
@SenateDems stop them
@CNN @Rosie @cher @NYT
It's official; the Fascism we fought in WWII has now engulfed the @WhiteHouse & @GOP.
@maziehirono  I hope you're in that room also otherwise you are #fakenews
#ProtectOurCare #VoteNoAHCA
looks like Trump took "White House" too seriously. Appears he decided to #whitewash when appointing his cronies.
villainous
Useless bunch of Fools.Need to clean house.
Witness: "I'm hearing the cheer "Let Them Die" or "We Don't Care" coming from that room." This is REAL 4 people - NOT Party!
@SenateDems will they still allow maternity care for male babies?
@SenateDems Is Kellyanne their token vagina for the press photo?
yep
So overwhelming.  What has become of this country to elect such evil men to power?
@SenateDems A bunch of dicks doing everything to damage women. When are women going to wake up and stop being 2nd class.
@SenateDems they are all going to hell
No. You have choices. If you are a person with no need you do not have to buy.
@FightingMad1 Guessing all their mothers have passed away; how to look them in the eye now? #TrumpCare
@maziehirono why do old white guys always think they know more about a womens health then the women? R they all doctors?
And it's confirmed. They don't know where babies come from...
...and access to contraception that would prevent said maternity.
Being sinister, 25 Dems need to vote FOR the bill to make sure it passes. Think of it as assisted suicide for GOP ;)
@johnnychard There's a special place in hell for these sanctimonious bustards. We won't forget. #stayangry #midterms2018
the KKK goes casual
The bastards are going to lose, it's all of us against the 2017 #Hitler #Regime and it will #FAIL #TREMENDOUSLY #IMPEACHMENT
How do people even think about taking away maternity care?
they are shameless men .
They Should Never Have a Say let Alone CONTROL over a WOMAN'S Body! @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLeader #deplorable
PPL applauding DJT makes me sick. Not just Russia,his kids,his$ conflicts.He thought it funny 2 grab a girls crotch #%^&
@markos A room full of men ... and @KellyannePolls, who should be deeply, irrevocably ashamed of herself.
@emilyslist I hate you.  Not too strong words.  I HATE YOU.
Fret not, these men have taken counsel of one another i.e. fools, what they have purposed shall not stand.
The photo says it all.
@AFTHealthcare don't understand how a significant amount of women voted for DJT and a GOP congress
it was easy. #ProLife
And having a good ol' time doing it. Heartless group.
Viagra should have a monthly purchase cap and have a note from your partner on why you need it!
this is a great ideal !!
Disguising!  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  I think that we should start making decisions about men!
why the hell is bartering going on with american people's healthcare? this is disgusting.
@Kat4Obama GrossOldPoliticians. Gotta go. Clean House & Senate. #resist #Vote2018
its revenge for the womenâ€™s march
A room full of men and one Crypt Keeper in blue up there as well.
Isn't that rich!!
Like these morons don't do enough by getting women pregnant. Now take away healthcare. Let voters remember this.
NOOOOO TO men with the final say!!!! Millions of Americans are WOMEN!!! @womensmarch
2 bad they didn't support Clinton. Btw-A hijab wearing woman is not the face of equality=@womensmarch.Clinton is
@janschakowsky Why am I not surprised?
Yes, that wasn't staged 4 this photo. A bunch of patsy puppets these GOP R. I hope 'Murica remembers their actions.
that's a lot of old white guys...
Rich and uterus free.
AWESOME!!! MORE TAXES!!!!! I can't wait to have less!!!!!!! #newjerseytaxes #deadmiddleclass
@DorisMatsui It's called MATERNITY, not Paternity. Let women make these decisions regarding our Maternity Care.
