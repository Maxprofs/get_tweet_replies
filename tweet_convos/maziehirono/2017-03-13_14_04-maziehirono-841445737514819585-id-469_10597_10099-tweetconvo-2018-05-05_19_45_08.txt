Oh man. That is appalling. Frankly, the amount under Obamacare was already really steep. So pleased we have universal healthcare in the U.K.
Yeah. The NHS is just peachy.
Enjoy your life.
Wow...what a snowflake. Sarcastically said the NHS is just peachy, and Hatch blocks me. Some discourse
@Moomer_
If our population was as small as Japan's and similar to Japan's everything would be easier.
we are the richest nation in the world, all the money is going to richest Americans!! Nothing trickles down!
@firesign1969 Trump supporters are talking loud now...just wait.
Nope!  I changed my entire web business twitter account into a political one. That is not enough tho.
Me too. I voted libertarian last election because I knew about Hillary and Trump was not an option. Need fresh blue.
so youre the reason we have #trump for prez. Thank you
Um...yeah ok 
@IndivisibleHTX ssi $720mo= $8640yr +foodstamps-$95 NOT incl otcRx+nonGroceryEssentials

Thank God I live in a country w universal health care, really affordable and free services if needed.
Virtually everything CNN says is bullshit. There are people paying 14,600 today who are in their 50s with no income.
you know nothing!! Right now my family pays over 14,000 a year with 4000 deductible and we make less than 100k it's destroying us
Ours is same .. but making it work. Everyone deserves healthcare. Used to opp Univ HC until I did resrch..
..why can't problems be fixed?? Healthcare/Ins/Pharma. Corruptn and greed!
the problem can't be fixed because govt is more corrupt than any company. Big pharma saves lives and makes a profit
.@mj_lee @maryannemarsh 2026 huh? At least we're not being forced to pay 4 either one of your prostate exams any more:) #RepealDontReplace
Do you get that Ryan's bill also proposes 'paying for other people's healthcare'? That's how govt works.
I'm all for #RepealDontReplace they can expand Medicaid or pay for their own shit #MyGiveADamnsBroken
Literally all of government is society paying for collective goods. Actually, that's really what society is
Do not talk to Republicans about caring about other humans, they just pretend to give a shit
citation to your "facts"?
@dlemen where are you getting your facts?  Would like to see myself
Important question to ask. Check Table 4 of the CBO report on AHCA, top half of table. https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf … @mj_lee
thank you
Np brother
@KevinMencer It's one way to kill off seniors--can't afford care so just die early. Guess that saves Repubs money.
sadly, in their minds, it does!
so apparently Americans no longer care abt taking care of the less fortunate or the elderly or the physically/mentally challenged
<source>
@MikeSimms99 THAT RIGHT HE IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN in 1900 criteria. By the standards of Jesus and 2017 not so much
@JohnnyDeMayo that is insane ....
@sevenbowie but if we help the poor they will stay poor by choice-Paul Ryan
Can we agree this guy is full of shit.
@robbieann4 700+% increase, The reason this bill is only 67 pages is because most of it is in fine print. Hard to read
So how t they going 2 live on about1200. A yeat tell me b/c I'm 62 & i make much less than 26,500 a yr
.@Valerie21614400 @mj_lee working? Skills? Education? Any of that?
Not the point. No mandate, so they won't buy it. Now they will go to ER and get care without paying.
https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/841396828239200256 … go nuts
Obamacare: 64 year old making $26.5K would pay $1,700 in 2026.

GOP plan: The same person would pay $14,600. 
@johannagriese this is robbery without the guns how can these lawmen sleep at night
they don't care sadly I think that's the truth it's all about money not people for them
no greed we should vote on trem limit for senators , congressmen/women and representatives
@warrenleightTV I'm young, have decent income, would pay less with this by a calculator. This is not making sense.
Me too. My family would now get a tax cut and we don't need it. We can afford our healthcare. Help others.
Would current Obamacare still be viable in 2026? I see insurers pulling out.
did you see *why* insurers were pulling out? 1 is to "maximize pain" http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-aetna-obamacare-20170123-story.html …
except they won't pay that because they need a home and food.
.@rcerler @mj_lee your job doesn't pay the bills? #SkillUp and get a better one
what about those who can't afford to "skill up"?
.@king_kyyle @rcerler on the job training never cost me a dime.  employer is also on probation never quit a job till you have a better one
this argument doesnt make sense. There will always be low wage jobs for unskilled workers.
So 1/2 my income will go 2 housing & >1/2 to #GOP #Trumpcare. So I won't have 2 thnk of wht 2 mk 4 dinner: There won't be any.
Yes and in GOP eyes that person cannot invest in stocks so needs to pay BIG INSURANCE
Utter nonsense! #FakeNews The plans that might be offered once the market is reconstituted can't yet be quoted.  @kevincorke
@Melody_Chicago it's a freaking mess.Less coverage 4 more money.It'll take years 4 premiums 2 go down if so.
The cheaper premiums don't help if the plans have a lot of exclusions, high co-pays and huge deductibles.
There is no way that GOP bill will pass but we said the same 4 Trump.It'll be a disaster if it did pass.
Wow! That's cutting those costs! Cut Trump's damn FL vacations! Can feed thousands of familes for one month w/that $$!
Thank u!
You're very welcome!
@Jill_Hamilton is this true? Surely it's physically impossible to give up over half your income to healthcare?

Obamacare: 64 year old making $26.5K would pay $1,700 in 2026.

GOP plan: The same person would pay $14,600. 
and they would pay this per year? Fucking hell!
@hilaryr that's not true. Under GOP plan that person pays nothing. Because they will be dead.
hopefully the leftists will go first
so typical.
It would be much cheaper to bury me
That's what they are counting on.
@mj_leei I really hope it doesn't come to that. My family has a family plot but I don't want to go home anytime soon. I just visit.
@obsessivelyMe Well if they signed up for it, and Trump said FOR ALMOST A YEAR that he would repeal the ACA, should we feel sorry?
I do believe you have mistakenly interpreted the tweet.
Educate me then.
I understand t he twt you responded to as a comparison of increase in cost..dramatic decrease in affordability
I would think anyone who voted for him would understand this is what they signed up for/
Yes, @mj_lee but he would have the freedom to be uninsured, and that's the American way.
Paul Ryan "Freedom & Choice" no affordable healthcare 2017 USA. No wonder GOP not talking about "American Exceptionalism"
wait...someone actually read this one? I thought it would be rubber stamped like Obamacare
no worries, Democrats will be back in 4 years and scrap this plan and re-do Obamacare
I followed you, I'll debate you.  Lol.  But please give me better arguments or I WILL DESTROY U!  Lol. :) N e time, n e place!
I mean, what's your real agenda here?  I'm here to help Americans.  Your talking about THE YEAR 2026 before 2/3 of the bill is out!
many of these might be trump voters?  @zuschoen
under obama care a 64 year old couple would pay 34,000 with a 6,500 deductible . I know my parents are paying that
GOP calculators hazy about decimal places (as well as everything else)  - thought under new plan cost would be $1460
Where'd you pull that conclusion from?
@Tplusthree 
2026? How long do you expect a Trump supporter to live given that black lung disease is not covered anymore?Sarcasm off
@abrar_ul_jatt this is bad
not really?
smh 
@joanjuneau Trump and Friends will call it Fake News and his voters still buy it
They will believe him until they are hit w the financial reality of higher premiums, higher deductibles, & higher co-pays
Well should get ready
very important! We should stick to the ACA
@stacy_stetten 
The Federal Government should not be in the insurance business.It should be a competitive market across state lines. This will work.
@john_coster 

And under Obamacare that same persons bill is still 14,600 however someone else ( taxpayers) have to pay it
are these estimates from CBO?
just don't buy that iPhone
@GovHowardDeanI just pressed 'Heart'  that doesn't mean I love the harm the GOP plan will do. Nonetheless I'm pissed @pthe GOPHERS
need a simple calc app - takes your age and income and gives you this comparison - and then send impact to our elected



I don't believe that, c'mon
@gerhadt_kreuz Sweet! 
Fo'sure!
call it Trumpcare. only reason GOP has chance to undue ACA was calling it Obamacare. We need to link this shit with Trump to stop it
760% increase for those in the most likely to vote demo... smooth!
plus tax!
@PKFLRDA some of these suckers gonna tell you they didn't know after voting their FOP pols in again.
@PKFLRDA I'm 58. This does not make me happy.
@llunarossa I'm on Medicare and pay $1440/yr
so they basically get 12k in tax dollars you stole from us so you could buy votes
HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE!! Healthcare cost more for those who will need it the most? REALLY!! Wake up folks. This is BETTER ?!?
Hope Americans waking up, #Trumpcare
@LisaClaire9090 but beaverboy says they can just not buy an iPhone....
@Congress @Senate @CNN @ABC @CBS @MSNBC Keep Fighting Ending ObamaCare Or We're Really All Screwed Unless Your Rich
misleading the public. You're not comparing  to .
Yeah but they'll have more choices so that's something. Like "pine or oak"? You know, for their coffin
@Llamamama85 why people always vote against their best interest 11/16 they had achancy to vote Ryan out theydidnot a lesson learned
@ihearthk4   That's just the premium lol what for it to actually do something under Obamacare
Thanks and unlike Obama, the GOP will take this into account and fix it, assuming it`s true..
They wouldn't be paying...they'd be DEAD...#SUCKonTHATGOP!
@GovHowardDean And, the same 64yr old making 1,000,000 would get a tax break of $12,900 under #TrumpCare
almost half their yearly salary
Yeah, $1700 with a $25k deductible, maybe YOU want a plan like that?
@ScottNevins Why not just go on Medicare, best deal I ever had
No they won't. They will do without insurance. And many of them will die.
SAD!
with what deductible - 10k deduction is a killer
for 1700 I can get aca that has a higher deductible-
if you know the gop nazis it will be much more than that
@MeredithJGavin 
So incorrect....So incorrect
would you please correct it then? Cc: @jessiecwax
@LHSummers Can't wait for you to analyze the other 349,999,999 Americans, I'll hold off till you deliver those numbers.
with fewer people getting healthcare, they will die younger.  Fewer payouts from social security, sounds like a win /s
links please,
this is not the same for ALL 64 yr olds in ALL counties. Some win, some do not.
it's a shame in ANY county.
my point was that in some counties, the costs decrease
@KathyStricker2 I guess the reps are hoping we will all just die by then!!
Sounds fair. Right?  Right? 
@mheany2
Specific examples like this elucidate actual outcomes for our friends. This now can be someone's mom and wife.
At 60, I paid insurance for 35 yrs when I didn't need it. Now I'm in the "need it" yrs, they're wanting to screw with it? I PAID IN.
Rent w/utilities, cheapest apx= $12K p/yr, & H C = $26K. No food stamps/ bc of income.
You're $100 in the hole & starve 2 death.
GOP's goal = #AmericanGenocide
@VLVANCE  that is INCORRECT under the GOP TRUMP CARE those figures  u Quote  are correct.  NOT ACA Obama  Care. Get it stright 1st
I'm a Trump guy but FTS
The voters picked the GOP-Republicans & price/prize we'd pay for that honor! Fraudulent Republicans were clear of their intentions!
@ClaudiaDAquin No one chooses not to have health care. Only reason you wouldn't have it is it's too expensive, like it soon will be.
Not. You have your facts wrong dear.
@andylassner and yet they can apply for Medicare in two years. Go figure.
where are your sources?
You mean Trumpcare...
Ms. Lee @Woodyman502 @mj_lee                                  check your feed.  You inadvertently used "ObamaCare" instead of "TrumpCare"
Thank you for the Truth, which cannot expect from the Trump administration and GOP. Clearly see the better plan for most Americans
no, under GOP plan a 64 yr making $25,000 old would die, before being eligible for Medicare, which is the GOP plan
well, it is just hard to believe there are politicians who genuinely think that is okay
yeah but that same person should just stop buying 17 iPhones per year, and then the plan pays for itself.
Sounds like those death panels they warned us about
Freedom of choice?
facts!! . http://www.weeklystandard.com/cbo-misses-its-obamacare-projection-by-24-million-people/article/2001732 …
fuzzy math
I'm trying to get tag ◄ #GOPcare ► to get use over #trumpcare..so when it sinks (which it will) will take R Party down like an  #Ω
the entire GOP mindset is given away when you see that a 64yo making 26.5k pays the same as one making more than 60k
@forewit FAKE NEWS is all around us, especially at CNN.
point is, the 64 yo won't pay the $14k. They will be uninsured, wait to go to ER when really sick, and then incur 100ks of bills.
but Mark Zuckerburg will get a subsidy to help him buy health insurance. So there is some good news.
Ryan says such a person would choose not to have insurance. Ridiculous
Just like those same people are choosing not to be millionaires.
oh and BTW have to wait 14 months before they get this tax credit back Just to pay it over the next 3 months. Go go me Generation
a family of 5 (3 kids) making $60k a year pay $12k now. New plan they have to shell out $q8-20k for catastrophic only coverage.
yep
@POTUS This is what I'm worried about!!! Love our @POTUS but please leave the subsidies alone!!!
But, access, choice, and tax cuts for the rich...
so important? sure you reported the whole you can keep your doctor and you premium will will go down $2,500 with the same vigor
@jleohach and at 65 go one Medicare and pay $115.00 a month
But Obamacare would implode long before that and leave them with nothing.
@andylassner yes, plan is an improvement but not good enough.
Important:
Under ACA 47-yr-old wife paid $4000 in 2015 ($253/mth $1k ded)
Same 49-yr-old paying $17,000+ in 2017 ($1016/mth $5k ded)
@BigKittyOz ...big numbers
@BigKittyOz please don't speak unless your actually informed you just sound ignorant to anyone that is dumb enough to be afraid of..
@BigKittyOz FALSE
@forewit The amount paid is irrelevant. Present day family deductibles are $12,000. Single person deductibles are $7000.
easy. Don't buy an iphone. Problem solved.
But many of them voted for it. so what can we do?
The busses that provided transportation for illegal voters could be used to give US refugees rides to Canada and Mexico. #DonTheCon
but Rump won bcz OC premiums were going up??
@keithboykin proof
@WendyVerran Another reason I left the USA. Combined HC insurance for me/spouse  $1,800 year. MD visits $12.50. It can be done.
These are Trump voters, fuck'em.
Unfortunately, Trump voters had the ACA. Obamacare gave "those people" "handouts"  and it had to stop. This is what they voted for.
@e_maescott But skyrocketing costs under the ACA, blah, blah, blah amirite? #GOPConjob
all lies all lies they own this so give them an anchor and short gangplank
Ooh they might have to give up their iphone....and eating.
@realDonaldTrump you don't really think you'd get away with signing that, do you?
#Trumpcare
yeah but all the 'access' he'll enjoy & the choice of doctors that he won't be able to afford
What's wrong with that? The Donald's making America great again. Not so? The march to 'unaffordable' healthcare is just starting.
@gumbo_goddess Also really important: those figures do not include the deductible.
Sigh...
don't believe math, don't believe your eyes or intelligence .look over there, the sleight of hand.it's Donnie the Magician!!
 TrumpCare = We Dont Care 

.
@AndyRichter - Even $1,700 is too much for retirees in the present economic climate, let's get real here.
@JKH2 I'm that person, except I'm 61. I will be without healthcare and homeless.
@lnmuir @mj_lee holly crap . I live in Canada why can't The USA have healthcare like we do. How hard is it?
If you want Medicaid for all then what happens when THEY will say there's no more  $$$??? #Anarchy
fake news
.@mj_lee @MichaelEHuck That's $142 a month under Obamacare vs. $1,217 a month under Trumpcare.

You pay $1,075 more per month with Trumpcare
B.S.
Really important: since when has CNN been a reliable unbiased source of information? Let's see your sources backing your claim.
@1followernodad Choose between insurance, groceries,or utilities. The future is bleak .#Trumpcare
@dluxmaroon 
And that 64 year old probably voted for 45.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP  
#WeThePeople 
#SCAM & REJECT#Trumpcare
You
Are
FIRED
#TrumpRussia
#TheResistance
Nope. You got that wrong. Try again.
@andylassner I guess you don't understand the fact that Obamacare won't be around in 26'.
oh, this person is a CNN reporter.  Spreading lies a bias. Don't believe this shit.
