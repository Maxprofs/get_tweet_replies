3 things to watch after the GOP pulls the Obamacare repeal bill http://politi.co/2nlufEk 
@PrincessBravato technically he never said 64 days. 
@birdieglad @wonderfulcafe 
Where is "64 days" in ANY of these clips?
you are still believing all the lies of your líder?
You are good at making up shit.  Where in the videos is "64 days"?
bye bye , enjoy Don the Con presidency
Does Trump think he's the only one who can Google?
@lovealaska1105
Liar In Chief 

and yet, he doesn't pay any price. Makes me think the fix is in. 
#trumpRussia
Talking out of his ass. Bull shit artist had no plan.
did you make an obama clip of him repeating the most important lie over and over that actually affected millions
@PrincessBravato   Lied
@politico Remember all those cameras that U enjoyed putting ur strategies out to encourage the votes - backfiring..eh?
politifact filed it under LIE OF THE YEAR
True.  Didn't he say it would be on day 1???
They keep calling it 'Obama'care. Nice tag. Now I see why people were confused.Not the news but the candidate saying it.
@bannerite Ass + hole = Trump
Obama played Fake Golf, probably could not break 85 without a few "Mulligans"

@maziehirono 
3/4 VOTER'S' FOR OUR PRESIDENT!

@ButchyMcLarty Would that be similar to his claims to having a plan to defeat ISIS in the 1st 30 days of his presidency.
I think that time is up too.
@NickTimiraos he said it like 64 times a day on the campaign trail for god's sake! 45, living brain cells?
@WhiteHouse U can't deny...it's on numerous videos of ur rallies!
@politico a lie
Have you not learnt the golly in quoting earlier Trump against now Trump?
The Liar in Chief
No, he said he would do it so fast! On the First Day! 
#ClownTrump #PutinsPuppet
@ChrisBlundell remember Martin Short's character from SNL "I didn't say that"???
@JJohnsonLaw He never said nothin’ ‘bout no 64 days.
He said FIRST DAY he'd repeal ACA.
oh God stroke out and spend the rest of ur days learning to walk
@JJohnsonLaw Inveterate liar
@politico no, he said he'd do on day one of his term. So, @realDonaldTrump 64 days late and counting.
@politico 
You said day one!
Donald....DONALD!!! You dropped this! @michaelschwab13
@Repbeth1 each day @realDonaldTrump continues to like. Shows how delusional he is and can't be trusted. 64 days and nothing
@politico we all know he's a liar #donthecon #liarinchief
@ClementsIra Such.a.liar.
@matthaig1 "itvwill be essentially simultaneously" WTF?
@politico his statement is about 64 days he is a D bag
@matthaig1 He is getting schooled.
we will do it & we will do it VERY quickly! Same day, same week...Shoot could be the same hour scratching my head
I knew I wasn't crazy!! @realDonaldTrump
I can't recall a bigger liar than this idiot. He insults us all when he denies saying things we clearly heard him say..smh
The man is an absolute total knob head
@ScottDPierce as we all watch premiums and deductibles rise under Obamacare; not cool
omg just replace obamacare damn it
@matthaig1 he's such a sad clown.
the first clip's date is in the future
@MikeDrucker My god, does he EVER tell the truth? Does he just forget what he has said or does he think we are that dumb?
a liar can't change his stripes!
Still does not say within x or y days
"immediately"
@matthaig1 just maybe he has a memory problem?
@matthaig1 Hmmm. I heard him say "day 1'"
U did not. U said u would do it first thing.
One of my first acts. You edited this.  He tried but guess what? The @Gop can't get anything done.
you'd expect someone who literally published a book on making deals

to make deals
@politico To be fair, he didn't say exactly "w/in 64 days".
Is there a link to his denial? I couldn't find one
@matthaig1 he's a liar
@Reddy #Trump never gets tired of lying. #Trumpcare is a failure
World famous liar, fraud and shyster @realDonaldTrump tells a lie (ok, a bunch)? Well i never!! Good night good sir #EasyD
He came through Biggly! What a disaster!
@rob13567 short term memory loss? What an embarrassment.
He continues to lie. He thinks the American people are stupid. He will have a rude awakening.
@markos: When @realDonaldTrump finally admits he's a LIAR, then THAT'S man bites dog. Until then, it's all dog bites man. 
@moira104 Duh!
Excuses excuses ... He is well practiced at losing. A shame his base didn't see it. But they will. #TrumpLoser
"On day one..."
@politico and Jared is skiing like nothing happen.  Arrogance was not part of the job application.  @realDonaldTrump
Sabotage by GOP is the reason  ACA premiums rose & Insurance Companies fled. Read This
insurance companies were not satisfied with the profit. under ACA they had to actually pay claims.
Great video! Trump constantly said repeal and replace! Liar, liar, liar.
I'm pretty sure he said day one.
@BROADUS it's on his twitter page right now
At some point he's going to have to start claiming multiple personalities..because he's quickly running out of scapegoats
#repealdontreplace #medicaidpaysforthat #FullRepeal
@politico  serial liar
@politico I guess the failure belongs to Paul Ryan
@politico again he is caught
"10/12/17"? Hasn't happened yet! Check your dates!
@politico Who knew health care was so complicated and so hard to get a consensus.
@politico :trump said "FIRST THING"!  Just more LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES nothing new!!
@NYisBLUE back pedal much Donald? Have a nice golf game in need Florida this weekend

@politico So what happened to his Great negotiating skills?

@politico no,you said on day ONE. LMAO.
@politico only problem is that he doesn't even listen to his past self
@politico No, he said day #1.

#IMPEACHDONALDTRUMPNOW

always back tracking when r ppl gonna learn he's full shit & lies
@VoteAngryNow 45 just lies about every damned thing. He can't possibly think people have the memory impairment he does.
@politico This is what a bloviating habitual liar looks like.
@realDonaldTrump nope you said on day one. What a loser. Can't wait for your impeachment. #ACAworks
@markos What a liar! @POTUS
@politico TRUMP is such a liar. He has no political understanding of the processes of a functional govt.
@politico correct, he said he would do it in the first week.
It was those pesky Representatives from Bowling Green!
@politico suck it orange man...roflmao...have a great weekend everybody!!!!
we demand healthcare for all!
What else should we expect at this point?  Sad.
@markos If he says it, its false
He also said "everyone" would be covered for "everything" but then proposed #AHCA. #TrumpCareFail
@politico True, he promised repeal and replace on DAY ONE.
@markos Let's put this on a loop.
@politico @realDonaldTrump #DONNIE! America is NOT SO STUPID we would forget what you have endlessly repeated!
@politico as a Brit, watching this is brilliant! Half your nation must have heads buried in hands! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@politico someone's pants are completely engulfed in flames
@politico Damn that video technology
@politico REALLY? Not what I heard.
@politico Pants on fire 
@politico Here we go, back down the rabbit hole
@politico No, he said on day one! 
@realDonaldTrump somebody really ought to get this guy up to speed on the internet...it never forgets.
@politico  L.
 O.  L......
@politico ..........and the lies continue.
@politico What's UR definition of "Immediately", as it pertains 2 Politics? Get back w/me on that.... STOP THE PROPAGANDA!
@politico You said ON DAY ONEAnother lie
@politico First clip says 10/12/17.... Hopefully he'll be gone by then.
Well to be fair, that was all before anyone knew how complex healthcare actually is... 
@politico comedy gold #Trumpcare #Chumpairshot
@politico trump liar liar u don't have memory u have to go to a asylum
@politico @realDonaldTrump The only good thing you've done is pull this bill today & not leave millions uninsured.
@politico @realDonaldTrump's short & long term memory issues continue to show his ineffectivemess at leadership.
@politico I still think this is Ryans fault. Trump still never said 64 days. Very fast quickly same day. Still has time
however, he's no longer on the quoted first day, possibly the first hour!?
@politico See how fast he back pedals. Like we have no memory--and no video evidence to the contrary.
Technically true, he said he'd do it on day one.
@politico what a joke he is
@politico No. He said Day One!!!!!
@politico that didn't prove he said it within 64 days and obama care does need reform but no #ACHC
@politico No, you said repeal & replace DAY ONE! Lier-in-chief
@politico @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ...In your face So-called president/Fake-president! Go back to Russia now!
not exactly 64 days, but i believe he did say within 2 months
@politico this man is a joke...
Except it isn't funny.
This guy lies a lot!!
In terms Trump might understand "You just scored a double bogey" Mr. deal maker.
@politico it's much to easy for this man to lie.
@politico I thought he said he would repeal it on day one.
Trump is now the king of writing checks that the GOP cant cash. The only thing he's replaced is his ass with the GOP.
Pathetic. The worst is the social and political cost of his failed policies. Chaos & suffering just to fatten pockets of the 1%
this so called replacement was really about the 1%.
@politico.  
What? Trump LIES?
on live TV, in front of million witnesses
Who knew it was so complicated? Uh…
