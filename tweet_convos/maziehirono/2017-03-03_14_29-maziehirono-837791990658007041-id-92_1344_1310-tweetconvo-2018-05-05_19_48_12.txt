Inquiring minds want to know: name one thing congressional Ds are willing to work on, on a bipartisan basis, now.  I am at a loss.
@SenateDems HAVE BEN CAUGHT EITH THERE HANS IN THE COOKEY JAR voter backlash 2018 and beyond undermine the Presidency of US
@SenateDems Not the party of JFK: Obama's AG Loretta Lynch Need more marching, blood, death on streets
Dems should work with GOP the same way they did during 8yrs.
Seriously? @SpeakerBoehner & @SenateMajLdr  Caved to Dems GOP  fear MSM they don't fear (R) voters BIG MISTAKE
How about investigating Obama interfering w/ our election & Israel's. How about the wire tapping Obama ordered  for  James Rosen?
@SenateDems and impeachment see there's 2
Can't wait till 2018 to cast my vote AGAINST you. I hope you lose your seat. Seem more worried about Russia than Hawaii. #MAGA
All the nutcase Senators are trying to make a name, but what they are really doing is showing their lack of brain
How have Dems cared  - shoving the ACA mess down our throats, fewer jobs, hirer taxes, more f-stamps, welfare?
trump advisor having a meltdown
deleted tweet. Trump advisor admitting to #russiagate #trumprussia
We already had an investigation. They said Russia didnt interfere in the elections. Youre a dumb senator elected by dumb people
No, we didn't. Please grow a brain cell.
Yes we did. It was a bipartisan committee that concluded there was no evidence Russia influenced the outcome of the election
Nope. You are delusional. Or a liar. You tell me.
@SenateDems If Pres election was hacked/manipulated, is it a reach to say Congressional elections probably were too?
I believe the Democrats should do what the Republicans did. As much cooperation as they  showed Obama
but then we are no better than them
they are working on dismantle areas of government and take away our rights. Standing against them is right!
but not to be like them. If we protest and yell, aren't we no better than the tea party. Also, they disbanded
if we grow complacent people will die.
thats not the point. the resistance is the Liberal tea party.
are you OK with no more freedom of speech and Freedom of religion? Both are under attack.
no but, I don't think criticizing everything trump does is the abswer
@SenateDems RT if you want an investigation on a pile of cash on a pallet delivered to Iran. #justsaying
Yes. Why would they want an investigation on something that was already proved to be a hoax.
@SenateDems or sitting POTUS spying during general election
@SenateDems the only thing thing that you don't like about Putin he's against NWO and for real democracy.
WHY ON GOD'S EARTH WOULD ANYONE WANT TO WORK WITH JOHN CORNYN?????????????/
@SenateDems its WAY more plausible that Obama had Trumps phones tapped than it is the Russians hacked the election.
@SenateDems @JohnCornyn 
Absolutely nothing! Obstruct, divert attention, lie, confuse, create havok, boycott Anything to derail
yes! Urgently see the need for this!
@SenateDems While your at it find out how private citizens were recorded by US intelligence agencies and tapes sent 2 the press
@SenateDems democrates are the new communist party against American people,  you get more honesty from the Russians
.@maziehirono @noiserawker @JohnCornyn We WON'T work on destroying the environment, education, soc sec, medicare - you're right about that.

#hacking #lying #colluding #hiding all are problems. #meeting not so much.

I agree, we should see EXACTLY HOW MUCH CLINTON MADE FROM SELLING USA URANIUM ..oh it was $30 million my bad
@SenateDems How about a comprehensive investigation into the influence of foreign govts on ALL US politicians? #Justsaying
I'm still flummoxed by the last 8 yrs of Republican obstruction.
@SenateDems They are very open to working on Trump's infrastructure bill..
@judyharless3 why are dems afraid of investigations into pelosi Clinton schumer dealings with Russia?
. That's right. Deflect.
#justsaying
@SenateDems why are you Dems so afraid of Russia? Personally, more afraid of Dems than Russia. Lots of Dems met with Russians.
Really? D"s were at a loss for 8 yrs - R"s didn't do a damn thing. Get a grip! But an Indy investigation works.
GIVE IT UP HIRONE - YOU & YOUR KNOTHEAD COLLEAGUES WILL NOT WIN ON THIS ONE - MAKING FOOLS OUT OF YOURSELVES
ha memes
@SenateDems how about Bengazi, IrS, Clinton emails etc. why so selective
@JohnCornyn Yes, we need an independent investigation. The Russians interfered with our election. Our elections are sacred.
@SenateDems what did the GOP work on the last 8 years?
@SenateDems How about you do something that might help the middle class, you pompous disingenuous partisan hacks. #justsaying
Okay fine. But, this would have never been an issue if Hillary won the White House.
Just to let you know, it was the DNC who did not follow proper security protocol, and they got hacked.
That is why Hillary's information got leaked out; it was their own fault.
Hilary isn't POTUS. She no longer holds any office AND the investigated her adnauseum. #Trumprussia
@SenateDems @JohnCornyn there's more corruption in the Democratic Party than anyone can imagine.
@SenateDems we want an investigation into #AwanBrothers and @DWStweets and @RepSpeier asking for sec clearance #DCBreakIns
@SenateDems @JohnCornyn that's not something out can work on. How about a independent prosecutor to investigate the dem party.
#hacking #lying #colluding #hiding all are problems. #meeting not so much.
Mahalo!
@SenateDems Вы, К Демократии - О Российском Вмешательстве - Взываете...? Вижу Вопрос Ваш, Остался Гласом Вопиющего - В Пустыне.
They spent 7 years refusing to work with Dems or Obama now they complain when the shoe is on the other foot???
@SenateDems only if there is an investigation addressing the #Obama admin interference in #Israel #democracy.
@SenateDems Democrats shld work with them EXACTLY the same amount they worked with Dems.
@SenateDems How about the investigation on Hillarys hidden emails...
get over it.. Congress did for a year . You just have a hard on for Hillary
How about an independent investigation into that plane load of cash sent to Iran in the middle of the night??? #hypocrite
*Full of money that we stole* *so they don't become a nuclear power*
@SenateDems AH
@SenateDems Remember when Obama was in the Whitehouse? What goes around comes around.
How about an independent investigation into the Clinton Foundation?
the Clinton foundation gives out 80 per cent that's about 80 per cent more than Trump's.
@SenateDems 
bringin' it!
RT if  you want an independent investigation of US's interference in other countries democracies? #Justsaying
Damn. Senator Cornhole just got owned.
