What wrong with you? It's already unaffordable for millions of ppl now!
Fake news. Under Obamacare, people already can't afford healthcare.
ACA has reduced the number of people without healthcare in the USA by a factor of two: http://nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr1405667 ….
#GrahamCassidy would more than reverse ACA coverage gains, & take healthcare away from 32 million Americans by 2027:
That ACA is not perfect is _not_ a reason to reverse it or to gut Medicaid, which is what GrahamCassidy would do.
#GrahamCassidy would kill 20,000 Americans in 2019, rising to 39,000 killed per year by 2027: http://annals.org/aim/article/1867050/changes-mortality-after-massachusetts-health-care-reform-quasi-experimental-study ….
Tell your Senators & Rep to oppose #GrahamCassidy, and to #SaveTheACA & #SaveMedicaid, to prevent the mass death of Americans.
Then tell them to work for actual universal healthcare for the USA, such as #MedicareForAll, so that everyone can get the care they need.
So people can wait for healthcare.....like Canada? You realize that Canadians come here for good care right? #getaclue
#GrahamCassidy appropriates $15 trillion to medicaid and high risk individuals. How much would you like? #federalism
And with that amt of $, EVERYONE in US could have coverage with one payer system!See http://who.int  if truly interested in hlthcare

And, please keep in mind, that article WAS 30 years ago-about the time Pres Reagan came out with DRGs that TOTALLY changed healthcare paymt
1payer is a goal we should all strive for but it is a path to work toward incrementally. Otherwise we risk hyperinflation. ACA puts the
burden on providers inequitably. regulations and business taxes ensure that healthcare becomes a burden to someone at sometime. We need to
shore up medicaid, medicare, and install federalized high risk pools. Deregulate the middle income system and let free market forces work to
solvency. Only when the market can withstand that huge influx of government spending will 1payer be responsible. In the mean time we can
@LindseyGrahamSC Vote YES ON HOUSE BILL
but you want to provide healthcare for illegals? if you really cared about Americans, you would make sure our tax money helps us first
So it's just like the ACA?
We love you and your protection of all of us, Mazie!
Health care need keeps people proactive & not codependent on Democratic slavery. You don't feed wild animals; you make them go hunt for it
I am proud of you Senator Mazie Hirono. Keep the good work. The Lord is your straight
Hospitals closing, people with critical care including children thrown out their plans, seniors denied the care they need that's ObCare 
Aloha Senator @maziehirono YOU need to act now to ensure Americans have REAL healthcare. We'll talk in your office 9/28  #Rally4LungCancer
Ironic, since this is the reason they said they didn't like Obamacare
Told a group of 30 Arizonans to call their Senators today about this. Only 2 could name their Senators. One is extremely famous. Dismayed.
How exactly does killing people MAGA?
Trump claims Americans First, while simultaneously pushing Absurd Healthcare Bill.
Continue to fight the conservative view of health care reform.  Insurance needs to be overhauled & pharmaceutical companies held accountable
Ahhhh Trump Care

Don't be fooled by block grant talk..they are never good...educate yourself: https://m.soundcloud.com/otepodcast/episode-2-why-we-need-to-block-block-grants … vote no! Call your 2senators & rep!
Repub senators send her well wishes & tell of family healthcare traumas AND still want 2 deny HC 2 millions! Who r these people-Troglodytes!
YES - Those millions include my wife and my self! #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
A true leader will not complain yet is willing to find a solution.Gather a few DNC & work with RNC in order to find a solution
DNC & RNC should work together to create a better ACA.No one is willing to step up to the plate.
You tell them girl, we're behind you AND we're praying for you. Aloha 
Please fight to destroy this horrible GOP Trumpcare. NO to repeal.
Cassidy-Graham Bill is just a "GOP'S LEGAL WAY" to KILL MILLIONS OF SICK & OLD PEOPLE. GOP doesn't want to keep them alive. SIMPLE. PERIOD!
This administration wants us to die to reduce the population! Hitler reborn???
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC they want to kill millons of Americans @jaketapper @JoyAnnReid @SenWarren @Lawrence @ChrisCuomo @AliVelshi
Most people do not even know this is happening...media coverage a must...where is AARP and the others who represent those is perils
@RepTomEmmer @RepErikPaulsen @RepJasonSmith Take note: Here's heroism, integrity, compassion & dignity. A true American. #belikemazie
#WEthePEOPLE GIVE ALL TO #REPS=WE EVEN ALLOW THEM TO BREAK THE #LAW(sitting behind locked doors making laws with corps)=#ALEC!
Under the ACA millions are still uninsured and more millions can't afford care because deductibles are do high. #singlepayer.
#NoCassidyGraham CALL, CALL, CALL red alert even if in Cali all calls marked #NoCassidyGraham American healthcare not healthcare, tax break
No doubt #mcconnellrapacity behind this he needs a tax break making 20mil while in cong not enough, #REVOLUTION #MEDICARE4ALL

@SenJohnMcCain @senmarcorubio @SenSusanCollins @lisamurkowski @SenateDems @SenateMajLdr  Our lives are at risk. Vote No!
I like your style Senator Hirono.
But those people are mostly poor. @GOP doesn't work for them. The wealthy need tax breaks.
Thank you!

AVA it's lies it's all lies from the beginning Barack Obama passed the ACA with lies all lies we can't trust you it's all lies
Cassidy's doing this => #KochBrothers but don't understand why @LindseyGrahamSC wants to kill more Americans. Is he getting blackmailed?
No he's not getting black mailed they are aiming for a pure country and in order to do get that they must kill the weak! EVIL BEINGS
