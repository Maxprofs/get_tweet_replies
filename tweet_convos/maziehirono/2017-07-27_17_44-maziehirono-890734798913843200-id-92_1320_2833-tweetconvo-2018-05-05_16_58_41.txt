Why didn't @maziehirono receive a standing ovation? Her presence was just as important as @SenJohnMcCain.
I agree, we need to support positive women in government that recognizes the strength we bring to our society.
PATHETIC LYING SENATOR HAS BEST HEALTHCARE IN THE WORLD AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE & BLOWS OFF WORKING CLASS AMERICA GIVING THEM CRASHING OBAMACARE
You are my hero @maziehirono. Such wisdom and grace. We are blessed to have you in position.
It's alarming that her cancer story hasn't received the kind of attention that McCain's has. Chris, thanks for having her on! #WomenCountToo
It's not just alarming, it's offensive.

We love you @maziehirono . Thank you for your heroism.
You are amazing!!!! Thank you for everything.
Thank you Senator for your bravery! Very proud to be a woman today thx to you!!!
If I had the health coverage ya'll have, I'd be happy too!
Thanks for your vote last night Sen. Hirono.  Both of you set examples how to conduct life after being diagnosed with cancer.

Thank you, @maziehirono.
Senate #Republicans / #GOP will attempt ANOTHER #Obamacare Repeal -  Reported on Saturday, July 29, 2017 @politico -
The US needs an #NHS. It is what I love & am most proud of about the UK & right now I'm not proud of much.
Sen. Hirono's personal story was an amazing testament of strength and transparency that makes a GREAT LEADER. HONESTY. McCain listened.
Health is a basic human right, not a privilege for the wealthy.

Thank you for sharing your journey with us and I wish you a speedy recovery.
Senator Hirono, you are in my prayers and thanks for fighting so hard for the ppl.
Prayers for a courageous woman we are with you
A brave woman who did not back down
Thank you Sen @maziehirone. You were amazing last night. 
& Gratitude for your work on our behalf Senator
@allinwithchris Cancer SUCKS #MazieHironoWillWinHerBattle
Thank you, Senator!
Mazie, you are one strong women.
thank you for hanging in there Senator. God's speed in your recovery.
Exactly why we need GOOD health care...oh wait Mcaine has that ,not us
God bless you mam
Senator thank you for your compassion & leadership.  You were amazing & had me tears.  Bravo!
Beautiful oratory and testimony on the Senate floor this evening.  Thank you.
& @MazieHirono has reacted w/ honor & caring.She didn't get standing ovation,but then she didn't vote to rip health care away from millions.
Thank you Sen @maziehirono for fighting for all of us! My thoughts & prayers to you on your own health battle! Stay strong & fierce!
Thank you, Senator. For your bravery and your heart. Best wishes to you.
And if it werent for Ds exempting urselves u reps wld be covered under ACA & cld see first hand what crap insurance it really is
So true!

Only one of you is a true hero.  Thank you Senator Hirono!
So ignorant to say will suffer with any plan G.O.P. comes up with. ACA is a failure.  Most go bankrupt with any serious illnes
Brave American and ethical woman!
@maziehirono &@SenJohnMcCain America wishes you both the best of care and health. Please return the kindness & allow that same care to us.
Wish the best 4 Senator Hirono.  Maybe if those in Congress & their families didn't get health insurance they'd have different perspective.
I had no idea Senator! My prayers are with you for healing and strength during your illness. We appreciate all your efforts for democracy!!
@SenJohnMcCain then #VoteNO to stop millions of Americans from suffering! Stop this procedural charade!!
I'm proud that you're my Senator, Mazie! Thank you. Take care.
@msnbc @SenateGOP how can YOU disrespect @SenJohnMcCain struggle by voting to take away cancer screenings? U have sisters, mothers, friends!
Thank you Senator for your dedication and service to our country. I'm praying for your healing.
Inspiring woman!

Mazie, thank you for your hard work in the health care fight, despite your own health battle. I wish you all the best.
So glad you had Sen Hirono on tonight. Thoughts/prayers with her-such a strong responsible woman. Thank you Senator. #inners
Check out real info on mms - mix of sodium chlorite and an acid like citric - combine to make chlorine dioxide.  Few drops is a dose - works
Stay strong. And thank you. Btw, did you get the same standing ovation or is that just for white republican men?
You are a warrior #Hirono!!
Lyme disease isn't even really recognized much as a disease, and it is pretty much the bacterial equivalent of HIV/AIDS.  It stinks.
You are a hero. Thank you for coming to help ALL Americans. What say you @SenJohnMcCain. Just came to beat us down. No hero there.  #evil
The bill is a "fraud" and a "disaster" but will vote yes anyway? Senate Republicans  playing "tag, you're it" with our  healthcare?
Senator Hirono is No Ka Oi!!! Thank you for speaking out.
Thank you for fighting for the American ppl's healthcare Senator Hirono! Best wishes on a full recovery.
The interview with Mazie Hirono was great. Thank you Mazie for fighting for all of us!
Best of luck with your treatment.  Sending good thoughts.

May I add that you are also an example of how the people elected to represent people actually do represent them? Good health to you!
So....what are my odds that in the morning my cancer in remission is a pre existing condition again?
Mahalo nui loa Senator @maziehirono . Malama pono
Buy fewer iPhones.
yeh...glad he ejected himself from the government!  Good riddance Jason Chaffetz. 
But you do the right thing. @SenJohnMcCain not so much.
Ladies rule!
Best wishes on your fight. Thanks fir fighting so hard for us. 
But one of you cares about other people and one doesn't.
Americans deserves the same healthcare that we pay for for you @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP we will have the same healthcare we give you. NOW!
Well at least you're not stuck with the health care you're giving us
She's a Warrior!
i am actually watching live tonight.  She is an amazing woman.     and it was a great segment.
oooo....opened the door real wide on that one didn't she...?
