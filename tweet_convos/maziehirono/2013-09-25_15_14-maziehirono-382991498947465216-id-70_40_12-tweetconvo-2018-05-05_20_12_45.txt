@maziehirono, I echo you ma'am!
@maziehirono @SenateDems  Bull Crap. Real women are sick of your fake war on women. The real war is the loss of jobs your party is causing.
@maziehirono no it doesnt. Obcare causes women to lose jobs. Why dont u listen to american ppl?  If u wld u wld vote yes for bill on mon
@maziehirono @SenateDems Funding Obamacare hurts economy, single parents, 40 hour week, people's privacy, doctor's jobs, small businesses...
@maziehirono pure dishonest manipulation--read the book, know the game. More women in poverty bc of Obama & obamacare -- there's your war
.@maziehirono @SenateDems Except for all those millions who are still uninsured under ACA. And the 500,000 kids who lose coverage under it.
@maziehirono but u dont have to worry about this bc u dont have to have obamacare. Do u realize how much u sound lije a hyprocrite
@maziehirono get ur head out of the sand it is going to cost women more. People are already having their premiums go up & their hrs cut.

@maziehirono if the LAW is so Great, I suggest YOU as a WOMAN be the First to sign up!  Oh wait you excepted yourself  WHY???????
@maziehirono that is an OUT AND OUT lie!
.@maziehirono NO Cloture! If ObamaCare is so great, WHY are you exempt. DC needs #listeningSessions.
@maziehirono NO on cloture
@maziehirono BS it hurts everyone but you who are exempt. STOP the lies we have had enough. We are humans not relegated to gender alone.
@maziehirono @SenateDems 
I'm sure something could be done to replace this Crappy Law that hurts so many more people and businesses. DUH

@maziehirono That is a lie. You want someone else to pay for you. Planned Parenthood gives contraceptives free, also free check-up.

@maziehirono Defunding Obamacare hurts EVERYONE! Do your job and protect Americans & the citizens of Hawaii. #DefundObamacare #MakeDCListen
@maziehirono Only way I'll ever be happy with obummercare is when our representatives are forced to take it too.
@maziehirono not defunding it hurts all Americans and the country as a whole.
@maziehirono @SenateDems Useservices out there already. Comm clinic, health dept, WIC, VA, medicaid. Redirect, NO new Fed layer
@maziehirono @SenateDems Think for yourself instead of following Reid like a puppy dog.
@maziehirono @SenateDems Nice spin, but obcare is not good for the country and 70% DO NOT want it!!
@maziehirono @SenateDems If obcare is so good, why are you exempt??
@maziehirono @SenateDems Freedom is NOT achieved by dependence on the Federal Gov.
@maziehirono @SenateDems you foolish women. Dems are play America.
@maziehirono @SenateDems...bullshit it does..wait and see how much problems it will cause you stupid just wait. Karma is a bitch.
@maziehirono Socialized healthcare AKA ACA kills jobs for everyone including Women. We are all #Americans
@maziehirono @SenateDems oh really well my Heath insurance just went up 16.77% !! Tell me why I should pay more out of pocket ???
@maziehirono @SenateDems that's funny....I just checked my benefits for 2014 and my maternity care just got WORSE!!!! #thetruth #defundit

@maziehirono #MakeDCListen Not true. I'm a woman and have had health ins I LOVED for over 30 yrs. now I can't afford it!
@maziehirono True leaders led by actions so Senator when are you and your staff signing up for #Obamacare?
@maziehirono Just trot out babies & that makes this scandalous "law" ok. Ask NH! Insurance prices rising daily!! Make #obamacare STOP!NOW!
@maziehirono @SenateDems Typical liberal lies.
@maziehirono and when those poor women find out that their  HC will cost them 20K they'll be chomping at the bits at Democrats. @SenateDems
@maziehirono @SenateDems Oh quit with the fake war on women.  Getting tired of hearing the Dems whine today on CSPAN.
