@SenatorBarb Hold up a sign that says 'fire our representatives'. All of you care more about lobbying than helping the American populace.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer Aren't there 20 women in the Senate? Do you gals have a sign for the #VAScandal? Or is that a phony scandal too?
@SenatorBarb I thought this was a pic of the female wrestlers
.@SenatorBarb @maziehirono Stop destroying America. You'd really be doing something.
@inspectorlawyer @SenatorBarb @maziehirono Stop destroying America. You'd really be doing something.
“@SenatorBarb & friends: Standing shoulder to shoulder with women of the Senate to say enough - #BringBackOurGirls! ”
@amyklobuchar @SenatorBarb  Quit #clowning around & being politically correct. Deny #corrupt govt officials & their families access 2d #West
@SenatorBarb @Sanddragger I wish you cared when they were burning churches & killing Christian girls!
@Sanddragger 
Hey @SenatorBarb how bout bringing back our Marine held in Mexico, or the US pastor being held in Iran, or help our kids?
@ChiefG4LSU @chris63414391 @Sanddragger @SenatorBarb Because they are all out of hashtags.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer Where was your concern when Hillary wouldn't designate Boko Haram a terrorist organization?
“@SenatorBarb: Standing shoulder to shoulder with women of the Senate to say enough is enough - #BringBackOurGirls! ”.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer If you had shown as much concern for the male victims of Boko Haram, perhaps these girls would be safe.
@SenatorBarb  #BringBackOurGirls They aren't yours. Slavery is illegal now. Plus a hashtag doesn't do anything for them.
@SenatorBarb @Sanddragger Barbara do you really believe only women want the girls back  this isn't  a women's issue this is for humanity
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer Enough is enough? Where were you when 59 schoolboys were being burned alive? Is male life worth less to you?
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Islamic Terrorists are not afraid of hashtags & tweets, send in the Navy Seals if you really want to get them back
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Sounds disingenuous since our girls probably never had contact with pretentious westerners preening for the camera
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Our girls? Do you mean American girls? OR gender empathy and projecting to unite feminists in some bizarro way?
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid It''s their girls I see no Nigerian sisters in this photo-op. Only when women are threatened the left want action.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer
@SenatorBarb Why does the card game Old Maid cone to mind after seeing this
Why don't you care about the boys who were gunned down, had their throats slashed or were burned to death?  @SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid All white and the children are black. 'our girls' has a Jerry Springer slobberknocker written all over it.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid scum bags into our country , take our tax money and support them overseas why? your all a damn joke!
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid muslims are raping and selling children in the u s and you do nothing! you clowns are pathetic !  you let these
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid clueless libtards .
@SenatorBarb @Sanddragger if that doesn't scare terrorist, nothing will! Keep cutting defense spending!
@SenatorBarb More "Black" babies are Killed in New Your then are born...SAVE OUR NEW YORK BABIES!!!! #saveourgirls #DNC #ABC #CBS #NBC
@SenatorBarb @Sanddragger 
It would be less of a line on nonsense
had the sign said 
#bringbackthegirls 
KEY WORD: "The"
Not YOURS!
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid what about our men killed in Benghazi? U have no problem with that. Bring their murderers to justice. #stupidcow
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid #BringBackOurGirls this is the Obama foreign policy,it creates bold moves of terrorism all around the world,sad
@SenatorBarb @MoniqueAziza Did you do that for our Ambassador Chris Stevens & our other Men ?? #Benghazi
@SenatorBarb @maziehirono Terrorists do not respond to hashtags. But a smoldering hole in the ground with their assailants  sure would.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid typical libturd diplomacy: Twitter. If only you care as much about 4 dead AMERICANS in Benghazi as this fake crap!
@SenatorBarb Thank you for your leadership on behalf of women and girls everywhere
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Exactly how does your hashtag help those girls other than making you feel good about yourself? You're pathetic.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid
To opportunist politicos on #bringbackourgirls bandwagon...
how 'bout the US Marine held in Mexico? #getoffyourass
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid @BarackObama #impeachobama #WakeUpNow #WakeUpAmerica
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Hypocrites all, never a mention of the horrendous treatment of women by Islam? Cause celeb , that's ok.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Yes, I agree, and while you are at it; bring back our government...seems it was kidnapped as well..
Seriously: @SenatorBarb @SenatorReid who notices the #hastag when it's surrounded by the bevy of beauties in the #dem party! 

Bwahahaha
Wow, if a stupid Hashtag tweet is the best you can come up with, maybe you should keep it to yourself.  @SenatorBarb @SenatorReid
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Shameful that American leadership has been reduced to tweeting pics of handwritten signs... Watch out world!
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Of course it would have been nice if you stood shoulder to shoulder with Connie Rice too.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid These are the people who want to take your guns so you can defend yourself with a #Hastag  #2A
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid How much energy do @TheDemocrats spend on grand gestures of no value that don't move toward a solution?
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid #BringBackOurHealthCare
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Obama backs extreme muslims - Harry Reid backs Obama and all John Kerry could say is they should offer health ins.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid How about taking care of our own? Put it on your agenda! You have homeless vets here to help!
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid #JusticeforOurBoys #JusticeforBenghazi #Benghazi
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Standing is one thing. Action is another.
@AmConCon Why do you think the GOP wants to stay out of it, because they are Black and female, GOP's favorite to hate on #BringBackOurGirls
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid this is so stupid. These people in power can do a lot more. But they don't care, it's a PR stunt.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid why BOKO HARAM is only after Christ ?
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid fight for biafran freedom not this stage lies.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid  #BringBackOurGirls This kind of passion would have been good in saving our white American men in #Benghazi #liars
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid I'm sure the subhumans that took the girls will hand them over immediately thx to your teenage Twitter diplomacy.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid SENATOR MIKULSKI YOU ARE A DISGRACE.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid  VERRY GOOD (!)  teo emeritus FRÄMMESTAD sweden  http://www.teo.just.nu 
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid I'm sure Boko Haram is frightened by your hashtag sign. Is this the best America can do - hashtag selfies?
Are you really the meanest Senator, @SenatorBarb?

That's pretty darn impressive.  

@SenatorReid
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid How are you bringing back? Take a chartered flight to Nigeria to bring them back?
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid I want a million dollars.  Maybe if I hashtag it I can make it happen.    #letsdomore
@SenatorBarb @SenatorReid Yeah, that should do it
“@SenatorBarb - #BringBackOurGirls!”
Hashtag diplomacy. Sick and sad. 
America deserves better.
@SenatorBarb
@SenatorBarb #BringBackOurGirls is funded by poaching - 40% - if we ban all ivory trade we save elephants from extinction #signforelephants
@SenatorBarb @CantwellPress Do something about not use titter.
@RogerOler @SenatorBarb @CantwellPress Gee Roger do you think you could post anything more inappropriate? It ur thinking that causes this
@SenatorBarb thank you for caring
@SenatorBarb Thank you all for everything you can do to help those young women.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer - FYI, actions speak louder than hashtag photos.
@SenatorBarb @SenatorBoxer maybe you ladies could stand together and demand a vote for UE! #RenewUI
@SenatorBarb Send US spec ops into Kenya when Muslims are being killed and nothing when Muslims are doing the killing. U do the math!
@SenatorBarb Thanks for sharing that update - it's now live here: http://rbl.ms/1hpTfzJ
