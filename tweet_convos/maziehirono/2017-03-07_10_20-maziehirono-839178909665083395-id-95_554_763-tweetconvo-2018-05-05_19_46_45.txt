The GOP is happy to wipe slate clean of ACA/Obama. Elderly, poor at risk.Didn't they listen to town halls at all?
No they discounted us.
@SenSchumer don't believe a word you say anymore #demhypocrites
OBAMACARE WINNERS:  NO ONE!!!
LOSERS: ALL WORKING AMERICANS
losers are the American people every time the "Government" uses policy to control our lives.  Less gov = Happy people
I disagree with a hefty chunk of #Republicare, but the tanning thing makes sense in context.
@SenSchumer  HC would go down if we weren't giving FREE HC to ppl who broke into our country!

Were your high fees due to Obamacare or the insurance company?
why are premiums higher in Arizona?
It was middle class and muchof the poor that voted for #Trump. Without voter fraud of illegals and dead people like #Hillary
@SenSchumer @politico defend that please.  You haven't paid for your own health care for a while Hugh.  #hypocrite
NOT TRUE!That's what ObamaCare did. Obamacare decieved women &took money from everyone for the few, into Obamas own pocket!!!
FALSE! ...and she doesn't even know what a metaphor is. Don't bother using big words if you don't know the meaning.
@SenSchumer @politico same old line from you Democrat's, find a new one .
of course tanning industry would benefit.  That's how he gets orange
@SenSchumer @politico now be nice, don't listen to chucky
whoa hula skirt. Tanning industry could be hawaii. Why hurt you rich demtards. Send illegals to hawaii ok?
@SenSchumer @politico that's not a metaphor
@SenSchumer @politico I would hardly take Politico's word as definitive on the new health bill! Calm down & pass it, then read.
@SenSchumer @politico and how many poor people have medical expense accounts? That's a laugh.
@SenSchumer @politico WRONG

Does make one wonder which members of Congress own  tanning salon. Everyone knows it's not healthy and causes cancer
Don't think you get that color of orange from tanning salon. That's spray on.
@SenSchumer @politico #Trumpdoesnotcare
@SenSchumer @politico wow more comments out of Shumer's playbook. How is ACA going for your constituents?
#FakeNews
Don't forget health insurance companies who NOW can deduct CEO salaries over $500K...
@SenSchumer @politico single payer systems have lower costs, better outcomes, longer life expectancy so why can't we have this?
Lol WHAT?!?! Single payer is NOT cheaper. Also, Medicare was already collapsing.
