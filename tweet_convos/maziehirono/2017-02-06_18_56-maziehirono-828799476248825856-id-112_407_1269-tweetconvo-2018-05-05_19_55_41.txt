@SenateDems more sheep. You protect teachers unions and LIBERAL agenda. Has nothing to do with students. PERIOD
Does Sharia Law allow abortion upon request? Can Sharia Law be practiced in America?
Thank you for standing up against DEVOS #NoOnDEVOS @maziehirono @SenateDems
Thank you Senator Hirono.  Sad that so many Republicans are afraid to say "NO" to Trump.  DeVos:  ignorance in education.
Keep it up! #StopDeVos
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Hirono. Thank you for trying.
Thank you for sharing your experience w public school & standing up for excellence #NotoDeVos #holdthefloor

@SenateDems say YES
as the teachers unions bring us inline with all the other 3rd world countries
Cough Cough. You meant teachers unions,and she's for accountability for graduation rates,nice try.
@SenateDems thank you for standing up for our  kids and democracy
Go Mazie!! 
Senator @maziehirono and all elected officials, thank you for fighting against privatization of public schools #StopDeVos
@SenateDems what are you going to do now that she confirmed?
Its too late!!
Now what? Very disappointing outcome.
@SenateDems She doesn't believe in the ones providing the education. Sounds about right!
Once again, youve proved how weak & powerless U are as we Congratulate Pres Trump's confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos!
I know you believe in public ed. No member of the Senate would ever send their child to private school. Only pubs!
please say no to DeVose. If that's how you spell her name. Please vote No.
Dept of Educ(1979) & Teacher Unions = poster child of failure.  Your tweet would be laughable if it wasn't so sad.
Mazie Fights for the Teacher Unions while US Students are Last in Science & Math thanks to 8 yrs of OBAMA'S Sec ED!
The problem with public schools is the curriculum is dictated by liberals to create dependent socialist students.
Whoever believes in our public schools is blind.  12,000 dollars per year per student and internationally low results.  Idiots
thank you senator
I guess the $58,000 from the NEA to you in the last election cycle is paying off for them
DeVos definitely wouldn't have bothered with a sign language interpreter. It wouldn't have occurred to her.
@sueludad Thank you for #holdthefloor and voting #noDevos

@SenateDems
@SenateDems 

Last time I checked... 

No one has faith in our public schools!
@SenateDems you mean a soon to be secretary that will give parents control over their kids education just like college
@SenateDems, thank you!
Yes!
@SenateDems thank you all for being the voice of millions.
@SenateDems thank you senators !
I'm on board w/ uniforms.
I teach. School attire can stratify populations: haves/have nots. I attire also distracts as of late.
Educators everywhere are saying NO to #devos & we have excellent reasons as to why!  Our kids deserve better!
Thank you for standing up against DeVos. It's critically important for all American children.
GO DEM SENATORS!!!!
@SenateDems school choice. 
@SenateDems last 8 years did what for the school system?
It not schools she doesn't believe in, it's what the Federal Government has turned them into. Too many can not reed
@SenateDems thank you Senator Hirono very true and proven during the hearing Ms DeVos does not qualify at all for the position.
Get in there and find 1 R colleague w/an ounce of integrity and #StopDeVos
@SenateDems Public Ed teachers a lot of good teachers TOO many bad ones can't fire TENURE law, vouchers are the way to go
@SenateDems It must be Nice to be able to .Buy a Job! DeVos is Buying the Republican Senators! Grassley got over $21000!
Grassley is a professional politician. Term limits is for another day. Up there with life pensions.
He has been getting Social security For Years too!
@SenateDems I don't believe in our public schools brainwashing  Social justice is more important to you nitwits then education
@SenateDems Try hearing the DeVos supportERS for once
What is happening right now is so incredible and AWESOME! Democracy in action. Thank you!
@SenateDems Thank you so much!
Thank you for standing up for what is right for our future!
You are a star, Sen Hirono.  Thanks for standing up to unqualified autocrats!
@SenateDems @maziehirono public education only works if teacher salaries are tied to performance.  Labor unions are jobs programs.
@SenateDems Betsy DeC is Does believe in our public schools. Just not the waste

@brianschatz it's offensive she had so little respect for the position that she figured she could wing it through hearing
