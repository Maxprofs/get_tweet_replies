That's cuz he doesn't care about truth, facts, justice, integrity. He's unAmerican & works against our interests.
No, thats because she broke Senate rules. Geez, at least know what your talking about if you're going to weigh in.
Take your own advice. Stop watching Fox News and maybe you'll learn what the rules are.
he let 2 men read it aloud, though
Denying @SenWarren the right to speak doesn't negate the fact that Sessions is racist #LetLizSpeak #StopSessions
But he's not though lol. Proven that he's not. Move on...
We've seen his Senate voting record; we know exactly who he is.
Right. So by that metric you must think @HillaryClinton is. Plus her KKK friends too.
Not about HRC. Sessions record is Anti-LGBT, Anti-Women, Anti-voting rights
True. But please tell me you don't. Since it'd be super hypocritical.
And @jeffsessions desegregated the schools. Just saying.
mcconnell has proven time and time again that he is the worlds biggest coward.  and has no spine.  never has.
. You love to see Americans hurt and you laugh? Wtf
Did you forget your meds today?
Don't look!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE nominate Loopy Lizzie for Pres in 2020.  I love winning. #maga
@bresla_linda @SenateMajLdr 
Agreed. The world knows he's bigot as much as corretta does
@WokeConstituent @SenateMajLdr this is the end of the GOP for me! How dare they stand her down! #TheResistance
Simple, she violated Senate rules she swore to obey, rules in effect for 200 yrs.
@iVote4USA @SenateMajLdr Except Sessions was defending black people in that case against other black people who committed VF.
Can you please ask @SenateMajLdr how Senate "decorum" is being violated when another Senator is trying to advise & consent?
Let's let Liz speak.  Support the #LetLizSpeak Movement!  ;-)
what has stopped him and his party from denying things they can't deny before now?
@joh53293471 @SenateMajLdr The only thing he did was make himself look like a damn fool.
Sen Pocahontos used her fake race for own gain  & calls Sessions bigot racist. Shameful !
I do believe #LizSpeaksWithForkedTongue, Kemosabe.
The ltr was abt voter suppression, if Sessions becomes head of the DOJ everyone should be afraid
it was case of black officials filed complaint against other blacks for voter fraud.
And your evidence of that assertion?? Or are you pulling #alternativefacts out of your ass?
Thank you too Senator for speaking out! Plz continue to do so! God help our country! @TazKHC @SenateMajLdr
@KamalaHarris Dems expected to lose 8-10 Senate seats in 2018 in states where Trump vote was 60%+ #americaFirst
@CitizensFedUp @SenateMajLdr #do u@protevt@your wife's family criminality ? U are
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr That is so true!

#ShePersisted
@SenWarren Party& People of Slavery,Jim Crow,KKK, never once made such accusations agnst Sen Robert Byrd-KKK member for decades
I am #TheResistance
Ironic that his behavior is one of over the top disrespect.
.@maziehirono @SenateMajLdr The entire @GOP knows Sessions is a racist - they just thought a little misogyny would hide it. #Backfired
By the time that the people that voted for Trump finally wake up we will have a dictatorship.They will blame Dems
Nevertheless we persist
thank you for speaking up @SenWarren #ShePersisted
now what was once hidden from the multitude is public knowledge. Bravo! #letlizspeak
Another liar @maziehirono.
Court record shows Sessions fought for black citizens against Progressive Dem voter fraud.
Appalling lack of democracy. Shows you that #McConnell is a bigoted woman hater. HE (McConnell) IS THE PROBLEM!
the same Dems who have done a superb job of destroying the black culture and they r slowly catching on. #maga

The video of the exchange is bizarre. Clearly the GOP trying to censor Warren, making it up as they go.
https://mobile.twitter.com/michael_at_work/status/829349969496662016 … @maziehirono
Warren:"May I continue with the letter?"
Chair:"The senator may continue."
Puppet Chair is clueless.

#DenySessions #LetLizSpeak
shhhhh! Stop whining.
and @SenateMajLdr was raring to use Rule19
@Debbielee63Lee @SenateMajLdr republicans are out of control. @elizabethforma

@AGirlHasNoPOTUS @SenateMajLdr chill the exercise of the ballot @SenSessions, #SHAME BOGUS @potus @VP
do your job and give our president his cabinet.
The Turtle played to his #whiteNationalist base and he is their new hero #resist #resistance
@CAGoldenBear @SenateMajLdr Let us all hear and discuss what Coretta Scott King wrote.  How did Sessions rise to his position?
Warren is SOOO concerned with black people, she supported team bigotry over justice candidate
@patsyfish123 @SenateMajLdr Correct! If she was wrong it's easy to rebut. He admits she's right but moves ahead. Bad MajLdr!
did u say that on the senate floor?
Read  Coretta Scott King wrote opposing Sessions's 1986 federal nomination http://wpo.st/iz7a2 
#LetLizSpeak #StopSessions
: What CSK wrote in '86 was true then, and it's true now Another Bannon racist approved by domestic terrorist GOP
put duct tape on her mouth
- Agreed! And allow this song play as she speaks!
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr paybacks are hell aren't they Mazie?
she was stopped for heaping abuse on a decent man. I believe she was warned and wouldn't stop.
#LETLIZSPEAK
What a hypocrite.
How all arguments end when 1 side is wrong and not bright - "shut up" stomp stomp stomp.
libtards
@SenateM What you expect from Conservative Racist. They support Hitler killing Jews and police killing Unarmed Black civilians
@Assholethought @SenateMajLdr

@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr #stopsessions #LetLizSpeak
she did speak and according to the "rules & vote" 50 people had enough. Whats the issue ?!?
The Intelligence Committe needs to investigate Trump and his fuckbuddy Putin. @realDonaldTrump
Who but a lying crook of the same team would believe @jeffsessions over Coretta Scott King an impeccable woman!
Of@course he can deny it. That's all they do. But he can't refute it.
Striking Coretta Scott King's words from the record doesn't change the facts. #stopsessions #wePersist @GOPSenate
@SenWarren Please post multi page document for download. McConnell's disrespect will backfire in the court of public opinion.
#letlizspeak let her speak.
#shutherupalready Libs refuse to accept consequences to their own actions. Liz made the choice to break the rule.
Powerful moment. Keep it up @SenWarren Thank you for your grace dignity & respect.
@LonestarLibChic @SenateMajLdr They stopped her from reading a citizens letter it's that simple
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr you couldn't stop Betsy DeVos and you will not stop Jeff Sessions either. #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN
@ShowMeStateKC @SenateMajLdr No he can't and that is sad
I thought MM was very articulate in siting the violation of Rule 19. Or are you conveniently leaving that out?
it shows he just as racist as @JeffSessionsrbx
turtle face HAHAHA I Love
REMEMBER this and VOTE!  @GOP
Senator Sessions Has Supported Repeal Of VRA, Has Fought LEGAL Immigration, & For Torture Of Prisoners.

@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Vote No on Sessions. He will not represent all Americans
@SenWarren @maddow SENATOR WARREN KEEP TALKING AND KEEP FIGHTING!! YOU ARE MY SHERO!!!!!
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Every Democratic Senator should take up where she left off. The letter is part of Senate Record.

@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr 
No.
Because Democrats still don't want to play by the rules.
Rule 19.
Protocol.

Do we have freedom of speech in this country?  Apparently not if you are a senator.

Coretta Scott King: "I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the KKK..."
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr what a bully for not allowing Senator Warren read kings letter.
This was crazy I'm still in SHOCK McConnell has to GO
Lib Logic: Hillary Clinton loses to Trump, push HRC 2.0 as the next great hope. At least she's Native American...

Shame on McConnell for trying to silence Sen Warren simply for opposing their nominee.
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr no surprise @MitchMcConell is one of the swamp monsters along with his buddy @SpeakerRyan
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr that was 1986 it is now 2017-very misleading.

@SenSchumer @maziehirono @SenateMajLdr You're all OBSTRUCTIONISTS!
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr McConnell doesn't care about the constitution or the people; he's filling the swamp with cronies
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr History will show him as our greatest threat to democracy. He is a self-serving scoundrel and traitor
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr They get rough when trying to hire a Nazi.
@SenateMajLdrth this isn't the last 8 years, you have to follow the rules now...
you never did. Why should we. You get zero cooperation
I respect most those who listen, even if they hold a different view.
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Fight back!  #resist
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr what are they afraid of.
