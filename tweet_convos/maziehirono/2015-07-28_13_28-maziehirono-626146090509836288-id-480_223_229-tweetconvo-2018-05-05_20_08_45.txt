Harvesting organs has Zero to do with women's health. @SenatorReid
@Gunny_Says @SenatorReid that was deunked...asshole..but keep repeating the lie
@souzi54 @Gunny_Says @SenatorReid and there is the cursing and name calling of the "tolerant" left!
@MrClarkJKent @Gunny_Says @SenatorReid anyone on the rght who keeps repeating lies is an asshole....too bad if you dont like to hear that
What exactly is the lie? Because a fact intrudes on your beliefs, doesn't make it untrue. @souzi54 @MrClarkJKent @SenatorReid
@Gunny_Says @MrClarkJKent @SenatorReid save your fascist rhetoric... for someone else...pp film debunked...stop repeating LIES
Again, what is the lie? If something I said is a lie, why are you afraid to answer that question? @souzi54 @MrClarkJKent @SenatorReid
@SenatorReid I support u and Planned Parenthood!
@holybullies @SenatorReid Need to find out if PPh gets the same price for Black baby parts as for White.  Can't have racist body part trade.
@billnhillsbong @SenatorReid I just love it when you so-called pro-lifers show your true faces.
@holybullies @SenatorReid And I just love it when you duplicitous libs show your profound ignorance.  #BlackLivesMatter Dumb Ass even Babies
@billnhillsbong @SenatorReid AND RACIST TOO!!! not surprised
@holybullies @SenatorReid PPh is attacking your race but I wouldn't expect a kool-aid drinking lib like yourself to understand that.
.@SenatorReid  It is entirely possible that the next black president died at a planned parenthood clinic. Plantation politics.
@Crapitol_Hill @SenatorReid uh talking about plantations isn't going to get u support amongst black people.
@Crapitol_Hill @SenatorReid so u feel sorry for black babies being aborted so that when we grow up u can call us porch monkeys?
@katomart @Crapitol_Hill @SenatorReid read the thread dipping into business u weren't invited to enter.
@tdbissell @katomart @Crapitol_Hill @SenatorReid oh i am SOOO hurt. did u use a dictionary to spell racist?
@SenatorReid What about the health of the babies? No one wants to close PP, we just don't want to pay for them. Should be PRIVATELY funded.
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer @healthandcents It's NOT a war on women's health! As an American I'm disgusted w/PP practices! #DefundPP
@SenatorReid Ask Senator Udall how this worked for him in 2014 Dirty harry.
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer Why then are so many women behind #DefundPP ? Maybe they see the videos for what they are - immoral and illegal.
@SenatorReid If you love PP so much, donate some of your millions to it. WE DON'T WANT TO FUND THEM!
@SenatorReid What part of a murdered, dismembered baby is covered by 
"women's health" ? #womenbetrayed
@catjon4 @SenatorReid watch and learn lady! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4IH2SRYykW8 …
@kaygesmile @SenatorReid so it wasn't a murdered dismembered baby back in the 50's either?
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer it is amazing.  Either u are completely stupid or you are a liar.  I am betting on both.
.@SenatorReid Thought #Obamacare took care of Women's Health? How you defend #PPSellsBabyParts is sickening #DeathbyDemocrats
@SenatorReid hey dingy- whats your IQ?
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer murdering the unborn and profitting on body parts. Zeig Heil. HIilter would be proud
@SenatorReid what kickbacks are you getting from murdering babies?
@SenatorReid Just an attack on a failed Govt. program like soo many others
@SenatorReid It's an attempt to stop murder. I sure am glad that my Mother is Pro-Life!
@SenatorReid @willie_mays24 Excuse my language on a Sunday, but Harry Reid is a fucking idiot. #UniteBlue #PP
@SenatorReid why would it attack women? Didn't you pass universal health care? Hospitals don't take women? What's real story Traitor Reid?
@JbushongJoey despite all the lies you have been told and obviously believed as fact, #PlannedParenthood is a healthcare provider&saveslives
@nosilentsprings videos are lies? Videos of workers helping teens get abortions are lies? My tax $ should NOT help ANY business PERIOD!
@SenatorReid The saying 'there's no fool like an old fool' appears true in your case @maziehirono
@SenatorReid really dummy? Why do we need PP? We have Obama care now!
@SenatorReid  attack just for the sake of attack..totally disregarding all the good pp does accomplish day to day...mostly in red states
@souzi54 @SenatorReid the majority of their business comes from sexually transmitted infection tests which can be done at any dr office
@SenatorReid Shame on them for trying to defund planned parenthood because of an edited video
@ColoredSpaces @SenatorReid http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/matthew-balan/2015/08/06/flashback-2000-chris-wallace-aired-undercover-report-abc-about?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=marketing&utm_term=facebook&utm_content=facebook&utm_campaign=wallace-pp …
@SenatorReid Has nothing to do with womens' health Senator.  PP has to be investigated; begin w/checking out videos, make sure legit
@62jerseygirl @SenatorReid http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/matthew-balan/2015/08/06/flashback-2000-chris-wallace-aired-undercover-report-abc-about?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=marketing&utm_term=facebook&utm_content=facebook&utm_campaign=wallace-pp …
@SenatorReid Doesn't ObamaCare cover women's healthcare? If I was concerned 4someone's health/well being,last place I'd refer them wld b PP.
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer < 2 GHOULS!!!  DISSECTING A BABY, SELLING ITS ORGANS.TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER, ISNT ABOUT WOMENS HEALTH.
@SenatorReid About 50% of aborted babies are "women."  How is saving their lives an attack on women's health?
@SenatorReid you need jesus
@alwaysonoffense @SenatorReid harry doesn't need the rep jesus when gop takes the food out of peoples mouths
@souzi54 @alwaysonoffense @SenatorReid the food will be out of everyone's mouth if the Dems keep spending like there's no end
@SenatorReid
@SenatorReid
Dear @SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer Pulling apart an unborn baby & crowing over the parts isn't #GOP defunding #healthcare #dontbuythelie
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer BULL! The health of women has 0 to do w/dismembering babies 4 organs 2 traffic.
@SenatorReid pretty sure your jagoff Angel Macaroni or w/e doesn’t give a hoot about dead baby body parts either #DefundPlannedParenthood
@SenatorReid So you approve of #PlannedParenthood selling baby parts?  Nice job of trying to take the focus off the real issue! #NVJoke
@SenatorReid @CorlessJones "women's health" is coveted by ACA, should see PCP, not an abortion mill  #ReidSupportsBabyMurderers
@SenatorReid supports selling baby parts.
@SenatorReid << F OFF! You r a miserable excuse for a human being! #WakeUpAmerica @alison_rambles
@alison_rambles @SenatorReid retire, Jackass!
@SenatorReid  Speaking of attacks sir, what about hacking up BABIES? Have you even watched any of these videos?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWQuZMvcFA8 …
@SenatorReid That sir is a LIE! Health Depts in all towns can take care of their needs plus I thought Obama Care was the answer 2 everything
@SenatorReid Hey Dirty Harry! How many of your Kids did you have Aborted?
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer This is not a GOP thing, it's national. Look at the polls and surveys and current events. Many dems are pro-life.
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer PlannedParenthood need focus only on healthcare, void abortions and especially criminal acts as selling parts.
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer It's not an attack on women's health, otherwise all American women would say so. However, most are against PP.
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer women dont need an old white dude to tell them that womens health care has to include killing the unborn
@SenatorReid I'm assuming then that you're okay with butchering babies& selling their body parts! God help you!!
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer Really guys? Really? #AnotherBoy #PlannedButcherhood
@SenatorReid not a political issue, a moral one #PPSellsBabyParts #PPShoutYourStory #crunchy #ItsABoy
@SenatorReid Have you seen the videos? In case you missed it, they are selling dead babies. Do you agree with what they are doing?
@SenatorReid 
Your a disgrace ! And when U meet your maker U will have to answer why u supported The Murder of Innocent Baby's 4 $$ politics
@SenatorReid How is dismemberment and infanticide about women's health??
@SenatorReid this is an unfair characterization of some of the people who you serve.
@SenatorReid <- oh look, a useless clump of cells chimed in on #PPSellsBabyParts
@SenatorReid No...it's a republican DEFENSE of humane LIFE.
@SenatorReid And anyone wonders why you were beat to a bloody pulp?
Nope, just common sense--why are my tax dollars funding that atrocity? Another good q--how are you still in office? @SenatorReid
@SenatorReid Keep fighting for what you know is right.  Party politics be damned.  PP is not about abortions, they are for women's health.
@SenatorReid you're a member of the #LDS church! Excommunication is too good. You sold your morals for $. Good luck in the afterlife. Repent
@janagriz @SenatorReid why should he 'repent' for doing what he knows is right?
@xinesuprna @SenatorReid harvesting baby hearts, brains & livers is never right, ghoul
@janagriz @SenatorReid citation needed... and not a heavily edited Breitbart clip
@xinesuprna @SenatorReid the full video is available, if you didn't watch it--not my problem ghoul
@janagriz @SenatorReid so then you watched it?  The unedited version?  Link please... or STFU
@xinesuprna so they edited the 2 hour and 42 minute video that's available on YouTube????
@janagriz so you watched it?
@SenatorReid @SenatorBoxer No, it's an effort to defund another Democrat murderous attack on babies. Stop your support for murder of babies!
@SenatorReid — not just an attack on women's health, but minority sexual health as well.
@SenatorReid planned parenthood is a criminal business.  You both should be in prison.
@SenatorReid Thank you for standing with PP, and for supporting women's right to reproductive healthcare, Senator!
@SenatorReid you're the bomb! #goharrygo
@SenatorReid @o1d_dude Keep the production line moving, eh Harry?
@SenatorReid And funding @PPact is just another evil step in infanticide. You are making sure Margaret Sanger's dream comes true. #DefundPP
@SenatorReid I don't understand. Why do we even need PP when everyone is supposed to be covered by ObamaCare. Answer me this!
@SenatorReid so killing children is somehow saving women? Explain that.
.@SenatorReid NO! Plans to defund #PlannedParenthood are to STOP selling butchered baby parts. WTH is wrong with you? ALL LIVES MATTER!
@BarbArn @SenatorReid   By selling aborted baby body parts, prochoice practitioners acknowledge that each tiny baby part came from a baby!
@SenatorReid he is one sick, thieving bastard
@SenatorReid this man needs aborted.. Piece by piece.. I know the piece I'd pull on first..
@SenatorReid you can view these videos and still support funding I would say makes you a far left crazy, not the folks that made the video
.@SenatorReid No, it's an attack on this #BabyParts @ppact #felony #evil
@UpInTheHills @SenatorReid @PPact If O wasn't on their side these people would be in jail. How much of the profit does he get?!
@SenatorReid Yes, you evil perverts will insist on mutilating babies and then selling their parts like a chop shop. We get that.
@SenatorReid
@SenatorReid Question:  What specific women's health care is offered exclusively by @PPact that is not covered by #ACA?
@Obomination1 @StarCoreOne02 @SenatorReid @PPact So you can't get birth control through Obamacare?  Relationships and sex?
@Obomination1 @StarCoreOne02 @SenatorReid @PPact ahh- gotcha.
@SenatorReid Isn't Obamacare supposed to provide that? How is "women's health" being substituted for "Abortion" an actual argument?
.@SenatorReid 

#PPSellsBabyParts 

#DefundPlannedParenthood
@SenatorReid really? #BlackLivesMatter except at #PlannedParenthood since they are the majority killed there
@SenatorReid 
Sending poor women to Planned Parenthood for healthcare is an attack on women AND children.
@SenatorReid 
If you were a poor woman would you like to get your healthcare at #PPact or would you like a legitimate choice?
@SenatorReid go get in a fight with another exercise band you soulless dusty corpse
@SenatorReid What would Heavenly Father think about this? Do you really think He wants His spirit children killed in the womb? Not good :(
@SenatorReid because killing babies helps fill democratic coffers. Nice.
@SenatorReid you are wrong about #DefundPP being an attack on women. You are ignorant if you refuse to see the disgusting corruption of PP
@SenatorReid you are completely evil, and vile if you actually support them. You're the joke. You need to step down!
@SenatorReid you're saying that selling the body parts of innocent aborted babies has nothing to do it? Should I imply youre ok with that?
@SenatorReid "thou shalt not kill nor do anything like unto it." Sound familiar? Abortion certainly falls within that.
@SenatorReid SELLING DEAD BABY ORGANS AND PARTS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH "WOMENS HEALTH".
@SenatorReid legal prostitution isn't the biggest embarrassment of Nevada it's Reid! He's on the Senate floor lying again as I type this.
@SenatorReid As usual Senator, you're full of crap.
@SenatorReid I'd like 2 know just what part of an abortion is healthy, & for whom? Seriously. I need an answer since you've made that claim.
@SenatorReid So glad you're out of office soon. You are a huge part of the problem. I'm pro choice to a point but sickened by this
@SenatorReid Hands up ! Don't crush !
@SenatorReid You are a despicable old fart of a politician that has no heart and obviously no soul. Shame.
@SenatorReid Really? Larry should have beat you harder. Why must I be forced to fund #lesscrunchy profits for @PPact and Dem donations?
@SenatorReid No, it isn't, you soulless, despicable skell.  It's about not wanting my hard earned money paying for killing babies.
@SenatorReid this isin no way an attack on women's health however it is Democrat's breaking the law again & getting away with it
@SenatorReid. Hitler is smiling from hell at the democrats and their #AmericanHolocaust known as abortion .
@SenatorReid I thought we fixed women's health by providing Obamacare? Are we double paying for the same thing?!
Despicable @SenatorReid says #PlannedParenthood selling baby parts is just a right wing war on Women

#FireBoehner
@jimcc66 we can not even rally around #alllifematters @SenatorReid You senator will be the cause of the next civil war.
@SenatorReid Planned parenthood is murdering innocent children. Did the children get a choice?? You need to know Jesus personallly.
.@SenatorReid I'm not a Republican and I want it stopped. Has nothing to do w/politics or women's rights, but rather human rights.
@SenatorReid AND YOU ARE A MORMON????????
@SenatorReid How can you justify encouraging the murder of the unborn in order to profit from the remains as womens health? Watch the tapes.
@SenatorReid THE attack is on theUNBORNbabies, TheBlackCommunity that Udon't give a hoot about &TheDignity of AMERICA
@HouseFloor #DefundPP
.@SenatorReid Selling brains, hearts, lungs, livers from innocent children has nothing to do with women's health. You know this. #DefundPP
@SenatorReid how much stock do you have in StemExpress??
.@SenatorReid How does it make women healthier to have their child's body parts sold for a profit? 50% of those babies are women #DefundPP
@SenatorReid such an ambiguous statement from someone who doesn't even understand what women's health is ... Sigh
@SenatorReid You need to retire!
@SenatorReid What's the bigger lie: This tweet or the idea that Harry Reid knows how to use Twitter?
@SenatorReid Democrat support of PP is just another attack on unborn children right to LIVE. Sold any body parts lately Harry?
@SenatorReid How long ago did PP buy you out Reid?
@SenatorReid Reid, this wouldnt be much of an issue if PP was not violating at least 3 federal laws. Start enforcing the law.
@SenatorReid You need this: https://www.lds.org/topics/abortion?lang=eng …
@SenatorReid stop lying
@SenatorReid you sick bastard.
@SenatorReid Don't worry, Harold, @PPact will make sure you get your thirty pieces of silver...
@SenatorReid It is a VULGAR disgusting lie that it has anything to do with a woman's health,what about her mental health later? the guilt??
@SenatorReid don't pretend you give a tinkers damn about a woman's health, laying helpless as a quack hooks a vacuum to her insides
@SenatorReid Mammograms are fantastic! Carving up fetal cadavers & selling parts for profit is not. I hope you can see the difference.
@SenatorReid How can it be a woman's body if it has DIFFERENT DNA?
@SenatorReid  U & #PELOSI never give up on the #LIES so ingrained in the #DEM party. NOT MY TAX $$ FOR $KillingUNBORN & $SellingPARTS .
@SenatorReid I'm glad you're showing @SenateMajLdr @MitchMcConnell he's a fool for giving Democrats what they want thinking they'd play nice
@SenatorReid same old radical leftist spin! 
You are a lair @SenatorReid.#PlannedParenthood is murdering babies and hurting women & you know
@SenatorReid It isn't about women's health. It is about treating a human life like a bucket of chicken and using tax dollars to pay for it.
@SenatorReid yes nothing to do with #AllLivesMatter
@SenatorReid What does genocide have to do with women's health?
@SenatorReid is against a woman's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
@SenatorReid Stupid attack on GOP is lame. You have no decency; have you no shame? Have you actually seen the vids?NOT about women's health!
@SenatorReid Which women? Oh, not the defenseless little ones who are ripped to pieces and sold to buy Lamborghinis?
@SenatorReid Mr reed 95 percent of this tweets are prolife. Wake up my friend
@SenatorReid consider the @demsforlife plan to reallocate PP funding to community health centers. Same funding for women! #PPSellsBabyParts
@SenatorReid you have lost any support for abortion now,ultrasound shows the human lives you are killing,SPCA has stricter rules for animals
@SenatorReid how can u support planparenthood
@SenatorReid you use to be be prolife what happened
@SenatorReid - so u like seeing babies body parts being sold to highest bidder...now we know the real harry
@SenatorReid You sold out a long time ago......
@SenatorReid Harry, u r the abortion that got away! You'd sell u r kids 2 PPH for votes. What a sorry, morally broken man you are Sen. Reid!
@SenatorReid Since when is murdering babies & parting out their organs 2 the highest bidder a woman's health issue? Macabre house of horrors
@Leannbe well said
@stewartarogers TY
@Leannbe sure thing
@SenatorReid Please explain how defunding a racist organization like @PPact is an attack on women's health? And they sell baby body parts.
@SenatorReid Why don't you just get off Twitter? The hatred for You is undeniable and fantastic at the same time. Thank you, fellow Patriots
@SenatorReid wrong
@SenatorReid take the $500,000,000/year and fund community health care clinics that offer health care for women #DefundPlannedParenthood
@SenatorReid  So Harry you're saying planned parenthood Should be allowed to sell dead baby parts?? That's really sick Harry. You need help
@SenatorReid You remain pathetic liar. You think human body parts are being used for protein smoothie? This has ZERO to do w/women's health
@SenatorReid No. It's an attack on selling aborted baby parts for profit. #DefundPlannedParenthood
Shame on you Harry. @SenatorReid
@SenatorReid It is the democrats who turn a blind eye to the killing of little women & the wholesaling of their organs. #DefundPP
@SenatorReid ....from the guy who learned to swim in a brothel swimming pool.
@SenatorReid crushing skulls & harvesting organs = Women's health? What happens at pearly gates when u don't have media to spin for u?
@SenatorReid Your war on children is coming to an end.
@SenatorReid Women's health has almost NOTHING to do with abortion.Comfortable playing devils advocate reaping reward?#WashingtonMachine
@SenatorReid planned parenthood deceive and we don't want our hard tax paying money to an organization that have no respect for a baby life
