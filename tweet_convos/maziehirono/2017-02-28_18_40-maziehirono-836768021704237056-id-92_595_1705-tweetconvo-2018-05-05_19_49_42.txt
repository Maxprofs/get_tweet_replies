@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You are clearly not paying attention to momentum in  market and business.  Senator you will be out
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Jesus taught in parables. It worked for me
you can't really have thought it would be any different tonight.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump she is an idiot.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump same ol' campaign speech... when is he going to actually do something or put forth an actual plan?
he has no plan
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump most of which are incomprehensible or imaginable.
@PiperPerabo @realDonaldTrump then you not listening
Yaaaaaaaas girl.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Why don't you try working with him instead dividing  America. We need to work together try helping
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Cliches? Really? Not sure what planet you live on. Very sad to here from an elected lawmaker.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Your sniveling dissent is cliche.
Mazie, YOU ARE A JOKE! I'm ashamed that you misrepresent Hawaii. You truly are a JOKE!
No kidding. What a bunch of platitudes and unfulfillable promises. Waiting for a unicorn stage left.
you're clearly not listening, senator.
"you're clearly not listening" Who could listen to that shit. I heard coal &/eliminating Protections- click @RealGacinski @maziehirono @TPM
after 8 years of fluff and empty promises, you're just not used to a meaningful SOTU address. You'll get used to it.
Thank you President Trump.  Don't listen to the haters they will soon fade to footnotes. Make America great!
Why is he 2B  congratulated 4 reading what was prepared 4 him & acting less crazy 4  once? Actions not words.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump as opposed to 8 years of Obama cliche'ing us into mediocre?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump that's all you wanted to hear. The rest you simply ignored
Seriously? Such a trite comment from you! If you're not working with him, you're not working for America!!!
Talk is cheap. He can't deliver on many of the things he's promised. Lower taxes, more spending???
finally a politician that makes sense n all dems  do is name call. Pls serve the people n not b the problem!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump cliches?? Hes making it happen honey. Do your peoplr a favor..get on board
Soundbites, no substance.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump 
Maybe you should take the beans out of your ears.
? Obama was nothing but pretty speeches. Drove country into ground,created divide, attacked our police. Weak
Sad elected officials can't see @POTUS vision & goals r where we voted to go
...just like the previous 8years

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Stop with your obstruction support of our military and law enforcement are not cliches
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump oh no,  another SNOWFLAKE HACK that wasn't listening to Mr. President Donald J.  Trump,  pay attn.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump u r right. So put his words I to actions. U have done nothing for 8yrs. All talk by u.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Clearly a speech written by someone else, someone literate and familiar with multisyllabic words!
@SenSchumer Can't govern when you're pouting. Poor babies! Think that helps your cause? Seriously?  #DemsRDone
@PiperPerabo @realDonaldTrump that is all he's ever going to do it's your job to turn up the heat and motivate people
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump haven't heard anything from you #MAGA
Now I see why things don't get done on the Left,,, You don't pay attention .. Just sit and whine on Twitter..
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuck, you're awake?
I had a stalker who sent me clich√©s on six pages of butterfly stationary once!  #LiarInChief
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Isn't that why Obama & Dems failed? Veiled Socialism is not America!
it will be far more than cliches mazie you can count on that
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BOB CREAMER GO BACK TO JAIL HOW ABOUT YOU
Mazie, you prefer all the lies of the left? That's why your party is collapsing on it's own dead weight.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump wake up and listen.
.@maziehirono @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump In fact judging by poverty in Hawaii Mazie it's clear ALL YOU DEAL In is cliches!
#Jointsession
You better get past your hate, because you work for the people and we have spoken. #MAGA or get out or voted out
That's a completely empty statement. You can't govern by those either.
@SenSchumer then you haven't been listening. @realDonaldTrump
that's every. single. speech. always a cliche.
Sitting, doing nothing, is typical of the last forty years for democrats,,
JOKEOTUS
All I hear is an old man lying about everything coming out of his mouth... I will never trust him
--Yet it's ALREADY far more than Obama ever did HMMMM!--- #Jointsession
@SenSchumer @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump YOU TWEET MORE THAN TRUMP.
Agreed. He never explains how he will accomplish his cliches. As prez, it's time he did.
He is doing. Too busy doing to explain the obvious to ignorant pseudo intellectuals
You definitely cannot govern in clinches, which is what I've got him in
hand on girl.  It only gets better from here
How come your net worth is 154% higher than the average senator? #draintheswamp
How about giving him his cabinet and a chance hon?
What station are you tuned into!?  He's done MORE in 1 month than Nation dividers like you!
we survived 8 years of Obama and company's cliches, i think we can handle this.
#fakeprez #kitkatprez
Because you just refuse to listen....
because there is no there there. He's demented.
Get ready to get your ass to work sweetheart.
Is this the pot calling the kettle black? The difference is he will be the difference.
Hater.
Better than no leadership at all as was the previous administration
You are so right.
what at least he is doing something for Americans  you need to be replaced
preach girl 
Trump is all hot air and lies so far.
with all due respect senator, if you are in the capitol, get off your phone while you're on the job.
Amen!!!
