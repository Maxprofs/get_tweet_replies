Terrible what happened. Thanks to the police and the emergency response teams but it’s a bandaid approach. Need to discuss gun laws.

Listen to words, not dialect
Fred Hampton in Court pointing out that the DA was working against him, this was before the FBI assassinated him
The FBI claiming they won't ever do things like this again
After Assassinating Fred Hampton, the FBI coveted it up and it took 20 years on court to reveal their lies
