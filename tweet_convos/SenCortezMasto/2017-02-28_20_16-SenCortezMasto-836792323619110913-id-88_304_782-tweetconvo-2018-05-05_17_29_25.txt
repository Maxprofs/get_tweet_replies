Russia Investigation--keep the pressure on them #Trumprussia #Russiagate #TaxReturns
@camtastickk #investigateRussia #StopTrump
@SenateDems jealous again!
Please continue to fight! There is NO common ground with this administration.  Demand a real investigation into Russian ties
He does what he says he'll do. 40 days of getting things done.
Zero specifics. General wish list w no way to pay except by exploding the national debt
heard nothing #sad #votesen out next time #makeapoint
#SSDD His normal gewgaw! Once a con, Always a con. May fool some ppl, Just not MOST ppl.
 *Keep up the good work Senator!
time for your divisive rhetoric to end and get to work supporting this president!
Your job is not to be a critic it is to represent your constituents and find common ground to get the people's business done
That's not what I'm hearing.  :)
You must've missed the address, then. Out vandalizing a mosque? Or was there a  Klan meeting tonight?
You should know the nationality/religion of the person you r trying to insult before sticking your foot in your mouth moron.
@SenateDems please dtop...try representing Americans instead of illegals and business interests...for a change.
  Not standing or clapping for #USNavySeal Widow His sacrifice broke AMERICA'S HEART 
@SenateDems You all took to Twitter & the press to disrespect our @POTUS. We love our @POTUS & @VP. ExDem here FYI
Really??? He's the Best President Ever! More than 62M Americans voted for him!
And 65 million voted differently. But math can be hard.
hehe still the president anyway
What WOULD make any of you happy?

@SenateDems 
The optimism in our stock market is proof that President Trumps address was well received.
he and his henchmen r the greatest threat to democracy and America.
So if you have better insights, try using them instead of sitting on your hands for our $187,000 paycheck!!!!
what have you done for us lately other than obstruct? I really would like to know.
But I did prefer whoever that was in the Trump suit to the 2+ years of name calling and media blasting.
#TrumpGrandioseDelusions
he double talks and lies. healthcare access isn't healthcare.
Thank you.  I completely agree with you.  Lots of grand words that meant nothing and conflict with what he is doing.
@SenateDems It was John Baron selling kool-aid and Americans bought it!
@SenateDems There's a lot of that going around. In the mirror.

You say that as a Dem/liberal. Great speech. Even media says so #ElectionisOver #ClintonLost #Trump=POTUS
except for those who sat all others proud of our truly American @POTUS who continues to reach out to unify #USA 
#Nevada
I don't think you really believe this rubbish. You know he means what he says. Truth can't be denied.
I'm afraid your party (democrat) is over.. you are wrong and will be voted out...losers...
again a $ hungry politician mad at REAL change cause of @POTUS
@SenateDems lol you will be voted out for doing nothing
@SenateDems he did kinda talk about the worlds issues by saying he's the president of the US. Not the world.
thank you & please continue to investigate Russia issue
Same as this tweet is from you.
@SenateDems WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE COUNTRY?? Need more than a list of complaints.
@SenateDems you lie.  Trump is our hero who saves us from communists
@SenateDems it was a great speech. Dems need new leadership. It's like watching the walking dead.
@SenateDems @POTUS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROUGHT HOPE BACK TO AMERICA AGAIN!
@SenateDems trump is our hero to save us from communists
wait and watch
Anyone criticizing THAT speech, shows themselves to be nothing but a political hack, and loses all credibility.
@SenateDems I wanna say...that everybody was so torn up that nut job Maxine waters didn't bless us with her attendance.
@SenateDems we shall see, my friend.
@SenateDems Thank you, Senator! Please continue to push for a full investigation of Trump Admin ties to Russia.
cause that will get you a job libtard....
@SenateDems YOU'RE DEAF!
@SenateDems Replace Trump with Obama and you hit the nail on the head. Dems are done!
I thought he was pretty clear about the direction, and that is down.
Clinton, Obama, Soros puppet
@SenateDems not a surprise, give up hope he will change and investigate #Trumprussia #russiasgate now. 45 most corrupt
And your proof????? Ya, what I thought.
@SenateDems RUSSIA! Jesus people!
The Russia story was just used as a distraction away from Hillary. It didn't work.
No no no that's Obama you're talking about. He's not President anymore.
@SenateDems You just keep on telling yourself that.
@SenateDems did you listen
A speech that was so good even a Grand Wizard of the KKK approved.
your are truly delusional,your suffering from having your butts kicked in the white House,Senate,and House
are you giving up your salary like the people in hos cabinet and the president
if you would open your eyes and ears then youll be able to see and hear what the rest of us do.
Wrong. It was truth and vision. Something we haven't seen in the White House for a very long time.
Are you on drugs? You might want to review the tape because that assessment couldn't be further from the truth.
Maybee this senator needs a hearing aid.
Since 1/20/2017, what have you DONE to help Trump ?
Have you helped seat his Cabinet nominees ?
Spoke out against crime ?
Well First Latina Senator what have you done that is constructive to help the nation? Do something even if it is wrong.
if only he would create jobs..oh wait.  If only he'd talk to other...oh wait.  Maybe u call him, talk..it's u, not him
it was also lacking in any real way to pay for any of his plans.
focus on #Trumprussia Ties & FILIBUSTER GORSUCH. Filibuster all legislation.
nothing deliverable..nothing specific...nothing new
I know right all the other politicians are fresh and always do what they say right?
Right
Get real brother.
