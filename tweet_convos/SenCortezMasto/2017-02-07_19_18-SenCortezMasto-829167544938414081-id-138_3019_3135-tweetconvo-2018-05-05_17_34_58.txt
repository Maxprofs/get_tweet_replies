@SenateDems @SenWarren Why don't and Dems get real jobs, or can u work? Ur awful at senators.
d
How about NOT well informed and deplorable
I would like to see a bipartisan effort for every female Sen to stand up and read this. Heck, include the House.
#noSCOTUSforChump
I'd like to see the proof that shows that Sessions has been harassing people,  then I'll conced,
until then,  it's just hearsay
@SenateDems @SenWarren READ THE LETTER - don't let @SenateGOP off the hook - make them object over and over again.
100%!!!
@PoliticalGaffe @SenWarren her letter is grandstanding and gives no evidence
Your frigging boy Trump is nothing more then a grandstanding hot dog. lOL!
" My boy"? I didn't vote for him. Voted against him, TWICE
thank you for supporting this.
Bravo!  #StopTheGOKKKParty #VoteDemocrat2018
the letter is a falsehood and is proven untrue......it is also public record. SMH.
Telling: responses came as attacks against Warren's character; bids to imbue factual testimony w malignant tints.
the letter would had been fine to pass out but rule 19 was broken when she spoke on it. have to play by the rules
Thank you for sharing and supporting Warren in this effort. This is letter is evidence. The evoked rule was wrong
#shepersist
I don't want to doubt this, but isn't the letter dated from 1986?
Isn't this letter addressed to an avowed racist and known klansman? Wasn't he a Democrat?
Spread it like wild fire!!!! NO TO SESSIONS
you missed the point a...hole! He did her a favor!
Thanks for standing up for the new Moral party. Go DEMS 2018. GOP falling apart at the seams! Devos is an idiot
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
Shameful. How will we retaliate?
yea! Rules don't apply when it's democrats breaking them! Ask dirty Harry reid! And pocahontas warren
let's retweet the letter. Here it is!
ALL Democratic Sens should stand up & read Coretta Scott King's letter today.
Dean Heller heard from me this morning. A disgusting vote! Thanks, Senators Cortez Masto & Warren!
The truth about Senator Sessions is horrible and anti american, millions are now watching and mobilizing
Thank you @SenCortezMasto @SenWarren #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems @SenWarren I guess only white conservatives are allowed to speak in the senate now; McConnel is such a hypocrite
@blumspew @SenWarren Every single Senator should stand up and read that letter today. Persist.

Last week, #SallyYates was silenced.
This week, #ElizabethWarren

#LetLizSpeak #CorettaScottKing …
@UniteBlue @SenWarren Always darkest before the dawn...ONWARD!
we get it ..rules mean nothing to you all
Dear @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @ReinceGOP @jeffsessions @GOP @SenCortezMasto @SenWarren #CorettaScottKing letter. Enjoy.
@AspireVM @SenWarren Such BS, you know damn well it was about fauxahontas & not Mrs. King's letter
Can you get any GOP Senators to ABSTAIN from Sessions vote? (then they don't have to vote No, just abstain)
I love Warren and despise the thought of AG Sessions, but this outrage push is so contrived :/.
@SenateDems @SenWarren Thx for sharing this letter. Unbelievable what happened to Sen. Warren on the Senate floor tonight.
@SenateDems @SenWarren Senator Warren needs to learn to stop insulting people.
@jhaletweets @SenWarren how do I know that isn't fake?
relax, I'm joking.
let her speak!!!
Keep speaking up. I am proud that you represent my State.
@SenateDems @SenWarren  Read the letter. Let her speak!
READ THE LETTER!!!
WOW!!!! Sen. Session is a racist and a crook just like his Pres.
You are a Racist!
indeed @SenJeffSessions was unqualified then, and even more unqualified now. #LetLizSpeak
I stand with both of you!
RESIST
@Gulomf @SenWarren #letlizspeak
We know about the letter, but is there anything in it except scurrilous accusations?
GOPs & @SenateMajLdr love their ignorant constituent base and want to make all of America ignorant constituents
I wish I could get close enough to Mitch to touch my brown skin to his and lick his face. I would be arrested
but it would be worth it. His friends would think of him as a nugget lover... Come here Mitch
That was a letter which was an opinion by Coretta. It contains no proof of any wrong doing.
Anyone can obtain a letter from anyone alleging all kinds of things. That doesn't make it true.
FACTS ARE FACTS. Thank you for this. #LetLizSpeak
Mitch M is a weasel that's been waiting on Trumps arrival. All of Trumps appointments will make it through.
thank you both.
: Your running on old fumes in a dead gas tank lady; that letter is dated 1986 for heaven sake, get a life!
Sen Merkley just read the letter. GOP silenced a habitual rule breaker, not the letter. A correction is in order
that is the introduction.https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259988-Scott-King-1986-Letter-and-Testimony-Signed.html#document/p1 …  That is the letter. Its 10 pages long
I hope every dem reads this letter and gets a rule 19 w/ warren.  Total power trip
@co_rapunzel4 @SenWarren The shameful @GOP restricting freedom of speech, all of them are despicable morally corrupt scum!!!
I am out raged that not only was E. Warren silenced but C. King.  All women.
@antonio4ca @SenWarren What is up with this @LAPDChiefBeck @LAPDHQ @lacountysheriff  @KFIAM640
people do change in 25 years. Or are you so narrow minded you've never changed ANYTHING?Just curious.
Fascism is taking over Democracy, we need to #Resist Keep the letter circulating.  #LetLizSpeak

GOP is shutting down opposing voices elsewhere too. #LetLizSpeak @CommBovo http://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513957948/miami-dade-officials-attempt-to-block-debate-over-immigration-orders … https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/829154781063151616 …
#mcconnellisanazi. Shame, Mitch. Shame.

@ThisIsBuck @SenWarren Also, Rachel Maddow read a good part of it on her show tonight. Inspiring!
Let it be known from now forward.
What happen to this little thing called the first Ammendment? Or does it not apply to the Senate?
We as women will not be silenced any longer and told to sit down by any man. We Nevada Women Stand With You
@SenateDems @SenWarren I feel like I am living a nightmare.
that's just bc both R  just blooming idiots! No other reason! Neither 1 could ever have anything important to say
Stop trying to foment anarchism by trying to sully Coretta Scott King into your anti-American lies.
Ooh this is good. What part is Anti-American?
