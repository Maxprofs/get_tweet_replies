Attorney General Sessions is recusing himself from any probe related to 2016 presidential campaign http://wapo.st/2my5k1r 
#Sessionssucks we know, but we won't forget your vote for Slimey Wilbur Ross either...don't be a sell out
Stop at nothing less than resignation
@SenateDems Perjury is a crime.
yes perjury is a crime.  He lied about a very important element in his testimony. Disqualified!
this is payback for those other two losers we had Lynch and Holder. How about their honesty and integrity?
Your one to talk.
if Sessions does NOT resign IMMEDIATELY or Democrats are unable to get him removed and tried for perjury then i will be sick
this Cabinet is not remotely acceptable.  EVERY post is occupied by THE most ill-equipped and evil person possible.
what did you say about the meeting on the tarmac? Or were you silent about #LorettaLynch?
First Latina Senator. Where is your proof?
Yeah, sure. Bring back Holder or Tarmac Lynch.
#JeffSessions should be convicted of perjury. #JeffSessionsMustGo
Dems are causing all the strife and turmoil. Sessions must NOT resign! Dems cannot accept the will of the people - so sad!
Sessions answered the question that was presented by Sen. Franken, and did not hide anything.
he's a liar. If we lied under oath, we'd be in jail! #FireSessions 
Yes. Please demand full investigation of entire administration & ties to Russia. Let's not forget Putin is murderer & tyrant
Thank you. Today we know he also lied about meeting with the ambassador a senator when in fact he used campaign funds.
To anyone thanking her you may want to know she voted yes for Rick Perry for energy secretary. WTF why the vote with REPUBLICANS NO TO trump
recusing himself is not enough. Dance around it all anyone likes, but he out and out lied and  has no credibility
AG Sessions is FAR more Trustworthy than the previous AG Lynch
it's bad enough to have  had to awaken to Trump being POTUS for 2  nightmarish months & witnessing the most corrupt cabinet
@SenateDems @washingtonpost listen to the newbie on the block voted in by illegal immigrants
@SenateDems 2018 is coming back lash you lost get over it 2018 you out of work
Just a second ago he was your esteemed colleague, now he's "evil," WE ARE NOT LEMMINGS!!! YOU ARE!!!#MAGA
Who would you suggest? Someone like Lyin' Loretta? She should be hung in the public square like the rest of you!
@SenateDems doj has been totally corrupt. It will stop
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS IMPORTANT TRUSTING YOU DEM SEN TO NOT VOTE FOR AN UNQUALIFIED FOOL LIKE RICK PERRY. EXPLAIN YOUR VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
jumping right in there aren't you Harry Jr
@SenateDems Si many if us agree! A long road to getting him to resugn though
@SenateDems yes, perjury is a crime, so put Holder, Lynch And Hillary in jail
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @RepSenators @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats Session must be let go or yr fired !
@KatCeccotti Sally Yates should be asked to be a special investigator/prosecutor on #russiagate   She puts constitution 1st
thank you senator!
keep crying. Sessions isn't going anywhere.
wrong again Senator
We will accept your #Resignation anytime now TY...When is the election to take you downI'm ready to give my donation!!!
@SenateDems  well Senator McCaskill's flat out Lies are enough! Where are you telling her to RESIGN! Why don't you also!
@SenateDems @washingtonpost he must go
@SenateDems He cannot be trusted period, end of story.
Sessions can be trusted. It's you Democrats twisting stories out of context who can't be trusted. #fail
I thought ethics, morals, and accepting of science-based facts was just an option for this administration? /s
@SenateDems Lynch took the 5th
@DaShanneStokes @washingtonpost I object to attaching dignity to removal. Lying under oath got Clinton impeached.
@SenateDems resign only option
@SenateDems Tough patooties loser...
@SenateDems FAKE NEWS. YOU JUST DREDGE UP ANYTHING. ITS NOT GOING TO WORK!
"recusal is not enough" because YOU say so ?!? "cannot be trusted" because YOU say so ?!? You Fanatical Libs are outrageous!
Holder held a presser to explain exactly what his role was in Fast and Furious and Lynch distanced herself from email probe
@SenateDems what can we the people do to make this happen asap?
especially if this investigation should need to look further than the election. That's all he's recusing himself from.
@SenateDems This is exactly why voters have abandoned your party. Your attempts to undermine this President are maddening.
@SenateDems you should resign
@SenateDems I watched the hearing & Sessions LIED. He must RESIGN
@SenateDems in full context, Franken's question was answered truthfully. QUIT manufacturing stories and feigned outrage.
IlAnd we need an independent investigation of Russian ties
@SenateDems @CharlesMBlow next time Congress, listen to Coretta Scott King!!!
@JohnLeguizamo @ananavarro @wiselatinaslink A full investigation, disbarred & even jail. He was the AG, lie under OATH!!!!
@SenateDems u mean like @AGLynch on bills plane honesty!
@SenateDems This's utter nonsense. We in the public have heard the FULL question in context & his answer. You're detestable.
@SenateDems No one is above the law!
except the Clintons
@SenateDems Not good enough !!!! I am sure there is funny business with Russia after Jan 20th and Sessions knows it !!!
@_Unionistparty 

AMARICAAAAAAAAA...WAKE UP !!!
AMERICAAAAAAAAA...WAKE UUUUUUP !
@MSignorile @washingtonpost Liberal Wet dreams
Agreed! This entire administration is corrupt, tainted and arguably treasonous. #newelection
@SenateDems @washingtonpost recusal is not enough, we need AT LEAST an independent prosecutor for Russian probe
@SenateDems #FireSessions or resignation he needs to be removed
@MSignorile I agree he should be arrested and charged with treason
NC Senator @joycekrawiec blocked me today when I asked her to call for his resignation.
No worries. I just hit her up for you 
one of your constituents thanks you!Our other Senator seems to be mia
how come when you break immigration law you don't resign?  At least Sessions is only accused, we know you break the law
i bite my nails sometimes
@MSignorile @washingtonpost Wet dreams!
YES
Exactly. Thank you.
and people can trust you? Take your own advise
Claire McCaskill is calling you.
thank you for fighting for the people of NV unlike @SenDeanHeller who just runs and hides
@MSignorile Hillary lied to Congress a lot more. Shut the duck up snowflake liberals
and ya'll sure demanded answers, launched investigations, and spent millions. Lock him up!
If you haven't done anything wrong, Senator, you shouldn't fear being investigated.
thank you for fighting for us!
senator, you rock. glad i made some calls for you last election!
Thank you, sincerely, from one of your constituents!!
