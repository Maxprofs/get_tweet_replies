Like other GOP Presidents before him, Trump is on splurging path and bankrupt the exchequer
Trump is a perpetual business bankrupt and he may bankrupt American economy
All the GOP Presidents left office with American economy in ruins, Trump is next in line
@SenSchumer @CNBC Clear border essential. Muddled lines is the worst problem with government. Following existing rules is 
A wall is an expensive ineffective way of controlling our borders.  There has to be a better way.
@SenSchumer @CNBC i agree Donald trump is a true asshole!!!!
Cost of the wall estimated by Trump to be 8 Billion dollars!  Realistic estimates 25 Billion!
@SenSchumer @CNBC this is what Mexico can cost us
@SenSchumer
But...how much will the roof cost?
And it won't work. Biggest waste of money ever. And Flint still doesn't have drinking water.
either with trade deals or withholding aid
CA high speed rail is estimated @ nearly 70 billion. A 2000 mile high security wall will cost less?  Nonsense.
@SenSchumer @CNBC Actually it would employ many people and provide a clear tangible border. Something we need.
Right. And coming from a man who didn't pay taxes and bragged about it. I don't think so.
Luckily he and his friends don't pay taxes
Let's spend that money on our vets! 1000s of times a better value!
@SenSchumer @CNBC This is a despicable move on Donald Trump's part, he's destroying our country and destroying our economy.
@SenSchumer Can citizens oppose paying for the  wall?
@SenSchumer @CNBC cheaper than letting thousands cross and living here for free
build a new everglades along the border fill with crocs be cheaper than wall
@SenSchumer @CNBC This money would be better used to feed Americans.
And make them safe, worth paying for!
worth every penny.
we sure could use that 10B dollars for your infrastructure plan!
DUH......one word.......tunnels
thank you for standing up against this *massive* waste of hardworking American's tax money.
@SenSchumer OBAMA'S PENTAGON WASTED $125 BILLION. HILLARY LOST $6 BILLION WHILE SEC OF STATE. #Borderwall IS HAPPENING!!!
While illegals cost working American families hundreds of billions of dollars.
Please do something about all these crazy exec orders!!
@SenSchumer @CNBC I don't want to be fenced in with him. Ever.
@SenSchumer @CNBC and decimate ACA, Social Security, VA and women. Please please muzzle him.
Money for this wall comes from? Borrow from Social Security and no pay back again? We put that money in!!!
@SenSchumer @CNBC Trump is der Fuhrer in chief.
@SenSchumer @CNBC  and to build his wall, will be an excuse to rob all of us of our healthcare and social security WRONG!
Halted Obamas administration sending 221 million dollars Palestine. That could help pay now!
wow
@SenSchumer @CNBC #ImpeachTrump NOW!
@POTUS and it's a stupid idea.
I am a Las Vegas Dem & proudly voted for you. Please, please help us!  We protested at Hellers yesterday. Be strong & LOUD
@SenSchumer @CNBC The border will cost us our healthcare, civil rights, environment, everything Republicans are diverting.
@SenSchumer @CNBC he's generous w/others taxes!  He should prove he pays taxes before spending mine. Illegitimate American!
@SenSchumer @CNBC I doubt undocumented wars will file this year Ask IRS about non conforming SSN's
@SenSchumer @CNBC People send remittances to nations all over the world Sure to be constitutional issue
@SenSchumer @CNBC @POTUS @ananavarro @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake They can put me in jail.  I'M NOT PAYING FOR THE DAMN WALL!
@SenSchumer @CNBC I want Dems to fight ALL. 8 yrs GOP blocked ALL out of dislike of pres -did not put Americans first
@SenSchumer @CNBC defund healthcare for Americans citizens and use the funds to build a wall. Congressional priorities. SMH
@SenSchumer @CNBC I want the truth not LIESno gag orders, no political staff oversight of EPA, no double standard on ethics
@SenSchumer @CNBC I prefer healthcare, social security, Medicare, Medicaid, job opportunities for ALL, lower drug prices,
@SenSchumer Then why was it put into law in 2006; the building of a wall/fence?
@SenSchumer @CNBC that wall would not have kept Russia from hacking the election or planes flying into bldgs on 9/11
Trump is UNSTABLE, @SenCortezMasto. Dems have to grow a backbone! Govt. by Personality Disorder is NOT A PLAN. Fight him & SAVE the U.S.!
he has no clue and trying to do it no matter who it effects so he can say he did it
@SenSchumer @CNBC it will keep us safe from criminals/drugs/it's happening
It cost us billons now, and we're not getting anywhere.
Billions for defense, but not one $ for stupidity
@SenSchumer @CNBC we have billions in confiscated Mexican drug $....problem solved!
@SenSchumer @CNBC not really if he stiffs the contractors as he's done more than a few times
I elected you. You voted for duncecap Ben Carson? Not happy. @SenSchumer @CNBC
@SenSchumer @CNBC He doesn't care. Been spending someone elses money all his life. Why doesn't he pay for it. Not as rich???
@SenSchumer @CNBC He's an idiot. Senators in his own party have said it's not effective. Only idiots ask for a wall.
I can't afford this. I need to save as much as I can to get my kids through college.
@SenSchumer @CNBC and jobs it wont build it self
..idea hire from the unemployment line that Americans are on that helps usa
At least I am paying for something that will help protect our country!!!!
Isn't Mexico paying for it. 
@SenSchumer @CNBC if @realDonaldTrump is so rich, he should pay for his own wall. #imnotpaying #NoWall
A tax on remittances will pay for it, don't worry.
