.@SenCortezMasto In reply to @LindseyGrahamSC, @SenatorSessions said he's "open" to fed ban on NV's #poker websites!
.@SenCortezMasto How about Sessions' hypocrisy in opposing some bills, claiming states' rights, while open to banning states' online #poker?
@senSessions says he will uphold the law, 
problem is that he doesn't accept the facts to which the law applies!

Beware!
please oppose sessions. protect NVs citizens and all Americans & oppose all AGs who attempt a federal ban on ipoker. freedom
Please support online poker
Please oppose efforts to strip Nevada of its #TenthAmendment right to authorize online poker.
NV #poker is the business of NV. Will you write in opposition to efforts to ban iPoker, as AZ's AG did? cc @SenatorSessions
US/state  based Internet poker has been proven to be safe for US consumers. Please reject any type of ban. #NoPokerBan
Please oppose Sen Session's and Graham's attempts to federally ban online poker. Let the states decide.
please oppose all efforts to ban state run online poker sites, players need consumer protections and revenues are a bonus.
Please oppose efforts of a federal ban of online poker.  Regulation is the sensible answer.
Agree!
Support Regulated Online Poker. Jeff Session's Justice Dept should NOT recycle The Wire Act to ban Regulated Online Poker.
Please support the licensing and regulation of online poker in America.

Cortez Mastro 2020!!! What a great president she would be!
Maybe for Venezuela. Not for people that already have freedom.
He's also a crony capitalist. He supports legislation written to ban competition for Sheldon Adelson. Oppose RAWA.
Thank you Senator Cortez Masto for caring about your constituents and all ppl who want a fair and impartial AG.
why do you say that?! #mean
Thanks for your opinion.  Now beat it.
Please support regulated online poker in America.
He'd have made an excellent AG for Jefferson Davis.

@onlxn Why was such a controversial figure as Sessions nominated? Perhaps to distract from Tillerson & financial windfalls.
I’m troubled by Sen. Sessions history of using controversial and racially insensitive rhetoric. He is not fit to serve as our next AG.
