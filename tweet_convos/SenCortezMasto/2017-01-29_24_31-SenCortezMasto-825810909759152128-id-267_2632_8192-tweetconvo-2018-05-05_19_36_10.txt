Kamala focus on the issues in California will ya? We don't need you standing in the streets protesting. We need u working.
Immigration is a big issue in California!
it sure is. Illegals cost taxpayers $25 Billion per year in CA. We are $400 billion in debt. Huge issue.
nice try Ann. nice try.
let's look at it all more closely. this is great. thanks.
the #'s don't lie. $25 billion per year to support illegal immigration. From our paychecks.
where are your pussy hats?
Keep up the pressure, Senator Harris. You are new to the Senate; but, I am proud to call you my Senator. Stay strong!
Beware America, Kamamalala's ILLEGAL ALIENS are going to do to America what they JUST did to Quebec City! BEWARE AMERICA!!!!!!
wish she was our president or the VP. Country in distress.
You will not stand for vetting to make all Americans safe? You do not stand for safety for Americans? Can you explain why not?
Fight on the floor of the #Senate - no cooperation! #ResistTrump
Wow!  If only she had spoken up for California homeowners and prosecuted Steve Mnuchin & 1west bank.
Kamala Harris is AWESOME!
So glad to have great people from both coasts fighting for whats right! #PuttingTheLeftinLeftCoast #resist
Ladies and gentlemen, this broad is sheer appetite. If you stand before her and a live TV camera, your life is in danger.
"This broad" is a US senator. Misogynist much?
Infer much?
there is no antimuslim rhetoric
my daughter just asked to re-watch "the video of the lady who said we will stand up for our Muslim brothers and sisters" TY
more morons
@ValerieJarrett just an opportunity for the junior senator to babble.
@carolynlochhead Fighting isn't enough. Winning is the only acceptable goal.
I am so proud of you! Thank you for making Californian's proud! We could ask for no better representative. <3 <3 <3 #StayWoke

Thank you for your support!
@JenniferGrey Oh, Jennifer. Go oppose Muslims in Yemen, SA, Qatar, etc. See how far you get.
lets just open borders and take a chance meanwhile letting refugees & terrorist in so we can arm, house and feed them. Wake up
so you won't fight for Americans? Good to know.
massive respect fir Americans 
You are a shining example of what makes America exceptional! #KamalaHarrisForPresident2020
I agree!!!!
@reesetheone1 keep it up, we Dems need a new generation of leaders
@benshapiro Good paraphrase of Churchill, any idea of how you plan to accomplish this?
All you Obama moles are packing up in 2018, you can bet on that.
How about Sanders/Harris 2020?!
Proud of Sen Cortez Masto.
Stop chanting and fight. He doesn't hear you, make them fear you.
I pray you are not a victim soon, because she won't be there. Let govt do its work now. @KamalaHarris
exactly!
.@KamalaHarris Girl...I gave you a hard time yesterday. You showed UP today. Very proud you represent me and my community #NoBanNoWall
I gave her a hard time too.  I thank her for standing up and speaking out.  Now let's stop all Trump nominees.
but will you fight against islamic repression of women and gays?
she'll tell you what she needs to get your vote
Not
I am more concerned about Radical Islamic Terror than rhetoric but that is just me...
please stop him from destroying the dreams of many immigrants who love this country more than Trump and his supporters.
You are my CA representative. Do your job and represent me. Start the Impeachment of Trump!
Yes!  THAT is the woman I voted for.
so proud that you are my senator!
You're going to make America great again, Kamala. I know it. 2020!
@ValerieJarrett Proud you're my senator!
Thank you, Senator Harris! 
it's NOT anti muslim. Fucking lunatics, liars and ambulance chasers.
Voting for you was honestly the best decision I made in all of 2016. #ProudCalifornian
..I feel so bad for the poor sap who has to come home to this bitch ! .. time for a beer NFL a little of this a little of that
thank you!!!!!
Loving you right now.  Keep that shit up!!! #NoBanNoWall #notmypresident
Islam is not a race...Mexico is not a race....your anti-racism virtue signaling is getting a little old.
@smrtgrls Kamala you keep repeating we will fight, be specific. 
Get  GOP senators to stand against reckless executive orders.
Says the dumb Democrat race trainer.
Muslim is not race.
Immigrant is not a race.
Muslim is not race.
Immigrant is not a race.
Will you run for POTUS from the independent country of The Islamic State of California?
PLEASE run for president
@SenFeinstein this is what we Californians expect from our Senator. Say no to #PresidentSnowflake Cabinet Keep it Up! @KamalaHarris
@TxGoingBlue please fight for our homeless families and veterans too
Obama did the same thing in 2011, genius. Where was the outrage? Where's the outrage when Obama screwed over Israel? Hypocrite
I say throw them n the middle of about 100 Muslim men n watch their feelings change. They would be screaming 4 conservatives
the refugee ban isn't racism you big dummy
great video! The angle! Lighting! WOW!
Her husband probably never listens to her
@SenCortezMasto Why must you make everything about race.
You could fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism, the horrible care Vets get at VA or undrinkable water in Flint. Too hard? Talk is cheap!
<< Fraud........
We will fight anyone who tries to come to #America and attempts to cause harm!
#AmericaFirst

You rock, Madame Senator.
LOL...Obama has been bombing Muslim countries and no protest...typical phoney outrage
Thank you, Senator. I'm proud you had my vote. #NoBanNoWall #resist
yes!!!!
You're amazing & such a bright light in all this darkness. So proud to have voted for you & so grateful you're fighting for us
@MAHAMOSA people want to live in #PeaceAndLove #2017 #protest #resist
fantasyland
keep fighting! Your constituents support you.
@MAHAMOSA  Clinton and Obama did it too.  Quit the drama Dems! Stop the bad media.

@yasarokur Ne saçma işler
@MAHAMOSA.If Obama had not bombed there countries into the dirt we would not have to be dealing with mass immigration.Outrage?
@ValerieJarrett thank you, Kamala 
thanku
is the embodiment of democratic leadership (note: not capitalized)
Senator Harris you have my attention and support for 2020!
Thank you for standing up for us. #USbackinUSA
@Li2red88 Thank you Sen Harris. 
Kamala is one of the new faces of democracy in the USA!
Thank you for standing with us for justice 
Thank you for your leadership. Now block those nominees!!! #Resist
please run for president 
Screening possible terrorist threats isn't racism.
an islamist agitator
don't back down. #Resistance
Nice rant. Maybe you can be the DNC Chairperson. Anyone can't rant. Where's the action to keep Americans safe? Let's see some real action.
@JenniferGrey will you fight for us?   Terrorists sneaking in with refugees.   Should we not protect Americans?   All of them.
thank you for standing up for our values!
@JJFan18 Kamala's on the front lines. she's doing this. she's right there in it, with the people. 
Thank you, Senator @KamalaHarris
Thank you!
you make me proud to be a proud #californian #california #resist #resisttrump
Fight for everything but when people are killed at nightclubs,marathons,trade centers you sit back and say 
" tht's so tertible"&do nothing
President Harris??!?? hhhmmm...another Californian in the White House
@JenniferGrey bot against ban, wall, Sessions and Devos. NoBan#NoWall
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @DiamondandSilk banning terrorist countries only not a religion baby.
@JenniferGrey but why can't you fight for the unborn? #ProLife #WomensMarch
Thank you. Please also remember to fight Bannon's power grab with everything you have.
so were is her plan on immigration or protecting our borders yep that's what i thought
.@KamalaHarris Voting for you is one of the best things I did in 2016. Thank you for taking action when so many of your colleagues won't.

Keep up the fight!  Resist at every turn. We need you!
Kamala Harris is my 2020 candidate pick!
You go @KamalaHarris !!!
lol
@tinahayes22
DO IT!
thank you!

HU! You Know! Stand up!
or you could stop lying to people & stop using buzzwords to push those lies that would be super. #YouHelpNothing
Your outrage is selective. Our country has participated in covert wars since Obama took office. I can't STAND politicians!
This is great. Thank you! I have renewed faith in you.
much respect @KamalaHarris
Go Kamala. Kick some Butt!!
does this mean you're going to oppose Trump's nomines?
Islam is not a race but a political ideology that suppresses women, be careful what you defend.
can you share specific legislation you are working or legal actions you are initiating?  important to get in front of this now
No compromise w/Trump Admin. Hard ball to the end. Tired of his projection/transference psych issues...
And by fight, do you mean lead the call to impeach? Seven days too many. Take the lead future President Harris.
@wendymac fight against Bannon before we end up in a global war!
Kamala in 2020.
I have an idea - why don't you fight FOR the country you call home?  or leave.  At least have the decency to resign. #traitors
How exactly are you going to fight a despot who virtually has the entire government enabling him? HOW?
Anti-Muslim groups & hate speech needs to be curbed:
you make the GOP stronger every time you speak
@dreamjar Get it girl!
talk is great, time to legislate!
we need you to run in 2020.
man I am so proud to have voted for you.
LOL
@JimmyColema1060 Then go to the Middle East and do just that! Just notify your next of kin because you won't be coming back
fu 2
@JimmyColema1060 where were these people before Trump got into office all of a suden we're having all this Rederick bull crap
when you are given false information until you see the truth, then you react!
Thank you for speaking out and making California proud.
Thank you for taking a stand! I am proud to have you as my senator!
Thank you Senator @KamalaHarris
Glad to see #NV represented! Keep up the good work Senators #Resist
such a powerful speaker! Wish I could have been there to witness it in person.
your "ban" is "proposed,the Sioux at Standing Rock are fighting for their right to LIVE
speak on it! Yes!!! We will unite. Impeach trump!
I am down with Kamala Harris#mykkalj
Thank you, Senator. We need gov officials who are willing to take it to the streets.
Harris for dog catcher 2020!
Kamala Harris will say anything to get on TV, she's a fraud and another progressive zero.
Your silence on last week's #MarchforLife2017 speaks volumes. #forwardnotback
So proud to have you as our senator 
@jmpalmieri how? What are your objectives? Plan?
thank you for getting directly involved. Californian's are proud of you today!
@jmpalmieri you are not fighting. You are blowing wind out of your mouth.
@owillis @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @mike_pence Goodstart going2 Muslim countries& fighting radical Islamist terrorist
Don't fault R government for wanting better vetting &legal immigration
.@KamalaHarris thank you Senator Harris!
thank you, Kamala!  Thank you for standing up!  For being a leader and giving us a voice!!
Yup, that is my Senator #NoBanNoWall
pls don't forget that phone call of DJT with putin and Bannon appt at nsc!!!!
@allanbrauer Vote NO on all things trump.
You barely made it to Washington, and made a fool of yourself during CIA interviews. Go home.
then stop confirming his cabinet picks! Stand by your word!
Seems a WAR has been declared against the press, the Judiciary & the American people, by R own President! What do we do about it? Pivotal!
over reach seems like war declared by Soros and DNC because they can not handle not being in charge
More of this please. Let us see you leading.
THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING US.  For fighting the good fight.  For putting your words into action.  THANK YOU.
My President looks a lot like @KamalaHarris. @StarryMag
Yes, please! She has my support!
We hope she does consider running, she is an inspiration and an amazing advocate.
Kamala 2020.
