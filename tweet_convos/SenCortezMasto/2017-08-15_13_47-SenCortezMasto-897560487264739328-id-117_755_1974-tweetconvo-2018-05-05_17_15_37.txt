Police officers were killed in the name of Black Lives Matter and the left said nothing. Hypocrite fascists.
You're just trying to get attention by blaming the president for other people's actions. I won't be voting for you, good luck
That's ok J Troll...there are hundreds of thousands in Nevada that will vote for Senator Cortez Masteo. Feel free to move to Russia with DT.
I don't personally care who or how many people you claim will vote for @SenCortezMasto . I'm a voter in Nevada and I'm expressing myself
As am I
yet again he says blame those who started and encouraged violence which is what you should be man enough to do! but no you fail again.
Trump immediately stated that he condemned the violence in Charlottesville yet, for some reason, a very specific group can't hear that.
Yet again, you have shown you have selective hearing Catherine. Maybe focus on all the issues facing Nevadans.
The Orange Maniac has ushered in a new era of racism and Nazism.
I'm not a Trump fan but watched the conf.  He didn't stand up for Nazis.  Ur post is crap and i voted for u!
No worries Troll, there are many many thousands here in NV who actually care that our elected officials are standing up to racists and Nazis
Do you think Trump is a racist and or a Nazi?
Wrong again Senator...he spoke out about both sides!
What is wrong with you? Did u really hear what he said and implied??!!
We have a President who has as much trouble telling the difference between responsible citizens and Nazis as he has with candles and torches
Yet again, you are lying to Americans. #BothSides are to blame and @POTUS was correct. Violence in any form for any reason is unacceptable
Having King Cheeto in charge is devestating our country and crushing the souls of our citizens
LOVE our POTUS! SO GREAT TO HEAR TRUTH! So tired of grandstanding politicians who look away from violence on left to further their agenda.
So to be clear @tammlen; the 'Truth' you are agreeing with is that whites are the supreme race and America should become an Aryan Nation?
Thank you, Senator!
Where were all these race-bating liberals during the Obama Administration? As Ferguson burned he said "stay the course" with no outrage.
Impeach Trump now please
Senator - what can we do to support you and US Congressmen to oust this incompetent, dangerous president?
You are mouthing the party line Senator- the communist party line. Clearly you have not watched or read POTUS comments. Proof you are aloof!
What?!? Really?! Seriously, stop the hyperbole.
#ImpeachTrump now.Need ur leadership.As Nazi sympathizer DT can't fulfill Prez oath2 defend Const.&Democrcy
He stood up for the First Amendment and the rule of law, something that you swore an oath to do.

You obviously hate the US and should quit.
False statement!!!!! Hypocrisy of the Democrats!!!!!!
.@realDonaldTrump has failed as a member of the human race.
The R Senators need to go, together, to the WH and face him to say, resign or be impeached.

Trump just said antifa started fight on sat by "charging in swinging clubs" at racists. Video shows the  opposite 
And now what happens? He is a poor representation of america
Go ahead no one's listening the election will speak what we the people want it's not Residence and dem
- Another collaborator heard from. What a surprise.

Dr. @CornelWest says anti-fascist and anarchist protesters protected clergy from white nationalists Friday night: "They saved our lives" 
#AntiFa are true patriots standing up for injustice and other people who can't fight for themselves. Systemic state racism is the main issue
LEOs have always been guilty of racism and bigotry:
#LAriots
#WattsRiots 
were a result of a racist system declaring open war on coloureds
Even today the @POTUS is blaming #Antifa to divert attention from the true terrorists:
#DirtyCops
#AltRight
#CorruptPoliticians
We are in this together the majority of Americans aren't billionaires/millionaires 
voting for @POTUS won't make you a success or wealthy
Calling #BlackLivesMatter or #Antifa terrorist orgs is the true crime against America.Said groups are a response to murder not a cause of it
I agree with your statement and I believe that our country is close to becoming a military state for obvious reasons.
Then remove him please
And so I hope you will be among our elected leaders who start the process of removing this unfit person from office. #resist
Won't happen
Easy to not stand by your Pres. when he is not popular, but through thick or thin he has my prayers.
Imagine how much less attention this vile group would have gotten if the left and msm didn't have such hatred for elected president.
Liar he condemned all violence why didn't Obama
This coming from a senator who withheld rape kits from being DNA tested in Nevada as a atty general!
Opposite of fascist,racist,violent Antifa isn't fascist,racist,violent white supremacists.Just diff left extremist groups.
He should DEFEND fascist,racist,violent Antifa & BLM?Or condemn them & white supremacists ALL as violent left extremists.
@realDonaldTrump stood up for America and 1st amendment rights. We will not be bullied out of our rights to demonstrate by liberals.
Bullshit
Maybe he don't know how
How many times must he say it?? Are you Deaf or just Dumb?
Wow..he never sided with them before so why AGAIN. stop the lies. He is doing what his voters asked him 2 do without race baiting
And "yet again", HOW CAN YOU LIE SO DELIBERATELY??!! President Trump did not do what you say, just the opposite.  Shame on you!  GOD hears.
And, yet again, he'll get a pass from #GOP and Dems alike.
These words are TOO SOFT!! STRONGER!!!
Please, call for him to step down.
Not gonna happen
#ImpeachTrump
@SenateDems  25th amendment. It's past time. Please act. He does not represent us and cannot fulfill the duties of the office.
Not gonna happen
Get this guy out of office before we all regret it.
Senator, TY 4 stating Amer. values. This discord will not end 'til every MofC makes clear no President can unravel our nation with prejudice
@realDonaldTrump just sold the White House is officially now the White Nationalists House Of The @POTUS
I listened,as well. Stop lying and bloviating.
no and no
It was the ILLEGALS who had NO permission to assemble there who started ALL the violence BEFORE and AFTER those legally pemitted disbanded.
Trump will continue to fail because #TrumpLies and #TrumpisaFailure
Well Senator, you certainly have some fine people who share your opinion.
@realDonaldTrump @SenCortezMasto - senator, what planet are you from? What will satisfy you? POTUS strongly denounced hate groups. Smh
@GOP in action...those in support of removing the offensive monuments "should be LYNCHED!" -#Republican Rep. #KarlOliver of #Mississippi
Get this man out of our White House.
Didn't your mother teach you if you didn't have something good to say THEN SAY NOTHING
He must go.. If you are a senator stand up use your voice
You should be asking for his resignation! That is the only answer!
Not when opposition hides a baseball bat under the guise it was a sign post
Seriously: what is wrong with USA POTUS?!?!  Embarrassing.  Disgusting.  Shameful.  It hurts to know a US President is a NAZI supporter
That's just stupid and we all know stupid can not be fixed
Senator......it's time for the 25th amendment.
No he didn't, but again today you stood up for criminal non-citizens.
When will we see articles of impeachment?
@SenCortezMasto call for the man's resignation immediately for the good of the United States.
Indirectly he is threatening every minority of this land color or religion. He is giving green light for those racists to continue rallying
How dare @POTUS say those words, he is washing his hands n laughing to the country . He is part of these groups. He is a racist since 
DO SOMETHING! For God's sake! HELP US!
Get rid of resistance
Impeach

#impeachTrump
He only lives up to himself.
Definitely the WORST press conference ever! Scapegoating those who stood up against white supremacy! Also promoted his winery!
You and Congress must remove him. Our country will not survive if he remains in power.
Thank you for standing up to hate, Senator
Nope. He did not do that. He once again was clear in his condemnation of neo-Nazis and white supremacists
We can't let this happen - this has to be stopped. We are no longer a free nation, we live at the whim of a disgusting failure. #Freedom
Do your job Senator. Protect our country. Organize your peers and remove a mentally incapacitated Trump.
GET HIM OUT!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #FUCKTRUMP #FUCK YOU @realDonaldTrump
Thank you for standing up for Americans.
He is unfit for office. 25th amendment time way overdue
When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. - Maya Angelou
Whoever was expecting him to ever act presidential or let's say ' decent ' - was and is completely at fault. He is n will remain jerk.
What will it take for the US legislature to stand up to Trump before he destroys the foundations of American democracy?
A Nazi sympathizer has no place in our government
You again, Senator+staff, didnt listen
Please say these words Senator: "I demand you resign immediately for the good of the USA." Please say those words.
