@LOLGOP The ACA is too expensive but we are going to pay billions for the #fuckingwall ?? 
I don't understand any of this.
@jessesingal Christ on a stick....How do you guys put up with this bullshit
My ladder factory is already under construction in Juarez.  Don't blow this for me.
.@jonathanweisman
MIT article suggest cost closer to $30-40 billion. That's a lot of chalupas.
@MichaelSkolnik this is a joke right?
Why not just have a moat filled with Russian pee? The Juans & Nitas will say "F that. I'm not going in there"
After seeing how the EPA operates in PA with fracking (terribly), clearly they need closer to the $14b. Sad.
It will likely end up costing the American Taxpayer $25-30 billion by the time its done.
@LOLGOP but!but! but! but!....Mexicans.
@Hushes  by several builders the estimated cost of that wall exceeds 80 billion maybe over 100. Drones can fly over it.
...and tunnels have been known to be effective as well.
@SwanWhisperr Goes 2 show u #GOP congress has Lousy Priorities Wall more important than Funding EPA
Just Our world At Stake
Since it will be impossible to patrol, how are they going to keep it safe from $10 shovels?
Don't worry, the whole thing is just a money laundering scheme for Russian mobsters
You'd think the casino would have been a safer bet.  It takes talent to screw up one of those!
#AMEN--NOW WE LIVE IN #GOP FANTASY #WORLD--X-BOX I JUST THOUGHT OF NEW GAME--BUILD #GOP FANTASYworld &WATCH IT #BLOW UP!!!
@MichaelSkolnik don't forget flint
@aravosis #NoBanNoWall
Trump's reign should be enough to make all immigrants want to stay away from this country. No wall necessary.
@MichaelSkolnik we don't need the EPA. The wall will keep pollution out along with the rapists, murderers and drug dealers
@onlxn Instead of wasting money on a wall that will not work, why not hire more agents? More effective and way cheaper.
my brain can’t comprehend that this is an actual conversation we are having. It’s terrible, terrible satire.
yeah, but that was just for the dumb environment; this is to keep us safe from imaginary boogeymen (w/out ladders)
GOP Congress approves funding to research transgendered elephants.
California high speed rail projected to be $100 billion.  I don't believe this wall can be built for $14b.
The EPA isn't derp enough....
But MEXICO.......................

it will never be finished, it will stand there, half built, for decades as a reminder of Trumps failure.
Or until it gets torn down. 
I prefer they just cut holes in it for people to go through, leave the half built thing as a monument to failure.
a couple of RPGs sent into the construction crews and nobody will want to be building it
you changed it. Nut up for what you want! Coward
And by "14" they mean "28" #minimum
Funding 1 yr of single agency is not comparable to funding a long-discussed building of a national border (+ Savings from fewer crossings).
@AnnieLowrey well, to be fair, the actual cost of EPA is probably tens of billions at least. That said, the wall sucks too
yeah, but the EPA isn't making us safer from isis. Breathable air and clean water are not worth that expense. 
except that 14 nil might stop a problem - not keep generating new ones #beurocracybreedsbeurocracy
@JustWhatNowWhy Republicans love pollution.
jfc...
@warrior_tank is the president even stable enough to ubderstand......anything beyond his wallet?
@JulyJane @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Does that ring a bell!
"Fiscal Conservative" = Someone who only approves deficit spending on conservative policies
Of course, they did. Obama suggested it. Why listen to logic when you can listen to insanity?
@Ellwood26 @realDonaldTrump investing in Louisiana Sea Wall and flood prevention
cc @SenSanders @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
@SethDavisHoops you have NO CLUE as to the total cost for undocumented workers, illegals, drain on our $ resources ???
@jarowell wall is for #trumpsego we don't need wall- we need healthcare!!
@SophiaBush is anyone else thinking Berlin Wall?
EPA was unaffordable because a black guy asked for the money. See? It all makes sense now.
jeez
@HumaImtiaz - And it could be secured with current budget.
@kairyssdal took GOP less than a week to go from "not $1 spending for $10 in cuts" to "let's buy dune buggies!".
@d0nc0smic Well protecting borders is what the Feds are suppose to do. The rest well where is it mandated.
typical Republican hypocrisy
When was the last time the federal government built something that came in at or below budget?
- it's more than the EPA and FDA budgets combined
BUSH Was Given The Funds For A Wall Which He NEVER USED... The Seed Of Cain And Their Ignorance... SAD
@PaulBegala JON & POLLY EPA is scam so people like U can pocket the $. Shrimp stress test. SOLINDRA, fish stress. YOUR CUT?
@7im Trump will hire workers used in the past by him, who will finally get paid. And cost for wages owed will be built in.
@TheBaxterBean what is wrong with congress?  Step up. If can't do job cause ur scared, we can find a woman to take ur place
@rodriguez_linda almost like it was never about the money
@TheBaxterBean THIS IS IMMORAL in a nation where any1 goes hungry
@TheBaxterBean Plus big cost overruns (100% likely given flimsy plans)
of course GOP will spend like drunken sailors now that they have DT in the WH. National debt will climb.
@GailSimone what if we give smog and carbon emissions a Mexican sounding name? Like what worked when cannabis>marijuana
ask the folks in texas if they want the gov to take their land to build a wall. That's a big NO!
@RonaldKlain Will this wake up gullible blind supporters of worthless hypocrites like #PaulRyan ? No sirs #bigotry rules
I still say makeit a state wouldbe cheaper evenafter the whole warthing  noone would complain about illegals then
not true I complain bitterly about Mississippi
YEAH but Mississippi isn't a country its just an embarassment. some of my family from there
@victory1261 I think th whole thing is bullshit
Congress is not for, by or of the people any more. It is bought and paid for by corporate 'donations'
over how many years was that 8.2 b supposed to be spread across
7,500+ mi of border & 88,000 mi of coastline makes security a rather monumental/impossible task.
EPA > A wall.
I want to know who is going to fill all the jobs that are currently filled by illegals. Unemployed rust belt workers? Nah.
#GOP_hypocrisy !!
$8.2b is unaffordable because the epa causes massive economic harm.
@kairyssdal except the border budget was already approved during Obama's term but he let it sit
@kairyssdal guy I know blew up in anger at $221 million that was to go to Palestine for humanitarian stuff.
And yet he wants the wall built.
$14 Billion is low ball for #TheWall @jonathanweisman more like $42 Billion, 3+ aircraft carriers
if only the wall was high enough to keep the US pollutants in, then the rest of the world would win.
I'm sure we have three more walls and a roof coming. Homelessness solved, prison for everyone.
that'd do well for the 2020 election slogan, Build The Roof!
Another election? A boy can dream!
Budgets are for Democrats! It don't matter no more.
The entire budget for ICE is around $5B.  Congress would not fund Bush's Secure Fence Act of 2006 past $1.8B!
Great. So now let's talk about the costs of illegal immigration to the country.
@fromthedil .Crazy he wants build himself for his EGO, a monument? $14 bill worth PRES.O!Only wanted $8Bil.For healthcare!
but we're gonna get it back. trump said so. And he tells THE truth.
@stephentotilo We know that estimate is laughably low as well. It won't be done in 4 years. Tack on the cost to dismantle 
The people will do it for free
@PaulBegala Flint!!!
@PaulBegala and yet people worries about loosing healthcare, flint water and so many other things much more important
@hottakeharry They can afford it now that they're taking away healthcare, Medicare and social security.
All those poor Trump puppets that thought they could believe the GOP.
@BigFren they won't be saying that this time
@meganliberman But they'll do anything for Trump because they're his puppets
Block any construction of Trumps Folly unless he can be walled up in it
Retweet over and over again
@JWGOP 
Just wondering about cost of ACA?
.@jonathanweisman, maybe congress will have courage to say 'you want it, you pay for it yourself' directly to #DirtyDonald.
@tvpventures are you sure a wall like he envisions woyldn't cost 50 times that?
Yes, I think it was wrong . 25 b, that's what I heard lately..
I just can't see something like he imagines costing less than a trillion.
yeah, but that was a Democratic President, so it doesn’t matter
@LOLGOP well to be fair Mexico... wasn't payi..... haha I can't. I can't even say it. I don't know how he does it.
Trump Day 7
Trump signs exec. order banning drive-through Mexican restaurants
but they have the best taco bowls !
That brings the partisanship into focus as much or more as it puts the cost into perspective. Thx for the info either way.
@daveweigel maybe put solar panels on the top? Make everybody happy.
Pity the idiot will use concrete to build it and use the solar to electrify it
@LOLGOP Trump& GOP will spend fortune on wall but don't care abt wellbeing & lives lost throwing 30 million off healthcare.
@theonlyadult Has anyone compared this to the much hated Berlin Wall? I know this is different but....
What is more important? Save the world for future generations or it would be great if this place was a little whiter.
I know it isn'tfunny, but this made me laugh. We need a little less white.
@GrnEyedMandy Est is low, with their tax cuts deficit will blow up $$ needed better not be on backs of seniors SS Medicare
@SophiaBush Won't do much, because airplanes exists
lol why pay 250k for a lambo when you want a 400k ferrari?
Mexico is paying so our cost is $0...Congress will love that cost to USA taxpayers.
people still pretending we won't recover wall cost through future foreign aide and trade deals is just spreading fear.
@LOLGOP Make Texas pay for it.
Not going to happen for $14B if it is any kind of serious barricade.
I wish he'd switch to some sensible jobs program instead, like building himself a giant golden pyramid
I'll take the over on $20BN for the wall.
Who do you get to build a wall? Mexican contractors.  Who doesn't he pay? Contractors. #nowall
