How can you be so asinine. DJT is enforcing the Law and removing illegals who have committed crime.
Re-election is coming! Let's see what your constituents will respond to your illegal immigrants agenda.... You will be fired!
Thank you both for doing what you can.
I assume you will tweak this next week, since #WH legal not pursuing original, issueing a new one
Plus it is based on racial/religious/national prejudice.
can you please remind me where in the constitution does it state the we should not have borders?
Support our president! His order is completely warranted. Think about our people first!
I pay your salary, but you don't speak for me. Give up your perks and salary; sponsor an immigrant family.
you too were an immigrant family once. How soon people forget where their ancestors came from
.@SenFeinstein .@SenCortezMasto Please vote NO on Gorsuch nomination!
THANK YOU both. Let's get this hate-filled order repealed.
@HispanicCaucus @SenCortezMasto Since when are "open borders" & betrayal of US sovereignty "American" values? #Traitors
@HispanicCaucus @SenCortezMasto your values, not the American values.
please review what is going on in #Paris due to #refugees from #TheReligionOfPeace. Your duty protect  #USA
you are betraying democracy and the people. The obsession u all have in ruining this for his supporters is
What values? To bring hordes of unvetted refugees and destroy America like European liberals destroy Europe?
There is a new one scheduled to come out early next week..
maybe, but how many homeless do we have now. Take care of our own first
you expect her to listen?
your values are anti- American comrade feinstein!
because we want to protect our citizens from criminals while you sit behind your gated community &armed guards
First off you don't speak for me. 2nd, President Trump's EO is legal and it has been a long time coming!
@HispanicCaucus @SenCortezMasto just the illegal ones
a little late to the party, no??
Please try. He has another one in the works
Thank you @SenFeinstein and @SenCortezMasto for standing up for our founding principles.
what values and just exactly who's are they? To stop illegal immigration and follow the law is not a betrayal
You've got the idea! Congrats!!!
did not think you had ANY VALUES
Pure Kabuki theater & you both know it.
Thank you,  Senators!
isn't this a waste of time since court already blocked it? Please spend your time on things that matter. Jesus
Keep grandstanding, it's all a pathetic, free falling Democrats have left. Very amusing.
Hypocrite !! Did not betray your values when Obama did the exact same thing. You and Masto both Hypocrites!!!
It was already illegal and unconstitutional. What will new law say, "We really mean it this time!"? #impeach
Betrays our values?  For an insecure border and terror threats. That's what you are propagating.
so law and order and security betray US values?
No need for grand-standing. He said he'll do it !
This is a good team.
He said today he was not pursuing current EO, new one to be released next week. Bill just for ????
:  NO it doesn't.  POTUS is trying very hard to secure America's borders and safety, ignored by Mr. Obama
Must be nice to be so insulated from the consequences of the left's immigration policies.
Thank you for standing up for them!
You didn't complain when Obama did the same thing? What's changed?
it does not betray our values to live by the laws of this land.  Ilegal Immigration needs to be stopped.
shameful? It's OK to allow felons, sexual predators to run free?
way to go senators
You would know something about betrayal, wouldn't you...
Thank you! The Californians will lead the nation.
@kh93291 @SenFeinstein @SenCortezMasto old  _ _ _ _ _.
you value breaking the law? That makes you irrelevant then doesn't it, lawmaker?
Thank you for doing this for US CITIZENS married to immigrants!
How are you going to vote on Pruitt? I hope it is a NO
ok, so if they can break the law because they want to, I can rob a bank because I'm poor?
@MarleneUsaa1 And look at the poor people ICE is picking on. Really. Rapists murderers per trump. Not happeng.
.@SenFeinstein It's going nowhere. And you know it. Distraction & obstruction. Trump super majority in 2018. Wait & see.   @SenCortezMasto
No it does not!  We are a nation of laws, follow them!  We're sick of the laws being treated as suggestions!  @Truthseer1961
please push for Russia investigation.
Didn't @potus already say that he would repeal it and issue a new and improved order? You're late to the party
illegals need to respect our nations laws stop defending them and defend citizens!
Let's see how far that gets you. You have no solutions #whyyoulost
Non-citizens have no constitutional rights.
Read the 14th Amendment.
Thank you both for your courage, leadership and service to all American citizens. I am a grateful one.
Y'all might want to wait and see what version 2.0 looks like!
thank you!
