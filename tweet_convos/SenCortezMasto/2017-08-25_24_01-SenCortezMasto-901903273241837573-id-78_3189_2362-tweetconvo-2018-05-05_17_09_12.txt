Your website appears to only accept donations from folk living in the USA - isn't that a bit shortsighted? I'd like to help from the uk!
Hi Jane, If you're interested in donating from the UK, our PayPal account accepts international donations through http://HELPSALVATIONARMY.org 
What percent of donation goes directly to aid? I've heard it's higher in crisis, but it affects where I give at this time.
Hi Dustin, During emergency disasters, 100% of designated gifts are used to support relief efforts.
When you text, how much will it donate or can we set the amount??
Hi @AllenCramer, you will be redirected to our donations website, http://HELPSALVATIONARMY.org , and can donate an amount of your choosing
Amen
No pay pal?
Hi Darren, a PayPal donation can be made on our relief effort website, http://HELPSALVATIONARMY.org .
Did not scroll down enough, just did it. Thanks for all y'all do!!!
How much is the donation if I text to storm?
Hi @vjeannek, you will be redirected to our donations website, http://HELPSALVATIONARMY.org , and can donate an amount of your choosing
Unless, of course, victims are homosexual. The Salvation Army is a religious group that discriminates against gays, even if they're in need.
Not true, friend. We help all people regardless of orientation.
Sadly, that is not true. See this:
That article you sent me does say that we help all people without discrimination.
How about this article? Does this establish your ideal of no discrimination?
If you ever encounter what this describes, you should contact SA headquarters immediately and file a complaint.
Like how the one woman who brought to light the horrible conditions occurring in her SA shelter and got kicked out for her trouble? Sure.
Thankfully the truth isn't subject to your opinion.
Retweet and keep adding to the page of ANTIFA and other groups. Overload them with Red Cross requests

#donate  to #both #local and #national #disaster #Relief #Charities @SalvationArmyUS
@realDonaldTrump why don't you just donate here instead and skip your trip to Texas. We need the money more than your presence.
best organization in the world for helping people.  I have seen them in action first hand helping victims of disaster.
I Did  We ALL SHOULD THAT ARE ABLE TO DO SO 
Some of the comments here are sad. Not everything is an opportunity for pet political causes. If you're not going to be helpful, be quiet.
Well said. You spoke for me as well. People are suffering unbelievably. Not the time for politics. Take care.
Thank you, you as well.
JUST DONATED.  They will need all the help they can get. Please RT and give what you can.  This is America. This is us!
Retweeted. I just donated too.
Hey Salvation Army! I don't have any money to spare, but I have furniture and clothes I can donate! Tell me how!
I can donate items as well, but not sure how to go about it
2) Check back with your local SA in a bit and you may be able to donate goods. Thanks for offering help!
Absolutely. The stuff is packed up and ready to go.
Perfect! 
So very many have rushed to help. Please post how monies are being allocated so that people can see all the good you don
How long until our billionaire “president” makes a substantial personal donation? 

I suggest $1 billion?

Hey Donald - I dare you
Don't do it donate to http://mercury.org  100 percent goes to the victims salvation army has over head they do not give back 100 percent
Tell salvation army to start putting all there book donations on the thrift store selves did they buy this pallet of bottle water/donated$$$
Surely there's a better org than this homophobic, transphobic one getting help to those in need? SA helps selectively based on their values
SenErnst:maybe you could give!The NRA paid you $3.1MILLION dollars from their weapons sales. You make a XLG profit from weapons/machine guns

Yea they want that money to help go in there thrift stores they put the junk out and sell the good stuff other places they should have money
They should be helping people every day go to there thrift stores try to buy a book to resale to pay your power bill or water bill you cant
They put the trash on the shelves in there thrift store and sell the good stuff other places were is that money I have seen alot wrong
Thanks for everything you have done and are doing.  God Bless!
How much did the telethon raise
Beaumont citizens are telling me they desperately need water!
@peletechcorp lauds the #SalvationArmy and their assistance in  #HurricaneHarveyRelief efforts.
How much of my money goes to the people?
@ChelseaClinton Are they still virulently antigay?
I just did a text donation.  How do I know amount and if they received
I believe more funds get where needed vs Red Cross. FWIW my donation goes to Salvation Army.
They are great people but  should give and do more for their warehouse recovering addict workers
Amazing photo - thank you for what you're doing to help those in need!
CHELSEA, NO.

How to donate after Hurricane Harvey http://causeandeffect.fm/how-to-donate-after-hurricane-harvey-1798478551?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=Cause_And_Effect_twitter …
I trust them to use the donations wisely. Doing the Lord's work.
No donation is too small. Remember if 1,000,000 people each gave a $1 you would be part of a $1,000,000 donation.
Many many prayers 
Do you plan on setting up a way to donate through text without having to go to the website?
out of all charitable org's this one is outstanding in getting the funds to those who need it
Indeed. Doing the Lord's work.
I have an extra bedroom and bath (Jax, Fl ) that I can offer to anyone who is homeless from the hurricane if arranged through SA.
Please let me know here which number to call to assist SA with housing. Thanks.
FLeecing of hard working Americans-again? Use funds u have that were going 2 Trump Maralago Golf! My $$ assist to local shelters! @RedCross
Do you have any idea how many such shelters @SalvationArmyUS runs? If all you have to offer is Trump hate, perhaps it's time to hush.

Use the money you were ready to spend at Mar-A-Lago.
I think it was Red Cross at Mar-A-Lago
Also Salvation Army.
They've both cancelled.
I'll give my money to a secular organization, thanks.

America, time to dig deep to help those about to be impacted by Hurricane #Harvey give to  @RedCross  https://www.redcross.org/donate/hurricane-harvey?campname=Harvey&campmedium=aspot …
Remember The Salvation Army is one of a few charities trying to damage our president. Find other charities to give to.
I'll make sure I donate to all of the charities that have told @realDonaldTrump to shove it!
Survived 3 hurricanes, including a Hurricane Hugo, I can attest Salvation Army & Red Cross are 1st to arrive, last to leave helping all.
