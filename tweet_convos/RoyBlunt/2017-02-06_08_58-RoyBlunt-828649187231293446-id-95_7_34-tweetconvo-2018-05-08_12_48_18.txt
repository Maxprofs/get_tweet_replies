you don't care about black history. You're future vote for @SenatorSessions proves that. Did he buy you just like Betsy did???
Silencing Sen. Eliz Warren as she reads words of MLK's widow-NOT honoring civil rights ldrs. NO Sessions. #resist #JeffSessions
perhaps you could honor them by not approving @JeffSessionsrbx - the man Coretta Scott King knew was too racist to be a judge.
keep your ridiculous, pandering, canned comments. You are a fake.
You just approved a racist as AG, so how are you working to help blacks? 
you dishonor civil rights
You are a racist and sexist. Keep his name out your mouth.
You can't confirm President & creator of Fascist Group & pretend you care about #BlackHistoryMonth Actions matter
except for Mrs. KIng. Right Roy boy?
who do you work for? Taxpayers or billionaires??
you are such a hypocrite. By voting on devoss' entry as SEC of education you have just screwed your constituents. Sad. BIGLY sad.
Sure, tweeting a picture of a monument to MLK will compensate for backing a racist opposed to civil rights as Attorney General.
by voting not to hear word spoken by Dr. Kings widow? That's a strange way to "honor leaders"
Of which challenges are you speaking, and with whom are you working? #BlackHistoryMonth
After constituents remind @RoyBlunt, he finally acknowledges something about #BlackHistoryMonth a week into February. Thank you, Roy.
and yet you're voting for Jeff Sessions, you are a liar and you sold your vote to a billionaire.
Shame on you and your party that sold your souls to the special interests. Your words mean nothing. We Will #resist
SO NOW GO ON BACK INTO YOUR SAFE HOLE WHILE OUR CHILDREN SUFFER #WORSTSENATOREVER
Lol, only black people politicians know during #blackhistorymonth is MLK
do American Indians have a history month? what about other races? why R they treated better than original inhabitants of America?
It's hard to take you seriously on this topic when you support Trump and Sessions.
you dishonor all americans with your support of unqualified and rascist appointees
hypocrite #resist
Honor them? You mean slap them in the face and send them back to the dark ages.
vote no to #devos You speak for US, remember?
SHAME ON YOU for voting to Silencing Elizabeth Warren. Are you that afraid of Mrs. King's words? #letlizspeak #ShePersisted
you voted party and NOT people!
Way to listen to your constituents about DeVos.  I mean who cares about kids anyway right? Truly a man of the people.
Seriously? How can you even post this with a straight face? Say it with your votes, not these lame posts.
and to honor them, you are voting in a racist for AG.
.@RoyBlunt unless their words scare is right? #letlizspeak #CowardMcconnell
families will have more problems now with DeVos
As Cory Booker explained last night the Dept of Edu has a major role to play in civil rights. #OpposeDeVos
Vote NO on DeVos! Our children deserve better and as a former educator yourself, you know better!
Sir, it is not too late for you to choose country over party and vote against DeVos.
I realize that you have many constituents to consider in this matter, but Ms DeVos is objectively unqualified for this role.
The only reason that Ms DeVos has been nominated for this role is because of her monetary contributions to your party.
I greatly respect your work for veterans and mental healthcare, sir, but you will lose my future support if you confirm Ms DeVos
Do you plan to call out @POTUS for his attack on judiciary or keep silent as he undermines Constitution?  Don’t be a coward.
#noDevos How dare you pretend to care about MO and sell your vote to devos.
A vote for sessions is an insult to the legacy of MLK. Wait. Did you have DeVos for history class?
if you really honor them you'd look out for the children that he was fighting for and sent #DeVosvote  #holdthefloor
civil right? While Missouri families are ripped in Family courts and severed by CPS? Nonsense.....wake up. Senator up will ya.
.@royblunt @BetsyDeVos didn't know diff between growth & http://proficiency.Vote  no so Trump may choose someone competent.#StopDeVos
.@royblunt You saw how poorly @BetsyDeVos performed at her confirmation hearing. Please put duty above party & vote against her. #StopDeVos
do not underestimate the power of a group of organized educators advocating for their students. VOTE #NOonBetsyDeVos !!
parents, teachers and students will know who to blame when our schools are drained of resources and kid's futures are destroyed.
you are selling our students to the highest donor! We see you. We see through you. Stop it! Vote NO on Devos.
like education? Best way to help there? Vote AGAINST DeVos.
If you truly support what Dr King stood for, then you will VOTE NO on devos and sessions!!!
incorrect. King stood for non violent discussion. He represents something much more intelligent and lasting than hatred.
nice fake sentiment, you voted for Jeff Sessions who opposes everything MLK stood for #Shame #NoonDeVos
$33,100 in donations from #DeVos  More than a poverty level family in your state makes yearly. You care about no one but yourself.
No on DE Voss.  Not qualified,  you know this is true. She will collapse the public shool system. Disgraceful.
VOTE NO NO NO on #BetsyDeVos she will hurt not help!  Unqualified and prepared only for HER AGENDA--religious schools--not public
a way to honor these leaders would be to take a stand against against Bannon and voting against the Sessions nomination.
You have no moral compass or spine to support your constituents. We are stronger together. You will hear our votes.
oppose Betsy If you care about this country and all Americans.
.@RoyBlunt approving Jeff Sessions as AG is a slap in the face to all who cherish MLK and what he fought for.
Honor Dr. King and others by saying "no" to DeVos.
if you really honor them, then heed Coretta Scott King's warning about  Jefferson Beauregard Sessions and vote no!
is laughing as he counts the stack of Benjamin's given to him by DeVos.
By supporting Trump & Bannon as they shut down DOJ review of abusive police practices? Do the right thing. http://time.com/4641374/trump-inuaguration-police-protestors-justice/ …
Please say NO to Betsy Devos.
For a Tweet to reach Roy, you must give him, er, I mean, donate $10k.
200k per nominee.
We're challenged by a lying, propaganda-disseminating, racist regime. Still waiting for you to work on that.
#NotoDevos
#DumpDevos
Don't die on this hill, sir. We won't forgive or forget.
#DontFuckWithOurKids
This disingenuous tweet  is recognized as such. Try harder.
Like education?! We realize u feel indebted 2 DeVos for HUGE contributions to Matt & your campaigns, not too late to say #noDevos
A good start would be to denounce DJT exec order on refugees #NoBanNoWall
atta boy! Put it on your calendar next year to honor #BlackHistoryMonth before Heart attack awareness, mmmmk?
Who's this "we", Senator?  You ignore your constituents, so who's this "we"?
by supporting trump and all he stands for? U should b ashamed!! Esp for voting yes for DeVos. We all know u took her money
These are nice words, but what are you doing to keep black men and women safer against unlawful arrests and police brutality?
Nice pic! That $30k from DeVos buy you a new @Nikon ?   Your constituents don't want her, but > voters right?
if you really mean this then vote NO on Sessions and NO on DeVos.
the vote no on Betsy DeVos 
who's this "we", Senator?  Your support for President Trump's policies Dishonors memory of Civil Rights Movement!
I hope this means that you support criminal justice reform and protecting the rights and accessibility of all voters.
By confirming #JeffSessions to AG post, repealing the #ACA and defunding #PlannedParenthood ? You gotta do better than that.
Name some of those leaders.  You can Google, because I am sure like our so called president you don't know. #BowlingGreenMasacre
I have this statue at my pool, @RoyBlunt. I love this guy. One of my favorite blacks of all time.
Lol almost fell for this Donu1d 
How are you working to end the continuing inequality in our society? What are you doing to end injustice?
Yes!! I agree!Let's tackle ACA as one whole people. Let's work on schools! Let's work police and community partnership!
