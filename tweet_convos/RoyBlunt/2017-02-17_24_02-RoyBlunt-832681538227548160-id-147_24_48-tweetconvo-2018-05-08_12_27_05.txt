to where we started. Obama got us out of the mess Bush put us in. Trump is setting the gov. up for himself & friends for after...
I disagree also! He is the worse person the president could of chose for this job. WHY the republicans voted him through is...
implement solar and clean alternative sources and you wouldn't need to strip back environmental protections.
books for our kids here in Hallsville. We can't understand common core, and can't help them without books to bring home. Money..
I do not agree with this appointment or much environmental deregulation. We need to protect the environment for our future gens.
How much did you make voting for 45's cabinet picks? Corrupt Crony!
When all have lung disease, arsenic & lead poisoning, and coastal cities under water, will you foot the bills?  NO? Keep EPA
I'd rather pay a little more in utility to ensure our state and country stay as free of pollution as possible.
ME TOO!  What a bull answer Roy

Pruitt has SUED the EPA 14 times, so tell me how he would effectively lead the EPA?
The recent release of emails concerning Scott Pruitt and his ties to fossil fuel companies should bring big concerns about Pruitt!
beyond me. How can he head this when he has law suits against them? He doesn't care about the air we breathe, or the water we need
Pruitt is bought by the fossil fuel industry CORRUPTION GALORE - http://bit.ly/2kMJZ3H  - clean energy will reduce utility bills
are you insane? Climate change is real and Pruitt disagrees with science.
Cheaper utility bills aren't worth an unlivable future. It has been 70deg across MO all week. In Feb. You know something's wrong.
shame on you for not defending the EPA and the planet.
Thanks for throwing the environment away.
what!? Stand up for your constituents! Do your job!
man is our President. I can't answer them. We don't have textbooks for our kids in school, spend the billions for a dumb wall on..
emails speak louder than you. Reform is not destruction. DeVos, Sessions, Pruitt are appts you're wrong on. We will not forget.
News flash: we still have to live here after the environment is screwed. And you helped! Enjoy that legacy.
Shame on you. We remember . You will not be reelected. I want clean air,water, no fracking earthquakes, protected endangered
He's just been re-elected to 6-year term...a political eternity & not sweating re-election. Push to OH statehouse, US House Rep.
The republicans are removing regulations that were put in place for a reason. Like the one for wall street! Were going back...
I'm a #MO constituent. Lower my bills & scrap Clean Power, my KIDS pay price. Clean air, lower carbon emissions top priority. #CPP
You don't represent my family's views on this issue. I wonder who is paying you  (and Pruitt!) to think this way? #darkmoney
You're as guilty as he is for poisoning us & this propaganda post is sickening. If you cared you'd clean up industrial processes.
for a dumb wall that won't stop them, and deporting millions that help our country which will cost a fortune. Use it for schools!
their 4 YEARS in office, IF he makes it to 4. I've never been so scared in my life with Trump. Our lives are at stake with our...
Scott Pruitt does not respect or care about EPA or the environment.  Look at his mess in Oklahoma.  How can you sleep at night?
Dirty air ALSO costs the taxpayers in higher healthcare costs.  You're more concerned about your fossil fuel industry donors.
So your point is the priority of @EPA is to lower utilities, not protect environment?
Confusing how some 'conservatism' has devolved to mean passing problems to kids generation for short-term gain. @EPA
allies for GOD sakes! No one in the world trusts us anymore due to his tweets. My young grandchildren has asked me why this mean..
so excited to drink poisoned water and drink poisoned air.
too bad he doesn't believe in the very real problem of climate change
This is not a Town Hall meeting that your constituents are demanding.  Put one on your calendar. #demandingaccountability
this man has no desire to protect the environment. This scorched earth crap has to stop
Nurses get stuff done.  Add me to your campaign list if you do decide to run. 
Really? He has experience suing the EPA, so I guess abolishing it will rein it in, all right.
I would rather pay now than have my kids have to pay later
maybe if you had a town hall, you could hear your constituents saying they are willing to pay more to protect the environment.
no he does not! Do you have children? Grandchildren? They are going to have to clean up your mess! Are you thinking of the future?
#fakenews
- when will you be having a town hall in St Louis?
Please - I am your constituent.  I am willing to pay a little more if it means my daughter and I will have clean air and water.
Scott Pruitt is a disaster... Senator we want a town hall

Sincerely,
  Your constituents
I'd rather pay marginally higher utillites than continue an unsustainable course that pollutes & makes MO uninhabitable over time
I will GLADLY pay higher utility bills if it means that I get my power from clean sources, thereby leaving a planet for my kids!
all I'm hearing from you as a MO Voter is, "Blah, blah, blah... I value money over a clean environment."
what environment will he leave for our children. My utility in stl bills are just fine
your grandchildren will be ashamed of what you did to their planet.  #CongressDoYourJob
Extremely disappointed that you voted for FRACKING EARTHQUAKE Pruitt. Wrecked his state and will now be free to damage ours.
As long as we stop #polluting with #coal plants and move toward reliance on renewables, then the burden is worth it! @MOSolarApps
.@RoyBlunt guess what? I like water that I can drink and air that I can breathe.
Didn't this fail in 2014? U didn't get the memo that some people actually like our planet? Ever been hunting or fishing? Like it?
We, the citizens of Missouri, want clean air, clean water, and wild spaces for all! They are our life support system! Not $$$$$$$!
Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times, there will be no incentive to hold companies accountable. Listen.
Scott Pruitt is basically a damn Captain Planet villain, as his time being Attorney General in Oklahoma shows. Not a good pick.
he wants to kill EPA.  Obviously you don't believe in my MO children clean water and clean air!
you're nothing but a sell out
and fewer air regs drive up disease rates in our state. I guess you won't be bothered though, what with your head up your bum.
What is my kids' future worth to you? In 50 years they will still need an inhabitable planet. When we need action we get denial.
and u r a fool to say that.  he sued the EPA over a dozen times and doesnt believein global climate change party before country
Show Me a Missourian that doesn't need clean air or clean water.
No worries - with all the money we save on utilities we'll just drink champagne & stay too intoxicated to notice we can't breathe.
yes he knows nothing about climate change.   How many earthquakes in OK
amazing how you come out after he gets voted in. didn't want to take the heat before the vote? #coward
Confirming Scott Pruitt to run EPA is like hiring a taxidermist to run the zoo.
Have you spent a week in Beijing, trying to breathe?  Maybe you should.
What?? Are you indebted to fossil fuel companies??
.I can't imagine how anyone can claim Pruitt is good for EPA and Missouri.  Most Republicans care about the environment!
He doesn't believe in the EPA & if Oklahoma (& their fracking earthquakes) is an example of his "great" leadership. I'm good.
have you been drinking the same koolaid as 45? Pruitt is against the EPA? How much money did he donate to you?
traitor to MO
rising utility bills?  That's what worries you?  How about saving the damn planet.???
What are you talking about? How can you even say this with a straight face? Town Hall Meeting, please.
when are you coming home for a town hall?
.@RoyBlunt You are either in the pockets of the fossil fuel industry or extremely short sighted, probably both. As a MO res. I'm disgusted.
he's the devil to the EPA. You are toast next election.
I also disagree Senator! He is completely inappropriate for this position.
when U look @ epa original purpose & mission u will c they R no longer working on those stndrds. they hve bcome overreaching uslss
B.S.
You are a public servant Senator. Your job is to represent your constituents not the ones lining your pocket!
suing the EPA is not the experience we need.   Please start listening to your constituents. #roybluntTownhall  @STLPostDispatch
TRAITOR
I'm a Missourian who fled OK due in part to his destruction of the state EPA. You have betrayed my children by voting him in.
R U serious?! U coward! U clearly R not listening to #Missourians. We  u Sir and ur @SenateGOP party line politics #Kander2020

I disagree!
More expensive utilities, or unbreathable air? Hmm, let me think about this...
we really need you to have a town hall after all you are making awful decisions on our behalf. You quite apparently need our help!
Please sign a petition asking for a town hall. http://www.thepetitionsite.com/500/546/268/roy-blunt-we-want-a-town-hall-meeting-with-you/?src=facebook_ads … we're just 10k away from our goal!
just signed the petition hope you get twice as many as needed!!
Respectfully, Sen. Blunt won't care about petition. New 6-yr term. Donors, however...http://tinyurl.com/hpt57co 
LIAR!
so instead, we're going to vote for a shill for the fossil fuel industry. Good strategy there, Blunty.
Bullshit.
...and help kill the planet.
Besides lower utility bills thru renewable energy there is a health cost impact to coal as well.
blah blah blah.  We see you, Senator Blunt.
Couldn't we have tried to avoid cabinet members who r being investigated.
I'll keep an eye on my utility bill and see what happens, get back to you next year with the results! I won't forget this tweet.
who gives a fuck about the utility bill when you aren't going to be able to drink the water?
No.  Coal is more expensive & polluting than renewable energy.  Even China has figured that out.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Beijing_smog_comparison_August_2005.png/450px-Beijing_smog_comparison_August_2005.png …
someone needs to look into ameren ue's practices. Highest in the state and climbing why? They are the largest in the state.
when are republicans going to start putting country before party.   Pruitt is a disgrace and will dismantle the EPA.

It's 68 Degrees in February in STL. #CPP is needed to curb power plant carbon emissions.

Pruitt is unfit and the pushing of the vote without the benefit of the e-mails shows your constant disregard of your constituents
Yea it does indeed.  @RoyBluntMO is a #coward and a #Missouri traitor.
#kander2020 Vote for @JasonKander2020 @JasonKander
also, genius... on Twitter#CPP = C++
I need to know when your next town hall is happening. I want to have a discussion with you.
also not truly cost-savings: when people get sick from pollutants, they need healthcare=healthcare bills.
that's ok we have the ACA to help...oh, wait!
Scott Pruitt is a joke and you know it. NyQuil do not listen to science or your constituents
and by lead you mean dismantle. I hope it's worth it to you, Senator.
He is not.
or maybe his version of "lead" is actually "lead- the heavy metal"!
PRUITT'S CONFIRMATION IS A FARCE & BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
he has experience SUING the EPA. Not leading it or working with it.
Roy, Roy, Roy, you are sorely mistaken. We will now have to hold you accountable as well. #resist

someone from  @BrandNew535 asked me about running for office and I said no. I just changed my mind.
Yeah who needs clean air and water?
I am worried about how many times he sued the EPA. I think that says something about him, that he's biased against them
