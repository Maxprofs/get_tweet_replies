@RoyBlunt -You can't give all healthcare decisions to states, & then drastically cut their funds. 
70 million depend on #Medicaid - 1/2 kids
no one is taking state generated funding for Medicaid - flake news headlines playing citizens for fools
Bullshit John Spek. 740 billion in cuts til #Medicaid no longer exists. 10 years, it's gone. 
Stop propoganda. All major health orgs against
I see u know nothing about your state budget & u are easy to fool - google your state budget and see it 4 yourself
I'm not easy to fool, or a fool. I understand how this works. Do you? 
Why don't you Google the #GrahamCassidy Bill and read up on it.
ACA was passed so you could read it, in 2011 concern was already fed could reduce funding to state on Medicaid expansion below 90% at will
So @NancyPelosi said one sentence 7 years ago that made you @GOP want to fuck poor people over forever?! Grow up! #ACA had over 100 hearings
not the first part, the part snuck through just before Christmas. nice try though
and after 8 years they still didn't fix it
Vote NO on the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill. The Bill that would deny health care to 20-30 million, gut Medicaid & kill rural hospitals. BAD.
If you truly support healthcare and Missourians, you will vote no on Senator Graham Cassidy's bill.
Please. Retire. Today.
ACA rules -  millionaires get medicaid - how brilliant of Democrats
Thank you but this isn't enough! Please also vote no on the #GrahamCassidyBill
Thank you for this. But please do not support the GOP plan for health insurance. Thank you again.
Thank you for pushing for CHC funding. What will happen to the demands on these centers when people lose their Obamacare insurance.
FIX THE ACA SO WE ALL WILL STOP WORRYING ABOUT LOSING OUR LOVED ONE. IT WILL KILL MY HUSBAND, THE NEW GOP BILL! WHY ARE U SUPPORTING?
How about you just help Americans by supporting @SenSanders's Medicare for All bill?
What will happen to all those with preexisting conditions are denied coverage with the current GOP PLAN in the works in congress? Terrible!
I agree! That's a first.
But ALL Missourians rely on adequate, affordable healthcare coverage, which you're planning to take away via G-C bill. NO.
More people than that rely on Medicaid and the VA! Vote NO on the health care bill!
If #GrahamCassidy isn't good enough for you then it is not good enough for us. Vote No.
If you care about healthcare in this state/country VOTE NO ON #GrahamCassidyBill. It is time for you to stand w/ MO not insurance companies
Blunt you owe Missouri an apology,your 2faced on healthcare.talking up cancer research ,community health,then vote to strip funding
You might also consider blocking the Graham-Cassidy bill, which would strip Healthcare from tens of thousands of your constituents.
Maybe if you got the fuck off your ass& focused on bipartisan ACA stabilization instead of Graham Cassidy then CBO could finish scoring CHC
VOTE NO #GRAHAMCASSIDY! RUINING OUR HEALTHCARE FOR KOCHBROS 
?
that's right. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform â€¦
Prove it by voting against #GrahamCassidyBill  instead of looking smug standing behind McConnell as he tries to strip the #ACA
#GrahamCassidyBill should be a "No" vote! +Ask 4MoMedicaid Expansion too! Do you why Missourians find it hard to trust you? #ACASavesLives
Then vote NO for this unconscionable GOP healthcare bill!
PUT UPrSHUT UP! Stop the BS, save it ALL the CHC & FIX ACA...don't give crumbs & take away the loaf...1/2 mil to cut off 10s MIL...MADNESS!
Please DO NOT vote for the Cassidy-Graham healthcare bill. Please work across the aisle. You can do it.
Thank you for this, Senator. Please don't make your service into a cruel joke. Oppose the murderous Obamacare repeal. #WeAreWatching
However you will cut Medicaid funding and allow insurance companies to deny insurance to those with pre-existing conditions. Shame.
And yet you support stripping Planned Parenthood of funding?  Where do u think young women go for personal healthcare?! #clueless
#GrahamCassidyBill takes away funding from million of Missourians. Is that what you're talking about?
Vote no on #GrahamCassidy. It cuts funding to them. Either you support community healthcare or you support #GrahamCassidy it can't be both
But you can deny health coverage to people. Be a man, grow a spine & represent the people not your wallet. #fakesenator
Between fed tax, state tax, county tax, sales tax, and useless Obamacare in Missouri! I need a break! I voted for you to get things done!
Roy get that sinking ship of a program called Obamacare the heck off our backs! Get us something that don't double cost each year!
If you really care, don't tell me...SHOW ME.  Vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill
I am going to laugh my azz off if Obamacare fails and all the diehard liberals lose their health care! You can on get so far in sinking boat
If ur really interested in the well being of ur constituents, you'd vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill.It punishes ppl w/ medical vulnerabilities
This is the healthcare you think we deserve Roy?!  Your tweets are lies when compared to your support.
They need to rely on themselves and not the American taxpayers.
Can these centers give Chemo treatments or my Grandson's infusion?  How about making sure Missourians have heath care not Graham Cassidy
Wait...what? They also rely on the #ACA and #Medicaid. You have no idea what is really going on in MO, do you?
Senator, does this mean you're against the latest attempt to repeal the ACA? #GrahamCassidy
By supporting Trumpcare, you're hurting Missourians. I challenge you to use Twitter to talk with your constituents & not at them #wheresroy
You say this, then you'll turn around and vote for the abomination known as Cassidy-Graham. Incredibly hypocritical, even for you.
How you can say this with a straight face while continuing to support these awful GOP HC bills is beyond me.
This, again, is bullshit. You're prepared to vote for #GrahamCassidy which causes millions to lose HC. This isn't an important issue for you

Graham-Cassidy does not repeal Obamacare
Not going to matter if you vote for Graham/Cassidy, many of those who use Comm Health Centers won't be able to afford the insurance.
Vote NO
Thank you Senator Blunt. #fixtheclif #CHCs
If you really care about Missourian's health, vote NO on repealing the ACA.
Maybe you need to care and buy your own insurance
Talking out of both sides of your mouth Roy. You've consistently voted to take healthcare away and by supporting this new bill, same thing
NO on Graham-Cassidy. Same as the last time the GOP tried to gut the ACA. Same as the next time. No means no!
Senator: Please vote  NO on the  replu healthcare bill. It takes  all of the worst of your previous bills and combined them into one.
Your vote on #GrahamCassidyBill will show us how much you really care about Missouri.
If you vote in favor of #GrahamCassidy this appeal for funding is at best a token gesture.
Thank you @RoyBlunt for your continued support of MO's #CHCs #fixthecliff
Joe... all he has to do is vote NO on the Republican healthcare bill
They wouldn't have to close as long as you vote "NO" on the Graham and Cassidy sponsored repeal of the ACA Senator! You act as if you care.
Then why are you sponsoring the #GrahamCassidyBill ????? Do not support this bill that will rip healthcare away from Missourians.
Protect affordable healthcare for millions by voting NO on #GrahamCassidy
It's not affordable it cost me 18000 a year for my family
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy
Same goes for Planned Parenthood
With that great Obamacare you don't need planned parenthood! O that's right Obamacare sucks and needs replacing! Birth control not PPH
You have a fantastic opportunity to show us that you really care about healthcare. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
Healthcare is a disaster, drugs, chemo, surgical mutilation don't make people healthy
You're about to vote to strip healthcare from millions of people. It's insulting to watch you pretend to care about this.
Senatot Blunt Vote no
But you and your party want to take away healthcare from millions?  Do you not see the irony in your statement?
You need to work in bipartisan way to have a national health care plan
