Obamacare offers more choice than employer plans. You forgot to say that. @RoyBlunt
GOP says Obamacare limited choices, but they fail to say that most employer plans offer even more limited choice. http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/opinions/affordable-health-care-exchange-premiums-jost/ …

hey-- sorry to say as a two time Obama supporter but small biz owner the ACA is a disaster. Hurts most people.
The overwhelming vast majority of the people using ACA have a different experience.
I can give you 5 people I know very well personally who will say they hate it.
I just retweeted a dozen who love it. Sorry you hate it. Pre existing conditions are important.
basic economics and budgeting says we are paying 3x what we need to for a service.
3 years ago our employees paid $170 month to cover their entire family with a plan with zero deductible.
they now pay $940 for a plan with 2x co pay costs and a $2500 deductible. How is that "progress?"
The #aca saves my fam around $10k/yr.  It's not perfect, but it gives us options we didn't have.  You're wrong, listen to your constituents.
@Twitlertwit @RoyBlunt @YouTube It cost my family more than $5000 a,year
I agree it needs to be fixed, but it's dishonest to suggest it doesn't help anyone.
YES, NO SOCIETY CAN GROW and Prosper without affordable Health Care.
I agree.
@SenSanders @ninaturner @CornelWest @realDonaldTrump #MedicareForAll/#SinglePayer
ACA is not the final fix, but it beats what we had before. #SinglePayer #healthcareisaright
the only harm is that insurance companies are now charging more for coverage.
Obamacare saved my daughter's life. If you repeal it without replacement, I & every mother of a sick child will come after you.
Haha 48k followers and only 10 RTs. Better learn your place and vote per your bosses' orders. #TheResistance
why is it all you & your fellow mean spirited hypocrite cons do is smear? because you you really have anything of value to offer!!
They, themselves have absolutely no value whatsoever.  Except to lobbyists.
would love to hear about your "new" direction? #stillnoplan
G'ahead; sell your constituents down Lyin' Ryan's river, and see what happens next time you run.
Stabilizing the lives of millions by giving them access to vital healthcare is the opposite of wreaking havoc. @RoyBlunt
It sounds like you want my family members who have pre-existing conditions to not have insurance 
I see you've gotten a TON of retweets. (not) You're lying, and you are deceitful. It is not wreaking havoc.
it's helped me significantly as well as a million others. Just bc you say something, doesn't make it true. Proof?
and where do You stand?  Not for the needy or destitute.  Lobbyists tool who will sell anything for 
Roy is OWNED by MONSANTO....He cares nothing for humanity...Poisoning kids is his career.
Repealing Obamacare will leave me without insurance. What is your plan for the millions that rely on it?
Sir because of ACA my brother has insurance, and I'm able to see a gynecologist without paying a large  specialist copay
Many people have contacted your office about how ACA has been a lifesaver. You are dishonest in not acknowledging that. Shame!
My husband's lfe was saved, thanks to the #ACA. We could not afford a double lung transplant, anti-rejection meds.

Amber is a New Mexican w/ multiple sclerosis. Thanks to #ACA, she's able to afford $60K in prescriptions every year + MRIs & doctors visits 
Premium increases have slowed down since Obamacare was implemented. Stop misleading voters, @RoyBlunt.
Not only have premium increases gone down under Obamacare, but benefits have increased. More coverage, less cost. http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/07/21/obamacare-premiums-are-lower-than-you-think/ …

Slowed down after the mandate kicked in, but that's not really moving the cost curve. Rate of change could recover.
~ Havoc like mental health coverage? No lifetime caps? No restrictions on pre-existing conditions? #expandMedicare to all.
I'm very happy with the ACA law as it is. My family has pre-existing conditions. Please fund ACA fully.
why are the republicans are acting like big shots.  Why can't  you work with democrats on creating a better life for all Americans
Even you don't believe that, but onward...

#IAmObamacare 
What are you planning on replacing it with? Repubs have had 7 yrs to come up w an alternate plan but u only know how to obstruct!
I've many friends who would not have coverage without ACA incl a mother whose daughter's lung condition may well have killed her
Sen. Blunt. We do not agree. PPACA made big steps in medical insurance. Now we need more. But not by destroying it.
ACA coverage saved my life & helped me get health ins. for my 3 boys. Indiana's system works well & is fair. Please don't repeal!

your party cost me $3000 in COBRA premiums for my 22 yr old son til he graduated from Mizzou. I will NEVER forget or forgive!
you have no idea what you are talking about.

My wife and I are 2. ACA let her open her own music studio & me work for a non-profit. Losing it will cost one of us our dream.
Got grandkids? Better hope they were born healthy!
@JasonKander My two healthy children were both preemies; in the future their birth story could result in ins. denial; O'care is their ins!
Seems that evil ACA just encourages entrepreneurship. You should totally kill that. Bad for the economy.
I am too. Running my own business in part because getting insurance got easier to navigate.
Plenty of ministers seem to LIKE the ACA.
My wife and I would lose insurance... I am a minister and she owns her own business. Improve it, don't remove it!
Here's someone HARMED because Missoui didn't expand Medicaid. You Republicans really showed her!! https://twitter.com/chuck_lunday/status/808459013406932992 …

@PoliticsNation I have job coverage & a pre-ex condition. ACA means my life-saving meds are covered no caps. Unaffordable w/out
And, yet ANOTHER small business owner. Gosh, good thing you're going to repeal this.
Same here. ACA made it possible for me & husband to start our business.
Wow! Here's someone whose insurance PRIOR to ACA QUADRUPLED.  ACA Ins. increased only 5%!!
And my previous, non ACA insurance quadrupled from '03 to '10. Current ACA plan increased 5% in three years.
the new direction I wanted was you leaving the Senate. #Donothingsenator
Another small business owner....
including my parents - small business owners who are able to afford insurance for the 1st time in decades after ACA took effect
A small business owner who LIKES the ACA!!
ACA allowed wife and I (both had pre-existing) to quit jobs in 2012, start successful biz, and create 4 good-paying jobs.
wreaking havoc on whom? Your contributors who were able to only build a 12,000 sq. ft. beach house, or on 20 million Americans?
One of my favorite ACA plots...

not many retweets...
#WatchingBlunt Please do not repeal ACA.  Keep the best and tweak the rest. You represent all who live in Missouri.
Actually...it's not. Throwing 20million people off insurance will. Your hate for anything Obama blinds you
so are you on it? Elaborate how it's affecting you please. Or..are you just part of the party driven fascists under #Putinspuppet?

Key Facts about the Uninsured Population http://kaiserf.am/1sgeveB 
Thanks, Obamacare: America's Uninsured Rate Is Below 10% For First Time Ever via @forbes
Republicans are responsible for much of the increase in premiums. Are you purposefully deceiving voters, @RoyBlunt?
Something Republicans won't mention abt Obamacare premiums: GOP didn't hold up their end of the bargain on premium stabilization features 1/
From the get-go ObamaCare was Undermined by Republicans rejecting the Public Option which would have lowered profits
.... for Insurance Companies by way of increased competition
My son age 23, working hard at a job w/o insurance, is covered by mine because of ACA. Got a better plan? Great! Let's hear it.
The Impact of Obamacare, in Four Maps http://nyti.ms/2dUDqc4

#Obamacare saved my husband's life. TWICE. Taking away our healthcare could kill him. Not that you care (obviously)
@RVAwonk
That's roughly 1 in 6 Missourians that will be uninsured if ACA is repealed. https://twitter.com/mcbridetd/status/810854228243677184 …

@JasonKander I have coverage through the ACA because I work for a small company with 5 people. It is my only option. Small business needs it
Why not get rid of Medicare while you at it, and the VA health system, aren't they socialist programs?
#Obamacare is easy and affordable. How would you know? Try signing up with a middle class or lower class income. IT WORKS! #resist
You're either lying or misinformed. Talk to people whose lives have been saved by the ACA. Or don't you care?
of course he doesn't care! He's a Republican!
Millions of Americans hv recd healthcare via ACA. Do u plan to let trmt stop midway thru illness, cancer?Heartdisease?Black lung?
I was refused health care for years due to mild asthma, now thanks to Obamacare I'm covered. We will fight you every step of the way!
#ACA saved me, I would still be battling depression w/out meds b/c I couldn't afford them and I wouldn't have returned to work.
I will repeat myself because you people don't listen to Americans. Leave #Obamacare alone unless you have a better alternative!
.@RoyBlunt You forgot to mention that repealing ACA is a huge tax cut for the rich & a tax hike for all others.
Repealing Obamacare would give the rich a huge tax cut while reducing avg. incomes for lowest 60% of earners (http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-tax-cut-20161216-story.html …)

You're wrong. The ACA allowed me to access cheap health care and I'm terrified that you will repeal it, and I will lose coverage.
The ACA saved my life. I had a year from hell, w/ 9 hospital stays & two emergency, life-saving operations later, I am alive.
The ACA saved my life. It has been a HUGE HELP. I have consistent care for the first time in 20 years. YOU ARE DEAD WRONG.
Obamacare has been great for me
Congress has to use ACA, they want to repeal and shaft us while @WarrenDavidson proposes congress now will get special VA but not us
// Because healthcare is the privilege of the well-off & those lucky enough to have decent employer plans - RIGHT???
OUCH! Better read responses of your bosses before you vote again to repeal.
Tou all keep saying so. How about providing a detailed plan for repeal/replace? How, what, when, costs. In detail. You know-a plan
You mean like the abomination plan that was passed without being read or debated?

@RoyBlunt
GOP has had years to develop something. They produced nothing. Don't spend a dime of taxpayer money until a plan is vetted
Fantasyland.

@RoyBlunt
Accountability.
Fantasy induced hysteria over how the problem will be solved.

@RoyBlunt
On the GOP side?
Yes, I agree.
They seem to be hysterical and clueless wrt solution.
STRONGLY DISAGREE. Repeal & Replace with what EXACTLY? You aren't listening to your constituents.
the ACA is a beacon of hope for those with preexisting conditions.
. Tells me what you know. Nothing about healthcare. Obamacare has been a lifesaver for many. Dismantling it is murder
ok. Where is the republican plan?
Sir you are my Senator, and I have #Obamacare. It has helped me immensely. Please do not let it get repealed.
#WatchingBlunt Do you consider voice of your constituents? Your community is #becomingblue . Saw in recent election
make improvements, don't repeal it. #WatchingBlunt will vote accordingly. #AmericansDying4Insurance
tell me how's its wreaking havoc. Give US details. Otherwise, WE WONT VOTE FOR YOU.
he was just re-elected. He won't care for about 5 years.
504k Missourians rely on ACA. A vote against ACA is a vote against you.
imagine if republicans had put as much effort into making it work as they have criticizing it and tearing it down?! Now we all pay
STRONGLY DISAGREE
What direction would you like to go with for the ACA? Let us see what you plan to replace it with. #Obamacare
what is the new direction?  Repealing without a replacement would be the real cause of havoc...
Roy, you are irresponsible, you know that what you are saying in false, more people in your state are better off
What havoc Roy?? 22 Million people on a health care system similar to yours bother you? Reports if premium going up false
Here's some stats by a real medical expert -- who's also from Missouri. http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-charts-20170104-story.html …
It is NOT wreaking havoc , stop the lying.
NO! You are putting party over your constituents. The ACA is helping Missourians. Work to improve the ACA do not repeal.
@realDonaldTrump show us your going to stop the spending.  Address senator pauls budget reform proposal
no, I don’t. Not in the slightest.
you have no solutions to improve
NO. We need the #ACA unless you have a replacement ready. Your constituents' lives depend on it!
Can we improve the ACA? Yes. Will repeal result in needless American deaths? Yes. Listen to your constituents.
How bout you tell us the direction before we get in your car.
all the polls show ppl agree only that they want it improved.  Repeal is a losing bet, voters will remember.
this is what happens when you use fear of immigrants, islam to get supports -rnc voters don't want rnc econ policies
I strongly disagree. Obamacare is saving people's lives. Your vote will inform my vote next election.
No Sir, you and PEOTUS are wreaking havoc by trying to repeal with NO viable replacement. Listen to ur constituents
I think your president elect is wrecking havoc. Maybe focus on getting him in line before destroying the lives of decent Americans
What to do if we disagree?
ACA's not perfect, but Repeal w/o Replace sickens millions, kills thousands, and increases the deficit.
Call or email.
I call @RoyBlunt up to 3x/week. Hope he listens.
Yeah. I wonder if he may be a bit of a lost cause. Doubling down on partisan rhetoric seems to be his thing.
To everyone reading this, @RoyBlunt has made his decision to paint a partisan picture that doesn't tell the real American story. #resist.
Senator @RoyBlunt is part of the swamp that caused the #ACA to falter by not supporting and working to improve it.
what is the new direction and *how* is that direction better *exactly*?
I'd also like an answer to Henry's question.
