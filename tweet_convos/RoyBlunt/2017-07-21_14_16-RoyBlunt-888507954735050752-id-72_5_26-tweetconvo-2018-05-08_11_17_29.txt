We're too busy trying, unsuccessfully, to get you to meet with us in person.
Your call-in town hall was disgraceful.  Nobody got through on the phones, to be heard, if they weren't selected ahead of time.
And who does blunt select to talk to him on the towncalls? Only people who support & praise him. #sad
Regulations are there for a reason. They protect us from  corporations that would otherwise destroy our resources just for a profit.
Clean water, clean air, clean environment and safe working conditions are  a necessity and highly valued in Missouri
You've sold us out again and again.  How much more can you take before there is nothing left?
See Roy. It's a funny thing about Twitter? When real people's voices emerge that aren't Russian bots or Monsanto clones. You're derelict.

Activists sit in to #StopTrumpCare at @SenToomey's office @DemSpring @OurRevolution  https://www.pscp.tv/w/bDu2ejFBbVF6Z2dMWEF3S2V8MXJteFBxYXZMemRLTsESNYv9owdcQOibdKGQzCoXphiGm-bCySW9Apaw7s6I …
Same is coming for you, Senator.
I'll be there!
@RoyBlunt there must bregulations 4public&environmental safety! T keeps cancelling regulations in those areas  its ur job to keep MO safe
Does that apply to the 1st family's manufacturing business too?  Is so, why wouldn't you speak out about it?
It's against regulations.  #sad
Aren't you worried about what POTUS is doing to democracy? He should be impeached! You're on Senate Intel. Committee! Do your job!
could you be more disgusting? Not a challenge, just a legitimate question
WAKE UP, ROY!!!!  Trump is BULLDOZING EVERYTHING good about this country!!!
9 drs tell you smoking causes cancer. One Dr says he's not sure. Who do you believe? #ClimateChange #ItsReal #EducateYouselfAndOthers
need regulations to protect workers. and the environment
Let's focus on healthcare.
I'm guessing MO likes reps that don't think about legislation & its impacts before voting.
Asked if "skinny repeal" could become law or is just a way to get to conference, Sen. Roy Blunt says "I haven't thought it through."
REMEMBER HOW DEVOS PAID YOU TO VOTE YES ON HER EDUCATION CONFIRMATION.  I  DO. MISSOURI DOES. #weremember #voteoutblunt #hesacrookliketrump
Might want to tell the Trump family - they manufacture outside of the US. Hypocrites just like you.
Did you finally understand the message?  Stand up for Trump's agenda
How's your Russian? Are you taking bribes in Rubles now? Do you get your daily dose of Borscht? #TrumpRussia #TrumpCare #sad
Uh Roy, excuse me but ... do you think you might find some time to do a few town hall meetings across the State you're from? Just asking?
Marching off the cliff with #bannonstooge trump. Surprise surprise!
Made in America...how about improving the food stamp program in Missouri..people under the poverty level STILL can't qualify.
so by that you mean you will address the fact that trump and his daughter don't support "made in America" with their businesses
The regulations aren't excessive. CEO and upper management pay is though. This lie isn't gping to work much longer. Be kind.
ON THE RECORD SENATOR: Have you taken any money from Russians? 

A simple yes or no will suffice. Oh, and proof.
Medicare For All - 60% of US citizens want it. The country needs it.
We must regulate business or we will be back to the days when business will screw the workers. Look at what has happened to workers in RTWS
When are you going to have a real town hall meeting? None of this phone nonsense.
Yeah who needs regulations to protect us.  Just makes more job to fill the sick and injured..and no ACA saves us money.  Brilliant
We need to focus on removing our Pro Russian GOP congress who want to turn our ACA into a tax cut for themselves & their rich friends. SICK
Regulations save us from dying from pollution, excessive hours at low pay caused by corporate greed.
You mean things like making sure we have clean air and water? Even you need those royboy.
Let's work more on curbing Russian intervention in our government.
while not selling out the planet to corporate greed.
/7 We elected you to represent Missourians #doyourjob or it will be difficult to consider you for future employment in our government.
6/ Sir, we did not elect you to carry water for a sinking presidency, nor did we elect you to carry water for the Republican party.
/5 Instead, let's figure out how to pursue clean air and water, and help support our working Missourians at the same time.
Preposterous! Manufacturing as u c it is dead, regs don't curtail growth. We need innovation, retraining, corp leaders who protect workers.
/4 That's a short-term solution for a long-term problem. We only have one planet. We only have one Missouri. Let's not trash either one.
/3 by rolling back EPA regulations, you're saying that it's ok to poison 100% of Missourians to support the other 14%.
The company I work for struggles but its not regulations.  Its lack of money in a mature market competing against China. No regulation hoax.
/2 If that number is correct, then the number of people you cited is 14% of the population of Missouri.
1/Senator Blunt, according to https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/MO  2,442,316 people work in the state of Missouri.
And maybe focus on why GOP shot Obamacare in the head & tried to make it look like suicide
One reg that doesn't work is too many.  1000 that are simple, adaptive & cost effective at implementing common values are priceless.
How about focusing on getting the Russian traitor you hitched your wagon to out of the white house.
And end tearing down our beautiful factories https://youtu.be/yMEPwQmknlU 
For every new regulation gut 10. Could probably cut 100 & not hurt anyone except the pride of the sponsor(s).  Don't be owing to anyone!
As a taxpayer I demand action! http://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-used-obamacare-money-to-run-ads-against-it?source=twitter&via=mobile …
Deliberate sabotage by GOP and misappropriation of funds.
For sure, tell your homeboy that
You've become a virus
That has eaten up its host
We've been watching you with all of our eyes
And what you seem to value most
You mght wnt 2tell your POTUS that!   HIS products R mde OUTSIDE of America!  Tlk abt a hypocrite! Why shld a co produce here if HE Won't ?
No, what you MUST do is listen to your constituents or we send you home.  Missouri needs medical insurance, and we don't want Russians in WH
How about focus on providing healthcare so that there are people to manufacture things.  If excessive regulations means clean water I'm in
We must focus on doing what is best for people, & not just Repubs. Start w/ bipartisan fix for the ACA and end with impeaching 45
Sen @RoyBlunt ZERO HC updates n July?
Pls explain what @GOP is doing 2 improve HC as a whole n MO
#ShowMe #BetterCare
Do NOT defund Medicaid

.@realDonaldTrump is the last person who should be talking about #MadeInAmerica this week. 

Here are the questions I asked @erictrump and others at @trump Org. About plan to hire foreign workers at Mar-a-Lago. No answer yet. 

Happening right outside @ChrisVanHollen office in Hart building, just now! #KillTheBill #medicare4all 
And make the Trump family produce their product in the United States why are they any better than any other American company

Right now we're busy focusing on keeping our health care. Did you find that campaign promise you made that said you wanted to take Medicaid
From all Missourians? How about the one to end Medicare? Funny I can't find them either.

When are you going to focus on your constituents back here in MO? You remember that state? Here let me show you.....
What are "excessive regulations?"

“We should repeal and replace, and we shouldn’t leave town until this is complete.”

Save the tape for this weekend. http://nbcnews.to/2ref17Z  
You should REPEAL trump!  Replace with HILLARY who he stole the POTUS from!
