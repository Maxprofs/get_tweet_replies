If you care about the #Orlando victims, you'll stand up to the @NRA & stop taking their $$ @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan
your condolence don't mean spit. What have YOU done to help the LGBT community?    Yeah, that's what I thought.
actions speak louder than tweets, will you be returning the $60,550 sent your way by the @NRA over the years?
Did the $60k in #NRA money make it easier for you to mourn, @RoyBlunt? #NRAPuppet #Orlando
As elected official who's long been owned by @NRA, you're accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Worth the price of your soul?
But why, then, do you accept money from the NRA?
I can list the amount of money you have received from the NRA. But again, that is as good as your "condolences." #iscreamforchange
ThoughtsAndPrayers aren't enough Give back the thousands you have taken from NRA & DO something about gun violence igorvolsky
every single mass shooting has been in places with anti gun laws. every. single. one. think about that.
All the guns used in latest attack were purchased legally. But go ahead & continue to claim gun control laws aren't needed.
also, they aren't needed. Laws only stop the lawful. He was set on killing so he broke the law.
laws like that would have prevented the Orlando shooter from buying his AR-15 legally & wouldn't restrict gun lovers like you
laws like what? Profiling laws?
.@RoyBlunt no mention of #CommonSenseGunLaws - looks like the @NRA's $60,550 in donations was money well spent #Orlando
maybe instead of offering condolences, actually do something to prevent gun-related deaths?
DO YOUR JOB!!! enough is enough already
And we congratulate you on becoming the Number 1 recipient of NRA cash, which surely enhances your "mourning."
@RoyBlunt
cc @igorvolsky
keep your condolences. Their blood is one your hands but take this time to correct you vote on HR 1076, stand with @ChrisMurphyCT
.@RoyBlunt If you see victims in #Orlando as innocent, why do you oppose all efforts to stop crimes against #LGBT in our own state of #MO?
your condolences mean nothing when you have continuously voted to continue discriminating the LGBT+ community.
I can list your voting record on LGBT and Gun Rights issues but that is as good as your "condolences." #iscreamforchange
Please stop these senseless acts! Vote FOR gun laws and keep these deadly weapons out of our public places!
Every single mass shooting has occurred in places with gun laws. every. single. one. Use common sense, I beg you.
you "beg"? How many of your friends and family have been threatened in acts like this? I've lived through it!
You completely ignored my main point. Good job. gun laws = mass shootings
tell that to Australia.  Tell that to Sandy Hook, and tell that to the 50 people who died with ARMED guards
sandy hook was in a GUN FREE ZONE the night club was a GUN FREE ZONE. Gee logic is fleeting with you.
you only got 60k from the NRA? I would have thought completely ignoring thousands of gun deaths would be worth at least 6 figures.
then why don't you return the money you have taken from the NRA and actually DO something about terrorists getting military guns?
Condolences are fine, but it is your job to do something! I'm your constituent, and I support the #filibuster
.@RoyBlunt This:
Your actions don't match your words. You block bills that would stop criminals from buying guns then shed fake tears when ppl die.
keep them u hypocrite. Enact meaningful gun reform now to try to was away the $1.4 M of #NRABloodMoney from your hands #Enough
Your condolences mean less than nothing. Get off NRA teat and help pass sensible gun control.
No you don't. You take NRA $$$ + You continue to contribute to the victimization of the GLBT community. DO SOMETHING about that..
Maybe some of the money the @NRA gave you could be put to good use curbing gun violence, instead of empty rhetoric and inaction.
.@RoyBlunt If only there was a way to keep guns out of the hands of men like this... #ohwait #gladyourprioritiesrinorder #thatsweetNRAmoney
Condolences? Shame on you for voting NO to #CommonSenseGunLaws. How many more incidents till u vote YES?
how much $$$ do you get from the NRA?
does it matter? pretty sure this MUSLIM wasn't apart of the NRA.
It does matter, because the GOP allows terrorists to easily purchase guns.
you advocate taking the horns from an antelope because lions have claws. good logic.
Hope that @NRA money buys you a conscious
Conscience. The word is conscience. The NRA isn't evil. Islam is.
@RoyBlunt
@RoyBlunt
Vote to keep guns from terrorists and give back that boatload of cash from the NRA
Fuck all of the morons. They don't understand common sense anyways. They act like they'd turn down 800g's. hypocritical assholes.
you take money from people supplying guns to terrorists. your 'mourning' is meaningless and empty. your condolences are poisoned.
No he doesn't. Look up operation fast and furious. That was the liberals sweetheart.

@MSNBC Google search what a runner is. Then google search operation fast and furious, inherent resolve
F*#k your prayers. Not enough. Blood on your hands.
stop with the empty platitudes. Enjoy the remainder of your term. Missourians will NOT re-elect you.
yeah, thanks for the condolences instead of action against gun violence or a stop to the anti LGBT rhetoric from you conservatives
you voted against the 2009 law that classifies this as a hate crime.
keep cashing those #NRA checks and making empty statements.   Shame on you. #Orlando @MomsDemand
how about getting off NRA's tit and do something about this? Eh, nevermind @JasonKander will take care of it for you.
Hypocrite. Owned by the NRA. Blood is on your hands. #guncontrolnow #shameonyou
Your inaction led to these deaths.  #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
maybe do something about it then. Thoughts and prayers aren't enough. Support the majority of Americans who want gun reform.
Condolences are meaningless if YOU do not take steps to ban assault weapons. Condolences don't stop bullets
Your condolences? As an elected official who does the bidding of the @NRA, you are an accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando.
But did you congratulate @realDonaldTrump ? #Priorities
Hmm, condolences but no prayers.  Not hypocritical then. Prayers are empty words unless you take responsibility. Guns=idols.
Do your job and enact real gun control or take your condolences and shove them.
Now join MAJORITY of Americans 2 ban military grade weaponry& repeal Protection of Lawful Commerce Arms Acts.Action vs words
"I'd further like to state that IT IS THE BANKSTERS&BIS that continue 2 Taunt My Missourians w/Mass Staged Shootings 4 their blood
$755,816 from NRA. Blood on your hands.
Condolences are cheap. Show real courage and propose #BradyLaw2Now.
nice try you hypocrite! You take $$ from the devil.
Your sympathy means nothing if you won't ACT and #VoteForGunControl #InnocentLivesMatter #OrlandoNightclubShooting
I’m sure that greatly eases their pain.
.@RoyBlunt how does that $800k you got from the NRA feel right now?
Stop advocating for the NRA and enact #GunControl legislation. Your prayers are hypocrisy. Stop supporting the gun insanity.
Don't need condolences Senator. We need action. Please stop being bought off by the NRA and help people.
You've lost the privilege of joining  families in mourning because you are one of the biggest recipients of NRA funds in Congress.
Not while you're still taking wads of cash from the @NRA to ensure this keeps happening... #lawsnotprayers #DoYourJob
$756,000 from the NRA & only condolences? More blood money.
You should be at Pulse cleaning up the blood!
#nrawhores
, come November we won't forget the money you've received from the NRA & your refusal to support common sense gun legislation.
Blood is on your hands and the hands of every Senator who voted against keeping guns from terrorists.  #bluntbloodmoney
take a real stand, your condolences mean nothing if you continue to be bought by the NRA!
accepted over $750K from the NRA
The dead don't want your mourning and condolences
#Hypocrite
Then why vote angst banning weapon purchases by people on the no fly list?!
time to reevaluate your relationship with the NRA
you're going to do what to help future victims? Prayers aren't working. Don't you get tired of this tweet????
oh, good. Thoughts and prayers. That'll fix it!
You are a bloody sucking ghoul that loves the money and hates the LGBTQ. Thug.
if you REALLY cared, you'd take action.  But you love NRA money more.  How sad.
140 characters for salvation. Your life must be easy.
How about offering something other than empty words. #BanAssaultWeapons #BetterBackgroundChecks
When you taken that much $ from the @NRA we know your agenda.Your words are empty & insulting to those hurting today. #gunsense
As you "mourn" you can drink a pricey scotch paid for by the NRA. DO something. They are KILLING us. #everytownforgunsafety
Does that NRA money feel like guilt now?  I condemn your actions.
got $755,816 from @NRA 
Blunt is the GOP senator from my state. I have never voted for him. Never will.  #OrlandoShooting
shut up
You didn't care enough to vote for background checks in December.
My thoughts & prayers are with @RoyBlunt  & the other 49 Senators who voted NO on closing the terror gap on gun purchases. @NRA
how hard is it to count your NRA money when they’re soaked in blood? Your words are hollow
But not acce
please pass common sense gun reforms supported by majority of voters.
what are you going to do to prevent this from happening again? #guns
That's great, but what about doing something to help prevent it in the future?
.@RoyBlunt, your condolences would mean more if you hadn't voted 100% of the time with anti-LGBTQ @FRCdc
@laureldavilacpa @RoyBlunt @FRCdc Or voted with @nra 100%
Give the nearly $800,000 you got from the NRA to the families.
Thoughts and Prayers are NOT enough.
HYPOCRITE.....u take $$ from the @NRA so stop your bullshit
$755,816 from the NRA in case you forgot who holds your leash
Your condolences mean nothing, you NRA lackey.

.@RoyBlunt got $755,816 from @NRA so all you get are his "condolences." Unfortunately that wont stop mass shootings  https://twitter.com/RoyBlunt/status/742048753243262976 …
Shame on you for voting against banning no-fly list from purchasing weapons. You and the @NRA have blood on your hands.
quit taking NRA $ and do something to prevent future tragedies. You know...#DoYourJob. Until then just stop talking.
@KrisKetzKMBC Do just pray about it. Do something about it. Gun laws need changing NOW.
Send the $755k you received from the @NRA down to the families in #Orlando who lost loved ones in the #PulseShooting.
Empty words Senator.  You blocked common sense legislation on gun control.  This MO gun owner will vote against you asap.
I'm sure you can dry your tears with the $750k the NRA gave you. You helped make this tragedy happen. Blood is on your hands.

$755,816 from @NRA
how about you condemn the NRA by wanting to put guns on everyone's hands?
your condolences are worthless, mealy mouthed platitudes. Stop taking NRA bribes and help advocate for gun safety. Find some balls
You're part of this tragedy supporting the NRA
I understand that you have received over $700,000 from the NRA. That makes you a fucking hypocrite.
Their loved ones are gay. You know, the people you advocate discrimination against.
If you really cared you would stand up to the NRA, ban assault rifles, & work towards common sense gun laws.
U also join your GOP comrades in being useless as tits on a bull when it comes to our gun violence problem bc you're in bed w/NRA
thank you. Now join us in getting assault weapons off the market and out of circulation. Stand up to the NRA. Stop the killing.
great sentiment Roy, Call @realDonaldTrump and ask him to show a little class on this very sorrowful day - Trump is being crude.
Don't pray. Do something. Prevent it from happening again
DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT
will you vote for bill banning assault weapons for those on FBI watch list?
No one wants your thoughts and prayers when you make money off these shootings. We need action and to elect someone to take it.
Condolences are NOT ENOUGH! #VoteBluntOut #Missouri
Islamic terrorists. 2a
why don't you do more than pray Senator Blunt? Why don't you support gun control laws that will actually prevent mass shootings?
you take over 755k from NRA, we need gun control not prayers #GunWhore
- you are part of the problem, you @NRA shill.
Maybe give back NRA money, vote for background checks, assault rifle ban and ban sales to those on the watch list.  Till then, FU.
In lieu of condolences, maybe some action against gun violence. Go ahead, take a chance.
you hypocrite! Reject NRA and pass some common sense gun control!
try doing something about it
.@RoyBlunt You're one of the worst of the worst of the corrupted politicians in Washington. I can barely wait for your defeat in November.
Would that the NRA was only giving you "thoughts and prayers" rather than campaign contributions?
fucking hypocrite pretending to give a shit sit the fuck down
The sound of your cash register rings  louder than prayers to your Demotic Dollar God! #GOPHypocrite
You got paid more NRA hush money than I've made in 20 years.  Keep your so called thoughts to yourself,  you've done enough.
condolences? Offer to support a ban AK-15 ownership. How needs them except assholes intent on murder
This tweet funded by the NRA. There's blood on your hands, Senator. What action will you take to prevent future rampages?
As a MO voter, let me say fuck your lip service. Give back your NRA blood money, and leave public life. You are an embarrassment.
.@RoyBlunt Your condolences mean nothing. By taking NRA money & voting against sensible gun control, you're complicit in #Orlando slaughter.
$755k worth of condolences?
$$$ from NRA.
we will vote out all #GunGovernors
DO SOMETHING to stop this madness. NEVER vote against background checks again! Do you have the courage to stand up to the NRA?!
how does it make you feel to get an immense amount of backlash?? You're in a position to make a difference and you CHOOSE not 2,
You should've resigned after 6 year olds were slaughtered in Newton.  AR-15s have no place on our streets!  DO YOUR FUCKING JOB!!
fucking talking head for @NRA
He was on the No Fly list but could still legally buy a gun because of you and your patrons at the NRA.
How did you vote regarding background checks and assault weapon bans? How much $$ support have you received from the NRA?
condolences mean nothing from someone who could have stopped this & many other murders with common sense gun policies. #SHAMEONYOU
Do you just copy and paste this shitty tweet every time there's a shooting?
But not enough to ban assault weapons. #NRAPuppet
Their blood on your hands as you allow guns to get into the hands of terrorists, your "mourning" means nothing
Condolences are sweet. A vote to ban assault weapons would've been far more meaningful, a-hole #complicit http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes …
Shame NRA  clown
maybe pass a law outlawing ALL assault rifles ... AT LEAST !!! prayers don't save lives ! blood is on your hands
I would imagine the families don't want your condolences. They want action. Stop the madness.
@RoyBlunt
You're a hypocrite.
when you're done mourning will you donate that $700K to the families of #OrlandoNightclubShooting ? #ThoughtsAndPrayers
@RoyBlunt
Don't waste our time with platitudes, MR. SENATOR.  Vote for laws that promote tolerance and kindness.
