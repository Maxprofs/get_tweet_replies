You have failed us AGAIN Our civil liberties should not be sold to the highest bidder We will not forget #Election2018
blunt received over 185,000$ to sell our internet history
He also received money from Devos to deny education to the children in his district. He is a plight on MO
thanks did not know that.  how did he get reelected?
he wants investagion into russia stopped- is he in on it
doubt it. Too many people just vote a straight ticket without even knowing what they are voting for
he's for big business and against women and the little people Ol Roy.
blunt received  over $185,000 to sell our internet history
it's always about the $, right Ol Roy?
No tweets about your opposition to funding border security wall?  That is Trumps #1 objective. The establishment will be drained.
he also took over$185,000 to sell our internet history
not to mention the lack of town halls that people are asking and even petitioning for.
blunt received over $185,000 to sell our internet history
Wow, sold for pretty cheap considering the revenue big business stands to earn from it. What a shame.
Qualified? Hahahahahaha!
That's not good enough. Compare/contrast w/#MerrickGarland. What makes #Gorsuch more qualified/worthy of @SenateGOP vote?
Because he voted in favor of big bizness & against the person...time aft time. GOP'ers luuuuuv that!
Well, as long as we're only interested in Party politics on the bench, I take it all back. </sarcasm>
I have tons of doubt. He appears to be anti-woman and anti-labor.
anti-labor is a policy/political stance (and that's fine). Anti-woman is a fake news story created to manipulate you
just as Sessions, Flynn, DeVoss and Trump are qualified in your eyes? Your endorsment is bought #InvestigateTrump
yes thank you Senator Blunt. Good deal
As your constituent, I oppose. No Justice should be appointed during the current investigation.
he ruled in favor of a corp over a man freezing to death. A constitutionalist would choose life over a misdirected regulation.
The nominee is supposed to be transparent, be able to back his nomination. Not just refuse to answer.
it was have been nice for you to give Merrick Garland the same chance to testify, Roy.
Should be put on hold until @POTUS FBI criminal investigations are complete.   #LiesMatter
@mosnowflake YUP! Roy $old out constits privacy http://bit.ly/2nzXTWK  for $185,000 in last campaign #HJRes86 #NoGorsuch
thank you for this article!
We all know that Gorsuch and Sessions were handpicked by Manafort to protect Trump.  Senator, where do you pledge your allegiance?
It's very obvious good ole boy Roy pledges his alliegence to Russia, Trump and Party... in that order!  As do ALL GOP!
and Garland wasn't? You wouldn't even give him a hearing.
you sold us out for $183K. You aren't qualified to tell me my interest Mr. Blunt
Garland is the nominee. you did not allow him to be nominated. why should Gorsuch? never
how about the fact that he ruled against a man trying to save himself from freezing to death  #heartless
Don't tru$t men w/NO integrity. @RoyBlunt $old out constits privacy http://bit.ly/2nzXTWK  for$185,000 in last campaign #HJRes86 #NoGorsuch
blunt received over 185,000 $ in contributions to sell our internet history!!
Blunts loyalties aren't with his voters, that's for sure.
How so, he didn't even answer. It doesn't even matter Rep vs Dem this isn't common sense.
you're supposed 2represent me; 64015. The majority of informed citizens from MO disagree w you & @POTUS #IndependentInvestigation
then why doesnt he answer question?    this leaves lots of doubt did he ever tell from where he got 10 million dollar gift?
wonder what judge Garlands would show? #bluntexposed
I can't believe your stand on the wall. U should be ashamed. I wish I had voted different in primary. I will next time.
oh there's plenty of doubt like #TrumpRussiaCollusion NO lifetime appts #IndependentCommission use some damn common sense @GOP
he's more qualified than the judge you refused to review last year?! Or of a political belief you like & that kind of "qualified"
being qualified requires a sense of right & wrong based on a moral compass to be used to interpret the law. missing this quality.
you stole Garland seat
Too bad that you never had a chance to hear Merrick Garland testify. And now you are afraid to face your constituents.  Hypocrite!
YOU ALL DAMN WELL BETTER FUND #BuildTheWall NOW! CUT SPENDING ON ILLEGAL ALIENS, REFUGEES & FOREIGN AID! #AmericaFirst NOW!  NOW!
Belongs to Merrick Garland. Why didn't you force a vote then? We the people overwhelmingly voted for #obama.
Per Mitch MConnell, you should not vote on a judge appointed by a President who (likely) has less than a year left to serve.
It left a lot of doubt. What's not in doubt is your unwillingness to listen to your constituents.
Not his turn. Please advise & consent on Garland first per the Constitution. Garland is also a good judge. Older & more centrist.
this is a stollen seat by a tainted president
Can you share a video of why Garland was not qualified to even get a vote? Hold a town hall to hear your constituent's input.
- I must have saw a completely different testimony than you. He wouldn't even answer a simple yes/no question. Wake up roy!
what is different about him than Merrick Garland other than the party who nominated them?
in the stolen SCOTUS seat
Merrick Garland
Obama's pick was just as qualified and you denied him to be petty.
@GOP You might believe you are fooling @POTUS but you aren't fooling us! Repeal O'care NOW and fund Border Wall NOW! Keep your promises!
Picking candies offered by @POTUS but refusing to help with his agenda? Then what do you call yourself?
Qualified by whos standards?
Merrick Garland was qualified. Why didn't he get a hearing?
I'm certain he's qualified, too! But I fully support blocking his nomination until the investigation into @realDonaldTrump is done
Since you held the seat open for a year, you can keep it open until #Trump is cleared of wrongdoing. #usefulidiot
his ruling/explanation on IDEA funding for SpEd children should give you much to doubt
Merrick Garland
Biden Rule.
No he's not.
bite me rich old white man your days in power are numbered.
let's talk about it after the investigations are complete.
If u would have had hearings for Fealand I'm guessing u would have come to the same conclusion, but u didn't. Clear obstruction
Garland going to fast
qualifications didn't matter when GOP didn't even grant a more qualified Garland the courtesy of a hearing. Tired of partisan BS.
1. He never answered any question, so lots of doubt.
2. There shouldn't be an opening b/c Garland was nominated.
#Hypocrite
convince @clairecmc to say YES to Gorsuch.
He's not a legitimate nominee. He's a Bannon/Mercer choice. If you do nothing else vote no.
Gorsuchs qualifications r irrelevant
If u can justify holdng a stolen #SCOTUS seat open a yr, u can hold it while FBI investigates @RoyBlunt
and so was #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland 
Merrick Garland was even more qualified, but that didn't matter to you then. Your position on Gorsuch = breathtaking hypocrisy.
stop living in the past
#NoToGorsuch! No judge until #Trumprussia investigation is complete!
Nonsense, you guys keep making up that crap it will go on forever. Farkas admitted today she spied on Trump.Watergatesque
No nomination while @POTUS is under investigation.
maybe he'll vote to not allow isp's to sell our personal information.  Maybe one of those isp's can get trumps tax returns.
yeah yeah so was Garland Mitch McConnell is a liar and Thief
.@RoyBlunt your constant tweeting about him leaves no doubt you don't care he was appointed by an administration under federal investigation
Can you guarantee he will be independent, unlike Devin Nunes, because the Judicial is the last check, balance and branch we have.
