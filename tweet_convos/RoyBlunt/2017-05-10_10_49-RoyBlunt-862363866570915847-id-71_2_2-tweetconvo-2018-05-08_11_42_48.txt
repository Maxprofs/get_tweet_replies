The perfect chance to publicly demand a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump administration's ties to Russia.
Can't have a Special Prosecutor, because that law expired years ago. But no need because there's NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. #FBIDirector
AG or Deputy AG could. And there's plenty to suggest an investigation into the campaign & Trump's team is needed.
Please, enlighten us. Please name the evidence that your liberal congressmen can't seem to.
Troll someone else. You're tedious AF.
Time for a special prosecutor and independent investigation. Our very democracy is at stake. Get a spine. #impeachment #traitors #beholden

#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! #UnitedforFreedom! STAND for FREEDOM not socialism!
Republican Representatives are trampling on free speech and free press at town halls is that okay with you?
Hey troll Phyllis, don't you have anything better to do?  NPR is calling.
Nah I like Roy better, but thanks for your concern I was missing something good on NP

Hey, Roy. Are you all still on the Trump Train?  I sure would like to know. I remember seeing you smilin' behind him.
Talk about the 24 MILLION you Republicans plan to TAKE HEALTHCARE FROM--& 5TIMES COST TO 50+yr olds--w/TrumpScare. COWARD+GREED=U
#COVERUP #COMPLICIT
Are you going to ask the senate for an independent investigation into the Trump and Russia?
#FullRepeal of obamacare every root and branch as promised!
only if replaced w better!!!!! help old and sick.  that is our duty. even AARP against new bill
Federal gov't has no Constitutional role in healthcare - let free enterprise work! 
#Constitution #Liberty #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
It is high time the G O P step it up and stop trying to push their version of big government healthcare. #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
You voted to repeal a regulation that limits methane emissions into the air from oil & gas drilling? Voted for oil companies & dirty air?!
Or talk about Missourians that will be banned from good affordable healthcare so Trumpcare aka: Tax Break for the Rich can destroy the sick?
Will you discuss why you think we don't need National Monuments and Parks?
Are you still blindly supporting a man that lies, abuses women, bullies?
Unless u r talking about a #FullRepeal of Obamacare Im not listening. Do the rite thing & get the govt out of healthcare #UnitedForFreedom
#FULLREPEAL #UNITEDFORFREEDOM #KEEPYOURPROMISE Government hands off of our healthcare.
Will you please go on and promise not to take healthcare from millions of people? If you're pro-life, you'll ensure healthcare for all.
Why will you spend time on conservative radio stations but you won't talk directly with your constituents?
You little weasel!! We see you, Roy - and it isn't pretty. Traitor!
Proud (I) Missourian wants ind. investigation into Russian election interference. Like all proud Missourians, "Show Me" nothing is there
Do your job!! Assign an independent investigator on trump Russia. We are watching you. Country before party
can't u see 45 is a nightmare??  Speak up!  Help our country be rid of this treasonous, awful, bully 45.
We need a #SpecialProsecutor & an #IndependentInvestigation into #TrumpRussia. #Americans deserve to know the truth! #DoYourJob!
What right will you not protect next, maybe the right to own guns? Russia has strict gun ownership are we going there?
Republican Representative Ann Wagner called her (your) constituents Radical Leftists is that okay with you?
How about you tune into your constituents and have a real town hall?
Of course we need a special prosecutor and an independent investigation. Examine your conscience, senator, and put country over party.
How about holding some town hall meetings instead? Why won't you actually meet with your constituents?
America first! Country over party. We must not let our democracy be put in the hands of Russian invaders.
Are you going to talk about the need for a special prosecutor or independent investigation? Or just tow that party line?
Hi @MarcCox871 & @971FMTalk Please ask @RoyBlunt why his office is not responding to constituent calls, emails. Not even staff replies. Thks
The Russians have occupied our White House, and they're laughing at us.  #Shame
Our national security is at stake. We need an independent investigation of Trump-Russia.

You could at least choose to speak on a medium where you might reach the other half of your constituents.
Former NatSec Advisor to VP Biden has a question...
Like the Keystone cops. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-to-meet-russian-foreign-minister-at-the-white-house-as-moscows-alleged-election-interference-is-back-in-spotlight/2017/05/10/c6717e4c-34f3-11e7-b412-62beef8121f7_story.html …
We need an independent investigation and your "friend" sessions needs to remain out of the director selection
I hope you'll be calling for a special investigation of Russian meddling!
You must demand a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump/Russia scandal.
Are you going to address the firing of Comey and ask for an independent prosecutor? Ask the hard questions @MarcCox971
Please speak out about Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Denial of facts and evidence makes all of Missouri look stupid.
you're a coward.  meet face-to-face with your constituents.  explain your decisions and how they affect people in MO.
yes, Roy, it s past time to listen to us. 63017
Step up for your constituents, the Show Me State and request an Independent Counsel to investigate Trump/Russia. Show us what UR made of!
Is your fax machine working again?
Are you going to call for a special prosecutor into Trump's ties to Russia?
