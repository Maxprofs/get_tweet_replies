Yes!!! Our utility bills need to be reduced. Thank you for discussing this.
U SOLD OUT MO. ENVIRONMENT TO FARMERS ALLOWING UNREGULATED POLLUTANTS FROM LIVESTOCK& FOOD PRODUCTION INTO THE ENVIRONMENT!
UR VOTE FOR PRUITT ALLOWS UNREGULATED POLLUTION BY COMPANIES, FARMING,INTO THE AIR,GROUND,RIVERS,LAKES STREAMS & OCEANS!
you're right, breathable air and drinkable water are way overrated anyway. But greed, well that's forever.
I would love to discuss the waters of the United States and the impact on Missourians at your next town hall meeting. #townhall
.@RoyBlunt If you are not willing to extend the debate in order to know the viability of the candidate, your motives are suspect.
All of the Republicans' motives are suspect at this point. The greed and self interest is appalling. All need to go!
I am shocked, honestly. I had hoped that principled Republicans would have jumped ship by now. It's been an eye-opener
#retireRoy
Retire Senator Roy Blunt http://petitions.moveon.org/s/tUcQi3  @moveon @RoyBlunt @RoyBluntMO #Missouri #MizzouMade #Mizzou #TrumpPressConference #MAGA
ooooookay. This Missourian is watching.
Many jobs of the future will be in clean, renewable energy. Protecting the environment can bring jobs and money to Missouri!
Interesting, I don't see a single comment supporting you or @scottpruitOK. Oh. Cause everyone hates you both. Silly me. 
You're old so don't care, but our grandchildren will live in a horrible environment. Shame on you. #climatechange
Seriously? Are you serious right now?
You should hold a town hall in STL. We want to talk to you.
FINALLY! I'll be able to dump raw sewage and industrial waste in our beautiful clean streams
Not looking forward to water being polluted.... emails/pruitt/what are you thinking?  How about coming to MO and talking about it?
Boo.  You are bad and you should feel bad!
Probably because you're state can't handle it themselves. That's usually the case. Good luck when the EPA isn't there to help.
This will do nothing but cause  many to get sick, or sicker as the case may be.
"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.  It's not."  Read The Lorax.  Town hall soon?
you are destroying us
when are you coming home for a town hall?
Listen to your constituents. Vote no on Pruitt.
He is SO over his constituents. He does not even care one damn bit.
he cares where the money comes from though
@travisfitzwater USGS ranks MO in top 4 leading state contributors of nutrient pollution-2nd for phosphorous and 4th for nitrogen
NO ON PRUITT!!  But then again.. you don't listen to your constituents do you Roy???  When is that town hall going to be?
So you're responsible for telling MO families to be content w/ poisoned air/water b/c corporations' bottom line 'trumps' safety?
EPA should have control over 100% of MO & USA. It's called Environmental Protection Agy & should b regs 2 keep biz from polluting
after not requiring oil companies to report bribes to foreigh gov, now you prob want them to not have to report spills. #NoDAPL
you look forward to working with him because you are as corrupt as he is
once again u r party over country and thats a fact
Should we start preparing for EArthquakes in MO? Scott Pruitt seems to enjoy them!
Your refusal to break with the Republicans and think independently as to what's best for Missouri is embarrassing.
What have you unleashed on future generations? Where are the true patriots in this country? Not in the Republican Party.
Please don't take away protections that safeguard our health.

SERIOUSLY?! What is wrong with you, Roy? The EPA protections are vital to MO. Get your head out and vote #NoOnPruitt. #RecallBlunt
Who needs clean water? Also what about the effects of climate change on agriculture in our state if you roll back EPA regs?
yeah protecting the environment for future generations isn't as important as making money. Screw trees and clean water.
Shame on you.  We will not forget.
I'd like my grandchildren to have clean air to breathe and water to drink
hey my senator!  Do something about Rouge CIA And help POTUS.
.@RoyBlunt Could you please explain what is so bad about rules against polluting water?
Vote NO #RepMOrRecallBlunt
F*cking worst nominee possible for this post.   What's in the emails?  Coward!   Travesty!
DO NOT vote to confirm this person.  He will allow out beautiful state to be destroyed.
when a corn farmers dump industrial nitrogen on their land that still makes its way into the water system Hence toxic alge blooms
the EPA should have the right to regulate pollutants that  concentrate in our river systems through streams.
Yeah, it's so hard for rich people to make money when they can't poison the poor and middle classes. WE WANT CLEAN WATER!
St Louis has serious environmental issues including a radioactive landfill A strong @EPA will help protect citizens. NO on #Pruitt
"climate change" was invented by Al Gore as a get rich scheme. It worked. So sad
...absent EPA/regs, pollution cases tie up the courts - after ppl get sick. This is YOUR water too.  Remember #Cuyahoga
NO on Pruitt until we can see his email. Also, independent investigation of Trump-Russia is needed NOW!!!
I fail to understand your objection to clean water/air. It's not in farm/industry's $$ interest to clean up after themselves...
please oppose. Pruitt does not believe in science!  #NoToPruitt
appears you're in everyone's pocket. VOTE NO ON PRUITT. #cantwaittovoteyouout
Senator please pay attention to Trumps campaign promises and how he is producing results to those promises.. have not seen that
Pruitt has too many conflicts of interest and too strong of ties to fossil fuel industry. You need to vote no on his confirmation.
Don't you want to see those  emails before you vote? I think there might be some important stuff in there. Or do you not care?
Yeah, because clean air and water are SO over-rated. *Cough!*
Very sad that once again you are not listening to the people you are representing.  Sad day for Missouri and America.  RIP EPA!
That's their job. Do you want your grandkids to grow up in the apocalypse or something?
You are looking forward to deregulation and bad water and crappy air? Wow, senator, you never cease to amaze me. TOWN HALL!
.@RoyBlunt  Pruitt is the worst possible choice for head of EPA. Bad decision on your part.
Remember Times Beach, MO? Look it up. You need to protect the PEOPLE not the corps who pollute. Pruitt wants to destroy the EPA.
Roy-great point!!!!
How much are you getting out of this deal?
Yes, "overreaching regulations" that ensure clean water & clean air for all Americans. You are anti-clean water & anti-clean air.
And frankly anti-Missouri and anti-American based on his actions. Sad.
nothing like an unethical polluter who cares nothing for the environment we leave our kids to work with at EPA. Good job monster
poor Missouri
@AltYelloNatPark @AltNatParkSer @altNOAA  No no  don't do it.  Don't gut the EPA.  we want clean air, water, earth.  STOP it!
Shouldn't you guys be reviewing his emails? Like...have 14 investigations or something? Or stand up to the PotUS at all?
NO NO NO.   The EPA protects the environment.   the air. the water. the wildlife, the trees.  NO NO NO.   No to Pruitt!
does the westlake landfill ring a bell?   Maybe you should look into that. #toxicMo
@realDonaldTrump please help us people are sick and dying in St. Louis
Hint: It's called the Environmental PROTECTION Agency, not the Environmental Exploitation Agency. Pruitt is a terrible choice.
Nooooooooo. This is so wrong. He going to lose this position in no time.
EPA staffers are BEGGING senators to not confirm Pruitt because of his horrible views on environmental protections.
because "over-regulation" is so much more salient than children with lead poisoning. Your support of Pruitt is abominable.
Montana is a beautiful state. Protect for the future, vote no on Pruitt
vote NO on Pruitt! As a mother and Grandmother, I fear climate change. you should care about the world you leave to your children!
.@RoyBlunt, no to Pruitt! The EPA protects your constituents from poisoning by greedy companies that will destroy our land.
Disagree. EPA protects our Missouri land and all US for future generations. Respectfully request STOP Pruitt. 
please keep our environment clean and safe for our grandchildren. Look beyond the quick buck and protect the future.
are you sure that is best? Missouri wants its Missouri and Mississippi Rivers to be clean.
Pruitt would be BAD for MO and the rest of the country. How do you face those grandkids of yours?
Literally the only thing you guys say is that he's against "overreach". You guys never mention any work for the environment he... @RoyBlunt
...has done, which leads me to assume that he hasn't done any. 
You want less regulations? Fine. But get someone who actually...

@RoyBlunt
...and clearly cares for the environment to run the EPA, or at least one that isn't under court order to release a ton of emails. @RoyBlunt
Emails that, in all likelihood, show a clear conflict of interest. @RoyBlunt
Pruitt is terrible for the environment.  He's a sellout to the oil and gas industry, and if you support him, so are you.
good to see you show your true self. Glad to know you dont care about Mo children and now Mo water and air
Roy, ru you going to wait for the court order @ScottPruittOK to release his emails?...won't hold my breath 4 response or town hall
We need to see his ties with big oil and why bother you all want to end the EPA.  We should lead the world in climate change.
.@RoyBlunt Respectfully, Sir, clean water is not overreach. Our grandchildren will be harsh judges of the decisions we make today.
come on. They are the worst! They want to dismantle the agencies they are up for.
# Only MO knows what MO needs..stay away EPA!!! Do not overstep your boundaries.. collaboration is ok but not being ruled by Feds
So w/Pruitt & Blunt we'll switch to the fossil fuel industry telling MO what MO needs.
# if it creates jobs and it helps people be self supporting- by all means YES!! YES to less Governmental REGULATION.
If jobs are something you want, building infrastructure for renewables is good for jobs, MO, & planet.  Win, win
As your constituent - NO to Pruitt. And wait for release of emails before hearings is a MUST. Please represent us in MO.
How can U be a rational person & support climate change denier w/conflicts of interest in the fossil fuel industry?
Shame on you
So you don't think his very clear conflict of interest should be scrutinized? We'll remember that. You supported Flynn too.
You know, until you didn't anymore. Did someone threaten to pull donations or do you actually have a heart in there somewhere?
he replaced his heart with an automatic change sorting machine. The clinking sounds really get him going.
remember that @RoyBlunt gets his salary from our #Taxdollars! Why r we paying taxes 4 this treatment & corruption
Because Missouri doesn't allow for state officials to be recalled. Of course @RoyBlunt doesn't care about us!
Hand over 28% of my income so Melanoma can stay in golden cage tower? So DJT can rally?
Do what is right for the environment! Protect beautiful Missouri!
You act like that's a bad thing.  Keep voting Yes to dump waste into our water you sell out.
and YOU will own the destruction that he wrecks on our Earth. WE will hold YOU accountable!
why don't you come back to MO and hold town hall meetings to explain your votes to your constituents?

So, not waiting for the review of his communications and voting for someone with clear conflicts of interest. Noted.
how is it over reaching?
you're voting for a man who sued the agency he's supposed to lead. Shame on you for caring so little about our future.
VOTE NO ON PRUITT #resist
But we WANT EPA to have juris. over ALL of MO, just like we want DOEd to have jur. over ALL sch, not just 1s that don’t need it
Yeah - clean air and water are SUPER over-rated!  If it's good enough for China, it should be good enough for us!
(he said, sarcastically)
You are terrible. I look forward to donating heavily to your opp and knocking on every door.
No, please work _against_ Pruitt's nomination. Someone who despises environmental protection shouldn't run the EPA.
It would be wise to wait until he complies with court order. You're going to get burned on this.
