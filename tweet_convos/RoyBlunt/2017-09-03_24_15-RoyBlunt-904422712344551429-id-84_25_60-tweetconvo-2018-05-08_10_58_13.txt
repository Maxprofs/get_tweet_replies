You are hopeless.  Your mindless devotion to this trainwreck of a president will be recorded by history.  #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
Another conservative lying to their constituency. They loot the country for their own gain.
Getting in fight w/prez not mistake.Being do-nothing gop leaders is. You & others disgraceful,betraying Americans the longer he's in office.
Wonder what made SenBlunt do exact opposite 4 PresBO 8yrs ago who was elected just as USConstitution prescribed + winning PopularVote
#MTP
Is @RoyBlunt royblgoibg to send his children and grandchildren to the front line in war with korea.
Stop giving the elite rich your tax breaks.  Give your $$ DIRECTLY to Texan Americans now! Hard working Texans deserve $$ & DIRECT help now.
LMAO as @RoyBlunt talking abt North Korea says that we're dealing with a leader who is spoiled & reckless. Which leader is he referring to?
I thought you did an excellent job!  I was proud to have you represent me. Keep up the good work!

Is it tax relief for average Americans or the 1%ers.  I remember gop healthcare efforts.
Try putting your face in front of Missourians IN MISSOURI. We don't live in DC like you #mosen
Why do you keep lying, @RoyBlunt? Everyone has the ability to fact check you in their pockets.
Trump team considering plan that would tax the $$ workers place into 401ks up front to pay for corporate tax cuts. http://politi.co/2wBsxoy 
You and Billy need to go. Glad to see you came back for the football game. Come back when you don't want to meet with your opponents.
I watched an you did not say shit. Blah blah blah. The fact you win reelection over and over proves the voting rules are rigged.  Resign NOW
Great leadership on display here from @RoyBluntMO So glad he's in the Senate to work on behalf of Missouri and America
Really? When was his last town hall to listen to ANY of his constituents? You are only ONE.
Notice he didn't reply back!
Rather than shying away from DT you need to call out the facts that he is not doing his job. Running USA  like a mobster is wrong.
You have forgotten you work for the people not for Trump you do what we tell you to do not Lying TRUMP & If you don't listen To Us YOUR OUT!
Hope the good people in and of Missouri vote you and @VickyHartzler out of office they deserve better.  Pull your head out of Trump's arse
Roy: We have to work with the [Constitutionally elected] President. A mistake to suggest otherwise. TRUE @SenateMajLdr didn't grant to Obama

@RoyBlunt #Trump 's NASA chairman pick is a TERRIBLE choice!  I know .@clairecmc will do the right thing and vote NO,  Please DO the same.
Every adjective you used about Kim jong un describes trump: spoiled & reckless & in control of nuclear weapons. I see significant similarity
Trump lover
Maybe you could join your MO constituents for a townhall & denounce the POS in the WH - esp tonite? #DefendDACA
The president communicates best, the wishes of a foreign power who's ideals you apparently support (aid & abed) co-traitor!
Fix the Obama factories you and McCaskill tore down https://youtu.be/yMEPwQmknlU 



Spoiled and wreckless is Trump all over again.
We need Sane Leadership. Are Trumps Generals thinking MilitaryOption Not an Option?Are theyThinking Diplomacy with NKorea?War is Unthinkable
How can U say Trump is not divisive? U R are a Republican worried about his own job & his own power Put country 1ST #Indivisible @AriMelber
Right, just continue to let him blame Congress for his ineptitude.
Monsanto finally gave you permission to get involved?
You slyly slip past questions...basically spoke a lot of words but didn't say anything
The GOP has actively rolled back minimum wage and workers' rights. #NotMyPresident isn't going to do a thing. http://nlc.org/preemption 
Chuck, please do not allow a senator on who does not represent or have an in person town hall with the people he is supposed to represent
It's sad the senator failed to mention that it's the Republican party that's keeping take-home pay low via reversing minimum wage increases.
Spoiled and reckless describes the current U.S. administration. Ashamed of you, Roy Blunt.
Compared to our previous administrations - useless and corrupt, right?
As I listened to you kiss up to the most divisive @potus I have known in my lifetime I felt sorry for the state of MO. #CountryOverParty
Your time would have been better spent actually having a town hall and listening to those you were elected to represent
Only you're not providing tax relief for American families only for corporations and other business interests..........
You suck
Most of those are mutually exclusive and NOT what would actually help Missourians. You have spent way too much time in Trump/Pence pockets
Just another asskisser spewing more BS. #ImpeachTrump & #lockhimup
Great show didn't hear one person say Trump was acting presidential thanks! Important subjects!
Sen. Blunt from MO. The state that just lowered the minimum wage. I think MAGAs birthers baggers are going to get everything they voted for.
"American Families" is that what you call the One Percent?
They're the only people Blunt cares about
Funny how you can recognize those traits in Kim jong un, but don't see that they also describe Trump, get honest, the country is hurting.
PLEASE, cut all env regs ASAP! Pavement means growth! Only GDP matters in USA. We'll GROW our way out of ALL of our problems. So simple.
Roy Blunt is a joke
Chuck Todd oozes Trump hatred from every pore.  Will never watch NBC again.
Brave of you to talk about it on tv. "Show me" you care about MO and come talk to your constituents about it. What are you afraid of Roy?
He's afraid of the truth. It's why he hides
Tax cuts only good if doesn't balloon the deficit. Don't shift debt burden to future generat'ns Be responsible. Country b4 party
Big mistake, Chuck. This guy represents big $$ only not regular citizens. Refuses to hold town hall- afraid of the little guy. #fakesenator
PLEASE, more TAX CUTS for the rich! Rich hard working job creators need more $$ in life. Being rich is the ONLY worthy goal for Americans.
"Spoiled and reckless" that's a great way to describe trump from your own party. Corker is saying the same.
And you proved yet again how much of a danger the @GOP is to America.
Blunt you said nothing of value to the people of Mo or America
And you lied
I only voted for you because of Trump.
"Spoiled & wreckless"..doesn't sound ANYTHING like .@realDonaldTrump now does it .@ChuckTodd .@RoyBlunt . Sounds like a double whammy for US
Blunt you will go down with Trump on his ship.
I suspect none of that will be accomplished
Families: Transgender Service members. Let's be consistent.
Tax relief. Â¿ details first. 
Roy when will you stand up to Trump?
And Roy, tax relief does NOT begin top down. Enrich the 1%, and their stockholders thrive! They'll find it easier to reduce workers & wages
How about we use taxes for actual relief instead of just giving wealthy people more handouts?
That sentiment is against everything @RoyBlunt stands for
"Americans" or the corporate donors you represent instead of the people of MO
You killed it. keepup the great work for us missourians
#MAGA
