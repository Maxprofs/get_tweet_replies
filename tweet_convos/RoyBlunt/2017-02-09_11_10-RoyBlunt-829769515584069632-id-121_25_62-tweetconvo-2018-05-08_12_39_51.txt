again you pick $ above integrity. @RepTomPrice would be disastrous at @HHSGov.
. @RoyBlunt @RepTomPrice can I see a copy of your replacement plan?
replace with what?
I implore you not to repeal until you have a plan to cover all Americans!
he dedicated his life to making $$ Fix the ACA and save lives. Protect those who have pre existing conditions
.@RoyBlunt #Missourians are NOT on board with corrupt @RepTomPrice as @HHSGov Sec. Read the comments, and ANSWER YOUR PHONE.
if you are so dedicated,  you wouldn't try to take away people's health care. #gaslightingAmerica

Extremely frightening.  I can't believe we live in this hell.
how did you not have a plan ready after 6 years of shouting how bad the ACA was?
call your senator and pass along https://twitter.com/captainslog2017/status/829515248541396992 … let your voice be heard if you want

Smoking kills thousands of people every year but you took money from Phillip Morris, shame on you, hypocrite!
if a dem did what he did with stocks he would have been torched
Tell ya what, ensure EVERYONE is covered then rename it Trumpcare for political cover #ThereIFixedIt #SaveACA
Looking forward to seeing that "replace" part before the repeal.
we all know that we have a better chance of getting hit by a meteorite than that happening.
what about misleading in his financial disclosure regarding health policy decisions?
... crooked roy
support  @RandPaul health care bill
He wants to abolish Obamacare, and has NO plans 4 a replacement. Also, he HATES any govt healthcare programs.
government should make no laws that do not also apply to them. Take away your health insurance that is paid with our money.
perhaps all of you on Capitol Hill should be required to obtain your insurance the same way as the people you represent.
Any stock tips from Mr. Price for us "little Americans?"
This is a lie. Your party will be responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans if you repeal the ACA.
everyone who is in roy blunt state call
Isn't this the congressman who profited from stock tranactions tied to his legislative efforts? Shame...
what is your plan to replace? We are all ears here! Peoples' lives hang in the balance!
Are you profiting from @RepTomPrice insider trading too?
do you think saying it makes it true.
.kind of like Dorothy in the wizard of oz...this ain't Kansas!!##
did he give you more than the $33,100 that #devos gave you?
https://twitter.com/captainslog2017/status/829515248541396992 … incase any here would like to keep their Medicare/ sick of paying their insurance

prepare to have a million or more march on your ass
you have no plan and no idea what you are doing without screwing all of us
he is good at taking insurance company money.
or you could listen to literally everyone and leave Obamacare alone.
What replacement? Ryan has had over 5 years to write it, but hasn't seemed to produce anything...
that's right you vote yes you will be pissing off a lot of people. We want a plan plan
can't wait for the chance to repeal, replace you
instead of cash like DeVos, did Tom Price pay you with insider stock tips? Missouri says no on Price.
https://twitter.com/captainslog2017/status/829515248541396992 … call him and voice your opinion. VOTE NO a ON price or be prepared for backlash

what's the replacement? Bankruptcy, chronic health issues, death?
you keep saying this word "replace".  Not sure you actually understand what it means.
literally ANYONE would be better than an inside trader who profits from deals with pharma companies. Anyone.
until you can give us a replacement plan, don't even think about repealing. No one believes your propaganda. #RecallBlunt
Reinstatement of lifetime caps will be a death sentence for many, and you know  it. So own it.  You don’t f-ing care.
so what about all of the people that are denied coverage and get sick in the interim?  You have no damn replace plan.
Oh, for Pete's sake!  Could you for once put Mo ahead of your own interests?
Price wants to privatize Social Security and vouchers for Medicare.   Please no.We want same benefits u have.
get a grip Roy! We want better than Price!
No repeal, no replace! #SavetheACA
#corporategreed #alternativefacts  you do not listen to the people..shameful to be a missourian
.@RoyBlunt how much did Price pay for your vote? More or less than Betsy? Missouri is ashamed. #recallRoyBlunt
You're good with backing a nominee that wants to gut Medicare? Who are you working for?
stop talking; have a town hall & you'll see that MO doesn't want these ppl. #RecallBlunt #RepMOrImpeachBlunt
Do you have any idea what your constituents really want?
you need to replace BEFORE you repeal
.@RoyBlunt I genuinely hope you have a replace in mind. I have a daughter being born in April. I'd like her, my wife, & I to have insurance.
.@RoyBlunt we're ministers, work hard for our community and to earn a living. But I have preexisting conditions. Healthcare isn't guaranteed
.@RoyBlunt we work with/for people like us who depend on ACA to be ABLE to get healthcare. Please don't delay/mess around with a replace.
you've had SIX YEARS to come up with a plan. Say NO to Price and fix the ACA. We pay you, Roy.
can you provide details on your replacement?  Shouldn't be too hard, you've had 6 years to work on it.
the replacement plan ... You know that it will literally kill people
Why Repeal? Why don't you tweak? Or better yet, advocate for universal healthcare!
We can't wait for #FullRepeal. No more excuses. 28 day delay has already cost me $1,100 in premiums.
really waiting to see what you come up with. If anything.
nobody believes you anymore. You vote for your wallet. Not the people of Missouri
Who knows, maybe he can figure how to make a buck while doing it.  Seems good at it.
He will repeal but won't replace......rather reduce healthcare.
Can we replace it with the ACA?
Why bother to convince us how great he is?  You're voting yes anyway, right?
You are a joke
@KCMikeMahoney @RepTomPrice @HHSGov       This information is true if you want to deny healthcare to millions of Americans
WOW. There is no limit to your GOP loyalty over your Missouri constituents. Trump's Tool.
But I have concerns about his ethics that make him unsuitable we can't just look past it and ignore it
.@RoyBlunt @RepTomPrice @HHSGov good thing you're taking away your constituents' healthcare. Can't have healthy AND educated voters amirite?
but what's the replacement plan? Gotta have details before it's passed!
great, tell me all about your mythical replacement. I'll be all ears from the wheelchair my preexisting condition will put me in.
Shouldn't that be improve quality & affordability of care got everyone, senator? Or are you protecting $$$$
With all due respect to @RoyBlunt , he is clueless on how to create affordable, accessible health care.
@KCMikeMahoney @RepTomPrice @HHSGov so your family lobbying for insurance companies.
What is it like to announce something, and see the terrible reaction to it from your constituents? How do you sleep?
Replace with what? Still haven't seen plan uv been touting. Town Hall, u pick where if u remember where MO is
please come home talk to us. You aren't representing me well
As a practicing physician in the state of MO I strongly object to Tom Price for HHS. Try standing for MO once
you lost my respect on the Devos debacle.  I will likely never trust anything that comes out of your mouth again
ditto
Reward a guy who uses his position to line his pockets, why am I not surprised?
you have any stock advice based on upcoming bills...smh
my friends and I rely on the AHCA, why don't you want us to have insurance?
you push ahead even as ACA is more popular than ever and you have no replacement
#showustheplan
he's gulity of insider trading and Betsy Devos is just stupid but it won't stop u from voting for either 1
Good hope you are right and he has no ties with pharma or the insurance industry.  We need people who care.
Are you still lying about a replacement
None of that matters if he abused his power.
need to repeal and replace you did not stand for Missouri you stand for your corporate interest and dollars
So sorry Roy once again you are incorrect and not honoring we, the People. 
Tom Price is guilty of insider trading by introducing bills favring  med companies he recntly invested in.
His actions in Congress represent the worst kind of Washington corruption. Your vote for him is shameful.
's record makes it clear he's intent on destroying our social safety net Defend the vulnerable NO Price #RUListeningMO
So how is that replacement coming along.
Repealing before having a replacement plan will be the downfall for the GOP
Sure, that's true in a world where "improving healthcare" = "making himself and healthcare corporations rich."
he would be outstanding and a fine man to lead the change in repealing and replacing
How are those "replace" plans coming along?
no one really literally nobody !!!!
@BarackObama won in 2008 and 2012. He won...bigly. Maybe the American people want you to leave the ACA alone.
Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and was in favor of ACA. Guess the people mean nothing.
Destroying America's health insurance system with no clue how to put it back together is not "improving health care".
History will remember you as a bigot and a murderer.
you aren't doing shit it's all hype you do not have a plan insurance company want preexisting and elderly out
Replace with what exactly??
lol
