@ACTORSandCREW Maybe you should! ADVISE & CONSENT of the Senate. Then.-CongressMay By LawVestAppointmentOfInferiorOfficers,AsTheyThinkProper
@ACTORSandCREW no requirement for hearings. He's given me no reason to trust his judgement. Esp now that there's no more accountability
@ACTORSandCREW Never said couldn't Nom. Your name calling is unnecessary.You don't need them to make point. Plus leaves more space 4 comment
@ACTORSandCREW I'm done w Big Govt intrusion into my life. Not gonna vote 4 Cand that promises more! #leavemealone #personalresposibility
@RoyBlunt Its a shame you don't even know the name of the nominee yet put a statement out like this. Your position isnt in the constitution
@ColoredSpaces @RoyBlunt And so you think O would nominate a sensible nominee while he's on way out w no accountability of future election?
@bearsmustang He nominated 2 ppl to the #SupremeCourt both were confirmed. Why with his last chance would he nominate someone nonsensible?
@ColoredSpaces He's not up for election anymore. No accountability. Can try to push anyone. He's given me no reason to trust his judgement.
@bearsmustang By your theory all Presidents can't do anything in their final year because of "no accountability" America voted twice for him
@ColoredSpaces That's typically why final years & 2nd terms are generally neg. Push through things they couldn't get done cause not popular
@bearsmustang @POTUS Hasn't made a reckless decision yet @ColoredSpaces
@jetta1p @POTUS @ColoredSpaces Are you being serious? Sometimes sarcasm doesn't translate when written. I'm seriously asking.
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch Why don't you grow some balls and simply vote 'no'?  Do your job.
@Kentroyals5 @RoyBlunt Um. That's what he said he'll do. But I don't trust the Reps by what they say. We'll see when rubber meets the road.
@bearsmustang @RoyBlunt He said he 'will not vote' as opposed to vote 'no'.
@Kentroyals5 @RoyBlunt Said he won't vote FOR the nominee(which is a yes) So then he would vote no(against). Assuming nominee gets to a vote
@RoyBlunt that is the politically version of "I'm taking my ball so no one can play." #childish
@RoyBlunt WH isn't "getting it wrong." Obama has duty to nominate. You have the right to say no, hopefully after a thoughtful evaluation.
@RoyBlunt No- the GOP has it wrong. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt And I will not vote for you. Do your damn job.
@RoyBlunt maybe the senate as a whole should take the high road!  I voted for my president for 4 years not 3
@RoyBlunt Wasn't Obama elected to a 4 year term? Isn't it his job to nominate?
@RoyBlunt the very definition of gridlock. This is why outsiders are winning!  #irrational
@RoyBlunt foolishness
@RoyBlunt Roy, I thought better of you. Your actions are unprecedented.
@RoyBlunt Do your job and take acation when POTUS makes a nomination for SCOTUS.
@RoyBlunt Why?   Obama still has what, 10 months as President?  Why SHOULDNT he be allowed to nominate someone?   You are THIS petty?
@RoyBlunt No respect for the Constitution. 1 thing to dislike the incumbent, it's another ENTIRELY to disrespect the office of the President
@RoyBlunt Don't be an obstructionist, Senator. Follow the constitution.Do your job.Don't cheat.
@RoyBlunt Explain how THEY have it wrong? What about it is wrong?
@RoyBlunt Shouldn't you interview the nominee before making a decision?
@RoyBlunt do your job!
@RoyBlunt What? How is this OK? It’s the Constitutional obligation of the @POTUS and the Senate to fill the vacancy expediently.
@RoyBlunt Seriously? As a constituent of MO, I DEMAND you speak for MY RIGHTS and vote based on their abilities, not stupid party lines!
@RoyBlunt isn't that your job?
@RoyBlunt RU seriously that stupid? @POTUS has a 4yr term last I checked. Constitution gives him this right. You are to advise & CONSENT!
You're violating our Constitution! Do your damn job! You and your cohorts are akin to dictators!  @RoyBlunt
@RoyBlunt NO. You have it wrong. It's the Constitutional duty of the president to fill the vacancy. I'm ashamed to say you represent me.
@RoyBlunt the rest of us have to do our jobs, even with bosses we don't like. #DOYOURJOB
@RoyBlunt why do you hate the constitution? Also, why do you hate the black president?
.@RoyBlunt This November voters will remember that you're refusing to do the job we elected you to do.
@RoyBlunt you are going against the Constitution and the oath you took as a Senator. Man up Roy.
Can't even fathom @RoyBlunt will not even consider the qualifications of a nominee just because "Obama" - SHAME ON YOU & YOUR DESCENDANTS.
@RoyBlunt As your constituent, I find this unacceptable.  Hold the hearings, have the vote and #DoYourJob.  November is coming soon, Senator
@RoyBlunt you are supposed to do your job. If I didn't do mine I would get fired. Do your job or resign.
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch good for you Senator we are with you in full support this is very important for the direction of the country.
@RoyBlunt WHY would you not want to do your duty as a senator and vote, you are entitled to your vote but to do nothing is a crime.
@RoyBlunt If the tables were turned and the GOP had a POTUS in office I'm sure this would not be an issue?  Lets open some history books!
@RoyBlunt In the real world, people who refuse to do their job GET FIRED, but you are a freeloader on Taxpayers. SHAME ON YOU.
@RoyBlunt I disagree with your position. SCOTUSshould be filled. President Obama was elected twice; the people spoke & we want his nominee.
@RoyBlunt I hope your constituents recall you. @txchick999
@RoyBlunt Yep...
@RoyBlunt Both U and #POTUS elected to uphold same constitution.If he does his job,you are obligated to do yours.No obstructionist excuses.
@RoyBlunt that is not constitutional precedent. And if a GOP Pres. Is not elected do you plan on keeping seat open indefinitely?
@RoyBlunt @txchick999 As usual YOU get it wrong. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt #Obstructionism
@RoyBlunt No,Sir, you have it wrong!Show me where it says the Pres not permitted to nominate #SCOTUS justice. Show me where it says no vote!
@RoyBlunt based on what authority?
@RoyBlunt Y'all know damn good and well there is no precedent for your obstruction.  But go on and HE may wind up on the court. #Shameful
@RoyBlunt Hold the vote and do your job. Not surprised however because this is the least productive congress in history. Obstructionist!
@RoyBlunt SO you have little regard for your Const. duties of advise&consent? POTUS has his job to do. Do yours, you lame duck
@RoyBlunt A total ignoramous and ideolog
@RoyBlunt Then be prepared for same in return should Dems win Senate and lose WH. #alwaysanupcomingelection #onlydifferenceislengthoftime
@RoyBlunt DO YOUR GOD DAMN JOB!
@RoyBlunt racists gonna racist.
@RoyBlunt You need to read the Constitution. The President SHALL nominate a Justice. No mention of waiting in the last year. Do your job.
@RoyBlunt is that a promise? You voted  No for Veterans benefits!
@RoyBlunt as a Missourian, I'm shocked at your abdication of your constitutional duty, senator.
@RoyBlunt   Seriously? GOP will not get the Presidency...unless you guys continue committing election fraud...Do your Constitutional duty!!
.@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob 300 days left of Obama presidency. Y'all got your ass kicked in 2012. America wants Obama to appoint justices.
@RoyBlunt millions out of work, yet you refuse to do the job you are paid for. Step aside and let someone with integrity take over.
@RoyBlunt PRESIDENT Barack Obama was elected to a four-year term just like every white President before him. Do your job!
@RoyBlunt Refusing even a hearing on SC nominee because it's the last year of a presidency has never been done before. Unprecedented.
@RoyBlunt The WH has it right-they're following the Constitution.
@RoyBlunt People of America want you to do your job or be fired.You work for us, or have you forgotten you're paid w/taxpayers' money $$$ ?
@RoyBlunt You have a Constitutional duty to the American people. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt in case you forgot your sworn oath: http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Oath_Office.htm … #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt then you should resign... I get fired when I don't do my job... You're despicable and probably have a small 
@RoyBlunt you are wrong to say this w/o knowing who it is. Wait to see perhaps it  be a person who find common ground
@RoyBlunt Admit it: you cowards just don't have the balls to hold a vote.
@RoyBlunt you can vote "no" but  you have to do your job, it's why you were elected. Just like Obama's job is to nominate SCOTUS justices.
@RoyBlunt You are choosing to nullify my vote of 11/6/12. How very Constitutional & Patriotic of you - shitting on us lowly citizens/rights.
@RoyBlunt 
This tweet Senator is EXACTLY why Trump is about to win the nomination. People are sick of do nothing politicians like you
@RoyBlunt And yet you will still expect a paycheck, give yourself a raise, and vote to NOT raise the min wage. Priceless. Dildo.
.@RoyBlunt so basically you refuse to do the job you are being paid for?
@RoyBlunt good idea Roy. Let Clinton nominate Obama who will be confirmed by a democratic senate.
@RoyBlunt  while you are busy doing nothing, maybe take that time to read the Constitution.  #scotus
@RoyBlunt  GOP practicing nullification again. Get over your white supremacist self.
@RoyBlunt You obstructionist moron.
@RoyBlunt your choice: Obama's SCOTUS nominee or Obama as the SCOTUS nominee
@RoyBlunt So ... the POTUS will do his job and nominate someone but you will not do yours?
@RoyBlunt If I had said, in 1984 in the Navy, "I won't stand watch until the inauguration" I would have been court-martialed. Dildo.
@RoyBlunt Why would new POTUS have greater mandate than twice elected sitting POTUS?
@RoyBlunt Risky play.
@RoyBlunt You claim to represent Missouri and are honored to do so? Do your job.
@RoyBlunt so you only abide by the Constitution when it is convenient...it really does not mean anything to you at all
@RoyBlunt maybe take a civics class or something. Or watch School House Rocks. Might clear up some of your confusion.
@RoyBlunt show me where it says that in the constitution.
@RoyBlunt then you should not have a job. Clearly you don't want to actually do work, but still get paid. #lazybumonthegovtdime
@RoyBlunt Jackass.
@RoyBlunt glad to know of another senator who hates the Constitution. Try upholding what you swore to uphold, and put partisanship aside.
@RoyBlunt idiot
@RoyBlunt do your job
@RoyBlunt You have a degree in history, Senator. Look it up. #Liar
@RoyBlunt GOP spineless windsocks, too afraid for your jobs to take on the extremists in your own party.
@RoyBlunt you should be ashamed of yourself.
@RoyBlunt Actually, you are wrong. And doing the wrong thing!
@RoyBlunt If you don't want to do the job you were elected to do, and that taxpayers pay you to do, then you should resign.
@RoyBlunt what if @HillaryClinton or @BernieSanders wins?
@RoyBlunt It's PBO's job to nominate someone so do your job or stop accepting your salary!
@RoyBlunt what if he nominates a good candidate? Base your vote on the nominee.
@RoyBlunt jackass
@RoyBlunt #asshat
@RoyBlunt Did you just make up that rule while on the toilet? It'll be great when u lose Senate, Presidency, and Obama appointed 9th SCOTUS
@RoyBlunt shame on you! if you really were about this county, you would not be obstructing the @POTUS.
@RoyBlunt Wish I had a job where I could refuse to perform my duties & still get paid. Your ilk created 'Trump'.
@RoyBlunt delete your account and resign your seat.
@RoyBlunt wow
@RoyBlunt  so what? @david_kamande @murigikamande @SP_Me
@ankosami @RoyBlunt @david_kamande @murigikamande about what?
@RoyBlunt Ignorant.
@RoyBlunt shame on you!!!
@RoyBlunt The people have already spoken... by electing Obama TWICE! Do your job and VOTE!
@RoyBlunt No you sir have it wrong  READ THE CONSTITUTION
@RoyBlunt as usual, obstructionist GOP won't recognize the will of people. Obama elected twice precisely so he could fill #SCOTUS seat
@RoyBlunt are you going to vote for Clinton nomination?
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt @lenlucas46 reading the comments from the libs reaffirmed for me you're doing the right thing! Stay strong eye for an eye! #HA
@RoyBlunt Might want to wait & see who's nominated, so don't end up with egg on face. Election year, & Obama could make you look like fools.
@RoyBlunt you're wrong the citizens did decide the sitting president gets to appoint. Unless a supreme court judge isn't important
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch good! You better not...we need Americans politicians to stand against the progressives
.@RoyBlunt Respectfully disagree Senator Blunt. What Senate is doing is unconstitutional and unprecedented. Nominee should be confirmed ASAP
@RoyBlunt do your job.
@RoyBlunt doesn't matter who the President is, process is all that matters and you are failing your duty sir.
@RoyBlunt do your job
@RoyBlunt Because nothing says "let's honor a dead SCOTUS judge & champion of the Constitution" like pissing on the Constitution.
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch I appreciate you clearing this up. I was quite alarmed by the news but wanted to hear it from you before I made calls
@RoyBlunt Honor the Constitution and the people of this great land who voted in 2012. Please vote up or down on a nomination and #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt You're a good man.
@RoyBlunt all of those against this seems to be Obama and Clinton supporters even Biden knows the difference
@RoyBlunt stand you ground democrats tried that in 92 and 06 but it was alright when they wanted to wait
@RoyBlunt Trust you won't be taking a salary then as you aren't doing your job?
@RoyBlunt Way to keep an open mind. Great way to govern, really.
@RoyBlunt thank you!!!!
@RoyBlunt hack
@RoyBlunt You've got to be embarrassed for your self, right?  Come on...
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch Make sure you keep your promise
@PaineFan01 @RoyBlunt I never consider race when blocking only personality and character
@RoyBlunt honey....YOU got it WRONG....as ALWAYS.  #Obama is @POTUS...NOT YOU.   Dream on.
@RoyBlunt Does your party actually do their job or just block others from doing theirs? We voted our pres in. The people have decided.
@RoyBlunt Please help and donate to Roy's retirement fund today! --> https://www.jasonkander.com/c/contribute---homepage-federal …
@RoyBlunt Nominee shouldn't even come out of committee, let alone vote & dog/pony show it'll bring. He won election BUT we won House/Senate.
@RoyBlunt When Senators think election wins only count if it's their party. #GOPFail
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch Just words right now sir.We'll see when leadership folds under POTUS & media pressure.Many Americans don't trust est Reps
@RoyBlunt Thank you, Senator!!
@RoyBlunt All right, welcome to the minority, Democrat presidents legitimacy cast in doubt by Republicans will drive Democrats to the polls
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch I think that we should consider the president's nominee. Remember, this could be an issue in the 2016 election.
Thank you @RoyBlunt this is an important issue. Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden agreed...when it was convenient for their party. Stand firm!
@RoyBlunt would love to have you call in to our morning drive IHeart radio Show for S Florida 7-10 am EST 800 889-0267
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch Amen, but we shouldn't openly defy US Const we hold true Yesterday&TODAY follow the process 2a point&runout of time 2Vote
@RoyBlunt Why do you hate the Constitution?
@RoyBlunt I will remember that when the election comes around. Dereliction of duty.
@ShuttletrainTED @RoyBlunt that is precisely his duty to vote against a nominee if sees fit. If POTUS nominates then shouldn't confirm
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch putting it Bluntly.
@RoyBlunt @DLoesch Thank you Roy Blunt.
@RoyBlunt 
Thank you
@RoyBlunt why?
@RoyBlunt And Joe Biden would agree you shouldn't have too.  Well, 1992 Joe Biden, that is.
