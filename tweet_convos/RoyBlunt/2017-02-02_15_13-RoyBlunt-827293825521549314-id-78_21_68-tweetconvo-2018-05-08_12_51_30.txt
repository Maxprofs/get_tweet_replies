and so did Judge Garland. Your words are hypocritical to say the least.
we don't want Gorsuch, VOTE NO...MO is watching...2158 days or less n office #LastTermBlunt #ImpeachBlunt
vote yes on the nomination for the education secretary and our highest court.
Like Merrick Garland, whose seat this really is?
You should vote Garland into that spot. But you stalled for a year. #noSCOTUSvoteForTrumpsLastYear
McConnell was right.  The people need a voice for the SCOTUS nominee and Trump didn't get a majority of votes.  Next time.
It wouldv'e have been nice to hear Garland testify about his philosophy of law, too. Oops, you didn't care about the law then.
And still does not care about the law
NO VOTE FOR THE OBSTRUCTIONIST REPUBLICANS.  #WORSTSENATOREVER
He has also said corporations are people! VOTE NO! Try to put your constituents ahead of ur greed & ur CLOSE ties to LOBBYISTS!
you mean he will apply the evangelical religious interpretation of the Bible. That IS to legislate from the bench!
it'd be nice if #devos understood the job of looking out for education of the average American child #DeVosvote #holdthefloor
Sen @RoyBlunt you ignored a centrist candidate for almost a year. This candidate does not have a record for all the people.
Even @RoyBlunt believes Sens DON'T need to meet w/ #SCOTUS noms. So don't be mad when Dems refuse #GorsuchNomination
apply the rule of law is good, as abortions is LEGAL, as is the right to free,appropriate public education #NoDeVod
Merrick Garland deserves this seat. Let Gorsuch have the next one that comes up. Those of us in Missouri deserve better than this.
Thanks Senator Blunt  for inauguration participation- I want Gorsuch, too! git R done-I know you will!  Love DJT-my hero. MAGA!
Sounds like your constituents are not behind you. I tried to vote you out last fall. If I'm still alive next time you run, bye bye
Since we're the ones actually voting, maybe you should worry about what your constituents want instead of your campaign donators.

Exactly. Does @RoyBlunt think we can't find this stuff out?
too old and rich to care.
You TRULY DO NOT listen to the people you represent.  BLOCK DeVoss at the VERY least. The people of MO are not stupid!
now all we need is legislators that haven't sold their soul to corporations and special interest.....don't be so self righteous
didn't take you very long to vet Judge Gorsuch.  You are a hypocrite  Mr. Blunt.
And the job of the #senate is to advise and consent, not stonewall and ignore, like you did to Garland, you #sackofshit
what a crock In #BlackHistoryMonth you support a racist into Supreme Court

And DeVos understands what???
you and #DeVos are an embarrassment to this country. Constitution says #WeThePeople, not 'We the Corporations' lining your pockets
I look forward to an honest judge, Judge Gorsuch has a great track record of enforcing US Constitution. TY 4 supporting him
I hope you get voted out of office after turning on your Missouri constituents like me and voting Devos and Gorsuch is not fit!
what do your constituents want? Don't be the person that chases money, do the right thing #DumpDevos
GOP Sens John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, & Jim Inhofe voted yes on #MerickGarland fed appointment. NO #GorsuchNomination
.@RoyBlunt 175+ fed. ct of appeals judges appointed by presidents understand the job of #SCOTUS, doesn't mean they're worthy of the seat.
Hobby Lobby is a corporation, not a person. Gorsuch DID legislate from the bench. Garland DESERVED a hearing. #GarlandNotGorsuch
What did you think of Merrick Garland. Be prepared to answer in person.
exactly who we need!
So did #MerrickGarland ... hypocrite.
you're the worst. Delete your account.
what's really a riot is he says Democrats need to put their political affiliation aside and confirm #GorsuchNomination.
you're an embarrassment to Missourians.
have a qualification hearing first? Your not a yes man for @POTUS you work for us, the people, without billions of dollars

How do I put this? #nomuslimban  #NoBanNoWall #nodavos #Nogorsuch #nobannon #noblunt #townhallinmo
Too bad we never got to hear from Merrick Garland. This seat was stolen.

big NO- uphold the Constitution actually means something and it doesn't include RELIGION!
Bullshit.  You just want a conservative in there because you think he will overturn Roe V Wade.  Won't happen. No to DeVos.
Too bad you don't realize your job is to represent your constituents and vote not on DeVos! #DumpDevos
Don't vote for this creep.
Do YOU understand YOUR job is to represent the people of MO and not your donors?
Probably safe to say MO voters like Gorsuch.
I was referring to the overwhelming opposition by MO voters to DeVos. Yet Blunt continues to express his support.
Seriously? You expect us to buy this bill of goods?
Well in that case Roe v Wade is safe since it is the settled law of the land, correct Senator?
Merrick Garland! Say his name!
would have been nice to hear Garlands opinions. Oh u decided he wasn't worth listening to. Don't complain when Dems try to do same
the rule of law in America does not align with someone who founded a Fascism Forever club, listen to MO not your pocketbook
this man does not represent this Missourian's interests
Yet @BetsyDeVos thinks 40+ yr old #IDEA law should revert to states?  You can be conservative but don't be a hypocrite.#Integrity
If only MO could find someone who understands that a Senator's job is to represent the people and not a party or special interest
Blunt's has sold the great state of Missouri down the river
Does he legislate from his pocket book like you do? #StolenSeat #MerrickGarland
would you like to divulge the final tallies from your constituents' calls/emails/etc. on Gorsuch?
#MerrickGarland
I don't feel like you are accurately representing us
and he never will.
he's for the Hobby Lobby law... which gives religious freedom to a company and not a person! How is that ok?
funny how some people only have a problem with "legislating" judges when it's for an issue they disagree with
What is wrong with you...we don't want him & you rep MO...vote NO, MO says NO & Hell NO on devos #RepMOrImpeachBlunt
But you stood by and never let Garland even have a hearing, so anything you say on this topic is hypocrisy.
so does Merrick Garland. Hypocrite.
#MerrickGarland
Like GOP hero Scalia did? Originalism is just nonsense, and used, like states' rights, when it's convenient. Don't insult us, sir.
Cut the bullshit, Senator.
Stop saying these meaningless words. You just want a justice that cowtows to corporations and religion, while screwing over people

hobby lobby might agree with you but Missourians don't
no
