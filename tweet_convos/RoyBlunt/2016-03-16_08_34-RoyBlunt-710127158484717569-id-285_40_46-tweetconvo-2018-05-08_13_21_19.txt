@RoyBlunt thank you!
@bgsatterlee @RoyBlunt For what; not doing his job?
@dougom I know you liberals had high hopes for subjugation under Obama.  Sorry. @RoyBlunt is promising to execute his duties perfectly.
@_DOMMination wrong. Read art 2,sec 2, clause 2. There is no oblig to a hearing. Not there.The absence of a hearing is the lack of consent.
@_DOMMination you may WANT them to give a hearing but they have no obligation to. Your recourse then is to not vote for them again.
@_DOMMination I have done all I can do here. Read the constitution.
@RoyBlunt is it any wonder Congress is so despised? Childish nonsense.
@RoyBlunt good to hear.
@RoyBlunt How do you justify this?
@RoyBlunt Glad you can make such an important decision without the benefit of interview or hearings, sounds like you need a new job.
.@RoyBlunt @POTUS did his job, now Missouri voters demand you do yours! Hold the SCOTUS confirmation hearing!
@RoyBlunt should US Senators b blocked from doing their job during last yr in office? POTUS was elected for 8yrs- Sen. should do its job
@RoyBlunt find your balls give back the NRA money Define Mitch McConnell that is bought and paid for we expect more from you  vote scotus
@RoyBlunt Give Merrick Garland a hearing! #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt I agree. Your successor should!!!
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob or resign.
.@RoyBlunt @Rebecca_221B #Maddow I would be fired for refusing to do my job. I am your constituent. I am doing my job at the polls this Nov.
@RoyBlunt @BeckyMorganMO
@RoyBlunt  conservatives always complain about wasteful government spending, we pay you $174k to do nothing #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt You should do your job while you still have one.
@RoyBlunt Bush v Gore was decided in a 5-4 decision, imagine if only been 8 #SCOTUS seats were filled- stop playing politics, #DoYourJob
.@RoyBlunt you don't have to vote, but the guy deserves a hearing. Dismissing a life of service like this is a poor choice on your part
@RoyBlunt You're exactly what's wrong with the government #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt because he was nominated by a democrat? Are there any other legitimate reasons?
@RoyBlunt Thank you for not voting for their nominee to supreme court. it's time to take a stand like this
.@RoyBlunt you're going to vote no or you're not going to do your job and not vote at all? There's a difference #SCOTUSnominee
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Since you're up for reelection, please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt The American people deserve a fully functioning Supreme Court. Please #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt I'm your constituent. Do your job or I will vote for someone who will
@RoyBlunt Sad state of affairs when "magic" is a higher priority in the Senate than the Supreme Court! #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt I voted for you last election. Won't make that mistake again. #doyourjob
.@RoyBlunt This isn't difficult. This is not a complicated provision of the #Constitution. If you believe Garland is unqualified, vote "no."
@RoyBlunt So, why is Orrin Hatch wrong on this nominee?
@RoyBlunt Really?!?!?!  Unacceptable.  #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt will not vote, or will not approve? #DoYourJob you're up for re-election.  I'll vote you out.  #FedUp
@RoyBlunt Sir, by refusing to hold a hearing you're not giving voice to anyone at all. Please respect the citizens you serve #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt You were elected to do your job for 6 years, just as @POTUS was elected to do his for 4. He is doing his; do yours.
.@RoyBlunt And yet you expect that your constituents will vote to re-elect you in November. Why when you won't #DoYourJob ?
@RoyBlunt Your job is to evaluate and vote on nominees based on their qualifications, not childish political gamesmanship
@RoyBlunt why do you think you don't have to do your job? I'll make sure I do mine I vote!
@RoyBlunt do your job please, or I guess the people of your state will vote you out. #DoYourJobSenate
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt you owe the nominee a confirmation hearing at least. To not even hold a hearing is not upholding your duty.
@RoyBlunt this is disheartening.
@RoyBlunt fine but have the hearings debate vote no vote yes but do your job
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob you get paid enough. Take your head out of your ass and do what you've been elected to do.
@RoyBlunt Let the American people have their voice when they elected Obama in '12. He was elected for 4 years not 3. #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt do your job - or donate you pay for not working
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob this party politics is infuriating- why people think Trump is an option a horrible option but #youhaveyourselftoblame
@RoyBlunt if you don't want to the duties associated with your job, guess we need to vote for someone who will.
@RoyBlunt Without giving the nominee a chance at a hearing? #DoYourJob or step down.
@RoyBlunt can you say why you won't vote for this nominee for SCOTUS?
@RoyBlunt You GOPers are always going on about personal responsibility. What if more responsible than to #DoYourJob?
@RoyBlunt Meeting w/ your son's math teacher is important; meeting a #SCOTUS nominee IS YOUR JOB. If I behaved like that, I'd get fired.
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob Senator. It's what you were elected for. Sorry the court may (finally!) swing left, but meeting & voting IS YOUR JOB.
.@RoyBlunt This is wrong. I don't do my job, I get fired. You should do your job.
@RoyBlunt care to provide a reason on your decision?
@RoyBlunt   Know I will not be voting for you Senator.
@RoyBlunt - It seems a lot of your constituency would like you to do your job of representing them.
@RoyBlunt Fine. As long as there's a vote. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt If you refuse to do your job, you should be fired, just like anyone else. #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt The people gave their voice 4 years ago. You are trying to derail democracy!
@RoyBlunt Did you meet him already? Question him privately? Not "this" nominee. someone else in mind? Because 300+ days let in @Potus term
@RoyBlunt FYI, the American people did vote and picked Pres. Obama to nominate SC judges. Much to your chagrin.
@RoyBlunt  #DoYourJob or get out!
@RoyBlunt You haven't fulfilled your duty as elected, so why should I then continue to support you with my vote here in Mo? #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt I don't get to choose what I do and don't do on my job - NEITHER DO YOU -- NO WORK - NO PAY! #DoYourJob #DefundRoyBlunt
@RoyBlunt ,
Well Done!
Garland is a tree hugging,job killing,Big government Progressive-
Would be an insult to memory of Scalia!
And I will not vote for @RoyBlunt who is up for reelection #Election2016 #DoYourJob  #GOP
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJOb it's people like you who are the reason americans hate government. Partisan bullshit.
@RoyBlunt #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt Be an adult and do your job! So glad I never voted for you!
@RoyBlunt What are your objections to the nominee? The Senate needs to do its job. The President just did.
@RoyBlunt Why not? Will you vote at all? #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Wrong. It's about voting for the person. Time ain't mentioned in the Constitution that you obviously despise. #DoYourJob
.@RoyBlunt So you're declaring to the world that you are a traitor who will fail to honor his oath of office? You have a job to do senator!
@RoyBlunt Do your job. Good grief.
@RoyBlunt #Doyourjob or resign Roy Blunt!
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob or RESIGN IMMEDIATELY!
@RoyBlunt Will you release a statement that gives your reason for not voting for this nominee? Or have you already somewhere else?
@RoyBlunt Stop playing games. The American people want you to #doyourjob!! #SCOTUSnominee
@RoyBlunt your support of political paralysis why I'm voting for @JasonKander this November. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt its OK to vote him down - but not to refuse him a hearing. We need a full court. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee #goodgovernment
@RoyBlunt Do your job.
@RoyBlunt Wait, I forgot, you people collect your paycheck. That is ALL you do.
@RoyBlunt W/in hour of nomination, you announce you won’t follow Constitution & even hold a hearing? Vote Yes, vote no, but vote. #DoYourJob
"When the President seeks the advice and consent of the Senate, it is their constitutional duty to do their jobs." @RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt The American people reelected President Obama for a 4 year term, not 3 and a half. His voice is ours, and ours his #DoYourJob!
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Check the Constitution. You're being paid to do a job; do that job or resign.
@RoyBlunt Heaven forbid you have to do your job, you fuckstick.
@RoyBlunt We pay you. Do your job or you will lose your job.
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt # do your job.
@RoyBlunt Good, start planning for your retirement.  The LU again for making the word "government" a bad one. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt yes we deserve to have our voices heard. We already have.  We elected the Senators who currently hold office. Do your job now
@RoyBlunt Then you will be voted out of office. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Garland said his SCOTUS nom is the best thing ever to happen. You want to reject him without even a vote. Do you sleep at night?
#DoYourJob @RoyBlunt
@RoyBlunt #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt Hilary is very likely to win the Presidency. What then? Allow a vote and act on the issues at hand.
@RoyBlunt it looks like you're not real popular Roy,and you won't be re elected #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt, What does it say when a sitting Senator refuses to even meet with a potential #SCOTUSnominee? Nothing good.
@RoyBlunt please reconsider your position. We are in the primaries, not presidential campaign. The nominee is a great choice.
@RoyBlunt and don't wait up for my vote in November!
@RoyBlunt Good to know you've got an open mind
.@RoyBlunt I am a constituent. I want you to vote on SCT nomination or many of us will not vote for you.
@RoyBlunt why don't you do your job. What happens when your party doesn't win the election? What will your excuse be then? #SCOTUS
@RoyBlunt The PEOPLE already chose, twice. @POTUS gets to nominate. Do your job or lose your job.
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt The American people elected a president who has 307 days left in term. It's disrespectful to us, the office, the court. #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt Appalled that you refuse to do your duty as a senator by refusing to consider the nomination. Politics over justice. Resign
@RoyBlunt We're all tired of McConnell's "Party of No" where nothing gets done. Have some courage for once and tell that ugly ass, "No!".
@RoyBlunt I am not surprised that MY Senator will not do his job. We re-elected President Obama to do his job for 4 yrs. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt God Damn. Who votes for people like Blunt??
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob and realize your wrongs. You are a SENATOR, one who is abusing powers and failing to serve the American people.
@RoyBlunt Senator: Should lame duck members of Congress retain their right/privileges? Something else NOT in US Constitution. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Just too busy? Can I use your excuse for not doing my job?
@RoyBlunt Because you are not doing your job and will be taken out of office in November. I would be fired so quick if I acted this way.
@RoyBlunt Trying to understand endgame. Passing up reasonable, centrist nom, betting on GOP WH? Good luck with that. #NeverTrump
@RoyBlunt And good luck with your base. Their anger when they realized you fucked up and fucked them over AGAIN will be visible from orbit.
@RoyBlunt or maybe you should do the job you were elected to do.
.@RoyBlunt so nice of you to give the POTUS's nominee the careful review they are due. You waited a whole 20 minutes before blowing them off
@RoyBlunt why?
@RoyBlunt I will not vote for you in November.
@RoyBlunt because you're busy calling your kid's math teacher? PATHETIC
@RoyBlunt  Just found out that @JasonKander is running against you in November. I'm sure he'll be happy to do the job you refuse to do.
@RoyBlunt do your job.
@RoyBlunt do black presidents only get 3/5ths term?
@RoyBlunt can't wait to vote you out of office. #doyourjob
@RoyBlunt And down goes another Senator. Mo. Will vote him out.
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob Your refusal is hurting the country, this is an excellent choice for SCOTUS.
@RoyBlunt I'd like you, the president, and the supreme court to continue working.  POTUS seems up for the job, how about the Senate?
@RoyBlunt Because why? Because you're a petty obstructionist.Get some morals & backbone.And find time for your kid's math teacher.
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Please clarify-Are you saying you would vote no or just not vote?Sad if it is the second as a sign of a Spineless Coward. #SCOTUS
@RoyBlunt It is unfair to deny the candidate a hearing.  Play fair!
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob or lose your job next voting season.
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt is your name rhyming slang?
@RoyBlunt why?
@RoyBlunt sorry you can't manage parental responsibility and the job you are paid to do - many Americans manage their time better
@RoyBlunt Do your job and hear the nominee out. Otherwise, we WILL vote you out of office. Remember, it is an election year for you.
@RoyBlunt Roy it's really simple do your job or you are
@dj_burek @RoyBlunt no it's their job to have due process not arbitrarily rule
@dj_burek @my2bits4u @RoyBlunt Yet Blunt says "no" prior to or concurrently with announcement. He's dug n his heels & wont change. #GOTVNov
@dj_burek @my2bits4u @RoyBlunt My two decades with Blunt (Rep then Sen) says it's a done deal for him. Won't change his mind. Won't listen.
.@RoyBlunt Why should people re-elect you if you're not going to do your job?
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt In other words it's a waste of my time to call or write?!? Yep, same ol same ol...Two decades of not listening. #GOTV #KanderForMO
@RoyBlunt then I look forward to voting against you in the next election. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt thank you
.@RoyBlunt You are violating 100 years of precedent saying lame duck Missouri senators won't weigh in on if prez should pick SCOTUS nom!
@RoyBlunt Blatantly refusing to do your job because you are too busy being petty and spiteful, Ridiculous.
@RoyBlunt Do they like oath breakers in Missouri? Remember yours? To uphold the Constitution not the GOP. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt This is an abdication of duty and a pathetic partisan action and the losers are the American people. #ashamedofmysenator
“@RoyBlunt: I will not vote for this nominee to the Supreme Court. (3/3)” #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt You should resign today if you aren't going to do your job and I look forward to voting you out of office in November.
@RoyBlunt Really. How much do you #GetPaid?
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt senator acting like a petulant child. Sad. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Do your job or resign!
@RoyBlunt when you're not so far up the farm lobby's ass, you're just a useless senator living on the tax payer's dime not doing your job
@RoyBlunt not voting for the President's nominee is your right as a senator; however, not having a hearing is dereliction of duty.
@mjr9201 @RoyBlunt well said. #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt thought rejecting nominees required an INTERVIEW first? Lol... they just made the judge, black !
@RoyBlunt that's fine as you and your cronies continue to write the narrative as to why the American people are tired of Washington.
@RoyBlunt U had ur chance Roy! WE THE PEOPLE (MISSOURIANS) DESERVE BETTER! Stop Mitch and Roy NOW! Vote for Jason Kander. He can't be worse!
@RoyBlunt Missourians should go to FreedomWorks site to see how ROY VOTED TO FUND OBAMACARE EXIM BANK TPA/TPP  INCREASED SPENDING EVERY YEAR
@RoyBlunt Save it Roy! Election year rhetoric! U R ESTABLISHMENT RINO ALL THE WAY! I am life-long CONSERVATIVE but voting for Jason Kander!!
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob, Senator
@RoyBlunt Why not; you don't know who s/he is?! #SCOTUSnominee
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob Nah. Roy says #LetDonaldDecide Maybe a fellow Missourian? Justice Limbaugh!
@RoyBlunt @RebeccaShabad Thank you!
@RoyBlunt do you care to explain why
@RoyBlunt The point of a hearing is for you to HEAR. Prejudging that is ridiculous. #DoYourJob
.@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob, deadbeat
@RoyBlunt Do your job
@JamesOverholt @RoyBlunt And I'll do all I can to block your reelection Roy Blunt.Good Luck
@RoyBlunt #DoYourJob
@RoyBlunt Publically call on Senate leadership to begin process-do-your jobs-that's what we're paying you for this term. Earn you pay!
@RoyBlunt I will not vote for you in November. #GOPFail
@RoyBlunt By declaring this before a hearing, you are simply an obstructionist to the Constitution.
@RoyBlunt Hold firm!
@RoyBlunt and I will not vote for you in November. I'm a Missouri resident, and you're pitiful representation. #SCOTUSnominee
