- SENATOR: there has been NO RESPONSE! PR GOV has no Twitter acct & no pull w @USDOD. NEED @USNSComfort, #armycorpsengineers
What about @fema?
They're supposedly there but I think PR was hit so badly they need more than just FEMA.
I agree! Multiple @USNavy ships have been in area since Irma hit, but they will definitely need more.
Please visit the island too. Plan a trip w/Schumer and Gillibrand.
Yes please
Thank you! Please keep the pressure on to help PR now. To let Americans massively die of thirst, disease and starvation should be a crime.
How about talking to the President, you may find out he has it under control. Stop Grandstanding Senator!!
Trump haters will never give him anything but lip talk. Puerto Rico will be taken care of.
Thank you Sen. Bill Nelson! Puerto Rico needs us! 
Shouldn't this be the job of the president?
Sorry Senator, the President is too busy trolling NFL players and having a twitter war with North Korean officials! SAD!
From two days ago, but don't let facts get in the way...
What part of additional search and rescue, medical, and construction teams do you not understand! Nobody said they weren't recieving aid!
Thank you, Senator. Please do not forget PR.
It must be nice to call on other people to do the actual work, and then tweet about it to take credit.
Spoken like a true Democrat.
Focus on Representing Florida
Lemme guess GOP? We are getting help here much more quickly. They are isolated. They are Americans.
Amazing that some don't know that they are Americans. And they call themselves christians.
"Pro life" phony Christians
"Pro Pre-Life" once you're here you're on your own
Thank you  keep yelling, hopefully the WH will act!
Thank you @SenBillNelson my family & millions of other citizens in #PuertoRico are desperately in need of help! 
I would like to see budget $$ reallocated to Puerto Rican aid. Lives are at stake!
Please help! It doesn’t feel like anything is happening. Puertoricans are desperate!
RU the commander in chief? @nfl Please #TakeTheKnee in Puerto Rico in front of  flag so that @potus can stop deflecting from #TrumpsKatrina
Am calling on Bill Nelson to explain why selling across state lines was left out of original ACA
Thank you, as 45 is too busy harassing the NFL.  Nothing is more important to 45 right now!! SAD
Attention commander in chief
Americans require assistance desperately
Where are the #armycorpsengineers Never more needed. They need to be in PR. #UnidosPorPR #UnidosPorPuertoRico
Falls on deaf ears as 45 is more worried about the NFL.
Thank you, Senator Nelson.
We can stage complex mil exercises, but they appear incapable of a timely CRISIS response to our PR/USVI citizens in desperate conditions!
The Divider in Chief is too busy with NFL fake news instead of sending aid to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
From two days ago...

Why is this taking so long? These are citizens we need to help them now
Thanks for helping Puerto Rico.
It's taking too long. People there are in dire circumstances & the govt is sitting, doing nothing. Shocking.
Thanks!
So good to hear, Senator. Thank you.
That's your job to send them Senator Dumb Ass. The military can't send itself.
Thank you for your support! Puerto Rico needs help desperately @fema  #PuertoRicoSeLevanta #unidosporpuertorico
Also communicating is sparse with families! Many here in FL haven’t heard from loved ones in rural areas.
Yes indeed those AMERICAN CITIZENS in Puerto Rico & THE V.I. need HELP NOW!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you, Senator. We have a military 4 this exact reason! Navy ships, logistics personnel, communications etc. #USVI #PuertoRico CITIZENS
Thank you Sen. Nelson! On a side note, shut down Equifax!  They can't get away with this. Fine them and send funds to PR
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Now please send a letter to POTUS.
Please do so!  Our families need help!!
... all the necessary resources needed for a smoother transition into civility.  We knew it was coming unlike the enemy we sometimes..
.
... encounter.  It is time.for responsible & conscientious politicians just as yourself to bring others to reason.  Thank you sir.
Puerto Rico front and center, Senator. They are suffering. Thank you.
Where are the aircraft carriers, and other vaunted Navy boats, that are supposed to be able to help?
Thank you, Senator!  Please be more presidential than the "president" and help Puerto Rico get the aid it so desperately needs.
Thank goodness you are doing something !
What the next step beyond a call for action?
Where has our 'president' been? @jupiter896 @TweetHispano @SocialPowerOne1 @Tigerfists88 @SenKamalaHarris @RedCross

I thought they were. There we dozens of ships and C130's sent over!
Thank you Senator! Finally someone is acting to help these poor people!
What about food and water?
Yes please. Sad level of response compared to comparatively mild Florida damage.
Perfect
Thank you Senator.
So you're telling me #Trump can delegate the dropping of the mother of all bombs to a general,but the generals can't go save Puerto Rico?
ikr? He should drop the Mother of all Airdrops on #PuertoRico and give them much needed water, food & supplies
Exactly.
Send medical teams with OR and water but Cruise ships could evacuate 1000s
Thank you Senator Nelson. Puerto Rico has been forgotten by US.
Thank you, my best Florida senator!!
National Guard**
THANK you, Senator Nelson!! To USVI too.
What about monetary aid as well? We helped TX & FL. US Virgin Islands also need help.
Thank you. In all of our President's megalomania I thought the people of Puerto Rico were forgotten
So many misinformed people in this thread.
Thank you! Now kill S. 1073
@Maddow @MaddowBlog @SteveBenen @CoryGn @Oleta @TriciaMcKinney @WillAtWork Please watch! There is a massive land grab in Congress S. 1073 
Yes.  Need to do more for PR. Does Pres.  know it's America?
Thank you Senator!
Thank you! Glad someone in DC is trying to get help for people. Maybe if they all took a knee then @realDonaldTrump would pay attn to them?
thank you!  I hope Congress and @realDonaldTrump will follow your leadership role and spearhead #PuertoRicoRelief
Sigh, they already did....TWO DAYS AGO!!!
and Trump signed a declaration days ago too: pass that: there's a lot more that can be done, including Comfort;  http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/25/meet-usns-comfort-navy-hospital-ship-that-has-treated-thousands-around-world.html ….
Thank you sir.
Amen! Help Americans and stop killing civilians in Afghanistan Syria etc
I was just about to look you up and say same! Keep telling D.C.!
Thank you for staying focused on what matters, people in need. Not crazy NFL distractions. On to health care.
Thank you!
What is taking so long? Jesus, help Puerto Rico NOW!
Finally good idea
We should also #SendTheComfort and the Mercy as soon as possible. The order needs to be given now.
Im calling on that as well as chief of staff taking Trumps phone from him before he gets innocent people nuked.
Thank you Bill Nelson         #someone hasabrain #PuertoRicoIsAmerica #PuertoRicans #PuertoRicoRelief
Why the wait?  Unacceptable response.
I am calling on the military to remove the most dangerous man on the planet from the WH!
Thank you for your leadership. Please don't give up.

Thanks Bill.
Good. Thank you.
Thank you!!
Yet you don't want to fully fund them? You don't get it both ways.
YES YES YES YES!
Thank you for remembering our fellow Americans!
Way to go Bill!!!!
Are there any bills pending?   You can't be the only voice for those in PR?
Thank you
Can you help me? We want to send a generator to our friends, but can't seem to get it there
Thank you for taking a stand to help Americans
What 's truly alarming,now Is that 70k ppl in harm's way,no communication to warn them of dam breaking in Puerto Rico...where are the teams?
Yes, never been so in depth with our political landscape.#SinceTrump searching out the good guys is hard to do. Found another today. Ty Sen
@realDonaldTrump what are you waiting for?
THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON!!!!!

Thank you.  Send in the Comfort now.
Yes, Thank you our family need help now, one has been on bed rest 8 months pregnant needs help. Are now out of food. All are Desperate.
Just know there are folks who are blowing up the phone lines trying to get you help! Keep holding on! We haven't forgotten about you! 
The world could use it.
The Commander and Chief is too busy picking a fight with NFL and NBA players.
Can't we send a big ship and evacuate them???
FINALLY someone takes action to help American Citizens

Our President can’t be bothered b/c he’d rather Poop Tweet about the NFL
This should be the priority right now.  This and possible war with N. Korea. Not #GrahamCassidy or the #NFL.
thanks for being my Senator
And the POTUS is worrying about the @nfl @NBA and nascar
Thank you so much sir! I'm proud that you represent me here in Florida.
Thank you!
Thank you!
When???

One tweet and no action. Big deal! Meanwhile trump is obsessing over NFL. No excuse for that!
He's disgraceful. Hate this guy. As a president or a small person.
Great, how about you call and @potus and see if he'll actually do it
HE ALREADY DID!!!
Thank you sir!!
Thank you, also vote no on Graham-Cassidy, listen to the people, not to the billionaires
I thought that was why legislation is called Bill-ionaires??
And US virgin Islands!!!
Don't call the president - he's too busy obsessing over the NFL and ratings to worry about such "trivialities". #MondayMotivaton
Thank you. The White House is clearly preoccupied.
Yes!!!!  Is @realDonaldTrump even alert to this need?  Or is he still laser focused on the @NFL?  Trump needs to put human life before NFL!
“are you ready for some football (tweets)?”—@potus
It hit a week ago
@TEXSAR1 is ready to help Senator
Thank you, Senator. Please keep speaking out for our citizens who lack representation in the senate.
You and I don't always see eye to eye, but thank you for stepping up where @POTUS has not. #PuertoRicansAreAmericans
And The U.S. Virgin Islands
You're out of luck if Dolphins #TakeAKnee.
Bring water, food, and fuel! 
Not just call for Sir. Make this happen today. These Americans are w/out food,water,medicine. It can't wait any longer!! TODAY! ACT NOW!
Thank you Senator.
What is being done to help St Croix as well?  I have friends living there - power expected to be out 6 months.  Supplies are dwindling!
Thank you for this! I hope others follow suit.
Thank you, Bill. Those are our citizens in dire straits.
Remember this all next year Florida. Senate seat will be up for grabs.
Thank you senator. And where is the president?
On twitter of course.
Why don't you go help Bill?
If U,family,or friends are getting  or expecting to get help from America here in states or any of the Island destroyed need to stand for
Thank you, Sen. Nelson, for your leadership.
Where's the Navy flotilla 4 these Americans? The Marines? A disaster & recovery plan? Royal Caribbean CRUISE LINE supplying generators! WTF
Follow @fema and @NoradNorthcom Some help already there. More coming. Hurricane path made it harder for ships
Good to know but not enough Coast Guard decentralized, most flexible branch
That’s leadership....
Please. ASAP.
Thank you.
Thank you for showing compassion  & leadership for the folks in Puerto Rico & neighboring Caribbean islands. #PuertoRicoHurricaneDisaster
TK U
Thank you!
Thank you Senator.  Puerto Rico needs much more attention from US.
Why has this not happened already?
Thank you sir for looking out for you fellow Americans, have your colleagues speak out, they have no voice over there except ours right now
Thank you Senator! Time of the essence in order to avoid massive humanitarian crisis
Thanks. Corp of Engineers would be good too. Too bad the president is obsessed with nationalistic pandering.
Thank you so much!
Where is the absent @potus?
Thank you, senator
What is taking so long
But there are people refusing to stand for the national anthem.

And USVI!!! Still in desperate need of basic supplies!!
We need more emphasis on Maria destroying PR and the Virgin Islands! TY Bill
Thank you
I am* not 'Am calling...'
Thank you, @SenBillNelson !
