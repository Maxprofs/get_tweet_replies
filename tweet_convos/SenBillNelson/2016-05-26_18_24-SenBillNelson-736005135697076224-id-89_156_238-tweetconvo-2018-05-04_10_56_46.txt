Donald Trump is the biggest popular vote loser in history to ever to call himself President-Elect please be our voice !
@WeinfeldRuth @guardian
@Bencjacobs And people have to have money & jobs to be able to live... & travel is the cherry on top!
@guardian @realDonaldTrump @P0TUSTrump The PIPELINE will NOT make America great again!
And the reefs and marine life in Biscayne National Park can't thrive without a preserve.
.@SenBillNelson Do not forget Trumps objectives.
THEY CANT LIVE WITH YOU VOTING IN FAVOR OF SANCTUARY CITIES! THIS MAN IS A TRAITOR! VOTE OUT
the XL pipeline doesn't come to florida, I live in orlando, and we need to remove the Middle east from the equation
Bill  -- STOP  -- Embarrassing Florida With Your Stupidity. . . .

Ah, yes they can.  The rigs will be 30 miles away from the beach and won't be seen.
: I agree Florida will lose it's beautiful beaches and tourism if the oil companies come in,@Rightklick2
@Leslieannscott @Bencjacobs Sure they can.
@LashaWells @Bencjacobs this jerk cannot be president#environmental disaster!
.@SenBillNelson We've had an Alaskan pipeline since the 70s. I don't recall any issues, do you? More Liberal logic.
right you are!
How do you get to Florida as a tourist if you don't use oil drilled from the ground?
@guardian People can't get to Florida without gas. Also without jobs it's kind of hard to go on vacation to Florida.
The keystone pipeline is not going through Florida. Stop the partisan scare tactic nonsense. @SenBillNelson
.@SenBillNelson Will you #StandWithJohnLewis and boycott the inauguration?
@Bencjacobs Vote For @realDonaldTrump at least he does not lie under oath.
#climate #nature #Potus #Sanders #Clinton #DNC #Trump #Nevertrump #wildlife
@guardian agreed Bill.
#climate #nature #Potus #Sanders #Clinton #DNC #wildlife
U wouldn't even see the rigs from the beach.  why do U hate energy independence (for U.S.) so much? not enough gov pwr&cntrl?
but it's ok for us to unknowingly eat GMO food?? I lost all respect for you. Enjoy Monsanto's money.
@Bencjacobs agreed! Now if you can undo all the damage from #GovVoldemort - that would be great.
@Bencjacobs @marcorubio 
What  are you doing to correct the FL ER now? Mirror the BP cleanup?
@ScottforFlorida
@Bencjacobs stop the algae problem permanently! Hold those responsible accountable!! #tiredofbeingsnowedwithbs
Talk is cheap. #Stuart FL coastal economy can't coexist w/ #toxicalgae & unresponsive politicians. #truth #bullsugar
@guardian the rest of the gulf coast states don't seem to have that problem!
again... not true... It would be nice to be able to trust democrats, instead of knowing that what they say is a lie.
or fracking in our state. Fracking poisons the water & causes earthquakes.  @Bencjacobs
It does in Texas of the Galveston coast...
Keystone Pipeline is a safer more Eco-friendly way to transport oil rather than rail or tanker, so why the opposition? PC?
@guardian BS Galveston has drill rigs just off the coast with no effect.
@Bencjacobs You guys are heroes! Role-models for every #millenial on how to take swift-legislative action!
@Bencjacobs and what are you doing to tell @CharlieBakerMA, Who inherently DISAGREES? What about you @SenWarren
<<- VOTED 4 OBAMACARE AND PROBABLY HAS NO CLUE WHY ??  AS STUPID AS THEY MAKE THEM !! 
#SENILE
<< NURSING HOME FOR THIS OLD FOOL - FLORIDA THINKS HE SUCKS !! 

WE WANT TRUMP !!
<<< AND THIS OLD FOOL IS READY FOR THE NURSING HOME - A PUPPET FOR THE DEMS AND USELESS FOR FLORIDA
= USELESS FOOL !!
THE DEMS TELL HIM HOW TO VOTE - HE IS TOO STUPID TO THINK ON HIS OWN - TIME FOR THE NURSING HOME - OLD MAN
perhaps Obama allowing CAIR to influence the FBIs process to not profile is the culprit.
Potus & slick Willie @HillaryClinton have it wrong! Blaming guns in lieu of radical Islam! @realDonaldTrump pls clean house!
@guardian Senator, terrorists are not INSPIRED. wrong words choice. Inspirayion is from spirit of love.INSTIGATION from evil.
@guardian agreed, get them down @GovernorBentley our coast looks like a scene out of Waterworld
@guardian We need Trump!!!!

@guardian and liberal socialists like yourself don't coexist with anyone. Why not provide a real solution instead of whining?
@guardian OK.If he isn't an environmentalist,is he devil?He loves Russia.I love him.But we should show him what nature means
@guardian Let me breathe in..@realDonaldTrump Are U an environmentalist?
doesn't really care he's just covering his butt so he can get re-elected in 2018. Nelson doesn't have any morals.
Bill, if Obama said sh-t.  You would be the first one to ask what color.  Obama is against any viable energy source.
@FlaDems @Bencjacobs as a Floridian I'm against drilling off our coast if oil leak would decimate our economy
@Bencjacobs So tell me why Louisiana should provide your state with gasoline.
@Bencjacobs Trump idea, is to drill more wells & increase coal mining. Our environment is worth  more than these jobs.
State Department review says that Keystone won't do significant damage.
the issue Keystone creates only 50 jobs,oil is the lowest quality, no benefit to America,
@guardian ..not all like spray on tans or tanning beds.. Sunshine in moderation. #RacingExtinction
@guardian Well, Senator Nelson let's promote voting in Florida stronger than ever. It is crucial for our survival #Hillary
boo on that Hillary part #nocelery #bernieorbust #writehimin #getmoneyoutofpolitics
But it's okay to ruin the gulf beaches by letting water out of the Okeechobee?
as long as he closes Family Law & prosecutes Parental Alienation.
