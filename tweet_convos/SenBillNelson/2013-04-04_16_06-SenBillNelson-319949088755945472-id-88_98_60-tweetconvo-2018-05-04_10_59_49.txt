@SenBillNelson Sorry Sir, you are wrong=ROMANS 1:26-27 THE BIBLE. #CCOT #PJNET #FLACOT @Senate_GOPs #Godislove @Lillibees_mom @podod12
@SenBillNelson #benghazigate is still awaiting a Special Committee w/subpoena powers. Stop stalling & get busy!
@SenBillNelson If you want to support Gay marriage, be my guest but don't mis-quote God, read Romans 1:27, God does not make homosexuals.
Thank you, @SenBillNelson for taking a stand: http://bit.ly/11ty88A  for being on the #RightSideOfHistory & making us PROUD! #NASAAstronaut
@SenBillNelson Excuse me? U mean to say same sex marriage is right?  You're redefining marriage!
@SenBillNelson Really?  That wasn't always your opinion....Barac get to you?
@SenBillNelson God loves all of us but He condemns homosexual acts in the Bible. What next, polygamy and beastiality seek approval?
@SenBillNelson Disappointed in your vote on more gun control.  I will remember that if you run for office in the future.
@SenBillNelson 
You should stand for what is morally right not what people say.
@SenBillNelson No Sir, You are wrong! Read your Bible. Turn back to your roots. May God bless you.
@SenBillNelson You're a good man Senator Bill Nelson and a good American. This is America where we all have equal right!
@SenBillNelson thank you
@SenBillNelson Great! So you'll push to include same sex couples in immigration reform?
@SenBillNelson Are you promoting deviant behavior?Sodomy NY,classB Felony)  Penal Law 130.50(1) (on or after Feb 1, 2001)This is wrong sir.
@SenBillNelson How is it wrong when most states still have ANTI sodomy laws on the books? Are you saying that sodomy is ok?
@SenBillNelson I can't wait to vote you out in 2016
@SenBillNelson I agree - constitution ensures rights of all and must be followed. Religious beliefs belong in houses of worship.
Amazing, a person can change a life belief for a vote. You are elected to represent, not to see how long you can be elected. @SenBillNelson
@SenBillNelson Good for you Senator Nelson. You are on the right side of history!
@SenBillNelson Read your Bible, Bill.  God condemns it!  Remember Sodom and Gomorrah?????
@SenBillNelson THANK YOU!  From one straight ally to another, every voice added for equality makes a difference.  So proud of my senator!

@SenBillNelson thank you, Senator Nelson
@SenBillNelson well done.
@SenBillNelson    Thank You!  for coming around and explaining this!!!
@SenBillNelson maybe so. But less wrong than banning something protected by the bill of rights. #2ndamendment  THAT might be treason.

Another one. RT @SenBillNelson: Ban on gay marriage is wrong.
@SenBillNelson as a constituent, a supporter, and a gay male, I think it's about time you said so.
