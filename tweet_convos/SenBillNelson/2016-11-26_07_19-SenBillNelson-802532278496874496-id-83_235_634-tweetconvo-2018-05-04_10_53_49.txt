Why don't we start here in thr US first. North Carolina would do just fine.
but Ur citizen Ryan Lochte has been killing me for 3d year without any human relation,just a wicked beast.
ow time to look into Usmma and facts. Not what sec fox and MARAD chip are telling you. Check into LMI $400k fake study
You mean like healthcare and education?

is it all? Ur Embassy hasn't given me Visa 2times,but has taken money
Let's start at home. Flint still has poisoned water and our native Americans are being screwed over again #NoDAPL
@jaketapper we don't have all basic rights and freedoms. U.S. should look after those at home first and stay out of it
education 100% subsidized  meaning that Cuban students at ALL levels can attend school for free
I know. It's fabulous
be healthy.Raul is much better than All Ur government.
I don't understand about what rights & freedom U told...I was in Cuba.talked to people there.Nobody has killed.
The same way you supported Amateur Radio Operators by voting AGAINST us? #AntennasAreNotCriminal
u supported a two time loser Benghazi Killary.. It's time u retire since u did nothing 4 Florida! Ur a Fed parasite! #Veteran
we should but we need to fight for that here in the United States as well
Perhaps they can have all the ones soon to be taken away from Americans.
we still have democrats ... just as bad!!
Best way to do that is thru normal relations with Cuba. We know our past efforts have hurt the Cuban people.
Fidel may be gone, but we have Trump and fascist Bannon with their tiny, dirty hands in our government! Do something!#impeach
Yeh. And get him to stop providing health care like the US model. Another failed democracy like us?
I've Always said, an American sitting, having coffee in an outdoor market is the Best Way to Promote Democracy. #freedom
Trump is hot on the path to deny 1st Amendment protection in the US. Pls stand up for the constitution
Saw u on MTP Daily - so nice to see politician with rational approach to Cuba
American ideology to ruin their wonderful culture & lifestyle! Mind your screwed up ethnocentrism without imposing on others!
Cuban people are much happier & cause Castro left Cuba with free healthcare, schools, and stress free life, they don't need/1
let's work on our own country.
you should be starting in this country first.....
we need to support the rights of our Native American people in North Dakota first
@jaketapper meanwhile Trump is working with furnace building companies. We need to be on full alert at home
.@SenBillNelson Then, can we count on you to support @CoryBooker 's call for investigation of human right violations at #StandingRock ?
but the US doesn't even do this so how would they be in a position to tell someone else to do so?
Sure. Can we wait at least until they bury the guy, though?  I mean, show some fucking respect.
@jaketapper I don't think we can say much since we have natives being brutalized and Flint still with poisoned water.
Can we also do this for all Americans?
Please help preserve *our* rights and freedoms under Trump
Now Fidel is dead, US will stop protecting 1965Voting&1964Civil RightsActs, as fear of Fidel forced JimCrow to permit passage
Now that Fidel&JimCrow fear is dead, chance of ending ongoing tyranny over DC citizens under USCongress is even less likely.
so USCongress will keep banning all free&fair actual legislature elections for fully Fed taxed DC citizens, Fed, state,&local
Why can't we have nice things like commie's in Cuba? Universal Healthcare, the highest longevity in west, highest literacy?
You see the irony, don't you? #BLackLiverMatter #LoveTrumpsHate #SchooltoPrisonPipeline
how about you work on getting some clean water for flint first before you save the world senator …
how about U.S mind their business and get their OWN home straight. We STILL don't have basic rights here
nothing like getting in late in the game. Maybe you should remind @POTUS
do u really care abt freedom? looked 4 your condemnation of saudi King Abdullah & his oppression. can't find it.
How about rights for the natives in the land of USA? #DAPL
@jaketapper Let's build a Trump Tower in Havana. That'll show them.
Appoint COMMANDER JOHN WELLS AS SECRETARY OF THE VA
The U.S. doesn't even provide basic rights and freedoms to all. How are we going to press them when we don't do it?
work on freedom for our citizens first!  Stop hurting our good Dads!
@jaketapper if there is a problem, first look at yourself for the solution, then and only then look at others.
Start w Cuba & demand it from other nations the US deals with: Africa & the ME need human rights attitude adjustments @SenBillNelson
@jaketapper Let's hold our own new president to that first, shall we?
@jaketapper : Why couldn't  Obama do this? "It's hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head." ~ Sally Kempton
@jaketapper Press hard? How about liberating the island once and for all? #MonroeDoctrineII
why? You all support a home grown dictator who is poised to strip Americans of those rights. Protect America.
@jaketapper yes but unfortunately it will be lost to our new president, a half-whit when it comes to this reasoning.
@jaketapper if only US had a leader capable of that!
hey Bill ask Obama to do the same for #NativeAmerican #NoDAPL
@jaketapper Our basic rights are abt 2be taken away by Trump, let's first fix on d soil differences . He's words America 1st
Let's work on getting everyone rights in the USA. Stop and Frisk should not be allowed to happen or driving while black.
@jaketapper lol. Trumpland should be quiet.
@realDonaldTrump Cuba is not a place to fight for! We the American People want the riots stopped here at home
Forget that, we are waiting for the DEMS to fight trump/GOP including in Florida.
is Mr Nelson going to push for the same at home? Water, health care, education, voting... all shockingly unequal
@MikeRodNews
@jaketapper same for China, Saudi Arabia and Russia?
@jaketapper Basic rights like free education and universal health care for all Cubans?
maybe we can even start yet another war in a new country. @jaketapper
.@SenBillNelson @jaketapper maybe we should close our illegal prison on Cuba where we torture people to kick that off
But Cubans actually support Castro's dictatorship.
@jaketapper the US should press its own government to provide basic rights and freedoms to all.
I'm sure @realDonaldTrump [ Our Greatest President Elect ]
Will Straighten Him Out
@jaketapper Why get involved in Cuba's political issues when in fact we have our own Fascist agenda,we have to deal with!
The Cubans that reside in Cuba seem to be happy as they are if Fidel wronged them would not they say something!
@jaketapper or we should focus on domestic issues like our govt crackdown on #WaterProtectors #NoDAPL #StandWithStandingRock
Agreed.  All the cubans should be free!
