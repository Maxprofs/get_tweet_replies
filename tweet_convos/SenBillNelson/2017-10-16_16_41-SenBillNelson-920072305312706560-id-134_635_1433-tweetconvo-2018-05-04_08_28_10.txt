You are just afraid that folks from Puerto Rico will move to Florida and vote out you and the rest of the GOP.
He is a Democrat.
Fake News!
Sad!

Here's one way to help!
Thank you. I will retweet!
Thanks so much!
Thank you. However, if the Senate has to be told more needs to be done, then there's something wrong with the Senate (& all Govt, POTUS).
Your the best
This is what you were elected to do. To help our citizens and you, sir, are doing just that. Doing your job. Because it's kind & descent.
Actually, it's not his job to have to ask Trump and other GOPrs to DO something.  That he has to is a tragedy.
They should have sent that money to Puerto Rico. This is so wrong. Hell, send that to me. I can barely pay my bills. Not to Nate’s
It starts with having a president that can feel empathy for others.
"We have to act," indeed
Thank you for your representation, wish there were more congressmen like you!!
Like we haven't done enough already! The tourist and light manufacturing alone should have that country self sustainable, absent the crooks!
Turn around and go back to PR
Bill, @thedailybeast has reported there is a Federal ban on pets weighing more than 20lbs from flying out w their families.
Please Help!!
Thank you Senator, I appreciate your encouragement in letting the Administration know more needs to be done.
id like  to see any one if them live without ac in 100 degrees for 1 day!!!  try 4 months!!!
You tell 'em,Bill!
Should have known democrats we have seen that we are they Puerto Rico democrats problem  Tell Truth 
They should be fired at once. Get the priorities straight!  $600k for additional security. This means their tuition is too high.
FL public tuition is 2-3x PR's . Can cost differences be mitigated for our US students migrating to FL from PR- at least short-term? Thanks!
I didn't see this on the news.

Puerto Rico's secretary of state filmed this in a dumpster.. AID thrown away & mishandled & they blame @POTUS 
While you're at it, you need to remove Donald from office: dereliction of duty for willfully ignoring the desperate needs of Americans.
You need to back tax form for the PEOPLE who placed you in the Senate Seat to REPRESENT THEM. FLORIDA FLORIDA FLORIDA. Not any place else !!
Today was a very sad day for Florida. Somebody at UF authorized Richard Spencer, white supremist, white nationalist to speak.
Your full of it cause your a flip flop
I have a number of coworkers with family in PR who say corruption by leftist politicians in PR is biggest problem. Things are difficult, yes

Thank you Senator on behalf of the people in PR that really need help. May God bless you.
Thank you Senator. I hope all others senators do the same and @SeePuertoRico approve unanimously budget for recovery of American island.
Thank you, Senator. I am both your constituent & a native-born Puerto Rican. My heart is broken. Please continue to pressure the Senate.
This is heartbreaking. Thank you Sir for speaking up!
Thank you for carrying the torch for our families in Puerto Rico. They do not deserve to be ignored. Hopefully, you can make a difference
Thank you for advocating for Puerto Rico.
Well said
Thank you sir!
Set up a temporary tent city at each small town with generators etc. Let us know when you get the materials on the ground in Puerto Rico.
What is Trump thinking?They have nothing left,have lost everything.Some don't have any way to get the supplies,food,h20,med's.
Trump treats them like they don't matter.throwing a roll of paper towels @ them.Make him go back down there,for as they have been w/out.
How does Trump think these poor people can get supplies to these cut off areas? They can't.They need HELP.They have been w/out for weeks.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for going to Puerto Rico to see w/your own eyes the catastrophe that has hit our fellow citizens. Thank you for ur report
Sir-everyone knows this...stating the obvious, FOCUS on solutions/solving what “needs to be done” what is the Course of Action.
Much more needs to be done, essentially full voting rights and representation for all  citizens. Thanks for stopping by and please voice our fundamental needs. @generacion51 @lisamurkowski @SenatorReid @SpeakerRyan
Thank you Senator.
Reckless Endangerment-CULPABLE-Morally EVIL
Thank you @SenBillNelson. #Statehood would provide #PuertoRico with the tools for its prompt recovery. They are Americans.
@SenBillNelson gracias
Thank you Senator.  Hope you can join is tomorrow for a #JustRecovery for #PuertoRico.
Register to vote!
Trump has disconnected from PR.His base is ok with it.A respected Repub member need to take on Trump. We need action not more dam speeches !
Good luck!
So with you saying that have you not seen Americans here in the states with your own eyes?
Thank You Senator...
Thank you Sen. Nelson.  Please continue to speak out
Thank you Mr. Nelson. We are very grateful people and grateful for all of the help. God bless you.
Thank you, Senator!
Hello! Is anybody listening or are you playing yo an empty house?
and the US spends how much on defence? And they can't spare the $ to rescue there own citizens? It's criminal
Did you have a chance 2c the damage2 the U. S. Virgin Islands? I heard some reports that their needs are just as great. Both need our help.
Is this a plea for the benefit of PR or to keep Puerto Rican’s leaving the island from flooding Florida?
Thank you.
Thanks for staying the obvious, when instead you need to name Trump and hold him accountable.
Thank you!!!
Did you see your fellow Democrats blocking all the help
Thank you
Thank you Sir #PuertoRico  @DavidBegnaud @POTUS @CBS @nbc @CNN
That "more" is giving Puerto Rico the responsibilities and rights that statehood brings.
Thank you @SenBillNelson for speaking up to those crooks
Thank you so much. We are doing all that we can, but without power, water, food, is not that easy. So any help is very welcome. Thank you! 
Who paid for that trip?
Ok. So now can you help Floridians by getting rid of the horrible #obamacare? Maybe some tax relief? I mean, if you have time...
Wow ...im nominating you for sainthood
Thank you Senator!
So keep their people there to rebuild
Thanks Bill, as always. 
Thank you!
Funny that the PR representatives say that everything has been done that can be. I think you need replaced!!!!!
How about staying in DC and doing what you was elected to do represent the people of Florida, you haven't done crap for the working class
Thank you ! Puerto Rican's are suffering - and this needs addressed ASAP. I can't imagine what they are going through.
Why is Donald Trump Lying about the status of need in Puerto Rico? What does he think he has to gain? Puerto Rican's Vote and there R many!
Thank you for visiting & speaking up! Thank you for caring & having a heart
Thank you @SenBillNelson  I pray that the senators listen to you #PuertoRico
Then had a long lunch and played golf with some lobbyists
You guys didn't think he gives a damn about anyone else, did you?
With all due respect, Senator, many Americans have been saying this for weeks now.
Thank you!
Thank You !!!
So glad you went to see for yourself. Am sure you did not bring #papertowels Stay in the #Senate  #Florida needs #SANITY
Senator, why don’t you tell FEMA & the military exactly what that more entails. I’m sure they are waiting to hear your specific solutions
Florida's great Senator. Working for those in peril whether hurricane, healthcare, education or a decent salary. Thank you.
Thank you, Sen Nelson for remembering our fellow Americans that are struggling in PR.
Thank you! Proud to have you as my Senator.
Thank you!
Thank you Senator Nelson. Someone has to speak up for & do something for PR. POTUS is prejudiced against people of PR..everyone knows it.Sad
And what was their response?
Hey billy, take care of FL. The Wonderful Mayor of San Juan can take care of PR! If you don’t believe me, ask her!!! LMAO
No prob Doug, and next time an Ivan or a Charlie or an Andrew come calling. Well just cross you off the list for federal aid. Selfish.
Sounds good to me! I’ve been a quadriplegic for 13 years. I take care of me. I broke my neck, my fault. It’s time people quit whining!
who’s whining now?
LMAO... there’s no whining sweetheart!
Keep that sense of humor. You’ll need it with the Medicaid cuts headed your way. Babycakes.
What makes you think I’m on Medicaid?
Thank you for representing your constituents so well.
The citizens of Puerto Rico are his constituents?
@LeChat#RESIST, TWEET,DELETE,BLOCK.HA HA HA COWARD! TYPICAL CHILDISH LIBERAL NONSENSE !
Thank you for doing your best for these, and all Americans.
We all know that. Now how about voting on healthcare, tax reforms, etc? You ‘do nothings’ in Congress talk big and do nothing.
Did anyone listen? Better yet, is anyone going to respond to your request? (I'm a voter that lives in FL.)
Take off your suit and go do it get tour hands dirty
thank you Senator Nelson.   I contributed to your re election campaign today and will continue to do so.  thank you for being our Senator.
Thank you Senator!
Thank you for speaking for the voiceless.
Thank you, Senator.
We know you are the only one in the room & this is PR opportunity only.  Empty words without you telling us how you would fix it.
Thank you Sen Nelson, for keeping this humanitarian crisis a priority. #PuertoRico
Specifically?
Bravo Senator Nelson!!!
And vote against Callista Gingrich?!  Very petty.  Very small.
Hey Billy,
What's it gonna cost us?  Cause I know you're not reaching into your pocket...
Excellent! Now what r YOU proposing 2 help them! We Americans r donating- now we need you all to help too. Keep it up Bill! Follow through.
U tell them about the law youre trying to pass making it a FEDERAL crime for all Puerto Ricans to boycott #Apartheid #israel settlements ?
Proud to have you represent me. @marcorubio? Meh, not so much.
Thank you thank you thank you!!!
Thank you, Senator!
Keep up the GREAT work you are doing Senator Nelson!!!
