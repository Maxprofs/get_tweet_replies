@SenBillNelson I demand proof! As a constituent, I demand absolute proof. Don't flip flop a year from now and say we had bad intel!
@SportsTBFan @senbillnelson Agree! Iraq all over again ?
@lily112146 @SportsTBFan @SenBillNelson Pres. Obama is NOT Bush.He will do what he says, like in Libya.
@lily112146 @SportsTBFan @SenBillNelson Going to congress is a very good thing for democracy, and i support the president for doing so.
@Maggyw519 @lily112146 @SenBillNelson Potus is required to go to Congress.
@SportsTBFan @Maggyw519 @lily112146 @SenBillNelson It won't matter, either way, we are going in.  The system is broken.  It must be derailed
@SenBillNelson : #justsayno The American people are overwhelmingly against military action in #Syria. Listen to your constituents.
@SenBillNelson As an American citizen and voter I would urge our politicians to not drag us into ANOTHER unending war.
@photogtony @senbillnelson Agree! Not our war. Not our people.
@SenBillNelson Please vote NO on #Syria. Let countries in the region deal with it! We need to focus on OUR crumbling schools, roads, bridges
@SenBillNelson #StayOutOfSyria When is the investigation of Benghazi going to become appropriate? #Fail yet again
@SenBillNelson War Monger
@SenBillNelson WE THE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU! Vote for Syria Involvement and you will lose next years elections!
@SenBillNelson Lawyers should decide Syria matter not politicians with respect - laws of evidence are key.Please leave it to ICC.
@SenBillNelson Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said“We want to join convention on prohibition of #chemweapons &observe obligations"
It's unilateral Bill. NO on Syria, NO on cloture @SenBillNelson Re: chemical weapons use, military action with NATO and our regional allies
@SenBillNelson Please no unilateral military intervention.  And we need to wait until the UN inspectors are finished
Dear @SenBillNelson: Do NOT vote on something as unpopular as strikes on #Syria. USA has not been attacked nor have our allies.
Dear @SenBillNelson: Nato not with us. Regional allies not putting money where mouth is. Mission too "fuzzy".Your constituency against!
@SenBillNelson lost me here. 32.000 gun deaths annual in US seems like a bigger atrocity.  Lets deal with our own travesty

@SenBillNelson I do not believe so, and Obama arming rebels who are Al Qaeda is the definition of treason.
@SenBillNelson A war with Syria? Not at this time...The majority are not in favor of this at this time. WAIT!

@SenBillNelson You are wrong. Stop being an Obama lapdog, be an American, honor your oath.
@SenBillNelson - as Senator, oath to uphold the US Constitution. Attacking Syria is a violation: http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=64 …

@SenBillNelson YOUR WRONG, YOU GLOBALIST!
@SenBillNelson The American people demand proof.  A yes vote bloodies the hands of the voter. Are your hands clean senator?  #handsoffsyria
RETHINK! RT @SenBillNelson After chemical weapons use,military action w NATO % our regional allies against Syria's Assad is appropriate.
@SenBillNelson Absolutely opposed to military intervention in Syria - from a NW Florida voter
@SenBillNelson @NancyWonderful thank you sir.  please have your colleagues come on social media and announce they will support.
@SenBillNelson I don't support  any military action in Syria. Obama lies and I don't believe anything he says. I ask you to vote NO!
@SenBillNelson I don't trust the info of who did it, or the opposition. There r other ways around this. Do NOT support. The way will come.
@SenBillNelson DidU readPutin report?Ynot? Nonstd shell=rebels, nonstd detonator=rebels, nonindustrial gradeSarin=rebels. #seanhannity
@SenBillNelson I do not agree - we need to engage with other countries to help Assad understand we all disagree.. save Syrians, don't bomb!
@SenBillNelson Please work in resolving the many issues our once great country is facing.High unemployment.
@SenBillNelson With all due respect it's not in our best interest to get involved in a civil war in support of our enemies.
@SenBillNelson we have seen what these militants are capable of...what makes you think it wasn't the rebels that attacked damascus?
@SenBillNelson Sir i have voted for you in the past, but with your vote to strike #Syria you have lost my support !
@SenBillNelson I wrote to you to urge you not to vote.  You disagree.  You're on the wrong side again. #nomorewar #syria
@SenBillNelson This is not an issue for the United States of America.  Listen to the people who sent you to DC.
@SenBillNelson I don't agree.  This would be a disasterous move!
@SenBillNelson I disagree! Why would u want to support al Qaeda? Protect America! #dontattacksyria #nowarwithsyria #handsoffsyria
@SenBillNelson No, Senator! Reconsider!  This will further endanger minorities like Orthodox Christians, who have lived in Syria for 2K yrs!

@SenBillNelson as your constituent I urge you to vote no on Syria.  Both sides in that war hate us & want us dead!  Stay out!
@SenBillNelson The people don't want this!  I DON'T think there is proof it was Assad! Other countries agree. Represent what the people want
@SenBillNelson Demand al-Assad be brought before the International Criminal Court. US Mil action will only draw us into another conflict.
@SenBillNelson Not our war.  There is no good side in this war. http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/09/04/Syria-rebels-attack-regime-held-Christian-village …
. @SenBillNelson Please reconsider this ill-advised position. Flouting UN, supporting Al Qaeda & hearkening WWIII not in our best interest.
@SenBillNelson No it's not! . if we hit them & they use gas again, THEN WHAT?? Do you want a full fledged war? Are you willing to do that?
@SenBillNelson why don't you listen to the people you claim to represent?  We don't want to be involved in #Syria.
@SenBillNelson where's the proof - how do u know assad used the gas???  NO war   NO war

@SenBillNelson pls sir stand up as an American to help the people of syria
@SenBillNelson Not our country. Not our people. No Direct threat to US. None of our business. Drop humanitarian aid. But not bombs! #Syria
@SenBillNelson So, you say we should kill more women & children to avenge the killing of some women & children?  REAL sensible aren't you?
@SenBillNelson Senator, I urge you to vote against any military action against Syria. This should be a UN issue, not American!
@SenBillNelson FALSE. You misrepresent the common belief of your constituents in FL. Be a representative & vote no.
@SenBillNelson this Florida voter disagrees. Maybe focus on the depleted uranium (chemical weapon) we use in war
@SenBillNelson No support for this - no plan - no end game. We cannot afford an action in Syria. Need to fix issues here first! Do your job.
@SenBillNelson Syrian intervention isn't appropriate if it isn't Constitutional  + 100,000 dead in past 2 yrs there Bill.  DEFUND OBAMACARE
@SenBillNelson The US is not the world's police force. No national security interest. Do not intervene in civil war or changing regimes.
@SenBillNelson :  as a tax paying American living in Florida, I say NO to any military action in Syria!  VOTE ... NO!
@SenBillNelson @PaulaRevera Senator PLEASE apply "Critical THINKING" to the argument!

@SenBillNelson NATOWas Created2ProtectTh MemberNationsInEventOf Attack.80%OfVOTERSAreAgainst Interference.YurConstituentsSay #NoWarWithSyria
@SenBillNelson  no support for military intervention.  Soon as we fire first missile we will be at war, with dreadful consequences. Vote NO.
@SenBillNelson Please don't put us into another war! Of course NATO is going to support military action. That doesn't make it right.
@SenBillNelson You are out of touch with your voters,Out of touch with your nation! Will you lead the front line into #Syria or just vote it
@SenBillNelson I will never vote for you again! We a have no allies. War is not the answer Violence to fight violence is primitive @cnn
@SenBillNelson proper place to adjudicate war crimes is ICJ.  Attack will do no good. Collateral damage devastating.
@SenBillNelson Russia, Iran, Hezbollah should know we are not weak nation.
@SenBillNelson NO !!!  Who are we to alone commit an act of war against another country with no threat to our national security.  Vote no.
@SenBillNelson I agree and feel the president's remarks today were spot on. #syria
@SenBillNelson if you truly believe military action is needed in Syria let the locals handle it, please. Don't drag us in deeper. #Syria
@SenBillNelson Please!  Proof it's a threat to our Ntl security or no military action!

 http://youtu.be/md6jIh9MzHw .
@SenBillNelson And leave the country and the chemicals in who's hands?
@SenBillNelson Both sides of that civil war are our enemies. Remember how helping Bin Laden in the 80s came back to bite us??
@SenBillNelson unless the attack is against the USA military action is NEVER appropriate
Mindless MT @SenBillNelson: After chemical weapons use military action with NATO & our regional allies against Syria's Assad is appropriate.
@SenBillNelson http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/22/israeli-american-company-to-drill-for-oil-in-occupied-golan-heights.html … We are aware of the true motivations

@SenBillNelson NO it is not IF you can't absolutely know Agent Provocateurs aren't ones meddling to destabilize Syrian military #GenieEnergy
@SenBillNelson why was it bad for us to go into Iraq under Bush but OK now? And look how well Egypt turned out. #LearnFromMistakes
@SenBillNelson Folks forget that Mr. Nelson went to Syria for peace before, and that we've done drones+airstrikes without major war.
