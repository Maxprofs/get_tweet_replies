@SenPatRoberts Please honor the U.S. Constitution and Judge Garland's service by considering his nomination. It's your job. It's your duty.
@jenniferkryan - so frustrated with @SenPatRoberts and other Senate Republicans on this issue!
@jeniroo #Kansas leads in political embarrassment at all levels.
. @SenPatRoberts
We did and do have a voice.

We elected President Obama.

Or did you forget how your job works?
@SenPatRoberts 
Americans did have their say when obama elected.  #DoYourJob
@Kayakgal11 @SenPatRoberts And again in 2014 when they gave control of the Senate to the Republicans. #ElectionsHaveConsequences
@SenPatRoberts @Senate_GOPs we used our voice to elect @POTUS. #RespectOurVoice #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts I have a voice. Do your job or resign your office. Preferably resign your office because you suck at your job.
@SenPatRoberts You all have the same robot tweet machine. THE PEOPLE SPOKE IN THE ELECTION!!  Don't try to speak for me!
@SenPatRoberts We already spoke. 3.5 years ago when we voted in @POTUS He's done his job, now it's time for you to do yours.
@SenPatRoberts Haven't heard much on opposing vote on SCOTUS nom? Really? Checked your Facebook page or Twitter or polls lately? #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts We used our voice to elect the current President - twice. #DoYourJob #GiveThePeopleAVoice
@SenPatRoberts
@SenPatRoberts At least 1 KS Senator is brave enough to do his job & publicly vote SCOTUS nom down if he doesn't like the choice #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts We, the People, had a voice in electing this POTUS and you, to BOTH do your jobs!  Not for 3/4 of a term. #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts you can spin this anyway you want any reasonable person sees exactly what you and your party is doing. And you are wrong sir.
@SenPatRoberts how about you and the rest of the old guard retire. Nothing changes under your watch. Only gets worse while you profit.
@SenPatRoberts We used our voice to TWICE elect @BarackObama! He's done his constitutional duty. Now you need to do yours!
#DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts pretty sure @POTUS got elected by the people, so the people already spoke. You're just not listening. #GOPGTFO
@SenPatRoberts #doyourjob
@SenPatRoberts #doyourjob and stop pretending like your interest lies with the American public #obstructionist
@SenPatRoberts The people did have a voice for  #SCOTUSnominee.  3 years ago Obama was reelected.  #doyourjob
@SenPatRoberts people spoke 3.3 and 7.3 years ago ELECTED PRESIDENT OBAMA spoke loud & clear
We did @SenPatRoberts , #SCOTUSnominee we elected a president and a senate.  We & the pres did our jobs.  Check the constitution & do yours!
@SenPatRoberts we already spoke- we chose Obama-do your job! If it was other way around, you'd demand dems to vote! Quit this obstruction!
@SenPatRoberts the people say do your job!! Or better yet retire!!
@SenPatRoberts We agree. Follow our 2012 vote and do your job while you have it.
@SenPatRoberts We voted in Obama not once, but twice because he is far more capable than the so called candidates you keep putting out.
@SenPatRoberts A Marine knows the importance of doing your duty and upholding the Constitution. Now #DoYourJob  #SCOTUSnominee
@SenPatRoberts Hey, Pat, I had to do my job today. All of it! I expect the same of you. #DoYourJob #HoldAHearing
@SenPatRoberts   Qualify 'American People.' Those with beatings hearts and souls?  Or those the SCOTUS, not God, decided "are people too?"
@SenPatRoberts The President we picked is still in office. Unfortunately, so is the inept Senator we reelected. Do your job, for once.
@SenPatRoberts also the PEOPLE have a voice on the nominee when we elected Obama. Learn something about the Constitution
@SenPatRoberts nominee is selfmade man, sold his comics & worked to get thru harvard, tough on crime. Trapped by a perfect #SCOTUSnominee
@SenPatRoberts do your job.
@SenPatRoberts You should have voted in 2012, in whatever state you live in.
.@SenPatRoberts constituent here. We already had our voice when Obama was re-elected for another 4 YR TERM!!
@SenPatRoberts #DoYourJob & vote.
@SenPatRoberts do your job.  Tell your lazy friends to do the same.
@SenPatRoberts my voice is asking you to vote on the nominee
@SenPatRoberts They do! They elected Obama, knowing that this is something the #POTUS does. Speaking of, why don't you do YOUR job?!? #ksleg
@SenPatRoberts DO YOUR JOB.
@SenPatRoberts Not sure why you needed a video to say nearly verbatim what you wrote. But you should do YOUR job - up or down vote.
@SenPatRoberts The American people spoke when they reelected Barack Obama to a 2nd 4 yr term by 5 million votes defeating Romney #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts #Doyourjob, cut the lies. We voted. Don't want to vote on this? Resign!
@SenPatRoberts You are my voice.  President Obama is my voice.  You supported Judge Merrick Garland before, support him now!
@SenPatRoberts

#DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts the American people had their voice when President Obama was elected. Do Your Job.
@SenPatRoberts No, you don't get to make @POTUS a 3/5th President. Knock it off and #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts As a constituent,  i demand you do your job and hold a hearing for the scotus nom.
.@SenPatRoberts Um. Hi. The American people did have a choice. They voted for @POTUS . Twice. #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts I am so fed up with all this party politics - you are the reason people are attracted to Trump -I'm not but I understand
@SenPatRoberts We elect a President every four years. We know the consequences. Do you job! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenPatRoberts I voted for you- do your job. You and the leaders who are acting like this are why I will no longer vote GOP #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts See November 6th, 2012.
@SenPatRoberts how are the people being denied their voice? Using that logic, we should probably stop listening to you.
@SenPatRoberts We do have a voice. President Obama, elected TWICE. Kindly cut the crap and do your job already!
@SenPatRoberts We did our job. Obama did his. NOW DO YOUR JOB.
@senpatroberts We did sir. We voted in BO twice, with a 5 million popular vote threshold
@SenPatRoberts The US people WILL have a voice. A Majority of Americans voted for Pres. Obama and he still has 9 mos left. Stop the BS.
@SenPatRoberts We used our voice when we elected Barack Obama. YOU ARE THE ONE DENYING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEIR VOICE.
@SenPatRoberts Hi Pat! This is the Koch Bros. You are such an obedient puppy! Here is another million$
@SenPatRoberts You are our voice! Do your Job!!!
@SenPatRoberts DO YOUR JOB.
@SenPatRoberts americas voice elected obama by a wide margin.
@SenPatRoberts Oh do grow up. Read the constitution. Do your job.
@SenPatRoberts there are 6 likes but many more people telling you to have a vote. What does that tell you about what your constituents want?
@SenPatRoberts We have had our voice. We elected the President in 2012.
@SenPatRoberts I used mine and voted against you in 2014.  Now do your job, give the nominee an "up or down" vote.  #ksgop
@SenPatRoberts the American people did have a say. They elected this senate and this president. There is a vacancy now...fill it.
@SenPatRoberts they did in Nov 2012. Most people don't expect @potus to do 3/4 of his job. Do your job. #DoYourJob
@SenPatRoberts my voice was heard when I voted for Obama. He is doing his job; now you do yours. #notproudkansan #SCOTUSnominee
@SenPatRoberts @SenPatRoberts  As a constituent I am continually disappointed in your performance. Why doesn't my voice matter?
@SenPatRoberts we had one.  We elected Obama.  He's still the prez
@SenPatRoberts please do the job I elected you to do. Have a hearing and allow an up or down vote. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenPatRoberts do your job Sen.Roberts.  As a constituent im saying we sent you there to do a job required by the constitution.
@nemesiscafe @bettylee1 @SenPatRoberts Congressmen and Senators no longer work for the people. They now work for the donor class.
