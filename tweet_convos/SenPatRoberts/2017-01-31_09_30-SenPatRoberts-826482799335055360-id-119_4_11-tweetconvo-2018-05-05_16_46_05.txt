She wrecked Michigan public system. #NoBetsyDevos
maybe she could help fund r schools by setting up a pyramid scheme, u know, Amway style. You're such a follower.
Don't trust anyone linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6MwGeOm8iI …
@JerryMoran Please vote NO @BetsyDeVos Billionaire status is no qualification. #Unqualified  #noPayforPlay
I prefer my Secretaries of Education understand what plagiarism is.
As you cast that confirmation vote, I pray that you will consider KS Teachers & students OVER your party! Vote NO!!!!
If you care at all about children in the public education system you will vote NO. LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS!
we need a Sec of Ed with experience in public ed who supports it! Vote no and let's start over w qualified cand.
disappointed. Kids deserve Sec of Ed who is advocate of public ed! I'm  a constituent! I contacted you!
please listen to your constituents. Vote No on DeVos. She is woefully unprepared for this task. #VoteNoDevos
You are part of the swamp Trump will drain!  Nothing but a blood bag that sucks the life out Washington & KS.
Vote no on Betsy DeVos. You know it is not the right thing for our schools.
Please vote No on Besty DeVos. Need somebody with public school and experience.  No to DeVos!
.@SenPatRoberts Please vote NO on the appointment of Betsy DeVos. She's not good for Kansas public schools.
I'm very disappointed in you and your vote for DeVos.  Please start listening to your constituents!  >:-(
please talk to us (constituents) re: ignoring us. Tell us the tally of phone calls re: @BetsyDeVos. You rep us not GOP
so I guess you don't listen to the people of Kansas who you actually work for.  How arrogant of you.
if you truly care about education you will vote no. Money =/= ability.
in order to enforce and implement IDEA you have to understand it.  Your vote for DeVos is a vote against KS.
Please listen to your constituents & vote no on DeVos. She supports business, not public education. - A Registered Kansan
vote NO on Devos. Your constituents (u know the people u "represent" and who vote) have valid concerns. She's not qualified
I assume you aren't running for re-election in 2018 & only care about the donations  @BetsyDeVos made to you. Pathetic.
, please do what your constituents want and vote NO on @BetsyDeVos #unqualified
vote no on Betsy DeVos. SPEAK FOR US.
as usual, you're not listening to  people of KS. Let's see tally from phone, twitter, FB and email.
Please oppose Betsy DeVos, America's students and teachers deserve better. (I used to live in Shawnee, KS)
Entitled busybody w/boatloads of money that she handed out to GOP. ONLY reason she was nominated. #NoBetsyDevos
Completely unqualified & inept. She is an insult to every educational professional in this country. #NoBetsyDevos
Please do not betray the current and future students of Kansas.  Do Not Support Betsy.  Students are just as vital as wheat.
WOW, can't believe I voted for you.  You obviously aren't listening to your constituents. #VoteNo #shehasNoIDEA
Money chosen over the future of our children... Very sad. But JoCo will remember this in the next election!
Judging by the comments on twitter, FB, & news sources, your not representing the people of Kansas? Who are you representing?
its fairly obvious that no representives of KS actually care what the people think.

Not the right candidate for this job!!! Please vote no! Do not confirm her!
I mean seriously, ignoring your constituents cannot be a good re-election strategy.
Unbelievable. You are losing voters on this one for sure.
Your vote  makes it clear you are in DC to line your pockets.  Your constituents deserve better representation. Shame on you!
You're up for re-election next year @SenPatRoberts. I don't think this is going to help get my vote. #disappointed.
support her is an abomination. She has most brilliantly proved herself the most ill equipped choice possible.
tremendously disappointed in this vote on behalf of Kansas kids. Rural ed does not privatize well. You blew it.
I'm disappointed in you, sir. I thought you were better than this.
.@SenPatRoberts You owe Kansans 30 hours of debate over @BetsyDeVos on the senate floor to convince us she's qualified for the job.
.@SenPatRoberts This constituent is very disappointed by your vote for @BetsyDeVos. Her ignorance on federal civil rights laws is dangerous.
Yes to DeVos is an awful choice. Shame on you, @SenPatRoberts - you're supposed to speak for your constituents. Kansas parents won't forget.
listen to your constituents, public educators, anyone with children in public school. It's not too late to listen
Imagine that...not listening to the people of Kansas.
.@SenPatRoberts VOTE NO on  @BetsyDeVos #RepublicanParentsAgainstDEVOS say #StopDataMiningOurKidsForProfit http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?ca=ca0436d7-61c3-4c8c-9d8d-73c94a9174c3&preview=true&m=1104610489842&id=preview …
This is why people don't bother contacting their senators. Clearly you do not listen. Always party before principles. Sad.
Devos = unqualified. Did you first clarify what IDEA was before securing her commitment to it? Disgraceful.
- please. Vote no on her confirmation. And maybe have an aide read your twitter feed to you. NONE of us want her.
Obviously the almighty dollar is more important than the children of Kansas. You should be ashamed.
Clear your voicemail so I can call and voice my displeasure, Marine to Marine.
Way to SELL OUT the education of our future generations. No experience and you think she will improve our schools? Get real.
Betsy DeVos will undermine public education.
shame on you and and Betsy DeVos!
Vote NO for @BetsyDeVos! Represent your people. Keep your own opinions out of it-- your people want you to #VotNo
Please vote against @BetsyDeVos. She has no experience in education. Kansas (and America) deserves better #StopDevos #SayNO
Senator, knows nothing about educating children. She is not qualified! Your job is to represent your voters.
Hope you enjoy your last term if this is any indication of how important your constituents' voices are to you. So disappointing.
Please vote against @BetsyDeVos. She has no experience and she has blatant conflicts of interest! Kansas deserves better.
how disappointing. You are not listening to your constituents. This registered Republican is changing parties!
disgraceful 
can't wait for 2018!
please vote no for Betsy DeVos!
There is such a thing as differentiated instruction for all you non-teachers... Not enough qualified teachers is the issue.
I'm disappointed, but not surprised.  Keep following the party line, it's easier than doing the right thing.
what were the numbers for/against DeVos from those who contacted you, the people you are supposed to represent?
You will be judged for this. But our kids will pay the price. How do you look in the mirror? #forshame
, you embarrass us.
why don't you release the stats from constituents who have contacted your office...did your vote represent them?
I am your constituent and I am so disappointed.
I am disappointed in your support of @BetsyDeVos. You ignored constituent calls this week, but wont ignore votes in 2018!
recieved poli donations from @BetsyDeVos. Roberts you failed to listen to your constiuents, only your pocketbook!
so @BetsyDeVos understands what IDEA is now? Disappointed in your vote.
Shame on you for electing this completely incompetent person for the job!!
Grow a pair and listen to your constituents. We DON'T want Devos. She is not qualified nor good for our schools!
- How can you sleep at night knowing you voted against the people that you represent? You are an embarrassment to this state!
I guess this is not surprising to see a lack of ethics from a man who doesn't even live in the state he reps.
The most unqualified candidate for this position ever. Money is power and ethics be damned. Roberts is a fraud.
You didn't listen to a single one of us. Don't whine to us now about the boycott.
Congratulations on your retirement in 2018! Kansas is so in the bag 4 GOP they don't even listen anymore. #ksleg
party over constituents.  We will remember.
Curious, @SenPatRoberts what the tally for/against @BetsyDeVos was from your constituents. Please vote against her in the full Senate.
When can we see that tally, Senator? You are supposed to work for your constituents!
Looks like replies here are UNANIMOUS, Senator. Looks like the Koch's win again. Sorry Kansans.
Your phone mailbox is full. I am very disgusted that you would support @BetsyDeVos as Secretary of Education.
Are you proud? You just help to destroy public schools in America.  Shame on you.
Ashamed of you both.
Wait until the last minute to release a statement, very bold! If you won't answer your phone maybe we just need to come visit
Shame on you sir. You will be held accountable. You are not listening. You have betrayed KS public schools.
So the third Senator from Virginia let's us down again.
that is very unfortunate.
, have you asked your kids if they would want #DeVos teach your grand kids?  #Fail
Please vote no on Mrs. DeVos on her confirmation when the vote goes to the full senate.  She is not qualified.
Add my voice to the unanimous cry of your constituents to say NO to Devos.
you fool!

History will remember you as a tool of the most corrupt administration to ever stain our country.
.@SenPatRoberts I found the problem! Your phone wasn't plugged in!
disappointed
What makes you think she'll support IDEA? When questioned, she didn't know it was a federal civil rights law.
Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.
May as well put former Miss Teen South Carolina in that job if that's your feeling --
