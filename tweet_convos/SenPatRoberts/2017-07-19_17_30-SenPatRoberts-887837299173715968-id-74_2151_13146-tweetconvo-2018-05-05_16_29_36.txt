Much love, healing and peace to @SenJohnMcCain
@SenJohnMcCain 's mother wasn/t a bitch but a consummate tough, elegant, intelligent & classy broad as well as a lovely lady and matriarch.

which is tougher a $2 steak or a boiled owl? #askingforafriend
i want to know where you can get a $2 steak
$1 extra for ketchup.
My God he really has tried to sell everything.
He didn't create billions of dollars in wealth over the years by sitting around, thara for sure
He's an expert @ taking dad's business/political contacts & huge inheritance & running it into the ground b4 getting propped back up by RU $
But not too soon.
He has faced tougher foes. It takes a lot of courage to be a Naval Aviator. To face AAA and Sam's. He will face cancer with the same resolve
I don't know, this is pretty artful. He's an American hero, all politics aside, and I wish him comfort and no $2 steaks!
Love your lingo 
John Dingell           all the best to @SenJohnMcCain
He's a war monger that has a throne of blood waiting for him in hell.

@CodyHettich this is great too
Never change, @JohnDingell. I <3 you.
Ditto...what she said
Third. Your tweets make my day.
I was born and lived in MI most of my life. @JohnDingell is truly aces!   
Cut the tumor out and get back to work @SenJohnMcCain
A great example of putting disagreements aside & putting compassion 1st! We love you, @JohnDingell ! Wishing the best for @SenJohnMcCain !
Tell your friend @SenJohnMcCain that we are all ROOTING for him & Best Wishes to his Family. 
@JRsBBQ like your line getting ripped here?
He's been through hell and back. And hell lost.
Amen and well said!
Lol
If you team up, you could do a whacky travel show ala Better Late than Never sans @WilliamShatner
Mr. McCain will see to that I'm sure.
Your tweets always make me smile. xo
to bad he doesnt give Americans the same respect & healthcare he receives He should be ashamed that his life is saved but others will die
I shall retweet this for a week! I love it!
Very nice sentiment
Amazing post. You win! We are all pulling for you, Senator!!!
This tweet is amazing. I'm sure you got a chuckle out of #SenJohnMcCain
Tougher than a $2 steak! I love it.
Wishing him well John.
Tougher than a Trump steak.
I doubt you're his friend. His "health"care bill he wants to enact wants you dead.

Well said.  All the best to @SenJohnMcCain
Keep trying to convince him keep the  ACA...I hope Sen McCain realizes his Mayo Clinic care is paid for by taxpayers with no insurance...
Well said sir

If you’re thinking about suicide, are worried about a friend or loved one, or would like emotional support, the Lifeline network is availabl
Well said sir. Give him Michigans best.
Stayed in politics too long. America needs to tell it's politicians to retire earlier.
a little dull though in the @SarahPalinUSA department.
Rep Dingell - your respectful tweet belies your usual aching partisanship. Always a start at 90+! Cheers to you! And prayers to Sen. McCain.
"Tougher than a $2 steak." LMAO. 
You guys seem to be the last of a breed - politically diametrically opposed, but able to be friends, to find humanity in one another. 
Why isn't there a sad option..no one wants to Like this
@sshadegg best description of Sen. McCain!
And medical science is advancing every day, including new cancer treatments.

If anyone can beat this, a former POW can.
Sounds like a smokin' good time
"sharp as hell" but he called comey "president"
He had a brain tumor. That is one of the symptoms.
So if I blurt out "President Comey, what was the content of the memos you wrote" one day I'll know I have a tumor?
Maybe. Maybe you have another neurological condition. Maybe you're intoxicated or tired or old. Nobody guessed McCain had a tumor that day.
Anyway, I would trust Democrat Dingell's opinion of him, since he knows him.
Hope he recovers - tell him to get back to DC and beat the crap out of Trump and his minions.
You are both amazing, honorable men.
Please send him our best, love America.
Prayers UP !
Watch what you're wishing for John.
.75 cent steak...
Let's hope he has one more fight in him
.@SenJohnMcCain 's diagnosis is a tragedy for the Republic he has served his entire adult life.
Can you two run on an unprecedented bipartisan ticket in 2020 and fix this mess? D.C. is swampier than ever.
Hope he recovers and spends as much time as possible at home with loved ones
Also hates poor people and is a war criminal.
wish him the best for his health, glioblastoma multiforme has median one year of survival
