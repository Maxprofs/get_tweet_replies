@KMUW I'm extremely disappointed but not surprised. At all. Maybe you should move back to Kansas or retire?

We expected nothing less OR more from you. You're a disgrace to Kansas
Americans demand an independent investigation. Will you continue to be complicit or will you protect our democracy ?
President Nixon - opps I mean Trump - obstruction of justice.

What are you doing to protect this country from this would-be tyrant???
Now is the time to distance yourself completely from Trump and demand an independent prosecutor. Send Sessions packing as well. Show balls.

the truth will prevail!
So you would have supported Obama firing Comey in October? Doubtful.
Weak - just like you.
Let's agree to disagree... Not just any old SHMOE will do.  No more Trump lackeys and unqualified peeps. #AmberAlert Missing: Ethics

That wins the prize for milquetoast responses. You're done in Kansas. Thank god.
Restoring respect and credibility for the President, Senate, FBI, and DOJ will not come as a result sans an independent prosecutor
Yes AND the appointed of a special counsel that is independent beyond reproach.  Please commit to the dullest of investigations!!
Firing the wrong person, sir. Please peruse Trump's January 27th: https://travelingpoet.net/2017/05/12/the-optics-of-trumps-january-27th/ … #obstructionofjustice #dereliction #FireTrump 
That's nice, but you can't deny how shady the Trump Administration has been and continues to be.. #Nixonian
Party over country, eh?

Trump shouldn't appoint a new FBI Director, nor should the Senate confirm one, until the active FBI investigation of Trump is resolved.
U said something there, Jayhawk. 

Copy and paste response? Not good enough! #CountryOverParty
So now the distinguished Senator defers to the Asst. AG? No congressional oversight needed? What a sad, empty vessel you have become!
He's been Koch owned for so long that he lost his soul years ago. #KSisashamed #doesntliveinKS #kochowned #oldhasbeen #wrongsideofhistory
No confirmation without a Special (independant) Prosecutor. #Treason is in the wind here. America needs answers FIRST, BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE!

Nobody cares what you think. We already know bc you are Koch owned. Shame on you, senator from VA. #afraidtocometoKS #hasbeen #nosoul
Meaningless drivel. Take a stand, Senator- party or country? #Comey #trump
He took a stand a long time ago when he moved out of KS and sold his soul to the Kochs.  He doesn't care about KS. #oldcoot #kochowned
This is a very disappointing take. Frankly I expected more from you sir.
We've come to expect the worst from him & we're never disappointed. #nosoul #doesntliveinKS #kochowned
You still suck Pat!
My question is what is the President trying to hide?
Most Kansan's no longer have any trust in your competence to represent us!
Represent Kansas not your party!
Just say you don't care and move on.
Americans haven't lost trust in FBI. We know the real reason for Trump's firing of Comey. Stop playing politics and hold Trump accountable.
You weak-kneed enabler.. How can you stand by and allow this president to make a mockery of our democracy?  Where's your sense of honor?
Nothing has suffered as much damage to reputation and credibility as the US presidency. Your office comes in close second. #FulfillYourOath
The only thing that needs to be done swiftly is appointing a special prosecutor.
This is a giant nothing burger. You may as well be reciting a phone book.
I Called your office to share my concerns about this investigation, as I know many other constituents have. Please put people over politics
independent investigation requested now please! Thank you!
That's why we need an independent special prosecutor!
Wow, Deputy Atty Gen,ONLY2 WEEKS IN THE POSITION,comes up with this bs. Not buying it Senator,still hiding from town halls? ZERO CREDIBILITY
You should follow him out the door! 
We need a special prosecutor NOW!
The best way to restore trust is to move on? You're an ass.
Party before country.  You are a coward and have no honor.
Quick confirmation of a Repub stooge to protect @realDonaldTrump and the rest of you guys that keep sticking up for him and know better!
What about restoring our confidence in The Presidency?
We need an independent prosecutor. The investigation should not be run by @realDonaldTrump selection to head FBI
you're going to lose 66208 over this.  you're supporting obstruction.
Go back to sleep you fossil
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR!! Senator  Roberts, please, if there's nothing to hide, push for a special prosecutor.
Trump is doing immeasurable damage to the United States of America.
If you stand behind him, you are a traitor to the Republic & its ideals.
Call for an independent investigation or I'll tell all my millenial friends to help vote you out.
Country before party, Sen. Roberts. This has cover-up written all over it.
You are a huge turd.
The ONLY way to restore trust in Congress & our democracy is to appoint an independent, investigative Special Counsel or Committee.
Please retire. Thank you.
Trump just made himself dictator & ur not only ok w tht ur marching us all to Hell w him?!!!! U think Pres is above the law?! SHAMEFUL!!!
You have become a @GOP sellout. Your statement has as much lies as @POTUS 

you need to resign.
Stand up and do what is right and quit letting them feed you the party line.
There needs to be an independent investigation. No ifs, ands or buts.
Weird. Now i have less trust in the FBI because firing the head of an investigation directly interferes with the investigation.
We are all now dumber after reading your statement. The FBI is the only agency doing their job. Your blind support of Trump is disgusting.
I hate you.
Support a special prosecutor NOW. Country before party. My God are you blind or just apathetic?
Show a little backbone for once in your life
And the appointment of a special prosecutor! Put country ahead of politics, @SenPatRoberts
I respectfully disagree. Demand a separate independent commission to look at Trumps ties to Russia. We are in a constitutional crisis, sir.
I'm so ashamed you're my senator. No talent clown.
What a coward. It's all about party over country for you - You are an embarrassment and are now complicit in the #trumprussia cover up
what about an independent investigator? please use checks and balances.
You're abetting treason - support a Special Prosecutor.
That’s not enough, Senator. Demand a special independent prosecutor. We don’t trust the Senate by itself.
Support an independent counsel. Your job and your party's future seat depend on it.
The best way to restore our trust in our #democracy is an #independentcommission & #counsel on #Russia ties and interference.
Unbelievable, why now?  How can Sessions who recused himself on the Russia connection help fire the lead investigator.  This stinks.
unfortunately sir, you seem to be under the influence of agent orange and I no longer trust you to represent me! #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Employees fired by Trump:
Sally Yates
Preet Bharara
James Comey

Employees investigating Trump:
Sally Yates
Preet Bharara
James Comey
You left out Michael Flynn - fired by Trump but not investigating. Rather, still being investigated.
Kansas. Whatever.
Shocked , SHOCKED that you tow the company line. Do you actually have original thoughts?
Not when POTUS will try and nominate someone who will try and shut it down.  Special Prosecutor NOW!
Just admit you'd rather protect Trump and get your tax cuts. Loyal to party and not America's best interest and complicit in the cover-up.
Actually, this carefully worded non-statement is typical of you. Sincerely hope you're replaced, too. Kansas deserves better. America, too.
#TrumpRussiaCoverUp #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Party before People, huh?
There must be an independent investigation of all Russian ties with Trump. You not supporting that makes you #COMPLICIT . Represent Kansas!
@realDonaldTrump decides credibility needs to be restored to FBI on same day subpoenas issued in Russia investigation. Tricky Trump
Sounds like you're just too old and lazy to do the right thing. You make me feel ashamed of Kansas.
Do Kansas, and the country, a favor and resign. You're too old to worry about getting re-elected and too complacent to actually do any good.
You're despicable.
So you stand against America. Now we know for sure.
Kansas has enough problems with the republican tax experiment it's currently running. You clearly have no business in politics.
Company line
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! shame on you for supporting this tyrannical action. We see you and will fire you in the next election
And I suppose it's just a coincidence that now Comey will NOT be testifying before the Sen. Intel. committee tomorrow?
So you'll side with party over country. Enjoy watching your political career become known only for your inability to do the right thing.
Because nothing restores trust like a rushed job and trying to move on so we can forget?
