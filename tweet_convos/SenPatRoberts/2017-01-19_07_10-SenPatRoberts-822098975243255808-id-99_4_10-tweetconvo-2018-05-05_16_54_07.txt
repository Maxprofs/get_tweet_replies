once again,KS looks like a backward state with your childish dig at a fellow senator.  SMH with embarrassment.
your comments were classless and lacking any humor. Uncalled for and unbecoming.
pls TRY to show a modicum of respect for other senators! Your offensive Xanax joke was NOT funny. @SenateDems
It was Valium not Xanax. A little humor couldn't hurt during these tough hearings.
and shame on you. You should apologize to @SenWyden_GSPP and people with mental illness.
You go, Senator Roberts. Someone has to be cordial ,and civil to the men and women,undergoing confirmations.
glad to see someone is fighting for us. Thanks Pat. Democrats set the tone by boycotting our #inauguration
#iNAHguration #Illegitimatepeotus   #BenedictDonald #RussianPuppet
Thanks for offering pill to Wyden. He was so rude to Mnuchin@Sen Wyden@Mnuchin
You are a rude, angry old lady
Here's an idea @SenPatRoberts - giving meds to ppl w/out a rx is against the rules. Also not very funny. But then again, you're GOP, so...
comment about valium, could be seen as trying to dispense prescription w/o a license. You were rude, not funny
Making a joke at the expense of others at a public hearing is disgraceful. All b/c you don't agree. Grow up.
if you guys vote this crook in? Really #partisanchump
Thank you Mr Roberts for keeping it real in the hearings. The republicans are going to try to run over the Dem
got valium in your pocket? Drug screen time?
Yes, drug test all of them before they are paid.
vote no!!
Do u wonder why Congress has an abysmal rating? UR snide, juvenile & drugged out comments demean the process
yes. well done senator. your colleagues were rude2 nominee not letting him answer.
you people are proving just how corrupt the GOP is
Inappropriate behavior is first sign of dementia.
Why are you carrying around valium? It's illegal to give meds to others. Very distasteful joke.
I'll take your Valium! GOP offering free Valium to make it through the next 4 years! #makeamericahighagain 
They really ought to. Just wake me when it's over, after Dump is impeached.
You people are despicable. You're not distinguished. You are complicit with the traitor in chief.
.@senpatroberts @gopsenfinance some Senators still speak for voters. We don't want Wall Street in Govt nor do we want Govt in womens' health
You sold your soul to Satan a long time ago. Nothing to see here.
you think the hearings are a joke?  This impacts American lives. You were insulting today
I say grow up & then realize you should've over 65 years ago. I think you need a drug test yourself.
Oh, I forgot you're a Kansas Kochsucker, mixed allegiances as to who's asspussy you really are these days.
#RussianPuppets
Showing your absolute disrespect for those that actually need valium....You must be proud.
I watched ....he's a bad egg...
Heads up, @SenPatRoberts:  Nobody anywhere thinks you're funny.  You may be the least funny person in the United States. @GOPSenFinance
Senator Roberts must be very anxious & needs Valium 2 get thru his day! Probably got a big pharma donation!
Isn't offering someone a controlled substance, such as Valium, illegal?
.@SenPatRoberts @GOPSenFinance No "pin-prick of humor." No humor at all. Just a prick who's helped bankrupt Kansas while enriching himself.
You do know that you made an illegal offer of Prescription Drugs? Some people would get arrested for that!!!
Good thing @RonWyden is such a gentleman, because if you smarted off to me that way, I would pounded your face
@SenSherrodBrown @RonWyden Tehehe... @SenPatRoberts (R-KS) flying high on Valium during Nomination Hearing #Mnuchin @GOPSenFinance
I thought Roberts died!  Awful POS ... really is.
"Valium" comment proving once again the GOP have sold their soul to big Pharma drug junkie heartland
#munchin. How could you vote for him how do you sleep at might please please  just say nay
good job embarassing "Christian civilization".
Dispensing drugs in a hearing?  Disgusting..no joke..not funny..Sad
Taking Valium because Trump won?
Douche. @SenPatRoberts @GOPSenFinance #Valium
Valium pill? What a disgusting comment. SHAME
#buildtheswamp, party first! disrespectful to your colleague @RonWyden
A VALIUM seems appropriate. Dems have agenda of delay, obstruction and failed policies.
Fix ACA, taxes & JOBS.
"I'm just a little prick in the great wheel of American Fascism," did we get that quote right, Putin-cunt?
#StayClassy Pat
.@SenPatRoberts @GOPSenFinance
.@FoxNews @stevenmnuchin1 @SenatorSessions @SenPatRoberts TIME to ERASE NIXON'S E.O. & THE HYPOCRISY http://bit.ly/2hPuLsU  @CNN @Lawrence 
Pat that was hilarious and you were correct to offer. These ppl are in the midst of hysteria, it's unbecoming.
You have shown complete disrespect to your colleague with that valium comment. Embarrassed for you Pat Roberts
The Valium comment was awesome
Just watched you offer a Valium to a colleague. Try and remember you are a grown man elected to help others.
Roberts, take a valium! Maybe it'll help you remember you work for working Americans and not the super rich who crashed our economy. #toady
Senator, how much money have the Koch brothers contributed to your campaign?

It is exactly this loss of decorum that those of wary of Trump fear -- Get your act together immediately!
Roberts, you are a complete embarrassment to Ks. As a Kansan I am ashamed of U. Sickening you were reelected.
Disgraceful! @SenPatRoberts @GOPSenFinance
You dissed my senator, @RonWyden. You are an unworthy little man. Dorothy would not try to get back to yr KS.
here's your valium  ...
very disrespectful behavior with the Valium comment, Sen Roberts.  This is leadership?
I see you've taken respect lessons from the head of the party! Will u start grabbing "things" too?
Sir, that valium dig was cheap & beneath the dignity of the office u hold but the fish rots from the head so it probably fits. #sad #mnuchin
Call his office.  I did it yesterday when he made a nasty comment. (202) 224-4774
Just called SenatorRoberts office&shared my embarrassment about hisValium remark!
U should be more aggressive to protect the Amer. Ppl. and Planet. After all that is why they voted 4 U.  @GOPSenFinance
I just found out U R telling people 2take a Valium? At a Senate hearing?! Really telling people 2take drugs!? @GOPSenFinance
Really? Take a valium?! How about a little respect for your colleagues or are you already mimicking Trump?
"Load the Swamp"
- You old fogey -you're an embarrassment to Kansas. Time for you to retire to your home in Virginia.
Indeed. Man doesn't even own a home in KS. Rents a room...
-he only returns to Kansas when he's running for reelection. Why didn't he run in VA? Probably couldn't win.
Yep! Man is a disgrace
That was the most disrespectful display I have ever seen by a "lawmaker" in all my years. An insult to us all.
Way to make a fool of yourself, now get in the corner with Lewis
@GOP #WeAreWatching YOU @cspan! STOP partisan politics! We voted 4 U! YOU WORK 4 US! Rushing Noms #NOTOKAY!
Senator Roberts comments were unprofessional and out of line. Disrespectful to the great OR senator @SenPatRoberts @GOPSenFinance
I can't believe what I heard this clown say at this hearing
Senator .... take some Valium, and head back to the rest home.  you're too old to be taken seriously.
