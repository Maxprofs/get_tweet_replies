@SenPatRoberts #LawsNotPrayers
@SenPatRoberts Should I pray for more guns? Or fewer gun laws? #WWJD? Please advise.
@HeadOColettuce @SenPatRoberts pray to keep guns in government hands where they belong! Weapons are for the king's men, not commoners!
.@SenPatRoberts Kansans elected you to represent them not pray for them. Keep your religion separate and try doing what's right for voters.
.@SenPatRoberts P.S. I am a constituent.
@SenPatRoberts we need our mental health system fixed.  the democrats destroyed it along with the aclu.
@SenPatRoberts maybe you should give that $350,000 back to the @NRA. That would show how sympathetic you really are.
@itsweezie @SenPatRoberts @NRA Amen, shalom & inshallah to that !
@SenPatRoberts yep praying will sure un-kill those people
@cdulaney85 @ittakesus @SenPatRoberts good thing the cop with a gun ignored the sign too. Saved a lot of people.
@AtlantaChief oh yeah just like it was a good thing that guy was able to get a ak-47 so easy!
@cdulaney85 Yes because a ban on guns will make them all disappear. Just curious, but how many people do you know own an AK47?
@SenPatRoberts The "senseless act" was enabled only by your senseless policies. You're the murderer.
Please tell us, Senator, what has ever been accomplished by prayer?
Stop praying. Change YOUR mind on gun control.
#Hesston
@SenPatRoberts
@SenPatRoberts words mean nothing. Get off your duff and DO SOMETHING
@SenPatRoberts your ears turn red when you lie.
@SenPatRoberts Prayers ??? Your nothing but a mouthpiece of the NRA and your gun nut constituents !!!!
@SenPatRoberts  Every time this happens we pray.  Can we come up with additional actions that may stop these terror-causing events?
@SenPatRoberts-How about u Pray 4 legislature 2 regulate the gun laws we already have.Or do u think felons & mentally ill should have guns?
@SenPatRoberts Any thoughts on assault rifles in the hands of convicted criminals such as Cedric Ford?
@SenPatRoberts Stop 'praying' and start addressing the real problem: gun control. #guncontrol
@SenPatRoberts #MarchAgainstMONSANTO
@SenPatRoberts it would be such a better world if people practiced random acts of kindness instead of senseless acts of violence.
@SenPatRoberts So what else is new you NRA supporter. 3 days from now another one will occur. Sell those guns senator.
@SenPatRoberts thoughts & prayers are useless.Pass responsible gun safety legislation. Your constituents deserve it. #unsungpandemic #trauma
@SenPatRoberts @Brewkkake
@SenPatRoberts thoughts and prayers and more guns are not the solution and help no one. Do something that matters. #guncontrol #gunviolence
@SenPatRoberts Oh thank goodness for the prayers! Clearly that is all a SENATOR can do to curb gun violence. #GOPGTFO
@SenPatRoberts We do not need more prayers, what we need is action from #congress to try to prevent some of these shootings
@SenPatRoberts @Senate_GOPs  @HouseGOP I don't want your prayers, I want responsible gun laws. God is not an ammosexual.
@SenPatRoberts Thoughts & Prayers are useless here. You conservative clowns can't admit you are wrong and pass meaningful gun laws.
@SenPatRoberts Why bother? Did you see any gods who gave a damn enough to STOP it fro happening as any human would. Impotent god.
@SenPatRoberts If you really want to help, you can start by taking the NRA's dick out of your mouth.
@SenPatRoberts praying...bullshit.
@SenPatRoberts how much does the NRA pay you to suck it's cock?
@SenPatRoberts oh good, #ThoughtsAndPrayers. That'll be super helpful.
@SenPatRoberts If only you had the ability to pass laws that could help to prevent these shootings. Hopefully your NRA check cleared.
@SenPatRoberts #coward
@SenPatRoberts thank you for praying, as your thoughts and prayers have done so much for victims so far.
@SenPatRoberts good to know NRA money (max allowed) can keep you praying for the dead instead of legislating for living. Coward. #America
@SenPatRoberts Are you going to use your position to do something about all this gun violence?
@SenPatRoberts Legislation please. #enough prayers.
@SenPatRoberts Talking to an imaginary friend won't bring these people back to life.
@SenPatRoberts   How about limiting access to firearms?  No safety for any of us until then. #CommonSense
@SenPatRoberts how did praying work out with the 29 other mass shootings since January 1st?
@SenPatRoberts Prayers don't mean a thing, hypocrite! Your message is ridiculous. Leadership against gun ownership is #Courage
@SenPatRoberts yay those magical prayers should make these things go away
@SenPatRoberts PRAYING??!? are you fking kidding me? DO something about guns…do your job.
@SenPatRoberts Stop the NRA! Enough prayers, it's time for action!
@SenPatRoberts wait, does praying mean the same as staring at my toes?
@SenPatRoberts don’t pray, act to reduce gun violence with sensible gun regulations. The blood is in your hands, senator.
@SenPatRoberts As your loved one is slaughtered at work take comfort in thoughts and prayers....my ass
@SenPatRoberts That's all you have is prayers?  Prayers aren't doing ANYTHING for ANYONE.
Kansas @SenPatRoberts calls the #hesston #shooting "senseless" but it makes perfect sense to us! Right, @JerryMoran?
@SenPatRoberts Hypocrite. #Bloodonyourhands.
@SenPatRoberts Pray harder.
@SenPatRoberts you received over 322k from NRA so all you do is "pray" do something to stop gun violence #GunWhore
@SenPatRoberts Your constituents are dying because of the gun policies you support and promote. This is no way to represent their interests.
@SenPatRoberts pass a law, not the check; it's your job!
.@SenPatRoberts You wield something more powerful than thoughts and prayers which could be used to stop this shit: legislative authority.
This is why @govsambrownback and @SenPatRoberts' prayers for #hesston #shooting are grievous to God >> http://bit.ly/PrayerSermon 
@SenPatRoberts Pray all you need to. It's a good thing. But how about paying for all their medical bills too. You should guarantee it.
@blongdabby @SenPatRoberts or at least approve of universal healthcare that WILL cover their injuries due to his and CONGS negligence
@SenPatRoberts you got paid to endorse shooters.  So shut the F CK up
@SenPatRoberts you forgot thoughts...
@SenPatRoberts I pray for your demise
@SenPatRoberts praying is good..sensible gun laws will work better..stop this madness it is killing too many people
Dear Lord,  fuck this guy ---->@SenPatRoberts
Thoughts & prayers are a cop out for inaction by politicians who have ability to reduce future mass killings @darthstar99 @SenPatRoberts
@lawhawk Amen.  And fuck this guy ---> @SenPatRoberts
@SenPatRoberts your prayers are nice but had you voted against guns would have helped more
@SenPatRoberts Prayer, a synonym for blaming an imaginary friend for problems you create and asking them to solve them. Reality.
@SenPatRoberts What does it profit...if someone says he has faith but not have works?...faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
@SenPatRoberts of course you are. It is literally the least you can do, short of nothing at all. Congrats on your heartwarming platitude.
@SenPatRoberts Enjoy that sweet NRA cash.
@SenPatRoberts @igorvolsky  Please pray some more as I do not. I think I'll work to put in place sensible gun laws but what do I know.
@TaraHill5 @SenPatRoberts Amen Tara! Time for action (can still pray while they are acting if they feel the need to be)
@SenPatRoberts Gun Nut Cowards killed 33,000 Americans last year. And all you can do is pray?
@SenPatRoberts can we give us a sensible law that works, thoughts and hope aren't Kevlar coated?
@SenPatRoberts gah! Shut up with the bloody prayers and do something that will actually matter.
@RatedArrrrrr @SenPatRoberts he can't coz he sold his soul to the @NRA
@Jonoblair1 @SenPatRoberts @NRA that I can believe.
@SenPatRoberts @ForPresi 
Pat I am standing Tall and I am Praying In Agreement with You Brother
@SenPatRoberts  How come? It's not like you live in Kansas.
@SenPatRoberts Gee, too bad there wasn't a former Gitmo prisoner to stop him. #POS
@SenPatRoberts Yup.  Prayers.  That should do it.
