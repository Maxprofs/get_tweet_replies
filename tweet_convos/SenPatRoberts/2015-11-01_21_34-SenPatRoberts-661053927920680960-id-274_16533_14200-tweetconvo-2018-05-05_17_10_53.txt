@Royals "world champions" even tho the World Series is just America (I don't like sports and even I know that)
@Royals fluke
@Royals well I lived in Kansas for a year so win?
@Royals, It wasn't just a dream!!!
@Royals I would like to congratulate you on your World Series win. #TakeTheCown

@Royals Congrats from the Yankees!!!
@Royals @FCKansasCity beating a team from another CITY in the same COUNTRY DOESN'T make you a World Champ. You're a National Champ. Big diff
@Royals You guys really made it!

@Royals I want to say something  nice but can't think of anything to say. Good going. Being a #Mets fan can really suck sometimes.
