@Senate_GOPs @lroy479 It's simple: Obama wants our troops killed and the US to be defeated. Has done nothing to show otherwise #ccot #tcot
@Senate_GOPs Pure Bunk!  DOD has it in their Budget; or, can re-allocate; by shifting Money around. Existing Waste in Military, Scandalous!
@Senate_GOPs  Prosecute #MBuhari#Gowon#IBB#Danjuma#OBJ for the slaughter of 3.5Million #Biafrans 1976-70.
@Senate_GOPs A simple 51-vote majority could override any veto threat. Grow a pair!!!!
@Senate_GOPs  Aid for refugee Muslim  insurgents? Only solution is remove him from power. Impeach
@Senate_GOPs @SenTomCotton
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner I liked the part where you explained details about bill and why it's necessary rather than just smear Dems
@Senate_GOPs @SenTomCotton and all of you block every vet bill that comes to the floor. Stop using us as political ammo.  You lie.
@Senate_GOPs U better pass this bill. Let Obama veto this bill THE EVERYONE WILL SEE WHAT WE HAVE FOR A PRESIDENT
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner time to remove all of the cancers on America, starting with the Obamas.
@Senate_GOPs @HorseShort Dear POTUS; Go ahead and make my Day.
Sincerely,
Trump Supporter
P.S. Want to see what an "override" is?
@Senate_GOPs @SteveScalise 
Don't you mean he has to think about giving billions to Pentagon to piss away?
@Senate_GOPs @SenJohnThune Do you think American don't know you have blocked every bill to help Vets?
@Plantflowes @Senate_GOPs @SenJohnThune A-men to that!  GOP now trying to do a Wiesel on the $16 Bil passed last year for Vets. Duplicitous!
@Senate_GOPs

@Senate_GOPs @vinny4462  #WakeUpAmerica
@Senate_GOPs Get this through your thick skulls, Senators; we are not going to send our Kids to Middle East so MIC; can profit immensely!
@Senate_GOPs #NDAA Troops & Vets always get the short end of the stick. Those defending our country deserve better.
@Senate_GOPs Senators:  Do we really need 57, 4/5 Star Generals at One Air-force Base; because, they refuse to Retire?  Salaries are a Ton!
@Senate_GOPs Problem easily solved by Pentagon: Re-allocation!  Fact!  Branches & Depart's have to literally spend Mil/Bil's at end of FY!
@Senate_GOPs Cut the Spin & Lies!  Form a Bi/P Committee and Probe for Waste by Pentagon!  Do we really need 167 Golf Courses around World?
@Senate_GOPs this is untrue.
@Senate_GOPs they love war and defense contractors
@Senate_GOPs So you hang garbage on a bill that should be clean and you expect not to have a Veto? Who is holding the troops hostage?
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner @POTUS of course he is going to veto. It's not part of his agenda to approve anything for our military.
@Senate_GOPs  how more can we as Americans take Damm sure can't take 1 more year we need our troops  taken care of  wake up

@Senate_GOPs
@Senate_GOPs
@Senate_GOPs Whose surprised? Barack Hussein Obama despises our Military, and will do everything to degrade them.
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner just deplorable. You can scratch your head and just say, have you no true regard for our troops, Mr. President?
@Senate_GOPs  Remember the sequester?!?! Military & domestic spending must go up together. Can't do 1 without other. @SenateMajLdr
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner obama is way Anti-military the bastard,why I have more respect for putin than this pussy president
@Senate_GOPs @SenJohnThune Senate has to pass it before POTUS can veto. Where are those appropriations bills??????????
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner to cave in 3-2-1 #worstspeakerever #waronthemiddleclass #spineless #nationaldebt
@Senate_GOPs @SenTomCotton Keep us weak is @POTUS' tactic. #pesidentialwimp
@Senate_GOPs What are you so afraid of? Pass the bill and let POTUS veto. Let him explain why. All decent Americans know he's a liar.

@Senate_GOPs @SenJohnThune This Prez has proven over and over again he has no intention of protecting this country #ImpeachObama
@Senate_GOPs @SenTomCotton impeach the traitor.
@Senate_GOPs @Senate_RPC 
Sort of like Republicans voting against money to help veterans.
Or money to feed the poor.
Or help the homeless.
@Senate_GOPs  Well of course. I would expect nothing else from one who dislikes my country.
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner We NEED a real Commander & Chief! Our Men need Supplies! USA going broke with useless programs!
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner Wow, that's a scary looking avatar. Don't nuke me man!!!
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner We all want the money to make an even stronger military but scrutiny is needed to reduce bureaucracy & waste.
