Going to use the same stock photo every time to SHOW you are on the phone? Why not just a photo of your answering machine?
Are Kansans born in the banned countries true Americans? Do you have their backs at all? Can they ever go see their families?
.@SenPatRoberts Thousands of your constituents went to this FB page as your phones are still busy. You didn't listen to any of us.
as your constituent vote NO on Devos. Please WITHOLD CONSENT.
hello dear how are you doing today
am doing well and what about you too dear

I've called, I've emailed...please do what is right. #VoteNoDevos
@SenPatRoberts we Kansans are not impressed with your unavailability. You work for us, remember?

... and then you hang up and laugh and laugh and vote along party lines regardless.  SMH  Kansas should be ashamed.  I am.

Price has too many conflicts of interest/insider trading to guide healthcare for KS. Please vote no. https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-tom-price-got-privileged-discounted-offer-on-biomedical-stock-company-says-1485800769 â€¦
please stand up for us! Vote no!

2018 elections are just around the corner. Republicans are going to lose a lot of seats in both house and senate.
Get your decency and morals out of your pocket and get the dictator and his ban of cronies out of the People's house

Please start impeachment proceedings or mental health testing of @POTUS .
#stopbannon
