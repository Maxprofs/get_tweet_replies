@PirateWench @Thales99 @SenPatRoberts What was he supposed to do?
@GenXcon77 vote for some background checks? Not allow people on the "watch list" buy guns? Serve his constituency? @Thales99 @SenPatRoberts
@PirateWench @Thales99 @SenPatRoberts Background checks exist. If you have never tried to buy a gun, shutup.
@GenXcon77 So shut the fuck up yourself you moronic piece of shit. Fuck you.
@PirateWench Hahahahha!!! Cry more. I win, you lose.
@SenPatRoberts 332K from the NRA. we know who you work for.
@SenPatRoberts What are you going to do about the 30,000+ US gun deaths annually?................... <crickets>.......... thought so.
@SenPatRoberts Of course you will. You got $322K from @NRA. #sorryass
@SenPatRoberts  maybe ask your grand masters at the NRA why they used to support backgrounds checks but now don't?
@SenPatRoberts You will never get my vote.
@SenPatRoberts you are the real problem, your just to stupid to realize it! Sell out!
@SenPatRoberts wait...  So the guns aren't the cause of gun violence?  Enjoy your check, you shill.
@SenPatRoberts By allowing terrorists access to guns?
@SenPatRoberts what is the "real problem"???? Inquiring minds want to know.
@SenPatRoberts You'll never get the blood of the children washed off your hands.
Tell us how expanded background checks inhibit lawful firearm transactions. @SenPatRoberts
@SenPatRoberts So incredibly sad that you are more concerned about an issue, that you look past what this is really about.
@SenPatRoberts If you know what the real problems that fuel gun violence are, why aren't you doing anything about them?
@SenPatRoberts what are the real problems that fuel gun violence in your opinion?
@SenPatRoberts Pat poor old #gunslut
@SenPatRoberts By the way, mighty tough of you to low blow our president and not even have the guts to respond to any of our comments.
@SenPatRoberts wow, you got 322k in NRA blood money to do nothing? How ingenuous, but aren't you worried about your soul?
@SenPatRoberts  nothing for you to fight against, nobody is taking away your rights. Don't lie about it!
@SenPatRoberts So what are the real problems??
@SenPatRoberts I would too if the NRA gave me almost a half million dollars.
@SenPatRoberts got $322K from NRA
@SenPatRoberts I mean, you could make a huge difference by addressing the "real" causes.
@SenPatRoberts If you plan to fight like you do in congress, we're not too worried. #donothing #gopfail #nrashill
@SenPatRoberts and what are those "real" problems and what have you proposed to do about them other than take money from the NRA?
@SenPatRoberts how much $ did you take from the NRA?
@SenPatRoberts what if Gates gives you 500k will you Change your mind?
@SenPatRoberts aren't too many guns the root cause?
@SenPatRoberts Precisely how will this impact right to self protect?
@SenPatRoberts spoken like a true #gunwhore who's received $322k from @NRA
@SenPatRoberts Spoken like a true NRA Stooge.
@SenPatRoberts you take $322,000 from NRA, don't care about what people want you obviously are a, #gunwhore
@SenPatRoberts Where is anything from your side on this issue? You're a horrible person.
@SenPatRoberts will you fund those problems that fuel gun violence, i.e. mental health, combating  inner city poverty? I doubt it.
@SenPatRoberts hey if I give u $323k will u fight for whatever I want?
@SenPatRoberts So you'll just keep doing nothing. Good to know you're getting paid off by the NRA to do nothing.
@SenPatRoberts And what are those real problems that fuel it again?
@SenPatRoberts Whats the real problem then Senator?
.@SenPatRoberts POTUS just made it easier for law-abiding gun owners to buy guns. If you don't support that, we know
it's only about the $$.
@SenPatRoberts I would if they paid me that much too
@SenPatRoberts hey Pat we don't know the real problems that fuel it because the NRA paid you 322k to vote not allow studies on gun violence.
@SenPatRoberts of course you will. You've been paid to.
@SenPatRoberts the people have spoken.. Do you read these comments?
@SenPatRoberts Background checks don't "threaten a right to self protect" & might save lives. Serve your constituents, not the NRA.
@SenPatRoberts 

Nothing he said does any of that.
Go back to counting your NRA $
