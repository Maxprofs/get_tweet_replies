#SummerSixteen #LA #Revenge https://www.datafilehost.com/d/cU1byYasf1 
Hip Hop use 2 be creative & orginal. That style has turned into recycled & generic music. You do nursery rhymes 4 dumbing down people
Your job is to rap about meaningless shit. That's why music industry chooses to push you as a major star. Your music isn't any good.
We live in time of #policestate & surveillance, blatant gov corruption, media distortion & mass poverty. Rap artist have no substance
bro your a fucking legend I don't give a fuck what the say 
Yo Drizzy, hit me up! I got a whole album for you and a book about the Moshiach. I need to tell you about Judah. I'm a Talmud scholar

How About Now Lyrics - Drake 
 http://lirik90.blogspot.co.id/2014/12/how-about-now-lyrics-drake.html …
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he
dad
Drake the pop style song on nba 2k17 is sick man

dude

yo drake looking at you makes me feel all warm inside because it triggers the radioactivity left in my body from Hiroshima
am lyk dad!
