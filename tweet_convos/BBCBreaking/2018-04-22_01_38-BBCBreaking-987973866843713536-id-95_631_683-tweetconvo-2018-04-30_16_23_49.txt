When will these extremists learn there is nothing glorious about blowing innocents to pieces? At least one of them has found out that there is no reward waiting for him
Welcome to the Religion of Peace

Nothing so terrible as individuals voting to express their values.  This is some tyrannical fanatic taking his own life to force his on everyone else.  People like that deserve to be dead, and those who pay the ultimate price because of it are war heroes.
Rest in Peace. May we work towards a better tommrow.
What a shame. People taking time to vote come back on coffins. Shouldn’t soldiers protect the voter registration center
Did Britain intervention make things better in

Afghanistan?

Good.
Can we leave now?
There has not been democracy in Afghanistan since Alexander's conquering  Greeks ruled the place thousands of years ago,

Fucking towels everywhere!

Lovely people the Taliban. Such enlightenment.  #afghanistanCrimes
80% of Pashtoons = terrorists, feel sorry for non Pashtoons being stuck with this backward uncivilized animals in da same country!!

Bombings again
This evil idiology will never end,they are Satan themselves with no regard for the souls of God.

This is really devastating. These people can't seem to move forward into a legitimate society. All of the Tribal warfare is a left over from the stone age. They have to give this up. These people need to be educated in the,21st. century of peace.
Rip
I have just read Eddie Ayres book, Danger Music, which brings the personal view to the terrorism in Afghanistan.
we were killed in the last forty years and we are killed until now and we don`t know how long will we have been killed?
Why is the world under the shades of fanatism and hate? So sad, It seems that in 2000 years we hadn't learned anything 
Nations, countries and regions such as these probably aren't suited for democracy. They just don't have it in their DNA. Let them do their thing...but perhaps not let them run free on streets in Western world...as in Sweden. Rape and crime on dramatic rise.
My sentiments too. Certain countries need a rigid system. They didnt mess around a lot in the days of Saddam.  Dictatorship works with some nations....as long as the people are not starved by their rulers.
No. I was be sarcastic. I really don't think dictatorship is good for anyone but the dictator. As Churchill said "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others".But it can't be forced on people. And in Sweden we have seen what these people do in freedom.
Death cult

The people that do this are nothing more than murderers not saints! To take innocents are nothing more than calculating & will never make peace or control. Terrible to just do this, when will violence of any kind stop? No Win here just lunacy!
UN peace keeping force should take it as challenge
When will peace outweigh evil?!
Only the dead know peace.
But... but... Religion of Peace.....?
just terrible
The suicide bomber targeted the crowd that had gathered outside Voter Registration Centre to collect National Identification Cards.
Afghanistan: Graveyard of Empires.
The Taliban denied involvement in the attack which indicates it may have been carried out by Islamic state affiliate.
The only solution is Americans pulling out themselves..and peace will be restored...
i do not support of American but in my opinion if america is pulled out of this country and there willl be the same result as Russia was pulled out and Mujahideen started to fight each other.
In total agreement but that will not last longer.. and peace will prevail...
terrible
A suicide bomber blew himself up outside voter registration centre in Kabul killing 31 and injuring 54.
And this will achieve what precisely?
As good a time as any to remind everyone that Muslims are disproportionately the victims of Islamist attacks.
Distraction from recent claim (and lack of evidence) of apparent Syrian chemical attack??? Buying time to "plant" evidence???
Just so I'm clear, are you claiming the BBC staged a suicide attack in Kabul in an attempt as some sort of maskirovka? I really hope this is satire
My god 

Inalellah Wana Elaihy Rajegoun . ..
Cheers dubya.
So Muslims killing other Muslims is the West’s fault?
Better find those attackers before they suicide next time so you can let them immigrate to London and gib you diversity
Awful.
hmmm
Sad. No more violence! #Kabul
