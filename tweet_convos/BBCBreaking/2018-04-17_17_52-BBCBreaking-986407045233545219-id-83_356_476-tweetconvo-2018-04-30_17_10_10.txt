If a meeting occurred, which I doubt, it was not secret and would have been sanctioned.
@msnbc @cnn @Morning_Joe @jheil @howardfineman @DeadlineWH @Eugene_Robinson @hardball @TheLastWord @maddow @allinwithchris @TheBeatWithAri @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @thr BREAKING: "Secretary of State nominee Mike 'Big Mike' POMPEO secretly met with North Korea's Kim Jong-un"
@RepAdamSchiff @RepSwalwell @SenFeinstein @MarkWarner @SenSchumer @thehill @TheView @SRuhle @nypost @Newsweek @MotherJones @HuffPostPol  @NewDay @DemGovs @tpm And TRUE to form, POMPEO flat out REFUSED to tell Congress if KIM Jong-un tried to PRESSURE him into FIRING Jim COMEY.
Alright... it’s true. Mike and I had a few jars at Wetherspoons and then went on for a game of snooker at Riley’s. I bought the kebabs later on. Not sure what the t’do is over this.
I love the diplomacy. And rooting for it. But I can't help but wonder how Trumps allies are trying to justify this, compared to what they thought about obama/iran/Iran deal.
this is actually a chance at peace not the nuclear “deal”. Iran will be building nukes when it expires.
So why doesn't the same logic apply to north korea???????????
we bribed the Iranians with an awful deal and a midnight cash drop. North Korea will be different
What you call a bribe, I call a part of a deal. Deals can't be one-sided. We will have to give things to the north Koreans in order to get them to do what we want.
yes both sides should benefit, but what have we gotten out of the Iran deal? Deals should be reciprocal.
We get a non nuclear iran. The same thing we will get from a north korea deal. 

If you're against Obama and Iran, fine. But you can't turn around and support Trump and north korea
I’m not against Obama or Iran, it was just an awful deal in general no matter your political stance.
seeing as how he has not been confirmed, I think this was a premature meeting.
MR . PRESIDENT ! WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO CLEAN UP THE SWAMPS !! MR . MULLER IS DOING A GREAT JOB  ABOUT  IT !!!
Secretly?

Mike Pompeo, NOMINEE FOR CIA chief, met secretly with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ...

Какой  яд?  Новичок  блин.  Эту  каргу  отравили  новичком  америкаки.
NO but how, that country doesn't have airplanes that can go across the ocean? Did he go to him? and why was that not reported?
It wasn't reported because it would have been a covert mission. Do you really belive both governments aren't speaking through back channels and not hard for them to allow an American off the radar plane into the country.
WH house leaked Pompeo's trip to N. Korea in hopes of shoring up votes for his confirmation. You do not have the votes currently and understand you are not favored to be selected. Confirmation moved to next month. @whitehouse @washingtonpost @nytimes
Well, at least he didn't send Ivanka. Oh, right, She was playing Secretary of State somewhere else. #missedopportunities
Fishier than a month old fish
Hummmmmm  ,  no mention of the Syrian Chemical attack , or the lack of Chemicals  ,  Keep up the good work 
Rather than attack Trump, how about some support to bring this to a successful conclusion?
That's what spies do, right?  
Only Trump would tread where all others failed, namely  @HillaryClinton @BarackObama
Oops the Dems will call for another enquiry to waste tax payers money and media will get looney as well.
@StephMillerShow @frangeladuo @szwest1 Leaving this in the hands of MASTER DEAL maker trump, will result in him selling NUKES to DPR
So Pompeo is 'de facto' Secretary of State, WITHOUT BEING CONFIRMED BY CONGRESS. Mmmmm another path to dictatorship.
So what? Since when is it a crime for two men to talk?
I VWANT 2 ZAY THAYNK U VRUM EVREE 1

Well, guess the meeting between Kim and Pompeo is no longer a secret-nice going Trump.  Hope your desire to have everything funneled thru you won’t scare-off a meeting with Kim.
A real leader gets things done....
Bromance!
I don’t believe it. Source?
My question is is he meeting him as cia director or sec of state cuz uh he’s hasn’t been confirmed as sec of state and I thought (could be wrong) he was no longer cia director. So why?
Shhhhh its a secret
What is Pompeo? CIA Director? Secretary of State? Pooper scooper at the White House?? What is his job currently?
So, @realDonaldTrump nominated #MikePompeo March 31, 2018 and the same weekend, Pompeo met with #KimJongUn. In what capacity and who did @POTUS tell about this??
The next ultra rich will be those who unlock asteroid mining. Get your part of this limitless wealth by making your own claim: http://WSMCR.org 
I wouldnt call it secret if the media knows about it.
North and South Korea are working towards peace on the peninsula. Trump will try to take credit for this. It’s a deflection.
Wow, someone actually doing their job. I know... people are freaking out because they are use to nothing being done during the Obama administration.
Probably with some Russian Spies thrown in
Good
Imagine the GOP if John Kerry had done that for Obama? #Hypocrites #GOPTraitors
Collusion...Mueller, you're up!!!
They are worried about Pompeo’s confirmation for Sec. if State, so they are like ‘hey, he’s already talking with Kim Jong Un, he needs to be confirmed’.
really you deal with them you have no home in usa
So basically when they were threatening each other on media, there was also a friendly sideline story going on.
Carrot and stick.
How can this happen? Pompeo has not been approved by the house to do this job. #impeach #putinspatsy
OMG who is dressing the press secretary.

If you’re liberal.. I bet if this was true it wouldn’t impress you.. no matter how unprecedented... and you should try to look into yourself and figure out what the hell is so wrong with you that you can’t give even a tiny fraction of credit where it’s due because of your hatred.




he is play ing the music box  look at history
kim is the  puppit
Was he confirmed as CIA Director or did I miss that?
Trump outstanding job  Brexit BBC hate it all

This took you awhile. Didn’t you tell me trump pays you to write articles with diff news logos?
So, did Mike poissoned Kim?
What a good question with impeccable spelling
Let’s hope the North Koreans don’t sense something is _fishy_ negotiating with a CIA Director #poissoned
The meeting to prepare for direct talks between US President Donald Trump and Mr Kim took place over Easter weekend, unnamed officials told the Washington Post and Reuters. Trump succeeding where past Presidents Failed
Sure Ivan.  Imagine the GOP if John Kerry had met him for Obama?  #Hypocrites #partybeforecountry
What is he meeting him as? The yet to be confirmed Secretary of State or going out CIA Director?
Complete BS, nobody met with #KimJongUn , @realDonaldTrump just wants the US to believe he's actually doing something and everyone loves him
Guys, this is not verified. Stop. Just stop.
WTF
Oh
Not very good at keeping secrets this lot.
Not so secretly apparently
Not very secret then is it
Well,  it did take almost 2 weeks to leak.  That's a record I believe.
Hmmmm
