A machine
Good luck .Made me smile.
Great work Kipchoge.Reminds us of the great Kipchoge Keino of 1960's.
British Media always following No Farah, while the real lion Eliud Kipchoge was ahead of the pack
Congratulations..the greatest marathoner of all time
Wonder where Mo would be if he didn't keep messing about with his bottles.
In a different league, incredible distance runner
What's with all the moaning about coverage. It is the same every year, you won't watch an OB like this from anywhere in the world that doesn't break up like that. Maybe you should watch more sport and stop the moaning.
A Brit to be proud of
Why Tweet this to an International audience and then geo-block it
Well done
Congratulations 
am restricted watching due to my location...BBC sport am a kenya and we worn

Amazing performance and the best marathon runner we have seen
Missed it coverage rubbish may forget to pay my license fee for a while.
We got ourselves a grade A BADASS over here 
Nl
Eliud Kipchoge.. a poetic marathon artist! Africa hails him!
Am in Borough in SE London, with helicopters STILL flying overhead at 22.30 - are people still running..?
It was a pleasure to watch the elite runners too.
May not have been a record they were given wrong times according to a Sun tweet
Good for him
Can we have the music turned down a bit when the commentators are speaking please - can’t hear half of what they’re saying. And you never know it might be interesting!
JUST SAW on bbc live the firefighters in full kit running for Grenfell on tower bridge 

a picture from bbc of these guys  would be superb
And I've only just got up..
Better than not finishing http://www.casinoplaysafe.com/best-uk-online-casino/ …
Even the drug cheat Mohammed Farah could not keep up with the ‘home crowd’ behind him. Kipchoge is a dominant force for 15 years. No drugs can beat the #Kenyan warriors and the #Ethiopian elite forces!! #ProudlyKenyan #LondonMarathon18
Couldn’t be arsed with a Kenyan vest at the Commonwealth Games though.
The commonwealth where the Brita pretend all is well and bring the colonies together?

Yeah I wouldn't be arsed with it too
Good luck Charlie you can do it xx
Where Mo farah
Congratulations Eliud!

Come on Scott Roberts doing amazing
Thanks BBC for making the marathon messages so small that they are impossible to read 
#londonmarathon @BBCSport  You taught us English & all the pronunciations. Allow us to teach you how to pronounce our names. For  Kosgey is  KOS GEY not KOS GUY.  For  Chesire  say CHE  SI  RE  NOT   CHE SIRE.
Well done to all St John Ambulance Personel great job guys 
Good luck to Dr Vicky Beale running for the Northern Cleft Foundation xx
The interference in this broadcast was shocking!
Who cares
We as Kenyans and Kalenjin in particular cares, Get the duck out of here

Coverage was awful
Eliud Kipchoge has been described as the greatest marathoner of the modern era.
The man's a flippin robot 
Yeah he is...
Yaaaaaas Kenya!
#MagicalKenya
Well deserved Eluid Kipchoge 
#LondonMarathon #LondonMarathon2018 #londonmarathon Kenya
Fantastic performance by Kipchoge and well deserved win
congrats..proud to be a Kenyan
He came third
Great shot 
Too much coverage on just the elite runners
Even now after they have finished you're still showing them 
How about coverage of the other thousands of people who are running and a lot are raising money for charity too!
Fantastic run! Well done! @BBCBreaking @BBCSport
stop going on about the heat....its the same weather for every one of them...........#excuses
Did anyone else notice Kipchoge didn't have a watch on? Did he do that without knowing his pace? A pleasure to watch!
Clocks and times all around the course maybe? 
Maybe....but that wouldnt give him his personal pace though!
Shame about the rubbish pictures and sound problems as always. What do we pay our license for when the coverage is this crap.
Fantastic
Now can we see the public running!!!!!! Its great seeing the athletes and them finishing so quick but thats all weve seen so far! Get the real reason we like to watch the marathon on the screen...All those amazing fundraisers...what its all about!
Terrible coverage of #Mo
You messed the last moments of his glory. Shame!
Inb4 he gets done in for doping
Yes Mo farah.
These marathon runners are just machines. Fair play 
And 14 years older than second place
