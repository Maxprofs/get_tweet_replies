Another beautiful child!
Alfie was a beautiful child too.
I think I speak for everyone when I say that nobody cares.
You don’t speak for me either
Why do you actually care?
In 1559 @queenelizabeth 1 England, crowned @wabbey in #London is a her'man & #German & @easyDNA_ will prove a #RoyalBaby does not exist & @Charles_HRH is not line to a throne nor @RoyalFamily..

Dejected; I had big money on Donald.
#AlfieEvans is the name the world
Cares about
Your so right
Louis the Lizard.
Derrick
Shit name #
Darn. I bet the name was going to be Josè
I had money on Donald ;-)


Who cares if he's named Richard the lion heart or oliver Cromwell?
This #royalbaby has the right, but not #AlfieEvans.
......and?
Oh, wow! Fascinating! Now tell me something useful!
You certainly don't speak for me, so STOP TRYING!!
What did you do now?

#RoyalBabyBoy gets to live..While #AlfieEvans was taken off life support..denied help in Italy..and Government decided he should die..My God what  has happened to this world?
Baby finger show peace sign..
Suggestion don't have many more there aren't to many of the same 3 or 4 names left.

My heartiest Congratulations to the beautiful little Royal Family, The Duke & Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte & brand new Little Prince Louis, May God Keep You All Blessed Always, Duchess of Cambridge looking Glowing, Happy & Beautiful...love from Canada
Couldn't they name someone Phillip?
Save Alfie!
Nothing to save, there is no higher brain in his head.
Parents have a right to take him out of the country if they wish. UK is a fascist regime...but her colonies always knew that.
Oh, because the parents wanted to inflict “cruelty”on their child. Your comment is worthless.  The government of a few people does  not have a right to tell parents you may not take your child to another hospital outside the country for treatment.
Anyone notice the v sign from baby
welcome to the world Louis Arthur Charles 

May God keep and protect you in Jesus mighty name Amen

@louisjjjones u have a royal name
I do indeed, I was destined for greatness since birth
We’ll have to wait and see if this kid turns out Ginger. If it does I’ll be questioning why they didn’t just adopt you’d be the same
Top banter from the girl with a name no royal wants. JEALOUS
@AKillo28
I swear you called this one!!! @AKillo28
I was close!! @Kmar3196
Waiting for all the morons to start saying they dont like the name.  Sure Kate and Wills are arsed what Peter in Nottingham thinks.
XD
I'm not very good with roman numerals Jack.
LMAO
Louis is awesome great name
Offs!
Lady has baby and gives it a name.
congrats#royalbaby#Louis Arthur
Wow! Lovely name for the royal prince
A lovely name. Congratulations William and Kate. X
So not Darren then

Not only she dressed "Rosemary's Baby" dress, but also chose Robert DeNiro's character name on "Angel Heart"!

Hello baby...get in line , behind the guy thats behind charles
He’s very sweet !!
He’s bloody ugly!!

who cares
I do, @WarhawkMD !!
We do
Who cares!
I care, MJHutchby !!
King Louie?!
triplets?

i personally like the name. I wanted to name my middle son Lewis, but everyone was opposed.
Considering the way Britain is heading and the country he will inherit, they should've named him Abdullah Mohammed Ahmed Al-Englandi

Lmfao nobody cares
Ugly baby
Is Kate trying to tell us something with her red dress? Diana wore red leaving with harry (the last child) Is the red a deliberate signal saying Louis is the last one for them? :) #LouisArthurCharles
That's what you think... harry kane is sorting it.....
Im confused how can he be named the same name as their first sons last name...Louis??
Was hoping for a prince Arthur a good solid name . Louis sounds too French
Does one say Lou-is or Lou-ee? As a Velvets fan, I’m just gonna call him Lou.
Hundreds and thoudand children are born every day, what is so funcken big about child born in a roysl family to occupy the news

#wonderfulworld

Aww that beautiful name....
3rd child , wonder if they will be claiming tax credits, oh sorry , rape clause would have to be met.
Thank you for being honest about what’s happening in the UK. I also wonder if their child had the same condition as Alfie Evans if they would be denied the right to go to Italy for treatment?
Love it 
Another  spilt brat
Who cares. Why was he not called Bob or cliff
I voted for Wayne. No one ever listens to me.
No one cares. British people will work to death to pay for this baby’s life mistakes.

It’s the 21st Century, time to end the monarchy.

Alfie Evans, a normal Brit baby, is dying & nothing is done to help him.
Not the most flattering picture of baby, but I’m sure little Louis is cute in person. Hey, “Little Louis” has a nice ring to it!

Congrats from Canada  William & Kate 
When we amalgamate with France he could be Louis XX
  
Such a patootie
How cares
Who's How and why does he/she care?
Lovely, wish him happy furture.
Sounds very french to me 
Something nice for a change always nice to see a lovely babyxx
No one gives a fuck!
How is this breaking news???
Do they pronounce this “Lew-is” or “Lew-E”
News pronounced it Lew-e 

For the sake of integration, I was expecting the baby to be named Mohammed.
Still spamming this shit. Nobody gives a shit
@BBCBreaking this isn't really worthy of a push notification
Sad that our Royal Family have bowed to Sadiq Khan's request and named their newborn after the Racist and Anti-Semitic hate monger Louis Farrakhan.
Lol well I got the CHARLES right.

Welcome to the world
#PrinceLouis

P.S. is it LouEE or Lewis ?
Lou ee after Chucks favourite uncle Mountbatten
Got the Arthur right.  Spencer in there somewhere would have been nice
Just be glad they haven’t named him Muhammad Ali Akbar to show how diverse the royal family is now!!
Beautiful baby 
Lovely name
Do adorable!!
what do you know about Alfie Evans history? #AlfieEvans
 And
It’s really moving to see that Lord Louis is not forgotten. #LouisArthurCharles #RoyalBabyName #RoyalFamily
Wonderful!
It shows the royal family's ambition to reclaim France for the English crown.

to be honest it is their child they maybe royal but they are al human 
leave them alone
As soon as they stop recieving cash from the public they will be left alone, until then, the public own them
@LBC @guardian @thetimes @TheSun @talkRADIO #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyName #williamandkate #royalfamily _ Who new that William and Kate were big fans of the X-Factor? Louis Walsh will be thrilled. Godfather? Louis or a Kardashian. Hopefully Simon Cowell isn't too upset.
No one asked you.
Holy hell there are some miserable buggers in thie comments

@sophi3clark ET
What’s wrong with his forehead?
Media frenzy for another privileged royal while people are dying of the cold and have to go to food banks. 
Utter disgrace but the brainwashed love a royal baby don’t they.
That's such a classy name!
sponsoring  chaos/illegal war ard in the world.
Disregarding other royal families in Africa nd ME .
Killing innocent soul.
And here u are promoting urs. Making 4 days old baby famous in the name of royalty/supremacy. 
The story wil be televise.
Love the name 
But they already have a Louis ...... it’s Prince George’s third Christian name. Rather lacking in imagination to use the name again for this one

Hopefully they will call him Arthur Britain could use another Camelot
Never a Scots name!
What did I tell you? I have paid the F.... TV licence (BBC ) you have broke the breach of contract. I said Royal family do not be allow in TV news or tweet. Please remove it. Also Harry's secret father is Captain James Hewlett so that the News. I have Piad the f,,,, royal family!
Lovely name
Hmm bit French, isn’t it?
That's amazing....get the bunting out....haha....who really gives a f###....
A splendid European name. Should give all true Brexiters  apoplexy.
Good
After the old paedo Louis Mountbatten?
Awww I was hoping they’d name him Sterling Archer
so, he has the potential to become King Louis? *sings* now I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P....
Yes. This tweet wins my Inzernet Award for today.
Not Breaking News - @BBCNews pampering to the aristocracy yet again.

@BBCNews do your job and stop hiding the crimes of the Tory government behind a family that thinks their DNA is radically different from everyone else.
Haha yes xxx
Tale of two kates.

Thanks Rosado
 

Damn thats £10 down the drain...............i was sure they would name him Muhammad Jamal...............
Not sure if that's going to make my life more or less difficult. 
How about naming him #ALFIE
The beautiful boy that Britain is killing in the hospital. .@Alfiesarmy
As are you. Name calling is not cool
It's weak. I'm educating myself on Twitter University. U should try it.
Making inflammatory comments on things that you have clearly not done even the most basic research on is also not cool. I stand by my original assessment of you.
I wouldn't have posted ot if I didn't  researched it. If it's ok for you to watch a baby die while glorifying the birth of another,  its not ok with the world. The whole world is aware of this child. Doctor's claim his brain is mush, what are they so afraid of?
Your the genius.
They are afraid causing unnecessary suffering to an already very ill child.
Yes,we've been hearing all that.  Shouldn't the parents have a say in that? I think they're afraid of showing the country that socialist health care is not working. Always an agenda much like the Democrats in the states. But whatever the case it'll be a bad turnout.
Where is your evidence that socialist health care isn't working?
King Louis
Yawn...
Prince Pepe
Louis-what’s the second name Kincora ?
@Elliemaeyoung @lauragumbrell @lucy_spruzs wow
King Louis of ... England.
It was between that and Princey McPrinceFace I believe.
I was hoping for "Chet"!
#BabyAlfie
Was hoping they would put "Hussein" in the middle. Bummer!
A billion blessings to the royalbaby:LAC !
Oh, an anti brexit first name in common with the continental French.
What a stunner
Okay cool
Another game shooting racist snob to train up.
I learned today from RAF personnel who served the Royal Cosa Nostra at dinners. You are mute. You only speak to lady in waiting. The Queen doesn’t drink wine. None of them eat strawberries. Just like...
And #peteprice the shape shifting deviant
The baby looks awfully unhappy and cold  his poor little fingers are purple. He should have little mittens on. IMO. #momof4 #dontlike unhappybabies
No baby's been named Arthur since 1950..
Gutted, I thought they'd call him Mohammed
In celebration, we have provided tips on the stocks new parents should consider for a Junior ISA fit for their prince or princess. Risk of Loss https://www.share.com/stock-markets-and-news/opinion-and-analysis/2018/april/the-royal-treatment-build-a-junior-isa-fit-for-a-monarch …
Everyone who cares about this should be placed in an institution, for their own good, and for the benefit of society as a whole.
Your picture is of an owl you melt
You have a problem with owls?
This Louise is very confusing..
I was hoping for Nigel  now, let's save our Country from Tories.
Ooh it sounds a bit french..not sure brexiteers will like that..
Brexit was for me all about breaking away from the massivley corrupt EU and nothing about immigrants or not liking foreigners.
Louis fantastic name 
Wahao,welcome on Earth
So original.
And
@NieRGame and @FFXVEN gives me here '_'
Yeah
Dilly dilly
more uk tax payers money like welfare children
He’s so adorable
Very Royal. Nice name too. 
Louis Saxe-Coburg Gotha awesome
No doubt named after his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother Duchess Louise of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha 
LOUIS!!!!

someone from work named his son Iceman Saiyaman
If bloody said Albert yesterday! Make your minds up!
Maybe someone could explain to this American why the choices are limited to ONLY names from the father’s side of the family. Why couldn’t even one name from Kate’s side of the family be included, like her father or brother?
#AlfieEvans
What if u I give my baby this name would he be a prince as well 
Obviously named after the famous French king.
I was hoping for Pete, but there you go.

Breaking news? .... why are you doing this?
still into princes and the aristos?
What about #PrayForAlfie #alfievans 
What if it were Louis Arthur Charles in place of this beautiful little boy Alfie Evans?!
WTF is going on that this boy is trying so hard to survive and you fookers are barbarically torturing him slowly! Let #AlfieEvan go!
#AlfieEvans
Long live Prince Louis
Sweet! Is that pronounced Lou-iss or Lou-ee? Asking for an Am friend 
It’ll be Loo-ee
That’s great, Allie Evans also has a name
DEREK
