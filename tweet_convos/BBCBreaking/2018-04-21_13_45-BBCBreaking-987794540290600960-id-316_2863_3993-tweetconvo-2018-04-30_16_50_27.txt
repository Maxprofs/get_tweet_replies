@WebsdaleCharlie :(
Such a short life.
RIP
MHSRIP. He was only 49. Why does he look much older than that?
He's faking death, right now he's in a Madagascar Island with Janis, Jim, Johnson and Jimi. 

Pushed death is pushed, tiny loss tbh senpai. 

I buried him in a shoes box in my garden, I never thought I was really going to ride a midget.

I remember him on celebrity big brother. He was a lovely man. What I remember the most was how much pain he was in most of the time. I was shocked as he hid it well
He will be missed. Another great talent gone way too soon
RIP buddy.

Rest in peace. He was dealt a different hand than many, and excelled.
