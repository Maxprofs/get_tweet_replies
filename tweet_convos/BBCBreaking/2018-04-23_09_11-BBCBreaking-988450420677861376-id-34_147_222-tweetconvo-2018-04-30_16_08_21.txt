These atrocities are fine. Apparently.
Is he a goodie or a baddie. Was he part of the 20 killed in the wedding party. Do you really care BBC.
They're busy thinking of how to turn this on Jeremy Corbyn.
Another Houthi terrorist sent to HELL 

Good job 
Saudi led coalition strike kills atleast 20 at wedding in Yemen.
Superb

Dozens of casualties being reported as US-Saudi bombs another wedding party in Yemen & blocks rescue workers from helping victims. How many funerals & weddings must be targeted for the intl community to draw its “red line”? https://twitter.com/faisaledroos/status/988168576849690624 …
IsIs will be happy
What about the Saudi bombing of a Wedding party 30 blown to bits,..I guess that's just Collateral Damage....
Went to the hell #Iranian funded terrorists in #Yemen

UK military personnel are helping Saudi blockade and bomb Yemen's civil infrastructure to create cholera and famine there.
Trump, May, & Macron are accountable 100%.
Saudi Arabia has made Yemen a slaughter house of their zeal and ambition, killing innocent people brutally and indiscriminately

*assisinated. Houthi’s are a legitimate and an integral part of Yemeni society, just because their right to protest doesn’t comply against your regional hegemony, it does not excuse you from respecting a social figure revered by thousands.
.كريم
Targeting advice from the British....kinda makes you proud (not)!

There ya go!
What a break they announced the new one 
Is this the same attack as the attack on a wedding?

Another twitter warrior

Terrible news coming out from Yemen that Saudi Arabia has carried out double-tap air strikes on a wedding party in Hajjah's Bank Qais district https://twitter.com/masirahtv/status/988156530007650304?s=21 …
