BBC creating stats to back the Tories so they can continue to support the Zionist lobby...
I think the first sentence says 'the office of national statistics' created the stats. But bashing the BBC is in vogue.....

Pound up against dollar, unemployment percentage lowest for decades, low inflation. What happened to the brexocalypse?
Pound up against the Euro?  That will be a no. Wages above inflation? no. Up - Homelessness, in work poverty, part-time employment, job insecurity. Keep kidding yourself.
All this and we are still in the EU. Working well then isn't it?
yep trump is even fixing england
Is there no end to this mans genius  trump for pm 
Brexit working...
Brexit has happened yet but the rate was 0.3% before the referendum if you are interested to know facts
I believe fully, it will straighten itself out. And it seems to be doing so already.
If you listen to Farage and May’s gang that’s what you would think. Listen to big businesses and financial sector they don’t seem to agree with your optimism!
So, if UK inflation fells, it would be good thing to the World?
I need it to go negative.

BbYou bbbbbbbbbibbbbub
Yeah my bank is still giving me less than 1% interest though the greedy bastards!

Always nice to see your hard earned money drop in value before your eyes.
But is still 0.7% above the target of 2%. They haven't met a single target they've set.

RPI not so much.. council tax
Fake news. Since the start of the year, price of milk up by 10% and fuel prices increasing by the day #fakenews
Reality as from this month
Wage down (home take less as pension rise to 3%)
Council tax up
Broadband up
Tv licence up
Mobile up
Not breaking news.
Great!
They included oysters and champagne this month, took out fuel bills and cost of fruit then? What about the RPI??
Indians...it had nothing to do with Modiji in London

Pound up against dollar, unemployment percentage lowest for decades, low inflation. What happened to the brexocalypse?
0.3% before referendum!
Bullshit
Grasping straws as the iceberg approaches. Ppl still hoping brains will kick into gear&Brexit binned. If not, wait till it's reality THEN...
And yet...
For the first time since summer 2015  Britain's inflation rate has fallen for two months running.
UK inflation hits one - year low of 2.5%.
@BBCNews is NOT a trusted news source #ToryPropaganda
Great so the Tories are beginning to tidy up the mess left by the Marxist Labour rabble.
Pesky Tories
Haven’t noticed

Wow 0.2% worth breaking that BBC, thanks very much x.
That’s good as I have not had a pay rise for seven years.
Have you considered getting a different job instead of moaning on social media about it.
UK real wages have been stagnant for over a decade, derren.
Plus positive signs of wage rising. So a definite rate rise?
