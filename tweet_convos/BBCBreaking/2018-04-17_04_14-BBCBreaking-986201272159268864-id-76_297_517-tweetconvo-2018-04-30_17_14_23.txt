Thanks to MP David Lammy @DavidLammy #Windrush #WindrushDeportations #Immigrants #ImmigrationUK #UK
Home office: *makes clerical error*
Media: OH MY FUCK DID YOU JUST MAKE A CLERICAL ERROR CAUSING A FEW DOZEN A SLIGHT INCONVENIENCE
Threatening people’s existence is not a small inconvenience.
Having to produce paperwork is a small inconvenience
It’s an absolute shambles that it happened and the media outrage is justified and should last to ensure it doesn’t happen again
It is an absolute shambles, wouldn't say the outcry is entirely justified though
See back to my first comment! Yes it’s justified
We've already gone though this, it's not a threat to their existance, it's finding a bank statement, or a marriage certificate. Not saying it shouldn't be covered but the way it's being talked about seems quite disingenuous
Which is too much to ask of people who at times came here as children!
While she's at it she could apologise to the rest of the country for making us all look like heartless racist!
Resign.
If @theresa_may or @AmberRuddHR had one ounce of decency they would both resign.
They haven’t and so they won’t.
#WindrushDeportation #TheresaMayResign #AmberRuddResign
They still seem to be deporting people according to David Lammy mp #ToryRacism #EnoughIsEnough
Apologise to all the PEOPLE themselves FFS!
Only after snubbing them and treating them inferior to her. Her govt refused to meet Caribbean high commissioners 2 years ago when they highlighted this problem. She’s got the moral authority of an alley cat who only reacts after being found out. SMDH!
She doesn't mean it shes just an old fashion racist like the rest of the cabinet
Yet returning #ISIS #Jihadists are welcome back in with open arms.
The Queen kicked her arse, didn't she?
Dont think the "windrush" people left because of no work at home they were more or less ordered to come to UK as direct labour after the war think you need a history lesson
Did the overzealous application of immigration regulations by the Home Office come from govt ministers including PM? Likewise implementation of Universal Credit rules.  Pressure from the heartless bigots and racists on the far right of the govt?
“Anxiety caused” - bit of an understatement when your whole life is turned upside down! This issue must be fully investigated immediately and be put right. It should not be allowed to drag on and hurt more people.
You could not make this up. Dad's Army
It was @theresa_may ‘s policy.  Her grand idea.  Apologies are hollow #fireTheresaMay  @DavidLammy where was the opposition when this was signed through. @theresa_may is the least of all British person.
It is difficult to see this (latest) PM apology as anything but an acknowledgement that the government’s cynicism has been exposed. The Windrush deportations have been known about for some time and nothing said or done by govt.until it was raised in Parl. Well done @DavidLammy
Will they be apologizing to us for importing yardie drug dealers murderers Gang members and reversed racists who despise a culture and our country that offered them everything
Great Britain was built on the backs of the ancestors of these people. Britain owes the people of Ango-Caribbean and not the other way around
Yeah dream on smoking too much weed mate
Go read a book 
I'm reading one at the moment it's called the white man's Burden

Shameful omission by the BBC on the 1pm News show. They blindly repeated May’s lie without any qualification. Multiple sources (see thread below) now confirming MAY lied at #PMQs. The #Windrush records were destroyed on her watch not Labour’s. https://twitter.com/d_raval/status/986568035501854721 …
It's outrageous that this happened to these people. It looked like how the Nazis started on German Jews in 1933. Stop making them prove who they are. Just give them citizenship. It's not difficult! And fire the idiots who messed up. This was a total cockup.
Theresa May should have been questioned whilst attached to a lie detector.
'Anxiety'?More like blind panic, officers coming to your house with battering rams to forcibly export you to an alien country, families torn apart, terminal illness untreated, homes, jobs and lives lost. COLD CALLOUS CRUEL MONSTER  MAY deleted the clause that prevented all this.
Carry on governing UK 
What a farce     
Looks nothing like Teresa May?
Too little too late. She changed the rules and caused the problem. Incompetent in everything she does
Anxiety! Fear, lost jobs, financial ruin, families torn apart. Ruth Williams son is her carer for God's sake. This government is morally bankrupt.

Why's she apologised to them? It's the people directly involved that need apologies from government.
@bbc5live words are cheap after ignorance for several years.
looooool Theresa May was FORCED to apologise. she’s done the same with other issues as well
why is the picture baracka obama
It isn’t.
your just saying that because of the glasses!
That’s Andrew Michael Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica 

#BBCAreRacist The reason why the BBC do not expose Theresa May secretly removed a  clause put in place to stop the deportation of Commonwealth citizens; from the updated 2014 Immigration Act is because the BBC…
Uk pm doesn't know the history created by uk themselves...
I am 100% hard #Brexit BUT #Windrush and #UgandanAsians etc rights MUST be respected and NOT allow an EU #free4all into UK
Not good enough @theresa_may
Needs to stop people loosing jobs, health coverage. Establish local areas to process applications for at least biometric cards at no charge
What on  earth is Windrush
Wow! I still can't believe this, this is beyond technology. Subscribe, watch, comment on the video, like it and share it with your friends. Watch to advance your tech skills. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y7UhxpWgjA …
How has this taken so long to surface? Where were all the investigative journalists to expose this ages ago.
Well I say that they all should be sent back to the Caribbean, they were invited to help Britain, nothing wrong with deporting them now
Ok it’s not been right But its being sorted, stop this continued knocking of the gov lets move on , as your clearly short of something to report on why not ask Corbyn why he is continuing to allow racism in Labour Party
@theresa_may you really don’t have any control over your staff do you! #alltalk
It's disgusting how the windrush migrants have been treated. Theresa May should be ashamed but why is Amber Rudd still in office? The HO caused this debacle so as head of HO she should be sacked.
The Caribbean people has always been treated unjustly by the British Establishment. Same in Salvery.The English slave drivers were compensated by Britain and nothing paid to the poor Slaves who toiled to death to bring great wealth to  #windrushjustice
@SkyNews what “records” is  the home office looking through to acertain the amount of  people deported? Would it not be the same records on which they’ve deported these people in the first place? #HomeOfficeRecordsSucks #windrushdeportation #indignity #Unfair #pmandrewholness
In the days of the Old West and the Homestead Act days, you had unparalleled freedom to invest, profit and capitalize. Those days are back thanks to the Space Act and the promise of Space Mining: http://WSMCR.org 
Absolutely disgraceful and unfair!
This  disgrace should NEVER have taken place!!
Last week Caribbean leaders honored Louis Farrakhan
What has this got to do with these insignificant Caribbean 'leaders'? May: gutless as ever.
@teresa_may what happens to the unfortunate people facing imminent deportation due to your legislation as HO ministe
We never apologise to our own do we !
How much more sucking up can she do

What is the fuss. If ileagal it's ok

She isn't sorry. These are her policies. Only apologising because of the backlash.
