Security forces attacked peaceful protesters with stun grenades and beaten the opposition leader
@derrickg745 don't know much about Armenian politics, but the crowd seems to be mostly men of a certain age ?.
Not at all. There's young women as well as grandmas protesting with their own sons and daughters. And there are old men, young men, and all in between protesting as well.
you must do it yourself ....without help from abroad..or you are waiting some money?of course,you are!
you are absolutely right , it is not a question to you . it is a fact...
The voice of reason, as always.
God bless Armenia!

@KimKardashian @cher

This is all useless.  Down with one lot of corrupt thugs and many more are in the queue to take over. We need a #Saakashvili type of president, who would actually care for his people.
Please share
There were no clashes, masked police violently detained @nikolpashinyan and other leaders of the movement.
if it would happened in Russia ,we would can see a lot comments about that (basically are negative) , but it is Armenia...
Что ты несешь? В чём смысл твоего пердежа?
тебе,еблану,не понять,ты же не с этой планеты даже,даун...
Yerevan must learn democracy from the West and the US! The demonstrators must be dispersed with gas, batons and rubber bullets.
