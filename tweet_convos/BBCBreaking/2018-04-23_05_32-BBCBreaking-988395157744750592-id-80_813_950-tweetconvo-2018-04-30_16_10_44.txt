@DaCowGoesMeow something trump won't do
A shining beacon of democracy in hat region.  Cheers Armenia!
Thank you
Trinidad and Tobago should do this if they really fed up

I wonder if it would work with Trump?
It's funny how soldiers coming out in protest tends to make potential dictators think again.
No violence, not one drop of blood. This is how you protest people!
dysfunctional nation
@narendramodi  will modi (Indian prime minister) @Iypan8 do the same ?

Since May 2014, Muslim hate-mongering, lynching, encounter, Brutal child rapes are on raise
All are inspired by this video, but not warned by Modi
Wish Modi will do the same
No way, that happens only in democracy
First Velvet Revolution since 1989? #Armenia #YerevanProtests
That is where the voice of the masses have value
I can see that you haven't mentioned this on your news page. I am sure it is an oversight or maybe something to do with UK selling arms to Saudi Arabia!
Never mind that. Has he had a baby.
NOW BBC WHEN WILL YOU REMEMBER
Never happens in South Africa.
Well in south africa won't happen because the politicians went to exile to eat from our tax pockets
Yep. They are entitled to the big life.
You just got rid of Zuma!!
The UK needs to take lessons from Armenia  and oust our caretaker PM
this is exactly like wenger


Geez it's only taken this guy days to resign after protests against him?
I liken Trump to a turd that JUST WON'T FLUSH. we've been having to protest his 'presidency for far too long.
@bobkevoian here's a job for ya ;)
If only Malaysia’s PM can take a cue fr this #GE14
If I only @realDonaldTrump would follow his example.
Didnt learn about #QAnon yet?
Please have a look.  You will be happy
Buhari is the next one
Which Way #Nigeria"@BBCBreaking: Armenia's Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigns after days of protests against him
See America it’s not that hard? Just days of protests! Stop making protests like Coachella.
Give it Mkhitaryan till end of the season
Wish May would do the same.
Wenger?!
Follow the lead Trump and May... follow the lead.

Ah, the wise and considered opinion of the shallow end of the gene pool. 

Good for you.
Theresa May should take note!
Free Armenia ! No More Soviets there!
Sargsyan is a conservative.
Money laundering there had soviet oil flavor
You take the country out of a corrupt system, but you can't take the corrupt system out of a country.
Can we do this to @theresa_may?
After Final Vote against brexit she will do
Yeah, I doubt she'll be Prime Minister this time next year.
Also Brexit will be fallen on same time...place for UK it is in EU
I agree, but we're two years into a three year negotiation period. We can only finish it now.
Settlements are written on paper, right now could be use Brexit paper on shredder machine, and Calm to get back on EU track
