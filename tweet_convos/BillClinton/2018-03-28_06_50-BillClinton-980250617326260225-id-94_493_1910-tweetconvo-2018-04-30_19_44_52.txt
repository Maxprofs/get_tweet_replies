It’s Official: Obama Attempted a Secret Coup
Former President Barack Obama began working against Donald Trump from the moment Trump won the GOP nomination.
Thanks, Kevin! @ThreadIntl
How much

Cheers!
Kambahteh!
You look too gloomy!
That's fantastic! 
I talk to attorneys, tried the governor and the mayor yet no one even some of the most impactful people won’t help save countless lives which are being destroyed I’m almost embarrassed to be a citizen
The corruption in the family law legal system has to be halted immediately why won’t anyone help countless lives for over 10 years have been destroyed and it is still happening help please they took my son and want to destroy his mind
Text: SCHOOLS To: 67076 if you think Hillary Clinton would make our Schools much better as President!

Where is your #Easter message Billyboy? 
These shoes are made from the Blood of Murdered School Children

I LOVE that Timberland is helping Haiti.  They need as much support as we can give them.  Just ordered a pair of Newport Bay Chukka Boots in Olive Canvas.  Can't wait to get them.  Thanks to President Clinton for re-tweeting this and making me aware of this great cause!
Tic tac tic tac
Give them their money back 

Nobody wants boots that are made from trash that comes from a shithole.
Great work Timberland! 

Yea you can’t prove that , and I will not take a DNA test because I already know he’s mine said Billy Boy
What an incredible input to save life and better the environment. Great job.
Outstanding.  If businesses looked at the giant floating islands of plastic trash in the oceans as "resources," they'd be fighting for the rights to mine them.
Send DJT @realDonaldTrump a pair. He might appreciate Haiti  for a change or change his attitude to  whichever comes first.
"Huh?"
If you give people a  chance,they  will do a good job.
@TheOceanCleanup, @BoyanSlat apparently you can make awesome shoes from recycled plastic. I wouldn’t mind wearing plastic soup gear.
They’re free with $25k donation to the Clinton Crime Family Foundation.
Amazing! Good job!
Are they going to recycle the blackberries that Hillary smashed?

Republic of Haiti.
Hey man @BillClinton love ya bro! @realDonaldTrump @joerogan
Great , that's all we need.
Send me a pair how much?
And paying those folks a living wage I’m sure...
I enjoyed it to mr. president it was wonderful
Good idea

Wow , hope you don't start making boots out of the missing children next. #CF give back the $
Inspiring
I didn't read anything about fair trade. Timberland's trash pickers probably only get paid $1000/yr.
Wonder why are they didn't have the time to create new jobs in America
Tomorrow is my sons birthday and I can’t see him or speak to him why won’t anyone help me I’ve been there for him since he was born please help
Nice try
Perfect for Bill to wear while he rapes.
Best Regards, Mr President
Think this will make up for all the lies, scandal, and dead people on @BillClinton’s watch? God only knows. #KeepOnTryingBill
It's a better attempt than Bush's paintings and he's responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Off topic, jerkley.

Chelsea your mom is drunk and your dad is busy thinking about ways to sneak off and get a bj do something please
The wave of the future.
Great
Recycling is smart. Ifcthere was a cheap way to harvest the huge pile of trash floating in the middle of the Pacific ocean, they could make lots of things.
Are the boots for Haitians
How many people were murdered to create these boots?
While the Trump Organization continues to screw and profit off everyone!
Is a some of that recycled material from Haiti used to make new wedding dresses?
Great article by @eilperin in @washingtonpost that covers the shady deeds of the Manufactured Homes Industry & @SecretaryCarson. Calls low-income people from the 'swamp' while bending over backwards for industry.  Shameful
