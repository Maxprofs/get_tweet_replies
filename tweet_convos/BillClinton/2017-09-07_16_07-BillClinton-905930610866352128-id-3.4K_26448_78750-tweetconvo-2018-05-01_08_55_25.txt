What does Chelsea need a dress?
Not the time or place.
I agree this family of thieves should have no place in a charity after what they did in Haiti

If Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  runs for president in 2020 who will you vote for ?
You needed (None of the above) Shawn. Lol
Lol I tweeted this in bill Clinton's Thread  only 17 people voted 2 retweets and most of them are Bernie Sanders supporters 4 hours ago lol
     That's hilarious.
Billy are you trying to pull another Scam here like you and hilderbeast did in Haiti?

Why Bill, so you can steal the money like you did in Haiti.
There are legitimate charities to give to.
Do NOT get involved w/Clintons!
#Irma
Looks like you left out the president that actually helped Texans during Harvey!
He couldn't even load a truck properly.
He wasn't hired to load a truck.
Trump was "loading" one for a photo o.o. it didn't end well, lol.
I don't care.  lol
Just saying you said he helped. He didn't really. He poorly posed helping for photo ops. Promised to donate money then walked it back.
Wrong!
I'd rather donate to the Red Cross or Samaritan's purse. I find I don't trust any organization that you, your hubby, or Obama support.
@LindaFrench you need to check out stories on the Red Cross. I donate there, not much choice hoping it'll help someplace. Ck. Charity Watch
...because Planned Parenthood also got A-, and as profit hungry as they are, I don't see how they're even a charity.
People like you who read made up disgusting articles that don't have a ring of true journalism and spread them about Ms. Clinton are psychos
You're ravaging minorities & you have the audacity to call Conservatives racist?#Whathappened #Haiti #HurricaneIRma
Why don't you do your book tour in #Haiti and tell them #whathappened
Please don't volunteer to steal more money like #Haiti
You crook Slick Willy!
NO!  I will never give any money to you crooks for "charity" or funding of anything !
I will give to a trusted organization.
FOUNDATION FUNDRAISING?
NO, THANKS.
REPUTABLE ORGS LIKE @SamaritansPurse & @RedCross MAY TRUMP U 
What a motley crew!  No wonder the #USA is in trouble.  #Criminals have been in charge for decades!  No more.  @realDonaldTrump is our hope!
There's something kinda exciting about all the living presidents coming together.
Just as long as they don't through #45 okay

Who Wants In YOUR Wallet?
[C  L  I  N  T  O  N]
(TWATTER is censoring stuff, again)...
After seeing @realDonaldTrump in (non)action, I'd take any one of these Presidents back in a heartbeat. I miss having a statesman in office.
Donald Trump is Making George W. Bush Great Again"
This is where @realDonaldTrump should send that $1M. Then these guys could verify receipt.
They need to find where the $$ that was intended for Haiti that the Clinton Foundation stole is first.
There are plenty of better organizations to donate to. This one is corrupt. Bad history!! Remember Haiti?
Yes tell them to get out, save lives and first responders, action is required
Open several lanes south to evacuating north driving highways away from Florida. Who drives south today? One lane is enough for that. Hurry!
Donald Trump donated a million dollars of his own money. How many millions have you stolen from generous Americans? Haiti all over again...
Trump PLEDGED a million & gave a breakdown of where it would go. He hasn't actually done it. With reports saying he'll never donate it
Who's more likely to deliver on their promise on this issue? The Clintons, both disbarred and one impeached, or our billionaire president?

#FL #Gov'nr:＂U'v got 2 get out...Cant waitMandatory #evacuation massive #devastating#HurricaneIrmamid #of FL Sun＂
#Tragic #news about #HurricaneIrma．Expected to rip throughmid of #Florida start'n Sun＆be #devastating－worse than #HurricaneAndrews in '92
I just hope everyone takes it upon themselves to evacuate and prepare if they are in an area where it’s necessary.
I will never be in anything 'together' with these crooks and criminals.

Please get the word out about the #USVI and the damage they have suffered from #HurricaneIrma . They're citizens and they're forgotten.

All you people are nuts! Why would I give bill any money! he'll just steal it like Haiti!
They're loving all the death & carnage this is causing. Makes me sick. I wish Trump wud drop all the truth bombs on their ass. Annvsry 911
This is so refreshing! Presidents with class.
Why don't you donate some of those $Billions from the Clinton foundation that you raised for the Hatians
@JimPummell look at this crook
Bill voted for Trump. He chose Hillary once. Biggest mistake of his life.
He got sick of smelling cabbage old farts, yellow teeth and a cackle that breaks glass I imagine
Like you helped Haiti?

Dont give a dime to anything Bill Clinton is involved with.He's a tragedy pimp. Raises money and wastes on first class life. Ask Haiti.
There are plenty of people losing homes to fires across the western US - Montana is devastated. Where r #OneAmericaAppeal presidents here?
I noticed how you left out our current @potus. Shame.
Love this non-partisan message from ALL our living former U.S. PRESIDENTS. May G-d bless you all with many more years to do good!
Thanks for your leadership, stability, compassion, words of encouragement for those affected by the storms they needed this
https://youtu.be/k1dOG-l1ri8 
Like the Clinton's did in Haiti?
Wow really hateful showing her true color
http://statefort.com/the-rachel-maddow-show-on-msnbc/ …

She was with Rachel Maddow taping a seg and caught on tape laughing about IRMA wiping out all those Fl Hillbillies
Sorry don't trust in Clinton's. Will use someone else who doesn't have them handling the money.
How contrived.
“Every cent” had certainly Better go to relief efforts, as the One America Appeal site asserts.
Signed, a former democrat
God is with you America!
You think so ? God doesn't appreciate Racism , Hate, unlawful shootings, Sexism etc No God don't like ugly so we hope God will have #Mercy
Ok. Let me get petty for just a second and say that i get great joy from fact that all 5 living presidents did this without the Rage Apricot
I love that they did that, too. It's a breath of fresh air.
@Bill Clinton Now this is presidential! Have donated my max. Hope all Americans donate something. Thank you!
What? No Clinton Foundation to help like you did in Haiti? Oh, but you DIDN'T HELP HAITI:/ But you & Hillary helped yourselves tho, as usual
Obama the treasonous one, Clinton the sex addict..a real trusting combo <cough>
@HillaryClinton  Haiti is STILL waiting for their money...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBe_guezGGc … Pervy Bill
Top President EVER. .. CIAO FROM RIMINI ITALY
Grateful 5 authentic Presidents stood up and ask for unity from the nation in helping with the disasters. We are ALL One!
We won't forget.
Thank you past Presidents showing America how government can work as one . Let's all do what we can in our country's time of need.
Like you helped Hati. No thanks. Donate to #RedCross not Clinton Crime.
Well said, sir!  God bless you and everyone who is donating to the relief efforts in Texas and the neighboring states.
Another scam brought to you by the Clintons . lol  no one trust you fools .
Power of the presidents !! Please help us get trump out of the White House!!
Presidential...that's what it looks like!
Than you #Presidents of the past some were great so not so great yet all were professionals not like the clown we have now! A citizen of Fla
I miss all ya'll - and given my history, that is saying so much. We need a leader right now!
Awesome... Republicans and Democrats - "TOGETHER".
DONATE TO RED CROSS!
Thank you Mr President
Donald Trump gave from his heart, you collect from the people and put it in your own pocket! Shame on you #maga
These are the true President of our history. Thank you for this wonderful heart warming tweet. Very meaningful.
Americans lift each other up. Let's have more of this, in the White House too.
Great work
This Insults President Trump!
You Left Our Current President Out!
You Are All Jealous Of His Exceptional 
Job Aiding Texas @realDonaldTrump

Bill you have proven that you cannot ve trusted. Haiti still waiting on the billions your foundation stole from them. Shame on you
Jimmy Carter looks well
@POTUS announced that $0 of his small $1M donation will be going to #OneAmericanAppeal. He's super jealous of our REAL Presidents!!
Say that...Mr Presidents! Love it. 
I miss ya Bill. 
Man, at this point, throw in one of the Bushes.  I'm desperate 
May god bless america
#MTFires #WAFires #CAFires #IDFires #ORFires #BCFires #WildFires We need water tankers like  needed D-Day #MontanaFires #OneAmericaAppeal
Whatever you think of some of their politics, what a contrast to the present incumbent.
What did the Clinton Foundation do to assist all these people?
Sir, what happened to the money for Haiti ?? No thanks. We are going to help without u.
Nobody gives a shit about what you have to say either.
I regret one vote in my 50 year life. That's the one to billyboy

.

Never trust clinton foundation Hattie still has not recovered
It was actually billions. With a B. Close to 10b. They built a soccer field and gave some money to the rich side of Haiti. Rest they kept.
Thank you Bill & Hillary for always being considered about our country. Wished the President would be as caring
President Trump donated one million dollars to charity for the hurricane damage.
@BarackObama @GeorgeHWBush @georgewbush 
All well and good, but if we had a real President this would not be necessary. 
#ImpeachTrump
America now has to fight injustice in our govt the Russians and govern ourselves as well right down to caring for our fellow citizens
I know, right? Have never felt so unprotected as a citizen.
Agreed it Almost feels like it's our responsibility to care for the people who survived the hurricanes. It's like we are totally on our own
hello
hello
It's good to hear encouragement and support from our former leaders. It's not like we're getting it from our current so called leader.
BUT NOTHING compares TO THE EVIL DEATH & DESTRUCTION OF ILLEGAL FAKE WANNABE 45 donny trumputin AND HIS RAG TAG GOP POLITBURO DICTATORSHIP !
Make AMERICA rid of D. tRuMp!!!! Mr Robert Mueller please hurry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is there money to be made here? Haiti money running low?
Hao are you Mr and ms clinton
Good naught
I voted for both of you & I want to hear from both of you.

Can you please let the rightful 45th President know we want to hear her voice?
Never thought of looking back with so much gratitude. They remain as a beacon of light to help guide the way.
I like that all the Presidents do videos like this together, despite political difference. Great example to everyone!
thanks. Bill. Ignore the fools who speak negative.
He and Hillary have been ignoring & threatening his rape victims for decades!

Donate some of the Haiti funds
They talk a bunch of $h!t & do NOTHING!
Glad they locked the door so Trump couldn't get in the photo
Weeping.. God bless you.  We need your leadership at this time.
Damn.

I saw a rapist...a terrorist loving  traitor..a peanut salesman...and Jeb Bush's brother and father...in that order.

The bar is low.
yes indeed!
Great to see our Presidents together. In this time of devastation & divide it's wonderful to see us comin together as Americans, one nation.
@jimmykimmel 5 USA presidents allowed North Korea to B Nuclear Power threatening United States & its Allies #TakeAKneeNFL Bow to Kim Jong-un
Send the money you never gave Haiti 

What happened? 
Here is a reminder.
#NeverForget #September11 
Hillary...Bill..Chelsea...just go away, please, just go away. No one ever wants to see another Clinton on TV, books, magazines, etc....ever!
Liar LIAR ???

Are you planning to steal this money like you did in Haiti?
What happened to all the Haiti??????????
Sorry .. we don't fund crooks
POTUS 45 is doing a great job keeping on top of taking care of things with the hurricanes. Better then any recent president has done by far!
You and crooked wife are sad reflections of our country. Keep your wife in check with saying Trump and white supremacist. She lost. Go away!
Bill Clinton Is Involved In The One America Appeal? Are You Sure About This? 
#Clintofoundation #Haiti #CrookedHillary #billClintonisarapist
You’re a #criminal with no #credibility.
I'm hope every body safety.
Hi
Here in Lakeland 45 min inland from Tampa. We are first timers with FL hurricanes...God Protect US All. Also, checking on elderly neighbor!
Despite any political views you may have, we gotta put our morality above our beliefs and help out. Every little bit of anything counts.
@GeorgeWBush__ @BarackObama @GeorgeHWBush @JimmyCarter39th could not be more proud! #OneAmericaAppeal
The people in Haiti are still waiting for their money you bilked them out of! Makes you a liar, a rapist and a damn lowlife thief
. Seriously? 
Thank you for showing how Presidents Reapond and come together.
So you can steal more money like you did in Haiti and let's nof forget the children you tried to steal
P.S. - How much of this goes to Clinton Foundation?
And let's remember that the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are all US citizens who need our help and support.
All these storms are God's judgement on this country for the evil we've allowed! We need to repent and get saved, now is the time!
Thank you for demonstrating how all Americans work together regardless  of party affiliation.
Be safe everyone.

ATTENTION ALL CLINTONS
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME IN ANY 
HURRICANE RAVAGED AREA
 #OneAmericaAppeal #HAITI 
…
Heck!! No!! Nothing with YOUR name on it Bill Clinton
It pleases me to see our former Commanders together to deliver a powerful and unifying message. We need their leadership now more than ever!
.@BarackObama  @BillClinton  Go presidents! 
THIS! 
Thank you President Bill Clinton for your support. Let's all help those who are in need of support. #HurricaneHarveyRelief
Hi Mr President and Hilary. I'm in Florida we are next with another one behind Irma. Texas devastating. sad. I pray I'm not nextpreparedtho
Thank you to these great leaders...#OneAmericaAppeal
REPREHENSIBLE
Thank you for coming together for the greater good... hopefully it's contagious!
What I love most about this is that TRUMP is conspicuously missing, by design? who knows but I look at these men and I am proud 2B American
Class acts all.
We live in central FL and have to stay in home.three neighbors looking out for each other. Just hope wind doesnt blow homes apart. Stay safe
Awesome!!
I pray to God that all the victims of the Hurricane Harvey overcome the loss of life and property, soon.
If Bill and Hillary Clinton are involved rest assured the people earmarked to receive the help will get as little as legally possible.
Nice work
It's good to see the faces of actual Presidents after the orange incompetent shitshow we've currently got taking up space in our White House
Thank you real Presidents!
Just returned from a Red Cross deployment to Texas I agree Texas is got a big heart.
This is what a real President looks like!  A great message for tragic times!
Beautiful.
Haiti is still waiting for hurricane relief funds collected by the Clinton Foundation! What a scam that was.
Please stay away. We are still recovering from the damage you and your wife has caused us.

I would take anyone of you,or any combination... Save is from Dr. Evil and his mini me's-(Obama is the only one who'll get that reference)

#OneAmericaAppeal
The people of Haiti are still waiting for their money you stole from them.
Yea ,maybe your foundation could help some of the people out like you did in Haiti.
What happened to hillious monies
Traitor terrorist Obama   and Bill the Rapist. 
 Both are  CORRUPTS
Where is the money for  poor victims of Haiti?

Jimmy Carter a known anti-semite, Obama a known muslim apologist, Bush Jr/Sr, invented global terrorism!
Shoot the world, tell us what you already know about the aliens
@HillaryClinton I vote no...At least to your appeal. I happily donated to the #lds church to provide humanitarian aid, not you!
Where's money to help rebuild ? Must be in the same place all that money that was suppose to go to Haiti
"Americans"???? Surely you jest! Treasonous "Americans" if anything.
billy clinton you shattered homes and lives. how is hillary after the hit.
You guys were awesome presidents not like tiny fingers I'm in Canada so I can say whatever I want lol lol
