Everything's bigger in Texas. 
Fun pic. We need all ex-prez 2 unite, save U.S. Why not seek Electoral College revote due 2 Russia, elect popular vote winner?
That would take a constitutional amendment. ...those usually take 5 to 10 years to pass
Where in Constitution does it explicitely ban Electoral College Revote? (Let alone anticipate foreign interference w/aid by U.S. candidate?)
it doesn't allow it
That's not true. It doesn't address it. There are lots of articles on how the election can still be reversed...
Nope
Please  cite where the Constitution bars an Electoral College revote. 
"Nope" doesn't cut it.
Please state where it allows a revote?
@RCPerryman_Esq
No one enjoys life as much as a former president. so much glee in being done with that job.
And here I thought Sean Spicer was the only member of government to hide between the bushes...
*among*
It's "between two," and in this case correct. #themoreyouknow

Fake prepositions.
He is not so tall in the real life.

"Take cover!" 
When your girlfriend predicts the future on your trip to Dallas weeks before a former president posts a similar photo
hhaha
since you're hidding behind his shadow, means that you are higher rank than little Bush? In my "legacy", the highest ranks are first line. 
@JulieThannum @KleinISDChelsea @JustinElbertPR have you seen this? ^^ LOL
Haven't been to the library yet but I saw the pic 
LOL.  
That man has the best sense of humor. Something lacking in the current era.
@potus @GeorgeHWBush @dallascowboys @kaepernick7 @nfl It is to scale.  It's the ratio that's off.  HAHA
Really, they're big, big nothing!
LOL! A President with a sense of humor is SO refreshing. Please come back to the WH and bring the REAL President with you!!! 
@potus @GeorgeHWBush @dallascowboys @nfl Not everything!

I'm in Belfast, Northern Ireland today where Bill Clinton brought peace to the country and he's considered to be the best US president.
Only man ! Not woman

That's what they all say
I do hope that the Republican 'cojones' are bigger than Trumpism! This can't go on further. Either stand against this shit of lose your job!
Bill Clinton spoofing Sean Spicer hiding in the Bushes

Pretty darn cool Sir.
Their accomplishments were equally exaggerated.
Glad to see some presidents have a sense of humor.

We see you as much bigger as a president than trump. No one is perfect, but I'll take you over trump.
Damn Bill!!!
Well, we all know you have large hands, Mr President.
Something political made me smile. Thanks. It's too few and far between these days.
Kind of like that cigar. Larger than life

Uh, no...not everything!
dude funny as hell haha

A Bill in the hand is worth two in the Bush

we almost had this man as our first husband!!! what a joyous world that would've been... my heart breaks thinking about it.
Instead of getting a 2 for 1 special on Presidential experience/knowledge, we got a buffoon under Russian control sitting in the WH today.
This is the best! 
That's awesome, Mr. President!
BILL!
Please help Trump
Hmmm aren't we still fighting the wars they started?
hee hee hee
Look a rapist behind Bushes!
I was going to read the comments. But I didn't feel like wading through all the troll shit.
Three of the best men! Thankful for your leadership and sense of humor! If only you could come back
As you know from being one, presidents are larger than life. ;-)

@TayNorberg @fixmylogin 
old enough to remember a time when we had presidents smart enough to have a sense of humor. #Bush #Clinton #Bush #Obama
The one time you won't get in trouble for being photographed with your face in between two giant boobs. (Sorry, had to)
Doesn't matter what side your on, this is funny
Wish you could take over as President!
Love, love, love!
Ya did good.
Okay, you're just adorable.
Your too Funny Mr.President.
@HuffPostPol @CBSNews @foxandfriends @foxnewspolitics Voters across country! PROTEST this corrupt GOP dictatorship! Get to the streets!

@POTUS44 @realDonaldTrump @foxnewspolitics @foxandfriends @HuffPostPol @CBSNews @thehill @washingtonpost @UDelaware we need obama BACK!

Love it but be careful of Texan trump supporters, they are HUGELY corrupt!

It is if you're talking moral stature.

Really enjoyed your conversation with President Bush. Some interesting insights.
I love you Mr @billclinton best President ever
I live close by, wish I had the honor of meeting you. Dude, tell me you got a Whataburger while in town. Misplaced Valley Girl living in TX.
Wish you could be President again!!! We could use you now more than ever.
The stars at night are really bright    deep in the heart of Texas ...   
Love it!
43, 42, 41
Sigh. Another great President derided by those who benefit from the sweat of the poor. Miss you playing the Saxophone! Love u & HRC.

But to sale 
If you want answer charge someone being a Russia spy and you see them telling on each other
Respect you #BillClinton and #georgeWBush. This country could use your leadership now.
Greatest pic ever
I love the picture. Please round up the posey and help U.S.
It's a pretty well known fact that even their assholes are bigger in Texas....Bush, Perry, Abbott just to name a few.
AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAA
This might shock you, but if it had to be, might as well be five extra hours after dinner. I do not want to worry about children growing up+
Can you remember the first time you were caught between two bushes?



Hiding in the bush's, eh Bill?
Love it, .
