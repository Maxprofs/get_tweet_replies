Like to see what a mob bookkeeper/drug addict/gunslinger looks like?  Somebody arrested in Florida back in 1989 for Grand Theft 2nd degree?
Ladies and Gentlemen ... Ms. Theresa Strosser.  (1962 -2017).
You have to get to the end of the video where she says, 'It's just like in a movie, ah,' to realize this was only some money making con.
I saw the letter you sent Milch.  Milch who sent the mob bookkeeper/drug addict/gun slinger my way.  Milch who recommended I watch Mafioso.
My last fifteen years in #SquirrelHill is the Greatest Story Never Told.  I but know what happened.
Greetings from The Coffee Tree.  Stop by some time when I'm there.  Of course that would take guts ...


"Mr. President ... was 9/11 an inside job?"  "How dare yuuu ... "  Flight Attendant sheds new light on 9/11.
tell me: do you trolls operate inside the Internet Research Agency, or can you work from home?
Thanks for your tweet mister Clinton
Thank you so much for remaining a leader for our country. Really miss you and Obama in the Whitehouse
Heard your wife is going to prison over Benghazi.   Will you be able to make your own dinner.
Anyone who disrespects our previous leaders is ignorant to their accomplishments while in office. Trump, the most hated President in history

What a classy reply. You were a real comfort to survivors and their families reading President Clinton's words on that anniversary.
Says the man who refused to take out bin Laden and prevented all of this
What a classy reply. You were a real comfort to survivors and their families reading President Clinton's words on that anniversary.
Thank you, Mr. President. Oh, for the days when we had someone in the WH who knew what their job was. Be well, Sir.
9-11 might not have happened if you took out #OBL when you had the chance.
911 wouldn't have happen if bin Laden and the taliban didn't commit this monstrous act. Don't blame Clinton because of their evilness
This didn't happen in your term that was last peace America has had thanks to you PRES BILL CLINTON you were best president of all time!
Are you kidding Brenda. Bill failed and led to 911.
Oh please? He bombed terrorist training camps no terrorist til Bush became pres then HELL broke loose.he had us financially fit LOVE Clinton
Sometimes I often wonder if you were born with a conscience! Do you not take any responsibility for all those innocent lives lost on 911?
Thankyou sir
It was CIA behind 9/11
Osama is being with u
He is ur excess card to any oil rich country
Dnt try to make us fool we r well aware of that
Why is it...bad things happen to americans when republicans are in office. I miss you Mr. President.
Like those your wife was responsible in killing. Benghazi
Hey Clinton YOU are the reason why we elected Trump
What's up Mr. President
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ARE VISITING THE FLORIDA, TODAY.
You see the photos of you and Chelsea I posted for that time? - your face was a comfort to everyone - hope you're well - love to the family
You had 9 chances to get Osama Bin Laden prior to 9/11 according to The Road to 9/11 documentary. Why didn't you get him?  3000 people died!
Thanks...
Yeah thanks for setting up that  attack while you were president.. Go away....
Thank you, Mr President.

Remembering you chose not to take out #OsamabinLaden when you had the chance.

Bless them all.
Not our despicable, embarrassing #NarcissistInChief ...apparently today is ALL about HIM. #TrumpFILTH #Illegitimate  #StillWithHER
Must be United for the families of those who are getting killed in Burma. They are also losing their families. Not getting attention at all.
You realize that @realDonaldTrump thinks you're thanking him personally. He claims he was in the rubble "helping" with first responders
We love you Bill and thank you for this beautiful message.  Now, the U.S. needs you,  can you please come help us?
Bill would gladly like to put his cigar in your pussy...just ask @MonicaLewinsky
At least he would ask first
That's not what the others are saying...
Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Kathy Shelton, Paula Jones...just to name a few
Great hoes think alike. What came about with those allegations? Oh yeah nothing.  Good try
I do remember that Clinton had a chance to get Bin Laden!!
God forbid you touch one penny of money for victims like you and your crooked wife did in Haiti!!
I visited the crash site in Pa. Wonderful National Park ranger gave a heart rendering talk and tour of the site. Won't forget.
Those that remember see your crocodile tears.
Will you and your wife please go away. We seriously do not care about anything you have to say. Time to go out to pasture.
PRISON
This was your fault. You know that in your heart
Hey Bill! Tell Hilary hi and thanks for tweeting about 9/11! It will always be rembered!
My heart goes out to all of the families that was affected by this terrible loss. RIP to the courageous people that lost their lives. #9/11
If only someone had given you an opportunity to take out Bin Laden years before he attacked us. Oh, wait....
#C4News 

Democrats are in bed with Islamofascists.

#JimmyCarter brought infant-rapist #Khomeini to power.
