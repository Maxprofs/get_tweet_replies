Gregg Popovich has made charity work a priority in his career, and the Spurs coach gave a simple reason for it. http://es.pn/2Cbd5BD 

Your charity gives barely anything to anyone! @ClintonFdn is a SCAM
Unless you steal from the poor like the fake Clinton Foundation does.
Why would anyone listen to you? A disgraced Potus who was impeached.
Funny you would tweet anything about charity work considering the NON DISCREDITED Podesta Emails point a large finger  to the CORRUPTION in your family charity including diversion of funds for private use.


Conservatives are shown to be the most charitable people. Let's try to get these tight wad rich Liberals to get off of some of their money. And Bill, when will you apologize to the women you've raped and sexually assaulted over the years? @HillaryClinton
Conservatives and corporations have proven that they are only charitable when the president cuts their taxes by billions of dollars. That's like saying hey, I'll give $20 million to charity if the government would just give me $100 million dollars.

Money? Lots and lots of money?
So you and Pop are friends. Does he have a good stash of Energizer Bunnies like you????

Where do you people get these fake conspiracy theories at FOX right-wing propaganda network, probably? This does really sound like Trump! Trump paid a guy named Epstein to bring him 13 yr olds to have sex with though and threatened the girls if they told to kill them.
Do you have proof of this or are just slanderous to our President?
Just Google it and you can read all about it.

To whom much is given, much should be expected.

Maybe the #ClintonFoundation could match his generosity. Maybe the Clinton Family could. #PayForPlay

@SportsCenter
Strange Tweets from Bill Clinton and Hillary. No Christmas tweet and then just random retweets or generic posts from Bill and Hillary. Kqinda makes me wonder if something has affected them both? Obamas' tweets have been lacking/strange too? Wonder wats happening
Like Anyone cares what a skank/LIAR/Racketeer like you you says/thinks....? .


I don't want to follow you I don't know how to delete it?

BANISHED - The Untold Story of Danney Williams, Bill Clinton's black son from a prostitute

Pop being quoted by a rapist. He would be proud #LiberalLogic
@HillaryClinton .
Popp is the best, even took pity on me @ Pomona College and hired this wrestler to film hoops games as my financial aid work study job- and didn’t fire me after what he. Called the worst game film ever recorded in the NCAA..
@SportsCenter that is
Charity is good but distribution of wealth is even better.
@CarterLibrary to get the fullness out of my #TwitterFeed you have to read it in it's #NativeTongue #Southern like #French but less sophisticated like Baudelaire in English just doesn't #Translate so slow your #Draw and enjoy. Presidential Professor Clinton & Carter @Harvard

NEW: "Obama Family Christmas Card"

 FYI: It Had Over 1 Million Likes, 30,000 Replies, And 20,000 More Retweets Then Trump
Larry Nichols your old Arkansas handler says "Hi".
We demand that Ahed and all Palestinian children are released from Israeli prisons now. 

The international community must put an end to the ill-treatment and detention of Palestinian children. Enough is enough.

To Ahed and all the children in Israeli jails
Thanks for sharing!!!
I agree with what pop says, but the beautiful thing about this country is that you aren’t required to do it
feliz 2018


Pop, don't give you to the Clintons. Give elsewhere.
my dear son live for nothing die for something
Making another pitch for people to donate to your scam.
I have never understood how well off people don't do this - how many milliions is enough?  Help those who need help. Simple.
Is that why you kept 90% of money that was supposed to go to Haiti?
Love him!!!
Coach Pop is, and always has been...a class act!
He forgot to mention the fact that charitable contributions are a BIG TAX WRITEOFF!
1)0기준예산,2)WTO, 3)성과주의 해고의자유(경쟁주의 노무관리), 4)최소규모 행정으로 최대정부써비스제공, 5)탈냉전과 세계통일주의,6)환경보호, 등등... Total is Bill Clinton's words.But now a History ㅎㅎㅎ
시간은 빨리 지나가고 세상의 숙제는 변화무쌍,한국은 지금 일자리 때문에 최대규모의 행정&최대규모의예산&정년보장의 행정으로 사회복지와 투쟁중입니다.#NowWords
I love how all the horrible tweets to this man are riddled with misspellings.
Bill you're the last guy who should be out here talking about charity work/donations you scam artist #ClintonCrimeFoundation
More words to live by:  "I did not have sex with that woman."
Thank you! God bless WJCF!!
Yes ..
Why’d y’all steal so much from Haiti then 
Heyyyyyy President @BillClinton! I wished you and President OBama could do another term!
Best coach ever
Stick to politics Bill
What stripped tweeted this for u bill? Come on We all know u ain’t using twitter
Yes, totally agree! can you actually give the money you and the wifey get from your “foundation” to the Haitian people who need it? Also, can you let us know how you spent you vacations with Jeffrey Epstein?
You’re forgetting this post is about Popovich, right?  Don’t take away from that
Pop seems legit, don’t agree with his politics but you are correct. The context was the fact a hypocrite (Clinton family &Bush family) are crooks. 
I can disagree and respect Pop as he seems to be a man of his word. Just calling out that jabroni Clinton
Jesus. The Clinton Foundation is a criminal enterprise and you've lined your pockets off the backs of the working men and women of this country. Why don't you give some of those hundreds of millions away?
@BillClinton @henryrubme thank you for calling this out Bill. Important motto to live by.
Poor poor Billy
That's right President Clinton, San Antonio has the best coach in the league. He talks the talk and walks the walk. 

He may not say much, but he means it when he says it.

So Pop might retire after the 2020 USA Olympic basketball...wonder what else happens in 2020
Thank you, Mr President. Happy New Year to you and family. @HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton
That’s my Coach Pop! That’s my San Antonio! #PuroSanAntonio #saproud
Bill what did you get Monica for Christmas?

Mr. President regconize Danny, we all do. Now is the time. We all are getting older, and want to make it home to our Father, by doing what is right. We all must get it right. Don't worry about what might be said. Things are being said even now, just get it right please ☆
Just what @Joan_Rivers would say.
Bill it's time for you to act like the queens husband and stay quit. Personally I think you are the one who lost the election for your wife.

Too bad you have chosen not to.
Trump Doesn't have a word to live by, cause F.J. media Propaganda tell him what to say, and what to do ??? I want to learn from you Where is the Money that the Treasury of the USA print every single day $ 800, Million  GO ???
Same reason you and hrc stole all the Haiti money
Tell me about all the girls.
The sign of a true leader
Speaking of charitable endeavors, what ever happened to Laur[a] [S]ilsby?
You steal. You don't give
It's really a great time for everyone to give..  Rich or poor...give as you are able.  More than ever charities will need all Americans to give as our government ravages our support systems for the young, the poor and elderly If you can't give, consider volunteering your time.

Go to hell. Go away
My liking of this tweet is in appreciation only as it refers to Coach Popovich and his good deeds; it is not to condone as a whole the person who posted this tweet, as I could never in good conscience do so.
What ever you do Pop,don’t donate to the now de-bunked #ClintonFoundation its a scam.......#ClintonCrimeFamily
Geez, you ppl STILL post crap w/o researching ANY of it!  I’m embarrassed for the ignorance you display. Perhaps why you hide behind kingrob
A best one man
please just go away
@SportsCenter Who is Coach Poop?
The most fun I have is doing acts of kindness secretly. It makes me smile when I think of people saying. Who did this? Why? I get embarrassed if people know. I don't want thanks, it feels good to help or make someone happy when I can.
Now I'm blushing. Thanks, that's awful nice of you to say.

In Pop we Trust!!!
