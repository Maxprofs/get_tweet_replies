If I were you I would remove bank account number! Not a good idea!
Ok whats the best
OK, you do what you need to do, but I don't know why anyone would put their bank acct number on twitter. Just saying. It's up to you.

But we will never forget what you did with the CIA in Mena. Exchanging drugs for guns.
Can you please save us all now?

I'm on the east coast, I have a room , you are welcome to it

His work, together w/ Perot, actually tried to make our (teachers') lives better. Sadly, Perry & Abbott have laid it all to waste.
Actually, Bush began dismantling education in Texas.
You are right. I didn't skip his wonderful input on purpose.
As a teacher, I had reached the first step on the ladder, after spending my summers in workshops & Bush ended this teacher career program.
I was brand new and working on that first step.
It was a really good way to allow teachers to advance & take the local politics out. Oh, well!
I retired this past May, just in time for Abbott & crew to screw me on insurance premiums. Texas "loves" its teachers.
I left teaching after 6 years. Went to work for the state for twice the money, half the insurance costs & better retirement. Glad I did.
Mark White was governor of Texas while I served in Arkansas. He was a good man and a terrific leader on public education. He'll be missed.
We'll turn Texas Blue again soon, sir ♡♡♡
