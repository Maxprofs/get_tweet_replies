Did you tell them how you oppose healthcare for everyone & you have a nice government funded healthcare
Reject the horrible Trumpcare health bill
@NevadaACTE Nevada HOSA students spoke with Senator Heller yesterday about Perkins funding and CTE.

#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
your fake and liar sold out the USA  and say your honest man your russian Spy like trump
Sen.Heller, these political moves are meaningless as you vote against your most vulnerable constituents by supporting the GrahamCassidyProp.
about time we teach true and useful skills, like how to deal with money, and banks, Technological skills is a most since 1979, you are late
This guy is selling Nevadan lives for campaign cash. It's sickening.

Vote No on ACA repeal bill! Last time you let us down. This is a chance to redeem yourself.
Not pictured: #DirtyDean's hands. Why? They're in Steve Wynn's pockets. And so is he.
@RosenforNevada @Lawrence Vote Out All @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Daily Attacks Against Americans by @DeanHeller @JeffFlake @SenTedCruz Nov 2018!

Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
Hopefully puts them on a path where they can get decent healthcare.  #noGrahamCassidy #yourlastterm
It's all about the money. McConnell has promised him big money from his super-pac, in order to flood our airwaves with ads.
Thank you for meeting with us! We look forward to what CTE education does for students!
won't mean a thing if they don't have healthcare / maternity benefits down the road. They'll drop right out of the workforce.
And yet, w/o healthcare, which you are trying to strip away, they will find themselves screwed the moment they get ill. #SaveACA
NEVADANS! #GrahamCassidy comes after our mothers, children, grandchildren, veterans, working families, all who ever was or will be sick.

Huh. Wife of GOP primary challenger to Dean Heller says Cassidy-Graham is "garbage" https://twitter.com/MrsT106/status/910278344410783744 …
Shame on you for pushing this heartless healthcare bill. Millions will lose their coverage and it's on you! Vote him out!!!
shame on you, Dean 
Call (202) 224-2131 and tell your Senator to stop #GrahamCassidy. Rumor is they have the votes. Only we can stop it.
Wise up, support our President Trump
How about listening and meeting with voters? No? tick tock...elections are coming
Start packing- 18 you are gone!
How about a NO vote on repealing our healthcare!!!!!
Graham Cassidy allows insurance companies to charge more for pre existing! Cuts Medicaid expansion for NV , gives to other states
@GovSandoval is not signing off on this horrible bill, as you insisted in June! Cuts spending for healthcare, Heller is lying
Too bad you want to take away all of their Healthcare. As well as millions of others.
Time for you & many others to be voted out!

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
@SenDeanHeller "If you want my support . . . You gotta make sure the Republican governors that have expanded Medicaid sign off on it."
YOU TOOL
Cardboard cutout Dean Heller.
But you voted for an Ed. Sec. that only cares about increasing her income from student loans and charter schools.  Cutting Ed. hurts kids.
You know what helps students later in life? Being able to get health coverage at those jobs the technical ed. helped them get #Hellercare
Shame on you. You know this healthcare bill hurts your constituents!
You should be brushing up your resume, because after the election in November 2018, you're going to be needing a job in the private sector.
Thanks @SenDeanHeller this picture of you smiling with a couple kids will totally make us forget that you destroyed Nevadans' healthcare.
If you dont vote down healthcare this time, like the vast majority of us want. You will not be relected
Persons 65 years and over, living in Nevada percent, July 1, 2016, (V2016) = 15%   (US Census)
Pretty big voting bloc dean... #goodbye2018
Photo ops are kind of meaningless when you're about to screw millions of people who simply just wanted their families to have healthcare!
You voted in support of Betsy DeVos, you're a hypocrite.
Did you explain that they should never go into business for themselves because they won't be able to afford healthcare because of YOU??
You tell them to never lose that job or else they will go broke from healthcare costs?
.@SenDeanHeller I feel as though we Nevadans eat as much shit as your grin does.
Healthcare will benefit them too
Tell about job-training cause you are gonna need it.
Too bad Republicans are anti public practical schools and pro religious ideological schools.
Another photo op!  On a roll today to make us try to forget your spineless vote for DJT healthcare. You are a shameful .  Stop scamming us.
Please vote No in the ACA repeal bill. Thank you.
I see you are a nurse also. We see firsthand the impact of lack of health insurance on individuals and families. Repubs seem deaf.
He's co-sponsoring this sham of a "healthcare" bill. His name is on it. He's a YES. He's already betrayed us.
Until they get sick.....
You vote yes on Trumpcare 2, hurting Nevadan's, you're toast.
Met with Nevadans who are so concerned about your support of the "healthcare" bill that is bad for Nevadans and the US. R only recourse #bye
Access to healthcare is important as well. So they can have careers. And families. And lives.
Another thing that benefits people is access to affordable high quality health care. Reject #GrahamCassidy.  We deserve better.

Did you ask them if they have pre-existing conditions that will make them difficult to insure under your bill?
Heller voted to take Medicaid away from 200k, defund Planned Parenthood,& begged constituents not to boo at town halls(which he didn't hold)

Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions.
