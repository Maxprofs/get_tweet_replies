And I don't get that is so FANTASTIC!  What did you expect?  Bizarre that you've been so complimentary.
did you think he wouldn't? Scary.
so the @TheNVIndy reported that you are down in Texas learning about the "wall" instead of meeting with Nevadans. 
You voted for every one of Donnies cabinet from hell. I'm voting democrat or independent in 2018.
@ Problem is he may not be opposed. Deadline to run is <2 months.
Please accept my apology. Not sure why I thought <2 months. I reread @RalstonReports.
Is there any organize opposition to heller? Maybe we can get him to switch party affiliation.
Article mentions several potential candidates. Problem is Ralston says Heller doesn't lose.
I believe Heller was appointed by Sandoval when Ensign resigned. So he wasn't even elected to the senate.
I am begging you to please OPPOSE H. J. RES. 69
stop acting like you care or had anything to do with this pretend senator who's scared to meet with us
We see you and your voting record in administration appointing shameful stand up for Nevada
And you have helped him. The stain on you is forever.
And it's a permanent orange stain #TownHallMeetingNow #StopRunningAndFaceTheMusicHeller #2018
No time for your constituents? You'll have plenty of time after 2018 to start that job search #Smarmy #Skeered
see ur game-keep #alt45 in while tea party dismantles govt-then act shocked & oust him 4 dictator pence. We are watching.
yay! Now could you look into the news that he's accepting bribes from Russia?

Where are you hiding? It is time to engage with NV residents, can't hide forever-
yes it is.  Please hold real town hall. Tele- town hall not the same for we the people. Being muted isn't participation.
I understand you don't want to break from your party but please be a decent human being and OPPOSE H. J. RES. 69
Presidents do diaster relief.  Don't change the subject.11 million to protect Trump & his family for one month?

This is expected.  Investigate Russia  !  Investigate personal business and Trump the President.
should be expected by a president,  not surprised.
Great! Oh- thought you were announcing your town hall in #LV. Crickets... #2018iscoming
will the payment be in Russian rubles or USD Comrade Heller?
Do a town hall coward
He needs to do more GOOD things, stop spending our $ making himself feel good, stop lying and get to work. We deserve better.
Now DEMAND HE DO THE SAME FOR CALIFORNIA OUR NEIGHBORS FAMILY AND FRIENDS U WORM
Appropriate & mature of Trump. Also, he approved CA's request for FEMA funds. At least he's done something.
are you going to make yourself available to your #Nevada constituents? We are demanding an in-person #TownHall
oh hey!  It's Dean Heller. Thought u we're in witness protection. I have ur countdown clock to 2018 running.
Doesn't make @POTUS brilliant. Any president would/should do this. Get on board with @SenJohnMcCain.
That is great we need all the help. Thanks!!!
Of course, that is what President should do.  Don't change the subject.  What about RUSSIA ?
is this b4 every human, animal, tree is destroyed? Stop supporting greed & put country & People of Nevada b4 party!
Townhall in Las Vegas?
when is the Town Hall?
where's our town hall? Are you just gonna run out the clock until we replace you in '18? #DumpHeller #TheResistance
So Senator Heller in Storey County (population <4K) & avoinding Clark County (population >2M)
thanks for reminding us how the government helps us, Mr. We don't need the federal govt. Only when it suits you
what did you promise to give 45 in return?  Oh yeah, You've voted FOR every nominee AND legislation he wants PIF
It is not fantastic news that he tweeted that the press is the enemy of the American people.  Un-American.
Have you noticed he's also made fear and chaos available?
wow great. Now investigate Trump's. Or get out. You don't represent NV.
Are you even in NV for district week? Your weekly telephone town hall cancelled. No in-person meetings scheduled. Where r u?
but #ClimateChange is #FakeNews? How about a reality check, Dean? All about cutting taxes, wheres the money from
I am deeply saddened by that you are not holding a #townhall during recess to engage with us Nevadans
Over 200 Republicans decided to hide from constituents next week instead of hosting town halls
here is the worthless person you voted yes to for @usedgov   @BetsyDeVos is not a friend of education http://wapo.st/2lVpjXo 
fantastic news is Gov Sandoval won't use natl guard to round up immigrants. Will you ever speak out for decency sir?
Called your office to ask about town hall. Was told you don't have time. You don't have time For Nevadans. Shock
No thanks to you. Stop aggrandizement of every decision made. You do not support Nevadans. No Heller 2018.
are you holding any town hall meetings during recess? You keep tweeting. You keep ignoring us. I'll keep asking.
Carson City 2/22 Chamber of Commerce lunch @ Gold Dust West w/ Heller & Amodei
https://news.vice.com/story/more-than-200-republicans-in-congress-are-skipping-february-town-halls-with-constituents â€¦.  There it is there. Shouldn't be surprised by this. Heller is one of the 200+
See you Tuesday, we're not going away until you go away in 2018.
Heller & Amodei to dine with $$$Doners @ Carson City Chamber of Commerce Wed 2/22, 11-1. Where is r Town Hall?
When do we get a townhall sir?  Thank your staff for the BS cut and paste letters with your rubber stamp signature.
just fantastic new dean. Do you have any clue how mad you are making Nevada voters in your (lack) of action and
your refusal to have a #TownHall meeting in #vegas #reno #elko? Ur votes to fill the swamp with slime speak volumes of who
your priorities rest with and it is not the Nevada voters. If it was, you would communicate and listen to what we are saying
but you can't seem to take the time to do that. #dumpheller2018 #worthless #investigatetrump #democracy
The @GOP @realDonaldTrump haven't gutted Fema great news
Heller stay out of the way your votes are bad
. @SenDeanHeller @fema what about help for flint and their water issues? Where's your head at, you selfish disaster of a senator?
Where is the townhall you owe us? Did you forget you work for NV...not the other way around? #votehellerout
great news, cuz it was just as likely he was going to nuke us
we'll get FEMA asst after nuclear strike.
Trump finally did what the law required him to do and @sendeanheller praises him. Classic authoritarian govt example.
Republicans havent killed FEMA yet? Heller has all weekend to visit LV. ANY word? of course not. Hail King Trump
Good. Now, when will YOU be available for a meeting with your constituents? We have much to discuss. #TownHall
We still have a FEMA?!? Phew!
that's on the chopping block also, the 75% of fed funds after a disaster will go away. Heller also
Dean. DEAN. Are you trying to make us go crazy? Time for a town hall, boo bear. @potus is your golden cow it seems.
