Why is Draft Dodger "Bone Spurs" Trump determined to balance the budget at expense of brave Vietnam Disabled Vets? http://www.amvets.org/amvets-deeply-concerned-presidents-proposed-cuts-veteran-benefits/ …
LVMPD is doing a great job & is very much appreciated!
Nevadans cannot be safe if AHCA passes.
Counting on your conscience for NV & US #HandsOffHealthcare
No mandate but requires coverage of pre-existing conditions?  That will make insurance way too expensive-true death spiral...
Yeah, but what about healthcare?  That's important too! Are you going to keep Nevadans safe by voting no on trumpcare?  
Good job.
Please don't condemn millions of Americans to death. Do you really want to see children dying who could have been saved?
Take your propaganda elsewhere.
Keep America safe with #TrumpRussiaCollusion investigation.  What is Ivanka doing in the white house ? .@SenCortezMasto
I'm a LV resident.  Take care of us on healthcare.
Great now pay attention to healthcare! #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
