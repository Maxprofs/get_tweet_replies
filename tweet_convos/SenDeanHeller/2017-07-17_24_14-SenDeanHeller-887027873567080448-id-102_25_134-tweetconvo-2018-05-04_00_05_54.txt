Nice, but how about you repeal obama care now. The voters will speak.
How about protecting xtnd Medicaid 4 the PEOPLE OF NEVADA!!!!
In spite of the (spiteful) Prez, you should work w/Dems to fix #ACA for all Americans...
Every Senate Democrat signed a letter to Rs saying: we want to work w/ you to address flaws of #ACA. Let's work together & get this right.

Save healthcare for millions. Vote NO.
What about getting your NO vote off to Washington? That would relieve thousands of your "beloved" Nevadans in need of continuing health care
A better plan would have been to renounce Trumpcare on Monday morning instead of playing coy waiting to see what others would do.
But you have zero time for any constituents who try to meet with you in your office in DC or Nevada?  #Sad #HellerNo
Thanks to each and every one of you that called, marched, raised your voices, were arrested, and participated by resisting!   U ALL
Please Senator, be an American hero and say no to repeal and or replace.  Americans across the US are begging this of you

@SenDeanHeller traitors everywhere patriots let us never forget 2018 will be upon us and we will do away with these traitors to the USA 
@GovSandoval do the two of you see a theme here?  The ACA is quite popular. Don't spoil it #4NV. Fix ACA, don't kill it.
While we are all happy you support our veterans, we'd like to see you support ALL Nevadans and work for ALL of us - protect healthcare!
Senator Heller, why did you waffle with your healthcare vote?
You should focus on taking health care away from non rich whites !
The BCRA prevent veterans from receiving tax credits to buy health insurance on the marketplace vote no
A better way would have been to be a HERO yourself by Repealing O-Care as promised to us voters for 7 years, then visit with our great heros
And do you want them to all die because of Trumpcare? Cuz they will and it will be on you
He knows. Needs to prove he cares.
Amen!
This is a good way too ...?
Not sure people have picked up on the fact that the hand gesture Trump gave Putin at the G20 is "bro" for "we're solid" or "let's be solid." 
Town hall in Las Vegas do you have time for that
I'm poor and cannot afford to use my employee based hc because deductible too high.  You should've gone alone with Cruz plan.  NOW REPEAL
Photo ops are nice, but Senator Heller i'd rather hear that you were fighting for affordable health care and a balanced budget.
A Firm No would make a great Tuesday: http://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2017/07/17/we-visited-heller-dc-and-told-him-bill-would-kill-vivian-leal/485973001/ …

Heller was a no until billionaire casino magnate Steve Wynn threatened him almost daily. What a sad, perfect example of money in politics.
Taking pictures and shaking hands is not enough, you need to vote to support vets and American families.
REPUBLICANS AND TRUMP TRYING TAKE AWAY PENSIONS FROM 181 THOUSAND VIETNAM PTSD VETERANS REPUBLICANS TRAITORS TO AMERICAN VETERANS
You'll have plenty more time to hang out in a parking lot after the next election. I hope catching #trump #farts was worth it. #FartCatcher
Did the marijuana trade off blackmail get to you! Better stand straight n tall! We watch!
Can't think of a better day than you coming out against the repeal of affordable healthcare and Medicaid for thousands of Nevadans
A better day for me would be if you vote NO on Trumpcare!!!
Me too. http://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2017/07/17/we-visited-heller-dc-and-told-him-bill-would-kill-vivian-leal/485973001/ …
Please don't vote for repeal only or repeal and replace if it has any Medicaid cuts or if it gives huge $breaks to the wealthy
Dean, ALL of your constituents are heroes.
DO THE RIGHT THING FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S HEALTH. VOTE AGAINST THIS HORROR. WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND A VOICE.
Don't take their healthcare away
You can become one of our country's heroes by rejecting the pressure that Trump & McConnell will exert & remain firmly opposed to Trump Care
That's fine, now vote to fully repeal ACA and defund Planed Parenthood. Thank you ,you have a nice day now ya hear.
What a wonderful campaign photo op no repeal and replace and lower my health insurance costs
stand tall work for the people and REJECT #TrumpCare!
Please advise your constituents when and where we can meet you in person so you are aware of our wants and needs. Thanks.
Please do not cave. We need you to remain strong. We need a hero among the GOP. They are too hard to find anymore in that party.
But, you are afraid to have town halls with your constituents
DO THE RIGHT THING BY THESE VETS AND VOTE NO IN TRUMPCARE
Do the right thing. Stand on right side of history. #ProtectOurCare
How about announcing a NO vote on #GOP #HealthcareBill so that heros families w/preexisting conditions don't die from preventable illness
Please Mr. Heller stand with the people once again. #CountryOverParty  #SaveMedicaid #SaveOurCare #NoAHCA

Your vote will be remembered for years to come. Choose wisely, and remember who you represent. Thx
The #heroes of Nevada are in DC today, being arrested at your office for asking you to #KillTheBill #ShameOnYou http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-health-care-protests_us_596d04ece4b010d77672f70d …
how will you be voting on TRUMPCARE? Keep your promise to Nevadans! Vote NO on TRUMPCARE!!
Senator, my parents will die if you vote yes on the healthcare bill. Not exaggerating... please don't make them regret voting for you.
You must say NO to Trumpcare. Nevadans deserve better than you.
That's awesome, but if you would push the repeal of Obamacare, yeah that would be good!
Then don't vote to destroy our healthcare
Thank you for sponsoring S 66, to repeal the Disabled Veterans Tax. Everyone should write their Senators to repeal of this unfair tax
Hope you vote no on the healthcare. It REALLY targets Vets especially on Medicaid and Medicare
I am a veteran & hope you'll vote YES to repeal & replace the ACA.
Nevadans on Medicaid will not get care of @SenMajLdr has his way.
Yes and those heroes NEED their Healthcare! Rememberthat. I'm really trusting you to do the right thing here. Ask urself WWJD!
So take some of their strength, grow a set and vote your state's conscience--NO 2 latest GOP hlth bill. You displayed early strength. Focus!
From a Vet, thanks for kind words. Now, get back to DC and repeal repeal repeal. Don't care if it helps or hurts ur reelection.
#HellerVoteNo on BHCA. Nevada is depending on you. Close race coming up- don't mess this up for us. And you.
Please promise you will vote NO on Trumpcare. Please.
Please don't let the people in Nevada down: NO to any Medicaid cuts. People over Party.People over Party.


How about spending time in Clark County at a public event to discuss current issues like healthcare #SaveMedicaid
Just make sure these heroes have great, affordable healthcare. That'll be the best way to repay them.
If you care about veterans and Nevada, you will vote NO on the health bill. Keep your promise to women and to Nevada.
That's a good start! Just don't forget to vote NO. Have a nice day
How many of these constituents will lose health coverage if you vote for #Trumpcare ?
So I can assume that you are out celebrating and doing photo ops that you will be voting NO on the nit so new health bill? Your party=DEATH!
So true Sir.  Please don't ever stop putting real people first in your public work. One thing binding us all is the need for health care.
So don't vote to take Medicaid away from Nevadans.
Vote no on healthcare. Also, you sick of your boy trump yet?
Please don't take life saving healthcare from your consituents to please rich donors.
I was born in Reno and have family in Carson City. We are united in our opposition of #trumpcare. Don't vote for this failure
Hundreds of thousands of America's heroes in #Nevada are waiting for you to announce that will will not slash #medicaid

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 


Well this is just a tad bit awkward...
