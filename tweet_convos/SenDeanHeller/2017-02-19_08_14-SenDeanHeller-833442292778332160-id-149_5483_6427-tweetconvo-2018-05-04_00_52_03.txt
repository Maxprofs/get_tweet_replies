I would have assumed public land is always free. Hence the word public. Am I not the public?
of the 400+ parks, only 120 charge entrance fees, which fund visitor improvements that aren't possible with appropriations alone
A somewhat flawed but seemingly effective course of action. If it works, then I suppose I would not mind a fee to see.
We understand. Here's where @YellowstoneNPS's fees go in the park:
Valid cause then. Infrastructure is important  Pleasure doing business with you, Sir or Madame US Dept of Interior
@Shelster011 "public lands are free" shouldn't they be always? Who sold them to you, who ever owned them?
We pay to protect them. And they need it.
that land has been there forever, it did fine before people and it'll do fine after people.
It's the people it needs protecting from. (Especially if you consider corporations to be "people")
like I said the land will be fine, even if we cut down everything, 200 years from now the forest would be back.
entrance fees fund visitor improvements that aren't possible w/ appropriations alone
It goes to things like repairing roads, upgrading campgrounds + more:
.@Interior @jayjensix Which makes people appreciate what we have and want to preserve (and if necessary, protect) it. Thank you USDI!
I think all public lands should be free for all tax-paying citizens every day.

didn't know that! Is there a link I can use to look up the parks that charge and those that don't? BTW, 400 National Parks in US?
Great landmark! Where is it located?
It's the @GrandCanyonNPS in Arizona
Thank You @Interior for protecting public land and making it available to everyone https://thankyou.delivery/deeds/06bd0889-006b-43d8-a600-3f094aa54212 …
Thank you for loving public lands!
I'll be visiting @steamtownnhs tomorrow with my 3 train-loving boys! Can't wait- thanks!! A gem in our backyard! #Scranton

I like it!!! It's everyone's natural right to enjoy parks and nature! Thank you, I had no idea.
wish there were some neat Ohio 
Cuyahoga National Park
aww, that's still 3+ hours from me  thanks!!
Old Man's Cave area
Next time, you could also consider wildlife refuges or national forests!
Thank You @Interior for protecting public land and making it available to everyone https://thankyou.delivery/deeds/06bd0889-006b-43d8-a600-3f094aa54212 …
thanks for loving public lands as much as we do!
That's great for the unemployed. How about moving the 1 day to a week-end day!? 
we offer fee free weekends through the year: https://www.doi.gov/blog/free-entrance-days-public-lands-2017 …
We hope you can take advantage of at least one day!
Good to know.. Thanks!
beautiful
@SenDeanHeller KEEP IT FREE!!!
Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/Interior/status/833349001969856513 … (Ranked 7th for Feb 19.)
@JackinKeyWest AMERICA the beautiful .
Keep all Nevada "Public Lands in Public Hands."
bring your kids.  Leave them unattended, it's very safe.
@SenDeanHeller please stop hiding. Please have an in person town hall so we can better understand your 100% support  of Trump.
How can I reach our President about his impact on our environment? I know how he can #MAGA! Restore Hetch Hetchy
@SenDeanHeller Then why are you trying to sell public land and have oil interests drilling in national parks? #OldYellerHeller
@SenDeanHeller Where are you hiding in President Day? No meetings with constituents, open dialogue? Can't hide til 2018
are your free for a town hall?  Your constituents are asking you.  Remember us???
I would like Glacier  NP, please. Put me down for 100 acres.
soon, in honor of the trump presidency, everyone will take a gallon of oil and dump it in a park to celebrate pres day
@SenDeanHeller how soon before u sell off these public lands for oil, animal agriculture, or strip mall's? Stop supporting greed
@ThenScorpio 
NOOOOO
.@SenDeanHeller Thanks for the heads up Dean. Now keep those lands PUBLIC!
enjoy before Heller and Trump sell them to Ghina
@SenDeanHeller yes. Until you and Amodei work to privatize them.
We'd better enjoy them while we have them, cause Congress is selling them off to the highest bidder!
http://doi.gov 

@TessaDuvall So Trump has resorted to just giving away all the public lands now.
Sneaky phallic symbol! "@Interior: Tomorrow all public lands are free for Presidents’ Day. RT to spread the word! "
@BretLasky Problem solved.
Please go soon...before the oil derricks and green foamy water take over.
@POTUS    give the land that the criminals in the fed govt stole BACK TO THE STATES !
Due to 100% chance of no President 
@Interior @gdead
Where are you ?  Reno needs a town hall meeting.  You work for us, not the Republican Party.  Did you forget this ?
@laureldavilacpa just wish we were free from this president too!
Enjoy while you can before Trump et al decides to privatize them..
@JJohnson2u 
Until they are given away to a tRump peer.
that is worth protecting
@robertpatrickT2 This is the only good thing about Presidents' Day.  It's wonderful!
Awesome!!!! Keep up the great work! Nature is so amazing! #nationalparks #science #nature
Obama inherited a mess, while you discredited
@GrandCanyonNPS and people take them up in their offer!
We NEED our public lands.  Don't let Trump Administration take them away from us.  AND climate change IS real.
@KSoltisAnderson All national parks will have the name Trump attached.
@sdvicto  I will not be celebrating Presidents' Day this year or for the next 3 years until Trump is out!
I agree with you, but I will be thinking of the REAL Presidents; Lincoln, Washington, Reagan  . . not this Fake puppet
That's one way to look at it. But the more it's celebrated the more Teump will think it's because of him!
I know. The fat head. Still will see it only Washington's Bday https://www.google.com/amp/www.biography.com/.amp/news/presidents-day-facts?client=safari …
@NASCAR_Hula  good thing- we may not have them much longer if congress has its way
As long as they're not free for the President to grab. Mighty fine real estate; needs a casino.
.@Interior Go see them before they get sold to the highest (or best connected) bidder.
don't tell big oil, they'll start drilling.
@SenDeanHeller Lets enjoy them while we can until the GOP sells them all off.
HOORAY!
@SaintPetersblog Sort of sick when land gets grabbed by gov't. Goodbye private ownership. Hello, tax deductions!
@SaVonniYestanti   Visit while you still can!!!
As we Honnor all or President's.
I hope that millions of us stop this by bringing down any company trying to take them!
@SenDeanHeller go now, before they mine the Grand Canyon for uranium..
Now you just have to get there! ;)
go visit before they #selltheland
As in "Free for the taking?" Or do we have to pay Trump or one of his kids or something?
the fact that we have to pay to use the public lands, is both offensive and wrong. Those lands belong to Us as much as US
@geo_lesley you're celebrating this?
Get out and go enjoy them now while you can.
Explain to Trump that "free" does not mean free for the taking.
The day after tomorrow, they're up for sale to Corporations that have buddies in the GOP, so hurry up!
See them before they're sold off for development to make up for some of the $6-$9 trillion tax cut for the wealthy.
@pwnallthethings When you say RT to spread the word, are you referring to Russia Today? Just askin' for a friend.
thank you for being there for us
hey @MichaelMarinus This seems like the most ironic tweet ever!!!
@Susan_Hennessey Exxon will take Yellowstone...
@Susan_Hennessey Do you mean to loggers, drillers and hunters or just people looking to enjoy nature?
@michikokakutani this has to stop http://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2017/02/u-s-house-sanctions-killing-hibernating-bears-wolf-pups-dens-federal-refuges-alaska.html …
@gov Free?  I'll pay a hundred bucks for Mount Rushmore for exclusive ownership
@michikokakutani this has to stop! http://www.thepetitionsite.com/670/081/728/hunting-hibernating-animals-should-stay-illegal/ …
And after tomorrow, they're free to the highest bidder. RT to spread the word!
@Susan_Hennessey   Um....the lands are free, or admission to them is free?  These days the two can mean very different things.
@pitvins 
Sorry, musste lachen. Free, ..to spread the Word und President.
Schwer zu lesen im Moment. :-)
So I can just go stake my claim? Like 45 and his dependents/handlers?
And if President Bannon and his puppet Trump have their way they will be for sale on Tuesday.
next year it will all be a fracking ground
But you must show your green card 
.@Interior Access public lands for free, before @Potus gives them away for free.
#keepitpublic #publiclands
enjoy them while you can before POTUS and republican wingnuts privatize it so we can rape the land for Coal.
Beautiful picture
@scATX Better go visit them now before they're sold off and destroyed for profit!
Except where storms have closed the roads.
Last chance ever!
Last call to go see them while they still exist.
visit now before they are sold off to the highest bidder
maybe not, since Agent Orange divided US. Or at least the free part. We have to pay for trait hotels, and on tour concerts
Did you not realize not to phrase this this way?

@CliffBarackman Watch out for sasquatch.
@TylerRHelms @rytheii sad we can't adventure together again :,(
what is this place I wanna go there
pretty sure we were there tyler...  it's the grand canyon lol
ok never mind I just haven't seen that look before she must've gotten a new shade of powder for this pic
new grand canyon who dis
I am the great great granddaughter of John Muir and I was wondering if President Trump has ever been to Yosemite ?
What a blessing. Thank you.
#KeepItPublic #KeepPublicLandsInPublicHands
@gov never
@scATX free? In that case I'd like to purchase them to protect them from mining and drilling.
O! LORD! Don't tell #RexTillerson or #ExxonMobile!
#epa #climatechange #nationalparks
I thought for sure Trump would sell them, not give them away.
● NOT FUNNY ■
@LesBowen Free to visit or for drilling?
■ NOT FUNNY, WISE GUY ■
@Hlandeast keep them public and out of the hands of corporations...save our natural wonders for generations to come.
I'm planning on making sure a large pollution cloud is blocking out the sun for your enjoyment!
picnic on the White house lawn anyone?
@PrincessBravato Thank goodness for past presidents who thought about the future
Before they were stolen by the feds, public lands were free every day. This is OUR land!
lolololol
Free to use for drilling? Fracking? Whatever? Asking for some billionaire friends.
Oil companies first inline.
I think @realDonaldTrump ought to spend some alone time in @BadHombreNPS without a trail map.
the taxpayer that pays to maintain Public Land everyday gets to see Public Land without paying this one day Pay 2 see Public Land
Wow.This picture should be framed.
.@Interior does that include the White House, which is in a national park?
#thankyou for the reminder 
let's hope they will always be public land
they won't be. republicans doing away with @EPA and already undoing hunting restrictions on federal lands.
Love you guys. #keepOurParksBeautiful
