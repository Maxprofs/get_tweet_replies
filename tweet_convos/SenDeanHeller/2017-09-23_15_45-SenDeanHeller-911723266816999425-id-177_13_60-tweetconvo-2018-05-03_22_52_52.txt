Mr Heller for the love of God and Country please vote no on the health care plan. It's going to kill people who can't afford insurance!
What about all of the people of Hispanic heritage in Puerto Rico that are suffering? What are you doing for them?
I'm sure you did...did you happen to mention you're taking away their healthcare coverage over drinks#NoRepeal

Please vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill Nevada is counting on you.
It's HIS bill. He's trying to KILL US!
#DeanHeller used to say he would protect Medicaid exp & pre-ex cond coverage. His new "healthcare" bill does the opposite. No integrity
Dean Heller is a kochsucker
How did the other nazis feel about that? #gtfo
NV loses under this horrible bill @GovSandoval rejects GC! Stop quoting other governors
Kiss you one-term political career bye bye. Do you have something lined up with the Koch Bros for your new job? #Traitor #VoteNoHeller2018
I cannot tweet this enough. Doctors, hospitals, insurers ALL want Senate to reject your "sham" healthcare bill
This is an extraordinary letter by AMA, AHIP, AHA and other health industry groups on the Graham-Cassidy bill. 
Oh I know and so does the rest of the world
Reminder re why we're in this health care repeal nightmare: pressure from ultra-wealthy Republican donors. 

…
Giving responsibility 4 healthcare back to the states is not necessarily a good thing.
on health care, Graham-Cassidy would reverse 50-year trend toward minimum nat'l standards when states wouldn't act https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/graham-cassidy-obamacare-repeal-many-states-cant-shoulder-the-burden.html …

Trump emasculated you in public and Nation wide. You have been a flip flopping fool since then. Stand up and vote No.
Shame on you for supporting #GrahamCassidy
Latinos will be your worst election nightmare next year. 
No one will forget your attempt to eliminate healthcare for millions. 
Sleep Well.
Shouldn’t you be looking for a job? After your name on the Cassidy bill you are rightfully toast. I doubt even a used car dealer will hire u
Hv some guts and vote NO on Graham-Cassidy! Do right by American ppl. Trump can't hurt u as he has no cred. Duty Honor Country! Vote No!
How many people are phoning&begging you to vote yes on repeal? You have already committed political suicide. May as well vote no/be a hero.
Vote NO on the Repeal of the ACA.
WARNING - Revised healthcare bill even worse. Call #DeanHeller & let him know your disappointment in his lies to NV
Revised Obamacare repeal bill keeps deep cuts, further erodes protections http://bit.ly/2fL9DkG  
If they are #kickingIt with you they aren’t too concerned about their #HispanicHeritage #SellingOut #WayOut
How many of them will you be deporting?
Just a few of the over 50 medical groups along with our Gov. who oppose your bill. Taking healthcare from the poor is @GOP genocide.
Phony dog breath man- who is your 2nd largest donor? Health Insurance Lobby! Strip healthcare from thousands of Hispanic Nevadans? U VOTE!
don't be full, Heller can't be trusted he sold his soul to special interest , 1% and Trump. This is a photo opt! He is bad!
Give them teir deportation papers, or health care terminations...which one, or both?
Cute bolo tie! Enjoy your last year in office, Senator! Hope your #GrahamCassidy bill is a horrible failure! XOXO




Make my donors Happy Day!
Don't let #DeanHeller get away with lying about pre-ex conditions in his shameful "healthcare" bill
GOP Sen Susan Collins tells @jdickerson that Graham-Cassidy "clearly weakens" protections for people with preexisting conditions: 
Wow.  You're certainly a back-scratching "Where do I need to be to look good" kind of guy!  Too bad you have no integrity.
Follow @BrianSandoval and vote NO on overhaul of ACA. Be a hero and save healthcare. People's lives depend on it.
Did you tell them how you're working hard to raise campaign funds by agreeing to rip away their healthcare? #shamefull
Heller does not Speak for Nevadans..vote Nevada blue in 2018.
Karma
You are a dumbass racist follower
By lending your name to #GrahamCassidyBill you are condemning thousands of Nevadans to go without health care coverage. Shame on you!
You should be embarrassed #trumppuppet over lack of understanding the needs of Nevada citizens. 
.@SenDeanHeller  The people who know best about health care all oppose your evil cruel bill.  Your political career is over.
.@sendeanheller The truth is your "repeal and replace" is really "Let Them Die". This will; be the end of your political career.
@sendeanheller did you mention to them you are sponsoring a bill to take health insurance away from 30 million. Americans? Not too late.
Another photo op yet no time to talk to the millions he is about to gut healthcare from. #VoteHellerOut he is a spineless tRump puppet.
Be sure you Vote No on heslth care NV counting on you!!
Work for the people & not special interest & 1% VOTE NO on #TrumpCare!
How many Latinx constituents are you going to vote to deprive of Medicaid and health insurance?
You are a DEPLORABLE HYPOCRITE! Your Hispanic constituents want affordable healthcare not MONSTROSITY CG bill! Listen to experts! Vote NO!
No voten por ese mentiroso!
Why were you invited?  Aren't you going to kick Hispanics out of this country, even if they were born here?
Did you talk about how you are trying to ruin healthcare? Or just tacos?
Good times are here again.  You get another chance to take health care away from millions.
Thats all he lives for, take health care! Get off twitter get out of rallies away from Marlago & work on health care!!
Good for you. Get used to being called a loser.
Doubt they’re republicans.
What did you eat? Tacos, rice and beans! Essay...
Did you tell them that you’re trying to take their healthcare away? That you are the co-author of the new health bill?
But u r a Yes on #GrahamCassidy bill that will cost your state millions. Seriuously?
McCain selected palin as his vp candidate for his presidential run:  how much credibility should be given to his judgement
Just another photo op for Heller, he could care less for the Hispanics.

Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for being a hero again and again and now AGAIN
We're not going to have a great time in Nevada if Graham-Cassidy Non-Health Care bill passes. Listen to our NV Governor.
Vote no #grahamcassidy
@AmerMedicalAssn @SenJohnMcCain say No
Mom & babies lives at risk
U know I hate to say this but Trump is making clowns out of all you Republicans

JUST RELEASED: 32 million to lose coverage under Graham-Cassidy ACA repeal.

http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2017/sep/potential-effects-of-graham-cassidy …
NO ONE wants your sham of a "healthcare" plan, including doctors, hospitals, & insurers
New: Doctors, hospitals and insurers release a joint statement condemning Graham-Cassidy. "The Senate should reject it," they say. 
And by you voting for the graham Cassidy bill will most likely end their health care. Don’t be bullied, stand up to them and vote no.
Then you deported their relatives?
that is exactly the number of Hispanics who are going to vote for you in 2018.   Maybe.   less
Then #VoteNOGrahamCassidy !
Why would they have wanted you there?

I hope they didn't believe anything you promised!
Dean, get lost.
Did you tell them how excited you are to deport their friends and families?
Isn't is strange no one who follows u wants the HC bill.
One spanking by the baboon in the WH and u rollover against the people of N.V.
@SenDeanHeller You're trying to kill Nevadans with this so called HEALTH CARE BILL You know it doesn't cover pre-existing YOU'RE LYING TO US
This doesn't distract us from the fact that you're trying to take healthcare from 1000s of Nevadans.Just shows us that it doesn't bother you
He apparently doesn't want to keep his job in 2018. I remind him all the time to get his resume ready
GOP healthcare strategy: We're going to give you a bowl of shit and tell you it's chocolate ice cream. And you better eat every spoonful.
2018....TIC TOC
No comment on tRUMP's latest vile rants? Please stand up for what's right
#poser
Sure you'd be the one to support illegal immigrants
vote NO on graham healthcare!!!!
Why isn't #DotardTrump telling us how he is going to rebuild and pay for the three horrific hurricanes we have had in the last month?

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  #p2 #TNTweeters #USlatino

THEY'RE DOING THIS FOR A TAX CUT FOR THE RICH.

THAT'S IT.

…

President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
@SenDeanHeller are you happy with this? Just one of thousands that are counting on you to vote NO! POTUS is worthless!!!
How did they take it that you are trying to take away their health care?

Seriously. This is BANANAS. 

You couldn't get ALL 50 state Medicaid directors to agree any anything else in health care policy. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/911036343664484352 …

The cruelty of #GrahamCassidy is almost too much to comprehend. https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/909920752157253634 …

TAKE ACTION: No votes on #GrahamCassidy from @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins could save health care for hundreds of thousands of vets! 

My ACA Cancer experience #Indivisible #TheResistance #UniteBlue #DemForce @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @JoyAnnReid @benwikler @ABC @MSNBC @CNN 

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 

Hello, @LindseyGrahamSC and @BillCassidy. Look long and hard at these pictures. This is my friend Jake. Without ACA he will die. 
So very disappointed in the Graham Cassidy bill. Vote NO
You've been busy supporting a bad bill so let me share this with you.
#GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
You are truly the photo op king. Would've  been nice to have held a town hall prior to the vote on that horrid bill of which you are a part.
On a slight break from healthcare - GOP plans to give themselves & Trump a huge tax cut
Guess which well-known company is a pass-through? 
That's right, the Trump Organization. 
The GOP wants to give Donald Trump a huge tax cut. https://twitter.com/LPDonovan/status/911726707371118593 …
Can we call you former Senator Heller yet?
Did you ask them for their papers? Did you tell them you are taking their healthcare away? Start looking at the want ads.
Did they have a great time with the person taking away their health care?
You can't suck up hard enough Dean ... health care or "paper or plastic", sir.
No on Cassidy-Graham or talk about dinner stab people in the back Heller.
Will #DeanHeller hold a town hall to tell us about why his "healthcare" bill is good for NV? My guess is no since the bill is bad & he hides
He holds them over the phone. I live with a republican  so I get calls but alas they he never me
I know he only does tele-town halls . Wanted to point out that he hides from us & can't sell his plan because it's so bad
Yet you want to sell out healthcare for Latinos and Latinas
Please vote no
What I meant to say, was to take your name off of the bill.  Arriba #HispanicHeritageMonth
Kill your bill not me
get a room !
Do you have any idea how many Latino children you want to hurt with ur despicable HC bill. We care for them and we know. This is hypocrisy!
You look like you had one yo many. Get off the Dreamer Act and give yo our own citizens.
You suck
Then why are supporting a healthcare bill that will literally kill Hispanic people?
Funny that "don't boo", allegedly a cosponsor of the healthcare travesty, isn't trusted by other senators to appear anywhere in support...
Did you explain to them about removing their healthcare? All those big smiles might go away. Failed senator.
You're supporting a Russian elected MORON. Have your idiot fake president explain your fucking bill. Sorry, what was that? He can't? FU
Sen Heller? DJT owned, basement bargain price? Millions of Nevadans lose hc cov to give richest Amers tax cuts. Old boys club over constits?
You are bought and paid for by Adelson, Kochs, Mercers, and more. Republicans are DONE. You've awoken a GIANT, and we will never give up.
You think stealing our healthcare instead of fixing it for everyone is going to go unnoticed? You haven't seen resistance yet. #SaveTheACA
Was Mathew Perry not available for the sequel?
Graham-Cassidy is an obvious tax cut/payoff for your wealthy donors at the expense of the American people. My ACA works! Fix it for others!!
Don't you get it.  He's pacing the way for his next job.  He's not planning for NVs future, he's planning for his own.
Had a great time at the dinner last night, knowing over 90% of the people in attendance would suffer from my support of #GrahamCassidy
Did you tell them you’re taking away their healthcare?
My ACA premiums are fair and my plan works beautifully. Do the work to make everyone's ACA work like mine, instead of trying to kill us all.
don't take healthcare from millions
Please say no #GrahamCassidyBill
No one likes you. #2018
Do they know that they may lose their health coverage?
After we oust you next year, you'll have plenty of free time for dinners on the town! #DumpDeanIn18
