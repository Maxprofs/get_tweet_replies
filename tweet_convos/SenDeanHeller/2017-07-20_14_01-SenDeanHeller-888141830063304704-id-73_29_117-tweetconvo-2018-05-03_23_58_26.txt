While you advance nowhere on opposing Trumpcare. We'll not forget your betrayal & morally bankrupt silence as the quiet witness to the bully
I really think he is trying to what is best for us. I hope he does not let trump bully him into anything.

RT: @SenDeanHeller #RepealAndRun is not up for debate. #KillTheBill & #ProtectOurCare! 

Bipartisan governors write to @SenateMajLdr & @SenSchumer urging the Senate to reject "skinny" repeal bill.  
GOP was bribed/threatened. Heller #Nevada was a no until billionaire Steve Wynn called him every day
Trump threatens
Vote no on repeal. No on GOP replacements & work bipartisan to improve ACA. Be on right side of history.
There's no bipartisan improvement of ACA. Dems want single payer like British NHS which decided instead of parents about Charlie Gard
Heller voted to repeal in the past he needs to do it and then work on the new plan
Your LV staffer is currently refusing to call you, but your office on Sunset is filled with activists demanding you protect their care
Do you.... not have a phone?
These are people who will die if you vote Yes on the BCRA, OBRA, or Medicaid budget reduction. Why can't they get a phone call?
They will not die. Most are people mooching off the hard working contributing members of our society. All they want is free Medicaid.
Most people pay for their health care and don't take government money.
So your statement is an Un-Educated pile of Horse Manure
Hey Nate, sorry that you're not informed. We're at Ikea now actually if you want to come hear the stories of the people protesting today
If you don't get reelected it will be because your obstructionist stand to @POTUS agenda
We'll get someone for your Primary who will work with @POTUS and will get RNC and his support. You'll go down for crossing @POTUS
Thank you for you efforts on behalf of Nevada protecting us from nuclear waste.
Why bother since you're just saving us so that cancer or other illnesses can kill us if we cannot access or afford care because of Trumpcare
Nevada need Yucca Mountain.  Jobs!!!
Nothing the senate GOP does is positive, you make me sick. #GOPsenatemustgo
Good. Now you have time to write your statement on why repealing ACA is bad for Nevada and your commitment to a bipartisan effort to fix it.
You are from Mexifornia aren't you?
Trump threatened him and he caved! He thinks his vote today will save his job, it won't! He don't care about the us who put him in office.

Heller was a no until billionaire casino magnate Steve Wynn threatened him almost daily. What a sad, perfect example of money in politics.
Please dont let that become leverage in the health care debate or NV will always be vulnerable.
Senators are in Congress to help people! Please think of the poor, sick & disabled & vote NO to MTP. The US people need you!!!!
You have to be kidding!  This is absurd. Don't vote on something to get a "win."  If you come home with a yes on this garbage, best wishes!
nice but the nation needs to keep ACA. Do not repeal only. Please work with Dems to improve ACA. thanks
That's great! Let's hold off until they offer us we a really fantastic deal that would be hard to refuse!

@SenDeanHeller let's talk TURKEY or chicken if you prefer. If you vote 2 eliminate HEALTH CARE or #ACA i may have 2move2 Nev 2 unseat you.
Respectfully vote no on you know what. Thank you

Capito, Heller, & others used to invoke needing to wait for a CBO score to justify wavering. Now going along with lack of a score—OR a bill. https://twitter.com/sangerkatz/status/889585434627645440 …
Please stay strong. 32mil, 23mil or 22mil losing health care. Which is one is OK WITH YOU? Please vote NO to moving forward
Hey Dean. If you let us down and vote for #Trumpcare no one will care. That'd hurt way more people than Yucca could.
2018 ~ Coming Soon!

3- Let's look at Nevada. @DeanHeller. Can someone who makes $13,000 in your state afford to spend >1/2 their income on care?…

RINO Alert: These 5 Senate Millionaires are 
blocking #Obamacare Repeal
Time to man the phones #Trumpers #Healthcare #ACA 
Senator, would you back turning Yucca into a reprocessing center? Only waste with high reclaim potential would be handled & many jobs create

 
I want health, not Healthcare.  
Please vote to Repeal Obamacare 
Medicaid & Medicare can cover the poor until it's replaced.
Yucca is on a major earthquake fault. Use it for data storage.
Good. I hope this didn't happen because of some back room deal giving your vote to healthcare bill
Rumors are flying . . .
Keep sucking up to your liberal base... oh wait, your base isn't liberal.
On healthcare, please listen to your heart. Listen to the people you represent. Brush off Trump's threatening you. You will be re-elected.
Vote to repeal is a vote to retire
Great. What about the possible Constitutional Crisis coming up?
We're dying out here ,my wife's health ins premium $1,000 per M. I can't afford H.I for myself now. You made a pledge!
no on trumpcare
Vote NO on repealing or replacing ACA.
He'll be out of a job in need of healthcare if he doesn't stand up for Nevadans against these horrible plans coming from the GOP
You're very quiet on repeal. Where do you stand? Don't abandon Nevada. Vote NO on repeal.
Not enough to get you off the hook for supporting a disastrous healthcare bill.   Shame on you!   VOTE NO to repeal!!!!
Please,quit changing the subject. How do you stand on the HC bill? We have a right to know if you are going to throw Nevadans under the bus.
Great news for #LasVegas! 

Thx Dean. Can't vote for ya unless you change to independent. Dump the Repubs  vote blue
Did you really say, "It depends on the individual."? What the hell kind of response is that? Deep down, you are just like the rest of them.
Let's take a positive step towards a better GOP
Well dean session stoud up to trump are you a coward show the voter they put u in an they can put u out
Dean Heller needs to remember that it won't be the democrats who vote to either keep him or throw him out of the senate. Will be republicans
Yes, like this registered Repub who is deeply disappointed in the GOP & will definitely be helping vote out those who aren't for the ppl.
Heller you are a patriot that sat next to Satan and was able to laugh God Bless you keep your citizens safe! Thank you America

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage."
