This approach to "talking with constituents" is just one of the reasons we've created The Committee To Unseat Dean Heller.  Buh bye!
Where do we sign up to help? It is my mission to see he never represents NV again.
So far we're only in Reno. Are you up here?
No, Clark County. Can we start one here?
Absolutely!
Smart move when the left (Move http://on.org ) is paying agitators $150 to "flood town halls" to protest. A paid mob.
Krissy, that's called "organizing." It's what all parties and politicians do. Are you really that ignorant?
GOP doesn't pay "Organizers" to "flood town halls with Protestors". That's a paid Mob ASKA "The Resistance". 
I wish someone would pay me for all the organizing I'm doing. Just the grass roots, taking hold
These are a fraud. All prescreened and wrapped in baby wipes so you can keep your ass clean of the issues that matter to Nevadans.
A "town hall" that only had the selected few. Most of us knew nothing about it.  Why r u scared of us?
Because he is a liar and a coward. Very simple. #HellerNo2018
Once again, how does one of your constituents find out about you "town hall" meeting (s)????
How can we at least be informed on when you're hosting the tele-townhalls? I'd prefer a real one... You did one up North, what about South?
Missed it what's your position on budget proposal? Planned parenthood? Healthcare? Citizens united? Controlling drug costs? We don't know??
Where was my invite? The transcripts? Recordings?

Our senator can't bring himself to the largest city in Nevada. Shame!!
HI REMEMBER US IN WASHOE COUNTY?? DID YOU TELL ANYONE NOT A SUPPORTERS IN CLARK ABOUT THIS ?? You picked to back the worst prez in history
Did you again use tax payer money to only invite friendly folks whose softball questions you screened anyway? #SenCraven
Are you man enough to give up your subsized 72% healthcare and buy individual plan in NV like I have to do?Good enuf for me you should too??
This format of Town Hall clearly points out your unwillingness to meet your constituents face-to-face. What are you afraid of? #NoIn2018
Looking forward 2 "doing more" ??!!  You've been doing nothing 4 Nevadans 4 far too long #toolittletoolate #nicetrydean
he took away Internet privacy and continued to make nv a technological backwater
That's not a town hall. That's a conference call. Have a spine and face the people you are taking healthcare away from.
I emailed your office two weeks ago. Still no response. Also, no response regarding @GregForMontana 
2018 shall be interesting.
Exactly WTH is a telephone town hall? Is it where we can call in and are there reporters there? Please reply so I can take part in next one.
Don't bother, they screen the callers, and if someone asks a serious question, he refers them to his office.
#duplicitousdean.  He thinks we are fools.
Heller just don't care. Only thing he cares about is re-election. Period. The best thing to do is keep hammering on him.
Where can we review the audio, Sir? I have asked already once, please, tell us where to download it. Do we need to make a formal request?
Good for you- telephone town halls are hard. Now try one in person, where everyone gets to go in this time - no heller 2018
#duplicitousdean. These are fake town halls for #nevadans. By invitation only, with no follow up. We see you.Come see us in in a #TownHall
Yea, good "atta boy"...NOT! Call-in townhall, what a joke. Y don't u face all Clark cnty & not private luncheon or via phone. #hellerout2018
How much did a person have to donate to be included? I heard nothing of it, until your tweet.
Did you call anyone that's not a donor???
When politicians "phone it in", its time for them to step aside for someone to represent constituents. Time for #DeanExit
Health Care, not Wealth care!
You need to start thinking of your constituents if you want reelection. Hiding won't do it!
I sat by your staffers at the Reno TH- they had an us v them tude.  I can only assume that came from you.
Your ppl talked about us like we weren't  there, rolled their eyes at our questions and when I asked them not 2b nasty replied w/ Hillary
I happen to know they wanted to see u in person.
Retweet if you want @SenDeanHeller to do town hall exp his stand on AHCA, budget, @realDonaldTrump obstruction, impeachment!
Why didn't you let your constituents know ahead of time about this?  Many of us didn't know until after the fact.
Aide personally called me months ago and said I would be on Clark Cty call. Never got invited. Is it because I am critical of ur positions?

Too hot to meet people in person?

Tick, tock.
Please protect health care. Americans are counting on you! House bill is cruel and immoral!
When will the audio be uploaded?
Senator- stop pandering to the far left who organize these ambush "town halls". Pay attention to the people who will actually vote for you!
Maybe you should do it in person.
You are a disappointment and an embarrassment to your constituents. Stand up for what's right. Country over party. #Vote2018
Thanks for the 1-hour notice of the call. What a cowardly way to hold a meeting. #Vote2018 #Bye
Why won't you actually face us? Why weren't all of us alerted to your "town hall"? The democrats have more balls than you.
Senator Heller, your hard work and dedication to the great state of Nevada is very much appreciated! Thank you!!
With all due respect it wasn't a town hall it was a Q&A. You offered no ability to comment or ask follow up questions. You can do better.
So weak. Your staff said they choose who to call from voter lists? Like one that say how we registered?
With all the verbal abuse you get on twitter alone, no wonder u hold town halls by telephone. Keep up the good work @SenDeanHeller God Bless
Emailed your LV staff on Feb 23 w/ specific questions re: How invites for tele-town halls are decided/announced. No response. #HellerNo2018
LOL you're a joke of a senator. Cowards cannot face their constituents.
"Telephone town hall"? COWARD!

@SenDeanHeller can you please be a leader like @tedlieu and @RepAdamSchiff they acknowledge this administration is chaos. Do the same, FFS.
When will your next town hall be in Reno?
Was that call only for your republican friends?  Vote him out 2017
Telephone town hall = Fake town hall. He proudly hides. If Heller walks like a chicken and talks like a chicken, then assume he is a chicken
WHY ARE THESE A SECRET? You don't announce when they're happening, you get a random call, no idea how to ask a question. Why hide?
He hand picks and you can't sign up! I've asked many times but he lies and says he wants to reach out , then limits the number
We want you to face us in person !!!!!
"Telephone town hall"? COWARD!

Do not kill Obamacare.  The GOP AHCA is dangerous.
Telephone? Something wrong with you? No? Then get your cowardly behind to Vegas and talk to the people who pay your salary!
Why aren't these posted on Facebook or Twitter?  I've emailed, phoned, tweeted and posted... how am I not included?  Open invites needed.
I didn't get an invite. I live in Vegas. Do you represent all of Nevada or just YOUR chosen few? 
Not only can you not do these in person but you don't even respect us enough to respond to any of these replies.
"Telephone town hall"? COWARD!

your kidding. I would like a public and live town hall. There are some things I would like to say.
VOTE NO on AHCA.
Hmmm. I didn't receive my invite Senator whom I voted for.. 
What a back door attempt to be a senator. Shows your true yellow colors.

Running out the clock only works when you're ahead. Hiding from your angry constituents isn't going to win you any elections.
I received no info on this so-called town hall. PLEAE REPLY with how i can sign up for the next one. Yes i am a Dem. Are we allowed??
How do you get selected to participate? I've contacted your offices repeatedly???
You are a chicken. Your last term. #medicare4all
I have stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Obamacare is keeping me alive & can cure me. What's your plan so I don't die next year?

I would have liked to have been included.  Please give advanced notice.

You need to give advance warning so we can tell you our how we feel! Just when we start to think you're human...you do a stealth townhall.
