.@SenatorCollins: GOP health care bill "could lead to insurance plans that really are barely insurance at all." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Do your Job!  We want our healthcare, ACA!
@DeanHeller 
Not coming out against #Trumpcare IS AS BAD as supporting it. 

NV WILL remember in 2018.

#HealthcareBill
please reject #GOPCare.  removing money from healthcare does not create better care.  #publicOPtion or #singlePayer would improve #ACA.
Don't be bought or threatened. Vote your conscience. #hellervoteno
Do not give in to political pressure & condone this unworkable, insane bill.  No job is worth it.  They will destroy you one way or another.

Have you ever read any of your messages?  We want the ACA! Do your job, and keep the ACA!  And read your messages from us all!
If Obamacare is good enough for U.S. Senators, let us have it, too.
@SenDeanHellerSenate delays vote 2 take away health care of American tax payers so JMcCain may heal frm surgery paid 4 by American taxpayers

Not a "health" care bill and everyone knows this. 17% percent of Americans approve appeal ACA.
Please stay strong, unswayed and unpaid by McConnell and vote NO on this atrocious legislation.  #Trumpcarekills
Insurance CEOs, in rare joint letter, tell lying @SenateMajLdr:  #BCRA would be a disaster for America. Call Heller
BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage."

He survived. But can they?

#HellerVoteNo
Don't sell your vote to Mike Pence - tantamount to selling your soul to the Devil
Please vote no on health care bill. Ran a ob/gyn practice in Reno for 5 years. The AHCA saved lives with available cancer screenings.
Notice not 1 comment cares about anything else. Vote no (and announce it NOW, so we can breath and McConnell can move on) or many will die
You, and you alone, can stop massive suffering and death. IF you don't, this will be the vote you legacy is built on. KILL THIS BILL

Please share, especially if you live in Nevada: 
Please vote for the new Health care. Obama care has been a complete disaster.
Please say no to the disaster of Trumpcare 3. It's a horror story!!!
How can you still be undecided about the health care vote?  Nothing in it has changed enough for you to abandon your previous concerns.
If you are concerned bout the welfare of Nevadans, you must vote "No" on this healthcare bill.
2018 is round the corner vote no on Trumpcareless
Heller Vote No on the healthcare bill.It's disgusting that healthcare will be taken away from families for a tax cut.USA is better than this
They do it in spite of your poor "leadership."
Everyone hates you. Go away.
Better stick to the no vote on this Anti-healthcare bill, or I believe you assuredly will be unseated in 2018. Sound advice to follow...
I'm w/ u Dean. Many constituents also face grave danger of a terrible healthcare bill passing w/ zero bipartisan support. Be brave. Vote No.
Vote no on TrumpCare! Do what is right!
You must VOTE NO on Trumpcare or risk killing many elderly and poor
Majority (60%) of Nevadans hate BCRA. If you vote No, U may get the stink eye from the radical Right. But if U vote YES, your career is over
How does the new Trumpcare bill help Nevadans? It doesn't! Stand up and VOTE NO. Stand for your people.
Please Repeal Obamacare. It is crooked and filed false documents to the IRS. Took over a year to correct their fraudulent documents.

‘There is no plan B’ - this woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time 
Don't vote for the bill Senator, please! Make the right call, step up and be a leader.
I hear you've already been bought off. Will be donating bigly bucks to your opponent, @RepJackyRosen . Get ready for unemployment!
So, if Weathcare is such an Awesome plan we should force Congress to have it!
Nothing they can give you should be worth your soul or integrity. Vote  no
Average Americans do not have the cake that the wealthy white guys that keep drafting this crap seem to think they do! #SaveACA
Counting on you being a hero, not a zero!  The people of the United States will laud you as a hero for courage! #SaveACA
