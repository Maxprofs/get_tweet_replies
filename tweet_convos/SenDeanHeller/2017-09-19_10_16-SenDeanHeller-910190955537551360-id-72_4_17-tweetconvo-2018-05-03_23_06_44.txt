So happy for deserving Henderson and embarrassed that our Senator touts "triumph of Federalism" about healthcare, but flips when convenient.
...There are vets, seniors, disabled, etc. who will lose coverage under Graham-Cassidy. Please put country over party..
Shame on you Dean for not also standing up for healthcare . #VoteNOGrahamCassidy 
Do the right thing for people
He's a co-sponsee, was hiding it from us!
It's not enough to pay for the healthcare you are taking away from them. #HellerLies
ICYMY: @SenDeanHeller has a plan to to attack low income citizens. Dean's working to destroy healthcare security for millions of Americans.
Do the right thing and vote NO to #GrahamCassidyBill
#DeanHeller is a YES as he is CO-SPONSORING this bill. It's too late. He betrayed his constituents.
Tell it Rana! I only found out today, and so not happy
I wish more people knew. This bill is almost as bad, if not worse, than BCRA, which #DeanHeller voted against. He's betrayed Nevadans
Yes he has, and hid it!
To be fair, I keep up with the news (esp since I rely on ACA) & knew he co-sponsored this weeks ago. Details about how bad it is are new tho
Well Rana, I followed you so hopefully I will know a little sooner from now on, thanks!
That's great Mr Heller. What are doing to help the middle class. Wait, I'll tell you, Nothing!!!!! Your out!
How about Healthcare? Please continue to fight to save Medicaid for millions of disabled Americans and pre existing conditions!
W.o. #Medicaid ER's will be overloaded and ppl dying in the streets
#Medicare4All #SinglePayer #ACA
This damn well better help THE PEOPLE...not like the $$M sent to help coal miners...that DIDN'T!!
You know what else helps low-income families? ACA subsidies and marketplaces which allow them afford & purchase healthcare #NoRepeal #ACA
Oh great.  They will have a warm place to be sick in now, but at least Heller will get the big bucks for his election run now.  Good boy
Right?
SenHeller,both homeless and low income citizens will be amount the hardest hit by your support of the GrahamCassidyInsBill: and you know it

HENDERSON? GO TO OGDEN AND LAS VEGAS BULEVARD, YOU SEE HUNDREDS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. ARE YOU SURE YOU DONT HAVE INVESTMENTS IN HENDERSON?
Low income families need high quality affordable healthcare. #GrahamCasiddy is avdangerous sham of a bill.
What happened to getting Governor to sign off? @GovSandoval rejects ur plan to strip healthcare in NV
Good- when you take away healthcare for families on the edge we will have more homeless working Nevadans.
Meanwhile he tries to convince Nevadans they don't need healthcare. #VoteHellerOut #SaveOurCare
I noticed you signed on to the Graham-Cassidy death bill... Nicely done Dean! Your mission to become a horrendous human being is complete!

So the trade-off is health coverage for the majority of the citizens of Nevada?
Stop the GOP Repeal and Replace!!! Medicaid for all who don't have employer healthcare!!!!
...Graham Cassidy is worse than the ACA. This bill is terrible and will cause millions of people to lose healthcare.
please don't be afraid of Trump and continue to follow your heart and mind,vote no on this new awful bill
This awful amendment that @SenDeanHeller co-authored is his pride and joy. Don't expect him to whip out his moral compass.
Vote no on the current healthcare bill! Vote for what's good for the country not the party. Don't be a wimp! Vote your convictions!!
You do some good things. None of which matter because of your horrendous health care bill
But you're still taking their healthcare.  You are a monster!
But you'll let them die???  #DoYourJob  Protect our children, our veterans, our elderly, our sick, our poor. NO ONE wants this bill.
Heller: "But we won't need any of that housing once I kill them all off by yanking their medical care."
WE WILL FIGHT YOU ON HEALTHCARE. YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. WE WILL NOT FORGET YOUR HYPOCRISY.
Apparently U Don't Care abt People just& TAX CUTS FOR WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS!
HOW U CAN HURT AMERICANS IS BEYOND REASON!
ALL AMERICANS WILL SUFFER FROM #GrahamCassidy!
CUTS HURT DISABLED ILL& WORKING POOR! ESP DISABLED
LIKE MIKE! VOTE NO!
Struggling families need access to healthcare. Sen. Heller is trying to steal that away. Say NO to #GrahamCassidy.
WATCH & SHARE: @DavidCertner calls #GrahamCassidy a "last-ditch effort to ram a bad bill, developed behind closed doors, through Congress." 
How bout Trumpcare 2 where you take healthcare away?
you have a responsibility to Nevada!!! what's wrong with you man? what do the have on you 5.5 million? your finished so vote however!
Once illegal immigrants are deported, I'm sure this will be a great hand up for homeless American citizens.
Do the right thing and vote NO to #GrahamCassidyBill
Oh, they won't need homes after your healthcare bill kills them off.
#DeanHeller led out his constituents for $$$ from mega-donors. This isn't how democracy works. Shame on all Reps
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Did you know your staff doesn't even know if there's going to be a CBO score? They took my #, but never called back. Nice -
You think you won't pay for co-sponsoring this graham-Cassidy bill. Trust me you will be unemployable after this.
How about some healthcare to go with  the housing!!  VOTE NP ON DEATHCARE
You'll be joining them after co-sponsoring that graham-Cassidy bill.
And the staggering hypocrisy of #DeanHeller who is co-sponsoring bill to gut Medicaid & weaken pre-ex cond coverage
The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16330094/cassidy-graham-hypocrisy?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter …
http://bit.ly/2ynUxth  @GovSandoval is fed up with Heller taking healthcare away from NV residents. Heller lied on June 23- #nointegrity
@GOP @SenateGOP Shame-hands off our healthcare! Lying greedy corrupt dark $$$-complicit treason, inciting violence #SaveACA #nullify2016
Vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill. #GrahamCassidy #Nevada #2018iscoming
ICYMI Our own @GovSandoval signed a letter with other State Governor's AGAINST your shame #TrumpCare #GOPCare bill #AskDean #HellerFail
Takes low income peoples healthcare however if u do survive an illness he will give u a place to stay for a few months while file bankruptcy
Repubs resort to lying and breaking Senate norms for this sham of a "healthcare" bill that harms people. r u proud?
This is a must read from @JRubinBlogger on what's happening with repeal. Notice the tactics.

So to get a vote on your sham of a "healthcare" bill, NV children could get hurt. Shame on you
West Virginia, Arizona and Nevada may freeze enrollment in CHIP in the coming weeks if Congress fails to act. https://twitter.com/dylanlscott/status/910205737242112001 …
This is just heartless. #DeanHeller is ok with hurting our most innocent & needy. Shame on him
The new GOP health care repeal means premature infants could hit the lifetime cap before even leaving the hospital: http://bit.ly/2f5SotS 
THIS is what Republicans are doing to everyday hard-working people who happen to be sick. Shame on all of you
I've had metastatic cancer. Last night I was sobbing just watching my kids do their homework, grateful to be here for it. This is heartless. https://twitter.com/AGSchneiderman/status/909859641873575937 …
Again with this. U r co-sponsoring a "healthcare" bill that cuts hundreds of millions of $ but tout a $5.5M grant
NEW: Bipartisan group of governors—including of AK, LA, NV, and PA—release statement opposing Graham-Cassidy. 
That's great! Now take care of all #Nevadans and vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill
No on #GrahamCassidyBill  it's bad for Nevada and we know it. If you vote yes on this that means you're bad for Nevadans too and out in 2018
Bet the Republicans tax cut bill will give bigger financial breaks to the wealthy than THESE federal grants to help the poor combined.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Sandoval comes out against travesty cosponsored by @SenDeanHeller , a mediocrity intent on making his last act taking Medicaid from Nevadans
Vote no on #Trumpcare asshat!
I thought Repubs didn't like spending $ on social progs that help the poor.
Your on a roll w/ helping ppl, so stop backing #GrahamCassidy
NO we didn't miss it -but what we are missing is decent healthcare legislation instead of this sham policy you sponsored undermining #Nevada
This is great, but what about healthcare funding?  #GrahamCassidy would decimate #Medicaid, hurting Nevadans and veterans, who you support
