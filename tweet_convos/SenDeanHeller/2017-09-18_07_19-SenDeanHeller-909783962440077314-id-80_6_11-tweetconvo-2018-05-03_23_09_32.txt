Why, why, why do you hate Americans so much? Why do you want to take away our healthcare? Please reconsider!
Good job. US govt already owns most of NV. Protection good but this was too big designation area. Land is for people to use and care for.

It's only "overreach" when Obama did it & "states rights" when GOP does it. You want nothing but to destroy everything w/ Obama's name on it
Shame on you for signing on to this horrible Graham-Cassidy bill that will hurt NV just b/c you're desperate for an anti-Obama "win". SHAME!
You are so useless. Stop trying to take away healthcare for millions of Americans (including me), fight for our monuments!! Do your job.
U R Going To Be VOTED OUT!!!!!!!!
You will doom more than just your constituents if you pass #trumpcare - we are all in this together. VOTE NO
If you vote for this ridiculous attempt  to do something about health care , I will spend as much of my time as possible to get you removed
Dean, you will NEVER get re-elected. Say Good bye to POLITICS. You just KILLED these precious kids. Vote NO
This is a  "red siren"  moment for the entire country and we are here to sound the alarm. Help us! 202-224-3121 
So glad you're going to lose your seat.
#DeanHeller stood with @GovSandoval & promised to protect Medicaid & pre-ex cond coverage. He LIED. His "healthcare" bill is bad for NV.

Laura has stage 4 cancer-she spoke out against the bill then Trump blocked her–Please retweet her video reply below. 
Thank you.
I disagree with you.  Leave the monument alone.
NO ON REPEAL REPLACE OCARE..or are you just a TOOOOL of Trump?
Heard you are sponsoring the bill with L Graham. U really dont want to be Senator anymore do you? UHC or CIGNA offer you a job or something?
Why? Nobody cares what you think.
Dean, you will forever crucify your political career by taking away hcare from millions! Hilary, O'bama tried. . . and failed. YOU WILL TOO
Why are you supported the Cassidy bill? 32 million would lose coverage, preexisting conditions wouldn't be protected and many would suffer!
Why no stmt yet on healthcare bill you are trying to pass w/o a CBO score? Can you please include answers to these ?

Please vote against the latest iteration of Trumpcare. Protect and fix the ACA, for the sake of your constituents and for all Americans.
Thanks for your support of local communities in Assembly District 19. This is a good recommendation for all NV.
Reduction af protection to public lands just can't be good. This is about interests of rich people again, water rights.
Wise up, Stand up with our President Trump
Heller is bad for Nevada!  Vote him out 2018
You are proud of that?????  Shameful!
Shut up RINO
Dean, I am seriously worried about your knees & jaw....they have got to hurt like hell by now.
Keep doing what we elected a GOP to do, REDUCE GOVERNMENT! This was a step in the right direction...STOP YUCCA & GET RID OF OBAMACARE
Heller is lying- @GovSandoval rejects this travesty for Block Grants. Anti-Nevada #nointegrity

Under latest Repub 'healthcare' bill if you had an UNCOMPLICATED pregnancy in the past, your premium will go up 425%

Get on another subject Deano. This is a cover for healthcare. First things first. When you vote for Cassidy/Graham we WILL REMEMBER
I can only hope
The Republican party Heller if this horrific death bill pass see u Republican kill people with a swip of a pen pro life ur party is no more
Don't you understand we don't care what you have to say. You're trying to sell us down the river again with this new healthcare bill.
Reagan: "There is no limit to what a man can do...if he does not mind who gets the credit.” Heller: "Look at me, me, me, me, me, me, me!"
NO MATTER HOW MUCH HELLER DOES NOW, ITS STILL TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.    GO DANNY TARKANIAN!!!!
@RosenforNevada has my full support. No more GOP, only in it for themselves. Lying is their way.
Heller is a spineless asshole.

Even Forbes knows Heller is a lying sellout. https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2017/09/18/graham-cassidy-bill-the-last-ditch-gop-effort-to-deprive-millions-of-healthcare/#2c5a08d93b92 …
Lord, this is terribly written English! First sentence has incorrect structure + all the "I, me, mine" attempts to puff up yourself. #joke
It's sickening to see a US Senator brag about how strong of a "states' rights" proponent he is. Not even a dog whistle to racists.
Please don't sign the terrible health care bill. 6 month old niece  tested positive for cystic fibrosis. Income is small family business.
You are one of the henchmen co-sponsoring the Graham Cassidy Health Care repeal bill. It will cost you in 2018.
I used to be an independent voter in NV & have voted 4 both parties. Never again after R's going after my healthcare. Vote @RosenforNevada
Unless your bank account has 8 figures, there is zero reason to vote R.
Save our health care for! Dear god I hate the GOP!
What part of national monument don't u get? 4all peopl not just NV preserve our land #nosenate4uin18
Shame, shame, shame! Pres. did not overreach, do you know history? Again, shame!
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
Again, you lie. There is more support for retaining the monuments in full than reduction of them. You also promised to protect Medicaid.
You tout states rights but limit what states can do on h-care by cutting fed $ & ending $ in 2026. Liar & traitor
Your sham of a "healthcare" bill makes it tougher 4 states to provide healthcare given gutting of fed $. Liar https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/909777054119481344 …
Don't use tax money to pay for a great rock formation and then charge people to see the rock formation    Come on.
Read the #voters of #Nv request for you to #resign from office #Trump #puppet #Nevada #LasVegas #Reno #Elko
#DeanHeller's "healthcare" bill does everything he promised not to do - cuts fed $ to states & Medicaid &  prems
JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
You lied to us re healthcare. Your "sham" of a bill will gut $ to states & weaken pre-ex cov guarantee. Shame on u
