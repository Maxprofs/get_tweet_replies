I'm still looking for you and your colleagues to do the right thing on real gun control
How much money has the NRA paid you Heller?
Over $21K
Whoo
@NRA and Heller are what's wrong with this country! Blood on ur hands
So it takes either a fundraiser or the biggest mass shooting in US history to get you to come to Southern Nevada?  Disgraceful.
You're not the news. You're a politician, so how are you going to use your political power to protect your constituents from firearms?
Your giving blood doesn't make us forget- WE SEE YOU. We know who you are.

Nevada Senator Dean Heller voted against limits on magazine size, assault weapons, background checks https://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/10/2/1703332/-Nevada-Senator-Dean-Heller-voted-against-limits-on-magazine-size-assault-weapons-background-checks …
Why don't you assist and vote for gun control.  And yes, this is the time and place to talk about this.  I know u prefer this talk goes away

You voted against expanding background checks for anyone trying to purchase a firearm at a gun show or online. 59 lost lives are on YOU! 
Yep, you're part of the gun problem.
For a photo opp?
Proud of yor NRA record Dean?
You know what would really help? If you passed some gun control
So can we talk about common sense gun control now???
As a responsible gun owner in your district, who voted for you: I don't understand how more than 10 guns for 1 single person is okay?
If you were wondering why you lost a loved one you can look right at Senator Heller. He is an accessory and partly responsible for this.
If you’re looking for a Senator who stands up to the NRA and protects innocent people, look elsewhere.
How much $ has NRA & gun manufacturers given you to vote against sensible gun legislation.
Eeewww young turks
Nevada Senator @SenDeanHeller voted against limits on magazine size, assault weapons, background checks
You have blood on your hands
Dean Heller voted against Sensible Gun Control Law.
Money accepted from gun industry at time of voting: $42,247 
Blood money bribe for lives
@realDonaldTrump Here's what we are looking for Dean: strict gun control laws to prevent more massacres
We take off our shoes at airports but continue allowing anyone to buy automatic weapons?
Whatcha gonna do with the 21K the NRA has donated to you, Dean?
Well aren't you just Mr. Helpful Dean...Did u throw up a lil Thoughts & Prayer actuon today too?
Yiu dont give a shit
You are you at the Wynn All You Can Eat Buffett? Has he stepped up - your #1 contributor. His blood hasn't been donated, or yours!
Thank you for passing along the information from the Red Cross.
If slaughtered children didn't get u to vote Yes on Manchin-Toomey I am afraid massacred concert goers may not convince you change is needed
They’re on to you, Senator.

Should be open all the time for victims of our gun orgy.
Satisfied?
Guns/healthcare. It may be best if you stop tweeting. You have lost all respect. Too little too late. Your words ring hollow.
May the faces of the dead and injured haunt your waking and sleeping hours. You enabled this mass massacre. When will you grow some Balls?
Now look at the faces of families who lost loved ones and those whose family members are shot and injured. Keep your pathetic sympathy..
Take a moment to reflect on your vote against limits on magazine size, assault weapons and background checks.
Looking for politicians who put their constituents ahead of special interest $$$. Guess that doesn't include you, Dean
DON'T PRETEND YOU GIVE A SHIT
Thanks for the advice Dean, however, this would not have happened without politicians like you who walk in lockstep with gun freaks. VOTEHELLEROUT2018 /FUCK THE NRA, /they kill our kids for $$$$$$$$
Dean-do not pretend that you are helpful- you+your GOP colleagues consistently FAIL TO DO THE RIGHT THING-GROW A CONSCIENCE- AND SOME BALLS!

If your looking for a Senator who is not owned by corporations, nut jobs & the MRA vote Heller out of office. He is a silent killer
.voted against limits on magazine size, assault weapons, background checks loves NEA $$$ more than peopl #noseat4uin18
In addition to tweeting how to give blood, give back NRA money and vote against the gun silencer bill. #SendBackTheMoney
The NRA got their $$'s worth in that statement. The world is a dangerous place, and YOU are the danger! Dean Heller and the @GOP, bought and paid for by the NRA!
How much did you take from the NRA for your votes?
What are you going to do about reasonable controls on automatic weapons? If nothing, then i will support your opponent.
You're right 10/1/17 will b remembered as another day when innocent lives were lost bc members of congress think #Gun Control is partisan
gofundme is not health insurance Obamacare is...
Maybe if you & your GOP Compadres hadn’t voted against gun control this wouldn’t have happened.
Are you going to vote to legalize silencers?
You've got some nerve showing your face during this time... all of those young people, if you get your way, won't have health insurance...
You are a killer!
You are evil
Gun control you fool!!  Stop supporting NRA. 
@WomensMarchLV @RalstonReports
you’re losing re election
Great you are helping loved ones of deceased. How about preventing these events from occurring? #SensibleGunLaws #NRACreatesCowards
