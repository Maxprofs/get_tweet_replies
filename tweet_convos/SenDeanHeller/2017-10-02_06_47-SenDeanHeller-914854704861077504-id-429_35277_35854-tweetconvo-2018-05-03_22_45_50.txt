Listen to words, not dialect
Fred Hampton in Court pointing out that the DA was working against him, this was before the FBI assassinated him
The FBI claiming they won't ever do things like this again
After Assassinating Fred Hampton, the FBI coveted it up and it took 20 years on court to reveal their lies

Love, peace and unity Las Vegas. We feel your pain at this tragic time.
The best way to help would be for YOU and the rest of the @GOP to enact gun laws to prevent FUTURE attacks! This did not have to happen!

This info might need to be updated. Please keep it updated so we can give the correct info.
This was such a tragic thing..prayers to the families
Lamentable lo sucedido en las Vegas y mis condolencias alas Familias de los Ya Fallecidos
The majority of Americans want sensible gun laws but you sold us out  for  a $7,450 donation from the @NRA. Orlando, Vegas and the next mass  shooting are on you. We see your hypocrisy.
Yes Las Vegas Are In My Family Prayers  Definitely!!
Prayers for all
I'm praying for city of Las Vegas. God help them. This is very bad news for everyone. I'm very sorry that happen. Be strong and peaceful.

The Senseless Killing Of Innocent People, Is so Senseless, Because It Causes A Lot Of Pain, Hurt, And, Sadness For Family Members!Me in NZ
Wow
Your comments are a little tone deaf. If the shooter had been brown, he woulda been branded terrorist in minutes. Race does matter in debate
Share the Video to raise awareness, #PrayForVegas #PrayForLasVegas
My condolences and respect to their friends and fam of the victims. Helping out would be more useful. Peace out 
Your prayers are #crocodiletears. Return #NRA $ you've accepted & join sane #Americans in fight for #CommonSenseGunControl #LasVegasShooting

Mass shooting/killings: USA:
2017 Las Vegas, 59+
2016 Orlando, 49
2007 VA Tech, 32
2012 Sandy Hook, 27
GOP/PACs/NRA: Why is there a pattern?
I'll mourn in American terrorism. A family, anger would be immeasurable in the grief by which everybody and the people are everybody.
Time to totally BAN Guns in America.
Sending prayers to all impacted by the Las Vegas shooting.  I'm hopeful that the investigators are thorough... "lone shooter" ??? 
All casino hotels need walk through ex ray machines to check peoples baggage before they check in to the hotel

Sadly that number isn't working
Wish I could

Are they still looking for blood donations?  I know the turnout was big today.  But, there always seems to be a need for it.
Praying for all them
