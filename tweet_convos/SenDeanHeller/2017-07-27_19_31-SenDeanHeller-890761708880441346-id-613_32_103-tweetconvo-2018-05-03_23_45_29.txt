Really, dude? Millions could die because of the #SkinnyRepeal and you're talking about a Cadillac tax?
Why didn't millions die before Obamacare? Are you listening to fake news again? lol
Nobody was ever turned away from healthcare before Obamacare. If you believe anything different, then you believe fake news. Sorry 
That is absolutely NOT true. I went to the emergency room twice during that time and had surgeries without any insurance. 1/2
I made arrangements with the hospital for payment. I know for a fact you are wrong!
And Jacky Rosen just got another $ from me in response to your tweet. A dollar a tweet for @RosenforNevada  Tweet away traitor Dean.
Heller is a shameful representative in DC to all Nevadans. He bows to Trump's demands and is a coward. We deserve better.
Dean doesn't want Nevada to get more health ins carriers?  Wow.
An updated Obamacare map — with new OH entrants, we’re down to 19 counties with zero carriers. Mostly in NV, a few in IN. 
Who cares!!
#FAIRtax
You people are totally incompetent. We want a #FullRepeal and Lower taxes. Stop with the nonsense.#RememberAmericanRevolution. Tyranny.
#Flattax #TaxReform. Try what Cruz suggested. Lower taxes and simple tax code. #FightForLiberty.
Traitor.   You're gone, gone, gone!
This was a gimme by the Senate/HOR to help you save face after you voted for the ACA repeal. In 2015 you voted to delay this tax 'til 2020.
Vote.
No.
.@SenDeanHeller your base has lost confidence and Dems wants someone else. Try this last resort: Quit trying to be all things to all people.
Congrats Mr Heller. Now let's do the people's business. Repeal & replace.
There is no plan to replace, the GOP can't even get their head out of their asses, you expect them to come up with an actual plan?
No, I don't.
So glad you listened to us! I can't afford 10,000 every year. Not sure if everyone knows what the Cadillac tax would hurt them!
This is called saving face! If you really supported this bill, in 2015 you would've voted to repeal it then, not delay it until 2020.

You CANNOT  vote for this #SkinnyRepeal @SenDeanHeller. People in the Great State of #Nevada will die. Please don't do this!
You have another chance to do what is right for your constituents & vote no on #SkinnyRepeal
#dirtydean is Steve Wynn's stooge
WE THE PEOPLE demand conservatism from so-called conservatives! Do your sworn job!
Hope you get sent packing because you are too weak and impotent to stand up to Trump.
If you vote yes on McConnell's "skinny" bill tonight, you're a disgrace.
Shame on you. NYT reports 285,000 Nevadans will lose their insurance. And one US senator will lose his seat permanently. Wanna guess who?
Two years from now no one will remember @SenDeanHeller was ever in the Senate;a tumbleweed nonentity who did his worst before blowing away..
Heller is not listening to the people of Nevada. He is bowing to the demands of the idiot called @realDonaldTrump. Replace Heller in 18!
Have fun because you WILL NOT be reelected if you don't support President Trump..!! That's a promise..!!
Pathetic-who care?  You voted to take HC bks the President told you to do so as his puppet and you hid from us like a coward.  Bye Bye 2018
You voted against repeal and have nothing to be proud of.  Since you'll never get support from Dems, what will you do without Republicans?
Coward.

An updated Obamacare map — with new OH entrants, we’re down to 19 counties with zero carriers. Mostly in NV, a few in IN. 
Nevada, Heller still working hard to take away your health ins. benefits.
LOL Heller has now signed onto this stinking pile, which guts Medicaid. cc: @RalstonReports https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/889568265403551744 …
I promise to work for and donate to your opponent for your Yes vote tonight. #coward
Thanks Brent. Please meet Jacky Rosen.  She is Heller's Senate opponent. Please donate!! @RosenforNevada
I am all in. I don't even live in Nevada, but Heller is toast and I'll be a part of it.
Need an amendment to purchase insurance from any State; be able to purchased non Obamacare insurance of choice to the individual not the gov
@SenDeanHeller Are you kidding that this is what you are tweeting when Sen about to kill healthcare via secrecy and total partisan BS-SHAME!
It's only partisan because Dems refuse to help fix something that's obviously broken. Politics before people.
Fixed yes repeal and not have a replacement No nomaybe next time your sick avoid dr office and see how far that type of healthcare helps you
My family was forced into the exchanges because my employer couldn't afford to insure us post ACA. Unusable insurance is like not having it.
We all want the same affordable plans let's make that clear. If insurance companies agree to make little less money or regulation is needed.
Have you found another job? I'd start looking before 2018 gets here. I heard Russia needs workers.
Nothing "Proud" about you senator.  We saw your vote.
you and everyone else is taking credit for it.
You proud you back stabbed Nevadans voting yes on a healthcare repeal that will leave 100,000 Nevadans w/o coverage? 2018 is coming fast!
WTF - I guess you didn't like the Senate cause you will not return after 2018.  Thank you for handing us your seat - The Democratic Party
Even after @GovSandoval Sandoval handed you the easy out dude?
Shocked you voted for skinny repeal!  Disgusted and Sad! Is that what your constituents wanted?   May you stand up for the little M.  No Mas
Says the man in the Cadillac plan.
Goodbye, hope you find a new career to try.
What The Hell Was Dean Heller Thinking? - HuffPost
Proud would be your standing up 4 thousands of your constituents & millions of Americans. Dismal vote & deal w devil u made.
Oh good make more money for the wealthy nice, you traitor 
Uh yea.. we also saw you get on your knees for this fake president and vote for skinny care, anything for a win.....bubye
U also glad that U will go down as voting in favor of that "skinny repeal" He humiliates U and U don't have the cajones 2 stand up 2 him SAD
Doomed! Are you in I don't give a fuck anymore mode?
I respect you for your vote, but you let the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump bully you to #VoteNo . We need a Senator to stand up, not be a coward
I can't BELIEVE you voted YES for that healthcare bill. You don't work for Trump - you work for us Nevadans. You think HE voted for you????
You're slowly killing all of us but you'll be part of us soon without coverage. I think you're in the correct age to get screwed over too.
Phase I: Protect ACA
Phase II: Spend 15 months fixing it
Phase III: Never, EVER be trusted again by conservative voters. #LyingLiarsWhoLie
Sorry to see you voted for the skinny repeal, we won't forget
On June 23 you lied to NV and said u would not vote to repeal- last night you stood by trump and voted YES to strip healthcare from millions
Yeah.  You bailed out the Democrats with Unions. Great move on that one. Dems all voted No on your Repeal. @KevinNR 
http://amp.nationalreview.com/article/426748/democrats-asked-obamacare-now-try-duck-out-paying-it-kevin-d-williamson …

May you burn forever down below.
Not impressed with you at all
#VoteHellerOUT
#TheResistance 
#Resist
This is what you tweet after a yes vote, you lied to  constituents. #VoteHellerOut  He doesn't represent Nevadans #SkinnyRepealFAIL
Shame, shame, shame on you. We will never forget. #trumpsrubberstamp.
Wow @SenDeanHeller

You voted YES to take Healthcare away Nevada's children, veterans, and disabled

We will not forget this in 2018
Shame on you.
The only thing you'll see passing is your senate seat over to @RosenforNevada - us Nevadans won't forget. #SkinnyRepealFAIL
coward!
I hope voting for a shit burger was worth losing your senate seat. You tricked us into thinking you had a spine. Enjoy being a lobbyist soon
Folded like a cheap napkin. #Notmysenator
No tweet ur vote 4 the Bill? Ur COWARD & traitor. U will never get reelected. Stay in DC w ur orange father, no place 4 u in Nevada. SOB!
Bipartisan support? It was 52-48 along party lines
When I vote for your opponent in 2018, I'll be sure to salute the middle finger you gave us. #HellerHatesNevadans
I don't understand how your body holds itself up with that big missing piece.
Off the subject you should be so ashamed to let a dying man take the hit when you could have stood beside him and voted no. Last term POS!
Really? That's what you're bragging about? I hope you're thinking of what you'll be doing after you lose in 2018.
We saw what you did last night and will vote accordingly. You showed constituents that the GOP agenda is more important than their lives.
Sorry to see you cave to tRump & his cronies-it's ashame you don't have courage like McCain, Murkowski & Collins. Tsk, tsk
Graham called the skinny bill a fraud and disaster- then you voted YES, u lied on June 23 in front of NV! Spineless loser. #sleazy
I have baked a soufflé with a stronger backbone and tougher skin then Dean Heller. That's right, your weaker than a puffy pastry. Your fired
You let Nevadans down @SenDeanHeller with your cowardly vote for stupid "skinny repeal."
You thought you were slick in avoiding roll call to let Songbird McCain cast the nay vote. Don't think this won't come back to bite you.
You caved IN ...Trump COWERED you... with people of Nevada at RISK. #SAD
Dean voted YES to take your healthcare away to give TAX CUTS to his rich buddies! #ByeFelicia 
@RosenforNevada is on your side! #NVVoteRosen
I'm backing your opponent next election.
Ur not a senator for the ppl. Ur self-serving & mean. On every vote to be kind towards people & animals u choose cruelty. Shameful
..you know you just made a pact w the devil! U voted for the #skinnyrepeal and you will pay the price for that! U will be voted out! #resist
You will be voted out! Enjoy your last year in the Senate. When you stand up for billionaires like #stevewynn instead of your constituents..
In order for capitalism to succeed there must be competition mergers and in-state monopolies remove competition so capitalism fails simple
Glad you're proud, but we are not proud of you!
Nevadans have had it with Heller. We must replace him next year. My contributions are going to @RosenforNevada
I've never seen a liar and a coward vote themselves out of office before. You are both, good job Dean.  #2018 #Jackierosen @RosenforNevada
Does Trump make you wear a ballgag when you two are alone together? Or is it a leather mask with a zipper over the mouth?
Now back to the Edsel legislation your party calls health care reform.
You may be male, but you are no man! Creepy Coward!

Too bad you didn't have the courage to vote no on health care...so disappointing.
You let us down. You are on the wrong side of history. You are wrong for Nevada.
Cadillacs vs. healthcare?  Priorities. Priorities.
your last legacy will be giggling like school girl sitting next to @realDonaldTrump -- you must be proud. congrats. #littlebitch.
or did Stevie Wynn step on your throat when he stopped by DC the other day. either way the result's the same. #littlebitch
I'm proud to have watched you finish yourself off last night. 

seven years and the fact you weren't prepared shows you're not worthy. #out
Coward @GOP lackey. Bye bye Mr useless
You let John McCain take one for the team because you are a coward. Ironic a veteran put the nail in the coffin.
#DeanHeller betrayed us all with yes vote despite his promises. Follow @RosenforNevada and vote @RepJackyRosen in 2018
Jackie Rosen's contributions are pouring in. Dean, you could have made us proud.... but NO.
#MHGA make healthcare great again IF you can find your spine Voting yes when you meant "not really" You're making NV a joke

I hope you enjoyed your Yes on the skinny. Shame
If you are looking for your balls you'll find them in john mccains pants.
Sen Heller you shouldn't be so proud. Failing to fix Healthcare is shameful. Cadillac tax only helps the rich. Do your job or get voted out.
You blew the chance to make a real difference. Sad.
How out of touch are you? According to your repeal vote last night VERY.  #Nevada will take you down @SenDeanHeller #BattleBorn
Nevada has been burned by you again.  GOP party over Nevada.  We get it. Thankfully our neighbor @SenJohnMcCain stood up for Nevadans.
A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. Dean has failed Nevadans.  Despicable vote.
And that's good? Maybe good 2 protect those who have employer based Ins, but makes it harder 2 repeal 4 rest us who have 2 buy our own.
You blew it.
Don't Try & change the Subject, U Coward!!  I Know your voters will Remember how U Tried to Take Away their Healthcare & God Sees EVERYTHING
Of course u got that one passed. I'll never vote GOP again #repealACA #GOPliars
Good luck in your election 
Made my donation to Jacky Rosen. Your cowardice will cost you.
Sell out - nice to know you don't actually have a spine 
You will lose- the next election- you wimped out- your political career is over
Coward..... You just lost you job for not being able to stand up to an Oompa Loompa pimp.. SAD!
It's unfortunate Nevadans have to be associated with you.  It's embarassing.
And we're u also proud to vote for the "skinny bill"? I'm embarrassed that you're my senator.
#senHeller You are so spineless. You allow a bully to get to you then vote against the interest of your constituents. Shame on you.
#Repeal Heller.... He voted YES!!!#Shameful Heller....Time to Go
You and your colleagues are absolutely thorough failures.
Didn't work out so well in the end though did it?
DONATE TO JACKY ROSEN FOR SENATE IN 2018!! PERMANENTLY REPEAL & REPLACE DEAN "THE SLEAZE" HELLER!!
You suck part 5!
Good morning from the east coast Deano. They put you in a real tough place and now you're out in 2018.   #Balls   #NV
Proud to see the Senate DEFEAT "skinny repeal" of OBAMACARE! ...and YOU were on the wrong side of history!!
Dean blowing his own horn. Dean Heller soon the be REPEALED AND REPLACED!
Don't think ocare repeal failure saves you. You are guilty of attempted murder of thousands of your constituents. A dem will have your seat.
You voted to repeal ACA with a horrible bill .  Nothing else matters really.
You coward, see you voted out next year!
You won't show up for town halls and listen to your constituents, but your constituents will show up in droves to vote you out.
How's it feel to throw away your vote, your morals, your reelection, all for nothing?
you better look again!...EPIC FAIL!....stop smoking weezy....and try reading without stuttering and bumbling...
Someone is going to lose their seat 
You let TRUMP punk you again
YOU could have been the hero tonight. You could have been the hero. So disappointed in my state Senator. Boo.
Bet you sold Nevadans to the devil and are going to join the administration. A little blackmail from the Rump? Threatening your job? Puppet.
That's it; pat yourself on the back, just like your new buddy the president, when you screw over America and Nevada constituents. You're OUT
*You're*  Sorry folks, I'm a bit PISSED OFF at this COWARD rn 
You are an embarrassment.  Bye bye Mr. Senator.
Congratulations Senator!
Very disappointed to see that you were bullied to support this healthcare bill that did not pass. 
You chose party over your constituents tonight. You should be fearful of them more than Trump.
You put the last nail in the coffin with that vote, buddy. What a coward you've proven to be!  Can't wait to vote for Rosen in '18, buh bye
Turns out 2 Republican women have more Cojones than Heller.
your yes vote just cost you your seat. Hope it was worth it. Hang your head in shame and look for another job for next year..
I'm not sure what that means in the real world.  Does that mean it's part of the HC bill, or was it made moot by the vote tonight?

Whistleblower Tarref Simon needs help in bringing attention to the VA. https://twitter.com/refee00/status/880540730174967810 …
You're a walking contradiction. Say 1 thing and do the opposite.
Aka a liar. Vote the liars out
Explain your vote.
You will forever be known as a politician that chose party over people and voted to rip healthcare from millions. Disgraceful
I can't wait for your re-election! #YouWillBeReplaced 
hey dean it was nice being a senator...
Thank you to your colleagues @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins who did the #GOP proud and fought for their constituents.
You lost my vote, I will never vote for you again
Nevadans will remember how you voted this morning.
