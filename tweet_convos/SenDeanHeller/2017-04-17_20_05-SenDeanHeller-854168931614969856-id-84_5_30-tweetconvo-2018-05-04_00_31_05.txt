What about the H2B program?!?! #saveh2b
You're so full of crap  start looking for another job in 2018.
The voters are coming for you buddy!
It's really not any use to respond. What you say and what you do is are two different things. #TheResistance
.@SenDeanHeller I'm not usually a fan of snuff films, but watching the video of your political career dying today was exhilarating. #2018
We may be heard but you're not listening!
You haven't even heard ours!  Host a town hall down south and make sure the venue holds more than 100
Still want to know your answer to how many Russian spies need to be in the WH before you investigate? You're a stain on our democracy.
Thank you for protecting our interests.
Planned Parenthood Salaries are outrageous.  This is proof they don't need our hard earned tax money. 
Please defund.
You have made it clear. You only fight for POTUS policies and disregard your constituents!!
How about education and healthcare?  Those don't seem to bother you much.  Nor did Gorsuch.  Still voting party over #Nevada in my book.
How much did you care about the hundreds of us locked out of townhall yesterday cuz you didn't want to move to bigger room?
Sen. Heller why did you book a room so small today at the Reno Convention Center? There wer at least 500 people outside that couldn't get in
I was one of them.  That's ok.  I will definitely be let into the voting booth. What was the chant?  No Dean in 2018!  #Nevada
My voice was pretty loudly complaining against Gorsuch. Called you and faxed you about it. Took your poll. Where was my voice then?
Sorry you didn't address how your GOP and Trump travel policies hurting NV economy.
Nevadans did not want Gorsuch. We have changed, but you have not.
Planned Parenthood,  Do you support this group?
NO GMNT SHUT DOWN. IT STOPS MILITARY, VA BENEFIT CHECKS AND SS PAY. WE CAN NOT LIVE LIKE THIS. NOT FAIR TO CITIZENS
Bullshit
Sen. Heller lied to my face about Planned Parenthood: Donna West http://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2017/04/21/sen-heller-lied-my-face-planned-parenthood-donna-west/305856001/ … via @rgj
Why didn't you listen to us about DeVos and Sessions?
Nope. DeVos, EPA bull, not calling for Russiagate investigation...
Wow you lie with impunity ! Your votes did not reflect your constituency. You are a complete disaster working to vote you out and 2018
Calling BULLSHIT
I'm calling it with you!
What a joke!
Really?! When will you have a #townhall in #vegas? You ignore my calls/emails/tweets. You don't represent #NV
What about our immigration and ID fraud problems?   Casino's in your pocket?  Because You did not say anything about that!
you hear Nevadans, but what are you oing about it.. we can replace you next election
Please stop our tax dollars from funding #PlannedParenthood .
They are making millions in profit on abortions.They do not our hard earned $.
How can you do that if you don't listen to NV voices in the first place? We want a town hall! #HellerTownHall
No, you're not!
dont be a sisy.. get tough with the liberals who are the same as isis.
I suggest you get a hearing test. You are deaf to your constituents.
certainly hope so.
You did attend the Reno Town Hall, right? Sure sounded like my fellow constituents don't agree with your "fighting" for us. #noin2018.
You ignore your constituents... Betsy Devoss, ACA, Planned Parenthood, & the list goes on. Vote you out in 2018. NV swings Democratic.
Remember  the people of Nevada need actual health care not unaffordable "access" to "options."
Your position on the trump administration and Speaker Ryan, Maj Leader McConnell? Let's hear your voice on that!
Trump Puppet ! .@MarkAmodeiNV2
No, you don't. Please don't act like you care what Nevadans want or need. You are a joke. You will find out when you're voted out in 2018
You lied about your voting record on Planned Parenthood.   You are a puppet for your party. .@SpeakerRyan .@MarkAmodeiNV2
Full of bull You're out in 2018!
Time to stand or fall . . . Country or party.
#Trumprussia 
#TrumpColluded
For someone who barely beat an awful candidate in 2012, you seemed to have learned nothing about #NV voters since then.
Where r his taxes? Oh, and investigate his corruption. #2018iscoming
Dump # yucca make those states that used nuclear dispose of it in their states, Nevada is not a dump for other states.
And vowing to protect @PPact at the state level. This NV progressive applauds you and will hold you to your word.
U have tons of support @SenDeanHeller #NVDems r worried about losing their handouts, keep fighting 4 what's right. Don't #townhall in #vegas
Handouts? Are you kidding?? What I want is someone they represents #equalrights #healthcare #WomensIssues. Heller avoids and ignores.
You are not voting in congress as the ppl of Nevada want you to Dean.  You could care less as your focus is self interest & GOP w/out regard
no you're not. You didn't even know a staffer posted a divisive Reagan quote on your FB page today. You're clueless.
Hope you really heard the voices of the people today in Reno. You will be held accountable for blindly following Trump
You may have heard their voices but you didn't #answer their #questions. We al saw the video from #CNN #Nevada #TownHall #political #puppet
#2018 goodbye
You are a Sad little man. You only rubber stamp our Sad little president.  Your nose is getting browner every day!
#2018
You mean in behalf of Republicans and your president
That's right my @POTUS and my country, if your here illegally get the hell out!
@PPact Senator if you listen to Nevadan voices you need to protect Planned Parenthood and protect services for both women and men
Yes, men are PP patients. Men also contract breast cancer
You are such a liar, you do not listen to your constituents.  You only care about your party which you always vote with!
Except on DeVos, Pruitt, Mnuchin, or your support and cosponsoring the Firefighters Cancer Registry Act.  #FactsMatter
Support women. Support Planned Parenthood.
Dump planned parenthood, make it support its self if it can!

Talking over a constituent with MS is not making sure all Nevadans are heard!
Yeah no. We said no DeVos and you ignored. We called your office and you didn't pick up.  Don't expect us to go to bat during midterms...
You confirmed Mr. Ryan Zinke.
Ryan Zinke has overturned a ban on #hunting with lead bullets. They kill Bald #Eagles by lead poisoning. The War on #Environment continues 
Nevada Officials Hope Bald Eagles Draw Tourists http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124628594 …
Did you notice npr reported this with hellers backing trump is taking away funding. How does that maga?
"The bald eagle tour completely sold out. So did tours like Raptor, Highway and Byway and Owl Prowl." http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124628594 …
I am a dem that is FOR #Yucca . You are on the wrong side of EVERYTHING for me! SEE YOU SATURDAY
You haven't heard my voice.  Need an In-person Town Hall in Las Vegas.
What about Nevadans that get their health insurance via the #PPACA?  Do you care about us? @RepKihuen @SenCortezMasto @MarkAmodeiNV2
Yet you laughed at concerned citizens insisting you protect them with your support for their needs because of preexisting consditions (Reno)
Yes, the smiling was disingenuous today. There were serious questions; non-committal responses, not a lot of answers. DeVos was a mistake
I felt his sarcasm in his smiling and in his answer--his days must be limited--Nevadans must vote in 2018!
How do you know what our voices are saying if you won't hold a town hall in Las Vegas? Stop avoiding your constituents
If you were concerned about "NV voices" you wouldn't have confirmed DeVos. You would hold regular town halls (not telephonic). #YoureFired18
The Tele townhalls are totally scripted.  It was obvious you read from notecards.
