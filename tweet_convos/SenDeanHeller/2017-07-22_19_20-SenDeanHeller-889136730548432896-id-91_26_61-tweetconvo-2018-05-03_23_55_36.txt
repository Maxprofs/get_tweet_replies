My FATHER received that Medsl.

UPDATE: Skinny is no longer just about mandate. Door now open for waivers that hurt ppl w pre-existing conditions. (Called "1332 waivers.")

@SenDeanHeller @ElCortezLV Heller is nothing but a con man who never intended to vote no. He is too much of a coward.
Too bad YOU don't give a rat's ass about Veterans or your constituents in Nevada!!
No medal of courage for Heller

That's wonderful.... but you moved one step closer to taking healthcare from MILLIONS of people.... you're disgusting
And trump received this today
Coward:

In case you hadn't heard about this, @DeanHeller @SenDeanHeller. AARP and their 38 million members are watching. Vote no.
Glad to see this.

these 28 groups took out a full-page @nytimes ad urging Senators to #VoteNO on #Obamacare repeal.

this is a moral – not a partisan – issue. 

If @SenDeanHeller votes yes on MTP, he really blows it for Nevadans and his state. Think this @washingtonpost graphic speaks for itself.  
Please tweet your position on healthcare vote @SenDeanHeller 
We are scared that our due process & hearings are denied, care stripped.
Please, Sen Heller, stop BCRA! So many ppl in Nevada will be hurt!

#Medicaid & #CHIP cover 44% of children w/special health needs due to conditions such as autism, spina bifida & more http://kaiserf.am/2ur56vu  

She served in the @USAirForce for 10 years and now is begging @SenDeanHeller to do his duty to protect the lives of her fellow Americans. 
Senator Heller, please hold your ground&vote No on the rushed, sneaked out healthcare act. Nevadans need an improved act,not a repealed one!
don't let Trump bully you. please. Worse than Obamacare does not deserve a yes vote. it feels like genocide on the poor
Don't be Afraid of trumps empty threats. Do right for the people. CBO proves it.

The Southwest remembers.
