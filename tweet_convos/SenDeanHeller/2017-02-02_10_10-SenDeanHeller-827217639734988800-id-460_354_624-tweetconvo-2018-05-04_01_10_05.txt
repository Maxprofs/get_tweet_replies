I called your office on the 23rd expressing my concerns and opposition against Devos. You do not listen to your people.
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
yes that's our new mission to make sure he never holds office in Nevada again. To hell with Heller 2018!
count me in. I will canvas and walk wherever I need to
me too!
Please answer the phone and do you duty in opposing Betsy DeVos and the rest of Trump's unqualified cabinet picks. Thank you.
Why bother? You're clearly not listening. Enjoy these next 2 yr, Sen Heller, because in 2018 you're toast.
DeVos got through. You're in for a continued ride of a lifetime.
@johnnykats Reject DeVos
Because you have chosen to stand against the wishes of Nevadans. Vote NO to DeVos and get Trump under control. He's a menace!
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
Most of those calls were pleading for you to do what was right& vote against Betsy DeVos.  Next time pick up the phone!, Sad!
#DumpDevos

We're calling because we demand that you LISTEN TO US and reject DeVos!
faxing is easier than calling! No voicemail. No busy signal. https://faxzero.com/fax_senate.php 
Already maxed out my 5 free faxes today! Thanks!
Why? In the end, you chose to ignore your constituents. #coward
oppose Betsy DeVos, the most unqualified candidate for Education Secretary EVER!!!!

@VoteOutHeller @SenDeanHeller I'm in.
I was PART of "heavy call volume" ystrday 2DAY please #PostponePruitt IMPLORES #Nevada #Conservation #PrecinctCaptain @SenDeanHeller
do you know why they are calling? Because you had the chance to stand for something. And you blew it.
Doesn't do anybody any good to call you if you do not listen or take advise but instead let Trump Bully you. We will remember
Twitter might be the only way to reach our reps! Please do not vote for DeVos!
#StopDeVos  Senator Heller, Nevada is watching!
liar
Yet you still ignored why they were calling. You still voted for that poor choice for SecEdu
.@SenDeanHeller And not listening to a damn one of them, apparently.
Coward. Hiding from your constituents. Election Day will be your day of  reckoning.
are you still voting yes on DeVos? Because we've all called & emailed & showed up at your office to say no
Please don't support the massively inappropriate appointment of DeVos. Our children deserve better than bear jokes.
too late, made public his vote against NV students and is accepting $ from@Devos Foundation accountability #2018
Money? What money? Show me. Ethics committee?
why do you suppose that is? 
You are a coward, and your unwillingness to listen to your constituents will get you ousted.
apparently you didn't listen to the calls. Your vote for someone so obviously u qualified is a huge barrier to reelecting you
why do you think that is sellout?
I can't get through on the phone. As your constituent, I am asking you to vote NO on Betsy DeVos.
And once DeVos is decided, we want something done about our traitor leader lifting sanctions on Russia.
Oh, please, you hide out from constituents- you can't face us in a town hall- and you deserve to be booed
just saw your anti ACA commercial. Complete fabrication of the facts.What's the GOP plan for healthcare??? #GOPFraud #GOPlies
and you aren't listening to what we are saying NO on DeVos & NO on Sessions and u did it anyways! In 2018 you are outta here
You chose to stand on the wrong side of history today. You've disappointed NV.
You're experiencing heavy call volumes because Nevadans are furious you're playing party lines instead of listening to us
let's remember that next year is an election year. Voter's memory will not be short when it comes to DeVos.
this will be remembered. I hope your career tanks.
You sold your soul to the devil. Your career is done!!! You failed to listen to your constituents.
You work for your constituency. Vote No on DeVos.
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
He's a lost cause, I'm afraid. His statement on the matter made it clear he's going to do as he pleases.
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
pointless to call or write when you have already decided to follow the $ and ignore ur constituents. Accountability #2018
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
Please do NOT vote for the obviously unqualified Betsy DeVos. We care about our kids' education. She'll destroy it.
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
NVs education system is bad already.  DeVos will kill it. Don't ignore your calls. Do the right thing.
If he doesn't listen that we #VoteNoDevos we need to #VoteHellerOut
Absolutely. If he won't listen to constituents he's gonna go.
I call every day to get answers about ACA, Russian interference in election, etc. No answers so I will continue calling.
#VoteHellerOut
please vote no on DeVos! Constituent in zip 89119
DeVos will not be good for education and must not be confirmed. Show some leadership, please.
Committing political suicide. You will go down as being on the wrong side of history.
Choose kids & vote NO on DeVos. She's spectacularly unqualified 4 the job. Hope it's not true you're accepting $ from her!!

Please Consider not supporting DeVos. She will not be good for public schools and the children of our country deserve better!
Please Be Genuine 2 Your Voters-They Don't Want an Ed Sec w/NO Knowledge & quest 2 privatize PUBLIC Ed!
http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2017/01/30/devos-nomination-senate-vote/97243810/ …

Was it @BernieSanders calling to say “We are a democracy, not a one-man show,We are not another @realdonaldtrump enterprise.”
- Yes, please continue calling so I can ignore your opinions. All these callers are voters, remember that!
Tried to call to plead for your NO vote on Betsy DeVos. Strong public schools are more important than rubber stamp yes vote.
, like you even care!!#hypocrite #byefelicia

- How much money does it take to get you to represent us? Just so we know.
VOTE NO on nomination of incompetent idealogue Betsy Devos @BetsyDeVos

1/2 Sen. Heller, please do what is good for the children of this country by not voting for Ms. DeVos.
You will forever lose my vote if you vote for DeVos. I'm registered in NV & vote everytime.#TaketheDeVosPledge

so no to Devos and they will stop ;)
Please search your heart when you vote.  Vote your true conscience, not party. Trump politics are reactionary not solid.
why would you ignore your constituents wishes?  Exactly why we distrust you.
They are probably calling to implore you not to vote for DeVos = worst possible choice for #education and #Nevada

it doesn't matter WHO is nominated by trump, the lefites are against ANYONE Pres. Trump nominates. CONFIRM HER
we responding no to Devos listen to the people.
We appreciate your staff as they work to gather calls. A majority would like you to #StopDevos for multiple reasons.

I see a civil war on the horizon with known racists being chosen for key jobs in the WhiteHouse, etc. what a motley crew!!!
shame on folks in Congress, the Senate, and the White House for choosing folks that know nothing about issues facing the US
then oppose DeVos and we'll leave you alone (for a minute)

The call volumes are directly tied to the Devos nom. Regardless of  politics, she is in no way qualified. Do the right thing.
are you still voting yes on Devos because if you are then you should expect this to get even uglier.
