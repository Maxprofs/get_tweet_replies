@StationCDRKelly @NASA Hi Scott. You are going to almost be over Johannesburg, South Africa this tonight. How about a picture? I'll wave! :)
@DeanosT01 @StationCDRKelly @NASA if the pass is visible, the crew cannot take good pics of the area, too close to the terminator
@Rainmaker1973 @StationCDRKelly @NASA The terminator? I don't understand...?
@DeanosT01 @StationCDRKelly @NASA the separation between daylight & night; http://cdn.rsvlts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/earthterminator_iss002_full.jpg …
@DeanosT01 @StationCDRKelly @NASA they see very dark in the area from which the #ISS pass is visible.
@Rainmaker1973 @StationCDRKelly @NASA It will be around 20H00 so will be dark... Oh well, I'll still wave at ya'll!
@StationCDRKelly That's Taxicab Geometry!!!
