This Bill is Horrible for Nevada!   Please vote NO!   We can do so much better as a nation then to hurt the most vulnerable among us!
& It's horrible for Texas even tho Cruz was an author & California & Arizona & Virginia & Missouri & believe it or not Kansas etc etc...
Cruz and Cornyn were BOTH in the group of 13 men who allegedly authored this atrocious bill.  Texas WILL remember!
What party voted to defund specific parts knowing insurance companies would be forced to raise prices? Sabotage? Reps now own health care.
I have paid attention. 

Why did the Reps. withhold payments to drive payments up ?
I am a dr, this will harm Nevada pts. Insane when u read side by side with millionaire health CEO tax cuts. #bestrong #sayno
The #HealthcareBill bill cuts billions from Medicaid, which 1.75 million Veterans use for coverage. Please vote NO! Thank you, Sen Heller.
I ask you why should potus get upset about terror attack w/people getting killed/wounded when his healthcare bill will kill/harm millions!!
OMG we are all gonna DIE!! Stop it, you're killing ME!!
There's no in this bill. No compassion/understanding of the people who need Medicaid or preventative care provided by planned parenthood!
They lie. They say they don't use federal funds for abortions but don't separate the funds. So in reality they do. That's the issue.
My SC senators are apparently too coward to help us. @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott 

So please help SC too - vote NO to TrumpCare !
Thank u for standing your ground as u promised to vote no on healthcare bill. A true gentleman
I've read the #HealthcareBill draft and as a NV Republican, I ask you to please vote NO. Thank you!
He will when I campaign against him in 2018, if he votes NO.
Please vote no on the revised version;  its just as bad, if not worse.
Thank you for putting people over ideology.
Wow...  You caved and voted against NV?  I was just starting to respect you when you promised to vote against the repeal a few weeks ago.
Nevadans are counting on you Senator Heller. Don't sacrifice those who cannot afford medical care without government assistance.  Thank you.
Vot a nice boy..thank you!
Ecc. 10:4 If a ruler's anger rises against you do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.
Nice to see there is at least one Republican who honors his oath to the country!  .  Thank you, sir!
Noticed that you have a lot of speed readers following you. I think I'll really read it before commenting on it. Hope you'll do the same.
Instead of Tweeting you need to be reading!! #AHCAbill
He posted a photo of him reading it. You made fun of him on that thread. Guy can't win with you, can he?
Sure he can. As long as he does what is best for the people and not bow down to party or corps looking for more tax breaks.
Because if he does vote the way you want him to, you're going to reelect him, right?  Doubt it!  Why don't you wait to see final version.
Because I chose to speak out BEFORE the damage is done. And believe me there wouldn't be a chance in hell for reelect if he supported bill.
So punish 256 million who can't afford their insurance or now have crappy insurance so 11 million can get Obamacare. Sounds like #LibSplain
Stand your ground.  Thank you for doing what is right.
Not from Nevada but I am proud to know we have Senators who put people over party.  Protect our healthcare! Don't let the bullies win!
Thank you for standing up against a bill that would cut coverage for so many Americans! D.C. needs more courage & leadership like this
Hang in there Senator. This bill is a debacle, and many of us will crowd fund you if Adelson and Wynn purchase a candidate to oppose you.
Stay strong Sen. Heller. Vote for the best interests of your constituents in Nevada. Priority should be healthcare not wealthcare.
'If given the choice between Righteousness and Peace, I choose Righteousness.'  Theodore Roosevelt
Thank you for your no vote on this tax cut disguised as healthcare.  Health ins is a human right in Nevada and the other 49 states.
Every republican it's being unonedated with emails from liberals/pretending to be voters of trump!! They are the #resistance  #MAGA
Not only do represent the people of the state, but as  Senator you have a responsibility to all the people of the U.S.
The state expanded Medicare not the feds, the State then needs to deal with it
Are you really supporting Obama care?
18 Nevada counties losing insurance.
You have this summerlin liberals vote and support sir, thank you for putting the people before blind party loyalty
Whole lotta socialist in nevada. Dont prostitutes get health insurance ?
Thank you @SenDeanHeller -my 7 yr old nephew is medically fragile, relies on 17 medical specialists to live a healthy childhood
This bill likely means financial collapse to family, jeopardizes access to specialists & illness of a now thriving child #chiarimalformation
Thank you for standing against what amounts to a huge tax cut for the wealthy.
Consider your constituents who will lose healthcare. Please vote NO - country over party #SenateHealthCareBill
Thank you for standing up to terrible legislation that will just make 45 and his cronies wealthier.
If you ever change your mind and vote in favor of trumpcare..expect a change in our minds when we vote. :)
Penalty for not having #Obamacare has been removed.
We support @POTUS .
Please stand firm in your decision to vote No.  Any last minute tweaks they might make won't have time for a proper vetting.
I want thank you for standing up to the masters of the universe to bring decency, mortality, empathy & compassion back to US
Thank you!
Thank you for having the bravery to stand up for what is right. We will remember.
Please vote NO.  Thank you.
Thank you senator for standing up for people vs party.
This bill needs to not pass. It will hurt too many people. Please vote no.
Smells bad Senator. Heller  I hope you stick to what's right for your constituents unlike @SenToomey who is only out for party, lobby, potus
Vote no! Choose lives over tax breaks for rich. The choice is clear
A conservative would not vote for this monstrosity.  Repeal Obamacare. Don't vote for this #AHCA garbage.
@SenDeanHeller As a part time resident of Nevada, please vote NO!
Thank you for standing with the ppl. You guy need to forget about replacing it. Just work with the Dems & fix the problems.

Because the @GOP believes sick children have been "personally irresponsible" & should be punished with painful death by treatable illness? 
A bill like this has negative effects on the entire nation therefore it can't be good for Nevada either. #trumpcare
Thank you for having the courage to stand up for the American people. U vote NO. Ppl will remember & reelect.
This Californian stands with you. Don't let anyone bully you into a YES vote!
My premium under Obamacare is $1700 a month. GOP senate bill's got be a lot better than this! Vote "Yes" on Senate healthcare!!
Vote no! We stand by you!!
Stand tough, Sen. Heller. History and the majority of Americans are on your side.  #AHCAKills #AHCA
I request you vote against this bill in any form. It's a cash grab for the very wealthy at the expense of sick people.
Thank you for standing up for people who might not be able to.

Sen."if it's good for Nevada,I'll vote for it."What about the other 23 million Americans? Conscience not politics please, vote NO.
A politician with morals. Wow! American lives should mean more than politics
The state to decide and allocate funds needed for every state, since each states are different.
I believe it's also a good idea for federal and state to share the Medicaid cost. It's not a cut it's more of a cost sharing. It's good for
Become A Hero! Protect Our Healthcare! #HellerVoteNo
Thank you for standing up for Nevadans and all Americans.  If you vote against this bill, my group will have your back.
Thank you for having the courage to oppose the AHCA, Senator Heller. You are doing what's best for Nevadans and the nation.
This bill will also cost tens of thousands of good paying health care jobs.  It's a killer of people and jobs. Vote NO!

#HellerVoteNo
Do the right thing for the people of your state and this country. We were moving in the right direction w/ACA. Work to IMPROVE it!! #NoAHCA
I'm a Dem who's proud of your being a man first, that cares about ALL. NO VOTE until healthcare plan is a reflection of HOW YOU CARE

Please, #HellerDontHurtUs! Show you truly care about Vets, children, elderly, sick & vulnerable.  is better than this! #HellerVoteNO
My premium is $1829 a month with $6500 deductible and $12000 for family you need to fix this and stop focusing on Medicaid
I tried providing healthcare for my employees but it was almost as much as payroll
Senator Heller, I believe you are an honorable man and will vote against this cruel legislation. Thanks for standing tall

Thank you for opposing the AHCA bill in the senate.
You need to back our President and supporter this bill . We are all watching !
Like 300,000 Nevadans, I get my HC thru #MedicaidExpansion. Thank you for standing w/ @GovSandoval, against #AHCA.
Please vote down the AHCA. This bill sacrifices Americans' health for tax cuts for a minority of us. Thank you!
Pls explain how this is good for NV, or ppl who live outside your state. Your vote could hurt us too.
PLEASE vote NO! #HellerVoteNo #HealthcareBill
I read the healthcare bill! My only problem I see is, I believe all Washington Politicians should have to use it also!
Thank you for saying NO to trumpcare and taking a stand and caring about the people
My statement on the U.S. Senate's draft and the U.S. Representatives. Don't any of you ever refer to yourselves as Christians. It's a lie.
I applaud the NO vote, but what will make you vote yes? #TRANSPARENCY
Praying @SenDeanHeller will vote against the horrid healthcare reform bill.  So many lives need to be saved.
I think he says he'll vote against it, but we need more Republicans to vote against it.

Thank you @SenDeanHeller. Vote no.
Thank You for Saving MY LIFE. I am 61, perm injured at work in '97. Med Expenses over $1.5 Million so far. Repeal ACA will KILL ME!! @GOP
Your refusal to knuckle under to Ryan, McConnell, & their corporate owners is truly inspiring. Keep fighting for Nevadans--and democracy!
It would be foolish to vote for a bill w/ 16% approval, no input from industry experts, strips away coverage and GOP will own the mess.
Thinks the left will vote for him, but they won't, they'll vote D, you won based on Repeal not keep Ocare, you will lose cause yu said No
All @SenateGOP @HouseGOP elected since 2012 Won on Repeal /Replace Ocare! Now think Do it = might lose '18, NO! don't =you lose '18
Please vote no!
Please vote no.  Stand strong for people
Not just Nevada but also the whole country.  Please vote no!
It needs more conservative free market solutions.  @SenTedCruz has 4 great amendments.  Push for them!
#HellerVoteNo  & don't let them pick on you. Why aren't they doing same to Cruz
I beg you to search your soul, draw strength from knowing right from wrong and vote NO.  DO NOT be swayed.  You are strong.  Be strong!

Stand firm, vote "no" to leaving millions of Americans without healthcare. #TrumpCare
Thanks for voting No. You are saving lives!
Thank you for voting NO Senator Heller !
No subsidizes, just repeal " break up Ins.&drug monopoly then we will have a free markets.
More people on Medicare will kill actual healthcare. DO THE MATH!
What now?

Do you know how insurance works?

The more people in the Insurance Pool, the cheaper it is for Everyone
That's not how Medicare works. Medicare does not reimburse healthcare providers enough to cover the cost. Negative revenue doesn't work.
Vote No on trumpcare! Country before party.
Thank you Senator Heller for putting your constituents and the American people ahead of party.
I read it.  Not good for NV.. I live in Reno, and I thank you for opposing this legislation.  Bad for NV, bad for USA.
Please continue to stand up for us and vote NO on the Senate hc bill.
Please vote NO.
Encourage you to bring accountability to VA and humanity to the AHCA.
I want my tax dollars to go  for Health Care, not take the money I pay along with other tax payers, and give my money to millionaires
Pulling out. So don't be bullied by the Democratic Socialist Commie snowflake cucks.
Vote YES! It's time to repeal and replace Obummer Care before over 20 million are without insurance anyway. Because nearly all companies are
Stay strong Senator Heller. Don't let Trump bully you into cheating your constituents
#RepealObamaCare
#HellerVoteNo because your constituents' lives are more important than tax cuts for the wealthiest
Thanks for being there for the people of Nevada!!! This bill is horrible.
Please,sir #HellerVoteNo!
I rely on the VA for my Healthcare. This Bill reduces my ability to attain that care!

I know you've said NO. But I want my Voice Heard! NO!
Sitting here wondering if I'll still have health insurance in NV... Please #HellerVoteNo
Keep listening 2ur consts.Dont let attck ads sway u.U wll gothe R side of hstry.Repub need 2come bck 2 cntr.Thn u wont lose
What you do affects the ENTIRE country not just your constituents. Think about that - the whole country depends on you to save our care.
This bill isn't good for anyone but the 1% and you know it.  People will die and history will not be kind to those who enabled it.
#HellerVoteNo
Thank you for taking a stand to look after the best interests of the people you represent. Other legislators should do the same.
Freakin RHINO. Hear UR up for re-election in 2018. Good luck w/that one, you won't have our households vote. Quit holding up POTUS promises!
@SenDeanHeller: Planned Parenthood is good for thousands of Nevadans without access to primary healthcare providers. #StandWithPP
Thank you for opposing the senate Wealthcare bill. Please stay firm and don't sell out on this terrible bill that will harm millions!
There are way too many able bodied people on Medicaid.
Middle class Americans are being forced to carry the burden of Medicaid expansion. Our employer related health premiums increased 2 cover!!
Medicaid needs to be cut! It's time for personal responsibility. People having 4,5,6+ kids they can't afford cause they are paid to!
What SPECIFICALLY regarding the Medicaid EXPANSION are you concerned about? Dean Heller is the swamp! #DrainTheSwamp
Please stand strong on this. Don't listen to the ad blitz by the big money far right.
The bill is bad for everyone except the rich. Please vote no. Thank you.
Thank you Sir, for voting No & having human decency. I know the peer pressure from the GOP must be immense, but causing a Holocaust is wrong
Thank you for doing what's right for the people you represent. The bill put forth strips health care from millions. It is appreciated. 
Please vote no on #ACHA. This bill will be devastating for people w/ disabilities & chronic conditions.
Vote NO!!!!!
What kind of world do we live in, where people literally have to beg for their lives, to keep their healthcare?!
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628 …
Stay strong & vote no. Don't let super pacs intimidate you. AARP & every senior will have your back. Seniors vote!!
Thank you for your NO vote on the new #Healthcare proposal!!! It's a lose, lose for all Americans 
I hope you'll cut my parents a check for the increased costs in their premiums due to Obamacare that you won't repeal.
#HellerVoteYes? No. @SenDeanHeller be an American first, a Nevadan second & a Republican last. Put people over party every time. #VoteNoAHCA
Thank you for standing up for all Americans. We need more senators with your backbone.
You know this bill is bad for countless reasons. FIX what the GOP has done to ACA and we will have a winner. #HellerVoteNo
Please, sir, vote against the proposed healthcare bill, it is a tax cut for the rich at the expense of Americans who need access to care.
Thank you for thinking of those who can't afford insurance--and the burden cutting Medicaid funding would put on the states. #HellerVoteNo
Stay the course. Humanity over Hannity. Country over party. Don't let them scare you or beat you down. The whole country is watching. Thx.
Thank you,  Sen. Heller, for standing strong to protect your constituents. I wish my Senators cared about me. @SenJohnThune @SenatorRounds
Stay strong against the intimidation from your own party.
Hello, I am not a Rep. I do not live in Nevada, however, I just want to thank you for taking a stand against healthcare bill....
This bill may not be perfect but it is better than Obamacare. Once we get it passed we can fine tune it, but we have to pass it first.
Have the courage to do your job and vote NO on this sham #HellerVoteNo
Thank you for your support and dedication to protecting your constituents- please DON'T CUT A DEAL OR GO BACK ON YOUR WORD! # Deathcarebill
Thank you. Your constituents' health is more important than tax breaks for the rich.
Thank you Senator Heller. #WeDeserveBetter
Please continue to stand with people who need your voice and vote in order to keep their family healthy! Vote 'no' & be the hero we need.
Sen Heller, thank you for showing strong leadership & doing what's right for our country & not for party.
Thank you for your integrity and for caring about your constituents. Please vote no on AHCA.
Senator Heller, Thank you for being an American Hero at a time when so many may lose their health coverage. I applaud your leadership!
I'm not from your state, I'm from Maine. As the parent is an adult with Down Syndrome, thank you for protecting MCare.
Thanks for your leadership & courage to do what's right for Americans' health. We need it.
It's a travesty of a bill meant to lower taxes for 1% at the expense of poor, disabled and older Americans. Vote No
