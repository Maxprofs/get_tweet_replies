Tell him he needs to fill out his paperwork or he won't be getting any hearing, not that he's qualified.
Puzder is against min. wage.  If you want a job done you must pay a living wage or don't ask for it to be done.
.@SenDeanHeller @AndyPuzder If De Vos gets confirmed, you can take anything in education off the list. #NotoDeVos
Did you ask @AndyPuzder specifically if he's provided good-paying jobs for his @CarlsJr  employees in #Nevada?
Lol!! Sat down with the anti-labor Secretary pick and discussed how to automate our workforce out of employment!
instead of doing photo ops, start voting for NV and not just Trump nominees.
The man has continually favored his purse over his  people; he ignores the needs of his employees. VOTE him down
Advising lg manu co moving out of CA; choosing btw 3 states; quality public education critical 2 their employees; #stopdevos
isn't this the same guy that wants robots to replace workers. Jobs jobs jobs

Good paying jobs for families of robots?
he doesn't want unions or minimum wage.  He doesn't want to help the worker, he wants to help the business owner.
thx for supporting someone who knows what's best for NV's 73,900 jobs in #franchising! #confirmpuzder
WTF!?!?!?
please vote no on DeVos! Unqualified, hates public schools, plagiarized!
#RejectJeffSessions #RejectBetsyDeVos #RejectStevenMnuchin #RejectAndrewPudzer

Grow a backbone heller!!
.@SenDeanHeller @AndyPuzder Can you start the labor movement by having someone clear some messages off your LV office phone?
voicemail full vote no on res 40 dean or do you like batterers and mentally ill to have guns?
I 1st learned about Puzder in a case study on unethical leaders while studying for my masters. Great choice.
so let's make it clear, you support cutting wages of workers in Nevada??
Dean-You are a weak leader. You play the congress game of how to keep my job over doing your job:serving the ppl.
Actual Puzder quote while CEO: "I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it's very American."
no more minimum wage jobs from fast-food moguls.
Have you ever had to support a family on 8.75 an hour. You don't represent me!
how about livable wages, respecting labor laws, and stop stiffing workers, all of which is at odds w/ @AndyPuzder philosophy.
needs to complete his $ ethics disclosures like Hyatt billionaire heiress Penny Pritzker (38th Commerce Sec.).
know what will grow the economy? Higher wages! Can't spend what you don't have
you could #RejectAndrewPudzer for his want to wage war on workers through automation!
Unqualified just like @BetsyDeVos. He was mentored by a mob lawyer and low paying jobs are all he knows.
think about doing the right thing Mr. Heller, I voted for you once I will not do it again!
the guy thats all about automization? No worries after ur Devos vote...not expecting you to represent the lil guy
PLEASE VOTE NO ON DEVOSS FOR ED. SECY.
NOT QUALIFIED!
Actual Puzder quote as CEO:We believe in putting hot models in our commercials bcuz ugly ones don't sell burgers
Actual Puzder quote about his OWN employees "we hire the best of the worst."
You could probably start by not appointing Puzder to the #Labor position. #WolfInTheHenHouse #SwampThing
no minimum wage! Worst nom on protecting workers
You  can ensure all receive a good education l.
Puzder is only familiar with low paying, low value jobs, bad choice!
#voteHellerout2018
did he tell you to keep the minimum wage at unlivable wages and call his employees the worst of the worst?#MAGA!
sure the guy who hates the minimum wage and ran a fast food chain.  Perfect guy to talk about good-paying jobs.
did u ask about his paperwork???
no to robots, no to cheap or non paid labor, no on pusher. Someone who cares about people should run labor dept
public schools are important for families too. No on DeVos.
#NotOurLaborSec #NVSEN
So you support someone who is against raising the minimum wage when we have so many hourly jobs in NV?
so you don't want to get re-elected? Cool cool, we will take care of that
LOL LOL LOL
Neither one of you are fooling anyone. You both HATE working families.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCVd2q-9TXk â€¦
the only viable option to achieve that goal is denying the nomination and passing a $15 minimum wage.
.@AndyPuzder doesn't care about the employee  Only cares about cash.  Vote NO on Puzder.  Try not to f this one up Senator.
the only good job right now is in the #Senate
Vote NO on this anti-worker nominee
Puzder is anti-minimum wage, anti-maternity leave, zero benefits for the worker - Vote No and support NV workers
invest in cannabis is blowing up hope on the train we have many people wanting to learn
what do you consider a good job and good pay? Puzder doesn't believe in min wage. Stop selling out NV.
how much is he paying you for your vote? How much does your vote cost since you are ignoring NV voters.
it's all about the money you can steal from the American people with you guys
Think hard over this weekend about your decision to place $$$ over quality education. We won't forget in 2018.
the Andy who doesn't believe in minimum wage?  We need jobs that pay a living wage not dead end work.
the Andy whose hearings have been postponed 4 times due to ethics problems and conflicts of interest?
NEVADA vote Heller OUT in 2018 for supporting stupid agendas like Puzder (low wage) and DeVos (dumb as a rock)!!!
Good job
This guy is no friend to working people. tRump's fake outreach to the little guy is exposed with this bad choice.
sen Heller, pls stop acting like its business as usual.
...u can't be serious if u r talking about crappy fast food jobs at Carls Jr/Hardees..PLEASE!  Let's get serious!
Trump is a fraud, a liar, and is going to sell America off for parts. Please stand up to that fascist before it's too late.
