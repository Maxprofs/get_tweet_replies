Lying #FascistCollaborator #POS my taxes are just fine.
Considering everything the Rep heavy Congress has tried 2 do 2 rip our country apart do ya think ya have any chance of getting it right? NOT
Corporate taxes as a % of GDP are <half of what they were in 1960. It didn't work for Reagan and both Bushes. Just stop the BS
If by tax reform you mean making it harder for the 1% to gobble up the middle class
Sheldon and Steve are waiting for tax reform.  
Fixed it for you.
Not if you're paying for it with impossible 3% growth.
We know how DJT reforms go, poor & middle class get screwed, while ppl like you & him hide ur money, use loop holes & get richer We  U
what we are really waiting for is your term to be up.
Using a hashtag won't turn that huge tax cut for the wealthiest into actual #taxreform.
.trying 2 screw us over yet again didn't work with healthcare won't work now #nosenate4uin18 no trickle down
Do you even read our responses... no one on this thread wants the dribble you're trying to sell. #hellerout2018
make it happen.
Heller you are so out of touch with Nevadans.
Trump's plan will entail huge tax breaks for corporations but does nothing for working Americans. Reject his plan.
GOP to English Translation: "Tax Reform" means tax cuts for Billionaires like Adelson & Wynn.
No. No tax cuts for people with all the money. Are you out of your mind? In what reality does this make ANY sense? NO. Can't con me. #ITMFA
Not for rich people
After reading the tweets you get, I can almost understand why you seem confused on how to vote. You're listening to the wrong people. Bye!
Thank God you are almost gone! I am counting down the days until you and the rest of the fake republicans are out of there!
The only thing Nevadans are waiting for is the opportunity to cast you out of our lives on 11/6/2018, forever. #FascistCollaborator
I didn't know Sheldon Adelson was now referred to as more than one Nevadan. Confused by the plural reference.
Strange that this is your message during an election cycle. You'll do whatever the Gobbler tells you to do. Both of you are RINO's.
Call it what it is / Tax CUTS for wealthy
Oh, hell no! We don't want the R version of tax reform Senator. Do not duelude yourself.
Stand up Stand up with President Trump
Nevadians has been waiting for you to go away. Who do u represent? DJT & Putin?
Wondering, is this another promise or claim you intend to brake if your handlers like Harry Reid tell you, like the obamacare repeal?
I'm counting on it!
You are not working to help Nevada, you want to ruin us to further your political career. Voting you out in 2018
Do you even listen to your constituents or is your head too far up 45's ass? The rich don't need more breaks, we the working people DO.
You're a disgrace. You know it's cuts for the 1% & no one else. Vote him out of office people. Was also a turncoat on healthcare.
Senator Heller we are waiting on healthcare reforms too.  High deductible n no insurance for NV citizens!
Taxes paid by #corporations has fallen from 33% to 9% of taxes since '52: You want to enable crooks to loot #USA:
.@SenDeanHeller is going to build a beautiful tax cut for his new bff, trump, and for his donors--and wage earners are going to pay for it.
Ain't gonna happen.  Giving tax breaks to elites for trickle down benefits don't work!  Who pays for this?  The poor & middle class!
Nevadans have been waiting for a senator that will Impeach this Russian spy/traitor you call your President YOU know what he is IMPEACH
How about taxing gaming? Mining? and not increasing taxes on those making less than 250k as proposed by Trump!
Not if your agenda is to benefit the rich and stick to the middle class, which is what pitiful-bully-dt's plan is all about.
Could you be clear what broken parts need to be reformed?
No tax reform until we study Trump's tax returns to ensure he isn't just filling his own pockets.
Hope you intend you work in a bipartisan way to achieve real reform, not just another GOP scam to enrich the richest!!!
Trump announces tax cut for himself- struggling Republican wage earners cheer!
Even MORE trickle down that hasnt worked in 30 years. Bring on the next Republican Great Recession for Dems to fix.
You must have a lot of rich cats in Nevada coz they are the only ones to benefit from tRumps reform.
For the 1%
How much $$$$$$$$$$ will Sheldon get
tRUMP needs to release his
Cut taxes for all them poor ass #zillionaires! How about starting a 'go-fund-me account for His stupid #FuckingWall??
#Sad!!!! 
Big tax cuts!! So we can find a stupid #FuckingWall he'll drag you down man! Don't go down that road!! #sad! #TXmatters! 
What I really think we'd all like?? Is some attention spent on TX!! Hello!? Taxes? Texas! Give me a break! We all know there's shady shit 
This bull crap tax reform will only benefit the rich. Reality- doesn't add up! Can't make cuts promised & build infastructure.
We were also waiting for you to #RepealObamacare. Don't screw up taxes like you did #Obamacare #FullRepeal!
Congress is getting ready to doâ€¦.nothing, Tell them you want #taxreform #FAIRtax #MTFA http://FAIRtax.org/petition  then call then 202-224-3121 
What is one single element of your (cowardly Santa Barbara plan) that benefits me?
Single 65 Head old paying 28% on a retirement 
We Vote
1st destroy the Affordable Care Act. Now, please the 1%. You will lose in 2018.
they are also waiting for affordable healthcare which you voted to take away from them
When the #taxreform goes into play Nevadens will realize that you again compromised them like you did by voting for repeal and replace.
Nevada got grabbed by its pussy
Keep supporting tax cuts for wealthy while you vote with this vile DJT administration. Are you just following Tarkanian's lead?  Grow some!
The only Nevadans waiting for your kind of tax reform are CEOs, corporations, and the wealthy. A $$ sham, like your failed health care bill.
The only Nevadan you actually care about has been waiting anyway. How much $$$ did Sheldon offer you this time? #VoteHellerOut #midterms2018
I'm sure the Koch brothers are patiently waiting-these outrageous tax cuts for billionaires are years in the making. #NotOnePenny
Why are you trying to get us to buy into tax cuts for the wealthy??? Just stop already! No amount of name changing will change what it is!
Next you will try to call it trickle down economics. As of that hasn't been a proven failure time and time again. just tax cuts for the rich
Spread the words of Trump, screw us!!!


Ok, then #SHOWUSTHEBILL! #TaxReform can't happen without a bill, and cramming like ya'll did on the healthcare bill ain't gonna fly
* casino owners not Nevadans. Fixed it for you. You're welcome
Oh come on!
No, actually #Nevada taxes are very reasonable.  This sham proposal with no details is for the wealthy.  Prove otherwise @SenDeanHeller
Tax reform as in the wealthy to pay more!! That's the reform we are waiting for!!
*Rich nevadans.  Fixed that for you.
Addendum *Steve Wynn & Adelson*
