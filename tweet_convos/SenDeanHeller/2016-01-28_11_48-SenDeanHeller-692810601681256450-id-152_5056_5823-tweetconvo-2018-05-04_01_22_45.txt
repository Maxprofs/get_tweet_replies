@NASA #Challenger I remember
@NASA @NASAJPL  I heard some of the engineers tried to warn nasa. They did not want to wait for the weather. It was all about publicity
@NASA @Jamesabeth I still remember where I was when I heard.
@c_clark_2525 @NASA @Jamesabeth I was working in a health food store in Allentown, PA, and a customer came in and told me. I was so shocked!
@brians_neck @RealIndyTaiIs24 @NASA I witnessed this event with my own eyes. It was awful!

@NASA #Challenger I remember that day clearly. My astronomy era. #childhooddrreams
@NASA Really a very miserable incident in the space history
@NASA My dad and my mom worked on that shuttle. .-. My mom kept telling her superiors that they shouldn't launch...and look what happened :C
@NASA we will never forget them. We will always love them.
@NASA Not on video! Standing outside watching the launch as I did each space shuttle launch!
@NASA sorry that f. Ring
@NASA may their souls rest in peace

@NASA To the men & women of NASA and the associated space agencies...thank you all for what you have done and continue to strive forward!

@NASA In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice so others could reach for the stars

@NASA hard to believe that it's been thirty years .. Hope the Challenger is never forgotten ...
@NASA bless them
@NASA  I personally witnessed the Challenger tragedy my thoughts have been with the families of our brave since1986 @NYTArchives @JudeCifone
@NASA seems it was yesterday I was 14 yrs old watching TV and after minute or so I was in shock, it was really sad and to this day I am sad.
@NASA I remember watching it in Science class, our teacher broke down in tears and sent us all home. Such a sad day. :(
@NASA @ConnieMackIV We could see the smoke trail from our college on the west side of the state. I will never forget it. So tragic.
@NASA Sad day indeed
@NASA true American Astronauts Heros! They will never be Forgotten! @GodSpeed
@NASA @hnktop Sonst haben die Amis ja welktweit eher keine grossen Siege vorzuweisen, da muss sowas einfach reichen.
@NASA Un error podría traer trágicas consecuencias; los seres humanos estamos llenos de estos.
@NASA 
Protegez leurs âmes sacrées, donnez leur la sagesse et la compassion
@NASA still so shocking!
@NASA The #disaster of the #challenger in 1986. I was 13 years then. It was like yesterday. #NASA Pictures are etched in memory.
@NASA Recuerdo ese día
@NASA I pray that we never forget them and God bless them!!
@NASA the cheapo doe
@NASA Spent lunch at our memorial park in Houston today. Unbelievable
@NASA then columbia happened 17 years later due to that crappy Rogers commissions and don't get me wrong Feynman knew what he was doing
@NASA A day to remember the crew of Challenger. They were scientists, explorers, and teachers - we hope our film helps that legacy live on
@NASA 30 years it doesn't seem possible. Bless those 7 heroes and to remember their families 
@NASA I remember just like it was yesterday exactly where I was watching the launch live... Never forget #Challenger
@NASA tristezza
@NASA Q.E .P.D héroes
@NASA After lunch to 10th gr high sch bio class. Asked teach "guess what!" He said, "Shuttle blew up". I said, no, fight in lunch room.
@NASA 
@NASA God Bless the loss but remember why we reach 4 the Stars  to the families
@NASA #Challenger Can't believe it's been 30 years!
@NASA How do we know what our milkyway galaxy looks like if we have never been far out there enough to take a look at it?
@NASA ..I can't imagine dying in space but I honestly feel like it's a plausible death. I rather die in a rocket than in an car. RIP </3
@NASA
Today, as we remember all who we lost, we mark a somber 30-year anniversary – the loss of space shuttle #Challenger.
@NASA No; NASA management ignored an SRB problem, which blew the ET, which shattered the Challenger.
@NASA @Nibo1960 I can imagine the QA Inspector being told: You worry too much; it ain't critical! After 2000m up it'll fall off anyway.
@NASA god rest there souls gone but not forgotten!!!
@NASA remember the day,can't beleive its 30 years ago #ChallengerDisaster
@NASA Didn't all the 7 Asrtonots lived on, one works as a lecturer & claims he is the twin brother. #truth
@NASA Bravery is a term seldom used in the right context but those seven astronauts where brave beyond belief R.I.P XX

@NASA @erthbndspcmn RIP
@NASA all of my coworkers this week have been telling me stories about the shuttle
@NASA I was in 7th grade science class watching
@NASA @auntoona remember looking up at the sky in Tampa and seeing it, big white smoke splitting in 2, not knowing what, but very strange.
@JamiaStarheart @NASA I remember that too. We knew something was wrong but it took a few minutes to really sink in.
@NASA remember it as if yesterday. Can never forget its my husband's birthday today.
@NASA can't believe that it's been 30 years already. R.I.P.
