#Nevada Senator Dean Heller voted against limits on magazine size, assault weapons, background checks https://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/10/2/1703332/-Nevada-Senator-Dean-Heller-voted-against-limits-on-magazine-size-assault-weapons-background-checks … …
The GOP Nev Senator made despicable gutless decisions when it comes to protecting the life & health of his constituents. @ktnv @News3LV @CNN
@Celazul1 Can U define assault weapons?  Also, what would U suggest 4 legislation?  Cause law abiding citizens use guns for self defense!
"what would U suggest 4 legislation?" #GunControlNow This thread:
Suggested #GunSense: 1)Tax the hell out of assault weapon ammo, 2) force owners to carry personal liability insurance for such guns,(thread)
Ok but U didn't define "assault weapon" and moved on to "assault weapon ammo", what type is that?  Did you know weapons are heavily taxed?
I’m not your secretary; do your own web searches.
  Raise the taxes on weapons & ammo.
Not that you're a secretary but not knowing the definition shows your ignorance on the subject.  Get educated then ask congress to act.
Common sense gun control please!
You're a mess these days! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Their blood is on your hands. You get to live with that for the rest of your shitty life.
Are you paying for the gas with your NRA blood money?
You can help by giving the NRA  their blood money back. And then backing common sense gun legislation. Nobody needs a silencer
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

UK Citizens OWN guns where gun violence is non-existent. NRA doesn't OWN UK GOV & BUY legislature. UK Cop Ride Along https://youtu.be/lf0ThqEdV9o 
Crocodile tears and useless "thoughts and prayers". You take blood money from the NRA.
What is your position on sensible gun control  NOW. Maybe find courage to do the right thing. You didn't on healthcare. These are Lives!
False flag crisis actors.. get real
I hope hes giving his blood money to the victims for medical bills
Your showing up and prayers won't hide your $21k+ in money from NRA that has allowed these people to be killed!  Shame on you senator!
How can you even show your face in public?
what are you going to DO to prevent the next one?
U get a SINGLE reply that doesn't reference how cheaply you sold out your constituents the American people and your own shriveled up soul?

Go back to DC! UR no use here ! You're defense your a sportsman is inappropriate!  We don't want a useless piece of crap here ! Get real :(
Why bother? You're not going to do anything.
I hear there’s a gun show there every weekend.
To do what? Share some of the $$ you get from the NRA or try to take healthcare away from the victims? Oh yeah... thoughts & prayers...
How about voting for gun control and reform? Your visit will mean nothing unless you take a stand
He can't as he's bought & pd 4 by NRA & gum manufacturer!  Total piece of crap! In NRA pocket & then says he's a sportsman! A weasel! !!
What for the photo ops? Gonna make some statements for "Reasonable Gun Control" laws???
For what, a photo op? Do more than spout empty platitudes. How many people have to die b4 u enact meaningful laws to protect people?

Stay in DC; BAN assault weapons; Don’t allow NRA donations to elected officials.
En route to Las Vegas.
You accepted more than 20000 from the NRA.  You have blood on your hands in this situation,one visit to victims won't wash it away.
GUN CONTROL NOW! Ban ALL assault weapons!
#sendbackthebloodmoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
On way to Las Vegas with @VirginAtlantic - curry or garlic sausages - what’s your recommendation - delayed takeoff but crew look great
Why bother? Insult to injury is you showing up with blood on your hands. Leave it to the clergy, the counselors, the people who really care.
What are your plans for stronger regulations on guns?
Want some of that national spotlight? You're not going to comfort the families who have lost loved ones w/ a hug- U must BAN ASSAULT RIFLES!
Good. Be brave gor once, Spesk up for sensible gun control. Stop pandering to the NRA extremists.
Are you bringing them more guns?
how can you possibly look any of these victims/family of those murdered in the face, when you accept NRA money?
En route to Las Vegas.
Your presence there will do nothing, but changing laws could save lives in the future. Did you enjoy your blood money?
How many people who had waited hours to donate blood did you push aside so you could have your photo opp??
Dean Heller: accomplice to murder.
Stay in the north. Your no vote on gun control has done quite enough.
So Dean you take money and favors to remove healthcare ? Oh and you take 20grand to let guns run rampant? Sounds like you are pro death.
Hypocrite, it's too late.
Looks like no real barriers to me
GOP. The party that profits on Americans passively or actively killing Americans. See guns, health care, race, climate, crime, energy, war
Return your NRA donations.
.@SenDeanHeller took in $21,350+++ directly from @NRA & has horrible record on reducing gun violence. 
 #SendBackTheBloodMoney
To do what? You need to go to DC and pass Gun control legislation. STOP letting the NRA Buy your Vote.
Hope you arrived safely.
Sorry Dean, the last thing the people of Las Vegas want is you showing up with your crocodile tears
Gun Control and more mental health for everyone is what is needed.
For what? You've done nothing to help hinder these shootings, God will remember.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
next a silencer? The NRA wants them legal! Live with it heller.
How much did the NRA give to your campaign. YOU ARE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS! Live with that! 10 semi automatics,a $50 crank add on and
I hope you are planning to ensure that #SHAREact and #ConcealedCarry bills fail #HonorWithAction #StopCCR
Flying in on an NRA plane?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
time to pass strict gun laws. 2nd Amendment = right to own make and model available at time of constitution adoption.
Thank you for coming
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Why? You couldn't send your impotent thoughts and prayers from DC? You're useless in DC, what makes you useful in Vegas?
NRA member eh...
Why don't you stay in DC and pass some fucking gun control laws?
How much $$$ did u take from the NRA. Hypocrite.
Why? Another bag full of @NRA blood money to pick up?
....to #ReturnTheBloodMoney ?
It's time to #SendBackTheBloodMoney & stop being complicit in mass murder of American citizens. The @nra is a terrorist organization
What the hell are you coming to Vegas for nobody wants to see you
If you're offering thoughts & prayers, don't waste your time. Americans have had it.
$21,000??? You can be bought pretty easily. Why are you going to Las Vegas? You SHOULD be heading to Washington to change some damn laws!
To do what ? Remind the survivors how much you stood up for the rights of the psycho who shot them ? #Complicit
Are you planning to donate the money you got from the @NRA to the victims of the @NRA? 

Otherwise, stay where you are. YOU ARE USELESS.
Stop talking NRA money
Why? What action do you plan to take? You can offer empty prayers from anywhere. And you can't "repair" your optics. We see you.
took in $21,350 directly from @NRA & has horrible record on reducing gun violence. 
Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Blood is on your hands for taking money and supporting terrorist @NRA
Who is more important to you? Constituents or NRA?
Only 1 way to cleana mess you've had a part in creating-GUN CONTROL. You've got blood on your hands. US Citizens want REFORM
Do you still support the position of the NRA?  Sensible gun registration is supported by the majority of NRA members, and you?
#guncontrol #LasVegasShooting
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

To do What? Campaign for silencers, armor piercing bullets and cross state line concealed carry?
You let big money influence you. We will vote you out next year regardless. Do the right thing for a change.
How's that blood money? You have blood of every victim of gun violence is in your hands. #notonrabloodmoney
To give thoughts and prayers to the people you are trying to take healthcare from while not doing anything about what killed them?
Blood on your hands, Senator. NRA mafia donation bother you at all? Enough is enough! #GunContolNow
haven't they suffered enough?
Hey Senator Heller, I know you might be keeping that NRA money for your early retirement, BUT #SENDBACKTHEBLOODMONEY
Why? You are useless...unless you can get the VA outpatient clinics in the LV valley opened temporarily as blood donor centers. Well?
So you can offer your thoughts and prayers?  Call for unity?  How about actually doing something that matters? #GunControl
Why? NRA paying you to go?
Work on gun control legislation. Now. Blood is on your hands.
Will you be talking about how much NRA money lines your pockets while you're in town? Or will you be hiding from constituents per usual?
What for? Are you going there to go back in time and prevent this? Will you meet with family and explain how you are against gun control?
You should have your ass there last night!! You have blood on your hands too.
You should have your head down at news conference. You and GOP enable these nuts. Hope you sleep well tonight. Close to six hundred on YOU.
Unless you finally stop being beholding to the NRA and pass common sense gun control legislation, blood is on your hands & other @GOP
How much money did you take from the NRA? How do you explain you're inaction on gun control to the families of the victims?
Oh, snap!  
Tell them how much money you get from NRA!
Why?  To see the results of your NRA Blood Money up close?
YOU ARE COMPLICIT IN MASS MURDER.
You have a voice and can do something that matters to curb it ever happening again, are you going to stand up or just take money? @GOP
Why?
To apologise?
What might have happened if you actually pressed for change
Heller you took $21,350 directly from @NRA 
 #SendBackTheBloodMoney #NVsen #NVpolitics
Are you going to collect the checks from the NRA?
What to get more $$$ from the NRA?
Going to pick up another NRA check?  Otherwise going to the scene of a mass killing Congress enabled seems an odd choice..
Gun control, now!
My understanding is that you rolled back regulations on people buying assault weapons. Is this true?
Another massacre caused by #TerrorismbyNRA.  #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney and do something. Please.
Will you stop by the gun show you tweeted about a couple hours before the shooting???
PLEASE keep the vote on upcoming silencer legislation in mind while you are there.
Make sure to wear an @NRA hat to your photo ops so we know who you work for.
On your way? Hope you have a good supply of floss b/c gun lobby gravy train left the station. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Stay where u are!! We don’t need ya
So what? You won't do anything, so who cares about your itinerary?
You figure your thoughts and prayers sound bite will get more views and look more sincere if you are at the spot it happened?
Please, have to go back to NO ASSAULT weapons for the public, only military and SWAT. No more excuses, DO YOUR JOB
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Stay home, this is your fault.
@SenDeanHeller you're en route to private life.
so you can turn yourself in as an accessory to murder?
You are a NRA accomplice to mass murder. You have failed your oath to protect us. #SendBackTheBloodMoney #GunControlNow
Make sure to wash the blood off your hands. You share responsibility!
You are the killer, NRA paid you to be complicit...
Will you be making a speech calling for stricter gun laws? #vegasshootings #guncontrol #PrayForLasVegas
On an @NRA jet?
@SenDeanHeller took in $21,350+++ directly from @NRA - WHy dont you skip Las Vegas and go repent somewhere?
now is the time for you to be on the right side of gun control and ban automatic weapons - lead the charge
NRA paid for I’m sure
It is not a photo op you fraud.
And what will you do? You sold us all out to the NRA. How does that make you feel? It makes me sick. You and your cronies make me sick.
Why? You took money from the NRA. Shame on you. #guncontrolNOW
For the first time in MONTHS! Where was my town hall? Why do you care now? You were ready to take away everyone's healthcare last week.
To do what, precisely? Rescind healthcare from the wounded? Make sure we can still buy assault weapons and large magazines in Nevada?
You are an accessory to mass murder:

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Delivering your useless thoughts and prayers in person? What a craven waste of skin our legislature is.
Maybe you and congress will get something done instead of that Healthcare abomination and cutting taxes for the rich
Turn around.  We don't want you here.
Whoa, Dean, you want mentally ill people to have guns. Why are you coming here?
And how much $ did YOU take from the NRA?
Next time, don't vote against sensible gun control laws, please!
Will you be handing out NRA pamphlets and offering prayers and condolences?
You helped cause this.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney NRA is not pro-hunt, they’re pro-death.
are you going to pray away the violence or actually work to help pass common sense bipartisan gun laws.
Are you giving some of the $21k you took from the NRA to help end gun violence ?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Where you will do absolutely nothing like usual
Yes God forbid you miss your photo op!! We know you don't give a shit about LV (except when it comes to Wynn and Sheldon lining ur pockets!
For what?! Ur anti gun control & anti healthcare 4 US Photo Op with people whose healthcare u want 2 cut so u can cut ur taxes millionaire!
Don't bother...give back your NRA money
#SendBackTheBloodMoney before you go home.
NRA paid $21,350 for your votes
$368/Las Vegas death(@ 58) or
$.09/total US gun deaths during your Senate tenure,2011-17(@ 33k/yr)
Worth it?
Did you pack the $21,500.00 you took from the @NRA ? #LasVegas

For what? Maybe you can ask the Mandalay Bay how the shooter checked in with his girlfriends credit card.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney  I doubt your thoughts or prayers or even your august presence will be able to offset the harm of NRA Blood Money.
Stop the shootings.  Ban automatic assault weapons and ammunition'
To makesure ppl have unlimitedaccess to ammo.  You voted for that in 2013  no one  wants to hear from you
