@nopretensehere i guess it's ok to let Iran have the ability to create nuclear devices???
@frankchristoph9 Frank, get your shit together (per last tweet), you are better than  that.
@nopretensehere ok I just don't think that Iran should have those and yes I disagree with Obama care
@frankchristoph9 Right, I don't think they should have Nukes either, we disagree about the best way to get there.

.@netanyahu Speaking under aegis of opposition party without Head of State invitation is generally how one signals support for coup d'etat.
@Tao23 @netanyahu we have co-EQUAL branches of gov't.  No permission from POTUS is required.  Wish our leaders had his clarity.
.@ljc16035 ANY 2 nations: Head of State visit without invitation of hosting Head of State = deep disrespect. Has been forever. @netanyahu
.@Tao23 @ljc16035 @netanyahu Obama's boss is us We The People of the USA and we've been disrespected by him long enough. Over the head we go
@fyre_ice I'll take your TL full of disrespect, sexual violence threats, crude insults, and racism to represent your party & religion. Vile.
.@Tao23 Great Thanks!!! Stay writing 99 cent science fiction books nobody buys off Amazon in va beach.

“@netanyahu: May we face the future with confidence, strength & hope. May God Bless the State of Israel and the U.S.A..Don't trust @Boehner
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner Screwing up a two car funeral.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner Mr Prime Minister what would you do if your Parliment invited President Obama to speak without informing you?
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner We must exit this endless war mindset! This is the guy who said Saddam's removal would be good for the ME. oops!
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner -Issue not substance, argument or fears abt Iran but manner in which you chose to do this. That was plain wrong.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner #RabbiBoehneroth - Future is mighty bleak with Republicans at the helm
@netanyahu may God Almighty bless you also my brother and all the jews, like u said in your speech we're united now not scattered abroad
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner #StandWithBibi #StandWithIsrael
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner it was an excellent and powerful speech which made Obama to speak 15 minutes about it.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner War whore only looking for US tax dollars.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner The speech reminded me that the future is filled with hope! I stand with the State of Israel and the USA
@netanyahu Amen
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner Y does the US suck Netanyahu's cock. Say what u like about UK. We wodn't let a foreign leader tell us wht 2 do.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner get lost bibi.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner United States is Okay but where is State of Israel ?? #LandGrabber
Yes. God bless all blood thirsty facsists, in Israel and in Congress. But not the brown people. @netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner Stop trying to make policy for America. You have your own country to run. No war with Iran!
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner Why doesn't Netanyahu's confidence & patience reflex his words? Not really adding up.
@netanyahu @SpeakerBoehner THAT would have been a great speech. Too bad that's not what you said to Congress.
@netanyahu you will always be my favorite foreign leader!! I have so much administration for you!!!
@netanyahu Idiocy
Just a reminder of what "self-defense" looks like for Israel #NetanyahuSpeech @netanyahu
Mass murderer & killer of Humanity  @netanyahu
@netanyahu @OhThe1DFandom may Allah bless the Muslims around the world
@netanyahu MAY U STOP THE MURDER OF MILLIONS OF INNOCENT CHILDREN!!!! Please!! THE WORLD CANT WATCH NO LONGER.
@MicRighteous @netanyahu His followers don't comment on murderous children, chemical testing on the people of Gaza, Palestine. Denial.

@netanyahu I would sit to listen to any one of your speeches over Obama (sadly).  I just wish he would take heed to your perspective.

@netanyahu God shall bless her, if Israel calls upon Him!
@netanyahu @AndrewGatward May God bless you and the people of Israel and the United States of America.
@netanyahu @AndrewGatward Thank you for showing strength in a world full of ignorance and blind guides.
@netanyahu @NWcarol28 Great blessing pronounced. Nevertheless, 'may' is a permissive word. The Lord may and can bless a repentant America.
“@netanyahu: May we face the future with confidence, strength & hope. May God Bless the State of Israel and the United States of America
