Worst Senator in America
Reject the horrible Trumpcare health bill
If U believe this & R not paying lip service 2 the issue or lying, put UR vote where mouth is & #KillTheBill #VoteNoGrahamCassidy.
Which is why the bill you co-sponsored has ZERO support for opioids?
Its a little hard to fight drug abuse when people don't have healthcare @SenDeanHeller
Nevada deserves better than you

BREAKING: Graham Cassidy repeal coverage loss, economic loss & premium increases by state.

See your state... 
Don't fall for GOP replace. They never said replace til Trump did & we know he was lying. It's always been their dream to repeal.
The pharmaceuticals should be paying for the addictions. They knowingly lied "pts can't be addicted if used for pain". I have it in brochure
Your done @SenDeanHeller The only thing worse than hurting Trumps base's feelings is having zero integrity.
Good job creating a heartless healthcare bill! That really shows you care about drug addicts...or others

Why is the latest Republican "health care" bill so immoral? My health care advisors break it down. 
You're signing in to a healthcare bill that will hurt your state. Did you actually read the bill?? Do you even know what a block grant is?
Our local paper has hundreds of lawsuits against addicts that tried to get off Oxy & fell off the wagon, they kick em out & sue em 10k each.
Pass GhramCassidy and while you're at it start working on a bill to decriminalize marijuana on a federal level.
#GrahamCassidy wrecks hope of combating the opioid crisis.
@GOP is bought and paid for. They don't care about you.
Meanwhile you can forget about marijuana being legalized, or even DOJ respecting the will of states which legalized.
Please vote NO to #GrahamCassidyDeathBill Millions of Americans are counting on you. NV isn't the only state that depends on Medicaid.
please, for the sake of all those dependent on healthcare for survival, don't vote for this bill.
#Hypocrite 
#SaveACA 
#Fixit
$125k for opioids doesn’t replace $2B in reduced funding for NV with your health insurance bill. #hellergoodbye
If you weren't trying to repeal the ACA you wouldn't need grants for this. It would be covered by health insurance plans
You can do something about it instead of making it worse.
Combating opiate addiction requires Medicaid dollars. Killing ACA = killing addicts.
"If used properly, you won't become addicted". Then millions addicted, yes even those using as directed.They should pay for recovery clinics
Your repeal puts this people in danger Vote NO
Sen.Heller, The AMA, Blue Cross Blue Sheild and most reputable medical establishments have spoken out against thGrahamCassidy bill.U support
So WHY ARE YOU VOTING YES ON THIS TRAVESTY OF A WEALTHCARE BILL?? Opioid treatment will get hit hard when Medicaid is cut so drastically.
It sounds like a bla bla bla bla, the problem exist for way to long, starts with the FDA, Insurances, health care providers, and government.
Please vote No on G/C healthcare bill.
Dean, how much did you get for your soul?
The opioids crisis demands money. For treatment, prevention education and rehabilitation. Without ACA, "attention " = watching people die.
You're vote for #GrahamCassidyDeathBill proves you're a liar or an idiot or both.
Just gave another $25 to Jacky Rosen. Repeal and replace Dean Heller!
What is in the bill? Certainly not opionid help. what happenes to the. The people that need @lpackard
Pharmaceutical companies lobbyists donate millions to GOP so Heller won't look to them to pay for a national crisis they caused.
What about the massive cut for opioidfight in new Trumpcare bill?
Yeah - have you read the healthcare bill you support? Hypocrite!
Sen. Heller, your support of the GrahamCassidy Bill will hurt your constituaents including the most vulnerable:elderl&disabled ppl &children
You'll do anything for a buck, huh?
Can't you see that only 14 people liked your statement on the grant a 97 people are confused about your hypocritical stand on Healthcare?
https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1713309898700493/ …
I just talked to your secretary, asked her to remind YOU that your vote doesn't just affect your state. VOTE NO DEAN!
Until you disavow Graham Cassidy, no one believes a word you say.  Honor your promise to @GovSandoval and protect Nevadans.
your lies are outstanding. GOP healthcare bill will take away care for million's of opioid addicts, children & seniors. True hypocrite
Your phone Box @ 202-224-6244 & office is closed? How's that? Please Do NOT Vote for Cassidy-Graham Bill! A Death sentence for States.
How can we solve the opioid epidemic if people can't afford treatment under the #GrahamCassidyBill you support?
Senator Heller, please vote for Nevada & all Americans. Please vote NO on dangerous deadly #NoGrahamCassidy
Dean star looking for a new job if you vote for this last insane death care bill
Then why does your sham of a "healthcare" bill not include any opioid funding? Liar
Remember when senators demanded $45b for opioid treatment in an Obamacare repeal bill? It's missing this time around http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/graham-cassidy-strips-away-the-few-concessions-gop-moderates-already-won … 
Just empty words as you attempt to grab a bag of money.
Listen to the experts, Dean. Your #Trumpcare bill will make problems like this worse.
R u voting no on the repeal? It doesn't cover opioid treatment. How can u vote for something that has no CBO score?
Hmmm.  Did you read the part in your bill where rehab and preexisting conditions are not guaranteed? Sheesh. #noGrahamCassidy #yourlastterm
But you support a bill that eliminates mental health treatment for those with addiction. #HellerLies #DumpDean
It's doctors killing citizens with opioids.  So.
Liar Liar Pants on Fire
You are going to take their health care away. You are trying help the youth? What about their parents. You monster.
Trump declared an opioid crisis... then nothing.
125k whoop te do.

@Lawrence Remember @DeanHeller Helped Comrades @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Assault Americans Health Care. Vote Him Out 11/2018
Huge losses for NV with people suffering because Heller wants a win! Doesn't care about people dying
Save your breath.   We know you voted to repeal our healthcare.
So don't vote for destroying our health care system then. Vote against GrahamCassidy.
If you want to help also then vote no on the Graham Cassidy bill
Or, you could just pass a legitimate healthcare bill that would cover it instead of the DeathCare bill with your name on it.
We  can't stop the Scurge of the Drug Epedemic until build a wall and control the border.
Shut-up! No body trusts you!
Yet you want to cut health insurance access to these same people? Ins would allow them access to treatment, mental health care! Shame!
Payoff, obviously
A person cannot have their opioid addiction treated if they don't have some form of insurance. You've sunk about as low as one can go.
What are you going to say when addicts have no insurance to cover treatment?
But your "healthcare" bill kills ACA which supports opioid fight AND excludes all prior proposal $ 4 fighting opioid crisis. Hypocrite
He is probably trying to figure out a way to redistribute the grant money as I type this
 funny from a jerk who is all for stripping healthcare from millions #repealandgofuckyourself #dirtydeanheller #grahamcassidydeathbill
Oh Dirty Dean, how can we trust a typical low life politician like yourself will ACTUALLY do what you say & not what your rich friends want?
You should also worry about health care in Nevada and vote No!!!
JFC, your tweets today are especially stupid and ironic! #noGrahamCassidy
No help for opioids in your Healthcare bill!
Worst Healthcare bill yet!!
what do you think your stupid bill will do to people with addiction issues? Do u know what contradiction means?
Don't vote yes on Cassidy-graham if you care about Nevada
Please vote against graham bill
Senator what a hypocrite you are. Grahm Casidy cuts addiction treatment,  women's health senior healthcare.
You can not play NV constituents
Too bad it will get worse with ur decisions on GC Bill. What an out of touch jerk
But no problem throwing them all under the #GrahamCassidy bus as long as the Kochs get their $$$?
Seriously my brother and all of his friends got addicted hard to heroin. One of the ladies I trained at my other job died of an OD .
You support a non health care plan that totally ignores opioid calamity.
#nv 's health crisis needs you to support, with your vote, #ACA because #ACASavesLives 
Your current position, @Potus ' position, is stupid.
It is a Heroin crisis not an Opioid Crisis
Senator Heller--Your YES vote on Graham/Cassidy is = to my death warrant. I'm a cancer survivor with 85% chance of recurrence. SHAME on GOP!
Connect the dots, .@SenDeanHeller. When you jerk people's health care, it doesn't fit with this statement. #NoGrahamCassidyHellerJohnson
Dean, you should really stay away from healthcare issues. Everything else too. But especially healthcare. You're not good at it.
Make insurance companies cover non-opioid pain killers:
You are so out of touch Senator. You really need a new day job.  You have an entire cannabis industry in #Nevada which can help solve this.
Graham Cassidy bill gives 0 dollars for Opioids. You should be voting no but your a YES man.
You know what won't help the #opioidcrisis ? That sham of a health care bill you're supporting
Not with crappy health plan up for votes. PLEASE vote no
And precisely why you must #VoteNOGrahamCassidy !  Please don't create barriers to health care for people most in need.
Wait, are you trolling us?? #GrahamCasiddy will decimate funds to aid in addiction recovery and raise premiums for those w/addiction as PEC.
Maybe you should not destroy Medicaid.   That's a good start!  Please save Nevada's most vulnerable population!
GOP plan will strip drug counseling and essential health benefits. We don't need a short term grant- we need healthcare. So long protections
What about the crisis where you support a bill to wipe out ACA? Save your fake sympathy. It rings hollow.
And yet your health bill allows for a $20,000 premium surcharge for people with a history of chemical abuse. That's how to handle a crisis?
Drug abuse starts by having parent unable to parent
How are people going to make use of it without Health Insurance? Graham/Cassidy=sicker or dead! Now you're going to pretend to care?
YOU are the biggest crisis Nevadans have to pay attention to and why we will remove you from office a fight worth fighting.
Know what else would help? Health care! Don't kill NV's Medicaid expansion with Cassidy-Graham!
Vote NO to Trumpcare.
How about protecting your constituents' health care, including addiction treatment, @SenDeanHeller ? How can you support Graham-Cassidy?
Obamacare will go by repeal or collapse. Get on board 2 make healthcare work. The youth addiction program should be paid by parent insurance
Then why support this awful no-health care bill?  #noGrahamCassidy #MedicareForAll #SinglePayerNow #StopKissingMcDonnellsAss
But your still going to take away their healthcare, what's wrong w/u? #resist #NOCassidyGraham
Wow is this bullshit. You're co-sponsoring a bill that could be a death sentence for opioid crisis victims in Nevada. Vote @RosenforNevada
So don't eliminate or reduce healthcare for 32 million Americans! How can you help a health crisis by removing coverage? Riddle me that!
Funny how you act concerned about this, yet you're pushing a healthcare bill that will create a bigger opioid abuse problem.
@SenDeanHeller claims Graham-Cassidy saves Pre-existing Conditions protections.
@SenDeanHeller is a liar.
Mixed signals there Dean #NoGrahamCassidy
Dirty Dean Heller, HEALTHCARE would also help w the opioid crisis, ya putz. #KillTheBill
Yea!! Medicaid!! A junkie can't afford insurance or DETOXING. Do not start with me on addictions. I'm IN recovery! unless you ARE TOO?! No!
Agreed, this does demand attention; why are you supporting gutting #Medicaid - program on the front lines of this fight - in #GrahamCassidy?
Say no to #GrahamCassidyBill
Why do you hate your constituents? #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
How about you start by saying know to #GrahamCassidyBill ?
Say NO to #GrahamCassidyBill
Just a reminder @LindseyGrahamSC @DeanHeller @BillCassidy, your Putin installed imbecile @realDonaldTrump prefers Universal HC.
