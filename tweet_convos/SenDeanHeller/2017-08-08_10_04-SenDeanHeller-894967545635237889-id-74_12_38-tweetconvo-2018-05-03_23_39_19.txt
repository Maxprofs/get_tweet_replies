Tarkanian 2018 you promised to repeal! Liar!
They BOTH suck. We need a Dem... and I'm republican
No you aren't. No Republican would say any old democrat would beat any old GOP.  And I really am democrat....
Dr.J she is a democrat bot
time for this guy to move on...how can you want support when you don't support @realDonaldTrump
With all to respect, I think you are a big waiste of tax payer money and you have shown you will sell any of us out.
You mean waste?
lol i meant waste.
GOP Sen. #Heller draws 2018 primary challenge from Trump supporter http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/10/gop-sen-heller-draws-2018-primary-challenge-from-trump-supporter.html â€¦

#RepealAndReplace
And where would you suggest we store nuclear waste? You're screaming no without an alternative. I'm so waiting for a primary in 18.
How much will it cost Mitch McConnell for you to sell us out?
#DeanHeller is a #POS how's your day going @SenDeanHeller taking #Obamacare away from #Nevadans #Nevada @SenDeanHeller #TrumpRussia
Hi Kathy, Dean Heller is the clown that allows resort fees in vegas hotels, taking lobbyist money from MGM lobbyist
You have our support over Tarkanian
Hey Dean, how about a statement on @POTUS and his threat of nuclear war. I don't wish to die from radiation and bet others feel the same.
Speaking out of the side of your mouth again?
A demented delusional dolt from your party is potus.He's talking"fire and fury" on NorthKorea&your tweeting about this. Priorities! #Resist
You voted against health care - you will pay with your senate seat. Speaking of waste of tax money - trumps spending.. our money!
Yucca Mtn Relicensed - Federal nuclear agency votes to revive stalled waste site - RINO Heller & Democrats Defeated
Trump's fire and fury rhetoric is dangerous!  Please sign on to bill to stop Trump from starting a Nuclear War!
Will never forget you voted to take health care from millions
I'll be voting for @DannyTarkanian in the next primary.  Your lies about repealing ACA and turning ur back on my @POTUS pushed me too far.
@DeanHeller While ur unhinged prez is starting a nuclear war with NK- u r silent as usual! Care to show leadership and rebuke his insanity
Another 7 figure deal for Sen. Dean Heller to sell out Nevadans he was supposed to represent. No healthcare, and bring on  nuke waste, eh?
We have a crazy man for a president. Are any of you going to do anything?  We need stability. Should we move to the east coast? Are you home
1st time in 100 yrs we have a President that hasn't been bought. "Crazy" people don't amass fortunes of 10 billion.
Lucked out!
just like your salary....
RINO @SenDeanHeller - 14 of 17 #Nevada counties will have zero #ObamaCare exchange options next year
Heller must be replaced and @DannyTarkanian is not the one. @RepJackyRosen is the only sane choice to fight @realDonaldTrump.
THANK YOU!
What about our Healthcare Senator???
Just like you a failed project cow-towing to trump the liar and include yourself. We, missed your NO VOTE on Healthcare! bye bye
Wow, 11 retweets. You are a sellout traitor, and we all know it. Can you tell it will be a bad loss? #QuitSellingOut
Then DO something about it!
@DannyTarkanian  not voting for hatef republicans!  This house is voting blue in 18
Heller has proven himself useless!
How can it be a "failed" project if it's still alive and the law of the land?
The salary of the intern that runs your twitter acct. is a waste of taxpayer money.... Wish we could bury you at Yucca Mtn. #sellout
Ur idea of block grants w Graham-Cassidy will pull the rug out form under NV residents! Passing the buck to states becuz you are indecisive
@realDonaldTrump efforts to build a border wall is yet another waster of taxpayer money on a failed project #NV see how that works!?
You're a disappointment. Danny Tartainian will get my vote next election
 That's what happens when you lie to get elected. Pack your bag!
Have some integrity. Stop playing like you have our best interests in mind. You are nothing but a GOP stooge.
Mr Heller, you and Reed played this wrong. You should of had the federal government pay the state for our education system roads in trade
Thank  your party for that BULLSHIT. The NRC chair & 3 of its 5 members are Republican. This is one of the reasons why I quit Republican.
We should look into how to get a really good deal
on using Yucca Mountain. Look into jobs, financing infrastructure & health care among so many other things we need.
Perhaps we should lo
Heller votes for Trumpcare selling out people from NV so Trump won't send a challenger for his seat. Of course, Trump sent a challenger.
With judgement this poor, not sure you should be a Senator.
It's only a failed project if you get in the way like the ACA repeal. Yucca is the smartest thing we have ever done; quit listening to DEMS
I am all for yucca and a dem!  Don't paint us all with the same brush.
Just holding out for more $$$$ to flip.
You are a #complicitrepublican who caved on health care. #traitor who loves @realDonaldTrump
"Rejects" like you will be in the next election.  You sold your base out by voting against full repeal on the Obamacare Abortion.
You're finished Never-Trumper. You will be primaried out and I will do what I can to make sure. Should have repealed O-Care.
What about all the wasted #tax #money you spent trying to repeal #ACA? Did you think we forgot about it? #GOP #Healthcare #NV #Nevada #Vegas
Ur Republican Party wants to turn Nv into a nuclear dump! It's time to dump the republicans
Hey Nevada, in case you missed it, this is how your Senator sold you out....
Vote Danny Tartainian, next election. Running against Heller. Bye bye heller
Many Repubs are holding multiple town halls. Pls. advise where and when yours are scheduled, especially Clark County. Thnx.
Like repealing healthcare and giving away our strategic resources.
Any news on your next town hall meeting?  I'm very interested in attending.
Where would you propose to dispose of our nuclear waste? Have to find a solution
Nv doesn't have any Nuclear waste
Just about every hospital generates some kind of nuclear waste
like gop's effort to revive zombie trumpcare to throw millions off of healthcare.  #gopfailure #votehellerout
get off the couch - work and pay for your own! #NoMoreFreeloaders
Your politics are bad for our state. #rosenfornevada
What do you think about the proverbial "I'll just enter every race and one day I might win" @DannyTarkanian  2 wanna be career politicians 
When is your town hall going to be in Clark County? Oh I see you have a challenger now. Time to eat your own.  NV BLUE in 18! Thanks Trump!
So how much Koch money will it take for you to flip on Yucca Mountain too? Hope it's more than you got for #Trumpcare coz you'll need it!
Please don't forget, we will vote you out!!!
Too late.  You're toast. You failed to stand up for your constituents and voted to gut the ACA when it counted. Start packing.
