You lose on your tax break for the rich or as you call it health care bill. McCain just came out NO. good day and good bye heller...the end
How can you support a bill that our own GOP Governor says is BAD for Nevada??? No Graham Cassidy!
@GovSandoval heller is a liar. Called for governors to sign off - killing NV residents! Shameful
Reject the horrible Trumpcare health bill

Now here is a hero!
Morning Dean! Just having coffee & reading about all the HealthCare Organizations that think you suck. Seriously, stop licking trumps ass..
Dean Heller. Profile in clueless. Time to head out into the  sunset.
visiting soon for the dean heller tar and feather show. heartless cruel Republican monster
And if you leave NV, there will be one more reason to visit. Your own party doesn't even like you.
We don't need COWARD & WEAK senators that don't stand for their constituents & play politics w/ their lives! NV will take you down in 2018!

Big news: @GovSandoval says @SenDeanHeller's promise of flexibility in GOP health-care bill is "false choice," could cost state $2 billion. https://twitter.com/TheNVIndy/status/911039390683721729 …

This is not a reason to visit any place.
what makes America Great is Americans. American Culture, American way of life. all other cultures come here to experience the American way.
exactly the point. we need legal people that love America, to be American assimilating culture standards to provide the American experience.
Shame on you. No #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Americans deserve better than a politically-motivated revenge bill that's cruel and harmful for millions upon millions of American citizens.
Youre really screwing up by standing with the Senators trying to HURT&KILL AMERICANS.Thats EXACTLY what youre doing.Is your Gov on board?
Healthcare is a right

Iceland locked up 29 bankers for their economic collapse. In the U.S. we just reward them for extracting all the wealth via intricate scams.
Don't be a trump puppet!  Stand up for what is right. No on the Cassidy bill.
basically every health advocacy group in America is against Cassidy's bill
When an entire industry is against something, shouldn't you listen? Pure politics over people. + Obama hate.
Wise up, Stand up for the American people, Stand up for our President Trump
Heller has betrayed the people of Nevada with his support of GCHJ. #dumpheller
cutting medicaid beyond the o-care expansion??? wow just wow
No Healthcare. No tourism.
GOP Lies #gopkills
Oh Heller...
Heller is so screwed. Sandoval just *unloaded* on Graham-Cassidy, estimating a loss of up to $2 billion for Nevada.

Are you back in Vegas now? Will you be having Townhalls?
I have 3 major operation in my life thank God I have insurance. June 12 I fainted.Received a path maker my whole bill was pay by insurance .
TRAITOR!!!
Make Nevada Great Again, Vote @SenDeanHeller Out
#dirtydean wants to yank the chemo out of your arm.







Think Nevada remembers you laughing yourself silly at the last healthcare vote?  I think they might.

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  

I hope @SenDeanHeller @DeanHeller is listening. This is my story. I'm your constituent, and I want to stay alive. VOTE NO ON TRUMPCARE.

#GrahamCassidy effect: 1.75 million vets could lose insurance PLUS the #VA crippled by 245,000 more visits per year. https://www.forbes.com/sites/arleneweintraub/2017/09/21/heres-how-repealing-obamacare-would-hurt-veterans/#58e110042d18 …

President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
You must Vote No. Your governor does not support this cruel deathcare bill.

Sen. Heller, since you are a whore for Adleson & Wynn don't you think you should register @ Fallon with all the other PROSTITUTES!
Just don't live here and get sick@or have a pre-existing condition. This Senator is not protecting NV, he's playing party politics.

Hey @SenDeanHeller if #GrahamCassidyBill is so much better than ACA why are you attempting to bribe Alaska by allowing them to keep ACA?
dean, another chart for you to see how bad this death bill is that you continue to support. #CassidyGrahamBill must be defeated

All 50 states. https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/911018434804068352 …
As a bribe to Alaska, they get to KEEP Obama care. Why didn't you make that deal for NV? Just don't care or only want us to die? #DumpDean
U should be so proud of how u DO NOT stand up for the weakest amongst us.
Sen. Heartless Heller. Remembers when RNC wouldn't allow disabled children & their parents in the building DC this Summer.
Where are the CBO scores?
Dean Heller cares more about his donors than the healthcare needs of his constituents. Why because he is in it for the MONEY !
Heller voting yes to hurt millions will get to split the $400million Koch bribe with all the yes voters. Party over country for Greed!
Your constituent w/ stage 4 cancer:
President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 

Senater Heler, Why are you supportng Graham Cassidy Ins. prop. when you know that the bill will take away 3 million American PPls insurance?
How many of those hardworking airport employees will suffer because of your healthcare bill? You don’t know and don’t care. NV needs better.
300k so far. Screw Americans Healthcare. Right?

Price traveled by private plane at least 24 times http://politi.co/2ygIEof  via @politico
Except we need a few more accessible parking spaces. #onmywishlist
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy deathcare. It stinks on ice, and you know it
You're co-sponsoring a healthcare bill that will take away insurance from your constituents, so that you can give a tax break to the rich.
Voting for Heller would be like throwing your future out the window. 

#SaveACA
#NevadaNeedsNewLeadership
I think your challenger @RosenforNevada is super awesome. Rosen would be great for the people of Nevada & their medical security.

#Liberty
You wouldn't want to be one of the 243,000 Nevadans that will lose healthcare because of @SenDeanHeller #GrahamCassidy
Vegas & all the people of Nevada are organizing now to make sure you do not win reelection. 

It's time to stand up for the people of Nevada
If you don't #SaveACA #TheResistance will help build a #boycott of Vegas tourism & have you voted out. 
Be a leader & block this or buh bye.
Your casino buddies won't like that either!!!
THANK YOU everyone who's calling #DeanHeller to state their opinion on his sham of a "healthcare" bill. First time this week phones r busy.
Sad......This means more to you than your fellow Nevadans health.
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy death bill. Do something descent for once in your life.
Dean, how do you sleep at night knowing you'll be kicking people off healthcare...why don't YOU go home & hold a Town Hall next week #ACA 
Sen Heller u work 4 us.Stand up & vote NO 2 Trumpcare. Counting on u!! If not u will be voted out of office. We will make sure of that!
Dean, you are such a disappointment!  No on healthcare bill.
we know you don't care about Nevada, or u wouldn't have cosponsored #GrahamCassidy.
As you tweet nonsense your voters should know you lack smarts and courage. But redemption is possible if you vote against repeal.
Hopefully our access to health care will to. Vote NO on current bill
Since you are committing political suicide whether you vote yes or no. You may as well be a hero and do the right thing for Nevada.
Heller took money over his constituents! NEVER FORGET that he care nothing for you and your health! Only for his greedy ass self!
and under trumpcare they will have a lot fewer sick and dying people coming through.
Should be ashamed for pushing your so called healthcare bill. This is the worst bill yet! Vote out anyone who supports it.
Your so called Healthcare bill is the worst yet. You and everyone else pushing it should be voted out. Another tax break for 1%. Sad.
Check out @TheDailyShow’s Tweet:
“Let’s face it: America sucks at health care.” 
- @TheLewisBlack
http://on.cc.com/2yr5r1r  
How many won't be able to visit when their medical bills force them into bankruptcy? Honor your promise to @GovSandoval and vote no.
Please don't take away my healthcare
Your phone Box @ 202-224-6244 & office is closed? How's that? Please Do NOT Vote for Cassidy-Graham Bill! A Death sentence for States.
But don't expect to get healthcare here our Senator is voting to take healthcare away from thousands of his constituents we hate you HELLER
NO to TrumpCare @POTUS @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @billmaher @SenJohnMcCain @SenateGOP Lying crooks just want tax cuts for billionaires
That's our Dirty Dean...
NO!YOU & Nevada will be responsible for 1000s of DEATHS! VOTE NO ON C/G BILL! All Health Orgs, AARP, GOVS ARE OPPOSED! NO CBO = NO VOTE!
Your talking about customer service when you are about to serve up people's deaths with your healthcare bill? Shame on you!
At this point dean, you won't even win the primary against @DannyTarkanian - your loss will go down in the record books as the biggest upset
Too bad #TrumpCare will gut healthcare accessibility in Nevada.
To date you have been a real coward..You should consider a visit to LAS and actually meet with your constituency.
you have diddled Nevadans much more than TSA  congrats
just don't go there if you want healthcare you have a senator that doesn't believe in it
This is okay. Just remember Dean don't vote for that crazy Healthcare thing if you want to be reelected.


End food service monopoly or restrict 20%+ markup,stop mixing pedestrian and vehicle traffic,turn the volume down,lower landing fees!
Visit the state that you will destroy with your incompetent effort to craft a Healthcare bill. #voteoutdeanheller
Looking forward to fly in to help defeat you in 2018.
So your name is on the healthcare bill, but you're mum on Twitter? Trump really threatened you, didn't he? The power of cash. R u a coward?

Hello, @LindseyGrahamSC and @BillCassidy. Look long and hard at these pictures. This is my friend Jake. Without ACA he will die. 
Reject the new health bill
You are a sellout
Everyone who voted for the Trumpcare bill must be voted out of http://office.weather  it passes on not..i will have a list of yes votes..
#DeanHeller is co-sponsoring bill that punishes NV 4 expanding Medicaid. He DOESN'T stand 4 us. Traitor
New @KaiserFamFound report: Graham-Cassidy punishes Medicaid expansion states
http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/kaiser-report-graham-cassidy-repeal-obamacare … 
@RosenforNevada stands with you. Make sure to get that terrorist Heller OUT next year.
Please vote no on this health care bill. Americans deserve better. I urge you to reconsider your support.  Do the right thing.
YOU TOOL for Trump
Do we trust Repub senators who kowtow to their donors...or every major medical association? Ur bill is disgraceful
The ultimate question on Graham-Cassidy.

Feel free to share if it helps people. 
And to help with campaigns to throw you out of office.
Probably a lot of traffic these days of people leaving Nevada.
You should kill this bill based on its destruction of our children's healthcare alone... #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
So Republicans just want repeal and "consequences be damned" bec mega-donors are upset. What a disgrace
Why are senators readily considering a bill they think is bad policy and won't pass? @pkcapitol explains http://wapo.st/2fCLcGd 
ah yes, but tell me again how it's the Dem Party who's beholden to big donors 
When will you visit your constituents Dean?? We need to talk......................
We need town halls
Dean is afraid of us voters...all he does is have those fake teleconferences with planted questions and his bumbling Sophmoric answers..sad.
That's not really a reason to visit somewhere. But congrats I guess 
If parliamentarian strikes down waivers, then #DeanHeller's argument for state rights goes poof. Will he vote yes?
Health policy experts tell me Graham-Cassidy's waiver provisions might not survive Byrd Rule.

This creates a very interesting scenario: https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/910866424113061888 …
So is your resume ready because I r gonna lose your job in 2018 we can hardly wait to see u leave
Hey Dean, Nevadans and all people want full h/c coverage for all.  #SinglePayer #MedicareForAll #SocialismIsAGoodThing
It's telling that #DeanHeller cannot argue positively on merits of his bill. Nothing good about it
Report finds that every state would suffer under Trumpcare http://bit.ly/2xwCRxA  
Even healthcare industry is against your bill because it harms.  fed funding to states & raises premiums 4 sick.
New: Blue Cross Blue Shield @BCBSAssociation says they share the "significant concerns" healthcare orgs have about Graham-Cassidy: 
https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/GrahamCassidy.aspx …
But Sen. Heller wants to destroy the Affordable Care Act. 

You will lose in 2018.
By repealing indiv mand, #DeanHeller's "healthcare" bill guarantees prems 4 sick will . And bill cuts Med $. Shame
2/ Bill gives "option" to states to charge sick people more. But states will HAVE to take the option bc bill has no individual mandate.
VOTE NO please
He co sponcered the bill..only option is to vote out of office. He won't even talk to us..no balls
tour travel is good all friends.
Do not vote to take Nevadans' health coverage away. People will die! Read these comments to your stupid photo ops. We support fixing ACA 
The tool co sponcered it
Our biggest reason to visit Nevada next year is to help the people of Nevada make sure Dean Heller is voted out of office! #Resist #NoRepeal
Thank you for your help
Today would be a good day to investigate @SenDeanHeller.
