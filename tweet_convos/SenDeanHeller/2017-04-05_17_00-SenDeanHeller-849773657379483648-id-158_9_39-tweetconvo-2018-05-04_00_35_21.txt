Wish you would have been equally fair and vocal about Merrick Garland.
He Represents Republicans not Liberals please go to your rep. And bug her.
He should be representing what's in the best interest of all citizens. This party crap is the problem.
No, the Party crap is what Liberals have created. They are NOT Americans. They are Machiavellian Seditionists who want to destroy America
This is the root of the problem, an unwillingness to talk, work together, see the other viewpoint.
Your party has never worked with us. That's why there was civil war. Maybe it's time for another One! You Confederates never change.
The Dems and GOP switched platforms after the Civil War. Anyhoo, good day sir.
I wish you'd had a chance to vote on Garland.
He Represents Republicans not Liberals please go to your rep. And bug her.
No. He's supposed to represent the people of Nevada, regardless of party affiliation.
But....Nevada went blue. Regardless. I'm one of his constituents. I voted for him. But I was very disappointed by that stunt the GOP pulled.
Who cares what color Nevada is. You have your Liberal rep and this is the Republican rep.
Senators represent all Nevadans, regardless of how they voted, just as Pres. represents ALL Americans, regardless of how they voted. #civics
The other tries to represent US Americans. That's why you have one of each. One hates America the other pretends to serve it
Good, Gorsuch is the only choice!!! Only a Liberal Would chose not to, and they are too stupid to make good choices for dinner...
Ya'll see this shit. This fucking guy is the only dude supporting this decision. This type of conservatism is a cancer.
.@SenDeanHeller Apparently Dean Heller did not notice that Nevada has changed. Voting to confirm Gorsuch will ensure Heller's 2018 ouster.
ICYMI   I am not voting for you 2018
#Americans DO NOT want a #SCOTUS nominated by #POTUS under investigation for crimes against #USA. Why is #GOP putting party before citizens?
#epicfailure #betrayaloftrust  #midtermelections #voterswillremember
Nevada did not vote for Trump and does not support Gorsuch. "Overwhelming consensus" is a complete lie. #NoOnGorsuch #TimeForaRealTownHall
You shouldn't be voting for anyone who's not going to overturn Citizens United. PLEASE!
You're going down in 2018.
Because i blindly follow my party without even thinking about my constituents and I don"t want to be re-elected!. Tell the truth.
You need to listen to those of us that put you in the Senate. Don't get comfortable because you won't be reelected if you vote yes.
The people you represent  say VOTE NO
Then you will be replaced by us & the @justicedems
Party over country. Deplorable.
#2018VoteHellerOut
Absolutely. #2018votehellerout  Would love to get rid of Amodei too but not sure the demographics will work for that.
Agreed. I don't recall, but he might have even run unopposed??
Chip Evans ran against him & had no support whatsoever from the party, as far as I could tell.
Which is why we will not be voting for you. Hypocrite. You do not represent Nevada.
And now explain why you voted for nuclear option.  I'm raising money for you to run for dog catcher
Your "reason" show just how out of touch you are w/ reality & your constituents! "No such thing as D or R"?? This partisan hackery.
As if your reason is anything other than "I'm my party's bitch" I can wait to campaign for your opponent. Even if I don't like em..
Your opponent is my......nuclear option 
#2018VoteHellerOut
please be brave and vote as your constituents have asked you to do !  Vote NO
Thank you for setting the country back 100 years. 2018 can't come soon enough #votehellerout

You just follow party lines without a thought to what Neavadans want. You don't care about any of us and you don't care about Nevada
You are a disappointment every vote you choose to ignore your constituents voices, will be working toward removing you
Hope you lose your seat next year. You DO NOT represent Nevadans. Shame on you.
We don't really care what you want; you're supposed to vote for what we want. We being your constituents.
No explanation needed. You are nothing more than a yes vote for GOP party line. Thanks for voting for ISP's to sell our data btw.
#2018VoteHellerOut
You could have just said, "because I'm a GOP hack."

Pleased to work against your re-election in 2018.
Shame Shame Shame on You Dean Heller for this destroying the Senate. We voters will remember.
#2018VoteHellerOut
find out trump Russian collusion.
it,s a gop thing I,ll never understand????? say good bye senator!
#2018VoteHellerOut
FYI @SenCortezMasto posted just 14 min ago re: her Gorsuch opposition and has over 130 likes. You posted over 45 minutes ago and have 7.
It's not a popularity contest - it's what your people want.
Why I'm NOT VOTING FOR YOU IN 2018! Your voting for Gorsuch, you voted for the defeated ACA and you don't care about your constituents! #Bye
Republicans are thieves and have no conscience about theft. They are phony Christians who stole from MerrickGarland to #ConfirmGorsuch.
Because Trump told you to.
Thank you!
November 6, 2018. The clock is running out.
Let's see how that works for you in 2018!
#2018VoteHellerOut
Because you're bought and sold and soulless like the rest of the regime?
Please do not take away the majority, the "little guy's" voice. J. Gorsuch evaded questions--that's "failing" in any job interview, but--
His record speaks for itself. Pro Corprtns, Against Women's Personal Rights. He's wrong for us & your anti-democratic Nuclear move is too!
Because you follow ur corrupt GOP party blindly, thumbing your nose at constituents. You Damaged our political process. Youre SO done.
You have no ethics, no morals. You put party before country. Now Nevada will put Country before HELLER. Its time to go jag off cuz ur done
Explain why you just broke w/230 YEARS of history and violated our rules to force this POS down Americas throat? Power mad GOP went nuclear
You, sir, are a complete lackey.
@SenDeanHeller We will be voting you out at your next election. Shape up & Protect your states constituency, not your party, Or Ship Out!
You want to partner your career with this guy? Shame on you
This is who you're protecting
Refer back to this post when asking yourself "why was I voted out" in 2018.
But he didn't answer the questions that Democrats asked.  He avoided every controversial question.
bye dean. i can't wait to vote you out. you have no legislative accomplishments. you just blocked stuff. gorsuch will be your legacy.
Thank you, Senator Heller, from the grown-ups.
Bc the NRA bought your vote for $21k!
Again I ask you what the tally of calls to your office have been.  You do not deliberate, you just answer to the cash cows who donate to U.
I strongly oppose going nuclear for SCOTUS. Our democracy relies on checks and balances. Nuclear option destroys our democracy. Preserve it.
Because you vote along party lines and could care less about your constituents lives. You are such a disappointing representation of us
"Overwhelming consensus?" - what nonsense.  It was time to put Judge Garland on the Supreme court 1 year ago, Senator. - from 89423
Hope you enjoyed your time in office.
BE CLEAR.  The nuclear option is YOUR failure.  It is bc YOU've become so partisan and uncompromising.
I'm still waiting to see if there is just 1 republican who doesn't walk in step with corruption! Please let it be you!!!
The nuclear option will devastate the Court, the Senate, and democracy.  NO NUCLEAR OPTION!  Do the right thing for your constituents! #2018
A vote for Gorsuch is a vote for Corporations, not a vote for your constituency. And we will remember and know, we will vote!
So far all of a Trump's Cabinet is a disaster to their appointed office, Gorsuch will he the same. And you know it. Vote no!
#NoGorsuch  you will be voted out.
Please say no to Gorsuch! This vote will harm our democracy! It is a stolen seat and Gorsuch plagiarized his work.Notfit
The GOP obstruction to Senate rules and disgrace of the Constitution will not before gotten! DJT is under a FBI investigation
You never fail to vote against the voice of your constituents. Gorsuch will have a job for life, you will not have one for much longer.
Senator, why are you letting your self be lead by the extreme religious Right? History will not be kind to you! Or GOP!
I hope you have another career path in mind in 2018.
#StopGorsuch
Unbelievable that you can justify supporting this man's nomination despite what your constituents want.
Stolen seat nominated by a president that will be impeached. Your party is the worst. #Eviction2018 There is no excuse for your support.
thank you for doing the right thing so we can move on #trump2020
Heller you always vote the way your party tells you to vote. A judge should follow the constitution not a political party.
if you're looking to be out of office, voting for Gorsuch is the way to do it. U know damned well that seat belongs to dems.
Because you can't wait to get primaried?  Cool
Interestingly the phrase "I lick boots like it's nobody's business" does not appear in this article. #gorsuch
Your time is up in 2018. Thanks for knowing you're against us for corporations. You're a sell out
Even with the plagiarism that has come to light? No trump nominations, picks or anything else should be confirmed or do you love Russia too
I am disappointed that you continue to follow party line & are not listening to Nevada citizens.  No on Gorsuch until FBI investigation done
What will you do when your voted out.  Oh wait... nothing because you will get a retirement out of this world and free medical. Leach!
Dont change the rules to push him thru..he is not the right pick. He plagerized his writings
Your bosses (i.e. Nevadans) don't want this. You work for us; do your job and #ResistGorsuch. Or kiss your job goodbye in 2018.
#StopGorsuch
The last nail in your political coffin! #2018VoteHellerOut
you just don't get it. Garland was also fair honest objective jurist & didn't even get hearing. Reap what you sow.
#2018VoteHellerOut
Do not confirm Gorsuch.
I hope you support a 2/3 confirmation. #NoGorsuch #NoNuclearOption
#2018VoteHellerOut
Because you're a puppet.
https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/23/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-frozen-trucker-alphonse-maddin ….  Why you should be voting NO this week.  Stop voting yes on everything don puts forward
So principled.  Such a man of action.  Aren’t you the same guy who is afraid to stand in front of real NV constituents in a live town hall?
He lacks courage to step out of line.  He has been bought by doners.  He is afraid to face his constituents. #Trumprussia
Vote for him and kiss your office goodbye
#2018VoteHellerOut
Wow just 2 responses are positive. Maybe you should rethink this position
Please do the right thing. work to resolve the hard feelings caused by the Republicans refusal to vote on Merrick Garland. Vote no Gorsuch
#2018VoteHellerOut
No, you are voting to confirm because you are a pawn to this lying, hateful POTUS and in 2018 you will pay!
Noooooooo!  Taxes?  Russia?
You should think carefully before you vote to dump the requirement of 60 votes for SCOTUS.
And this is why I will not vote for you in 2018
Thank you!
ICYMI No one should be voting for this guy
#2018VoteHellerOut
#2018VoteHellerOut
#2018VoteHellerOut
Thank you
Sure wish you would listen to your constituents... that's what good senators do.
Don't vote 4 Gorsuch. DT is being investigated for Treason. How can you even consider a vote w/biggest crime in history
#2018VoteHellerOut
I will be so happy when we get to vote out Dean Heller of office.  He does not represent the best interest of Nevada.
#2018VoteHellerOut
You are a sheep. Baaaaaaaaaaaa!
Can't wait til you lose your seat.
He looks like he has a touch of downs, but speaks like it's full blown.
Thanks
I didn't miss it.  It doesn't make any additional sense the second time around.
History will judge you.
Ok. Degrade the Senate. Politicize the Court. Prepare for Justice Clinton & Justice Obama in a few years.
#2018VoteHellerOut
Disappointing.
#2018VoteHellerOut
because you are a PUPPET.  Will be voting AGAINST YOU.
ICYMI: This is why Nevadans are voting against Dean Heller in 2018:
Ur explanations fall flat. We obviously didn't watch the same hearings. GOP LACKEY & no integrity.  #StopGorsuch #Hellerout2018
Every time i see you, you have that stupidly indifferent smirk on your face. I can hardly wait to vote YOU OUT!
Because you hate women and workers? Who is paying you? Putin?
U all r idiots @BarackObama  written papers will be published which showed he was a racist against whites.
Because you prefer a nomination outsourced to private group & one that by-passes Senate input
weak sauce Deano. Weak sauce.
History will judge you.
Garland should have had a hearing.
