Dean please vote no to trump care. Stay strong for Nevadans and don't be intimidated by Trump. He cares only about himself. You care for us!
Our VA continues to give pathetic healthcare, and you know it
Do they still put names of dead vets on doctors' schedule to say they are busy?
If you can't stand up for our most vulnerable in NV then you have no business calling yourself a United Stated Senator! @GOP #KillTheBill
Stay strong, Senator. We see the pressure the WH and your fellow Republicans are putting on you. 

Thank you for your NO vote on Trumpcare.
Vote no on healthcare repeal if you are serious about supporting veterans and military families
I saw him threaten you
And now your going to vote to take their medicaid.  Come on and just be a transparent douche.
Do the right thing
Don't do it!!!
With millions losing healthcare- you are in hiding! Save the ACA
It was disgusting
dean heller is  sell out! He know exactly how Nevadans wanted him to oppose repeal of the ACA. Our recourse now is to vote that bastard out!
vote No on mcconnell's healthcare charade.  vets need medicaid & the ACA.
But you're okay with taking their healthcare away??  Please vote NO on the GOP healthcare plan. Do what is right for Americans.
How could you sit there next to him and allow him to threaten you on national television and laugh?? Where the hell is your dignity sir!!
Let's see if he has the balls to do the right thing on Aca or if he just another morally bankrupt r putting party politics above his people
I'm going to go with morally bankrupt. Tragically, he's more afraid of his peers and Citizens United than the people whom he represents.
That is great. Now our greatest worry is our adult kids working fulltime will not have healthcare if ACA is repealed. Country before politic
Dean will help people who have been hurt by Obamacare and can't even get it.
Thank you sir!
10% of American vets get healthcare via Medicaid.    

Trumpcare targets Medicaid for steep cuts.
Are you proud to take away health ijnsurance from thousands of your constituents in order to give rich people tax cuts?
No to robbing American veterans of healthcare! No to repeal and replace!
Senator Heller you are a good man! #MAGA
Vote no. It's simple.
When will u stand up to the bigoted policy from 45? Do u support this anti-American policy? Show some leadership @DeanHeller

@SenDeanHeller None of you are focused on reducing costs of HC? Pharma, Ins cos, hospitals all get a pass. Fx the problem. #VoteNo
Please vote NO on the health care repeal.  It's no good for the people of Nevada.
Vote complete ACA repeal as promised!
Aeterna Vigilia Pretium Libertas 
#Constitution #Liberty #COS #DitchMitch #ReplaceRyan #FullRepeal
Vote No today on the healthcare repeal.
#killthebill
If you care about veterans #VoteNoMTP. .5 million veterans will lose Medicaid coverage under #ORRA.
Vote no. Trumpcare will remove insurance from 20m to 30m people.

It is disgusting to see POTUS threaten you. The people elect you, not him.
Please vote no on health care motion today.  It could cause the death of thousands and no one is telling us what's in it first
Stand with American people and against putins puppets.
Thanks
Don't forget about the bill you're voting on to remember McClain's tumor would not have been found without a routine exam don't take it away
Stay strong and stay moral Senator - this is how we reach across the aisle - we are all Americans, and 20-30 million can't afford a NO vote
Awesome. Now please vote no tomorrow:
YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR BANK ACCOUNT B4 THE INTERESTS OF NV.  YOUR VOTE HAS BEEN BOUGHT OFF THRU SLUSH FUND $. UR A CRIMINAL
Let's see of @SenDeanHeller puts party politics above his own constituents
Thank you
Sen. Heller is under enough stress. He'll do the right thing, you'll see
Please don't waste your hard-earned credibility on a dishonorable man at expense of all of US. He'll turn on you w/out blinking (see AG). NO
Thank you! Now, Imagine what working together with healthcare professionals and your senate colleagues could do for healthcare-NO on repeal!

Capito, Heller, & others used to invoke needing to wait for a CBO score to justify wavering. Now going along with lack of a score—OR a bill. https://twitter.com/sangerkatz/status/889585434627645440 …

7- Getting your arm twisted and holding your grant und for your constituents is part of your job. It is the job.

https://twitter.com/rachaelmbade/status/889654497160699905 …
You vote tomorrow on this awful proposal. Your constituents hold your future in their hands... choose wisely or update your résumé! #help
@kmcbrd2  Good - now be proud to vote NO tomorrow on MTP on Healthcare. Vets are among those who will be hurt tremendously if ACA is gone.
Please vote NO tomorrow! The people of Nevada will remember your vote in 2018.

What Trump just did before the Boy Scouts of America encouraging them to Boo a former Boy Scout is what FILTH does. GOP OWNS this.
Not proud of you Sen. Heller! You failed Republicans for NOT fulfilling GOP's promise to repeal & replace Ovamitcare  Get behind Trump!!
HealthCare! Do your job and pass it
Great work on GI Bill! Will be forgotten immediately if you vote yes on the non-existent Trumpcare bill.
It's simple, Vote yes and lose your Senate seat.
You tweet about everything BUT what people are actually talking about!  Vote NO on proceeding.  You don't even know what is in the bill!
Sounds familiar 
PLEASE don't vote to advance #Trumpcare Senator Heller.  #TrumpcareKills
Please vote with your state citizens in mind, vote no on repealing ObamaCare. Please.
Do not take away health insurance from the people. I'm an RN for Obamacare.
Do not take away health care from millions!
Show you are stronger than Trump-don't let him intimate you Senator, vote NO on repealing the ACA!! TY
#VoteNo on MTP tomorrow.
Please tell me you aren't going to vote for the healthcare-removal bill that you have no info on...
McConnell plans a vote but won't give specifics. Is your party in a twilight zone? Lives are in the balance. The thugs are pushing. SAY NO.
Ovamit did not think about MANDATING young people to buy insurance; my premium increased tremendously: since when did need a socialist ACA?
Your inability to make a decision on healthcare is a disgrace. Do not Flip-FLop and accept bribes from Mitch.
On ur contact page your have 46 TOPICS for constituents to select- but you only talk about ONE! Stop hiding behind 1 and talk about the ACA
Please vote no tomorrow, Nevada and UMC are counting on you!!!!

these 28 groups took out a full-page @nytimes ad urging Senators to #VoteNO on #Obamacare repeal.

this is a moral – not a partisan – issue. 
Be a leader, not a sheep. Do not vote for something without the details. What's happening is scarring us. Please demand an open process!

Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you are fine w/ the #OCareNightmare! 
Remarks: http://45.wh.gov/Nn9Wsz  
#VoteNoTrumpcare don't take healthcare away from millions
REMINDER, ignore the rants of orange menace and serve NV by NOT VOTING to proceed.
Nevadans and the country need to know where you stand on the vote for MTP tomorrow. Vote NO - 2018 will not forget how you vote.

NO on trumpcare!


#Medicaid & #CHIP cover 44% of children w/special health needs due to conditions such as autism, spina bifida & more http://kaiserf.am/2ur56vu  
Please continue to be a leader with #Wealthcare; standing up to @SenateMajLdr and other GOP.  We thank you for your leadership thus far.

It is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with a vote on Tuesday. 
Please vote no on Trump care, Senator! Please, have a voice for us in Nevada!
don't be #complicit with the WH & your GOP colleagues...don't allow Trump to bully you...vote NO on repeal...improve the ACA...don't be Ryan
Please VOTE NO on repealing the ACA.
Against thug tactics of rudderless @WhiteHouse, with no ideas or leadership. NV vets will remember your courage today, in 2018 Primaries! 2/
Sen Heller, GOP leadership "strategy" for mystery vote tomorrow on BCRA/ACA repeal is crazy! 2 important!  GOP vets in NV stand with you 1/
Isn't that touching? While my wife's Health Ins.Premium 330 to $1,000. I can't afford 4 me. Keep your word to Tax Payer!

Wow. Catholic nuns: this is the "most harmful legislation for American families in our lifetimes"; it is "simply immoral" and not pro-life. 

Tomorrow we are being asked to choose between Donald Trump and our constituents. It is that simple.


@SenDeanHeller Please, we are begging- this Bill kills. Not hyperbole. Please have courage, have history look kindly
This. Because the @WhiteHouse for political agenda, would rather hurt the poor, disabled, children, and elderly- than fix #ACA for all. 
#FullRepeal #NoReplacement #FreeMarket #defundpp #UnitedForFreedom
lil errand boy u ready to be retired?
You were hired to work for Nevada and we need ACA. Repair it.

Pouring rain will not stop the #ADAPTandResist campout to #SaveMedicaid at 1st/Constitution NW at Senate buildings. #ProtectOurCare 
All of us will be more proud once you vote no on BCRA. #hellervoteno #LetUsLive
A signed repeal followed with and contradicted by a broken promise equals very negative attention. #FullRepeal of the ACA  #UnitedForFreedom
https://mobile.twitter.com/AbeMartin7/status/888786666093240320 …
The overwhelming position here is VOTE NO.  #ImpeachTrumpNow
YOU appear to be a RINO! NO trumpcare! #REPEALObamacare completely as PROMISED! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
Only 17% support any of the current health care bills currently being considered in Congress.  PLEASE vote NO

And yet just as proud to support a healthcare bill that strips benefits from millions? @AARP
You're a total fraud if you don't vote for #FullRepeal like you did in 2015. 
#FreeMarketSolutions
#UnitedForFreedom
#DoYourJob!!
100% agree! For 7 years Republicans did not stand against Ovamit. Campaigned to repeal & replace Ovamitcare. I VOTED FOR YOU!
Do your job!!
Great leaders earn buy-in. Don't force an awful unpopular #Wealthcare bill down our throats. The majority of real Americans don't want this.
Let us know where you stand on healthcare? Millions will die if you don't step up to the plate and do the right thing. #HistoryisWatching

3- Let's look at Nevada. @DeanHeller. Can someone who makes $13,000 in your state afford to spend >1/2 their income on care?…
Senator, vote no on a healthcare bill that is hidden and will harm this Country. Please state your position!  Please VOTE NO!
Please lobby for a bipartisan effort to fix ACA. To vote for a bettercare plan, which is neither better nor care, or repeal spells disaster
Single-Payer Medicare 4 All or Universal Health Care (UHC) is inevitable. Let's fine tune the details and move forward.
The @GOP put out a bill that cuts Medicaid after the thug @POTUS said non-stop on campaign trail no cuts to Medicaid!  All GOP are liars!!
How about a NO vote on Trumpcare?  Are you going to take healthcare away from millions while keeping it for yourself?
just say no to #repealandrun #repealandreplace start working with your Dem colleagues and shore up the ACA.
When will you actually stand up for our country? When ? R's and D's will remember what you did Not do to protect our country and democracy!
Are u voting on a bill that almost no one knows what is in it? No hearings no input from professionals?No public input? Is that America?
Vote to repeal aca,we need free markets,ppl can't afford aca
To GOP Senators: Taxpayers should repeal your salary/benefits/perks for 2 yrs. We will then let u know what u will get. Deal?  Fix ACA!
@SenDeanHeller sendeanPlease don't hurt us! Please listen -
@GOP reasoning to "Repeal & Replace"- We ran on it. 
According to Fox Poll, 74% of USA wants bipartisan #ACA fix.
@SenateGOP LISTEN TO US!
Do not give in to special interest groups who don't even vote for you !
Keep in mind: there are nearly 2M Vets on Medicaid, that the BCRA cuts by $700B. Trump promised no cuts to Medicaid.
The Republicans who want to cut SS & Medicaid are wrong. A robust economy will Make America Great Again! https://www.donaldjtrump.com/ 
Senator. As an RN x35 years I ask you stand your ground and vote no to repeal of ACA. Saving Medicaid, Medicare, SS saves lives!
RNs will never remove a viable humans life support. If you repeal the ACA then will YOU remove their life support, or see them grow?
I am teaching Sunday School tomorrow.  Is a time of Israel's highest corruption.  You will be an example of government forgetting the people
You have no idea the level of anger that exists to see you leave DC.  There is no way you can win after your stand on Obamacare.
See you, with towel in hand, in November next year. How can a man in our Senate have the obviously low IQ you have
You are working on the wrong issue and I have to say you need to go in 2018
Where are you on health care?

Stand your ground @SenDeanHeller, work with Dems to improve, not destroy, health care for ALL Americans
This is how democracy dies.
8- There are rumors about virtually every R Senator being lured to vote yes on MTP.

Do not be comforted by statements until the vote.



I’m not going to stop sharing these health care stories until the Republican health care bill is officially defeated. 

While millions and millions of Americans suffer no jobs, 1k per month Health Ins. Premiums. While you play games.
Here's a message to you, Senator...
 https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1628808957150588/ …

Two words to @SenateGOP when @realDonaldTrump says “I'll have your back" when you vote to repeal health care: Jeff Sessions.
Nevadans are trusting you to VOTE NO ON HC! 2018 will be here soon! trump and your unhappy constituents will make sure we have a new senator
I'M calling Hellers (nv) DC office all morning . They hang up as soon as !call is connected!! Call Email Tweet! Heller promised a NO VOTE
Thank you so much for taking care of our veterans and military families!
THanks for not supporting TrumpCare, but you DO realize that if you impose an age tax, The People will #getcha, right? AARP is watching YOU.
Don't let DT intimidate you. Most of America wants to save ACA. Some didn't understand What it was.
How about introducing a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.
@Lawrence Is @realDonaldTrump Hotel Las Vegas Violating ADA Laws for Refusing Disabled Couple Segway Use in his @POTUS For Profit Hotel?
We need ACA..fix it. We need Mueller..Support him. We don't deserve Trump and corrupt GOP...fight back. He can't fire you. We'll decide that
you better not vote fotr #Trumpcare, you're done and I'm moving back to Ca

Don't be a fool!

Grow a spine. Quit chumming/yucking it up with the conman-in-chief and fight for the people of NV to keep healthcare.
Why do you and the rest of the @GOP hate the poor, disabled and elderly so much that you would make healthcare unaffordable!!?? Disgusting!
Think about it: @SenDeanHeller's legacy could be saving hundreds of thousand of lives, not letting #Turmp bully him into submission.
Or, could be remembered as the guy who lets #Trump embarrass him to submit to their will, let 200,000 people die, ruin lives of #Disabled.
Intimidation, just like in North Korea.  Stay strong Heller.
If you don"t vote NO I will do everything in my power to make sure you lose in 2018!  NO on health care repeal.
Stay strong Senator Heller & protect the people of Nevada. Do not bow to #FakePresident TRUMP.  STAY STRONG FOR NEVADA
No Repeal...No Re-Election, Liars never prosper...no matter how many babies you kiss or Vets you take pictures with.
I live in Vegas we produced d most evil senator, Dirty Harry. We voted for Heller to support Trump's agenda. Vote YES. U owe us!!
#doyourjob
Be on the right side of history.  @POTUS isn't going to control you.
Did you run for office that you were for repealing #Obamacare?
Don't let Trump bully you, country over party, don't throw millions off their health insurance
Vote NO, trump was wrong to use you in front of video cameras
Oh you love veterans...aren't you a great leader.
Thanks in advance ..stay strong!!
I think we need a new senator
Repeal Ocare disaster or 2018 isn't going to be good.. 
We may not sit home and tweet all day, but we sure as hell outnumber the other side!
Obama care benefits veterans.
Vote NO on repeal or replacement of the ACA.
#TrumpCare out-of-pocket costs/deductibles are unaffordable. Vot no
Under BCRA, people losing Medicaid need to spend *at least* 60% of income on deductible before insurance kicks in. https://www.manatt.com/Insights/Newsletters/Medicaid-Update/Can-People-Losing-Medicaid-Under-BCRA-Afford-Marke … 
Did not find Trump's "humorous" threat to your job funny at all. You have been voted in to represent the people, not be his bud. Stay strong
VOTE NOOOO ON REPEAL & REPLACE!!!!!!!!

CBO estimate of the ACA deductible for someone making $26,500 in 2026: $800

Under the BCRA: $13,000, a 1525% increase.

To be clear, this is a design feature of the Senate health bill, not a CBO projection based on uncertain assumptions. https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/888081799821180928 …
I'll be proud to send your carpet-bagger-asw back to California in about a year. DEAN HELLER IS A PIG
Senator! Senior Nevadans need your support! #VoteNo on this disaster patchwork of Legislation.
