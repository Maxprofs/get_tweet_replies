I guess you're just going to go tell way of political suicide then. Mmkay. #VoteHimOut

Have you no shame sir!!! Introducing Moronic Devos to them was an insult to higher education!!
.@SenDeanHeller I shall donate to the campaign of your opponent in the 2018 race for your Senate seat because you voted to confirm DeVos.
, @BetsyDeVos is a disgrace to America! #DumpDeVos #NotMySOE
SHE'S NEVER TAUGHT BEFORE!!!!
How pathetic.  You truly stand alone Senator.  U R senior NV Senator.  Vote no on her nomination.
I guess you really want to keep young Nevadans uneducated. Shame on you.
Of course he does. Only an uneducated person will ever vote for him or his ilk again.
True, sadly there's so many of them.  Look what a POS got elected president
PLEASE give careful consideration to Ms DeVos' lack of qualifications.Our children deserve better
listen to your constituents, we are watching every vote #2018
He won't, time to boot him out of office !

She'll destroy public education. Vote no.
And ppl wonder why NV is last in education?

Please, for the kidâ€™s sake - vote NO, then RESIGN.
Yep..local, state, & fed...none give 2 shits. Just want money.
Good job in putting #partybeforepeople.
Dean Heller bought & paid for. Hates NV children by supporting incompetent plagiarist Betsy DeVos.
.@SenDeanHeller @unlv @usedgov @BetsyDeVos Keep voting for Trump's nominees, and you won't have this job in 2018. (no Governorship either!).
Enjoy that office while you can. It's short lived.
DeVos has no relevant  qualifications outside of giving the GOP millions.  Our children deserve better.
You should all be ashamed!
She's not qualified. You know this. Her & her family's donations are equivalent to pay to play.
NO on DeVos! Get serious and do not settle or make a deal on this one. Your children & state deserve better.
just a terrible choice for education secretary.  Kids deserve WAY BETTER!
shame On you for supporting Betsy Devos. Name 1 way she will improve the education system she'll sell it

DeVos does not have the background, knowledge, or skills to improve higher education. #opposeDeVos
No on DeVos. Shame on you for even considering such an unqualified person.
Do you read responses to your tweets? Vote NO like EVERYONE is asking!

Your voicemail is full at the Las Vegas office, my husband @kjmedina called to tell you to vote NO on @BetsyDeVos
did she inquire about public schools, because she knows nothing about them. Are you really in support of her??
Heller is worthless and will be replaced with some who listens to constituents
vote no to Devos #nodevosfornevada no to Sessions also
Disgraceful. She is unqualified and not an advocate for public education. You'll be voted out in 2018. Prepare for that.
Look at you yucking it up with DeVos.  I'll remember this in 2018.
Your constituents oppose the nomination of @BetsyDeVos You have lost our trust and our votes
12 senators betrayed our children by confirming incompetent plagiarist Betsy DeVos. Will yours???
We are watching you. Horrible Choice!! Totally unqualified! Plagiarizer!
she's an absolutely horrible person.
Start acting like a real senator for a change, please.
Hope you're aware of who won Nevada last year -- hint it wasn't your Dear Leader.
It is pretty obvious that the people you work for clearly want you to oppose her. #nobetsydevos

Betsy compliments Dr Oh on being "Asian" "you people are so smart!" @SenDeanHeller agrees. She's a pip.

DeVos is a no-brainer. LITERALLY.
as someone in higher education I ask that you keep twits like her away.
this should be a no-brainer NO vote regardless of partisan politics. She is absurdly unqualified.
Did u notice that you are getting nothing but opposition here? 2018 can't come soon enough...
Does this mean you are a yes vote on one of the most unqualified cabinet appointees ever? #NoDevos
Do you have shotguns at the ready in case of grizzlies?
Vote NO on this unqualified nom.
Vote NO on DeVos.  Put our kid over Party.

Vote NO! It's the only option at this point. Our children deserve better!
"Hi, nice to meet you. I have no idea how public schools and scholarships work!"
Former Miss Teen South Carolina is more qualified than @BetsyDeVos -
she will not uphold our laws b/c she is clueless on IDEA- #VoteNoDevos
Was there a convention in town for nitwit right-wing ideologues?
Trump is a fraud and he and his family are running a racket at the expense of our nation.
