Pro tip - vote no on ACA, and switch parties to avoid the primary. This is the time to be bold if you want to save career.
Please please please put people above party politics and #hellervoteno ! You're constits lives are on the line!
Stay strong, do not cave, do the right thing.
If the states control health care each states coverage and Medicaid would be different. Texas has already stated that they will have bare...
policies that are affordable. She would not be able to afford the coverage that she needs to care for herself. She is alone no family there.
Please vote NO to repeal our healthcare!! Please consider people before party. Thank you for supporting all Americans!!!!
So, is it true Senator Heller? Can you be "bought off"? I'm sure your constituents would like to know.
Please please please vote No!!!
Please please please please vote No!!!
She does not have medical coverage other than Medicaid. She can't have a job. Texas would not provide the coverage that she needs.
PLEASE @SenDeanHeller DO NOT FLIP. People with serious illness want to stay alive and stay able. Remember us.  #ProtectPatientsNow
How does a constituent get invited to the exclusive events? Where are the transcripts? Transparency? Post on social media & engage
I think you must need to win some sort of Golden Ticket to get invited. He's not doing himself any favors by keeping people out.
#HellerVoteNo
If States control Health Care then some states will not have proper health coverage. My Aunt in Texas is dealing with Aneurysms of the brain
#HellerVoteNo
If you really care about the ppl of NV you'll vote to repeal and return the free market. Medicare& Medicaid is enough socialism.
Free market would close ERs to poor & uninsured. Would deny care to poor, old & sick. Would kill rural clinics & hospitals. NOT good for NV.
That is not true at all. Stop listening to gov healthcare propaganda.
Do u know what "free market" means? In a true free market ERs could deny poor & uninsured & insur co.s could deny insur. to old & sick.
No they cannot more leftist propaganda. Wake up.
We know you're going to make a deal on healthcare with Mitch and sell us out. Shameful and morally bankrupt!
Brown nose. Stay out of McConnell trump butts
Please vote NO & work with the Dems to fix ACA!!!
Vote NO #Trumpcare
Don't throw the people in Nevada that have Medicaid under the bus -their lives matter!
Senator Heller, my family lives in Reno. They need the healthcare they have with Obamacare. Desperately. Please don't destroy us.
Secret townhall meetings and no transparency! @DeanHeller
Hope you vote no on McConnell's travesty "wealth"care plan.  Let's be honest, it's all about tax breaks for you rich folks. Not our lives!!
say no to trumpcare
to pay her health care costs. She has had to have 6 surgeries on her brain. 3 on both sides. She is still dealing with bleeding on the brain
Don't let WE THE PEOPLE down. Live up to YOUR WORDS, your beliefs, VOTE NO on trumpcare aka PUTINCARE
I would move there to help her but I too am disabled as well as my husband. We would not be able to afford proper care in TX either.
Save the ACA and strengthen it. Don't hook your fortunes to #TreasonousTrump because we won't forget that
Please vote no on TrumpCare so Nevadans don't die.  Do what's right for NV, not party.  Also, schedule a real town hall in Las Vegas 
I voted for you and will continue to support you please get rid of Obamacare and get government out of our healthcare.  Please defund PP.
Thanks for the invite.  You are stand up by taking calls from all including those who didn't and won't vote for you.  Obamacare needs to go

.@sendeanheller, 58,078 Nevadans would see their deductibles rise from $1,432 to $6,000â€”a 319% increase. Vote no. https://shar.es/1TnHAx 
Here's some feedback from a WC constituent.  
1. Save Net Neutrality
2. Save ACA and vote #NoAHCA
3. Dump Trump Publicly
Is there recording of this? I'm interested in what topics were discussed. Who should I contact for next audio only briefing? WH is scared 2!
Hope the said repeal only
Please help to repeal & replace Obamacare.
Please get rid of Obamacare it's a disaster.
No tax cuts for billionaires
Why can't we get pre-noticed on these meetings?  So frustrating!!
Change your political party to Democrat, turncoat!
I'm a constituent and live in Washoe County, how did I not hear about it? I would love to attend next time. How does one get in the list?
Vote no on the new GOP healthcare bill!
Yet still not an in person town hall? Your constituents have been asking. Why are you avoiding it? You are aware you represent us, right?
I guess u havnt figured out that even if you win the rest of the state, you can't win without support from Clark county
Please hang tough don't let them  buy u out stand firm
So you're having a hard time at your town halls?
Is it your constituents complaining or the Democrats?
Who will vote for you... maybe.
When are you coming to #Vegas? I'd love to know....  you can either keep ur word w/ @GovSandoval n #NoVote and be the #Hero! Or lose in 18!?
Support President TRUMP
Sorry I missed it. Was at Renown all day, grateful that Medicare will pay 80% of my transfusions, worried that others are not so fortunate
And did u listen?
Why aren't you doing in person town halls? You've voted to send our military to war, yet you're apparently afraid of your own constituents.
Another one to which I was not invited! Stop bragging about holding "town halls."  These are middle school "mean girl" parties.
"Telephone Town Hall?" COWARD!
Waited on the phone for an hour. Good questions asked. I left a VM really hope I get an answer. Thank you.
Be moral & kind by voting no on any repeal of ACA and current Trumpcare bill. Basically you should just work to improve coverage/costs ACA.
Is there any honest and moral people left in the W H? Pretty sad when the person in charge of ethics quits. No ethics in Washington. You too
Did they happen to mention that they want you to stand against an obviously corrupt group of people that have been kidnappinng our govt?
How about the constituents of Clark County!
To insure you are NOT reelected. We are legal citizens to vote. You are nothing but corrupt.
. Mistake voting for you. We Repub and indies voted for you. Majority rules. Now you act like a Dem. I will work with others
This is a bot account. Recc all to block.
Glad you're against Trumpcare, but why no real town halls? Kind of like the audio-only WH press conferences. Don't be such a coward.
National heroes will emerge from the Republican party - they are the ones who will stand up for protecting the vulnerable. Please vote no.
What is wrong with all your constiuwnts in Clark County?
What did you say about #Trumpcare?  Where can I see the video or transcript?  Please vote no!
I hope they told U 2 stand behind your promises 2 get rid of Ocare! U better help pass t new HCBill! That's what we want& what U promised!!
Please inform yourself. The new bill will be disastrous NV, it would throw hundreds of thousands off health care & end up killing people
Explain to @SenCoryGardner what a town hall is. #KILLTHEBILL
When are you going to hold a real live town hall in vegas
A NO VOTE ON HEALTH BILL & IFNFOUND GUILTY OF COLLUSION, IMPEACH!!!!!
Keep 'em happy!
Spend their money wisely... offer help to those who can't help themselves.
Watch out for those who will scam the govt.
You know this bill will kill THOUSANDS of your constituents. Stay Strong we need you to VOTE NO. PLEASE DON'T DISAPPOINT NEVADA. THANK YOU
Let's get the HealthCareBill passed in the Senate!
How come you're against the best interests of the people of NV? New bill will throw hundreds of thousands off health insurance & kill people
I am for bringing HealthCareBill to all 50 States since Obama Care is not standing the test of time we need something better.
And knocking hundreds of thousands of Nevadans off of Medicaid like myself is something better?
Not sure what you're saying. Want to maintain Medicaid expansion it helps so many desperate and needy people
If dipshitcheetocare were to pass, hundreds of thousands of people would eventually lose their Medicaid if there is a lifetime cap put in
We need a senator who will stand up to the admin. This stuff is getting crazy and Nevadans did not vote for @realDonaldTrump #RussiaGate
Tele-town halls are an insult. Show up in person; your summer recess has been extended. You have no excuse. Face your constituents.
He's afraid because he did vote to repeal only.
When are we getting a statement about possible collusion or treason?
I'm proud to live in Nevada where our Republican Senator is his own MAN!
Thank you Senator for backing us.  Keep your distance from the insanity.
Be strong please. Your party is looking pretty sad right now. You and more like you that will fight for the people can make it better.
NO TO TRUMPCARE, NO TAX CUTS, NO TRUMP AGENDA! Does the R after your name mean Russian? $$$ from Ukraine in McConnell's pockets!
Proud that you are not succumbing to the pressure.  Trumpcare is bad for Nevadans and just plain cruel.
Heller be the man Stand up for our Nation u have proven to be a strong voice for your state please Stand up for our Country it is in trouble
We're ya thinking about coming to Las Vegas soon Senator?
You're a rock star Mr. Heller!
How do we get transcripts of these meetings? We want to know what people asked and how you replied. Stop hiding from Nevadans.
ADVANCE NOTICE. Hey @DeanHeller, if you don't want to represent all of Nevada, quit. You need to call for #IndependentInvestigation @POTUS
I bet they had no idea it was coming, how to submit questions, or when the next one will be. Your office seems to be so secretive. Why?
How nice of you!  Why are you hiding from us in southern NV?  Something to hide? Sen your days are numbered. Can't fence sit. Get real!
Acting like Trump don't you think? Seems the whole Rep. party sneaky and quiet. Sounds like he"s getting ready to screw us.
We listened tonight. Great, informed callers. Urge you to maintain ur current "no" on BCRA. It leaves far too many without healthcare
What's so special about you. How did you find out about the telephone Town Hall please tell us the secret
I honestly have no idea other than we still have a land line I picked up when caller ID said US Congress. Call was in progress
Interesting government business conducted in complete secrecy, not the Democracy I believe in. Are you a Republican by any chance?
Haha- no im a life long demo and have never voted for Heller. This was definitely unexpected. I will tell you the ppl who were able to  /1
I am so pleased that you put your constituents before party. Please remember to keep doing just that. And you will have my family's vote

This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
Hey Dean...come on down to Vegas...we'd love to speak with you about the ACA and comrade Trumpsky...
Hope you are a solid no. Kudos for listening. More than @SpeakerRyan is doing!
Why telephone? I'm in Washoe County and want to make sure you live up to your word to vote no on McConnell nightmare "health care" bill.
Please stay strong. Hold McConnell's feet to the fire. And hold #45 accountable.
Unfortunately.
Vote no!  Your constituents and the vulnerable people of America are counting on you.   #killthebill
Thank you for caring. vote against this healthcare bill. It will hurt us. Work with the entire senate.
He did vote to repeal only.

Your tele-townhalls are a joke.  Pre-screened and impossible to know about until they are over.  Why are you so scared?
We'd like in person Town Hall in Henderson-Las Vegas please.
He got elected by Washoe, he's hoping for a repeat.
That might change...
Thank you for supporting your constituents. Keep up the good work and stand up for what's right! Peace be with you Senator Heller!
That's funny I'm a constituent and you have never replied to me.
For the 100th time, we'd love to have you stop hiding from Southern Nevada, and hold an in-person town hall in Vegas. Come down & chat!
Life long republican not voting for you.  I voted against Heck too, we know how that turned out.
Last chance to stop single payor in America!  @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRonJohnson @SenTedCruz @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @SenateMajLdr
Bro, it's "single payer" not "payor"  and that is what Americans and Nevadans want. If it's good enough for Congress it's great for us!
Please say something of what constituents expressed. You need to communicate better.
When are you doing an in-person town hall in Las Vegas?
When are U having an in-person town hall in Las Vegas?
We would love to hear what you have to say....seriously!
Retweet to Las Vegans!
