Mnuchin - are you making sure you and spouse (Marie A) get tax breaks to help her shop with you?  Where is check for her trip to see gold?
Senator-no spine-you lose primary or General-so do what is right-withdraw GC -am sure your buddy loves it- as good as foreclosing old ladies
Mnuchin-stop lying-stop spending taxpayer$to fly-stop refusing to criticize DJT-remember he condoned antiSemitic behavior-what about Nazis?

The Foreclosure King tells us what's good for the people? Please excuse me if I don't believe a f***in thing you say. #GreatAmericanRobbery
Awesome! Did Louise come along for a free trip and some poor-shaming of the citizens who pay their taxes so she could watch the eclipse?
Oh sorry! I hope I didn't interrupt you foreclosing on a granny over a 27 cent mistake. If so, my bad!
Enjoying public "service" Steve?
Can you get a sequel to the movie "The Big Short" about the biggest theft in US history with the theft of FNMA & FMCC going? Would be great!
Wow, timing.  I just watched that again last night..
So you would rather keep a slave owner on the $20 instead of Harriet Tubman a black women who brought my enslaved ancestors to safety?

...of your people, how can you begin to convey the moral strength necessary for REAL tax reform!?  Cowardice pervades you.
If you don't have the courage to stand up to those who ambiguously side with Nazis, you know, the mentality that killed millions...
By tax reform, you mean increasing your wealth and that of your friends right? Your wife needs her Hermes bags right?  #GreedyMunchkin
It's a scam people. Tax cuts for the rich on the backs of poor people.  https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/august-recess-toolkit-tax-reform/ …
The most important thing you will ever do in your life is invoke the #25thamendment and remove the dangerous sociopath from the @WhiteHouse.
I just learned what Shanda means........When you look in the mirror what do you see? #disgust
"Tax reform" = code for tax cuts for the billionaires like Mnuchin and most of Trump's cabinet.
Stand a little closer to that guy that was known as the "Foreclosure King" during the housing crisis. You know, the one that hit NV hardest.
When did this country become all about what the gov't will do for me?  Oh yeah - 8 years of Obama.  Tax cuts for those who pay taxes.  Duh.
Have you wrote that check yet? For your wife's transgressions?

If it's important, I'm confused why you and Admin aren't putting forward a clear proposal about what "reform" means. Step up!
Git-r-done!!
Wouldn't it be better to eliminate the corrupt IRS entirely and start over with a more fair system?
