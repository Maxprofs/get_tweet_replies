What's Santorum doing there? He's irrelevant. You will be too, Dean
You're not irrelevant if your blue collar issues & polices won Trump the election & you're the architect of the end of Obamacare #relevant
Trump is a Corporatist, so is Santorum, so is Heller
Santorum is a true blue collar guy. He literally wrote the book Trump used to win. Served 16 yrs in office in a blue state as a conservative
No. Santorum is crazy, and a sellout
https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ ….  How is this a good thing??
If Rick Santorum likes it I KNOW it will hurt most Americans and be a boon to insurance cos and big  pharma.  SHAME!!
Reprehensible
Are you purposely trying to get your state to hate you so you won't get reelected? If so you're doing a great job!
disgusting move.  you should all be ashamed of yourselves.  You care nothing about your constituents.
Shame.
Fly by the seat of your pants on Healthcare for Americans? No Thank you! #SaveACA
This is not better than ACA.  Shame on you.  Gutting the health care of the most vulnerable, while cutting the taxes of the wealthy.  Shame.

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
#GOPShame!
Evil is as evil does.
Here is a summary of the BS policy @SenDeanHeller #WorkingHardAgainstNevadansDaily
Why are you supporting a bill that would cut Medicaid and Medicaid expansion?  Don't be fixated on "repeal and replace" but work to fix  the ACA and fine tune this health plan that helps so many millions of our fellow US citizens.
Dean, 
Reconsider Graham/Cassidy which HURTS AMERICANS. YOUR TIE to a Grand Jury bound Potus &  from your own voters when their CARE TANKS

A despicable attack on children with heart disease...SHAME! @CHC_Nevada
Nowhere in this press release does this say people get affordable  health insurance.  NOWHERE
Bye bye.  Good luck in your next job.
Will not be voting for you!
It's a terrible proposal. Why not just work with the Democrats to fix and amend ACA? It's already better than anything coming out of the GOP
I don't bother with you any more. Lost cause. Going to the next level.
Sen Heller so glad your name on this bill that allows ins execs to charge higher rates for seriously ill children. Now you can't deny it
You got nuthin' so resign.
You can do with a way with our health care when you do away with your healthcare. Hopefully it'll end next year after we vote
@LindseyGrahamSC  this new healthcare bill stinks! Get ready to loose your job.
@LindseyGrahamSC YOU are creating a disaster with this new bill.
It's just plain evil
Wish you would all put the MIDDLE CLASS and lower-income ahead of wealthy and NOT pass this bill! Fix #ACA, don't ruin #Medicaid! #AARP @CNN
In 8 years then what!
Your plan SUCKS! And you are a LIAR!
It is AWFUL
Hopefully you notice 99% of the people of Nevada are against this newest mess. No aligning yourself with another "genius" in Santorum? OMG
SHAME, SHAME, SHAME
Whose a$$ are u kissing now?

Your missing your hood Heller

Explain how U all sleep at night knowing you are voting to Kill americans?? Is Russian Collusion not enough? ALL of u will be voted OUT
This is an #ACA repeal bill that takes away critical protections, gives all power to the states and makes coverage discretionary. Try again.
What the hell was Santorum doing there???
So you are cosponsoring a bill that does exactly what you said you wouldn't support.
Nice.
You can't stop trying to take health care from People!
What does Rick Santorum have to do with the Senate?  People in Nevada don't buy your bullshit Dean. Your idea is a joke
2018 TIC TOC

Your bill cuts federal funding for NV by hundreds of millions.. shame on you for lying & saying you will protect us
NEW: Graham-Cassidy's federal funding cuts BY STATE in 2026 (in millions)

Kind of thick aren't you?
Look at you up there - w/ your lifetime benefits, your retirement accounts all set...not a care in the world while you strip the rest of us.
Heller's a spineless weasel more interested in Steve Wynns pay off than his own constituents. Vote him out! Vote for Jacky @RosenforNevada
This needs to go down in bitter defeat or - better yet - never get a hearing. Let bipartisan fixes go forward instead. #HellerNo
Will not back anything that you support because you've already proved yourself unreliable and a liar
#DeanHeller should know better than to compare something necessary to save life without bankrupting you to a luxury
.@SenDeanHeller compares healthcare to iPhones, says under his repeal bill you can keep your iPhone 7 if you like it or buy a better iPhoneX
Your plan makes it easier for insurance companies to offer plans with drastically reduced services. How can you sleep at night?
I'm gonna release you from your job.
.u voted against healthcare 4 Americans 2little2late #nosenate4uin18
Let's say for a second this plan is good. The gov today threatens pulling grants from states on separate issues it doesn't like. Comment?
Also, what's to prevent states from raiding grants for non related health care issues? Ala social security et al. Comments?
Why have you not removed state lines. In my honest opinion this is another government grab allowing States to dictate to individuals
What's best for Nevada, and America, is #Medicare4All .
Why does the phrase "closing the barn door after the horse got out" come to mind?
B/C THEY KNOW THE EXECUTIONER IS COMING AT ELECTION TIME AND THEY WILL BE OUT OF A JOB.  DEANY'S POLITICAL FATE IS SEALED--HE'S VOTED OUT
@SenDeanHeller You lied about #healthcare cuts. Now the #voters of #Nevada make sure you join the #unemployed. #Trump puppet #LasVegas #Nv
Dude...time to do what is best for NV and everyone else...get on board with @SenSanders proposal.  #MedicareForAll is what makes sense
Disgraceful & ensures that you will lose your bid for reelection in '18. You promised constituents to protect M'caid. This plan guts it.
You have zero integrity. You are everything that's wrong with politics. Shame on you.
Why do so many people want things for free?      This proposal appears to be a great compromise.
You all have let us all down not working with the president since day one. You have had years and we see the swamp is all over paul Ryan.
Rick Santorum  
Only way to get decent healthcare is to #VoteHellerOut #Medicare4All #TheResistance Heller is a liar just like tRump #ShameOnYou
Here is the newest iteration of how we are going to screw over thousands of nevadans so we can give tax cuts to the super rich! We have eyes
Weak
How effing hard is it to have #MedicareForAll. Oh ya.. the part where the ins companies can't pay you off! My bad. Can't wait till your GONE
In June, Heller said he wouldn't vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid & Medicaid expansion. Today, he cosponsored one.
Thank you!!
So you're thanking him for screwing the people. Look at the fine print just another attempt by Heller to damage us
I think they are trying to fix a broken system.  You must be one of the few who will be able to afford the insurance!
You are trying to cover up turning your back on your constituents, including Medicaid recipients. Shame on u 4 lying
Heller claims new bill will increase NV's Medicaid $ based on an extremely misleading comparison of apples & oranges http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/dean-heller-nevada-medicaid-block-grant … 
You are a liar #DeanHeller
In June, Heller said he wouldn't vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid & Medicaid expansion. Today, he cosponsored one. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/dean-heller-nevada-medicaid-block-grant … 
You are such a Liar! 14 of 17 counties weren't going to be able to by ins? Bullshit!! Ins is sold statewide not by county. Your plan SUCKS!
ACTUALLY Tracey, Ins plans & rates are filed by state region. So no plans were filed in the state regions that included those 14 counties.

You mean the one where you back off your promise to protect NV & Medicaid and not kick millions off their insurance?
Graham unveils Obamacare repeal bill that would deeply cut Medicaid. @SenDeanHeller @RonJohnsonWI @BillCassidy are on board. 
I do not trust you.
