@SenDeanHeller do not repeal, and do not defund Planned Parenthood
@SenDeanHeller Without health insurance there is NO discussion. Period. Red wedding coming in 2018
With the exception to #womensRights & #freedom relating to #reproductiveHealth @SenateGOP?? - #ReproRights #AbortionIsHealthcare #surrogacy
@SenDeanHeller does this apply to women as well does this mean you defend a woman's right to make HER own decisions #pp #Choice
@SenDeanHeller you REPEAL #ACA we REPLACE you. Fix it. Don't Repeal.
@SenDeanHeller Yes!
Do not take away health insurance for all of us. You should have the same insurance we all have.
@SenDeanHeller I'm already making my health care decisions  with my doctor.  If I lose insurance, then no help from doctors.
We know the Rep don't want health care. Fix ACA don't repeal which hurts Nevadans. Do what's right, not political!
what's your replacement plan?
My healthcare decisions are between me and my doctor ACA allows me to have a doctor not just medicine when critical. People first
I long for the day when your tired old beliefs will pass from this Earth.
I long for the day THEY pass from this earth!
Medicare for all- like you have
@SenDeanHeller 
Oh, hell NO!
A vote repealing the ACA
will help defeat you in 2018!
We are watching you!
@WashoeDEMS RT
@SenDeanHeller Nevada's citizens depend on ACA. #representNevada
such as pregnancy?
@SenDeanHeller Just toeing that party line ain't ya? Grow a set and do what's right ....people need health care!
Except when it's a woman's decision with her body.
@SenDeanHeller yes! #prochoice #pp #WomensMarch #TheResistance #ResistTrump
@SenDeanHeller Show us replace before you REPEAL
@SenDeanHeller Stop repeating this stupid mantra. You don't have a better plan, so drop it. The ACA is a good program.
We the People want Jeff Sessions as AG!
Stop the repeal crap.  Let's see what plans you have to replace first! (unless you don't have anything).....?
they had years to come up with something. They've been bitching the entire time. They planned on repeal!
Kinda hard to make a decision about your healthcare without insurance.
BS GOP talking points.  We will not be able to buy insurance if we are old, sick, have pre-existing conditions.
@SenDeanHeller LIES LIES LIES HANDS OFF OUR HEALTHCARE OR WE SHUT DOWN DC. SIGNED, AMERICA #GOPUTIN #RUSSIAGATE
What Say you on the illegal Ban on Muslims?  Take a stand
@SenDeanHeller congress healthcare to be repealed with ACA and replace with same coverage as American people
@SenDeanHeller Decisions are meaningless if you don't have coverage. Improve it don't repeal it!
& not the Federal govt either; Red party out of my womb!
@SenDeanHeller Repealed ACA with congress healthcare they should have the same care as American people
so after 8 years you don't really have a plan except to give states control? leave ACA alone! and stop whining about voter fraud.
@SenDeanHeller Start looking for new jobs crooks, we the people have seen evidence of your treason and will remove you shortly.
Then why are a bunch of men telling women what they can and can't do? And why repeal without a good replacement?
Does that apply to all women, too, or just men?
This doesn't even make sense.  Before ACA these decisions were made by insurance providers.  Which side are u on?
@SenDeanHeller do it and we will make sure we have a new senator come elections
@SenDeanHeller millions of Americans are going to lose healthcare if you repeal #Obamacare. Don't you care about that??
6+yr repeal CAMPAIGN is OVER. Time NOW for DETAILS on GOP plan re: PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, LIFETIME CAP LIMITS, HIGH RISK POOLS.
@SenDeanHeller we need to make sure there is a vialble solution before it is repealed. What do you have planned
Our government has NO PLACE in my doctor's office!
ANY #prolife person should be for universal health coverage. Debate.
Instead they are made by for-profit insurance cos and for-profit HC execs. See what I'm getting at? HC shouldn't be for-profit.
@mmflint @RealdonaldTrump if you repeal ACA, Senate  & House must enroll in the replacement program. #resist
if you repeal obamacare I will be sentenced to death. I am on $3000/month medication. I have very expensive surgery I still need.
life life insurance as a diabetic I can buy it but I'd be better off just putting money in a savings account do to Premium cost
and how are you going to keep it affordable for everyone and guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions
and they have NO RIGHT to tell a woman what she can/can't do with her own body!
Government should assist the people to pay fr it.  Seeing a doctor should not just be for the rich and well off.  We are talking about lives
But everyone needs affordable care.
Then be sure CEOs of Insurance Co and Banks get their $50mil a year, with GOP senators getting their cut. Ryan McConnell get more
@SenDeanHeller shameful to remove ACA without full transparency of replacement
don't leave us in the lurch. SHOW US THE PLAN!
Fancy words to justify your greed!!
@SenDeanHeller repeal ACA and we will vote you out of office. #Election2018
I'm glad we agree...now leave my uterus alone!
Like women's reproduction? #hypocrites
, Am suffering from Mental illness and brain tumour . Diognosis huge surgery temperatures , mixed reactions swollen body parts
You passing the buck to the states and Republican states are those with the most in need. You lack the empathy for your citizens
@HealthInsDepot ACA’s grandfather https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/senate-bill/1770 …
 hypocrisy is a terrible thing
don't forget the for-profit insurance companies!  They need a say!  Money over preexisting conditions
then dont mess with PP, hypocrites! If you dont like abortion then simply dont have 1! Ur not God u have no right to judge
Keep up the good work but don't add taxes to tax reform. Follow @realDonaldTrump lead.
FIX ACA. FIX ACA. FIX ACA. FIX ACA
FIX ACA---DO NOT Repeal/Replace---we ALL know there will be no replace!
I call BS !!
how @ having a PLAN to replace BEFORE u repeal???  If it were ur families health care @ issue I'm sure you'd do it RIGHT!!!
give us the option to pay for the same plan you get!!!
So, that would include women's reproductive rights, right? So, WHAT ARE YOU DOING LEGISLATING THEM???
The only choice you're giving ppl by repealing ACA is whether to get medical help or go bankrupt. This is a sad reality.

don't repeal the 1st ever health care coverage for millions and millions of Americans who have never had health care!
keep the insurance.  Millions of people are on it. Keep it
That's great but without insurance no doctor visits.
unless the patient, family, and doctor decide on abortion, right?
cool, where is the plan???
@SenDeanHeller You support a woman's right to choose? That's exactly what this banner states. #IStandWithPP
Explain
@SenDeanHeller So wrong!! Why would you want to do this to your country? Public Option!!!! Or forgo your taxpayer funded care!
I have never ever had government involvement in my conversations with my doctor. Please educate me to how happens with Obamacare
really see no irony is posting this & their steps against women this week, even endangering developing countries.Such hypocrites!
You will kill many people in NV who are protected by NCA
@cspanwj You are exactly right. So can we expect repeal and no further involvement of the Federal Government? Or are you lying?
@SenDeanHeller thats not what u r trying 2 do. U want to take health care from millions with no other plan U get same as us Deal?
just repealing is a death sentence for up to 43,000 Americans a year, how patriotic of you.
Like reproductive rights, pre-existing conditions, services for kids. States shouldn't be allowed to mandate different care vs other states
yes with what plan for healthcare? Do you have one? Because right now you're just getting rid of ACA with nothing to replace it.
Exactly. #mybodymychoice #supportplannedparenthood #RiseUp
As a provider, I agree some regulations are over reaching but we MUST have oversight to make sure the RIGHT things are done.
In other words - We, Republicans, don't want anything to do with your healthcare
That's a slogan, where's the Plan?
including family planning and a woman's ability to choose.
@SenDeanHeller unless they want to go to planned parenthood. Seems like a lot of women will have less choice.
@SenDeanHeller @SpeakerRyan You are all so dishonest!  You lied about Aetna but now the truth is revealed.#makeAmericasick
then why are hospital and physical groups opposing the appeal?
Why does the GOP insist on killing people?
Pls dont make health care costs even worse than they are. Heart test cost more w/exp. Gold Plan than self pay 1yr prior. WHY?
they don't make my healthcare decisions. They just make it so I can actually have acces to & afford it!
#ObamacareRealityCheck
@SenDeanHeller and how do you guarantee that it will be affordable for all per your Leader? #unpresidented
standard of care should Not be determined by insurance companies either. They want their profits and deny coverage
Including women choosing to have an abortion? A decision between them and their doctors, or does it include Senators?
Healthcare shouldn't segregate. Every American deserves a right to choose what's best for his or her body.

.@SenateGOP woah, wait! Then why do you pass laws legislating a woman's womb? You have a confusing message, you get that right?
agreed! Health care decisions should be made by patients, families, and doctors not by "for profit" insurers dictates

ACA brought healthcare to 10's of 1000 that would not have had any. Why should I subsidize yours for the rest of your life?
you are the murderers from all the 47000 ppl in Florida who will die without ACA. #MURDERERS
YES and also not insurance co. Some of our pts could not get treatment because ins wouldn't pay or paid very little!
people will die and their ghost will travel in your well lined pockets  crooks!
What we NEED is someone that will help fix ACA. We have 30+ million whose lives depend on it!
so why are you leaving the insurance regs and gov't run health care in place?
unless it has to do with female reproduction rights.
YOU FECKLESS #COWARDLYLIARS, without access, which in the USA means insurance very few get to even have choices! SHAME SAD!
Are you seriously saying the ACA doesn't allow me to make my own decisions about healthcare. Bless your heart. #profiterring
That's great! But if we don't have healthcare at all, how can we make any decision. Ask your constituents what they want.
ProLife Party should  ACA. Abortionrate is at an all time low since ACA was enacted .
You left out one thing. MONEY. No $? Easy decision! GTFOH!
#Hateful republicans
YES!!! Like abortion!!!  #WomenMarch #ResistTrump
since insurance has little to do with your stmt, I'm confused?? #clowntrain
This is true 100%, hold true or we will hold you responsible.
Does that include decisions between a woman and her doctor at places like @PPact?
NO!
