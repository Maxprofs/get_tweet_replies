Dont know abt this guy, but money is big item on table for a lot of Senators. 'donations'
@RealGrumpyGirlhub @SenDeanHeller @gbcnevada He is a GOP shill
no on DeVos AND HOW ABOUT TAKING PHONE CALLS OR RESETTING V-MAIL
Nevada ranks at the bottom of education year after year. You're part of the problem.
nice sure why you're lieing about giving a damn about education. You've already proven Devos money is all
YOU SOLD OUT NEVADA'S CHILDREN. WE WILL NOT FORGET YOUR DEVOS VOTE.
so nice that you're interested in Nevadans education when you voted yes for Devos. #disappointed
deplorable decision to confirm #devos, you will rue this day.
Great Program!  Proud of @gbcnevada! How long until until @BetsyDeVos  tries to privatize it or shut it down?
Thanks to you @gbcnevada won't have students smart enough to qualify for their school.
Your entire party just proved that democracy is a sham, you are lying, corrupt, and not here to represent the people.
EVERYONE TIRED OF BEING MARGINALIZED AND IGNORED REMEMBER THIS IN 2018
Bummer about your DeVos vote. You obviously do not care about those whom you have been appointed to serve.
Voting for Devos will prove to be a COSTLY mistake. Our children's education has been sold to the highest bidder.
Too bad higher ed policy is also under Dept of Ed and you supported #DeVos; to support this program needed NO vote
address the Betsy DeVos issue because IT is a disaster. We will remember your vote and will see you I 2018.
Why don't to come to largest city in NV? VOTE HELLER OUT 2018. Mnuchin & Devos! You must hate NV. Hail King Trump
I am deeply disappointed. You could have been a hero. It's a sad day when party and money trump what's best for our kids.
Kiss your career goodbye!  Your failure to do the will of your constituents will result in your undoing!! 89434
Shame on you for voting for DeVos-stuff your pockets now, you'll need a new job in 2018
enjoy your forced retirement in 2018.
I've never worked on a campaign, but after DeVos situation, I'm volunteering for whoever is running against you.
You ignored your constituents and voted for DeVos. Can't wait to vote you out in 2018. Bye bye.
you tweet about quality education and vote for DeVos? Is this a joke?
You voted for Devos... i hope you know the shit storm coming your way. 11/06/18
really, no one cares, you are helping tear this country apart. How many of your constituents said no on DeVoss?
I'm a public school teacher in your state. No pay to play. #DumpDevos
Get active with Indivisible group
Expect you'll rubber stamp Sessions, but ur we  disagree.  Who do u work for?  Constituents or GOP. Grow a spine.
how disgraceful and disappointing. Your political career is over. Grow a pair...if you want to remain a senator
Goodbye in 2018...thanks for standing up for the People of Nevada. #BetsyDevosIsTheNailInYourCoffin
Don't u mean "thank you for pretending to support Nevadans"
my parents moved to Nevada two years ago and they say your healthcare sucks! She has to go to urgent care
because of long waits for primary care. So poorly run
How much money did the Devos family promise you for your vote? 
gonna donate against you, vote against you, tweet against you, everything I can until you are voted out of office
NEVADA is already struggling. You really let us down today!
SELLOUT
You have no Spine!
we'll never forget what you did in ignoring your constituents & voting for DeVos. You are done in 2018.
vote NO on #devos
I will donate and rally votes for your opponent as well as many teachers, parents, and college students in NV in 2018.
supports Trump nominee Devos, over disabled children... grab em by the  Senate seat!
since when do you care about students and education? Not today, that's certain. Your vote shows you care for GOP
you are a spineless senator and I can't wait to vote you out in 2018 like you voted away education for children 
and voted in someone who has zero education and experience. Don't listen to your constituents, vote him out 2018 
You will be GONE in 2018!
It makes me sick that you ignore the people of NV
has just voted yes for DeVos. That's a wrap, folks. Let's get to work for next year. #VoteHellerOut
@KOLO8 Hey KOLO - how about a story on how Heller ignores his constituents?  Look at the comments re: #DumpDevos
No on DeVos. Stand up for competency in leadership.

This is NOT partisan. Every1 shld be concrnd. Particularly low income, IEP, rural! Pls vote NO- ur phones r jammed

Congratulations...no day will go by in next 2 years when voters won't be reminded of your vote to undermine PEd
Speaking of students, as a student at UNLV with two siblings that attend high school in LV, I urge you to vote #NoOnDeVos!
- You're a SELL OUT! You're BAD for NV / American children & will LOSE YOUR SENATE SEAT in 2018!  Pack your bags.
No on Devos would show how much you care about students and their education.
Please vote NO on DeVos!!!!!!!
Speaking of students, please do what's right for them! Vote no on Devos!
Sir,please do the right thing! Vote NO on Ms. DeVos. How can you sleep knowing how wrong she is for the future of education?
HOW ABOUT THOSE STUDENTS? VOTE NO ON DEVOS
a no on Devos is A yes for Heller. Nevada is watching
but how many came from public schools? What choice do students in rural Nevada? Choice doesn't make sense for NV!
Please vote no on DeVos today if you care about education. U KNO u wldnt hire some1 that unprepared 2 work 4 u.
DeVos will hurt schools like GBC & favor predatory for-profit "Universities" that spend huge sums on deceptive ads
Senator Heller, please listen to your constituents and stand with American school children. Vote NO on Bet$y DeVo$
Then please #SaveACA so health market does not destabilize. Also vote no on Price
.@SenDeanHeller Nevada students will suffer if DeVos is confirmed. Please listen to the people; kids are more important than the party line.
I urge you to reconsider your position on DeVos. Next year is an election year & our memories will not be short.
