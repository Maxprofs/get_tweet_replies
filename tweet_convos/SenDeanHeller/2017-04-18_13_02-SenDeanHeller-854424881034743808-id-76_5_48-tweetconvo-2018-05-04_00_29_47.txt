Is he getting money from Russia or China we are employing him and have a right to know if he's using his position for personal gain!
Yes, it would also be simpler if 45 would release his taxes.
We do need tax reform. We need a tax code that is structured w/ all ctzns considered. Not a hatchet job like AHCA.
Not until we see his taxes. Oh yeah. #2018iscoming
It's also a reminder that you as a member of the MAJORITY party are allowing trump to hide his taxes that he said he release. Who where when

As a Senator that dodges hard questions using @MarkAmodeiNV2 as a foil its time you had a real town hall. 600 people at #nvtownhall SAD!
Hypocrite you just want to pay less. I'm sick of all you liars and hope that 1 day soon you'll be living out on the streets!
We do not trust you to do honest TAX reform.  Trump must show his taxes. .@SpeakerRyan .@MarkAmodeiNV2
The reminder is trump should release his!  Support your constituents and demand trump release his!
It's also a reminder that our president hasn't released his taxes. Get on him, Heller!
It is also a reminder that we haven't seen the #Taxes of @realDonaldTrump. We need to know he is acting in the best interests of Americans.
YOU need to tell the President that until he releases his taxes WE are not interested in any tax reform YOU propose. What NERVE!
then get to work doing something about the tax code
Get to work on a better tax code
What we rally need is a Senator that votes for his constituents not for lobbyists money! #2018VoteHelletOut
How about a fair one for plutocrats,  billionaires and multinational Co's that pay too little of their fair share?
No you want the 1% to get those tax breaks! We will do everything we can to block the so-called tax reform. All Rep. out by 2020
We want to see @potus tax returns. Grow a pair @sendeanheller
Let's see 45's taxes so we know how the new tax code will benefit him and oh btw you too
Forget about #taxreform until Citizens have more representation. We do not trust Trump and R's to do it.
And you expect us to believe you--while you are look the other way on Trump's tax evasion, and take contributions from Adelson and Koch.

It's a reminder of this, sweetheart. No Trump taxes, no #TaxReform. Got that? #TaxDay
Stand up and stop Trump. Be the Change!
Time for our president to show his taxes. End of story. Get behind it or get out. Better yet we will just vote you out #VoteHellerOut2018
Do you stand with the voters/citizens of Nevada or do you stand with Trump? He says he's "smart" because he did not pay taxes. #NoLoopholes
.@SenDeanHeller No tax reform w/out knowing what conflicts 45 has with any proposals he & his Goldman co-conspirators ultimately propose!
Agreed!
Regarding tax $, Trump wants to include funding for a wall in the budget.  Really? Didn't he promise that Mexico would pay? Keep him honest.
Trumps Taxes! Demand to see them and conflicts of interest like Trump towers in Turkey!
What are you doing to t rump with foreign countries making their families products & the illegals he hires to work for him?
How about leading a GOP call for Trump to release his taxes? That could put a lot of speculation to bed!
How about #taxreturns? Aren't you a little curious about Trump's mysterious business ties?
Completely agreed. But we need to ensure it is fair for all income levels. And it would be nice to see @realDonaldTrump fillings.
Maybe we can talk about tax reform that benefits the middle and lower classes when you have a town hall? #HELLERNO2018 #ReleaseYourTaxes
How about reminding @realDonaldTrump to publish his tax returns? You support him & think he's great--make him prove he has nothing to hide.
Bernie Sanders wants a simplified and fair way to do taxes too. Maybe you should talk to him before you're voted out?
@SenDeanHeller will you work to force tRump to release his taxes?
Trump Taxes?  Are you tone deaf?  Stop preaching taxes until you do something about Trump's.  That is both fair and simple. #Nevada
When the next vote to have *45 release his vote yes. Or we will vote no on you. #ReleaseYourTaxes #TrumpTaxes
Stop with the #lies @SenDeanHeller You are a #political #puppet for one of the biggest #tax #cheats that ever was #Trump #LasVegas #Nevada
We need a system that's not rigged for the Oligarchy! There is NO trickle down in America. Except Chobani!!!
You know, we know, and 45 knows, he's not interested in serving the country. Get him out of office, I bet you'll keep your job.
Dean, I have a really good idea. File the papers for trumps impeachment procedures. Just do a 180.
If he did he may get to keep his job in 2018
Why do U continue 2 play the straight man, throw out these tweets & set us up 4 great zingers? A knack 4 comedy? #hellerout2018 #TrumpTaxes
We Need To See Trump's Taxes!!!!!
Flat Tax is the only fair tax.
Wow @senDeadHeller your mentions look like a tire fire.  I think your constituents are woke AF.  2018 ought to be fun for you.
Yes, the outrage of Trump paying more in taxes both in % to income & monetarily according to @maddow MSM has You sheep outraged over what?
Hope you mean reform for the working Joe, not just breaks for the rich.
How about you also work to raise taxes on the rich so they stop bragging about how little of our society they fund. #RaiseTheirTaxes
Huh let's took about that after @potus releases his taxes. How do you feel about Ivanka getting Chinese trademarks after Mara logo-ing w/Xi
Trusting Republicans with tax reform? Sorry, but I'll pass. Unless, of course, we can compare this against Trump's tax returns, hm??
Real reform please, not upward redistribution in disguise.
We need wealth redistribution so that the middle class who haven't had a real wage increase in 40 years can participate in the economy.
You don't care about Nevadans. Just spouting @GOP partyline bull and pushing more free $ for your master Adelson. Out in 2018.
have you show. Up at a townhall yet?
No #taxreform until we know how it will benefit Trump. We deserve transparency--will you work on that for us, Dean? #ReleaseYourTaxes
How can we have tax reform under a president with a known history of questionable tax practices, and who hides his tax returns? #TaxDay
The decisions you have made for our state are going to determine your fate in the next elections. You have failed Nevada as a Senator!
Maybe after we vote you out next year, you can work on that as a private citizen. Answer us Senator...."yes or no"
