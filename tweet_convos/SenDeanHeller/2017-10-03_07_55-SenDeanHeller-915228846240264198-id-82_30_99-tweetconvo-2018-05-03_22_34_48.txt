but we're not humbled by your continued support of the NRA. #enough
Did you donate blood?
How about donating all the $ the NRA gave you?
Thank God for the NRA.  I am so happy they support Trump.

Wow that's a great picture of yourself.  You look good.
Why, thank you sweetie!
Are you going to answer the question or would you prefer not to?
I certainly understand . . .
You didn't ask me a question????   What would you like to know?
Strict gun control laws must be implemented to stop these massacres. We demand action.
Wow, money from the Koch's to repeal ACA & kill Nevadans, money from NRA that directly killed Nevadans, and you're humbled? Get a clue man!
This was a set up by Democracts & Antifa. Don't you dare use this tragedy to destroy our Constitutional right to bear arms.
OUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!!!!
If you worked on gun control, maybe we wouldn't have these tragic scenes so often. Do you even have a conscience??? #NRABloodMoney
Did Obama work on gun control in his eight years in office?  No?  In fact he approved Bump Stocks.
Did you support the ban on assault weapons?  I doubt it.
You should be since you support the one organization who hurt us.
What’s your plan to stop mass shootings?
Unlike you who were not their for their healthcare needs.
how about supporting us with some laws that will at least try to prevent this from happening again?
.@SenDeanHeller took in $21,350+++ directly from @NRA & has horrible record on reducing gun violence. 

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
great that people care to donate.  even better if country passes sensible bipartisan gun legislation to prevent senseless deaths.
If you want to show real support and concern, stand up and work to enact effective gun control.  #GunContolNow
How are we going to stop these guns? bump stocks? Selling mass amounts of ammo? Mass amounts of guns? When will YOU ALL stop it? #sad 
What about doing something to change the easy access to automatic weapons
Maybe you should take a note,, We Back our own,, unlike some we know!!
Humbled? How about embarrassed that ur inaction on gun control & support for silencer bill leads to events like this?
Humbled?  After empowering the @NRA?  You've taken money from all sides and here, Mr. Heller is just some of the fallout of your greed.  Give Blood.  You've already taken the blood money.
Are you upset at Hillary and Obama for taking money from Weinstein?
Humbled? And ashamed at the bloodshed your policies cause? Enough do affect change?
And as much as you hope the gun narrative will go away, it won't. The best thing Trump gave to America is the exposure of corruption of #GOP
You have blood on your hands you hypocrite! Commit TODAY to stop US citizens from owning weapons of mass destruction - aka machine guns.
Accepting @NRA 
We have a great city here Dean.  You should get out and see it more often
That's great. What will YOU DO, IN YOUR POSITION, to make sure this doesn't happen to them again? #LasVegasMassacre
How about focusing on gun control!!!
Guns are a right - but healthcare is a 'PRIVLAGE'
That's wonderful! Now take the lead to create smart, thoughtful gun policies in this country!
Nevada needs a new senator.
YOU have A grade from NRA, do 'what needs to be done' support common sense gun control bills #LasVegasShooting. You are part of the problem
Stop the NRA
FIX THE GUN PROBLEM!!!
#VoteLikeYouMeanIt #NRAIsATerroristGroup #EndGunViolence
Ashamed that my #senator takes blood money from @NRA #Midterms are coming 
How about you do your part! Say no to the #NRA and #EndGunViolence
As their representatives in Congress and the Senate attempt to stick their thumbs further into their own assholes.
But you support the NRA. You are part of the problem.
Stand up to the NRA if you really care about us. You've sold our freedom for living in peace to the highest bidder. Shame on you
FYI, NRA's members are American people as well.  Your beliefs and opinions, do not outweigh other Americans beliefs.
...and I hate to break it to you, but there are also Democrats in the NRA.
Stop taking money #BloodMoney! The #VegasShooting is free advertising for the @NRA, gun sales increase. #BloodForProfit
ATTABOY AWARD: Good Job Nevada. The world is learning a lesson from you! Love your compassion and spirit! God bless you!
Save ur prayers and concern. Tell the NRA to fuck off and support common sense gun measures.
Please tell us a SPECIFIC action you'll take to protect USA. #NV residents & visitors re: #guncontrol. Praying is easy. Courage takes balls.
@SenDeanHeller #VegasStrong Nevadans always come together GOP MUST stop kissing NRA' s ASS PUT SAVING LIVES ORNOW'S THE TIME FOR DISCUSSION
So what did Obama do in his eight years in office?  Oh that's right, nothing.
Newsflash: This isn’t about you or your “humility.” You are a First Class self-serving political assh*le.
These people believe in helping those in need and if you asked them I imagine they'd say they were against automatic weapons. Unlike you.
I guess since prostitution is legal in NV, makes it easier for you. Talk your republican friends into legalization in their states.
You are 1 of 46 who voted against sensible gun control. I'm sure the parents of the 59 people who died are glad this aftermath "humbles" you
Wouldn’t it be nice if they didn’t need to? #bloodmoney #NRA
Vote no on gun silencers. Protect your constituents against gun violence.
Support Nevadans by giving back the money you accepted from the NRA
Wait until you see the number of people lined up to vote against you next year for all the votes you've made to kill us. You're done.
Notice how no "good guy with a gun" stopped this? Easy access to weapons of war caused this. If law abiding ppl could not get guns like  /1
It would have been prevented. 1 No silencers; 2 -Ban assault weapons with no grandfatger clause; 3 - allow us to sue gun mftrs for easily /2
Converted or simulated fully auto; 4- background checks for all gun purchases; 5 - no  fly list = no gun purchase: 6- no mentally ill /3
Can buy guns. Put the right to LIFE , liberty of the majority of Americans, ahead of gun rights.
They're too good for you, Senator.
How much did NRA pay you for that blurb? #GunContolNow
Don't support the silencer bill. It will make things worse.  #LasVegasShooting #VegasStrong
#VivaLasVegas
Agreed. 
Is the GOP planning to do anything? Introduce any legislation? Or is this the price we pay for freedom?
Completely agree. Now, what are you doing to stop the next attack? Thank god we have good healthcare workers in the country.
Don’t be humbled! Put a stop to this we want sensible #GUNCONTROLNOW
You mean there isn't a photo op of you donating?  You should have to talk w/victim fam and tell them how you take money from NRA. #assultban
He did his photo op of "looking concerned" yesterday.
Ya he made sure he mug was positioned directly behind Sheriff. Disgusting because we know Deano doesn't give a shit  about LV.
Hypocrite!
You are part of the problem, not the solution. Your time will soon be up and you'll be replaced by someone who'll work 4 the constituents.
Humbled enough to start talking gun control?
Want to apologize for voting against background checks in 2013 and return your NRA blood money?
We are Americans, surely there is a common sense way to inhibit the occurrence of these mass shootings.
If only our senior senator would look out for nevadans by not trying to take away their healthcare and give tax breaks to the super rich.
