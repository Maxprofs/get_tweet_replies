Vote no on healthcare. No one wants it. People will die. No !!!!!
Wise up support the American people, Stand up with President Trump
What about the constituency in the baba no. Who do you represent anyway?
It's awesome that you care about this 6 months after it happened, and after the company heads got to sell their company stock! Explain that!
SenHeller, The Graham Cassidy Bill, that you support, would take away insurance from Vets and Elderly Ppl &children.30 million Americns lose
Why do you only care about service members and vets? You have a lot of regular constituents. We voted. We matter.
What about the rest who had homes taken during a short sale? #Credit #ruined for 7 years because of #greedy #banks #Nevada #LasVegas #Nv
Why only servicemembers?
Wow so awesome you looking after us dweebs like that.  How's your personal taxpayer funded class A medical working out for you and the fam?
#HellerDoesNotCare
NO time for a proper CBO score? Your willing to risk millions of ppls health & 1/6th of US economy w/out CBO? SAD! Pres golf trips r ok tho?
HellerDoesNotCare
What about the rest of us Dean?
of the 1.2M touched how many are Vets? 

you get my point I hope.
as many others have said what about the rest of us? 

you're lowering the bar day by day.
Ummm. What actions are being taken for ALL of your constituents ahole?
Then you voted to deregulate the industry anyway. You're a fucking fraud.
Sen Heller,your words and actions are meaninglss as you supprt the GrahamCassidy bill whch will take insurnce away from your most vulnerable
Please say NO to GrahamCassidy death bill
#CassidyGrahamBill is bad for vets, icymi.
Lack of funding over next decade will cause great suffering! @GovSandoval rejects this bill
I wrote to Senator Heller asking what actions are being taken to protect twenty million people from losing their health care.
That is all you seem to care about is service members!
How about protecting residents with pre-existing conditions, or capping lifetime coverage for disabled children? What actions are u taking
#HellerDoesNotCare
Lol. You laud and fawn over Mnuchin who ran a robo-sign foreclosure mill fleecing Nevadans. You want us to believe you care about consumers?
Good now save their healthcare.
You need to worry about your actions and vote no on the healthcare bill
Ooh!  Such brave action. Who bought and paid for that worthless act?
Hey Dean, your colleague .@SenCortezMasto is addresing the issue for ALL of us. Why only military for you?
What about the rest of us?
What about just regular working Americans who are also your constituents?
Ah, we are focused on your destruction of Obamacare for thousands of Nevadans.
And the poor who need health care. How are you protecting them?
Party over country & constituents! Willing to strip Health Care from millions to make Koch Bros happy! Thought you had a SPINE!
I bet they didn't say that they were taking away or eroding healthcare coverage because that would be very rude #CassidyGrahamJohnsonHeller
Here's your answer! Sold your soul to the devil & betrayed your constituents! Vote for GC=Career over, no matter what Trump promised!
You need to write your president and tell him you won't support that abomination of a health care bill.  Or we'll write no on our '18 ballot
Lip service to servicemembers because he knows 45 is marching us toward a war with North Korea. Other than that #HellerDoesNotCare
What actions are being taken to protect Americans from your abomination of a "health care" bill?

Please enjoy your last year in the senate.
Senator Heller we count on you to veto the latest healthcare fiasco. Please stand against the tyranny of trump and his cronies.
Please vote "no" on Graham-Cassidy.
Avalere study means GOP Senators now know exactly what they're voting for, even without CBO score:

http://wapo.st/2faIUO9  

Equifax not the 1st incident of stolen servicemember data: VA & OPM hacked at least once. Fox already left hen house.
How about protecting the rest of us?
what actions are being taken to protect citizens from extortion healthcare? Your bill makes it worse for entrepreneurs and creators. SHAME
You should write to @GovSandoval instead and resign.  You are a failed senator who has no confidence from his constituents.
How about Nevadans?  I'm a Nevadan and I want to know what they will do as they offer but one year protect...but this will last for decades
Your Healthcare bill is the worst yet! 
Millions without Healthcare & doesn't cover pre existing con.
Your willing to harm your own ppl.
Why don't you ever do or come up with or sign something, by yourself? So you can back away if it goes bad? That's why @DannyTarkanian  2018
What are you going to do for the people and their families of Nevada when you strip insurance from them? #GrahamCassidyDeathBill?
Sounds just like #Cult45. Did #Cult45 teach him how to use the military as a diversion tactic in tough times?
Please work on a bipartisan effort (as you were elected to do) to fix the Affordable Care Act.

DO YOUR JOB - before you are voted out
Says the man working to save his job (it won't work) at the expense of 30 million plus. #Hellerdoesntcare
I will help you with #HellerDoesn'tCare, brilliant.
Vote NO on your dangerous health bill - !! Call DEAN HELLER. #voteoutdeanheller #GrahamCassidyBill
Tick tock @SenDeanHeller 2018 can’t come fast enough
You have lost your way!
Too bad you don't care as much about our Healthcare.
You just might be the worst senator ever.
Every day you tweet something ridiculous. How do you sleep at night stealing HC from millions? Including service members. #VoteHellerOut
#HellerDoesNotCare
This bill is an attack on women. We will remember in '18 and you will lose your seat. #VoteHellerOut
Vote to protect your constituents, not your party. Vote against #GrahamCassidy
#HellerDoesNotCare
Really? You show so much concern for members of the military yet completely disregard the needs of every other Nevadan. You are shameful.
Do you care about those of us that aren't service members? Every time you get in hot water with your constituents you talk military.
Sounds just like #Cult45. Did #Cult45 teach him how to use the military as a diversion tactic in tough times?
.@SenDeanHeller Do you realize how dumb you sound with this tweet?  What the rest of us Americans who are compromised by this data breach?
#HellerDoesn'tCare!
Who cares?
Not Dean Heller.
The same actions that won't be protecting Nevadans and Service Members because you will side with them over Nevadans https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/technology/2017/9/18/16328170/equifax-credit-data-breach-justice-department …
#pandering
Hypocrites. You want to claim concern about service members, then rip away their health care.  There are 1,750,000 veterans on Medicaid.
Sounds just like #Cult45. Did #Cult45 teach him how to use the military as a diversion tactic in tough times?
Absolutely.  They are experts at diversion.  We will not, however, be distracted.  Eyes on the prize.  Saving our families from destruction.
What about the rest of us
What actions are you taking to protect the sick,the elderly,the children of Nevada and all across America
Come on Sen. Heller...you put this out there as if it will make up for the disaster to Vets & all other Nevadans that is #GrahamCassidySucks
#HellerDoesNotCare
What about everyone else too?
What about the rest of us?
Bye!
I'll be frank - I don't believe a word you say anymore.
#hellerdoesn'tcare
Have you even read grahams healthcare bill? You should understand it before you sacrifice your career for it.
Nobody cares asshat. Do not take away health coverage! VOTE NO ON #TrumpCare #AssHat
Can you both tell the American people what will be taken away from them in the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
#HellerDoesNotCare
Just service members?
#HellerDoesNotCare
“Servicemembers”?  If you address the heart of the issue, US Military personnel’s issues will also be addressed.

Trump faked bone spurs.
Why all the lies?!? #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 

Sen @BillCassidy called our reading of his health care bill on pre-existing conditions false. Here’s how we read it: http://n.pr/2fAWevD  https://twitter.com/BillCassidy/status/910316563047337984 …
Why do you hate Americans? #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
Why don't you care about kids?? #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE.
