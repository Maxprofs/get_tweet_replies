Still protecting the #2A this morning Dean? Still #FriendsofTheNRA? Coward.
That's not being a coward, that's being courageous. Standing up for citizens' constitutional rights is also his job, so... yeah.
Cause the founding fathers guaranteed our right to carry automatic weapons. How about rocket launchers too? Maybe we should have nukes too.
Unless you are writing this with pen and quill, or orating from a soapbox, your argument is silly.
No, you're proving my point. Founders couldn't have imagined auto weapons, therefore couldn't have thought they'd be covered by 2A
They also could not have envisioned the Internet.  Yet it IS covered under the First Amendment.
By us not them. Same for weapons.
Nope.  Radio, TV, Internet, etc. are ALL covered under the First Amendment.  By the First Amendment.
Instead of praying, how about not taking checks from the NRA?
And just how much do you take from the NRA to get an A rating on your proposed legsilation
Don't pray! Stop accepting money from the NRA and help to make better gun laws for Nevada and the USA!!!
Prayers are not enough change the gun laws.  You accepted more than $40k in donations from the NRA. You have blood on your hands.

There's blood on your hands, sir. Can you justify voting "NO" on "limiting the size of magazines to 10 rounds now? #killer
Dean " mindless puppet" Heller will only do what he's told. The only way to change policy is to change representative.
With all due respect, your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. Use your platform to make REAL CHANGE to gun laws #GunControl #GunControlNow
STOP taking $$$$ from the NRA and others and start doing your job, you work for us, not them!!!!
Then how about doing something to make it less easy for this sort of thing to happen so frequently? Or do you just not care?
Keep your prayers to yourself, just like the $122,802 in assistance you received from the NRA.
Prayer won’t fix this @SenDeanHeller. These tragedies are preventable and you are an enabler. DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.
Praying? Why not try legislating? It’s much more effective.
VOTING for sensible gun control laws will work far more reliable than thinking and praying. Try it next time you get the opportunity.
Praying won't help. Our kids are being gunned down! Stand up to the gun lobby and apply some common sense!
We don't need prayers, we need action. The blood is on your hands #NRA
#VoteLikeYouMeanIt #LasVagasShooting
What else you gonna do?
We can all pray but you were elected to protect us. FIX IT NOW! Were 59 innocent lives worth the @nra $? #bloodmoney
Forget your prayers. Take action. Enact responsible gun control.
Yes thanks for tweeting your condolences when you have accepted over $21k in donations from the NRA behind the scenes
Voting for silencers for these American gun nuts? He could have held out a lot longer and murdered even more.
Your prayers are meaningless without action.  Vote NO on gun silencers and pass strict gun control legislation NOW!
Instead of praying, do something to stop the next one!
Every victim from the LV shooting now has a pre-existing condition. Remember that if repealing the ACA comes up again.  Shameful.
You voted against a ban on assault weapons, against limiting the size of magazines to 10 rounds & against background checks. Shame on You!
Not senseless- GOP has voted against all gun safety measures - you created this massacre
GOP and Heller have blood on their hands @NRA @SenDeanHeller
Praying doesn't do them much good now, Dean. How about getting behind some sensible legislation?
Are you going to give back the $21,350 you received from the National Rifle ASSociation, Senator?
#AnotherRepublicanHypocrite
Call it by it's name: White Male Terrorism
Your prayers aren't enough.
Don't just pray, PASS STRONGER GUN CONTROL. You have the power to get automatic weapons out of the hands of citizens and prevent tragedies
You keep on taking money from the NRA, when you stop, I'll  believe you.
Do more than pray. healthcare and gun control
#nrabloodmoney
When it comes to gun reform, seems like Republican congresspeople care more about taking the NRA’s money than they do about saving lives 

How does it feel knowing your going to lose reelection?
Instead of fruitless prayers, why don't you pass some solid firearms laws?
Which way did you vote on gun control?
Act to save lives by changing laws. Prayer without action is hypocrisy. Faith without works is dead, sadly, so too are many innocents.
.Yes - Made possible by YOU & other #NRA lackeys!
Time to show courage, compassion & wisdom -- & join bipartisan efforts for #GunControlNow!
If we want prayers we will call a priest.  Do your fucking job and pass firearm regulation.
I may be going out on a limb here, but I'd say the number one cause of shootings is guns.
Senator Heller, if by now you don't understand the mechanics of a mass shooting, you are too stupid to be in public service. Leave now.
give thoughts and prays to your vote against the 2013 Assault Weapons Ban
#Complicit
I’m sure the dead don’t care about prayers.
You allowing assault weapons to be purchased and open carry in your state is what is senseless and horrifying. Really, how bad do you feel? Your bank account is fat from the NRA! YOU ARE SHAMEFUL AND HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS!!!!!
Doesn't care about first responders and supports @NFL players protest.
.@SenDeanHeller took in $21,350+++ directly from @NRA & has horrible record on reducing gun violence. 

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Instead of offering "prayers", do something substantial...
Then why did you vote against limiting magazine size, assault weapons, and background checks?
I will tell you why. Because he doesn’t give a shit. He doesn’t care. Plain and simple.
Thoughts and prayers? If this guy hadn't had access to these items, those people would still be alive! You are as guilty as he is.
save your prayers and do something to stop gun violence!
Common sense gun laws please. Allow CDC to study gun violance. You can help change this. Please!
Then maybe you should stop taking NRA blood money.
Please Sen., enough with the thoughts and prayers. Stop taking NRA $ and stand up for American lives! Please. It's actually a popular stand.
Now are you prepared to do something?!
save us your #thoughtsandprayers, #SendBackTheBloodMoney and get to work on #CommonSenseGunControl
Stuff prayers. Put thoughts into action to stop this madness. Otherwise, you're a coward who values money and power over people's lives.
Do something about it! Please. Lip service does't stop bullets.
When public servants put the safety of the people above the money of the NRA. If you are a member, fight to change ir become complict.
Nevada Senator Dean Heller voted against limits on magazine size, assault weapons, background checks
You & the GOP are petrified of the gun lobby, & have utterly failed. Thoughts and prayers don't work!  Common sense gun laws will help.
You voted against the assault weapons ban. Your words mean nothing.
How's about you return the $21,350 you received from the @NRA? Does that come with automatic thoughts and prayers? #bloodmoney @igorvolsky
Don't let the silencer bill pass a vote in the Senate...that would be meaningful.  If Paddock had a silencer, how many more??
So do something about it. Prayers are not enough.
Remember when u voted NO on Manchin-Toomey amendment after Sandy Hook massacre? SHAME ON YOU. You have failed Nevada and protected no one.

this blood is on YOUR hands. YOU voted to block efforts for tighter gun laws. maybe stop "praying" and TAKE ACTION this time.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney.  Hypocrite
Screw your prayers & screw the NRA. Ban assault rifles, FFS!
How about a “Thoughts and Prayers Gun Control Act.”
Why did you vote for automatic rifles and larger magazines?
3 ways to prevent #LasVegas shooting. 1. Ban crazy people 2. Ban outdoor concerts 3. Ban guns. Take your pick. #GunControlNow #mandalaybay
Why did you co-sponsor legislation banning gun registration & trigger lock law if you really care about keeping your state safe?
Remember when you took 42K from the gun lobby to vote against tougher gun laws? I'd say thats pretty senseless & horrifying too.
How about @SenDeanHeller you do something about guns in this country. You voted to make it easier for nut jobs to get them.
Praying gets you.....killed by white guys who are afraid of losing their privilege, so they buy all the guns available WITHOUT RESTRICTION.
Gun laws please. With silencers it would be more dead
#LasVegas #LasVegasShooting Stop abetting the #NRA's arming Americans with weapons of mass death for $.
When U spread ur hands in prayer I hide my eyes from you even when U offer many prayers I'm not listening. Ur hands are full of blood Is1:15
Prayers are not enough. Get out of the NRA purse and enact laws that actually PROTECT citizens. Vote with your feet.
Prayers appreciated but you actually have power to enact protective policy for Americans. #dosomethingGOP
And what exactly were you thinking when you voted against Sen. Feinstein's 2013 Assault Weapons Ban? Please think again!
WHY ARE AUTOMATIC/SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS AVAILABLE IN OUR COUNTRY? 
American citizens being hunted! 
YOUR VOTE & NRA LOBBY MONEY TO BLAME!
Prayers are hollow. How much do you take from your NRA OVERLORDS????
You voted against background check, limits on mag sizes, ban on assault weapons. I don't want to hear your whining. Blood is on your hands.
If only u could have done something to minimize this tragedy. Like vote to limit mag sizes and extend assault rifle ban. Oh... I see.
As if praying ever changed anything. You should lobby for gun control. But that would mean to actually do something...
Maybe while you are at it, you can ask forgiveness for voting against the assault weapon ban?  Shame on you!  You made this possible!
Than do something about gun control. This happens way to often.
You continue to vote against common sense gun regs. You voted to keep high capacity mags legal. You heard that barrage of gun fire, right?
This all your fault Dean. You and OBAMA! Cause yoiu aint give all country music fans FREE GUNS!!!!! #maga #nra #kkk
How much money do u take from NRA? This is time to take a stand now not next week #nosenate4uin18
It's me, the guy who wants to close hundreds of trauma centers and wields considerable power, tweeting ineffectually
Do U Really Care? This President has Pandered To the NRA ALLOWING GUN SALES TO THE MENTALLY ILL ALL FOR VOTES! DOES THAT MAKE U COMPLICIT?
But you'll sleep soundly on a bed made of cash taken from the NRA right? What are Nevadans worth exactly?
So vote NO on the GUN SILENCER LAW for starters
No good guy with a gun was able to stop this bad guy with a gun. So what's the next move?
There is no next move.
Or at least nothing they're willing to do and that's the reality.
Maybe instead of praying you should stop taking money from the gun lobby and do something real to stop it.
You can rot in hell @SenDeanHeller   You love your damn guns and the money NRA gives you.
Stop taking money from the NRA.
I love waking up Monday morning and having to mark myself, "Safe." Thank your party and your Congressional buddies for me.
Hey Dean Heller, I bet that check from the NRA doesn't look so great now, does it? Keep promoting their terrorism. Hope it was worth it.
Thanks for the predictable "prayers," but how about some sensible gun control?
even more impacted if health care is yanked..remember that
Nice basic statement.  Now go vote for gun silencers for the mentally disturbed like the NRA wants you to.
Wow, you progressives can't wait to look for excuse to take guns. People are hangin on and you already are beating the drums! #Usefulidiots
Stop being reactive with prayers, start being proactive w/gun control-no automatic guns!  2nd A protection?  No machine guns in 1770’s
this was a horrifying act of violence. AUTOMATIC guns on the street of Vegas, courtesy of one of ur biggest donors -> NRA
Save your prayers. They're not working. Get to work instead and ban assault weapons. Stop accepting funds from NRA gun lobby. #GunContolNow
Senator - you voted AGAINST BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS. How does this align with your intent on that?
Don't act like you are powerless.  Stand up to the NRA & do something about assault weapons.  And start by keeping silencer ban this week.
My friend's niece has a fragmented bullet in her spine. When are you going to prevent this from happening again by growing one?
How many  "GUN RIGHTS" legislation have you crafted?  HOW MUCH NRA MONEY DO YOU NEED?  YOUR prayers won't help the families slaughtered
If only we had someone in congress that could provide sensible legislation to keep this from happening. Stuff your prayers.
Praying is not enough!!! Do something about gun violence. Need stronger control. This terrorist had 10 rifles in room. Nevada bleeds.
Do something worthwhile and start #guncontrol now.  No #AK47 no #semiautomatic weapons Mainly #Republicans want for #freedom.  Just #hatred
Don't pray Senator, Draft a bill to prevent people from getting their hands on automatic weapons. #ConsienceOfAConservative
If only your prayers had any effect on the contributions you receive from the NRA and gun lobbyists. Oh well.
Prayers don't change politics. Political action changes politics. This will happen again without meaningful gun control legislation.
"Heller..voted for..amendment to prevent...BATFE...from..centralizing records of thousands of Americans' long gun purchases."
NRAendorsement
Senator Heller, you've taken $21,350 from the NRA. Fifty are dead in your home state of Nevada. Was it worth it? What did that $21k pay for?
Sen. Heller, I did some quick math for you. That's $427 per person shot dead last night. What campaign costs did that amount cover?
Your prayers mean nothing. DO SOMETHING. Start with voting NO on the silencer bill. Say NO to the @NRA
I just can't even. @realDonaldTrump please do whatever is needed to secure safety:
NO ONE should have automatic weopons. They are meant to kill as many people as possible in a short time. Where is your action on gun control
Vegas was the 273rd mass shooting this year in the US. It’s human to mourn all this killing, but monstrous to enable more of it every day. 

We can't fix this until we elect people who stand up to the gun lobby. 

Dean Heller (R-NV) enabled the shooter:
First, stop lying about praying. Secondly, prayer without works is dead. Blood is on your hands, assault weapons vote pulled the trigger.
NOW is the time for a NATIONAL DIALOGUE about gun control.  NOW!  Honor those that have died and let it not be in vain.  N.O.W
Prayers are worthless!  Gun control is not!
Laura, what proposal would have stopped this?
Sensible gun control.
What specifically?
No specifics?
Nevada is open carry - perhaps someone would have been more concerned about a man carrying 8-10 rifles into a hotel room?
@SenDeanHeller The GUN LAWS MUST BE CHANGED IT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THIS MASS MURDER IN LV. THE GUN LAW BILL FOR SILENCERS MUST BE SHOT DOWN
@SenDeanHeller  Get behind this "GUN SILENCER" BILL VOTE NO Tragedy hit Las Vegas last night with Military Guns shouldn't be in the streets!
CALL FOR GUN CONTROL NOW
Instead of praying how about doing something about this: 
Open carry concealed weapons. machine guns legal in Nevada
Another peacock exploiting a tragedy to strut about. Real sick.

Tragedies are disastarous preventable events, brought about by superior forces. GOP is the superior force. This is about greed & power.
It's not "senseless." It's the logical conclusion of your actions. 

Pray for ALL of us, lost in the hellscape of your making.
Prayers aren’t cutting it any more, Dean. Apparently God doesn’t care about gun violence any more than you do. #DoSomething
Praying for you.
You have blood on your hands.  Prey about that!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
What does it take for you to call it terrorism?  Brown skin?
I am sure if he had stricter gun laws this still would have happened...don't you Senator?
Gun control!
Maybe you should try to do something that’s more effective than praying
Will you support gun control now? If not, just delete your tweet and retract your statement. They are meaningless.
Prayers are useless. You seem to be a big fan of guns - way to go!
"act of violence" "act of cowardice". Not an "act of terror" because the killer was not Muslim or an illegal alien? Hmmm
