Heller celebrates people losing healthcare and suffering @GovSandoval says NO
You have your nose so deep in Sheldon's ass you can't smell the Death of GOP = Greedy Old Pricks party
You're supposed to wish people a happy and healthy New Year. But that isn't possible if you vote for the bill you haven't read. #Shameonyou
@RosenforNevada @Lawrence Vote Out All @SenateGOP @HouseGOP that Keep Attacking Americans November 2018! @DeanHeller @SenTedCruz @JeffFlake
Aw-MANE.
I won't be able to have a happy new year if I can't afford healthcare coverage for my or my family's preexisting conditions. Please vote no!
Reject the horrible Trumpcare health bill
Vote your conscience--not Adelson's.
And shut down Planned Parenthood
Here is Heller lying to NV residents on June 23 http://slate.me/2s50A1r 
In celebration stripping healthcare, allowing states to charge for preexisting, and lifetime caps. Absolutely disgraceful ask our governor.
How can anyone have a happy anything when they know their healthcare is gonna be ripped away from them? @SenDeanHeller U lack moral compass!
Gotta get that Sheldon money!
HYPOCRITE! LIAR!! How DARE YOU! There will be NO HEALTHY, SWEET NEW YEAR BECAUSE OF YOU!MILLIONS LOSE, 1000s WILL DIE!Human Suffering on YOU
Do what the majority want for heavens sake. Vote NO on the ghastly GC bill.
Disgustingly empty tweet. You are in the gutter, long ago lost the moral high ground. Thousands of Nevadans will NOT have a happy New Year
Shame on you and @SenateGOP!  Taking away health coverage from 32M Americans will kill people.  Nevadans will vote you out #hellerout2018 
not Jewish, but I love kosher food and Cantor's! Have a blessed one!
And may you repent your fucking brains out this Yom Kippur (however in vain) for supporting this loathsome bill. Boobie.
It's no mitzvah to vote for the GC bill. Don't vote for this and think you can atone for it.
Sen.Heller,ths is a hallow sentiment because you support the GrahamCassidyBill wh will take insurance from your most vulnerable constituents
Liar. https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1713309898700493/ …
Go to hell, you craven piece of crap. You think you can make up for taking healthcare away from millions of people by wishing Shanah Tovah??
Heller said Repub Governors must sign off- @GovSandoval rejects your garbage bill- so that is a NO!
oh, and sorry about you losing your healthcare!    suckers!
As you vote to kil health ins to millions including the disabled and children. And you call yourself a Christian?
  empty words .  how can you celebrate a new year if you are sick + don't have affordable healthcare.  #dirtydeanheller

JUST OUT: Under Graham Cassidy ACA repeal...

-a 31% cut to Medicaid for kids
-a 15% cut for ppl w/ disabilities…
The New Year will only be worth celebrating for millions of your fellow citizens if you vote "NO" on the disasterous Graham-Cassidy bill.
Find your courage and stand up to pressure to vote for this disastrous healthcare plan.  Trump is manipulating all of you!!
Happy new year to your future unemployment.
Why are you taking away healthcare and hurting so many in NV? Not good, get ready for retirement!
Mine would be a lot better if you didn't stab us in the back with Healthcare
No on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Thank you. Now make it an even happier new year by withdrawing your new health care bill. It's going to make many people unhappy & unhealthy
#GrahamCassidyBill  is wrong and you know it.
Children and their elderly parents or grandparents suffer. You want people to have to struggle to even pay for insurance. You're a fraud.
If you have your way, they won't have a good year. You and your cronies want to kick millions off their health insurance and make their 1/2
Celebrate by voting no on the healthcare bill!!!!
You're A very EVIL man!
Vote him out in 2018

I guess if you live elsewhere, your year can suck. Our new nationalist country.
You supported an anti-Semite for president
Have a Happy New Year with out healthcare. What is wrong with you Dean?
You know what we're going to say, right? It can't be very happy if we have no health insurance.
Won't be wishing your constituents good health in this new year will you? you're a spineless coward
Your happy to kick millions off healthcare. You and everyone else who supports this horrible new bill will be voted out. Take names folks.
My mother, your constituent, would have had to pay $142,000 more EVERY YEAR to treat her cancer under your "plan"!  Wtf is wrong with you?
Show you have a backbone AND integrity! Do NOT support this Graham/Cassidy that WILL KILL AMERICANS!  Support of a STUPID promise is idiocy!
Thank you now let's hope and pray that the New Year brings more health coverage for all, not less. Vote No on #GrahamCassidy #putkids1st
How can anyone celebrate when you are co-sponsoring a bill that guts federal healthcare $ to NV? You are a traitor
Avalere study means GOP Senators now know exactly what they're voting for, even without CBO score:

http://wapo.st/2faIUO9  
Your health care bill is going to eliminate coverage for some celebrating Rosh Hashanah, any atonement for that? #Hellercare
Oppose the Graham-Cassidy Bill

You are a BAD PERSON. Trying to wish us va happy holiday while taking away a basic right to health care. 
Spineless vile human being.
What Graham-Cassidy will do to people with pre-existing conditions, an issue long thought untouchable, is simply reprehensible.
Vote no on the Graham/Cassidy bill!!!
You need to atone for your sins against humanity in honor of this holiday. Constituents please pray!  His actions killing us!@KeithOlbermann
Thank you and for the NEW YEAR... save ACA! #SavetheACA
Follow Gov Sandoval's lead Senator.  Show some spine and vote against this abomination of a bill. Do right by Nevadans
NO NO NO on trumpcare.  Just vote No. Stand up for what is right.
Time to say GoodBye!! you have SOLD-OUT nevadans for ?????
Still planning on voting to screw Nevadans on health care dean?  Why can't you listen to what we are saying on this issue? #GoodbyeDean2018
NO to #GrahamCassidy!  American wants govt to work bi partisan, fix ACA like RomneyCare   Shanah Tovah
May you have a healthy year, but I won't help you
Evergreen.
How is a "happy" New Year possible without a HEALTHY one?  #GrahamCassidy
Anyone know how to say"This healthcare bill will KILL poor people" in Yiddish?
Your health care repeal is awful.
This is a day of atonement - you are voting to kill americans - VOTE NO G-C/Bill.  Shame on you!
Are you excited for your second chance to screw over 32 million Americans (& rest of us) by voting for Cassidy bill to repeal Obamacare?
Weasel thinks to himself "I am a good man."
#GrahamCassidyDeathBill vote no
how many Nevadans are you killing this year?
No repeal of healthcare and no tax package that only benefits the wealthy. Shalom.
Your hollow platitudes mean nothing when you choose to hurt millions for political gain. Screw you and screw Graham Cassidy. #DIRTYGOP
