Disabled veterans too, will suffer under the Health Care Bill
Not only that but look at what Draft Dodger Trump is trying to do to Vietnam Disabled Vets! http://www.amvets.org/amvets-deeply-concerned-presidents-proposed-cuts-veteran-benefits/ …
Yes, take away health benefits. He only thinks of himself & rich comrades
Yawn, this is so old. Did you even read the bill? Obviously not
It cuts Medicare expansion by 12 billion dollars for a 33 billion dollar tax cut.
Do sick children deserve help?
They're literally trying to cull the herd
Of the sick, addicted, mentally ill, and poor
It is
Stunningly cruel
All to give themselves more $
a far better bill than obamacare was & it's fiscally sound. Trump was right, it could be the gold star healthcare & you libs would complain
amazed you don't want to be fiscally responsible.Are we to continue the debt spiral of Obama? New healthcare plan is a good one. Vote yes
The new healtcare bill includes medicaid, it just doesn't include any new increases in Medicaid, so why haven't you signed It?
Stop putting party over people
But then he's screwing them over with the health-care bill 

Voted down helping the veterans 7X
Just because  Democrats penned the bill
Oh now Republicans are voting for it when it's your bill

America remember how they voted down veterans help every time a Dem brought it up
If you cared about the VA why did you vote down the last seven VETRANS bills
because the Democrats wrote them

No party over people
TrumpCare is the greatest attack on Americans that Nevada has ever had. 23 million will lose health insurance so wealthy get a tax cut.
Why don't you check the facts and stop being biased. Time for you to become an American and stop following the politicians.
I'm an American citizen. Your comment ("become American") is the most un-American thing I've heard today. Shameful.
You don't act like it, Americans check their facts before spreading false narrative, support their Presidents, and help to heal rifts.
Like you did with President Obama?
The "birther in chief" actually questioned whether President Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump's the most divisive potus in history. Sad!
I question it as well. However, I wouldn't think of being an advocate of violence towards a sitting President like Dems are. That is wrong!
You question President Obama was born in the USA? He was born in Hawaii. Trump hired an investigator to go to Hawaii. Where's the findings?

Would love to hear Republican Senators explain why they're voting for a bill that triples premiums for middle-class seniors. https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/879437160365084672 …
Are you referring to President Obama who started all of this?
NOW WHY NOT DO SOMETHING FOR HIM SUPPORT HIM ON R & R NOBAMACARE
Half a million veterans will lose their Medicaid benefits. #Deathcare

Nonpartisan CBO confirms: Senate bill would have a crushing impact on Americans, leaving 22 million more people uninsured by 2026. #CBOScore
Fix the ACA with the democrats
Please vote NO. Your vote would mean my husband will be able to get the surgery he needs. If he loses ACA he will be forced to live in agony
How many RT's for you to vote NO on #TrumpCare? 
This isn't reality tv- Vets, kids, elderly shouldn't be kept in suspense on life or death!
Now we need a bill to bring more accountability for the people we voted in office.
Vote NO ON WEALTHCARE
Please vote no on this murderous healthcare bill and save my fellow nurses and our patients thousands of hospitals will close
VOTE NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great for vets. Thank you! Please protect your constituents (some vets) #HellerVoteNo on AHCA, please!
My 94 yr old Dad, a #WWII Vet, was just told no funding available to help him, that maybe more would open up in October.  Need is now.
Enjoy it cuz when we lose senate in 2018 because you & 7 other senators voted no on the HC bill, POTUS agenda is full stop.
Don't even You need to be changing your mind over Holiday or bad things will be coming your way
Let's bring the same accountability to how we treat our poor, disabled, and elderly family members on Medicaid, who will die without it
Thank you for your bipartisan record.
How about you help our country by backing @POTUS as it pertains to #RepealObamacare. We need you to get on board.
Are you listening to these people Dean?
But you somehow find it necessary to oppose improving health care. I voted for you maybe that was a mistake
Also, you guys need to pony up some funds. GOP keeps decreasing overall funds and prgms. You can't keep MDs cuz they get paid better outside
There needs to be more accountability and make is easier to fire ALL govt employees, not just VA.
Thank you
Now why don't you sign p. Trumps healthcare bill. Anthem just said it will help the healthcare market. Who else do you need to talk to
Kaiser Family Foundation said Senate bill would result in significant increases to the cost of non-group coverage and medical care.
Solution. Get rich and you can have s tax cut too. The American Dream. Right?
Great. Now he's bashing you for not liking this horrible healthcare plan he's pushing. Stay strong! Vote NO!

#TrumpCare is a shameless shift of money from the poor to the rich.
Re: Health.  Talk about care NOT tax cuts.
please vote no on wealthcare.  the bill is highly unpopular and will be especially cruel to the disabled and the elderly.
Senator Heller you have lost my vote unless you reverse your decision on healthcare.
