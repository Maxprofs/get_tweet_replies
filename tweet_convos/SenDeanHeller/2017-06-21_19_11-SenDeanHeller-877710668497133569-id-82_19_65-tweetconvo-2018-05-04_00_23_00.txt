I always get voicemail. Look at it objectively, this a mean bill and Nevadans know it.... you know it

By telephone ???
I expect you to stand with the President. Don't blow this opportunity.
People above party. I guess you don't understand the welfare of America is more important than a small political win that is bad.
Please vote YES on the AHCA.
Anyone who has read the new bill knows it will cost more, cover less.
Only idiots would vote for "full repeal and replace". The educated constituents know the ACA needs improvement. This new bill is worse.
Isn't Las Vegas in Nevada?
VOTEHELLEROUT2018
We have no choice, Heller follows Trump in lockstep. 
Time for a rep who cares for all of NV
When is the actual in-person town hall? You may want to hear your constituents thoughts on healthcare before you vote.
I agree. Please don't cave to the millions spent by dems on commercials against the bill. They don't represent the majority.
I'm a dem, but I admire your work and Character...thank you!
Vote out in 2018. Out all republicans
Maybe do a town hall where more of your constituents live?  Like Las Vegas or Reno?  @townhallproject #VoteNoAHCA
Please don't let them ram the healthcare bill through without input from the people it affects. Be our hero.
Or an economist or five, or public health experts, nurses, doctors, pharmacists, health systems, hospitals, or women.  #HellerVoteNo
Let this cold hearted jerk know that you will vote him out in large numbers if he dares to vote for a bill that will kill old, poor, sick.
CLARK COUNTY! Why are you avoiding 70% of ur constituents?
WTH is a telephone town hall? My God you really do live in a bubble. I suppose not 1 question was asked about AHCA? Well let me ask, yes/no?
He can't answer questions about something that's not completed.
So it's being held secret from him too?  He like everyone should be having a say in what goes into this. NOT just 13 people.
No that's a Democrate game.
Yeah because a year of public hearings was "held secret". Thanks for being part of the problem.
So just how much say did we have about the un-read ACA. Socialist crap.
Obamacare focuses on redundant forms and paperwork not people.   Offers no choice and   Unnafordable
#HellerVoteNo #RESISTANCE
Doing more, like actually showing up sometimes?
Senator Heller, please protect our neighbors and vote against Medicaid cuts.
I just got booted from tonight's town hall. How do I get reconnected?
PLEASE Vote NO!  SAVE AMERICA!
Something tells me you are not looking forward to it at all.
@SenDeanHeller These are not public meetings if you issue only private invitations and there are no notes or transcripts of what was said.
How about in Clark county ?
Kiss your job goodbye Dean
Back to CA with you ya fuckin' carpetbagger
https://twitter.com/chuckcbpp/status/877914633541046272 â€¦  this looks like it's a pretty bad deal for the people of nv, but then the Koch's want their tax cut.
For working class in WV, AR, NV & AK, is it more important to be able to go to the doctor or to cut taxes on top 400? For their Senators? 

Ummm, enough w the screened and scripted town hall "meetings!" Are you going to vote no on taking healthcare away from tens of millions?
Did you talk about the health care bill before the senate. Please  tell us what you think. It would be refreshing.
Hiding in your safe space?  #DoYourJob #VoteHellerOut
@SenDeanHeller I am asking you to vote NO on the health care bill!Can you  live w/ urself if u took away ins from the ones who need it most?
What about the urban areas where most of the people live? Still having secret phone conversations and not facing your constituents
#Tww
Too chicken to meet us face to face? Yes, thats what I thought. What part of "IN PERSON TOWN HALL" do you not understand?
P.S.  Defund Planned Parenthood while you're at it!  #MAGA
Repeal & Replace Obama care.  See how easy that was. Don't need an in-person town hall for #LeftWingNuts to bully you. #MAGA
NO ON TRUMPCARE
Why are we paying all you politicians to act like petulant, spoiled children? Grow up and interact across the aisle.
NO on AHCA and the shameful way it has been kept to only GOP. Needs to be vetted by all to be palatable. You all need to work together.
I can't find any notice about a telephone town hall meeting - is it invitation only? Aren't these open to the public? Please post.
There are HUNDREDS of nonstop flights every month from IAD and BWI to LAS when can I expect to meet my Senior Senator in person? Save #ACA 
Would you like to share how you pick the participants for your "fake" town halls? Transcripts would be nice too
Do not vote to cut womens care, to make children less healthy, to stop teenagers from getting pregnant by taking away their care.
Me too. Also looking forward to your thoughts on the shameful bill being written in private to take affordable healthcare from millions.
Called #GOPLackOfCare
Did you tell them about the health care bill?
Why should we care? You don't care to invite us!
Another telephone town hall? WTF? Is there a transcript? Total BS! All ur constituents deserve  2 know ur stance on AHCA. 
#ResistTrumpcare
Did u tell them the truth about #TrumpCare? It will result in rural hospitals closing down and hurt vets (two constituencies you prioritize)
"Telephone town hall"? 
COWARD!
#HellerHatesNevada 
#HellerHatesNevadans
#2018VoteHellerOut #HellerLovesLobbyistMoney
You seem legitimately afraid to actually face your constituency... doesn't bode well for reelection
Remember us down here in So. NV? Vote NO on the HC bill that was underhandedly and sneakily put together by the GOP. TY.
bbbbrrrrrttttt
How many people did you have muted, and how many staffers joined in to toss you softball questions?
Odd you didn't mention the "telephone town hall" on twitter until it was over, and don't reveal substance.  What did u say about #Trumpcare?
Talked about #WealthCare for billionaires NOT #GOPLackOfCare, #DeathGrip, handouts to big pharma. Missed you last night in front of office
Servile "Don't boo" Heller, only able to do telephone townhalls,eager to vote for Trumpcare, denying PParenthood funding,decimating Medicaid
No AHCA
Would like you to vote no on ACHA. Sincerely your constituent.
Doing more town halls so you can listen to our needs and do nothing?
Not a town hall.
So are you going to vote on #taxcutahca
Please hold an in person townhall. Every time I hear about telephone town halls it comes as a surprise cu I'm never invited.No on AHCAplease
2/2 Do not vote along party lines. Vote NO on the AHCA and stand up for your state and its people. Listen to us. Please.
I can't wait for a NO vote on this horrible healthcare bill from the Senate. Otherwise #EnjoyYourLastTerm
#VoteForTheManyNotTheFew
1/2 When will you address the AHCA? When will you address the cuts to PP and Medicaid? When will you finally listen to Nevadans?
Remember Georgia. Decent working people are not polling on the phone (we block calls).  We work so don't protest all day.
If you actually showed up in person a few people might actually respect you. As it stands you really are the weakest GOP senator.
Did you let them know if you are going to vote to cut their Medicaid, close their hospitals, raise premiums & reduce coverage?
To be fair, premiums may go down - at least for healthy young people - because policies will not be required to cover essential benefits
To be fair, billionaires will be better able to afford plastic surgery, with the money they get, taken from poor, middle class, old & sick
I agree 100% #TrumpCare is a tax cut for rich at expense of needy. Was just pointing out that it could lower premiums by cutting benefits
How bout showing up in person?!
Let's go visit his office and see if he's man enough to meet constituents
please vote NO to #Wealthcare amirite @jonlovett ????
Good one. Goes with #GOPLackOfCare
did you promise to protect the healthcare of your constituents rather than give a tax break to the rich?
