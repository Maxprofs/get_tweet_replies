Another reason to get rid of this sleaze ball

Thanx!!!

Just read that Slate article about you and McConnell.  Outrageous.

Fraud!
So this is the price of your soul, Senator. Good to know.
You are a Sell Out @DeanHeller ! Your Votes are Paid for by Russian Thug Putin, @SenateMajLdr & @realDonaldTrump ! Vote Out @GOP Hate 2018

Oh my...Dean Heller's reward for caving to Trump on health care? A million dollars from Mitch McConnell. http://amp.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/04/dean_heller_caved_on_health_care_vote_gets_million_plus_from_mcconnell.html …
No backbone you caved
What about the VA Formulary! Medicare, Medicaid, PPACA all have better prescription drugs available to them, especially more modern drugs!!!
I see you updated YOUR funding formula by $1M.  Was it worth it to sell out to Mitch ?
can't believe you sold out your voters' healthcare for a crappy million bucks.
Crook...
Is this for all veterans ?? Or just the ones orange agent tells you to support #voteNoDHeller2018
No one can trust you when you're a sniveling coward that backed down to the lamest threat from Donald. Backing @RosenforNevada
U got bought by Mitch!!' You are gone! U don't give a damn about your constituents or the country Money over ethics ! You are one POS liar!
This is a letter Heller sent me. He says he voted to repeal WITHOUT a replacement. Scum doesn't care if there is no safety net
This letter he sent me. Explaining his position which is screw everyone else. Replace DEAN HELLER - Jacky Rosen will be his competitor
Don't worry. Your support of repealing ACA instead of fixing it can kill off the disabled/seniors/poor so more housing available for vets.
Are you a member of the "problem solver caucus"  ?
SIGN PETITION TO REMOVE @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenDeanHeller @SenJohnMcCain - they betrayed @POTUS
My dad gets dental, Korean War, my cousin might as well own stock in aspirin he was peacetime. He followed orders also. Not his fault no war
What about dental for ALL Veterans? They were ALL willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for us they shouldn't be in pain!
Since when do you care about people in Nevada??!! #hellerout2018
I'm a Veteran,  you think i believe  anything you say?  It's OBVIOUS  you have sold out. You are so gone.  
Bye, bye
#hellerout2018
They dont trust him..
2018 is coming. Your healthcare vote is gonna cost you.
While you’re calculating, why don’t you figure out how market forces will solve healthcare when the sickest people are too sick to shop.
Yippy. So brave, doing good for veterans.  Next .......puppy foundation?

you lost all credibility when mitch mcconnell easily bought your vote to throw millions off healthcare for money.  #dirtydeanheller   
Dean u r walking a thin thread for 2018 u were voted in by Republicans not Democrats.
Hoping you will support the new common sense immigration bill.   You'd better get behind Trump and support him.
Why should veterans trust you when you stabbed Nevadans on Medicaid in the back?
Hang it up, Dean. You're waffling performance during the healthcare debate has exposed you as a malleable politician.
Dirty Dean! Say goodbye to your senate seat!
And you must update your leadership and fiduciary duty formulas to support Nevada, its citizens, your constituents. #WeWillRemember #2018
