SenHeller,The Vets are among th most vulnerable Ppl who will be devastatd by your supprt of http://GrahamCassidyBill.You  are NOT helping our Vets
You know what helps decrease suicide? Access to mental healthcare that is affordable. Your bill will harm those efforts. #SavetheACA
@MihaellaS27 @TWWNevada @IndivisibleReno if passed, there would be zero debate & sent directly to house. Please make those calls, vote no.
your killer and liar let NV  down no more  step down now or quit  you never win again  money From  rich people not help you no more
And Graham's crap healthcare bill cuts off funding for those efforts! Vote with your not with your party please!
Dean, you will not win re-election no matter how many photo ops you take. You lied over healthcare and the voters WILL NOT Forgive You.
with tax cuts for billionaires?
If you care so much about Veterans why don't you or ANYONE from your office return phone calls from veterans in need?  You're using Veterans
This bill is not better.  Dean Heller is trying to trick you Nevada.

Nevada:  Demand Heller answer these questions about the bill he is sponsoring!!
#ACA Important questions to have answered re. #GrahamCassidy #KillTheBill #SaveACA #Obamacare #ACA #Trumpcare https://twitter.com/charles_gaba/status/909813133191065601 … 
U talk out of both sides, Heller.  Better decide which one you're on.  Either way, see you in '18 - and don't expect it to be pretty.
Parasite...
MANY negative implications for veterans' health in Graham-Cassidy, including 
less care for vet suicide prevention
So why does the Acting Director for the VA in San Juan remove a psychiatrist from patient care to run the choice program!
And you think the best way to deal is to rip away Healthcare from millions of people? Gross.
SO DON'T CUT THE FUCKING HEALTHCARE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!!

This is nice, However when the doctor in Pahrump started yelling at patients he put into "comas" they need to work harder at it.
Then please do not vote for Graham Cassidy  !
#25 for #unfit

GOP hopes to ram through repeal vote before CBO figures out how many people will lose their insurance. Immoral—but also malevolently clever.
He flipped out on healthcare for also! Turncoat bastard!
Feeling extremely betrayed by your putting everything behind another Medicaid-obstructing ACA repeal-replace. 
Will hurt many to help a few.
Senator, your governor opposes, but you do not. What about your stating you would only back if Gov Sandoval supports? I remember this well.
Who needs to commit suicide when Dean Heller will do the job for you.  PIGhttps://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1713309898700493/
Screwing veterans is not a smart political move... FYI.
#MedicareForAll
My brother's a veteran. You are taking his mental health care...
Except your support of Cassidy-GrahamTrumpcare would be be bad for Vets.  Hypocrite.
New name, same mess.

This vet, of @VoteVets, explains why #GrahamCassidy is such a disaster for veterans' healthcare: 
Women vets commit suicide 6x the rate of men vets.
Nice photo op. If you gave a damn for vets you'd oppose #GrahamCassidy, not co-sponsor it. You are a hypocrite.
My brother was born w/ a birth defect & died b4 ACA was in place. He couldn't get nor afford insur. &was afraid to go to dr. Water on brain.
Did you not lie about what you would do about the health care bill the last time? Lying is the norm now. And now you plan to make it worse!

The #GrahamCassidy bill uninsures millions & is no solution. On behalf of Americans (& your career), this cannot go forward. #SaveACA

Trump hasn't mentioned #GrahamCassidy. They haven't gone to media to talk about it. They learned from past mistakes.

This is a HUGE threat. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/909214838768971776 …
Stop trying to take our healthcare away!!!!




This vet rhetoric has to stop
Vote this guy out next year.
Oh we will don't worry
And privatizing VA is certainly NOT the way to do it. My husband lives in Carson City & his care is excellent. #HandsOffVA
This veteran front must stop. What are you hiding behind all this vet stuff ? Single payer healthcare option is on the table!

The ACA is the best healthcare I've ever had. First time I've ever had eye care and dental care. The peace of mind of having it is priceless
Graham/Cassidy/Heller/Johnson appears to allow states to let insurers charge you more $$$ if your child was born with a birth defect.

Still nothing on your co-sponsoring the #GrahamCassidy healthcare bill that uninsures millions and desecrates coverage.
Deflect and deny. We know that you are a co-sponsor of the Graham Cassidy Bill to repeal the ACA. Your senate seat is gone in 2018.
Will you be a traitor to the people of the US @DeanHeller and be responsible for taking away our healthcare? We WILL vote in 2018.
Then why are U for #cutting #funding for our #veterans? It's time for you 2 #resign, if not the #voters of #Nevada will do it for you #Vegas
Jobs and a reason to wake up.  Stop doctors from giving opiates like common street cartels.  (It's not rocket science).
GOOD JOB!
LOSER!  Why are you trying to take away health from NV citizens. You are a tool of the casino moguls. You know who and so do we.
You shouldn't choose the give healthcare to some and cut it for others. That's not leadership, it's cowardice.
New plan cuts Medicare too.  Scumbag behavior
How much money did it take for u to figure that one out?....you are TOOOOOOOL!
.they need healthcare u consistently vote against healthcare ur bill cuts out preexisting conditions #nosenate4uin18
Then why do u want 2 take away h-care from needy vets & others? Graham-Cassidy bill cuts billions in fed $ to NV
