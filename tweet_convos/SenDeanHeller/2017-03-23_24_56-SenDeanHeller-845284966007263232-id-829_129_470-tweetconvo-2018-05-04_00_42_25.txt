Oh, you mean like how you did? #hypocrite
It is called 'The Biden Rule'
This coming from a bot!
i think you meant #Garland there. careful what you put out there, it comes back like a boomerang. #nogorsuch #resist
Merrick Garland deserved that also, and @POTUS is under FBI investigation!!!!! No appointments until investigation complete
Do you ever see a reply to one of  your comments & in reply simply want to type "Moron" ?? I'm seeing a few of those today.
yes and then you look at the profile and you know they only joined Twitter to follow their leader and troll with misspelled words
*smile* I hope misspelled words isn't the nail-in-the-coffin - I seem to misspell a lot on twiter *smile*
MERRICK. GARLAND. You really think we forgot about that?!
Biden Rule...you think we forgot about that?!
I urge you @SenateMajLdr @SenDeanHeller to OPPOSE the confirmation of #Gorsuch
I urge your colleagues to show Judge #Gorsuch the same amount of consideration as they did Merrick #Garland.
Like you showed Judge Garland? Your hypocrisy is boundless.
The Biden Rule. Hypocrisy is boundless...
There isn't a Biden Rule., it was a remark. And I disagreed with Joe then also. The President nominates. The Senate holds hearings & votes.
Agreed. I just think it is insane to block one as 'payback' for blocking the other. Obstruction from both sides hurts all of us.
Kinda funny begging like this. You embarrass yourself & your lame repub party as you can't govern even a rubik cube. Obstructionists still.
As soon as you give .@MerrickGarland_ the fair considered he deserved.
Like the fair consideration you showed to Merrick Garland?-what a hypocrite
@SenateMajLdr will you please start acting like Republicans won the last election and complete Trumps agenda.
I think I'll pass on having Putin's proxy make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.  Thanks anyway. #NoGorsuch
The fairness you didn't show Garland. #NoGorsuch pick a moderate judge and Dems will vote for him/her. Constituents say no to Gorsuch.
@SenDeanHeller laughable coming from both of you.
This is so laughably hypocritical. #MerrickGarland
what goes around comes around. why should Gorsch be given consideration with trump under FBI investigation?
Let's conclude the #Trumprussia investigation before anyone is seated by THIS president. We cannot allow #PutinsPuppet to pick anyone
POTUS under investigation of FBI stop trying to jam through appointees before conclusion of collusion is found. #noGorsuch
Simply put, NO! HELLS NO!!!
LOL, really?  #merrickgarland
You denied #Garland a hearing. Now you expect support for #Gorsuch? It's not about Gorsuch. It's about you. You are not a good man.
#MerrickFirst
This is GARLAND'S seat. Your total disrespect towards him & Pres Obama is where this began so you really do not have a leg to stand on.
Please, America needs Judge Gorsuch.
Go straight to hell.
you need to listen to your constituents #NoGorsuch 2018 is coming #wearewatching #yourefired if you refuse the will of the people #resist
Since it is the last year of Trump's presidency, no scotus vote should be held. Fair is fair, Senator Mitch.
Fair? You need to grab a dictionary. If D were "fair" they wouldn't even entertain your ludicrous remarks muchless your SCOTUS suggestions.
NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope we see you behind bars soon.
No friggin' way, you POS! You gave #MerrickGarland ZERO consideration. You're trying to steal this seat! No Dem should help you or #Gorsuch
I'd urge your colleagues to do the opposite of what you do, for the good of the nation.
No votes until ind investigation of '16 election. Garland was denied for far less.
yes, investigate Dem vote fraud & Obama spying on DJT.
Rs are in charge, they can investigate anything. But because claims have no merit, to do so would be embarassing
many R's are RINOs.  Hate Trump love Dems & don't want to embarrass the Uniparty. They are swamp creatures
Then why do their R constituents vote for them if they are such frauds in the real world and not just your mind?
because most voters assume RINOs support Republican values because they call themselves Republicans.
but not the enlightened ones, like you, who know anything besides health care for none/a dead planet = surrender
your Tweet is incoherent, like your thought processes.
I urge you to urge your colleagues to show #Garland the fair consideration he deserves & come together... yawn #SCOTUS
Like the fair consideration you showed #MerrickGarland I don't support Gorsuch.
@SenDeanHeller Nevadans say "NO" to Gorsuch.
@SenDeanHeller fair Sir? You held up a nomination for almost 300 days. Now you wish fairness? 
@SenDeanHeller Vote No on Gorsuch he is not the right choice. Especially since he has been so evasive in his hearings.
@SenDeanHeller he is bias and apparently hates women. Vote no
DEMS never will but they stand together, Republicans don't. They cower and need to STOP. Go nuclear, call their bluff NOW.
U r wrong and People are #nogorsuch b/c he is a corp shill & @potus under FBI invest should not appoint #resist
Are you talking about Merrick Garland?
Um "fair consideration"... Merrick Garland #karma
Like you did for judge Garland?
they didn't when u tried to ram and force the joke of trumpcare down everyone throat as a Republican we need another Senateldr
GOLLY! he doesn't answer any questions! Even a navy pilot gets to walk away from broken plane to safe his life! Blows it up!
2018 is just around the corner.  NV will remember.
@SenDeanHeller no way. You don't deserve any respect. No Scotus pick while under investigation.
@SenDeanHeller  I'd urge the Senate to show judge Garland the fair consideration he deserves & give him a hearing
It is my sincere hope that you will postpone Judge Gorsuch's hearings, because of the criminal invest. of the Trump campaign.
OMG Mitch! Remember Garland? #hypocrisy
As fair, say, as denying Merrick Garland during Obama's admin w/a phony excuse? Gorsuch is a corporatist. NG4NV
Judge Gorsuch is not good for women nor this country. Once again you stand with the money people and not NV
Please show some balls. It appears that Schumer controls the Senate and just on principle you should force through the N/O
@SenDeanHeller show him the same fair consideration as Merrick B. Garland got!      Corrupt @GOP    #SCOTUS
Why? You broke the rules and now you expect Dems to follow them. Filibuster.
#DELAYCONFIRMATION of #Gorsuch until more info on #TrumpRussiaCollusion. He will always have an * otherwise! We r watching!!
PRETTY SOON U AND YOUR COLLEAGUES WILL B IN JAIL FOR TREASON, PARTY BEFORE COUNTRY
You obstructed the last nominee and now have this nominee from our #treasonous President. NO! #unpresidented
steamroller the Democrats. They would do it to u if given a chance. Also investigate Obamagate spying on DJT.
I would urge you to make #MakeAmericaAmericaAgain by impeaching @POTUS for Treason
#MerrickGarland
the same as ya'll showed Garland
.@SenateMajLdr 
Just like you did for Merrick Garland?
#Hypocrite
As I write this, The original posting has 783 replies with many in dissent and only 465 hearts. #NoGorsuch yes #MerrickGarland
@DeanHeller Then give #MerrickGarland his rightful vote. Trump's campaigning, already. #NoGorsuch bad for women and Americans.
Your hypocrisy  has no bounds at all. Almost unbelievable !? But you have had years of putting your own power above all else!
Absolutely! Just like how you & fellow GOP members showed your support for Merrick Garland right? Hypocrisy!
Like you gave Garland?
What about Merrick Garland? You never gave him a fair shot. Hypocrite
@SenDeanHeller Just like the fairness and consideration you gave Judge Garland. Sickening. #Craven
Where were you when Garland deserved fair consideration.
@rodger_sutton I agree. Judge Gorsuch is truly s good man. I was very impressed with his congressional demeanor.
The same way you did for Merrick? Not for this illegitimate president. I don't think so. #Hypocrite
Just like you showed Merrick Garland!
@SenDeanHeller U denied us our voice when u STOLE that seat. I DEMAND MY SENATOR VOTE NO. U TRAITORS.
@SenDeanHeller POTUS GETS NO NOT ONE APPT. THRU UNTIL FBI INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE AND HE CLEARED.  U WORK FOR US ACT LIKE IT
@SenDeanHeller absolutely NOT. TRUMP UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FOR TREASON. NO VOTE UNTIL FBI IS DONE. NO U WORK FOR US.
@SenDeanHeller Two republican hypocrites. Seat belongs to Garland!
And I urge you to vote against such a partisan pick ON A STOLEN SEAT! Remember you represent all of NV  not just republicans
@SenDeanHeller Not until an independent investigation of Trump and Russia take place. The true SCOTUS should be Judge Garland.
really? After what you did to President Obama's nominee?
and I bet you said that with a straight face too...
while Trump is under investigation?  #TrumpRussia #FakePresident #MerrickGarland should be on bench you obstructing POS
Karma. @GorsuchFacts is a victim of @GOP hypocrisy.
You all need to sit back until some truth comes to light. No to putting any judge in.
Jusge Gorsuch?  I think you mean fair consideration of Judge #Garland!  I support HIM.
Fair consideration - for Judge Garland you mean?  I certainly support fair consideration of HIM.
Like the fair consideration shown Garland by not giving him a hearing? You are the biggest hypocrite. Hope KY votes you out
@SenDeanHeller like you showed Garland? shame on you for acting like spoiled children.
Vote on Garland first. #EightIsEnough
Of course you do! You want him to continue to treat workers and women like garbage just like you do! FRAUD! RESIGN NOW!
yes I watched the Judges hearings. This man is an Excellent choice. Even though the dems tried to rattle him, it did not work
@SenDeanHeller No thank you.
@SenDeanHeller no to Gorsuch. Garland should be having hearing.
He deserves a kick in the groin for all the times he ruled against people in favor of corporations. You deserve the same.
@SenDeanHeller what's your vote on the healthcare??? Please put us first #killthebill #ProtectOurCare #voteno
I would urge you to tear up the contract that you signed with the devil. You are an embarrassment to our nation and especially Kentucky.
"Fair consideration" is not a phrase you should ever be using after you wouldn't give Merrick Garland the time of day.
if you have any moral fiber, investigate #russiagate before you talk about #SCOTUS
and yet U wouldn't "urge" Obama's nominee. You're as dishonest a politician as the stereotype indicates
says the Man that eve refused to hold a hearing of Merrick Garland....too funny
Do you ever consider how hypocritical your words sound?
you mean like the same fair consideration you gave @BarackObama pick? Dont give me some Biden rule bs either. Not a real rule
Merrick Garland much?
@SenDeanHeller guess you GUYS don't like women much do you? Gorsuch is clearly not fit to be SCJ. #womenslivesmatter #resist
BTW - we loathe you and think you're one of the most despicable figures on the face of the planet.
Do you mean like the fair consideration you showed Garland? Sorry, turtle-boy. You deserve to reap what you sow.
#VoteNoAHCA Or in 2018 you will be replaced. We the People are reclaiming our country.
@SenDeanHeller His stance against women is clear. A vote for G is a vote against all the women in your life. #resist
.@SenDeanHeller I urge my senator to be bipartisan, listen to constituents, and vote NO on Gorsuch. #GarlandNotGorsuch
After the stall on Judge Garland and the cloud of scandal over Trump any vote on Gorsuch is a mistake.
@SenDeanHeller Nominee must not be considered until independent investigation is completed.
MERRICK GARLAND!
@SenDeanHeller @SenateMajLdr excuse me? You both opposed Garland for no real reason, but now we have a president under FBI investigation!
@SenDeanHeller - NO! @POTUS under CI investigation for COLLUSION w/RUSSIA! YOU refused MERRICK GARLAND! +POTUS campaigning!
Where was your respect for a Judge Garland?
Since trump is in the last year of his presidency, he should not get to appoint a judge. Isn't that the new rule?
First let's give #MerrickGarland the fair consideration he deserves & the next time there is a vacancy, give #Gorsuch a chance
@SenDeanHeller tell them their choices are him or Ted Cruise.  They can pick their poison.
NO on GORSUCH! Heller-you'd better FILIBUSTER!
Also, your hubris is astounding.  Like we all would forget how you treated Judge Garland.
@SenDeanHeller Sen Heller.  Do Nevada proud and distance yourself from the GOP hypocrisy that is destroying this country.
@SenDeanHeller I'd urge my representatives to show Judge Garland the fair consideration he deserves and grant him a hearing.
Pause Gorsuch's hearing until FBI's Trump investigation is complete so judicial branch doesn't appear compromised as well.
@SenDeanHeller What about Garland?!
Karma sucks doesn't it Mitch. Do you have Russian ties, too?
THANK YOU!
Reply to @SenateMajLdr Like how Merrick Garland was respected? We didn't forget, Mr. Turtle
If you really think Chief Clown Schumer will be fair you need to rethink his position!!
@SenDeanHeller I agree. And he's gotten more than you gave Garland,   more than enough by your metric.  #BeatDean2018
Once again, more hypocritical blather coming from your office intern.
.@SenDeanHeller How do you justify appointing a man nominated by a prez under investigation 4 RUSSIAN collusion, no less. NO!
@SenDeanHeller not one person should be considered until AFTER GARLAND GETS HEARINGS!!
I'd urge obstructionist supreme McConnell to show Merrick Garland the fair consideration he deserved. You're a hypocrite.
Probly more consideration than u gave their nominee last year.Go on about your business of kicking disadvantaged to the curb
I'd urge you and your colleagues to consider that you didn't allow Merrick Garland to be voted on. What do you consider fair?
Like you did to Merrick Garland! Absolutely! Just. Like. That.
@SenDeanHeller fillabuster is about the only response YOU deserve. You have undermined democracy. Sit down now.
I can't wait to read your tweets after Gorsuch is confirmed: 52-48.
go away eggbot. #Gorsuch is owned by the religious right. He hasn't answered one question with transparency.
you have lost ALL credibility. Get back in your shell, turtle 
@SenDeanHeller just like you gave your other colleague and highly qualified judge #MerrickGarland? The hypocrisy is disgusting
has some nerve saying that after obstruction on Garland. #GarlandNotGorsuch
NOT until the #trumprussia & #GOPrussua ties have been fully investigated!!
@SenDeanHeller as a reminder dean @POTUS is under investigation for #Trumprussia #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia 2018
@SenDeanHeller Give him the same respect as Garland. I hate fucking hypocrites who despise the Constitution.
the same consideration you showed Obama's nomination right?
.@SenateMajLdr @SenDeanHeller even retweeting this is insulting and obtuse.  Senator Heller, you have sunk to a new low.
@SenDeanHeller the worst hypocrite in the Senate. You really did not just retwit in support of this did you. omfg dean. 2018
@SenDeanHeller senator, you're ridiculous. The trump ties to Russia aren't a disqualifying situation but being in year 8 is?
SERIOUSLY?  You successfully blocked hearings for Judge Garland.  So you can take that sentiment and shove it.
@SenDeanHeller I urge @SenateDems to show this nominee the same consideration you showed Merrick Garland.
@SenDeanHeller like you did for Judge Garland?  #hypocrisy #stolenseat
I urge McConnell to KMA. Trumprussia
.@SenateMajLdr @SenDeanHeller How about we talk about how you GUTTED Internet privacy? 

Yeah...Heller...YOU'RE FIRED!
@SenDeanHeller Really??  Merrick Garland???? This @WhiteHouse IS BEING INVESTIGATED BY FBI!! All business should STOP!!! @CNN
@SenDeanHeller I'd urge #CharlieBrown to show the same fair treatment that Lucy showed him.
If the election wasn't rigged, then why did GOP block the spot, waiting until the new president was elected. Just saying
. Keep the Judicial branch out of the hands of the alt right. #RESISTANCE
Like you did with Garland?
he deserves the same consideration Merrick Garland received!
NO SCOTUS APPTS UNTIL AFTER FBI/CIA/NSA INVESTIGATIONS ARE OVER. NO!
Garland deserved a hearing but you blocked that, POTUS is under investigation by the FBI no appointment until that's over
Go nuclear. Stop the games!
you're the 2nd biggest problem in American pols right now--history will remember you for your bigoted hateful practices!
go nuclear go nuclear go nuclear go nuclear go nuclear go nuclear
where was this "encouragement" for Garland. You reap what you sow.
you don't know what fair is.  Hypocritical GOP
no
time for the nuclear option!
@SenSchumer @SenWarren @SenFranken @HouseDemocrats Please put a muzzle on this self serving GOP Hypocrite.
you mean like you did to the feller that the black guy nominated?
Do as I say not as I do.  Merrick Garland ring a bell?
That's kinda rich coming from the #ObstructinistRingLeader  #StolenSeat
Oh you mean like the fair consideration you showed #MerrickGarland ? #shutupmitch
you're nothing if not brimming with #Irony
like you did?? You are such a worm!
the same could have been said for Mr Merrick Garland. How about try just try working for ALL AMERICANS!
You are, indeed, a psychopath.
your plea is laughable--especially in how you handled #Garland
The word "fair" sounds odd coming out of your mouth, Mitch. You and your wife are the corruption this country can do without.
