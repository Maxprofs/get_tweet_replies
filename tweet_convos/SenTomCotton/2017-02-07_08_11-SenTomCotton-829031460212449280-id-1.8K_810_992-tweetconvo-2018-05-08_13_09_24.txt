@sendavidperdue It also has some of the least qualified and ethically-challenged nominees since President Washington.
@RepTrentFranks We're still waiting for the Nukes n Weed report you promised @briannarcnn What happened? Did ur dog eat it?
It's like the Pot calling the Kettle Black #ConfirmGarland
everything about that is bullshit
because crying about obstruction isn't full of rank hypocrisy. 

Special Snowflakes indeed.
@RepTrentFranks How about the time YOU AND FELLOW REPUBLICANS DID NOT EVEN CONSIDER OBAMA'S NOMINEE! THAT WAS LAST YEAR!!!!
@SenateMajLdr Funny how you forgot about Merrick Garland
Just like you really did anything about Obama's supreme court nominee.  Hypocrites.  Sad for our country
And this is the most historically unqualified cabinet to ever be nominated. Length of time argument is failed logic.
Oh? Please do explain how this cabinet is unqualified in the slightest. No memes or biased "news" allowed.
http://wpo.st/6tv_2  -List @ Bottom. Openly hostile to depts nominated to run; no experience in field.
That hostility is what makes these nominations so great... They want to actually fix them.
No they don't. They want to dismantle them.
Sometimes, one must take something apart to put it back together properly. This is one of those times.
The problem is that she knows nothing about the department of education or education policy.
That's rich considering you made @POTUS44 wait for confirmations. The current clown in charge takes
weekends off and flies to Florida, on OUR dime. Most of his cabinet picks  inexperienced in Govt.
The GOP wrote the book on obstructionism, so don't complain when the other side is playing by your rules
are you kidding me?!  After how Republicans behaved during Obama's tenure down to refusing the hear Garland?!
@SenThomTillis maybe if u cared about future u would be "obstructing" too.
STOP OBSTRUCTION BY NON PATRIOTIC CONGRESSMEN  Vote Them Out.  Mark them for catapult by 2018 via EMP ISSUE
.@SenatorLankford How can we move forward when the nominees want to bring us back to the past by destroying edu, epa, constitution? #resist
.@SenatorLankford I'm proud of those standing up for the country and will remember those standing up for their party first as traitors.
Newsflash: the only ones putting party before country are the Democrats. #TheMoreYouKnow
How on Earth could you suggest that DeVos is even close to qualified for her position?
how on earth could you even say Obama was qualified for his.
Harvard Law School. Served in Illinois state Senate. U.S. Senator. #qualified
ah the infamous "you don't have experience as a president" unqualifier.
Just because it's "infamous" doesn't make it less accurate.
You right wingers obstructed Obama for EIGHT YEARS. You are in NO room to criticize anyone here.
@SenThomTillis welcome to the entire Obama presidency. Turnaround is a bitch.
Repubs obstructed for 8 years; 3 weeks and you're crying already! Stop whining
@SenThomTillis #MerrickGarland
@SenateGOP 
Teacher union run our kids education 
unqualified teacher at  the classroom 
DeVos is good to clean house
@RepTrentFranks Awww what's wrong, don't like to be treated how you guys treated Obama for eight years.
This hould speak VOLUMES as to how UNQUALIFIED the nominees are!
You should walk down to Library of Congress and check your facts before sending such smug inaccurate Tweets #LorettaLynch
@RepTrentFranks picking through the unqualified takes longer than the qualified.
Coming from a man who doesn't do his job.  Never votes with a conscience and is a complete YES man.
Maybe if 45 would stop appointing incompetents and traitors, it would speed things up a bit.
@SenateGOP I do believe it's YOU that needs to "MoveOn"!
@sendavidperdue Vote #noDevos and do the right thing for public education!!! Don't sell your vote!
It's because the majority of candidates are unqualified.  Did you notice?
They are terrified at the amount of work Trump will do. It will destroy their party.
@RepTrentFranks  After 8 years of obstruction you now want to talk about obstruction.  Sad!
The party of "NO" now wants Kumbaya? You reap what you sow! Where are Tump's taxes and who owns Trump debt?
@SenOrrinHatch pick better cabinet members. don't minimize questionings. vet them through ethics. and this wouldn't happen.
.rediculous. .this would happen no matter who is nominated. .democrats r against America. .fascists
Short sighted. Politics don't make people. And those who don't claim R or D gang? #gangster
@SenatorRisch #historicobstruction brought on by #historicunderqualifications.
#NoOnDeVos
@SenateMajLdr Try getting the paperwork to the Ethics Committee on time & providing qualified people for positions.
@SenateMajLdr it's called checks and balances
@SenThomTillis Obstruction? Some of us read "The New New Deal" gentlemen. Don't like your own game played against you, huh?
Shame on you @senJamesInhofe . You must thoroughly hate children! Betsy DeVos is wholly unqualified.    #resist #retweet
@RepTrentFranks good to know the cabinet must be promptly addressed but the Supreme Court can wait when it's not your guy
As one of your constituents, I am disappointed that you seem ready to rubber stamp these highly unqualified nominations.
@sendavidperdue No No No No, you have no cred on this issue. How does it feel when shoes on other foot? #notmysenator
Where do you get your facts? Fox News I suppose.?
@SenateMajLdr EXTREME VETTING is the phrase you're looking for. It can be used for more than just Islamaphobia.
@RepTrentFranks we don't like racists in the White House, try putting some good people in and I'm sure they will get approv
Sir, how much $ have you recieved from Ms. Devos?  Care to disclose?
@sendavidperdue is it that difficult to figure out?
Rev Lankford.More power them. U clowns aren't doing your home work your on this we gonna show them kick. Your bad 4 country
and it's a justified long walk. These people are not qualified
I'm guessing you mean the Democrats in the Senate...? Because it certainly isn't Trump's cabinet.
How is someone that has no experience in public education qualified?
Maybe public education is the problem. Therefore, experience in it makes one part of the problem.
Please have the courage to break with party lines when the issue is critical! This is that time. Please vote No on DeVos.
.@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Maybe if it wasn't a cabinet of woefully unqualified racists and misogynists???
@RepTrentFranks Maybe If they had been vetted properly and had all paperwork completed accurately before the hearings? Geez
With all due respect, it's because they are truly TERRIBLE options.
Over a year waiting for Merrick Garland to get a hearing, you talk about obstruction? Now you vote against rural OK schools
How dare you complain to Oklahomans about obstruction when state education is at the bottom of nation. #NotoDeVos
Right, complain about education quality, then bash the one person nominated in the last 40 years who can fix it.
The proof is in the pudding. U have the ability to forsee the future? Blind loyalty.
Nope. Do you? Yet somehow you know she'll be horrible. Blind loyalty.
#nonsensical Ur saying the same by alleging she can fix it. Like predicting an ass to win the derby.
Precedence is key. #DeVos has an atrocious record on #edu with no proven success.
http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/23/the-party-of-no-new-details-on-the-gop-plot-to-obstruct-obama/ â€¦. #hypocrisy #GOP
@SenThomTillis Pay To Play #CrookedMan
I guess they took a page from the GOP book. I seem to remember you guys doing this a lot the last 8 years
the fact that the nominees are inexperienced & unqualified may have something to do with it. 2018 can't come soon enough
@RepTrentFranks  INVESTIGATE RUSSIA TIES! DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR COUNTRY NOT PARTY! #TRUMPGATE #REMEMBERNIXON
@SenateGOP I'll just leave this here. Cronyism!
Recall Garland SCOTUS obstruction. This back and forth is why Congress approval rating is low. Both sides at fault.
Not in this case. Garland was obviously qualified.
Darling, what about @SenateMajLdr obstruction of Garland?  C'mon, nobody is buying this bs narrative. #hypocrite
Yes, it took longer than your party shoving your values down our throats. Then again, fascists move fast. ;)
@RepTrentFranks INVESTIGATE RUSSIA TIES! DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR COUNTRY NOT PARTY! #TRUMPGATE #REMEMBERNIXON
@SenateMajLdr Record obstruction for 8 years of the Obama administration.
because you have nominated a bunch of cronies and crooks who are not qualified, you imbeciles!
This is McConnell's doing. He needs to be primaried and tossed over the side.
Puzder had illegal immigrants. Devos has zero experience. Gorsuch is a radical!
Then vet ur choices better, then send them to congress. U didn't vet Trump well either. HISTAXESNOW.
Are you serious? The Rep. blocked everything Obama wanted to accomplish, including his SCOTUS nominee for an ENTIRE YEAR!!
@CongressmanHice that's because all of the picks are hideous.  Listen to your voters!!!  They are telling you this.
how is he a fascist?  Do you even know what that word is?
WHO IS YOUR CRACK DEALER?  They have some good stuff! #historicdelusion
@RepTrentFranks this may be the most hypocritical thing I've ever seen. You people have conveniently short memories.
I'll leave this here since no one would listen..
.@SenatorLankford I can't hear you over the sound of Merrick Garland not getting a hearing or a vote.
also didn't trump not even have a full list of nominees?
Yes, Senator, what about the hundreds of nominees not yet named, and the incomplete ethics forms? #sad
@SenateGOP it's sad that ANY of you have the balls to scream about corruption when every single 1 of you should be removed!
and wait here is another little piece of food for thought..
@SenThomTillis Perhaps it's because this is the least qualified, most backwards cabinet in history.
.@SenatorLankford .@RoyBlunt we are not done and you are not done hearing about it.
It's a historic obstruction because there's never been a more horrific list of nominees.  The voters are no longer asleep!
@SenateMajLdr crybaby snowflakes would rather take a long vacation paid for by Betsy DeVos.
@SenateMajLdr maybe @realDonaldTrump should've had his picks for vetting ready as soon as Obama did...
@SenateMajLdr I'll just leave this here..
I will NOT be silent.  I will NOT Move On.  I will continue protesting as is my right!
Republicans delayed Loretta Lynch's nomination for attorney general for more than 5 months.
DEAR @SenThomTillis & @SenatorLankford WATCH THIS VIDEO  http://tinyurl.com/homjxfm  & then tell us how you could appoint Sessions #AmeriKKKa?
Shame on you for voting for DeVos! Time to vote no on you in your next election.
@SenateMajLdr good
@SenateMajLdr uhhhhhh..... does Garland ring a bell?
@SenateGOP Well, let me say this-NO 2 HIS CABINET! WHAT HAPPEN 2 GARLAND? GET UR HEAD OUT UR ASS! DO WHAT'S RIGHT NOT EASY!
@SenThadCochran I'll just leave this right here
Yes, but perhaps this could have something to do with the quality of candidates being considered.
Possibly b/c almost every nominee is publicly opposed to the historical goal of the department theyâ€™re to lead?
it's time for you to #move on to a different job.. voting with your constituents is in your job description..you #failed
and we are proud it is taking this long.  Unqualified, without ethics you all just say yes. #RepublicanSheep
@SenThomTillis Hope you are enjoying your last term.

That's because Trump's SWAMP CABINET is a bunch of incompetent crooks!
.@SenatorLankford perhaps if they were not obviously being picked to help loot the country things might go faster. @SenTomCotton
You might see that if you could grow a backbone and listen 2 your constituents. You KNEW she was unqualified.
Interesting that the confirmation sessions are so short ...
@SenThomTillis Wow. Exactly how ignorant do you think the public is? You should be ashamed of yourselves for this bullshit.

@SenateMajLdr ummmmm did y'all forget how you refused to even meet with Garland? You haven't a leg to stand on
in your ear that if you don't do what we want we will pull our money from you.and for you not to be scared of that
Our goal is to make Trump a one term President! Obstruct at all costs! Unqualified, incompetent & cronyism!
Well if you'd listen to your constituents, it might go faster.
@SenThomTillis I'm sure that is what Goebbels said to those that opposed Hitler's policies.
And I hope they can keep it for four years!!!
more than 500 of the positions to be confirmed are still without nominees. #HisFault #HisBad #YouLIE
@SenThomTillis We have an historically disastrous administration. I personally can't wait to see you both voted out.
@SenatorRisch The people nominated are racist, not qualified, etc. Respect the system!
does the name MERRICK GARLAND ring a bell, sir? MM and co SAT on his nomination for over 300 days. Short memory u have.
At least they are standing up for something they believe in and not taking bribes. They are LISTENING to their constituents
He hasn't even vetted his applicants properly. How can you say it is taking historic lengths of time?
@SenThomTillis Republicans did nothing but obstruct for the last 8 years. Not so fun when it's happening to you, huh?
You want to talk about obstruction.  Merrick Garland!!!!!
Wow. You'll just "leave this here". cool, cool. I'll just leave a little reminder about Merrick Garland here. Oh and this
@sendavidperdue You sold out the children of Georgia. Gird your loins. Winter is coming.
The hypocrisy after the last 8yrs of total obstruction where McConnell stated you'd all oppose Obama? Shame on you all.
Remember Eric Cantor... enjoy your last term in office.
@SenThomTillis you're kidding right? You've all done a bang up job of obstructing for the past 8 years.
#45's nominees are the worst of the worst, a kakistocracy. @GOP owns this monster. You align yourselves with #45
maybe because it's the worst selection of cabinet members in the history of our country?
Please justify how a debate about a senator becoming AG can silence any negative or bad remarks? How is that a debate?
Great job Sen Lankford.
not moving on--his cabinet is unqualified.  I'm coming for you at the next election cycle.
.@SenatorLankford #historicobstruction is ridiculously misleading, but from a politician who shills alternative facts, what can I expect.

I'll leave this right here....Merrick Garland.
The stench of your hypocrisy is unbearable. Remember Merrick Garland? Do you believe your own BS? Please lead.
- yes leave it here. Please. They're slow BECAUSE THE NOMINEES SUCK #getagrip already. I'm #ashamed you are our rep.
@SenateGOP 
@SpeakerRyan 
We need to stop the Democrats games 
No more delays
We're still waiting for Republicans to confirm Garland. And to investigate Russian treason. #Traitor
@SenThomTillis maybe because they didn't do their paperwork and this admin is historically disorganized and unqualified?
@SenOrrinHatch Because they are all unqualified losers!  Get a clue!
@SenatorRisch this is completely false.
Refusal to vote on Garland also historic obstruction; Irony-klahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plains!
that's because of his picks, #NoonDeVos ,#NoonSession, #NoonBannon,
There were only 4 cabinet members under George Washington TWIT
Have you considered how many nominees are unqualified and ill-equipped to serve? It should take longer than usual.
So lets talk about Garland then?
all I see is a bunch of rich folks fighting to get richer. I don't see you fighting for us the people. We needed better
@RoyBlunt Oh please. Quit your whining. Do we need to quote McConnell circa 2008-2016 back to you? Get used to it.
It's time for the GOP to listen to the Majority, Dem. obstuck because they are listening!  #resist
Instead of voting the party line, vote qualifications and moving the country forward and not backward. = less obstruction.
@RoyBlunt because they're the least qualified. Where are your principles?
@SenThomTillis MERRICK GARLAND
Even a Republican Senate has trouble gagging down the sort of nominees Donald Trump drags before them.
Sen. Inhofe, you let $ and partisanship obstruct today. DeVos is not qualified you know that. Listen to Oklahoma teachers
@SenateMajLdr Poor GOP babies. Your King Sociopath nominated idiots.
@SenThomTillis This is an absurd argument. If the nominations were better, confirmations would be faster...
@SenateMajLdr It's funny how Trump supporters claim Politico isn't a source. Then Trump's people post this lol
That's because the cabinet is unqualified and hasn't filed ethics papers. Mnuchin profited from Madoff scam.
@RoyBlunt  you've seen nothing yet.  Historic Hypocrisy and fleecing of America by the GOP.
@SenOrrinHatch please don't throw rocks. #glasshouses
@SenMikeLee #alternativefacts
The American Progressive have stolen the Dem party. They are out of control. GET LOUD Repubs no more PC
@sendavidperdue if Trump didn't pick such incompetent people then there wouldn't be such a problem
@SenMikeLee and I'll leave this here.
@SenThomTillis Merrick Garland
Good show, thanks for proof of your own hypocrisy. Keep it coming please.
Excuse me but what about 6 years of the repubs obstruction of President Obama @BarackObama
Look up the word "hypocrite" in the dictionary.
@SenatorRisch I know some people hate details, but your job is to read past the headlines: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/how-long-confirmations-will-take/ â€¦
@SenateGOP do you have no decency? Do you not realize the world sees your hypocrisy through your white hoods?
It's because we are not fooled, like you, by @POTUS and his lack of transparency with his ties to Russia. #MICHAELFLYNN
Are you kidding me?
we've also never had picks so unqualified. Stop the #tyranny of the majority. Might does not equal right
.@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr just leave this one there too #MoveOut
@SenThomTillis Just ask them to confirm decent people instead of facists! The people don't want them to be confirmed!
could be poor vetting #lack of documents.
@SenateMajLdr I'll just leave this here. Merrick Garland #GOPobstruction
Republicans have NO leg to stand on with regards to obstruction.
@SenTomCotton Dteven Mnuchin owner of one West Bank guilty of falsifying mortgage documents so he could foreclose on people
@SenThomTillis It's not a party line issue. It's a ridiculously poor choices issue.
changes comes from within...youre going the wrong way ....Search your heart and you will change your mind
