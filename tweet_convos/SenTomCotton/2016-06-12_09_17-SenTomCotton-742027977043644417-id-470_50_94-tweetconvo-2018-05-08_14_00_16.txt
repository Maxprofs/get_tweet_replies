stop praying and start taking action to make our state/country safe for the LGBTQ+ community. Until then, none of us are safe.
didn't you vote to allow terror suspects to buy guns?
you offered prayers on Sunday. It's time to act today.  Ask a question, walk down, join the #filibuster
seriously?  how do you spell hypocrite?  t o m  c o t t o n
#47traitors Trumprepublican, GUN RIGHTS FOR ALL Muslim ban,kill ISIS&Family members,BUILD the Dang Wall,Jail abortion Drs&pts
seriously dude, how do you sleep at night. #hypocrite
how can Hillary Clinton sleep at night?
Please support majority of Americans (and me as a gun owner) by voting FOR Feinstein and Murphy amendments!
You hope and prayers are worthless vote against terrorists buying assault rifles and then I might take you seriously
keep ur prayers unless u donate $1.9M #NRABloodMoney to victims & reform gun laws. #SandyHook #Aurora #Orlando #Enough
The GOP is the party of domestic terrorism against women, immigrants, LGBT people, and people of color. #shameonyou
You are responsible of their deaths and should be ashamed.
Sir you are 1 of many to be blamed for the mass shootings in our country! @SenTomCotton #guncontrolplease
Your vote allowed this guy to buy guns. Don’t pray, act. Be a better human. Be a better Senator. #Orlando
you have a voice, you can make a difference to prevent more things like this so why aren't you doing so?
Stop abetting the slaughter of Americans Tom: "An evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek."
You continue to take money from @NRA and you have yet to do anything to stop this from happening. How many children have to die? Shame.
Don't just "pray." ACT. Do something that would prevent more massacres from happening. Maybe some common sense gun laws???
why have u accepted thousands of $ in donations from the NRA? Why did you reject the 2013 background checks bill?#Orlando
Mary Lou Nye, 62 years old. Shot 2/20/2016, Kalamazoo County, Mich. #MakeItStop
support  @ChrisMurphyCT and his #NoFlyNoBuy & #BGChecks you talks of "prayers" but I remind you James 2:14-26. Do Your Part!
stop taking NRA money and do something about assault weapons
kinda looks like you.
Please support the background checks on the Senate Floor. @SenTomCotton These are supported by a majority of Americans and gun owners. #arpx
Over $2M - is it worth US citizen's lives and safety?  GIVE BACK NRA MONEY.  Vote for gun protections.
Save your words, they are empty without action. And get the NRA's hand out of your pocket and pass sensible legislation
instead of praying for the victims that are already dead why not pray to your creator to stop creating terrorists n homophobes
Enough of your hypocritical "prayers."  You have blood on your hands.
maybe you could actually do something about this by restricting access to assault weapons.
@vickscan @SenTomCotton Background checks would be great  I agree
Hypocrite. @SenTomCotton
My prayers, and the prayers of all Arkansans, are with the victims of last night's attack in Orlando and their families.
@vickscan @SenTomCotton I can understand why you would say that but wish not to condemn words of comfort
That’s all he is willing to provide. Words. Meaningless words. @vickscan @SenTomCotton
Well I hope that he can realize that we are all human and can make mistakes but we can also change
your prayers are worthless without action. DO something
then do something about it!!!!! Quit letting the @NRA buy your votes and the souls of Americans
your prayers mean nothing without action and conviction behind them. You have power and platform to end this violence. Use it.
What god would listen to you? You're a shill and a lapdog for the NRA. Only actions count.
@SenTomCotton
@SenTomCotton
Why would you send prayers to the LGBT community? You can't even say LGBT.
bullshit.
Could you provide evidence that your prayers do any good? These prayers seem to be correlating to more deaths. #GOPFAIL
Don't you dare speak for me. You make it harder to be proud as an Arkansan every day.
Your prayers but not your vote for gun safety over terrorism. You and your ilk are an embarrassment and a menace.
did you ask your Iranian pen pals for permission before sending out this stupid tweet?Do something for once like banning AR-15
take action NOW on high-powered weapons designed to kill hundreds in a matter of minutes. #DontWait #Bloodonyourhands #Action
But you still push for laws that limit gays' freedoms? Your prayers are empty if your actions seek to harm.
screw your prayers!  You are against lgbt rights and for gun rights. As an Arkansan you shame me.
Keep your prayers. Do your job and vote to ban assault rifles!
But you helped enable the killing

The victims' families know this

Why would you pray for them?
Are you in the clergy or the legislature? You didn't get elected to pray. Do your job and pass legislation.
You craven tool,you took $2million from the NRA and killed a bill that will keep guns from terrorists. The blood is on you.
No they are not. God hates fags, right? They are an "abomination". Don't deserve civil rights including right to marry.liar
received $2.6M from the NRA to allow terrorists to buy military grade weaponry
Justify that rights to Life Liberty Pursuit of happiness of103 get obliterated by the second amendment rights of 1?
not only a traitor, but a well bribed stooge of the NRA. Stop praying and do something to protect Americans from this.
Save your prayers, @SenTomCotton. You voted numerous times against those 49 victims because of their sexual orientation. Shame on you.
u directly killed those people by voting against a Bill that would've prevented Omar Mateen from buying guns  #NRAbloodmoney
Your prayers are worthless. You voted to help make this happen and have blood on your hands.
.@SenTomCotton Stop insulting #Orlando victims, survivors & families when you openly hate LGBT AND won't entertain common sense gun control.
thoughts and prayers are for us people outside of the gov, not you people who can do something about it. Shameless NRA Lapdog.
you've had your time praying. Now get back to work & act, on behalf of Americans NOT the NRA.
But your vote is firmly with the @NRA and your pile of blood money #lawsnotprayers #DoYourJob
you belong in jail. Your prayers can't help them but your vote would have saved their lives.
Just shut up with your phony prayers. You love NRA money & hate LGBTs. You've taken so much $$ fr NRA that you do anything 4em
another ass clown who needs to be voted out. All of them, all hypocrites who serve the almighty dollar
Your thoughts and prayers will never protect a single American life. If you can't be moved to action, you're a coward.
You took $51,635.88 from the NRA for every person murdered in #Orlando. Was it worth it? #Coward #HowDoYouLiveWithYourself?
your thoughts and prayers for Orlando are meaningless. You have received more than $1,900,000 from the NRA.
what are you going to do to reduce the killing ability of homophobes
$2,581,794 worth of #Bloodonyourhands
bullshit. You vote against everything that helps LGBT community. My guess is you're thong dancing on tables for a buck
Tom, this got 94 likes, place your fear aside and take a stand.
You are SO Fake !
.@SenTomCotton #NRABloodMoney means more to you than the lives of the people slaughtered. Stop lying.
The time for prayers are over. The time to ban these military grade weapons is NOW.
Since the NRA bought and own you, what soap will you be using to wash the soap off your hands?
get your hands out of the pockets of the NRA senator and protect Americans. Shame on u.
And my hard work and keenest efforts are with the folks working to get these weapons in as many hands as possible.
Don't include me in your BS tweet. Your anti-LGBT voting record and hate filled statements are the real you. #fakechristian
Prayers are nice but when you vote to loosen gun laws and take $2.5 million from @NRA, undrstnd your wrds are an insult.
#47traitors &NOW Hypocrite 4 letting people on terror watch list buy guns/assault rifle
.@SenTomCotton Your prayers should be that Congress enacts sensible gun control & bans assault weapons #GunSense #VoteCongressBlue
URcomplicit in this crime accepting$2.5mIl from NRA&U voted AGAINSTclosing gap against those on terror watchlist from get guns
this is an empty cliche that means nothing when you are a gun lobby lapdog.
You took almost $2m from the NRA, thoughts are the last thing needed, we've already seen you actions. #deleteYourAccount
@SenTomCotton
Hypocrisy is breathtaking. Yr party is at war with LGBTQ rights & you want us to believe you're PRAYING? #FaithWithoutWorks
Take your prayers & put them in your NRA  #yourWordsMeanNothing
May God have mercy on your sorry soul while you promote hatred and fear with religion.  #OrlandoNightclubShooting
Denounce homophobia @SenTomCotton
sir please remember don't allow this to cause more laws to,get pushed through.
If @SenTomCotton had any human decency, he'd keep his hypocritical thoughts and prayers to himself.But then we know he doesn't. #gunsense
Yes. @SenTomCotton lacks human decency.
since I guess you get well paid by the NRA not to do more, I'm sure prayers are the best you can do.
My prayers are that you'll grow a damned conscience and realize that YOU are part of the damned problem.
There is blood on your hands, sir.
sterilizing yourself would be more beneficial than sending your thoughts and prayers
fraud
Blood on your hands.  Took NRA money and voted to give guns to terrorists. Your prayers are worthless.
hahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha what
Worthless words. You are against LGBT rights and are so pro-gun, you take $2 million from the NRA.
You sir, are responsible for these deaths. You and your anti #LGBTQ community hate mongers. This shooter is one of yours.
Fuck you treasonous shitbird with your $2million from @NRA in expenditures and voting against my Country's interests #traitor
U received 2.5M in expenditures from NRA & voted against closing terror gap. What do your prayers matter? #bloodonyourhands
Shame #ThoughtsAndPrayers  How's that $2,581,794 in expenditures from the @NRA holding up 4 U while u hold up #SCOTUSnominee ?
I'm sure that makes them feel much better.
It's too bad no Republicans think about this when it comes time to vote abt gun regulations.
really Tom?  You are brought and paid for by the #nra. If God said vote for background checks u would decline.  #gunskill
Thank you Pastor Cotton for your thoughts & prayers. Now go be a Senator and do your fucking job for the people, not the @NRA @SenTomCotton
Your prayers are as empty as a legislator's  conscience as he cashes @NRA checks. @SenTomCotton #DefeatGOP
#DennisHastert #KenStarr #TomCotton ... get the picture? God cares not for the prayers of an unrepentant hypocrite.

Sen @TomCottonAR received $2,581,794 in expenditures from NRA, so he voted against closing terror gap back in Dec https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/742027977043644417 …
WOW! At least you don't come cheap. More than 2M from the most violent terrorist group in the country, the NRA. Hypocrite.
in fact,by taking NO action, you've done the exact opposite of what you claim by saying prayers.
Jesus would be ashamed of you.what a cop out.."praying" but taking NO action..
Your prayers are worthless now. You have contributed to this kind of hate and have supported unconscionable NRA laws.
oh really? You give a crap about these 50 ppl eh? Then maybe you should TAKE ACTION instead of simply praying.
What is this bullshit that repugs spew to make people think they care? You're part of the problem. You helped pull the trigger
YOU voted against LBGT Community for years and against banning assault rifles. This is on YOU. Pray for YOURSELF.
Seriously Tom? That's it? Why not use your power for good?
If you aren't part of the solution then you are part of the problem
dude, keep your empty prayers. You don't care and it's obviously sad.
They don't need your prayers.
They need you to stand up for gun laws.
Your prayers aren't preventing mass killings. What action will you take to #EndGunViolence?  #DoYourJob
Instead of #prayer, how about donating the $3Million in donations you've received from @NRA to help fight domestic #terrorism?
give us policy and laws, not prayers. We sent you to Washington to govern, not pray. #emptywords
Prayers don't keep assault riffles out of the hands of killers.  DO something other than try to obstruct change.
Prayers are meaningless just your way of pretending to be Christian, you need to ban assault weapons
.@SenTomCotton Quit praying and do something!!! Like your job!!... Oh wait you took money from the gun lobby so you'll just do nothing. .. 
you actually pray?
- give the NRA back their $ and wipe the blood off YOUR hands.
You allowed ppl on "no fly list" to buy guns like AR-15
.@SenTomCotton We need more than just prayers.We need action to stop people on terror list fr buying guns,ban assault weapons,high cap clips
Thoughts and prayers are easy. When will you do what is hard and actually stand up for Americans and say #NotOneMore? #Enough?
Prayers are all you do!! We need action numb Nutz!
Try coming out the closet & standing in solidarity with your people rather than playing handpuppet to the @FocusOnTheFamiy
Neither gun control, nor climate change, will stop or affect terrorism, not one iota, not one single life...
Please keep tour self serving prayers, the NRA owns you!!!!
Hope one of his staffers shows him these responses.  Complicit. Corrupt. Hypocritical.
Sen @TomCottonAR $2,581,794 from the NRA? Then you voted against closing terror gap back in Dec. $$$$$
My prayers, and the prayers of all Arkansans, are with the victims of last night's attack in Orlando and their families.
How about some laws that guarantee public safety instead of a profit for gun manufacturers?
#bloodonyourhands
you're a hypocrite !
To quote one of your own: YOU LIE!  Your words are empty & meaningless coming from the likes of you.  Treasonous #traitor.
Forget the frickin prayers & DO something to prevent mass murders like this! People w guns kill people way too often! @SenTomCotton
Jesus hates a liar, Thomas.
we, the villagers of Orlando, offer you pitchforks, torches, and a rail you can ride out on. #NRABLOODONYOURHANDS
DO SOMETHING BESIDES PRAY
You took $2.58 MILLION (had to read it 2X) from the NRA. How fucking dare you pretend to care. Your false prayers do nothing.
your prayers do nothing, kinda like you
Stay Strong Tom!  Liberals r gonna blame this on guns bc admitting it was a radical Islamic goes against their beliefs.
You do know those victims were likely gay, right? Didn't you call being gay a crime?
Tom you are only doing what the NRA is paying you to do, wise up.
then do something besides offer empty platitudes
