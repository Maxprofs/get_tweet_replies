Finally found 1 Republican who found his conscience! Now find your integrity & Stop the Madness! Fix Obamacare, Then move on!
ACA is not affordable
Trump has spent a total of 50 million in Security in 6 months. That would pay for Voters in 5 states for 3 years.
Nothing is free. Healthy able body people need to work and pay for their own healthcare. We need to take care of old and sick.
It is Wicked, Evil & Morally wrong when you have the means or been elected to help others but You help yourself first! Find A Way!
can you go to any other country and make yourself at home and milk their social programs? We're a land of laws.
I hope you will vote YES on Health Care Reform.  I am counting on YOU to reconsider.
So what's your issue with it? And you realize we can't move on till this is worked out. So work with them , fix it
Even a stopped clock is right two times a day. On bright side, maybe u can screw people even worse on next try. #fixdontrepeal
now ur talking
Don't just vote no - please make sure enough GOP vote no so this disaster of a plan does NOT pass.
Support it now, amend and fix later!!!!
Do you not support it because it would hurt too many of your constituents, or not enough?
Good for you.  #killthebill
thx cuz some of us struggle with high premiums
so you saying screw us, the prez, the tax reform and infrastructure... that's cool... we will remember 2018
I think people will remember when the senator finally stood up for what's right for the American people.
He's from Arkansas. Let's see what they think at election time. Maybe Tom will retire early.
That's okay. He's plenty dirty dealing to keep his constituents happy.
are you against because it's wrong or because it doesn't completely destroy care for every one in America?
the second one
Thank you for voting no. Obamacare needs to be replaced but not at cost of screwing over poor people on medicaid.
I hope that you will stand by your commitment to Arkansans and help provide affordable healthcare to them.
Did you ever think you would be retweeting Sen Cotton??
He needs to get in there and help fix it, but he is not doing anything. The president will let us know what you did #Nothing
Thank you! This bill need to be thrown out and start over with a full repeal!
Please oppose the #Trumpcare on behalf of your district in NWA. Thank you.
Thank YOU for putting people before Party! #PeopleBeforeProfits
c'mon Tom!
thank you!
Why not just fix Obamacare? Country over party. Keep your seat. Then #ImpeachTrump
I love that Ryan/Trump are using the line "our long national nightmare is over". Same thing Ford said after Nixon impeached.
@AmerMedicalAssn @ahahospitals @American_Heart @LungAssociation  @AARP @AmerAcadPeds @AmDiabetesAssn
NEW: AMA declares opposition to Senate GOP health care bill, saying it violates "first, do no harm" principle "on many levels.” 
what is Paul Ryan thinking! Making this way harder than should be ! Repeal!! Like Repubs been promising 7 yrs
Thank you!
@Lynn_Rose1 guess you will have t make some changes, I believe that’s the process, unless the Senate is afraid of this issue
http://www.texaspolicy.com/library/doclib/Top-Ten-Conservative-Concerns.pdf …
And we cannot support you backstabbing the President. You have lost our votes next time unless we see you turn around.
please do not give in! This bill sucks! Glorified Obamacare! We don't won't our name on it!
I take back my earlier statement about you being a republican drone. Thanks for listening to Arkansans Come to central AR 4 TH
@billpostmus Well get you butt in gear and work on it til you like it Tom!  It has to be done.
@NormEisen Wish @SenCoryGardner would do the same... but he's trump all day long SAD!
Hitched his sad wagon to the wrong "bad hombre"
Kill obamacare dead then Wal-Mart & Walgreens will sell us medicine. Our govt has no business at all regulating health. @SenTomCotton
yeah screw regulations that make drugs safe!!!!!!!!
#FullRepeal only, plz
We dont need govt healthcare just cause others have it. We are better than other nations. Be different!
Wow Tom, I didn't think I could lose anymore respect for Congress than I had, but yeah you guys drug me there. Crash & burn!
Tom What happens if you don't get your job done.Have to get deductables down. Killing us!
Thank you, Senator.
I understand, the subsidies are horrible and the elderly have to pay WAY to much.
Americans Won't forget this if you guys allow Obamacare to stand! Keep your promise!
Don't let him blackmail you. BLOCK THE HEALTHCARE BILL.
Thank you. Keep fighting for what is right.
Thank you, sir, for listening to the people. Too bad not enough others in your party have that courage.
if you want to do Healthcare right then push for universal healthcare
So help Fix the Damn thing Senator!
Thank you. I am STILL waiting on disability hearing and Medicaid is a life-saver. Without it: Dead.
Agree.  Repeal. New plan.  Only solution.
Thank you  Hold the line
thank you, Tom, for protecting and caring about our health. As a small business owner, the ACA has been a lifesaver.
Good!
Thank you, sir, for standing against this.  Stay the course!
please help to make it right. #healthcare
good vote against it
Glad to see you unwaveringly standing up for what's right. Pls carry that ideal into all the issues. People over politics.
Watch "Tactical Tom" closely. Talk is cheap; tweeting is easy.  Beware the poseur.
Thank you very much!
why not polliticol or money
Thank you!
Amen
Thank You!  Not in your district but thank you for standing up for what's good for America!
@NormEisen $10 he votes yes anyway...
@DeeTx1953 Thank you
@ASlavitt Everyone needs to relax because you're fine, just don't get sick. But, if you have to do it in a European country.
@ASlavitt "To many poor folks still getting coverage and the tax brakes aren't big enough for my donors", Tommy continued.
@DeepSouthProud Thanks you for standing with conservatives!!!
@AmericanBrawn1 they need to just repeal Obamacare, worry about Replacement later. Focus on jobs and Deportations
@AmericanBrawn1 it's not going to Pass, not enough support from Congress
Thank you, Senator @SenTomCotton !!
Better to wait and get it right than to accept a bastardized version of Obamacare.  Ryan is disgraceful and apparently deaf!
Good for you!!!
@LeftsideAnnie The Tea Party's Poster Child hath spoken!
Thanks rich dude, I'll send you the bill for my wife's surgery. I owe a $14500 deductable on it. I'll look you up next ballot
Thank you!
Not mean-spirited or extreme enough for Cotton. The unbearable whiteness of Cotton.
Thank you!
Thank you for taking a strong stance against the AHCA!  It is by far a worse choice than Obamacare.
Don't get cold feet now.
I think you ought to support. I'm sure you can alter the bill in the senate, but we need to start the dismantled by phases.
@ASlavitt Congratulations Tom.Let's get a plan that provides health care for all Americans & NO tax cuts for rich guys like me
Not heartless enough, eh?  #FutureDemagoguesOfAmerica
@ASlavitt yay
A big thank you to the democrat senator from Arkansas. Obamacare forever! Fuck Trump and his wanting to make things better
@thepoliticalcat Thank you. Obviously your constituents at your town hall asking you to look after them had an effect.
@ASlavitt Thanks. You're still a traitor to the US, Tom.
THANK YOU!!! Current polling average of public support for TrumpCare/RyanCare: 30% approve, 47% disapprove.
Good!  Hope you're thinking of the many veterans who depend on the ACA
.@SenTomCotton @ASlavitt Walk that plank! Walk that plank! Walk that plank! #TrumpCare #PaulRyanKegger
Come on...if you can't support this bill then come up with something better. We need a win here Senator!
@Courage1791 THANK YOU, Senator Cotton! You are watching out for us! 
@NormEisen Thank you for listening to your constituents, unlike @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander
I trust your judgement. You are right about getting it right the first time. Stand your ground!
If Congress can't pass a bill I will make sure I vote against everyone who is currently in office.
Thank you!!!
@ASlavitt Respect.
thank you sir it is Obama care in descuise
thank you! It is wonderful to hear from level headed legislators from both sides of the aisle!
I will not support you nor vote for anyone next election  who deserts the President when he needs you most. IMAGA! Pass it!
R's killing R's... Thats how Obama was elected. Sweet
And the damnations shall follow the damned
Impressed, at least at this point.   I'm an Independent voter in PA, & haven't honestly agreed with you all that often, but this is a start.
As a constituent, I thank you for your position on the untenable health care bill.
Right!
What bothers me is I still can't understand it...but, I thnk there is still too much gov't interference.? A little more tweek?
thank you for standing against the new bill repeal Obamacare!!!
Thank you for caring for your constituents who need healthcare affordable. Integrity over politics. #TrumpCare
stay the course Tom!
Thank you. You've just increased your chances of reelection.
Thank you for looking out for the American people.
@KattyKayBBC Stand tough, Senator.
@KattyKayBBC I believe and hope that sen cotton is correct
@KattyKayBBC That lady with the dying husband made you feel human emotions, eh? Or is it not cutting enough, like Lee?
You MUST support the Republican ACA bill!NO obstructionists allowed-MAGA
.@SenTomCotton thank you for saying no to the #AHCA / #Trumpcare. Having 24M people lose coverage is a nightmare I don't want to see.
then fox it
Why? Because of some purity test that sacrifices the good for the sake of the perfect? Okay then, we'll remember.
Keep fight for us. @billpostmus
@dougstafford  #FullRepeal #StandWithRand
could you stand against more of the garbage? This is the only thing you haven't blindly followed.#resist
If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem!
sit down with @SpeakerRyan and fix it- stop this public bashing
@jjmplsmn Thank you on behalf of your constituents
glad to hear you are looking out for us and not just following party lines
Thank you Sen Cotton!!
Senator Cotton I am extremely disappointed I your decision on the American Health Bill. I have been watching and reconsider.
@akmk you know, Tom, you were just a youngin, but Hillary proposed a BETTER solution back in the 90's.
Thank you.
Better than OBamacare.  Need to support our @POTUS and his judgment.
I thought Tom Price has alot of control over reducing regulations and would be addressing that in round two.Dems 1 Repubs 0
@SpeakerRyan hey Speaker are you Listening?  Once again it's not what Americans want. Start over. Why want Republucans listen?
Thank you!
@7im Good.
@ThePlumLineGS my disabled kids on Medicaid thank you
@ThePlumLineGS thank you
@billpostmus just redo the bill when it gets to Senate and atom whining
Good on ya, stay strong! 
There's gotta be a way to kill more people faster. I trust you'll figure it out!
thank you!
@ThePlumLineGS thank you
@POTUS @VP Ok Tom, then let's get to negotiation and work it out!!  You know all the players! Work it out!
I agree it's not perfect.  But I think it's an important first step.  Make critical changes ASAP and pass it Thursday.
you'd be a hero if you'd make private insurance compete. Add the #PublicOption to the ACA. Repair instead of replace.
@biannagolodryga You mean to tell me you have a soul? Not buying it! You so want to repeal it and it will be repealed
you don't have a soul nor conscience so we know you'll sleep just fine at night 
@WinnieWrightTV We want the ACA made better, for all Americans
@ThePlumLineGS Thank you for keeping your constituents first in mind rather than partisan efforts
Thank you. People are more important than parties. Certainly more than tax breaks for the wealthy.
That's not his angle.
Oh, I know. Just slipping a needle into the compliment.
Stay strong, Sen.Cotton. This bill harms lower income & older Americans (like me!). Thanks for your opposition.
@ThePlumLineGS Yeah, cutting 24 million people off health insurance is a tough sell.
I thought idea is to get 1st step bill thru reconciliation out of Congress to be amended by Senate on way to WH -- R U foregone concluding?
@ThePlumLineGS gotta stick to your ideals no problem
are you kidding? You are going to be responsible for keeping Obamacare? Give us a break.
@billpostmus Why Republicans lose.  Only Trump can win.
.@SenTomCotton thank you! Please keep speaking out against this awful, cruel AHCA bill.
@TattooQ Work with the House & President-compromise. Don't be the reason we're stuck with Obamacare. It's a career ender.
Thank you, Senator, for putting country before party on this bill.
@ThePlumLineGS you might say it would cause personal pain
@ThePlumLineGS thank you.
We know Tom, they don't need your vote to get it passed. It a political game.
You don't want the people to get tax reform then, get to work
Thank you. This bill would be devastating to children in Arkansas.
The new unaffordable obamacare or Ryancare is more federal mandates on medical care. Get OUR govt OUT of our lives !!! @SenTomCotton
cmon, the government saves us from the corporate wolves, or they did before this administration.....
I just want to see you clowns go on record now that you CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 40+ "Repeal" votes when Dem was Prez. #fakes
I'll give you credit for this. the bill is a disaster! ~200,000 in AR stand to lose insurance if passed! #Trumpcare
Thank you This plan is nothing but a tax cut for the rich & a death sentences for the poor & elderly Americans most vulnerable
Good. Repeal only do not replace.  Gov has no place in health insurance
Please convince French Hill and Boozman of same. From Searcy. @RepFrenchHill @JohnBoozman
Thank you sir for being sane minded ! Someone in that town has to !!
I've never said these words before but, thank you Tom Cotton.
.@SenTomCotton Repeal ACA, allow across state lines, increase HSAs, incentivize charities. Free market solution.
HSAs are shit. If not universal or single payer (what tom cotton has) I'll keep my HRA thank you.
You'd better start compromising. If you block the HC Bill and it goes down in defeat, We, Repubs, will throw you out next time
we've got your back. This bill is a disaster.
I am a Dem. I have followed your tweets lately and although I may not agree w/ U politically, I appreciate a principled person
in our Congress. It seems there are too few, on both sides kid the aisle, these days. Thank you
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz Do NOT allow #RyanCare #TrumpCare to pass, Americans support you, No different than ObamaCare! @POTUS
You NEED to support the healthcare plan. If not, you'll have screwed your voters and your future votes
I'm not clear on what you want
if you don't support it, we will be stuck with obama care! You need to stand behind our president now!
Then please put something together that can pass. Thanks
Thank you for showing some backbone and thinking of Arkansas.
Just fix the ACA! That's what people want!
Why were you in Israel instead of helping to make this bill more palatable?
It's called the internet. You are using it now.
I'm guessing you'll eventually get around to a yes vote no matter how much posturing you do between now & then. #GOPComplicit
I actually agree with you on something!
Thank you  Senator for standing for what is best rather than what is fast.
I'm disappointed in you and will not vote for you the next time
You were the only one to Stand against Corker Bill giving Iran Nukes; Keep your Conservatism, stand on principle! Go Tom!
You're a good man, @SenTomCotton. Thank you for your service. @SpeakerRyan, make the ACA bill better.
I am a former Arkansas resident and my family and friends DO vote in your district! Please be more open! Balancing the Budget is URGENT
The House Republicans are trying to unite with the @freedomcaucus fix this bill!I am on ACA 63 yrs might not have ins but I want this passed
Thank you Sir!
Is it because you didn't write it. We all know u don't like anything that's not ur idea.
Bless you. Not many like you doing the right thing for the people you represent. #courage
it'll pass the house and fail the senate. Probably designed to do that, than ACA blows up,
Senator you will have your chance to put your own amendment in this bill! Please DO NOT say that your vote is cast in stone!
Congress had 7 years to do their jobs. Looks like it's time for new people. To bad Senator, I actually supported you.
Hold fast, Sir.  Do not pass this nightmare.  Stand firm please!
military world; everyone gets health care as part of push for max participation/mission accomplishment. GDP similar concept?
Then go back to the table and fix it - it is YOUR JOB to do so! Work it out!
Thank you.
