you call yourself a leader. HAHAHAHAHA! #DOYOURJOB call for hearings on the Supreme Court nominee per Constitution
It's ironic that you're using #DoYourJob when you aren't doing yours. #ConfirmGarland
Well, this is awkward! Do u even know what it means to #DoYourJob? When R u mtg w/the SCOTUS nominee?
Also, remember the #ZadrogaAct - and how long you left those brave 1st responders hanging?
amusing that you tell others to do their jobs when you refuse to do yours...THIEF!
HOW CAN YOU USE #DOYOURJOB???????
no politician should be taking any $$ away from the military - they protect all you cowards
No you fools need to vote Garland and accomplish your Constitutional goal so do it, do it, do it! #DoYourJob
you mean like what you do with jobs and the economy?
I think we should rule out a neurological event here.  You are so divorced from reality, its disconcerting.
Have you had a cat scan?  MRI?  I think you should set one up.  There is clearly something bad happening in your attic, Mitch.
No more war. No more funding for warmongering.
That was such a helpful comment for the country; thanks! Will grant u this: You r working hard for the money, sir. #DoYourJob
GOP (and that's a joke) lies as usual. You deserve Trump.
instead of trying to get rid of peoples healthcare, #doyourjob and confirm the SCOTUS nominee
And of course you know the reason it's "bogged down" obstructionist. DO YOUR JOB divider.
Nice to see you giving it back to the left. Keep up the good work!
oh bite me, I've been watching 30 years of cuts to veterans in bipartisan fashion #bothpartieshateus
I'm late but hopefully we are on the same topic of #DoYourJob , think we can get a Supreme Court Justice?
put it up for vote or shut up
McConnell needs 2 look himself in the mirror when he says "do your job"
McConnell says " I SUPPORT Clown Trump 2 declare war. After all, Trump reads the National Enquirer, Trump is Prepared"
How can you even keep a straight face and tell someone to communicate such bullshit?
@SenTomCotton not supporting Senators Cruz Lee Cotton futhers proves you are a Lair
@SenTomCotton in your $174,000 plus owe us the apology HOW DARE YOU TABLE S AMDT 3897
@SenTomCotton Mr McConnell Sen Cruz owed none of you in the senate an apology it is those of you who lied to those who put
....and this comes from the very definition of Hypocracy.
I believe I got your attn Sir, SCOUS Nominee, awaits your hearings and up down vote #Do Your Job
What a tool you are!!!  They're just following your playbook.
@SenateMajLdr
Mitch is running scared. All over Twitter making it seem like he's doing something. We know it's all political horse crap.
#HYPOCRITE #GopHatesVeterans

Hey You Jerk #DoYourJob
Hey #DoYourJob
#DoYourJob
are you even a real person? No real person can be as bad as you are. I mean that would be embarrassing #VoteThemOut #DoYourJob
senior cheif johnson: perception is a bitch
bullshit. #DoYourJob
Speaking of #DoYourJob, you'll have hearings for #SCOTUSnom Garland when you get back, right?
How do you sleep at night?  #GOPhypocrite. #delusional  I was R for 25 yr until y'all made it embarrassing.
8 years ago you kicked America's People under the bus for the sake of @GOP obstructionism. Any bill you support needs a look.
Who voted to cut Veteren's benefits? Who loves war but not the warrior?
Dems?! What about the Repubs?! They vote down every bill to help veterans! If Dems are bad, repubs are horrifying!
But you obstruct @POTUS's Supreme Court Nominee every day ....so don't pretend that you are doing your job. #DoYourJob
You didn't support the troops when you voted to keep them in Iraq indefinitely. http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/Senate/Kentucky/Mitch_McConnell/Views/The_War_in_Iraq/ â€¦
what are you talking about?
Master of Irony #DoYourJob #lawlessmitch
You're ALWAYS screwing over the troops - Take responsibility for Your own actions! But then who could u blame?
McConnell, what a surprise!! You actually disagree w/ Dems? HA! Then why do you act like a liberal on policy?@Hardline_Stance
Really it was as easy as the GOP bigots not voting against discrimination for some of our citizens. Tell the truth or resign
Hey bigot Stop lying! @GOP creates vets then votes against them every time #DoYourJob
how could this tweet end well? @GOP hates giving Vets anything.
EXACTLY! Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! Geez!
fu
I wonder who they learnt that technique from?
do your job and quit complaining
Mitch, please! Zika, SCOTUS, cancel recess #DoYourJob
they learned well from you...
Bullshit, Yertle
