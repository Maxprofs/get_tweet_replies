Who do you think works in poultry plants in Arkansas? Who do you think works on farms on Arkansas? Who works in construction?
Wow! U r  now being associated with a racist white nationalist and you are promoting it on Fox News. Guess you don't want to keep your job.
It is being reported you slipped in 50,000 refugees a yr to this plan is it true? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Lying to your constituents.. Immigration doesn't push wages down, you and @realDonaldTrump busting up unions push wages down  #shameshame
Whose going to take up the slack in the construction trades?  Who else can bring that kind of work ethic to the table?
Reminder.  You were an embarrassment at senate hearings.  You wrote a bill that is blatantly racist.
Awesome job U are doing for us.. PLEASE don't give up.. bc we are % behind You!!
How about our so called president learn to speak English before he requires legal immigrants to do the same? #babblingidiot
Thank you for putting American citizens interests first.
USA can't continue to allow 1 million people in each year. Please watch @NumbersUSA explain why:
I hope Arkansas votes you out.
You should call it the raise the Nazi agenda
stop shining isreali boots.u work for others interest and mainly yourself not American and for surenot Arkansas
How about our so called president learn to speak English first senator! #babblingidiot
I hope there's H1B reforms.  This sounds great.
I can't believe you are proud of this.  So gross.  2020.
Thank you for saving our country!
45 supporters are like Jack and Jill rolling down the hill.   Enjoy your slide
If this doesn't pass Senate, will you resign?  Because I haven't heard any Senator come out in support.  You are a disgrace to the SEC.
Great bill. Thank you senator
100% you have not read it.
Excellent segment! Thanks for being a goodAmerican and a REAL REPUBLICAN! You & Price need not worry in 2018; some of your "colleagues"
Senator, how does it feel to know you are supported by white nationalists like @C_A_N_S_T?
Thank you @senTomCotton!

I am so embarrassed that you represent my state! How can you put a point value on a human being?!
Thank you for standing up Our party needs leaders that can lead
Why are you on a network that is faking news? Also your bill is dead. Not right and it will be stopped.
Shame on you for pushing such a bigoted proposal! This is not what America wants.   You are an embarrassment to Arkansas.
Traitor
Vote for E-verify.
Oh wow cool a US Sentaor plugging a last place news Network. #NoCommies #NoNazis #FreedomofthePress #ItsFunnyHowScaredYouAreOfJournalists
Hey Senator Cotton, would you please relocate to Nevada! We currently have a Rino and Dirty Harry Jr. We need real leadership in Nevada!
Tom is xenophobic. He only wants to be near other sufferers of alpaca palsy.
So many noodle armed traitors , so few hours in the day to make fun of them. #SenatorDumbo #ILoveForeignLanguages #CottonTooDumbToLearn
Thank you @SenTomCotton for being a REAL Republican
You seemed dumber and weaker than you did earlier today. I'm loving it. #SoWeak #GiveThisGuyAFitnessTest
I love destroying weak bodied Nazis on Twitter. Only bots and grumpy elderly people defemd them. #BuhBye #DustbinOfHistory #NoPutin
Whose more or a weak man, Tucker or Cotton? Hahahahahahahahahaha #WeakLilMen #Next #NoodleArmedBozos
Suck Rope YDF!   Racist Trash.
Oh wow yr going on the Nazi News network because you treasure propoganda and fear constructive questions? Yr a pathetic Senator. #Weak #Old
What #DonaldJTrump is doing with this new immigration bill Is flat out racial profiling people from obtaining permanent residency disgusting

Your nationalist xenophobia is just sad & a disgrace to America.
This is going to hurt many, many US businesses.
Ted Cruz Jr.
Chain family migration hurts US workers. Lower wages.Welfare abuse. As family of naturalized citizen we support Raise.Seen own fmly abuse it
How does this help the million high skilled workers already in U.S. but stuck in backlogs, many since 2006?
Another thinly veiled attempt at making America less brown? Shocking. Racist Cotton is racist.
Please try to get Mueller to resign.
As child of long term legal immigrants,my family supports Raise act. Wages are down.Low skill working 4 less cause way more than back home.
Based on all these comments, you need to explain it better. Nobody seems to understand it.
You're a clown
Just read details of point system. Could it be more ridiculous?  Points for Olympic medals? Promotes age discrimination?  Is this a joke?
Your math doesn't work any way you cut it.  Higher wages = higher prices. Higher wage immigrants = fewer high wage jobs.  Econ & Acctg 101

No thanks. I've had enough #racism & #xenophobia for 1 day. @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @vp

seems like a decent Bill with great ideas but will it get the votes?
Thank you for introducing a needed conversation on the public forum.
What a great bill! DO IT!

the RACE Act will include a requirement for a 23 and me DNA test, if it proves that you're a member of the Aryan race you qualify right away
Sad 2 see you remain sycophant to the unholy triad of trump-mcconnell-ryan.
your wishes come true. How will it feel to forever be the man who changed America to anti-immigration? #shame
Power4ThePeople!
Trying to sell your awful bill on faux news?
The RACE Act (correct spelling) is intended to only accept Latinos and other minorities if coming to clean toilets at Trump Hotels.
Are you joking? Get off Trump TV.
The RACE Act, you just keep on misspelling it as RAISE is a clear racist, segregationist action intended to clearly favor white people only
No compassion for parents to bring adult children to America, but adult immigrants can bring parents? How does that balance out?
@mike_felan @TuckerCarlson 

Great Job Senator! Well done!
Thank you for fighting the war for our Republic. I an educated citizen appreciate your drive to expose truths no matter who they incriminate
My only question is:  Why wasn't this legislation pass decades ago???  #TheRaiseAct
It was overturned by Ted Kennedy's 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act. Fundamentally transforming demographics for voters. #RAISE
Awesome bill!!  #TheRaiseAct needs to pass ASAP!!
Great job on this Act!
Loved seeing you and hearing you on Tucker tonight! Everyone should be onboard with this proposal!  Keep it up 
I know working people with illness, you want to take ins.away. there is no safety net for working poor, which sums up workers in your state
These two together would not make a human.
Tom, my husband is a Mexican immigrant. He turned down a full ride to Stanford to go to Berkeley. He fights rare diseases. He belongs here.
I am so proud you are my Senator! Great work on this bill!

Wow. You're really this stupid? You know this racist bill will never pass but ur taking it on tour? Can't wait to see who takes your seat!
Tom is a GREAT person no rhetoric he gets things done need more like him!
Correction it's the Racist Act
Big fan Senator. Thanks for your service and great work
Thank you Senator Cotton for your work on this bill.  Very impressive leadership from you, Senator Perdue and President Trump.
You both suck
why do you think you know whats better for us than we do?
Agree with the Raise Act. But just wanted to note, I think you have the best posture in Congress.
Melania Trumps English sux, she needs to go back from where ever she's from.
Lol idiot she knows 5 different languages and speaks the well!
I don't know, just because she said so does that mean it's true. Who's the idiot now
Thank you for sponsoring this great work!
Discuss the age limit for being an intern, thanks Tom!
You are evil
We're with you @SenTomCotton but I'm afraid you have a VERY steep hill to climb. The Swamp wants more immigration not less.
The racist act!
What does Trump's balls taste like?
RAISE IS RACIST!!!!!
You are racist!  I hope I can help defeat you in 2020 i will do so!
If you see S Miller time to go screw himself and that he looks like Joseph Goebbels.
Can u cover #AwanBrothers while ur at it?
Bad bad hombres hard at work in. the fields. You amd 45 just screwed up agriculture
Good luck with all of this Tom.  If you can get @SenJohnMcCain and his cronies to vote for this I will be impressed
Racist bill. At least own it. Respect you more if you wore your KKK hat in public.
Thanks for working so hard on this!  Watching Tucker.
Bigot
You Rube
Great plan!! End dual citizenship and end the EB-5 program!!  @SecretarySonny @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake

How about a follow @SenTomCotton I'm one of your biggest fans
I became a fan when I saw him speak at the Sessions hearing.
He did a great job, had me cracking up!
Why doesnt trump fire mcmaster
Autocratic Distraction:  "Who do my supporters hate? Who can I get them to hate? How can I make the hated targets angry so they lash out?"
