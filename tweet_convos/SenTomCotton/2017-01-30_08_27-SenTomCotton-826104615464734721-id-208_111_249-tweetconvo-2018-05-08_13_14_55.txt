YOU ARE SHAMEFUL

regardless of the denial of basic human rights, which you clearly don't support, you realize this feeds isis propaganda right?
Do you remember why the pilgrims immigrated here? To escape religious prosecution.
you're as ignorant as Trump. This makes you ok with endangering our soldiers & citizens in the Middle East! #coward
you can research this stuff but most don't. Don't blindly follow.
And how exactly do they feel?  And how exactly do you know this?
thank you
I don't understand why u think current refugee procedures "harm Christians"?

zero refugees have carried out fatal attacks on US soil since 9/11 - how is that "ill-designed"? It's working.
we do vet them already - here's our system if you are ill-informed
He supports Rex as well doesn't care that Russia attacked us nor that 4 judges disagree with order. Trump yes man that's it
Also we've allowed more Christian refugees than Muslim in past 15 years- how does that harm Christians?

words from a true Patriot...you could learn something from the Admiral.
You were sworn in to defend the constitution. Shame on you.
U R  so NOT a Christian. Have you read the Bible? Have you accepted Jesus ? ! NO.. not if you support Trump's ban.
Whether or not u get reelected depends upon how u vote & whether or not u represent the voice of the people. #RESISTANCE

You are on the wrong side of this issue and history will remember this -even UR bosses the Kochs are against it
As a conservative who voted for you, I urge you to stand for American values and reject the xenophobic policies of @POTUS.
well, you told the truth -- it's a statement!  Full of faith in the prez -- not like it's your job to hold accountable.
"common sense measures"? Seriously?!! Madness more like. Mad men justifying their madness. Frightening.
Your career is over. As are the careers of all those who support tyranny. The #GOP is dead. #impeachTrumpnow
I agree let look very serious at these plus we in mcgehee have several people from Yemen here now how the f b I look at them
Perhaps you'll ask POTUS why the travel ban doesn't include any countries that actually, you know, attacked us?
From an Aussie that listens to the TK Podcast, Solid statement, thumbs Up!
http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-ban-boosts-isis-recruitment/index.html …  you KNOW this is bad for US soldiers.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Prioritizing Christians?!!
Well said!

keep drinking the kool-aid, Tommy #idiot
Senator- thank you. The American ppl support the President on these measures to protect our country!
This Arkansas native could not disagree more.
ok so you are a shifty human too...good to know
you basically are saying that Syrian refugees sshouldn't get help simply bc Christians get treated bad there...so assholey
majority of us support common sense gun laws- just extra measures #gunban is fake news too. What are your thoughts on this??
I salute you, senator, for calling BS last week.  (Mother of a veteran).
traitor.
These are the 9-11 hijackers.  All overstayed visas.  A new president needs to examine travel security.  I say SUPPORT HIM.
saw u on the tube. couple of questions on syrian refugees - WMD? George bush? Please Arkansas,can't you find someone smart?
I am following you to see how often you abuse being a vet to advance your self interests & put party before country.
.@SenTomCotton History AND your constituents will remember where you stood on this - the wrong side. Looking forward to the next election.
Having been in Afghanistan then you should know how dangerous this ban is. Sycophants have no right to govern. #kompromat
Outstanding!
Shame!
you are heartless. Shame on you.
Thanks for putting America first!
..We have no trouble with Islam. Islam has trouble with Islam.
lol have fun following @realDonaldTrump aka The Fake Ass @POTUS into hell! 
.@SenTomCotton I can't decide if you are more despicable or more deplorable.
don't expect to be back in office at next election, clearly you are not the man for the job.  #spineless #coward
.@SenTomCotton In reply, we ask that you read our letter mentioning your previous commitments
Thank you for being a shame to Humanity!!! #TrumpBan
you do not represent this Arkansan.
"And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt." Deuteronomy 10:19
If it's wrong to call the order a religious test, then you are calling Giuliani a liar. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-muslim-ban-rudy-giuliani-how-legally-create-islam-us-immigration-entry-visa-new-york-a7552751.html …
please support POTUS!
You do get that Iraq's our ally in the war against ISIS. And this impacted translators who helped our troops. And DJT=Big Dick
you should be ashamed of yourself!
It is not requirement to agree with EVERYTHING that is issued by the new administration... Well, not yet. #nomuslimban
is another rubber-stamp for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump along with Obenfhurer Steve Bannon #impeachtrump
asinine
thank you Senator for your sensible support for the president's order
a #Muslimban to "protect Christians" is entirely out of touch with the teachings of Jesus. #allarewelcome
I'm an Arkansan and wholly against the #muslimban You don't speak for me. #noban #nowall
My Senator and proud of of it!!!
Judging by this picture and many others, it appears as though MANY Americans object to the process that you discuss
US Policy in Middle East goes back way more than 8 years and has always been problematic for the region.
you got my vote again Mr. Cotton. Great job Tom keep up the great work. You are appreciated.
4-star general fighting ISIS with U.S. Army & lives in the U.S. banned. Visitors are NOT refugees.
We will vote you out. You do not speak for American values of justice and equality. Your complicity makes us less safe
joined the fascists, have you Tom?
as an Arkansas native I'm very displeased with your statement and representation.  Please do better! 
#coward Did you serve the US so you could return and help dismantle our democracy?
Please work instead on something constructive and grounded in facts that will actually help your constituents and America.  Thank you.
watched your heartless speech making fun of another man for his emotions. You, have no heart and a dark soul. Embarrassing
my financial advisor's is better
To my Jewish, Irish, Asian and Italian friends http://dlvr.it/NDlJ9K 
man I'm a little & I want to like you but this statement is so out of touch. Great on the podcast though.

Ever ask God to forgive you for what you did to Cassandra Butts? Ever think about her?
most normal people who served with Tom realize he went over as a coward. Who knew he would come back a bigger coward
My wife and i will cancel his non vote. He doesn't understand these people.
As someone that has been in a Muslim country I understand where they are coming from. Unlike Jim Clawson below.
My wife and I are behind President Trump 100%. You are our Senator and we love you. Great Job, Keep it up.
MAY THE CREATOR FORGIVE  YOUR LIES, MAY THE DEAD SERVICE MEMBERS FORGIVE YOU FOR LYING ABOUT THEIR  DEATHS, YOU KNOW BETTER!

@TheDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
@TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer R's accuse D's as being unreasonable.When in fact D's are being too nice to R's.
If they don't want foreigners vetted, why are the liberals taking so long to get to the vote for President Trumps cabinet mem.
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE IN THE ARMED FORCES, HOW CAN YOU STAND & LIE ABOUT WHO STARTED THE 2 WARS? YOUR PARTY DID IT NOT OBAMA!
Enjoy your senate seat for now.  You underestimate your constituents
ru native American? If NOT, ur son of immigrants too! USA refugee vetting is MOST rigorous ur jst winin points w constituents!
I will rejoice the moment your constituents vote you out.
shame on you.
Rubbish
ur promoting bigotry, reducing understanding from our Muslim brothers & ignoring that USA is country of immigrants
y r none of the countries involved in 9/11 on the list? Oh yeah, #SaudiOilMoney! U r a false flag patriot, self serving...
Shut up, you Chinless Wonder!

.@SenTomCotton except your exceptions weren't in the President's EO. So what are you defending? What are you actually saying?
Thank you Tom Cotton!
Arkansas should be beaming with pride to have someone like you represent them.  I hope other Senators will follow your lead 
You do not speak for most americans at all you sir are a racist
here we go racist card. Bless your little liberal misguided heart.
just backed the #MuslimBan on senate floor. @maddow
shame on you
I strongly disagree with your statement and am disappointed in you.
You provide a bright spark to the Republican Party. I hope all Republicans will harness your talent.
we already do take a "hard look" at refugees. That's why it takes them years to get approved to come here!!!!
We need more Senators like you
Your reasoning is invalid and you are wrong to support Trump on this issue.
seriously you are drinking the aid too? Sad for you and your state
supporting our President and agreeing on this particular exec order makes you a great representative of American people.
If you are so concerned with national security, what are you doing about Russia and Putin?  They have already attacked us!
.@SenTomCotton Not wrong to call EO a religious test when that's what Trump called for - a #MuslimBan:
Canada has accepted 40,000 Syrian refugees, the U.S. only 10,000. Cowards like @SenTomCotton want to hide from the world. #PencilNeckGeek
.@SenTomCotton Wondering why our elected reps don't already know we have an "extreme vetting" process for refugees:
do you regret the pain you put Cassandra Butts & her family through?
Tom, you need to join the American people in fighting Trump! The people of Ar are watching and waiting for you to grow a spine
trumps lacky boy
well, I am a moderate Independent voter and I think your response is naive.
Thank you!
Another Trump and Party before Country statement from you Senator.
"Christians and other religious minorities who've suffered from genocide in Syria"since ur comparing...http://www.npr.org/2017/01/29/512305163/fact-check-trump-tweets-on-christians-isis-and-vetting-miss-the-bigger-picture …
Spot on! @McConnellPress Pls have #FakeTearsSchumer stop this nonsense...
Trumpster is making the US look like fools! Impeach him now!!!
No time to wait, I'll tell you the answer: it's zero. Why ban Muslims from these countries?
Could you explain 2 public the attacks committed by Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen refugees? I'll wait...
Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.
John Stuart Mill, 2/1/1867
I'm disappointed that you would back an EO that is outrageously offensive and marginalizes Muslims.
suk
Actually many Americans  #resistTrump policies. #noBANnoWALL #sanctuarycities @sentomcotton 
U just blindly defend @POTUS while whole world is against #MuslimBan
Traitor Tom your opinion sucks like your judgement
GOP is obsessed with stripping rights and not having any backup (unless white, male, and Christian).
Read a book maybe one on WW2! Hitler waged war on an entire religion! It was called the Holocaust, and this is how it started!
Weak stand. Stop waiting for others to lead.
So does "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" only apply to Christian refugees?
your boy trump  Will Take Down the whole GOP trade war looming, fights with China, Mexico, etc, what up gutter snipe types
Interesting that this EO doesn't ban Christians from these countries? Can you also explain that? Why target Muslims?
Mind explaining to us how many terrorists from Trump's targeted counties have committed attacks? I'll tell you: zero
What part do u moronic republicans not understand, no one hears you, u ppl gave the checkbook away. This man has all on his
weak stand up for what's right we will remember next election!!
It's not a common sense measure when you're targeting Muslims and banning them from the country.
The Refugee vetting process is incredibly extensive. Call Trump's EO what it is: Fear mongering and against American values.
Thanks for supporting our President. Great example for Senators McCain and Graham to follow.
I wish we had intelligent senators in Massachusetts,like Tom Cotton. Instead we have a couple of IDIOTS!!!!
I'm confident as an Arkansas who votes in every cycle that your response horrifies me. Our vetting is already 2nd to none.
congrats on supporting policy initiatives that will incite hatred and increase likelihood of attacks on our soil.
if your goal is to make us safer, you're speeding in the wrong direction down a one way street.
It appears Finland and Norway did their own work and determined these countries caused them the most violence and crime
Do U realize Sen Cotton most people in AR can't afford cable tv Veterans like myself can't afford to live & eat & pay bills
I'm married to a veteran in Ark. we are able to live,pay bills and eat. So I don't know why you can't.
there R a lot of young people that do not have jobs period, there is no industry, unless U work 4 gov't, Wal Mart!
There's a 20 point check involving UN, Multiple agencies, biometric scanning before refugees enter US.  Where's the problem?
We all know you are aligned with the Mercers and their Christian Supremacist agenda.
CAIR has ties with them and protest organizers. People are getting hurt, please help.
Are you saying @SenJohnMcCain and @LindseyGrahamSC are "liberal politicians"?  Not sure I agree with you on that Senator
Thanks for supporting our President!

Can we get @SenTedCruz  bill passed on declaring Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. Emergency meeting of Congress
known terrorists have come from countries not on the ban list. Trump has financial interests in those countries 
I wish the #MSM would have you on for interviews to present your opinion. There is a huge misrepresentation on this message.
Great statement..For President Trump & the American ppl! Standing with Sen Cotton
Yes!  Thank you!
Amen
Love it , but would you tell McCain and Graham to follow the president ! Traitors !
It only bans refugees from Muslim countries and gives specific preference to Christian refugees. How is that not a test?
thank you for the support of our @POTUS
racist
