100% of Cuban people have food, shelter, healthcare, education, employment, military training. Compared to #USA abysmal record
not to mention highest literacy rates, lowest rates of baby deaths, enormous cultural and artistic achievements.
else you'd still be a colony of Britain and talking Iike Brits. Actually that would be an improvement eh...
Maybe. Good thing America had unlimited resources and slave capital to get established.
If hard work, long hours, low pay are the ideal, descendants of slaves should own about 90% of America
Good lord.  That is one pathetic, shameful comment coming from a US Senator.  .
@BillReeceDale @SenTomCotton reminder that he's also the one who took a million dollar bribe from a foreign govt. he's a traitor!
reminder he also said Iraq war was necessary and justified..
so the people miss the good old bush days?!  What a shame.
Yup.
@TonyKatzCigar tom cotton  is a wiener he like balls in or around his mouth
agree!
Saddam,Stalin and Hitler have finally got a fourth for bridge at the Devils Club.
Ha....
@BillKristol Come on! I'd hardly call Castro's government liberal. In fact in some ways It was ideologically very conservative
Amen!
@ericdchristen
as a Christian I am horrified that you posted this! You should take it down. We don't know what happened between him and God
We have a pretty good guess, though.
Don't think we should guess, as a Christian you know we all stand in need of His Grace & that's from the CROSS
@gmiller1952 Thank you Senator. There is a heaven and a hell. Maybe if Fidel chosen baseball instead of revolution, who knows?
@railboy63 @CNN@MSNBC@FoxNews@CBS@ABC SEE ABOVE TWEET!
@BillKristol bingo!
.@SenTomCotton @DocWashburn From the NJ outlet HudsonTV: http://hudsontv.com/is-this-fidels-new-heaven/ … Fidel meets his new boss.
@JudgeMoroz our part of the world He wrought havoc. The people sit on streets.no jobs,no freedom & are sad. Very sad to see:-(
@perry1949 That which sow so shall you reap.
Cotton in 2024!
white racism has  been creating hell for blacks in America.
AMEN!
p.33 "Because there is no food!" interrupted Tata like a fury . . .Cubans live with privation 50 yrs.  Castro: hell-spawn.
@DrKissler und unsere @Die_Gruenen so: #Irre
@gato_gator Perfect!
@cliffordbrown God will judge. Don't presume. If he repented, he, too can be saved.


It's the least he deserves. I hope he suffers, just like the poor in Cuba.
@DarHuddleston Stalin tweeted last night that Fidel checked in. No cigars for eternity. He has to sleep with Nikita.
Just no.
Lol
You hillbillies just elected Trump..
Lol
I remember Devil Bush on hearing hell. You are another devil who supported him.
I just said the same thing to someone else earlier. Castro WILL receive double 4 what he did 2the people here on earth
Trump wins, and the left trots out their heroes.
@peddoc63 I bet some pharma co owns you
@peddoc63 Fidel gave free health care education gave land to its people you are forsale like whores on Craigslist for lobbyist
Thank You for your serve Tom Cotton
Cuban healthcare
Cuban healthcare
Cuban healthcare
don't think he believed in heaven or hell RIP EL COMANDANTE

No he is dead now! #TrumpLapDog #KochWhoreCotton
It is a sin to presume the state of the soul of the departed. Not that neocon Cotton has idea of Christianity. @wrathofgnon
don't judge, only God can do that. #hypocrite
While and the Iran 47 were undermining our President,  Obama was busy creating new opportunity for Cubans and Americans alike
The Grim Reaper finally comes a calling!
best statement yet
Citizens are not fleeing the US shores in rubber inner tubes in shark filled waters to get to Cuba!
Amen
@magasouthern As of 10:29 EST 25 November 2016....To Be Exact!!! Shaking hands with comrade satan!
I have to tell you, if he just regretted all his bad doing before death, he will be in heaven now and laughing. Read John 1:9
and Congress created hell on earth at #GITMO
and hasn't yet closed it
cc: @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JamesPindell @SenThomTillis
Because you know the mind of God? Right?
wow! I read some of your responses, and there are some crazy people in this world.
don't judge, who knows maybe he found forgiveness.  Probably not, but who knows.
Hopefully U will remember, Muslims R full Citizens of USA&No Tyranny should happen2them7share with Congress.
Mr Cotton has never said Muslims are to be held to different standards under the law.. Stop shaming good men.
@OptionsLandlord 2/2 In response to Bay of Pigs, our attempt to overthrow Fidel, he joined hands w/USSR. Batiste was worse!
@BillKristol  Just like you are assisting in creating hell for the Palestinian people. 30 pieces of silver or was it 1 million
@OptionsLandlord You're so misguided Senator. Cut thru the myths to the facts. U.s. Blew their chance to work with Cuba ...1/2
thank you sir
And the decades of embargo had no impact whatsoever. What color is the sky in your world?????????????????
Disgusting hypocritical criminal capitalist pig. @SalenaZito
@BillKristol you'll see him there one day Tom.
.@SenTomCotton @INTinaT God will punish this scumbag! Libtards celebrating his demise are evil!
@BillKristol Or, he will literally rot away in the ground, with no conscious understanding, because he is no longer alive.
b worse then any1 could imagine and it'll be never ending,no way out,he made his choice if that's where he is
@Melly_FL now the new incoming government lead by TRUMP can help these beautiful ppl.
yes yes yes. Let'see Irak
@wfletch65
@BillKristol as a traitor to ur country, don't know where u get off being morals judge.  Hope u don't rep the GOP.
Amen
@BillKristol #pandering
Even if you opposed Castro this is quite extreme from Cotton
@BillKristol it's up to God not you.
@BillKristol And So will the USA under Trump.
with hopes u 2  will soon experience that same agonizing torture. U have no idea how much u r despised-& so young. 666 u r.
.@SenTomCotton @BenWeinthal 

Yet some American "leaders" respond like this:
In many ways, after 1959, the oppressed the world over joined Castro's cause of fighting for freedom & liberation-he changed the world. RIP 
.@Marc_Leibowitz @SenTomCotton @BenWeinthal Says everything you need to know about Jesse's goal.
@BillKristol the funny thing is this nut job actually believes in hell. Help us all.
.@SenTomCotton @BillKristol Decades long futile inhumane blockade hd nothing to do with hell on earth in #Cuba.That was all #Castro.#Sarcasm
Good Riddance to a brutal another brutal despot.
well said
@BillKristol and the US backed every Latin American right wing dictatorship who created hell on Latin America for years
@BillKristol and you keep you lips tight on Putin
#LatAm rich socialists leaders Fidel Castro pupils accomplices Foro De Sao Paulo ALBA thugs adored by #liberals #progressives
Unaware he turned Cuba into a silent, black Oblivion.
@BillKristol have travelled there , people were quite healthy & happy.
true
Real Christian of you, Tom
@BillKristol how clever you are?
is still the major cause of hell in America and on earth for the American people.
you should stop short of casting Final Judgement, as that belongs to God.
mighty Christian of you
And will be meeting you there in due time.
I don't think he will. I heard he had died yesterday.
@shelliecorreia :JustinTrudeau says he was a friend of the family & great orator! Just another misunderstood soul. Right JT?
Hey Tom, if Castro is in Hell then you and your party will soon occupy the sub-basement of Hell.  Hope you like it warm, clown
now trump regime will take over
@AnthonyBialy A+
doesn't God decide about the fate of all his children?  You are not God. Nor do you speak for God.
Damn, can't imagine a better way to say it! 
By those standards, George W Bush is proper f**ked when he dies.
The only "hell" in the Bible is a TEMPORARY place. Try some research--God gave you a brain and wants you to USE it!
@fadeawayonu My FBI source tells me they are close to recommendation for charges, HRC is in last ditch effort to avoid jail
Lol! According to the BIBLE (which you've NEVER read!) there is NO HELL! Made up by the same folks that invented the Rapture!
https://www.ucg.org/world-news-and-prophecy/the-rapture-a-popular-but-false-doctrine …
Considering the hell you've created in AR & the US, I'm sure Castro'll greet you "warmly" when your time comes. #arpx
I've seen good Cuban ppl die to get to Gtmo and USA. Yet, some "Americans" herald Castro-unbelievable.
and it's exactly where you will end up
Arkansas the poorest state in the US 30% + pop. living below poverty line. Check your side of the St before running your mouth
how hard were you when you typed this?
yes he will
You got it!
"BOOM"  WELL SAID.
Well said!
If there was such a place as hell (there isn't) we'd all rather see you burn. The thought of you rotting in hell is delightful
Um... no, he's dead.
The DEVIL already had a place for him.
@AmericanSniperG yep...
@McCarthyThe3rd to be honest they weren't having a very good time before
What church do you attend?
"bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you"
@FactsVsOpinion nope, he's just worm food now like all of us will be one day

well said.
Irak is nie à paradise..@SenTomCotton
"Free speech zone"
With all due respect @SenTomCotton, given America's long record of oppression including lychings who are we to judge #FidelCastro? #Cuban
Who called you to give you the news?

Hell on earth? Isn't that what the GOP is trying to do for all the non-white non-male people in the USA?
@NoneYa777 must be a really sad day for Obama, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie. Like a mentor passing in front of their eyes.
bullshit
I bet you can't wait to meet him now!
@NoneYa777
@noclador
@StacyBrewer18   Castro will live in the 9th level of DANTE'S INFERNO
Tom? You think communist Castro deserves Hell but you're OK that Communist Russia manipulated our election??
you're foil hat is leaking
thank you Senator for voicing on the side of #freedom
Surely you are being sarcastic????
Donna - You obviously aren't familiar with what Fidel did when he was in power.
radicalized Christianity is a cancer on the world
@JewhadiTM amen my brother, payday will be a bitch for good old Fidel
The US created hell in Nam, Grenada, Pakistan, Iran, Chile, Salvador, should I go on?
your embargo did. Disgusting how false you all are! If he was a brutal Pinochet you would not complained, right???
@DenaldJTrumpJr Cremate the bastard and dump him down Havana's Septic Tank!
You and Huckabee can really say some stupid things Senator.
don't forget Carson....and the president elect!
sounds like your talking about the Governer of South Dakota and the US Government. #StandingRock #OilAndGas #Tyrant
free healthcare and free primary education?
you would be well advised to leave the damnation to God Almighty.
Really, Tom?  And who is creating hell on earth for the American people?  I'll give you a hint:  Republican Party.
If you knew history,hell was created by our embargo against Cuba.Kennedy had extended his hand before dallas. Smart man.
Bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it pays off for you....
I'm sure Donald Trump has learned a lot from Fidel Castro. Are you willing to protect the American people from Trump?
Castro will go to heaven before Americas Republicans\fake Christians
How dare you speak for the mind of g*d.
trump = to America what Castro = to Cuba.
You are a joke, comrade. Hell on earth is Arkansas.
As if you will be the judge of what happens, contrary to what you believe you have no idea what will occur.
agree he created 'hell on earth' but we are not ones to judge his destiny assuming that is what you are referring.
.@SenTomCotton for you to use this as a political thing to make yourself sound tough, I suppose, is beyond comprehension as a Christian!
Dude, you are so strange. That is no way for a statesman to talk. Grow up.
your so right about Castro . Fidel  should let the pimps and Mafia keep control of Cuba
Well obama and company (closet American communists) are already trying to whitewash the murderous dictator
FUCK Castro&Fuck You @binjabreel 

sorry @SenTomCotton @DenaldJTrumpJr American communists are showing true selves btwn Nov8th&now today
He established free Healthcare and University for ALL Cuban citizens. Impoverished were due to USA's embargo
you will be the one looking for him in hell. And you will not find him there.
like a pol that thinks it's good to pay fast food workers 22k and call them managers so they can't get overtime working 60hrs
there are many levels of evil Tommy
@katiebergey Tom is a savage
Fidel and Chavez can wallow in mediocrity for eternity now
Good thing Putin replaced Castro with Trump eh @SenTomCotton ???
True but Jesus is only judge so I will continue to pray for his soul.
