I've read good ideas from@SenTedCruz,@RandPaul,@SenMikeLee.  Do what's right 4 USA. Universal HC isn't it. #FullRepeal! #UnitedForFreedom!
Did you have a woman in a wheelchair arrested for protesting about health care? What kind of person are you?
So when do we see headlines "cotton arrests wheelchair bound woman fighting for her life?" Campaign ads anybody?
Btw whether nor not you called it in, this happened at your office. Surly a senator would at least weigh this and respond to the community?
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare or other socialized medicine! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
Just learned you helped with the AHCA bill?! Shame on you Tom
Do you also applaud banned pesticides being sprayed on crops again? We know where you stand, Tom, w the rich and corporations.

In return for faster approvals, please hold the companies accountable for lower generic drug prices. Prices are out of control.
Cool, I'm glad some Benadryl will stop my chronic illnesses that my healthcare can't cover. You wanna stop killing your constituents?
Doing a wrong thing is worse than doing nothing... #FreeEnterprise #Bible #Constitution #Liberty #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom #NoReplace
The GOP ran on full repeal. Get on with it or get out. #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal on socialized healthcare in America. #UnitedForFreedom
...... are you ok with poisoning Arkansas. Oh yeah, your a corrupt Republican. What happened to your party. #RepublicanCorruption
Do you applaud the EPA going against its own scientists to approve a pesticide after Dow CEO meet with price Price......
When did it become against the law to peacefully protest? Please tell me this? Are we UNDER A DICTATORSHIP? Are we under RUSSIA RULE?
Hope they do the same for medical devices!

It's easy to expedite when you don't need to review scientific evidence. Go Trump team. Beware consumers. 
TRUMPS LACKY. STILL HAVE $$$ LEFT AFTER HAVING DINNER WITH YOUR  KING? BETTER START SAVING- "VOTE COTTON OUT"
Have you figured out geography yet?
Sure, review the generics.  But let Big Pharma make its money first at sky high prices....
Are you going to have hundreds of thousands of us arrested? Is there enough room in your jails? Is next Concentration camps? Like HITLER?

Poll: Only 12% of Americans support the Senate health care plan! Greed over People.

We need competition to drive down costs. Big pharma is GREEDY.
I guess that leaves with with no choice but to drastically cut federal funding to the FDA
While dragging wheelchair bound constituents away in handcuffs. I'm very glad the internet is forever.
