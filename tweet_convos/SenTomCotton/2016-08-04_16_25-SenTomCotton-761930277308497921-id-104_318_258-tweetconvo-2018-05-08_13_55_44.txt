@Zelidasquare @SenTomCotton For all you Senate GOP that hate Trump, you have nobody but yourself to blame for his rise.  Go DJT!
@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton
Who is controlling the money in this country? Do you guys play board games all day?
I'd like to know where the hell a president can get $400 million in cash? How much do U guys miss?
.@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton @AlleyKat2 Or a secret #Arms deal #IranDeal
@Zelidasquare @SenTomCotton What's going to happen? Citizens that behave like BO/HRC Admins face punishment. If Gov't, nothing.
Do something about it!
If you can't spell or write complete sentence, don't waste my time.
THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!
Where did Hussein get the money? Who gave it to him? Congress?
shouldn't someone be impeached over this?
And what's going to happen now? Just a lot of talk as usual? This is a disastrous Presidency FYI.
@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton
why even bother no one will do anything...it's a disgrace
Banks don't do business with Iran. At least not banks we use. Cut the crap for once
@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton
@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton
it's like y'all are trying to discredit or blame someone for it.
so why bring this up,if you're apart of the story.so if in congress then you had some part in the approval
Did Sen. Cotton write a letter to his friends in Iran, letting them know the money was coming?
you cannot distract the public to the disaster that is @realDonaldTrump
1 billion sent to a W A R zone unmarked bills 2 Came up missing Did u get your cut
Of course. Did you want it advertised? Stupid party!
This type of poisonous commentary designed to create false impressions is typical of the GOP these days.
@HouseForeign What are you going to do about this? without any doubt this is a serious Crime Operation.

Was it Reagan's Iran-Contra money?
@BarackObama press conference was and is much more informative than your clown talk.  Need a snicker bar?
You people can't even spell "truth." #DoYourJob #SCOTUS #Garland How about working on that?
This is why
That is one full of shit conspiracy theory.
You need to shut your mouth!
Hey moron guilty of treason maybe the plane that said Hey Republican Aholes look up here was already being used
OH, sorry. You are a Republican, so you want to wage war with Iran, not bring them into peaceful co-existence.
Also, unlike a drug deal, it was the execution of a court judgement.
Only, it was openly announced during the White House press briefings in January, much unlike a drug deal.
Only you believe that it was a drug deal. You do not belong in congress. U R to stupid
Sensible people recognize it was ransom and Obama didn't want us to know. Why isn't he impeached?
BULLSHIT
This was fully explained and announced MONTHS before.
GOP propaganda has NO credibility
#GOPLies
#I heard that it was a wire transfer, not cash!
Where there's smoke there is fire.
.@SenateGOP .@SenTomCotton USE YOUR FACULTIES!! You wanted the details of this much in cash made public?!? #Iran #IranContra y'all forgot!
#Iranian #Hostage says #Obama LIED & #Ransom PAID

#ImpeachObama
.@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton And the @GOP continue to slide into irrelevance by pushing old, routine stories as if they had a new "gotcha"
Or worse a payment for ransom! 
How did Reagan do it?
But every time I want to withdraw or deposit $10,000+ in my bank account I'm treated like a criminal
This was a payment from an arbitration for the Iran Contra scandal. Look it up! More desperate GOP bullshit.
http://m.state.gov/md251338.htm 
Let's stop with all of the fabrication of the truth. Everyone 5 minutes of fame is over! Enough is Enough already!
Well, @POTUS just commuted 214 sentences for drug offenders so, he thought it was no big deal.
Really? Drug deal? Making up Shit is GOP Creed!
Just a suggestion that u not talk about a sensitive issue before u have all the information. What's your intent?
@Minuteman_1756 @SenTomCotton How low can you go?
You mean you weren't paying attention in January? Disingenuous liar.
oh please. That isn't the case and you know it. You're lying to the American public. Republicans = total joke
It's time to begin impeachment proceedings against Barack Obama.
no. You totally understand what happened here. This wasn't sleazy. It was part of a deal in Jan.
Unmarked bills? Sounds like a TV drama!
Delusional, out of touch, & pledged to be obstructive despite the will of the people GOP majority. #You'refired!
WHITE HOUSE

ANNOUNCED THIS

PAYMENT IN JANUARY 

GOP LOVES TO SPIN

EXCEPT WHEN ITS THEM
Do you hate our country or are you just ignorant?
BRAVO @SenCotton, as Obama was blaming repubs & right wing extremists in Iran, lol,U got special mention! 
Two words, Tom....Oliver North...have a nice evening.
.@SenateGOP @SenTomCotton The Rosenbergs were executed for far less #treason than the Clintons and Obama have committed.  Pls RT
And GOP has done nothing but climb in bed with @BarackObama forgetting they won the mid-terms.  Pathetic
let me guess and that surprises a Republican Congress and you wonder why we the people want new people in Congress
NOT Ransom...was "Workplace Violence."  Dems like to re-name things.
we will be voting against every incumbent of the GOP they can't do any worse
That's so credible.
Democrats in their usual attempt to govern and rule by their only means possible, $$$$$$ and ineptitude.
- illegal did congress know about Cash delivery ? Against US Treasury policy with sanction country !
if the treasury dept has that much cash,maybe seniors can get an  increase in their SS benefits. U think
- they could have given every American $1 million - I'd be ok with that -
- SMH and you wonder why the GOP is breathing its last. This is a good example.
how can they get or who authorized this cash we need new leadership you are failing miserably NO CONTROL OF GOV
This was sleazier than a drug deal.
