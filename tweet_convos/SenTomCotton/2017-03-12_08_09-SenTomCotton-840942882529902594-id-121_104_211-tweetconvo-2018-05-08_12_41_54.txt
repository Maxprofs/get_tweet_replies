So his main concern is losing the majority. Not the sick and elderly losing health care.Shocking
Not so shocking. He cares not about anything except lining his own pockets. #resist
Unfortunately, we have to put up with him (and others) until next year.
How much damage can they do until then, though? Frightening.
Too much. They're destroying my adopted country. 
can it be fixed. no.
Tom Cotton for President 2020
Never!
you should have been made to take Obamacare like the rest of us. Make whatever u pass your HC 2
All federal employees including congress shouldn't be excluded from any Healthcare reform bills
Mr. Cotton, I loved how you came very close to knocking that Libretard out on the Floor!
here in Arkansas we love President Trump. Mr cotton get on board or your done.
that like talking to the enemy! He twists everything
No free healthcare for illegals MAKE MEXICO REIMBURSE ANY MONIES UNTIL DEPORTATION+
@TheJazzy1 @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC did you find out there is no intelligence in the committee members?
only fear is losing majority in house? = we know the bill is "bad" for the people...Need more time to lie.
Why ?  @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC
Wonder what @ABC @Disney's ratings would be if they Hired Journalists instead of Political Hacks
Didn't really discuss, more like lied your way through the discussion, as usual.

Tom- great interview. Stand your ground; AHCA sucks balls
not much coverage on the NO RUSSIAN CONNECTION with trump!
as he says, "we need to get this right, not get it fast"!
why don't you tell Americans how Obamacare has been set up? All the land mines that are imbedded in the rules of Obamacare?
And I was not impressed. You appear to be a little sell-out & probably need to go by the wayside
Thank you @SenTomCotton @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC
Tom Cotton is a poster child for special interest. Please Arkansas, find someone with the interest of this country as a priority and not $s
stop running for prez for 2020 and be a senator in 2017.
I am a Democrat and don't agree with a lot of your policies, but I respect you so much for being a voice of reason #integrity
Health Insurance profits are legalized crime. #SinglePayer is the answer. #2018 #wakeup
@SenSasse glad to see some sensible, thoughtful, responsible Rs.  Bright future for Cotton/Sasse
#Thisweek Don't fall 4 #Tax Credit's,it's like having $1 in $5 store. No choice,not more #SaveACA #Healthcare
you should be more concerned abt how many will lose health ins vs how many @GOP will lose seats
This&vote4DeVos is why I'll do anything possible2rid AR of Cotton #DoYourJob
keep covering for trump and his Russians.If we make it past the next 4 years you will pay .
he's worried about GOP seats, not the cost of lives or $ to the public. Shameful
Stick to your guns - get it right!  From Searcy
I don't think President Trump would be for HC that is not affordable to the people.
LAST TERM TRAITOR TOM. Not Paid 72702. You will never be a Senator AGAIN. Make Ark BLUE again!
I demand the same healthcare you enjoy, Senator!!!
#PublicOption to save #ACA.
I totally agree! The bill sucks!
“I’m afraid that if they vote for this bill, they’re going to put the House majority at risk..." what about that people will DIE!!!
where can we see the the Health Care plans as it is being presented currently?
Pretty excellent interview. Very impressed with Tom Cotton here.
@THETXEMBASSY @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC you're the man Στεφανοπουλος...
not sure if I got anything out of your interview other than you wanting to drag your feet on helth care.
...his indebtedness to the Russian oligarchs..specifically, Vlad Putin.
My impression is that you're terrified of what Mr. Trump's tax returns will reveal about...
trump care is not only going to put majority in house in danger next year.. GOP is
I hope you weren't really thinking of running in 2020
PEOPLE OF ARKANSAS: COTTON IS A RINO-TURNCOAT WHO WANTS TO BRING IN MUSLIMS TO USA!
That's a fascinating assertion. How did you arrive at your conclusion? @BizNetSC @SenTomCotton @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC
good job, don't listen to these people that didn't even vote for you. Thank you for standing up to fixing this bill.
Repeal won't do that? Then once repealed those will be dealt with!
Give us 'details'! We do not understand your dislike of it!
Excellent job Senator Cotton. Very knowledgeable n articulate.
Russian ties investigation requires at least equal efforts as Clinton got.
as for the question of evidence, that's congress job, and George, your job is to look deeper.
for those naysaying Cotton, listen to what he said. Trying to make it better for all. Even you.
You're right, this plan will hurt a lot of Republicans; the working poor, elder care, 50-64 yr olds, etc. Bye,Bye WH @POTUS
great interview on both sides. @SenTomCotton sets a great example those who crave rationality
You kneel for Russia. Shameful veteran. What happened? I served in Cold War. You forget reality
Tom Cotton for senate majority leader.
I was hoping #SenTomCotton would punch that little weasel.

@BillKristol @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC Will you discuss GOP's role in undermine ACA? Dishing out responsibility?
good thoughts
becoming overexposed and therefore looking just like every other politician.
way to duck and weave your way through that last 3 mins. you are like a weasel trying to fit through a sewer grate.
So is Cotton in bed with Putin, too?  No independent commission?
Save the benefits of the ACA
Question RE: 45 bugged by 44 never answered. No tax returns needed?  really???
Please hold your ground.  We need more insured at a lower cost.  Healthcare cost must come down!
Excellent job. Articulate, measured, and as honest as any elected official dare to be on a Sunday show, regardless of party affiliation.
@BillKristol @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC George you were too easy on Cotton His loyalties lie with party first not country.
..And George would change his name to Clinton if bill would marry him
44% who go 2 our local Hospital in INDY   DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE! We're already 1/2 way to a PUBLIC OPTION!
And you rocked it, as usual! 
.@SenTomCotton @BillKristol @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC Very good. Stay strong. We need to repeal Ocare not just put lipstick on it.
@ThisWeekAB   So basically, you're more concerned with hurting the GOP than the People.
I agree this bill needs work
OK enough with Russian conspiracy theories. Take tinfoil hats sumwhers else
1) Sen Cotton U R 100%, Ryancare will B death of GOP. & @realDonaldTrump presidency. Not what Trump promised nor people want
2) What @realDonaldTrump promised was complete ACA replacement. Ryan's excuse Filibuster rule prohibits compl replace nonsense
3) No constitutional reqmt 4 60 votes 2 pass legislation. Force McConnell to revoke Filib rule on legislation @realDonaldTrump
Tom, who manicures your beard? That shit it boy band tight. You won't reply to serious ?s sooo
We should have the same health care options as Congress. Tax $$ supplmts. your ins
Healthcare by Trumpster is an abomination
still love the socialist idea that we own them free healthcare as a right! Dems ACA a failure!
Another GOP member with no soul
Pick a plan congress can use too!
HC looks to be DOA, if after 6 years you have no plan? Focus on Tax reform, while in power.
or at least do it after tax cuts
100% with you on ObamaLight. Please stick to your principles and get the House to improve bill.
Discussion =lies. ANYTHING  that comes out of your mouth can't be believed.  Until you call out Trump's lies, you lie too.
I am truly proud to have Tom Cotton as my senator.
