It's more tragic & ironic that many of today's marchers would refuse to blame Putin, despite his 17 years of power. Propaganda is powerful.
Russians are critical about everything in Russia—economy, corruption, foreign wars. But very hard to blame the one man in total control.
This personality cult, result of 17 yrs of repression, propaganda, elimination of all rivals & critics, is called "popularity" by dictators.
But the truth is in Putin's actions, his fear. Thousands of riot police & military vehicles in streets for every protest, large or small.
Even the strongest dictatorship is fragile if it relies on one man. Tipping point from fear to anger due to resentment, poverty, repression.
Support from abroad, even moral support, does matter. People want to know things can be better, that West isn't their enemy as Putin says.
Soros funded this?
You must be a liberal fascist. Putin is better than communist and Islamic left highlighted by Hitlery.
socialist waste. If you want death go to USSR!
Coward liberal clown, get out your mask.
@MattMcCollum68 Mr. Kasparov I am honored to tweet with a grand master like yourself, please be careful, he is a murdere
@ellieharvie I've been there today. Lots of ppl came. But guess what - no mention in Mass Media. NO at all. Fucked up gvrnmt
you were there?? There is no mention of it here in MSM yet. I only found on Twitter. Crazy!  Keep me posted.
I was! There should be. Some were arrested..Our gvrnmt keeps the silence cuz this is what it does when it's afraid. Great thing
...and #DonaldTrump can't wait to make this the case in #America as well.
Ur fame of chess G'master s passé& tarnished by ur pathetic thirst 4power& money tht 1st brought u 2Moscow fr Azerb'n,thn 2US.UR game's over
they are very brave people. I wish them luck
But you supported climate change denying @marcorubio & redbaited @BernieSanders - We don't need you to explain Russia to us, Garry.
@Ali_H_Soufan If there is a revolution in Russia, not good for Putin, and neither for those who are agitating. It will be hell!
@BeSeriousUSA He is the most dangerous man of this new century
Hopefully America takes him down after this shit-show he's caused 
Hopefully!!! But we are all fighting among ourselves. Feels like another opportunity to free Russia will be wasted
@AllyBrodwey He needs drop-kicked outta there-- too many fruitcakes in government!!
@BarnesDjuna I protest in the USA but I do not fear what Russian protesters live with they risk sacrifice  their lives.
Resistance is contagious.
I keep trying to explain to people that Russia has no "separation of mob & state."
Jeltsin must have been the worst a Russian could get?Catastroika et al.Those were the days.Jeltsin attacked his own parliament..
GARY - KEEP CARE OF YOURSELF - THINGS ARE GETTING VERY MESSY WORLDWIDE
@SenTomCotton what's your point? Putin can control US elections but not his own country
@nakanotekeko "I am Negan" the Walking Dead .... same thing, my way or heaven's gates, you decide
@iolverac thank you for the information! Best wishes to those protesting corruption and Putin!
when was Russia not corrupt?
@BillKristol Same guy Obama told to "Tell Vladimir I will have more flexibility after the election" Corruption is here too !
Putin needs to be removed from power.
Yes....
Corruption across the board/ocean, is corruption...hence, Trump and his clown admin...
and one day @realDonaldTrump will have to explain why he is #PutinsPuppet and hence #IlligitimatePresident
I hope so, too! Enough with their corruption and abuse of our government.
@yashar Who can mistake your opposition being murdered in broad daylight as an accident. Putin wants fear in the air always.
@normangoldman Trump wants to grab Pussy Riot
@KleptocracyIntv где были вы во время этих протестов? На лыжах катались?
It ain't us Penny & you know it! We're all good people through & through, left & right every one of us 
Absolutely.
Downfall (in the eyes of Americans) of trump for connection to Putin, could feasibly bring down Putin also.
@LauraJSilverman Yes! It's spreading!! Democracy invades. It's only a matter of time before they crumble and give in to change.
Wonder if Putin still thinks Hillary Clinton is behind all his opposition.
& all those brave anti-corruption & anti-Putin demonstrators are in jail tonight. Wonder if #Trump will react? (Or take notes?)
How about mind your own business USA?
western meddling paid protesters...we've seen this before....
You're very brave and honorable, Garry, but be careful.  Putin does not tolerate your kind of dissent if he has options.
what protests?  Putin media at work?
At least #Putin isn't replacing the native population with #migrants and committing #cultural suicide like #Europe.
Putin is the Russian Godfather
#trumpCrimeFamily. Retweet козырь Trump
 организовал #семьи преступления
@yashi_shiroma and Trump stays totally silent on the Russian protests
#Trumprussia #TheResistance
And yet Navalny billed it as anti-Dimon... To throw Medvedev under the bus and ease the presidential elections?
Putin brings it all on home....
& we thought Whitey Bulger back in the day was bad because of corruption. #putin #trump same page.
@libertythePD Putin sending message to Trump? See what happens when you defy a STRONG leader?
Most megalomaniac leaders (or anyone who's been in power too long) become delusional, and identity their own fate with that of the nation.
And GOP across the board is silent.
@margaritarr8 wish they would overturn him
WE WILL .
Russia has always been corrupted. From cradle to grave the 1st thing a Russian citizen learns is to keep their mouth shut
@Lynda143143 
I demand Trump tax reports for 20 years...
putin is the poo teen
We appreciate always the commentary - and the tweets. Not all tweets are as well-considered.
Senator Tom Cotton where is the White House response to these arrests in Russia?
@sadangelblue Putin is a dictator. And Trump is buddy up to him. What a farce. Has to be $ involved that what Trump worships
And TRUMP is where the BUCK stops HERE.....
Interesting that many Russians - like many Trump voters - think he's good guy. We need #FreedomOfThePress
AGREE
try to see something good in it..try to get something good out of it..Go
Trump wants to emulate Putin. Republicans are knowingly allowing this, with many traitors in place - and no one is stopping it.
@PaulBegala And @realDonaldTrump is Putin's puppet.
@PaulBegala where is Trumps tweets condemning this oh wait Trump owes Putin BIGLY
Just finished "Winter is Coming." Utterly brilliant and scary. Should be required reading for all policy makers worldwide.
@PaulBegala  What will Trump say about the Russians protesting Putin? NOTHING! Comrade Trump knows to toe the Russian line!
@johnmarshallnh #Russia is a great country just waiting to happen. #OverthrowPutin
@Raymond_Norman I don't know what you mean . I thought Putin was doing a good job . Remember Boris Yeltsin
isn't this D. T. croney? 
 Didn't "The REPUBLICAN PARTY" invite Putin into The Senate?  #DoTheMATH
Putin:  payback's a bitch, no?  Fas karma here.
@katherinefugate his biggest fear is people coming together under a common cause
@PattyArquette My heart goes out to the protestors. They know what can happen. Such bravery!
@shellbell_xo But more importantly if Russia hacked or even bought Trump then Russia is our enemy not friend. Acts of War
We are on same page w that Guy :))
@shellbell_xo Sounds a lot like Demo speech in America. I don't know enough of the facts but America has enough issues 2 worry 4
@Airella013 my heart stands w/the beautiful Russian ppl standing up against a muderous strong man in charge of a police state.
Mine too!!! I hope they're able to take their country back and kick Putin out, while we do the same with Donny!
funny how this is happening all over the world, an awakening that all strongmen Must be removed 4 world peace,Period
@GreatDismal Need to have anti-corruption protests here, against the Putin-inspired Kleptocracy in the White House
well said
Sounds interesting but I'm not understanding what you are trying to convey...
@CitizenKayS Take note America. Do not only resist, stop this cancer. Russians R willing 2 die 2 do so. R we? Freedoms not free.
about time-so Trump is going to help Russia be great for the 1st time
Garry keep up the fight, we on the left appreciate your insights
gotta admire their courage
I visited St.Petersburg as a tourist a year ago. A too beautiful city for the sense of corruption I felt during my whole stay.
@SenTomCotton Why are conservative republicans defending Russia over the US, why are they lying to us & hiding stuff?
@pap43221 45* has shown a bare ass on world stage, & maybe put a spotlight on putin's Authoritarianism. 45*can't change us.
many times a country's people and governments are completely different entities. Cultural and religious lines are embedded.
Corruption Protests Sweep Russia; Opposition Leader Arrested https://nyti.ms/2ojsCF3 
Maybe the #TheResistance is having a far reaching effect?
Putin is the state. The state is a beast.
@BillKristol  Exactly what Putin wants. The U.S. to sit idly by as he kills and invades the opposition to him. Another Stalin.
LOUDER! FOR THE N00B PUNDITS IN THE BACK! 
"Corruption is the system. Putin is the state"
@Kasparov63 @GreatDismal
Today's protests across Russia are anti-corruption, but make no mistake—they are anti-Putin. Corruption is the system. Putin is the state.
Russian Steel Giant Severstal @TMK #TMK TakeOver Canadian&US Steel http://cbonds.com/news/item/303553 … http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/3/1/1639223/-US-STEEL-COMPANY-OWNED-BY-RUSSIAN-No-wonder-NMPOTUS-Brags-We-ll-Only-Buy-Amerikan …
The U.S. must launch an international Anti-Corruption movement like the human rights campaign started in the 70s. #NoCorruption
Look out Deep Blue is coming for you!
@AmbKennedy_ret I am in awe of Navalny and other fearless dissidents. Russians are strong people.
@ClaraJeffery Be safe Garry. We need you.
@barryspoints I wish them luck and safety and pray for both!
Protest organizer arrested along w/100 or so protestors. Russians see Putin more clearly thru #trumpRussia scandal.
#Bannon + #BannonPuppet will watch Putin quell protests, learning what they can do to mirror here. #trumpRussia
So we pray as there is little else we have the power to do.
@NoTolls1 not sure about that one, during a survey most Russians like d and we're proud of him and hoped he would stay at top
@LovelyLowEnd is the same everywhere, here, democrats, all of them
@Linnie_33305 first rule about Putin...U DON'T TALK ABOUT PUTIN! A change must come from behind him...& he is 2 smart ...
@Evan_McMullin How do you see this playing out, @Kasparov63?
@Linnie_33305 unfortunately Putin can only be taken down from within.As he ages, he is growing more like Stalin Everyday!
Cowardly Putin can't handle opposition so he has them arrested.
@leasklaz more Americans reading what they think into Russian protests this is a GOV protest you guys give Putin too much honor
yes put Putin is the gov.  Will be interesting to see what happens to the opposition leader after his arrest...
I agree just don't like giving that name a voice those people have it real over there not like here in candy land
Very brave people.
: "Today's protests across Russia are anti-corruption, but make no mistake—they are…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=845961285942554624 …
unfortunately Putin will continue to suppress and murder to retain power
The open protest is good start. Cracks in Putin's veneer of power. People are fed up
If you'll get a power in Russia you'll steal the same. We can show it for the ukranian example. Nothing 'll change
Do you think the Russians see Putin weakened by his connection to Trump? Could this be why they act now? Or desperation?
@MasterMarquette If this is sustained, I would say looks like Putin got 99 problems.
..goos luck Russia.. When we talk bad about it.. we really mean Putty, Puti, Putee, Putkin. Okay, evil gangster.
Putin is the system my friend. The system is reflection of Putin's DNA.
are they even allowed to protest. i thought putin would shoot anyone who did. isn't he communist?
@BillKristol soros is everywhere
as he is the head of the corruption. He needs it as he has no other idea how to run the government.
@MMS1282
@jeffjarvis It would be wonderful if there was a clear solution.
If Putin died today. do you really think the state would be less corrupt tomorrow?
not without an honest leader , sworn to change 4 a better more honest Russia!!!
If Putin were suddenly disappear for whatever reason, would the resulting vacuum be even worse & who would eventually fill it?
Look at Iraq, is Iraq Any better without Sadaam, Hard Spot 4 The Russian People. But history has its way w dictators
@Evan_McMullin what ever happen to Pussyriot?
@GlobalRevLive A Kasparov endorsement is unhelpful.
who stole it from the Russian ppl & 2/3rds of Americans want trump investigated & booted from office- bc he is #putinspuppet
At some point this movement becomes to big for Putin to contain. It takes a lot of courage to protest in Russia.
Remember Ceucescu in Romania? He looked impregnable and was gone within days Putin still looks strong but who knows
The Russian people have only ever known autocrats. That losing streak can't last forever.
This Moscow protest might have more long term significance that we think. Putin's heavy handed response telling?
How can we show the Russian ppl that we stand w/ them against these global robber baron thugs? trump has taken  from oligarchs-
Look at the institutionalised doping in russian athletics for example, corruption pouring down from the dictator & his goons
seems to me that it is incredibly brave to march against Russian gov., even if nominally not anti Putin. Amazing, inspiring
Those ppl are very, very brave. 
@Evan_McMullin Thanks for your insight. You've been there.
@ammboston
Hope Putin doesn't find a way to kill them! Watch your backs protesters !
The world applauds these marchers. Corruption fuels politics of privilege across the globe. #WeStandTogether in protest. 
@Evan_McMullin My hope is that the power of the people will reign in both US and Russia! #resist
@Evan_McMullin @POTUS  will DJT speak out in support?  I doubt it.
any live links or videos?
@jeffjarvis if you were a russian you would probably be executed right now! Lucky you
Dictatorships are stable as long as the key people in power are happy with the rent. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1610391845/ref=mp_s_a_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1490531535&sr=8-1-spell&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=dostators+handbook …
@a_picazo explains the need for the oligarchs to diversify overseas
It is time for America to fully support their cause.
@Chopsyturvey He is Kejriwal of Russians.
@Evan_McMullin these ppl are incredibly brave given how enemies of the state are conveniently having "accidents"
or poisoned, no matter what part of the world  they lived in, Putin's reach knows no bounds!
2) Russia/Putin's role in world politics!  Bigger than Trump.  He's a pawn.
The sad thing? Many Trump supporters reject anything r/t Russia bc they fear it makes T look bad, MISSING THE POINT of
he is a hard nut to Crack.   His roots are long and deep.
It takes a lot of guts to protest in Russia. These are amazing people
Putin Rusya'sında bile yolsuzluk protestosu yapılabiliyor ise demek bu başkanlık sistemi o kadar kötü değil! #aktrolling #hayır
@StopFakingNews их цель сегодня - димон 
same here in USA: system is the corruption and Trump is the state. Bromance or twin brothers.
I wonder if this will be covered on @RT_com?!
they weren't able to ignore it! Not a word abt putin- it's all "anti corruption re: medvedev" Navalny arrested!!!
black is white, sweet is sour, yanukovich is batya
They are chanting "Russia without Putin". Brave people!
it won't be a surprise if these protests end like Tiennamin Square
i fear that is precisely what will happen. but i'm not sure the movement can be quashed. enuf is enuf
The Russian people are very oppressed. Few liberties. Very low incomes. Very high cost of living.
it's 1917 all over again. time to shake off this tyrant. it will be harder this time.
Each cycle, the tyrants perfect their oppressive techniques.
it's true, and putin's police [like ours] are more brutally armed than ever before.
.@Kasparov63 Today's protests #Russia r anti-corruption, but make no mistake-they are anti-Putin-Corruption is the system-Putin is the state

Qualsiasi disgrazia succederà nel mondo Garry Kasparov continuerà parlare solo di Putin.
do you think social media and exposure will help Russian protesters in their fight? I sure love reading about their fight.
check this out. u can see all cities
@Evan_McMullin Brave souls! I wish the US government was being led by sane people to address support.
Trump will be gone soone and Putin will learn that when you mess with the bull you get the horn.
Navalny has just been arrested for no reason.
one in the same, the worlds most subversive plutocracy
Is the anti-corruption protest against establishment GOP and Democrats? The king and queen of gridlock driven by corruption.
How long until the same protests are happening here?
They are brave people
Exactly. When we March against Trump's policies, we don't (yet) fear for our livelihoods or lives. In Putin's Russia, protest is dangerous.
That's why it's so important that we speak up now against corruption.  GOP sad they aren't fighting it. FAIL
