Your immigration legislation is un-american.
Certain quarters merely take pride in opposing even knowing adverse outcomes.
Very true.
Do you realize that a fairly large number of immigrants comprise USA's "best and brightest"? @SenTomCotton @SenateGOP @Democrats @HouseGOP
We have terrorist taking US jobs and tax payer funded college seats, the BAN Outed over 100 US companies
My senator's bill is un-American, un-Christian, and unacceptable! Colluding with Neo-Nazis in the White House
Please Senator Cotton address the 100% Muslim entrance w/ 0 Christians & other persecuted.
PLZ PUT IN THAT BILL .,THAT NO TAX DOLLARS GO TO WELFARE OR SSI FOR ILLEGALS & REFUGEES.,A JOB IS OFERED 1st
#altfacts alert! 

Reality: illegals don't qualify for benefits welfare, food stamps, or Medicaid
THIS HEAD CLOWN ALOWS IT TO GO ON BEHIND OUR BACKS.,TO KEEP A VOTING BLOCK TO BE RE-ELECTED
shame on you for selling your vote for DeVos. What is your price w/ regard to immigration issues?
Senator Cotton is a future President!  Arkansas proud!  Keep up the great work!
Oh dear God, no. The ambition is obvious, the qualifications, no.
Outside of the last election,  when did the most qualified applicant ever win the election ?
Did you really say "sounds like common sense from another Arkansas politician?"  Cotton and Clinton same-same
Of COURSE the junior senator from #Arkansas has been colluding with the literal Neo-Nazis in Trump's cabinet.
thank you!! @NumbersUSA @marthamaccallum
Rampant #H1B abuse-corp welfare? US has enough #stem talent. Tuition is big$ & then:
correlation between wage stagnation and never ending supply of minimum wage workers  must be addressed
please dont forget the bowling green massacre,
The @StateDept @Rex_Tillerson @DHSgov Muslim Refugees coming in the 100's w not one Christian
that they know about immigration without getting impacts on their lives.
I am welcomed to #answer any argument against anti-immigration statements because people belive
your bill will only create more segregation about what immigration is, and if any person who wants it
agreed that #immigration should move towards a more legal way...
the #DVprogram is a method many people go through in the legal means, and yourself as a #republican
the #agenda the president has on damaging the integrity and what the country stands on
#immigration is not a subject a rookie can tackle, however you proposing this bill only demonstrates
it is just sad on how people are moved, yet they understand nothing about the system.
the problem with your bill is that you are still not cutting the real roots of illegal immigration
I am saddened by your vote against the Arkansas public school system yesterday.
Why put a number to immigration or refugees? We should only accept those that ADD to our country. Zero that BURDEN taxpayers!
We MUST stop Tech firms from flooding in foreign workers who work for 75% less than Americans! Screw them!
Kudos for bill cutting immigration! With 94 mil Americans out of workforce, should be cut to 200,000/yr!
are there more of you friends perhaps that we can vote for,2018 some dead weight has to be removed from Sen.
shame on u for voting yes for #BetsyDeVos  and for taking her money to do so
our #immigration system is working! Stop lying to the #Americans!
Sat in room full of indians yesterday. Congress destroys high tech worker careers. Send them home too.
We need this guy to double as POTUS immigration n avisor and be s senator
: MAGA
keep this up and I'll move...To Arkansas. A 22 year ditto. You're the man. Thumbs up.
This needs fixed a.s.a.p:
http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/22/new-citizens-can-now-skip-pledge-to-bear-arms-and-/ … These new citizens should be asked to take the pledge.
He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly; he loves the foreigners who live with our people
also h1 b visas that force citizens to train foreign worker replacement must stop
that's not how H1B Visas work but don't let facts get in the way of talking out of your ass
about time, visa entry exit system and secure work force, end the non citizen welfare state.
thank God our public servants are finally listening #AmericaFirst
Great interview Martha & Sen. Cotton! Thanks! 
It'd be smart for Trump and GOP to legalize DACA and others in gesture go Latinos.
Keep promises made to these workers of immediate action! This sector is silenced but did vote.  @POTUS
NO
nice work Senator Cotton!
Correlation is not causation didn't they teach you that @harvard ?  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-25/immigration-isn-t-that-bad-for-native-workers … @OZRKIndivisible
Wish you were here
- Yup.  Trump embraces the Clinton agenda and the GOP has become Democrats - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixi9_cciy8w …
LYING TRAITOR TOM AT IT AGAIN DISGUSTING KOCHSUCKER .
Bill Clinton agreed in 1995 22 yrs later we're still waiting This is why so many are disgusted with DC

You are my new favorite senator!
totally agree, love @SenTomCotton
. #BEARDFAIL it's still the same traitorous snake under that pubescent boy beard.
I rather take the immigrants then u sir
What country did your ancestors come from? Maybe we should have not let them in either.
What does Speaker Ryan, "That's not who we are," have  to say about that? Keep your back to the wall.
