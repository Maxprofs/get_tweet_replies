The American people aren't going to watch that game show "Play the race card" anymore. This is
were used as sex slaves or when Bill raped Juanita Broaddrick & Hillary Clinton enabled his crime
YR you still talking about the Clintons? Obsessed much? Donny needs to stand on his own
all of Obama's destructive legislation & illegal Executive Orders. Obamacare gone!
your joy at the despair of others is exactly why you will never be a good person...sad
You don't know me Ginger; we've helped children via foster care & adoption, plus I
@TimRunsHisMouth @CoryBooker Hey Tom Cotton: now you're on the racist list too. Disgusting, all of you. Wake up!!!
Democrat leadership worked out so far in the inner cities? Chicago is called "Chirac
relevance? Check all red states and see how shitty they're doing. Whole states not 1city
34 states with GOP Governors as the American people are starting to wake up. And,
And their economies suck and they are being destroyed. Gerrymandering-look it up
And if you think Right to Work (for less) is good, I have a bridge to sell you.
I think that almost all Americans are worse off after 8-years of Obama's Presidency. Lowest labor participation rate in 51 yrs.
You've been lied to. The number includes retirees, students and home makers. Numbers much lower than exaggerated by R. Turn off Fox
All you bigots stick together.
We have been treated to eight years of the Democrats favorite game show "Play the race card", & that's
Funny how I never mentioned anything about race. Only you did. So I guess you're playing the race card.
so you don't even know what bigot means, you just use it reflexively. Way to prove his point
Bigots/racists are Democrats from their founding; slavery, Jim Crow, KKK/lynchings, plus
might wanna consult your blog, KKK, Jim Crow, etc, all conservative ideology,
Lincoln was a liberal. Any fool knows that.
liberal and conservative in their modern definitions are meaningless re: 1860
-And I expect you were delivered wrapped in a pale sheet via Avis Cotton's cancerous soft tissue inner tube. F/U!
You are a racist.
-Nonsense. I have Euro American friends that take care of my yard.  "Fine" people. 
Today's testimony the self aggrandizing @CoryBooker  is a stain on both New Jersey and the U.S. Senate
white supremacists like you deny racism even while you commit mass oppression of minorities. SAD!
YOUR TWEETING TRUTH! :)
racist!!
You are unworthy, unChristian, and disgraceful. And that's how you will be remembered. @SenTomCotton
he has political aspirations for 2020  ....the American people don't forget.
there is NO chance in hell @CoryBooker will win the Dem Nom for 2020 Prez
let alone win 2020 Prez
it will never happen
period
wow. You're scared
, is it far-fetched to expect AG to put justice ahead of law & order or to value Americans of all colors/creeds? #Bookerswords
Hey Tom, your sheet is showing.
Parenthood whose disgusting founder Margaret Sanger wanted to exterminate blacks. With 50% of black
now "she" just aborts their babies and makes a "killing" . ABOMINATION! "OBAMA NATION"!
I'm concerned that after all of the atrocities of Planned Parenthood
why is Rubio attacking Tillerson????
.@SenTomCotton my, my, Senator, what big gratuitous racism you have
Well, bigots named "Cotton" and states like Arkansas do go hand-in-tiny-hand.
Welllllll.....now we all know, he just made his debut as next left wing party candidate for president.
T-Bone? What does that mean?
Tommy, you are such a crooked, vile person anything you are against is automatically the correct thing to do
You only wish you had half the honor and integrity Mr. Booker has.  The GOP has already shown ethics, honor gone.
he was praising sessions less than a year ago!  Damn it doesn't take much to convince liberals
difference being I haven't seen trump praise Assange. He quoted him and that's it
I would give my right arm to see him drop you like a bad habit. #GoodGuys
Tom, I don't think you had your civil liberties violated before. My mother and I have in the natural state so it's not far fetched from Cory
the attacks on Sessions sound racist actually
@mlong42947 @CoryBooker Cory didn't get the memo that black is out for 100 years, because of obama policy
Truth is that @jeffsessions is anti-Civil Rights AG pick. His nom. sends message; we hear it (& you) loud & clear.
Didn't most of this alleged racist stuff happen when Booker was a zygote?
your master Trump is busy in Russia having orgys with strippers. No class or decency in the GOP
Sen Cotton, you sound like either the plantation owner or the manager of the trailer park.
@JasonMillerinDC @CoryBooker 
Sen Sessions deserves better! Booker is the true disgrace!!!
ABSOFUCKINLUTELY
woof this is overtly racist even for someone with the last name "Cotton"
racist much?
@EWErickson @CoryBooker Bravo!
This from a man who spearheaded and signed a traitorous letter against our country? T-bone has more character.
In this order: Apologize, Resign, Delete your accrount...
Sessions needs to be fully investigated and vetted.  Why are you afraid?  What is he hiding
is this a parody account? #WTF you're a Senator ffs
T-Bone! What is wrong with you! My goodness! First you lie about what the #ShitholePresident said; now you are making racist comments about a fellow senator. Go to your room and stay there! We can do much better than you! #Resist
Why do you think making a racist joke about a black man criticizing a racist is a good idea?
just googled T-Bone and Cory Booker. Apparently it's a thing?
Black people also say the n word but I would guess if alleged senator cotton tried to tweet it as a mean joke it would also go over poorly
That's an unfair comparison and you know it. I can't believe I live in a world where I have to defend a Tehran Tom tweet.
Taking a politician and reducing him to a thuggish sterwotype was intentional and the point of this tweet. Hard to deny that.
He didn't reduce Booker to a thuggish stereotype. He made a reference to a made-up character that Booker had created.
Tom Cotton is a tone-deaf, horrible person. But this tweet is bad bc it's a little-known reference, which comes off racist.
You keep failing to address the concept that the reference doesn't preclude the tweet from racism. It can easily be both.
.@SenTomCotton
Best GIF ever.
EXCUSE ME? Someone needs diversity training, stat.
, you'd rather patriots accept a tainted election? Thank you @CoryBooker for speaking in line with your conscience.
Don't call yourself a patriot, maybe a traitor.
, sorry for you that you can't respect a patriot who you disagree with.
calling an election 'tainted' is not the same as disagreeing. If Clinton won the same way you wouldn't complain
We'll never know if I would have complained about a Clinton win since Putin's meddling in our democracy worked.
by meddling you mean releasing accurate incriminating documents?
meddling includes hacking into computers and leaking info (including false info) about 1 candidate but not the other.
wow, what a shameless deplorable you are. I would apologize profusely for this utter shit if I were you.
Do you realize how racist you appear? The answer is "very". @CoryBooker
@donaldbroom Cory Booker is the kind of people that's keeping this so called racism alive.
not racists huh? Just the people who talk about it? Smart guy right here
Da fuq! Oh, little Tommy, we can see you under that hood! #SheetsAreForLaundry
apologize to @CoryBooker , the American ppl and resign.
Wow Sen Cotton... heavy racist undertones in that statement. Why T-Bone? Why not any there name? Shame on you.
he was a racist and now he's not?
Yo, Tom Cotton, you may want to change that profile picture with a sheet and some eyes cut out after that tweet.
...And your comment re: T-Bone does not represent you well sir.
Tom Cotton unlike you Cory is an outstanding American who believes in right regardless of color
He was praising Sen Sessions not long ago. LMAO Booker is a damn joke
Our junior Senator from the great state of Arkansas, you have spoken well!  @CoryBooker's questioning was REALLY far-fetched!
this is what bigotry looks like! Tom Cotton we are watching you! Sessions has long history of bigotry

Stop it, Tom. Not a good look.
why didn't Booker spout his "wisdom" in November . Oh wait.. no camera time
Wow!! @SenTomCotton Shocking and shameful. And the saddest part is that you don't care. #racism #SessionsConfirmation #shameful
wow! Do you kiss your sister with that mouth? #StereotypesHurt #StopSessions #Arkansas
Who is T-Bone???  You all act worse than my child's classmates with name calling and insults.  Grow Up!!
@MarkSKrikorian @CoryBooker 

The mani-pedi chemicals go right to the brain.
your lack of self awareness with this comment is absolutely stunning.
That's some pretty racist shit. Don't think just because Trump won it's now acceptable be this openly racist.
Mr Booker stood up for the people today, as all good Senators should.
Senator Cotton, you are an opportunistic piece of trash. I look forward to you being exposed for the garbage u are
Umm... your racism is showing. Embarrassing.
Nathan Bedford Forest would be so proud of you Tom. @CoryBooker
maybe you should ask John Miller what he thinks?
You support a Manchurian President. Until that stops, only assumption is that you put party over country
Cotton indeed
The showdown between you two in 2020 is going to be epic!
Thank you for always being honest about your racism.
did sessions not lie about his civil rights record? Why are you and he so threatened by equal rights?
The problem with democRATS is they are always campaigning, complaining or lying & never get anything done 
@CoryBooker
Sen. Cotton, racist much?
leukemia
@StacyBrewer18 @CoryBooker 
Jeff Sessions fought as Alabama AG to keep LGBT conference from meeting on a public campus http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/politics/kfile-jeff-sessions-lgbt-conference/index.html …
racist and Russian apologist!!
Bit of a racist, too, aren't we?
Well done, Tom! You just proved your own racial insensitivity in under 140 characters!
please apologize and sign up for sensitivity classes....
That's really racist.
LMAO
Sen Sessions is guilty only of being an Alabaman. Dems can't seem to get over the SHELLACKING they got in Nov.
.@SenTomCotton .@CoryBooker SEN COTTON PLEASE SPEAK LOUDER I CANT HEAR YOU OVER THE BANJOS AND CASUALLY RACIST JOKES

The Republican war against Christianity continues.  Why does @SenTomCotton hate America so much?
How do you not see this as racist? Do you not care? Cory Booker had the balls to stand up for what is right.
Please stop making our state look bad.
@JasonMillerinDC @CoryBooker hahaha yes so embarrassing
Said Session's fan, the man who stopped the last bipartisan immigration reform attempt.
Didn't Obama make up a girlfriend in his book too?  Anything authentic about leftists or is it all a façade?
Jesus that is a racist thing to say
His story of T-Bone didn't hurt him, but Session's real past kept him from a Federal Judgeship.
.  Really,  Cotton just disqualified himself from  possibility of ever being A.G.but then racist Sessions will get the nod.
@Dab7One @CoryBooker 
OT..Tom Cotton your Russia blitz on MSM last week showed ur true colors. True grit? Stay away from 
nobody cares about your fee fees, Tom.
Horrible, racist.  Cotton needs to apologize to Cory Booker and to the American people!
Tom Cotton has cotton for brains! #ShameOnCotton
So you're a racist too? Got it.
George soros and the left is waging a character camapin against the GOP
Hey Tom Cotton: is it hard to see and hear with your head buried so deeply in the sand? Do you ever look at facts?
.@SenTomCotton Cool to see that *some* Republicans are still so cowardly they blow that dogwhistle. @CoryBooker
found out T-Bone was going to testify for Sen. Sessions so he sent him back to Imaginary Land
@TheCLBryantshow @CoryBooker I think he was right on
I dont care abt your outrage, .@SenTomCotton. I found your words & behavior on the #IranDeal appalling. You're #DeadToMe. @CoryBooker
cotton is the Iranian pen pal!!! #kochpuppet
Cory Booker's testimony against Jeff Sessions was hallow, disgraceful & disgusting w/zero examples to substantiate
Politicians are disgusting individuals who will do anything and say anything to gain power. Today's display of your colleagues was evident.
so are you trying to say Cotton isn't in the same boat?
The Senator spoke the truth. Sessions is the wrong man for the job.
Cotton, U + Sessions are treasonous POS who belong in prison. #Failure Senator Booker is a true American patriot.
just because your leader @realDonaldTrump doesn't have class doesn't mean you don't have to. Be better.
I can't believe it was even tolerated to be honest. It's a circus.
Cotton doesn't deserve to be an American, much less an American Senator.
.@SenTomCotton @GeorgeMee @CoryBooker Yes me too...Cory Booker's effort to get his 15mins of nat'l facetime to promote run for Pres in 2020
Wow. You should be ashamed of yourself, Senator Cotton. You're a disgrace.
‘Your sheet is showing’: Internet pounces on Tom Cotton http://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/your-sheet-is-showing-internet-pounces-on-tom-cotton-for-saying-cory-booker-sounds-like-t-bone/ … #racistPOS
I worked a bank robbery once and one of the robbers said he borrowed the getaway car from a guy known as Chee-to.
uh, racist much? You can't say those things and think that's ok. You're a public figure!
you're a weasel
Remember that time you were a traitor, Mr. Cotton? @CoryBooker
You nailed that one, Senator!!!
So, you took the side of Sessions over  Cory Booker?? Enjoy your short stay in the Senate.
you sir, are the definition of deplorable.
@az_valentine @CoryBooker Cory! Your
a T-bone! Crap, and We the People have you on the payroll! What a waste! @FoxNews
The Democrats really showing their ass's
And the are so good at it!!!
.@SenTomCotton @CoryBooker @SenatorSessions Sessions "labeled the white civil-rights lawyer Jim Blacksher 'a disgrace to his race'.” SHAME!
Anyone saying such things is from another era, and should abandoned. What's your excuse Cotton?
@JasonMillerinDC @CoryBooker American people are sick to death of the race baiters! Doesn't work anymore!
what's a race baiter?
Wow, U R not much of a racist fck, R U? Expected no less from U, though. U'v already toyed w/treason, Y not rcsm?
Really, Sen Cotton? T-bone? #disgraceful
You are an embarrassment to humanity.
Wow, how embarrassing. You need someone to read these tweets and stop you.
@JasonMillerinDC @CoryBooker lol
, Sadly the facts are undisputed. The word friend is stretched when the people are not equals-Boss to Subordinate
@DeplorableJerry
We get the T-Bone dog whistle. We know the pointy, white-hooded sheet set you wear after hours is in your closet.
your president elect is a Russian operative
Truth hurts, huh?

@CoryBooker
I...can't...just...how...do you think it's ok to be this blatantly racist?  Just how?
your racism is showing senator, look a Session's civil rights record it's not exactly good
What has happened to the public discourse among politicians is disgraceful.  Start governing and stop bitching
you do remember that jeff sessions was once considered too racist for the reagan administration, right?
We are your constituents and WE DON'T WANT Sessions confirmed!  Listen to us or start looking for a new job!
Wow. So incredibly racist. 
Thanks for showing everyone who you really are.
is T-Bone a #pizzagate code word?
@jtLOL  I suppose you think that was clever.  It wasn't.
Google it.
is a man without a moral compass... @BresPolitico @CoryBooker
your statement is pure ignorance.
What a little sleazebag you are. Hope you'll be happier in Russia.
Cotton, you are repulsive. I won't even put the title of Senator in front of your name.
Your racism is part of the problem.  @CoryBooker
racist much? I actually feel bad for you.
you really shouldn't be a leader in the US. Have you considered Eastern Europe of the 1940's? #embarrassment
racist much?
delete your account
Racist much?
You're a goddamn racist!!  Just like your leader Donnie.
I'm glad I'm not a politician.
ahaha. Nice
While that plays well to the ignorant who elected you, thinking America knows you are supporting a Klansman.
It's RICH, coming from you, to suggest Booker might act out of political ambition rather than conscience. I'm ashamed you're my senator.
you racist POS.
Get a grip, Cotton -- you're so far up Trumpy's butt your feet stink.Stop supporting a known racist. #NoKKK
perhaps this will help, senator. http://bit.ly/CorettaKing
