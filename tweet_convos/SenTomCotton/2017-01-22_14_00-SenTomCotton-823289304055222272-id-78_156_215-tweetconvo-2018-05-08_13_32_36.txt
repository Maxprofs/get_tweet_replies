The #IranDeal MAYBE dead @SenTomCotton, but $1.4 billion in cash is enough to buy readymade nukes @dcexaminer http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tom-cotton-the-iran-deal-is-dead/article/2612295?platform=hootsuite â€¦
Tweeter in Chief position is already taken

HEY TOMMY, CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?
you, my friend, are a true patriot!!
*israeli* patriot
No, it's not.  #NoMandate
you committed treason with that Iran letter, fuckboi
Finally, a man with balls. Good for him!
@AlysiaStern @dcexaminer @DavidMDrucker Hasn't Iran already violated it??
I loved you in Road Trip, Tom!
so Trump is going to ask for a refund?
@BigBrotherNoNo @dcexaminer good. Just seen news that Iran getting missile parts
To anyone who might see this: Know that Cotton is an anti-American fascist. A truly awful person.
I noticed you didn't want to answer my questions, lol.
America no longer keeps its word to the international community under this group of vagabonds and thieves.
Arkansas voters should know about this.
RESIGN!
Tom Cotton is the real deal no pun intended
@Ster24080753 @dcexaminer Well done if true!

why do you want Iran to get nukes?
Why is cotton aligned with this group that killed Americans?? Ask him!
leave #irandeal alone - it's working. How about you try to stop #NorthKorea from getting #nukes ?
bad move on Iran deal
sorry but your a Republican, so your about as trustworthy as a used car salesman!
like the @POTUS you only share things about yourself. You are self-centred and don't deserve to hold an office.
READ "Tom Cotton: I backed the wrong horse and my days in political office are numbered."
@BeladonnaRogers @dcexaminer 

Good
do you regret your cruelty to Cassandra Butts?
We send 3.8 billion tax payer money per yr.2 Israel.They send spies to USA. We caught them. Why do u support that?
@https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/823328925027856387

I think we have plenty of reasons
you even miss quoted your tweet from article is the an alternative fact? Mnuchin r u for a man who foreclose active military?
Guess you did not care to talk about the protests? What about Trump taxes? Go on record on his COI. Russia ties?
Dear Tom Cotton supporters.The Iran deal has reduced Iran's nuclear capacity significantly. He's a false prophet
cottons claim to fame ? 400,000 votes. That's it.
are you mean, bro?
Why?
Many   citizens born/lived in Tehran have O&G roots that they run deep. WWIII is NOT an option #47traitors

and so is your career
You, Comey and Trump are traitors to this country
Great now what? You seem to do a lot of taking things away and destroying things. What have you done specifically, what bills?
Senator Cotton is the best Senator in the history of Arkansas, perhaps the US!
Why do you support terrorists that killed americans??  Last March mtg??

guess you forgot to look at the results of the deal. It's called being pig headed.
No thanks. How many times are you going to recycle this?
Thanks. We'll support you all the way on The DEATH of #IranDeal @dcexaminer
Thank you! Praying for you all! Unraveling this dangerous deal is going to take time and patience. If anyone can do it you can
.@SenTomCotton is an #ARembarrassment. He thinks he has a shot at POTUS in 2020. Not a snowball's chance in hell. @dcexaminer
Exactly! @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence #StopIranDeal ! Ignore @SenBobCorkersurrender! @dcexaminer @marklevinshow @CRTV @CR
