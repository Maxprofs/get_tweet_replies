SAME TO YOU SIR,
Thank you for your service & standing with our POTUS !
I agree with you, Senator, and thank YOU 4 your service. Please show you respect ALL Americans -including Veterans- by voting #NoTrumpcare
This is a patriot:
Trader
Let Arkies enjoy freedom by providing healthcare. No health no freedom. Bigger threat than ISIS. Gov. role is to protect Including health.
It's hard to celebrate when the discussion is the harm of Trumpcare and especially to Vets! When is your town hall?

The president is not under investigåation for colluding with them the Russia.  How many time do you need to hear it.
Yes he is, stop watching fake news.
Your words mean nothing. You support a crime family that colluded with Russia so we know which side you're on, and it's not the US. Traitor!
Vote no on slaughtering our horses and no on the trumpcare.
Happy 4th of July! #july4th2017 #HappyBirthdayAmerica #thankasoldier
As we celebrate 241 yrs. of this great experiment, we pray our cherished democracy withstands most ignorant & corrupt POTUS in US history.
Then save our health care!

YOU are running for POTUS? As Senator you tell us NOTHING Chk out other Senator pages, see how its done. Its called, informing! U R Useless!
Tehran Tom Your hypocrisy is showing. As you have shown a willingness to take away healthcare from millions of people.
What's happy about it? Our President is a traitor, Republicans don't care and have forgotten our Founding Fathers believed in Senate debate!
@SenTomCotton where is your vote on the REPEAL of Obamacare?
Apply freedom to America'South wild horses. Stop the BLM sale and slaughter.

Thank you for your service.
Palestinians would like an Independence Day too. Can you help to make it happen?

We are no longer independent.  Your @POTUS has sold this nation out to the Russians.
Thank you for standing up for America, Senator Cotton.
Senator Tom Cotton thank you for your service to America,  keep up the Great Work.
Save our healthcare. Don't repeal/replace Obamacare! Don't support giving away Arkansans voting information.
Thank you senator. Can you do something about the scam called H1B visas? It is killing the American IT workers.
I hope you go back to D.C. and fix the health care bill so that it is fair and equitable for all American families
Please encourage the party to get behind the President. I am sick of them standing in the stream between the Parties. We have the majority??
Impeach Cotton
What about the independence of people with disabilities! Ain't no power like the power of Adapt 'cause the power of Adapt don't stop!
The same to you! Thanks for all you do to make this country great (once again). #MAGA #4thofJuly #ProudAmerican
Go back to work tomorrow like the rest of us!

#WeThePeople deserve a representative of the people and for the people. 17% support #Trumpcare. FOUNDERS wouldn't agree w/ your approach.
And happy Fourth of July to you as well.
