I really was impressed with you when I watched you at the hearing on Tv. We want Obama Care Gone! We are broke over it!
If Deathcare goes through, 22 million will be without and the premiums will be higher than they are now. Data proves it. Read.
My spouse is transplant patient. Our out of pocket was over $10k this year. It was $250 BEFORE ObamaCare! So REPEAL IT!
It will never be $250 again. Doesn't matter what is done. I paid $6k with a $3k deductible before Obamacare. Made $11 an hour. Try that.
A person can only hope that the days that BC/BS had $250 Deds come back! That is my wish for us all. OCare is a No 4 me
I'm happy with your decision, glad you are working to make  America great. I back you and back President Trump. Many behind you & POTUS.
Sen. Cotton please oppose McConnell's desire to keep Obamacare core provisions he's offering kickbacks & carveouts t bail out ins.Companies
Agree. I have to wonder where the cost is coming from. I am 71,42yrs with L.A. Co. retired, ready to help if I can. We can't feed everyone..
#Trumpcare is junk and will kill. Don't be a follower or let Trump  bully you. This should have both party's contribution. Please vote no.
Starting to think that repeal of ACA might be the fastest way to get rid of you. It may take Trump Supporters dying to wake the living.
Trump is going to cost you your career, we need Health insurance,  more people are figuring that out everyday
Fix tha ACA and do the right thing for once in your GOP life not follow along and kiss the ring
As a disabled woman, I implore you to vote no on the AHCA as it will make me immobile due to not having healthcare. #noonAHCA #pleasevoteno
Remember when you tried to prove Sessions innocence in open hearing? How's that looking now? Don't make the same mistake with Manafort & Jr
This joker is Sessions Junior.
We voted you spineless worms in for repeal NO REPLACE!
Nothing less than #FullRepeal #RootAndBranch.
Politicians need to get OVER themselves and get OUT of health care. #FullRepeal #FreeMarketSolutions #UnitedForFreedom
It is time to stop this NONSENSE! #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom We demand our liberty be returned!

##REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! !
Health Insurance is not a RIGHT and the Senate cannot grant it as such.
Stop imposing PRODUCTS on the PEOPLE!  #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
How are you going to vote this week ?
Reality...MORE expensive...!
Do you want to lose a promising career to support a raving lunatic
Senator, please vote your conscience this week. ACA repeal would hurt so many.

#arpx #arleg Arkansans disapprove of ‘repeal now, replace later’ approach to healthcare reform http://ow.ly/WFKk30dQmjX  
Please work with the Democrats on health care reform. Is what the citizens deserve this time-a bipartisan solution.
Please do not vote for ACA repeal today.
You actively participated in drafting the horrible deathcare bill. Do you have no conscience? Is it Koch influence or the traitor president?
You're up for re-election soon. You will NOT get my vote & I will actively campaign against you. You are part of the Swamp.
Listen to @AsaHutchinson. He knows Arkansas and you're voting against our best interests on that disastrous healthcare plan.
You guys keep going. Failing is not an option. If it gets done w tax breaks this could b best presidency & Congress of all time.
Please don't mess up my order when I come through the drive-thru.
House n proposed senate bill is an attack on American, shows little concern for life. Your Yes Vote display how you feel abt constituents.
Bet the arrests that took place at your offic on Wednesday weren't mentioned.
Any comments on this evenings WaPo article regarding intercepts of Kislyak reporting to Moscow about Sessions and Trump campaign, Senator?
Considering your despicable grandstanding during Mr. Sessions' testimony, I think we all deserve your thoughts on this development.
The American people would like to be assured that their elected officials will stand up when needed, and not be a partisan enabler...
...especially when it continues to look like we have an illegally elected POTUS who conspired with a foreign enemy.
Or maybe this is all just an Ian Fleming novel? Maybe Dan Silva?
Or maybe you should take this whole matter a little more seriously, since we are paying your salary.

The same health care as federal employees have and the same as you have and bill the liberals the cost !!!! What really sucks vets get  0
Your line of questioning at the Sessions hearing could make for a heck of a campaign commercial for your opponent
Let's hear that squeal
Sorry you lost your chance to take insurance from 22 million people and kill 40,000 per year.  Better luck next year.
Did u talk abt the cadillac health coverage you get on our dime or the shitty coverage you plan for us?
Did you mention that the GOP shot Obamacare in the head & tried to make it look like a suicide?
The unbearable white privilege of Cotton
You have no credibility and we can see who you represent - it's not Arkansans or Americans!  When is that town hall?
.@SenTomCotton @RobyBrock @TBArkansas I don't understand how you can lie so blatantly, Senator Cotton. You don't seem to even care.
