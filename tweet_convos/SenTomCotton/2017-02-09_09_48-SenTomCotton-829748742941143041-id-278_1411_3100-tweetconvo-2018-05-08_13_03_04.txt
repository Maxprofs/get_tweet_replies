@AnnaHern77 @ArkansasOnline that is an excellent idea America needs a raise!
You need to cut that number in half. Millions of Americans need those jobs! Remember, America First!  #AmericaFirst #MAGA
@IdentityEvropa @ArkansasOnline America is not a bottomless cup and we have our own welfare to consider our own problems
a crippled economy and educational system a weakened workforce and moral how can we help
39% scientists immigrant, 57% Anesthesiologist are immigrant they are taking jobs but keep economy moving....................
we have medical schools in America
but don't have enough doctors............
Thank you 
We are expecting great things from you Senator Cotton, Sir! You shine among your peers!
Time 2 create safe zones & get these refugee's out of America.. many Have already gone in2 Canada
I am wondering if they have any rite 2 return 2 USA? If so we need 2 change that...
Now we need to make Sharia Law is not allowed in the USA.
@RNcat50 @ArkansasOnline Keep slashing! We have too many people coming in & taking jobs that American citizens should have! 
Don't forget to IMPEACH some 9th circuit judges.
Good idea! @SenTomCotton Repealing the Hart-Celler act would be great. Please include a 5 year halt to all immigration. @hectormorenco
Sad that somebody didn't introduce this bill before your line of hillbillies came ashore, Tom.
This is not what the majority of Americans want.
@LyndaG1963 @ArkansasOnline    Sounds like common sense to me. Keep up the good work.
ZERO for the next decade just MIGHT get our budget back in balance. Don't you think?  WE DO!!
push it hard!!! The American people could use the relief. I'll contact my senators (IN) to support
Thank you!
Great Job Senator.. God Bless You..
@hectormorenco @ArkansasOnline Go Tom Go
One million a year is a lot.
It's too much. Stop for a decade, see how much better the USA becomes!
The United States should ban 'all'  Immigration for many years to come. We've been overrun. Chaos!
More immigrants! - "Everybody could stand 100 chest x-rays a year"-Repo Man
Give us a five-year moratorium on all immigration first.
I say a decade. Will get our own education system and population back to basics.
Thank you Senator Cotton! Regarding your immigration bill...
@kachninja @ArkansasOnline immigration needs to be lowered drastically.
What about the 'anchor' baby problem that we have?
@hectormorenco @ArkansasOnline This is never talked abt When r we going 2put halt 2immigration Quotas Worked! 2 many Ppl Here
@hectormorenco @ArkansasOnline Cap it at zero.
I hope, Senator, you are going to severly limit use of American Job Killing  H 1-B Visas?
@hectormorenco @ArkansasOnline do it.
Senator. Please quit. You are a traitor. You should be on trial for treason. Escape while you can
Thank you Senator Cotton. Not do a bill to stop anchor babies. We have way too many to support.
Cotton! PASS THAT BILL! So Black Robes won't Matter!
@Eyes_of_justice @ArkansasOnline thank you Senator cotton the political will of the people is on your side.Stop this madness.
@Lagartija_Nix @ArkansasOnline Go Tom, go! It's about time. America/Americans FIRST. 
@DesignerDeb3 @ArkansasOnline why r u doing this? Are u paying? Ensuring our safety?
Just support Trump would be grand.
HURRY!!!
Yes!
@tomesimpson @ArkansasOnline thank you for caring about us and the future of America#CottonBill
go Razorbacks!
Cotton in 2024
How about we don't take anyone else we have to pay for until this natl debt is paid. How about that.
How about no cap! We don't want those people in our country who is and was brought up to hate us! Protect @ArkansasOnline
good proposal, but American citizens not been able to bring their spouse & kids is ridiculous.
@mikewright1997 @ArkansasOnline
AGAIN DO IT STOP THE TALKING AND DO IT @GOP @POTUS #MAGA @DCoreno @mglessman @AnnCoulter @vdare
@mikewright1997 @ArkansasOnline Good
Do it  You have our full support.
Sir where did ur relatives come from? Are you Native American? Who's going to work those Chicken Farms in AR?
just a few more terrible years we have to listen to you.
What a novel idea- A limit on how much of the world we let in. @newtgingrich @RudyGiuliani @Reince
AWESOME!!!! THANK YOU MR. SENATOR!!!!!!
Well done Tom. Keep working. #ask @Malcolm Turnbull what #Australias %  Omni immigration N2-Low per land mass?
Borders #realThing obligation attached - #Duty to the public Legal picnic of imbecility @COSProject
2 write clear border protection includes immigration -
Absolutely Senator, exactly what needs to be accomplished...
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline go get them Tom we're behind you
Confirmed spkrs at Unite IE Conserv Conf: Prager, Elder, Hewitt and Joel Pollak
should come to Unite IE Conserv Conf in CA, 4/30.  Tell us about #immigration & @POTUS 1st 100 days
Greg@RedlandsTeaParty.net
Great idea, but no good laws can pass Senate especially #immigration laws unless you eliminate filibuster
@Koxinga8 @ArkansasOnline ...badly needed ...@realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @FortuneMagazine @WSJ @FoxNews @CNN @nytimes
Are you proud of this? Where are your people from?  And are they turning in their graves? #47Traitors
@tod1776 @ArkansasOnline Excellent idea! We have the right 2say who/how many immigrants come n the country.Times have changed
Tell McConnell to bring down the votes to simple majority and for SCOTUS too.. too much BS i/Senate
God Speed, 50 years over do!
I definitely agree.
thank you!
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Good idea, Senator...Start it after a full 50 year moratorium on all immigration
@gatewaypundit @ArkansasOnline  Sir, the faster the better 
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline 
Why can't each protester show some and take in at least one refugee family! They can't go back.
Politics aside, we all know that their home r n concrete shambles. Kids saw own families killed.
They're n shock. They can't go back. How will you extremely vet a child?  Surely Americans have.
We can do extreme vetting & still b who we r as a nation. Turning orphans away is not who we are.
With all due respect.
As someone who has been to Afghanistan, he knows what damage terrorists can do.
It's about time.
Great! A Visa Moratorium would be even better.
Thank You Sen Tom Cotton, about time someone steps up.
@1stAmendAlive @ArkansasOnline Save America! Save the Western World as we know it.
@AnnCoulter repeal Javits 1965 Immigration Act which allows anyone to come to us, instead of people that benefit us!
@dixiefortrump @ArkansasOnline I pray this becomes law quickly!
YES! yes!! Thank you for protecting Americans!!
Get it passed!
Go Tom!!!
We will vote and we will not forget your betrayal of hard working immigrants in our Arkansas and USA...
God bless you Sen. Cotton.  You are an answer to our prayers.. Thank you for fighting for us. God bless you
@newgypsydreams @ArkansasOnline How about a bill restricting the courts jurisdiction on immigration matters?
Slash more.
perfect. Do it tomorrow.  :)
@smartvalueblog @ArkansasOnline the left started this and they are not going to like how it ends

Senator Cotton, you should just repeal the '65 Hart-Cellar act and reinstate the National Origins Act of 1924
Please. We must have boundaries!  @AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline
You are fighting for the safety of everyone in this CountryThank You and God Bless you
I would like to see it halted altogether. Take care of Americans first. Reassess a few years from now
If it passes I hope you're & your family is the first ones on the list.
As soon as possible- judges are not the President
@AnnCoulter thank god someone gets it
@gatewaypundit @ArkansasOnline Hopefully slash it by half. He will have Graham and McCain to fight.
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline awesome. Pass this bill NOW
DO IT!!! PLEASE DO IT!!!
@rlplus2 @DLPaxt Arkansas is fortunate to have @SenTomCotton!!
Yes we are! He's a true patriot!!
WELL DONE TOM 
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline  You should also pass legislation denying lower court jurisdiction over alien travel to US issues.
@gatewaypundit @ArkansasOnline another screwball falling for Trump's alternative facts or scary tactics or his dubious ways!!
Great job Tom. Let's get this done. McCain will fight - but you are stronger.
@gatewaypundit @ArkansasOnline Thank you
Need a policy like AUSTRALIA. Just bring in people WE need.
Interesting strategy for a Senator. Do something people want, get them to like you, and then get re-elected.
Thank God, we are sadly becoming the minority here, feeling hatred in our own homeland!!
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Way to go. Please don't forget about H1B recipients who already took our jobs!
Slashing immigration in half is still about 50% too low. 
We need a lengthy pause on all immigration.
Another Cotton total mistake!!!  Doesn't represent Arkansas
@Darren32895836 @ArkansasOnline Refugees shouldn't be taken care of with taxpayer money, just charity funds No argue' 
Over $$
Shouldn't we cut  illegal alien DACA, y still active? LEGAL  immig family unif reqs 5yr sponsorship - why not extend 4 life?
Thank you...we the people stand with you on less legal immigration,work visas, and less Refugees...deporting
How bout STOP, Halt,  DENY???
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline  CUT FUNDING TO THE SANCTUARY CITIES!! Millions everyday !!  PUT AMERICANS FIRST !!
This should b a formula with full US employment determining the #immigration nums and not the hokey economist nums
If not for the cheap bastards who refuse to pay fair wages to REAL Americans, immigration is useless.
Aren't we diverse enough ? We allow Dem's to stay here. Waiting for Muslim cities in US to rise up & kill us.
We ALLOW Dems to stay here? Wow!
PLEASE!!!! This is LONG overdue!
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Agree with you Tom just remember we want to be welcoming Country of All people with MUTUAL RESPECT
we need a bill to stop anchor babies like @KenPaxtonTX !! @AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline
I love immigration, however its out of hand lately and we need to slow it down
@SeawordG @ArkansasOnline THANK YOU Senator Cotton!!!!
The fight for America's survival begins.
@Darren32895836 @ArkansasOnline amen senator it's about time !!!!
@Darren32895836 @ArkansasOnline Understandable, but regrettable, especially for South African economic depressed minorities
I thought 500k was too much but its a step in the right direction. We are not the worlds tit!
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline congratulations America,  Canada is gonna be a problem
Hey Tom with the Abe look (you wish) what about ACA. From Searcy
Big surprise to find the Jr Sen conspiring with Steve Bannon, self-avowed Neo-Nazi, on this economic disaster.
Bit you are running hard for 2020 aren't you
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Good!!
This is a great Senator 
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline About time America the Great doesn't need any additional people Must absorb what we have
@HenryOray @ArkansasOnline Sen Cotton a True Patriot
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline 
Dems. Would rather spend money on refugees
and imagrants rather than black people in inner cities
Dems. Know for every dollar spent on imagrants less 
for poor blacks in inner city racist dems.
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline thank you and God bless you
I disagree with you on some things, Senator Cotton, but may God bless you on this task.
this is one over to you Senator Cotton. Good job.
YES
Why do you hate people of color?
Sounds good. BUT. doubt it passes. Would take years to implement too, I bet
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Now that's what I consider good immigration reform.
@AnnCoulter It would be great to see legis that would cut ALL funds/prog and benefits to illegals for reallocation to vets,etc
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline ...sounds great, Now let's get it passed!
love it!  We can't afford to continue bring the third world to our shores.
Immigration, World Poverty and Gumballs
Beautiful.
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline pass it!!!!!
Just get the bill passed.  We are tired on the delays & political stalling.  We don't pay u 2 play games
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline  Too many.  One is plenty and vet him/her for 2 years
Get 'er done, Chief.
Thank you Senator. Stop it and move on to repatriation next.
@realDonaldTRump NO MORE IMMIGRANTS legal or illegal until ALL illegals are deported&US debt paid
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline close the open window to undocumented (that means illegal) immigrants until control is in place.
@realDOnaldTrump @potus How about NO refugee's NO immigrants till US $300+Trillion debt paid?
Thank God! Thank you!
@IdentityEvropa @ArkansasOnline Excellent!
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline what happened to existing immigration LAW we have? Do we just ignore it? Enforce and limit!
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline in the meantime, the open border ppl can provide housing, med. care, food, etc. to their illegals.
Great news. There is NO real advantages of 3rd world immigration to western nations. Needs to be stopped 100%
Great news.
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline excellent idea!!! We can't even support people who are American!!
GOD bless you Tom. I am praying you succeed.
In the 1800's, immigrants came to America to be Americans.
Now- they come just to live & work in America
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Update/change your license, privide birth certificate. Immigrants 
we can't be mean..........
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Please!
@JBaker31826004 @ArkansasOnline yes,let's please slash to ZERO!
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline Need to be careful on slashing immigration cap-from Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
@AnnCoulter @ArkansasOnline good this is the most important thing they can do for American workers it's about time!
Love this guy, great job, GOP help him do this.
I am very supportive of this! Pretty soon they will  outnumber citizens! From your neighbor in Oklahoma!
