You are one of the white hats in the USA - we need 100 more of you!  Thank you Sir for your patriotism and honesty.  God Bless!
That's great Tom but what about Russia? It's not a spy novel or joke 2 Americans who want to keep their democracy @CNN @jaketapper@foxnews
The #DeepState fabricated this story. It's preposterous and quickly getting old.
Ah the "deep state"; listen to Alex Jones and Hannity much? For God sakes; read a book, go outside and play. United States of Stupidity
This trolling stuff is fun!!!
You and Trump have so much in common ... just love to hear yourself squawk on and on.
I THINK WE HAVE ALL HEARD ENOUGH OF YOU.
Please help Trump weed our the anti Americans in Congress so they can be removed. We are blessed to have people like you on our side!
You didn't do a damn thing for your country today at #SessionsHearing . Americans see you as a TRAITOR. Remove @SenTomCotton. Unqualified
Mr Cotton  a pleasure to see how you work!!
!!  thank you!!!  
Why did the leader not hold Sessions in contempt of Congress for avoiding to respond to questions?
Russia loves you tommy boy!
Thank you Senator Cotton you give us Hope!
Nope. He's a sack of poopy.
Just saying for the umpteeth time that DT is completely wrong about Iran. Our enemy is KSA - the people DT was dancing with. Deal with it.
You ROCK Sen. Cotton! Working for American people! Cutting the DC DEM Drama Theater down to size! Now Iran smack-down!
= #PutinBot @SenTomCotton
Thank You for standing for the truth at the hearing. Americans were very proud, Need more on both sides to man up for this BS to stop
U R an EMBARRASSING for our country
Thank u 4 bringin Clarity 2 this kangaroo court 4 AG Sessions Congress needs 2 get back 2 work 4 the ppl instead of playin political theater
Russia was proud of you today sir!
You are becoming one of my favorite republicans.  Thanks for serving us!
And my family is from Arkansas!
Didn't know you before.  Really impressed because of investigation.  Great questions.  Will be watching!
Oh let me watch and see what movie you reference.
You sound like s traitor, look like a junkie, and act like a fool. A little integrity would go a long one, but party over could try is you..
Sir - you truly give us hope for our elected politicians. 
God bless you.
Keep fighting for America & the people
Thank you Senator Cotton for standing for truth and justice. I hope you also support our President. Very disturbing what's going on.
Did you support Saudi Wahhabi Terrorists 350M sale? This include White Phosphorus & Depleted Uranium Weapons? @GreenPartyUS
Will USA be also supplying Wahhabi Saudi Terrorists with American made cluster bombs?
Saudi Arabia-led coalition has used UK-manufactured cluster bombs in Yemen - new evidence https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/saudi-arabia-led-coalition-has-used-uk-manufactured-cluster-bombs-yemen-new-evidence â€¦ 
You were amazing today thank you for standing tall for all Americans. Jeff Sessions is an honorable honest man and deserves that destination
Anybody that believes in Jesus these days shouldn't be allowed to vote.
You're really out of touch with the public sir.
Thank you for speaking the Truth!
BRAVO!!!

Great presentation of the absolute, pertinent and obvious need for those and more. Thank you very much Senator Cotton 4 the correct ?'s 2day
I am amazed at how you continually find lower standards for yourself to fail at, and why am I still so disappointed in you?
Spy novels?  Truth is stranger than fiction.
Did AIPAC put a device in your ear to dictate their talking points directly or did you memorize them?
Continuing to do Israel's bidding
You' are a madman sir!  A big hug and many many thanks, love America!!
Your use of twitter is outstanding.....well done
Thank you for showing how ridiculous this has all become! Finally a voice of reason in this, as Sessions said, "through the looking glass "
Thinking that the Russian invasion is SPY FICTION MAKES YOU A STAIN ON OUR CONSTITUTION. SECURITY AGENCIES HAVE CONFIRMED IT. U DONT BELONG
The Russians aren't invading. You should be more concerned about ISIS.
Great job today! I just hope you stand by trump & do what the American people elected all u republicans to do!!
Kudos to you sir. It's nice to have someone outside the swamp represent thus country. Love Arkansas come up there to Mt Home & trout fish
you also spoke like a moron when supposedly 'questioning' ag sessions. james bond & jason bourne? you guys shouldn't imbibe so early

Great job today Mr Cotton.

You sit there and joke abt it, we the ppl have the right to get straight answers the truth which the rep party seems to forget you work 4 us
You'll never get "straight" answers for a fabricated story. If there were evidence to this fabrication, it would have been leaked by now.
After your special little dinner with Trump the other night, we can see you are doing his bidding and complicit in the #trumprussia cover-up
What about Russian sanctions ? Forget  it . POTUS  would be mad at u and ur a little meek for that.
You have my respect for showing common sense which is very uncommon. Ty
You did good
Hard to watch when we're all laughing at you.
Was this before or after your pointless love fest towards Sessions?
He was just pointing out the stupid conspiracy theory by the left.
#pizzagate is a conspiracy. You don't investigate conspiracies for months.
Time to open an investigation into  L. Lynch, and the lies, cover-up and Comey's participation in it and leaked documents.

You suck at your job.
So Session is really concerned about RU attacking our electrical grids n such yet also feels we should have a relationship with RU?
Bullshit
Quickly becoming my favorite Senator. We need more people like you watching our 6. Keep it up good sir.
great job today!!  America needs more Senators just like you 
Yes and then played your best  #TrumpGroupie at Intel hearing  #sigh #jeffsessionshearing
And you are no better than a slug protecting a traitorous president
Yes!!! Senator Tom Cotton for POTUS 2024!
Thank you for that Tom, but thank you VERY much for your time in Sessions hearing. You made us proud in Arkansas.
Good
We all saw you with sessions. You should really be embarrassed for yourself.
Democrats should be embarrassed. He spoke the Truth, how much longer is this crap going to continue?
Keep telling yourself that. Trump will be behind bars.
11 months FBI investigation, 6 months senate investigation, not one shred of evidence. You might want to stock up on that tissue snowflake.
Like an investigation this size is going to be quick. How do you know theres no evidence? They aren't going to lay it out there yet.
Tim cotton 
We love Senator Tom Cotton! Thank you for bringing a dose of reality to the PC culture vulture liberals during the #SessionsHearing !!!
ohhhhh you're from Arkansas.... explains so much now
Nice  Job
