I honestly can't think of one thing that is more anti-American than placing more value to one life, over another's.
Cotton is straight up mean spirited.
He also blocked an Obama Ambassador nominee out of pure spite. Tom blocked her and she died waiting, 820 days after her nomination.

It's sickening. People like Cotton don't deserve to have public service positions. Kids either for that matter. The Universe will give him
exactly what the deserves.
Thank You Senator! Please close any loopholes for merit based immigration as Indians are gaming the system with fake paperwork.
Really? You're President wants to hire them. He lied, again.
You're racist AF.
Now if only you and Perdue could do something about McCain, Graham, Sasse and Flake who will try to block your bill.
Because AMERICANS WILL NOT DO MIGRANT WORK, OR AGRICULTURE. What part of that do you not understand???
Why don't you just establish some kind of racial hierarchy? You know that's what you want!
Actually, it would make it HARDER for skilled and educated AMERICANS to get those skilled jobs, senator! Think about it!
Curbing Legal Immigrants is ok but atleast make it fair for Existing Immigrants who r waiting with approved I-140 in EB-2 n EB-3 category.
Not true Sanfransisco population is roughly 800K greencard capped at 480K and among them low skill num is even lower
Worst stab at justifying a horrible policy that I have every heard in my life!
Lacking intelligence
If stand you on "America First", how is flooding high paying jobs immigrants support that principle? Only letting in foreign elites?
Who were you visiting in LA instead of meeting the people of AR? You still support Bibi? You won't be re-elected and you won't be president.
...... oh yeah... the undocumented.... big biz exploits.....
Xenophobic racist
demographics reveal that there is a severe shortage of skilled, low skilled and professional workers throughout the amerikkkan population.

That you could then pay a lower wage without benefits so that Americans can be janitors. Also without benefits.
Lies lies and more lies
You and I both know better. There are not enough common laborers now to build the darn wall donjon wants. Get real.
To bad we still don't hear from Sen Boozman
No it wouldn't.  Americans 1st
We don't HAVE TO take in 1 person 4 any reason. r times when we haven't. It isn't a right but a gift of real Americans. Raise A seems fair.
So.. who is gonna do the low paying jobs? i.e.: cook,clean,serve etc?????
Thank you for the Act. Any points for immigrants who gained experience in the US in the past, to avoid a brain drain? Like Canada?
Green cards larger than the population of San Francisco?!? #SentenceStructureMatters
i wish it was true

only way to stop immigration to this country is stop supporting corrupt governments around the world Stop imports from slave wage countries
How about we just abolish the welfare state. And let the immigrants who believe in the same values come emigrate
Many are escaping dictatorships poverty-stricken war torn countries created by years of failed American foreign policies
Won't those best skilled immigrants be taking jobs from best skilled Americans. Oh your just giving big business way to get cheaper labor
Yeah, it makes no sense. We know Melania wouldn't get in.
once a component of the 1924-1965 policy, which served us well.
#PraiseTheRAISE
You've shown who you are. Hateful & discriminatory.  
To say nothing of the fact that it's actually harmful to many industries. #FUTC
Please. Tell the truth Tom. You don't believe this. Just more anti immigrant rhetoric. Shame on you.
RAISE:
The minimum wage
Taxes on corporations
Taxpayer funded education to include college
The number of people with health care

Priorities
Simple economics: raising the minimum wage means more incentives for foreigners. Increases in taxes means businesses will open shop outside
If you really had an interest in a living wage you would support raising the minimum wage instead of more tax breaks for the super wealthy.
#RAISISM
This is a throw back to the mean spirited 1920s. We grew up as a nation and accepted all. You need to grow up.
We demand a moratorium on immigration and refugee resettlement until nat'l poverty and unemployment rates are down to one percent.
Hard to trust republicans when when they lied 7 years republicans
Large Health insurer Molina has already filed class action lawsuits against GOP for not keeping its promise except others to follow
Govt get out of Healthcare totally!
Free market rules best in capitalism in democracy! This ain't socialism people!
If you cared about American WAGES you'd raise the MINIMUM WAGE. There is NOTHING good that will come out of this, NOTHING.
@GOP wants you to work ork until you die with no Healthcare coverage @realDonaldTrump said he wants to eliminate minimum wage

Senator Cotton,  we need to Repeal and Replace the corrupt, failed taxpayer abusive refugee resettlement program. ENOUGH!!

Architects, refugees team up on tiny houses in Berlin https://youtu.be/Um385cjos1c 

Our government should help all Americans welcome refugees with open arms. https://twitter.com/Free_Media_Hub/status/894284218838249473 …



Thank you for your hard work Mr.Tom Cotton.
