So prove you supposedly care. Enact stricter gun laws, not abolish them, but outlaw military weapons to prevent massacres like this.
Your empty #ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough compared to the $1.9+MILLION you took from NRA. Blood is on your hands #SendBackTheBloodMoney
America needs leaders, @SenTomCotton. Offering thoughts and prayers is perverse when you haul in $1,968,714.00 from the NRA.

#GOPComplicit

U sleep with them NRA in the amount of almost 2 million $
Easy to see where you’re loyalty is..so stop the FAKE sympathy 
How's that blood money weighing on your soul?
praying for the victims and for YOU @SenTomCotton  from The Great Passion Play
We don't need more of your prayers, @SenTomCotton. We need you to send back the NRA's blood money, and pass #GunControlNow
Every elected official who's received even a penny of NRA money should donate the equivalent to shooting victims.
Well heck, let's double that.
Do something. Or we will make sure you get voted out.
Tom us from Arkansas.  We love guns here
Your thoughts and prayers won’t bring back peoples murdered loved ones. Pay the NRA back their blood money and STAND FOR SOMETHING you fool.

TAKE THE GUNS AWAY OR HAVE BETTER CONTROL. WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS THIS. ENGLAND HAD IT HAPPEN 4 TIMES IN 15 YEARS. ADD OUR NUBRS
And how much money do you get from the NRA? Isn't over $1 M? 4 shame; their blood is on your hands & others like you who take $ from the NRA
DO something! Ban assault weapons. Mandate background checks. Limit magazine size.  Prayers don't bring back the dead. Take action.
how's that blood money from @NRA treating you, tommy?  save your prayers, they have no value, and are worthless here!
Tom cotton how do you live with yourself, the GOP keep rollback back gun laws, letting mentally ill people easier access to guns...disgrace
taking another vote to rollback more gun laws, pathetic just for money what use is an auto rifle for? now, there for hunting human-beings
Thoughts and prayers don't solve the gun problem. Stop taking money from the NRA.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
If feel the same but Please use your “thoughts and prayers” to write a gun control bill to stop this terrorism from happening. No semi-autos
Break-action, also known as Broke back. Cmon G, you know they won’t ever take #2 away from you.
I don’t know what any of this means.
You’re*. Thanks :)
Oh thanks for correcting me I forgot y’all are elites. I’m so happy you corrected my typo on Twitter I already feel smarter
Stop taking NRA blood money and do something about it
then send back ur 2 million dollars in NRA blood money.
Stop shilling for the NRA.
Deeply saddened? #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Just like @JohnBoozman, you don't have the stones to protect Americans. You too will do what you're told and pass NRAs silencer bill. #shame
Send the money back to the NRA and then you can speak. Till then....
When you took the NRAs money to fight against #guncontrol you decided these 58 dead people were a price worth paying to keep your seat.
What else you got bruh?!
.@SenTomCotton
It's on you #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You've taken money from the #NRA. The blood of Las Vegas --- and thousands of others --- is on YOUR hands. Good luck explaining that to God.
You're not going to do anything to prevent this from happening again, though, right? NRA contributions preclude that possibility.
Planning on doing anything besides thinking and praying?  Yeah, I didn't think so.
Are u sad enough finally to take action & enact COMMON SENSE gun control? 

It’s a rhetorical question. We all know u aren’t. U R COMPLICIT
I don't believe you. The US has done nothing & will do nothing, so this will keep happening. I stand by my shock, heartache, and sarcasm.
Enough Thoughts & Prayers. They do not work. Get off your ass and do something to save the lives of US citizens.
Isaiah 1:15. Your actions belie your words.
When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; When ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.

Thoughts and prayers won't bring back the dead. But how do you vote? That could make a difference.

I am a veteran and carry a gun.
Combat weapons in the street = dead people in the street. Have the guts to fight NRA
$1.9 million = how much you've gotten from the @NRA ... F your thoughts & prayers
The term "thought & prayers" has been overused by people who neither think nor pray.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are an accomplice, Senator.
Because I only have twp..

Your "thoughts and prayers" do not bring back dead people.
Plan on doing anything to prevent the 30K+ Americans that die every year to #gunviolence or just offer more prayers the next time it happens
blood is on your hands
Stop insulting our intelligence. We don't want your "thoughts and prayers" we want action. Ban assault weapons or shut up. Talk is cheap.
we remember when u authored the letter to the Ayatollah undermining the president. Now u support Traitor Trump sold out to russia.
You took $1,968,714 from @NRA. Your #thoughtsandprayers are shit when you won't act to prevent gun violence

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
$1,968,714 enough said.
Perhaps you should send the NRA their money back so you wouldn’t be at their beck and call
You are complicit in this. You have blood on your hands. You are a murderer @SenTomCotton #boughtandpaidforbytheNRA
In other words, you'll do nothing. You won't help. you won't even begin a debate on gun control, but you'll take NRA money.
Send back all the money you received from the NRA. No one gives a crap about your thoughts and prayers when you are in the pocket of the NRA
Empty words from someone that takes payments to not do anything about a known problem in America
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You

Don't

Care.
Bullshit. Send back your blood money from the NRA and maybe I'll take this with a grain of salt.
Saddened enough to give back the bribe from @NRA ??? Didn't think so ... #disgusting
senator, your thoughts and prayers AR Pleasant, but true action is background checks and Tighter regulation. Do your job!
Shame on you and your blood stained donations!
You .
Don't you get tired of offering t's and p's for gun massacres in America? Is that enough, just never-ending t's and p's?
Exactly how sad do you need to get before you change the gun laws? How bad does it need to get before you act? #boughtandpaidbyNRA
Keep your sorry thoughts and prayers.  How about taking action on sensible gun control laws that will lessen incidents like this one?
Gun--jock logic -- If everybody at the show had been armed, they could have returned fire!
Yeah, only in the movies.
Hypocrite

Put your money where your mouth is: denounce the NRA.
Does this mean you'll be sending back the generous contributions made to you by the @NRA? #ThoughtsandPrayers


Prayers are not enough. "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." (James 2:26) CHANGE THE GUN LAWS.
Prove that it doesn't.
You're very negative. Please unfollow me.
Cotton will still keep fighting against gun control and more people will die and more empty condolences will follow.
A lot of good your thoughts and prayers do http://them.How  about some hard-core gun regulation?
GUN CONTROL

Those dead and injured on on your hands Tommy boy.  You're stained forever for taking $1MM+ from the @NRA
Fuck your prayers. NRA has given you almost 2 million dollars. You're bought and paid for.
DO SOMETHING! Enough thoughts and prayers. Gun control NOW!
Just another angry old white male with a high-powered assault  rifle.

Spare us your crocodile tears until you do something about that. @NRA
As a Christian, as a prayer warrior, you need to back those prayers up with action, comprehensive gun control, or this tweet is pointless.
$1,968,714 does that number sound familiar tom? It's the amount of money you've accepted from the nra.
Thoughts and prayers?  So all you have is lip service over and over?  Grow a spine
That $1.9M in NRA contributions sure buys a lot of thoughts and prayers Tom!
Maybe you can donate the $2M you got from the NRA to the families of the victims instead of sending them worthless thoughts and prayers.
You're a veteran. You know what a bullet can do to the human skull, but hey thanks for the prayers.
You have received $1,968,714 from @NRA. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

Time for you to do something beside just praying. We need meaningful regulation of guns. #Enough.
If only you were in a position to do something, and protect further victims.
You have blood on your hands mister #LasVegasShootings #NRAKills #nomoreguns
Why would you think your thoughts and prayers are worth anything?  They're empty and worthless.
Then do something about it.
Here's an idea: ban massive assault weapons.
$2m! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Thoughts and prayers are useless .  Take your head out of the sand. Vote for #GunContolNow #BanAssaultWeapons
You & the rest of @GOP are nothing but prostitutes for the @NRA.
Stop taking NRA money and vote against silencers for all. That would be a start.
You took over 1 mil from @NRA
Which of your kids would have todie to make you regret lax gun laws?
Asking for my dead daughter
#GunSense
By all means pray.  Meanwhile, we are praying you will support sensible gun laws, ban fully auto assault weapons, and stop taking NRA $$.
Tom Cotton: bought by the NRA
DO SOMETHING, COWARD.  Thoughts & prayers do nothing to help anyone.  Your support of the NRA is insane and partly responsible.
You gonna donate the NRA $ you received last election to victims?
Y'all have backed yourselves into a corner, huh? Appealing to racists and taking NRA blood money have left you impotent and guilty.
Interesting. 3 hours since this tweet and nothing since. From YOU, the silence is deafening. Is the 2020 campaign on hold for the day?
For the very first time in recent memory, you were not the uppermost tweet on my opening screen.
Then do something about it! Call out the NRA! Tighten gun laws. Ban assault rifles. Stop acting helpless and DO something!
Give back the NRA money that you take that keeps you from renewing the assault weapons ban.  Vote against silencers for assault weapons.
That's about all you're good for.  Maybe that's how you should legislate.  Don't actually do anything - just sit there and think and pray.
No one cares about your useless '"thoughts and prayers." They care about the blood that Congress has on its hands.
Thoughts & prayers are good, but victims would rather be alive. Pass sensible gun control. Complicit NRA puppet. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You’re a useless Tom Green-wannabe that’s enabled shooters everywhere. Rhetoric as hollow as your suit. 

Pray for your job. It’ll need it.
Damn Tom you got 2 mil for them dead people! Keep cashin in dem checks
Deeply saddened @SenTomCotton got $1,968,714 from @NRA.
Hypocrite. $1,968,714 from @NRA Your thoughts and prayers are worthle$$ #GOPterrorist
UR a slow learner r'nt you. If thoughts & prayers worked, death count wouldn't go up w every shooting. How about some common sense gun laws?
I bet you cry your tears with the millions of dollars the NRA gave you
I'll send you some soap to wash the blood off of your hands.
So Thomas, how much money did *you* get from the NRA?
Up yours, Tom.
#NRABLOODMONEY
So what will you do about it?  You were elected to fix these problems? What will you do to make things better? Pray for more guns?
Why did you take that money?
You're in a position where you could help prevent further tragedies, yet you refuse. Weep those crocodile tears into your blood money.
Shove your "thoughts and prayers" up your ass. You're bought and paid for by the @NRA and are one of the most corrupt members of the senate.
You're a Senator, not a philosopher or preacher.  We don't need your thoughts and prayers... we need your vote to make us safer. #GunSense
Senator pleas vote yes on share and on reciprocity.
Hypocrite! The blood of those 58 people is on your hands. I hope the millions that you took from the NRA were worth it
Are you saving a few prayers funds from the NRA continue to flow into your coffers?
2MM from NRA. SHAMEFUL. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Enjoyed my morning calming down a bunch of inner city kids with PTSD from gun violence, it was a great day here!! Yay NRA!!!
You were given $1,968,714 to NOT be saddened & to NOT prevent another occurrence. #NRATerrorism
You got nearly 2mil from the NRA. We need stricter gun control to prevent these tragedies but you won't vote for #GunControl b/c
You have blood on your hands. Sleep well. You might as well have pulled the trigger.
Thoughts & prayers don't stop bullets.
$2M from the NRA? Gun violence follows gun ownership - you know this and yet you do nothing but recite "thoughts and prayers" well that won't cut it anymore, be a real hero work with Chris Murphy come to Newtown MAKE A DIFFERENCE and do it now.
Eat shit. You took $2 million from @NRA. You made this. #GOPMadeThis
Where’s your version of the Brady Bill? Get a spine. Prayers are great, but they don’t bring back the dead.
Oh look, Senator Traitor sends thoughts and prayers.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
NRA $$$ — I know @TomCottonAR doesn’t believe in God because this combo is going to send him to hell.
What thoughts specifically?
Send your blood money back, you creep.
Not enough! Sensible gun laws would be much better than any kind of prayers.
Cut, paste, repeat.
Another NRA hypocrite with his empty do nothing later prayers....
If you're so sad DO SOMETHING. You have the ability to end this specific type of event from ever happening again. Do something. Please
Is there a verbage "stamp" GOP senators use for mass murder via guns in the U.S. ?, i.e. "tragic", "senseless", "thoughts", "prayers" ???
If you really want to do something in the victims name, kill the silencer bill.
@SenTomCotton How can you sleep at night? May your dreams be haunted forever.
Yet u took $1,968,714 from @NRA - how’s the bribe workin 4 ya? More important 2 load ur coffers instead of working FOR the ppl #BloodMoney
Keep your thoughts and prayers till you're free from the NRA.
No, it isn’t...you disingenuous man...you get money from the NRA...I don’t believe you

How much money do you get every year from the NRA? Just curious...
Stop taking blood money from the @nra. Until then, you are #complicit
Bet the @NRA loves your #thoughtsandprayers. You are a total #sellout @SenTomCotton. #BanSilencers #GunControlNow
You accepted $1,968,714.00 in blood soaked money from the NRA. You are complicit in every single death by guns in US.
Prayers are worthless. We need sensible gun control.
But the 9,900 the NRA gave you probably made you feel better about selling our families out.
several million reasons why your thoughts and prayers are hollow....and you know everyone of them....
This is useless. Stop acting like there is nothing you can do. You just choose not to do it. Bought & paid for by the NRA.
This didn't have to happen, pass sensible gun laws.
A Tennessee church shooting was stopped last week because someone had a gun and used it against the shooter gu s aren't responsible for this
And the boat load of NRA money I get  https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1727441590620657/ … #GOPcomplicit
Screw your prayers. Pass some laws to protect us! Every other civilized country has. Of course they aren't both go & paid for by the NRA.
Guy wearing pink pussy hut (on his Facebook page)? Looks like he was a member of crazy "resist" group.
You have blood on your hands and your soul. We see you.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are bought and paid for Tom. Guns for everyone but not healthcare, right Tom. Shame on you.

#GunControlNow 
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Thoughts/prayers won’t help if you don’t vote no on the silencer bill.  Hearing those shots warned the people to run.
Save it. You are culpable in this. Just as you are for 9 million children losing heath care.  How *do* you sleep at night?
With the amount of $$$ you take from the NRA your fingerprints are on this along with theirs. #NRAbloodmoney
reduce gun violence - thanks for your consideration
As you pray, what is the Lord directing you to do about guns?  Then have the audacity to  . . . .
Then please return NRA funding and do something to protect your people. Your action matters. Please lead the change.
You have the the unique position to do something here
Your bank account is thinking and praying for more $$ from @NRA
