@SenToomey You're such a patriotic American, Senator, I wouldn't expect you to want to help out in any way for the good of the country.
@WarrenGetchell Wanting to be responsible with finances isn't for the good of the country? @SenToomey
@mattithyahu @SenToomey Yeah, Matt, austerity is working so well in Britain and the rest of Europe right now and that's what he's advocating
@WarrenGetchell Advocating lower spending is always a good thing. @SenToomey
@mattithyahu @SenToomey United States defaulting on debts is NOT a good thing. Based on their past actions, GOP doesn't care about the debt.
@WarrenGetchell That is moronic. Step spending, reduce the debt! @SenToomey
@mattithyahu @SenToomey You seem to be ridiculing me, Matt. Do you see the need to? Can't we talk without casting aspersions?
@WarrenGetchell My apologies. I'm unwilling to take Ds seriously on "responsibility" when they have not passed budget and don't like cuts.
@SenToomey We should be borrowing more! Deficit decline & Pres. Reagan raised ceiling HOW MANY TIMES? Support POTUS & listen to maj.of ppl
@rubymagic We are $16T in debt and you want to borrow more? Stupid idea! @SenToomey
.@SenToomey < #Obstructionists ... non-negotatiors ..  #GOP #FAIL @Senate_GOPs
@HouseBitchTim Non-negotiators? Obama is a petulant child who much ALWAYS get what he wants and NEVER negotiates. @SenToomey @Senate_GOPs
R-PA #USSenate #LIAR mt >>>>>>>@SenToomey Now POTUS wants more tax increases to fund more bloated government spending. Not going to happen.
@suzik How is he a liar? @SenToomey
@SenToomey Country improving too much 4 you Repubs.?Your obstruction tactics won't work to your favor Again! ppl see what the problem is=GOP
.@SenToomey   Do you know how freaking sick Americans are of hearing this crap.  Look at the GOP favorability polls... less than 25%! STOP.
@SenToomey dropping ffilabuster
@SenToomey We are tired of all the bs & excuse making in DC. Put your differences aside and solve problems. For the good of all citizens.
@SenToomey We need some Republican guts starting now
@SenToomey yeah it will he is a fraud and is getting by with it. look at F&F and benghazi nothing. now reid id trying to talk Mc. into
@SenToomey Please stand tough for us. I feel like its difficult to get steeled opinions/support against the proposals that POTUS presents.
@SenToomey Good, please keep fighting it. I worry for my parents constantly.
@SenToomey Mr. Toomey, I sure hope you stand by that statement. POTUS and his mindless followers cannot be left to continue.
@SenToomey Thank you.  Stand firm!
@SenToomey I certainly hope you and the rest of the GOP stand strong and don't bend. We're at a critical juncture in this country
@SenToomey 
Thanks for doing your part in stopping this madness!
@SenToomey let's hope not!
@SenToomey Stand your ground! PATRIOTS STAND UNITED! #GodBlessAmerica
@SenToomey You should have talk to your boy Bush about spending, and making you jerks richer, and us poorer
@SenToomey You have support.  DO NOT LET POTUS HAVE A DEBT CEILING INCREASE. We do not have a revenue problem - we have a spending problem.
@SenToomey STAND UP TO OBAMA BULLYING! He is a THUG, NOT constitutional natural born citizen, a fraud! #ArrestObama #ImpeachObama
@SenToomey it is your responsibility 2 US citizens who elect u, 2 work w/ BO & get the job done. If he had republican across his forehead...
@SenToomey PLEASE hold your ground on that.
@SenToomey rather than grumbling, you should be trying to work with #POTUS His plans make sense #GOPWarAgainstEconomicProgress #Gridlock
@SenToomey POTUS stopped GOP from raising income taxes on all! He did fail to keep GOP from raising payroll taxes though.
This is not about the President. This is about the American people. You just tweeted the problem with our politics  @SenToomey
@SenToomey I hope NOT!!!!!
@SenToomey what's your great idea ?
Take it from the poor and elderly?
Just remember who does the most voting? You will be replaced.
@SenToomey either u pay ur debt or u r a deadbeat and the reason that America is being brought low.
@SenToomey wrong. The debt ceiling needs to be raised 4 what CONGRESS already spent. U r lying and being disingenuous.
@SenToomey I call bull shit.... You cowards will food like a cheap suit. Hit the decision time, the first checks not sent, and you WILL fold
@SenToomey okay, pat
@SenToomey hey Howdy Toomey. Raise the debt ceiling now. We have to pay for your GOP unfunded wars and tax breaks for the rich.
@SenToomey I hope not but my guess is the Republican's will fold, as they always do.
@SenToomey get real, it's the GOP that has a spending problem. pay your damn bills asshole.
@SenToomey We don't want any more years of this Socialist POTUS!  IMPEACH him,  No gun control.  Liberty & small government,
@SenToomey put your money where your mouth is. Republicans have let many Americans down!
@SenToomey Stand firm Senator!
@SenToomey Good! Stop the madness!
@SenToomey I'm pretty sure that raising the #debt #ceiling pays for bills that #Congress already racked up not to authorize new spending.
@SenToomey Republicans never wanna do anything to help the country u jus care about urselves
@SenToomey GOP has also already gotten $2 trillion in cuts. Does that mean GOP wants more cuts to shrink government to drown it in tub?
.@SenToomey I did not vote for you but unfortunately you represent my state. Stop the rhetoric and work with the president.
@SenToomey When are you going to grow up?
@SenToomey Right on.
@SenToomey stay strong no wavering
@SenToomey  Oh, by the way, I am a Pennsylvanian!
@SenToomey Yes, because you guys won't raise the taxes on RICH guys...Oh, Like yourself! Pay your fair share!
@SenToomey
 In what world do you live. If a betting man, you would lose.
@SenToomey It's time for the insanity of wild drunken spending sprees to STOP! Attach balanced budget amendment to Debt Ceiling!
@SenToomey calling the POTUS a liar? Proof!
@SenToomey The question is, what position are you, or any other Senate Republican in to do anything meaningful about it?
@CheesersDurden @SenToomey And shutting down the government isn't a "meaningful" solution.
@SenToomey Can we believe you???
@SenToomey did the koch brothers pull your strings and make you type this tweet? lead follow or preferably get out of the way of progress.
@SenToomey Here's hoping you're right.
@SenToomey That was only an appetizer for the SOB
@SenToomey Demand a return to #RegularOrder on the budget as a condition to raise the debt ceiling. #tcot
@SenToomey That's an utter lie, Senator. If you don't know that, you're incompetent. Since you do, you're unworthy of your title.
@SenToomey Thank you GOP
@SenToomey And what exactly does your solution entail?
@SenToomey Well he should be required to take #Economics101 or simply be removed from office
@SenToomey You are one of those destroying R families & economy We need to picket ur home & refuse to do business w/anyone in ur district
@SenToomey don't agree to another tax increase or you'll be on the chopping block!
@SenToomey until the #GOP does SOMETHING #stfu starving #middleclass is tired of hearing your shit
