@SenToomey I regret giving props after reading this, a clear cut and run statement.Makes me think you were never serious in first place,bum
@SenToomey time to move on is correct. Right outta office. #kickedouttaoffice #traitor&coward.
.@SenToomey Cowardly if you don't try again. #demandaction
@JeromePandell @SenToomey  Constitutional if u don't try again. #benghazi #fastandfurious #gosnell
@lynn_lwrightpcd You're a #moron
@JeromePandell Ah there is the Liberal logic on full display. Try logical arguments not name calling like a 2 year old.
@lynn_lwrightpcd Spouting off a bunch of hashtags for #tinfoilhat conspiracy theories produced by your imagination rightly deserves derision
@SenToomey Please do not give up fighting for gun control amendment!
@SenToomey Thanks for your efforts so far, but I disagree.The 34 people killed in our country EVERY day by guns don't get to just "move on."
@SenToomey we nd #guncontrol  draft another &another &another bill until citizens are safe. @bpshow @TheDailyShow @justinbieber #Guncontrol
.@SenToomey From that statement, I assume u are okay with the guy that u look at n the mirror. I wonder if ur constituents share ur regret?
.@SenToomey oh yeah, we’ll “move on” alright, we’re moving on to other candidates when it’s time for elections & you’ll know “move on” well.
@SenToomey Thank you for your hard work and having the courage to stand up to the NRA. I wish your colleagues had done the same.
@SenToomey PLEASE MOVE ON - TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE. DO NOT PASS GO DO NOT COLLECT $200. U R A LIBTURD TRAITOR.
@SenToomey Why do you think the public would have been safer by implementing gun laws we already know don't work? I shouldn't have voted 4 u
@SenToomey Tell that to the families who've had loved ones slaughtered. They will never be able to move on. How dare you!
@SenToomey The Senate has spoken...time to move on? ....not good enough
@SenToomey YOU MEAN DISARMING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS?  IMPEACHMENT IS WHAT YOU DESERVE!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment#United_States …
@SenToomey so much for all the other important business, huh? Back onto gun control eh. Pat?  The Gov't is incapable of screening criminals
@SenToomey Thank you so much, Senator Toomey, for being brave enough to really try.And thank you for working bi-partisanally.
@SenToomey Your are a traitor to our Constitution !!
@SenToomey it's not time to move on. It's time to fight harder. It's time to reform the Senate. Its time to do something that 90% of us want
@SenToomey Stop sponsoring bad legislation. We already have background checks. You can be voted out if you don't get it together.
@SenToomey Thank-you Senator for your work on back round checks .. Don't give up on it, you can work on mutiple issues.
@SenToomey protect our 2nd amendment!
@SenToomey finally some common sense...
@SenToomey You will be 'moved on' by the voters. We don't forget.
@SenToomey Thank you for your bravery. The outrage is palpable and things must change. So we should not move on. #NRA has too much power.
@SenToomey The Senate has spoken? How about the people? Your constituents are not done talking. We will not accept this.
@SenToomey Please don't give up. As a PA Dem, you could have my vote if you just persist...It's too important.
@SenToomey You pushed for real change Pat, but don't just sweep this loss under the rug and move on, keep pushing for a safer America.
@SenToomey thank you for trying and please continue to try for the children of America
@SenToomey The Senate spoke for itself and for the NRA, not for the citizens. They voted against popular will. That should be a crime.
@SenToomey it never have a chance and you know it you sir are now unemployed
@SenToomey WE MUST CONTINUE THE FIGHT!!!!!!!
@SenToomey The American People will speak next election.  Thank you for your vote in support of gun control.
@SenToomey please try again!! #demandaction
@SenToomey I am very proud of you for voting ur conscience and trying to do the right thing regarding background check. Outstanding!
@SenToomey really? U quit that easy. Shame on you.
@SenToomey 
T U for trying. Background checks for gun ownership helps everyone.
@SenToomey Thanks for standing up for gun control!
@SenToomey it's hard for the families of Newtown to move on and accept this..think of them and take more action
@SenToomey As a constituent, thank you for trying to find common ground. We appreciate the effort.
@SenToomey let's move forward, not on.
@SenToomey Glad it didnt pass. SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!! No new laws would have stopped Lanza would they?  Now time for you to be voted out.
@SenToomey we will be moving on without you, now that we see ur true colors. (Obama fail) Signed ~ Real Patriots. Kiss your career goodbye.
Do what you can while you can @SenToomey, because this is your last term as senator! #Traitor #2A
@kbent88 @SenToomey What? Move on to further weaken the Bill of Rights?
@fstop107 No.
“@SenToomey: It’s not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it’s time to move on.” <==Clown.

Senator, WE WILL NOT MOVE ON.
@IA_Cronopio @SenToomey Que Music. Song Selection:'I'll Be Watching You'. We have taken names. Gun Debate SETTLED in 1791.
.@SenToomey 

Move on?  We will not move on. 

But you will.
@SenToomey I'm a Repub NRA member. Fix the current BC chk first. Mandate all State entry of mental records & make Fed pros BG chk denials!
@SenToomey As a conservative/libertarian, my only regret is that you continue to hold office.
@SenToomey it's not time to move on time to keep trying to keep our nation safer esp. with the recent tragedies that have affected us all
@SenToomey what would your children want you to do; give up/fight harder?  Better yet, what would you tell ur children to do? #guncontrol
@SenToomey excuse me but last time I checked, the senate is supposed to represent the majority! The majority wants #guncontrol! Fight harder
@SenToomey Go Ahead, Take a Failure Bow http://bit.ly/15mWT9P  #movementstaketime
@SenToomey sounds like you're giving up???
@SenToomey It's not time to move on.  This is an important fight and another mass shooting is not an acceptable outcome.
@SenToomey Might I suggest making it easier for families to involuntarily commit their mentally ill family members?
@SenToomey Move on to where? More profiles in cowardice?... If they can't fix this what can they fix?...
@SenToomey - Well I guess I know who I wouldn't want in a battle with me. This dude just cuts and runs at first sign of resistance.
@SenToomey Your only regret should be not listening to the overwhelming voice of the people who put your undeserving butt in office.
@SenToomey Where will you work next?
@SenToomey Don't you understand that America already has too many gun laws and we don't want or need more?
@SenToomey Yep move on to another job because you will not be a PA senator next election read my lips no more Toomey #teapartytraitor
@SenToomey The Senate has not spoken. It confirmed its impotence.  Will you be a voice in real filibuster reform
@SenToomey <= LOSER! We elected you to be a principled conservative. We got Spector part two. #NowIsTheTime to elect a new senator.
@SenToomey Thefact that you hoped to intrude on our Rights, gives us pause! We need new Representatives in DC. Shame on you ! focus DEFICIT!
.@SenToomey And the voters will not forget your attempted betrayal of our 2nd Amendment.
@NoChromeHD oh trust me this was no ATTEMPTED betrayal. @SenToomey OUTRIGHT BETRAYED CONSERVATIVES AND 2ND AMENDMENT. WE WILL NOT 4GET THIS
@SenToomey ...there's a reason...but let's not forget who authored it Pennsylvanians!
@SenToomey @OCAmericans You are a traitor to the Senate Conservatives Fund that elected you and it will not be forgotten Mr. Spector
@SenToomey Thankfully it did not pass.
@sentoomey @truble72 We will NOT move on. Those bastards will be voted OUT, along with their NRA bribes & blood money.
@SenToomey have you often the message? Now we will take our vote to remove traitors. 2A is a RIGHT not a law, not open to ur legislation
.@sentoomey  You should only be concerned with PROTECTING our 2A rights.
@SenToomey You amendment violated the Constitution and destroyed medical privacy.
@SenToomey No don't move on. This is only the beginning....
@SenToomey time to move on!
@SenToomey still voteing you out. You are to protect our Constitution not attack it.
@SenToomey  This is not about guns, it's about some who dislike our President so much they will vote against anything to defeat him & gloat.
@SenToomey maybe everyone will forget when your term is up so you can keep your job. Be glad it didnt pass- now you have a chance to stay
@SenToomey hard to believe the Seanate did the right thing. Good luck on re-election. PA goes all blue
MT @SenToomey: My only regret is that our amendment did not pass. The Senate has spoken and it’s time to move on.
@SenToomey You reap what you sow
@SenToomey you must be kidding.  Move on?  That just shows that you really did not care about this bill.  No blood on your hands!
@SenToomey And 2016 will be the time for you to be defeated. #getlost
@SenToomey Goes to show what 2A means to people.  SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED means something.
@SenToomey You were played by Schumer
@SenToomey the Senate has spoken?!? What about what we the people have said you anal tumor
@SenToomey your amendment gave Eric Holder free reign to add in any regulations he pleased including registration, that is why it failed!
@SenToomey Applaud you for trying to do something in a Senate known for its inaction, but certainly don't think it's time to move on.
.@SenToomey oh well gosh, guess that's that. Dum de dum de dum
@SenToomey used by the democrats like a suppository now ready to be discarded with contempt and purpose
@SenToomey we nd #guncontrol  draft another &another &another bill until citizens are safe. @bpshow @TheDailyShow @justinbieber #Guncontrol
Time for YOU to move on, pack your bags senator. MT @SenToomey only regret is amendment did not pass. ... it's time to move on.
@SenToomey sadly,chances of being reelected in #pa will probably not go your way, either. Get used to defeat.
@SenToomey #PAWillNotForget
@SenToomey pack your bags
@SenToomey Thank you for attempting compromise. Wish more would follow suit. It's the only way to accomplish anything.
@SenToomey next election you will be voted out for your treason and treachery towards We the People who elected you and our Constitution
@SenToomey thank for attempting to do both the right thing and the will of the people.  Shame
@SenToomey Happy that you and 53 other public servants were not allowed to regulate my freedoms away from me today. #cleanoutthesenate
@SenToomey No it's not. Time to stand and fight for those who can't.
@SenToomey PS: We understand that you live in a liberal state, but why not run as a liberal, big-federal Democrat and be honest about it?
@SenToomey Your only concern seems to be re-election
@SenToomey Please do move on, all of these #guncontrol measures up for vote must be defeated #TheyWon'tWork Protect2A
@SenToomey It's time for you to be voted out of office! You backstabbed all conservative/teaparty/constitutionalists.
@SenToomey How much $$ will I have to donate to your primary competitor next chance I get? Don't know, but willing to find out.
@SenToomey We won't forget. #NRA
@SenToomey it's time for you to be voted out of office!
