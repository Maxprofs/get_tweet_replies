@J_wege
AT LEAST YOU TRIED! @SenToomey @FWproud @SenTedCruz  That is even more than we are getting out of the House on it!
@SenToomey @efricke @SenTedCruz disappointed too but not in the least surprised-why are they so intent on covering this joke of a president
@walkerkpt @SenToomey @SenTedCruz Scared of something?
@SenToomey Let the truth be the truth. What are they afraid of.
@SenToomey @CarolHello1 @SenTedCruz of course they blocked it! They are  protecting Hillary and the POTUS #Benghazi
@SenToomey @RedNationRising @SenTedCruz Speak LOUDER American's! The Senate Still does not understand they work for the PEOPLE! Vote Wisely!
@SenToomey @Daggy1 You betrayed America on the second amendment--it will not be forgotten!
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Another long term mystery we are wrestling with.
@SenToomey @GaryBlackal @SenTedCruz Every time they deny access it becomes abundantly clear to Americans this Adm. did something illegal.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Praying for both of you!
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz An Admin. of lies and deception. Who in their right mind would reelect any of them? Vote 4 people with principles.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz They r afraid of the truth. B/C the Admin. carelessness caused deaths & they don't want 2 risk their reelection. Sad.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Pat, please be a thorn in their sides:#SenateDems until the adults take over the US Senate
@SenToomey Are you saying Cruz was collaborating with you on this project, or are you saying he opposed you?
@SenToomey @AmberGirl3 @SenTedCruz 

RAISE HELL IN FRONT OF EVERY CAMERA YOU SEE!!!!
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz ...so how is a jobs bill looking....?? Education?  Anything?
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz hey
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz 
The cover up continues...
@SenToomey @Kevinbsnyder @SenTedCruz typical from shithead @harryreid
@SenToomey @NewsNinja2012 @SenTedCruz Disgusting I want the truth!
“@SenToomey: I am very disappointed the #Democrats blocked my res w/ @SenTedCruz to get answers for those killed in #Benghazi” Predictable
@SenToomey well please dont lay down & stop.  KEEP PUSHING!  Pa's are on your side
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz You shouldn't be surprised.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz 
#OBAMA wants govt shutdown NOT REPUBLICANS.  #defundObamacare #dontfundit #tcot #teaparty #Obamacare
@SenToomey 
Most Americans want Congress to #defundobamacare. #defundnow http://heritageaction.com/2013/09/morning-action-congress-defund-obamacare-now/ … … via @Heritage_Action #tcot #dontfundit
@SenToomey @fitzfam2000 @SenTedCruz  Then keep trying. Wear the dems out until they give in. Block everything till they cave!!!!
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz so sorry! I hope America will speak at the polls!
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz try, try again. It's high time the senate took up the issue.
@SenToomey @RedNationRising @SenTedCruz What are they hiding? It's reprehensible #JusticeForBenghazi4
@SenToomey @Hamilton4TX @SenTedCruz Impeach them all.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz what is wrong with the Democrat party. Are they puppets
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz WHAT are they hiding?
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz So call a press conference and ask the people why Senate would do this?
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz Please dont get disheartened sir. We are behind you!
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz That's because your resolution was a joke. Benghazi is a phony political issue just like Teddie Cruz is a phony.
@SenToomey  @SenTedCruz Sen Boxer only knows one way cover-up Benghazi....
So are we! MT“@SenToomey: I am very disappointed Senate Dems just blocked my res 2 get answers 4 the families of those killed in #Benghazi”
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz They will be remembered in 2014/16!
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz no kidding! Hillary and Obamie have a lot of explaining thwy have skillfully avoided #lyingcheatingpoliticians
@SenToomey @NewsNinja2012 @SenTedCruz Then all these DemonRats need to be impeached as well!
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz Disappointed but not surprised I'll bet. Have you thought about crying partisan like Dems do?
@SenToomey @amandacarpenter @SenTedCruz they do not want the truth out. That would be impeachable.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz  RT @B4INObamaBirth: 46 Of 99 U.S. Senators Vote To Give Yout Constitutional Rights To UN http://b4in.com/i1MB 
.@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Gentlemen; We appreciate your efforts. Those against the #Benghazi investigation will be called out.
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz They know the truth will come out, very sad state of affairs with this administration
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz Dem senators are cowards!
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley It can only mean, they have something to hide. Why else?
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz How can they do that? We DEMAND the real truth, how can the Senate not make that happen??
@SenToomey @amandacarpenter @SenTedCruz Did they say "what difference at this point, does it make?" #Benghazi
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Don't let go of it.
.@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz.So transparent that they're protecting both former SoS Clinton and Pres Obama.  Dems don't want truth
@SenToomey @sentedcruz @NewsNinja2012 I feel for you, shame on you #Democrat go after them #tcot
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz Unacceptable. Start getting those subpoenas going.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz  you go boys! Do not let up! #hidingsomething
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz what are the questions?
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Look for every camera in DC & get the story out. Repeat it 'till you can say it in your sleep. That's the Dem way.
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz Let the world know who these Dems are and let's have them voted out of office. Keep demanding answers.
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz Dems don't want answers. The truth scares them. Even those bot in on it. Ignorance is bliss
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz  I have come to expect nothing less from them. They are very nearly...evil.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Senator Toomey, we are often judged by the company we keep. You are better than this. Ted Cruz is a hack. #Benghazi
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz That's because #SenatorHarryReid is a #HillaryClinton Supporter!
Get on FOX and get the news out .@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz  communicate it and citizens will respond!
@SenToomey @MonicaCrowley @SenTedCruz stupid democrats
@SenToomey @sentedcruz You're disappointed. America is F'n pissed
Keep fighting @SenToomey & @SenTedCruz Maybe at some pt my gutless Sens @SenGillibrand & @SenSchumer will believe families deserve answers.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Life is a series of disappointments, Keep trying. I haven't had a boner since 1996 but does that stop me? #NoWayBub
@SenToomey @dkdk459 @SenTedCruz 
If Sen Dems block the quest for truth, they bear responsibility for wrong doing, & are part of  cover-up.
@SenToomey @amandacarpenter @SenTedCruz You and your disappointment and $2.50 will get you a ride on the subway.  DO MORE.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz complete cover up. Security denied, seals denied, CIA on ground denied. Why and by who? #answers
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Dems cooperate with no one. That's why U disappoint when you do so with them. TY 4 trying. #Benghazi still imp IMO.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Everything has been answered. It's political theater of the absurd now and you know it.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz Trying to keep this issue in the public eye until 2016 to stop Hillary ?  Stop wasting our time & money & get 2 work
@SenToomey  NEEDS  SHOUTED FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOPS THAT THEY ARE BLOCKING THE INVESTIGATION OF DEATHS BECAUSE IT COULD LOOK BAD ON CLINTON
@SenToomey @sentedcruz probably a matter of "national security" or something, eh?
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz And Benghazi happened because Congress cut security funding. THAT MEANS YOU.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz I want answers on why a Navy Yard and an elementary school were fired upon.
@SenToomey @SenTedCruz QUIT BEATING A DEAD HORSE AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL.
