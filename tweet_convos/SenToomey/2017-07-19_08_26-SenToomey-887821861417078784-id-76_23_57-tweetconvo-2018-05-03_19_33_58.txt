If I bring my (objectively cuter) dogs to Washington for you, will you promise to protect the ACA?
Do you even own a dog? It is creepy to see you fawning over a dog while voting to ax life-saving healthcare for $$$. Who r u paying off?
@SenThomTillis, unless Tilly made a significant campaign contribution, I doubt she'll get @SenToomey's vote.
What about saving American healthcare? That would be cute.

Pennsylvanians cuffed after sitting in Sen. Toomey's office asking for health care to be protected. #StopTrumpCare 
Pitchforks
Shouldn't you two be working on Health care legislation?
I think this dog must be running Pat's social media. No other explanation for how fluffy it is.
After he paid Toomey then Tikney voted for the dog
Aw. They are adorable as they conspire to cause the suffering and death of millions so that the wealthy can have tax cuts. So cute.
Did Tillis pay him? That seems to work.
Look at these two grinning idiots.


When is the next REAL townhall for REAL PA petulant pat? Read the Constitution, you work for us, not the kochs #UnfitToServe #TrumpcareKills
This picture you shared sums up how out of touch you are with the real world. No self-serving tax cuts for millionaires like yourself
This is what he does instead of listening to his constituents.  Grow a set Pat and have a real Town Hall in Philly.
Pat, your constituents want to to talk to you about #healthcare !
@SenThomTillis ... @SenToomey will be happy to vote for Tilly...

...all it's going to cost you is about $100,000.
Perfectly galling and banal given the dire moment. #SaveMedicaid
Yet you just follow with out a care in the world your bosses healthcare #skinnytoomey
Really?
Is the dog a Republican? Wealthy? If so, it'll likely get @SenToomey's vote.
Now? Youve got time for this?
Should be lobbying nonstop on Obamacare FULL REPEAL not some idiotic dog contest. You're being paid to legislate! 
How about we vote for which of the 32 million Americans should die first in the GOP game called health care reform...
dt demands they work thru their august break he skips out the entire month of august Like they get 1 scoop, he gets 2 scoops of ice cream
"the cutest dog on the hill contest " it isn't easy with around 40 choices .. oh, cutest.. not dumbest or most paid off. n/m.
Gosh, why can't all Pennsylvanians be a pampered showpup and just have their handlers pay for their health care??
I hope Tilly is a rich white able bodied man otherwise @SenToomey won't be inclined to vote for your dog.
That dog cares more about people than you do, Pat.
This PA constituent (19144) demands that you do NOT vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I support #ACA & I vote. #SaveTheACA #NoRepeal
So glad for this important work. No wonder we have no idea what's in #Trumpcare, up 4 vote soon!
Keep doing work like this on the hill do you don't mess up important things please. Inaction will be far better than Trumpcare
Ahhh, life is full of fairy dust and Trump's magical healthcare plan is gonna be so super terrific and amazing." Isn't that right Tilly"
@SenToomey will vote for a cute dog but will vote against healthcare for his constituents!
> That feel when Senator Toomey releases the hounds on healthcare protesters
Toomey would vote for any  on the hill
Call his office 202-224-4254, protest his office, show up everywhere Toomey shows up
If he won't budge, call his donors and complain
#resist
Really? You don't have anything else more important? Have an in person town hall. I'm sure your constituents could give you many ideas
dog's done more to help PA than Sen Toomey
How many days until summer recess? You have got to be kidding me.
Glad Comrade Pat has time for dogs, but not for his constituents.... thanks for nothing Koch lackey!!!   Town hall never....

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
Mgr to mgr, @SenToomey, you wouldn't hesitate to fire someone caught doing this on social media at the expense of mission-critical work.
*me neither. You feel me?
@SenToomey, this is not what we pay you for.
Maybe you could take a minute from your #superbusy schedule to listen to actual #realPA voters.
People WILL DIE and your tweeting dogs. people see new CBO JUST RELEASED 32 million more lose health insurance and premiums WILL INCREASE
Human garbage Pat Toomey takes time off from uninsuring 10% of Americans to touch a dog without its permission.
How about I'm sick of paying for those bums and he's listening to the voters who put him in office.
Glad you're having fun while the rest of us worry about our children's future. I guess even people who rob the poor need a break sometimes
I'll vote for his dog to replace him in office.
He can play with the dog all he wants as long as he votes to repeal Obamacare. It's sucking the life out of working people.
I'll bet he has the best vet care!

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ â€¦ 
@SenToomey only votes yes if there is a campaign contribution involved.
Please tell us you will have a town hall instead of this foolishness  ?
@senToomey do you think a picture with a cute dog will make us forget that you want to take healthcare away from 32 million Americans?
He doesn't care to try anymore, it's out in the open. We all know he is beholden to the Koch bros
How about I'm sick of paying for those bums and he's listening to the voters who put him in office.
Hahahaha okay.
You know you lost, right? You know you never voted for Toomey in the first place, so why the fuck does he care what you want?
OMG Rome is burning they are voting to kill millions of Americans and they are playing with dogs???!
How about I'm sick of paying for those bums and he's listening to the voters who put him in office.

This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
Tully gets more attention than his constituents.
How about I'm sick of paying for those bums and he's listening to the voters who put him in office.

A tweetstorm, just for you, @SenToomey ...a little more than 21 years ago, my wife and I attended our first childbirth class
He has time for this nonsense but not to hold a townhall. What a disgrace.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Well well well
Is this on taxpayer dime or your unpaid time? This is more impt than working to #FixTheACA?
And these are "our"elected representation ? Holy Fuck, we're in worse trouble than I imagined..
Any idea Y the president doesnt have a dog? Seems un-American! Well, so does meeting w/a foreign government or its representatives #resist
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahha you LOST!
How sweet. Would be even sweeter if @SenToomey spoke to any of his constituents abt healthcare. His DC office doesn't pick up the phone.
