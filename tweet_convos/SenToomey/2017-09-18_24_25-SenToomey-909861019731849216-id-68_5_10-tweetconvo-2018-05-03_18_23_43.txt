Tonight at 6 & 10 on @69News, my interview with @SenToomey about tax reform, his dinner w/@realDonaldTrump and more 
Vote no on this farce of a bill!  Your political career days are numbered regardless so do the right thing for once.
That can wait...VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy!!
Call his Allentown office. You can talk to an actual human.
I live in pittsburgh and have already called. This is too important...worth repeating at every opportunity to any pair of eyes...you noticed
I called him, Casey, Graham, Murkowski, Flake, and McCain so far.
Thank you!
Please let people know, too, if they are not comfortable making calls (some folks aren't) they can text or write via @botresist Super easy!
Thank you! I should probably do this. I'm a bit wordy on the phone. Polite...but wordy. 
I like it for the opposite reason. Not fond of calls - am much more articulate in print. @botresist  is a genius idea!
You need the reform Senator!
Don't forget to tell u don't support your constituents you only vote party lines w tx the hell out of the mddlclas&haveNO plan 2 help w hlcr
#TaxReform = #TaxCutsfortheSuperRich while @SenToomey guts healthcare for the rest of us.  Was that included in your interview?
To you both tax reform and healthcare cones down to how much you can take from middle & working class & give to the rich.
Why couldn't your staffers answer basic questions about the #GrahamCassidy bill when I called?
I couldn't even get a staffer...
I would rather you have a real townhall.  Not a sterilized event where you control the questions.  Have an actual conversation.
How about talking to your constituents?  Town Hall, open, unscripted.
How about speaking to your constituents about healthcare?
How about talking to your constituents #CowardToomey #KochSuckerToomey
Before he gives $$to his rich donors,Toomey plans on taking PA earmarked healthcare dollars to give to other states.

Did he force you to eat meatloaf too?
Vote no on graham Cassidy bill. It's garbage. PA doesn't want it.
I'm glad you're enjoying so much, Senator. Such as ripping healthcare away from thousands of your constituents.
FACT
Vote no on healthcare bill without CBO score.
And when will you speak with the people of Pennsylvania!?!? Like....hmmm....TOWN HALLS???????
Cool.  Did @realDonaldTrump tell you he'd release his tax returns?  Oh well..Special counsel Mueller is probably analyzing them now anyway.
Call it what it is--tax breaks for the wealthy & large corporations.
How about worrying about what theCassidy bill would do to PA . Where will the billions for southern states come from. What is your cut?
What did the state of PA do to you to make you hate it so much?
Too bad you don't enjoy speaking to your constituents in an open town hall!
#eatadick

Senator this isn't about YOU it's about Pennsylvania  VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy.  No one wants this bill but you.
A call to impeach Toomey! Worse Senator in Congress & we have the misfortune of his representation!
Quit!
You are too corrupt to be in office.
Your slashing of health care will be followed by tax breaks for the very rich. Then in your next election, we will be rid of you. @SenateGOP
Grahm/Cassidy what will be your reason for steeling PA residents money & sending it to non Medicaid expansion states? Represent PA, not GOP
When is town hall?
Call it what it truly is - tax breaks for the wealthy anything else is a boldfaced lie!
Please don't pull the healthcare rug out from under the feet of your constituents!
I'm respectfully requesting that you vote against this latest effort to repeal the ACA. It is the cruelest version of Trumpcare to date.
You're clearly only doing this for your Koch funders.
Are you supporting #GrahamCassidy which will destroy millions of lives? Was not able to get thru to your office. Left voicemail.
VOTE NO on Graham Cassidy like your job depends on it... because it does. Your #PinkSlipIsComing you #SpinelessCoward
Vote against #GrahamCassidy, Senator Toomey. $850 million in cuts to  Pennsylvania.
Please don't vote to repeal healthcare from millions of people!
Nice distraction tactics, rest assured if you pull healthcare from millions we pull you from the Senate!
No one cares, you're trying to repeal healthcare under cover of darkness. Your constituents have roundly rejected this, cease and desist!
It's time to do the right thing and stand up for your constituents - vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. This would destroy our healthcare!
For all Toomey followers, I suggest you also follow @SenBobCasey and @GovernorTomWolf  as he is silent on upcoming vote to kill ACA
Pat, Don't buy into the latest iteration of Trumpcare, the bribes given to red states at the expense of blue states will hurt PA folks. SAD!
#GrahamCassidy is a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor, sick and elderly. Don't hurt the people of PA.
Vote no to the Graham-Cassidy bill! I still make the call, if I can get through.
Your tax "reform" is actually enormous handouts to your billionaire donors. If you are so against welfare, why give it to them?
Reminds me. Time to call. Which one of your offices is answering? Will you vote yes on latest effort to remove health care for millions
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
If you could only do bipartisan then we might get a bill that does not change.  You are whiners I hope we can vote all r out
Tax reform = tax breaks for the rich. Screw the middle class and poor.
Is that a Sinclair trump station?
Please vote no on health care bill. It is not going to end well for anyone. Let's be smart about this as a country.
It'd be great if you'd actually speak to us, your constituents, in a real townhall...
He would dodge giving any real answers. He is a practiced liar.
You're such a good lapdog with those Americans for Prosperity talking points.
I'm a PA voter. Please vote no on Graham/Cassidy. I cannot afford my meds w/o health coverage
Please vote against the medical bill.  However R have not shown compassion or care about healthcare.  That's ok we can vote d in
Oh, nice. More softballs about your bankrupt ideas.
