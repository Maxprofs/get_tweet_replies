@SenToomey showing your ability to comprimise, & for bipartisionship will take you far. Put amer. people first, will take you far
@SenToomey: Neither side gets all it wants, but this protects 99% of taxpayers #FiscalCliff 
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THIS 4 WKs AGO?
I expected the yes vote out of @SenBobCasey but not out of @SenToomey. I thought he would have thought it out better. Very disappointed
@SenToomey With all due respect Senator, how do you control SPENDING with this deal? Forward to Greece we go. Grow a backbone.
@SenToomey Tax relief not real problem.  Watch stock mkt,  controlled by flash trades, add tax and change fee to income
@SenToomey Kudos to you & Senator Casey by showing leadership, putting aside partisan interests & doing what's right for the US. Thank you.
@ACE_Fitzgerald @SenToomey You are a moron Fitzgerald! Along with Daddy's Boy Casey!
@SenToomey Thanks for taking the high road! You bring honor to Pa.
@SenToomey So says the RINO!
@SenToomey I thought you were 'sposed to be our knight in shining armor.
@SenToomey 99%?  Better check your math Senator
@SenToomey - You broke your tax pledge for no real spending cuts and can't sell it any other way.
@SenToomey Bullshit.
@SenToomey Shame on you for voting for a tax increase
@SenToomey Do you realize what the backlash is going to be when people see get next paycheck and have 'less' because of the payroll tax?
@SenToomey And now you Dems will support spending cuts so expenditures will fit into the projected revenue now?  Didn't think so.
@SenToomey lost my support in #PA
@SenToomey I call Bullshit! You and the other spineless asshats caved. You stand for nothing!
@SenToomey No spending cuts to speak of equals failure. #fiscalcliff
@SenToomey @JohnCornyn Bull. Payroll tax back to 6.2%. 5 obamacare tax hikes. Hold for REAL TAX CUTS NOW OR GET OUT OF OFFICE. WE R BANKRUPT
@SenToomey You did the right thing. Props for that. I am not usally a fan, but am a big fan for what you did today. Thank you, sir.
@SenToomey @johncornyn The SenateBill does absolutely NOTHING for spending cuts which are DESPERATELY needed for our nation. Ds wont cut!!!
@SenToomey  not McConnell model but it is how Obama works, wait for the crisis and push Crap thru. Do not pass bill
@SenToomey you are an idiot. The GOP didn't get anything! Cuts at a later date? Trust a person who has not passed a budget in 3 years?
@SenToomey You guys need to get a clue.  You have absolutely no idea what we the people want.  Get ready to lose your job at election time!
@SenToomey Thank you Mr. Toomey!
@SenToomey $41 in tax increases for $1 in phony spending cuts? What, exactly, has been fixed?
@SenToomey where are the spending cuts!
@SenToomey ITs a BAD DEAL !!!  Should have been laughed at-- NOT supported !!!!
@SenToomey Where is the spending control? It doesn't exist.  Conservatives got nothing but a spanking and an education from liberals.
@SenToomey $41 in tax hikes to $1 in spending cuts and this is worth voting for? What a joke!!
@SenToomey U shamed WeThePpl. STAND DOWN STEP ASIDE.No more 1/2 meaure.All should force media conversation 2spending&senate NoAction. @AFPhq
@SenToomey Please oppose the upcoming gun ban being introduced by Feinstein on 1/3/13, & protect the 2nd Amendment.
@SenToomey sorry - the deal STINKS to high heaven! would you tell me please where the spending cuts are to offset the deficit & cut into it
@SenToomey would love to sit down with u /your staff & explain what is needed to bolster this economy #serioustaxreform for small business
@SenToomey And where are the promised spending cuts? You just lost my vote and follow.
@SenToomey Taxing the over $400K will reduce jobs and decrease income potential for middle class and will not solve the debt. Good? No Way!
@SenToomey 2 years to cut spending and Senate gets an F- for not doing so. Americans are outraged you guys cannot do people's business
@SenToomey @robertcostaNRO: FreedomWorks lashes out against deal http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/dean-clancy/key-vote-no-on-fiscal-cliff-deal-0 …
@SenToomey But it dooms 100% to the continued explosion of our federal debt. How is that good for America? Why would you support that?
@SenToomey bullshit you are cowards, the GOP is a disgrace! You should've ashamed!!!
@SenToomey you and Cornyn should be ashamed
@SenToomey I'm a constituent and disappointed in your vote and your use of leftist ideas about taxation to defend it. You've lost your way.
@SenToomey  We r  proud of @marcorubio for standing strong along with the few others that had courage. Shame on  rest of you including KS!
@SenToomey shame on you- there were enough Dems & lib GOP to pass this- should let them own this- own the economy - #fail
@SenToomey #ObamaTheExtortionist "I will increase everyone's taxes if you don't bend to my will."Disgusting we have such a leader!
@SenToomey You're kidding us right? That is the biggest bunch of elephant crap I have ever heard, you're all weak, every one of you.
@SenToomey Thank you for compromising and showing that we can find solutions. Now on to job creation!
@SenToomey  you sir should be ashamed of yourself for not standing for the people. The president needs to be put in his place and you know
@SenToomey The only "permanent tax relief" is to make real spending cuts.  #FiscalCliff #FAIL
@SenToomey you got nothing to rein in fed spending, a tax increase on income, and a payroll tax increase on everyone. What did you get?
@SenToomey I am sure there is a bunch of hidden garbage somewhere .
@SenToomey What a mealy mouth statement..u did just enough to get re-elected, proves you're a DONKEY like all the Dems
@SenToomey You sold us out pal Going over the cliff would have taken a big bite out of deficit; better than any last minute deal
Good grief. RT @SenToomey: Neither side gets all it wants, but this protects 99% of taxpayers with permanent tax relief #FiscalCliff
@Gunservatively @SenToomey - It sucks. Tax increase for all or none
@SenToomey It does NOTHING to address the real issue in this country: SPENDING. As a PA conservative, I am disappointed in your vote.
@SenToomey Thank you for voting to help the middle class. Now it is time to compromise on everything else so that you can solve problems.
@SenToomey and raises spending 41 to 1, and raises taxes on my employer, my trash hauler, and my home builder.
@SenToomey No meaningful spending reductions = bad deal.  GOP giving up on what's best for America = shameful and tragic.
@SenToomey Please tell me were the spending cuts are...this doesn't seem to do much to rein in the mismanagement of our gov't.
@SenToomey Amazing.  I can't believe YOU said that.  Arlen Specter would be proud.
@SenToomey U voted 4 this & u r Worthless & Useless! U gonna try & take our guns now? better not try!
@SenToomey freaking joke of a deal. Where are the real conservative leaders!
@SenToomey disappointed.  We thouhelping would help explain spending kills. Please speak  up and force msm and congress to focus on that
@SenToomey An excellent outcome on the tax side. Good luck with spending decisions.
@SenToomey  way to go! I thought you were a fiscal conservative! No vote from me next time around. You didn't protect anything
@SenToomey Did you at least read the bill
@SenToomey you and the senate fucked us $41 in taxes with $1 spending cuts golf clap.... Golf clap
@SenToomey 41:1 new taxes to "spending cuts" is a joke.  What's the point of electing Republicans to Congress?  #gop #cavein #caring
What about spending? RT @SenToomey Neither side gets all it wants, but this protects 99% of taxpayers with permanent tax relief #FiscalCliff
@SenToomey For now, while others pay for the out of control spending. signed John Galt
@SenToomey No such thing as "permanent" tax relief.
@SenToomey wish u could have done this sooner. Use this a model for future compromise to get meaningful legislation through.
@SenToomey and increases the payroll tax #dumbass
@SenToomey For now. If you think Obama is satisfied you are as dumb as a box of rocks.
@SenToomey Where are the spending cuts?
@SenToomey your vote did not speak for your constituents.  you should have been one of the 8 to vote no. It's the spending.  Shame on you.
@SenToomey ur actions will not solve the deficit. May cost people jobs. Hope u feel good about urself. How can u tweet this failure? Famn
@SenToomey dear Senator. U failed plain and simple. U were to not raise taxes and u did. Principles and our future is more important. Bad
@SenToomey where are the spending cuts? When will the #GOP stop being gutless and reign in spending? Our future is at stake. #TCOT
@SenToomey Where's the govt spending relief and economic growth 100% of taxpayers need?  Permanent tax relief for whom?
This deal does nothing to protect 100% of us from spending crisis. RT @SenToomey "this protects 99% of taxpayers with permanent tax relief"
@SenToomey ALL TAX, NO CUTS...? GOP are idiot pandering traitors @ will be FIRED for this fatal error.
.@SenToomey not cutting spending endangers ALL Americans. Good luck in your next primary, I won’t be voting for you.
#Are_You_Smarter_Than_A_Fifth_Grader? Obviously Not! ~ Higher Tax Rate on Small Business, #But No Spending Cuts @SenToomey
@SenToomey So is it true $50k or more paycheck earns you a 2% payroll tax increase?
@SenToomey why would you wait so long? It's disgraceful.
@SenToomey bull crap - you passed a bill without even knowing the full impact - your as bad as the rest of congress - you lost my  vote
@SenToomey Obama rubbed your nose in the dirt. You got nothing.
@SenToomey Say it ain't so, Pat...
@SenToomey Only when the entire country is forced to pay for all this "benevolence" of Obamanomics will there be a reckoning.
Um, spending cuts? RT @SenToomey Neither side gets all it wants, but this protects 99% of taxpayers with permanent tax relief #FiscalCliff
@SenToomey Unfortunate. Tax increases for those making between $250,000 and $450,000 should have been included in the deal as well.
@SenToomey Agreed Senator lets hope we have turn the corner on this
@SenToomey <= You're a sellout, why are you proud? Tell your kids and grandkids what you've done for them and see what they say.
@SenToomey Permanent until O's promised tax inc demands. You guys are all in cahoots. No cuts/hope/change or surprise. @GOP TY @marcorubio
@SenToomey Quit crashing the dollar. You quit on us. Both sides are out of touch when your $ has no value but our $ must be monitored.
@SenToomey I was and still am proud that I voted for you. However, I am extremely disappointed that you voted for this "deal." #BeAnExample
@SenToomey you caved, $620 billion in tax increases to $15 billion in spending cuts (as reported) is NOT compromise. The problem remains.
@SenToomey where are the spending cuts?
@SenToomey U should be ashamed of this! I had faith in u. U could of let them own this crap!
@SenToomey but what does it do for spending
@SenToomey Without doing anything about the deficit.  You must be VERY proud, sir.
