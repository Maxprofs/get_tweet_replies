Good thing he has Great Health Insurance Huh (The VA) he'd be screwed Big Time if he had the plan you want for the folks in PA. #GoldStarDad
Trust me, the Mayo Clinic where he was treated ain't no VA.  I'm sure he wouldn't subject himself to what the avg vet receives.
Okay- that's true- but you get my point :)
Of course I do.  And I didn't mean to be flippant or callous.  I think the way we treat vets is a disgrace, and I'm so sorry for your loss.
I agree- Thank you we also have 3 other kids who are or have served of our 5 - I've dealt with @SenToomey b4 http://thedailyripple.org/index.php/ripple/gold-star-dad …
This breaks my heart, truly.  I can't imagine any parent not being more empathetic with your family's service and sacrifice.  Sen. Toomey?
Feel free to share it- so folks can understand who he really is
Please also consider the cost of his healthcare, and what if would mean for his family if he wasn't a Senator.
Would he have had access to the Mayo Clinic under your diabolical health plan? Somehow I doubt it!!!! Hypocrite.
No doubt @SenJohnMcCain is grateful he can get the care he deserves. Ironic that you don't recognize your cuts will deny this to millions.
VOTE NO to Trumpcare so other people can keep their insurance and have surgery!
McCain will be fine.
You should have your head examined.
...or your soul cleansed.

Activists sit in to #StopTrumpCare at @SenToomey's office @DemSpring @OurRevolution  https://www.pscp.tv/w/bDu2ejFBbVF6Z2dMWEF3S2V8MXJteFBxYXZMemRLTsESNYv9owdcQOibdKGQzCoXphiGm-bCySW9Apaw7s6I …
Best wishes to John McCain! Get well!

.@SenToomey's constituents now sitting in his office urging him to vote no on GOP's repeal bill & protect care for 22 million. #KilltheBill 
Could you also keep in mind Americans who don't have the great insurance coverage he has? Don't kill them with your Toomeydeathcare bill
He voted to begin debate, and said he was against the bill! Did you even watch!?
Repeal all senators #healthcare
Hey imagine providing more than thoughts and prayers, aka healthcare, to everyone regardless of societal merit. Imagine the United states.
You should keep his taxpayer-funded health coverage in your thoughts, as well
How about keeping America in your thoughts as you screw with our healthcare? #breastcancer #survivors are against #TrumpCare
So glad he's got good health insurance, shame you don't care about Pennsyvanians that won't.
Keep those in need of medicaid support on your mind and stop supporting ridiculous Senate health care bill.  You are callous to many Amer,
It's great that @SenJohnMcCain is getting the treatment he needs. Don't deny it for others!#NoBCRA #SaveMedicaid #SaveACA
On the cusp of 'rolling back' the last 7 years of progress with ACA, going back to the bad old days of worthless insurance.
KILL THIS BILL!
Most intelligent thing you've said since elected.
Keep the American people in mind when you stick a knife in their backs. #wewanthealthcare  wake up your health package is bad
Thank goodness he had good insurance and didn't die on the street.
You lose! The trumpcare bill is dead!

Pennsylvanians cuffed after sitting in Sen. Toomey's office asking for health care to be protected. #StopTrumpCare 
Just try to imagine if you or your wife were ill and couldn't afford treatment, Pat. It's a reality for far too many Pennsylvanians
Good thing this war hero has health insurance.   What about the rest?   #CowardToOmey
Yes, and his hospital bill will be covered by insurance, over $70,000. What about the rest of America!!!!!
What would his surgery cost? 72k? At least he has his, and his surgery saved so many Americans. Another McCain sacrifice
I am a constituent. My zip code 15223.
Shame on you and any senator that approves your wealth care death bill  http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/bcrarevision0714_0.pdf …
Please also keep Pennsylvania's children in your thoughts and vote against the BCRA
McCain is lucky to have comprehensive government provided health care. You know, the kind most Americans want.
Wow if JOHN McCain had the health insurance I can afford he'd probably lose his house. And you're trying to take That away! How can u sleep?
What, no prayers too?
Please do not allow 20 million Americans to lose health coverage. Support the ACA, not replace.
Yes glad he has health care. A good man
Thank god for Obamacare
Inaccurate to say Republicans did not contribute to ACA, but otherwise see opportunities for bipartisanship in this
***John McCain*** torches BCRA on its deathbed: 
Says start over with bipartisan process. 
He has insurance many constitutes will lose theirs. Vote NO to TRUMPCARE bill. This vote determines your political future!
Me too, must be great having healthcare to pay for your surgery while you delay a vote to take it away from millions. You're all crooks!!
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/13/15966034/senate-republicans-exemption … Oh so generous

NEW POLL: Majority of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling healthcare http://hill.cm/8Qcg2fu  

The losses in federal funds to protect health care benefits for Pennsylvania’s most vulnerable are unacceptable and insurmountable. https://twitter.com/GovernorsOffice/status/886955553817325568 …
Sort of ironic you and the senate have health coverage, and now you delay the vote to remove ours.  #byebye2022
Thank goodness Sen McCain you are taking care of this now , before #Trumpcare ,,,OHHH WAIT you all are exempt... #NiceWork #DoAsISayNotAsIDo
The fact you cant stand up for the most vulnerable in PA proves you have no business calling yourself a United States Senator! #Trumpcare
Stop LYING about Obamacare. #GOP stop sabotaging and START FIXING AND GOVERNING!
Good thing Senator McCain has excellent health insurance coverage...too bad for the rest of us.
As are we. Lucky for him you've excluded yourselves from the healthcare destruction you want to impose on the rest of us. #criminalGOP
You do know that Trump is not liked very well. Stop supporting this fool. You also know that you will be voted out if u don't change.
The health care fight is far from over. What can you do?
 Call Congress at (202) 224-3121
 Write your Senators
How about you also keep your constituents who are going to lose their healthcare if you pass this shit bill in your thoughts too.
Thank goodness he has insurance!!
Wow imagine if he had #BCRA ... he'd probably end up bankrupt... nice to have the govt paid for health insurance isn't it ?
Sen McCain is so fortunate to have health care to save his vision. Shouldn't everyone be so fortunate?
Does Toomeys "thoughts" include the elimination of McCains Medicare? How about deleting his Medicaid?

Not keeping the thoughts of people needing assistance though.  #toomeyisafraud
Good thing he has the best health insurance, the rest of us can only pray we live thru ur Let them Die Healthcare plan!
I want the government out of my health care.  To much waste and fraud.  Perfect example is the VA.   Is that what you people want?
Good thing he has good health insurance to cover this procedure. Why do you want to take away your constituents' insurance?
so glad that socialized medicine could help with his pre-existing condition.
Good thing he has the excellent healthcare you senators make sure you have, while stripping away ours...
senator McCain I'm glad you have access to adequate healthcare
I think instead of slashing Medicaid for poor people in order to cut taxes on the rich, you should slash insurance for senators.
.@SenToomey What about your fellow Americans who will lose access to doctors, hospitals & medicine because of your lack of courage?
No they won't. There will be other options. Dont forget tbe millions of Americans KICKED off their plans and FORCED onto Obamacare.
Glad he's got good health care! Why don't you want that for your constituents. That's a lot of you accepted. Is that why?
#KillTheBill
If you believe any of this, I have a health insurance plan you're going to love
Blah blah, your touching post is fake news! Do something for your constituents, we're drowning under this regime!!
Vote against the Senate's proposed health plan. It's an abomination.
Time for you both to take it easy, maybe start a small backyard garden and feed the pigeons. Your time in DC is done!
If republicans would find ACA it wouldn't be failing
How about everyone gets what you get? Problem? I thought so
Glad he doesn't have your healthcare that for sure
So glad you both have taxpayer provide healthcare that you'll keep while giving your wealthy friends a tax cut.
Please keep American citizens in your thoughts as you vote to take away healthcare from millions of people. SHAMEFUL.
We are keeping you in our thoughts as you take away Healthcare from millions of people less fortunate than you. Have you no shame?
Oh. So you do support tax payer funded healthcare?
52% of Americans prefer the ACA. you are supposed to represent us.
Keep 22 million Americans in your thoughts as you rip healthcare from them.
Just not the rest of Americans when it comes to their healthcare
Must be nice to not have to worry about losing your health care. I wish I could feel the same.
Wish you would think of the millions of people who will lose insurance under the GOP plans! Estimated 26 to 44k more deaths a year!
Do the right thing. Vote no.
So, you'll keep him in your prayers, as he avails himself of government funded health scare, while you vote to take away ours?
What about the rest of us!? Don't take away healthcare!!! #shame
You should keep the of people in your prayer who will lose coverage if #Trumpcare #Trump every becomes law. Some of them WILL DIE.
Do you pray to The Koch's?
Yeah, you want his health care vote. I am disgusted by partisan politics and health care laws drafted by MEN ONLY.
Feign consideration much?
How fortunate for his great healthcare. Unlike the rest of us after your votes. Uncaring, hypocritical christians, the lot of you.
Hey, I bet he'll do fine with that government sponsored insurance of his.
Your support for bad healthcare bill shows you think rich ppl like McCain deserve health access but mid/low income don't/should pay more.
Imagine needing that surgery but not having health insurance that will cover it. That is the future of your bad healthcare bill. Vote NO!
The Republican Congress is targeting the poor and sick. Tens of thousands will die if 15 million lose coverage next year + 22 million later.
Are you ever awed by your hypocrisy the way we are? #wealthcare #anyonebuttoomey2022
Hopefully, he has better insurance than the Trump(doesn't)Care you are trying to shove down the throats of your constituents.
While u r thinking of him, think about the millions of people who u will be screwing out of healthcare
Good thing he has excellent taxpayer-funded insurance, which you are trying to take away from taxpayers.
Good thing he has decent health insurance.
The irony that the bill dismantling health care is being help up because a man with excellent insurance had surgery is mind-blowing.
Wow, some people are such idiots!   Healthcare needs to be reformed.  Pass the bill and keep working on it.  Best wishes to Sen McCain
He has good health care. He will be fine...
lucky for him  Congress's healthcare will still cover pre-existing conditions and no high-risk groups.
Hope you are also keeping the lives of Pennsylvanians in your thoughts.
The rest of us won't fare as well after you vote to take away our health care. No worries - you get to keep yours!
Good thing he has great insurance, huh?  The rest of us won't be able to say that if you pass this awful "healthcare" bill.
I wish John McCain a speedy recovery & I pray you and McCain will reconsider making HC unaffordable for ppl with pre-existing conditions
Good thing he has insurance. You know, like what you're trying to take away from us. 

Speedy recovery, sir.
Please also keep @dennisg_shea and his daughter in your thoughts.
Honestly, you keep no one in your thoughts except yourself.
Sure am glad he has a healthcare plan we will never see.
You think you are safe because you don't go up for re-election for 5 yrs but PA residents have a long memory. We won't forget you screwed us
Pat, you're going to sign your family up for one of these Cruz plans, right?
Hey @SenToomey how about making everyone a Senator so we all get good health insurance. Also, that way, you would have to talk to us?
Thank god congress' benefits don't hit people with pre-existing conditions
Your health insurance will pay for anti anxiety meds, enabling you to meet with constituents, Senator Snowflake.
Good thing he has comprehensive medical insurance.   You're a monster, Toomey.
Also , that his eyes would be opened to repel ObamaCare
Me, too, but are you going to keep "in your thoughts" all of the people for whom you're going to kick off of health insurance?
Would this now be a pre existing condition for Senator McCain under the BCRA? Good thing the Senators have such good health insurance...
I bet you are, Pat. You need his vote desperately for your TrumpCare travesty of a tax cut.
Also keep the 22 million Americans you will leave without healthcare in your thoughts as you work to pass Trumpcare. #VoteNoBCRA
Also thinking of Senator McCain... but I will trust Senate health care plan when it's the same one Senators use themselves. #healthcare
Good thing you guys kept Congressional healthcare in #BCRA despite taking it away from millions of Americans.
Pennsylvanians need access to top notch healthcare, too. Please vote NO on the new healthcare bill.
I am also!  Good thing he has excellent health care coverage!Will the Senate also be subject to pre-existing condition clause? #SinglePayer
He'd be a pre-existing condition on the health"care" plan you're voting on. Just like me. Don't take my ACA. My blood will be on your hands.
Why don't you listen to your constituents and not take their health care away? Senators shouldn't have better care than we do.
What will you think of all the people who won't have health insurance next year because of #BCRAP?
When you offer amends to AHCA making that the Cong health plan, then maybe your PA constituents will believe you. Best to JSM 4 recovery.
good thing he has health insurance. forever.
@TuesdaysToomey @toomeytownhall @TuesToomeyHBG @TuesdayToomeyLV
How about keeping Pennsylvanians in your "thoughts" and voting in their best intetests instead of your own??
You are a Koch crony.
Thank god he has good health insirance. Or so you want to take his away too.
Do you also keep in your thoughts the millions of Pennsylvanians that your bill will kick off health insurance?
Surgery he received from the health care we provide for him but will not provide for all!
Even as a dem, I love John McCain. I wish him well. You should be caring for PA. You'll find out what we think of you in your next election
He is wished well from PA. Good thing he has health insurance. #BRCAKills #DoTheRightThing #ToomeySoWrong
@SenateGOP Thank goodness he's not under #Trumpcare, huh? #NoBCRA #TrumpcareKills 

I support the #ACA and I vote.
Paid for by the ACA and the American ppl, no less! But yes, let's wait for his return to take health care away from the rest of us!
Agree.  We need some level headed Republicans in the senate to balance your views, Senator Toomey.
Why won't you meet with your constituents, @SenToomey?
Good thing he has health insurance!!
Notice you saved his health insurance...and your own. Epic hypocrisy. Your complacency in treason is outrageous as well..
A picture is worth a thousand words, can you prove to me this is wrong ?
Any room for the other 22 mill Americans in those thoughts? Or do your fellow R senators and the Koch bros take up all remaining space?
Excellent health care that allows you to go to the Mayo Clinic is a wonderful thing.
Keep PA in ur thoughts &prayers as you vote to make it more difficult for the most vulnerable to afford healthcare. Profiteering hypocrite.
Sucks he has to have surgery before he lost coverage. Oh wait, ya'll will still have it & paid for by US. My bad.

A tweetstorm, just for you, @SenToomey ...a little more than 21 years ago, my wife and I attended our first childbirth class
Are you thinking about how fortunate he is to have health insurance?
Fortunately Sen McCain will have great healthcare ...what about all those who will lose healthcare because of your bill ?
He went to the Mayo Clinic.
My thoughts are on the millions of fellow Americans that you're about to screw over. #coward
Good thing he is not from Nevada

Glad he had Medicare to take care of him.
TFW you wanna subtly tweet out for a reminder to your sick colleague to repeal healthcare access to millions but aren't sure how to do it.
I'm so glad he had insurance so he was able to pay for his surgery
So do we. #Healthcare is life or death. Pls listen to ur fmr coworker & #ProtectOurCare. #NoBCRA in #RealPA

Which we tax payers gladly pay for; but you want to de facto kill the rest of us peasants yet take our taxes. Poor return on investment!!
And may his own thoughts turn to what would happen to 22M who would lose insurance under BCRA if they needed same surgery

This is Evan. When Republicans talk about cutting Medicaid & giving tax cuts to the wealthy, it’s health care for kids like him on the line. 
He was able to have insurance that he will get to keep unlike the millions you want to take it away from

DIRECTIVE 

Action Call…
I say if you think this health care plan is so great everyone who votes for it has to use it 
WE WILL REMEMBER COME ELECTION DAY  #RESIST

RM: @MartinHeinrich: Republicans' latest health care scheme threatens to throw our entire health care system into chaos. 
Hope you also have #TrumpRussia in your thoughts as well. Lots of treason, you know.
Toomey stated earlier when asked about HIS healthcare coverage-  "I'm doing great?  How you doin?"
Hoping McCain recovers with the great health insurance you rebubicans are trying to withhold from seniors
