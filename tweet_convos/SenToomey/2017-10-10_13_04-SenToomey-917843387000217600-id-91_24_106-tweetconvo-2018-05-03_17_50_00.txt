President Donald Trump greets the Penguins at the White House Tuesday. 
You congratulate a team forced to meet with the man who's out to disrupt our democracy? Will you grow a spine & stand up for America?ever?
Meanwhile, in the real-world, @realDonaldTrump threatens press (in most specific way yet), threatens PR, undermines State Department 1/
Meanwhile, @SenToomey sits silent, 1 more Republican finds a spine and the Constitution. Shame on you!
Mr. President:
Are you recanting of the Oath you took on Jan. 20 to preserve, protect, and defend the 1st Amendment? 

Kansas Tried a Tax Plan Similar to Trump’s. It Failed.

Not Trump's plan, it is a club for growth/ @SenToomey plan.  No evidence it will create jobs.  Lots it won't.

Trump and Republicans want a big tax cut for the wealthy, claiming the gains will trickle down to the middle-class. Don't fall for it. 
Guess you have things in your closet too to be so into the President. https://www.scribd.com/doc/316341058/Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-Rape-Lawsuit-and-Affidavits … Wonder if you treat women similarly?
Yup. Also, wonder if Pat knows that theres no statute of limitations 4human trafficking? #trumpmodels #SteeleDossier
I just came to see all the comments from everyone against you as usual. Is anyone on your side, ever @SenToomey ??? #pittsburghhatespat
Bootlicker.
This is not leadership but rather propaganda. Sad that the Penguins were manipulated by Trump.
Hi Pat. Done anything worthwhile lately? No? Didn't think so.


Today, @realDonaldTrump will come to Pennsylvania to push tax plan that gives 80% of benefits to the top 1% of the county.

Poor guys.  That's quite a punishment.
Congratulations on being the donkey making many residents of your state pay a lot more in taxes so you and the Koch boys can save a little.
how appropriate for that group to stand with fat boy Donnie.
Not one black dude
& shame on peduto for not showing up & using his office to play out personal grudge against our president he's an embarrassment to our city
What are going to do about Trump being unfit to be President?
Ay toomey just swinging by to remind you that you are part of the cancer that is the GOP and it’s a real shame PA is stuck with you. Resign.
Yeah, that golf bag will get a lot of use  #penguinsshade
@SenToomey Dont you have puppies to kick or ladies to tie to railroad tracks?? #yourmommustbesodisappointed
You shouldn't use their names your your corrupt publicity. Far more a classy organization than your dumpster fire of a party. #cheetos

Well done, Pennsylvania voters. Well done. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/920029594811551745 …

No time for this stuff. ARTICLE 25, BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. There is a #Madman in the #WhiteHouse about to start a #NuclearWar for God's sake!
Do you not see the circus that Trump has created? The world is laughing. Your legacy will be your fear to stand up to Trump. #ImpeachTrump

says Only guilty ppl pleadThe5th #TrumpRussiaCollusion #MuellerIsComing #SteeleDossier #TeamTraitor #UnhackTheVote
Feel it’s important to keep you informed about issues facing Pennsylvanians. Your staff seems to be failing you. Thought we should help
Those Canadians don't have to worry about how loony the guy in the Whitehouse is
Not to worry... Both #climate change & #nuclear #war are undoubtedly #global events.
@mattfreedpghpg @PGSportsNow @PittsburghPG @PGVisuals they are white Canadians, of course they were invited
1/Is this fun4u? The sadist in you is just thrilled, innit?Terrorizing Americans by threatening2take away their healthcare wasn’t quite vile
2/enuf.So u allow a mentally incompetent Russian asset access2the nuclear codes.That’ll #maga right?! https://twitter.com/aynrandpaulryan/status/917932102951223296 … #25thAmendment
GOP source says Kelly and Mattis discuss what to do if Trump lunges for the nuclear football.

Let that sink in.

I guess you need to focus on happy horseshit, nothing good to talk about. Hey look, a shiny object.
Senator Toomey is a party hack. His reference to WH visit by Penguins is because he is a Trump lap dog.
NO one Took a Knee... ohhh wait ...color does matter,,, MY bad
Quit!
Would that they had declined to meet with him and sully their achievement.  Why can’t you see it?

I really thought you had more moral fiber.
Wow... they're all White. What a shock.
Pretty disappointing actually. Worst part of winning would be having to meet trump.
They should have all taken a knee
And this is your priority while millions of children lose their health care?  Maybe you should consider taking the IQ challenge, too.
@SenToomey did you wait to declare your support for the @penguins until empty netter of game6 ...like you did with @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump : FYI most hockey players are immigrants.   They just aren't brown immigrants. Might be confusing for a #Dotard
Well,  congrats on winning, at least.
We face multiple crises caused by #UnfitTrump. #DoSomething 2 protect us. Restrict his ability to 1st strike #NorthKorea. Save #CHIP & #ACA.
A team so white I gotta wear shades!
Pat, we're still waiting for news on a Town Hall. Also, why did you let CHIPS expire, 9 million children without health ins. PA is watching.
The idiot in chief isn’t worthy of a visit from the champs. Very disappointed in the poor decision on the teams part. #ImpeachTrump
Well Wanda let’s not get triggered here okay hon? ‘‘Twas their decision not yours. I though liberals were in favor of choice
Guess you weren't invited.
No thanks pat - you suck!!
Hey Pat, the @Penguins had a few hundred thousand at their last town hall event.  How about you??
With the Moron on the WH may be the last Cup. Do something!
Sooo, Pat, what about our kids who may lose their CHIP benefits?  College kids who may lose their Pell Grants?  Oh, right, you don't care!
Proud of my Penguins but a town hall would be awesome.
Wow, you know Pittsburgh exists! How about a town hall here? Or at least having your staff answer your phones?
Now, now! We, Pittsburghers, are only worthy of voicemail & disrespectful staff who like to scream at you.  Thought you knew?
How about you travel back to pa and have an open non staged town hall????
What are you doing about CHIP? How about you hold a town hall? In Philly.
Disappointed the pens would go when such a divisive man is living in the White House. I applaud the golden state warriors.
Distraction, distraction, distractions Tax Toomey..tell the people of Pittsburgh about losing State &Local tax deductions
Congrats to them for supporting peaceful protests.
Things that should B celebrated have lost meaning because seriousness of country’s condition & YOU are ignoring it and OUR REAL CONCERNS!
Embarrassing. But in a mostly white league what do you expect.
The Canadian guys should've skipped. The Moron is trying to jerk Canada around on NAFTA.
Hey, how about a townhall meeting during your recess? We can talk about the Penguins.
Exactly!! Or the Flyers!
More interested in the athletes who boycott that chump, but thanks.
More interested in your comment on this, Pat.
So, Pat, are you one of the few exceptions, or are you in the vast majority here? PA'ians deserve to know. #BobCorker #CorkerUnmuzzled
