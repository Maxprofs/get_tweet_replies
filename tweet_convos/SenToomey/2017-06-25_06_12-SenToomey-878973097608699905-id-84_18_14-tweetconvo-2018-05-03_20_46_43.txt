Ask them how they can justify a law that would take away the Life, Liberty and Happiness of millions of Disabled Americans? #ADAPTandRESIST
it does guarantee the right to life and liberty and this law does take those away.
@SenToomey have a townhall... this is garbage.
This is real news. Not fake fox. So why did you LIE?
#CowardToomey won't face his constituents face to face.
Senator Pat Toomey has decided to LIE to the people of Pennsylvania.
Two very disturbed looking individuals.
Please ask our Senator Toomey when PA can have a town hall to discuss this healthcare bill with him. Would be his first town hall since 2015
@SenToomey does not represent PA, he represents GOP
-and yet you won't talk to us what's up with that. Townhall now, sir
FTN! WRONG TWITTER HANDLE FOR TOOMEY _ SHOULD BE @SenToomey
i bet toomey won't tell you if he's voting for it until the last minute, but then vote for it b/c that's what he always does
Of course he is voting FOR it!! HE was 1 of 13 "men" butchering OUR rights!!!
They're immoral liars who'll be directly responsible for more American suffering and deaths than any terror group #GOPDestroyingAmerica
Toomey is a yes no matter what. Tweets, calls, protests, sad stories, insults, facts, and dead people are annoying but..he's a YES, move on
He needs to know he's failing his one job: representing the people of his state. There's no "moving on" from this. Few issues matter more.
He know's but does not care. All the pressure matters little. He has 5 yrs, then u vote him out. Until that time he is yes on ALL things R
I tried to vote him out in the last election. Unfortunately he got voted back in.

#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #Noahca #NoBCRA
@SenToomey. Are you willing to have the same health care that you are forcing on the rest of America. If not then you should not vote yes.
Get their take on the @NationalADAPT protesters many of whom were there constituents, who were arrested because this bill will kill millions
^^^ this. #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Police drag away protesters, some in wheelchairs, outside of Sen. McConnell's office after draft of Senate health care bill is revealed 
This really bothers me as these people could have spinal cord issues. Dragging them away from their chairs. How much damage was done ?
No one was seriously injured. But the real Villians are the ones who brought us there. The GOP Senators.
Thank you for your strong stand to protect the healthcare of all Americans! #TrumpCareCutsMedicaid #AHCAKills #HellerVoteNo #NoCutsNoCaps
They misled as always.  This bill is murder.  Premeditated murder.
@SenToomey, we'd like you to face your constituents and hold an in person town hall. We've set some up for you, but have yet to see you.
Toomey is lying about Medicaid cuts. @FaceTheNation @SenToomey @PatToomey @BillCassidy
Pat T won't have a TH citing security risks. Casey had one yesterday with one colleges campus security guard. Answered questions 4 2 hours
Not so much as one heckler
Can you confirm there were none? Also, I heard that the audiance was pre-screened.
I was there. No prescreening. People put up their hands and the microphone was passed around. A very polite crowd.
Thank you for your straight account. I have seen lies and more lies on social media.
PA is disgusted with Toomey in every way !
@SenToomey Vote no. Oppose. #AHCAisIMMORAL 15126
I didn't hear anything about reducing costs, insurance company and hospital operating costs need to be lowered but this is not addressed
Republicans happily target the poor and sick!
Wonder what @SenToomey will say? Will he mention "personal responsibility?" Somehow I missed Personal Responsibility 101 in nursing school
Hold @SenToomey accountable to his tax breaks for the wealthy and abandon the most vulnerable policy.
Yeah, that Toomey is making his Koch masters proud, lying out both sides of his face. Evil SOB, disgusted that he has another 6yrs.
Be interesting to watch him lie as that is all @SenToomey does to his constituents. Does not vote our interests
Toomey is working hard to make us a 3rd world country!
Toomey is a failure to our state! He is a cancer on the human race!
Toomey will go on tv but won't hold town halls and face his constituents face to face. Hell, he won't even talk to them. You work for us!!!!
@PatToomey is THE WORST! Clearly in the pocket of big business and could give a shit about his constituents. How about a #toomeytownhall?
Where are the TV bricks we used to have in the late 70s
What Sen Toomeynwon't say aloud. This bill not about healthcare. It is to give more $ to his rich donors
Swear to god, if this turns into some kind of infomercial for these two... Do NOT let them lie their way through the interview.
...& they can't always be lowered by cutting fraud & Medicaid is already more efficient overall than private insurance..this is a #MEANBILL
Toomey is just a Republican Clone so I expect he'll degrade Obamacare and praise the current Senate bill. He's pathetic.
How ironic Toomey will be on Face The Nation. He can't even face the people of PA.
...be capped on a per capita basis...and the health care costs for disabled persons don't stay steady over time..costs can rise...
..every State each year adequately funds the gap in funding for disabled persons' health care costs because the US govt medicaid exp would..
I live in Harrisburg, PA THIS IS A #MEANBILL All persons with disabilities would have to fight 50 battles every year to make sure that....
The Senate bill to "repeal Obamacare" repeals the US govt's 1965 promise to always care for 100% of disabled person's health care needs
@SenToomey @PatToomey @BillCassidy Sen. Toomey wants to murder Veterans like me by taking away healthcare. He's a monster.
Ask Toomey why he won't meet with constituents. Oh, and tell him we remember!
#NOCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …
Please ask @SenToomey why only 13 men behind closed doors worked on this bill & about cuts to Planned Parenthood and effect on women
I want them to be on same healthcare as the rest of us. Ask them to repeal their federal healthcare since ours will be so wonderful.
You mean we get to hear their lies?
Could you ask #ToomeyTheTool why he thinks tax cuts for his rich donors are more important than healthcare for the working class?

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
Ask Pat Toomey why he has held ZERO town halls with his PA constituents. Ask why he ignores our phone calls.
Ask why he has been M.I.A. and why he has been hiding from us.
Many people in my county are insured because of the ACA and the Medicaid expansion. They have been able to get lifesaving care.  Ask
why he would vote to strip their health insurance away from them. Ask why he is beholden to lobbyists and won't represent his constituents.
Show Pat Toomey this thread: @VABVOX is one of his constituents. Does he not care? (h/t @TuesdaysToomey)
I can hardly breathe today. Even w/oxygen. It's unhelpful that it's the 2 year anniversary of the pulmonary embolism that almost killed me.
They don't care. That is a feature for the R party.
Let them explain why they think Trump's anti-healthcare act is good then challenge them with hard questions & facts.
@WhatsPatUpTo @PatToomey @BillCassidy plz also ask Pat about 777,000 people in PA who will lose coverage under #BCRA
The only way the Senate, or the House, is going to create a workable healthcare bill, is when they have to go on it with everyone else.
Wow! You got @PatToomey to speak abt Senate repeal of #Obamacare! Amazing. No one in PA has been able to find #Toomey since last year. #AHCA
@SenToomey is very appreciative of all constituents who made possible for him to cash a fat check while taking your #Healthcare rights away
@SenToomey is the worst Senator in the history of our great Commonwealth! No softball questions, hold his devil feet to the fire!
what kind of monsters would take healthcare away from sick children and seniors .... to give the wealthy elite more tax cuts
If you let either one say that the ACA is dying or has been a disaster, you will have failed to do your job.
^^^ this too! @FaceTheNation
Please ask Cassidy these points that refuse his criteria
