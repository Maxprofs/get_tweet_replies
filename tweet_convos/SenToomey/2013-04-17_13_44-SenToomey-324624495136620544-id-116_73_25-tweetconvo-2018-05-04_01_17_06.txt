@SenToomey You should have done what was right according to the Constitution/ Founders, not what you thought was right
“@Gman5769: @_PatJohnson_ @SenToomey Agreed! I know where my vote will go next election.” <-- not for Toomey!
@Gman5769 @grousebum @_patjohnson_ @sentoomey count me in
@SenToomey You did. Thank you.
Shows a troubling lack of judgement. RT @SenToomey I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.
.@SenToomey What UR missing is right in verbiage of #2ndA. Read its last word - "INFRINGED". What U offered IS MORE infringement. #tcot
@SenToomey I own several weapons and went through a background check each time. Everyone should do the same: it only makes good sense!
@SenToomey You DID do the right thing. THEY didn't. Do not give up. Do NOT give up.
@SenToomey should have done something with criminals and mentally ill not law abiding citizens. Support bills for stricter/longer sentences
.@SenToomey you thought wrong.
@SenToomey please try again
@SenToomey did the right thing. Keep fighting for what's best for the American people! Thank you!
@SenToomey Bad judgement Senator. Infringe means to take little bites away from rights. Your bill infringes. You joined the enemy
@SenToomey WHY WOULD YOU SUPPORT THIS?  YOU SWORE TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AND NOW YOU HELP OBAMA ATTACK THE 1ST AND 2ND AMENDMENT?
@SenToomey AND YOU'RE TRYING AGAIN YOU TRAITOROUS SCUM!  IMPEACHMENT IS WHAT YOU DESERVE!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment#United_States …
@SenToomey maybe U should consider doing what the people who elected you think is the right thing Your job is 2 represent US who voted 4 U
@SenToomey  WE ARE PULLING ALL OUR SUPPORT FOR U SENATOR, MONTHLY DONATIONS BY 6 FAMILIES IN PA HAVE BEEN STOPPED. UR A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
@SenToomey proud to have voted for you.
@SenToomey No you didn't, jackass. Stay off the booze cruises and do your job. Stop giving Obama phony issues to talk about.
@SenToomey Thank you for your courage to do what's right!
@SenToomey thank you!
@SenToomey The 'right thing for our country' would have been the obvious, pass a bill that 90% of americans agreed with.  #disapointed
@SenToomey you were wrong. The Constitution is what's right for our country.
@SenToomey and may God have mercy on your soul
@SenToomey A defacto gun registry is NOT the right thing for our country. Turn in your flag lapel pin, please.
@SenToomey Thank you, Senator.
Great effort @SenToomey.  My only request as a PA voter:  Don't give up.
@SenToomey We will remember you tried to vote  on a change to gun rights come election time
@SenToomey   Nice effort, Pat!  I, for one, am happy to see a Republican using common sense.
@SenToomey How sad Senator. The Constitution is right for the country. #tpp #tcot
@SenToomey jackass. YOU'RE FIRED!
@SenToomey our politics cldnt be more different but thank you for at least having the courage to try.
@SenToomey As a PA resident, thank you.
@SenToomey Your next election, WE will do what's right. You lost the support of the people who put you in there. Pat is now Arlen Jr.
@SenToomey and you did what was right for the people of Pennsylvania and the 90% of people in the US who wanted some action taken.
@SenToomey Thank you, Mr. Toomey. I am a Pennsylvania voter who appreciates what you did.
@SenToomey. Yes you did. Keep fighting
Did you not read my cautionary tweet 4 days ago? Now you look silly. MT @SenToomey I did what I thought was the right thing. #GunRights #2nd
@SenToomey Thank you - you absolutely did do the right thing, and the majority of people in PA are grateful for your leadership.
@SenToomey "God save us from people who mean well."
@SenToomey This would fix nothing.
@sentoomey @jaymic24 Then U R SORELY out of Touch w Productive,Lawful members of ur Constituency+Deluded. Step Down,Sir!
@SenToomey How was anything in that bill helping the country? You were addressing a symptom, not the problem: criminal behavior. #tcot #NRA
@SenToomey No Senator you didn't.
@SenToomey Sorry, you thought wrong
@SenToomey You might have begun by doing your own research on background checks instead of accepting Dem anti-gun propaganda at face value.
@heatpacker @sentoomey for Bloomberg ad money. I voted for you but you've lost it
@SenToomey At least you have exposed yourself to voters as a gun grabber and no longer can claim to be a Conservative. #RINO
@SenToomey sir the right thing is Defend USConstitution against ALL enemies both foreign and domestic...shld inc socialist Democrat libs.
@SenToomey So did the fools that voted for Obamacare and many of them are at home in their pj's now wondering what happened.
@SenToomey Oops.
@SenToomey It Was the right thing & Americans agree with you. Thank you.
“@SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.”.well, you were wrong and need to be pro-constitution
.@MilamBill @sentoomey:  since when is eroding a constitutional right doing what is right for the country?  #primarysentoomey
Resign immediately, traitor.  “@SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.”
@SenToomey  We appreciate it.Just can't understand those who voted against background Cks.  A way to protect kids from school shooting.
"I" that's the problem!! “@SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.”
.@SenToomey   a win for our constitution
@SenToomey we are out here fighting to save what is left of our Constitution. This is the issue you choose to "get your name out there" for?
@SenToomey it wouldn't have done anything to stop criminals from stealing guns and committing crimes. Just a fact.
@SenToomey Sir, you didn't take an oath to do as you think best. You took an oath to uphold the Constitution.
@SenToomey Pat, we don't doubt your hard work, we just want to make sure you are working for our rights. This bill was teetering w/ danger.
@SenToomey it wasn't
@SenToomey nice try, although I didn't vote for you last time, I damn sure will now. It's a shame your colleagues forget who they work for.
@SenToomey Time to polish up the ol' resume , Arlen
@SenToomey Thank you for being in sync with the 58% of the country that want stricter laws on gun sales (source: Gallup 12/19/12).
@SenToomey if you did it would have been more clear on interstate transport. And that mental health can report to police or a judge not NICS
@SenToomey I guess it wasn't the right thing for the Country...#protectthe2nd
Admirable. Try again with a better bill. RT @SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.
@SenToomey You have lost my support. #2a #NRA
@SenToomey we all applaud you for your efforts
@SenToomey you idiot your ass was used by Dems and now sir we know you don't defend the US CONSTITUTION negating your OATH! #you're fired
@SenToomey Thank you for doing so much to keep us all safe. Never give up the fight.
RT“@SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.”
@SenToomey I know. We will not forget.
@SenToomey - You did the right thing. Don't give up.
@SenToomey the right thing is to uphold and defend Constitution
@SenToomey you might have to switch parties, sir. #PrimaryToomey #PATCOT
@SenToomey HORSE SHIT you did what you thought best to advance you
@SenToomey then start decreasing the role of federal government. Stop the laws,laws,laws. We have enough.
@SenToomey do the country a favor.. Don't "think" anymore. Thanks.
@SenToomey Yep, too bad you have all those R's against doing the right thing.
@SenToomey Too late for your sorry...pack your bags. #retirementisuponyou
You are resigning effective immediately? @SenToomey 'I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.'
@SenToomey That bill Toomey was so weak & watered down it wldnt help stop gun violence at all! If it had been koolaid it was missin koolaid
@SenToomey you did the right thing. you listened to the 88%...so thank you for at least trying!
@SenToomey Well then clearly upholding and defending the Constitution isn't important to you. This will b remembered come election time. #2A
@SenToomey And most of your constituents thank you for it. You have my respect. @MomsDemand
@SenToomey You did. Thank you.
@SenToomey The right thing is to keep the focus on criminals, not burden the law-abiding with yet more gun control. Work with #NRA.
@SenToomey and 46 did what WAS best for the country.  #MOLONLABE  Protect our #2A stop growing government control over us.
@SenToomey Because u failed us, we can no longer support you. U ignored LEO & the informed law abiding citizens. Fact. Feelings don't count.
@SenToomey Thank you for trying.
@SenToomey u represent pa not the country
Feet of steel “@SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.”
@SenToomey You were wrong Senator.
@SenToomey You represent a state, do what's right for that state. If you do, it will be what's best for the country.
@SenToomey The #Constitution is NOT subject to a vote by Congress FYI
@SenToomey we can still get it done! Thank you!
“@SenToomey: I did what I thought was the right thing for our country.” That's the problem "You thought"! Did you listen to the people!
@SenToomey and i appreciate that sir, but next time, you might call a conservative before you do this again...#thanks
@SenToomey How about upholding the Constitution !!!!
@SenToomey Senator - leave the 2nd admendment alone - focus on getting out fiscal house in order
@SenToomey Bummer...wrong again.
@SenToomey thank you.
