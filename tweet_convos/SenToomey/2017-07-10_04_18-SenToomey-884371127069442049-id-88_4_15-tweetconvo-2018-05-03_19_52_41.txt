Senator, meet your constituents in an open town hall please.
https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/884427405603024899 … I'd like to find out why the FBI wasn't called, and why impeachment proceedings aren't scheduled.
When a Russian agent calls to offer dirt on a political opponent, a loyal American will call the FBI.
To discuss that you're finally agreeing to #killthebill? That you realized: lives of those requiring healthcare is > billionaire tax cut?
Go away bot
Sorry to disappoint you, actually a PA constituent, wondering why @SenToomey  billionaires but hates elderly & people needing care.
Is it OK to take money from billionaires? It's their mpney
Is it okay to take a disproportionate amount from the middle class over billionaires? Was that what you meant? Because no.
Your money is YOUR money, take the same % of tax from everyone
Because that's totally happening right now. Roughly mid 20s last year. So, it's #absurd.
20% of a billionaire is much more net money than 40% of a regular person, no?
More of the same lies on your "it's not a cut" greatest hits tour?
He doesn't even realize that he's lying, anymore. It has become true to him. #NoConfidence
When are you going to put country before party and people before power? We are waiting....
You ARE "Polyannish" as you say.
Real Town Hall not Fake social media events
#meetyourconstituents #townhallnow
Yeah always where the money is but never with your constituents!
You DO "throw people off of medicaid". You LIE.
No substitute for town hall. Why are you hiding?
#Trumpcare will hurt children, elderly, and poor, all for a tax cut for the rich. Scrap it and work with Dems to find real health solutions!
What's up with Mika & Joe? They endorse Trump early on, only later realize the devil. Now they give you air time 4 your fake song and dance.
Hey scrotum-face hair-cancer victim, when are you going to stop supporting @realdonaldtrump and stand up for this country?
once again making the rounds on tv instead of making the rounds in person in Pennsylvania with your fellow Pennsylvanians! such bad priority
You LIE. "ObamaCare is failnig" as you say due to Republican sabotage.
#RealPA went to ur #AllenTown office 10 mins from ur house 2 talk #healthcare Sat. Toomey?
Thank you for going everyone! 
Town Hall. In person. Unscripted.
he did a town hall a couple weeks ago.
By definition, I wouldn't call an invite, hand selected, small gathering a town hall. But that's just me.
Please listen to my request to amend the DUI LAWS.
Who cares.. You don't tell the truth!
Senator you should seriously start listening to your constituents. We are telling you to vote NO, but your not LISTENING!
Still hiding from constituents. Going on tv is not the same and a 1 min notice GET REAL. When are you having a real town hall
It's great you are on CNBC Senator, but we need you in person, where we can ask you questions and talk face to face. We need town halls!
Thank you for stepping out and voicing your concerns with Russia!
once again I can afford my health care but not cable
It is estimated 7 million WORKERS who currently receive their Health Insurance through WORK will lose their health insurance with #TrumpCare
squawk; what you did on @MorningJoe today.
noun
a loud, harsh or discordant noise made by a bird or a person.
Not surprised it's "up next"
PAT TOOMEY is a bigger threat to AMERICANS HEALTH AND SAFETY THAN ISIS AND THE TALIBAN COMBINED
I am a #constituent and am concerned over #Russian connection. Tried to leave phone #message but box full
Sure be on a show that pertains to people with money but one that "real" PA residents can NOT watch because we live paycheck to paycheck
Sure hope someone ask you why you won't hold Town Halls ANYWHERe in PA, @SenToomey
Another chance for you to spew bigotry, hatred, and lies.  You're an immoral liar supporting the ravings of the traitor @realDonaldTrump.
Here's how we feel abt your #Deathcare bill in song. #12DaysTrumpcare #ProtectOurCare #RealPA
Toomey looking for love. Sad little man who everyone dumps on just because he's a Trumpster and wants to help his billionaire buddies.
Will you be explaining why you want to gut health care for millions?
Really? Did you say anything new? Or is it the same bull u have been lying to Pennsylvanians 4 years now. Why should we believe a word u say
Try talking to your constituents you cant stay float the trumpshow in its last act  you are failing pa sir
Compare Sen. Toomey's answers to the paper mache head's at the #swampcaucus bbq & TH #july4th
Another press event from a man who cld only find 8 supporters in #PA to attend his #FakeTownHall. #PhoneyToomey
Can't wait to hear that you've given up on the cruel @GOP health care bill and will be fixing the ACA.
Maybe take a break from TV.  Talk to the people in PA about your bill and ask what they think.  It's kinda your job. Hint: no one likes it.
Thanks but No thanks Pat.

I had an idea. How about @SenToomey hires a marionette, provides questions to ask him, and pretends to have a town hall?  Oh yea, did that!
Pat as far as medical conditions are concerned, you are infected with political hubris.
No one cares Pat
GOP Republicans hate poor people & elderly. See Paul Ryan mocking a senior citizen that wants to keep his Medicare
All Ur VOICEMAIL BOXES ARE FULL! It was so embarrassing to see you neglect and ignore the outcry against the disasterous healthcare bill.
Not surprising @GOP hanging Jr mbr out 2 spin most unpopular legis. in 30 yrs.  Perhaps u can discuss underside of buses w/ @stevenmnuchin1
Pats constituents waiting for their town hall? Why do you hide from us?
Senator Toomey, why are you doing media but not ONE open town hall? And why are you defending such an awful bill?
They allow him to lie unchecked. Plain & simple. They don't fact check his talking points.
Mitch McConnell has already called healthcare plan dead. Try something new rather than trying to force the country backward.
See video of sociopath Paul Ryan lie about Medicare and laugh about kicking poor people off of Medicaid. GOP is EVIL
I could appear for you at this point "My plan to cut Medicaid doesn't cut Medicaid; it just gives less money so states have to cut it"
The National Rural Hospital Association has concluded that the bill would lead to nearly 700 rural hospitals ceasing operations.

The NY Times caught Toomey lying to the public about the effect your atrocity TrumpCare will have on Medicaid.
Yo, why all the media appearances and no town hall?
I'm pat toomey and I'll  bee  on CNBC! I'm also a  ghoul  who wants to convert disabled  children  into tax cuts  
You are depriving millions of people healthcare coverage so your billionaire SuperPac donors can get tax cuts. You are self-serving
You sure talk a lot. How about doing it in a large room with constituents?
Meet your constituents

Saw u on MJ thanks for clarification on Healthcare, but vote no! Your going to hurt poor!

Massive damage to the opioids crisis cannot be resolved in Trumpcare. https://twitter.com/dr_tef/status/877168265155534848 …
Let me guess, Pat. You think it's a great idea to rip insurance from 22 million to fund a tax cut for the wealthiest.
You should try having a town hall sometime instead.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

Q: Did any Trump campaign member have contact with the Russians?…
What you said about AHCA Medicaid funding and its impact on people and hospitals is wrong and misleading.
I am so disappointed in you. You refuse to see the hardship your bill will create.
Again. Please answer why you refuse to hold live #TownHall sessions with your constituents? Simple question
What is your view on police killing unarmed black people? I'll wait.
Will you be talking about how you plan to take Healthcare from the poor to give Ur rich pals a tax cut- or just lie as usual? #GoldStarDad
Eff off.
U owe it to ur constituents to allows us to have face to face meetings with you. Do u think u r better than us?
#CleanRepeal
Social security is not a gift from the government!!!!!
Pathetic Never Trumper
Tell them you'll vote no.
Stop being a coward and have in person Town hall meetings!
Stay tuned for #ToomeyTheTool as he attempts to steal our health insurance.
