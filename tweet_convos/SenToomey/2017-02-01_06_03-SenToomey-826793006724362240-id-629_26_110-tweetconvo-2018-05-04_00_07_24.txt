#BlackHistoryMonth  #toomeydoesntcareabouttheblackpa
you voted for a racist today. Shame on you. PA will not forget
hypocrite, you so call honor #BlackHistoryMonth but silence Coretta King! #LetCorettaSpeak #letlizspeak
I will be donating $$$ next election your seat is open, if you vote no on Devos it goes to you, if not your opponent
I have family in PA who will vote you out if you don't vote NO ON DEVOS. Your job is at stake.
#MarianAnderson sang at the Lincoln Memorial after being refused at Constitution Hall due to segregation. #BlackHistoryMonth
also during Black History month, you voted to silence Coretta Scott King's words and voted for racist Sessions to be AG. #shame
This is a joke given your censorship of the patriotic words of C.S.K. and choice to support Jim Crow justice in the AG's chair.
.@SenToomey You write fondly about Black History Month AND voted for Sessions?  You are a HUGE HYPOCRITE. UNAMERICAN and a COWARD.
freedom did not ring in the Senate--- no Coretta Scott King readings on sessions! Shameful. Vote no 18324
Want to honor #BlackHistoryMonth #LetLizSpeak @SenateMajLdr cancelled the right to debate in Congress. "You Lie" wasn't cancelled
let freedom ring 4 all white Christian men, right Pat?M Anderson wldnt give u time of day 4 silencing E Warren n voting 4 DeVos.
a song that children will not know how to sing or read because you couldn't vote No on DeVos #NoonDeVos

A sad day is when the words of Martin L King Jr.’s widow are not allowed on the floor of the US Senate. Let Liz Warren speak!
#BlackHistoryMonth
- Did you vote to silence Mrs. King's words?  That is also Black History.
#stopsessions You silence the reading of Dr. Kings wife and bring shame to PA....Redeem yourself, vote no on Sessions
How can you support Trump's disregard for our constitution?
I'm so relieved you tweeted this, we all thought you forgot Philly was part of PA! Hold a town hall with us, please :)
Senator, you know the Commonwealth is not for Ms. DeVos. We need somebody there with legitimate experience. I beg you to vote NO.
he doesn't care.  He just got re-elected and plans to ignore his constituency like he did before.
And for Black History Month you thought it would be wise to confirm a racist as AG.  You are a hypocrite.
Philadelphia is ashamed of you.

RT Mrs. King letter 
Does your black history NOT include Jeff Sessions racist behavior? #shameful #ShePersisted
in honor of black history month and civil rights, VOTE NO for Jeff Sessions as Attourney General! #NOJeffSessionsAG
In honor of #BlackHistoryMonth it's time you speak out against the racist "law and order" EOs that were just signed.
how about you really honor #BlackHistoryMonth and #LetLizSpeak? Better yet, vote #NoSessions for AG
And in honor of black history month you voted "yes" for Sessions. Your sincerity is suspect
If you claim to honor Black History Month then you should vote against the nomination of racist Jeff Sessions for AG!
I'm a constituent imploring you 2 stand up 4 our kids. Pls VOTE NO on DeVos. We need a competent, informed, ethical Sec of Ed.
Also a constituent, and asking for the same. DeVos is unacceptable. Period. Make us proud, Toomey.
I am also a constituent. I agree DeVos is unqualified. Our kids deserve better.
add me to the list, vote NO on Devos!  @noondevos
Vote NO on DeVos! Please!
I'm guessing that by now you all know Toomey voted "YES" for DeVos
you can honor #BlackHistoryMonth but not read this letter?

Go ahead, play your Philadelphia love tweet, #traitor. Todays votes throwing #Philly schools into even more of a tailspin. #DeVos
don't tweet about Black History month when you support a racist "president".
Freedom won't ring until you are GONE. 6 more years--- counting down.
hey toomey way to represent the people ! You do realize you work for us don't you ? It seems you have forgotten
too bad the new uneducated dimwit DeVos wont celebrate black history month now that you took her bribe #KOCHSUCKER! @MsMcFarland
#VoteNoDevos
If u wanna honor #blackhistorymonth do it by helping philly schools. U can start with a #NoonDeVos
Teachers must be trained & qualified. The SecOfEd should be 2. DeVos is unqualified. US kids deserve better. #NoOnDevos
Marian Anderson went to public school in philly & was too poor to go to h.s. Honor her by voting against unqualified @BetsyDeVos!
how about in honor of Black History Month, you could support public education and vote NO on DeVos.
so since you're honoring #BHM and all guess you'll vote no on racist Sessions and unfit DeVos. No to #SwampCabinet #NotoDeVos
The height of hypocrisy...saying you honor black history month after voting for a white supremacist to destroy our country.
So glad to see you honoring African American history! Can you honestly say that Betsy DeVos will serve all Americans equally?
in honor of Black History Month let's continue fighting for Education equality. We can start by finding a qualified Sec of Ed.
Sir, Please Vote for DeVos, I know you are being blasted by Union and teachers, hang tough for parents and children.
We need a nominee that wants to improve the neighborhood schools for all children that want to attend.  No on DeVos!
No No No  We know this is how the party fell in line with Trump. Donors with appointments. Stop this insanity
Vote no on Devos, be the independent republican you said you were instead of a handout taking republican that this country hates.
If I'm a paid protester where is my check?? You have just insulted every one of your constituents by accusing them of fraud!
VOTE NO ON DEVOS!  You work for us, not for yourself or your campaign contributions!
Do you see the writing on the wall? If you care about your future in politics you need to care about our children. Vote NO Devos
As a resident of PA, a student in PA, a parent of students in PA, and teacher in PA...I beg you to vote NO for Devos. Unqualified
Nice of u 2 mention #MarianAnderson. She went to #phillypublicschools that had funding, the opposite of what #DeVos will provide.
also, answer your phone
In honor of black history month, vote for policy that doesn't actively and shamelessly undermine the well being of black folks
As one of your constituents I am imploring you to vote against Betsy Devos on Monday- she is unqualified!!
Another constituent asking you to vote "NO" on Betsy Devos. You could not say more personal about BHM than and old video
Sir, make history by not voting for Devos. Ms. Anderson would turn over in her grave to see you use her name but not your vote.
In honor of black history month help minority children by voting to #stopDeVos whose ideas will hurt them disproportionately more
in honor of #BlackHistoryMonth please reject racist @SenatorSessions as AG.
In honor of #BlackHistoryMonth please speak out against white supremacist #Bannon joining the NSC
