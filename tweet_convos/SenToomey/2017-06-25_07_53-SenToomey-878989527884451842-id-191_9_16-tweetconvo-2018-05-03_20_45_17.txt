Why did U LIE on CBS? States will be able to opt out of continuing the ACA Medicaid expansions, esp if they can't absorb the cost
Make sure you talk about how tax cuts for your rich donors are more important than healthcare for working the class. #ToomeyTheTool
You will be gone soon. Another better option for Senator awaits. And the standards won't have to be that high to replace you.
Lets be honest... The only supporters of the ACHA are the 1%...and they fund the PACs........... Sincerely Lancaster R
Go tell more delusional tales. You don't care about the people. You care about the $ that will line your friends pockets. #ADAPTandRESIST
You are just a rich man looking for tax breaks for your friends. You aligned yourself with people who don't care about lives of others.
Can Toomey be recalled?  Let's do it PA!
Too bad u can't face your constituents & hold a Town Hall. Your bill is a embarrassing shame. You're classism, racism & sexism is showing.
You have no desire to actually fix what's wrong with our current healthcare system. You want to take advantage of the sick, elderly and poor
Where are the tweets supporting your position?
Are they hiding like you?
Talked on a TV screen  but not in person. FACE US TAXPAYERS IN PA
Not good,need to make more changes. Many will die. Is that what you want? What about Chip program?
A lot of people are discussing your lies. It's not passing the smell test.
You ARE alive!!!
#FullRepeal
Why don't I see @SenToomey on @maddow @MSNBC ? Too a shame to face the left?
Americans will die when Toomey gets his way. Republicans will kill anyone for just one more dollar in their pockets.
Watching you now. Please stop lying. Medicaid recipients will suffer. Why is the GOP so insistent on giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy?
Because that is all they have ever cared about.
Pennsylvanian's of both parties know this bill is a disaster. You are there to represent us.  Check your phone and email!
A chance for you to spew bigotry, hatred, and lies.  You will be responsible for more American suffering and deaths than any terror group.
Liar. @SenToomey @FaceTheNation @jdickerson
This bill is a crime against humanity. If you want to be associated with that, it tells your constituents what you think of us.
Do you care about the disabled or are you one who likes to pick them up and move them out of the way so you can pretend they don't exist?
Toomey is enthusiastic about explaining his heartbreaking cuts to Medicaid to the cameras. How about to Pennsylvanians?
He is afraid to talk to Pgh & Philly....he only wants a "safe space" where no one will challenge his BS #TrumpCare #ToomeyCare
To be fair, Toomey is afraid to talk to ANY Pennsylvanians in groups larger than six. He hasn't held town hall anywhere since 2015
PA should be paying attention. Ignores voters and stays in D.C. rarely hometown office.

Pat: I support this bill due to the vast amount of money spent on my campaign, my ultra rich donors, and the 6 years remaining in my term.
VOTE NO
Are you voting to commit genocide on Americans? Vote NO on health bill. Or sell your soul to the devil.
Last I checked discussion didn't involve blatant lying. You should be ashamed.
Toomey seemed so nice and caring in his campaign adds on Philly TV.  Little did we know HE IS A BAD LIAR
Toomey you are a chicken. We should've sent Katie instead of you. #rubberstamp
And Toomey LIED.
When do you plan on listening to what your constituents who you supposedly represent think about this healthcare bill?. #garbage #startover
You make me want to vomit, but I'm concerned it wouldn't be covered by your bullshit plan.

Who opposes the Senate GOP's "healthcare" bill? It's a long list.

There are doctors, hospitals, patients, medical provid…

Hot off the press! The Senate Health Reform Bill Slashes #Medicaid Severely. See new PPI blog: http://bit.ly/2sz08fh  
Vote "NO". 19014
Kill the bill, Senator! Vote no!
Will you get to keep your insurance WHEN you lose your seat in 2018?
How about "Live at a town hall in Pennsylvania," would be appropriate to meet with your constituents.
I missed it did you come up with a good reason to let millions suffer and/or because they don't have access to healthcare anymore
Do you think we don't know how to google or read?  Please stop lying about what this bill does to Medicaid.
Shame on you Sen Toomey. 2022 can't come soon enough. This bill will hurt so many Americans including my daughter.
VOTE NO!
READ THE BILL. Medicaid to be cut by $800 billion. Tens of thousands of PA residents will die!!
Liar
Why are you lying? You know full well that this bill will gut Medicaid & hurt millions.
Pennsylvania is watching you. Have another job lined up in 2022,  you're gone. Your constituents will die, all you care about is the 1%.
Can you tell me what it's like to be a terrible human being?
There are lies, and then there are murderous lies. Your soul is hell-bound.
Live on @FaceTheNation this morning: Joining @Jdickerson to discuss the Senate's health care draft bill.
Why do you want to punish poor people?
You are a liar.
No one loses coverage?!? You lying weasel! Pregnant? Diabetic? Yearly caps? Lifetime caps? You are a murderer 
Why did you lie and say #trumpcare doesn't cut Medicaid?
Tell us what this does to drove down premiums?   This will do nothing but hurt your most vulnurable constituents; how do you sleep at night?
Did you actually say GOP healthcare bill "will codify and make permanent the Medicaid expansion?"  Shameless
Why are you lying?  You are doing just that, just the timeline is different. Have you no decency?
Toomey's American ShamCare Act.
Discuss? You mean lie through your teeth

Every mid. class Penn family with a loved one neglected in or unable to get into LTC can blame you
DON'T CUT THE INCOME STREAM FROM TAXES AND FIX, NOT REPEAL.
Again- explain WHY it is necessary to cut taxes on the wealthiest to cut healthcare to the poor? The question US NOT being answered.

777,000 Pennsylvanians will lose health coverage w/TrumpCare. Pick ALMOST ANY COUNTY in Penn. ALL in  county WILL LOSE coverage. Vote NO!
Sen Toomey, please stay off the Sunday shows.  You are an embarrassment to PA.
Sure it's safe behind a camera but you won't face your constituents!
You lied throughout the whole thing. You should be ashamed of yourself. #Liar
well apparently discuss meant blatantly lie because you know the truth of your bill hurting the poor to help the rich is shameful
How about a town hall? Or hearings? You can't use people hating the #ACA as an excuse when this many people are upset and scared by #AHCA
C'mon Toomey - I know it's hard to go against your peers, but your people need you to do what's best for them!
What, what? Senator you just flat out lied to AMERICA! Do you take us for fools? You will GUT over 24% of 70 million Americans w/o Medicaid
You to lie about your health don't care bill.
You were awful! It was like Trump  gave you some of his KoolAid prior to the program. Thought you were different!!!!
Ha!   You dont even face your own constituency....
#FullRepeal this current bill is as bad as Obamacare and you know it !
You're a bum.
He's a total shit weasel.
How does it feel knowing Pennsylvanian's will vote you out in 2018. #NextYear #MidTerms #TownHall #AmericaSpeaksOut
So your constituents need to watch you on national tv instead of you holding a town hall and answering the tough questions!
You are a LIAR. We can read Senator. We will not forget that you vote to  to kill people so you can give tax breaks to your wealthy donors!
@GOP Pro life party for excluding pregnancy coverage- Hypocrites!!
Payoffs and tax breaks are more imoirtsmt to you than our lives. You are a cruel man. #AHCAKills #AHCAisIMMORAL #WhatWouldJesusDo

I've given up playing the compassion card since you clearly have none
I attempted to write to him to plead with him to vote no on the horrible "healthcare" bill.
So, I engaged in an act of futility with the senator's email service.
Oh, so now it's a draft bill? When can we expect open debate&hearings so ppl's healthcare isnt gutted but protected? #TrumpCareCutsMedicaid
Here is the link for this info: https://maplight.org/story/senators-drafting-secret-health-care-bill-backed-by-insurance-and-pharma-campaign-money/ … || @SenToomey please support PA residents and not your big $$ donors
Even @AHIPCoverage was opposed to the house bill. Every major provider and hospital advocacy group has come out against #BCRA.
How can you live with yourself? You rich, elite Repubs are traitors
U lied 50 million ppl will be negatively impacted by this bill. State opt out and federal dollars will be less to fund it.
Senator Pat Toomey has decided to LIE to the people of Pennsylvania.

When are you going to be live in PA? You are a weasel who won't meet with us because you know you are a cruel, mean person.
You lied to the American people today. History will remember your stance on this bill. You have shamed yourself and your family name.
You misspelled "mislead"
Doubtful @SenToomey reads Twitter comments - call to be heard +1 (412) 803-3501 #TuesdayswithToomey @PAGOP #HealthcareMatters
@SenToomey seems you may have misread your bill?
Such a good liar Senator. You do it w/such aplomb. I'm sure both your children or your parents are proud of your ability to spew falsehoods.
And we would listen to your lies because...?  We all know you're lining your pockets and sacrificing the ppl. Shameful!
Watch him lie and sell out the American people!
Ugh who cares the bill is trash
How you sleep at night and look your family in the face we'll never know; or are they all blatant liars too?
1st: it's a bill YOU authored.
2nd: now it's a 'draft'. Why is that, Pat? Taking healthcare from sick & disabled for a tax break went bad?
Hope you name all of your corporate sponsors. You sure don't work for your constituents!
I'm so disappointed in you as a pennsylvanian.  How can you, with a straight face, push this murderous bill?
Another chance to portray a turd as useful. How do justify this piece of crap to the millions it hurts?
We will remember.
So you'll "Face the Nation" but not your constituents? #coward #sycophant
This is a horrible bill and you know it! Please vote no.  #wewillnotforget #historyhasitseyesonyou
Maybe you should be honest and admit your plan is a tax cut for your rich friends and that you don't care if people die because of it.
It was so cool watching my Senator blatantly lie on television! Way to be evil!
Tell Claire & Keino (in the wheelchairs) why a tax cut is worth more than their lives. #AHCAisIMMORAL
We invited @SenToomey 2 meet Claire & others at the 24-hr #VigilforOurLives last week, but no show. #SHAME
You misspelled abomination....
Why are you pushing this thing so hard? It's like you have major money riding on it.
You are lying! Hold a town hall and tell us to our faces that tax cuts are more important than our lives.
Don't trust Toomey he lies to his constituents and he lies to the country! He works for the Koch brothers
??? - He's not with fellow Senators Lee, Flake and others at the big Koch Brothers donors private retreat at a luxury resort in the Rockies?
"Will codify Medicaid expansion."This is an outright lie if you read the bill. Do you have any morals left or is lying just the GOP way now?
Good maybe you can explain why you're in favor of a bill that will kill millions! We'd really like to know
It is an awful bill. You represent Pennsylvanians not the Koch brothers, not the 1% .
Koch brothers has a retreat to help sway to make this bill even more conservative. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer
How you can go on national television and lie is truly amazing. You do not cease to boggle the mind
Why can't you be more like our good senator, @SenBobCasey ?
Sum it up in two words. It's mean.
Sounds like you will vote yes. Disappointed :( 
#NoTrumpCare
But no town hall meeting to deal with your constituents. Scared, are we?
Hey dude, just wondering what happened in your past that made you the absolute worst?
To be fair, Mcconnell and Ryan are just as evil. Toomey is definitely catching up though.
Shame on you.
He helped write it. With the help of insurance and big pharma lobbyists. Hey Toomey, we're a purple state and we will remember in 2022
#NOCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …
To sell us more lies, like "medicaid won't be cut"?
I hope you vote no! You know that a lot Pennsyanians are poor!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
@RandPaul suggests you shop around for cheaper health care.  What a bedside manner he must have!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
Do your job, protect the people of PA and the country from this disaster!
Are you going to answer real questions about it, or dodge the insane cruelty of the bill?  #VoteNo
You know that what you said is shit, you know what will happen to Pennsylvanians and you still will vote for the AHCA. Shame on you.
This bill is a disaster for poor, elderly, middle class. Please vote no.
