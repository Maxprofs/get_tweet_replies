@SenJohnMcCain @Crell WTF? Did the account get hacked?
@tjcapture Have a look at the rest of the feed. Looks legit. :-)
@Crell yes, unfortunately.
@tjcapture Why unfortuntely?
@Crell it looks legit, which is unfortunate.
@tjcapture Still don't follow... It's unfortunate that McCain is complaining about lobbyist pork?
@Crell considering his campaign contributors, I don't believe he is really complaining.
Is this real? “@SenJohnMcCain: Congrats to all the special interests on the passage of the #FarmBill today, especially the sugar industry!”
@JesseLaGreca @SenJohnMcCain What? Why "especially the sugar industry"?
If this was in mockery, he's doing it wrong “@dylantucker3000: @JesseLaGreca @SenJohnMcCain What? Why "especially the sugar industry"?”
@SenJohnMcCain @SenToomey, either of you tried to live on food stamps? Watch the @TakePart documentary "A Place At The Table" #EyeOpener
@SenJohnMcCain @lessig MY GOD SENATOR -- do you hear what you're saying?..#Impolitic #FoodIndustrialComplexIsKillingUs
“@SenJohnMcCain: Congrats to all the special interests on the passage of the #FarmBill today, especially the sugar industry!”
.@SenJohnMcCain "Build the dang fence" You have zero credibility. Because of that even if you're right you hurt your cause. Retire.
@Melvin_Udall_ What it's worth, I'm sorry America, he's my Senator.
@GSchneyer Yikes. Yeah. That's awful. I do not get the people of your state.
@Melvin_Udall_ Oh & "I've always been a Yankees fan" Clinton.
@SenJohnMcCain  Globalist Stooge Corporatist..HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NITE ??
@Liberty4UanMe @SenJohnMcCain I think he's being sarcastic the sugar industry is the worst...
@SenJohnMcCain When do the working poor, the unemployed and the middle class become a special interest group to you?
@SenJohnMcCain Andy Kaufman...is that you?
@SenJohnMcCain @NYDanSanchez  McCain cares about big business and corporate interests. McCain met with billionaire Soros his boss other day
@SenJohnMcCain @NYDanSanchez that's why they added snap or food stamp bill to farm bill...to get yall to pass it 4 big corporations
@SenJohnMcCain @lessig And the MOB Bosses at the USDA want to kiss you to.
@SenJohnMcCain @stevej Because we all know John McCain doesn't cotton to lobbyists!
@SenJohnMcCain @lessig subsidizing multi million dollar argri business to insulate from the market is socialism for the rich
@SenJohnMcCain @lessig You got your fruits and veggies, your meat and dairy and breads and you're going to want to put sugar onto everything
@SenJohnMcCain @lessig I think we can agree that the sugar industry won when they got the US to make sugar the topping for the food pyramid.
@SenJohnMcCain @lessig Come on Senator, you give favors to your campaign contributors also. Just ask the Sugar industry to for contributions
@SenJohnMcCain If the Military-Industrial Machine could figure how to make gun powder or napalm out of sugar you'd be their big cheerleader
@SenJohnMcCain Special interests now run most elections because of Citizens United.  Why shouldn't they run legislative affairs too?
@SenJohnMcCain "SPECIAL"  INTERESTS !! SCUM BAG !!
@SenJohnMcCain One of the very few times I have agreed with You.
@SenJohnMcCain is there any pain involved being a turncoat?
I don't know what's crazier? A tweet praising the sugar industry or the insane RW comments made about it @SenJohnMcCain @EspuelasVox
@SenJohnMcCain Retire old man
@senjohnmccain "Congratulations to all the special interests"? You guys are sure out in the open these days. #WeAreDoomed
DEMENTIA !!! “@SenJohnMcCain: Congrats to all the special interests on the passage of the #FarmBill today, especially the sugar industry!”

@SenJohnMcCain @PoliticalLaughs Funny you say something AFTER it passes#Farm bill
@SenJohnMcCain @Pudingtane You have no shame.
@SenJohnMcCain @PoliticalLaughs I think it's sarcasm...
@SenJohnMcCain @PoliticalLaughs Because your RINO ass has NEVER voted in favor of a special interest? You're fucking kidding me, right?
@SenJohnMcCain @PoliticalLaughs Really? Senator Special Interest.
@SenJohnMcCain @PoliticalLaughs mindblowing . you actually step out for a bow on that $trillion pig ? #PosterChildForBrokenWashingtonDC

@SenJohnMcCain @SenToomey And don't forget all those food stamp recipients who got a much bigger increase than the social security folks!
@SenJohnMcCain Mention #minWage4Congress on the floor ==> Watch the fire it lights #bonuses4Accountability Control yourself before we do
@SenJohnMcCain reprehensible.  And it cuts food aid to those who most need it. Don't forget *that*.
For real bro? "@SenJohnMcCain: Congrats to all the special interests on the passage of the #FarmBill today, especially the sugar industry!”
@SenJohnMcCain @Watchdogorg Please tell Mr McCain "congrats" in losing his Senate race
@SenJohnMcCain how much pork is in it
@SenJohnMcCain YOU R PATHETIC. RETIRE. What's so good about 80% of it is welfare/food stamps. Do us a favor.
Farm Bill price supports on sugar continue to force Americans to pay twice what global consumers pay @SenJohnMcCain @Watchdogorg
@SenJohnMcCain Do you mean the Islamists who are getting $ for growing nothing? @Watchdogorg
