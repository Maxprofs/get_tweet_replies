You mean the mothers who will have to go without basic care for themselves and their children under TrumpCare?
Not happy this or any other day as all men decide my health rights.
I think you have to get with the problems of the day
You are complicit in a corrupt and treasonous administration. We the people will mark your place in history, for your grandchildren to read.
I would have given up Mother's Day to attend your Townhall
They would probably enjoy it knowing that they are not punished by you and Premier Trump for being mom's who want he health care.
Happy "let's host a town hall" day!

Pretty hypocritical to tweet this and support cutting their healthcare dontcha think ?
Do you still support repeal of ACA? If so, then don't even try.
How's about you sign a single piece of legislation to prove you care about women. You are a coward.
One of the things I thought about on Mother's Day was whether or not my Medicare health ins. would be pulled out from under me.
It'd be a lot better if you voted no on this thing.
My mom wants you to be a patriot, endorse a special prosecutor and oppose whatever Trump apologist is appointed as new FBI director
Senator, please work to craft healthcare legislation that protects the rights and bodies of women.
I'm a mom, and I'm NOT having a great day. Your thoughts on this news, Senator?
Not the greatest since I am supposed to trust you to not let insurance charge more for pre-existing conditions again. #mychilddeservesbetter
And the moms hope all the GOP senators out there will stop covering for a traitor.
Thanks for voting to make pregnancy a pre-existing condition! #resist
Says they guy who backed the pussy grabber
Sad
Fake news ..u don't care,about women or moms
Probably not considering none of them are going to be able to afford healthcare for themselves or their children soon.
GFY. Your voting record only punishes mothers.
Please honor Mothers Day by ensuring that all mothers have affordable healthcare!
Worrying about daughter with preexisting condition having insurance because my Senator wants to end ACA ruins it. I WILL vote against you.
Happy pre-existing condition day to you too, Senator.
I know for sure that they'd really like to keep their healthcare & not have pregnancy be a preexisting condition!
Please hold some town hall meetings around the state so we can discuss health care and environmental protections.
Speaking of moms, will you promise to support access to prenatal care as you work on the Senate health care bill? #AHCA decimates it!
You are pretty much nothing but a ribbon cutter while Trump works to dismantle our democratic republic. Like what you see in the mirror?
Considering your position on health care for women, this is an absurdly hypocritcal statement for you to make.
You exist, now go away you fraud. You are an embarrassment to our great Commonwealth!
Ha! Strip health care and rights away from women while wishing us a nice day. Senator, we WILL remember. #RESISTANCE
Don't you mean "happy pre-existing condition day" cause that's what mothers are in your eyes
we would if rape, pregnancy, irregular periods, would not be a pre-existing condition. And stop taxing tampons and pads please.

I hope you will help,save  But I will not hold my breathe. 
Can we have affordable maternity care for all women?
you know what I'd love for Mother's Day? For you and the rest of your cronies to stay out of my uterus.
Your votes and supporting policies are RUINING THIS country. Trump is a lying fool. We must have an INDEPENDENT COUNSEL NOW. TRUMP IS LYING!
My Mothers Day was spent w my disabled son in the hospital. He is on Medicaid...the program YOU want to cut by $880 billion.
Town hall.
Please work to make sure all moms have healthcare
Nice pat. Now get to work and challenge trump's outrageous behavior.
Not while the ethicsless Senate is letting the president trash our heritage, no
Lol like you give a shit about women.
How many of them will be kicked off insurance because of pre existing conditions ?
We would have a better one if you left office
Would love to have same health care as our Senators and Representatives!
Since when do you care about women?  You're a Republican and vote only for the party.  Therefore you vote against anything that would help.
My mom told me she wanted a townhall from you for #MothersDay2017
Would be much more enjoyable if motherhood wasn't a preexisting condition.
Be honest, Senator. You really don't care. Especially if they have a pre-existing condition. We want #IndependentInvestigation
It would be a great Mother's Day if the GOP had more interest in saving our democracy than saving their own jobs.
Wow. Your hypocrisy is breathtaking.

Thanks, I have them and use them frequently.
So kind! Keep this in mind when you help to shape Trumpcare
Happy Mother's Day! Trumpcare would gut maternity care and the ban on lifetime limits for NICU babies. Pregnant? +$17k in premiums.
Would make rape, domestic violence, and assault, pregnancy, all pre existing conditions and no group of men should be deciding womans rights
I'll be happy when you start representing me.
I hope all of the moms to be will have health insurance for when they want vitamins or to give birth
It would be a really great Mother's Day if American mothers didn't have to worry about the GOP destroying their healthcare.
Yours may be ashamed of you.
Resign Pat. Happy Mothers Day.
That's funny. It's like you pretend to care about women.
Thanks. Hope us older moms will be able to afford healthcare under Trumpcare
I doubt you have any respect for women at all unless they are spending you money.  Fraud and sellout. #onthetaketoomey
You're trying to make motherhood a pre-existing condition.
The ones who are afraid they're going to lose their health insurance are not, Senator.
As long as you continue to support the decimation of the ACA, you aren't supporting mothers.
Ha great #MothersDay is more difficult if you know that healthcare is being decided by a group of male GOP senators
Since that makes me have a pre-existing condition for which I could have to pay more for my health insurance, it's hard to be too happy.
I would if I didn't have to worry about healthcare for my kids, a loonybird President you blindly follow, & you not listening to us. #Coward
How can we when we are under attack by the @GOP and the @realDonaldTrump
Make Mother's Day great by crafting laws that give moms paid child rearing leave and provide healthcare coverage for preexisting conditions.
They would have an even better Mother's Day if they knew you would protect women's health. #keepACA #NoAHCA
I hope you will call for an independent investigator. It will make a lot of Mom's happy.
You can help this constituents Mothers Day be great by supporting independent invest into Russia ties w/this admin (zip:19406) #TrumpRussia
Not going to be a great day with our health care threatened and our democracy under Russian control, but what do you care?
You know what would allow them to enjoy today more? Paid maternity leave so they didn't have to go to work tomorrow.
My Mothers Day will be happy when I see you choose country over party.
PA mothers like me oppose the anti-family AHCA and expect you to do the same. Vote no, Senator. #NoAHCA #SaveACA
Moms who are uninsurable if they are pregnant or became mothers via c-section. You better fix that if you expect me to believe this tweet.
I would be, if I knew my Senator would actually craft a healthcare bill that prioritized women's health. Ask a woman to help you with AHCA.
I hope all moms have health care and senators who work for country not party
How?  They all have preexisting conditions now.
Happy pre-existing condition day!
All mothers want you to support investigations of Trump's tie to Russia. As a mom, I'm disappointed that you fail to speak out!
Respectfully,Senator Pat Toomey,I hope you are working on getting a special prosecutor.And of course,that you&wife have a Happy Mother's Day
Mothers aren't just baby machines you twit!
Well we'd all have a better one if we knew that our very existence wasn't considered a preexisting condition! #MothersDay #WomenMatter
they would if you would do your job and appoint an independent nonpartisan prosecutor to investigate tRump/Russia. This is bigger than party
Say it to my face.
Better late, than never. Day almost over, dumb s**t!
Trumpcare, Russiagate, Tax reform, you serve at the pleasure of Pennsylvania. Not Gop.
Once you stop hijacking our healthcare try creating a single payer system
They'd be feeling a lot better if you weren't trying to take away their basic healthcare and protective rights!
I hope you start doing your job. Appoint a special prosecutor
No I'm not because you are complicit in the destruction of America.
I would have a better day knowing I could count on having healthcare in my future.
Does it bother you that you don't even get likes on a mom's day post? Congrats. You are officially less popular than genital warts.
I doubt your sincerity based on your voting record
They would have a much better day if you would stand up for their healthcare and say no to Trump every once in a while.

Too bad being a mother and getting pregnant  is now a preexisting condition
Best present affordable health care covering contraceptives and maternity care, 2nd paid maternity leave like 41 other countries
If you mean this then ask women to take part in drafting healthcare AND impeach tRump we don't want Russian agents in the White House
It'd be a hell of a lot better if we had TOWN HALLS with you on our agendas. Your days are numbered, because we don't forget or forgive

15220.
Does your mother know that you want to take healthcare away from millions of PA children? Bring her to a town hall & we will discuss.
Would be better if you supported a special prosecutor for the #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
