You're really all in on this horrific reform idea that was crafted by old white men (see mirror) behind closed doors in a week...sad.
PLEASE VOTE NO ON TRUMPCARE! We need to fix ACA!!
Not for the elderly.  The Per capita cap growth rate will cost the average nursing home $600k/yr + $100k from the provider assessment cut.
The GOP health bill DOES NOT preserve Medicaid.
try full time bee keeping. The bees won't have to listen to your BS.

Agreed! The present bill is a travesty for the American people who give Congress great health care! Move all Congress to Medicaid! Fix it!
Such as
Senate bill, Medicaid expansion to be rolled back over the next 6 years. By 2020, no new enrollees will be able to join under expansion
Medicaid cuts remain.
The BCRA doesn't save medicaid, since it to cuts funding without cutting the costs of medical procedures or nursing home care.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. you sir are lying.
oh and one more thing #MODESTMY@$$
Why does this include a tax cut to the rich? You are shameful.
Can you engage in an intellectually honest capacity with your constituents on this issue at one time please? http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/study-obamacare-not-collapsing-n781486?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma …
Does an insurance exec really need to make 30 mil while screwing those he insures by not providing affordable coverage if they are sick?
Great comment! But of course that CEO is keeping Toomey's political aspirations alive with donations!
If Congress would keep their greedy fingers out of the surplus funds for both Medicaid and Social Security the money would be there!
Fix it, but don't burn people in the process! Do Medicaid and the ACA in separate efforts!
What about the cuts to Planed Parenthood? Nice job by you and 12 other old white guys
I don't consider modest changes ...22 million go without insurance coverage.  Guess it is your perspective from the pinnacle of wealth
#savemedicaid #savelives #voteno #donoharm
We don't matter . Do you really think we are that stupid?
'No, it doesn't' says insurance, hospitals, healthcare economists, doctors and other people who are actually healthcare experts.
Math=Taxes for the one percent will cover Medicare won't it?
Look at CMS actuary report.  They predict growth for aged, blind and disabled at 5.7% through scoring window!  You want CPIU for all?
Here's the @GOP "math".
20 percent of Americans are covered by Medicaid. If funding gets cut, states will tighten eligibility requirements or limit medical service
#VoteNoBCRA
Just because you say it's so, doesn't make it true. Lots of experts say you are dead wrong on Medicaid caps.
Its  always a crisis. The politics makes me sick. Not sicker than paying the 3.8%
How about figuring out why healthcare costs so much in US and why it's ranked so horribly #singlepayernow @AdamBercosky
Funny how 50% of Medicare survey respondents gave medicare a PERFECT rating... Yet you keep trying to destroy it. Why? Who is paying you?
Senator Toomey must have a different definition of the word "modest." How can you see an $800B Medicaid cut as anything but catastrophic?
I work for people with ALS. 1/3 of our patients rely on Medicaid. Cuts or caps would devastate families who need it.
Great to hear you're helping ALS patients. I volunteer RN hours when I can. Lost my oldest bro to ALS on 9/14/13.
My grandfather passed away from ALS ten years ago. Now I work for @ALSphiladelphia It's great to provide some assistance.
Sorry for your loss. It's the cruelest disease. Be well
https://twitter.com/sentoomey/status/884443233086050308 … Instead of spending trillions, why not go to universal healthcare? Oh, forgot, then no tax break to wealthy.
When reforming Medicaid, we must also preserve care. W/modest changes, we can. My @USATODAY op-ed w/Larry Lindsey: https://usat.ly/2tGzAHS 
https://twitter.com/sentoomey/status/884443233086050308 … Why didn't you work with Obama back then if his idea is so good today?  Meet with PA voters to see how. #coward
When reforming Medicaid, we must also preserve care. W/modest changes, we can. My @USATODAY op-ed w/Larry Lindsey: https://usat.ly/2tGzAHS 
You are robbing from the poor to pay the rich. That's your math. You have no shame.
What? Do all of you Repub enemies of the people get handed a little policy tweak to "reveal" to us as the reason we should re-elect you. BS!
Health care costs need changes. Not paying doesn't make the need go away it, means people won't get that care. People with no other option
You are robbing the poor to enrich the rich.  Medicaid for all is what we need.  We need a #Singlepayer system.
Toomey says "Listen  We can get rid of nursing home care and do the disabled really need care?"
Toomey says "Listen, I know that my GOVT CARE will never be cut, But we really need 2 cut Medicaid by Billions"
Like not giving a taxcut focused on millionaires, or holding hearings to find bipartisan ideas...why is that so hard for you now.
Does it have an age tax in your new bill.
Medicaid provided me with free birth control, as a homeless teen, so I didn't have a kid I couldn't afford. Medicaid is essential.
I can't wait to vote you out. #ToomeyMustGo
not
"Modest changes" lmao get the hell out.
This is patently false. CBO predicts 20mil+ w/o covg + 10s of thousands dead. Esp marginalized ppl #OpposeBCRA #TrumpcareKills  15126
Only the rich will benefit from this if you take all the money you want to give them it could fund Medicaid, medicare, and SS so SAD it wont
More lies. Most of the savings in the Senate health care bill come from deep cuts  to Medicaid. http://bit.ly/2sJqfOk  #TrumpcareKills

Insurance costs would be lower if hospitals charged less. Does the plan include any means to control that side of things?
That sounds fine as a stated aim, but your bill does not do that
Capping individual limits so you can give tax cuts undermined your credibility
caps are "modest changes"??  We know the truth about this bill. #savemedicaid
How many people will lose coverage under your "modest" proposal?  You are deliberately playing with words.  This bill will hurt people!!
LIE
Hiw much modest goes to your bottom line, or your pockets? How much has hc kicked to you to write on this "legislation."
Says the guy who has free tax payer funded healthcare. How do you sleep at night?
How are you addressing provider pricing in managing costs.
You need to look up the definition of modest. You bought and paid for mouthpiece.
FACT. The only way to fix healthcare is  a bipartisan bill.
We get the hell to work then....u are a public servant....i wish i could rip you a new one tomorrow on Gunther Walsh show..i hope he does!
Start by not increasing tax breaks for the wealthiest!!
Could you really look into the eyes of those who will be impacted by the GOP Bill
By slamming Medicaid, you are taking money from the poor, sick and elderly in order to give tax cuts to the rich. SHAME!
Toomey wants #WEALTHCARE to give tax cuts to rich. You should act on behalf of all Americans and quit doing the bidding of the Koch bro.
That atrocity on the public will requir more than modest changes.
Cutting costs by providing LESS CARE is a step BACKWARDS for my practice, my patients, our state, and the US. You were not elected for this!
More Toomey BS! Medicare for all Americans now.
It's really easy to reduce one's food budget too -- if you eat only 2 meals a day instead of 3. You call that a useful cost-cutting measure?
More half truths that obscure the whole picture. So Cynical!  You know you must resort to cunning & trickery
Is there a reason R's were scared shitless to hold townhalls during July 4th to defend TrumpCare?   A realization of how toxic it is?
Make it a joint US-USSR project with Russia in charge of all our medical systems.
Did you make sure to take care of the oppressed billionaire class and their need for tax cuts?
You've missed it.  Looking at the future of career changing events, portability of benefits are essential.  This includes healthcare. Do it.
With portability, wage stagnation might lift. Workers prisoners to employer health ins for years now. Cut us loose!
Always remember: on the issue of healthcare, you are on the same side as the guy who is trying to sell our country to the Russians.
Vote no! Fix the ACA! #ToomeysLastTerm
We are not buying your repeated attempts to distort the facts around Wealthcare. If enacted, it will devastate your constituents #VoteNoBCRA
Interesting idea... From a man who has no credibility... You're a snake in the grass.  #TrumpcareKills
Op-ed is an opinion.  We know your opinion about lives and Tax cuts for the rich and your new math.  #VOTENO BHCA BILL. ZIP 19454
@SenToomey NO.  We do not want this.  NO NO NO 18054
Why start with the least .. 

Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me
I love this verse. Thank you.
Get to 50 and kiss your seat good bye!
ALL GOP ARE NOTHING BUT ASS KISSERS
@ASlavitt how can they run your article and this drivel too?

It's all lies!!! Sacrificing the poor for the rich! #TaxCut in disguise! We need EVERYONE in the market for costs to drop! Keep mandates.
Give me a break .... you're fine to throw the elderly out on the street so the Koch Brothers can get a big tax cut; you will answer to God.
How much did u take from the insurance companies I think Mitch got over 400,000 ur name was on that list
This doesn't look like preserving to me Senator
Senator, you must go beyond an academic understanding of the issues! People are not numbers. Your article has statistics but not humanity.
People want to go forward. We have the wealth to take care of everyone. Stop lying. Do your job.  VOTE NO on #Wealthcare
Worse wealth inequality in American since the Great Depression. 50% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. And your idea is go backwards?
The current healthcare proposal is morally corrupt. Do your part to reject it. A bi-partisan approach on a new proposal will be good.
We get it - the Koch Brothers want to curb spending so they won't ever be taxed more, but how is path of inequality sustainable?
Quit with the nonsense that helping our citizens is unsustainable. It's   not. Tons of countries have figured out how to provide care to all
Just a reminder, Senator - MILLIONS of Americans are counting on YOU to make their lives better, not worse. VOTE NO on #Wealthcare
I can't wait for your term to be up.  You're a disaster.
There is nothing "modest" about the changes. People die = more money in your pocket.
I'm a Medicaid suicide attempt survivor. Now I'm an advocate and lobby with people like you and fight for people like me
You're fascinated in talking to everyone except your constituents about this. If it was so great, you'd think you tell voters directly.
You were elected to repeal Obamacare and now you lied to us. Just admit it so we can make sure you are defeated at the ballot box.
Those qualified to be on Medicaid before Obamacare aren't touched, including women, children and elderly.
Why are you asking me to pay for your state's expansion to cover a bunch of welfare mooches that are refusing to  get a job? Socialist much?
At this point you're the personification of the word disingenuous. You don't want to preserve care. You want to preserve power and wealth.
It'll kill millions that's how! It's easy to say your reducing Medicaid and lowering taxes! But killing millions to do it is hitler like
On what I'm sure is a completely unrelated note, is your office still telling constituents you haven't decided how you'll vote on the #BCRA?
ROFL
PAT TOOMEY is a bigger threat to AMERICANS HEALTH AND SAFETY THAN ISIS AND THE TALIBAN COMBINED
Pat believes FAKE NEWS. How can anyone take you seriously? You fight @GOP and @realDonaldTrump more then Dems.  VOTE OUT this SAD RINO
Is this Koch approved?
BCRA doesn't fix underlying issues that make Medicaid unsustainable. Shame on you for oversimplifying & distorting a vital, complex subject
This is a CUT to Medicaid and changes aren't modest. You cut who is eligible, for tax cut for your Koch brother donors
Please help me understand why a tax break for the wealthy at the expense of the poor is better for America?
YOU ARE A DEM! Obamacare lover & Entitlements w/ NOT get you reelected! Never @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP 'ers will be gone in PRIMARIES
http://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/deaths-health-care-bill/?platform=hootsuite … With due respect, you sir are a #liar #AHCA
With care does not include legislation written in a dark closet by 13 men with NO healthcare experience
Modest changes? Is that a euphemism for tax break again? Yeah, you're 'preserving it' by transferring it to the state, who you've hobbled.1/
& considering we live in a regressively taxed state in comparison to the average, we'll be even worse off than most states. 2/2
Nope. Tax cuts for the wealthy. This Is a GOP death bill to persons with preexisting conditions, as premiums will be unaffordable. #immoral
No one disputes the math, they dispute your solution. Your solution is to allow people to suffer and die. That’s immoral.
Senator Toomey I suppose this bill. Please vote no. Thank you. 19462
Again, when is your public #TownHall? You will not be the hero, you will be a villain, always. #coward #sycophant #SaveourCare #SaveACA
preservation is not the goal. It needs to work for the people. TrumpCare makes it work for the 1% that want a tax cut by starving it.
I admire your commitment to the lies. Vote No. It's a horrible bill that no one approves of. Listen to us, seriously.
Outside of GOP hatred for everything Obama did, why repeal when you clearly can't replace? Yr HC bill is a loser, makes the ACA look good.
You keep saying "preserve existing care" but offer no concrete plan for doing so. Giving states flexibility lets them reduce/end benefits.
Yes, a "Modest Proposal" came to mind when I heard about your bill.
I think that your sub-conscience is showing..
#ModestProposal #ACHA #ACA
If you are not familiar with it, you can read about "A Modest Proposal" by Jonathan Swift here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal …
A very fitting parallel to the Republican Health Care/Tax Break Bill...
Does your plan lower the cost of healthcare and drugs? How much have insurers and pharma contributed to your campaigns?  Own stock in them?
It's not true and the people of PA will suffer so you can give tax cuts to the rich. Please stop pushing this toxic bill.
Your 'Math' op-ed left out why Medical Costs are so much more than an other country in the world..GREED. No mention of the TRUE Cost driver
PER CAPITA CAPS, CUTS, BLOCK GRANTS, etc are NOT MODEST CHANGES! They prevent disabled kids from getting their needs met
Go back to school. Learn real math not the math of voodoo economics.
IT WON"T BE AVAILABLE FOR *CURRENT* GENERATIONS IF YOU DON'T LEAVE IT ALONE! Stop twisting language and treating people like idiots
Please see @ASlavitt for refutation of this ridiculous article
Doesn't get beyond second paragraph before it falls apart, capping at arbitrary growth and limiting future enrollment cuts care. Period.
You just keep tweeting lies to justify your ignorance. We hate you!
We don't care about op-eds, Pat. The fact is that you're trying to cram a tax cut for the wealthy down our throats and we don't want it.
And make sure the wealthy DO NOT get a massive tax cut. They're not the class that needs help. The poor, working poor, & working class are.
Reform means to improve. Your plan only increases the amount of cash going to the top. It doesn't improves lives, or protect the vulnerable
Most ain't good enough.  And the rest of your statement is probably untrue.
would you PLEASE stop referring to your  #wealthcare  tax cut as healthcare/Medicaid reform? We aren't stupid.
Nice try, but we all read the CBO report.
Dear God Pat, you must really, really owe the Koch's to be out on this tour of BS & lies..  #TrumpCare #ToomeyCare
Simple math....if demand for services increase so does the amount needed to fund them. Not keeping up with demand for funds is a CUT.
Come 2018.. the GOP can never again campaign that they will repeal ObamaCare.  We now know that is a lie.
So instead of giving the wealthy tax cuts of $1 TRILLION give them tax cuts of $1. How's that for a modest change?
You're really all in on this. I'm not sure why reducing healthcare access  to the needy is your core value. Might want to get that checked!
You're an immoral liar who'll be responsible for more American suffering and deaths than any terror group.  We can see and hear you, Pat.
How about doing your job, meeting with the people you're supposed to represent not writing fluff opinion pieces to make yourself feel better
Your healthcare opinions are colored by the fat checks you receive from insurance & pharma companies. You are worthless on this topic.
When did it become about reforming medicaid? It was about lowering premiums and replacing Obamacare with something better. This does neither
I agree Medicaid spending must be slowed & managed but not by simply dumping the problem on the States +
you must first invest in real reform & process improvement for the root problem (the costs of medical care), +
you can't fix Medicaid or insurance premiums without first fixing the underlying costs of medical care
You're smoking some good shit senator.
Just like your "townhall" you had? Also a lie
Republican Sen. Pat Toomey on health care: "We're hearing very vocal protest from people who don't like the direction we're heading in." 
It's insulting and disgusting that you would try to sell this as "oh we're actually HELPING poor people." Give me a break just like the 1% 
So you are writing a new bill?
Senator Toomey, as a Pennsylvanian I say to you: GIVE IT UP...YOU HAVE EMBARRASSED US ENOUGH!
This is disingenuous- only shows percentage of federal budget.
I am still waiting for an answer. Why not fix the healthcare we have? Do rich people really need a tax break?
You talk about care? What do you care about? MONEY, STATUS ? You sure as shit don't care about humanity. Have a real discussion. Call me! 
@JoeNBC Watching your explanation on @Morning_Joe for targeting Medicaid and not Medicare was embarrassing. Poor people don't have a PAC.

Is there a way the average voter can ask and get an answer. Without filters. one on one?????.
Like you actually give a flying fuck what Pres. Clinton said about #Medicaid in 1994. Give us a goddam break.
As @JoeNBC asked you directly this morning, why start with the poor?
Because he doesn't care if you don't have enough money to survive let alone have health care
Wait a minute, we NEED a HUGE TAX CUT cuz we've spent so much money rigging the 2016 elections and trash-talking climate change!
