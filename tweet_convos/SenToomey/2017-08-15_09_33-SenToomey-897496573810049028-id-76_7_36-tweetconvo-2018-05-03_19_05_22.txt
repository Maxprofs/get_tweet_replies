Vote against Mandel. He is racist and not qualified.
Does Upper Darby even know who you are? You never show your face around here. It's August 15th. You promised town halls in August.
He couldn't find Upper Darby on a map. That's how Awful he is.
You embarrass Pennsylvania. Please resign
Need a Senator to NOT represent you? Call Pat-I work for big $$$-ToMe #KochSucker
Hold up, you actually went to Upper Darby to help them? You could see the Philly skyline from the firehouse. Weren't you scared?
We'd devour him in Philly! He'll never come, a coward!
That's nice. But what are you saying about @POTUS and his outrageous, agregious, and offensive statements?
Selective  good  deeds isn't going to make me forget I am a burned out  shell and you worked on a horrid healthcare plan behind closed doors
Do you agree with Trump that Nazis and Klansmen are "nice people"?  Pick a side.
Really, Come out from under the rock!  Do you have any idea what is going on in the world? US? PA? how about rt. 81? You are clueless SHAME!
How about actual representation? We'd like you to ditch your corporate masters. We don't need grants, we need a Senator. @mcall @SenBobCasey
Know what I can't find on your site? Any info about a town hall! When will you schedule one in Philly?
Can we get a federal grant to rent an auditorium so you can have a town hall!?!!
I'd be willing to pay for it myself if he agreed to hold a town hall in Philly.
He's never come to Philly! We'd crush him
Senator, Trump just reversed his Monday statement, went backwards on first.  Time to decide.   Are you standing with Trump, or America?
#25thAmendmentNow or impeachment.  2 choices, but we will get to bipartisan pragmatic solutions faster with one. @SenBobCasey
We need Feds to not be nazi racists who also touch their toes for Putin...
Need u r healthcare taken away? Call Pat ToMe 1-800 -KochSucker
Thank you so much for speaking out so forcefully in connection with Charlottesville and President Trump's odious remarks.  (Sarcasm.)
Um. Hello....over here.  Yes, here! We would like to have an in person town hall as promised. Times a ticking,still waiting. #liar #TownHall
Sure, UD totally doable for Town Hall. I'd drive there. When? Anywhere? @ChrisMurphyCT walking across CT to listen to his voters. And u?

How about a federal grant to combat white supremacists and Nazis? Are you for that?
Where is your Trump response? Will you take a stand? COURAGE??
Your silence equals approval of Trump's enabling of the white supremacists in Charlottesville & around the world. Please stand up for us.
Perhaps they could help put out Trump's latest ! So where is your outrage, afraid of your daddy? Coward!
thats awesome. When are you going to finally be on the right side of history with trump though?
Are you planning on standing up to our Nazi sympathetic president?
How can you continue to stand by this president?
#Charlotteville nazis wont march in Philly,they chose Pitts TeaPartyToomey wont set foot in Philly either He doesnt care how many Americans
When will you denounce the racism of our President. For the love of God you believe in All men were created equal.
Can we get to DENOUNCE the Nazi sympathizer in the WH and to pressure your colleagues in the House to #impeach45
Need a spineless Senator to not stand up against the Nazi influenced WH? Visit Pat's site: NoBallsToomey
Did you watch that press conference??? Our "leaders" need to take action and remove Trump from office immediately. DO YOUR SWORN DUTY!!!
Quit
Fed grant? A hand out from you who want to slash fed budget? Hint: people need help, just like these firefighters do.
I need help getting you to hold a town hall & denounce DJT for the evil mongering racist that he is. How do I get you to do this?
How about a grant for more police officers to fight their drug problem!
Now, how about fighting FOR our healthcare, instead of against it.  And FOR our environment, instead of against it.  THINK, Toomey.
How about YOUR republican right radicals in Charlottesville? How about an answer? Man up for once in your life.
Sen . Toomey , it's time to take a stand against Trump . Country not party!
Don't tax the poor to benefit the rich.
Stop pretending that you give a damn about anyone but yourself.  You and the traitor @realDonaldTrump are destroying America #GOPLiesMatter
Now that you've gotten this done, do you have a minute to act against that crazy man in the White House? Your party owns everything he does.
The only  we need is your sad vacant non existent spine fired.
What are you doing about voter disenfranchisement?
I thought we needed lower federal gov't $$$$ dependence and privatization is good. Whose side are you on? The people's???
Let me get this straight, if we need a grant we're good 2contact U, but if we're in danger of losing healthcare we should die in slence. SMH
Yeah.  You're a hero, Pat.  A hero afraid to hold a town hall.  Does some of your money live in Upper Darby or something?
When is your Town hall Senator?  open to the public, any public, in the same room with you, not pre-selected, questions not filtered by you?
Need #25thAmendmentNow for @realDonaldTrump, is what we need. #Trumpnazi #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpRussia #Trumpunfit
You're the guy crying about the cost of ACA, right? You're ready to dole out grant money? Comments on your party's nomination of a racist?
Why don't you work on stopping the damage Trump is doing to the country.
How about you visit your site and hold a town hall? Need directions?
No nazis in the people's' house--do something about it!
WE CANNOT START THIS!!
LET'S  BE MORE FRUGAL,,,,
EVERYONE HAS TO TIGHTEN THE BUDGET,,STOP   GIVING IN!!
When is your town hall?
Your party leader continues to employ white supremacists in OUR White House. Speak up or you endorse it coward.
No representative at AFGE event last week at Knoebels?  Whats your position on FERS? @SenBobCasey,  @RepCartwright ,clear in their support.
OUR MILITARY REARMAMENT NEEDS ARE GREATER THAN THIS AND VA WOUNDED VETS,&VA FAMILIES,, MILITARY FAMILIES,TOO!
EVERYONE HAS 2B UNDERSTANDING
We need fed help to get rid of a racist, hate-filled, treasonous president.  Will your office help us with this or will you be MIA as usual?
U ARE ANGERING OTHER HOUSES & FIREFIGHTERS THAT NEED MONEY TOO!! WILL U SLIGHT&ANGER OTHERS?? IN ALL FAIRNESS ! START A PRECEDENT, NOT GOOD!
Thank you Sen. Toomey!!
No more white supremacists in the White House - Bannon, Gorka and Miller must go! Speak out and condemn this Administration.
When you don't speak out against it, you are supporting them.

HOW MANY FIRE,FIGHTERS NEED MONEY IN PA?? MANY!!
1.5 MIL × NUMBER  OF FIRE FIGHTERS!!
How about you pressure @realDonaldTrump to fire #WhiteSupremacists in the @WhiteHouse: Bannon, Gorka, & Stephen Miller
