Your unwillingness to have a town hall sure makes it look like you're hiding something. Who can trust what you say?
Town Hall.
We need to communicate face to face not watch television.  Town hall with constituents is necessary.
DISCUSS THIS WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS, #Doofus!
Please meet with your constituents
Lets talk about a single payer system.
Why not talk to us Pat?  Chicken sh!t   1/2 million from big Pharma Pat. What's that all about?  Thought you worked for us Pat?  Talk to us.
Not sit on some stage where you plan out all the questions. TALK TO US PAT!
TOWN...HALL...MEETINGS!!!
Too bad u won't come out of hiding and talk to constituents face2face @TuesdaysToomey @IfUSeePat @toomeytownhall #fauxnews
Wouldn't it be a better idea to communicate directly with PA voters through an open town meeting?
So what you're saying is you'll go on Fox News, but you won't hold a town hall and talk with the people from Pa. @PaHouseDems @PaSenateDems
Why don't you didcuss #BetterCare with your constituents? #tweetiatrician #KeepKidsCovered #keepkids #talk2meaboutmypatients
No thanks. I am so sorry my taxes pay for you & your family to have the healthcare you would deny your constituents. You are a shameful man
I assume she asked only the questions you wanted to be asked. Right @SandraSmithFox . . . Was @SenToomey's  interview fixed?
#resign
How about with the people of Pennsylvania?
I will tune in when you actually show up in Philly and face your constituents. @TuesdaysToomey
So you're still hiding from PA residents by not doing an open town meeting!What a chicken!We will vote no for you during your next election!
#WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall #WeWantATownHall
How about a town hall meeting? Any planed for this break?
When will you have a local townhall?
Maybe discuss this president's erratic behavior.  What the heck is happening???
Instead of shilling for your party's favorite channel, I hope you'll tune in to the needs of your constituents. #SaveACA #killthebill
There you go appearing on Fake Fox News again! Why not try a MSM outlet for tough questions?
How about a real town hall where you do not get to choose the attendees and questions?
That's just more lobbyist spin. @GOP are just legislating special interest lobbyists.
Why don't you actually discuss health care with your constituents? Coward!
Yo Pat, look! You made #4 on the list. Answers my question about how much it costs to buy a senator.
PA is not amused
We need to vote out Toomey he not meeting with us we need to re all him. Get his ads out.
#FakeNews  #toomeysucks stop with the lies Toomey. Your own people don't even like you.  #paforchange
We prefer you discuss it in person, at a town hall - COWARD!
It would be so much better to discuss at a town hall meeting
GOP Medicaid cuts would hurt much more than health care - https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/26/republican-medicaid-cuts-damage-more-than-health-column/426939001/ … via http://news.google.com 
I called all your offices. No one answered. When patriotic Americans protested your draconian plans you had them arrested. #SaveObamaCare
Sunday futures?  Who the hell is this guy representing? Wall street?  #stoptoomeycare

Hey Senator Toomy.. We do not believe you on health care. Why are you following Trump? Have a town hall meeting and find out how we think
Ha wonder how that went...
Hope you'll listen to voters who don't want this "reform "!
So you can lie to those who will believe your lies.
When is your town hall Senator? Or do not want to face your constituents who you will be decimating their healthcare?
Without some hearings in established committees, I do not trust your talking points.  You wrote the bill, let @SenBobCasey review and ? You

Your bill is awful & inhumane. p.s. A true Town Hall doesn't require an invite. Stop hiding. #ToomeyTownHall #realPA 19154
Stop Stop Stop JUST STOP WITH THE LIES
Instead, when are you going to discuss it with the voters of Pennsylvania? #NoTownHallSinceWhen
Toomey only on FOX cause they wont ask the real questions. Easy 2 defend your position when host throws easy pitches.
Visit the people of PA who you actually work for! Big corporations are not people despite what ur party believes.
Why not talk to your constituents face-to-face, instead of fielding softball questions on Fox?
WHEN WILL YOU DISCUSS HEALTHCARE WITH US MIDDLE CLASS WORKING PA FOLKS #TownHall @TuesdaysToomey @WhatsPatUpTo @FairDistrictsPA @PADems
Sorry don't watch FOX. Vote No
Maybe you could go on another network also? Defend, I mean explain, the bill. You're not afraid of a REAL interview, right? #nogutsnoglory
But you won't schedule a #townhall? You have time for conservative media outlets but not your constituents? #coward
Gosh. That would be nice, except I won't be able to ask you any questions maybe you could actually MEET WITH PEOPLE. You know, in public
When will you be discussing this directly with your constituents?  I would like to attend.
What about talking about it directly with your constituents instead of hiding behind a TV show? It's called a Town Hall. Try it.
Help us stop Trumps bullying!
Medicaid support is pro life! @GOP hypocrites!
JESUS CHRIST. SERIOUSLY? MAYBE A GOOD FEE DAYS HEADS UP MIGHT MAKENIT POSSIBLE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO SHOW UP!?
Sorry, you lost me at tax break....
GOP GENOCIDE  The  republican way to balance the budget because  GOP AM NOT GIVING UP MINE, from a BURNED OUT SHELL of a voter
Let's put a face on people you are planning on screwing over
Do address: 
Association Health Plans for Small Groups & Self-Employed under #BRCA |Kaiser Family Foundation
Coming up ever, your denunciation of the way Trump is demeaning the office of POTUS and ruining US? Nah, you're too busy w Trumpdeathcare
What do you REALLY know about healthcare that you haven't been told?
How is it better care? Truly curious.
Ok, we got next, @SenToomey!!  Hope you'll SHOW UP!
Tax cuts for the wealthy is NOT BETTER CARE OR HEALTHCARE REFORM!!! #SaveMedicaid #SavetheACA #BCRAkills #TrumpCareKills
Yay. More lies
Trump has denounced anonymous sources. How bout u ask ur buds @Fox bout those anonymous sources they quoted in his defense
Allowing states to wave min standard for insurance? Bad.
Medical Bankruptcy in United States, 2007: a National Study http://bit.ly/swQjk6 
#OpposeBCRA #OpposeAHCA #AHCAKills #AHCAisIMMORAL #Trumpcare Oppose this measure. It could be a death sentence for tens of millions. 15126

Well done. Get together so message isn't so foggy ... @POTUS should be helping clarify facts rather than name-calling MSM & haters.
#BCRA confirms what Brookings Institute reported:
ACA premiums are lower than you think AND ethical
http://brook.gs/2cPN0Z7 
Cutting people from the healthcare and eldercare they NEED is not a solution: it make the problem worse.
So did you see Trump's twitrage today? Is this man President? Do you believe he is capable of meeting a crisis? Does he make you proud?
I'll tune in when you tune out.&'s WO
EyesandEarsWideOpen #EAEWO
Are you going to lie again that your trash "healthcare" bill doesn't cut Medicaid? 

How abt mtg with ur constituents face-to-face to debate @DelcoIndivisib1 abt the facts of ur plan. If so great for us, what's the worry?
Will u be discussing why you think taking insurance away from hardworking Americans is considered "healthcare"?
Not concerned about Pennsykvanuas, just cozying up to Trump. Should have been honest during campaign..that you would be trump lapdog
#FUlLLREPEAL time to start over!
It will be the same old shit, don't bother
Can't wait to watch! I love being lied to.
Why are you hiding?
Come to PA and discuss healthcare with your constituents. You work for us, remember? We won't forget. Coward. #TrumpCareKills
When you are on a real channel or answer real questions, happy to tune in.  Softball propaganda machine, no thanks.
Town hall? We would like you to hear us.
How about discussing with someone that has a brain and is not bleeding from somewhere (apology-could not resist)
Discuss it with your constituents which you represent!!!!
Did you submit the questions yourself?
Oh, is that live? Can we, the people, attend?
Do you care at all? The people of Pennsylvania are not insects you can crush and throw in the garbage we are human beings
By the way, any comments on POTUS behaviors? How long you going to let a mad man live in WH and create national chaos. You are complicit
Fake news.
Enjoyed your interview with Jake Tapper.
Oh heck no.
why don't you talk to your constituents about the bill?
Because he's is in their pocket that's why- https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00001489&type=I …
88% of Americans don't want your Trumpcare. We are not buying what you are selling! No means No. #AHCAkills #BCRA #gop #Liar #SaveMedicaid

Unless you are going to announce that you are changing your vote to NO, we couldn't be more disinterested. #Resign #Resist
He has time to lie on TV but not to: a)hold public town halls b)listen to his voicemails- all of his office mailboxes R FULL #ToomeyTownHall
if you're going to appear on TV Make It Real News faux news! Better how about ur real constituents
If it's #BetterCare then why not host town halls to talk to your constituents?  Why the tax cut for Rich equal to Medicaid? #Trumpcare
Btw 19125 still wants a town hall
What a surprise, you are again going on Fox. I'm sure you are ready for the tough questions and hard hitting journalism!
Your bill is a tax cut for the rich. It is not healthcare reform. Do your job and fix ACA!
You know, I have seen Punxsutawney Phil more times this year, than I have seen you! Step up you dead eyed rodent! #SixYearsOfBullshit
don't watch fox ever.
You better get some health care for DJT.
You realize we see the truth right? This bill with hurt those who need help to benefit the wealthy. Your support of this is disgraceful.
#bettercareformillionaires
Your heath care plan: Die, go bankrupt, only use emergency room services and don't pay. Isn't freedom of choice great.
Why don't you start discussing the juvenile behavior of YOUR president. Talk about his mental illness. That's an important health issue.
How do you stand by Trump ? He is a disgrace to our Country. Watch his latest gif tweet. When do you hold him accountable ?
Too me, do you do all your not in person meeting from a remote location outside of Pa?
How often are you in the state? Why do you fear us?
I hope she asks you why you won't meet your constituents in Renault, pre-scheduled town hall meetings.
When do you intend to discuss this "reform" with your constituents in a town hall? I think they have a few things to tell you. #realPA
Talk to us in person about your tax rebate for rich folks like you. Fox News...coward
Good job Sen. Toomey..You may be the only republican that can explain the health care bill. You should be the official spokesman & often 
He is the chicken speaks to  and hide behind  the camera!  SAD
Nope, not interested in an infomercial. Face your constituents at a Town Hall.
interesting how she has "fox" in her name? HAVE A TOWN HALL IN PERSON W AUDIENCE QUESTIONS
How about 1 town hall with the people you are supposed to represent for every 3 appearances on fox news!
How about discussing it with , you know, your constituents, the people who pay your salary?
Looks like a bunch of democrats want you to have a town hall so they can slander you, so sad
How about a discussion with the people you represent?
the question is will you do right by your constituents? The ACA isn’t perfect but better the the new bill! VOTE NO!!! #traitor
Coming up soon: I'll be discussing health care reform with @SandraSmithFox on @SundayFutures. hope you'll tune in! #BetterCare
You mean, "coming up soon: I'm gonna lie to the public and then go crawl back and hide under my rock." That's what you meant right?
Oh look, a PA senator who actually cares about ALL his constituents.
How about you hold a town hall with your constituents? How about you listen to the outcry regarding this mean spirited #TrumpCare. #RealPA
Do you still refer to yourself as a Christian?  Asking for a friend. #SHAMEONYOU!
Will you be discussing how you're hurting the most vulnerable in our society to enrich yourself and your friends?
Hold a town hall.
Let me guess, Pat. You want a huge tax cut for the wealthy and to gut Medicaid and raise premiums for the poor? God bless the USA
How unpopular is #Trumpcare?

NPR/PBS/Marist: 17%
USA Today/Suffolk: 12%
Quinnipiac: 16%
The American people do not want this. It's immoral
You wrote a bill almost everyone hates.  Maybe you should rethink things.
Pat Toomey is a IDIOT
Will you be discussing how you are dismantling Patients Bill of Rights? #notbettercare
How bout discussing resigning for your position and giving PA some real leadership that puts people first #bettersenator
Try hanging out with Pennsylvanians instead of Fox sycophants.

You're still on this? Please give up on trying to steal our health insurance. You're going to be sorry on election day. 19428 #ToomeyTheTool
STOP TALKING TO MEDIA! Start talking WITH your constituents. You might learn how incredibly scared they are of your proposed healthcare bill
Bullshit. I call bullshit. Sorry to curse, but.....
You forgot to mention the $900 BILLION TAX CUT FOR YOURSELF AND THE OTHER 1%ers!  Call this the #MASA Make America Sick Again Tax Gift to 1%
Discuss the president's insane tweets today. Stop dancing around the fact he is appearing unhinged.
Don't miss new experience of double talk.
You're discussing a tax cut for the richest, not 'healthcare'. Let's be honest- didn't your mother tell you it's a sin to lie?
Will you be explaining why you never do townhalls & actually speak with the people you are supposed to represent? Your #PinkSlipIsComing!
Please preserve Medicaid for millions of Americans.

...from a hidden secret bunker no where near PA
So were you sitting around thinking to yourself...hmmm should I hold a townhall with my constituents in Pa or go on Fox News?
I CANT GET A RAISE IN SSI but ABLE bodied ppl w ZERO dependents can get medicaid?? Dont u know thats why 1/2 the ppl on welfare dont work??
Would rather stick forks in both eyes instead of listening to your hypocritical lies!!!!
Please cut Medicaid!!!!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
You speak more about health care with Fox than w/ your PA constituents, many of whom will lose medical care w/ GOP plan #AHCA #BCRA
The GOP Bettercare bill neglects  "health" and "care". Shame on you.
#Traitor Can't wait until you're no longer in office.
When are you going to join Dems in invoking the 25th amendment
Pat, YOU SUCK! MAKE AMERICA SICK AGAIN.
Pat your a bumbling apologist for for the GOP/TP. Oh heck you're just a liar, coward, getting a free ride on our dime
Hey, Pat. Happy July 4th weekend. Hope you're enjoying time off. How about a town hall this week somewhere in Pennsylvania? #ToomeyTownHall
Please explain how you can shave every morning knowing that people will die due to your blind support of the ACHA.
He hires someone to do it for him because vampire reflections don't show up in mirrors.
Coming up soon: I'll be lying about health care...
Enough with the news reporters already. Don't you think it's high time you sit down for your interview with your constituents?
Please address the instability of our president, who tweeted committing violence against our press on the we of celebration of independence
We want Medicare for all, not tax cuts for your friends pat
When will you be discussing health care reform with your constituents? How about a Town Hall during your next few days off? #ToomeyTownHall
You might want to discuss the mental health of Trump. You follow him blindly-might want to get your eyes checked!
#FraudNewsCNN #FNN 
How about you discuss with the people of your state?! #AnyoneButToomey2022 #ILiveIn15108
Senate GOP Health Bill Would Raise Out-of-Pocket Costs in Every State https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-gop-health-bill-premiums/ … #ProtectOurCare
We hope you will be discussing a Medicare for all solution.
What are you doing about annual/lifetime caps for people who PAY for their insurance?  Will non-watered down policies still be available?
Discuss with your constituents. #townhall #timidpattoomey
22 million without insurance, tax cuts for the wealthy, increased costs for seniors, higher deductibles-better care for the "connected!"
U R talking about ACA?

When is your next town hall in LV?  Inquiring minds want to know.
When are your town hall meetings in PA scheduled? When will you get bigger phone inboxes?
Here's a novel idea Senator, how about holding several face2face town halls across PA with ur CONSTITUENTS?  Fox doesn't ask tough questions
