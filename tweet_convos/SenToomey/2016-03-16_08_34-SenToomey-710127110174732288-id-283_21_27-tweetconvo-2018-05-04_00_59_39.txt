I will do everything I can, as a Pennsylvanian, to make sure we never hear your ridiculous opinion on anything in the future!
@SenToomey obstructionist
@SenToomey
@SenToomey and no one Obama submits will anything like Scalia!!!!
@SenToomey we elected a president already. Stop blocking court appointments before we all loose faith in the courts. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey STOP PLAYING POLITICS AND START TAKING ACTION FOR THE COUNTRY. #ImpeachToomey #DoYourJob
@SenToomey with your own re-election at stake, why continue to obstruct Obama's candidate for Supreme Court? See you on election day!
.@SenToomey Click here to SUPPORT Toomey's CHALLENGER, Joe Sestak and end the obstructionists! http://joesestak.com 
@SenToomey A President by the People, For the People is in Our Oval Office. You do not represent all Americans only the White Folks. Resign
@SenToomey it is not for you to decide, the law is clear. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey eight months is a long time to commit to NOT DOING YOUR JOB! good luck with that come November #VoteToomeyOut
@SenToomey Dereliction of duty will get you a Court Martial in the military. Do you think you're better than our soldiers? #DoYourJob
@SenToomey yeah. Just leave the balance st steak for another 8 months then. Totally makes sense. #DoYourJobFriday #shameful
@SenToomey why? Will the next president nominate a more qualified judge than Garland? Foolish partisanship in congress has made Trump.
@SenToomey I'd bet money if any of the conservative SCOTUS judges were to move on, you'd be passing this guy in a heartbeat.  Grow up
@SenToomey I voted for #Obama to nominate #SCOTUS justices from 2012-2016. #timestamp 2:00pm March 18, 2016.
@SenToomey The American peeps elected Obama in 2008 and again in 2012, and his term does't end until 1/2017. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey Do not mettle with the constitution.
@SenToomey Please don't consider Garland's nomination. He's far too conservative. #WaitForARealLiberal
@SenToomey it's time to do your job otherwise you will not reelected
@SenToomey That's chance u take in democracy. Using euphemisms for rethuglican RACISM. Disgusting
.@SenToomey You mean you are so unable to think that it would take over 8 months to confirm a justice.  You are either LAZY or a RACIST!
@SenToomey 1/3 of POTUS nominated SCOTUS in an election year. Follow the constitution-there are no "ifs" in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2.
@SenToomey With this logic, you should recuse yourself from any further action in the Senate. Your election is also fewer than 8 months away
.@SenToomey Let me guess, you're going to step out and wear your big boy pants? Or is the thumb-sucking senate still buying diapers in bulk?
@SenToomey That is not how it works! We elected a president and you don't get to cut his time short. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey beat it, nerd
@SenToomey clean out ur damn desk. U r fired.
@SenToomey with the Constitution at stake it is time 2 do ur job. Heed r voice. PBO nomination 4 #SCOTUS needs 2 go thru process n voted on
@SenToomey wrong. We have spoken. Our direct voice voted him Prez with all executive rights. He is not 3/5 a Prez no matter what u feel.
@SenToomey Please do the job you were elected to do and vote on the supreme court nominee #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee #SCOTUS.
@SenToomey by not voting you are disrespecting all 3 branches of govt.  ignoring power of exec branch, hindering jud. Branch #shameonToomey
@SenToomey The people have spoken. Obama is President. Now do your job.
@SenToomey you want to disregard a quarter of the presidents term. Should the same apply to you since you are in last year of your term?
@SenToomey EIGHT MONTHS IS A PRETTY LONG TIME!!!! #Fail It's your political funeral.
@SenToomey if I was to wait 11 months to do my job I would be fired. Maybe the people of Pennsylvania will remember this next election.
@SenToomey 8 months is a long freaking time for a job to be empty. If we can go that long without a replacement, do we need one? #doyourjob
@SenToomey quit playing politics over a moderate judge and #DoYourJob
@SenToomey this is one way to not be reelected
@SenToomey #DoYourJob instead of being a typical POS how about you represent the state that voted for Obama TWICE!!!
@SenToomey you are a typical Republican of the last 30 years. Don't get your way you take your ball and go home. Resign now.
@SenToomey Do your damn job!

Stop playing politics like you always do.
@SenToomey I am so disappointed in this stand. Lifelong Republican but very unhappy.
@SenToomey shame on you. Boo hiss!! We the people want you to #DoYourJob
@SenToomey Do your job now or watch us do our job when you are running.  #SCOTUS
@SenToomey buddy, he has, like, the better part of the year left in office and the American people reelected him. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey So you think the president has no authority to do anything for eight months?
@SenToomey #DoYourJob and stop promoting yr ridiculous argument
Be consistent @SenToomey W/ your "election fewer than eight months away," ALL your votes shouldn't count. Let the new PA Senator (D) decide.
@SenToomey you won't have the chance to vote for the #SCOTUS nominee of the next president once you too get voted out
@SenToomey Do your job and select a Supreme Court justice NOW!
@SenToomey #NeverTrump
@SenToomey Sure you would argue the same thing if this happened under Pres. Romney...#politicsasusual
@SenToomey the people elected the president to a 4 year term ... You should allow Garland's nomination to poceed
@SenToomey How do u reconcile not doing what we, your constituents elected u to do? I say u shd be removed fr office. #scotus #recalltoomey
Why should a 1/3 of the Senate get to vote by that reasoning? Those seats up for election in Nov. @SenToomey #SCOTUS
@SenToomey #doyourjob!!!!! #doyourjob!!!!!!! Holy crap you #senaterepublicans are infuriating!!!
@SenToomey I hope people will vote you out soon! You're not qualified for this job! #DoYourJob #treason #pattoomey
@SenToomey #DOYOURJOB ! #treason
@sentoomey you should do your job or resign
@SenToomey still more time left than the longest confirmation in U.S. History for SCOTUS nomination
@SenToomey - For someone who works 149 days a year, it's not too much to ask that you #DoYourJob
@SenToomey I can think of no scenario in which I would ever vote for you because of your position and empty interpretation of your duty.
@SenToomey do your job as a representative of the people and support a vote. Stop contributing to the destruction of the party.
@SenToomey #DoYourJob Word of advice, WalMart is always in need of Greeters. Republican Party is off the chain.
@SenToomey ..."We want to make sure that the GOP has the best possible chance to ruin everything for the next 50 years. Oops. I meant "run."
@SenToomey That wasn't even a complete thought, idiot.
@SenToomey #DoYourJob I'm in #PA and I will be voting against you in the next election. #SCOTUS
@SenToomey do your job
.@SenToomey You are my senator. Please do your job.
@SenToomey do your job, or we as your constituents will make sure you have no job come the next election
@SenToomey the President is doing his job. Maybe you should do yours. Or give your paycheck back.
@SenToomey With elections less than 8 months away, I demand Senators cease their work until people can vote on their successors. It's fair.
@SenToomey if Mitch tells you to flip and "cut your losses" with Garland, you'll do it. What will you say then? What a joker.
@SenToomey Thank you for doing your job by not *consenting* to approve another radical justice. Stand strong. Your work is appreciated.
@SenToomey I suspect you won't enjoy reelection to the Senate from a state like PA if you refuse to do the job you are paid to do.
@SenToomey This is the problem with tea party morons...DO YOUR JOB
@SenToomey ugh
@SenToomey "...with the presidential election fewer than eight months away..." you have decided to avoid your responsibilities as Senator.
@SenToomey #DoYourJob          If I didn't do my job I'd get fired!
@SenToomey The President nominated a candidate for the Supreme Court. If you are unwilling to follow the Constitution then step down #SCOTUS
@SenToomey You are playing partisan politics.  Why not support the Constitution even when it doesn't suit your views? #scotus #doyourjob
@SenToomey Check the polling Senator, if you don't even give him a hearing I think you can guarantee you are one and done #doyourjob
@SenToomey "and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter"
@SenToomey "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States."
@SenToomey I'm a PA voter. Hit the breaks on this.
@SenToomey Do your damn job!
@SenToomey Along with the rest of your party, you're an embarrassment. No wonder #Trump is in the ascendancy. Architects of your fate.
@SenToomey Announce when your term is over, because I'm a teacher in Oklahoma, but I want 2 help get U removed, U R A very Sad/Bad white man
@SenToomey Do your job. Give Merrick Garland a fair hearing. Stop being a tool!
@SenToomey After 1/20/17 Inauguration of POTUS 45, we will be in February b4 hearings are held. That's 11 months w/out a 9th Justice. Fair?
@SenToomey Obama is POTUS until next January. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey Please point to me where it says that it's the Senate's responsibility to obstruct judicial nominees. Moron.
@SenToomey @POTUS is still the POTUS until January of 2017. DO YOUR JOB.
@SenToomey I'm gonna go out on a limb and say if our current POTUS was of the GOP persuasion you'd be all for a confirmation right damn now.
@SenToomey It not wise. Just games.
@SenToomey "we think we might get a more conservative nominee if we fuck around for eight months."
@SenToomey You'd really prefer a Trump nominee over Justice Garland? Really? #DoYourJob
@SenToomey Your job to the American people is to #DOYOURJOB. This party idiocy is what has caused the low approval rating of congress.
@SenToomey and what is your basis for this determination?
@SenToomey Hey maybe your boy Donnie Trump will win and nominate his peer Judge Judy.
@SenToomey 8 MONTHS. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey I think if you honestly say, "we are rolling the dice to see who is elected," people will respect you more and not run to Trump.
@SenToomey do your job
@SenToomey  too busy protecting big corporations to be bothered with such trivial matters
@SenToomey Eight months. You are an embarrassment to the job and your country.
@SenToomey  funny, when you were running for office, I missed the part where you said doing your job would be optional
@SenToomey If you can't hold a hearing within 8 months then you aren't fit to be a US Senator. #SCOTUS
@SenToomey And an ELECTED President in office.
@SenToomey Yeah, that asshole had to die when it wasn't a good time, right?!  #amirite
@SenToomey you're right. We should all just take the next 8 months off. Do your job, Senator. The rest of us still have to do ours.
Do your job please @SenToomey. To provide advice and give consent to appointments, not to obstruct process. See U at the polls! @SCOTUSnom
@SenToomey With the laws of the US at stake, & less than 8 months until the election, no Senator up for election should get to vote! Logic!
@SenToomey I think it is great that true conservatives like you can manage to create brand new traditions out of thin air!
@SenToomey  What if Bernie or Hillary wins? Are you going to say "the election is fewer than 4 years away"? Do your job- you tool.
@SenToomey 8 months is 1/6 of his term. Will you not vote for anything in the last year of yours? Probably not bc your policy is stagnation.
@SenToomey If you persist in ignoring the appointment you can count on not receiving another vote from me. #SCOTUS #SCOTUSnominee
@SenToomey Thank you. 2014 election has consequences as well as 2012. Congress is coequal and this is a legitimate constitutional choice.
@SenToomey  Do you think you'll be re-elected and have a say?  These stunts are why Trump is laughing while he breaks the GOP
@SenToomey We, the American people, already voiced our opinion when we re-elected President Obama 4 years ago. Do your job!
@SenToomey we already decided. #DoYourJob --for ONCE!
@SenToomey I can't wait to fire you this November  for dereliction of duty
@SenToomey Shame on you.
@SenToomey 8 months from not being a Senator...
@SenToomey Every time a Supreme Court justice in nominated the balance is potentially at stake you political hack. #DoYourDamnJob.
