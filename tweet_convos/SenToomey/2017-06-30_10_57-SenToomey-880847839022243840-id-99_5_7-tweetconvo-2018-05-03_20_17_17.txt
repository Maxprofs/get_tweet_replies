No one missed your lies and spin. Take away for lies of talking points and your interviews go down to awkward seconds of stalling. Resign.
,, Senator Toomey please vote no on this bill do not throw out of all the Care get the Democrats and save it bipartisan
SHUT THIS WEALTHcare DOWN.
@GOP So pious when it comes to abortion but have no problem with amoral healthcare plan.
ICYMI  I am from your state. I cannot wait to vote you out.
Same here
Me too.
Save lives. Stop trumpcare.
Wait until the reality of what you are doing personally hits voters in centra PA!
It's funny you never mention anyone who wants the single payer option? You are a creep!
Tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts for the poor & elderly is monstrous. What's your tally of constituent support vs opposition on this?
Really love the cherry picked info on this news post Senator. to anyone looking at the link read all the articles not just the excerpts.
Stop trying to confuse and BS your constitutes. We know what this bill is and what it does. As a catholic I don't know how you justify it.
How will this help the opioid crisis Senator Toomey? I live in Philly and someone ODed on my street sir. Like you care . TOWNHALL NOW 19125
I bet some others like @SenBobCasey also have some thoughts to share at a hearing.
uhh tough one, healthcare costs too much in this country and you idiots keep allowing it? #SinglePayerHealthcare #captilismvssocialservice
Can you and @SenBobCasey sit down and discuss this bill with each other?  I want to see who is more accurate.
It is not working man. You CANNOT sell us on this crappy bill. Get some morals and call it the evil mess that it is.
I literally feel like I'm in a Hall of Mirrors.
You are such a lemming. Follow Trump over the cliff.
How on earth can u say u would be ok with a repeal with no replacement? You're ok with some Pennsylvanians losing ALL of their healthcare!?
Funny how doctors, hospitals, insurers, & health economists don't support this premise. I guess your secret committee ignored experts. Bad!
I'm sure it is right leaning. No thanks. I have already done research and what the GOP is touting isn't true and will harm most of us.
Nicely cherry picked quotes. Your constituents don't approve of #TrumpCare or you. Hold a town hall. #RealPA
"Others"? You can't be talking about your constituents because we all know what they are saying!  BAD BILL
Tell it to our faces. #TownHall
ICYMI: your constituents would like an in-person town hall with you to answer questions
Because we are totally irrelevant.
We want your health care plan.
WHEN WILL YOU FACE THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT!!
ICYMI: Your constituents want you to hold a town hall
In case YOU missed it Pat, well over 700k Pennsylvanians will lose healthcare under your "healthcare" bill.
Have you listened to what your constituents have to say about it? Nope? Just "others". Let's do a townhall, Pat. Western PA awaits.
I know u WROTE this bill Pat but in case ur not paying attention I'll let u on a secret...it's nothing to be proud of
#townhall? #byepat
there clearly appears to be a total disconnect between you and your constituents. How about a town hall?
Why do Republicans name laws with the opposite meaning than the law's effect? Better Care Act? C'mon, it's the Worse Off Act. #LyingToomey
Keep digging...
So have a town hall to meet with the people of Pennsylvania who employ u  rather that FoxNewsYou will not b u shouldStop voting party lines
IT'S NOT BETTER WHEN IT'S LESS, NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY TO TRICK PEOPLE- YOUR CONSTITUENTS. SHAME ON YOU!!
Republican Congress and administration appear to be becoming morally bankrupt.
In Pennsylvania, the av monthly premium for a silver plan under the Senate bill would be $403, 72 percent higher than under the ACA in 2020.

ICYMI: your bill is a tax cut for the 1% at the expense of the rest of us.
Still a no. How about that town hall?? 19144
My wife and I are constituents. 
We haven't made the deep cut yet. 
We'll just be phasing you out for 2020. 
Don't worry you will be okay.
If this passes with your vote the suffering and earths of YOUR CONSTITUENTS will be on your conscience. You are a monster to be ok with this
GOPhealthcareIsMurder!
Or because you are so righteous. What would Jesus Say????
Like my grandfather would say, I don't give a s...t what others say. I'm the one that has to use it!
WHY DONT you care what WE, the voting public that will use this healthcare have to say??????.
Conveniently forgetting the increases in out of pocket expenses, pre existing conditions, caps on employer plans. Oh. The $800mil tax break
You can't spell sycophant with out Pat, @SenToomey
Proof that if you dig deep enough you can find anything.
Looks like a whos whos for wall street profits. What does the medical and caregivers say??
Hey Pat! Got any plans for the Fourth??  
Hold town halls, meet with YOUR CONSTITUENTS, listen to our healthcare needs.
You know who/how they come by those numbers and so do we. What part of WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION do you not get? You're a liar and a disgrace
Why do you hate America and her people so much?
ICYMI: It's time that you listen to your constituents and not the amount of money you get from insurance companies.
WTF is wrong with you? Don't you understand WE DONT want your plan! How can Pennsylvanias support a Senator that Supports Donald Trump!
#toomeydoesntcare is right. You are rich, you're fine with taking away our #healthcare to line your own pockets. #shame #AHCAKills
All 12% of them.....
The plan would undermine the care our nation’s veterans receive. We can't turn our back on them.
Stop...what your doing is not easing concerns...how much will go into YOUR pocket?
Please just stop already.. we know what you're doing and we're not buying your bs
Get rid of Medicaid!!! make people save and take care of themselves!
You are turning Medicaid into an unfunded mandate. At least be honest about what you are doing.
How about leaving Medicare the fuck alone if you want another term
HMMM STILL NO ZIP 19454
Your link to The Hill is broken. Also, a better q might be why growth of CPI-U<CPI-M. Hint: not because more $$$ is there for med expenses
Others are saying that you should give up your position as senator. You don't represent PA & you collude in secret to steal from the poor.
ICYMI: the people of PA don't want your shitty bill.
How about some kind of doctor, nurse, eldercare specialist, or anyone who knows what they're talking about?
ICYMI: Your constituents want a town hall
Stop pretending. If you were so confident, you wouldn't be avoiding your constituents.
My god, this is laughable
No, we didn't miss a beat. You're trying to make things out to be better than they are to fool those that will be hardest hit.
ICYMI the people of your state would like so.e town meetings before we vote you out on #2020
#ToomeyTheTool, we do not want this bill. We reject it and we reject you. Start listening to your constituents, or resign.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
Please go take an Arithmetic class; then a statistics class.
You do not understand the concept of Delta
