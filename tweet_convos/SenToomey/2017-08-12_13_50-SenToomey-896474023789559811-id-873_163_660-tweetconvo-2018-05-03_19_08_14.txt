Southern strategy/states rights speech in Neshoba MS/welfare queens/gutting  the VRA. Pls don't act surprised by this, these folks voted 4 U
Yet you stand by Trump 100%.  Hollow words.  Using Trump as a puppet to harm Pennsylvanians.  Election time is near.
Agreed. Pls stop & rid us of Trump & his evil cohorts; he's a cancer on our country, unrepentant, unredeemable. Must go away ASAP.
Stand up for America, censure Trump for his support of Neo-Nazis and white supremacist, put America first, rise above patrician politics.
I don't just want to know you viewpoint on racism Senator. I want to know your viewpoint on this racist President.
Follow Flake's lead. Call Trump out on his support and use of alt-right
You and @gop are complicit in the racism, hate and violence by not standing up to tRump and his agenda of hate and violence.
Good first step now condemn Trump and withdraw your support from him and I'll believe you.   Publicly.
This is what you should have said. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @VP @PressSec #ITMFA

@piersmorgan
Thank you for your statement. Now please call out this president.
Surprised to see your statement... Thank you!!
While you're busy praying for guidance. And rationalization. Remember that Christ gave up power that was too seductive. How about you?
SAY HIS NAME. You need to stop playing it safe. Repudiate trump!
We can thank VA Gov, Mayor, Federal Judge for not doing their job. Let's remember @SenKaineOffice son was arrested for Alt Left violence.
What is your response to Trump's Tuesday presser?
Interesting that now Pelosi wants monuments moved from Congress.  How come her and Harry didn't do it when they ran things?
@NAACP @ACLU PA has one of the highest populations of white supremacist groups. WHAT R U DOING ABOUT IT? #VoteToomeyOut
That is a great question.
What can they do about it? They are protected by the Constitution. ACLU said so.
They have right to free speech and LAWFUL assembly. NO right to acts of domestic terrorism and murder. They MUST be held accountable!
agreed - and I hope you would support this same for the antifa and others that have committed acts of terrorism
Absolutely! We can't claim to have freedom if we censor; but when the line is crossed, you pay the price - giving up your freedom in jail!
But the antifa didn't have the bats, helmets, guns, mace, shields - they had signs, words, decency, courage - and fought back when attacked.
wrong!! Antifa are the ones who started bringing that crap to the protests.
so is the so called President #Traitor #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump you jagoff
What did you think of the Republican pres response to it?
Will you grow a set, and call out the President for what he truly is? Just be a human who truly gives a sh**--or continue as  a fool for PA!
Use his name. Use his stmt to back up ur statmt. Bet you'll follow him as he plays his fiddle. Sad really no proof u w do so.stop suprtng hm
You must repudiate Trump.
Please clarify your stand. Do you repudiate Nazis? Do you support @Potus statements yesterday?  #waiting #listening
Your President does not grasp this. Call him out by name.
And what about the racism, hate and violence seen from #Trump? No statement on that? Not that your silence is surprising anymore, of course
Where's your media appearance denouncing the President's "both sides"? You've done them for less pressing matters recently.
The president's response(s) to #Charlottesville have been vile and unacceptable. Will you denounce his actions as well? #GOP #Resist
So you are on the @realDonaldTrump side of the "many sides"? At least this is a record for where you stand in history.
Sir - do you support @realDonaldTrump comments, or will you specifically call him out by name for what he has said in the last few days?
What do you have to say about @realDonaldTrump? Speak up!!
It is. So when are you going to condemn the so-called @POTUS for his defense of literal nazis and white supremacists?
Rebuke Trump for his comments...an innocent woman died...stand up with the rest of Congress and DO something, not just talk
What actions do you intend to take that will counteract the racism, hate, and violence festering in this country, @SenToomey ?
When will you denounce the latest statements made by 45?
Pat Toomey - now is the time for you to stand up on your own.Racism, KKK, Nazi's have no place in America not just Charlottesville.
When will you repudiate the President?
I agree that racism and hate are unacceptable, the president's defense of it is also unacceptable, you need to publicly denounce him.
How about the racism, hate and violence supported by your president senator Toomey.....  is this going to be your only "stand"
Not enough. If the afl-cio can talk about this in plain language why can't you?
Not enough. More specifically is needed. After the Trump abomination of a Press Conference everyone including u know he is not fit 4 office
So what are you doing about @POTUS sanctioning white supremacy?  It's time to take action.  Country over party Senator Toomey.
That's it? A seminal moment in US history and that's all you've got? You just gave evidence of personal cowardice and lost my vote!
Your's is a 2 sides response. The 2 sides are American values vs Trump values. You clearly are on Trump's side. No vote for you!
How about you tell that to your daddy Trump?
Thank you for speaking up with clear condemnation. Now what will you do about @POTUS? Persuade your GOP peers to do something.
The racism and hate expressed by your president is vile and unacceptable.  You say nothing.  You do nothing.  Can you stand up just once???
Please back up your words and disavow the support of white nationalist groups that have put you and the President in office.
Call them by their names. Oh, and if you want to further align yourself with Trump, David Duke is a big fan. #spineless JENKINTOWN, PA
This is not enough Trump enforces White Supremacy denounce Trump Senator Pat Toomey have some morals
Speaking out ≠ leadership. Leadership would be @GOP @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP removing the white supremacist from office. Agenda conts. #winwin
Have some courage - call it what it is.
Too afraid to call out the racism and hatred spewing from the White House?
Please show your constituents you stand against racism by telling Trump his statements about the racists in Charlottesville are wrong.
We all agree that racism, hate and violence are vile. That's an easy call. @SenToomey it's time to denounce @realDonaldTrump for what he is.
The president is wrong to equate the racist Nazis in Charlottesville w/ the protestors standing up to them.  Please don't be silent on this.
Do you condone Trump's views on Charlottesville & the protestors who stood up against racism?
Not enough. You are whole heartedly supporting a white supremacist in the White House. Your silence is approval. Very fine people? KKK? Nazi
You can't be silent about Trump's obvious enabling of white supremacists. He needs their vote. Do you need/want the white supremacists vote?
Do you stand w/ Trump & white supremacists or do you stand w/ the rest of the democratic world?  Your silence speaks to approval of Trump.
I urge you to publically state your position on Trump's inability to support the Charlottesville protestors who stood up to racists Nazis.
So, no comment on the words of POTUS?
One short tweet about the weekend murder in a terrorist attack but a white supremacists, seriously?
What is the plan to stop this violence from coming to Pennsylvania? What is plan to keep these ppl from desecrating sites like Gettysburg?
It's time to denounce @realDonaldTrump and call for his #Impeachment. He's a bigot and racist and unfit to lead.
Wow making that statement probably left you breathless #worthlesssenator !!!
Please broadcast public statement to constituents exactly what you condemn: racist, anti-Semitic, terrorist Neo-Nazis & white supremacists.
Tell this to Trump. You must do better. You are failing the people of PA by not being more vocal against literal Nazi. We will remember this
and your thoughts on the racism, bigotry and ignorance of the President are what, exactly?
Glad you feel that way Pat.  Now get rid of the fascist chief.  Impeach today or be painted with the same brush.  Stand for America!
What Pres.said & did 8/15 is UNACCEPTABLE. Time 4 U & ALL GOP to speak out against Him.Easy 2 say racism is bad.Not speak'n up to him WORSE
When will you stand up in opposition to  this unfit @potus ? Your Oath of Office demands it. Asking for Pennsylvanians.
So is your President. Can u activate ur morality for once and denounce Trump and his hate agenda?
You know what else is unacceptable? You not voicing your disgust with @realDonaldTrump! He must be censured NOW! #CensureTrump
senator: how 'bout a comment on trump's latest comments?
You need to call out our incompetent @realDonaldTrump for his ambiguity and support for white supremacy. Stop hiding and represent us!!
Will you also condemn the president for his support of these unamerican racists. He’s just told them that they are in the right.
The racism hate and support for violence seen in New York today are vile.  Yet you have been silent today.
.... should be clear to all that Trump is unfit and must go. Make PA proud ... get on board to dump Trump now
That's a start, but aren't you tired of defending Trump? An almost nuclear war was only second worst thing he did in the last week ...
Do you mean from the president or from the neo-Nazis?
You need to call out the president.  Do you not represent America????  Grow a spine or say goodbye to your senate seat.
The racism and hate of Mr. Trump is vile.  Past time for you to condemn him.
So, that is all you have to say, you better stand tall, call him out & step away from him
Why haven't you denounced the KKK Neo-Nazis & white supremacists? Why haven't you denounced the #FakePresident @POTUS for not denouncing
Tell @POTUS that you condemn his remarks as immoral, reprehensible and adamantly against what you value as an American and as a US Senator!
Mr. Toomey your president is a Nazi. Take a stand for America.  DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!
What is your take on Trump's comments from today?  Care to tell your constituents how you will represent them?
I guess you think this is enough. You need to denounce nazis. It isn't hard.
You know who seems to find it acceptable? The president.
What is your response to Trump's remarks today? Denounce his false equivalency/ support of Nazi, White Supremacists
Just wondering when you will call Trump vile and unacceptable.
Your boy @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to think so. What are you going to do about it?
What is your opinion of Trumps positions stared today? Riding the wave to see where to bail out on Trump or is he OK by you?
Will you go on record denouncing the alt right white nationalist groups and racist participants as unamerican
It is time to renounce #TheRealDonaldTrump #POTUSTrump. Stand up and Speak out.
What about @realDonaldTrump quotes, today!?
This is not good enough. Condemn Trump's equivocation about white supremacists. Call for Bannon, Miller, Gorka to be fired.
Your low-key response to #Charlottesville does not do enough. We have a problem in the country and our leaders need to be more vocal.
Why do you fail time and time again to fervently stand up and speak out for what is morally right. White supremacy has no place is America.
You don't even mention Trump by name, coward.
Now it's time to say something about Trump's statement being unacceptable.
For the second time, Trump put Nazis on the same moral ground as counter protestors. What will it for you to invoke the 25th?
We need to hear more from you and Congress. What is happening to our country. This is not what my father fought for in WWII.
How much longer will you & the GOP allow this POTUS to damage our country? History is watching. Do the right thing: #25thAmendmentNow
Then stop gerrymandering and passing racist laws. Thanks.
Yes! Can you get DHS & DOJ in for a public hearing re combating the violent extremist white supremacists? Will you ask colleagues?
Keep rubber stamping every one of Trump's policies, Senator. We know whose side of the "racism, hate, and violence" you're on.
#IMPEACH
YOU voted for him now either denounce him or you are with him. It's time to step up. Drive down 857 or rt 119 in Fayette Co. confed flags!
Not strong enough. Say the words. Say you condemn white supremacy and neo nazi groups. Say it.
Are you going to say something about trump's comments today?
Not good enough. Try again.
Did you see @POTUS  last new conf. Please #STOP him.
Get rid of this bum in the white house. He is destroying our nation.
With due respect Rep. Toomey, enough with the usual “thoughts & prayers.” #Impeach the #WhiteSupremacist in the #WhiteHouse! DO SOMETHING!
do something abt it! Tell @realDonaldTrump you think he's a racist and fight to take him down! #25thAmendmentNow
Yet you support the racist in the White House and like him don not condemn the white supremacists Your silence speaks loudly
Agreed Pat, but when are you going to finally speak up against POTUS?  You have rarely done so and it will be remembered.
Your president doesn't think so.  Speak up!
Just like your master, @realDonaldTrump/@POTUS, you refuse to call out #NeoNazis, #WhiteSupremacists & the #AltRight—#pathetic #Lapdog.
Your actions when he does unacceptable things are indistinguishable from when he does acceptable things. What does that make you?
Yes, but will you stand against @realDonaldTrump @POTUS remarks today? Will you, regardless of party, call him out for his remarks?
Please comment on @POTUS comments defending white nationalists
So what is your stance on Trump's handling of it?
How can you let the US slip backwards?
Then grow a pair and  impeach @realDonaldTrump!
As a native Pennsylvanian and Latino (though now living in MA), I wish you'd make a strong statement against @POTUS ignorance
Go further than Trump. Call out the hate groups by name. KKK, Nazis, Antifa. Be more of a man than Trump. What does Jesus ask of you?
@SenToomey Do you support @POTUS and his views on #Charlotteville?
Do you still support DJT after his racist rants today? Grow a spine! He is not GOP.  #CNN #MSNBC #ABC #CBS #NBC #PBSNews #NPR @KRPA12
Not according to Trump today. I highly recommend you speak out and start condemning @realDonaldTrump
I not, then you agree with him. 
Yes, thank you for stating what most of us believe, now take a stand against POTUS and call for resignation. #resign
The racism, hate and support of violence from the WH is unacceptable.  What are you going to do about that?
You need to denounce President Trump.  His thoughts and statements are wrong and racist.  #ImpeachTrump His statements today are abhorrent.
Time to tell the same to @realDonaldTrump, @SenToomey. #RealPA #neveragain #NeverAgainIsNow
What did you think of the press conference today? Any response concerning statements by our Pres?
And what about the disgrace you helped to put in the White House? Will you ever denounce him???
And what do you have to say about Trump's press conference today?  Vile won't begin to cover it.
Going to tell Donald that...he seems not to agree with it.  do you also think its both sides like he does??????
Waiting for you to denounce the nazi's and alt right and put the blame where it belongs in Charlottesville.  Blame is not on both sides
Will you condemn Trump's comments? You are either on the side of good, or the side of evil. You can't equivocate on this one.
Tell your boy Trump to openly condemn it and not offer some mealymouth 'both sides' nonsense.
Enough is enough. Be a part of the solution & maybe just maybe you can still fall on the right side of history. #ImpeachTrumpNow
what did you think of @realDonaldTrump 's press conference today?
What about the vile remarks of @POTUS? Will @SenateGOP still stand by him? Is the GOP now for Naziism?! #thereIsOnlyOneside
When are you going to speak out and condemn @realDonaldTrump
The president, the leader over your party is saying it's both sides. He's not condemning it
Somebody stop this insanity. It's gone on way too longggggg. Please step up and do your job. Get rid of 45& make America proud again
So what took you so long? Will you denounce the POTUS for his Comments? Or do you support Nazis now too? http://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/08/14/charlottesville-reactions-trump-toomey/ …
We need to be specific, Senator. White supremacists take statements like these as support. Specifically call out KKK, Neo-Nazis, and POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump disagrees. He said so today. Do you repudiate his words? You need to say so!
Do you still support the POTUS after today? We deserve to know.
David Duke just thanked 45 for telling the truth about Saturday. Please act like an adult & responsible American.
Why can't you and @realDonaldTrump call out "White Supremacist Terror" directly? Hang your head in shame the next time you visit Gettysburg.
#FireGorka Mr and Mrs. #FireBannon #FireMiller
You failed to point out the assassination of an American citizen by a Nazi.  Name the names Senator&name their inspiration:Trump
I don't believe you
weak
What about saying you condemn White Supremacy. How do you feel about swastikas and ethnic cleansing?
You aid this racism, hate, and violence by supporting Donny for President. Good job you vile, unacceptable, complicit Senator
Should have simply retweeted POTUS.  When will you show some courage and take a stand on key issues that might upset him?  Please...
Following Trump's sickenening tweet of "The Trump Train" mowing down CNN, it is now YOUR DUTY to IMPEACH this lunatic. #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
Gerrymandering at it's best. That's how you were re-elected. Is this the harshest condemnation you can muster? Try again like Trump had 2
Racism by whom? Be specific
Racism, hate and violence by whom? Senator, I ask you to denounce White Supremacy beginning w/ POTUS.
A conflagration has begun, Mr. Toomey -- put it out!  Suffocate it, remove the fuel and cool it down.  Aim at the base of the fire. Lead!
The Republican Party - Party of the Stupid!!
agreed - all race or culture based supremacy movements bigots, racists, but so this antifa anti-govt fascist movement -present day vandals.
Thank you, Senator. It's wonderful to see gov't officials condemning the hateful anti-white racism and violent tactics of antifa & BLM.
Say their names! Nazis! White Supremacists!
We need a stronger statement. Denounce white supremacy and domestic terrorism. And tell us what you will do to fight it.
