@MarkInkrott that's amazing! Penn State has always been one of the highest earning DM programs in the country. Very impressive!

@SportsCenter @81PSU
@SportsCenter how about raising money for kids who are victims of sexual abuse?
@SportsCenter meanwhile at Seton Hall our dance marathon raised just over $9,000 for kids with cancer
@JoeyDeRossi @EpicSeananigans @SportsCenter Yeah, just be glad your school does something. I'm from PSU too. Whether you raised $5 or..
@SportsCenter @MLonWLXG how about they raise $ for sexual abuse?
@amartinjr72 you mean the $60M they are still in the process of paying? Not to mention the millions raised with the RAINN foundation.
@SportsCenter
@SportsCenter @espn it's too bad your employee @KeithOlbermann doesn't feel the same way about helping cure pediatric cancer.
.@SportsCenter talk about presenting both sides of an issue: https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/569975390686617600 … then this: https://twitter.com/keitholbermann/status/569999526792171520 … #objectivejournalism
.@dave_seidel her tweet reads "we are..." I finished her sentence "...pitiful." At this rate your diploma won't be recognized, Moron

“@SportsCenter:Penn State Dance Marathon raises $13 million for families with kids fighting cancer. http://es.pn/1B6bRQT ” @KeithOlbermann

@SportsCenter money should have gone to the families who were effected by the child molesting coaches @penn_state
@SportsCenter Penn State should be permanently banned from even mentioning kids. #DeathPenalty

@corbin_BlueEyes @SportsCenter @_nicka_please @dcard24 lol sorry to offend u top notch nerd it was a joke #GoBucksCHAMPS
@grantula7 if being a "nerd" means I am compassionate for others, have correct grammar, a better education, and not like you, then I'm fine.
@corbin_BlueEyes  wow think ur some god eh? Sad cause guess what ur not!!
@grantula7 I never said I was a god, just that I am clearly much better off than you. Although that really isn't that hard to accomplish.
@corbin_BlueEyes  im not the guy obsessed with water guns
@grantula7 We bring water guns to THON so that we can play with the children that were affected by pediatric cancer, but okay.
