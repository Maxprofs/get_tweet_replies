.@netanyahu your independence is based on the bondage of Palestine
Our independence is based on history, morality and justice.
Agreed if your ideas of morality and justice are based on old colonialist principles
Morality of self determination at our ancestral home, which was mostly uninhabited until Jews brought prosperity
it doesn't matter how much prosperity you bring to a land which isn't yours, but purchased by zionist bankers. Get off it
Show me the international law with says it's not ours. There was a League of Nations mandate which said it is
it was a crime committed by colonialist powers against the Pslestinians. We're still waiting for the compensation 2b paid
Don't hold your breath. Get on with life.look what Jews achieved by not living on past.Don't hate,learn from them
15 May 1948 Day of #Jewishliberation-u r uneducated!! @netanyahu
no idea what u r "ha ha" about? Give context
supporting PaLIEstinian lies, murders and thieving of #Jewishland w a name like Rothschild kind of scary hatred of self
1967 borders... UNESCO says you don't have rights to the Mosque
