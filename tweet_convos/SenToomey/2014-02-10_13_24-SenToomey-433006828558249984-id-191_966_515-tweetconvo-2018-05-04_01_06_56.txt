@EricCantor Don't just tweet about it;do something!If you fail to stop Obama's lawlessness,then you are equally guilty & should B replaced.
@EricCantor  The "Law" is now unconstitutional. NOT what the Supreme Court approved.  Nothing more than Insurance Fraud.
@EricCantor Stop calling it Obamacare.  It is really Obama Insurance Fraud.  NOT HC, are you going to FORCE DOCS to treat @  point of a gun.
