@SenToomey wonderful, now be prepared to #DoYourJob and eventually vote on a replacement nominated by Obama
@trayf @SenToomey Doing his job would be to PROTECT the U.S. Constitution from a street hustler, #obama @nytimes @nypost @ap @washingtonpost
@SteveWCarlson @SenToomey @nytimes @nypost @AP @washingtonpost Nice racial codewords there for an elected president w 1 year left
@SenToomey 57% of voters in Pennsylvania believe the vacancy created by the death of conservative Justice Scalia should be filled this year.
@SenToomey I add my voice to those reminding you of your constitutional obligation for timely and fair hearings on the President's nominee.
@SenToomey Senator, I hope that you and all of the GOP Senators will hold firm and not confirm a SCOTUS Justice until after the elections!
@pennpatriot1949 @SenToomey 
@rawlings_eileen @pennpatriot1949 @SenToomey 
@SenToomey please honor his memory by at least having hearings if @POTUS presents a nominee. THAT is what we the  people want
@SenToomey why dont you serve his memory well and respect his fight for the constitution. Scalia himself believed  in it. PA wants a vote.
@SenToomey 4-4 might not be a "big deal". But stealing 65 million American votes for Obama in 2012 is.
@SenToomey Are you open to an Obama nominee, or should the next president fill the vacancy?
@SenToomey Ruth Bader Ginsberg may be sad.Will you BLOCK any Obama nomination just because you can? YOU R NOT FOR ALL PEOPLE.Just the few!!
@SenToomey  Scran-Times Trib said that Sen.Toomey’s support for McConnell’s position is “naked obstruction” & the incumbent “should desist.”
@SenToomey where do you stand on the TPP?
@SenToomey No Obama nominee please! Wait for the next President
@SenToomey take a Civics class!  The next president does NOT choose the next justice to the supreme court, the CURRENT one does!
@SenToomey Obama is still POTUS, elected by the people, our voices were heard. He gets to nominate for SCOTUS #Fetterman 4 Senate
@SenToomey #DoYourJob or #LoseYourJob #Obstructionists #ThankyouForOpeningUpYourSeat #You'reFired!!! #Constitution:PresidentSHALL
@SenToomey Justice Scalia asked that Elena Kagen be sent over to the Sup.Ct. Don't be a lemming - think for yourself and do the right thing.
@SenToomey funny you won’t consider a potential replacement since you won’t be around in January
@SenToomey Your party has treated the President and the American people with contempt with your pathological obstruction. ENOUGH!
#DoYourJob
@SenToomey You desecrate Scalia's love of the Constitution by blocking nominees. If you don't uphold the Constitution you are antiAmerican.
@SenToomey You have failed your constituents, your office, and your nation. You do not deserve our support, not the seat you fill.
@SenToomey #DoYourJob or find a new one.  The majority of your constituents, the only ones who should matter, want a vote on a nominee.
@SenToomey Stand firm against any SCOTUS nominee put forth by President Obama! We need a strong conservative to replace Scalia!
@SenToomey Offensive commercial! America DID choose YOU just don't like who was chosen. Transparent hypocrisy of the legislative class.
@SenToomey I live in neighboring NJ & I hope you lead the fight against a lame duck appointment
@SenToomey
You'll lose your seat in our purple state in Nov if you align with Obama-haters & attack @POTUS w/more vicious marginalization.
@SenToomey so defend The Constitution which stipulates the President nominates justices. Always politics; so much for conserving anything.
@SenToomey we elected this president in 2008 and again in 2012. He serves another 331 days. It's not right to block him.
@SenToomey the President appoints Supreme Court Justice and we already chose our President, Barack Obama~ Pittsburgh Pa
@SenToomey 
I voted twice for President Obama. His job is to nominate the next SCJ. Please STOP the obvious Obama obstruction and #DoYourJob
@SenToomey #LetDonaldDecide
@SenToomey No new Supreme Court Justice until after the election!
@SenToomey Honor him by allowing vote on Obama's nominee as he would tell you if he were here.You are an embarrassment to Pennsylvanians
@SenToomey you have been wrong many times with your comments .lEARN TO THINK BEFORE YOU DISPLAY YOUR IGNORANCE.
@SenToomey Late in GW term Sen .Schumer also said GW should not nominate  and you are both wrong.
@SenToomey You are wrong about the nomination& if a Rep.were in same situ you would agree.
@SenToomey Now obey the Constitution and replace Justice Scalia.  PA 6th District
@SenToomey Agreed NOW serve the interests of your COUNTRY and hold hearings to approve a successor.  In short DO YOUR JOB !!!!
@SenToomey please allow a vote for a new justice in the senate.  Don't obstruct
@SenToomey  Appalling. I expect a retraction of your statement released on Feb 15, 2016 or your resignation. You swore an oath.
@SenToomey The Constitution empowers the Senate to reject or ignore a Pres's picks & both parties have, many times. The time has come again.
@SenToomey Don't let the Dems seize SCOTUS. The people put the GOP in control of the Senate to stop them. Don't cave to the Bork-amnesiacs.
@SenToomey We expect you to vote on the SCOTUS nomination made by @POTUS because it is your constitutional duty.
@SenToomey Please do your job, not ugly political reprimands-- have hearings and cast your vote. Thank you.
@SenToomey Regular citizen here: Think Senate should allow a vote on the President's SC nominee. Look kind of dumb otherwise.
@SenToomey dont continue to be #obstructionist! Its the SITTING Prez duty to name a replacemnt like Reagan did on his final days!!
@SenToomey Please respect the president and do not block his nomination for the supreme court. Senate's grid lock produced Trump!
RT @SenToomey: We lost a great public servant…/ And you will lose your job if you don’t confirm a nominee in a reasonable time.
@SenToomey So now, agree to allow Obama to name a replacement and have a fair hearing, rather than play politics.
@SenToomey the President has 4 years not 3! No stonewalling. You lost this dems vote if you do!
@SenToomey @POTUS should select a new Justice.
@SenToomey i believe if you check art. II you'll find it says "the president" not "the next president." could be wrong - not a legal scholar
@SenToomey yeah if you like racist women haters bigots gay haters yes he was great
@SenToomey this guy has to go
@SenToomey If you cared about the constitution, you'd vote on a nominee to replace #scalia. You should be ashamed of yourself.
@SenToomey Obama won a 4 year term (not 3) by 5 million votes. I'd say that qualifies as a "direct say by the American people" to appoint.
.@SenToomey Honor #Scalia's memory by filling his seat ASAP. .@POTUS' job to nominate. Senate job to advise & consent, not block.
Its your time in the spotlight now @SenToomey . . the Court needs a 9th member. Don't allow that to be stalled.
@SenToomey Will you support President Barack Obama nomination to fill Scalia's vacancy before he leaves office
@SenToomey Please honor Mr Scalia's deeply held principles by refusing to support your leadership's stonewalling the replacement process.
@SenToomey So true, but given vacancy on SCOTUS, we expect you to consider @POTUS's nominee in timely manner. Sworn duty as U.S. senator
@michaelachupa @SenToomey @POTUS --as timely as those in1960 and 2007-
@SenToomey if you want to keep your job you must #DoYourJob
@SenToomey now it's time to honor the Constitution and people of #PA. Lead & avoid a crisis. Confirm a nomination to SCOTUS. #DoYourJob
@SenToomey I thank and applaud you for making an appropriate response to Scalia's passing, as some have not done.
@SenToomey @N_Fatale --time to put on your boots, this turncoat we have at 1600 intends to play hardball-
@LPetloon54 @SenToomey I'm afraid now more than ever.
@N_Fatale @SenToomey --We'll see that serpent crawling out of every joint in the brickwork-
@SenToomey I swear to the lord, if you let your fellow right wing senators to stall Obama's nominee, you WILL lose this election
@SenToomey condolences to the family indeed, but to everything else: are you actually serious?
@SenToomey Please don't allow your colleagues to stonewall the President's nominee, depriving Justice Scalia's hope to a vibrant SCOTUS
