@SenToomey as soon as you give them an inch...it will turn into a mile.yoy should of stood up for OUR rights. WERE LOOSING THEM 1@ A TIME
@SenToomey Is Hippa no longer valid if the govt has access to health records?
@SenToomey   No. It is a grave mistake  introducing yet another gun control bill that will do NOTHING to stop or impede legal gun sales
@SenToomey HIGHLY Disappointed in your vote!!!!!
NO compromise on 2A! Ur office also was vry misleading or misinformed the 5X I spoke 2them
@SenToomey  Mr Toomey, this is gerrymandering & swill with a hint of bilge water
@SenToomey I ask that you to add a full repeal of the "Hughes Amendment" from Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 to this legislation.
@SenToomey A knee-jerk reaction by people who feel they should "do something". It's "something" so we must do it.  #wrong #failedleadership
@SenToomey if you have a Conscience you should resign for betraying the constitution.

#UsefulIdiots
@SenToomey You handed Harry Reid the win.   The #2 Amendment is not debatable. You betrayed us.
@SenToomey IDIOT
@SenToomey  THANK YOU for taking the problems seriously!  -your friend in #Newtown
traitorous sell outs Cant believe you sold us out...time to get voted out....@SenToomey
@SenToomey. SO WHAT DID YOU GIVE UP TO BHO? TELL HIM TO GO POUND SAND! !
@SenToomey The issue with Universal Background checks is that it is proven that they do not work without a registry #slipperyslope VOTENO!
@SenToomey How can we expect our government to protect what is supposed to be out of their reach anyhow? Stop trying to disarm us.
@SenToomey Among other things, I think you need to clarify the definition of the term "transfer."
@SenToomey Bad people won't follow your rules. How hard is that to see.
@SenToomey You know that most folks (including senators) aren't going to read it. How about releasing staff analysis of the bill?
@SenToomey is the mission of the new commission not within the purview of one if the hundreds of already existing federal agencies?
@SenToomey its a disgraceful betrayal. There can be no compromise. There must be a line in the sand.
@SenToomey Why a friends & family exemption when that's how 40% of gun crime inmates got their guns? http://bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=940 …
@SenToomey 
And your point is??
You sold out!!

Molon Labe.
@SenToomey  your a sell out , coward !
@SenToomey if u r going to give them a slip slope to universal background at least get reciprocity for conceal carry.
@SenToomey the effort is appreciated, but couldn't the act be simpler and more concise?
@SenToomey Sec 121-States purpose is to ensure criminals don't buy guns. Criminals don't follow laws. Law abiding criminals don't exist.
@SenToomey Are you aware that NONE of the Sandy Hooks, VaTechs, Auroras would be prevented with what is in this bill? Does it matter to you?
@SenToomey you only opened the door to other laws that infringe on lawful gun owners.i hope you lose your seat(obamas bitch)
@SenToomey what part of shall not be infringed do you not get?
@SenToomey We have treasonous Traitors in the White House - Dems have betrayed America- We should have impeachment - Not lay down for this!
.@SenToomey the RIGHT of the people to keep and bare arms shall not be infringed.
@SenToomey What did we get in return for this "compromise"?? What did we get for you agreeing to surrender more of our rights? Please tell
@SenToomey We were stabbed in the back by your vote yesterday.  You gave Harry Reid something to gloat about.
@SenToomey the whole problem this law will not solve anything, lawful people need to protect themselves and their friends.
@SenToomey FOAD
@SenToomey the mere fact you are considering federal firearms legislation w/ out an actual amendment makes it a non-starter.
@SenToomey you voted to push anti-gun bill through. You don't know the constitution, or u would have spent more time nullifying abortion
@SenToomey The National Rifle Association wants you to say it
OK to .......... it doesn't matter and that's sad.    It doesn't matter
@SenToomey Ambiguous no federal gun registry yet there is $1 billion for reauthorization of public law 103_159 sec. 102(b) Communist move!!!
@SenToomey Reviewed it. Don't like it. You sold us out. Go ahead and put (D) after your name.
@SenToomey Missed the idea of social.  Every twitter is from you.  That's not the point.  did yu read any?  Respond?  Interact
@SenToomey You aren't allowed to pass any bills on the 2nd amendment. The senate is not a Constitutional convention. Jerk off.
@SenToomey You are an asshole who is selling out the 2nd amendment. Prepare to be primaried.
@SenToomey Dad finds surprising assignment about giving up constitutional rights in his 4th grade son's backpack http://theblaze.com/stories/2013/0 …
@SenToomey toomy you have betrayed your oath of office. Oath breaking should have a mandatory prison sentence.
@SenToomey You screwed up big time.
.@SenToomey Here is my comment: "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED". Write a new amendment, wait for 38 states to ratify. <= ONLY LEGAL WAY
@SenToomey #2A Can you please reconsider and stand for 0 infringement on 2A. Your oath to uphold the constitution applies now!!!
@SenToomey You Senator have no power granted to you to debate the Bill of Rights you Sir are a TRAITOR to your oath to the Constitution
@SenToomey another sellout to establishment. I'm very disappointed and shouldn't be surprised by this cave!!
Will the input MATTER?“@SenToomey: Public Safety & Second Amend Rights Protection Act.The public will have days to review. Input welcome”
#guncontrol bill only requires sensible nat'l background checks. NRA can't support? Read full bill "@SenToomey: http://ow.ly/jZ7TN "
@SenToomey Pennsylvanians Vote NO to Public Safety & Second Amendment Rights Protection Act!
@SenToomey File in against the new Arlen Specter at #DefendersRise
@SenToomey two questions: 1. Define mentally incompetent, please. 2. What shooting would this have stopped?
@SenToomey Pat Toomey you are Arlen Specter. You should switch parties now because every law abiding citizen knows who you are now.
@SenToomey Dear Obama Puppet, You are no conservative and have directly went against our Constitutional Rights. Pennsylvania will not 4get.
.@SenToomey this bill is in direct violation of the due process clauses contained in the 5th and 14th amendments of the Constitution.
@SenToomey UnConstitutional on face value! U cannot change 2nd Amendment w/out proper process already set, & cert not BoRs! #sellout
@SenToomey what do the dems have on you Toomey, RINO
@SenToomey you're on the wrong side on this one Toomey, who are you , Arlen Specter? RINO
@SenToomey have days to review it? I'm not sure if I would allow my kids to serve in the military, sure way for them to lose their 2A rights
@SenToomey fail
@SenToomey You signed on to abolish our 2nd and 4th amendment rights. Are you kidding me?
@mightyduk @SenToomey I'm totally pro-gun, but NRA helped create NICS and were right..background checks don't really infringe gun ownership
@SenToomey  You sir are a fool! Never will you win even a pta vote.
@SenToomey sell out
@SenToomey Any kind of Universal background check leads to a Federal list of gun owners.  Registration -->Confiscation-->Extermination #2a
@SenToomey It doesn't matter.  You sold out!
@SenToomey  Review what?  The details are still being written.  Another case of passing the bill to know what's in it?  We're done.
@SenToomey I can't wait to vote you out Judas
@SenToomey I'll be succinct & clear - In 3 words:

Oh, Hell No! 

#tcot @GOP @Senate_GOPs #2A #CCOT
@couerfidele @SenToomey @GOP @Senate_GOPs Benedict Toomey. PA made a mistake. Need to recall.
@SenToomey I am being punished for someone else's actions. you can't regulate crazy, just can't do it.
@SenToomey any restriction is an infringement on my second amendment right.
@morgawar @SenToomey T/P liar_lied to Voters & most of all himself_fool_
@SenToomey Don't Tread On Us!!  You bill achieves nothing but to restrict law abiding Americans rights. Criminals don't do b/g checks now!!
@SenToomey 

My input is you're a fucking coward!

@Tresidential @tedcruz @hotpink100 @Samanth_Lewis @BettinaVLA @BristolsBlog @RoyalTXGirl
@SenToomey I am ashamed I voted for you. Apologize now, support the filibuster, or we will remember in 2016.
@SenToomey All turncoats will be targeted for defeat come election time. You are NOT a man of the people, you are Obama's stooge. #RINO
@SenToomey will continue to say it, vote no. Say you had a lapse in judgement, sitting in spector's seat, you got confused. Bad policy.
@SenToomey you and your gun grabbing friends will be voted out for not protecting the constitution. Just wait and see.
@SenToomey Input welcome? Ok. Where does $ come from for all these new committees? Why are HIPPA laws going to be violated?
@SenToomey you are now finished. I will do all I can to make sure your career is over. 
#tcot #CCOT
@SenToomey Do not exmpt private gun sales from backgrnd cks. Have sales reviewed by licensed gun dealers like ann. car inspections for $35.
@SenToomey A doctor is human, they do make mistakes. This bill gives no way to challenge a mistake in adding someone to a no-buy list.
@SenToomey I love the "Second Amendment Rights Protection" in the title. As funny as "Affordable Care" in another crappy bill.
@SenToomey no one cares what you say only what you do #turncoattoomey #onetermtoomey
.@SenToomey No trial, no jury. If a Doctor says you should not own a gun, your 2nd Amendment is revoked.
@SenToomey On July 4, will you guys pass a version of this horse shit amended with instruction to DOJ to est system of tracking checks?
@SenToomey I am ashamed that I voted for you! My entire family and I won't forget the next election that's for sure! #NRA #2ndAmendment
@Koolmoe21 You're against bringing the issue to a vote - R U antidemocratic - maybe a communist. You shd show the same courage your Sen did
@SenToomey Check out what happens when you appease the Democrats, as Rep Corwin did. http://ghostamendment.com/ 
@SenToomey You got all the input you need. Today I took my name OFF the PA REPUBLICAN REGISTRATION ROLLS, I am now registered as NO PARTY.
.@SenToomey there needs to be some way that a person can challenge being put on a no-buy list by a doctor. If not, we have lost our freedom.
Props for your input process @SenToomey not so much for the content: why regulate 2ND HAND sales? Is there any OTHER product we do that for?
@SenToomey you should be in prison for treason. U have lost my family and friends votes.
@SenToomey   I demand to see all psyche evals for you and your entire family! see how it works?
@SenToomey ITSUCKS BURN THE DAMN BILL WHAT A BULL$HIT NAME Public Safety & Second Amendment Rights Protection Act
@SenToomey @jimgeraghty Name scares me, given record of naming bills opposite of what they do (bank reform, affordable care act, ..)
@SenToomey   HIPAA compliant??
@SenToomey  Does your family know Your in BED with Schumer & Reid? #disgraceful
Oh thanks so much for letting #wethepeople read it @SenToomey But will any senator who actually GETS to VOTE read it? Naah what for? #tcot
@SenToomey so it's all firearms not just   Semi- auto rifles?
@SenToomey ask ur self if this would have prevented newton or one proficient gunman?
@SenToomey what a disgrace you are. #nra
@SenToomey screw with the 2nd all you want . i have a copy of constitution/bill of rights. that's what i will follow.
@SpreadButter @SenToomey The Real Bill of Rights http://www.boldtruth.com 
.@SenToomey So far, I see background checks for everything except family members. That isn't what you've been declaring.
@firearmsdiscuss @SenToomey I thought you claimed background checks only on commercial sales, not private sales. Appears you lied to us.
@SenToomey glad to see the leadership coming from PA on #guncontrol. Long road ahead in honor of #gunviolence victims. Good first steps
@SenToomey 1st Thanks for the text, 2 why would therapists report to the background, shouldnt a court decide? 3 transport part needs a stick
@SenToomey does section 128 effectively ban concealed carry laws while traveling? Specifically permit reciprocies?
@SenToomey Here's my input: How about you look up the word "infringe" in the dictionary?
@SenToomey your true colors are revealed. Blue. You're officially a democrat. Switch your party label.
@SenToomey let this gun control up to each state to handle as they see fit
@SenToomey One last thing, can you tell me why you go on MSNBC have you not seen what they say they are hateful and that includes JOE S.
@SenToomey #5 of your bill, explain what you consider mentally ill.
@SenToomey input? Why did you need to "compromise"? This was dead until you revived it. I'll remember this in 2016.
@SenToomey I lived in Lancaster and voted for you. I hate what is happening and republicans are not helping we are losing our freedoms :(
@SenToomey love it! But still need a ban on high capacity magazines and assault weapons

@SenToomey Benedict Arnold #Protect2A
@SenToomey You're not supposed to compromise Constitutional rights. If such a bill were proposed against any other civil right, it'd be DOA.
@SenToomey a $400 million bill for tax payers?
@SenToomey If this is gun rights support, I'd hate to see opposition. @GOP @PAGOP take note: I'll vote D before Toomey gets my vote again.
@SenToomey What part of the Right to keep and bear arms shall NOT be infringed do you not understand?
@SenToomey no firearms registry
@SenToomey the second amendment is non negotiable. I thought you were a great senator until you decided to send us down the river.
@SenToomey get stuffed, ahole.
@SenToomey who determines who is mentally incompetent? This is slippery slope.
@SenToomey if your child was sitting in school would you bank on BG checks and Mag limits or wouldn't you feel better with armed security?
@SenToomey BG chks won't change anything in the past or future.Armed school sec will deter and work, just like it does everywhere else.
.@SenToomey  You have a lot of nerve.  I have to tell you how much I loathe your traitorous ways. You sir are about to be unemployed. #SHAME
@SenToomey Senate cannot, I repeat, cannot overturn 2nd Amendment. You should be ashamed of yourself!!
@SenToomey 
U sir are a complete disappointment. U would rather please the DC socialites than represent the people and constitution
@SenToomey Sir, You are NO conservative...Does the Constitution mean nothing to you??
@SenToomey Careful what you wish for. #input
@SenToomey You are no conservative Mr.Toomey....Hopefully you are a one term Senator.
@SenToomey You sir are a marxist in conservative clothing . what does shall not be infringed mean?
@2ATJL @SenToomey @WashingtonDCTea - Toomey = Arlen Specter. Deja vu all over again.
@SenToomey Here's my input: DON'T EVER VOTE WITH HARRY REID . ALWAYS VOTE FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND NEVER VOTE TILL YOU READ THE BILL FIRST!
@SenToomey I'm never supporting you again. You stabbed @JimDeMint in the back. #tcot
