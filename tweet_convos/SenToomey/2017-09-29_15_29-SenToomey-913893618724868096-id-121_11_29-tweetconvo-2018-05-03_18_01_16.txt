Any union leaders in that meeting?
They will be destroying unions at the Supreme Court in the fall
So no worries

Great for big companies! Terrible for people! Good job.
That's funny.  Screw the middle class and the poor yet again.  Great talk!
When will you have a great talk with people in the lowest brackets?
Boeing was given $8.7 billion in tax breaks. Since then, it’s fired nearly 13,000 people.
Is this a scene from The Handmaids tale? You are pretty frightening
Selected audience members and questions ! In other words a waste of our time! Stop  posting this  
Lets do gun control stop ignoring the true fact its a problem
Senator, why do all of your plans involve the wealthy getting richer?
Because he is and always has been a tool of large banks.
Yes indeed. GREED

Nothing is left to trickle down when you run around declaring war on everybody. Wars are expensive. Even so, the poor isn't their priority.
Tax reform, Yes. Tax break for the rich, No.

This is not a talk with constituents. Tax Reform should be discussed with tax experts & economists -in front of real Pennsylvanians #GetReal
The plan is a ploy to reward the rich on the backs of the middle class. Party of the elites!
And help the rich get richer. Quit!
toomey  and @GOP is a load of crap. Tax Reform means tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of the poor & middle class & the budget deficit

Gun violence costs 80% Pennsylvania taxpayers more than you are going to save them. @PADems
Gun violence costs America $229 billion a year—more than $700 for every man, woman, and child http://bit.ly/2sP5x2P 
Same trope as Health Care.  Why don't you take a little time to get serious about governing.
Looks like another audience that is NOT an open town meeting.
The demographics in that room don't surprise me 1bit...sorta like his kickbacks from Big Pharma&such. He's the def of sleazeball politician!
And that's what you have to say ???  You're incompetent.  You should resign.  You represent you only.  Shame on you
It looks as though you got a real big crowd there. When are you going face your constituents? You know, the ones who elected you. #toomey
He couldn't care less about the ordinary man in the street.  He's a blight on the name of Toomey.
It’ll help the millionaires, too! Like you!!!
So the @POTUS  minions are taking the facts down to hide your screwing of working Americans
This is our @POTUS No wonder he can't handle what is going on with money https://www.newyorker.com/fbcaf552-3931-4f23-ac4e-928a693bb9c1 …
And what about Puerto Rico?
I see. When the top 1% gets their tax cut they will buy more planes. Maybe I can buy 1 with my extra $1000. Gary Cohn said so.
That gave me a belly laugh! !!!  They really are out of touch with reality and only want to enrich themselves.   @GOP sucks



Let's not kid anyone. It's the let's plan how to make it federally legal to steal from and destroy the middle class and get ourselves richer

The reality of money distribution in the U.S. And Toomey is working hard to keep it this way:
I don't think those guys needed much convincing.
Taking away protections for American people one legislation at a time. .
 RED ALERT: GOP BUDGET REPEALS THE REQUIREMENT FOR A CBO SCORE BEFORE A VOTE  https://twitter.com/davidckamin/status/913825150080110592 …
Your "budget" is designed to perpetuate unfair wealth distribution. That is all.
This baloney hasn't worked in 30 years. EXCEPT FOR THE RICH. #TaxReform
@PennLive NO TAX REFORM UNTIL TRUMP RELEASES HIS TAXES. PERIOD. @TuesdaysToomey
Hey is @LycomingEngines recieving KOZ tax exemptions? & will they commit in writing to hire more people if they get massive tax break?
Bumping the deficit by two TRILLION dollars?  Is this even remotely responsible?  And you think this is just swell?
Senator who'll talk to select business audiences but not the public who elected him.
You must not have read it, don't understand it or just don't care
What has been touted as Tax reform is just tax reduction for rich. Do not increase the debt. BTW, my taxes look like they would increase.
Own & Operated by https://www.textron.com  multi billion  business! Tax breaks for 1% once again! Thanks Pat
Tax Reform: great for fat, balding, gray-haired, cishet, white men! #TaxReform
But what about the debt? Typical GOP. Run up dept, let the Democrats figure out how to manage a broken economy.
Terrible photos.
Any comments on removing the CBO requirement?
How about getting Pennsylvanians to work? No train from Allentown to Philly. But if you are from Delaware no problem.
Save it, Senator. It's all lies and we know it. PA 15017
Wow! How did you manage to find such a diverse group of people?!!! @TuesdaysToomey
Liar again and forever I suppose!
Really?   More bonuses whilethe middleclass gets screwed....proven to not work
You are on crack. Oops, I'm sorry. You are bought. It's like crack, no?
Tax cuts don't lead to economic growth, a new 65 year study finds. https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/09/tax-cuts-dont-lead-to-economic-growth-a-new-65-year-study-finds/262438/ … #NotOnePenny
80% of the benefits of Trump tax plan would go to the top 1%
Tickle down economics failed under Reagan and it will fail again. 80% of the tax cuts go to the 1%.  This is not tax reform.
#TrickleDowntrumpenomics will not work. Tax cuts to 1% will not work. @GOP get your heads out of your butts and start working for U.S. #lies
#blowupthedebt
#TaxReform to Pat means giant tax cuts for the rich, crumbs for the working class. NO CHANGE to the tax code until Trump releases his taxes!
U should stop tweeting & so should your boss. U tweet such silly things & think people can't see through it. But thanks for the laughs
Hey. Senator Toomer. Why is it the current people in charge don't know what the hell they're doing?
THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. 

Our Governor should not have to beg for basic human rights.…
Trickle down economics does not work. It has been tried, and it has failed! They will enjoy extra tax savings and buy a bigger mansions!
Great time for tax breaks , hurricanes and wars and what not!
In summary Pat: Healthcare is a privilege, sex assaulters need sympathy, public ed sucks, more middle class taxes=tax breaks for wealthy.
I forgot-ppl w disabilities and children, ur like PR, on ur own. I think that covers it. #MAGA
You have no shame. Look at these photos again. Look closely. 

#WasteofaSenateseat
Talking to a bunch of CEO's, I see. This is a money grab for the rich, pure and simple.
Could you explain why the middle class will actually pay more in taxes?
I'm sure this will help YOU.
Please share with your constituents any real world evidence that tax cuts to corporations created jobs.
And break the middle & lower class!
Another day, another lie.  Your tax reform does nothing for the average American family!
Looks like someone wants to line their pockets and it won't be the working stiffs.


Trickle baby! Feed the rich. Starve the poor.




https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-removes-paper-at-odds-with-mnuchins-take-on-corporate-tax-cuts-winners-1506638463 … cuts based on lies
Gee, I didn’t see you. Weren’t  people on fixed incomes invited?
They're licking their chops over all the tax breaks they are going to get on the backs of the middle class! Same old republicans song!
You are delusional.
That's a diverse group there. I'm so tired of your lies. Trickle down doesn't work. Hold a town hall in Philly & we can discuss.
Your a damn liar. You are done.
Manufacturers/corporations are sitting on tons $$$ now. I don't see them hiring/expanding or paying more. Knock off with the lies!
Maybe it's going into pensions and benefits? O I peed!
Yes that trickle down economics..so successful !! Selling your fellow Pennsylvanians down the river
Hey Pat, you enjoy talking to the choir. Most of us know that the tax plan is a plan for you rich guys.
The diversity represented at that table is staggering. I'm confident everyone's interests will be well represented /sarcasm #ToomeySucks
Spot on - aged white men!
Businesses add jobs & increase wages when demand exceeds production Giving them tax breaks will only add to their bonuses
I challenge the Sen & @realDonaldTrump to make first bracket 8% n rev neutral it by adding high end brackets. Who r u 4?
When are you coming to Reading ?
Great question Andrew!
Just simply zero correlation btwn tax cuts for rich, tax increasevfor poor n growth or quality of life. STOP LYING SENATOR.
Our children need your help now. Renew #CHIP by tomorrow's deadline.  19106
Ask Sam Brownback in Kansas how that worked out for him. State in a budgetary emergency.Schools are being defunded. No money for highways.
In 1986, Reagan cut corp tax from 46% to 34%. Avg weekly wages (non-supervisory) went:

$285 in '86
$282 in '87
$271 in '90

Bullshit!
