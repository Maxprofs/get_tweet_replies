@SenToomey I'm a strong Dem, but thank you, Sen. Toomey.
@GeorgeGunning :)
@SenToomey WE Already have to go through Background Checks to purchase.Why aren't you pushing Holder & Obama to prosecute Violent Criminals
Sen Toomey only cares about stripping NON political people of rights.. He WILL NEVER go after other Gov't employees @kssturgis62 @SenToomey
@FngConservative @SenToomey AMEN Sen Toomey has violated his Oath - Never forget - Taking the #2nd away, dismantling the Constitution.
He is assimilating to his Washington DC political bosses, He and the rest are above the law.. It only applies to us! @kssturgis62 @SenToomey
@SenToomey Your Voting to change the #Constitution without a Convention. Your Act is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.Your Oath meant nothing. #NOGUNCONTROL
@kssturgis62 @SenToomey #noreelection of flip flopping talking out both sides of their mouth politicians
@astarpimpin @SenToomey He is allowing Dr's to report you to NCIS as Mentally Ill with no notification to you,& no recourse.Show me the BILL
@SenToomey our state doesn't have a criminal background check already? I remember one being done when I bought my guns. What is the diff.
@astarpimpin @SenToomey the difference is not all states require background checks for private sales..this does, if advertised or at gunshow
@SiliconPlayer @SenToomey all sales by a FFL licensed business have to submit a background check at their store or at a gunshow.
@astarpimpin @SenToomey Agreed..that's why I keep the "gunshow loophole" is myth..but leftist media is winning with that myth..this ends it
@SenToomey Mentally ill you say? 11% of Smericans are on SSRI's the vast majority of whom are nonviolent; they need to lose their rights?
@SenToomey 11% of Americans, I made a typo, and that is just SSRI's. this is backdoor gun control, don't be a hypocrite, at least they admit
@SenToomey   Not too late to admit your mistake and change course.
No gun control.
@SenToomey I thought you were smarter than this you've been hoodwinked by emotion and peer pressure. #noreelection
@SenToomey The mentally ill wording will be a slippery slope, leading to many people loosing rights. Shame on you. Tip: PA says no to you!
@SenToomey Bravo!! Because criminals and mentally ill wouldn't dare steal a gun to harm others. You must be so proud of your hard "work"
@SenToomey 

You know damn well this will open the door to confiscation on minor health issues. They will call anything mental illness!
@SenToomey You will be held accountable you lying piece of dung.
@SenToomey If I lived  in the great state of PA, I would be ashamed of u! #traitor #democrat
@CalSchoonover @SenToomey You don't have to live in PA to donate money to his primary opponent. I printed the vote list of Yea. #traitors
@dorothy1961 @SenToomey Thanks!
@SenToomey So you're looking out for people by caving. This is a paradox fit for Back to the Future.
@SenToomey 
We pushed hard to get you in...this is how you treat us! You can't be trusted any longer...we put you in and we'll take you out!
.@SenToomey criminals already can’t buy guns doofus. You are a traitor to the conservative base that elected you. I will work to defeat you.
.@WitteTweets .@SenToomey Together we will remove those from office that oppose us, the taxpayers, their employer.
@SenToomey Look what is happening in NY w/regard to gun confiscation forfolks who happened were treated for for depression years ago.
@SenToomey What about those who with mental problems that r being treated and have NEVER done anything wrong. Violates their 2nd amendment
@SenToomey We remember Arlen Specter, and now we know who Pat Toomey is.
.@SenToomey We already have background checks. in 2010, 44 of 15000 who illegally tried to purchase were prosecuted. 44! Use existing laws!!
@yardism @SenToomey yep, glad you can feel sadness for those families, but passing crap laws doesn't solve the problem. Enforcement of laws!
.@JoeTew @SenToomey I was wrong..In  2010-72,659 denials,34,459 for felony  convictions/indictments 13,862 fugitives. 44 were prosecuted
@SenToomey It allows for doctor to report you as "mentally ill" to the NICS with no notification or recourse for you. Unconscionable.
@zamoose @sentoomey Resist.
@SenToomey 2 words..You're Fired @nra
@SenToomey Define mentally ill . Someone that is on medications? That would be 3/4 th us
@SenToomey -guess U don't care-Criminals don't obey laws-vets or any1 medicated 4 depression barred-ask guy n NY guns confiscated wrongfully
@SenToomey Was it the dinner w/Obama ? Cause I'll take u dancin if u will keep ur hands off my rights. #Protect2A #primary
@SenToomey The #NY mental health commnunity protest they won't cooperate in providing info 2 NICS database, and don't have 2 under the law.
@SenToomey You're a real idiot if you think your bill will keep guns out of criminals hands. When do you switch parties?
@SenToomey This does absolutely nothing about real problem of criminals & their guns!!! Just infringes on the good people that elected you!
@ladydshops  I seem to be out of that loop. Sorry. I thought he was pro 2nd amendmant.
@SenToomey your called out on Drs being able to say your mentally ill without the person being told.  http://www.therightscoop.com/erick-erickson-toomeys-background-check-amendment-has-a-serious-flaw/ …
@SenToomey --CRIMINALS don't obey LAWS--who would trust Adm who designated VETS, Teaparty, Christians as possible Terrorist-#NOGUNCONTROL
@SenToomey I voted 4 u. But u need to know there's no way 4 mentally ill to get in records check database. #false #Delusion Check out #NY
@SenToomey Please tell us how the mentally ill, whose records are protected by HIPAA, etc, & the courts, will get into the database.
@moeursalen @SenToomey Those records won't for now. Once #Obamacare is in full swing in 9mos, NO ONE will have ANY medical records privacy!
@LadyConserv @SenToomey That will be like fascism on steroids and methamphetamine..
@SenToomey Of course this also means making every mental health record public which will mean less mentally ill people will seek help... hmm
@SenToomey Whet PA needs is a REAL CONSERVATIVE NOT a sell out whore.
@SenToomey And now we find out the pay was booze and a yacht ride.  Average Americans don't have paid security OR yachts.
@SenToomey You may be well intended but you've been played. And so have we who voted for u. #NY #SAFE Act is the end goal. Check it out.
@moeursalen @SenToomey Toomey just sealed his faith as a one term Senator. He will be primaried for giving into the left wing nut jobs.
@jbtalker @SenToomey How could a smart guy b so stupid?  Was it a rookie move?  Or intentional sellout?  #DISGUSTING Toomey, change ur mind.
@SenToomey Criminals are called "criminals" because they don't obey the laws, and they will continue to get their guns without backgrd cheks
@SenToomey I will never vote for you again. What did they offer you to sell us out?! #2A #Traitor
@SenToomey are you kidding? You are opening the door to the end of the #2amendment
@SenToomey Saying you supports gun rights and actually doing it are two different things. No one is fooled. Keep your hands of the #2A.
@SenToomey wow you're living in the libs universe now it will NOT stop criminals mentally ill from getting guns they don't care about laws
@SenToomey You are an ass. So how many criminals do you know with registered guns?
@SenToomey @OathKeeper101st   Too bad it doesn't keep them out of Congress.
@SenToomey You've been taken for a ride by the libs, enjoy it while it lasts!
@SenToomey You may wish to look up the definition of "support". BTW - You've lost mine.
@SenToomey  Hey RINO's, remember this. It is your sworn duty to uphold the 2nd Amendment.  @GOP #NRA #2A #MOLONLABE
@SenToomey No it doesn't read the bill.
@dfhall07 @SenToomey  Hey RINO's, remember this. It is your sworn duty to uphold the 2nd Amendment.  @GOP #NRA #2A
@SenToomey What did O promise Pennsylvania for this? Keystone Pipeline? You have abandoned your voters and ignored 2nd Amendment. Quit now.
@SenToomey Just how do you expect criminals to FOLLOW THE LAW?! They're CRIMINALS... FOR PETE'S SAKE!
If You want to understand how #america feels about their #2ndAmendment rights go check out @SenToomey Timeline after his vote today,,
@SenToomey. Count u days left on office, u will be voted out! U abuse u oath of office
@SenToomey I am disappointed in your lack of respect for the constitution. Explain all you want - I hope you convince yourself
@SenToomey Only the law abiding go through background checks, criminals don't because they won.t pass. GET IT!!!!
.@SenToomey Your arguments FOR gun control are completely opposite of truth. Will only allow for law-abiding citizens to be unarmed. #2A
@Mulligan672 @SenToomey he and all other #Democrats are #Factophobs They fear a Fact avoid it any time they Can..
@SenToomey don't know your facts, do you?  #GunControl is violation of #2ndAmd & PA IS NOT for it...
@SenToomey America is a govt FOR the PEOPLE by the PEOPLE Senator please stand for #2ndAmendement rights for all!  #TCOT #TDGN #tcot
@SenToomey so how about a national carry law for those that pass a check.
@SenToomey So the gov't decides who's mentally ill? Criminals will keep buying & stealing guns.You accomplished nothing yet made it worse.
.@SenToomey This is total BS from a RINO.
@SenToomey you are a traitor to gun owners, you know Damn well that these background checks will lead to registration and confiscation
@SenToomey They don't work and only affect people who follow the law. You just lost my vote
@SenToomey Not buying it Pat. Your in the list now. #votetoomeyout
@SenToomey Bill allows drs to add patients to NICS without ever telling them they have been added. Imagine how this admin will abuse
@SenToomey Secret deals on yachts are the very elitist type behaviors that will ruin this great country. i PRAY you lose the next election.
@SenToomey you are not serving the #american ppl or our #constitution #tcot #p2 #progressives want to control #everybody down w/ #msm #tcot
@SenToomey when doctors are secretly reporting patients they suspect there is no #dueProcess! & we have enough #GUNLAWS on the books #tcot
@SenToomey Every crucial vote you are on the wrong side. Very disappointed so far in your Senate tenure
@SenToomey you sold us out. Did you even read the whole bill?  Will not vote for you again.
@SenToomey 
Extremely disappointed with your choice to be a one term Senator
@SenToomey  I'll do anything and everything I can to see you thrown out of office. I am so sick of weak, Gutless  Republican politicians.
@SenToomey You're just another lying backstabbing politician. You need to be thrown out on your ass.
@SenToomey How do you define "mentally ill"? Any psych says one is mentally ill & no guns. No Senator, you have abandoned liberty.
@SenToomey You do not support gun rights.  Re-read 2nd Amend. I recall you were a member of Ron Paul's Liberty Caucus around 2002. No more.
.@SenToomey By voting to advance Dem's anti gun bill, you're basically saying "I support the 2nd amendment but..." Doesn't work that way.
@JulieBorowski @SenToomey heard of Defense Distributed?  Free people don't ask permission from "rulers"
@SenToomey  PA does but YOU don't   Pat Toomey, you are a traitor
@GOP @SenToomey I thought Arlen Specter was the turncoat not you.....hope you enjoy losing your next election.  #2A
.@SenToomey very disappointed that you would vote for this. Criminals don't follow laws. And you apparently don't support 2nd amendment
@SenToomey How much did you sell your vote for? TRAITOR.
@SenToomey here what the voters see Senator Toomey Betrays Gun Owner; plus Dr. Coburn’s statement against the bill http://www.redstate.com/freedomrepublican/2013/04/10/goa-senator-toomey-betrays …
@SenToomey When will our elected EVER stand for freedom. the constant meddling with freedom is why so many have died in War & suffer poverty
@SenToomey this is too funny. Not only does your proposal allow further restriction on 2nd Amend but also 4th and 5th! #AntiBillofRights?
@SenToomey impeachment for traitors is always an option
@SenToomey there are lies and damn lies. This is the latter
@SenToomey I am so disappointed, I thought you weren't a politician. I was wrong, you are a traitor.
@SenToomey @SenSchumer got over on you!  This is a foolish bill that will do NOTHING but violate privacy of law abiding gun owners!
@SenToomey Your self made darkness fall across the land. You were hired to see, they will pervert under a lawlessAdmin &will give left wings
@SenToomey They will paint everyone as mentally ill. Criminals don't buy guns they acquire them.U use 28actofgod to change 320 million?fool
@SenToomey I voted for you based on your platform. I'm ashamed to say that I did. Shame on you.
@SenToomey it does nothing except stomp the 2nd. So you switched parties? Or been hanging with mccain and graham? Same difference i guess
@SenToomey This will lead to a national registration database & eventually confiscation. All #Progressives want to eliminate guns. No to u.
@SenToomey If you support gun rights you know we already have laws and bg checks. You're just another turncoat that lost a lot of voters
Ok @SenToomey what about give/sell  a gun to my friend, children, cousin or wife?  Now we have to have gov't approval on our own family?
@SenToomey Bad Idea, anti gun groups can claim anyone "unfit" to own a gun. Troops coming home from war, who needed counseling, for example
.@sentoomey Please explain 'mentally ill' That is a very open description. Shall not be infringed? LOOK IT UP! What you are doing is illegal
@SenToomey WHEN U ALIGN YOURSELFWITHPROGRESSIVES,U VIOLATE YOUR OATHOFOFFICE. PERIOD.UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION! U R BETRAYINGTHEAMERICANPEOPLE
@SenToomey - What's to prevent the background check from being stored and becoming a defacto gun registration? There must be safeguards.
@SenToomey Dear Senator Toomey: while there is so much historically I would disagree with you on, your consideration here is huge to Dems!
@SenToomey You are delusional ! They do not ! You are so done. Stupid too! U had a decent record, it all goes down after today
@SenToomey it does no such thing. You, sir, are a liar and a disgrace to your office.
@SenToomey you are a traitor to the constitution. You should hang your head in shame and should resign immediately. How dare you........
@greg_breitz @SenToomey Send the SOB an email, I do all the time. NO MORE CAMPAIGN $ FROM ME!
@SenToomey somebody queue the gong
@SenToomey I've never come across a law that stopped a criminal from being a criminal #GunControl = #PeopleControl
No new regs on #2A
@SenToomey, what part of "shall not be infringed" do you not understand? You took an oath to UPHOLD the constitution, not subvert it.
@SenToomey this bill infringes on the 2nd Admendment! Criminals don't follow the laws.  You are violating my rights. Leave my rights alone!
.@SenToomey Please don't go this route, ENFORCE THE LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS!!!
@SenToomey This harasses the law abiding while ignoring the criminal. SHAMEFUL!!!
@SenToomey NUTS!
@SenToomey "Congress left with an impotent gun solution" Stars and Stripes http://www.stripes.com/congress-left-with-an-impotent-gun-solution-1.215917 …
@SenToomey No! U R a traitor and as a PA resident who voted 4 U, I will not again. When Repubs become Dems, voting is USELESS!
You & ALL Who VOTE on Your BILL Are INFRINGING on the 2nd Amendment! THIS APPLIES: RT: @1_WILD_WOMAN  @SenToomey #tcot
@Marble300 @1_WILD_WOMAN @SenToomey I'm thinking the people are almost ready.....

@SenToomey "the right of the people to keep & bear arms, shall not be infringed."  What do you not understand about that???
@SenToomey sellout RINO
@SenToomey traitor, plain and simple. You have no clue as to what our constitution really means
@SenToomey RECALL
@SenToomey Looking at all the negative replies it would appear you might lose some votes & $$$$ over this. Good.
@SenToomey Sheer lunacy! This will not stop crime. Enforcing the laws we already have? Anyone? Criminals don't obey the law #onetermtoomey
@SenToomey That is what they call bologna where I'm from. Criminals don't buy guns legally so they don't get background checks anyway.
@SenToomey Please don't let us down here in PA. I have stood next to you during campaigns and for your campaign. 2016, I will remember.
@SenToomey We already need 3 background checks in NJ to buy a handgun & you want another? Gun owners in PA will not forget this #BuhBye
@SenToomey criminals don't buy Guns they steal them in our neck of the woods. What abt the Hippa law pts signed how did u get around that ?
@SenToomey You do not stand for #gunrights don't say that you do! I voted for you and this is what I get!? So disgusted! We won't forget!
@SenToomey . . . So disappointed in you.  Criminals don't get their guns legally, do they?
I can't begin to express our dismay in our house upon learning of @SenToomey's misguided stance. We are in despair. # sos
@robb_brosius #TurncoatToomey !
@SenToomey @ChrisYMccoy NO this Fed gun bill is just the beginning of gun cnfsctn as NY and CA are currently doing. U must have better lang
.@71Warhawk @SenToomey NOTHING will prevent the mentally ill or criminal from circumventing the law! ONLY good guys will be harmed #epicfail
.@SenToomey PRETTY sure last child shooter was nuts as are all. NORMAL Law abiding ppl should NOT be punished!
#cantlegislatecrazy
.@SenToomey U swore 2 uphold the Constitution not 2 join forces w/Obama, Holder & other RINOS like urself & circumvent the law 2 destroy it
@SenToomey Your buddy says gun sense? This isnt about guns. This should be about criminals and mentally ill. That is called COMMON SENSE!
@SenToomey what in the hell is wrong with you
@SenToomey But the POTUS said he would if he wants to. Who is going to hold them accountable. That is why I do not support compromise.
@SenToomey Sorry don't believe you. You want the guns.
@SenToomey Making it harder 4 the law abiders to obtain guns DON'T work..even elected Dems don't obey laws!  http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/040213-650124-chicago-dead-last-in-federal-gun-prosecutions.htm …
@SenToomey What is making it illegal to keep a fed registry going to do? Its a illegal for POTUS to kill US Citizens without due process too
@SenToomey stand by your convictions. You can still vote NO tomorrow. PA will be watching. #2ndamendment
@SenToomey for his work on this crap Blomberg will quit running ads in PA. You are spinless sir. I can't wait for the elections. #outtathere
@SenToomey Very sad day Senator.  I expected more from you.
@SenToomey RINO moron
@SenToomey hope you enjoyed your stint in office sellout. How would this have stopped anything. Criminals don't buy legally you moron.
@SenToomey Better start looking for a job.You are toast.You lied and have Betrayed your Oath.You are NO 2nd amd supporter. Treasonous Rino
@SenToomey Unfortunately for you Senator, most gun owners that I know don't see it the same way you do! Dealing with the devil will burn you
@Sqeaksdad @SenToomey Did you have to prove that you were sane to run for office? Maybe that should be required for public servants now also
@SenToomey In the last 40 minutes u lost 40 voters just in my family and friends over this bill. Who needs republicans as this. we have d's
@SenToomey Been staunch supporter of yours for more than a decade. Volunteered for you in '04 vs. Specter & in '10. VERY disappointed today.
@SenToomey which part of "Shall not be infringed" confuses you leftists?
@SenToomey I don't think that's true
@SenToomey Traitor. William Penn would be ashamed  of u 4 having no courage to stand 4 shall no be infringed! 2A
@SenToomey why do we not trust you guys? Because you lie; it's a violation of your oath, a Constitutional violation, you should be impeached
@SenToomey stop communism and any law infringing on the 2d amendment.Your position supports communism and destroys freedom. @SenFischer
@SenToomey You took an oath sir.
@SenToomey make no law infringing on my constitutional right to bear arms Background checks infringe on my right. @Mike_Johanns @senfischer
@SenToomey You should be protecting FREEDOM, undoing all the unconstitutional laws , not making new ones. study our founding, keep ur oath!
@SenToomey you are full of it. Get the mentally better care. Criminals and the unstable will always find a way to get guns, knives, etc
@SenToomey I urge all Conservative  Pennsylvanians to vote against Toomey, or stay home come 2016 -if we even have an opposition party then.
@SenToomey We have enough checks..Vote NO and STOP further infringement of 2nd Ammenment rights or I and many others will vote NO 2 U
@SenToomey Your surrender has no effect on criminals, & "mentally ill" is a straw man. You sold out.
@SenToomey Margaret Thatcher:“If u just set out to be liked, u'd be prepared to compromise on anything at any time, & u'd achieve nothing.”
@SenToomey way to cave in to the left. Are you a wolf in Sheeps clothing.
@SenToomey You were going to easily win reelection in 2016. Not anymore. This betrayal will not soon be forgotten. #tcot #nra
@SenToomey Whats the difference between Pat Toomey and Arlen Specter? Not a damn thing! You should be primaried and defeated.
@SenToomey That's already illegal, Senator. Quisling.
.@SenToomey FYI: the 2nd amendment is self executing. We don't need you to secure the rights thereunder for us.
@SenToomey Youre a COWARD and a SELLOUT. What did Dems promise you for your compliance in the ultimate destruction of the 2nd Amendment?
@SenToomey "mental health background" Please define this, Senator. What does the questionnaire consist of? #tcot #teaparty
@SenToomey You are a lying son of a bitch.  What do you consider mentally ill, asshole? Care to elaborate?  Cock sucking traitor.
.@SenToomey  Thanks for selling out.
@SenToomey Criminals and mentally ill folk don't automatically belong in the same category. Shame on you for perpetuating stigma! @Rethink_
@SenToomey As your constituent, I am requesting YOU OPPOSE S.649.  I am asking you to stand up and support Rand Paul and the others.
Please send back my campaign contribution, made through Club for Growth. You are a #fraud. @SenToomey
@SenToomey  no it's not and you are a sell out. very disappointing from a so called conservative
@SenToomey You can't explain this one away.
@SenToomey  what do you tell your kids? You have no spine and made a deal for your benefit. WE SAY NO!
.@SenToomey Anyone can be declared mentally ill at a moment's notice. It is a progressive political game and you just lost. #2ndAmendment
@middlemom @sentoomey There are Rx allergy medications that can also be considered psychotropic. Mental illness is a subjective diagnosis.
@SenToomey show us the Bill.  We have the right to review it. Senate cannot vote up and down to change the constitution!
@SenToomey when you changing your party? Two faced.
@SenToomey Feel good, do nothing legislation. #priorities #$17trilliondebt
@SenToomey Thank you.
@SenToomey DISAPPOINTMENT! One more reason why I will not financially support the RNC
Dear @SenToomey what if I want to sell a gun to my Friend, or give a gun to my cousin, or my son?  I have to get the Governments permission?
You Lie & when the "background check system" is abused ur the face of lost liberty #toad MT @SenToomey PA supports gun rights. So do I.
@SenToomey - new found respect for standing up to do what's right.
@SenToomey Unbelievable.  Your action today proves your words to be a lies.  I will work hard to see you defeated.
@SenToomey Activist doctors will unilaterally take away gun rights of anyone they can label "mentally ill".
@SenToomey This bill INFRINGES. It does as Tom Coburn says,"Keeps records & does nothing to protect anyone" Another baby step toward BANNING
@BillofRightsKin @sentoomey sellout
@SenToomey Criminals buy 1 on 1, or steal them. Criminals & mentally ill ALWAYS GET GUNS; Sandy Hook killer did, killed & STOLE Mother's
@SenToomey Mr Go along to get along, you and McCain are traitors
@SenToomey Is selling out the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Following in the footsteps of Spector from PA I see. SHAMEFULL
@SenToomey You cannot secure #2nd Amdt rights while wrecking #4th Amdt rights. Fed access 2 health records 4"mental health bkgrd chx" is BAD
@SenToomey You Are 100% wrong!
.@SenToomey Lets play a game: If Bloomberg praises you, did you win?
#caring
@SenToomey You're an idiot. Internet gun sales already require a background check. It is illegal to ship guns to people other than dealers.
@SenToomey ... you ended your political career today ... hope you kept your bar card up to date .......... you will face a primary challenge
@SenToomey No Sir! U just lost my vote! 2nd amendment Sir!
@SenToomey The law already does this!  Enforce the current laws!
