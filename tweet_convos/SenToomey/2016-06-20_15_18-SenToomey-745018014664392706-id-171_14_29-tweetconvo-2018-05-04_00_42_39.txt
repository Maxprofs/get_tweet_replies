@YouTube delete your account, fraud.
Thank you for being one of the few who are actually trying to work across the aisle to address this issue.
wake up the people are the problem. U Dent Casey & Lynch. All losers. Washer broke u fix the refrig.
....But you voted NAY?!?!? Are you that scared of upsetting your caucus?
Not good enough.  You failed when you didn't sign this bill.  Enough.
https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/743531624000716800 … pat is a murderer , blood money
These are the 54 senators who blocked the bill to prevent terrorists from buying guns http://on.nowth.is/1aw7 
gun control control at state level only!
your oath to the constitution 2nd ......the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
@YouTube As a resident of PA I'm SICK & TIRED of excuses - get it done or get voted out PERIOD
pat murdered 49 in Orlando
you voted against the bill.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/nra-donations/ …. You got some cash
@YouTube obama and hillary will take your guns away from you trump said go after them
muslims have been banned by law since 1952. you are the problem obey the law.
Nice NRA bankroll. You will never ever get my vote with this bullshit doubletalk.
New gun Legislation wouldn't have made a difference in Orlando. Obama & Hillary tying the hands of law enforcemnt gets ppl killed
No, I'll continue on as I like ty. Go be cranky somewhere else. ** 
Trump 2016 @iwannacoffee1 @SenToomey
I am curious as to why there isn't a more productive drafting process to ensure that proposed bills can succeed?
Your NAY vote is much more telling than your sound-bite propaganda.
@YouTube Poster boy for big money donations moving values and understanding of elected officials causing the  innocent to suffer.
I will work my butt off to get you out.  You have innocent blood on your hands.  How do you sleep at night?
hope you enjoy your last summer as a Senator.
just a reminder you work for the people. Keep bragging about your self proclaimed "good work"
and you voted no. #goaway
do you actually do anything to help people? Or only corporations? #FireToomey
Courage is hard. Too hard for you, evidently.
you did vote NO on background checks and on banning them from suspected terrorists? So this is ALL BULLSHIT. #Gunloverpeoplenayer
Very disappointed. How can you vote against a measure supported by 88% of your constituency? I really expected better from you.
Nice double speak Senator! #shameonthesenate
you voted no!
WHY WHY WHY did you vote against?? Even update of your OWN bill? I AM NOT VOTING FOR YOU EVER!!! #ProudPennsylvanian #DisarmHate
Oh ya? Cause it looks to me like you voted AGAINST commonsense gun laws supported by 90% of Americans. Huh.
The election is getting closer. #insanity #GOP
how?? What affirmative steps have you taken? Talk is cheap and prayers cheaper still...
WORK HARDER. Please work Harder. We need you to cross party lines. Without new laws, nobody wins. Not even the  NRA.
you voted against gun control measures that could save many lives. Disgraceful & disappointing. I'll remember this come November.
thanks for nothing. I guess the safety of people is less important than $ from the NRA. #guncontrol #EnoughIsEnough 
then why vote to allow suspected terrorists, already not allowed to board plane, to buy guns? @KatieMcGintyPA, you have my vote.
vote this POS out!
Agree 100%!

However, anti-2A anti-gun lobby & their politicians are focused on demagoguery & tribalism, not logical discussion.
beyond disappointed in your vote on S.2934.  Happy @ChrisMurphyCT got a vote.  A shame that cowardice/lobbyist won the day.
what a p.o.s. you are!!!   Cant wait til november
Shame on you for voting NO on these bills! Your concern for gun violence is a sham. I'll be voting NO to you in Nov #Disgusted
SHAME ON YOU! Because it wasn't YOUR bill, you chose to vote no? You have shown us your ego & PA will show you the door.
How many times are you going to promote causes and then vote against them, @SenToomey? How can you sleep knowing what a hypocrite you are?
What a bunch of bull.
.@SenToomey sadly you don't seem to have the power to get anything done except to Vote No, talk alot, and keep the gridlock going.
I'm saddened by your vote today. Believed you last week.
is one Dem we should vote out. Thanks but no thanks
Here are the 25 @SenateGop Senators we have the opportunity to get rid of this year.  #enough http://www.dailynewsbin.com/opinion/here-are-the-twenty-five-nra-owned-republican-senators-you-can-help-get-rid-of-in-november/24992/ …
@YouTube Then why did you vote no????? You do NOT represent this Pennsylvanian
But as long as I can get money from the NRA What the hell? Let someone else worry about it! I vote against the bills.Time to vote
@YouTube What about restrictions on clip size? Restrictions on assault weapons?  Go further.
Here's a link to most common sense solution on terrorism I've read yet.
http://lidblog.com/three-programs-to-stop-terrorism-in-u-s-very-few-are-talking-about/ …
I AM DISGUSTED.
@YouTube hiding behind the #2 as an excuse to not protect your constituents from gun violence
Im at a compete LOSS for understanding a vote AGAINST BGCs at gun shows ??? Basics!
You mean through a 3 day waiting period and non-mandatory expanded background checks at gun shows? Shameful! #LostMyVote
NO YOURE NOT. YOU VOTED NO.
you proved today you are in the pocket of the NRA. Thanks for nothing. You do not represent the people of PA.
.@SenToomey You certainly are NOT, when all four gun bills in the Senate were voted DOWN by you and your party. SHAME. How dare you?
u talk about safety and protecting PA Folks, ban gun sales to anyone on terror watch list, this is a no brainier
Biggest Hypocrite in the history of PA. You have no spine Sir. You are a wimp and a coward.
I am ashamed, embarrassed and disgusted to see a representative from my state voting AGAINST this...  Selfish.  Sickening.  
doing nothing is not "working", senator. You are part of the problem, & I expected better from my state. coward. @KatieMcGintyPA
the only ones you're interested in bringing together are republicans. You aren't interested in the safety of the American people
BULLSHIT! SHAME on you for voting against closing the gun show loophole and against expanded bkgd checks #bloodonyourhands
thanks for voting against better background checks. You're a god damn fraud. You're a big part of the problem.
really senator? Your vote says otherwise. Keep lining those pockets. #RememberInNovember
...this is one of the many reasons you won't get reelected...#NovemberIsComing #stopgunviolence #guncontrol
When did your PA constituents tell you that they value your fake notions of due process over children's lives?  #EndGunViolence
how is working together voting down a bill that directly supports gun control? What could your rationale possibly be? #enough
Horrible action from you today.. DISAPPOINTED!. You better ask for thoughts and prayers when it's re-election time!
GOP fails us on common sense gun measures- shame
@ArchbishopBlase @SenateGOP you chose NRA over constituents wishes. Bring on the next massacre.
What now? More thoughts and prayers and moments of silence? They do nothing to #DisarmHate
did you vote no today? Disappointed. #Enough
Mendacity.
some good ideas that need work but nothing in mass shootings would change at all, nothing in these bills,nothing.
how is voting no helping anyone?! I am a registered republican in PA but you will NOT be receiving my vote this November.
- actions louder than words.  You voted no.  End of story.  The @gop party has lost me.....
The GOP controlled Senate just shushed the American people. How much $$ do you take from the NRA? Shameful.
You don't work for me, the people.  Shame on you.  I'm done with you, voting you out off office.
You care about who shouldn't be on list of those denied guns. Try caring more for this list of people:
@YouTube It doesn't seem like that's what you are doing. Thanks for nothing. #DisarmHate
if you are then why did you vote against the bills in the Senate today?
So do you want to require a judicial review to keep folks off of planes, or just to buy guns?
And yet you voted against the amendments.  How's that $1.3 million in NRA contributions feeling?
Enjoy the rest of your term. Then don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
will be voting for @KatieMcGintyPA to get things done. You have failed
"It's better than what we have now." You admit the system's broken. Do something. Even a small step is better than standing still
.@SenToomey @SenBobCasey Repeating failed view wont change http://outcome.Vote  4 #StripCitizenship frm #Domestic #Jihadists.#Congress
@YouTube You stand for nothing. The only thing you're trying to accomplish is re-election. What a waste.
and yet you voted against keeping guns from terrorists. I will never vote for you. #paagainsttoomey
LIES!
I'll be doing everything I can to make sure you don't get elected again #youvotedno #failure #OrlandoStrong
really?! Because that 1.3M you got from the @NRA seems to be more important than people's lives. POS
I'm sure the $1.4 million the NRA donated to your campaign in 2010 had nothing to do with your vote #GunControlNow
they don't understand until it's their kids in the cross fire. Sickening.
I thought you might actually stand up for your "convictions" but nope. You voted against it. Hopefully @KatieMcGintyPA will.
thanks for nothing.
This isn't about the 2A. It's about putting $$ in the gun lobby's pockets. They don't care about any of us.
I can't wait to help Katie McGinty take your seat from you in November. Hypocrite.
how do you reconcile concern that the bills were to strong to pass and voting against them? Isn't that illogical?
Bye Pat!  Thoughts and prayers!
Oh so how did that go for you because from what I saw, you voted against it. You and your party can GTFOH
NOT good enough @SenToomey. Why did you vote NO for better background checks? After Toomey-Manchin bill, a yes vote should have been easy.
is that why you voted against expanded background checks?
Bye Bye Toomey Hello @KatieMcGintyPA
Well, WTF happened?? You just voted to continue allowing suspected terrorists to buy guns. #Orlando #DisarmHate
Coward.
protecting the 2nd amendment is important but 80% of us want background checks & no fly no buy. You are going to lose your job!
then you should have voted for what was essentially your bill today. Good way to lose votes and your seat.
@YouTube vote no on this asshat in November. Put your vote where your mouth is at.
: Saw your votes. NRA may control you, but not me. In November when I vote you can kiss your senate seat goodbye. #GOPSackOfShit
I don't think anyone in the Senate can agree on how to do that
you must do MORE and #DoSomething taking about a bill that doesn't become law is pointless and leads to u being #JoblessInJanuary
how do you keep a gun from a terrorist if their first crime is terrorism?
I don't support #ArlenToomey
Whenever the word "gun" comes out of a politician's mouth I get the feeling we are about to lose some freedom.
You make me embarrassed to say that I am from PA
Common sense is defeating you The #2A Limits The Government NOT The People!
@monkwatch @YouTube Bull Hockey Your name needs to be on No Fly Trying to subvert Constitution is act of terrorism#DueProces
How is the 2nd amendment under attack?
vote for background checks or lose your senate seat in November.
so did you vote for the amendment that would keep terrorists from getting guns?  No you didn't. Just like hopes and prayers.
Thank you, Senator! #gunsense
you suck Pat! Pa doesn't want this. You should have run as a liberal.
