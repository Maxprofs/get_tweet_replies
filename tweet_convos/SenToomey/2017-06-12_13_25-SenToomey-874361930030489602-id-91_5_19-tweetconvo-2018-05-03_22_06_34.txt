WE need to see the health care bill!  Why are you sneaking it through?  You work for the people not for 45.  Show us!
"Overblown" Russia investigation??? Shame on you.
Why won't you hold a town hall? You only want to talk to those who agree with you It's your job to meet with constituents even if it's hard!
WHY WON'T YOU MEET WITH THE PEOPLE OF PA AND LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS?? YOU TALKED A LOT DURING THE ELECTION NOW WE GET SILENCE.
You won't be elected dog catcher in PA again
#ShowUsTheBill

 Toomey says #TrumpRussia "overblown"

Nothing to see here......

#TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Please also take the time to speak to your voter base and understand their concerns about the #AHCA. #ShowUsTheBill
What a hypocrite!  You had to stand among all those women and force that smile like you actually care about women's health issues.
Might be helpful to meet your constituents. But perhaps you fear what you might hear.
Hey Toomey. Go look for another job.
Please continue to work for PA citizens,like those with disabilities who depend on health care assistance.Desperately
I'm glad the GOP hasn't stripped their funding yet. Now how about not screwing us on health care ? I want to be able to retire w medicare
We would like to see what's in the healthcare bill. Why are you hiding it from your constituents? #AHCA #transparency #ShowUsTheBill
Can't call?  Email @SenToomey's healthcare staffer: theodore_merkel@toomey.senate.gov and tell him NO on #trumpcare
You are quick to dismiss collusion but fail to determine the extent of meddling into the IC validated meddling into 2016 election. Why?
Sir did u tell those nice people u are about to screw them over on healthcare? #Coward  #GoldStarDad  "Hope" U Don't
Speaking of Crime Prevention Sir- I "HOPE" you aren't going to try this- It won't go well for you  #GoldStarDad http://www.salon.com/2017/06/12/fearing-public-outcry-senate-republicans-aim-to-keep-health-care-bill-secret-until-last-possible-minute/ …
Did you fill them in on changes to healthcare "opportunities"?
How many of those crime victims now have pre-existing condotions that will not be covered by the AHCA?
What's in the #trumpcare bill? Oh, and what are you doing about #trumprussia? Looks like treason all around. You in on it too?
Leavenworth is a decent reason for the lack of townhalls.
Please vote NO on the healthcare act today. Pennsylvanians need to be healthy and well. Vote for the well being of all your constituents.
We want to see the new healthcare bill.  Stop trying to subvert the democratic process.
You have yet to meet with your constituents.
Your lines all ring busy.

You are NOT representing Pennsylvanians.
Can we just recall this liar enabler? Would rather meet with people to give him money versus his constituents. Absolutely disgraceful.
Now take away their healthcare.
Pat, you are truly useless
PA residents CALL @SenToomey tomorrow and tell him NO on #trumpcare! His office # is 202-224-4254
Do you even care that PA residents will see an increase of over $1k per yr in health ins premiums by 2018 due to your vote on #trumpcare?
#ShowUsTheBill will you be able to sleep at night knowing your vote for the #AHCA will remove healthcare for 777,000 PA residents by 2020?
WE DEMAND #MedicareForAll
Some of those crime victims now have pre-existing conditions; what does your AHCA do for them? Anything? PROTECT OUR HEALTHCARE
Are you fighting for better healthcare? Your voting record doesn't show it! Could you explain why???
Think those people could be any less happy to pose with you?
Are you in the darkness of the closet w/your fellow Trumplicans doing bogus health care plan!  Conduct hearings -you damn well work for us
When exactly did you start hating Pennsylvanians?
Stop trumpcare!
Hey Toomey, I'd like to hear how you are going to screw me out of my health insurance because I have a preexisting condition.
A healthcare bill done in the shadows, no hearings, all men.  How can you look in the mirror when you know it will harm people?
Pennsylvanians need open hearings on your Senate health care bill. No secrecy
Passing a healthcare bill that doesn't cover people is a crime.  You can't answer one simple question about the bill.
You know what's abusive to children? Pulling their healthcare or making it unaffordable for families. #ShowUsTheBill #ProtectOurCare #realPA
I am a crime victim of Donald Trump what are you going to do for me?
Well another day, another call to Toomey.  No response.  ARE THERE GOING TO BE PUBLIC HEARINGS before you strip our healthcare? Town Hall?
What about healthcare, Pat?  You are suspiciously quiet on this.
What you are doing with the Health Care Bill however IS a crime. No vote without it seeing the light of day
I'm a 19401 constituent. PLEASE  no secret health care bill. If it's that good it can stand the light of day b4 vote
Why is @SenToomey refusing to hold a townhall meeting for PA voters?
Call his office EVERYDAY! 202-224-4254
We can MAKE HIM FACE THE VOTERS!
Just heard that you won't be sharing the health care bill. What entitles you to destroy lives in a back room with your buddies? Shameful.
MEET WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS
Did you tell them about your enthusiastic support for concealed carry laws? How you thinks it's A-OK for guns to be everywhere?
Oh my god, Toomey's out of hiding and playing at #publicservant.
Is @SenToomey releasing a copy of his top secret AHCA bill? If not, I don't care what he's doing.
Even more helpfu, how about Meeting face to face with constituents?  How about answering what is in the #AHCA ? Why is this bill being ....
rushed through behind closed doors?  Will there be hearings and open debate? CBO score before vote? Inout from Dems & constituents?
Sir, you work for us.  We want answers, we want to see what's in the bill. We don't ask for much, just your time and attention. Thank you
How about a town hall with your constituents?  That would probably be helpful too.
You know what else would be helpful? If we Americans actually got to see what's in that healthcare bill you're writing. #ShowUsTheBill
how about just meeting with your constituents generally?
Why are you hiding the healthcare bill? You're not gonna vote on it without the American people seeing it right?

Proof that 1. You exist, 2. You are not held hostage, 3. You are physically able to host town hall but won't. In person #TownHall Now!
Would be helpful 2 hear ur saving & fixing ACA. #ShowUsTheBill  And rejecting EPA budget cuts. Constituents wld be happy w/clean air & H2O.
Did any of them have a copy of the secret healthcare bill?
Happy to see you CAN work with women. Now, how about forcing the GOP to add women to the healthcare reform panel?!?! Country over party!
Meanwhile, have you put your knife away yet?  Our health care is being amputated by you Senate jokers.
Oh good. Now you can get ready to fight for the AHCA victims right?
I hope you fight for your constituents by opposing the GOP healthcare bill and the awful tactics being used to force it through.
thank u for this but we also want HEALTHCARE and to see the bill!!!!
Why can't you fight for the victims of the Republican healthcare bill? #ShowUsTheBill
This is important work, Senator. Please also work for American children by passing healthcare legislation that preserves funding for CHIP.
Show us the bill. #ShowUsTheBill #AHCA
Your office staffers aren't answering phones. Your mailbox is full. Your constituents must see the Senate #AHCA bill. What are you hiding?
Too bad you can’t find it in your heart to fight for healthcare for all Pennsylvanians.
