@SenToomey How about working on some gun control? These almost daily shootings need to stop.
@TheArtimus @SenToomey Gun control really does work. Just ask California or France
@King_BaconRanch Nothing will eliminate all violence, but US gun death rate is more than 3x higher than France's. So its a good 1st step.
@TheArtimus I believe in people being able to arm themselves in order to stay safe. Taking away the right to do that is crazy.
@King_BaconRanch I'd be all for it if the system worked but it doesn't. Just read the news any day of the week. We need to try something new
@TheArtimus People protect themselves like that every day. It's not in the news cause it doesn't fit the narrative.
@King_BaconRanch Only 23% of people that use heroin become addicted. That doesn't mean its ok for the rest.
@TheArtimus Why should I care if anyone wants to use heroin? If they want to destroy their life that's their choice.
@SenToomey #guncontrol is domestic violence. Please don't sponsor domestic terrorism. Please represent more people in your state.
@SenToomey Well I am very displeased with you for wasting taxpayers money with all these votes to repeal. I vote and I'll remember.
@SenToomey i hereby pass my family's gypsy curse onto you.
@fox___mccloud @SenToomey And the "curse" called the ACA too, right? These ludicrous "replies" must be from paid trolls!!
@NuffisnuffRf @SenToomey snore
@fox___mccloud @SenToomey Yup...apparently you, and your ilk have been "asleep" for at least the last 7 years!!!
@NuffisnuffRf @SenToomey #sigh
@SenToomey #Obamacare  gave me a full-time job instead of being over worked at part-time. You must not represent me.
@SenToomey Of course you would, you represent corporations, not we citizens. Take your bribes and leave office. You do not represent me
@SenToomey i as a constituent am anything but pleased. You should be working to improve ACA. + Every vote is waste of money.
@SenToomey As a pro-family Senator, you should embrace Obamacare.  Millions of families now have insurance.  You're against that?
@MoondogMotel @SenToomey Hahahaha...you're too funny!!!! :-O
@NuffisnuffRf    Huh?
@SenToomey I guess your have numbers to substantiate what you're voting against.  Otherwise you're un-American.
@guinnessphil @turtlegirl1979 @SenToomey @KatieMcGintyPA Unlike the clown that made this his "signature legislation, he REALLY cares, HA!
@SenToomey how about you stop wasting our #taxpayer money and actually help people like 9/11 firstresponders #hypocrisy
@SenToomey Yet you offer no alternative. Way to be useful!
@SenToomey Do you have real numbers, or just a feeling ???
@SenToomey would be happier if you actually had real plan for replacement.
@SenToomey Please work on gun control and please stop trying to repeal Obamacare. Election time can't come soon enough.
@SenToomey Not that you would Pat, I can see you know better, but don't let the ninnies, like those on this blog sway your vote!
@SenToomey you might be pleased but where's your alternative?  What happens to the millions now insured?
@SenToomey I'd like to see numbers on this. It's all rhetoric.
@SenToomey The PPACA is flawed but not broken. Your claims of job loss and less choice does not ring true.
@SenToomey - Better to eliminate the parts that are not working than (not) get rid of the entire law. Heel-digging-in accomplishes nothing.
@SenToomey   TY Good Job.
@SenToomey the vote this repeal in relation to PP, will cause a lot more harm to Americans than higher costs.
@SenToomey It has provided healthcare to 17m ppl who didn't have it. So you're against healthcare for your constituents. So noted.
@SenToomey that's factually incorrect you corporate puppet. How about you stop wasting time and pass common sense gun laws.
@SenToomey I can't wait until you are replaced by someone who cares about people.  Why don't you vote to repeal Medicare or SS next?
@SenToomey it's not going to work this time either you knob
@SenToomey Statitics prove time and again that that simply is not true.
@SenToomey Would u plz provide a link to prove ur allegations?  I have better care than I have in years
@SenToomey How about DOING SOMETHING Senator?  U no this vote MEANS NOTHING plz stop wasting time and my money
@SenToomey
@SenToomey I am not pleased.  This was all for show and you guys know it.  How about you guys actually work for the people?
@SenToomey and yet another reason why I will never vote for you
@SenToomey what job loss unemployment is at 5%
@SenToomey do nothing Senate w another useless Repeal Vote
@SenToomey great job...keep pushing on it.
@SenToomey #Obamacare a tremendous success boosting insurance coverage for Pennsylvanians. You know you face a veto. More political tricks
@SenToomey wow...curious to know who you are talking to about this....obviously NOT those who benefit from #Obamacare #selfishdecision
@SenToomey What do you say to your 472,697 constituents enrolled through the Pennsylvania exchange during the 2015 open enrollment period?
@SenToomey "Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." - Albert Einstein
@SenToomey Are you proposing legislation to replace it? How will you cover those that lose insurance if repealed?
@SenToomey Wonderful! Keep after that!
@SenToomey I have not seen any credible stats that show these negatives re: 'Obamacare'. Think GOP lying
@SenToomey should have been done a long time ago,major reason why we're stuck in Obama's malaise,he'll veto the bill but it proved the point
@SenToomey How about getting to work on gun control Pat?  Stop wasting  time and money.  You're not getting anything repealed...
@SenToomey only 9 retweets? That means you definitely lost 2016. Enjoy your last year in office.
#PASen
@SenToomey if I had a dime... You are the problem with our senate right now. This must be the 100th time. Work with POTUS not against him.
@SenToomey How would you feel if we took your basic rights to health away? #NothingToBePleasedAbout #ACAIsHereToStay #HealthIsAHumanRight
@SenToomey I dare you to look people who've benefited from #ACA in the eye and tell them they aren't worth the investment. #ACAIsHereToStay
@SenToomey There is nothing to be pleased about when millions of Americans lose basic healthcare. #ACAIsHereToStay #HealthIsAHumanRight
@SenToomey it will be my pleasure to vote against you soon!
@SenToomey Thank you Senator. When BHO veto's it he must be reminded that he has gone against the will of the people.
@SenToomey what is your alternative plan? How can we get access to care without going bankrupt? Healthcare is a human right!
@SenToomey Yeah Ok, no problem for you, I'm sure you can afford top notch insurance unlike most Pennsylvanians! Tell the NRA I said "Hi"!
@SenToomey Sounds great. Now let's top some terrorists and quit trying to make it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves.
@SenToomey that is a lie. The affordable care act has saved countless lives. Proven to decrease cervical cancer. Shame on you. #votehimout
@SenToomey Whats your replacement?
@SenToomey Wow, I just read through all of these replies.  There seems to be a clear consensus that you don't represent us!
.@SenToomey Thank you, Senator
@SenToomey so, thanks to u, I have no #PP and no #ACA. Are you going to pay for the cost of my unintended pregnancy with all your NRA money?
@SenToomey stop wasting taxpayer money with these stupid repeals. You know it will be vetoed.
@SenToomey.  Wrong.  Insurance coverage is now available to millions.  Stop wasting time on pointless symbolic votes!
@SenToomey you repeal my daughters only access to healthcare?  What's your solution?
@SenToomey that's a lie. #Obamacare has created jobs, costs were skyrocketing before ACA, and better some choice than none. #votehimout
@SenToomey well I guess you're against saving American lives then since you voted against gun control today. Disgrace to Pennsylvania
@SenToomey How will you insure the millions who have private coverage through the marketplaces? #ACArocks
@SenToomey Embarrassed you are my senator. That will change next election.
.@SenToomey I find it disgusting that you would willfully try to take away my healthcare as well as defund women's health clinics nationwide
