@SenToomey @neighhay Sure. You'll be good and safe then! What if he doesn't? Will you still vote against?
@JoAnneMoretti That's what I'm thinking! @sentoomey
is just jockeying for a position which is least controversial. Lots of DCdoublespeak
@neighhay Exactly. If Reid manipulates the vote? LOL. What a con! ...C'mon  @SenToomey ! You either commit, or you don't! Nice try!
@JoAnneMoretti .@ JohnCornyn has been going thru a similar hypocritical two step as
has .@sentoomey
@neighhay, >> @SenToomey & @JohnCornyn think we won't notice playing both ends.Reid manipulates vote. They have wiggle room to con ppl.
@owendbanks @neighhay @SenToomey @JohnCornyn Pelosi's Deem & Pass. Specter changing sides, only to be dumped by Dems. Reid shady deals
@SenToomey Take a stand Senator Toomey! I believe you are a great American Patriot, please act like one.#MakeDCListen
BTW @SenToomey.

Whenever you feel like listening to your employers (constituents)... I've got an earful ready for ya.
@DaFiendR  Me too!
@SenToomey @Kelly_Evans Do the political inexpedient and unsafe thing Senator Toomey. It's about the American public, not you.
@SenToomey  That is a good step, but heeding the voices of the American people should lead to a "NO" vote whatever happens! #MakeDCListen
@SenToomey hey pat, your track record as a cons. is on shakey ground as with @2ndamendment. u need to start being a real cons.@standwithcruz
.@SenToomey @votermom Vote against Cloture period. Otherwise - you will prove that you support ObamaCare.
@SenToomey  keep it up, say no to #ACA government employees incld Prez needs to be on it no exemptions for anyone
@SenToomey no to ACA , keep it up and thanks for standing with us Americans on this #RT
@SenToomey @yugijo Am ppl are sick of games. Stand up & fight back. Media will never report truth.
@SenToomey I do not agree that HR is denying them a voice.... he is just not allowing the minority to win by underhanded means. That's good.
@SenToomey No qualifiers. You're either a "No" on Cloture or you're not. We will not forget. #NoOnCloture
@SenToomey We will do our job in Arkansas and send Sen Mark Pryor packing.
@SenToomey 
Ask Reid why: 5 Years & NO BUDGET? Really NOT worried about Debt, is he?  "Full Faith & Credit?" #MakeDCListen
@SenToomey Defund Obama Care please. vote against cloture.
@SenToomey You need to vote against cloture...we do not want #obamacare...my premiums are going to skyrocket under it #MakeDCListen
@SenToomey Vote against Obamacare despite what Reid does!#DefundObamacare #MakeDCListen
@sentoomey @tnacgal Reid will to that to save RINOs from having to vote to repeal #obamaCAIR
@barrymac83 no trick possible that we won't see thru any more! All this smoke & mirror stuff won't fly with most of us any more!
@SenToomey You should be voting NO to cloture no matter what. Senate Repubs missed a golden opp to defund O-care by not standing w/@tedcruz
@SenToomey you should vote NO to cloture no matter what other wise Reid will give himself that power.
@SenToomey You also should have been there standing with Ted Cruz in support of him and the American people
@SenToomey Please do what you can to see that this horrible law is defunded, delayed and eventually dismantled!  Thank you.
@SenToomey  If Reid goes with 51, don't be irrelevant. Please vote no and get 5 others to vote no. #DefundObamacare
@SenToomey @ShannonJoyRadio You should be voting against cloture anyway. You know what he's going to do. Get a spine.
@SenToomey Stand with your constituents and defund obamacare
@SenToomey Defund Obamacare!! You need to vote against cloture no matter what! This is turning into a banana republic. We will not abide!!!
@SenToomey as an American, u really have to bye against ANY & EVERY vote Reid favors, pushes or supports! @amspec @heritage #pjnet #ctot
@SenToomey thank you Sen. T.  This is exactly what we need and what Sen. Cruz was fighting!
@SenToomey you should be voting AGAINST cloture anyway! Remember we will be watching.
@SenToomey you really shocked me. and imagine i helped with you election. i think nra dropped your rating. you are a coward.
@SenToomey don't look good for you in next election.
@SenToomey Darn good thing. No brainer.
@SenToomey @EmfingerSScout making Johnstown proud
@SenToomey @EmfingerSScout Harry Reid doesn't have the balls to have a fair and honest debate on just about anything. @SenatorReid
@SenToomey @ComfyPaws Woah! He's somewhat paying attention!
@SenToomey @EmfingerSScout Please vote NO on cloture.  We "little" Americans r depending on u guys to prevent Obamacare from destroying us.
@SenToomey @EmfingerSScout Hopefully, so will the rest of you....
@SenToomey your wrong you need to vote against this
@SenToomey You should vote against cloture either way.  Take a stand on this!  It's what true conservatism looks like!
@SenToomey what does @SenatorReid pay for HC whats his premium and deductable or does he have one?
@SenToomey so you're going to deny millions healthcare? Tsk tsk
@SenToomey a vote against either way sir. A step in the right direction, but you're still very close to the fence
@SenToomey We'll hold you to that!
@SenToomey After 40 attempts to repeal please just move on. .Reasonable approach is to fix what needs fixed. No shutdown!!!
. @SenToomey that's it Pat, at the last possible movement take a stand so you can tell all your under informed voters how hard you tried
@SenToomey @Kelly_Evans  no bid deal, 80%! Of US thinks there all crooks in Washington
@SenToomey VOTE AGAINST CLOTURE! My sister who has cancer is being thrown off her Highmark policy at year end in PA. #DefundingObamacare
@SenToomey We don't care as much about the amendments. We care about the Obamacare funding. Keep the House CR intact.
@SenToomey Thank you senator. #DefundObamacare at all costs #StandWithCruz
@SenToomey The people of PA and the country are counting on you to vote NO to cloture.
@SenToomey Yes Senator do vote Against Cloture! Please!
@SenToomey where were you when @SenTedCruz was making his stand?
@SenToomey Thank you.
@SenToomey be brave, vote no to cloture, we finally got rid of Spector, don't go down the same path, it's no time for cowards, save freedom
@SenToomey thank you senator!
@SenToomey please vote against it no matter what #DefundObamacare
@SenToomey awesome! Thank you.
@SenToomey Glad to hear, just know we will hold you to your word.
@SenToomey why not work with your colleagues to improve the ACA instead of holding the US economy hostage over it ? #EnoughAlready
@SenToomey Thank you!  Get the rest of the Republicans to join you!
@SenToomey thank you for standing up against Senator Reid & his bullying.  TY for hearing our voices & having courage.
@SenToomey Do you people understand what rules are?
@SenToomey you should be voting against it regardless.
@SenToomey When, not if! Holding you to it. Thank you!
@SenToomey Thank You!
