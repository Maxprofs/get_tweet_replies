Let's drain the swamp. Constitutional amendments for Congressional term limits and campaign finance reform. We the people deserve better.
The Senator is a big support of our efforts and our resolution in the Senate.
So what's the status?
Pennsylvanians need open hearings on your Senate health care bill. No secrecy
What about Pennsylvanians on Medicaid or Medicare? People like my mom who has worked her whole life. Fuck them though, right?
He simply doesn't care. He drags his elderly mother out for political ads each campaign while implying he cares. He simply doesn't.
What about the millions of vets that will lose healthcare under the GOP's AHCA? We see you.
The president is blocking Vets on Twitter. Care to comment? Or are you too scared of him?
But the rest of Americans do not. Thanks for nothing
Your public tweets and your actions are 2 different things. You praise in public, but in private work to take away benefits & care.
Time to man up with Conservatives down the line! That's it; ,no more crap! #UnitedForFreedom!
He can't man up. A senator that hides behind his children and elderly mother has no standard 2 B a man. He's a chicken Shit w/o convictions.
Yes they do. U support an admin that demeans & disparages vets. You lack the courage to do anything meaningful for the VA. #emptypromises
Toomey is an absolute chicken Shit. He hides behind his children & elderly mother. He is weak & can't stand up for himself or constituents.
I used 2 believe in you. Maybe other vets did too. Now party ovr country is your mantra. Support injured vets as you profess to do.
