@SenToomey Term limits are key. Voters are lazy & often uninformed ab candidates. They reelect by name recognition only, often for decades.
@SenToomey personally I think if the electorate was more informed it would take care of itself but since that isn't the case I'm all 4 them
.@SenToomey Term limits are irrelevant. Instead, eliminate debt ceiling; end filibuster; popular national vote to elect President.
@SenToomey I'm for term limits.  The President and Pa governor's have term limits so should all the Reps & Senators.
@SenToomey No career politicians. Represent your constituents for one term and go home. The people would be better served and represented.
@SenToomey While popular in theory, we all know it takes a while for politicians to learn the lay of the land during their initial term.
@SenToomey A third of the House should be replaced annually with eligibility to run again following 2 cycles. No term limits for President.
@SenToomey I wish they were not necessary, but its time to make it so. Same for the balanced budget amendment.
@SenToomey term limits are so needed. It's to be a time of public service, not a career.
@SenToomey Term limits give lobbyists more power -- they're the ones that know how the system works when most legislators are new.
@SenToomey Can it be selective to those that refuse to understand economics 101? And merit based annually?
.@SenToomey Term Limits Indeed!  And make sure that all the people voted for are upholding the Constitution of the United States.
@SenToomey Term limits exist now, we can vote anyone out when their term is up.
@SenToomey GOP feared Dems would win reelection by default. Wrong!
@SenToomey Yep Obama should only been allowed one year! That was what you meant, right?
@SenToomey Term Limits a MUST-Without them WE LOSE DEMOCRACY and FREEDOM to the GOVT.-America, By The People, For The People!!!
@SenToomey Politicians should have a 1 term limit.  That way they focus on legislating and not raising money for their next campagin.
@sentoomey I'm a big fan
@SenToomey @KennettDems This Dem stongily favors them, along with limiting non-constituent campaign donations & level field for non-Rs & Ds.
@SenToomey It's not how long they serve, but their actions in office. If a man serves the Constitution, he can rightly serve a lifetime.
@SenToomey I would support term limits, career politicians do not have our best interests!!!
@SenToomey
@SenToomey I support term limits at all levels of government.
@SenToomey Pro term limits!
@SenToomey term limits and a flat tax that will take a lot of the money out of Washington. Bad for lobbyist and good for America
@SenToomey - term limits Are. Must have Senator. Limited to 12 years in total across house And Senate service.
@SenToomey  #termlimits already in place. Called elections.
@SenToomey great idea term limits.
@SenToomey term limits and zero salary for state and federal reps/senators. Keep career pols out, get more true reps of the people. #TGDN
@SenToomey Career politicians may lose sight or become corrupt. But there's something to be said about experience and long-term planning.
@SenToomey Pros: Cut off bad, but liked politicians.  Cons: No FDR during WWII.  I dont like them.  You could stop gerrymandering instead
@sentoomey One concern against would be what pols would do when there's no chance of reelection. Banning consecutive terms might be better.
@SenToomey Term limits seem like an undemocratic solution to the abuses of campaign finance.
@SenToomey The people already have the power to limit terms. They just need to remain engaged and educated - and also to vote!
@SenToomey term limits are good, especially for "Progressives" (Liberals).
@SenToomey I like the idea of term limits especially in congress it allows for new ideas to constantly be added
@SenToomey unconstitutional, so they must be self-imposed by state legislatures, which won't happen because its a prisoner's dilemma.
@ryanfazio @SenToomey They're supported by >70% of public, so amendment would be possible. Help to reduce # of idealist career politicians.
@SenToomey Don't like them. Too much power given to lobbyist groups. We do need competitive elections. Answer = Publicly Financed Elections!
@sentoomey I'm not a fan of term limits. If voters want to keep sending someone back to serve, that's up to them.
@SenToomey I don't have a strong opinion about term limits. Not an important issue for me.
@SenToomey I believe every type of elected office should have term limits. The limit would depend on the type of office.
@SenToomey   
Term limit is absolute essential when one observes Reid, Feinstein, Boxer and the like.
@SenToomey No, too many people be in the pension pot.
@SenToomey In favor!
@SenToomey  yesterday i was wishing potusa was one 4 year limit...ha
@SenToomey Nobody should hold public office at a given level (local, state, national) for more than two years.
@SenToomey Senator Toomey - we already have term limits, they are called elections. Electorate needs to get involved in the process IMHO.
@SenToomey I think there needs to be term limits on congress to change thinks up alittle Bc you just have the same people in year after year
@SenToomey I like term limits.
@SenToomey I agree with term limits but really, who's going to get rid of their job?
@SenToomey only for Reblubicans
@SenToomey would be a good way for an R in a blue state not to have 2 run in a prez cycle
@SenToomey I always believe in the voice of the people and disagree with term limits even if the voice of the people disagrees with mine.
@SenToomey Term limits are important. Political office should not be a career. Politicians should have to come back to the people.
.@SenToomey I think banning consecutive terms is a better idea, because incumbents tend to get grandfathered in for life.
@SenToomey Term limits are redundant, already have to run for re-election every few years. Why punish an official for being popular?
.@SenToomey Senator I fully support term limits for Congress.  Our leaders should focus on serving the country, not getting re-elected.
@SenToomey We have term limits. They're called "elections"
.
@SenToomey I used to think we had term limits.. we had elections. But looking @ voting demographics we may need to revisit that idea.
@horizon1592 @SenToomey And In This past election more than 85% of incumbrants were RE-ELECTED - the voters at fault for believing?? #TGDN
@SenToomey Term limits are very important. If the elected official is representing their constituents they have no need to worry about them.
@SenToomey ThinkInTheLongRunThey'dBeHarmful-WhatDoYouNeeds2B done2 improve Congress ?
@SenToomey one term, then you're done!
@SenToomey politicians are like baby diepers....they need to be changed offten...and usually for the same reason!!!!!
@sentoomey Good idea, but gun limits would be a better discussion.
