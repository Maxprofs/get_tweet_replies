Dogs while the racist Traitor-In-Chief assaults the rule of law by pardoning another racist? Get your priorities straight!
When did it become racist to arrest people who have broken the laws of our country?
He is a racist who has yet to condemn his base supporters of domestic terrorists,  the wannabe Nazi's. 
And #Arpaio !
Racial profiling is nothing more than a clue....you expect law enforcement to ignore clues?
Racial profiling is not a clue. It is very poor, racist policing. Read what Arpaio has done.
I disagree. I don't think it's blue eyed blondes crossing our southern borders illegally. Why does the DNC support those who breaks laws?
Do you know what kinds of people expect us to carry identity cards? Nazis and the KKK.
I'd say Joe used statistics, pretty smart
Just stop Toomey! I like dogs too but this just pandering to our soft side. We've haven't forgotten what you are!
How about happy health care day and happy tax day and happy term limits day. But wow we love dogs
Care about 4 legged animals is a great thing. But you also need to care about us 2 legged, and not just the 1%ers.
My dog doesn't like you.  My kitties aren't a fan of you either. They like people who stand up to hate.  You sir, aren't that.

Keep it in the family GOP . Say NO to #Whitesupremacy #TRumpRussia #ImpeachTrump #cville2dc WRONG. This is bad #RESIST  This is wrong MARCH
You are the Koch Bros dog...

Dammmmmnnn. 
Arpaio let his men set a dog on fire and laughed while the owners screamed. He is a monster. What do you have to say about the pardon?
Agreed! Please condemn #ArpaioPardon which underwent no review and signals cops can ignore judges? Your constituent in 18041
We want health insurance for all.
How do you feel about the pardon of Arpaio, whose men lit a dog on fire? Not to mention his other awful crimes?

I guess Republican Senators observe National Dog Day by celebrating the pardoning of Sheriff Arpaio. Are U going to burn a puppy alive too?
sure you are happy your militarized gestapo forces can kill a few more
Let this sink in & then maybe get up & #DoSomethingGOP. Tired of you doing nothing. #DoYourJob #SpinelessCoward

Hey Dog Man! What's your position on the Arpaio pardon? 
Helllllllllloooooooooooooooo???????
When is there a constituent's day?
Very cute- help to get this crazy POTUS out of office; he is a racist and he is dangerous
Nat'l dog day!? How about instead, do your job and work on legislation to protect PA trans service members from discrimination! #complicit
Beautiful dogs!  Imagine if someone lit them on fire!  When are you going to stand up to tRump & his agenda!
Your silence on Arpaio is deafening. Are you afraid to speak out against it, unlike you constituents, or are you complicit?
My dog has more compassion, more courage and intelligence than this man called Senator!
Wow The almighty Senator speaks. Who gives a crap about your dog. Bet he has a great veterinarian but let's take away health care from PA.
#NationalDogDay
I wish the @SenateFloor was as honest and loyal as are our canine friends.
Why is that corgi wearing a green bra?
That must include trump, he is a jack... you need to spend time talking on important like the stupid pardon of arpaio. What is your opinion.
https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/901503258182733824 …
For Nat'l Dog Day let's remember the time JoeArpaio's Deputies set a puppy on fire, laughing at its sobbing owner as it died a ghastly death
Even my dog thinks you're the worst.
Dude, there are incoming freshmen Poli Sci majors at Penn State who know better than to tweet that during this news cycle.
@SenToomey is a cat person. This is all a lie.
Trump pardoned a racial profiling constitution ignoring criminal and you tweet about dogs. Do you intend to be a senator or a joke? #realPA
HAPPY PEI DAY TO YOU AND YOURS!
Do you do Town Halls for dogs?
I'm surprised you have dogs. You are so inhumane
I'm a cat person. But I'm still a constituent! Speak up about the failing, dangerous man in WH. And Arpaio, the criminal he pardoned?
Are you another one of Trump's complicit lap dogs?  His enabler? Or will you bite his evil hand?
Do you support Arpaio' s pardon?  Remember: silence = assent. So show some spine and say something already!
Yea, that's nice. Fix our healthcare system. Vet bills are expensive.
How about focusing your attention on something important, like impeaching Trump!
I strongly dislike you, but I cant say anything mean about you after all those good dogs. Have a nice day.
@PennLive Why have u not commented on the Joe Arpaio pardon? You must agree with his racism.
Can we get a town hall with the dogs????
SO YOU POST THIS AND NOTHING ABOUT WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY. #DUMPTOOMEY
Seriously. A majority in this country are more concerned with the National and Global Security Risk , racist and nazi sympathazier
In our House and you are posting dog pictures !? WTH is wrong with you?
#ImpeachTrump you complicit Scotus stealing POS.
I hope everyone is OK.Just know that you are in our thoughts.Many in the country are taking water & other supplies to American Red Cross
Hey Toomey the U.S. is in distress. Can u stop talkin about dogs and #ImpeachTrump

Usually dog pics get likes.  But you need to do better
Let's talk about your support of @BetsyDeVosED ! Bad for #philly and #wealthcare you stand with @realDonaldTrump
My dog doesn't think that Arpaio should've been pardoned. Where do you stand @SenToomey ?
Why couldn't you have put the effort into a tweet last night decrying the president's deplorable pardon! #25thAmendmentTime
god, 2-D Toomey no bark no bite tail between your hiney Toomey.
Thats nice and all..BUT you need to focus on tax cuts and the Border wall
He's too much of a Trump admirer to EVER go against his lord and master. He's proven it time and time again.
We love dogs. We'd also love having 2 Senators who would stand up to the crazy racist traitor in the WH. Alas, we only have one.
Your constituents demand you sign Resolution Censuring Trump for failing 2 condemn WH Supremacists. Rs must condemn his Arpaio pardon too.
I'm betting you don't have a dog, right?
Great... ur still a POS
Thanks for issuing a statement about National Dog Day. Do you agree with @SenJohnMcCain and @JeffFlake about the Arpaio pardon?
#realPA lucky our Senator tackles the serious issues like Natnl DogDay rather than sneaky pardoning of racist #Arpaio. Law important 2 us 2!
Oh, are these the constituents who you will be allowing to attend your - ahem - "Town Hall?"
Tickets opened and closed at 9 am- pbs39 didn't even return my calls. How are constituent able to attend?
Still no comment on Arpaio pardon? Guess meaningless holidays are much more important. #FakeSenator
Why isn't your name on this letter?! Do you support white supremacists?!??  #HR496

#Censure #CensureTrump
Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks. 
Dogs are great. You are the worst of the worst.
I've been to events at pet stores bigger than his so called town halls
What's stance on senator Maria chappelle-nadal  asked like 20 politician not 1 reply
The president is a racist, there are people dying in Texas, and you still haven't had a real town hall, and THIS is what you tweet about?

Tickets to attend Thursday's @PBS39Channel town hall will be available beginning at 9 a.m. this morning at http://bit.ly/2wbSVSA .
This doesn't even count as a town hall.
@immoderator I'll post some pics this later.
You have time for this but can't say anything about our Nazi KKK sympathizer POTUS. Do your job
You don't have friends of any number of legs
