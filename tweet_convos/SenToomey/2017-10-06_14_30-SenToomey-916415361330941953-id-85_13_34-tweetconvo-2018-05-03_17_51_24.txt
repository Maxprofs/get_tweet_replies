Nice try... In the meantime the United States ships out all Manufacturing for the cheapest labor to other countries! Race to the bottom 
thanks Obama for your eight years of hard work and bringing us back from the brink.

Can we stop on tax cuts for a minute? We have been attacked
Have you forgotten guns, healthcare sabotage, Puerto Rico, & CA fires? Russian collusion/Trump’s sexual assault charges? Time to serve Pat.
Who's really making the money..workers? or the CEO'S?
The key to PA’s economy is having senators who don’t sell themselves to the highest bidder. #KochPuppet
I so agree, pat toomey is a sell-out to special interest.
And you provided dickishness
So then if u have all of us (she snickers)in mind why do u continuly do 4GOP&not ur constituents? Vot NO2txreformas written U WK 4USNOTGOP
LIAR, LIAR, LIAR, LIAR,, LIAR, ROBBER BARON!
This is your chance. Bob Corker has taken the lead. Be bold and stand up to Trump's insane mission to destroy this country. #ImpeachTrump
and clean air and water is necessary for our future - SPEAK UP ABOUT THE PLANNED ROLLBACKS - stop being so pro-Trump
That's nice, what are you going to DO tomorrow to make it less likely I get shot with a mimic- automatic weapon.
The survivors and family members of mass shootings have a message for the leaders of our nation. 
What good are jobs if we end up in a nuclear war? Trump must be removed. He is unfit & unstable.
Thank you President Obama. You just dissed the boychild president who lost thousands of jobs in the last month.
Business/manufacturing is competitive while not exactly a zero-sum, some will win, others lose.  Increase min. Wage & consumer markerts grow
That's great.  What are you going to DO tomorrow to insure CHIP for working poor (since you won't support a living wage)
still waiting to see donald's tax returns....
are companies/healthcare we still paying for Viagra? thought so!!!!
& your taking people's healthcare for tax cuts to wealthiest Americans- you should be ashamed, Senator! @TuesdaysToomey @WhatsPatUpTo
I wish he would start putting country before party and work for PA instead that pathetic excuse for a president.
And repealing Freedom Of Speech is the key to 45s success!
Yes, though under 9% of our employment. Don’t forget the rest of us! (I export software, for example.)
Where is congress on CSRs? You realize effect on our premiums from inaction. Much bigger deal than NFL stuff. Do your jobs!
We know about the "synthetic appeal" of the PPACA.  You using budget cuts as a back door to killing healthcare.  Slashes to medicare, medicaid, no pre existing coverage, everybody's ins goes through the roof, employer sponsored or not.  I guess those who line your pockets are #1.
You and Republicans hate America.. guess YOU will get a great pay raise IF Tax law passed, tell us HOW much .@SenToomey ? #WeWantToKnow Thks
steaming mad about baby trump using tax payers money for Pence/Colts publicity stunt.  jesus christ, is he insecure and an idiot
GE=No Taxes & No Jobs.  *Whats up with that*???  Esp since trains are the most efficient transport, wheres that "Pro-Biz PA Senator"?
You mean Pres. Obama??? Yeah first time in 72 months of job growth under Obama we lose jobs under you & Trump. Usually takes about 9 months

Keep the 39.5% the rich pay, close the loopholes for them & corps. Lower middle class & poor rates. Extend Medicare
Why do Medicare & Medicaid get the hatchet while military spending increases?
Suspend the tax breaks for corporations that send jobs over seas and we will all have work!
I do not RESENT rich ppl,however,40% tax they pay STILL KEEPS THEM AS BILLIONAIRES,RIGHT?..middle class eat cheap,get that?
Pat, No sure making up new "days" is the way to go here.  Spend hours last night but could find and Hallmark cards for the occasion.

You didn't do anything to help this. THIS is all under @POTUS44  proposals still
On another matter, I'm chomping at the bit for your next election. U vs. the Hamburgler or U vs. Darth Vadar, guess what Pat? Not U!
Thanks to our great Governor Tom Wolf! #MadeInPA
Manufacturing may be key today, but not for tomorrow. We need research and education - govt has a role here to provide our kids jobs.
Keep saying you care about blue collar workers by cutting healthcare. 
#HashtagFail lol
Omg yes!
Ugh. Read the room, Pat.
Free birth control is key to the lives of many women. Especially when your party makes abortion more difficult. What a disgrace.
Yeah. Gov tweeted this out hours before you did. Getting nervous about your support base, Pat?
Manufacturing is the backbone of Pennsylvania's economy. Proud to celebrate all things #MadeInPA this Manufacturing Day. #MFGDay17 https://twitter.com/PADCEDnews/status/915279111987310592 …
He has no real support base anymore. He's just riding this cash cow as long as he can...this term. Then his #PinkSlipIsComing!
You better keep that in mind. And there better be tax breaks for middle class. God help all of you if there isn't
Smart manufacturers will use windfall tax savings to automate, not create new jobs - that's so 20th century thinking.
Why is all the energy on the right AGAINST PEOPLE, POLICY? It all wants 2 negate policies in place or decry people they don’t like or know?
glass plant just shut down outside pgh- big deal with your TBS- trump bull shit - tax breaks go to the richest - terrible - estate tax 11M
What was the average paycheck 4 the workers?
That's interesting I thought healthcare contributed 115 billion and more than half a million jobs!
This guy is a joke! I can't wait to vote against you no matter who your opponent is!
What is the source of your data?  When I click on the link there is nothing but a cover page. When are you going to learn to give sources.
Give us this day our daily lies...
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/trump-just-made-it-so-employers-can-refuse-pay-birth-n808386 … Are you aware that this happened today?
Not only aware, but probably helped & giddy over kickback money he'll get from insurance companies over it.
Just another meaningless diversion. Do your job & protect Americans & our democracy from an unstable corrupt POTUS.  #ProtectMueller
If manufacturing is so important, why don’t we pay the workers what they’re worth?
Continued tax breaks to big business is killing PA. We are facing a massive budget shortfall since people like you want low taxes.
When will you hold a town hall?
Careful he will have you arrested if you express your first amendment right & he dont like it
The irony of how you told everyone how there were no jobs last year. Now there were so many? There can only be one truth.
Overall, Manufacturing has a less of an effect on our GDP than Public Administration, 1/7 of the service industry. Address real problems.
Sorry as a Republican you don't want to understand the problems of the average worker.
Putting on a vest and goggles doesn't make it seem any more realistic that you do your job.
Manufacturing... sugar? Candy? 
Apparently you are to stupid to understand such simple thinking.
Hey Pat, you sure have been busy over the past several months 'manufacturing' lies about healthcare and tax cuts! #MFDay17
Hey dumb ass idiot. Most important are high paying jobs, not YOUR  opinion of jobs. High paying jobs create the middle class in which YOU
And I thought it was Eds and Meds
How about the dairy/ agriculture impact?
The key to the keystone state is a static socialist model that is the backbone of title deed corruption, destroying this base u cater 2
You and your lies are a joke @SenToomey... see PA rep Tim Murphy for reference.
Can you explain why #TrumpTaxScam looks like a tax cut for the rich?
Here, based on prior Tax Policy Ctr estimates, is what I'd ballpark as the 10-yr revenue cost, and the avg. benefit for millionaires.  5/ 
Because it is & bet Suspect Toomey thinks Pennsylvania's too stupid to figure it out.

The Top 1% get nearly 80% of the Trump tax cuts.  Top .1% get nearly 40% of the cuts. This is absurd. 
When will you work to re-authorize the expired 2004 federal assault weapons ban? Jobs mean nothing to people who've been shot to death.
Bet that's "No" -He's NOT doing anything that will help ordinary peeps -just pandering to his wealthy donors. @TuesdaysToomey @WhatsPatUpTo
Why won't you meet with your constituents?
We dont have dark money payoffs
