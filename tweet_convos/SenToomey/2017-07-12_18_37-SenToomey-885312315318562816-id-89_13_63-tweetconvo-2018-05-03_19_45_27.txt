it's even worse than that. [insert military assessment of nuke @ high altitude here]  what happened to courage in the party?
"And by working, I mean, shaking our fists at the map, googling 'Korea,' and feeling strong. Like men." --Toomey
"Also, watching some tentacle porn. Or is that just Japanese? But not in a gay way." --Toomey.
Well, if you take away our healthcare, we won't be around to worry about NK. #SaveACA
Do all your "Senator work" with more Democrats! That includes fixing ACA, NOT replacing
party over people, right?! North Korea is not a country to mess with. Their military rivals ours. You want more bloodshed?
North Korea has crossed a dangerous threshold & we must take action. Working w/ @ChrisVanHollen on strong sanctions. https://goo.gl/gcPg6f 
are you even smart enough to understand the effectiveness of sanctions?Probably not.....
The president has crossed a dangerous threshold but they refuse to take action. Uphold your oath of office.
Do a true townhall meeting not with hand picked puppets I'm disgusted by ur ongoing diversn u wk forthe ppl of PA I alng w many thnk u r not

Russia and our president have crossed a dangerous threshold and we have to take action.
Don't you dare start a nuclear war.

Ya but u got a chicken s*** that doesn't. No what to do.
If we don't have money for Medicaid then we don't have money to fight North Korea?
Which are you more dedicated to? The American people or your party?
Killer. This is what a death panel looks like. #deathcare #deathpanel read what Cruz is stripping out of the new bill on the right.
When will you worry about the things going on in this country. You're sorry ass Healthcare bill and a president conspiring with russia.
Are you going to take their healthcare too?
Trump and family seem to be more damaging to us then NOrth Korea .
You buying stock in arms manufacturing? Gotta boost those profits with some good ole war. Toomey all about corporations not residents of PA!
Sanctions mostly have negative impacts on the general population, not the ruling elite. Kim Jong Un won't be the one starving.
Many empires lost their fortunes to war. We can't afford another. We need to spend money at home.
Comrade Toomey is there any point in time the GOP will actually grow a pair and defend the constitution?.
Why not just do as they ask and stop military exercises in South Korea? Did that occur to anyone?
Is it true that @realDonaldTrump won't press #China to punish #NorthKorea bc he doesn't want to lose his/@IvankaTrump new trademarks?
You gave us more info here than u did while crafting healthcare legislation impacting 1/6 of economy and literally allow citizens to die
Sorry we are too busy trying to fight against your cruel health care bill
Since when are you on the North Korea expert panel
Know what else has crossed a dangerous threshold? Trumps. 

Keep playing along.

Btw, your wealtchcare bill is garbage.
Getting focus off your healthcare slapdash ill thought out secret attack on #Medicaid. #Toomey seems to have no leadership vision for all
It's time to slap some sanctions on China.
What are you going to do tweet them to death just like Donald Trump?
Like how you're working on healthcare?
Nothing like starting a war to take attention away from the utter shit show here at home !!
He's going to require all North Koreans to get healthcare under the BCRA.
What about those Russian sanctions? You think we are pissed now, you better hope Trump doesn't lift them.
Oh look everyone they want us scared of NK, especially when we have a treasonous idiot in charge

Toomey just wants to gut healthcare
Red dragons can be facile puppeteers
Do us a favor and STAY OUT OF IT! You did such a horrible job with healthcare. You are FINISHED in PA next election!
So far the Republican response has been: it's Obama's fault.  Any escalation to warfare and half of South Korea could perish. #NorthKorea
You can't even get healthcare right, why on earth do you think you can help with NK?
tRump has crossed a dangerous threshold and you continue to kiss his arse
Are you really doing work Senator Rubber Stamp?  No one you represent can find you.  Feel free to fix your phone lines in the Philly office.
I'm totes ok with avoiding nuclear war so let's get on the de-escalation train and nix this war mongering, k brah?
I'd be willing too bet that further sanctions, regardless of how strong, will have any effect on the N.K. regime. Unless China&Russia agree
#TrumpRussia
Yet, amazingly, you still have no comment on clear collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign.
Russia has too, what action are you taking?
Where is your open non invite only townhall?
PAT stop tweeting and call Mitch and upload a copy of the health care BILL  - you are such a BS er
Take action & impeach Trump first!
Take action & help constituents- keep &improve ACA.
Take action & keep net neutrality. @TuesdaysToomey
Way to distract from your atrocious position on healthcare! 'Squirrel'
Sanctions are better than war.
Koch talking or Putin?
Come to Erie, PA. Tell us all about it in a townhall. Let's discuss TRUMPCARE. You work for us. Face your constituents. #trumpcarekills
The time has passed for sanctions. Trump should show his true might and wage a merciless war.
Honestly,the @SenateGOP and yourself are much more dangerous to the American people than NK..
Do we still have a CIA?!
Trump will moot whatever you do with reckless comments and tweets.
What about Russia dangerously meddling in our election?  Do we have to do something about that? Or not if it's beneficial to GOP?
What are you doing about the Russian government influencing our elections to get their candidate in office? #ImpeachTrump

Good thing our imbecilic POTUS will make sure to screw up whatever you work on.
While you're at it, stronger Russia sanctions too please. Should go without saying but, well...
those have worked so well before!
Cool. When's the town hall to talk about this work, and health care? We would love to hear your thoughts in a free fair and open setting.
Senator Toomey, North Korea is unlikely to do as much damage to this country as the "healthcare" bill you wrote will.
If Toomey had open town halls, he would be able to hear how the $800 billion Medicaid cut he proposed impacts PA
Toomey's wheelchair-bound constituents stopped by police as he holds closed town hall on TV. @SenToomey @abc27 
Speaking of dangerous thresholds, what's your tolerance for #treason? #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Yes we need diplomacy. We do not need to risk millions of lives so some weapons manufactures get corporate welfare.
Plus I live in South Korea and don't want to die because a sock puppet like you says something must be done lol
And to be perfectly honest, this a naked political diversion from healthcare. we aren't letting you off the hook. In fact I'm calling now.
Hey everybody else can call too! 202-224-4254 is Toomey's DC office, tell him I said hi!
Sanctions are not actions if you don’t have Chinese support

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

The push for a bipartisan repair of the ACA grew over July recess. This week, we must fight to hold onto it.

Nuke them first!
You guys know that they just hack into banks and take the money they want, right? Might as well sanction Mars.
