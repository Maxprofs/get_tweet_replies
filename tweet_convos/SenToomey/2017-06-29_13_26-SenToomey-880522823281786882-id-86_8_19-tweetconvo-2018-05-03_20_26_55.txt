The only leadership I've seen from Toomey is his DeVos support and on cutting Medicaid
Clearly you don"t give a crap about your constituents. As evidenced by the GOP health care bill.
How about you vote no for the horrible Healtcare bill that would limit opiod treatment
How about meeting with your constituents next?
What could you possibly know about saving lives! Your support of the GOP Healthcare Bill
"It's a distraction. It starts to undermine his ability to get the agenda done." Like decimating health care and giving tax break 2 the rich
Hey Sir will you be calling out the POTUS or still continue to show your cowardice? #coward. #GOLDSTARDAD
You're pushing taking away Medicaid expansion! You are not for saving access to Medicaid. Twisted logic
Do you condemn Trump's tweets on a female journalist as unacceptable behavior from a president or do you continue to support him?
Btw. 25th Amendment Section 4. Its there for a reason.
Except every expert that has looked at your bill says the only saving is the bank accounts of the rich.
#GOPHealthcareIsMurder
How about discussing a withdrawal of support for that horrible person masquerading as president. When is enough, enough? @SenToomey
Hey how about condemning your great leader on his debasing tweets this AM and his bringing shame to the office of the presidency?!
Pat, what would you know about saving Medicaid?
Maybe you should talk about maternity care instead oh wait you don't give a shit
More Republican lies. Save Medicaid means Fitbit and save $ 4 rich patrons.
Are you kidding? You're literally the guy writing the bill to kill Medicaid. What kind of 1984 newspeak bullshit is this?
The only thing worse than your bad decisions is listening to you justify your bad decisions.  Enjoy your last term!
Let's see if you continue your lies and support of a con man
Get rid of MEDICAID!!!
Stop trumpcare.
jake, how about seeing if you can get Toomey to commit to a public town hall this weekend in PA.
@jaketapper PA is counting on you to ask the questions we can't because @SenToomey doesn't hold town halls! #NoBCRA
I'm so glad your available to spew your lies to the press- how about spending time with your constituents? Afraid?
#doyourjob #answeryourphone #YouRepUs distance yourself from Trump now.
"saving @MedicaidGov":
In the Vietnam war, they said that they had to destroy the village in order to save it.  
Please stop doing that!
You make me sick to my stomach. You have absolutely no right to discuss opioid treatment.
Watched it & now I understand y u dodge town halls, ur a horrible liar, call tRump maybe he can give u private lessons #shame #NoToomeyCare
So that's why you're in favor of #TrumpCare that cuts Health treatment agains opioids? #NoCutsToMedicaid #Medicaid
U said "free marketplace to discover ever-better ways to deliver services” on CBS FN. Wrong will revert pre-ACA/have bought my own since 98
ACA "failing" as GOP wouldn't allow any fixes past 7 yrs & refused to fully fund $ owed to insurers as promised if losses exceeded actuary.
Did you also give the dates and locations of the in-person Town Hall meetings you will host over your recess next week?!
Did you go back and rethink the healthcare bill?
You mean how OTHER people (inc. your constituents) are trying to save @MedicaidGov from being gutted via #BCRA, which you helped draft?
As health care protesters are being arrested outside your offices.
How about sitting down with your constituents? #SaveOurCare
Saving what exactly w/ Medicaid? it sure ain't abt saving people's lives. Oh right,the only thing that matters to you-$ for the ultra rich.
If you truly believe your "healthcare" bill helps Pennsylvanians you really do need to resign.
Don't throw Obamacare out fix it please
Why don't you discuss how you are trying to push a healthcare bill that will hurt millions of Americans? #HealthcareBill #Wealthcare
Transferring Medicaid "risk, responsibility, and cost to the states" is attack on #WeThePeople. .@GOP  spreading #KS like gov failure to all
When Rp or Tramp starts talking States Rights they are messaging Rp Governors giving them the option to deny constituents services needed
Repeal the GOP bill
Absolutely no comment on trump twitter problems
Save? I think you mean rape and pillage.
On @CNN, Toomey sits down with @JakeTapper to lie about health care.
Pat have a town hall
Did you bother to sit with a doctor who deals in opioid addiction? Most come from Rx meds. Medical marijuana is the best way to help.
Is this Opposite Day? You literally are cutting Medicaid funding that includes opiod treatment! Please stop talking till u hold a Town Hall
You better vote no to the Republican bill u helped create. I live in Lancaster Pa and I am telling u bad idea to vote yes
PAT YOU ARE PATHETIC TRUMPCAREKILLS
Did you talk about the tens of millions that you want to throw off of health insurance?
You are my Senator and I am sick of trump and sick of your scam on health care.   You lost my vote
Jake, we're counting on you to be tough and call out his lies. @jaketapper
I missed it!!! What happened?
why does someone who hates Pennsylvania as much as you represent it's people?
$$$?
Coming up on CNN, watch me lie for 9 consecutive minutes!!
The @POTUS interrupted a speech on energy just to slag off CNN. How do you continue to stand by him?
By 'saving' you mean saving Medicaid $ by cutting off people who lack personal responsibility for their addiction, right?
Wait. "Save Medicaid "after you helped craft the bill that will take it away over time?  We really are in the post truth era.   Liar.
This would be worth watching ... if ANY of us in PA actually trusted you.
AMEN!
Sen Toomey , stand up and be a man by not backing our embarrassment in chief .
Opioids are yuk
Are you strengthening and expanding Obamacare??? Awesome!
Sit down with your constituents. MIA POS

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12

A stunning pair of charts of the CBO report from my colleague @alv9n

Center for American Progress has broken down the Senate bill's Medicaid losses for vets by state, based on the CBO: http://ampr.gs/2sjDZOO

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
Ok... I'll watch it...
