What do SENIOR CITIZENS use in Nursing HOMES to pay for it ? Most states use MEDICAID to pay for parts of Nursing home - care so expensive
Baloney. Many nursing homes are barely staying around now. Your side just wants them OUT of business. Libertarian Values = HUMANS r NO VALUE
Toomey sticks 2 talking points which avoid telling the truth about the bill. When it passes their base will finally understand what it costs
Toomey is a bum.
Liar.
Delusional patsy or shameless liar?  Which is it sir?
You're an immoral liar who'll be directly responsible for more American suffering and deaths than any terror group #ToomeyLiesMatter
Are you like really committed to having a bunch of sick poor people and a crashed economy being your legacy? What history remembers you for?
So PAT is against MEDICAID ? His state has 12.6 MILLION people - many are ELDERLY in NURSING HOMES who USE MEDICAID !
Having lived in his district and watched him lie since 1999, I'd sooner kiss a snake than believe him now.
does this bill eliminate insurance funding for any erectile disfunction drugs?  Any attack on women's health care must be met by one on mens

STOP LYING
Sure will once the state's assume most of the responsibility as the feds pass the costs - but permanent until 2026?
Exactly the opposite. Liar.
Looks like Trump has shown republicans you can lie and people will believe it or not care as long as their team wins, except we all lose
Wat a dam lier.Just like his phukin boss
If we don't vote out the Rs the America we love will be history. Trump only wants to be and let his Cabinet do the workT we knowUR ignorant
Shame on you and your lies.
Toomey goes against most of his constituents. Even (R) PA House members voted NO! Toomey wants to give tax breaks to rich, and let ppl die
Everyone else says the new bill reduces Medicaid. So who is lying? Toomey cares about repeal/replace, not people. Most in PA like OCare.

Hot off the press! The Senate Health Reform Bill Slashes #Medicaid Severely. See new PPI blog: http://bit.ly/2sz08fh  
Do you think we believe that crap.
The killer bill must die, or people will.
@SenToomey has no conscience.  He's bought and playedby Koch Brothers and Insurance companies.  Big bucks rubber stamp Toomey.  PA says NO
No he should just STOP phukin lieing
Liar!
Nice stenography. @SenToomey lied. The states cant support the extra costs being thrown on their shoulders.
How
Pants on fire
@SenToomey What was the co-pay on having your conscience removed?
Wow.  Like @SenCoryGardner you out right lie with a straight face.  Koch brother tool. No values, morals, or humanity.
By By Pat no one is sad to see you go
Why are the no healthcare professional make health decisions?
@SenToomey But then cut the actual funding. That's like "codifying" my job while cutting my salary.
While eliminating its funding?
You realize that this is in no way true?! I know you are trying to defend the indefensible, but please stop lying!
Toomey has a hard time with the truth
Outright lie and you know it!  Go repent to the Pope!
This is a bold faced lie.
Maybe don't tweet out your guest's false statement as though it were true? Or without identifying it as false?
This is an outright lie
I live in CA. My state generates a surplus. We'll survive TrumpCare, but many Red states will not be able to cover the shrunken Medicaid.
Doesn't matter what he says...the bill doesn't say that.  Stop reporting  misleading quotes.
It doesnt seem to read that way....
Another liar we can add to the list.  Any insurance stocks in his portfolio?
Senator Toomey is blatantly lying.
@SenToomey Pat Toomey is a Freaking liar, I thought he was better than this. Remember him and don't forget what he is doing!!
@SenToomey Lying liars lie.
so why is a 900B reduction being reported, that much waste in current system
In other news, Toomey lies his ass off
You smirk at the idea of the thousands who will die. Killing the ACA will probably kick us all into a recession, too. You rich parasite!
Mr. Toomey you are lying and have sold out your constituents.
Using codified and other words don't make it true. I imagine  PA people already know you lie with a straight face?
Please tell me you're not really this stupid.
Pay to Play Toomey bad for PA!
This is a lie
@SenToomey is lying! U were paid $300,000+from insurance companies to be elected in order for u to return their money by this horrific plan
I call B.S.
@SenToomey we are not blind. We can read. Stop lying to your constituents.
Fact-check: The GOP bill ends funding for Medicaid expansion in 2024, and bill’s additional cuts projected to reduce coverage for millions.
Show us... discuss this with us... SCHEDULE A TOWN HALL!!!
He won't...Oh, he has these "online Townhall BS" with an hour notice! total BS...Is he afraid of PA us people? We just want the truth! 15739
Roskam in #IL06 does the same thing.
Senator Pat Toomey has decided to LIE to the people of Pennsylvania.
@SenToomey I read the bill.  Pat Toomey lies
LIAR
Gee, Pat, I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.
Oh, and liars.
Fact-check: The GOP bill ends funding for Medicaid expansion in 2024, and bill’s additional cuts projected to reduce coverage for millions.
In two different sentences you said the expansion would be reduced over 8 years and then that it would be maintained or increased.  Which?
Who pays Toomey's health care
Enjoy yourself because someone will take your seat!
"... falsely says bill..." 

Fixed it for you.
Yes!!! I don't know why they didn't say that
Um, NO? Page 37, section 126. 
@SenToomey can say the sky is red, but it damn sure isn't.
Stop printing misleading information.

Tired of people fighting for their lives & access to care being labeled hysterical? I am.

Here's what I think...
I can't wait to vote against you.  You are a liar and are destroying my home state.

And you immediately corrected him, right? Because you're journalists and your job is not to let pols make erroneous claims on your show?
How do you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning? You know the cuts are bad b/c you wouldn't lie about them if not.
Nothing is permanent, especially in politics
Until it doesn't. SHAMEFUL! #Medicaid
BS. He's a douche boat.
You know this isn't true. Please do not do this!
More smoke & mirrors by the GOP who will destroy social safety net for the working poor, disabled, and elderly--only to give more $ to rich.
I so wish you were exaggerating, but every word you said is true, @TimbrookTalk
The truth: Republicans happily target the poor and sick!
@SenToomey Would someone please read the bill to him since he's obviously too lazy to read it.
Flat out lie.  He's one of the biggest recipients of $ from pharma and insurance industry.  Works for them, not us.
Lies!!! It guts Medicaid!!
Then he won't mind letting some non-partisan experts take a look and confirm this...
LIAR. Moves the funding to the states. Unfunded mandate.
Just because you said it doesn't make it true Lyin' Pat.
Lyin' Pat's pants are on fire but that's nothing new.
Liar
Lying Pat is all over th Koch Bros agenda today - when's the town hall?  Afraid?  #weaksauce
And no follow up by @johndickerson to challenge this lie??
Context. It is irresponsible of Face the Nation to just let this obsifcation stand
LIES LIES and MORE DARN TOOMEY LIES !KOCH  ALERT ! KOCH ALERT ! 
This is a lie.
Why @SenToomey hides from his constituents. When you have to lie, cheat, and steal, there's something wrong with your politics.
@SenToomey taking a page from the propaganda machine in the WH. PA is worse off with you as our representation. #TrumpCareKills
.@SenToomey - as one of the 13 on #trumpcare you should know what you've said isn't correct - perhaps you should read the bill-
Toomey you lie just as bad as Trump. This is your last term in office!
@SenToomey you lie! try being a real Senator,real human being,and not a Donald Trump lick-spittle..you know, take a page from @SenBobCasey
Codify is GOP speak for "gut and illuminate."
Obamacare is still in place, that's the problem. Do you really want the federal government trying too take care of you look at the VA!
What perverted logic! You are *destroying* Medicaid-- veterans, special needs kids, elderly.  How dare you make it look like a gift?!
OMG. So, so many lies. Geisinger will screw everyone. They have a D- from the BBB! Keep lying to yourself and us in PA.
Don't believe him, he's my senator and lies to his constituents
And it's not your job to fact-check him, right?
It will codify and make permanent the expansion by phasing out and ending the expansion.  Typical Toomey. Will claim he didn't lie.
Most troubling thing he said is that "this is just a first step" to reassure conservatives that don't think the bill goes far enough.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
Liar!! We can read!! How does @FaceTheNation not call this bullshit out?!?
This is the part where they cut Medicaid even more than the House bill. 
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA....::deep breath::...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Senator, that is not a good thing. Medicaid provides inferior health insurance.
Hahaha, does he think we haven't read it? We're not as uninformed as he thinks we are. #ToomeyTheTool
Sadly he was just reelected
English please.
Isn't it already 'codified'?
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Police drag away protesters, some in wheelchairs, outside of Sen. McConnell's office after draft of Senate health care bill is revealed 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
@giff18 it must be Opposite Day!!!
Uh, no. That is a lie.
Did he really read it? Maybe he's dyslexic
And I'm guessing he was allowed to get away with this brazen lie.
Horseshit. I'll be calling your office tomorrow, @SenToomey.
This is a lie, right?
Bald faced lie
