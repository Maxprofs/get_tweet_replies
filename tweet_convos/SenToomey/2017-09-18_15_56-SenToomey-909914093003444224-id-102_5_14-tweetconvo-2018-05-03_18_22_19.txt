Congratulations. You're consistently inconsistent. You finally do something good. Great. Now, vote NO!  #GrahamCassidy #TooMuchForToomey
As a constituent from 15642, I am asking you to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy - PA deserves BETTER healthcare, not worse!
As a PA-11 constituent, I am more concerned about your vote on the Cassidy-Graham bill. PA says NO! Have a Town Hall & WE could tell you!!
Time to start a recall?
Protect the healthcare of your constituents.  The Affordable Care Act must stand.  GrahamCassidy must not become law.  What is your opinion?
ACA is garbage and has hurt the American people! Repeal it. Don't replace it
The ACA saved my life.  It was there when I needed it.  I have preexisting conditions and the insurance companies were turning me down.
ACA has done WAY more damage than good. Repeal it NOW


You seem to care about protecting Americans until it comes to what actually keeps them alive - healthcare. VOTE NO TO GRAHAM-CASSIDY
Your statement? Ya right.. More like the corporations who you pimp for.
If GrahamCassidy passes most if not all who voted for it will not be reelected but many will die as it does not cover preexisting conditions
Do you even care about ordinary Pennsylvanians?
Other than the fact our defense needs an overhaul to remove most pet projects for those o.c. republicans. You only agree with bad ideas
You cut military members Housing allowance! Terrible vote, you won't get my vote
Vote NO on healthcare bill without CBO score.
Haven't seen your statement on CassidyGraham yet? Have you explained to your voters how this bill takes $$$ from PA?
How Graham-Cassidy redistributes federal money

By the way if you agree with a racist and bigot in chief, doesn't that make you a racist and bigot by association? #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist
#eatadick
No on #GrahamCassidy! This will affect many veterans that you so called care about. Sad that you were bought/paid for.
Thank you.
But Sen why are you back to supporting repeal/replace? Is to protect vets as well. All need access to care.
How about using some of those billions on health care for veterans, COWARD?
What about health care As a HUMAN You can't vote for #GrahamCassidy crime I know you can't cuz you are a real man not a criminal God bless
#RealPA from 19125 who wants you to make your stance on #GrahamCassidy CLEAR to us, your bosses,  & for that stance to be resoundingly NO!
Are you planning on an invasion from outer space?
NDAA shows ignorance/ lack of concern of Congress. What we need is infrastructure/not obscene piles of tax $$ 4 weapons, special ops, & war.
Giving more $ to Penatagon than they requested while gutting healthcare formiddle class and poor; meanwhile your office phones go unanswered
You know GrahamCassidy will mean many vets will lose health care, right? You say you care about the military: SHOW IT. (Hold a town hall.)
That same bill sec 603 cuts military housing allowance! He does not like the military! FACTS!
vote no on #GrahamCasiddy
Vote NO on the GOP Healthcare bill and maybe I'll be impressed.

What your vote on healthcare?  Of course we know it is to take care away from 32 million.  I'm sure you are dancing in the hall. Out you go
I either have to pay a crazy monthly premium and extremely high deducts or get "taxed" aka fined for not buying in
I casted my vote FOR YOU to repeal this bs aca im sick of being forced to buy a good or service
LULZ. @toomeyregrets
Are you forced to purchase aca?
You aren't forced to buy it. Just pay the penalty. 
Yeah so you buy this service or pay a penalty aka forced in some way shape or form you're paying for it
The gov't forces everyone do. Big whoop.
So I'll take that as a no you don't
Do you want to know the CBO score on health bill before you vote? If you have any conscience you'll vote NO! It'll hurt not help. Watching!
Lol. Toomey with a conscience.
Good job, glad to see your doing something besides twiddling your thumbs.
You are touting your bipartisan approach to NDAA, sponsoring amendments with @SenBobCasey. Please join him on opposing #GrahamCassidy, too.
I did not how we were going to rely on the Russians for power for European bases, are you suggesting they go solar? Or are you selling coal?
My family and I are scared that you will take away access to healthcare. Please fix, don't destroy ACA.
Vote no on Graham/Cassidy.

without CBO score on coverage no senator should vote on this mess http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/351215-cbo-aims-to-release-limited-analysis-of-obamacare-repeal-bill-next-week#.WcAmzf_8SGs.twitter …

PA would lose $850 million in funding under #GrahamCassidyBill. This is unacceptable! Vote NO!
Vote #noGrahamCassidy . Listen to your constituents, the ones who you're supposed to serve, who are paying your salary (& your insurance).
aka an extra $700 billion to kill more brown people
We can afford mindless endless war but not health care of course
But you and @SenBobCasey voted to table the AUMF conversation, because you like sending sons and daughters to war for two decades w/o plan?
Regular order, shithead.
The National Defense is by La Reina and Pentagone.Reagan.Lady Oscar.Steve
Just wait for when your GOP constituency loses healthcare Pat, then you'll have no places to visit!
Fiscal responsibility only matters when I get to screw as many citizens as possible. Never when it comes to a bloated DOD
What will you say to babies w/birth defects? People w/pre-existing conds? Disabilities? Medicaid recipients? #SaveACA
#NoGrahamCassidy
I don't know how you can pat yourself on the back for this, while planning to RIP HEALTHCARE AWAY from millions.

#wasteofasenateseat
I hope you will vote no for #GrahamCasiddy
Can't even list all the things you've IGNORED that have weakened our country.  

GOP leadership has made US most vulnerable in decades.
Yes but Pat's bank account is at its strongest! He doesn't care abt me, u or anyone else but his bees, his fam n his job that funnels corp $
Russia sowing discord in this country. Troll farms, spies, etc. - ALL TRAITORS & POTUS STILL can't condemn Russia?
PA has lost faith in you. If you vote for this terrible healthcare bill your constituents will remember next election.
We won't forget your behavior this year, Pat. We never will.
My teenagers know his name well. They will be voters very, very soon!
And while the US cedes world leadership to China/Russia/Germany, Americans have to defend themselves against GOP REAMING US.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
LOL - gutted state dept, blustery/idiotic attempts at diplomacy, no 9/11 style commission to fend off current/future Russian attacks, etc.
He's the Koch brother's puppet. They've got their hands up his ass and into his eyeballs. He's a yes.
