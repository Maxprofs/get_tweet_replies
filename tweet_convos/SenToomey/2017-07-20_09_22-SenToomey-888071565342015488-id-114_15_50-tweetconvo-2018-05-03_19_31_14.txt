JFK: We CHOOSE to go to the moon, because it is hard! We can improve health care! Let's have a  #UniversalHealthCareCommission
And now you can't support the health and betterment of your constituents.
Science is pretty cool, huh? Man on moon, iPhones, climate change...oh wait, that ones a hoax made up by the Chinese. My bad.

That's why you need to support federal funding for research
All made possible by Science! That thing you're against. 

Did you enjoy your taxpayer funded lunch yesterday? #SaveACA #voteNO 

A
Toomey and his daily pile of word poo
This PA constituent (19144) demands that you do NOT vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I support #ACA & I vote. #SaveTheACA #NoRepeal
2017: you're in bed with anti-science, anti-innovation nuts who wouldn't have supported Apollo 11. Thanks for the reminder, Pat!


Demand @SenToomey votes NO on a motion to proceed to debate about #RepealAndRun. Call him: 844-432-0883 #StayLoud 

CALL,EMAIL,TWEET & FAX @SenateGOP #StopTrumpCare @SpeakerRyan 

Can't get through their PH resisbot @GOP…
Love this tribute, sir. In 2017 we would love to turn our gaze to YOU. In person. At a Town Hall.


"That’s the attitude of supplicants toward royalty, not toward free men and women who have taken an oath to uphold the constitution" https://twitter.com/jrubinblogger/status/888408969269719040 …
Remember Pres. Ronald Reagan? He warned us about 'the evil empire' - russia. Your continuing inaction is endorsement
Waisting oney that could have spend on healthcare.
And yet we have congressmen and senators that are science deniers. How sad is that?
Just a reminder that you too are not above the law and you work FOR US!
Maybe you need to heed these words!
Im surprised that you believe we did land on the moon, given that you have virtually no faith in science.
And if you had been in Congress then you'd have voted against funding the Apollo program.
Truth
Senator Toomey, 71% of Americans want Republicans to reach across the aisle and work with Dems on healthcare. Will you reach out to Casey?
Hello Toomey, anyone out there? so will you reach across the isle? will you talk to talk and work with the governors of each state?
Let's send Trump, Pence, and their whole ship of fools on a new mission into space.
Mars baby!
And now people are believing the earth is flat because science is unacceptable. We have a problem.

Get a job! Oh, u have one..
Do your job!


He is bought and paid for
He's going to get voted out if he doesn't man up.
And if you continue to gut the EPA and ignore global warming. Pretty soon.we will not have an earth to enjoy
Toomey is a Koch Bros puppet who continues to hide from his constituents. What an embarrassment.
Feels like that might be the last time Congress worked together toward a common, positive goal.
It's interesting to see how active you are on twitter when the subject isn't that steamy clump of llama excrement you call a healthcare bill
Toomey shows his sleazy strips each and every day. not surprised.
do you know what another small step is? the really "sad" and "bigly bad"  healthcare plan from Republican party. Big step for wealthy pals
yeah back when you guys weren't afraid to pay taxes
#FixTheACA #FixTheACA #FixTheACA #FixTheACA #FixTheACA #FixTheACA
hey patti do you realize it was government funds and the government employees you hate who accomplished that? #onthetaketoomey
Stop bragging on things u had nothing to do with and talk about your legacy: Stripping health care unfunding science creating fascist USA
If we can do that, why can't you figure out a healthcare plan that DOESN'T deprive millions of Americans of healthcare access?! Vote NO 4 PA
You should see my moon.
Oh, so science *is* a real thing. Oh good. So when's your next town hall?
Please stop acting like you are human Trumpbot....
Too bad @realDonaldTrump is cutting @NASA budget.
Really? Your entire platform is against science and knowledge! #ClimateChangeIsReal #HealthCareMatters #TownHallNOW
Stop pretending you wouldn't have defunded NASA to give you wealthy donors a tax break.
#ToomeyMIA Hey Toomey Pennsylvanians demanding to speak with you
#Apollo11 #BuzzAldrin I'll always remember Buzz Aldrin's face as he listened to Trump talk about space travel
OTDIH 2017: Your constituents called and left a message for you: Do not even try to repeal the ACA.
#Apollo11 was taxpayer-funded
And if you were a Senator back then, you would have opposed any funding into the heavens. Unless of course, it was to speak with God.
Will you ever turn your gaze to your constituents?
And this year : department of Science is dismantled
As a constituent please help us little guys from being censored on social media. It's A BIG problem. Pass a bill to that prevents censorship
Senator That was a wonderful day. Now turn your gaze to your constituents who need you to protect them against GOP Healthcare
Did you know that this and many other amazing scientific endeavors were funded with tax dollars?
These sorts of feats will be much less likely in the future if you and your colleagues continue to defund science programs
Thank you for serving yourself, your donors and your party above those citizens you should be serving.
I am surprised you don't think it was faked.
Gazing to the heavens for help is the only recourse you are giving to Pennsylvanians who will be denied healthcare. Work for the people dude
@SenToomey don't talk about the Earth as you have no interest in saving people on the Earth.  You want us sick and dying!
Funny, i never questioned the moon landing or the conspiracy around it, until you just tweeted this. THAT is how much I trust you.
Who runs this account? It's fucking terrible.
We should make Mars habitable. Then we can leave all the R Cong. here where they can turn their hostilities on each other & leave us alone.
Seriously? First you try to distract from your dereliction of duty and evil with dogs and now this nonsense?! #doyourjob #shame
Turn you gaze down here to your constituents. Hmmm. When are you up for reelection? Hold a town hall!
Remember this as Trump/DeVos/the GOP guts science funding and denigrates the pursuit of knowledge as "elitism."
We'd all love to turn our gaze on you at an in-person townhall.
We went to the moon, yet you deny the science of Climate change #Period
Enough distractions. Where do you stand on Russia, our future security from russia and get serious on #TrumpRussia
We are under attack from russia. You hide in your office, working to take healthcare from elderly, children and disabled. Benedict Toomey
We, the people you work for want a legitimate, open townhall. Not games on FB, not on TV. In person to discuss #Wealthcare and #TrumpRussia
Its time to recall pat toomey now
Thats thr place u should be a senator for the moon. You would not have  to worry about health care.
Yay NASA, of course!  But WTF, *this* you choose to tweet about when we're all trying to defend health care and you're trying to screw us?
2017:  GOP shoots Obamacare in the head, has no answers of their own
Onward to Mars!
Well, gee, Pat. That's nice. Now, will you start talking with your Constituents about fixing ACA with Dems?
Didn't do anything for an investment bank's bottom line;  surprised you care.
OTDIH 2017: Pat Toomey, former senator from PA resigned after authoring the most distasteful healthcare legislation the country had seen.
Think just how brave they were. Almost like facing your constituents at a #TownHall . Facing the challenge?? #Toomey #Healthcare
U need to come back to earth with a healthcare plan that doesn't screw millions of Americans.
#Bought&PaidForToMe
Wow, considering your anti-science views it's unbelievable that you acknowledge the moon landing did happen.
I bet if people lived on the moon, the moon's government wouldn't let people die without health care
What are we more likely to see in my lifetime?
Yikes...hit the wrong response accidentally
It's OK to be hopeful! If Neil Armstrong can travel 238K miles & step onto the moon, maybe Toomey can step into a room with his constituents
And yet your party time and time again refuses to believe science. Yet you applaud this?
You call the ACA a failure but revel in the success of NASA. You forget what it took to get a man on the moon. You cause failure not success
The administration eviscerates science at every turn, and the immigration policy is already seeing the "brain drain" begin.  #GOP
I'm surprised you believe this. Also don't repeal the ACA! #ProtectSUDServices
And you've forgotten mankind by wanting healthcare that will exclude most
To the moon Alice!
And today in history I and my entire political party refuse to believe in science or math.  So, progress...
Would you like to go? I'll be happy to send you there while we here in PA get a Senator who works for us.
You don't get to tweet this, your anti-science stance makes accomplishments like this impossible.
tee hee, funny, yet so sad
Guess I'll be turning my gaze towards the heavens in hopes of decent healthcare?

A tweetstorm, just for you, @SenToomey ...a little more than 21 years ago, my wife and I attended our first childbirth class
OTDIH 2017: Out-of-touch junior senator from PA continues to push secret bill to strip health insurance from his own constituents.  Shame!
Because, you know....Without Science  ???
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
I live in Apollo, Armstrong County, PA!! We need a fair health care for all Americans!!!
Very nice Senator.  When's your next townhall?
We turn our gaze to you, and you ignore us.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Now we have Trump and the GOP. What happened?

Pennsylvanians cuffed after sitting in Sen. Toomey's office asking for health care to be protected. #StopTrumpCare 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare
