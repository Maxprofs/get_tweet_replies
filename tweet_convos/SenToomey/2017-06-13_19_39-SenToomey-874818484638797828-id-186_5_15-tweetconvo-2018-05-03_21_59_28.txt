I urge you to reject Trumpcare and stop trying to force it on a country that clearly doesn't want it. Stop putting the party over the people
Have a random town hall in his office. Call his office everyday. Tweeting does nothing. Let's have a rally at his office. #revolt
Calling does nothing, email nothing...
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.  _ Bob Dylan
What about that transparency in government that you espoused last year?? FRAUD MUCH?? #ShowUsTheBill #resist #theresistance #ACA
Of course you save money on Medicaid. You're throwing millions off of health care and giving those savings to the rich. Not fooled.
1/2 Because "State and local governments are estimated to finance $37 billion, or 0.5 percent, more; and private businesses and
You are living in a dream world.  Your constituents do NOT want ACA repealed or replaced.  Just listen to us and work on fixing it!
Senator,theres no excuse 4 no hearings on Senate bill.We can disagree abt policy and ur votes thereon but the people have a right 2 know
Quit calling your plan “savings” What alternate reality are you in? If you gut medicaid for the disabled families pay more and get less.
you represent. Vote NO on Trumpcare.
public and every party should have transparency into bills being passed#unitedforfreedom #accountability#totalrepeal
Stay focused on conservative values. Demand a #FullRepeal & #KeepThePromise of small gov't. #UnitedForFreedom!
It is wrong to cause big increases in insurance costs to older people, as Trumpcare will do, to give million $ incomes a tax cut.
This is my favorite presidency Why? Because the corrupt Republican party is killing itself. Who won't keep their seat? YOU! #ShowUsTheBill
Mitch the Bitch is hiding the Healthcare bill. We don't want you voting for a bill that is hidden from the American people. We are watching
Dear Senator show us the secret health care bill ,this is a disgrace, you work for us!
You swore to support and defend the Constitution not make backroom deals for the rich at the expense of the public.
2/2 "..other private revenues are expected to finance $63 billion, or 0.5 percent, less of such spending"
Please don't throw poor constituents and seniors and veterans under the bus just to pave way for minimal tax savings for wealthy.
Let's see that Senate HC bill then.
Please vote no on this bill, sir. I have left messages on ur vm with my name, adrs, & ph #. This is not was is best 4 PA or USA!
Sounds like a misinterpretation to me since you won't share link to actual study and haven't come out against Senate hiding #ShowUsTheBill
Bullet points in your own press release aren't proof of anything - link the actual report so we can see its methodology and criticize it.

this doesn't include a link to a report, so methodology can't be evaluated, such as preposterous notion premiums only go up 5%
Also to be clear it shows current house bill is stillworse than ACA
Quit acting like you give a crap about us! All you care about is your corporate sponsors!
The ACA is collapsing due to GOP sabotage. Ppl's lives at stake and you're playing politics to give tax cuts to the wealthy. Shame on you.
American Voters: Make sure to vote these men OUT OF OFFICE if they  repeal ACA and try to replace it with garbage known as TrumpCare #AHCA
I can't wait for loved ones to lose their health insurance. We are happy to ensure suffering resulting from greed! #ShowUsTheBill
#ShowUsTheBill
It also says"the actual future impacts are very uncertain" and could result in "deteriorating or possibly failing individual market".
If savings are 50% below that means that there are fewer savings i.e. it costs more.
YOU, Sir, are killing us LITERALLY! Stop playing around with our lives and loved ones.
Just stop it already.  All the lies and tortured justifcations.  Let everyone see it a judge for themselves.  Why do you support hiding it?
This closed-door wheeling and dealing is exactly what will get you in trouble very soon.
Let's see the Bill. #ShowUsTheBill
Prove it before you say it's true. Predictions never are 100%.
Are you really cheering the fact that between 13 and 23 million will lose their insurance? Why won't you publish the bill? #ShowUsTheBill
Obviously CMS as it pertains to you Pattie = #CorruptMendaciousSenator ... Try(or is that lie) again ... #AHCAkills #NoAHCA
You will save when you kick 50%or more off of medicare-medicade.   How much of a tax break for you personally?
Show us the bill.

#DefundPP
"Savings" equal Tax Cuts for Billionaires
And that's how much in tax savings for billionaires while millions of hardworking Americans can't see a doctor when they're sick
I just tried to call your office to ask for Public Hearings for Trumpcare-- no one picked up. Do the right thing show us the bill
We're supposed to trust your interpretation of the Bill! Hell No!
Do they predict that what is happening is a travesty? A betrayal of the trust of your constituents?
I've gotten to the point I believe nothing out of your mouth, you have done nothing to help the middle class. 18974
How do WE know since you and your bandits haven't let anyone SEE THE BILL!!
If you are so confident show us the bill PA19525
Transparency! Keep the preexisting health issue Claus. This effect women and children the most. Not fair, discrimination!
CMS doesn't take the tax cuts into consideration or the pre-existing conditions waiver. It still estimates 13 million lose coverage
#AmericanHealthCatastropheAct  is a travesty no matter how you try to defend it. It is only an attempt to let ins cos profit more. Sad!
this seems like a good argument for publically releasing bill, then a period of deliberation and comment before voting.
How about you go back and look at CMS be CBO prdctns on Ocare?! Btwn 5 non-partsn orgs CBO got it right!CMS was farthest off by over 125%!
CMS v CBO.   I can't  believe the shifty slimy nature of this senate session and just looking for numbers to fit your agenda.Unconscionable
Of course you save money when you don't insure people. I save money if I don't pay my bills, too. #ShowUsTheBill
and how many people are no longer covered?
Kind of like saying if I don't buy a house I'll save on house insurance. Dumb
#ShowUsTheBill  what are you afraid of?
New prediction still leaves 13-14 million people without coverage. Some will die. It will be on you.
Awaiting the public hearings on the healthcare bill.
Medicaid savings by throwing the needy off Medicaid? No one should lose Medicaid! What do you have against the elderly and disabled?
Qiud pro quo offering by @GOP have anything to do with that?  @sentoomey = @realDonaldTrump
Do you ever look at the responses of your constituents?   Did it feel good to write the tweet?  You should look at the responses.
You mean savings by blocking thousands of PA seniors and young people from receiving affordable health care?   Also a tax break for wealthy.
Well then, if you are so confident, you will surely have to problem letting the public see your newest proposal!
And maybe that's a great thing... but can we see the bill also?
So basically the inter-observer variation is huge. Your tweet suggests no one has any idea re Medicaid savings. Sad.
But how would we know? Let us check out the new version! Also, some of the savings mentioned by the CBO were from early deaths. Savings?
Oh. 18702. Wilkes Barre!!
Is "Medicaid savings" your slick way of referring to the millions of American citizens who will be kicked off Medicaid?
And lastly, for Christ's sake, learn how to do a thread on Twitter.
How about you hold a Town Hall so I can bring my two daughters who are on PA Medicaid, so you can see the 'savings?' #MeetMedicaidPA
The 'savings' will put my 20 yr old daughter w/ autism into an institution, instead of being employed & paying taxes. #MeetMedicaidPA
Insulin saves my daughter with Type 1 diabetes life every day. She is #MeetMedicaidPA The 'savings' will propel our family into bankruptcy.
Why should we just take your word for it? When did you ever earn our trust? What makes you think savings are the priority? #ShowUsTheBill
Savings for who? And how do we know anything bc you wont hold hearing? We taking ur word? You lie constantly, GOP lies constantly.
I can't access the link. Show us the bill.
That is just not true! Even Trump for this minute thinks the bill is MEAN. Please Senator tell us again how great Trumpcare will be for 24M?
Why don't you come up with a bill in secret to cut healthcare for members of Congress and then rush it to a vote? #ShowUsTheBill
Even with cherry picking reports, CMS predicts 13 million will lose insurance. Many of whom will die. Is that acceptable to you?
Why are Drs, nurses, hospitals,AARP, nursing homes,health clinics against your plan? Junk insurance . best for rich???30 yr. old grandson CF
You have blown our trust too many times- show it to the ENTIRE Senate & the rest of us too.Act like the *representative* you're supposed 2B
GOFUCKYOURSELF
ALTERNATIVE FACTS
What's a few lives without insurance, give or take 10 million? Can you actually hear yourself?
Hey Pat, I was recently kicked in 50% of my nuts and I did not consider it much of an improvement over the previous 100% kick in the nuts...
Show us the bill! Why are you hiding it? Will there be public hearings? There should be. It's the right thing to do.
Please open the Senate health care bill to the public, Senator.
Show us the bill.
Probably more as many will die before they can use much of it. I'll bet your thrilled to get rid of the Poor so easily

Stop being cowards and show us the Bill. Hold hearings. Do your job and do right by your constituents - our lives depend on it. (18938) #pa8
So you're going to pay the difference for those of us in PA who get screwed by your decisions?
CMS analysis assumes stable indiv market
That's like analyzing enemy in war assuming that their tech & tactics won't change with conditions
SHOW. US. THE. BILL.
We want a better ACA, not tax breaks for the wealthiest and nothing  for working class and poor. Or single payer for all. We see you!
Nobody believes the crap you spew Koch bro!!!
Did you get my message? About how my family will go bankrupt. #ShowUsTheBill 8 of us r ready 2 vote against u
GOP doesn't realize my kids will be voting in next election cycle. More Dems on the way!
I don't know who to believe I do know ur MIA & u ignore ur constituents, so till u have a town hall to discuss I'm going to assume u lie
AHCA saves $2 billion in future Social Security payouts because of early deaths. Why not just push them off a cliff now?
No. The only acceptable #Medicaid option is to expand. What will you tell your rural constituents when their hospitals close? #showusthebill
It's very difficult to take you seriously when you're defending a bill that will quite literally cause people I like to lose their lives.
CBO projected 23 million would lose insurance? A 45% improvement is STILL millions that would lose healthcare. That's a lot of deaths.
It's still awful. Like the difference between Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But you've got yours, Jack; keep your hands off of our stack
#showusthebill  Your website will do  When is your term up?
Not soon enough
So right can't wait to send Howdy Doody packing!!
So 10 million + losing healthcRe is still OK? No way! #ShowUsTheBill
CMS estimates that the American Health Care Act would reduce insurance coverage by 13 million people by 2026. You think this is good news?
CMS projected that households wld face $221B more in med expenses in 2017-26 under the repeal bill, largely bc subsidies wld be skimpier
As the mother of a child with autism, I say:

#ShowUsTheBill 
#ShowUsTheBill
In other words, so you can give the wealthy a tax cut, ur taking money from Medicare/Medicaid and making those in need pay more @SenToomey
Even if correct, GOP plan still kicks 10-16 mil people off health ins. You're ok w/ this? And high-risk pools? Shame on you. #ShowUsTheBill
Oh I just remembered u were scheduled to have dinner with @realDonaldTrump.  Did you take pledge of loyalty? Did he offer your family jobs?
He had to kiss his ring first.
We have no reason to believe anything you say! R's won't show bill and you refuse to face your constituents...and you're a rubber stamp 4 45
R u srsly bragging that an agency that's supported the AHCA from Day 1 says, best case, ONLY 13 million people lose insurance, @SenToomey?
This is unacceptable. You must have public hearings on a publicly available Senate bill. To do otherwise is wrong and you know it.
Did you get my message, Sen. Toomey? We really, really, really, really, really support the ACA. I mean, really. Really. #ACA
Show us the bill!!!
Put five minutes in your calendar tomorrow to call Toomey and ask him to make the bill PUBLIC!
Tell Toomey to #ShowUsTheBill!
DC: (202) 224-4254
Allentown: (610) 434-1444 
Harrisburg: (717) 782-3951…
And email his healthcare aides: 
brad_grantz@toomey.senate.gov
theodore_merkel@toomey.senate.gov
They don't respond :(
Even if they don't respond, we keep emailing. They need to know that huge numbers of us know what they are trying to do. Keep it up!
Good point. I will call and email again. I don't mind harassing them daily :)
Thank you.
I'm confused, ur talking about house bill BUT shouldn't we talk about Senate bill??  The one you plan on hiding & voting on?!  Unamerican!
Show us the bill.
Show us the bill.
Show us the bill.
Show us the bill.

#ShowUsTheBill
we want to SEE the proposal. Not hear about it from tweets.
Then show us the bill. It's a simple thing. It's called: the right thing.
No one trusts @SenateGOP to look out for the health of tens of millions of Americans. You're looking for numbers to justify your depravity.
are these the same geniuses who worked on incompetent businessman and barely president @realdonaldtrump 's sham budget?
Savings, huh? Take healthcare away from 23 million americans and you think it's great? What's in the GOP Senate bill?
Why are you so concerned with the House Bill right now? Show us your Senate proposal! #ShowUsTheBill #AHCA
Cause I'm dreaming, ah ah ah ah!
Great. Medicaid costs less, and who cares if people die. Gotcha.
Get an intern to show you how to thread your tweets.

Can someone please explain the #AHCA bill to @karenhandel? #healthcare #GA06 #Flipthe6th 
It took you that long to publish part 2 of a 2 part tweet? 
he had to stop laughing
Why are you working in secret???
Healthcare is too important to all of us to have you pass a bill that you have to hide from the public!
If you vote to screw up my healthcare, I will register as Republican just so I can vote against u in the primary AND the general election!
Really? So why won't you guys #ShowUsTheBill? How many millions of people are kicked off? How high are premiums? Preexisting conditions?
