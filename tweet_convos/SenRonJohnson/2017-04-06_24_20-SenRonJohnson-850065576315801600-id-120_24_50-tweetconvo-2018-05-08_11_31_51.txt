You are the LAST person who should comment on the will of the people.
Both sides should be embarrassed & you have all let the country down. UR all focused on your own parties agenda. #timetoretire #termlimits
MERRICK GARLAND! Thank you @SenatorBaldwin for standing up for your principles
Senator Baldwin was voted in and speaks up for her constituents.  When I email you with concerns, you vote party first.
It was WI @GOP Senator Joe McCarthy who began the childish use of "Democrat" in lieu of "Democratic?"  Be better than that.
This is not my will and I am a Wisconsin voter. You do not speak for me.
Hypocritical much, senator Johnson? Thank you, Senator Baldwin! Appreciate Senator Baldwin's work. At least she listens to the people of WI
You and the GOP exercised partisan obstruction ahead of the will of Wisconsin voters last year in blocking a vote for Judge Garland.
you all put the GOP ahead of the American people, ie ACA  insurance for working people, dismantling the EPA SO WE HAVE CLEAN AIR etc!
Not mine... come talk to your constituents... see what they say!
No sir, Wisconsin voters want a legitimate govt not stolen with help by Russians.  You either stand up or out
#gorsuch was appointed by someone now under federal investigation! Why doesn't that end the conversation?! Also why is he cool with that?!
Unfortunately RoJo joined his Republican colleagues in denying Merrick Garland a hearing
Merrick Garland.
HYPOCRITE!
Shutting out your constituents' voices will not silence them. Thank you for listening to us, Senator Baldwin! 53227 #resist
Nice job destroying democracy today, Ron.

If you're so confident that voter's wanted this, why are you avoiding a #TownHall?

#YouWorkForUs
@SenRonJohnson you are supremely out of touch with the will of WI voters. Maybe take a call or answer and email. #badsenator #sad
You just don't get it, do you Ron. Wisc wanted a NO vote, but you chose to ignore us.
Scrolling through the comments here @SenRonJohnson and there's solid evidence that you have no clue about the will of Wisconsin voters
spoken like a hypocrite. Has Sen Johnson ever had nanosec of principle differing from GOP
Funny thing the "will of voters"--it can change very quickly when people become engaged, educated and energized!
So you weren't ignoring our will when you obstructed Garland, even though that's what we wanted? Open your eyes, Senator. We. Are. Pissed.
As opposed to your irresponsible refusal to even consider Merrick Garland. #RonJohnson_hypocrite
Again, how do you know the will of Wisconsin voters? Do you have evidence/numbers to back up your claim?
And, please remember, you represent all of your constituents and not just the ones who voted for you and align with your political party.
What did you do to bring a vote to the floor for Merrick Garland?  Hypocrite
You, sir, are a hypocrite of the highest magnitude.
What goes around comes around.  Your nuclear option won't look too smart when the shoe is on the other foot and your filibuster is squashed.
Angry that you changed the way our founding fathers set things up!  What happened to valuing the Constitution?!
How hypocritical of you and how quickly you forget about Merrick Garland. @SenatorBaldwin listens to WI voters.
Unfortunately you put partisan obstruction ahead of the rules and the wishes of your constituents.
Oh you mean like you did Garland?  What do you know about the will of WI voters? You won't have a town hall or take calls. #resist
You are wrong.   remember Garland.
No, that has been your role over the last few months.
No, that's what you do by not listening to what is voters are contacting you about.
this is real rich, given your stance on anything Obama did.
Where were you Ron when Garland was nominated you're party is pathetic
Partisan obstruction is your middle name, you hypocrite! #MerrickGarland
You should be ashamed. The nuclear option should never have been used. It will come back to bite you.
This is pure nonsense. We all know what it takes to get you to listen to WI residents. #boughtandsold #outoftouch
Veerrrry short OR selective memory, Senator.
Like what you did last year!
Now you're sounding both mean to @SenatorBaldwin and inaccurate characterizing the whole of WI voters. Keep your eye on the ball, Ron.
Unfortunately you put #partyaheadofpeople, you big bully. But you wouldn't know unless you #meetwithyourconstituents.
Look in the mirror and judge yourself!
Not this #WisconsinVoters will. And we'll remember who voted for #NuclearOption
Hypocrite
Nice try. You obstructed Pres Obama's pick of M Garland for 8 months. Talk about hypocrisy.
that's because she listens to her constituents. Unfortunately for us, you don't.
again....stop throwing all voters in one basket.  It sounds dumb
Didnt republicans block Garland b/c it would tilt the ideological beliefs away from conservative views?
You are such a partisan hypocrite that it is embarrassing to me as a Wisconsin citizen
Attacking the one WI senator who IS actually answering her phone shows lack of class. You're sticking w/Trump & GOOD LUCK w/that. #DoYourJob
Thank you @SenatorBaldwin for being only Wisconsin senator to listen to us!! Apparently Ron Johnson has forgotten that GOP started this mess
You spent your entire senate career obstructing everything @POTUS44 did that could have helped Wisconsinites because he was a Democrat.
To do that, then turn around and accuse @SenatorBaldwin of abdicating her duty is pathetic and unconscionable. I'm ashamed you represent me.
Voters will not forgive or forget the nuclear option. GOP will regret this in 2016. #midtermsarecoming #FlipCongress2016
This WI voter disagrees.
I support bipartisan governance and the thought of e pluribus unum. Not changing the rules to get your way, no matter what party.
Whose "will?"  Baldwin represents me.  If only you could listen....
"Partisan obstruction" was preventing Merrick Garland from even coming up for a vote. This is on you, GOP.
Please do your job as a senator and stop att king other senators. @SenatorBaldwin  isn't attacking you. From, your constituent.
I'll say the same for you and your GOP colleagues.
Unfortunately @SenRonJohnson joined his Republican colleagues in partisan rule changing when they couldnt get  60 votes #getabettercandidate
It is you @SenRonJohnson who is playing partisan politics by voting for Gorsuch.  Party over people not cool.
Nothing like you've ever done, right? With Merrick Garland, perhaps?
And you -- yet again -- put party ahead of country by voting to confirm a sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, bigot.
Your VM is full again. Wonder why. Not that you listen to constituents.
Your pants =Nuclear option, gerrymandering, voter suppression and hated policies. Clear that @GOP are DC elites who don't listen to voters
I live in Wisconsin and agree with HER not YOU!  Enjoy your last term from a Wisconsin Voter!!!
Merrick Garland
it is unfortunate that you are a hypocrite who is bought and paid for by special interests
You and other republicans are the queens of partisan obstruction, mate.
Do you even understand the word "hypocrite" Sen. Johnson? You're galvanizing Dems.
GOODBYE. #2018
"Will of Wisconsin voters"?  Speak for yourself.  I didn't want Gorsuch.
And you would never be partisan or obstruct, right Mr. Johnson
Stolen seat.
Thank goodness that Tammy Baldwin was willing to stand up and do what was right for this country. Using the nuclear option was a big mistake
As a WI voter & parent of autistic kids, I will remember who pushed the justice with the anti-autistic track record and who tried to stop it
NOT.
I fixed it for you.
All political she voted against Judge Gorsuch not because wouldn't make a good judge but Dems R obstructionists
Screw you, Johnson. #MerrickGarland
Don't you dare try to call out Senator Baldwin. She actually listens to her constituents. Try listening to us for once.
Did you mean Gorsuch or Garland?
Then what did you do when you refused Obama's nominee?
(Cough) (Cough) Hypocrite! (Cough)...
Thanks for your service to WI & US.
What an unsenatorial tweet. How embarrassing.
Kinda hypocritical, really. Ron Johnson helped obstruct Garland even though WI voted for Obama 4yrs ago.
Unfortunately you do not listen to the constituents who call your office or fax you @SenatorBaldwin has my support as well as many others
Baldwin is not afraid to show up to town halls and meet her constituents, unlike Ron Johnson. He is standing w/Trump, not his constituents.
"Fortunately, @SenatorBaldwin joined her Democrat heros in putting justice ahead of the will of the failing @GOP." There - I fixed it.
Just like you did for Garland. I stand with @SenatorBaldwin
No, she is following me, a Wisconsin voter. You follow your corporate overlords.
Unfortunately, you didn't give Merrick Garland a chance. You wouldn't even schedule a hearing...shame on you and your Repub colleagues
MERRICK GARLAND
Kinda like you did with @POTUS44 nomination?
