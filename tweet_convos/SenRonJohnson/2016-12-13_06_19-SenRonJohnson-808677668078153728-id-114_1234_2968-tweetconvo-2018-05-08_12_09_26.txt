Why don't all you lovers of Putin move to Russia.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ALL YOU DIMMI SNOWFLAKES, THE LEAK CAME FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ITSELF, ASSANGE CONFIRMED !!
Find your brain. Are you reading every other word? Assange was duplicitous.
WELL WIKI LEAKS SURE EXPOSED THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TREASONOUS DEMS HUH, ARE YOU NOT APPALLED BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THY HEROES ?
I am far less appalled at them than I am at the lying megalomaniac that was elected. Selective fact picking is harmful.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A GOOD MAN WHO WILL PROTECT AMERICA, SECURE HER BORDERS THUS PROTECTING HER CITIZENS ! U WILL SEE :) GOD BLESS
U don't have to use all caps. I can hear u. I wish you were right, but afraid you've been hoodwinked.
So you're OK with Russia calling the shots for our government?  Country before party, you hack.
He's dissing US intelligence services and praising Russian. Not exactly an America first guy. You got played!
A foreign entity hacking our campaign for one candidate is a bit different, no? Useful Putin idiots
Bending over backwards to defend Putin and Russia. I get it.
but how can ExonnMobile billion dollar deals prohibited by murderer Putin (see Sen. McCain) sanctions not be a conflict?
The question 2 u was abt OUR election. Not about how Russia plays abt in other countries!
Nice deflection. #StandWithAmerica
God bless you Sen. Johnson.
are all you guys in bed with Putin???
strength not weakness.
@trumpy17 :
Senator your help and the help of the other Senators is needed to get these nominees confirmed.
@_Makada_ @lgmaterna @EricSuper5 @latinaafortrump America is Watching Congress for Promise Keeping. #PresidentElectTrump
that's for sure, u need to learn this if not allready
Glad you recognize how great this is. Tillerson gives USA a unique understanding of geopolitics to anticipate likely moves.
.@SenRonJohnson @Trump_World yes!!!
Really Ron, why didn't you back Trump during the election, you would've won in a landslide. Disappointed in you.
Michele Moore,George Soros,Al Sharpton, HRC need to be arrested.Trying to undermine our democracy&creating violence w/riots
@Melanee7305 except for this #StopCommonCore
@mcicero10 The Best & The Brightest revisited
You're probably get paid off too.  congratulations on forgetting who you represent.  Hope you like Kanye West
Totally agree with you Senator. Thank you for your support of our 45th POTUS. God bless you.
Senator Johnson, you R so blessed 2 work directly with President Trump & B a part of Making America Great Again.
@SpeakerRyan @WayneDupreeShow @mitchellvii @VivaLaAmes Congress Enact America First Agenda. #Results #PresidentElectTrump
@Rick_Gorka ask him about his BFF, Putin. Then deny him your vote.
@seanspicer More Ignorance
ROGER THAT! TELL RHINOS TO GET ON BOARD! THEY GAVE obummer EVERYTHING HE WANTED GIVE TRUMP WHAT HE NEEDS!
@TeamTrump I am troubled by carbon tax that Rex supports. Climate change is a fraud
And folks who aren't on the dole!! Or need govt jobs to make them wealthy at taxpayer expense!!
@rlb99er And 5 minutes later, start solving problems.
@JasonMillerinDC  Correct: all DJT appointments are "players" to change democracy to autocracy to their benefit
no Ron you focus on America.......................geesh
Will be important for entire Pres. Elect Trump staff to learn as much as they can from outstanding selection.
Many, many Americas qualified to be Secretary of State who do not have multi-billions invested in foreign governments.
2014 - "Tillerson talked up his company's prospects in Russia" alongside Igor Sechin, "who has been sanctioned by US gov't."
2014 - Fred Bergsten, quoted by a fellow economist on "Putinomics" -->
@TeamTrump dems use class warfare against the wealthy while they secretly become wealthy while in office hypocrisy
That is not a logical reaction to the nomination.
@transition2017 well worn word: "Global".
it'd be more prudent to wait until after the confirmation hearings before gushing. At least feign objectivity.
@transition2017
We need to save the persecuted Christians in Syria, Iraq and the ME.. Obama has left them to suffer and die..
welcome to the trump team.we voters look forward to what you can acomplish in global matters.we put trust n faith in abilitys
@JasonMillerinDC Way to think forward, Senator.  "Only a fool walks into the future backwards."
RT @SenRonJohnson: Tillerson nom adds another world-class player to impressive team. I look forward to meeting, discussing enormous global…
@TeamTrump Trump will be our hardest working president. AWESOME!
@TeamTrump @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Exxon Consultants Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates Endorse Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson

@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Tillerson is the Ultimate insider he would jeopardize national security and only care about Exxon
@realDonaldTrump Tillerson & Putin are best BUDS. Senator and I use that term loosely, you're ignorant if you think otherwise
We don't need players, but sober adults. Trump's boots are clean enough from your licking, going for the Desanex?
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump You should be concern with their conflicts of interest Tillerson made $500 billion deal with USSR
@transition2017 Remember the Socialist cabinet assembled by Obama. Academics without experience.
@transition2017 "world-class team", oh, you meant to say 'entitled, rich, privileged, white men' to rule w/ our new CEOOTUS.
@TeamTrump There go all the Raptor's. SORRY YA YA I KNOW JOKE OF THE DAY. I made myself smile with that one guess who is 1#
@transition2017 #POTUS #WeThePeople #DrainTheSwamp #LockHerUp #CommanderInChief #Flamingos4Trump #Breaking
America sees Trump completely intimidate Rep Senate using
twitter..bullying you all into submission. His plan succeeded.
another impressive Russophile. And u r another weak n feeble traitor. Line those pocket books b4 u r jailed.
@transition2017 he won't even use his own platitudes to describe Tillerson because he's afraid they won't mesh w/Trump. Weak.
@ Trump makes a wise choice We don't need a politician there. Proud of our new president elect Trump Never had so much hope.
@TeamTrump
@TeamTrump is Soros still paying u trolls or are u just being nasty for free?
Sure. There's nothing more important in the world than oil deals. Drill baby drill!
@TeamTrump gosh.. yes this is awesome!
.. Appointing a Putin lackey is NOT world class. Shame on you.
The past six years have been excruciating to watch Obama take America down a notch. Time to lift US up to the heavens @Reince
When will you address concerning ties with Russia?  Would you be gushing with praise if it were Hillary instead choosing him?
@transition2017 
Horror Cabinet (DeVos, Carson, Perry, Wall street banker, oil magnate)
What about the country, sir???
@transition2017 Good  #TrumpPresident #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump #TrumpTrain #MAGA #VPEOTUS #PEOTUS #AmericaFirst 
I really hope Tillerson wants to discuss global challenges. Worried he will only want to discuss business.
I hope you really look into Tillerson's background and connections. Business interests are complex and widespread. Study up!
@seanspicer @CNN -Maybe he can cut some deals at home like re-start factories in the rust belt or put food on the table?
@transition2017 In order to get away from political monsters, like you,  we need to use random generators to select our reps
keep your head in the sand an oil mogul with ties to Russia has no business as Sec of State. This will be the last president
A world class negotiator, great choice for SoS
@transition2017 excellent choice #MAGA #merrychristmas and #happynewyear2017
@transition2017
@JasonMillerinDC put pressure on Rubio and McCain and graham. We have too many internal enemies. They did not even call RT
@transition2017 another #TrumpetsPuppet
@transition2017 very impressive decision making! MAGA
.@SenRonJohnson @transition2017
stay on them about saving the #VapeIndustry my business and 20 employees are depending on you! Thank you! Educate Pence!
@transition2017 

Yet ANOTHER excellent choice by #PresidentTrump!

Thank you @realDonaldTrump for fixing the last 8yrs!

#FAKENEWS 

ZERO EVIDENCE #RussianHacking Distorted Voting…
@DrMartyFox   Lies are running rampant!  The CIA needs to clean this up NOW!!!
Yes, a "player." America deserves workers, workers on behalf of the people.
@transition2017 Nevermind the massive Conflicts of Interests .@ElectoralCollge .@HamiltonElector .@moralelectors @SenateDems
@transition2017 

@JasonMillerinDC I agree with you Senator.  And thank you for your service btw.  I'm excited about the first 100 days. 
Seriously? Friend of Vlad? Appeasement invites aggression.
John Kerry could learn a lot from that statement.
We shall add another name to the list.  Senator Ron Johnson Traitor.
I worry about Russian influence.
Like drilling all over the world for oil?
you just lost a follower.
Does anyone care, no no we don't.
Get back in your safe space.
your lack of integrity is astonishing
quit being such a CandyAss.
He is 
love it when GOP abandon their values, makes it all certain the party is about to crash and burn
or Supreme Court here in a few weeks.
