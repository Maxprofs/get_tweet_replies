Good news, stick by your principles.
I have lupus.MEDS cost $32,000/month- ACA/Medicaid keep me alive.AHCA will cause my death.When will you talk to my 2 young boys to explain?
Quit lying.  You are not about improving.   You are about doing whatever it takes to help your rich Bubba cronies.
The only way to improve the bill is to make it single payer.
Wow. I am stunned. U are in denial about this bill. It's a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poor and middle class. Look @ this
Nice way 4 GOP 2 follow suit since u've already made it so wealthy people don't pay inso SOC SEC as of Feb 2017!  Steal fr poor/give 2 rich!
#FullRepeal. Stand your ground and we stand with you. Don't let the socialist thugs have their way. Stand firm. #UnitedForFreedom.
Do not become a 'yes' without concessions. #HealthcareBill
Repeal this albatross in it's entirety as promised. No government healthcare. #KeepThePromise #UnitedForFreedom
Don't destroy U.S. healthcare. 45 stopped paying Ins. destabilize ACA Balance the budget by taxing the wealthy. This is a #WealthCare Bill
No thanks, this is not what Trump promised. Not At All. Your angry constituent.
What promise has trump kept? If he doesn't benefit from it- it's not going to be. You dear, were fooled.
How about making it an improvement where people actually gain access to health care, rather than 22 million Americans losing it
Be serious, people losing Medicaid aren't "opting out for freedom". Trumpcare has higher premiums & deductibles, and will hurt Americans
Bad bill, but look again. 22M claim really only 16 & is "private" Obamacare coverage. Remove mandate, people drop it
#FullRepeal  fed govt has zero jurisdiction over hc! We were promised a  full repeal every root & branch!  Make 10th amdnt relevant again!
##REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
Talk is cheap.  Show that you really care.  Improve ACA, not destroy it.
Did you cave already? If so, I'm done with you. #FullRepeal, stand with @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @RandPaul
#TrumpCare = 98% ACA, Hippocratic Oath: 1st, Do no harm!

Thank you for standing strong against socialized healthcare. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom #KeepYourPromise

Please save my daughter's insurance.  We are not worth millions, $500 in bank, and m in debt for children co pay
#SavetheACA Just FIX IT! Quit killing it! B4 ACA I was paying approx $2,000/mo due 2 pre-existing while CEO's took HUGE compensations! SAD!
You don't want women to abort babies with deformities but you don't want healthcare for them either. #GOP is a special kind of #evil
Holding a town hall anytime soon? The people you represent are not happy with this proposed "bill."
Johnson is one example why congress never gets things done & exactly why we need Trump. I support Trump 100% & want term limits for congress
You are clearly a level-headed guy. Not including Dems in the healthcare talks doesn't unify this effort or our country.
FLUSH IT ENTIRELY.
Kill Trumpwealthcare !!!!
You were not asking for suggestions this morning on morning Joe.  You okayed the bill just as it is.
By "improving" do you mean killing millions?
Thank you for being a principled conservative willing to stand strong against this tragic healthcare bill. We support you! #UnitedForFreedom
#FullRepeal #FreeMarket Vote  NO to #SwampCare!!  #UnitedForFreedom  Thank you!!
Don't eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood! The services they provide are vital...cancer screening, std testing, birth control...
Kill the bill not Americans.
No. No, no, no, no, no! Not improving it! Killing it, Ron! Don't pull this shit!
To improve it you need to be willing to work with the Democrats.  Please show some courage and do that.  @Greta @SenRonJohnson
Please don't hurt these kids w Needless Caps!

Answer why u would not vote for defunding PP, getting rid of 30 hr workweek rule, and forcing people to buy insurance your not conservative
My children (daughters) need affordable & real coverage health insurance. Vote ethical. Don't be an asshole thats Trump's job.
Maybe you should focus more on how history will see your morality corrupted Party as the greatest obstacle to progress of this century.
Seriously?  The pre existing provisions of the ACA must be preserved . It is the only humane thing to do.
Start by throwing it away.
#DoYourJob
cover pre-existing conditions, eliminate the "AGE TAX", leave pp alone, leave womens care alone.  you need to start over
Define better?
You think we are stupid, deflection period.O'care is your baby now.Unicare http://plus.You  are lying re; prems, tax cuts etc.
How about having an actual town hall to talk to the #Wisconsin constituents shut out of your telephone call yesterday?
Get the government out of healthcare, you clowns have nothing but cause harm to American citizens
GOP wants tax cuts 4 rich. 1st priority is people. Your money will outlive all of you.No tax cuts 4 rich.Expand Medicaid. Higher subsidies.
Please Just Make Improvements to ACA!
I have a pre-existing condition. When I can't afford my medical bills, can I just forward them to you? You say you want to help constituents
Wrong! There are 100 senators who want to fix healthcare problems. Work with them!!! Get this industry stable!
You are doing very little to help the people of Wisconsin. At least 3 interviews today...very little action.
Integrity first.
