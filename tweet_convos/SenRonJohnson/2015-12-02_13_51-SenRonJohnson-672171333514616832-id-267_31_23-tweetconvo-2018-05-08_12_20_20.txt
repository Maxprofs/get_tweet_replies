@SenRonJohnson r u here to answer my question criteria on terror suspects it's important shouldn't public know is poluticians really concern
@SenRonJohnson concerned???????????????????????????? God bless America
@SenRonJohnson dude. stop tweeting. don't watch developments. change the gun laws. your thoughts and prayers do nothing. #sanbernardino
What about gun control laws? R U happy with A given by Nat'l Rifle Assoc to U? Would U change if it was yr son among victims?
a sum the Sunlight Foundation notes is “far more than any other member of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation.”
, stop praying and LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE so deaths can stop. Hypocrite and money-grubber.
@SenRonJohnson Action/legislation will save lives, not paryers
@kzrt just curious, what's your source for the graph? I'd like to see the data.
@CrankyDoodle and I guess this is the original source http://bit.ly/1lYFfE8 
@kzrt thank you! :)
Keep your thoughts and prayers, they mean nothing. Vote for some gun control instead. #nrapuppet
, save your hypocrisy for those who don't know your voting record and $$$ u get from NRA, over a MILLION.
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has accepted more than $1.3 million from gun rights groups.
Johnson holds an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association for opposing gun control measures,
including a proposed ban on ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 bullets.
yeah, that helps.
@SenRonJohnson Your primary prayer should be that people don't find out how much you are in the pocket of those who perpetuate gun violence.
@SenRonJohnson still no criteria for terror suspect anyone please this is serious!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenRonJohnson You received $10,950 from the gun industry and prayers and thoughts are all you have????????? #CORRUPT
@SenRonJohnson Self-righteous hypocrisy. Got $2,000 from NRA during 2014 cycle to keep #SanBernadino victims in his prayers and little else
@SenRonJohnson #hypocrisy
@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson does "RJ" stand for the rim job you give the @NRA every morning?
@SenRonJohnson 
About those heartfelt prayers you so kindly offer up.
@SenRonJohnson Please explain voting against denying known terrorists the ability to purchase weapons a day after this  #accountforyourvote
@SenRonJohnson  Stuff your prayers. All you do is watch & collect your blood money from the NRA. They own you.
@SenRonJohnson You took more than $1.3M from gun rights groups and all you can offer is "thoughts and prayers?" Enough is enough!
@SenRonJohnson what exactly do you say in your prayers?
@SenRonJohnson Your prayers worthless but a vote for tightening gun laws critical.  Money to your opponent if you keep whoring for the NRA.
@SenRonJohnson You have the power to end this, but all you do is think and pray and watch and laugh while you spend money from the #NRA
@SenRonJohnson @RonJohnsonWI your thought & prayers are not for the victims but for @NRA 
You recv'd 1.3M $$ from America ISIS aka #NRA.
@SenRonJohnson Keep your thoughts and prayers. We don't need them. We need elected officials who fix out of control gun proliferation.
@SenRonJohnson And watch that 1.3 million of NRA money ensure prayer is the only thing you "try" to stop it? #Godisntfixingthis
@SenRonJohnson but keep cashing those @NRA checks dipshit
@SenRonJohnson you do that while you collect millions from gun rights groups. Your thoughts are in your wallet
@SenRonJohnson Why don't you send your 'A' rating from the NRA to the victim's families instead?
@SenRonJohnson You hold "A" rating from the NRA for opposing gun control measures and received more than $1.3Million from GR groups.  Shame.
@SenRonJohnson  $1.3 million worth of prayers the NRA bought from you, hun?  Prayers above lives.  #HowSweet
@SenRonJohnson yeah I am sure your thoughts will go far, while you accept NRA lobby dollars without issue.
@SenRonJohnson Horrifying that an elected official can accept $1.3M from gun lobby but can only send "thoughts and prayers" to the victims.
@SenRonJohnson @RonJohnsonWI give me a break. #hypocrite
@SenRonJohnson How does that 1.3 million blood soaked dollars from the gun lobby feel today? Prayers Do Not Stop Bullets.
@SenRonJohnson Well done! "Continue to watch" on behalf of NRA repugnicans. A former Wisconsinite here watching you & Walker ruin the state.
@SenRonJohnson @igorvolsky Prayers accomplish NOTHING. NRA shill Ron Johnson's a FLAKE.
@SenRonJohnson 
As long as your strings are pulled by that 1+ million you've gotten from the NRA, I won't hold my breath.
@SenRonJohnson Your prayers go no higher than mine.I pray you lose reelection @EWErickson @TheButteryOne @SuperSpez
@SenRonJohnson how much $$ has NRA given you? Blood on your hands.
@SenRonJohnson you're complicit in every shooting in the US during the time you have accepted NRA's $. Pray on that.
@SenRonJohnson no one wants your prayers. We want changes made to gun laws.
@SenRonJohnson and yet still no legislation #GunSense
@SenRonJohnson 
Oh gosh-are you the one who got a $1.4 million bribe by the NRA to allow such carnage? Karmas a bitch!
@SenRonJohnson while you wait for another $1.3 m from gun lobby?
@SenRonJohnson Stop praying and start legislating, you imbecile. God isn't going to fix this. Only we can. #GunControlNow.
@SenRonJohnson Do something about it instead of just getting rich.  'Sen. Ron Johnson has accepted more than $1.3M from gun rights groups'
Hey @SenRonJohnson Such a "thoughtful" tweet as you took $1.3 MILLION from gun groups in 2012... how much in this election cycle.. DOLT
@Niners_4Life_FB @SenRonJohnson @raysonenterpris
@SenRonJohnson Which God do you pray? Cause if you were Christian you should follow Jesus' word, which is against violence, aka guns
@SenRonJohnson Have you spent all that $1.3m NRA bribe yet? It was 3 years ago, perhaps you could buy another gun or two. That'll help.
@SenRonJohnson Is that what $1.3M in gun money buys? Prayers?  Shame on you!

#EndNRA
#SanBernadino
@SenRonJohnson killer
.@SenRonJohnson without meaningful gun legislation your words are empty and meaningless
@SenRonJohnson Another corrupt NRA mouthpiece actively supporting mass murder and insulting the victims. Can I get $1.3M for praying too?
@SenRonJohnson #LawsNotPrayers
@SenRonJohnson Stop "watching" and start fixing.
@SenRonJohnson did you thank @NRA as well?
@SenRonJohnson give back your NRA blood money
@SenRonJohnson hey did you benefit more than  a million$ from gun rights groups? Did ya?
@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson Follow the money, Sen Johnson took more $ from gun lobbyists than anyone else in the senate. He's a lackey for their $.
@SenRonJohnson are u praying for MORE shootings? @nra who pays for your campaigns WANT you inactive, do something!!
@SenRonJohnson Yet another but WHY, why another? Please use your elected position to DO something. Beyond tweeting, we need action.
@SenRonJohnson delete your account
Shocking hypocrite @SenRonJohnson takes huge sums from NRA. Couldn't care less about victims, or he would do something #p2 #uniteblue
@SenRonJohnson All you care about is your "A" NRA rating. You have more blood on your hands!
@SenRonJohnson Let's watch you develop some gun control legislation.
@SenRonJohnson Substitute action for prayer.  Don't hold God responsible for your sins.
@SenRonJohnson SICK and TIRED of yr autopilot response to mass shootings. Your refusal to act on simple, sane reforms enables them. #Enough
@SenRonJohnson #enough
@SenRonJohnson Shame on you for accepting over $1 mil in campaign money from gun rights groups.  I look forward to voting against u in '16.
@SenRonJohnson Yet another tragedy you can stop from repeating. Donate your NRA blood money to @Everytown and support gun legislation.
@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson tragedy that you facilitated with your actions?  NRA loves you, you're one of their best senators
@SenRonJohnson how dare you act surprised that this happens after taking more than a million from guns rights lobbyists. You are enabling
@SenRonJohnson represent my state. I am terrified for myself and my loved ones because of YOUR gun rights. I don't know how you can look
@SenRonJohnson at the deaths of these people and not be repulsed when you look in the mirror, knowing you've been bought by lobbies that get
@SenRonJohnson financial gain from selling tools of death. You can stop this. But you don't. Is it worth it? Is it worth the money?
@SenRonJohnson My prayer today is that you and your ilk are shaken to the core by your hypocrisy until you change #BloodOnYourHands
@SenRonJohnson the repeating tragedy is that we have spineless politicians that think prayer is the best way to solve our mass shooting prob
@SenRonJohnson #EnoughIsEnough stop spewing these shibboleths! Do something! Or better do nothing and resign. Stop wasting taxpayers money!
@SenRonJohnson the blood of these mass murders is on your hands. You have the power to do something to reduce gun violence but choose not to
@SenRonJohnson your thoughts and prayers aren't doing JACK SHIT... its getting insulting at this point
@SenRonJohnson you're a despicable human being. Stop praying and do something.
@SenRonJohnson  maybe you can send 1.3 million prayers. Isn't that the amount thar the pro gun lobby has donated to you?
@SenRonJohnson maybe better gun control would help you redirect your prayers to more positive things? just a thought.
@SenRonJohnson thoughts and prayers don't undo the $1.3 MILLION in blood money you've accepted from gun rights groups you cunt
"Watch the developments," @SenRonJohnson?  You have the power to make a difference, yet you do nothing to prevent mass shootings.
@SenRonJohnson and by developments, you mean more gun murders thanks to your support for long guns?
@SenRonJohnson that psychotic smirk says otherwise
@SenRonJohnson I am praying for politicians who do their job and work for the good of all not just @NRA - do your job!
@SenRonJohnson Your thoughts & prayers mean nothing. You took 1.3 million dollars from the NRA. Stop insulting Americans
@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson DISGUSTING. you've been bought like everyone else.
.@SenRonJohnson Thoughts & prayers are not helping Ron. With over $1.3 million from gun rights groups, you're part of the problem. #GunSense
@SenRonJohnson Yet you've accepted money from gun rights groups and voted against gun control measures.  #confusing
@SenRonJohnson Prayers are all you got? Anything else? What is your plan? More prayers? God's not listening.You have the power.Do something!
@SenRonJohnson your thoughts and prayers wont help the lives lost today, politicians are failing Americans while they die by guns.  Shameful
@SenRonJohnson Maybe the $1.3m you've received from the gun rights industry can buy some funeral flowers.
@SenRonJohnson #saysomethingdifferent
@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson As you continue to do nothing to keep citizens safe. Gun sense now, please.
@SenRonJohnson keep your prayers,  give back the $1 million plus you got from "guns rights" groups and come up with an actual solution
@Astrojanitor @AnnMKrantz @SenRonJohnson examine your conscious, you are soulless.
@SenRonJohnson Oh thats good. Watch the developments. ctrl+C - thoughts and prayers.
@SenRonJohnson NOT ENOUGH. http://gunviolencearchive.org     Your sentiments are hollow, your heart cold. #gunsense @EndNRA  #StopTheInsanity
.@SenRonJohnson Your cowardly thoughts and prayers are not working. Do your job. Stop taking #NRA blood money. #SanBernardino #GunSense
@TallyAnnaE @AnnMKrantz @SenRonJohnson examine your conscious, you are souless
@SenRonJohnson Keep your freaking thoughts & hypocritical prayers to yourself & do something to stop this gun madness!
@SenRonJohnson what are you talking about? You receive millions from NRA. You're part of the problem!!!
@SenRonJohnson What - you're going to pray for God to stop the bullets that the dirty gun lobby money you receive helps keep in circulation?
@SenRonJohnson you are in a position to actually change things, but instead you voted against protecting these people you are praying for.
.@SenRonJohnson Stop taking @NRA $, be bold & actively support, pass serious gun control law. Otherwise, ur thots & prayers are meaningless.
@SenRonJohnson Yes, you will watch as GOP corporatocracy continues to kill people. As for prayer, we all can see how that doesn't work.
@SenRonJohnson your prayers are not going to fix this senator.
@SenRonJohnson instead of offering prayer why don't you offer legislation
@SenRonJohnson Either take a hard line on gun control, or remove yourself from the conversation.
@SenRonJohnson Disgraceful. Return the NRA money now
@SenRonJohnson there aren't words for what a bad person you are.
@SenRonJohnson give back that gun lobby money - will do wonders for your soul
@SenRonJohnson you have power to make a difference. I have power to remind you of that. #nrapuppet #NRAKills
@SenRonJohnson Yet another failure brought on by #NRA owned politicians. Not just a tragedy.
@SenRonJohnson You heartless hypocrites must have "thoughts and prayers" on IM. DO SOMETHING.
@SenRonJohnson your thoughts and prayers will not save people from dying, passing gun regulation will
@SenRonJohnson how much @nra blood money, senator?
@SenRonJohnson Are you really still in the Senate with nonsense like that?
.@SenRonJohnson With a bowl of popcorn? Hope you got a good seat, Senator.
@SenRonJohnson You say sorry just for show.
@SenRonJohnson Are you not tired of "saying prayers"?
@SenRonJohnson prayers are not enough.  Vote for gun controls.
@SenRonJohnson how much $ will you take from NRA before you work on a solution.
.@SenRonJohnson You were not elected to pray and watch.
@SenRonJohnson It's no tragedy. It's deliberate. Thoughts and prayers are just excuses for greed. Reject the NRA. Grow a spine. Fix this!
@SenRonJohnson Why are you accepting money from gun groups? You prayers won't bring anybody back to life, piggy.
@SenRonJohnson you are the problem
@SenRonJohnson We are sick of your meaningless words. Do something about this. Or is your 1.6 million from the NRA standing in the way?
@wistoon33 @JerryLingle @SenRonJohnson you have power to make a difference. I have power to remind you of that. #nrapuppet #NRAKills
@SenRonJohnson BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS!
.@SenRonJohnson In that case, I will be calling your office each day to hear all about these developments you're "watching."
@SenRonJohnson HOW ABOUT USING ALL THAT MONEY YOU GET FROM GUN GROUPS TO PASS SENSIBLE GUN LEGISLATION!  WHAT AN IDEA!
@SenRonJohnson and yet you continue to accept money from gun-rights groups. Your prayers mean nothing. Nada. Zilch.
@SenRonJohnson Even on the disgusting scale of $$$ politicians get from gun rights groups & NRA, your $1.3 million is especially galling.
@SenRonJohnson Congratulations! #SanBernadino wouldn't have been possible without the $1,300,000 you accepted from gun rights groups.
@SenRonJohnson your thoughts and prayers, such a brave response.
@SenRonJohnson I hope this means you will vote to lift the ban in gun violence research
@SenRonJohnson as a mother, nurse & Xian I expect you to pray & act on meaningful reforms. 1+ mass shootings each day in 2015 is ridiculous
@SenRonJohnson oh and I am one of your constituents in WI...not a troll.
@SenRonJohnson You. Are. Culpable.
@SenRonJohnson "Will continue to watch the developments while checking my bank balance." There, I fixed it for you.
@SenRonJohnson By "developments" do you mean you'll watch the campaign $$$ continue to roll in from pro-gun groups? You helped this happen.
@SenRonJohnson this isn't enough for the state of Wisconsin
@SenRonJohnson Hey Ronny--Maybe the tragedies have something to do with guns flowing like water into the hands of loons. But you do NOTHING.
@SenRonJohnson aren't y'all saying church and state are separate? Thoughts and prayers don't change a damn thing. But ACTION does.
“@SenRonJohnson: Yet another tragedy. My thoughts and prayers go out to CA.” How dare you. In a position to help, all you can do is pray.
@SenRonJohnson I too, pray. I pray that congress will be responsible with our lives, and our guns.
@SenRonJohnson Can't wait til you lose re-election!
@SenRonJohnson did you win the NRA lottery? You took $1.3M from them. Your thoughts and prayers are totally helping!!!!
@SenRonJohnson  We need to have universal background checks and safe storage requirements, at the bare minimum! #GunControlNow
@SenRonJohnson - $1.3 million from gun lobbyists. Those are very expensive prayers. Keep watching to see how much more money is coming.
@SenRonJohnson Watch? WATCH?! What the heck are you DOING to stop gun violence?! Your party runs Congress. DO SOMETHING FOR GOD'S SAKE. NOW!
@SenRonJohnson Congratulations on the fruits of you efforts to ensure guns remain widely available and unregulated.
@SenRonJohnson "faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead." James 2:17 NIV #gunsense #sanbernardinoshooting
@SenRonJohnson Stop praying and DO SOMETHING!
You @SenRonJohnson represent me. Ban assault weapons now! Pass meaningful #GunControlNow. Do something to end this slaughter now!
#gunsense
@SenRonJohnson how about you take those thoughts and put them into a comprehensive gun control bill.
@SenRonJohnson Prayer is fake and worthless. Grow a spine and stand up against the #NRA #NRAKills
.@SenRonJohnson I can't wait for .@russfeingold to beat you.
.@SenRonJohnson maybe you should stop taking so much money from guns rights lobbyists then ($1.3 million)
@SenRonJohnson do you think it's time to do something? Guns ARE the problem. I look forward to your response.
