@SenRonJohnson @russfeingold and you know it. A decent person would have crawled back under his or her rock long ago.

@SenRonJohnson The American people already voiced their decision when they elected Obama for four full years. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson there's a reason there is 9 justices and not 8. Court is meant to be unbalanced. Why is my senator a moron?

@SenRonJohnson the American people have already voiced their opinion when they elected Obama twice. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson you really want a Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton to make the appointment for SCOTUS ? Really?
@SenRonJohnson you're eliminating the voice of the voters who elected President Obama. Where does the Constitution say take the last yr off?

@SenRonJohnson since when do we put the #SCOTUSnominee up for popular vote?  I'm pretty sure that is t in the constitution...
@SenRonJohnson You're trying to take away my voice #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson transparent dummy.
