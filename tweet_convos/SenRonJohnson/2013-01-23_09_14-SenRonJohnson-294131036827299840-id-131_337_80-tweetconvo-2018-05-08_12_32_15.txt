@ToneBaloneRocks Sorry about that rant - couldn't help it; too frustrating.  You have the BEST Twitter profiles pics on the planet!
@ToneBaloneRocks  This CAN'T be the best we can do - if it is, then you're too right.  We can do better than this...
How many q-tips did it take to get all her bs out of your ears, @SenRonJohnson? Her response was borderline hysterical.
@FatBaldBearded @senronjohnson senator you embarrassed yourself today, you & your fringe followers continue to chase a ginned up conspiracy
Personally, @CaptainSRogers, I'm quite pleased w/ @SenRonJohnson's line of questions today.
@FatBaldBearded @senronjohnson I'm most tea party, conservative radio listening folks are. Fortunately, that is a small and shrinking group.
I think your superhero tights are cutting bloodflow to yer brain, @CaptainSRogers. The #TeaParty is only getting stronger. @SenRonJohnson
@FatBaldBearded @senronjohnson that's why you got killed in the election, ignoring the facts and living in the conservative media bubble
Really, @CaptainSRogers? While you're basking MSNBC's adoration of PBO's marginal win, try thinking about #Newtons1st. @SenRonJohnson
@FatBaldBearded @senronjohnson 5 million votes an electoral drumming, gained seats in house and senate, all despite GOP voter suppression
@SenRonJohnson you are an embarrassment to Congress-pity WI
@SenRonJohnson Hilary destroyed you.
@SenRonJohnson Support you. You should have ripped into her lies & willful cover up. The American ppl are pissed & tired of this elitist BS
@theobscurant  If @SenRonJohnson genuinely cared, he and McBitter wld've attended the Benghazi briefing. American ppl r sick of GOTea B$!
@SenRonJohnson Both I lost all respect for her n all Democrats at hearings today n all of a sudden Hillary's Campaign Debt is pd in full??
@Lynx60C @senronjohnson Do we know who payed it off?
@mmercedesman @SenRonJohnson no still looking for who ... have idea but I don't say unless have facts
@SenRonJohnson where is your answer on the phony invasion of Iraq on mission of mass weapons? You failed the American people you idiot swine
@SenRonJohnson  Thank's Senator Guilt Away's Raises it's ugly Head
@SenRonJohnson Our enemies fear us less and Our friends fear us more. Hillary that is the difference
@SenRonJohnson more out of context crap RoJo. You got schooled fool.
@SenRonJohnson America is counting on you in Congress to vigorously prosecute Hillary!Don't let this Country witness Hillary walk!
@AgnesphAgnes @senronjohnson - America can't stand you RoJo, no one cares what you do.
What are you going to do about Donald Trump's collusion with Russia?  Get your head out of the sand, and take action!
@SenRonJohnson Hillary states it's a fact that you don't interfere when your Secretary of State to protect US Citizens? WHAT!
@SenRonJohnson The Lies, Nat.Sec.Leaks,DEATHS,Coverups-Stolen Election,FYF & Libya & Overreaches-exec.orders-Why are we not impeaching?
@SenRonJohnson congrats on becoming a leading voice in the Growing Older Party.
@SenRonJohnson - yeah, that's great. Now what are you going to do about it? Hey, why not raise the debt ceiling! Words are pathetic.
@SenRonJohnson don't take her out of context. She kicked your butt
@SenRonJohnson That's either willful ignorance on your part (since you didn't attend the briefing) or cravenly quoting out of context. Ew.
@SenRonJohnson I think it is smug indifference.
@SenRonJohnson Most of all, abject contempt for the dead and for the American people.
@SenRonJohnson Willful ignorance and gross incompetence - sounds like YOUR profile Ron Johnson.
@SenRonJohnson Wow, she'd barely finished answering your provocation before you had this tweeted. Hmmm what does that tell us? #CheapShot
My vote is for 'both' @senronjohnson
@SenRonJohnson #HILLARY #liar #Liberal #Benghazi Who said stand down?I do not want to stoop to low liberal verbiage.U let her run ovr U!
@SenRonJohnson only thing worse is a republican senator sitting on his hands and letting her get away with it. grow a pair ronny
@SenRonJohnson You of Course ROCK Thank You for Defending Freedom Liberty from a Tyrannical Powerful & Corrupt Obama Admn
@SenRonJohnson I estimate it is nefarious indeed
@SenRonJohnson @senronjohnson @Amyloukingery they have lied to the American people, that's what is the difference.
@SenRonJohnson you people need to follow,the laws as WE DO!
@SenRonJohnson well you weren't talking tough when she yelled at you today.  You backed off.  Now you talk smack when she's gone. #benghazi
@SenRonJohnson The difference is - the 4 Americans she and Obama were sworn to serve and protect are now dead and they are still in charge!
@SenRonJohnson She lied Senator. When she said #whatdifferencedoesitmake , U should've called her out! This is serious & WE have NO ANSWERS!
@SenRonJohnson Thank you for speaking out today. You tried, against difficult odds, to get answers. Unfortunately, she is a cunning liar.
@SenRonJohnson I want to see the record where you supported the Iraqi War because of Weapons Mass Destruction-What were you then?
@SenRonJohnson To tweet a complaint about Hilary's response. Is either gutless or childish?
@SenRonJohnson Thank you Sir for your questions and for getting C to illicit her true feelings that in her mind, the truth is unimportant.
@SenRonJohnson either way, she is complicit and should probably do time.
@SenRonJohnson Incompetence without repercussion; quite a feat for a "Public Servant". Her obfuscation won't make it invisible though.
@SenRonJohnson  BOTH AND ARROGANT!!
@SenRonJohnson You are so right Sir.  If you follow #BENGHAZI you will see the full frustration of Americans
Please do not forget these men
@SenRonJohnson good job senator
@SenRonJohnson she's incompetent. she knows everyone wouldn't dare questioning her stupidity.
@SenRonJohnson A little late on that comeback aren't you? #jerkstore
@SenRonJohnson can you ask where the people are that we're evacuated? Why was Ambassador Stevens there to begin with?
@SenRonJohnson That is the callous arrogance of someone who believes herself an elitist. You and I matter no more than the 4 in Benghazi.
@SenRonJohnson Oooo. Yer tough.
@SenRonJohnson You are being too kind, Senator. Of course it was incompetence; she knew what was going on. Congrats to you and Sen. Paul.
@SenRonJohnson what difference does it make? YOU LIED HILLARY.... and OBAMA LIED.... and RICE LIED...  Cover UP.
@SenRonJohnson you got bitch slapped, by a girl! #Whitepaw2016 #NOspin #Banghazi
@SenRonJohnson no Senator you were only trying to score political points against the next President. We know it, you know it. #epicfail
.@SenRonJohnson The ignorance - and incompentence - is on your part.  Your attempt to score political points failed. #GOP
@SenRonJohnson your response that Clinton was "emotional" continues the GOP's need to diminish women. Truth is she is 10x's you-deal with it
@SenRonJohnson Have you seen this @TheRightScoop ? Fantastic job today! http://www.therightscoop.com/hillary-clinton-still-refuses-to-say-benghazi-wasnt-caused-by-the-muhammad-video/ …
@SenRonJohnson hillary was right.you and your party are trying to make benghazi about YOU and YOUR POLITICS when it's NOT.it's about PEOPLE!
@SenRonJohnson your teeth are so brown they look like they're made of wood. #NotReadyForPrimeTime
@SenRonJohnson Does anyone know the last time a Cabinet member was formally charged with dereliction of duty?  Has it ever happened?
@SenRonJohnson not only is he willing to speak out, he is a Packer's fan!!!! I love my state.
@SenRonJohnson you should have told her "the American people deserve the TRUTH"
@SenRonJohnson dont try to spin you getting humiliated to be anything other than that
@SenRonJohnson Hillary & Obama knew well before the election about Benghazi! Both chose to lie!Now It's time to pay the price!
@AgnesphAgnes @SenRonJohnson We knew enough too. We needed a candidate who would lead a charge, not sit down to tea
@SenRonJohnson Incarcerate Hillary for Treason! We know Hillary!So STOP LYING for once in your life!Sen.Lindsey Graham http://awe.sm/e88Rq 
@SenRonJohnson - why didn't you say that to her personally? B/C you know she is neither incompetent nor ignorant.
@SenRonJohnson Americans have waited months for answers and we don't know who issued stand down orders, where was BO, who started video hoax
@SenRonJohnson May I just say, other than you and two others, I found the hearing a waste of time. Softball questions and misleading answers
@SenRonJohnson This is disgraceful stop with the phony compliments.
You all work for us. AS your employer you are all fired.
@SenRonJohnson IT BECAUSE YOU HOLD A GOVERNMENTAL SEAT THAT YOU CANNOT TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LIAR CLINTON. MORE BS FLOWING FM WASHINGTON
@SenRonJohnson Very well said Senator. We want answers for #Benghazi NOW!
"@SenRonJohnson 
You made me proud to be from the south! You done good
@SenRonJohnson Great job Sir!
@SenRonJohnson Senator you and your colleagues failed to ask the two most important questions. If you have to ask you haven't been listening
@SenRonJohnson  You r spending my $$ doing nothing  #STOP PAYING CONGRESS
@SenRonJohnson Thank you Sen Johnson for taking the gloves off with Sec Clinton. Need a lot more though.
@SenRonJohnson  Since when does an investigation of this scope and importance begin at the 'top' as opposed to a 'bottom-up' inquiry?
@SenRonJohnson   We already know it's one of those two.  THE question is what are YOU and your colleagues going to do about this?
@SenRonJohnson @badov49 didn't Hilary say that the buck stops with her?  Alinsky Tactics in full use!
@SenRonJohnson THANK YOU SIR FOR TRYING TO GET THE TRUTH!!
@SenRonJohnson @jtLOL  Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.  #WhatDifferenceDoesItMake
@SenRonJohnson IT'S NEITHER!!  IT IS POMPOUS INDIFFERENCE WITH A HUGE DOSE OF ARROGANCE!!
@SenRonJohnson NOT SO, things were reported before facts were in. And why didn't congress vote for more protection at embassy??
@SenRonJohnson How about the evil intent of using "what-difference-does-it-make" as a tactical ploy to continue the deceit? -PI
@SenRonJohnson #ThankYouSenator
@SenRonJohnson we need the truth Clinton
@SenRonJohnson Clinton's outburst of what diff does it make about Benghazi murders was diabolical but telling. Disgusted how they gush her.
@SenRonJohnson Thank you for taking your job seriously Senator Johnson.
@SenRonJohnson @osPatriot What kind of cold blooded .... could say "whats the diff" abt 4 Am who lost their lives 4 her incompetence?
@SenRonJohnson How about the the second one.
@SenRonJohnson Sen Johnson, Why didn't you tell her what difference it makes and ask about the video?
@SenRonJohnson The PLANED & VERY PHONY OUTRAGE, @HRClinton☭ showed, is despicable & DEGRADES the Office of Secretary of State.  #Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson but you still got elected. How many of those checks were from Fox "News"?
@SenRonJohnson @Njeanous GOP wanted to incite US to fight a WMD reversal pro-war instead “protest” claims killed the chance also NRA sales.
@SenRonJohnson Please tell Sec. of State Clinton tomorrow that per this hashtag #whatdifferencedoesitmake, it makes a difference to US!
@SenRonJohnson Guess Sec. Clinton thinks the difference between life or death and fact or fiction is mere hairsplitting.
@SenRonJohnson wish you would have pursued "who pushed the video, and why for so long". Missed opportunity.
@SenRonJohnson What difference does it make, Ms Clinton? That's willful ignorance or gross incompetence. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFZytEUCXu4 … …OR BOTH, SEN!
@SenRonJohnson Very proud of you today Senator Johnson. BRAVO! Too bad she still lied & wouldn't say why they blamed a video for Benghazi.
@SenRonJohnson I don't know if Hillary thinks you're ignorant or grossly incompetent either. Besides, What Difference Does it Make?
@SenRonJohnson 
Hillary "whenUR in these positions the last thing Uwant 2do is interfere"
Really? I'd say the 4Murdered Ames disagree
@SenRonJohnson Actually its BOTH
@SenRonJohnson disappointed in the 5 minute rule...was a waste of time in my opinion...not enough tough questions and no time for follow-up
@SenRonJohnson Too bad your Republican colleagues(save for Rand Paul) didn't bother to demand accountability at today's hearing.
@SenRonJohnson Here's a post dated 9/13/12 reveals Al Qaeda leader sent out taped threats hours before attacks on 9/11 http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2012/09/the-call-for-911-protests-on-cairo-embassy.html …
@SenRonJohnson hillary told the families they would hold the movie producer Responsible when he had NOTHING to do with it & she knew it
Thank you sir.. @SenRonJohnson for attempting to wade through the garbage that is her testimony.  You have the support of the people!
@SenRonJohnson & @SenJohnMcCain  need 2 retire old white men from the @SenateFloor  Takes time 2 get the facts, don't be ignorant.#Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson A member of the @GOP with courage?  Calling out out Hillary for this outrage?  Mind. Blown.  Thank you.
@SenRonJohnson all she can do is EXPLODE and EVADE ! !   Thnx for asking difficult questions
@SenRonJohnson You guys did not ask anything hard:-( sad,sad,
@SenRonJohnson Great questioning, Senato!.  Keep it up!  Expose dishonesty and incompetence!
Is she going to be definitively answering any more question. I would hope she isn't done. @SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson How about this.... 4 americans are dead and it was on your watch. #Benghazi #TGDN #TCOT
@SenRonJohnson if it didnt matter how come they went around on tax payer dime apologizing to muslims!! They killed our boys with our weapons
@SenRonJohnson  Let me say that I admire your restraint -  my blood boiled with the 'what difference ...'
@Toddger @SenRonJohnson And you are no Johnson, Clinton or even the idiot Durbin.   Mrs Clinton was given full respect  -  she is not a god
@Toddger When I call you a name, you will know it.  I merely commented on your remark  - try to be less sensitive.
@SenRonJohnson you may want to use #WhatDifferenceDoesItMake   would love for it to trend
@SenRonJohnson It makes a HUGE difference!  Americans died due to incompetence & lying 2 American People!  Hold her feet 2 fire! #Benghazi
