@ProudAmerican4 @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan Yet under Obamacare they both would've had free mammograms what's your complaint?

@ProudAmerican4 @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan I guess those above and below those ages would have to pay the co-pay
@kokoshep @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan thought dems were all about everyone is equal...age discrimination??

@Mom2Tali @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj becuz Cruz is wasting his time- it's not a filibuster & will have NO effect on stalling vote?
@ANTIVICTORIA @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj shouldn't be forcing it thru ignoring the voices of the people they swore to listen to.
@Mom2Tali @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj so u think Senate shud change rules becuz Cruz is too stupid 2 understand what a filibuster is?
@ANTIVICTORIA @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj Who said anything about changing the rules?! Only stupid in the equation is those who fail to get it
@Mom2Tali @SenRonJohnson @cspanwj U understand that voting on bills passed thru committee is the JOB of a Senator? U want 2 change that?

@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan Barack Hussein Obama has always remained so out of the league for Policy Making.
@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan We had this debate in 2009!! Republicans are AGAINST everything! Again: Who pays your health insurance??

@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan Senator, #Moratorium? Who pays for your insurance? You didn't answer that question!! #ThanksObamaCare
@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj Education costs have risen because the GOP is systematically defunding it! Why do you lie and lie and lie? #cspanwj
@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan Given that Obamacare remains pathetic, shouldn't the policy making be left to the experts?

@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan - The repubs want welfare for the avg citizen cut but not corporate welfare.
@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan in the 60's conservatives  opposed Medicare, a govt-run program would lead to socialism in America
@criss_chris @cspanwj Excuse me, but Ronald Reagan was right... Medicare/Medicaid has indeed resulted in socialism via Obamacare.
@Sandy_Beach74 @cspanwj so, Sandy what do you propose for a solution?
@criss_chris @cspanwj Stop current implimentation of Obamacare, allow GOP to have input into a new, bi-partisan bill, unlike Pelosi.
@Sandy_Beach74 @cspanwj Okay Sandy, sure, that sounds like a real plan...
@criss_chris @cspanwj It is indeed a real plan. Now, if you could just get any DEM to be bi-partisan...
@Sandy_Beach74 @cspanwj There are glitches in a lot of legislations, refine as necessary...Rep. Jim Moran
There is no question. Trash can it. @SenRonJohnson @fredsgarden @cspanwj @cspan
@SenRonJohnson @cspanwj @cspan if most citizens oppose #obamacare, why are dems so favorable of it?
