@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker Heard you on mark levin show. You have no strategy. Conservatives stand with Cruz and Lee. You don't. #weraware
@SenRonJohnson  Ron you are done in Wisconsin! The sellout of the Tea Party and the behind the door attacks on Ted Cruz has sealed your fate

@SenRonJohnson last time I looked the House keeps including language in a Budget Bill that has nothing to do with the budget. #houseshutdown
@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker You can lay the shutdown at Cruz and Boehners doorstep outrageous excuses for US leaders
@SenRonJohnson there is no inflation the fed can print money to pay for Medicare Is taking care of our parents & grandparents not required?
@SenRonJohnson Pretty sure they are not national parks, so no credit to @ScottKWalker at all. Shame on you & your deceptive statements.
@SenRonJohnson Ok now which is it Obamacare or cut spending You just flip flopped right on national television.
@SenRonJohnson  I glad you admit the shutdown is wrong. reasonable people will discuss issues but not while you extort government workers.
.@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker No, this shutdown is ALL Tea/GOP. Repeating your lie over & over still doesn't make it true. #ShutdownTheGOP
@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker  Confused?  State parks not affected.  #GOPshutdown impacts federal parks. Fix it!  Pressure hose to #justvote
@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker to be fair both sites are to blame Ron.
A pair of #amnesty #Traitors ----->>> @SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker Where's the 3rd one @pryan, the #Failure at VP!
@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker Sen Johnson, just ignore all nasty comments/they're obviously from liberals who blindly follow Obama & cohorts
@SenRonJohnson Why is this not Boehner's shut down?
@SenRonJohnson @SaltyBlackBroad i think u voted for cloture, how's that feelin' now?
@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker Amen !! How blessed we are 2 have such a great/patriotic/heroic Governor !!  Other Governors should do the same
Don't worry about senior citizens not having enough to eat.  They have parks they can go to. @SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker #OneTermTea x 2
Kudos @SenRonJohnson for fighting bill requiring checks to stop gun purchases like Azana Spa killer made before #RonJohnsonpeopledeaths
@SenRonJohnson A supposed senator pulling this #HarryReidsShutdown crap?? Leave that for Reince& aim yourself higher than the Ted Cruz types
@SenRonJohnson @ScottKWalker This was debunked as a lie in yesterday's news. The Twitterverse is too smart for your spin. #GOPshutdown
