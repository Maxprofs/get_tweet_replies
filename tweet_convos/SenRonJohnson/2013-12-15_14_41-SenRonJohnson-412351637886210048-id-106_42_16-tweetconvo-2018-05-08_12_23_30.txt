"@SenRonJohnson: ....I intend to support Ryan/Murray budget deal. http://1.usa.gov/1dg4maZ ” @VickiMcKenna #wiright #witea #budgetdeal
@TamraTellsIt @VickiMcKenna @SenRonJohnson  Why won't Republicans learn to negotiate from a point of strength instead of instantly folding.
@Wyszard1 @VickiMcKenna @SenRonJohnson good question
@SenRonJohnson Economic certainty? We've certainly been screwed, that is & for long enough. Wake up, Senator. Get in ring or get out. #tcot
@SenRonJohnson You sold your soul. you're just as bad as McCain now. so sad...... #killthebill

.@SenRonJohnson How is voting 2 advance a #budget that cuts pensions 2 military retirees&disabled vets providing economic certainty? #tcot

@SenRonJohnson What a slap in the face, We appreciate your support to the military I hope you are voted out of office  #KeepYourPromise
@SenRonJohnson Like I said, YOU are LAZY, or a COWARD. Or a RINO (which makes you both)
@SenRonJohnson Can we please cut spending?  Not ten years out - cut spending this year.
@SenRonJohnson The GOP continues to abandon core principles pushing Progressive big Government and the decay of the USA. #2014midterms #tcot
@SenRonJohnson I thought you were smarter than that!!!
@SenRonJohnson #DefundTheGOP #DefundRove politicians vs We the People #debt #tpp #tcot
@SenRonJohnson Yet another huge disappointment 2 the People. WHY were u elected? Compliance w/ govt or the People? Cut #spending #Debt #tpp
@SenRonJohnson The inordinate spending creates economic instability, genius.
@SenRonJohnson gutless, feckless, impotent.
New #budget deal allows tax increases 2 pass #Senate w 51 vote majority instead of 60

#PJNET #ORPUW #tcot @SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson You people are terrified of Checks and Balances. You obviously support sustaining this out of control government. #GrowAPair
@SenRonJohnson supporting this bill is a vote breaking decades of promises to military retirees. Shame on you.! #budget
.@SenRonJohnson .@Kathy_Amidon LEAD UrParty OnTues! NO BUDGET DEAL W/O FULL O'CARE REPEAL! #NoDealWithoutRepeal #MakeDCListen.
@SenRonJohnson disappointing.  With this attitude we might as well give up. Feel betrayed.
@SenRonJohnson Shut down the government and give me a few million to pay for my cancelled health insurance.  YOU HAVE NO CLUE.  Primary!
@SenRonJohnson @Kathy_Amidon Good for you Senator. Party On.
@SenRonJohnson Typical #frenchrepublicans.  Doesn't know how to fight.  But again, that is the standard of surrender. #toboehner #fold
@SenRonJohnson  I do agree. We need to get the Senate off center and continue working to get spending under control. 54801-1312
@SenRonJohnson thank you Ron. I am behind you and Paul Ryan
@SenRonJohnson -I am amazed you are actually going to support the people of Wisconsin rather than your rich friends!
@SenRonJohnson What's wrong with shut downs? @UniqueName099
@SenRonJohnson Good call Senator!  I agree with you
@SenRonJohnson Only Certainty is bankruptcy. Didn't notice last 'shutdown'.  Too much time in DC?  Corrupted by spending money.
@SenRonJohnson @RacineTEAParty Yet another disappointment - first was your lack of support @SenTedCruz to either defund or delay obamacare
@CTforFreedom @SenRonJohnson @SenTedCruz Get your facts straight...Senator Johnson is for repeal of #Obamacare #Defund was NEVER possible
@SenRonJohnson @RacineGOP In other words you're OK with increasing spending and adding to the deficit? #ShowCourage
.@SenRonJohnson So you're confident that Reid won't raise taxes now that this deal will make it much easier to do so? #simplemajority
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper Tell the people the truth the Tea party candidates that you & the GOP'ers supported are destroying our Country
@SenRonJohnson Listen to @MarkLevinShow destroy RJ. Sounds like such a weak wimp. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taxSw-X4vm8 … #obamacare #rino
@SenRonJohnson You didn't seem to have a problem with the shutdown last time it came to a vote.
@SenRonJohnson Yea the certainty tht we will soon have $20 trillion in debt but it is more important tht you protect the bad job youre doing
@SenRonJohnson Chump move.
@SenRonJohnson A 20% reduction in military benefits is NOT the way to fix the budget. Please rethink this - vote NO! http://freebeacon.com/report-budget-plan-could-cost-service-members-124000-in-retirement-pay/ …
“@SenRonJohnson: To avoid govt shutdowns & provide some economic certainty, I intend to screw taxpayers & veterans" http://1.usa.gov/1dg4maZ ”
@SenRonJohnson  Say it aint so Ron, what no balls
@SenRonJohnson but...the ONLY time anything gets done in Congress is during a shutdown! & how can U cut Vet benefits but NOT entitlements?
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper The econ will cont to be uncertain with ocare.Your yes vote will relinquish your ability to do anything about it!
@SenRonJohnson  Unfortunately, the Dems have the Senate. Minimize the losses.  If we do not take back the Senate, the country is lost.
@SenRonJohnson Conservatives don't cut military retirement 20% AFTER it's been earned. http://kwgn.com/2013/12/12/military-retirees-you-betrayed-us-congress/ … #KeepYourPromise #KeepCOLA
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper didn't 2 inches of snow shut the gov't down last Monday?
Correct tone for vote MT @SenRonJohnson To avoid government shutdowns and provide some economic certainty, I intend to support Ryan/Murray
@SenRonJohnson Reneging on earned compensation to save $6B over 10yrs instead of cutting bloat is disgraceful. #KeepYourPromise #KeepCOLA
@SenRonJohnson Good!
@SenRonJohnson u are a disappointment sometimes
@SenRonJohnson No more photo ops with troops, OK? Broken promises.
@SenRonJohnson @UneditedPol I agree w/U, but some many ppl on here r mad abt deal! I see it as a TEMPORARY fix, avoids shutdowns!
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper THANK YOU SENATOR JOHNSON!  We needed the certainty that our astronomical National Debt will continue to rise.
@SenRonJohnson u're a business man period. I've been watching ur conduct in the senate. While I dont oppose the bill I hope u leave the sen.
@SenRonJohnson: "To avoid shutdowns & provide econ certainty, I support Ryan/Murray budget" ... that screws Mil Vets. http://1.usa.gov/1dg4maZ 
@ColMorrisDavis @SenRonJohnson #KeepYourPromise
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper thank you from a small business in Illinois.
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper the only certainty when you deficit-spend 40 cents on dollar is eventual financial pain. Forget politics! THINK!!
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper well you just lost your credibility with me.
Thank you! @SenRonJohnson: "To avoid government shutdowns and provide some economic certainty, I intend to support Ryan/Murray budget deal."
@SenRonJohnson Congrats, you're officially in the Ruling Class now, Mr. Everyman. Say "Hi" to Speaker Pelosi for me.
@SenRonJohnson @jaketapper booooo.  We want a pitcher, not a belly itcher.  We want a pitcher...
@SenRonJohnson you lost my vote rino!!!
@SenRonJohnson well that is a shame
@SenRonJohnson I hear you. We need to avoid another shutdown at whatever cost; don't let the rabble get you down
@SenRonJohnson Thank you!
@SenRonJohnson You mean the certainty that you'll bury our children under more debt?
@TeaPartyExpress let's see what you're made of!  We need someone to primary @SenRonJohnson! @gop @gopconference @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader
@SenRonJohnson Changing the rules after sacrifices have been made is unconscionable. No excuse. #KeepYourPromise Protect military retirement
@SenRonJohnson supports Ryan/Murray budget deal to avoid govt shutdowns and provide economic certainty. Kudos! http://1.usa.gov/1dg4maZ 
“@SenRonJohnson: To avoid (having backbone) and provide (debt to my children) I intend to support Ryan/Murray budget deal.
@SenRonJohnson about time you found something you could vote for.
@SenRonJohnson  Oh. Like that's the ONLY deal which can be made? I see...
@SenRonJohnson   Disappointed but not surprised.  After all you supported funding Obamacare.
@SenRonJohnson Not surprising, RINO. Give up the spending cuts achieved in sequester, add on a few more billion in debt... No biggie, right?
@SenRonJohnson Why didn't you want to avoid the first govt shutdown, if shutdowns are bad?
