And by Potus u mean"help do wut's right 4 r country & it's citizens & listen to wut THEY need despite political affiliation or potus agenda"
#askingforafriend
You are not fighting for the workers, You are fighting for corporations and the rich,
I'd rather you listened to your constituents and advanced OUR agenda. Hold a town hall meeting and find out what we're concerned about!
guuurl, you crazy. He has better things to do like...um...and then...um...so then there's that stuff and stuff.
Gurl, you crazy.
Yeah I know....Ron's super busy stroking potus's......ego.
I mean, stroking his ego IS a full time job.
“It is abundantly clear that the tactics employed by the minority party are designed to imperil the new administration and it’s agenda.”
Isn't that what happens in a 2 party political system?..almost by definition. One party does not aid & abet their opponent's agenda usually.
But the words are just stunning given Republican obstruction during Obama’s tenure. I mean, this is just openly flaunting hypocrisy. Wow.
The bold-faced lying infuriates me...and you know a third of the country is eating this shit up with a spoon.

We learned it by watching you GOP. #HypocrisyInAction #HypocritesAndLiars

Please don’t!
Since you're offering to work 24/7, there's no excuse for an entire week in recess without a townhall. What else are doing at 3AM?
Remember these Ron? The ‘problem’ isn’t just on the Left! Look in the mirror.  Thanks for choosing the swamp over the good decent hard working people in WI.  Shameful.
POTUS agenda? Divide the Nation? Ruin our credibility? Do you not hear or see the Lies? The Unbecoming Conduct?
thanks Sen Johnson, we need some wins! Keep Working! @dennishemauer
You have no HEART slashing  Medicaid by $1T, Medicare by $500B, &  other working family priorities just so the1% can get BIG tax cuts. SHAME
I thought you were so concerned about balancing the budget!
YOUR GOP Tax Reform will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit!!!
#RussianSanctions What's the hold up?  Putin's puppet?
JOHNSON IS A TRUMPIAN LICK SPITTLE.
I would rather subsist on nothing but cotton balls than see @POTUS’s agenda advanced
You mean u support that draft dodger and lout in the WH? Ronny, u r showing u r a lout too.
No.

It's Monday! How about getting off Twitter & for a change do some work? Those #RussianSanctions aren't going to implement themselves! 
Let's work 24/7 to remove from office clowns like both of you, @VP, @SenateMajLdr, @SpeakerRyan, @ScottWalker, @SpeakerVos, @SenFitzgerald.
You want to destroy America? That is the POTUS agenda. WAKE UP! This POTUS is the most UNFIT,CRAZY,"#DANGEROUS President EVER .Imp B4 2late
.@SenRonJohnson @POTUS Should we support Pebble Mine agenda item? Ron, do u supp PM? How bout $$ for EPA Pruitt security. #TrumpDossier Sad.
Yes absolutely. Seems everyone has deadlines EXCEPT Congress. #DoYourJob

But some economists say the White House's math rests upon a shaky foundation. http://n.pr/2yJ2GZK 
Hypocrite
Obstructionism!? You mean like Merrick Garland?
“That’s not my problem. I've got my own things I’m trying to concentrate on, OK?”
Wow you must not want to run for office again. Support for Drumpf = brings your end. We stand against tyranny not progress it. #IMPEACH45

NEW: Uninsured rate is rising under Trump http://washex.am/2l2M6kF  
Unprecedented??!?!?  I point you to the Republican obstructionism during the Obama administration.  Seriously Senator?

And yet Senate ended work on Thursday and next vote not until 5:30PM Monday night. How about at least working a full week?!
“Perversion of senate rules” from the guy whose party threw out hundreds of years of precedent to block and then confirm a SCOTUS judge
And your party's perversion of the Merrick Garland confimation?How soon you forget your own sins, @SenRonJohnson . Stolen Supreme Curt seat!
Let's not.
You must be very happy the gerrymandering has not been corrected yet to keep your job! You did not win by much, remember that
Wisconsin is made up of mostly middle class or poor, not the rich. But money talks right? Loud and clear.
LOL. Yeah, because Republicans never have engaged in obstruction in Congress.
This blame game is so old. Reach across the aisle, if not, you are a fool and in it for you and Your rich cronies...sick of this!
Did you ever hear the phrase "reinventing the wheel"? Well, then you understand you shouldn't do it!
Who are you kidding Johnson? The dems are not doing this. Nice to try to pass the buck. We need the ACA reforms, not a new bill.

Congress using borrowed money for a tax cut? Much of the money goes to top 1% who don't need a tax cut? Fiscal conservatives are disgusted.
At least one Senator is working!
Hopefully you will publish a list of cheap cat food so Medicare & Medicaid recipients can budget for the cuts you are making.
WRONG ROAD, DRUMPISM IS DOOM FOR AMERICA.  TAKE, THE HIGH ROAD AND IMPEACH THE MENTALLY ILL @POTUS
@potus agenda is military rule and segregation- which seems to match Wisconsin GOP
Wisconsin Shows How To Do Voter Suppression Right http://bit.ly/2znzSFt  
Let's not

The GOP budget will increase the deficit by $1.5 tr over 10 years. And it just passed the Senate.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/10/19/republicans-have-the-budget-votes-they-need-but-democrats-prepare-to-make-it-painful/ …


Excuse me, but what happened to all the deficit hawks? https://twitter.com/loriamontgomery/status/921197906622808066 …


Tax cuts for the 1% like the Koch Brothers! $473 Billion cut to Medicare! $1 Trillion cut to Medicaid and add $1.7 Trillion to the deficit!!
All are waiting for their pay checks from those 1%.
Potus agenda. No thanks. I don't support policy that strips people of their civil rights, healthcare, & kills our environment.
This is coming from a party that refused to vote on a SC nominees. Hypocrites
Puke
This “POTUS” has no real agenda other than tweeting us in to a nuclear war. Perhaps your time would be spent protecting the world FROM HIM!!
Please grow a brain Mr. Johnson before everything Single Wisconsinite votes you out of office!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’
No, let's not.
The GOP held the government hostage for 6 years by obstructing EVERYTHING. Now you want free reign to pass all your favors to the rich?
Ron Johnson is scum get out office now
Seriously, what does this collection of words mean? You’re willing to attend scheduled sessions? Willing to vote? Hooray, I guess?
your job is to advance OUR AGENDA...not his, not yours.  do your job, your payouts to the rich will be erased as you all are removed
Ron, you have it wrong.  No more secret meetings. It is not the minority party that is the problem.  It is YOU
Ah yes, let's try pushing through terrible legislation at 4am when the public isnt awake to be outraged.
No fucking thanks.
Don't make the Senate horny all the time
You cant confirm cabinet posts that are not nominated. Talk to SOS Tillerson to nominate State Dept professionals.
How about you work to advance the agenda of the people instead of the POTUS who has a 36% approval rate.
What @potus? You mean the racist traitor that you support? @housegop @senategop

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Probably faster than people can read and reflect on what's being voted on of course. Best way to do it. #sarcasm
better get shit done quick as possible b4 ppl figure out election process lost its integrity!Cookin books not gonna work anymore Ronnie Boy!
Remember Merrick Garland, Senator?
When are you doing a real town hall @SenRonJohnson? I'd love to hear you talk about this. I love cramming legislation through 24/7.
Because trickle down is working so well now in the poorests states.  You are a male submissive with a red ball in your mouth.
Merrick. F'ing. Garland.
The party of obstruction was GOP,starting with both Speakers'vows to make Obama a one term president (failed) and ending with Garland block
Since then GOP has riffed on that theme. and have become so addicted, they now obstruct their own party and especially, interests of voters!
It is now past time to turf Ron Johnson and his party soulmates, to give the voters representation of their needs and to build the USA!
Nope
Got another check in the mail, huh?
Clusterfuck
Trump's agenda is broken and marching faster with fundamentally flawed Trump nominations is harmful to everyone.



Trump’s pick for the USDA’s chief scientist isn’t a scientist at all – he’s a homophobic radio host 




You’re awfully vocal against “minority party” obstruction now that your re-election is subject to voter suppression scrutiny. Distraction?
"Obstruction"? The GOP spells that M E R R I C K G A R L A N D
I would have to divorce my husband, sell my house, or pay $336 month for healthcare! Think about me, next time you go to the doctor.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO FREAKING GREEDY? SERIOUSLY? KILLING YOUR AMERICAN CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE A BUCK! CLASSY @SENRONJOHNSONJESUS WOULD BE PROUD!
THE NERVE AND HYPOCRISY OF A REPUBLICAN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT OBSTRUCTION WHEN YOU ALL BROKE THE RULES TO DENY PRES OBAMA HIS SUPREME COURT NOM!
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A DIRTY MOBSTER WORKING FOR AN ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATE
THE 1%
YOU COULD NOT CARE *LESS* ABOUT AMERICA OR ITS CITIZENS!!
Let's not hurt the poor, middle class and elderly.
So you and your rich buddies can line your pockets more? You are a leech, and literally the last person who should talk about “hard work”.
Yea lets not, only out for himself and the other 1% and I am guessing you are the same. He is a pig and I support NOTHING he stands for
No thanks. As you well know, a majority of the country opposes his greedy, hateful agenda.
Ron, How does it feel that we're paying for your health care? When I can't afford $336 a month for healthcare! Cuz my husband has a pension!
Seems you should be worried about constituents not @realDonaldTrump !
Nah. We’re good. Well, we’re not, traitor, but his agenda is shit.

 “Trump isn't telling the truth about his tax plan. So I am.”
“Obstruction”, really? GOP Senate knows all about that for 8 years of practice!! No, this is not payback, it’s called doing the right thing.
We are so fucked. The @GOP cares nothing for American's
Be an adult & take responsibility for the situation you created. Instead of doubling down on partisanship, work to rebuild senate integrity.
Why does the tax plan cut healthcare??
The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 
#GoNuclear
That sure would be great, @SenRonJohnson
Why is the admin hiding data from the public?
As Richard mentions, Treasury deleted its own study showing most corporate tax cuts go to profits, not labor income. Orwellian stuff. https://twitter.com/RichardRubinDC/status/919868928763088896 …
How about we advance the PEOPLES agenda and not something that only favors the rich and powerful?
Please don't.
Please don’t
Let's not. His agenda both is morally repugnant AND poor policy.
