Not enough to make statements.  Get in the trenches and work this out for Americans.  No recess for congress until they engage each other.
Why don't u come up with a bill that gives all Americans good health care not just 4 the wealthy and politicians?
I'm 63, cant get medicare and saved so not qualified for medicaid. After 30yrs no sick days get dx with cancer. #acha will kill me, vote no
#FullRepeal ....That's what Americans that put @realDonaldTrump in office voted for! Thank you for not supporting Obamacare Lite!
So what are you 'concerned' about and what are you not?  Talk in detail..we need to know exactly where you stand.
Says the man who thinks pre-existing conditions are the fault of the people who have them. My son totally got cancer on purpose. #Clueless
We CANNOT allow defunding of CDC + fed immunization progs by $1billion"prevention & public health fund"(#pphf).Would lead 2 deadly pandemics
Deadly pandemics is too much drama. Get real
your evil if you think kids responsible. forCANCER HA U A SENATOR 
After the shit you've said about pre-existing conditions I highly doubt you will vote no on this bill
Thank you
My mom...born and bred in WI...worked hard her entire life, sacrificed...would lose her coverage. This bill is anti-human. #VoteNO
What are your thoughts now that the CBO score is out sir?
Thank you, Senator! Please vote NO
Pharm & insurance companie and the wealthy don't need tax breaks. Poor children & disabled need help much more. Insurance for all.
I'm a disabled WI resident with many pre-existing conditions. My grandson also just had part of his lung removed 5 days ago. PLEASE vote NO
I don't think he wants to insure people with pre-existing problems.
Well if he votes yes he's gonna lose a lot of votes come election time!!! Praying we can get rid of @ScottWalker next election too!!!
We're holding you to that statement!
I'll love you statement when I see your NO vote on the healthcare death panel bill. Until then I don't trust you.
Then please vote no!
Vote no to this bill. I have a pre-existing condition and no I did not crash my car. Check and see if you have a heartbeat.
Wasn't 8 years long enough to figure out what the American people need.   We need positive action not more stalling
Losing our votes is not a bluff either. #futureformersenator
It rips Insurance from 115,000 Wis. folks which c/ result in 1 death/300 of them per year for.. Ins Co. CEO tax cuts?
My @NewYorker piece on How the Senate’s Health-Care Bill Threatens the Nation's Health. http://bit.ly/2tf717d 
How does this help with negotiations like this?  http://standtallforsmall.org/ 
Thanks for working for people of Wisconsin!
Sometimes, in order to achieve goals, you have to take as leap of faith.
WE DONT WANT ANY PART of OCARE! Let it die! If it's NOT a repeal VOTE NO! @SpeakerRyan is still slipping coverage for illegals in it! NO
And speak for yourself, my family and many other Wisconsin family's depend on ACA
Oh please. Prove to me your paying your $5000 deductible and receiving services.
We need market stability not to repeal and replace
We CANNOT eliminate the current pre-existing conditions part of the current law. Why not LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS FOR A CHANGE, Ron?
the healthcare scam is not gonna be better for anyone. Complete repeal. But if Gop to survive pass it
Sorry to hear that  I support Trump but the republicans are making Schumer the head of the Senate. He keeps his 48 a controlling force
So 'doing nothing' is in our best interest? Remember why you ran and why we voted for you. Vote YES. Let's start to end Obamacare
Don't sign it, you'll hurt millions of people. Think before you act.
there is NO WAY this is good for WI people. we expect your NO vote
Thank you, Senator Johnson, for caring about millions of Americans across the country, for whom this matter is literally life and death.
I'd prefer a strong "No", but this is a start
As a WI constituent, I want you to vote NO. This bill is a disaster for WI families. It lets my private insurance have a lifetime cap! No!
THIS MAN IS #1 dumb #2 doesnt care!
Please don't let my family lose healthcare, without protection for pre-existing we would suffer #VoteNoACHA
Keep to your guns you know it is a harmful bill.  We voters will remember your stand on this!!!
your vote will show if you can be trusted.
is it true you don't believe people with pre-existing conditions deserve insurance? I was born with a heart defect. Probably healthy than u.
Compare this bill to what those other nation citizens enjoy: saving what would be over ONE TRILLION DOLLARS /yr!, better care, no red tape,
More citizens in 15 nations have had  BETTER healthcare results than USA for decades 
AT HALF THE COST! Why do we not just copy success?
Any healthcare bill should include, congress must take the same plan they vote for America and no longer be covered by taxpayers of America!
After the op-ed, this dog and pony show of yours and your "on the fence" fellow Rep senators fools no one. The political price's HIGH. Trust
Please, PLEASE stick to this. I'm sure McConnell will offer small cosmetic changes to get you on board - please don't fall for it!
but you said...
https://twitter.com/politicangst/status/879235010036867072 …
It's not in anyone's best interest. Please vote NO.
Thanks it is also in the best interest of America. Please keep your moral compass headed in the right direction and vote no on this bill.
Why not? People in WI have lost everything else. You're simply pandering now. No pre-existing conditions in WI? A 500% increase is good? 
Vote yes or I WILL NOT vote for you ever again!
It's a bluff
Stand tall--the average and working class Americans need you to help make health care better not rich people, richer.
As care manager to a brother with ALS and a mother with dementia/stroke PLEASE dont support this bill or any other that cuts Medicaid!
Vote NO. It is the only way to protect your citizens. You have the chance to do the right thing and really do something good for people.
The gop has had 7 years to come up with a healthcare bill. 7 years !!! We can't screw this up
You said: "if people can't afford insurance, they don't deserve it." You don't deserve to be a Congressman with that attitude!
You said, "people w/preexisting conditions are like used cars that have been in an accident & deserve to pay more for insurance..." Bull.
my 29 yr. old kid employed full time at a job with no benefits. Rent, car pay,& ins. take most of it, premium increase no way
Thought you may be in lock-step with fellow GOP senators, happy you're not!  Thanks for being caring for us.  Really!
A Wisconsin resident urges you to vote NO!
You should be thinking whats best for all on something as important as this. 

But do as you must

I'm in a sanctuary City saying defund us
Why r u so callous. Why does Wisconsin tolerate ur nasty attitude towards health care.What happened to ur great state to put a man like u in
How could you POSSIBLY think this cruel monstrosity of a bill could be "in the best interest" of people in Wisconsin?!?
I CALL BULLSHIT!
It MUST include protection for pre-existing conditions. Holding out for GR8R cuts to the ACA can't be tolerated.
You're going to vote yes, and thousands of folks in Wisconsin will die prematurely as a result. We will remember thru 2022.
Was voting to allow more coal waste in streams and rivers in the best interest for folks in Wisconsin? Please explain.

It never will be, just get past party and realize Obamacare is actually pretty decent for what it is...work on fixing it's deficiencies...
55 yo nurse in Montgomery, AL with pré-existing. Thank you for considering people before party.

Our #veterans, who answered the call to defend their nation, face a life or death battle to protect their health care from the #Republicans 
So you just want it to be more 'mean & lean;' got it.  My 2 sibs with Diabetes & 2 with Multiple Sclerosis really appreciate your efforts!
So you're against it because it doesn't kill enough Wisconsonites?
Well where have you been for the last 8 years! Promising a repeal of OCare!! You guys are feckless and cowards! Can't stand up and fight!

Fix ACA problems stop 45/congress from blocking ins payments and allowing ins CEOs profiting at USA patient expense. Who pays 4 your HC?
And by doing so, you're also doing what's best for my SC family, friends and neighbors!

Stay strong !
I am admittedly skeptical. Please stick to your first instinct. This bill is terrible for the citizens of WI and everyone else.
You are a snake that crawled out from under a rock!
We have different opinions on politics but I'm begging you for everyone who will lose please vote no. My mom will die. She can't afford this
You said you would note vote yes.  Vote NO!  Do not cave!
Will you be persuaded?
Are you not voting yes because it is not harsh enough? Just wondering... You are with the Freedom Caucus.
He phrased it you should be taking money out each year. He could of said gradual tax cuts for the wealthy. So yeah harsher measures.
Nobody said you're bluffing, We said you're lying. This drama ends in you taking credit for nominal change, voting yes & hurting people 
Please stand with your WI01 constituents & vote NO on this heartless 'bill'.
High risk pools are not in our best interest.
It's not in our best interest. Doesn't make health care more affordable, eliminates our protections. Vote NO.
I hope Senator Johnson is not bluffing and actually in pursuit of massive tax cuts for wealthy GOP donors.
holding you to that, @SenRonJohnson
I hope you are being sincere senator. This is more about people than parties.
Should insurers be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions?
Please vote NO. Wisconsin lives and families depend on it.
B/c instead of being voices for the people, they DID NOTHING TO FIX IT. Health care should be free, but it's going to take time & effort
And once again a reminder that your state hosts literally the largest electronic medical system vendor in the US. Their success depends...
on hospitals having the margin to invest in HIT. Said margin isn't going to exist if everyone is going to ER for care they can't afford.
There's no doubt AHCA will be terrible for Wisconsin.
Walker will use this to screw us Wisconsinites hard.  You know it.  I know it. Please pull through with a no vote, Senator.
This is the first time I'm not mad at you. Thank you. This bill will hurt WI. We can't have this.
Whoa, Ron.
be courageous & stand strong. This bill will KILL Americans. Wisconsin lives matter more than party politics.
You should not now or EVER pass this #HealthcareBill it is cruel, callous and only benefits the wealthy. Someone needs to stand up!
Medicaid cuts will be a disaster for millions, including special education students in Wisconsin. Vote "no." The bill is an atrocity.
you have no credibility. Vote no AND prove your no is not because this bill is not cruel enough for you.
Well, you know it's good for the rich investor class. What else is there to consider?  No-brainer for a good Repub.
Good for you!
Rest assured - it is not.  The poor, disabled, no caps-it will cause irreparable harm.  Please do the right thing & vote no.
Please, you'll cave and vote yes no matter how shitty the CBO score. Demand hearings.
@NHFTHF 
It is not in the best interest for folks in America & will never be in current format. Your ''no'' is saving #Wisconsin lives!
Very well.  You have my support.  Thank you
cmon everyone knows it's bluff. You're not fooling anyone. You'll vote for this bill no matter what amendments are added.
hang in till  satisfied SENATOR  we  trust your Judgment! Don't buckle under ANY pressure! Do the right thing 4 us
There has been enough insanity lately. There must be public hearings, debate and compromise! This is 1 country, and laws must be for all
Please vote no. The wealthy do not need the tax cuts, and my family needs the insurance coverage. Please work w dems to fix what is broken
Glad to hear it.
Please vote No, I'm seeing little in this bill that is in my best interest.  Thank you.
There are a lot of other voters who want to get rid of Obamacare, lower taxes and get better jobs! If you have a better idea, go for it.
Sir I voted for you & Repubs to Replace & Repeal OCare. You told us you would. If you don't, you have lost my vote.
Thank you
Thank you!  It would be nice to see some transparency.  What is in this bill?
What will buy his vote is high-risk insurance pools for people with preexisting conditions. And I thought you were principled.
... done now. Not doing so is simply not an option!  Once O'care is gone you can negotiate further/necessary reforms. So keep your promises!
..
Better. That's what the Dems planned to do and it would have sealed the deal on O'care forever. But then came Trump. So do what can be ..
... the best legislation on the planet but you have to end Obamacare and replace it, period. Then you can get right back to work making it..
Then Obamacare will remain. Promises made must be promises kept. We are smarter than you think and know that the replacement bill won't be..
Trumpcare will kill folks in Wisconsin. I hope you will do the right thing and vote no.
Thank you Seen Ron Johnson I'm glad some Republicans aren't without merit
We will hold you to this Senator. I hope you mean the working folks in Wisconsin not just the rich.
Thank you for protecting Wisconsin citizens!  The bill needs time, debate and adjustments.  Too important to be rushed. @SenRonJohnson #acha
But don't just say it. Mean it. Can't be good for Wisconsin or the US.
The more burden the 99% carry, the fewer customers! Simple math.
The cuts to Medicaid will be devastating to my disabled child. A WI family. She will DIE without her seizure meds..$3000/month is the cost..
We shouldn't buy insurance anymore. We should buy healthcare. Based on a healthy life style. Screening and everyone benefits equally.
PLEASE VOTE NO!!! This bill is not in the best interest of any Wisconsinite or American!!
Supporting and voting for @realDonaldTrump wasn't in the best interest of Wisconsin but you did it anyway... so.... there's that.
As a WI resident, I ask you to please protect us, and vote against this bill.
Way to go Senator Johnson, holding out for something more Conservative. We still need Repeal and Replace for Obamacare is failing.
It doesn't matter whether the bill is "conservative" or "liberal". If it takes health insurance from millions, it's no good
I'll believe it's not a bluff when you vote "NO". #IAmAPreexistingCondition (almost 1/2 your constituents do)
It is not in the best interest of me and my fellow Wisconsinites. Please vote no.
If you don't want preexisting conditions as part of the bill, what happens to them?  What do you want to happen for those people?
Johnson's defended ever lie of Trump .. can't believe a word a of this guy ...
Great choice
It will never be good enough for any citizen of this country. It lets thousands fall through every year. Dead! #notachristianbill
Working in health care l can appreciate your leadership on Medicaid thank you.
Thank you, Senator Johnson!  As an MS Activist & your constituent, PLEASE, VOTE NO! #MSActivist @tammybaldwin
Thank you Senator 4really taking time 2understand the implications of this bill. Represent the people not blindly follow party.
He understands that HIS TAX CUTS & those for the wealthy are substantial, so he's happy with it. It sucks for the low income people
You do understand that he does not find it quite cruel enough yet,I trust.#Trumpcarekills
Yeah, just sharing information.
My kids' lives depend on you standing up against this bill. Tax cuts for the rich @ the cost of poor lives will NEVER be worth repealing ACA
Please DO NOT vote YES!
You mean, until you decide if it is in the best interest of YOU, you will not vote yes. We the silent minority vote. Do not be stupid.
Respectable attitude!Would you please define what you mean by"in the best interest for folks in Wisconsin"?As other R senators think this is
IF you're not lying, then you will NEVER vote yes for any such Confidence Scheme.  AHCA = Mean(ACA). Both will fail for the same reason.
Well done Senator!   Stand up to 45 and these horrid Medicaid cuts.
Not finding a way to yes leaves us with Obamacare. You need to get all your fellow Senators to tell the facts like you did on Morning Joe
Thank you sir - we need #FullRepeal
So the folks in Wisconsin are more important than other millions of Americans? No excuses at his point. Ridiculous!
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator. Please provide a short list of objective criteria you’re using so we can play along at home.

high risk pools for those with pre-existing conditions will likely be too expensive for many to afford.   #mean
I'm glad you feel this way. Stand strong. Unfortunately, this bill will never be in the best interest of anyone besides uber rich and corps
There are no professional medical organizations supporting this bill, and most major insurers are against it. 15-28k unneeded deaths anually
This is a heartening message. Now, can you commit to understanding and defining what "best" is with you constitutes? Let them define that.
Thank you, please stand strong for a #FullRepeal
Republicans had better (figratively) hang together to get things done or they will hang separately in the 2018 election.
Repeal YES, but not this to replace.
I hope this isn't because it doesn't take enough away from us. People with pre existing conditions need guarantees on coverage
I appreciate the sentiment, but what you consider "in the best interest" remains to be seen. Best for who, billionaire corporate owners?
Taking insurance away from 23 million americans (many of them in WI) is not in their interests.  Vote NO on AHCA.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Police drag away protesters, some in wheelchairs, outside of Sen. McConnell's office after draft of Senate health care bill is revealed 
Good, MAJOR CHANGES MUST BE MADE.
yeah sure.
I will pass judgment once we see how you define what is best for the people of Wisconsin.
Hopefully you don't "change your mind" after a backroom deal or some amendment that won't change the bill hardly at all. #Bluff
Want experts?! Like really?!
NOONE. TRUSTS. YOU. OR. YOUR. PARTY. and we will be holding the @GOP accountable. You are complicit in all of this. The @GOP must go ...
Thank you. But I think we don't like this bill for different reasons.
This is a total Democrat mess. Let it die it's own natural death so we never try something so stupid ever again.
I agree. Universal/Single Payer Health Care is the obvious solution.
It's so obvious it never works. Just like Marxism in general.
