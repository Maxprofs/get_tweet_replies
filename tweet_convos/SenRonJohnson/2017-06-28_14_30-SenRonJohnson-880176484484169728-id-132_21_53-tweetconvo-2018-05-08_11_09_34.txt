Senator, your CBO claim is an outright lie. CBO itself called it "A Desperate move by a Desperate body to justify a bad bill"
Correction, I mean Obamacare is simply wrong for the American people.
And 800 Billion in Medicaid CUTS is STILL 800 BILLION in Medicaid CUTS.

#UniteUsNow

When is your next real town hall meeting.

Rethink the "manufacturing" model. Healthcare is a must have. Free market will not make care affordable in time for those who need it now.
You don't want to 'save' anything. You want to beat us back into 3rd world status. That much is obvious now. The @GOP deserves Trump.
Then start paying for it.  Your mind is in this dark little hole of 'Insurance'  when healthcare shuldn't b insurance. It IS an entitlement.
Garbage in, garbage out. Let's vote you out.  Government is not a business

Current plans put coverage out-of-reach for low-income ppl who depend on #Medicaid for care. RT: @SenateGOP vote NO! 
it seems you want dems back in control of congress

As someone who oversaw Medicaid for 2 years, cutting $800 billion+ does not "strengthen" it.

It damages it severely.

Medicaid & CHIP cover 74M+ Americans. Swipe to learn why it's essential that health care reform keeps them funded. https://twitter.com/PatientAction/carousels/875746346476687360 …
You don't need a Trillion dollar tax cut for rich to do that ...you look pathetic...

You are a money grubbing liar. People will lose coverage #GOPHealthcareIsMurder
The reason Medicaid had doubled more elderly. I guess you'll put them on the streets in their hospital gowns #GOPHealthcareIsMurder
I'll believe it when I see it. You are all party over people. Another Trumpet, walking us all over the cliff. I live in your district. 

.@USCBO est. Senate's plan leaves 15M more people uninsured next yr than current law. RT to tell @SenateGOP NO! 
What about the #BabyBoomers future if there isn't SS or Medicare?
PAID IN FOR 40+ YEARS .... GIVE US BACK ALL OF OUR MONEY!
Fix #ACA and pass a bill that officially nicknames it #GOPcare.
Keep it and take the political win!

Your care is in the hands of your Senators. Tell @SenateGOP we need sustained coverage & access to quality care. RT #ForOurPatients! 
Saving medicaid means giving billionaires tax cuts so they can buy an extra yacht and removing healthcare from the needy.  Some future.
Liar! Again,I don't have kids&don't want 2 pay school tax 4 others, same difference right? #TrumpCareKills #SavetheACA Fix it don't kill it!

Police showed up to arrest these disability activists. They got schooled on Trumpcare instead.

GOP health bill: 16% approve

Cut Planned Parenthood: 80% oppose
Medicare 4 all: 60% approve

Johnson doesn't seem to realize he's in office to service the will & best interests of the majority. This "healthcare" bill serves the 1%.

Senator I am with you! Please work to expand health care and not take away Medicaid.
I'm in manf 2??Would love to understand the make up of your Kaizen team and the root causes will be analyzed. #enoughbuzzwordsmorecontent

Enthusiasm for GOP's healthcare bill is low (and falling) among Trump's own base: 
h/t @Morning_Joe 

What America thinks. 

That's what why a American version of single payer system that will cut healthcare cost in 1/2 is required!

Just read about a heartbreaking story on your Facebook page.  Actually there are many!  Have you read one???
Post these videos on your Facebook page so ALL know where you stand with Wisconsinites!

Everything is a nonstarter w/o promised #FullRepeal of #Obamacare NO entitlements! NO subsidies! NO Medicare expansion! #FreeMarket #Debt
I don't believe that cuts to MA won't hurt disabled...look how Texas has cut therapy services for disabled kids!
And you want to kill Americans so that you can send millions of dollars to your rich friends.
#Trumpcare kills
#TrumpCareKills
You need to stop lying.  You are SOLELY  out for the tax benefits for the rich folks.  You could care less about citizens & health care.
I thought you said you cared about the costs:
Obamacare vs. Trumpcare: The same Obamacare policy under Trumpcare costs 74% more.

Gov stealing from us - taking our $ and giving it to the rich, and giving us nothing in return. Isn't that supposed to by opposed by GOP? 
Medicaid is fine we do not need to dismantle it which is what the current bill does. We cannot cut our way to prosperity or good health.
In you town hall you said many times that lower healthcare costs are the answer. That means preventative care.
http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/senate-gop-health-care-surrender-watch?utm_content=buffer9b73e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer …  Yeah.... but what he actually wants is to ensure that expensive people die quicker.

Uncle Donny's Snake oil.


YEAH, I THINK U ARE FOS!! ONLY WISH U WERE SINCERE!!  SORRY, BUT ALL PSALM SINGING HYPOCRITES!!
That's not what the republican bill does.
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING U SAY!!  BS!!
The Free-Market has ass-all to do with good healthcare, let me cite my evidence: Every Other Fucking Country on Earth!

Is there anything more unpatriotic than taking care away from those who fought for our freedoms? #HealthcareBill #BRCA 
You are a tool for the elite. I say you should be taken off of your own health care and inherit the one you are proposing.
Why not mortgage their future, you don't mind if our children drink poison water
Please get the students loans and the financial aid system out of the current Healthcare act. You can fix Healthcare & student loans.Thanks
22 Million people without healthcare is not a way to control costs; it's a way to control population. #YouveLostYourMorals
Bull$hit
So nationalize healthcare already! Cheaper meds, reduce doctor costs, save all kinds of money!
Ron, you're a rich guy for rich guys. If you wealthy guys paid what you owe we'd not have a problem.
Medicade should be restricted even more. It is abused. Too many ER visits for trivial things. They should get the same level care as vets do
Medicaid can stand to be scaled tf down! Massive waste/fraud/abuse. Illegal aliens receiving benefits. #EnoughIsEnough
Patently false. Dumb & deplorable is no way to go through life, son.
I agree, son. You should work on that.
What economic evidence supports @GOP notion that tax cuts for billionaires increases health insurance coverage for low/middle income folk?

Ahh that's the slime-bag sell-out Senator I'm used to. Somebody gave you some BS talking points now you're ready to roll. 
Oh come on. Do you think we're all stupid?
Republican for "save" a program = slash it and give the savings to the rich in tax cuts.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
The CBO has a history of being notoriously wrong.
