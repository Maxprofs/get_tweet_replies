Kill aca
That's what they have tried to do by taking away risk funding - which gives excuse for ins cos to raise cost
Welcome to capitalism
The point is - Healthcare doesn't work in normal markets - look @ success in other countries - we pay too much
This isn't other countries
They are doing much better than us with healthcare - far less cost
Yeah, right you want to fix it! You won't even meet with your constituents! They are the ones you need to listen to! Kiss your career bye!
.@SenRonJohnson does not respond to tweets like this, but tweets like this make up much of his TL. He won't hold in-person townhall either
#If you're too afraid to hold in person townhalls you're doing your job wrong very wrong so wrong you should resign or be voted out
All democrats should be voted out.
Democrats are not afraid to hold in person townhalls
REPUBLICANS are afraid to answer questions from their constituents
Not working for ppl
Republicans are not terrorists. Democrats are the party of attempted murder of a congressman.
Thanks for proving my point herr Noah
Ok troll bot
Go back to the Nile in Egypt
Ron Johnson is totally unconcerned that ppl will die w/o affordable insurance.  He's rich.
Stop shoving health care down my throat
Stop shoving healthcare down your throat.  Say that when you are in a serious accident.
He doesn't work anyway. He would only have to pay a few dollars in fines for not hvg ins. He'll just go to the hospital for free care
#mooch
And your company pays for your insurance? 
#assclown
Great just what this bill needs...another rich, privileged white guy making healthcare decisions for women, poor, elderly and disabled.
There are more wealth Democrats in Congress than Republicans! What does that do to your liberal logic? SNAFUL
Please use common sense and choose people and country over party.  Please don't roll over with some bogus excuse.  Be better than that. Thx.
OPPOSE the Graham-Cassidy Bill or you will be a witness to mass murders of the elderly and disabled. Our very lives are in your hands.

A northern Wisconsin waitress will not be able to afford healthcare under #Trumpcare Vote NO!
You're a joke! You're so "involved in the process" that you lack the testicular fortitude to look your constituents in the eye? Do your job!
Is it just me or is his main page image depict a fairway?  Seems appropriate for someone who only serves the fat cat donors.
Repeal Obamacare.
Wisconsin must ask Ron Johnson how other countries are able to offer healthcare for all (and deliver higher quality than USA)!
Guess you won't meet with many of your constituents & listen to their needs. I guess the needs of insurance & pharm companies more important
Coward!!!
You ran to hurt children???
get Wisconsin the same deal Alaska has or vote no.   This process is corrupt

This is a terrible Bill and I would euthanize my cat before I let Walker plan her healthcare.

Americans want an independent investigation of #TrumpRussia. June 3rd we #MarchForTruth http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/nbc-wsj-poll-just-29-percent-approve-trump-s-firing-n759196 … 
Do not vote for this bill.  It is a death sentence for wi after walker got in there
You ran to help your riches constituents. Not a moment have you worked to help vulnerable ppl who voted for you. You should be ashamed.
When are you going to direct rescue & relief efforts to U.S. citizens of #PuertoRico? The situation is dire!
The dire straits many of Puerto Rico's elderly are in... 
Let's mandate you a minimum wage job w/out paid HC ins. Would you care then? Laws protect from price gowging ??? NOT 4 Rx & WealthCare. WHY?
The people of WI want #SinglePayerNow not a repeal that will leave many of us w/out ability to purchase #Healthcare LISTEN TO US
You are not improving health care insurance costs or coverage. Not balancing budget. Shame. Vote No.

Slower cuts to Medicaid are still cuts to Medicaid. Period. To fund a massive tax break for corporations & wealthy. We won't forget.

#Wisconsin thanks @SenatorBaldwin for standing up for our healthcare.  @SenRonJohnson, will you do the same?
#holdthefloor #notrumpcare 
OUTRAGEOUS 7 years to fix OC & U want to slow down process As a R U are an embarrassment
Republicans are pushing through a bill that doesn't work and gambling with American lives because they can't agree on a better plan.
Please vote no on Trumpcare. Cuts to Medicaid are unconscionable. We must protect kids, disabled, poor, elderly.  Do the right thing.
Actually, Johnson is ran to support his elite friends and really seems to hate the working man/women.

Is this also why you are trying to ram this through without hearing from all stakeholders. Clear you voice mail so we can report our protest
Liar. You want to satisfy your donors. Don't pretend to care about your constituents.
Please vote no on trumpcare. So many people are counting on you.
You ran so 11 million on medicaid are at risk?

In case you've been living under a rock: Trumpcare really sucks for cancer patients and their loved ones. https://twitter.com/CancerAdvocacy/status/885603036307107845 …

Fix #ACA not eliminate it!
I understand, to rip us off right?
This is so wrong.  The process of a few senators in a back room is unamerican.
WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING WHY USA IS THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY WITHOUT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND MAKING SURE THE 1%TERS GET RICHER? TRICKLE DOWN BS!
hmm sweeteners for some states to bribe yes vote, you should do press release saying you are voting no!
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN CONGRESS GETS THE SAME DEAL, THEN WE WILL SEE HOW GOOD THIS DEAL IS. NO EXEMPTION.
We are the wealthiest country on the planet, you should not support a bill that denies coverage to millions of Americans.
Tell it to the obstructionists in your own party--McCain, Paul, Collin et al.
We're not patients who need affordable care, such as Medicaid, we're an unsustainable fiscal path. Such compassion, senator
Agreed!!!

#StandUpForWisconsin
Vote No! No to $880Billion in Medicaid cuts!
Heard u on NPR defending/lying this  steaming turd of a bill that makes “death panels” look like a good time. How do you sleep at night?

You ran to take away medicaid from 1.75 Million veterans? #GrahamCassidy

I'm discovering you ran for the 1% only!  No to hurricane relief, no to DACA, no to #ACA, nothing said regarding violence in Charlottesville
#SAD!

Vote No, Ron. Don't kill and bankrupt millions of Americans!


Our #veterans, who answered the call to defend their nation, face a life or death battle to protect their health care from the #Republicans 
I just can't fathom your no vote on hurricane relief for the people suffering in Texas!  #Sad #Deplorable

CALL @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @robportman @JeffFlake 844-432-0883 & DEMAND #ProtectOurCare & keep #HandsOff #Medicaid. 
The healthcare bill cuts funding for women-MH and opiate protection! You said on the last tele TH you were against cutting bends to all!

If only your motivation was to help people versus corporations. Proposed plan is terrible. And why I won't vote to re-elect you.

Trump’s pick for the USDA’s chief scientist isn’t a scientist at all – he’s a homophobic radio host 
Sadly, SenJohnson, you are working against your most vulnerable constituents most of whom will lose their insurance under your GC Bill.

"This is why I ran. I wanted to kick 30 million Americans off their health insurance so I could erase a black man's name from history."
This bill is an attempt to appease GOP big-$$$ donors with no concern about the bill’s path to kill and bankrupt Americans. You are evil.

Under #GrahamCassidy, 414,000 people in Wisconsin will lose coverage, @SenRonJohnson #VoteNO!

Dear @SenRonJohnson: Do you care about your constituents? This person is speaking to you. ANSWER HER. #DoYourJob
I am his constituent and he has listened.  So get bent.
I am also his constituent. He does not listen, nor does he respond to email or phone calls. He is an embarrassment to this state.
He always does. I've been very critical sometimes, and he always thoughtfully replies.
Can you please have a town hall meeting 
We'd like to ask some questions on healthcare. 

Thank You 
SODD
Obamacare is fascism
Russian Bot.

The process is so secretive that even Republican senators are out of the loop on what's in the health care bill.

Koch Brothers promised $400 Million to the GOP but ONLY if they defeat #Obamacare & Pass Tax Reform. GOP are willing to kill citizens for $ 

NEW: How much will Trumpcare  premiums in your state? How many lose coverage? Cost to hospitals?

RT if helpful.

…
For once in your career, work for Wis, not for GOP. Do not vote for Trumpcare!
He's actually 1/3 that's voting AGAINST it! Can u believe it?
I know! Knock me over with a feather! I cannot believe it!
Do you think it's a ploy? (Am I paranoid? ) I called his office and thanked him- I am so shocked
You're not paranoid; I am skeptical of his motives - is he looking out for his constituents or does he think bill doesn't enuf ala Rand Paul
Admit ACA never was program put gov't between us &our Drs!Unregulated ins ALSO told us what Dr we could see.Drs decide ins they will take
Im a MD. We no longer have private practices- we can't afford the ins or overhead. WE don't pick wht ins we take. Our corps do.
In NE WI, every major med corp took the ACA. We were happy to take it. It makes our jobs easier to provide preventative medicine. Easier to
See all pts and treat them all the same. Fix the ACA. The new bill , the AHCA does not have us treat all pts equal. We will spend Half our
Time w pts trying to figure out what will be paid for in regards to their treatment. Vote NO. Protect pts in WI. Protect Doctors In Wi too.
Bi partisan fix to ACA is the right thing to do. NO to Graham-Cassidy
As you protested, you're being played. Vote no on MTP - don't allow this  travesty where no one knows what they'r voting for to continue
Fix the ACA. #VoteNo  on this repeal
#GrahamCassidy isn't fixing healthcare. Truth is tax cuts for rich is priority. But your healthcare is safe so what do YOU care, right?
Ron Is someone that should have not been reelected in the first place.
Cutting into their profits in your lobbyist money
We have 1,2,3 days stop bill from becoming law! Nows time to put max pressure on your Senators!
@SenRonJohnson By the way Maine's two senators, neither Democrats, are for Cassidy Graham-stop implying Maine is for it. It's called lying.
You are a hero for saying no to this healthcare bill and America owes you and your family .
Cease and desist letter...are you kidding me?
R u kidding me? Voting 4 this bill is like saying give $10k for this junk car and I promise I'll turn it into a new car!
so...you ran to take health care away from MILLIONS of your fellow americans while you enjoy full health care?!!! SAD...
Have you met Gov Ricketts of NE? He is not concerned about others healthcare. I do not have faith in him.
You should be ashamed putting your name on such a bill. "TAKE WHAT WE CAN GET" really you are that hard up to pass anything? Shame shame
You blamed John McCain's vote on his health instead of the GOP's bad process/bad bill?!!? I can't wait until John McCain gets a hold of you!
Move to another state...#Resign
No!  You are not listening to us.  The people  who depend on Medicaid.  States will not be fair and people will be homebound .
Think your obvious brain damage affected your votes?
Lol riiiiiight like you give a shit about people. More like losing those Koch donations.
Please vote against proceeding on current Trumpcare bill!
Any healthcare bill should include, congress must take the same plan they vote for America and no longer be covered by taxpayers of America!
I agree!


Whoa - that's a lot of , at least to us non-Senators...
Do you really have a forked tongue?

How much money from big insurance lines you pockets?
You voted for the wealth care bill.  No thanks.
You're a coward.
@SenJohnMcCain with a brain tumour is twice as intelligent and twice the man you are healthy #shameonyou #JohnMcCain
Please stand strong in opposing this healthcare bill
i don't believe your story about Sherry and Vern, first you say you they made too much money and then they had to sell their house????
Don't get to comfortable getting constituents arrested for trying to talk to you is not very smart.  Constituents vote!
Your arrogance during your TV interview this morning was proof of how disconnected you are from the American people....
do you have any decency? Your comments about Sen. McCain illustrate, you have no sense of decency.
78% of Americans want a Special Prosecutor!!! Why isn't the GOP listening???
. By the way. EXACTLY WHAT did YOU do to 'fix health care'. Vote to kill Americans & including some of your constituents? Shame.
Your idea on immigration leave it up to the states is the dumbest thing I've ever heard,time for new leaders in the senate

I don't mind change, but I do mind BAD insurance. If O care is not working, fix it! What you are attempting to do is wrong! I care premiums
Have a town hall Have a town hall Have a town hall Have a town hall Have a town hall Have a town hall Have a town hall Have a town hall!
What are the CBO numbers?  Oh wait we won't get to know before you try and push this bill through.  I bet they'll be bad.

In reference to #Senator #JohnMcCain please post your medical degree. #senatorRonJohnson #Wisconsin #HealthCare #Congress #GOP
When they needed another white man, I stood up.
Do you hate white people? They're like everywhere!
No, I love white people. They make all the best decisions.
I never really think much about anyone's race
I'm color blind.
We vote for trumo agenda not crony capitalism .ps we have out reach to Georgia ,Arizona ,South Carolina ,
The process of shoving a hastily crafted "healthcare" package written by insurance companies down the throats of your constituents? #SADVET
WEALTH CARE FOR JOHNSON SCREWED UP HEALTH CARE FOR US CHICKEN SHIT ASS HOLE JOHNSON
I hope you can see this health bill is not at all good for americans , and find yourself at the mercy of our health. Thank you

Can't wait until 2018 when we the ppl can vote you GOP POS OUT OF OFFICE 
Sir- I just heard you spew Bull Shit on MSNBC-  Learn the facts and quit lying- LEARN THE FACTS #GoldStarDad
EVIL! Such EVILNESS!
Repealing the ACA is not a fix. Country over party
Your comments about Senator McCain were out of line. Tell me if you would take the healthcare plan you proposed in exchange for govt plan.
What a #WIMP ! A real congressman would show up for a town hall. A real congressman like @russfeingold  Remember - we vote!! #PHONY
Americans want fixes to ACA not destroyed! 22 million people will lose Healthcare.We know bad bill.Back to ER for routine care. Voters care

so you'll be making sure u get the exact same health care you pawn off on everyone else? that's rich, speaking of, take out the rich tax cut
How do you sleep at night? This health bill is criminal.
You're a fraud. You'll vote for a crap bill if the House promises not to pass it. Koch bros must be paying you $$. Sold any soul you had.
I called Obamacare, "the greatest single assault on our freedom in our lifetime". On Donald Trump, "No comment."
The ACA represents the greatest threat of the profit line of insurance companies. Good? Bad? Depends on if you can afford to pay.
Repeal and replace Obamacare. You should all set aside your differences and learn also to compromise if need be.i don't ever think that per

Ron Johnson I don't believe you. You want to "fix" healthcare by fixing it so donors and business don't have to pay. Not for the people
And I say liberal cause your acting like a socialist l want it for free attitude I pay 11,000. A yr for 2 people so can u out of your salary
