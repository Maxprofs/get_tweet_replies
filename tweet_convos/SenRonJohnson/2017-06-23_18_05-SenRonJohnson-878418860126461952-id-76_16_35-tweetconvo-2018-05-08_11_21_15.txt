No medicaid cuts!
No answer, voicemail full, every time I have ever called. When's the town hall? Like you said, constituent feedback is essential.
Lifetime caps bankrupted my family. 
Three times. 
Anyone that votes for this, and refuses to fix the ACA, is a godless money-worshipper.
You're absolute filth, Johnson. Killing people for a tax cut is very 'Christian' of you.
U Democrat RON! We will vote you OUT help us @POTUS call him out!!!
Ron Johnson went on @MeetThePress yesterday& told the world he wants to kill me http://cognidissidence.blogspot.com/2017/06/now-ron-johnson-wants-to-kill-me.html … @wisdems @wisgop #tcot #wiunion
I am appreciating your common sense on this.
Johnson can't be trusted to tell truth. He says he's undecided but always votes in lockstep w/party & Trump. Playing a game. What a crock!
It's a tax cut for the wealthy and it effectively kills Medicaid. It will result in millions losing coverage. Not hard to understand.
Please propose an amendment making Congress subject to TrumpCare.
No Medicaid Cuts!
Quit going on CNN
Don't be that guy @SenRonJohnson  do what you were voted on to do!!
RJ,I live in Wisconsin. If you vote yes on AHCA I will remind our neighbors that you were in favor of destroying millions of American lives.
Every parent who watches their child suffer because you wanted to kick back to donors will be reminded you are personally responsible.
And it is personal.  This isn't some shitty talking point or political vendetta, this is our ability to live and work and care for families.
If you vote in favor of this you better be packed and ready to move to fucking Illinois because you won't be welcome here.
How will u justify cutting Medicaid? Kids, low income, disabled, elderly desperately NEED this!!! Ppl will die if u vote for this!!!
Make it right!
Trying 2 complicate the obvious doesn't change the simple fact that what's good for USA is people's healthcare, not increasing wealth gap
Yeah, the base may fall for that. The other 65% of us know better.
No one had their coverage "halved"--Essential benefits part of ACA prevents.that,The free market is an immoral way t2 deliver healthcare
Health coverage that fits our needs is FULL COVERAGE,no rising premiums or drugs costs & no fools STEALING OUR COVERAGE 4 tax breaks 4 rich!
Sequester congress until they fix the healthcare problem.  Can't bare to watch them drop obstruction bombs then go on vacation. Work it out!
Lead by example Mr.Johnson, do not accept this bill in any form. We elected you to help us!
Please vote no, my family needs protection!
Vote NO
Why Won't you just get it right? And TRY not to Lie!!!
No need for rhetoric then...
you deserve any and all pre-existing conditions for what you are abt to do to the American people
Johnson will vote with his party. For him it's party over country even if Americans die. And they will die if this bill is passed. No doubt.
Bullshit
Your constituents are counting on you, vote no now and later. This travesty is not a health plan.
Vote No.  No lifetime caps.  Thank you.
Constituent here the coverage for PECs MUST stay. Many are genetic or are you now advocating abortion

The cuts to Medicaid will hurt my disabled child. We are a WI family. Vote NO on this terrible bill!
This bill will hurt so many poor, elderly and disabled people. Vote no.

Going through this disaster of a 'health care' plan now. https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SENATEHEALTHCARE.pdf …
It's not a "health plan", it's a tax cut for the wealthy, raises premiums, and cuts services.
I stand with Ron Johnson. Too many people hurt by this bill. My party better get it right or my vote goes elsewhere.
I've read the bill and am wondering how the text of the actual bill is rhetoric.
