@SenRonJohnson "poster-child of Washington incompetence and a leadership failure" -- WOW!  I thought that was your job?!
@SenRonJohnson --Impeach Obama-- Hillary is a liar and a actress just like her boss. PLEASE save Our Nation--Put it all  on on the line!
@SenRonJohnson everything u ppl do is a failureofleadership&incompetence,  instead u rule by greed&extorted by ur $ donors #tgdn #tcot
@SenRonJohnson Unfortunately, many of your Republican colleagues forgot to take their testicles with them to the Hillary Clinton hearing.
Thank you, @SenRonJohnson! http://tinyurl.com/ah9zv8e  You've only made Sec'y Clinton look more presidential, and yourself more the buffoon. #tcot
@SenRonJohnson Thank you Senator Johnson.You were one of only 3 people that asked a pertinent #Benghazi question in the hearing #PJNET #TGDN
@eagle17765 That may be but at least he asked a question yesterday. There weren't many that did@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson  So what are you going to do about it?
@SenRonJohnson SURI, Note 2 RJ, 9/11 is the poster child of leadership on a grand scale.  If U can't see that, U should step down.
@SenRonJohnson Both Rs & Ds responsible for #Bengazi. We shouldn't be in Libya in the first damn place.
Washington has its share of incompetence the President far exceeds that @SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson QUESTION: You are a senator in where? Oh right, Washington. Way to bad mouth yourself. #Youarethebadleader
@SenRonJohnson When did we decide quibbling was not lying? Hillary's quibbling & theatrics during the hearing set a new low.
@SenRonJohnson NO, Mr. Johnson, YOU ARE! How disrespectful. You don't have 1/2 the intelligence of Secretary Clinton.
@SenRonJohnson Bullshit, invading Iraq was waaaaaay worse.
@SenRonJohnson question is what are they hiding? Possibly gun running to Syrian Rebels?? Four Americans dead and we have NO answers!
@SenRonJohnson Where are the survivors? Maybe they will tell the truth @hrclinton can not! @SenJohnThune @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio #tcot
TAXPAYERS/CITIZENS'll soon MAKE our Case for IMPEACHING Obama to US Representatives in each State @SenRonJohnson #TGDN #tcot #ProImPeachment
.@SenRonJohnson #Benghazi (before, during, after) also proves that #Hillary isn't qualified to go any further. #tcot http://twitpic.com/by0j3t 
@SenRonJohnson  No sir.... #Benghazi was NOT incompetence... it was a deliberate act to protect Obama's campaign.... PERIOD! #tcot @GOP
@SenRonJohnson We had our chance to fix stupid and incompetence Nov 6th and failed.  Impeach them then!
@SenRonJohnson @paulorigin Their Needs to be consequences for this #failure of duty and it needs to be message sending. Load and clear
@puchead77 @SenRonJohnson Don't keep your breath, not with those usurpers! #teaparty #tgdn #NRA #tcot #Ccot
@SenRonJohnson If Obama/Clinton had killed 100,000 American's it would not matter to the idiots who support him.(here comes santa clauss)
@SenRonJohnson  Appropriate Statement Sir-A favorite timely saying of mine is-"When someone shows you who they are-believe them". She did!
@SenRonJohnson I too, am utterly appalled at the way Dems and their handmaidens, the liberal press have behaved in this matter. Pathetic.
@SenRonJohnson No, the Iraq war was. Any word on where those WMD"s might be?..you need to redefine "grand scale." How many dead so far?
@SenRonJohnson -your assessment about Benghazi issues good start-have to find ways to make difference we can't just talk about it-be strong
Then  you should feel comfortable there judging from your hearing(s) performance @SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson - sounds like you are describing congress
@SenRonJohnson Agreed! Sen &Con had 5 hours with Hil to ask the tough questions and chose to make it a going away love fest. Shameful!
@SenRonJohnson keep up this rhetoric, I'm loving it as it dooms the GOP to the irrelevant, out of touch, back to the 50s party it has become
.@SenRonJohnson It's a poster-child 4 gun running 2 MusBro to arm anti-Assad forces for benefit of Qatar getting control of Syrian pipelines
@SenRonJohnson No, that poster child is YOU. Really, you didn't even bother to attend the briefing? Yours is failure on an epic scale.
@SenRonJohnson - Benghazi-style attacks happened many times during the previous admin. You & your pathetic party cared never. Not once.
@SenRonJohnson No, incompetence is a senator not doing his job like urself sir! Please explain why u missed briefing where facts were shown.
@SenRonJohnson you are pathetic
@SenRonJohnson u r right& ur part of the problem.Instead of funding additional security u tried to become significant with ur question.Dumb!
@SenRonJohnson It's also the poster child of a government that protects its own at the expense of the people it is supposed to work for.
.@SenRonJohnson is the poster-child of Washington incompetence. Just like idiots McCain & Grahamn he never attended the Benghazi briefing...
@SenRonJohnson Same through history of every attack on the US  How about the original 9-11 We should have fired Bush two wars trillions owed
@SenRonJohnson You really need to stop making an idiot of yourself. http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/24/16681342-ron-johnson-still-struggling …
@SenRonJohnson YOU are a poster-child for Washington incompetence and leadership failure. You have no business in office. STFU.
@SenRonJohnson No, you proved you and your GOP colleagues are the poster-child of Washington incompetence and leadership failure.
Senator, you are the poster-child for hubris predicated on ignorance & are an embarrassment to Wisconsin & the nation #ctl @SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson The Republicans are the poster-children of Washington incompetence and a leadership failure on a grand scale.
@SenRonJohnson You are the poster child for Wisconsin incompetence along w/ @ScottKWalker #SeanDuffy and #Grothman
@SenRonJohnson If that's your assessment, then you're the poster-child of what happens when you swill Fox News and Drudge nonsense. #fail
@SenRonJohnson 
As the Senator from my City you are a total embarrassment to our State. Watched Clinton & Kerry live you r disgraceful!
@SenRonJohnson If you're so concerned about Benghazi, why didn't you avail yourself of the classified info that was made available to you?
.@SenRonJohnson 2 former Senators made you look like a complete idiot in 2 days. LOL Keep up the good work Senator.
@SenRonJohnson we have the Weakest GOP leadership I have seen in my entire life. No GOP person willing to give it all? Too political no guts
.@SenRonJohnson Prosecute those involved for criminal negligence leading to death in #Benghazi. Pull the thread and watch the web unravel.
@SenRonJohnson So Senator...what is Congress gonna do about it? Or does that not make a difference either?
.@SenRonJohnson : Benghazi is the poster child of GOP political grandstanding by incompetent and ignorant congressmen.
@SenRonJohnson #RedNationRising #BenghaziTerrorMurderCoverUp 
When will we see the survivors testify?
@SenRonJohnson 
#BenghaziTerrorMurderCoverUp 
#RedNationRising 
Shame on Republicans for letting Clinton off the hook.
@SenRonJohnson Did you ask the question: Who gave the order to stand down? And why not? Or did Repubs agree in advance not to? #Benghazi
@Johnny_Petrini @SenRonJohnson I'd like to know the answer to that. And why did O&SoS stand in front of dead's caskets and blame the video?
@foxnme @senronjohnson 
The American people # the families of the fallen have a right to know: WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO STAND DOWN? #Benghazi
@Johnny_Petrini @SenRonJohnson Thanks for the RT Johnny. Why is it the more we say we want truth, the more we are ignored and Hil walks away
@SenRonJohnson You want a "poster-child of WA incompetence"? Let's go chat w/ Marathon Man. Or, you could just look in a mirror. #SHAME
@SenRonJohnson @HeidiL_RN 

So what is Congress going to do about it other than say - "Yup, sure is a mess". 

Remember Nixon lost his job.
@SenRonJohnson If this doesn't show that Hillary is not competent enuf to B R next pres, what does?
@SenRonJohnson - where was your party’s indignation at failure of our leadership to protect our citizens on 9/11?
#hypocrite #partisanhack
@SenRonJohnson You too, are a poster child for incompetence.  what an embarrassment for the state of wisconsin.  that's the TRUTH!
@SenRonJohnson Promoting factual information and educating the public is the best way to ensure responsible government.  #Benghazi #budget
@SenRonJohnson-Who pushed the video should've been the theme. Ben Shapiro,Rush,Hannity, would've been better interrogaters than you schmos
@SenRonJohnson No sir, you are the poster child for Washington incompetence and are represent what is wrong with today's Rs
@SenRonJohnson-incompetent cross examination from the GOP.
@SenRonJohnson You seemed very petty and petulant yesterday. Will remember in 2016.
@SenRonJohnson-what's worse than you letting up on her, after her contradictory answer, was you were the best the GOP had for her
@SenRonJohnson You are vile and playing for the #TeaParty #TCOT and made a fool of yourself trying to get national attention, #EpicFAIL.
@SenRonJohnson Actually, YOU would be that poster child. Your bit to Buzzfeed was disgusting. Idiocy on nat'l stage never bodes well.#growup
.@MorningMika .@SenRonJohnson You are a complete embarrassment to the state of Wisconsin. You are incompetent. Beghazi is #GOP money-grab.
@SenRonJohnson  not one of you asked the hard questions.  Bunch of grandstanding.  Pathetic.  Who gave the order to stand down?
@SenRonJohnson Really? You're still talking after getting your ass handed to you today? #goaway #GOPfail #hillary2016
@SenRonJohnson You sir, R a Malpractice case #200K4NOTHING Get a JOB  Recall time #Wisconsin #USA #World #NEWS

@SenRonJohnson Obama and Hillary still lying about Benghazi GunRunning Coverup! by Max Emfinger http://wp.me/p2fDtb-Nw  @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz
@SenRonJohnson You need a professiona PR firm to get your name to the national stage I appreciate what you did today, showing some backbone!
@SenRonJohnson someone should have grown a pair and put H. Clinton in her place. Instead, she walks all over yall. Nice job.
@SenRonJohnson @senronjohnson @DivineMoments   "Don't mistake cunning for incompetence -- Big Difference!  Gee, lotta missles now in Syria
@SenRonJohnson It is a shame to sent too many politicians and less Indians to provide better security. Gov. wasting money and wrong contract
@SenRonJohnson It does not take a genius to look at the security measurements on Embassies.  Better engineering on placement
@SenRonJohnson The other problem State Dept always hiring GS12 and above wasting funds with incompetent personnel.  Lower rank are realistic
@SenRonJohnson Ignore the looney liberals on ur timeline. U & 2other Repub Senators were only ones to really ask probing questions! HRC lied
@SenRonJohnson Senator, is obvious about the incident.  This has been an ongoing mishap from State Dept.  Security with the wrong contract.
@SenRonJohnson Hey Ron, does your asshole still hurt? That was some savage reaming Madam Secretary gave ya! #Served
@SenRonJohnson thank you Senator
@SenRonJohnson Actually your questioning is a perfect example of why GOP is tanking. Irrelevant, angry.
@SenRonJohnson and what are you going to do to make it better?
@SenRonJohnson dude, you are so in over your head. An embarrassment to Wisconsin.
@SenRonJohnson i wish that you would quit politicizing the attack and find out who did it so that they may be brought to justice.
@SenRonJohnson Your questions and observations were right on, but I was disappointed that more questions were not substantive.  Why??
@SenRonJohnson - With all due respect sir, when will the people responsible for this treasoness inaction be arrested, tried and charged?
@SenRonJohnson You mean like the Lie and incompetence that sent thousands to war over an incompetent report of weapons of mass destruction?
@SenRonJohnson 
Are you having an elder moment? *shakes your hand and walks away.
@SenRonJohnson Like your job? Don't get used to it?
@SenRonJohnson I appreciated your hard questions even though Hilary made a mockery of both Committees.. Is #Benghazi over now??
@SenRonJohnson that's what happens when you have an administration in the @Whitehouse that would rather be socialites party with JZ,Beyonce
@SenRonJohnson will we ever get a resolution for the 4 dead Americans. It sure didnt sound like it today!
@SenRonJohnson YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE. WHAT MORONS VOTED FOR YOU?  SAD STATE OF THIS COUNTRY.
.@SenRonJohnson  Thank You for "Pushing" S.O.S Clinton for a reply....
"What difference, at this point, does it make?" #TGDN #BENGHAZI
@SenRonJohnson What event caused more casualties ? 9/11 or Benghazi ? There are evil people out here who will stop at nothing to do us harm.
@SenRonJohnson 4 Die in Benghazi & We're Having Cong. Hearings. 26 Die in Newtown, CT & 1,000+ Since, & We Can't Even Talk About it.  #tcot
@SenRonJohnson yawn! When are the hearings on the weapons of MADD destruction in Iraq? And the 52 who died in embassies under Bush!!!
@SenRonJohnson You sir, and the Republican party are the poster children of incompetence and leadership failure. Jobs, Budget, Defense!
@SenRonJohnson BTW enjoy your remaining time as Senator;-)  WE THE PEOPLE R TIRED of do nothing GOP congress! I agree w/ @Time2Standup80
@SenRonJohnson U need to find another axe to grind. U made urself look real foolish and small today with ur line of questioning
@SenRonJohnson R U crazy? U & the GOP congress R the most incompetent congress of all time & we're tired of being held hostage! #Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson I don't recall any  hearings on the other multiple Embassy attacks resulting  in hundreds of American diplomats lives lost
@SenRonJohnson And Iraq? 4,000 young Americans dead because an entire war is launched on false pretenses. You have no sense of perspective.
@SenRonJohnson You did a great job at the hearing, Sen. Johnson! Keep up the good work! We'll be praying for you all!
@SenRonJohnson Hey!!!...Nice grandstanding and blowhardery today Nnnnnnumbnutz! YOU GUYS ARE CLOWNS!!! #JackassGOP

@SenRonJohnson Since there are still so many unanswered questions, what happens next?
@SenRonJohnson I have been seeing quite a few tweets that say the same thing about you. I am one of your constituents and am hanging my head
@SenRonJohnson When are the hearings for the 20 children killed on our soil in Newtown? #Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson 

The articles of Impeachment need to be reviewed.  

Main question: 
Who ordered the stand down ?
No, @SenRonJohnson, Bengazi is an example that the world can be a violent, dangerous place. *You* are poster for leadership failure.
@SenRonJohnson If it were only imcompetence.  The questions surrounding these deaths brings to mind something intentional and evil.
@SenRonJohnson how would you define 9/11? Katrina Response? It's Always Tragic When One of America's Finest Gives All! Drop the Politics!
@SenRonJohnson Why did Congress cut funding for Embassy Security, causing Benghazi? #GOPfail #ManUp
@SenRonJohnson Clinton gets off scott-free... What a terrible injustice
@matthewloop Travesty, but watch this to see what may be even worse. http://youtu.be/AmwNrNaTcs4  @SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson You were royally dressed down by the Secretary, well deserved.  You think this is a game!
@SenRonJohnson  You are the poster child for someone who never should have been elected to Congress. #embarrassing
Well @SenRonJohnson, I truly believe no one could have de facto prevented that terrible tragedy... regardless what party affiliation
@SenRonJohnson Another waste of time by Congress. Recommendations received and accepted by Clinton. Work on removing corporate tx loopholes!
@SenRonJohnson Thank you for your thoughtful & serious questions. Shame on those that ignored intent of hearing --unAmerican
@SenRonJohnson Where are the survivors from #Benghazi ~ has anybody spoken to them?
@SenRonJohnson clinton said weapons they sent to syria was found in algeria used by al qaeda? these was used to kill more americans!!
@SenRonJohnson dig deeper the TRUTH NEEDS TO BE TOLD.
@SenRonJohnson Do some real work, for goodness sake. What a ridiculous comment.
@SenRonJohnson and I'm sure u would have done a better job.politicians Mae me laugh. #posturing
.@SenRonJohnson you're an idiot. #Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson 9/11
@SenRonJohnson Last thing you give a shit about is people killed in Benghazi & the reason you should be thrown out of office #tcot #p1
@SenRonJohnson so more so than 9/11, Afghanistan, Katrina, and every other grand scale failure that happened on Bush's watch? Got it.
@SenRonJohnson Providing weaponry and ground transport (via Libya) to "Extortioner's" of Algeria might be #2 "leadership failure",eh?
@SenRonJohnson show some respect junior senator love watching you get schooled by a woman #tcot #tp
@SenRonJohnson Oh man, you looked like the back bencher you are....I'm ashamed to be from Wisconsin. #clownbadger
@SenRonJohnson actually - you are.
@SenRonJohnson Then do something about it
@SenRonJohnson I don't think your parents would be proud of your rudeness today. It was really disgusting.
@SenRonJohnson You are the poster child for Wisconsin incompetence. #GovWalker #Duffy. Well, maybe #Grothman is a bit more of a buffoon...
@SenRonJohnson You came across as a bully interested in taking political potshots. You took em-they didn't work.made u look mean and small.
@SenRonJohnson Yes, Washington is incompetent bt let's begin wit ur committee, your thoughts,  and attempted way to raise your profile 2 day
@SenRonJohnson no the way u attack Clinton today is a direct result of why republicans will lose races in 14 & 16. You were out of order.
@SenRonJohnson You guys let her off today and most Americans are not Happy:-(
@SenRonJohnson Good job,today Senator. Don't let the liars & crooks off the hook.America needs your courage.
@SenRonJohnson Senator u were right on.
@SenRonJohnson an athlete who lies is somehow a bigger deal than a politician who lies, the truth doesn't matter anymore? Typical Clinton!
@SenRonJohnson So Benghazi is to Presidential #fail as #NDAA is to Congressional #fail?
@SenRonJohnson    If you're making the progressive libs mad, you know you're doing your job!
@SenRonJohnson Absolutely!! Subpoena them all and don't let them lie anymore!!
@SenRonJohnson you're actually describing the Iraq war! I can't believe #Taxpayers pay for such gross waste like your salary #TEABAGGER
@senronjohnson I appreciate you asking the tough questions during that hearing.
@SenRonJohnson Oh and what did you think of the Bush Administration after 911?  You embarrassed yourself big time today.
@SenRonJohnson Try doing something positive with your time in Washington instead of going on a witch hunt. Fight for gun control, jobs, etc.
@SenRonJohnson Baloney! Your behavior was shameful. Stop trying to create a controversy where it doesn't belong. Your out of your league.
@SenRonJohnson Thank you Sen. Johnson for being one of the few who actually asked questions that many American people want to know#Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson And you lead the choir when it comes to incompetence! Leadership, you wouldn't recognize it, it it bit you!
@SenRonJohnson you looked like you are part of the leadership that is a problem, on a grand scale, Hillary made you look incompetent.
@SenRonJohnson I doubt you could do ANY better, Senator. You don't strike me as a ground-shaker yourself.
@SenRonJohnson U guys R incredibly ignorant.Ur Buffoonery is gettin a lil tired,
Why dont u shut the fuck up n let adults govern #CTL #Truth
@SenRonJohnson You're just mad because Secretary Clinton kicked your ass #whiner
@SenRonJohnson I'm sorry Sen you are a disgrace to us in WI.  Grow up and act like a human person.  Disagree but be professional
@SenRonJohnson Thank you for telling the truth
@SenRonJohnson 
I feel you all had the chance to
Really get to the bottom of Beghzai 
And you all blew it!!
@SenRonJohnson you're just another tea party idiot- get a new act!
@SenRonJohnson good Job today.  But still too many unanswered questions.   We need another hearing.
.@SenRonJohnson & you r the poster child of a disrespectful egotistical dying breed Trying 2 gin up controversy where there isn't
#Benghazi
@SenRonJohnson youre question maked me think the problem is with #Republicans, @GOP love the witch hunts but hate the facts! Youre a MORON!
@SenRonJohnson If  truth ever came out, would likely rise to the level of being an impeachable offense. MSM will help BHO ensure  it doesn;t
@SenRonJohnson  Sucks to be fillibustered, huh? Maybe if you weren't so focused on making this political, you'd get somewhere, hmm?
@SenRonJohnson Us whose watched #Benghazi unfold as it hapnd n REALTIME knows this is true!  Gamer VILE RAT!  http://Mattiani.com  #TGDN
@SenRonJohnson With all due respect..being none...you are an idiot.
@SenRonJohnson HC scores 2, Congress 0
@SenRonJohnson Political correctness and islam are the issues that need to be addressed. Radical islam must be destroyed.
@SenRonJohnson 
Good job senator, we need more like you!
@SenRonJohnson you should have had video of Clinton in front of those flag draped coffins blaming the video
@SenRonJohnson @reppaulryan the "during" part of the #Benghazi attacks is the most troubling, our guy left behind to die! #IMPEACHMENT
@SenRonJohnson - can someone just ask who gave the "Stand Down" order while watching terrorists attack for 7 hours via live video?  Who?
.@SenRonJohnson Based on the tone of your questioning today, incompetence is a subject you know a lot about.
@SenRonJohnson can u please get with the House leaders n start BHOs #IMPEACHMENT! Watergate was a joke compared to #Benghazi!
