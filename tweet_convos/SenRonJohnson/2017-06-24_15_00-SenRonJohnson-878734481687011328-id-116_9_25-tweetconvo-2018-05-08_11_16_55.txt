Wisconsin prosperity can't afford AHCA! Please vote NO.
LIAR!
We all have Google, who do you think you're fooling?  http://nashp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NASHP-Premium-Differences-ACA-v-AHCA-WI-2017.06.081.pdf …
Look up Google all you want but we know what Obamacare brought us and you have no idea what OPTIONAL Trumpcare would bring.
That's projection. Perhaps you have no idea? Doctors, economists, patients, families and rural areas where healthcare employs many do know.
Here, try this:
On @MSNBC: I explain how massive $1T health coverage cuts will harm millions and damage our entire health system http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-news/watch/the-unaffordable-healthcare-act-975646275807 …
Hey Ron, pre-existing conditions. Here's a fact, Diabetes. Many causes. Mine came from a virus that impacted by pancreas. Now a pre-existing
1) In the UK, on the NHS (you might need to look up what other western countries do to protect the health of their citizens) I actually get
2) free prescriptions and heathcare due to my condition. This means I get to stay relatively healthy and contribute to society
So, by making sure I have cover, I pay substantial taxes because I can earn money and pay them. ACHA? I would be screwed over.
It's what caring societies do. Kind of what Obamacare wanted to do but the GOP wanted to make sure the rich got richer. Priorities I guess
Maybe instead of repealing ACA, you should concentrate on reducing the massive costs of drugs and services there. THAT would reduce premiums
Imploring you again to vote no on healthcare bill. Lifetime caps will be devastating.
VOTE NO ON AHCA
Hmm...Doesn't look like it went well. You're a monster.

Senator Johnson, People with pre-existing conditions are not cars that have already been wrecked. SMH!
Watched. People w/ pre-existing conditions are not wrecked cars. Private debt is just as crushing as public debt. ACA reduces med bkrptcy.
I'll take the healthcare you receive. Thank you.
Wow Senator, people are not pleased with you... Vote no!
Ron Jon, come on bro.  Are u working for WI or not? The current GOP "healthcare" bill is a bad deal for WI. We're getting screwed. WI First!
Will you brag about how your party dragged out people in wheelchairs & had them handcuffed and arrested? You must be so proud
What you said about pre-existing conditions was reprehensible. You are supposed to be FOR Americans, not against them. You are horrible.
Agreed much more debate needed on #AHCA. There's no reason to rush for a vote on something so heinous! #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoCutsNoCaps
Senator, with all due respect, you are despicable.
AMEN
https://twitter.com/politicangst/status/879235010036867072 …
Wow. @SenRonJohnson really doesn't want to be re-election.

I tuned in and wasn't surprised , please work for The People , we shouldn't be punished for being poor
I just saw you on Meet The Press, and Sen Johnson, learn MMT, and learn how our Economy actually is.Debt will not be handed down to GrandBy
Want honesty Senator? This bill cuts healthcare/medicaid to give tax cuts to 1%ers & ins co. Period. #VoteNo
"I don't have the info from constituencies to vote on the bill," says the Senator who refuses to answer calls or hold a Town Hall. #Coward
Caught you on #MeetThePress. So much talk about what WI constituents think about #Wealthcare bill. When do you intend to meet with us?
Please, please vote "no" to trumpcare. It will be devastating to poor and working class. Pleas read this:
And what a disaster you were! Couldn't even defend what is good in the HCare Bill! Will never pass with you weak senators! 
To fix Obamacare, make insurance companies take on the pre-existing conditions and STOP multi million dollar bonuses for their executives
@senRonJohnson: People with preexisting condition don’t deserve insurance like ‘somebody who crashes their car’ http://www.rawstory.com/2017/06/ron-johnson-people-with-preexisting-condition-dont-deserve-insurance-like-somebody-who-crashes-their-car/#.WU_3zUlLPq8.twitter … @GOP
Sounds like Ron doesn't deserve his job like someone who would shoot someone on 5th avenue
We tuned in.

We were not pleased.
Gobbledygook goop. Pass it and move on!! #GOVERN!
Do you really think that about pre-existing conditions? You should pay more if they have say, a heart attack? Assuming you have a heart.
#realnews This is America. DO YOUR JOB. Represent us! Be our voice! We need equal healthcare. This is not a partisan issue. #WeThePeople
Vote no on health bill. Or commit genocide on the American people. Your choice will be recorded in history.
Name 5 benefits for your constituents under this bill that will be better than what they have now.
Vote NO listen to America!
Let's be realistic...you are not interested in fixing anything. You'll fall in line along with all the other Republicans.
Wait, did you day the mandate drove up premiums?
Thanks for putting the brakes on.
Senator Johnson: Thank you for not supporting the current H/C Bill that separates healthcare for 20 million Americans. ISIS wants USA to die
You are evil incarnate. There isn't a hell cruel enough or hot enough for human  like you.
Tuned in... how do you feel about lying to your Country? Pre-Existing conditions are not car accidents. People are not cars. #SaveTheACA
GOP cares way more about cars than people

Ron Johnson: People with preexisting condition don’t deserve insurance like ‘somebody who crashes their car’ http://ow.ly/5p9930cSh4u  

I'm on meds for BP (a pre-existing condition) Should I just die, so you can give more money back to the rich?
You actually equated pre existing conditions to car crashes! What a dope. Maybe you should step down from the senate.
Thank you for you comments on health care. Please stall the vote until there's a more workable plan. Vote no.
He lied his ass off even when faced with this own words (video  lies). He is poison to the poor, sick and old, poor includes babies.  Killer
I hope you don't vote for this catastrophic bill. You've had 4 yrs to try & fix the ACA.
News flash, you soulless vampire. People aren't cars.
Great. When will you meet with your constituents? 

You've held as exactly as many town halls in WI this year as I have.
Fire him
AARP going to kick your ass if you vote for AHCA.
If you get a second chance act like a man. Todd steamrolled you.
You should never represent republicans in the media - you got steamrolled by socialist Todd.
Chuck smirked and made you look foolish. You need to support Trump and stick it in Todds eye but you have no balls.
Now if all those pesky people with disabilities, elderly in nursing homes,poor women having babies & poor kids would just disappear.
Well Ron Johnson looks like one malignant pre-existing condition and shouldn't have insurance at all
Lying POS
when will you have a townhall or hearing in the healthcare bill? All behind closed doors.
so according to the Senator, because I'm a cancer survivor my cancer premiums should be double?
Tuned in.. Waste of time. Want to plead for RJ to say no. Is it  blowing smoke in the wind? SHAME ( if it's yes).
Watched you. I truly hope you can help delay this vote. We need a well thought out bill not a rush from repubs. If it goes, please vote no
Stupid lying RINO! You promised to "REPEAL" Obamacare and now you're backing out. You're DONE!!!
You should be in a high risk pool for stupidity, moral bankruptcy, and greed!
Chuck Todd called you out for the #Fraud you really are. #RepealObamaCare
I stand with you, Cruz, Rand, Lee and Heller against Swampcare. Ask for a real repeal.

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
You better include the 3 phases of reforming healthcare and not present this recon bill like the full "answer." Lots of cost cutting to come
Please vote no on AHCA, which will harm the healthcare and economy of all Wisconsinites.
Excellent graphic via @js_politics. Thanks, @clairmc 

Rural Wisconsinites get hit again, like in funding for roads and schools. @chucktodd
2 Qs: What objective criteria must be met for you to vote for Senate health bill? Why screen your "townhall" sessions?
The GOP has had a long-standing reputation of being organized, professional ad
resourceful. Well, it is now the lowest common denominator!
It is easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to
enter the Kingdom of Heaven. M 19:24, M10:25, L18:25
It looks like the Republicans are creating a hybrid of capitalism & communism; I guess that is why their election symbol is "Red"!
Do the Democrats have a right to sing the Blues?  Oh Baby!
The “rugged individualist” myth results in a few billionaires accumulating wealth & power controlling the US's political system & economy.
Doesn't account for Clinton cartel, Entertainment news complex, Silicon Valley barons or George Soros --how's that for political clout?
Contractors that financed GOP campaigns want and other regional war for profit & Korea is one of the possibilities, lives & billions lost!
Trump's inconsistent temperament & policy tweets/rants & many investigations by 2018 the "Donald" will probably resign. Is this by design?
The 1% & GOP $ supporters need more tax cuts than they already have had since 39 because the US is a welfare state for those Americans!
Violent mentally ill person(s) access to weapons fueled by Internet extremism, economic hardship & GOP/NRA laws, violence is always wrong!
without Left wing street mobs, anti-free speech college students and Hollywood notables who accept and promote violence, we'd be safer.
You told @politico you want people to choose the health plan they WANT. Don't you think, given the choice, they'd choose YOUR health plan?
You know, the one you Senators and Congress get which covers all the things we couldn't afford BEFORE ObamaCare? Wisconsin native asking.
I request of you to be a GOP team player not a dem.  You will be on news reel.  B advocate not Devisise
Who are you?

150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …
