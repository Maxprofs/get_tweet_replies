.@SenRonJohnson @CNN @wolfblitzer Senator, you are an embarrassment. Law abiding citizens don't need AR-15's.
@Pie_SocialMedia @SenRonJohnson @CNN @wolfblitzer Idiot...idiot!  Along with @govscottwalker
You suck the @NRA's dick like I've never seen anybody suck dick before. It's embarrassing.
Their blood is on your hands. You protect a terrorist's right to buy a gun but not the lives of Americans.
I think it's time to ban you from speaking
I've been thinking that for years!
Evidently @SenRonJohnson thinks 49 people died and 53 are hospitalized from spontaneous lead poisoning.
@bluedillygal @CNN @wolfblitzer @SenRonJohnson Wait! What?

Ron Johnson, Champion of Mass Murder.
You are the worst Senator!  You still defended the assault weapon as a constitutional right?!?! #shameless
If it was one if your kids or family killed you would be spinning different garbage Senator
I doubt he would. Money over all. He sux.
Maybe it's time to ban weapons, and quit taking the @NRA's $$.
because that would stop the animals from killing us with knives or bombs You can be a victim
Cops were there w guns & couldn't stop him b4 slaughter idiot HIS AR15 DID
How about not letting an aninal that the FBI investigated get guns? You dumb ass
GOP NRA stop FBI fr doing their job blocking ppl like him u blame wrong ppl
The NRA didnt let hin get guns, the failure of our soft govt did!
This isn't just political correctness in DC , it's tyranny ! Impeach Obama , Hillary , and his Admin.
this is why term limits are needed for congress. Too much money, so few ideas
A lot of lawmakers are in the #NRA's pocket, but this is some all-time "Yes, Master" shamelessness, sir.
will y'all be discussing the 1.3 million dollar payout he got from gun lobbyists or nah?
we need background checks and there is no reason for assault rifles
Did you mention your vote to make it EASIER for suspected terrorists to get guns/explosives? http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00319 …
Senator, tell me why anyone needs an assault rifle.
AR 15 has nada to do with hunting or protection.It is a weapon to KILL.Blood on your hands Sen. Money/life?
you have a brain the size of a pea senator #gunreform
@SenRonJohnson @CNN @wolfblitzer
Shame on you!
you are a total embarrassment! Wisconsinite's shame for allowing this shit-for-brains to represent them.
Great.  Will you discuss the $1.3Million you have accepted from the gun lobby?
OMG the grafts you take from NRA shows how laws are put together
Johnson is a moron
Enjoy Hell, senator, because Satan is keeping your seat warm.
Shame.
Shame on you. We need to not only ban these weapons but payouts from private interests to ppl like YOU.
It's time to ditch the NRA talking points and get real about doing something.  Stop taking NRA blood money.
Our Founding Fathers are turning in their graves listening to this NRA paid for moron! Shame on you sir.
that was a DISGRACE.. the Senator on assault rifles being used: "SO WHAT???"
how nuts  2 say banning AR15  UNCONSTITUTIONAL, or if 1 is on the terror watch list it's ok! Use it on RJ!
USA has so many Attacks Get ur crap 2gether u dont need AR15 2 kill 100 deers in 1 min Ridiculous #Orlando
OMG the @NRA owns the Congress! We have got 2 get rid of these racist white men in Congress! VOTE ppl!
do people in US actually listen to these people before voting them in? Utter moron
Gosh, Senator, think of how many he could have gotten if the NRA could get their way on fully automatics!
Yes he was a terrorist believed in the ideology we have many here in CAN however u dont c this here bc >
we DONT Allow Terrorists or Any1 2 go buy AR15s that shoot 100s of bullets a min! Ppl like u r y beautiful>
Another NRA bought & pd for goon that we get to kick out in Nov 2016. Destroyed Amer w/NRA work alreay
Damn u and those IGNORANT ASSES REPUBLICANS this is why you all will LOSE the HOUSE and the SENATE in Nov
Just keep up your stupid rhetoric long enough and maybe you will convince someone. You should resign
You would do well to stop publicly shilling for the NRA for awhile. At least until the dead are buried.
Weak, evasive arguments by an NRA pawn. Shameful! Common sense regulations will make s difference.
stop semantics. AR 15 semi automatic is weapon of war, even designer says so. Only purpose is to kill many.
watch your interview. You had a chance to really step up and failed. So sad.
what s wrong with you? Owning Assault rifles is an American right....you really believe that nonsense?
if you don't want reasonable gun safety measures to pass, don't campare them to the TSA- which has worked
Good job making wolf look stupid. I cant believe they STILL have no clue what Semi and Automatic guns are
stop being a politician and just stay on the subject of gun control. Sidestepping the ban says you are afraid of the NRA
And he sounds like an idiot.
And he's showing his ignorance about assault weapons. Shame on him. @CNN @wolfblitzer
Right.  Great job dodging gun control and blaming Islamic terrorism.
