CUT THE CRAP. YOU PEOPLE HAD 8 YEARS AND THE CURRENT 6 MONTHS . STOP YOUR GRANDSTANDING.
Glad u see issues, but to me, innovation means clinicians treating ppl the best they can & learning what works better. Get insurance out.
Thank you for voting NO on the #TrumpDeathCare bill. It's a life or death issue for American people.
You wrote that we should loosen up ACA regs. Which?
Rescission?
No coverage for those born with pre-ex conditions?
I was covered those wonderful models you hyped for ppl with pre-ex conditions, it was $25k/year out of pocket before the insurance paid <50%
#ACA at least stopped @BCBSLA and others from doing that to anyone else. Why do you want to let them do this to other Americans?
Insurers should not exclude pre-existing conditions. If you agree, then the risk pools must be large to balance. Mandate or single payer.
..in order to have the best plan possible to cover as many people as we can within the budget constraints that the U.S. currently has.
..what you dislike in the current bill, but no specifics on how to achieve what you want to see. Please provide what steps should be taken..
Private sector Problem Solving = Insuring the healthy for uber profits.
Got on the call, he's talking about medicaid and states waiving essential health benefits.
Great!!! More bankruptcies
"Nah, I don't need emergency room coverage"  gonna regret that if an accident happens and you're hundreds of thousands in debt.
Pretty sure Rep Scalise appreciated that ER coverage.  Shouldn't the rest of us get the same benefit?
Yep, I wonder if the GOP have even made the connection.  Should ask scalese to make his bill public.
pretty sure a person's priorities are pretty fucked up when they decide a little money is more precious than anothers health coverage
There are 27 MILLION that are currently uninsured under Obamacare, w/more drops coming due to unafforability! Please repeal! You have said..
I appreciate you are opposed to this bill although for very different reasons than I. The "market" has too many middlemen, not regulations.
If only there was a way to have a single payer while patients just get care for paying taxes.  Maybe call it Single Payer.  Very simple.
How about single payer like every other 1st world nation?
I, for one would be happy to pay a little more for my insurance so that my neighbor dealing with pre-existing conditions gets covered.
"Consumer-driven, free-market competition" does not work in an environment where service delivery and profit are fundamentally incompatible.

#GOPDONTGIVEAF0CK #GOPHATESICKPOOR #GOPHATESUS #GOPAGAINSTVETS #GOPZOMBIES4TRUMP #Hyprocrasy #TakeMine then #TakeYours #Healthcare
Allowing insurers to charge more for fewer benefits is not #BetterCare
Oh an giving massive tax breaks to millionaires, like Ron Johnson...how much does Our senator stand to personally gain?
Vote no then
Re: addressing employer health care tax deduction. @SenFeinstein & @KamalaHarris have requests from me on that. Hope you can collaborate.
you are an embarassment to WI calling for removal of protection of pre-existing conditions is disgraceful
..appalling level of entitlement, but honest discussion--not harmful PC verbal tiptoe--is needed to salvage the Obamacare mess! Give facts!
BREAKING NEWS #102: #Trumpcare vs #Obamacare

#ACHA #KillTheBill
Trump flipped Johnson to yes! His experience of manufacturing doesn't translate to HC. Can't lower cost by outsourcing to Mexico. #VoteNo
Please stand your ground!  Keep up the good fight for us.
Cutting the risk corridor prematurely was sabotage. Some states refused funding. Some exchanges ended up with unfortunately tiny populations
PLEASE STAND YOUR GROUND. Lives depend on it. Vote NO.
who cares about ur op-eds? you need to grab your balls, go on tv and proclaim your no vote for ahca bill NOW! no more wishwash!
Please confirm that you're not running false flag operation, later to vote "yes" to spoof momentum for@@SenateMajLdr's or rescue the vote.
If it wasn't for ACA my brother would be dead. And my son would be drowning in emergency appendectomy medical bills.
But you people don't want to do that because some you're dark money comes from the healthcare industry. ACA has been sabotage from day one
The only thing that's going to stop Rising costs is government regulations on the healthcare industry plain and simple
Free Healthcare is fine for you.
Please do not support this barbaric legislation, sir.
Please stay strong on ACHA opposition!! We need you! Too many people would be hurt, including my sister. Thank you.
Way to gloss over the pre-existing condition issue...#wishicouldgetmyvoteback
Read your op-ed. FYI Lasix is not life-saving surgery, you know, the kind required to not die. Apalling.

It's hard to think of a *less* populist bill than the GOP health care bill. The bank bailouts qualify, I suppose.
41% of Medicaid recipients in 2015 were children. This is who you're hurting with this bill.
Pro Life until their born.

Spirited debate w/ @RonJohnsonWI just now.  Bottom line: He would rpefer more time but if forced to vote this week, I think he is a yes.
not surprised at all!  He just wanted a little attention on tv!
Remember @SenRonJohnson your constituents are watching. My disabled adult daughter is watching. Vote for the people NOT party!!
The NYT opted to give you column space, and you chose to fill it with vacuous platitudes. Don't vote to kill Wisconsonites.


Medical isn't always something you can shop around for....accidents, heart sticks, strokes, etc.  single payer is what the nation needs!
Please respect what majority of Americans want and vote NO on AHCA.  Fix ACA instead.
You are way off base buddy. Healthcare is a utility. Get the private sector out of it to drive down costs. It's like you don't live here!
By your vote, you are going to show whether your priority is your party or the people of Wisconsin!
Current replacement bill WORSE for WI working class. Gift to super rich. Stand up for us & VOTE NO. We want IMPROVEMENTS. This is NOT a WIN.
Premiums for a 64-year old with middle income would go from $6,800 under ACA to $20,500 under BCRA. Ouch!
WOW. CBO: Premiums for a 64-year old with middle income go from $6,800 under ACA to $20,500 under BCRA  
This will be your deciding moment, if you vote party or people, we are watching
It is terrible to hear these greedy people begging you to take HEALTHCARE away from so many people, I am saddened
That's the KISS principle!  Real simple. I don't have thousands of $$ or insurance so you die. Sorry baby.
I figured you were up to no good with this vote. You did not disappoint.
Can you folks work out a compromise? #HealthcareBill
RonJon claims he wants a bipartisan solution. If he reboots & leads a bill to at least 60 votes, will prove he means it. It's possible.
I want to see that. We need to get this right.
The AP: BREAKING: Congressional Budget Office sees 22 million more uninsured by 2026 under Senate health bill in latest hurdle for GOP.
Its just first phase. Sen Johnson, PLEASE support this bill NOW. We voted for TRUMP! Please support him!!!
Maybe you ought to give up the policy you have now and sign up for that great Ocare policy. Get on board!!!
Prob is Trumpcare looks a lot worse than Ocare. Premiums for a 64-year old w/ middle income go from $6,800 under ACA to $20,500 under BCRA.

Let BOCare fail on it's own!  Let the democrats fail.

150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
Look at you trying to be relevant. We all know you're gonna fall in-line, as long as Koch Bros ask nicely. #GetOutOfTheHeadlines #StopPlayin
No shit.
