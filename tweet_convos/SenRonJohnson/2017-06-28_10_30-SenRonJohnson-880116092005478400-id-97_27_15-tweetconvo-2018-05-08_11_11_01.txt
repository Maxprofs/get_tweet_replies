You want to go back to how we pd for HC in the '40s? What was the life expectancy then? How many ppl didn't go to the dr? #Unbelievable
#wipolitics #Townhall @SenRonJohnson counting on state legislators to better manage Medicaid, high risk pools (as if they'll be better at it
Too afraid to look your constituents in the face and tell them their babies with cancer deserve no coverage? #coward
Town halls NEED to be in person. Don't be a coward. We're going to vote you out if you don't listen to us.
Why would I want to follow you? Your staff was awful when I called.  You are just another GOP frat boy.
#wipolitics #TownHall @SenRonJohnson claims Medicaid expansion only included able-bodied adults. Incorrect.
#wipolitics #TownHall Medicaid Expansion also standardized eligibility across states. http://bit.ly/1vE0LPE 

Why weren't your constituents notified? I had no idea a second "town hall" was happening. Never got called for the first one. #shady
#wipolitics #Townhall @SenRonJohnson doesn't get it. High risk pools = high cost pools

Our "leader" disrespect toward everyone,  but we can all act like adults, "giving some a hand up, others pay their share" per Obama 2012
But you pre-select the questions! That's akin to delivering a PR statement, not an open Town Hall for constituents to ask Qs, get As.
I found the way around this- tell the moderator your question is completely diff then the one you'll be asking-worked for me 2x in a row. 
Do a in person town hall... don't want to face people who will die? coward #GOPHealthcareIsMurder
A start in the listening process, and acting in wi residents best interests.  Please answer our  questions.
#wipolitics #Townhall @SenRonJohnson thinks having people should pay for more of their care out of pocket. (He has money in his pockets)
#wipolitics #Townhall Caller from the high risk pool telling it like it was: unavailable care, high deductibles. Stop calling it successful!
#wipolitics #Townhall I believe we all have the responsibility to help keep Kimberly's daughter alive
#wipolitics #Townhall @SenRonJohnson I want my tax dollars supporting Kimberly's daughter. I want to be in the same risk pool as her
Grow a set.
Vote no on AHCA - to KEEP pre-existing conditions and full Medicaid funding at the federal level.
There is no such thing as a 'Telephone Townhall' Your to Cowardly to stand in front of your electorate @GOP.
Why won't the GOP allow hearings before voting on this bill?
#wipolitics #Townhall I have responsibility to pay more in healthcare premiums than my individual healthcare costs while I can afford to
#wipolitics #Townhall if you get the "mic", plz press @SenRonJohnson on why he's shunting Kimberly's daughter to an unaffordable risk pool
#wipolitics #Townhall 2 year old requiring expensive weekly administered meds. I'm betting @SenRonJohnson doesn't mention lifetime caps
#wipolitics #Townhall Did anyone follow the number juking re: not 22 million people losing insurance?
Stop calling my phone and leaving your creepy voice messages. I don't like you.
#wipolitics #Townhall I think *3 is the code to submit a question. Or online (but you can't talk by submitting it online)
ppl with preexisting conditions are not cars that have been in an accident. Keep preexisting and no lifetime caps of ACA.
U say the private sector is the solution to every healthcare problem. Not always true. Polio was eradicated in US w/out pharma or ins. cos.

On telecall with Senator Ron Johnson. First question, do you find it unacceptable that essential health benefits are removed? His answer: no
What part of  "of the people, by the people, for the people" don't you understand? 

Meet with your constituents already.

#coward

Throw away what you're being handed. And lead. Many won't follow.
But lead. This is what you were born for.
Make America better for everyone
There isn't a second chance.
It was never about Obama. It was never about the deficit. It's about our friends.
Coward

Safety behind a telephone. Also lets you censor your constituents if they ask 'inconvenient' questions.   That's real democracy in action.

Your previous telephone town halls have been a waste of time. Meet with your constituents face to face.
Why not tell the majority leader you want to work with both parties to make sure all Americans have good care?
Boooooo - telephone . Coward.

What about Zoe in Seymour, WI who has a pre-existing condition???
What about special needs children on medicaid?
What about the 2/3 elderly in nursing homes on medicaid???
You don't think people will die without medicaid? #morningjoe What about the 55% of patients on medicaid at Children's Hospital of WI???
what’s worse—murder or the Repub “healthcare” bill?
@senronjohnson



You have health insurance that we pay for but you don't care about over 400,000 in WI that will lose ins. incl. 62,800 children!
People will die who lose medicaid, but you don't care!
I am a pre-existing condition.  You don't care!
Please answer why we will pay more under #Trumpcare and get less?
Pay more for your bill with less benefits!
This @alissascheller graph shows what ACA consumers would have to pay, under GOP bill, to maintain level of benefits http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republican-health-care-bill-kaiser-family-foundation-analysis_us_5952e3c6e4b05c37bb7a5580?section=us_politics … 
Did you announce this earlier and I missed it? Why so little notice?
we'd like an in-person town hall so we can discuss this awful bill.
lol coward
I've left 2 voicemails asking how I can participate in realtime; no comm back. How will you engage all constituents, Senator?
Vote NO. Hold an in-person town hall.
Do them in person.
Where can I find information on your scheduled in-person town halls during the upcoming Congressional recess?
Q: What political cover do you need in order to put a stop to the #AHCA ? I'm not a Koch Brother, but am your constituent & willing to help.
Don't need townhall to know senate bill is garbage. Vote NO.
Another one?  There was one on Monday too.  How about a live town hall?!

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Still won't meet with us face to face huh? But you have all this time to run around to the morning talk shows...
