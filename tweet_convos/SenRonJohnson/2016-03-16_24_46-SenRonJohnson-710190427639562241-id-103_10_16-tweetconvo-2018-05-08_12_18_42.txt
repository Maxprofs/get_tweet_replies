@SenRonJohnson
@SenRonJohnson Obama was not elected for 3/5 of a term. The people have already spoken. Now #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson   This kinda of petty nonsense is why I will not be voting for you this time.   I will no condone this kind of game playing.
@SenRonJohnson The American people already voiced their decision when they elected Obama for four full years. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson The American people elected the President of the United States for a 4 year term. Not 3. Not 3/5 of a term. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson Read the Constitution and do your job. Country before party.
@SenRonJohnson and we can decide not to reelect you giving Wisconsin a new direction
@SenRonJohnson In 2012 the people voted for a 4 year term for President Obama, not 3. #doyourjobcongress #Constitution @POTUS
@SenRonJohnson Yes Senator and that decision will include excluding you from the confirmation process.
@SenRonJohnson Rinos& democraps give illegals, refugees & corp welfare a voice not americans! Elections have consequences!
@SenRonJohnson WE THE PEOPLE decided in Nov 2012 who would choose SCOTUS direction when we elected current POTUS #DOYOURJOB or #LOSEYOURJOB
@SenRonJohnson we get it...you're gonna lose and you're pissed.  Don't go out like a sore loser and do your damn job
@SenRonJohnson #DoYourJob or get out of DC. You aren't earning your paycheck by just sitting in your cozy chair and doing nothing
@SenRonJohnson the voters made their choice - twice. Remember 2008 & 2012? Get over it.
@SenRonJohnson We already voiced our opinion! #DoYourJob. This shouldn't be a fight.
@SenRonJohnson Hey so-called senator. There already is a president, and he won twice. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson same for you.  Will you suspend your work as Senator until we can decide to replace you with Feingold.
@tolfoster @SenRonJohnson By not having hearings on the nominee it appears this senator has already suspended his work.
@SenRonJohnson Since you're up for reelection, please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson Our voice was heard in 2008 and 2016 when we elected the president. I live in Wisconsin and I vote. I do my job. #doyourjob
@SenRonJohnson we decided the direction 3 years ago and elected a 4 year President. #doyourjob
@SenRonJohnson #DoYourJob you corporate puppet
@SenRonJohnson We decided 4 years ago. You are anti-democracy!
@SenRonJohnson be honest. If Clinton wins & esp. if GOP loses Senate, you'll rush to confirm Garland. This is about politics, not philosophy
@SenRonJohnson Our voices were heard for who'd nominate SCOTUS nominees in 08/12. There was no provision  to exclude the last year of a term
@SenRonJohnson The people have already spoken, four years ago, electing Obama to a 4-year term. Stop playing games. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson and a confirmation has never taken more than three months. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson  YOU ARE RUSS FODDER RON .
@SenRonJohnson In 8 months you will be gone do your job now vote on the SCOTUS nominee
@SenRonJohnson The people we're pretty clear about the direction they wanted to go for these four years.  Stop being a sore loser.#SCOTUS
@SenRonJohnson We in Wisconsin also have a voice on the direction, and you my friend are as good as gone. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson we do have a voice. And did in 2008, as well as 2012. We chose a president to fulfill ALL his job descriptions.
@SenRonJohnson Doing nothing for 8 months. Easy job. I say to Senators who refuse to work: No Taxation without Representation (who work).
@SenRonJohnson Don't act like your doing us a favor instead of yourself.
@SenRonJohnson the American people have already spoken! You people need to do you damn job! Or quit!
@SenRonJohnson They did. It's called the 2012 election.
@SenRonJohnson Don't kid us Senator. If you can demand we wait 8 months, you'll just demand we wait four more years after a Dem wins POTUS.
@SenRonJohnson We've spoken, twice! We have a voice @BarackObama . #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson https://www.facebook.com/russfeingold/posts/10153565996728215 â€¦
@SenRonJohnson think Gop is making a mistake on SC. If we lose WH Hillary will stick it to us
@SenRonJohnson voters have already spoken twice, listen to your constituents, stop playing petty politics, #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson not the way it works. Your jobs are to have a court that can make decisions, not block anything and everything POTUS says
@SenRonJohnson Here's my voice, do your job and take notes on the nominee and vote based on their credentials, not political expediency
@SenRonJohnson We've already spoken. Now do your job and hold hearings. Shame on you if you stonewall this.
@SenRonJohnson Our voices were already heard when we voted (twice) for President Obama. Do your job.
@SenRonJohnson Nice try.  #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson I'd rather see the seat filled asap.
@SenRonJohnson neither HRC or DT will appoint a justice that will be conservative.  So hahaha.
@SenRonJohnson The people decided direction for the last 7+ years, President's term is not over. Do your job.
@SenRonJohnson We have a voice - we elected Obama.  YOU and your colleagues are silencing our voice.  Shame on you.
@SenRonJohnson by your logic, pls leave DC and give Russ your office. The ppl will speak loudly this Nov.
@SenRonJohnson With all due respect, sir. The people decided two presidential elections in a row. Our POTUS was elected for 8 years, not 7
.@SenRonJohnson Stop being such a weak coward. Give the #SCOTUSnominee a fair review. He is more than qualified. #DoYourJob or leave office!
@SenRonJohnson   And RoJo will have no part in it... Now or then.
@SenRonJohnson the people have already been given a voice when we elected Barack Obama twice! Would rather not wait!
@SenRonJohnson BHO's 304 Electoral votes were the decision the American people have already made. Your obstructionism will backfire.
@SenRonJohnson haven't the people already decided?
@SenRonJohnson  we already did by electing our current President.  #DoYourJob and have hearings on this nominee.
@SenRonJohnson The American People have decided, twice! President Obama did his job, DO YOURS!!!!
@SenRonJohnson Do you really think Hillary will nominate anyone closer to the center than Garland? Why would u leave this seat open for HRC?
@SenRonJohnson The people have voted for our president TWICE. They already have a voice. Anything else is obstructionist politics.
@SenRonJohnson they had a voice, 3 years ago when they put Obama back in office. Do your job or risk your seat via next election or recall.
@SenRonJohnson We decided in 2012.  Don't you have an election coming up?  #DoYourJob or lose your seat.
@SenRonJohnson The people will also decide if you stay.  Now's a good time to actually DO something for your people instead of the Oligarchy
@SenRonJohnson You sure about that, slapstick? You don't want to do that. Little reminder: Obama in 2008 and 2012.
@SenRonJohnson we did decide. Twice. #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson we already did when we voted for Obama. His administration has not ended.
@SenRonJohnson no, the American people will decide now. #doyourjob
@SenRonJohnson We decided - twice - and the president we elected has 307 days left in term. It's disrespectful to us not to vote. #doyourjob
.@SenRonJohnson #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson We did decide when we elected President Obama. He did his job. How about you #DoYourJob !
@SenRonJohnson do your job, or I predict you will not have one in the near future!
@SenRonJohnson @RDHague Won't that disenfranchise me and others who voted in 2012?
@cavemanjohn @SenRonJohnson @RDHague we aren't Americans i guess.
@SenRonJohnson do your fucking job. If we all waited 8 months to do what we had to at our jobs, we'd be fired. Jackass
@SenRonJohnson We have elected obama to make this choice for us, it is the president's choice. Do your job and conserve the constitution.
@SenRonJohnson In 2008 and 2012, the American people decided OVERWHELMINGLY on the direction of the court. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenRonJohnson 8 month?New POTUS takes over JANUARY, NOMINATION&CONFIRMATION end maybe MARCH 2017? SHUTDOWN SCOTUS for a yr? Ever happened?
@SenRonJohnson As a Republican, I am asking that you #DoYourJob The GOP looks like a bunch of toddlers. We are giving the election away!!
@SenRonJohnson W've already spoken -- tens of millions of us in an overwhelming majority, twice. No getting around this #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson The American people have spoken. Twice (2008 and 2012). Please do the right thing and vet the #SCOTUSnominee
@SenRonJohnson we already had a voice when we elected President Obama. Was that election not valid?
@SenRonJohnson #DoYourJob
@SenRonJohnson Do your job senator
@SenRonJohnson just do your job!! The President is trying to do his. He was elected for 8 yrs and nothing less.
.@SenRonJohnson Furthermore, the new President won't be able to do anything for over 10 months! We can't leave the court in a tie that long!
@SenRonJohnson They had a voice when they elected Obama, who remains in position for 300+ more days. GET OVER IT.
@SenRonJohnson I hear ya!
.@SenRonJohnson  We already did when we elected President Obama! He did his job; you do yours!! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenRonJohnson remember Miguel Estrada
