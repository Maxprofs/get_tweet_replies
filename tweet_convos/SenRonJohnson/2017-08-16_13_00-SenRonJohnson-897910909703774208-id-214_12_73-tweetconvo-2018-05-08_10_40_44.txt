Senator Ron Johnson: #Trump words Tuesday on Charlottesville 'didn't move us closer' http://on.wtmj.com/2wa5Vem  
That's it? DT supports tiki torch carrying terrorists & shames Heather Hayes' memry & this is the best u have?When will it be enough?When?!
From this moment forward the GOP is now complicit in his actions. U r the only ones w/ the power to remove this dangerous man from office.
If you need a reason, try the 25th amendment. Dragging a country into a civil unrest sure sounds like an unfit Potus.
And I blame the @GOP for your utter stupidity and ignorance.
You and @gop supported candidate Trump knowing full well he was running a campaign of divisiveness, stoking the flames of racism and hatred.
U knew this is where it would end up. From his birtherism to refusing to denounce David Duke, there was never any ? about where it would end
Years ago? Really? Because this was last year:
He knew who Duke is. Shouldn't be that hard to disavow a Nazi.
Even if he did, its low hanging fruit. He disavowed Nazis?!? Wow, so does anyone with 1/2 a brain. Actions speak louder than words. Now, act
This nation can neither heal nor unify under Trump.  I think you know that.  Stop stalling and put your country first.
A strong leader you say here we need says this: "TRUMP is wrong on White Supremacy and Nazis." Why is the @GOP so weak, Y afraid of Trump?
Says a multi-millionaire who was willing to vote to throw up to 23 million people off healthcare to deliver tax cuts himself & his donors.
How about stating facts instead of Liberal talking point Lies !
Because you're too lazy to do a google search

Because You choose regurgitate liberal talking points
Because you're brainwashed.
Then trump & his band of racists need to go. Now. Continue to support trump only if you agree with his racist beliefs. #ImpeachTrump
And you need to IMPEACH this racist criminal President NOW!
So repudiate @realDonaldTrump + state the obvious: he is unfit to be @POTUS and must be removed. Otherwise, you're a complicit Nazi-backer.
Can't we just grab em by the pussy and move on?
SAY HIS NAME. Denounce Trump. SAY THEIR NAME. NAZI, KKK, White Supremacy. Denounce them. Be a leader. DO SOMETHING
With trump as pres, republicans only representing Wallstreet, how do you expect that to happen?
We need leaders that believe all violence is wrong then we can unify. Until then you will never unify this country
Trump is right.  With all due respect, you don't have to be politically correct. Get behind Trump 100%
What are YOU doing to move us closer? You have voted 100% with the Trump administration... the Nazi Sympathizing GOP Administration
David duke and the KKK are very fine people.  Maybe we should look to them to help heal this nation.
I blame the Mexicans, after all they're all rapists.

and yours! #weak

Members of Congress must go further than condemning hate and bigotry. Demand they turn their words into action! #rachelmaddow 
Why do you not join the handful (12) other Republicans and call out our @POTUS for what he is: A racist?
I don't think you're one of them unfortunately!!!
another great statement from a Rep from Congress!
We close tonight with our #QOTD. 
You are correct, Senator!  Hoping you and @SenatorBaldwin will honor your constituents and #impeachtrump

Obviously you aren't one of them. Just because you're *safe* until 2022, doesn't mean you're safe. We will remember.
The handicap don't help either, I mean, have you seen them?  They're like, duh, I don't remember.
. @SenRonJohnson 
No, the patriots in this country need to kick the nazis and KKK to the ground. And vote out their cowardly enablers.
Removal of Trump & most of his admin is a good start. Includes lying racist Sessions. #ImpeachTrump This is on you GOP.
until trump specifically tells kkk, David duke, Nazis & white supremacists that he rejects their support, we cannot unify.
Unify with domestic terrorism? Unify with organized violent murdering American Nazis and White Supremacists? THIS IS YOUR ADVICE? Y so weak?
We are all counting on you to be on the right side of history. @realDonaldTrump does not understand the character if this nation. #impeach
Fear not. He knows what he is doing.
Call this racist president out by name.
A coward who wants to "move on".
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/08/16/censure-president-trump-editorials-debates/572994001/ … #CensureNow
Trump is unfit to be president! He also needs to be censured!
Are you going to defend Lindsey?

http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/08/16/seth_meyers_on_trump_s_ridiculous_charlottesville_press_conference_video.html … Listen to Seth!
@SenRonJohnson The President is unfit, what are you going to do about it!? #Impeach45
We are not moving on until every republican says the words "radical white nationalist terrorists" and condemns trump for defending them!
This is simply one over the easiest things to do - NAME racism and the people who support it = TRUMP.
first thing you have said with which I agree.  Would  like to hear more refusal to accept white supremacist policy/protection

Will you?
POTUS isn't a national nanny. We need adults acting like adults and a facts-only media outlet. Still awaiting that peaceful transition...
Shameful Ron Johnson, you needed Trump to win your election, now you show who you are. Fair weather friends are a dime a dozen 
Yeah cool. Hey remember how you killed Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorist but gave Trump a pass on white suremacy? Be better.
Yes, and that includes you. "You tell Me???!"  Shame on you.  Call out racism by name-don't look away and move on. You represent ALL of us.
Why are GOP Senators not calling for Trump's resignation?! Nixon resigned when Goldwater & Rhodes demanded it. They're in bed with him. 
NO.  THEY HAVE LONG AGO proven they won't do it (with a few exceptions).  What WE NEED IS #ThePeople to take responsibility and heal it
Here is what Traitor Trump needs to say: I RESIGN. Nothing else is acceptable. He should be executed for treason.
Impeaching 45 would be a good start.
If this is your opinion, than my opinion is: You need to step down and let some real leaders lead our nation.
Isn't that you @SenRonJohnson ? Speak against #45 instead of this weak platitude
Dear Senator, we need 'a leader', not the presenter son in the WH.
So you're saying you are not a leader? Show some actions to back your empty words!
We will NOT unify with this pussy-grabbing, Nazi-sympathizing, consumer fraud-committing son of a bitch.
@SenRonJohnson start healing by stating in plain words:  White supremacy is wrong and evil.

@SenRonJohnson is part of white supremacy.  Not entirely comfortable with @realDonaldTrump ?  Evil response.
Like claiming McCain made his vote due to brain cancer helped unify the nation???
Pretty weak statement. Checks and balances. You have the power to fix this.
U wanna heal this nation....get rid of Trump
So you wanted Trump to lie, to not have the courage to truthfully point out both sides were guilty.  Truth can't heal the nation???
Thank you for saying this.
@620wtmj You need to stand up to Trump and has alt-right administration
Remember when U criticized Obama 4 not using the words "Radical Islamic Terrorism?"
Did U even notice when U became hypocrite on terrorism?
My father and uncles fought the Nazis. No, we are not just moving on. #Complicit #Silence=SupportForNazis
Stand up and BE THAT LEADER.  Your oath is to our country
Start with yourself!  Listen to all your constituents in unscripted town halls, build opportunities for dialogues about inequality! Lead us
I have no intention to "unify" with nazi terrorists.
Federal courts: Your white supremacist Wisconsin GOP suppressed black voter turnout in Milwaukee. 
Is Mitch the leader you want to heal?
You need to be replaced!
Then tell him he's wrong, so very wrong. Tell him that we are ashamed and he must change or resign. Tell him that that he is hurting the USA
Starting with the POTUS? Shameful you stand by COMPLICIT to Trump's Racism
@620wtmj 
And you stand silently, it's time to call POTUS out!
This is all you can say?   You know  what Trump is and you supported his divisive policies.
we should stop harping on what trumpty-dumpty said? Thsts is crap. He's suppose to lead not be a turd.
Good, glad you think so... now start the impeachment process = that is the ONLY thing that can possibly "heal this nation & unify it."
So want to move on. Seriously?  Head in sand never worked for anyone. Tomorrow is another day. There'll be another trump moment. Guaranteed
Unless you demand @potus' resignation or impeachment, you condone a white supremacist in chief.
No they didn't and we aren't "moving on".  #corruptraitor #impeachtrump
It's called "truth and reconciliation" for a reason.  You can't unify the nation if you can't admit that your party's racism is dividing it.

This is what Senator Johnson Supports
so is that an UNendorsement of Trump?
Is there one positive response here? Well then wake up
And you want to throw seniors into a last chance pool?
Exactly. #impeach45now
And we are not moving past this.
Bist du noch bei Sinnen?? We German Americans are watching this and can't fathom your responses here!!
Then you need to get rid of that douche in the white house.he is not a leader. By not removing him u are not leaders either.#urcomplicit
Are you saying that everyone that voted for Trump knew he was a nazi? I hope for America's sake you're wrong.
This is the best you can do? Shame on you.
That's the best you can do?  Pathetic. 2018 cannot come quickly enough.
Please call @realDonaldTrump out and let him know that is part of his job description and he is failing!

Impeach or side with the fascist. It's your choice!
Start by stopping Trump TODAY
U want 2 move on frm addressing the supremacists in The White House & what they hv wrought? Short attention span or questionable priorities?
By refusing to condemn his rhetoric, you're condoning 45's hatred and racism. History will demand to know which side you were on.
Leaders don't "move on" until the issue is resolved. And they don't say "you tell me?" when asked what Trump should have said. Pathetic.
It won't happen if you don't recognize the hate found in #blm #anarchists.
Shame on you
It's obviously not you. Shame on u - condemnation is the only right answer.
So quit being a coward and stand up for what is right! Do you really want your legacy to be tied to Trump?!? Time is running out!
How about if we start by showing some backbone and standing up to the President who has disgraced the office, and has only just begun.
Your a big part of t problem! Mealymouth, fearful, liar, don't stand for anything, &won't stand with  our president! U&you're kindR Tproblem
Do something
as long as you stand with the orange menace & alt right sympathizer 45, YOU & GOP are complicit and on the same level as he is

#removeTrump
@620wtmj If you want to heal this nation and unify it, remove @realDonaldTrump from office. #ImpeachTrumpNow
I am one of your constituents, I called your office yesterday, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS - @realDonaldTrump is a national disgrace
I agree completely Senator.  Too bad leadership continues to focus on dividing the country.   Perhaps a leader will step up soon?
"Johnson was uncomfortable about Trump's comments for 'the same things that make the American people uncomfortable.'"

What things exactly?
"Johnson said he doesn't believe the president is racist. Pressed, he said 'because I just don't think so.'"

What makes a racist, Senator?
Before you can heal, you must first identify the sickness and who is spreading it. By Name. Anything less is lip service.
No, there will be no unity under this president. If you want to side with President Nazi, that's on you.
Seriously should have been much stronger words. You need to call out @realDonaldTrump
YOUR sheet is showing!
DEFEND A RACIST - YOU ARE A RACIST! GOP senator ready to 'move beyond' Trump's racially charged comments http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senator-ready-move-beyond-trumps-racially-charged-comments … via @msnbc
Tell that to Antifa groups or the mainstream media! They are full of hate! I stopped watching in January. They are liars and corrupted!
You sir are a coward and complicit in this.  This is not about politics anymore.  If you can't see that it's time for you to resign.
Agreed, why don't you do so!  Oh, I forgot you're not running for reelection!
Will you encourage Sean Duffy to sign #censuretrump ??
We'll stop "harping on" racists words when he stops saying them. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Have ya talked to donnie about his love for nazis? Tool
All of you are liars and racists. You're saying, you wanna "move beyond" Trump's racial crap? No. You don't get to throw a blanket on it.
What exactly do you plan to do about it?
please don't suggest you've ever done this????   you obstructed Obama at every turn & remained silent throughout Trump's campaign to present
It's not going away, not just a distraction. It's about race/hatred, the future of this country. GOP gave us Trump.
You are the leader! And your right we sure NEED leaders baecause I don't see you doing anything but mumbling. For crying out loud.
And we are going to Keep Harping On the @GOP to censure @realDonaldTrump - #NoPlaceForHate
We are not going to heal with a POS as POTUS
We won't heal, as long as the LIBERAL LEFT, stokes flames of racism, to divide & distract the country, to advance their political agenda !!
Then work to #Impeach
#impeachtrump
Why don't you try being one then.
Thank goodness you came out so strongly! And only a few days after it happened! How do you live with yourself?
We need you to actually have a spine.  Pathetic.  Can't wait to vote you out.
@620wtmj what's your excuse? You're on the wrong side of history.
@SenRonJohnson already demanded we move on yesterday instead of addressing the white supremacy issue.
There is no w.s. issue. A few hundred people in the usa doesnt account for anything.
If you don't dump Trump you're carrying the torch for the New Republican Party.
Wonderful. So why don't you disavow bigots & racists among your party & voters? Afraid of losing the #KKKTrump vote? #ProfilesInCowardice
You should speak these words to your president!!!!!
This country can't "move on" until your party does something about our Nazi sympathizer president. It's on you, now
I'm glad you feel that way. Come to Milwaukee and let's talk about race and how we can bring this healing to our nation. Do you have a plan?
Yeah, that great unifier Trump is doing a heckuva job. MAGA!
Just more talk. Ineffective congress must be voted out.
Wow. Try again RonJohn... weak. 
#Complicit #ImpeachTrumpNow #25thAmendmentNow
Are you talking about unifying me, the son of a Holocaust survivor, with Nazis and their president? Forget it.
So what's your plan, deadbeat dad?  Maybe you guys need to impeach the white supremacist in the WH...
Really, Wisconsin? You couldn't have done better than this?

Well, you are the state that gave us Joseph McCarthy
Then get rid of him and his whole basket of deplorables. Talk is cheap!  Do something for this country for a change!
Yeah? If you believe that, condemn @realDonaldTrump. Are you complicit or a coward??
He must be REMOVED by the GOP. You are complicit if you continue to do nothing. #45MustGo
@GOP trying to appease their racist base and what's morally right.
LET'S HEAR YOUR IDEAS.  NOT JUST YOUR THOUGHTS AND FUCKING PRAYERS.
Then dump Trump!!
I think you need to read Rep Gallagher's statement.  He rebuked Trump and his racist statements!  I respect Rep Gallagher, no you.
Lame. . . Not nearly enough. Your party is done and so are you.

Tired of questions about Trump defending white supremacists? How quick did you move off of Benghazi? Time to take a stand.
You're allowing racism to fester with this comment. You're complicity racist whether you realize it or not
Yeah, we need leaders to condemn Nazis. We're waiting, Ron.
I'm sorry senator but the truth sometimes hurts. What POTUS did was tell the truth. No spin just the truth. ANTIFA is a hate group as well
True. POTUS isn't even pretending to hide his racism. He stood up and declared himself a racist supporter of the KKK, as he always was.
I used to like this guy.
This is the strongest statement you can muster?? Need action from you--not just words. WI is watching.

You need to publicly disavow the comments made by President Trump. Those from Wisconsin don't behave like that. Find some spine
Sir it is obvious that Mr. Trump is unable to discharge the duties of his office.  Please take the lead in removing him from office.
What did you want him to do Lie?
Your comment is not helping.
You're obviously not a leader trying to unite us.
Practice what you preach.
Hey Ron, you can start by forcefully denouncing #DonaldTrump and his neo-Nazi buddies by name.
So be a healer,Jesus incarnate.Trump calls it like he sees it,and if you paid attention,you would acknowledge it.
You're a leader. What are you doing? Note: Some wounds can't be healed, & some grievances can't be overcome. Some ppl don't deserve respect.
Weak statement. Trump needs to stop actively harming this nation and causing division.
Refusing to repudiate the left wing violence from #Charlottesville means they CONDONE IT! Both sides were equally violent!!
