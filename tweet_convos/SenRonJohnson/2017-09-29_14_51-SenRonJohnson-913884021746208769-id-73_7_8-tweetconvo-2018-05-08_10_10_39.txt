WOW: U.S. Senator Ron Johnson tells group of high school students that food, health care and shelter are all "limited resources" that should only be given to those that have earned the "privilege" and can "afford those things." https://www.facebook.com/wisn12/videos/10159493605030284/ …
Never call my personal phone again for your BS town hall conference calls. You are a GOPPOS who stole that seat w/BS smear ads on Feingold.
I don't think we should pay for your health care.  Find it on your own.
You know what's a privilege that Republicans assume is their right? Being paid by voters while taking every opportunity to screw them over.

KYS, POS.

Hi, Ron. Just wanted you to know you're a worthless piece of trash. Take it easy.
Ron Johnson, "I married into mine- the hell with the rest of you!"

Congress just let the Children's Health Insurance Program expire. States will start to run out of money w/o action.

So embarrassing for WI!
Your position and your health care and your wages are a ‘privilege’ that the American people have granted you, temporarily.
A lot of people call you the dumbest person in congress but you have good competition now from Roy Moore.
Of 25 wealthiest nations, the USA is the only country not to recognize health care as a right, & providing it to their citizens. You kill.
Food is a privilege? No Ron. It's a necessity. Health care is also a necessity.
Dear @ABCofWisconsin & @StevensConsCorp Run while U can. He's taking #CHIP and giving us assault rifles. #vegasshooting #CHIPExpired

Seems like being an idiot senator is a privilege for pampered Ronny boy.



Our country would be better off without you. Go sit on a traffic cone.
is shelter a privilege or a right?
What kind of disgusting human tells kids they don't have a right to LIVE? You're not"pro-life," you're pro-forced-birth. Resign in disgrace
You are shitting me, right?
.... HEALTHCARE is a privilege...?
Shelter a privilege...?
#NoMoreTerms

Hierarchy of needs.
What was that crap you told those kids about healthcare not being right ? You just pulled shit out of your ass and flung at those kids

#45's latest tweets from the golf course are not to be tolerated. Americans are dying. You"re silence =complicity. Repub=racist
Hehe, some folks have been HAD, BIGLY. http://wapo.st/2xDT8Bl?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.76761abc4858 …. Trump SWAMP CREATURES TAKE OVER ALL PARTS OF GOVERNMENT.
Trump supporters, listen up.. you've been HAD. BIGLY when u hired the fox to guard the chicken house. VERY SAD!
When will you hold a real town hall? I thought you tea partiers loved those things. Meet w/ your constituents, coward.
Sir. Did you really say healthcare is a privilege? Man, wouldn’t it be funny if life got at you so fast...
Did they ask why you think health care is a privilege and not a right? You're as cold as Trump.
When are you going to face the voters in your state?  #coward #exploitingkids
Life is a right-without food shelter and medical care there is no life. #brainwashingkids
How about facing your constituents in a town hall meeting? 
& why doesn't #TrumpTaxScam look great for our most vulnerable families?
A few thoughts on this. I’m not seeing *anything* that benefits the lowest-income 35% of TPs, while the top 1% gets trillions of tax cuts. https://twitter.com/Goldfarb/status/913045734366248960 …

Treasury takes down 2012 paper that contradicts Mnuchin's claim that workers benefit most from a corporate tax cut.
