A great way to thwart the left-wing loonies to want to disrupt town halls!
Tele-town hall?Shows your indifference to peoples lives!These are REAL people,not line items on a budget;Show up and face your constituents!
Why not do it IN PERSON during the next senate vacation?  What are you afraid of? There is no such thing as a 'telephone' town hall mtg.
"There is a smarter way of doing it"  re: funding insurance with pre-existing conditions.  What's your smart way? High risk pools don't work
I did sign up, but you didn't call me. So much for wanting to hear from your constituents before voting on the healthcare bill.
You had 8 years of whining about the ACA and now you need more time to fix the problem? Governing is a lot harder than obstructing isn't it?
Why are you doing this on a holiday weekend when most people will be out celebrating the birth of this great nation?
"There is nothing wrong with making a profit"  Getting people addicted to opiates has been quite profitable.
Coward.
Why do you refuse to meet face to face in a town hall meeting? This is just a way to get people's phone numbers and email.
The call came in at 5:37
Caller says person could not get healthcare with high risk pools before ACA. Now he's dead.
Agree that ACA did not fix healthcare, but it did more and helped more people than anything the GOP has come up with.
In tele-town hall you say CBO score is based on people leaving because of choice. Wrong! 15 mil kicked off Medicaid.
Where is my phone call?  I have signed up twice before and have only ever got one phone call

Spirited debate w/ @RonJohnsonWI just now.  Bottom line: He would rpefer more time but if forced to vote this week, I think he is a yes.
Faux townhall...scripted and censored
Thank you sir for not hiding.  I really appreciate that you aren't refusing to meet with people and talk this out.  #countryoverparty
oh a phone call. Did you lose your testicles?
Coward!
Family phyisican on call saying healthcare is incredibly complicated. Healthcare is inelastic -- free market doesn't work.
Healthcare is not a free market commodity. Stop trying to over simplify a complex problem.
Women on call has insurance b/c of ACA. You say you don't want to take insurance away.  Good! Then vote no.
Caller wants to know how to stop fraud in SS. Do you know what stops fraud -- regulations!  Regulations that you are gutting.
You don't know anyone that wants to pollute-- maybe you should take a look at your campaign donors.
I agree that these telephone town halls are a cheap route to go. You do both? When? We want an in person town hall.
What is happening with this town hall? Haven't rec'd call to join yet. Many on your Facebook page saying the same. Signed up last yesterday.
Vote no on bill. This bill is atrocious. Work on fixing ACA not destroying it.

For the first time ever tens of 1000's of small co. and self-employed WI ppl h/ good insurance. Don’t take it away.
.@USCBOcostest  reports coverage changes under the Senate #HealthcareBill: uninsured increases largest among lower income people 
Next time, please tell us what time you're holding the telephone town hall so we can plan better. More than one day's notice too, please.
Only a pussy would hold a telephone Townhall.
I called @SenRonJohnson today. No staffer -just told to leave a message on my healthcare concern. HIPAA violation? Anyways leave it anyways.

Watch this. It's fucking disgusting. https://twitter.com/rawstory/status/879303278462455810 …
Vote no
Good to see @SenRonJohnson making an effort to stand up/listen to constituents.

BUT! I don't expect an hour-long call to cut it.

Vote no on taking #Healthcare from people who needs and handing millions to the wealthiest #goploss2018
I have a preexisting condition. I donated a kidney. Still think I deserve to pay more for insurance? Yeah cause you're a monster.
.@SenRonJohnson The House voted to take Americans' health care away. Don't make the same mistake. #ResistTrumpcare

1 of the biggest effects of the #wealthcarebill will be the meat axe to #Medicaid. America, most #GOP r abt THEIR wealth, not your health. 
What the heck?  Please explain in your telephone town hall!!!

The GOP wrote a bill in 5 weeks in secret that'll impact 1/6 of economy. They'll destroy health care for tax breaks. 
Cant wait till ur constituents hear nursing home pts will loss coverage &? be killed, thrown out? do u care if they dont vote. Callous reps.
No Trumpwealthcare
Too chicken to meet with your constituents face to face?..You'll all fall into place, it's just a charade. GREED is GOP motivator NOT HC..
If you aren't committed enough to defend your positions to your constituents in person, they're probably not defensible positions.

#coward
@IndivisibleMad Vote NO!

Sheldon Adelson doesn't need a $48 million tax cut. But working families do need health care. 

Fight back: http://trumpcaretoolkit.org  
Afraid to face constituents? All you're worried about is the big tax break you're going to vote for yourself and the rest of the 1%

Our #veterans, who answered the call to defend their nation, face a life or death battle to protect their health care from the #Republicans 
Auto insurance? How are our lives even compared with this?
Johnson is simply afraid of his constituents. His real goal is no health care whatsoever, except for his elite buddies. Just another hater.
Coward! Have a face to face! #LIAR #PAYTOPLAY
Next summer I will be moving to Minnesota!  I will not support gerrymandering and your extreme policies!  Say goodbye to my portion of taxes
Coward
How about real meetings with real Wisconsin voters?
You're phoning it in?!?! So disappointing!
You should meet your constituents in person
Thank you for doing a telephone town hall. In-person town halls are very difficult for me.
Please do not support AHCA.
These are really fucking inconvenient.  Call from random # at dinner time.  Just another way for you to not have to face your constituents.
I absolutely don't consent to receiving robocalls, but do want my elected official to hear my voice. How shall I sign up?
HOLD REAL TOWNHALL MEETINGS!
On 6/23/17, I submitted formal invite via @SenRonJohnson website for a non-partisan Healthcare Listening Session during Aug recess. Join us.
Please propose amendment subjecting Congress to TrumpCare.  No exceptions.  I dare you.
We want an open town hall without pre-screened calls.
Town hall means you actually meet face to face with people of a town
VOTE NO ON AHCA #CARENOTCHAOS #VoteNoAHCA

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
#NOCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair.
