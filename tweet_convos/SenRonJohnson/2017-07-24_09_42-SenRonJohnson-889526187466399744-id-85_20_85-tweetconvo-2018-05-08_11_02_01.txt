So you decided to screw over Wisconsinites. We will vote against you!
Coward.

Fun graphic on @SenRonJohnson of Wisconsin. 
Healthcare: vote NO on repeal. Use your sacred vote to do the right thing today for all of us out here.
You voted yes to debate a bill that you haven't read? Way to serve your constituents.  But that's not why you're in Washington, is it? $$$$
@SenRonJohnson Please, please- any replacement hurts, kills. And the economy suffers.
Why aren't you there, voting NO this afternoon? Do the right thing Ron!!
Murderer.
Repeal Obamacare
Spineless coward. Millions will lose insurance in the most undemocratic and secretive "process" ever.
Vote No!!!! McConnell can promise anything but he cannot guarantee and won't be able to come through for you! Help us!!!

You are horrible.
#GotIntegrity?? 

So much for the "Peoples party" 

Rich need tax cuts!
Do the right thing for your constituents, #VoteNo today!
BSA, why did you invite a MANIAC and BUFFOON to address young impressionable children?
Vote NO for the Senate HC bill. This is so wrong, even for the does soulless GOP. This madness has to stop.
Please vote NO Senator.  This is not the way this vote should take place. Trump, Pence, McConnell, Ryan only doing it for a legislative win.

Alexis Scott is one of almost 500,000 veterans who would lose Medicaid under the Senate bill. Share your story: https://handsoff.org/  
If you can't stand up for our most vulnerable in WI then you have no business calling yourself a United Stated Senator! @GOP #KillTheBill
We voted you spineless worms in for repeal NO REPLACE!
Nothing less than #FullRepeal #RootAndBranch.

7,000 Nuns

Please remind those who don't understand, #BCRA denies access. Junk policies or unaffordable pre-ex pools = no access, no chemo, radiation.

Called my @SenRonJohnson to tell him to vote no on this healthcare bill. Again.

Surprising no one, all 3 of his VMs are full/off. Again.
But how cool does he look in that plane?


Please vote no!!
Sen Johnson, I believe u appreciate that Mitch McConnell is doing serious harm to our norms of transparency & open debate. Please vote no 
Please listen to former GOP Senator from Minnesota, David Durenberger. Resist the bullying. We must do better. http://amp.usatoday.com/story/50297600 …

How could you possibly vote on something hidden, that you haven't even reviewed and with so many lives at stake? Please #VoteNoToTrumpCare
Great photo op.  This mean you are voting no on the #Trumpcare bills in either form tomorrow since you have time for that.
30 million AARP members want you to vote NO to repeal. And BOY do we vote!
Tomorrow's health care vote is an accountability vote for AARP. We urge all Senators to #VoteNo. https://press.aarp.org/2017-07-21-AARP-Keeps-Heat-on-Legislators-to-Oppose-Health-Care-Bill-Repeal …
I hope you enjoy yourself. Please remember millions of Americans are too worried about losing healthcare to have fun. Please vote NO
Please please do not make the citizens of this country's healthcare, about a win for Trump. Please vote no I beg you
You misspelled SHITSHOW
Enjoy the air show! Don't be bulled by McConnell!
don't allow Trump to bully you...vote NO on the repeal...don't be like Paul Ryan
We don't, you just don't know what the Bible says in all the other verses YOU DON'T READ!!!!
Sure, not every Christian. Many are models of humility and charity. What I think TMP is saying is that the current GOP replace plan is cruel
thank you for clarifying Woke Bro

.@wholeexpanse, who has spinal muscular atrophy and depends on Medicaid for his care, shares his fears about what cuts could mean for him: 
I am trying to pay off a Half a million dollar medical Bill, and I did have Insurance and paid all my bills, Who do I cry to?
Why On God's earth would you vote on something you don't know what's in it,? Is that your America!? Stripping millions from Healthcare?
Vote NO on Repeal, Repeal & Replace, or Procedure.
Welcome to a world of the GOP without ethics
Don't be bullied!  The ACA is working fine in Wisconsin.  Absurd for McConnell to have a vote before Senate comes up with any improvements.
And pictured here, one of the worlds largest parasites and out-of-touch one-percenters sits in an airplane.
Just imagine how many people watching EAA depend on #Medicaid! Put your constituents first!#KeepKidsCovered #DontCapMyCare #DoctorsSpeakOut
Great time for our area!  I do have to add, I oppose privatization of air traffic control.
Please say “No” to ATC privatization!
