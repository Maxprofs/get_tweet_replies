You are from Wisc. Would you want Scott Walker and assembly responsible for YOUR child's health care? #TheResistance
No but much better than those incompetent bureacrats  in Washington
These are the clowns that gerrymandered in secret to rig all future elections. And were proud of it when caught
So elect competent bureaucrats.  Imagine a government committed to solving problems.  The post office, Medice, SS all work fine. Not all bad
Government is always corrupt and incompetent.....folks leave office millionaires...Big Government never works
Agreed. In wisc they are not even good at stealing. Ham handed and unapologetic. Bullies. At least the big boys buy me a drink first
And strips 32 million of Healthcare coverage increasing economic uncertainty of families and straining hospitals and nursing homes.
No, that was BOcare!
Worked well for me, premiums went down each year, and saved my eyesight so people like you don't have to pay my disability.
Well, as long as you're good, the millions that lost their doctors and insurance don't matter .
Check your facts... Fewer people uninsured now.
You're arguing with a bot. Ignore them. Block them.
Who’s a bot?!?  Every health care organization/provider/ policy expert in the country thinks Graham-Cassidy is a disaster, including me.
It's just another government program. Government is the problem, not the solution! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SecPriceMD
Why can’t you get it into your skull that we the people don’t want the ACA repealed unless you replace it with universal coverage.
We are not the fringe, we are the majority.  The 20% who were in favor of Graham-Cassidy likely didn’t understand it and won’t re-elect you.
You, sir, are an embarrassment to the great state of Wisconsin, as Trump is an embarrassment to the great USA. The former @GOP is dead. RIP
People are not idiots.  Just stop.
Your constituents are outraged that you support this death Bill. Why aren't you?
'We are outraged': Thousands of faith leaders oppose GOP health care bill http://huffp.st/7sZWyRS  
When has federalism ever been a part of your discussions w/constituents? Answer is never.
And this is the deal you are supporting? You represent Wisc, not Louisiana.
As long as OUR state provides medicaid to the elderly and disabled. I am a pre existing condition. Without Medicaid I die, as do millions.
Tell us exactly how that works.
You are just like Joe McCarthy that other senator from Wisconsin that had no decency. VOTE NO and show a little compassion.
And state's rights to let their citizens die for lack of access to care
Like the Wisconsin governor cares about his citizens
Yes, with less money for some people. Less care for all people. Do u work  4 ins comp, trump or citizens. I hope Wisc throws u out
Western Europe, with various approaches combining public/private, provides better health care at 2/3 of US cost.  Analyze that, Senator...
Senator Ron Johnson, I don't believe that to be in Americans best interest. Please vote NO on GCHJ!
It is curious to me that u desperately want to tie your name to this failed piece of legislation- AKA GC.  Stop trying to make fetch happen.
Voting yes? So you want people to die when sick? Why hide the bill, unless you know it will kill off americans. Hey, dead people don't cost

Seriously Senator? Only one hearing on legislation that affects 1/6 of our economy? How is that conservative? Seems reckless.
SenJohnson, The AMA has spokn out Against GrahamCassidy. GC will TAKE Ins. from 30mill. PPL.Including many of your most vulnerble supporters
You will be voted out you've shown us you failed all you think about is yourselves not American people
A yes vote is a victory for the wealthy and death to the poor and people like me with a pre-existing condition. You have no clue on policy.
It must be nice to sit on Washington with full benefits that you dont pay for& never have to worry about losing no matter what health issues
No senator. You have failed Wisconsin and we are coming for you in 2018. We will not forget.
why won't u listen?!  I voted for you!
The hell it.does.
It's devastating for children, families, elderly, and people with disabilities. It's devastating for people with preexisting conditions.
Vote NO on Graham/Cassidy.

Disabled protesters were removed from #GrahamCassidy hearing in their wheelchairs after the GOP left the room so they didn't have to watch. 
#GrahamCassidyBill guts medicaid!!!
#GrahamCassidyBill kills #KillTheBill

Revised Senate health bill is “all about buying Republican votes” https://bloom.bg/2y4yXNG  
That's just plain ridiculous! There is no guarantee of healthcare if the States are in charge. Health care should be a right not a $ issue.
You obviously don't listen to your constituents

You couldn’t answer a simple question  & kept stumbling around.And yes,it’s considered a bribe to give more money to states for a yes vote

Here's your #MondayMotivaton to call @lisamurkowski @senatorcollins @robportman & @SenCapito and ask them to #SaveOurCare (202-224-3121) 
Why vote YES on GCHJ when a promiesed no vote gets your state more money?  Or does WI deserve less than AK, AZ, ME, and KY?
@GeorgeMentz #FALSE ! It's a death sentence for many Americans!  You Republicans are evil dicks
Your aides can't answer "How does this improve health and economy of WI"; still looking for explanation from you! Thx
This will kill people
Giving the States a cookie while Congress holds the strings does not salve the problem.

A YES vote on GCHJ is a victory for racists and helps put 30 million people off insurance and Obama out of the popular vernacular.
As one of your constituents, if you had any sense (or balls) at all, you'd remove your name from this horrific healthcare bill & vote no.

 BREAKING: Insurance commissioners: Graham-Cassidy will "severely disrupt" markets with "sharp premium increases and insurer exits"  
How does gutting Medicare and cut protections for ppl with preexisting conditions give ppl the  ability to make decisions?

Every medical organization is against Graham-Cassidy 1.0 and 2.0 is WORSE! VOTE NO! #noGrahamCassidy
You should be good and dizzy from all that spinning.  This is a lie.
Happy National Sociopath Day!  How have abandoned your conscience today?
If  you're so pro states rights, why do you wish to preclude CA and NY from enacting single payer and prevent states from legalizing MJ?
Your a a liar just like Ryan
Your party lost that war in 1865.  Give it up, Johnson.
Then coverage 4
Pregnancy preexcond the elderly the disabled childrn if they could afford it will lose coverage THIS IS PURE EVIL SHAMEonU
You represent donors @GOP $
You do not care that I will be without affordable health care.
You do not care about millions that will lose.
This bill is bad for every citizen of WI and the US. Not just my opinion. Doctors, Hospitals and Insurers agree. The bill is evil.
Enjoy the rest of your tenure. You will be voted out for your decision to lie about the health care bill
So you believe it's ok that a child born in one state can have better access to healthcare than in another? Sick
Everyone who matters knows you're lying. Liar.
With Federal money.
Sir, that is not true.
Listen to your constituents. Listen to the medical associations.
Bull 
Why do you need to bribe some senators then??!
Lie
...which is a shitty idea. Vote no.
Are you willing to pay premium increases for all of us with preexisting conditions? If not then resign now
No, @SenRonJohnson 
No it doesn't. Shame on you for lying to the American people. SHAME
You're a lying snake who works for Koch Bros campaign $$ not American citizens. #Greedy #sleazy #unAmerican #SaveOurCare
Just heard  RJ defending his hot mess GCHJ on WBEZ/Chgo: if they lose this week, will attach to next bill (tax reform); will sink that too 
The entire health care system is against this bill. It will kill Americans.
You are a huge lying SOB!
SHAME on U Ronny for LYING about this bill: https://www.ahip.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Joint-statement-AMA-AAFP-AHA-FAH-AHIP-BCBSA-9.23.17.pdf …
...and makes it okay for insurance companies and states to decide if you get to keep or afford your insurance or die trying.
VOTE NO ON THIS CRAP BILL!!!!
Passing #GCHJ would destabilize insurance markets, kick millions of Americans off their chosen insurers, taking away healthcare decisions
it does not insure for preexisting conditions.  Each state can and will put its citizens in peril
NO IT DOES NOT.
GCHJ will make Americans poorer and sicker. I thought you were suppose to watch out for your constituents.
I'm sorry.  The only health decision I can make is not going to the doctor.  Because I can't afford to.  Wisconsin deserves better.
Vote NO
Which funeral home to use ?
The bill undermines protections for people with pre-existing conditions and people who need treatment for opioid abuse by allowing states
Why? Because states would have incredibly broad discretion in how they use the vague waivers in the proposal.
No, it will disenfranchise those least able to afford the costs of healthcare; and do nothing to address the actual problems.
I'm confused.  So why is EVERY professional medical associations opposed to this bill?  Please explain this.
Sad. Please vote NO.
A yes vote for GCHJ is a vote against millions of American lives. #ghcj #GrahamCassidy #DumpTrump
Lol why would I want Scott Walker in charge of my healthcare? Please. Tell me why.
trumpcare is bullsh*t and our know it.
I am ashamed to be represented by you.
Nope
Once again you choose not to listen to the will of your constituents who understand this bill is unconscionable.  You only care about $$$
How out of touch and deluded you are.
You say you are doing what your constituents ask, yet I struggle to find any who agree with you here. Who are you really working for?
Major physicians' groups oppose it to uphold their Hippocratic oath: first do no harm
Liar!
Vote no. This bill is bad for America
How do the morally bankrupt members of the GOP sleep at night?  http://wapo.st/2fIkaNO?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.bcb60deb2ab6 …. SHAME ON U RONNY!
Without insurance millions of American incl. your constituents will choose between ER and DEATH. #grahamcassidy WILL KILL PEOPLE.
No, it's not. Please don't vote yes and subject us to this.
I really wish you would try to represent all of Wisconsin, not just the rich.
The government should operate for the good of the citizens, not for the interest of the several states.
- have you seen the long long list of health and medical organizations who oppose this bill?  It's a disaster in so many ways
Are you willing to be covered under GCHJ?  The WI people's health should not be something that states (laboratories) experiment on.
Again ur wrong. We r in charge of health care we can't afford. Pay attention to something other than your wallet. #VoteNoGrahamCassidy
Ron, please point out where in the constitution the federal government has this authority. Then sit down and shut up. Repeal, no replace.
You have 69,000followers and 69likes on this TwitterPost. That should tell you that your constituents don't want their HC TAKEN BY YOUR Prop
Instead of making healthcare worse, how about you advocate for help to the US citizens in #PuertoRico
A YES vote is a victory for your donors.  It's a loss for the rest of us.
A "yes" vote on your lousy bill forces 50 states to create their own unique health care system within 2 years. Insanity.
I'm so glad I moved so you don't represent me anymore. Did has the biggest group of idiots in gov't.
Vote NO!!!!
No. The time has arrived for medical care for ALL. No more insurance companies,   corporations, or pharmaceutical companies deciding #wakeUp
That is absolute nonsense and you know it. Quit lying and actually represent the American people instead of your partisan, party line.
Major relevant organizations and majority of Americans are opposed to this "health care" bill / tax cut for the rich
4 rich guys w taxpayer paid ins have planw that 99% of med & ins orgs say is beyond horrible & push us to back them. U Give up ur ACA 1st
No you'll be giving power to the states & back to the insurance companies  who never looked out for the people before so why now
By taking away their healthcare? By removing pre-existing condition protections? By ending Medicaid expansion? By ignoring CBO? Puhlease.
full repeal or no deal #TeamNegativeForce
This constituent STRONGLY DISAGREES
no
Bullshit.
No. As a Wisconsin voter I am 100% against this bill and disagree with everything you wrote in your tweet. Vote NO!
A YES vote is exactly want you said, but is not a health care reform for . It is a political victory, my son's live is not cover.
And Gov Walker and assembly have no knowledge about how to handle healthcare. WI residents die.
In a high uninsured state #Texas already cutting Children's Medicaid funding .. #SinglePayer w/ #Cannabis @FDAfood plants are food we know
Perhaps a victory for federalism but a loss for actual citizens. Evidenced by the condemnation by virtually ALL medical associations.
I bet you're giving up your taxpayer funded healthcare as part of this bill, am I right, Senator Integrity?
Yep need to all vote on this bill. @SenJohnMcCain  and @RandPaulSenate  needs to get behind the bill. Repeal first. Change later.
Uh . . . A YES vote on GCHJ kills lots of people.
That is a lie and you know it. This bill will TAKE INSURANCE away from 30mill. americans including our most vulnerable.
Why don't you just take these 41000 people out & just Shoot them it would save a lot of suffering RJ
a YES vote on GC will guarantee single payer within the next ten years. Guaranteed.
I don't trust my state (the state you represent) with a block grant, to be brutally honest. No guarantee it'll be spent on health care.
LIAR!!!
I don't trust Walker with my healthcare.  Look what he's down with our education system
Keeping a bad promise that harms ppl is worse than breaking the promise. Maybe these words are meaningless to you, but I have to have hope.
If true, why is every major American medical group against it? The groups that know healthcare say you're wrong.
A YES vote will devastate your constituents...think about that instead of your party line
Bankruptcy due to health issues could lead to being a public charge.
Hasn't WI traditionally been pro-business/pro-ins. companies over its people? Lots of heart disease, diabetes, etc. health issues in WI.
Wrong
Ha  I never support this bill.
No Ron, you betrayed us .. voting yes favors insurance companies - start working for the people not your failed party. I regret voting for U
#FRAUD
4. Don't take any Medicaid coverage away from low income families, kids w/ disabilities. 5. No cuts to Medicare--that's anyone over 65 yrs.
3. Include essential benefits: prescriptions, labs, prenatal, post care, mental health, ambulances, rehab, emergency and hospital stays.
Are we the United States of America or not?  Why shouldn’t the federal government make sure that all people get the same healthcare?
1. Your voice mbox is full. 2. Guarantee WI folks w/ preexisting conditions won't pay more or will be denied coverage or capped.
no victory for anyone who has a pre-existing condition or will one day develop one, ie. all of us. Except maybe very wealthy
A yes vote is going to put your job on the line.
Kicking millions off insurance and denying coverage for essential health benefits is a funny way to define "victory." #GrahamCasiddy
With no public hearings?  And no CBO score?  You're ridiculous.
What about the people with disabilities and low income old people?
A Yes vote is the vote to kill those that are less fortunate and can not afford the type of insurance you're pushing. We pray for you sir.
Is this the reason you want to shove it through w/ a CBO report?
Fake news.
Greedy liar. #shame
I disagree, sir. If anything it washes the hands of official Washington from having to be responsible for their lack of leadership.
Dude, your reelection is in so much trouble....

how much $ were you paid for you killer vote!?
We have no protection against increased premiums for pre -existing conditions.  Plan is only 10 year plan. No essential benefits
Wrong. A victory for Federalism would mean the $ would not leave the states: this still taxes and recirculates.
Maybe if you and your cohorts had to live with the same coverage, you’d sing a different tune.
You're a sick man.

That's a lot of BS.  When r Republicans come to their senses  and work for the people.  Not for your pockets or the Lobbyist.
Senator, Are you pro-life? Because this bill is not pro-life. More abortions because women won’t be able to afford costly maternity care.
