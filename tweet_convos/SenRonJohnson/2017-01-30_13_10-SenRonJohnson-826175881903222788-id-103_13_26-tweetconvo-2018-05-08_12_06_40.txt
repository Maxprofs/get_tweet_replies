Lots of constituent calls today (& last week) on @SenRonJohnson turning off his #DC office phones. This is a disturbing/ongoing trend. (1/3)
Shame on you turning off yr phones! @washingtonpost checked this out Jan 31st & got a fast busy (ph# not reachable!) then VM
Senator, please hold up all the nominations until Bannon is out.
Bannon is a dangerous man with an extremely myopic view, no on NSC. Put country before party, say no.
I did talk to a lovely person in the MKE office. She didn't know how you were going to vote on anything. #presidentbannon
I wasn't able to get through. Many times over the course of about three days..... I'll be trying some more tomorrow.
I called eight times last week and each call went unanswered and was sent to a full voicemail box. That requires explanation.
Not being answered today and one of your staffers telling my two days ago you have nothing to do with confirmations.
On and off.  No call back - but I only asked for a call if you plan to vote Yes to Devos, so I assume you will vote NO - TY!
I'm calling and phones are busy. Will keep trying. #recindthemuslimban also pls vote against DeVos.
ummmmmm no they don't
not a majority, and polled by a non-biased entity
see:evaluations of accuracy and performance https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports â€¦ that's wtf I'm talking about
Bannon is a dangerous man with an extremely myopic view, he has no business being on a NSC. Put country before party, say no.
We need school choice. All children deserve a chance. Vote yes for DeVos.
I just called your Milwaukee office and no one picked up. Hopefully, my message will be returned promptly.
I've called your DC & MKE daily offices since 1-27. I've ONLY gotten full vm msgs. @SenatorBaldwin & @RepGwenMoore answered!
NO your phones are NOT on!  I and 6 others have gotten "Unable to leave a message" twice each. Chicken.
No on #devos
oh really?  Not able to get thru. u dont even send form reply to emails, ur staff must not read. Dont forget who ur bosses r.
Really? Then why am I repeatedly disconnected while calling your offices? No answer, no voicemail, nothing. @RepGwenMoore
Hey Ron, I'm a WI voter and have called twice to say vote NOOOO for DeVos.  Unqualified in every way!
WRONG. Can't get through.
I tried 7 times yesterday and 2x this morning. Busy w/full mailbox.
According to the Washington Post, this is less than 100% true.
Let's start with the confirmation of Betsy DeVos.  She does not represent WI education values.  VOTE NO
@RepGwenMoore  LISTEN to us Wisconsinites. You are supposed to be representing US!!  Vote NO to DeVos!
I tried to call and didn't get through. Please vote NO on DeVoss. She's unqualified.
Tried for about 20 minutes yesterday, voicemail full, nary an answer. Do not confirm @BetsyDeVos
@RepGwenMoore called this morning. Couldn't get thru us Capitol line or mke office. Sent fax instead.
impossible to get through. Been trying for a week. VOTE NO on #JeffSessions. Please.
I must have called 20 times only to get a full VM.
I've been trying all morning and still can't get through to either office. It's getting harder to take you at your word.
Answer your phone!!!!! Vote no to DeVos. A religious test does not make America safe.
@RepGwenMoore  I just tried to call, voice mail is full, unable to voice concerns. I oppose the appointment of Bannon for NSC
Liar. I called your DC and Milwaukee offices at 8am, and again at noon: "Ring-click." Managed to leave a message w/ Oshkosh
@RepGwenMoore  I call FOUL, Mr. Johnson! I've tried and can't get even leave you a message. Hopefully you're checking email!
@RepGwenMoore I couldn't get through locally but talked to D.C.  Please protect America and stand up to Trump!!
@jasonmdstein @RepGwenMoore @SenRonJohnson is NOT taking calls.
@RepGwenMoore My wife called today, DC line says it's Oshkosh office, voicemail is full. Answer calls, listen to WI voters.
weird how you have time to snipe at @RepGwenMoore on twitter but not make a statement about your prez's #muslimban
Exactly!
@RepGwenMoore by the way I live in Manitowoc county so I am an actual true real person that lives in his district
@RepGwenMoore I just tried to email Ron Johnson from this link &was denied undergoing "routine maintenance" so Ron is lying
Senator Johnson, start listening to your constituents.  Turn on your phones.- you work for us.
I've been emailing today! I hope you are listening to all your constituents
What's your stance on the #MuslimBan?
@RepGwenMoore Please vote NO on DeVos. We can do (and expect!) better!
voicemailboxes are full.  Pls vote NO to DeVos.  What is your stand on the Muslim ban? - a concerned Wisco voter!
@RepGwenMoore I only got a busy signal today. Did ur folks take the phones off the hook? I tried DC, Milwaukee and Oshkosh .
What's the answer Ron:If there were ever a red line for Republicans, Trump crossed it Friday. Or not.
I have called and haven't gotten through. I've emailed as well.
I call you every day...today just ringing and ringing and ringing w no message.
Phones are NOT on and/or UNanswered.  Vote NO on Sessions.  We're heading for civil war. Stop the #NarcissistInChief
when I called yesterday and this morning voicemail was full
I called you, no voicemail, just unanswered line.
WI voter here, Please vote against DeVos for secretary of Education, publicly oppose her, and sway fellow (R) Senators.
@RepGwenMoore I also have been unable to get through on phone lines. I will try again tomorrow. #UnhappyConstituent
Called DC office, got Oshkosh, mailbox is full. Time to call some staffers in to start listening to voicemails! #nobannowall
If you struggle to empathize with refugees, try think of them as former fetuses #NoBanNoWall
In other news, Johnson takes time to comment on his phone lines, but not on Trump's lockout of legal American residents
@RepGwenMoore Thank you, Rep Moore. Phone lines were busy for us also
Tried calling earlier today. Could not get through to all offices. Funny huh?
Yes. We did email Senator Johnsons office today. Awaiting a response. We know it's a busy day.
then why don't you come out against Trump's policies so that we don't have to call you?
.@SenRonJohnson - your phones are on but you can't make a statement on #MuslimBan ? Coward.
since you won't answer the phone or reply to emails: oppose cabinet noms, oppose the immigration ban, support the ACA.
tried to call your D.C. Office just now and the voicemail was full.
I hope you are for @POTUS Agenda/I know you are not running again/but you better do right for WI/get those Cabinets going
: Please speak out against POTUS's executive order on immigration! It's unAmerican and dangerous to the whole world.
Is that an "alternative fact"? I cannot get through to your DC office today. Was unable to leave message three days ago.
I have called many times in recent weeks and only get voice mailboxes. Often they are full.
I left a message this morning after no answer during office hours. Called now and was greeted by a full voicemail inbox.
Your silence on the Exec Order on refugees/immigrants is unacceptable
@RepGwenMoore Doesn't matter if they're on if a vm can't be left.  With this Prez  you better hire more staff to field calls
Cannot get through no matter how many times I call. Listen to your constituents who need you to protect their constitution.
http://faxzero.com/fax_senate/97  Fax him.
Staff were very polite in person. Seemed a little eager to get rid of me though.
Family after me dropping off their letters. Seem a little more willing to talk to them.
The next person after me also has a letter. Maybe the way to reach @SenRonJohnson is in writing.
Just keep your head down until after the impeachment. You might not go down with him, just stay quiet. #Ratsoffasinkingship
I emailed 12 days ago with straightforward question re: ACA position. Did not even receive autoresponse.
@RepGwenMoore YOU are ONLY here for the ones that have #paytoplay right??? Or JUST GOP Wisconsinites right?  YOU #COWARD
Liar.
Your voicemail is full.
.@SenRonJohnson I just called all 3 of your offices, and the D.C. & MKE offices disconnect automatically. Oshkosh let me leave a voicemail
.@SenRonJohnson why are there no people answering your phones, and why can't I leave a message on at your D.C. or MKE offices? #StopSessions
is this another alternate fact???
oppose DeVos. Denounce Trump's Muslim ban. Give us your public stance in general, rather than amorphous and useless updates.
Answer your Phone! Vote No on Devos!
@RepGwenMoore I just tried to call, phones are on, but nobody answers and you cannot leave a message
that is what I found as well
DC and Milwaukee offices don't even go to voicemail. Oshkosh office at least rings and accepts voicemail.
how about you take a stance on the Executive Order on immigration? Your constituents deserve to know where you stand
You're wrong, dude.
so he should make a public statement about it, he answers to all of Wisconsin
he chairs the Senate's committee on Homeland Security. This has a direct impact on that job
and it's the major news story of the last 4 days. He should just say something
Quick question: when/where is your next town hall meeting? Not seeing it on your Senate website.
.@SenRonJohnson What's your position on the president's executive order?
I called all three numbers and they were not working or went direct to vm. The D.C. # disconnects automatically
I am a constituent and haven't gotten through.
Obviously, your phone is ringing off the hook from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump supporters. We still support him. MAGA
@RepGwenMoore Maybe they are back on now, but they certainly weren't earlier. I was one who tried.
I tried, too. You are right, they weren't answering.
I'm a constituent from WF Bay and I got a full mailbox at each office this AM. Also never spoken w/ person when calling.
Haven't gotten thru. WI resident wanting your pushback on Bannon & refugee bans.  Won't make us safe and corrupts our ideals
Probably because you can't read very well, friendo.
Oppose Betsy.  Oppose Betsy.  Oppose Betsy.
Do your children attend public school?  I guess yes, so this is a mistake.
