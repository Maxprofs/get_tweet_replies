Can you just go to jail?
No but Donny will... and soon.
#ReleaseTheVideo #QAnon #HRCVideo These people are SICK.
Yes and the sooner they are out of power the better we will all be. I’m guessing you haven’t clued in yet through.
Hahahaha!  YOU are the one who hasn’t “Q”’d in yet!!  #MAGA #TheStormHasArrived  Your queen will hang....  #ReleaseTheVideo #HRCVideo @realDonaldTrump #QAnon @qanonposts
Oh dear. I’m guessing they don’t have TV and possibly even brains where you come from. #MuellerTime

Ah, the blind following the stupid.
Hillary your not relevant anymore, all your here for is to cause division.  We’re not having it sweetie.  Go back to checking up on your husband, I’m sure he’s found another playmate you can blame for something other than your own shortcomings.   Ha ha ha. Lol.
If you don’t feel she’s relevant to YOUR interests then feel free not to follow her, otherwise you’RE just being a nasty harasser and have been reported as such.  So either shut the hell up, or at least take the time to figure out that YOU’RE = YOU ARE, not YOUR.
You rock
About the same time you were interning for Goldwater right? Just go away already. #bernieorbust
We did bust, where've you been?
Working to make sure we don’t bust in 2020. Get the sheep in line.
Bernie’s past his sell-by date. Find someone new.
No thanks. #bernieorbust
Because Hillary's a corporate #shill. I supported @DrJillStein in the general election. @BernieSanders isn't our master, just like @HillaryClinton and the democrats aren't entitled to our support.
If King was alive today he would vote associate with you or any other Democrats because your agenda is aimed at making black community forever dependent on the government.
No he would vote republican. Even his niece said it.
His neice....who never met him....yeah...she's an authority..
MLK; NOW MORE THAN EVER.

"Born In The USA."

#BlackLivesMatter  #MLK50
Arrested while Peacefully protesting,  thats what he wanted Peace between All People  UNTIED WE STAND DIVIDED WE FALL. Trumps caused division,  people are seeing exactly what he is now and turning away from him and his Cronies, agenda take as much as possible from the people.
She didnt though....nice try...
1956 REPUBLICAN PLATFORM
* Assistance to low-income communities
* Protect Social Security
* Provide asylum for refugees
* Extend Minimum wage
* Improve unemployment benefits to cover more people
* Strengthen labor laws so workers can join unions
* Equal pay regardless of sex
Yes. Party ideas have changed. Fortunately conservatives are headed back towards the constitution which brought us the freedom liberty for prosperity and happines.. However your denial of Hillary's ability to change opinions & facts based on who she's speaking to is a bit wrong.
Oh my imagine playing fortniye with hillary and @realDonaldTrump ,trump will keep on building walls,hillary and our generation will break them down !!!! 
Thank you Hillary. You were the only candidate who stood up to the NRA. If MLK were alive, he would’ve endorsed you & campaigned for you.
Definitely wouldn’t have... stop letting the tv tell you this lady is such a great person...
Madame President, thank you for helping to keep Dr. Kings memory alive! He made many #Americans strive to live out the true nature of our creed. We are better because he lived! #MLK50
MLK WAS A pro-life Republican. His assassin was a Democrat.
Since you keep repeating this, I'll repeat my response:
Both statements are inaccurate. MLK was an advocate for reproductive rights. He won the Margaret Sanger Award, in fact. James Earl Ray was a white supremacist and was a member of the far-right National States' Rights Party.
First, knock it off with the name-calling. It does nothing to further your agenda. Second, you have no idea which party I support. Third, the Confederacy was somewhat old news by the time MLK was around. Fourth, read up. Fifth, you are now blocked for being rude and profane.
#ImStillWithHer Thank-you for everything you’ve done and continue to do, in spite of those who would belittle and tear you done. We know you’re on the side of the American ppl and have always done your best for US!
You are loved, you are appreciated and we are #StrongerTogether
*down ^^ autocorrect hates me  that and my big thumbs 
As a Chinese, we do not like Hilary, because she is too tough, and Trump will be willing to deal with us as a businessman.
Love you president
Thank you for this post @HillaryClinton, a great article
MLK WAS A pro-life Republican. His assassin was a Democrat.
....the REAL winner...
In what world?
The real one
Hahahahaha
Come on. The fact is, as painful as it my seem, she did win the popular vote. However, with the electorate...Trump won.  Can’t rewrite history.
The GOP certainly rewrote votes.
Still butthurt I see?

HILARIOUS: The Five Panel Takes Turns RIPPING Hillary After She Attacked Fox News [WATCH]

Thank you for making this day about MLK and not yourself like Bernie did. But of course you wouldn’t anyway. That’s why we picked you.
What have you and Bill ever done but take advantage of the black people. You two are such hypocrites.
Well, she recently did this...
So, Hillary visited a witch’s coven last night... the head of the Wing was on her 2008 campaign staff. #qanon 
We shall judge you by the company you keep Hillary.
@realDonaldTrump  Remember all the times @HillaryClinton made those typos and 4th grade spelling errors?...me either....#cuzshedidnt
Thank you so much for sharing this story today 
What freedoms?

Hero
If watching this does not bring a tear to your eye, I don't know what to say except maybe you are in need of a lot of prayer.
MLK WAS A pro-life Republican. His assassin was a Democrat.
Both those statements are inaccurate. MLK was an advocate for reproductive rights. He won the Margaret Sanger Award, in fact.  And James Earl Ray was a staunch white supremacist and was a member of the far-right National States' Rights Party.
Thank God for MLK 
Can someone explain to Bernie Sanders this is how you memorialize MLK Jr.
We love you, Hill  
You are an inspiration to so many of us!
Hey Crooked H! Q for you? Did you go to this coven in NYC the night you lost the election instead of giving a concession speech?

I think she left something at the witch's coven, too.
So, Hillary visited a witch’s coven last night... the head of the Wing was on her 2008 campaign staff. #qanon

@HillaryClinton He did what he did for  all of us.
Dr King’s vision for economic equality, was for all races. I hope you continue your work, in helping to unite the underprivileged from the Appalachians to the Inner  Cites to be lifted up to a more prosperous way of life. #MLK50
Thank you for saying that Carole, because yes he did. He cared about the betterment of people and his value to mankind should never be forgotten.
Tick tock tick tock tick tock HRC!  It won’t be long now.  God Bless @realDonaldTrump 
Yeah, Trump will be indicted. YAY!!!

Only 39. Too damned young to go. But the years he did have, he made the best use of them. ♡
When in God's green earth are you going to be indicted already? !
He and your former klan member mentor, Robert Byrd, would’ve gotten along swimmingly.
Thank you for sharing.
They never die who die for a noble Cause
What an uplifting story! In this hour of darkness, the US desperately needs a MLK and RFK. I'm not an American, but I hate seeing this once great country being brought to its knee by its own people: Trump and GOP
MLK WAS A pro-life Republican. His assassin was a Democrat
Both those statements are inaccurate. MLK was an advocate for reproductive rights. He won the Margaret Sanger Award, in fact.  And James Earl Ray was a staunch white supremacist and was a member of the far-right National States' Rights Party.

She won the popular vote

He better look forward as running as an independent since not even the Republicans want anything to do with him anymore.
Yes,  Republican and Democrat criminals don't want anything to do with him ....
I think you're referring to sane people. No sane person wants anything to do with Trump. The man is a complete idiot. His mass resignations prove people are distancing themselves from his immaturity and embarrassing tweets. People are tired of being an international embarrassment
The people you call "sane" are criminals , like this "sane" guy, they have destroyed your country ......
Lol don't tell me what destroyed my country. Cause I'll be honest Assad and Trump are very similar. I find it hard to believe the 35-40% who support Trump know what they are talking about.

Thank you Hillary
Your clothes don't match, I thought gays we're suppose to have fashion sense lol.
You know nothing.
Keep crying over 2016, & going to therapy of course
Big talk for someone who has to hide behind a fake account. Bye Troll.
Yea Right, poor black kids in Haiti and Chicago sure saw lots of help!!!! What a joke
Just something I noticed. The Parkland shooting in Florida happened on February 14th. Since then, there have been over 190 shootings in Chicago and 50 people shot dead.…


Funny how you gloss over the Dems and Jim Crow in the South in the 60's
Thanks Secretary Clinton
We were horrified,stunned&saddened the day MLK Jr was assassinated. A good man, working for the greater good.
Beautful story.  Thanks for sharingl
Rest in peace #MartinLutherKingJr


bad photoshop
Thank you Hillary, for being who you are & for your years of dedicated public service. You inspire millions. Viva Hillary! We love you. 
Did you type all that in your fake southern accent?
Thank you for sharing this story on a very important and tragic anniversary.
You lost
Thank you for sharing his story!

Hillary remains the only prominent Democrat boldly telling the politically incorrect truth about bigotry in America. Pathetic that liberal cowards attack her for it, at behest of media status quo. PoC cannot trust the press or any Democrat besides HRC. #Hillary2020 #AltonSterling
Never forget 
Thank you Hillary.  Today has been a solemn day.  I was there 10 yrs ago when you were there.  This is a wonderful post from you.  Thank u for lifting us all up, every day.
You again. You're a bit late to the party. I'm about ten tweets in already.
I'm so grateful that you blew it again.

Don't worry too much - Trump said that when Hillary goes to jail he will gladly show the tax returns - that most Americans won't understand anyways. It's coming!

Oh Hillary! We NEED you now more than ever.
Alveda King @alvedacking voted for @realDonaldTrump. Martin Luther King, Jr., a godly man, would've spoken out against your corruption, Hitlery. You have no right to use him for your propaganda. God is not mocked. #DeepStateGoesDown #ClintonCrimeFamily #ClintonCartel

Trying times now under this uncaring cluelessness trump, I wish you were president Hilary.
@realDonaldTrump doesn’t know this history. He was fed and given a silver platter & spoon. We miss your smarts. You were robbed the Presidency by crooked low down unpopular DJT.  You did WIN the POPULAR VOTE and you will ALWAYS be the People’s 1st Women President EVER

A great story! Cleophus is the man! 75 and still working!
2016 Debates: #Trump said Keep'em guessing, never let them know what your gonna do until you've done it.

Now: Everything #HillaryClinton said Trump would do, he's done.

Trump is so good at the strategy of surprise that theres nothing strategic or surprising about it
Thank you!  #ImAlwaysWithHillary #MadamePresident
Where were you Mrs Clinton on that night in 1968?
On NPR this a.m., I heard an audio clip from a 1968 news report on the strike that called the workers "Negro garbagemen." The reporter in the 2018 framing piece called them "African-American sanitation workers." Words matter. Respect matters.


You referred to them as super predators!
Oh, stop with the fake compassion and lies, Hillary. Martin Luther King would have been repulsed by you. The video of you praising Robert Byrd, a former KKK recruiter, shows your true colors. Please just go away.

Thank you Hillary for bringing this to our attention.
He is someone unlike @realDonaldTrump
Rest in Peace  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Fifty years later people are still attacking each other  ? When if ever will we learn  ?
Cleophus Smith was on the job Fifty years ago and is still on the job now! Wow, Give this man a Gold watch plus! Cleophus, you deserve retirement with a giant bonus!!
<3

MLK would be completely ashamed of you
@ChelseaClinton put down your mothers cell phone already.  We know who she called super predators.  Remember?
Thanks Hillary

Don’t pretend you care
Wow. Thank you for sharing this.

Thank-you! Great message!..You are the eternal first female POTUS on my mind...
Love you , Hillary ! #StillWithHer

Did you kill him? Add him to the list.... We have one if you need it!!!

Here’s a great headline, “Hilary Clinton finally accepts that she lost because it was her own fault”!

"Good morning. I’m here to give you an update on the FBI’s investigation of Secretary Clinton.
What I want to do is tell you what we're recommending, but first let me tell you what we found."
You’re a racist. “Hot sauce” “super predators”

The same people who you pay to protect you are from the same organisation that killed him all those years ago.

Wow you are such an EVIL BITCH!! can you not take the hint...NOBODY CARES WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY!! YOU ARE COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT!! So take your horrible pant suits and do yourself (and the rest of us) a favor...sit down and zip it!!
He was a Republican that’s why the dems killed him. Take a dam history lesson!
I love you mom
And where were you and Bill? At a Planned Parenthood meeting?

Will Always remember this & so should you. Teach your children & grandchildren 


I want to love this, but my heart breaks about how little we’ve accomplished in 50 years. I’m sorry Dr. King. We must do better.
We love u Hill u still rock my world and I respect your courage
Thank you for sharing this video. I appreciate it.
When Hillary gets on and tells us some great history about the past I wish u hater trolls stay off here cause we don’t need that mean trump trash on here.just trolls that are ugly mean , trumps way of life but the rest of us love life people and history .
The same fascists who killed him,  Malcolm X, Medgar Evars,  RFK and  JFK, elected Trump.  Always the fascist right using lowlife tactics to stop humanity from true freedom.
Oh Honey, ypu be 's posed to be quiet, scream now!
