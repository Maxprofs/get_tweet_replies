I find it highly interesting that this change is occurring. Trying to figure out WHAT is different this time? Is it because the kids have taken the mantle and are being heard?    If so, finally a good legacy for #Millennials
These teens have had social media for their whole lives.  In the past few years the news business has exploited social media for clickbait with their ad-based business model

But the teens have homefield advantage, and more or less a direct pipeline to modern media exposure.
I think the big difference is that their digital lives connected to mass media as it was happening

They were live tweeting and interviewing each other.
THIS  is probably the best response I’ve heard/read that makes the most sense. Reading/hearing their tweets & txt convos in real time I believe was eye opening and a slap in the face to the public. I agree whole heartedly with your reply #Millenials
This articulates it quite well: https://nyti.ms/2FNWgMI  #Enough
Wow! That is a fantastic article! Last paragraph is powerful!!! At the risk of being ‘cheesy’ it reminds me of 
#CelebrateYouth #ElectricYouth by @rickspringfield  & @DebbieGibson respectively. Gives me #Hope
Meanwhile, crickets from @Amazon and @JeffBezos
... And NRA.
I just pictured @DLoesch opening her mouth and nothing but the sound crickets make coming out of it and for the first time, I could stand her.
@TomiLahren , too. and @TuckerCarlson and the rest of those a-hole #MAGAFuckers.
Time to go buy some stuff at REI
Say HELLO to Bankruptcy REI while BASSPRO says HELLO to REI Customers
Thank you @rei! Proud to be a co op member
Thanks for the tip.  One more retailer to avoid ...
Obviously they didn’t learn from everybody else’s mistake. They to will learn a harsh lesson.

@HillaryClinton @washingtonpost   Much less expensive at Big5 and no attitude!
Yes, go REI!!
I will no longer shop at REI. They should stay out of politics. I hope they feel good about themselves as they lose loyal customers who are gun owners.
#NRA #2AShallNotBeInfringed

Don't tell the public gun crimes have gone down in the passed years even though gun sells have gone up. So what is with the public schools and gun law liberal cities u ask? The gangs and not the teacher run them. Before msm had a "hate a cop" year then did "hate a teacher"
Your business will close.
AWESOME!
Hillary, Anti-American. Good little Marxist you are. Women of America can and shoud defend themselves and their families.
Fuck REI
Globalist Liberals have taken guns away from everyone, even police, in Sweden.

1 migrant vs 4 police officers…

I'm pretty sure JFK never said the following: "ask not what your country can ban for you but what you can boycott for your country"

Well...you got some splainin to do @HillaryClinton.  Guess your life is more important than mine.  You got a big bad dude with a gun to save your a*sssss F*king elitist.
They deserve applause for this. If i were remotely and outdoorsy person, i'd purchase something right now from them
I’ll order something for myself on your behalf today! ;)
Thank you!!!!!!
I got you that tent I’ve been looking at!
nice! i hope you enjoy your tent!!!
Did that random guy just pitch a tent for you? Lol
I pitched one for the team
No longer my retailer. Thanks for the heads up.
BRING OBAMA BACK <3
So somebody can put one between the eyes
Do you suffer from PTSD?
Glad to know that. I’ll never shop there again!!
Just ordered my @CamelBak water carrier. #BoycottREI because its Board of Directors is too stupid to remain apolitical.
Maybe Dicks should worry about there customer service. It is the worst in retail!
Dude REI blows... so over priced
https://twitter.com/Hublife/status/972275875805782016 …
another Marxist
That is ridiculous
So you won't be able to buy items that have nothing to do with guns...That's so stupid.
The only people who think it's great probably never step foot in an REI, the actual customers ....not so much.
I won't be shopping at @REI any longer.
This is a HUGE decision. Giro helmets are high quality and very popular, as are CamelBak water carriers. @REI I'll try to support you any way I can!

Stupid
There are other stores.
I’m sorry with respect , I still don’t understand why? 
Shhh listen, ... can you smell that?

That's STUPID REI. I will discontinue my membership. Should be focused on releasing the #HRCVideo
Good for them
I invented the electric flame furnace. I do not need any fuel. As long as there is electricity, I can burn it infinitely. Interested can contact me, this is the YouTube flame cooker fire video address. https://youtu.be/ml_qious8mk 
i foresee dick's closing soon
Cool. I won’t be shopping at REI

THE ONLY TIME I HAVE AN URGE TO TWEET ABOUT HILLARY IS WHEN I AM TAKING A SHIT.

If I had ever shopped at REI, this would be a good reason to stop shopping with them.
I guess you won't have to worry about shopping with them then  (;
It is sad to see Corporate America bullying each other beacuse of  differences in values. Not that neither is right or wrong. But a trickle down effect to those with the spending dollars.
Funny that you oppose firearms soo much!
Thanks for the update.  I now know where not to shop.  REI will not get another dollar from me. Keep posting. I am making a list. Hurt them in the wallet.  Just ordered my CamelBak from Cabela's.

1. A NEW SC. This development heralds a brand new stormfront coming toward the Houses of Clinton & Obama.

But don't forget that there are at least NINE other major storms swirling…


Cabbellas here i come
Oh really
Good to know. No more shopping at rei
how lovely applauding people being laid off

MAGA2020
Libs are so delusional. Control is not the answer. Didn't work with Prohibition, War on Drugs etc. This concern with life is a farce. Where is their outrage over the butcherings committed daily in squeaky clean clinics? Meanwhile - Black Marketeers salivate while cheering them on
https://teespring.com/LIBERALSHAMPOO 
We don't need your cheap stuff anyway.. Keep it and pay taxes on them...
Too bad I used to like REI
That’s great they suck anyway. Not many rei stores left. cabelas and bass pro shop much better for gear and guns.
Not a problem! Another place not to shop. Easy.
Thank you for sharing! I almost order a $1,600 bike from #REI for my nephew B-day! Rediculous! Not shopping there!
Good thing, we need to stand against all those idiots.
http://www.instagram.com/goldensthoughts 
You guys DO know that those items can and WILLL be bought elsewhere...right?
REI is way over priced.  Haven’t shopped there in years!

They’re gonna loose. Doesn’t Delta prove it?
Seriously, #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Oh wow. They’re overpriced and not even a relevant company anymore.
The city of Binghamton just gave Dick's Sporting Goods 5 million dollars to build a Storage Center they pay no taxes on the materials to build it and they are tax-exempt with property and school taxes so there government ass kissers
Thankful to live in a town where there’s other options than @REI 
ROFL AT YOU DUMMIES
Never heard of REI. So happy you're not in the WH!!
Kyle you are an NRA member right ?   how much are the yearly dues ?  what do u get for being a member ?
Do they think people are thinking "gun laws" when they need to buy a camelback? Cutting off their nose to spite their face.
Rei sucks
Awesome!!!  So instead of profits going to these big chain stores, where usually you come out with more than intended, it will go to our local mom & pop shops!!  COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPIER!!!!!!!  CYA BIG BOX STORES!!!

...yeah, just deleted my REI account too.

I too like shooting myself in the foot!
She retweeted you!  Wow!
https://www.facebook.com/ray.logan.76/posts/10215767860530902 …
Thank u REI
Cool!
Won't be shopping there!
Like that will do anything. Plenty of places will sell their stuff and REI will go back to doing it when the spotlight they get for doing this fades and profits drop. #BoycottREI @REI is overpriced anyway....


Lovely keep mr

This is absurd now.

Yes!!!
I will no longer shop at you REI if this is true #ARstandsForAmericaRocks
#BoycottREI - THEY do NOT believe in the 2nd Amendment - Another UN-AMERICAN COMPANY.

I'm from across the water but will not buy camelback nor Giro. Any more for my list?
Been a member since 1972.
Not surprised at all that REI still retains true morality and outstanding integrity.
I also was an nra member before that organization lost any sense of morality and integrity. Been long gone from them for decades.
Hip - hip - hoorah
What a fucking joke.
They are still selling semi automatic rifles but they are hunting rifles. Just as deadly, magazine capacity is very close and they are available to teenagers over 18.
They just don't look all scary and shit like an ar15.
You've been duped. Hahahaha
I have an idea. You’d be great sweeping the halls of prison
Wow! @REI is looking out for our kids! Thank you!!!
No one really cares any more. This is just to make people like Kyle happy. The majority of Americans don't care...
CROOKED Hillary I hope your watching JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE!
No problem will buy there stuff at other store and stop giving any of our business to Dick’s completely!!
I love how you liberals , want to take guns to save lives? But you’re the biggest promoter of abortion the murder of defenseless lives. And how you complain about cops being out of control killing African-Americans. What do you think America Will be like when they take our guns.
I like what I'm hearing here
Wow, that will surely cut down on mass ahooting!!
한국의  #MeToo운동에 오로지 마약같은 권력에만 눈이 어두운 철저한 이기주의적 기회주의집단인 파렴치한 정치인들이 아직도 없다는 것이? 유머이나 창조주님자식인 그리스도보다 성철,김수환같은 종교지도자로서 천국에 간신히 간 요한이 더욱 나은 것은 그리스도는 세상에 또다시 내려올 수 있기에?
GOOD!! Small local business thanks you.
Those 2 weeks are almost up HRC, can you or Tony answer any questions ???
@oscarmayer @POTUS @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @kylegriffin1 @HillaryClinton Do You and Huma visit " America Favorite Burned Weiner"?  Tony First
"HILLARY and HUMA"  Next. 
@HillaryClinton has @BillClinton touched anyone improper lately? Just a Wondering. Been a While.
Why as you,? You are Obviously Clueless. Mental Instability isn't gonna Work. Or for @Comey
6million?? on social media trolls reported on @msnbc complains social media trolls are a problem??????????????? @voxdotcom
she see's people speaking up and fighting back as something negative to be dealt with.!! she out right avoids the truth.!!! will not admit mainstream media is the driving force of hate and bigotry in America @voxdotcom
she builds facts off falsely inflated facts.!! she is top looking down .. corporate perspective.! she speaks for the well off people not mass majority views or needs.!! she has no plan.. her plan is business as usual.. mediocre..! @voxdotcom FEAR based ideology.! mainstream media
Pay attention, liberals.

Guns were banned in Venezuela in 2012, & now 90% of their population lives in poverty, while the other 10% are protected by guns.

That’s how socialism works.

1. Disarm
2. Starve
3. Rob

But notice how 2 & 3 never happen unless 1 happens first.
REI, Done.
As a member I agree with the decision.
Another "virtue signalling" company ready for bankruptcy. The PR people should be fired. They are making  of themselves and destroying businesses. COMMUNISTS can't afford camping gear because they are just govt slaves. Cut off your nose to spite your face. Real smart! SMH
You realize there’s no way companies like REI want you reporting this like that?  “Assault rifles” is political language of the left. And you entirely left out their aim was just to have companies announce a plan for addressing gun violence.  Very irresponsible.
So what'sraisingthe age to 21 going to do, except chip away at law abiding citizens #2ndAmendment rights!?!?

#2ndAmendment


Good!
My hero!
https://www.consumeraffairs.com/retail/rei.html 

I was an @REI "member" but it's way overpriced and it felt like it's for people who want to look outdoorsy. If that's the route they want to take then stop selling items made at sweat shops. Oh and pay your employees a decent wage...
Breaking News REI goes bankrupt.
That's really going to stop mentally ill kids from shooting up their school?  I think not.  Stop acting childish, Dims.

Do you want to know why we Poles are so angry when we hear the phrase "Polish Camps"? 
We have millions of examples why! 
This man volunteered to go into German Nazi Camp…
Do they do Blue Dresses or Cigars...asking for a friend.
And THAT, my friends, is how the free market works. So no bitching  from RWNJ!
Great decision. It's good to see the private sector taking action where congress is too afraid to act. Those hillbillies who are happy to see our kids massacred for the sake of profit must be put out of business, once and for all.
#CrookedHillary  #HillaryRottenClinton
Another reason I love @REI
Thanks for the info. I already own a Giro helmet, which is made really well. I’ll have to look at their camp stoves and water carriers. #BoycottLiberalBoycotts #BoycottREI #BoycottHillary
REI rocks!  Thank you!


Ah...sweet victory...glorious yet FLEETING.  
Mr. McCabes situation is MOST UNFORTUNATE.
I'm sure it is all just some sort of "MISUNDERSTANDING".
His full cooperation should help to quickly resolve the "MATTER".
Amazon may need to be boycotted also.
Way to go REI!
Thank you @REI! I know where I’ll be heading before my next camping trip.
