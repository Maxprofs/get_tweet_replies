@HillaryClinton told a sold out @RutgersNB crowd that she's encouraged by the number of women who are running for office or active in politics, saying "I believe we are on the brink.” http://go.rutgers.edu/mk0ijmbr   @NationalNOW @pantsuitnation …

Snooki got more money hag. Bawaaa
On the brink, indeed...

You are a criminal Hillary, we were on the brink with Obama. You would have taken us over the edge with a smile
God bless America , God bless President Trump
Rutgers is this desperate? Or that stupid? That far left?? Woman, you are still blaming your loss on being a woman?? 

Get over yourself already!

Nice cast hahaHaHaha Loser!!!
You can always just retire from public life. That would make America great again!
#Lockherup. Not my President
#JuanitaBroaddrick #GenniferFlowers  
#MonicaLewinsky
You said no man who lost an election was told to shut up. That is because no man who has ever lost has gone on an eighteen month loser tour. By the way, rumor has it Rutgers paid Snooki $7,000 more than they paid you. Good times!
Isn’t THAT the truth!  Can’t stand a whiner 
No Hillary, We were on a brink on November 8, 2016. Thank God you lost & President Trump Won!!
Trump was installed
...by the American people.
Why don't you just realize you kost the election because you are a corrupt person. Period....

Does your advocacy for female dominance stem from being married to a serial rapist?  Serious question.
Just a reminder, Hillary!
@HillaryClinton at the @RutgersNB to a SOLD-OUT crowd:“... I believe we are on the brink.” 
YES we are, #DearHILLARY, with your guidance and leadership, we can achieve anything we want!

Thanks to you Hillary i have seen women Rise up in more numbers than ever. You empowered us . You are such an inspiration,  you lifted us up. #WearewithYou but #YouAreWithUs in every step you have paved. Thank you.
I believe you will never be president.
You're on the bring of going to prison! ha!!!! #hillaryforprison #draintheswamp
Grateful to you for being the head of the spear. Only wish it had worked out differently. You will, however. always be #MadamePresident to me. Everyone knows you really won. #ThePeoplesPresident

You’re going to jail bitch. 
Hey @HillaryClinton, #AprilFoolsDay!
No one wants you to type. No one wants you to interview. Your own party despises you. I am not telling you to go away because you are a female. I am telling you to go away because you are a horrible human and no one wants you here anymore.
#Lockherup No more Clinton Corruption #MAGA
Thank you, @HillaryClinton, for the hope and inspiration you have fostered in women for decades. You are a shining example of a dedicated public servant. If you ever come to speak near me, I will race to purchase tickets! #StillWithHer
You are delirious!
I worked around u and know who r really r nice post but we know the truth of what u really think huh

That had to have been the most deranged egotistical Rutgers speech I ever heard! I'm ashamed to call @RutgersU my alma mater  for having someone so corrupt, and soon to be a felon, give a college speech
Agreed!! What a sh*t institution #Rutgers has become to allow a lying fraud like #CrookedHillary to come on and spew more lies!!!  #LockHerUp #JeffSessions #LockHerUpAlready #ClintonCrimeFamily #clintonEmails
Hello
Civics test: what does "C" stand for when on an official government document from the State Department:  a) Clinton; b)Comey; c) Collusion; d) Classified
On the brink allright!
Come invest to peaceful Namibia, Africa.
I'm not a Big Fan of HRC but thats how our democracy is setup to work ! I listen to your side & then you listen to my side then see what we can workout to make things better for All the American People starting with the least among us !
@Hillary Clinton, comments below belong in the “childish sticks & stones” category.  Not a one could hold a candle to you, thus, incapable of intellectual expression, only personal attack’s.  How can that be when not one of the commenters knows u personally.
Nobody has more reason to be angry at Comey that Hillary, but I'd bet she would vouch for his character over any of the clowns in the Administration or on Fox News that are disparaging him.
Brilliant point. Still messed up though. 



Go back into the woods you old bat. No one cares what you have to say or believes one word.  Cannot wait for you to be hauled off to jail.
Thank you Hillary for volunteering your entire life to helping others. You are my hero.

Hola

Hillary might be on the brink of going to prison
Killary will never win anything
Picking ur brain does not allow the invite for taking what is perceived as a dead intention an using ur perseception as involvement of history as we all acknowledge it repeats it again the greatest moment in memories is God in the creation of God as God so it is repeating history
Too bad you invited a serial liar and leader of the hate game in present American politics.  RU has forever lost my alumni $upport money after this "featured" speaker.  Condi Rice not welcome at Rutgers but Snooki and Clinton are paid to show up? Disgraceful, epic bad judgement!
You’re on the brink of losing the little bit or Chardonnay infused brain cells you have left! Go away!
Corruption  at its highest level.. I'll join up how much  can I make
The only thing you are on the brink of is Gitmo
you need to #gitmo time to tweet, I noticed they fell off, I hope the things that #qanon are saying about you is a #whitchhunt to arrest #bigpharma and the #deepstate, i hope history shows you to be a undercover #patriot who distracted the bad guys, but i dont think so
Epstien Island probably has horrible cell reception. #LockHerUp #GitmoStudioApartments
Apparently they had phones installed so no worries.
#HolocaustRemembranceDay Andrew McGregor and I agree with @rachelbtiven
We welcome more women... we just don't want YOU! 
Here's a view of the crowd who went to see Hillary
If anyone is crying it is the liberals who are worried about not getting handouts anymore.
Good one you probably think I live in a trail park in the south! I live in the most liberal state (CA), area (Bay Area), and city which I will not say. Now I’m guessing your parents say they work, when in reality (which you never live in), they are wasted at the bar!

Why is your speaking fee 10% of what it was when you were paid for your “influence” (back when you thought there was NO WAY you could lose to Trump).... ???
Hillary I am excited about the many conservative women entering politics as well!
#FullOfShit
We still love y'all Hillary!
There are multiple Hillary’s??? I sure hope not one is already too much
There's only the one Hillary that gets by on that! Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. She's one of the best ever!!!!
Did Rob Rosenstein convince Jess Sessions to recuse himself from the Russian Collusion investigation.   I believe he did, and Sessions didn’t know enough to refuse him!
HRC The People’s Choice
Yes I watched it. Joke!
U were fantastic at this Event! I wish U had better people in ur Campaign in 2016- they did not communicate your message. You were crystal clear @ Rutgers event & the College Students were all behind you. U should be POTUS now! @cspan @RobbyMook u were a "fail" 4 HRC.
I believe a woman could be elected president but most certainly VP in 2020 and I believe a woman WILL be elected president in 2024.
just got to sit and watch this. Thank you so much. I'm angry,I'm active and sad. Cried through most of this.. #StillWithHer
There is more than one way to lead a nation. Still With Her.
I love You Hillary

Booooooo to Rutgers and all the students who came out to see what all the fuss was about. Nothing to see here. Move along.
Who cares what you say or think!

Im so jealous, by the time I knew u were going to be there, it was sold out!
you belong in PRISON !
And you got paid less than Snooki!
We're on the "Brink" because you underestimated the power of "The Undesirables" (I simply call them white trash) to mass, organize, vote.
Shouldn’t feel happy for another year.
Go HILLARY LOVE YOU! I am retiring from Facebook for a while who got us in this horrible situation with a rapist and drug attic in the WHITEHOUSE!!
"I don’t think it's a coincidence that at the same time, we are witnessing an all-out attack on core values of democracy: free speech and the rule of law." Absolutely laughable, considering the source.

Stay away from politcs..u failed face it
#LockHerUp

Yes thanks to @POTUS we are on the brink of GREATNESS! And you are on the brink of living the rest of your life in a jail cell. #TICKTOCK
shoulda locked you up.
#MyPresident! @HillaryClinton, First woman elected by Popular Vote to the Presidency of the United States of America! Never forget that #Russia and the #GOP conspired to deprive her of an Electoral College win!  #NeverAgain! #BlueTsunami #BlueTsunami2018 #MadamPresident!
Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up, Lock her up,
Hopefully they learned from your mistakes as you continue to be an embarrassment

OMG will she never go away?? Get the hint Hillary...You lost. The American people don't care about you or your thoughts. You are a trailer and a liar.

Somebody's certainly sounding like she's on the brink.

Impeached by fox news?  You need to find a new shrink and a new dosage.
Snookie 7K more.
you're such a loser and you're going down. hope the goverment tourtures you in GITMO for your crimes against the Citizens of the Federal Republic of the United States of America.
#fuckNWO
You lost the election because you were a shitty candidate.  And the worst president in history (Obama)endorsed you. Please stop blaming everyone and take some responsibility
Another woman will do what you could not do. It will happen. Yours is always going to be a story about “the other woman.”
Thank you for continue to share you knowledge and wisdom! You have so much damn energy.. please share your vitamin/eating routine! I need some of what you take! @hillaryclinton
Yep- you are on the brink of going to jail. 
YES! ...and not soon enough! They shd have locked you up years ago Hillary!!!!
LOCK HER UP
I can’t wait to see you on a 24 hour cspan camera of you in your cell at GITMO
You are delusional.  Heard you once again today thinking you are relevant.  Your not.
You can't be impeached because you're not President and you never will be. Epic fail on your part.
You
when is it going to be the easter bunny's fault for losing the election? you have used just about every other excuse except for the fact that you were a horrible candidate!
We’re on the brink of sick of listening to your whining and crap
Burn in hell!!!!
But still a loser

We survived 8 long , hard , awful years under Obama trying to turn our nation into communists. You'll survive Trump. Believe me we hated Obama.
The greatest President ever ..........
On the brink is an understatement thanks to you and previous administrations. We are in the biblical battle between Jesus Christ and the likes of you. Charles Ortel, Q Anon, Craig Sawyer, Judicial Watch...Etc. are on your tail. Repent and pray and he will forgive. Come clean.
Disgusting you advertise yourself as a  "savior" for women.  You were in politics for yourself, nothing more.

Love you. Love your message, intelligence, and encouragement. Thank you

@RutgersU_News
@RutgersNB
They are coming for you killary! #TimeIsNow #LockThemAllUp
Why don't stay home and stop wasting our tax dollars on your trips.  You've stolen enough from us.
Stop bashing, you're looking like a fool. You don't represent me as a woman.  Please seek help, you're still not dealing with the election.
Yo Hillary, thank you for being you
Did you discuss narcissistic loony tunes? Did you have a discussion about rapists?
..or were you not that thoughtful?
Bernie draws a bigger crowd than you, you old hag.
But several embattled warrior-women led the way through the thicket. We are forever in your debt! To pay the debt...we all need to walk the walk.
您现在是什么职务
Hillary you are the greatest we love u and we hope some day you serve us againg anyway you can
Why is Epstein spending $29mm to bury the tunnels underneath is temple on Epstein Island? 
Problem.
Phones were allowed in.
These people are stupid.
Q
Go away
Thank God, POTUS Trump won the election by a landslide
But we would love to see you "walk" again in 2020

#Trump1 he is POTUS and hilliary aint!
You're on the brink alright
You will never break the glass ceiling...because you are always falling down!!   Lol
Please stand down and support the young democratic hopefuls that I have a chance to change this country.
How much did they have to pay you??? Get real!!!
blind guy wanders in.... mutters to himself....godammit, how do I keep ending up at the wharf.
