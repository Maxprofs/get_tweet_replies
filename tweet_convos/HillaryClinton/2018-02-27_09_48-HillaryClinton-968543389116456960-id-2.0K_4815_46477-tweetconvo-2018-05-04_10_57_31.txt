Alumna @HillaryClinton ’73 J.D. will be this year’s Class Day speaker  http://bit.ly/2CLYPLS  #YaleAlumni @YaleLawSch
So much #WINNING! We’re fighting for YOU Hillary! We DID VOTE! 
A snowflake with no hope.
Nice.
We will never stop fighting for you Hillary. We miss you
Congrats!! See if you would have won d 2016 prez election no way would you have been able to fit this in your daily schedule right? Just look at how busy d current POTUS is w/d #MuellerInvestigation & we know d @GOP majority would have you also in #investigations!!
Hillary  $$ created the unfound Mueller investigation.#corruptHillary
#BlueTsunami2018 #BlueWave2018 - #TheResistance is coming HARD and we’re taking this county back! 
That's the funniest thing I have read all day.

@Yale @YaleLawSch
I wish I could attend - I graduated last year, and can't make it this year since I am carrying on your legacy of strong women working at the State Department!
@PhilippeReines she's using emojis again. How I live for it! 
Please don’t encourage her or you’ll see 280 of them in a row.
I’m encouraging her.
STOP

Me too! I mean she is our Madam President!  #ForeverWithHer
What is included in this chain that is tipping off the trolls & bots?
The only thing is can see is my hashtag of #ForeverWithHer  I think she's still such a really big threat to them. She is our legitimate President after all 
Picking a criminal that should have been disbarred 30+ years ago is simply appalling and shows that institue has no morals or ethics!
Love Hillary she makes us proud .
Proud that we have Trump and not corrupt Hillary.  Damn proud!
Liberal Dem. college. Ivy league no nothings.
Go away please.
Sorry you got election stolen from u

#williamcampbell is talking
and how much is she charging to lie to the students

Fun for them, and for you!
@HillaryClinton plz follow back cuz that will make my day
Bet they are too.
What are you talking about? Stealing from your country, lying to Congress, keeping your husbands pants zipped up, just what do you think you can offer?
Angry nasty guy why don’t you say theses things about trump .
Because Trump's lemmings have drunk gallons of the kool-aide he's dished out.  Many of my Christian friends just can't see how much they've compromised their religious beliefs to support that man!

No worries. Luckily for you trump supporters and higher education don't mix.

Lol - sucks to be you Vanessa - the right person won!!!    TRUMP2020
HRC won the majority votes from the People of the United States of America!
If it wasn’t for Russia, HRC would be POTUS. Surely you can’t be an American. A foreign country rigging an election is ok? I really want to see the pee tape Putin has. It must be pretty good
Topic: How to make millions through Russian collusion, and not go to jail.
I believe you are talking about trump .
You're likely the only one.
...unless coughing-fit enthusiasts and/or sheep are present.
So hard faced... horrible woman!! So false!!
Hope she gets arrested that day Hillary Clinton belongs in jail

The thought of you excited just depresses the hell out of me.

Go to jail already.

#QAnon
enjoy your last few speeches outside our prison system

Globalist Liberals have taken guns away from everyone, even police, in Sweden.

1 migrant vs 4 police officers…
Kathy Griffin was unavailable!!!!
Hello dear

NOT IF YOU GO TO JAIL FIRST....YOU SHOULDN'T BE EXCITED ABOUT ANYTHING WOMAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN A TRAITOR TO OUR COUNTRY. GO TO JAIL.
@HillaryClinton
Here's some talking points for you! @POTUS #MAGA #GreatAwakening #QAnon #8Chan #4Chan
...what's with the bogus popular vote count for Hillary in the first meme? You know that she won the popular vote, right?
She lost bigly
No, she lost barely.
Keep telling yourself that. She still lost.
No, the country lost.  Hopefully this year we will begin repairing the damage done but that toad and his minions
Madam President.
she lost. it really is over.


Corrupt,crooked,evil Hillary is back to playing dangerous dirty games?
Love Hillary

@paigejlaw IM SO JEALOUS AGGH

Want #guncontrol Join #AntiwarMovement! i.e. strike the root cause of the disaster profiteer economy whose side effect you suffer #TheUnitedStatesOfDespotica

#YourStillHere
How could we expect anything less of a brilliant classy professional woman Congratulations!!! We love you Hillary R Clinton...all including the 3 million more votes than Donald J tRump
she is still a two time Presidential loser.


... And I Just can't hide it!
We’ll see said the blind man!
We need political equality. It is wrong for our Ivy league schools to be sorting people based on political ideology. Conservative teachers are being suppressed.
Congratulations!

Back in your cave Bat 
Hope it’s televised! We need to continue to “hear” you! #45HRC
Looks like the face Bill has when he buys cigars bahahahahaha
#StillWithHer
#StillWithHer  you better believe it!
TRUMP is Hillary Clinton's PRESIDENT!
And he’s just as bad as she said he would be.
Ha Ha Ha ! Great Again !!
Yeah.  Thrilling.  A college renamed after a criminal.

Gracias me gusta.
You are awsome.
I am so with you and now the American people and the rest of the world realizes the impact of not having you as President!!!  Continue to tell your truth because it was OH so true!!  GOD bless you!!!
It is a blessing Hillary is not President!  Trump 2020!
Please use this as an opportunity to look forward, not backward.  I supported you and voted for you, but please no more rehashing the 2016 election.  We need to focus on 2018 and 2020 to end the scourge of the @realDonaldTrump administration.
MAGA TRUMP 2020
@Yale @YaleLawSch 

Your are THE BEST #HillaryClinton AND WE LOVE YOU ENDLESSLY!

#AlwaysWithHer #thePEOPLESpresident

They are extremely lucky, Madam President!

That would be the president of nothing
The #Bot of nothing... 
#TwitterLockOut @Twitter @twittersecurity

Congratulations Madame President.
You might hurt her feelings.
Plus the presidency doesn't give trophies to L O S E R S

I encourage her to use all the emojis she wants! Actually, She can say anything she wants as far as I'm concerned.
Can she say I lied about Benghazi?
They are so lucky to be graced with a speech by you! I saw you speak in 2008 - it was wonderful! You were my hero then, and still are 



Let me guess, is the title of your speech, 
“How I lied to America for years”
“ How to commit TREASON and pretend it’s not happening”
“I lost, Deal with it”  “ How I cheated my ass off, AND STILL LOST The Election“
Yay!!!
You go girl

.........madame president.......
My girl is going to Yale!!!! Soo proud!!!
Y'all cam say what you want about Hillary but if she was a man, she'd be in the WH. Men don't want to see a  as POTUS!!
That’s right, we all need to support @nikkihaley in 2020
Wowww... SUPER BEAUTIFUL Estimated Madam President Hillary Clinton *you are UNIQUE TRUTH LEADER *
I am a retired paralegal. I am glued to MSNBC! I told myself last Fri?that I knew you, Barrack, as well as Eric Holder were celebrating 

I knew I should have gone to Yale. 
'THEY LIKE ME!!  THEY LIKE ME!!'
How much are they paying you?

Congrats.., you are OUR LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT!  Trump cheated I hope the judges award you the Presidency
Wow. Totally disagree. She is the cheater. Rigged primary against Bernie, used her foundation to line her pockets, paid for information to try to illegally take down Trump. Not to mention the 50+ other scandals that prove her corruption.
Be sure to mention being an extreme criminal and horrid person at Alumni celebrations.
Go away now please

A thief, cheat and constant liar. Exactly what higher education needs. Way to go. Oh don’t forget Benghazi.
She's so excited to explain why she failed the election.
1 @HillaryClinton post = over 100 bot blocks!!!! 
Plz stop syrian children killing 
I know you have heart.....
Who will fill in if you’re in jail?
Bot.
So great. Wish I was a student.  #stillwithHer
How many lies will she say, and how many times will she tell them “What Happen” What a joke.
Congratulations!  Make it a great one!
How is this woman still free?
Cheer up!
bet that gig pays well
#Congratulations
I hope you're not disappointed. They may have her locked up by then. The clock is ticking on a lot of wrongdoings by her. #MAGA , #DrainTheSwamp
@adrienneelrod @Yale @YaleLawSch
All you have to do is look at the number of their “likes” and the number of ours. We’re comin for you, so enjoy your madness while it lasts.
You are proof what one can achieve through diligence and hard work. Kudos to you Hillary!! I am suitably impressed.
Excited?
You are so done and going to jail.
Are u only happy when people applaud you? Go volunteer somewhere and work like real people. Just stay away from money and children.
do you have to pay them to attend?

Tune in to #OANN Saturday (July 30th) and Sunday (July 31st) at 5pmET for @ClintonCashFilm. 
Yeah, doesn't take much, does it?
Way to go, Hillary!  I so wish I could be a Yale graduate right now.
*when check clears
WHAT'S. THAT. SMELL. ????????????

you still here? thought you were in hiding again.
I’m excited too: can’t wait to see you in prison orange pant suit.
Hillary Clinton is among the wisest and gracious leading woman of our era . May the hope of the future be great on her .
Good for you!  Congrats!
Maybe your parole officer can get you a three day pass that day so you can go? How’s the fitting on the ankle bracelet? Color match your pant suit? Hey orange is the new black!
Our rightful president & a wonderful speaker.
Synergy u can speak to your kindegarddn class, what a trajectory, the your fellow inmates
I am thrilled with my alma mater’s choice. Wish I could be there to hear you speak.
A Lib speaking to Libs... what's new?
How much $ is going to the Clinton Cartel from this boondoggle?
They are so lucky 
You go girl!!!!!!!
Their parents did not donate a lot of money to Yale...they are very intelligent.  That's all.
that's great
Well there’s one excited person. The rest are dreading the excruciating boredom and tired bs. Why don’t you tell them all why you lost.(zzzzzzz) and all about how “pro woman” you are. Just have audience screened for bullshit detectors or they’ll be so noisy you’ll be drowned out.
Way to go Hillary ! Congrats ! 

@Yale @YaleLawSch I think I am understood in France.
Shouldn’t you be preparing for the military tribunal.
So Bill finally got an erection for you?
How are you going to get through this one without hacking up a lung? What a joke
I would burn my diploma

Congratulations bet you can't wait to return to your alma mater

"To all the little girls watching...never doubt that you are valuable and powerful & deserving of every chance & opportunity in the world."
Lead balloon, wonder if you will be able

Congratulations Mrs. Clinton. I wish this Presidential  election wasn't stolen from you by Russians and Trump.
wow that's wonderful
Are you going to release the transcripts this time?
You are going to prison. I am excited to
Great day for Yale students to skip school! I’m not a fan of truancy but in this case, well, Yale students, sleep in, go shopping, just skip listening to this hypocritical, greedy, selfish, lying, crooked bitch!
Go away
You are very beautiful
Congratulations!
How do you sleep at night?
Perfect choice
Uh oh, don't fall on your face again in  public.
Yea excited to steel more money from these Sheep
Congrats!
you deserve all good things. enjoy! wish i could go!
#StillWithHer
Seriously Yale you could have done much better!
What lies & bullshit is she going spill out of her mouth! Yale should cancel her speech & get someone more intelligent  that could give the students something worthwhile for their future 
My Yale friends are so excited and trying to figure a way to get to attend. What an honor for the Class of '18!!

Can you come to @XavierUniv ?
WTF I still can't get out if bed since Nov 2016
Congratulations HRC ! 
I always haw been yearning for Hillary elements. .How shall I describe it.. I might be a work of mixture myself i sense or hybrid if ya will. .I'm not as pure or monolithic enough. .i dunno. This spiritual savoring is hard to be persuasive ..What words should i put. .
Speaking to a room full of suckers.
Gonna talk about how you recovered from your trauma at getting shot at in Bosnia?
You're so crooked.
Please Mrs Clinton, please check out this link for me and support and share, this is real and I am afraid of the future
https://www.gofundme.com/single-father-fresh-out-of-surgery …

I’m so board! Where the bathroom Hillary is speaking again.
Make sure to discuss #ElectionFraud #ElectionTampering and #Racism
Is it possible to get a ticket? You inspire, and are an incredible speaker. Cheers!!
Figures that you would go to college and still. They are the only places that you are like because people have brainwashed our youth into thinking dictatorship and liberalism are good. Once they reach the real world, they become Republicans!
最近身体还好吗，问候克林顿先生！祝你们身体健康！
You can teach them how to be a criminal.

Why??? Oh!!! You’re getting new bracelets!!
Enjoy yourself, Madam Secretary!!!
Gonna be hard to give a speech from Gitmo. I doubt they’ll let you stream it.
It must be absolutely soul crushing when @HillaryClinton wakes up every morning
Great for you Hill, you don’t have much on your plate these days.
