Women are running for office in record numbers.

Yet women - especially women of color - continue to face enormous challenges.…
We would love to see everyone across the globe in decent jobs, and more empowerment for women. In India we are campaigning for implementing a job creation model, which will provide dignity & happiness to 1250 million Indians. See thread
We all concerned about unemployment. But the bitter truth, we aren't a team to pursue PM @narendramodi to look at new revolutionary job creation road map. Your RT make a team of us to solve the serious job problem speedily. #MindMine2018 #BharatKiBaatSabkeSaath …
She would B a good president for U all over there. But we need jobs in America so she should B focus on Americans 1st. But we wont vote for her just California.Thats where she got millions of votes. @HillaryClinton U will not be Americas president and u races towards black women
The job creation model refereed here is not about jobs for one nationality, but for making life more fair for everyone.. It's not about redistributing-existing jobs to Americans by snatching from non-Americans, but about creating more job opportunities to cover everyone eligible.
You're the queen of financial support!!! Bought and paid for. The best of the best. Well enjoy your time...your time behind bars will hopefully be coming soon! #DrainTheSwamp #ClintonCrimes
And the people of Haiti are still waiting for their money
AND our husbands are too.....unbelievable to me, mine jumped up in a meeting and said, "I'll run against him." I see so many people who have finally stepped out of their comfort zone and are standing up.

Remind us of the gender of the  candidate who had more funding support than all the other nominees combined.  Take your time.

Hillary president 2020
Healthy?
And look at how successful Sweden is.

ALERT ALERT ALERT HILLARY AMERICA NEEDS HOPE PLEASE CHALLENGE THE ELECTION RESULTS OF 2016 MUELLER KNOWS TRUMP AND GOP CHEATED TO WIN THE ELECTION THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FOR THEIR CRIMES YOU AND BILL CAN GIVE AMERICA HOPE PLEASE CHALLENGE THE ELECTION AMERICA RETWEET
CAN A PRIVATE CITIZEN CHALLENGE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IF THEY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN CHEATED BY THE OPPOSING PARTY I'M SAYING PARTY BECAUSE I BELIEVE PAUL RYAN AND MITCH MCCONNELL WAS AWARE OF TRUMP'S CHEATING AND MAY ALSO BE COMPLICIT AS WELL AS CONSPIRING WITH TRUMP & RUSSIANS
You mean the part where Obama abused the FISA court with a false dossier paid for by Hillary to get permission to spy on Trump?  You mean that cheating by the opposing party?
MANY WOME; PF COLOR HAVE BECOME CONSERVATIVE BUSINESS OWNERS PROVING WORK GETS THEM RESULTS
You lost because you suck!  Give it up!
Hillary. Much love from the UK. In these troubling times I wish you had won the election, why? Because we wouldn't be going through troubling times now
 You have common sense which I'm afraid trump does not. Yes I missed out the capital for his name because he does not deserve it
You had more financial support than your opponent during the 2016 presidential election. 

And still lost.
It is looking like targeting of voters in key states via illegally obtained Facebook users pushed on the fence voters over to Trump.  

So that didn't help & a majority of  Americans voted for NOT TRUMP.
The DNC and RNC spent 81 million on FB ads. The Russian Troll farm spent 46k.... 1 oit of 200 to 300 ads possible came from a Russian funded firm. Next excuse lol
Record numbers of women are running because of the path YOU literally busted your ass to pave for 3 decades! We still have a WAYS to go, but would be lightyears behind where we are with YOU -- #ForeverOurPresident. #PeoplesPresident. #trailblazer #badass #brilliant #POWERhouse
*without. damnit #grammarpolice ugh lol #pointremains ;)

 Hillary Clinton Admitting She is AGAINST Gay Marriage and FOR ...
The goal of activism and speaking out is to CHANGE society and their perspective. It's a credit to the LGBT community, our marches, grassroots, etc. that people who once spoke against us, changed their minds and PROGRESSED with society. That's how it SHOULD go.


@arenasummit waddle, waddle,waddle,lie,lie,lie,waddle,waddle,waddle,lie,lie,lie.
You were correct Mrs Clinton.
#CambridgeAnalytica is worse than #Watergate

#Trump & #Bannon should be imprisoned. 

A century ago, the Military would have executed them.

#TrumpIsATraitor 
#TrumpIsACriminal
Please explain how is worse than #ObamagateSpyingScandal Watergate you hayseed
For starters your so called Obama investigation is fake.

Second, Nixon only recorded the data of the Democratic party.

Trump did exactly that, plus used a brainwashing campaign against the #USA

Think of it this way, Kim Jung Un would have won the POTUS using this same thing.
Really?!

Does not look that way.
But when you are brainwashed to be PARANOID ABOUT "EVERYTHING", you basically cannot view the truth.

Has the blacks stole your food stamps?

Has the Deep State took away your guns?

How many times have you noticed @FoxNews reporting was false?
Well I can tell you never bothered to look anything up.

Just shows your stupidity.

You would vote for Kim Jung Un if he ran the same campaign.  Doesn't bother me, you are pissed off at the breaking News.

In fact I can tell from your comments, you never lived through #watergate

Miss you Hillary. Wish you were our President.
All Mrs. Clinton is concerned about is identity politics. That's why she lost the election. Can you even imagine her as president?!!

Bot
Bit
66% of all women voting this November
More votes for Trump.
I give you “tenacious” as a redeeming quality.  That’s about it!  Thank God for the wisdom of our Forefathers.  #electorate
You were right about everything ma'am.
How do you even live with yourself. I don’t get it. Do you ever feel remorse or are you such a good liar that you actually believe what you say?It’s such a conundrum. You are definitely an enigma.
I know how. She is telling the truth. Telling the truth is easy. That is why she sounds so logical.
You gotta be kidding, do your research! Shes a criminal  and wants one world order. Why do you think  so mad?  Watch shawn hannity or better  YET  look things up on utube
#fakenews. You explained nothing.
What do you need me explain?  Do your research
If I do my research, I come to another conclusion than yours. So yes, what you are saying is really vague.
Vince Foster, covering up for Bill's dirty deeds, stealing from the Whitehouse, Filegate, Huma Abedin, 30,000 missing emails, Clinton Foundation pay to play, Sniper Fire in Bosnia, Missing law firm records, Saul Alinsky and Arkancide.
Thats what i mean and thts just the clintons, think who all else has done things?  It goes bacj to 5 presidents. But Obama  n hillary are awful not to mention the shadow goverment, tht they hired
We're tired of hearing your "faux feminist" propaganda.

Why aren't you praising this hero instead ? Deputy Blaine Gaskill, he was alerted of the shooting, immediately responded and engaged the shooter at the Great Mills High School.He probably saved many lives.
I'll wait.
We don’t know that he saved any lives. Shot and killed his ex-girlfriend. May have been finished with that. May have then killed himself. We don’t know what his intentions were. We do know that two young people are dead because guns are too easy to obtain.
My mistake, one dead and one critically wounded. Maybe that’s OK with the NRA.
What does the #NRA have to do with a disgruntled boyfriend shooting his ex. What if he had used a knife, you'd say the blade was too long?
There's a reason the @NRA is there, to protect against ppl like you.
Go to your "Gun Free" zone and pray you don't ever have to use a gun.
HOW COME THEY AREN'T 50 POINTS AHEAD !!!!!!
CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR 
Well actually the only cigar holder in the Oval office was Monica Lewinsky  This is sad, my spell check actually has the correct spelling of her last name..
You lost hard bitch! You got red pilled by our president hard. MAGA BITCH! Live with it!
You would know seeing as you've lived off other people's money your whole life. Can always rent out Lincoln's bedroom!
Does this include how to get money while being lazy and a liar? Just wondering....
Unless you're running the DNC then none of them get critical financial support it all goes to you!


You have nothing to do with women.  You are selfish and all that you did was about Hillary Clinton, nobody else.
Stop already
i love you Hillary
Beep boop beep I am a Russian bot, you were the worst presidential candidate in history.
Doesn’t make it better ! Your are soon to be in shackles ! So one soon to be gone ! Good smart honest women , yes run for Office . But meme like you! Go to NK, ask Kim if you can help !
please stop playing the gender card, start talking about the big problems, such as do you think increasing the tariff is good or bad for US and the world?
Did you struggle with campaign donations?
Lol!
My wish if joint your party
Hillary I believe the Republicans are really worried about you winning the popular vote. They are coming down on you hard some days.  Keep that smile and your encouraging support of women is heartwarming.  Hugs to the family today and everyday.
The b*tch #CrookedHillary literally colluded with Donna Brazil to steal the debate questions and she still lost!!  #HillaryClinton sucks that bitter lemon every day knowing she’ll never be @POTUS!!  #LockHerUp #JeffSessions #ClintonCrimeFamily #ClintonEmails
And they want you to be quiet.  Please keep talking, you are helping the Republicans!!
It's sad that powerful people get away with murder you and your husband who lied under oath should be in jail for all the lies all the fraud all manipulation you both have encountered.

Still sobbing in your vodka?

Your loss was 515 days ago, yet you still blame everyone but yourself. If you want to inspire women, then get on with your life & stop being a crybaby! Even Al Gore knew to stop bellyaching, & he was a laughing stock for…

Foundations with same last name, middle East human rights and trafficking, Russian deals and earthquake victims in Haiti
A billion dollars didn't help you. Stop making up excuses for losing.
Like ANYone wants election strategy advice from you?!? @HillaryClinton no one had to tell previous LOSERS to “go AWAY” the fact that the Amer. people rejected them at the voting booth was a big clue that no one wanted them. Lay off the booze, find some dignity.
Waaa. Waaaa, Waaaaa,  how old are you?    YOU LOST.   You were worse than the guy who won.   Period.  Think about that. You lost fair and square.   Give it up because u will never be the first woman president.     The only thing you wanted..That title.  It’ll will never be yours.
Then why did Donald Trump beat you with only a fraction of the money you spent? Maybe it is about the message and the middle class. You had none and are trying to kill the blue collar worker.
You lost!! PresidyTrump cares not about what you have to say. MAGA
Killory why don't u just shut the he'll up? Your an embarrassment to your family and America.  You belong in jail. You are a complete failure as a woman. You have no ethics or morals. Will never be elected again but hope u try.

All women and the poor - help these students - help these students

You are a disgusting human being and always have been

Hillary Clinton is a "supporter of women" in the same way that someone who financially aides, is financially aided by, participates in, and covers up sex slaves and sex trafficking is said to be a "supporter of women." SO, in that EXACT SAME WAY, @HillaryClinton is no different.
