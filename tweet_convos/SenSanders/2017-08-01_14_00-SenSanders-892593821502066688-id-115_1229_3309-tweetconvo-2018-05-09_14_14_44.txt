yes good idea Trump shud agree immediately
SO CENK, WILL YOU STAY WITH BERNIE THIS TIME. IT WILL SAVE CITIZENS BILLIONS, MAKE SICK& OLD MEDS AFFORDABLE
Thank you @SenSanders for your continuing service to our country  #democracy
Just pick up 5 of my meds.. with high deductible insurance I paid 216.54. That's for only 5.  4 more to go for the month...
Marijo, try Costco (no, you don't have to be a member to use their pharmacy) and Walmart.  And possibly another doc, (9 meds?!?!).
Thank you I'll try The meds are between 2 Drs. Several medical problems
How about health insurance?
big Pharma price gouge hits all, redistributed cost via premiums jacking up.
Government needs to stop getting their noses into what they shouldn't.
Easy way to solve that: kill corporate welfare.
What is corporate welfare?
Public paying for research/industry profiting, patent office, Import/Export Bank, subsidies, bailouts, monopoly via regulation/legislation,
Pharma & military in bed making vaccines/drugs is disturbing enough. Using taxpayer $ to do it & gouge taxpayer again in resale is obscene.
Bernie Sanders is a pathetic Socialist who will destroy America's Constitutional Republic via the brainwashed Millennial's - @POTUS
Absolutely nothing.
You nailed it. Citizens United is the disease. While that exists the we have NO representation. That's the bar to get my vote.
Another shakedown of big business by #left
R
Go Bernie!
@SenSanders @BernieSanders  how about a bill to punish big pharma for pushing opioids and docs from overprescribing.
How about you propose a bill to protect American's from leaches like you? How many houses do you need Bernie? 3 on a lifelong servant salary
TyT keeps it real
Bernie sanders stole that from president trump who has been working on cheaper mess iver a year
@DraftTulsi @BernieSanders Let's hear Trump's position from Trump, not from HuffPo.
@SenSanders @BernieSanders What was the name of that legislation: 13 Dems & 39 rep voted against? Need to starting shaming.
Sister, Bernie can't respond. We need to research ourselves to fight against corporate $ investment in propaganda. http://bit.ly/2jd6jSp 
Finally people are talking but it's democrats as well as republicans we the many need to take it back AMERICAN corporate government must go!
This is a good move
I guess @benshapiro was right when he accused you of kissing Bernie's ass fir over a year
why do you deny the armenian genocide
They don't, they did segment on it, it's on youtube. they commemorated the genocide.
Bless him! I hope it passes. Here script cost $700/90 days. Through Canada $107/90 days. Same stuff - something wrong with our system.
I have RA the my Dr had giving me sample of this cream She ran out I got presc filled it 197.00 looked up $10.00 over the counter in CA.
If congress really cares about the VOTING CITIZENS OF AMERICA, they will do all they can to lower the skyrocketing cost of medications 4 us!
.same man who voted no to investigate. #TrumpRussia
Bingo!! Either the US is being gouged or we are subsidizing EU and Canada's healthcare. And US tax $ pays for much of the basic research.
You nailed that. It's part of "redistributing wealth among nations" Ppl need to understand Marxist Globalists mean globally. 34K a yr is 1%.
Huge majority of the country tired of being ripped off why is Bernie only one man enough to speak up about it. #paidoff
How are we getting ripped off? Insurance pays for the drugs and the ethics involved are controlled by open market dynamics. Socialization no
feds give pharma monopolies: "exclusive rights to produce", including generics. Did you not watch the video, pharma research paid by taxes?
@SenBookerOffice sold out Americans with big Pharma b/c of big campaign donations. @SenSanders won't even get solid Dem votes on this. SAD.
So ignorant, sad
Eh... @SenBookerOffice did indeed take big pharma money and vote against a way to lower drug prices. This is a fact.
What had he worked out on his wife fraud case
You Go Bernie!!
It would be interesting if @SenSanders had to publicly decide which new drug development got canceled because of his power pandering.
Bernie, crazy socialism idea, Venezuela: a nation devoured by socialism
Bernie is a joke
Bernie, Ur crazy socialism:  Venezuela a nation devoured by socialism
A noble effort. What is needed more is a mass awakening to the poison that they are pushing by robotic doctors following corrupt research.
US needs to fix this corruption because it is dragging the rest of the world with it. Canada repeatedly signs trade agrmnts that  prices.

It probs involves paying pharma companies American peoples' tax money.  Just like the ACA pays insurance companies to keep prices lower...
this is so important!!!
Cue a couple million in donations to Paul Ryan et al.  Poof problem solved
@realDonaldTrump This is pathetic, Trump, you are a horrible person, a horrible American and a horrible president! This should be a easy yes
No , bernie , do associate yourself with these hacks
What about this? Looks like #AmyKlobuchar & several Dem cosponsors https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=F235BB39-964A-4809-A4F3-B4E487F3F960 … for #Medicaire negotiations re drug prices
Think how much $ big pharma could save if they didn't advertise on TV. Why does gen pop have to learn about drugs?  That's our docs' job!
US, only 1 of 2 countries on the planet that allows drug ads.  Newest, most $ advertised. 70% of docs will give patient prescr. if they ask.
Bernie Sanders is also the victim of #dncfraud.  Care to comment?

Read @jkirchick on the intellectuals & journos who praised Venezuela under Chavez http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-venezuela-pundits-20170802-story.html … Special shout out to @AbbyMartin
Less cost for pharmaceutical medicines is the way forward. Let's regulate pharmacies cost so people can have cheaper medicines.
If the pharma market is opened up than these American companies can no longer have a monopoly.

@SenSanders Thank you Senator Sanders! #Medicare4ll #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
@SenatorCardin @ChrisVanHollen  I hope you support this
Where are all the Republicans and Democrats who should be endorsing Bernie's plan? Go Bernie!
You should not be on tv dude. U have a face for radio.
I'm paying zip for my two eye drops with my Medicare Advantage plan. I have mail order and get 90 day supply. not all bad Bernie Hypocrite
See what we could have done if the beach @HillaryClinton and her minions had not sabotaged @BernieSanders
In 3 mos an eye drop medication for one month to treat glaucoma went from $163 to $192 and keeps increasing!
Put an end to the Pharma lobbying efforts in Congress & courting physicians with incentives.
There's your free market@annCaltor#TYT
Then will have to stop subsidising the world 's drug prices which is like building a wall
None what so ever I know how it feels can't get what I need damn cancer#StopTheMadness


Hear hear
Go Bernie!!!
Years ago I did temp work. It hardly paid anything. City hosp.  would let U see Doctors & supply meds. You paid what U could.
I paid what I could. If employees from all company's took just 1 dollar from their pay. People would have health care.
I will forever be grateful for this, I could not pay for insurance at that time. It's sad when you see ppl in such need.
Protip: if you want to win public support for your bill, don't associate yourself with Cenk. He's toxic.

I've got a much better idea.  All taxpayer backed research should go Straight to Generic, No monopoly!  Period!
That might create too much competition could cost some of our politicians some payback money.
The problem boils down to these pharmaceutical Companies wanting to keep us not too sick, but sick enough to keep on buying their product
Fuck Cent and his vote for Hillary
@SenSanders
@BernieSanders

Now is the time to purge
those using your name to attack #Black #Women #Democrats.
The alt-left is no longer the Bernie wing. These people are uncompromising extremists with a cult of personality. https://twitter.com/mic/status/892120280247795716 …

@JohnCornyn @tedcruz @JudgeTedPoe @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #Resist hey people, representatives, please listen to this.
Check the Aussie PBS. Prices, margins negotiated, concessions to the chronically ill, safety net  - free scripts, generics promoted
Good! Trump haven't talk about this issue much and is important for WE THE PEOPLE.
Thank you @SenSanders
And...there goes advancements in medicine. Yesssss continue to dream of all the production you are siezing. Taxition is theft
are you suggesting the only incentive for advancements in medicine is $$$ and we should continue to allow this?
Yes......and yes?  Who is "we"? And, the precedent that you are implying is dangerous.
SANDERS/COMEY 2020
We don't need protection . scam
Still not over that #CravenSanctionsBullshit so keep trying Bernard #NotMyUncle
Are you saying you're mad that sen sanders voted no on the sanctions bill? Just clarifying.
He is too late, I fear.
Socialized drugs will destroy pharmaceutical industry. Sanders is out of his mind and speaks for himself not the majority.
1/2 Yeah! Like it destroyed the pharm industry in all those other socialized countries! France.. oh wait that's where the pharm is from..
This guy is such a fraud.
You mean more price gouging? Meds are so expensive now that the poor and elderly can't afford it. It's why hospitals charge $7 per tablet.
Surprised Cenk could walk and talk so soon after getting f**ked so hard by Shapiro.
EVIL !!! EVIL !!! SOCIALISM !!! ... (no sarcasm font )
Most people put /s. To indicate sarcasm
Haven't seen that before, must hang out in different threads. Thanks
I also use :s for sarcasm.  There are several options.  I wish #SarcMark would take off.  http://www.sarcmark.com/

Bernie RT!
Hey, Bernie retweeted you @cenkuygur
Bernie Sanders should propose a law to remove  capitalism from our democracy. Our planet is dying by it. And eventually our species.
when u have gov pay the bill , the price go up to a insane amount , its called gread to do kick backs to gov
After getting spanked at Politicon you would think these snarky losers would stop sucking Breadline Bernie's little schmeckel
Bank Fraud Bernie should propose legislation to protect BANKS from lending to the dead beat SANDERS!!
Thank you @SenSanders :)
Companies are not 'French', they are multi-national, they trade on global markets and use different regulatory frameworks to their advantage
As long as we save, wgaf
As we have seen recently, it's easy to propose stuff you know won't happen when you are out of power.
Seriously boggles my mind.  Domestic Pharma must be pissed.
Kleptocracy rules Congress...
@BernieSanders continues to be the only Senator that seems to truly care about Americans.

Big Pharma are bigger scumb than Wall Street.
what is scumb?
By stopping price gouging? Please explain. They are charging over $600 for something that cost them less than $15 to produce.
Flake
Cons are doing everything in their power to destroy the current insurance market.
