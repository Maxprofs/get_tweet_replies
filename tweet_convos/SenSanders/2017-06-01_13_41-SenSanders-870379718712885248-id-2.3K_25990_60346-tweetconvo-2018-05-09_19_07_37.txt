Bernie Sanders=enemy to the constitution#draintheswamp
But treason is cool with you right.. #republicanlogic
Treason!? Ok life is easier if stay in ur snowflake bubble.
Not sure what would make me a traitor but sure is better than supporting a killer/crook or Bernie who wanted 2 give my hard earned $ away
I feel like treason would be hating and attacking the man who fairly won our democratic election.
Hang it up Bernie. #AmericaFirst is here to stay, no matter how much the illustrious golden boy socialist/globalist doesn't like it
The Earth is 4.5 Billion years old. It has survived and prospered without the Paris accord! Liberal tree huggers..it's all about $$$$$$$
Should not have one person with ultimate powers over the people. This is insanity. Laws need to change to thwart despicable dictators.
But it was ok for Obama to link up to this without going through congress?
195 other countries signed this accord. You want to be part of 2 (Nicaragua, Syria) that aren't on board? Ridiculous.
You realize that other countries don't dictate us right? We kinda put an end to that in 1776
Nah, you rather dictate other countries, as you have done in the past 70 years. Apart from that, being the biggest poluter in the world and
refusing to play your part in doing something about that, does that strike you as a sane deal? Or do you think 'God' will clean it up?
I think the best deal would be what ever is best for the US, I don't care about other countries because I don't live in another county
WE voted trump in to look after OUR best interest, not some leftist across the ocean
Trump has no concept of doing things for a greater good. Thank God for Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Justin @JustinTrudeau
@SenatorLeahy  please save us please #ImpeachmentIsInevitable
So is socialism
I love you but you and the other democrats are doing nothing. It has been six months of sheer terror on America. Do something or be quiet.
He saved us unimaginable money by withdrawing from a political con.

I only hope he stays with us for another 4 years.

... uno sguardo al centro della terra preso alla lettera....
Burn Bernie Burn the climate is going to be ok 
@realDonaldTrump President is right in this case, there is lots of loot on the name of environmental issues ,nothing is happening on ground
. Total disgrace
By making him POTUS in the first place was an American disgrace, now he has 33 million followers on twitter, a very sad time for USA/WORLD?
About 15 million are Russian bots!
I wish Trump's father had withdrawn ...
But at least.... Mar-a-Lago will become an underwater resort. YAAAY!!! MAGA MAGA MAGA!
#Trump has the best instincts ever. If there's even the slightest possibility that he could make the worst decision he'll nail it every time
It is not about economy or America.... it is about TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. Everything he does. The beloved strong leader...
WH insanity, horrible & inexcusable
#RomeIsBurning
just him waking up in the morning is an international disgrace
His only existence is a disgrace. He is an awful human being.
Why is #Impeachment so hard to proceed?
"Disgrace" is a very soft term, alluding to some behavioral mistake. In reality, withdrawal from the #Parisclimateaccord is a death sentence
Damn right Bernie it is a disgrace and will hinder us in the future
I'm all for "America First" and everything..but having Earth second..thats ridiculous..I wonder if he is even aware that America is on Earth
That's not the point. Most of the stuff in the agreement doesn't even benefit the environment. The Paris Accord is a sham.
Source?
Yet virtually every other country on Earth is on board.
He said virtually.... yes you Libs do live in a virtual reality.  Talking about facts... with words like virtually... 
Ok skippy. Let me spell it out for you. Every country in the world except Syria and Nicaragua.
BTW.  Nicaragua didn't sign because the accord didn't go far enough.
Also who said I was liberal?
Just like when you #SoldOut to @HillaryClinton and let down all your fans how much gas do your luxury cars produce? Or your 3 mansions????
Bernie, it's about time someone had the balls to look out for the US of A, no disgrace here.
. Please keep fighting him!
A day later, Kathy Griffin is holding up his severed head. Seriously, are liberals this extreme??? Disturbed....
Your boobs that fill out your picture in disturbing!
Q: Why won't the Republicans impeach Trump?
A: Republicans insist on carrying a baby to full term.
You made me laugh out load!!!
Of course the sycophants that support you will not see the free public  so I'm sure you're butt hurt over that. Sure u sold out on that too
It was highly intelligent. Paris made negligible difference for a huge imvestment. How about invest here on new R&D that will actually help
Soooo true
Senator Sanders, there's no logical reason to continue the current agreement. You're taking about millions of dollars over .3 degrees #MAGA
And you're blocked, ignorant conservative asshole. Money over people's lives? You're a disgrace.
Go live with polar bears bernie 
Are you asking Bernie to drown?  The polar bears are because of the lack of ice.
More Fake News NASA says otherwise
@allenequincy It's a disgrace that Americans allowed this to happen..what happened to American Pride!!
People watch this and RT this is insane.    Wake up people...
Oh my God! D ocean is going to dry and the planets are going to explore. Life is over as we knew it! Oh my God the drama!
Oceans drying up is the complete opposite of the reality. Typical R wing ignorance with the facts. #dumbases
I forgot the best one. The Sun is moving to another galaxy due to Trumps withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
Ok potatoes head!
You all lost. Get over it.
You don't question the moves they make that effect us all? That is an unacceptable retort. Get educated. Don't live in a "us vs. them"world
I also do find it fascinating when I don't agree with an idea being shoved down my throat it MUST be that I'm uneducated
But when I've made educated statements reflecting concern for the greater good of country and position in the world I need to get over it?
They are selfish greedy heartless people. They do not care about any greater good.
Symbolistic accords are not for the greater good, that's all this Paris Accord was. There was no substance to it.
US backing out is embarrassing when we are #2 worst polluter afterChina but it's cool, despite Trump, cities & states will still do our part
I'm really glad to hear states stepping up to the plate. If only Florida would be one of them!
@joerogan @theRussell2000 @KingJamesCalvin
Yeah well maybe if he wasn't screaming about Hillary being a corporate democrat the gay pure leftist would have voted for her
But he loves em pussy
When it affects your loved ones u will realize bro!
Thank goodness for Bernie!!
This is much more than a disgrace - this is dangerous. To america and to the world. SO what do we do now?
The Paris deal was funny. China the leaders of emissions would increase co2 20more years? This was Obama's mistake @SenSanders
How? How was this HIS mistake?
You don't understand the agreement.
I don't think I know it 100% but it's summaries aren't in the interest of USA nor climate. @NickBiggerstaff @SenSanders
The accord was voluntary. Each country set its own targets - so it's demagogic to compare or to think the US "lost" like it was a game
Nick you are entitled to your opinion but tell me a justification why China would pledge to increase its emissions until 2030 before it starts reducing it. on the other hand USA reduces by 20%. Remember reducing emissions is a cost in production and china is a leading emitter
Actually that would be you
Thank you for speaking truth to power
I love President Trump he's my hero.
Nobody cares Sanders, you're the discrace for dropping any standards you had by choosing Killary.  You losers gotta stick together....
It is actually saving the tax payers a ton of outgoing cash. It was a simple redistribution of wealth from America to the rest of the world.
Give me a break, so many support his decision. Obviously Bernie does not put America first, only himself.
You don't really know what the Paris Agreement is, do you? Ah! A Trump supporter, huh? That explains that...
I never said who I supported. If you read the Accord you would know what your talking about.
You're, not your
wow, that's all you got? Figures.
As a Socialist you advocate for the destruction of America. Not surprising you support bankrupting us with this bad deal. #ParisClimate
The trillions of dollars in wars is totally not what is driving the US into dept, it's the food stamps. (Sarcasm)
But @SenSanders, hasn't 'Everything' he's done been a disgrace?
I know we say that often about politicians but w/him its 100 percent true prob is if we impeach him we have to deal with even worse pence
We'll deal with #Pence when we get there
You are an Anti-American gangster, go move to a different country if you don't like this one.
You'll helped put him in the White House. Take a seat.
Trump incorrectly labels Philippines robbery a terror attack as Trump incorrectly pulls out of Paris accord @business @MSNBC @MsLeaSalonga
Thanks fir helping make that happen Bernie.  Thanks a lot. 
Of course, blame everyone for HRC's loss, but HRC! Do you need a reminder on which politician took millions from Wall Street, Big Pharma etc
Still don't know how you weren't elected Mr. Sanders, or even given a shot at running against this idiot
Have you carefully looked into the views held by the educated opposition to climate change theory and the proposed measures?   You should.
You are old enough to remember in the 70s we were all going to die because man was causing the next ice age! It's all BS...
yah you lied to us Bernie, you didn't tell us that we were losing production in paper, cement, natural gas, while China/India use more coal
So we lose thousands of jobs Bernie while those jobs are replaced in other counties. meanwhile the environment doesn't get better. SCAM!!!
Snowflakes pls
Agreed
Senate would not have approved because the people don't want this.  Real scientists know that the climate change is not manmade.
Karma! becoz it will get you in the end!
@billmaher I am saddened, enraged, disgusted and ashamed. I cannot understand the man. What kind of person supports him?
Keep working for the people, Senator. We thank you for your earnest efforts.
Giving American money to foreign countries to sustain industries America has been condemned for is bs. I get it, they are poor and need jobs
Were you talking? Sorry I was to busy listening to MY president. You know the thing that you wanted to be but you lost.
Impeachment will take too long. It's already been too long. He's "having his way" with America, doing his "business" on Americans. Enough.
Loser speaks!
The POTUS is disgusting! He has no clue! u BS!
I voted for you, but you're wrong.  This is a bad "trade" deal.  We get nothing for it.
What are you talking about it's not a trade deal, we get to be at the front of one of the fastest growing industries, and a cleaner planet
It's a sad day for money grabbing elites.  Most of that money would have gone into the pockets of dictators and leftwing politics
You have my support
They are laughing at US (you) potus. We now have common goal with Syria..........SAD
The American people are not buying into a wealth redistribution scheme anymore! #covfefe
"Bernie or bust" was also a disgrace that brought US Trump
Disgusting acts of election fraud and cheating thanks to @HillaryClinton @DNC was what gave us Trump. #WakeUp #BernieWouldHaveWon #DemExit
This breaks my heart.  Thank you for speaking your mind Bernie!  This mom in Vermont is very proud and thankful for you!!!
When the last tree is cut down, the last fish eaten, and the last river poisoned, you will realize that you cannot eat money.”
Saving Americans billions of dollars, creating millions of jobs and not  allowing countries to take advantage of America, no wonder you lost
With the start of Hurricane season, how ironic it would be if Mar-a-Lago gets hit by a Cat 5 storm.  #climatechange
The Paris agreement was NEVER RATIFIED by Congress. That is a disgrace.
Obesity,smoking and alcohol is a problem but Trump supporters would say cars,aeroplanes also kill people so people should bare guns
Nope, what Hillary & the DNC did to you during the primaries is a national disgrace!
It's ALL about #TheMoneyMen and their LAZINESS in not finding NEW #SourcesOfProfit other than #PutinOIL! Actually, #ProfitIsUnsustainable!
@richsrobinson #maga Luv ur music bro but u got this one wrong
YET ANOTHER EMBARRASSMENT TO THE U.S., IN THE FORM OF AN ASSAULT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR HEALTH.  GREAT JOB DT.
And he will continue to disgrace us until we will fall into a third world status and our kids & grandkids will inherit it all!
Lecture on molecular science. Id listen. CO2 is a GAS. the atmosphere is held together by ions.#climatechangehoax
The real liar doofus puppet fake president @realDonaldTrump is the biggest international disgrace in the world. So SAD!
He is creating jobs! The agreement will be re-written to be fair and create jobs! Previous was a US give away!

Legally he can't till 2019.But he'll be out before it is ratified.
No no its not. It puts America's interest first. Not all of us can enjoy being part of the 1%.
What @janeosanders did to Burlington College is a disgrace
When @BernieSanders became the official #DNC mascot it was a disgrace!
#Hypocrite
not really since the accord would have no affect on temperatures or climate at all, but was a political move only.
Taking the "buy out" payoff from Hillary was more of a disgrace, in fact, it was obscenely disgraceful. #SheStillCouldntWin #GotYourMoney
Wealth  Breathing
get it right in 2018 and 2020 please
He is always a disgrace.
Bernie go home.
So are u Bernie
Bernie..have you even read the accord? If so, and you still feel this way..well thank god Hillary screwed you out of the presidency.
Luckily he can't actually pull out till 2020 two days after next election and no way is he president in 2020
WRONG
We need Congress to enable affordable alt. energy, sustainable diets, & rewards to industry who allow telecommuting & don't pollute.
Sanders is a hypocritical bullshitter! He had a lot of  idiots believing his Lies! Free Everything who's paying,Not Him, The Taxpayers
Will u people do something about him before he kills us all
Your crazy!!!!!!!!!
So Bernie, what are you guys doing about it?  Talk and rhetoric are cheap.  The world will measure Americans on what they do next.
Oh man, so sorry for you guys below the 49th parallel. Our force is with you!  from 
#knobgoblin
Your support of SAVAGE FALN Unrepentant Terrorist Rivera is a Disgrace
Lol.  Typical establishment
Guess they didn,t pay Trump enough,He talks about Hillary and heis the biggest dam Crook alive
Dems have become nothing but obstructionist a'-holes.  They don't have a message, a plan or anything but their stupid resist mantra.
Selfish, Arrogant, Dictator-in-the-making, narcissistic. #TrumpSoloPres
The uneducated people denying climate change are leaving behind a cesspool for their grand kids. Anything to make a buck !
Ironically, a lot of people who voted for Trump will lose their jobs due to his decision to pull out of the accord.
"this puts Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh... before Paris"

before Paris ??? what??

wasn't this about climate chg ???
Can't any of you guys do anything about this guy? No one knows any hitmen? I'd take Paul Ryan at this point
Does this really surprise anyone though? We can expect anything shocking from this administration!
Now is the time to accelerate the electric car industry, solar and wind power as the US example to the world and create jobs!
Disgrace is you continually talking about free education to avoid debt for young people-so you paying for their house or  too? That is debt
@billmaher No what President Trump did was put America First. Bill & Bernie YOU are a disgrace to America and to all Americans!
You 2 faced career politician. Get off the grid & stop using ur gas guzzler with all ur money, then talk about climate change. U R a sad man
Thanks Bernie for continuing to speak your mind & make sense in this crazy world we've got right now.  So grateful for you
What about #Paris #Texas?
Just add it to the ever-growing list of his disgraces.
K ya gonna finally campaign for impeachment then, boo boo?
Bernie, we all know it's all about GREED! And stupidity!! 
I feel ashamed for our country, in a place where seemingly we have no recourse for these unilateral illogical decisions of a ranting buffoon
Can we focus on fighting hunger first .
He's an international disgrace. And please stop calling him President. This is like calling a deadbeat "dad" a "father."
Says the guy that sold out his followers for a private jet.
Trump is irresponsible, selfish, ignorant, arrogant ...but people voted for him...I wonder, why peope do not beleive in #climatechange ???
Go take a nap  and wake up on the trump side of the bed old man
It's national fuck the earth day , this is the worst thing DT has done ! Second to them Russia conspiracy!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mr. Sanders is correct. You have embarrassed US. Get your head out of your ass - SIR! @SenWarren @SenJohnMcCain
Sorry Bernie-YOU are the international disgrace
Hillary and the DNC screwed you and you are mad at Trump? Hillary must have paid you really well.
And control
The Paris accord is a disgrace trying to steal from America to cause nominal benefit.If there is concern,look to countries that pollute.
Get him Bernie!
Just go away
You have dirty Russian hands, Bernie. Own this
Yeah, sure Bernie, 1 billion to the green fund
THANK YOU BERNIE!
US has turned into the laughing stock of the world thanks to Trump.
If there's a way to survive this madness, I hope we can find it as a species.
What @hillarycliinton and @TheDemocrats did to you was also a international disgrace and the reason for this @POTUS a new American Party?
Was coming up with a plan to go green too much trouble??
Very sad news for America
Much like you @SenSanders a international disgrace. Capitalism > socialism.
I tried it, but doesn't look any better after sleeping over it. A very bad light on America. Very bad.
he is a disgrace
So, both sides are right and wrong at the same time....deeeeeeep
Shut up, Bernie.  Your cult helped put him in the White House.
Go away. You are part of the problem. Let me count the ways.
shut up Bernie...your confused
