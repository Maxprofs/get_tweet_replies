If the voter machines & rolls were hacked then we are owed a new election @SenateDems @GOP @tedlieu
Sorry but the dead people & Illegal aliens that voted, voted 4 Hitlery. Trump still won!
Not what the NSA  docs seem to infer
Really. Try "discussing" doing something about our cancerous far right wing extremists lying media
Carefull Charlie, you don't want to upset Rush, Glenn or Shaun!
Nearly impossible to upset sociopaths worth hundreds of millions $ in blood money.
How about term limits for old has beens like yourself?
I'm afraid Missouri is a threat for democracy. Tensions high from some Republicans in voting booths.
Best president ever
Are you referring to President Obsma, President Clinton or T. Bannon
Bernie ofc. He's the true new President. But I do still miss Obama aswell
Here are the books I mentioned during @SenSanders interview

long live PRESIDENT TRUMP @realDonaldTrump
Voter ID how about that for a reformComrade!
My fav #bernietweet
Why is it we need a photo ID for everything we do in this Country except to vote!
Thats what i am talking about Bernie!
In GER state pays the parties 0,70€ per vote. Parties pay the campaign of their candidates. Don't have to be rich to run for parliament.
At least someone is working for america!
You watch too much CNN! Trump is working tirelessly to repair thevdamage done by the democrats
Pls start talking about how Trump hasn't nominated people to 100's of important positions.Shame into action... oh wait he is shameless. #sad
Do we really want HIM to fill them?
Would you rather have nobody heading FEMA during the next natural disaster?
It's called get an ID
Sure voting rights for illegal Really?
Thank you, we absolutely need a fair election.
Wonder why trump kept saying it was rigged, he knew. Scary times.
Are you going to donate 90% of your million dollars you earned last year or is that only for the REST of the 1%?
I'd like you to discuss your hypocrisy.
Give it up!
I understand but tell us how we can get healthcare and defeat the monster.
free market?
You're going to want 2watch.

WOW! Been hearing stuff like that all my adult life.
America needs voter ID laws!
Nobody cares bern
I wonder why job creation is never on your list...oh, because you have no idea! 
Why not go all the way and #UNRIG the election system, not just one part?
Yes your major undemocratic campaign financing has to be reformed ...
How about #voterID illegal aliens and dead people should not be voting.  #feelthebern
Reading the tabloids again?

Make sure you clarify that voting is not for those here illegally.
Yeah only true American citizens can vote not every person from another country that's not a citizen.
Burning do you think illegal alien should be able to vote in presidential election?
We need to get rid of Super PACs, ALL Political Special Interests Groups and any Political Donation larger than $5000.
A little f*cking late to the game! Mousy on #electionfraud thanks for nothing!
Good work senator! I agree with you that we need Voter IDs!!
Are you going to cover the rights of non-US citizens to vote in our elections?
Why not constitutional amendments on campaign finance reform & term limits while you're at it?Or are you only interested in limited reforms?
He's working for himself
Aren't you a hypocrite to criticize rich people when you are one?
Should he side with those who commit flagrant injustices?
He just shouldn't pretend to be one of the 99% that's all. There's nothing wrong with making money legally, that is. @SenSanders misleads.
Did you just get a nearly $1 million advance to write a book about rich people? Vile hypocrite 
Why aren't you discussing impeachment or the 25th amendment?
Try discussing term limits, yeah, that's what I thought
Who r you fighting to give voting rights to? Felons? Non-Citizens? A person's 2nd, 3rd, or 4th vote of the day? Non-felon citizens can vote.
Extend this further to vote hacking. See @mikefarb1 &@SwissTriple_M. Check #unhackthevote .
So take a star out of teachers draw.
Please be my president, although I could see why you wouldn't want the shite job
Well surprise me Bernie.  You want illegal aliens to vote.  Actually, that wouldn't surprise me.

SENATOR SANDERS I'M SURE WITH THIS ELECTION EVERYONE HAS LEARNED MANY LESSONS!
U fold like a lawn chair to back a crook in HRC.Your credibility is called into question. So now you wanna preach democracy.Give me a break
ID should be shown to vote. Not on rolls no vote. No id no vote. #voterfraud #demvoterfraud
If you are registered it is your duty &right to vote. If you are a citizen and you are not registered, do it. If GOP won't let you, . .
. . Scream loud & long until you are heard. The GOO does not want you to vote & will cheat & suppress to prevent it.
Explain how a public servant made $1million? YOU?
Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Please discuss term limits too, they are needed just as badly.

Should be discussing voter fraud and murder #sethrich
Good I will be glad when only American Citizens can vote and no illegals given our special rights and privileges
Noncitizens cannot vote. You shouldn't listen to that fucknugget president of yours. He makes you look very uninformed.
But they do its a proven fact there is illegal voting going on I say Photo Voter Id cards for legal citizens only you look uniformed
What about your supporters that are getting death threats from the DNC, discuss that.
You lost to the candidate that lost to The Donald.
Because of Superdelegates. LOL at "voting rights" in the "Democratic" party.
#FeelTheBern
Feels good to undermine your democracy, doesn't it, Tom?
Terrible.  those superdelegates are killing the party. Bernie shined a light right on them
But NOT #voterfraud you COMMUNIST HACK! Bernie is a paid puppet of Hillary and Putin...where did you honeymoon sir? WHERE!?!?!?!?
Old man why don't you stop dividing Americans,is it not yet time you give your life to Jesus Christ,how long will you continue in Sin Bernie
Love that the less than 100 instances found voted for Trump!
How many houses does one person need?
that has to be a short conversation since the democrats are the champs at voter fraud
So, Mr. 1 Percenter, I am guessing you are paying more taxes than required?
In before "lol Bernie signed a book deal hurr hurrr durr"
?
DNC is gonna flush your ass down the toilet. They don't care about you. That should of been evident last election.
Which is the top 1% of the 1%. We love you Bernie!
Please help us in Florida! Voter suppression is crazy here! Bust @FLGovScott
