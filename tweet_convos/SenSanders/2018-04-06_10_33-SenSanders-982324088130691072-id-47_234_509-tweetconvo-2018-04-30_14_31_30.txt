Trump and Bernie are both populists and both protectionists. Bernie should be honest and support the president on tariffs.

Shut up, American Trotsky! Nobody wants your Bolshevism.
But but but but? trumpence-ski said all the great jobs were coming BACK to 'merica! Like all those clothing manufacturing jobs in China, paying $350 A MONTH, really want to come back here to pay $350 A WEEK? All those catering jobs at Mar a Lago? & NY? bc NO 1 local wants them?
Thought this type of unfairness was going to stop with Trump?  Oh yes, and Mexico will pay for the wall.....
You get 28 minutes of WE ALREADY HAVE A STALKER - EP 6 - Princess Evangile.
@SenSanders you are doing the same to @Tim_Canova that @SenWarren did to you. CUT IT OUT! Show you really are on the progressive side and get behind @Tim_Canova or explain why not!!!NOW!
Again where exactly r American jobs? Bring back American companies from foreign soil ! Give ppl the jobs Trumpster Dumpster promised! They r waiting ...don't hold your breath Trumpster won't make good on providing decent jobs for ppl..,more like slaves 2 the state!
These jobs aren’t on any soil. They’re up in the friendly skies! 
Yeah, but it ISNT extremely profitable, is it?!
Several airlines are operating on very slim margins.
listen, man. i love you. you're the best and i mean that ..keep kickin ass my brotha!

We need, like nurses, more mechanics, sir. Also, if parts are made overseas overseas technicians specialize in fixing them.
Logistics implied: This makes zero sense... Every airport in the whole world needs jet engine maintainers, right? Who could possibly insist otherwise. Ludicrous! THIS HAS TO @FreeBeacon NEWS!!!

Is that Moore JOBS THAT trump and pence have lost under their and gop rule of oppression?
We just need the world peace
And President Trump is fighting to change that.
Is that even good for national security?!?! Crazy.

IF @realDonaldTrump vs @SenSanders in 2020, who will win?
We need just World Peace!!!
SO BERNIE you agree with the POTUS!!!!!  BTW Top 20% of the richest will pay 87% of all income tax.

Where is Trumtard in keeping jobs in America
This was a trend when Obama was in office as well. Do you also blame him?
It's all about economics - something you know very little if anything about.

Let’s have #patriotic #corporations
Their profits are sky high
Despite their exhortations 
They want profits more than paying for the men and women who sign up to die

For this country

Just remember this when Teacher's Unions ask for your support.
When you have a president like the one we have don't expect good things to happen. Fake president Donny the lying commi.
If you read the story, it clearly sounds like this was a trend that started before Trump took office. And these are precisely the types of jobs he's trying to bring back by imposing tariffs. Tariffs, I'm sure you also complain about.
America needs to close it's doors to companies that betray loyalty.  The american worker should get a fair share of companies income also.
Maybe they'll relocate maintenance facilities here once you promise not to raise their taxes back to where they were. Put Pelosi back at the helm that's exactly what will happen.  #MAGA
Wasn't this a problem when an Alaska Aircraft corkscrewed itself into the drink 10 or 15 years ago?
This is very relevant. You all need to ask for a lot more than just keeping work here. Ask for real benefits.... REAL benefts... https://www.facebook.com/notes/bryan-canary/why-does-the-united-states-lack-bullet-trains-part-1/10215722240519189/ …
All major United State's airlines are doing faulty maintenance work overseas.  The FAA and NTSB needs to investigate these oversea MRO facilities!!!!!
LOL   Because Union employees deserve soooo much more....

No union has EVER helped a business.    EVER...
