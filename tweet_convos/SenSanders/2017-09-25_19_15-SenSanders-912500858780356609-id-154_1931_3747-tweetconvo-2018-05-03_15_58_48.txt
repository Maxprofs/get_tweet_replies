As a senior, with Social Security disability, I use select health advantage as my part D Medicare coverage. Since my husband  past 8/1/16, I was W/out insurance as of 9/1/16. I got hooked up W/SH a beginning 9/1/16. I have been hospitalized 3X since then. My coverage is great
#SuckerPunchingAmericans #GOP of #Liars
It's only sleazy if Lindsey Graham isn't doing #SleazyGraham
When the Koch Bros. are dangling $400 million in campaign bribes for the midterms, it changes minds.
Our system is corrupted by big business and small minds
When did Lindsey get in bed with #ALEC? His daddies aren't happy. He  looked pretty desperate and scared trying to get this bill passed.
Think they're afraid of KOCHS & losing BIG !
If G&C's goal was healthcare they would do it slowly & thoroughly.
Their goal is tax cuts & Medicaid is where they are stealing the $ from
Graham will go to whatever lobby is paying the most!

And 1987 Bernie wouldn't support Medicare For All.
30 years vs 7 
There's a time limit on hypocrisy?
there's certainly a statute of limitation. Especially since he's been advocating for it for years now. Nothing new
Ppl remember... there is no limitation on that dear.
I don't doubt that they remember, I'm simply saying that to argue that 30+ years later he can't change is wrong.
While 7 years is a long time too, the republican's stance is rooted in hypocrisy and screams big pharma lobbying. I could be wrong tho?
Support Lynsey Graham? How can I support someone who doesn't understand how to support the American people?
You called him out on the insurance companies and made him eat his own words. We don't need them.

#MedicareForAll !!!
Hypocrisy is not a negative trait anymore, and if it weren't for people like you I would attach this attribute to all Americans
. In 1990's #Bernie wouldn't support #SinglePayer #HealthCareDebate
One of the reason I loved this woman. She cared about us enough to research RESEARCH how to serve us the best healthcare. #ImStillWithHer
#StillWithHer
Both bills are crap, and for the same reason.
Explain? Genuinely curious
We are over $20,000,000,000,000 in debt. Both bills are paid for by borrowing from our children.
Healthcare makes up a very small fraction of the annual budget, plus the ACA had a tax plan to help cover it
Medicare is $600B, Medicaid is $400B. The ACA is $180B. That is about a fourth of the $4T spent each year.
Shame on you Lindsey Graham!  This bill and process is beneath you!
Lindsey Graham is being a hypocrite. Congress needs to grow up and learn to play well with others. Bipartisan is what we Americans want.
Unbelievable how these two-faced #politicans work. $$$$$$$
Hypocrites united #minimitts
ME & AK have 2M residents combined. Yet these 2 senators are deciding wether to steal healthcare from 30M other Americans. #GrahamCassidy
Miss Tim Russert!! He would have had this, "PLAY BACK THE TAPE".  He kept politicians honest or he called out their hypocrisy @MeetThePress
Yes Chuck Todd has completely ruined Meet the Press I can't even stand to watch it anymore with Chuck Todd in there

Who won the Healthcare Debate?

@CNN Save #PuertoRico #PuertoRicoRelief #HealthCareDebate #TakeAKnee #earthquake #GrahamCassidy
MCCAIN, COLLINS & PAUL RAND!! 
we need to use this language against him now...#GrahamCassidyBill is SLEEZY
Unless he's a paid Koch sucker!!
@LindseyGrahamSC  #SleavyGraham is that a milk mustache?
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie... we expect no more consistency from Graham than we do you. Your politicians. It's your job to lie, apparently.
Lindsey Grahm is a fraud.  Bernie Please keep fighting for single payer, get insurance companies off the dole.
A republican contradicting himself?
Time for an aggressive push for #SinglePayer
Donald Trump says Universal Healthcare is necessary to make America Great Again @SenSanders #MedicareForAll Retweet!! 
Now we know there is not ONE Republican that we can trust.  NOT ONE!
yeah,Graham would rebel against buying votes when his whole career is selling his vote.who votes for these c_nts?
the GOP will use any excuse or tactic to push their agenda, they have very little integrity imo, and their big donors reward the sellouts
If Republicans want to repeal Obamacare, fine, but so long as its replaced with MEDICARE FOR ALL!
What could have changed since 2010In 2011 a Big Pharma co. was indicted for donations to Graham  https://thinkprogress.org/major-lindsey-graham-donor-indicted-for-illegal-campaign-donations-and-embezzlement-32656c73cf3f/ … via @thinkprogress
@LindseyGrahamSC you already have the answer - listen to it above- Vote No on #CassidyGraham. Senator Lindsey Graham said it is a #FRAUD.
Hypocrites
ONLY 20% of population like G-C
2010 lindsey graham would probably try to go down on 2017 lindsey graham
Speaking out both sides of your mouth, eh? Guess KOCH didn't have BIG on table in 2010!!!
I love that you actually threw another Senator under the bus.  Graham deserves mocking.
Bernie-in my family we call this be "Russerted".
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy No respect. Cut defense, stop cut for wealthy.  We don't need such a large military industrial complex!
Amazing how $3M can buy a guy
Just fix Obama care!!!! Make it work for the American people...you have health care  RIGHT...do the right thing!
https://youtu.be/jmKzQwriRAs  Worldwide Satanic Pedophile Ring exposed! #SaveTheChildren Hey Bern, please expose the pedophiles in our government.
*laughs* Graham never said he wasn't a hypocrite.
How can you tell when a REPUBLICAN is LYING ?
"The process that led to the bill was sleazy." Sound familiar @LindseyGrahamSC ??!!
Well...Well...Well What hypocrisy!
Man, that video is brutal.  @LindseyGrahamSC needs to go find a burn unit after that.  Good thing the GC bill hasn't passed yet.
@LindseyGrahamSC until this bill I assumed you were a friend of the American People & a #TruePatriot Now I have to withdraw that assumption
Bank fraud Bernie
With all due respect this clip would be 10x better with an over-dub of Joe Dirt asking for fireworks at times
He is Koched up
At yet republican votes will eat this shit up because off their uniformed paranoia about words that sound like socialism
Well if it isn't SELLOUT Bernie Sanders!!!
Let's give the states block grants for defense, they can decide how to spend the $700 billion.
@LindseyGrahamSC is that not you from 2010 or is a fake video attacking you??
@RemasaurusRex rem bern callin him out
#POS
I love a fact-based "gotcha" from the same source.
what the hell is he on ? He look high as hell
Reason we are here is your fault, you help elect The clown, support the Democrats stop being a traitor
Once again, these people will say anything to get what they want. For Graham and Cassidy, they have no shame and no integrity.
And nobody in America supports socialist communist pics go away if you awful un-American
STICK YOUR "DEALS" WHERE THE SUN NEVER SHINES. THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE WANTS REAL HEALTH CARE LIKE 80% OF THE WORLD HAVE
The epitome of most republicans
That because he sold out to his donors.
Boy. You sure like to add to the division of parties, instead of trying to work together...
Doesn't it make u sick 2ur stomach that taxgo 2make this gang rape fantasy writers videos,run 2twitter accounts,Facebook page & radio show
Well, apparently the check just cleared. He's on board now!! 
Talking about disrespectful & disgusting u politician will tell us anything.  WoW
But 7 years later he is.  Evolving his opinion.

#DearMrPresident #MAGA …graham was against it before he was for it…
Just goes to show how easily they are corrupted by greed. How much money would Graham receive from donors if he passed bill? Always greed.
Why are you a backsliding shill for the dems? What do they have on you?
To @LindsayGrahamSC bipartisanship means that Charles & David Koch agree with each other.
Now Bernie... show a tape of all the lies fed to the Americans people before you forced Obamacare on us #Draintheswamp
Hypocrisy
Lindsey Graham...he sure is a pretty lady.
Hypocrisy, thy name is @LindseyGrahamSC
These guys are cons. Get rid of them. VOTE! !!!!!!
We all now well know Repubs do not walk their talk and wotk for the wealthy
Bernie, Obamacare has no bipartisan support. It was designed to destroy the private insurance and healthcare market. Single payer sucks VA??
When will these guys get that they have been on tape for years
.@LindseyGrahamSC This is the prob with you and the @GOP u r all #Hypocrites #Liars  WATCH THIS VIDEO to see your 0C  comments U R #sleazy
All these flips and flops so they can feel like they've squashed the legacy of a black man. Disgusting.
"Ignoring the American people is #arrogance on steroids." @sengraham2016
Will they go on Graham Cassidy instead of thier healthcare
Oh forgot they have more money then most Americans
Unfortunately in 2017 he will for recampaign money 
TKO! 
Daaammnn!!! 
Lindsay's got no choice bc his donahhhs have come knockin... #SinglePayerNow
What a pathetic hypocrite @LindseyGrahamSC is WOW!  SHAME ON YOU
@rabbeni_kim the is a "Hail Mary" bill a last ditch effort 2 pass anything no matter how crappy it is... desperate.. pathetic
They are very desperate #MedicareForAll is popular including among their own constituency I'm not sure how they think this will help them
Ppl won't be happy Passing this would cause them a lot of trouble in 2018
Check this out, @sengraham2016!
Why I do declare Senator.  Who is sleepy now ? #GOPDOUCHBAGS
How many people approve of Graham now anyway? @sengraham2016 Not as nice as he pretends to be.
Hypocrisy at its finest.  Money has a tendency to corrupt. Graham takes plenty of money from big pharma

I don't think he likes it now
Graham and Cassity were lying their heads off on the debate tonight. Bernie didn't help anything.
How soon we forget senator Graham. That was then this is now. There's a tweet or a video somewhere out there. Watch what you say. Be honest
Just blows my mind. So much Hipocracy. #thankyoubernie
Nebraska votes to repeal and replace Cornhusker Kickbacks with Hawkeye Handouts #HealthCareDebate #GBR
I used to live in NJ and I'm dam sure I wouldn't want Governor Criss Cristy who bankrupted his state in charge of my healthcare.
Disgusting hypocrite...piss poor leader and overall liar.
#BankruptBernie bankrupts a collge. Now he's targeting the U.S. #ScaryOldFart!
Talk about hyocrisy! 
party line vote? it's called scrambling, in my book of politics.
Hypocrite
Well if that isn't the pot calling the Mary Jane skunk weed!
Bernie still does not know how to access his Twitter 
Thanks intern
2008 Bernie Sanders wouldn't be talking up John McCain
BERNIE! U R the 1 asking for a special deal. Tonight u said "would u consider supporting..." asking for quit-pro-quo instead of fixing this!
money is more important these days to some......
If it were 1994 he'd be supporting the ACA! #WTFGOP
Yelp, and Bernie from 1987 said Medicare for all would bankrupt the country.
We all change. Now most Americans want Medicare for All. Back then maybe not. The thing is: Lindsey Graham is moving backwards, not forward.
Now consult 1987 Bernie Sanders on Medicare for all.
2010 Lindsey Graham wouldn't be supporting Graham-Cassidy. #HealthCareDebate 
So a GOP politician is a hypocrite. Surprise fucken surprise
Lol
Stop, Sen Graham, embarrassing yourself.
vote him OUT!

omg. this is the gif I never knew i needed.

GOP uses the word socialism as a weapon while they pour money into socialist aspects of our gov(Military,Whitehouse trips) #HealthCareDebate
Fake news. So sad.
Douchebag
