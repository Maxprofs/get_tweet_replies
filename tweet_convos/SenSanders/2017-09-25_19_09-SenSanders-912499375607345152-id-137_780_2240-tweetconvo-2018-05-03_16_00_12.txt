He said he would see it. Not that he would pass it.
Please continue your fight for Medicare for all!
130 million people thought Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be a good president. Pardon me if I don't care what most people think of HC
what people like and want in his mind is different from the 99% of Americans.
I wonder what changed? #KochBrothers #kochpuppets #TrumpRussia
He's been bought. After his first dinner at WH with Trump he started singing a different tune. On the second visit be was totally different
Medicare for all is the healthcare bill that the American people like. Thank you Bernie.
We have Medicare here. Also bulk billing clinics where even if you work they will bulk blll. Without Medicare life wld be much harder. 1/2
Yes, if U can afford it and don't buy health insurance,U will pay a levy which will come out when U do yr taxes end of financial yr.Only way
Anther fucking poll.  Seriously, has anyone been polled about Graham Cassisdy?   Or Bernies Plan?  Made up polls are bullshit polls
Then let him and his colleagues produce one.  Uh, I think that's their job...
@LindsayGrahamSC just plain lies.
Here's the thing: a health care bill that the American people will approve of is highly unlikely to receive his support.  He's against us!
Most like the ACA. IT needs tweaking, for now. Stabilization is needed.
Unfortunately,they R doing everything 2 undermine ACA coz it's called ObamaCare & anything with O must go. Some didn't know ACA is Ocare
So why would he put his name on a terrible one?
If this bill passes. It should not be called #CassidyGraham it should be called TRUMPCARE. Everyone & Media needs to call it TRUMPCARENo
That is Single Payer
What's the problem? He'd like a health care bill the ppl like ... Just not as much as he likes all the Koch campaign money. #MedicareForAll
Any thing is better than Obuma care
Here it is, "OBAMACARES"
But partisanship always trumps what's best for the people. American healthcare is in shambles since they won't work together. #Medicare4All
We'd like to see that as well.
the sanders-graham bill pls.....
The donors who are these Senator's principles need to be brought into the spotlight. They stay anonymous while their agents take the heat.
Simple test: if more Americans want a new healthcare bill more than they want the ACA, then vote for it. If not, don't.  #HealthCareDebate
That was before the $400M the Kochs put on the table to repeal ACA & pass a tax reform bill. Money talks! Especially to corrupt politicians.
Maybe if you'd quit lying and spreading falsehoods about bills the may may hear the truth and like the proposed legislation.
He has, it's called ACA.
It's hard to stay righteous when the devil- " insurer's, koche bro, stock holders" want what they paid for.
Stick that poll !!! You lie
Has NO cred. Brought up lie about PP selling baby parts.
SINGLE PAYER IS WHAT WE WANT NO LESS
but, his continued hypocrisy gets in the way because insurance companies are still the winners.
I like #MedicareForAll and more and more smart Americans do too. I might forgive @gop for Trump if they get on board too #notholdingmybreath
Watch what u say republican
That is an easy one tailor your bill according to the health care of other countries. like Europeans, Canada, Iceland etc.
To Senator Graham the American people are named Koch
That and I'd like to see elected officials that I actually like
@LindseyGrahamSC I have a suggestion...let's fix the one we have! #SavetheACA #FixTheACA #WorkTogether
Lying lying lying.
Its what people can afford and take care of their family
Graham is such a liar! And those are loser repeal tears... nothing to do w McC.
More needs to be done to keep drug companies in line. True reform will never happen until you fix prescription drug cost
So would Americans
Well, it sure as hell is not this one!
Yeah, so? What changed his mind? Oh that's right, donor $$$$.
.@lisamurkowski Plz vote against #GrahamCassidy's versions wo full CBO score @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @SenSchumer
Then give us the same insurance we give him
Their learning the art of lying from their leader.
@Mangel2020 @Heretic_Soul
U do know this is a rino idea right .. trump is going to let it fail so the democrats start crying for change!!
Those "People" he meant were the Insurance Companies.
RIGHT??
And 30 years ago you said single-payer would bankrupt America.
How about his.
Real talk.......   This is what proper twitter usage looks like.
That's called the ACA @SenSanders #HealthCareDebate
So you will stop pushing #MedicareForAll and #Obamacare since most Americans dislike them?
Polls again? When will you learn they are meaningless?
You are the top 1% paid for by the taxpayers
And then the rich folk threatened to end his gravy train...
I as a republican absolutely love this bill I encourage and challenge anybody to actually read it it's only a 140 pages took me one day
That was BEFORE he got money from Russia and Koch and insurance companies. Priorities. #MuellerIsComing
#GrahamCassidy is a smoke & mirrors bill intended to fool the American people into thinking all will B covered.Shame on U @LindseyGrahamSC
63 million Americans ( at least ) demand to see 10 years of your tax returns Bernie , shut up til you put up
Blanche is just trying to curry favor by giving new friend Trump a 'Win' because his bestie was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
I want the same exact healthcare that You Cassidy & Linsey have. No less. Or give all congress members what ever ins they come up 4 us.
Funny how @LindseyGrahamSC has made LITERALLY every argument made for Universal Healthcare, but reaches every wrong conclusion. #SuperDunce
I like for American people exactly the same Health care bill like for US congress members
Bernie, it is an absolute truth that the majority of Republican senators will lie, cheat & steal to help the rich. Youre stating the obvious

Who won the Healthcare Debate?

@CNN Save #PuertoRico #PuertoRicoRelief #HealthCareDebate #TakeAKnee #earthquake #GrahamCassidy
#SolidBern
Clearly bernies not responding as he is on tv at moment so...
The ACA?
They insist on not working with democrats to fix ACA. Republicans cannot agree on anything and they out a failed party.
This feels like theatre. The GOP had 8 years producing an alternative. And instead we get these halfbaked horrible "solutions" Provoking bad

But then he showed his true colors and talked about his donors being angry, didn't he? #HealthCareDebate
Lol
I think that Bill's name was Clinton.
Block grants a joke
It's all about smoke and mirrors
Now they want us to believe #TrickleDownHealthCare will work?

Hey #Economics majors, how has that worked EVERY TIME IT IS PROPOSED?
Bipartisan fix to ObamaCare please
Be very careful of them also
In Texas there is no Medicaid coverage for a acute rehab  imagine 27 years old and being told you have no choice but a nursing home.
One we'd really like? Add a few more pages of improvements to the 900+ PPandACA we already really like.
That's pretty dishonest..you know ppl don't actually know what's in the bill or who they even are
It sure as hell ain't the communism u want Stalin
Then why didn't we #RepealObamacare ?

GOP uses the word socialism as a weapon while they pour money into socialist aspects of our gov(Military,Whitehouse trips) #HealthCareDebate
He lied.
We have one, itâ€™s called #RepealAndReplace
I think something has happened that turned Lindsey bad.  Maybe some kompromat or something.   This is isn't like him to be so cruel.
Graham is an ignorant liar...
Yet all we see, are bills that seek to screw the American people, and benefit the rich!
I would like to see a health care bill that we could actually Afford! $20 Trillion Debt & growing by the minute.
I bet he likes the one that gives him and his family healthcare paid for by the people he is trying to deny the same
I'll say it again. 

Drag. Him. Bernie.
Go Bernie
Graham such a liar. And have 50 dufferent@plans with less money. Come on liar. BIPARTISAN FIX
Cassidy looks insane.
Why trust him...soon to fall back feeling the lack of popularity and he will flip and flop again!
*sigh* The forces of darkness...
Lmao 
bc we all know how accurate these polls are @SenSanders Didn't they say u were gonna win the Nom and that @HillaryClinton was gonna be Prez?
Have you showed him yours?
You're a fraud.
Bernie interns working ot
Making friends again, are we? 
 You crack me up! I needed that after today. Carry on!
Bernie ask him about this in public.
This might be the first time that a Senator has rightly yelled, "SCOREBOARD!" during a health care debate. #MedicareForAll
Me too.
Graham lied.
Hes a lawyer that's what they do
To potential for the Trump
He has lost his way.
That's called #MedicareForAll.
You need a cock to sit on
Stop
