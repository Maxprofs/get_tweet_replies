You are a socialist. You ignore the history of the most blood soaked and repressive ideology in history and brag about being part of it. You shouldn't lecture anyone about morals. 
Oh, and socialism always leads to massive pollution so don't lecture us the environment either.
Democratic socialism is a bit different. I mean our country is a bit socialist right now. Think about it, our military, police, fire departments are all socialist programs just to start with. Some things in our culture have to be.
So @whyvotetuesday, I am sorry sir, your argument is incorrect.
I agree with your interpretation of complete socialism, and I agree with your examples in history. I have no desire to become completely socialist, but in your opinion, what is the difference between collective government functions and socialism?
Freedom of private property and enterprise. Recognizing that government involvement is needed only to maintain protection and safety. Then that involvement is as small as possible so that people may do as they will provided they don't interfere with others doing as they will
But it’s not that simplistic, it’s not just about safety and security. In my opinion, we pay taxes for the services that most Americans need like roads and bridges, schools, the water department are examples of things not just for our security.
3-This is never how it was supposed to work, and it works with far less efficiency and freedom for the masses because of it.
I tend to agree with that for the most part, but with more population, comes more regulations that are needed from the federal government to keep things running smoothly. Every law passed had good intentions at the time (not that they resulted in such)
So I take it you are giving up the private jet and a few of your houses to do your part. Or do you just want the rest of us to go without
Love ya
Not sure who it is you think i support that is evil. But there is nothing wrong with making money. I think we both agree is that those who have money should do more for others in need. There are some very wealthy people (of all race) that do good things with there money.
No, you're right. There's nothing wrong with making profit, with free market, or self-determination. No one is wanting to remove those things. We aren't communists. We just want equal opportunity (not necessarily outcome, since that depends on what you do with opportunity).
Join an investment group. Some are small like the one i am with (about 30 people) most of them will let you opt out of some investments if it is not what you want your money to go. There is a risk like with any investment but find one you are comfortable with.
Investment group? As an alternative to something or just to do it in addition to improving existing systems?
Says the one who flies in private jets making money by saying we should “spread the wealth”
Depsite that, he's actually one of the poorest (income wise) candidate out there. Most everyone else makes more than he does. He's making maybe about $700,000 a year as of his presidential bid. Most politicians we know of make more than that.
Oh wow, only 700,000 dollars a year?          That’s SO little
Compared to others, it is. Actually, i fibbed by accident. I misread the source and found that taxes this year report $200,000 between senate salary of about $174k and SSA benefits for the household and any other gains. Sorry. He's not getting $700,000. That might be HRC.
Thorium reactors instead of uranium... cheaper, more sustainable, less waste, just as good. And let's get hydrogen out there to compete with electric and oil as fuel commodities! Keep energy and gas prices down with competition and put the oil barons in their place.

By repealing burdensome regulations and ending Obama's "war on coal," @realDonaldTrump has helped spark a rebound of blue-collar jobs while simultaneously cutting the size of government.
Eeh, I dunno. You kinda have to have coal as a resource in the area to create those jobs. Not everyone has that, so those numbers are skewed by locale & do not represent the nation as a whole. There should be competitive resources to keep fossil fuel prices down & make more jobs.
I was just contrasting the positions. America is starting to be viewed as a global pariah due to its self serving climate actions.  World leader no longer.
let's commit to renewable and sustainable energy along with legalizing cannabis

So what about the HUGE footprint your lifestyle is leaving. Hypocrite.
Ban fracking now! 
Ban Russian bots like you! Putin hates American energy!
So you are for the right to life but you are still killing babies up being born? Make up your mind?
Thank you !
The sheer hypocrisy of someone advocating spending our children's money by massive government debt talking about our children's future...
As opposed to the massive debt we have incurred waging war for oil and gas.
Alas... the U.S. waging war for oil is complete and utter rubbish claim... if anything it was the nations opposing the action in Iraq that did so for oil. But keep trying to perpetuate promarxist lies.... There are plenty of reasons to criticise the Iraq war, but that isn't one
I don’t get why the 1% aren’t forced to buy a giant air conditioner to just cool the planet back down. It’s crazy that they aren’t just forced to do that.
Taxes should go back to where they were in the 50s. If we want the 50's economic prosperity back, then we need to replicate the exact conditions of that economy. That means particularly rich people should pay 91% income tax like they did in Eisenhower's America. (1)
Daddy
Gazans pollute the atmosphere by burning many thousands of tires, this month, but you won't hear Bernie saying anything about it. Why?

#EarthDay18 #EarthDay
It’s possibly because polluting the atmosphere pales in comparison to shooting unarmed journalists and children.
I understand Bernie told you the killed Gazans were "protesters". But the truth is Hamas themselves admitted they were members of their military (terrorists).
Those pictures of killed Gazans were published by Hamas themselves:
The so called "journalist" was a drone operator for Hamas. He admitted it himself in his Facebook page.
Proof:
https://www.facebook.com/yaser.Murtaja/posts/1674297822601075 …
This is a picture from an incident in which a Palestinian terrorist wore a "press" vest in order to get close and stab and murder a soldier. 
Exactly as ISIS and the Taliban (similar culture), Gazans have no problem to use ambulances, press vests and kids to commit war crimes.
And no, there is no justification for Gazans to pollute the atmosphere with the thousands of tires they burned and keep burning each week.
And Bernie should stop ignoring both the war crimes Gazans commit and the air pollution they cause.
How many of those Wall Street investments you have buy stock in Monsanto/Bayer? Syngenta? Come clean Bernie. 
None. How much you get paid to tweet that????
Thank you Bernie. Youre still fighting for even the most ignorant among us and they dont even know it.
Your history of social justice cannot be smeared by lies and propaganda. 
I stand with you 
Agreed; that's why we need to develop numerous Thorium reactors, which have zero probability of meltdown, can destroy weapons grade waste, produce zero GHG emissions, and can produce vast amounts of energy.
Truth
Still want us to be the next Venezuela or Nicaragua?
Never gonna happen. We might be populist, but we will never be a third world country without a war involved. So, I'd be more concerned about the military industrial complex, frankly. Progressive politics will not impoverish us. If anything, it'll make us richer and lower poverty.
Solar should be affordable for all homeowners, imagine literally almost free power?
Yes!!!!
It's almost like economics and reality don't matter.
Reality of what? Whose economy???
You have to buy solar panels on principle for starters, as in money for an exchange of goods, then it takes years to get a return on investment once you've PAID for installation.

Not against solar at all, but solar isn't 'almost free' either.
Agreed, but mine has paid for itself in less than 4 years and reduced my gas bill as well. The positive production of energy also helps since in producing power. Anything less out of my pocket is a benefit.
You admit you paid, so where is the "almost free" aspect to this?
I haven’t had to pay a power bill in 7 months, my gas bill is also reduced by over 60%+...
You don't give a crap about earth day. Stop your lying old man.
#NeverBernie

WHERE DOES PRO CHOICE FIT INTO YOUR MORALS
You mean this anniversary of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's birthday? No coincidence there, either. At no point has a socialist government worked. It's failed in Venezuela, Russia, Germany, Spain, Italy, and many others. It will fail here, too.

Environmental pimps will tell you shipping coal 6000 miles away to make US steel to ship back is green... Largely an excuse to chase indentured labor. A crime to humanity and the exact opposite to "progressive" policies.
Always using the kids for ur screw ups
Really?  Responsibility flew out the door by your bowing to Clinton rigging the primary!  Your communism is not welcomed
Let Us All....
Save Fruit Seeds and Grow Fruit Trees..!! Everywhere..!! Together collectively and both literally and figuratively..!!

Shouldn't you be retired already
Is this why you own 3 houses
Actually, you have to have morals before you can possess have a moral responsibility. #idiotdemocrats
Let’s build a money funneling scheme to get rich on while pillaging the resources of the American taxpayers. 
Your fear mongering is losing its influence. You will be exposed for the fraud you are.
Our moral responsibility is to stop the flow of drugs and illegals into our country. We cannot sustain anything for our children and grandchildren with a $23 trillion debt and growing!
IMHO the only way to do that is with a Resource Based Economy.  @TheVenusProject
Start by eliminating Plastic wrapping don Produce and merchandise! Glass bottles and wax papers wraps used to do well!
Oil companies are sticking it to us again $2.76 a gallon.   Trump again helping them stick it to the Middle Class.
In France the moronic belief that badly managed nuclear power will save the day stands strong. It pollutes the seas and soil, endangers our species for millennia, but hey! No carbon oxides! We are saved! (Moronic I say!)
But who cares? Moneeeeey!!! 
We really need you to be president .It's a disgrace what happened, You should be president now and were robbed of it by Dillary.We must win next election and get this Country working for real people more than corporations that are basically running our country now .PEOPLE 1ST
Yes and for access to clean air and water would also be great, we are depending on you guys @SenSanders
Yes! Thank you.
You need to discuss Earth Day with @SierraClub Bernie... they just endorsed DWS who takes monies from Fossil Fuel industry, doesn't oppose the Sabal Trail Pipeline and supports Fracking.
Yes let’s show Mother Earth she deserves our respect
@realDonaldTrump What solution is there for plastic particles polluting our ocean, plastic island in the pacific, put a team on it!
Start legal actions so this responsibility be codified in a way that can not be rolled back by any future official looking to boost or protect oil companies interest. This should be the ultimate goal!
Blessings from Christ Circle of Life for sharing the truth...
Blessings as well by getting back within Christ CrclofLf lw's laid out in New Testament printings before 1950 of where Sen Sanders comments generated, corresponding with...
What do you mean OUR moral responsibility? You mean PAY for world's problem or make world do what is right. Please clarify...
Thank you for remembering Earth Day. @SenSanders. Yes. It is our moral responsibility.
#EarthDay
Let's get off the oil. Period.
how do you expect people listen to you after you pulled a Ross Perot move on them?
But Bernie voters really weren’t Democrats, did you forget your Correct The Record talking points?
Sam Trans buses say Earth Day Everyday.  That is how it should be.  I have solar on my roof but PG&E limited the size due to my frugal use of electricity in the first place.
Bernie you’re a champ!! See you in 2020!!!!
I ran a pint of Lake Michigan water through a Brita filter and poured it back into the lake.  What did you do?

On earth, I celebrated by cutting my grass with a gas mower, hooking the boat trailer up to the truck, driving 3 hours to the lake, and then burning 30 gallons of gas through a big V8 boat motor. Got to love it.
To that, I agree with u sir! N anyone that sees my responses to you know that never happens
Yes, let's get sensible enough leaders from all US states in office to do such work. We need younger, smarter, and more visionary Congressional leadership.  Not greedy, corporate, war monger,  self-interest,  followers of lobbyists.
Didn’t the creator of #EarthDay, Ira Einhorn, compost his girlfriend in a trunk? This is your guy, Bernie? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Einhorn …
But whatabout his 2 mansions REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Let America businesses keep up the great work keeping America clean.. Thank you President Trump.
Someone needs to comment you, you old Socialist fuck.

I just love the people that say climate change is a lie. Why are the ice caps melting at an alarming rate because we do have climate change
And your 3 houses use how much energy?
.@SenSanders please consider researching into .@ZeitgeistFilm #UniversalBasicIncome and .@TheVenusProject all areas of this research which you will find are connected, will lead us into a great, sustainable #future
it's hard...with garbage in the WH.  :(
God bless you
It's also your responsibility to stop nsa cia and other agency's mind control programs. This nsa handler that operates this technology is also selling the info of this technology to other country's so he says but I do know for a fact what he says about mind control is true.  Why?
Hello
Thank you Sen Sanders for never losing sight of ALL the American peoples’ quality of life.
You are so right more solar wind and hydro. Thank you Bernie and you have my vote. You speak for me and I appreciate that. You base what you say on facts and truths with proof. Thanks
Let’s commit to having less kids; to avoid the consequential pillaging of Earth’s precious unrebewable resources and reduce the impact on biodiversity. The carbon cost of having kid is incomparable to everything else.
If people thought they were going to live to be 1000 years old would they still treat the planet as if it were a disposable? I don't think so. Let's start walking the planet without leaving our foot print.
Tell me...what is the optimum temperature for earth?  It's been both warmer and colder in recent history
Let's make EVERY Day EARTH DAY!
Tweet of the day (for me).
Since when were you about morals Mr. Sanders? You pledged into the Dem party and left as an Independent over sour milk. Never released your taxes, fooled young voters. Don't preach to me about morals for our earth when your deeds helped elect the worst EPA guy in history!
G
Just heard you're against legitimate pain management. So I no longer support you. Thanks for that.
Yeah blah blah blah

On the #earthday how about you juat retire
I know your ancient, Do you travel from Vt to DC via horse? If so do you ensure all your Royal horses are feed non-GMO feed?
We can all stop global warming if we add 1000 solar panels to each school.  Together. YouTube: paul8kangas. PK 4 SF Bd. Educatio
Yes it is.
So, Thorium breeder reactors it is.
This
It's far beyond moral at this point, it's about surviving now
Oregon Democrats just psssed our 2018 platform, which calls for a 100% transition to renewable energy by 2030. @ORDems
We will know their for real when @TomPerez pisses off his BIG PHARMA sugar daddies, and annouce their pushing for Medicare For All! And one more thing #EndSuperdelegates
#EndSuperdelegates
I commit to burning more fossil fuel to help grow the forests and support those animals that depend on it and thrive there. I commit to assisting others to burn more fossil fuel to lift people from poverty and remove slavery from the world.  Fossil fuel is a gift to humanity!
I have asked Sinclair Oil Company to be the first to supply nothing but safe  alternatives to gas.  They are Americans, they may.
We can help save the earth by limiting socialist asshats from owning more than one house.
Your moral responsibility was to stand up to Clinton for your nomination. Especially after all of the proof was laid out for you.
That's why I'm voting Green.
Unfortunately this planet will die. No sense in prolonging the agony of dealing with politics.
By buying oil from other countries huh. Democrats are such idiots.
The automobile industry is changing to electric and hybrid vehicles. Not just because of the green movement but because the cars are much better and save people money. Let's keep pushing for green but let capitalism make it happen not some gov't program.
Gates building a safe restored in CHINA  We could SHADOW build in the US  PS it will use depletes uranium #Stockpiles
Let me guess! If we send all money to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren there will be no more Climate Change!
On Earth Day Let's all remember to label our breaker Boxes. Shut off when not home.
Reduce your Carbon Footprint!
#EarthDay
It's easy to save mother earth. Just pass NATIONAL 100% FULL NET METERING for all distributed / rooftop solar electric  panel installations
#NoDAPL #StandingRock
I taught my (now adult) kids from an early age that earth day is BS and to celebrate we always burn a little styrofoam (to demonstrate that man couldn’t destroy the planet if we wanted to). Proudly they still do it to this day. #EarthdayIsBS
Now more than ever. Hope it's not too late. Probably is, but let's try, folks.
Too late.
Dear senator, you are a loving brother of all human being generations !
I don't even have children and I desperately want to save the environment
 2018 @SEEDSchematic @OurNativeLand @OurGlobalHeart.
Lets do it
How about we tax only those who reproduce ? Children shouldn't be born into taxes . 
Something needs to be done about the population. 
Without a massive population there is no need to make new laws about the environment. Humans for a sustainable population !
How about limiting yourself to 1 home. Should reduce your carbon footprint, shouldn't it?
Global warming lie trying to fool us again
And how does the death of millions at the hands of socialism fit in to that responsibility? #Communist
What the hell are you on about? How is that at all related to the original topic? How about instead of just spouting nonsense, you start recycling? You can even buy a more fuel efficient car, save money on gas and save the earth at the same time! It all helps!
Morals? Like how your wife bankrupted a college?
@SenSanders .. asking you what is going on throughout the country regarding rape kits that have not been followed up on? Can you shed light regarding your state and the rest of the country ?
Sustainable energy...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant …
Ur jus another trumper ..tryin to hide under Democrats..WE KNOW BERNIE
You got that right, Bernie!
The governments job is to protect & to SERVE! That’s it!
You are a lost lunatic
You have no morals
So Bernie is going to make the decision to give away 2 of his homes because who needs 3 home?
Ok obi-Wan Kenobi.
Our moral responsibility is to save our children from Socialism which killed 100 million people. Is that a bug or a feature? Feel free to reply from any of your 3 houses.
What? Make liberlism a felony? OK. Great idea Bern. @realDonaldTrump #maga #draintheswamp @JudgeJeanine
MAGA
Are you talking to us or the people in power not doing a damn thing about it?
Or we could commit to meaningless cliches.
bernie 2020
How much energy do your three houses burn?  ...or is it four?
Let me guess: you have cronies in the energy industry, right?

And maybe stop the private jetting? Maybe?  You know, if you really care about ‘da en-VI-ro-MENT!
Mr. Senator,  I am with you - Happy Earth Day!
Have you seen what a lithium mine looks like???  looks like a bomb crater
Bernie supports trump
What? Republicans don’t believe in environmental issues. They are running things in case you forgot
Crazy Bernie- it's a wonder you can tie your shoes.
Batty Bernie, prove what you say, build a gigantic windmill on any property you own. Then we'll believe you. One of those big ugly bird killing windmills, and get your electric from it. But your a fraud, so I know you wont.
On this #EarthDay  let's acknowledge the God who created it, the people (all of us) who broke it, the savior (Jesus) who fixes it, and that we need Him

And I wish you had done your part by not running such a divisive campaign.  Our Earth needed help then.  When DT (deadly toxin, aka @realDonaldTrump ) is done, it may be too late.
And despite what Hillary claims, going green by 2030 is completely achievable! #AimHigher
Do us all a favor. This potus is dividing our country.
Do something for our planet and step aside so actual Democrats can elect someone who can restore the EPA and it's protection for the planet. 
Your behavior in the last election was every bit as damaging and egotistical as Ralph Nader in 2000.
senator plz put tump and his cronies in a cell.
Also be a good day for you to release your tax returns
sell your houses and move into a cave
So won’t you man Monsanto and weed killer in Nee Jersey.   That is the key to a heathy New Jersey.
Go Bernie!
Yes go Bernie... GO HOME
No u
You need to ensure that green policies mean quality jobs & lower energy costs if you want the majority of working class people to get behind them. Otherwise they'll continue to flock to the likes of Trump's. So far "green" has only ment job losses and rising energy costs.
To make any changes as far as the environment is concerned you need to fundamentally change how government is run. No change comes from wishy washy policies & neoliberal reliance on private industry to make changes. It must be FDR style state projects that create jobs as well.
Bernie, being a crazed socialist that wants everyone to make 15$ per hr for some imaginary company is pushing the limits, but now claiming to control the climate is just over the rail. too much crazy democrat talk, promising to save everyone from imaginary dangers to get elected
https://dm2.gofund.me/stand-with-intellectual-disability … stay engaged in the world of WORK!
If you could get the Philippines, Bangladesh, China, Malaysia and all of Africa to clean their air maybe...  But anything done in the U.S., U.K. & Europe is negated by those other countries polluting the air. Get it Bernie? Everyone must do it together not just us!
*salutes*
Lets get #TermLimits and cut or Federal politicians pay. No way our Senators should make more than teachers, and they shouldnt be millionaires.
Now your running for the Green House party as well? Pick a side already and stand with it.
It should be mandated that all new homes come with solar and wind power subsidized by a tax on the wealthy.
more and more power to you, bernie uncle! Always! hope you keep growing from strength to strength, and hope you some day maybe become the president of  

just maybe, one day, some day 

usa might not deserve you but usa needs you

the world needs you too

#BernieSanders
Our moral responsibility is taking responsibility for our dept and stop spending. Stop illegals from spending our tax dollars and make freeloaders get a job. Force Americans to work harder to better ourselves. Stop identity politics.
With you
I think, in the end, what you're saying, uncle Bernie -is more like:

Lets commit to build a taxable energy future and a taxable planet for all our taxable kids & grandchildren. That is our more taxable responsibility.

I wish the other was possible.
Insha'allah Comrade Sanders
Women's education leads to family planning,  The commitment to overpopulation is a doom rate factor I wonder if you asked the Pope to reverse. 9 billion is the last estimated sustainable number when plastic ocean poison means food chain collapse is happening.
... or, if you're a Republican, "What the f*** are these science nerds babbling about? Here's a snowball."

Don't think Democrats aren't equally as complicit - Clinton, Booker and their cohorts, all taking $$ from Pharma and oil.

Do like Canova. Run Independent, Bernie. Please.
How exactly do we do that
And for the other inhabitants of the planet . . .
Clean Energy connect, solar, wind , cannot take the brunt’s of total requirement of energy use of the world. It is a fix that billions years conserved energy, by the planet , is being let loose with in a shot shorter in past couple countries.
its the only thing that matters
I agree Bernie very well noted for Earth Day
and every day. Let's keep everyone healthy.
All God's Children, Thank You Amen
Good plan, but Trump will never ever go for it !
Earth day start by the population bomb fraudster it’s still a fraud.
I agree, Senator!
You could start by selling one or two of your houses.  You know, practice what you preach.  You're like the modern day Al Gore.
Is it environmentally responsible to have three homes? I'd say no. If I'm wrong, please inform me.
So Hillary getting money from Oil Rich Saudis?
Wise man
I'm getting tired of leftist like you using the word "moral" in your statments. Traditional moral values are based on Christian values and doctrine. You party is trying to redefine it's meaning. Your party backed HRC, you have no morals.
Manipulate of gravity is the only energy source with out end
That’s because gravity is not a energy .
It is a force. Some thing that is energy and has mass does.
The electron found in atoms.
Centrifugal force is what it’s call.
But even centrifugal force is just that a force
The only part of gravity that is real is the electron.
But even the electron is not real .
The plasma energy of the strings that form the electron is real.
That’s what’s real about gravity.

If there's no "under God," we won't say it!
Happy to live in a state like NY with Governor committed to wind and solar energy and the initial reduction of fossil fuels by 50% in the next 10 years.
Even people without kids are trying to save planet....do something...REAL.

Foooook yaaaa sustainable energy !!!
How about feeding some trees your bull shit! Term limits for you and the swamp. And don’t say voting is the way. Crooked process. Does not work.
