Thank you @TeslaMotors & @elonmusk for making energy independence a real possibility for the world. Utilities world wide take note. @LADWP
Is this the same Tesla that has never made a dime in profit?  Typical.
Why hate on @TeslaMotors? What did they do to you? You didn't short them did you?
Don't care about them one way or another.  Just pointing out that they haven't made a profit, yet u tell utilities to take note.
Utilities exist to provide us power, not to profit off of us by building more useless fossil fuel power plants, just to justify high rates.
They exist to make money like every other company.  Without profit, u have no electricity.
Only safe green renewable nuclear can replace fossil fuels.
Sadly, it's not safe, nor renewable...#seriousaboutplausibility
Factually speaking, nuclear generation is one of the safest things we do & it's renewable. Saying otherwise is false http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/ …
Factually speaking, we haven't even managed to contain or use the waste from reactors 'safely'. So...
We manage spent fuel just fine. Long term repository via dry casket storage is & has been the solution.
And you know this because we've been 'succeeding' for a handful of decades? This stuff is a problem for 10s of thousands of years. #tripping
You do realize that spent fuel is only deadly on those time scales right? Humans lifespans don't span 10s of thousands of years.
Only deadly for humans for 10s of thousands of years... and you think that is 'safe'...#tripping #logicvacuum
They will be back. Solar and wind are more expensive and require way too much maintenance to rely on solely
Congrats to Vermont
GMP should allow us to roll over extra solar credits or gift them, the use or lose rule is terrible, dissuades folks from investing in solar
@GreenMtnPower also not letting customers with solar credits put them towards 2 properties is wrong, and impacts families negatively.
Welcome to the delusional world of Bernie Sanders! Socialism/corruption going to fix all our problems! Doesn't care @peasants  just $$$$$$
Yea, Bernie, we're much happier spending TRILLIONS to fund Endless War, Corporate Welfare & tax cuts for the Richest 1%, so hush up!!
Thanks Senator Sanders for your leadership in energy! team #vt!
The new rules around solar credits hurt small solar companies and families.
We will always need fossil fuel's regardless!

Your visit to Rutland #vt to see GMP’s Stafford Hill Solar Project that uses battery storage was a great day! Thanks for leading on energy!
And the green cult believes these measures will prevent, "climate change"?  
Amen! #RenewableEnergy / #RenewableFuture
This is what needs 2 happen in the coal mining areas Create new jobs manufactoring & installing solar & besides jobs have cheaper utilities
Ya and very high property taxes
Families like mine who own a share in a solar farm/or host solar are hurting due to the new rules.
Not without FEDERAL SUBSIDIES! !!
From the guy who thinks powerball will save us all
This meme is silly. Do you believe everything on the Internet?
This meme is silly because Bernie Sanders thinks it's true, do you believe everything Democrat politicians and media tell you?
23 million thrown off healthcare when nowhere near that are enrolled willingly
Funny how a small state success doesnt enlighten you to the waste and failure of giant federal programs. Shame on you.
Nothing is more efficient and abundant than fossil fuels. Especially with the miracle of fracking
Great news you sent about lessening of reliance on fossil fuels.  Pray this slows climate change & creates jobs.
#BankFraudBernie
What you guys want is candle power.


Just keep ignoring the fact that we need glass-steagall and all corrupt prosecuted Awan Brothers DWS Hillary included
Crazy Bernie is a useless, worthless fossil the country needs to transform away from.
Still feeling the Bern.

Top notch professional at the job!

check out Scotlands renewables. Model for the future. Bonus? Pisses off the Naked Emperor something fierce!
Never mind that Bernie, why did you vote against Russian sanctions bill???
Is that why we all pay $300 a mo. for elec. no a/c no extras just what we need $300 a mo. and no help.
I suppose fossils will be ecstatic

When are you going to transfer some of your houses over to the homeless ?
How are your legal problems going?
Sounds like they are going the wrong way in the Trump economy.
Hope it's clean. I appreciate you keeping your waste products out of Texas.

After mining the minerals required for batteries, the remaining 99.8% of the leftovers are now toxic and dumped back into the environment.
We have to have green energy for the future and get rid of oil that is contaminating our atmosphere.
Bernie you gotta just walk right in to the oval office and sit down and takeover
Cuba
Can it power Al Gore's 10k sqft house?
Do you spend 32% more on your energy like Al Gore @SenSanders  in your home too?
<3
As we all should.
Bravo VT!  And how about Waste-to-Energy plants to create clean energy jobs in Appalachia for displaced miners
Not clean, not cheap, and not a long-term source of jobs. #nosuchthingaswaste
Interesting that this comment shows up, seemingly, as a response to the senator, rather than to the person suggesting waste to energy...
Dead of summer heatwave, a/c has been on for for a couple of months straight...7 solar panels on a 3 bed house .. power bill last month $0
Awesome! !!!!
And we are one step closer to save the world
by burning coal, no doubt.
UPGRADE AMERICA,RECYCLE AMERICA,
Burlington claims to be 100% renewable by buying energy credits from fossil fuels generators.... laughable.

UHHHH Bernie, who is paying for that transition subsidy? You really are a tax payer enemy. But those lemmings on welfare love that.
It's funny how a lot of Americans are so scared of socialism. Yet they have draft, salary caps.
A lot of Americans are scared of socialism because they fail to realize that we have always depended on it for the country to function.

And Michigan can follow the lead. Let's do this. Let's deliver progress and haul our economy into the 21st century!!
#BigMarkForCongress 
Then expect higher prices and less reliability. When your lights go out this winter blame people like Bernie.
How is the FBI investigation going with you and your spouse?
Bernie ,Jane finished you no wonder why you wouldn't release your taxes I told my wife you were lying
Because we shouldn't have to violate the Iran deal...
Thank you @SenSanders for your continued efforts to end fossil fuels! You are on the right side of history!
Lol we should just start calling it the bernie side of history.
FABULOUS!
The oil men won't like that
