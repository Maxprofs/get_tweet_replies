You are the guy who said it would bankrupt America 30 years ago.  lololol


Convenient that you left out he said unless we change the funding method it would bankrupt the country.
It's still the case, we CAN'T AFFORD it.
But we can afford paying more for Obamacare that covers less people?

And we can afford endless wars right? 

We can, and we will afford it.
We agree on that completely. The wars MUST STOP! I am saying that we need to drive costs down before we unleash trillions more in costs.
MC4A is cheaper than Obamacare with the 4 year phase in and we cover everyone. 

How else do you propose keeping costs down?
40% taxes never gonna happen
YOU'D SAVE MONEY.
How? Just like we were gonna save money on Obamacare
I'll let these doctors explain it to you: 

http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-system-cost …
More choices equal competition, competition bring down costs
Why did they even have these 25 studies showing costs would be lower when they could've just asked you to quote 100-level economics at them?
You sent me a link from a pro national health care site. I have good insurance right now, why should I pay more in Taxes for worse care?
And you obviously haven't read anything in it. You'd save money.

It WON'T happen. With ONE more supreme court justice, which is highly likely, Roe v. Wade will be gone. Reality is a b*tch.
They are already defunding and closing @PPact  clinics at a devastating rate. We let employers not cover IUD's because they deem them
No, it's not, it's reality. Something Bernie supporters seem devoid of.
Vile? There are very VILE consequences to living with your head in the clouds. VERY REAL, Deadly real.
Does that mean you and other Senators will be throwing in the towel on your own cushy little healthcare plan you packaged for yourselves?
Bernie Said it would bankrupt America
-- Next, they demand we must all be microchipped for ID/health records purposes, also be necessary for receiving dig. benefits.
But where will we get the money? We just spent the last of it on more war. 700Billion for war but not healthcare? Do I have that right?
It wouid a great first  step for all congress to go into whatever the  plan is . Such a move might restore trust
AND WHEN YOU STATED IN 1987 IT WILL BANKRUPT AMERICA..WHAT IS DIFFERENT NOW? MORE GRANDSTANDING FOR VOTES IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
No
deficit plus unfunded liabilities near $100 trillion and this is a socialists idea to "fix things" smh
Yes! As a native west virginian so many needs not being met. Health care is a human nright.
Cause Medicaid, the VA, and Medicare have such great track records.  Get your shit together first....then preach
Rather than the alternative #CassidyGraham proposal that will kick millions of Americans off health care.
No one gets kicked off they're just not forced to pay
As a licensed insurance broker I support this proposal. Medicare works well for 65+ with affordable options
does Medicare not have a near $50 trillion deficit in unfunded liabilities? Tell me how it's working well?
Everyone contributes to the system but with the baby boomers generation the system became overwhelmed true quick fix to that
Well since you have been in the Senate and Congress for decades, seems like maybe u could have accomplished that or anything! But you havent

I respect Bernie he fought against segregation he cares about everyone vote Bernie for president start now
He gives about as much of a shit as Obama did
You tell them bernie
-- This is what's implied by the open star, the witchcraft of being remade in the image of the beast, into a hybrid, a chimera.
Totally agree!!!
I think that the people are slowly waking up. Good for you! God bless!
@SenSanders u won't be happy until government will tell us what cloths to wear
The idea of Medicare for all is nice in principle, but when enacted, it won't work, also it would kill the economy
-- the 12 strands of your dna are systematically replaced by the 13th zeno strand, which is the initial work of the bots.
-- The fiat currency will switch to digital, so you can't buy anything w/o it. The chip switches on the nano- silicate bots.

-- I just got my "senior" Xtra strength flu shot, u aware the "extra" is nanobots, approx. 1/100th the width of a human hair.
-- given the nature of the global takeover, it'll happen, but still be "healthcare for some".
it is time for Health care for all and a  President Bernie Sanders; we needed that and deserved that yesterday and tomorrow until 2028
Because socialist styled Healthcare works so well in which country?
But, in 1987, said that single-payer would bankrupt the country.  Are you a liar now?  BTW.. Enjoy the next 7+ years of @POTUS Trump.
Really? Are you seriously still chanting this phrase after you decided to support Hillary - after you got whipped by her? Give it up!!
Hillary wants single payer healthcare too!
She is cracked like Bernie! They belong together! He got what he deserved after he turned on his supporters!
Hillary hates single payer. Her words in Iowa: "single payer is never ever going to happen."
I am not concerned about what she has said or will think or say in the future. She is "dried up"! Thank god we are through the Clinton Era!
Agreed. Clintons have always worked for insurance industry. Kept us from single payer. Too bad Trump is bought too.
Hillary wanted the single payer when Bill was President... they wouldn't let her run with it!
And could have been if Clinton was president...
You do know she fought for universal healthcare and coverage in the '90s and may actually know what she's talking about...
What about the tens of thousands working in the insurance companies? My partner being one of them. They'll be out of a job.
Good!
Ya since all the government run systems are so efficient.
Getting health insurance through employer has run its course. Makes no sense in today's job market/economy. It's time for single payer
That is because Obama care penalizes employers
In my opinion That has nothing to do with it. We are in an ever changing job market. Lay-offs, mergers, closings. Job security doesn't exist
Companies make profit by laying people off. Gig jobs. New start-up opportunity. Health insurance through employer stifles everything
It no longer makes sense for employer to cover employees- too expensive. It no longer makes sense for employees to be tied by Health Ins.
-- once activated, the zeno dna is replicated by the bots; your dna is unzipped, & the replicant segment zipped in place.
-- the bots, formerly called buckeyballs, are like 8-sided buckets, w/one panel open, so the zeno dna & flu meds go inside.
Nothing is free. We will pay one way or the other..
Yea but decades ago you claimed it would bankrupt the country
He said that if we implemented Medicaid-for-all with NO OTHER CHANGES, it would bankrupt the country. Or can you not read?
…Paging Bernie Sanders

#DACA #DREAMers
Medicare, AMERICA'S UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Photo op addict #SaveACA

They stop telling the medical supply company and the pill company the overcharges and Rich pay their share taxes we can't afford MC for all
prove it by making medicare/VA better than private healthcare
Govt runs all things poorly, not convincing
You even said it would bankrupt us! Expand YOUR Federal Health Insurance for ALL and competition between the options will keep prices down!
So we would be broke already , your ultimate goal. Oh how's your wife's bank fraud case going , Bernie ?
Why can't you have a system like Aussie Medicare (for all) funded by our simple + transparent Medicare levy, with a parallel private system?
Why is it so hard for the US to do what every civilised country is easily managing?

This is what tiny, "poor" Bhutan is doing for its citizens (91% are happy) - free press, good education system, universal free healthcare
He's so much more than an idiot. Pretty sure he has meds he's skipped taking for a while now
Bernie you have been D.C. for how many years and you still don't know Washington can't run anything profitably
Goddess bless you, my man.
Government spends 2/3rd of all healthcare spending in the US to cover 1/3 of the population. Employers cover 2/3 & spend 1/3 of total costs
you're high . .
Of course Medicare For All will be difficult.  Nothing worthwhile is ever easy. The majority want it.  The majority must NOT be silent.
Like the idea but it will never pass...
Insurance for all would allow for control
Of health care cost
If a poll were taken of voting citizens if asking if payer insurance is best 68% to 72% of citizens would want single payer insurance
Thanks to Nixon who introduced the Neoliberal agenda of deregulation and privatization
Decades ago you said,"single payer system will bankrupt the country". Tell us,are you trying to finish the job that obama started.
Wkd in medical billing for yrs. Medicare pays doctors best. Accurate. Fast. No hassles. For profit health insurance is motivated not to pay.
Americans are afraid of anything new-even if it helps; Dems pathetic skill in pursuasion: Rethugs know how to frame an issue megatively
Vomit 

Senile old man speaking gibberish
We tried that. The VA is a mess. Has been. #1 question, I doubt you will ever answer is, will congress use the same system? Doubt it
evitar interceptadores liberar caminho quando alguem queira chegar a um lugar que foi convidado por exemplo
In a minute we are gonna be saying..."looks like it's Healthcare for none"!  Horrible timing!!!
Decades ago you said "it will bankrupt America" So which is it? U R a career politician that is now a millionaire.  Term Limits. DTS
single payer givnt run health care will bankrupt this country while expanding govnt control of amer lives.
#SinglePayer Bernies Dream for YOU
We could've beaten the UK nations to the punch on #SinglePayer by nearly a decade when #SocialSecurity was founded, and again during... 1
...the Truman Administration when NHS was founded, but both times thwarted by the AMA and predecessors, of all things!
Agree 100%, & Thank you for fighting for what's a right. Must stop this GREED of #drivingupcosts
Unfortunately, you are single handedly the reason that Obamacare is going to be repealed. Your timing on this couldn't be worse!
Weird, I recall you saying if every American was on Medicare, it would bankrupt the country. Pay your bills you socialist loon.
do u have a video like this http://bit.ly/SSmith4Health 

There is NO excuse for the US to not provide insurance for all!
