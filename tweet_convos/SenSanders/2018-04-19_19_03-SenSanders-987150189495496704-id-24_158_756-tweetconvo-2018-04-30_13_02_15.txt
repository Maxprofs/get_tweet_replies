I was at the HKonJ rally in 2016 when I heard Rev Barber mention Bernie for the first time, in a less than positive way due to an unfortunate staff misunderstanding. It is wonderful to see them working together now.

Bernie Sanders is an excellent politician,he brings considerable issues to USA and http://citizens.It  can't be citizens and US government view differences ranges of long,little bit should be accepted.Such strong,productive economy as America hold,less government would help.

Bernie Sanders is more or less following African Americans around trying to get photo ops with black people.

This is some sad pandering shit making these photos look so obvious and awkward.

You the employee pay for 100% expenses of 4 group classes NO MATTER how one labels it!

One thing is clear, Republicans are dead wrong on EVERY issue. Wrong on womens rights, gay rights, climate change, min wage, paid sick leave, immigration, gun laws, tax policy, military spending, and on and on. They must be removed from office! #BlueTsunami2018

That is an amazing pipe organ. Spectacular.
