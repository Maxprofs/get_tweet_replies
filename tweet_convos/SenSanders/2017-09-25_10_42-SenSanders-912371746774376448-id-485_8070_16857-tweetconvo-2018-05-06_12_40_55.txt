Who in there right mind dont know they are US Citizens oh y'all President the Donald.when in fact the law dictionary state non-white ppl.
America needs it's compassion back ,one nation under God ,and liberty for all , That's how we make America Great Again
Berni now a parasite loser who lives off the American taxpayer, only a moron or a con man thinks socialism works.
Healthcare should be a human right, and socialism is better than a plutocracy of wealthy donors and parasitic corporate interests.
Socialism is a joke for kids and man children you're fooling yourself and a whole bunch of vulnerable people with your fantasy. Grow up!
Healthcare is a human right, not a corporate right.
But, our society is built on greed, and corporatism, so the people must fight against the old common wisdom and status quo.
No, you're not greedy, my friend. As the system changes, so too will your healthcare utilization.
Pretty sure him tweeting out to his 6.3MIL followers will accomplish more than he could with his two hands alone...
Well you want Trump to do more than tweet ... Bernie should get off his rump and do something with all his money
Lol Bernie do something...but he is a socialist?
We at @IEGSolar can help! We have helped People in Haiti so we know that we can help Puerto Rico! How can we get in touch? #PuertoRicoCrisis
Is President Trump doing enough to address the crisis in Puerto Rico?
Millions don’t have electricity in Puerto Rico, while the President keeps tweeting about the NFL...
Governor of Puerto Rico: "This is an unprecedented disaster… [it’s an] unfolding humanitarian crisis"
A reporter explains the desperate conditions on the streets in Puerto Rico:
Here’s a reporter describing the situation at the San Juan Airport
A lot of people are calling the government out for inaction https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/911984783194050560 …
It's a sin for trump not to have national guard over there evacuating those people. It's murder. They aren't shiny white but they are humans
Does PR have a National guard?
I don't think so.
Donate your salary first like President Trump; action speaks louder
Our government needs to stop tweeting, step up & DO more to save lives! Prioritize!!!
So sad
Send LIFE STRAWS (filters) instead of bulky, hard to transport WATER
News has been focused on NFL, we are sending aid!
With your money or by stealing from the taxpayer?
How can it be both stealing and taxes?  If you don't like it, you can get the hell out of my country.
Because taxation is theft. Why should I leave?  Is this not a nation of sovereign individuals? It's the govt who is leaving the principles.
You owe all the comforts and stabilities of your life to taxes.  Grow up.
The only one who needs to grow up is the economically illiterate jackass who doesn't understand what produces prosperity. Read a book.
Me thinks I'll have a read of some ayn rand. Me thinks I need a brain workout
Read Mises & Bastiat
Puerto Rican’s should be allowed to vote. As sad as it sounds, this seems to be the only way to fix this constant injustice
Perhaps their gov representatives should get out of the way so they can become a state then
Why is everyone suffering .... It feels contrived to me.
Because there is a lot of suffering in the world; how 'contrived', Mel?; peace & love; God bless, Andy 
I just feel it's intentional on the part of our 'so-called' World Leaders. Creating terror and manipulating then weather
Trump wants 2 get us in lock step behind the flag while he ignores disasters. People r suffering. We need the POTUS 2 do the right things.
Trump declared state of emerg before storm hit/1000 FEMA workers were there before it hit/while you were complaining things were being done
What personally are you doing Bernie to help the people of Puerto Rico?
Are http://citizens.black  folks aren't even citizens in the US.but who built this counrty #OOOH #BLACKFOLKS
That's some fake looking news.
Not really. Mother Nature did that. Recovery is going to take years.

https://youtu.be/qArZGwtRINg  should be 1000 of these in Puerto Rico @NPR @AOL @TwitterMoments @facebook  #PuertoRico #MariaPR @TwitterMoments
Please Join @SenJohnMcCain on asking @DHSgov to waive the Jones Act
How did you squeeze in this non-Obamacare tweet?  Are you ok?

Why haven't you did anything but sit there with a bullhorn. All talk, no action
Very disturbing & frightening.
Trump has priorities like bitching about the NFL.
Wish I could do more. I would totally donate more then money.
Sad.. instead of helping those in need 45 tweeting foolishness
Thank you, Sen. P.R. and Virgin Islands need help now and for many months to come. We need boots on the ground.
YES!!!  American lives are at stake!  People are starving, thirsty, unsheltered, and dying...and POTUS is campaigning!!   REPULSIVE ASS!!
Does @POTUS know where Puerto Rico is.  He seems more focused on NFL and his buddies getting rich in Africa. When do impeach hearings start?
Can all of the States send extra National Guard to help ?
Well said, Senator.  Pls tell your GOP. to get to work in thus instead of trying to pass a horrible health care bill
This was where we lived, Humacao. Many many friends still in #PR PLEASE DO EVERYTHING TO HELP. IT'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS #PuertoRicoRelief
We have a warehouse with relief supplies from this past weekend but @JetBlue refuses to ship to PR. "It Costs Too Much". REALLY!!!!!
Thank You Senator Sanders for your continued humanitarianism and inspiration to America. You are my hero 
Exactly but our moron of a president is to fucking worried about some NFL bs!!!
The US government fails us right here closest to home.
Why couldn't you be the president?! They are Americans in need of help!
I kinda wanna know what happened, I'm not a Bernie supporter but I'm positive he had a better chance the Hillary, wonder why he dropped out?
Strongest storm to hit the island in a century, and climate change is setting the stage for more like it.   https://www.facebook.com/groups/MomsFlorida/permalink/678497689010093/ …
STOP tweeting, go to Congress and DEMAND it.

What are your thoughts on climate change ties to PR & increased storm activity? Please join @CleanAirMoms to fight for clean air and water!
Thank you Senator Sanders
Please help put pressure to have the donations be sent, they are sitting in warehouses !!!!
I have been posting tweets about this all week long,they need help RIGHT AWAY please!
Trump and his designer wife- raced to Texas next day. Trump gave the okay for federal funds for Florida, before hurricane hit. Puerto Rico=?
TRUMP should be ashamed of himself...!!!
Shameful, to let PuertoRicans down like that!!!
They have to pay up first
Not only is Trump a failure as a president, he’s a failure as a *person*.
True , but Trump doesn't really care. Besides , there is football to be watched
Thank you and God Bless @SenSanders. Start by waiving the Jones Act! 
If only President Trump wasn't so racist. Help the Puerto Ricans now! They are US citizens too!
PLEASE SEND HELP NOW!!!!!
Repeat Of NewOrleans all over again I remember how those people suffered and here it is again trumpPromisedMillion$Out hisPersonalAcctNoShow
Totally agree Penny Jo; the people he serves being effectively ignored; shameful; peace to you, Andy 
Not so fast judging the USA. This crisis will take a long time and patience from all sides. Help need to be coordinated but it's coming.
They are begging and dying. Worse than chemical bombing of Syria.
#presidential
Ask the "news" media to give the story 5 minutes so folks can be made aware. The propagandists are busy focusing on crap.
@realDonaldTrump
Yet Flint Michigan still has NO WATER...HUM
As always i perfer live without us help
No failure PR decided long ago not to be a State. PPL squandered all $$. Bankrupt the Island. Yes U.S. will help but not rebuild
But Trump has to deal with this very important football thing! There are black people expressing opinions! It's a bigger crisis!
"Make America great again", right?
700 billion for war. And doodling
There are over 10k FEMA workers down there. Not sure how that = doing nothing.
Then I suggest YOU, Bernie
Fly over there immediately and access the situation yourself
and HELP!
Donald. What are you doing about PR? @realDonaldTrump
We have the navy, marines, cost guard, time there! Quit spitting propaganda!
Takes a little more time to get there than florida
Forget about Florida and Texas!!
I think tRump's "base" forget that Puerto Ricans are AMERICANS #IgnorantTrumpBase
Honestly, his base does not consider them Americans. Just how Sessions stated that Hawaii was a island in the Pacific.
Tis true but some of his base r ignorant to the fact Puerto Rico is actually part of the US and it's shameful. Right in the town I live,
Which I am moving out of 2morrow btw back to CA #TheResistance is thriving & growing becuz of the #TrumpCrimeFamily
Says the failure.
The government is sweeping Puerto Ricans under the rug Republicans don't care because there isn't a large population of white people in PR
DonJuanTrump is busy covering for Ivanka; his property wasn't harmed so he cares zero for any 'general welfare,' and less for Puerto Ricans.
People died in P.R. and not one word from President Donald Lowlife
Bernie, trump doesn't give a damn about P.R. I haven't heard him mention P.R. not once. IMPEACH HIM NOW!!!
i love you
Dont let the frigging Clintons handle donations!  
Remembering #Haiti
What are you doing, Bernie?
Trump somehow manages to fail both the world and our country, he is a complete coward who shows cowardice. #CowardTrump #NotMyPresident
Hurricane Maria pales in comparison to Hurricane Trump who's busy redirecting national attention away from Ivanka Trump using private emails
Your right about that, let's give them some of that money your wife stole from that school, she is being investigated for.
Or set these people free of the Empire.
Bernie, despite the outcome of the last year or so...you continue to be the ONLY political figure talking about REAL issues for America.
Could someone explain to the uneducated lowlife in the Oval office that the Puerto Ricans are American citizens?
http://1.How  many Americans have to die in PR before we give them the crucial aid they need? My God... they have no power,
running out of food fast, no water, How are they going to live until then. Worse yet, what are chances they go thru another hurricane?
Yes in more ways then one. God bless.
@realDonaldTrump #DoesntCareAboutBrownPeople
SO DO IT!  NOW!
What are you personally doing about it a-hole? Big talk no walk.
Don't see you doing nothing 
Bernie? Talk is cheap 
Politics as usual
Please help them.  They have no food no clean water.
Thanks Bernie for pushing the button for care for the brown and black people of Puerto Rico.
but they voted for Rubio in the GOP primary...so Donald does not care.
Override the idiot in the WH and get these people help!
Duh!!!That
Trump is all failure Bernie
We all need to do what we can. The situation is dire in Puerto Rico & US Virgins.  What happened to Trump's America first?
Whacha gonna do, bert? Install socialism? Ask Venezuela how that's workin for em
instead of talking about it on Twitter - DO something. #PuertoRico
The U.S. government is helping, checkout FEMA and NORTHCOM's websites. How many natural disasters this big have you dealt with in Vermont?

Ajit Pai should be fired, petition says before Senate re-confirmation vote https://arstechnica.com/?post_type=post&p=1173483 … @FCC @AjitPaiFCC @cnet @reddit @CNETNews
http://Gofundme.com/895re-rebuild-puerto-rico …
It's real, we are working hard to help..
Why aren't we? Serious question.
Please send Humanitarian AID ASAP since our deplorable @realDonaldTrump doesn't care to do so.
The US wants it a state so they can go in and take the island completely away.
It's the United Nations that are supposed to help Puerto Rico and the Rich Puerto Ricans.
Is it because they are not a state of the USA .
Are you insane? Oh, wait, bots cannot be sane or insane. But s.o. should at least feed them a list of US states

"It's inhumane" what's happening at the airport in San Juan, a nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas told me - they need food, water and fans. 

https://youtu.be/qArZGwtRINg  should be 1000 of these in Puerto Rico @NPR @AOL @TwitterMoments @facebook  #PuertoRico #MariaPR @TwitterMoments
Their brown Bernie. Don't expect this administration to rescue them quickly. This is a rascist administration .
Is it possible to mobilize National Guard Resources to send massive help to these people? States would
 participate i think.
WHERE IN THE HELL IS DONALD TRUMP. FOR GOD'S SAKE THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP NOW, STOP THE DAMN TWEETING AND AND DO YOUR JOB.
Let the nation know about Puerto Rico tonight too
I did not want to think that since i still have family there
They are in my prayerd
Thank you Bernie for talking about what matters most right now.
Gettin' rid of the Jones Act completely is one of the biggest things that should be done.

Trump should be less concerned about those who are kneeling and more concerned about those who are dying
@PuertoRicoPUR @onesarahjones they're Americancitizens,have given their lives for Our country.#PuertoRicoRelief #HelpPuertoRico
What is the government doing?
@POTUS is too overwhelmed by the NFL to remember what happened in Puerto Rico
I guess this is way you are posting this. Shame on you!
How does it feel to do for yourselves? Without USA aid? Without Usa? Period..
The families of the Victims of your Terrorist friend Lopez have been hurting for many years
Congress needs to stop trying to screw people and instead get something passed to help #puertorico
Has legislation been introduced to send relief?
Thanks you.
How about the people in St. Croix?
Well Senator you could sell one of your homes to help Puerto Rico. Better yet have your wife head up the management of relief funds!
Maybe you could bring it to the President's attention. He seems more concerned with the NFL.
Trump very busy trashing black NFLers
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Negligence & incompetence starts at the top. 45 to busy trashing civil right to care for citizens.
Your philosophy is the penultimate cause of humanitarian crises
(2) their votes don't count in a Presidential election. His incompetency will begin killing Americans soon. He needs to go. Soon. #MUELLER
Double standards. South Sudan humanitarian crisis not mentioned.
There's 2 reasons for that: (1) the majority of residents 4 persons of color; and
Senator please help our people in #PuertoRico. Lives are at stake. #HelpForPuertoRico 
Trump does nothing on #climatechange and has his Katrina moment. This was, tragically, inevitable.
