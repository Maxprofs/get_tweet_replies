You are absolutely delusional if you believe what you tweeted.
1. Explain how a political ideology is a clinical mental illness.
2. Explain how democrats as a whole are the "largest terrorist organization".
How clueless can you be? It's because not only is it incredibly discriminatory and biased news reporting, but also that the diversity of news reporting sources will be SEVERELY decreased!
Holy shit, you must be completely brain-dead.
1. All those news corporations you listed are fairly distinct from each other
2. This is the OPPOSITE of competition! Sinclair is BUYING the competition and is on its path to a fucking MONOPOLY.
Your days late grandpa
He isn't late, and it says much about you. It says you're complacent with the programming without viewing the video. I bet you're a title Surfer and get all your answers from there.
Live your life in a liberal bubble. It was on the news days ago. Sorry msn or abc or cbs didn’t run it. He’s a day late and a dollar short. He steals neighbors newspapers! His wife is a felon too... 
He watches much more than that...
I'm sure you know, 
I seriously doubt it. But thanks
Where’s Theodore the trust and monopoly buster Roosevelt when you need him...
This is hardly a monopoly.
Hey at least Sinclair is private and not state-run.

Everyone knows private industry is benevolent efficient fair just and righteous.

Don't tread on me, big government. Sinclair for the win!
Please tell me your comment is satire.

PhD in what name calling? Mature.
1984 at its purest ... crossbred with Fahrenheit 451 ....
Crazy gun culture so maybe throw a dash of equilibrium in there as well.
What they wont tell you is Telecommunications Act of 1996 signed by none other than Bill Clinton brought us here
and yet again Bernie was there fighting against it by being one of only 16 House members to vote Nay http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml …

Avert and avoid false dichotomies. It’s possible for both Democrats and Republicans to be liars. And it’s possible for both nuclear superpowers to lie about Syria (different aspects). F* those power-hungry liars. All of them. They spit on truth to gain power, money, fame.
Bernie Sanders 'furious' over Democratic Party plot to smear him as an atheist

We would all be better together, with both sides meeting in the middle. The left and the right can’t and shouldn’t have everything they want. The middle is where most people lie.
Sure that would create a better sense of coexistence. It’s a reality, because of differences, we will never see. I saw nothing wrong with a good honest hardworking Man being president. Problem with some Americans is the only thing they saw was the color of his skin. 
Horrendous what @WeAreSinclair is doing. It should be repudiated far & wide but how is that any different from @MSNBC & @CNN w/ 24/7 symmetrical Russia Hysteria reporting. Using the same sources virtually interviewing the same so-called experts proposing nearly identical theories
A Dystopian reality created when @BillClinton's Telecommunication Act of 1996 put the bastardization of the news media on steroids.

What No Labels CEO @NancyPJacobson calls the great Centrist progress she and her hubby @Mark_Penn helped to create with the DLC!

@DNC @TomPerez
Its really gross but this is capitalism at work.
As bad as Capitalism is, it's still better than Socialism 

Socialism is good n theory not n practice, it's nothing more than a pipe dream, with Civilization itself comes inequality,Communism, Capitalism,or Socialism, doesn't matter, some1 will be on top and on bottom regardless
That's been the propaganda of the rich for decades now but its not true.
Yes it is true, Civilization itself brings inequality 

Look at ants, u got Workers, Builders, Fighters and the Queen, like i said, 1 on top and 1 on bottom always 

And considering the rich are all in Blue territory, i doubt it
Ants are not people…
Ur missing my point

Civilization brings inequality, not the form of gov. a civilzation has
Why should businesses look much like and function much like feudal governments? Why shouldn't workers collectively and democratically control the businesses they work at?
Because workers still need overseers, managers, Ceo's, Traders, and someone to lead them and tell them what to do 

Also, Bussinesses don't operate like that
We need to make Sinclair a dinosaur.
" BERNIE SANDERS IS NOT THE
                                          ANSWER "
Who then? 

One of the US Senators &/or House members who voted to repeal the Fairness Doctrine, &/or voted Yay to the Telecommunications act of 1996? 
Bernie was in the House * voted Nay to the later

Unbalanced coverage + Limitless Media Consolidation = Sinclair level chicanery
Sinclair THE REAL threat to Democracy!!
Have you never heard many of the talking heads across all the networks and MSM cable news using the same words like parrots?
You're two weeks late on this story Bernie. Try to keep up!
Free press must prevail!
News outlets, whether print, radio or TV, have been repeating AP or Reuters stories for years. No one accused them of trying to indoctrinate people...
We can thank Bill Clinton & his Telecommunications Act in 1996 for the media today. Before that, over 50 companies owned U.S. Media outlets...now it's only 6.
the back of your ear tastes just like one of Bills cigars,
As an American, this was the eeriest thing I’ve seen in years.
This is incredibly terrifying and partial fault lies with the FCC Chairman Ajit Pai who is allowing Sinclair to exceed the number of stations owned by one company.
Fault for this is entirely on Neoliberal Dems Supporting the Telecom act of 96 which allowed the media consolidation. 

Instead of fighting against it most dems sided with president Clinton in support of it. Only 16 house members voted no, can you believe that?
Bernie I'm a big fan, but is MSNBC also fake news because they rarely talk about anything important concerning  working people?
You decide. Watch John Oliver on Sinclair. Not his most recent episode, but 1 he did a few months ago solely on Sinclair. I'd say Sinclair is intentionally pushing an agenda beyond what we have ever seen before, but you decide.
Liberals: Trump is a criminal. 

Liberals: McCabe great guy ! 

Liberals: donate to McCabe 

#IGReport McCabe a CRIMINAL ! 

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder 
Comey & McCabe going to be roommates in prison.
You’re a little late to the party on this one, Senator.
Nah, he was very early to the Party by being one of only 16 house members to vote against the Telecommunications act of 1996 which allowed for the Media Consolidation that put Sinclair in the position to buy up all those local stations over 2 decades http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml …
Interesting how the left is harping on about a prepared statement calling for truth in reporting when all of the commie “nwws” organizations constantly spew out identical lies and the left doesn’t bat an eye.
It isn't identical. Check out Sinclair in depth. There is a big difference between veering towards a side, which I also disagree with when it comes to news, and what Sinclair is doing.
your NATION is an embarrassment to DEMOCRACY - the land of the free is a joke
@jimmy_dore explains it perfectly.
Sinclair = Goebbels
Disgusting. Where's the resistance by the journalists?
#stopthefakenews
You’re a fool if you believe this. This has got to be a late April Fools joke. The only stations that do this are msm channels and liberal-controlled outlets.
K
But FOX news is Gospel.... LMAO
Quit using local news. Use Democracy Now and The Real News.
Is everyone scared they’re going to get “blacklisted “ ? #FreePress #Constitution
Canada has had this problem for a long time now. Postmedia owns just about every local newspaper in the country. They routinely sell article space to their buddies.
You lost the election!!!!!
That promo asked viewers to contact them if they felt they were reporting in a biased manner. Im subjected to more brainwashing attempts from the @AP in ten minutes than I will ever get from a broadcaster’s promo about their mission statement.
#BoycottSinclair
Actually, the answer is the Telecom Act of '96. These Corps need to be broken up, and all the rules Reagan, the Bushs, Clinton and Obama destroyed reimplemented into law.
Out of a Facist playbook!
A day late and a dollar short, Senator. Many of us have been saying exactly these things about Sinclair for months— and posting lists of Sinclair stations for people to avoid.
YouTube + Google + facebook + loss of net neutrality = A handful of  billionaires know what you are looking at and can control it, spin it or stop it. Corporate censorship is global.
they want to turn the news into a smear and terror machine.. to attack people they want silenced and close out voices they don't want heard.!
Do a google search of “Trump + Gamble” and sort by date. Sinclair isn’t the only one doing it, they were just obvious about it.
Don't follow racist Sinclair. Only fake news an one sided reteric is given, not the truth.
Thank goodness that, to the best of my knowledge, we have no Sinclair-owned stations here in Connecticut.
Hillary kills people. Tons
Thank you Bill Clinton for passing the telecommunications act and allowing this to happen. This is some terrifying shit!
Is there no check valve for this type of monopoly?
1996 telecommunication act was a disaster I looked it up and apparently you had the good sense to vote against it over 20 years ago as a Rep in the house
http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml …
#BoycottSinclair
Is that like the Trump administration and Fox News also scripting news?
Unbelievable, I retweeted the people need to know this I hadn't heard of this until now. Just Awful..
STOP Sinclair from buying Tribune. They have proven they are a propaganda machine.
Scary
Made possible in the first place by Democrats --->
Make no mistake the #AmericanOligarchs have been driving the bus since Reagan.
We know Bernie. We’ve been talking about it for months. Don’t you have some Republicans to speak to about an impeachment?
Typical leftwing #Hypocrisy
The gist of #Sinclair's EEEvilll message?

1) False "news" stories often appear on the Internet.
2) MSM outlets occasionally err and repeat them.
3) News consumers should be aware.
4) Truth is neither "Left" nor "Right" wing.

Pretty "DANGEROUS," eh?
Why didn't you hold them accountable, instead of going on their networks giving them any credence at all? Betrayer
Bullish crappy Berny 90% of the media are wild liberals, everyone knows that, shut up and go to hell
This is a highly dangerous world threat...!!

(Uh, they were reading a promo.) If you want to read what the promo actually said and dig into the propaganda campaign launched by Sinclair's competitors as it prepares to purchase Tribune stations, read this: https://sharylattkisson.com/2018/04/04/youve-been-hoodwinked-perhaps/ … https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/984886971859382272 …
Considering the way ALL OF THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA seems to be using the DNC's playbook - day in and day out...does anyone really care if Sinclair owns some more local stations?

Sorry - but journalists have sold their souls to be a part of the story instead of just reporting it.
That is why we need to limit as before with the FCC’s 7/7/7 rule. When they changed it they stated they saw “no threat to the diversity of independent viewpoints in information and entertainment media”. This shows their thinking was wrong and needs to be reversed.
https://sharylattkisson.com/2018/04/04/youve-been-hoodwinked-perhaps/ …
Problem is, Bernie, you are #FakeAssNews
You and Hillary paid them..  that’s what wrong
What happened to the erotica you used to write? I miss it.
You are just like SBG, a threat to the American people. RESIGN!
Sounds like Murdoch in the UK trying to take over Sky. Big Brother is not only watching you but is trying to tell you what to think through multiple media channels that have a single agenda. The world is being taken over in a right wing coup. Don’t let them #Resist
#CryinChuckySchumer
Schumer has blasted Trump & Republicans for knocking the tech industry over liberal bias. Schumer Got Massive Payout from Facebook & Google While Defending them from Trump. Schumer received more than $150,000…
Thats great im tired of the liberal media! Pushing their liberal agenda down our throats!

So says Comrade Bernie Sanders, a 1st generation “American” and Soviet Loving Communist. The same Soviets that allied with Adolf Hitler and together started WWII. THAT! SOVIET COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT WHO INVENTED INDUSTRIALIZED MURDER AND GULAGS FOR THOSE “THE STATE” DEEMED ENEMIES
Omg
Oh, you mean the “same script” as in the same talking points about President Donald Trump ad homonym on all the MSM alphabet FAKE NEWS channels?
Advice from Putin, how to start to build a DICTATORSHIP! This is just sickening!
The answer is that the game is RIGGED

You mean like MSM does? We have radio hosts play them one after another - and you never noticed it before? Try to keep up Bernie.
Yeah, but nobody needs Bernie Sanders to tell them the obvious or what they already know.
BERNIE I LOVE YOU for the way you LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT. I READ YOUR TWEETS WATCH YOU WHEN YOU GO LIVE AND IT HURTS AND ANGERS ME WHEN I SEE THE CRUEL THINGS PEOPLE TWEET AT YOU..
I will not be watching KIMA in my area as they are a Sinclair station now.
So, you're saying Sinclair is the Right's answer to CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS...etc?? Stating a Mission Statement promising Honesty, Objectivity and, fight against Fake News, is a THREAT to America?!
and the same can be said of the Fake News Trash Mags like CNN....
Trump really needs to go with his racist a$&
One more step
Sure reminds me OF NAZI GERMANY
it's not just sinclair
Trump puppets
Fake news was here long before this Sinclair video.  I have watched ABC, NBC, CBS,etc. and they are all spinning their own way.
@BobbiOsborne18 

Actually..No Bernie.
I'm 65 now..grew up watching 'Puppet Theatre' infiltrate Media.
Turned it off years ago!
I know those people who are not looking at you when you're talking to them , you see they are a lack of concentration, obsessing their own mind, and cannot be able to spread their ideas for others to everyone feel happy
Yes, I’m surprised CNN and MSN didn’t ignore the air strike and just report on the Comey news!
We need to thank Sinclair... with everyone getting the same story no one has to think on the issues that otherwise might seem confusing to the average person. 
You're trying to squash free speech you dont agree with. You're a Marxist. All news media today are biased if you would open your ears and think. But of course, you don't like the entire Bill of Rights anyhow.
I've always said that if want the straight poop on any story anywhere, tune in the BBC.
What Bernie. Nothing about our president defending the people of Syria from future Chemical attacks?
Did anyone watch the Sinclair promo? What in it do you disagree with?
Frightening
Bernie is fake news
Hello Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders, I guess it’s very similar to the Dems. cheating in the primary like Hillary getting the questions in advance, or you making up false stories about the one country you hate....Israel
Did you ever notice that ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and MSNBC all read from same script, read the same stories, in order, verbatim. So why the fuss about the other side doing it...hypocrisy run rampant among the intellectually challenged...just saying.
Same from CNN and MSNBC, liar and deceiver. You are only here to deceive and demote us to Socialism.
Are you attacking Free Speech?? So now its the 1st and 2nd you want to control?? Lets see?? Socialist, free speech, take guns??? Offer free stuff to the younger generation for support? Where have we seen this before?? Let ask some Holocaust survivors!!
I saw the story about your wife being investigated for bank fraud.... feel the Bern
This is the biggest bunch of hogwash I’ve ever read!
DT drive to have a gov't media like Putin
Sinclair Broadcasting expanding into American homes 
if FCC chair gets his way would love to be that media ! 
GOP trying to put in the fix for GOP propaganda machines it seems
I don't watch the evil brainwash box.
So you don't watch FOX News?
Cool beans
Old news. Move on
Senator Sanders you are right in the money. They did this to you as well when running against Hillary.
Seriously Bernie try watching the national news.
Yes. We watched John Oliver’s LastWeekTonight.

So Sinclair is the right wing version of the rest of the Mainstream Media? Like a counter balance to the garbage you get on CNN and MSNBC? Cool. At least there’s balance in the force then you communist traitor.
They do this in autocratic countries - China, Russia, Turkey. The "state" decides what is "news" and what is good for the people to hear. In the USA  the MEDIA OLIGARCHS (Sinclair, FoxNews) decide what Trump news to report and not report. Good people must resist Trumps America.
I did. I reminds me when you and the libs get your weekly talking points from your masters
#Yousoldout
Telecommunication act of 1996 with bill clinton? Dont forget that. Minor details.
Bernie voted against it http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml …
The answer is Right-wing and Trumpism propaganda.
Great video.
Wait a second... are you complaining about bias in the media? Talk about the pot and the kettle....
The answer is having a boss. That company motto you said at the front desk job most of us have had lol
Old news
Cut your cable
#PublicServiceAnnouncement
Don't ever get your news from a source who's parent company is a publicly traded stock....

You've been warned....
At the core the true issue with our nation is that our judicial system abandoned the Harvard School of economic theory for the Chicago School theory in anti-trust law.
Sinclair is only the bottom.
The democrats have been using the same shit for years. Give us a break!
Is that why you refuse to give interviews to Vermont news media?
Local news, how about national “news”? Cronkite would roll over in his grave if he knew how we manipulate stories. #cnn #cnbc #foxnews
Time to bust some trusts Bernie!
Your Communist news does nothing but.
Just like MSNBC, CNN, Huff Poo, CBS, NBC....where we just get left-wing propaganda.  Same diff...
Scary and extremist propaganda from Sinclair.
Just Hilarious how much things are screwed up 
Senator Sanders:  Don't these laws apply any more?: (Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914 and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914)?  What to do, what to do?
What I like best about this tweet is Bernie pretending that this isn't a problem for the mainstream media more broadly. Exhibit A below.
Exhibit B.
It should be illegal what cable companies do, bernie. They charge us to watch ads.
I don’t watch this kind of CRAP- especially FOX
How is this service actually delivered ? People don’t have to watch it. If it is forced down throats via cable companies then people should start cancelling their subscription in protest ...
If you did this for CNN and MSNBC, you'd really be shocked at how they operate with #FakeNews.

#LiberalHypocrisy.
How about all the fake news from cnn, abc, nbc and cbs
What's happening on ABC,CBS,NBS,CNN,MSLSD,PBS,HLN...They all take their orders from the Democrat Leftist party and media matters. They all say the same thing 24/7. 
So you're scared that Americans will choose truthful fact based news rather than Democrats propaganda networks?
Gosh, he sure looks like he's reading from a Teleprompter.
Kind of weird how
@cnn
@msnbc
@ABC
@NBCNews
@CBSNews
All use the exact terms given to them in @TheDemocrats daily talking points memo.
But we like them so it’s perfectly cool.
What has happened to local news is the DNC having CNN ABC NBC CBS MSNBC on there payroll so they can control and keep pounding away with anti-Trump It's pathetic how the DNC is concentrated on anti my Pres instead of promoting the positives But a lot of folks r getting wise
And the irony is that while Federal laws do affect us, they generally affect us far, FAR less than the local Govt (municipal and state). We just hear about the stuff at the Federal level, so we have a distorted view of how much it affects us when comparedl
Bernie boy, the fact is, WE DON'T WANT COMMUNISTS IN AMERICA, SO PAY YOUR BAGS SON AND LEAVE FOR CHINA, OR SOUTH AMERICA OR RUSSIA OR WHATEVER, BUT GET OUT...OH AND TAKE THE CLINTON CRIME FAMILY.
SINCLAIR/NAZI COMMUNISTS!
Biased news?!?  Never heard about it before this?!?
This is clearly designed to fool the people.  But they don't fool all of us. We hear the lies and know what you have not done for the people
Here is a video from John Oliver discussing the Sinclair issue.  (Warning there is some language in the video)
u just noticing? that happened during 8 yrs of the Obama admin? Where u been? Time 4 u 2 retire! #senilebernie
Bs. Same been happening  since Potus became President ..
Unreal you libs cannot use the other side of your brains
Plain disgusting
I can barely listen even for the weather now.
Not just fake - Also biased, they have a point
Waaaaa...
Brennan is panicked 

Comey perjured himself 

Clapper leaked to CNN

McCabe fired 

McMaster fired 

Rosenstein in Damage Control mode

And it's Friday
lol whatever moron
McCabe, DOJ Inspector General

Tell me again how the Mueller pobe is  legitimate ! 

It was all based on lies & FBI Corruption
