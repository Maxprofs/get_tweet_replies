Will you be discussing the investigation into your wife's fraudulent actions that bankrupted and closed down Burlington College?
Oh Geez  we got another kool-aid drinker over here!! 
You know the saddest part about this Koolaid drinker? There is a possibility that he is being paid by a pro-HRC PAC. So much for unity.
You're right! There is a good possibility @SenSanders is being paid by a pro-HRC PAC!
You have issues @greedy_bernie
Yes! I have issues with greedy corrupt career politicians like Bernie getting rich off hard working tax payers! #GreedyBernie

To hear Sanders's ugly divisive rhetoric as he continues to divide America. People of Vermont, stop paying this goof by NOT electing him.
Can you explain how he's dividing America?
NO! Go away old man. We care about the Russia story.
Shouldn't you be working for the people not trying to be famous? Come on, man. I may not like you but I respected that you did your job Sad.
Actually he's still doing his job even after the election.
Sorry I missed it

Keep the faith, Bernie. Never give in.
Will you guys joke about the #dnclawsuit ?

Only problem I see... which of those is the audience posed to laugh at?
Yes please!
Why Bern, we want to hear about you and your wife regarding your BANK FRAUD Investigation! Was there a cover up Bern?
Do a show about Venezuela and the failure of socialism.
Social democracy is not socialism.
You hold on to that dream
It's not a dream, it's a fact. UK, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Scandinavian countries. All are social democracies.
Who plays the straight man?
Sanders/Wilmore 2020

Mr. Sanders, I am impressed with your positive energy! I wish you the best!
REally because they are just making stuff up because the democrats did not win; what they thought democrats were going to be in office
This is the first time in 118 days I have felt like I can take my eye off our democracy.  Deep breathe.
No we need a break from YOU!!!!
You have a bullshit meter....use it on yourself
Yea it pegged on ur post. Did ur feeling get hurt? Mommy will make u a hot pocket and make u feel all better. 
Nah. I don't use microwaves because "they" could be listening.

Can you make me one? Maybe your directions will "trickle down" to myself and others?
Was going to ask u same question. Since Bernie supporters cant think for themselves.
Everyone should tune in.
