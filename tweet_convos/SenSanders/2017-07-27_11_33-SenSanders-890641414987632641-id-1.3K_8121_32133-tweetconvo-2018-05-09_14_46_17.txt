You are not entitled to the product of the labor of others.  Ever.  Not once.  Never ever ever.  Everyone who wants to purchase it can.
What about roads? Schools? Safe medicine & food & transport??? All paid for w/ labor from others (all os us, collectively).
Yes.  Stealing sucks at every level.
So you're proposing that we dismantle all roads and fire every cop, fire-fighter, and soldier? Your ideal country sounds like Somalia.
I'm proposing we sell those services.  Profit breeds innovation.
Profit also breeds greed so much our country has one of the worst rich to poor earning gaps
Profit is not to blame.  Public school system is.
I think @TheACCIC is right about health insurance... they should pay for their billion $ cancer treatment out of pocket, the lazy shites
Amen!
You misunderstand. If you think we should pay for our own health care then you don't need insurance. Pay for it yourself
Amen!

Insurance is a middleman scam.
@theaccic we live in a community. Think about it. Sounds like you need to go find a cave on the side of a hill.
A community should benefit from the charity of the members.  A community should never force one to be a slave to the rest.
Oh, brother.
Did you vote for the Democrat candidate in the GE?
Nave you should have been pushing the other cult members to do the same? No matter now but a far left ticket would have had worse results.
Nobody assumes ANYTHING. Lazy??? hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's not a right sorry
And the emergency room does not qualify as access nor do huge deductable unusable policies
@Echo2zs thats the truth!
"Access"=/= UniversalHC, #MedicareForAll, #SinglePayer
STOP SAYING THE FUCKING WORD ACCESS
Everyone has it. Has.
Not being able to get treatment because you can't afford it is not access.
The question is, how can we get the Democrats to adopt this platform when they receive money from corporations like big pharma?
Was it your moral obligation to penalize middle class families that can't afford it?
More than access. Equity.
Its immoral to force Americans to buy heath insurance! The young & responsible carry the old & irresponsible!
Someone else's time and money is NOT your right. That's stealing
The military before everybody and keeps the Homeland safe. Healthcare subsidized by taxpayers does not benefit the taxpayer
Healthcare for all would crush the economy
how can every other industrialized country on earth offer it to their citizens...?
1. We pay for their national defense 2. They don't have 330 million citizens 3. Their economies are crumbling and moving to free market
I support Single Payer, Medicaid for all, Universal Healthcare. What ever you call it, get it done please.
You're saying two different things. "Access" to affordable healthcare ≠ #MedicareForAll
I love how everyone uses the term "moral obligation" when it's something THEY want and especially if it's against Trump.
Single Payer Now!
Then make health insurance a NON-Profit corporation, take out the Greed..
How about a 1 % federal health sales tax & Non-profit healthcare
And if we had single payer insurance they wouldn't be able to discriminate against trans people based on cost. It would be pure bigotry
Everyone already does have access to health care. Anyone who is in this country can go to the ER and receive care.
"access" No. Has a right,period.
You should've supported him vs HRC. Thanks for @realDonaldTrump

You have a "moral obligation" to end the termination of the unborn, hypocrite.
Thank you & @SenMarkey for standing up for all citizens of Massachusetts ! You are a true patriot !
GOP seems to want to protect rich and insurance companies over patients.
My father sold health insurance for 50 of his 78 years of life. I remember him saying in 1978 that if the Gov't gets involved ppl will die!
Everyone dies. The rich die as well. It is SUFFERING we are fighting against.
Please show me in the Constitution where that RIGHT is stated? You cant. because it isnt there.
yes
It's times like this I'm glad my family lives in Australia. I hope you guys get there in the end.
No, you are wrong. amend the constitution if you want it to be a right
Earn your Keep!  simple!
Making someone pay for something is not right. Keep spinning the facts you fraud
False. Health care is not a right.
In what way is it a right? It is a product and service. You dont get to compel people to work for you. You have the right to provide for you
Great discussion. This has been a fantastic example of political discourse.
You two are so blind it is incredible. I hope neither of you reach the P office good by America
If healthcare is a right,  are you personally going to take care of my medicals needs when Im sick?
@BarackObama was correct! Why referance BSaunders? EVERYONE knows this. Stop Pandering to the Non-Democrat!
Notice the word "access" though. How very GOP...disappointed. Access doesn't = affordable
@realDonaldTrump WARREN FOR PRESIDENT !!!
Having 'access' is different than being able to afford it. Universal healthcare is normal in just about every other country, why not here?
This is #BankFraudBernie 's contribution to healthcare #NoCredibility #Hypocrite
You know what would end all problems with the VA? MEDICARE FOR ALL!
WHO DIED AND MADE U GOD WARREN & SANDER'S! DON'T WANT 2 HEAR  A DAM THING FROM U POCAHONTAS! ENJOY THE LAST DAYS OF BEING SENATOR IT'S GONE!
And which part of the Constitution guarantees us the right to healthcare? Oh right, it doesn't.
These days, it should.  With all the poisons these gogt endorsed business fircevon our people, we should all be demanding an amendment
Why won't @SenWarren or @SenSanders propose this amendment then?
Doesn't require an amendment. Constitution isn't the only law book that counts. Example: The Patriot act wasn't added to the Constitution.
Good idea, I'll treat myself and body terribly knowing that I will have other people pay to help me get better. #UHC is a scam
So in your mind, having free healthcare means you can mistreat body with no consequences. Did you lose your self-preservation instinct?
No, I haven't visited the doctor in 8+ years while maintaining perfect health.. Let's give out free car care too... that would be great.
So your are not willing to pay for part of your grandparents care while you are healthy? And what about your kids? You would pay there's..
Then they would in turn take care of you..logic
That's not universal healthcare and exactly why it's a scam. I'm paying for thousands of people's healthcare. Not just my family.
If CAPITAL HILL MEMBERS have healthcare, then everyone should have healthcare at a reasonable cost.
Better: Force Congress members and their families use the same health insurance as everyone else.
Agree. But not for free and the government should not subsidize anyone
Good of you to support him on this now, at least. I don't remember you speaking up last year when it mattered.
Government healthcare really came through for Charlie Gard didn't it! You only want CONTROL not some "privilege". Dance with the devil!
Cared for him for months, looked into all options GOSH is a top hospital. Nothing would have made him better, read the reports
They would not let his parents even take him home to die at first. Too much publicity. Did not care that citizens raised the money 4 care!
That's not the reasonAccess problem and would have to disconnect ventilator between ambulance & house he could die horrible death in process
Take this message to th Senate floor, @senwarren! The majority of Americans agree w you, but GOP only want to appease trump and donors!
"Access to it" Why not just "Have it"
@tracibenbrook @SenSanders it's not a new concept he thought up. Just saying many people have thought the same for years.
AMEN!
It's not our right (rich or poor) 2 be scammed by congress & ripped-off by our government!  Forcing Socialized HC on us is wrong
@SenWarren is a #SELLOUT & We all know it!
Endless Promises & No Action!
You want to be considered a Democrat - Support #MedicareForAll
Look what socialistic medicine did to the baby and parents in England!  No thanks Dem's!
#Medicare4All
Just like a right to a public education, living wages, love whoever they want and be pro choice
You do not have a right to forced service. I guess you believe in slavery.

  WOW. Paul Ryan has been LYING to Senators. They're preparing to pass skinny repeal this weekend. https://twitter.com/rachaelmbade/status/890654011166048256 …
Are we entitled to the same healthcare you get????
Make sure Congress has to use the same coverage constituents must; i.e., 1 of every 15 Congress members must be uninsured.
Welcome to the first world ...
At right under which authority? Bernie's?
Why can't wee the people, have access to yours. Why? Get to work quit whineing
Access is not the same as affordability  ...single payer = middle class gets the bill rich buy good insurance poor to lazy to work
Not by taking half of my paycheck and you morons in D.C. stealing from it..Are you on ACA Ms Warren?
They should lock you up along with the Clintons
"Access"? Bernie doesn't talk about the right to ACCESS you twit, he talks about the right to HAVE it.
BERNIE SANDERS FOR HELPED ELECT TRUMP ALL BECAUSE OF BERNIE OR BUST SUPPORTERS.   YOUR A GOP LOVER.   FACE IT LIZZY
Greed sets the tone of Health Care making it a privilege not a right. Making money is good but not at the expense of a life. United we Stand
Its for sale everywhere. I pay $100K in taxes a year & work myself to death. Still have to pay for it. Tell these lazy winners to get a job
And you had a moral obligation to fight for what was right in 2016.
#GoBernie! #FeeltheBern
so push some bills
Thank you Elizabeth for drilling this in to some very thick sculls.
Laughable how Trump and the GOP have been hating on Obamacare but they can't manage to repeal & replace it. Karma anyone?
I agree and America should be smart enough to figure out how its paid For, like less money into the bottomless Defense budget.
@SenWarren and @SenSanders if you really want to make a difference v making a headline... Govt should use the same insurance as the people.
Where in the bill of rights does it say free universal health Care?  Liberals need to learn the difference between rights and privileges.
Um, no it's not. Healthcare is a service, and an unnecessarily scarce one at that. Try working on *that* problem
ELIZABETH. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. HILLARY'S PLAN WAS OUT BEFORE HIM. CONTINUED ADERATION ONLY MAKES....
The only way a healthcare plan is going to be a success is if it's a single payer type plan.
Will you two adopt me?
If they don't, I will! 
Wow I'm honored 
Than people can get a job and work for it. People want free heslthcare, so they can put money into tattoos that cost a fortune, drugs.
Health Care will NEVER be corrected until government starts negotiating with drug companies to lower costs.
It's not a right it's a privilege and only to those who are US citizens when it comes to healthcare in America !

Yes it is a product it's life or death and healthy ppl can work amazing!
This is simply not true.No where in the Constitution does the establishment of healthcare appear.Your stance would be better presented (1/2)
As labeling healthcare as a societal privilege of citizenship that all people *should* have, and work towards that. The "right" op is wrong.
Access cannot mean have enough money to pay for it. We all have access to Healthcare but we don't all have enough money to pay for it
Healthcare IS NOT a right! Moral obligation is not the same as a right. Why do we have such ignorant Senators?
CONGRATULATIONS  to the SENATORS who gave their voto for that... FIRST HUMAN RIGHT THAT HAS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Sanders is a thief
Says the man and his wife who defrauded financial institutions and private investors in a college scam!!
Yes, you have a right to purchase it. Not a right for it to be provided to you for free. Don't have a right to make me to pay for others.
Say it sister
We live in  a world  where caring about each has gone south. To day man feel like every man for himself and God be for all. How sad!
The end of our country in a nutshell
Love you and the Bern
Life. Liberty. Pursuit of happiness. Health care is life.
How is it a right? Seriously
Have politicians force labor and resources around with politicized guessing.  Sounds great.
We are on to the Democrats who want big government and no capitalism
yes, everyone has a right to work and pay for their own insurance with the exception of the Disabled and War veterans !!
Bullshit!  ACCESS to healthcare is a right, paying for it is a personal responsibility-pay or you don't have it. Not the govs responsibility
Elizabeth, when the Dems win the WH in 2020, be prepared to Repeal & Replace any GOP policy that passes legislation. Good Luck!
We already have access. We need to be able to afford it.
Fine use your money then not my taxes i worked for to give away for free...oh yea our taxes pay your salary too. Better prems the nonwrkin.
The 1% owns the media who want to kill UHC, GOP just wants tax breaks to 1% why do all other modern countries have UHC?
But it is ok for the senate to have special healthcare?
Again... I wish.
Not one single Democrat voted in favor of #SinglePayer in todays #SenateVote including @SenSanders

Vote #3rdParty

http://www.businessinsider.com/senate-health-care-single-payer-vote-daines-amendment-2017-7 …
? This was a republican introduced bill? I wouldn't trust it either
http://Www.millionsmarchingformedicare.org 
i cannot understand why a country as blessed as we are doesn't have healthcare for all of its citizens
It's called money, or better yet "COMMUNISUM" COME ON LEARN 2THINK F
4YOURSELF ,NOTHING IN LIFE IS FAIR ,EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS A STRUGGLE
Morals left the WH when the Obama family moved out.
Lol lol u are joking right
He'll yes. Nd there can't b any restrictions on wat is to b covered
your a true loon! Health care is earned! All you socialist care about is votes! Earned thru work n paying taxes!
You really must study the Constitution dear. It is not a right.
It's not the Govt responsibility to provide healthcare anymore than it is to provide a home, a car, a cell phone, etc. Stay out of ourlives!
Isn't a healthy America a strong America? How do we end up w/such ineffectual "leadership"? Life isn't left v. right. #unrepresentedcentrist
I watch your speeches, the anger, the greed. How people like you preach a free ride, with a real intent of self gain?
Where do we get our rights? What is this belief based upon?
You say that but you endorsed Clinton  instead of Sanders. Clinton said we would never, ever have universal healthcare.
Why isnt healthcare regulated as other essential services are? Power, water, sanitation are all regulated. Profits are capped it works!
Not just access, but, affordable too.
Constitution says nothing about healthcare being a right. You are misleading Americans with dead end rhetoric. Make it affordable.
I call bullsht to that statement . That's just like obama sayin free cell phones are a right not a privilege.  Play up to the welfare voters
@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Americans deserve good #healthcare for ALL. We can't afford less (costs pre-ACA were rising much faster than now!)
Especialy native americans
Why didn't you or home vote for it yesterday then? Single payer Medicare for all? You lie about your race & heritage and now healthcare too!
I'm having a hard time finding "access" in the constitution.  I did find the 2nd amendment that gives me the "right".
Unlike you, I have read the #constitution where rights are enumerated. Nope, health care isn't listed.
This is what u need.. And America can do this better!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDdZCv5v2Rg …

Be brave Liz.. Break the cycle of suffering!
IF you and Bernie had stood by Sec. Clinton from the beginning, we wouldn't be fighting for our lives now. So sad
Each household sets priorities and budgets.  Congress must learn to do this for our country.  Healthcare for all is possible. 
Single payer/Medicare is most the efficient system that covers everyone. ACA SUBSIDIZES INSURANCE PROFITS
Elizabeth right now I have no coverage because it's $900 per month $2500 deductible then only pays 50 percent . It's a waste . Help me now
NOW Warren supports Bernie.  Where was she in the 2016 Democratic primaries when she could have helped Bernie's campaign?
If you keep siding with Sanders and another Dem runs against you, I will support that person in a heartbeat.
Make it all the same. Then senators would have to wait in line like the rest of us.
Let them access #healthcare, with their own #money!
I'm sick & tired of large corporations aiding in the sickness of our Nation and walking away scott free! McDonalds, Coke, etc etc
UNITED we STAND.  Divided WE fall. Vote NO to this.  Bring bipartisan solutions!
Time to flush the toilet in the White House
Why can't we pass a single payer plan?
Yet he mercilessly criticized this very healthcare we are now fighting to retain. If he had just kept his trap shut...
He's helped us get here. Blood will be on his hands.
what about unborn children
Hey Lieawatha, I don't recall seeing healthcare in the Bill of Rights. You Socialist's crack me up. No such thing as free lunch! #freeshit
Being moral is one thing, being forced is another
Yes we do! Healthcare is way more important than many other programs we absolutely seem to ensure get funding...
No we do not, affordable decent coverage people can pay for.
...and? Please Elizabeth, just say it #SinglePayer
1. Please show us where it is stated that health care is a RIGHT.

2. Nobody is ever turned away from a hospital if they show up.
adam and even didn't have healthcare so it's not a right
Dems want government to pay, Republicans want to bankrupt people...but the problem of exaggerated costs persist either way...
Not just ACCESS Senator Warren. DUH.
Americans want to End the Career Politicians and End Obamacare.                                                     TERM LIMITS 
No he is not. By definition it is a privilege. And everyone does have access to it. Someone please explain this nonsense.
IT IS NOT A RIGHT!!! WHY AM I SUPPOSED TO PAY 4 ILLEGALS. BECAUSE U SAY SO? EF U!!!!!
Keep fighting!
Health care is a commodity just like anything that is scarce, your failure to understand that is why we are where we are.
Not in this country it  is not a right
Bernie, I know you and Elizabeth need to keep the ball rolling, but your both wearing out base. Powder getting wet too soon before big fight
Yes! As a slogan for Dems, "Healthcare A Right", we cut into Ts supporters. And slogan, "Fight Back".
everyone had access to healthcare before the ACA, everyone had access to health insurance before the ACA, everyone had choices before ACA
Not has "ACCESS TO", but "HAS IT." #SinglePayer
You and Sanders are old hags and need to realize healthcare is not a right. It is a privilege. Please retire
Lizzy, you lost me completely when you refused to endorse Bernie and later endorsed Hillary, I will never forgive or forget
and that is how we have trump nation
No we don't.  Didn't need it for 225 years. The people are smart enough to decide for themselves.  You just want bigger government
So @SenWarren, what are we to make of your endorsing & campaigning for his opponent last year? Was health care not a right then?
That's true, and another thing is that any of Trump's agendas are going to get through Congress.
We all agree emergency health care is a right. Y r we fighting over crisis aversion in the form of giving access all the time? it's cheaper!
Obama care doesn't make it more accessible but even more costly.
Yes
Ok..so you pay for it. Why should I pay more for my healthcare so that people that don't work or contribute get healthcare at my expense??
Thank You Senators Warren & Sanders for standing up for all Americans!
The GOP seems to think they have an immoral right to take away access. Something got lost in their translation.
@SenKamalaHarris Can the people of Ohio recall @robportman with enough support? If he votes for repeal, he is not for the people of Ohio.
"Access" is a republican talking point. Every American should be covered, period.
And who pays for this?
