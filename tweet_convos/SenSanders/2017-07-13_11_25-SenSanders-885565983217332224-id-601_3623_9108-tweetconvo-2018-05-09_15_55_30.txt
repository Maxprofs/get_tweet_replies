My Democrat colleagues just love to talk about helping the marginalized, but somehow they want to tell every unborn baby to not live.
"Every"?
Sorry. *babies that are deemed lesser than the mother's convenience
What if the woman is pregnant as a result of rape or incest and is 15? Are you a hardliner on the subject?
Using the outlier to justify the standard. Nice
I just want to know how you feel about that outlier. That's all. ?
If it's a result of rape or incest I completely understand an abortion. But that accounts for less than 1% of all abortions
Okay! So that's progress.. you are in favour abortion then. With very strict regulations..
when they are pregnant it is not just their bodies anymore...
It's not your body either. We cannot force our religious beliefs on others.
I guess we or you cannot judge someone's religion if you seen someone raping or beating child then ey?
Would you accept being under Sharia Law?
haha never gonna happen here. but I see you liberal young snow flake probably cali so im sure you do
Then why do you think others should follow your faith?
Democrats love to talk about choice, but somehow want to tell everyone what to do with their bodies. #EndTheDrugWar
Jeff Sessions is the one pushing the drug war, and last time I checked, he's a Republican. Seems to me the majority of Dems want legalize
On top of that, Obama could have rescheduled Marijuana at any point during his 8 years, but never did.
You should know by now that any president's word is not be-all end-all. It's basically Congress who controls the country.
The president has wide latitude to run the executive branch. Anything congress has delegated to an executive agency is under the President.
But anything the president wants passed has to be approved by Congress. It runs both ways. That's why ppl say Obama was awful.
If the president wants law changed, yeah. But if he wants to tell the FDA to do something they can do, he has the power.
will your plan cover orthodontist or optometrist? No. Will hundreds of thousands ever pay a cent for medical? No. Exchanges fail
No, dental and vision aren't covered by medical plans. They've always had to be purchased separately.
2me its 1 of the main reasons its missing the mark for hard working higher functioning healthy people.End Mandates
Honestly, I pay less than $12 a pay period on dental and vision w/my employer funded plan. Compared to the nearly $120 for medical.
seems expensive, check if you've have ortho coverage in ER event. How about that deductible b4 service?
For medical? Yes, it is expensive, but I work for a small company with >75 employees. Rates also rose this year due to large claims lst yr
For dental & vision? It's the same as I was paying when I worked for a company with 6k+ employees. I'm assuming that's a fairly avg cost.
Current dental covers 50% for ortho with $50 deductible
They need to look up the word "liberty"
WHY DIDNT WE ELECT HIM? BECAUSE WE DONT DESERVE HIM!

Life begins at conception. Abortion is murder. To deny either is to deny science. Progressive? I think not.

You tell em girl
Bernie not funding Planned Parenthood is not removing a woman's choice, if they want to terminate baby they can, we just don't need to pay.
What about the other body inside? What choice does she or he have?
That body relies on the mother and doesn't have constant brain activity until around 25 weeks after conception.
I meant the body relies on the mother throughout pregancy. Just clarifying.
So, it is not another life? When does it begin?
I would say it begins at around 25 weeks.
Have you ever seen an 12 weeks ultrasound?
NO! WE JUST DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT, NOR DO WE WANT TO PAY FOR GENDER REASSIGNMENT
Vincent and Andrew And MikePo Agree with Bernie Sanders
I don't care what they do with their body. I do care what they do with an unborn baby's body though.

Are you aware of this study? If ending abortion is your goal, then you should be supporting planned parenthood.
Wanna fill us in on the investigation Burn?
Came from a republican lawyer with no backing. They said he used his power as a senator to get a bank loan. That's completely unlike him.
PP does not provide such programs, we all know this. It should not be funded by tax payers money
Yes this is what planned parenthood is about in my city in the 70 it was the only clinic i could go to and afford i was 18 no insurance
We need to take back the language. We are all #ProLife but we r not all #ForcedBirthingDemanders normalizing the rape & enslavement of women
Thank God for planned parenthood. Every teen needs reproductive education and help when they need It! School  Nurses know this need well!
Lying again, supporting things like racist planned parenthood,aimed at reducing minority populations, shut up and retire #SellOutSanders
By "their body's" do you mean the baby's or the mother's?
Great story. Maybe Planned Parenthood should get out of the abortion business and help more babies.
Men don't get say-so on abortion or anything else having to do with women's bodies. Stick to what ails your penis.
About half the babies killed are male, but I care about female babies killed too. I have just as much a right to speak up as anyone.
It's not about the woman's body Bernie, it's about the babies body that its growing inside, because of a CHOICE SHE MADE to have sex. Geez
Blame the woman? You're joking right? Men are walking penises looking for an orifice from the first time they masturbate.
Then how come the man can't choose to kill their kid?
Bernie Sanders seems to have some pretty interesting notions about women and their bodies.
First off, it's from 1973, and second off, what's wrong with writing that?

That doesn't answer my question
Get help.
60% of women have rape fantasies. Talking about that + BDSM isn't a crime
You mean like Obamacare and your single payer dream wants to tell everyone what they can/can't do with their body too?
Actually you only have 2 choices on what to do w/ your body under #SinglePayer. Go to a doctor or don't.
and then the Government gets to tell us what we can and can't do once we get there!
Nope, that's between you and your doctor. Gov't just pays the bills, thus #SINGLEpayer
Really, so the Gov. has NO SAY? Bullshit! VA is single payer and the government has EVERY SAY in my hubby's care!
Well my father in law goes to VA and seems to be cared for just fine. Maybe your state restricts access.
I guess all those stories of people dying waiting to get seen are lies.  Because your FIL is getting taken care of that means is just fine
You're just as autocratic; you tell ppl not to indulge in identity politics. As though that - right there - isn't identity politics.
You said Planned Parenthood was The Establishment, remember? If not, I wrote about it last year.
Bernie is as lunatic as Trump both sides got duped
They can do what they want with their bodies but it's not just their bodies, there's a human child they're murdering. #AbortionIsMurder
@PPact wish the repubs could more like you -ya slime ball
I couldn't give a shit less about the woman that wants 2 kill a baby. The baby is the important issue. Animals kill their young.
Never hear about that though on a crazy white Wings site that's always talks crap about Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood= woman health
Democrats love to call themselves pro choice. So why are they against school choice? Let parents decide Bernie.
"Leave my body alone.... you will pay for my birth control AND for the abortionist to go into my uterus and kill my baby"
Planned Parenthood should never receive another dollar to watch the oversight of a merger a babies all over the pictures tell the story
What I say to women remember that he's a baby inside of you not just a fetus and the choice is to keep it not destroy it not murder it

Everyone should have free healthcare and equality, except unborn children! - Crazy uncle Bernie
Kinda how Democrats LOVE to say they're against homophobia, misogyny & bigotry but excuse all of this in Islam

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6OZVPIQkQU … … …
Ladies please make your choices BEFORE conception
I don't care what they do with their bodies. It's the baby's body I'm concerned with. Of course most Socialists don't value human life.
That is what ur asking 4. look at baby Charlie situation  (singlepayer state control healthcare). No thank u. Gov shouldn't b in healthcare
They have a choice Bernie, we just don't want the government to pay for it. Our choice
I love this girls story. Probably lots of us out there who could clarify what it means to get care from #PlannedParenthood.
While pregnancy is politicized, no woman will receive proper care. Period. #TonyaReaves
The U.N. and the Geneva courts must be on the right side of convicting the entire GOP for engaging in crimes against humanity.
Unfollowed. Not for the sentiment, but for the reality women still have to face.
Planned Parenthood is part of human rights and the Republicans chose to abuse and violate the rights of both women and human rights.
You are absolutely right, sir. The Republicans & The alt right are absolutely afraid of empowered women. It is a control issue.
Thank you so much for pointing out a hypocrisy that never seems to end.
And YOU love to endorse anti choice candidates! Don't try to pretend to care
I cannot IMAGINE kicking my child out for being pregnant & leaving her to fend for herself. #smdh
We're not telling them what to do with their bodies God is read the Bible Bernie the only true book in the world
We don't need Planned Parenthood. There are MANY MANY other womens' healthcare clinics... that actually do all of the exams that PP doesn't.
Abortion is not woman's healthcare. Abortion is killing an unborn child.
I think its location, and tax $'s
Own sex life n we have no problem
I would think that women should worry about their own bodies.Not my business until they expect me to pay for their mistakes. Pay for your
Factually speaking..no. They only want to excluding funding for killing babies
My democrat colleagues just love to talk about choice, but somehow they want to tell everyone what firearms they can't own.
How bout what a woman can and cannot do with her own money?
Because maybe they value life rather than listening to a grandstander with no moral soul committed to abortion
You want to tell us what to do with our earnings, firearms, education, Insurance, medicine, retirement, businesses...
if it was their body they would be dying.
Planned Parenthood is GOOD for women.
The republican way is authoritarian Republicans take away freedom take away choice Republicans are trying to kill people off
Now, Bern, you know that Republicans know whats best for everyone!
PP gave me a car seat 4 sitting in a parenting class. Now she's is old enough 2 learning how 2 drive. @PPact TY
Fight on

I'd rather a once pregnant 15yr old tell other 15 yr olds to not have sex or have 'safe' sex. Rather than fight for Planned Parenthood
At some point during pregnancy it's no longer just her body though. There IS another life to consider.
We Rs don't give a crap what Libs do with their bodies. We do however, care about them murdering babies.

Correct, it's not an excuse to  an innocent person. So don't use my tax #SENATORFAIL
I can relate. As a women I feel I should be able to make my own choice. Or my family.
Last time I checked, having a child was a consequence of a choice made approximately 9 months before.
Not always
That's correct. Not always, and in those instances I fully support the right to a choice. However in 99% of the cases it's not.
It also depends on what you determine to be a choice. If you have safe sex and still get pregnant then what?
I would say the majority of people know there is a risk of pregnancy even when having safe sex. I would still say you take on that risk.
Yeah I'm just saying the decision to have sex isn't the same as the decision to give birth to a child.
Personally, I don't see them as mutually independent events. That's where I take issue with it.
I guess we disagree on that. I'm definitely not someone who encourages abortion but every situation is different. I see both sides.
Publicly admit and deal with Planned Parenthood inducing 300,000 abortions ... out of total 900,000 in U.S. EVERY YEAR.  Genocide.
What about the babies body?? Or is that just for sale?
I think getting abortions because u aren't responsible for your actions is very wrong. Get a tattoo to show u control over your own body
Oh Bernie, you're such a fraud. And such a liar.
Choice is great 4 people with higher socioeconomic status (SES) but no relevance 4 folks who cannot participate in the market...
Republicans love to limit our choices to false choices of THEIR choosing
Expecting you 2 B responsible for your own birth control & not murder babies is NOT "telling you what to do with your body"
Incredibly Lame.
You just want to keep killing babies under lies of choice.  You also want to destroy America set up under UN dictatorship. Treason globalist
Wow, cool story bro. #FakeNews. So 1 out of thousands, PP help adopt rather than abort. #BankFraudBernie
Republicans aren't pro-life they're pro-birth. Once it born it don't matter to them anymore. All this is about is to control women's bodies.
There is NO constitutional right to choose to kill an unborn baby!!!
What? They didn't want U 2 abort the child? I went there, was told this isn't a women's health care center. Post menopausal women don't go
I also don't have a choice about having to. It health insurance because of democrats. Thanks a lot
I believe in a woman's right to choose, I just don't want to pay for it. Make her boyfriend/partner husband/her pay for her shit
No they just don't want to pay for abortion with their constituents money. It's that simple.
They also don't want to pay for prenatal care, food stamps, health care, education or anything else a child born into poverty needs.
LET EM TELL ME. LET EM TELL ME.....oops, maybe I need a tranquilizer, OR MAYBE I'M A LOT LIKE AN AMERICAN WOMAN EH? YEAH..breathing innnn
Women have the right to choose btwn murder n life. Don't want my taxes going towards abortion.
Planned Parenthood saved my life when I had a tubal pregnancy.  Without them I would have died and my 3 boys wouldn't be alive today.
That's Real Talk
Unborn children are not their bodies. They are independent souls, and to kill them and sell their body parts should be unacceptable.
They can do whatever they want with their bodies. I just don't want to pay for their stupid choices!
Don't need PPH with Obamacare. Talk about wealth redistribution take taxpayer money and cycle back to DNC.Stop PPH making campaign donations
Their body their choice their RESPONSIBILITY Bernie
#DefundPP
Planned Parenthood opposes single payer. Pick your allies carefully. Their goals are not yours.
So PP helped her NOT hv an abortion & then helped her NOT hv an unplanned pregnancy? & did so @ medical professionals NOT morality cops? WOW
What about the sovereign body inside?  Who protects them.
There are other options to Planned Parenthood that don't major in abortions.
Yet NONE of you will DO YOUR JOB and sit down and fix this mess.  Bernie has whined for decades to fill his wallet but never produced
and sleaves
It is my choice not to pay for your abortion. 

You want an abortion, you can pay for it yourself.
Nope we don't care. We just don't wanna pay for it
No, republican likes women to do whatever with their bodies at their own expenses.
Nobody should have the right to kill another Human !  Planned Parenthood does though, with Dems backing and taxpayer $ !
With her body. Not with their bodies. I wish our legislators were literate.
No they are just NOT for murder
Abortion is MURDER
I don't want other people telling me they need my money for their reproductive rights!
PP will go down in the books for the most corrupt/unethical businesses ever. They do give women a choice but dont pretend the provide care.
The government tells us many things we can and can't do with our bodies. Dumb argument.
They choose to appease their supporters. Damn the torpedo's full steam ahead.
If it Gov funded it our tax money and YES we the ppl have a say.
It's all about the freedom to chose what the Republicans tell them to do. Otherwise, they get branded as floozies and derided.
WRONG! We don't like being told that we have to foot the bill. I could care less if a woman wants an abortion. #govtarenotparents.

the fetus reties on the mother throughout pregnancy and does not have constant brain activity until around 25 weeks after conception.
(2) for a child he didn't want..because the mother of the child wants to keep it...( re: unmarried parents) double standard...equal rights?
Why is it that the man who fathered the child has no say in the matter..re: aborting his child..yet..he is held responsible 4 child support.
Thank you @SenSanders that is a fantastic story! One of many I am sure. People need to stop talking and listen once in a while!
we have a right to our bodies except you draw the line about choice in insuring our bodies; then you want to own us.
Yes because your women are sluts and slept around then they get pregnant and want to aboard, the fetus can't defend themselves. So wrong.
You and your wife had a choice to not defraud people. Your supporters choose to be violent. Choices are very one sided w/ the Bernster
Your "rights" are that the government doesn't intrude in your life NOT to give you free stuff.
Republicans love choice schools, choice of healthcare , choice of individuals being responsible to gov control. Fraud old man
Go read a biology textbook. The placenta isn't even the woman's body never mind the baby she is carrying.
How about -do whatever you want and you pay for it.
Make whatever choice you want.  Just don't ask everyone else to pay for it.
Or you can respect that some people are Pro Life.
Well said. Wish all could hear this young lady tell her story of the importance of Planned Parenthood & Medicaid.
Read the new health plan with your grandmother, sister,  wife, daughter, & a female friend or two and listen. Then you'll have your answer.
My summary of this classic argument:
You: "Bodily autonomy for women."
Them: "Yes, and also for unborn children."
You: "No, fascists!"
Bernie 
If a women is pregnant and her child has a penis, does she now have a penis?
I don't give a crap about what u do with ur body.  It's the babies body I'm  concerned about.
Why do u want to force my body to take vaccinations, Bernie?
If I told YOUR supporters not 2murder ppl on baseball fields, would I B telling them what to do w/ their bodies? Taking away their "choice?"

Great video by @Cernovich highlighting the side of Malcolm X that the Left always chooses to ignore. 
NO JUST IRRESPONSIBLE WOMEN WHO MAKE THROW A WAY BABIES TOO MANY CONTRACEPTIVES OUT HERE TO MAKE UNWANTED BABIES PERIOD
Pro choice means it is not prodictatorship!
Hey Bank Fraud Bernie, so your choice was to NOT PAY back your $10 million dollar loan BANK LOAN!! That's Fraud Bernie!!! You belong in jail
Unborn children are not mom's bodies, but independent ppl. That's science. To kill them and sell their body parts is unacceptable.
What about the lives of the unborn, what choice do you give then?
Considering fetal tissue does not have the neurological structures required for decision-making, it's kind of moot.
Do you make decisions in your sleep? Well maybe you should think about that next time you are sleeping. #Babieslivesmatter
keep up the great work @SenSanders you are a great politician who actually fights for human rights!
Sum up this vid quick "I made shitty choices as a teen and other people should pay for them"
No they don't want to tell any woman what to do with their bodies, that was Bill Clinton.
Here we can see the original Democrats and Socialists making their offerings to Moloch.
Rep's aren't telling women what to do, but to consider giving the unborn a chance to life before committing murder & inevitable consequences
Planned parenthood also profits from the sale of fetus parts.  That's sick and your sick
If they don't want ppl to tell them what to do w "their" bodies, they shouldn't be allowed to kill someone else's body. #NoAbortion
1 Kings 3:26 .... which half? ?
You mean to not kill their unborn babies?
They can do what they want with the bodies; the issue is I and others don't want to pay for it.
For the 1000th time, Senator Dipshit: I don't give a damn what women do w their bodies. Don't make a baby & then murder it.
And Marxists like you want to deny us health care choice, education choice, retirement choice...You want us all in government programs.
It is anti-science to say a fetus is not separate and alive.
You have to have your baby but they can't live in my neighborhood
Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 says unborn child IS a viable human & killing=MURDER. So what's the difference w/Abortion Bernie?
Women can do what they please with their bodies. The taxpayers don't have to pay for it

Wow Bernie, separate brain, heart and heartbeat, unique DNA... tell me how this is the "woman's body" again. What a load of crap Mr Sanders!
What a load of crap Robert. You don't get say-so in whatever a woman does with her body, especially abortion.
.@SenSanders let's finish the phrase #Bernie...right to choose...TO KILL MY BABY! What about right to Life,Liberty,pursuit of Happiness?
I have been so impressed by the compassionate Christian, conservative kindness that has been shown in response to your tweet.
Wait. Medicaid pays for abortions?  Thought that was illegal?
You make killing the innocent cool, Bernie!!!  
Kind sir, can you define choice for me?! Can I have a Chezburger daily or forbidden!!?
Not their body- just the little human inside their body.  You know the one who can't speak up for himself?
If you don't want abortion..then don't have one!
Isn't that the truth!?!
