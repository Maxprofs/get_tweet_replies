Funny you helped Trump by using Russian propaganda against HILLARY and I watched you last night admitting it I'm a life long FDR. dem &will
Hillary dug her own grave. She really is a republican. She should have run on their party. I am so happy she lost. Every day, I am joyeous!
Good for you enjoy trump.
Hahaha is this a joke? What does socialism pay to the lowly worker, $5 and a cheese sandwich? 
The only word missing from this is "truthful". I'm sure it was just due to poor proof-reading. Might want to advertise for one those too.
"Must under stand the US Criminal Fraud Codes and all banking laws."  #LOL
Sorry. I have to organise railway-workers in Holland

Please decide to run , please  for the country for the people!!!!
Where do I sign up. I can spew nonsense for the right price.
Sanders needs someone to wipe the drool from his chin while he mumbles to them what to tweet. #Arthritis #Demented
trump,family & cronies not only met with pukin,Russia also, Fake news, money laundering lies,not really President & he knows it# Y HE DENIES
I'm young enough (only 75) and I was interested until I hit some of the Experience Requirements. Oops. Oh well, maybe next time. God bless.
You're gonna need to brush up on bank fraud, influence of office and spousal privilege laws. Otherwise, should be fun.
Gladly! I need $15/hr wage because you say that's what a livable wage is

Seriously?
Apply to be one of sanders liars.
R U Serious?  Who could take the heat?
Members of the communist party get preferential treatment.
Nope. #dirtygrandpa
a great way to get people to follow one person then just allow all those votes to be scuttled and you back the HORRID CLINTON

If you are a woman you will get paid .50 on the dollar but don't worry he's all about woman's equality
@_autumnx3 go work for Bernie! I'll come visit

As a fellow Sanders I would love too but I'm not in America
I wish I knew how to video edit... and was older than 15
You should mention you take half of her/his paychec - because you're a pinko lover.

Bet he won't pay them minimum wage!
Future socialist wanted LOL
And earn less than $15/hour. #BernieIsAFraud
All you criminals want to do is give away the government's money to break the country so that everybody will be put on welfare
If we could stop you criminals from squandering all the government's money I believe our country could have free medical for everyone
Democrats must concentrate on winning next election and not waste too much time on Russia & other distractions
Heads up: He does NOT pay interns $15.00; no matter how much he tells you that should be the minimum wage.
Seeking Stalinist and socialist schmuch to advance my eutopian beliefs. Please do not have an open mind. Thanks BS

@HuffPost @politico Must be adept at handling charges of bank fraud.
lunatic
Paid interns?  This guy is clearly not a Democrat
As a 65-year old with a broad resume who just had a position "terminated" b/c it was too expensive, I envy the young person who lands /1
So they can be paid less than the $15 per hour you are fighting for? #hypocrite oh wait, interns don't get paid.
Creating another batch of reporters for the dnc media corporations. Propaganda 101
Bernie look for some young minds to corrupt and some nice ass, oh yes you must put out, be very pliable
Took screen shot of this tweet to post on #Facebook, it won't allow me to post. #Censorship #FCC #AjitPai #NetNeutrality #FreeSpeech??
