I can hardly wait for the opponents to start pointing out the job losses for thousands of insurance middlemen.

#pathetic
How do people not see the Bernie Trump parallel?? The Bernie Sanders Show? The egos are real.
The biggest ego imaginable is out on circuit pushing the obituary she wrote for the (D) party.
Yeah. Thank god Bernie didn't do a book tour.

Wait.
Bernie's book subject: pulling people into the political process as a catalyst for change. HRC's book subject: It's your fault I lost.
Bernie's Book Con't: As long as you agree with every single one of my policies. If not, you're the enemy. #puritytests
Supporting policies that voters back is now some kind of evil #PurityTest the average (D) can't handle?
No, but the average voter also doesn't know the details of the bill, and in its current form it's extremely flawed.
What's flawed is the attitude about it. Compare original ACA bill to it's finalized form.
WE will NEVER in your lifetime (what's left of it) DO SINGLE PAYER!!!!!

NEVER!

NEVER!

NEVER!

NEVER!

NEVER!
Like at the VA?
I AGREE YES MEDICARE ALL BUT DONT MAKE DEMOCRATS LOOK BAD YOU USED US. AT YOU CAN RETURN THE FAVOR.  I FEEL USED. YOU ARE A FRAUD.
How ya gonna pay for it?
Been covered like a million times & really isn't complicated. Try google & filter out all the moron GOP & Establishment-Dem comments.
I was a professional journalist for 25 years. Nowhere have I seen anything that explains exactly how the plan will be paid for.

Me. That was 45 years ago, and I'm sure he regrets saying it. Whereas our current president got elected after bragging about forcing himself
on women just a few years ago, and never showed the slightest bit of remorse. There's a reason the right got the "deplorable" title.
Nothing but the truth
My favorite part of this interview was when she admits you could wait several months to a year for care.

Bernie we already do.
I hope it does pass. But I'm not holding my breath. All Dems should be on board not only a few.
True, but they've clearly gotten out of touch. I expect we'll need to elect better Democrats for this to pass.
Only an idiot believes the government can give you free stuff . They have to confiscate $ from those of us with JOBS!
I don't kno this US plan, but kno Canada's: It's not perfect, but good. I think to improve, there should be a small fee associated per visit
the healthcare system with an extra money and more fairness. It also helps to scare some people that go to the hospital for no good reasons.
exactly
Maybe you should move to Canada @SenSanders and see if it really fits your description. I wonder if Bernie realizes that Canada utilizes....
......the difference in execution over abortion?
Bernie sucks he help to elect Traitor Trump . Bernie never. Democratic Traitor.
Wait, what?
https://youtu.be/NyIWpYDP-PQ  "would bankrupt the nation..." ~ You
Don't forget to include the rest of the quote:  "unless we change the funding system"  #ContextMatters
That's a side point. Media and alt-media has a tendency to do this. I think we all would benefit with looking at the larger picture.

Bernie is furious we found this video! “If we expanded Medicaid to everybody...we would bankrupt the nation.” ,1987 

Lets not fool folks - this is the only thing you got positive Strong acceptance over

Remember back when?
wont happen, greedy capitalists control everything and will refuse to lose money.
Americans already fell for "like your Dr. Keep your Dr."  B.S lies.  We know  this would bankrupt this country


But in 1987 this would have bankrupted America....your words Bernie.
ffs Quote the entire sentence "unless you change the funding system".
MID-TERMS COMING UP BETTER OFFER MORE FREE STUFF YOU KNOW WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO GET A BUNCH OF YOUNG IDIOTS EXCITED!
LIAR LIAR!!! WHY DO CANADIANS COME TO USA FOR HEALTH SERVICES, MRI's ETC.???  WHY BERNIE?? You are a liar!!!!!!!
#S1804 #BernieCare #SinglePayerNow
if...
None of that is true. Government shouldn't decide what treatments patients get.
Better tell us all where the people in the Insurance Business you say you'll get rid of will be sent to work? Obama made sure of their jobs.
Sanders has 2 tell the people whose livelihoods depend on their jobs denying claims or what all they do shuffling paper where they will work
Bernie's single payer prgm would include all illegals too. Would you like paying more for illegals? Not me! H/C is not a right but a privil.
It is only for legal citizens you know. They need to show proof that they are American. Do you know nothing about the bill?
When I read about #MedicareForAll, I thought NOW I'll go to the States for health care.
That must why the waiting lines are so long for Procedures but they get right in here.
How will this be funded
@HuffPost @politico will you, and the rest of Congress accept it as your halth insurance?
Gov run healthcare? Lmfao. You people can't find your asses with both hands. Who in their right mind would trust you with this?
Will the government be part of the plan, you know congress and government employees?
better than me? My health care is great!
So this really should be a no-brainer!
Perfect for the USA lol
That's not saying much.
Canadian system does not incl dental as I believe your system would. Do however have coverage thru employer ins. Same with drugs. It works
say whaaaaaat? (Canadian I AM)
Don't say that 
Trump may put a wall between Canada and the USA
"free" expensive shitty healthcare for everyone!!!!!!!!  is ur wife in jail yet?
Socialism in action
Can rabbit meat save Venezuela from going hungry? http://cnn.it/2xn4rxk  

#MedicareForAll can't work because we spend a lot on military, foreign aide, etc. The US can't fund something like Britain's NHS because...
...we won't have the money to do so.
That's a low bar. We already have a much better system, Bernie.
Bernie 2020, you're my boy Bernie!
Congress already spends 1 Trillion dollars more than the government takes in, we cannot afford this at this time.  Clean up first.
Senator, this is completely misleading. Not sure what decade you live in but few employers pay for family plans; only cover % for employee.
$$$$$$$$$$$$ ?
You can be sure Sanders doesn't have Medicare. You have to buy 2-3 add'l plans plus high deductible..to afford Medicare.Source: My life
Will it really only be a 2.2% income tax to fund this? That is much much cheaper than health care now!
And does Canada have a $34T price tag? We're already 20T in debt. Tell us how this is to be paid. Give us ur plan. Spell it out.
Setting the bar low.
Let me also add that those talking about how great our system is probably have employer paid extended health. Totally differerent.
Where's the plan? Can we read it?
Bernie, let's pray that the bill passes through Congress.
Good luck it's going to be a battle.
Sure !!! The poor will get great free stuff and the middle class will pay for it
RIGHT NOW HEALTHCARE COST 10000 per person IF WITH YOUR PROPOSAL WE CAN REDUCE THIS COST EVEN by 30 %TO40% !THEN OUR ECONOMY WILL  PROSPER!
BLAH BLAH BLAH WE DONT NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU
Wrong, the country will be completely bankrupt. Bernie Medi for all plan is a crackpot. Will never happen. I'll make sure of it.
Who the hell cares what Canada has this is America, freedom of choice not government choice , we don't need the govt. to care for us DTS n U
Bullshit. We will have a plan that is not a plan. It becomes the only option, controlled by governement. Not by me-by government
SENATOR YOUR PROPOSAL IS GREAT I KNOW GOD WILL BLESS US FOR YOUR VISION AND EFFORTS!
REMEMBER WITH MONEY COMING IN! THE CORPORATIONS LIFELINE OF GOVERNMENT !A 50% ,DECREASE THEN WE MUST ADD TO DEFICIT TO BALANCE BOOKS+++
Won't work here,,everybody too fat
Um. Billy Tauzin, III and Cokie Roberts and Patten & Boggs are on the .  DC beltway 3  circus!
Would be a diff story today with this bill as a shoe-in if we voted with brains in November. This would all be a reality. It was so easy.
WITH THIS AND NOW! THE TREATH OF MARKET COLLAPSE IS DETERMINED BY WHAT POLICIES YOU MAKE WITH TAX REFORM !REMEMBER WITH MONEY IN REVENUE++
The existing FOR PROFIT Healthcare System we have is so Top heavy in Paperwork. Paperwork that DENIES your CLAIM 1st. CEO's Bank Huge Bonus!
Healthcare & L CORP. CEO's awarded Huge BONUSES by Board of Dirs. BOD are Rewarded by CEO's with increased Salaries for their 4 Days YR work
No money left over for any IMPROVEMENTS within the SYSTEM. Perfect, because tge PURPOSE of tge SYSTEM is for the Profit to BENEFIT TOP 1%!
You are unhinged
Medicare liberals rant about single payer... as long as it is the govt paying. @TheDemocrats only understand socialism, not free market
With Gov control of HC & ripping the $$$ directly from wage earners via payroll deduction whats your cut #BankFraudBernie
@TheDemocrats - that's all they know, socialism. If the govt doesn't pay for medical insurance, they no comprende.
Bad idea, puts your healthcare in hands of gov't !
No, healthcare still in hands of h/c providers. Govt becomes chief negotiator to do things like bring price of drugs down.
no, no you wont. you seem to mis-understand the cost issues in the US
SENATOR THIS IS A SURE WAY TO COMPLETELY PROTECT ALL AND STABALIZE OUR ECONOMY !HEALTHCARE IS ONE FIFTH OF US ECONOMY!
"And you Get To Keep Your Doctor"  
You'll never see a doctor.  Maybe an occasional nurse
Dems should have done this when they were a majority. But instead they sold out to Wall St and gave us Obamacare slavery.
Your buddy Cain said , I have the best health care and so do you .  Thanks tax payers how you and your wife doing on that colleges deal
Medicare for all would most definitely Morph into MEDICAID for all.
WE NEED SOM PRACTICAL AND AFFORD THAT WILL NOT DECAY FOR DECADES TO COME   IN THE LIKES OF SOCIAL SECURITY IN THIS WE ARE CREATING A FUTURE!
 Well, it's still good a good system. The Gov't can't give everyone everything. That's called "Socialism"
Hope this isn't more of the Democrats election year promises that never happen
I'm sure they think they can finesse it like that. It's our job to make sure they can't.
Anything extreme is bad. Free healthcare means someone else pays. The rich control the govt so middle class Americans will now pay more.
Agree
But Bernie, I want fee housing, WiFi & all other universal amenities paid for...

I want to be a slave too - a government dependent sheep
Bernie - bank fraud - never worked in private sector he is a joke on all levels.
America has the ability to do every good thing better than any country
Keep on keeping on Bernie.  For the people.
Rabbit meat...."for the people"
Can rabbit meat save Venezuela from going hungry? http://cnn.it/2xn4rxk  
Yeah right. Have you seen our government work. Of course you have.
