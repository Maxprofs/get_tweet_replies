Crisis pregnancy centers dont get a dime of taxpayer funding. Yet they help thousands of pregnant women ea year. Called fundraising. Try it
“Help?!” Crisis pregnancy centers lie to desperate women & proselytize http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824%2812%2900415-5/abstract …
This org is Catholic like Bernie is. Democrat. Frauds. No practicing Catholic denies the obvious sin of killing innocent humans.
You really enjoy spreading disinformation. Bernie is not Catholic & even if he was there really are pro choice Catholics out there.
10% don't represent majority. I'm not Catholic but understand what they believe and why. Abortion is death, denying God and His Plan.
Pfft if you’re not Catholic you are not qualified to speak on their behalf
I can speak for 99% of practicing Catholics I know incl my Catholic grandma 12 kids, reason Im alive. Nice try tho. You wont silence me.
Part of the GOP genocide.
IF that happens, churches within communities will step up, as it used to be and should be!
Churches should start paying taxes.
If churches have to pay taxes, then all the communist orgs that Soros et.al set up have to pay taxes too.
Hard to classify that as equitable
We love your new campaign slogan Bernie:  Make America Venezuela Again
I see what u did there. Pick the worst country instead of focusing on the many other successful nations. That's weak.
Venezuela was the strongest economy in South America until the Communists destroyed it as they have destroyed all countries they have ruled.
Socialism isn't communism. Maybe learn your 'isms'. 

Venezuela collapsed due to low oil costs & no other exports. Get your facts straight.
You're perfect consumer of communist propaganda.
Your insults lack humour, show your lack of intelligence & rebuttal ability. Sad.
They are not insults. They are constructive criticisms and statements of fact.

People frequently desire socialism when polled, and they try to vote for it but get misdirected in all sorts of ways
People also desire bigger homes, a new car, travel and financial freedom,  non possible with Socialism.
Life is about making trade offs do you agree? Perhaps it is worth losing some luxuries if more people have needs met
Its only a trade off only if we both agree. Socialism is imposed and corrupt. It's never delivered equality except poverty for all.
Happy to provide meals on wheels, but attach it to SNAP. Reduce food stamps by the cost of meals/service. Problem solved
The @GOP is trying to snuff out the weakest people in the states.
So tell me something. With all the disasters and trillions of $ in debt how does one pay 4everything? How does one blame Trump? Smh
Not one, millions know that Trump is guilty.
He's guilty of having a budget and our country being trillions$ in debt?He's guilty that everyday there's a disaster needing $we don't have?
Tell me how you urself pay for your neighbors needs when u are broke and in debt so far you'll nvr get out? Then maybe I'll listen to you
As with most civilized societies, we pay considerably higher taxes, for the best healthcare and education l. Everyone shoulders their share.
Ur not gettn it. They could tax everyone tomorrow 100% and we'd still be in debt. Tell me how if ur reality was this way ud b able 2fix it
So what is the best way we can counter the heartless GOP besides voting them out?
Raise awareness of what they do and hopefully convince people who do vote GOP not to
# PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR D.TRUMP WILL LEARN SOONER,THAT THEY HV VOTED TO THE WRONG GUY.GAVE FAKE HOPE TO THE NATION & TAKING EM MORE LOW.
They don't seem to be learning that unfortunately, they have a strong right wing media machine keeping them brainwashed
# ITS TRUE,THEY HV GOT MEDIA MACHINE TO BRAINWASH,BUT BELIEVE ME IT WILL NT WORK ANY MORE.TRUMP IS UNWANTED&HATE PREACHER PERSON IN POLITIC
I’m just aghast at this D.T’s actions. Who could do that? It breaks my heart #haveaheart
Lies
Worse: they don't help PR get drinking water. Many people will die trying to find something to drink. US citizens.

GOP = cruelty
With budget for war at 700bn/annum+black budget surely they could sort out actual problems of the US population
"Welfare to the lazy" says only a "moron" or Ayn Randian
Hmm I guess it's a good thing for YOU you're in that 1%! 
Stupid comment
End this rediculus reign and misuse of power... IMPEACH LIL-DONALD>>>https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/923037130292523008 …
I can t live on $7.25 an hour so I choose to bust my but and work incredibly hard to make more. I don’t sit back and take support.
Bernie Sanders is a putz. Instead of whining step up and negotiate

Inhumane isnt removing the gov from certain sectors. Inhumane is supporting abortion while being upset someone else isn't feeding people.
I stand with you, Bernie.  We can't let this happen!
So Senator Sanders, what are you going to do to stop it?
That is a downright atrocity!
So sad.  We need to take care of those who cared for us. What if Mulvaney had parent living alone, no@close family and unable to cook?
 priorities.
Of course, that's the reason, Senator. Odd how you know so much about what's in so many other peoples' heads w/r/t motive. Foolish statement
There goes my mom's only social time with her peers and healthy food.
Maybe you Bernie could fly some to her on one of your private jet trips.
Well thanks to all those who voted for Trump, now enjoy the great America he offered
The greed of this administration is deplorable and disgusting may they never get back in power and rot in hell so much for being christians
Can't wait till 1 of their #family #members may somehow ever #need #MealsonWheels. Bet it would b #back in a flash if they cut it's #budget!
Bernie you live on fear and lies, nice guy.
Meals on wheels was so bad my mother couldn't even eat it.
You see, in Bernie’s socialism, there would still be a 1%, the people at the very top. And the rest of the nation would be dirt poor.
Yes, it’s not like giving the rich tax cuts in America is going to give them incentives to keep their jobs in America, no no, not at all.
It's easy to fight for tax cuts that'll cut yourself out, when you don't really pay taxes and therefore don't really matter anyway.
It's amazing how many idiots on here that are fighting for tax cuts that they'll be cut out of smh kinda like voting for Trump!
Breaks my heart 
#dwdd
Meals on Wheels wordt afgebouwd. Dat beïnvloed 1000den mensen hoor. Komt door @GOP #Trump. Enige maaltijd voor oudjes. #dwdd USA sucks
Complains the man with 3 houses.
Federal funding for Meals on Wheels is less than 5% of their yearly budget. Most donations come from corporate and private donations. I think MOW will be OK!

CBO study shows that ‘the rich’ don’t just pay a ‘fair share’ of federal taxes, they pay almost everybody’s share 
This is where the rub is. Tax breaks don't mean that these things don't get funded. It just means that private funding takes over from gov.
TWO WORDS. NEGATIVE VIBES
@nytimes @CNNPolitics @MSNBC why does everyone say you're a socialist or communist and a liar is your wife in jail yet
Bernie, where do you get this stuff? Do you sit in your room, and make this stuff up?
Old Bernie just cant pass up an opportunity to attack Trump for ending waste and fraud, his lies will come back to bite him.
Don’t forget boys and girls. Democrats like kids fight with feelings. Republicans are always left to wear big boy pants
There are plenty of other programs that could be cut ,not kicking the elderly to the curb after yrs. of paying taxes ,many still paying
And you people would listen to a socialist like Bernie? Then you do need help.
Put this program on the free market, donors, volunteers, families friends...
Stop lying to America Bernie.
Present day Robin Hood, steal from the rich to give to the poor.  How about just cutting taxes and the incredible SPENDING OF THE US GOVT?
I got a great idea they're Burn let's cut nothing out of the budget... You can always go back to the Soviet Union or Russia
That is just outrageous!! Stop programs that don’t work, looks like it works to me!! #stopsuitsinpower #seinorsmatter
More class warfare from socialist Sanders. Doesn't work Bernie.
Maybe we should take care of our own business and families instead of wanting the gov to. Families used to be strong. We need that again.
Outrages but nothing can be done. There is no democracy
Our elderly made this country we should at least be able to feed and have healthcare for them. Everyone should be able to have healthcare.

Disgusting.. all because trump wants to build a wall,Im disgusted, i thought a president is suppose to care about the people in his country
I'am so disheartened and sickened , why are they really doing this ? Do they hate us seniors ? Do they hate the poor ? FUCK YEAH .
Fiscally stupid! The cost of a meal is about $8.00 ($3,000 per yr) compared to cost of $60,000 & more for public nursing home! Do the math!
You helped cause this mess... now you want to save us... in 2020?
Lie
Donors supply most of this
If guns don't kill people in the US, then starvation will. Awesome
Just cutting all the fat out Bernie. Closing all of the loopholes that illegals and opportunists use to abuse the system. It’s a good thing
Stop lying, Bernie.
No it wouldn’t
Trump has spent that much on golf already
Don’t forget about all the jet travel from this administration, they are all living the good li on the back of us Americans! F..king lowlife
Despicable.
How much of the private funding of Meals on Wheels is from the 5%? So you would tax for the last 25%... too? That's your idea of "fair?"
Nope. We need to stay on them though.
If you must, get it from the church, friends and family
Stop depending on other people to feed you
liar liar pants on fire.
Blah, blah, blah, blah. That’s all anyone hears when you talk
You should really stop making stuff up.
Meals on Wheels is not a federal program!
How about not killing the elderly or cripple?
You are a liar.
MOW is a state program Berrnie.  You are just a liar
GOP=Greed Over People
Republicans are evil yet they preach about God. They are the biggest hypocrites. Dems better gain lots of seats in the mid term election.
Where in the constitution does it say the feds will feed you?
I always hear you complaining about budget but I never see you drafting one
I guess if you are a socialist and think all this stuff grows on trees?  Socialism never worked.  Never will.  Get over it.
For one thing do you really believe this statement is accurate?  Come on.
WHY LIE? You think people are too stupid to check into this on their own? Even NPR disagrees with you.
LIE
So Bernie where is your budget I keep hearing you talking about spending I never hear you talk about actual budget
won't matter if your pack doesn't stop Top Dog's wrecking ball to democracy world peace environment women's rights 1st Amendment
I thought people paid for their meals! I didn’t know the government paid for the program
Beware, politicians often talk about cuts when they’re really just not increasing funds as planned but calling that a cut.
I'd rather have the option on who I give my money to, if I can afford to give at all.
Government has no authority to take from one and give to another.
We need it to help Puerto Rico you’re worried about!
This Same Woman will VOTE for Republican Congressional Members in 2018, if the GOP speaks of hurting Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims!!!!
American vote these type of people? Or I’m not in the planet  now?
If it weren’t for BS lies Bernie wouldn’t have anything to tweet about
BS
 (response to this proposal)
Fake news.
@POTUS supporters! Are you still happy with the @GOP ? It’s going to hit home - you’ll feel it!
It sucks getting old as it is!
Again why do we send foreign aid? It would help save many programs and P. R. They could get lot done with some of that money.
Corporations and the rich need the money so they can create minimum wage jobs for Trump's supporters, and sadly too many Americans.
Said one of the 1%
The 1% don't deserve more money why do they need it for? Being more rich or for just the satisfaction of screwing over some1 that needs it
Yes!  It is much more than just eating!  It is an in-person-safety-check, that makes their lives real!  Real People, Real Lives!
Wtf does this do for the american people that depend on this program and many other gvt programs that the 1% matter more to this admin #sad
I was always under the impression only a very small part of the meals on wheels budget was from govt funding. Mostly donations.
Trump must be so proud. Our country is showing how ignorant we are by allowing this moron to take all these actions. When will it stop?
Fuck me. Perhaps they understand apostrophes though.
The rich give to the GOP, GOP gives them tax breaks, Hence the taxpayers support the GOP. I resent that! GOP is a public moocher!
Why don’t you and the 1/10% hollyweed Mega wealthy democrats make up for that and pay more taxes yourselves and I’ll stick with what I have?

Horrendous! I have worked with seniors and know that for many this Is their only meal for the day.
76 mil. So take that from all perks and travel for the senate and you can still drive your A8 Bernie.
And this is exactly what  @POTUS  promised he would never do, but it's just typical of him to lie and break all of his promises.
Always take away from people who need it. Take away meals on wheels people will starve to death.  And the rich will get fatter.
Where is the humanity?!
This is absolutely disgusting!! Who are we becoming? Cash for a few, poverty for all??  Christian values include empathy!
We need #mealsonwheels
Only pre-birth life is worthwhile (used a weapon against women) the plutocracy needs a few servants & the rest of us to die away.
This is the worst administration we’ve ever seen and Republicans need held responsible for enabling him to meet their own agenda!
Why is the federal government giving money to meals on wheels?  Great program, for STATES to invest in.  10th Amendment does actually exist.
We're feeding big belly trump
OUTRAGED VOTER HERE!!! 
Meals on Wheels is such an important program 
I may need Meals on Wheels myself someday but I guess thoughts and prayers will suffice.
I may need lots of things later in life. That does not mean I want every possible thing federally funded, and controlled, and regulated.
This is disgusting. As long as there is enough money for the 1% at the top of the economic scale.
Shameful !
#DumpTrump Slogan should be "for the view 1% not the many"
They chose the weakest, poorest, and most vulnerable to extort taxpayer money from.  No conscience.  Taxpayer money for the rich tax cuts
Thank you Bernie—are you enjoying your “I told you so” moment? I am never supporting you again. You need to learn team play is what wins
A scandal in the so-called richest country in the world. Americans are stupid sheep! In Europe they would be in the streets by the millions
They could probably afford this program if administration officials flew commercial.

Welcome to the Banana Republic.
Ur a decent guy that used the system to profit. Impressive. Why do u want to hurt people with lies that are struggling? It's cruel.
It has been a long standing tactic. If the GOP says it the DNC says SS and MC or Meals on wheels is being cut. People are too stupid to read
Hey Beenie,  just because Govt doesnt steal my money to fund it, doesnt mean it will go away
If only we had the $150 billion given to Iran (part of it straight cash from the treasury flown over in secret) from that great Nuclear deal
The half truths and inflammatory statements you make are disgusting. Worthwhile programs will be supported rather than relying on tax theft.
False news.
Gov doesn’t need to fund that program, there r plenty of charities...lower taxes so I can donate more...again, ur complaints r ridiculous
That’s simply untrue, anyway. Charities do a better job than the government.
With so many charities I would assume no one is hungry in US. By the way, why do we have poverty in the richest country in the world? Ask the Clinton's, Obama and the leaches
more fear and bullshit from Bernie
AND IN THE MEANTIME, HES PASSING WHAT HE WANTS AND DOING AND SAYING WHATEVER, AND ALL YOUS DO AGAIN IS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT IM DONE
OVER AND OVER IVE ASKED ARE YOUS GOING TO AT LEAST TRY AND IMPEACH THIS CRAZY MAN?HE DOSE WHAT HE WANTS AND YOUS GO ON TWITTER AND COMPLAIN
So you don't think charitable organizations could not fill a 76m gap? Why is government the solution to every problem YOU see?
Which Republican created this plan? It’s time to recognize those in charge. Our leaders should be proud of their legislation.
Lies
need to bring trump and all those idiots that support him to go around visiting these people that they're cutting help from.
You lied
Ever notice the GOP / Trump pattern?  It's all about sticking it to people who were too lazy to inherit real estate.
You are unbelievable in your constant inaccurate statements. Fix the fraud & corruption in the programs there would be money available.
PLEASE STOP THIS MANIAC!
Just like the UK do they share their greed strategies?
Is it possible to charge someone with premedtated murder when people start dying for lack of food and health care after budget cuts?
Unfortunately no, that's probably too abstract and indirect to prove in court
So how does one make it less abstract? A person at a time? A county at a time? How many counts can one make stick?
Hey Bernie. Did Harvey donate to you ????  Should Cpme clean  your people Dems   Hollywood all the people whom support you time to speak
Well, we all know if your not a billionaire you just don’t matter thanks to hateful donald and the cowardly gop’
churches and communities will care for the elderly / not government / too much waste
the private sector will step in / gov cannot be trusted to spend our tax money wisely
I guess it's back to catfood...<not a joke> <not even slightly funny>
I loath the orange in office
Yet the money going into MOW is still go my up. That’s how baseline budgeting works.
But think of all the tax cuts we will enjoy.

Republicans in are just the Nottingham sheriff and Prince Jon from Robbin Hood. Everything for them and nothing for everyone else.
Yes but remember Robin Hood was still a thief and a tax dodge and a Lord that chose violence over diplomacy
No!!
This must be what is needed to offset loss in GMO sales and increased expenses in storing inventory. Terrible. THEY should not be allowed to offset their losses this way! It's in human.
Good job, Republicans....good job...it might be your mother or father that has their meals/wheels cut by this.
Well how lovely. Starve the homebound for the richest of the rich to get more tax breaks.
SO NOW THE REPL., ARE FOLLONG IN THEIR BOSSES FOOTSTEPS, TAKING FROM MEALS ON WHEELS.  DISPARRAGING THE ELDER. AGAIN!
@HuffPost @politico That, along with many other programs, should be funded by the States.
Where in the Constitution does it say we should fund Meals on Wheels?? I must have missed that section.
They are making a small government, cutting taxes, raising profits and making jobs.
That's their reasoning, I think.
Top 1% wants shut ins soup and sandwiches too! Bernie is a light of truth in this dark time.
All I see is a image (GIF) of a garage, three people & some empty bags. They've blocked the video. I don't know? It says image. Anyone help?
