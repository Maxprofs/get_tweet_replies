Thank you @SenSanders We are so grateful for you. God bless you.
He called it "tragic" -- an understatement
What about the humanitarian crisis in California and New York?? Just saying.
Hamas
No - to Money for the people in Gaza
Yes-To spending Money on Rockets and Terror tunnels to kill Jews /
@SenSanders explained that Israel “over reacted” to the #Gaza marches. What, exactly, would he view as  an appropriate “response” to unarmed civilians asserting their inalienable human rights? Should Israel have killed 3 or 5, instead of 17, or is it 30 protesters?
Syria 7 yrs DRCongo 30yrs. It will be ignored
Will the US bomb Tel Aviv and call the Israeli bandits "animals"?
We don't ignore it, we supoort and contribute to it.
These are the CANS, that keep getting kicked down for yet ANOTHER generation to handle ..BUT.. the Saudies have begged us NOT to do EVERYTHING we HAVE done, for good reason ! America has been Faustian ( including our allies) where the Middle East is concerned.
What an Idiot!  There is no peace without God and you Sir don't believe in him.
There are more homeless in USA than in Gaza.. and they have endless beaches in Gaza ( If they didn’t dump raw sewage on it)
True. We can’t continue to ignore aid being used to build terror tunnels instead of infrastructure.
Sure we can
Thank you Senator Sanders for being fair in speaking up about the crisis & suffering of the Palestinians.
SENATOR IF THEY.ARE PAID TO SHED THEIR BLOOD; LET THEM DO SO!
