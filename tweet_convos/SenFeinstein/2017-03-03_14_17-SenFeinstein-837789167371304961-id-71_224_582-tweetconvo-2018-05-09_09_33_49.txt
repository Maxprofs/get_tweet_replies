@DearAuntCrabby @JudiciaryDems grammar you stuttering old bag, Duane.
But if he wasn't fit to begin with, is perjury not reason enough to give him the boot? #gettoughdems #SessionsMustResign
@DearAuntCrabby @JudiciaryDems That's crap. They should be asking him to resign.
And should be asking every elected official the same questions.
he needs to resign!!!! Demand resignation now!!!
Watch @maddow show this evening. She has evid of Russ billionaire's planes showing up at same airport as trump's during elect
Thank you Senator Feinstein. Californians and the nation are counting on you to defend our country.
how many Dems met with Iranian officials? Aaahh. The desperate Left #MAGA
false equivalence- how many lied under oath, how many worked with foreign gvt to interfere in elects?
hypocrisy from the Dems is ALWAYS an equivalence- election interference in only 1 side unproven
Right, b/c trump will fairly investigate self. Unproven means need an indep. investigation.
fast and furious and Benghazi, Jarrett/ Clinton meet - pots and kettles baby
@GOPLeader admitted Benghazi was a political smear. Using fake scandal to equate real one.
lol kp telling urslf  that. and the  server bleaching? it goes on & on; addressing 1 is interesting; plse, continue
if ur so exercised about Clinton emails, why don't you care about Russian interference? Hypocrite.
better investigate Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton relationships with Russia-Uranium, speech fees, flexibility
Thank you.
Get him to resign, he was not qualified for the job of AG to begin with. Racist, white supremacists can't be AG
Also Jeff Sessions's memory is too feeble for the position. He can't recall various meetings.
In Writing? What is this BS? On camera under oath and in the seat for all of America to see!
That's what @TheDemocrats want; they are destablizing America's security with their hate! #StandWithSessions
I hope you won't let him change the lies on record without being ?'d in person! He can't be allowed to answer
@CHURCHLADY320 @JudiciaryDems Question him for 20 hrs without recess , They did it to a woman named HRC.
AG Sessions must resign. An investigation into Trump's Russian business interests must proceed. & tax returns!!
Did you ask HilLIARy about her ties with Russia or Saudi Arabia
Please stay strong on this. This is NOT an overreaction
Thank you for pursuing this!
questions about his lies from members on the committee  thru hand written responses!
thank you, Senator Feinstein! #mysenator
Thank you, Senator Feinstein!
didn't you confirm him?!?
@ChuckGrassley refuses to do so as he wants to protect the lying AG & complicit GOP. What action will be taken?
lock him up if you do then Democracy is still alive in the Us.
Your questionable Russian meetings and ties to Putin shouldn't be ignored. Time to #RESIGN
@MaggieJordanACN @JudiciaryDems you can pursue a deep prosecution for purjury or he can go away and resign .plee deal him out
Hello Senator Feinstein. Please help! We are all scared , frightened. We need All in hill to help !
A little heavy on the drama Binky! Relax and settle down, it will be all right...really.
@POTUS Far more compelling Congressional challenges than vindictive witch hunts. Do your job or resign. Dementia investigation
Fight for this Senator He perjured himself
Thank you for holding the AG accountable.
I urge the committee to call for his resignation but the complicit GOP is not even going to recall Sessions.
You're asking a proven liar to answer more questions? Seems pointless. Tell him to resign.
thank you, keep it up
Aw geez https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2017/03/03/heres-a-list-of-democrats-who-also-met-with-the-russian-ambassador-n2293775 â€¦
Do an investigation. He must resign.
The American people were asking these questions before and during Sessions appt in the cabinet. GOP rank &file
- if he can't recall mtgs & has memory issues then perhaps he shouldn't be AG. bc he has to remember the LAW.
@sarnold54 @JudiciaryDems Why is @SenStabenow now on that list once again? Sickening she won't stand for her people.
Any asked him if he passed any notes to the ambassador versus what he said? @maddow @timkaine
That's ANYONE ask if notes were passed. @alfranken
I saw a cute clip of u having lunch with the Russians..Hypocrite much Senator?
OMG, they dined together. Who paid? These politicians need 2 get off their high horses, get 2 work.
#IranianDeal was a benefit to #Russia
so who needs to account? No #falsestatement question related to #Fakenews
.@SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems #SessionsResign
perjury is NOT ok.  #SessionsMustResign
Perjury wasn't acceptable for Clinton. He was impeached for far far far so much less. Impeach DT
what about your false statements about #government #whistleblowers & #transparency #warcriminal #propaganda
we need special prosecutor to investigate this madness. We can't have an AG who lies under oath.
And you are expecting him to answer truthfully?  Silly legislators - he needs to go.
Thank you for demanding answers to AG #JeffSessions false statements & Russian contacts. #SessionsResignNOW
This needs to be done Sen Grassley. As an American I am a bit fed up with such dishonesty.
this liar needs to step down or be removed! It's not okay for the AG to lie under oath to Congress!
He gave his statement. We know he lied. #impeach.
This IS a Demand!! Something leads straight to the top!!!
You need to ask him to RESIGN ASAP!!! The people deserve better than this. Wake up!
Sessions must resign or be removed A liar cannot be USAG. O/w Zero confidence in Dept of Justice.
@jeffsessions NEEDS TO ACCOUNT to American people or #LOCKHIMUP  #ResignSessions
