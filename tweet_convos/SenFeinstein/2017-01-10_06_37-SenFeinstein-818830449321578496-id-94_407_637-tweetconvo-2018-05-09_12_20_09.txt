The left should follow these words also. Unfortunately you have utterly failed under Holder and Lynch.
The current AG has been far from FOR THE PEOPLE.NOT upholding WRITTEN LAW,like the AG has BEEN DOING,  is Criminal. Get Real!
@akeleven & not any kind of bigot!
Mr. Sessions is independent.  He does not ignore women who are victims of violence like you and your office.
@realDonaldTrump As a deplorable person I hope EVERY dem is voted out of power. They are just so past reality.
@SenFeinstein the last 8 years seem to differ with that statement.The DOJ has become a political attack dog for the President
I don't think he knows that......
#FeresDoc2ndRationale + #38USC511 crimes & #IGActDOJ cover ups = #DVAScandal and untimely deaths of US Vets.
@SenBlumenthal I wish.
@Melacook0515 then you don't want Sessions
Like Eric "My People" Holder? LOL
@realDonaldTrump Sessions has given his life devoted to this&nobody is more deserving Can't say same about Dems
You mean like Eric Holder was? Fast and Furious ring a bell? He should have been arrested.
@AnthonyLDolman WHY THE HELL DIDN'T OBAMA'S AG NOT STAND UP FOR US???????
@SenFeinstein lol yeah Holder and Lynch were examples of that lol NOT
.@JudiciaryDems how about some tough questions w/detailed follow up for Sessions? #StopSessions #votersuppression
@SenFeinstein You libs don't have the votes to block Mr Sessions. You can thank Harry Reid for that. LMAO!
you'll be laughing out of your ass soon oh sorry thats not your ass thats your mouth
.@JudiciaryDems Right...unlike #ericholder & @LorettaLynch who were both lackeys of @BarackObama or @billclinton before becoming #Obama AG!
@realDonaldTrump Trump has just started his protection of the law. STUPIDITY is so irresponsible & dangerous
@SenFeinstein like @LorettaLynch? You are laughable. NOW you're worried about telling POTUS no??
this useless fool hauled out like yesterday's garbage
Who lets these protesters into the hearing room?

Hey bruce you look exactly like your tweets DUH!
Then why didn't you say that to Lynch, Holder, and Obama? @CNN @foxnews
@SenFeinstein I could not agree more. @GOP agrees. Wonder why the opposite was true during @POTUS administration w/his AGs.
Trump is not setting up a regular administration.  Study history.  Too many parallels to Hitler.  Not a joke. #resist
@ourburninghouse Yeah good luck with that... those days r sadly over
I am not sure you know the meaning of honorable.
Too bad this wasn't your position about Fast & Furious. Or when Obama Admin weaponized the IRS. #Hypocrites
@realDonaldTrump What a spin lie this is. Senator Sessions has been life time doing this protection of law.
Obama AG was his right & left hand! Obama was NEVER told no! Obama trampled constitution & crickets! 
#Sessions
he's coming for us all. No to all nominees for being unqualified
only if you're a criminal.  But thanks for outing yourself.
@SenFeinstein you should have told Obama, Holder & Lynch this.  We have had 8 Years of biased disingenuous AG.  DISBAR ALL!
You stood silent as current AG used office to advance agenda of @POTUS. Your moral authority has no foundation
You never objected to Holder or Lynch violating rule of law consistently.  You are biased hypocrites all and unworthy
@SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein Hey Dianne, you gotta love karma!!!!!
so why has Obama had the two anti constituion AGs he has had?
where were you the last 8 years? Holder held in contempt of Congress.  Quit being phony you serve us as well
@SenFeinstein oh how the mighty have fallen...
Yet for some reason you didn't say ANYTHING when Holder and Lynch played defense for Obama. Hypocrite!
You do realize, that you just indicted Eric Holder! He did whatever Obama asked him to do!
How about trying to get our country back up & running instead fighting every thing! You work for us! remember?

It's awfully cute to hear Senate Dems now talk about the importance of the Attorney General in "enforcing the law."
#Lawless
@SenFeinstein no time in the last 8yrs has any person in congress the Whitehouse or the courts stood for the american people
NOW you want the AG to be independent? What about he past 8 years?
@SenFeinstein 
Tell that to the obamatollah?
@SenFeinstein Unlike Holder and Lynch! Both Obama lackeys!
PLEASE CLEAR SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS ASAP!! THANK YOU!!
@SenFeinstein where was your outrage with Holder? He was extension of the Prez office? Hypocrite
@SenFeinstein Also go after corrupt public officials, like former SOS Hillary! Too bad Obama's AG didn't go after her!
I feel safe knowing Sen Sessions will be my AG
@SenFeinstein Can you explain the context in which this quote was made by AG Edward Bates. What was the dispute with Lincoln?
@SenFeinstein please ask if he wouldn't meet with a former President if his wife was being investigated at an air port
you picked AG who were terrible did not enforce our laws . Sessions has integrity something which has not been the case BO
Yep, and Obama's DOJ didn't get that, or could care.
Why didn't you feel that way when Eric Holder ran roughshod over the American people and worked for Obama only
@SenFeinstein dems hypocrisy
Nothing like meeting with x prez on flight line. Now that's independence. U people r disgusting with ur political theater.
@SenFeinstein where have u been the last 8 years that this hasn't been true
@SenFeinstein Eric Holder was never independent and worked at the weems POTUS. You place a double standard on Sen. Sessions!
@SenFeinstein Did you just get back on the planet? Wow! Out of touch?
@SenFeinstein queen of sanctuary cities.. ah huh
@senfeinstein You do us proud!
LISTENING TO U DESCRIBING THE JOB OF AN AG 2 BAD U DIDN'T GIVE @LorettaLynch THE SAME SPEECH WHO HAS BEEN BIAS!
Did Obama know this?
@SenFeinstein is that why obama used TWO AGs against the American people and lawenfocement
Did you tell that to Obama, Lynch & Holder?
@SenFeinstein Oh like your buddie #Eric Holder? And now he is "helping" your home state CA. Politics as usual by #Dems.
.@JudiciaryDems Like Holder and Lynch ? Lying is why you lost.
@SenFeinstein amazing you can say that after supporting the partisan Eric holder
@SenFeinstein - that's why your democratic attorney general let Clinton go free after plane meeting lol
@SenFeinstein I'm so tired of liberals and their phony appearances. You need to retire and go to a nursing home old lady.
What about ethics? #NoEthicsNoHearing https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sessions-failed-to-disclose-oil-interests-as-required-ethics-experts-say/2017/01/09/56fdce24-d67c-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html?utm_term=.c7136c33d263 â€¦
@SenFeinstein So does that mean a Republican can't hold the job? #DoYourJob #Sessions #yeswecan
I agreed 100% 4 Sen. Dianne on such moral reminder.  Indeed, AG will not bias but remain true to moral account.

@SenFeinstein I guess Eric Holder never learned that lesson
@SenFeinstein - oppose Sessions for AG. Like @realDonaldTrump isn't fit for POTUS, Sessions not fit for AG!
please do not allow this man to have this very important job
