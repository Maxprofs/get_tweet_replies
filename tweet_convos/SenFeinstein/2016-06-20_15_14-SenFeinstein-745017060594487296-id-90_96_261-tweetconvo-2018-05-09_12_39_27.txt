Anti-American commie @SenFeinstein  thinks you're guilty until proven innocent!! http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/dianne-feinstein-americans-guilty-until-proven-innocent/ â€¦ #MolonLabe
@DrMartyFox @SenFeinstein FrankenFeinstein is PREMIER POSTER CHILD for Congressional Term Limits! #COSProject #neverhillary
thanks for your efforts! Heartbroken at GOP's lack of morals!
Proud that you and Barbara Boxer are my senators.
(((Dianne Feinstein))), you are a walking threat to the United States of America. Your agenda undermines everything American.
already treats the entire public like terrorists spying, collecting data, and restricting rights with limited to no oversight
Small town in Idaho. Muslim refugees rape and molest 5 yr old girl. You don't care
you're a phony i remember when you said if it was up to you nobody in america would have guns
.@SenFeinstein @Geoffrey2313819 @bryancrabtree - speech is germane to your program today. I think it's common sense. @producer_joey
- we found a lot we agreed about today 
There has to be a starting point Joey. I'm no liberal but this make sense.
what are we talking about ?
LOL @WenzWorldRadio This is from a month ago! Love you man! Great show today!
- haha! That's too funny!
My mother had Alzheimers for 5 years and during her last days she made more sense than you. We must prove our innocence Absurd
@YouTube you are just as corrupt as Crooked Hillary
what part of, Shall not be infringed upon, do you not understand? Didn't u take an oath to defend the constitution.
And how you wanted to deny Americans their right to Due Process.
Wow @SenFeinstein I just heard your interview. I can't believe you feel Americans are guilty until proven innocent.
//what "gun safety" we're talking about home turf here...we're seeing full out GW upon the folks here. If u get this, consider
Tyranny had an extremely ugly face
But a man who declares himself a terrorist and supports ISIS is not/ what form of liberal ass-hat are you??
Have you surrendered your guns yet???
What the hell do you mean we must prove our innocence? Did you get your law degree off the back of a Cherrios box?
Doesn't do any good if someone ISN'T put on the list, like Mateen, the Orlando murderer.
not sure if you heard this before but in America your innocent TILL proven guilty. Not "prove your innocent" but who cares eh?
This is America. We don't have to prove our innocence.  Time for you to get out...you've lost sight of what America is.
thank you for your vote!
You're a traitor to due process. Everything this country was founded upon. Your rule is ending. Long live the Constitution.
you spoke on senate floor to trample on and disregard due process! #2a
 Don't give up 
Traitor!
@YouTube How about stopping terrorists from entering or living in our country you dumb ass!
@YouTube 

As a constituent, when you propose to restrict any constitutional right without probable cause, I cannot support it
So sad this was voted down.  #Enough #DisarmHate
Guns are NOT the problem. Radical Islam is the problem here! Can you Libs understand that? Hello, earth to Libs
@YouTube failed! As it should have.
yOU TRIED MY HEART IS BROKEN SAD DAY FOR USA
Thank you for voting to #DisarmHate
Thank you so much for your representation! Please continue to fight against the terror gap & ban assault rifles in our country
@YouTube How are those very strict gun laws working for CA or Chicago or Paris?  Get the bad guys.  Bad guys don't abide laws.
@YouTube The AR15 is NOT a weapon of war..stop your lying propaganda
@YouTube a soldier asked to defend himself with an AR15 would say that they were being sent on a suicide mission
@YouTube as someone elected senator ad nauseum you of all people should know the difference between a rifle and a weaponofwar!
@YouTube The AR is nothing more than a rifle with the appearance of a military weapon
Keep up the fight! #Enough
@YouTube you evil vile,propagandist.To call an AR15 a weapon of war is to call our military the equal to ISLAMIC TERRORISTS!
problem is who controls that list, if it's the president or an appointed dept head, NO WAY! both sides will abuse the list.
which means the @FBI and @DHSgov will not mysteriously drop investigations into potential terrorists? #Enough
you are an amazing woman ..thank you for your tireless effort
Thank you for your continued efforts.
Come November we MUST vote those who chose to block sensible gun reform that would protect citizens, out. @NRA Cartel must go!
Hey, STUPID,
If you want to overcome the gun lobby, make an anti-gun lobby of your own.
DUH!
STOP pretending to care!

#guns
Thank you for continuing to try, @SenFeinstein @LoriSums In November we will vote the @SenateGOP out of office. #gunsense @SenateMajLdr
And brilliantly so. Tonight was disgraceful but millions of us will NOT let this go! Thank you, Senator.
Exactly.
You lost Loser. Come and Take It Traitor!!!
With proper judicial review for actual threats I support. But as of now, when people are added administratively, No. p4
Just indict them.  Then they can't pass guns until trial, or after if convicted.  Problem Solved.
Nuns, lawyers representing whistle blowers & accused of terrorism, journalists, and many others mistakenly added to it p3
The no fly list is an extremely problematic non-judicial process to be used to suspend constitutional rights. pt2
applaud the intent, but it needs a lot of work before I can support it. pt1
Thank you @SenFeinstein It is both sad and stomach churning that your attempt to #DisarmHate was rejected. Please continue trying!!
Thank you for your leadership on this issue! Please keep fighting - I'm there with you! #Enough
Traitors.
WADR, after the #IRS scandal, whats from stopping #Democrats from using Terror-WL to put gun owners on there? 

Nothing
@YouTube thank you from the majority of Americans who wanted this
thank you!!
all of you have failed US - again.
Keeping terrorists out of our country would be just as effective!!
When will the crooked politicians go after gang members with guns? Are those guns ok? Limousine liberals are such hypocrites!
Thank you for trying. So depressing that it went nowhere. The Senate Republicans should be ashamed. Please do not stop trying!
/@SenFeinstein You dont CARE about terrorists w/guns, else y r I so EAGER to IMPORT the Muslim filth? What YOU want is to disarm ME.
The bigger question is why you're allowing terrorists in the US at all
who puts ppl on terror list? Who is in charge of list? Recently, Dr Ben Carson was on a hate group list, so is it political?
Thank you for working so diligently to try and make this happen.
Thank you. This is why I keep voting for you! #Enough
So you're saying we will lose our 2nd Amendment rights because of Muslims?
don't be such a ninny! Nobody said nor implied that. Unless of course you have something to hide?
Well, Bob, a jihadi killed 50 people and Dianne wants to take my Constitutional right away.  Pretty simple.
that is only partly correct. But you don't have to worry because nothing will pass so murders are uninterrupted
thank you Senator. Your constituents are behind you. #DisarmHate #Enough #CAproud
Thanks for trying.
