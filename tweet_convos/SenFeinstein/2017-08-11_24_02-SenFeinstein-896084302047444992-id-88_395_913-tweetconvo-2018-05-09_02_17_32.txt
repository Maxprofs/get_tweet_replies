Please support #MedicareForAll universal healthcare, which would provide _everyone_ in the USA healthcare: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors ….
As you know: Most Americans & a larger majority of Californians want universal healthcare.  #SaveTheACA, but don't stop with half measures.
That BS. We want honest elections Michael with less govt. STOP taxing us to pay for everyone else. What is wrong with you. Head injurious??
Countries with universal healthcare have better healthcare at lower cost per person than we currently pay in the USA.
So if you want to save money, _support #MedicareForAll_ : http://commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/in-the-literature/2013/nov/pdf_schoen_2013_ihp_survey_chartpack_final.pdfs … .
And support for universal healthcare among Americans is ~55%: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/ … , http://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/data-note-modestly-strong-but-malleable-support-for-single-payer-health-care/?utm_content=57083000&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … , http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx ….
Links are to recent polls, which find support for universal healthcare ranging from 53% to 58% with ±3% uncertainty in each poll.
Finally: Cut out the ableist lines.
Dear Sen., Anything that is not drafting articles of impeachment or 25th Amend. is derelict of duties. Going to get us all killed.  #NKorea
Impeachment starts in the House.  Tell your Rep to work to #ImpeachTrump, so that the Senate can remove him.
TY. I write to my Rep about impeachment often.  Unfortunately he is a Republican &says we have to wait for M's investigation. Worried re NK
Keep applying political pressure.  GOP Reps will support impeachment when they understand that they will lose office otherwise.
If you want to decrease cost then train more doctors and nurses. Supply and demand. California college students can't get in these programs.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Rather see de-escalation on NK&velenzuela. Trump wants nuke war. Impeach now, senator, before it's too late!
Agricultural workers are being sent away while those Corporations hire temporary immigrants to work. Total Insanity
Wait what?  I thought health coverage was already a Fed requirement?  And we've heard all we neee to from the a Dems on reduced premiums! 
No. Universal Healthcare is the ONLY viable solution...our nation is PAST DUE! #UniversalHealthcare
yes please let's give the government control over another thing to f*** us up. #AtlasMD simple $50
Did you write this after meeting w/healthcare lobbyists!?Support Bernie's bill!Quit selling out people. Quit using GOP lies abt Medicare!
I like the idea about helping MORE not LESS.
Looks like a reasonable step in the right direction.  Thank you- seriously thank you.
How about 'em... stopping nukes from falling on our heads?
What about when y'all  (democrats) passed Obamacare without reading it or checking it's cost first.?

HOW was that better.???
Your hypocrisy is astounding. You blast Republicans for doing exactly what Democrats do when they are in the majority.
Push
1.2 million? What about the other 356.5 million in the US? AAA looking out for your buddies. Par for the course #Resign
And how did that Agricultural Immigration Bill work ? It's failed all those workers
Congress is not qualified to reform Healthcare as a whole. They need real professionals
Yeah, well we see how those previous Bills worked out. They didn't
Right
Thank you Sen.Feinstein for working hard for our healthcare. Many of us Americans appreciate you and others. #Bipartisanship working 2gether
"MY" bill???  You're just full of yourself!   No one else worked on this? Elitist statement!
Why did you never bring this up when Obamacare was falling apart before the election??? And I want an answer!!!

@potus actually no matter what 360 million people will die... I'm sure it's the Republicans fault #LOL
Health Care should be an all inclusive public service to all Americans, cradle to grave.
how do people exist without understanding how an economy works. Why should I pay for your Healthcare
No, I will not read your crap bill. #SinglePayer or there will be a massive @DemExit
How about assuring your reelection by pushing for single payer?
The only way to fix healthcare is to get rid of this congess subsidies
Californias demographics are a lot different then demographics in the other 49 states a centralized plan won't work...
My FAVORITE tweet about ObamaCare
If it's not repealing Obamacare you can keep it.
Sounds more like more tax payer dollars for Medicaid
Another DA heard from !!! You voted for the Obama sabotage !!!
Thank you
@FoxNews Isn't it time your viewers heard another opinion besides the tabloid TV you constantly shovel out?
Propaganda didn't work well in the end in Nazi Germany
it won't work your not ready to give up the kick backs you get from obamacare.Screw the middle class with high premiums and co-pays

Keep government out of health care.
Again with the words. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT. publish your bill so we can see if you really have anything besides threats and random demands
@SenFeinstein small tweaks to the ACA are not a long term solution. Please support single payer Medicare for all and fight hard for it.
We have all heard the reduced premiums promise along with you can keep your doctor and plan lies. Please stop. #stayinschoolkids
9.69% of my salary. We need universal health care.
Will you read it first before you pass it unlike Obamacare?
A 20% increase would be welcomed change to the 34% increase I received last year under the ACA. My coverage decreased as well.
The ACA is a huge welfare program and transfer of wealth...and you know it. So what do you propose: throw more money down the rabbitt hole

What i want to know has Dr Ronny L Jackson examined the President and why has the report not been released
How about you fight for single payer instead?  That would ensure coverage for everyone.  Every. Single. Person.
take a nap lady
PROMOTE TRUTH DIANE SINGLE PAYER WITH DENTAL &MEDS. CIRCUMVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES YOUR $ DONERS. 1st SUPPORT VOTERS NOT BIG PHARMA FOR ONCE
We need full repeal of ACA. We need free-market capitalism to control health care. Get big government the hell outta regulating insurance.
#Liar
will go on kt with them.....no thats what i  thought
Sounds like a good first step. Need stability now. Are ins cos and docs on board? Bipartisan sponsorship?
Senator, you miss the fundamental issue- regulate health care providers, NOT PATIENTS!
Trump will only sabotage any efforts connected to the ACAbut I will keep my fingers crossed that the adults will come up with a plan
Thank you for staying the straight course amid the chaos!
Democrats could lose 2018 votes without strong support for all inclusive single payer. Zero Tolerance for corporate shills.
So is this medicare for 50+ yo's?
After the Trump&McConnell affordable care act becomes law , More and more people will be on food stamps and welfare.
FOCUS on the 11 counties in Calif that have more registered voters than people of age to vote. We are watching you.
Get the govt OUT OF HEALTH CARE! Fed govt can't run anything efficiently except military. Sort of! Make PRIVATE coverage easy! Less regs!
It looks ok I hope bipartisan will work with you. Bring professionals in to speak
Focus on CA. You will NEVER get something passed nationally without fatal compromises with the right. Let's be an example for other states
Thank you Senator Feinstein for your tireless work - wether it be health care or nat'l security you never stop. It's noticed & appreciated.
I could get on board



Feinstein you've got to quit talking out of the face you sit on drain the swamp remove the illegals away with your base


Decreased costs for them but increases for the rest of us, Dianne Feinstein is corrupt


Why not support Medicare for All, which solves ALL this problem? Oh right cuz of your fundraising
No its because comb over TRUMP IS RICH & DON'T  GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, & BY THE TRUMP SUCK'S, FUCK THE SYSTEM!!!!!
Rich ppl are not the enemy. Who else pays the big taxes for all food stampers?
Only real thing that will work is #MedicareForAll  .... start now to lower the age of coverage to 55
What do you think about Rep John Larson;'s @RepJohnLarson bill in the House?  Seems pretty comprehensive and doable...at least a good start
#FullRepeal #noBailout
