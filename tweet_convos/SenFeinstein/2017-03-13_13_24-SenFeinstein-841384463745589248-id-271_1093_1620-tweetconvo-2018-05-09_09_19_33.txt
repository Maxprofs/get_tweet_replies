why are you & rest of Democrats legitimatizing Gorsuch as possible Supreme Court Judge?  Trump is under investigation!
They are hardly old. Nonetheless, this is BS! We want this bill blocked and Ryan, Pence and Trump impeached.
,one in every bunch
Your comment makes no sense. Standard fare from GOP voters...
,I'm having a conversation,with someone I HAVE NOT ASK FOR THAT REMARK,THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT
Don't be complicit in pinning this on one person. This is a Republican Party failure. They had 8 years: This is #RepubliCare
What was found for young women--who may lose prenatal care and reproductive healthcare without planned parenthood? Expand #ACA

Removing young people from the insurance pool is a catastrophe. They're relatively healthy, driving premiums down for others.

Why is that other people's responsibility? I support taking care of the disabled. I support the abled taking care of themselves.

This will annihilate the United States. It is one of the numbers that don't add up. It will cost lives and real cash
not just Californians!
well, perhaps they can join the sanctuary system since that is the california priority
You and Grassley hiding behind what? National security? People deserve to know truth from DOJ, Comey, FBI but we get nothing.
You were my supervisor, mayor, senator and my favorite politician. Now you're unavailable and hiding and one of the old boys.

No to #trumpcare #ryancare
Thank you, Senator Feinstein!
hey Dianna let's concentrate on reducing actual healthcare costs. Not covering them up.
Is not extending Medicare the right solution for 55-65? This is a vulnerable class and can fall into poverty easily.
Trump care must not pass.
You have been briefed on Trump. If u have info to stop him, PLEASE act NOW! #Resist
Definately not happy to here this.  There are a lot of us in that age bracket. Hopefully the 12 GOP that say nope will stand.
putkin/trump lied about President Obama he betrayed the oath of office impeachment for this distraction to or democracy
But, on a serious note, I will always love you for your actions after George was killed. I love you! Forever!
Dianne! You haven't been following. If they can't pay for their own health care, they're supposed to die! Get with the program
Shameful fear mongering. OBAMA Care has hurt millions. Are you or yours covered with OBAMA Care? Respectfully, a former Dem.
THE DEMS MUST DO A PRESS CONF OR RALLY. "MEND NOT END" IS YOUR MOTTO. HAVE IDEAS TO FIX AND TALK POSITIVE 99% OF TIME 4 HOPE.
Please have the Democrats plan to fix the ACA ready to propose!  Submit our plan now.
I'm 64 1/2 it'll literally kill me.  NC .  Hope I keep my coverage till I hit 65 for medicare...er if that's still around.
My premiums went from $400 per mo. & 1,000 Ded. to $100 per month w/ACA and no Ded. I can't use tax credits of Trump-plan. Bad
have Governor Brown to lay out a plan for single payer insurance get rid of for profit insurance.
Hmmmm - isn't "#TrumpCare" a oxymoron? @SenFeinstein
most of them voted Trump, this is what they voted for and wanted
Combine that with what will surely be an attack on social security and those of us over 50 are in for a world of hurt. Help!
same effin robo tweet really is that all u have???
This is a travesty. People will opt not to get insurance. Hopefully, it won't go through.
The older ones will be #screwed @SpeakerRyan ~ NO THANKS...
fake news!!!!
And people in Arizona have a 100% increase under Obamacare!! Tell that to your constituents!!
As a bookstore owner I need to be able to join other bk sellers and buy across state lines.

My Congressman, @RepJohnFaso , better be voting NO or he is HISTORY in 2018!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes Trump care is horrible. Now what?
And since Elderly went for Trump 53-45, I'm having hard time feeling much sympathy.
You continue to use incorrect info & scare tactics. Shame on you. You win the award for worst Senator ever
correct! Under O-care 30% ,while our "friends" in congress can get up to 75% subsidy waver @ 174,000 a yr pay !Medicare 4 all
I hope you guys are working on the fixes for the ACA. Don't just complain make that you have revisions.I am hopeful.
liar
It shows how he wants to squeeze people in need, he has no concern for citizens. Greed a highest level being demonstrated
@RitaBuffington Anyone eligible for an AARP card. Trumps cure-Just deny elders medical so they all die off?
- That is just not right. Hurt them before doing on Medicare. Doesn't make any sense at all!!
What's your tax bracket?  I hope more than @SenSanders 13.5%.
#Trump's #healthcare plan has nothing to do with health or care. Im a UK conservative but I love our #NHS with its faults.
pretend you care about America, will you ma'am. We know that being American is an embarrassment to you, your words, ma'am.
What a hypocrite marriage fraud committed by U.S. judges is unlawful address this problem "rubber stamp document" is illegal.
If the the ACA is so good, why did you and your ilk vote to exempt yourselves from it? Democrats are hypocrites.
Put your money where your mouth is, lets see you sign up for the ACA. Career politicians like you are part of the problem.
Democrats believe that the ACA is so good, they have to force you to buy it.
Older people would have been fine if you criminals hadn't robbed social security.
please fight for us!

Why just Californians? Are they special?  What about all the other States? #obamacrap hurts me at age 50. Not from Cali
@polandmary21 It's legalized genocide. The poor, elderly & sick can no longer contribute to society so get rid of them.
please keep fighting for us!
What about Obama's cutting Medicare Senator, U didn't care about that did you! Hypocrite
we need to save medicaid too.
Record of your fuckups during your tenure as a US senator are incomplete.. You must provide them!!!
all older Americans Senator. All
That's ther way of thanking your state 4 not voting for him!We need it to affect the places that did vote hardest
It is really #TrumpDontCare
that's because the Dems won't cooperate
Ryan's plan should be called Law Of The Jungle Heathcare
we will be like a BANANA REPUBLIC more sick and hungry like a DICTATORSHIP wow this is cracy
Keep fighting Senator.
there is no one left in Calif any more they are all young dummy movie stars on drugs
@POTUS Quiz - What other country in the world penalizes its citizens for not buying insurance? Name one.
DF you need help. Please read for a change for some one is old DF. Sad you try to make a point and dont
Remind voters than because of Trumpcare 60-64's will have a harder time finding jobs with employer paid health benefits.
They'd be fine if you greedy SOB's hadn't stolen from Social Security. #PayitBack
As opposed to forcing young people to pay not only into your ponzi social security system, but the insolvent medicare system..
Did you know that not only am I not even going to make 0% my "investment" in SS, but I don't even have a guaranteed pay out?
I like free stuff too
They are already hit hardest under ObamaCare. If they are still employed their premiums are in $$$$$.
but...according to @PressSec @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Fair because at least they are not paying for maternity care
I doubt it! They're really hit by the high cost of living and lack of jobs.  Like most other Californians.  Except illegals!
spending all your time tweets instead of working. the govt should not be in the health care business. period
This is not health care bill. It's transference of wealth from poorest, most vulnerable (children w/disabilities) to richest.
Reverse Robin Hood. Steal from the poor and give to the rich
hit ..run over ...and buried by it!
Do you still think we should work in a bipartisan manner?  Resist or Resign.
good news that's me I'm 63 & in Cali
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP

STOP WHINING! 
Work together like adults to #MAGA 
#Pray4DJT
So much for their values and concerns
well, your beloved Obamacare sure has sucked for me and my 63 year old husband. His choice is ACA or VA & you've screwed both^
Unfortunately that because they use it the most. This is how insurance works it's basic math
Something needs to change! ACA costs are so high we can't get past the deductible to get to care. So we spend money and have no benefits?
but hey, Paul Ryan finally makes good on his 2009 promise to replace Obamacare! I think he's gone insane with his obsession...
ObamaCare architect says #ACA passed thanks to "lack of transparency""stupidity of the American voter"
sucks to be in a state like that
