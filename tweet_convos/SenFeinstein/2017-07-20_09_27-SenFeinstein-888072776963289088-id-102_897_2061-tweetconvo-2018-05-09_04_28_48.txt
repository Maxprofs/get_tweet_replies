My op-ed in @TheHill examines why California and the nation can’t afford Republicans’ so-called health reform:
What have u done in the last 7 years to stop the collapse of AFA?  Nothing except write op-eds.  U are best reason to fight for TERM LIMITS!
I have difficulty understanding why political speak for trying to reduce the rapid growth of spending is described as a draconian cut?
I've called all 20 of these traitors. Got 17. Do it every day. Takes 30 minutes, small price to save millions of Americans!
Vigilance won't protect us from McConnell. Man your battlestations.
Keep at it. Trump is the worse president in my life time. I am 62.
Why do you lie
You are so right they are afraid to hold Town Hall meetings with the issue of healthcare
What would happen if Americans boycott all health ins in protest to this mania?  We just refuse to pay our med bills, ALL of us
Or our taxes.
At least your representing the people the don't want better for the u.s . Wait, you represent yourself. Represent your people, not your $
Go in and present a new plan to 45 if you have too,,,,,,,i really think you don't that is why nothing is happening

The goal for everyone is to lower the fucking cost, do you agree with that? If so the FM is the only that can provide low cost and quality
Louder
Dianne  your getting lazy and greedy your time is has come and past. Step up or get outta of way. Theirs people that have dreams out here.
Says the troll with two followers. Republicans are the greedy ones.
How many now babe after only 1 day humm some kinda troll
The goal is guilt free genocide. Without sick, poor or aging.. every problem in dystopic society is solved. our lives depend on what you do.
GOP Population Control
Medicaid helps one person, NOT the user
The goal is clear. If we an stop progress, than we stop progress. This goes for all House and Senate. Thanks for nothing
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!
That's a complete lie.  Obama gutted Medicare to pay for the ACA, now everything is going up, and even Medicare patients are paying more.
Be vigilant, standby, and do nothing as usual!
Medicaid is a terrible joke on the American people. It is a massive waste for taxpayers without even helping people on it.
If Obamacare is so good why do not you sign up for it?

@GOP hellbent on taking insurance away from millions.
Ask yourself why so many need medicaid? Shouldn't the goal be to reduce the citizens dependency?  Who's the real commy socialist party?
@GOP needs that $800 billion in Medicaid cuts to pay for its trillion $ tax cut for the rich ! #trumpcare
Because Obamacare is so good and working so well for millions of Americans providing low cost Affordable care.
I loved my Dr I loved my plan
Scam artist. Almost all of you politicians in America are scam artist. Ride's almost over. Crowd source the truth.
Had an illegal alien run stop sign hitting my child 2 wks ago. Alien had no car insur or license-NO ENGLISH.-would like her m/caid removed!
I want the 80/20 Rule to remain.
Improve job prospects, get people to work so they don't need Medicaid.  What is wrong with that goal?
Looking for votes with your old scare tactics... Dianne  ??
Purge the Medicaid rolls of the parasites.
Liar. Obstructionist .
They must repeal Obamacare
80% of Dems want Medicare for All so lets do that
@GOP brainwashing > poor are poor b/c they can game sys. Never enters their mind societal policies/laws in place to prevent poor to advance.
Also possible to try and underfund Medicaid through the Budget....
One thing I'll say for you Democrats - you really do all hang tough together, every single one of you is corrupt. #ObamaCare
Dems should make an open and publicized offer to work w Repubs on a single payer plan to include all of Congress! (No separate plan)
If you mean a smaller increase is gutting something, yes.
When did the republicants become the Red party? Not too many years ago they said Better dead than Red!
Thanks for staying on top of this Senator...keep pushing to improve the #ACA.
cc: @SenKamalaHarris
LIAR
Must protect you're illegals!
Drop the rhetoric Danny!  Y are you backing a disaster...just because its from your side of the isle!  Come on!
The Medicaid program was designed to help the elderly and disabled not for the middle class It's expansion is unsustainable And you know tha
Why haven't you looked at the issue of so many being on medicaid in the first place?
@SenSanders has been saying this for a decade.
Paul Ryan said that was his goal since college? What kind of person has a goal like that?
The national debt has increased 500% under your watch.  Thanks.
I know that you probably have dementia, but how in the world is over 700 BILLION gutting Medicaid? Please gut me like that!!
You were fine with harming me and my family in 2010! Only some Americans matter to you and your ilk  fake Drama
Medicaid has 28$ trillion in unfunded liabilities. The VA is proof single payer will not work.
You're a dam liar and Medicaid will collapse during your retirement.
Give Americans what we give Congress! Your insurance helped @SenJohnMcCain with his care and the finding of his cancer. We all deserve this!
If Republicans get their wish & gut Medicaid, they will come after Social Security next.
Better not.
Thank you! Keep fighting for us!!!
@SenFeinstein with insurers leaving federal #AHC the option will be muted--and private insurance reign at higher cost and more than 32M w/o
This is a BLATANT LIE.@CongressEthicsWhy do you allow Feinstein, Warren, Waters etc Dems break Ethics laws w/false tweets?
We will be vigilant Senator & totally appreciate the fact that you will be too!
Why can't big tobacco be taxed to pay for health care? They have contributed to so many health problems and death.
then please produce something better then this and Obamacare, easy to bad mouth anything when you don't have a plan
I'm a constituent. Zip & name in handle. Plz talk w/ GOP brave women Senators. Takes one to know one. Stand firm: good healthcare for all.


everyone should have the same HEALTHCARE insurance and paid leave as you
Senator, the fact Insurers are dropping out of Obamacare, leaving many States with only 1 insurer, should be your top priority!
The GOP goal is to get full-time jobs (not part-time jobs like under Obama) so the ridiculously high # of ppl on Medicaid can drop.
Need to take fraud out of medicaid & medicare. ESPECIALLY medicare where I know so many srs. who overuse services w drs bcause it's "free"
Thank you for your leadership Sen Feinstein!!
SLOWING THE GROWTH OF MEDICAID IS NECESSARY. $20 Trillion debt. Stop importing poverty & address waste/fraud/abuse.
Yes, Senator Feinstein, the goal of Republicans is very clear: destroy Medicaid for all but them.
.@SenFeinstein Please don't let them dump 23 million off healthcare


Repeal Obamacare NOW! #CaitlynForCA
U WILL NEVER b elected.  Go back to your fake family.
Me? I'm not Caitlyn Jenner. 
However, she will UNseat Dianne Feinstein in 2018. 
Only 12% of Americans want to repeal Obamacare. It will be blamed on Republicans. She definitely WON'T win
