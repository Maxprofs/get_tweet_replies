How about you fight for single payer? The stakes are higher and the need greater...
If shorty healthcare is short for single payer, then yes
You are
Are you making fun of what I do for a living?  Wow
Please push as hard as you possibly can,  and figure out a much better proposal!
Shut it down! #TheResistance stands united with you. #NoTrumpCare
Thank you all for caring enough to do this. I'm 60 and I stand to lose my insurance.
#HoldThefloor #HoldThemAccountable
Congress has a choice-protect the health of the American people or protect health insurance companies & tax cuts for the rich. SINGLE PAYER!
I didn't serve to see my country suffer over pennies ripping healthcare! shame on republicans @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenateMajLdr
#stoplisteningtoMSM
how did it feel losing all the special elections! Pay attention to the voters!
Does that include Filibuster by amendment?
THANK YOU 
As one of your many constituents I just want to say I am behind you 100%. Don't let them do this.
Thank you, Senator Feinstein! We need more champions like you in Congress!
Stop the resistance! Work together!!! #fedupwiththfeds #demsgetaclue #whydidulose
She's been in this role a gazillion years. Cut the crap talk and actually do something. Ugh.
Thank you  I am one of the millions who could become more sick without medical or prescription coverage.
You are my Senator, I'm counting on you to #holdthefloor with everything you've got! Thank you!Thank our fellow democrats and allies too.
Go get 'em Senator! The nation is behind you!
As long as the Democrats fight back with civility we will be systematically wiped out... get some damn guts and start swinging
U R A FOOL!!
Now is the time to call for single payer healthcare system loud and clear everyday. Don't let this moment pass without speaking out for it.
Thank you, Senator. Continue to withold consent. Drown it in amendments. Speak out #HoldTheFloor
thank you for your hard work, your big heart, and brilliance 
With senate Dems! #HoldTheFloor
You are our champion! #HoldTheFloor
#HoldTheFloor
Keep going! And thank you! #HoldTheFloor

LOVE this.
The Dems bulldozed Obamacare through without hearings or public debate.
So proud of my democracy today!
thank you to you and Kamala for doing what you can for your constituents!  We appreciate you!
They have the majority in both chambers of Congress+hold the WH
Dem's better get on the Progressive train bef 2018 or lose our Democracy
Start yelling!!  You and Schumer are too soft spoken about this major crisis!!
Please Please fight them - they want to kill us !!!
Thanks for being outspoken on this, Senator! But we must take back Senate to end this horror. Rep values r finally on display for all to see
Please do!
They will continue down this path, they don't have anybody to lead them any other way. So fight like my life depends on it, b-cuz it does.
Remember Senator Pelosi, "We have to pass it before we know what's in it!" It was OK then but not now? Payback is a _ itch!
Thank you for keeping up the fight!
This is our point of rage. All must stand for our children, for our parents, for our vets, for our disabled, for all our people. Rage.
it's MORE people who DON'T donate money who need to be approached, not just home owners,  aproach the drunk/drug addict, McDonald's worker
what dems r not doing: going 2 the people who DON'T usually vote, n the ghettos, n the backwoods,  the under-educated, the extreme poor, etc
What happened to your 'willingness to work ' with them? Hypocrite
I support your fight Senator Feinstein! Thank you for this tireless work. I know all the Dem Senators must be exhausted for dealing with 45.
The 83% of Americans who do NOT like the Republican "repeal-replace bill" are counting on you to block it any way you can.
And we CAN'T let conflicts in Syria distract us from the most important domestic policy decision.
Dear Dianne, under the ACA we were promised lower premiums and better care. Neither happened. Why do we believe you now?
Thanks u! Keep fighting for all the lives u will save!
Ahhhhh yea, fight all u want u don't have the power or votes Huge Forehead @SenFrankenFeinstein 
Thank you! Keep up the great work
Thank you, Senator Feinstein, for fighting for us!
We will have to fight no matter what.  You know
 the Reps. will give the the people NOTHING.
Greetings. I hope you have much. Good luck.
I think it is time to call in the military and remove Trump, his cabinet and the GOP by force.
Thank you! #HoldTheFloor
Republicans are not our friends!!
They have been bought and sold by the Koch bros, wall st. Oil, Russia...Follow the money. Worry and fight for us and our lives.
Do not wait!Do it now!.fight them tooth and nail.Throw everything at em.They worship greed.They have no allegience to us or country.#Help Us

I hope you're right that there are those who will stand up to KIng Donald
73% want #AHCA discussed in open 76% don't know what AHCA will do 59% want #ACA improved 13 Senators in shadows hide - keep on fighting
PLEASE DO!!
Thank you!
NEGOTIATE!  DO YOUR JOB!
thank you
Too little too late. If this bill passes Schumer, Pelosi need to resign. New leaders needed now. #fedup
Kill this dirty bill. Why cant they produce a good bill for all?
And we'll be behind you ALL THE WAY
Fight @#SenateDems no to healthcare bill. #showthebill .
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you for being there for us.

Please do. Please do.
I'm with you. And all decent americans should follow the Senator, she fights for our rights.
fight it with all you have? What exactly is that?
We need universal healthcare like the rest of the world
"If", they are doing it! Better get the heavy artillery ready to go. This battle will effect every american. Can't trust McConnell, Dump,GOP
@GOP is the #DumbingDown of America!
Does that include Democrats getting out and voting in the states they lost? Because that's kind of how a republic works.
It also includes reversing the horrific republican jerrymandering that makes each democrat vote worth less than republican votes 
Yeah I'm a Republican but gerrymandering is messed up.
#HoldTheFloor  thank you
Thank you!  We're counting on...and standing with you!
Our Dem reps keep saying that and yet the Repubs keep passing whatever they want. It's fun to get screwed because you're not rich!
Thank you Senator! Fight like hell. We're behind you.
Thank you Senator. In times like this the people rely so strongly on the strength of our defenders.
Thank you for all of your hard work Senator  Feinstein
God bless you both.
The only way to fight is to defeat the Republican in 2018 election. But to do the DNC need to clean up, demonstrate honest operations.
Senate Ds threatening obstruction this week.  But what's new? They refuse to lift a finger to help with runaway premiums under Obamacare.
You are outnumbered!
Thank you as you #HoldTheFloor.
Thank you.
Fight like our lives depend on it. Please. We'll back you all the way. #HoldTheFloor #SaveACA #NoHearingNoVote #ShowUsTheBill
remove the option for members to "opt out"...I imagine a MUCH better bill comes to the table.
The Republicans are behaving like characters in a dark comedy-
keep up the good work! Submit as many amendments as possible!
Thank you Senator.  #HoldTheFloor
...@theDEMocrats are gonna fight this bill with everything they have? ohgodz..are we in trouble..HELP!!

Wanna do right by US? #Medicare4ALL
You can #holdthefloor all you want --the more you cry the more we have to remind you we have #majority so how bout working together ?

 literally insane.
Thank you, Senator!

Thank you Senator. Keep fighting for California and the nation.
Wow! Obamacare crashed & just about all providers jumped ship - a total failure - this is a deceitful act by @SenFeinstein.

Thank you!!
filibuster with thousands of amendments!
GOP will pass their bill just like the Dems passed Obamacare, without any help from the opposing party.  #electionshaveconsequences
thank you, @SenFeinstein for ur true American heroism in the face of greed and misconduct!
Senator Feinstein: Push the full vote past July 4 Recess, so Dems can threaten & hold Debt Ceiling as Wedge to Drop #AHCA
Risk losing yr job. Do wateva u hv to
Thank you Sen Feinstein
Thank you!
Thank you @SenFeinstein
TY and please amend this bill for as long as it takes to delay it. #HoldTheFloor
#HoldTheFloor @GOP @SenateGOP a disgrace for not allowing transparency #ShowUsTheBill Why exempt Congress if it's great healthcare?
GOOD. GO FOR IT. 
You want to fix things? Make legislature subject to the same laws they pass for the populous. Social security, health care will be fixed.
we need a better system and I don't care if both parties decide,but going this way, will have four years added to eight of failed policies
You let Obama ram Obama care gown our throats and didn't know everything about it, where were you than, and believe me it is a failure
Do it.
#HoldTheFloor thank you for fighting. Plz do all you can to delay vote until after the recess. GOP must face their constituents on this!
Oh definitely... if they don't do the right thing, & vote, no on it, they may risk loosing their seats next year in the mid term's!
Thank you.
Thank you
Sen. Feinstein you are my hero!
Thank you Sen. Feinstein!

You guys are vampires. I thought you were afraid of stakes... and crosses, and holy water...
the Dems are acting.  Do you really feel this is the right way to act or should you all grow up and work together as it is suppose to be
You are suppose to represent the people not have a knock down dray out fight having Republicains against Democrats.  It is horrible how the
#Terror #Help
You must withhold unanimous consent and filibuster by amendment!
Keep up the fight! Thank you!

You'd better, Senator.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you @SenFeinstein #WeThePeople need our Healthcare! When they pass it, please amendment it to death!
Heads Up @GOP, if by some cataclysmic chance you manage to pass AHCA, we're going to flood the shit out of it with lawsuits across the USA!
It is possible GOP will see handwriting on wall and realize 2018 will be bloodbath for them if the refuse to be reasonable. Thank you!
Thank you for your hard work #keepupthegoodfight

Senator, are you aware that Trump has been working a deal with Russian oligarchs to invest in American Health Care
Explain the $400 billion single payer healthcare bill that you and Governor Brown are proposing in California ? Taxpayers did not vote for ?
Thank you @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris!! Please do whatever you can do to stop this. We appreciate your efforts!
If? If? The rest of the world is incredulous of your ongoing inaction.
Please take good care of yourself and rest. We need you in this fight, Senator. Thank you for being so wonderful and so strong.
