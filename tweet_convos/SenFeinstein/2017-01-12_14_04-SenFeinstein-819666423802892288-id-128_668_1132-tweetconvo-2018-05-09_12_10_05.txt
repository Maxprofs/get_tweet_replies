Shame on you for scaring people.  The GOP is not going to simply repeal ACA and do nothing.
Patrick my friend...they just did.
Nope.  There is not currently a vacuum where ACA was.  And there will not be.
uhh...

Of course people are worried. Dems are scaring them. GOP will not take away access to healthcare
Dem propaganda. The GOP is often stupid but not that stupid.
no its not propoganda. It's researched and sourced onfo. What you have to prove it won't be chaos?
No one has proof of anything. I'm telling you what I think. And there are specific aspects GOP has said they will retain
@braaaaiiinnns I watched a town hall where Paul Ryan smirked while a man told him he'd had cancer & ACA saved his life.
SMIRKED! What kind of a monster is he???
One that grins when a man says he would have died w/o ACA please don't repeal it & does so anyway.
Christian Good Samaratin kinda guy who helps heal people like Jesus did. #TheResistance
#ACA  You shouldn't even show up to vote for the CANADIAN DRUGS. WHY?????????
@foreveringrid don't worry trump just promised universal care for all Americans. Just hold him to that promise
. Hope that for once he does not lie
get people to work and STOP nanny state!!!
thank you for opposing the repeal of the ACA! Keep up the good work :)
http://www.msfanpage.link/dianne-feinsteins-husband-wins-near-billion-dollar-california-high-speed-rail-contract/ … you can kiss the ACA goodbye
Sweetie, CA will secede and take care of everyone.  Good bye Ca.  Oh by the way federal lands & military bases are ours.
I was saved by the ACA when I had an acute MI in the hospital. So yes, Obamacare saves American lives! - Kris in Oceanside
you know what...than get it for yourself and your family.... !!!
Meanwhile,
IRS letters warn millions about health insurance penalty #LiveOnK2 http://katu.com/news/nation-world/irs-letters-warn-millions-about-health-insurance-penalty … 
thousands were punished for being too poor to afford ACA. fair?
OH YES, my part time co-worker has much better insurance than me with 22 yrs. exp. ALL AMERICANS COULD NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY...
@braaaaiiinnns Trump isn't repealing ACA - Congress is. Pls contact your rep & sen & tell them not to repeal obamacare. PLS RT
it won't be taken away-it will be made better & more affordable- calm down-they are working on it(unlike dems-pass b4 reading)
That means, you have limited access to the masses. In NC + other states, only one Co. still offers Obama Care. No competition
and millions got increases not the 2500 the lying s bag odumma promised. Stupid liberal scum
Keep fighting! Please advise us of specific actions we can do to help. I hope you are feeling better after surgery! #saveACA

Demand to have the same health insurance plan that congress has, or that they are restricted to use whatever plan they adopt for us!
We back you up 100%. The safeguards of the ACA are lifesavers, despite many people not understanding. They will once it's gone though...
Obama care sucks.
because millions of Americans are PAYING for others.  Our family cannot sustain these costs and deductibles.
you and  Pelosi are making a huge profit off of covered CA. My sister in your neck of the woods pays 900.mo because of ACA!!
<<<<<George Soros connected.
maybe you don't hear so good...it's a failure! Needs to be repealed and replaced. It will be read this time.
TOTALLY AGREE!!!!!
Garbage. The ACA was the worst political bill ever passed; none of you life long "political hacks" understand healthcare.
Umm, except you DIDN'T VOTE FOR IT JUST LAST WEEK. Ironically you were having a medical procedure. Glad you have health care.
"CONGRESS FIRST" Congress must cancel their own health insurance immediately upon passing repeal of any part of ACA.
ABSOLUTELY. #UnInsureCongress
well I'm glad the pres-elect is gonna repeal it. It should have never been passed to begin with. It was voted on illegally
Before ACA, I had premiums of $330/mo./$1,000 deductible. Now I pay $567/month w/ $7,200 deductible. How is this affordable???
@NBC Meet The Press, Watching Sen.Dianne Feinstein, A Blessed Sunday to you.
My son went from having a $67/mo to $360 a month with a $15K deductible. He can't afford that on his salary. He just turned 26
no it wouldnt it would be like you stealing money from the widows and orphans to give to your husbands company. Wouldnt it?
You and all Democratic senators need to boycott his inauguration. I am lifelong Dem and you all need to have some backbone!!
@Jodzio Whats wrong with this woman does she not realize America needs another battle ship and so many bigger bombs Jeez!
Thank you #LovefromIndiana
Why dont you and other democrats have a CNN town hall meeting like Ryan did & let America know repealing ACA affects EVERYONE!
@Destroy_ALEC @SenFeinstein @MeetThePress this was such an great interview.We need to be vigilant read/watch everything
Pls join the inauguration boycott. Trump's hateful and ignorant remarks about Cong. Lewis are shameful, and clearly racist.
Why didn't you vote? Am one of your supporters, but was wondering. Floods in home district?
keep up the good fight. We're with you.
senator please investigate trump collusion with putkin postpone inauguration until all Americans know the truth
. Mouthing like mass murder preceded by pain and suffering
@SenFeinsteincorrection: Nothing like mass murder............
Thank you for fighting for our healthcare! #SavetheACA
Why didn't you vote on the Klobuchar/Sanders amendment on 1/11/17? You talk about saving lives, where's your action?
She was having a pacemaker implanted at the time
WHY WHY did Feinstein vote AGAINST lowering pharm drug costs w/ Canadian Bill brought by Sanders???? Constituents WANT 2KNOW!
She didn't vote against the Bill, she couldn't vote because she was having pacemaker surgery that day
wow.  The Young Turks are saying she voted against it as well as Corey Booker
Didn't seen  @TheYoungTurks report this (and saw their bit on Booker) although if they did hope they correct this
thank you for fighting!  SAVE ACA!!
Where were you last night when they voted?
I wish you speedy recovery.Thank you for your hard work and resolute stand in putting country above party & people above corp.
The working class pays for it. Our combined income <$100K our insurance premium $1.5K mo, Our deductable $6.6 K  "SilverPlan"
Does this woman work? Is,she poverty stricken? Stop calling it ACA.Who is it affordable for?
@Womensuperpower but but but "I don't want the ACA repealed just Obamacare.  I'm covered under ACA, I just can't afford Obama"
it's happening sweetheart perhaps you and your friends could pay those deductibles but most of us can't.
Guess what. You were paying them in your local taxes to cover the uninsured going to the CO hospitals.
Russian Egg Trumpbot.
Is the plan to have the people who cost the most, just die off and save money.  LIFE FIRST!
demon-crats like you have abused it by pulling crap like this: sex change operations for jailed felons at taxpayer expense?
She didn't Booker did. Feinstein was in hospital having pacemaker surgery when the vote was on
Can you tell us why Republicans think ACA isn't solvent?
That's my senator!
What can we do when Republicans control the House, Senate, White House and soon the Supreme Court? Please tell us what to do.
Yet, @SenFeinstein, you didn't filibuster this.
Millions of Americans were lied to and dumped off their preferred plans and forced to buy more expensive plans. Screw you.
Surgical procedure and back to work next day!  You are amazing.  Thank you for watching over California.
Senator, you are assuming your GOP colleagues have a conscience. What is apparent is they care only of themselves. Unfortunate
I can no longer afford my healthcare #RepealACA
have Emergency surgery, a car crash, see ofnyou can afford the hospital Bill without insurance.
can you afford half your salary for Obamacare - get a clue -  had great insurance prior to ACA - want my old plan

People's lives literally hang in the balance. But please don't push too hard post surgery - we need you in coming days!
Thanks for standing up for us and what is right!
proud to have a unstoppable women as my senator! Thanks for fighting to save the #ACA. My family depends on it!
They say you even didn't vote today to save ACA ......
she was getting a pacemaker.  It was votearama. Some kind of strange ritual. She went back to work the next day. @SenFeinstein
hope you are recovering well.
@dem2119 is the intent of @SenateGOP to start a new civil war? Asking for the MAJORITY of  that will not accept this #RIPUSA
our premiums have tripled.
. Please #SaveACA
@realDonaldTrump leave our healthcare alone!!!
why didn't you vote!?
Please save it
I had insurance thru the ACA.  Affordable premiums and great insurance coverage. #SaveACA
while I don't agree with your politics I wanted to wish you a speedy smooth recovery from your surgery. #GetWellSoon
Like cockroaches they come out at night.  What are you, ma'am, doing to stop them??? Please do SOMETHING!!!!
TEApubliCONS have ZERO conscience. ALL that matters to them are wealthy investors. Working class are simply useful schmucks.
but it was ok to force everyone to buy insurance. Take their freedom of choice away. Then lied to everyone about what it was.
Thank you for fighting to keep the ACA!
Obamacare helped some at the cost of others. This is a win/lose solution. We need a win/win solution. Be a help not hindrance
millions of Americans have been hammered by prem/deduct increases. It would be unconscionable to take that from health ins cos
Oh my God..I've had breast cancer..I could not have survived w/o health insurance..how can they do this..so shameful
and remember this: "#Obamacare, because Grandma is #ShovelReady
I don't believe that insurance will be illegal for the people after we get rescued from Obamacare. Can't they still buy some?
Canadian drugs are cheaper because Canada nego. prices & big pharma doesn't write Canadian laws or buy off their politicians.
Many of us could NOT afford #ACA. We expect the democrats to work with Pres. elect & VP elect to fix it, not obstruct @1jdadam
There are NO Democrats.  We must have single payer Medicare for all.  Their half measures were half-assed!
I understand you didn't even vote against repeal. (Nor FOR repeal; you didn't vote). Am I wrong? Pls explain. Thnx.
she was getting a pacemaker installled.
Oh wow, really?  Well, OK. Excused. Thnx.
I am one of the 65,844,954 brilliant Americans that voted against Trump. @realDonaldTrump
.@SenFeinstein MY In-Law perished bc of #ObamaCare bc he was pushed out too soon so HHHosp could reap Medicare bonus created by the ACA.
oh and the Insurance company wouldnt
Get Better. ..We Need You
@MarcVegan glad you're doing ok Mrs Feinstein
impeach trump #lockhimup
, not in this lifetime.
People keep in mind before ACA, lifetime caps meant if you needed a week in the ICU you met it.
We have many more stories from people who need the #ACA to survive. http://facesoftheaca.com/stories   Please come see who we are.
Says the woman who has never and will never use Obamacare
Its called selflessness. Something u Cons detest.
Exempting themselves from onerous burdensome legislation while forcing it upon the people is not selfless, sir.
#Republicans are going to try. Are you going to #fight for #ACA?  #California needs it! #Fight for #us or #Retire #Bakecookies
Thank you, Senator.  My 19 yo son has pre - existing heart condition.  Repeal would effect him all his life.
We really need single payer...I'm hoping after Trump...
on the back of a million other Americans. You didn't even read the bill!
#DeathByGOP to give tax breaks to millionaires
