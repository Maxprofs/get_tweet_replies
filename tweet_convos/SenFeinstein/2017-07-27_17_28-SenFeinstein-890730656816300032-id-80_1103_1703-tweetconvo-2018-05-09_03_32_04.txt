The Republicans are liars. It's getting pretty old.
Yeah, they are lying to themselves too.
No. The GOP is full of racists who hate Obama and want to destroy Obamacare. Period.
more &more lies after lies after lies. How can these people go to bed at night w/a clear conscience?Of course evil doesn't have a conscience
The projected rate drops are gonna save me about $5,000.00 a year!So your saying now I'm only gonna save $4,000.00 a year.I'm good with that
Nothing they do makes any sense...
Since when do u give a crap about premiums?
They don't care really. It's all about getting the tax breaks and shifting billions to the wealthy
DT said he loves uneducated people...must be because they're so easy to bait with lies, propaganda, and "conservative" agendas
Thank you for proving that America shines brightly! And so do you!
20% the 1st year, 20% the 2nd year, and 20% the 3rd year for a total 60% in the first three years!
The house divided by itself can not stand. Thank you Democrats for your solidarity against Republicans powerful force. McCain thank you!
It was you and all your Democratic colleagues that voted this monstrosity into law and ruin the Health Care system!  Put up or shut up!
according to the ever correct CBO
Vote NO
Heard that the House invoked "Martial law" & R trying 2 pull a fast 1 on us. Hope @SenateDems & @HouseDemocrats do what they can 2 stop it.
Thank you Senator Feinstein. Proud of your efforts!
We will not rest on our laurels.
Think about it•How would they know•You can't throw shit against a fan every week and think you have an answer GOP don't care
Just like we saw obamacare premiums drop too....oh no that was in our dreams, for some, they rose by 300%. Must try harder.
How do they expect to get away with stuff like this?
Thank you for voting to save lives!
Thank you for supporting us
Damn them all to hell! I don't know how u haven't killed one of them yet having to work with them!
They think everyone, may be half, is stupid to fall for it.
Obamacare increased premiums are already a burden. I don't see you helping contribute to fixing it, you obstructionist.
Until the market stabilizes*
Hint hint, when you destroy insurance providers and only 3 remain, they can charge exorbitant prices until there's computing which lowers $
Like 32 million were going to lose healthcare and die? Did you ever hear the story of the Boy who cried Wolf ?
The GOP lies.
Well that's an improvement over how much Obamacare has gone up or last 7 years.
ACA premiums have increased how much already?  With the expectation to go higher and with fewer choices. ACA is not affordable either.
maybe someone needs to do the math for them and show them the error of their ways. This leg will put us into a recession.
And Obamacare doubled my premiums.  You  got us into this mess without working with republicans in 2010.
Republicans LIE
Obamacare premiums increased some places over 140%!
You passed a P.O.S., inflicted your Total Gov. control, would one of your Judges inflict pain on my family, I would Retaliate, Severly.
I see an @FBI probe in your future with you and your husbands shady government real estate deals.
What is currently going on?
The best thing to come your way would be for health insurers to deny every claim filed by all Congress members and their staffers!
Counting on you to vote no on these bills I can't afford to pay for high Heath care
Thanks for updates Senator.  You are appreciated!!! Go Dianne Go. Keep the tweets coming.
GOD HELP US!-A TRAITOROUS  MADMAN HAS OUR COUNTRY ON IT'S KNEES.WHILE THE GOP IS ON A MISSION TO DESTROY US.
SENATOR THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE REASONING TO REMOVING ACA! IF THAT'S THE CASE ;KEEP ACA ;AS IS!
Vote no
hay genius, what do you think Obama care did? mine went up 122%
Have you ever had one good damn thing to say be ready for carms
But everyone will cheer because Obama out of the name and elevated premiums are better for it
I hope the Senate investigates the threats against Alaska, Hawaii and their senators. Absolutely unacceptable.
You lied to get O'Care. #SkinnyRepeal empowers me to make MY choice on whether to insure MY body. Not government. Vote #freedom and #liberty
It empowers you to watch the country's healthcare system collapse
Are they still exempting members of Congress from the plans? #GOPhurtsAmericans
was the CBO correct when they scored Obamacare? No...No...hell no. Obama swore the premiums would go down...he lied
Your plan increased mine
Mi e went up twofold since Obamacare.
Why are your colleagues doing this?
Americans are aghast at this disfunction.
Glad my 2 Senators are helping us Californians.
I wish you Californians will hurry up and secede you're a burden on the rest of the Union!
Take a stance on single payer or take a hike (both are not mutually exclusive). Choose wisely.
what plan, there aint no plan...and guess what we are stuck with?
Give em hell, Senator.
I'm still waiting for my $2400 savings Obamacare promised.
Did u actually believe anything that silver tongued BS artist said? After his re-election any pretense of being out 4 US was out the window
And the CBo was so correct about Obamacare? 24mill,2 receive coverage?! Joke! Less than 5mill r covered. @POTUS @Pogot more votes rhan u
All of Republicans bills are Camels: horses designed by committee. #SkinnyRepeal #NoMoreCamels
Mistake:  They meant they want lower premiums for themselves!
math is not their strength that is for sure......
Your gangs plan has spiking health insurance costs
Once again their words do not match their actions.
They are planning the vote for 2 am tonight....stay woke @SenateDems
Healthcare policy is a tough issue.  I hope you guy (and girls) get it right, for the sake of the patients' outcomes.  Good luck.
Republicans do NOT know how to tell the truth.  They will say whatever is necessary to get their way, even if it means selling their soul.
Oh really?
You have no credibility
