Chuck Grassley saw the info you saw, and he tweeted "no evidence of Russian collusion". Quit wasting tax $ on fool's errands.
No thank you, I'm good!
Comey had ties to the Clinton Foundation, didn't you know he would cover her butt??
are you concerned about Goudy and Nunes trying to make this an investigation about the leaks? They aren't doing their jobs!
So are you also going to call for a special prosecutor to look into your tax evasion and hw you support the murder of children
Only one crime to date - the leak of Gen. Flynn. Are you calling for investigation & prosecution of the leaker?
# hearing as per Comey he said Russia hacked both REP and DEM during election but only leaked DEM. Why 
# independent committee, needed!
@dbindsch Please call for suspension of Gorsuch hearings until IC findings are completed!
thank you for continuing to pursue requirement for investigation to determine the breadth and depth of Russian manipulation
Your digging for any information.  You are out of line.
I am a constituent Thank you #IndependentInvestigation
i really feel that all confirmation hearings should be delayed until investigations of Russia/Trump admin ties are  completed
Read and am always calling your office to thank you, for making us proud
Thank you, Senator. Why is your counterpart Grassley now tweeting information about the classified briefing you had last week?
Please demand an Independent Commission to investigate. If the #ComeyHearing is any indication the @GOP aren't up for the job.
He is hiding information to protect Obama
Your manboy got caught. Trying to blame everyone else but him won't change the facts. U backed a con man.
go trump
While at it release the intel leaker!  That should be the TOP PRIORITY.
why did Grassley tweet that based on mtg w/ Comey there is no connection Trump/ Russia?  WTH?
independent investigation is the only acceptable answer
please postpone irreversible appointments (i.e. SCOTUS) until Trump/Russia election collusion situation is clear #trumprussia
I Agree with you!
todays hearing proved GOP will not cooperate. we need independent comm to invest & promptly as we  have traitors in the WH
no thanks.
yes we need independent investigation. GOP think they are at completely different hearing. Thank you for your service!
Please block Gorsuch until investigation is completed.
today's testimony justifies need for an independent investigation of trump/Russia. We the people demand it!
@ManMet80  Thank you Ma'am!!!!  God bless you!
Americans don't know who to trust. #IndependentInvestigation needed. This is HUGE.
I think we need to find out how deep we are in this mess.Thank Senator Feinstein.
@TallyAnnaE make it happen Senator don't let democracy die
thank you
TY. You are the only politician I truly trust. Thank you for yor dedication to truth & justice & making the people of CA #1.
we agree with you DiFei!
I believe @TGowdySC asked the more relevant questions. He wanted to know from where the leaks emanated. That's the real story.
Comey hides info
Hillary knew about the wiretapping 
She needs to be in jail
Podesta group Hillary Campaign manager got money from Russia
U need to be in a home.
Comey incompetent he needs to go
He refuses to answer another Loretta Lynch
treason is the reason for this spring season.

#Russia
Senator Feinstein, please tell us, your constituents, that you will FILIBUSTER Gorsuch. #92262
You mean the same Comey that fip flopped twice on Hillary, listed her many felonies, and then declined to prosecute?
the pace is glacial. The results are essential. Press on at a faster clip.
Your years of stinking up the Senate.and embarrassing Californians has run it's course. You epitomize the need for term limits
Sen. Feinstein needs an FBI investigation into her steering of Green Energy Contracts to family members and other villains.
Investigate all you want, but please stop saber rattling with Russia.
Thank you
I couldn't agree more. Nadia, California
Good but better would have been calling for an Independent investigation #Trumprussia  #russiagate
Comey is inconsistent and is hiding an agenda, he really should be replaced.
.@SenFeinstein the Gorsuch hearing must be delayed until Trump/Russia investigation is complete. And we need an impartial special prosecutor
You folks need to crank it up a notch and shut down the gov't until Trump is totally exposed for what he is - Super-traitor
Why? You're in a bubble of ignorance.
thank you for your statement. Yes, agree, we must have independent outside investigation and get the bottom of this!
Gorsuch vote must be delayed until investigation is complete. No pres under such suspicion should make lifetime appointment.
totally agree, but what is the recourse if stonewalling Republicans don't allow?
Thank you, Senator. You are shining like a diamond right now.
Comey & the FBI agents who tilted the election should be fired!
Thank you Senator Feinstein. We want your voice to be strong and persistent. #Trumprussia #TREASON #ComeyHearing
THIS IS ABOUT CRIME. Imagine Nixon tweeting: "The real story of Watergate is DeepThroat's leaks. WashingtonPost is FAKE NEWS!"
how about independent investigations.
Thanks @SenFeinstein! Are standing committee investigations enough, or do we need a bipartisan select committee?
We MUST DEMAND an Independent Commission to Investigate #TrumpRussia Collusion! @GOP are PROVING useless! #ComeyHearing

Now!!
Nicely done.
Go piss up a Russian rope.
