Can we just let California secede from the USA already... #CalExit
Women's rights do not include the right to kill police officers. You shame decent women across the U.S. Know this, you do not speak for me.
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenKristenGillibrand  told women 2 attend
women's march 4woman cop killer. Speaker there
Tortured man 2death
@SenKamalaHarris #AllLivesMatter #BlueLivesMatter #AmericaMatters Liberals and Democrats are against all of these! #MAGA
Find a women's march and support Terrorism, Cop Killers and Anti-Americanism... Feinstein approved! #LiberalIdeology
And all of them are supporting sharia and the victimization of women
Pro choice for fathers rights to keep the unborn babys life
Thank you for all your years of caring and working on women's issues. You help make CA such a GREAT state.
Ignoring the dead bodies the marchers walk over?
If @SenKamalaHarris could pull the trigger herself on a COP and get away with it she would. No surprise these Liberal idiots support terror.

Are you letting these other sisters in? Or this is another "political" move....
just more proof that that the DNC is the party of Radical Iislamic Muslim Terrorist !
democrats support cop killers.
Bunch of nasty women who want to be victims (just pick a category, any category) and practice hating (President, unborn babies, law & order)
if these women supported Jared Loughner would you still support them?  Is a policemans life worth less than a congresswomans?
wheres your pink pussycat hat Senator? You should have that much considerstion for imploding obummer care
These women are Marxists who admire a cop-killer Marxist. Shame on you for supporting this!
Can't wait to see you support ugly, violent women marching.  Get out there 84 year old!
Condemn or naw?

.@SenFeinstein Take today's energy with you into the Senate! Along with Sen. @KamalaHarris you'll kick some ass! #WomensMarch
we walked today for human rights. So proud to stand with like minded people. America is already great,proof today!
What about the "human rights" of the cop killed?
What about the rights of the man your speaker
Kidnapped Tortured & Killed in cold bld?
hope to see you participating for your fellow sisters!
two thousand plus in Redondo Beach
We are counting on you to insure that our voices are heard & our concerns are addressed in the Senate - & the White House
marching for abortions, what a horrible aspiration! Sick liberals buy hair weaves and fake nails instead of birth control
Pro-choice....not Pro-abortion.  Some women support pro-choice but would never have an abortion.
What about the potential fathers rights? Seems like they are being forgotten in this arguement of pro choice.
thanks for being a great big sister
I am a woman who voted for Trump
snail trails of selfishness all over the state
hello from the Riverside, CA march!
-- California is a mess -- the "sisters" would be better served volunteering in their neighborhoods 4 standards & values
what the hell are you doing?
Sad really.  She obviously does not understand what the #womensmarch is for
People having trouble posting (facebook) or tweeting march routes. Both services changing settings on those critical of Trump
Why?
Perhaps praying in multi denominational sevice with new POTUS is beyond some's range of motion for peace, guidance and unity.
Bill rapes em and Hillary drags em through the mud
Blame Clintons again.  You already "won" the election, right?  Embrace it because it's all on you.
that's right trump won and will even make life better for you
