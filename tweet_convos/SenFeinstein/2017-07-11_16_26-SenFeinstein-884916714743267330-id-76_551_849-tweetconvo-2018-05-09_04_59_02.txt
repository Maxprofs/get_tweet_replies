It can't be sustained. What part do you not understand.
ACA & Medicaid are entirely sustainable. Politicians who say otherwise are lying to you.  Do not fall for the con: https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/882606719427387393 … .
VERIFIED: Trump/Price HHS report admits ACA markets are stable—the risk pool is not worsening as claimed.

Thank you. Of course they are. How come other countries have good, humane healthcare and America, the great does not?
I worked overseas the the last 10 years and they hate there healthcare...why do rich from all over the world came to US for treatment?
Universal healthcare is extremely popular in many countries.  Stop perpetuating blatant nonsense.
And "the US has excellent healthcare for rich people, but not for everyone in the country" is a problem.  Universal healthcare would fix it.
It would just destroy our good care. Do you want to wait a month to see a doctor? That happens all over Europe...
What poppycock!  Unreliable beyond 1-2 cycles; reduced rate of growth only; $34M per state per year
Why do the republicans, who desperately want to run America, hate Americans?
Why do they keep winning elections?  They are disgusting people.
Because of gerrymandering of House districts & voter suppression promoted by GOP state legislators.  Hold your state government accountable.
GOP wants to eliminate M'caid first, then M'Care. So much money to give to the wealthy! Ryan's dream
This insane Repub. Unhealthy careless bill is irresponsible, inhumane,  no other country would even think of it.
Horrible!
Sen. Feinstein, how can they look a child with Type 1 diabetes or autism in the eye with this cruel bill?
Getting government out of healthcare is well worth it!
#TrumpRussia before #AHCA . #TrumpRussiaFirst
@SenKamalaHarris Please keep opposing the Senate bill. Signed, a constituent.
What's indefensible is to continue spending like the bill is never gonna come due! #20trilliondebt #tlot #ccot #millennial #tcot
They need to pay for the Faux Wall somehow.
@wjcoop Doesn't cut Medicaid. Slows the rate of GROWTH. Quit lying to America!!!! 
That's crazy!! How many people are going to be left with no meds & treatment that many of them really need, to live!!
I retweeted this to Republican senators. Thank you.
GREAT ! It's a big money scam forced upon working Americans and just another government handouts for votes. Time to stop the SCAM !
Read the bill, it cuts growth...hack.
Ooooohhh
It would kill all that truly rely on the coverage, not ok.
We all know TRUMPCARE is terrible. McConnell is a sellout McConnell and Ryan. Bought and paid for by Trump. Cabinet position for wife.
No GOP legislation until Trump is impeached and found innocent or removed. None
Maybe you forgot that we are 20 trillion in debt thanks to the democrats and now we must live with in our means.
Yes! We need more Medicaid, not less! #WorkTogether, @SenateDems & @SenateGOP! 
#MakeAmericaUnitedAgain
#MedicareForAll 
#SinglePayer
Can you imagine what 3.4 Trillion dollars looks like? Way to much money spent on a bad government program full of corruption
I tried calling your office- phone line busy, so tweeting to THANK YOU for speaking out about all these issues! From SoCal 
Is it defensible to be $20T in debt & want to spend more or to make the govt bigger & more powerful instead of just protecting liberty?
Go getum Senator!!!
Cuts future growth.. what  lying scum bags politicians are..
I think that is horrible!!
I still don't know how someone's reproductive system can simultaneously be 0% not my business and 100% my financial responsibility.
Congress should have the same healthcare as the people they represent!
Holy Moley!
You need a new job and you should quite you are not helping
that's greed to an unholy extent
No bloody way we can let this happen!!
Disgusting people who put billionaires above hard working Americans.
Also indefensible to sell out to big pharma donors and not support single payer
it controls rate of increase....stop the lies sen feinstein...medicaid and medicare need reform with per capita block grants funding,
The CBO is a government think tank that can't do accounting properly .
It will also practically eliminate the tsumami warning system.   Like everything else about Trump most people won't see it coming.
Wow. That sounds like a problem. So why are we bringing refugees that don't share our values to this country? Why ask for more problem?

So maybe think about filibuster by amendment?
Unless you're a zillionaire getting that in the form of a tax cut from your lackey in the @GOP
Good!  Medicaid was massively expanded under Obamacare & cannot be sustained, but U know that already, you hack! Repeal & replace Obamacare
This is why we #RiseUp4HealthCare. For people w/disabilities who rely on Medicaid to live at home & work in the community. 1/
For autistic kids & adults who need treatment & supports that Medicaid provides. 2/
For seniors in nursing homes whose care is funded by Medicaid. 3/
For the homeless. 4/
For Veterans. 5/
For all of us. #RiseUp4HealthCare  6/6
There is that much $$ in waste & abuse in ANY gov run program. Cuts will make them more efficient.
Shameful
WHY? Where you gonna get the money to keep funding everyone. When is enough, enough?
They really hate people, don't they...
That's a better bill?
We must all stay focused no matter how much we want to talk, tweet and watch Don Jr.
.@SenFeinstein @CenterOnBudget Is it just life for the rich?  What about others, not so fortunate?  How many $or possessions needed to live?
You are being primaried by @David4SenateCA . we are not with you anymore.  Your greed will end you. #TimeToFly
You Dianne are broke
that is criminal and heartless.
.@SenFeinstein @CenterOnBudget Begs the question, why are we on this earth? On a temporary basis.  What do we owe our fellow sojourners?
The @GOP hates the poor, elderly, sick, and kids. But they LOVE Russia and billionaires!
Please fight this very mean attack on those that need it most!
You will have to now pay taxes
Republicans are indefensible
Holly shit
