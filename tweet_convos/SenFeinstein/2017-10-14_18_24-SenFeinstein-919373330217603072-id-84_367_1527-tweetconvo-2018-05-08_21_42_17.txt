HOW ?????????????/

is this the old carp ? ''  cant put genie bac in lamp''  use last wish, tell genie to go back in lamp.  FEINSTEIN'S  job that simple, DO IT
I agree, they will recover.... I am more. concerned about your Alzeimer moment of not knowing the name for the other house of Congress.
This is the first public appearance you’ve made in the state in how long?
That's not true
Epitome of #Hypocrisy! Where's the pro-active legislation, like... hmm... like IRRIGATION?!? How many years more?
Today I visited some of the communities devastated by wildfire. The stories are heartbreaking, but we stand with you. We WILL recover. 
How many years do you get to be a Senator, do absolutely nothing, then spew out platitudes in response to a preventable situation... Errrgh!
Bye bye idiot
At least you showed up. Trump is golfing!
Do you know the fires started at night when there were 40 - 70 mph winds?
These wildfires are a frightening occurrence in CA when we get the fall winds.  Thanks Sen. Feinstein for being with us.
REACTIVE as usualEver hear the word "Proactive",Diane?It has to do with common sense prevention.And smart, selfless decision making

Worse US poverty rate at 20%, Hepatitis A epidemic, insolvent CA gov, hollywood decadence going main stream. Havent DEMs done enough for CA?
So sorry for this happening. We fly over never blamed Clinton vote for disaster.
What next? Legislation to ban extreme heat? How can we as Americans tolerate this heat wave? (Sarcasm intended)
Thank you Ma'am.  Please continue.....
We know. We know... you’re running for re-election. Great photo ops!
And what r u doing?

YOU WONT RECOVER IF YOU KEEP BEING CHILDISH,RESISTING,1/2TRUTHS,WHINNING..MAKE IT WORK GET TO WRK NO FIGHTING YOUR A DIPLOMAT GETITDONEORGO
@ThomasJ17762016 I am from Houston, not California. Just want you to know that I envy the representation Californians have!
84 years young, the power of the Dark Side
Has anyone mentioned to @realDonaldTrump that our state is on fire? He hasn't mentioned it once. #MAGAmyass
Impeach #MoronDon
WHERE IS CA MONEY @TheDemocrats Get Heinsteins dirty money CA will not uphold federal law and should NOT BE GIVEN FURTHER $$ until they do
WHERE IS CA MONEY @SpeakerRyan  HIRE Lawyers to break fed laws & to give to illegals & supports sanctuary,UNTIL they pull that $, NO MORE $
WHERE IS CA MONEY @POTUS  HIRE Lawyers to break federal laws & to give to illegals and supports sanctuary, UNTIL they pull that $, NO MORE $
There is so much blood on these officials in CA. WHY THE HELL IS THE UNDERBRUSH NOT CLEANED UP as in other states. WHY do u think bad fires?
NO THANKS TO YOU. Heart go to people in CA but how DARE she ask for added fed help when REFUSE to uphold laws of our country. TRY LEAVE USA?
Thank you.
@SenFeinstein here’s a clever idea, shutdown stupid #Russia / #Trump witch hunt & spend the money on #wildfire & #hurricane victims duh !!
How are you gonna recover didn't your governor spend all your money on illegal immigrants??? What's next federal aid? Sanctuary cities??
You sound more presidential each day

Thank you @SenFeinstein
No, you are going to get worse and worse because the democratic party has reached out to nazis
How many people yelled for you to retire because you won't support #MedicareForAll #SB562? I'll bet it was a lot.
U have my vote.
Dang lady! You look like you should be giving out samples of cheez whiz at the Costco.

Hang it up already.

#Retire
By denying them health care? By shipping their tax dollars overseas to fund imperial wars? By wiretapping their electronic devices? #Phony
You’re spending our tax dollars to view something you can see on FOX news for free.
Retire.
But what about gun control
It’s been devastating. There are still people missing but we must stand as Californians.  Make it through the worse and quell the fire.
And then we mourn our losses and help the survivors
We?  You have a Rat in your pocket?  You’re rich write them a check. They don’t need u standing with the. Build them a house
How can other Californians help? Donate?
So why don’t you & the Neoliberal Dems support #MedicareForAll???
#MedicareForAll would cut out the insurance industry and reduce cost of everything by 20%-30%. They donate to @DNC. Shills won't have it.
Is she the one in Congress having meds delivered to her? You know, the alseimers drugs the pharmacist told us about?
What’s the best way to help? Please let us know.
Donations are best. Redwood Credit Union has set up a foundation 2 accept donations. 100% goes to victims. I live here, it is a nightmare.
@SenFeinstein is now a @POTUS supporter!!!
She quoted #POTUSTrump 
"We stand with you"
Welcome to the light side , Dianna Feinstein!!!
Can you talk to DarthPelosi and tell her to leave the dark side!!!???
@NancyPelosi
Leadership!! You are awesome! Need you more than ever!!!!
You have become a very lost and BIG MOUTH CONGRESS 
YOU NEED TO STEP DOWN
OR BE IMPEACHED
those poor people. exhausted. their faces full of despair. good you were there.
Some reading material. https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984/Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.pdf …
Thank you Senator Feinstein you always show you care about Californians!
God Bless You
A true example of why we need STRONG women in National Leadership positions... I hope they save the " mold " of this gem!

Daniel T.
Caught somebody tweeting off to the side.
"We stand with you" = I'm going back to my mansion.... #ima1%politician
I can support you on this one.
So so sad.
@SecretaryZinke is a real #HatchAct so not #Loyal #AmericanPeople
How do wildfires burn trees from the inside out?
Damn you just rushed down there. Dumped on trump for slow appearance in PR. Go away
Still haven't heard anything about your personal donation to any victims of any of these natural disasters Feinstein what's up with that?
Any word on foul play? I've heard of people experiencing unexplained electrical phenomena in the area before the fires.
Yes
It all depends on what "we" means.   
Swamp Witch #2 speaks with forked tongue.
Thank you, Senator.
We appreciate your work on our behalf.
She’s doing it for votes, not to help.
How about comprehensive reform of Logging so we do not have these kind of fires
