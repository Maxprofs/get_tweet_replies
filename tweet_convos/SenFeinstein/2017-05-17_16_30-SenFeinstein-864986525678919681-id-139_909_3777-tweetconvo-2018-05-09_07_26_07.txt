@SenFeinstein you know @ChuckGrassley is complicit and trying to stall everything. Time to step up b4 Trump establishes martial law.
Good. It's about time #impeachTrumpnow  got some 
Thank you. We appreciate your tireless work.
I'll bet he's terrified he's just going to be another victim of serial Killery! She has a huge body count tied to her!

Tonight's #QuoteOfTheDay by John F. Kennedy! #Dobbs 
Can't wait!!! #ImpeachTrump

How David Clarke Bridges Donald Trump’s Gun Nuts and Vladimir Putin’s Kleptocrats http://thebea.st/2gabQXL 
Thank you for your service.  Proud of all the times I've voted for you.
Can Comey be a subpoena? Americans deserve the truth.

Thank you!
Thank you!
U said RE Trump invstgtion:  "There are RUMORS and NEWSPAPER stories around but that is NOT NECESSARILY EVIDENCE". Seriously? Explains a LOT
He wont do it.
Thank you so much
If Trump should think about his words, so should Comey, "disgusting" to describe a handshake with Prez 2 days into his term?
Excellent! Depending on how many times he says "I can't answer that here, it's classifiid" will u then have closed hearing to get answers?
Hope he accepts; he's a man of great integrity, who fumbled a bit in 2016
Thank you. Like the rest of the nation, I am exhausted just watching @POTUS   drag us into chaos, embarrassment, and democratic destruction.
TRUMP NEEDS TO NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY UNTIL THIS INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED!!!
I FEAR!!!! HE'LL SEEK HOSTAGE LIKE ASANGE????!!!
Thank you. There are some who think you are not doing enough but they don't understand your methods
Go, Dianne!
Am anxious to hear what he has to say
Why would negative reception help our president, liberals are not positive, listen to yourselves.
Thank you!
Excellent.  For that, we thank you.
All u democrats can go to h---. You all make me sick.
Thank You Senator This is a Treasonous and Seditious Series of Acts that must be Investigated!

Wow.Tweeting at Sheriff Clarke? He was in Russia in 2015 same time as Flynn/Stein dinner with Putin 
He IS not the FBI Director, he WAS, get your facts straight.  That job title has been taken from him.
Chuck Grassley has 0 credibility. An extreme right wing partisan. Over 80 and re-elected to a 7th six year term.
As soon as AF 1 is 6 hours out, begin the hearing.
Dems want 2know why YOU R coming down hard on Comey 4 not testifying to SJC.  Clearly Comey is concerned abt ppl on that committee!
He will run all over her the sheriff that is... LOL
Well done Senator!
Do not let the Republicans politicize these hearings! I.e., @Jim_Jordan
Please keep the meeting with Comey open to the public
BRAVO'S BRAVO'S BRAVO'S
#NewElection this has gone on way too long. ALL OF THEM OUT!
Get him to admit he's lying like the narcissistic person he is.  You are right up there with him!
Thank you 4 cont. to push 4 a special prosecutor. UR actions have helped restore faith of the People and shown we are a Country of Laws
Thank you senator!
Bless you!
What country do you think this is?
IN PUBLIC!
Please do it in OPEN Session. Thank you for your leadership!
Forget impeachment. Trump should be forced to resign. Mentally unfit for office.
Public or closed?
Thank you!
Thank you @SenFeinstein for not letting up on this investigation. You are one tough lady!
Sen Feinstein...keep kicking ass, please.
This is like you, old news.
In Public?
There's a lot of important issues that need your / our attention; i. e. #MedicareForAll, $15.00 minimum wage are two.
In public testimony one hopes
Not only you guys have invited him, but don't expect him to freely come, he dug a hole for himself..bad judgement!!
Invited? Why not subpoena?
Grassley will only ask about leaks. #sad
Yes! Thank you!
Please get to the bottom of RussiaGate!!
@Eykis Yes!
Thank you
The American People hope this is all done in public
Former FBI Director Comey's "PUBLIC HEARING" will get HIGHER RATINGS than trump's inauguration or tacky tv show! #TheResistance
Thank you, Senator. Hope it will happen soon and be public.
Why didn't you invite him when Obama asked him to drop investigation on Clinton. Such shameful hypocrites
Good
Thank you for your hard work to preserve our democracy.
@journalschism publicly?
Great! Sounds like we are getting somewhere now. Nice work!
That's good but you do know that Grassley is part of the whole Russia thing, right?
Public, please. 

And nobody trusts Grassley.
Thank You @SenFeinstein  @SenSanders  @SenJohnMcCain  @StevieVanZandt  @benchten @billmaher  @JimLaddRocks @JohnFugelsang  @IndivisibleTeam
#Resistance
#resist
I'm a wonder at members of congress who don't know what's in the constitution they swore to protect.
Any chance Grassley will stay on topic and not try to defame Comey by claiming he leaked or something even worse?

Public testimony please.
Thank you!!
Thank you, Senator - from a constituent.
Good for u. Does this mean that the IA Senator realizes that this is above party, that American citizens/taxpayers demand a thorough investg
took his merry time
Maybe next you should ask @GOPLeader and @SpeakerRyan to testify. Seems they know something about @realDonaldTrump being on Putin's payroll.

Better be public or it's useless.
Good. Please keep an eye on Grassley. :0)
You are a Obstructionist / Democrat you hate Law and Order and the Constitution.
Very good, Honoranle Sen. Feinstein. I will look forward to your thoughts.
Thank you!
Any chance of inviting @JohnPodesta to talk about what he knows regarding the #SethRich murder?

@DNC #DNCFraudLawsuit @AP @CNN @MSNBC @ABC
Comey will bob & weave like a boxer. If anybody can give a "non-answer" it's Comey. Don't let him off the hook.
Open hearing . Enough hiding
Thank, God for you @SenFeinstein!!!!
I appreciate you commitment to get to the bottom of this. #FollowTheFacts #impeachtrump #resist

@PeterBeinart Fomer Director Comey
In public @SenFeinstein ?
Thank you. Plz make this is just & swift before he & his destroy anymore of our democracy and threaten our safety 

Thank you!
As others here have tweeted: We want Comey's PUBLIC testimony only!
Constituent here. Thank you; critical to ascertain truth.

Oh and senator, just one more thing. Love your suit.
Thanks, Lady. "I" is for impeachment.
I understand that he declined Senator
Thank you.
Thank you for your hard work!
With Mueller in place senate and house committees are gonna move to the back of the line. Should have played nice long ago.
Yes!  Sen.Dianne Feinstein ; The FAIR Judicial process.
Publicly, I hope!
Has Director Comey accepted?
Senator, can you please put a stop to Sheriff Clarke's acceptance to the Department of National Security?
Let @SenRonJohnson know your feelings about Sheriff Clarke. I tweeted him already. He is directly involved in decision or possible reversal
Done, thanks!
Public hearing?
Public hearing please!!!
I'm sure he's THRILLED for another opportunity to explain his reasoning.
Thank you Sen. Feinstein !!! Will it be on tv or private? @ChuckGrassley
Be careful with snake @ChuckGrassley
Liberals!!!!!
What's this? Courage? From YOU!? Whodathunkit! Now if you could only find the courage to stop Jeff Sessions's Reefer Madness crackdown.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @RepSwalwell
Thank you for your tireless work, Senator! Today is one for the history books! <3
TY TY TY !!  SHUT IT DOWN
I hope it's public.
Secretly or publicly?
Comey said it must be OPEN which is public. Smart move on his part.
Can't wait!
IMPEACH BOTH TRUMP AND COMEY!!!
Why don't you hold town hall meetings in California? #RESIGN #resignnow
Public or private testimony? Is there a date yet?
ah, a fellow predict it player
He said he'll only do a public testimony.
I think it would be amazing to hear what else he found before being fired by @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Wonderful!
