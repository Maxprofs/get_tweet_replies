No on Sessions!
elections have consequences and we won. "Barack Hussein Obama" Karma is a bitch huh? lmao Sit down
Who cares if you won? Get over it! We will obstruct, obstruct! Just like GOP!
I hope you really don't believe your little map scares California!
That's what happens in majority rule
Obstruct, Obstruct, Obstruct! Liarinchief! Toddlerinchief!
Please obstruct.  This is madness.
You mad? hahaha liberalism is why you lost this election and you will lose a lot more
Looser? Trump lost the popular vote by record amount, just barely squeaked win with help from Putin and other bad actors.
Do you think the message of Saturdays march, from millions of Democratic voters, was to approve these nominees?
Get your act together, vote a straight party line, and oppose Trump's nominees, Trump's policies, GOP attacks.
There is no more common ground. This is an existential battle. Be on the right side or move out of the way.
there are small kids in the room and you are allowing liberals to disrupt the hearings. You are a fkn joke.
@KamalaHarris THIS Californian says vote an automatic 'No!' on any nominees who hasn't passed ethics review
California is a communist state. I hope it falls in the ocean
Ha! Sorry, but we now have more Russians in govt than all of Calif
Ca is paying for sex changes for inmates that murdered a person. And you want us to take Ca seriously? Bunch of losers,
NO DeVoss. No on Price. Period!
NO!!! FIGHT!TY4ur outstanding service! http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-confirmation-231602 … #TheResistance #KKK #traitortrump #KGB #AltRight
STOP Greenlighting Trumps SWAMP nominees! Who do you represent? I live in the Bay Area. This is CRAPPY!
Shame on u for delaying approval of Sen Sessions. It's ether a political move or cause u r too old to keep up
You put this country through the wrath of Eric Holder and you won't confirm Jeff Sessions.  Hypocrite.
All you Dems are just being poor losers. President Trump called for Unity & you all are dividing us more.
Thx for blocking the vote on Sessions.  Now, stop him from being confirmed.
@POTUS # Senator Feinstein continues her obstructionist hypocritical non-productive liberal ways- disgraceful !
# THIS is exactly why we need TERM LIMITS!!!!!
You're postponing the vote & blaming it on the women's march that's already taken place?  DO YOUR JOB!
what you are afraid of is that AJ will do what Obama's AJs have been doing only doing it to you who deserve it
AJ? For "Attorney Jeneral"? @nolickspittles @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems
"AG" type not "AJ" thanks
say no to ALL nominees!  Resist!  The CA people want you to vote NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO and NO
Just heard you voted FOR Trump AG pick.  VERY disappointed in you.  Very.
Please #BLOCK unvetted cabinet nominees until conflicts are resolved - including background of bigotry
unvented? Are you serious!! After 8 years of no justice or leadership!?
vote against Sessions! His racist, sexist, ANTI-LGBTQ record is clear. We can do better! The world is watching!
lies lies lies

Support HR82! Many Americans have been hurt or killed by violent criminals who are not our citizens.
https://theintercept.com/2017/01/23/14-senate-democrats-fall-in-line-behind-trump-cia-pick-who-left-door-open-to-torture/ … WHY??? Why Senator? #TheResistance NOvote4 #traitortrump's choices! 1ofur #constituents
She should retire! Along w @SenatorLeahy who's been there 42yrs! U didn't HARASS @EricHolder like U R now!
when Trump gets rid of the illegal CA voters on rolls,you guys will never get reelected & you know it.scared??
stop stalling and vote!!
Keep playing politics with A.G. pick.  You'll lose even bigger in 2 yrs.  I can hardly wait for that!
Don't delay on attorney general nomination. You're just playing politics.
Stop playing politics with cabinet pics. STOP
you cannot allow this to happen. #NoEthicsNoHearing
Correct, Holder refused2prosecute Black Panthers outside voting station w/billyclubs >VoteObama
Why do you come on Democratic tweets?  Spread your hate?  You are deplorable.
STOP APPROVING CABINET NOMINEES!!! NO TO ALL! Stop playing nice w/ a dictator! You look like this-
thank you for taking the time to carefully weigh Sessions' AG nomination. Your voice is heard and needed.
Why yes on Pompeo? Please vote no on these nominees!
Dragging your feet in confirmations just make the Dem Party look petty and bitter. There are bigger fish to fry
.@SenFeinstein You got your way with Obama's picks. Only fair approve Sessions @realDonaldTrump Ashamed of U SenatorFeinstein @SenFeinstein
You MUST deny DeVos' confirmation. Public school will not survive her proposed ideology.
@realDonaldTrump WHY would a picture showing police as pigs in our capital building be allowed? Dems now fight?
@LOLGOP @JudiciaryDems DeVos should NOT be confirmed. No experience in pubic education at all. Just married $$
very few people have any race issues anymore. Only worries people have are terrorists. Time for Dems to be gone
Really? Are you a person of color?
Sessions's approval would be huge step to the demise of our democracy and our FREEDOMS. Dems MUST prevent it!
Lack of ethics clearance is a disgrace. AG nominee is a throwback to pre-civil rights era. Stand up, say No.
lies lies lies
You're fucking idiot. Those marching were acting like fools. #LiberalismIsADisease
Feinstein is the exact type of DC politician President Trump meant when he said: "Politicians prospered"
Why did you vote to confirm Pompeo who defends torture?
Time for you to retire. You shouldn't vote for any one of the travesties nominated.
U consistently vote with GOP on issues that people flood your emails and sign petition to vote against. Retire.
Must be you did not hear "Mad-dona" speak?
Sen. Feinstein, You mentioned "Principals", and "Values". You stated the women's march was peaceful.
Wouldn't it be nice if everyone would just remember we are not our parties we are a Constitiutional Republic
Thank you for this!
Nay on Sessions, please!!
You r stalling on this because a bunch of women made a mess of DC streets, desecrated DAR building? #disgrace
You can slow walk it if you want, but thanks to Harry Reid and the rest of you progressives he will be AG #MAGA
why'd you vote to confirm Pompeo?

what happened to this Dianne Feinstein?
dear senator my dad served as a fire fighter for san diego before he died.  How will u help us?
keep fighting the Sessions appointment! Thanks for all you do.
Waiting for @TheDemocrats to show me they are ready to FIGHT like a @JamesCarville. Show me! #TheResistance
Please do not confirm Trump's cabinet choices. Thank you!
I hear you are on the fence about Sessions and TIllerson. Why? And if this is true, SHAME ON YOU.
Looks like you lost votes for voting in Mike Pompeo
Stop wasting our Tax / Time. We pay you to work. Do the confirmation.
Vote yes for Mr. Jeff Sessions for AG tomorrow.  Do not delay, we Americans are sick of your stall tactics.
Do NOT delay the vote on the honorable Jeff Sessions for AG; we need him in place now after the awful L. Lynch.
#AmericaFirst #MakeAmericaGreatAgain movement it's rightly & just #StrengthThroughUnity USA #ProtecTrump
Why can I not ever reach u on the phone in DC or SF?? Maybe u need more phone support.
please vote no on Rex Tillerson today. Please vote no on recommending Jeff Sessions tomorrow. #tillerson #jeffsessions
NO hearings before ethics reviews are complete & all paperwork filed including COI info.

I got your number from @amjoyshow but you weren't accepting messages until office hours:-( re: Spicer #AlterativeFacts
. @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @KamalaHarris No to Sessions!!  We can't have someone who has shown to be bigoted as our AG.
