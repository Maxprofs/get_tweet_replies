thanks for trying to hold back  the trump/Bannon tide.
She is an obstructionist protecting her backside.  We want #Sessions!
I sure don't want sessions.
Trump is likely in his final year as Prez. No nominee in a President's final year, right?
#BlockGorsuch
Great your Boycott
just say no!
Constituent here. Glad you're heading our concerns & urge you to vote no on Devos. #SaveOurSchools
Jeff Sessions!!HE IS MY ATTORNEY GENERAL!!
Sen Feinstein is out of touch with what Americans want and expect of their leaders.
You have lost your strength, step aside and let someone with energy oppose ALL nominees not just a couple.
Thank you, Senator! Keep up the pressure! Give them hell.
I say vote YES or get out of the way!
you want a cookie for that?
thank you @SenFeinstein for standing up for the best interests of our country! @SenateDems
wrong.  We want Sessions.  Her vote means nothing. Just grandstanding.
-good job!  I agree with everything you said!

#NoSessions
#YesSessions!
Shut up. Just shut up. @senfeinstein @mitchellreports
Thank you for the No vote on Sessions, @SenFeinstein @mitchellreports @YouTube
thank you Senator! We need Dems with backbones.
Senator if you did your duty Garland would already be on the Bench. Get to WORK!
Please vote against Gorsuch. That seat should have been filled by President Obama.
lady your full of hot air!why don't you put a cork in it and retire?let the big boys that really care bout the country run it!
we've seen your voting record on the floor for confirmations NOT HAPPY You should be voting NO! #noreElection
@JudiciaryDems @mitchellreports @YouTube well you got trumped again.  You people need to wake up
great answer. every person deserves to be judged on their own merit.  No petty antics in Congress.


I commend your efforts.  Bannon huge national security risk please watch
THANK You for voting No on Sessions. I feel heard, and I appreciate your work.
It's not about the merits of Gorsuch. You bemoan how #MerrickGarland was mistreated, but let it stand? NO. #GarlandOrBust
CLOWN IN THE SENATE!!!!
Appreciate your Sessions no want you to hold firm to NO Devoss, NO Price, NO Gorsuch. I am CA Dem
.@SenFeinstein Thanks for listening to the tens of thousands of calls & asserting that process matters.
how about no hearings until Putin's involvement is investigated? First things first
.@SenFeinstein Tell @SenateMajLdr the next #POTUS should nominate a judge for #SCOTUS  #MerrickGarland is the true nominee.
@tammij20824 @mitchellreports thank you Ms Feinstein.
Thank you for standing up for democracy!! @SenFeinstein @mitchellreports

DIANNE we the dem people r very upset with @SenateDems weakness. U NEED TO OPPOSE EVERYTHING GOP
Please vote no on DeVos!!
Vote "NO" on DeVos.
I'm a constituent. No to DeVos as well, please.
Jeff Sessions will be our next U.S. Attorney General!!!! WE WON!!!! YOU LOST!!!
you're a racist who refuse to allow Haitians Refugees bc they're black but want the ME bc of their OIL
You were elected to serve -it shouldn't be a lifetime job to get rich. 2018 is coming.
thank you for FINALLY voting NO, but why did you vote yes for all trumps other picks? You work for us, and we say NO to all
Thank you! Now, please don't approve any of the others. It's time to resist, not join forces.
good speech by the way
Thank you Senator Feinstein!
Thank you for FINALLY standing up and voting no on something 
I think moving on will allow the Republicans to continue obstructing justice. We must stop the confirmation process. 90042
you are finally voting no on a Trump nominee!
Say #StolenSeat, please. We feel like you do not really represent the majority CA who voted against Trump.

@mitchellreports
found your interview very promising.  You stated things quite clearly and i hope things can move on
Glad you will oppose Sessions. Please support Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Thank u, @SenFeinstein for stong stand against all Trump's dangerous nominees : Sessions, #SCOTUS, Pruitt. @mitchellreports @YouTube
Yes! Thanks Senator.
Please vote NO on SCOTUS nominee!
U skewered @SenatorSessions Way to go senator, keep it up calling out incompetence, racism & sexism!
then ask her why she's refusing to take the Haitians Refugees bc they don't have oil & all black
I certainly hope you intend to vote NO or wherever else you can do to stop this.
Feel like this shouldn't have been that much of a question for you...
Too bad you didn't stand your ground on the cabinet appts. We're watching you.
.@SenFeinstein  interesting info from @seanmdav  I seem to remember guns and religion mentioned in Constitution ...not health care 
.@SenFeinstein @mitchellreports @YouTube It's about time that you actually did/said something about @realDonaldTrump. Stand up for America!
No on Gorsach too. The base is watching you all. We're in the streets and demanding you listen.
Yes, @SenFeinstein US has been w/o a SCOTUS for 10 months, bc deliberate GOP obstruction. What's 4 more years?  
@mitchellreports @YouTube
you voted YES to ALL 5 TRUMP nominees, care to comment?
will you be voting no on DeVos too? A " no" on DeVos protects the next generation too. -a constituent
Wrong. We want Sessions. You can't vote for your own position or that of others.  CA is ruined thanks to your ignoring us.
Obstruct. Defeat #vichyDemocrats. Never forget never forgive.
Yes I saw moment of your interview on @MSNBC ;  Sen. Dianne Feinstein
Voting Senate Flloor presently
Thank you for your "no" vote!
thank you for not voting for this SC nominee!
Thank you @SenFeinstein !  Now the same for SCOTUS! Things are moving fast! Stay diligent!
@mitchellreports @YouTube
You should be focused on #CongressionalTermLimits, #FlatTax and #SocializedMedicine!
vote no on Gorsuch.
Thank you! No on Devos also
@on MSNBC? Who watches Fake News?  You, and other divisive Politicians, are exactly why Trump won...
Thank you Senator Feinstein! Trump needs to be shown we won't tolerate his fascism!
