I think shutting her down was correct
Wrong Sessions was being debated as a nominee, not a senator. The rule didn't apply to him. #ShePersisted
he is still a senator and the unbecoming of a senator was on her
.@Jim49az @SenFeinstein @SenWarren But it was okay for men to read the same letter. The GOP is out of control.
gender had nothing to do with it! She violated rule 19. The GOP is running the show now.
Then why were men allowed to read the same words?
cause they werent already addressed for her bad language
Wasn't she silence because she was breaking the rules, not because of the content of her message?
No! Where did you hear this BS? But Trump & Co continue to break rules. Stop them!
Trump & co HAVE NO RULES, A TEAM OF DISGRACE, CORRUPTION,TRAITOR TO AMERICA,SHAME
LOUD NOISES!
You being my senator is unacceptable, California is turning into a third world country real fast because of you. #MAGA
California just surpassed France to become the fifth largest economy in the world. We are thriving.
People who don't like California should leave, we'll be fine without you.
@SenatorSessions Our new AG Congrats! Clean up the 9th Circuit!
chalk and cheese. He has nothing to do with the judges.
And- Sessions confirmation is a disaster for our Constitution and nation.
Nothing was worse then Eric Holder enjoy.
why didn't you vote against silencing her?
Great question,why you stay silence? Why you didn't support her. She Was humiliated,silence isn't answer
she is the most nasty woman I've ever heard. She's putting her political aspirations ahead of our country
No, that would be the entire @GOP
So over this. I don't care to read the letter now. Unless it was written in the last year. Politics.-Money /votes
The world is a very different place now! Why don't you get Alveda King's take on this? Betcha' don't chicken pucky!
McConnell needs to be taken on....embarrass like Trump!
pls vote NO on sessions
break the rules pay the price
Trump & Co doesn't have rules,why we have rules then?
@SenSanders All Dem Senators should stand in front of Capitol and Sen Warren read CK's letter.
lovely
Where were you during the vote? Were you there?
Where you been when Elizabeth Warren was silenced? What you did?
Pocahontas @SenWarren IS A LIAR, follow the rules!
do either of you know the background of the case Mrs King was referring?  I'll answer for you: NO
SHE is unacceptable
The core personality of a person doesn't change & this is what @SenWarren was getting at. Sessions isn't capable of being fair
NAACP award, Mrs. King's & Dem senators praised him a few years later. Just political posturing now.
@metallic_alec @SenWarren she is one tough cookie to keep fighting lady
Elizabeth Warren is insane. Just like you Dianne. Quit stealing money and start working. Idiots. #Treasonous
Elizabeth Warren is NO HERO. She lied about being  Native Am.Only loony libs in MA would elect nutcase like Warren.
other idea  senator,this letter should be your profile picture. Speak up for us
yes,read the letter up loud. In tv,on the street,radio station,do something for us ,please be brave we need you
Speak up,fight,resist,make America proud,vote no to Senator Sessions, we can do it. Trump & Co  A DISGRACE =DEVIL
support Elizabeth Warren,that was rude and communist ,no to  Senator Sessionsâ€™,his not fit for this position,nooooo
Beyond disgusting. I hope this means you'll be voting NO on Jeff Sessions!
you both know the rules of the US Senate. Warren violated rule 19. Words have consequences. Deal with it or go cry!
The letter you should read is your resignation---why not both resign
your constituents' voices are important too, but phones don't answer, no town halls. Do you remember US, Senator?
@JudiciaryDems @SenWarren Pocahontas doesn't belong in office...proven liar and thief. Hope none of you are reelected.
Hell, one of the few things Congress has done right for awhile. Gets my vote!
.@SenFeinstein do you know what @kdeleon has been saying back in CA? Admitting he has family members using fraudulent  SSANspay attention!
Then where was your vote Senator?
Please block Sessions from the position of Attorney General!
are two insincere politicians always trying to take the false high moral ground to advance their agendas.
Political crap like Pocahontas spews will end your declining party.
Thank you Senators! Keep fighting for us. #NoOnSessions #LetHerSpeak
.@SenFeinstein @SenWarren Untrue. She wasn't "blocked" from reading the letter. She read the entire letter on the Senate floor.
No on Sessions!!
terrible
@SenGOP @HouseGOP @SenWarren Clearly unacceptable!
GOP cannot silence the opposition-in a democracy, it is their job to listen. Warren is a champion-I appose Sessions
Please stand up there and read the letter also!
she wants to be president and can't even follow the rules of the senate probably doesn't know them term limits now
you people lost. get used to it. the liberal left is self destructing. we are in charge. 18 will further show that.
follow the rules then what do you think you're better than everyone else well you're not we need term limits
bull
.@SenFeinstein @SenWarren *tried to silence* Thankfully the words of both Sen Warren and Coretta Scott King will nevertheless persist!
fortunately @SenateMajLdr little tantrum only served to make him look like the petulant child he is. #ShePersisted
Thank you to my Senator, Dianne Feinstein and my hero, Elizabeth Warren. #LetLizSpeak
YOU read Coretta's letter to the Senate before the vote on Sessions.  You will make your constituents proud.
The Republicans are just wrong! Every day they look more ridiculous than the day before.
Old tired news. Nobody cares. Go back to your morning prunes and oatmeal Diane. You need the energy. #whyyoulost
Senator Warren grandstands and taxpayers have to pay the bill. If she just worked  half as hard for America.
I tried to call McConnell's office to protest, but can't get through. Looking for other ways to protest this.
I wish you were more like @SenWarren .  Lead in the opposition!  More dissent!  Represent!
Your voice is out of sync w/ Californians. Just saying!
@SenFeinstein 2/8/17 7:03 AM
@KamalaHarris 2/7/17 6:27 PM
12 hours 36 minutes late
Vote against Sessions!
reading 30 year old material?  Are your views the same as they were 30 years ago.  How pertinent was this?
Hope your next senator!
I don't think these Republican men understand how they energize women & blacks when they do this.
Diane, you need to carry on where Elizabeth was blocked. NO SESSIONS !!!  He shaming the name Jeffeson
every last dem senator should read this letter into the record
she's a idiot
you could stand to up the outrage volume by about 1000
thank you for sticking up for @SenWarren #letlizspeak
Silenced two important voices!!  #NoSessions
thank you for the belated support. CA needs you on these votes, please stand up for your state and your country and democracy.
if @SenateMajLdr hadn't done that, millions of people would not know about the letter. Instead he amplified it!!
They did that because she is filled with so much hate.She was being downright disrespectful! Serious anger issues!
She violated Senate rules. Remember - rules. New people are now in town.
Then please speak to it. Ask the questions @SenWarren was attempting to ask. #LetLizTalk #NoOnSessions
Travesty - but intent of Tea Party GOP under this President is clearly to squash dissent. Sessions is a disgrace.
Thank you both! #sheresists #stopsessions #letlizspeak
Silenced a biased opinion. Here's another one.
so much has change in congress and there's so much hate coming from GOP. Things must change!#weMUSTvote2018#butGod
Look fineswine, Fakeahontas broke the rules & action was taken.
Regardless of what you think, rules also apply 4 you libtards
The RLE (Radical Left-wing Extremist) group that you and your ilk are part off are in fact a hate group!
Who should we call today to express our disapproval of Sen. Jeff Sessions as AG?  Are any Republicans open?
vote yes to Confirm Jeff Sessions! I live in CA and have called your offices at least 100 times.
.@SenFeinstein @SenWarren yes, but the uproar it rightly caused has taken the story global. #PlanetTrump
absolutely! I will be calling your office later, but please vote NO on Sessions' confirmation. #Persist
so what was you voting yes on 5 outta 7 trump picks?
I am more and more thankful every day I voted for you. And will continue to vote for you. @SenWarren
read it again. Encourage your colleagues to read it. Get censored. Expose the farce. #ShePersisted #civildisobedience
You Have rules & she should have followed them when roles are reversed you jump at chance to shut people up
every GOP senator voted to silence @SenWarren? Not one stood up and said yes, we should hear this? #ShePersisted
pocahontas broke the rules. Pocahontas got put in check. Who will she be when she argues border wall Aztec or Mayan
@MaxineWaters What decade IS this? #ImpeachTrumpToday 
before he starts a war...
#LetLizSpeak
lost being creditable when she claimed she was a Cherokee Indian.
Credibility? Seriously? She has more credibility than Liar in Chief! #Impeach
says a twitter bot.
What are they afraid of?
