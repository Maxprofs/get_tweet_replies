(2/2) It’s up to the Department of Justice to ensure constitutionality of executive actions—White House must continue to respect this role.
Ok, but #STOPSESSIONS
you do understand that majority rules, right?  Y'all lost the election. Stop whining!
we all lost this election.
nope, America was saved from the depths of liberal destruction.
If you want Putin/DT's steady removal of constitutional protection, you're the enemy. Ignorance = Denial.
you are supposed to represent your constituents not just your party. Stop the partisan crap!
...the answer is YES! I can only assume you'll apologize for your comments & correct the record
Were Obama's? 
HELL NO! 
But, the SC ruled 9-0 13x Obama's exec orders were illegal
LIke it did under the Obama admin?
Are Chucks past comments being reviewed?
What are we doing to apply more pressure? We need a working legal system now more than ever.
Where is oversight protection? Checks & balances?Or does he just get to fire those who oppose?
did u act against obamacare executive order??
I don't know which country you're going to return to. Sure hope it isn't mine.
just vote no to AG nominee, no SCOTUS nominee,
DT is not playing by the rules...with no courage from GOP...can stand up, vote no on nominees of kleptocracy incl SCOTUS.
It's EMBARASSING that you took two days for a reponse. You no longer represent CA. Your entire career has been tarnished.
and who really thinks that Trump's cabinet will respect any "legalities"???
Are you? listen to the people everywhere in the US, or look at the pools or go home

You have voted for every one of Trump’s nominees so far. You must realize now how misguided that is. Please vote AGAINST Sess.
Sen Feinstein, I have called your DC & LA offices & cannot reach you. I am urging you to vote AGAINST Sessions.
I'd like to ask you, my Senator, to please stop voting to approve all of Trump's nominees. Thanks.
I am a small business owner in CA. Your policies have destroyed this country.
How many of @POTUS44  were reviewed? Asking for a friend.
Senate Democrats have an obligation to confront constitutional abuses by Trump!

REASON TO REJECT SESSIONS. HE WOULD RUBBER STAMP EVERYTHING. REJECT HIM.
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept But you don't want to be American. Make up your mind. Cal exit or not?
please ask for review of Reuters report on Russia giving Trump 19% share in Rosneft State Oil! Chris Steele risked life for us
Thank you for leading this effort! It’s the right thing to do. This is just chaos.
and what about your vote on Sessions? Vote no!
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems

@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept. Did you call for any past AG's to review any of Barry's orders?
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept maybe if you obstructionists would get his cabinet in place ...   #politicsAsUsual
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept Did you ask Justice about Obama's unlawful executive orders? Hypocrite.
Thank you!
THANK YOU SENATOR

Sen. Feinstein, I am requesting that we return America back to the people and not to globalists
In order for US to function & be her best You must confirm @POTUS's cabinet! No partisan posturing
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems Thanks for taking action!  Too much talking and not enough action against this corrupt EO!
Yes Feinstein, just like Obama's were!!!
Thank you, Senators. @KamalaHarris #JUSTUS
Senate confirms Sessions and SCOTUS pick in 3....2....1

@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept https://twitter.com/adudeinaplace2/status/826128506547478531 …
Thank you @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept ! Someone needs to check this madman!
I suggest you get your shit together and oppose President Sunny Delight and his minions.
I don't recall you being so diligent with Obama.  Why is that @SenFeinstein
how about because Obama reviewed the legality of orders with DOJ before issuing them? Ensured zero chaos?
Really?  Uh ok.
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept Crying baby!
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept you didn't think twice about Obamas many orders.
I can answer that. Heck no, they are common sense and fully constitutional.
Looks like Justice Dept gave middle finger to Democrats with "no comment" response. Great job!!
Hasn't everyone in justice already said that they are not being consulted.
How often do these people just say right thing so you will leave them alone?
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept doesn't matter what u did u old decrepit inept dingbat! Resign Resign Resign
I hope you will be voting against the remaining nominees like @SenSchumer.
how to contact you to voice my positions? Phones unanswered. VM full for weeks. A constituent
This is the leadership we need.  Thank you.
Trump has AG Session review, oh wait, not yet. Hey Senate, would you mind sending over the AG?
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept yes we want you to answer to the American people. We r the majority not TRUMPERS.
@dgarrick5534 we want him impeached
speak for yourself @SenFeinstein @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept
I am speaking for the majority, we want DT impeached.
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept You might stop delay tactics and get the cabinet confirmed!
Democrats are so powerless they want Exec. Branch to hold Exec. Branch accountable. Do Democrats hold themselves accountable?
Thank you Senator
@JasonTGaffney it's time for you to starting voting no on his nominees or to step aside for a progressive who will
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept   I've been wondering the same thing. They just seem so badly written
The LAWS passed by YOU are coming back to bite. We respect the LAW, so should all of you.
Thank You Sen Feinstein for your hard work!
@SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @TheJusticeDept What's to review... Keep the Muslims out. Pretty simple and what the people want.
so American and constitutional of you
