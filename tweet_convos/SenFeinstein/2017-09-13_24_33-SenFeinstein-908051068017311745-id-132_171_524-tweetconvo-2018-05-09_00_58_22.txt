Throwing us another crumb? Get on board with #MedicareForAll or perish. Enough is enough.
Why not just fight to increase support of Planned Parenthood and have the Ford Corporation automate the process?
The party that aborts babies REALLY
I've got 2 grand kids that are expecting and I think that would be great
IF someone gets pregnant. It is THEIR responsibility for their care and well-being NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S. Or don't have unprotected sex.
California constituent here, wanting you to support #MedicareForAll
Or we vote her OUT
Does this ring true 2 U?  AHC is DOA.  How do U expand HC that is failing?  Locate Keith Ellison on hot mic video; Utube.  Truth revealed!
This is a lie, Dems have us on path 2 Single Payer HC.  Just like baby Charlie in UK, we will face death panels, dwindling, not expanding HC
Yet you refuse to support Medicare For All both at the state level S.B. 562 or at the federal level with Bernie Sanders bill.  Please just
Retire at the end of this term and enjoy what your looted from the taxpayers for your husband's businesses.  You clearly do not represent
The interest of everyday Californians & are clearly out of touch when you think civility matters more than challenging the rise of neonazis.
Don't just "expand" health care, make it universal! 28 million Americans still uninsured, & millions more w/ high premiums. #MedicareforAll
spend, spend, spend
Just off what you said this sound fantastic.  Keep working for Americans.  You are a true patriot and a great Senator. Thank you.
THEN GET WITH SINGEL PAYER NOW???! OR SB562???
PLEASE DO SO WITHOUT US HAVING TO PAY FOR SOMEONE'S CHOICE TO KILL HER CHILD. HER CHOICE, SHE CAN PAY FOR IT.IF SHE CARRIES THERE IS HELP.
Support Medicare for all or step down.
You have not come out in favor of #MedicareForAll  JOIN US or you will lose votes. We are patient voters but we're losing our patience.
No lobbyist organization can replace lost voters. Just sayin.
How about that single-payer bill?
Your only committed to expanding your bank accounts! Youve swindled so much money from us, you should be shot! Oh yeah your above the law!
Ted Turner of CNN mentioned depopulation was a good idea on Charlie Rose
Go home
It's time either you join the right side of history of get out of office! #MedicareForAll https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJoJgPOVYAEjRVI.jpg:large â€¦
If she is not part of the solution, she is part of the problem! Vote her OUT!
Serious question. What is your reason for opposing #healthcareforall? I mean, how do you chose which Americans are worthy?
U think #healthcareforall makes us worthy? The medical establishment chooses who is worthy and who is not. Medicare can't buy their love
4,000 American babies die from abortion each day, that should be of concern to you.
A requirement should be that a women be married to get your pregnancy health care! Unwed pregnancy is a sin in the eyes of my GOD!
Is that a sincere statement or just another setup for Murdering unborn children.
Are u co-signing @SenSanders bill for Single Payer? I've voted Dem in Cali for 24 yrs & pd taxes for 25. My loyalty is DONE. I'm exhausted.
Out with the old guard - she doesn't work for us, she gets Ins $ kick backs. Vote her OUT
Thank you!  We need you to keep up the "good" fight for women's rights!
Sabrina, i hate to burst ur bubble ,but its women who r holding up women's rights #get on board women
Then give on the same covered you and your family have
You want to provide abortion coverage and make Americans pay for contraception.  Great new b's talking point
Ms. Diane- do you support PP? Does that "ensure healthy pregnancies - reliable maternity coverage" #disgusting senator commitment  lies
Can't have it both ways! Healthy babies while you kill those in back rooms! Shame, you're fired
Bump Day? How many men die from prostate cancer every day? Does any Democrat even care?
We may not die of health issue, we may just die because of tax burden. If i work you take away, why work ,i should be poor whole life  :-)
When ordinary americans expect a new tax bill ?,remember the story of giant peach tree, one day americans will be crushed under tax burden
Sign @SenSanders #MedicareForAll  Bill already then.
We're $20 trillion and debt and you're still spending?? Almost 400 politicians are millionaires taking advantage of government
There is huge public support for Bernie's bill. Stop taking money from insurance companies, support Medicare for All
If that's true, why aren't you supporting #BernieSanders #MedicareForAll ?
Your also committed to funding pl Parenthood ,the abortion mill. Is that the "expanded healthcare " you're speaking of?
Where were you today?
But are you committed to #medicareforall like Sanders & Warren?
Today I stood with @SenSanders to support his Medicare for All bill. Health care is a basic human right & we fight for basic human rights. 
All while supporting the murder of unborn babies and accepting money from PP who performs those murders.
Then support medicare for all- that's the best way to expand maternity care.
Its time for Universal Healthcare.We are the only Developed Country in the World without it.Stop playing safe, your constituents want this.
You do not support #Medicare4All and you will be ousted when we back @David4SenateCA
Sounds very catholic of you?  The dogma lives deep within you.  #AmyBarrett
The dogma lives deep within all of us. That's the point
Do you support @SenSanders Medicare for all?
#MedicareForAll Let do this
#medicareforall
You're nothing but an abortionist....
#MedicareForAll
I am guessing you do not want to run for office in the next election.
Why are you and Pelosi not supporting Medicare for all? I think that is a mistake for both of you We need relief from the high cost of care.
We love & support you Dianne!
Sign up for single payer Senator Feinstein, we need you.
WHAT ABOUT MEN?  WHAT DO WE GET?  DO WE MATTER?  AREN'T WE DESERVING? WHAT'S IN IT FOR US??????????????

What about Medicare For All?
Do you support planned parenthood? One of these things is not like the other 
Please support #Medicare4All
Remember Kate Steinle.
When will you support #Medicare4All?
Please support single payer, @SenFeinstein
#Medicare4All  MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!
Why R U so committed 2 gov involvement in health care.?The gov is terrible at HC! Look at Obamacare & the VA! Keep gov out! Help PVT HC!
#Sexist
R U supporting @SenSanders #MedicareForAll or not? #MyLitmusTest
Medicare4All train is leaving the station and you ain't on it.  The Dems are gonna lose again in 2020 bc of people like you.
You anti Christian bigot you need to RESIGN for your attack on a Christian nominee. YOU NEED TO GO!!
Get off the fence and support #MedicareForAll
except when you're committed to killing babies, assuming nasty catholic judges don't get in your way
yeah but support Medicare for all
Not enough! Please support #MedicareForAll
Don't you mean #abortionsforall?
When are you going to join @KamalaHarris and support #MedicareForAll? LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS!
Please sign on co sponsor medicare for all. You have always been a champion for your constituents
How about not receiving such a large financial hit from having a baby? #MedicareForAll
What about cosponsering Medicare For All. Medicare for all would do that.
Please support #MedicareForAll
Then give the same health insurance that you have
Let the states handle it.  Get out of our lives
Commit 2 the American ppl that voted 4 U,not 2 donors paying 4 UR ways 2 screw us!MEDICARE 4 ALL!It works,we know it & U know it!EXPAND IT!
Interesting that you keep taking money from lobbyists and haven't supported #MedicareForAll.   Talk is cheap?
Ah Yes - the unicorn or "pony" if you will - that every other developed nation  has had for decades and many times cheaper than US.
Make up your mind, you either want to kill babies or you don't, which is it?
What about pregnant men?
yet too many fucking people in america, literally
Then please support #MedicareForAll. As a constituent looking at 2018, this is a must do for me to support you next year
Come on DiFi, let's make California united on #Medicare4All or you're losing my vote. 
As long as .CA pays for its residents with our Federal aid
Great...what a hypocrite.  Healthcare is great as long as it feeds your corporate sponsors!
You dont care about americans
You idiot it is 830 WORLD WIDE which is down 44% from 1990. http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health 
Please support #MedicareForAll! Nobody should have to struggle even greater when it comes to their #health!
Amen
Which is an excellent reason to support #MedicareForAll Senator. I look forward to your co-sponsorship of the bill.
No way
#MedicareForAll Please support this so I can support you
So please, @SenFeinstein, explain to us CA voters what's preventing you from backing #MedicareForAll the way @flywithkamala does?
Makes sense, since we're at least 50% of the population and give birth to 100%.
When you can stand independent of Fed tax payers
And abortion on demand?
That's good tho. @AONNRecords
Hopefully this translates to a support for #MedicareForAll
Well, we have learned that the military has more than adequate access to Viagra.
#SinglePayer #MedicareForAll #TheFutureIsNow
Diane, the #SinglePayer  model shows Business/Companies fair financially better than they would just getting a tax break.
Great! Expand it under #Medicare4All #SinglePayer
But no one else should have to pay for my health care
Are you a senator representing Californians? 
I'm no longer sure...
Does this mean you support #MedicareforAll?  You carry such influence over Congress. So sagacious. Please strongly consider it, Senator!
Who the hell is going to pay for that we are broke
But you're not for Medicare for All? This Californian wants you to be replaced.
