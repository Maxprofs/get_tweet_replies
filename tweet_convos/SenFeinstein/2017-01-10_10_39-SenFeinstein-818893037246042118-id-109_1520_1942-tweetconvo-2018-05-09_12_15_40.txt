@Gladari   Liars always get caught.
All the Republicans will vote for Sessions and all Democratic against, so are there more Rep or Dem ?
There are more Republicans
So Sessions is in? Grr
Pretty much, yep. Racism, homophobia, and misogyny will end up being irrelevant...grr is right
Give me 1 example please
I have a lack of respect for him on a bipartisan level:)
You can't falsify your records and expect to get the job! He is a liar and just got caught!
How he was running the office that they were working out of.
SMH
why are we allowing this GOP take over. This is absolutely insane
They http://won.lol 
Senator Pants on Fire. The whole group is corrupt. #gop
@SenFranken   I am proud of the way you handled your questioning. You were respectful but informed. To me, very effective.
I just called Senator Franken's office to ask him to stop Sessions, a racist.
this article sums up Tillerson and his leadership
I was watching the confirmation and when @SenFranken posed this Q, if it was another lawyer, #GOP would demand disbarment.
He came rt back at yahoo Stuart Smalley
Please support Cory Booker!!!
@SenFranken #stopsessions #ImpeachTrump
@SenFranken how can you be unsure of your choice?
Thank you @alfranken
I wish we could get Franken to run for Pres in 2020. We are going to need someone like him.
Amy Klobuchar 2020!
Yes! She would also be a great choice.
Go back to comedy @SenFranken .  You're a joke. 
#ConfirmSessions 
Snap
Sen.Franken should be speaker, not McConnell #JustSaying Thank You Al Franken ;-)
OOPS!
@SallysOverTheBS @SenFranken keep on with the tough questions #nosessions #nojimcrow
The crummy part is that, if he weren't saddled by the comedy career, Franken would make a solid Prez.

LOVE AL FRANKEN
Say IT Franken! Make it real and lay it down in plain English.
@intoowit Senator Franken did a great job today!
#Sessions is 70 years old, which raises even more concerns. If his memory is that fuzzy he shouldn't be AG.
I saw that! What a lying liar, who's told many a lie....that you called him on ! #DumpSessions
@alfranken Sen. Al, I cannot thank you enough for your straightforward candor. Loved you since the 70's on SNL. You are real
can you say pants on fire?
Thus man is unfit for this large position! He was 1st to endorse DJT is not a skill set
huh? Another Pinocchio Sessions?
Trump cabinet picks seem to lie, exaggerate or plagiarize @SenatorLeahy Hold them accountable
Great job Al, but #GoldenShowers #PissTrump is the story now! We may need the old SNL Al back! #DoNothingForTump
Hey Al, you wanted to see a replmnt for Obamacare, did you read the original bill b4 you voted on it  MORON? NOT
Sen Sessions is the best choice for our next Attorney General! So proud of our next cabinet!
America doesn't need such a open racist bigot.  A professional liar. A disgrace and embarrassment to America
@SenFranken Good catch. Good job.
@SenFranken Thank you for asking the right questions of Sen Sessions and showing he's a liar. Cannot be trusted as AG.
@Rich_893 Franken did a great job!
He didn't seem to know a lot about certain cases but "he would certainly look into it further". Easy hearing! 

@exgci Harvard wrestler 1, Alabama lawyer 0.
@SenFranken I thought this was very concerning that he did not appear to tell the truth, why?
@SenFranken  did an outstanding job questioning Sessions today. Thank you, Sir!!
@PurlLeslie it is called the trump syndrome lies are better than truths
@fdjordanjr I don't understand why they've bothering with this. Is it to get Their complaints in record? He'll be approved.
Thank you Al Franken, the only senator I saw today who really nailed it #StopSessions #TheResistance #indivisible
Not having worked on something doesn't mean you can't take credit! I take more credit than American Express
@SenFranken way to go Senator Franken
@puppymnkey Liar. Liar. Typical for trump admin.
@SenFranken KEEPING IT REAL!
Anyone w such a poor memory (less than 20?) or pretends having poor memory (did I really say 20/30?) #LIAR #Sessions

Thanks @alfranken!
worked on personally...I'm sure
why isn't this a felony to lie on your submission?
Had doubts when Franken was elected to Senate but he not only washed those doubts away but has become one of my favorite Senators.
nice burn, Senator
@AZTanya of course, he didn't, he is a liar and we know it
@SenFranken #Trump SOP is divisiveness! There r more qualified less controversial options but of course #DJT craves neg attn!
What were you doing back in the 80's Al?Cocaine with the SNL crew. Joking & laughing &clueless while Jeff Sessions was serving the country.
and what were we doing in the 10's? Tweeting anonymity while sitting in our chairs clueless?
Au contrair...perhaps you are unaware, as is Mr. Franken, bit please do not attribute your ineptitude to those who make things happen in US
we both don't make power plays relax Mr fedora
truth bomb
@Nikluk The are rushing this hearing.
WATCHING AG HEARING SCREAMS TERM LIMITS. SESSION, HATCH & GRASSLEY 2 OLD. HEARING SHAM, RACIST SESSION TAKING US BACK TOO 19C
@SenFranken but Sessions had oped where this lawyer said he was of great help reminded me of when a car backfires
he is my hero of the day.he really got under Session's skin.
I have no confidence in #JeffSessions 
@SenFranken YOU ARE THE BIGGEST LOSER TO WORM YOUR WAY INTO A PAYCHECK FOR LIFE.. you are not worthy to be near Sen Sessions!
@SenFranken Wow, tough line of questioning Al, I'm glad you think the numbers matter????
@SenFranken seems you didn't listen to what he said
Because he's.........AL Franken. Jack hole then....and now. You're a joke, just like you were on Saturday Night Live as a cast member.
@SenFeinstein crooked lyin racist
That was fun, @JudiciaryDems @SenFranken LOL!   Just watched Sen. Cruz tear Franken's "case" to SHREDS
NO ONE believes Sessions, why would you?
@SenFranken It took a non-lawyer on a committee of lawyers to corner Sessions in a lie. Well done!
@SenFranken   Al Franken,  THANK YOU.
Thank you @alfranken Senator Franken for doing what's right for all of us! @JudiciaryDems
@alfranken did a fabulous job exposing Sessions. #ThankYou
My new hero!!!
@SenFranken Thank you, @SenFranken .
@SenFeinstein
We're really proud of our senators taking a stand! Thank you. We'll remember.
men like him and trump  always manage to tack there name onto other people's work and accomplishments.Without doing anything
omg who cares! He's more than qualified.
kinda like Merrick Garland, eh?
boom!
