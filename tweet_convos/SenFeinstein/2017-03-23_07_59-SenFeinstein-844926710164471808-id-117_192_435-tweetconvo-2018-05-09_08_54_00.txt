NO ON #GorsuchHearing
- No on Gorsuch. He is an "originalist" meaning he will judge according to his conservative whims
hahahahaha, the exact opposite of what an 'originalist' is.
Why is "golly gee, I can't comment on that" an acceptable answer for questions from Democrats? NOT OK
Dear Dems, Elections have consequences... In this case, it was Garland's nomination. BTW Gorsuch is better...
NOOOOOOOO on Gorsuch, Diane. NOOOOOO
please vote no on Gorsuch.!!!
don't vote 4 this wolf 4 big Corp 
The GOP voted for Hagan and Sotomayor. You Dems never supported a GOP nominee at the end of GOP POTUS term.
Garland's nomination is in the past. It's over. We're moving forward now. Stop the tit for tat. #confirmgorsuch
Today Jeff Sessions threatened to pull fed funds from Sanc. Cities. Delay vote, Filibuster #NoSeatForGorsuch.
#gorsuch
I hate that Gorsuch is put in the middle but Garland should've had his hearing. Trump isn't worthy to nominate
quick.....call a wahmbulance
You're like a mother who just can't accept the fact that your son wasn't chosen class President. Stop whining.
Yes Garland was named in waning months of Obama's term before election. Reds rightfully invoked the Biden Rule
Excellent point Rs totally politicized process If Gorsuch really stand-up guy he would step aside for Garland.
If Gorsuch stepped aside, Garland wouldn't be chosen. It would be the next one on Trump's list.
Obviously. But Rs left Ds with no choice after Rs put politics over nomination process.
Please do the right thing. The "gang" is tearing us apart. Laws are laws but there needs a heart to judge
Vote #NoGorsuch. His evasiveness = another mask of alt-right deception.
if #Biden wouldn't have started this  Maybe he'd be on #SCOTUS so #dems caused it!
the ABA means nothing to me. 10 yrs is too short to place an ideologue on the Court. Filibuster for Garland!
Who cares. His ability to be independent of the WH is a miss. Democrats should be wise and steer clear of him.
filibuster!
Vote to confirm
As a constituent of yours, I hope you'll help convince your colleagues not to filibuster.
Thank you. A filibuster does not serve the people of the country. It only fosters more division
This is not about #Garland Do your job and #ConfirmGorsuch Your name will be on my ballot - remember that.
Thank you.
.@JudiciaryDems @SenFeinstein
Dems have situational ethics, unencumbered by consistency or principle.
Judge Gorsuch has refused to be open about himself. Too many goshes & gollies & no substance. Please vote NO.
But Garland was ineligible for a vote. Joe Biden rule along with Schumer. 1992
You are after any excuse.
Ah yes. Feinstein shows her ignorance and total lack of awareness. AGAIN! Gorsuch is up.
Garland In, Russia Out, Gorsuch out
@jacksnowknows @SenFeinstein MERRICK GARLAND
@jacksnowknows @SenFeinstein Dems should leave hearings.. not legit ..shitgibbon under FBI investigation for possible treason
This is a lifetime appointment!!!!  Please don't approve Gorsuch!
Please vote NO on confirming this man.   Trump has no right to fill that seat.
Push for nomination withdrawal as #potus term will end within a year
filibuster! If you vote for him you lose my vote.
@SenSchumer U weren't to hold hearings. Get ur acts together! Stolen seats SCOTUS & POTUS
NO ON GORSUCH. From your constituent in 92629.
You are TOO damn old to act this juvenile.
stop all foreign aid. Pay instead for health care for all. Don't let anyone opt out as it will burden the rest
vote for Neal Gorsuch for Supreme Court justice. Vote no on trump plan. Work with senate on a better one.
#Gorsuch I agree with Senator Schumer. Please block his confirmation with a filibuster. #California
Take it up w/ Biden and Harry Reid! Go to your safe space and let grown ups govern. #Electionshaveconsequences
How is life with President Hillary, @SenFeinstein? Guess they increased your meds?
So do y'all commit to an up or down vote or not? .@JudiciaryDems .@SenFeinstein
Please vote NO on Gorsuch, Senator Feinstein!
Garland is an after thought. Elections have consequences. You make the picks when you win. Biden Rule in play.
BREAKING:
...Merrick Garland is not the nominee
...@HillaryClinton is not the President
...and @SenFeinstein is not sane.
@JudiciaryDems
I like pancakes. So what?
Until we know what happened with the election of current administration -- NO APPOINTMENTS and NO BILLS!
is in a furious race with @SenJohnMcCain to see who reaches full senility. Pass the Popcorn, the race is close!
Your fantasies are just that.
Poster child for #TermLimits
she would say garland was bad if trump put him up for scotus doesn't matter who it was
Senate voicemails are full. #BlockGorsuch - an administration under FBI investigation should be a full stop for that admin's nominee.
Which is, of course, totally irrelevant to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch.
That is great, but completely irrelevant here.
So?
Is @SenFeinstein saying she'd vote for Garland, but not someone she says is just as qualified? @JudiciaryDems
voted for Gorsuch in 2006 for his current judgeship. He received a unanimous voice vote in the Senate. @JudiciaryDems @Taznari
So?
#CrookedHillary lost.
Elections have consequences.
Atlanta almost won the Super Bowl
#ConfirmGorsuch
Sorry, who's the nominee for the SCOTUS seat? Stop your whining! #CryBabies
So what! This is not the Garland hearing, he ain't happening! Anymore irrelevant crap you fools gonna bring up?
Thank You Joe Biden and the #BidenRule
And Garland was nominated by a President who WASN'T under investigation for treason. @JudiciaryDems @SenFeinstein
Honorable Eric Garland deserves to be on Supreme Court, Neil Gorduch does not. VOTE NO
At least get his name right. It's Gorsuch. And he will be confirmed.
I know his name.  If misspelled, was a typo.
We can always trade a right-wing corporate tool like Gorsuch for a vanilla corporate tool like Garland
NO ON #GorsuchHearing chump & cronies r traitors & under investigation, illegit admin needs shut down TOTALLY.
NO on Garland! Please! Potus is under investigation, its a travesty if you dont join filibuster!
WTF making a point about #Gorsuch being "worthy" of this nomination??!  u r a republican and FRAUD! VOTE NOOOOO
so did Bork. Didn't stop your side, led by the Swimmer, did it?
silly snowflakes..He will get in thanks to Harry Reid
@SenFeinstein Please Vote NO! #GorsuchHearing
but will he support repeal of Citizens United? Gorsuch backed by Philip Anschutz, Dark Money #NoGorsuch
@maddow thank you @SenFeinstein for mentioning Judge Garland during "these" hearingsGOP wanted seat vacant if Hillary won
Stop talking.  The American people have spoken.
NO vote NO Gorsuchuntil FBI investigation of Trump is done#stolenseat GOP wanted seat vacant if Hillary won
I look forward to hearing "Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch" for the next 30 years or so.
Still going down the wrong path
I read this as "Judy Garland" and thought that was very curious. It's been a rough week. #Trumprussia
I want my Country back, retire
Retire
ABA rating has nothing to do with judicial philosophy. It can't discern judicial intent from a thin paper trail
Is she sick
sure would be nice if you could write in Garlands name! #stolenseat
More fake news
Get out of my Government
Democrats out of control
More fake news from the left
Stop stalling vote him in.  Yes
PLEASE VOTE NO ON GORSUCH, SENATOR. THIS IS A STOLEN SCOTUS SEAT, GIVEN UNDER A @POTUS UNDER FBI INVESTIGATION.
as a CA I support the filibuster
Thank you Senator Feinstein!
She should retire
Thanks having fun with this myself.  Just want my Country back.  Non Communist
bahaha!!! Garland? Maybe @DNC shd have picked a better Pres cand @HillaryClinton,who cares, submit to Elec will
The majority vote of the country?
bahaha! Yeah the Russians did that too right? Electoral 1 is what matters
but you Democrats did not have the votes in the senate to confirm him.
Filibuster, filibuster, filibuster.  We were robbed.
Filibuster Gorsuch nomination, Senator. Whenever I think of Gorsuch=corrupt WH
when I think of corrupt I think Democrat's
