we please ask for a vote of "NO" for Sessions.
I really didn't think it would be necessary to write or call u, a rep from CA,to vote NO on Sessions
He will never stand up to Trump & he definitely will not be impartial. He campaigned for him
Remind him he asked Sally Yates if she would stand up to the President if needed -- would he???
Delay? He should NOT be Acceped by @JudiciaryDems
Vote #NoOnSessions. The man has zero concern for civil rights, no matter how nice he is at the gym.
Dear Senator Feinstein, I am a California constituent that adamantly opposes Jeff Sessions! Vote no!
Senator, vote against approving Senator Sessions!  Don't be like Sen. Warren and don't let us down!
Are you really going to approve Sessions & tarnish your legacy. You're my fav senator. Please vote #NoSessions
PLs Vote NO for Jeff Sessions & DeVos!!!!
I'm a constituent and I urge you to vote NO on Sessions.
Demonstrators funded x George Soros (who expressed his intention to destroy America) is Feinstein's priority
Please do not vote for #Sessions. We need to show the world that we're not like him.
Please vote no on Sessions even if you don't get many calls. Thanks!
Even more important now to hold your ground, and principles, by not supporting inept, unethical appointees.
Rumor is you might vite for Sessions anyway.  Make us wrong about that.
As a constituent, I assume you are voting NO on Sessions. Any CA legislators who don't, deserve to be primaried

Your disdain for our country is duly noted! @chuckschumer broke his promis. No credibility amoung you
And you are a vulgar display of manhood, son. #GrowUp
It's a load of bull.  I guess she wants to lose MORE seats.   I hope they keep it up!
where was the women's march past 8yrs issues didn't happen past 4 days you're another hypocrite 4votes
@FoxBusiness What's the cohesive message of the women's march,anything & everything/What's the prob c/Sessions?
hope those up for election in 2018 thank you for their early retirement @SenBobCasey
on paper, sessions did more for "civil rights" than bill and hillary; you should've 'delayed' ypur endorsement.
good luck with this shit and your sanctuary city problem
Despicable what is going on with this delay. you have no proof of any of your allegations.Big sore loser
worked with Sessions for 10+ years. What the hell were you doing all that time? Sleeping? Delay is partisan BS
.@JudiciaryDems .@SenFeinstein If only you had offered such deference & credibility to the millions of #TeaParty protesters in '08 & '12
That's our woman!!!!!!! keep it up!!!!!
disappointing that you r holding up  sessions' cabinet appt. This woman wants him approved.
it's crap, she's doing it for the simple delay of him getting voted in and doing what she doesn't want
can't the old hag TRY a little not to be an OLD hag? #tooOldToThink
Thank you Senator for all your service. Please fight strong and deny this America
thank you @SenFeinstein
Thank you Senator @SenFeinstein
Delay is great, but a NO vote is better!
America is aware of and shall remember your obstruction and juvenile tactics..   crap where u eat!!!
: Why vote to confirm Mike Pampeo? You and 13 other dems keep failing to protect the people
@SenFeinstein@dacullington /2, Ross, Devos,Price,Carson.Price for HHS is shameful, Rex a threat to world peace!#Take Iraq Oil
@SenFeinstein@dacullington.Sen., I think the marches were tied to Trump and all the nominees he's named. Sessions, Tillerson,
