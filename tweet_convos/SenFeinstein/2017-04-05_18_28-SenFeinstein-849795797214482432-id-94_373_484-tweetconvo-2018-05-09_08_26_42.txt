Go nuclear, vote in Judge Gorsuch.  America first
Gorsuch is the most qualified! Drop your insane ideology for one second and vote for the good of our Country. Do one selfless thing, one!
Yeah. Vote yes on Gorsuch.
There should be a way to go to a Court to prevent the Reps from changing the rules in confirming a Supreme Court Judge as they see fit
Can you please save california from the brown road tax??
Both
Not a single democrat voted against him when he was nominated to the 10th circuit, the only thing that's changed is you.
what changed is they are throwing a tantrum over merrick
Yes, a valid tantrum.  Stolen seat.  Did you expect us to just stand by passively?  Not going to happen. Resist, obstruct, dissent, repeat!
Please retire.  California needs Term Limits.
To all Senators who twisted rules to confirm the nominee of @POTUS being investigated for treason: #historyiswatchingyou #countryoverparty
As he should:
@SenateMajLdr will you continue 100+ yrs of tradition & NOT #BlowUpTheRules 4 #minority #Gorsuch 
#HoldTheSeat & keep #SCOTUS #bipartisan
@SenateDems @AP He's not a democrat puppet. This is why you won't support him. Gorsuch WILL BE on scotus.
There's no reason beyond partisan politics to deprive the American people of a fully staffed #SCOTUS. #DoYourJob #crybaby
Their are 4 Democrats on thi tally that still put the country ahead of their party, disappointed you were not among!
Changing the rules for a nominee from @POTUS under investigation for TREASON is not a great idea. Come on, @GOP! #countryoverparty
@SenateDems @AP #NoGorsuch, we need someone qualified to represent all the people not just rich white men! All the ppl not few
@SenateDems @AP #NoGorsuch no way! We need a qualified SCJOTUS he is not the one! Need support for working families not rich!
Thx for fighting for us Senator D
We the people voted to have a Justice like Gorsuch. Forget Trump: you're disrespecting us. You've lost House, Senate and WH. More coming up.
Justice Stevens was aware, and humble enough to accept that, while he knew better about the legal…
sorry to see that U voted for Gorsuch block. while the Garland treatment was bad, Gorsuch is probably better than next Trump nominee.
Thanks for filibustering Gorsuch nomination! We are not afraid of @SenMajLeader. Let their corruption and ineptitude continue to unfold.
u are not working for the American ppl but against
Disgusting that Dems have tried to block Gorsuch. Acting like spoiled children. Confirm Gorsuch.
80,000 pages of regs under obama! No more!! Of course doesn't apply to you does it? But must control the dumb masses. Arrogant elitist
No greater clarity between socialism and democracy than wanting bureaucracy to have total control over people. Regulations out of control
how terrible, shift power from unelected bureaucracy! Makes me bigger fan of gorsuch. Means slimy pols would have less opp to corrupt
@SenateDems @AP 
We need honest men and women.
#confirmgorsuch.
@SenateDems @AP
Did KERRY lie,  are we being drawn into a war so Assad can be replaced by #ISIS ? 
#WhiteHelmets
@SenateDems @AP
@SenateDems @AP 
Why would Obama release these terrorists?
@SenateDems @AP 
Who killed these men?
@SenateDems @AP
@SenateDems @AP

@SenateDems @AP
@SenateDems @AP
Thank you for fighting back!
I'm told she's pretty smelly most days also. Im told maintaining regularity in advancing age has foreseeable but unavoidable consequences.
"@SenFeinstein: Justice Stevens’s Chevron opinion has been cited 15,000 times. #Gorsuch has called it into ?. http://apne.ws/2nxq3zo "
Why didn't you ask him if it was right for repubs to not vote on MGarland? Kinda late to tweet this out now,eh?
@SenateDems Thank you for opposing minority president and stolen SCOTUS seat. Anyone serious about healing holds hearings for Garland.
Dianne! Gorsuch is a phony. His sincerity is all an act. Its a shame our government is being systematically destroyed by the Republicans.
No appointment until #Trumprussia  investigation complete and acted upon
@SenFeinstein #GorsuchPlagiarism not suitable for a Supreme Court Justice- Resist
we don't want gorsuch.
2006????
I noticed!  And appreciated it! 
Dems claim to want an independent justice to stand up to @POTUS then poo poi his record of doing just that?  Enjoy extinction.
As he should.
asperger's?
So what? Everything can be questioned. The institution of marriage was left unquestioned for over 2000. Therefore should not be questioned?
You're not going to further humiliate yourself by screaming NO on the senate floor when Gorsuch receives the final confirmation YES vote?
The repubs want 2 confirm a plagiarist. The Supreme Court is supposed 2B above reproach. Just 1 more thing they are sullying.
This is important/dangerous. This should be enough to cause every senator to vote No on Gorsuch nomination, he's unsuitable for SCOTUS.
Stop being a obstructionist or retire!You rhetoric is getting really old! Do something with substance stop/sanctuary Ca !
So, no one can have a dissenting voice in your vision of Utopia?
and some of us call u into question....#termlimits
There's the Dem problem group think
Do you have an independent thought or  are you brainwashed tool
@SenateDems @AP We are with you Sen. Feinstein, pls hold the floor y #No Gorsuch for life! Not ready for this Dear God! #NoNG!
Breathe into a bag, everything will be okay.
As he should, I think congress needs to reassume the mantle of legislating and stop shirking their duty.
He should withdraw his name. #DrainTheSwamp
Yes and you've been like never cited for making common sense more of the Partisan non-sense variety.
Your disgusting u have no morals willing to smear a good man for ur politics or lack their of. U represent all that is wrong with the left
Yeah he's a NO VOTE
@SenateDems @AP Thank you Senator Feinstein ,we are with you! #No Gorsuch no unqualified lifetime sentence for working class !
- a thrill to watch you today from Senate Gallery, sharing constituent letters opposing #Gorsuch nom.
Garland--Nominated by popular two-term president-NO HEARING.  Gorsuch-Tabbed by minority-elected president-FORCED IN despite filibuster. Sad
Stay strong!
You may remember from your history books that Dred Scott was cited quite a few times too. Glad we abandoned that. You?
But the applications had different results .
Yes, but both were thought to be, for a time, good decisions.

It did not sound like Gorsuch intended to follow the law; more like he was eager to change it.
Uh, its not a law. He wants congress to write better laws. Thats their job.
It is case law.
