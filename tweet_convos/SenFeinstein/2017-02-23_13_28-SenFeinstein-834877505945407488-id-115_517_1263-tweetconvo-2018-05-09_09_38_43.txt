(2/4) The Trump Organization was recently awarded a trademark to market the Trump name in China—may be a violation of the Emoluments Clause.
(3/4) The Constitution includes the Emoluments Clause as a safeguard against foreign influence of officeholders, including the president.
(4/4) Throughout our nation’s history, presidents have treated the Emoluments Clause seriously. President Trump has not.
You won't win votes unless the DNC abandons corporate donations, that includes you! Me: dem my whole life, not again.
@KottiPillar Senator Feinstein, with all due respect, STFU. NOBODY CARES. #ImpeachDonaldTrump for TREASONOUS BEHAVIOR. Jesus!
I know, it seems like she's not acting, @ArianeBellamar but @SenFeinstein is on Senate Intelligence Committee investigating #TrumpRussia.
I'm sure @SenFeinstein can't legally breathe a word about what's going on, @ArianeBellamar + also to preserve evidence.
It's a DEEP web.
@AP
and what would you have said to Hillary and the Clinton foundation...?
Why you and your husband did not divest.
Stop the word “may”.  We all know he is violating the Constitution.  Do something about it.  Posting on Twitter isn’t enough!
you mean 2809?
IMPEACH
then stop talking and take action already!
U abrogated your duties while Abusive Barack Obama tore American Constitution to shreds. UR not honest. U've never been honest
.@SenFeinstein Listen.  In your opinion, does it or doesn't it?  Tired of the word "may". Please just tell it as you see it
Trump + Russia = ?????  Everything else is a distraction.
you have the wrong president because Obama undermined and walked right over the Constitution most every week
no He must be impeached along with Pence Ryan McConnell Chaffetz Priebus shall I go on. 
The election was illegal.
you are sick.
Please put some energy into enforcing this!
I read your letter to Trump. Thank you, and the other senators, for taking this important step.
so DO something about it already.
you must impeach!
Thank you @SenFeinstein
-must admit I was a bit unnerved when Spicer (mispronouncing your name) complimented you for being cooperative. PLEASE #resist
Lady DI!!

 YOU MUST RETIRE!!
Invesitgate & impeach.
they all say it's legal, Diane, the GOP says it's legal, who's going to have the power to stop them?
Impeach!!!!!
Pure nonsense...I see you have a gullible following who believe your b.s. No requirement to divest, you know it
What can we do to help you INVESTIGATE TRUMP'S POSSIBLE TREASON? #RESIST
No one called for Obama to stop selling his books even though sales skyrocketed AFTER he was elected. Double standard?
Says T/most CORRUPT SENATOR WHO'S HUSBAND BENEFITED FROM YOUR CONNECTIONS CROOKED DIANNE!No one should abuse power like u have
Trump is already in violation of the constitution, so why aren't impeachment proceedings underway??
what about your conflict of interest w/ high speed train. Your hubby got a $1B deal on?? How convenient is that?
Agreed, this isn't optional, this is mandatory.  The American people deserve nothing less.  #ShowMeTheTaxes
or #RESIGN
How about he quits instead?
you really have nothing better to do with your time do you? Don't focus on the economy or anything.
Please do what you can to further the house "resolution on inquiry" to figure out Trump's ties to Russia. It's most important!
can't we just impeach him and be done with it?  These people are from the dark ages.
Like others have said: we need more than a req! We need investigations & action. Do more than u've ever done. #Resist w us!
How about just impeach him?!  Do something instead of just complaining. He is incapable of doing the right thing. Impeach him!
a no brainer..where's the investigation?
WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. SESSIONS IS A CRONY AND WILL NOT RECUSE HIMSELF @SenKamalaHarris
keep pressure on while we get to mid terms. Pressure the DNC to fund one off interim elections happening in red states now.
Don't you have anything better to do? #MAGA 
#CongressCanRequest his tax returns. Please do so. 

@BillPascrell @IndivisibleTeam  @TheRickWilson @GeorgeTakei @BillKristol
lmao you have nothing on Trump...Hillary Lost
how true, What can we do? We are ready to work to help get him out.
@nbcjeanelle perhaps you madam, should report any profits from insider trading.....
true
What are you and fellow dems going to DO about it?!??! Let's get impeachment proceedings started already!!!
Dems need to get all documents from Comey otherwise there will be no America. It's disappearing piece by piece
Let's take a look at those taxes.
Yes he must divest! But he keeps ignoring every law, rule and standard. Impeachment or the 25th Amendment seems inevitable.
Absolutely agree. HOW are we going to do this
glad you and a few others are questioning and pushing.keep it up. Need to involve more dems and repubs.
He must be removed from office.
@Basterds_Fight It's a joke! Is it true that some govt jobs are being contracted to businesses he's worked with?
seriously ?? 

You continue to spread #FakeNews Trump has gone above & beyond to ensure no conflicts of interest and gain legal approval.
please get #45(*) and #President Bannon OUT.
if you're following Keith Ellison off the impeach edge then you are no better than the dictators you preach about!
@IndivisibleCRM #IMPEACH!!!! #comradeTrump! Chad He ain't NEVER gonna divest! Never! #traitor #TheResistance 
thank you 4 doing this! Sen Feinstein what if he disregards the request..have U determined a next action?
He must be investigated! #russiagate
but he won't. Will he be held accountable by anyone?
Impeach!
You're wrong, you've always been wrong. Look where it got us.
So do something about it?
Please insist. I cannot understand why an independent counsel has not been formed to address these issues.
They need to go! @POTUS @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @jasoninthehouse @marcorubio #Trumprussia #russiagate #ImpeachDonaldTrump
lol divest. lol prosecute. The king ruler does what he wants, his system keeps allowing it.
please do something about this!
@Hillaryh4444Hos How about just impeach him?  He is off to Mar a Lago again. Another $3 million that could help real people!
Sorry @SenFeinstein but as long as #JeffSessions is AG there’s no one to call on the #USConstitution
This is #RussianStyleCorruption
Yes!!!! Please pursue this ASAP along with Russia.
Please, Sen. Feinstein, fight Trump's violations all the way!  Also demand Trump's taxes. Americans DO want to see them.
@LOLGOP you must insist
@DavidKoechner he'll just change the constitution
get his mafia ass out of there
how can we help you convince the senate to investigate?
Nothing will stop. He and cronies have complete control because the Republicans back him. It's futile.
Why are there no Comgressional investigations of this and the Russian connection?
Also, The Trump Hotel in Dubai,UAE(were previously unable to open!)opened shortly after Yemen Raid. UAE wanted it badly!!
You are my senator! Please continue to represent us and fight Trump every time he or his cronies are unjust. He must divest!
where we're you with HRC money raised from other country's?? I'm embarrassed for for you..pls retire!!
Please, fight today's war and leave yesterdays to deal with later.  We are now in a fight for rights, democracy etc
we need to see this tax returns! Don't back down. Millions of us are holding you up in spirit.
go get him senator!
Thank you. I am one of your constituents. Please pursue this vigorously.
He is in violation of the Emoluments Clause.  Did you hear Bannon today?  Get these people out of the White House ASAP!
*MAY* put him violation of the Constitution?? Sheesh. The Chinese trademarks are the least of it. Subpoena his taxes!
"May?!"  How many conflicts of interest does he need to stack up before you are sure?!
Thank you! This is just 1 of several key reasons to impeach Trump. You are becoming a part of an historic time in US history!
Thank you Senator!
Senator, Trump (plus Bannon and Gorka) will destroy our country. We need to find a way to stop them.
Better late than never @SenFeinstein, I guess. It's been a whole month.
So when in the h#ll is somebody gonna DO something about this?  TALK TALK TALK......
we need to impeach him that idiot trump and his administration
they are dangerous
Make sure you have a large contingent of firefighters handy when 45 crashes and burns. Can you get me tickets?
They should put him in jail Dianne!
tell that to the republicans
YOU PEOPLE MUST DO SOMETHING ON OUR BEHALF HERE.  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. HE MUST BE IMPEACHED. NOW OR NEVER.
That's hilarious coming from you.
That horse is already out and now you want to close the barn door?
Get his Tax Returns! NOW!
