and obamacare is going down in flames.  you are a good reason for term limits for ALL politicians.
ACA is not failing.  It has saved >100,000 lives since it was enacted.

In direct opposition, #AHCA would kill 28,000 Americans a year.
Were you crying hysterically when you typed this garbage? Are you a HC expert? Your #'s are what MSM is putting out. #Think4yourself
Those numbers are from the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, and Harvard's School of Public Health.
You are welcome to check their work.

CBO: "#AHCA would result in 23 million Americans losing healthcare": https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/hr1628aspassed.pdf …
Harvard School of Public Health: "1 death per year is avoided for every 830 Americans with health insurance" - http://annals.org/aim/article/1867050/changes-mortality-after-massachusetts-health-care-reform-quasi-experimental-study …
Do the division: 23 million / 830 => 28,000 more deaths per year if #AHCA is enacted.

That estimate has a 10% uncertainty.
CBO health insurance coverage assessments are verified to be good to ±10% by comparing 2010 CBO forecasts for ACA to HHS data from '10-'17.
#CallYourSenators Health coverage TODAY, doesn't guarantee U have it tomorrow. #CircumstancesChange DO NOT allow @GOP to #ToyWithYourLife
They said 40-50 M ppl would get insurance.  19M total... failure
You'll be begging for Obamacare if you end up on trumpcare. trump calls the current plan "mean". Deductibles will be too high to use it!
And they implode in '18

Cute memes.  I see a LGBTQ theme. Are you part of that community?
Kind of like you and @NancyPelosi did with obamacare?  Pot calling the kettle black.
More like pot calling kettle broccoli.   There were months of public hearings, debates, committee meetings & markups b4 ACA was approved.
With both sides getting input?  I think not, you are on the other side this time.  Don't like it huh?  Welcome to my last 8 yrs.
House bill was shaped by 3 bipartisan committees over a period of several months b4 it reached the floor. If GOP chose not to participate...
Yeah yeah we all know how that goes
And you took all the suggestions and flushed down the toilet.. Ask Gruber..
I am concerned about GOP's attempts to keep their health care plans a secret not only from the people but especially from the whole Senate.
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @SenateDems @chrislhayes Dianne, ur tweet is right on point. Repub's will own their words&actions #ShowUsTheBill 
I remember Tom Coburn singlehandedly holding up entire Senate for weeks at a time cuz something didn't sit right with him. Be like Tom.
How many times did David Vitter do this!
Health Insurance is not a right. Shut r down!
Neither are jobs, or roads.  Or electricity.  Or sewer systems.  You want to give them all up too?
I'd like the federal government out of those businesses. Yes.
You are going to do everything in your power to stop this bill too, right? Including withholding consent and filibuster by amendment?
McConnell shouldn't have got rid of Senate 60 votes that he wanted under Senator Reid!
Tell them say no to Pete Peterson Foundation money funding this attack on social safe net! I am disable!
And ACA sucks
And yet they still didn't know what was in it-Pelosi
tried to call to support #ShowUsTheBill but couldn't get through.
Senate repubs r out of time. Koch brothers must pass this now or never have another chance. This is what desperation looks like.
If trump made a deal with the Russians, Sen @SenFeinstein
then what deal did trump and his campaign make with the insurance industry?
They will pass the bill, blame the ACA for the problems it causes and people will believe them
Democrats must block this vote by any means. Deny them a quorum if possible. Please. The people have no other champions.
And McConnell stood up and lied about that.
Senator, both sides need to work on fixing O.C. as costs continue to rise(today 1 carrier said costs going up 43% next yr), compromise.
Dems make it clear they will obstruct and vote for NOTHING, now mad they've been removed from equation.  #consequences
Keep it up-appreciate all you do for healthcare justice
I haven't been able to reach you by phone-NO on Republicans' "mean" bill. OPEN THE PROCESS!
Did any involve Republicans in any meaningful way? Curious now…
17 months 900 pages and u showed u were too stupid to get it right. So we do not want ur stupidity involved with a bill that will work
And senator - how exactly did you pass Obamacare? The bill that had to be passed "so we could read it"?
Please withhold consent and ask @KamalaHarris to do the same and all Dems. We must take drastic action to stop this catastrophe.
What do the American People have to do to stop this madness?!
As @senatemajldr himself said, there were a "gazillion" hearings on health care.
This is a full scale "revenge" storm on Obama's administration.  Obama really got under cheetohead's skin at the correspondents dinner.
This is the Real Death Panel
Yeah I remember you idiots ignored the progressives to pass a lobbyist Bill. If only Dean had been chief of staff
I think you should see it too, but wasn't it Nancy Pelosi that said "you need to pass the bill to see what's in it" on Obamacare
They had a different problem... 1000+ page bill with tweaks for a bunch of Congressmen. That said, much better than AHCA.
"We have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it".
Thank you, Senator Feinstein, for fighting for us against this corruption.
Remember when you Dems shut out Repubs during the initial passing of the ACA? Where was the bipartisanship then?
Shut out implies they never tried to work w/GOP.  They did, but GOP preferred sit on their thumbs and get paid for not doing their jobs.
And you still couldn't get it right when you closed the doors to vote. Wimpish.
Repeal doesn't need debate.
I intend on filing suit for involuntary manslaughter for every death they cause for tax breaks for wealthy. Every senator and POTUS!
Why are Democrats in Senate not involved? Is it constitutional to deny media coverage?
#VoteOssoff TODAY! #SendMessage @GOP #DoNotToyWithMyLife #CountryBeforeParty #PublicHearings #GA06 #FlipItBlue #HoldTheFloor #HealthcareBill
Nope! #DealWithIt. What you guys did with ObamaCare is coming back to give you shitheads a taste of your own medicine! #FuckTheDemocrats
Got to pass it to see it per @NancyPelosi
#ShowUsTheBill
You have to pass it to see what's in it seems to ring a bell or did Nancy Pelosi misspeak? What HC plan do the Dems have to replace OCare?
Oh here you go
ZERO HEARINGS to reduce the cost of healthcare.
A bill crafted in secret can nit be a good thing for America. #Fear #GOPSelfLoathing #VotOutGOP #RESISTANCE
Please give us back our constitution so many died for grandfather honorable discharge heart attack! Please help us fight no violence!

Aca - $13,000 deductible so stop calling it insurance that's affordable
When are you going to catch the clue that Senate Republicans neither need nor want your input?
The GOP and Mitch McConnell wouldn't be able to get away with this if it weren't for Trump! I don't believe he was sincere say "mean"!
Here
Thank you @SenFeinstein for your hard work on behalf of Californians and all Americans. #HoldTheFloor
Nonsense. Dems did the same thing to pass the existing fiasco. Bunch of hypocrites.
And look how that worked out.
Watching you speak on CSPAN. Wow! Well done, thank you.
Thanks for fighting for us!  Keep up the pressure and continue to call out the the GOP senators for their callous approach.
Thank you for standing up for healthcare & treating people w decency! #HoldTheFloor
Term limits for the "do nothing " demised Democrats who do nothing but whine !
Thank you for trying to defend all of us #HoldTheFloor
3. My children moved out of state for post doc education. They were able to continue coverage until coverage in MN kicked in 60 days later
You look very pretty in red.  You are my favorite Californian Senator.  Thank you for being clear and expressing your argument well.  
2. They have had lower drug prices. They have had serious preexisting  medical conditions covered.  Their insurance prems have stabilized
1. My patients have greatly benefited from the ACA. Their college age children have been continued on their insurance
Take control.
#ShowUsTheBill
@SenateMajLdr horrible man shameful
Now you resort to lying? We gotta pass it to see what's in it remember?
And yet "you have to pass the bill to find out what's in it"?... seems your facts are off
5000 Amendments. They have to listen to every single one.
Keep up the good fight Senator. You are fighting for every American. Thank you. I have two children with disabilities.
The common thread is shitty pro corporate welfare, do I win a prize?
Keep fighting. #FilibusterByAmendment #WITHHOLDCONSENT !!!
@SenToomey @vp #showusthebill
Calif needs to start operating like it's own country. Make it happen.
Stop it.
You lost, get over it!
@SenFeinstein was ok with the same activities for Obamacare...? Where was the faux outrage then?
Thank you for fighting!!
Then why did obamacare have to be passed before anybody could read it to see what was in it?  #fakenews #propaganda
Democrats were so open w/2,700 page unread bill you had to pass to see what's in it. MEMORIES! OH we can play that way back right? U did it!
If it's a secret, than why are you telling people what they are going to loose and what Republicans are planning to do to people?
And that's the program Dems came up with? Let them work, Diane. You don't have to control everything.
Sen Feinstein - Not one patient care org or medical group supports it. Use that.
exactly numbers don't lie , compare and contrast
We really do live in Russia now. It's really scary.

#WITHHOLDCONSENT #HoldTheFloor #filibusterbyamentment #ProtectOurCare #IAmAPreexistingCondition #SavetheACA #gopdontcare
There's no there there
How can we get out of this mess ? It appears nothing and nobody wants or can stop the downfall of our democracy.
And massive GOP amendments.
AND Nancy Pelosi saying "you have to pass the bill to know what's in it."
Yep
Why?  Nancy didn't read the last one.  Just keep on resisting - good talk.
Yeah Obamacare was a huge failure remember sign it read it later
@SenFeinstein contact @WilmerHale who is authorized to represent and litigate for us and insure the bill does not violate any of our models.
there should be nothing in any bill that violates our Trade Secrets or IP rights whatsoever, LEO has almost completely collapsed here. @FTC
@SenFeinstein also contact @FTC & @JusticeATR whom have a history on this issue but have failed catastrophically in resolving it.
Reminds me of the Patriot Act.
