Recuse those involved. Keep pushing for investigation.
@LeslieMarshall @ChuckGrassley FK U Senator! Sad!

Stop being A$$es. Investigate #BarackObama & his 30,000 henchmen via @OFA trying to usurp #Trump. #Sedition
@KottiPillar @ChuckGrassley It's the least you could do. We're out here waiting for this madman to nuke us all.
... an open bipartisan or independent investigation.  You are courageous and we need you! Thank you.
he did not drain the swamp he dredged it
@TrumpResist @ChuckGrassley TY, Senators. However, a "briefing" will NOT satisfy the Anerican public who expect ACTION

Yes, but we need to go further, and quickly to create a select committee on Trump and his Russian Connection.
On behalf of all Americans, THANK YOU! #persist #resist #treason #impeach #Flynn #Russia #Yemen
By lack of cooperation, are we to assume @DevinNunes and @jasoninthehouse are compromised? #Treason #RussiaGate

@Twytterpaytyd @ChuckGrassley Sessions cannot b involved. He was on Trump campaign & connected to Carter Page-Russia

Thank you for investigating this issue of communications with Russia.  Our Democracy depends on your efforts.
yes! Yes! Let's fight for our Democracy! You are a Champion, Hon. Feinstein
#IndependentInvestigation needed democracy in danger from Russian meddling. Trump encouraged it.  Release taxes
both of you better bring crying towels so you can cry on each other's shoulders and some crayons to draw with
Thank you for your push for transparency!
And Please don't take no for an answer!!!  Be a Bulldog!
Thank you, keep going.   Please call for an independent investigation.  The American people deserve to know.
Grateful.
Dems must bring the Senate to a stop until there is an independent investigation into Trump's Russian ties.
Thank You Senator I admire your tenacious and determined efforts. Keep up the pressure on this please.
Thank you. In this time of crisis, we need bipartisan, cooperative action for the good of our nation.

before/after briefings on illegal security leaks, Obama FISA wiretap requests, and NSA intel share rule change

a For the sake of our democracy, an independent investigation must take place. Please push for
Thank you ! Keep pushing for the truth
we need an independent bipartisan committee investigation
very eager to hear details. we need further inquiry as to who knew what & when. thank you!
@BeauWillimon @ChuckGrassley Anything short of a full, independent investigation into the entire Trump team is unacceptable.
@Amy_Siskind @ChuckGrassley Thank you for your efforts, Mam.
Not the FBI!!  They are co-conspirators!!
thank you my Senator!
Thank you.
you promised an outside source would investigate Russia/Trump. Start fundraiser for it. U will raise enough $

Damn. I've never seen so many #lemmings in my life running after more crap.
thank you!
@BeauWillimon @ChuckGrassley thank you!
We need more information. Time is of the essence. IF Russia has compromised #POTUS, the US is in imperil.
keep the pressure on..WE DEMAND THE TRUTH!!
I am sorry but FBI with Comey?
THANK YOU
you are both Patriots and not political hacks!  Thanks to both of you!  The world is watching!
Thank you!
@Amy_Siskind @ChuckGrassley the #FiveEyes must know exactly what happened. Why don't you request all avail intel?
Thank you Senators. The American people deserve to know the truth and why Director Comey @FBI  hid it from us.
@Amy_Siskind @ChuckGrassley when (not if) the @NSAGov shows you that #trump et all worked with #Russia will you #ImpeachTrump?
great! But really, at this point, don't you think we NEED another election? America has been compromised.
thank you
Thank you for pushing for this to be looked into!
Thank you senators. We are watching and waiting for answers.
Have I told you today that you and your staff are rock stars!
We DEMAND immediate INDEPENDENT Commission on Russian Espionage & Collusion ("committee" investigation=bury)
Sessions inserted Page into campaign. He is both a suspect &  witness. Should recuse himself from investigation
Since these #Leaks happened prior to Trump taking office, then we have a much bigger problem !!
exactly!  hello James Comey+
Could you perhaps ask them to include the REAL report about HRC? That would only be fair..wouldn't it?  YES!
First they tried to hide it now want to cover it up. We need to thoroughly investigate the Russian connections.
Thank you! Impatient to move to an independent investigation after what should be a quick review. Report asap
you know they are just gonna lie to you, right?
Please work to establish an investigative body that is truly impartial. Thank you for all you do!
yes, please get a full investigation. Very concerned!
Wonderful. We need you to do your due diligence on this entire matter that has legs to it. Thank you.
thank you for doing something.
Good and pls ask to investigate Trump's relationship with the Russians. And his tax returns
Thank you.
I see from the Post that McConnel has to approve to proceed. I have no faith in his desire to get the truth.
As a Californian, I thank you for your service to all Americans! #russiagate
Thank you. Please continue investigations. The American people deserve the truth.
Thank you! Trump stole the presidency. Now he is trying to steal our democracy!
This needs to go farther. The American people deserve an independent investigation.
Than you! @SenFeinstein @ChuckGrassley
Thank you for pursuing this topic.
Very good.  When will our leaders have the courage to consider that this President may be mentally ill.
The people deserve an immediate and transparent investigation of Trump ties to Russia including his taxes.
You must be relentless. The Republicans are betraying us at every turn. We'll have your back if you have ours.
she only has her wallet in her back (pocket)
did Grassley ask for money to even attend the briefing? #dumpchuckgrassley
Thank you! We need to know how deep this goes.
you should also demand investigation of POTUS and his tires w/Putin. They've met sevrl times prior2his campaign
Thank you both! Please push for independent investigation. This should not be handled by partisan committee.
Huh. Sensing a shift in ole Chuck.
Please continue to push for a thorough investigation of all ties to Russia on the part of Pres Trump and staff.
Please take this to an Independent Commission/Investigation...make it non-political so we can sleep at night
@car0_55 this is huge. Bipartisan.
thank you, Senator Feinstein!
thank you for that
Great Senator.
