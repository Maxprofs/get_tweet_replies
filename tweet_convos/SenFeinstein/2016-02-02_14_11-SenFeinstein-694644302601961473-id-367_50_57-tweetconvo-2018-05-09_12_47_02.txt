More private gun sales happen online than in person. I applaud @Facebook for the decision to prohibit gun sale posts on its network.
This important decision by @Facebook will prevent dangerous criminals from avoiding background checks.
@SenFeinstein  The two-party system needs to be abolished!  Both major U.S. political parties are corrupt!
@SenFeinstein here's a novel idea GO AFTER THE CRIMINALS.
@SenFeinstein @EliadDagan Prove it. There's no way to buy a gun online from a legitimate supplier.
@EliadDagan @SenFeinstein Why they use this argument  Drugs are illegal and you can get them if you really want them. #CommonSense
This turns out not to be the case. Have you purchased a gun online without a BCG? #gunsense @SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein You're a LIAR! I dare ANYONE  2try & buy a gun online! You'll have to fill out forms & your gun is sent to nearest FFL dealer!
@SenFeinstein You have to have a FFL to buy guns online or have it shipped to a FFL who must do a background check- no loophole there!
@SenFeinstein another lie from Fineswine.
Liar!
@SenFeinstein
@HarryThetech76 @SenFeinstein I can't decide if she's a liar or a moron..
@Monkey3ddd @HarryThetech76 She's been "my" Senator since I was 7. 100% positive she's lying to fool actual morons.
@DefinitelyMike @HarryThetech76 Well quit voting for her. :)
@Monkey3ddd @HarryThetech76 I actually voted for her in 1992 when I was a first grader, because no one asked for my ID. 
.@SenFeinstein Not a shocker that you don't understand the Law.
@AmidstTheNoise @SovereignGuy @SenFeinstein Isn't it funny that our elected officials who are responsible for making laws don't know the law
@bigdaddydoggie @AmidstTheNoise @SenFeinstein No. No its not!
<==Lying sack of potatoes.
There are all the same regs for buying on line as if you walk into the store.
@SenFeinstein Umm. This is a lie. Shame on you.
@SenFeinstein words without action, time to retire
@SenFeinstein Attention all foreign entities that want to attack America: California & soon 2b NY, is/will be totally unarmed. [sarcasm]
@SenFeinstein Try it and see if you can get a gun that way. Why do you lie.
@SenFeinstein How is it that one who is actually involved in the legislative process is so woefully ignorant of the laws she helped pass?
@SenFeinstein That statement is either a flat out lie...or you don't have a clue what you are talking about.
@SenFeinstein is this an honest lie to push the liberal agenda #FactCheckThis
@SenFeinstein this dumb broad
@SenFeinstein what planet are u living on? This is absolutely FALSE
@SenFeinstein Where? What country? Why dont you answer us? Answer for your LIES.
@SenFeinstein Shouldn't you learn a little bit about firearms law before bleating such nonsense at the public?
@SenFeinstein That's an absolute lie and u know it
@SenFeinstein That's entirely false
@SenFeinstein - complete and utter BS! They are shipped to an FFL and you have to go through the Che k to pick them up.
@SenFeinstein I guess when the truth doesn't fit your narrative you just tell giant lies.
@SenFeinstein I have bought 1 firearm in Dec & 1 in Jan, from the Internet. BOTH times, a background check and 10 day wait. You are lying.
.@SenFeinstein you are a fool. When a gun is purchased online it is sent to registered dealer where buyer must go, pass BGC to pick up gun
@LLH713 @paphotog @SenFeinstein 
Come on ~ As if that ever stopped a Politician 
They dont let facts get in the way
@mplay0000 @paphotog @SenFeinstein exactly... Play on emotions and forget truth
@SenFeinstein  What's hard to understand ...just where things went wrong....she started out looking so....good?
@SenFeinstein What's worse than you lying about buying Internet guns without a background check...is the liberal idiots who believe you!
@SenFeinstein that's an outright lie,try again
@SenFeinstein I've bght numerous guns online.They were shpped 2 a licnsed FFL dler and HE prfrmed the BC. How do u not know how this works?!
@SenFeinstein @facebook if u know nothing about something keep your mouth shut please.
@SenFeinstein @facebook not true.  I buy online & do background checks w/ my FFL.  YOU ARE LYING TO PPL FEINSTEIN.  Tell the whole truth
Liar. @SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein Liar.
@SenFeinstein Lies or Stupidity--Guns must be sent to a licensed fire arms dealer who then does a background check.
@SenFeinstein A lie. You buy, they ship to dealer, you fill out forms for background check and must pass before being handed the gun.
@SenFeinstein Give it a try dimwit.
@SenFeinstein Shouldnt u actually know the law before you spout off about it? Or do you enjoy looking like an idiot? Total LIE.
@SenFeinstein How did SanBern killers get their guns? Or get into country? Start there if u wanna help
@SenFeinstein lol liar.
.@SenFeinstein When SCOTUS upholds 4th cir. Kolbe decision, & strikes down most of CA's gun laws, I'd give a lot to see look on your face.
.@SenFeinstein It seems unlikely you don't know this, which suggests you feel a need to lie to advance your anti-civil rights agenda.
@SenFeinstein gun are shipped to a ffl to be transferred. And there is no such thing as the gunshow loophole.
.@SenFeinstein Incorrect. Guns purchased online, must be shipped to licensed dealer who is required to do "traditional background check"
@SenFeinstein Liar, Liar
The #LeftLoons like @SenFeinstein live lies like this 2 feel good about themselves & vote 2 kill unborn/elderly/disabled & feel fine.
@SenFeinstein blatant lie.   You file for background check before you can pick the gun up.
@SenFeinstein what lying gibberish
@RickCanton How the hell anyone with half a brain elected her I DON'T KNOW
@SenFeinstein Why don't you stop and research before commenting. Online purchases have to go through licensed dealer, complete with BGC's!
@SenFeinstein wow!!! Its amazing and embarrassing to see how UNEDUCATED a senator is!! Its mind boggling!!
@SenFeinstein You need to remove this tweet immediately. Absolutely untrue!
#GunsInAmerica #guncontrol
When guns are purchased online, a buyer doesnâ€™t have to go through a traditional background check. This is an easily exploited loophole.
@SenFeinstein That's a lie and you know  it !
@SenFeinstein What a lie. Please just resign now. You have become an embarassment.
@SenFeinstein you really should learn the law before speaking.
@SenFeinstein That tweet is not true. I suggest you try it yourself.
@SenFeinstein why the lies? Must be sad having to cling to lies to support your cause
@SenFeinstein Stop lying!
@SenFeinstein you have no idea what you're talking about, again. Retire, please.
@SenFeinstein you are an elected official just spewing lies. You should really learn the law. Omg...and we wonder why we get attacked!!!!
@SenFeinstein What an awesome lie. I've had to fill out the paperwork twice when buying online. Second was when it was picked up at the FFL.
@SenFeinstein who elected this moron into office??!!! Dumb-ocrat no doubt!
@SenFeinstein (((Liar))) Anyone who believes this should try.
@SenFeinstein you should be ashamed by your comments madam. Ur job is to secure our rights not I fridge upon them
@SenFeinstein you are such a liar. Why?
@SenFeinstein isn't ur state overdue to fall into the ocean?
@SenFeinstein Where can I find those online?   have only found people to meet @ an FFL dealer 2 purchase, with BGC.  #gunsense @DLoesch
@SenFeinstein that is a blatant LIE! #LyingLiarThatLies
@SenFeinstein If you don't know the truth, before you misinform, research the FACTS!
@SenFeinstein that is an utter fucking lie. The gun is sent to an #FFL before transfer to do a background check @NRA
@SenFeinstein Incorrect
@SenFeinstein Reprehensible bullshit.... you people are sick twisted liars... do you bother reading the law?
@SenFeinstein What cretin on your staff told you this. Fire them.
@SenFeinstein You sir are a twit. Try reading sometime, kinda helps.
@SenFeinstein Lie! You've clearly never purchased a firearm online.
@SenFeinstein total bull crap
@SenFeinstein This is an ignorant lie. You and Mr. Trump need to have someone read everything considered for Tweeting before hitting "send."
@SenFeinstein lie
@SenFeinstein U are either uninformed or deliberately lying. Every gun sold online is shipped to a federally licensed dealer who runs check
@SenFeinstein..that is such a false statement...only your uninformed voters believe you #tcot
@SenFeinstein you should know, your whole career exploits loopholes
@SenFeinstein ...liar liar liar!!  Why not get some facts b4 you prove to all how ignorant you are?
@SenFeinstein Repeat a lie long enough and people will believe it...But you know that, don't you Senator?
@SenFeinstein that's not just disingenuous, it's a flat out lie. You are despicable.
@SenFeinstein you need 2 lay off the bourbon lady; you know this statement is total BS. Guns R shipped to FFL dealer who has had BGC! #moron
@SenFeinstein liar, liar, pants on FIRE.  
@SenFeinstein
I'm pretty sure you took an oath to protect &  defend the Constitution, @SenFeinstein so stop telling fibs.
@SenFeinstein you can't possibly be this ignorant,  can you?
@SenFeinstein Dear Mrs Feinstein, If you are unaware of how online guns sales really work, how can we trust you to legislate on the issue?
@SenFeinstein   You need to educate yourself before you make these statements that should embarrass you.
@SenFeinstein Its frightening that uninformed people like you are making laws.
@SenFeinstein It would be really amazingly awesome if people like you who are paid to legislate actually had any idea what the laws say.
@SenFeinstein absolutely untrue. Firearms purchased online still require a b/g check at the time of transfer. #ignorantrep
@SenFeinstein Lady, quit blubbering about something you have no clue about. I can tell you from experience u r a liar!!! #Butch52 #getaclue
@SenFeinstein That's just total bull shit. Go ahead and try. Prove me wrong.
@SenFeinstein This statement is a complete and TOTAL lie.  How dare you prey on your ignorant constituents? @NRA #2A #WakeUpAmerica
I purchased 2 online, which were sent to a local FFL. Had to go through background & 10-day wait.  My Senator, @senfeinstein, IS A LIAR.
@SenFeinstein who are you, one of #Jerry'sKids
@SenFeinstein why do you lie?
@SenFeinstein I think all that corrupted money you have received has slowly rotted your mind to believe things that are not true.
@SenFeinstein LIAR
@SenFeinstein LIE
@SenFeinstein This is a flat out lie, Senator, & you know it. ALL sales go through a FFL & purchaser is subject to same background check
@SenFeinstein No need to open your mouth, we already know you're a fool.
@SenFeinstein you can't even send a gun through the mail, if you're not an FFL
@SenFeinstein maybe you should read the federal laws regarding online sales of guns. It's illegal to ship a gun to anyone not an FFL
@SenFeinstein Can u provide a link for one of these supposed sites that sell guns without a BGC? I think somebody's pants are on fire....lol
@SenFeinstein And you're wrong- again.
.@SenFeinstein Dare you to do it. Because I think you're lying or don't know what you're talking about.
.@SenFeinstein Prove it. Buy one without passing the bkgrd check. Film it. Put it online.
@SenFeinstein totally wrong!
@SenFeinstein There are liars, damn liars and Democrats... THIS IS NOT TRUE!  Online purchases are shipped to an FFL for background check
@SenFeinstein Wrong. But you know that. I assume even you are not that ignorant. Just trying to justify eroding our freedoms and rights.
@SenFeinstein That's  another damn lie. When weapons are bought from a retailer online, purchaser must pass a federal background check.
@SenFeinstein wrong and a blatant lie...somebody please educate the low level staffer running this account
@SenFeinstein Bullshit.  18 USC 922 requires all online sales to go through an FFL Dealer.  Anything else is a felony.
@KC_EDM @SenFeinstein Easy EDM -you can't expect a sitting Senator with an axe to grind over guns to be honest.....
@SenFeinstein false! Quit lying!!!!
@SenFeinstein That is an outright lie. If you go to an online gun retailer, it is shipped to a licensed FFL 2 complete background check.
@SenFeinstein read the laws you pass.  Must go through FFAL.
.@SenFeinstein Who told you that? Have you tried it. You live in Cali. I dare you
@neeceetx @SenFeinstein Feinstein should really just shut up...
@Buster3PointO exactly she has no credibility. Time to retire Granny @SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein BS On-line gun purchases have to be shipped to licensed dealer 4 pickup. #liar #2A
@SenFeinstein how is she still in office? Shouldn't she have been aged out by now
@SenFeinstein Untrue. All purchases must be sent to an FFL. You don't know what you're talking about & you're making laws?
@SenFeinstein And you're the Chair of the Intelligence Committee? This is unacceptable and just doesn't happen. Facebook is a puppet.
@SenFeinstein That is an outright lie. Are you a liar, or STUPID? Choose one!
You're a liar. Interstate online sales must go through FFL (w/ BG check). Intrastate sales by FFLs must have BG check. @SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein Thats an out n out lie Senator!
@SenFeinstein It's blatantly false that you can buy a gun online & forego a background check. Are you dishonest, ignorant or both? #TRUTH
@calaiscl200 @SenFeinstein I would pick all of thee above
@dallas_413 @SenFeinstein It's within the realm of possibilities I Am inclined to believe!! #TRUTH #PJNET #IDIOTS #INTEGRITY #MOLONLABE #NRA
@SenFeinstein YES. THEY. DO!!! If they don't they're breaking the law. START trying to stop CRIMINALS!!! not law abiding citizens!!! #derp
@SenFeinstein 
That is a bald faced lie. You think we are all as stupid as you to believe that statement. #dolt
@SenFeinstein that is an absolute lie.
@SenFeinstein  If you actually believe that then you are not qualified to hold office. That is blatantly false information
@SenFeinstein Any purchased online is shipped to a fed licensed dealer. All paperwork is filed and approved, you knew that already,  right?
@SenFeinstein What the HELL are you talking about? Retailers don't ship guns directly to purchasers, and BGC you when you pick up. Liar. #2A
@SenFeinstein This is a lie. You know it's a lie. Pathetic.
@SenFeinstein stop lying!
@SenFeinstein Bullshit.
@SenFeinstein You can keep saying that this "loophole" exists, but that won't make it true. #2a
@SenFeinstein Federal law requires firearms purchased online be shipped to an FFL dealer, who will then conduct a background check. #2a
@SenFeinstein not true at all. This is a total lie
@SenFeinstein Liar liar... That absolutely does not happen.  You know it.
@SenFeinstein Liar, liar, pants on fire.. This is as false as the "no BG check is required at gun shows" myth. But the truth doesn't matter.
@SenFeinstein That is a lie, you ignorant moron...take your meds...
@SenFeinstein @RaySr1946
@SenFeinstein untrue! You are a liar! Why don't you buy one online, and display to us how this would happen.
@SenFeinstein <---idiot.....
. @SenFeinstein LIAR
@SenFeinstein  This is NOT TRUE unless you are making a straw purchase through the Fast and Furious program.
@SenFeinstein Seriously, you need to retire and spend some quality time with your family ...
@SenFeinstein u r a lying fool.  U know it is illegal to sell a firearm over the net w/o background check
@SenFeinstein the people who elected u are idiots.
.@SenFeinstein Lying dirtbag. Tell the truth.
@SenFeinstein I thought you could only lie with impunity from the floor of the senate.
@SenFeinstein are you an idiot or a lier.  Please  clarify.
@SenFeinstein Are you really this ill-informed or are you willfully lying? Which is it?
@SenFeinstein The only loophole is between your ears!
@SenFeinstein you are clueless on this. Check w ur local ATF to correct your msinformation.
@SenFeinstein This is essentially a lie and you know it. Firearm has to be shipped to an FFL who completes background check.
@SenFeinstein you are an absolute liar.
@SenFeinstein please link any relevant sites to back up your preposterous claim.
@SenFeinstein we should close the loophole where taxpayers' money aides in the purchase/delivery of baby parts.
@SenFeinstein Senator, obviously you have no idea about federal gun laws. That's sad but not surprising.
@SenFeinstein Lie
