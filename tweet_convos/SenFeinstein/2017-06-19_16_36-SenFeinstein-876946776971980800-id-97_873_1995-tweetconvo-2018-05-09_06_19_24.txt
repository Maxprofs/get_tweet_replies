Especially when that's how Nancy & chuck did it when the democrats where in control of our government
TrumpCare is coming soon to California
Shut them down. No consent. Vote-a-rama. Whatever it takes.
Sad, but POTUS can push it thru. He is sooo desparate to undo everything Obama did and at any cost!! OBAMA has u beat in every way possible!
Grrr!
While true, the overlap between medicine and health is actually rather slim.
CA is a RICH state, so they say..  Take care of your own.
CA wants millions of illegals on health let Calif pay for it themselves.
And women's healthcare is a subject that should be addressed by women
@SenFeinstein there is nothing wrong with #GOP working behind closed doors, at least they are working.
Didn't care about that when Obama laughed at GOP during ObamaCare writing.. #Hypocrites
Lost a kidney..my job & now have a rare deadly illness. Meanwhile..your evil colleagues in the Senate plot #MassMurder4Hire 

#ShowUsTheBill
It's also the last segment of the economy where the government should interfere . . . 
What do you people find so hard about freedom?
This is precisely the kind of nakedly fascist #WeThePeople-screwing behavior that chews away the already fragile seams of our #deMOCKracy
Lead follow but mostly get out of the way your a dem. Y'all don't have a clue or a solution just the victim card
Yeah no republicans allowed in the closed door meetings I remember and so did 67 million voters for trump
Well it was during Obama care
WE THE PEOPLE FULLY EXPECT OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO TRANSPARENTLY DO THEIR WORK ON OUR BEHALF.  NO SECRETS.

I remember, the ACA was debated out in the open. I watched the entire back and forth on C-Span. The ACA was signed into law on my birthday.
you did it with obumer care, REMEMBER, the brain child pelosi, WE HAVE TO PASS IT TO SEE WHAT IS IN IT,  was just a tax increase cost bill,
Health care never belonged in the hands of govt in the first place.  Dems have broken the US health care system forever!
there must b some gop that believe in process and want to open door and let voters know how bad this bill can b for all.
Here's a fun headline from 2009 - where was Feinstein on this one?
Dianne, you are forgetting something.
Agree, 
So why only protest when Republicans do it?
Don't you remember what your colleague said, we have to pass the bill to know what's in it.  Duh
Congress should not get to pick and choose which part of this job they do. You ask for it, do your job and let us see the bill.
How come Pelosi said we had to pass it to see what's in it? How is that different
The public doesn't get to vote on it. It's up to the Senators we sent to Congress to cast a vote on the bill. DEMs won't vote for it anyway.
"Bailing out car companies" and "Impeaching the president" should all happen in Public, too.
Many of my patients will loose vision without insurance. Don't keep them in the dark. Open up the process - let in the light! #HoldTheFloor
What McConnell is doing to the American people w/ GOP secret #AHCA is antidemocratic & smacks of a third world dictatorship Please #Resist
#ShowUsTheBill
#ShowUsTheBill
Thank you #HoldTheFloor #ShowUsTheBill
Rep. Scalise voted for the AHCA let's hope he doesn't lose his healthcare because he won't get coverage again...he'll have "access" though
Remember,in the words of @NancyPelosi nancype
, "We have to pass the bill to see what's in it." #democrat
Filibuster by amendment!
Thank U, Sen. Feinstein, SO TRUE!
@SenFeinstein: Why haven't you and other @SenateDems introduced a #singlepayer bill? #DemExit @GreenPartyUS
Great speech tonight! Thank you for working so hard!
So do your job.  Get this bill into the light of day
Through parliamentary procedure @SenFeinstein can you require any Senator who votes on the bill to certify that they have read the bill.
please don't let gop take away health care i don't want to go back to having no insurance again
Are we all just sitting around Tweeting now?
Yeah, that would be like saying you had to pass a bill to see what's in a bill, wouldn't it?
That's the way both parties have handled healthcare. Here's a thought, get the govt out and there's nothing to hide.
Hidden behind closed doors & away from public view is how children view monsters and how adults view healthcare. There isn't much difference
Why not propose ALL elected officials give up their wonderful Healthcare to be like all of the rest of us pens?
Like how all you clowns did it?
#ShowUsTheBill
Ban assault clips.
Mitch McConnell just lied to the American populace. Said all that want to be involved are involved. Liar liar!
#passthebilltoseewhatsinthebill
'Member thaaaaaat?
I've contacted @SenToddYoung but haven't heard from him - unfortunately, I think he's chosen party over Country & 1% ovr voters & 99%
#ShowUsTheBill #NoHearingNoVote
Senate Dems have stated they will not negotiate with @gop on failing ObamaCare replacement. GOP took then at their word
Americans need to hold @GOPSenate accountable for the deaths for so many who need long-term care.  @SenateMajLdr needs to get a heart.
Well stated. A lot people seem to think they should be in charge of our bodies.
At the end of the day, it is OUR health and for crying out loud, OUR money!
U got to pass it to see what's in it. Per @NancyPelosi
Check your history Patrick.  Write back when you know how many hearings were held for the ACA.
I did your homework for you.  79 hearings in the House, 181 witnesses, 100 hours, 239 amends. considered.  Senate - 25 consq. days hearings.
So you have abandoned your "closed door" argument. Your next one makes no sense either.
It is disgusting and reprehensible of Republicans secretly killing citizens in their lust to trash health care: EVIL
They have to HIDE it Because
They are FEARFUL of OUR INITIAL OUTCRY in UNISON 

THAT WILL SHAKE the EARTH!
Too bad as the Dems did a terrible job on healthcare by redistributing money from the working class to the non working class.
That didn't stop you in 2008.
#ShowUsTheBill?  Your input isn't wanted. Your approval isn't required.
We voted to repeal. Get to it.
Agree. And thanks to my two senators--Feinstein and Harris--for working so hard to support our basic right to affordable healthcare.
You have a duty to protect your country & to the international community. This has never been seen in your history. Restrict his access.
I think I luv Dianne...
Having this discussion with friends. People are scared. Please, do all you can.  We are counting on you all, Senator.
@NancyPelosi said u have to pass it to see what's in it
Did you criticize @NancyPelosi in 2010?
Reptilian wretches in the @GOP r trying to bankrupt working families by taking away our health insurance. Call your senators!
(202) 224-3121
We'll have the last word when we VOTE republicans out of office in Nov. 2018.
@NancyPelosi said u have to pass it to see what's in it!
like the post office deal you did? how much money did your husband make?
This is what happens when your Whitehouse has been infiltrated by a Russian imposter puppy. Don't expect a tea party.
What did Nancy Pelosi say last time? You've got to pass it to know what's in it. Tee Hee Tee Hee.
Sorry about you reading and comprehension impairment.  Perhaps Besty DeVos can help you with that?  Tee Hee Hee  (eye roll)
"you reading"? Who has the impairment?
You, my dear.
