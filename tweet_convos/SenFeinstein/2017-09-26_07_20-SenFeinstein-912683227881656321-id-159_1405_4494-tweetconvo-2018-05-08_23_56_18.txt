It's time to waive the Jones Act permanently for Puerto Rico.  Putting shipping profits ahead of hurricane victims is immoral #Puerto Rico
@god @jesus @Pontifex @santaclaus @KensingtonRoyal @Davidpetraeus58 they are having massive spirit attacks from shadow spirit w/ metal works
Don't tell her that Puerto Rico is 85% Catholic or her and Al Franken will never let aid money pass.
Despite your crazed imaginings, the Senators are not anti-Catholic.

They merely respect separation between church and state.
Sure, whatever
What a well-reasoned and eloquent reply.

Or did I just use too many big words for you to understand?
cutebut it wasn't me that said she was "catholicphobic" it was her, or were here words to big for you? 
Transcript please?
What was that trickle down theory again? Where r all the super rich? Are they helping? Planes should have been sent a week ago!
Thank you for your support of our battered island. Now lift the #JonesAct It only hurts Puerto Rico now and in future.
Agreed, send them guns for self defense asap.
Hard to believe your authenticity on this when unwilling to address the issues in hometown SF with Academy of Art and Stephens' corruption.

Focus, people are dying!
Funds, troops, USNS Comfort, please

I think these funds should have already been approved. The devastation already happened. They need funding today.
According to @DavidBegnaud Live reports There are supplies sitting in the docks in Puerto Rico why haven't they been distributed yet?
So glad you let's us know.  We are lacking any ability to know that, right? Get to work or give us educated information about actions taken

Puerto Rico needs help where is the hospital ship usnsthey need serious help our president needs to help and anyone that can needs to help
Why are we discussing limiting free speech at football games when people are starving, dying because of hurricanes?
Yes and send navy ships to help evacuate and feed the people
They desperately need fuel. Why can't we get it there. Forget that Jones act
Thank you. Why aren't our people on the ground?
Problem senator Feinstein is you hate Catholics and you call Puerto Rico your fellow citizens well how mellow is that ?????
Trump is wasting time because he does not want to help what he considers immigrants. His ignorance goes beyond comprehension.He is horrible!
Senator, had they been predominately white affluent people, funds would have been there day one. Consider what/who you're working with. #45
Do understand how Govt works or was this an emotional response. Congress needs to pass a bill to fund the relief effort
It’s not just $$ — it’s boots on the ground too. This is an emergency crisis and govt can respond.
Lets help each other and send in a fleet to help them recover and move into shelters
Heard of the JonesbAct? Needs to be suspended
You mean:Proud to join my colleagues thanking @POTUS for doing a fantastic @fema job to help bankrupt Puerto Rico. Govt. run like  Democrats
Government funds are taking too long people are dying getting sick in Puerto Rico they need to help now this is America Puerto Rico
Agree, you should also retire
Or, just take a knee
Waive the Jones Act!
Just remember that they were first devastated by Democrat policies.....
Send troops now!
@god @jesus @Pontifex @santaclaus we have lost couple young people every year so losers like shelomova can wear skin of white as outer shell
@god @jesus @Pontifex @santaclaus @KensingtonRoyal everyone's using heaven for witch not aging for 30 years & I am sick of dealing with them
It's all misaligned from witches like Will Smith pretending they are my sister willow & Emma Watson using my sister Holly's husband's family
next Tuesday is not an option.
And what's happening with DACA ?
Federal funds should have already been approved...what's the hold up ?
Thank you Senator for listening to our calls.  Thank you for taking action.
unacceptable it hasn't already happened... if it was rural, white Mississippi it'd be a different story altogether
Does the Senate have to wait for Trump/WH? Can't a support package be put forward immediately?
These funds should have been approved days ago as well as USNS comfort sent to aid those with medical needs
Thank you senator! Please call on congress to repeal the Jones act. It will hurt recovery, and is crony capitalism at its worst.
Soon, like yesterday. Also, please suspend the #JonesAct so #PuertoRico can get more help.
Thank u sen we need help w logistics & guards @ island to transport diesel &  goods to the west, south & center of the island @KamalaHarris
Yes they need so much help.
Thank you for your efforts to help Puerto Rico. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta
@Wenican repeal the jones act
And waive the Jones Act

Thank you, Senator. It's clear the WH is not going to do anything, we need bipartisan emergency relief for our fellow citizens IMMEDIATELY
They were stop making it sound like it didn't happen just wrong
Let them receive goods and services from around the world
I agree. To not waive the Jones Act is cruel

It has not declared an emergency?
S T A T E H O O D
This is too weak, from the senior senator from great state of California. Who panders to Trump. Yesterday, and send the Navy today.
Approved last week sept 18th
Why is it taking so long to help our fellow Americans?
We need to send in the Army and someone like Gen. Russell Honore'.
We need airplanes to go there and take all the things we have collected! Use whatever power you have to make it happen!
Trump was silent until he was forced to respond.  You see...Puerto Rico doesn't vote.
How about now!
Should already have been approved, this was foreseen by many.
WE SHOULD FOCUS ON REMOVING @realDonaldTrump FROM OFFICE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.OUR PLANET IS AT STAKE.WE ALL KNOW HE'S A TRAITOR & UNAMERICAN
Hurry!  The very poor human condition doesn't allow for much lag time...
NEW VIDEO: 1 tweet then back to his NFL obsession. Trump is letting Puerto Rico die, because its people are Hispanic
Yesterday,DT blamed Puerto Rico for causing the devastation ofMaria & never reached out to help them--unfit, vile coward
Yes I agreed but Trump is asleep at the wheel
Can congress manage to do that without adding in partisan crap that has nothing to do with aid? Holding lives hostage is getting old fast.
Tell your colleagues to stop trying to repeal the ACA and help Puerto Rico.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
Please introduce emergency legislation to help #PuertoRico now! Don't wait for trump. We have no president!
Yes thank you Obama for all you have done for not making people wait in misery when they needed something. Respecting Liberty and freedom.
Send some of your 40 plus millions you got since in office
THEN DO IT! Have a press conference Now!
Well, what is keeping you?
Federal funds should be approved TODAY. #whataboutPuertoRico
Virgin Islands need help also!
Can't wait until oct!
How many of you sit here and complain on twitter and pass misinformation  around... griping what others should do,  what are you doing ?
According to @POTUS that's October.

Agreed
Not only funds but boots on the ground.
You just voted YES on $700B for more WARS. So sick of you, DiFi. Time to RETIRE.
Did you know your fax and email aren't working?
it is not a state and their finances were as bad as our own 700 billion dollar deficits:  you will go down in history as being a detriment
Hell YES!!!
Make a personal $10m pledge and lead the way
Military should send a couple of AIR TRANSPORTABLE HOSPITALS via aircraft w/INSULIN/dialysis machines--talk to McCain/Make it happen.
People are dying for want of INSULIN, DIALYSIS and WATER, Dianne.  This needs to happen TODAY.
Tell that to gruml
Please do something to get Congress to move on this, Senator.
Don't forget the Virgin islands and the other Caribbean islands.  All need assistance.
You are a Leader in the the US Senate do your job...  Twitter won't create legislation... STOP THE POLITICS AND HELP FOR GOODNESS SAKE...
Are you bringing this to the floor today?
Like, yesterday.
Do your job Dianne.. stop all the babbling !
The money has bern allocated...Congress is the entity that needs to act...do your job Di
37 mins ago ? How do you a Sen not know this was done LAST week? https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Maybe @realDonaldTrump can help with his billions?
He did... why you so ungrateful and anti America?
okay Bot - pfffftttttt
Ok, that was a lot of  big words... easy out for you , "BOT"  Enjoy living in your bubble!!
such a cute little trinket Bijou - keep up your best bot work....
Thanks, will do!! I support my country and my @potus.... you should give it a try,  will look much better on you than the name calling u do.
You need to give that info to Mark Takano. He's lying to people, telling them nothing is happening.
Immediately! just do the paperwork afterwards. Call an emergency session,why is this all of a sudden full of procedure #PuertoRiconeedshelp
https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Please, Senator, what can Congress do to make this happen? And now?
Puerto Rico's government bankrupted itself and now has no money for anything.   Let's help the citizens, not their government.
Hmmm. Dickie just said exactly the same thing. Guess you got the memo
And send USS Comfort now!!!!!!
Send AIR TRANSPORTABLE HOSPITALS first--they could be operating TOMORROW if they were sent today.  Like an inflatable MASH UNIT.
You all must watch cnn don't get news https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
How can we make that happen, now? I understand it's urgent. So painful to see. Who starts the ball rolling to get the $ to PR & VI?

It’s time to rewrite the presidential duties. Take this away. Give to Homeland Security.
Show your support! #Fuerte #PRstrong
How can we help Puerto Rico the President has to deal with the tough matter of NFL players peacefully protesting
'as soon as possible'? How about yesterday? Or last week.
Was last week https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
puhleeeze Senator! get profiteering out of health care! its just wrong to hold cures for ransom>free healthcare and education helps everyone
There was a mass shooting at a church this weekend, but black on white, so Dems and media not interested...
They approve the funding, yet they're on here complaining about Potus. They just taking their time to approve funds for Puerto Rico.
Why hasn't @realDonaldTrump gone? He certainly jumped on coming to Texas and getting in the way. He doesn't CARE!! He'd rather fight w/NFL!
Can everyone make a few calls to congress and demand help for Puerto Rico this morning? You are my Senator so I know you've got me covered.
Was signed sept 18 https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Yes and not sending help for a week or two.
Let's take a moment to thank #obama
For promoting tourism to Cuba 
While puerto Rico was on the
Brink of bankruptcy 
He did not promote tourism to Cuba. Just tried to normalize relations with them.

Either cite your source or stop lying.
Yesterday would have been great for approved funding. Matter-of-fact ~ day after Maria spread her devastation! #FundingNow please. 
How do u not know this? https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Trump is far to busy squabbling with sports teams to care about such things as suffering and devastated US citizens.  Thank you for caring!!
What a rude thing Potus did it last week do u get the news https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Can you do a sit-in or something on the floor to demand action? Our "president" is a heartless sociopath who is incapable of feeling empathy
Already done days ago signed order for FEMA as was supposed to do  u must watch cnn
You're a clueless bot. Blocking.
Blocked you lol. Not clues just trump supporter and you???
So sponsor a bill? What are you all waiting for???
Already done by Potus last week https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Watch fox not CNN
Feds should contract with cruise lines to provide support #HelpPuertoRico
Nope. They can't help because of the Jones Act 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/the-latest-pelosi-calls-for-military-help-in-puerto-rico/2017/09/25/86d85f02-a209-11e7-b573-8ec86cdfe1ed_story.html …
Maybe we should wait for trump to learn how to be president. #primary We need new blood from California
Awful he did the signing for FEMA LAST week://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-
Agreed, but Prez Drunpf is too busy fighting tweet battle with NFL.
45 is blaming Puerto Rico . Picking fights with sports teams and threatening nuclear war. Please help stop this madman before it's too late
How ridiculous he did signing FEMA bill last week
Isn’t that your job?? When’s the last time our senator visit every county in California like the Senator from Minnesota. #termlimits
Please pry the phone away from text man and get him ON IT
So rude and unAmerican https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/18/president-donald-j-trump-signs-emergency-declaration-puerto-rico …
Agreed.  Are we certain that @realDonaldTrump understands that Puerto Rico is part of the United States?
Agreed
Are Puerto Ricans Americans?
Today!!! 
Why aren't funds approved, yesterday?
ya but what about "taking a knee"? Isn't that important? (sarcasm)
How much more embarrassment will the .@GOP allow the to bear?  Another country is likely to send #PuertoRicoRelief before we do. SMH.
Take the lead Senator! Our president is more interested in disparaging Puerto Rico than helping them
Good Tuesday, @SenFeinstein of SF,California
Let #trump send them his #salary.
He doesn't take a salary
