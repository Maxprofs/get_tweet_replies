@SenFeinstein What are you going to do?
@SenFeinstein democrats have a lot to answer for all your political correctness. What are you doing to protect Americans from terrorism?
@SenFeinstein we have ppl out to kill us because of THEIR religion & it is validated to do so in their holy book. call it what it is! terror
@SenFeinstein. We must cut off the entry & money to countries who hate us. Muslims will continue to commit MURDER.
@SenFeinstein I encourage all California residents to take up arms regardless of the Nazi gun control laws, take up arms & support the 2A!
@SenFeinstein was this bldg a gunfree zone like Paris? Every sane American shd be packing!
@BAM4AU I hope you realize how stupid you sound.
@LA_Denizen like Paris -a gun free zone does not stop shootings
.@SenFeinstein We mourn together.  We need your leadership to help us in these dark times. We need your heart in SB and your influence in DC
@brieloskota @SenFeinstein this is her leadership. .
@SenFeinstein hey Senator, didn't you state this?  I guess your idiot Nazi gun grabbing logic failed.
@SenFeinstein Do something.
@nbwulf @SenFeinstein she did....she said this...
@SenFeinstein are you sponsoring any gun reform legislation?
@SenFeinstein Please take action and propose some gun control legislation! We can't keep the status quo if that means DAILY mass shootings.
@SenFeinstein Make CA an #OpenCarry state, like AZ.
@andycutright @SenFeinstein I can absolutely guarantee that she won't. 100% anti-gun.
@SenFeinstein Sen Fecal-stain...retire already.
@SenFeinstein #ImpeachObama already!! #muslims did it & that idiot wants to bring 10k more here? THEY ARE A THREAT!!
@SenFeinstein You know, from you, that takes gall.

.@SenFeinstein do you get that same feeling in the pit of your stomach each time you support an org that kills unborn children?
@SenFeinstein @SoCalBisonEsq Respectfully, that's not enough senator, this has gone too far. Where is safe? Where can one sit safely?
@SenFeinstein They were Muslims and you say nothing.  You ##^# coward
@SenFeinstein Americans need to educate themselves about workplace bulling, http://www.healthyworkplacebill.org/faq.php 
@SenFeinstein what I ask of you is to continue you're fight against ISIS & or work place bulling http://www.healthyworkplacebill.org/faq.php 
@SenFeinstein We don't need your heart. We need your action.
@SenFeinstein notice how the gunman went in there and found that they had no guns an open fire and did not throw down their weapons, stupid
@SenFeinstein @SenatorBoxer this is either work place violence and or Obama's #JVTeam! Something needs to be done about both! Do something
.@SenFeinstein we are all sickened by mass shootings, so please use your job to legislate change. Enough is enough #SanBernadino
@SenFeinstein We don't want condolences. We have more mass shootings than days this year.  #DomesticTerrorism #GOPkills
@SenFeinstein Who knew..Israel rejects 40 percent of its applications for a gun, the highest rate of rejection of any country in the world.
@SenFeinstein Thank you for your tweets, Senator. I wonder how many people today know of your deeply horrific experience with gun violence.
@SenFeinstein Please, senator, we need stronger gun controls at every level. These shootings cannot become the new normal. Thank you.
@SenFeinstein Hopefully action will be taken on gun control. I work in that area & our building was on lock down for part of the day. Tragic
@SenFeinstein what are you going to do as an elected official to create tougher gun laws?
@SenFeinstein Yet you're fine with mass killing of children in the womb.
@SenFeinstein  And yet you  are a member of Congress and do nothing about it
@SenFeinstein what will say if these cockroaches were muslims?
@SenFeinstein Gun regulation now.  #enoughisenough
@SenFeinstein Me too.  But you can do more than I in response.  Legislate like you feel!
@SenFeinstein We must act to stop this madness and keep those out of office that will not assist.
@SenFeinstein  I'm voting against every sitting politician that isn't backing meaningful gun reform when their next election comes around.
@SenFeinstein Again, we don't give a shit about your stomach. When will you DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
@SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein We know your experience is personal. Please continue to attempt change.
@SenFeinstein your sorrow is NOT enough anymore! Do something about it or voters should find somebody that can!
@windicornr voters will find someone else this is her last term she's a fool a stinking fool POS
@SenFeinstein This is domestic terrorism and we must be able to defend ourselves!
@SenFeinstein Thank you for your sincere, difficult, lonely efforts to restore common sense gun regulation. Hope you will continue.
@SenFeinstein we are on lockdown. Do something about assault guns.
@SenFeinstein DO SOMETHING!!!!!!! This level of violence is unacceptable
