@SenSchumer @CoryBooker unfortunately for all the race thirsty democrats there is no actual evidence of racism from Sessions
@pjbowles @JudiciaryDems @SenSchumer @CoryBooker What will Schumer do now that the Circus is closing its tent?
i would agree @CoryBooker  
the next one must see that justice is blind. unlike the last 2 atty gen who made it political
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker Lying for fame, selling your soul for 30.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker
LOL..the resemblance tho...lol
you mean he will actually do his job and not cover up criminal behavior. There are no pre-emptive pardons...
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker Sessions is not the one . He is definitely not going to defend us against police brutality.
@SenFeinstein @CoryBooker Booker stop encouraging "victim mode and living in the past" and encourage letting go & move 4ward
@SenFeinstein @CoryBooker why is letter from Coretta Scott King not added as official record? http://bit.ly/CorettaKing 
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker yep because Eric Holder & Loretta Lynch made a disaster. They took the country back to the 60s
Cory Booker, you should be ashamed. Step down now and never run for office again.
Booker lied. Testimony of several black colleagues proved: Session is a man of fairness & equality.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker really when Dems have caused more racism and hate than anyone.
How can people heal w/out affordable meds?
@auntbec15  @CoryBooker   Thank you for today's testimony #MySenator
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker it's not the job of AG to bring hope n healing its to uphold the law Obama ruined hope n change
fight the power. Agent Orange has rebirth the 60's  thanks for your creative destruction.
Who's last AG to do that @SenFeinstein? You supported Eric Holder and Loeretta Lynch, far from that standard! @JudiciaryDems  @CoryBooker
Next attorney general must bring truth + justice, and heal wounds caused by Democratic treachery.
@AfAmDemocrats have lost hope in the past 8 years under @POTUS @HillaryClinton in 'plantations'
.@CoryBooker - Will this take place on a Tarmac or a Jet?
Also, will it be handled #FastAndFurious ??
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker Having to "CORRECT" All of the Division that @barackobama @vj44 & @TheDemocrats Will Take Time!
so you think that DJT, Bannon, Sessions R best choices to heal the divide? B real!
as we all know @CoryBooker already demonstrate his ability to flip flop on issues after checking  his packed situation
#CivilRights..4All @CoryBookerAudit  
#VenturaCA #SanDiego  #Connecticut DueProcess ViosDiscrimination  Cash&CarryVerdicts
@JudiciaryDems
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker I'm confused. Didn't Obama just say race relations are best they've ever been? What's to heal?
Cory Booker 2020
This is the same Booker who said he respected Sessions. Now, he's all up in his grill. Hypocrite
Please remember the crooks you got into AG capacity during Obamass admin.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker 
You mean like these liars and criminals, corrupt us government
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker embarrassment
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker - I u Cory! Go and get him!!!! #imwithyou!
@SenFeinstein @CoryBooker because the last 2 did not.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker  Cory Booker is playing to the media for attention.  He's really a jackass.
Thank you for standing up to him!
have you all forgotten Holder and an airplane visit by Clinton in Arizona with Lynch? So dishonest
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker if your a black Democrat you spin the untrue, unfounded racism story. Session shut down KKK n state
- Law and order w/o justice is unattainable. Law & Order is not enough.
Strong and compassionate, well done Cory Booker!
yet Dimmocraps voted for Eric Holder, who did nothing but politicize the office
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker  Absolutely right Corey,  because the last 8 years only opened old  wounds and divisions
Well said, must bring hope & healing 2 our country. After the last 8 yrs it's long over due.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker If this liar is thr Dems future you're minority leader till death comes.
Lorrette lynch. Eric holder didn't ?
@SenSchumer All AG has to do is bring JUSTICE . Not pamper anyone . Enforce the laws . No political agenda
the next AG needs to enforce our laws... PERIOD.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker I hope to see a fair primary  election without dnc tipping the scales
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker Agreed!
unlike the last one has..the one who has clandestine mtgs in airport hangers with candidates husb?
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker What about the RULE OF LAW??? That's the AG job. @SenatorSessions will make a GREAT AG! #Trump #maga
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker Sen. Sessions won't  bring unity & healing to country everyone saw Trump rallies & heard things said
Yeah, Sessions has got a lot of work to do cleaning up BHO division for the past 8 years!!!
the Att Gen MUST PROTECT THE USA AND FOLLOW THE LAW!  You are reading from obamas script geez
@SenatorSessions he will do that.He will enforce our laws,and that's what you liberals are afraid of
obama could not due but Trump will .fake fact booker
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Can't wait for all the rallies Mr. Trump will hold on future Senators elections!#DTS
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker this man is racially motivated! Step down Booger!!!
somebody in the cabinet has to.  Right now the prospects out there are giving me agita.
That person is not @jeffsessions 
#StopSessions 
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @GOP @realDonaldTrump
@lanah03 @CoryBooker and he should probably be black, given most whites are still living in 1950 or something.
Thank You!  #StopSessions
Thank you Senator! I am a retired NJ (female) police officer...Thank you for breaking with Senate tradition!
Did the last "attorney general bring hope and healing to our country"? Black attorney general and president.
@irisbreeze @CoryBooker Bravo Sens Booker and Richmond Eloquent passionate on the money
What would your liberal ass know about that .You have set quite as Obama's DOJ did nothing to uphold the law POS
@RepRichmond @repjohnlewis  @Action2getherNJ    #BeCourageous
Gee! Sen Booker do you mean like AG Lynch? Along with @BarackObama has caused the wounds that needs healing
Anytime there is a scab, there is a unhealed wound. The scab pre-dates 2009 and 1961.
Trump has 20 nominees 4 Supreme Court Anyway 2 get info released asap Speed the process b4 summer?
@SenFeinstein @CoryBooker The next AG must enforce all laws as written by Congress. Also don't give guns to drug cartels.
very well put Senator Booker
