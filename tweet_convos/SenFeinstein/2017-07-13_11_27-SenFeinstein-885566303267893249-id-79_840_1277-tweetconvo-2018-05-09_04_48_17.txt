Why does government furnishe insurance
Have you read the Henry Kaiser Foundation Report? There is NO sign of market collapse.  It is all lies.
It is a Health care bill against women. Atrocious!!!!
Except fot the "bribes" Mitch threw at fence-sitters
For accessible text version of @SenFeinstein 's statement go to https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=E83D14CD-9BA0-4B97-B0F0-9C5EAE30F1C2 ….
In every way that matters, the Republican health care bill unveiled today is the same atrocious bill that couldn’t pass two weeks ago. 
Then for heavens sake REPEAL & REPLACE & stop wasting everyone's time
Next week the Senate is going to vote on legislation to save Americans from the ObamaCare DISASTER. #WeeklyAddress 
Do NOT confirm Wray. This is such a bad idea. They have Coats & Roger in their pocket.Do u want to give away all r IC,s?
And Stop the Graham/Cassidy "alternative"!
Make calls please
It was red lipstick ....a lot of it
Right, but @SenateMajLdr doesn't care because he only works for Donnie and his own big GOP masters.
Not understanding why #MedicareForAll is not introduced by SOMEONE in Washington. Economically feasible but alas, no money grab.
There's no way to give $billions to rich & have acceptable plan. GOP has strayed afar from constitutional mandate. Now they serve only rich.
You = hypocritical jerkass, now seeming to complain, in a tweet, how pubs spin, upon doomed ACA insurance churn, like dogs w/collusion toy.
@BunnerPatty 
GOP USING DISTRACTIONS OF TREASONOUS INCOMPETENTS  TO PUSH TRUMPS DEADLYCARE . ACA NEEDS RETOOLING NOT REPLACING
7 years of complaining and this is what they have?
@SenFeinstein Please reach across the aisle to Republican women who have not yet crossed over to the dark side. Please!
Single payer for CA
Did you actually read it this time?

But Republicans place a tutu on a pig.....and sell it to fools
Trump threatened Congress not to "dare leave" without getting this done. It's ridiculous to rush such an important bill through
As a person protected by the AHCA. I would not have gotten the surgeries I need without it  ; Please help keep it
REPEAL OBAMACARE 1st! NO SINGLE PAYER, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE PROGRAM, PRIVATIZE
Single Payer!
Thank you for fighting for us that will die if Trumpcare is passed
Booo GOP
No Diane, it is much worse. RE: Cruz amendment
How has Obamacare been working out for folks?  The GOP plan can't be worse than a plan that is mostly dead.
Explain why you are repealing ACA when there is 82% satisfaction?
Thank you for watching out for us all.
No on Trumpcare, no on Wray.
Only difference are concessions to hard-hearted base!
It's Garbage!
You own Obama Care, there are no Insurance Co. that will provide affordable Coverage. I encourage Republicans to step back, Dems can fix it.
It's worse, it has the Cruz Amendment
In a word, ma'am, reconciliation.
We don't need your help.
Take it out with the garbage.
Thank you Senator! Also, please vote NO for Wray. We DO NOT TRUST HIM.  Here are some of the reasons why: https://www.dcreport.org/2017/07/10/senators-to-consider-new-fbi-chief/ …
Thank you and @SenKamalaHarris 4 standing up 4 your constituents & all U.S. citizens. Proud to have you both as my Senators. #Resist
The Cruz amendment lets me choose what is best for me. I'm not forced to pay for a loaded plan full of stuff I don't need
3 shells hide equally-small peas. #Trumpcarekills
Keep up the fight Dianne,let our voices be heard! Mitch & the rest of Trumps bully boys don't care about us they just want to pass anything!
Why are you so sad angle?
This bill is awful! I'd still lose my insurance! I'm 61 & I need my health insurance. Please fight it!
Here's how the revised version of the Senate health care bill would affect you - No way! I'll lose my insurance. https://apple.news/AQg7GgprESEKnHs7tYs6J4w …
Sorry but democrats that passed Obamacare have no credibility when it comes to a new bill.
Agree
Senator Feinstein, You Rock!!  Thank you for speaking the truth!
Speaking about Obnoxious, when are you going to retire? Pretty good deal your husband got on the sale of Government realestate $$$$$$$$$$$$$
Can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
Here, try this new bill...
Not entirely the same because they keep the taxes? But terrible if people get bare bones insurance & pre-existing not covered & Medicaid bad
Congress swears on the Constitution to "promote the general welfare" of the nation. Obs, this doesn't even come close. TU for fighting.
Thank you for telling it like it is.  Atrocious.
Here's the problem,
You know Dems may never control the White House,  The House or The Senate again.

That's why you're throwing a hissy fit
Says a senator that only shows up in LA for a photo op at a hospital. #ACA #obamacare being funded by stolen private property @fanniemae
#GOPHealthcareIsMurder
Quit calling this health care, you're talking about health insurance
But your party passed an fiscally irresponsible bill. You're a hypocrite
Keep up the good work. Thank you.
Trumpcare SUCKS
Can't change a crappy bill into diamonds
Yah, but Hillary's emails
BENGHAZI! BENGHAZI!
Ageed. Atrocious because it's MORE like Obamacare now.
So block it, I dare you!!!
