AMEN! Also, REALLY concerned about Grassley & Graham's apparent attempts to DISCREDIT & derail the FBI investigation into trump/Russia!!!
Ya like the Terrible health bill you Dems passed in 2009 was so transparent. I GUESS WE WILL HAVE TO PASS IT TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE. Boy Howdy
...and your team is doing... What? Doubling down on gun control?
Federal judge blocks California ban on high-capacity magazines 
The WH bully wants to repeal w/ no replace. He and GOP are about to further abuse Americans.
I think there was plenty of failure to learn from with Obamacare.  No worries... just get your no vote ready and you'll be notified.
It's failure is due to Trump's sabotage - read the facts, sweetheart 
What happened to we will have to pass the bill to see what is in it  AND YOU PASSED IT transparent after the fact. What's good for the goose
I don't think the Republicans would do that considering they asked all Democrats to help them and you guys said no so.. Whose fault is that?
yes take Obamas lead
YOUR party said that you had to PASS OBAMACARE FIRST to know what was in it!  THAT is the ULTIMATE secrecy, you hypocrite!
Where was this position eight years ago, hypocrite?

You are obviously talking about your own failure. How about offering some constructive ideas and help instead of tearing everything down.
if Schumer was actually sincere on trying 2b a Senator 2 seek common ground we might have a chance U used 2b winds of reason blow No more
Wasn't it @NancyPelosi that said concerning the Obamacare bill,"We must pass it in order to know what is in it."???
They are destroying our government system they all need removed!
Is there any correlation with exchanges pulling out of states due to political pressure causing the appearance of the ACA failing?
At least they are #WORKING #MAGA
The GOP is a group of American Conservatives - me included and YES We Care about America..the Dems prefer refugees and criminals #MAGA
You certainly don't show it with your white supremacy & terrible grammar  #DipShit #GOPcoward #ShowYourFaceGlinda
"if Republicans would actually work to improve the law, our entire country would be better off.”
I worry what drives McConnell? Ryan-greed. Mitch-hatred and power? Do you think he is as nasty to his family? Coercive avoidance isnt right
Dianne would rather you pay high Health Care rates and outrageous deductibles than reach across the aisle and work something out.
So this is worse than Obama care when it couldn't be read until after it was passed and since has abysmally failed?
Start emphasizing how we can FIX the #ACA instead of just attackjng the AHCA  #MedicaidExpansion #HealthInsuranceForAll
This whole episode since January shows that EVERYTHING T advocates is about extending his evil empire
Well said, Senator.  Thank you.
Could you tell Chucky and Lindsey to sit the hell down and stop trying to interfere with the special counsel's investigation. #TrumpRussia
They conveniently seem to forget that!!!
How hypocritical of u WE THE AMERICAN PPL remeber the words "we must pass tbis bill to see what in it" so shut up retired ur a cancer
Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.
Ma'am what goes around comes around
Secret deals with republican holdouts. $$$$changing hands.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Don't be hypocritical. Remember this?
SENATOR HAVEN'T THEY LEARNED THEIR LESSON ;UNITE !AND WRITE A BILL TOGETHER ;BOTH DEMS ;AND GOP ;OR IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK!
They are taking their que from dem. Funny how dem crying now but said it was okay when they did it. Why people hate politicans.
You should probably be more concerned abt #CIA "working in secrecy". Are they still spying on you? Are you sure of that? No, right? We know.
Stop obstructing
Transparency.  Something completely missing from the Obama Democrat control for prior 8 years.   Please spare us the hypocrisy.
Ur great HC bill has brought me $30k/yr premiums. Guess u should of read it before u passed it. No lectures from u! Disgusting!
Isnt that just what Democrats did to obama care then ram it down our throats had to pass it to find out whats in it shut up
Let's see how did the Democrats inner deuce Obamacare when your colleague said you must voted it in to read it
Just as you bozos Ds did when you rammed thru Zero Care! Geez you gems have short/conveniet memories..
Exactly what the Democrats did!
Sounds familiar, isn't that what the Dems did with Obamacare?
Ur great leadership has brought us $20t in debt, failed education system, 11m illegals and ur lecturing who?
democrats caused healthcare problem. u passed a bill without knowing whats in it. Ur hypocrites, u act like U care about but really dont.
Thats becuase they are not fixing it; they are trying hard to find ways to bribe other senators to vote to gut Medicaid.  #Ryanswetdream
Interesting that you point out the EXACT process used by Obama to create the ACA
You mean like Obama/Pelosi transparency?
It's time for you and your fellow democratic senators to march over and demand to be a part of the negotiations!
They learned it from the Dems. when they did likewise with OBCARE !
The Democrats worked in secret on the Obamacare bill.  And many others.  So, what are you saying again?
Please don't talk about transparency. Obama admin lacked it worse than anyone and you never said a word. Hypocrisy
We have to pass the bill to see what's in it. Transparency!
We're in bizarro world led by @POTUS & @SenateMajLdr No secret bills by only old white men behind closed doors!
GOP FOLLOW Leninist Trump EXAMPLE  & doubling down
Why Wait? Improve ACA while they hide in their closet. bring new ACA to the floor..Act on behalf on Americans now.dont wait.
Thank you for fighting against this terrible bill AND the completely untransparent process!
People who live in glass houses!!
These men are pretty hard headed! Dont learn from past mistakes!
#fascistsictators
I find it hysterical that Dump abashes Dems for not participating when the GOP won't even let all the Reps participate.
And they think it would be terrible if they had to work with democrats to make the bill. Why would they feel like that, its great!!!
Take some time and call Kate's family and apologize for her murder in your sanctuary cities
The  math problem the GOP can only afford to lose 2 Senators the moderates on 1 side Collins, Heller & Murkowski cons.Paul , Cruz , Johnson
Keep fighting Senator Feinstein we are with ya
Pelosi said she even know what's inside of the bill for the ACA until after you guys voted for it.

 Was she the only one?
Gotta pass it to see what's in it.
GOP is not fooling anyone...we've seen their playbook B4 when "MILLIONS" are intentional harmed-> it's still going to be a BAD BILL!
transparency will expose them!
They brought out the worst version first as a trial balloon-to go back and revise the worst portions, making some think it's so much better.
How are the citizens of a  country with a representative government supposed to feel when this is happening secretly? Appalling
Dems did it, but no one criticized them...what's good for the goose....
Like you were transparent on Obamacare. #hypocrites
Good thing we already know what they are up too ...
Boo....
Cornhusker Kickback.
When will the American people get bipartisanship!? We deserve better!
Thank you for continuing to #RiseUp4HealthCare! Constituents like this NICU nurse & her firefighter husband are counting on you to fight.
Omg
Stubborn dumb old white men never learn!
Don't think of it as secrecy, think of it as a pvt board meeting to maximize senatorial profits. u can use what ever our result 2 fund raise
Let the Republicans have their secret meetings. The people of America will remember.
Hence the whole Donny tweet this morning- to distract public from McConnell and company's back room arm twisting and bribery!
Either you quit complaining and start standing for single payer or people are going to vote you out. Your voters see through the Bullshit.
Months of deliberation, tons of public hearings, many GOP amendments. There was transparency, you just refuse to acknowledge it.
Collaboration!
Mould only grows in the dark.
