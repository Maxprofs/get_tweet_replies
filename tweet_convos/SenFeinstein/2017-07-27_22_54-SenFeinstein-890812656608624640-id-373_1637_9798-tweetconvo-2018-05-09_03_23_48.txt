2 of my faxes were to McCain & Collins ~ I used @faxzero  - they let you fax all congressmen, senators, governor & AG Sessions FREE 
Bullshit!!! 3 GOP senators led the way to defeat that "terrible" bill. Calls and emails from Californians had shit to do with it...
Thank you for all your work
Thanks for staying strong on this, @SenFeinstein
Funny that you didn't listen to those "thousands and thousands" of calls to defeat the shitty ACA 7yrs ago. Thanks for raising our taxes.

Thank you Sen. Feinstein for all your support. We appreciate everything you've done for us. We're greatly indebted to you. Thank you. #Hero
She was doing awesome double-duty yesterday. Did you catch her interviewing Browder (I think his name was) with Grassley?
Yes I did. She was very well spoken and very professional. A+++
I was impressed by @ChuckGrassley too. So much came out, relating directly to #TrumpRussia, but no grandstanding or demonizing or politics.
I didn't see how well he performed. But I heard he did very well. Very well spoken and professional as well.
Terrible like? When ACA violated the CR of American Indians in non fed tribes for 6 years? That's a felony when's @CivilRights gonna 1/2
Prosecute you & the rest of @TheDemocrats or don't American Indians have same rights as everyone else? ACA discriminates against 500k ppl2/2
@POTUS needs to get @CivilRights to prosecute pgs 2006-09 of ACA "forgot" non fed tribes Sebelius directive non fed tribes must prove 1/3
"Indian enough" toCONTINUE to receive HC from IHS title 6 of Civil Rights act no fed$ can go to any program that uses race as a qualifier2/3
There are 500k ppl in non fed tribes 14 states have no fed recog tribes Obamacare is discriminatory to a minority group of 1st Americans 3/3
It's a choice the extermination of American Indians or the end of Obamacare & the racist @TheDemocrats that passed the discriminatory law
You are a crook! #PostofficerealestateDeals #HUD #ObamaCareIsNotHealthcare #HighDeductibles #100%PlusIncreaseInPremiums #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA
Proud to be from California - thank you

You need to jump on your state (Texas?) and tell them to FULLY implement the ACA. California has it and it rocks!
Thank you Senator

Thank you Senator!!
No, THANK YOU,
Dianne!!!
@IndivisibleEB Thank you Senator. It was touching to see McCain put his arm around you. Good friends, good colleges
No it didn't. CA does not play into the national landscape cuz it's so far left.
Geographically, that's true. Otherwise, that's just idiotic.
Stop the lies, nobody in America listens to what Leftist Antifa Californians want. More Sickle/hammer flags flying around in SF everyday.
If we could just convince you to support a progressive program like single payer...
Thank you. Now let's fight for single payer or public option.   I'm a Californian.  Paying premiums with no subsidy/deduction.
Thank YOU @SenFeinstein & @SenKamalaHarris! Hoping you are able to work across the aisle & fix #ACA.
Thank you!!!!
You are amazing! God Bless you!
