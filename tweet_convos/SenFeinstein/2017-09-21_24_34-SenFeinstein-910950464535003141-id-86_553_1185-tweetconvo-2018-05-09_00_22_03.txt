American people MUST be active. Get on the phones. Call Republican senators at 202-224-3121. #ProtectOurCare!!
Do you support single payer without insurance companies involved?
It's not about "better"; it's about destroying the progress of the first black president.  Call them on it.
Obama is bi- racial....
It doesn't matter what they do, your commitment to obstruct will always Drive your response.
Not as bad and horrendous as Obama care...
Well you built it why didn't u fix it?
At least they r trying!  Dems like Frankenfeinstein would rather sit back and let Obamacare implode!
Not true. They want to fix it but are getting no help from Republicans.
Really, exactly what proposals/bills have they introduced - bipartisan or otherwise?
I'd expect after Trump promised universal health care, that you'd hold him to it.
Don't let Congress take your health care. Take theirs. https://tinyurl.com/yasd3ofz   #BadCongressNoHealthcare!
Keep fighting, Senator! Signed, a long-time supporter in CA. From your SF supe days.
It's so bad they're telling @lisamurkowski that if she votes for it, Alaska can keep their #Obamacare
Kill it NOW
You'd expect out of all members of government that you'd GET OUT of trying to run everything!!!! #sorrysocialists
Biggest scam ever: Billionaires want to work for the common man. Hot doggie Doo Americans can't be so dumb to elect a cabinet of full?
If your mission is to deprive the max number of people from the healthcare they need, maybe it's the best? 
Why would I expect that? They clearly want to be as destructive as possible. #Resist
It's horrific
What are the merits of this bill?  Obviously it's about #DonorsoverVoters #GrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyBill #GrahamCassidyNO
How is giving healthcare spending decisions to state legislatures worse than giving decisions to insurance companies who protect profits?
This is #RedState #Welfare
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Where is your outrage with Samantha Powers unmasking everyday on the job ??? OBama WH corrupt stop this now !!
That's why all should be scrapped.  Just repeal the whole thing.
Why would we expect improvement from the @GOP? Just look at their idea of a 21st century @POTUS. Dubya, then Trump. #DumbAndDumber

This must be serious. You,'re actually tweeting.
I'd expect you to be willing to work with Republicans to correct the failing ACA instead of just obstructing everything they try to improve.
Perhaps because it is factually a tax cut; not a health care bill.
Gee if they just had another 7 or 8 years they might come up with a plan that doesn't kill everyone
Nothing is worse the the atrocity you all came up with...The unaffordable care act!
Every time, they get stingier. I think the #resistance is making them mad. Is it retribution?
it's much better and way way way better that Obamacare.
let states run things like they want!
you in Washington are disconnected.
They've had 7 years....tells ya what their priorities are
This tweet is even better if you imagine Jean Ralphio saying it. #theworst
How's your HC Senator?  If you cared about us you would have given us the same thing you got in  Obamacare.  You hypocritic
I normally dont agree with you. But they have had 7 years to work out a better idea. They keep rushing bills that dont make sence.
What's your excuse 4 Obamacare? Talk about a federal train wreck! U won't vote 4 a Republican bill if everything is FREE! No common sense!
You are the worst. I hope this one passes just to teach tou jerks should have voted for the first REPEAL NOW.
How@about fix the ACA instead ?
Thought Obamacare was
Desperate...thus despicable....
It is insane what they are trying to do to the nation! We are FED UP!
Thank you so much for fighting for ACA. You and @SenKamalaHarris have my support. And yes, I've called several times.
Hey Dianne give it a rest before you stick your foot in your mouth. I wish all you senators &Reps who are against everything go on Obamacare
@fccmal ....Worse is better when it comes to Republicans.
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, ARE YOU GOING TO BE ON SAME INS AS THE REST OF US... BE TRUTHFUL.. ?
Please retire and go away.
Nothing is worse than a progressive agenda and a chip-on-her-shoulder senator.
We were $3 trillion in debt the day you were elected - $20 trillion now. I'd use "worst" very carefully.
The KILLER OF ALL OF US EVEN CONGRESS MEMBERS AND THEIR OWN FAMILIES WHEN THEY THEMSELVES R NO LONGER IN OFFICE!!! 
THINK AHEAD GOP; THINK
If it only were actually about healthcare - but we all know this is just about @GOP donor bribes and tax cuts.
Trump doesn't care what's in the bill, he just wants to get it done and take a credit for it
How about we get government out of healthcare? Everything the government touches becomes garbage due to crony capitalism.
You want the government to abandon Medicare?
Medicare for SS recipients makes sense.
Maybe they should wait till midnight on Christmas to try and pass something.

I never expected them to do right by their constituents because they just DON'T.
Its the Sibylline Books of legislation. Each offer gets worse. Senate needs to not to buy, even though they know the next will be even worse
Drafted by the two most dishonest GOP, #GrahamCassidy, the devils & Trump, the Lucifer.
You are Lucifer.
They caved to the extremists to get support.
4th? Try over seventy times to repeal the ACA. This isn't an attempt at "health care". It is a tax program and a scam.
Isn't there a three-strikes law somewhere on the books?
Democrats or to be thankful that the GOP is trying to bail them out of Obama care. It's a disaster
So does that mean we are no longer in threat of it passing?
Why do you hate Catholics?

#CassidyGraham #GrahamCassidyBill #JimmyKimmelTest #JimmyKimmel #GOP #healthcare #preexistingconditions #cartoon @jimmykimmel @BillCassidy 
Still better than Obamacare

YOUR @GOP #DeathCare !
Atrocious.
Weird that my children could die because one of our elected representatives was paid millions to kill their health coverage for profit.
