Build that wall!
Thank you, Senator Feinstein. This seems like a common sense approach to premiums. It would certainly help me and my family.
Sen Feinstein, do you see what the GOP is trying to do now? Repeal ACA and that's it? We must not let them run this crap on us. Disgusting
Maggie great idea to Repeal ACA. Only Why to get democrats to the table.
That is wrong. Democrats wanted a bi partisan bill. Democrats will work with republicans.  its the other way around.
Maggie their is no way in hell that the democrats want to work with republicans on ACA. It's their way or no way. Listen to Feinstein.

North Korea launched a new type of missile, Pentagon says: http://on.msnbc.com/2tqEvwN  
You do know there's almost no middle class now, don't you? 1/2 of Americans live in poverty! We don't want profit-driven healthcare!!!
Let me know when you are on ACA.
Doubt it. A liberal rag supporting a liberal hag

@geoff9cow @SenFeinstein @kitty4hawks @sfchronicle Absolutely it does.
Won't happen.
@GOP here's your bill to fix healthcare #trumpcaresunamerican
Get out of health care and stop overtaxing us, then we can afford insurance.
Hahahaha!

How many years have you had s chance to do this Sen. Feinstein?
Nothing about the expansion of Medicare during Obama years that the federal government subsidized to states and made them dependent on it.
Thank you for writing an alternative!
Obamacare rates are sky rocketing. 83 insurance companies are out of the business. People can't afford the deductible. What is wrong?
And let's not forget the majority who are working class and poor. Tax credits don't help us!
R U an accuary?
Another give away program? Will the rest of us pay for other people's insurance? Since OCare put in our deductible is up 130% & premium 120%
So you all think single payer is the right plan for all of us. But you want someone else to pay for it.
Of course... Dianne ! Democratic SF chronicle liberal bias corrupt fraud news media would !! Deal with your sanctuary city !!
Insurance is too expensive for EVEN those who can afford it. Add your names to HR 676. Support CA efforts in moving away from this model.
If only the @GOP would listen. Sigh.
More affordable? Is the government involved? I'll pass.
I had affordable insurance until the ACA was passed, I lost my plan and my doctor and was lied to and told I wouldn't lose it! Thanks Dems
Capping premiums will be DOA. Why not propose at LEAST a #PublicOption which would push rates down organically? #Spineless #Dems
I am a member of the middle class and don't need "insurance [that is] more affordable" I need #MedicareForAll
It's a miracle! @sfchronicle reporting something other than the new macrame knot exhibit in the mission.
Thank you California senators
Not good enough; We want single payer! #SB562

@SenFeinstein Time for you to get on board with single payer or #retire.

How much insurance  have you taken?  They have bought you. Sad!
You are not listening. Nothing to reinvent!! It is called MEDICARE FOR ALL!  Duh!!!!!!
The two of you are inspiring leaders!  Thank you.
Please help! We are all being choked out by insurance
Thank you both!  Praying we will be successful!!
How come Fox News is silent on #trumpcare? Could it be all their viewers will lose health coverage?
Love you but we need a public option! We need SB562 single payer.
Single payer
Please, what is Schumer's compromise. Not a word of it on dem mouthpiece TV networks. What is the SB number of you/Harris proposed?
If San Fran Outlet put it out, don't bother reading. Grew up in Bay Area
get the government out of healthcare, less regulations and more private sector involvement
@SenateGOP @SenateDems 
Citizens want freedom 
from fedgovt overcontrol.
Get fedgovt out of healthcare!
Repeal Obamacare DON'T REPLACE!
Citizens want profit driven insurance companies out of the health care system! #SinglePayer now! Fixed your typo for you Kathy!
Come on Senator a couple making over 80 THOUSAND $$$s a year can't afford to buy health insurance. That is pure BULL *#%&
Senator, the American people have made it abundantly clear we DON'T want insurance. We DO want single payer #MedicareForAll.
A little late senator.Where were you proposing bills during obamacare?Now that you see it sucks and you have no power,you want to propose it
How come congress isn't on obamacare, easy it's aweful
Medicare for all! Medicare for all! Medicare for all! Medicare for all! Medicare for all! Medicare for all! It works, people know/like it.
Jef I am on Medicare. I pay $335 per month I pay BS $109.30. I pay 51% of drug costs over $5,000. This to help others on Medicare now.
Please fight for the Medicaid Buy In option #Resistance #Persist
Insurance for the middle class used to be great. Now it sucks.  You think you've done a great job.  What in the hell are you thinking?
Maybe u should have thought of that when u democrats passed the mandated tax on everyone
Thanks for fighting the good fight on behalf of your constituents. #TrumpCare must not pass!
you had your chance.  You voted to increase it.  Now sit down and shut up
And who's paying for the illegals and the lazy people?
you 2 are great
Single Payer now.  No more handouts to your insurance lobbyist masters.
WE DEMAND HEALTH INDUSTRY COST CAPS AND EITHER SINGLE PAYER OR MEDICARE/MEDICAID FOR ALL NOW!  NO MORE WINE DINE POCKET LINE CORRUPTION!
TY Sen.Feinstein. Perhaps Ds cld plc.some vry serious focus on these issues as well. http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-gops-stealth-war-against-voters-w435890 … https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/kris-kobach-king-voter-suppression-will-lead-trumps-sham-voter-fraud-commission-be … @FBI
Why are we still talking about insurance? Your constituents want Health Care!
A BIG Thank You (from a fellow Californian) for your leadership on affordable, common-sense health care solutions! Thank you!
Thank you for trying to solve this problem. How about govt and private Insur like in Germany?
22M people will lose their insurance. Who's paying to make it more affordable? What's the deductible? Pre existing conditions aren't covered

Great now condense it in soundbites/talking points and go sell it to trumpfolk in trumpland before its too late
Grateful to you Senator, keep fighting for us

My employer has no right to be in my health care the american people should be a group and insist on single payer
Awesome
Wooohooo THANK YOU,
It's nice of you to try, but it's unlikely you'll find Republicans willing. If there's anything to learn from Trump: it's better to be bold.
SENATOR YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BILL AND WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GOP! SO YOU CAN ADD TO IT!
Single Payer please.
Karl Marx-Vladimir Lenin-Saul Alinsky all favored Socialized Medicine ran by govt to control the masses for their personal gain.
So more half-measures to avoid upsetting your health industry donors? Not surprising. I'm for #SinglePayer. See you in 2018!
Can you introduce legislation making it a FELONY for a US Congress person , Senator , or our President to KNOWINGLY lie to  US citizens?
Yes she can. From her jail cell.
Nothing to reinvent!! It is called MEDICARE FOR ALL!  Duh!!!!!!
Medicare isn't free you know? Prescription coverage sucks, no dental, vision. Huge copay in many instances.
Thank you! More than any other member of Congress, or the WH for that matter, I trust you!!!
President Trump' is trying to do just that by getting rid of Obama care
so when does getting rid of the affordable care act denying 22m americans of subsidized healthcare means trump is improving things

Social Medicine in any form is dangerous, just like the radical agenda of the Progressive Marxist Democrats-Past 100 yrs killed 120+ million
No, not true. My daughter lives in Germany and has great medical care. You choose govt Insur or private Insur.
1/ So simple, so obvious... unfortunately it costs money. R's are intent on cutting Medicaid/Cal,creating hi risk pools and cutting taxes
2/ for the rich. ANYTHING short of cutting the feds healthcare $'s is a non-starter for R's. Americans need the feds help BECAUSE
3/ HealthCare IS expensive, and simply beyond the reach of most Americans. To reduce the rate of increase 1 single payer, 2 preventive
4/ services, 3 cap malpractice awards/assist Dr.s /Hospitals with malpractice insurance, 4 standardize Negotiate Rx costs, or
5/ collect a royalty on behalf of the American people on all medical and pharmaceutical patents...
6/ patents/monopolies were created by the king to generate revenue for the royal coffers, now it simply gives Co's a license to print money.
Wrestling video = brutal violence

Shakespeare in the park killing president = art.

@CNN = grocery store tabloid
That would be wonderful if it passed
You have a death wish with Middle America to link yourself to KH.
Makes sense...but then again women usually do
Yes, Thank you for working so hard for us. I appreciate both your efforts. Puts a Smile on my face. Good luck!
Thank you
Thank you senator for focusing on solutions for the people instead of tearing it down and giving Healthcare CEO's & the .1% even more
Last time you said that about my healthcare cost, I got a Obamacare enema up my butt
Your bill was the ACA and it failed.  Now you want to put through another?  Thanks......but no thanks!!
Two words: Single Payer
Democrats are Isis
