(2/3) Join me and @SenKamalaHarris: We’re telling the Trump administration NO on opening up CA marine sanctuaries. https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=A27DAB55-3C2E-4E4C-90F3-EC25D040EE18 …
(3/3) Monterey Bay Sanctuary is home to beautiful kelp forests and vast deep-water canyons. Let’s keep it protected! @MBNMS
How do we help you?
We need to MOBILIZE...THEY ARE BEGGING US TO MOBLIZE & FOR HEALTHCARE #WeAreTheMajority 
Let's do this!
YES!!!  these REPUBLICANS BRAINWASHING the AMERICAN PEOPLE.. #WeThePeople HAD #ENOUGH 
California currently has offshore oil drilling platforms in state and federal waters. You could have stopped them, but they're Donors!
we have managed to hold of on building new platforms in last years. Be part of the solution
I've opposed offshore oil drilling since I was a toddler. 
1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill ended any new offshore drilling in CA #FactsMatter
Yes, but there are currently 9 platforms operating in state waters, and 23 in federal waters. Democrats didn't shut them down when in power.
Well they are being opposed now, and thank you for caring (no sarcasm or snark intended)
No, they aren't. Democrats in the state Legislature are not doing anything about offshore drilling in state waters. You're welcome, BTW. 
I've been diving in those sanctuaries; before they opened, no fish. Now they're rebounding and that's needed, enough exploitation for greed!
WELL SOF !!!!!

Except @Govjerrybrown didn't raise my taxes but has still solved years of @GOP deficits in CA, now has a surplus with great services too
This is a mere 20 min drive South of where I live , 
Remember ?
My daughter bought a very nice house in Oklahoma City for $250,000. I'm sure you would be so happy there and pay less taxes.
Only problem with OK is that it's become a failed state thanks to Republican Fiscal Irresponsibility, will take years to recover
Well the guy my tweet was a response to is angry about taxes so Oklahoma is a good place for HIM, not for me. I love California.
I love Northern Calif ,
Grew up & retired here ,
After Taxes ;
Before you condemned it let's find out all the facts
Dont let this happen!
The damage Deplorable Donald's doing to our country, the flora & fauna of God's Earth, AND the people Jesus said to take care of is - SICK!
You're in the Senate! Put forward offshore drilling legislation by Mar-a-Lago and all of Trump's beachfront country clubs.
Punch him in the wallet!
Senator, We can't continue to allow the GOP to degrade our democratic process or to allow the Crooked Trump family to be paid to play.
I thank you for all your efforts, and pray for a speedy resolution before Trump causes WWIII.
Do republicans wholeheartedly agree with this path of destruction or has fear of losing a vote come to mean more? How do we stop him Diane?
Stop this please!!! Omg! Trump has to go!! They are reserves to protect not exploit!!!!
Won't effect anything. Where is our water from Prop 1?
There is going to be nothing left by time he's gone.
We won't let that happen!
And what are WE supposed to do about it!! So far WE have not been able to do anything to rid us of this demented psycho!!!!
Impeach impeach impeach
Drill, drill, drill
Of course he will do that. CA and its people are Second most hated by Trump after Obama. He has destroyed everything Obama did next is CA.
No we can't let this happen
Look you are old and need to retire. Drug prices-you voted against SenSanders bill. That is forever stuck in my mind. #medicare4all or leave
Sanders drug bill didn't address the underlying problems is why so many thoughtful Progressive rejected it
And too many take WAY too much money from pharma. The bugs could have been worked out but campaign donations.....
Bernie's whole approach was a bug, he only wanted imports not address why Medicare must be able to negotiate here in USA
It was a start. How much does @SenFeinstein get from pharma for campaign contributions? A lot.
Nothing
Democrats are a dying breed, lucky for America because they are also the most stupidest,  America says vote you out of government
How tragic for trump supporters not clear minded enough to voice disapproval? Who wants a country surrounded by yhuge oil slick?
Off course not oil slick beaches we are not prepared for !
Thank you for fighting against this!
We should start charging oil severence taxes in California
It's all about the #benjamins. I can't trust either side of the aisle on this matter. Popularity race for votes. Not based on sincerity.

Absolutely NOT! Take him to court.
@realDonalTrump hates us. He hates Obama. He loves money. Not my president, ever!
This must be stopped! He can't control our state! Period!
Yes we can 
If Trmp is all about giving states more rights, can you pass legislation protecting the sanctuaries. #dumpontrump
The GOP fascist gov is backed by some of the richest ppl in the world and GOD!
Why?
Dumb Democrats on a witch hunt!. Must be the air in San Francisco.  Henny Peeny effect.
It´s like I say. Trump has to go! The quicker the better
DI Fi, the San Francisco treat. Put millions out of work to save the delta smelt. Liberal fool at best.
He just keeps sprinkling doom all over the planet.
@wendydshaffer He's nuts
wtf, can't these people be stopped. our children and grandchildren will only have pictures of how the world was.
So much for the gops fake love of "states rights."
Not surprised angry disturbed worried
Oh my God! He is a madman.
I fear we're settling into new comfort zone of boycotts, tweets & calls storms, street protests while waiting for 2018 like it's cavalry.
We've got 2 take high ground, own the initiative. We can't keep reacting bc they've got near-infinite supply of time-release shocks, horrors
Please fight this. We are with you! #ProtectCAMarineSanctuaries
What can we do to stop this?
#FeelTheBern
How are "we" going to stop it when both the GOP and Dems are in bed with big oil?
I know. Wish we could pinch ourselves and wake up!
Then don't let it happen! We r done w NOT being represented. Done w the destruction of nation by these criminals.
Dianne my name is Kathleen Steele, Ca. Resident, I object to the above & also to the health care bill being drawn up in secrecy/thats so bad
And right now we don't need additional oil drilling to occur-gas prices are moderate.
OH hell, no! This is California, not West Virginia...if he thinks he has seen protests...
Yes open them up! #MAGA wins!
WE ain't opening up shit!! Tell him @FrankieBur how we do it in Cali
We can't let that happen!
What can we do about this unfettered delivery of the #environment to #bigoil? Scary and sickening!
Oh but we can. Just tell them what the fine will be per gallon of oil spilled.
when Feinkenstein is whining whining whining, I know we are winning winning winning
@HillbillyinLA I don't think Gov Brown will push CA into any shady  CA 1of USA top GDP --Trump can't push CA into anything
Diane spend some of you and your husbands billions and FIGHT instead of wussing on US...
How can we stop it? So far u banch loosing the election. Any other way?
This us were states rights should mean something the people of the effective states should be able to vote on this
Dianne you just don't get it and never will.  SAD
He is doing this for revenge. CA should stop paying taxes.
Also the coast of NC!
Does he do anything and everything just to piss ppl off?
Just like Hillary, right, Green Party? We're so screwed.
All about oil $$$ for tRump and Russia
Agreed, but nothing has stopped him yet.  Why will this be different?
HOLY CRAP!!
I need to go see a dr. I can't take anymore..it's a new disaster every day. Very depressing #AbuseOfPower maybe pass AHCA C if ppl see then!
***GET A DAMN MESSAGE*** U can't stop this so GO AROUND. Start **TRUMPCARE SANCTUARIES**all STs & raise $$ 4 meds & food 4 PPL. SHOW not Cry
Guard your borders. After all, " states rights" work both ways.
@LBLawrence17 U need to tell us what u know about the Trump Russia investigation. This is getting scary
This is crazy! What is wrong with that idiot? Get him out already!
Please don't let it happen. Please
Oh sh*t !  No Way !!! Sen Feinstein,  please keep resisting this stuff  Our oceans cannot take this . We want no more of this!!!
Thank you for your opposition to this ludicrous and unnecessary action.
Then WORK HARDER ON IMPEACHING HIS ASS  thank you
We can't impeach unless we flip house to Dem in '18, GOP has shown they have no morals & are all complicit in the extreme grifting of gov $$
True I was just venting yesterday was extremely exhausting for my old bones
Its really scary right now.Ossof lost in GA & we all kno y, same narrow margin as last time. How can we have democracy w/faulty machines?
Nooooooo!!! Stop him
ANIMALS MEAN NOTHING TO TRUMP.
Will this nightmare EVER END?????
Even this, too, shall pass.

I pray that we don't, as well.
@SharronSmiley trump is destroying everything
#ImpeachTrumpNow b4 he does more damage to our country, our air, our water
OUR #EARTH
Absolutely no to this! That is my home.
thank you. Stop drilling!
Fight!!
The damage that *45 and the Republican agenda do will only continue to raise consciousness and opposition creating a blue tidal wave in 2018
I'll never forget the energy that was present in the Women's March.  It wasn't just a flash in a pan.  It was life-changing for so many.
Exactly! DJT can take his EO and shove it! Protect ALL of California from DJT.
There gonna be more than drilling to worry about if you do not stop this man.
He calls himself a builder but all he does is destroy.
Yes, please protect those sanctuaries.  They are priceless
So what are you going to do about it ?
We can't... but, HE CAN!!!!
You lost all credibility when you told your people that your desires come before theirs. "I don't want single payer." U no longer matter.
If trump wants a fight...he'll get a fight from California!
NO WAY IN HELL!!!
We WON'T LET IT HAPPEN, HE HATES CALIFORNIA AND OUR PPL
How else is this IGNORANT buffoon going to ruin our planet. He wants money and lots of it. He made a deal with the devil.
NO, don't let that happen!!
How about no executive orders while congressional investigations are continuing? Seems only logical.
Monterey Bay????
I'm so psychic lol
We already know from his sons they do not care about living things or the environment.He hates Californians and we hate him! #NoDrillingCA
Is this really happen 
He can just do whatever he wants.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE
This douchebag just keeps reaching lower and lower
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING OUR WILDLIFE ;AND CUTTING DOWN ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION!   THE DEMAND HAS DEMINISHED ;WHAT PURPO
This from the same guy that thought the electrical generating windmills in there Coachella Valley looked so bad?  Such a NIMBY attitude!

Fight em all the way! Flotillas!!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
The hits keep coming
Can California stop it?
He is taking his hatred of dems out on us. He is a danger to this country and needs to be incarcerated asap!!! #JailTrump #impeachtrump
Let's make human barricades.
Please fight!!!! Thank you for your efforts!!!
If its for the overall good of the country.
It should be decided by experts rather than emotional politicians or special interest.
Agreed?
Sanctuaries is too big a word for Mr. Bigshot to understand.
CA has been resisting offshore drilling for many years.  Open up solar and wind fields instead. Alternative energy, NOT OIL!
@SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris please stop Trump!  I'm so glad we have both of you fighting Trumps dangerous agenda!!!
Drill baby drill!
Help!
Sent you a fax of support on this issue
You can close the sanctuaries when we do away with gas. Otherwise they open for drilling. Dianne also Stop the WEP tax. You're killing me.
Stop Trump and his minions! #StopTrump #StandWithBearsEars
trump hates california
The feeling is mutual
Idiot
Sorry it took something close to home to get you on board. No reserve, monument or park in US should be subject to privatization. Period.
My God, will his greed never find boundaries? Ends whale protections & adds extraction for added risk.
Take him to court on Constitutional law of separation of state rights based on local needs.
Don't ask what @SenFeinstein will do for California. What will YOU do for California? I'll start. Anything, including #FreeCalifornia
FYI... http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/ …
FYI #FreeCalifornia is NOT #CalExit
different leadership and vision
and btw no foreign residents allowed

http://CaliforniaFreedomCoalition.com 
Where in the h*** did u get that? U know all applications will be evaluated for environmental impact. Does ur base believe because u said?
This is the kind of issue that can make #FreeCalifornia a reality. Defend California.
You are preaching to the choir, Senator. We are more powerless than you! This stinks and the system is broken when secret bills are passed.
Great.  Grab that cash and make a stash.  To hell with the earth right.  Maga..uhhmm. Yeah, yeah.
Do what you can to stop him
Everyday there's some horrible threat by this administration.  This would cause disastrous set-backs to the many years of restoration. NO!
Money money money
Thank God for you & your Dem colleagues!
45 also wants to allow seismic testing off the east coast. So many big issues spread all over the country. 
He's not going to be happy until he ruins everything. Trump must be stopped
WHAT WILL THESE MONSTERS STOOP TO NEXT??
Is there no limit to their greed? Thank you for fighting for us, Senator!
We must stop this - The event in the gulf is proof enough this is not good.
trump is raiding and cashing out our assets to reward his wealthy friends..just like Putin did in Russia. 
This must stop!

#ImpeachTrump
@MiamiPapers @SenFeinstein   He going to be sure he grabs all the money before 2018 elections
I see another Federal Court Injunction in the works. Sue the bastard Dianne!
Abso-positivo-lutely.
They are sanctuaries for a reason.  This idiot needs to stop!  Get him out of office!  Being an outsider is not the same as being ignorant!
Let's destroy us for oil and big business.  Asbestos blankets for all.  Free!  It's in the ACHA.  Didn't you see?  Best GOP plan ever. $$$$$
yikes!
Explain to us why this pos can do whatever he wants just by signing an "executive order".
Trump has already proven he doesn't care about things like sanctuaries and national monuments.
The gop hates those things too that is why they tolerate what he is doing to the long term prospects of their dying movement.
That makes no sense to me. They are American Citizens how can they not care. Not to mention the tourist dollars things like monuments bring
Can someone explain how an EO would be legally okay? How do EOs give a pres this much authority?
Trump needs to keep his filthy hands off of California! #CalExit
How do we stop it. He is in this for big business not for the people of America!
U know any #senators to stop him?
Why not home grow jobs?
U r all supposed 2 B representing us.His own admin can't control him!The people,& ur co-workers put a tyrant in power ! Damn right HELP
Why is it that every senator on both sides seem washed up w/o ideas. It's time to move on TERM LIMIITS
Weren't they only named "sanctuaries" to prevent drilling?  What do these "sanctuaries" protect? Are they protecting Russia's oil exports?
We to impeach Trump!
By all means let's stop efforts for US energy independence let's just continue to pay American dollars to Middle East Countries that hate us
Energy independence is best without oil
we are not going to become fossil fuel independent overnight makes no sense not continually exploring while continuing to explore other ways
That's true but we are getting passed by other countries & our economy will suffer 4 it
New wells won't stop if we transition 2 green energy
Transition is the key element, if you aren't well developed enough to transition when back up supply's are needed then you can't transition
I agree but in my opinion we shouldn't drill in the ocean.
It has been proven to be unsafe
How much more harm will Americans or congress stand for?  .@realDonaldTrump 's toddler-esque idiocy is tanking democracy and USA. #resign
I'm with ya sista ... that was my sentiment when obama effectively legalized 11 million illegal aliens.
He hasn't had ONE ORIGINAL THOUGHT NOT ONE 
Doesn't California have its own environmental regulations in place?
I honestly would like to know how states maintain their sovereignty over their own resources.
I'm not sure how far off the coast a states jurisdiction extends.
Yeah, well, I know what DT can do with executive order.
Can congress do anything about it?
