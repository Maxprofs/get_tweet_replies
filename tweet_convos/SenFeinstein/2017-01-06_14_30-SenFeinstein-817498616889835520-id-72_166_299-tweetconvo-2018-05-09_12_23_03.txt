(2/3) Russia must be held accountable. The issue shouldn’t be politicized—all Americans should be outraged at Russia’s actions.
(3/3) Read more about our bill to establish an independent commission to investigate Russian hacking:
Good they said that Hillary did this and I believe it. What about her emails?
You can't hack 50,000 emails. The only way to do it is by physical copying and leaking it - stealing in other words.
.@SenFeinstein Too little too late. Dems have been disgracefully AWOL as we enter 9th Gate of Hell together. Could've, would've, should've!
Trump is a traitor. He believes Putin over our own intelligence. Please don't allow him near the White House!
pls keep up the pressure on this. Dt Russian ties are NOT good for USA,
Thank you, Senator Feinstein. So Proud you are my senator. Please ensure no nominations go forward w/o vetting. #indivisible
Thank you for working on this very important issue! I think this is needed so that we can have confidence in our elections.
"AT THIS POINT, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE"?
Oppose Sessions nom for AG.  He is racist, anti-immigration, and LGBTQ.  America deserves better.
why don't yall investigate US citizen hacking and get to the bottom of the monitoring of US citizens? Cuz we pissed and GAF!
Thank you!
Sessions is racist, anti-immigrant, sexist, & anti-LGBTQ. Oppose his nom for AG & demand better for the US! #StopSessions
Thanks to the CIA, FBI & NSA, Russia Today can count on continued, likely expanded, Kremlin funding
PLS HELP ME 925-378-9245 @WCPChiefChaplin #BlueLivesMatter @FBINewYork @FBISaltLakeCity  @MaryCalviTV @realDonaldTrump @hulu
@realDonaldTrump @hulu @jvanderbeken @MaryCalviTV WHERE ARE MY CONSTITUTE SERVICES @FBINewYork @SecretService @USSenateUpdate
This needs to have watergate like actions and consequences
Thank you for conducting a responsible investigation. It is what should be occurring. #DTS http://grandmathunder.com/2016/09/understanding-global/@SenFeinstein …
We MUST not give in. Your California constituents support you all the way. @KamalaHarris
it's not just hacking - that's a small part - disinformation propaganda machine connections is what needs examination
investigate Obama's meddling in Isreal election also.
We're not dumb Senator. How dare you play politics w/ your constituents!
Repubs will never stand for an independent select committee w/ subpoena pwr and you know it. Ur just covering your rich ass
You said Mitch McConnell is a true patriot. All of you but a few are millionaire career polls who feed from the same trough
All of you are in the same club. You love McConnell and his wife so u won't push.  Maxine Watters only true people's voice!
AGREE
THIS SEC OF STATE DOG REX HAS OWNED PROPERTY IN RUSSIA, DO NOT LET FAST ONES BE PULLED ON AMERICA
Can you also confirm the investigations will look into determining if anyone in the US had advance knowledge or aided?
TRUMP IS A DRAFT DODGER AND HE AND SNOWDEN HAVE COMMITTED TREASON, BOTH MUST FACE THE LAW
|| Why do we need one? Our intelligence agencies have reported, haven't they? As we attack, we should also defend, right? #CIA
why didn't you object?
yeah
Thank you so much!
@samfbiddle @KatrinaNation It's just Sad that it's more important to investigate and prosecute whistle-blowers.
quit wasting money!!! u would be better serving us if you were working on instituting term limits for senate/house! #makeitso
While I totally appreciate this, does it really take a bill to open an investigation on acts of war?
The rule of law must apply equally, not selectively. Obama must be investigated for interfereing in Israeli election!
Let's have an independent commission investigate Obama sending operatives to Israel to influence election at cost of $350,000!
Thank you, Senator.
While you are at it find out how we tried to defeat Bibi last time he ran.
More waste of taxpayers money!
In the meantime, can you squash his presidency?
You are inciting war a Federal Offense Sen Feinstein 
 18 U.S. Code § 2385 - Advocating overthrow of Government
TREASON!
How did the Electoral College & Senate accept the results? I am so dismayed at the system.
@Lee_in_Iowa another Senator that didn't stand up for the country today. Shame! The next election will reflect your failure.
@LouDobbs Umm... where's your proof? Did Russia force @johnpodesta to make his password the word PASSWORD? Bahaha 
He lost phones

Calling @SenFeinstein 202-224-3841. Telling her to forget about getting my vote in 2018. Dem senators didn't even try.
I wish you'd had the backbone to oppose certifying the election results.
you need to get over it and do something productive
is this a joke? what about the NSA Mrs. Feinstein? No more unnescesary agression! no more amerikan weappons in europe. no more
We are outraged. We want further investigations and we want action taken against any and all involved-including Trump et al
@KamalaHarris Seriously, you are starting to lose your party. Many Dems feel ignored. Why didn't you sign?
we must investigate Russian hacks.  Not acknowledging this threat will impact the U.S. for years. We stand with you!
@iwanttolearn   You did not object to EC vote WTF?
Please keep fighting for this-we need you guys
THANK YOU Stand firm!!  GOP is more iron willed than Dems.. GO AFTER IT!
investigate #usa hacking of elections world wide too while your at it #corruption #nwo
Feinstein is a poster child for term limits - retroactive term limits
due to the hacking we need a new election.
