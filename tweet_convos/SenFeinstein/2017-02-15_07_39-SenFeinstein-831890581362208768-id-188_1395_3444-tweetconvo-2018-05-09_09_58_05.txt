@SenSchumer It's appalling that Democrats don't realize that not 1 illegal gun will be impacted. Legal owners rarely murder.
It's appalling that Democrats are always wanting to restrict Constitutional Rights for no clear reason.
it was a response to #sandyhook unanimously passed by congress, signed by Bush.
suspect at best. I lean toward a created crisis manufactured 2 push an agenda/narrativ
Feel good crap they passed to ease their own guilt...not one shooting prevented.
you haven't any idea how many shootings were prevented. If you want to prevent shootings AUS model best
So move there.
I prefer to stay here and joust with no nothing ideologues such as yourself
@SenSchumer again you fail the people. Criminals don't care about law no matter who signs them.Poor prosecution is the problem
easy to throw stones - she's not failed anyone she's one of the senates hardest workers
arguing against the 2nd amendment or any part of the constitution is failing the people
they aren't against the 2nd amendment that's a persistent lie perpetuated by the right
@SenSchumer Then stop trying to play nice with Republicans. Stand up and fight, please!!!!
Sen Fienstein has fought more than most in this country for gun control- she's a major lion of congress
They're a deplorable bunch of. ™...
Please keep fighting to stop this madness coming out of D.C. Thank you for your support of all Americans!
@SenSchumer gun laws against law abiding gun owners doesn't stop criminals who commit gun violence.  Look at Chicago! #MAGA
this isn't about law abiding people - it prevents mentally ill from having guns
@SenSchumer your support for Islamic terrorists is what's really appalling.
what bullshit you throw out. Dianne Feinstein's commitment to this country is very clear
.@SenFeinstein Our deplorable Rep @SteveKnight25 voted yea. My dedication will be to get him ousted in 2018.
no what's appealing is your attempt to disarm Americans and reduce resistance to your liberal tyranny.
@SenSchumer read the fkng constitution you nitwit!
@SenSchumer times have changed. Too bad President Obama gave out guns to Mexico.....legally??? LOL  people are more aware now!
I think it's appalling that Democrats are whining so much I believe President Trump could be the best president we've ever had
@SenSchumer it's amazing that you are still in Congress
@SenSchumer what's appalling is the Democrats in both houses that are not willing to move on after election .
- What's appalling is your zeal to deny our 2nd Amendment Rights.  Please retire.
@SenSchumer why didn't you speak up when Obama wouldn't enforce imigration laws on the books? #HYPOCRITE
stay strong - watching cspan SAY NO! And work your brethren across aisle.
@SenSchumer  WHAA-WHAT "IS" APPALLING-IS: "A SENATOR WHO SWORE OATH TO UPHOLD-PROTECT-& DEFEND CONSTITUTION OF U.S.-BT WON'T!"
Time to leave
Governor Dan Malloy wants that and he is Democrat!
how could those republicans reflect their constituents views!!! How dare! Sarcasm btw
You are totally out of touch with everyone.  Keep drinking the rad left Koolaid  and you will remain there.
@SenSchumer Everything the Repugs are doing is appalling! Please keep up the fight and do ALL u can to save our country!
dummies in the house
@MrsMinna  Do what you can, @SenFeinstein, because you have CA's support. This is a public health issue; NRA is too powerful.
@SenSchumer give up your guns and security 1st then we can talk. We arm ourselves against rogue intentions. 2nd guarantees it.
a lot of what they're doing lately is appalling :(
it's simple Americans are on to your game. Give the government an inch and Govt takes a mile. #MAGA
@SenSchumer 8 years ago Chicago didn't have 400 shootings in two months
This is the Twilight Zone admin. #notmyprez It seems he cn't even hold an intelligent dialogue. Everything is a constant fight
Also APPALLING-YOUR support of #trump & the disaster in chief. Your reelection depends on your action-you're blowing it.
what makes them choose such an evil path? What happened to reasonable minds? Where is Christian charity?
wonder what they'll say when one of their loved ones falls victim due to their negligent actions.  #NRA has bought their souls
. Our rights are given by our creator, not government.  They are not a privilege. Defend the constitution, don't piss on it.
What about how impossible it is for law abiding NYC residents to obtain a carry permit? Except for some orthodox in boro park
The paycheck these guys are getting from the NRA must be huge - this defies all logic. #resist #persist
@SenSchumer GOP plan 2 NOT prevent the almost certain tragedy 2 follow that will make their ban & rights restrictions seem gd.
Chicago has the BEST GUN LAWS IN THE COUNTRY and they have the highest murder rate !!
They've got promises to keep. Ya know that hate of pay-for-play, unless it benefits me, thing? 
RT @SenFeinstein @Philos_Sofia
You should retire. You have ruined CA and ruin USA with your views and lies about the furture

I'm a little more appalled by a so-called President who had his whole campaign phoning Russia all last year
Any gun control is only an attempt to control the people and provides no safety whatsoever. Sandy Hook, Orlando.
Gun makers need to sell more guns. Untapped market. 
@Clintonite33 yeah.."apalling". Lol
@tkdmike Does anybody really think the GOP cares about American's lives anymore?
But you can have a gun, right?
& please do the right thing for we the people and demand an independent investigation of 45/Flynn/Russian it happened!
@tkdmike it's the era of absolute power at its worst.
Many appalling things in politics. You are fairly appalling yourself!
I think repubs want Americans to kill each other
@SenSchumer MONEY TALKS!
Whats appalling is Dems failed leadership on anything reasonable
get the message: these repugs are disgusting and will stoop at anything for the NRA their sourse of funds
That's pretty funny coming from a psychopath who carries a gun.
Does it ban 150 round full auto assualt clips?
@SenSchumer Yep good for them.
@SenSchumer what else is new...
focus on #Russia
i suppose since democrats havent read the constitution, youve never heard of the 2nd Ammendment
when will you give up your armed security?
What isn’t appalling about the current administration?  Nothing.
Keep up the good work! Accept no alternative facts. We've got your back. 93003
@SenSchumer Beam yourself up! And take fake tears Chuck with you. Al
@SenSchumer The outrage!! Bush hasn't been POTUS since Jan, 09. Are people in S.F. stuck in a perpetual 60 's time warp? ....
@SenSchumer Typical GOP.
What the NRA wants, the NRA gets...
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP bought and paid for by the NRA.
fake tears @SenSchumer it is more appalling that liberals divide the nation by speaking their hate & bigotry of our @potus
Start supporting the new Administration.
@SWANJAR Why did you vote in favor of Trumps admins????  #DemTraitor #NeolibRepublican
@SenSchumer Keep working on Laws that criminals won't follow, instead of getting Americans good paying jobs! Thanks Dianne!
maybe because Obama's OFA and Dems like you are pushing for a civil war?
@SenSchumer you're appalling. You guys lost. Quit fighting everything. Makes you look bad.
Thank you for speaking up and taking action to oppose this dangerous idea
please read the bill. Seniors who dont do own finances will be judge incompetent and lose their 2A rights
"Appalling" is what they do best @SenFeinstein
The Republicans? This should be left up to the #Chancellery, or the #SCOTUS, by judicial reveiw. The #demagogue shouldn't.
@SenSchumer both of you should just leave now and chuck i might shed a tear for you when u leave!  Naahhhhhh
@SenSchumer which bill?  Dem induced gun bills are worthless. Look at chicago more deaths there and toughest gun laws.
No intelligent human being will EVER demand less than the most advanced weapon afforded a capitalist market. #SocialismBlows
everything about the Republicans is appalling these days
Maybe, we should get rid of ALL political parties. Then, you'll be personally responsible for your own actions or lack of.
Hey, they gotta earn their paycheck from the NRA...
2A protects all the rest. There are already restrictions. It is great they are stopping this crap.
What part of "Approved UNANIMOUSLY and signed by President BUSH" don't you understand?
I don't care who signed it and voted for it, I was against it.
keep standing strong against the irrational gun lobby.
@SenSchumer what's appealing is the GOP investigating the leak not investigation POTUS!
I think you mean Appalling - unless misdirection appeals to you...
#INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN CONNECTION #DEMOCRATICLEADERSHIP There's a #Cou happening whether U want to admit it or not.
send them pics of the bodies of mangled children from CT and dead parishioners from SC
yep gun laws would have stopped both of those attacks.  How about more mental healthcare.
@SenSchumer @GOP Yet, utterly predictable. But let's see where we have common ground!
It's appalling that Republicans want ___________  (fill in the blank.)
@SenSchumer 
Dianne, times have changed. Too many anarchist Progressive Socialist destroying fabric of America.
Dems should propose a "Safety From Criminal Gangs Bill" which would reduce gun violence, but might also target their base.
it's also appalling that you and your husband take in billions for high speed rail, while Cali's infrastructure crumbles
@SenSchumer  have they lost their marbles??
Welcome to the new order of things!
you guys are running out of words it seems... crying wolf so often even your own party doubts you.
it's appalling that you have voted for every single Trump appointee
@SenSchumer appalling, yet not surprising. And, as always, illogical, immoral, disgusting, and profitable.
Yeah. Well, the USA was #Capitalist in the 18th and 19th century. This would be #Socialism then.
@SenSchumer Yeah but that was when Republicans had not yet sold the entirety of their souls to the devil for profit.
@SenSchumer keep fighting and get your message out to the people
Maybe they realized that they can see some republican policy is wrong.  You should do the same on your side.
@SenSchumer does "shall not be infringed" have meaning to you? Or the Constitution? Nope! You're a liberal socialist
@SenSchumer you both are bad for the USA
@SenSchumer Appalling is your attempt to attack our right to bear arms by using the FAKE term GUN SAFETY!
@SenSchumer Republicans=appalling.
Love thy Enemy
@SenSchumer all these actions in last 20 dats havd been appalling
@SenSchumer with all due respect, if possible, Congress should focus only on getting the US a WH we can believe and trust...
@SenSchumer Not as appalling as supporting sanctuary city?  Isn't SF where the illegal shot killed that young girl?
even WORSE that @GOP  is apparently TREASONOUS and wish to hide their RUSSIAN ASSETS!!! #INVESTIGATENOW #RussianCoup
@SenSchumer so so sad and dangerous for all Americans
@SenSchumer Was the bill doing what was really intended to do without friendly casualties?
@SenSchumer this @gop administration just seems to be intent on arguing against itself (and it's former self)
@SenSchumer Its appalling that Fakestein and Scumner would rather see you dead than protecting yourself. Fakestein carries.
Right now u need2 put most of ur energy towards fight Trump &every1 in the GOP being blackmailed by Putin & getting them out
@SenSchumer you two have no understanding of guns. Therefore you should remain silent. Look in mental health health reform
that is where the issue lies. The laws now don't get enforced. A shooters father calls the FBI about his son-nada
done about it. Gun store owner calls FBI and reports LEGAL buyer gets ignored. Seems like we have an FBI problem
Who is the FBI director again?  POS is in all of this 2 hes going to block investigation or try
@SenSchumer . You're both appalling. Maybe you should work harder on the campaign
@SenSchumer it's appalling that orange cheeto is still in the White House!
Like their leader, their idea of "make america safe" is upside down
they have to pay back their donors.  So corrupt.
My family knows how appalling the lack of this common sense law is...we lost a family member
@SenSchumer Absolutely nothing surprises me anymore 
does it surprise you?
they are doing this so their henchmen can commit murder and then plea insanity. No jail time. All part of their master plan.
yeah you got us. I thought we could slip one by you. But you're sooo smart.
@SenSchumer But our fake president tells us Immigrants are the enemy. Not mentally impaired citizens with guns. We are screwed
apparently u didnt read the bill.  Seniors who dont handle finances are considered impaired.  Really
@SenSchumer that is very desterbin
@SenSchumer - U get the feeling the GOP is trying to sneak in as much as they can before Prez Wingnut blows up? #Emoluments
4 all those GOPer's who are right 2 life advocates—2 words—SANDY HOOK
20 children+6 Adults+1 nutcase +LEGAL guns
two words fake news
@SenSchumer what makes you think Bush spoke for the majority? We will continue to block it!
GoP seem to be taking their lead from my 3 year old daughter. “No!”
@SenSchumer well, they're appalling, it's what they do.
@SenSchumer bush was the first to destroy usa
@SenSchumer disgusting!
@SenSchumer it is disgusting they are putting Americans at risk The world has gone mad. Russia and guns good protecting US bad
Everything the GOP does is appalling, including screaming "smaller govt" while they invade women's privacy.
@SenSchumer not appalling at all just logical!
blah blah blah. shut up
Can't put guns in charter schools without it.
@CNNnewsroom This absurdity is lost in all the noise about Trump. Politicians and media needs to be screaming about this.
Toughest GUN LAWS in America-CHICAGO ! doesn't work there.
also appalling #Beyoncé was screwed at the Grammys
Why ?? She sucks
you're appalling. Your record is appalling. Everything you stand for is appalling. You're husband getting federal contracts...
Again Dolt, enforce the laws on the books already, we have enough. People Kill People Guns  Are The Tool Fool Understand?
thankfully it hasn't passed and hopefully never will.  Yay for the inept congress.  The less you all get done, the better.
that NRA money though....
the more bullets i buy the NRA seems to get richer.  Maybe i shouldnt buy nra ammo?
I hope the first ones to suffer from the implementation of this are the ones who promoted it.
How? I'm curious to hear just how depraved you are....to wish harm upon an unarmed person.
go on Fox news...make that point
stop trump and his russian compromised admin and get him #impeachTrumpnow
But first, please investigate Obama/Hillary sale of uranium to their close buddy Putin.
sure they can investigate both i dont care, but yours was already proven false.  We are just starting on trump /putin ties.
your first mistake is expecting reason from any member of today's #republican party.
They aren't really Republicans anymore. They're just chills, wearing Republican masks.
They gotta keep their NRA ratings up.
Keep using that talking point. Go on Fox News; do interviews. Be bold and courageous! @SenSchumer @SenJeffMerkley @RonWyden
