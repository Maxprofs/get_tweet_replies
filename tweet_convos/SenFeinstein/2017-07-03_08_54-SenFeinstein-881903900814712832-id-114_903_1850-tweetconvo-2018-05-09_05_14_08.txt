@GOP moderates must take the right action to align with he moderate Dems to fix the #ACA, not destroy American healthcare and lives!
Our "centrism" has us $20 trillion in debt.  How much more, I ask?
Our only recent centrist president was Bill Clinton. We got a balanced budget under him.
YES say whatever about CLINTON - He Kicked ass and BALANCED OUR BUDGET! Surplus in treasury at completion Clinton term! THANK YOU CLINTON!
Yes and with being #bipartisan by working across the aisle.
There is no interest in that on either side, a bit naive to think there is.
They need to start
we don't need U. U shoved the DEAD Obamacare up our chatlie
No you don't you just want to spend more money
THANK YOU Senator Feinstein! YES what you have accomplished IS EXACTLY WHAT I as  MODERATE Californian Democrat WANT! SAVE and IMPROVE ACA
Oh #DiFi... https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/06/california-democrats-are-blocking-their-own-health.html … #singlepayer #healthcare #sb562
Taxes are passed down to the consumer.  Cut the taxes and reduce the cost.  Is that too hard for you to understand?
#improveACA
Everyone on planet earth already knows how @GOP & @realDonaldTrump lies. Lying asses mon-sun church going liars
Good start to fixing ACA. Bipartisanship w/Demkcrats is only way forward.
Who's saying that-McConnell? Sounds like that comes out of his http://mouth.GOP  don't care what's in bill just get rid of name.
Sad that republicans won't read it
Read the 1200 ACA regs in 2700 page law-it is not "fixable" after over $2.2B losses on failed exchanges, skyrocketing&disappearimg premiums
*Ahem*... https://interc.pt/2st4xCl 
#healthcare #singlepayer #sb562
You had eight years You are no longer in control, the Republicans will fix it, so don't worry about a thing Senator.
Not true.   Keep up fight  truths
@GOP lies all the time, every day.
So what about the Depart Health & Human Services showing ACA is working well...
No real fix in sight hc is expensive ind market broken before after aca
Why isn't anyone looking at this? If trump wrote it, it would be all over the news.
NO!Republicans & Dems DONT WANT ANYTHING to DO w/this Piece of $^&*it!
NEXT! What TO DO w/President who does NOT UPHOLD the Constitution?!!
Good ideas...need to be taken further; 400% above poverty is poverty in the Bay Area
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @GOP is the Party of Liars. Dems have submitted Bills to fix ACA & GOP won't look at
Dear Senator, why don't democrats make a public effort to spell out what we plan to do to improve ACA. Better messaging needed
Sure it's true, the Dems are obstructionist and they are the ones that created the ACA debacle!!
The fact... @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @amjoyshow @washingtonpost @nytimes
Thank you, Senator Dianne Feinstein.
If it's not universal healthcare paid for by taxing stock trades, raising short term capital gains rate and the 1%ers, its not good enough
Why don't you try working with the repubs to get it fixed instead of You Nancy and Chuckie just putting up road blocks
Can't you get together with @SenatorCollins or others to forge a bipartisan deal to fix #ACA?
Senator, please let the GOP know Americans have a right to health care. Medicare for all! Easy & affordable. Or we can have the Senate's HC.
ACA needs tweaking, not repealing.
Yes, your bill, there bill, both keep huge profits being made by the insurance companies so they can fund your campaign.SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM!
Improve HCA?   Gonna need to work w Reps as they need to work w Dems otherwise Americans are just stuck in the middle bearing the damage
We are both old enough to remember whe Medicare started.It went through "adjustments" and it works. ACA is a good start/needs "tweaking ".
Thank you Senator Feinstein!  BTW: We know that tRUMP & GOP REGIME in Congress are lying their A$$ES off so they can fool THEIR VOTERS.
The president says that all the time and I've heard some GOP Senators say they would like to work with Dems.
They are liars, well a lot of them anyway.
Republicans have ask for the Dems help and suggestions but you won't do it either.  Just keep resisting.
Thank you for your hard work!
Improving the ACA is not the same thing as Repeal and Replace.
Seeing that the democrats voted for Obamacare to begin with, how can we trust they want to improve it?
What happens to a 'Charlie Gard' in this country?

Does your bill reduce medical/pharma costs? I only see subsidies for people to pay ever increasing insurance premiums. #MedicareForAll
Democrats dnt want to fix Obamacare.
You guys want single payer.
You want us to have worse than you give our vets at the VA.
it's time for single payer. Get with the times.
Agree
Universal healthcare please.

@SenFeinstein please be more proactive and have interviews with @washingtonpost @nytpolitics @CNNPolitics @maddow to get details out!
See you want "Your" bill 
Won't even bother to Look at anyone else's 
We saw already saw "your" bill 
It's called Obamacare #EpicFail
.@GOP, take politics out of Americans' need 4 Affordable Healthcare. #Trumpcare #TaxCuts4Rich is not solution. STOP sabotaging Mkts, fix ACA
You should be demanding #medicareforall.
Democrats have been wanting to adjust/improve the ACA but @SenateMajLdr kept obstructing to undermine it. Disgusting old man!
Thank you.  That is true
You and DEMs had years.  Obamacare is failing.  Someone else's turn now.
Sounds like a great start
Disgusts me how easily they lie. Every Dem has said it needs fixing.
Dems need to be out everyday saying they want to work with GOP on improving ACA...take control of the negative message from Sen McConnell
Reps will surely (and soon) abandon disastrous travesty president Donald to get theACA improved along the win-win way.
As a taxpayer&citizen instead of compliaing ,why not publically offer ur willingness 2 work with POTUS .PUT US FIRST & PUT POLITICS ASIDE.
Great now package it in bullet points and start selling it on all media ASAP before its too late thanks
You should be owning this, not defending lies. Turn up the pressure and out the charade
Improving would mean getting government out of health. Your bill sucks.
You appear to be suggesting that your @GOP friends may be misleading the American people for personal or political gain.

Color me shocked!
Democrats ran on improving the #ACA. GOP won't acknowledge anything other than tax cuts for the rich.
You Dems are on your heels. When the GOP oinks a lie, don't waste time. Just say "BS", then attack on GOP fascism, racism, and misogyny.
When you put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig, true of #Obamacare or @HillaryClinton
A great first step to fix the ACA! #NoRepeal Thank you, Senator Feinstein!
I'm sure it's a real money  saver
#HR676NOW
This article was an excellent read.  Thanks for sharing and continuing to fight.
As an Independent voter, I move that @SenateGOP & @SenateDems work together to fix the #Healthcare system!
Time to put aside partisanship!
#MakeAmericaUnitedAgain! 
Get rid of the mandates, so we can have choices again.  That's what needs to happen.
Democrats should have been offering America the fixes for the ACA that the GOP uses against us. Where are Democrats leading? Just waiting...
Perhaps you might want to read Warren's proposal & understand that Dems are the minority & can't do much else with GOP Obstructing & Secrecy
I read it. No one else has apparently or cares too. The ACA is a disaster in many ways & the Dems offered no fixes to counter their "plan."
Warren's proposal does just that. If you're here to bash Dems, I'd say you're barkin' up the wrong tree. But that's on you.
Damnit. I not "here to bash Dems" any more than you're here to avoid the facts. You know what's going on...I am just as wrecked as you are.
We did it's Obama care. No thanks I'll stick with Trump
People who don't have or can't afford health insurance get by. My friend, a women with 3 kids, got along fine with no insurance.
oh Tom. This isn't true at all, and you know it.
Please enact & sign the #SinglePayer Act (see U.S. Const. art I, § 8; art. VI, cl. 2).
 Constitution "trumps"  Insurance Lobby et al.
The fact that healthcare is now politicalized, nothing in this bill supports the average US citizen. #POTUS
McConnell won't allow any input from DEMS.  Much money from Koch Bros is riding on this.
I think this is great and worth pursuing.  Get this out to more media etc.
Well, to be fair, Republicans lie at lot lately.
U want higher tax 4 folks who went 2 night school 4 many yrs, working full time& taking care of fam.Will the tuition b retroactively credit?
Your bill was Obamacare, Di. It's failing. You don't get to break something and then insist on being the one to fix it.
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP also lie.
Call call, rmail.....CALL. Now, or cry later
What can you expect from the treasonous, lying, deplorable @GOP that are in Congress today? #SaveACA
Most want universal healthcare, in fact.
... just not most of the Democrat reps... :(
Admitting Democrats are elected officials and giving them a seat at the table, defeats the option of authoritarianism.
why not just call it the health care tax? How about removing state boundaries and let the competition drive down price?
more complicated than it sounds, look into the built-in roadblocks; insurance companies will map out areas of coverage create no competition
Stick your bill where the sun definitely doesn't shine @SenFeinstein 
We've always wanted to improve it. Republicans just wanted to repeal it. Until they didn't.

Dont let GOP control the narrative.
You've had years under Obama to improve it. After the repeal, maybe the DEMS will WORK with the GOP to come up with something that works.
1. Repeal Obamacare / ACA
2. Lower taxes (corp. and personal)
3. Build the wall.
4. Finance Medicaid (Single-Payer) with a Consumer Tax
All racists are blocked!
