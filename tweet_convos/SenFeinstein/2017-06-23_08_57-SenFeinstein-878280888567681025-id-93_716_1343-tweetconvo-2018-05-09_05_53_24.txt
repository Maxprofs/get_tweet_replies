(2/3) Join me and @SenKamalaHarris: We’re telling the Trump administration NO on opening up CA marine sanctuaries. https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=A27DAB55-3C2E-4E4C-90F3-EC25D040EE18 …
(3/3) Channel Islands Sanctuary has had 11.6 million visitors since being designated in 1980. It’s a wonderful place with so many sights!
It also seems like the angrier Trump gets the more EOs he signs to damage the US environment permanently.  he is mentally ill. #unfitforjob
Likes vengeance
He has no respect for the environment, he & his greedy friends worship money!
Guessing we won't be seeing any oil derricks anywhere near Trump Intl in Palos Verdes. Maybe a few 100 protests outside will get his attn.
THE CONGRESS OVERTURNED OBAMA EXEC ORDERS. OVERTURN THIS ONE. HANDLE IT, IF YOU HAVE TIME, BETWEEN HOUNDING @HillaryClinton & @billclinton.
Given the article in today's LA Times, it appears that the market for oil products is diminishimy. No market, no sales.
They've been in the Gulf of Mexico for years. Remember BP? I like and value you, Senator. But, it's not just CA that deserves preserving.
We in Michigan have our own problems.Our waterways have been threatened by foreign plant and wildlife.Outstaters say entitlement yet no help
Invasive species are a problem in a lot of this country. The Fed should be funding programs to address this. tRump is slashing what we have.
Agreed.
Then you better get a good attorney for that eo.  Another golf course, huh.  Rite in town near new rigs, mmm lv smelloil.
Tell 45 to shove the 'executive' order.
So shut up or bend over and take it. YOU ELECTED THEM
Bull in a China shop he's destroying everything in his path
DT seems driven 2 kill all living creatures&the environments they live in! His crude  jokes are inappropriate! Climate Change is not a joke!
This is being done to punish California.
DT would do such an awful act to Punish California?That is an unthinkable act! This 
is a dangerous man,unfit to govern
Never!
Si podemos!
IF YOU'RE SO DAM WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP, IMPEACH HIM. YOU HAVE THE EVIDENCE. BUT NO. YOU WANT MORE BLOOD FROM @HillaryClinton, @billclinton. NO
YOU CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH OPEN, DEFIANT TREASON BY POTUS & FAMILY. YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE ENVIRONMENT? I AM ASHAMED OF YOU.
But you and Grassley have time to hound @HillaryClinton and Loretta Lynch. Stop hounding DEMS. PAY ATTENTION TO TRUMP & TREASON WITH PUTIN.
How do we stop it?
Stop this crazy action u have my support
This is infuriating! 
DO YOU THINK THAT PUTIN IS DONE? HE IS INSIDE OUR GRID, I.T. NETWORKS, BANKS, EVERYTHING AND YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE BILL, HILLARY& LYNCH?
WHY DO YOU CARE? You don't seem concerned sbout Trump, Flynn, Jared,Ivanka  committing TREASON. Secret lines to Russian Embassy, FAKE NEWS
He wants to open money and data laundering facilities on them so he can keep his collusion with Russia ongoing.
Agreed!
Fight Fight Fight! Reality is getting hard to handle.
Instead, let's get our oil from countries that sponsor terrorism.  Good strategy!
We need the oil and the gas to be cheaper since @JerryBrownGov wants to add taxes.  You loonie dems just want to tax us to death.  U R Nuts.
Why not. Won't if be good for the economy?
Say No to Trump
Pesky animals always in the way eventually we will kill them all
Killing our environment while we focus on everything else not enough hands to hold up the sky.
#StopTrump
Senator, please continue to fight Trump and his republican enablers. My senior parents can't believe what they're trying to do. #AHCA
#45 is vengeful. Stay strong CA you inspire the rest of us.
No way!  Opens up hunting bears, no Paris Agrmt, dismantling environmental Regs. What is wrong with him? He's killing earth!
Ahhh you don't have choice deal with it Cali.

<angry>Are you eFing kidding me</angry>. Who can I write or fax to?  I'm all in! Don't want to see Star Trek IV happening IRL.

Keep your country great
Actually we can - stop big government
Please tell us what we can do, other than throw more money at ActBlue
Please do everything you can to stop Trump!

Right
What can dems do to own the news and dominate the headlines? Time to take over
Thank God!!! California has gone off the deep end with sanctuaries of all kinds, marine, illegal aliens, endangered weeds!!!  WTF?!
Thank you, we need to protect our valuable lands, oceans and wildlife
This is most morally bankrupt bunch of takers I have ever witnessed in this country. They are going to take and sell until USA is wiped out.
I hope you are being truthful this time.  Drill baby drill.
WTH is wrong with him???
I imagine Trump has many more cruelties forthcoming for blue states. 1st blow courtesy of BRCA.
What about EPA regs??? And what about alternatives? Can we find solutions? Hurry!!!
How do we become energy independent?
Thank you for your work. We have to stop #Trump from destroying our Planet!
SAFELY drilling with regs reduces provides large amounts of tax revenue to local and national govs and schools which could reduce gov debt.
I was in Mexico in 2012 and there was still oil in the water from the gulf spill. There is no guarantee of safe drilling   Money isn't >life
Yes we can!
It's a new day going forward we're going to do what's good for all Americans
Let him drill on his own properties.
He can drill on mine!
Save our health care first and foremost and help get this fraud out of the White House- PLEASE!!!
@SenKamalaHarris Ladies, we are counting on you, @Govjerrybrown and @GavinNewsom to protect our beautiful state from these greedy pigs!
They want to destroy everything that makes our country beautiful and replace it with a vast, festering garbage dump, all for hubris & greed.
He is just plain crazy and in the pocket of big business
Why is this Russian spy still the POTUS?
#INSANITY
Really
After the recent tax hikes in California 

I'll bet you can !
Secede from this Union before it's too late!!
SENATOR WE SHOULD USE EVERY ARGUMENT TO PRESERVE NATURE THE TREATS TO EXTINCTION !POLLUTION ,CLIMATE CHANGE ,ALL THESE AND MORE!
I would assume that you will fabricate your arguments and not get the facts. Right?
Run on solar or batteries and leave fossil energy to the rest of us. California wants to live  pristine life while others pay consequences.
You left wing liberal's are full of criticism and hatred but you come up with no answers and no ideas
I beg to differ
And that's your right
Your husband have contracts in mind?  Shameful how you have directed business to him throughout your time in the Senate! 
They need to keep their grifting paws off of California.
No. We must not let this happen!
Resist!!!!
Did you say anything about McConnel arresting protesters in wheelchairs?
@NationalADAPT
LIAR.....
DEPLORABLE.....
We have a president who knows he hasn't a single heroic bone in his body, so he over-compensates playing the villain. A truly demented man.
Well you are letting him attack our free press, divide our country, protect Russia, pollute our air, displace Indians, think he cares?
She's not "letting" him do anything.
Well she is not speaking out enough. No one in gov. are
Girl Putin wants that oil.
No we can't. 45 must be stopped. As a Californian I hate to see this happen.
No we must stop him !
Just accept, Trump is off his head, get him constrained!
Letsplay
No we can't no!
