Just got off a call with @SenFeinstein & hundreds of local leaders. We’re in agreement – this disastrous health care bill must be stopped.
Don't worry, your minions in Sacramento killed it. Oh, you meant #Trumpcare, huh? #SenatorSellout #PrimaryFeinstein #PrimaryHarris
@SenKamalaHarris thank you, Senators!
California is proud to have two Senators who care about their constituents.  Great job ladies.
I feel the same gratitude for #Oregon Senators #Wyden & #Merkley! 
Truly representing #WeThePeople!
Agreed, #Wyden and #Merkley look out for the people who elected them, and put country before party.
West Coast, Baby!
Keep up the fight - and we will work to get through SB562 in CA to lead the way to universal health care!
Dianne, You and RBG have to find a way. DO NOT Leave!
#StrongerTogether #FightForDemPrinciples
The passion is inspiring! We're ready to fight!
#HillaryWON #TrumpRESIGNImmediatelly
I am so proud and grateful for our CA senators, past and present.
I would be happier if they supported universal healthcare.
I agree. I know that single payer in CA is being promoted in the Senate.  Insurance commisioner making statements about  public option. #CA
it will not be single payer, it will slave payer. The 50% will be forced to slave for the whole country as they r the only ones that pay
All insurance is fundamentally shared risk/shared cost for mutual benefit. Cheers.
Used to be.
Excellent just got off a call with the 50% that pay taxes u know our money ur using to make ins companies rich with ACA tax revolt time
Congress should get the "same" health insurance plan that they pass in this stupid bill.  -- it will never pass then !

One lies, the other swears to it
You're going to regret standing against the taxpayers
Power on ladies- we are out here calling, walking, writing & praying.  Unite us, lead us and help us to rise: Justice guides us not greed.
@billmaher meet 2 more strong Democrats who are not afraid to stand up and speak out. Both women. #SupportThem instead of bashing Dems.
We need to get profit driven insurance companies out of the health care system. #SinglePayer
As not having had insurance for many years, I appreciate the ACA. With that said, I've had a really tough time getting it to actually work.
@SenKamalaHarris Please do fight!
Your current healthcare Law the ACA can't even provide this kid quality diapers under Medicaid give me a break .
You should have stopped Obamacare years ago.  What were you thiking when you passed that abortion.
At this point, anyone who does NOT oppose #Trump's "Healthcare" bill needs to be investigated for #UnAmericanActivities. 
#WeSeeYou.
Thank you we depend on you
Well the PPL are waiting to see how Trad Dem's will fight for We the People
DP needs to get real+hook up equally w/Prog's to WIN
@spjain88 Still working my way thru text of bill but I sure have concerns.  Thanks @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris
All you people do isTalk,& do nothing,As a center Right Dem I & Many others like me Have had just aboutEnough of The same Crap.Do Something!
UNITED WE STAND FOR ALL!!!!!  STRONGER TOGETHER for AMERICA!
Yes!  Fight for us in 95073 and everywhere else!  Proud to have 2 amazing senators!
If you don't want to see a full Government take over of Healthcare with a Single-Payer system, then read this. 
Emailing my Representative, Sen. Diane Feinstein @SenFeinstein on Violence, Resistance, Healthcare, Tax Reform, & My Vote in 2018. 
Sen Fein, let's keep OCare since no one can AFFORD the PREMIUMS or DEDUCTIBLES resulting in NO ACCESS TO CARE. A LIB/DEM FAILING HLTH CARE!
Could we please see the plan you & @SenKamalaHarris have to fix current Obamacare situation, or are you just going to whine abt GOP plan?
Thank you for all you do! I just wrote a fax to Rubio and Nelson. #resist #trumpcare is #deathcare
@TomPerez 

We need this type of support and enthusiasm from every elected democratic. 

Please help rally your troops. 

Please!
We the people are with you a big hug keep the good work.
Good I also hope you're ready to lose!! you dummy craps never learn do you?? # No Clue
Mahalo for showing compassion and empathy; of which the GOP has none.
Thank you!!
Your state wants to secede. Why should we do what you want. Still remember you wanted to decide who GA06 rep was going to be.
Maybe you and Kamala could conference @Rendon63rd too?
2/2 For YOUNG pple who  aren't mandated..a "placeholder" premium. Gives them option to buy in, applies toward their ful lprmm when they do.
1/2 If not single payer..offer public option..Give us the CHOICE. Ins cos stay in market but they HAVE to be fairly competitive
How about we extend the fight to getting single payer healthcare passed in CA....it was voted down by a DEMOCRAT.....
I Agree 
I wish you all had been so feisty about Obamacare and it's ability to sustain at lower premiums.  HC companies are bailing out. #nocoverage
This should be Trump's & GOP last chance at governing.  It's beyond stupid at this point
I could not agree more. Enough already.
Pls keep tweeting updates we need that connection with u now more than ever.
Thanks Senators
We can do it
THIS DISABLED AMERICAN WILL DO EVERYTHING LEGAL WITHIN MY POWER TO OPPOSE AND FIGHT THE MEAN GREEN GOP MACHINE!!!!!???????????
CA wants state single-payer health care now, without delay.  All CA Dem politicians should be supporting and pushing CA single payer.
Must be at all costs!!
I don't know that sheriff in WI said something about torches&pitchforks I think we  real Americans are gearing up for something like that
what are you doing to support #MedicareForAll ? Or do you think that your constituents should just continue to pay highest med prices?
Duh...
Thank you !
What would happen if ya'll made some changes to FDA and big pharma? Less campaign $$? American food company & legacy medicine is killing ppl
Love you both and the amazing work you are doing!!
How??? Tell us and we will do it!!
Yes. Support @RandPaul & repeal ACA. AHCA needs even more cuts-basically it's ACA2.0. We have a $20T deficit- Thanks Obozo!
Please Sen,  write an alterative bill to improve the ACA! Give reason why the Democrats should win back congress!!
It's too bad the disastrous Affordable HC Act was not met with scrutiny before screwing with my HC increasing my costs by 6k per year.
@SenKamalaHarris Senator please read my tweets
Do everything you can to see this bill is stopped! Call you republican colleagues!
You're now ready? What have you been doing?
Please fight!!
My two faves! 
@KamalaHarris, DEMs fight like your lives depend on it! Then fight to take over house in 2018! That's the only way YOU ALL can stop Trump!
You're ready to fight?! Fight what?! You all sound like such fakes!
U have ruined the DNC w/ ur BS, get out. You said "We have to sign it before we can see what's in it"
Yes!
If you don't like it then work with GOP and come up with something. Quit resisting and obstructing. Sick and tired of the left complaining
Call the GOP bill what it is - the real DEATH PANELS.
Thank you! California can be proud! Sen Feinstein and Kamala Harris. You both do us proud!!!
First, go out and win some elections.
Then do the will of the people you serve
Great! Please don't call it a healthcare bill.
Why aren't you working to shape the bill? ??
2/2
Next the screams and people dying because they don't have any medical care because Dems are obstructionist
1/2
I would like to see you block it. Then I would love to see Obama Care fail.
@SenKamalaHarris 
The #SoCalledPresident  is trying to send us back to the stone age.
The American people need to see the passion.
Thank you, from Kansas City!
@SenKamalaHarris People protesting the new Healthcare plan must be stopped. Resist the radical liberals.
Please stop this horrible bill.
Ready to fight with you!

#GotYourBack
Thank you for your hard and efforts against #TrumpCare
5 Repugs are 's down for their own SELFISH reasons WHICH works for me as long as WE defeat itObamaCare isn't perfect but WE CAN FIX IT
Thank you Senator and @KamalaHarris!
Drown them in amendments. I propose one: for every doctor's visit anyone has, the bill is sent directly to McConnell.
Amazing how you focus on less than 1% of the population
I agree - let's let the failing OCare ride out and see what happens to everyone that ends up with no healthcare.
Feinstein needs to stop pretending to give a damn. She parrots right wing talking points against #HR676 #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer.
very recent actions and communications have been showing a shift back to the left  I have been very critical in past, like changes of late
Thank you, Senators. Proud to be Californian.
Thank you for fighting for us !
Thank you!! We are counting on you!
There's nothing you can do Diane. Dems are not the majority and you are not the majority leader and you are not the speaker of the house.
Power team! Show them what California stands for: innovation, equality, fairness for all! #noACHA #fixnotrepeal
Thank you. Proud of my fierce Senators'
Thank you, thank you for looking out for Americans
But the sorry pathetic super rich need more money!  So unfair to them.
California Reps! We support your efforts to stop this terrible bill from becoming law! .@SenKamalaHarris Lead the resistance!!
Thank you for your hard work to stop this.
YES Senators Feinstein and Harris! Trumpcare is recipe for disaster! Please stop from passing! We want CA single payor or ACA upgraded.
What's the plan? Feel like we've been saying all the right things but there's no real way to stop it. Are you working with R's to oppose?
Can we please push universal healthcare for California? Please?
Thank you both!
POS #45 is already hinted at the "nuclear" move that was used with Gorsuch.  Then what?  When will you get him stopped? we need you to do it
@SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris thank you for your leadership! It was a great call. We are with you and ready to fight! #HealthCareBill
Why haven't you been trying to help the millions of Americans who have already lost Ins due toObamacare. Are you trying to help those people
@SenKamalaHarris, we are counting on our great California Senators to beat back this god-awful bill. Give 'em hell!
Give em all you've got!!!!
Right let's stick with the current disastrous law. Why is it that everything congress does costs Americans 2X as much & works 1/2 as good?
You want to see passion? Come visit the grassroots that are growing like wild grass since Jan. 20th.  Nothing gonna mow down new grassroots
Get Senator Heller involved! He is a voice of reason among the sea of complicit GOP leadership.
Was just thinking same thing. This could be a moment to take advantage of, if possible. We'll push him from NV side!
Thank you for your dedication to the well being of our country and her people.
Conference call 'til yer ass falls off, Senator. You don't have the votes and your rah rah rhetoric is disappointing.
Oh, Senators! 
I wish they ALL could (vote like) California Girls!
Soooo...absolutely no room for "we're ready to negotiate a fix" huh? So break it and just leave, that's what we're going with. Nice.
Thank you for standing up against this!
Your gang put us in this boat you did a horrible job with Obamacare now you're trying to hold us back again
#propaganda and #rhetoric
I for one am glad to see you still have passion on matters not concerning you being surveilled by the CIA.
Could you two run on a ticket together? Decide between yourselves who is Veep and who is Pres. I'm in!
FYI we are seriously jealous on the east coast 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN THIS
BILL FROM ALL THAT HAVE READ IT ;SAY IT WOULD HURT ALL THOSE IN NEED !HOW COULD WE TURN OUR BACKS ON SO MANY MILLIONS
And those of us in California are grateful to you and @SenKamalaHarris for standing up for us.
Um, if you're not fighting yet...?
Thanks for your hard work @SenFeinstein & @SenKamalaHarris fighting this bad bill. Now let's talk fixing the Affordable Care Act
They've had a decade to "fix" the unfixable, and never bothered trying. We're not having their "fix". We're getting our healthcare back.
What are you doing to stop it? Virtual moralism doesn't count.
Yay!!!!!
We are with you!
@ECMcLaughlin
Thank you Senators Feinstein and @SenKamalaHarris Harris!
Americans are counting on you to save our democracy and our health care! Thank you for fighting for us!
We're a Constitutional Republic, you twit. #Obamacare was a system of medicine, not healthcare. We're taking our healthcare BACK from gov't.
I totally agree!! Kick some butt ladies!!
Agreed , Get the Ins Lawyers & Politicians away from our Dr.s, Medicaid 4 all ,poor 4 free, Rich pay 10%, Valid SSI#s, Politicians included!
Your approval isn't required. After suffering #Obamacare disaster, your input isn't desired. The middle class is getting healthcare back.
@SenFeinstein @ChuckGrassley https://www.facebook.com/grassley/posts/10155337028285797 …
I have some questions about Grassley fb post!! Don't you?
Maybe have a talk w @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @DeanHeller @SenJohnMcCain I know we will be..... @SenKamalaHarris
You go gals!! We got Ur backs! We stand shoulder 2shoulder w/you in this fight. Tell us what more we can do as Californians @SenKamalaHarris
We are all ready to fight for people's lives.
Counting on you!
@Senfeinstein you better hurry trump disregards another piece of constitution daily
Maybe the insurance corporations would shut up if states threaten to stop enforcing mandatory car insurance for their profit?
Where were you when #Obamacare #Obamascare got shoved down the countries throat? BTW. Lost my doctor and my insurance.
It was all in the name of protecting you from yourself, you chose the wrong plan and wrong doctor.

Also, they don't give a shit.
I love you two. I am proud to be a true son of California. Fight! Resist! Give no ground!
was the call with California electeds? what is the plan?
"Healthcare"?? It's "health insurance"
Get your narrative straight, socialist.
Another Democrat threatening violence. When will it end?
