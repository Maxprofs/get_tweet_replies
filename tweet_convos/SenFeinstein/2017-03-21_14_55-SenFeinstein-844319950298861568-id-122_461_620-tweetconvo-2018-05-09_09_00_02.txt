@SenFeinstein @SenFranken he simply ruled according to write law. He didn't legislate from the bench like liberals do.
too stupid Tim. All judges EXCEPT Girsuch ruled FOR employee. Gorsuch wrote descent
can't refute so call me "stupid?" Is that the best you offer? That's stupid! #Pathetic
where dud u get claim that he ruled according to law, so law needs change? Not true
not created law, but law as written.
revoke my apology. Either stupid or belligerently uninformed.  No longer care. Tata.
Okay. Happy life to you and yours.
The 10th Circuit didn't rule against Plaintiff in this case. Nor did Gorsuch. He simply wrote dissentng opinion.
Dissent means disagree..gorsuch was against this trucker's case.
Genius. The court ruled in favor of the employee. Your statement has absolutely nothing to do with my comment.
...instead, he wants to know what would he have done.  If you want to know why did he rule that way, ASK!
@SenFeinstein YES
- because he's on the side of big business?
Write better laws and that wouldn't happen. Shame on the legislators for incompetence.
This isn't about the senators, this is about Gorsuch.  He has no empathy for ordinary people.
The trucking company was owned by a GOP donor! That's why he sided w/ the trucking cmpny
Doubtful.Perhaps thats the way you would operate.Have you watched the hearings at all?
what idiots.....who voted for this Franken??
We won't know until you shut up and let him answer the question!  In this case, he didn't even ask that.
.@JudiciaryDems @SenFranken There can be no SCOTUS vote while 45 regime under FBI investigation.
the judge being judged shoe does not fit right for this judge
huh?
@SenateDems @SenFranken Please do not fall for his polished demeanor. He will take us backwards. Besides he's being evasive.
not polished at all. Smirking pompous ass -what I saw. Luvd Franken Qs removed smirk
why did Gorsuch not answer? Because that truck driver was expendable in his eyes. Cares more about trucking co
looked up CDL regulations for 7 states. None say Truckers must sacrifice life & limb for cargo Co.
STOP THE HEARINGS!
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken I don't know...why do we allow illegals into our country everyday.why are most politicians corrupt?
Law said he was legally aloud to reject operation of the equipment, not disobey superiors #liberallogic #MAGA
all the other judges in case ruled FOR employee.  Gorsuch only descenting judge. FOR company. $$$
@SenateDems @SenFranken That's. My. Senator. 
Lucky
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken Because he followed the law. Not his feelings.
#gorsuch is disgusting for trying to dodge the question & for ruling against this hard working US truck driver
Democrats must pull out of Gorsuch hearing until FBI Trump investigation is delivered to American people.
These candidate must study "Leave It To Beaver's" Eddie Haskell on how to avoid answering a question. Amazing. @JudiciaryDems @SenFranken
@SenateDems @SenFranken agree with SenFranken re absurdity/questionable judgment. No confirmation PLEASE. Counting on YOU ALL
@SenateDems @SenFranken This seat should not be filled. It's a stolen seat by a stolen election. No to Gorsuch!
@SenateDems @SenFranken why did dreamers 18 years ago rape a 3year old? That's the question!
no why don't you go and read the whole story...Once again Dems not telling the whole truth!!
why ask "why"waste of time
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken He's unethical, especially sitting there, lying while smiling under oath, &unsuitable as Scotus
@SenateDems @SenFranken 
Democrats have already made up their minds.  They are not interested in truth.
DEMS ARE A JOKE 
@SenateDems @SenFranken I turned hearings off. I know how U roll #judgeThomasHearing. Stop wasting our money #confirmGORSUCH
@SenateDems @SenFranken #GorsuchHearing confirmation should ride on how he answers question. Life or death for the driver?
Thank you for wasting my time today.
The man is mean & a Republican shill. We know that. So WHY ARE YOU APPEARING AT THIS FARCE OF A HEARING?
WHY ARE YOU THERE? PULL EVERYTHING AND GET OUT OF THE ROOM.
He followed the law! He's a judge. His personal feeling don't matter. What a bunch of liberal snowflakes!
the law restricted him from how he would have liked. Judging isn't how we want it to be, but interpreting the law
@iamfonda @SenFranken How can he be "impartial" with his lips and wallet glued to the GOP?
fantastic!
@iamfonda @SenFranken I bet it was for MONEY! Anyway,Fascism and Mysogeny should be ENOUGH to disqualify him. Keep it up, Al!
Aside from the fact he is@an a**, follow the $!
I will tell you why.  He is in the pocket of big businesses.  Not what we need in a SCOTUS judge.  Good job Al!
He is going to be on the #scotus and there is nothing you can do about it #Crybabys. Your all crooked. #MAGA
@SenateDems @SenFranken the way Judges are sent to the SC is broken.
@SenateDems @SenFranken Stupi queztion.  He followed the law
@SenateDems @SenFranken the ugly truth of trucking look it up. Truckers are put in bad situations and unsafe situations
@CathyWentzel @SenFranken   He's a racist pig just like the treasonous fool who recommended him. WE DON'T WANT HIM!
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken He didn't rule against man. He ruled based on law. If law needs to change, change it.
@iamfonda @SenFranken terrific job Al! I LOVE how prepared you are and how masterfully you box in those you are questioning!
@SenateDems @SenFranken 
Al's right.
@SenateDems @SenFranken Wonderful questioning, Sen Franken.
the family for dying on the job b/c his soul abandoned the truck? If he died, could the family sue?
Yea, it's insanity. This guy is our next Supreme Court Judge and he voted against the guy who almost died.
Unbelievable
Say what?? So he was stuck 2 hrs no heat and fired b/c he left his truck for survival? Would they sue
Bcuz he's a douche
@SenateDems @SenFranken because he a partisan hack.
Thank you Sen. Franken for showing America what this judge has done to working American.
This confirmation hearing needs to be postponed until after we know about Russian collusion w/vote
@SenateDems @SenFranken Gorsuch demonstrates pure prickness at confirmation hearing.
With all due respect Senator @alfranken in your passionate question, you stated we drive 70mph in -14F weather, not I. Cautiously it's icy.
@SenateDems @SenFranken Thank you @SenFranken! You rock. Good line of questioning!
I can't begin 2 dream what the next few decades would be like having 2 endure that callous obtuseness
@SenateDems @SenFranken  hreat question!!!!!
i know that we didnt hear the whole trial -i dont know how anyone could side w comp
@SenateDems @SenFranken Gorsuch will be inducted to the Supreme Court-give it up you weak libs-fait accompli...
very angry...work on that for a better life. lol
@SenateDems @SenFranken Tough call, but to the letter of rule, only covered if did not operate. Maybe laws should be clearer?
He ruled according to the law, but am sure with empathy for the trucker.  Hard decision.
@SenateDems @SenFranken why is he even having a hearing? #GarlandNotGorsuch @russfeingold #unconstitutionalgop
@SenateDems @SenFranken He's not to favor a plaintiff or defendant he's to judge impartially & not favor an outcome /agenda.
It's simple, he backs business over people
@SenateDems @SenFranken #stolenseat  FACE IS A THIEF
That's easy ANTI LABOR   period
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken Franken, you would not understand if he drew you a picture. Judges follow law not their hearts.
we need to know if he follows either
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken He rules according to the law not by his emotions which what a judge is supposed to do.
@lskurrus @SenFranken #Gorsuch what a condescending d*ck! Again, only dancing around. No direct answer. #GorsuchHearing
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken Hate to disagree with Sen. Franken, but I KNOW EXACTLY why Gorsuch had difficulty answering that Q
once again Franken proves he's a complete a-hole. Proves for the 1st time that he knows nothing about trucks
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken It has to do with following the law! Something the Democrats lack!
Judge Gorsuch repeatedly said he applied the laws and regulations as written by CONGRESS. #MAGA
he lied
Would you rather him follow the law and the constitution or be a libtard judicial activist? @JudiciaryDems @SenFeinstein @SenFranken
Laws and morals are two different things.  He can't make a moral decision, obviously based on his non-response.
@cmclymer with the hitched or unhitched trailer?  That is the question? Really?
see, can't answer common sense Q's with common sense
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken I watched Gorsuch try to answer this question. He's an extremist. Judges aren't English teachers.
@cmclymer @SenFranken The package he comes in belies what lies beneath.The facade cracked as the day wore on #JustAnswerThe?
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken because he ruled with the law on the books which was poorly written by the Senate
my gosh, keep up. He was ONLY descending juspdge!  Defendant did win, but no thanks
to Gorsuch. That was descenting judge. Only judge who thought ok for co to fire him
@SenFeinstein @SenFranken For goodness sake! This question is too simplistic to even consider answering. C'mon people!!
Loved Franken's questioning!
love the common sense approach to legal pompous ass
Who will America believe?
The entire time @SenFranken makes this a matter of morality. Judicially, it's a matter of LAW. Appeal to Emotion Fallacy.
Because he decided to 'legislate from the bench'. 'Operating' a vehicle <> 'driving'. Ask any cop.
@cmclymer @SenFranken Because he's an asshole. Or just excellent GOP material.
Oh wait.
Same thing.
Next.
it's unfortunate people don't understand a judge's role, the law and how it applies in reaching a verdict
Senator Franken, the voice of reason...  I love this guy.
He's the voice of ignorance of the law or judicial process as usual.
I love Senator Franken he asks what matters and what we want to hear.
cuz he's a MF & we all know it! Keep him off the court.
We can't. He's getting through no matter what.... next pick is far more important
If this is the best you can come up with against #Gorsuch he'll be confirmed with 95 votes.
say hello to your new Supreme Court justice morons.
LMAO! DUH !!!
seriously!  You know the law on that case was followed. Change the law maybe.
@EricShapiro3 @SenFranken say no to gorsuch
Answer: For the same reason the case was up before the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
I'd like know why Gorsuch ruled against the trucker. Odd. Was there a conflict of interest w/other party??? Hmm..
Trucking company owned by GOP DONOR!
OMG! Judge Gorsuch is just as corrupt as the rest of the TrumpTeam! Fair judge, yeah, to the one w/$$
and he's even more pompous than Clarence Thomas. Didn't think that was possible
because the law matters!
Thank you Sen Franken.
