To have voted in an insurance program no one can afford or use that ruined the healthcare system of USA was irresponsible and inexcusable.
Which didn't happen, so why are you bringing it up?  Oh yeah, propaganda.
It did happen. I now pay $1466 a month for my family with a $12900 deductible and zero subsidy...wish you were on it with me
Yep! And I have to hear daily from millionaire athletes, actors and politicians  how happy I should be.
You have a valid complaint... Against the Texas state government, which has undermined the ACA:
I mean, yes, there are problems, a lot of them caused by deliberate attempts to sabotage the ACA by the Republican party.  Which is now ...
... doing its level best to pass legislation to destroy it entirely, replacing it with nothing, which will help you in no way at all.
If we had a free mkt - price would go down look at procedures like lasik, plastic surgery, etc. when gov gets involved we get the fucking VA

Potential cost increases by state:
- AK: $31,790

- ME: $16,437…
Just like passing  Obamacare then reading what is in it?
Sad you tweet when you're so ill-informed.

Why don't you Google the Washington Times and see what it says about its credibility as a news source.
Excuse me! CBO analysis is virtually never anything but a farce!
AMEN to that. Not to mention the bill is cruel anyway
If you love Ocare so much how come you and your colleagues are exempt!! Ocare has destroyed my dreams and now cost more than my mortgage.GFY
You mean kind of like voting on Obamacare before we read it remember..." we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it". Save it hypocrt
So here's what you can tell all up there in DC, don't pass the bill and you all will be on Aca. So will all of your staff, call it cut backs

We are hoping that @SenJohnMcCain & @lisamurkowski vote on the side of the people.  The R's know it's a bad bill, they just want a "win!"
Should be illegal. This is too important to leave to chance
What EXACTLY does it do?!!
The CBO works off current theoretical data. I remember the 1st and 2nd CBO scores from O Care
Guess you don't remember passing the ACA
Did that with the ACA
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Like you guys ever REALLY pay attention to the CBO??? STALL STALL STALL.

Bribing #lisamurkowski by allowing AK to keep ACA Is #Despicable, #irresponsible and #inexcusable 
#GrahamCassidy 
#SaveACA
That's republicans for you!
Oh like obamacare
Do YOU have a solution?
They are criminal hypocrites.
Actually, its evil and is a violation of the obligation every senator has to serve his/her constituents. Democracy is a joke in our ongress.
CBO does a poor job. Look what they said about Obama care
Its confirmed, dyslexic thought process.
The Kochs are holding $400million in campaign finances hostage until they pass a repeal.  That is what is going on here.
Yup, it was in the news last night. The R's went back with word from their donor's, not their constituents. Says a lot !
Obamacare was a lie to the American people !! Get over it !
And should be god-damn illegal. I hope we survive and are able to address some of the bullshit allowed by congress and pres.
@SenToomey doesn't get to vote. In PA we are pretty sure he's just a figment of our imagination. We've never seen him. Hes Koch butt plug
What a joke! You're not going to vote for ANYTHING the Republicans offer, regardless of what the CBO says!
#KillTheBill  Diane, Do what it takes to stop this madness!!
Yes they know facts will look it so they're trying to avoid them.
Hey sometimes you have to pass a bill just to find out what's in it right?
So stop this.  There's got to b a way. Look into old laws, etc
don't forget "deplorable."
Yes- SO vote NO and reform Obamacare .
Bit the Koch brothers are happy that's who they care about not children seniors the sick or veterans
They are criminals and liars 
It's all about follow the dollar. QUITE PRO QUO. you give me this I'll do that for you. Following the dollar
But the GOP promised to screw up our health care and now they have to do it!
What happened to @SenJohnMcCain request to return to regular order. I guess it was just political bluster. I thought he meant what he said.
give up your taxpayer funded salary, do something for American instead of hate
It's not about healthcare, it's about sucking at the Koch teat and fucking over anything Obama. Get with it Dianne
She's right!  Call your Senators today!
#TrumpRussia  should be only thing on Congress & senates focus right now.
Yes!.....hardly "conservative" from a "conservative" majority 
The CBO is worthless. Like ACA got a great rating for costing the Federal govt aka taxpayer's. Never right yet.
No the Republicans have been sabotaging it
Oh yeah right. All the bad scary things Republicans have done in 9 months versus what like 35 Democrat ruling years.

Please do everything you can to stop this train wreck
And it would certainly not be #RegularOrder. Right, @SenJohnMcCain?
You have described republicans.
Yep you want to distroy our country.
Outrageous that they're trying to bribe Murkowski for her vote by allowing Alaska to keep ACA. This behavior is beyond
It is and shouldn't be allowed under any circumstances !  Policies need to be changed to combat the rogue @GOP the party endangering HC
Yep I am totally with you. Damn Democrats anyway!!!
