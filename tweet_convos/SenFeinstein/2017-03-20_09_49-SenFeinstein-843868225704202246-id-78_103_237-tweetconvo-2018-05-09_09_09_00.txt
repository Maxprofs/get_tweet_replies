nope, your job is to obstruct a stolen SCOTUS seat in the same manner the Republicans did. #MerrickGarland @SenFeinstein
it wasn't a stolen seat they just didn't want another judge who places political ideology over law
like Gorsach? #FOH #TrollMute
obeyed....ALL of them and enforced....ALL of them and interpreted as written ....ALL of them
whether you and i or they like it or not
@SenFeinstein Senator@its obvious this nominee is a terrible right winger. Dems must filibuster or lose in 18 & 20
@SenFeinstein and he will not get this job bcuz it was stolen from President Obama #FilibusterForever
Why even do this? I'm in Cali. STOP HIM, no vote until after hearings about russia hacking! STOP STOP STOP him
@SenFeinstein he is not moderate--he is extreme on women's and worker's rights! Filibuster!!
@SenateDems  Impressed? I encourage you to fully examine his record,cause the past is great indication of the future.
@SenFeinstein I can't believe you are giving Gorsuch a hearing!  Resist! Garland is only legitimate SCOTUS nominee! Stand up!
No, your job is to pander to your constituents by obstructing and bastardizing the process. #obstruction
NO VOTE until the Russian investigation is completed and then no vote for Gorsuch is necessary!!!
@celainesears14 block the nomination until after the Russian investigation
No, your only job is to make sure he is qualified.
Stop being so nice! Stop playing bipartisan! Block this #ilegalscotus nominee! Republicans don't give a shit about Democrats!
@SenateDems I am very afraid that he is not.
@SenFeinstein no your job madam is to ensure he is a qualified candidate and follows the constitution
The Democratic definition of 'mainstream' is if Gorsuch is a liberal.
@JudiciaryDems @SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein do not determine ur vote based on ur liberal leanings.Gorsuch had nothing to do with Garland,dont vote against
Dems definition of mainstream is if Gorsuch will create decisions based on Dem ideology, not written law.
@JudiciaryDems @SenFeinstein
he shouldn't be considered. Today it was inferred 45 was under investigation, no nominee till we have answers
.@JudiciaryDems Honestly @SenFeinstein I don't think they exist anymore.
@SenFeinstein question is, why are the Demoncrats so gungho at circling the wagons to protect a non Dem like Comey hmmm..
@SenFeinstein your job is 2 determine if he will interpret the constitution and avoid legislating from the bench. Yes he will
@SenFeinstein @potus under investigation for possible collusion with enemy state! ALL HEARINGS MUST HALT TILL HE IS CLEARED!
@SenFeinstein No. Your job is to represent the People of California and the US.  Not be a partisan hack.  No better than GOP
@SenFeinstein that does not have anything to do with social justice ,that has to do with the rule of law and constitution
@SenateDems If POTUS colluded with a foreign adversary (Russia) to be elected, are his appointments constitutional? 2/2
@SenateDems The questions are simple: Is it legal for congress not to advise and consent? 1/2
@SenFeinstein Gorsuch is NOT mainstream. His appointment would  SCOTUS into a Corporatist Racist agenda 4 decades.  Vote NO!
This should be a hearing for Merrick Garland not Neil Gorsuch. Our system is failing us.
He has proven over & over that HE IS NOT
@SenateDems he is a nut best suited to the year 1810
Called ur office today, @SenFeinstein. DO NOT allow the seat 2b stolen from Merrick Garland! DO NOT reward gop obstruction. @JudiciaryDems
@SenFeinstein ask him what he thinks about Garland not getting a hearing
@SenateDems Does his impeccable record not indicate he is more than qualified?
No vote for stolen seat. Where is the question here???
all of us who know God abhors the taking of his tiny babies lives, are held hostage to the murderous law that would have the founders SICK!
what you want to reject are those who are most like the LORD and HE will judge you for that Mrs. Feinstein harshly.
do you understand that Jesus was not At all MAINSTREAM in fact he told us NOT to be mainstream but to be righteous! which MOST are not
@SenateDems   This should not be happening while we are investigating Trump and the Russians.
@SenateDems Diane, hasn't he already proven where he is on the reasonableness continium? How much data do you need?
@SenFeinstein Your job is to do everything you can to stop the Republicans from stealing a Supreme Court seat.
We didn't elect Dems to further the GOP agenda! After 8 yrs of Obama giveaways to GOP we've had enough! NO to Gorsuch #SCOTUS
@SenFeinstein Only 10 years on the bench. Not enough experience. We can do better!
NO! Your "job" is to stand up and fight for Democrats! That's what we pay you for. Learn how to beat GOP at their own game.
from the party who thinks no conservative can be mainstream.
Honestly - after DeVos, I have zero faith in these hearings.
MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND #NoGorsuch
@SenFeinstein has done significant damage to the #DNC and should not be trusted by any #Democrat She is unfit for office.
As a concerned US citizen, all hearings should be held off until this Trump/Russian investigation is completed.
There is no Russian/Trump. Dems making it all up because they lost election and want to discredit Trump.Evil
@SenateDems stop wasting our tax dollars vetting someone you know has no business there to begin with
@SenFeinstein OH WHAT BULLSHIT. THIS JUDGE WAS VOTED BY CONGRESS TO BE "THE BEST" WHEN DNC WAS IN CONTROL SUDDENLY A PROBLEM?
The liberal democratic criminals are going to destroy the United States of America
@SenFeinstein Merrick Garland
Doesn't matter. Not Trump's place to appoint him. The nomination was stolen.
@SenFeinstein #FilibusterGorsuch
@SenFeinstein ...GOP obstructionalism. This hearings should have been for Pres. O's nomminee M. Garland!
oh boo hoo, Obama didn't get 3 picks..
@SenFeinstein HE IS NOT!! DO NOT CONFIRM HIM!!!!!!! BLOCK HIM BY ALL MEANS POSSIBLE, DAMN IT!!!!!!!!!!! #NoRepubSCOTUS
#SCOTUS This is so wrong Gorsuch was not picked Garland was.
#He is not
@SenFeinstein Any democrat who enters these hearings with a conciliatory approach is rewarding...
.@JudiciaryDems .@SenFeinstein From what I see, he's not good for women or for fixing voter fraud. Also #45 on way out. He shouldn't choose.
@SenFeinstein He should not be having a hearing in the 1st place much less a vote. This was a stolen seat
. @JudiciaryDems No your job is to obstruct this stolen seat to a Trump appointment.
OK!
