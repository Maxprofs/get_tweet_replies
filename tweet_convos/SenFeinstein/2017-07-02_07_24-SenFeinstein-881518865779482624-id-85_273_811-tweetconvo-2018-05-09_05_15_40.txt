Rid us of the monsters in Washington and Medicaidnwill be saved. First things first.
It would crush all hospitals
Except that there are no cuts. Only a lying, while hag would refer to a $146 billion increase as a cut. So relax Binky, it'll be ok.
You are a woman hater and will be blocked.
I AM A LESBIAN WHO LOVES AND CARES ABOUT WOMEN EVEN THE STRAIGHT WOMEN
Hi. My message was not for you. I don't know how you were included. So sorry. I care about all women, too!
Ps. I was blocking the person you had responded to before me, so your name was tacked on to his. I have to notice these things.
Work with the @POTUS  instead of obstructing the people. Otherwise, U R admitting you're confrmd #DeepState - your constituent
Trump wants #AHCA/#BCRA, which would kill 28,000 Americans per year, because it would give him $80 per person who dies.
Do not attempt to defend Trump, and do not pretend that what Trump wants represents what the public wants.  It isn't.
Less than 1 in 5 Americans expresses approval of #AHCA/#BCRA, and less than 2 in 5 approve of Trump.
Thank you for your strong voice.
PT Barnum had a strong voice, and he also sold bullcrap to people, but at least he did it for entertainment. $146 billion more is not a cut.
Thank you, Senator. My two sons who both have #PreExistingConditions, and I, thank you for standing against @SenateMajLdr's disastrous bill.
I thought you wanted to separate from the union
Replace the whole system with Single Payer and let the market drive savings.
How on earth can a govt controlled monopoly create market driven savings? That is as illogical and ridiculous as it gets...lol.
Government pays, but private drs/labs/hospitals compete for those $s. Think Medicare, not VA
#AHCA/#BCRA would gut Medicaid funding, cutting it in real terms.  It would also kill 28,000 Americans a year: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/06/22/434917/coverage-losses-senate-health-care-bill-result-18100-27700-additional-deaths-2026/ … .
Do not attempt to defend #AHCA/#BCRA or the politicians promoting it.  They want to cause mass death to give rich people tax cuts.
Ask Feinstein why ObamaCare had to steal from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fund itself @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich @StefanMolyneux @CNN
Thank you, Senator, for standing strong on preserving healthcare!

Agree, Senator. We stand with you to defeat Wealthcare.
Could you please #25thAmendmentNow for Trump?  My goodness, we have a demented person as president.  I am one of your constituents.
We need a Town Hall meeting too Senator! When? I'm in Los Angeles.
Dianne Madi cade Is MEDICAL, it is,so abused now it needs to be dropped.  Kill Hospitals?  How? We the insured pay for all the abuse now.
Medicaid needs fixed! Set limits for those that can work. Get a job, get healthcare and benefits! How can you make your Country great?
u are LYING! There is NO CUT TO MEDICAID IN THIS BILL!  SHOW US!! STOP TREATING US LIKE WE R STUPID!
Rid us of the Medical monopolies...Put real cost on care and AMERICANS WILL FIGURE IT OUT for themselves..DON'T NEED DC VERSION
Please this country is so divided. Could we not extend our hand across the isle to someone who is as concerned and try to work together?
HEALTHCARE FUNDING REV VA SCANDAL NEUTRAL USING I.T TO REDUCE COST INCREASE EFFICIENCY & EFFECTIVENESS.
??? DRAWING BLANKS HERE...
True...  @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump but GOP must begin amendment #25 process to remove this unstable and dangerous man from office!
"Gutting"
Thanks for protecting us!
Trump is abusing his power. Must be impeached.
They tried "trickle down" economics which failed. Now they want to try "trickle down" health care.
Medicaid needs to reformed....per capita block grant to States, States adminster the plans, State DHS does eligibility and enrollment
Ma'am be honest for once in your life and tell people they're  not cuts only that increases aren't enough to please you
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMERICA OF Enlightenment Theories written by TJefferson implemented by Congress 1776-2017 HOW We doing?
Thank you for fighting to protect Medicaid!
Cali is crushed b/c liberal economics. Dems. are wasteful. Cali needs economic & social reform, not more money
oh well
Medicaid was doled out like candy by the DEMs during Obamacare.Time to reflect on who should get assistance.Not supportable at present level
The GOP proposal does not gut Medicaid.  Stop lying that it does.  Controlling cost makes sense unless you're irresponsible. Stop overspend.
@SenFeinstein Pls keep pointing out how devastating this bill is. Maybe in way that Repubs under$tand. A sick workforce affects bottom line.
Why don't you try having CA comply with Welfare to Work Act by your favorite Pres.
We need to get ppl off of medicade and back to good jobs that offer healthcare!
Cry like a baby doesn't matter The Train IS Coming @SenFeinstein
Medicaid is unsustainable, its way overdue to be fixed
every hospital and SNF wants a medicare patient vs a cash paying or private ins patient - you ask WHY: its because they RIP OFF THE GOV!
U r such a liar
Check out @kwilli1046's Tweet:
Obama will try & celebrate his "healthcare" success. 36 times Obama lied to us about being able to keep our M.D. RT! 

Define actual cut versus cut in the increase please.
DEATHCARE: kochs = 34BIL TAX CUT • waltons = 53BIL TAX CUT • the children of the orange = 4BIL TAX CUT.... all on the TAXPAYERS DIME....
the kochs are robbing U.S. of our treasure and our ability to take care of the wounds THEY cause....
Agreed! As @maddow has implored us #FOCUS
California has encouraged entrenched govt dependent poverty producing an inordinate burden on taxpayers. Medicaid is pure welfare! Bad...
That's ur fault.   Illegals!!!
What are you going to do with single payer if CA passes? Don't worry Hollywood will support with 80% tax on their income. @retireleo
Nice thought but the tax payers can't afford it.. And why doesn't  Congress have to be on Obama Care?? Tired paying for illegals..
I sent a message to the senator of my state asking for help. That man is scary. He needs to be stopped. What can we do as citizens?
California has over-issued MediCal. It's time for Californians who have the means to buy private insurance.
Louder, the #GOP can't hear you with all the tax cuts they have stuffed in their ears.  Keep providing factual effects these cuts will have!
Medicaid is welfare. Medicaid qualifications included increasing  poverty level line by +200% up to over 300% of FPL. Dependency=Dem voters
Stop paying for illegal aliens welfare, legal defense & medicaid etc . And stop lying about Medicaid, there is No Cut, just lower Increase
Dianne. Per the Red Cross, CA is loosing 1 Hospital per week due to Obamacare.  Anyone who really wants to know call the Red Cross Pomona.
#DontKillYourVoters @SenateGOP #NoTrumpCare
And it would crush special needs programs & disability resources for California's public schools
Yes! I live in a rural area where we are barely hanging on to a hospital. It's a 90 minute drive 2 the next one and no bus
Just when I thought you were becoming reasonable, u say this. How about better management and charging patients a small fee?

get onboard with your constituents #SB562 Single Payer Healthcare. I know you like your Corporate .Now do something historically Good
How, when? Facts only. Re election around the corner. Make America Great Again 
Thank you for speaking out on this--maybe Dems can even come up with a catchy saying conveying this and hang it around the republicans.
Fraud news.. more scare tactics from the Democrats... shame on you Dianne !
Apparently Sen McConnell has just resubmitted new revisions to the CBO for analysis. Do they work on Sunday?
Not just California
