Previous CBO scores of their bills showed up to 32 million losing health care. The new Republican solution is to not wait for another score.
Thank you!
 She IS one of the crooks
You are nuts
You ppl are dense. You dont get it
You sound like a nut job conspiracist seeing nazis everywhere. #Idiot The Cold War is over, Germany is unified lol
How long in your Trump-rage will it take to discover that neither party cares about any of us? Libertarian is the answer
how privileged of you
Really trying to understand your animosity
Repeal the crap we have come on fight for your people
classy reply, Navy Vet 30 yrs.
Senator that's the least of the vote's problems


Pass the show your work bill, lets see whats driving these CBO scores. This could make them more believable.
Run out the clock
How can you prevent a vote?

The CBO analyzed Obamacare and they were off by billions.  Do you really think we believe them?  Wait...you do, don't you???
So let us ALL suffer under Obamacare??? The democrat disaster!! SMDH
Should have done that with Obamacare too

No. If it is so great Congress must get the same healthcare

Seriously how do we know that states will make it "harder" to qualify for nurs home? States mite have more compassion for own folks ??
Of necessity
The plan cuts Medicaid $ yearly so the states will be forced to cut or cover cost from State tax
Real cost will be on taxpayer
Looks that way
Amen! Who signs a contract that had blank spaces where the terms of the contract should be? Just sign they'll fill in the rest later
Do you think that's going to stop them from ramming it through?
@eaglesfanjoe_sr
and let's face it - even with a score you know this bill is garbage
@mms5048 
Just trying2 plow through the untrues of this GrahamCassidy kill bill, the CBO wld probly need 6 mos 2 sort out lies
Does no one recall b4 Ocare we didn't have a federal run health plan other than Medicaide and Medicare? Should've repealed and change rules!
Taking health care out of congress' hands and giving money to the states is guaranteed to save money!  No one can waste as much $ as feds!
@senrobportman aide in Cleveland said it was not possible to have a vote without a CBO score.
Do you seriously need a score to know this bill is horrible for elderly, sick, disabled & poor?
#noGrahamCassidy 
#FundHealthCareNotWar
Thank you senator!
How many times have you voted on bills without having read them? "we have to pass it to see what's in it"
HOW MUCH DID ILLEGITIMATE Trump  others pay u Not to impeach? All him administrative all others steal Install dictatorship?
I HATE PAYING TAXES FOE EVERYTHING PAYING CORRUPTED CONGRESS STEAL OUR $ GIVE NOTHING BACK. ALL TRAITORS THIEVES. U TOO.
Dems seem to only not want a vote when the bill is aimed at Americans.
For sure? @SenFeinstein ?
VOTE FIRST then score like your UnACA

The problem we have, the ACA may have missed it projections, but it was in an attempt to insure the uninsured or previously uninsurable.
FYI cbo did poor job on obamas aca!
Trying to keep us all honest on both sides Love research
Thank you
Respectfully, how often has CBO been correct???
Not great? Is it worth it?
How about not voting at all? Block, delay, do whatever Dems must to delay any vote past 9/30. Come on, play dirty as they are!
Good! Can we stop wasting time with this whole idea of repeal and replace and instead spend the time fixing ACA or is that overly logical?
CBO underscored obamaCare by Billions Annually, why so much confidence in their process, Dianne? Sounds hypocritical
Can't the Rep push the bill through without the CBO scores?
The most basic processes are being avoided because they know the outcome
What was the CBO score for the ever so successful ACA that you supported and is now tanking, bankrupting the taxpayers????
Because Trump's presidency is hanging by a thread, the GOP is terrified they won't get their giant tax cut for the filthy rich. Vote coming.
Also involving the #koch &/or #mercer big money purchase of our country.
No CBA score no vote, at least for reconciliation bills, should be a rule.
be ready to filibuster to stop the shenanigans they plan to force it thru, please
Rp arent good or fair ppl, they're racist and scared ppl, afraid of diversity, the ability to dominate and control is key, they don't care-1
2- They don't care about the CBO they're willing to sacrifice ppl to stay in control, they will destroy the ACA at all costs, no mercy
Help!
ENTIRE GOP HAS NO HONOR. EVERYONE OF THEM INCLUDING FAMILIES NEED TO BE PUT ÒN THIS PLAN. Real death panels. Remember this when you vote
#noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
Right on!
They'll do it anyway. What about McCains so called "order"?
No brainer.
No score no vote and no to the ridiculous GOP.
You can just vote no, even without a score.
so the Republicans are just going to Smuggle this bill threw, typical! Just kill us off and not worry about us, cannot afford!
Dianne,
Last night I dreamt we were dining  & across t/ room was a Crude Loud Hooligan crowd.  Neither We nor t/ waiters could GET THEM OUT
You are not honest with your constituents
If I were paranoid , I'd say this is a conspiracy by & of GOP against the most vulnerable  ppl of the US. Hell-99% of the ppl! #SavetheACA
Vote yes anything is better than Obama Care get the federal government out of my physicals.
3: no one can pay that! They know it. It's murder short and simple for the 99%..stop them please
2: 6 mo. of suffering while a tumor ripped organs apart. Utterly excruciating  pain. W/o insurance cancer cost over 1.6 million!
1: It's #AmericanGenocide we have a fundamental RIGHT TO LIFE! Healthcare should not equate to $$..ACA gave me chemo and pain meds after
Promise that Sen.  please. Plus why should he have the right to push an agenda we demand answers. Enough! You are the boss, lead!
Maybe a law that limits changes to healthcare unless CBO scores reflect benefits?
Unless they'd just find a way to subject that to gamification to hurt people for money.
Dump Obamacare and Feinstein
YES!  Is there Democracy in the US Senate
@weareoversight @RandPaul @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @MikeLeeforUtah @SenAlexander @SenCapito @JerryMoran @senrobportman
I hope
#vote #no #save #aca #again
How is this legal? 
How do we officially change the process?
There's no point.
All of this.
Our country is a laughing stock with Russian hack sitting in our White House. 
Truth must be told.
#Mueller
point? There's 10.4 BILLION on the line that I know of-& that's not even in US- There's plenty of 'point' for those w/plans2profit/Treason
Agreed
10.4 billion?  That was just ONE mirror trade -Ultimately transferred funds to AU where trail was lost (Trade was 19% of Russian Co #Rosneft
Now there's a hashtag, Senator! #NoScoreNoVote
Absolutely agree!
Repubs circumvents protocol for their political partisan agendas they break rules making up new ones if Dems did the same, they'd screamFoul
Agree totally!
#SaveTheACA #NoScoreNoVote #MedicareForAll
And once again those duplicitous bastards try to skate it through without ANY consultation , no CBO, NO GO!!
The avoidance of a CBO score is no coincidence or accident. They're trying to subvert process to kill Americans, in plain English.
Yikes don't think soobamas CBO was way off let's be honest both sides
You have to pass the bill to find out what's in it.. give me a break
#GrahamCassidyNO #NoScoreNoVote 
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the Republican traitors who don't care about America or Americans.
Agree!! Keep up the fight and thank you!
Devastating.
If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
Thank you.
Again, your split-tongue betrays you...!
Actually we already have a pretty good idea of what the score would be
I ask you to do everything in your power to stop this travesty. Each Senator's vote affects everyone in the USA. A solemn responsibility.
So what have you all been doing for 9 months?
#NoScoreNoVote
Just let the yes voters know - I’m a cancer survivor, & I’m listing them under “responsible  party” on all my doctors forms from now on
Please remind them that they are the senators of states, not the damned PACs. And what kind of slime kills people for tax cuts?
I am one of your constituents.  PLEASE vote NO!!!
And here I thought a score was required before voting what the heck?!?
@SenToddYoung No Score, No vote. Will be calling you daily until your office can recite the CBO scores & projections.
Give em hell, DiFi
that's a feature not a bug, Republicans don't want a score because it will be really bad.
@SenRonJohnson Sen Johnson - this how you run your business? Make decisions w/o facts? Easier to just screw ppl out of healthcare yes?
wish you would resign you must hate the American people
We've got to pass it to know what's in it. N. Piglosie

You wouldn't vote for it even if it was the golden deal. Your ideas are outdated and you can't even run your own state.
#no vote#stop
NoThank you from SOUTH CAROLINA. Lindsey has lost his mind.

I urge you to do everything possible to stop this repeal of the ACA Sen Feinstein.
How can you keep the vote from occurring (if there is no CBO score)? Is that a rule, or an "action" by the Democrats?
Please please PLEASE, Senator, find a way to stop this!!!
You need to be in jail
If you and your Left wing liberals ,Clinton, pulosie, Bernie, and many more left this country we will be safe.
Didn't they say they will vote anyway?
Not so sure, but do your best!
No on GrahamCassidy!!!!
Covered California came first but why is it so hard to get a Medi-Cal card?
Boy, do I feel blessed that you and Senator Harris are my senators!
Hope that is true.
@realDonaldTrump Very Unfair !
No score, no regular business! Dems need to shut down all business in progress until Obama care is safe. You work for me. Shut it down.
Why isn't that a law? They are legislating in chaos. This is CRIMINAL
#NoRepeal #TW
We just poured $700 BILLION dollars into the military. We don't have money for that, and we don't have money to repeal without score.
0bamacare is dead thx to democrats
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy you are vile, disgusting people!
Truth? Word? Confirm and I'll tweet it everday all day.
please realize these are extremists who don't care; they're going to try to ram it through anyways. stop being a centrist and FIGHT IT.
Thank you for the info.
KILL THE. BILL
Ask @SenJohnMcCain if this is considered "regular order." Seems to be his only concern.
NO SCORE-NO VOTE!!
Thank you Senator Feinstein for all your hard work :-)
What???
Which of those words is difficult for you Trump troll?
I can translate to Russian for you if that helps :-)
Why don't you translate for Hillary, like go away
how about NO SOUL. NO HEART. NO VOTE!
Thank you Senator! We just want fair play on this.
Let it fail in committee
Totally works for me.
What's to stop them from voting on it w/o CBO?
I remember when McConnell said after Congress did this without CBO he promised U wouldn't vote without CBO
Stop @GrahamCassidy Death March
@botresist -ing now ;)
Thank you!!!
That's an unfortunate slogan, Senator. What happens if there's a score? Don't tell us you're willing to vote for this atrocity.
Why Are Republicans Putting America Through HELL Every Damn Day? TRUMP is A National Disgrace OMG. ..DO SOMETHING
That's great. But these are your colleagues that denied President Obama a SCOTUS appointment. How will you stop them?
Thank you for not voting for this @SenFeinstein!
When you passed Obamacair they did over night and knew it was wrong
Where are you getting this "overnight" bs? Fox? McConnell? It took months! 79 hearings and included CBO score. Enough sound bites. #SaveACA
Sorry elections have consequences. Republicans in charge. Ur opinion is just that- an opinion.



Is there a way to Stop the Vote???
If more pressure goes 2the Reps., from voting on it, w/o a score. I remember b4 most of them, wouldn't vote on it, til the score came out
This is why you cannot do deals on the side. You took your eyes off the ball & they pushed this crappy bill forward. Now step up & stop it!
I can believe hard working citizens of this country have to pay taxes to watch this happen again. It's sick. #GrahamCassidy
Once and for all Washington..put a fork in it
They don't want to give score@lindseygraham  Beacuse they are crooks
Reject! Vote NO
This weekend needs to be a massive march in every major city! Peaceful! Get the coverage and be millions!
Thank you Senator Feinstein, health care is too important to rush through, even if Koch Bros. are pushing you!
It shouldn't be up for a vote. It's morally and ethically corrupt to pass such a bill
Well said. It's absolutely morally and ethically corrupt to even put this bill up for a vote!  #NoScoreNoVote
Can't we just assume it is as bad or worse than the last attempt?  That should be enough.
We do not care what CBO has to say.
Nice job.
Not according to @BillCassidy. He isn't concerned about the "financial aspects" of a full CBO score. But I'll bet bankrupted families will.
He is unethical and a liar
It's APPALLING that a ruinous "healthcare" bill could be voted without the #CBO weighing in and without formal committee hearings
These actions are what it looks like when Democracy is gone No hearings no CBO & over 60% of People don't want ACA replaced They want it fix

Bull shit
Shut down the government!
We are counting on Dem leadership to prevent this bill from passing. Thank you for your patriotic work
Give me hell Senator!!!
@SenatorCollins are you listening?
We don't have anyone else in Republican Party that will stand up for Women & Elderly who will be hurt the worst Not even Essential Care
Red states will take away most if not all essential care benefits. Google essential care benefits. Do you trust GOP w/ your family's health?
Thank you. Please stand tough on this. There is too much at stake.
Thank you senator. This is very stressful for the many women fighting breast cancer who rely on the ACA.
Can any  member of Congress know anything about this bill without the CBO score? Answer: No. Where's a moral compass when you need one?
I with yo on this got to stop it need 60 votes to pass and never do that what for dirty tricks by GOP to pass this
CBO is meaningless.
They fail every single time they "score" a bill.
time to fix or do away with that failed office.
Do everything you can please. I'm legitimately terrified that they will pull this abomination off!
You mean the CBO that told us how wonderful Obamacare would be? Not sure we can trust CBO after that crap!!
Oh boy. You figured out the Republican secret strategy! Hahahaha.
In a fair and just system. But in a system ran by GOP cronies, expect the worst.
He was left with a mess the usual way the demoncrats leave the white house
