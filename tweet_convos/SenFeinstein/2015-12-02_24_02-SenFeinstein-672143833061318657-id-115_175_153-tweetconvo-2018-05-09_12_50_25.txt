@SenFeinstein Worry more about importing Muslim killers with BOMB-MAKING factories in their apartments, not trying to take our guns!
@ValuableWisdom @CzarofFreedom sure you will color this workplace violence even though the two Muslims were armed, trained & shot 30 people!
@SenFeinstein 

Good thing they couldn't defend themselves. You are EVIL.
@SenFeinstein @NRA  Anyone else noticed that these mass shootings happen in states with the most gun control..
@SenFeinstein probably a gun free Zone. U libs are so stupid.
@kiawikiwiki @SenFeinstein isn't it amazing that in countries with gun controls, this doesn't happen,  but it's the liberals who are stupid.
@option53 @kiawikiwiki @SenFeinstein right...cuz Mexico is a fucking paradise.
@theBoringCoder @SenFeinstein We could at least make it harder for them to obtain them.
@theBoringCoder @SenFeinstein So I assume your for more spending on mental health?
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems assault weapons need to be ban everywhere in the USA.  Only police and military.  This needs to stop!!!!
@SenFeinstein its heartbreaking that Liberals like yourself have allowed Muslims in our country to murder us. Men like me will fight them.
@SenFeinstein @jbendery You can thank yourself and the rest of the liberal CA govt for denying people's right to defend themselves.
@SenFeinstein gun control=just as important as change in global politics-btw terrorists inParis didn't useencryption
@SenFeinstein Snowden=right:mass surveillance doesn'tprevent terrorism #SanBernadinoShooting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReQC4Sbs6s …
#NotOneDime RT @SenFeinstein This USA has gone on too long without a commission on false flags; legislate humanity;99% police them selves
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems terrorist attacks fool,
@SenFeinstein and might I add, using guns that you banned. So how's that working out?
@SenFeinstein To provide for Gun-possession and not  to provide for prevention of its  ill-use is nothing short of providing for suicide
@SenFeinstein You, your policies and your associations are allowing terrorism to flourish in the US.
@SenFeinstein You were hired to take action on behalf of the people. Take action. Watching is passive.
@SenFeinstein Your failed policies are no there for all to see. You and your state have banned the very weapons allegedly used in shooting
@SenFeinstein  "you just don't get it" No laws passed will ever keep guns out of the hands of criminals - criminals obey no laws!
@SenFeinstein I bet your drooling over the thought of passing more #Guncontrol  I hear it’s a #Muslim turd!  #BanIslam
@SenFeinstein it's your fault, you helped make the people of your state defenseless.
@SenFeinstein when will members of Congress and Senate go beyond corrupt members who take NRA money. It is in your hands to protect us
@SenFeinstein  To me, it is heartbreaking to hear you leftists always using every crisis to promote your anti-Constitutional agenda.
@SenFeinstein DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
@SenFeinstein Senator, don't you think you should wait for intell on the incident? This does not appear to be your run of the mill inc
@SenFeinstein As a constituent of yours, what specifically are you going to do about #GunViolence? Your heart isn't helping the #victims.
@SenFeinstein people R angry! If Trump does not win, I hear people say there will B a civil war unlike any other. ENDORSE Trump!
@SenFeinstein @jbendery stopped this
@SenFeinstein @jbendery if you'd let people protect themselves from these nuts, instead of making everything gun free zones.they might have
.@SenFeinstein So, will you be introducing legislation? #SanBernadino
@SenFeinstein Tell me little Dianne, why do so many of these keep happening under the Obama regime?
@SenFeinstein please us this as an opportunity to help #disabled! Increase Section 8 funding,&vigorously investigate housing discrimination
@SenFeinstein Don't be heartbroken. Fix CAs gun laws.
@SenFeinstein  that almighty powerful gun lobby u s has.  Potus supposed 2 b so powerful??
@SenFeinstein California is proof that strict gun control doesn't prevent crime. #WakeUpAmerica
@SenFeinstein How about being more then moderately human and work across the aisle to make some changes, instead of just keeping your job?
@SenFeinstein Yes in another #GunFreeZone by #Muslim terrorists. Thx!
@SenFeinstein disarm yourself FIRST Dianne....we will NOT be disarmed...
@SenFeinstein Agreed, especially when it occurs in one of the strictest gun control states in the union. Laws don't work.
@3lincoln9 @SenFeinstein no law prevents crime. Law is imposed to punish those who commit crime. #ManHasAHeartProblem not a gun problem.
@SenFeinstein  this is an act of terrorism in our community! They are not just random gunmen.
@SenFeinstein @search4swag so are you going to fight and propose stringent gun bans and regulations?
@dorothyk98 @search4swag @SenFeinstein Feinstein already has. They either failed or were rescinded later on.
@SenFeinstein without any facts you cannot blame this on "gun violence".
@SenFeinstein With CA's strict gun control laws these kinds of incidents should not happen. Or could the cause be something else? #2A
@SenFeinstein My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those that couldn't protect themselves
@SenFeinstein @ahuntre We're becoming Somalia or Afghanistan thanks to the @GOP and @NRA
.@SenFeinstein So get your ass to Chicago where "gun violence" kills every damned day!
@SenFeinstein do you still think by taking away guns from law abiding citizens that terrorists like these shooters will not have guns?
@SenFeinstein  What is heartbreaking is that because of laws you helped create, there was no way a person could defend themselves there.
@SenFeinstein @nycsouthpaw

Fyi; The history of the area is: Neo-Nazi skinheads. Big time.
http://www.gq.com/story/joseph-hall-murders-neo-nazi-father-story …
@SenFeinstein Why don't you and your colleagues do SOMETHING about it?!?! This is ridiculous!
@SenFeinstein @nycsouthpaw do something about it already
@SenFeinstein @ahuntre #guncontrol New Regs... new requirements... something.
@SenFeinstein Can we get some laws for mental health on the books? we have plenty of gun laws on CA which are obviously ineffective.
@SenFeinstein Paris has gun control and they had a mass shooting WE THE PEOPLE ,ARE NOT DUMB
@SenFeinstein looks like another false flag. our gov't creating chaos for gun control using innocent people to murder for banning guns
@SenFeinstein You have a carry permit! You have armed guards! 
Why are our children educated in Gun Free Zones? GFZ = Safe Zone For Murders
@SenFeinstein @BWheatnyc pass gun control legislation
@SenFeinstein Time to do something
@SenFeinstein -it's unbelievable that our nation is plagued by these mass shootings. This wasn't always the case. What has changed?
.@SenFeinstein @SenateDems That's not "heartbreaking", it's political incompetence.
@SenFeinstein Not surprising. I went to CSUSB and heard gunshots every Saturday night. Gun violence has been out of control there for years.
@SenFeinstein God bless & protect our first responders. Guns don't kill—criminals do. These aren't law-abiding citizens who own guns legally
@SenFeinstein cue the political agenda! Make us bigger targets and weaker people!
@SenFeinstein Very tragic - hope they resolve it quick, and hope that you don't falsely use this for your agendas. #FeinsteinforFuehrer
@GVPrayerWarrior @SenFeinstein yes just like in the Dominican Republic where everyone caries guns but are afraid to walk in the night.idiot!
Hillary blaming youtube video. #Benghazi 
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems @Senate_GOPs Do something instead of letting gun orgs run the Senate&Congress.
@SenFeinstein Its not the time to politicize an issue with family members worried about their loved ones with an active situation.
@SenFeinstein Gun control won't fix this, but you stepping down would be a good start.
And thanks for every single thing you haven't done to even try to stop these things.  @SenFeinstein
@SenFeinstein I am so mad!! Do your job and lobby for gun control!!!Your words mean nothing to me if you wont work for change
@SenFeinstein 
if people were armed, they could defend themselves.
@SenFeinstein @TheCityMaven congress bows to the NRA lobby, this is what you get.
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems this is becoming a daily event. When is enough enough? Something has to be done
@SenFeinstein Then damn it, rally your colleagues and do something about guns! They are a threat to our right to live.
.@SenFeinstein Shouldn’t your pet domestic spying agencies have known about this in advance because that always works.
@SenFeinstein monitoring to see if the suspects meet your favorite narrative otherwise no more will be said.
@SenFeinstein starting to feel like I am living in lawless 3rd world country.  Next we will all be buying Kevlar to protect us from lunatics
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems shut up about "heartbreak" and get your asses in gear & give us gun ownership regulations.  ENOUGH
@SenFeinstein @SenateDems I truly wish we could do something as a society/nation to curb these. But it seems we cant.
@SenFeinstein I'm a gun owner and enjoy shooting but we absolutely need more control on firearms.
@SenFeinstein Until politicians decide that human beings are more important than guns, sadly, these mass shootings will continue.  #horrid
@SusanHaley14 @SenFeinstein Trump was right! Places nowadays need security or armed guards & this mess wouldn't happen as much
@SenFeinstein you have been a tremendous advocate for #gunsense in your career. We need you more than ever
@Sam_Rubinstein @SenFeinstein This isn't a deranged individual - looking more like terrorist action, nothing to do with gun control laws
@SenFeinstein Gun control now.  No more excuses.
@JonStall2009 @SenFeinstein This isn't a deranged individual - looking more like terrorist action, nothing to do with gun control laws
@SenFeinstein more and more frequent. And nobody seems to care.
@ThinkVegas @SenFeinstein This isn't a deranged individual - looking more like terrorist action, nothing to do with gun control laws
