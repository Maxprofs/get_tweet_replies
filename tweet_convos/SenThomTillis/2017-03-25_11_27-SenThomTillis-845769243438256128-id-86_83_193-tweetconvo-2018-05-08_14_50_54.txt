If only they fought as hard defending Americans as they do criminals. @SenThomTillis @FoxNewsOpinion
Merrick. Garland.
Article proves that Dems play MMA vs @SenateGOP play by Marquess of Queensberry rules #ConfirmGorsuch @SkyeShepard @SenThomTillis
Senators should not play politics by holding for 8 months a president's nominee. Tillis is an embarrassment.
I think GOP senators held  Merrick Garland in reserve to see who won POTUS - if Hillary won they would've fast tracked confirmation
Republicans are failing America.
Yeah, that's not true. Gorsuch failed to answer a question. #filibuster
I've seen 20 hour of the hearing and disagree. Democrats are trying to have him prejudge cases...
he's answering zero questions. What are your thoughts on garland?
Why do you side with corporate interests over you constituents? We deserve answers.
Way to be bipartisan.
he's not in yet
#HesNoMerrickGarland @SenateGOP @SenThomTillis
um no. It's not over til it's over.
U sound like petulant children. Is that really how U want us to look at U? Support Gorsuch but do it as adults.
given your Dishonest, anti-America obstruction of last nominee, You shouldn't talk.
Tillis & Fox? Did Napolitano report this?
It's like Republicans have an inferiority complex.
at least they have talked with him and are considering him unlike what you did with Garland
Maybe, but they had nothing to do with the failure of Repubs to repeal Obamacare & help Americans
REPUBLICAN LIE REPUBLICAN B S .
LOL. NO worries.  The Dems have a plan. You guys didn't!
maybe he'll go over big like your health care plan did.
he brought himself down. We know what his record is. He's not confirmed yet.
