@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis how dare you disrespect the 65m ppl who voted for this POTUS in 2012. But then, I guess you always have.
@SamTRicketts @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Respect it earned. Obama has earned NO respect. Thus, he gets none!
@LouisianaEagle its not him that they (and you) are disrespecting, its the American people, who elected him twice.
@SamTRicketts I don't have much respect for the ones that voted for him once, much less twice!
@LouisianaEagle and what a great American you are. Do us all a favor and look up the word "democracy."
@SamTRicketts Being a great American is not believing what YOU want me to believe to thinking like YOU want me to think! That's communism!
@LouisianaEagle no, you fool. It is respecting the legitimate opinions of others, and more importantly respecting the will of the majority.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis In voting for Obama I DO expect to have a voice, as do the majority of Americans that did likewise. #DoYourJob
@cliffier @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The majority also elected a Senate to stop Obama's lawlessness. Accept it!
@LouisianaEagle @cliffier @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis they can vote against nominee but should hold hearing.
@NoDrama999 @LouisianaEagle @cliffier @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Why do we vote for these self centered idiots?
@Stephan99142346 @NoDrama999 @cliffier @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I have no idea why anyone voted for Obozo.
@LouisianaEagle @Stephan99142346 @NoDrama999 @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis And yet most did. EVEN after he was @POTUS for four years!
@cliffier @LouisianaEagle @NoDrama999 @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @POTUS  That's why republicans are falling apart. Not doing their job
@Stephan99142346 @cliffier @NoDrama999 @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @POTUS Dems falling into Socislism and you're falling with them!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis We DO have a voice in the selection of the next JOTSC. That's why we worked to elect Obama.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis the people already voiced their opinion = the man choosing is in the white house...DO YOUR JOB!
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis Disheartened by the ineptitude of NCs leaders. Try solving problems instead of creating strife.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis So does this mean elections will held each time a judge is nominated so the American people can vote?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis you're cowards. Hold hearings. Hold a vote. Reject him. Fine. What are you so afraid of?
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis I already cast my ballot for who I want to pick the next #SCOTUS judge. And he did. Now #DoYourJob!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis the people did have a  live when we electric ed President Obama do your job
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do u even know or understand your job? Do your job
@SenateGOP @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis You guys have gone even further to the nutty. Hope our new POTUS goes way left.
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis This statement is an expression of extreme hypocrisy !  #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis We do want a voice in who becomes our next Supreme Court Judge!  Thank you!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #DoYourJob @POTUS is our voice.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis we don't, we won't.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The people's voice WAS heard, sir: In 2012, when Pres Obama was elected for four FULL years.  Now, DO YOUR JOB!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis the American people had a voice and used it to elect @POTUS and he's done his job.  #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The People selected @BarackObama, TWICE. The People have asked you to #DoYourJob. Have a hearing for Mr. Garrick
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Americans have a say, we elected Pres. Obama 2x and all Senators, now give Garland his hearings and vote!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #SCOTUS The People elected @POTUS in 2 consecutive elections. Hold Hearings. Vote. It's not hard, really.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The People elected @POTUS in 2 consecutive elections. We have spoken, but you don't like what we said! #SCOTUS
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis which provision in the Constitution is the defer provision for up or down vote on SCOTUS nominee?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #DoYourJob & meet with SCOTUS nominee. Stop freeloading off the American people and actually earn your paycheck.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I think you must be drunk.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The American people did have a voice in this decision, when they elected #Obama as the @POTUS
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Even if you succeed all youre doing is giving the choice to Hill/Bernie. Or would you block for another 4 years?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis you are absolutely right! And they used that voice to elect President Obama 3 (and 7) years ago!!! #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 
#DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Fire the Establishment Republicans!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis  THIS IS GOING TO BE THE YEAR OF CLEAN SWEEP. VOTING OUT ALL INCUMBENTS OUT WITH THE OLD.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do your job or step down. Congress is cheating the American people Vote on SCOTUD
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis , we voiced our opinion twice. Do your damn job
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Only ones denying votersâ€™ voice is the gang of obstructionist shitheels about to lose their majority. #tcot
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis if the GOP cares so much about giving Americans a voice- why did they take away so many with voter restrictions?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis GOP has blocked progress for the past 8 years to convince voters that government is broken. The GOP is broken.
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis  IT IS NOT YOUR DECISION TO WITHHOLD THE NOMINATION. FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION, OR BETTER YET, READ IT
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis Democrats aren't thrilled to give the people a voice? Because they are the voice!
@Senate_GOPs @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis I am so sorry, but the people have a voice. @POTUS! Deal with it...
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis the citizens gave their voice to this #scotus choice-they re-elected #potus in overwhelming fashion. Hypocrites.
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do your job and confirm a SCOTUS judge. We will remember this when you're up for re-election.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis -- follow the constitution and do your job!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #DoYourJob Your stance is misguided, hypocritical, and wrong.  We have a duly elected POTUS.
@Senate_GOPs @SenTh Republicans don't want that voice registered by Obama. Give the nominee a hearing and a vote.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis People had a damn voice. Twice. #DoYourDamnJob!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis We did...when we elected this President. :/
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Quit the crap...#DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis stop the pay raise NOW!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis What about the choice the American people made in the last 2 elections? Guess those don't count? @megynkelly
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Reverse logic. With GOP falling apart, you won't have a party left to continue your narrow minded actions.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis STOP THIS!!!! What we want is for you all to STOP  Trump the Racist segregator and  the US embarrassment
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis admit you are wrong,racist,divisive & #DoYourJob  stop making lame excuses or get voted out
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis  you refuse to listen to what we wantit's all a political game to you #DoYourJob  or get voted out!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis And I hope Senate Republicans stop acting political and start acting governmental.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis So in the 4th year of a second term the President can do nothing?
@Senate_GOPs this is pure politics and not at all in line with the constitution.  The people dont pick supreme court judges!
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Your motive is transparent. Are you deaf?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis So  when Hillary nominates Obama for #SCOTUS, you might wish you would have done your job!
#DoYourJob
.@ohdogone @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis That would be sweet revenge :) Garland is the best deal they're gonna get.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The people voted POTUS to nominate and senate to advise & consent. #DoYourJob #UpholdConstitution #SCOTUS
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The President was elected for 8 years, not 7.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis oh yeah and I'm from NC #BunchOfCrap Obama has 4 years.You all are trying to steal the ball. It's #InObamasCourt
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You don't think the people spoke for four years not 3 years and 3 months. You're speaking a  #BunchOfCrap
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis  Any voice, or just the one you want to hear You're clearly not listening to the voters from 2012 election.
@Senate_GOPs  @Tillis we the people have spoken twice we the people are going to take back the White House,The Senate & the House
@Senate_GOPs #Republicans you all are a bunch of Lying Buffoons #God does everything for a reason and He don't make mistakes
@Senate_GOPs #Republicans Senators #You are going to lose the Senate this year and we are going to get what ever we want
@Senate_GOPs #You Republicans cannot get over the fact he is the President and he our BLACK President,#So do Your Damn Job u r going to lse
@Senate_GOPs #Tillis you are one of the most disgusting senators in Washington #The President has an eight year term not a seven year term
@Senate_GOPs #Republicans #you all just don't get it #the America people has spoken #we elected President Obama twice not once but twice
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis hey dudes, we in majority. Stop acting as if you were  in minority. You got esteem issues or something?!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis People's voice herd by all but GOP who didnt like outcome last 2 elections when decide nite 1st inaug 2 obstruct

@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis nice of you all to let @HillaryClinton pick the next Justice #ObamaForSCOTUS
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis DO YOUR JOB
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Which part of article 2 of the  constitution says POTUS can only nominate in 1st three years of 4 Year term?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 
Because winning 2 consecutive presidential elections for a mandate of 8 years is somehow not the people's will?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis  I only ask you make sure the judge is constitutional, not that he be assigned after Obama.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do your job. Review the nominee.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Senator, Democrats are playing you like the spineless puppets you are. Get use to Pres.  CLINTON.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The people have spoken, twice. They elected a President to appoint justices. Per YOUR constitutuion! #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Why don't Republicans accept that Americans made a choice for this #SCOTUS decision in 2012? DO YOUR JOB OR QUIT
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The American people already did.  It happened in 2012...apparently you missed it. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis your job is to #Advise&Consent!  #AllthisGOPobstructionhasmadethemCRAZY!!! Feel like #Trump  #get'emoutofhere!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You don't give a damn about the people and you know it. Stop being giant man babies and do your job.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do you think it's just Democrats? This just goes to show how deeply cloistered & misguided your leadership is.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Americans already had a voice, it just wasn't yours, obstructionists.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 
Hope he stands with the ppl and waits for the next potus to seat scotus.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis someone forgot we had an election in 2012. Now your telling America to hold out for President Trump? #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Unfrickenbelievable that you think this is what majority of Amercans think! You will fail at this! #gopfail
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You DON'T speak for most Americans. Your obstructing our CURRENT President risks setting a dangerous precedent!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis We did when we elected President Obama for the 2nd time
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Us Americans know this is a political ploy and this is another reason we loathe you senators from both sides.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 
If U don't give his nominee a hearing &approve him we, Obama voters, do NOT get a voice. We'll hv been cheated!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Mr. Tillis is for the Constitution except when he is against it...maybe it is time to replace MR. TILLIS.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis No Mr.Tillis we will no accept your lame reasoning to negate the Constitution when it does not fit your desired
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis "deferring consent"?! I am excited to vote out @SenatorBurr this year, and I look forward to you comeuppance too
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Harold just name calls and shouts out hyperbolas speech. He does not try to learn or teach. He seems violent.
@Senate_GOPs The people have spoken. Obama was elected for a second FOUR YEAR (not THREE YEAR) term. Do your jobs already. Shameful.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Obama has proven once again 2 work with the GOP by giving them a version of what they want.ie ACA, deportations.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis that voice is called being elected prez twice with the strongest majority of any election in the last 30 years.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The Constitution,which you claim to love,does NOT say the people vote for SCOTUS. Stop your hatred of America !
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #PullYourHeadout   #DoYourJob  We voted in 2008 2012 for the president! #ReadTheConstitution #SickOfCrap
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis the American people aren't allowed to have a voice because you are obstructing. We want UP OR DOWN votes! #now
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis We did already. We elected Pres. Obama to work for us for 4 years. So #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis We thought u would handle it. That's y we elected u.Obstructing is bad form & gets nothing done. Creepy strategy
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You can't change the truth when you want. I voted for Obama for 4 yr term. Be a leader and meet, discuss / vote
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis   U & ur fellow repubs are negating my '08 vote for 4 more yrs of Obama's successful presidency.   I'm pissed.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis    Will call ACLU Monday morn about a lawsuit, American people vs GOP.
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis - We already spoke in 2012 for a 4 yr term. #DoYourJob. We are paying you to work. Follow the constitution.
I hope @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis will accept that American people spoke 2x. @POTUS serves 4 yrs & deserves respect. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You guys can't really be this bad at math, right? Obama got another 4 years. Not 3, 4. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You are making fun of our American Constitution

 "@POTUS SHALL nominate #SCOTUS ..." 

Shame on all republicans
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis They have voiced their choice. They voted for #Obama Twice. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The people's voice was heard, loud and clear, in 2008 and 2012 when they overwhelmingly elected Obama... TWICE!!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The American's want you to do your job. Give Garland a hearing.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis you are an unfair senator. It is because of you I will change party
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Americans elected a GOP majority in the Senate to stop Obama's agenda, not accommodate it! #SpinelessGOP
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis When will YOU accept that our voices were heard TWICE when we elected Pres. Obama. DO NOT undermine us!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #DoYourJob

@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Senate shall advise & consent on #SCOTUS but the Constitution doesn't say it may withhold or obstruct #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do you understand that the President was elected by the people? He is our voice for 8 more months!!!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis If the Framers intended to give the people a voice in choosing #SCOTUS it would have said so in the Constitution
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Who cares what leftist Dems accept? #DoYourJob & #StandFirm!  No more leftist judges!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The people voted Obama into office in 2012 to a FOUR YEAR TERM. Those 4 years aren't up, yet. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis this argument disingenuous and embarrassing.  Let's admit Dems broke it with Bork and now it's politics.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis You should be ashamed of yourself...you do a horrible disservice to our Country
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis  Can you explain why over 63% support the nomination  and why you guys don't listen?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The American spoke clearly on 2008 and 2012 to elect our president to a 4 year term. Do your job
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Remember that when #Dems win big in Nov. Ignoring their autopsy, #GOP continues its self destructive behaviors.
