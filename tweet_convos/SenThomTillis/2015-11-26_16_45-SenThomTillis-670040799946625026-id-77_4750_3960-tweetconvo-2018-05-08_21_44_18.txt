.@Panthers 11-0 #Panthers, now is the best time to make it all the way #SuperBowl, but #Patriots might be there too like 2004. #KeepPounding
Last #NFLThanksgiving game #CHIvsGB, and be emotional game for #Packers fans as at halftime Brett Farve number retired and Ron Wolf honored.
And almost forgot to mention that what I heard talk on @ESPNRadio be most emotional about this #Packers game is Bart Starr being honored to.
Reason is Bart Stare in September 2014 suffered a stroke, and all he remembers about #Packers is played quarterback there and his number 15.
