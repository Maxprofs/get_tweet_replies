Y'all just don't want to face constituents about your no health care bill. Give everyone affordable health care!
Affordable health care for all is elusive because not practical. Even if everyone pooled $ a health plan, not enough $ for coverage for all!
I've seen a breakdown that says it would, in fact, be cheaper than present plans. And many other countries manage it well.
Which countries?
You are destroying the country and are a horrible representative who refuses to meet with anyone except your rich donors.
#FullRepeal keep the government out of my healthcare!  #FreeMarket #UnitedForFreedom
LISTEN! #REPEALObamacare completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
I think you don't understand how "quotation marks" work.
GOP is not repealing Obamacare. They are keeping it. Reports: Tillis said he blocks DHS nominee until he gets more VISAs to take USA jobs.
The GOP senators like Tillis are in reality progressives & like Dems want to create single payer healthcare & replace American workers. Sick
And allows elected officials to continue to dodge constituents. Face to face town hall?
@SenatorBurr Trumpcare bill can't be fixed. Keep health insurance for 23M Americans, and give no tax breaks to rich. #NeedOverGreed
Please don't sell out Americans by voting for the awful Senate healthcare plan or just a repeal, leaving millions w/out coverage.
Meanwhile, you obstruct....
Yeah like insisting on more H-2b visa workers be  imported. That's pivotal for your globalist agenda. #TillisTheTraitor
Thank you Jacalyn. I couldn't be there, but was with you in spirit. Keep fighting the good fight.
Surely you are voting NO on the healthcare bill tomorrow.  Have you even seen it?  What is in it?  Removing healthcare from millions?
pivotal to doing things like KILLING Americans, inc kids, through immoral health policy for sake of cutting taxes for rich.

Also, DO YOUR JOB!
What things exactly!  We want to know... you don't respond to tweets,  townhalls aren't your thing.  What are YOU afraid of davie? 
Also pivotal: "#CheapLabor" whores like Thom Tillis who betray their fellow citizens should resign or be tossed.

You think wallowing in Trump's mud is OK since it allows you to take healthcare from millions. That is sick.
Free market competition across all states.  Re evaluate eligibility for Medicaid.  Put folks back to work.
Hey! How bout starting impeachment as being pivotal to getting things done. When do you stand up and say ENOUGH!!!!
Do not repeal the ACA! Do not let millions of people lose their health insurance!
You should be slowing down on any Trump agenda items. He's going down and I don't want him taking us with him
Senator, As reported yesterday, Did you block President's nominee for more immigration? Is that true?
Your eagerness to kill my child takes my breath away It's so important to you to kill that you allow Cult45/family to conspire /collude/lie
Vote is schedule for a feys. Stay woke. Vote NO to TAKING 22 MILLION OFF HEALTHCARE. Closing hospitals, kicking elderly out of nursing homes
Also make time for DT Jr. Soon there will be two camps - those who acted and those that did not.
Many AMERICANS will suffer+die if you deregulate #healthcare, destroy the ACA + cut #Medicaid We need a plan like most civilized countries
Stop blockiing @realDonaldTrump  nominate Lee Francis Cissna (https://www.numbersusa.com/ …/sen-tillis-threatens-hold-usci…)
Tillis - do your constituents in NC know that you are obstructing @POTUS agenda as much as @SenSchumer is? SHAME on you! DISGUSTING!
Well - dont get distracted by the Russian stuff
Yeah like get those #Traitors out of the White House. Ur silence makes u #Complicit. Better cancel ur plans, much work to do for AMERICA.
Why haven't you been getting things done before now?
By getting things done, I hope you don't mean taking healthcare away.  I hope you do mean impeachment!!!
Don't act like your doing us a favor by doing your job
Actually I would submit that @SenThomTillis, @SenatorBurr and @virginiafoxx need to use their recess to HOLD TOWN HALL MEETINGS!
Forget reelection unless you stand up against TrumpCare and vote "No" on any non-partisan healthcare bill in this Congress.  We'll remember!
DRIP

#HANG_UM_HIGH
#GOP_PUT_PARTY_B4_PEOPLE
American workers first!!!!
like giving your constituents the shaft by gutting their meaningful access to affordable quality care?
Is this sarcasm?
I sure hope that "getting things done" includes removing known security risks from the White House, and addressing Trump campaign collusion.
I think you meant "doing as much harm as possible" not "getting things done.
Congress created socialist healthcare that is the largest expenditure in the 2017 budget & borrows $1M a minute
Feeling the heat from the folks back home already?
LEADERSHIP IS CRITICAL. You can get a lot done in a short period of time with good leadership.
He would probably rather stay then have another pontoon party out on lake Norman. #RESIST
Not to get bad things done, like GOP draconian "health care" bills. You'd do less damage by going home.
You can't regress the nation if you're on vacation.
.@SenThomTillis Wow! Craven & feckless. You work for us. Face us. We won't be quiet you know. We're not going away. @SuitUpILM
Let it slide unless you plan to #impeachtrump

Better repeal Obamacare now especially if there's a chance the admin will be in flux. We were promised tax cuts, and we want them now!
#SaveOurCare
So taking away medical coverage from millions & appointing horrible justices isn't working out as smoothly as u thought it would
