@Senate_GOPs @JohnCornyn #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs hope you guys don't Scree us out of a Pres Trump and we end up with a dem back in the house. #dontFItup
@Senate_GOPs The People shared their voice in TWO CONSECUTIVE elections - @POTUS got majority twice! New excuse, please.
 @Senate_GOPs .@ChuckGrassley .@JohnCornyn .@KellyAyotte .@lisamurkowski .@SenRonJohnson @LindseyGrahamSC #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs I say let's wait so Hillary and the new Democratic majority appoint one.
.@Senate_GOPs The people exercised their choice back in Nov 2012. What about their voice? http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/03/11/senate-republicans-do-your-job … #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs 24 Republican Senators up for re-election should not vote on any new bill until new senators take office
@Senate_GOPs Senate Republicans cost taxpayers >$1.3million/yr EACH they need to hold hearings on SCOTUS position. Do their job!
What you guys are doing is equivalent of a war crime! The guilty senators who obstruct need to be punished for their crimes!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis we have a voice. That's why we elect senators. You idiot!!!
@Senate_GOPs I wouldn't nominate anyone for anything who has already acted against any part of the Constitution i.e, denying 2nd Amend.
.@Senate_GOPs cant wait to see who Madam President Clinton nominates! #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs The people made their choice in 2012. Do your jobs.
@Senate_GOPs why are you all so dishonest let the people. Decide how stupid do you think American voices are no trust for the government
@Senate_GOPs But WHEN the people decide to vote for a new  democrat president you would still block HER nominee wouldn't you?
@Senate_GOPs @SenOrrinHatch Don't rubber stamp.  Just vote no.  No no no no no no no no.  If necessary, a thousand times no.  Just vote no.
@Senate_GOPs So you are betting that Trump wins ... OMG.  Better chance to get a moderate add to SCOTUS now then with new dem president.
@Senate_GOPs @SenOrrinHatch Nominating is the Executive's Constitutional Duty. It's the Legislature's Duty to have hearings & then a vote.
@Senate_GOPs @SenOrrinHatch Repubicans support FrankenTrump! #VoteTheBumsOut
@Senate_GOPs @SenOrrinHatch AMerica USED OUR VOICES in 2012. YOU get no respect for the voice of 2014, if you don't give it to US for 2012
@Senate_GOPs What is the difference Democrats from the Republicans? Nothing. Pigs. Devour from one trough Fed.
@Senate_GOPs First I want to thank you for the tweets. Second get rid of Trump he's a dictator in the makeing
@Senate_GOPs The People have had their choice in 2008 and again in 2012. It's time you respected that.  You don't have the right to dis us.
@Senate_GOPs @JohnCornyn You aren't doing any advising and consenting, just obstructing for pure politics.
@Senate_GOPs and I thought the constitution said that it was the Senate that voted on the nominee.  When was this changed to an election?
@Senate_GOPs If the nominee is qualified, they must consent.
@Senate_GOPs You fuckbags don't give two shits about 'giving the people a voice.' #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs You are not even holding hearings you are just outright denying them and leaving the seat empty for the longest time in history
@Senate_GOPs are you excited having Trump represent your party!
@Senate_GOPs So stick to it. In the past you have shown us you can't be trusted to do what you say. I hope this changes that
@Senate_GOPs the Book of Life @POTUS is about to open when it does you all fall along with @SenateDems @SecretService @FBI @UN all true too
@Senate_GOPs excuse me, by refusing 2 even meet with nominee is called obstructionism which is all #gop has done for 7 yrs 2 hurt USA #shame
@Senate_GOPs Advise and consent does not mean disrespect and ignore.
@Senate_GOPs have ignored the voice of the people since @POTUS was elected by a majority of Americans 7 years ago.
@Senate_GOPs It is about time. So far Republicans and Obama have not taken the people seriously, have failed us & can take back what we gave
@Senate_GOPs @CaseyKosydor
@Senate_GOPs Hogwash. Our 2012 voice controls until January.
@Senate_GOPs. You are all full of it!
@Senate_GOPs The Senate confirmed John Marshall when John Adams nominated him after losing the election to Jefferson.
@Senate_GOPs Give us what you think are acceptable candidates or qualifications.You don't have to vote. But refusing to talk is not fair.
@Senate_GOPs Nobody's asking you to rubber stamp. That's never been an issue. Stand up and fight for the right nominee. DO SOMETHING!
@Senate_GOPs What part of "advise" don't you understand? You have to consider nominees and communicate what you are looking for. Not refuse.
@Senate_GOPs Give the people a voice you say? When do you plan to start this novel new policy? How about in the primaries? #Trump2016
@Senate_GOPs The Nation voted twice to give President Obama the right to chose @SCOTUS during his term in office #DoYourJob #LiesInDisguise
@Rousan2k1 @Senate_GOPs @Scotus Speek for your ownself, I didnt vote for the tool.  He hasnt done shit as pres. By the way,its "CHOOSE" tool
@RAIDER_R3D every good turn deserves another, Speak not speek I give you a pass 'cause of Boykin.  @POTUS is Pres 'til Jan 2017 #DoYourJob
@Rousan2k1 @POTUS touché!!!  But Obama still sucks!!!  The worst "president" ever, and I mean ever and ever again.  Way over his head!
@RAIDER_R3D @POTUS I am a fan so I don't think that, time will tell.  He is already better than Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush and Bush!!!
@Rousan2k1 @POTUS how?  He has done absolutely nothing except shove his own agenda down our throats! Weak, real weak!
@RAIDER_R3D @POTUS Not civil in DC if you say he is no unifier,I accept. He was reelect so most like it. DEM Majo wrote Health law & banking
@Senate_GOPs @SenTedCruz I agree. Advise/consent negatively.No Bama selection.Bad for America.jan21st coming soon. Bama filibustered nominee
@Senate_GOPs But "advise" doesn't mean advise & "consent" certainly doesn't mean consent, apparently. They had a voice when they elected him
@Senate_GOPs The President used his pen & phone to circumvent Congress.  The Senate controls the hearing schedule and can return the favor.
@Senate_GOPs stick to the constitution and stop trying to deceive folks. Do your job&get off the Hate Obama train.This is America remember.
@Senate_GOPs I believe Mike Lee...the remainder of you Senate Repubs can %#$@ *&%$#& *&*%#@
@Senate_GOPs  Constitutionally, SCourt can operate with only 6. I'll bet at least 6 Justices will last longer than your electability.
@Senate_GOPs @foxnews You mean like they are "letting" us have a voice in the election? I guess WE THE PEOPLE are screwed again.
@Senate_GOPs
@silvarobert718 @Senate_GOPs the fool in there now @POTUS had no experience either, cant you tell????
@RAIDER_R3D @Senate_GOPs @POTUS so I'm assuming you want to go 3-3
