No. There is no "fair." There is no "rigorous." There is either the law & Constitution, or there isn't. You took an oath. Uphold it. PERIOD.
He's a lawmaker, they do this thing called making the laws. It's actually part of the Constitution
What he's doing is suggesting a measure to circumvent the Constitution, to make exceptions to the rules for a certain class.
Uh, no. If his introduced legislation gets the votes to become law then it is not circumventing the Constitution and it's changing the rules
Again, carving out exceptions for classes is UNconstitutional. The 14th Amendment promises equality. This isn't.
For classes? Class has nothing to do with this. And how is this creating inequality? You keep saying it's unconstitutional, prove it
4. Gives non-citizens benefits paid for by citizens. 5. Violates BoR via selective enforcement of law. 6. Google for more.
4. No, it doesn't. Even DACA kids arnt eligible for govt assistance in any way. 5. doesn't violate BoR, it doesn't make them legal 6. No
How 'fair' is it for those who respected our nation's legal path to entry only to have these border jumpers cut in front of them?B specific
By supporting #DACA, you are  protecting America's future. Do we want 800,000 productive young people to leave our country and economy?
How about supporting 800,000 AMERICAN kids who can't afford the path to college!
By supporting #DACA, you are  protecting America's future. Do we want 800,000 productive young people to leave our country and economy?
I support ALL kids who are willing to work hard and respect our country.
We have one already. It's called legal immigration.
That is ambitious.  Can't wait to see it.  In the meantime, continue 2 do your best to protect us from T. He's our greatest national threat.
#NoDACA
That's rich. A Rino with a conservative solution.
Quite sure we'd be better off with you going and @SenThomTillis staying. At least he's not an unstable troll.
Oh look, snowflake unmuted.
Stop publicly fetishizing my pic man. I know you are spanking furiously, but it's making me blush.
You are a complete sellout for cheap labor
... is the path not already rigorous?
you should switch parties to fight the white Nationalist Trump #GOP agenda :)
Literally you're one of the reasons I went from Rep, to Unaffiliated to Dem. and there are a bunch right there with me. #losingvoters
How about start respecting and enforcing the path to legal status already in place first.
Exactly! Hard-working LEGAL Americans have paid $269B for illegals/DACA. Time to care for Legal American families! #EndDACA
You're a bot
Sorry Darrion. I am a human being. Bye Bye troll!
Nothing about letting illegal immigrants stay is conservative
Exactly. What has happened to rule of law?
No thanks dick.

Fuck that. Instead of introducing something people DON'T want, vote YES on #RaiseAct. THAT is what we want, not #amnesty. #America1st!
my thoughts (minus f-bomb) exactly. #ncpol #MAGA
Whatever works and is fair..but please don't send them away!
So people can enter this country illegally and enter your virtual waiting room, work low wages and MAYBE gain citizenship. Change to a Dem
Coming to America and voting for Socialism? What's wrong with staying in one's own Country and making it great?
They freakin leave their socialist countries to come to America only to want it to be a socialist country like the one they fled #Deport
Thank you, Senator, for seeking a solution that's both compassionate and practical.
The compassionate thing to do for Americans is send the whole family home
Fine. But remember, for that family, home is here in the U.S.
Including the parents who brought them here illegally, sorry, really tired of Americans getting pushed aside so we can take care of illegals
Liberal hack!  Illegal is illegal!
In the coming weeks, I'll be introducing the RAC Act, a conservative solution that provides a fair but rigorous path to legal status. (3/4)
NOT interested. I want a ROUND-UP and I want it YESTERDAY
In the coming weeks, he'll push yet another stupid amnesty bill. With Republicans like this, who needs Democrats?
#EndDACA #SendThemBack #BuildTheWall #MAGA
I guess screwing hardworking Americans is more of a priority 4  DCGOP.
Repeal Obamacare & cut taxes.

Do that, you may be in majority in 19.
I see you losing voter support daily.

#EndDACA
@realDonaldTrump
We should love #Dreamers enough to send them OUT of this racist, bigoted, xenophobic, Islamophobic, sexist country that just elected Hitler.
No pathway to legal status period.
Enforce current #Law dont need more #Deport #DeportThemAll #DeportDACA #AmericaFirst #TrustTrump @realDonaldTrump
The conservative solution is not amnesty!!! Maybe U could repeal ACA, build a wall, tax reform, budget, etc.Then we'll talk!!! #NoAmnesty
It's unconstitutional.!!! Any bill you propose is breaking the law.. Now what part of that don't you understand..
#DrainTheSwamp 
There already a "path".  It's called LEGAL IMMIGRATION.
Senator - you should spend more time working for the good of LEGAL residents and US citizens.
NO WE ALREADY HAVE A PATH TO LEGAL CITIZENSHIP they mustve taken a wrong turn somewhere 
#NoILLEGALS
#NoDACA
#BuildThatWall
#DeportThemAll
Conservatives DO NOT REWARD LAW BREAKERS.    PERIOD.  You are going against the will of your constituents.
No thanks.

"illegal immigrants"
#NODACA . Mexico should have its own, DACA!
So you support AMNESTY and you are opposed to the RULE OF LAW!  See you at the next election Senator.
#DrainTheSwamp #RINO #Traitor
Send them home Support American children FIRST 
This will be the 4th time we've said this to you and your donors in the last 12 years...

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT AMNESTY!!!!
No, that's not fair to those who've followed the law! #EndDACAnow
Why not support working class American citizens and fight for their right to attain the American Dream?
I am not sure I want to thank the lobbyists that wrote it
Patriotic Americans oppose amnesty,  Sen. Tillis. You are siding with the Left and Corporations on this issue: true colors.
Your concern should be for legal Americans and not the votes of people that shouldn't vote. Proof your not corageous enough to confront dems
Once again the GOP hucksters would rather kill their careers than see America made great again. Sad!
Hope u are reading ur tweets. God wants us to take care of our God-given possessions. Illegals are like an Ishmael, not ours. R u listening?
What do you get out of groveling to the left. Is getting a pat on the head from the liberal media worth losing your Senate seat.
Don't Bother. One called RAISE is there, get behind it! #EndDACA Americans had DREAMS too, and we want them Back @realDonaldTrump
Americans are sick & tired of PC pandering. FOLLOW THE LAW. Deport them all now! It's not complicated. Listen to the people who elected you!
..."I only root for the Latino countries." she replied. Dreamers DO NOT love the US. They are loyal to Mexico primarily. NO.
& the #American people are watching you. Your names will be noted when you once again vote against #AmericaFirst in favor of leeches!
Young waitress at a Mexican restaurant.....I asked her "So you rooting for the US in the World Cup?" She said "No, I never root for US".....
Hell no. Say no to the RAC Act. Legal status will eventually lead to citizenship for those who do not even love this country
How about sending them back and make them apply like all those who come here legally?
While reducing the number of legal immigrants we accept each year, from all sources derived, to 50,000.
Seriously??? Introduce something to help AMERICANS. Repeal and replace Obamacare. We can't buy insurance in our county since Dec of last yr!
Yeah, Reagan fell victim to that crap in the 80s. We are not interested.
SUPPORT OUR POTUS, AMERICANS ELECTED HIM FOR HIS POLICIES.  RINOS will lose in their GOP primaries, we are FED UP.
No amnesty! #EndDACA
Thank you, Senator!
NO!!! No amnesty under any conditions. Deport all illegals. Period.
FUND THE WALL
Nothing you do is fair or legal
Unfortunately NC will be stuck with the newly elected liar for some time
How a rigorous path for Citizen children to have a future!! What a novel concept!!
Just NO!!
Maybe you should run as a Dem next time
Noooo!! The GOP has to keep him for all the harm he's done to NC.
Tax reform and healthcare FIRST !!!!!
Why do you think this a good idea, cuck? #CuckThom
For "dreamers" only, or for their parents and other relatives, or illegal immigrants in general?? What about e-verify, or visa overstays??
Your constituents don't want that! Who are you really working for here?
Imagine how many jobs a year Americans lose to illegal aliens, I remember moms working at hotels, restaurants,  now illegals have it.
And your constituents will crucify you. I swear to god, have you people not been listening to the American people?
Stop with the demographic displacement of the native population.
LEGAL PATH starts with LEGAL ENTRY
Nothing more, nothing less.
#TheLAW remember when it was relevant? + JUSTICE was BLIND?
Big difference between "legal status" & "path to citizenship. NO citizenship ever for illegal entry  without leaving & starting over.
Vote out every single Republican Jackal that is Anti American enough to support this illegal alien pushing joke!
Americans don't want DACA to continue or amnesty for them.  They are illegal - it's against the law PERIOD--follow the law or out.

Blah blah blah blah blah. We don't want your hawking.
I live in NC, you are a traitor and a liar. Never voting for you again. Life long GOP here!
The only true conservative solution is SEND THEM BACK. Anything else is the swamp
Deport them. They can then follow our laws for legal immigration. Nothing else is acceptable.
Here's an idea, Build the wall, stop illegal immigration and then lets talk about Amnesty.  But you don't support enforcement, 'cause CoC $$
Yeah, "Conservative" Amnesty &  supported by liberal Democrats.
Tillis taking more money from globalist lobbyists again...
What a sad disappointment you are. You're no Republican. Why don't you run as DemocRAT?
Still not good enough for the Klansmen in your party.
No. Obama broke law and you enabled him! Get rid of DACA and stop lying about this. These people are adults not children!
Am I not a child?
No.
Go do old people stuff like spend time with your grandchildren, bake some cookies or worry about dying soon :)
SMH! With that kind of attitude why would I support anyone under DACA. You are disrespectful and want to destroy our country. Prove my point
Yoooooo chill mam LMAOOO let's go drink some tea and discuss this topic. I never said I wanted to destroy this country
You disrespect is destroying our country. If you can't respect its citizens you don't belong here.
Stand for AMERICANS first!!
This is what you spend your time on, instead of issues helping Americans? Just looked at your record, you have done nothing have You?
Get rid of this bozo. Next primary support anybody but this guy.
Illegals do not deserve legal path to citizenship.@AnnCoulter @va_shiva @mitchellvii @billoreilly @TuckerCarlson @floridaguy267 @POTUS #MAGA
Oh no.  I hate RINOs.  We will vote you out.
Go away.
Nothing conservative about it.  How did N.C. get to the point where it is electing RINOs.?
There is nothing Conservative about rewarding illegal behavior. Or with rewarding a criminal with the objective of their crime. #resign
What part of "No Amnesty" are you not getting?

Pay attention! We the people are not ok with amnesty for any illegals! Young or old! We want you to protect american jobs n $ for Americans!
deport Tillis first
f that
I can't vote for your opponent but I have family that can. I'll donate to your opponent
So you'll be pushing #amnesty. If you can't be honest about what it is, why should people believe you on anything? #Deport #EndDACA
The "conservative" solution is following the law.  But good to know you are pro America Last.
America needs infrastructure and tax reform not more people. Take care of the citizens first. Trump msg was simple and proving it was needed
Will this "conservative solution" include any limits on legal immigration or will it be another Chamber of Commerce open borders bill?
Thanks for being a fraud. I live in CA but supported your campaign. Not the next time.
#EndDACAnow #EndDACA and pass to end Obamanation health care please!! #America1st not! Illegals backdoor first! Parents R using kids 
I'm going to dedicate every day to educating the people of your state on your betrayal of the will of the people. #MAGA #AmnestyThomaTillis
The average age of DACA recipient is 26. This is amnesty prepare to be primaried. #MAGA
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.
ATTENTION ALL REPUBLICAN VOTERS. REPUBLICAN RINO SENATOR TILLIS IS INTRODUCING A BILL TO "FIRE AMERICANS 1ST" AND REPLACE YOU WITH ILLEGALS

Amnesty and you're out. It's that simple.
Great will wait and see
RINO "solutions" are not solutions they are sellouts. What about all the people in line that are already doing this the legal way?
You are a bought & paid for member of the anti-American Uni-Party. You work only for your special interest benefactors. 
Join the Dems if amnesty is what u represent. Do U not understand ILLEGAL!
Why are you working so hard ON THE BEHALF OF NON-CITIZENS while IGNORING THE NEEDS OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS? ...Who elected you???
Resign. You've betrayed America and your race.
America's children look like this.
#Recognize #Deport
How about fuck no.
First all illegals get DEPORTED , so they can try it again legally after paying a substantial fine, for scamming our system.
In other words.... Amnesty, which we didn't put you into DC to pass. Let @POTUS end illegally enacted DACA and it will sort itself out.
Go become a democrat already! We didn't vote for your Rino politics, you are almost as bad as McCain.

The two paths we need are to send the illegals back to their country and to vote you out of office.
