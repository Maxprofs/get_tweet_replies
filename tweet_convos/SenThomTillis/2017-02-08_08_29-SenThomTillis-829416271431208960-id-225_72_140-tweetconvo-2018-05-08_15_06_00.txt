and there is a reason for this .. #SwampCabinet
@SenThomTillis If you want to see historic, look at how @RoyCooperNC is being treated. Chosen by NC, obstructed by @NCGOP.
@SenThomTillis Oh, more historic than the way the GOP paved for @POTUS44? People died waiting for their nominations. No SCOTUS...
That's because they are neanderthals, and their knuckles are dragging
Historic degree? Didn't the government shut down a few years back because of the GOP?
perhaps Trump should not have picked a bunch of unqualified Wall Street execs
Every one has a shady past or is not qualified. It's like the "practice squad" taking field.
@SenThomTillis Senate Dems- keep up the good fight. You obviously know what the people want. Thank you.
as a Republican I objected to @HillaryClinton use of word DEPLORABLE but these picks have me using it daily. sad...
Because  his Cabinet nominees are historically unqualified.
blah blah blah wah wah wah.
hey look! We could have Jon Smith as our new DoE head, seems to have a similar intellect as DeVos
Would be glad to so I could straighten the school system up!! We would go old school!!
Right, because Senate Repubs never blocked anything.  Trump is a traitor.
@SenThomTillis Ease your conscience off of Twitter, and think of your constituents every time you spend a DeVos $. God bless you.
@SenThomTillis And you claim to head a bi-partisan committee. You've lost your soul in DC. Bless your heart @SenThomTillis.
@SenThomTillis Trying to clear your conscience after accepting bribes and betraying NC? Gross. You're just another Burr.
Trump's choices are not good.  And I say that as a Republican.
We can certainly strive to vote out obstructing politicians who don't have American interests at heart
amen! The Dems plan on doing our best.
As a Republican I am ashamed of the GOP and all it has come to stand for.  You are all traitors to the US.
Should they not?  So many nominees are so clearly unqualified.  Where is your sense of truth
and rightly so.
if it was filled with qualified candidates, they might run!
Well, bullsith and fake reality.  When you act #cowardly facts can be tough to understand
Or @POTUS choices have all kinds of ethics issues.  And I say that as a Republican.
@SenThomTillis you want to know what your constituents think? Read this thread that you left your name off of. Come see us in RTP
@SenThomTillis The people of NC are frankly, pissed. You sold us out. Your constituents will always remember. - Resident of NC
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico Short memories, eh?
In most cases I'm glad that they are.  I hope you are following conscience, not politics.
keep up good work
They shoud be.  This is the biggest bunch of unqualified clowns our country has ever seen.  GOP is ðŸ–“
Yes. It's what people do when they have consciences. We #resist. We #ResistandPersist. We won't forget. 

@SenateGOP @SenateDems @politico
Citizens have voiced their concerns. We've told our reps to say NO to all unqualified/pay-to-play picks.
@GOP It's funny how facts make u all look like fools. @SenateDems obstruct bc we asked them to. https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/obama-has-waited-longer-for-cabinet-confirmations-than-any-other-recent-president/ â€¦
love facts!
Maybe they have a good reason. Maybe you should listen to your constituents instead of the almighty $.
Not true- Obama's took longer
Good!
disgraceful that you retweet this after failing your constituents on #DeVosVote big time.
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico you all will be going home b4 Sessions nom is cold. Prepare for a rough ride, racists!
@SenThomTillis Maybe if they weren't unqualified hacks hostile to the very agency they're supposed to oversee (i.e.destroy) ...
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico Because that cabinet is all wrong? If you put decent people they'll confirm them -_-
because this is the worst Cabinet ever proposed. Why not recommend qualified ppl to Trump?
@realDonaldTrump @HouseDemocrats @seanhannity We knew there would be push-back on everything. Its ok. He's in.
Are these nominees the best you can do?
They will be completely voted out each and every election!
You sold out every public school child in America! How do you sleep at night? #fascists #traitors
They should! Most #corrupt administration ever and u r guilty by association. #NoSoul #fascistGOP #traitors
Good!
Didn't Obama's take longer.  It is what I have read.  Can you clarify?  Thank you.
Be 11th hour heroes. It's not too late, show integrity #BeHistoric #StopSessions
Get used to it.
Sessions opposes Violence Against Women Act. Will the GOP be like Russia or #BeHistoric?
Bannon: Sessions  â€œclearinghouse for policy and philosophy' in Trumpâ€™s admin" #StopSessions
Slow walking gives GOP time to find conscience. You still can #BeHistoric #StopSessions
Go Dems! Resist the morally bankrupt GOP! PERSIST!
Because you are letting them. You don't have the courage to fight back. Schedule the votes. If dems don't show, vote around them.
@SenThomTillis Hey Thom, speaking of obstruction, when is that hearing for Merrick Garland scheduled?  Hypocrisy on steroids.
Rep.Senate Mitch MC leader on day 1 Presd Obama in Office said he try 100perct to see him Fail Racist Mitch
Senate Republicans are Trump puppets.  Trump's cabinet picks are historically wrong.
you can try to quiet the dissent there but we will continue to call out your BS!! Fire Congress!!! Incompetent.
The most incompetent, racist, and financially corrupt cabinet in modern history? Yeah, Dems had better try to obstruct it.
Republicans are in control. Nominees refuse to submit ethics paperwork - where are your spines?
MOST corrupt and most unqualified Cabinet ever!
gosh Thom, what a contrast to the historic level of cooperation you extended to Obama!
Maybe if they weren't racist, incompetent, and/ or corrupt, this wouldn't happen. Do better & you'll be supported
as they should. Look who we are dealing with. Plus, 8 years of total obstruction even when you agreed.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr the GOP's agenda for the past years was to obstruct!
that cuz all trumps picks r dumb raciest and without morals
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico  well since it's the anticabinet that would be a good thing.  How's that $72,000 thom?
WRONG @SenateGOP Check your facts. #NotAltFacts
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico Republicans never forget!  How is the Republican nuclear action working for the Democrats?
for wanting these positions  for that reason.
hate the department they've been asked to lead. Who did this? Rebekah Mercer? These ppl need extra scrutiny
like this whole administration has been. You want to blame that on Democrats? Typical GOP. MOST nominees
@SenThomTillis His nominees are grossly unqualified and you're ignoring calls from thousands of constituents- thx from GSO
These Cabinet choices were NOT properly vetted when brought for hearings. Paperwork not available. A mess
Just like you slow-walked Merrick Garlandâ€™s SCOTUS nomination. Tit for tat, bitches. //@senatedems
Your historic slap in the face of a female Senator for READING A LETTER will not be forgotten, or forgiven
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico this is a lie, anyway.
And @SenateGOP is #RubberStamp all the unqualified nominees while participating in pay to play politics
@SenThomTillis @SenateDems @politico Someday payback will be a b**ch. Wait until we do this to them
@SenThomTillis As NC GOP attempts to strip Gov. Cooper's ability to appoint his Cabinet.
Warren was speaking to a Trump nominee not a Senator in this regard!
if transaction team had been ready on day 1 & all nominees filed required documents, wouldn't B so long.
Maybe GOP should notice the huge amount of resistance from all citizens to DT policies.
This exposes why nothing was getting done in Washington! It was never congress!
the picks are awful. @GOP policies only benefit millionaires and corporations.

republicans are a bunch of #racist #bigots
there are REASONS for that.  Good god!
delay is due to bad nominees #youvotedyesonDevoswewillvotnoonyou
you damn republicans are railroading through unfit and unqualified nominees. But then you are all unfit too
It would have helped had nominees not needed so much time to divest of potential corporate conflicts
So in the end, as they say, THE BUCK STOPS HERE. POTUS is to blame-NOT DEMS
By Jan 20, he not only chose just a handful, none of them had required docs
Because he was clueless, he only nominated a handful by January 20
because they are completely unqualified. America is not fooled for long, incompetence will out.
Your support of devos is criminal. You filled me with hate. I've worked hard to get back to center. Try it
Pay attention: POTUS chose nominees at a snail's pace because he was clueless
I don't count Gorsuch in that group.
If your president wasn't selecting nominees who have fought/sued the agencies assigned, they wouldn't drag
Hopefully, the walk is toward the door.
communists
your unwavering support of these candidates is disappointing
We need to stop Democrats from obstructive behavior 
GOP R  nice to Democrats 
We the people want action
Laws R need it to stop Judges who R not Elected to revoke  the Senate or President decision
GOP IS THE PARTY OF BLATANT UNREPENTANT HYPOCRISY. Life long GOP here - no more. Graft by Oligarchs Party
yeah bc the candidates are scary unqualified or do not appear to have America's best interests at heart.
How soon you would like us to forget that you OBSTRUCTED Obama for 8 years.

â€œI hope and believe... the president will realize that he has to establish some [bipartisan] relationships," McCain said."
well ya slow walked sorry you ignored obama nom for scotus. i support the dems and im a #libertarian
BC they are all losers
Why should dems make anything easy for the right?  The way you all treated Pres Obama was horrifying!
Rich coming from the party that failed to hold an interview or hearing on SCOTUS nominee for over a year
grows some balls and slap these idiots around. Some day they'll need cooperation.
THANK YOU, DEMS. 2018 will bring back the light. GOP will be sorry.  We shall over come.
Does the name Garland mean anything to you ? You reap what you sow as any Christian knows.
dems are communists for several decades. I wonder when they will call for civil war 2?
after all, slaver dems started civil war 1 !
and Senate Republicans are allowing them to do so.
BECAUSE YOU FAST WALKED NOMS WITHOUT PROPER VETTING & REFUSED TO ALLOW PROPER QUESTIONING!
bitterness of defeat, ain't it sweet
good. Eat one thousand dicks.
His picks are grossly unqualified, and even dangerous. It's necessary.
very very angry over this!   We will remember!
because their constituents are telling them to. Do you forget why you're a senator???
good for them!  Dems should show same support and courtesy GOP showed for 8 years.  #stopwhining
Good, the slower the march to fascism and racism, the better.
Don't forget if, heaven forbid, their time comes again.
Short memory?  You refused to vote on a Supreme Court nominee at all.
probably because Trump's cabinet is corrupt and unqualified to a historic degree.
bring that up every time any Republican does interview & state danger empty cabinet poses.
And to an even more historic degree these nominees were either unqualified or corrupt or both #resist
Mitch McConnell needs to say 'enough is enough' and give this country an attorney general!
REALLY! many pics unqualified RU 4GETTING M GARLAND?!? 7yrs, was Obamas choice FU
Proud of deems for putting the interests of the American ppl before their wallets.
nope just using extreme vetting, you know, the kind you guys like. Cry me a river, losers.
this is the party of corruption!
not slow walking, protecting our country from the swamp!
@TheDemocrats are being led to slaughter by their socialist wing in 2018
Trump's approval ratings are historically low, and 2018 is only 2 years away. Wake up!
Trump's nominees are shockingly unqualified.  OGE paperwork incomplete.  Nominees tell lies during hearings
least qualified, most under vetted cabinet selections in history. That's your story
Bank bigot! Only buy! Simple:France on the blacks side! Teach proper! Bigotry budget fails! All #Italy Â©â„¢Â®
Rochford is a junkie. Drug trafficking cell.Consumers died! No one use heroine! making customers via AFT
Could be because @SenateDems know Trump's candidates are highly unqualified. #GOPDestroysAmerica #LetLizSpeak @politico
America HAD ENOUGH of #DEMS ABUSE & KICKED U OUT frm Local 2WH & @SenateDems on OUR Tax $$ turn ANARCHIST now? STOP IT @politico
Yup. And for good reason. Too bad you all can't figure out what it is. #Resist
It's because NONE of the cabinet picks are appropriate for the position. #GrandOppressiveParty
really?! A group of unqualified billionaires who haven't been vetted with conflicts of interest. That's why
Remember how they passed Obamacare? Why not follow that model?
Republicans taught us the true meaning of obstruction. what goes around comes around
The follow the heard and pay for play must stop. We need independent thinkers that represent ALL Americans
Someone's got to do it since they are such horrible representatives of the human race!
when the GOP tweets something out, do u even bother to listen to feedback from the ppl? Oh wait, no.
Haven't the Demorats learned yet?  What goes around.....
Fantastic! Trump should pick better nominees then. Americans deserve best-of-best candidates - not trash!
Tell me again how you care so much you just ban speakers from talking. Pitiful and disgraceful move. @SenWarren
This is because they are historically inexperienced questionable billionaires.  Betsy confirmed really?
Good.  Many of them are unqualified disasters.  If they were all Mattis, it would be a different story.
Yes, so you have no time to gut the ACA, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, public ed, women's health.
GOP best take control of these obstructive Dems & force clotures 24/7 daily & get all Cabinet confirmed
NEWS FLASH! CNN poll says 77% disapproval rating for Congress. I would be FIRED if my job rating was that!
By the way, this is NOT fake news. See Real Clear Politics poll.
ps it worked for you what goes around comes around
Cassandra Butts, who Obama appointed to be Ambassador to the Bahamas. She died while waiting 830 days thanks to @SenTomCotton.
do democrats and soros want civil war here?  scary times
Slowing as opposed to not even agreeing to meet with Obama's Supreme Court nominee. You are NOT the victims
.@SenateGOP @SenateDems @politico I don't think you have to worry. Ur obstruction of Obama's qualified people will still be longer.
Demonstrably false. Obama didn't have cabinet until April. Trump's cabinet is the most unqualified #ShePersisted
Time to move on without them! Get it done!
good!
THERE MUST BE LAWS TO PREVENT THIS "OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE"! WE NEED OUR CABINET TO RUN GOVT @POTUS PATIENT
Says the party that wrote the playbook on obstruction. Next time nominate qualified candidates.
duh duh duh blah blah blah wah wah
They are doing a better job than you guys.  
That's because they are unqualified and conflicted to a historic degree.  #GOPwinAtAnyCost
This is, as to be expected by @SenateGOP, demonstrably false.
This, of course, is demonstrably false. Clinton didn't have Cabinet in place until March 11. George HW was March 17. Obama not till April 28 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829133645055135750 â€¦
probably because the cabinet picks were unqualified and corrupt to a historic degree
as they shld. Most corrupt and unqualified cabinet nominees in history!!! GOP obstructed for YRS #SuckItUp
blah blah blah wah wah wah sob sob ugh!!
