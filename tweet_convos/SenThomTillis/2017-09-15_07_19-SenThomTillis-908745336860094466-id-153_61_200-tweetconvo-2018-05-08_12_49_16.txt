Keep sending them to die and be scarred for life in your "political wars." After Nam, I will never trust you poliicians...never.
Wish they would capture u McConnell. You stole Supreme Court Seat and prevented Obama from bringing Russia cyber attacks into public focus
Yea but what are you doing to help those veterans with #RepealObamaCare and are you interested in #TaxReform @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
KY - Mitch is getting ready to sell your healthcare funding to another state. Tell him no on CassidyGrahamTrumpcare.

@CNN @MSNBC @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan @SenDeanHeller @SenTedCruz @RandPaul @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC @JeffFlake @ussenate @TGowdySC
Is your vision the only reason you were discharged from the military?

My grandfather. RIP 

@SenateMajLdr continues to allow Trump/WH to violate constitutions Emoluments Clause.

Please you guys need to do your jobs! #taxreform!
Shame on you, McConnell!  You have lost our respect!  You DO NOT have the best interest for Americans first - must be $$
You have no right to the flag.  You are a traitor and the reason we are a failed democracy.
Enough with LEADER McConnell #DitchMitch
Appreciate the sentiment. But you need to back President Trump's agenda. It is also my agenda. And I vote.
We all do. At least in my house. And we don't support racists
And neither do I, madame. Of any color.
@potus is a liar, mobster, racist, rapist and traitor @houseGOP @senateGOP @GOP we all know, world leaders know. YOU know enough to #impeach
Please do your jobs! #healthcare
Or as @realDonaldTrump calls them, "Not heroes".
Yeah the US taxpayers by Washington
And yet you support someone who mocked that sacrifice in the most obscene way possible
Please do your job! #security
We need legislation to unseal POW-MIA records from Vietnam War. Americans need to know who was on our side, who colluded.
Drain the Swamp!!!!
Mitch the dick
Why don't you compensate all of those poisoned by the water at Camp Lejeune? You care more about illegal aliens.
Today we want to remind you that you are on your way out.. we have had enough of your shit.
18% approval rating that's too high for you.
Whew! I thought you meant how the GOP has taken the American people hostage on behalf of the 1%
#resist #tRUMPcrimeFamily FASCIST Domestic Terrorists & Co-Conspirators #TrumpRussia
They are not really "wanted" by anyone. More like they are legally forced on *most* Americans.
How about the unbelievable hardships endured by the American people as a result of your impotenceGet out of the way you traitor #filibuster
the president you support isn't a fan
@realDonaldTrump #trump #POWMIARecognitionDay #POWMIA #pow

There have been clear violations of the law with regard to Michael Flynn. #AMR

The fake president you support doesn't like people who have been captured - he says they aren't heroes.
Well, all the those not named Trump especially the 5 time draft dodging orange butt plug, right Mitchy?
Oh, BTW donny blamed auto correct on Twitter.  I did not know twitter came with spell check.
Don't you proofread? You and your master are not masters of constructing a sentence. Get w/De Vos she can MAYBE teach you. #EAEWO
@SenThomTillis 

Trumppuppet, I'm sorry you are the majority leader, you are a sorry leader. Resign.
Actually, we are reminded of a nation presently held captive by dirtbags. SHAME ON YOU. SHAME ON YOU ALL!
This is, again, authoritarian. Trump is using the power of the presidency to attack a private company because their employee criticized him. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908651641943003136 …
According to our fearless leader, they aren't heroes. Just ask Senator John McCain.
Maybe I missed Trump's recognition of these brave men and women????

Go lay down grandpa.
We don't  need reminding. Obviously you do.
What did Trump say abt POW's?  Oh, yeah, now I remember.
Remind @POTUS to be respectful. @realDonaldTrump prefers those who were not captive like @SenJohnMcCain.
Those taken captive by their enemy is YOU SIR! 
You have taken Trump captive! We voted Trump in... 
and WE CAN VOTE YOU OUT!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO0mHEJyC3Y&feature=youtu.be …
Don't add insult to injury by voting to repeal the ACA.
You mean the men and women, like @SenJohnMcCain that @POTUS said was not a hero?
Some of these ppl u pretend to "honor" came here as children , brought by parents, who have been demonized by u and the @SenateRPC @POTUS
Did you name a post office too.
PLEASE fulfill your promises and move Trump agenda-end the filibuster like Dems would
As you sentence America to hell by backing islam/DACA....hypocrite
You need a Twitter copy editor. Please reread and repost
I feel like you Republicans have taken the country captive and won't be happy until you've ruined it and us while you all get richer.
Another reminder that @SenJohnMcCain is a traitor.
The President you support prefers people who don't get captured.  Whose side are you on, anyway?
And we will honor them by fighting against the removal of freedoms they fought to protect... right?
your fellow kentuckians need to hang u from a very tall tree!
But your Dear Leader prefers people who weren't captured.
This includes no citizens who served please get Congress to move forward on road to citizenship
"Maj Speaker McConnell - the most unpatriotic." HRC--AGREE!
Yet you support TRUMP who insults them
If you cared about our troops you'd allow a vote to protect them all, but you don't because you're a partisan twatrocket.
Nice turn of phrase.
Listen to US warriors in Syria. Politicians more or less seem to be inept.
We need your help & guidance to work w/ POTUS on tax reform, affordable ins, infrastructure & the wall. Pls do what's right for us all.
We are counting on you sir. Ignore all the haters. This is your chance to rally the Senate and make a stand for American PPL. Work w/POTUS
You are very slow pls retire soon and let young republicans that can keep up with The Don! We are watching you! Trump2020 and forever.......
Get behind & support the President's agenda ..change the 60 vote rule...simple majority!!
GOD BLESS OUR MILITARY WHO ARE #DREAMERS 
Amen! 
They are bravely doing what TRUMP lied to avoid doing.
@SenateMajLdr our current @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump called a prisoner of war, @SenJohnMcCain a LOSER for beinga POW. #NeverForget #25the45th
Trump insulted Mr McCains service to our Country. He made a negative comment about POWs.
GOP should be ashamed at Trumps negative comments about Mr McCain and POWs.    
 @RepAndyBiggsAZ @JeffFlake @RepTrentFranks @RepGosar
#fireMitchMcConnell
Get with our problems and stop playing politics. I am sick of YOU. Immigration, Healthcare, TaxReform, NKorea, Iran, Budget, ISIS.Priorities
You must be talking about the middle class tax payer there Mitch !
Guess you failed English 101
Hows the wall coming?  Tax reform?  Etc?
And you want  to help them by taking away their healthcare
McConnell is so full of gas. You can't believe anything that he says
Too bad POTUS doesn’t feel the same way about our heroes who are captured.
Yes good to remember those but you really need to get to work on things like healthcare! MAGA you swamp monster!
Remember when your party's leader insulted POWs? I do.
What would we do without "leaders" to pander to potential voters and donors by reminding us of the bleeding obvious?
Then why dont you make your actions fit your words? Go ahead.. I'll wait! #worstSenateEver
You need to be taken by our enemies #Traitor #MAGA
Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform, Fund The Wall, Infrastructure...NOW!
You have a once in a lifetime opportunity to help MAGA & you're pissing it away. Why? U could have 8 yrs of history on Yur side! Pls go away
Drain the swamp
It never dawned on them that it would become possible 4 Americas leadrship 2 give our country away thru immigratn polcies. #No2DACAAndIslam
You are nuts. #DACA been your friendly neighbors and businesses for years. You probably hadn't heard of #DACA until 2017
@POTUS @GOP #MAGA just so the GOP and all you Trump fans out there forget "I like people who weren't captured" - Trump....think about that
Nice one!
And we are all reminded of your failure to help us.  We are prisoners of your failed leadership.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't like those that were captured!#TrumpMisfits  #TrumpUnfitToLeadUS
Thank you brave soldiers & your families for your service and sacrifice.
Its only good to remember
Trump hates POWs
#endfilibuster  Get It DONE
Bot

"I like people who WEREN'T captured." - the leader of your party, @realDonaldTrump
Think u better proof this Mccturtle.
Remember also the misery we caused civilians all around the world bc of warmongers like you.
Is @realDonaldTrump with you on that? I know he prefers soldiers who weren't captured.
Let us REMIND U of the hardship the American People R under -let's get 2 work & at least pretend you are a Conservative.  @realDonaldTrump
41 Republican Senators Voted Against a Landmark Veterans Bill in February, Today They Blame the VA
This must be your favourite symbol.
Come clean. Do you also keep KKK banners in your basement?
Like you and your party, a known force multiplier for Vladimir Putin?
SEN.CASSIDY GOT $21 MILLION BUCKS, FOR WHAT???

.@realDonaldTrump says he likes people who weren't captured. #VetsAgainstTrump
More military pandering is pandering to the base seems like there's all military holiday almost every day
