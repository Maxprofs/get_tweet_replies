@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Our voice re-elected @BarackObama Merrick Garland is who we want
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis the people chose POTUS. POTUS nominates SCOTUS judges. You're supposed to vote them. So vote on #MerrickGarland.

@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The people gave their voice when they elected the President to 4 year term, not a 3 & 1/4 year term. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @vine hence the fact you are a elected official. Set term limits that's a darn good start
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #DoYourJob

@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis how about giving the people a voice and back Trump?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @vine This is almost unspeakable in allowing a SCOTUS seat to remain vacant for almost a year due to politics.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Why not amend the Constitution to 3yrs for POTUS if not going to be allowed to perform duties in 4 year of term?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @vine Like the over 60 million voices that voted @BarackObama the POTUS IN 08 & 12?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Wasn't their voice heard when they elected the current president?
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis DO YOUR JOB. Seriously, #DoYourJob

@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 

#DoYourJob 

#DoYourMotherfuckingJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis hold a hearings & vote on the SCOTUS nominee is my advice.
So a mediocre Ron Perlman clone thinks a black Prez' term only lasts 7 years? @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis The People shared their voice in TWO CONSECUTIVE elections - @POTUS got majority twice! New excuse, please.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis stop ignoring the constitution and DO. YOUR. JOB.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Name your party's judicial nominee then.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @vine I ALREADY VOTED. Listen to the American people and #DoYourJob
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis except the people have a voice. They elected President Obama for 8 years, not 7. Do your job.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Thom, millions of Americans go to work every day. Some do jobs they don't want to do. But they do it. Do yours!
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I tell my kids that being a grown up means taking responsibility. You make $175,000 now #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis we already have a voice in the process.  Every person involved was elected, including President Obama #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis He people spoke with their voice when Barack Obama was elected president. #constitution
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Do your job. We had our voice when we elected @BarackObama
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I DID choose! I voted for Obama precisely because I wanted him to pick SCOTUS justices. He is still President.
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 

No ones buying this. This transparent strategy has failed. The American public disagrees in poll after poll.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis He too is an embarrassment.
.@Senate_GOPs .@SenThomTillis We already did when Pres. Obama was elected, his term isn't over. #DoYourJob or resign
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis This isn't a conservative stance.  Votes in 08, 10, 12, and 14 still matter.  #DoYourJob #AllVotesMatter
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Let me ... I believe the American People had a voice, President Obama was elected for 2nd 4 year term.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @vine: Totally agree! USA voted TWICE for @POTUS to do his job. Now give #MerrickGarland a hearing. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @GOP Do your job. We had a voice and elected President Obama He's done his job now do yours.

@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Take this from the party being led by a racist fascist? Don't think so #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I see why you're confused by a full POTUS term #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Calling bullshit on this... We have already voted. The time to act is NOW.  Do your job.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I agree NO hearing on any recommendation for #SCOTUS by Obama. He is RADICAL in so many ways. Gloria Poole,RN
@gloriapoole you're seriously going to tell us that garland is a "radical" nominee?
@sporter Anybody nominated by a RADICAL prodeather is RADICAL. Obama thinks like an evil man b/c he is an evil man.
@gloriapoole pro-deather. what does this even mean
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis we voted for Obama. Twice. Sorry he's an affront to you because he's 'Presidenting While Black' #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Fail. Doubling down on dysfunction. Stalemate is not leadership, it's just the inertia of black hole GOP Est.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis you are speaking for your party and not the American people. This is a joke, and why the GOP is sadly about dead
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis you pompous donor beholden elites saying you want to give the citizens a voice in anything is laughable.
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis clown statement. President is elected for 4 years. Do you job and get over it
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis @vine I think first you should listen to our voice on WE THE PEOPLES PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE! Thanks
@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis I thought we were giving our voice when we voted in 2012, for a 4 year presidential term...
