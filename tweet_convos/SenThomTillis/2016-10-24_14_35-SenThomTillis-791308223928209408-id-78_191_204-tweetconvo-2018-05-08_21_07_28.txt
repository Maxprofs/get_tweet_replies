as soon as the insurance lobby stops paying the corrupt Republicans, Obamacare will succeed
The pot calling the kettle black. You people had the power to defund and let it sail right through. GOP lost their way. No balls.
Rather than work with @POTUS to improve ACA, @SenateGOP & @SenThomTillis sabotaged it, hurting Americans.
Money Laundering Clinton & Obama HealthCare FAILED - WE the Taxpayers pay for it.. Vote #TRUMP Healthcare Reform
@artistdime @SenThomTillis 
Well maybe if u want 2 fix it, ur party should support ur Presidential candidate.
When I'm in the U.S. Senate, from IL, I'll help repeal Obamacare.  It disobeys the 10th Amendment.
file a suit to reverse the law that is killing middle income people who have to buy their own insurance
So, are we surprised?  And this from a president who promised full transparency......
Obamacare saved my ass. Even though I'm subjected to back-door socialism with the deceased compression ratio.
ink
if you know how to fix it fix it. You know you can't fix it. You people just belly ach. Do your freeking job
now instead of the GOP trying to get rid of the ACA perhaps u should improve it.
the thing is, it works... it works for those that didn't have insurance coverage.
We need to #SavetheSenate
Just like you all are doing with Trump! I'll wait for a response
you're right, Obamacare is awful. But stop trying to replace it. Stick to small gov, free markets, and STAY OUT OF MY HEALTHCARE!
Tillis u need 2 retract ur words i have placed an address showing u came out aganist it "video" showing it shame
all of y'all knew from the start how about you and colleagues share some of the blame for it not working
Guess Justice Roberts should rethink his dumb vote when he had the chance to get rid of Obamacare. Now we suffer!
I assume that if HRC wins, GOP senate will stop HRC's attempt to "fix" it. Trump can bring home a healthcare fix
open and transparent remember!!!! ha ha ha
sound like what our fore father's fought the revolution over taxation without representation

85% of Obamacare enrollees receive federal subsidies. Basically, all Americans will be paying more.
Donald Trump needs take advice from DWTS.They dont whine and cry like babies when they get eliminated
Hey Senate GOP, where's that inquiry into Hillary paying off the FBI lead investigator's wife?
has anything our dictator in chief done reflected reality? He has no clue how to make US work..then, now or ever
One of my biggest expenses is healthcare and it was that way before Obamacare.   GOP refuses to regulate.
Why not help fix it rather than whine about it? Also, do your job & interview president's pick for justice.
Tillis you are a crook
hey shhh, shhh, not right to talk, haphap, #DemsTakesHouseandSenateBack2016 
#VotingYouOut, #NoWorkNoSeat,#UrFired
Rather than admit #ACA is working, @SenateGOP @SenThomTillis obstruct all efforts to improve it, preferring party over Americans.#DoYourJob
But you stinking RINO's funded it and stuck us with the bill. @SpeakerRyan 
#LockUpTheRinos
come out for our  serviceman don't let Obama take back their bonus SPEAK OUT NOW
why are you guys now talking.  you guy are UNBELIVEABLE with Iraq. $5. For seinors raise. Hello where are you. Speak about seinor
Why oh why can't Obama do nothing like republicans & let millions go without healthcare? Why?
like to see you accomplish as much as Prez Obama. Despite racist obstructionism Obama  kicked your Republican ass.
@karenmcallier @SenThomTillis yeah, just like Hilly's gonna win. 30 people at her rally , 25,000 at @realDonaldTrump -
your plan beside OBSTRUCTING Obama? Shameful pack of good for nothing power hungry politicians you deserve Trump.
It was that "RUSSIAN AIR CONDITIONER"
It's the GOP's fault for not challenging "budget reconciliation" to start with. #useless!
So do you have taxpayer funded healthcare Senator?
Why put it that way? Why not just tell the truth. Why not say THE PRESIDENT LIED.
Stop Obamacare!! It worthless and insurance spikes are out of control.


All #GOP does is blame Obama & dems. In case you haven't noticed NO ONE wants to hear it anymore.  WORK TOGETHER!!
This is EXACTLY why #GOP is dying. #Obamacare at least TRIED to put brakes on glutenous HC industry. FIX IT THEN!!
That is because the man is a liar and you guys won't bust him out on it... someone ought to tear into him on it.
Fix the parts that don't work your jobs 16 years with no help is not a 2 party system
vote Trump!
@POTUS posed the most obvious solution.
FIX @Obamacare!  Why are you #Republicans so clueless????
ding gong gop is dead
Impeach him for covering up illegal activity!

Elected officials are traitorous morons for letting that little punk disregard the health of Americans.
Practice makes perfect.
the Affordable Health Care Plan will hit everyone in the face.  Where will Pres Obama be when it hits the fan?
To bad the GOPe is fighting against @realDonaldTrump to put these reforms into motion. The dems are more unified.
wharcha going to do?
do nothing Congress.  No support for the nominee.  Time to go independent
its just like a starter home bugs and all!money pit.but gosh golly isn't it grand I didnt even read the fine print
At least he tried something. Insurance is out of control and #GOP continues to bash. DO YOUR JOB!!! Fix #Obamacare
oh Republicans y'all are going to lose the #Senate this year
