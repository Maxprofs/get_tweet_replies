so then vote #noDevos and BE the BETTER politician
YES YES YES! Vote #NoDevos and show you have integrity and you are not part of the SWAMP.
ugh...this doesn't bode well for democracy
I'll bet Burr is kicking himself, he should have held out for more than $43 K like Tillis.
@SenatorBurr Evidently ..... Tillis cost more.
They voted for HRC, by a majority.
and you failed miserably to produce those results. AMERICA did NOT want Devos but you proved it's all about the $ for you.
3Million more people voted for a moderate government, not a neo-Nazi government, run by a sociopath. GOP ok with treason.
CONFIRM GORSUCH
What made them tired of it was what was seen in O's administration.  The R's are total hypocrites on this issue.
Americans voted #GOP and #TRUMP to halt immigration..#BANMUSLIMS #BANILLEGALS  #BUILDTHATWALL #2A #JOBS #JOBS #BANABORTION
.@SenThomTillis Great news. When will u meet with constituents to hear our views & discuss your plans to work? #bipartisan #RiseTogetherNC
You did get this right, there's no mandate.  Can't wait to discuss during your town hall!  Oh, youre #cowardly not having one
an autocracy is not better than gridlock. You're being a damned ass
.@SenThomTillis many voted to REPEAL ObamaCare.  Little was said about replacing it.  Recall nothing was there prior to OCARE.
Easier said than done.  You'll  to give up your love affair with Donald and Fox News to make it happen.  Have a town hall.
Commonsense is not to appoint a KKK GOVT. The American People need fairness, equality, and civil peace and growth.
You're right we did NOT vote for a GOP mandate. We voted for a Dem. @SenThomTillis
We were hoping for someone who stood up for NC. You've both lost my vote, sir. #bipartisan #notboughtandpaidfor
if you believed this you would've stood up to Trump and voted no on DeVos. The people of NC are supremely disappointed in you
It's time for a town meeting, Sir.
always so much easier for the party in power to play the "bipartisan" card.  Grateful for @LisaForSenate and @SenatorCollins
Your job is to vote in the best interest of your constituents. We want you to vote NO to DeVos!!
you ran your campaign on a commitment to public education. DeVos has failed MI & will fail America #voteNO
You could have broken a 50-50 gridlock with a sensible vote on the #DeVosvote nomination. Business as usual in the swamp.
The Republicans are the main source of the gridlock!  And I say that as a Republican!
. Shame then, that you voted party line for a wholly unqualified Secretary of Education.
Very disappointed in your vote...
.@SenThomTillis since Obamacare replaced NOTHING, why not replace Obamacare with NOTHING, which is what we had previously.  @TeaPartyJane
Country over Party. Country over Party Country over Party Country over Party. Ooops, you failed
get the word out, NC is in her pocket
love this sentiment! Now let's walk the walk baby!
So you are ok with this present administration totally dismantling our country? Bannon? You are all in cohoots? Sad.
And then you ignored our voices and went for the $$$. @SenThomTillis
Schedule #townhall meetings across NC with your #constituents!  Plan on a big crowd; folks have many questions and concerns.
bullshit you were voted in to DEFEAT LIBERALISM. MAN UP NOW
Vote for kids in rural NC. Vote NO on DeVos.
Coming from a member of the party that made doing nothing for 8 years its platform,in an effort to thwart Obama,this is rich.
Very true. Yet you just partisanly supported an unqualified candidate for Dept of Education, one who paid you.
let's see those constituent comment tallies your office received on #DeVos. We want to know who you really represent.
SHAME ON YOU. YOUR POLITICAL PARTY CAME BEFORE THE FUTURE LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY. SHAME SHAME SHAME.
please vote NO on  DeVos -- she is not qualified
They also voted for a Senator who will listen. Why with all of the calls are you still not committed to #VoteNoDevos? Sad.
Please vote for NC Public Schools today and vote #NoDevos. Thank you!
YES WE DID. And so far Trumps cabinet picks do not represent me. PLEASE vote NO 
Our kids deserve the best NOT #BetsyDeVos
Exactly, thank you! Looking forward to seeing you vote NO for Betsy Devos! #noDevos
Vote NO to Betsy Devos! Show you have the courage to vote for your country, not your party. Please do the right thing!
wow after 6 years of your party causing gridlock now you want everyone to work together. Find this funny.
vote no on DeVos.  Show everyone you truly mean what you say.  She knows nothing about this job! #noDevos
YES! Good work, Senator! Thank you!
calling Charlotte and D.C. Offices to no avail goes right to voicemail. Are you ignoring your constituents? #NotoDeVos meetus
Exactly!  Now please show some bipartisanship and some care for your constituents by voting 'NO' to DeVos today.
Yet the gridlock remains as Republicans put toeing the party line above good for people. #VoteNoDevos
Americans are also tired of politicians who vote with dollars instead of sense. #DumpDevos
As a concerned NC mother, I urge you to show your bipartisanship and vote NO on Devos.
Any men, women, or dogs that received "monetary contributions" should have their vote stricken. No way to be impartial.
If NC cuts you a $701,000 check will you work for its best interests instead?
You don't listen to your constituents. Believe us, we're counting down the days until you get voted out.
Is that how you're spinning it now?
your constituents know the price of your soul;it is cheap &worthless! #devos bought your vote!You sir, are an #EMBARRASSMENT!
they're tired of party politics.Don't vote for Betsy http://DeVos.You  know she is not qualified&has no business being in the cabinet
& @SenatorBurr ~ #BetsyDeVos #BetsyDeVos #BetsyDeVos *Real change & #choices NOT same old #Communist #manifesto #education
These are not the results that ANY American wants.  Get with the program, your constituents are watching!
Vote NO for Devos. She's WRING for education!
Exactly. So why be part of the problem? Let's find a candidate who is qualified for the job. #RepublicansAgainstDevos
US spends a fortune on education & rank keeps dropping. Old way isn't working, kids are being dumbed down. Vote accordingly.
I hope u will oppose @BetsyDeVos. #StopDeVos has widespread bipartisan support. We're watching. Our kids deserve better. 
Vote NO to DeVos and prove you mean what you say
#NoDeVos
This Libertarian voted for De Donald
Show the world that you truly believe this and vote to stop DeVos!
Amen. Show this country u have STANDARDS for these cabinet positions. Vote NO on DeVos and Sessions. We need real candidates!
@ThomTillis you are right. Represent your constituents! #DumpDevos !!
a no vote on DeVos would show that this is more than just cheap talk. #NoOnDevos
@Mike_Beacham I am for term limits for Congress, stop insider trading, influence of lobbyists
Didn't POTUS put a hold on the lobby thingy?
Only people working with him. Not lobbyists influence on congressman.
please vote #NOtoDevos.  DeVos has NO Experience. And really? tv ad campaigns for cabinet nominees?
That is true. To the point, they SURE didn't vote for a Breitbart mandate!! #StopPresidentBannon
Vote no on DeVos and put those important words into action!
Absolutely. Please do all you can to make those results the best possible. For all our futures by voting  #noDevos Thank you.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/wanted-one-republican-with-integrity-to-defeat-betsy-devos.html â€¦ We need a Secretary of Education that values neighborhood schools.
Yes we did.  Please vote no on DeVos, not results oriented for Public Education, the cornerstone of our democracy.  NO DeVos
that is true so why are you afflicting DeVos on our education system if not bipartisanship?
Yes we are and we need Senators like you to back the people and not just vote on party lines.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Tillis I'm a Tarheels, don't agree w/ u all the time but this time I do
this gives me hope . Remember bipartisanship when it's time to vote. Is Devos really the best choice for our children ?Thanks
Yes we are. And tired of politicians who vote straight party lines instead of the voices of their constituents.
If you really do walk the talk, then please vote NO on DeVos. We need an educated populous, and our children deserve it! VTNO
Then #noDeVos is the smart path. No one voted for BAD results.
, as one of your constituents, PLEASE vote #NoDevos
Darn right. Vote your conscience, not the party line. Say no to DeVos.
Yes, now vote NO for DeVos and Sessions. Democrats and moderate Republicans will back you. #devos #sessionsconfirmation
Please vote NO on DeVos. Help our children.
Don't confuse action for voting for unqualified, ethically compromised candidates. Do the courageous thing. Vote NO on DeVos.
and BOTH parties' voters are asking you to vote #noDevos
I guess money talks. If you can't see that Devos is unqualified for the job, you're pathetic. Keep taking $$. We'll remember
Please vote no on Devos.  We need someone who can improve public schools, not get deplete or get rid of them.
Right we did not vote for grid lock. I hope that you consider no vote for Mrs. Devos. Children and their parents deserve this
YOU are the problem. YOU caused gridlock w/partisan gerrymandering. YOU ignore NC voters. #NCGOP #ncga #sessions #devos

Please block DeVos!! She will horribly affect families today and generations to come. And those kids are America's future!!
be bi-partisan and vote the will of the people #noDevos
If this is TRUE... #VoteNoDevos!
NO on DeVos! Prove you can't be bought!
Please Vote NO on DeVos! Totally unqualified! She's ruined schools in Michigan. This isn't a partisan issue. Kids come first!
it is your obligation to take care of kids in your state who rely on public education. NO on @BetsyDeVos !!
. @SenThomTillis what we are really tired of is immoral senators selling out our children for campaign $s.
@rugratfarm @SenThomTillis Instead what we got, white supremacist that did not drain the swamp they filled it with gators.
thank you!! Our children deserves better than DeVoss. Seriously.
Think you'll get results from #DeVos?
You'd get better outcomes from #WokeBaby
Get Trump's cabinet approved. Thanks from NC!
Vote NO ON THAT IMBECILE DEVOS SHE IS A COMPLETE FRAUD
Great hashtag! Show that #bipartisan spirit & vote NO on deVos.
Please think of our young people.Do not vote Devos.Children first
Republicans caused that gridlock.
I'll look forward to your bipartisan effort to vote no on Devos as many conservative and liberal NC educators are against her
Be politically courageous .vote #No #BetsyDeVos !
Devos will have the federal gov in court for years..
Please, vote No on DeVos, Senator!  Your constituents have been clear. The US citizens are clear.  Do what's right!
Gridlock? Results? You can break the gridlock by impeaching trump. That would be a great RESULT!
Results would be equal rights for all. How you doing on that? #manup #growaset #resisttrump
I'm not tired of the gridlock. I'm tired of politicians who have sold themselves to special interests.
Im a special education teacher and it's disturbing the education secretary nominee isn't familiar with the IDEA Act
vote no on DeVos
please vote no DeVos
They're tired of this shit.
VOTE NO ON #DEVOS She is not qualified to be representing education in this country
and now, based on that "mandate" of less than a majority, vote NO on Betsy Devos!
exactly, so please tell me what you will do to stop the #lies coming from the #WhiteHouse ? They hurt all parties/people.
Dementia?
You are on a sinking ship, better jump off now!  Trump is going down.
Start showing you are an American before Republican and save our Public Schools! #VoteNoDevos
they also did not vote for a president who demeans federal judges and the judiciary
Bipartisan?! If the children of NC were really your concern you would vote No to DeVos. #AutismMom #Advocate
Agreed!  Now prove you mean what you say by voting against DeVos.  Country first!
I will take gridlock when it protects us from fraud billionarie elites.  Please vote no on DeVos. Suggest someone better.
weren't republicans responsible for most of the gridlock and shutting down the government when they didn't get their way?
vote no on DeVos
I am glad you said NC voted for results. In 2 yrs the Senate may look very different if constituents voices aren't heard.
How can tweet this statement when u are so much a part of the gridlock?  If not, tweet me 1 bipartisan thing you voted for.
We did vote for a mandate.  Now we have to weed the majority party out.
You mean the gridlock caused by you and your fellow GOP senators? Yes, we want results in NC. NO on DeVos.
please vote no on Devos
VOTE NO ON DEVOS
you should really listen to the voters and grow a pair, vote NO DeVos! #VoteNoDevos
this makes a lot of sense. Pls do something bipartisan. Vote no on Devos.
We agree on the first half of your statement.  3 million more voted for @HillaryClinton. And they demand representation.
who was responsible for gridlock last 8 years?
@SenateRPC if that was true you'd have worked with Democratic senators instead of blocking everything #fucktheGOP #fucktrump
you are spineless. This is your public rhetoric while simultaneously ignoring the overwhelming consensus to vote no on Devos
you are putting donors over voters. You are partisan straight down the line. You are talking a talk & not even trying to walk
it's offensive you would even bother with this kind of dog & pony show of words while telling the hundreds (thousands?)...
of callers you are likely voting to approve the wildly unqualified #devos
we are your constituents. We are the parents of children in public schools.
if you want me to believe you are a man of action then you are going to have to ACT #VoteNoDevos
surely though, facism can't be the only answer, sir.
PLZ stand with the people & #StopDeVos she is Unqualified & bought this nomination. Show us ur not 4 sale #CountryOverParty
Did this many ppl complain when BO removed school choice in DC, re:Sidwell?
#noDevos I have emailed, called and now am asking you again. NO to DeVos.
so join with the Democrats and against Putin and Trump
no DeVos and no more lies from this Administration 
Seriously the world is watching the lies#manup
he is a bitch to lobbyist $$&
We're tired Of cronyism, lack of representation and the party above all mentality.
if you truly believe this you would listen to your constituents and vote no on @BetsyDeVos
then LISTEN to the people of your state and vote #noDevos
Please DO NOT vote for Devos.. we can do better!
#VoteNoDevos
@NCGOP we voted to repeal Obamacare! Not alter it, but repeal it! What's your conservative review score Thom? Hint: F
Then I'm sure you'll agree that it's imperative to work across party lines to block the confirmation of DeVos for Dept of Ed.
@NCGOP good job. Do t worry about these radical alt left lunatics
We also didn't vote for ppl that wouldn't repr sent us and only themselves #DumpDevos
hey citizens of North Carolina, Tillis campaign received $70,200 from DeVos. How much would it cost for a "no" vote? #NoDeVos
Yes, @POTUS has no mandate. Now Dodd-Frank is in the cross-hairs! W/o financial stability, we are sunk. Senate save us! (NC)
Please keep us informed of your specific bipartisan and unifying contributions and activities
What?! I want a CONSERVATIVE mandate!
caused by you! You just blame it on Dems.
Well said Senator. Please follow this line of thinking and vote #noDevos
it's ok to take bribes, as long as it doesn't affect your decision #noDevos
ok Senator lead the way. #bipartisan
Listen to your constituents and vote 'No' to DeVoes on Monday. This is our results mandate. Get out of the Trump swamp.
@SenateRPC The popular voters are sick of you and the Trump team looking to dismantle all the good work that Obama did! SHAME
then please show us you are willing to cross party lines and #VoteNoDevos. Parents and teachers in NC are watching.
Please vote "no" on DeVos. She is not qualified and her results would damage millions of children and college students.
Any Senator receiving money from DeVos family should recuse him- or herself from the final vote.
yes, vote no on DeVos! She is not what is best for North Carolina's children.
@SenateRPC keep in mind when elections roll around again you be gone
Yes, you are correct. But the results they want do not include killing off public education! You should vote #noDevos !
prove that you mean it by voting 
NO for DeVos
now that's funny. You are part of McConnell's shameful obstructionist caucus, right? #yourconstituent
please be principled, our children are counting on you!
