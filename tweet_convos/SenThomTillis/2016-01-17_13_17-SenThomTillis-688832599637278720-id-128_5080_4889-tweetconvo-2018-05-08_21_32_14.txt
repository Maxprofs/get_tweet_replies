@Elder_Punk hey now, that's a great song @Panthers
@Elder_Punk well, I'm a Red Sox fan, lived 13 years in the Boston area, so... ;) @Panthers
@Elder_Punk cool, small world :D
@Panthers keep pounding!
@Panthers Keep pounding entire game...conservative play calling 2nd half...24 unanswered points ???!?
@Panthers @WWERobinson Panthers are the hope to take out Arizona and destroy #Shady Brady!
.@Panthers Hey #Panthers you sure do have work to do, such as maybe score points in the second half ;) but for real just #KeepPounding. #NFL
@Panthers @NCDemParty 
@Panthers Congrats guys #keeppounding.
@Panthers
You can outrun the linebackers but can't outrun your past @CameronNewton 
@Hamm0nds @Panthers @CameronNewton wow you think your funny. Maybe you just jealous your team isnt as good as the panthers.
@MastinMitchell @Panthers @CameronNewton yee yee redneck takeover
@Hamm0nds @Panthers @CameronNewton yeah looks like your team didn't make it
@MastinMitchell @Panthers @CameronNewton in all seriousness they didn't
@Panthers @YoungRemedy415
@Panthers So proud of you guys!
@Panthers McClain, you have 1 week to become a probowler, everyone saw you, Palmer the first on the list.
@Panthers idk why we keep having so much trouble in the 3rd quarter. Talk about a nailbiter! #KeepPounding #SEAvsCAR
@Panthers The 1st half DAB turned to 2nd half BAD. Come on Panthers! You can do this1
@Panthers check out my hit single for da lady's first Tyme f @teenybarrino
@Panthers @wis10 Got to learn to step on a throat Giants and Seahawks come to mind.  Championship teams put them away up 28 or 31.
@Panthers That's what happens when both teams really wanna go to the #SuperBowl2016!! #KeepPounding
@Panthers good game guys from a Seahawks fan :(. Rooting for you to the Super Bowl now. Cam deserves it
@Panthers well done...on the road to super bowl, 
.@Panthers It's time for a #Dab emoji... #KeepPounding #Panthers

@Panthers @zachhenson2013 that's fun pal
@Panthers # Keep Pounding #Way to Go Panthers # Awesome Win
@Panthers Remember that the game is 60 minutes long, not 30, m'kay?
@Panthers unstoppable! Great game!! You're the Best!!! #Keep Pounding
@Panthers  Go job
@Panthers What was it that the #Panthers DC was doing in the 2nd half. Please don't try that again.
@Panthers Yes, you do.  Even though it turned out in our favor, you cannot fail to score in the whole second half.
@Panthers Great Win! #KeepPounding
@Panthers  Good thing I don't like long fingernails, because that 2nd half made me bite them all off! No repeat of that against AZ please!
@Panthers My son @Uno_Ryan was a Panther for 3 years, K-2 grade. Now a Sr. & STILL wearing his jersey EACH game!!!
@Panthers Yes, you do with Coleman and Finnegan.
@Panthers We got lucky and made it easier on sea cause we backed off.  Have to learn to keep our foot on the gas for 4 qtrs.
@Panthers @tonystewartntn good job!!!
@Panthers
@Panthers  First Half Points was more than enough to WIN & DID!   
#KeepPounding #PantherNation
@Panthers @SamSchweitzer9 Arizona gonna beat that ass bitchessss
@Panthers  Congrats to my favorite NFL team I am so stoked
Good luck against the Cardinals @Panthers
@Panthers ya got it done but let's keep the offense on the gas and leave the zone and prevent defense on John Madden...congrats
@Panthers Panther fan no matter what but you guys can't do that against Arizona. Time to stop putting it in neutral after a big lead.
@Panthers Wow I'm glad that didn't turn into a loss after that 2nd half! That was just stressful. Congrats guys!! #KeepPounding
