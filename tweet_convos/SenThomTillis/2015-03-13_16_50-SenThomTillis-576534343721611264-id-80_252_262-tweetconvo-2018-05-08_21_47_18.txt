@SenTomCotton it seems your letter has roused the interests of the visceral, not-quite-American crowd. True Americans appreciate your stand.
@SenTomCotton I praise the Service Members as well. But you, Tom, are still a twit. http://tomcottonisatwit.com  #TEHRANCOTTON #TOMCOTTONISATWIT
@SenTomCotton I think we should Prosecute the '47 who undermined POTUS & place those charged at GITMO, or Sen. Cotton could enlist 4 BOTG?
