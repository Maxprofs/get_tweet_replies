whats this new obsession with the RGV? If we all come down & wear "I Brownsville" shirts, will u do townhall?
Please sign a petition asking for @SenThomTillis townhalls.  Pls retweet! #TheResistance
I live in NC, I don't care a wit what you astro-turfers want. Take your Soros money elsewhere!
beautiful thing about our country is you have the right to be a small minded, name calling asshole. Enjoy this beautiful day!
Name Calling? Amazing, your education was wasted.
too bad @SenThomTillis can't say the same. #corrupt #swampcabinet
Sen. Tillis:  nice horseback outing on your vacation.  When is your next town hall meeting?  Lots to talk about!
Which border is @SenThomTillis patrolling?  South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, or Virginia?
Ride than on up to NC so that we can have a town hall.
.@JohnCornyn @SenThomTillis We'd be better off if he fell off, broke a hip, threw a clot then perished. He's about as good dead as alive.
A TONYA HARDING WHACK JOB WOULD BE GOOD FOR NOW
quit with the crap quality photos and hold a town hall!! #wewillnotbesilent
so you can attack him?
No, because they aren't GQ models. Stop with the photos and meet your constituents!
oh not a hypocrite just an angry vile person.
"angry vile person." What on earth are you talking about?
tired of ANTI NC ACTIVIST demanding a townhall to harrass OUR reps? Call 1 of their preferred reps & tell them
Not so clever way to avoid your constituents.
Wrong state, Thom! You represent North Carolina. Come visit with us!
Please ask NC farmers about ALL those Americans begging for the hard jobs harvesting the food the we eat.
- The Grand Homegoing. The saddle soars are worth it. Good job!
more qualified for that than the Senate
sooner OUR senator Tillis tells the Anti NC activist callin for a townhall to harrass our reps to GFTS the better
tell @SenThomTillis to come home, we'd like to talk to him.
Nice vest! Is this a photo op or are you Senators going to do something to protect your fellow Americans?
What a joke, Senator from NC. Come home and do a town hall! That is what this week on your calendar is for.
You had time to play with horses at the border, but no time to meet with your constituents? #sad #TownHall
he can fake protect the border but not meet with voters in real life!!! What a joke & hypocrite. #trump #Oscars
so this is where that asshole went.
Ok cowboy. When you're done riding horsies, NC voters want a Town Hall. 
I'm having a mtg tonight. 
How bout it?
Is this boy scout camp?
We need o enforce the laws and secure our borders. Do what is right, and necessary! thank you.
He is Running for The Border!!!!
where in North Carolina is that? #carytownhall
lol... costume party
I challenge you to sit down with immigrants and hear their side.  It might surprise you.  #comprehensivereform
I mean really really straight riding his 15 minutes of fame #carytownhall
.@JohnCornyn  Meanwhile, children in NC are being targeted by #Antisemitism  bomb threats. NC sees your priorities, @SenThomTillis
why the hell isnt he in North Carolina listening to his constituents???
#lastterm
#resist
thanks for checking how TERRIBLE the borders are. No need for town halls. Just get @realDonaldTrump stuff done!
Coward! U can hide from constituents 2day, but not 4ever.
You need to get off your high horse and hold a town hall! We are waiting for you in Hendersonville and Asheville!
I'm not liking this. I think u should rethink your political position.  Moderation is not expressed on horseback.
playing instead of doing your job! Town hall!! Meet with us!! Coward!
Your democrat town hall party is Sheila J Lee. Are you reading your instructions from Soros.
nice photo. When is your town hall, again, Thom?
been agitating long?
how old are you cupcake 12?
Thinking about Putin on the horse or Dukakis on the tank, but its too easy. Also, #townhall Also, 
when your senator would rather ride a horse than listen to constituents
You look mighty impressive. You'd look more so at a town hall meeting in your state! We sure do miss you.
agitator alert
.@JohnCornyn @SenThomTillis Stop riding horsies and COME TALK TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS! #TownHall
Badass!
when is the townhall? Otherwise this could be your first and last term. Let the people be heard...thank you.
. @JohnCornyn @SenThomTillis he SHOULD be in NC talking to his constituents.
Maybe that horse can trot the Senator over to NC for a town hall meeting?
looks like fun, when is our town hall?
Playing cowboy instead of meeting w/ constituents.
Hay, Senator! How's about a meetup in NC with the actual people you represent? You choose the barn, let us know.
You realize Eastern NC is an actual border, right? We need to talk to you about that.
Will do anything to avoid facing the people he is supposed to represent! How about an in person town hall?
you work for us senator, or have you forgotten. Hold a town hall please.
Your blue book from Soros is not working.
do you really think, in your heat of hearts I am being paid to disagree with my reps? Because I'm not.
The Soros play book is not working anymore.
C'mon @SenThomTillis, at least Putin took his shirt off.
Quit with the drivel please. We don't care. What do we care about? A town hall.
way to look tough with the body armor in one of the safest places on earth. #DoYourJob
John Cornyn hold a Town Hall
Go do your town hall with your democrat party. I'm sure Shiela Lee would love to do it.
Sheila Lee is not my Rep asshat.  Cruz, Cornyn and Culberson are.  All no shows, dipshits
Soros playbook is not working anymore.
so you can attack them!  So transparent
when is the townhall - Dm me 
been an agitator long?
constituent 
I'm glad you're spending time on a tour of our boarder, but when is the town hall?
AGITATOR ALERT
guess you don't care about our military families like you say you do. Shame on you
#fakesenators
you have time to post this but no time for your constituents? Enjoy your seat now b/c you will be dethroned #turningtxblue
he's not up for reelection until 2020....he'll glide back into the senate for another term on trumps coattails.
gross
