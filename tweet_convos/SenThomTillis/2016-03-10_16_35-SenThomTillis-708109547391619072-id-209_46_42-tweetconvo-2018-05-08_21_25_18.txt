@ChuckGrassley @GoochZilla - Respect is earned; Repubs have acted like children for 7 yrs now. Why should you be invited? -
@sidecarhammond The #GOPEstablishment is indiscernible from the #DemCratParty, which is why #Cruz and #Trump are winning. #TCOT
@GoochZilla - HA!! ..... more like Drumpf then Cruz, neither of which are getting anywhere near the White House. -
@sidecarhammond Well, if the American voter chooses #Hillary over #Trump or #Cruz, it's not the fault of people who love the Country. #TCOT
@GoochZilla - only 'conservatives' r the 'people who love this country'? The arrogance! I love this country more than you fucks ever will. -
@sidecarhammond YOU love the #WelfareState, NOT the Country. "Asshole." LOL
@GoochZilla - Try to put together an independent thought; the capability is within you. #TCOT -
@sidecarhammond Stick your script SIDEWAYS in your AHHSSS, you flaring Myrmidon. And emigrate. :) #TCOT
@ChuckGrassley spelling not your strong suit as well
@ChuckGrassley You're abridging my rights. The people have spoken, 2x. We want our Pres to be able to do his job. Try doing yours for once.
@ChuckGrassley you've had plenty of meetings, now... Hop to it, make a commitment to #DoYourJob!
@ChuckGrassley Mr. Senator I believe you made it clear that you wanted nothing to do with the process. I hope you #doyourjob fairly and soon
@ChuckGrassley Apparently your senility is catching up with you - you just had a meeting on this very subject with POTUS last week
@ChuckGrassley Maybe if you and leg. Committee would do your job, you'd be invited to play with the other senators. Sorry Charlie.
@xebec78 @ChuckGrassley that's a fair point, but the republicans on the legislative committee are still ignoring their duties.
@xebec78 @ChuckGrassley but they refuse to even sit on nominee just based on partisan bs.
@xebec78 @ChuckGrassley maybe, but that's not the issue, it's a hypothetical.
@ChuckGrassley I wish that you would do your Constitutional duty.
@ChuckGrassley Stop the partisan politics! #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley and your point is?
@ChuckGrassley Senator, when your party no longer meets in secret 2 stonewall POTUS, U may whine all U like about secret meetings of Dems.
@ChuckGrassley By not giving Judge Garland a hearing/vote, you are undermining the spirit of the constitution #obstructionism #SCOTUSnominee
@ChuckGrassley Didn' tU meet with POTUS Mar 1st? Do your job.My tax$has been paying  U $174.000  4  154days per Yr
@ChuckGrassley like you invited Dems to your Obstruction meeting?
@ChuckGrassley do your job.
@ChuckGrassley Nothing as hideous as GOP secret meeting on Inauguration Night 2009, when y'all vowed to obstruct Obama & will of the people.
@ChuckGrassley The Republicans had already been quite clear on shirking their constitutional duties, why would they be invited?
@ChuckGrassley maybe if you didn't turn them down the first time and refuse to do your job, you would have been invited. #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley I wish you would do your job or resign.
@ChuckGrassley Y have U received $975.000. In farm subsidies Those are my tax dollars. You also get $174,000.yearly 4. max 154 days a yr
@ChuckGrassley Thank you for holding off the vote until after the election.
@ChuckGrassley http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/3/11/1499688/-Senate-Republicans-move-into-victimization-phase-of-Supreme-Court-fight …  Sick and tired of obstructionism. We elected Obama--twice. Deal with it and #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley you have absolutely no integrity and you're writing your entire legacy right now.
@ChuckGrassley Constitution says Senate Shall give advice and consent on nominees.  You are not doing your job! Thief!
@ChuckGrassley If you play fair, you get invited to parties, If you don't play fair, you get left out.
@ChuckGrassley Very out of character, sir. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm if u cn rd ths u cn gt a gd jb
@ChuckGrassley why should they invite you? You already told POTUS to fuck off last time you met with him about SCOTUS. #mcconnellsbitch
@ChuckGrassley wish you would do your job....instead of doing nothing.
@ChuckGrassley I wish you weren't such a liar. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Why you can't do your job no matter what.
@ChuckGrassley HA. LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. you forgot that you don't do your job anymore #SCOTUS
.@ChuckGrassley don't think u can complain since at ur own SC meeting w/ Pres, u & McConnell said u wouldn't even CONSIDER a vote on ANY nom
@ChuckGrassley Did you read this tweet to see how idiotic it sounds?  https://storify.com/DemFromCT/david-frum-on-the-repucan-party-s-dilemma …
@ChuckGrassley And this is after YOU had REFUSED 2 meet w/ the president. Time 4 u 2 know what unemployment feels like.
@ChuckGrassley Please do not cave-into the pressure, Sen. Grassley!  Stand strong!
@ChuckGrassley Please remind Obama that you fulfilled your constitutional responsibility by advising him you will not consent #scotus.
@ChuckGrassley dems wouldn't need secret meeting if wasn't unprecedented obstruction from judiciary committee.
@ChuckGrassley You were asked to go before they were! Why didn't you talk then? Iowa is ashamed of you. doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley resign already
@ChuckGrassley Did you forget about the Republican secret SCOTUS mtg that was held? You weren't  invited?
@ChuckGrassley Tick Tock, We have a President, Do your damn job.
@ChuckGrassley Your refusal to even hear nominees is disgraceful, unprecedented obstructionism. You should be ashamed. Do your job.
@ChuckGrassley you're whining bc you didn't get invited to a meeting the Dems had re: SCOTUS?  You can't be serious! #titsonaboarhog
@ChuckGrassley What exactly is today's going price for integrity?
@ChuckGrassley And when did .@POTUS hear about secret meeting 1/20/2009 when you treasonous shitbags decided to obstruct EVERYTHING? F you.
@ChuckGrassley You sure whine a lot for someone who refuses to do his basic Advise and Consent duty.  Quit bitching and do your job.
@ChuckGrassley -- Really? Cuz I wish you'd read the Constitution instead of playing "victim" & acting like a whiny 2-year-old. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob or it's gonna come back to bite you in the ass in November.
.@ChuckGrassley Wish Dems had bn invited 2 GOP secret mtg night of Obama inauguration, where GOP plotted 2 obstruct him
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Boo Hoo http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/11/1499688/-Senate-Republicans-move-into-victimization-phase-of-Supreme-Court-fight …
@ChuckGrassley maybe since you announced you'd obstruct they thought why bother. Can't have cake and eat it too! #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley No you don't! Eff you, Chuckles!
@ChuckGrassley Wish you'd get your head out of your ass and agree to have hearings/votes on SCOTUS nominees.
@ChuckGrassley Why? are you changing your mind, will you do your job of advise and consent to nominee?
@ChuckGrassley Do your Constitiutional job, even if the nomination is formally rejected.
.@ChuckGrassley Maybe McConnell should have invited dems to his secret meeting in 08 where u all decided to obstruct everything POTUS does.
@ChuckGrassley REPUBLICAN THIEVES STOLE AMERICAN HOMES NOW THEY WANT TO ABOLISH OUR U.S.A. GOVERNMENT LIKE A GD COMMUNISTS! KMA!
@ChuckGrassley YOUR FRONT RUNNER DONALD TRUMP REALLY MIRRORS THE WHOLE FACE OF THE U.S. REPUBLICAN PARTY! HOW COOL IS THAT?
@ChuckGrassley Why do you care? You refuse to consider anyone for the gig anyway. Not the greatest strategy by you guys.
@ChuckGrassley You said you wouldn't even meet with him about it?  Make up your mind!!!!
@ChuckGrassley KMA! YOU PEOPLE ACT LIKE SOUTHERN WHITE RACISTS ATTHE AMERICAN PEOPLES' EXPENSE! LET BANKERS STEAL AMERICAN HOMES! FUNDEDISIS
@ChuckGrassley Why?You People...Have already said You are Blocking President Obama's Nominee. That is Repub Mentally Constipated for America
@ChuckGrassley oh, like y'all invite them to your closed door meetings where you all pledge to do nothing?
@ChuckGrassley Do you invite the Dems to all of your closed-door meetings?
.@ChuckGrassley I wish my Senator would stop thinking partisan politicking is more important than a fully functioning government.
@ChuckGrassley which is it Senator? HATE, DISRESPECT, age or you don't know what you want. Either ur for or against Constitution
@ChuckGrassley if you did your job, maybe there would have been an invite. #DoYourJob #embarrassment2Iowans #termlimits
@ChuckGrassley You said you won't hold a SCOTUS hearing until 2017, so why invite you to a mtg about holding a hearing in 2016? Pity?
@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley Look at average # of supreme ct. appointments made 4  four yr & eight yr. President & max. avg. is TWO. Obama has had his TWO
@ChuckGrassley why you have already said nothing will be done by the Senate.
@ChuckGrassley Wish Republicans operated in good faith. But you refuse.
@ChuckGrassley  Oh, boohoo you. Are you serious?
@ChuckGrassley Everyone wants the truth but no one wants to be honest.
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm Why would they invite government freeloaders who don't want to work? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley why would you be invited when you've already said you'll block any nominee?  Can't have your cake and eat it too. #SCOTUS
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm Wish Repubs would do their jobs.
@ChuckGrassley @SenThomTillis batshit crazy is a good description of your party. After your behavior in the last few years, ur party is done
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm why do you think u would get invited? Its tradition to not invite LAME DUCK Senators in an election year. Sad!
@ChuckGrassley they didn't want you there
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm You refuse to hold a hearing and have the nerve to complain about not being invited to a meeting. Typical hoc rite
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm What does it matter? U & your cronies r so set against doing what's for the country, U made yourself irrelevant.
@ChuckGrassley wish u were inclined to do ur job
@ChuckGrassley  No to Obama Judge! Now you're lying about Dems to cover your butt Evil Gop refuses to do Job! Time for your Retirement Sen
@ChuckGrassley Time for you to resign, Senator.
@ChuckGrassley Why does it matter? Your maj leader has already said it won't matter - you'll arbitrarily reject any nominee. @joshtpm
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm thank you for the comic relief. Seriously you can not make this stuff up.
@ChuckGrassley Do Your Job sir. Country over party. Stop the games. Do your job.
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley if you #doyourjob you can then go outside and play
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm spoken like a real victim
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm after Obama refused ACA compromise, this is expected. He's an autocrat.
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm is chuck senile? Translate!
@ChuckGrassley Are you under the influence or is your keyboard missing letters?
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm Oh, maybe they took you at your word about refusing to consider ANY candidate for SCOTUS, within hours of vacancy.
@ChuckGrassley Once you see your declining poll numbers back in Iowa, this will all blow over, and hearings will be held pronto.
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm Hey grassley, #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm 
With all due respect you refuse to honor the wishes of the American people
Why should you be invited out for pizza?
@chuckgrassley @joshtpm What's the point? You'd refuse a vote on Christ himself if nominated.
@ChuckGrassley You don't want to play, but whine when they don't invite you over? Waaaaah!
@ChuckGrassley @joshtpm oh Jesus Christ.  Seriously??
@ChuckGrassley B.S. dude. Now you want to be involved after you pledged you wouldn't participate in SCOTUS discussion? Shameful politician.
@ChuckGrassley didn't you guys have a meeting with the pres a week a go, and nothing came of it?
@ChuckGrassley so any chance of you answering my simple Yes or No question?  Will you hold hearings?
@ChuckGrassley Did you learn this conducting espionage, planting moles in government offices to obtain political, financial edge?
@ChuckGrassley don't worry, I think Medicare will cover your waaaaaaaambulance.
@ChuckGrassley do your job Grassley and maybe next time you are invited ! #Scalia
@ChuckGrassley - Dems hold secret mtg 2 fight your public obstructionism & U r upset? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley good evening again Senator! Perhaps if you #DoYourJob you would get an invite! Hmmm.. Think @ it 
@ChuckGrassley, You could have been a leader, instead you just followed the Leader. You have no right to complain now. #grassley #SCOTUS
@ChuckGrassley you were invited to the WH, you & Republicans presented nothing and now your complaining about missing a secret meeting?
@ChuckGrassley they didn't invite you because you said you weren't going to do your job anymore. Your legacy is burning
@ChuckGrassley good god, how dare the Dems not invite an R  to a Democratic meeting. You are becoming as shallow as your defunct party
@ChuckGrassley #ChuckGrassley why you try to defy the constitution if you had been invited you would whine that you were invited resign
@ChuckGrassley why, you've made no effort to work with them.  Do your job.
@ChuckGrassley Someone playing #partisan politics does not get to complain about someone else's partisan politics.  #DoYourJobCongress
@ChuckGrassley I think that anyone who says we will not do his job should not complain about others trying to do their job.
@ChuckGrassley just say no!
@ChuckGrassley why does it matter. You said Repubs aren't  going to do anything anyway
@ChuckGrassley ya know, if u weren't stubborn w other repubs u could've had an Iowa judge on SCOTUS. But guess *IOWA* doesn't matter much
@ChuckGrassley maybe if you fuckknuckles hadn't abdicated your responsibility and violated your oaths of office you'd have been invited.
@ChuckGrassley now kindly stop trying to subvert the Constitution, and do your god damn jobs.
@ChuckGrassley why should they? From the moment Obama was elected your party swore an oath to obstructionism.
@ChuckGrassley why in the world wld they invite u? You threw first political tantrum with ur stubborn refusal line. Or was that just talk?
.@ChuckGrassley were those words?
@ChuckGrassley <<== Time to #Resign
@ChuckGrassley Don't be obstructionist and you'd be invited to more meetings.
@ChuckGrassley Do you think you weren't invited because ya'll refused to recognize any candidate he put forward?  Ya think?
@ChuckGrassley We tell them to get lost and they won't even invite us to their meetings now! wahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
@ChuckGrassley they were. Did u miss the memo? Do yr damn job like we're paying u to! #SayNoParty.
@ChuckGrassley wish you'd #DoYourJob

@ChuckGrassley So you could refuse to go? GOP=Goofy Old Pouters
@ChuckGrassley why? you've made it clear you have no intention of doing your constitutionally mandated duty chuck.
