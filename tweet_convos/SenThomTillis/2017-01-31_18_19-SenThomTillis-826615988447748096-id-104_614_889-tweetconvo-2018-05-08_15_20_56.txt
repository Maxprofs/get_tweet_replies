Now more than ever, we need a Justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy & protect fundamental rights.
As your constituent (my zip 27317) I want you to vote against Gorsuch.
unfortunately for you, you didn't vote for him. So....your "constituency " status was left at the ballot box.
you know that's not how this works, right? And GOP's are gunning for Big Bird. For real!
That's precisely how this works. Dems lost and now they can get in the back of the bus.
Classy! Just b/c Sen Tillis is a Rep Senator, doesn't mean...you do have Civics in NC, right?
Classy was 8 yrs of Obamas ramming down his agenda. Hes gone...now it's Repubs time.
so, that's a no. Gotcha!
what was Thom Tillis platform? What did he run on?
the people of NC are TIRED of you and @SenatorBurr IGNORING us and our voices. We won't forget.
he's not ignoring you, he's working for the ppl that voted for him.
he's supposed to be everyone's Senator. Like @POTUS is supposed to be everyone's Prez
Well, except those who boycotted, protested and rioted.
i didnt But @thebaron@405 Dont argue @SenThomTillis isnt ignoring me by saying hes ignoring me for those that voted for him
stop this "holier than thou" crap. American people chose HRC AFTER you too unprecedented action to block Garland
oh get over yourselves HRC is a criminal waiting to be indicted. America is thankful she loss
America chose Clinton.  Is math confusing for you?  Or are you just trolling me?
America chose Trump he got the electoral college or do you not understand how our election works
Russian INTERFERENCE
no that's just more propaganda to undermine the new administration.
I see you have the same views as Trump with regard to our intelligence community. @ActorAaronBooth @SenThomTillis @SenSchumer
I believe the CIA is politicized which is why I don't trust their propaganda
that's why his wife was kicked out of the EPA !
Not for nothing, Senator, a perfect description of Garland, too. Who you blocked for purely partisan reasons.
thank the Biden Rule...Your guy!
of course it is. It isn't a law but Biden established it as a rule of etiquette...when it benefited Dems.
When was it applied?
this picture is the wet dream of George Soros and Barbara Lerner Specter and Senator Schumer because of their end time cult messiah goals.
Jews need to export all muslims out for biblical land grab and rebuilding of temple mount so the messiah returns.
"Fascism Forever" HS club founder "eschews ideology" ... sure :/
Getting a bit tired of this partisan crap. Not cool to block Garland for 9 mos then quote a tweet from @SenSchumer
Yes, but he has a TERRIBLE record on women's rights. Please take a look and vote no.
Protect individual rights/liberties for the people,not  for statism but for our Republic.We are NOT a democracy.
Sure, we NEED more Citizen's United Rulings! + more "Stop the count" votes like FLorida, 2000. Repressive GOP. 
, pretty sure @SenSchumer wasn't talking about Gorsuch; that doesn't sound anything like him. #WeWillResist #newSenatorsforNC
But Betsy DeVos will be horrible for education. VOTE NO!!! #NoonDeVos
.@SenThomTillis @SenSchumer Protect LGBT! Protect a woman's right to HER OWN BODY!
independent?? C'mon. You can't even say that with a straight face.
Gorsuch is certainly qualified but we need a moderate to unite us - not a conservative fringe textualist.
Your Lake Norman neighbor supports Schumer.  NO GARLAND = NO GORSUCH.  You will not take my rights as a woman
you screwed over 28031, 28036, 28078, 28117, 28115 by pocketing Cintra Toll money, you may want to listen to us
Thom, remember Pat McCrory? He lost 33,000 votes last Nov in these zip codes. The I-77 corridor doesn't like you
The Hobby Lobby Decision made the supposedly pious special & better which is ridiculous & a stupid exception.
seems more like the final nail in Liberty's coffin! Just one more part in the DOMINIONIST DICTATORSHIP by RWNJs!
Now, more than ever, we need YOU to stand up and say NO to DeVos. Our children deserve better, Senator.
What about his stance on the rights of women? Does he subscribe to his mother's point of view?  She lasted 22 mos
Does it make you just a teensy bit nervous that McCrory lost? Think about why (I'll help you: bigotry). No to Gorsuch.
Merrick Garland would be better
schumer ia a mutt
yes Exactly. @SenSchumer time to give up the partisan politics. We're all tired of it!
When Schumer voted for him, Gorsuch had not previously been a jurist.
U've got a lil' somethin orange on your nose Sir. Borrow @SenSchumer spine before next election. We're watching ur votes 2.
@SenatorBurr #NotoGorsuch #noDevos #NoSessions From a voting constituent 27616. These ppl won't bring NC into the future.
You guys blocked Obama's pick for 10 months You stole that from those of us who voted for him 2x You dismissed voters' voices
You can't change that now but you can listen to NC educators&vote for NCkids DeVos is unqualified Pls vote no on #DeVosvote
ur snide remarks to @SenSchumer r unacceptable representing NC. I'm ur constituent, where were u when Garland was nominated?
Vote for him, We'll vote YOU out!
Didn't that describe Merrick Garland?  The indignation from Rs on this is insulting and disingenuous.
Facts and Sen Schumer are like oil and water.
@dianeeldredge99 @SenSchumer So true!
But the Media will tell Chucky he can't play and he will shed tears again? Media his Mommy and Mother Knows Best!
@Patriot_MM @SenSchumer Great choice for SCOTUS great job President Trump!
Cowards! Confirm Garland! #constituent #vet #attorney #unseattillis
@HarrietBaldwin @SenSchumer these are the same ppl who converged on your home after all
@HarrietBaldwin @SenSchumer tell your ppl you don't have the votes to obstruct wtfchuck
Block Jeff Sessions’ for AG until he can be Q'd about the legality of the Muslim Ban and the reorg of the NSC w/ Bannon
@mmmoonie #crocodiletears @SenSchumer is more interested in embarrassing himself in front of a camera than governing #SCOTUS
Yes, just like Merrick Garland.  How about we vote on him first?
@michellewally64 @SenSchumer So Neil Gorsuch is an identified conservative. That's an ideal moloch.
What about Merrick Garland???
One word for you Senator, Karma.
when he  opposes protection for women his ideology is misogyny.
True but Shumer is NOT for the U.S.  He's has a psychosis & is detached from reality.  This is why dems lost.
he's fine but you have to stop DeVos, she knows nothing about Public schools that rural NC depends on.
@ChristiChat @SenSchumer Did u not listen to Judge Gorsuch speak? I thought he made that quite clear? Dems need to grow up!
.@SenThomTillis @SenSchumer You mean like Merrick Garland, Senator?
My zip code is 27858. Please provide a link to where I can read documentation supporting this statement
Sen. Schumer I ask you to use whatever means are needed including #filibuster to obstruct as @GOP did @POTUS44
Senator Tillis I ask for you to vote against @POTUS pick for #SCOTUS and do the right thing for NC.
@SenateMajLdr also said top priority was to make @POTUS44 one term President. @GOP are classic hypocrites
@veganvecoh @SenSchumer I know right! So glad we got it now too...glad to see you are starting to see the light there Schumer
Looks like Tillis will have some opposition from his constituents for his reelection. #resist
@LindaSuhler @SenSchumer see if you democrats care about AMERICA 
Hope he's worth losing YOUR job.
how will your support of Gorsuch impact the Massive "Voter Suppression" taking place in NC?
Urging you to say NO to nomination as a resident of NC, disabled person, a mom of two voting age young ladies
We'll consider 45's nomination 4 the next open seat.  This one belongs to Merrick Garland.  @SenateDems please block the vote
the "Senate has several options on how to act — including withholding consideration of a nomination altogether."
Sen:Tillis,you said those words in Aug and unless you're a hypocrite, the options remain.https://goo.gl/pLZGIY 
VOTE NO ON THIS NOMINATION!! THIS IS NOT IN AMERICA'S BEST INTEREST!!
just like you didn't last year? What exactly do you do Thom? Not represent NC.
hey thom you should of let Merrick Garland be confirmed. I'm one of your constituents and you suck.
@layla07122 
@SenSchumer Your Bias Bigotry is Showing!
Schumer changes his stance as often as his pants.  His "concern" over Gorsuch is beyond predictable.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@LindaSuhler @SenSchumer not doing right 4 USA having a temper tantrum y change ur mind now
@LindaSuhler @SenSchumer BOOM!
@LindaSuhler Me thinks @SenSchumer is not aware of this thing called the internet, wherein past statements can be found...
awesome description and even better irony.
I agree, Senator.
@LindaSuhler @SenSchumer embarrassing yourself yet again today Schumer
2006 is hardly= to post-Trumpocolypse 2017. The 10th Cir. is hardly the equivalent of SCOTUS. False analogy!!
as a constituent (27707) I implore you to vote against Gorsuch
As a constituent, Sir, I ask you vote no on Gorsuch. (28277)
No. Garland will be a great SCOTUS. Keep the seat empty!
Thank you Senator Tillis. This North Carolinian is glad to hear you'll support his nomination.
Smells like hypocrisy. Wondering where you sense of preserving democracy was last year? #MerrickGarland
I have never been so disappointed in a North Carolina Senator . Shame on you!
The American people expect your full support for the #SCOTUS Nominee.  @Heritage_Action will key vote this.
Merrick Garland is the reason why he shouldn't.

Perfect description of Merrick Garland!
why not Merrick Garland?
Awesome, tell him to show up at his hearing in a year or so.
bet he doesn't support the right to vote
