As a UNC grad, that's quite lovely but I wish you'd worry more about Tump's ties to Russia since you *ARE* Intel chair
Corruption wins again! Nice job, everyone.

(15) Burr (Senate) and Conaway (House) have scheduled NONE of these 14 people to testify. That means their Russia investigations are a SHAM. 
Meanwhile, Russia.....

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Maybe you can now focus on the #TrumpRussiaInvestigation instead of stonewalling it. Do your job - country before party. #BurrMustRecuse
Treason appears to run deep in the @GOP

(THREAD) Here's a list of Trumpists who LIED about contacts with the Russians and who Congress must therefore SUBPOENA for public testimony. 
And congrats on winning it before Richard Burr allowed his Senate investigation to move forward! Oh, wait- that still gives you YEARS...
Spend your time investigating #TrumpRussia Investigating #TrumpRussia instead of  tweeting about basketball.
Investigating #trumpRUSSIA
This is nice. Too bad any injuries these kids had will ruin insurance for them, thanks to your nightmare repeal/replace. Shame on you all.
You guys are so busy Russian around!
Love the #Tarheels but this is not where your time needs to be spent. We need real progress on #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
#DoYourJob
Glad you can pass a bill that is so important to you. Now how about doing your job on the Intel Committee. You know, the bipartisan one!
Do NC residents know Russian oligarchs are gamin' to hijack eastern US power grid via Alevo?
So we have 3-4 Russians executives, the US power grid & one of the world's most powerful computers. I'm sure this is fine.
@maddow @maddow @nytimes @CNN @washingtonpost  RUN THIS STORY!!!!!! #RussianPowerGrid #BurrRecuses #TraitorGOP #ANGRYAMERICANS #REVOLT
My daughter wants to apply to UNC but I refuse to spend my hard earned $$ in NC with people like you in Office!
Why are you colluding with Russia against Americans?
Seriously? Go Tarheels, but you need to be investigating #Trumprussia and the #PutinPuppet #DoYourJob
Congrats on proveable academic fraud as well.

Keep in mind: Rep. Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team and Sen. Burr was a member of Trump's Nat Sec Advisory Council. 7/ 
Yay UNC. But you are fiddling while your career burns down around your ears. Russia and now the AHCA. Your seat is BLUE next election.
Time to provide information about trump's illegal activities to intelligence agencies. We must clean house. Traitors among us. #trumpRussia
Hey that's great...now what about taxes, healthcare and the rest of what you we're elected to do...Yes I vote NC!!!
Have you officially requested docs needed for Russia investigation? If not, when do you plan to do that? We need you to keep your word.
Glad you have so much time on your hands to get this passed.

Remember when Burr took the side of Russia in the Boston Bombing case? #BurrMustRecuse http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/25/did-the-fbi-bungle-the-tsarnaev-case/ …

Good lord can you people do something that's actually worthwhile?
Why are other Senate committees so far ahead of yours?  Please do your job or step aside.
#TrumpRussiaInvestigation - ever hear of it?

#TheResistance
#ncpol
The Senate needs to finish the investigations !
How bout you do your god damn job, get to the bottom of #RussiaGate and stop tweeting bullshit. #RussiaGate
Yeah, basketball, so how is that Trump/Russia investigation coming along?
Gee, UNC basketball, woohoo. You're colluding with the Russian colluders, aren't you?
Congratulations on getting something passed in the Senate. Now let's work on something more important than basketball and post offices.

Don't you have other pressing issues to address? Maybe the Trump collusion investigation and hopefully impeachment? But #ncaa comes 1st
While the heels are amazing, let's not forget what your colleague, Helms called my Alma mater. The Senate should work on laws that are REAL.
How's that Russia thing going.  Doesn't seam lime you're doing much.  Maybe you're too busy so you should step down.
#russiagate #wearewatching
#russiagate
You do know there are 15 D1 teams in NC that hate UNC-CH, & they vote, don't you?
Sadly, I don't think you're joking. You should give yourself a raise for working so hard. Meanwhile, I'll keep paying a fortune to BCBSNC.
Why don't you stop worrying about basketball and do the job you were elected to do? Or are you bought and paid for by Trump/Putin? Traitor.
Recuse, resign.  #Trumprussia
U AND THE OTHER REPUBLICANS BETTER STEP UP AND FOLLOW OUR POTUS LEAD TO KEEP HIS PROMISES R U WILL NOT BE REELECTED. PERIOD!!
Do your f****** job start the investigation
Why is this necessary? And why do you have time for this?
Do your job and investigate Russia's meddling in our elections. #youworkforus
Awesome. Now hire a real staff for the Russia investigation. Our democracy deserves answers one way or the other.
YEEEHAW GOHEELS
I like the resolution...please do better to serve the state and pass MEANINGFUL resolutions
we are waiting on those documents on Russia investigation,

Hey, get off twitter and start investigating Trump. History will remember you as a traitor if you don't get it together.


Not to mention Burr won't sign papers requesting docs from trump WH. Again - this is called obstruction of justice. #BurrMustRecuse https://twitter.com/funder/status/857230382164520960 …
Focus on Russia! Thanks, Fellow N. Carolinian and Duke fan aka Taxpayer that didn't vote for you
We're going to pass a resolution to vote you out of office if you don't do your job and investigate #trumpRussia! #morallyrepugnantGOP
Thank you Senator and please tell @POTUS he has done a great job his first 100 days.  #MAGA
Wow, you do take on the really important stuff don't you?
Go Heels!
Okay? How about doing better at your investigation?We know you benefit (personally) from this not going forward.DO.YOUR.JOB!
How about some updates on Senate Intelligence Committee work???
Senate  needs  to  focus  on  Russia  investigation,  not  basket  ball
Meanwhile, some of us are still waiting for you to figure out health care. Specifically Medicaid for children with special needs.
Don't bother. Burr doesn't respond to his constituents.
Good for them and all, but seriously, WE CARE ABOUT #TRUMPTUSSIA and the threat collusion poses to our democracy!! #investigatetrump
Great, does Senate think this to more important than Russian hacking US election????
It's starting to look like you might be complicit in the Trump/Russian scandal. If you aren't, do your damn job! All of N.C. Is watching
Yes WE ARE! 
Wow, good job, senators! Very busy doing the people's business, I see.
This is stupid waste of Senate time. Seriously.
While basketball is great, there are some real Constitutional crises going on. You haven't done your job in #russiagate. So #BurrMustRecuse
You must want to go back to selling lawn equipment. That's fine with us. Resign now - or at least recuse yourself from the IC.
THIS is what you are working on? Vote no on that lethal healthcare bill.
Get busy on Russia.
#BurrMustRecuse 
#TrumpRussia
#TrumpCoverup
Everybody hates on you because you swamp of D.C. Get nothing done
You need to get behind the President and pass some bill for the American people not basketball
#DoYourJob and investigate #Russian interference in our election, our democracy needs to be protected!
That's great. Now please sign some subpoenas and show us you take National Security seriously.

You should spend more time recognizing the number of acts of Russian collusion within the Trump administration
Unbelievable that Congress has time to waste on such stupidity !!!
.
UR tweeting about BBall when the government is swarming w/ #trumpRussia & traitors?  RECUSE yourself so we can get a REAL investigation!!

A member of one of Israel’s wealthiest families has been funding Jared Kushner’s business. http://nyti.ms/2oMwf78  

New report by @nytimes links Jared Kushner to secret busin partner, Beny Steinmetz, who has affiliations w/ Alfa Group & #Russia oligarchs. 
FOCUS ON #russiagate.  We have ESPN that can keep us up to date on basketball
Again, looking for you to support the science of Heels as well. Publicly renounce President's proposed cuts to science and public health
How about trumprussia??  Recuse and resign!!!
Why are you doing this instead of investigating Trump-Russia? Stop stalling & do your job!
Oh no! Not u 2! Letting us down n ur home town. Are all of the GOP involved in Russian $? This is horrible! No wonder u haven't stepped up
seriously? This is ur priority? How about do ur job & hold hearings on #trumprussia
I love @UNC but where are we on #Trumprussia? Signed docs yet? Recused yourself? PS its 7 not 6 national championships. #BurrMustRecuse
resign!!
Go to work on Russian collusion with your boss
That's awesome! Now will you sign letters with @MarkWarner seeking evidence in #RussiaGate? #GDTBATH #godoyourjob
Sen Burr, we have 7 Nat'l champs in Men's BB. 6 are NCAA, 1 predates NCAA. 1924, '57, '82, '93, '05, '09, '17
Trump Russia.  Everything else can wait.
DO YOUR JOB AND INVESTIGATE TRUMP! If I didn't do my job I would get fired. You should be too.
Cool. So what's up with the #TrumpRussia investigation? Did you subpoena for documents yet?
Playtime is over. Recuse yourself immediately and let the Russia investigation proceed!
THIS was important bt u cannot investigate @potus and russia connection? Recuse urself it's obvious POTUS has free reign with u #treason
You must be so proud! Much more important accomplishment than say investigate Russian hacking and Trump-Russia collusion in election! #Sad
My sentiments exactly!
Let's get down the real business at hand  #TrumpRussia Sick and tired of your incompetence. #Ω #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
OK great. Now Senator please focus your efforts on the Russian questions rel. to POTUS
And this is more important to you than Putin/Russian collusion in our government?  I am in NC and I am appalled at your incompetence.  #Ω
Stop stonewalling the Russia investigation. Do your job - country over party. When will u have a townhall?  Been waiting a long time. 
As much as I enjoy Tarheel basketball how about a resolution that canx the exemption the Congress and their staff has on healthcare

As a freshman Senator-Richard Burr took taxpayer-funded trips to Russia, China & the Middle East=$19,200

#BurrMustRecuse #trumprussia 
the senate just passed a resolution that you don't have to subscribe to trumpcare.  well this is telling.

#BREAKING: Senator Richard Burr would directly profit off sanctions being lifted on Russia

#BurrMustRecuse #trumprussia #russiagate #resist 
Congrats @UNC_Basketball  But did we need a resolution for that?  Is this what we're paying you to do?
Get to work on your investigation. Stop this party over country crap.
Don't you have more pressing issues to focus on? Don't get me wrong, I love the Tarheels, but start investigating the election meddling.
DO your JOB Senator, or get the hell out of the way!  #Trumprussia
https://twitter.com/spooney35/status/855892063266590720 … recuse yourself from Russia Investigation..?ties
