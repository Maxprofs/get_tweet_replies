Guess you're not  interested in what your constituents think. Yes we're real @arobotti @RISETogether_NC @dittmeriq
AND I'm still not being paid!
.@SenThomTillis @nananw True, but you're just a #RINO.  #Trump won, so get on board with repealing #ACA, tax cuts, and #BuildTheWall
If you care about law, you'll  support S 65 to investigate conflicts of interest. Nonpartisan issue of integrity and law.
I thought last year it was decided #SCOTUS needed only eight justices.
Um no, we need not to be locked in ties.
you lnow who else would have made a great justice? MERRICK GARLAND! #Annoyed
Tell us why. Stop the vapid responses.
Can't wait to talk to you during your town hall next week!  Oh, youre #cowardly not having one
What kinda Justice accepts a stolen seat?
We demand a townhall!
ugh you are the worst.
Too bad you wontbe there long to work with him...#onetermthom

You are just a rubber stamp for Trump.
how would you explain the fact that he founded "Fascists Forever" when he was in college?
Thank you for your service to our great state. Judge Gorsuch is impeccably qualified. Advise and consent and let him serve!
You NEVER met with Garland, did you!? Hypocrite.
I'm willing to bet that most people who actually voted for Thom expect him to support Gorsuch 
Why couldn't this have taken place last year???

THANKS SEN THOM TILLIS FOR CARIN ABOUT NC AND AMERICA BLESS YOU SIR
I assume you are one of the GOP faithful who decided not to accept a hearing on President Obama's nomination.
can you address the  elephant in the room?
looking forward to you hosting a town hall meeting recess in NC during upcoming Congressional recess- best post time&adapted
Great.  Thanks for your service. fcarter, Clemmons NC.   @imgolfer
Does Gorsuch think he has the right to tell me what to do with my body?
maybe you can look into all of the unethical conflicts of interest involved in this administration next.
how did your meeting go with Judge Garland?
That's right. "No" isn't in your vocabulary.
would have been nice if you had the decency or respect for your office to meet with Merrick Garland.
A productive meeting with your constituents, though? #waiting #listening
@sistertoldjah Why is @MitchMcConell saying no confirmation hearings until April?
how did your meeting with Merrick Garland go??
I look forward to voting you out of office soon (alas, not soon enough)
Town hall, please.  I can guarantee you I'd show up.

Everybody is watching. Have a Town Hall. Face us coward. Or hide in DC and be voted out

.@SenThomTillis take your confirmation and shove it #yourlastterm
wait, isn't that Judge Garland's seat? You will regret the day you set his precedent. The GOP won't always be in majority.
Please keep in mind #CorporationsAreNotPeople!! And Women Need Access to Healthcare 100%, including family planning!!
it's a #StolenSeat that belongs to Merrick Garland. But you know this because you place politics over country. #RubberStamp
let's have a #townhallmeeting.

that man should not be confirmed as SCOTUS, you should be ashamed.
please don't vote for him. We need someone strongly committed to the separation of powers and I fear he is not that person

our judges need to be non-partisan. Please make sure that happens.
Sir, please schedule a #TownHall to allow your constituents to voice their concerns-- and hear your thinking.
vote for him and we will vote u out. Be warned. Listen to your constituents. We're pissed off
Pls consider signing a petition asking for @SenThomTillis townhalls- Sign & retweet! #TheResistance
done
this constituent fully supports your vote FOR Judge Gorsuch.
What happened to you on that DeVos vote? Disappointing.
Too bad you never gave Judge Garland the same courtesy. Partisan hack.
CONFIRM ASAP. Suspend the philibuster if you have to. Time to start acting like a democrat.
DeVos is probably going to hire you to teach based on your spelling lol
I sincerely hope not. Town hall?
No, we don't. Merrick Garland should already be in that seat. #resist
Are you sure? No doubt a sharp legal mind, but worry he'll let his personal politics leak into his desicion making.
Like the 9th Circuit?
As your constituent (27317), I want you to vote NO as to Gorsuch.  He ruled that a corporation is a person re civil rights.
start listening to who voted you in
nice of u 2 meet w Judge Gorsuch, just like u met with Judge Merrick Garland! Not!
When you visit @BetsyDeVos be sure to take her some pencils
Right after Merrick Garland, xoxoxo.
Are you planning on having a town hall during the upcoming recess? Your constituents have many things to say to you.
I hope you are right Senator Tillis.
