@SenatorLankford @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump @GOPoversight   Most of Country does NOT like McCain for good reasons
Vote No on this healthcare mess. And #TrumpRussia is exploding so now would be a good time to focus on our democracy.
Are you kidding? No-just avoiding the real issues. Vote no on #trumpcare and get moving on #impeachment. The truth matters.
Seriously? Get over it snowflake. He's our presidentand were gonna keep him!!
If @potus wants to do what's right he should rehire @PreetBharara
Idiot
Illegitimate Pres so no real nominee
Idiot
Just checking in to see if you are going to demand that Jared Kushner's  security clearance be revoked. Or will it be crickets? 
Have you lost your mind? No nominations approved until Trump is cleared. What are you thinking?
They don't think. They politic.
Actually it seems more like they POLITIK
NO to #Trumpcare, YES to #ImpeachTrump . No nominations approved while the investigation is ongoing.
Nice tweet, Yvgeny The Motherland is proud.
Yeah, what about collusion and treason? How do you 'stand' on that one? Or is it merely 'disturbing'?
Found a nice pic of you Senator Burr! Enjoy!
Well how bout making him AG if he's not a Clinton donor and deep state member.  POTUS could use some justice and congress not helping.

GOP/trumpcare is bad for NC and the country. Stop wrecking Obamacare, it works for me and many many many N. Carolinians. Vote NO
So is Putin pleased as well? You work for NC stop supporting and making excuses for trump. You are INVESTIGATING him for God's sake!
so you're both a No vote on tax break for wealthy & death panels for regular citizens? Country over party boys!
You need to change the laws for how executive staff gets security clearances immediately!
#TrumpRussia
#Corruption
Good grief get over it. Russia is a nothing burger!!!
Get that crook out of the WH, there will be a revolution like you have never seen before. We the People demand it. Morality of this country
Idiot
Another smarmy NC Republican
Do the Right Thing Now for us!  You were not elected to be a Votary!  You were elected to be a Leader!!!  Do The Right Thing!
Obamacare allowed me to afford Ins and keep on farming. Providing food to NC instead of working at Sheetz. GOP plan hurts small biz growth
NC employer pre OCare offered "health ins" to workers. Fine print read- "this not a replacement for primary health ins". Dont send us back

@SenatorLankford @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump @GOPoversight  Have to ask WHY he received Trump Dossier; goes to FBI
@SenatorLankford @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump @GOPoversight  

Always too many questions on McCain. Even have clot?
@SenatorLankford @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump @GOPoversight  Never liked or trusted McCain
Please explain to your constituents here in NC why Jared Kushner  still has a security clearance!?? 
No more Republican Party Trump has allowed Russians to take it over it now the Russian Party "Good Old Putin" Party thanks to Trump
Idiot
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. Do the right thing, vote no on #brca and yes on #ImpeachTrumpNow
Idiot
Yes- POLITIKS as usual right Senator? Tax cuts for wealthy, pain for everyone else. GOP blueprint for USA, Kremlin approved
When will you be pleased to stop supporting Prezydent Kompromat, a traitor to the United States of America??
Humpty Trumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Trumpty will take a GREAT fall
All the king's horses & all the king's men

Well you know the rest @GOP
He was also rebuked because they had failed to correct trial testimony they knew to be false.
Not a man to praise or promote.
Federal appeals court judges issued a blistering rebuke about how prosecutors under Higdon’s leadership had withheld evidence.
It's so disappointing what a waste of a senator you are! You really don't give a shit about any of your constituents, huh?
@SenatorLankford  WHO's running the Circus Show? I keep seeing Mark Warner on shows pulling all the strings? Whos in Charge? Start acting it
@SenatorBurr When you were at @WakeForest, was #ProHumanitate a thing? TrumpCare is the least humane thing you could do to NC & America.
So a shame of both you and Burr, you have made you deals to make your money, in spite of what is best for the country!  How can you hate so?
Surely, but not so much Tom Farr as a Federal Judge. His record or gerrymandering and voter suppression a disqualifyer.
If you can't guarantee the President did Not commit Criminal Conspiracy with Russia You must take action to revoke security clearance of (1)
(2) of Kushner & you must pass the BIPARTISAN 98 to 2 bill not allowing POTUS to lift sanctions on Russia
@SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley  @realDonaldTrump 

Hillary, Lynch, Obama, Rice, Holder 

#LockThemUp
I have contacted an attorney about suing  you for not representing your constituents. You don't take calls or hold townhalls, you need 2 go.
@SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley  @realDonaldTrump 

All this time and NONE of you going after Dems!
@SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley  @realDonaldTrump 
 
YOU must see the truth!
Richard Burr Protects Trump From Russia Probe-Then HIS Russian Financial Ties Surface #SpinelessRepublicans #Traitor
Are your pleased that the healthcare bill if passed will send many to an early grave?
No noms should be approved until #TrumpRussia is sorted out. If it's nothing, it's just a delay; if it's something, the country is defended.
#DoNothingGOP
richard burr forgets who he represents. I'll remind him:The American people/his constituents not trump&Russian. burr sold out Country for $s
The richest country in the world should not have the worse healthcare. Vote NO on ACA repeal.
Please vote no! We are counting on you! Do the right thing...otherwise you will have to live with this the rest of your life #Karma
'Simply Unworkable': Insurers Blast New Provision In Senate Health Bill

BCBS is agaist Cruz amendment and they are 1 of the few providers left. Also no specials to but certain statea
Citizens of NC want ACA so fix it! Rural areas like Belhaven have already lost their hospitals.

No on Trumpcare
Too bad Patricia Timmons-Goodson and Jennifer May-Parker didn't get that courtesy when they were nominated 2 b judges in the same district!

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Are you pleased with @POTUS , Russia? Taking insurance from millions? Embarrassing our country?
Lets Support @POTUS period! Letting the Sen minority leader lead you in this investigation is a GD disgrace! GROW a damn spine or step down!
Great!  Let's keep pushing the President's agenda. Jobs numbers looking good. The stock market is at all time highs. #RepealAndReplace
Stop bragging, investigate Hillary clinton
Get a healthcare bill passed and stop obstructing his other noms.
See how no one cares. NC wants you to #SaveHealthcare and #SaveMedicaid Why don't you go to work on that? Oh wait, you've already decided...
I don't think you will listen to us.
That traitorous POS didn't choose anyone.He knows no one of substance.  Someone else made the choice for him. He's Putin's cock holster.
You do not care about people!
Support @POTUS 
Support @POTUS 
Support @POTUS

Oh, and uh, kill #Obamacare
I beg you please get rid of Obamacare.
Stay faaaarrr away from single payer
Get Gov out of healthcare all together
It's time to separate yourself.  #NoToHealthcareBill #SaveLives #MedicaidCuts #NCVoter #Ethics
This president can do a lot of good for our country if the republicans will only give him support instead of working against him. Try it.
the Cruz amendment is unworkable!
JUST IN: The nation's actuaries have spoken: the Cruz amendment is totally unworkable, will destabilize the markets.

Idiot
Sure looks like your pleased with Trump and his family being so involved with Russia too. Time to step up boys and say enough is enough.
Pleased with his nominations is like being pleased with him. Y'all are enabling his narcissism and treachery.
You both need to vote NO on this terrible healthcare bill!
Sir...please tell your colleagues to just repeal O'Care now! Do not replace! Gov shouldn't be in healthcare. Freedom of choice and market!
You follow Trump you are a RUSSIAN
Senate Burr is a Russian now
Why don't U wrap up your witch hunt @SenatorBurr Stop wasting taxpayer $$ This has gone on how long now based on Lie DT never investigated


President under FBI investigation .. don't be stupid .. 

Dance clown ..
and I, of course, would be over the moon pleased if you boys had a town hall. let your voters know date time & place.  vote no on trumpcare.
ditto!

Beware of supporting anything trump endorses. You too will sink into the morass he has caused. He's a #BadDad #impeachtrump
2 SUSPICIOUS DEATHS IN AMERICA WITH TIES TO RUSSIAGATE, BE CAREFUL, THIS IS RUSSIA' WAY OF CLEANING UP!
Nothing that's going on bothers you, @SenatorBurr ? You seem to be OK with the mess in the White House.
What do you do when your investigation establishes collusion? Say, "yeah, there was collusion, but so what?"
A months long investigation into something you don't think matters.  Next time, investigate what Adam Sandler had for lunch
Come election day, #WeThePeople will remember! That goes for you too @RepDavidRouzer We will REMEMBER your 'talk' and failure to ACT!
Meh, too much Russian stuff
