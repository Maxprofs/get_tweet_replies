@NFL @Panthers every one got to watch this game! Go panthers! !
@NFL @Panthers when you lose your previous season next yr is always easier. Lets see them go 11-0 next yr when they face a tougher schedule
@D24sports @NFL @Panthers I agree. Next year will be harder but they did win their division last year. Read up on facts before you post :)
@Jortz_M there is abig difference between losing the season and winning your division. They lost their season by finishing under 500
@D24sports They won their division in 2013 too with a 12-4 record. Losing their previous season doesn't always make things tougher
@NFL @Panthers who would've known that being "the first undefeated team to lose" would result in being the ONLY one left  #KeepPounding
@NFL you gave them and easy schedule and aren't even in the AFC
@ElyseWorth @NFL are you stupid? There are no easy games in the NFL any team can be beat on any given Sunday.
@NFL @Panthers so then why are we below 10-1 in the image?
@TrapCahn @NFL can i frame this tweet ?!?
@NFL so many salty patriot fans lmao
@NFL @Panthers go Panthers
@NFL @braydenoneal11 @Panthers
@NFL props to the Panthers but the NFL is doing all they can to make Patriots lose. Your refs make figure skating judges look objective
@NFL @Panthers so what???
@NFL @Patriots I wake up to this & it just makes me sad: #Gronk injured, #PatriotsNation with a loss. How will I make it through the day?!?
@defelilo @NFL @Patriots Get a life!
@NFL @Panthers they are not good!
@NFL @Panthers the panthers dont have to play Goodell's refs every game along with an opposing team
@xibfreshx @NFL @Panthers You obviously don't watch all the panthers games.
@NFL solid refereeing again.
@LifeofRyan_ @NFL back up QB
@NFL @Panthers Don't you mean 11 - 0?

@NFL @Panthers 
@NFL Too bad if you didn't have refs that took blowjobs for calls, the Pats would still be undefeated.
@NFL @Panthers Panthers is Raw but Seahawks is better overall
@NFL @Panthers the panthers don't have to play against the refs every sunday either
@NFL @Panthers And still!!
@NFL @Panthers 
Aren't they 11-0? Cause the pic says 10-1....
@NFL @Panthers You forgot to mention your referees are, as always, undefeated.
@NFL I am guessing you are really happy about that. How much was the "bonus" for those refs?
@NFL @Panthers They have some tough completion coming up.....
@NFL @Panthers this looks mighty fine!
@NFL @Panthers Cheater Goodell

@NFL @Panthers @ThaDinger14 Pats are garbage, can't even go 11-0.
@WhiteHammer69 Wud up Bama fan
@ThaDinger14 Could beat the Pats easy.
@NFL @Panthers Lets wait until Playoffs aha

@NFL @Panthers I mean, if the Patriots managed to go undefeated with the amount injuries that they had, I would have been amazed.
@NFL @Panthers do they play Denver,?
@NFL worst 11-0 in history!   Hahahaha!!!!
@NFL @Panthers couldn't be happier
@NFL NFL, is this the correct graphic you wanted to tweet...? #notapanthersfan #justaneditor
@NFL @Panthers
@NFL @Panthers false, the refs are. @stoolpresidente
@NFL The Carolina @Panthers should be an automatic @superbowl50 team. I know, it unfortunately does not work that way, though. Play to 16-0.
@SacKingRepublic @NFL @Panthers @superbowl50 this might just be the most idiotic tweet of the night.
@huntinazbro @NFL @Panthers @superbowl50 I'll let @TheNouj be the judge of that. It could be the #BankOfTheWest #TweetOfTheNight on @ABC10.
@NFL @Panthers nice win tonight Roger!!
@NFL EACH OTHERS URUTHRAD
@NFL @rymathieson @Panthers feels good to be recognized!!
@Antoeless @NFL @Panthers thought they would lose first before the patriots so yeah I give them credit

@NFL If there is NO recourse against these crappy REFS then there is going to be NO stopping this TERRIBLE REFEREEING the rest of the year
@NFL I've seen so many bad calls today and tonight in the Pats game and I'm not even a Pats fan. But if you don't start deducting money from
@NFL @Panthers @harriuh_
@NFL @Panthers Broncos play the refs every game so
@Isacervs @NFL @Panthers you guys sleep.
@NFL @Panthers but they didn't have the refs rig the game now did they?
@NFL make no mistake, the league has been tarnished beyond repair on the last years and the glory days are over
@NFL how about making these refs more accountable for horrible officiating
@NFL @Panthers a lot of people eating crow tonight saying the pats are the best unbeaten team haha #PantherNation #KeepPounding
@NFL @Panthers yessssss
@NFL @Panthers 
@NFL Been waiting for that huh?!? What are the chances that Goodell hands the trophy to Kraft?
@NFL good math. Now maybe you can do something about the refs.
@NFL @Panthers True and Brady is the only active QB with 4 Superbowl rings.
@NFL @Panthers 
@NFL @Panthers thanks to the bullshit Denver refs and the bullshit @nflcommish
@NFL @Panthers and they have played 1 team with a winning record just saying...
@haney_peyton @NFL @Panthers They have played 4 just saying....
@NFL @Panthers plzz do it fire them all
@NFL
Great job it only took 11 weeks for the commish to exact his bitterness in yet ANOTHER horribly officiated game.. Bravo
@NFL @Panthers fuck them! Guess they will win SB cause Goodell wants a two bit franchise to expand the game.
@NFL @Panthers will lose too, even the good ones fall
@NFL @Panthers WEAK SCHEDULE benefits you guys, no DEN,AZ,SEA,PATS,MINN

@NFL @Panthers maybe its divine justice the 12 cheap in new england supported by nfl
@NFL @Panthers Yo lemme ask you a question why dont you want the Pats to win superbowl??
