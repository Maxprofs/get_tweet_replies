@SenateMajLdr Promise delayed: #ZadrogaAct. #WorstResponders
@SenateMajLdr  Pass the 9/11 Zadroga Act. Now. #worstresponders #shameworks  Do something.

@SenateMajLdr Come up with something better than the ACA before you dismantle whatever progress has been made. Don't be foolish.
@SenateMajLdr what about promise to 9/11 responders #WorstResponders #ZadrogaAct
@SenateMajLdr  first responders and mass shooting victims now have less options to survive wounds #WorstResponders #301sinceColumbine
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs on please stop stalling gov work together. Leave ACA alone we have bigger issues
@SenateMajLdr @LanceSilver1 then do something about the illegals and Syrians flooding in. You were given a mandate by Americans. Do your job
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs back at same old shit . For years this is all you have done ., making sure Americans don't have insurance.
@SenateMajLdr #GOP #Senate #Obamacare #backtowork How about doing something useful instead?
@SenateMajLdr promise kept: you wasted more American taxpayer money to pass a bill you know will fail! #backtowastingmoney
@SenateMajLdr Please make it right. #WorstResponders
@SenateMajLdr Get off Obamacare and do your job!!!
.@SenateMajLdr never gonna get through, #wasteoftime but that Zadroga Act needs to get passed #worstresponders
@SenateMajLdr Why do you strive to repeal Obamacare if you created a system in Kentucky similar to it. Do you only care about Kentuckyans?
@SenateMajLdr what about your promise to the 9-11 workers???? #gettowork and pass the funding bill.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Great-now let stop ALL immigration for 10-15 yrs
@SenateMajLdr #worstresponders
@SenateMajLdr promise wasn't "pass a bill" it was "repeal obamacare" promise not kept !
@SenateMajLdr You have had NOTHING to do with people getting #backtowork Stop trying to take credit. ACA helps people, just not your people.
@SenateMajLdr Do you are as shocked who don't care about the  poor we get it
@SenateMajLdr Try passing a law the majority of people want instead of repealing one that the majority of people want.
@SenateMajLdr Hope you're proud to be putting millions of folks back to zero. Leadership like this we don't need. What is the replacement
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Back to work trying to kill people?
@SenateMajLdr but will you fight for it come budget time?  Omnibus ??  or is this just for show, yet again ?  #pjnet @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan
@SenateMajLdr   THANK YOU for the repeal vote on #Obamacare it has been a hardship on me, my family and many ppl I know.
@SenateMajLdr As long as that work doesn't include protecting innocent Americans from gun violence, right? #ownedbyNRA #SanBernadino
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs take down health care but keep guns flowing to those who shouldn't have them...
@SenateMajLdr FINALLY THE SENATE IS DOING SOMETHING!  With this, the planned parenthood defunding & highway bill - now that gives us hope!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs where were you when it started ; idiot 
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Makes sense. Why should we support something that works for the people. Love your "Let them die" attitude
@SenateMajLdr @SenThomTillis And armed terrorists.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs you are a sorry excuse  for a human being you need to get out of Congress
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr I’m embarassed to be a registered republican.  No more. You have failed America. How about promising to save lives. Gun reform
@SenateMajLdr @MattMackowiak How much of our money has been spent on these "repeals"?? I would like to sue Congress to get the money back.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs oh yay! AGAIN! #ridiculouswaytheGOPwastestime
@SenateMajLdr @RonSantoFan 
Finally a little sign of life. Etablishment!
Karl Rove on NPR..You are getting desperate. To little to late.
@SenateMajLdr useless posturing NRA lackey
@dorocren @SenateMajLdr He did this too.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Big deal. Means nothing. Wasted your time. You all in the senate must think we are idiots.
@SenateMajLdr Why didn't you support Rand Paul's bill to reduce Syrian refugees?
@SenateMajLdr We should have Trump/Cruz run for office more often.U shouldn't need shaming to do your job. STOP OBAMA @Senate_GOPs
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr @JRubinBlogger
But...what have you ...accomplished?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs hey McConnell, you're a money worshipping, war mongering, divisive SOB. Happy Holidays 
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs I'll believe it when it happens. Keeping our fingers crossed.
@SenateMajLdr @MattMackowiak You refuse to kill it when you auth. spending for it Today's vote nothing more than boob bait for the bubbas
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Senate Democrats To Hold #Republicans Accountb By Forcing Vote On #Gun Amend http://www.politicususa.com/2015/12/02/senate-democrats-hold-republicans-accountable-forcing-vote-gun-amendment.html … #NRAKills
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs - What work? Further destroying America? I love how you "repeal" this law without putting anything in its place.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Awesome..! We the people say Repeal all the garbage Obama has set forth. He's radical in every way! God Bless US!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Get ready for a presidential veto. You are wasting time. The ACA is here to stay, it's working.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs LOL. Did you think Senate passage meant it was law?
@SenateMajLdr Good start. Next step is for you to resign.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs why don't you guys do something useful instead of repealing obamacare every other day?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs This will be vetoed. *yawn* to another meaningless, political move. How about some gun sense?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs  You have the nerve to pat yourself on the back- ya RINO POS
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Please step down as leader.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs You're not done yet. Go take care of those 9/11 heroes and our veterans!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs what are you replacing it with? 
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Repealing Obamacare is your top priority and not guns... you are evil.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs get votes to prevent veto. Then move to impeach
@senatemajldr @senate_gops #Obamacare @GOP 
So in stroke of pen, you took our health insurance away and sold us to Aetna and UHC!!!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs haven't you already wasted years and millions of our dollars.?  Same old same old GOP
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs nice try Mitch but everyone knows you'll throw republicans under the bus to appear to be goeverning.
@SenateMajLdr For all the left comments on mass shootings.  Mass shootings have skyrocketed under Obama's reign.  FYI...
@SenateMajLdr Thank you, sir - and your colleagues. I'm still skeptical, but this does help.
@SenateMajLdr But will you follow through.  And let the ignorant left know what alternatives are out there, because they believe in lies.
@SenateMajLdr @JRubinBlogger Happy #teaparty !!
@SenateMajLdr Congrats on achieving literally nothing.
@JimmyTiktaalik @SenateMajLdr That is the senate. They are just lining their own pockets. They really don't care about the people.
@AmeliaPool @SenateMajLdr #Stupid unsubstantiated comment #EyeKnowU #TryMe #CrashnBurn
@SenateMajLdr u know this bill is dead in the water and cannot survive the veto u r just flapping ur lips in the wind
@SenateMajLdr just like republican 2b proud of snatching healthcare from millions,cancer pts, chronic sick and poor.God bless ur sorry souls
@senatemajldr Why can't we get the prez to sign in a political manuever? That's the promise of leadership -- enactment
@SenateMajLdr too bad it's just going to get vetoed. I swear, I look forward to living in a country where elected officials actually serve.
@SenateMajLdr @GOP AGAIN??TRYING TO SCREW TO POOR PEOPLE ? DAMN IT 30 VOTES ALREADY TO DO SAME BULLSHIT..OBAMA WILL VETO YOUR CRAP
@SenateMajLdr That's a start. Thank you. Use that Kentucky grit and get stuff done.
@SenateMajLdr @kyleraccio I doubt this. Proly only repealed 1 sm tiny part that was of no use, like they did the last times it was repealed.
@SenateMajLdr It's not even laughable anymore, it just unbelievably stupid.
@senatemajldr thank god. that way when I get shot on the street by a crazy with a legally purchased gun, I won't be able to pay my med bills
@SenateMajLdr Good start. Now to defund executive amnesty
@kyleraccio @SenateMajLdr http://www.occupydemocrats.com/stewart-mcconnell-should-be-ashamed-of-himself-for-blocking-911-first-responders-bill/ … He soldout the 911 Responders for oil money.
Good. Now pass one against executive amnesty.

@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr Good job!!
