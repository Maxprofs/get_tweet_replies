@SpeakerRyan politicians have a way to try to twist wrong into right but conservatives see clearly how wrong this bill is for our country.
@SpeakerRyan I do not even have the words to say how very disappointed I am about you not fighting for us.

@SpeakerRyan b.s. - you failed conservatives BIG TIME !!
@SpeakerRyan EXCUSES, EXCUSES! An excuse only satisfies the person making.

@SpeakerRyan This Bill Sucks! Massive spending, sanctuary city's, PPH funding I thought you would be differentJust another Obummer butt boy.

@SpeakerRyan @twright55 You sound as ridiculous as Jeb Bush or even Hillary Clinton. We need Trump now more then ever. Bye bye traitors
@SpeakerRyan  WTF is more important oil exports or National Security? Guess you already answered that, RINO. I used to like you.
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner  honestly from reports even though the omnibus spending bill may have good conservative things it was a pos.
@SpeakerRyan 
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner wrong. Looking forward to your primary challenge.
@SpeakerRyan 1.6 billion dollars to fund immigrants while you voted against veterans and seniors every time. You are all BS.
@SpeakerRyan -txs for the list, but do they out-weight the losses by R's.
@SpeakerRyan  for a moment, I thought I heard you say big win. Must have been a. nightmare
@SpeakerRyan An awful lot of spending for a fiscal hawk like yourself. Quit trying to sugar coat it, YOU SOLD US OUT.
@SpeakerRyan and even my re sad compromises and losses.
@SpeakerRyan A win for this Country would be a government that only acts within the Constitutional framework
 That ship has sailed.
@SpeakerRyan 
Dude, the sleepers have awaken. You are the same song different day as the last guy. Boomers will never, never buy it.

@SpeakerRyan I promise to work an extra five hours every week next year so you can have more taxes #fireRyan #replaceRyan #Trump2016
@SpeakerRyan except allowing the export of US oil is a bad one for Americans!
@SpeakerRyan to be honest... the think the country should come before the conservatives... right? you do want for the people... right?
@SpeakerRyan patting yourself on the back after sticking a knife in ours #RINO
@SpeakerRyan please let us know whats in the bill. An educated electorate is important. It builds trust between lawmakers & constituents.
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner a better win would be forcing @Councilofdc to respect the 2nd Amendment rights of DC residents
@SpeakerRyan Yes..your donors got their paybacks. Donors over voters. Traitor.
@SpeakerRyan U sold out!! did not stop spending! gave Obama $ to continue refugee invasion and no stop to sant. cities!!
@SpeakerRyan Looked to me like the DEFENSE CONTRACTORS and BIG OIL were the winners, not the people.
@SpeakerRyan @greta Wish I could be excited as you seem to be but pardon me, there seem to be more losses than wins for Americans!God Bless!
@SpeakerRyan You should have passed what was needed and unfund all democrat BS
