The BEST thing will be a GOP rout so the government can function again: an end to the GOP.

Until you come up with some constructive ideas for solutions, you're just compounding the problem.

Having a National Insurance Healthcare program in place so everyone gets the most affordable health insurance
Hey try fixing the problems, and tell the U.S. Attorney General to seek an injunction to restore those policies
But without affordable health care insurance CEO's can rake in millions in bonus and pay huh.
