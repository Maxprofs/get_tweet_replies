All proof we need Medicare for all-give up YOUR taxpayer funded benefits, or give the taxpayers some benefits
@SenThomTillis How many people covered under #ACA ?My son has brain cancer - he's covered! We live in NC and we won't be silenced
ME! I work; I pay taxes; I employ people; I take care of myself â€” and you're taking away my ability to see a doctor. ME!
@SenThomTillis don't repeal #Obamacare without replacement. Don't #makeamericasickagain
@SenThomTillis We will fight this! #StopRepealOfACA
me, my mom & g-ma. Mom is currently battling cancer. Look me in the face when u take away our healthcare, if u have the courage.
Plenty of Americans.  Build on it and don't waste our money! AMERICA WILL REMEMBER !
@SenThomTillis you are manipulating statistics ...  won't work
If we the American people die, you folks will be poor, no one to pay for your wages for life, healthcare, triple bypass surgeries
Those of you rich men who use prostitutes, get ready to pay for divorces and pay for child support, if you remove healthcare.
#Obamacare If there are so few of us, it won't be that big a deal for you to replace? 28 million uninsured now - just wait.
GOP state legislatures are the #1 reason so many remain uninsured. & you have no replacement/improvement plan. #SaveACA
uh, if you really understand the ACA, all of us...come folks, quit chasing me away from the GOP. Use common sense
I appreciate coverage and want to #SaveACA ! Those with corporate plans don't appreciate it.
U had roughly 8 yrs to come up with something... let's hear it. Are those crickets???
I am and thankful for it.
Germ warefare is as bad as Cyber warefare it was used on the Indigenous peoples of the Americas small pox on free blankets
And since Republicans want big tax breaks for billionaires then how will the gov work? On imposed taxes of poor and middle class?
Who cooks in kitchens, cleans hotels, homes, theaters, food servers all low wage folk, rich folk come in contact with.
@SenThomTillis you need to get this out there. I see ACA as the sham it is. America needs to wake up.
and the truth is told
You fail 2 \admit that we ALWAYS pay when people have no insurance. Take apart the health insurance monopoly!
If all in mandate and Southern states had exchanges we'd be in better place. I know, I'm in the Ins. Biz. B real, not idiologue
@SenThomTillis I AM
stop taking $$$ from insurance companies!! We will fight!
BS. Talk about fake news
Me! I'm covered! Can you provide any guidance on what I should do if ACA is repealed?
The beginning of the end of the long-deserved death of the GOP. Love how your source is literally yourselves.
It is all connected Hospitals, prescriptions, healthcare!  RepealingACA will kill millions of people including seniors and vets!
Google whopping cough epidemic of the 90's early 2000's, look at polio, look at fresh eating bacteria, and resistant antibiotics.
The working poor and middle class pay a higher percent in income taxes than those at the top, so we should have a say in how...
If your servants don't get health treatment then they are likely to spread infectious diseases to the rich and famous.
Obamacare did and has helped millions of poor and working poor, now if you want your servants to be sick, then get rid of it.
what is your plan to replace Obamacare? Can I get a copy!
@SenThomTillis can you provide the sources for the numbers in your tweet?
people on welfare
Stop with the grand standing GOP senators. McCain, Rubio, and gang.
Lots of us!!!  Friends, family.  Keep the ACA!
@SenThomTillis seems you all should be more interested with investigating Trump and team!
- why am I not surprised by this. More lies by Democrats. Numbers don't lie - people do! Thanks Pres. Obama!
BIG 0 WERE COVERED
yes it's not perfect so let's fix it so it works for ALL citizens not just white elites
Hospitals have increased their fees because there are FEWER people now insured.
LOL
I'm covered and happy with it.
so what's your plan to make it better? I haven't heard 1 viable alternative. HSAs won't cut it. #ACA #healthcare
you guys really can't help yourself telling lies.
and PS  y'all have had eight years to come up with plan   stop bitching and get to work
what's your plan?how long before it is implemented?  this is what is important not how many are covered!
@SenThomTillis liar liar, pants on fire! bunch of partisan crap (source Sen GOP) to justify stripping HC Ins f/millions. Hacks!
LIES. Regulate #BigPharma. Stop blaming the #ACA Cost of insurance has always been $275 for insulin, no generic? #diabetes
@SenThomTillis this is beyond ridiculous! Pls deal w/ traitors or many done w/ GOP voting
McCain confirms he gave explosive report on Trump to FBI http://hill.cm/qRuwrxy  
you guys did nothing for the country or people the whole time you were in power. Even now you have no replacement.
We need to add a government option.
This came from the senate GOP public policy committee. Why should we trust that it is accurate @ThomTillis @SenThomTillis? #partisan
im really covered. @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump @StacyeBranche @Franklin_Graham @TheDemocrats @MIGOP @SpeakerRyan
.@SenateGOP OK so how many will lose insurance when you pull #ACA out? Your plan will only increase covered not decrease? #GOPWhatsYourPlan
Republicans, like trump, lie automatically. Republicans did this for many years. No reason to believe anything they say now.
Then keep the foundation of Obamacre and build upon it to make it better but DO NOT REPEAL. The people will revolt and will win.
What's the proposal to cover those 28 million without losing the 14+ who are currently getting coverage? Anxious to hear.
I can't afford it and I can't afford $700 via my husband's office. I FALL IN THE CRACKS, so I pay the fine.
So fix it. Please make it better. You have 2 years of unfettered control. The credit, and blame, will rest on you.
many illegal immigrants that shouldnt be. Also dont want to here we dont have money for our people when 150 bil plus go to Iran
I know people that take the annual tax hit because they can't afford insurance & don't want to mooch off the system.
what's the point? What's your replacement idea? Stop complaining offer a solution
Obamacare serves republican constituents disproportionately to democrats. You are working against the interest of your voters
Less than think there are.
Reform Medicaid. Throwing millions of people into entitlement program w/ no skin in the game is unsustainable. No accountability.
the rich and those who are on Medicaid.
repealing Obamacare will cost 350 billion dollars. Who's going to pay for that? Not the top 1% if u have your way. We will resist
It is covering and helping humans. Have some dignity. If you have a better plan that helps people show it. Don't just repeal.
The people that working people like my self pay for!
