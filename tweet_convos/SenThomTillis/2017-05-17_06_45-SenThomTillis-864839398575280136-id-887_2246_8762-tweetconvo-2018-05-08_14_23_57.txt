When you get back, think about the Americans who can't afford the awesome healthcare you got today.
And Trumpcare prices people out of the market all together. Instead of sabotaging the ACA, improve it.
Thank goodness for you that you received good health care. I hope this will make you think of those who don't have proper coverage now.
If your premiums and deductibles went up, thank Barack Obama.  On the other hand, nothing is free.
Not asking for anything for free, and since the ACA has been in place costs have gone up every year but at a slower rate than before!
Sorry,  last statement not true. Deductibles are so high, people are putting off procedures they need. My life's work.
You are right about deductables & that is awful that's why we need to fix the problem or have Universal Health Care for All!
That sounds good, but have you ever been sick while in Europe? I have. Socialized healthcare = long waits, no choices.
As opposed to the long waiting room times in the US where once you finally get in they reject people w/o insurance 4 preexisting conditions?
Not true. Pre-existing conditions are currently allowed and will be in the future. Please trust I know of what I speak.
Glad you're doing better, now start supporting our President! You do realize NC voted for him.
Stupid ignorant hill jacks voted for a traitor to the country.
Will this experience make you rethink your party's grotesque assault on American health care? Will you have some compassion or empathy?
Then fix it. Trumpcare is insurance for the 1%.  Keep drinking the kool aid.
You are either delusional or paid by a GOP PAC.
Only in your mind. Obviously a Trumpanzee plant.

I hold you and your undying support for the 2nd Amendment and the financial support of YOU by the NRA to be responsible for the latest school shooting in Florida.
I heard you died.
Glad you are better...BUT...NOW you have a preexisting condition. OH WAIT!?! Don't you have a pre-existing condition exemption clause!?!
Congress and senators should have to be on Obama care or even whatever congress is now pushing blindly through the senate. Get real guys!
@GOP l hope when you run again, you lose
so happy for you.
Retire!
Why was he taken to the hospital? I thought the GOP's position is no one dies from lack of healthcare.
Take care...rest up. 

Now that you're safe, I feel ok being petty. 

Senators have GREAT healthcare, right?
You suck, you lowlife.
And you're deplorable, Patti .
#NoCapsNoCuts  #SaveMedicaid
@Fedco_nc Wishing the best for you, Senator! We need you more than ever!
How crude.
Hey, Senator Tillis.  Glad you are well. (from David's sister-in-law)
Glad to hear you're feeling better @SenThomTillis - thinking of you as you recover from the #CapChallenge
He is recovering because he had healthcare insurance. But you & your GOP  cronies want to take it away from the rest of us.
It must be nice having gold-plated healthcare paid for by the people who's healthcare you want to take away.
Glad to hear this!!!!!
@SenatorTimScott 

Some of you people are totally ridiculous!   Jesus!   Thom glad you're ok
Glad you're feeling better.
Hope this mean you will be scheduling that town hall to discuss pre-existing conditions.
please fight for OUR pre existing conditions, like cancer and arthritis. seniors cant pay skyhigh premiums.
Get well soon senator
So happy you have a healthcare plan that takes care of you! Can you promise the same for the rest of us?
Was the ambulance ride covered by your insurance?
So glad you didn't need #CPR but so glad it was readily available if anyone did! #AED#cprparty This is why we do what we do!!
God bless you!
thank God you're ok sir
ACA only drove up the cost not the coverage morons
Glad you are better. Will continue to pray for you until you are back at work. God bless.
Mindless parroting fools Obama Obama Obama. Yeah still looking for his birth certificate? All conservatives do is insult. No solutions.
You health insurance is paid by for by taxpayers. You're welcome.
You now have a pre-existing condition. Hope that U  learned that you need to take care of all of your constituents. Not just the rich ones.
I  hope that you know that for people with pre-existing conditions, this incident would have been very scary.
Get behind our party

@SenThomTillis  Glad to hear you're on the mend
You have your nerve posting this. You voted against Obamacare but you seem to be using the benefits from it you hypocrite.
Glad you are ok when you get back to the hill PLEASE HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS GIVE TAX CUTS,SECURITY FOR USA,HEALTH CARE ETC. GET RID OF trump!
Did our health care cover you. Why should you get health care and not our vets or senior citizens.
Glad to hear you are OK.
Speedy recovery Senator.
Please consider those that aren't privileged like you
Glad you're ok.
Glad to hear you are OK.
Glad to hear that you are well @SenThomTillis  - that was a scare.

Dude you need to resign,  we hate you!
Please don't come back you have been horrible to NC!!!
Glad to hear it. Isn't health care awesome? Too bad not everyone deserves it...
Our prayers are with you #CapChallenge
God bless.
Enjoying that healthcare you want to take away from us?
Your buddies in the house voted to deny people the healthcare that just saved your life #notsayingjustsaying
So glad to hear your ok! Take care!!

#Whacky #WED
So glad you are doing well - we need you in D.C.  @susantillis

Another rino pos that puts illegals N refugees over americans.
Who was actually praying for you?
Get well soon and please country over party
There some ass holes on here
Glad to see you're doing well. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.
Legislative agenda done! The investigation will last for years! No need to come back as republicans cannot pass anything! Its over!
Glad you're doing well.
God bless you!
Glad you are doing okay!
Glad you're feeling better. I'd take my time getting back to work if I were you. Turns out a lot happens in a day in this town.
Praise God that He, in His grace, enabled you to bounce back so fast.   Truly life is in His hands, and He knows we need you on the Hill!
Glad you're doing ok; however you haven't been missed. Your party is just as incompetent w/o you. Take your time recovering "congressman."
Bless your heart hope all is well
So glad you are ok senator. For all others, ACA is in its death throes. It just doesn't work. You can choose to not believe otherwise...
But that won't change the simple fact that it's broken. Support a viable alternative that works in a free market society or move to Canada
SO HAPPY YOU HAVE GOOD INSURANCE. Why don't you ask the medical team if they can find your spine?
Glad you're doing well.
Despite differences, I wish no ill will to anyone. Glad he's ok. That said, he doesn't have to worry about health care or how to pay 4 it.
Sorry for the health issues but i hope this teaches you and your colleagues that noone is immune to disease. H.R. 676
So thankful you're ok!
Glad you're doing well Sen Tillis. Our family is praying for you & your family. Take care of yourself.
That's now a preexisting condition yo. @DaleJr @AmyEarnhardt @martinxxl @DanicaPatrick @AllWaltrip @adamwjordan @GanassiChip @Lavarbigballer
This was a wakeup call for you to reduce your stress by being an American before being a partisan politician.
Praying for your recovery. 
I hope this makes you reconsider denying healthcare to millions. Oh wait, I forgot - You guys get to opt out.
Very good to hear Senator
Kill the ACA ! IGNORE THESE LIBERALS SENATOR TILLIS . GET WELL SOON.  TELL THE PRESIDENT TO FIGHT BACK HARDER AGAINST THE DEMS&GET THEM OUT
Thank GOD you are well

Glad you are well. But now back to work perhaps with a little sympathy for those with pre-existing conditions?
Common human decency is lacking in some. I may not agree with your politics, but I wish you a full, speedy recovery! 
Must be nice to have congressional single payer health care
We may disagree on just about everything politically and policy-wise, but I'm glad to hear you're doing well, sir.
Take it slow. Nothing going on in DC anyway.
I hope it wasn't a pre existing condition
You are in our thoughts and prayers - !!!!!
 Good to hear you're doing better 
Be well Senator! God Bless!
Glad you're doing well.
That's good to hear listen to the doctors keep well
It is good to see you doing well, sir.

Don't agree with you most of the time, and will hold your feet to the fire again tomorrow, but glad to hear that you're feeling better today
Thank God! Prayers for full recovery!
So glad you're ok!
Best wishes. Glad ur ok.
#Fake #Phony Tillis! You collapsed  bc you're so afraid of getting in trouble for YOUR Russian connections. C'mon, admit it, get it over!
I disagree with you on practically everything, but I wish you a speedy recovery nonetheless.
Now get in there and support President Trump!
You should thank your government-funded healthcare!
No hurry, Thom! You're not missing much!
Thank God
@POTUS LEAKED CLASSIFIED INFO 2 RUSSIA @WhiteHouse. 
CLEAR & PRESENT DANGER
GRAFT & CORRUPTION
OBSTRUCTION & TREASON  #trumprussia
@GOP doesn't have the stamina to be in this industry. Should stay home.
Taxpayers paid how much of your health insurance ? Yet u deny them health ins and call them livin on the public dole -
Good to know.
How abt that taxpayer funded care health ,pretty good huh Millions of Americans will die  w/out health care -PACA Now
Glad you are OK!
good to hear sir.
Very glad you're okay! Hope you will work to give MORE not LESS people access to such crucial health care.
Get well soon! There's a Democrat governor in the Tar Heel State; we cannot afford to lose a single GOP Senator!
Also why is @ocdemparty retweeting a republican?
Get well soon
I'm sure having health insurance saved you a pretty penny. Why do you think you're superior to the rest of us?! @SenThomTillis
Good thing you still had ObamaCare
2. All Americans should have that. It's your job to do right by the American people.
1. It's nice not 2 have 2 worry about health care or your job. Like the rest of us, b4 ACA. Lack of stress makes it much easier to heal.
Ain't healthcare grand?
Blessings to you & best for a speedy return to work, Senator!
The fate I wish for you is the same as the fate that befalls people from whom you are trying to rip health insurance away.
Better luck next time, America. 
Glad ur ok Senator!! Good health is the most important thing we can possess..That's why we get passionate speaking up on health care!  
Yay 
Back to work against the president we elected
Good thing you have health insurance.
Get well, Sen Tillis!
