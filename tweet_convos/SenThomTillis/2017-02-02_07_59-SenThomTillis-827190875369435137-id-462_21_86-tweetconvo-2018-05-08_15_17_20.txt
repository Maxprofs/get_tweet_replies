and the #ratings of a #realityshow Hold @realDonaldTrump  #accountable
@SenThomTillis Boy am I glad we got to pray for Arnold and his ratings. Whew! Really dodged a bullet on that one!
@SenThomTillis and discuss ratings on #TheApprentice ...
And instead @POTUS discussed ratings.  A sacrilegious disgrace.  God save us.
@SenThomTillis and pray for Arnold.  I hope you're proud of your party and president. Embarrassing.
I also pray for the Apprentice and Arnold's health. Bless him always. #PresidentBannon
@SenThomTillis I support B Devos don't let a few agitators dictate what is right and just #SchoolChoice #failingeducationfix
Do you know there are atheists, a lot of them, in the US who don't believe in prayer?
@SenThomTillis Did Pres Trump's speech about TV ratings, "tough" phone calls, beheadings, & immigration reform inspire you?
Cool! I'm sure you include Islam,Judaism,Buddhism,Hinduism,Taoism,atheism,ALL faiths,etc as well as Christianity, right?
What about Voudou? Please don't forget Voudou.
@SenThomTillis So ashamed.
- will you be voting against DeVos?  OH has had enough damage due to charter schools.
@SenThomTillis 
SURE IT WAS GREAT ....
BUT YOUR PRESIDENT WANTED PRAYERS FOR @Schwarzenegger INSTEAD OF #ryanowens 
And pray for The Apprentice's ratings??
Pray NO on DeVos.  Public Education is the foundation for the future of all americans.
@SenThomTillis And mock TV show ratings. Amen.
will you be voting against giving guns to mentally disabled people? Can we personally sue u for any deaths if you vote for it
@SenThomTillis Too bad that didn't happen at this year's prayer breakfast.
@SenThomTillis pretty upsetting when #Trump used prayer as a way to insult Swartzinager. That's not what prayer is for!
#PrayForArnold
Too bad it was used as a another narcissistic political tool.  Shame on the GOP!

Do you have any integrity left?
NYT asks for "one Republican with integrity" to step up and take down Betsy DeVos http://hill.cm/Doxl4G3  
The only thing that matters to Portman is the $$$ he gets from DeVos and others.
Isn't it a shame T made a joke of it?  Are you proud of him?
Are you praying for The Apprentice's ratings as your leader commanded??
@SenThomTillis yeah here's the difference
@SenThomTillis let's all pray for those ratings, amiright? Let's see, what else does the nation need. How about a pony?
- here I thought it was a day yo discuss The Apprentice rating and who did better - Trump or Arnold.
@SenThomTillis no thanks -  shocking but us atheists will pass.
.@senrobportman .@SenThomTillis  while it could have been great, our new president made a mockery of it and is a disgrace to our nation.
I beg you to VOTE NO for DeVos. She lacks the qualifications to implement the horrible ideology that you like about her.
So that's what Trump was doing when he bragged about his Apprentice ratings??  He's making a mockery of our country.
Senator, what is your stance on DeVos? Will you cross party lines & vote no on DeVos?
He has 51,000 reasons to vote in her favor. Another sellout in Washington who forgets who he really works for
@SenThomTillis Really? I thought it was for bragging abt "Apprentice" ratings and talking tough abt phone calls.
why did The Don use it to talk about his win
separation of church and state. #constitution
@SenThomTillis Did you pray for Arnold?
please explain how your faith is guiding you to vote for devos
What about the president's speech? Did you find it an inspiring call to faith? Odd his call was about reality tv ratings, eh?
It's a shame Trump used a prayer breakfast to ramble on about himself and his reality TV show. Your party is in shambles!
https://www.gofundme.com/buy-back-rob-portman …

Look here! You're a clown. Trump over constituents will always lead to this same result.
@SenThomTillis and for Trump to make an ass of himself.  #lockhimup
And to make fun of Arnold Schwarzenegger, as so many previous pres have done?Your president is an embarrassment & a disgrace.
and shit on Arnold, cuz that's real Christian like #arnoldschwarzenegger
Too bad @POTUS botched that with belligerent call w/ Aussie PM. Embarrassing!
Contrary to GOP belief, we don't all share the same faith. I'm praying for your term to end #noreelection
I pray you vote NO for DeVos.  #noDevos
and also talk about tv ratings #portmanpaidbydevos
Sadly our President showed a total lack of respect for all that the Natl.Prayer Breakfast stands for and focused on his ego.
"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."
As a man of faith, how do you defend the travel ban, especially for children such as Fatemah?
Most of the Christian churches  say LGBTQ people are not humans :-(
For those of us harmed by Christianity, it basically feels like you're saying those of us who are not Christian do not matter
We can all practice our own religion, but having a prayer breakfast says that the Christian religion is more important :-(
I was actually harmed by Christianity when I was harassed for being LGBTQ. I left the church after that…
do you care about your non-Christian constituents?
And the most important thing to pray for our nation is increased tv ratings??? Complete chaos,come on @senrobportman stand up
But not some dumb TV show. 
Shame on you
is ignoring calls from my family in Ohio because he plans to say  yes to the highly unqualified #BetsyDeVos They say NO!
and pray for the ratings of the Apprentice!
.@senrobportman NO! More important to talk about TV ratings. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
& great opp to discuss TV ratings, how inappropriate; rude; distasteful-course he was fist bumping at nat'l cathedral last wk
America needs to repent before its too late, killing babies in their mothers wombs gay marriages  corrupt government.
....and pray for Arnold.  He (as an immigrant) surely needs it. ;)
To pray about a T.V. show? How unchristian of you!
We all love coming together for the greater good. Please watch this to see what we are fighting for.
I pray you don't support Betsy DeVos for Ed. Sec.
If you do, I will work my tail off next election to defeat you. 
Promise.
Shameful how much money Devos has contributed to your campaign, she ranks higher than your constituents. #DumpDevos
I spent all week praying you would change your mind about Sec Ed. Your no vote would answer Ohio's prayers. #DumpDevos
you voting for DeVos is completely disgusting! She's wildly unqualified. #NotoDeVos
During @senrobportman 's next campaign, when he brags about being qualified, let's remind him of his vote for an unqualified DeVos.
And don't forget "talk about yourself and brag about tv ratings".
And talk about TV ratings? The POTUS is making a fool of our country
I'd be more impressed if you showed some fortitude and leadership by voting no on DeVos - she's unqualified for the job.
or for Trump to talk about himself. Again.
thanks for the cool info, now vote NO on DeVos like your constituents are asking. But you won't cause you're bought.
And how does this inspire confidence in those of us who reject religion?
Not too late to change your mind and protect our kids from this supremely unqualified nominee. #noDevos
And to have #realdonaldjtrump embarrass us all?  He has no shame or faith.
And Trump uses it as a platform to ridicule Arnold Schwarzenegger. Too bad Arnold was born in Germany.
or for good ratings for celebrity apprentice. Haha
I hope you are not a part of this.....  NO on Sessions . No on Bannon. Protect America
Please vote NO on DeVos. We've all been praying you do the right thing and vote no.
when will you come to Ohio and listen to your constituents about DeVos? Ur no friend to Ohioans. #noDeVos #DoYourJob
did you pray for The Apprentice ratings as well? #kissPrezBannonsAss
for all the good it's done Guess your god doesn't care.  Perhaps you would grab my attention if you stood up for our children
how many have contacted your office to ask you to vote in favor of DeVos? Zero? How many have begged you to say no? 1000s?
I hope we all remember this lack of concern for the people of Ohio when it's election time. #NOdevos #NOpruitt #NOsessions

vote NO TO DeVos!
So, @senrobportman @SenThomTillis is that what it was? All I see are clips of @realDonaldTrump's profane preening. Was there more to it?
@SenThomTillis Weren't the @POTUS'S remarks about Arnold Schwarzenegger just so inspiring?!?
what I think would be great you ask? Vote NO for Devos!!! Please!
We are also protected FROM religion in US. Please actually do something, vote no to DeVos. Religion has no place in education
And for higher Apprentice ratings. Donnie needs profits.
and discuss The Apprentice ratings apparently.  How embarrassing!
separation of church and state.. Ever hear of that!!!
: Share our FAITH, not FAITHS.  Ah, I see. Glad you clarified your narrow idealogy.
and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ratings?
I pray that you'll receive the wisdom to vote No on DeVos and Sessions.
I'm praying you grow a spine and change your mind and represent your constituents and vote NO for DeVos.
keep your religion out of our government.
let us all pray that you vote No for Betsy DeVos. Protect education. This is not a party issue.
and talk about Apprentice ratings?
Vote no on devos or you will be unemployed come reelection time
and an opportunity to make insensitive remarks.
I'm #praying you answer the phone! Voting #noDevos is what this constituency's begging for, or does the GOP come before Ohio?
severely disappointed with you Mr. Portman. You won't get my vote again because you support your lobbyist Ms. Devos.
and talk about "I'll be back" you should be embarrassed to be in this party. You have the spine to support your son?????.
That #nationalprayerbreakfast was an embarrassment as there was nothing presidential about Trump's behavior!
Praying for Ohio's kids that you man up and say NO to DeVos.
would be nice if you meet your constituents at a prayer breakfast in Ohio!
glad to see your priorities are Apprentice ratings and not our children. No on DeVos
it's not too late to make the right and courageous vote of NO on #devos
Then for the good of our nation's children vote NO on the woefully unqualified Devos. Your constituents are watching.
@SenThomTillis And talk about ratings? And pretend to care about other religions.
and pray for better TV ratings...disgraceful.
Our "president's" tackless abuse of the purpose of the breakfast ought to start republicans to begin thinking of action.
Our family w/a special needs child prayed you would vote no 2 http://Devos.You  listened to GOP not constituents.COWARD
It's going to take more than just prayer to get the nation back on track. Need GOP to start pushing back against the regime.
Please reconsider voting in DeVos! America's public schools deserve a more qualified individual who will fight for everyone!
Disappointed but unsurprised about DeVos vote. Another R putting party before country and ignoring constituents.
Bull.  You sold us out, for Betsy DeVos despite the deluge of calls from your voters.
Listen to the people,  they are saying No to Betsy Devos.  Did she pay you off too?
and pray for good apprentice ratings! Way to go Rob. How about country before party?
I'm a Public Education Teacher, Shame on you for supporting someone unqualified to lead education in this country! NO2DEVOS
or some place we can pray for  a reality tv show's ratings.
or fir schwartnagger to get better ratings. This is ur guy an none of u Rs are showing honor and courage
We paray you protect Ohio schools. Please do not affirm Betsy Amway Devos
and I pray you change your mind on DeVos. Prove you care more about of children than politics.
.@senrobportman I hope you said a prayer for the education of America's children. Your vote should be a no on DeVos.
@SenThomTillis most embarrassing Prayer Breakfast since Ben Carson chose to insult Obama with his partisan views. Shameful.
#NationalPrayerBreakfast and those of us with no faith are shunned?
#NationalPrayerBreakfast Of course. Rationality will always be shunned in a nation ruled by superstition.
We're going to have to pray for America's children after your Betsy DeVos vote.
I would think for the betterment of our country it is your duty to oppose anything coming from a man and party that sold out our country.
#SeparationOfChurchAndState
Do something re DeVos! or "This will add to the blot of ineffectiveness that will be linked to his name for eternity."
lol u pray for better NBC ratings too?!?!
VOTE NO ON DEVOS
@SenThomTillis  Then why does Sen. Tillis want to "divide & conquer?"
And apparently pray for TV show ratings to improve.
Please do not vote for Betsy Devos. If you do, Ohioans will not vote for you in the next election. I guarantee it.
So you can pray about Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Devos bought your vote with a $51,000 campaign contribution...Shame on You!
where did you get this info? Would love to quote. Thanks!
@SenThomTillis and talk about TV ratings? Don't support this psychopath.
Lets all pray that you vote NO on Betsy DeVos & Jeff Sessions!
#blockdevos
Hideing behind religion or children when their jhaones are in the fire... :(
So...not an opportunity for our President to talk about the ratings of Celebrity Apprentice?  Got it!
I pray that you come to your senses. Our children and schools deserve a qualified Secretary of Education. You've failed them.
praying you vote NO to DeVos. Great things happen in public schools- come visit my Ohio classroom anytime!

I'm sure our children will thank you @GOP - if they survive this hellish administration. #resist #RESISTANCE https://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/827253348009201664 …
separation of church & state is a vital tenant of this country's foundation. #stoptrump #leavethejohnsonAmendmentalone
I pray the GOP will wake up soon and start caring about our country, its future, and ALL Americans instead of just money.
too bad YOUR president decided to use it for his own gains & to encourage destroying the foundations of our country.
And yet the president doesn't do any of those things.
And Celebrity Apprentice ratings. Don't forget those.
did you pray for the children devos will harm? #noondevos. You work for US
you are letting down ohio's kids. We pray you vote No on Devos to stand up for our kids or we will be happy to vote you out.
I pray that you wake up and stop insulting the intelligence of citizens who watched DeVos fail in her hearing
prayer is not going to help - ethical behaviour might
SENATOR, half of OH is freaking out about Betsy #DeVos. The #nationalprayerbreakfast is cool, and all, but OUR SCHOOLS, sir.
All about ratings for Trump! What is wrong with you!
also, please reconsider your support for DeVos. She is unquestionably unqualified.
too bad we were asked to pray for Arnie.
What faith?! You're about to doom our kids to #DeVos and her no Special Ed policies! #shameonyou
and if you are Donald Trump, to self-promote and throw a bunch of useless adjectives around @senrobportman
and pray for Apprentice ratings. Vote for your constituency; not your party. No on DeVos and Sessions.
another spineless party player.
many of your constituents, the people who elected you, benefit from public schooling.
Good luck getting reelected after voting 4 DeVos, the fucking sham. We will remember.
I should have voted for Ted. Say no to Betsy DeVos
Please vote no on DeVos! She is so unqualified, hates public schools, & plagiarized her answrs on Congress questionnaire!
Thank goodness there was time to bash The Apprentice, cuz that is super important right now. COUNTRY OVER PARTY
except it was abt Trump's ego Yes plz stop some of the damage Say NO #DeVos Hitler isnt a role model
I pray that you Senator will do the right thing for the people of Ohio and the country when you say no to Betsy DeVos!
@SenThomTillis And for improved ratings for the TV show Trump exec produces.
how dare you! Listen to your constituents! http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/portman-vote-devos/97393724/ …
vote #noDevos
great that you could all sit down & pray for Trump's ratings, so he can sell the show to more foreign stations.
If you vote for DeVos, I'm pretty sure this will be your last term. Ohioans are smarter than you give us credit for.
welcome to your last term!
Tell me again how Devos is fit for a job w/no experience in education? I hold a degree in ED, guess I'm more qualified!!!
Yes, it was. Too bad the president used it to talk about the ratings of a reality show.
How did you keep from busting out in laughter??? He's an idiot and you know it!!
Apparently the breakfast was just a good platform to talk about The Apprentice and ratings...
You must love having a front row seat to the utter destruction of everything we hold sacred that's happening right now.
And obviously for some a time to pitch TV shows. So sad
please vote no on DeVoss!  So many better conservative candidates available!  Ohio public schools must need your help!
and @POTUS did none of that!
you ignored Ohioans &you're now an embarrassment! How do you vote for someone who refuses to pay $5 million she owes to Ohio?
I'm feeling better now that I voted for Ted Strickland.
