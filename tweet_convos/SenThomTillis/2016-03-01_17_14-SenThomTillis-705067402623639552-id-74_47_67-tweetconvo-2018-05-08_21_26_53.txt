@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis ure gonna be shittin bricks when Dems win Senate and Obama nominates  a LIBERAL in Jan!
@Senate_GOPs Let the people decide Presidential nominee, stop the stop Trump crap!
@Senate_GOPs the Republicans unconscionable behavior by defying and disrespecting President Obama, has repercussions.
@lynnroe52 @Senate_GOPs @ivanpols1o I couldn't agree more
@SISSY31116249 @Senate_GOPs @ivanpols1o Thank you for liking my tweet about the Republicans. With their actions they'll implode. Thanks
@Senate_GOPs this position, this party of "no" has made it difficult to continue to support the party. Getting closer to going independent
@Senate_GOPs have not read how SCOTUS works. Not a popularity contest.
@Senate_GOPs in November there will be elections for the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and Congress. There might be upsets.
@Senate_GOPs Really?   After what @SenateMajLdr  has said!
@Senate_GOPs welp, you're all getting voted out
@Senate_GOPs every politician in that video should be voted out for obstruction against the American people's will.
@Senate_GOPs We already have, you nitwits. Do your damn job.
@AnnBedge @Senate_GOPs :YES, GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR #WEAREPAYINGYOUGOP  #STOPWASTINGOURMONEYGOP   #DOYOURJOBGOP
.@Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis Looks like Senate Republicans will become the minority party after this election and Hillary will appoint judge
@BackwardNC @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis 
You Dems better do some history check. Your obmination blocked a Bush nomination as a senator.
.@jmailgr1 Oh my, listening to #foxNews? The person you say Obama "blocked" now sits on #SCOTUS. #gullible much? @Senate_GOPs @SenThomTillis
@Senate_GOPs The people already decided in the person of Barack Obama who is still POTUS. #LetPOTUSdoHisJob
.@Senate_GOPs IOWs,let #GOP Senators override our #Constitution WITHOUT an AMENDMENT to do so& ignore the majority who voted FOR #Obama x 2!
@Senate_GOPs the President of the United States has a duty to nominate a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate has a duty too.
@Oliviafoxradio @Senate_GOPs Why is this even an issue? Pres. Obama should nominate NOW. Test those obstructionist jerks.
@Senate_GOPs Agree! BUT ALSO #LetThePeopleDecide who the next President will be! Stop making voters for @realDonaldTrump feel less than!
@Senate_GOPs and when you are elected, are you not elected to represent the people? And if that is so, who do you represent? #DoYourJob #lie
@Senate_GOPs The People aren't blocking the nomination. You are. The People decided who got 4 years of SC appointments in 2012. #SCOTUS
@Senate_GOPs How embarrassing that Sessions is a republican. How totally embarrassing.
@KHShan @Senate_GOPs Not only is it embarrassing but it is shameful.
@Senate_GOPs @NikoTheFarmer I agree
@Senate_GOPs #doyourjob
@Senate_GOPs The people did decide when they elected @BarackObama...twice.   Refusing to fulfill your Constitutional duties is just wrong.
@Senate_GOPs yeah but don't let them pick the next POTUS nominee am I right? #NeverTrump
@Senate_GOPs let us make the choice!!!!
@Senate_GOPs Mitch McConnell has degraded the Senate Republicans with his behavior. The Republicans have to work for respect.
@Senate_GOPs The Senate's duty is to schedule a hearing and confirm a Supreme Court Justice. This action would help with credibility.
@Senate_GOPs #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs NEVER Before in History has this happened! #GOPDestroyingUSA #GOPFakePatriots #DoYourJob or Refund your Government Check!
@Senate_GOPs :THIS MAN AND ALL THE OTHER GOP LEADERS ARE LIARS: THIS IS A #FASCISTKOCHBROSGOPCOUPBID AND THEY KNOW IT. THEY THINK WE DON'T.
@Senate_GOPs The people did decide, they elected Obama twice, so now let the People's decision stand and let their choice pick the nominee!
@Senate_GOPs they need to add to the Constitution saying you can't fill a seat in your last year as POTUS then. This hypocrisy is too much
@Senate_GOPs they did, we ejected him twice for POTUS. Do your job Senators.
@Senate_GOPs Hey, fucknuts, the people elected the current sitting President. How about that?
@Senate_GOPs why choose now to stop observing the Constitution? Doubtful you'll like HRC or @realDonaldTrump nominee either
@Senate_GOPs #DoYourJob follow the constitution! @POTUS SHALL nominate #SCOTUS ! 
Why is this hard to understand? Do you understand English?
StopTheSham @Senate_GOPs  Do your job. @newsgirl123456
@Senate_GOPs @newsgirl123456 We the people of the USA decided back in 2012 who decides on #SCOTUS  @POTUS Obama.
@Senate_GOPs it's not the people's job it's the president's job get on board or retire. I hope the 2016 election cycle with you all in a row
@Senate_GOPs cop out bullshit. The people decided three years ago that this is the man that gets to nominate someone. #DoYourJob
@Senate_GOPs You have no credibility. Or integrity. Go repeal obamacare for the 100th time. Keep throwing our money away. You're worthless
@Senate_GOPs its the current presidents job.He was elected to do his job so let him do it.The Republican party are a bunch of obstructionist
@Senate_GOPs good,  but you should also agree to support WHOEVER wins the #Republican nomination. YOU CAN'T WIN w/o #Independent #voters.
@Senate_GOPs its to bad you did not have the guts to ask the rest of the people, of course repubs will do as you tell them to
@Senate_GOPs It would be a three ring circus re: sCOTUS nomination during a heated election time.  It can wait. The seated justices R fine
@Senate_GOPs What a crock the people did decide when Obama was elected 2x
@Senate_GOPs #LetThePeopleDecide: WHY should WE allow #government to RULE us via #SCOTUS for GENERATIONS? @realDonaldTrump??
@Senate_GOPs Same thing goes for president!! Unite behind whoever is the nominee  and quit making threats!
@Senate_GOPs DOWN for #LetThePeopleDecide: SO is #SCOTUS gonna be ON THE BALLOT this November??
@Senate_GOPs Racists should not decide SC Judge Black & Hispanic &  Asians & Whites Votes Count!  The President Will Decide Soon @Potud
#KKK
@Senate_GOPs @potus will decide not Trump? You only represent Rich Whites so u retire Rich!
@Senate_GOPs Really?  You won't even let us choose our President #AlwaysTrump
@Senate_GOPs and the people should decide who the Republican nominee should be.
@Senate_GOPs We already did you jackasses! We elected President Obama to do that! It's in the constitution, duh! Do your jobs!
@Senate_GOPs how about this..let the people decide the next POTUS..hypocrites..you are losing the peoples support..get smart.
@Senate_GOPs sessions needs to be primaried #NeverTrump
@Senate_GOPs We did that in 2012-there is no point in doing it again in 2016 if it means nothing in 2012. Recalculate. #tcot
@Senate_GOPs If the last election does not matter...we may as well not even have this next one. 

Are we done with elections now? #tcot
@Senate_GOPs we want nancy grace for supreme court justice!!!
@Senate_GOPs the people made that decision when they picked Obama last I checked
@Senate_GOPs Another GOP racist gesture against their black President,still in office for 1year! Awfull,kick them out!
@Senate_GOPs and are you going to say the same thing about Presidential election? Actions speak louder than words
@Senate_GOPs The people already decided when they voted for @BarackObama in 2012. #SCOTUS #DoYourJob
