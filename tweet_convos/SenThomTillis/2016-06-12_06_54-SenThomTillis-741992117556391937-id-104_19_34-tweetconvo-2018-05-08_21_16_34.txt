was given over $2,459,881 in #BloodMoney from @NRA to continue supporting Domestic Terrorism, his heart loves money more!
how absolutely hypocritical of you!! Be the man you set out to be at the start of your career.  #policychangeforOrlando
We in Orlando don't need your prayers, we need your vote to ban assault weapons. We pray you do the right thing.
we don't want your sympathy start by voting for gun control and stop taking millions from the NRA in donations!
disappointed to see yourself and the bulk of our NC contingency stand so firmly against common sense gun control measures
.@SenThomTillis you facilitated this by voting against legislation that would stop known terrorists from buying guns
then why did you vote to allow people on the terrorist watch list to attain assault weapons? STOP putting money over lives.
cant say you feel bad when you take money from NRA. #crocodiletears
please support #guncontrol in the senate! #enough
these people don't want the prayers of people like you who create a homophobic environment laden with assault weapons
u accept Hugh $$  from NRA, your votes in NC shows what type of person u r. My votes in Nov will not be for the Rep Party.
But you helped enable this killing
The victims' families know this
Why would they want you, of all people, to pray for them?
@SenThomTillis
God granted you free will. So use that free will, get off your knees, and start doing your damn job!
Laws like #HB2 breed hate against the LGBT community. What are you doing about that?
#RepealHB2 @PatMcCroryNC @NCGOP
Don't pray, do something that will make a difference, pass sensible gun laws! Although U got $9,900 from NRA, don't deregulate silencers!
Your "heart"?  Save the BS.  Why did you take $2.5 million from the NRA?    Bought and paid for.  You a proud "patriot"?
these are the type of things that happen when people vote to allow people on the terrorist watch list to own assault rifles
u hypocritical POS. keep your prayers unless u want 2 donate the $4.4Million from #NRABloodMoney to victims #Orlando #Enough
I'm watching the filibuster, and wishing that my senators cared enough to take real action top stop gun violence.  #Enough
.@SenThomTillis maybe you should send a vote instead #EndGunViolence #Enough
I would be honored if you would listen to this perspective on the need for action.
Make a change. Your prayers are great and needed, but change in your place of power is more important.
.@SenThomTillis should pray for his own soul, because the Deity might find it hard to forgive him for taking $2M in exchange for 50 lives.
@SenThomTillis
and your hands cash the #NRA checks. @MomsDemand #Orlando
As someone does the bidding of @NRA, you're an accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Actions speak louder than prayers.
Shove it, Senator. You have blood on your hands.  There are 2.4 million reasons why we know your words are empty.
was among 54 lawmakers who voted against a bill that would have made it harder for suspected terrorists to get guns.
I Hold you personally responsible for failing to keep the offending weapon out of tis criminals hands.Your prayers mean ZERO
BS- follow the money...the other G20 dont have  regular carnage- why should we?  on to the 177th mass shooting in a few.....
You American polis pray every time this happens - doesn't seem to make a whole heap of difference.
I'd rather live in a secular country with gun control than a religious one without it.
we don't want to hear about your prayers while you take $4,418,833 from the NRA. Hypocrite.
, save your hypocrisy for those who do not know your voting records and $$$ from NRA.  Shame on you.
Liar! your heart goes out to that sweet gun lobby dole. #werewatching #followthemoney #nrapuppet
Instead of praying, why haven"t you supported laws on gun control? U accept support from Nat'l Rifle Assoc. Could be yr son!
No one wants your prayers. Actually DO SOMETHING to stop this from happening again. Stop being a dog for the NRA.
ashamed to have you represent my state. Action and results are what we need. Not praying.
Do Nothing Loser
Interesting You're  praying for the LGBTQ victims after having accepted $257,390 in 2014 from anti-LGBTQ
don't pray, use your position to stop the next mass shooting
You took 2.5 million from the NRA? You are a killer also. Keep your useless prayers to yourself.
you're praying for more $ from the NRA
Please join me in telling Thom and Susan to go fuck themselves.
oh please. You hate gay people and you take money from the people that allow a crazy person to buy a gun. You're shameful.
Meanwhile, the National Rifle Association poured roughly $2.5 million into Tillisâ€™ coffers during the 2014 election cycle.
Day after the San Bernardino,shooting Tillis voted against a bill that wouldve made it hardr 4 suspectd terrorists 2 get guns
U keep praying & taking NRA cash, and it keeps happening, U need to do Your job, we elected you to do something besides pray
but keep taking that @NRA money... How about this, pray on doing the right thing and standing up to the IDIOTS at the #NRA
You took > $2 MILLION from the NRA to keep it easy to buy military weapons. Shameful. I You need to rethink your position
"when you pray, pray in secret, rather than some obligatory tweet..." Paraphrase from Matthew's Gospel #Orlando
.@SenThomTillis stop "thinking and praying" and start doing your job to protect your citizens with common sense #guncontrol @NRA
Doesn't go out far enough to protect "them" in your state! Biggest hypocrite alive
what makes you think these prayer will work where others have failed...DO SOMETHING!!! #Orlando
meanwhile your bank account and voting record goes out to the NRA. Guess which is more powerful?
really? The give the 2mil the NRA back, or better yet donate it to the families to bury their loved ones. You're responsible
The #NRA gave @SenThomTillis $9,900 to do nothing about gun control besides pray for the ever-growing casualties.
My heart goes out to everyone affected by the horrific act of terror in Orlando. Susan & I are praying for the victims & their families.
.@SenThomTillis We aren't interested in your prayers & empty tweets. We want gun control policy & you out of the @NRA's pocket. #Orlando
Did you fight against HB2?
Save your disingenuous prayers.  Keep fighting for terrorists on the no-fly list to be able to buy guns.
u have a lot of nerve with hate spewing anti-LGBT self. The blood is on ur hands 4 lack of common sense gun control
Hopefully folks are listening to leaders of gay community. They aren't buying the national debate 
This is not about Isis
U R the most vile hypocrite I've ever seen. U take obscene amounts of $$$ from the NRA. Your party is anti-LGBT. #stopthelies
you represent us, the people. Why don't actually you do something instead #ThoughtsAndPrayers
.@SenThomTillis Your prayers mean nothing. By taking $4.4M from NRA & voting against gun control, you're complicit in the #Orlando massacre.
In 2014, the NRA spent OVER A MILLION DOLLARS for you. Quit praying and do something. #corrupt.
That is, literally, the very least you can do.
oh look - more prayers! The same ones that stopped this event will stop the future ones.
Not good enough. Do something to stop the next one.
.@SenThomTillis How about you and the rest of the obstructionist, NRA-loving Congress DO something besides "thinking and praying"
.@SenThomTillis Quit praying a do something!!!!! #Orlando
.@SenThomTillis Oh that's right you get money from the gun lobby... So you'll do nothing 
Your prayers have been so effective before, I'm sure these will help too!
The guy didn't even have to go through waiting period, and only bought long gun a few days ago, so it wasn't planned, by Isis.
GOOD+++
First thing out of Tom Brokaw's mouth..."gun control".
