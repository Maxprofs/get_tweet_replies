.@SenThomTillis thoughts and prayers are great, but not as great as the $4.5 million you took from the NRA to stop any solution, amiright?
What would have stopped a legal firearms transport from turning deadly? #Fll
thoughts and prayers?
Im watching #FLL interview. This guy seems to have had mental health issues which politicians can deal with.
.@SenThomTillis Answer your own prayers by supporting common sense gun laws!! #StopTheMadness
.@SenThomTillis "Drafting gun control regulations for the families of the victims & everyone at #FortLauderdale airport." (There, fixed it.)
Yeah so concerned, give back $4M NRA donations this might be believable
How much does NRA give you each time an innocent person is gunned down?
Bet it's pretty darn lucrative.
you don't care period ... #nra #guncontrol
$4M from the NRA? Is that true?  If so, screw your prayers.

Pray for your soul that you sold to the devil.

Stop taking blood money from the NRA then and reform gun laws to make these tragedies less likely. Or shut up.
you have blood on your hands
seriously though....4 million dollars??? Who are u loyal to the NRA or keeping the people safe? You're just another DC fraud
Your "thoughts & prayers" are worthless. You took dirty gun $$$ from the NRA. Gun violence is on you.

just checking in to see if your prayers paired with the $4 mil you've gotten from the NRA let you sleep soundly last night?
#liar #phony #bloodonhands #shoveyourgunsupyourass
Why bother? You'll vote with the NRA the next time so don't waste your thumbs. Save em' for counting your NRA donations.
thoughts and prayers don't help deaf people. You have NRA blood $ on your hands. Mentally ill people should not have guns!
- Offers of prayer may come across as a little empty coming from someone who receives millions from the NRA. Think?

if you run renegade and work w Ds to reduce NRA stranglehold on senate you could be a Hero. L & R agree. 1/3 voters are Indy!
Your words are pious hypocrisy. Worthless words from an NRA shill! You are bought and paid for by gun manufacturers!
4.4 million from NRA? Thoughts and prayers really?
prating that your check from the @NRA clears
"people ask me 'how do you sleep at night', I say, you'd be surprised how comfortable a bed you can buy with 4.4mil from NRA
nope, you don't get to say anything but "sorry."  THE BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS
your actions make shootings like this possible. Your blood money.
You keep praying for them, and the NRA leeps preying on them.
instead, why don't you do do something that will actually make a difference like stricter gun laws?  #boughtbyNRA
did you really get $4M from the NRA Senator??
Praying for responsible gun laws in America.
seems your prayers are rather worthless over the last few mass murderers. You might want to do something bigger.
4.5 MILLION DOLLARS?!?!?!  Keep your prayers & give back that money to the NRA. You are complicit.
That $4 million NRA money would help the victims and their families a lot. Why don't you put you money where your mouth is?
Admit you don't care. NRA money spends well.
You poor pathetic little man. Don't you know that guns are for men who are insecure about their manhood?
4.4 mil. from the NRA.  Shameful.  Stop being a shill for the NRA and pass common sense gun reform.
hypocrite your thoughts and prayers are meaningless.
you got over $4 million dollars from the NRA. Don't say anything next time.
the pathetic outcome to this is u r too much of a politician to address any of us or our tweets. #saysomething #respond
save your prayers and do something to help us. #passreasonablegunresteictions
Blood money! When do you admit those prayers aren't working!!?
stop accepting contributions from the @nra. #thoughtsandprayers
praying for another 4 mil from daddy @NRA? Legislate for the good of the people who elected you, not the people who own you
Thoughts about praying for more $$ from the NRA 
So, do something meaningful. Give the 4 million you took from the NRA to victims.
you might as well have pulled the trigger for excepting that NRA blood money
$4.4M buys a lot of sleep aids, I guess.
.@SenThomTillis You took $4.4 million from the NRA. Stop pretending you care.
$4,418,012 from the NRA. Perhaps YOU'RE part of the problem, @SenThomTillis.
NOTHING is more meaningless then twitter prayers from someone who took over 4 MILLION DOLLARS from the NRA !! #GodWeeps
@32Amanduh @SenThomTillis You are working on a bill to allow guns in airports as this happens.We have no need for guns anywhere
You have blood on your hands AGAIN. How much has NRA paid you? I thought you were "pro-life"???  cc @Everytown @igorvolsky
How much  did you receive from NRA?
but 4.4 million from the NRA, buddy.  Your thoughts and prayers mean shit.
FL is an open carry GUN state.  We NEED sane GUN LAWS not more convenient political tweets about prayer
Are you actually praying, or just tweeting that you are? You are the NRA's little minion. We know you don't actually care.
shame on you Senator. #thoughtsandprayers are of no help here.

Praying to the NRA god who gave you $4,418,012 to thank him for his dirty work?
We don't need your prayers. We need action. Do something about it before you take NRA Blood money
thoughts & prayers are meaningless from someone who rec'd $4M from NRA. #thoughtsandprayers
30% of Americans know someone that has died due to gun violence. Prayers are not enough
You've taken millions of dollars in NRA blood money = how many prayers?? #DoYourJob #HypocracyIsTheWorst
hey Thom, good chance to use that $4.4million in NRA money for hospital/funeral costs for victims. #thoughtsandprayers
James 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
by refusing to make change you're effectively murdering the next family. Try putting legislation in place.
Blood is on your hands, NRA pawn.
You were probably praying for the $4.4m you received from the #NRA aswell? Coward!
Blood on your hands, @nra shill
Four million plus $ from the NRA. You are a hypocrite and disgust me. How do you sleep at night?
This prayer is sponsored by the NRA... Shame on you
I wish you were pro-life enough to oppose the slaughter of innocents with guns.
do your job and stop taking blood money from NRA. #CommonSenseGunLaws
please stop selling your votes to the NRA
$4.4 million from NRA, all you can do is pray I guess. #MOMSDEMAND #HowLong

the blood of our fellow citizens is stained with your inaction to make getting guns harder you are a shame and hell awaits
Please enact actual gun control and save the crocodile tears.

But the $4,418,012 you got from @NRA makes you feel better about it right?  #Bloodmoney
over 4 million dollars from the NRA. Gimme a break senator you really don't care
$4.4mm from the @NRA buys a lot prayers, doesn't it?
You are bought and paid for by the NRA.  You have blood on your hands. You are complicit in these murders.  #FortLauderdale
but airports are gun-fee zones.
Not if guns are in the checked luggage.  Also, some states aren't gun free at the airport.
this one was
Unless he took it out of his checked luggage.  If you're allowed to have guns there, then it's not gun free
let's see how it shakes out.
#thoughtsandprayers  HYPOCRITE  How much did you get from the NRA?
I truly hope all the $$$ you've received from the NRA weighs VERY HEAVILY on your conscience, Senator.
prayers won't help. Try legislating.
