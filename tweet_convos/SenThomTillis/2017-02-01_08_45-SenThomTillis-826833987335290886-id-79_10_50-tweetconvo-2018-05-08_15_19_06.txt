Hmm @SenThomTillis. There were some typos in your picture. I fixed it.
Great job, it's perfect now! After all, #NCGOP's Motto = gerrymandering to prevent POC from having a voice.
yup. Because they can't win any other way.
You got that right! If voting was fair, we would be a Blue State! We'll get there soon.
. Don't forget up and coming Frederick Douglass.
As you voted for Jeff Sessions.  Good luck convincing AAs that you are on their side.
You know how you could really help celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth? By voting to #StopSessions who has a racist history
Then say no to Devos folks call and let him know vote is coming
High Point voicemail wasn't full yet. But remember who we're trying to appeal to
Deeds not words. You are a leader in voter suppression.
If you care about African-Americans, march with @ncnaacp #MoralMarch . And we're around all year, not just February
Our @SenThomTillis: votes for Sessions, celebrates Black History month. https://twitter.com/i/web/status/826833987335290886 …”
@SenatorBurr WE didn't forget...but your support of gerrymandering and voter suppression shows you have. #resist #MoralMarch
Please sign a petition asking for @SenThomTillis townhalls.  Pls retweet! #TheResistance
Did your aide need to remind you to reflect?! Clearly you don't agree with what this day stands for. You vote against rights
Then why did you want 2 "divide & conquer" your constituents? & what's a "Traditional" Carolinian
Please do more than reflect. Signal your commitment to equality & justice--vote 'no' to Sessions. Thanks from an NC citizen.
This would be more appropriate if your friends in Raleigh did not engage in racial gerrymandering.
Until you #StopSessions & #StopPresidentBannon you should probably not celebrate the history that these 2 men want to destroy
The most important thing you can do in honor of #BlackHistoryMonth is to OPPOSE Sessions for AG #StopSessions #SwampCabinet
 We remember who engineered unconstitutional racist voting & re-districting in #ncga. YOU, Mr Jim Crow, Esq. #ncpol #clt
will you join your fellow North Carolinians and VOTE NO on DeVos? That'd be great. Thanks.
If truly you cared about African-Americans and their heritage in our state and country, you would vote NO on #Sessions.
Tweeting this doesn't make up for you supporting the white supremacists setting up camp in the Whitehouse. #GOPhipocracy
Better picture
Please do not vote for Betsy Devos. She is not qualified.
Yes, honor the Greensboro sit in and NC civil rights pioneers.  Vote no on Sessions!
But as Speaker of the NC House @SenThomTillis, you passed a voting bill that with "surgical precision" discriminated against Black NC voters
Can you be more specific? Maybe highlight one one African-American from NC who inspires you?
PLEASE DO NOT ENDORSE DEVOS, incompetent and unqualified, protect public education for all!
Do you even read your replies?! Your constituents aren't buying for a second that you give a hoot about black history.
everyone remember his seat is up for reelection 2020.
You know how you could really help celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth? By demanding that #Bannon have less power.
as a constituent I am upset by your vote for Sessions - if you really want to celebrate Black history, don't support racists
In honor of Dr. King, may I count on you to vote NO on Betsy DeVos?  #DumpDevos
Why single out a group?  Is that not racist? #BlackHistoryMonth
The best way to celebrate African American history is to NOT vote for Jeff Sessions. I'm a constituent (28713) and I vote!
too bad you support a racist for attorney general
we the people need a voice against trump taxes Russian interference conflict of interest what is your problem
So show you constituents that you care about education #noDevos #TeamSpine
If you REALLY want to support #BlackHistoryMonth (not just Tweet feelgood memes): oppose racist #Sessions for Atty.General!
#StopSessions he will not #StandUpToTrump on behalf of the American people
You & GOP support Racist Sessions, voter suppression tactics (Gerrymandering & less early voting). Don't pretend 2 care.
encourage North Carolinians to visit the African American Museum, tells the real story!
I'm a constituent. Very disappointed in your vote for Sessions! He has not proved that he can execute justice w/o bias
if you really cared about diversity, you would stand up to #PresidentBanon. Stop with the lip service & and let's see action!
You, @realDonaldTrump & #PresidentBanon think rules don't apply to you but you will learn the hard way.
so you say, what about your position on Sessions and DeVos?
vote against Sessions.
, these are empty words and rhetoric when compared to your support of #Sessions. Courageous reflection is what we need today
and to start it off, you voted to approve #Sessions for AG. Shame on you.
Why wouldn't he?
perhaps you could reflect on Jeff Sessions' checkered history on civil rights. Please consider opposing his confirmation.
perhaps you could reflect on how gerrymandering in our state effectively disenfranchises African-American voters.
in honor of Black History month, let's get those voting restrictions lifted in our great state of North Carolina.
you reflected and then still voted for Sessions? Nope nope nope
You didn't do a lot of reflection voting for a man deemed to racist to be a Judge.
then vote NO on Sessions and commit to a NC that is equal for us all.
That confident YES for Sessions says that you are a HYPOCRITE!!
You support and confirmed a CONFIRMED RACIST...now we know how you truly feel! Your a Deplorable human being!! #election2018
so clearly, no vote for #Sessions then?
would be nice if you also stand up for justice
yet you will #RubberStamp Jefferson Beauregard Sessions - a known bigot - to the Attorney General position #OutofTouch
Can you name one meaningful thing you have done for the AA community in NC? Your vote for AG today doesn't match your tweet.
it is not possible to honor African Americans while voting for #sesions - a confirmed racist. You have let NC down.
reflect and then vote Jefferson Beauregard "Jeff" Sessions II for attorney general WOW are you doing it wrong
You voted to confirm Sessions -an enemy of the VRA and a man who jokes abt the KKK. Tell us about your reflections.
We are not with you in your vote for Sessions. Profile in Cowardice!
.@SenThomTillis Back up your words with actions to protect the rights of the Af. Amer. community. Block Sessions as AG.
so I can count on you to vote no on Sessions who has a history of discrimination then?
Spare me! You could care less!
think about this when you are deciding to confirm Sessions as AG. He has not always been nice to African-Americans.
The greatest #BlackHistoryMonth message you could send would be to #STOPSESSIONS.
You just voted for racist Jeff Sessions. What a joke you are.
Yes who are you kidding @AltBadlandsPark @altFoxNews
