@Panthers #KeepPounding don't let up I hope today's game proved that it's not over til it's over. Great game to watch an congrats on the win
@Panthers GO PANTHERS!!! The march to perfection and Santa Clara, CA, continues!
@Panthers my heart stopped waiting for the field goal
@Panthers lucky that the Giants suck
@Panthers @DGodfatherMoody and in the words of Daniel Suarez "that's amazing"
@Panthers I'm glad we won and disappointed in the performance. We cannot play like this come playoffs. Elite teams will not be so forgiving.
@Panthers I love it how cam stayed humble the whole way through. Obj is a cocky little bitch #humblenewton
@Panthers by an inch or a mile winning is winning.  Don't hate appreciate history!
@Panthers @allisunrae Stinkin' field goal!
@Panthers you are the Best. Forget the 
Resto.

@Panthers @Chrissy_NC Congrats from a Patriots fan who will always enjoy seeing THAT team take a lose.

@Panthers @ESPN_FirstTake Hope the Panthers keep their foot on the gas. '72 Dolphins...pay attention. Might be sharing undefeated seasons!
@Panthers almost choked playing the giants #Overated
.@Panthers Thank goodness for that win, could have been pretty bad if FG was not good, and #CamNewton saying embarrassing #Giants came back.
.@News_Prowler @Panthers Well now that #Panthers won, all is good after a bit of scare, but now only 2 games are left in the regular season.
@Panthers #KeepPounding

@Panthers @OdellTheGOAT Odell shouldve been booted from the game after the hit on norman he aimed up on him and pushed off on the TD catch.
@Panthers Wahoo wahoo you did it again 14-0. For all you doubters out there IN YOUR FACE.  Keep pounding Panthers!
@Panthers Way 2 go Panthers! Great win & way to overcome adversity! Lost ALL respect for OBJ today! You sir are a punk & should be suspended
