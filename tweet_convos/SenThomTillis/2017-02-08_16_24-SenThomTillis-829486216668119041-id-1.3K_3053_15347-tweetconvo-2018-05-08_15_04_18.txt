Sessions may have to just gut alot of that group. But HRC is still in play. I still have hope.
Sick of the Left!!!
Putin will take you! Wait, you're too liberal for Russia.
sorry but I love Trump. He and his cabinet are going to do some amazing things for us
You should be sorry. Electing him was a terrible decision. He doesn't care about you
what exactly has he done that makes you feel he doesn't love his country?
Hmm, not paid taxes, loves Putin, said Obama wasn't Amer., lies, isn't a Christian
Thats a good laundry list. Where is your proof?
extremely disappointed in the blatant refusal to follow NC constituent's wishes. We will elect a new voice in 2018.
He is up for re-election in 2020. 3+ years of reasons to vote against.  #washyourhandsofthom
seems we are stuck with both Thom & Burr for now. Flipping state level legislation is first step. 
We are never stuck. We will be a thorn in their side 24/7 until we can vote them out.
lol. And yet WE won
I wouldn't call it winning.
of course YOU wouldn't to you truth is lie and lie is truth.
Noe please get to work on arresting Hillary and having her trial.  The sooner the better.
He'll be too busy covering up Trump corruption &  trying to suppress the black vote, comrade
Aw honey I'm sorry you didnt learn too good in school-God couldn't bless everyone I guess
@POTUS Don't talk accountability unless you're ready to demand financial audit of Tr*mp family + investigation of Flynn!
@POTUS AG Session should prosecute to stop illegal acts. Seems #DOJ moves to slow.
Keep sanctions on Russia and IRAN.
What is your stance now that we know #Sessions committed perjury? Great choice for attorney general! Bravo
@POTUS like he's done before???!!!! Right
No, @jeffsessions will be under #russiagate investigation with the rest of the #trumpteam. #radicalright #putin #coup #resist
what abt the Accountability, transparency, all the lies from trump and GOP?
.@SenThomTillis only issue concerning @TheJusticeDept is its current AG. fact that you think him capable only shows yr lack of character
how much was the check you got to write this BS?
@realDonaldTrump Praying for you @realDonaldTrump #MadeInTheUSA
If you're supporting racism and this dictatorship, then you need to pray for yourself.
The dictator left office this past Jan 20th.
I see you support being told what to do. That must be easy-no thinking.
No, I resent being dictated to. Obamacare told you to buy insurance.  Next.
We need you to show up to a Town Hall meeting (s). Do your job and show up to hear us.
@POTUS let's just hope so...
So when can we expect the appointment of a Special Prosecutor to investigate the crimes of Lying Trump?
- the USA suddenly became a whole lot safer when President Trump was elected, and now another leap into sanity, thank God!
Report the percentage of calls, faxes, and emails from your constituents in favor & in opposition of Sessions. Let's compare.
#SHAME on you, sir, #SHAME. Sessions will put women & minority rights back 50 years. Go back to counting your DeVos money
why do people just sit and make up garbage? To say "Put women and minority rights back 50 yrs" is way unsupported!!
It's what the left does when they don't have a good argument! They lost credibility a long time ago.
This is a human issue, not political.
No, it's a political issue. The left typically see racism where it doesn't exist.
so if it's not racism what is it called when minorities are targeted?
Shameful. Your constituency overwhelmingly did NOT support this nomination. Enjoy the next 3 yrs bc you are getting voted out
Can't wait to talk to you during your town hall next week!  Oh, youre #cowardly not having one
@POTUS Apparently $70,200 buys your vote for education & regression.  You are such a disappointment to NC.
by accountability, do you mean to the rule of law or to @POTUS? BC they are no longer the same.
. @SenThomTillis he will support voter suppression & racial injustice. This constituent will be working to keep you from reelection
Sign this position demanding town hall meetings so @SenThomTillis can explain himself! #TheResistance
while you are signing the position,  the rest of us will not sign the petition.
@POTUS if you believe that you are a threat to this nation.
Is part of the rule of law telling the truth while under oath? Or is that more of an accountability thing? #sessions
Oh! Well, if you say so it must be true. Wait, forgot who I was addressing
Though you lost your credibility the second you took DeVos money. Oops. Trust is a weird thing. Hard to gain, easy to lose.
@POTUS "plaguing the DOJ" nice touch. Enjoy these moments 4 when you get voted out you sanctimonious . .
So when does Sessions plan to charge Trump & Flynn with treason?
Enjoy your brief time left in office...  And don't spend too much money, your lifetime pay is being discontinued...
Please consider signing this petition holding @SenThomTillis accountable. #TheResistance
Reminder: You work for us. We will watch you even closer & make sure you hear us next election. You will not be re-elected.
Are you willing to stake your career on that?  Oh, I guess you just did.  #SessionsWatch
@POTUS #ShameOnSheepTillis.  Hates The People
Please consider signing this petition holding @SenThomTillis accountable. #TheResistance
You sold out NC.
Please sign petition requesting town hall meetings so @SenThomTillis can explain! #TheResistance
So we're going to blame you as well as Sessions for all the wrong he intends to do.  You've now vouched for him Senator.
You are a fool.  How did you get elected?
@KimLDuluth purge Obama appointees from Justice - it was infiltrated by Muslim Brotherhood 
BS man!  Sycophantic!
Enjoy your time in office. Your constituents are disgusted with you, Yes Man.
You don't really believe a word of that crap... do you. Oil, pharma, war profiteers, banksters do all your thinking for you.
what about the accountability issues of our current administration?
@POTUS 
@POTUS racist AG!
"'Tis better to be silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt." -Abraham Lincoln
@POTUS why would we believe that when the president, Senate and Congress do not follow our laws or do what's right
Shame on you!
Will Trump follow the rule of law? He's been trashing a judge on Twitter all week.
@POTUS  @presidentbannon wondering when you'll get a backbone and stand up to the most corrupt cabinet in history.
Will he stand up to T when T is wrong?  That's the question?  Will you?
@POTUS he's a racist ... We have lost all semblence of trust in you guys
@POTUS  My husband is more than qualified to be the cyber security expert and has been vetted
@POTUS 
Please re tweet if you think congress should #ImpeachNinthCircuitJudges


Senator. Please encourage our new AG to pursue the Clinton cartel. We can't just let their crimes pass!
@POTUS MAGA
Now if you would follow Conservative values we will be ok. #NoRINOs
ya mean the grand dragon wizard of the kkk will? sure just what America needs is another hate fear mongering entitled bigot
Very bad. You didn't listen to us.
dream on, he will enforce vote suppression like he wants to
moldy cheese lookin garbage man.
so happy to know money buys your support.  How do you sleep at night?
You're hilarious.
We live in a apartheid legal system.
1% never prosecuted, while #WeThePeople turned into slaves!
is an embarrassment to NC @POTUS  is an embarrassment to the USA
Sessions proposed an amdnt to ban same-sex marriage & opposed Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act. He's not accessible to All.
And most likely destroy our civil rights while doing so
SO SAYS THE RACIST SENATOR FROM THE 3RD WORLD COUNTRY OF NC
Are you a proud racist, too?  Shame on you!
@POTUS 
Thank God.  Our country is in good hands. We the people want America back from the crazy liberals.
The Department of Justice 2017 group photo
@POTUS @SenatorSessions "Right Off, Start With Arresting ALL ILLEGAL ALIEN WITH CRIMINAL HISTORIES, JAIL TIME!"
AND will continue the fight against the right to vote!!! GO US! #Republicans RULE :)
@POTUS so you say
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan REALLY???  AND HOW WILL HE BE ACCESSIBLE WITHOUT A WORKING WH COMMENT LINE?? Republicans are out of touch
DOJ is the plague.
@POTUS   I can only hope so
And he will completely avoid all that justice for all mess that has cluttered the courts. 
@SenThomTillis @POTUS
@POTUS WRONG, just another white supremist I guess like the rest of you. I don't want to be Republican anymore
@POTUS C. King and the majority in this country think otherwise. Midterm elections are coming.....
But will he stand up to @POTUS will he uphold the law when @realDonaldTrump breaks it?
your quote in this article is truly disappointing. We are real! We call! We will be heard! https://www.buzzfeed.com/lissandravilla/senators-are-pissed-their-constituents-cant-get-through-as-p?utm_term=.fkXPYEN4O#.cpGren4NR â€¦
I'm glad you think so.  I think he has a huge blind spot when it comes to issues of race and justice.
@POTUS what do you know about the law?  Nothing I'm sure
He's a disgusting racist, and so are the people who are supporting him.
You mean plaguing the Republican Party!
@POTUS no he won't.  He's a bigot.
you are a disappointment to NC voters and you do not represent us Tillis- #midterms2018
@POTUS glad to know u stuck up for people of NC and not this "Republican mandate" that doesn't exist #votingfortheotherguy
our courts don't even follow the law
How do you know that?
@POTUS yes let's go tearing down the house as soon as you get in the door. Just like WH
@TrueAmerican13 that sounds like a great music to my ears, and I thank u immencily. spelled wrong.sorry
they send my child porn b/c he the judge wants domination.They block his school b/c its from home
last year I pulled him b/c he had a friend that believed in killing everyone on the bus. YES, I PULLED HIM.
@POTUS nice to have an old time racist on board
I'm an American citizen, I am curious where you stand regarding president Trump's ideals about making America great again?
I live in NC and I'm so disgusted by you and the Republicans. You don't speak for me or  North Carolina
Like the black man. You will lose re-election.
@POTUS in what world?
Does that mean he won't investigate you?
Saying he will be a good attorney general doesn't make it true. Guess you're into #alternativefacts & ignoring constituents
@POTUS Lived in Bama when JBS was AG& he's not going to be good for the country! A leopard can't change his spots! Racist man
shame on you for supporting DeVos and Sessions in a dismissal of your constituents' will. I will not support ur reelection

your vote does not represent me as a constituent.
Sure he will Senator...no worries we buy every word you say- no sorry actually we are not the ones that get bought ...hmm
Please be vigilant and monitor him for racist movements.  I'm sad you supported him....
you got a fire 3/4 of a regular people that were there
@POTUS one prays. But his track record is terrible
PIG
@POTUS  I voted for you when I was NC resident. You belong in the dem party. You ain't foolin nobody.
Hopefully AG Sessions will fire August E. Flentje, the Justice Dept lawyer ill-prepared and incompetent in front of the 9th C
@POTUS and discriminate as often as possible
@POTUS he will distort the law just like the rest of you corrupted people up there
So Glad country finally has AG and DOJ will follow rule of law. Treat everyone equally, including HEC! Special investigator!
yes he will address organizational issues. Get rid of every last Obama appointee.Or nothing will change! Sweep clean.
@POTUS delusional
@POTUS And do whatevet Trump wants him to do. #PresidentBannon
Wow another out of touch politician trashing DOJ........sheep, sheep , sheep
booooo. Shame on you. This is embarrassing to our nation - ALL OF IT!
@POTUS for the white folks, at least.
you're supposed to represent us not tow the party line! Will be working on getting your opponent elected!!
@POTUS Who are you kidding? Do you think people really believe your lies?
hahahshahahahaaaaaa, ahhh. (Wiping tears from my eyes) that's a good one.
What issues are plaguing ... post a link to your findings, no more statements stand alone.
@POTUS hahaha...that was funny! Try comedy
man you are complete garbage.
Sure if you're a rich, white man this should all work out great
I have confidance that Sessions won't be supplying weapons to the Cartels as an experiment...
You really think #Sessions will follow the Rule of Law
Poor baby. You should put some ice on that. @MarinaGipps @SenThomTillis
PLEASE hold him accountable.  No more towing party lines!
I will hold Thom Tillis accountable and vote against him in his next election.
Right after The CEO shows us his tax returns and divests of all business interests. I'll hold my breath. 
The DOJ took their direct orders from Obama which is why The Clintons became so rich and above the Law!
I do not know but am willing 2 bet #Sessions did not work at same Law Firm as Comey, Khan,  Lynch,  Mills. .Time to #MAGA!
Our past AG allowed Bill Clinton 2 meet with her privately while he & @HillaryClinton were under investigation, Not Sessions
@KennethHoefle  AND FOCUS ON ORGANIZED PEDOPHILIA, COMMUNIST FRONTING, HILLARY EMAILS FOUNDATION, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, BLUELM
@POTUS 
YES! FINALLY! A return to law & order in the United States of America! @POTUS made a GREAT choice in AG @SenatorSessions 
Let's hope so! http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/31/sally-yates-responded-jeff-sessions-asked-would-defy-president/ â€¦ @POTUS
@POTUS bashing the DOJ. From a President? Awful!!
@POTUS The world is watching your choices of racists, under qualified, alt right.
Shame on you Tillis. You will go down with the rest of them
Great, a racist AG - you are a disgrace to our state.  You will hear our voice!
Wow, Sessions will follow the rule of law! Good to know. That really needed pointing out.
.@SenThomTillis You have failed us all. We, your constituency, will remember your deceit.
@POTUS you are truly bought and paid for. Ignorance is bliss and you are the happiest people on earth.
@POTUS Damn, you are just a hilarious jokester, arenâ€™t you? You love suckling at the teat of Trump, apparently.
Bullshit he will!
@POTUS VOTE OUT ALL WHO SIDES WWITH TRUMP.
@POTUS Did you read that in the Republicunt book of what to say, while doing the exact opposite? You're all shit that lie.
I am Sure he will He should be Given a Chance before being Attacked Hated and Crucified
@POTUS no re election for you!
According to the rule of law, abortion is legal! Birth control is legal.
@POTUS  What  a wonderful  change!
@POTUS Way to go
there is no past proof of this, but your feelings. We need strength to stand up for our Republic and the GOP are not leaders.
@Angel_Burdett sure he will, as long as it serves his master!
But his history of racism makes him unfit for this job. I'm disappointed that you voted yes.
we saw how much money devos gave you. What did it take for sessions to buy your vote?
"so help me God" and senators hold him accountable! Time will tell.
@POTUS Time will tell won't it?
@POTUS so disappointed that sessions was confirmed.  blehhh!
Will believe it when I see it. Won't hold my breath, though.
At long last!   Hallelujah!
