WHAT COULD UNDERMINE BIPARTISANSHIP WORSE THAN HAVING VP PICK A NOMINEE FOR THE 1ST TIME EVER? PLS NO ON DEVOS
it takes a brave man to stand up for what is right. Thank you for this. Please do not back DeVos.
Show your a true bipartisan #NoonDeVos
. @SenThomTillis congress needs senators to vote with their consciences, not for the large donors.
You said it in this video, "Produce results." So I'm calling YOU out. Vote NO DeVos. You know she's unqualified!
Did u take this position when O was in the White House? Bipartisanship has got to work both ways.
remember Merrick Garland?
We so need #bipartisanship and votes FOR the environment, not for large corporations to destroy the American landscape. Help!
the best way to take a step in that direction is to vote NO on DeVos. The future of our children is at stake.
#bipartisanship would be great. Please stand up to Trump's lack of patriotism. Thank you
great, we do want work in DC. Now, listen to this: NO TO DEVOS. Kids over cash. Registered Indep from NC, your constituent
you care nothing about what's right, nothing about bipartisanship. Stop lying.
Bipartisanship requires listening before acting. We the people are speaking, listen to us!
- practice what you preach and #DumpDevos today at noon. Your constituents are watching and we've also been calling
I'm delighted you agree! opposing Betsy DeVos would be an excellent way to demonstrate this! #MakeAmericaSmartAgain

You have no clue what bipartisanship is. #DeVosvote

Prove that you really mean this by voting NO on the Devos confirmation.
You mean the bipartisanship you DIDN'T give for the last 8 years? You're a joke!
@GOP WHY NOW? The GOP never worked this way. More hypocrisy coming from the worthless party
congress needs to say #noDevos
Use your verbs. You IGNORE your constituents and you vote for the $$$$$. WE THE PEOPLE are watching and our memory is long.
your vmail box is full. Please vote no on Betsy's nom for ed sec. Don't vote yes for one until there's a qualified nominee.
We need you to listen to WE THE PEOPLE who you are supposed to be working for. Vote no to Devos she is a fool.
What Congress needs is to put country before party! We need u 2 represent us and not fall lock step w/ GOP. #CleanHouse

So much for concerns re: an "ideologically-driven, far-right agenda." We constituents will remember.pic.twitter.com/kQFqhApzee
Please vote NO to Betsy DeVos! Our kids deserve better!
As a constituent, I'm deeply disappointed in your placement of party above the educational needs of all American children.
The "federal education mandates" you referred to are called LAWS, and we want existing ones ENFORCED!pic.twitter.com/HWjuKQOUwa
Thanks for ruining our schools in NC before you fled to D.C. I don't see any compassion for the students...
then don't vote for someone because they pay $ to Republicans. Devos is not good for NC. She is completely unqualified.
I hope this includes being willing to vote AGAINST DeVos tomorrow. Left you message today.
you need to be "bi-partisian" and do the right the for NC schools! Vote NO Devos!!! Please
Congress needs #bipartisanship to produce quality public education for all. Vote NO on @BetsyDeVos
Fayetteville NC voter request #bipartisanship leadership for public education for all with a No vote on @BetsyDeVos
you know what I need? You to not vote for @BetsyDeVos she's clueless to do this job.
DeVos is disastrous choice if you care at all about public education Vote NO.https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/827333659392954368 …
This country needs a few good Republicans — one would do — to rescue it from Betsy DeVos. http://nyti.ms/2kvnsHA  pic.twitter.com/eWypcRGFTb
NO to DeVos! My child is a kindergartener in a NC public school. DeVos unqualified. Job too important to be sold to donor.
The time @SenThomTillis pretended he was undecided about Devos then voted 4 her despite all the calls #moneytalkshttp://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2017/02/02/undecided-no-longer-senator-tillis-will-support-devos-education-secretary/#sthash.lKILkBcg.BdRYOSff.dpbs …
North Carolinians from both parties are against DeVos. Show that you care about us instead of party politics.
I want to have faith in you. DeVos is not qualified for Sec of Ed. PLEASE VOTE NO ON DEVOS
My daughter is in NC public schools. Please vote NO on DeVos, for my child's sake, & all other NC kids. DeVos is unfit. @SenThomTillis
so please join your Democratic and Republican colleagues for bipartisan vote against DeVos! She is unqualified! #noDevos
let's start with a probe into the #russian #election #hack #TheResistance
Follow the money! Vote NO for Betsy DEVOS! Do your job.. listen to the parents and educators.https://www.opensecrets.org/trump/appointee-giving …
Put your words into action and please vote NO to DeVos. We need qualified leadership, not more pay for play.
@NoLabelsOrg This is great! Just make sure that you're just as bipartisan with those others as you want them to be with you.
Vote no on Devis @SenThomTillis
Appalling! What a hypocrite. NC’s Tillis says DeVos will improve charters and school choice http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article130414169.html …
. @SenThomTillis I agree! I hope you will think independently about #DeVos. She is unqualified and extreme.
Are you willing to hear concerns of 50% of yr constituents & the opposition party, or do you mean just for us to accept all?
Agree. And again, I'm hoping you will start by voting NO on Betsy DeVos.
It's disturbing that your many offices are impossible to reach
Where was the bipartisanship for Garland Merrick?!? I'm from NC & we're watching.
No on DeVos and Sessions. I am a constituent of your state. Each vote counts for your seat.
like the bipartisan efforts we saw during Obama's term? Holding open the SCOTUS seat???
http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article130414169.html … COWARD! So much for listening to your constituents, teachers, parents!!! #onetermtillis
So disappointing. I suppose we'll have to *wash our hands* of this one, too. #noDevos #DemsinNCmattertoo
We aren't going away! Will be calling daily! If we have to live with this crap so does he!
Agreed! Tillis will certainly hear our voices. He won't get our votes, though. :)
talk is cheap. Its time you stand on your own two feet and vote your conscience.
you can start by voting No for Betsy Devos and other unqualified nominees.
haha what a hypocrite. Speak about bipartisanship as you blindly rubber stamp every cabinet nominee no matter how unqualified
You are absolutely right, @SenThomTillis! You should show your bipartisanship by voting No on Betsy DeVos'.
please vote No for education secretary. I live in Raleigh. She is unqualified
Yes @SenThomTillis. America needs Senate! Work with @SenateDems to stop DeVos, @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain to nullify EO travel ban.
Thank you. To start, please do NOT approve DeVos or Pruitt. -Julie Williams, Transylvania Co, NC
if you wanna be bipartisan, start representing all of your constituents, not just the ones that agree with your opinion.
Of course, Tillis didn't think this was a good idea when Obama was in the WH. No hypocrisy, naturally.
Vote no on DeVos!!
Tillis talks about bipartisanship but votes along party lines on the unqualified Devos. Listen to your constituents!
ok work across the isle help get rid of you know who
I sure hope this means you won't vote for DeVos. Don't just talk tough...vote tough! We are depending on you! #noDevos
Yes we do need #bipartisanship. Stand with US against bad appointments. Vote no to DeVos.
We need u to put aside party loyalty and do what's right for American public schools & vote NO for DeVos.
If you want bipartisanship vote no on #DeVos both Republicans and Democrats alike feel she is unqualified for the job
No on Devos. Please!!!!
Interesting how you now call for “bipartisanship” when YOU need something. Wasn’t the same case last year was it Senator?
CLNC military rely on public schools. Please Vote No on DeVos.
parents and students also need to be held accountable for their actions.
Then you need to produce results and vote NO for DeVos!! She is not a qualified nominee. Our children in NC deserve better!
This military family would like you to Vote No on Devos. She may be a good person but not right for the job!
our education system first needs political folks to listen to teachers, they kniw what,s broken and how to fix it.
where were you and your bipartisanship for the past 8 years????
NC school need help, not DeVos
I think a great way to stand up for bipartisanship would be to vote no on DeVos--she is not in any way qualified to lead DEd.
bipartisanship you say, yet you only Vote along party lines.
We are just as interested in bipartisanship as your party was under Obama. We will provide the same level of obstruction.
You have some good ideas but you really need to VOTE NO on DeVos. Nightmare.
so vote no on DeVos - she's unqualified!
You're right. Vote NO on Betsy DeVos. Show good faith in bipartisanship.
How about start by voting down the unqualified candidate in DeVos?
Stand up for public education in America. Vote NO on DeVos. She is NOT qualified OR experienced.
yes it does! So please vote no on DeVos. Help protect all children's right to public education. Signed a former NC resident!
please vote NO on DeVos. My family goes back 4 generations in Asheville. Country over party!
PLEASE hear the voices of moms&teachers across the country. Vote NO to keep DeVos away from our children. Save public schools
A good faith start would be to support M. Garland for the Supreme Court. You know it's the right thing to do.
At a time when bipartisanship has fallen out of favor, I am heartened by @SenThomTillis' comments to defend it. Thanks! #CJReform
Bipartisanship to him means just do whatever GOP says. Ignore the greater # of voters who cast ballot for HRC.
We are all Americans. Bipartisanship is the only way to get us out of this train wreck.
I am a real person from NC and would like you to vote no to DeVous
Vote with your constituents not on party lines #noondevos
not with the current POTUS. Get him out and we'll think about it.
please live up to this and join your moderate colleagues to vote NO on DeVos.
So if the other party fully does not support Devos how can you make statements like this by yes?https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/827230160520884224 …
Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she doesn't have the confidence she needs to provide support to Betsy DeVos: http://on.msnbc.com/2kuG5vt  pic.twitter.com/vfTMvWFMts
yet you're a #RubberStamp for @BetsyDeVos Sessions, Mnuchin, Price and have no curiosity about @realDonaldTrump & USSR
bipartisanship can begin by voting NO for DeVos!
Bipartisanship's great. Start by voting no on DeVos, Pruitt, Price & Sessions. Represent me, your constituent. #NoRubberStamp
I've been trying to call for days. Please represent us and do whats best for NC. NO ON DeVos!!
Spoke to a nice lady yesterday @SenThomTillis Charlotte office. My neighbor says all lines are jammed today. All offices.
As a your constituant I say START working with Dems. Stop trying to get your extreme Rt agenda through or we'll throw U out.
NC residents call any number and say #noDevospic.twitter.com/7VAmdJlpvt
if you want to be a bipartisan hero, vote no on unqualified DeVos and racist Sessions.

because thats what happened in obamas administration the voters did not vote for bipartisanship
VOTE NO TO DEVOS
Agreed! Lead by example- vote no on #Devos and demand the president's #TaxReturns. Corruption is a #bipartisan issue.
You know what else we need? A qualified secretary of education. Do the right thing and vote #nobetsydevos!
Do you not understand why Trump won you RINO DOPE? It wasn't because we want to reach out to USA hating dUmocraP radicals.
Total agreement. NC supports Betsy Devos!
how about you start by listening to both your dem and republican constituents and vote NO to Devos?
If you genuinely believe in bipartisanship, vote no on DeVos for the sake of our nation's students.
You can lead by example. Vote NO on DeVos!
Then STOP CHANGING THE RULEBOOK!! Stop ramming these unfit appointees thru committee!!
@SuitUpILM @equalitync @ncjustice yes & remember U represent all Americans, not just Christians, heterosexuals & your donors
Are you SERIOUSLY asking for bipartisanship? When the hell have YOU ever been bipartisan? You're a joke. Please retire!
Great. Get the unhinged man in the White House and we'll reach across the aisle. Hurry while there is still a republic.
as a concerned resident of NC, PLEASE vote NO on DeVos. She'll ruin our fragile education system
