I am an NC voter and I want to know where you stand on the Comey firing.  I & my 6 member voting family await your response!
My question, Senator: Are you looking for some GOP peon to call off the Russian investigation?  You might want to check with Mitch!
I got bad news for you sir. THE PEOPLE are rallied and prepareing to VOTE YOU OUT IN 2018. YOUVE BETRAYED THE PEOPLE FOR THE LAST TIME!
You need to get a backbone and demand a independent investigation and prosecutor. Why don't u care about #TrumpRussia     Obstruction I see
No sitting on the sidelines waiting for the Comey/Trump /Flynn/Russia issue to pass. Are you an American patriot or not? Independent invest.
I live in NC.  I demand that you return to D.C. and investigate Trump-Russia now.  Stop dragging your feet.
Text resist to 50409 & they will fax a letter stating this 4u. Letters & calls are more effective #resist #RESISTANCE #trump #TrumpIsNixon
please host an in person town hall meeting
We're all dealing with traffic on the chewed up NC roads at that time, Senator.  I'm a constituent.  #endTrumpsTreason
Stop hiding, hold face to face town halls.
Are we a country of laws or a banana republic? Your answer on whether to appoint a #SpecialCounsel will tell us.
Looking forward to your call for a special prosecutor in the investigation of the administration's ties to Russian meddling in our elections
NOT a Town Hall.
@SenThomTillis I am a constituent insisting you support the appt of a Special Prosecutor to find the truth about Trump and Russia.
Punked out I see. As an American and North Carolinian I'm a little embarrassed.
I think it's safe to say most of us would prefer an in-person town hall, but I'll be there.
We're your constituents, for chrissake. Do us the courtesy of meeting us in person, not in a venue you can disconnect if Q&A gets tough.
What if we don't have Facebook??? Do a face to face #TownHall senator!!!
As an NC resident: you should take a stance that benefits people, not one that strips away #healthcare. Please stand against #Trumpcare.
I am a constituent.  I respectfully ask for your support in the appointment of an independent prosector.  Hold an in person town hall!
Ridiculous you scheduled for 5:15 pm, during evening commute. We haven't had an in-person Town Hall from you. Face your constituents!!
NC coward senator Thom Tillis is having a "town hall" in his underwear in the safe space of home. Liberals questions wanted
Senator, will you stand up for American people and our democracy by demanding a Special Prosecutor? If not you should resign immediately!
What did ur unflinching loyalty 2 Trump get us. Do u not care about your NC folks affected by Hurricane Matthew?

Democracy dies b4 his eyes,

Justice has no place in his heart,…
Will you be responding to requests for a special counsel on #TrumpRussia? (Also, I hope the answer is, "Yes, we're going to do that.")
How about a town hall meeting? What is your position on the Trump2 health plan? What parts of it do you disagree with? I don't do Facebook.
Your constituents deserve a face to face town hall. What is your position on #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #SpecialProsecutor #Trumpcare ?
Good, this NC voter wants to talk about a #SpecialProsecutor & an #IndependentInvestigation into #Trumprussia
Why have you had no comment on Comey?! The Senate needs to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate Russia/Trump ties!
Not the time to be a shrinking violet. We need you to stand up and demand a #SpecialProsecutorNow. Choose #CountryOverParty or step down.
This firing of Comey is to stop investigation of Trump, the way it was handled, the disrespect, was appauling. Time for special prosecutor
How about a REAL, FACE-TO-FACE town hall meeting Senator? These telephone conference calls and FB questions don’t cut it.
Respectfully requesting an independent investigation #Trumprussia
How about you put country first and demand action against Trump
My question is when are you going to hold actual town hall meetings so you don't get to choose your questions ahead of time?
Please call for a #SpecialProsecutorNow
My only question is what is your stand on need for independent investigation of trump-russia tie.  YOU MUST ADDRESS THIS WITH US.
We need to know you support an independent investigation of Trump-russia connection BEFORE Trump names Comey's replacement.
Timing of firing for Comey doesn't only look bad for @realDonaldTrump . It looks bad for anyone who doesn't call for #independentProsecutor
How about REALLY meeting with your constituents in a town hall setting? Dare you.
Independent prosecutor needed NOW. Clear this up. Don't be on wrong side of history.
Where and when might us NC voters find you in an actual town hall Sen?
Will you stand up, call for an independent investigation into the Russia situation now that Comey has been fired? I'm NC concerned citizen.
Restore public trust -support a special prosecutor for Russia. Country over party.
Support an independent investigation into Trump/Russia and you'll probably have happier constituents.
Patriotism must trump partisanship!  Stop senate business as usual. Demand special independent prosecutor. Please stand up for truth.
Support the appointment of a special prosecutor !!!
If you don't support an #IndependentInvestigation, you're putting party over country and will be on the wrong side of history. #trumprussia
Special prosecutor now!
My Q: Why haven't we heard GOP calling for an independent prosecutor to look into #TrumpRussia ?
I'm also a constituent who would like to know if you support an independent investigation into #TrumpRussa.
Oh, and also if you plan on supporting a health bills that drop protections for people w/preexisting conditions or that allow lifetime caps.
the only question we have is when will you honor your oath of office and support a #SpecialProsecutor into #TrumpRussiaCollusion ? #COMEY
Sir~ We need an independent special prosecutor now!
Will you call for an investigation of Trump's Russian ties?
Be a man and face your constituents.
My hope is that you'll appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Orange 45 corruption allegations. Thank you
Do you support a special prosecutor for the russia investigation?
support a special prosecutor #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
It is time for a Special Prosecutor. #TrumpRussia
coward
Are you going to do anything about Comey firing and Russian ties with Trump?
.@SenThomTillis, Do you support a special prosecutor for the Russia investigation?
Here is my question now: Do you support a special prosecutor for the Russia investigation?
Why not a town hall meeting? This is rush hour!!! Working people are trying to get home from work!!!
Senator, we demand a special prosecutor.
We need a special prosecutor.  Please speak up! At least Senator Burr spoke up.
Man Up on this one--for once.  From a constituent
Still afraid of facing your constituents?
#uselessIdiot

Senator, as an NC resident, I'd like to know your thoughts on the Comey firing. Do you support appointing an independent prosecutor?
Special prosecutor. Country over party.
What time zone?
He's a senator from NC, so I would assume Eastern.
Senator, An independent special prosecutor must be appointed and not by Mr Trump.
Cool - you’ll be wrapping up right when most of us get home from work… Thanks for nothing.
Sen. Tillis, your colleague @SenatorBurr has released a statement on Comey's firing; will you do the same?
Well at least you are giving a bit more notice. Now 48 hours. Good for you, but we really want an in-person town hall.
Senator, What about a town hall meeting? Come and see your constituents.
By live do you mean taking questions from the comments, or do you mean reciting a script of prepared Q&As. Why no townhalls??
@SenThomTillis - we want an #independentProsecutor to conduct the #TrumpRussiaInvestigation immediately. #theResistance #yourConstituent
Special Prosecutor NOW on Russia collusion!
I don't have facebook. How about an actual town hall where you have to answer to your constituents.  Stop being a coward. #townhall
Real life, in person Town Hall, now. #TrumpRussiaInvestigation, #taxes, #trumpcare, and #answers!
5:15. Rush hour. Many people driving home. AND Facebook, not live and in person?   COWARD
I live in NC and would like to know when you plan to support appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate #trumprussia
What is your stance on the Comey firing. Please state your position publicly and soon.
As a constituent, I ask you to insist on an independent special prosecutor.
America needs your patriotism now more than ever.  It is imperative that you restore faith in our government.  #independentinvestigation
Senator Tillis, your constituents want a face to face meeting. You work for North Carolina, do us the courtesy of faces us in a town hall.
For starters, you could explain your support for an independent #TrumpRussia investigation
