I support a provision whereby men can only get viagra if they are married and have permission from their wives.
@AuntSnoozie @PPact @PGourevitch @EmmyA2 Needs a Permission Slip & Physicans can Lie to them on an "As needed basis" right, Texas?
No humor? Must be a BOT!
Men pay the majority of tax but aren't supposed to have a say.
Then Treat women as Equals and they pay just as much as you!
Are services from Planned Parenthood are gov (taxpayer) funded?
Planned parenthood offers abortion as the only type of "maternity care"
You're a troll
Truth hurts
Don't cry. Ogres live happily ever after, I'm sure trolls can too.
Triggered aren't we? So you resort to name calling typical!
Until the Tender Years Doctrine, men were the considered the primary caretakers of children by the government.
you don't need fed money& admitted on tape-go sell more dead baby parts-we are not paying for this genocide of #BLACK BABIES- #EUGENICS
@joncoopertweets @EmmyA2 GOP apparently don't know where babies come from. They are a disgrace as is their contempt for WOMEN.
I'm guessing this was taken when they asked the ladies to fetch them coffee and beer nuts.
Ja
This is disgusting! Men should NOT make choices about Womens bodies. Only Females choice. #Feminism #FemalePower #Matriarchy #Gynarchy
And you shouldn't force men or other taxpayers to pay for abortions.
Saying nonsense like this is what makes Liberals a joke and why they have lost over 900 state and federal position over the last 8 years!
When America gave power to the GOP Senate and Trump, they elected a White nationalist government.
*white men
You think is a group of men. It could just as easily be the Taliban based on their ideology.
@EveNoelleStone @EmmyA2 I can't see the picture but my guess wld be it's all men is that right
Indeed! All men, all white, all look to be older....
That's just so wrong ppl are sick of being pushed around just bc it not rich doesn't mean ur not important
So true....

says it all!
Yes they left ALL the PP murderers out of the room
How it should be
I don't know, maybe throw someone in there that actually has a uterus?
Using "man" very loosely with most of them.
All men? Or a bunch of Dicks? @PPact @EmmyA2
-If you support Planned Parenthood then support it yourself Chuck Schumer..Not everyone believes in abortions.
Here's the picture of the leader negotiating away birth control, maternity care & abortion. Notice anything? #ProtectOurCare
Yes. These men care more about the unborn than some women & The maternal instinct to protect her baby isn't in all women.
Actually, I hadn't. I don't judge people based on their gender.
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 please filibuster SCOTUS nom- we will support you! #indivisible
Why are progressive democrats compulsive liars
all "men...dont want to pay for consequences of male pleasure/price of s*x~baby=20yrs childsupport"
There is NO maternity care in planned parenthood stop lying to Americans.
A room full of absolute cowards!
From the org. who exterminated 7.69 million men women since 1970. Judge jury Executioner.#Abortion. @mike_pence
Does Planned Parent do anything else than do abortions?
@denisesaturn @EmmyA2 I had to put my sunglasses on first 
PP All lies, shame on you for what you do!!
Women have dropped the ball on this one!! the one place where our babies should be safe, is a sentence.The womb!
@majr_shananigns @EmmyA2 and white and rich. Don't forget that.
I feel like there's going to be a heated response to this. From the guy far right, saying " 'PROBABLY'? OF COURSE I'm a man!"
the type of people that would have an abortion would raise that same type person. I'm for your murders.
getting pregnant doesn't happen by accident. Why do people try so hard to kill something that they tried to create.
I applaud everyone here for caring for women's rights. Who's looking out for the babies lives?
why do you liars say that something is being taken away? Nothing is. You just pay for stuff on your own, like adults do.
The face or men trying to save children, or as you like to call it product, from butchers like you. They are heros.
I support PP, but abortion is murder
Disgraceful and downright scary.
If you can't do the time don't do the crime screw you make kids. I'm not paying for your sexual exploits No birth control & no abortions
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 no taxpayer abortion funds
That is really insane. I couldn't go to that meeting and then look at my daughters when it was over. #nofearwomenaresmartgood
1800's
You just may have to pay for YOUR birthcontrol, abortions or prenatal care. You should anyway.  Why should taxpayers?
@cberrl @EmmyA2 They all like to put their hands in a woman's uterus
Sen. Pat Roberts 'mammogram' line indicative of this attitude. Apology not accepted Senator until actions reflect apology.
Fight is not over.
are any of them secretly gay?
i would never do this if I ever have a child
Oh please.Grow up.
We need people with brains doing the thinking you know.
can't zoom in enough but is that FDR in the painting on the left? Watching over this debacle
@damonbethea1 @EmmyA2  Feminine men- Like they know anything what a lady goes through. Maybe they want to be women.
That's best they can do, get a bunch of men to decide about women's matters? Really backward!
@Andy Yes because men have no rights when a woman is pregnant, it's "her" body! No one EVER talks about that do they? #ittakes2
This might be funny if it weren't so appalingly sad @PPact
@arquitetinha @EmmyA2 all men
Pro #abortion group that is ILLEGALLY funded by govt want Govt control over healthcare but then they don't...which is it?
Sorry excuse for a man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man .
i noticed. Until they grow a uterus they won't understand women's health.thank you mr. Schumer for your support.
@YoungMasterPaul @EmmyA2 all male
I've always said I don't need some fat, old, white man in Washington telling me what I can do w/ my body!
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 PP, you're a bunch of lying killers
The American "Taliban".
Women are under attach by white Republican men! We need to do something about it.
@joe_kidder2 @EmmyA2 who the hell are they? Hyprocrites. Go to church and act like Jesus. Not!
and all white? May as well say clan, clan, clan,
wow I see the problem now! #RESIST
GGRRRRRRR no words left for these assholes (except maybe assholes)
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 Abortions r still available-just pay for them urself-$ the same as an iPhone so everyone can afford on their own
yep, I noticed they're all losers!
#Resist
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 too bad we can't abort PP. you disgusting vile people have a special place in hell awaiting your arrival
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2   If pic snapped sooner, they were removing white hoods.
1 guy isn't wearing a jacket
Shall we introduce legislation for MANdatory vasectomies if you have a child out of wedlock or are behind on child support?
Maybe if you ran some women that people would actually vote for you wouldn't have to worry about that.
Lol I dont understand why women have to hate men for just doing their job.
Women will always keep on keeping on. Men literally cannot exist without them.
@SenSchumer @GOP @seanhannity @nrlc Any organization selling aborted human baby parts for profit should be closed down permanently!
I noticed you profit off of fetuses 
Yes, men, too, know abortion is reprehensible &they can do something about it. #DefundPP #SoGladHillaryIsNotThere
White angry male power of hate against women whom birthed each disgusting man in this picture @VP@POTUS
White angry male hate generation after generation 240 years as if they borne own self disregarding their Mother completely
You give them too much cred by calling them "men". Weasels is more like it.

@Andy @EmmyA2 I'm not against PP but don't use my tax $ for abortion!
Man O Man O Man!
@tonic516 @EmmyA2 
Bet there were long lines in the john. Republican men do their best work there.
THIS pathetic piece of propaganda. Women's "HEALTH"?! 

#abortion #women #entitlement  https://twitter.com/ppact/status/844999238958436353 … @PPact @SenSchumer @EmmyA2
Here's the picture of the leaders negotiating away birth control, maternity care & abortion. Notice anything? #ProtectOurCare…
@4evrstardancer @EmmyA2 Some would call that a "Sausage Fest".
What a bunch of tight asses!  I won't let them decide what's for dinner let alone my daughters health choices.
You LIE!!  #Abortion is not being negotiated away. It's our TAX $ given to #women for THEIR CHOICE! They can PAY for it! @SenSchumer
I wish this were surprising, but of course, these guys don't need any pesky women around while they decide important stuff.
thanks for never providing me with a mammogram. 26 year old who was told not to worry only to have breast cancer
@VP Why are a room full of old white males setting themselves up as experts and making decisions on MY healthcare?
@VP Pence-a repulsive, clueless, shameful excuse for a leader & role model for blatant discrimination vs women
@MikePenceVP what would all these men know about womens healthcare needs???????
you can add "white" to man @MaliciaRogue @EmmyA2
Good.
@RageAganstSystm @EmmyA2 

Have yet to hear #MedicareForAll or #SinglePayer from #PlannedParenthood...
How dare you presume the genders of the people in question. Extremely transphobic.
@Varidienne it s called ignorance of insurance
Seems to me that women don't count!
Not good when men are making WOMEN'S decisions for them!
Irony is, they may be best shot at defeating ACA repeal, because they think AHCA doesn't gut it enough. Very strange times. 
@Andy @EmmyA2 no women at the
table but they were at the polls #whathaveidone
Men who get free Viagra.
that is old white rich man
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 we're women elected? Why didn't they get involved?
@peoplefor @EmmyA2 They grew vaginas.   Never had any balls
could you change all those labels to, "white republican men"?  thanks
@agape_tov @EmmyA2 You forgot the word WHITE.
@VP You had a meeting of the so-called "freedom caucus" to discuss women's health care. No women were there. Yeah, "freedom."
Yes. No women in Congress have chosen to join the Freedom Caucus. Speaks volumes. They like Big Guv=Sugar Daddy.
Nobody says women can't have abortions. We the People are just sick and tired of paying for them. #HydeAmendment
Cool!
OLD America!!!! Bring on new representation of the REAL America.
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 there r better places to go that offer more services
men are leaders !
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 they don't do maternal care or prenatal care
Where's @IvankaTrump? She's usually included in these meetings, oh yeah she's skiing in Aspen
Freedom from truth and compassion for our fellow human beings.
@HaydnGameDesign @EmmyA2 men or woman are capable of coice,no baby,no sex.or condom,etc.i dont have CHOICE to murder adults nuisances
disgraceful
Womb is a woman's organ, a baby inside womb is NOT! Shame on you , PP!
Bunch of old grandpa that`s doesn`t care about their grandchild
@Andy you are so disingenuous.  Every woman will still be bake to her bc,  maternity care & sadly abortion.  Quit the scare tactics
No, u mean a bunch of non-thinking, non-caring men r n that picture. And all of them r haters of life itself.
No, u mean a bunch of non-thinking, non-caring men r n that picture. And of them r haters of life itself.
mind boggling that women voted for them. 45 told you what he thinks about women.
what's his problem?
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 You should name everyone in this pic and what state they represent.
White rich men trying to hold onto power.
Another Dot White Production.  Disgusting GOP, the almost uterus-free segment of democracy.
and if they DO eliminate funding for abortions, sounds like a WIN to me....sick n tired of Abortions of "Convenience".
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 so says the purveyor of killing of children & dismembering their bodies for profit
and yet women expect men to pay for their health care, but bemoan lack of representation.
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 THIS IS CRAP.  MAMAGRAMS MUCH?
@Andy @EmmyA2 and your evil too for klling 3-9 month pregnancy and take out text money to do evil shit!
@Andy @EmmyA2 you planned Parenthood did shit when my cousin needed some pills like about 10 years ago so your not good for everyone!
The real joke is going to be when the dem.pary implodes
hahah, congress has cunt that could pro  test to have the US of a intevere in the Dead Csea??? chit???
Dems are old dudes and witches.
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for murdering innocent unborn children. End of story. #BanPPMurders
So what!
Morality is not a male/female issue.  Murder of innocent human beings is morally reprehensible.  Quit funding PP.
Was  the ONLY woman present (Professional Liar @KeIIyannePoIIs) "negotiating", too, or just taking photos?
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 no women?  Just the viagra gang?
#RichWhiteGuysCoup
- I am expecting a panel of all women to vote on men's health issues to keep it fair, right?
PP should get NO taxpayer money. Easy fix 4 everyone. PP makes abortion side of business completely separate company to keep funds separate.
@Andy @EmmyA2 The only moment men in charge is hated is when they are NOT like minded. #daywithoutawoman was led by MEN, but no prob!
Yes, let's take their Viagra coverage away and show them for the limp dicks they really are.
@ahamiltonkin Fr: @justinshanes Meanwhile, at today's meeting on feline healthcare...
ok this is so accurate 
@Andy @EmmyA2 Yeah they forgot their pointy white hats Andy
@Andy @EmmyA2 Yeah all men. What a disgrace. This plan sucks.
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2 abortion is not care. You are making money off baby parts. Murderers
@samriegel @EmmyA2 ?? Is this the equivlant of chicks trying to trap dudes in relationships w babies but reverse?
white white white white white white white white white white white white white white white white white
MEN were the ones who granted Roe v. Wade. You didn't have a problem with that! Abortion is infanticide.
take away their viagra
- could not be more telling, that photo.
100-some days in office and we've already regressed about 50 years.
@Andy @EmmyA2 you're right and not 1 of them has a right whether they would want a mother to kill their children or raise them
nah, they are not "man" by any standards
without these things women like me just won't start families. Then the population will fall and suddenly no new tax payers or voters
oh my, that tickled me PINK.
@monicabeau @EmmyA2 interesting
@PennyRed @EmmyA2 Yeah, they all seem to be saying "man" at the same time.
Seriously thought it said "Freedom Caucasian" and if it did, it would also be correct, right?
@MikePenceVP You Men are despicable & deplorable, to think you have moral authority over womens' lives. SHAME ON YOU!
@SenSchumer @EmmyA2
