@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper It's nice to see SOME D's actually have a survival instinct
@SenatorShaheen @kasie @Tark31 @JoeBiden @BKcolin #OBAMA ~>
@SenatorShaheen @kasie @Tark31 @JoeBiden @BKcolin #OBAMA ~~>
FYI @SenatorShaheen @kasie @Tark31 @JoeBiden @BKcolin #OBAMA has a STRATEGY ~>
@SenatorShaheen so Obama releasing the Caliph of ISIS from Gitmo didn't contribute to "manageable" solutions?
@Tark31 bit harsh
@SenatorShaheen You know ISIL includes Israel as territory...  so ISIS really is a better choice of 'pretend' enemies
@SenatorShaheen Maybe you should have said something when 
Obama starting arming them in Syria 3 years ago.
@SenatorShaheen @marcianhgirl and at that point they will be manageable
@SenatorShaheen You seem to forget BHO handled Benghazi by falsely claiming that his condemnation of ACTS OF TERROR was calling BZ terrorist
@SenatorShaheen I agree 100%, but will you be singing the same tune after November?
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper Know what makes terrorists "manageable"? Coffins.
.@SenatorShaheen nice try, Senator. You campaigned for Granite State to make "manageable" guy Cmdr-in-chief. Will you apologize for that??
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper I can't wait till the movie is made about this current situation. Directed by the Wayans Brothers...
@SenatorShaheen  Hypocrite Senator .Go back in time "your voice on Capital Hill"  and your weak voice on Iran and Syria .Pinocchio nose 4
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper Why do you and this administration insist on calling ISIS "ISIL"?  Very interesting.
RT @SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell" #IslamicState
@SenatorShaheen I'm calling bull s##t on that...@TheDemocrats never have the stomach to follow thru in conquering evil...
@SenatorShaheen BHO merely giving himself an out on his "destroy" statement What has BHO done to earn your trust on anything to do with Mil?
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper what do you propose replacing social movement, civil war group, with, bankrupt oligarchs?
“@SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"”Nice try but not enough!
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper or ISIL...whatever you wanna call 'em
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper welp ya see, #ISIS are actually the rulers of Hell. So..Hell is their home. So..that's a waste of a mission
@SenatorShaheen @instapundit Wow, Jennie. What did @TheDemocrats do this time?
“@SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree...terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"” awaiting def of 'manage'
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper Nice try Senator, but 2 little, 2 late. Scott will still win in November.
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper A manageable level is zero. Stop religious extremism & maybe people would stop seeking an early afterlife.
@SenatorShaheen, how did you feel in '08 when Romney addressed Jihad threat?

  @jaketapper
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper if she wasn't up for re-election would she be taking same stand?
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper Why not chase them where they are located--Syria?
@SenatorShaheen and killed? or brought back for a trial?
“@SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"” Interesting politics.
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper Tapper: ISIL vs ISIS? 
Ever wondered the diff?
@SenatorShaheen @jaketapper What's her plan?
@SenatorShaheen I agree... we don't need to shrink #ISIl.. they should be Annihilated!
@SenatorShaheen
@SenatorShaheen Democrats trying to distance from @BarackObama - you people are so obtuse
.@CRobertBuchanan RT @SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"
You and @SenatorShaheen don't think our military can "manage" the threat from ISIL @RepMcNulty? You don't have much faith in our military.
PS, I'm still waiting for specifics: Besides the airstrikes/logistical support we're providing, what would u do? @SenatorShaheen @RepMcNulty
@SenatorShaheen In words of SpecOps guy in #Iraq: "How the *%@# are we supposed 2 do that when we can't even leave the gates of our base?"
@SenatorShaheen an obama LAP dog come on stand up till ur re elected and then fall right back in line You are  Worthless and a LIAR
@SenatorShaheen No u let them cross our BORDER every day so stop ur BS
@SenatorShaheen and u LET them walk across our BORDER every day stop ur sucking up LIAR
@SenatorShaheen ha ha ha poll numbers low!
Biden&Shaheen 16? Hmm RT @SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"
@SenatorShaheen why do you refer to them as ISIL?
.@SenatorShaheen If you chase them to the gate of hell, please be careful not to enter there with them.
Haphazard table thumping not a security policy. Last year @SenatorShaheen voted with Obama to bomb Syria and strengthen ISIS #nhpolitics
“@SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"”///OD advocacy, really?
@SenatorShaheen Please reauthorize #USCIRF which expires Sept 30th. Please support the swift passage of H.R. 4653!
@SenatorShaheen this tweet is hilarious.
@SenatorShaheen @marcambinder How?
@SenatorShaheen Blow them off the face of the earth! Enough! That is what nuclear weapons are for.
10 more pointless years of war in Iraq. Best plan ever. RT @SenatorShaheen ... agree [ISIS] must be chased to the "gates of hell"
@SenatorShaheen A Crusade could do that!
@SenatorShaheen If ISIL dont run to the gates of hell do we chase them anyway or should we shortcut straight to hell and hope they show up?
@SenatorShaheen you create what you are
“@SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"” More war morgen Shaheen
@SenatorShaheen @AndStrats chased into the gates of hell
@SenatorShaheen Sticking with the Bush doctrine AND language.
@SenatorShaheen you go first our troops are tired from your unless wars. Take Johnny war monger with you!
@SenatorShaheen That is a no-brainer.
@SenatorShaheen Maybe you shouldn't have armed them in the first place you Fucktard.
@SenatorShaheen Oh what a comfortable illusion that you're not any worse than ISIL. What privilege!
Uit Democratische hoek “@SenatorShaheen: Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"”
@SenatorShaheen Does the current AUMF authorize "to-the-gates-of-hell" chasing or will a new one need to be enacted? Next, on Meet the Press
@SenatorShaheen When you arrive at the Gates of Hell, remember to stand in line behind the U.S. Drone Operators.
@SenatorShaheen I'll buy you a plane ticket if you want to go chase them. Don't even think of putting our service members in harms way
@SenatorShaheen You're welcome to chase them yourself...
@SenatorShaheen I still have a petition to remove you from office (25,000 sigs thus far). This ISIL comment won't help you.
@SenatorShaheen Please also chase the terrorists known as DEVO all the way to the Gates of Steel.
@SenatorShaheen @kasie "manageable" means precisely that it's not a treath anymore and you can destroy it!
@senatorshaheen The "I'm a hawk" and "Scott Brown backhands women" gambits are pretty pathetic.
@SenatorShaheen hell doesn't have gates you kinda just fall in
@SenatorShaheen Can you provide a latitude and longitude for the gates of hell? Might help prevent mission creep. Thanks.
You can't run from your past, you own Obama @SenatorShaheen
Do not believe ISIL is "manageable," agree these terrorists must be chased to the "gates of hell"
@SenatorShaheen Maybe we can manage the gates? @MomMilkshake
@SenatorShaheen Hell doesn't have gates, idiot.
@Soft_Serve @SenatorShaheen I take it you know from personal experience, who's an idiot?
@bow227 @SenatorShaheen Are you talking about Falafel Andrew? Yeah, that guy's a total idiot, and he won't leave me alone.
