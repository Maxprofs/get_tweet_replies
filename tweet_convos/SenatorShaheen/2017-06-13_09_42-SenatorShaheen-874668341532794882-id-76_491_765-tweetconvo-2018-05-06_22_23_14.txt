ALERT: Reporters at Capitol have been told they are not allow to film interviews with senators in hallways, contrary to years of precedent
Happened in Germany & Russia. Who's foolish enough to think America be immune? #TheResistance #HeroesResist #GeeksResist #alternativefacts
I would like to sue them but would need a lawyer. Any takers?
Please STOP the GOP from ruining our country.  Stop Trumpcare!
You represent us well. Thank you.
@GovHowardDean @kasie Thank you!   Am a fan from NY & ME!   Thank You!  #Resist #Healthcare
Thank you! I hope others will have the guts to do the same.
Secrecy  means you are hiding something. Elections Elections Elections. We need to kick these Carpetbaggers to the curb!
I agree not sure what they think they are aging by not allowing cameras, must have got the idea from Russia!
More of the accepted standards Americans have relied on to keep us informed of activity in government have fallen away in the #Trump era.
maybe we should just pass it and see what's in it.  also, we can depend on the ignorance of the American people #gruber
@kasie what's the BEEF DEMOCRATS passed ACA with no votes from REPUBLICANS DONT DON'T ACT SO UPSET ITS FAKE
@GovHowardDean @kasie we are quickly going down the path to autocracy. Chilling.
This is not true. Its fakenees made up by msm. More dem lies
It's appalling people have been shot and you're whining.
What was your part in the attempted assassination of GOP whip?
Okay, why do you want to go to war with Russia?
@GovHowardDean she is a failure - admit the truth
They are fixing your mess!  Why make it harder by including false and irresponsible reporting?
WOW!
You should have done Q&A before you passed the ACH. Too late now.
Wow!!!!  SAD!  
Instead of whining like children yet being part of the problem
With all due respect this is one of the reasons democrats lost the majority you guys need to start coming up with solutions to help us
What are your plans to fix it? I'm curious
You have had the last 4 years to fix Obamacare yet have done absolutely NOTHING. Now all of a sudden you have an epiphany because
@kasie Why don't reporters pair up and one take video and the other take audio, then play is on #MSNBC normal coverage. Easy solution!
What, are they afraid of the truth coming out?
Isolating themselves so that the world doesn't have to watch itself be destroyed?
What happened to freedom of the press according to the first amendment? Are republicans ignoring the Constitution&making their own rules.
You all need to say it loud. This admin and GOP are trying authoritarian tactics.
More rhetoric
Such snowflakes, if they can't stand the heat, they need to get out of the kitchen, our democracy depends on it
Why now? Why today? Another deflection by Trump and his people to take heat away from hidden healthcare and Russian investigations.
Overcrowded hallways can be a very serious safety issue. Find another place to have interaction with press.
waaa they are not saying they will not take questions they just said not in the halls. u want some pampers and a binky?
Thank you for getting the word out.
GOP monsters are same as Russian monsters  as they make GOP (shit sandwiches)  tax & burial plans, 4 working class, elderly & preexisting
Something to hide vs nothing to hide
Thank you 
So officially the GOP is obstructing our democracy and their oaths of office? What can you do?
Okay, do they need to pass it before they read it?...Pass it before American people find out what's in it?
The Press is there to watch and ask questions because We The People have to work so we can't be there to keep an eye on things.
Go Pros aren’t that expensive… have one of your toadies go grab one and record the session...
access and talking to Dems isn't the issue.
GOP needs to be held accountable 
USA Slipping into an authoriatrian state before our eyes
No surprize considering how the President has already behaved.
What has happened to supposed leaders like McCain. They should be doing something about this pathetic mess.
His wife just got a job in state dept.....
Please do not allow this UN-American treatment of the Press continue.
Dear Christians viciously attacking President Trump&his family. You Christians who are FILLED w/hate may I suggest actually READING UR Bible
keep us free to SEE what we PAY FOR @SenateMajLdr is hiding under his desk, come out sir, we see you & the lousy GOP, elections coming!
Everybody should email Mitch McConnell, call office, flood with complaints. His cynicism appalling. Doesn't care about freedom of the press.
God love ya.
With all due respect DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!
#Trump & the #GOP are hijacking the government. #WeThePeople implore you & other leaders of good conscience to stop this madness.
THANK YOU!!!
@SenatorShaheen I hope @SenatorHassan, @SenatorCollins, @SenAngusKing, @SenWarren, @SenSanders, @SenMarkey & @SenatorLeahy will stand w/you.
That's right! Dems get out there! Use your voice while GOP hide!!!
Senator, get off of twitter and please go do something about these things. #Resist
Senator this is wearing thin, the daily bombardment to our Constitution, our Country, and our standing in the world etc etc.
Thank you! #LiveFreeOrDie
Get every Democratic Senator to come out and give interviews. We need action right now, in a big way. Thank you!
How about a prime-time ad buy shining some light on secret GOP government?
Or virtual town halls using Facebook live. The American people need to know what GOP is doing or they will get away with it.
So proud of my NH representatives!
We have now officially turned into Russia. What happened to our country?
Do something about it!  Actions, not words.  #ShutItDown
Democrats must block the Senate any way possible. These people are outrageous.
