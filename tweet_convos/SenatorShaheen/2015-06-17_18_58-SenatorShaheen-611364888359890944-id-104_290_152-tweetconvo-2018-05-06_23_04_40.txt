How bout choosing ALL WOMEN for ALL BILLS for next several hundred years? Seems only fair! @USTreasury @SecJackLew @nytimes @HuffingtonPost
@UniteWomenNJ @Whatisupahead @USTreasury @SecJackLew @nytimes @HuffingtonPost  I second that emotion #womenonallcurrency
@shariannebrill @UniteWomenNJ Sure, find one who has been as influential as the people currently on the bills.
@MRomenesko @shariannebrill Me thinks Michael's showing he's 1 of many who don't know better than to only read what men have done in history
@UniteWomenNJ @shariannebrill Not exactly. And you didn't provide an answer.
@MRomenesko @UniteWomenNJ #SusanBAnthony fought for women's' right 2 vote. Are u disputing her value 2 advancing our democracy? #womenon20s
@shariannebrill @UniteWomenNJ I actually agree with her on the 20. I don't agree with replacing Hamilton though.
@MRomenesko @shariannebrill Understood.
@USTreasury Plz put #VictoriaWoodhull (1st female candidate 4 US President; activist 4 women's/civil rights & labor reforms) on #TheNew10.
@CaitlinMcWriter @USTreasury Or just leave Hamilton... the guy who had one of the largest impacts developing our nation's financial system.
@MRomenesko @USTreasury Because there aren't enough men on US currency....
@CaitlinMcWriter should be considered for a change.
@USTreasury Do you realize Hamilton wrote 2/3rds of the Federalist Papers? Is that democratic enough for you? Get rid of Jackson.
@USTreasury @ClayMcCreary How about a Native American? No, not Elizabeth Warren. Somebody like Sacajewiah or Pocahontas.
@USTreasury they should put Eleanor Roosevelt or Harriet Tubman
How bout choosing ALL WOMEN for ALL BILLS for next several hundred years? Seems only fair! @USTreasury @SecJackLew @cnn @abcnews @npr @WSJ
@USTreasury Looking at all the contributions by woman I would nominate Clara Barton.
@USTreasury But you will continue to keep a man who ordered the TRAIL OF TEARS on the $20?! Ditch Jackson. Save Hamilton!
@K8D84 @USTreasury Why limit ourselves to ONE woman? Let women be on $20, etc, etc @mashable @Slate @HuffPostWomen @msmagazine @UltraViolet
@USTreasury I go for Rosa Parks!
@USTreasury How about a Native American like Annie Dodge Wauneka #TheNew10
@USTreasury You should consider Nellie Tayloe Ross. 1st woman governor. 1st woman director of US Mint. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Tayloe_Ross … #TheNew10
@ProfJulieHill @USTreasury  

Louisa Gardner Swain would fit better
@USTreasury  Horrible idea !!
Hey, @USTreasury, why does the woman have to share #TheNew10 with Alexander Hamilton?
Although a positive step forward @USTreasury missed an opportunity with #TheNew10. Changing the $20 in 2020 would have been more powerful.
@USTreasury @SenatorShaheen u stink we the people need
@USTreasury If it's Michelle, Hillary or Nancy, I'll refuse to have one--print plenty of fives!!!  You & Obama will be racist with a black.
@USTreasury how about replacing Jackson on the 20? It's odd that we honor the architect of the Trail of Tears with a place on our currency.
@USTreasury how about we keep our forefathers on the bills and let a woman have the 50 cent piece or silver dollar.
@USTreasury It should have been the $20 to replace the genocidal  Andrew Jackson, disgraceful. #IndianKiller #SharpKnife
@USTreasury Horrible idea. Hamilton's personal story is an inspiration. He basically created the agency you're tweeting for. This is ridic
@DrunkenPromises @USTreasury common sense means nothing to them
@USTreasury Instead you should #dumpjackson from the 20. Great there will be a woman on money, not great Hamilton goes. #savehamilton
@USTreasury Eleanor Roosevelt: champion of civil rights, supported the United Nations involved in Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
@USTreasury   mother theresa
@USTreasury Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/USTreasury/status/611352350113071106 … (Ranked 25th for Jun 17.)
@USTreasury Harriet Tubman should be on the $10bill because she helped everyone regardless of skin color
@USTreasury Seriously? Replace Jackson on the $20 and leave Hamilton on the $10.
@USTreasury #TheNew10 Oveta Culp Hobby http://www.humanitiestexas.org/news/articles/womens-history-month-oveta-culp-hobby-senator-kay-bailey-hutchison …
@USTreasury inclusive democracy ? We are a Constitutional Representative Republic !http://www.c4cg.org/republic.htm  @HCimprimis @AnnBarnhardt
@USTreasury It's GOT to be Eleanor Roosevelt, don't you think? #TheNew10
@USTreasury #saveHamilton #ditchJackson #HarrietTubman #TheNew10
@USTreasury Condi!!!!!
@USTreasury Susan B Anthony for ten dollar bill.
@USTreasury -- #TheNew10 -- MUST be Eleanor Roosevelt
@USTreasury ---Remove Jackson and replace with Sacagawea. Hamilton's contributions as a founding father of this county are too numerous.
@USTreasury caitlyn jenner looks the best on the $10 bill.
@USTreasury @HarryHarryrtt: #thenew10 Shirley Chisholm
@USTreasury What a terrible world of outrage and appeasement we live in now. Some things are the way they are because it makes sense.
@USTreasury How underhanded to remove a great American from our $10 bill! We can't afford the change anyway so leave it alone! #KeepHamilton
@USTreasury Then make it Eliza Hamilton if you are so insistent. Portrait available. Pls don't think that statue pic makes up for this stunt
@USTreasury No need for #TheNew10. Get #TheNew20 instead and replace Jackson. Why would you replace the FIRST secretary of treasury?
@USTreasury #TheNew10   http://montanawomenshistory.org/merle-egan-anderson-montanas-hello-girl/ … Pivotal woman in war time and should be considered
@USTreasury Will Hamilton still be featured on the $10 somewhere or removed completely? #TheNew10
@USTreasury
@USTreasury I'll gladly accept your offer to be the new $10 portrait artist :) http://www.christianelden.com/projects/black-history-portraits/ … #TheNew10
@USTreasury Rosa Parks #TheNew10
@USTreasury Conductor of The Underground Railroad! #TheNew10
@KeithOngeri @USTreasury at this point we gotta be thankful for what the pale stale male government gives us tbh
@USTreasury are you people high?! #keephamilton and #dumpjackson!!
@USTreasury @SenatorShaheen #TheNewTen #Pocahontas
@USTreasury why don't you replace the man that caused a genocide lmao
@USTreasury Consolation prize.  What happened to @WomenOn20s?
@USTreasury Hamilton should be on the $10.00 bill.  Replace Jefferson on the $2.00 bill instead.
@USTreasury Elenor Roosevelt!
@USTreasury Barbara Jordan please! #thenew10
@USTreasury Jane Addams the peace Nobel laureate and leader for women's suffrage would be most fitting I think . #TheNew10
@USTreasury Bad call! Boot Jackson!
I totally agree— “@amyoleary: @USTreasury Bad call! Boot Jackson!”
.@USTreasury How much is this crap going to cost?  Those engravings aren't cheap.  I hope the Chinese publish all of your records.
.@USTreasury see prev. tweets for this citizen's reaction-AND to top it all off a MAN is choosing the featured woman?!?!? V
@USTreasury the intelligent choice would have been on the 20 to replace Jackson rather than removing the first sec of treasury.
@USTreasury #thenew10? #thenew20!
Sally Ride. #TheNew10 MT @USTreasury: Secy Lew will choose woman who championed US democracy on redesigned $10 bill http://go.usa.gov/3mvrA 
@USTreasury How do y'all know Alex Hamilton didn't self-identify as a woman? He did wear a wig.

#TheNew10 #KeepHamilton
@USTreasury Eleanor Roosevelt on the $20!
@USTreasury  How can you pull Hamilton!  The founder of the U.S. Financial system. Awful. How about a 500 or 1000 bill?  Sad day
@USTreasury boot Jackson from the $20, replace him w/ Hamilton and put Eleanor Roosevelt on the new $10
@USTreasury How bout WOMEN on ALL BILLS for next several hundred years? Seems only fair! @USTreasury @SecJackLew @RuthBGinsburg @Bloomberg
@USTreasury Hamilton deserves his own dollar. So does whichever woman Lew chooses. It's a fantastic idea...but update the $20 instead!
@USTreasury Why not Jackson? Hamilton contributed quite a bit
Not that I'm griping about #TheNew10, but @USTreasury has to kick Jackson off the $20 bill and move Hamilton there.
@robpegoraro @USTreasury as Biggie Smalls said. "mo' money, mo' problems"
@USTreasury rosa parks
@USTreasury Consider removing Andrew Jackson (supporter and signer of the Indian Removal Act)  instead of Alexander Hamilton. #TheNewTen
Hi @USTreasury! Use a picture of my girl @MegoTron7 making SAMMICHES on #TheNew10. (Or Eleanor Roosevelt. Equally good.)
@USTreasury 
I suggest Rosa Parks!
(1913 - 2005)
@USTreasury @TomFlowers You should put #RachelDolezal on the $10 bill. Fed Reserve Notes aren't really money anyway.
#NotBackedByAnything
Great news! “@USTreasury: .. a woman who was a champion for democracy in the U.S. on .. $10 note. #TheNew10 http://go.usa.gov/3mvrA ” @ICRW
@USTreasury Terrible. Replace Jackson, not Hamilton.
@USTreasury Put a woman on the $20! Leave Alexander Hamilton alone! #ImpeachJackson
@USTreasury don't change the ten change the twenty. #screwyoulew #changethe20 #boycotttheten #thenewten
@USTreasury My vote for Clara Barton who founded the #RedCross which represents our country at it's best home/abroad
Secy Lew will choose a woman who was a champion for democracy in the U.S. on the redesigned $10 note. #TheNew10 http://go.usa.gov/3mvrA 
@USTreasury Change the $20 not the $10. Andrew Jackson must go.
@USTreasury no politically correct money! #NoNewTen #KeepHamilton
Hamilton dissed. USA still too young, rambunctious, impulsive. Should get a haircut and a real job. @USTreasury @BlairHduQuesnay
@BobRBogle I want a woman on the currency, but replacing Hamilton is egregious. There are still some of us who know our history.@USTreasury
Jackson is the one to oust. Only psychotic President we ever had. @BlairHduQuesnay @BobRBogle @USTreasury
"Only?" Well, maybe. Certainly some pretty far-out neurotics. @Adrastosno @BlairHduQuesnay @USTreasury
Made Tricky look rational. Jackson also crashed the economy. @BobRBogle @BlairHduQuesnay @USTreasury
TD rationally pursued hyperparanoia to the last iota, I guess. @Adrastosno @BlairHduQuesnay @USTreasury
@USTreasury Deborah Cox (#CSRD) #new10
@USTreasury #thenew10? What happened to #womanonthe20?
@USTreasury You should redesign the $20 not the $10.
@UserGoogol @TheRitaGarcia @USTreasury Y waist time n money
@USTreasury Sandra Day O'Connor.
@USTreasury Mighty white of ya.
