when imoral criminal acts occur, selling baby body parts for profit,weAmericans should not have to fund corruption!DNC
actually it looks more like this
my bad, here it is
I mean I'm not arguing trump won the electoral college, but $hillary did win the popular vote by almost 3m
she's not my candidate, I made a protest vote, but I'm just saying Hilary got vote votes than trump
dont forget, @realDonaldTrump want to punish woman
Should we punish people that do something illegal ?
you obviously have no clue what planned parenthood is or the function it serves
I know that they kill babies with my tax dollars. I do not approve. Read much 
<2% of funding for abortion.  Kindly crawl back under rock you came out from.
One penny of my tax dollars spent to kill babies is one penny too much. 
As if over a Guinness, what % of your tax pennies supported Iraq war?
@PPact  fight hard-the GOP men have no problem w funding birthright clinics-purely religious bigotry
please educate self before posting
I think I would even let her/him slide on getting that education just delete her/his acct.

that's one of my Senators you have with you!!  Respect.
No mandate needed when u have the votes. Did u object 2 EC vote certification 2day? U could have made a difference.
Republicans do NOT have a mandate to defund anything. Democrats won popular vote for President, House-and Senate! @SenatorShaheen @Mattison
Popular Votesooo..what trophy do u get,popular vote..congratulationpopular vote
I think there has been enough depopulation thanks
they don't have a mandate to do anything with a candidate that lost by 3 M vote & least popular ever
What is this mandate? is there some rules in the senate where u cant vote things if u lose popular vote
Uh yeah they do, it's not in the Constitution dummy.  #article1section8 How do you force me to pay for another's elective procedures?
But not one word about the illegitimate Electors. Shameful.
until every child is sacred no ones child is safe
stop selling baby body parts. Stop depopulating ppl of color. Stop eugenics !

New Report Reveals Planned Parenthood Abortion Clinics Overbilled Taxpayers by 130 MILLION Dollars

why do you think it matters to GOP if they have a mandate or not? they will do what they want.
@PPact yes they do,the people that voted them in.time to stand on ur own PP
@RoadrunnerTalen / Or Anything Else For That Matter !
@PPact Defund #VIAGRA !!! If your junk doesn't work...it's NOT my problem! #PlannedParenthood 
@RichardLapchick I do not want to pay for a woman to kill her baby. The government should not force me to participate.
someone told me elections have consequences. Suck it up buttercup.
@PPact 
No, but they have given women a mandate to fight them tooth and nail....
Sorry, Voters gave the Republicans the 'mandate' to fix ALL of Obama's failures-PP is one of them! "Stopgenocide
@PPact I stand w planned patenthood
Show that U stand with us @womensmarch PP is here to stay. Show the GOP there will B no compromise on this
Republicans don't have mandate to do anything.
@SenGillibrand they need to period!
Well, they control the House, Senate and WH. And they said they were going to defund it if given the chance. So.......
@SenGillibrand Oh on the contrary...

@PPact Women who use their services should pay for them...Not the tax payer.Need to be accountable for the decisions u make.
Its A LOT more money not to keep #PlannedParenthood or a women's right to choose, unless your willing to raise & pay shut up
holy s*** my twins were cheap then at 100,000!!
@annie5133 Republicans don't have a mandate to do anything!
they don't have a mandate period. They also are led by a racist sexual predator who is tweeting away our national security.
@genezog7 Shame on them all . It's going to be like this unless we stop them !
looks like a bunch of mad pit bulls! Lol
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHOUSESENATEPRESIDENCYHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAGOPBABY
Thank you, Senators!
@frankdugan
@PPact it should have never been funded by the government. It's time to #DefundPlannedParenthood
I hope so
Watch them do it! We the people DON'T stand with Planned Murder Hood! #defundplannedparenthood! #MAGA! #chooselife!
@SenGillibrand Watch & see.
@SenGillibrand Get rich celebrities to fund this.
keep up the great work,
evidently Paul Ryan hasn't taken them to the side and scolded them yet!
Yes they do!!
@SenGillibrand I stand with you Senator I am #TheResistance please stop the the Electors affirmation! Be loud and strong!
@PPact My body+my uterus=my choice!!  Your body+your uterus=your choice!!  Your body+your PENIS=NO CHOICE!!!
just wait GOP has no idea what they have created . . .
@brielarson this right here is the war on women. And now also on unborn children since mothers will lose resources
We are so proud to have you as our NH Senator, along with Senator Maggie Hassan. Keep protecting women's rights!
You do know that they can't stop them, right?
Thank you! Americans deserve health care, family planning, and choice. #istandwithplannedparenthood too
So, aborting a healthy baby is 'health care'
Only chance of stopping @GOP is by the people making their voices heard. Call, fax & email them.

@SpeakerRyan : Or any "mandate" at all!!
Thank you, @SenatorShaheen, for standing up for the health of girls & women (AND MEN) everywhere.
take away abortions & I'll gladly spend my tax $ on PP, otherwise self fund like churches do
You're confused lady. We don't need a mandate just votes in Congress & we have more than enough. # we won
yes they do.
@SenGillibrand @SpeakerRyan Will someone please tell Paul Ryan that we can't get pap smears at the emergency room?
No, but you CAN get them at the tens of thousands of clinics that DON'T do abortions

@SenGillibrand   They appear they think they have a mandate to do whatever they want. They forget they didn't win pop vote
Yes, Senator, I really think they do.
elections matter was so 2008 & 2012
GOP doesn't have a mandate to do an ything. They are sitting on a smoldering fire with a gas can.
Fight hard.
lack of a mandate never stopped you dems from your pet projects
for sure the Democrats NEVER had a mandate to fund the corrupt baby butchers.  Let them use private donations
@SenGillibrand how can we stop this?
its 54 46 in Senate votes.  can U count ?
U can change the voting by winning the 2018 midterm elections . Have U seen Hamilton musical ?
@brielarson 
Republicans have no mandate period.
Except control every branch of the federal gvt, so they have that going for them, which is nice
yep and that resulted in the last two Depressions
#PotteryBarnRule
@PPact You keep fighting there.We will keep fighting at localState level! Be Loud&Strong!#trustwomen
@brielarson A government so small, it fits into your doctors office! PP does lots of good for lots of women. Leave it alone!
Fight sista fight
but watch them say they do and try to do it.
