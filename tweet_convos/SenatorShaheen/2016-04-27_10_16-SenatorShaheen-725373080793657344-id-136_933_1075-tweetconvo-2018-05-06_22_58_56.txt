@SenatorShaheen shouldn’t you focus on things related to your job?
@daverdfw investigating multi billion $ companies that abuse their employees is part of her job
@tonygig they aren’t employees. They have union that represents them and they agree to the rules.
@daverdfw they didnt agree to have collectively bargained rights violated. 2 judges said that happened. 2 didn't. &Govt has oversight on ALL
@tonygig I don’t see why people care honestly. A multi millionaire has to sit out a few sports ball games? Big whoop. Move on
@daverdfw it is not that. The lies told by @nflcommish are tarnishing Brady's reputation. Would you like NFL to lie about Bradshaw?
@tonygig Brady and his coach don’t need help tarnishing their reputations
@daverdfw ugh. Well at least my coach doesn't run on the field and make tackles his team can't
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Senator don't you have more pressing matters than PSI in footballs? Let the NFL handle this one!!!
@ken_yaeger @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Are you one of her constituents? Then shut up. You go, Jeannie!!
@TedWellsMustach @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish I never said Brady should be punished. This should be address by NFLPA not a Senator.
@ken_yaeger @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish She lives here. She's a fan. She sees the corruption, she can speak out if she wants. We support her
@Fanny_Baker God forbid she send out a tweet during her lunch break or whatever.  Geez.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx thank you. I'd love to see hearings. Regardless of the CBA, the fans should get a fair product.
@AnthonyCurtis68 @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx great comment. Arbitrarily removing draft picks and players taints the game.
@FanOfAll64 @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Tom Brady is suspended w/ no proof. In criminal court we have due process, nada here.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish sadly, the point is it does not matter. The public has no rights with respect to collective bargaining agreement
@LemanowiczFOX25 @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish it matters to me! I want Roger dodger outed as the corrupt, conniving LIAR that he is & FIRED!
@RIBeastie @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Yes, in that sense it matters. I'm saying this is a union issue, not criminal or civil.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Tom Brady must end his football career--not because of guilt but because of innocence. TB fan forever
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish no credible evidence u r helping American people, wasn't the PSI listed already? work on cyber-security,not PSI
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost is your argument that nfl went after brady with nothing but got lucky with all the texts?
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost no credible evidence except the texts, the video and the testimony...
@SenatorShaheen @1PatriotPlace @nflcommish @washingtonpost excellent
Love @SenatorShaheen call for @nflcommish to release #psi readings. Maybe #uscongress needs to investigate #nfl @nfl. Pull back the curtain.
@SenatorShaheen @RepJohnLarson @nflcommish @sallyjenx BELIEVE ME FOR PLENTY OF EVIDENCE WOULD BE CRUSHED, IF THIS MYTH PERSISTS!
@SenatorShaheen @RepJohnLarson @nflcommish @sallyjenx Compare: BG was FAR FAR MORE CULPABLE THAN THE PALTRY HE ADMITTED WITH BACKHAND SWAYS
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Where's the outrage this fool wants 2 keep Deflategate going? Y aren't people blasting SenatorPetty?
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish here you go senator, acceptable PSI is 12.5 - 13.5
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish Sally Jenkins has done some of the best writing on the ludicrous deflategate
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish is that right in the bill of rights? Constitutional amendment?
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx You're my new favorite senator - don't care what party you are! #FreeBrady #deflategate #Shaheen4Prez
@SenatorShaheen @4CharlesFrancis @nflcommish SenatorShaheen 1) He tampered with #Evidence 2) He destroyed #Evidence !
@DetroitSportsMa @SenatorShaheen @4CharlesFrancis @nflcommish Brady's phone was not needed as he was advised by wellls
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish  it is in Brady's destroyed phone-- we have a right to know what was in that too.
@JWilla_ @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Exactly
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish thank you, Sen Shaheen 4 standing up 4 what is right & my friend TB #12. #ClassAct #GreatLeader #BothOfU Lets Go
@SenatorShaheen go back to your job serving the public. get out of the NFL issues.
@dswiese @SenatorShaheen did u say same thing about Senator Arlen Specter when he stuck his nose into the NFL?!?
@umichfan54 @SenatorShaheen probably. this isn't a TB or Pats issue. its about elected officials wasting time not doing their job.
@dswiese @umichfan54 @SenatorShaheen If u read the transcripts u would know justice was NOT afforded TB12! Only Katzmann did his job imho
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish In other news...Senator Shaheen reports that she has way too much time in her hands.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Then perhaps Brady should have been forthright with the NFL/investigators, and not destroyed his cell phone.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish How about doing something about racism, bigotry or jobs?  Good Grief!  Don't you have something better to do?
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx doesn't appear to matter when you can hire a "good friend" of the CA2 to rep you, lie & win the case.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Why does the public have a right to know? Cause you are trying to drum up some votes?
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Should have expected comments like these from a typical DUMBOcrap.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish How about you worry about actual issues rather than licking Brady's ass? You should be impeached.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish u got other issues to more important, why are u worried about psi.  just another politician trying to get name
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx no doubt!!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Failure to release the results is being uncooperative; more so than Tom.  I thought the league wanted the truth
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish To protect the integrity of the league and the league's offices the data should have been compiled and presented
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish The NFL requires more evidence to overturn a call on the field than it used to suspend Brady #FreeBradyAgain
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish I concur.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Senator, I would also ask that the league release all testimony of all witnesses. No valid reason to hide that.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Thanx for sharing your views Sen! A Senate Cmte may want to look at power of league relative to antitrust laws!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish real info not what they gave espn
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish the country is fallen apart and this broad is more worried bout cheater Brady and his  ballz #nobody cares
@SenatorShaheen A US Senator should have more important things to worry about. Given the incompetence of Congress I’m clearly totally wrong
@SenatorShaheen @NYKellen @nflcommish @washingtonpost Senator, there are bigger issues for you to focus on....
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx please take this to Congress!  The public in the northeast is also getting unfairly screwed.
@SenatorShaheen @NYKellen @nflcommish @washingtonpost Boo hoo. Cheaters gonna cheat. Taped walk thru of Super bowl teams & others.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Why weren't the Colts penalized despite their footballs under 12.5 psi at halftime & after the game?!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish will do it when @HillaryClinton releases her transcripts from her paid speeches. HAHAHAHA #NoChance #FeelTheBern
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx are you serious!The federal government is getting into this mess!how about more serious issues!!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost Thank you Senator Shaheen! Hope more follow your lead!!
@SenatorShaheen @MarkDanielsPJ @nflcommish @sallyjenx it's all about #integrity so no chance Roger does that. We'll walk on Mars first.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Gov supt monopoly has incrsd costs 4 all americans at the expense of billionaires. How can your party supt it ??
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Qe will never support you and your party again if you do not fix this - shame on you.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Go get them Jeanne. My family followed you for years in NE. Make the corrupt NFL pay.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish please remove all their protective legislation, they are slime and it will implode. NFL protects criminals
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Not to burst all of your bubbles, but rarely do these people tweet, they have a publicist to do that. Lmfao
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx maybe the Senator should work on real issues that are effecting this country...
@SenatorShaheen @WEEI @nflcommish The NFL has to hide that info, it would prove that they have no evidence.
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish @washingtonpost We are trying to emphasize our right to freedoms. This is a disgrace.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish 4 game suspension for this type of unjustified punitive action is totally overly excessive and unfounded.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish I commend your assistance for the quest of any factual DeflateGate information that Goodell and crew have hidden
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Thank you. Outrageous that a man's reputation is held hostage to a NFL/NFLPA power struggle.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Did NFL attempt to influence SuperBowl? https://www.change.org/p/attorney-general-maura-healy-to-determine-if-there-was-any-attempt-by-the-nfl-to-inappropriately-influence-the-super-bowl …
.@SenatorShaheen Congress getting involved in a petty football squabble. Nice to see our tax $ put to good use.
@SenatorShaheen @DrewFustin @nflcommish That's what I've been saying all along. They screwed up. The issue is the balls.
@SenatorShaheen @cocky_patriots  they have no results....that's the problem!!!!! The Emperor is judge and jury!!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish so glad she smoked Scott Brown!  #defendthewall
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx You go girl
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish @sallyjenx he won't it would be damaging to nfl  #NFLlies
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Finally!  NFL is so corrupt it makes world soccer look legit.
@SenatorShaheen @sallyjenx what would make you think it would be honest results
@SenatorShaheen @sallyjenx @nflcommish @washingtonpost listen to yesterdaya tony kornheiser show. He talks to abby lowell about the case
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost I agree...Let's see it Roger.
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish @washingtonpost  HELL YA .. NFL should .. !!
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish @sallyjenx data collection was ruse for NFL stupidity it's gas Law not theory results r predictable
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish @sallyjenx good 4 u Senator. I'm from Boston the the silence from both our  Senators is deafening
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish don't just make statements do something about this crap.  2 games for hitting a woman 4 for maybe air pressure
@SenatorShaheen @WEEI @nflcommish @sallyjenx Time to revisit the NFL's antitrust exemption..it definitely is an issue for a Senator.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish How can the results not be made public ?  CORRUPT !  CORRUPT ! CORRUPT !
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx $25 I was going to spend on NFL merch will now be going to @SenatorShaheen campaign fund instead.
@SenatorShaheen  Demanding the release of email and phone records between NFL and Ted Wells will yield much more interesting information.
@SenatorShaheen @HardingCBS46 I thought he has suspended for being uncooperative and not for deflated footballs
@stickbam I work for the news and listen to Boston sports talk for both my commutes
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Persueing this agenda would be great!
@SenatorShaheen @tomecurran @nflcommish @washingtonpost goodell only cares about his himself and the owners happiness not the players health
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Excellent point, but please don't stop there, so much corruption to expose, such as leaking fraudulent rumors
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost wise words. Fire goodell!!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Do not let this be an empty threat. Anti-trust may need be revoked.  This is the only the comish understands!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx you have my vote. Twice! And I don't even live in nh.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx tell themmmm senator!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost Go Sen Shaheen!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Dont you have anything better to do on the Taxpayers Dime?
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Let's see an antitrust investigation.
@senatorshaheen jeanne stay your lane
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost .. The league will just fudge the numbers, so what the difference..
@SenatorShaheen Thank you Senator from Keene NH!!  #GOPATS
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish  I agree Senator!!  NFL is above the law though, ask the comish!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx can't- he KNOwS the truth but wants the CBA power- willing to destroy brady for it. #releasethepsi
@SenatorShaheen @sallyjenx @nflcommish @washingtonpost they'll make up some fictitious documents right now!!

@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Hey Jeanne 
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx I have not seen anything that proves Tom Brady did anything  wrong.  Unfair!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish WE AGREE!!!!
@SenatorShaheen Human rights should override CBA. Please take this as far as you can. You have our gratitude and support @DefendersOTW
@SenatorShaheen @stefcutter @nflcommish @washingtonpost Would you like to check the asses of Hastert's  victims too?!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish No one would trust the data.  The NFL's lack of ethics have been on full display. #NoIntegrity
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Thank you Senator!!  Shine some light on this corrupt Commissoner!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost Amen.  Go Senator.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish They owe us an apology Senator!
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx someone must be facing a tough reelection
@Mauty1108 @SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx not till 2020
@SenatorShaheen @WiseOne719 @nflcommish I want PSI results from last Season AllTeams-Only comments by NFL was "there were no violations"
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish Can you send a letter to the judges on the 2nd district court of appeals? This deserves to be heard again.
@SenatorShaheen just got my vote
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Give the cheap dictator hell Senator.  Live Free or Die.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx Thank you Senator.  Someone has to call the no talent self righteous NFL commissioner out.
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @washingtonpost This is true
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish @sallyjenx whether they release #s or not why should any of us believe them? NFL History of lying
@SenatorShaheen @nflcommish love you senator!!
@SenatorShaheen @BrettPats @nflcommish @sallyjenx and yet he will not god forbid his vendetta against Pats be uncovered
@SenatorShaheen for Prez!
