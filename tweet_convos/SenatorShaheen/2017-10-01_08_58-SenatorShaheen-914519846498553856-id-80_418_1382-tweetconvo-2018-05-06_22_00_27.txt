Anna Navarro said it best when she tweeted: “When Melania sees him reaching for his phone at 3am she should smother him with her pillow”.
Senator Shaheen, I offer you the same suggestion!!
Finally someone is speaking up about te idiot we have in the White House~25th amendment please~he is unquestionably unqualified~insame
Someone needs to put a sock in his mouth and take his phone away before he starts a nuclear war w North Korea !
Oh stop the self righteousness Jeanne.
Half the time I reason just let him have it. More evidence for incompetency!
True. And the prosecution
If only that would hurry along, I could sleep better at night instead of worrying about war with NK....
Put yours down & do your job. You serve us, not your re-election campaign.
Bill Meeks how do you call yourself a Christian and listen to what trump is saying and doing to our nation~he is a nasty human 
Senator, when are you going to call for the @realDonaldTrump to resign? What are you waiting for?
Another liberal Cuck Senator heard from
.@POTUS Mr. President, PUT. DOWN. YOUR. SIGNATURE. ON. YOUR. REIGNATION!

Better, Senator.  Fixed it for ya.  You're welcome.

Why dont you go help in PR and quit worrying about the President!
@Conservativeind @AdamSamuelsNH #CuckNation still asking for impeachment. #fools
@NHDems @POTUS you tell Him! This is why NH loves you @SenatorShaheen
With all do respect , Senator, you tweet just as much as he does.
No she doesn't
DUSTY OLD CARS
You know he's just going to be oppositional, but I appreciate you saying it.
PR is a humanitarian disaster and 9 million children just lost healthcare. He's golfing. Again
Not an issue when Obummer golfed, right? #CuckNation
How about @SpeakerRyan show up and represent the House? @SenateMajLdr, what in the hell is our government doing to address this? Now!
Same thing they did the past 8 yrs--nothing, except wagging their jaws and filling their pockets. You think it is different on one side? LOL
Oh yeah so you recall Obama denouncing his Sec of State and threatening nukes? Please give me some comparable history (ever).
No! Obama is one of the asswipes who helped them get nukes!!! Started with Bill Clinton! Bush, too!
You never said that when you were sucking up to @BarackObama when he declared "I have a pen and a phone". BO is weak and we all know it.
His tweets expose his true colors. #impeachtrump
He doesn't DESERVE the title. He needs to be impeached.
You need to be impeached.
I love you Sen Shaheen!
Stop the hate
Amen!
You should too.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. BUY SOME DUCT TAPE
Thank you from Newport.
SENATOR SHAHEEN. 
SHUT UP.
Mr President we love you

Thanks Senator for speaking out. I wish every senator, regardless of party lines, would do the same. He needs to focus on governing.

Why do you want to stop @realDonaldTrump from helping Puerto Rico or talking with allies about North Korea?

WTF are you even talking about? I call BOT
Tsk You discredit yourself.
Riling people up from your phone? @potus has been working but you are part of the resist. BTW do you work  Fridays from  DC?

trump=worst thing ever to happen to US. Majority thinks this.
#ImpeachTrump
That's was for the Clinton we now have a President get over it liberals

Best President ever
Yes. And a direct line to N Korea, with Trump on one end, scares the living hell out of me.
From what device did you Tweet? Put yours down and get to work
Yeah! Hypocritical liberals always condemning phones while using phones. You'll pry my phone from my cold dead fat hand! #MissingThePoint
GET YOUR WHIP AND SNAP CONGRESS INTO ACTION. They seem to be frozen by the gleam of your hair.
AND. WALK. AWAY. FROM. IT. QUICKLY.
Thank you, Senator, from one of your constituents!  ... we can only hope...
Senator, don't you have some legislation on which to debate and vote?
15% approval rating. Congress needs to get back to work.
House has passed 274 bills waiting on the obstructionist senators. They won't pass anything for fear of losing theirs cushy jobs
HERE, HERE!!
and resign.
Ha.  Way too late
Then come out with your hands up.  Proceed slowly.
 https://youtu.be/P1PbQlVMp98  #Amen. #Namaste. #SundaySermon.

Are you confused? OBAMA'S out of office
With all do respect Mam we are way pass scolding Please stop acting like a parent of little toddler & start implementing #25thamendment
And the golf clubs too.
You're my senator - Please formally condemn him for failing to do his duties.
He does his and there's
Also maybe not sit through a golf tournament today & get some work done. Not a Monday through Thursday job.
Isn’t he playing golf too #InvalidateTheElection #SaveAmericaRemoveTrumpPence #StopTheTrumpPenceFascistRegime
Someone needs to change his password. I guarantee his current one is DonaldTrump#1
Free speech only allowed for lying Libs!
The #libs are the real fascists let's remind everyone they are shutting down #FreeSpeech
Maybe if he actually does go to PR the cell coverage will still be so bad we get a day of peace.
Hahaha!  Your day of peace or no peace is determined by Twitter & whether or not you see a tweet by @POTUS ? #GetALife #LAME
@SenatorShaheen get off your computer or put down your phone. Then shhhhhh
#ImpeachNow
Thank you Senator! I don't think he reads potus tweets try @realDonaldTrump
Why don’t you do something besides send letters and tweet?
Like resign! #StopTheTrumpPenceFascistRegime

Kelly needs to step up his game.
