Dear Senator,
Thank you for committing to a no vote on Scott Pruitt.  I don't need to recite the reasons why he is unfit.
Thank you!
Take off your rose colored glasses and look at the women's march polluters.
Let's get some green energy legislation prepared for Conference instead of hiring Scott Pruitt: 51 votes NO to Pruitt!!

Thank you for our support. There is ONLY @SenGillibrand who has voted NAY for all Trump cabinet nominees. Interesting !
.@SenatorShaheen Filibuster fail noted...
thank you!
Oh that will do it. Good job. Do you realize Kerry got 94 votes and he approved a ransom payment to Iran? That's your legacy
@SharNeal Until we stop China from destroying eco system I'm hardly worried about a little coal. The debt scares me more.
And you will lose, again.
.@SenatorShaheen politics as usual. Keep it up. This is why the sane people  of USA are drifting away from LibTards.
Thank you.
They should Vote NO to having an EPA, the EPA is just another revenue generating business/job killing Gov Organization
@SierraClub thank you. Please encourage everyone to stand up for our world
Thank you, from a scientist and your constituent!
Thank you and please get Sen Collins and Murkowski to vote No as well.
Thank you!
another shocker! Is there a chance you might vote for any one of the nominees?
@SierraClub Thank you!
Thank you! Stand strong Jeanne! We're with you. #resist.
no no hell no. Get used to it Senator. Make this your default response anytime that embarrassment to humanity wants anything
Thank you for voting no to Scott Pruitt leading the EPA.
can you sum up the reasons in brief statement or is it an ideological thing. As a constituent I would like to know
thank you!
you better. As a constituent I'm a little disappointed in your recent voting history.
@RealAltUSEPA Thank you!
ppl that LIVE in red states know how to take care of environment,  don't need fed. help to do that.
@SierraClub thank you

Thank you!  This is so important.  Coal miners require retraining investment not the right to mine at cost of clean streams.
Thank you!
@SharNeal we vote no on you

Thanks!  We need you!
@SierraClub too bad you do not represent Pennsylvania  - bet @SenToomey  will be a yes
