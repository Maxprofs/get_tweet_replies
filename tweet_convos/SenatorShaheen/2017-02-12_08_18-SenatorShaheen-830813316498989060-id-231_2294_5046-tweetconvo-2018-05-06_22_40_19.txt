well, you have provided nothing...no proof..to refute this claim. anecdotal evidence on the ground in NH.
But he repeated "It's a fact, it's a fact." Doesn't that get him a sticker or lollipop?
it  is a fact. 37 counties around detroit were exposed by Dr Stein recount. lol.
Dems have selective memory. Recount stopped in Detroit after they found voter fraud
Recount stopped when they found broken machines; symptom of voter suppression not voter fraud
why did you lie to ur followers? Don't you think they deserve the truth?
They WANT to believe. Reason and evidence are useless on these people. Hopeless, absolutely HOPELESS!
The other person blocked me. I guess the truth hurt.
Most NH elections are run by Republican town officials. Like they're gonna welcome busloads from Mass???
ask someone from NH. BO's DHS hacked GA Sostate website. Hmmmm.... chAnging votes for recount?

actual humans then count all physical ballots. Conspiracy wld have 2 come all the way from *GOP* SoS. 2/2
yes. That's how the Dems did it on Detroit. Puleeze. I can smell the koolade from here.

FAKE SENATOR- FAKE NEWS? @SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump http://ln.is/www.unionleader.com/89FQA …
How else do we explain 60+ million voting for a corrupt, career politician and habitual liar in Hillary?
U weren't upset when BO was going to be more flexible w/Russia post re-election
@Summer_Daye @realDonaldTrump http://ln.is/www.cnbc.com/2016/12/n2uJQ … http://ln.is/thepoliticalinsider.com/1gLvW …   someone may be lying to you.
PROPAGANDA FROM YOUR SENATOR?  http://ln.is/thelastlineofdefense.org/oyXO1 …
@AyeAyeKapitan @realDonaldTrump There's no evidence voter fraud cause there's same day affidavits, no id required #nhpolitic
there's no evidence of voter fraud because it. Didn't. Happen. Period.
YES IT DID and YEs IT DOES 
#voterfraud #Happens #nhpolitics  Yes indeed Let's talk bout it
Okay, show me proof. Hard lined evidence, not just 140 characters.
if you knew law #hpolitics , you could see enabling  exists #voterfraud  #rampantt
Caitlin Ann Legacki- no voter fraud in NH Senator? One example
So if there's no evidence why be afraid of a official study? We want to know for a fact there is no evidence of voter fraud.
why are people so willing to spend taxpayer $ to disprove something we have no evidence of & not to feed poor americans?
Because corruption is a crime! Stop open borders and free food to illegals to feed hungry Americans!
but yet you believe Russia hacked the election??????
Why is @SenatorShaheen afraid to end Same Day Voter Registration in #NHPolitics? @realDonaldTrump @JamesOKeefeIII   http://projectveritasaction.com/news/fec-refuses-investigate-voter-fraud-even-after-evidence-presented-and-formal-complaints-are …
Jeanne you know what you did .. You manipulated residency voter laws & a committee should see evidence
debunked by who!! All the illegals in this country Dems fighting voter ID laws if it looks like a duck !
can you imagine where we're going, having advisors come out and lie straight to your face
I'm willing to take Bush and Cheney back
Of course you are, Bush is extension of Dem Party NWO!
I still can't get over this man not knowing that Russia had invaded Ukraine
Are you talking about @MaxineWaters ?
Remember Fuller-Clark who had 20 people from MA using her address to vote in NH?
Agreed; no NH voter fraud. But Ayotte refuses to condemn  @realDonaldTrump's offensive lie. I'm glad I voted for Hassan.
I pray trump will do a full investigation into the massive voter fraud from dem side. Jail will deter it
Where are these millions of fraudulent voters?
I can go on but the next election will be honest you can count it!
He should apologize to the people of N.H. and MA
yes and Russia interference too!! Investigate
He WON, so no NEED for recount. This no way debunks the FACT that there WAS widespread (non)Voter FRAUD. @SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump
if there was fraud, did he win? Confused!
Miller must be removed by any means possible. But, Bannon must be the first to go.
This is a smoke screen so we don't focus on the Russian intrusion into our election
now make Stephen Miller the next one to be gone!!!
Sadest Picture ever.  Crocked Hillary cheated her way in.
The Democrats are dirty, millions of illegal votes will be discovered. Everybody knows it
I welcome investigation by fascist pres, racist AG, and white supremacist chief strat...?
facism: the part where you subvert  truth, blame all  ills on a specific group, blind intolerance
facism: the part where you're convinced that it's not the rich causing the problems it's the poor...
facism: the part where they have everyone convinced it's a Right vs Left issue...
are you involved in paying people to protest? I wonder if people can be arrested for that?
we need to assure the NH State Legislature does not use this to limit voting rights!
that's double speak for allowing illegals to vote!

The people of NH are aware of voter fraud.  Conserv. are aware of your ignorance on this subject.
not investigating is like putting your head in the sand
enough anecdotal evidence is show from all the states it is a clear indication it's happen, not
a recount isn't needed if you win
so transparent why the 3 to 5 million figure maybe cuz u lost by that amount - lying liar
An incompetent fool like yourself got elected Jeannie and that is proof enough!!
Democrats and truth don't go together complete oxymoron wouldn't you say
how is it debunked if a recount wasn't done? Was it "debunked" in Detroit?? Or, because liberals said?
The truth behind this is the #crosscheck scam. Preventing votes from counting due 2 similar names. No fraud
@Lglwry @realDonaldTrump trump needs to learn his job and stop making stuff up. Their figures don't make sense.
@Lglwry @realDonaldTrump this is insane.Why didn't trumpsters expose this on the spot. He is lying again to legitimize.
Whatever! We know it's bullshit. Let's hear about this...
Right. @realDonaldTrump assaulted all attempts to call recounts, fought 3 efforts at recount in the cts. Just lies.
As a poll vol, these allegations r insulting. Like we wouldn't notice busloads of ppl? #sorewinner
Diversion

SORRY TO INFORM YOU. IN 2012, THERE WERE S0 MANY THAT THIS HAPPENED...
I'm willing to bet Senator, he does!
@waltiepooh @realDonaldTrump When are these boneheads going to stop on this? Election was over in Nov 2016. Do your job, Don
I wrk the campaign. FBI Dir created the loss. Spk/w many R women said HRC. But after FBI. Minds changed file under hatch act
But @SenatorShaheen the truth doesn't matter. The lies are for the #TrumpCult who won't read/accept the fact check. @KatG4 @realDonaldTrump
ahh but it's not impossible in this day and age for the truth to make it's way out  @SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump
They spew lies and don't care about evidence. It's disgusting!
And he can't read a tele prompter very well either! Talk about a mouthpiece! He and trump are embarrassing
@kikilala1 @realDonaldTrump  we don't want a recount we want a reelection!
is diverting everyone away from his corruption and his involvement with Russia- fact Putin got him elected
Shifty-eyed Miller lying liar. How is it possible Trump regime has someone worse than Kellyanne Goebbels.
And how was it debunked Jeanne?
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump didn't win the pop vote, it must be voter fraud, don't  like what's in the news, fake news..
Easy to prove Miller is lying. Find someone who registered illegally who voted with that same false ID.
refer to @TrueTheVote @realDonaldTrump
Please ignore Stephen Miller. He's only distracting everyone from the Putin-Trump regime's treasonous acts. @SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump

Don't tell anyone about the @Project_Veritas @JamesOKeefeIII videos? Shh....
Wish someone would stop them.  Getting on my nerves.
Why are Congress and the Senate tolerating blatant dishonesty from POTUS? When will the "checks" begin?
you do know @realDonaldTrump is a Muslim right
I feel voter suppression is much more prevalent than voter fraud
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump I think you should be more concerned with what the regime has in store for the courts!
That's a distraction. Look at the rest of the interview-The part about "the powers of the President will not be questioned"
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump Thankful to Trump for not costing the taxpayers more of their own money to know what we know
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump starting to think these folks are crazy! At 1st I thought they were being smart w/ distractions.
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump Stephen Miller went to the same pre-School as Spicer.  Firmly stating nonsense.  Another joker.
@noclador @realDonaldTrump And neither did Kelly Ayotte.
he looks like Joseph goebbels
PROOF of voter fraud! 50-100 Electoral College voter were Illegitimate. Votes should have been denied!
We've been waiting for evidence Russia hacked the elections and I am sure you and the media believe that.
#Trumps cabinet push Alternative facts
alt facts for ppl in alt land, wonder what this will look like in a history book 30 yrs from now?
@ursaluna @realDonaldTrump you could just say they lied.
http://m.washingtontimes.com/ 
see @Project_Veritas
This lying, whining, hating, bigoted administration has gotten unbearable in less than a month. #Resist
if you do not ID and verify citizenship how do you know anything
if it isn't a problem, national voter ID shouldn't be an issue
He didn't need to. He'd already won.
The WH needs to put up or shut up.
Hillary had to pay people to come to her rallies! Trump was bringing in 1000s, loses popular by millions 
@l_tucc @realDonaldTrump Terrible  to say but everytime WH shows up on news I believe they are lying. No faith. #doyourjob
Miller is the only one left that the morning shows would have - not after today
@SamWangPhD @realDonaldTrump  Shaheen has no proof voter fraud doesn't exist. Why fear an inquiry?Is it b/c Dems exploit it?
,He should of. Why do you Moan about checking it if you were not worry??????
It's time for New Hampshire voters to sue DJT personally for such lies.
This is a distraction from something bigger that's going on.  Don't be tricked by him
his lawyers literally argued there was no voter issues
well it was @DrJillStein who called for a recount in WI, MI, PA!
a recount that proved nothing.
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump Don't you worry, you will be voted out in 2018 and you won't have to worry about this anymore.
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump but a lot of people are saying it! You know what I mean! They are good people and a lot of them
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump Hey Donnie, you gotta start hiring better liars. The majority of us know bs when we hear it
and what are you doing about this other than tweeting?
Senator, why not ensure no avenue fraud? You wrong before; like Boko Haram not Islamic Terror Group #nhsen
I love the 'Shire, but it's not that big of a place - you'd notice thousands of new ppl. Also, screw him for the allegation.
Where have I seen this before? Ah yes Senator Joseph McCarthy. Fear mongering.
@JaneMayerNYer @realDonaldTrump  Pay Miller no mind. He has not grown up yet.
Its not just NH. There are 49 other states. What about this? Just one example of many: https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/830840284028231680 …
We have illegals registered and voting, dead people, people voting in multiple states.
Another under reported story. https://twitter.com/Varneyco/status/829381413183115264 …
it's not about what happened this cycle. it's a prelude to the coming war on voting rights.
@JenniferRGeiger @realDonaldTrump Stop talking about this. It's an intentional head fake from Trump WH to blurr focus
@ClaraJeffery @realDonaldTrump Nor Kelley Ayotte but Scotty thinks there was fraud.  You remember Scotty, the masshole.
Proof protests Rworking: Trump doubling down on voter fraud. @GOP must enhance voter suppression by2018 to remain in control
ppl can vote in NH by staying the night then voting, claiming residence of place at = fraud
Miller, Bannon, and Trump know its fake; just pretext for more laws to disenfranchise voters
You are full of brown goo and you know it.Either provide evidence or SHUT UP!
If 'everyone knows' MA buses ppl to NH to vote, why didn't #Trump poll watchers take pics and report it?
Focus on Flynn...
If Trump wants to keep it up, let's just call the election a fraud & have another one.
@ClaraJeffery @realDonaldTrump bubble boy Miller live in his own made up world, #presidentbannon should have known better!
@SamWangPhD @realDonaldTrump Investigate it. They control everything
And Stephen Miller is a racist!!!
if buses bringing in thousands showed up it would have made TV  what an idiot
@ClaraJeffery @realDonaldTrump if it's so egregious let's have a re VOTE!
@gavinsblog @realDonaldTrump This is a distraction for the Flynn story
As everybody knows, there's not been a serious nationwide investigation into the matter. @potus admin will
Nah, Shaheen-you lieMiller/Trump have plethora of NH voter fraud...and you are part of it! Just wait...
@GPollowitz @realDonaldTrump who calls for a recount when they win the election?
someone who didn't want to win an election
put ur money where your mouth is Shaheen how many muslim rapefugees r you going to take in2 live in ur home
Stop being a politician &Try being an American for a change even in Nashua I saw mass plates at the school where I voted
WTG Shaheen, give it to Trump with both barrels, besmirching the great State of NH like that - LOCK HIM UP!
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @CNN
I saw and heard @BarackObama practically begged illegals to vote 4 HRC. No evidence my foot! #voterfraud
#VoterSuppression is a far more serious issue than voter fraud. This is called #misdirection with #alternativefacts.
What's clear is Donald Trump has found a new LIAR...and, like Trump, he's quite good at it. #voterfraud #StephenMiller
he's good at reading a TelePrompTer
We should be asking why MSM is still hung up on this question instead of moving forward. Focus on Positive.
And he's ruining my last name!  My grandmother voted for Trump before passing away. Sure that is #voterfraud too. 
@sabou35876529 @realDonaldTrump
That's true but like everyone around dRUMPf 
He's an ass picker
A shit grinner
& NE X SINNER
Thanks-your response is now archived.....#MAGA

Is that a challenge?  https://twitter.com/senatorshaheen/status/830813316498989060 …
That's stupid. Why would Trump waste taxpayer money
-unlike loser Stein-
when he already won?
Gov Sununu will fix this problem so extreme leftists like yourself will stop getting elected 2/2
I'm aware this Sen has lesbian raped teen highschool daughters This Sen is a homosexual lesbian Demonic
So typically disingenuous. Same day voter registration in NH has been source of rampant fraud for years 1/2
Who debunked it? Evidence please?
We have some of the strictest voting laws here. He's full of it as usual.
Stephen Miller is pure scum and nothing more.
better hide the evidence quick! We are coming!
everybody knows! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lin-a2lTelg …
another senator shaheed doing nothing for the people, just getting a free check
WRONG. Why are you pro-fascist, Husky?
it's either man up in  fascism or die slow in feminism.... 
negative, I love women.... not fem nazis who try and convert straight friends into unicorns 
Women are in fear. Rape was technically allowed in Naziland this is scary stuff man.
those in fear R those that want separation from man, surrounded by warriors a princess can't be touched!
Says the beneficiary of voter fraud

#Trump claims Election 'watchers' everywhere! If so, they MUST have pictures! Let's see them!
Pathetic Twitter & other MSM. You ran with this on Jan. 25th at which time I tweeted many evidences of a problem countrywide
Maybe we should have a revote just to make sure? 
Why is the Media giving them a platform to spread their falsehood? No joke, Country drifting
This all must end
Trump should have won becauseHE bused people in&still lost!Thats why he claims voter fraud! he stacked deck
Senator, 

let's ask Chuck McGee about tampering with elections.
Russia didn't hack the election. Admit this yourself
#SoCalled #MAGA @POTUS Every Politician in Washington in both parties should take a Teamwork cue from #Patriots: #DoYourJob
They insult Massachusetts & NH! Bus loads?? NH & MA Really? This is some kind of set up.
@jen_ohm @realDonaldTrump @wahooforlife
My dearest Senator. You know his supporters don't deal with evidence. Feelings are far more fun... 
LOL!! coming from the SJW factory of feelings > facts, well done.
I voted in NH and at no time did I ever have to provide any ID or proof.  But yeah,  you're right. Lmao
@redsteeze There is & was voter fraud in NH & I wld be willing to testify to what I witnessed @ my precinct
Then exp the hispanic woman in front of me @ the polls who wanted to register her friend who ddn't spk eng.
trump, how do we keep public at bay? We tweet not factual info.
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @USATODAY  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/12/donald-trump-stephen-miller/97819774/ …
so how do we deal with the lies? So tired of liars and crooks getting away with this! We need you to help us fight this!!
.@SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump Gov Shaheen, I have worked as an Election Day poll worker in NH & now in CT. We are rigorously honest!!!
Hahahaha
Take a breath.
Selling fear is silly. My family has served in military since American Revolution, Civil War up through today.
don't waste your time, just block deplorables
What will you say when the DOJ provides the evidence? Sessions will and you'll have egg on your face!
Why is Miller allowed at all with his hateful, dangerous rhetoric.  Speaking with the WH emblem behind him was embarrassing.
Not only that, but shamed Jill Stein & shouted down any calls for a re-election or nation-wide recount.
if you believe this true, they all should have voter ID, to prove there is no voter fraud.
My polling place had 8 Dem/Repub watchers, 6 women checking ID/names, a cop, no buses from Mass, NO FRAUD.
show the data of voter fraud for all to see
@MarcNo @realDonaldTrump he should apologize to the world.
by "everybody", I think u mean Hollywood, MSM and far left dems - not everybody.
where's your evidence?
The WH sees NH as a far away place of which we know little.
If ZERO evidence why have  been deporting illegals that stole ID's & SS# & voted? Mrs.Garcia in PHX one
@PennyHicks13 @SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump My ID had been stolen! My life had been one trauma after the other because of that!
