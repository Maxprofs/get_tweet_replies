After reviewing your record it is clear that only Kermit Gosnell would meet your approval for SCOTUS confirmation.
Thank you Sen. Shaheen for doing the right thing. Live Free or Die!
terrible shame how the dems reject good men.
thank you
Good! But wish you would also refuse to reward the GOP's theft of this seat from Obama and filibuster any nominee except Merrick Garland.
Thank you!!
Gorsuch was dishonest at hearings. Obviously, he presented different self to GOP to be their #1 pick
Thank you
you and @SenateDems are a danger to our republic if you believe a judge should rule on emotion rather than law.
.@SenatorShaheen, thank you for your strong opposition to Judge Gorsuch and his bad record on reproductive rights. #StopGorsuch #nhpolitics
Let's not pretend this isn't hyper-partisan politics and childish revenge. 6 years isn't that far off, and people don't forget.
We can't confirm justice during year we're impeaching a president
You're a disappointment to our state and country.
You and your Dem naysayers should have Judge Gorsuch's credentials... Will you EVER represent Us FAIRLY?
Senator Shaheen,

Please vote for Judge Neil Gorsuch today for Supreme Court Justice. You all need to work together.
Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
Why would Gorsuch benefactors put up $10million for him if he was anything like he pretended 2B at hearing?
thank you
@kevincorke @WattersCollar @ericbolling @EricCantor @kilmeade @KickassMilitary @sheriffarpaio @USArmy @Judgenap
Thank you!
Typical Democrat water carrier in the Congress.  Shame on you !!  NH deserves better!!  Cant wait to vote against you!!
@ctlss THANK YOU!!
Thank you, Senator!! We need a more netural, or at least centrist, SCOTUS
"obstructionist games"
Thank you!!!!! WE cannot allow Gorsuch's nomination to strip a Woman's right to manage their own care!!
Thanks from another Sox fan. Gorsuch would harm workers.
thank you. Gorsuch would rule against women on everything
thank you Harry Reid! Nuclear option as Dems vote along party lines. Not what their voter base wants.
Thank you!!
Thank you, proud to have you as my Senator.
terrible decision based upon politics. You will not be getting my vote next election.
.@SenatorShaheen Tx 4 requesting an independent, nonpartisan investigation of Russian's ties 2 d 2016-presidential election-#DelayGorsuch
Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
After Sen Franklin's questioning, I would have a hard time supporting him too.
Great to hear!
@KMR31871 thank you
@cr8tivegoddess thank you !
Imagine my shock.
Would you support a SCOTUS nominee who supported Communist policies that are similar to Democrat policies vs the US Const?
Thank You!!
Thank you @SenatorShaheen for valuing the interests of New Hampshire citizens and Americans!
@teaseafilm thanks/it appears he can't answer any questions on what he thinks/but did a great job with 'by golly' 'gee whiz'
Thank you! Trump shouldn't be making lifer appointments anyway while under investigation. #IndependentInvestigation
keep your party the party of no. Hippocrates.
Thank you Senator!!
@SenateDems
@SenateGOP
Enough waiting GOP.
Use the Nuclear option TODAY.
Get Gorsuch in there NOW!
 Enough of the lying Dems
that's my Senator!  Thank you!
why not do what Obama did, a 50/50 vote, he reduced the vote needed to pass certain laws and bills, so let's stick to this.
@SenateDems
All you're concerned with are yourselves. Self-centered, bloviating liars.
@SenateDems
Do U really know how disgusting U all REALLY are? U live in some alternate world. Certainly NOT in reality.
@SenateDems
And so goes the Dem logic. Good time, get pregnant, & know U can cut out UR screw-up rather then B responsible.
Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
You're the best, Senator. Thank you!
@Plantflowes THANK YOU!! 
@SenateDems can't believe you can say that, he was good the last time he was voted on. Do your job or get voted out!
Because he follows the Constitution, and you folks can't stand playing by the rules. Too bad.
thank you Senator
Thank-you!
@SenateDems you will lose Big League next election!
Thank you!!
@SenateDems Shame on you!
@jaytay777 Thank you!
Good talking point.  Shaheen wants a judge that will rule as she wants him to and not based on the written law.
Roe Vs Wade was a precedent set by Liberals who wanted woman's choice over a baby's right to live.
@SenateDems thank you senator , we can't encourage republicans to further their corrupt agenda
How about the Democrat's obstruction for Bush's nomination? Democrats started the Biden rule!
why am I not surprised?
looks like the same dem talking points @SenatorHassan used. You are a dem hack putting party before nh.#voterfraud
Love you.  Also: is it just me, or are the women the only people working to actively hand this admin its ass?
the time has come
@SenateDems Thank You @SenatorShaheen. Much appreciation for your logic. #StopGorsuch
Thank you Jeanne! To be blunt, How dare any male judge rule on OUR bodies against OUR will? No thanks.
More bullshit   Vote the way you want to instead they way your told to.  Get a backbone.
*you're. She has a backbone. Weak men fear strong women.
you will be voted out. Think Hillary. #goodbye
Thank you, Senator.
@SenateDems well, that's an excuse
@SenateDems he is an extremely narrow thinker not nearly a Scalia who at least was brilliant
you hear what you want to hear. He's a good, HONEST, brilliant man. We need him on the Supreme Court.
Thank you Senator Shaheen!
@SenateDems thank you Senator, please speak with DEMS  who support this supreme court pick. Not for people
Like there was ever a chance @SenatorShaheen the stunts you  @SenateDems are playing are obvious and 2018 will cost you more seats
Political hack
@SenateDems can u say nuclear!!!!   Play the games libs and be the minority again and again and again
@SenateDems hate to tell you this but he will be confirmed. I preferred @BarackObama 's nomination but he is qualified...

So disappointed you and Maggie took party line here-now you are as bad as Republicans in last Congress!
I am so disappointed-have studied his record and he is a model jurist deciding on law and not social issues
Totally partisan decision. Shame on you. As an independent voter in this State, I expect more.
thank you, thank you Sen Shaheen
As a New Hampshire resident, I implore you to change your mind. His qualifications are stellar. #ConfirmGorsuch
I totally support your non-support, Jeanne!  Thank you. 
Looks like you can't play nice in the sand box. Time for our delegation from NH to be replaced.
.@SenatorShaheen Thank you for voting NO on Gorsuch who would turn the clock back for women. #NoGorsuch
@evolution2 @SenatorShaheen Gorsuch is not a good choice for the Supreme Court
thank you!
please keep your promise and advise your colleagues to vote NO!
Thank you.
In other words, following the law &a constitution is against your beliefs?
thank you for voting No on Judge Gorsuch. It is the right call!
thank you!
Wow there's a big surprise! Chuck will be pleased NH however will not! Good luck getting re-elected!
.@SenatorShaheen you left partisan hack off your bio, please correct that
did Chuckie 7 Diane help you write that because we know they told you how to vote!
we are behind you on this decision to require a 69 vote bar for  Gorsuch. @SenatorHassan please join this effort.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, senator! I hope to hear the same from @SenatorHassan soon
Thank you!! #NoOnGorsuch #Resistance
This NH constituent says thanks!
Thank you for doing the right thing !
Thank you Senator, we support your decision!
Wonderful, thank you!  The American people thank you.
