@AP @brian_symmetry who said cheaters never win ???? #NFL
@Dwinsgames another sore loser. Work harder
@JamesPatsfan65 @Dwinsgames not because they paid off this judge means he didn't cheat
@imemdoc @Dwinsgames blind minnion. Try thinking for yourself. Work harder to get better.
@JamesPatsfan65 @Dwinsgames stop being such a tailgating Patriots apologist and look at facts
@imemdoc @Dwinsgames stop being such a sore loser and hater and look at facts! Work harder and maybe you will get better. Maybe?
@JamesPatsfan65 what "facts" newcomer?
@imemdoc that's the point...there are no facts or evidence that support your position.
No surprise. Cheating is cool. RT “@AP BREAKING: Tom Brady beats NFL in 'Deflategate' court case, judge nullifies league's 4-game suspension
@sportsyenta sore loser. Jets suck.
@jamespatsfan65 SO you would support this decision if it was Aaron Rodgers in the same circumstance? LOL! OY!
@sportsyenta yes I would. I am not blinded by laundry. I can look at facts and think for myself.  Work harder.
@jamespatsfan65 Haha!!! Easy to say when it won't happen. Have the Pats ever done wrong?
@sportsyenta nobody is perfect or innocent. Every team has screwed up or done wrong at some time.
@AP Shows what happens when u destroy evidence and convince people to lie. Future criminals take notes...
@Pimp_Scholar @AP more like shows you that we still live in a country where you are innocent UNTIL PROVEN guilty
@_Dark_Mark_ @AP That's criminal, this was a civil case, furthermore "innocent" people do not destroy evidence
@Pimp_Scholar @AP maybe true, but the NFL took all the wrong steps in proving his wrongdoing
@_Dark_Mark_ @AP Without the power to subpoena wasn't much they could do. But not being able to find guilt =/= innocent. Like the OJ case...
@Pimp_Scholar @AP but let's not compare air in football to murder...essentially what makes the NFL look so corrupt. Attacking the wrong guy
@_Dark_Mark_ Just a bad sitch, there was obvious wrongdoing and the NFL knew it had to come from the higher ups but had no way to prove it
@AP Good vs evil.  #FreeatlastFreeatlast
@AP @jimrome F Tom Brady- fucking cheater
@AP @katomart wow. They ram fuck tmy saints along with Sean Payton but Brady wins. Wow. Now I no why I don't watch since saints penalized
@katomart @AP I don't think they did. But Goodell (I hate him) did try and do what was right for fairness. I give him that
@AP @jayfeely how do you feel about being a precedent in support of Brady???
@AP Brady Cheats his whole life give him S.B.x6. Martavis Bryant smoke a lil weed out four games. @#$%^ pats and NFL
@AP A professional organization did some ridiculous, unprofessional things and got thrown out of the door. Wells and Goodell deserve it.
@AP @kreamz_karim @_Bunsz
@Nellman_AF @AP @kreamz_karim such BS. I hope it becomes customary in the league that players and organisations cheat. Zero integrity
@_Bunsz @Nellman_AF gotta make them use the right charges......hindering an investigation was the play....not something u have 0 evidence
@kreamz_karim @Nellman_AF i understand the legal end. Destroying his phone + texts to the guys who lost their jobs is enough for me
@_Bunsz @Nellman_AF i bet u those guys get some sorta back pay or side jobs somehow.....boston takes care of their kingdom
@AP @HumaImtiaz Brady deflates again to win, this time he took air out of NFL balloon
@AP Glad they hear the Irish Mafia still owns some judges in Bentown.
@AP
@AP @jimrome    The Ginger Hammer gets dropped. Boom !!!
@AP Shocking but not Shocking #FreeBrady #smh
@AP Cheaters win against
@AP @TheJeffZito csnt f-ing believe it
@AP @jimrome
@AP @jimrome
@AP if they can fix the Super Bowl and fix everything else they can sure fix the fines for Brady
@AP what I meant was fixed the fines in the charges against Brady
@AP @SenatorShaheen Yes!!! Brady is exonerated, rightly so!!
@AP @MikeMill23 cheaters prosper, kids.
@AP @jimrome 2 things wrong with Brady: 1. He cheats...and 2.  He went to great lengths to convince the world that he didn't cheat.. #Liar
@AP Of course he did. #NFLLeadershipoxymoron
@AP @jimrome
Read full #Deflategate decision here: http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=484 … #TB12 #Patriots MT @AP: Tom Brady beats NFL, judge nullifies 4-game suspension
@MatthewDurand Can't wait to hear your leftist, anti-Brady, fanny-loving, saturday-having spin on this one...
@AnRiogh Pats Nation transcends politics (and gova/fanny rivalries)… great ruling, just in time for my ff draft tonight
@AP Maybe all the haters should read up on the Ideal Gas Law.... cause the NFL didnt lol
@AP no surprise here. Judge was prob his biggest fan.
@retrorecordhb yeah...because he lives in NY an is a Giants fan.
“@JamesPatsfan65: @retrorecordhb yeah...because he lives in NY an is a Giants fan.” Doesn't matter where you live. Still can be fanstruck.
@retrorecordhb @JamesPatsfan65 You know that's the judge the league rushed to get the case in front of, right?
@2xTum @JamesPatsfan65 I really could care a less. It's Twitter. That thought was so yesterday. :) Go Chiefs!
@AP as long as he's suspended from using those little kids balls, they can have him.
@opinionateher: @AP @eThrive shocker! 4 game penalty.....watch now he'll get injured and not be able to play for 4 games. Rolls eyes.....
@AP clearly not a judgement on Tom's guilt merely on NFL procedure. 2 me still guilty of cheating regardless what judge thinks of GodellBot.
@AP sweet now i can quit football all together
.@AP
Judge rules for #Brady, nullifies four-game deflate-gate suspension; #Goodell will appeal the overturn...
@AP Finally!This has been ridiculous& @NFL @nflcommish Please stop!U examined his phone-&examined jastrin-equip mgr phone-found zero-#moveon
@AP ask the judge who is his team  he'll  probably  tell you New England Patriots
@AP "beats NFL" he should be suspended and arrested for battery. Take him away boys
@AP The cheater got away with it. Great role model for kids!!
#deflategate
@AP What a bunch of unimportant crap..#yawn
@AP @roybelly yo, @ESPNRobertSmith what happened to your boy? He lost again, weird. @LeBatardShow
@AP @LancasterSports that is ridiculous.
@AP @Ike58Reese @MikeandIke94WIP guess we know who that judge picked in his fantasty football draft yesterday
@AP @1490WKBV bull crap
@AP #SquishtheCommish before he files appeal!
@AP the world is burning and we are consumed with sports @nfl? can we get our head out of our derriere? #deflategate #AylanKurdi
@AP ooh big surprise!!
@AP who thought mr. @NFL was really going to be suspended
@AP It's all based on who you are,  just like the NCAA.
@AP @KTLA he prolly a fan that pos
@AP wow
@AP @djdurkin wtf
@AP I am happy now!!! Glad he doesn't have to sit out 4 games. Can't wait to see him play
@AP @ESPNNFL @nflnetwork: I guess if you destroy the evidence, then court judges have nothing to hang their decisions on?
@AP "Cheaters never win"...unless they're man children who throw or chase balls for millions of dollars.
“@AP: BREAKING: Tom Brady beats NFL in 'Deflategate' court case, judge nullifies league's 4-game suspension.” #HailToTheVictors

@AP Fans will heckle him eberywhrre outside of Foxborough where everyone is just as drunk as their owner
@AP Also Brady should retire because he is GUILTY in the Court pf Publoc Opinion and will get no Natl endorsements
@AP POTUS should kick this judge off the bench! What a joke!
@AP @my1voice56 - Okay can we play football  now? I'm sick of the whole thing. 'Sick-O-Tom' & 'Sick-O-Goodell' & 'Sick-O-Patriots'

So they will be reinstated then right? Or are they guilty but Tom had no part?
@AP somebody got an envelope
