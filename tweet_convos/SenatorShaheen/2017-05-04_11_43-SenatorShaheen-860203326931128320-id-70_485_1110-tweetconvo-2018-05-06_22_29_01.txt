Thank you! As a woman with pre existing conditions I thank you!!!!!
@BearmanShannon @SenatorShaheen will U still vote yes?
Wagering a guess that she will vote against it after the collective  Senate rewrites it...those rewritings r what remain a mystery
So I'm not convinced unless they promise. Too many lives at stake. 
It will b interesting 2 see if she responds to ur comments/ questions. Silence will reveal a lot about her agenda and intentions 
send them bills for Dr visits. They need to have it baked into their minds what they r voted 4.

One of the reasons I voted for you. Thank you.
Thanks, Jeanne. We're behind you. #GOP thieves have no shame. #Trumpcare is a deadly tax cut for the rich.
Everybody knows that bill is doa. They just wanted to say they passed something. Bill will be rewritten.
@Trumpcare needs to be stopped!
Thank you Sen. Shaheen. What has happened to the Republicans?
Haven't change take it back they are worse .
You're right the republicans have turned into some heartless monsters.
We can thank the DemocRats for the opioid crisis, DemocRats own it.
Stop spending our tax dollars to fix your screw-up.
You're crazy 
She sure is
Remember how you lied when you said we could keep our provider, our doctor, and our premiums would go down by $2500.00????
Just wait for the ACHA goodies.
Under the current bill Snowflakes can stay on their parents plan until they're 42 if they stay in the basement
Why not stop it at its source?
Thank You!
They'd better make sure mental health care is in the healthcare bill. The president is in desperate need of help.
Thank you so much. Please don't give up on this. As a country, we are better than what they are trying to make us.
Why stop the elimination?  Absolutely 0% effective.  Last I checked only 3 "successfully" left program over 5 years (1,800 patients).
Make it count. Where are your rally's taking place.
Thank you.
Thank you

Opiods used improperly  are not a health issue they are a war on drugs issue.
Thank you for doing the right thing

Thank you, Senator, for your smart and compassionate leadership.
You really think the GOP members really care for anything other than politics?
Thank you.

how about a war on cancer instead of a war on cancer patients?
Good Luck, Senator. The GOP showed us today that they really don't give a shit about the American people. They are sick and evil.
F  U

All I can say to my kids is - thank God for the professionals in the US #Senate - the #House is a Petri dish of hate and jealousy
Thank you!
Thank you. We will be working the phones.
Didn't he sign an EO to help get rid of the opioid problem??
I really wish you the best of luck. There are so many unscrupulous bastards there, you're going to need it
