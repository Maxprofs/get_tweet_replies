Madam,do you care to pause &  ponder if African women want you unleashing your abortion orgs on them?@SenatorShaheen
Tomorrow I'll be introducing bipartisan legislation that would permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule: https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/shaheen-statement-on-president-trumps-reinstatement-of-the-global-gag-rule …
I love all the white American women cheering this on. #nonotreally
I love all the prolife people who only care until birth occurs then disappear, leaving children to starvation.
On the other hand, all abortion does is take a child out of the equation& does nothing to actually lift women up.  @obianuju
That's not what I've witnessed. Kids starving because mothers can't afford to feed them or abused in foster care.
I've been caring for pediatric patients for 30+ yrs. Limiting access to birth control & repro health is senseless
So the answer to child abuse is to kill them first? I disagree. @obianuju
I'm not talking exclusively about abortion,  as you seem determined to do. Your focus is ridiculously narrow.
Women across the world will be grateful for your intercession.... even if you aren't successful, you are at least trying.
Fighting for women's rights should include the baby girls right to live.
I'll campaign against you. Abortion is a cruel and murderous act.
I do scientific research on reproductive health (incl abortion) in E Africa. I'm so grateful for your push to repeal GGR.
Abortion isn't healthcare. 

No matter how many times you tell yourself.
I just started my new more active political life by calling John McCain, Marco Rubio and Linsey Graham urging their support
Good luck with that!  #MarchforLife #WhyWeMarch
Thank you for continuing to fight for #Womens #health!
#PotusIsAmericasEmbarrassment #Resist
good luck
Thank you.
Smart - further alienating Americans whose poverty & suffering is still inconsequential to you. They'll keep voting Repubs
Waste of time. It will never pass. Our tax dollars shouldn't fund abortions and/or pro abortion propaganda anywhere. #MAGA
might want to research how the whole thing works before opening your mouth. Wouldn't want to sound stupid now would you...wait
Jan 2017 Marist poll revealed 61% of Americans don’t support using tax dollars to pay for abortions.
If you want to help women, children, families start with America. Stop the foreign aid hypocrisy - charity starts at home.
THANK YOU!!!
@MarkWarner @timkaine please stand with sen Shaheen! We can be a great country and world citizen.
Shaheen was a loser in NH and now she's a loser in D.C.
I thought the DNC said white people need to "shut up" - aren't u supposed to only speak when spoken too? ( per the DNC)
While you're at it , get Trump to repeal his gag order on federal agencies. #Transparency
we appreciate!   And we vote.
maybe while you're at it, you can speak out about Trump's domestic gag rule?
good. Now why did you vote to confirm Pompeo? Torture.. Surveillance..What next?
Global Gag rule stops US from paying for abortions out of Country.  #NHSEN wants it repealed. Does #NH want that?
I bet New Hampshire will dump you as fast as they dumped what's-her-name.  And they won't remember you either:
How can you get that passed with the Communist Anti-Women @GOP in charge of this dictatorship?  Will it stand a chance?
Go 'get them Senator! You're doing a great job! So proud of you & the Democrats for standing up to Trump & the Republicans!
Thank you for your efforts.
Thank you for standing up for women and for reality vs. idealism.
thank you and @SenWarren! @beththemidwife @MidwifeAbby
Thank you, Senator. #globalgagrule
I have been ill over this. Thank you, thank you! Can our @VP (Mother Superior) agree to meet with WOMAN to see the data?
How can we help in Florida?
Called @JerryMoran to support repeal of #globalgagrule. If we're for freedom everywhere, that includes freedom of SPEECH!
U have our complete support Senator. We're with you all the way!
TYVM 
America seems determined to be the least advanced Western Nation on the Planet.
@kazil  trump is pushing Pence agenda!  Trumps BS too.  Why does he care so much when he doesn't recognize his own son?
You go Jeanne, we want our rights as women to choose how WE want done concerning our own bodies. Next he'll outlaw tampons.
Thank you Senator. #603
thank you!
thank you Senator!
Thank you Senator!
good luck with that #MAGA
Aaaaand it will go nowhere.
Thank you, @SenatorShaheen. http://ow.ly/u46o308iiYn

@SenBobCasey Thank you!
@Serabbi thank you

thanks for continuing to make us proud and fighting for women everywhere!! #granitestatewomen
thank you!
Thank you Senator.

Thank you! #tRump condemns women and girls to death with this act -- This is how he replies to #WomensMarch  #shameful
I'm a doctor & adolescent global health advocate. Thank you for fighting on behalf of women's reproductive health&rights.
Thank you!

Thank you, @SenatorShaheen I am proud to be represented by you and the other fine women of the NH Congressional delegation.
#Shaheen2020!
Thank you, I started crying for the women this will effect when I heard this
Thank you, Senator. I'll be calling your colleagues to voice my support.

Good on you, Senator. You have my support!
Thank you Senator Shaheen!
Thank you.  Learning of @realDonaldTrump 's exec order was awful. Glad you are standing up for HUMANITY.
THANK YOU!!
@scATX thank you
Yes! Thank you! We can't allow this nonsense to pass!!
@emilyslist Thank you, Senator Shaheen!
thank you for introducing legislation to repeal Global Gag Rule. Appreciate your efforts & work to help women worldwide.
Goodluck with that! We can use it to blow our noses with! Get a life
Thank for looking for ways to protect Women's Health Issues.
Go! Fight! Win!
how can we help?
Thanks for this!  Hope you will win significant bipartisan support to repeal Global Gag. Tell us how to help!
Why should we pay for this? Protect your constituency.
queen La-zygote? It's about a women's rights, you're on the wrong side of choice and history. When WE THE PEOPLE vote ur out
Don't bother.
bravo
I love these Sen..that are already on top of the #Her act
Thank you! Women must have the benefit of a complete education re: family planning--the #GlobalGagRule cannot stand. @POTUS
Tank You Senator Shaheen
Thank you from a long-time NH resident and human rights supporter.
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Shaheen!
@emilyslist Great!   Give 'em hell, Senator!
thank you.
funny mostly white women are having abortions and fighting
Thank goodness! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4iqVKMgNMGg …
How about worrying about the American people instead of other countries or start reducing your salary and pay for it!

really
thank you from a NH resident! How can we support you in this effort?
Ha! Ha!! Good luck with that!
B4 i pledge support, would like to know what this program costs the USA annually.
Thank you!
empty gesture, you don't have the votes
well done you for being the voice of reason and for upholding womens health and rights. #globalgagrule
@ppglobe Go get 'em!
How can I help?
@Humanitarian66 thank you!
Thank you Senator for fighting for what's right!
If you want to pay for international abortion, do it.  Just not with my money.
Thank you, Senator
That's new territory for you Shaheen. You haven't written or sponsored a bil that's passedl since you've been there
instead of legislation why not  private funding/fundraising. That way we can fund our consciences.
How about a gofundme page? No one is stopping you from using your own $. See if Madonna wants to donate...
maybe if you all want abortions so bad you can privately find it somehow. Or just don't get knocked up. #WinWin
@POTUS watch out... Women with short hair and men with chips on their shoulders are out to get you. Parasites
And it will not pass or even get a vote. Nothing like baby brain sucking grandstanding from lazy politicians. NICE!
why?
Yes! Yes! Yes! How can we all help?!
@GyaltenDolma Thank you @SenatorShaheen!!! #TheResistance #Indivisible
thank you Senator!! Anything else we can do to show our support besides contacting our Rep. ??
"What right do we have to restrict anything anyone says much less what a Dr can say to a woman who needs a Dr?" Abby Bartlet

Thank you Senator.
Thank you, Senator.
@emilyslist Thank you!  Let us know how we can help.  #resist
Thanks for this. We will all be forced to live with Pence's fundamentalist ideals, which is where today's action came from.
Well done for standing up for what is right
- Thank you!!
Please, make sure it's bipartisan and it has a real chance to pass. Otherwise, it's a nice exercise in dissent.  @emilyslist

Thank you, @SenatorShaheen!!
Thank you!!!
Thank you.
In other words: do they have an educated choice?
go Jeanne! Let me know if you need support through research or connections!
Does the international family planning programme help HIV-mothers to establish wether their unborn baby is/stays HIV-free?
