@SenateDems Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen - Fight for what is right! Stand up to this Madman with every ounce you have!
So big deal! They are detained for a little while for further questioning.
Look what happened at Fort Hood with a  military person who killed people because he was radicalized.
what have you done to help free the jailed doctor who aided the CIA in locating Osama bin Laden? #ShakeelAfridi #hypocrisy
@Honey17011 Speaking out is good. DOING SOMETHING is priceless.
Dems supported it in 2015
@SenateDems Agreed
R u voting to confirm his cabinet picks? If you are you're what's wrong with the Democratic Party. As a NHite I have a right to know
Overblown. You know military can keep them safe and ban is only temporary. Dramatic much?
what can we do?
@SenateDems Senator, HOW exactly are you fighting this attack on the constitution? #MuslimBan
But what are you going to do? Also, what about Bannon, what about Russia and the election? #StopBannon #russianhacking #nomuslimban
@SenateDems 
Americans deserves better
say no to everything and everyone trump proposes. Scorched earth. They were rhe same with obama without reason
many Iraqis who risked their lives to help American soldiers haven't been able to immigrate - scrutiny too tough.
@POTUS invoked a temp ban just like B. Obama did. Was it ill considered then? Or is it just now because we have a Rep POTUS?
Then how does it feel to be included on this list? SHAME ON YOU.
14 Senate Democrats have voted for every Trump nominee so far (5) 
You know who else banned Iraqis? Former President Obama. Funny how you never complained about that.It's almost hypocritical!
Congress needs to restrict POTUS Executive Order! Must have Congress approve them ALL !!
Thank you - please follow these tweets with unwavering opposition to rash and damaging policies and people!
The price we pay for incompetence! Trump is unfit. Time to impeach!
@SenateDems Stop Him!
you have my support go get em
So, Senator, pls get Congress to act to protect our rights, way of life by reversing Trump's unilateral actions
DO SOMETHING
and they are alive because of our troops, makes them no more special
@SenateDems Withhold consent! Never was a tactic more warranted! USE IT!!
@garz2656 do something! @SenateDems need to act now! #resist #MuslimBan #doyourjob
@PamelaRosePhd You mean the same ones Obama has kept waiting for years? You are a LIAR.
@Honey17011 impeach
Do something about it? He works all weekend, where is our reassurance from you? Not working this weekend?
love it.
@ChairmanBuckley We are better than this!
Please hold press conf with other Dems in front of Capitol - denounce the Admin; show unity in resistance.PLEASE
It's shameful
Senator Shaheen, there have to be even Republicans that can see what this is doing.
@SenateDems #ThenDoSomething

The American people expect to see legislation introduced ASAP to stop this madness.
@SenateDems   Not standing up to King Trump and his exec orders. Get off your bottoms and make something happen.
When is the Congress going to wake up and stop this man??
What legal action have you and @SenateDems taken today in response to the #Muslimban EO?
just say NO to every single thing. Start now. Get a backbone
@SenateDems fact check that man has been released and said he likes Trump.
Propaganda Monterrey.
@Tommy8668 JUST SAY NO 2 EVERYTHING TRUMP!!!

might want to reframe the narrative
@SenateDems let's see some action and less tweets!
Thank you @SenatorShaheen for standing up for American values. #resist

Those advisors love there country so much that they fought to free it. Not to get a free pass to come here.
@SenateDems You failed to mention that most of the civilian Iraqis that helped the US are already here.
@SenateDems speak up. Get loud. Protect womens rights. We r the majority. We r the new teaparty
@SenateDems   Agent Orange is a paranoid schizophrenic and you've allowed the election to be bought.To hell with all of you.
@SenateDems ACTION statement forthcoming?
@SenateDems DO SOMETHING
Please take this comment and DO SOMETHING.  It's time for the Democrats to stop saying things and MOVE against this Constitutional travesty.
@SenateDems Thank you for speaking out.  I have been very concerned that our elected officials are silent.
Can't Democrats please propose a bill to overturn this order and make the GOP vote on it
@SenateDems Time for real #change and start putting #AmericaFirst for the first time since the end of WWII!
This requires drastic action on the part of Democrats. You should all already be assembled in Washington to meet and demand time on TV.
@SusanDoyle1963 U think Bannon didn't realize that when he wrote it?
it's Bannon's idea trump's too mentally ill to get it. It's Bannon! Get him ousted.
@mjwolley do something
@SenateDems There are going to be some who are unfairly treated,but If you had done your job...this would not be happening!
.@senatorshaheen @senatedems Exactly Senator Shaheen, stay loud.
Shut down the Senate then and lead. Place holds on all Trump nominees, object to all UC requests by McConnell.
so how will the people WE the people elected to stop this kind of stuff actually do?
Please help NH resist this inappropriate use of federal power.  #NHSanctuary
