Hey Chris, are you sure students will have the energy to fill out the FAFSA after being starved by @MichelleObama ?
Really? You mean that haterade doesn't provide any sustenance?
Wishing you a happy belated birthday and many more. I’m now a cook at the venue where you had this year’s party, so if you’re ever around again, say hello! (In addition to the work I’m known for, I also briefly worked w/ the teacher who anonymously photo’d her school lunches ^_^)

Keep on Rocking Chris! You have a platform that young people follow, and it's great to see you use it in so many positive impactful ways!
SCHUMER IS PART OF THE GANG CREATING A POLITICAL MUTATION INTO THE ISLAMOCRATIC PARTY OF RADICAL TERRORISTS USING THE INVASION OF AMERICA TO DELIVER THIS COUNTRY TO ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT.
I think you need to seek psychiatric help immediately because you have a serious problem and hopefully the psychiatric doctors can help diagnose you and get the help that you need

That explains why no white house visit... DISGRACE

FAFSA IS A JOKE

We need more foul mouthed rappers on stage.....hahahahaha
I wonder if Chris knows Michelle was firmly against vouchers so inner city kids could choose better schools...Just stating a fact
CONGRATS ... To be on the FOREVER FIRST LADY twitter site is awesome . We just wished that the now she had told all of us about undergoning  reassignment surgery just think that  there are now 4 in their household without a sack. again congrats
I am non traditional student and I came from the bottom,this is something no one can take away from you.
I have a very nice family and a very good wife
Happy birthday. First lady and many more. From. BZRos

Impressive, Chris. Thanks so much for you doing your part in creating the next generation of government-dependent debt slaves as kids rack up tens of thousands of dollars of debt to be indoctrinated in leftist politics for four years. Awesome!
hey did you know that fafsa is actually preventing me from getting in debt and covering more than half my tuition
So your loan is preventing debt?
and the loans that they do can be subsidized or unsibsidized- one where the government pays off the interest rate while you pay the rest, and the other where you do pay the interest but it’s incredibly low, even as low as 4%
I hate to tell you but 4% on tens of thousands of dollars is not insignificant. I’m glad you’re able to go to school using everyone else’s hard earned money. Please use it to learn about the dangers and abuses of big tyrannical governments such as ours
Seems like you’re just against college cause there’s no way to pay for it without debt unless you’re incredibly rich.
My daughter filled out the FAFSA.  Approved for enough to pay for college.  Then the college overruled it and said I can just pay it.  No, I can’t.  So no college I guess.

Get Government out of the student loan program. Period.

Great idea. While we're digging ourselves deeper and deeper in debt with school costs, let's all sign up for crappy health care. Obama's don't matter any more

Happy birthday @MichelleObama  I miss the class, decency and honor you and @BarackObama brought our nation.
That’s really great and all but I am 186000 in debt bc I really couldn’t afford school making $24/hour. Sometimes higher education isn’t a perfect answer.
And PS that was for two years of private school 4 years ago.
Thank you!
So weird these days reading something inspiring and uplifting. Something that speaks to intelligence, education, a centered positive spirit. 
Happy birthday
Great job Chris.  Blessings to you.
