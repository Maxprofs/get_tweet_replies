I am happy to announce that I will be continuing my education at Johnson & Wales University in North Miami. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of my high school career and making it a special one. I’m excited to see what the future holds for me. …
Where’s this diversity you were always cryin about? 99% of one race is not diverse, it’s racist.
So wonderful to see @MichelleObama recognizing a future @johnsonandwales student!
Congrats, Destiny! College will open so many doors for you. Keep reaching higher and never give up! #BetterMakeRoom #CollegeSigningDay https://twitter.com/destinyy___m/status/991354285735796736 …
Congratulations 
We thank U 4 all you’ve endured with such amazing Grace during @BarackObama’s presidency. We pray our Queen @MichelleObama will run for office of the President at the right time for your family! We need your Grace, Strength, Intelligence, Compassion and Eloquence in office.
We can't wait to experience @Destinyy___M next chapter with her and help her achieve her dreams #CollegeSigningDay #iamjwu
You are everything a 1st Lady should be and more!!! #youmovedthebar #nooneevenclose #congratulations @destiny
@Destinyy___M  inspiring . I wish I could afford to step even a leg in college door. Poor background is trap
いいね！
Congratulations young lady.  You got this and we need you.
Great attitude. Sounds like your future holds endless possibilities. Go get them
Go do ur lou holtz-zig zigler tour 4 ur stasi-run military.
I'm trying to compliment your commitment to study hard work hard ethics and never give up spirit. As well as leading by example. You wear it well FLOTUS. I hope my words are proper and show good etiquette. College is a great path to take. Go now
Thank you so much, it means a lot to me 
My pleasure always welcome.
True and short and sweet. And I will add that it provides a foundation for learning and wisdom. At least it did for me. Cause I'm only of average intelligence. My transcripts wud look like finger painting next to yours. Straight A's but you earned them and that speaks volumes.
Congratulations
Mrs. Obama, Thank you for helping the young find their dreams. This 46 year old single mother (me) went back to school and will complete my bachelor of science this time next year.  I wish I had done it when I was young but I’m going to get there! #CollegeSigningDay
So proud of Destiny and all our Raider graduates!

I love that you’re doing this 
Omg if Michelle Obama quoted me like this my soul would leave my body
Literally, that’s exactly what happened !!!
Hi. Miss Michelle obama. Have Good. Day
Great to have such high profile support. This positive encouragement should reach the ears of all the youngsters embarking on college/university education, off to schools, taking up apprenticeships & so on. Be the absolute best you can be & enjoy the journey!
I will do my best, thank you for your support and kind words! 
Thank you for all that you do and have done to inspire our children! Congrats, Destiny! This is just the beginning of your success!
Thank you so much!
Lady Obama, you are legend...
Thank you for being so encouraging for these young people. You were a great First Lady, but your knowledge and spirit is much greater than that role.
I wish Michelle Obama run for President next election,
please
Congratulations!  Both my kids go to Johnson & Wales too!  My daughter is graduating this month to become a police officer!!  Go Wildcats!!!!!
Congrats to them! Can’t wait to be a part of the family!
Look at all those beautiful faces going to college! That's our future right there, and it's glorious.
Keep inspiring 
Are you Still proud of you Country? I can be proud again because you are out of the WH
1st amendment... You Liberals have personally attacked the Trump family right down to his 10 year old son. So that's ok right?
the door God opens no one can shut
With the income equality gap becoming wider under #GOPTaxScam  it's good to see smart, ambitious young people striving to make a better life. #BreakTheCycle You are our future.  and 
Ma'am, could I possibly get a shout-out for my niece? Ariana is a HS sophomore but just received her very first scholarship for college! She hasn't decided where she'll study yet. But she's so determined to become a neonatologist; we're all so very proud of her!
Tell your niece that some random, middle-aged woman from NM says "You go girl!"
Thank you!!! I will!! She’s such a great student, plus does all these extra curricular activities PLUS volunteers at a hospital! We are so very proud of her!
Woot woot! Just what this world needs.
Not a fan of mrs. Obama by myself I am fan of any young person who betters themself in education have fun study hard and you enjoy your college Years good luck
I get that she's married. But I love this woman. #ThanksObama

Such class, poise, genuineness, caring, encouraging, pride instilling, generous, quietly reassuring, and beautiful First Lady we were graced with. And how she interacts with everyday citizens. Man, how we were blessed!  Then I think of now- what in the name of God happened?
Ladies and Gentlemen, The REAL President and First Lady of The United States!!, @BarackObama & @MichelleObama !
omg, how have I never seen this beautiful pic?!? 
Please run for Prez, Michelle! I'd vote for you! We need you to save us!
Keep inspiring them @MichelleObama
I appreciate you, Michelle
You are inspiration for all off youngster we followed your path
We love and miss you

Imagine being randomly quoted by Michelle Obama 
Kanye West made it clear he supports Donald Trump. 

Kanye West doesn't support Barack Obama.

This is great, to see a student work so hard to be able to go on to college. Run for prez Michelle!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful!
Happy debt. Poor workers, greedy employers, tons of debt. Slaves or indentured servants? Or country is not running for the people. Only those with no money concerns
You inspire us in many ways... Love you @MichelleObama
Thank you for your goodness and kindness!

It"s not just black twitter ;-)

Who is Destiny?
Love y’all
They did what? U talking about adding to the debt?? Yes they did alright
Haha! NOW you care about spending... funny!
Typical. No dialogue. I follow ppl for a nice intellectual debate. I see you have nothing.
Well i totally disagree with your last tweet. I believe the wall will be built... and trump will find a way in the budget to take directly from mexico. Not sure how to argue that... other than have patience. Just thought it was amusing that spending is on your radar after clown o
You inspire many. Thank you for all you do.
Congratulating kids, not denigrating them, is how you do it.
America Misses you queen!
The WORLD misses them!
Great words!
Trump has thinner skin than Trojan Bareskin Condoms.... And that’s thin. Ask my 3 month old... #TrumpleThinSkin
