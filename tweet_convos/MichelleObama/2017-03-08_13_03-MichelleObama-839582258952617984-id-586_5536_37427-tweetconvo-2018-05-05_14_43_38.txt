How can one support racism? It needs to be eradicated. To accomplish this we must push M. Obama out of all media.
Recall how U introduced ur husband the first time? Shouting "HERE'S MY BABY DADDY". How can U think that's ok?
I didn't see diversity? That would mean others Chinese Hispanic European u know what I mean so many in world
To make it a surprise like that, is awesome.
Hint: Barack would make a fantastic 1st Husband.
