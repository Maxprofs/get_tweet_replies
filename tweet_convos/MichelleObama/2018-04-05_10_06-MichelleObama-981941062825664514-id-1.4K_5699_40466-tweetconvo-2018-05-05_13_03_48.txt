Amen!
Misses them, oh yes! But, loves them, and supports them in their continued good works for our country!
Preach it! Still going through withdrawal since they left the WH! At least we got to witness their presence there!
I revel in being a part of their efforts by "hanging"  with them at the Obama Foundation. http://Obama.org  Doing so helps me with living through our current ridiculous and troubling situation.
Thanks.  You actually met them?
I just love and respect you both so much. I'm a 43 yr old momma here. I have been accepted to University of Central Missouri, Fall 2018 to get my Bachelors in Social Work. May 17, 2018 I receive my Associate of Arts degree, 25yrs to get it finished, but I did it!!
You go, woman!!! Congratulations!  Onward and upwards!
Thank you 
Congratulations!
Thank you 
Almost 30 and about to complete my Bachelors and attend grad school for a Masters! It can happen at any age. You're the best! 
YOU'RE the best! Congratulations!
Thank you!!
Good luck Courtney!! Awesome job!!
In my last semester of my Bachelor's in PoliSci.  It's taken me TWENTY YEARS but I stuck with it and I'm doing it.  One more month.  

Never, never give up.  Ever.
Congratulations!
Thank you!
*Barack Obama AND I... not Barack Obama and me...  nah I’m jk, imagine being that person
Her tweet is grammatically correct. Me is the proper pronoun for subject - verb - (direct) object (=me) sentence structure.
I was making a joke about a person pedantically correcting a tweet congratulating college students... thank you for ironically doing just that to me.
Why even say it then?  What was the point?
It was funny
No, it wasn't.
Yeah not funny. It was grammatically correct, so even a “pedantic” correction is not necessary, correct or funny. Sorry, mate.
The tweets from this account always praise others - often young people. That's not how twitter works is it? Why do you insist on trying to inspire people? Where are the random UPPERCASE words? Where is the self praise? Where are the INSULTS?
Good one. Ha ha!
Thank you! I needed a fix of elegance, class, compassion and intelligence. It's been sorely lacking since you two left.
Replying to @MichelleObama and @BarackObama

I have been waiting for this news ALL DAY, Philly is soo honored to have THE MRS @MichelleObama with us this year for @PHLschools College Signing Day!! . #LetsGo #BetterMakeRoom #ReachHigherPhilly #CollegeSigningDay 
So excited for you!
Thanks Traci, we are so honored!
It took me 32 years after High School to get my Bachelorette and another 2.0 years to get my Master's Degree, but it was so worth it in the end.  Started my PhD,  about to be on it again as a Great Grand Mother. Excited about College@ MichelleObama  Thank you for your service!
Wow you are amazing!!! I know your family must be so proud of your achievements. You are an inspiration to all, to never give up. Thank you for sharing. Many blessings as you continue with your education.

I’m 52 and will earn my B.S.N. next month. Hard work and dedication pay off!
Congratulations!!!

Yessss
OH. Someone who supports our progressive youth instead of bullying them.
I sure do miss the Obamas. 
Class.
Intelligence.
Dignity.
This should be bigger than any college sports signing day. #CollegeSigningDay
That would be awesome!  Push it!
Come to my college signing day in 2025 please 
We miss both of U; the Class, Dedication, Caring with true Christian Values 4 "the least of our brothers"! May God continue 2 Bless the entire family of Citizens Barack and Michelle Obama & thank U 4 making us proud we voted 4 U twice!!
One tweet and it feels like the sun came up. I miss goodness. Thanks for the glimpse, FLOTUS.
I read “goodness” as “goddess” and thought, “correct” 
Goodness, Goddess, either works.
As a Canadian & mother of a college age student I appreciate those words, especially because we have an global generation of young girls and boys watching America. Your words and leadership truly reflect not only American values but human morals & values as well.
I say the new administration does not represent the majority of Americans with conviction. Simply because I have seen the youth of America speak powerfully & with complete clarity about what and who Americans are. They go further and give true leadership globally!
My favorite First Lady.  We love you from here to eternity.

Everything Trump isnt. No wonder he is so jealous. He will never reach their heights. I am not talking about poll numbers. They are Human and Humain    and normal but highly intelligent and well educated people. Love em. Miss em. Need em..
Makes me want to cry when we hear from @MichelleObama and @BarackObama 
All class, all the time. 

#Impeach45

I agree with you & I hope that you also recognize those students who choose NOT to go to college &/or decide to attend a trade school (come on!  We need those plumbers, electricians, glassiers, carpenters, etc!).  I feel our country does not honor these trades enough.  I miss U!
Shout out to my Grandmother, Roxie L. Ewer, who against all odds, signed up in 1902 and graduated with honors in 1907 from Kittrell State College!!! @MichelleObama @BarackObama #CollegeSigningDay Congrats To All!!!
This teacher proudly welcomes you to @PhiladelphiaGov !
I miss you @MichelleObama
Love you Ma’am
We certainly love and miss you! Thank you for being the example of style, grace, class and excellence!
I love how that DUDE fooled the majority of the country and pretended to be a "woman" That's a #Tranny, pure and simple folks.....the joke is on you!
Is that your thing? You seem to be an expert in the matter.
As the NFL’s 1st African American Female Coach...I am very proud of our College Bound Children!
Wow! Philadelphia is my hometown and home of my alma mater @TempleUniv the school which my daughter @raven_risco has also chosen! We wish we could join you Mrs. @MichelleObama. #TempleLegacy #TempleMade
Could totally see @MichelleObama yelling out, "TUMF!!"
I forgot the #TUMF hashtag @chriso627!!
Thank you for inspiring us! Nothing but respect for my FLOTUS.

Best FLOTUS of All Time 
#ThanksObama
Todo lo que haces es bueno porque brota de un hermoso corazón.
Claro que si!!!
Michelle Obama is the best first lady ever!
Hey Michelle, so she is a role model for your girls??You liberals love to sexualize the children early. THE 20 RAUNCHIEST LYRICS ON BEYONCE'S NEW ALBUM http://fuse.tv/2013/12/beyonc …
Hey Michelle.  I thought of putting some of the lyrics to your girls role models on here but they were too raunchy even for Twitter.  What the hell kind of parents let their kids listen to just filth.
Lyrics and music by Michelle and Obama’s favorite musicians (musicians ) http://metrolyrics.com/fuckwithmeyouk …
You are amazing! You inspire all!! You have class!!!
We miss you and your family every day for just this kind of gesture of kindness. And yes, go college students!
I agree! But I wish we had #collegesigningday for potential teachers, nurses, engineers, artists, farmers...you get my point. LOve you Mrs. Obama. <3 #GoGators
Thank you Michelle Obama for your leadership and legacy! #bestfirstladyofalltime
thank you 
We miss you all!!!
i love you 
Then Tell us again how Hillary was the most fit to be president, oh wise one.
Says the gal that only was proud of America one day...
Too bad the Obama's kindness is not contagious, we could really use an outbreak of it
ReShawna sister preach on
Yay for having student loans and not being able to find a job that pays more then 14$ and hour.
Keep pushing and praying! 
I remember how I felt committing to @Rutgers
Please run in '20
I got my BS in  6/2014.  At 50.  Always wanted to be a college grad, so I did it. Work & school full time for 16 months. And now one of my staff is taking pre-reqs to go to pharmacy school at 34.  Full time, work full time, 2 kids.  #ItsNeverTooLate
We miss you so much!!!
When Michelle Obama visited San Antonio for our #CollegeSingingDay#, I had the opportunity to be hugged by Mrs. Obama! It was an amazing day, for me as a HS counselor! I know she made a difference for our students!!
Thank you for your continuous effort to empower kids to follow their dreams. They don't hear it enough and many do not even gear it from their own family. Thank you . I admire you so much for your humanity towards people especially children. They all deserve that!!!
To: FLOTUS
From: Every citizen on Earth
Message: Please run for POTUS in 2020.
WE LOVE YOU MICHELLE! 

Plz fix everything now.
Yes!!! We miss U 
From the time you became the First Lady you urged your nation to treat others with respect and dignity. History has given you the chance to demonstrate that to the world and more than ever, we need to emulate it. As you say, our children are watching and listening.
I wish all living presidents would get out there together and call out trump for his corruption. I know it can't happen, but it would be so awesome!
Hey Michelle I read your comment on the good parent ?? Didn’t you let your daughter intern with Weinstein?? Was that good parenting or where you just paying Harvey back ???you know for the contributions 
Also last I knew Trump raised some pretty exceptional successful, respectable kids.
I'm a proud Aunt of two college babies... one who's in clinicals and the other is finishing her freshman year!!!!
Yes! Keep them lifted up high & stay in touch with them while they are in school. Never let go of our young people's hand!
Glad to have graduated! Goodluck new students!!
@MichelleObama our prayers are solidly behind you and the new college students. By the power of the almighty God in me, I decree this students will learn and remember all the skills and knowledge that will make them leaders & a blessing to their generation & future generations
Powerful! We need to remember to keep our forerunners lifted in prayer!
Leaders 
While on campus, you should stop by Temple’s Media Studies Student Awards on the same day. See the great work our students are doing.
Blessed by blessed thank you your globally #inspirational
Keep being you Michelle. God Bless the Obama Family.
You also inspire many Canadians as well 
Missing Michelle!
We are absolutely delighted that @MichelleObama will be celebrating #CollegeSigningDay2018 in Philly. Thanks to @MichelleObama and @BarackObama for inspiring our college bound students. We are looking forward to celebrating our graduating seniors #ReachHigherPhilly #TempleUniv.
You are truly missed 
My daughter got into 9 out of 9 colleges she applied to & got an academic scholarship 2 every one. I am middle class and have saved 55K for her. After scholarships her options range from 62K per yr, to 25K per yr. I can't afford any of them . Something is very wrong here!!!!

@BetterMakeRoom you're amazing,  great leader
You’re both legends to those those that you inspire.
I'm so in awe of college-bound students all over the country—you inspire @BarackObama and me every day. We know how hard you’ve worked to make your college dreams a reality. That’s why #CollegeSigningDay is one of my favorite traditions. I can’t wait to celebrate in Philly! …


You have something to say about Donald J Trump the Great President Ever do you ?
What the Obamas were lacking was (and still is) INTEGRITY.
@Jltmoss @YouthJamaica @annmarievazja @BarackObama @owenjamesja @THEJAMAICANMAG @TheEllenShow a few of my Fave . @serenawilliams @usainbolt
Nuff Love
Thank you

My First Lady, forever and always! You and @BarackObama continue to do amazing things! @MichelleObama
So please explain how your husband asked us to “eat our vegetables” while he was doubling the national debt, basically creating more debt than all 43 of his predecessors combined, all in order to continue the countless gov giveaways that future generations will have to pay for.
As a @TempleUniv @admissionsTU professional, I would LOVE to be in the room for this. I have worked for the last 7.5 years to get students to and through college on behalf of Temple and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. @MichelleObama: make my dreams and have me as your guest?
I like you Obama's family
Democrats
I’m so in awe that you are still sewing division! Still so angry that WE rejected the failed policies of your husband & elected Pres. Trump! U bashed HRC when she ran against your husband! Now she’s so great? We did not TRUST her! Get it through your head. MAGA
Thank You @MichelleObama and @BetterMakeRoom for choosing Philadelphia and @reachhigherPHL! We are honored to have you and are super excited! #CollegeSigningDay #BetterMakeRoom #ReachHigherPhilly
You are really.....the best of best
Now there is a classy couple They have grace dignity Miss them.  @realDonaldTrump has no morals no heart no nothing but shame
Thank you Obamas for inspiring our young people to develop their minds! We need our leaders to believe in education as well as serve as models for rational thought and discourse.
America is missing @BarackObama and our First Lady @MichelleObama. 
Even after leaving office and joining the private spectrum.. President Obama and Michelle Obama continue to influence and inspire our youth and country..

Thank you and God Bless both of you... you're truly loved!

STAY FABULOUS STAY FOREVER BLESSED. You make GOD smile my lovely LOVEBIRDS! Me too
We miss you Michelle!!!!!
Loved you in Star Wars as Hans Solo sidekick.
Thank you President Trump. Americans stand with you
My daughter was to draw a picture and write a story on a women she finds inspirational and she picked you. The stories  hung up in the school. She’s older than in the picture, she is  11 now and in the 5th grade. Thank you for being such a positive role model for our girls.
Love this!
You’re the best!!! Can I come

We are excited to host you, ma’am! #CollegeSigningDay #Philly
Thank God or Allah your husband is no longer destroying the great USA
The grown up parent?? What a joke you are. Stop insulting our President, classless as always.
U were the WORST 1st lady this country had ever had & your husband was the worst president ever, Trump is a pretty great dad because his kids show it, your daughter was caught smoking what now? #MAGA!
Love you...miss you....
Oh for the good years with sane people running our country.

you are my first Lady too even if I´m from Finland
And no matter ones age, it's Never too late!
I'm proof of that.

Welcome back to Kenya
Very happy for you all
Why Ohhh why can't the Obama's still lead the American people. Look Americans a tweet with a positive message.
We are so excited to meet you! Bringing my amazing seniors!
Can’t overstate how much you, President Obama and your daughters are missed.
I bet this means a lot coming from Satan. 
This account is for satire purposes, but my words are 100% authentic.
The good people in America are still awe of you as a woman. As a wife. As a lawyer. And as a mom. Miss you every single day.
Could you please message me! Courtneysavoy@Gmail.com to visit my school in DC for signing day. Coolidge High
We sure need you kindness, compassion and your Grace back in the White house ! Miss you both Terribly.
My nephew was just accepted to @NCSSM (a 2 year academically gifted High School in NC) and I have never been prouder. Needless to say he is excited. What a wonderful time to witness kids achieve their dreams and goals.
PLEASE AMERICAN IMPEACHMENT DONALD J TRUMP
Please run in 2020.
Thank you First Lady Michelle. 
Hi Michelle. What were you doing while those children were raped in Afghanistan during your husband's administration? 
'We heard them screaming': US troops told to ignore Afghan soldiers abusing boys – report
https://www.rt.com/news/316062-afghan-soldiers-abuse-children/amp/ …
Is this really the best time and place you could find to make your complaint?
Yes, until the Obamas acknowledge the suffering of those children.
First Lady  All class and elegance 
Of course, First Lady Michelle Obama still so active in the communities and helping to educate our youth. She rocks!
 her & @BarackObama 
You are an inspiration and the President also the both of you touched the heart's of Millions, I love you both wishing the very best for your family
Thank you
Miss you two so much, the world has not been the same since you and President Obama left.
Miss you  two
Wow , how cool are the Obama’s ? Super cool and sexy as hell.
Unfortunately, most people going to college will find there are not jobs that match their degrees. They would have been better off going to a vocational school, learning a trade. Your pro-College stance has crippled these children, who will have debt for the rest of their lives.
You know, one person don't do it all so why don't you take on that task to be a voice for vocational trades while she speaks to those who WANT to be college bound
See, the sad thing about you is, in 50 years you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own and you're going to come up with the fact that you dropped $150 grand on a f#ckin' education you could have got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library!
Spoken like a true high school dropout.
....you?
Nah, I was speaking to @45for8. I know the value of a good education, both for a job and for cognitive reserve.
Actually I was just quoting Good Will Hunting 
You are delusional if you thought for a second that Hillary would have been more perfect than Trump! Look at what he’s accomplishing! Your husband almost destroyed our country.. Trump is getting things done! Now it’s being uncovered that your husband spied on Americans..Go away
My Forever First Lady And Forever President I miss that leadership duo
Thank you Michelle Obama for always encouraging the youth and adults. Love and miss you and Barack Obama.
Just think of all those thousands of students getting into a life time of debt that your husband help make inescapable and empowered the collection agencies to destroy people's lives. You must be so proud. When you sell out, you go all the way.
Love and MISS you both! But we are getting STRONGER by the min. #BeTheWave2018
Why. They will have huge debt for useless degree.  And still make less then mechanics and welders. Higher education has peaked for now and until Marx is out  degree will be useless
Robots are replacing physical laborers. Technology skills will be the primary focus.
Bow t ur robot over lords ... this sucks all my anti commie stuff and robot take over....yes but many trade will flourish and so will service jobs but well a degree in women’s studies ant gonna drive a 80 thousand pound self driving truck of tomorrow
But college will improve your critical thinking and writing skills.
This will enable you to post messages that are coherent and communicate more effectively with others.
I love this lady and what she and her husband are doing to encourage young people to be motivated for public service. Thank you Michelle.
What about all the young black youth dying on the streets of your beloved Chicago?? Any thoughts on how to stop all the violence there??
I am a nursing student at age 37 and the dedication from both of you for promoting education in America was one of my driving forces to get to school and make a better life for myself and my son.  My son now knows that an education is worth the work you put in thank you!!
You'll always be our first lady! We miss you!
LMAO
We  will be there #CollegeSigningDay #ReachHigher
Can your next stop be Florida State?! @floridastate Oh, and can you bring @JoeBiden with you?
We miss you both
Wish i was one of the privileged women who were able to see and meet you today while you were here #MO’Bama #Boston
You are missed dearly 
Tune into YES Prep Public Schools @YESPrep Senior Signing Day on May 29th!! @MichelleObama 
I can't wait to celebrate when you become our first Black female President. You and family inspire all of us. We love and miss all of you.
We miss you and @BarackObama so much 
Can I come just to see @MichelleObama ?!
Missing you both!
@jamesgiammetta i love michelle obama look how hot she is
We desperately need more scientists, engineers, environmentaliat, economists, etc. ..
Señora, nuestro respeto y admiración desde México, para usted y su esposo. Dejaron un hueco muy grande que se ha llenado desafortunadamente, con incomprensión, grosería e injusticia.
You are a breath of,fresh air. No words for how much you both are missed.
I wish we could have @MichelleObama and @BarackObama at our Spring signing Day. That would be awesome. @HHSCoyotes will shine!!
And thank you for continuing to use the power of your voice for the betterment of children. My very favorite First Lady (emphasis on the lady!).
I'm so in awe of college-bound students all over the country—you inspire @BarackObama and me every day. We know how hard you’ve worked to make your college dreams a reality. That’s why #CollegeSigningDay is one of my favorite traditions. TYPE BEAT
Professor Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76, his family confirmed. TYPE BEAT 
Miss you both so much, Michelle 2020? Pleaseeee
I miss ya'll!! 
Miss you and President Obama!
When can we get you out to @CollegeBoundInc ? We are still graduating % of our students from high school and maintain a % college acceptance rate. #yearofzaire #MentoringMatters
Thus is one of the reasons that you and the “president” Obama are so loved by our country.  Thank you
#Education is the answer... A key part of it. Keeping people ignorate perpetuates harm.
Your husband was all about our 1st lady. 

For once.
In the Name of Jesus Christ I bind you from HARMING another child on this earth ever again.  You will not win loser satan 
How's that royal wedding invitation working out for you? Heh, heh, heh...
This is sad that Michelle Obama, in this day and age, still sees people ONLY BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN!  What a genuine racist!!!

I'm so in awe of YOU and Barack....miss you every day....yes. the kids are awesome, aren't they?
Soo glad you 2 not involved with decisions about America anymore .. sit back watch how a real man works and holds people accountable for crossing the red line .. such a weak prez .. thank god u r gone .. TRUMP is a real man .. not someone who panders to bottom class peeps ..
The College scam.
monkey
Believe it or not, my announcement of your coming to Phila for College Signing Day brought in Two more seniors to apply to college who had been sitting on the sidelines! Good work, good partners- @MichelleObama and @PhillySCU !
Which is it? We don’t forget honey.
Government is not our parent, and taxpayers are not children...

If anything you have this backwards, since we pay the bills. Taxpayers are the parent, and government is the child, who's misbehaved...

You've been given a life-long time out. Now go to your room!
A good parent doesn't pay our enemy $1.7B while they keep chanting "Death To America and Israel", oy vey.
Please remind us again what s great parent
But....Barack is of a different temperament than Trump.... but.....you can’t deny that his children and grandchildren “Love Him”  even the people he “Fires”.....he was part of the entertainment industry....that “ Brainwashed” most of us.... !
Thank you for supporting first generation college students! We hope there might be room for a few #CollegeBoundCamden seniors to join the #signingday celebration!
God bless her Excellency Michelle Obama and all 
@LindseyScorey IS A HUGE FAN
Mark your calendars! Get ready to celebrate our 5th College Signing Day with @MichelleObama on May 2 in Philadelphia!

Wonder what happened to Michelle Obama's parenting skills when she allowed her oldest daughter to intern for Harvey Weinstein.

 …https://diamondandsilkinc.americanewscentral.com/2018/04/06/bitter-michelle-obama-mocks-trump-takes-despicable-shot-americans/ …
You both are such a disgrace to the USA.  You have no shame and soon your true faces will be shown to the American public.  And Michelle people lie to you everyday.  You are really fat and your face is well to be kind distorted grotesquely.
I thank the the Dems favorite Muslim Family for leaving the White House a mess. Isis, North Korea, Daca, Obama Care Bust, Ilegally unmasking US Citizens, IRS Scandal, MS-13, 20 Trillion in Debt, ignoring the Vets, I can go on and on. Good Job ObombA’s. Go back to the Ghetto!!
Barack and Michelle: It is Literally. Painful. to Follow. What you are doing now and to revisit your 8 years in the White House. We will rise again, but have fallen so far in just a year. #STILLnotReady
We miss you both more than you know... and now, even worse, to have you replaced by the antichrist himself, a double suffrage
Eat carrots  give me a break your smuck of a husband is a joke plz take that nonsense elsewhere. Thank god for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump realDonaldTrump
Really? Wow!
