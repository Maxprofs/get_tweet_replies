******** MALALA LIVES! ***** HAPPY BIRTHDAY Malala, The Miracle Soul! ********
One tough cookie. My what a lady she is. Grew up pretty quick after that and they still probably have a price on her pretty head. Bravery.
It's so inspiring!  
How many girls like her did your husband kill with his drone strikes?
Happy Earth Day
First Lady, you are a class-act. We miss your grace, your compassion, your self-respect. We miss you guys
We love and miss you and your husbands class and diplomacy dearly. Happy Birthday @Malala 
Nobody misses any of the Obamas. Get real
I do. And he left with a higher approval rating than that fraction of a man trump will ever receive!!
That's so true Thank you and God Bless you
You are a true icon for all the people around the world.Your beavely drives us to take new challenges without any shred of doubt. 
#HBD.
Michelle and Malala, women like you make the world better. Your humanity, strength, class and perseverance are inspiring. Thank you.
I m sorry but it's not the courage, wanna see the courage then see the children of #APSPeshawar
It's a sht thing to compare tragedies.
She is coward and left the country while others are real fighters and stay in pakistan to defeat terror and continue study !
She should have stayed so she could have been shot in the head a second time?
Where’s your support for us Americans? Oh wait you never had any
