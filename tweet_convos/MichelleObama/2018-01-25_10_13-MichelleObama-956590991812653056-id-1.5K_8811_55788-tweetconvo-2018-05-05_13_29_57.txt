You are so right.  We need you to run for President!
Even in (temporary? ) retirement, our last First Lady, continues to “Go High”! 

good,holly Michell Obama
While You & BARACK OBAMA MAY$, attended The HARVARD UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL back in 1993! During Our PRESIDENTIAL STING UPDATE MEETING with
No one cares about you. it is now Melania Trump time
What has Melania done as first lady? Michelle Obama promised she would continue what she started and she's doing exactly that. Melania has done nothing.
she's been fighting depression and humiliation from being married and disrespected by her man
Why is she staying with him?
fear of deportation 
Then HONORABLE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SR.! You & BARACK, had a Live SATELLITE FEED to Our meeting! Because of You having been my VIRGIN, back
You are such an inspiration to us Michelle  Especially when our country needs something to be inspired about. Love President Obama and your great leadership Of what USA SHOULD BE

BTW there hotshot.... noticed you used God in your reply, you do know that the Dem party booed God in their convention better make up your mind
I'm not a dem. I am an independent who refuses to put party over people like dems did Bernie and Republicans do everyone but the rich. And stop making up stuff. Just like a Republican throw it against the wall hoping it sticks. Elevate your thinking to involve a warmer heart.
So you are an independent.... tell me how many non democrats you have voted for, names and dates
Not going into all that with people who don't know how to debate without the hate. We have been voting for the lesser of evils since I could vote the only vote I cast that I'm totally proud of  is Barack, Joe, and Bernie. It's not about party it's about what's best for all of us.
Ok Richard Ill go down that road, what was black unemployment under Obama and what is it now? Joe Biden or crazy uncle Bernie come on Richard you have got to be smarter than that
Obama is a treasonous Socialist thug POS.

Le Congo c'est un pays de merde avec celui qui est à la tête.
I miss you, Michelle Obama!
Awesome!
Great
Can somebody see the current FLOTUS doing this in the future (even just for publicity?)
Education is such an important part of building great communities and a country! It should be one of the most important focuses of our government!
Education So Important to are county wish the government COULD SEE THAT!!
As world Citizen, I'm proud to notice how some leaders honour these real social and educative actors. These people give value to next generation and that's the way to educate our youth. Thank you Madame for you involvement.
Brings tears to my eyes.  You should run!!!!
Miracle workers.
I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU. DECENCY HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY  WE ARE HOPELESS.
Yes @MichelleObama #EducatedGirlsRock #ReachHigher
Please Run for Office, we need the Obama’s in Office!

This is why we LOVE you Michelle...you are a wonderful human being. God Bless you.
Congratulations!  Our gratitude to all school and community counselors as well as school social workers who provide mental health support to our nation!
I miss one of the best first ladies in history! :(
Awesome.  
You are the BEST @MichelleObama 
Education is everything to our young..love your tweet!
When you see the good that comes from things like this you wonder why it’s so hard to reproduce.
It's important to have nig dreams and to dream big. Some dreams might come true. I'm poor, very poor, but I dream big. It keeps me going....and some dream might come true. I might get butter on my bread....I really might
...to have BIG dreams....(sorry my fingers)
This is what a great First Lady cares about instead of what outfit she’s gonna wear next!
Or some dubious bullying campaign.
Too bad our government doesnt care enough about its citizens to ensure that we all can get a free quality college education. No they'd rather use our tax dollars to bail out crooked bankers.
I really think you should learn proper English since you're going to be living in this country's prisons what you and your stupid husband did #worstpresidenteverObama
Well said First Lady! 

You are truly a class act who holds genuine interest in our children and their future. Shows a deep.appreciation of school faculty members and what they do to expand the minds of our youth. My best to Mr. President Obama.  :)

Locked up? B.... you must be on hemorrhoids lol.
It’s also because of you and Mr. Obama. 
Awesome
Thank you for being you!
#CleanHouse and get the leftist, #Marxist, #Communist out of our education institution's.
Class act
Congratulations Kristen Perry!

Please come back! Pretty please!! This is going to sound like a needy ex but we NEED you in our lives 
Michelle Obama. The best..
School counselors are one of the most important, unheralded, and underpaid jobs in the country especially given the difficulty of finding quality mental health clinicians who work with children and also accept insurance.
Wonderful! God bless our teachers! Thank you Mrs. Obama for continuing your good work and for continuing to be a beacon of light always.
Because of women like you my kid comes home for school starving!! Go AWAY

Love you Michelle Obama
Ily Michelle 
The Obamas: so classy

and then we have Trump supporters, who seem to crawl out of a rock (video)
Been thinking about this video for weeks—I feel like its amazingness was undervalued at the time? Its so spectacular 
Totally inspiring! Thank you for sharing @MichelleObama and inspiring even adults to #ReachHigher . It's never too late! 
My First Lady! I’m so glad to hear from you. You and your beautiful family are missed. Someday I hope to shake you hand and thank you in person.
