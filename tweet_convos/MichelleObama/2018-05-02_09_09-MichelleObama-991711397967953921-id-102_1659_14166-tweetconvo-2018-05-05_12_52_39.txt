A great First Lady !!!
I know you are me, and if I can be standing here as your forever First Lady, then you can do anything you put your mind to." And BO said the word "I" 64 times in a 20 minute speech 4 years ago. "Forever" and "I "go together well as they show excessive pride in one self.
So dope!! #AggiePride
