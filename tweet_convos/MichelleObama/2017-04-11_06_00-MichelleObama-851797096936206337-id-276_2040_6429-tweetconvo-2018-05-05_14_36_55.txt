My name is mohamed ahmed im IT technitian i need educational and other oppurtunity please can u invite to me in you country Usa right
We miss you Michelle!
"WE"..Speak for yourself
You weren't included in the"we". So take your nastiness, somewhere else. I don't care.
Just truth..something you snowflakes can't handle without melting I know...
Fake Race Bait... Division
You will forever be missed... But can anyone see the contrast in the two first ladies.... Education will always outclass anything else.
It's not just education. Michelle Obama is intelligent. No amount of education would ever make Melania her equal.
You're right. Michelle only speaks English & has to diet like crazy to be a size 16 and load up on make up to look like a woman.
pleasure  make  happy   so mazing   today  right  here
Good
BLESS ME NOW MEN ARE KICKING ME OUT OK
What happen to the world? We need more Obama, we need more future.
Love u mom
@YeomanSmith2017 you are the best  I miss you too much

It was a honor to be Mrs Michelle Obama today at my kids school, talking about her life and legacy for the women in history day...
I see you still have disgusting taste in clothes...Some things never change...
Michelle has a classy taste in clothes.
Unlike Melanie Trump
Sooo nice #CollegeSigningDay
TRUMP WILL BRING BACK AMERICA.
Get out of Washington.  Nobody cares what you have to say.  Disgusted with you and your husband. 8 years of nothing.
You aren't first lady and you and your husband failed our COUNTRY. SHAME.
14 people following must tell you something.  Obama worst president ever. Thank God you are out of the White House.
#C4C President Trump just sent a bill to Michelle Obama for the Obama's lavish lifestyle.
@MichelleObama can you come back!!
I miss you and and the outstanding job you did as First Lady. It bothers me that the current First Lady is so absent from her duties
Sorry I'm new at this but I'm trying to find direction, advice,help whatever so that my daughter can go to college this fall
Too bad Malian won't be tweeting any 'college gear' photos!
Is a trade school ok?
