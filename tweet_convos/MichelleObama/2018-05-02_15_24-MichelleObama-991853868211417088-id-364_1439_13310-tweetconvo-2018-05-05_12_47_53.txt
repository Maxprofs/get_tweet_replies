Ppl don't need college, the debt or brainwashing. They need politicians who get their tax money to spend their tax money on the citizens. Not illegals. They need rich liberals to house illegals & refugees if you like them so much

Ty! Hasn't been easy, going to undergrad 25 yrs after every1 told me I could never, graduating manga cum loude & a mo. later, grad school. Straight A's (1 B+ while I dealt w/ PTSD symptoms).  Now I'm 45 & trying to follow my passion, the arts, but it doesn't come easy at this age

Take an online class or two that you can manage on your own time. To keep you focused on something that is about your amazing future to be. Good luck!!
Great advice.

#CollegeDecisionDay #BetterMakeRoom 
Going to Arizona State University in Phoenix!!! Gonna be a film director, gonna make a Hamilton movie, just you wait! If that don't work, I'll run for president 
College is such a necessity but I also think it's important that we discuss and teach finances to prospective students. It's guaranteed you will graduate with some sort of debt and SO many kids don't truly understand what they are getting themselves into financially!
I'm 35 and going back to school (in Paris) to get a Master's Degree in translation.
I've already translated Hamilton in French and I'm quite proud of it.
#BetterMakeRoom #CollegeSigningDay
Nowhere near America but I got accepted to USTP here in Philippines, BS. Architecture!!!~ #CollegeSigningDay #BetterMakeRoom
Excited to say I’m going to Kent State to get my degrees in Music and Political Science! (btw check out my grad cap cover I’m very proud of it)
College is no silver bullet. I graduated four years ago with a B.A. and still haven't found a decent job in a related field.
My daughter (not on social media) will be going to Colorado School of Mines to study mechanical engineering and to be part of the coolest marching band that wears hard hats!

I’d love to get to Princeton, but anywhere I can get the most scholarships to would be smartest.
Look at the smiling faces of the college-bound Class of 2018 fr WOrangeHS in WO, NJ representing @woschools @MrMooreWO their principal, & all those who loved & taught them #CollegeSigningDay #wo2world #wotweechers #loveisloveislove
Your alma mater is getting one of the best wrestlers in the state of Texas, and one of our school’s most loved servant leaders! Our loss is @wesleyan_u ‘s gain.
Not yet, but in two years I'm (hopefully) hitting up LSMT, or Mountview in London. Right now I'm starting to gather ideas and doing research on how on earth I'm going to afford it, but mark my words, I'll do it, and this video is my motivation. Wait for me in the wings.
#NESCACRepresent
Although F&M wasn't my first choice; it was my best choice! Nearly all merit based scholarships, great friends, excellent opportunities to work with professors...and I met my wife to whom I will be married 15 years this June. Thanks @FandMCollege !!

have had my heart decided on the university of edinburgh since i was young BUT ive booked open days to four other universities in scotland!! i really hope i can do history + politics since they're my fave subjects (history is bc of you!)
Georgetown changed my life!
I'm pretty sure going to @NYUTischFilmTV @NYUTischSchool ruined my life.  Like, seriously, all the drug dealers have sweet careers... one even works at Tesla.  Dude took 8 years for undergrad to sell drugs and coast.. granted he would have graduated in 2007 so, like, times change
#CollegeSigningDay #BetterMakeRoom I signed to Cal State San Marcos last year and I am studying music! I want to become a choir teacher and spread the power of music to as many students as I can!

You’re both an inspiration to so many. Lin - my son and I saw you perform ‘In The Heights’ in NYC when he was a teenager while on holiday from the UK and the power of your performance stayed with him. Michelle - you are plain and simple ... a blessing. God bless you both 
I'm a little old to go to school now, but I always dreamed of somewhere in the city: NYU, The New School. Not fancy enough for Columbia or Juilliard; had to keep those dreams in check. But I'm old now and poor, just cheering the kids on. May they achieve the things I never did.
Thank you SO much for being the positive empowering voice in my feed. I relaxed my shoulders down & breathed deep today!  I have a very aggressive type A teenager & a friend who works for Stanford admissions. She shared this great story https://www.facebook.com/hyoonwu/posts/10156285447148698 …

so excited to be going to kalamazoo college for political science in the fall!! can't wait to be in such a welcoming and socially active environment 
It upsets me when smart people such as yourself glorify the higher education system in its current state. It is a racket. I’m all for college, university, and continued education, but only if it’s free. Free!!
It’s been many years since I went to college. Now it’s my son’s turn...he was accepted and is going to Stetson for music. He’s so excited and so is his Momma! #CollegeSigningDay #BetterMakeRoom
