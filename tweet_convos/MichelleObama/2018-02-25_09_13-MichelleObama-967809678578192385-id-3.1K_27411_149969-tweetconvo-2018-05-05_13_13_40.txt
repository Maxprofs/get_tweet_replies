I can‚Äôt wait to read this! #BookClubDivasThisIsMust
Living 25 years in this country from South America and you are my favorite first lady, your story is not just inspiring but you show 8 years of class, elegance, respect, diplomacy and intelligence. And I'm not planing to attack Melania because I think that she is just a victim
oh, boy!!
You have done so much Michelle. I hope more young people take you to heart....you are a great inspiration!
As some who is currently #writing my Next Crime #Novel being inspired was something that happened to myself.
Congratulations to you on you book!
Why did you tell such lies on Ellen about how awkward it was to receive a gift from our beautiful first lady when you done the same to Larua Bush, was it because you was intimidated by her. Your classless.
Can‚Äôt wait to read it and learn .. love you

Stoked for a good read 
Should be in the bargain bin in no time.
Can't wait
We can't wait to read it! Thank you for sharing your story. We're certain you will inspire so many of our young readers...
I hope that you actually tell how you lied to the American people, how you used the American taxpayers and your honest opinion about your hate for the white man.  You and your so-called husband did everything in your power to racially divide this country.
Thank you very much! Our Queen!!!!!!
Can‚Äôt wait to read it!
I can't wait to also assign it to my students in my English classes @sdmesacollege to read!

Keep holding on to the narrative you sooooo desperately want to be true.

Otherwise yoy‚Äôll have to burn your MAGA hat and delete all the pro-crook posts you have on your facebook account.

You‚Äôve been fooled- better to do it now before it‚Äôs too late.
