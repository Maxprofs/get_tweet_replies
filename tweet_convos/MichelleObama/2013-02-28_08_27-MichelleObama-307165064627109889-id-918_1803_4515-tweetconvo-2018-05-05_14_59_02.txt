@meandmyhackers1 @MichelleObama hahaha!!! Neck boulders!!!
@Configa @MichelleObama with a name like barack he's working in a quary. Limestone clogs those razor bumps.
@meandmyhackers1 @MichelleObama You can see them from space lol
@Configa @MichelleObama I thought you meant the boobs. Maybe as ocean flotation devices. Rocks sink hun.
@meandmyhackers1 @MichelleObama haha!!! Well you can see The Great Wall of China from space - and his razor bumps are big like that lol
@MichelleObama Who died & left YOU in charge of our country's choices 2 eat? Mind YOUR OWN plate! Quit meddling in everybody's lives & get 1
@Ecko_Duskael Maybe she should start sending public figures crazy messages like you. Is that what you mean by getting a life?
@raininblack Maybe you like some1 else making simple choices 4 you in life; YOUR CHOICE. Her stupid prog only raised grocery prices & taxes!
@Ecko_Duskael Okay, crazy pants.
@raininblack How UN-politically incorrect & sad; name-calling. Oh well, GOD loves you anyway :)
@Ecko_Duskael Your magical vengeful SkyGod isn't real but thanks anyway.
@raininblack Ur welcome. He is real, He is alive and all around us and you. Don't be afraid. Talk to Him like you are to me. He's waiting...
@Ecko_Duskael Is he the one who makes you so hateful? I think I'm better off without your imaginary friend. 
@MichelleObama Don't we parents have the right to know whether we're feeding our kids GMO foods?
@MZarocostas @MichelleObama  exactly! Label or ban GMOs and fight Monsanto!
@MichelleObama GMO free foods, I presume? As in, totally in contradiction to your husband signing the Monsanto Protection Act?
@darrenrobinson @MichelleObama  Exactly! Get Monsanto out of bed with the FDA
.@Travelcase @darrenrobinson if @MichelleObama knows everything about healthy foods surely she knows something about healthy religion?
@WiseBanyanTree Healthy religion? Sounds like a contradiction to me.
.@darrenrobinson Ha Ha. But but but there's got to be opposites of everything. Law of Polarity. Good/Bad, Day/Night.
This is I am attempting to start the WildRoseOrganics farm. Big agriculture breeds synergy in big business. Thank you @MichelleObama

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE LOVE GARDEN YOU STARTED AT YOUR WHITE HOUSE IM SURE CLOWN TRUMP WILL HAVE IT DESTROYED
Healthier food option is stay away from anything sugar. Even “fat free” has the same amount as regular.
BEST.
yes if we could only afford the healthy choices!
I would just go about alkaline-forming foods that also have fat to help the brain; no wonder juice and pop don't work.
My high school sr has been fighting anorexia for 2yrs. Having items like chicken tenders/fries avail to her would've helped 
GMO food are not healthy for anyone. You and that despicable husband of yours has destroyed our food! Go away!
saw a picture of u in NY devouring a sandwich, practice what you preach, little bites!  Did not look like a healthy choice
being a small business owner... healthy is a good thing!
they're better 4 healthcare, better 4 economy, better 4 the military that has fitness & fat camp for many kids b4 boot
Why they should be healthy is a no brainer- sad so many seem to not understand that.
#freedryork2017
@MichelleObama  then why is the White House and our country being controlled by evil Monsanto? GMO's should be illegal as well.  Do more

because she is black. You took it back from the educated black family and gave it to a demented white guy.
She is a Princeton University graduate with a doctorate...Did you even get your GED???
So we are angry that a black lady can get off her butt and work hard for an education.
judging by the size of your dress with Ophra you need to eat some veggies stop preaching what my kid eats ur kids smoke dope
If you are going to be insulting at least spell the name correct. It's 'Oprah'.#DopeheadsloveTrump

So the government can pay high price for food the children won't eat just like dozens of other things ur husband did
Ms.Obama why can't the government provide educational opportunities and put in place hydroponic gardens
please encourage families to eat organic foods without pesticides, synthetics, antibiotics or growth hormones

we have to turn back the clock and get off processed foods and go back to the way it was healing with God's food veggies
Then tell your husband to stop cutting our money n raising prices so we can afford 2 eat healthier.  While u r @ it stop starving our kids
why back to 2013
