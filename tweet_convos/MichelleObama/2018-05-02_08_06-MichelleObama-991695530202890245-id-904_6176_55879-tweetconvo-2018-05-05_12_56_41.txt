Sure thing donnie. THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO FIRE A CHAPLAIN?! AWW, THAT GOOD MAN DIDN'T BOW TO THE WANNA BE KING, DICTATOR? GOD IS WATCHING YOU BUD, BTW, in the USA, we have the freedom to believe in the God, Higher intelligence, or not. I believe,God& science both. You, $$!
Actually that was Paul Ryan who had the Chaplain fired, not Trump. And he fired him after the guy made a prayer that everybody in America should benefit from the tax plan.
GUESS that means you are either asleep, definitely love d.t., LISTEN TO FOX NEWS, WORSHIP MONEY, HANNITY, DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAW, CONSTITUTION ACTUALLY ARE, I SUGGEST YOU READ, LEARN, LIVE AND DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. NOT A MATTER OF LEFT OR RIGHT, JUSTICE FOR ALL. OK?
Uh, I don’t support Trump. I’m a Democrat actually and believe that everybody should be held accountable. I was just pointing out a mistake in your tweet earlier so other people can’t use it against you in the future.
Thank you for all that you continue to do for our country and it’s kids. They are our future and you and Barack are our very best role models

Most of us are trying to ascend, while trump is infatuated with descending.
Right. And dragging us with him. The way we fight back is voting. Every 2 yrs is a must.
Always!
We miss your family.  Keep your uplifting tweets coming girlfriend, we need your positive messages! 
We don’t miss anything about you and your family
Never forget In the period of Obama

The Genocidal destruction of Libya in 2011 UK and USA
Why are you on this thread...?
Why are YOU on this thread...?
President Obama, I saw that one explanation for the better employment numbers for African-Americans is that more African-Americans stayed in school while you and Michelle were in the White House.:) That’s something that can’t be rolled back.:)


This Black woman left the democrat slave plantation & is on the #TrumpTrain #Ukraine 
Black Votes Matter 
I think one thing can be said with a certainty. Education is something we need more of in America.
Thank you for supporting an initiative that matters.

If you need my service I will join your team. I'm graduating June 1st MSc. MIS
@BarackObama yes you right
Welcome to Philly @MichelleObama!!!
and debt....yaaay
A leader of our nation works hard to pressure evil regimes. Something your husband didn't do. He never even bothered with Otto Warmbier and now he is dead. So unlike the your husband, North Korea releases all U.S. detainees. What a difference a real leader makes!
Lord if I never seen her vile husband, or her again. It would be to soon. Where is the spits in disgust emoji!
Are you more excited at the plan very carefully executed plan I must say to start World War III and have ordinary Americans executed by weapons of mass destruction that y’all helped the Middle East make? There’s no safe places for the ordinary Americans just the elite!
Never forget 

The Genocidal destruction of Libya in 2011 UK and USA

Thank you for supporting higher education.  You are missed
You're welcome
Where I u Michelle
If only @BarackObama spent that 1.5 billion of taxpayer dollars he gave to Iran without congressional approval to develop nuclear weapons, to the education system instead offering these African American Americans scholarships.
Deep state unraveling. Lawyer up!! What a disgrace. Political spying, illegal wiretapping, using the F.B.I. to aid Hillary. 
#MAGA.
Education is available, but it is not implemented. Lack of imagination, visionaries. Rate of growth decline. Somehow I can solve one puzzle daily, but I am not used. 3rd World.
THE LAND IS FOR ISRAEL; THE QURAN AGREES.

I don't believe in the Quran; simply helping Muslims to realise that; according to their Quran; the land is for Israel.

Reference: Quran 5:20-21; 17:104

Psalm 122:6
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
