@MichelleObama
Teachers are notorious for forcing their personal views on students. A higher education should teach us how to think not what to think.
Make room for more left wing racist
Mrs Obama could you consider helping @GDouglasJones win Sessions seat in the Senate https://youtu.be/0ngPEIAXd5Q

Cheers and thanks for the inspiring words of wisdom on higher education. Greetings from Kenya
Michelle, many with higher educations are still very poor.  What is that all about?miss you and Barack.
"Better"? How about "Please make room".   Very angry. Try sugar and salt
Right!
Great inspiration!

And let's make higher ed more affordable and a place of belonging for all.
YES AND DARE TO DREAM.  THE AMERICAN DREAM, A CONSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RIGHT.
I support
@MichelleObama keep pedaling college to the youth. More amusing than dictating what the kids eat.
@KELLYROWLAND yeah that's if you can shower daily, and eat daily. It is a miracle I got through 2 semesters. #Godshere
Owesome Michelle Obama. Inspiring for my girls!
: Stay focused. Stay determined. Work hard. You can accomplish anything with a higher education.
Now let me keep it in my mind in each struggle
And my ancestors proved that you can accomplish anything without it.
No way GET OUTTA HERE
Also remember a higher education does not mean a 4 year degree. A trade qualification is just as valuable #dowhatyoulove #college
@LanaParrilla I'm so proud of you for working to help encourage each one of us to get an education. 
Sure it would be great if we all had the money to do that
If you can't get Pell Grants, there's always taking 1 or 2 classes at a time- in the classroom or online.
@MichelleObama Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but we are powerful beyond or deepest dreams @MichelleObama.
Let's hope the next generation has that chance with the way devous is handling omit education system
Education without jobs is meaningless. The economy has to support graduates. I have 2 degrees. Unemployed for over 10 years.
What a wonderful and powerful message!!
Thank you so much ,I m determined to work hard for better our Future .God bless you.

Thanks you for being so inspirational. We sorely lack that now with this administration 
Yeah, it's a crying shame when educated people don't have a damn clue!!!  
Something is lacking in this country. It's sad to see all this anger n it's been getting worse. trump isn't helping. He's inciting
Meanwhile, *nothing* is getting done 4  or it's people!!!  What a total waste!!!
