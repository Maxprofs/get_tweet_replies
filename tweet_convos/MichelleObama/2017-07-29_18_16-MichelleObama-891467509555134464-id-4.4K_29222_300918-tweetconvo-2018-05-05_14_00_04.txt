I'm seeing people miss her. What are y'all missing? I'm just curious #therapymixtape
Uhh she's super smart, she has never posed nude, she's not a third wife, she's actually happily married and lives with her husband?
Apart from all that, she fulfilled more than her duties, she's passionate about what she believes in, works to achieve set goals.
Agreed. My tweet was just the tip of the iceberg. Couldn't include all her accomplishments in 140 characters
Mine is just below your tip. Still isn't enough, yes, never will be in 140 characters.
Or only say 'fake news'.
You are missed. Your family is missed. Class in the oval office is missed.
Come again? 
Of course, You're absolutely entitled to your own opinion. It's just that you lost me at "honesty" & "innocent" is all.  Sweet dreams.
Of course you would you little snowflake. 
Well, that escalated quickly  I didn't understand her message either
I was so confused. Lol.
Happy Birthday Mrs. Robinson!
Wow! What a beautiful lady.
Happy Birthday to your mom...

Happy birthday Mrs. Robinson.  Miss y'all in the White House.
As somebody said that love can be taught,  so we can think that parents are the best teachers for that. Let's go on on with our children!
I'm sure she talks about white people behind there backs like most of the AA's do, there super nice to your face but.... racist at the core
Wow looks like Michele and Sasha
Belated happy birthday
