Bummer dude.  I think maybe you should consult Harry Reid on rule breaking.  What goes around comes around!
The rules don't matter any more. How long before Constitution is irrelevant?
@SenSchumer The confirmation process is taking too long. Anything to speed it up is warranted.
SUCH as? I figured, U don't know..just like Soros' paid protestors have NO clue what or why they are protesting
@SenSchumer You are sooo smart and you tweet a lot. Put out something useful to inform all us uninformed people.
@PattyMurray do you're job  or resign ! Quit obstructing
Obstruct GOPS - KOCHS 100%.
Dems have to challenge GOPS and play by their rules - DIRTY. NO to support any supreme court pick.
You expect Republicans to follow the rules..their treatment of Garland is evidence enough..you need to get real!
you have known the nominees for almost 2 months. Get to work.what are we paying you to do?
Please fight against all his nominees, as well as the new one (Supreme Court). Thank you.
8-year-olds play Monopoly. Upend the game board. Disgraceful.
Good
liberals are hoot when they lose power,put up with 8yrs of Obama & never protested,busy working to pay for all
@SenSchumer you guys set the tone. Now if only you had the numbers.
Still trying to keep the heat off yourselves. The corruption Soros gravy train is over for you traitors
we have to stop this disease before we're all dead! Plan b, talk with coastal states abt secession we are brains&muscle
fine but leave Eastern WA out of it. We've wanted to become the state of Lincoln for years.
probably eastern oregon too, but for sure the population/science/industry side!
-cool. I like nontech and growing organic and farming-no hassles of city life.
Please cross the aisle to share these concerns with your GOP colleagues. Ethics matter. Praying for you. Thx 4 all u do.
- they are all selling their souls.
#hypocrites #goingsouth
If Dem would have showed up to ask questions instead of boycott committee meetings
@debbiemillman rules don't matter
@SenSchumer y r u obstructing Government at every step if the way?
@SenSchumer B/c they are not above cheating & rule bending & have proven this frightening point.
is this because they fear what else is coming down the road and trying to get their people in place now?
this sounds like one of the "shock moments" historians have been warning us about.
@PattyMurray have you really thought thru your partisan obstructionism? Look at what is happening in Berkely right now!
@SenSchumer that is terrible for what the Damn Republican do the dirty tricks!! Why they went ahead cuz fear of POTUS??????
take the new information and the fight to the floor vote. First delay by withholding unan consent so more info can get out
worked too waaaaaaaa
you're refusal to participate and inform your constitutes is childish and appalling. No leadership=cities moving to vio.
@SenSchumer @SenatorCantwell well if you would do your job and vote yes no reason not too.  Go GOP
You Guys got outfoxed again. I am ashamed!   No vote for SCOUS nominee for 12 mo.Good for Repubs. why not Dems?
but what can you do? This no longer feels like a democracy. Dictatorship is a better term
Keep up the #Resistance just vote no. Use the republican playbook against them!
So WHAT are senate Dems going to DO about it? you have info that they perjured themselves; can you impeach them?
@PattyMurray  @SenateDems Forget this "concern" talk. Time to get in front of the media with consistency & hyperbole #ITMFA
@SenSchumer If @SenateDems refuse to participate there is no choice. Leaders don't run from problems. U wouldn't understand
@SenSchumer can you share those breaking concerns? No, you are stalling and you look foolish. America is watching. 2018
@SenSchumer   Resist!
I want Dems. at these Committee hearings- even if ur no vote doesn't win.as a tax payer I want 2 b represented.
@SenSchumer   So pathology power hungry. Keep fighting. You have our support
@SenSchumer at least they showed up for work.
@caseycarroll63 And Dems NEED BETTER PRESS STRATEGY! GOP will just paint it as response 2 "Dem obstructionism"! INFURIATING
@SenSchumer when u don't show up to do your job the business goes on without u when I don't show up I get fired
@SenSchumer go go GOP #draintheswamp #MAGA
This is so wrong! Confirms my belief that Repub's only care about $$$ & themselves. Very scary
@SenSchumer come on Senator.. they seem to always be a step ahead of you. You need to flank these republicans.
Stop being OBSTRUCTIONIST!
@SenSchumer Do something.
@SenSchumer IF EXTREME VETTING IS GOOD FOR REFUGEES ITS GOOD FOR NOMINEES! Bullshit Republicans change rules to accommodate
you guys are obstucting our political process #SoreLoosers #DoYourJob
@SenSchumer it's good to see somebody's doing their job and not just crying over spilled Hillary milk
This Obstruction By the DEMs will Leave Them with NO Seat at the Table
Sometimes you have to use the congress you have.
@SenSchumer this is so discouraging but please keep up the good fight for us
@SenSchumer Why did you leave the room like disagreeable children?
@SenSchumer resist. Vote no.
@SenSchumer 
@SenSchumer Our democracy is slipping away and there's seem to be nothing to do about it. I continue to pray!
@SenSchumer 
Why can't you guys see they AREN'T playing by ANY rules?
NO RULES - NO RULES - NO RULES
Please, catch up
and procedurals you can use to stop them up? There has to be a way to fight back as hard as they fought against for 8 yrs.
from out here, we aren't seeing or hearing a lot of fight from the "good guys" just..."they jammed us up".
well ok, that's what they've been doing for the last 8 years now. Where's battle plan? Lives are literally on the line.
we're out here marching by the millions, getting maced by police for peaceful assembly. We need more than mediocrity.
shows some fire. Show us some so some charisma and bombasity and guts. Lead with conviction.  Because we aren't seeing any.
I guess you and other (D)'s will show up next time.
@SenSchumer you guys boycotted.....dah.
@SenSchumer We the People deserve better!
@SenSchumer   Disgusting.
Confirming these senate panels are nothing but a show to them.
@SenSchumer Have you voted NO on every single nom? Then prepare to lose support next election. This is NOT normal.
Of course they did.
@SenSchumer Corruption at its best they are the most corrupt administration in the history of USA history what a disgrace
You mean law & order @SenOrrinHatch broke Senate rules to satisfy personal goals? Shocking. Nah.  Always been a hypocrite.
@SenSchumer   They only care about the rules when Dems are involved.  Fight!  We support you.
@twilight2000 noms are an inside trader and a perjurer, to boot
This means #resist. Republicans are not partners. They will change rules whenever they want.
@timthegoodone if they don't need Democrats at all, how much longer before Trump stop using the Senate it at all
@SenSchumer lol
Guess the motto is if you can't win the vote, cheat. Bad example for kids. Machiavellian.
The question is, what can we do to stop this?
@SenSchumer Rules?Really?From dictator democrats?this is political war. Prepare to be politically STOMPED!
It's clear now that our new fascist kleptocracy is cleverly disguised as the GOP! Fight on!!
Keep saying and sending postcards to http://Congress.You  will be voted out in 2018.
All you republicans in congress
and senate voted out in 2018. Thanks to Cantwell and Schumer
I am LIVID! Rules, laws, ethics  ALL don't matter. Republicans have decided only one party THEIRS! SHAME!

@SenSchumer Tough crap Chuck.This is political http://war.You  already changed rules.U need to be stomped politcaly
@SenSchumer 6 November 2018 the renewed senate republicans will have to live by those rules and will complain.
I give you the Republican Party!
#BannonsPuppet  #TinPotDictator
@SenSchumer Do you get it The Republicans Don't Care! Fight Fight Fight
You mean they finally got sick & tired of your obstructionism.
What are you and your colleagues going to do about it?
Despite you not showing up for work. Americans want a refund. No work, no pay. Lead, follow, or get out of the way @POTUS
The regressives don't really have any rules - their only rule is to do whatever it takes (playing dirty) to get their way.
hell, just vote Bannon supreme leader suspend Congress entirely.  Haven't done a damn thing for 8 years anyway #SeigHeil
thank the gop Nazi lovers for that
Senator Cantwell (D-Washington) Thank you for your concern/interest and this public statement.
#TaxReturns
Please stand strong. Do not cooperate.
yeah, you should've been there
Keep up the good work and stay strong. You have millions backing you.
can't we stop them?  How is this legal?
So no tax returns from the con men.
Maybe it is time to stop pulling punches -  work harder to stop this nonsense. Dems must stand tall & united!
no rules, no legitimacy.
Both Price and Mnuchin have very serious ethical concerns
They are #Unfit to lead their agencies
#BlockMnuchin
#BlockPrice
Senator, if it was really concerning you, you should have been in committee to voice that concern.
Filibuster, non-cooperation, non-violent #Resistance: here are some of the tools available to you. @SenatorCantwell @insonifier @SenateDems
What are you and the other Dems doing about it?
the exact same thing when the dems take back control.theb you get to sit there and take it.
If it was concerning, you or your colleagues should have showed up.
Good - you can't stop the freight train from rolling through, but you need to say later "I didn't help it"
this is where we need you the most Senator. Tell the GOP we are a nation of rules and laws!
It's so funny to watch the leftists pay attention now.
