@Keep_Protesting so shitty.. I have never seen anything so crazy as this trump storm in all my life.. God help us
Trump truly believes he is God.  He needs to be impeached and SOON. I'm ashamed to be an American today
he definitely has a God complex, and it's bs he hasn't been impeached already, conspiracy comes to mind :(
WHEN he is impeached, I will travel back to DC, pop the cork on some champagne & sing & dance in the streets
lol, take me with you hahaha:) I think we will all be singing & dancing in the streets lol.. whoop, whoop
I will happily meet you there and share my champagne and sing and dance loudly & proudly!  Woo hoo!
lol, sounds like a plan.. that would go down in history as the best party ever hahaha 
The Women's March on Washington was amazing & would be incredible to b there in celebration next time.
Scared for USA. Scared for WA. Scared for  family. Not of foriegn invaders. Our own government. This is where were headed?
I hate to say but because if the hypocrisy of the GOP and the White House corruption the US is Doomed!
@SenSchumer i work with disabled kids. This bill will be devastating - the #GOP has no heart.
no they don't
I sit here at 40, disabled, stuck in a wheelchair, left side paralyzed and this #asshat prez cares not.
it's very expensive for me to stay alive. multiple house payments to most, but he doesn't care.
Maybe people should try getting a job. People who want to work are. How many #Freeattle people do we have to pay for?
I want to know do you personally know people that are getting free services. like friends that you really know
One worked for us. She wanted her hours cut to continue getting money from DSHS & Fed handouts. SO YES
Did u ask her rationale?
Working 28hrs cut into her DSHS benefits. We offered full-time she didn't want to work that much. Kids 13,21
I had clients who would lose their daycare if salary increased. It was net lose for them.
@SenSchumer Thank you for standing up for Medicaid & ACA.  America has your back! We shall over come! #fixACA
American Genocide @SpeakerRyan
THESE CUTS WILL GO TO TOP 1% OF AMERICANS.  400 FAMILIES IN U.S. WILL GET THESE BREAKS..
@SenSchumer lol fear agents. all dems are right now is anti trump.
TOTAL lie. You know it. Just DNC scare tactics while the Washington Dems steal from grants for donors
Fucking Fillbuster them then. Play dirty like they did to Obama.
@SenSchumer More scar tactics by the Dems who fucked it up in the first place. #Grubered #Pelosied #failure
that's more bold.. watch what Bernie says be bold
#MAGA Sorry Chuckie, #Dem's you cannot give everything away, at some point you have to pay for it, socialism doesn't work
@DaShanneStokes #trumptrain - this means #medicaid $$ for you or your parents to go into nursing home will disappear.
Medicaid "as we know it" sucks.  Needs to be revamped and demos need to quit using that stupid phrase.
Maria, the people of Washington and other states are free to fund health care for the poor. Stop relying on fed funding!

@SenSchumer why not scream the liberal call to prayer? "People will die" or "its for the children "save the bullshit
@KimberlyEndico5  stop this from happening.
Have you tried to talk sense into @HerreraBeutler? We work together in the #PNW, right?
@SenSchumer - no matter what, govt should NEVER be involved in health insurance. It is not a right. One must work to have
.@SenatorCantwell @SenSchumer States are much better equipped to identify and supply the needs of their citizens. Must cut #WasteFraudAbuse!
@SenSchumer government wasn't designed to baby sit every person in America. Drain the swamp with you first!
@SenSchumer fake news!
@SenSchumer 
You guys got a pretty sweet deal and you gave it to yourselves and who pays for it,
 the middle class
We support your fight against this ridiculous tax break for the rich. They seem to being doing pretty well.
typical liberal. ..oh it benefits the rich...blah blah blah.
Love the way the left plays your jealousy
@SenSchumer Chuck you were not on the ACA you got your own sweet deal.
@SenSchumer 
Why don't all Americans get the same medical insurance that you do Chuck?
@SenSchumer but isn't ur 20 trillion debt already doing that?
@SenSchumer boy that must make you feel real good knowing that you have a chance to stop this madness but don't
please fight this Senator..... don't allow this to pass
@SenatorCantwell@S

Not true! You believe the government should provide everything.
.@SenatorCantwell Put in perspective- $4k max tax credit? Family premiums are $1500+/mo plus copay and deductible. Not good plan.
Defunds Planned Parenthood Clinics that provide crucial primary care services to women&children under Medicaid. #hypocrites
@SenSchumer 
Stupid  Liberals puts kids at risk. Remember Michelle Obama meal plan for schools. Starvation
@SenSchumer why don't you leave by paying first and we'll see who follows you
@SenSchumer for the poor needy and underprivileged, for the illegal aliens and illegal felons
@SenSchumer and all of the rich Democrats live on 10% of your income put the rest in the medical group
@SenSchumer it's obvious you're socialist so why don't you make a medical group
@SenSchumer and it's purpose is to force a single-payer system like Bernie's
@SenSchumer even the architect in the volunteer said that we've told her to stupid
@SenSchumer Obama care is the dying dinosaur designed to fail
socialism is not the solution, it is the problem.
@SenSchumer I'm n the ins business and that is a lie. But that is what libs and political hacks do.
so if we spend about $600 billion a year on medicaid how do you cut $880 billion?
@SenSchumer yes Representatives lie all the time, always have/always will. NO accountability for their fear mongering lies
@SenSchumer and thats what Dems are lying to you about. So sorry they are fear-mongering so many who dont get real news
@SenSchumer and puts  883 billion in tax dollars to the wealthy.
Love that the authors of this bill have never had a family member who relied on this program to survive.  Please attempt to make revisions
@SenSchumer people who have no insurance that seat care end up costing us all money. give them the insurance
@SenSchumer and it will result in higher premiums for the insured and higher medical charges to the general population
not to mention providing compassionate end-of-life care thru Hospice for those who don't qualify for Medicare
@SenSchumer please post a link supporting ur tweet
@SenSchumer Them why is Congress not required to buy via the exchange? HYPOCRISY that you have exempted yourself
Wow did you even READ the BILL. The COST ObamaCare is CRUSHING my family!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenSchumer that's what's wrong democratic's give away money they don't have make do with what they have be conservative
@SenSchumer @SenatorCantwell not true you are telling lies shame on you. You should be held to higher standards than a street thug.
@SenSchumer they don't pay crap anyway do awaywith them
@SenSchumer y'all give up your benefits to help pay for the less fortunate.  Our YOUR money where your mouth is.
@SenSchumer The medicaid supplements to my medicare assist with my medicines, my hospital stays and my insurance fees.
DO NOT LET TRUMPCARE PASS.
@SenSchumer But hey, tax cuts for rich people.
@jo_revelette , insane 
@SenSchumer vote no. Filibuster
This is why we MUST stop it. What are we to do with the disabled? Let them die?
A bit overly dramatic and alarmist Maria. Try reading the proposal and tweeting the truth!
@SenSchumer   Do what you all can to put this bill where it belongs.  In the Garbage....
@SenSchumer please continue to fight for those who are at most risk
@SenSchumer As my Senator, I'd like to see you get much more vocal about this travesty of an administration B4 it kills us!
@SenSchumer Yeah, but with military $ way up to build useless arms, GOP claims they are the patriots, as ppl die here.
Please keep fighting!
@SenSchumer it's up to the Republicans then to take care of the people and to make sure that that ACA does not go through
@SenSchumer Where's ur plan 2 reform the imploding Medicare program? Stop crying came up with sloutions.
@SenSchumer something needs to pay for his Florida trips!

@SenSchumer @SenCapito I know it will be devastating to my son and parents who are disabled and older I will be voting
This is on you! Work collaboratevly with POTUS to fix HC
@SenSchumer Fight on Senators ! The fate of the Republic is in your hands .
solution 2 this health care issue would be esaliy solved if congress’s benefits were attached 2 legislation
But it's better than they expected.  I mean how can you deny that?  #republicantrash
stay vigilant!
Resist! In solidarity from Shelton, WA! Thanks.
Don't let 'em do it, Maria! I have a close relative who would die in short order without Medicaid.
You are such a liar..no wonder voters don't trust you or professional politicians..
its called trump wealth care twc
do you have any republican friends you can talk some sense into?? It's not a dem/rep thing, it's an American Thing.
The ACA destroyed more people than it helped and its imploding.
.@SenatorCantwell I'm looking to you to continue to fight against this madness! Hey @PattyMurray this goes for you too. Keep it up!
thank you for standing up to this. #SaveACA
