Has Maria been on vacation the last 8 years?  No new ideas.  Just old lines with no action.
@PattyMurray 
Please keep up pressure to secure rights for students with disabilities!!!
@BetsyDeVos has a dangerous agenda
Can you explain why we already give $2.5 Billion a year to support illegal immigrants, but we need to "find" $4 Billion ...
...more to pay our teachers and educate our students? Why do Inslee, Murray, and you have your priorities backwards?
Shouldn't our teachers and children come before people who are here illegally?
i agree!!  So start by fighting like a Repub and boycott SOTU!!

yes! Those dimwits in our White House need to go!
I work in education and have for 29 years-you cant fix education when so kids have families in chaos-families need jobs
In our two party system what will the new party be called replacing the Democratic Party? The Democratic Party is dead now!
Great... you and President Trump can work on this...
Dems can & should work for economic and educational progress for all Americans; please endorse @keithellison for DNC Chair
Thank you Sen. Cantwell for standing up for public education, from a constituent with two kids at state university!
then you probably should start getting constructive with the new administration instead of obstructive. or just stay home.
pls. do what you can to make sure betsy devos does her job!
maybe we should start teaching Russian #DoSomething
Time to get out front and loud! They are going to give you a run for your money next election so grab the Mike and cameras!
Ur opposing DeVos was idiotic We now have  leader who will with charter & vouchers insure that happens blue puppet 2 unions
I wish to help get Congress realigned with less obstructionist Republicans. Please guide me as to what can be done.

ACA is a nightmare! My costs went from $350 to $650 per month... I can't afford it! The poor should go to County Hosp 4care
we could have had this if you cast your superdelegate vote for Bernie Sanders! This is YOUR FAULT!
This is what WA state is asking of you - thank you for holding the floor & doing your part!
Yes and maybe you should start with some of your Republican colleagues in the Senate!!!!  You are supposed to our leaders.
Really? How, with GOP control of Congress, Courts, & insane POTUS?? #resist & #obstruct

As a HS English teacher, WA citizen, and proud voter -Thank you for fighting DeVos and standing for education!

the best thing you could do for  schools  in get out of office. It's time for a change
.@SenatorCantwell please #HoldTheFloor ! do your Repub colleagues understand #HoldTheFloor is trending? Repubs & Dems alike do not want her!
School choice might be the answer!
Please help get the president removed from office.
I expected GeorgeWBush to demonize Putin! Why are Democrats demonizing Putin? Democrats will get no support from me4ColdWar
is the #americandream the TELEVANGELISTS GOSPEL OF PROSPERITY VS REAL CHRISTIANISM? @SenatorCantwell @suejohnston56
and what is the #americandream ? materialism? greed? me first and screw you ?@SenatorCantwell @suejohnston56
as long as you keep allowing the cost of ed to be out of control all u are doing is damaging the youth's dream
we can't have Betsy DeVos leading Ed.  She will destroy everything Ed and states have accomplished and she is a fraud.
I should say jobs we can get in to. Even entry level positions require 5 years of experience. It's frustrating.
Ma'am, it's no longer about education. It's about well paid, meaningful jobs. Education is everywhere. Jobs, not so much.
#VoteNoDevos

Whaye grade was your last year in public school ? Ms.Cantwell you are a hypocrite and should go to you gated home now.

Dark money is attempting to buy #DeVos a cabinet post! https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/02/06/20674/secret-money-fueling-pro-betsy-devos-ad-campaigns … via @Publici
Thank you for being my Senator!
Trump is incredibly dangerous. Incredibly dangerous! It’s obvious. He’s corrupt, he’s unstable, he’s reckless.
Then set up a system for parents to make more choices. Give us  a real Voice and choice in educating our children
Silence, egg.
Yes! That is why we MUST remove Washington's power over filtering the content our kid's can or cannot receive as 'correct.'
Send your kids to private school.
Why are you so against parents being able to educate their kids? #ParentsKnowBetterThanWashington
I'm not. They can choose to homeschool them if they want to do so.
Check your privilege, not all can, but can spare a couple hours a week to meet and discuss what happens at their local schools.
Thank you! It's time to #DumpDeVos and keep private corporations out of our classrooms. Our children deserve better!
Please ensure DeVos is not in charge. She is not qualified to lead Public Schools across this Nation.
