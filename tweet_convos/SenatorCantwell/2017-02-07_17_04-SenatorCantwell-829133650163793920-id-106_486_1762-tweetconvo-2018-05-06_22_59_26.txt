I'm a constituent & it is VERY important 2 me that you do all you can to obstruct confirmation of Jeff Sessions.
Thank you.

thank you!
Thank you for standing up!
.@SenatorCantwell YES! Keep up the obstruction!
Thank you!
Thank you Senator Cantwell!
oh get him back Maria, get him back
Thank you!
Bravo Sen Cantwell! 
Thank you!!!!
.@SenatorCantwell Thank you for your commitment to vote NO on Sessions. We're 100% with you!
thank you Senator.
Thank you senator!!!
Thank you from Seattle
Please work to advance America and not be a detriment.  The current administration should have Sen Sessions confirmed.
Thank you for voting NO on Sessions. We support you!
Thank you!!!
@Teddyshouse2II  the same way you supported the bigoted Clintons? Save the fake outrage.
and never did anything to stop the racist behavior against our President..NOTHING
Cantwell is a fake progressive.  Supports TPP.  Watch out, she's got #TISA behind her back.
Also voted against Bernie's drug reimportation from Canada bill too.
he is implicated in the FBI investigation into Russian hacking which he will be in a position to thwart
the Russian thing is all b.s. If anything Hillary was working with Putin.  yes that's true.
Democrats are no longer the opposition party-you have become anti-US fascists & lawbreakers.
You just described the GOP of the last 20+yrs. @SenatorCantwell & Dems are standing up for the majority who are decent Americans.
I see them on TV every night assaulting those decent Americans. Democrats are a party of hatred.
You are a traitor to this country. Take your hatred elsewhere.
Why are we paying $400k per day for security in Drumpf Tower? This is an outrage.  The WH is the home not this!
Thank you!!! This Washington state resident will remember.

As one of your constituents, I wanted to say THANK YOU! u r on the right side of history!! #Sessions
Thank you @SenatorCantwell.  #stopsessions
Thank you, Senator.
you are an obstructionist . Do what is best for USA.  you hate the people who voted for POTUS
doing what's best is just what she's doing. Sessions has an atrocious record
he does?

Thank you! Please, as a strong voice when you choose to use it, choose to use it now--make a lot of noise everywhere!
Unfortunately your my Senator and I need  yes vote from you on #Sessions. But let's face it. Dem's can't stop it anyway.
thank you again!!!
knock yourself out! He will be nominated, #snowflake
he will still be confirmed. #continueobstuction
your base is happy, now twist some Republican arms
Uh oh. Don't let @SenateMajLdr know. Sounds like your (rightfully) impugning a fellow Senator.
what universe do you live in?
we support you, we are behind you. Keep speaking up and out.
thank you - you do Washington state proud.
thank you!!
Thank you, Senator.
Thanks @SenatorCantwell for standing up for my rights as a woman & part of the LGBTQ community!
I will vote NO on #Sessions the same way he has voted NO on #womenrights, #LGBTQ rights, #civilrights, #immigration rights & #votingrights
Our @POTUS is not against LGBT or women's rights in any way. Take some time to research things.
By silencing Senator Warren, I feel like I have been personally silenced because she speaks for me
@_Drew_McCoy_ no such thing as women's rights, lgtbwhatever rights or immigration rights, etc so....
Thank you
Thank you Senator. You & @PattyMurray keep up the fight against this horrible swamp filled cabinet!
