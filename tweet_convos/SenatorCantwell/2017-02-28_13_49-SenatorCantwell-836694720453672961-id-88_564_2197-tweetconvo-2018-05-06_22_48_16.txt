Senator Sanders tells the truth & cares about the American people. Thank you Bernie!

About time you did something
Thank you all. I was a nurse for 15 years. This will help.
why this bill and not the first Rx import bill @BernieSanders introduced! Thank you for finally seeing the light!
THANKS TO SENATORS CANTWELL, JAYAPAL, AND SANDERS FOR THIS LEGISLATION!
THANK YOU!
.@SenatorCantwell @RepJayapal @BernieSanders says the hypocrite who voted down bill to lower drug costs for all Americans about a month ago.
you went against 70% of your state with your superdelegate vote How does it feel electing Trump?
thank you for continuing to fight for our healthcare
Finally listening. Too bad you didn't do that in the primaries & misused your superdelegate vote
thank you for responding to your constituents concerns re prescription drugs access
Thank you all for that. It will be hard but don't give up! How can we help?
Now you can take some credit for it even though you originally voted against Bernie's bill.
goid luck.
Somehow you have to convince the republicans "health care for all, as a right"
Wait, you mean prescriptions aren't safe already?
thank you!! Very good to see after your initial vote.
you think Ted Cruz will sign on?
#StandUpToBigPharma

@SenFeinstein @RepJimmyPanetta about time the congress ends the give away to big pharma.
Thank you
@ImpactDemocracy @RepJayapal @BernieSanders thank you!  - wa state constituent
Thank you!
.@SenatorCantwell @RepJayapal @BernieSanders You are listening to your constituents!!
Who cares.  You're another crook who ran under false pretences.  #politics
can you please change the name and make it shorter
How about bringing some Repubs in so it can actually pass, or do you enjoy wasting your time?
Thank you!
Thank You!
Your dedication to improving the quality of life for many is appreciated!!
She strongly supported the TPP and that would have destroyed lives.
Serious question. How will an overwhelmed FDA be able to make sure drug imports are safe?
they can't it is symbolic. Republicans already handled this two weeks ago
Thank U all for looking out for us avg 'Joes':@DNC had better become more inclusive of mid class
is this more Medicaid too?
hope you don't get corporate democrated by Booker and his paid off p.o.s again.
My bet is @CoryBooker will vote against it like he did the last time at the beck of his corp overlords.
We screw the American people with Obamacare & with losing Whitehouse we trying to make it right.
You're lucky Bernie doesnt hold grudges. We know youre owned by pharmaceutical companies. Im ashamed youre my senator.
