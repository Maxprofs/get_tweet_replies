Wow! Talk about demagoguery.
@abracadabraNY must be bannons hate revenge on everything Obama - bannon is dangerously undoing years of progress
@ImpactDemocracy And there are more clean energy jobs now than fossil fuel jobs.
yes but solar energy doesn't make any money for the predator in chief and his comrades
Maria, obstructionists need to say 3 Hail Marys!
It is not the EPA anymore, now is the Elite Protection Agency, created for polluters to destroy Mother Earth and make money
RECALL INSLEE AND CANTWELL FOR TREASON AND SEDITION MURRAY MAKES THE LIST OF TRAITORS TO WASHINGTON STATE AND AMERICA
Inslee is not in line to be president, you're confused.
look up chain of command and continuity of government. As an elected governor he is after house and senate
And exactly how many republicans would have to die before a Dem is handed the presidency by default ?
the dems are going to find out when they try to use continuity of gov. to remove him.it will go to maj leader
Everything you say is a hypothetical.
we need environmental protections. Corporations will put profit before environmental protections.
I remember when Maria actually stood for things.  What happened?
I move to impeach him.
Maria it's time for you to go
I am astonished at lengths @POTUS goes 2. Does he have a soul? He gets worse & worse. So f*** destructive!!!
thank you for fighting for sensible action to combat climate change! Our future depends on it.
@brayla72 Sad!
@RepJayapal U r either seriously misinformed or ur lying thru ur teeth. Read POTUS's statements on alternative energy.
And what can be done about it? Short of the peasants carrying pitchforks? Our Democracy is only as good as the corrupt Rs
Exchanging "job killing" regulations for human killing pollutants ?  Thanks to a narrow-minded president.
@SenateDems That's the republicans for you...anything for a goddamned dollar. BTW, greed is a sin.
Clean and alternative energy = new job opportunities for displaced coal miners and others.  Step in the wrong direction.
@SenateDems He is making us a financial super power again. That's what made us great. That's how we won WWII, Japan
@RepJayapal And what are you 2 doing about it? You are in leadership and we need extraordinary action. Why not take it??
Funny how you voted to fast track TPP.
what can we do to over ride these EO's?  Our Rep. McMorris Rogers won't help.
I am virtually neurologically aware of this!   How do we get that criminal, sex-offending traitor out of our White House?!
wrong! liberal lie as usual
@SenateDems What does cleanenergy superpower mean? do you want more national deficit? you fund it!
Polluters who don't and won't create new jobs-#KeystonePipeline initial construction jobs, then 35FT 15PT
and right on cue comes the first of the trump era tv shows -->
So what are you doing about it besides tweeting?
Nothing. Just rhetoric. Finger pointing. No plan. No vision.
@SierraClub Not to worry. Other nations will profit & save from clean energy. USA will disappear, sort of like Neanderthal.
@SierraClub exactly!  Sickening son's of B's
Not that we need to BREATHE or anything....
THERE IS NO MARKET 4 COAL!!! THE ENTIRE WORLD IS MOVING ON! DUMB-DUMB IS LYING 2 HIS PEEPS #cleanenergy #msnbc
We are racing to the bottom!
Do something. Stop him. #russiagate
How will you vote on the Gorsuch cloture? We, your constituents, are asking for an answer. It should be "no."
Maria, what exactly is Trump doing to harm the environment? This is nothing but "Fake News" to wind up all the "SnowFlakes"
@SenateDems no he is not. Energy independence from others stilling our money no more kick back for outside lobbies
There is no such thing.
@SenateDems The undoing will be simple once the garbage is out
Sorry 4 #InconvenientTruth, but @POTUS is REVERSING "pocket-lining" of Al Gore et al., 2 grow economy/add jobs.
@SenateDems Yes we were leaders in this area Now look foolish doing 360 in order to line pockets of rich companies
Thank you for pointing that out, Senator; now what are you doing to convince the rest of congress how bad this is?
@SenateDems Climate change is BS
@SenateDems Truth is abhorrent to the Trump administration, its penchant to destroy any good that inhibits lining pockets.
@SenateDems essentially. Nice to have low friends in high places
Super Power of #cleanenergy ?  Superpower of Lies, Death and Destruction.. Is all I see...
Then you should vote no on the nomination and cloture of Gorsuch.
@SenateDems Senator Can't -do -much-Well are you proud of this ignorant statement and proud of Obama attacks on US workers?
Polluters, otherwise known as his cronies. #tillerson #pruitt #perry just to name a few. They care nothing for our planet
@SenateDems our 'clean energy' was sending all our jobs to 'dirty' countries.
#cleanenergy you know he has no idea what he is doing or signing #incoherent #mentalmidget
@SenateDems investigate the Trump family's  recent investments to see if coal companies are there #kleptocracy
Too many Dems have financial interest in these climate change co's and projects.
Wrong.Undoing Obama's design: keep US beholding 2 ME oil as historic resources uncovered in US allow US exit ME
@SenateDems This is a criminal act against humanity and the planet.
@SenateDems Lier!!  Taking away MONEY from THE pocket who profit off of it. Tell the truth for once brainwashing twits...
If liberal dems have their way, they are just lining their own pockets/their families whom have finance in this
@SenateDems no we will be the worlds energy power nit wit @GOP
The Trump Administration is sabotaging EVERYTHING GOOD ABOUT AMERICA! Our Founders are screaming from their tombs!
THANK YOU! Fight for #CleanEnergy
"President" @realDonaldTrump has become a Toxic Crusaders supervillain.
@SenateDems impeachment is taking too long.  Investigation going on since July.  What's taking so long? America in danger
@SenateDems climate change is as fake as the dems and CNN
.@SenatorCantwell @SenateDems imagine the long term clean, safe and healthy jobs we could have brought to coal country.
I agree! #wrongkindofgreen
@SenateDems Trump has no love of country, that is evident.
Sadly, neither do liberals.
Not only that, He also lowers your credability in the eyes of the world in environmental questions.
The Trump Administration and the GOP are sabotaging our chances of staying Americans.
LOL
liar
@markwellsrector stand up to 45! #resist #Trumprussia #TrumpTaxReturns #SessionsMustResign
All in the name of short term financial gain for a few at the expense of the many in the long term.
Thank you. However, it's time to start saying this directly to 45. Or attach the letter you've sent. Petitions from WA St.
Sad, keep on peddling the BS...
luckily WA is still for clean energy at the state level
