Thank you Senator Cantwell (my Senator) and all other Democratic Senators fighting for us!
Then don't approve them. You walked out on your job. We call that voluntarily quit.
@foggybottomgal @SenateDems And DeVos?
when you were WA State legislator, you were tough & creative.  We need you now. Situation feels hopeless.
.@SenatorCantwell @HumanoidTroll @SenateDems Why can't you boycott all of the hearings?
and Believe me you will be voted out in States Trump won Watch 2018
Thank you senator!
THANK YOU FROM SNOHOMISH VOTER
thank you for representing us on this. It's been a disheartening thing to see folks roll over for this admin.
Thank your for standing up for all Americans and standing up to the one trying to steal power from Congress!
Thank you. As an RN, I want a Sec of Health who's invested in protecting the people, not the private insurance companies.
Boycott? Repubs just changed rules & approved crooks Price & Mnuchin w/o Dems. Fix this to reject both!
Your obstruction is the only voice the majority has in Washington right now. Otherwise we are not represented.
Thank you for boycotting these hearings. You all need to publicize Tom Price's radical views on Medicare more.
you still cashing your paycheck?
@ActDontReact @SenateDems It's unacceptable to not get a full and substantial hearings. Especially with this characters.
Thank You.  Totally supportive of all I've seen from Senate Dems today.
Good job! Thank you!
great!!! Also Sessions and DeVos, please.
Thank you- We need to see more solidarity against what is happening from Dem's
You're a Democrat of course you oppose everything President Trump does. It's part of your job description.

good for you. Thank you!
That's big of you.  Slow govmt down because you've got all the time and OUR money you need.

@SumerSloan @SenateDems if you're waiting for Trump to tell the truth, it's going to be a long wait.
Thank you Senator Cantwell

Thank you!
Keep up the good work. We are behind you!
thank you!!! Keep up the good work -- you're doing WA & USA a solid!
As a constituent, thank you!
You're all pissing into the wind...Trump is Pres.  Get outta the way if you aren't interested in #MAGA 
SHAME on you we will take to the voting polls in two years and kick out all the Democrats you've been warned
thnk you, Senator Cantwell! Resistance is not futile. Especially not against a fascist regime #impeachTrumpnow
Thank you for Boycotting Mnuchin and Price.
As your constituent I thank you. Hold them accountable. Get more info. No to DeVos also! (99336)
@SumerSloan @SenateDems THANK YOU! KEEP UP THE OPPOSITION! THIS IS AMERICA!
Thank you for your leadership.  My concern is: will boycotting the hearings expedite the confirmations?
thank you! More of this please. Coordinated #Resistance until Bannon and #nomuslimban
You go, girl!
can u guys please block DeVos the woman sends fear down every students back she's so clueless 
THANK YOU for boycotting. Now, as your constituent, please block ALL Senate business til the EO is rescinded. #NoBanNoWall
Be aggressive with the NOs!  The people are ready to stand up and fight back against TYRANNY!
Drain the swamp. You ppl all need to be replaced. Respect our Pres.  Your opinion means 0
They are both extremely dangerous appointees. Thank you for fighting their confirmations!
Then vote No. Only cowards refuse to show up for a fight!
thank you!!!!!!
Thank you and all the Dems. Good work
@PattyMurray We're behind you! Only political downside is if you DON'T obstruct. #StopSessions #StopDeVos
@AngieinWAState @SenateDems Please defy over and over!
Rinse and repeat!
I need help I am feeling defeated.  I am going to a meeting tonight to make plans.
THANK U! Pls remind Reps #wearewatching & will ardently fight reelection bids 4 anyone voting YES on #Sessions
Thank you Sen. Cantwell for doing the right thing! #RoboSigning lies should disqualify Mnuchin!
Constituent here, and I say Yes! More of this! Stall everything! Deny consent! Don't let authoritarian regime advance power
we need you and  @SenateDems and @PattyMurray to #stopsessions as well! I am a constituent. I vote. I will not forget this.
Trump is aware of the @wikileaks scandal Pizzagate, and his insiders tend to tell him to bring the pedophile charges....
So as to clean the government out and all opposition. Infowars made clear that he wants to do it. "Drain the swamp."
I believe the Dems and you need to vote Yes, or that he will bring it all out with a No. It will shock everyone. His nuke.
The American people could be given a working government otherwise, it would be the happy ending for all sides. 
A Yes.
thank you!
What do you hope to acheive? Boycotting works with money, not votes where we NEED YOUR NO.
problem probably is that the Y's would out vote the N's..
I still want to see those no's on the record unless a boycott will achieve something.
is that the same as a 'no'vote?
As you should. Enough of the ramming it down our throats upending of American values. Thank you
@IndivisibleTac @SenateDems - Thank you for standing up and demanding what is right!
well done! Stay strong!
THANK YOU!
@PattyMurray  @SenateDems Why no boycott of the #BetsyDeVos vote??
When will you call for the resignation of Bannon from the NSC and WH?
I've come to the conclusion that the alt-left has now become the the enemy of America
TY! My daughter, wife and I are counting on you to FIGHT and resist! Our children's future is in your hands
THANK YOU this is a beginning. You MUST block all bills and progress until the Immigration ban is gone!
.@SenatorCantwell @SenateDems 
Pls remind protesters of lack of D action against R's Congress & POTUS initiatives to assure electing a D majority Congress
THANK YOU! Standing with you #Resist #StandUpToTrump
thnk you senator cantwell! Hold the line.
@PattyMurray  Keep it up!
Thank you! - from an appreciative constituent who is very proud of her state this week
DO YOUR JOB!! You don't take YOUR Ball and Go Home!! #BeAccountable
Thank you.  Please keep standing up for us against injustice. Don't let this slide.
Thank you!
Thank you!
ABOUT TIME Dems did something!
As your constituent I strongly support your actions on these nominees.
Thank you for this action. This constituent (99354) agrees with your assessment and supports your actions.

Thank you. Please vote no to all the nominees. Continue to fight for us
but does boycotting *change* anything?
Thank you, Senator!
@SenateFinance @SenateDems Shame on you! WE the people chose. We demand our new GOV now! We don't appreciate your games!
I ask that you obstruct anything you can offered by Trump and his Republican enablers.
I support your decisions, Senator. Thank you. Kris from Tacoma.
THANK YOU!!!!!
Thank You Senator!
Awesome. Now do this for all of the nominees. Start the impeachment process while you're at it.
I don't understand what boycotting accomplishes.  It seems to leave you without a voice.
thank you.
Thank you! More of this please. This is not business as usual with this administration. #resist
I don't care if there's one or two open seats if the nominations are inappropriate stand against them both
thank you.  This is what Americans need now.  Our leaders standing up for right and doing it in  very public
YES!! VOTE NO FOR ALL OFTHEM!
Thank you. More of this please! #resist
Why didn't you say something about Patty Murray, Denny Heck or Derrick Kilmer. THE DO NOTHING DEMS. NOTHING !
When are you going to join the filibuster? Why is there only one person planning to do it? STAND UP.
And vote to #StopSessions! Be a representative that we can be proud of, not just shrug and say, yeah, she's ok
Thank you!
good-will make these votes go faster.
If you can't lead get out of the way. You may have just been elected but we are watching and Wii remember
I'm going 2 guess you didn't vote for her anyway. These actions are inline with her stated values.
if you send them I wI'll read them with an open mind
keep It Up
thankyou!
thank you for fighting for what's right
but will you vote to #StopSessions, Senator?
too early to start working on impeachment? This guy is nuts.

Well done! Thank you for taking this stand!
