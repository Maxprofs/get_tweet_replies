.@btenergy launches a $1B investment fund for reliable, affordable, emissions-free energy... http://www.b-t.energy/ventures/ 
I'm terrified that Trump's EPA director will destroy all protections for us to have clean air and water. Especially with pipe lines
Now we have Trump!Tears:gambling with all our lives.Think he's invested pipelines &Russian loans!Fail, hope impeachment!Mental evaluationDjt
yes indeed. we are fixing to watch you get filthy rich on your hoax aren't we Barry Soetero!
@BillGates @btenergy FUCK TRUMP
I JUST WANT OBAMA FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!
@ I work for the welfare system and most of the people are Trump supporters
I wrote this in December and was shot down by Trump  Supporters as 'fake news'.
@BillGates @btenergy POTUS you MUST release info on Russian interference in our election for all citizens to see. Do it quickly
can't release a fairy tale. It never happened except in Hillary's crooked mind.
you're a friggin idiot. You'll deserve what you are about to get with donny as prez
How does a dead person vote? Democrat. Ask my grandfather WwII Rip died at Midway
@KyleKulinski
Your vision is what we all see, at least those of us with brains and can spell vision.
@BillGates @btenergy How well did your last green investment go? #solyndra
@realDonaldTrump did that bitch!
good job to PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP!
.@POTUS Thank you for your support. More affordable, reliable energy means better lives and stronger economies.
good endorsement by the former president.
@BillGates @btenergy can't wait for Trump to fix the mess you created
Stay in Russia. Your fake pic too. Troll. @USAneedsTRUMP @POTUS @BillGates @btenergy
hey when you lose, just blame it on Russia LOL  LOL 
It's not about the loss, it is about Russia trying to elect trump, and undermine us.
Russia didn't turn blue states red. America did.
this is about Russia illegally hacking into DNC to effect our election.

Sir, with all due respect, (lots) Please don't leave us to the orange menace!
Maybe you can follow Obama to the country where his policies work...think it's called fantasyland!!!
Twitter should come with a feature where you can just block everyone named deplorable. Would save so much time.
I would love that
I am fearful that all of your good work will be canceled one day one of Trump term.  If it doesn't benefit him he doesn't care
It didn't benefit any of us....so yes it will be gone...good riddance
renewable energy sources don't benefit any of us? Wow
I hope Americans are now seeing what is happening especially Trump supporters. The chickens are now coming home to roost.
@BillGates @btenergy good to see so many investors come together and blow the markets through the roof because we now have hope!
@BillGates @btenergy Please don't go Obama!!!
Smart invest? How? Cuz some old guy said so?
@KyleKulinski @LeCamp
How many billions of tax payer dollars have you pissed away so far?
I want Barry Micheal Robinson & two loaner imposter daughters alias  Obama's that holding up our White House robbing tax payers money
@BillGates @btenergy So why do we have regulations that make solar energy a financial impossibility for homeowners??
@BillGates @btenergy with all due respect, -Russian hacking investigation; #FreeSyria. Please help. 
I'm glad we made a change. I'm sure trump knows who to keep at arm's length,
I'm sure he doesn't and hasn't learned . The is just a flame thrower for Putin. Grow up.  @nyokajungle @POTUS @BillGates @btenergy

@BillGates @btenergy Love you Mr. President!
we need another term

@BillGates @btenergy as long as it doesn't come out of my pocket who cares, don't flatter ur self u didn't start green energy
Everyone around the globe expect US to continue this momentum. But no words from next president DJT on Green energy initiatives.
Too bad world's largest populations China & India ect aren't in on it! We'll be paying for nothing!

It's only great if at the same time you're stopping the destruction of the earth by Big Oil & their investors, like Wells Fargo

@sandyhussain @BillGates @btenergy What trump sez & does r different depending on how many ShinyRubles flow his way. Thanks y'all.
كلام
We are taking steps to a better future. Climate change is a problem that cannot be ignored and requires unity to be solved.
@BillGates sounds no different than @realDonaldTrump. Promises, loose worded "plans" and LOTS of MY (OUR) tax dollars. You fund it!
@BillGates @btenergy I'm going to miss him and his dedication to our environment . Great president!
@BillGates @btenergy 
Great to see you gone in 30 
Asta la vista
U were living in a movie
wonder who's more delusional U or Michelle.
@AllLeftNews  AWESONE SAY IT W ME CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL 99.9% scientist agree
@BillGates @btenergy it's a scam
I am hopeful that the IT private sector will put some checks and balances on the coal-loving administration that is coming into power.
@AllLeftNews @BillGates @btenergy   Going to miss you POTUS
I pray the incoming pres. keeps this work up
saw yr last #PressConference as President  in wee hrs. Not lookg fwd to the bully-elect. @BillGates @btenergy & @elonmusk TY&!
@BillGates @btenergy I'm sure they are well funded by misappropriated tax money!
@BillGates @btenergy Smart investors and great world leaders. Will be amazing what Bill Gates and Trump can do together
@BillGates @btenergy How long did Gates try to get ur admin to sppt small modular reactors? Zero green house emissions! U wouldn't!
@BillGates @btenergy so true...Mr. Gates please explain how could be the next JFK- many of us are baffled by you saying this.
@BillGates @btenergy Mahalo!
@RobertKleiburg Ulike Trump and his coal mining swamp monsters! 
CO2 is not a pollutant. And we only emit 3% of total emissions/yr. Y u blieve 97% scientists but not 97% natural emissions?
Wish he had put a billion into the healthcare package for the people
@BillGates @btenergy I need something more simple to put directly in my home 2 clean the air. Especially when I am a cancer survivor.
@BillGates @btenergy he spoke with Pres Elect get that straight
"electricity rates necessarily skyrocketing" didn't work out too well. Ya think? Gates is thankful for CAPITALISM NOT SOCIALISM
@BillGates @btenergy where is Solyndra? Where is our $500 million dollars???
THEY are no listening to the cry of the earth, and what we do is NOTING compared to what THEY could do to heal the earth.
I understand that we have to keep working towards the clean energy BUT what is the use if the BIGGEST ONES are NOT on board?
@BillGates @btenergy plentiful cheap energy is here now and disruption ensues
. I want u
