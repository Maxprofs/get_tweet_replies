@TheTylerWest Do U have school age children? Are U raising them in WA state? Do U have any idea what ur talking about?
Sure, I see praise from Government, I mean Public EDUCATORS. Where is the praise from PARENTS OF CHILDREN? Hmmm?
Well, my wife is a spec. ed teacher & we disagree with that sentiment. Donâ€™t buy into hype & disinformation
I don't. DeVos just doesn't know what she is doing and worse, she doesn't care. 
Thank you! signed, a constituent from Lynnwood WA

Sorry about all of that. I still wish you would vote Yes for DeVos. Have a nice day. signed - a parent and constituent.
@TheTylerWest In fact, we probably dont have much in common...4 example. I dont follow DailyPorn or YoungButtPlug like U.
@TheTylerWest taking a stab in the dark here. Ur not WA resident. Ur not a parent. Ur just making trouble.
@TheTylerWest Still haven't answered if u have kids and are living in WA.
thank you! We really appreciate your hard work!
@TheTylerWest I also see ur tweet abt "religious gun nuts" does not show here.. What happened to tolerance?
Thank you. Keep up the fight - win or lose - and we'll remain in support in 2018. Oppose Gorsuch for Garland's seat.
Thank you!

Thank you from my grandchildren  and me!

As a constituent, so SAD to hear you will vote no. We need DeVos for school choice! I will work against your next campaign.
DeVos would be horrible for the country the education system is already bad her affect on youth would be awful.
thank you for your no vote
We must keep her out---what can we do?
Thank you Senator!
Thank you for listening and thank you for your no vote.
No normalization of Trump. Watch every move
.@SenatorCantwell thank you for hearing us! Vote no on Sessions and Puzder too!
We know that your No for DeVos is really just a Yes to the teachers' unions who donate to your campaign.
thank you!
Could we just skip it all and get rid of the useless Dept. of Education all together?
I'm a constituent and I thank you.
Way to stand up for kids! Thank you, Senator.
Thank you. I hope you can convince some of our republican friends to vote no as well.
