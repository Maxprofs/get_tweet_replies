Please #FilibusterGorsuch and vote against #cloture. Any other vote is a vote against women's rights. Do the right thing
please vote no.
#gorsuch is bad news for women
Supports Hobby Lobby. Enough said.
too much IS at stake. Extremist GOP want to take away human rights and turn this country white Christian.
we are all VERY concerned about this appointment and for the future of my daughters I pray you can block it!
they also deserve senators that don't vote for big pharma  and primary candidates there constituents didn't vote for
concerns = filibuster? When answering, please remember that primaries exist. #GarlandNotGorsuch #FilibusterGorsuch
you and the Tennis shoe mom @PattyMurray  both supported Gorsuch in 2006, what has changed?? #flipflop
Concerns is not nearly strong enough. Filibuster.
nice job Maria!! Bold!! To the point.. yes!!
As one of your constituents, I implore you to vote NO and called your DC office yday to state same.  @SenatorCantwell
We need to be protected from weak appointees such as Gorsuch!
@SenateDems @NancyPelosi @keithellison @TomPerez this message should come unanimous from by all of you today
Vote NO on his confirmation. We deserve and demand better. #StopGorsuch
AGAIN, what does this fluffy, "I have concerns" thing mean?  #NoOnGorsuch
NO to Gorsuch!
Are you going to prevent his confirmation with a filibuster? He will not protect women's reproductive rights. #StopGorsuch
oh stop.  Our right is to have sex/not, use protection/not or raise child/adoption. Those are our rights
*Currently*, I also have the right to have an abortion and to receive my birth control from my employer plan.
muder isn't a right.
No #SCOTUS Nominee until the PEOPLES VOICES ARE HEARD! Merritt Garland or Nothing until 2021.
Thank you.
I like Gorsuch. Please support him with your vote.
full protection of our rights begins with you! APPROVE #SCOTUS justice #gorsuch! But you can't be trusted!
filibuster. Obstruct. Resist
 Its that simple.  No confirmation until Garlan gets a hearing or McConnell nukes it.
one word: filibuster
say what u mean u want a judge who legislates from the bench who is a liberal judge. That's why POTUS 45 will b in WH 8 yrs
u r concerned that he will follow the constitution because u and your far left libs know if that's the case u lose.
Confirm Gorsuch.
oh please
Please commit to voting NO!
Thank you Senator Cantwell for looking after us!  We need more like you in DC.
I don't understand, he was fine the last time you voted for him? But not now you hypocrite who wastes taxpayers money!
Please vote no on Gorsuch, Senator. Then insist on a vote for  Garland. Thanks, a constituent.
@SenateDems Yes we do. Filibuster all the way! !
Thank you for speaking out. @SenateGOP made it clear that there is no need to confirm SCOTUS pick quickly, or ever.
Vote NO, Senator. Gorsuch sided with companies imposing their religion on staff. And: The seat belongs to Merrick Garland.
Please commit to a 60-vote threshold along with Sens. Schumer and Murray. Your constituents are counting on you. #Gorsuch
Just say no.
@SenateDems 
Shame on the Republicans for even suggesting such a person stop this madness now
Gorusch will back Trump in all his abuses of power.  That's all you need to make you vote no.
what u tweeted here shows exactly why cons will make sure POTUS 45 is in the White House 8yrs.u people r idiots
Your concern is he follows the Constitution unlike Democratic nominees who do your job and legislate from the bench
Remember Merrick Garland? There's no decision here to make. OBSTRUCT
which rights are you concerned with? Be specific. 2nd Amendment??
vote no! We do not want someone who is in favor of Citizens United. Corporations are not people!
#FilibusterGorsuch He'll get confirmed anyway but @SenateDems need to take a stand once and for all.
so many concerns that you're voting NO, right?
Stolen seat. #NeverCondirm
Postpone hearings until FBI investigation is finished.
@SenateDems keep thinking those thoughts Senator, Gorsuch is NOT appropriate for appointment to SCOTUS
We also deserve a nomination by a Pres who isn't under investigation for election fraud!
Keep pushing!
then actually confirm your position as no. @SEAindivisible #Indivisible
@SenateDems Republicans took their fight all the way, what are Democrats going to do? @SenGaryPeters @SenSchumer @stabenow
no hearings until Russia probe completed!
Treasonous president shld not nominate to #SCOTUS.  #NoGorsuch
Garland didn't even get a hearing so why does Gorsuch or any republican nominee? #Resistance
@SenateDems Filibuster.  Make them take it away.  Go to the wall. Yield not one g'ddamn thing.
Translation: You don't want to confirm judges who follow the Constitution and don't make law up from the bench.
filibuster!
FILIBUSTER
Understand why U w/o edu.,resume o The Honorable Gorsuch & lacking understanding role of SCOTUS confused 
@SenateDems you must suspend #SCOTUS hearings until impeachment proceedings start and end. #IllegitimatePOTUS
Block Gorsuch!
@SenateDems he's gonna clear!!
don't make the Bork mistake. learn fr past errors, Dems.
@SenateDems #VoteNoGorsuch
vote no!
I would hope you & @PattyMurray would NOT vote to confirm this extremist SC nominee. The Senate must filibuster Gorsuch.
Agreed.  Especially when investigations underway currently. Need to pause & be systematic about this decision.
then filibuster
See? "I have concerns". Weak, that's why we lost. "I will not vote for such a person" With conviction!!!
@SenateDems VOTERS DEMAND HALT TO ALL APPOINTMENTS /LEGISLATION UNTIL THE STOLEN ELECTION IS FULLY INVESTIGATED. NO TRUST.
I have more than concerns, he's clearly pro-business and decided on his interpretation of social injustice, women's rights.
- that seat was stolen and CANNOT go to him.
HE BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION! If Satan were nominated you tools would support him...tell me I'm wrong you candyass libs!
Put a hold on any further nominations until Russian investigation completed!!
His judicial record is bad on human, environmental, and democratic rights. I support full blockage of his nomination.
Please do not consider #Gorsuch for Supreme Court until investigation into #TrumpRussia is complete. No SC nominee from a foreign agent.
Don't vote for Gorsuch. Do what it takes to throw 45's regime out, then vote for a decent government.
Vote no!!
I agree. Please vote against this nominee.
Vote NO! This man will put party first and will not be concerned about our rights!
That, plus he was nominated by an illegitimate president.
CANTdoyourjobWELL is my concern of you
Vote no on Gorsuch!

Stolen seat!

Only Garland!

Obstruct 4 years- all the way!

#SCOTUS #Resist #impeach #treason
No 4 years for #45 and no votes for his nominees!

So many concerns, even though unanimously voted for in '06? Please explain.
I have serious concerns about #Gorsuch too. Please keep protecting our rights. #WAvoter #WestSeattleResident
His name isn't Merrick Garland. Until he's the nominee, no vote.
Please do not vote for him. Please.
