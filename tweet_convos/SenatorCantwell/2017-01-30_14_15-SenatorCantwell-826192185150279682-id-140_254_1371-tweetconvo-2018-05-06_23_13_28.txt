We need to hear you speaking out about Trump more loudly!

When do the impeachment proceedings start?
should have started six months ago.
I know right? Trump's unfitness is so apparent he should have washed out in the primaries.
I was referring to Obama....lol
What impeachment-worthy offense did Obama commit 6 months ago?
When you release any terrorist at Gitmo many people would support impeaching him but the politicians have no  balls
Loser! You need to be voted out asap!
No DeVos No DeVos this is Nuts !
thank you for standing with Standing rock by  requesting the EIS be completed.

What would Bill do?

Thank you!!! Keep fighting!!!
Neither will we, see you next election cycle. Your LACK OF SUPPORT for @POTUS and #AmericaFirst will be paid!
#AmericaFirst
Right on Mary!...
we all have rights
if you put this much energy into fighting fraud there would not be any
The dems have an agenda. You know the EO is exactly same as Obama's. You are on Team Obstruction. STOP.
Ridiculous
Thank you both for fighting the illegal, cruel and dangerous #MuslimBan.  We support you!
how is this a ban?

Thank you for your relentless work in keeping this unconstitutional ban at bay. #WeWillNotBeSilenced
Sorry that U vote against  legally won pres Trump than a shill like Feinstein .Trump loves country
#fightorflight! #resisttrump #WeThePeople #OurVoice #WeWillVoteYouOut
please find common ground & don't throw the baby out with the bath water.  No civilization jihad please!

THANK YOU!

and the family of this girl thanks you.
Thank you. #resist #resisttrump #resistmisogyny
Senator- PLEASE get trump out of office before our country is completely destroyed.
We are disappointed to seeing cabinet picks moving through with your votes!  It is horrible to watch
finally a senator with some balls!!
Thank  you - Senator !
Great! It's not like you have no long-pending, unfinished business to deal with in your own district
Thank you for your support and for standing up for what's right. We are with you!
What is the SB number on that?
Keep fighting! Call to arms Senators, use the filibuster
@washingtonpost @KTLAnewsdesk @business Congress Supports Sen. Feinstein in Leg. to Silence @POTUS @nypost
.@SenatorCantwell fight them every turn, filibuster, withhold consent, force substantial bipartisan compromise or shut down the government!
you represent us conservative republicans too! Vote carefully!
thank you! Stand tall and stay strong!
US should be a sanctuary for US citizens, you work for us! Once people become Americans you work for them
fight to build 5 star, US standard,  refugee camps in their country, don't bring them here
you should be fighting for the current citizens of the US not looking to import new citizens
oh, you will stop once we elect someone to replace you in the next election.
THANK YOU!
no yes votes on any tRump nominees. #dumptrump #indivisible
NEVER STOP! RESIST! We can't support you unless you fight the fight WE mandate! You guys work for US!
VOTE NO ON SESSIONS, PRUITT AND TILLERSON.
Thank you from a grateful constituent of Senator Cantwells and a very very motivated voter.
glad! More moderate @TheDemocrats for us. @BobLeahyJr It only took Trump 5 days to erase 8 years of STUPID!
Say no to Bannon on NSC! Dangerous!
Thank you
America first Americans first
Please block it all. Illegal EO, unqualified, unvetted appointees, fascist "advisors"  You are our hope.
Thank you for your fierce resistance to the EO ban.  I implore you to fight with all you have!
Thank you.  Please block everything.
You dismiss those supporting executive order as un-American; half of the population, half of the House/Senate. Who are YOU?
Thank you!
thank you!
THANK YOU! More of this! We need you to stand and resist OUT LOUD!! #stopsessions
Why don't you admit #Obama came up with that list and actually,  dozens more countries should be on it.
Thank you @SenFeinstein for your no vote on Sessions. Please decide to also vote no on Sessions, @SenatorCantwell
.@SenatorCantwell Feinstein's efforts would be more credible if she hadn't voted to confirm #Trump appointees.
Now PLEASE filibuster the nominee for Supreme Court!
Thank you. Stay strong!
Glad to see your leadership on this. Keep it up.
vote 'no' on @SenatorSessions as AG. We need a AG who's loyal to constitution not @potus #mondaynightmassacre
An incompetent mess. I hope Drumpf is just as  inept w/ his insane agenda as this unconstitutional exec order
@ktoddhouston @SenFeinstein remove Bannon don't confirm devos
drain the swamp, you'll need your water wings.
a loyalty oath should not be a requirement for government service #notinmyname
how about reading the #EO. Shame he promised this and now executed it.
Thank you for standing up for America.
Then could you please work on taking down tRump? Because President Pumpkin  has already proven himself incompetent
whoa but can you explain THIS? https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/ â€¦
Keep fighting!
Thank you Senators. Stay strong! Keep fighting for us. #StopPresidentBannon #ImpeachTrump
Will the Senate find out Session's position on this EO before tomorrow's vote?
whos going to start impeachment not sure what your all waiting for our protests r going to move past you guys
And will you be voting no on all nominees?
Thank you #WeAreAllImmigrants
As your constituent, thank you!!!
@womensmarchsea @SenFeinstein  members of the house and Senate also need to find a way to get Bannon of NSC.
thank you. Senator Feinstein, you are my senator.
Thank you!
thank you
Please also publicly and to oppose Bannon's appointment to the NSC. Thank you.
Thank you so much! Proud to be one of your voters!
@womensmarchsea @SenFeinstein as long as you are not joining her in approving his nominees.
go! Go!
If we stop fighting, we lose everything. #ResistTrump #NoBanNoWall #MuslimBan
please block the EPA nominee & save our parks!
God bless you.  Please start impeachment proceedings.
I support you in this wholeheartedly. We must fight these discriminatory policies!
Thank you!
thank you for your leadership on this issue!
thank you!
safe to assume then you will be opposing every cabinet nominee too? We expect NOTHING less.
Quit while you're ahead. The travel pause is necessary for process evaluation. 
Wake up!!!
@Anna_B1124 @SenFeinstein please vote against EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE he puts up. I've tried calling but it's busy. #Stop45
Thank You!  Now make sure you have the votes.
thank you for doing something!
excellent! Keep it up!
Thank you.
@hrdwrkmom @SenFeinstein it was Obama who put this law in place actually.
For a bill to become a law it needs to be signed by the president. Watch this
Word is that #LGBTRights are next. Please keep fighting. #WeGotYourBack #TheResistance is real
That is simply not true. Trump supports the LGBT community.
Thank you and please do not stop fighting.

Have you seen this:
Mostly I'm seeing who's opposing it (great barometer for few years) & read the EO. You?
Well, that's great, but how about @SenFeinstein stop being #1 sen voting w/ *45? Higher than Rs! How about impeach *45?
Thank you @SenatorCantwell for standing against hate!
as your constituent, thank you! For representing me faithfully, and doing the right thing.
Thank you! People of Washington are fighting at your side, don't let us down, don't let us outfight you :)
please block everything, Senators. You cannot work with fascism, you an only empower them. Block. Everything.
Thank you, Senators!
Thank you!
#sourgrapes #sorelosers #Hypocrites you work for me too !
is Dem Senator in a Dem state. Move to a shithole like Kansas if you want a Rep. Senator
Thank you for working to overturn! Be loud and proud!
