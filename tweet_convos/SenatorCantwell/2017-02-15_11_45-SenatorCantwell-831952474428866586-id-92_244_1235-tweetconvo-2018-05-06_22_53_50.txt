I called the White house comment line and asked to see his taxes and have given friends the number and they called as well
Of course we do! Trump is owned by Russia! What are you hiding @realDonaldTrump in those taxes?! #impeach45 #treason
would this mean 45 has to show his taxes or only future presidents?
@DshlTamara YES I DO!!!!!!!!
3 years not enough!
@kristineshofner I care to see how much Russia bought America for.
Kellyanne is correct. I could care less. If it was important nobody would have voted for him. Water under the bridge now.

Thank you on behalf of this WA voting family. You speak and fight for us.
Were you just a worried and concerned about Hillary's Benghazi?
We very much care!  He is hiding something.
I voted for you & I care about his taxes, too. Keep up the hard work! We are behind you
Will you disclose yours too? Checks and balances, you know.
@ReSister2016 we DO care! Scenarios: he paid nothing, he is hiding something--Russian funds, or he is broke.

Keep up the strong work Senator. His taxes are very important to all Americans, there are too many conflicts of interest.

when @realDonaldTrump releases his taxes, he will be impeached as he is a tax evader. SHAMEFUL
