So, once you harden the schools... will you move on to hardening churches? Movie theaters? Ball Parks? Stadiums? Malls? Or... maybe you could help ensure mass murderers only had access to knives and bats instead of semi-automatic weapons?
Typical Rubio...You've lost ANY credibility you had!
Marco Rubio after Tillerson's confirmation hearing vs. Marco Rubio today 
Why didn't you run a better campaign and beat Trump in the primary?
He’d have been just as bad!
Oh I agree. Just holding their feet to fire.
When I hear term "hardening" reminds me of prison hardening back in the 90s, please don't turn schools into prisons, deal with cause, NOW!
Bribe from NRA
You screwed it up http://Rubio.You  need ousted, like Trumpo, and pensive boy.
Coward: first stating that a “space professional” should lead NASA (Bridenstine lacks experience and denied clim. change) and then voting to confirm B. just because he’s Trump’s pick. The point of senate confirmations is to keep unqualified people from key posts, not to kiss ass.
"what we can do to harden our schools, but not make them a prison." - Patriot One Technologies @patriot1tech is your solution @marcorubio and @NelsonForSenate #GunViolencePrevention
#fascist #traitor
Fake news
You’re a joke!
BAN ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS
Wasted 4 hours Senator!  Only needed 4 minutes to develop common sense gun control plan:
1. Ban assault weapons
2. Mandatory background checks - all guns sales nationwide 
3. Rescind PLCAA
4. Stop taking NRA blood money donations
What's "School Hardening?"
Lástima que lo que uno lee no sea suyo propio sino del encargado de poner al día su cuenta Tweeter ...
Thank you for being proactive! May I also suggest we focus on #prevention long before there are #redflags and a need for #threatassessment.

Errrrrr.....manual or .....

Senator Rubio, did the discussion include, "Banning Military Assault Weapons and limiting magazine size to five"
How many of these "experts" were NRA members?
Yes, of course, more guns in the schools.  Keep that NRA money flowing in, #VoteThemAllOut
How much #NRABloodMoney was circulating around that room to make sure you do zero things to stop gun violence? #hypocrisy #ResignNow
“School hardening”... ??? oh for f**ks sake ...not fooling anyone, you’re still a shill for the diabolically misguided NRA.
Please stop wasting taxpayers’ money! 

80%+ of the country wants gun control. 

Americans (whom you are supposed to represent) don’t need more talk, we need action.
A lot of very white “experts”
Need church hardening,  movie house hardening,  night club hardening, concert hardening.... etc. etc. Or assault weapons softening.
@SamanthaJoRoth was there covering for @BN9 and @MyNews13
.@marcorubio & @SenBillNelson  hosted a school safety roundtable in Washington on Wednesday -- I speak with two parents of Parkland victims who are calling for national school safety standards. Check out my story…

SALUDOS DESDE VENEZUELA SENADOR
Integrity - The quality of being honest & having strong moral principles.

Obviously, Marco Rubio has difficulty w honesty & has weak moral principles since he has ZERO integrity.

Just look at Marco’s statements concerning the NASA nomination & compare them to Obama nominations.
Aside from yourself, which one of these older white people around that table were from the @nra???

Hardening schools.  Whats next, churches,  offices, movies or grocery stores?  At what point do you feel imprisoned and stop adapting to the gun problem engulfing this country?
You need to stop this hack of a nomination from happening MARCO!
Twiddle this Title Hypocrite...Since the NRA are a major contributor to your campaign, you just wasted everyone 4hrs.Putting #GUNS before people and using the 2Amd as an excuse. Same with SUPPORTING YOU #DictatorMadeInUSA in #Honduras & going against the #Dictator of #Venezuela
This is very important
#LittleMarco, #PresidentRottenCrotch thanks you
But you're on the NRA payroll at $3.3M
Lying hypetcrit
funny, that looks like a u-shaped table.
how much was on the cheque from the NRA?
enough to have a medium outburst of sweat, I suppose
you better wash your little hands little Mario
The biggest problem with partisan politics is how it blinds us. If what you want is solutions, and this obviously is the best way to keep our children safe, then why not support it? Why attack a bipartisan solution?
http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180417-what-would-happen-if-all-guns-disappeared …  Please read, share. #GunViolencePrevention #Sayfie
Marco, your morning bible quotes get more desperate sounding everyday. Somewhere in your greedy, sniveling, mixed up mind, you know what you're doing here is wrong. School hardening??? WTF, man???
Stop exploring and cancel assault riffles.. So full of BS! People are dying!!! @AC360 @amjoyshow @cnnbrk @davidhogg111 #VoteThemAllOut



Guns aren't just a school problem, they are America's obsession. We need to do better. Talk to constituents for a change. Town Hall!





WTF is school hardening?
This ad was approved by the NRA.
Mr. NRA says what?
Do U REALIZE how badly California hates Congressman Darell Issa? The writing of BILL after BILL to put innocent in courts RUINED HIS VERY NAME! Not only that he has been accused of using meth. And preying on children. Which his beloved good friend  vatican Arrested Child porn!
We won’t forget your #bloodmoney #wecallbs #VoteMarcoOut #littlemarco places #partyOVERcountry
Did you discuss why American culture has "evolged" to the point where hardening schools is normal discourse?   Where else in the world is that even considered?
4 hour roundtable on school safety: again, mostly old white men. Blah, blah, blah.
How would that help Pulse or Vegas?  Also, are you still taking NRA money?  We are watching.  #Sayfie
Agree. Gun reform is about more than just schools.
You are nothing more than an NRA puppet. You would not look a teenage student and tell him you will not accept blood money contributions from the NRA. Ban military assault weapons and high capacity magazines.
Yeah, let’s make every school like a fortress, instead of more restrictions on guns.
Nobody, including YOU - the NRA stooge - wants to address the 900 pound gorilla in the room - the need for gun reform to protect our kids and everyone else.  This is nothing but eyewash. NOTHING substantive will come out of this meeting to protect Americans.
If you think that Marco is protecting your children, ask him if he supporting the concealed carry reciprocity bill.
Why is an NRA stooge like you at the table? You know what needs to be changed you just refuse to do it. Your time is coming Little Marco.
Gun violence affects all sectors of society. Round-tabling with a bunch of older white men is not good enough.
Gun violence prevention. 

Which one of those three words do you think is the problem?

Stop taking NRA money and maybe your eyes will be opened.
After sitting through a 4-hour roundtable, did you learn enough common sense to just pass common-sense gun control legislation? No? Well, I didn't think so. If you had that much common sense, you wouldn't have endured a 4-hour roundtable, you NRA toady...
Let's say that yes, we do need to do whatever you think "common sense gun legislation" is. Does that mean that, say, getting suicidal kids mental health support isn't good? If not, why object to a forum discussing that with experts? The Dems there seemed to think it was useful.

#GunViolencePrevention is not limited to just schools. Schools are just one venue, and a symptom of the problem where many are easy to take down. Discussions should be about all public/private gathering areas, including, but not just, schools.
You criticize others for their efforts but here you are pretending to save the day with your sole agenda. Turning schools into prisons. EFF PSs- this is slavery. Parents should have the choice then. You better believe my child is not going to a PRISON! A$$ HAT!
You probably should have paid attention instead of tweeting bible verses.
Look at that. 
What kind of experts?
Look how well the black community is represented! 
Sheesh.
Indian? Hispanic? Poor? Young?  Same shit different day.
Thank you so much Senator Rubio your support. We look forward to continue working with you on this matter. #SafeSchoolsForAlex #MSDstrong
And then Rubio, you’ll do whatever the NRA wants u to do!

But nothing about making it more difficult to buy assault rifles?  Good start Marco but not good enough.
You’ll run yourself ragged fighting the symptoms of gun violence rather that attacking the disease. You’re not very intelligent. Is that a prerequisite for being a member of the @GOP these days?
More smoke and mirrors.....
“Round table” in this pic...is as accurate as saying you’re going to act on anything!
Ok. 
And what about when kids go to movies, a concert, a club to dance? 
What about when they aren’t at school?
Don’t you think you are also responsible for their safety during off-school hours?

Oh-but that would entail going against the NRA wouldn’t it.
Anything but giving up those NRA dollars you mean.

Then you went out and blew the head of the NRA didn't you? Come on and admit it you little shit. #rubioblowsthenra
SCHOOL HARDENING??
BAN ASSAULT RIFLES YOU WUSSY NRA PAID BITCH
It is sad and disheartening to even think there is a need to 'harden' schools!! No weapons of war on the street would mean less AND less catastrophic mass shootings! Of course, that's not on the agenda. Too much testosterone in the room!!!
If you think that table is round, you better add some high school students to your invitees
Why not offer thoughts and prayers?
You religious dingbat

$1.05
Ban assault weapons. First step. Very easy. Oh that’s right the NRA owns you too.
Completely avoiding the fact there are way too many guns owned by way too many idiots yet you want them to have even more.
School hardening...what a nice term. I guess you're not talking about the curriculum getting harder. May I suggest rolls of razor wire and scary dogs.
TOWN HALL?
So I count 1 black male 7 females and 16 white old rich men. One I know collects millions from the terrorist org nra that supports the killing of Americans with weapons of mass destruction. Now we want gun control and weapon bans. Then maybe America will think your serious. Fake
Gun control not among them NRA poster boy.
Did the #NRA give you permission for this meeting @marcorubio? Or was it allowed as long as you continue to do nothing afterward? #Enough #NeverAgain #NRABloodMoney
How about safety in parks & churches & movie theaters....? We gonna 'harden' the whole world? And when's your Town Hall in Hillsborough County?
June never, 2049
Selling guns to kids
Voters will judge the productivity. #ActionNotWordsAndTweets
Yeah. TAKE EVEN MORE NRA MONEY, Killah.


Fancy! A round table. As in "look how hard we are working on this. See? Everyone see?" or you could just listen to the kids. Way to look like your doing something all the while keeping your 3 mil tucked safely away.
Your owners the NRA are not going to be happy that you used the word Gun and Violence together.  You #NARBloodMoney envelope may be a little lighter this week.
“School hardening” you mean turning schools into glorified prisons’
Good job. More of these discussions with all views included is a good thing.  As a life long Republican I have shifted to support reasonable gun laws and will vote on that issue. But all voices need to be heard.
I’m sure your NRA evaluators will give you high marks and reward you appropriately. #NotMyGOP
Did you report back to the @NRA yet?
You have sure had a plate of  handed to you with all of this.  Keep the faith.
Gun safety starts with super vetting and removing guns from the hands of crazies, terrorists and felons. We need a comprehensive federal database and licensing of all legal qualified gun owners. We need to also track how many guns they own & how much ammo they are buying.
How about banning assault weapons? Let’s start there.
Do you remember there names?
We’d all be safer if every man, woman and child had a small thermonuclear weapon. Because the only way to stop a bad guy with a thermonuclear weapon is a good guy with a thermonuclear weapon. #nrabloodmoney
you've got to be kidding, when you are an NRA darling, I think you lose any credibility to talk on this issue,  you spout scripture but you are not an honest man
Good ! Keep it going we need Common Sense gun laws.
PS it would really help if you stop taking money from the NRA that would prove your commitment to this effort
You and productive don’t go together.
Did you decide to ban assault rifles or students?
That table is not round
So two months later nothing concrete has happened except this bullshit meeting on a tactic that will accomplish nothing. Looks like the NRA and their shills have won again
Enough is enough how much taxpayer money has gone to support the president's private club that is so an ethical enough is enough and investigation needs to be opened

NO RECONOCER AL SUCESOR CUBANO,NO FUE ELECTO POR EL PUEBLO.
Just ban AR15 style weapons.  Now. Isn’t that easy to say?
Do you think guns should be in this discussion ?

You need to ask for Scott Pruitt resignation
Of course you would like this.  It doesn’t address the issues of common sense gun controls which would ruin your A+ rating with the NRA.  #GunReformNow #GunContolNow
Any "expert" in 4 hour discussion mention removing military style assault rifles, extended ammo clips from legal sell? Regulating gun show transactions? Universal no loophole background checks? Registering/licensing/insuring firearms? Were participants allowed to say GUN?
Was NRA rep(s) at this meeting? ANY legitimate discussion about school and other public safety related to gun violence MUST include discourse on the GUN and it's prominent place in the GUN violence equation. GUN is the common denominator.
First, no, no "NRA reps." Several Democratic lawmakers and parents of Sandy Hook/Parkland victims, though.
Second, I only saw part of it but in that part they discussed red flag laws and how underage kids get guns (from their parents).
Third, while I would be interested in hearing criminology experts testify on the efficacy of, for example, assault weapons bans, not *every* hearing must discuss them. Connecting suicidal kids with mental health support is a good thing to talk about regardless.

When government cites experts, that’s when I get nervous.
Talk about everything the NRA allows you to talk about. 17 deaths in Parkland are your fault. #NRABloodMoney
#BlueTsunami
Attributing guilt to someone who did not pull the trigger is political and disgusting. Your mob lynch mentality is repulsive to everyone who understands accountability and the rule of law.
Does "school hardening" involve giving small bats to teachers and students for defense?
More good would have been served had you spent 4 hours at the range.
How much money have you accepted from @NRA?
 NRA lackey
I trust a vow to never take another cent from the NRA and banning semi-automatic weapons were the main topics of the “school hardening” discussion. 
#GunReformNow

A bunch of old white men and a couple of token women? This picture DOES NOT reflect America. It reflects the GOP.
Stop with the LIES!!! 1) Adam Lanza was DENIED a gun. The firearms he used were stolen. 2) Trump did NOT remove the law that forbids those who have be found to be mentally ill from buying ANY TYPE of a firearm. 18 U.S. Code § 922 (g)(4) is still on the books today.
Such utter bs. Obama took away people's 4th Amendment Rights. Even the ACLU was against Obama's UNCONSTITUTIONAL act.
Why can't you contact a constituent. I had a problem with SSA, not paying in near 2 years, a SSA dr has stated disabled and still SSA has not paid. Now in Federal Court waiting for a court date. Your staff has my number. I deserve a call back
Rubio is one of the fiscal 'conservatives' that just stole a Trillion dollars from the US Treasury
für jeden kommt die zeit fürs abtreten
so NOW you think it's a good idea ....
 The folks in your district deserve better representation than you . The Senate requires better than you.
 #RubioHasToGo #VoteBlue #Vote
Ban AR15's
Why?  Handguns are the more common weapon. Why just the one simi-auto model. Why not all?  The problem with this thinking is it helps no one. It’s more complex than just access to one model of gun. Don’t you think?
ACTION TALK IS CHEAP
I don't see anyone with an AR15 at the table. Wtf?
And nothing will come from it.
I trust banning semi-automatic weapons was the consensus.
NRA Shill.
I don’t speak Russian. Don’t drink Vodka. Wake up GOP. Our President is a Russian Asset. #DumpTrump. TrumpTreason. #Resistance
best practice is gun control...70 percent of us want it  you are ignoring us because you want NRA money....
Here’s an idea: stop taking NRA money.
So stupid. The NRA and access are not the issue. Your ideas help no one. You don’t care. You just want political points.
We need #GunReformNow
