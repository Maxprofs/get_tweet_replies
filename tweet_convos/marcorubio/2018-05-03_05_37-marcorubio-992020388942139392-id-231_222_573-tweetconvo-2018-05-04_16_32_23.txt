You are absolutely right! ccp is the root of all evil and slowly corroding the world! 
They are not only damaging the world trade system but also the world civilization!

They won’t behave unless they are being punished hard enough! such as the regime is changed!
Take look at Huawei’s flagship phone which is a shameless iPhone X copy!
Why does America let that happen day after day?
Absolutely right, need to form a solid front with EU, Canada, Japan and others to apply just about the same set of sanctions against China and in doing so, China is like a dead fish in the water, if they fight, they get wrecked. @marcorubio
the first congratulation your 1000% right decision; then, your US should know, don't offer any chance for a long-term-liar, Chinese IT researchers are the tech thieves, one can't except.
join the civilised family or to be the enemy of the civilised family, there will be no middle way can be existed. flourish or perish, it's up to the stupid Emperor.
Maybe you can only work on one thing at a time. That’s why you’re not President
you are right  ，Chinese communist party fall down will make Asian continent a  much better place，this will break North Korea，Russia，Veintnam so easily ， middle east evil regimes will lose their power of controling Internet 。
What about that tax bill you so readily voted for @marcorubio? You don’t care about people. You only care about votes and your @NRA rating so they’ll give you money. I’m one of the constituents you don’t care about.
Stop undermining POTUS.
美国这么做就对了，所有高等知识，共匪全部是跟美国学的，高等教材都是直接copy美国。
共匪的长项是说谎忽悠杀人灭口洗脑、贪污、喝百万一瓶的酒、肏文工团戏子的屄。共匪嘴巴和鸡巴都很忙，没空研究。
美国百年的辛苦研究，共匪偷窃来是分分钟的事情，共匪还得意地说共匪研发比美国快得多。
偷确实快
First thing first. China is absolutely the first priority. To what extent the European countries will kick China’s ass will depend on our resolve and determination, and the results of our fight against the rogue regime.
You are absolutely right! ccp is the root of all evil and slowly corroding the world! 
They are not only damaging the world trade system but also the world civilization!

They won’t behave unless they are being punished hard enough! such as the regime is changed!

Thanks Senator Rubio for being on top of the China issue. I appreciate you looking out for the USA god bless you.
China is the most dangerous enemy to US. Probably worse than Russia, Iran, and N Korea. Never underestimate its degree of evil, never been fool by its deception. CCP spies every where, especially in NY & CA, especially in Chinatowns. Wolves are among us. Wake up American 
Yes, You are right, CCP is first enemy!Please let more and more people understand, Do not just looking their money, our life is more important than their money.
Senator Rubio, Sasha Gong aka Xiaoxia Gong (formerly VOA empolyee) made false testimony to help Chinese regime get MFN after the 1989 incident. Look at QA after the hearing

#rookie
It's horrible. An anti-democratic, anti-Christian, anti-Islamic country that used the world's compassion for them, the world gave them money and technical assistance, but they supported the terrorists and intended to fight the human race
So losing the entire Chinese soybean market huh
naive ,do you think China affords to lose American soybean market,American soybean is rather cheap ,which hardly can be found elsewhere.
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity It's DISTURBING that Mitch McConnell and CSchumer have had vast private interests in China, have THEY and all their cronies caused & kept the China Surplus for personal profit??  ALL of Congress is totally CORRUPT!
Great move! Open the Chinese market and fight against the evil communism regime.
God bless America!
You're NOT President Rubio so stop trying to be one or to tell the President what he should do. Trump was talking about China for 40 years while lawmakers like you got wealthy off of making bad deals for the US with EVERYONE!
@marcorubio What's your feeling when saw so many Chinese reply your tweet?
I would suggest that you support reciprocal tariffs to all of trade partners. If they have tariffs on our steel and aluminum products we should match it plus any subsidies.
Thank you. You guys doing great .
Are you going to tell trump to stop? I doubt it since you have no balls to speak up.
@realDonaldTrump is the one who has put all this in motion. He KNEW #China was our biggest problem & campaigned on China issues! He has confronted China from day 1 of his administration! Now you are taking swipes at @POTUS & acting lk you have some new idea?
Only after the Chinese network is free. Trade can be free. The network is the key.
Monica Lewinsky mocks Rubio over intern tweet @CNNPolitics  Your lame attempts of having an acutal opinion while talking out of both sides of your mouth are just SAD!  Stay in your lane and try just once  for communicating one solid opinion with out checking the wind # waffle
Whatever lil Marco...you ain’t gon’ do shhhhhhhhh
No senator! Later is why we voted for Trump and not YOU!
You are the most conscious American. China are fooling the whole world. EU,Japan ,Korea,even Russia ,all the eastern countries should get together and toward China.
No, right now the focus needs to be on banning AR15 type weapons and stopping NRA bought legislators like yourself from killing more by your support for NRA to "buy into your agenda" (buy your vote). Stuck till 2022 but will always remember your answers to #MSDSTRONG students!

This is the typical swamp response.  Don’t ask EU to drop their fight. Just ask the US to drop its fight and let EU and Asia continue to fight us.  Why not be a leader for the US and say “It’s time for EU and Asia to drop its fight with the US and focus on China”
Your beloved president atracked the eu right  if Eu breaks a lot of European country's will go with China Hungary had made this in this week clear b3cause no trust to USA well done
Hungarys close relationship with China started long before Trump.  Ignoring history to point out how much you hate someone is not effective.  If you believe that the EU is going to break trade with the US and supplement it with China that is just partisan wishful thinking
Latin America needs to repair their economy, drop the peso and change their currency Into dollar's. Screw the help from the USA.
Marco, u need to get use to the fact that u r absolutely IRRELEVANT n ur gonna lose ur seat....i am one of ur constituents n have no faith in anything u say....u r just as much a lier as ur boss, the pig in chief..its rubbing off on u sir.
Network freedom is the spatial basis of trade freedom.
All countries that have justice should unite to completely overthrow the CCP's tyranny! Support the United States! Support Trump President's decision!
Tariffs on Chinese goods won't work either.  How about investing in American manufacturing, instead of giving tax cuts to the wealthy?  We can't compete in Steel because our factories are ancient and obsolete.
CCP has declared a societal war against the rest of the world.  The sooner the rest of world wakes up, the sooner existing frameworks (e.g. WTO, UNCLOS) need teeth in enforcement. PRC understands only strength and force. No more playing nice. CCP is autocratic revisionist!
Enjoyed your appearance on Tucker Carlson. Keep up the good work.
Saw your interview on Tucker & totally agree! So HOW about we KNOCK OFF this RUSSIAN BS & get to work on reining in OUR REAL THREAT What you and OTHER members of Congress are trying to do to OUR President is a DISGRACE Time for Mueller, Rosenstain and quite frankly SESSIONS to go
You are so right
Rubio with your vote to pass the taxes reformed bill, you and the rest of the GOP and Trump have put the middle and poor class down the dumpster. All to enriched the rich people. You know this to be true. Also you are busy enriching yourself from the NRA bribes.  Kids are dying.
With far-sighted vision, without destroying the communist evil code, civilization will eventually be savaged by barbarism.

Totalmente de acuerdo con su planteamiento Senador, y admiro su posición también hacía vzla.
President knows his plan for the end game. He is in the White House not you. Naples FL voter
At lot of European country's say after trumps speech about Eu that if the eu breaks they follow china because  they don't trust USA anymore you should pray 3u don't falls down thanks to helping brexit and other eight wing party's in Europe or you lose many allies
If they trust China. They will get wrost situation same as US.
It will be a complete fool to trust China on anything. Millions and millions Chinese die just because they trusted the CCP government
I'm with you on this one senator.
The bible Jesus is an infinite torturer devil mass murderer devil. Christians are so brainwashed they cannot even recognize that infinite torture and the mass murder of the human race (flood) are WRONG.

We're gonna vote you out little Marco.
Any statement on American prisoners in North Korean labor camp transfer to Hotel??? Can America get your thoughts please!
He never should have gotten into the fight to begin with. You can’t take “business nd corporate skills” and apply them to trade with a country.  Especially someone like Trump.
Exactly Ms. Senator! You're definitely on the right track. It is absolutely necessary to work as global partners,friends and allies in a cooperative way together, to be able to face the challenges of today's world. (like China,Iran,Russia etc.)


Republicans voted to add Trillions to the Debt to appease their purchasers and make the future citizens have to clean up the Republican Traitors in Office mess yet again#Reagan did it and it failed#HW Bush did it and it failed#GW Bush did it and it failed#
The millionaire & billionaire Pedofile Club IS OUT OF CONTROL!
I kinda agree
If Marco Rubio is serious about addressing growing income and wealth inequality, then he’ll heed his own words and create a tax system that really does invest in working families.
Yet he’s your guy.
Can you, Senator Rubio, name any time in history that protectionism and tariffs actually had the desired result?  Do you remember the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which was a major cause of the Great Depression?  Trade deficits are meaningless.  Budget deficits, not so much!!

35 over  politicians have signed the @noNRAmoney pledge in the past week @marcorubio would you like to be the first Republican to sign?
When's your Town Hall in Hillsborough County?
Little Marco trying to detach from Trump train
But if you had been President you’d have accepted anything from the world traders.  You wouldn’t have stood up for America. So be quiet and allow Trumps magic. You’re like all the other haters.
How is Mark Warner a good guy when he is caught being a part of the effort to destroy @realDonaldTrump ? No Mr Rubio @MarkWarner is a scumbag who is panicking bc his name is all over the press.
Your true never trump blood is bleeding through! Trump supporters are going to make you regret your anti-Trump stance. You can’t hide it anymore we know where you stand. Big mistake

It’s hard to grow back a spine Sir, when you already proven that you have none.
Hi Marc, Ohhla,that is not the Trump Admin.fault, the problem is why the former Presidents Administations did not manage to raise these taxes by 2 % per year,that would have been the right way, 16 years Dems,and you see what happened!And  again, it is not the Trump Admin.fault!
I’m really Sorry about the rejected spine surgery
are you going to remain silent.
https://www.heritage.org/trade/report/tariff-reform-needed-boost-the-us-economy …
why aren't you in his corner? Why aren't you making noise over this unfair treatment of a republican president? Be vocal!!!
Really EU is standing up and you give us a left wing site to prove your point? China was been taking advance of the US long enough stand w/ @POTUS or hunt another job come election time
In Trump we trust.  Not you.  He’s changed the country for the better.  You tried to stop his reign.  Bottom line:  you dont get to stray from Trump policies- he is always right and he must be not only respected but bowed down to. Youre either all aboard the Trump train or a Dem!
You will be saying something different tomorrow after one of Trumps errand boys gives you a call. Be a hero.
Rubio sounds like a closet Democrat. President Trump knows what he's doing. That's why we elected him and NOT you.
Some of Our allies (friends) have NO qualms about lecturing, cajoling into pacts or even taking advantage of US generosity..a TRUE friend (ally) would be FAIR! Don't drop SQUATE untill trade is FAIR, Senator.
Rubio, how little you know China. Chinese are businessman trader and understand fair trade for 5000 years. For the past 70 years China is not at war with anyone, bullets cost money. For penance, Rubio, eat in a chinese restaurant daily for a month. @TrumpSuperPAC @PressSec
Hold your horses big guy. Caving early has got us here.
OR your focus could be on impeachment! That would really help!
He doesn’t know history. He should look up the Hawley Smoot Tarrif Act. It plunged the world into the Great Depression
why would your potus stand on the steps of air force one, say he had no knowledge of a payment to Stormy, then turn around and say oh wait I  did...but it wasn't campaign money it was mine nothing to say on that? you are all complicit
Trump Tax Cuts were a big nothingburger. US companies have plowed more than $246 billion into stock buybacks this year, according to the research firm Birinyi Associates. That's up 31% from the same point last year.
Amen! Thank you for easing away from being a trump apologist. I do hate what you all did to our healthcare. Up 40%. Already double my mortgage.
@marcorubio .. You’re one little pandering man. It’s why you lost to Trump! You represent the establishment who are trying to take down @POTUS .  Americans who voted for Trump desperately wanted a leader who would stop establishment’s attempt to destroy our USA. #TickTock you POS
MINUTE ONE: Marco Rubio says something honest about something being wrong.
MINUTE FIVE: Marco Rubio gets blowback from GOP-NRA.
MINUTE TEN: Marco Rubio walks comments back.
MINUTE THIRTY: Marco votes for thing he said was wrong.
Sen. Marco Rubio is walking back some of the criticism he leveled against the new Republican tax law earlier this week https://politi.co/2FBh7Rz  
Except that article is wrong. Rubio didn't walk it back. His original Economist interview wasn't as negative about the tax bill as the Economist made it sound, and his op ed isn't as positive about the bill as Politico makes it sound. He said the same things both times.
And what he said was that the bill was an overall positive better than nothing but it had major things wrong with it. People think that position is impossible because they are dumb partisans who can't handle nuance.
Later is not the answer. You could learn a great deal from Trump.  America 1st
I know you can’t change what President Trump is saying about what he is going to do. Don’t you think he is stirring up dangerous problems such as Iran and China? I can’t understand why all Republican back him in these endeavors much less his base.
很简单，奥巴马不懂克林顿不懂川普总统懂
You know what @marcorubio maybe it's you guys that should just drop @realDonaldTrump You can't cleanup the s*it storm he has created until he is no longer President. #ImpeachTrumpNow

Good job
Go back to bed Little Marco nobody is listening to you. Just another Republican Taliban grifter.
PERFECT
can not agree more
Don't understand you Marco!!!
Please pass the Daylight Savings Bill. That’s all we care about from you.
Sorry I disagree, I have traveled all over the world and our products are being taxed unfairly. Instead you should help the @realDonaldTrump with negotiations in Latin America instead of speaking out against him #Fairtrade
Complicit, Sen Rubio. You helped get him into office. You made your bed. You made your choice. Damn the American people. @GOP = Hypocrisy, Greed and Winning at all costs, even if that means sending a pedophile to DC. You/your pals=traitors to our nation. Congrats on your success.

Dude you must be dumb as a box of rocks. The tariff fight is WHY they are ready to work with us against China! Get a clue!
He’s treating us like Democrats treat their libtard Lemmings.
一粒老鼠屎弄坏一锅粥，中共就是那一粒老鼠屎，所以中共才是重点。
One mouse ferces spoils a pot of porridge. The Chinese Communist Party is that mouse ferces, so the CCP is the key.
No sir looking the other way is over for our country. We now have a President with a back bone!!!
"You've got to generate economic growth because growth generates revenue. But you also have to bring spending under control." - Marco Rubio -  The problem is, giving $1.5 trillion to the wealthy is SPENDING.
"we can work out our differences with them later"  
diversion away from the russia investigation.
Would they be doing this otherwise????
Is that legal though? I thought the WTO had strict most favoured nation provisions.
Tariffs are what bring them to the negotiating table.  To do otherwise is Obama's way.
America will be dropping you liddle Mario, the fat lying #FakePresident and the @NRA
It is the tariff fight that got the EU to this point.
Wrong but if eu breaks already some smaller eu country's make clear they follow China because no trust to USA
Marco; who is a better negotiator, you or Trump. Learn from him, please!
This and many reasons his lying to the American people from air force 1 is why he should be impeached!
The focus needs to be on the impeachment of the ass sitting in the oval. He is an embarrassment to our nation around the world. The gop should be ashamed for allowing this fiasco to continue. Greed and power is all the gop cares about. The citizens are being raped by greed
They're only ready to fight back because we threw the 1st punch at China.   They don't lead on this.  If they want us to help, then its time for the EU to let Brexit happen.  Enough of their Globalist agenda.
This just in...your orange dotard has no clue. You’re a worthless shill and continues to allow the madness to continue. Fail.
Perhaps so!!
why did you take over $3,300,000 from the NRA?
Don’t worry about it he will be impeached soon enough so we’ll be back to free trade in short order.
Yeah and you have been so right about everything Trump LMAO we should definitely stop listening to you because if we had Hillary would be president today
That is the thing. whether by the non EU country investment in Europe the growth would have been calibrated with huge job opportunities or they take the technical knowhow of Europe's firms, this is not beyond controversy.
Sorry-I have lost respect for your opinion over your recent comments about the tax cut, you need to talk to some working people to see how much the tax cut has helped some of us.
Rubio does not object to the personal tax cut. If you have kids, Rubio wanted to cut your taxes *more.*
Too late to change topics.
So great
Sounds like follow the leader to me. 
Pssst. China stopped buying US soybeans. Dead stopped. Think about what’s going to happen in Midwest during midterms. Whose bitch will you be in January?
U r such a coward, without vision...thank God for the @realDonaldTrump who is willing to fight for trade balances and even dominance.....
Little Marco your opinions are so baseless. Our president, Donald Trump is addressing all trade issues. Get behind our president and watch us all have better lives.
Sit down little marco and let the man do his work. All you and your rinos " elites " do is make it harder for the potus to get it done. Obstruct anyway you can.
But what about MAGA, Winning, and #AmericaFirst? We MUST slap tariffs on ALL our enemies, all those foreigners because They Are NOT America! That will achieve #MAGA and result in the Highest Ratings and Winning for ALL Americans. You are crazy if you don't support all tariffs.
Trump isn’t going to be around for long. Time for Plan B.
Rubio the tax cuts have helped many small businesses. 66% of Americans dream of owning their own company. Small businesses in USA screwed by Obama admin. Now we have hired new employees and given bonuses.
Rubio you like Dems are disconnected with tax paying Americans!
Yeah , but what will be your position tomorrow
Are you referring to yesterday's tax bill comment saga? Because the final evidence on that was that he was consistent, and other people willfully refused to understand him.
This is where lying gets you
Senator's point of view is correct! The U.S. government now needs to unite those countries with minor contradictions to deal with powerful CCP groups that are threatening the U.S. and the world at large.
Later? That’s always the answer from RINOs and so-called Elites in DC. Time to put #AmericaFirst
You are 100% complicit with this morally unfit Trump Administration. You cant thread the needle by pretending you are both with and seperate from them. #disappointment
Mr. Rubio, the rep must due wht the dems do. Unite solidly! Supprt the @potus and push his agenda. Pelosi and her cohorts supported obama and didn’t back stab him. Doesn’t Trump deserve that kinda unity from repubs?  Sir, be on the right side of history! Support your President
Poor "little Marco" has no credibility.
Marco knows nothing about this topic, is just trying to tweet about foreign policy to fool people into thinking he knows something about foreign affairs. So many of us wish he kept his promise not to return to the Senate.
More and more people know the essence of the government of Communist Party of China and fight against it!
Enough is enough- you have lost all credibility- this entire administration and is a complete and total "crap show"....GET A SPINE AND STAND UP GOP- this is totally disgusting!!!  Shame on you all.
Pick and choose who sucks up the most. What a hypetcrit you are.
I know your worried about the parkland kids voting you out. but throwing Trump under the bus is not going  help your cause.
You had a chance to stand and do the right thing.
You had MANY chances to stand and do the right thing.
You NEVER choose the right thing.
Why? Seriously, Why?
Because he's been mentored by the RINOs.
It’s called multi-tasking.  He is handling multiple negotiations at once.  Politicians can learn something from businessmen
What a joke. You and Marco.
Again, what are you doibg for Florida specifically?
You don't think US trade policy affects Florida?
Beautiful
Stop enabling trump and end this craziness.
If our allies are truly our allies, they wouldn’t be taking advantage of us. The deficit with some of our allies is billions!
Stay out of it.  You don’t know about what you are talking about.
how about gun control? or the $3.3M hurt??? we will not let go before you work on the gun control or we will get you out of that position
Soro back...do not re elect...
@realDonaldTrump is right.

USA has been complaining about the lack of parity with EU tariffs through three presidents and the EU just walks away.
 The US tariff on EU cars is just 2.5% while the EU tariff on US cars is 10%.
Europe is not going to change that advantage willingly.
You see, that's why you're not the president. You dont have the spine to do anything real.
Go back to quoting scripture .. dude on so many things you are clueless to what Trump does that we like, one he fights , 2 he takes no bullshit 3 when people want to deal he will work a compromise and 4 china is a competitor , but so is Germany and other nations.
You must think that your constituents are blind fools, but we see you Marco.
But what would ensure the EU acts in the US's interests?
Let’s target to China government CCP, to be exact.
You are right. Real rival is China, watch and work together with Anglo-Saxon, EU allies.
Wait. You think that because we get along with a Country (our allies) we should let them take advantage of us in trade?

You also think that we should let China be at the bottom of a multi-nation dog pile in trade?

That’s not good policy. Neither of them.
I disagree. Too many things that require attention to restrict one self to tunnel vision. Later is not an acceptable position. Nothing wrong with multi-tasking.
China is not an ally and has the second largest economy set up to surpass our own. I'm on the side of that being the more important issue.
Do you really think all your tweets this morning about tariffs will deflect from the only story anyone is interested in?  This president lied to the American people!! No one cares about his philandering.  What is the common denominator with Nixon, Clinton and Trump.  They lied!!!
tariffs are the least of his problems at the moment,
hombre, he is facing court, impeachment and jail
So far POTUS has been right with all his decisions despite the naysayers. Your a smart man Congressman and my senator but my bet is with the President's strategy.
You should have kept your word and retired from the senate
Marco have you responded to Leonard Pitts ??
Heard you were buddying up with Bill Nelson
As usual, your about 3 years late. Read a Bible verse to us. Something about the meek shall inherit....
@GOP fools.
Marco even dares to speak.
You are so much a globalist mascot you’ve forever ruined your chances of ever being elected president. You need new advisors.
You got "no plan" Marco. 
Neither Republicans nor trump are capable of governing.
The GOP identity politics is now "Sex, Lies & Videotapes". Own it!
#VoteThemOut2018
Hey Marco, maybe you should start getting behind the many “wins” MAGA is having right now! .......to think you had my vote! Step up!!!!!
Yeah. Marco. You still supporting David Dennison?

Respectfully sir, I disagree that the EU will do ANYTHING about this beyond talk about (if they even do that much) and if they do, it will do so in as heavy-handed approach as possible. That said, I feel this tariff thing is more to scare other nations into making fairer deals.
Agree. This is what happens when your president can’t read the numbers on trade statistics or foresee the long-term consequences of his actions.
You win the award for the stupidest tweet of the day, genius.

It's not trade, it's theft.

They steal $200-500 billion from the USA alone.

Then there's the missiles and radar jamming they're installing on the Islands they invaded...

If we're heading to war soon, let's cut trade off completely.
"Ladies and gentlemen, China's intent is crystal clear. We ignore it at our peril," Harris said.

$200-500 billion annually lost to technology & IP theft by the Chinese government.
That's why you lost! Because you don't understand business. Or what the American ppl want. Stop the divide. Work with @realDonaldTrump maybe  you need to start on ground floor.
President Trump is perfectly capable of multitasking--even if you can't Marco
How long until you walk this back?  I bet 5 minutes after Don Dastardly shoots a tweet your way.
