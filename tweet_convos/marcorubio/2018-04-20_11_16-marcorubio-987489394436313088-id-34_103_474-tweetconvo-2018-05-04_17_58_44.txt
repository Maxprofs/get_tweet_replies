I'm pretty sure U R speaking 4 all the Hispanic ILLEGAL ALIENS/DACA/Coyotes/MS13. (No doubt about it).  Unlike here the Legal Latino Community Stands STRONG with Our Wonderful Sen. Rubio. #KeepAmericaGreat2020

And by "Tax Reform", Tim and Marco really meant finding ways to give their billionaire donors MORE taxpayer money and screwing the middle class. #Priorities
Did you and Marco talk about being owned by the NRA? Did you discuss your criminal leader? Did you discuss the wall? You are both tools of your financial sponsors and deep down you know it.
Classical verbiage of someone who refuse to accept these leaders are elected by people like myself who believe in conservative values.
You mean the #TaxScamBill
Details matter Senator.  You allowed your peers to line their pockets with tax payer dollars.
Was that your town hall?
Love this!
Did #DACADreamers come up at all? Asking for more than a million friends.
Yes because being American isn't good enough anymore
Maybe you should work to insure their safety and that of their families.  #Daca #ComprehensiveImmigration
Good to hear:) Tax reform is very important to everyone. I have plenty of friends in Mexico:) I met them @ Linkedin. They know me Marika.
Did you talk about how people with the lowest incomes are now supporting the wealthiest? #Hypocrites #ResignNow
Did you apologize to every one of those good people for your AWFUL voting record??
You’re sad Tim. You know you’re being used for the color of your skin, right?



New data shows the Trump administration has separated more than 700 children from their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4.…
In the first pic, it looks like you are the one doing all the talking while @marcorubio was chowing down.:)
Some  'talk' about people, some  are 'with' the people. How to go guys! Two of the best Republican Conservatives we have reaching out to the people who need it. #MAFGA (Make America Feel Good Again)
There was no tax reform. The last real tax reform was authored and passed by the brilliant Tip O'Neill. What the Republicans passed was a TAX SCAM. A SCAM that enriched the wealthy and corporations permanently. It did little to benefit the working class.
Overwhelmed? By all 8 of them? BAHAHAHA
Didn't know there were so many billionaires in the Homestead Mexican American community.

#GOPTaxScam
You mean #TaxScam...  We will be lucky, if we avoid a *world wide* recession within the next 2 years, with the tax policies of the “stable genius” in chief and you GOP cons.
Please don’t forget about Puerto Rico, Senator.
