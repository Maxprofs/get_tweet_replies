Globalism is:

Free Trade.
Open Borders.…
Senator if your version of #americanconservatism involves taking healthcare access from tens of millions, ignoring climate change & gun control while pursuing inhumane immigration policies then well done. Conservatism should not equal Trumpism. What happened to you?
So your plan then is in order to appease Trump supporters all of those that now oppose Trump will be ignored and treated like second class citizens. Trump has been more divisive than any president in history any Rubio...you are complicit in his hatred and bigotry.
Using guns like toys & talking about machine gun bacon? Vilifying women like Hillary Clinton & Nancy Pelosi?

GOP antics don't fix roads, bring better heathcare, help for families devastated by drugs, make better jobs or higher wages

#BlueWaveComing2018
Tedious Cruels is a joke.
Can you be anymore embarrassing? What a total waste of a Senator you’ve become. The lackey for Trump. Little Marco is now a kiss ass to Trump. How low will you go?
Guess who said this on June 9, 2016: "Trump is unfit for the presidency and cannot be trusted with the nation’s nuclear arsenal." (hint, it was you Marco)
This is what is wrong
I suspect if you take Bremmer’s thesis only as a “See, I was right!” reinforcement to your current one-sided path, you’ve missed the point.
Senator, of course good ideas don't belong exclusively to liberals. I'm troubled by the "all immigrants are saints" crowd, but more troubled by those who use flawed logic and ignorance to demonize immigrants and trade agreements. Legit concerns don't guarantee smart policy.
Tariffs? Pulling out of agreements that destroy our credibility? Doesn't tweet about the hero at the waffle House? Please spare me.
So what you are saying is that I need to sit down and shut up because I am not part of their "American conservatism?" And what they have to say is more important than what I have to say?
I am a #florida #voter Mr. Rubio, and I matter.
Got it. Don't dismiss those whose driving animus is racial division, war on the poor and sick. Don't you have a Bible verse for that?
this transformation by u is sad yet terrifying, spoiler alert election turnout will never be as low as 2016 after Trump happened. You are hedging the wrong bet to ‘recreate yourself’ politically.
^ this, rather than being his own man it seems Rubio has decided to cater to those who think conservatism should be about White grievance politics for the sake of staying in office. He’s become a hack. Where’s his dignity?
While President Trump didn’t create America’s divisions, he exacerbated them. Additionally his continuous use of overt and subtle racist remarks have further reinforced racism in America. Worse yet, Senators have provided little to no rebuke. #Complicit
ARE YOU CRAZY? But a new study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, argues that a segment of these voters was motivated partly by a far less righteous cause: to protect their own dominant status in American culture and politics.
In other words, backlash from a black president.  
#DontOverThinkBigotry
Tariffs are the anti-thesis of free trade.
No tariffs just possibilities and getting the attention of others who take advantage of US
Tariffs are solely taxes paid by american consumers and corporations. Domestic producers raise their prices to approximate the cost of tariffed imported goods.
True but none imposed yet.
Pretty obvious that you’re positioning to sweep up the Trumpets when Trump goes bye bye...I’d ask you to stick to your principles but I don’t think you have any besides “get and stay elected.” But I’ll warn you...the Trumpets don’t like you and never will Marco. Give up on them.
The Democrats are forced to sit by the sidelines as Trump's reckless agenda howls over any real analysis or discussion. He can't even read a brief on National Security, yet we are to believe he or his lackeys will consider the implications of their actions? These actions hurt ALL
We'd be more than happy to discuss this with you at a Town Hall in Hillsborough County.
Trump was a fluke. Get over it. 

By the time you two are done flipping it'll be time to flop back.
Nothing a sellout like you can teach us.
Globalism and free trade will happen with or without us. We should be leading the charge and coming out on top, not hiding in fear in the corner. Your way of thinking will set us back decades and we will lose our place at the table.
^ this 
Really begging for election funding, or just in the mood to kiss donnies ass?

The Republican plan for family leave would destroy your Social Security benefits
SCUM
Conservatism? You guys just added $1.5 trillion to our national debt with the majority going to the rich permanently and you’re not finished yet, you want to build a $25 billion wall and another $1.5 trillion for infrastructure! That’s real conservative!
Guess we know where you stand (for now, at least). How does it feel to sell your soul?
Re-read it, #Zippy, and recognize that extremes from BOTH sides are the issue.

Pointing out ONE side makes everything worse. It is the definition of The Problem.

Wow.
cc @comfortablysmug @allahpundit
Rubio 3.0 will be a perfectly calibrated populist nationalist. The Rubio Wall will be 30 feet high!
So shall we all pretend Trump is not a globalists? To quote Abe: You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.
RUBIO...............Doing his best FOR TRUMP
There are about 5 million Trump supporters. That’s all. The rest of the people that voted for Trump are seeing the light. Any Repu could beat Trump in the next election. The “base” is a total myth hyped & propped up by Fake Fox News.
YOU HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS OR WORKING PEOPLE. RESIGN! YOU ARE AS A EFFECTIVE SENATOR AS A HOUSEPLANT.
I think we need a Democratic progressive their concerns.  You guys had eight years with Bush and did nothing, Obama was not much better.  Trump is a baffoon and you guys let him in the door.
Yeah, they were called the "Brown Shirts" in the late 30's.  Is that what you want this nation to become?  I really thought that you would at least what is going on - or are you that much of a party pundit.
The damaging of America is politicians who are bought and sold like you.
Not as damaging as those who lick his ass loyally.
#amiright @GOP ?
What do you do when not defending Trump
Wow please resign
Protective trade policy will not help the working class or any american.
Free trade works when you have fairness , not state controlled agendas to mercantile domination delivered by the State .. that era ended with the British empire .. now China is trying to create a modern version
Fellow Conservatives,
The Conservative Corner supports President Trump! His #1 priority is to “Protect & Defend The Constitution of The United States, against all enemies,Foreign & Domestic!
The Constitution is the priority for POTUS!
# The Conservative Corner.....
# MAGA!!!
No Bible verse?
Globalism  is the  same  of communist  want to destroy  capitalism...
Not helping businesses by releasing the H2B visas will be added to the list of people not supporting him anymore. There is a small window of time left to help all of us who are begging
Oh, okay. Here's the headline then: RUBIO says RACISTS are LEGITIMATE. 

We are not DISMISSING Trump supporters. We are fighting racism, bigotry, corruption, internal and foreign threats to our democracy, and social injustices. 

I guess you can't acknowledge that, Mr. Rubio.
So we should or should not condemn Nazi's and white supremacists?

Conservatism is based on free trade & markets & pursuit of globalism. Conservatives continue to push trickle down economics. GOP owns death of middle class in America.
Common sense says that Globalism is a stupid idea for everyone except elites looking for cheap labor pools. This, plus  Agenda 21, turns human beings into little more than hamsters. We aren't!!!
We need Democracy and Democrats in power. We need integrity not criminals like Trump or Pruitt. Intelligence not ignorance like DeVos and Carson #GOPTraitors #Complicit #GOPComplicit #BlueWave
Not as much as Trump supporters are damaging it. Racist, narcissistic, xenophobs tend to do damage, especially when armed


#gunreformnow stop taking #NRABloodMoney focus on helping your constituents, DACA and CHIP.
We also need GOP senators who actually stand up to Trump.
Study after study shows that many trump voters were driven by a tribalistic fear of losing status, not economic anxiety. How do you plan to address the "legit concern" of men and white people having less control over our country?
Ex.
"It used to be a pretty good deal to be a white, Christian male in America, but things have changed and I think they do feel threatened," the author of the study said https://nyti.ms/2KdtCGC 
The South won the Civil War....now the KKK is running the USA,,,
Conservatism can't. And never will. Flip the House. Flip the Senate. Flip the White House. And move on.


I’ve seen a Trump rally.  If that is what you call your constituency, I’ll pass.
The way I see it, this American Conservatism of which you speaks is a thinly veiled attempt to legitimise racism, misogyny, and xenophobia. IMO the Trumpists and Tea Party aren’t voting with their wallets, they are voting because they fear losing their dominance in society.
Trumps choleric rhetoric gives voice to their feelings of loss as they quickly become a cultural minority. Trumps bellicose ways give the Tea Party and the Trumpists the courage to act out in horrific ways.
Until you recognise that by flying along as a Trump lapdog you, too, contribute to the anger and divisiveness in this country nothing will change.
Trump calls Marco Rubio "little Marco", it is a term of endearment, king of like "hermanito"
Or “little Hitler “.
leave David Hogg alone
Hey, it's great giving other folks hard earned money to others.
It is called taxation and it is what you pay to live in a great society.
No, it’s called theft when it’s given to those that don’t earn it.
The only conservatism you support is #Establishment . You are just trying to appeal to Trump supporters so you can run for President again.
Trump is the main promoter of the growing divisions.  He hads taken us back to an era long ago gone.
If you cannot see it, YOU DO NOT WANT TO.
One of the few conservatives I considered in 2016, unfortunately pandering to the far right for self gain.
It's time that you went away now Marco, you're just embarrassing yourself.

You have no moral compass, no ethics and no pride.  

You have shown America what you are and it turns out that you are a weak, pitiful and sad little man with no concept of courage or integrity.

Resign
What about Trump supporters that dismiss, well, everyone else?
By ”address” you mean ”fuel”, Senator?

American youth are lost. 30 years ago culture differed by ONE MAJOR FACTOR - ALL held PATRIOTISM, and the Constitution in the highest regard.   Now? DISRESPECT REIGNS
We need conservatives that control spending, not liberals pretending to be conservative Republicans. Trillion dollar deficit and Tax plan hasn’t worked its way into the system yet.
Wow!
What create division right now are books like UsVsThem. Look at the title. It's meant to stir up more discord in this country. Labeling people and sorting them into simple groups like liberals and conservatives rather than Americans is what's divisive. And so are you just now.
The problem is people need help from the government to adjust to a new reality. They skills training and a safety net to sustain themselves in the meantime which is anathema to the current GOP.
Trump ran on a platform of Racism, homophobia, xenophobia & Islamaphobia.
Using scare tactics to make people vote for him. Lies & fear mongering at the expense of poor migrant workers that are trying to improve their lives by pick your vegetables. 
Hell yes Trump was devisive
You are out of your mind.  Kiss yer office goodbye
I don’t think there’s a lot of science behind that.  We are still believe in economy because of globalism and free trade. The lack of union jobs and decent pay for civil service workers has hurt the middle class.
The private market is subject to global competition, regulation, changes in tax laws, and basic market economics including shareholder returns. You and others who have spent years in government are immune to these pressures & are protected by gerrymandering and PACs. We r pissed
Can you knit?
Mister Rubio. Your, and the GOP policy prescriptions (tax scam bill) do the very thing that gives rise to the Trump base: bolster the donor class, gut the middle class, and decimate the social safety net. How have your policies EVER helped these folks?
Trumpito supports #maga #gop values:

Pussygrabbing
A long list of sexual assault allegations
Defend sexual abuser
Support child molester
Praising wife beater

Silently.

Plus as a #gop man he demands to control every vagina.
YOU SUPPORT THE CON MAN
the republicans divided the US. they fought Obama for 8 yrs.
I’m disgusted by the shallow, hate mongering horde. The subject was the over-arching policies that tends to favor the top 1%.
"F" off!
Their concern is that if the are not in power pushing America forward they try to test America,apart. Thats ,their concern
@marcorubio weren`t you a drug mule for your brother-in-law one summer ?
We should face reality: the post WWII, US-created and dominated liberal geo-political/economic order is over. Something new is emerging which is beyond any of our abilities to predict.
U r now a trump supporter. What r your concerns
Is this the beginning or another failed presidential run Marco?  Are u hoping the be the conservative American adressing trump supporters concerns.
I am an American patriot. A Marine Corps Veteran, Conservative Republican, free market Capitalist, and a Rubio supporter. 
You’re a Rubio http://supporter.It  takes a lot of stomach to be a Rubio supporter. Couldn’t you pick somebody a little less lame?
Read this.

Limited viewpoint.
Last I checked, dissenting against those who we believe are damaging our democracy is not, "damaging." It is indeed standing up when others lack the fortitude to do the same. (When they know good and well in their hearts things are backwards but have to answer to the NRA.)
Uh Marco you are not us hell your not even a Floridian your them .
Trump is dividing our country. All his BS slamming democrats, or calling people who kneel SOBs. Wether you want to admit or not, trump is responsible for dividing us right now!
The problem is that there is no current  #AmericanConservatism that doesn’t defend & enhance trump’s political views & goals.  #conservatism is not inherently bad but you are using it to defend an indefensible view.  We must “hear” his supporters but must show them a better way.
We need politicians that represent the public, not corporate donors
No the reason why there is a division in the US is due to the policies the Republican Party no longer stands for, and the constant lies, lastly the profit off people’s misfortune! #tellthetruth
He’s wrong Marco, we don’t need tRump supporters. His base is small and don’t reflect the majority. No one is above the law, not even a president.
Isolationism never works. It's failed many times.
Conservatives have never supported, or been interested in the working Americans. The American Conservative movement actually created a perpetual underclass, Working poor, to keep brown, black and Hispanic people down, but killed poor White folks dreams, too. Voila! Trump voters.
So you believe Alt right are fine people and those people who see Hispanics as breeders and invaders have a legitimate voice? 

#BlueWave2018
Coward
Trump calling the other half of the country Low Ratings Losers might continue to divide us, but it makes for #BiglyWinning. 
Go away.
Maybe the Trump supporters, the ones who openly display their racism, misogyny, and, in some cases, embrace Nazi hatreds are damaging the US?
Boosting education will reduce the "number of trump supporters"
American Conservatisiam's being redefined for the very weakness of the American Conservative to the extent we personally lose sight of a higher moral ground (based on "natural law"). Much evidence found in social  issues.

Ironically Joe Scarborough:
Globalism is yet a dog whistle and considering you represent Florida one would think you’d understand exactly what that dog whistle is but alas you’re too ignorant
You’re nothing but a globalist getting rich off donors like George Soros. RINO.
You are truly missing the point. This is an astronomical crisis.
#Trump #Russia #Mueller #USA #fakenews #Politics #TuesdayThoughts #MAGA?
Do YOU even listen to your constituents or just to the wealthy donors whose only interests seem to matter to you?
Just go back to being Trumps obedient puppy.
Trump won by conning people who aren’t bright enough to see it. And by being enabled by corrupt politicians.
just shut up and take your $3 million in "donations" from NRA and watch more people get killed. Good job senator
You are full of crap Marco! Trump is morally and intellectually unfit. You are a bought and paid for worm of a human! 
You need to go along side if Trump.
Stop distracting! Listen to the children! Ban the damn guns!!!!
Are you also addressing Democrats legit concerns? We feel you are not listening to us. Trump and the Trumpettes (regular people as well as morally broken heads of agencies like Pruitt) are deaf to anything we say. They hate us for ridiculous, conspiracy theory-laden reasons.
Start by doing something about immigration as the caravans will be coming across our borders. Politicians are sitting on their hands with this. Appalling.
Racism, bigotry and misogyny got Trump elected, not "legit concerns," and the Republican Party is already doing a darn good job of catering to those sentiments.
@mattgaetz Marco and Matt, as a FL1 voter, I ask, when will you pull your support for the VA nominee ? 
Bonus question : When will you pull support for Scott Pruitt ?
TRUMPS SUPPORTERS WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY TRUMP AND THE RUSSIANS WITH SOPHISTICATED CONSPIRACY THEORIES,FAKE NEWS,AND PROPAGANDA,TRUMPS ALWAYS CRYING ABOUT BIAS MEDIA,WHAT ABOUT THE DEMS W/ALL THE RUSSIANS&TRUMPS CONSTANT MEDIA ATTACKS,THEY DON'T CRY LIKE TRUMP DOES BIASED
Wait, you read the whole book!? #SpeedreadingSenator
#AmericanConservatism will forever in the future have the #Trump logo on it. It is soiled, tainted, and now worthless as a brand. #AmericanConservatism has NO FUTURE.
If you support Trump you’re a bigot or a billionaire or both. F*ck their nativist and racial resentment “concerns”. In America we don’t cede ground to authoritarians and racists.
Trump in 2020!!
Senator, the problem is many globalists don’t believe in American-style constitutional freedom. Agree or disagree?
The republican party created the division when Obama became president. Mcconnell vowed to fight everything Obama. Trump just took that several steps further creating the party if Trump. Rubio, you're no longer a republican, you're a trumpanzee.  Republicans once had values. Smh.
The party of trump has no values, only greed. That is you Rubio.
Oh piss off Rubio; the divisions were seeded, and watered by the GOP for eons; along came 45, & exploited them so you all could achieve your dastardly goals.
I refuse to believe you read a book cover to cover
Suddenly the right are saying what the left warned us about decades ago. I’m not buying it.
His ‘victory’ is currently being investigated & he will probably end up impeached for committing treason. Will you still be his BFF then?
Dude, the man is a criminal aided by a hostile power into the presidency by hacking our democracy while decimating our institutions.
it is trump and people like you who are damaging this nation. it is trump supporters who seek to end democracy and establish a dictatorship. it is you who will tolerate all manner of corruption to see this accomplished.
Uh no, lumpers are just braindead, still like lumpy, how's that wall paid for by Mexico doing? ACA?
And while we’re at it: citizens united is a decision akin to Dred Scott. You’re too beholden to monenied interestes to admit it. Djt was right about one thing: you ARE little Marco. Now go outside and play!
Smart, rational, non-bigoted people are damaging the U.S. Marco?? You’ve got that backward pal.  Willfully ignorant, bigoted , Conservative fear mongers are damaging the U.S.  Meaning YOU Sir. & the more you attempt to pander to Trumps low-class ilk, the further America sinks
Lol....and what about all the Trump supporters who dismiss everybody and everything (“fakes news!”) else???
Have you lost your mind? The divisions in America were created by the "founding fathers" that you so love...let's address the roots of hate and racism first before we look at why the flowers are so ugly....
Trump is the problem....he is morally corrupt.
Surprisingly I do agree that the divisions were not created by DJT. The divisions were created by Congress, of which obviously you have been a part. The infighting and lack of mutual cooperation...people just had enough.  Having said that, DJT has made things worse.
His victory is best explained hired people gaming the system with the help of a hostile government and the complicity of a traitorous Repub Party, utilizing an law the relevance for which had long since desolved. You’re part of the problem Marco. Now go cut & paste something!
Still. Waiting.
#LittleMarco racism is less a division than a disease that is stoked by tRUmp.
Globalism is some Govt employees moving their retirement cash to secure G fund in the tsp just prior to 9/11.    Let that sink in.    Ppl jumping to their deaths and others worried about their money.   America first ! viva la France
Highest debt ever. True conservatism.
There’s a huge difference between dismissing and disagreeing with them and their beliefs based on ignorance and resulting paranoia.
Trump is damaging to the US, and the fact that you continue to support that nonsense is why I can’t vote for you again.
I see he has you brain washed as well.
Marco, you can recall everything that happened in the Bible but you can't recall everything Trump has done?



You've successfully assimilated into the Borg collective.
Remember when you voted to tax the poor to give to the rich?

We will, in November.
Bottom line, a divided house will fail. @realDonaldTrump does nothing but further divide, undermine the foundations of this democracy and create an “us against them” mentality. This country is heading in a very dangerous direction.
Thank you, Sen Rubio, for acknowledging this widening gap; it would be helpful if you don’t aid &  abet the gaslighting of this administration by reinforcing the American Conservative idea is the only one that exists. And I speak as a fiscal conservative, myself!
Conservatism leads to fascism & globalization leads to terrorism.   Ethnicity & nationalism are human territorial traits.  The progression of the human race requires leadership & diversity that must go through the growing pains of gradual change. @CNN @smerconish @FoxNews
Lying hypetcrit little Marco sucking up to Donny the con. Prayers and thoughts
Sure, that'll make things perfect, coddle fat-ass' supporters
Forward thinking conservative is an oxymoron. All of your policies are outdated and most do not work well sorry
Note: Abusing the vulnerable to promote the perceived supremacy of the white race is not "a legit concern".
$1.05
Duh
BS
Trump and the alt-right fuel the divide with their hateful racism, sexism and bigotry.
Are you looking for a job with Trump? Why so much ass kissing?
That teain left YOUR Station a long time ago- YOU have enabled this tragedy- Easy to read an article and tweet- Not so easy to do the RIGHT thing-
In our state we have manufacturing businesses that want to expand but can't because there aren't enough workers available.
I highly recommend The List by @Amy_Siskind .
I don't believe anyone has said that Trump created the divisions but rather that trump exploited the divisions for his own interests. just like you and cruz are kissing his ass for your interests.
Hey little Marco 

Remember how Trump rendered you neutered politically?

Is he really good for us?

#ny21 here's a #shillshoutout to my home gurl @RepStefanik. Who votes Trumps agenda.

There's real damage being done to the country we both love. 

You could have won Marco.
