You are like Paul Ryan in that you don't seem to really believe what you say. It just looks like pure politics that pushes past your conscience.
He does. Anti-Muslim. Anti-LGBTQ. Lies about serving.
Yes! When we start putting the Military or Spy agents in charge of Diplomacy we are setting up a War Cabinet
Anything to take people's mind off the NRA, right Marco.
Merrick Garland
It wasn't Obama's decision to make for that seat
Yes it was
Actually it wasn't. Obummer was a lame duck. Review prior Supreme Court nominations.
We only have one President at a time. Accept for now as we have two
 One in DC and one in Moscow
Put down the crack pipe.
Rubio took 3.5 million in NRA BLOOD MONEY
yes he does
Applaud 1.75B challenge to Brightline.  This carpet bagging scheme needs to be exposed and retired.  ALSO, sending Everglades water SOUTH thru Glades needs YOUR support.  WHY is Big Sugar able to thoroughly pollute lake O with phosphate/nitrate laden irrig. water in 1st place????
Oh yeah, he has tons of diplomatic experience Marco. NOT!
Different rules for different people?
I don’t know...Is it ok if a Representative of Freedom disrespects the LGBT & Muslim community? #PompeoIsABigot #Character
In our two centuries of history we have only had a Democrat party worse than this in the 1850s when the Dems stared the Civil War. Looks like they want another one.
It's no surprise you'd be cool with his climate change denials and support for Big Pollution, but... you're also cool with anti-Muslim beliefs?
And rolling back women's rights?

#sad
Why of course not? he’s more of a hawk than  a diplomat and we need to stay in the Iran n agreement but  he will persuade Trump to go elsewhere. Florida voter
He does not support the values of most Americans. #NoToTorture
Traitor
TES.

#Pompeo failed to disclose business relationship with Chinese Gov.t during CIA confirmation.

The last thing the U.S. needs is another self-interested liar in Trump's Cabinet.
This is dumb it’s unbelievable.  A company he owned stock in, sourced product from China. That’s not Chinese ties, there is not a requirement to disclose the sourcing locations of every company you have stock in.  That would be utterly insane.
You are entitled to your opinion.

However, Pompeo  should have known  his company bought products from a company owned by the Chinese Gov.t  especially since this same Chinese gov.t owned company lobbies in D.C. on energy and deregulation-related issues.
Do you know how dumb that sounds if you’re in the logistics industry.  Companies source products from all over the world. If you were responsible to know all the products that said company sources, where it’s from, and who owns that company, that would be profoundly insane.
I have never seen journalists try so hard to create controversy when there literally is none.
Well remember, Trump did not get your vote either. So if your vote had counted, it would be 1 more in Hillary’s corner or 1 less in Trumps corner. So had it mattered, Hillary would be president now if it were up to your vote. No respect for you anymore.
In the history of our Republic, there has never been a worse, more radical, more unqualified nominee for Secretary of State than Mike Pompeo.
The fact that you think this administration should be given an ounce of deference is mind boggling.
#coward
He doesn't, it's just lip service.
This lgbt constituent of yours can’t wait to vote you out. Pompeo is a bigoted POS and obviously so are you
How hard is it to find a SecState who isn’t on record as supporter of torture?
Ashamed to see Republicans gushing at ONE DEM vote "present"
Should have been YES! I Saw KERRY toss medals at WH. 7 of my friends died nam.
How did that vote go for Merrick Garland for Supreme Court Justice?
Oh brother, get over it, Michael. That’s the way it’s worked for decades when it’s the end of the term. Nobody’s falling for your crazy rhetoric.
It wasn’t the end of the term.   Jurists  have been appointed in the last year of their Presidency on several occasions.  It was not the last 2 months of his Presidency. So, suck it up yourself.
Au contraire, Little Marco.  No decent human being would accept a nomination from the criminal in chief currently occupying our White House thanks to Putin & the complicit GOP
It's past due for you to realize the times we're in. We've never had a treasonist President in the history of our republic either, so all of his nominees should be carefully vetted. Pompeo lied about his service, which is enough to merit a 'no' vote.
NEVER had a treasonist president? How about Obama giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Iran in laundered cash money from multiple nations currency to fund Irans nuclear weapons program while they chant "death to America" in the streets? Undisputed FACT!
I'll say this slowly. It. Was. Their. Money. That. Was. Given. To. Them. From. Sanctions. In. The. 80's.
So you're ok with giving billions of dollars to a nation run by a radical nut job wanting to build a stockpile of nuclear weapons who has said America is evil & he wants to destroy it & has vowed to wipe Israel off the face of the earth?
Keep on trucking Hannity
Are you going to flip flop on your support for Pompeo like you did on your vote for tax cut bill? Florida would be better off if you would resign. We can't wait until 2022 to get good representation. #RINO
Don’t vote for Pompeo..he is a bigot and shouldn’t represent our country. #PompeoIsABigot “To deny people their human rights, is to challenge their very humanity” -Nelson Mandela
Shows how f’ing clueless you are.........
No he does not its just that the democrats do not want to see President Trump succeed all their concerned about is their hate America agenda and take over Washington to destroy President Trump and America
Merrick Garland  Own it.
It’s understandable that #Democrats don’t like Trump (a lot of #Conservates don’t like him either)but #MikePompeo is a Much More Qualified #SOS than Hillary,JohnKerry or Tillerson! Republicans & Dems confirmed them all! @SenSchumer
Sigh

That’s a ridiculous argument. It was the end of the presidential term. That’s the way it works. 

again what does this have to do with ur job. Are u in charge of hiring? What is ur job? Let's open a book and read Rubio
Never say never
Please! That’s what’s wrong with you so called lawmakers just because it has never happened does not mean it’s wrong
He does not deserve the nomination at all!
#VoteNoPompeo
Why not Glen? What disqualifies him?
@MrRyanQ1 Your man is wrong on this one. Using precedence to justify a wrong decision? Come on... 
If you come from the mold of Rand Paul on Forgein policy you won’t like this pick. What I will say is that he’s QUALIFIED, the POTUS should have the right to pick his Sec of State
Saying that just b/c we’ve always done something, that we should again, isn’t an argument. I’m not entirely sure it’s his pick and not recommended to him by someone else. IMO he’s a bad influence on the President and while he is experienced, I don’t believe it’s good experience.
Putting arguments over Pompeo’s capabilities aside, I’m just disagreeing with Rubio’s statement that we should vote him in as SOS just because we’ve always voted positively for SOS’s in the past. That’s a historian’s fallacy
Because it has not happened before is never a reason for it not to happen now.  This is the promise for change throughout history.  I know change is scary for white males, but it's coming... get ready.
Demoncrats hate:
God
America
Freedom
Constitution
Leos

Christians/jews
Then stop quoting bible verses and DO MORE.
History of service? You mean history of lying about his service
Really?! When who you are isn't good enough for yourself,  it isn't good for the rest of us.  Plus #Muslims #LGBTQ
You mean history of racism, bigotry, and belligerence. Also, FO.
Why don’t you switch parties?
I'm glad to see someone in the Senate is finally standing up to the trump. Too bad you haven't. Now you are going to be voted out. Hope you have a job lined up. They are tough to find.
What does the Bible say about hypocrites? Are you really going to stick with the president through thick (lies and incompetence) and thin?
Let's talk about Dr. JACKSON, compliments Trump and lies about his weight on national TV and is offered head of VA. just rediculous.
Oh please! Did Mitch McConnell have the right to deprive President Obama the right to seat a Supreme Cout Justice? Such hypocrisy!
Says you. He does no deserve a single vote. Buy have to kiss Trump's ads.
Lying about your military deployment doesn’t bode well. But that’s me. You seem to like liars.
He claimed he fought in Iraq when he never deployed to Iraq. For yrs, he used that lie to get acclaim & get elected. I know 12 women whose husbands died there who’d love the chance to discuss w/ Pompeo that which you won’t discuss w/him. His despicable lies & dishonorable conduct
Did Merrick Garland deserve the treatment he received at your hands?
Do you remember what you and your cronies did to the highly qualified Merrick Garland?
I changed my mind. That guy sucks ass. Don’t support his confirmation
Marco- dude- your photo does not match you words #amockery
Yes, you turd.
So I guess lying multiple times about his military service makes a mockery of our armed forces.
Wow to to Pharisees hypocrites.  Damn your bar is so low in every way
Are you a hack? Of course you are
This is just one in a long line of many embarassing firsts in this administration.

He’s a cunt. So are you.
Actually why not....if hes not qualified or trustworthy why shouldn't he be denied....or at least truly tested by the appointment process
Thank you Marco Rubio) we respect your opinion and comments. In this crazy time of turmoil and uncertainty your word carries a lot of weight and gives us direction.) May God richly bless you, your family and constituents+)
yes, yes, yes he does....wake up fake Christian
@realDonaldTrump should nominate Hillary for a judgeship she wants that requires Senate approval just to make her sit in front of a committee & answer questions.
Every time I read one of your tweets, my first thought is to wonder how you live with yourself. This one is no exception.
Sorry, but his stolen valor should disqualify him completely
You mean his history of lying about his service, don’t you Marco?
From the RCE Republican Criminal Enterprise of the United States!


We don’t know. Did he lie about his military service?  How can we believe all that other blather?  Rand Paul got “assurances” from Mike and Donnie about Iraq. Can Pompeo give us “assurance” he even went? Bone spurs and “assurances” will get you anywhere. #pompeomilitaryservice?
As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, Little Marco's vote from his pocket springs.
No Russian Administration has ever occupied the WH until now either so whats your point
The Democratic Party has nothing but symbolism and protest...
So what, bible boy! 
 Just because he was nominated by the dotard does not make him golden.
.
Yes he does. He’s a hawk
He’s a bigot, a racist. He’s a fundamentalist who believes in the rapture and all the craziness that accompanies that. He’s against gay rights. How can he begin to speak for the majority of Americans? #loveTrumpsHate #noBigots
You know who the American people deserved? Do you know who deserved a hearing? Merrick Garland, that's whom.
In the over two century history of our republic no president has ever been so dishonest, so repulsive, and so disqualified, for the job. Do the American people really deserve him? Of course not.
Your opinion Mr. Rubio and your opinion doesn’t mean much.
Look at his record
The partisan politics are at an all time high right now as you know.  It was hard to watch the democrats all vote no for partisan reasons.   Fortunately actions like this will come back to get the left.
Ere’s pendejo y un culo descarado. Pompeo lied about his military service record and demeans honest soldiers who served with integrity!
Oh, Marco.
Which side of your mouth did that crap fall out of ?
Once again you side with the man who dubbed you Little Marco, a name that you live up to.
Only to people who put party before country and have a spine.
In the over two century history of our republic, no Supreme Court nominee has ever not received an up or down vote. Cut the sanctimonious BS, Marco. #HypocriteRubio #MerrickGarland
You're an #idiot. He's not qualified to serve!
Merrick Garland
This is indeed a historic occasion - the first, and very likely last, time I liked one of your tweets.
@realDonaldTrump has lied continuously, has engaged in corruption, is in cahoots with Putin, etc.,etc, and yet, your Administration has continued to support him. Therefore, it’s only normal to find anyone he chooses as suspect. Look at the history of his selections. Get real!
It’s possibly a reaction to the person who nominated him. It would sure be great if we had someone else in that office.
Thank you Senator!
Yes. Yes he does.
And yet some were republicans!
No way
Resign liddle Marco, Florida hates you, wipe the orange off your lips and resign
Seriously?
Is he worth more than $1.05?
Sell out bitch
Yes
Maybe it’s because he lied??? Of course that’s most of #45’s cabinet! And of course, people like you who won’t lift a finger to oppose the orange buffoon!
Of course, ABSOLUTELY YES, REJECT MIKE POMPEO, for the first time in 200 years.   His personal biases, not positions based on HARD FACTS RENDER HIM INELIGIBLE TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE.   He is saying whatever he thinks will get him over any hurdles. REJECT.
Things are different with Trump. Case in point - his tweeting and use of his personal cell phone. Can't you stop this?
This MUST be plastered all across Florida if Bill Nelson voted against Pompeo! Nelson has voted against EVERY nominee so far and is a part of the problem with our disfunctional government!

We’ve never had this much of a disaster in the White House either
. , 7
Hey rubber-stamp, don’t think we’ve forgotten all that NRA money
Never in our history have we had a lying, porn star banging, traitorous Dotard as president, either.
Of course not . In their quest to hate Trump , the liberals will destroy America
He did more in North Korean negotiation than an Secretary of State over the past 65 years.
He is being attacked for his #CHRISTIAN #VALUES (Constitution article 6)?
I doubt Mike Pompeo will desert an ambassador and brave Navy SEALS and call their deaths “just a bump in the road”
During the history of our republic, no Senate had ever before refused to even meet with a supreme Court nominee for nearly a year...until Merrick Garland.
Unless your one of trumps lapdogs
The independence you frequently feign is revealed again to be fraudulent.
Yes, yeah, yup he does not deserve the position because his views do not align with the military or the people.  You seem to forget who you represent.
He’s a homophobic climate denier. He SHOULD have received a negative vote.
In our over two Century history of our republic we have never had a government stocked with so many Swamp monsters attempting to destroy our democracy
Confirmed. Sen Paul explains: ""Having received assurances from President Trump and Director Pompeo that he agrees with the President on these important issues, I have decided to support his nomination to be our next Secretary of State" ~
The most obvious area of agreement is hatred of Muslims
Indeed he does.
You are irrelevant.
Can you correct your statement regarding Pompeo's Iraq war service?  To honor the soldiers who did serve in Iraq, you should go on record and state, Pompeo did not serve in Iraq.  https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4725624/pompeo-gulf-war-vet …
Don’t you see it now...everything you and your corrupt crew will be resisted until we can throw you out!
Yes
Yes he does.

Yes, if he was appointed by Trump.  It is most amazing the amount of immorality from a U S President Christians like you Rubio will accept and call it justified because he was elected as our President by blind Sheep.. much like you Rubio.
You have no pride. Despite everything Trump had to say about you - you constantly kiss his ass!
You mean how he lied about serving in the Gulf War? Well, I guess that does make him suited to President Bone Spurs' administration...
I am waiting to hear Trump say “I like people who were smart enough not to serve
Pompeo is a sell out just like you! Neither one of you deserve to be anywhere near our government.
Oooh, how you allow position to fool you.

Has any other nominee lied about his military service?
Isn’t there a law against embellishing your service record now?
You hit the point exactly right. Secretary of State is chosen by President and trying to obstruct his or her vote due to his political agreement with the President is ridiculous!
So are going you going to agree with Trump. So sad. Trump doesn't need yes men.
What are you talking about? You voted FOR Tillerson...come on man stop lying...you'll vote for Pompeo as well...you're weak
Your always licking the peanut butter of #Trumps balls. You and Rand Paul can have a group hug.
Let’s give him thoughts and prayers. How about that?
A Secretary of State must have a proven record of diplomacy and believe in the diplomatic process. Pompeo does not. Being Trump's yes-man just doesn't cut it
Once again, Marco, you deny the legitimacy of opposing viewpoints.  Please learn to think critically.
Does Marco have a conscious?
Does Marco like being a puppet?
#Resign
And no President has embarrassed the country like Don-The-Con Trump.
Bought and paid for by the Koch's?  He deserves to be out of public service all together
No doubt you will cave and vote for him though!
Of course yes. And you know it.
I was with you until your last sentence.
Merrick Garland would like a word.
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF MARCO.  RESIGN.  YOU HAVE NO FUTURE WITH US
Merrick. Garland.
This is why we need a Wall and need to replace as many democrats as possible in November. Can elections be fair when democrats choose their districts and import illegals and give them amnesty?
Two words for you, you pompous, arrogate Prig: #MerrickGarland
With all due respect please ask that question to your Muslin constituents in our great state of Florida. Ask both Muslim Democrats and Republicans.  I am confident experience or party affiliation wont trump his problematic views of Islam.  Views that should bother you as well.
Soy Cubana-Americana. Hagamos x Vzla lo q se debio haber hecho x Cuba. Gracias, hermano!
It means find a new nominee.
Merrik Garland
Use your influence, please, so we can confirm and move ahead.
He doesnt have the temperment,  he's  just another bull in the china closet. The Sec. Of State must be a critical thinker and going to work for Trump tells me he isn't.
Yes. Vote NO
Not many lied about their service too
Thou art a clear syncophant to a cheeto, seeking only power, influence, and large campaign donations. Thou shalt remember Merrick Garland as a qualified man, free of Pompeo hateful stances.  - Abby 20:20
Yes! There a first for every situation.
We never had a president who was put there by Russia either. So, whatever Marco.
SHUT YOU DAMN MOUTH RUBIO, YOU SOROS PUPPET RINO
So? You want to send those need not be sent fir the job? Jesus ...,
You need to read our reports on 2nd American Civil War:  American Populists versus Liberal Elites!  We support you, but you & GOP are just dumb for not comprehending the DEMS are at war with you... wake up and smell the Liberal Elites’ hatred...
So sick of Democrats. #VoteDemsOut2018
Agree
To answer your question, yes.
Soon you will be voted out .  Your corrupted as the leaking president.
I called Bill Nelson’s office to see if he would ask Chuck Schumer for permission to vote for Pompeo
What about his history of lying about his service??
Regardless of how it hurts the nation the Anti-Trump people including some idiots like Rand Paul seek only to oppose and punish Trump for winning the Presidency Beyond unpatriotic it is an affront to all Americans That is the outrageous Democratic party today
Maybe he does...
Might as well acknowledge that Democrats are at war with America. It’s 1861 again.
Pompeo lied about his military service. Typical MAGAt
YES????

Go back to bible passages. More believable
If he can reign in Mafia Don from doing something crazy that will result in deaths of innocent people to distract from the Russia probe, he gets my vote.
In over two centuries we never had a President owned by the Kremlin who likes golden showers but here we are.  #GOPTraitors #PutinsPuppet
This is ridiculous!  This obstructionism benefits no one.  Grow up and do your jobs!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump through out history, religion and bigotry have been the last hope, the last straws of a dying ideology, nothing has changed, it will cost the country dearly in division and in life's, but in the end the freedom will outlast the corrupt, 
Psalm 32:6-7
Time for elected officials to put the country first! Enough of the partisan bickering! Pompeo meets all qualifications and then some. To vote against his nomination isn’t a vote against Trump. It’s a vote against the people of the United States . Nominate Pompeo now!
Oh, yes, it does, Senator. When he can easily misrepresent his military service, he can mislead you and the American public.
