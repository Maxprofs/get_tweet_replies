Did you seriously not know this? Thousands of examples...hello '80's... You don't think "right to,work" is aimed at improving wages, do you?

Oh, U mean when they didn't bust unions, had pension plans, paid living wages & had decent benefits?  Ur party helped take that away!
Did you say “Conservative movement”...I needed a chuckle today!
Everytime I see someone calling themselves Conservative, I wonder if they really know what it means nowadays with @realDonaldTrump playing president ??
That would require intellect.

Have you seen the guys all these 1950s General Motors style corporations are putting in office?
Senator your Bible tweets are starting to make more sense than your regular tweets. #disappointment

The only companies of consequence that are worrisome are media giants like Sinclair, and regional monopolies like Comcast, AT&T.
A dead giveaway to someone who is does understand conservatives, is when they say things like

"We in the conservative movement need to stop viewing big companies like they’re all General Motors in the 1950s."
Only pseudocon NR politico's do that. Sad.
