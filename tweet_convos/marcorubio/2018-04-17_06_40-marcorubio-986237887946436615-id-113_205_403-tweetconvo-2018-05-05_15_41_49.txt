Fairness would be to give the $1.05 back.
Beijing is a completely rogue government. Businessmen are also rogue businessmen. Many Beijing businessmen are doing espionage activities. The American people must unite and expel the Chinese in the United States!
xi jin ping is bad pig
End result is that American citizens will pay more for China products. 

Destroys the Middle Class more. 

Thank Trump and Republicans for not caring about the poor and Middle Class!
You buy cheap Chinese goods,you save little money but Americans loose their jobs
Most of product are not Chinese product, Company of America, EU, and Australia get the most profit. And tip as Chinese product.
Actually, They are not the business company, they are the China communist economy branch because the CCP is the final decision maker in these companies. You would never get fair in the competition, USA has already got deep lesson in the past 20 years.
U.S.A., you are 97 years late to correct your wrong expectation of CCP
Most Chinese firms are doing things much worse than FB. All the data subject to CCP use. US tech firms will never get equal rights. Chinese tech firms are espionage working for Chinese gov, should be banned doing business in US. US tech firms need to reduce exposure in China.

Makes do not admit that doing bad things, playing with business people damage the economic downturn.
The CCP officials said one thing and  did another thing  off completely differently.  The characteristic society of the CCP has aggravated the hatred of the people. In China, the patriotism has become a huge shame on the upright intellectuals.

@marcorubio Today I finally know that Alibaba influences Amazon a lot.
You guys know that China is still a communism country like USSR right?
Right. So play steel tariffs on Canada Mexico in Korea. You guys and Trump are the biggest idiots in the existence of the planet. Focused on continual pandering and greed to stay in power. We can see right through this

won't matter if your pack doesn't stop #Trump s wrecking ball to democracy and Republican party. stand up to his lies cyberbullying attacks on 1st Amendment #DOJ and FBI and USA companies ethics integrity matters
Heh. Even in Japan- they procrastinated to admit they were incorrect and needed help with the disaster. SO MUCH COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY. I am nothing special but I did study that sort of thing. There were much safer ways to contain that than what happened. Yuh I am

In China people cannot access google, youtube, twitter, wikipedia, facebook etc. They banned private use of vpn lately. With information manopoly there is no fairness, no rule of law, no transparency. Abolish the Great Fire Wall is essential. If not, break it with technology.
It will break. There is @SubstratumNet now.
There are private companies in China, and all companies are state-owned enterprises in China.
The Chinese Communist Party secretly funds Middle East terrorist organizations and North Korea and Russia. Buying Chinese-made goods is equivalent to indirectly killing American soldiers。 Support Trump to counter trade with China。God bless Trump
Fairness would be investigating Biden and Kerry sons getting $1 billion from China after Biden visit actually so. Went with Biden to China no?
Fairness would mean you would have saved the lives of the #Parkland 17! You’re complicit and guilty! #VoteThemOut
Live is not fair. Just take your businesa somewhere else. But China is a good business for US.
Fairness? Since when have the republicans been worried about fair? Where is the fairness in the tax scam? Where is the fairness in your opposition to same sex marriage? You would know fair if it fucked you up the ass.

Exactly how Trump is looking to have it
Excarely how trump is looking to Gabe it.
Say it ain’t so ... Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) announced Tuesday that he's hired Michael Needham, the CEO of prominent conservative think tank Heritage Action for America, as his new chief of staff. I really thought you were respectable.
Fairness would be you in jail for taking money from the NRA that contributed to the assault weapon killings machine being sold. You’re complicit and guilty of murder! Vote him out! #VoteThemOut
Do the Chinese make charitable donations to the NRA? Asking you because you're one of their bitches
Exactly
Usually the damn safety patrol. If that makes me boring then whatever.
@marcorubio just hired Michael Needham, CEO of Koch brothers-funded Heritage Action, as his new **chief of staff**.

Rubio LITERALLY is giving the Koch brothers the **highest** position w/in his entire staff rubio=facist
you’re a criminal 
#ResignNow
It's a must. US should've done it long ago.
No you cannot treat your citizen like the CCP do. You cannot modify democracy to adapt dictatorship. The only way is to help Chinese people to get rid of dictator.
i never met PM Abe n he deceived me n @BarackObama . He said "if i aid me, i will aid me". i aided him, he did not aided me.
Get over it and hear the people.  Get AR15’s off the market.
i want live in here when go to funeral. if need my aid, your must give your aid to me.
i need money. if can't, i can't do for your Party n nears.
@DrDenaGrayson

WHAT

Sen @marcorubio just hired Michael Needham, CEO of Koch brothers-funded Heritage Action, as his new **chief of staff**.

Holy smokes I hope you get elected as POTUS!
little marco you are nothing but an apologist for Trump wrecking ball to democracy and Republican party. you will not be reelected

Fairness would mean American companies were fined deeply for taking their money offshore to NOT PAY TAXES. Fairness would be closing the loopholes that allow them to pay 4% instead of the mandated amount you just passed.
#Hypocrite trying to ignore the problems you created!
Fairness would mean that US residents would pay taxes for the services they use instead of wrongly harming the unrepresented abroad with double-taxation. #Hypocrite
All this as republicans and Rubio want trump charge more for “fast lanes” on the interns. Effectively screwing over small businesses and citizens so Comcast and Verizon can make billions. Rubio is a stooge for cash grabbing
don and ivanka stop making their stuff in china please
For over 25 years I have advocated for "Reciprocal Trading practices" as the only way to breakdown barriers and achieve fair trade.
And our government gives companies whatever they want.
U.S should stop Chinese rogue companies infiltrating and making money here.
#MAGA, Senator of Venezuela 
I LOVE HER!! https://twitter.com/sdwind125/status/984801434947522562 …
Let's fight for fairness in China!
If you put it to an actual American vote across the country, China would know all of America means business!
Equal tarrifs! China is no longer a 2nd or 3rd world country...end the unequal tariffs!
#china should pull all their investments and business interests out of Florida.
Political propaganda!
The real reason that it would not be fair to the USA to have China agree to reciprocal treatment of high-tech companies is that China steals IP and patents from US companies, but they have nothing worth stealing. We do the R&D & they sell the fruits of our intellectual labor.
Hey @marcorubio .... good morning sir. Unbeknownst to you, I heavily advertised for you to be Bernie Sanders VP, and eventually his successor in the WH. Please talk to him for me!! I have some idea ONLY YOU TWO CAN PULL OFF!! Please give me a little second of your time sir!!
Too bad China doesn’t have the same view of us and our products and our freedoms
That is the ways of a communist state, thinking they will change is really an impossible!
We teaching Them all
Who go to the Moon first Who Build the Iron First 
Yes I do believe that
For Make the cars I Trust Spanish Make more Than China, for Dr. Chinese good about I Trust Christian Way How to Build Something is very strong.
Do U not know that U work and live in America?  That ur job is to support & defend our constitution?  U spend all ur time tweeting religious quotes and discussing other countries but u seem unaware or care about the chaos in the WH.  Do ur job until we vote u out!
Heres one for you. My friends a FEMA inspector did you know they DO NOT CHECK IMMIGRATION STATUS when they offer assistance? Are you kidding me?
Some people don't understand that a free market is only viable when everyone follows that system. The US following a free market system and everyone else not results in the US bearing the brunt of most trade deals (ex. China).
@realDonaldTrump should be letting seasonal businesses use the same H2b program he uses
this means more than our elections. Priorities
why all this talk about China. Why did you do nothing about Russia and them messing with our elections. Guess that's ok
Means China want war before  get old  no more  troops
You mean like you forcing Apple to give up security technology so you can monitor iPhones, Li’l Marco?
The Truth is the trade deficits are not fair and should be looked into regardless of how people see it. America is Christianity’s political last stand on earth and the well meaning Christian politicians whether dems or republicans should know this.... a storm is coming.
$1.05
The best thing that happened to the USA in recent times is the issue of political correctness not being correct.
There’s a big difference between Facts and Truth. Fact is subject to bias because it depends on perspective while Truth is not......
NRA bitch.

PROTECT MUELLER. 
@SenTinaSmith  @amyklobuchar 
@RepTomEmmer @keithellison
Solution for those companies is simple. Don’t do business in China. Problem solved.
WeChat and Baidu want to do what they want in the United States.
Twitter, Facebook and Google have no place in China.
People living in the city discriminate against farmers by family register, farmers have a strict rule like slaves. A sense of the previous era with laws that divide citizens. It is a discrimination national anthem. Americans do not know the history of Chinese too much.
Lol China  70 % men  30 % women  been long time  women  trade  in  us  UK  
China  now making  sex doll  robot  for men 
Next  15 years  they are  all get old
They're bad about That. un quality of trade in China. We are Human being need talking and Communications about
Why don’t you just ask the @NRA what to do, you mindless hack.
Great! Let’s ask Chinese Companies to share technology they took from American Companies.  Too Funny!
WTF do i care?
先生，半推半就可能更恰当。在顺从中，他们能得到更多的补贴等等好处。
