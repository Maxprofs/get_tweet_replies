@realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse -- why is Obama even allowed to do this crap?

correct tell me why then are helping HRC
Support the nominee Senator
I think we are in store for some crazy shit to go down if this happens. Makes no sense for us to do this! NWO
because that is what Obama and Hillary want. A weaker USA, they have done everything they can to make us weaker!
This is Obama's way of removing the damage being done to Islam. Remove the truth, exposure of corruption and rigging
we cannot let Russia and China have our Internet I need to stay here in the US. Stop giving our country stuff away
can you please stop the illegal citizenship gambit he is perpetrating on the American people! in the final days!
Not supporting Trump is a really bad plan for fighting this kind of crap.
why should we listen to Anything you say until you say I endorse Donald trump and hate to think of hrc president waiting!
Enough Sitting like #AchillesSulkingInHisTent @SenTedCruz  High Time to Give A Resounding Endorsement to 0ur Republican Candidate for @POTUS
thank you for fight against these evil people trying to constantly put chains on us
Dangerous. Obama/Dems offering more freebies to boost approval ratings.  Too many falling for it.
Despite what @POTUS believes is fair, I am for our country being as strong as we can be.
POTUS IS PURPOSEFULLY WEAKENING OUR COUNTRY.  NO OTHER REASONABLE EXPLANATION
DON'T PASS THIS FRIGGING BILL!!!!
we will lose free speach,2Nd AMNDMNT,COULD B LAST FREE ELECTION.LETS UNITE WITH TRUMP
Why would we give any of it away?  This President is determined to ruin our Nation.
I really believe That AMERICA IS SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. (OBAMA). He was placed in the WHITEHOUSE to bring down AMERICA!
Obama is determined to strip this country of its power before he leaves office
maybe if you would have supported Trump? You might have a tough time Ted? Questionable Integrity Ted? You're not a team Player!!
Honor your commitment and Help Make American Great Again; back @TRUMPforAMERlCA
thank you
blah blah- get something done.. Feckless @GOP allowing this to happen. OBAMA has NO authority to do this. You/GOP collude
 
You are old news...Cruz!
@Deborah8050 @POTUS Why are we doing this?This makes NO sense 2 give the INTERNET 2 ANYONE.DO you see Korea giving Samsung 2 UN?
this is so disingenuous.  How much money do you receive from ISPs, Ted?
....DUH
Its Obama's dream of advancing globalism. What's better than globalist control of thoughts & communication? Think!!

do you really think HER will protect free speech???  #MAGA
Because our Globalist President @POTUS hates this country.  He's the Manchurian Candidate incarnate.
Lost all respect for Cruz. Thought he was a Honorable man. Could care less what he does now
we invent it and then give it away, unbelievable.  Why r we discussing at such a late hour?
^SEE FOLKS?! CALL YOUR SENATORS AND REPS TODAY, TELL THEM TO STOP @POTUS GIVEAWAY OF THE INTERNET!
Oh, please little Filito! You know that isn't going to happen.  You know too; that there is another Internet pending too!
#Internet #NetFreedom
Why should anyone listen to lying/crying Ted?#irrelevant
you trump people are so sore that you don't care about the USA and someone standing up for it. Trump lies !
I'd rather b an intolerable than support Hillary. #lying/crying Teddy
Correction:Intolerable deplorable.
I just don't get why bash someone doing the right thing. Regardless of trump we all love USA
The right thing? Endorse the nominee as u promised? Lack of veracity= Lying Ted
so you don't care about China and Russia censoring out Internet ?
Russia/China have always reigned in 1st amendment rights. We have enough problems here to worry about.
I am not ok with this Americans need this more than #apartheidisrael
U.S., Israel sign new aid deal that will give Israeli military $38 billion over 10 years, largest such agreement. http://apne.ws/2cb66wy 
or #apartheidisrael taking our tax $$$
obama is a traitor. He could care less about the us.
ask trump
According 2 politifact...you're lying again Teddy. Why don't U either resign or start doing your job
@RoRoscoe @POTUS We as Americans need to maintain control of the internet. Obummer wants to give control away to his muzz buds.
why shouldn't you support the choice of Trump? Sore loser.
Because that is the Obama way, rede we should not have greater strength than the East, he said it and did it, now what???
LYING TED AT IT AGAIN .
Their was Obamacare and now he tries to finish his agenda with obamanet!
This onslaught is also at the feet of Boehner and the spineless repubs that refused to act 4 yrs ago!
I don't agree with Cruz on many things but on this one I support you
exactly!
Why Did the ObamaAdministration Funnel Millions to Secretary of State John Kerry’s Daughter’s Nonprofit?
Because America doesn't own the Internet in other countries.
listen to Ted he is one of the best
wth limiting #1A is clearly the problem. We don't want #censorship on the Internet
