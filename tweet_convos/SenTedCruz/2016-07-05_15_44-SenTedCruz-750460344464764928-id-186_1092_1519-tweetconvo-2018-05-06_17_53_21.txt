I think Senator Rand Paul is the only Senator that voted no on Comey becoming FBI director
The silence from our majority repub Congress is astounding. They should be filing for impeachment
Yes sir! We're coming for them!!
@JewhadiTM @senjudiciary Congress can remove an FBI director by impeachment. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution.
@Live_Free_orDie @senjudiciary stop trying to smear Hillary . This is pure politics - swiftboat. You really want trump???
oh yeah the government oooooooooh scary
#CongressMustDemandIndictmentOfHillary its wrong to know Hillary is free while Gen.Petraeus got prosecuted 4 less
The clintons seem to think they are above the law, but justice will soon be served!
U do realize that Comey gave Trump a gift, right?
Yes but with all the low life voting "yellow dog democrat" it won't matter!
true. That is why we republicans need to come together and elect Trump
tell the GOPe, Ryan and all the other never Trumps! Never survive Hil!
Ryan spoke very nicely & positively when Trump was on Capitol Hill Thurs (Fri?)
still did not endorse or speak specifically about Trump as the candidate!
Comey weighed his honor & integrity & the rule of law against Trump becoming Pres. I bet he's slepping just fine.
Cut the crap & get out there and full throat support Trump. Your ego is less than our country! Do it NOW. @SenTedCruz @senjudiciary
@auntiejul @senjudiciary Same DC BS -different day.
@M0L0NL4BE @senjudiciary Better hurry before it all gets redacted, or "lost".

I join in asking you to explain your name among Washington Madam’s clients.
I call for full access to the 241 pages of excessive, illegal or prohibited contributions in your Apr. FEC report
If only politicians would have to live under the same laws that the rest of us do. Then we would have something.
Stop wasting taxpayers money investigating nothing!! Start denouncing @realDonaldTrump if you ever want to be Prez
how can fed employees committ crimes and it doesn't matter.  No punishment. gonna ruin our country
@Callisto1947 @senjudiciary  and America demands this
Oh smart! Take a good, clean hit to her corruption & turn it over to the dummies who have done ? to stop it.
I don't think Comey will turn over his brain .
@RyanBLeslie @senjudiciary HOW ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT???
@Callisto1947 @senjudiciary smartest thing ted has ever said.
@Callisto1947 @senjudiciary FULL ACCESS!  Go get her, Ted!
When can we expect Comey's impeachment proceedings?
@GaetaSusan @senjudiciary can it be? Ted woke up? Get in the game! You can help! Big time! #TRUMP #GOP #AmericaFirst
When can we expect Comey's impeachment proceedings?
@CruzCrewSue @senjudiciary  We the People need to know why Clinton and aides are ABOVE THE US LAW
What a waste of money!  Shut up and go home.
I'm sure all of you will solve the problem and bring Hillary to justice.
#ImpeachLynch #FireComey #DisbarForComeyandLynch
I've questioned your integrity for years!
@dennis_savoie @senjudiciary Dont you think its time you told your followers to unite & fight w/Trump to beat Hillary? You lost!
it's over. Your witch hunt is over. DO YOUR JOB. #REMEMBERINNOVEMBER
FFS DO YOUR JOB! #DoYourJob #PassABill
You can't have it both ways, say Clinton is guilty W no indictments.  Ignorance is not a defense. We must have law
People are angry. The lawlessness has  to stop and the average citizen is demanding justice because Clinton lied
@WaverSox @senjudiciary thanks for doing the right thing. I only wish you were on the debate stage with Hillary
@Hardline_Stance @senjudiciary 2 little 2 late...nothing would happen for years. It's rigged....it always was!

Stop wasting time and money.  Do something useful.
A violation of the law, is a violation of the law no matter if Sec. State, Amb., DCM or a Secretary End of Story!@senjudiciary
.@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary Well then why don't u all finally DO SOMETHING about it INSTEAD OF JUST TALKING about it #Hannity
Seriously, Cruz needs to suck up the ungodly pride & support Trump.
He's not the only RINOCRAT that needs 2
Agree!! But he is a major one. I use to really like him but he is way to much about himself.
Ted get help dude
@JacobCoplenas @senjudiciary ...Blah, blah, blah....MORE investigation; takes YEARS w/ NO RESULTS; PURE GLOBALIST, TED CRUZ !!!!
@SenTedCruz @beckyginlv @senjudiciary
YES PLEASE DO. THIS IS A COVER UP FOR KILLARY CLINTON
I see all the other replies attacking u instead of punishing HRC. Keep at it Ted, stay focused as always.
Comey needs to be brought in to explain how he re-wrote the law.  He needs to to explain his addition of intentent
@mflynny @senjudiciary 

#DefundFBI NOW
With all do respect, what will that do? James Comey needs to be called in to explain his decision to not prosecute
Find a job.
@FelineBengal @senjudiciary Isn't time to support Trump sir?
You have access... to all this information, chapped asshurt King.  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/12/hillary-clinton/clinton-there-have-been-7-benghazi-probes-so-far/ …
Will it be like the #Benghazi video where her wrong doing goes on unpunished. What can be done about #FBI and #DOJ
@SenTedCruz
If they won’t do their job, they don’t deserve our support. Cut their funding and pass a new independent pros law
@zozopotamus @senjudiciary based on other Clinton timelines it will take 27 months or 75 years to get the data
No more hearings & being lawful gets us nowhere either Ted. Running out of options, need a win. Prayer?
Definitely!!! If she is guilty, and I for one believe she is. Send her ass to GITMO!
@realDonaldTrump Even though I'm a Trump supporter Cruz should be on a list for potential SCOTUS He would be tough
@CourtProf @senjudiciary Not to denigrate the FBI, its employees or Dir Comey
@USAHipster @senjudiciary And please make sure we get all the emails.
@peddoc63 @senjudiciary WELL TED, HERE'S A CHANCE TO EARN SOME REAL POINTS. TAKE THE CASE.
@peddoc63 @senjudiciary Ted take one for the team and support Trump if you don't that crook will win!
Sure - that should only take 3 or 4 years.
@adagioforstring @senjudiciary we need to do something NOW! Outrageous corrupt administration.
is there anything anyone can do about that ridiculous decision the FBI "Full Blown Idiots" made about #Hillary
@adagioforstring @senjudiciary Fine but when you get it are you gonna do anything about it? Stop talking and start acting!!!
knows Comey had to protect the Queen to protect the King. @senjudiciary
Impeach Comey!
Revoke all of Hillary's Secret clearances via Administrative sanctions.  Then she can't be president.
Why? you are helping HRC get elected. Support Trump!
@realDonaldTrump Cry me a river, build a bridge & GET OVER IT!
YOU ARE SUPOSED TO BE CONSERVATIVE & YET YOU WANT TO WASTE TAXPAYERS $ FOR POLITICAL GAIN! SHAME!
you people can't stand to lose. How much will you spend of my money like the ACA stop looking stupid
If this were someone on the right they'd be UNDER THE jail!
Today PROVES that there is NO justice & LAW matters not! @FBI EPIC FAIL! WA thugs ARE above the law!
Zodiac Killer?
hear hear. The United States is no longer fair, I don't feel that our law enforcement is fair
please blow the lid off of this like the #willfullblindness   
We're counting on you. 
You are a #truepatriot
Why don't you call for an investigation into this? http://tinyurl.com/n8p7ojc 
Here's another chance for you to politicize and waste taxpayers money.
Obama's admi. has violated law for 7 1/2 years with no accountability.  Why?
@Live_Free_orDie @bayareahausfrau @SenTedCruz @senjudiciary @FBI @YerboutiSheik @KurtSchlichter
@BamaDan78 @senjudiciary Thank you, Senator Cruz. The citizens of this country deserve better than this mess.
@txtiger1 @senjudiciary It is on Wikileaks or soon will be.
Why bother?  The fix was always in and no one is surprised. Miscreant and the refs all on the same team.
me too. I want to know how hillarys' FBI came to their conclusion & why...
File an FOIA request, wait for a really long time & then learn they destoryed some of it and didn't turn rest over
No one cares. Move the fuck on.
@Imirish69 @senjudiciary Shorter Comey: Someone else needs to run with this ball because I want to stay alive.
#ClintonMonsters
@Imirish69 @senjudiciary I'm hoping you guys exert some CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT for a damn change!
#JustlyAngryAmerican
#comey laid out enough to indict her on Title 18 sec. 793 Obamas DOJ won't allow @senjudiciary to see the evidence u kno that
@POff101 @senjudiciary We're still not voting for you Cruz. #MAGA #VoteTrump #SystemIsRigged #HillaryLied #ComeyMustResign
the house needs to start impeachment hearings of comey and Lynch. When will you all use your constitutional powers
I bet they'll be found with other missing government agency emails.
He is a serious  ,strong and honest senator that I regret not voting for him in primaries .
He left his balls at home!
@HD_Sean @senjudiciary it won't matter Senator. Clintons get a pass. #billsperjury #billsrapeandassaults #clintonfraudation
And this bastard is supposed to do it bastard?
Here: full access to climate change. Use taxpayer $ on green tech, not vilifying @HillaryClinton & @FBI.

Go get her, Ted! She's guilty & we know it!
Our legal system is officially corrupt, and without the Rule of Law, this country is in deep trouble...
Suspicious to me that yesterday on 7/4 Obama announced would campaign on 7/5 w Clinton and Comey announced no chg!
Clinton is highly qualified to be elected to the WSAA (World Scam Artists Association).
Yes. We need you to fight for us. I know you will.
impeach Obama or step down!
for the sake of our country do something!
go get 'er, Tailgunner Ted
ok so u get to see it .....What do you intend to do about it to bring justice to the USA?
@vcapozzi2 @senjudiciary it's time someone does something pretty dam soon as this is not going down too good with the people!
Then what?   You don'th ave theb alls to do anything with it.
you are a gifted lawyer- please fight this for our children and every law abiding lawyer current and in college!
as long you guys don't use any more taxpayer money, enjoy your hobby
Grandstanding-while you help elect her. If you cared about corruption you would get behind Trump 100%..PERIOD
: Enough of this undocumented Muslim president Obama and his administration.
@reaDonaldTrump @senjudiciary Cry me a river, build a bridge & get over it!
Shit! You got me again Poser! Lol
good she will be in her second term when you get it
Great!  More Benghazi!  Thanks, wasteful assholes!
Yeah...And u can use the tax payers money to get to the point. What is the point again?
cool how about you join your own party and support @realDonaldTrump like you agreed.
I think the money was under the table...
You just want your pound of flesh from her don't you? They put down dogs with less rabid tendencies than you.
I hope you will join Trump to help defeat Hillary.  Uncle Sam needs ya on board. This is a crisis.  Chips are down
Comey says it himself DOJ makes the call. 

You're up AG Lynch.
@ChuckNellis @senjudiciary Maybe @JamesComeyFBI can't find a case, but can you let #TedCruz try to?
@twright55 @senjudiciary Please start preparing the Impeachment case against her in case she gets in
Good move on your part Senator, but will it be too little, too late? 

#Justwondering
U have to be effin' kidding?!? Have U all learned nothing about how poorly UR witch hunts go? #ByeGOPinNov
Senator Cruz you are the only candidate that has the moral compass to do the job...throw your hat back in
w/o the rule of law we are nothing. For the sake of America please don't let this stand. America has lost faith in our gov't.
@twright55 @senjudiciary are you supporting @realDonaldTrump #dotherightthing
Pffft  All You Need is Their Voter Registration Cards
Comey is a Republican. What's wrong with you people? Republicans are all talk but in action they're all cowards !
And who has the authority to release those documents? Justice Dept? You have a better chance getting from Russia.
"GOP's back-up plan against Clinton goes up in flames" she is a winner today GOP are the loser
Senator, millions of Americans trust you to do what must be done.
The justice departement will "redact" anything interesting.
.@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary It's too late..The damage to the judicial system is done..No reversing that..We are now a Banana Republic.
How about starting impeachment process? Too much too ask?
@twright55 @senjudiciary UNITE US CALL TRUMP you and him have worked together before so bury the hatchet and UNITE US
I agree w/your latest tweets but today proves the importance that you and all Republicans MUST support Trump! #GOP
just vote for him. dont bash him...all we ask.
Why haven't you called for an independent counsel to investigate??? It is ridiculous you haven't done so!
Ok GOP, start another million dollars witch hunt! How about spending that money on infrastructure!!!
Grow up and don't start another great waste of taxpayer money on this. Let's see all your e-mails Ted.
good luck   TheRepublic is dying in front of us
sounds good but it's way too late.where were you months ago?
My guess is, they will not be informing you of which law firm promised #Comey a position in the private sector.
Senator Cruz, I hope you get to the bottom of this. Many are angry at the double standard that is blatantly there.
im sure that might take 2, 3 years to get
Their not going 2 do anything. No one pays a price in DC God 4 bid if I did what she's done FBI press charges
like we did for powell and rice???
All the info you need was available on the tarmac under Bill Clinton's and Loretta Kynch's planes.
Yes!!! It is time to use the powers of the Senete!!!
"Calling for" < "demanding." #Poseur
The fix was in
