Thank you for speaking on middle class and single parents who work hard and get less on taxes. We need your tax reform plan. Brillant
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the majority of single parent households would see their taxes go up.

Zodiac killer on TV! Ask him about the murders!
Such BS. Most tax breaks go to the 2% on backs of middle class/poor. How do you lie with a straight face? #KochMercerGOP be honest
I'm a working woman & I'm part of the 30% of middle class ppl in your tax scheme that will be facing higher taxes. #NotOnePenny

The GOP tax plan is BS! The super wealthy didn't get rich by giving their profits to their employees!
Donald Trump and the Russians are Destroying our Democracy and all you can talk about are Tax Cuts. Get Real and address Russia:
The @GOP will pay severely for their new found tolerance for Russia and It attack on America. Republicans have failed a most serious test.
Only thing unapologetic about this plan is that GOP isn't at all sorry about giving billionaires tax cuts & trying to convince us it's good.
You got your wars. 
You want more wars, with Iran and N. Korea. 
Now you want a tax cut. 
And you're BOUGHT.
Unapologetic in cutting Meals on Wheels? That explains a lot. There will be no growth from this tax plan. It's awful. Voter in 78732
Yes blue collar workers not wealthy wall st elites, remember that.
When can we expect your bill that gives tax cuts ONLY TO THOSE WHO MAKE LESS THAN $100,000?
Can we do something about the dishonest inflation numbers?  They leave out food and gas, which affect us every day.
Amen. If the Media truly cared about our Country & people they would support & promote this instead of causing strife. #MAGA
It's not what u say it's what u don't say and everybody knows it. #Bernie2020
Your plan gives working class' children NOTHING BUT the DEBT from this unpaid for tax cut for the 1% they will have to pay for
Did u forget Texas tool federal for the train wreck in Houston? Wat happened there?
I heard the question and answers on Sirius XM.  I loved listening Senator Cruz. Lots of positive discussion of facts and no political BS!
No BS? This is what happens when you listen to politicians and don't bother to research beyond their spin. 
Lies. Tax cut to benefit Trump and wealthy more than everyone in Texas. Repeal and replace Cruz and GOP policies.
Americans don't want to add to our nearly $21T debt. Remember when #GOP use to be against increasing the debt? Reagan & Bush taxcuts added.

They are going to need tax cuts to pay exorbitant insurance rates resulting from Trumps actions to cut subsidies & destroy the ACA
#25amendment #realpatriotsresist @all100senators Ted aims to "farm "us with his theology,taxplan and lack of healthcare #GOPDystopia @txlege
I know you really want to cut the Mercers’ taxes for them, but there is no evidence this will lead to growth, or revenue neutral.
This isn't a tax cut for the middle class, its an increase you liar
Yes, but not planned : "By 2027 taxes will rise for 25% of taxpayers, ~30% w incomes $50K-$150K & 60% making $150K-$300K" we need a #FlatTax
MASSIVE TAX CUTS for Vicious Rich Republicans, Merciless Mercers, Vicious DeVos, Cruel Kochs, Brutal Adelson, CRUCIFIXION FOR US
This BS brought to you by the Koch brothers.
You're my boy Ted. Keep doing what's right.
It’s not a Reagan tax cut... quite different.
Working men and women will vote for Beto O'Rourke!



How about give those folks free healthcare instead of an extra 1k to buy a tv?
The rich benefit and the poor get no health insurance. Great Christian values.
Tax cuts can help pay for the increased healthcare premiums! #Obamacare
Only the rich will benefit.
Herev they are Ted!
Help us working class @ELD_or_ME
The RNC/GOP doesn't like Ted. They can't hook him in the nose.
But Ted this plan does not give real men and women tax cuts, it gives you Milionaire/Billionaire friends tax cuts. Trickle down doesn't work

More #TaxReform , payment based flat tax; lowering of average tax rate not realistic long term
Remove McCain or he will block it
@SenTedCruz, worry about your own state. MI is the other 2 senators' problem. Thank you. 

Post-1913 madness

#Repeal17th
That BS the fascist GOP is oinking won't do squat, except give tax cuts for the rich during military conflicts, explode the deficit then...
Until we see your Lord Trump's Tax Returns....

don't want to hear crap about giving money to the rich.
Thank you Senator Cruz!!! 
Then you need to take Mitch the Bitch's place and GIT ER DONE!!!
Keep working hard for that 15% Ted!!! Thank you for your hard work!!!
They need support more than tax cuts.
This tax cut is a LIE. its for the 1% and will explode our deficits when you need to pay for 3 hurricanes and CA fires. Its for the RICH
I could write up a tax cut for working people on ONE PAGE.  This does not have to be complex unless Goldman needs/wants something....

We need 2 make sure everyone benefits from tax cuts. Since when does 1 part of the population deserve better than others? We all work hard

Trump's decision to end these Obamacare subsidies does *not* save money. It actually increases the deficit. https://www.cbpp.org/blog/cbo-severe-harm-if-trump-halts-health-cost-sharing-payments …

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 

Whoa. Here the WH admits the exec order will  premiums,   taxpayer costs, and screw unsubsidized people with pre-existing conditions.

No tax cuts, no growth!

Here is the Executive Order to undermine the ACA.

Long on propoganda. Short on details. Plenty of sabotage. 2/
