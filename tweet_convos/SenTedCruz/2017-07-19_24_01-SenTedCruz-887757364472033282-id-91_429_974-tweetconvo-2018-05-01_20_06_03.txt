Promises promises knowing they'd believe! Sad
Idk, Man! You need figure out a way around these obstructionist Rinos!
Uh oh... they got caught lying...... nooooo not Republicans for 7 years?? Yep they did
Repeal, repeal, repeal!!! Get out of the health insurance business.
You do know we live in a democracy right? And that repeal won't pass because of votes right?
No in fact we do not live in a democracy
#FullRepeal the ONLY honest solution.
@Heritage 
#MAGA
And for 7 years, you came up with.... nothing.
Government doesn't need to be in healthcare.
Promises should sometimes be reevaluated.
Promises Promises B/S 7 years make it 8 and still nothing accomplished by the GOP You've lost your disguise we know who you are now! DTS
How much power do u REALLY have Cruz. Not so sure u know how or WANT to..
You guys blew it.
And you will continue to fail. No substance. Just a bunch of hot air as usual.
Get their ass in gear @tedcruz.  They were all elected on repeal, just do it already.
pls can we concentrate on fixing what is wrong & quit throwing around 'repeal' #MSActivist #affordablehealthcare
Lying Ted & the Republican Congress are failures, heartless, spineless and disgusting
Wishfull words doesn't change the bleak future. The Republicans will silently block Trump to CUT HIM DOWN TO SIZE
Good always conquers evil and you and rest of the GOPs except those 2 GOPs who did not support Trumpcare are evil
Republicans are all smoke and mirrors all talk and no action they want the same things as the Democrats just don't want the blame.
Mr Cruz is one of the major problems with stalled agenda of the current administration. He should be part of the solution & not THE problem
Admire @SenTedCruz. Don't have same feeling 4 four traitors who r backtracking on their promise 2 America. REPEAL! REPEAL! REPEAL! Free mkt
Cruz needs to go home and get a real job
Your commitment to fuck us over?
This sums it 
Do it then. Don't even breathe til it's done and gone...!
Cruz has a great plan Paul can add to it so can me and Collins to make it work
All of the Congress should be Repealed and Replaced.  All are in it for themselves not the People.
Yepper!!!!!!!!!!
Go away
. Love  @tedcruz
Stay until you appeal
More talk,it never stops!We want results!U work 4 the peopleand we want results,not shallow words
Senator Cruz, you are a great statesman.
Ya will believe it when we see it. The voters will put term limits on senators, vote them out when dragging feet happens!
ahhh. Let's throw 22-32 million off of insurance
Get em Ted!
Repeal alone is CRUEL and UNCALLED FOR. You are supposed to improve the lives of the people you represent.
So this is just a political thing then? Not really worried about what lack of insurance will do to people? Awesome.
You can't even pass gas, #GOP useless goofballs
Senator, stand up for America & fight to reduce the root cost of healthcare, drugs & sve provider price gouging. Be a truthful man not bs'r
Why would he cut the profits of his sponsors?
You can also Catch Senator Cruz on #Hannity Right Now.
@tedcruz enough said sometimes just keeping your trap shut is a really good ideaTed won't stop til he kills us all @BetoORourke 2018 send 
Beto is going to lose really bad to Ted just like Wendy Davis lost to Gov. Abbott #KeepTexasRed
Let's have another repeal only vote ASAP and expose the traitors @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
Almost 8 now...............
Must get this done, Senator! Americans want NO VACATION UNTIL THIS IS COMPLETED! Congressional reelection is at stake for all!
GOP figure out how much money Dems made from bailing out insurance Co. under Obama now they want there share, got to keep those pockets full
Found it interesting, all the many points clarified by our president, seems some reps.delusional, now know bill is open 4 input.Get it done.
Appreciated what you had to say! And agree! We the People are tired & mad! Let's get it done! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
You got mail Ted!
You mean insurance companies are against having the govt force you to purchase their products - What a surprise!
ALERT !!!  BREAKING NEWS : please be advised to put on your wading boots, BS is thick and rising 
Soooooooo
All talk no action Ted & Mike show !
#RepealObamacare now!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
SO Repeal the damn thing
Good to hear, finally.
They were never serious about healthcare, was always an election ploy. None of 60 bills they passed went to his desk. Just a distraction.
Tort reform, no washington exemption, reduced graft and special interest payoffs would help also!
If they throw millions off health care with no viable replacement they r doomed
Between #NeverTrump and lobbyists we're screwed.

Just do it!!
He may have come out of meeting invigorated but Rand Paul just came out & he didn't hear a word of this Either his ears need cleaning or ??
#WednesdayWisdom #Trump #MAGA

Current HC Bill is too complex to garner majority support. 

#Repeal now. Then single item replace Bills.
But for 7 years the @SenateGOP had 7 YEARS to pass an "comprehension bill" to Fix #OBAMACARE Who's Obstruction WHO #CRUZ!?
Do Your Job !!!  Come on Republicans!!!
Great news. Pull it through POTUS!
.@tedcruz don't need to worry becasue he is under his wife Heidi's job at Goldman-Sachs
Yeah I Would think That By Shaking up Ye Nitro with A No 2 Repeal Vote  Can't Go Home @SenateGOP  Would B a Renewed Thinking
Remind those hitting the news cycle with their shields of armor lol
I REAAAALY DON'T LIKE THAT GUY !!!
U promised repeal+replace.Ucannot leave patients w/no medical care. Make your medical care same as every citizen-that will motivate4solution
If so, why Republicans do not come together & get the work done for the sake of the great country & Americans.   But not for yourselves!
Sorry if I'm skeptical 
Does this mean Cruz will now vote yes?
that sounds great but its looking like failure for them and most importantly for the american people
