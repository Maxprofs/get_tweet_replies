@SenTedCruz @RedCross Do Conservative Republicans actually pray to a liberal Jesus?  Really? ;)
@SenTedCruz  you need to be in Texas!  Do your job senator & quit skipping out! @realDonaldTrump will be a full time president!
@SenTedCruz @RedCross b/c according to your plans if elected you'll throw many more millions of american's to life without medical care.
@SenTedCruz @RedCross do you pray 4 the millions of Americans who live and die daily b/c of lack of access to adequate or any medical care?
@SenTedCruz @RedCross Or..you could be sure to vote for a flood relief bill.  Since it's Texas, you might actually do it.
@SenTedCruz @RedCross  Why don't you fight Trump! His New York values are ABORTIONS,GAY RIGHTS & HIGH TAXES Not 911 !!
@SenTedCruz @RedCross THANKS FOR THE PRAYERS FOR OUR FELLOW AMERICANS OURS NOT YOURS.
@SenTedCruz @RedCross Amen ..
@SenTedCruz Sad indeed, Remember when your complete & entire Head (ideology included) was firmly up in @realDonaldTrump Ass? Or #isitjustme?
@SenTedCruz @RedCross So funny; and, so out of character.  Little Felito beginning to sound like, "The Church Lady!"  Not really who he is!
@SenTedCruz @RedCross

Remember that you voted against Hurricane Sandy Aid when you have your hands open next week.
@SenTedCruz Do something useful instead.
