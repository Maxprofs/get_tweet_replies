I believed in you. If you lower yourself to take any position in this WH, then I'm done. Nothing left to say
Absofuckinglutely. Trump tears Cruz'S wife down & chicken shit Cruz backed trump. There is nothing lower than Cruz.
Didn’t take long for you to go back on your word
My thoughts exactly.
Wow!... Sooo...That's why you're so far up tRUMP'S  ass...UMMM... Just remember, history...shameful, absolutely shameful A.G. cRUZ???
Stop this #SecretSneakyCare. Work together w/ @SenateDems to hash out what will be best for All & not just the Rich. U will be out in 2018!
Don't let them keep funding Planned Parenthood.
I'd rather just replace you
Will you please explain to my children your reason for voting for this when I diebecause no one will insure me?
No excuses. Get at least a repeal this week. No more bull, get it done!!!
This is wrong! Listen to your TX constituents! Vote NO on Repeal or Repeal/Replace of Obamacare! My soninlaw could've died w/out Obamacare!
Idiot
You are an embarrassment to the State of Texas and the nation! @realDonaldTrump will destroy the once glorious @GOP
go Ted!
GO WHAT? Take any help away from you. Who says go Cruz. You ppl are crazy.
Notice victims of human trafficking tragedy in SA had no insurance but receiving world class healthcare?
Ted,  ur plan will price older folks out of the insurance market. ACA is better for the over 50 crowd.
Just fix it!!
Funny how your fax machines continually go down when repealing the ACA is up for a vote.  Bad form...
Is your heart really that cold and callus? You've stooped to another new low.

Why not, let's vote to kill thousands yearly and drop 22 million from healthcare while gutting 700 bil from medicaid
Remember the guy you support ripped you up.  Called you a liar..any truth to that?
#KillTheBill We're sick of this crap. Sick of telling you to STOP screwing around with health care. Vote to proceed, expect huge protests!
Sr Cruz Thank you for having the courage to lead this effort on compromise
Smh. There are no words....
Just awful, can't wait to vote blue Nov 2018 and get rid of you.  Disgraceful.
Goodness, please don't shut down the government again. Texas deserves better than Cruz.
I want what you promised. I worked for you, voted for you, gave you my money, lobbied for you, traveled, called & tried. #RepealObamacare
- Even a full repeal of Obamacare will be insufficient if Planned Parenthood retains funding
Traduzca!!!!
Looks like you miss the old Lyin' Ted days and want to bring them back
Whatever
The nuns want to have a word with you!
HC was fine until the gov't messed with it.
I'm soooo not gonna vote for you. All US Senators will thank God when they don't have to work with you anymore
I guess hurting & killing people is fair game, so long as it frays societal bonds & results in tax breaks for the rich?  8 years for...this?
What are you voting on tomorrow? Where's the bill? You have nothing but words. #TrumpcareSucks
Thank you Senator
Then all of you can go home and start enjoying the benefits of  O-Care !  Ted Cruz, I was going to vote for you .
And that's why wrote Ted Cruz on election day.....

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
I give more credence to the CBOs which have cited dastardly consequences.  We do not want this.  Constituent 75023
You ok with Trump rants on Tweeter? Just wondering when some GOP is going to break away from pack and call him on this. It's embarrassing!
How about a Senate discussion of this?
If you rep. Sen. and congressmen and Women don't start getting the Presidents agenda done were done with you !!
Why not listen to the majority of Texans, we don't want your sorry excuse of a healthcare bill. Have public meetings listen to the people
get er done
Please look at AtlasMd, Dr. Umbehr's business plan for health care, I believe it can be an affordable health care plan for many.
What is wrong with you? Asking for a friend.
You're a hateful, greedy, corrupt man and you will be remembered as such.
Mr.Cruz...Thank you for your dedication to our country!!
