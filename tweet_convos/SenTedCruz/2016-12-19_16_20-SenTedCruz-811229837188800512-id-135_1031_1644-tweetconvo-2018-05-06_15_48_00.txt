fuck Chico put his ass in Mexican hall of fame stay out our biz
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @ me next time
that is pure WRONG...judge Scalia must be turning in his grave
@tedcruz The Smithonian museum might be called"fake history" by leaving Clarence Thomas name out. Propaganda museum.
. @PoliTriXwithV <-aren't  you talking about @BarackObama
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz #boycottafricanamericanmuseum
Support Clarence Thomas
I noticed Smithsonian also left out the "first US seal" that Ben Franklin and company generated: Red Sea crossing scene
@tempteststorm2 I am adding my voice with yours. It is a disgrace that taxpayers are funding this.
Clarence Thomas a great man with amazing integrity. A gentleman. Let us start a museum that tells our world about the truth!
Uh, not sure why lyin' Ted thinks Smithsonian is a Dem institution, John Roberts is on the board of regents.  #superdumb
Hey, they will not admit that, they do not want anyone to know. 

Dewey, do you need a cry room??
no Want the treason against this country to stop.  And who who have had their hand it to go to jail.
Dewey, curious, how old are you? Any experience?
Not about me it; is about Treason.  Love/serve  this country
.. VA Improvements? School choice? Tax breaks?
RIGHT OF FREE WILL AND CHOICE> do you really want to get in this with me.-willing to  go bat
sanctity of life?
What in the actual fuck?

Sign the petition to have Justice Thomas included in the Smithsonian!
why are you white people upset about this
even we can tell it's fucked up to not have a justice in there.
how did you find time to tweet when you're so busy kissing Trump's ass ? #sellout
@GaetaSusan @SenTedCruz They will never get another penny from our family. I bet obunghole and BLM are mentioned. They are divisive.
I think it is totally out of place to leave Clarence Thomas out of the Smithsonian's new museum for his nomination to S. Crt
I can think of better Black Leaders from history that have done more in accomplishment then Justice Thomas.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Cruz is a joke. Only using this to get attention
@zrabbit30
how do these liberals think this is not horrible?why do they attack a man for having different political views-disgusting
Thomas has done nothing to distinguish himself
what about Thurgood Marshall. After all he was the first African American on the court.
Just stop government funding,
Don't forget the exhibit of Virginia's 3:00AM phone call to Anita Hill.
Thats because the Smithsonian is racist.
HELL NO Sen Ted Cruz. Put same fervor into Pres Obama nominee. Thomas has NOT done nuthn for blk folks
I won't be visiting until they correct their mistake.
Don't lie. You were never going to visit anyway.
Because Thomas is a horrible justice who does not belong on that court with brilliant minds from both sides of aisle
so the Smithsonian's doing a display on sexual predators? Or incompetent venal judges?
underneath the democrats is racism, they prove it all times. Defund them bitches. Let them find there own $ to rewrite hist.
I guess he got white washed
Yes, we should always celebrate rapists and woman abusers by displaying them in museums and making them president.
Cruz will is that pussy who kissed the ass of the guy that insulted his wife in front of the world...and that punchable face
While we are at it, isn't it time we recognized Ronald Reagan on paper bills or coinage?
Yeah, 2x spending 3x debt. Amnesty. Arm 2/3 of Axis of Evil. Cut and run. That should fit on the back, right?
.@CR @SenTedCruz YES! SI's Mission: the increase&diffusion of knowledge. 2 Black Amer SC Justices (& 1 Pres) are KEY highlights of UShistory
@TBK1955 @SenTedCruz Already?  Did he just wake up? My gosh this happened October
Well said! Thank you.
Your a sellout Glad your not being concerned for Supreme Justice.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz 
I guess that must be in line with the new racist POTUS.
why is a white Canadian worried about who is in the black Museum Texans don't stand up for black people they are oppressive
Thanks for your help Sen Cruz. He deserves to be there in the museum.
- Ted Cruz is a liar & a chicken.  Ted, on your knees again & prepare 4 Führer, Pestilence in Chief @realDonaldTrump
Totally agree enemies of civil rights should be acknowledged.
Because he's a great jurist? Safe room for Cruz. 
is "bigly" even a real word?
Fire the administrator on Jan 21, 2017
.@SenTedCruz don't you have anything of importance or real value to worry about?
Because they only consider Marxist black's as worthy of celebration. Consider the sources.
Smithsonian has been a joke for a long time. I called the US History museum the 'Museum of self Hate'
if he were a liberal this wouldn't even be a thing.
#BoycottTheSmithsonian
#RT
TELL THESE PC OVERLORDS TO SHOVE IT
maybe trump can add him
Shameful. You have to ask why!?
Much respect to @SenTedCruz for this but it does show his fixation on symbols rather than stuff that actually affect people, hence Trump
TED CRUZ 4 SCOTUS 
bite me
fire whomever runs it now
Great pic of you, Senator.  It shows you as the tough lawyer you are.  Keep up the good fight!
he's a creep
- Good Job ! There's my Ted Cruz, where have you been Sir ?  Don't let me down !          You  Are  Needed !
Kudos to Sen Ted Cruz; the omission of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is disgusting.
It's embarrassing how nakedly partisan they're being with this, they thought no one would notice such a gaping omission
It didn't even occur to these assholes that anyone would complain
Why Does Clarence Thomas Hate Black People? https://trofire.com/2015/07/06/why-does-clarence-thomas-hate-black-people/ … via @ringoffireradio
Stop their funding. RACIST museum.
Thank you...Not only black, but a great jurist.  Smithsonian getting political not good!!!!
Clarence Thomas' legacy is remarkably dull, boring, and replete with failures, in addition to ignorant conservatism.
cut off all funding until they put Thomas in the presentation!
Thank you, Senator.
@tedcruz You're planning for 2020 when you'll need the black vote! Trump will shame the GOP & Dems will win the White House Comgress
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz  Why?
Thomas opposed the Civil Rights Act.
Thisis WHITE Supremacy, Ted Cruz, TO REMEMBER EVERY Good Deed. Congrats! @CR @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence

@CruzinAhead @SenTedCruz long John dingdong never touched a Coke CAN again Monsanto MonSatan head. Clarence is POISONOUS cancer a trump
Ppl were outraged about this oversight when the museum first opened. Ted is actually trying to fix it since whining won't.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz They did mention him and his brilliant turn in Django Unchained
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz 
It's because the Smithsonian is racist. ;)
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Go get em Ted!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz we say give me liberty or death under the tyranny of trump. We are fighting 4 democracy. You are not.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz now in your blindness we fight against your fascism influence and state capitalism
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz we are not obstructionists at this point. You have effectively turned the demo party into modified lib.
Well Ted, tell PresTrump & hewill fixit! Who is your daddy now Ted? WHO IS YOUR DADDY NOW?Let's ALL make Americagreat again!
That's...  My.... Senator....  #GreatMan
even his kids didn't want to be with him turn their heads when he tried to kiss them
Thank you
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz an exhibit for a man who never asked one fucking question from the bench for decades- until his owner Scalia OD'ed.
Sad that is seems the Smithsonian joined the ranks of the "progressive" agenda pushers w/ Nobel Prize/worth<
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz I agree. To exclude Justice Thomas is beyond insulting.
not to me, most black people...don't be insulted, be assured the right decision was made this time!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Than you Senator Cruz.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz u r right Ted! Again
Good catch, Senator. Thank you!
@tedcruz Cruz take a nap
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Good job sir!
Teddie spends most of his time dreaming up things to be upset about in order to keep his name out there. #LOSER
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz I will gladly sign a petition to include Justice Thomas
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz another liberal institution, what a shame
@tedcruz I like @SenTedCruz more and more everyday!
praise ve to my dark emperor Ted long may he reign
shame on the Smithsonian
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz 
Thank you Senator Cruz for support of fairness.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz That national museum is for ALL of America...not just liberal black Americans!

hey Ted! How about you call out trump on 1.2 trillion stimulus, and 35% tariffs. Or maybe planned parenthood funding.
