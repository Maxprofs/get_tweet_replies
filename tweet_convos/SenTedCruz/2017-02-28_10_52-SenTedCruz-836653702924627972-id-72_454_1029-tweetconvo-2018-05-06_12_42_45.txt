Absolutely!  It's insanity for our American Government to provide aid to people who would in turn use it to slaughter us
or our allies.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Why do we give $ anyway? The US DOES negotiate with terrorists. No other way to explain it other than that.
@hectormorenco @SenTedCruz #buildthatwall looks like we found some cash for OUR Infrastructure Terrorist Funding MUST Stop!!!

totally agree
How about we stand up for the people that the Settlers are stealing land from in violation of int'l law?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz be fair, the United Nations has sided with Palestine on the illegal taking and settling of their lands by Jews!
all foreign aid must go. No . Food and medical aid only. Budget must be balanced.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz how about some savings by cutting funds to Israel
Can you give am example of an Israeli terrorist attack? JC
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz We're giving $ to the Palestinians?!!! What other countries do we aid? China? Cuba? Venezuela? Just wondering
u mean besides Iran?
I'd like to know all the countries we give $ to. Everyone knows about Iran.
I was being sarcastic.Start with Google? Go to library? Call you Senator's office? Reps office?
Cruz has great soundbites but ZERO accomplishments.. Self serving promos-not an accomplishment
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz needs to stop now! Otherwise we are talking out of both sides of our mouth!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz wahoo
@RaheemKassam @SenTedCruz amen, amen, amen 
Sounds like a plan!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz   PLO is Isis family.  Isis is Iranian guard. Covered up.
This insanity needs to stop now. Another example of 8yrs sympathizing  for ISIS by the Obamanation.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz what about Israel's attacks on Palestinians?  What about the Israel's incursions? What about the settlements?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Newsflash: if you've been paying attention, we have far more serious problems to worry about.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz amen

@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Add this to the file called "Things to Remind the GOP of when our Embassy in Israel is bombed"
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @POTUS this is crazy why are we sending our citizens hard earned money to fund terrorist that kill our allies.
Yeah, so the taxpayers can have r money taken by r government/Republicans.
@foxnews @Potus @kredo0 @sentedcruz @tedcruz WHY R WE giving aid (Taxpayers money) 2 Terrorists, anyway?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz On this I support Sen. Cruz 100 %.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz foreign aid is %1 of the budget. Quit being a chicken shit, work on entitlements and fix the damn budget.
I agree and support it. But who am I. Carry on Senator.
There has never been any group in history known as Palestinians.
Palestine was/ is a geographical area populated by Arabs and Jews.
That will sweep the whole horrible mess under that carpet. Or is that where you're getting $s for military?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz how about cutting all aid to all foreign countries?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz definitely
We still don't know what happened to the $200+ million of OUR money they found in Arafat's Swiss acct's when he croaked
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Why in the hell is U.S. giving Palestine anything?!
Why in the hell is U.S. giving Israel anything?! Answer that then the other.
