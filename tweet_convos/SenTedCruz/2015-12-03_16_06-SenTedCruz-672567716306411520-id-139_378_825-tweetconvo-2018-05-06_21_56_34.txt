@SenTedCruz stop beating this dead horse, how about trying to figure out a way to stop the killings in America daily!
@dRiveraCash @SenTedCruz Not a dead horse. >300k vets died waiting for their healthcare applications to be processed. System is broken.
@systemMD @dRiveraCash @SenTedCruz  Whole different subject and Cruz has a plan for that too
@itsmesteph11 @systemMD @SenTedCruz Also, can someone tell me why Ted voted against background checks for terrorists on a watch list?
@dRiveraCash @itsmesteph11 @systemMD @SenTedCruz He didn't. He voted against making people fail background checks without due process.
@CLForstner @itsmesteph11 @systemMD @SenTedCruz - Due process to not fail a background? But they pass laws daily that have holes? No?
@dRiveraCash Do you think it is right to strip rights from someone without accusing them of a crime or allowing them to face charges?
@CLForstner - Of course not, but why hasn't that been a reason to NOT sign bills in the past?  I'll tell you y, d NRA is n his pocket...
@SenTedCruz 

Too bad you don't have the same passion for keeping terrorists from buying guns.
@pubic_slugs @SenTedCruz  They already have STRICT gun laws in Cali. How about YOU figure out what to do. Obvious their laws don't work!
@itsmesteph11 @pubic_slugs @SenTedCruz - Show me a state with or without gun laws; and no gun issue. They don't exist
@SenTedCruz You will do anything to support those who fatten your pockets at the expense of the American People.... #USELESS
@JdotBrown You have just described EXACTLY what Lib/Progressive/Dem/RINO'S do. Americans have NEVER had it as bad as during last 7 years!
@lynnie5155 all politicians are like that really and it hasn't  just been when Obama has been on office ..wasn't  peaches n cream for bush
@JdotBrown Difference is Bush was a Progressive, just like ALL Dem's & RINO'S [Jeb Christie Kasich Pataki Gilmore Graham etc.] NOT TED CRUZ!
@JdotBrown Best part; Dem's & RINO'S have tipped their Marxist hand far enough now that, WE THE MAJORITY, have seen & they'll be VOTED OUT!
@lynnie5155 Everyone is to busy trying to protect a party and whoever is fattening pockets.
@JdotBrown Trust me; Senator Cruz has NOT & will NOT compromise his principles for money; he LOVES America, her Constitution & her citizens!
@lynnie5155 that's what every politician says, until the Special interest funds start pouring in, and they gonna want favors
@SenTedCruz #Kochwhore
@j6bj6b @SenTedCruz I love it when stupid people get on twitter. Koch hasn't given any Republicans money much less Cruz
@itsmesteph11 @SenTedCruz So...coincidence???
@SenTedCruz Rafael, why are you ashamed of your real first name??
@SenTedCruz @NahBabyNah right on
@SenTedCruz U will never be the estab.pick, STOP CruzPAC bashing Trump, its EXACTLY what they want @realDonaldTrump #makeamericagreatagain
@SenTedCruz And then several million people will be left without affordable health care.
@SenTedCruz @AZPatriot01 please it s killing me and my family
@SenTedCruz Yeah! I hate giving people a chance who are poor and are in need of healthcare! Screw everybody! #GetCovered
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad Senator, you have your public funded healthcare; you want to deny those who can't afford, their access to healthcare?
I pay $47/month with a $500 monthly IRS credit.  My total out-of-pocket is $250.  What is your alternative?  Get sick and die?
@SenTedCruz But you'll keep your taxpayer funded Healthcare, Right?
@SenTedCruz Please Ted, pocket your hate and evaporate.
@SenTedCruz how can we defund U??
@SenTedCruz but you didn't vote to have background checks for terrorists who want to buy guns... @igorvolsky
@achanu @SenTedCruz  This is hilarious. Background checks for terrorists buying guns. How do you tell the terrorists & the good guys apart?
@itsmesteph11 @SenTedCruz ones that are on terrorist watch lists....he voted to let those on the watch list freely purchase guns....
@achanu @itsmesteph11 @SenTedCruz No he didn't. He voted against a bill that stripped constitutional rights without due process.
@SenTedCruz @Mike_Beacham #ObamaCare
AMEN @SenTedCruz  #DefundRepealObamacare and #restore choice and #open up #competition to make heathcare #cheaper for americans
@bakerlarry84 @SenTedCruz - So how would he cover the under severed when they're kicked off coverage?
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad You know very well that #Obama will veto any attempt to defund. Elect #Republicans then you can make changes
@SenTedCruz and I will do everything possible to see you are put out of a job! Cruz the Antichrist!
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz FRICK you
@SenTedCruz So you're saying you'll do anything & everything necessary to kill Americans. How exactly are you different from ISIS?
@HonoluluHawk @SenTedCruz remember all GOP establishment said that. Politicians all talk no action. Trump our only hope Cruz is a puppet.
@SenTedCruz - You will be the next U.S. President
@SenTedCruz Sen Cruz, your words and actions defy decency and do not reflect the values of your constituents.
@SenTedCruz And you will replace it with a Single Payer Plan?
@SenTedCruz That's why you're my guy!!
@SenTedCruz "Tearing Down" should be your
mantra.
@SenTedCruz BECAUSE, WE THE MAJORITY, HAVE ALWAYS SCREAMED, 'NO' to 0bamacare
@SenTedCruz Health insurance costs for WORKERS has spiraled OUT OF AFFORDABILITY, it's KILLING Small Business & MORE Citizens are DEPENDENTS
@SenTedCruz Big Love for you Ted and the leading GOP's...Save the kids dump Common Core, unleash kid's greatness w/solid Edu skills.
@SenTedCruz @DDupre9 so you will be providing me with insurance .I am now covered  after having been cancelled due to PE condition in 06
@Maggyw519 @SenTedCruz My dearest, please do not hold your breath. The real birther does not have want it takes to deliver anything
@DDupre9 @SenTedCruz of course he doesn't ..just like reminding him if the consequences of his hate
@Maggyw519 @SenTedCruz What's shocking is that the likes of him & his merry fellows are even influencing folks who suppose to have smarts.
@SenTedCruz thousands of Americans a year, far more than terrorists have ever killed. Yet that's what you want to do.
@SenTedCruz you gotta become POTUS first.
@SenTedCruz I'm glad to see that you'll continue wasting your time. Why don't you try to something constructive for a change.
@SenTedCruz You Loose!
@SenTedCruz isn't it already defunded? Many exchanges already bankrupt. Many policies dropped
@SenTedCruz why not pass a bill to help veterans and first responders of 9/11 instead?
@SenTedCruz wish you would worry about  90 people getting shot every day instead.
“@SenTedCruz: I will do everything necessary and anything possible to defund #Obamacare. ” Boss
@SenTedCruz anything necessary to keep us the only developed country where healthcare is not a right.
@SenTedCruz I will do everything necessary and anything possible including pose nude to defund #Obamacare."
@SenTedCruz  like your  ideas, Dont like the coca bro. Since your im bed w/them you lost my vote
@SenTedCruz What's wrong providing healthcare? Jesus did it.
@SenTedCruz And THEN what? What's your plan? We're waiting....and waiting...you don't have one, you loud mouthed jackass. Just STFU. Ugh.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump both are you are our only real choice for President & VP. All the others need to drop out & Clinton too.
@SenTedCruz don't defund it, eliminate it
@SenTedCruz TRY doing the same for Mass Shootings in Churches, Schools, Workplace, Theaters, Malls...
@SenTedCruz What is wrong you?  Repeal the free health insurance for Congress
G-d Bless You @SenTedCruz for doing what you promised voters you'd do & not ever giving us excuses like GOPe shills #DefundObamacare
@SenTedCruz and then what? Seems we'd be right back where we started. Anything gonna take its place?
.@SenTedCruz there was a mass shooting in CA yesterday, and you're still wasting time trying to defund the #ACA?
@SenTedCruz @JoshSchwerin And replace it with what insurance?  Actually don't you have Obamacare now?
@SenTedCruz thank you for savings millions from the evil of health insurance's
@SenTedCruz I want the same insurance benefits YOU get. Why take away mine?
@SenTedCruz I think destroying Isis is more important issue at hand.
@SenTedCruz On a serious note, Senator Cruz, it would be wise to know that you and Republicans have lost against Obamacare. Accept reality.
@SenTedCruz HAHAHA! Remember the last time you tried to defund Obamacare? It led to a government shutdown that lost the U.S. $25 billion!
@SenTedCruz which means nothing will be accomplished. Just the same game.
@SenTedCruz provide a rational alternative , don't just rave against current law. Dunce.
@SenTedCruz Hope you do. My children had to drop there health insurance can't  afford. Have no insurance now
@SenTedCruz #justdoit
@SenTedCruz Apparently even bankrupt the nation by wasting tax payer $$ again & again on an already lost battle. Oops. Late 4 my death panel
@SenTedCruz this is called diversion to what's going on.  Let's remember that fancy boy sweater.
@SenTedCruz Why? It's working very, very well.
.@SenTedCruz because you want to take health care away from over 16 million people? Why are your proposed policies aimed at hurting people?
@SenTedCruz what about mass shootings ? Pray ?  No clue
@SenTedCruz What is your plan to replace the affordable health care act ? You don't have any alternative do you?  Healthcare for the rich?
@SenTedCruz Where is your birth certificate? YOU & your running mates don't care about workers just rich! You are as bad as Trump!
@SenTedCruz How about the NSA?
@SenTedCruz This cost small businesses $600.00 a month per employee. That's crazy. Plus the taxes that are sent to the insurance companies.
@SenTedCruz Why do you hate poor Americans who couldn't get health insurance!Improve it don't destroy peoples lives!GOP stinks!
@SenTedCruz Yeah, do that. Then you can pray for the people left without healthcare. IDIOT
@SenTedCruz if mental health issues are so important to you in the fight against mass shootings this is the most stupid thing you could do.
@SenTedCruz - And when will you tell us your plan to get everyone healthcare coverage?
@SenTedCruz please please please don't stop fighting for Americans!  I trust you to lead our nation!  We need you!  #conservative #American
@SenTedCruz go suck eggs Ted Cruz
@SenTedCruz 

We must prevent poor children from seeing doctors at all costs. It's WWJD!!!!1!!!!
@SenTedCruz Good thing the likes of you are here to fix the most pressing problems in this country...
@SenTedCruz Please defund the Unaffordable No Care Act before it obliterates an entire industry and the USofA
@SenTedCruz I been watching and waiting.
@SenTedCruz so much respect for you, sir....you're keeping your word.
@SenTedCruz 600,000 Texans who have lost their PPO's....are with you!!!
@SenTedCruz If you are elected use an EXECUTIVE ORDER, to undo all the DAMAGE Obama is doing to this country.
@SenTedCruz Yes, Teddy, go right ahead...you'll be helping out the Democrats in 2016 and we thank you for that.
@SenTedCruz

Teabillies warned us about []
congratulations [][]
@SenTedCruz That's not a solution. But what do you care? This is just politics & you say whatever it takes.
Translation-I will do everything to poor ppl & keep fat cats rich. @SenTedCruz go back to Canada
@SenTedCruz Don't think so. Overall, GOP hasn't been successful w/ anything concerning Obama.Sorry but that's the truth.It's always all talk
@SenTedCruz praise the Lord, with #TedCruz there's hope for America. Proverbs 14:34, pray from Canada for your election. #GodBless
@SenTedCruz I will do everything necessary and anything possible to ensure you are never #POTUS
@SenTedCruz Why don't you start with NRAcare? Oh that's right - the NRA funds YOU!! Oops, My mistake.
@NYgrooveX @SenTedCruz ditto
@SenTedCruz And THANK YOU for that
@SenTedCruz do not worry about it.  You will never be president.  NEVER
@SenTedCruz good luck with that...it is hurting the lower and middle class. What can you do that will help us?
@SenTedCruz Sounds nice until millions of Americans discover that you're taking away the health care they finally got thanks to "Obamacare".
@SenTedCruz you almost don't have to, it is going to implode on its own.
@SenTedCruz & propose a health insurance system where individuals can buy affordable health insurance like they do all other insurance
@SenTedCruz OMG, why do you continue saying things that will never happen, now be a good little boy and go play with your republican friends
@SenTedCruz We have bigger problems.
@SenTedCruz We're counting on you, Ted...you are our "Cruz Missile"!
@andreajmarkley @MonsterMarcia @SenTedCruz @SenTedCruz spews soundbites again. Seems that's all his brain can handle. Another #GOPHypocrite
@SenTedCruz Then vote yes for the 1st step of gutting it.
@SenTedCruz tell us what your solution or plan to replace it and by the way You are using ACA too!
@SenTedCruz How are you enjoying your taxpayer funded government healthcare you hypocrite? #AskingForAFriend
@SenTedCruz and do what watch millions suffer? ?
@SenTedCruz Actually we like having healthcare for a change.
@SenTedCruz I would rather you had said "repeal" #Obamacare.  Defunding is fool's gold and will never happen.  Don't sharpshoot us Ted...
@SenTedCruz . Go all in Mr. Cruz, defund Obama!
@SenTedCruz Please & Thank you!
@SenTedCruz yes!!!
@SenTedCruz YOU HAVE MY VOTE!
