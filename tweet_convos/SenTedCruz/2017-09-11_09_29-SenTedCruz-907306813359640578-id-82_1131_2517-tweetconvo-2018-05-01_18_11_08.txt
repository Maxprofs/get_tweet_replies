Boooo
DOESNT STOP TED BEATING HIS MEAT
Makes me beat mine faster
We will never forget
No we won't forget!
Man has good taste, albeit very vanilla
why doesn't anyone at the NYPD stand up for TRUTH and talk about who really knocked those towers down?!
@tedcruz literally j**ked off to porn on 9/11.
#neverforget The horrid monsters that claim they want peace. I wish we could just wipe Isis to extinction. Many lives were lost
Very soon the Snowflakes will want to Tare Down 9/11 structures, statues or anything else that records the History of Evil America
I'm with you, NYPD! My thoughts & prayers from Houston TX!
Don't worry, we'll #NeverForget what you were doing 9/11/17!
NYPD must have come w results in 16 years

The original headline was "Ted Cruz Masters Smartphone Single-Handedly."

Did you just assume their gender?
God bless heroes...
Heroes never die
What's the difference between 9/11 and a cow?

@SenTedCruz
This is censored by default, good to know #Twitter enjoys free speech as long as they agree with it.
Least we forget.. may God bless them all.
You will never be forgotten. I promise.
I solute the men and women who sacrificed to save and our families, friends and loved ones...God bless them all in their heroic efforts..
Is that the day you were busy watching porn
This is SICK dictatorship when anyone ask you to take a VOW.
You don't have to join a cult to always remember 9/11. It's brainwashing when anyone tries to get you to do this. We can all remember.
I WILL never forget, nor EVER forgive!!!
Are you anonymous?
We will NEVER forget! #911Truth #911FalseFLag #InsideJob #NoMoreLies
This is some weak shit. Sad. Need to step it up faggot

By invading and destroying several Muslim peoples that had absolutely nothing to do with 9-11. Never forget that!
Those were some very brave dudes. They never backed away from any situation. May they rest in peace for eternity.
No one's going to forget. Just stop making anyone take a VOW. HOW OLD ARE YOU TO EVEN SAY THIS? REMEMBER ON YOUR OWN.

Americans, 

#NeverForget that Republicans used 9/11 to invade Iraq and got 4,509 US soldiers killed so they could make billions of dollars.
Wash. DC seems to have forgotten otherwise we would have a WALL. Those here with expired Visa's would be gone and Illegals would as well
Ted Cruz is the worst kind of hypocrite. After his vote against the Zadroga bill, does he really think the NYPD cares about his retweet?

@tedcruz Lets also remember Mr. Family values preacher is a porn fan. Hypocrite!
@tedcruz
Trump and 9/11:
Said his building was now tallest in NYC
Claimed lots of his friends died
Claimed NJ Muslims cheered…
Wish they can bomb you for what you did to Libya and Afghanistan.when you bomb other Nations and innocent pple die you call thm casualties
Dont go to war overseas and bring this aftermath back home...they stay at war even after it is declared until the last man stands.
Never Forget 
Let's honor the victims by telling their families & nation the 9/11 TRUTH - INSIDE JOB - FALSE FLAG - &$$GREED
Yes, I agree...
We will #NeverForget911 YOU R OUR PROTECTORS & OUR    love from Texas 
#NeverForget911 
#NeverForget that the Republicans represent "values"     Instead of honoring our fallen he searches porn. #Deplorables
RIP
My heart is with you. I will never forget that day.

Bless each one of you..many brave souls lost that day. They wont be forgotton.
False Flag
Remember it like it was yesterday and I'll always remember all those brace men and women. #GodBlessAmerica
God Bless all our Police Officers and Fire Fighters who lost their lives on September 11th. God Bless you and your families.

God Bless them all.

#WhoDoneIt?
Every law, every edict uttered since 9/11 has been a crime built upon the ultimate crime.
The murder of one's own people......
I'm with you. I will also Never Forgive.
@swargcoming see AE911. Richard Gage
May the Lord Bless all of those who died that day: Every NYFD, the Outsider Responders and the Innocents. All dieing that day for a UN plan!

Rest in Heavenly Peace 
Your mayor and Cyrus Vance would like to forget.  They feels we deserved it.  So sorry you have to serve under that hateful leadership.
I ran into a retired 9/11 first responder from NYPD at Flight 93 memorial at the end of July, inspiring moment. #neverforget
#salutetoservice #NeverForget
#911remembrance NeverForget 
You need to remind TB District 11 CO apparently he forgot

16 years ago, today, Trump talked about how his building was now the tallest one since the World Trade Center fell. 
Amen! Reason DeBlasio is a slap on the face of NYC. We must put patriots back in charge in all offices.
don't forget the why either
islamic terrorism
Exactly, as the Islamic sympathizers must be #DRIVENOUT of all positions of power. #NoAmnesty Build the wall!
我希望死12亿中国人
