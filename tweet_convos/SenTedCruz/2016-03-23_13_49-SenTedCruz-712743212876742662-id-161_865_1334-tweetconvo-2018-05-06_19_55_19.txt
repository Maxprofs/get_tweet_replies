@SenTedCruz The ACA is working! Don't fix what isn't broken! You care nothing about the American people if you take away their healthcare!
@SenTedCruz here's some adult advice, senator creepy mcCreepypants Check out @Stonekettle's Tweet:
Remember the part where Republicans COULD have helped make the ACA better, but acted like children instead?  https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/712743212876742662 …
@T_FisherKing @SenTedCruz @Stonekettle Remember that time Republicans presented amendments to ACA and they sat on Harry Reid's desk?
@SusieHaynie @Stonekettle lol.you mean the ammendments that stripped it's coverage and gave more flexibility to ins companies to drop folk?
@SusieHaynie @Stonekettle can't see why Harry wouldn't jump on that .... shocking

@SenTedCruz #CruzforPresident
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump  at least  we know that Donald has the ability  to negotiate Trump >Cruz.

@SenTedCruz Get over the ACA. Too popular to be repealed.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz but nice try to pivot from a gut reaction to have wandering bands of religion police thugs
@SenTedCruz remember we have a better plan? Yeah you just ran on no
@SenTedCruz This list can be made for most potus. We, the weak & spineless American voters demand that politicians lie to us. Truth is scary
@SenTedCruz How about first trying to get the @tedcruz @glennbeck @marklevinshow definition of carpet bomb correct and use proper context
@SenTedCruz and Dishonest Donald wants universal healthcare
@SenTedCruz remember when Republicans had about a hundred opportunities to help craft the law but spat in the Dems faces? Good times.
@SenTedCruz no longer can go to hospital of choice thanks to Obama care.
@SenTedCruz Idiots.  Low-level analysis.  Let's put things in Context.  If everything in previous plans remained the same - - then yes! more
@SenTedCruz However; because HIC had been providing, what Consumer Reports called, "Junk," Insurance; they didn't meet new Standards. more -
@SenTedCruz It was HIC's that provided new policies; and set the rates; and, we know how greedy they have been for 40 years. one more - more
@SenTedCruz ACA not Socialistic enough to grant the whiners their wishes as noted above. HIC still in Control. Now Medicare is Socialistic!
@SenTedCruz what about those of us who want to keep our insurance or cant afford it without the rebates?
@SenTedCruz Ted you are with the Washington cartel now you lie ,cheat use dirty tricks to get elected never Ted fake Christian
@SenTedCruz We do remember, so why on Gods given earth would we want to jump from one liar to another. Your cruz ship is sinking. Lying Ted.

@SenTedCruz what will you replace it with? No ideas just no. #thenewgop
@SenTedCruz  has Obamacare help you with the cost of lithium for your wife?  Go TRUMP
@SenTedCruz News flash......the Dems controlled Congress when  the ACA  was passed.
@SenTedCruz Obama knew he was lying when he said these things.
@SenTedCruz Remember the names of the hookers you paid for?
@SenTedCruz so, the goal of the law was good? #cognitivedissonance
@SenTedCruz Your Muslim plan need to be house to house search they don't like it Deport them.1400 Years of Muslim BS with their hate!
@SenTedCruz really? You're worries about Obamacare today? How about you worry about beating Trump.
@SenTedCruz ...CRUZ/FIORINA 2016!
@SenTedCruz again.....how would you know what we go through.  You are not even on it.  You are exempt.

@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz remember when the pr amnesty group club for growth endorsed Ted Cruz?
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Not broken promises, just plain lying. They knew what Obamacare would do to this country but shoved it down our throats anyway.
@SenTedCruz Hey, it's gov't! What do you expect.
@SenTedCruz the world will remember you as the 21st Century's Bull Connor.
@SenTedCruz TED CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT
@SenTedCruz — here's what I remember: this was an idea put forth by conservative Heritage Foundation in the '80s. Hmmmm.
@SenTedCruz I remember when I tried and failed to abolish it 60+ times
I remember you costing the nations billions with #GOPShutdoen to force repeal and failed. You're economic illiterate @SenTedCruz
@lawhawk @SenTedCruz do you really think that shutdown really affects anything? Those who missed work are paid when they go back to work
@SenTedCruz I also remember."Elect ME & I PROMISE to repeal Obamacare & STOP ILLEGALS!"  Power if the PURSE! But that was a LIE TOO!
@SenTedCruz Your an insider... !
@SenTedCruz What about people that like their current plans through Obamacare?  Will they be able to keep them if you fully repeal??
@SenTedCruz Like the broken promise when you said you were not in the establishment...#AlwaysTrump to save America
@SenTedCruz remember Ted said he was an outsider
@SenTedCruz No Ted Cruz is the goddamned liar. All those promises were kept.
@SenTedCruz They are also charging fraudulent premiums. I have proof.
@SenTedCruz I couldn't even get AHC-said I didn't make enough money.  Took friend's total tax refund-because didn't have AHC. That is wrong.
@SenTedCruz Most people I know..pay a huge premium..co-pays-deductible is so high-would never meet it unless very ill. Friend's is $6,000.
@SenTedCruz I had $155 a month thru my company. They had to drop because of expense. My new cost under ACA $820 with $6000 deductible
