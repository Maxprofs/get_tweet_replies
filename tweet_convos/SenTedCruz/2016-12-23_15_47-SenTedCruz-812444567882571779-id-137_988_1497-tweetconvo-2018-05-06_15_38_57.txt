Today's @UN vote is the culmination of the Obama admin's systemic agenda to weaken #Israel & strengthen its enemies. http://bit.ly/2hl6CdR  
These horrible plocies will soon be things of the past.  #UndoObama

I agree
The UN exists only to attack Israel and America while funneling money to the corrupt. It's time to say so.
It is a wonder any nation would align with us after Obama stabbing our closest ME ally in the back. Who could trust us?
I suspect after Trump runs his mouth and puts on the brink of the abyss not many would want to support this maniac Trump!
And would you be willing to give Trump created if he got the economy going and defeated ISIS? Probably not.
Economy is ok.  He will not defeat ISIS! He is a joke. A Hitler wanna be. ISIS will just reappear under another name.
It is this kind of myopia that has cost democrats every branch of gov.
#AmExit from the UN
If it undermines your ally to ask them to adhere to the rule of law, why are they your ally?
what will be done to correct this?
@WendyDamron Obama is pure evil !
@UN  #DumpUN #DontFundUN
@UN this is something we should have done a long, long time ago. Now is the time. #defundtheUN
@UN https://goo.gl/tAagQR  Israel,  makes public 200,000 documents on missing Yemenite children
@UN You don't get to talk about shameful legacy when you deny climate change science.
Americans must ensure that never-ever in future they should elect a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing>Disguised-Jihadi-Obam
.@SenTedCruz @UN Israel, an "ally"? #USSLiberty! #DivorceIsrael! #DivorceKSA!
they should all read Richard Herman Jr,"s book FIREBREAK.
Why did 71% of Jews vote for Hitlery? This is why I am beginning not to feel sympathy for them. They lay their own bed.
@UN They are an oppressive regime. They sterilize blacks under the guise of flu shots. They are colonizing Palestine.
smh....what a disgrace
Goofy alias Ob ama has been a notorious fascist pro-Is lamic criminal appeaser and anti-Christian,Buddhist,Hindu.
@UN  no Teddy, H/x will record that constricting the Israelites was the proper course of action. Palastinians are people too.
Yes! God is watching! 

@SenTedCruz
@UN we need to remember all those that stood against Israel when they need the US to stand with them we then need to walk away.
it was the inevitable result of Mr. Netanyahu’s own stubborn defiance of international concerns with @Potus's policies.
It is time for the US to #DefundUN
@UN Wholeheartedly echo your statements on BHO's shameful & despicable anti-Semitic war against great nation & people of Israel.
Ted Cruz the slithery snake who undermines his own country sucks sucks
Bullsh*t the only reason Israel with Bibi in charge will even consider them our ally is the billions that we give him
@UN your support of them is one more reason you will not get my vote come reelection.

the settlement s are illegal. Do you support illegality?
@UN exactly!
@UN we stand with Israel 
@UN And to lable a friend NOT bolstering his friend's error "shameful" or "appalling"? Stupidity o'th'first water.
Thank you for caring & working so hard to help our valuable ally in the Middle East.
@UN you misuse my money every day! Prove how Obama did it.
and their country will be gathered with the Goat nations that the Scriptures speak about!
@UN l hope now people will see that Obama is an enemy of Israel and of the United States of America! Obama is a disgrace!
So was Reagan an enemy of Israel with his 21 UN resolutions critical of Israel, compared to Obamas 1 absentation?
America must be held responsible for allowing Obama to place an Iran Nuke hovering above Israel. DeNial is not a river in Egypt.
@UN how you can justify grabbing homes and land to built settlements. !!??
@UN The U.N. is a farce, and should not get our Funds. This perpetual hate by the Arab Regime, supported by Pres. Obama's veto.
@UN You are so of bullshit Teddy
@UN tell it like it is. Love Cruz
You stand up for this but you could not stand up and let a Black man succeed, shame on you and I am glad you lost.
Defund UN NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just like the thousands of Vets that died & are still dying on your watch TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz while you sit on your ass & do nothing.

@kjon1234561234 @BrianLeyh3 The UN has been a joke for years. We will follow our own foreign policy. Screw them.
@UN This coming from a man with the spine of a jellyfish. Doesn't Trump need his shoes shined?
@sunbeltgirl @UN Israel can protect itself,but USA is committed to helping Israel against barbarian Muslims. Trump will help win
WH+BHO+Kerry all betrayed Israel and frankly the US with its pro Islamist policies.  No one will miss them who has sanity left.
Time to kick ass and take down names!
And I will repay says the Eternal...
true
interesting you support a country that gives abortion on demand.
@UN Well, you're an expert on shameful legacies...you've got one of the biggest ones.
vote these out!! TERM LIMITS 1ST THING!! Israel we USA do love you!! BEBE  WE love you!! God Bless Israel & USA!!♡♡♡
@UN yes I agree. POTUS also continues to divide our nation with his dark hearted actins.

You know who has a shameful legacy...YOU DO.
You shut down the Government preventing visitors from seeing our National Parks.
we better pull out of the UN before they have control of our country. The UN no longer represents the US and our values.
Time to dump the @UN.
@SoniaPennell  
Wouldn't worry as much about legacy; as G_d's wrath and curse on those who curse Israel! #UN and Hussain Obama.
Oh please. You mean the country that Obama green-lighted billions of military aid to and has had a blank check in the region?
The Nazi Socialist Democratic Party (former DNC)  should pay for this. Jewish people must remember what was done to them.
don't you have some tourists to haul around in central park?
@UN Mr.Cruz the bible teaches to stand for justice even if be against your own brother. Now stand for justice with Palestine.
@UN didn't your pappy have a shameful legacy of conspiring to kill JFK??Loser
Well, history has recorded your shameful support of Trump.
@BrianASpeer the billions they get in miltary aid should prove a comfort
Yes, I agree with Senator #TedCruz
Cut off spending for the UN, kick the UN out of the US and cease sending money to the 14 nations that supported this.
@UN what you expect from the worst president since president carter.
Stop every penny USA gives to the UN. To the last drop
@jjauthor @UN --well said Mr. Cruz! The @UN needs to get the hell out of the US! The US needs to leave the UN
Yes let us follow Trump and his minions. Blue up the world instead. Great idea! I hate Trump!
@GigiTracyXO --ahh, another snowflake and its 69 degrees here
No it is 30  & snowing here. No snowflake ! Just some one who has lived 72 yrs & never saw the likes of this insane man! You will see!
-I agree, Obama has been a disaster
Ha ha ha! Enjoy your peace before the shit storm Trump will create. He is mentally ill. You will find out very soon ! He will fail!
--lol, you need to be put out to pasture.
Get us OUT of that muslim dictatorship!!!! #DumpTheUN  @SenTedCruz @jjauthor @UN
Obama continues voting "Present" in all forums.
@UN I hope Trump first move is to defund the UN!
This Is Honestly Incorrect False Flag Information Dude...
Well stated Ted! There is nothing as disgraceful as Barry and his government. Can we survive another 28 days? Must stop Barry!
time to act now! Obama is mentally unstable, limit his powers to packing his bag
Ha ha ha! Mr "I can shoot someone on 5th Ave and not lose a vote ". Is perfectly sane! Trump is a narcissistic egomaniac! He will fail!
@UN really?  Are you forgetting the many more critical resolutions under Reagan and bush?  Ridiculous.
And how about your own shameful legacy undermining US democracy and world order by enabling and supporting the orange blob?
It was the planned and designed by President Obama.
@UN I trust President Trump will screw up these morons bc they've been allowed to screw us-Thank God for a such strong,decent WH
Come on Sen. Ted. You really want to be USSCJ right?
if Obama wanted to smack Israel down like a dog it wouldve done it years ago. This was just the end of the road of Bibis choices
It's definitely time we withdraw our nation from the @UN . They have grossly misused power ,their leftist preference is clear
Never thought Obama would do something like this. Betrayal of Israel, fail of Obamacare & 2xing the debt to 20 trillion = legacy
better yet God is watching
The real Obama has shown his true colors as a  cowardly hate filled foe of our friends in Israel.
@BarackObama Obama's continued anti-semitic actions have done more for terrorism than the terrorists.
Yeah right fat A$$!
You are working for me A$$ Hole, not Israel!
Enter a bill, today, in congress in support of Israel's settlements.  Thwart Obama and U.N..
#cutoffallunfunding

Pretty clear that the Pres/Hillary made $$ deals w/ anti-Israel nations...their buds don't want them discussing "radical Islam."
"Tis the season"... To pander to your Christian base.
#luciferinthflesh
#LuciferInTheFlesh #MiserableSOB #MinorIvy
@UN And how has Israel conducted itself in good faith? Or is it all about its US backed bravado?
@UN
I wish you all would be that outraged with Russia after messing with our election, and investigate DT.
#StandWithIsrael
