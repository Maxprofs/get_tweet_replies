Go Texas Go.. If yoy ever secede I am going with you!
.@Robotbeat @nicholasprop @GovAbbott @SenTedCruz Why would Texas take you, since you'd be a human being? #HumanCrisis
go live in iraq or syria if you love them so much.. They will gladly behead you!
are you telling me you are a CHRISTian?
You're a chickenshit, dirty SOB. Zero evidence the refugees pose a threat. 60% of them are CHILDREN. Shameful! @GovAbbott @CNN @MSNBC @ABC
Sorry your facts are wrong 72% are men
Sorry, it is in fact you that are wrong: http://www.factcheck.org/2015/09/stretching-facts-on-syrian-refugees/ … Verify at http://unhcr.org 
Most are not even Refugees I Know my facts
I mean, do you have evidence? Or are your facts, opinions? You can have a fact-less opinion. Its ok.
My friends in Uk France Paris Germany see first hand Young men Most not even refugees few women kids
Honestly, you're just wrong. The eye test is almost always wrong with this, which is why we count.
Sorry your wrong cant trust the count Look just other day Let 1800 Illegals Criminal citizenship  Deport
using xenophobic myths to turning your back on the world's most vulnerable is unChristian & unAmerican.
@TIME
exactly, our vetting process is very stringent, as the article you cited shows. Thank you.
So let's see you give to missions, Christian service groups, and others that help those people. I'll wait.
nothing wrong with giving to service orgs. They can't meet the need alone, and we are more than able to help.
Do you mean "we the people"?
'Cause we're not, not like you're talking about.
We want a safe and secure nation.
Syrian refugees are not a national security threat, no matter how many lies @GregAbbott_TX  pushes http://m.state.gov/md255967.htm 
We don't trust the gov't. The shocking thing is, you seem to.
If you think the Christian faith should influence Texas politics, you should steer Texas toward embracing refugees.
.@cjonespayne @GovAbbott If you think the Christian faith should influence Texas politics, you should steer Texas toward embracing humans.
Thank You!  Fight it!
.@GovAbbott If you actually cared about security & public safety, you would push for universal background checks for all gun sales.
You ARE the best Governor we have EVER had!!  God Bless You, your family and friends.
why don’t you just secede from the union? The rest of the country hates you.
Are you taking your meds mike? Relax.
Shameful. Absolutely shameful.
Thank you Governor!  God Bless Texas.  "Give Me Liberty, or Come & Take It!" @DineshDSouza @ericmetaxas @DavidLimbaugh
Your the man Governor, your the man.
fuck you...
How about proper education, training and better pay for our law enforcement officers?  #peace
@repubdefector @GovAbbott No man or woman shall write my epitaph.
Amen Governor, God Bless You and God Bless the U.S.A.
why don't all you people that don't like the gov decision open your door and let them live on your land ??
oh please, 5 police officers died in dallas & you ignore chief brown. Your "security" cries are empty.
it's about time
security? Human security? Or security from people who are different from you
Matthew 25: 35 I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
Yeah you forgot that they dont read from that book, theirs says kill infidels (that's us) no matter what
@SenTedCruz Abbott is a #LowEnergy dimwit #TedsDadKilledJFK #Sellout
@crypto_rambo refugees are a devious plan to destroy our country
: Let's hope others governors will follow, at least until @realDonaldTrump is President & can start his extreme vetting process!!
All 50 states should follow your lead Greg!
Have You Told Your citizens about the radioactive Frack water in their drinking water yet ?
Better Yet Secede . So we Can pull all federal assets out of TX. Go rogue We Know where the wall needs built
@magnifier661  DO you think you can convince Govenor in Michigan to do the same??
United States not Federal Plundering
.@GovAbbott @SenTedCruz Worried about #refugees sirs? Then stop denying #climatechange – the #Pentagon doesn’t! http://tinyurl.com/p5qlyz9

- One can only hope that other States follow Texas lead!  Thank you Gov. Abbott!
Terrorists are hiding within refugees. Citizens of TX are lucky to have you as Gov. Saving taxpayers $$$. and providing safety.
grow up! These are innocent people who have no choice but to move to STAY ALIVE & you attempt to manipulate publ opinion #fear
try someone without awareness. Propaganda won't work here  #peace #love #troll #innocentpeople #refugee
@trump2016fan @ConservativeDom no one believes your propaganda. Meet an innocent person fleeing war sometime 
.That's my Governor!  You have my complete support, Governor Abbott.
Dont you mean GOP govts top priority is keeping people scared while ignoring actual issues?
GOOD JOB. FINALLY government putting AMERICANS FIRST!!!
dam right
Sir I applaud you on putting your citizens of your great state Texas and the USA safety first, America first !!
I wish there were more like you, Governor.
Definitely the right move. We thank you, Gov. Keep up the good work!
thank you for caring about your citizens as a Texas registered voter I am very pleased that you are putting us first
As a Texan, I am glad our Gov.decided to do something about this.Thx http://Gov.Abbott ! @AuthorSLevesque @sherryleveck
.@regdfrazier @GovAbbott Enough problems domestically; why more humans, FIX AMERICA 1st! Only nation bldg should b here in the USA!
@Eyes_of_justice Plz talk to Gov. Bevins of my state and encourage He do the same!!
U R thwarting the Islamists trojan horse.  BHO has no clue as 2 what he is doing because if he does know, then we R in bad shape.
If FDR can B a POTUS in a wheelchair, U too can be a POTUS in a wheelchair. I hope U can make it happen. You R greater than FDR!
We moved 2 TX 2 B in the right place should our dictator POTUS pushes us to the brink of secession. TX was once a great nation.
Go, Gov Abbott! You R showing great leadership. BHO needs 2 B put in his place. He is turning the USA into a 3rd World country.
@wordsmithdave thank you
You are the best. I have such respect for you.
God Bless You and thank you for protecting  and securing our great state!!
I agree with Texas 
Texas can do it Governor Abbott, we support you!
@TrumpMyPres 
Thanks Gov. Abbott for standing up for national security!! Your a true Patriot!
It's all about future votes
~@GovAbbott How deplorable of you.
Coward.
My family and I thank you for your efforts,Mr Governor!!
As a fellow Texan, I thank you for standing up to Obama, and withdrawing from the refugee program. Thank you!
@Chris11962 
PLEASE WITHDRAW!!!!
ah how "christian" of you.
Way to take the coward's way out. I thought Texans were supposed to brave and tough.
I would encourage you to read Exodus 9.
fear is not a value. Ignorance is not a value. Hatred is not a value. Your leadership is without value.
a governments top priority should be the prosperity of they people it serves... Not denying safety to people from war
you're a monster and a coward
Good Call Greg ,
Don't argue with air heads, they really are brain washed & they never listen to the real facts. Like talking to a wall, Liberals?

@BBRH123 its better than CNN shit that lies
@BBRH123 the terrorists come in with refugees I'm not going to take that risk!
@BBRH123 our vetting system is a joke!
@BBRH123 good! Send them back!
so the whole Christian love thing goes out the window eh?
Wow a politician with common sense, so rare these days.
Nothing like supporting hate and intolerance. You are the governor and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Good.
dont close the borders until I get there! #Texit
All this will accomplish is the loss of federal funding.  Refugees will be settled here without state help anyway.
Stop promoting ur political agenda in expense of innocent lives
I wish every State would take the same stance, too.   It costs taxpayers over $60,000 to resettle Each refugee here.
@KarenDoe50 brilliant and courageous move!!! ♡♡♡
And the vast majority of Texans are in support of this move to stop sloppy vetting of proven dangerous immigration's.
hope @nikkihaley follows your lead!
please call @JerryBrownGov and ask him to join you!
So, one of these Governors is extremely right, and the other extremely wrong.
@winwarchr get rid of all of the refugees we currently have, send them back to their own countries
@CashBama great idea! All states should with draw from the refugee program, alert your senators, stop Obama planting Muslims
Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Psalm 82:3
Abbott you are not a Christian.
You are an incredible Governor! Maybe you can call Mary @GovMaryFallin? She might join you!
.@GovAbbott This is absolutely despicable, inhumane behavior. It's morally unacceptable to turn away the poor, hungry, & sick. Shame on us.
Thx for standing up for Texans & USA!
we should have never agreed to be in it .we don't need them they don't contribute enough.
EXCELLENT
  #France:  #Paris   Muslims wage #migration #hijrah #jihad. #France will fall  https://amp.twimg.com/v/b13bcd1e-a36c-4ce3-a0ee-2594b7147d58 … … … …
I am  told Fed's run resettlement programs.States have no control. Same deal sanctuary cities .Bad policy.
How does Miss. Gov. Keep them out? I heard him say he just says No.No More Immigrants
thank you for looking out for We The People
All of these horror..from Syrian migrants..do not call them refugees..they are all military age men..one desire..to kill us.

Thank you Gov. Abbott. Now we will see how many other Governors follow the Great State of Texas in Securing the nation.
yeah for Texas! But will you stand tall when ocrapo attacks you or fold like most do?

well done! An excellent decision
Exactly Right. All states should.
I could not be more proud of #Texas for standing up and being an example to the rest of the nation.
I hope more states follow your lead, thank you Governor Greg Abbott
why the hell isn't everyone withdrawing????
What took you so long. We need a Tex it
@Aundria_Hamby OMG!  so refreshing to hear common sense!
I can't even fathom this way of thinking coming from our Politicians! Time to throw all of you out of office! @GovAbbott
I'm loving you now!  Thank you Gov for putting the interests of your citizens before money or political correctness.
Can YOU tell me why this is being done with 48 M AMERICANS on food stamps & 94 M not already working???
withdraw?   Shouldn't have been part to begin.  You betrayed us.
*Pats Texas on the back, shoulders, hands, cheeks, butt, etc. *
you're a pandering coward.
Thank you, Governor!
THANK YOU GOVERNOR ABBOTT FOR BEING A TRUE TEXAN AND PROTECTING OUR STATE!  PROUD TO BE A TEXAN!
well played, guv
@markagallolv no most are terrorists that wants to kill children
@markagallolv go Texas go you're doing good other States need to as well!
just an opinion but a little late Sir.
I seriously need to move to Texas.
-Thanks 
-Thank you 4defending Texans first! Obama's illegal voters can stay in their own country w/ safe military zones. Textit sounds
A governor that will protect US Citizens in their their own homeland!It is a shame that Obama will not do the same 4 US Citizens.
Is history repeating?  1939 US turns away 908 Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany on ocean liner MS St Louis.
Muslim refugees are an Islamic invasion!! Islam is evil. Muslims reject Christ as God & King.
Another reason I'd love to move to Texas.
coward
Obama don't give a fuck if Americans die
@julieagannon especially with refugees from an area where Christians are first victims but only 7% are Christian refugees
Awesome!! Leading the way!!
@magnifier661  My sister is in Dallas right now and says Muslims are everywhere.
finally someone with a brain get's it
@Art05hr3d God bless you and your family I hope you are doing well
@SteveDeaceShow excellent! Thank you, Govenor, for doing what we've asked.
there goes about 1000 jobs...way to go GOV.

.I hope @FLGovScott does the same.
You have no remorse for refugees who came from war worn country. Shame on you!! #AbbottFakeChristian #AbbottColdHeart
The State of Texas already kills more than enough citizens to qualify as a terrorist state. Why are you afraid?
in other words, you've let the terrorists win?
government's top priority should be packing you into a DHL box and mailing you to Raqqa.
No, I think your top priority is good old fashioned racism...
Thanks for unblocking me so I can remind you that you're an abhorrent monster!
Thank you for your strong stance
@nogeese Terrific news, Gov! What took so long? And WHY are you waiting 6 mos to enforce? That lets Obama dump all he wants.
Gov, why such a long delay? O wants another 100,000 starting Oct 1. He'll prob send them all to TX just to show you.
Thought you were a man of God? Who would Jesus deny?

I've got a basket full of other deplorables right here...jump in, you should feel right at home.
@vjeannek thank you sir!
Look at all the tough guys in this TL, scared shitless of a bunch of brown skinned kids escaping hell.
This is cowardly and unworthy of the people of this state.
You lie like the cheap rug on @realDonaldTrump's head.
My governor has "confidence" in the corrupt Obama administration to protect his citizens. #ChattanoogaStrong @BillHaslam
dick
