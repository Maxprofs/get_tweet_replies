@SenTedCruz Why doesn't Congress do anything about him releasing Gitmo prisoners?  This doesn't benefit anyone but Islamist Jihadists
@SenTedCruz - Ted "Slick Harvard Lawyer Who Hid Campaign Loans from Citigroup & Goldman Sachs" Cruz is lying.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS flat tax will only hurt the poor and middle class rich keep getting richer. Look at the big picture

@EmfingerSScout @SenTedCruz Too bad congress refuses to use its power to check and balance the executive branch.
@SenTedCruz @EmfingerSScout Obama is trying to restore the monarchy. His rule is the law, not that silly Constitution.

@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted Cruz is not one to let facts get in the way of his stupidity.. Go back to Canada....
@SenTedCruz, this @POTUS has issued fewer executive orders than many of his predecessors.
@SenTedCruz @LoveuLynn The courts must strike them all down.  Dictator Obama must be stopped..!!!
@SenTedCruz *endless? Try 227. That's less than #georgebush and average for a Presidency during a #wartime period. #Election2016 #getreal
@SenTedCruz @POTUS so have many in congress  corporate  greed!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS This joker has his own agenda. He can't be this incompetent and out of touch. He has evil intentions towards America.
@SenTedCruz He still hasn't issued as many as Ronald Reagan & other presidents!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama made fewer executive orders per year than any POTUS since Grover Cleveland, you bile spewing dolt. #factcheck
@SenTedCruz the  @POTUS has issued far less than half what Regan & Bush jr in their first term over two so what else you got?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS because no republican president ever issued executive orders...no never...crazy thought...fact checkers anywhere...?
get'em @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you are a liar Cruz.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you should concentrate on creating not criticizing.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS obama is that dangerous confluence of arrogance and ignorance.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS check your facts before you offer your input. Obama signed less than most
@SenTedCruz @POTUS People need to understand how he utilizes Memorandum which carry the same weight but allow him to claim less exec orders.
@SenTedCruz When you throw stones from inside a glass house, you’re obviously not very bright.

@tedcruz gives lip service to 'Audit The Fed' yet has rejected showing up for a vote.

#StandWithRand
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obamas issued 226 executive orders. Your man crush Reagan issued 381.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and nothing is ever done to stop this menace,less talk and more action
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Gosh, I suppose NO Republican President EVER issued an Exec Order or circumvented the Constitution. Oh wait. All of them.
@SenTedCruz You are completely full of shit.
@SenTedCruz Go back to Canada with your LIES!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS The current anti-American, disloyal opposition in Congress has necessitated that, Teddy.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS : Does this mean you promise not to issue any?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Yet congress yielded many of its powers to earlier presidents because, like you, they were cowards. XOs used for decades.
@SenTedCruz And no other president has done that, right?  Learn about your adopted country's political history.  #clown #republicans #USA
@SenTedCruz That's what he considers leadership & working together.
@SenTedCruz you're pretty much an eternal liar. Obama issued almost 1/2 the orders W did. And 1/3 of Clinton's. you're not even eligible
@SenTedCruz  MORE LIES BY CRUZ .
@SenTedCruz @POTUS why does congress keep kissn his (_|_)?Ryan gave him as much as pelosi ever did or more! Wtf?

@SenTedCruz Did you support the Audit the Fed vote?
@SenTedCruz What @POTUS seems to have forgotten is that the gov't is beholden to the People, not the other way around
@SenTedCruz And, why not...NO ONE STOPS HIM!   Obvious that some people ARE above the law.
@SenTedCruz You are going to be President. I want to be an Ambassadour, don't care where. Please get staff to contact me for vetting. Thanks
Buhari has put Nnamdi Kanu into the same cell with harden abandon Boko-Haram Members # free Mr. Kanu # free Biafra @sentedcruz
@SenTedCruz shhhhhhh remain calm all will be well. Shhhhh.
@SenTedCruz 
And unless he gets punished in any way then those limits don't actually exist.
@SenTedCruz 
Rules without punishments are not rules.
@SenTedCruz 
But you're not going to punish him for "reasons", and I guess you're going to self impose those limits on yourself too.
@SenTedCruz 
Absolutely fucking pointless.
@SenTedCruz You'd know all about ignoring...like your job as senator and voting for audit the fed...
@SenTedCruz 
What's new senator.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS elections have consequences
