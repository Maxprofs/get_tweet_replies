Health insurance has NEVER been & should NEVER be a federal right regardless of how much the socialist howl for it. #FreeMarketCapitalism 
Gov pays 72% of the cost of Congress healthcare.

Pigs at the Gov trough!

#BeyondThePale
Pretty sure Cruz Texas wouldn't miss u
Fox is fake news



You're so angry
I doubt your thoughts will change from taking away healthcare from millions to provide tax breaks for the wealthy. #gonein2018

Taking by everything away from poor people?  Mean Ted!
No thanks. I don't want to know what you're doing with my healthcare.
Tool of fake admin on fake airwaves pushing fake news.

This Texan does not agree with your position on healthcare.
Hey! Get your act in gear. We need you to kick some estab rino butt! The repuke party is effeminently superflous. You only one with guts.
Creeps like Cruz want to take away your ability to buy healthcare, but get their own healthcare subsidized by gov.

#hypocrites  #corrupt
Ur embarrassing
How about producing the plan that yall have. McCain dont have O care he didnt use va both are broke
Mr we want you and all republicans to support repeal and replace Obamacare we don't want you guys playing game with president
"My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."-- Thomas Jefferson
He the government out of government!!!compleatly!
Just repeal.  Fed gov needs to get out of the way.  Period. They ruin everything they touch.
Sen. Cruz...you better VOTE to repeal AND REPLACE Obamacare, period...with or without YOUR ammendments...I am a Texas Voter, too
Russia will have a field day with your ass!
Ted Cruz you couldn't get elected if you were the only voter...


GOP will be done if they condemn people to death from taking health insurance then they can stick Pro life up there republican ass
Cruz

Your amendment is a disaster.  http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/uneven-playing-field-applying-different-rules-to-competing-health-plans/?utm_campaign=KFF-2017-July-Cruz-Amendment-Pre-Ex&utm_content=57852630&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter …
DEAD IN THE WATER...in part by Medical Insurance Companies!!
You introduced an amendment that would cause total chaos in the markets.  Your thoughts on health care are uninformed.
Next step.  REPEAL Obamacare!!!  @realDonaldTrump
@BetoORourke for Senate 2018! #CruzMustGo
From a guy who enjoyed Ocare wen his wife lost their health insurance!
For your new & improved way to kill more Americans by denying them healthcare by giving tax breaks to the rich? I'd rather be shot
Wish rep sen would stop cursing themselves with election losses, we need trump republicans not dems or establishment rep. @KatiePavlich
Thank you @SenTedCruz for standing by your word.
Your "next steps" lead us off the cliff. Just stop.
Can you name ONE insurance company who guarantees better coverage cheaper for everyone in Texas if ACA is repealed? They are strangely quiet

Please come on 1 of the 257 other media outlets with your thoughts.....
Watch ole Ted.  I don't trust him.
Do you actually have thoughts on healthcare or do you just act on your impulses to create these comically unworkable "solutions"?
NEVER
It's not healthcare it a tax cut for the wealthy, just trying to figure out how many deaths are worth
Why?
Nahhh
spread those lies on the #1 fake news channel in America! MRGA! Pathetic and can't wait to get you out of texas office next year!
Your thoughts are, you and the GOP is not behind the President! If you're not behind the President you're not behind 60 million voters!DTS
Well we all know Trumps not going to listen to " Lying Ted "
I'd rather drink sewage water. But thanks for the invite anyway.
next step: feed Kibbles to the sick and elderly who have been kicked off health care. to be announced w/ ted's usual sanctimonious piety...

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
And for those of us self employed who participate in a co-op health care program, repeal the mandate!  We have coverage...think of US!
Did you tell them why you have exempted yourselves from you BS healthcare plan?
Rafael, you actually have thoughts, but no ethics.
I couldn't wait any longer. tired of them always saying Cruz will be on "next" and he never is, tired of the never ending commercials
Ted's the man!!! #CruzIsRIGHT #TrusTed
You and the Senate & House needs No Must get REPEAL & REPLACE on OBAMA Don't Care Conpleted - NOW
We must repeal #Obamacare - a stepping stone to a single-payer healthcare system which will kill us all #CharlieGard https://rawstreetjournal.com/single-payer-healthcare-system-kill-us/ …
I never watch Faux News.
Heard it, loved it, now fix it!
tell us about the healthcare lobbyist that r all ova u like white on rice
Thats okay I like real news and Senators who dont collude against America and take away healthcare from 25 million. #traitor #trumprussia

Annihilate health care. Yeah we a get how extremely sinister and hateful you can be just to get into the news. #creepy #communist #pathetic
Two words Tort Reform.  This has made the cost of health care explode. Lawyers, as you know have a powerful lobby in DC.
watched you on Fox, great idea! Keep pushing Mr. Cruz, praying for you!
Can you guys get a couch that you sit comfortable  instead of sitting on the edge looking like your ready t take off
The next step is REPEAL.
Your amendment demonstrates a lack of understanding of health insurance.
@realDonaldTrump @VP Mike "Nuremberg Laws" Pence Republican Healthcare Plan, Republicans KILL MILLIONS TO STEAL BILLIONS
I got this at the end of the segment
Explain this.
Omg you are so funny, omg so smart. I saw that like 20 times but when you did it you are, wow, really special!! Crying!! Gosh you're so....

Cruz is the biggest pussy Trump has grabbed against their will. Must be easier to bend over without a spine
