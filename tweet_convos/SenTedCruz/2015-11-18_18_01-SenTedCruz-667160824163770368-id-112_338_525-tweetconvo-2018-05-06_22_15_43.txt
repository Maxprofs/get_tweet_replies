@SenTedCruz what is your plan Felito?
@SenTedCruz They want to come here for a better life. Quick, Senator Chickenshit, be a hero and turn them away!
@SenTedCruz Obama needs to be removed from office. He does not care about the safety of Americans, Just his sick Communist legacy!!
@SenTedCruz your line of bullshit is the greatest threat free Americans face
@SenTedCruz You don't even allow those most basic steps to happen with gun control! #SyrianRefugees Xenophobia needs to go and so do you.
@SenTedCruz @neo99934 I believe it's here Senator! Stock up on Ammo! God Bless Texas!!
@SenTedCruz Bring in only women and children
@SenTedCruz Ted, your offensive.
@SenTedCruz your family immigrated from Cuba, one could say you are potential communist, SHUT UP already-you will never be President @POTUS
.@SenTedCruz keep up the good work, dummy
@SenTedCruz HOW? OBAMA WON'T AGREE WITH IT. CONGRESS IS SCARED FOR SOME REASON
@SenTedCruz Islam is the problem not just refugees.
.@SenTedCruz Those steps should NEVER include surrendering our core values & playing right into the hands of the terrorists we want to beat.
@SenTedCruz Time to impeach Obama and his entire administration. Egregious offenses toward United States. Our future & existence is at stake
@SenTedCruz @SMLBound why not just say Islam Muslims!
@SenTedCruz POTUS needs to pass through Global Entry to see what honest people (citizens) spend days doing & stress over.
@SenTedCruz You mean radical extremists period. What about the ones INSIDE our borders, shooting up our schools and universities???
@SenTedCruz I support u senator Cruz just stay strong and continue to use your influence to protect USA
@SenTedCruz The TRIP plan by Petra Lazlohttps://youtu.be/ArQmFlp7xC8
@SenTedCruz Nice to hear somebody with some guts actually stand up for America & not sell us out. Trump-Cruz in 2016 just the ticket for me!
@SenTedCruz empty words you didn't say anything
@SenTedCruz why don't you give up your paycheck that you are not earning anyways while U are running for president. Terrorism is everywhere.
@SenTedCruz 
Koran : kill infidels ,ok to lie to infidels ,definition of conspiracy
Deception .Run all muslims out of USA .Kill them first

@SenTedCruz They want us to be afraid. Keep calm and carry on.
@SenTedCruz Rubio is a democrat in disguise, he has no real conservative values. Promote that you are pro legal Latinos
@SenTedCruz You should be promoting more that you are Cuban. Promote that you are a LATINO REPUBLICAN. Don't let cup cake Rubio control that
@SenTedCruz Let's hope that this is not politicized and that POTUS does not veto.
@SenTedCruz Yeah like exercising our 2A rights to the letter! No more of this disarming #guncontrol!!?
@SenTedCruz:, isn't it time to say the " i-word"?  Impeach now before we end up with a dictator.
@SenTedCruz we already do
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Stop bombing other countries like Syria and killing innocent citizens then accepting the refugees who won't be happy for a start
@SenTedCruz Just upholding existing laws would be a good step. I watched someone pledge to do that twice with his hand on a Bible.
@SenTedCruz Maybe  Q'uran would have been better.
@SenTedCruz Close our borders now! We are $20 Trillion dollars in debt. Refugees to Africa instead.
@SenTedCruz with you
@SenTedCruz  Yes this is why its crucial for the Republicans to win the White House in 2016  Trump/Cruz
@SenTedCruz We need to remove the UN from the US and pass bill to remove citizenship
@SenTedCruz #NoMuslimRefugees  Please!!
@SenTedCruz What a shame that #ImpeachObama hates America & it's people so much, that it has to come to this to protect the people.
@SenTedCruz So we create the mess and then make sure they can't leave?
@SenTedCruz vests?
@SenTedCruz Start by cutting the head off the snake... Impeach Obama for aiding the enemy.
@SenTedCruz how about getting Congress to grow a pair and impeach Obama. Are they afraid of protests and looting, there's a way to fix that
@SenTedCruz Trump's Plan is being implemented by Russia, they will capture and keep oil fields & all land N&S&E&W & clean the terrorists out
@SenTedCruz how about accepting 20K Orphans under 12
@SenTedCruz How bout accepting 20K Orphans under 12
@SenTedCruz you too dumb or too dishonest to admit the biggest threat to the American people is the CIA and the Military industrial complex?
@SenTedCruz Especially when the current POTUS won't.
@SenTedCruz Trump/Cruz ticket 2016 !
@SenTedCruz it's time to quit messing around and arrest Obama and all his staff
@SenTedCruz yes we do, before its to late!! Thank you
@SenTedCruz isn't it obvious to everyone by now that Obama is for Islamic terrorism
@SenTedCruz please keep up the pressure in Washington. We need to stay hyper vigilant.
@SenTedCruz Chickenshit.
@SenTedCruz Seems Obama is waging Jihad on America with his recent speech and actions.
@SenTedCruz What about the epidemic of rapes / killings by American law enforcement? American cops are a National Security Threat - jd
@SenTedCruz amen, the basic steps (1) #ShieldsUP (2) #DefeatISIS
@SenTedCruz One of which is not giving into the fear their terror tries to create. #rememberourvalues #defeatfear
@SenTedCruz I'm more concerned with radical GOPers.
@SenTedCruz Thank you Senator Cruz, you are one of few men in politics with integrity.
@SenTedCruz #youlie Hell, you won't even do anything to protect US from domestic terrorism. #gop #dnc #POTUS #nra
@SenTedCruz 
You don't know your real enemy.
The real enemy is Islam(not some Muslims); it has millions of times more evils than nazism.

@SenTedCruz Obama's vetting process

@SenTedCruz We need to take necessary steps to protect us from Right Wing Extremists.
@SenTedCruz

@SenTedCruz We have a lawless & unconstitutional POTUS that is committing treason against the American ppl. #ImpeachObama #Tcot #Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz Obama won't say anything bad to your face, he's a lying twirp POS! Do all you can Sen. to stop this madness all brought on by O!
@SenTedCruz Will they be able to bring up to 4 wives and will the US be forced to recognize them all?
@SenTedCruz If you want to protect the American people & make it a safer world vote to impeach Obama.
@SenTedCruz how can we do that when our president won't protect us?
@SenTedCruz urgent see this tweet from Gov Abbott

@sentedcruz The House of Representatives has the power to impeach for misconduct do it
@SenTedCruz absolutely correct, Mr President! (you better get used to being called that)  ;-)
@SenTedCruz I agree 100%!
@SenTedCruz What do we have to do to impeach this traitor? He's completely dismissive of our concerns and punitive! Disrespect for Americans
@kamori01 @sentedcruz The House of Representatives can do it they have to have a majority and prove misconduct
@SHORTYROCKLOPEZ @SenTedCruz Can we, the American People, sue for Impeachment?
@SenTedCruz Ted thanks for standing with Israel
