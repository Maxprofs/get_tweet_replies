, Chiefs Is it Gen Lawrence Snowden or Semper Fedelis ,Sir
I hear alot of talk about ppl lost in 2016...Somehow this REAL hero got a little lost in the shuffle among the celebrities..
It takes armed forces discipline to be able to follow through with all those things. Much respect for this man.
Tpdau he is lying in State of Ohio, for now, till he is buried. Semper Fi.
R. I.P.
