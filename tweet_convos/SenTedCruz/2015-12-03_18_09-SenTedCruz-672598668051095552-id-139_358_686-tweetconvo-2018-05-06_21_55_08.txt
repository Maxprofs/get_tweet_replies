@SenTedCruz @Texas4Cruz If you are successful, assume your healthcare insurance which we tax payers pay for will also be terminated.
@JaneMenloPark @SenTedCruz @Texas4Cruz I pay for my own health insurance. Thx.
@Texas4Cruz @SenTedCruz Is that because you are a covered spouse under your wife's Company's private group medical insurance plan?
@SenTedCruz  There you go again.  Working for the People.  Bahahahaha
@SenTedCruz @DavidJMadeira @realDonaldTrump Was this before, after, or during when you & Rubio said no?  What about our Vets? They're dying.
.@SenTedCruz Please dont. People need medical care.
@SenTedCruz the only way to repeal the ACA is to come up with a better plan. Something you're not capable of accomplishing.
@SenTedCruz thank you
@SenTedCruz was Rubio there? None of his offices are taking calls.
@alafiadelight @SenTedCruz Rubio doesn't go to work. In Tampa paper few wks ago story about his constituents can't get any help from him
@Benito35ddDavis @SenTedCruz @marcorubio office hasn't answered the phone for 2 months & voicemail is always full!
@SenTedCruz How Will Cruz make sure that Working/NonWorking Americans have Access 2 Affordable, quality outpt care
@SenTedCruz @Bwdreyer :Obamacare has already done so much irreversible damage to HC premiums for people who had good HC plans.
@SenTedCruz @kksheld We also need to elect @kelliwardaz She will fight 4 our freedoms too! A God Loving Conservative!
@SenTedCruz @kksheld Healthcare cannot deliver equality, but equality can create a system of healthcare. Replace the ACA w/5 Rings of Care
@SenTedCruz let us buy policies free of mandates,across state lines, tailored to individual needs, with a HSA !
@SenTedCruz today good time to dig up video of Obama saying "if it comes down to it, I will stand with Islam"
@SenTedCruz and what's your plan for those without insurance? Ohhh that's right, show up at ER and if they don't take you, you can DIE!!!
@dogwar007 @SenTedCruz make yourself marketable to employers who offer HS as a benefit...a little effort and it's a non-issue
@hedeen89 @SenTedCruz don't ASSume...luckily I'm not in want/need but care about others...unlike some!
@dogwar007 @SenTedCruz gj with the virtue signals. what did I assume again?
@JimBowieTexas @SenTedCruz Never say never
@JimBowieTexas @SenTedCruz It should never have been upheld by the SCOTUS and is completely unconstitutional.
@JimBowieTexas @SenTedCruz Ted Cruz is one of the few that does and I have no respect for SCOTUS at all.
@SenTedCruz @kksheld Let's hope so! I can't believe America let it happen in the first place. #NoObamacare
@SenTedCruz @Phibear94 you are right on! The one who stands consistently on American values! Turn back govt takeover! Takes guts! Ted has!
@SenTedCruz  Cruz Will take Monthly Subsidies away in States Where Medicaid Not Expanded people Will have NO care
@SenTedCruz Cruz Want 2 take away And Deny Americans Access 2 insurance, but Cruz Still wants his Government insurance that is paid 4
@SenTedCruz You miss apostrophe in tweet.
@SenTedCruz How about working on something to replace Obamacare with some form of more affordable health care for millions?

@SenTedCruz Cruz Wants Americans 2 use the ER/HOSPITAL 4 care just like in Texas

@bakerlarry84 @SenTedCruz If you mean open markets across state lines why would you limit right of states to regulate business in own state?

@SenTedCruz You should be in bed, way past your bedtime.
@SenTedCruz you. Forgot. The. Apostrophe. I'm in the #CruzCrew, but you seriously need to tell your staff that apostrophes are important.
@SenTedCruz maybe have something to replace it with first? No that would take governing skills.
@SenTedCruz Sen. Paisley Bathrobe.
@SenTedCruz Waste of time and energy.
@SenTedCruz So what are you going to replace it with?
@SenTedCruz Significant step in what way? A step in the veto process? Are there still huge numbers of people uninsured in Texas?
@SenTedCruz at least if you're gonna let people shoot people then let them have a way to pay for thier recovery Damn #gunsense #TheWizLive
@SenTedCruz You are an embarrassment
