To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Trump has been sabotaging it for the past 6 years? Wow, did not know that.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
You realize you get sub par care from medicaid/medicare right? I mean no place I have worked at ever accepted it.
Link to the SMEs who corroborate your claims #NoCutsToMedicaid  #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
This chart from the CBO report really says it all: low income Americans are asked to pay higher premiums for less generous coverage. 
Ya know for citing Vox a lot you are lucky I don't cite Breitbart.

Senator, ur proposal would be great if we all can see the future and buy for only things that I we'll need to keep the cost down. (1)
I personally do not have the ability to see the future and can't tell what illness I will have. So, I pretty much need to be...(2)
everything except the prostate cancer since I am a female and do not have a prostrate. (3)
I look at healthcare insurance like gambling. I am betting that I will be come ill that will require to financing to cover the cost. (4)
Sometimes patients will cash out cuz they get sick, but many times insurance company win cuz clients are healthy. (6)
What is the point of having insurance if we only buy for the things that we are going to need, such as pregnancy for females? (7)
What about the one that we don't expect to get but we do later? How do I pay for that since it's not be covered? (8)
I don't want a cancer but the reality is that I may get it in the future. Which cancer I may get? Do you know? (9)
Better make sure the Repeal and Replace passes or GOP gets a black eye Bad. Can't let O'care disintegrate and hurt so many people.
@swargcoming @macansharp @cala_1111 @ThatsMissThot2U @Laffingmom @nvrggivup @WGinetta @1RedTulie @tlsg99 Thanks for fighting for us!
We all wish you hadn't sold your soul to the devil.
Hey, let's use donald trumps taxes to pay for healthcare,  oh wait, we can't, he doesn't pay taxes  WRONG
If you lower premiums by providing lesser health plans, how does this benefit anyone?
REPEAL O'Care. If ANY part of O'Care remains we become Europe. No choice; rationing-duty to die in European model will come to US--INHUMANE
My tax dollars go for both the Senate and House in-house healthcare facilities. (1)
i would be against ANY Mandates
You are not solving anything despite your repeated insistence that less is more. We are not that stupid.
How can you solve the problem, that existed before Obama Care, of skyrocketing premiums by restoring to the state before OCare?
Repeal in full. I just heard Mark Levin read the words "compliant" and noncompliant. These words should have nothing to do with health ins.
There's no point paying for insurance that doesn't cover anything.  This will be a win for insurance companies and a big lose for Americans.
The principal concept of health care was to prevent uninsured from using high cost emergency rooms when they get sick by proactively insured
What are Republicans actually proposing to improve health care for Americas, instead of breaking the backs of hard working Americans.
Mr. Cruz, on ABC you said you are proposing to allow paying health care using HSA. We already can do this. See tax code!

Stop it! I mean really stop it! You're the one that's trying to sell us a bill of goods! You keep saying it's a small pool YOU ARE A LIAR!
REPEAL Obamacare.  Your proposal is wrong; stratifies healthcare, leaves O'Care in place for old & sick. Look @ Europe; at baby Charlie Gard
We must work toward a modern World single payer healthcare or Medicare for all. (4)
I demand fair and equal healthcare for all our citizens not the wealthcare of the AHCA or BCRA. (3)
My taxes subsidize 70% of government employees', the Congressman's and his staff's, healthcare insurance. (2)
The only people not talking about the Russians interference are the GOP. Media reports on current issues and this is top of list
Why didn't you proactively work with O and the Dems to improve health care at that time?
You have had seven years to construct a better health care bill.
This is why your presidential run went down in flames. Same obstructionist views that we have seen from Reps for past eight years.
So basically turn exchanges into high risk pools? Not a bad idea but credits would have to change so that reg. plans cost way more than alt.
Repeal completely then add just a few rules like competition across state line. The less the better.
Republicans healthcare system sucks Paul Ryan didn't tell the American people the truth Medicaid would be gone Trump lies
The American people want Trump impeach 25th amendment IMPEACH Trump
Koch Brothers WANTED for Climate Crimes
Just Repeal the darn thing! ACA
Repeal obamacare. Its broken.
You understand that YOU work for US, right? Taking away health care and giving tax bonuses to billionaires isn't supposed to be your job.
Listen!
You are spot on! Thanks!
What happened to torte reform?  Will it happen?
Please do what you said you were going to do as a Party.
Or, "How To Legally Mass-Euthanize Americans"
Of course after a lot of soul searching ... like when he enddorsed Trump...now invent a skimpy plan to help health insurance companies...
In @tedcruz I trust.
Why don't you all propose free market all private individual owned health insurance...no employer and NO government, like Swiss?
You DO know that National Review publishes white nationalist propaganda, right? If they like you, take a good long look in the mirror.
Your proposal is perfectly reasonable to allow bare bone or hospitalization only plans if that's what people want. No mandates or penalties.
Put house and senate on ACA the democrats will repeal it
What a bunch of freakn losers u all r in the Senate 7 yrs and still nothing to show for it.  #Wow #DemsInDisguise #MAGA
You really don't care about the citizens of the USA.  There are so many people in need of care and you are not doing anything for them.
The @SenateGOP have no choice if they want to be re-elected - #REPEALObamacare  
FORCE the lame DEMS to the table.
We need to REPEAL & REPLACE you, lying back-stabbing self-serving #Lucifer You do not help Texans unless it benefits you. #votehimOUT
BETO 2018
How Much Will The Amendment Close The Health Gap? #BlackLivesMatter #Indivisible #WomensMarch
@SenTedCruz @MikeLeeforUtah thank you for standing in the gap to push for free market healthcare. John Smith's "Invisible Hand" works
@SenateGOP taking our liberty & control over our own health away from us, sentencing us to a life controlled by government-No Single Payer
many/most GOP senators would oppose any Cruz proposal out of pure spite
Appalling @GOP senators are claiming their constituents like #Obamacare now-They don't know who their constituents are & have lied to us!
Keep fighting for us. Just got my grandfathered insurance plan of 12 years canceled. Obamacare carnage continues!
@SenTedCruz and @SenMikeLee have the RIGHT PLAN @SenateMajLdr !!! We didn't give you the majority to work with the DEMS!!
We want a list of weak Repubs. not backing repeal & replace. We deplorables are stronger than the media. You will NOT be reelected.
Sleazy Ted, pimping for the Koch brothers, as usual...
so what give every American a bandaid and aspirin and tax break for the wealthy and let it go
When will this be available from the GPO? Interesting proposals If it is good you might get me to consider changing parties. Yeah right LOL
Sons of Liberty!
#FullRepeal for the #tenthamendment. Healthcare should be an individuals issue & a State or charity can provide healthcare for PreCon & poor
how about you all repeal it like you were sent to do and then stay the out of our wallets you are not dictators with the right to force will
Sound like death for 23 million.  You don't care.
Of course it is, it's been put out by the 2 best Senators this country has!
Premiums are low. Why can't we unleash market forces on cost of care? Insurance with a $6,000 deductible isn't insurance.
Work with Dems to fix ACA, make it stronger and better. Promote the general welfare! Don't downgrade Medicaid and Medicare. Help all Texans.
Helping all Texans would be to turn HC or the a real free market. It works everywhere else. Get govt out of healthcare
Anything other than REPEAL of obumercare is a HUGE LIE on the part of taxpayers funded politicians, PERIOD!
Repeal
I trust Senator Cruz to make the right decisions for America.
Ted Cruz and Mike Lee: serving the wealthy while fleecing the public. These guys expect a handsome payoff when they get voted out of office.
Liar 
No!  How many people need to die?
I won't rest until even our pharmacies are male only, the way God intended! 

-@tedcruz <probably>

#BetoForTexas
How much money will you make off of #TrumpCare and sick Americans.
You've got a @SenateMajLdr claiming he won't repeal Obamacare. Sorry Senator Cruz but no repeal, the @GOP will be the minority in 2018.
No doubt
Another co conspirator with Trump -with his approval ratings for 7 mos that will get you far!
O.K. So let's say they can afford the premiums, what are the deductibles?  The whole plan has to be "affordable".  Can't wait to see more. 
Ted it's time to step down! You were used under this administration it over for you. Played by Trump as well as other!!
Love CRUZ
#Repeal #Repeal #Repeal
How you gonna get @SenatorCollins onboard?
Praying that Texas voters kick you out of office
