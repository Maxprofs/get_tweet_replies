Thank you for all your hard work. The real Constitutionalists are with you!
Real Christians are #CruzCrew
OK, I understand standing up for what you believe in, but saying that if you don't support Cruz, ...
If you support evil Trump or Hillary and not a Godly person you damn fool!
Cruz is owned by Globalist Banks like Goldman Sachs.
Have you ever taken out a loan? For anything? Trump took one from George Soros!!
Goldman Sachs owns the Federal Reserve which is why Ted won't vote to Audit it.
I truly hope you are smarter than that. The Fed dwarfs Sachs by many many times over.
Why don't you go stand there for reals? We'll be fine w/out you. It's not like you're keeping US citizens safe. #DisarmHate
@_CFJ_ thank you for always standing with us.

I always knew you were not a US natural-born citizen, and very greedy...should not be in US govt.
AMEN BROTHER, YES WE STAND WITH ISRAEL.
@suscitate What a crock. YOU voted to lower the bar -facilitate passage of Iran nukes. YOU stood w/Obama-Iran-Kerry
just asked wikipedia to change London terrorist attacks to 'terrorist attacks' to match BBCs reports 
This is what Israeli's are putting on prayer walls.
Shalom Yisroel 
me too
love U I didn't want to vote for bush 41, McCain or Romney but voted a straight repub ticket! U and Berry need grow up and ....
Why can't we all just stand for Peace in all of the Middle East?
The ignorant lead by the sociopathic are wrong, battle lines are drawn. first principles concept.
Palestinian people deserve lives of dignity and peace.
it is good you stand with Israel, now, how about standing with the nominee of the party. We are Texans and support you.
Yeah, reminds me of the great work you did keynoting a gala for In Defense of Christians (IDC). You joker
@AIPAC Thank you for not being passive like all other "politicians" who air quote "terrorists".
So do I.
Go stand IN Israel - permanently.
Wow, now isn't that a massive surprise?
Yes and let all US stand with Israel. An enemy of our enemy is our friend. Ask the Prince!
You should stand with the USA.
I concur!
@bakerlarry84v2 

@SenTedCruz  And I'm next to you, sir
@realDonaldTrump Better yet , can you relocate over there?
oh really? when are you going to start calling out  islam and it's crazy followers then?
,,i stand with Isreal, ,RT
Every American president must understand : Israel did not make peace with terrorists and divide the territory.
Thank you!!!! And this is why we stand with you #helpRobmeetTed
How about Trump? Unified or not.
It's not unification to move away from first principles.  The GOP is in error, and has been for some time.
United we stand devided we fall. Trump is the candidate and there's no changing that.
True; yet a man of principle still takes a step back.  The lesser of two evils; both are still evil.  1st Principle
yeah and who determines the evil doesn't it take one to know one Unite for the good of the country
First Principles define balance in the long view, Trump maybe best of crowd; yet we have to work for better.
that's a right position! We must support Israel!
Always!
the one and only magnificent Cruz Control
therefore i stand with you #ChooseCruz
Eat my butt
I agree to stand with america first, Israel has earned our support and respect... We should back our friends
.@SenTedCruz This is why @HillaryClinton must be stopped. #Trump2016 #stophillary2016
Was that in your oath of office?
and at this point trump is acting more like a child than a president
I stand with Israel, always!
apparently Lying Trump have issues with every country
pathetic pandering- of course we Americans stand with all innocent victims of violence
check with Cheney or Netanyahu to find out who's behind this. I'm sure after Hillary's  big night they wanted a new narrative
I stand with Israel!  Would love to see you at the CUFI this year!  I stand with you too!
Thank you from Israel.
I STAND WITH ISRAEL
#IStandWithIsrael Praying for Israel! TedCruz a man of God. #TedCruzforPresident2016
@catalishus @SenTedCruz Pray BibI & Likud get VOTED OUT so Israel has a shot at PEACE.
Yes #IStandWithIsrael
First Principle - be true to the Constitution, not a party that becomes the collective animal raging out of control.
Israel needs everyone support in this sad day.
Thank you for standing for Israel. Me and other Jews really appreciate that.
@catalishus @SenTedCruz "Me" [sic] and other Jews.
why is the rest of the US friends with Israel? They have nothing we need or want and cost taxpayers big $
Little cost for the nature of what we get in intelligence, the moral focus though, is they are us.  think cost benifit
Intel about the middle east is not worth anything unless you go to the middle east, Don't go there, they are not us. no benifit
Why don't you stand with the USA? And you wonder why you lost! LOL
Would you please take your fake crap somewhere else.
I hope you are smart enough to not believe these obvious con artists.
Just like the Canadians that you and I are right?
