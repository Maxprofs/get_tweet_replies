#Fanniegate
Obama stole $1.7B from American taxpayers & gave it to terrorist Iran. Didn't ask Congress @SenTedCruz @sizzlesride @USTreasury @FreeBeacon
@freelancer1787 @USTreasury  Then, "The People" need once & for all to hold this administration accountable. We fund Government
Why slit their own throats, and ours, by giving money to a terrorist regime who pledges to slit all our throats?
@andya09 @USTreasury @FreeBeacon who is controlling our government politicians time for we the people. Cruz jump on board bereal
Obama giveth, and the Clintons taketh away. We must be rid of politician-criminals.
@KatyinIndy @USTreasury That would have helped a lot of needy veterans, elderly, and homeless.
@FreeBeacon THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED IN THIS COUNTRY
Twitter is great for some things, but nt good for making pols feel like they've accomplished some thing. Take Action
Trump is gonna audit and fire every one of those bastards
Yet another blatant waste of taxpayer money being used to fund the ppl that want us dead! What is wrong with ppl?
@tgriddle @USTreasury This party has to end!
Why did you vote to provide average of $9,100 per year in welfare to millions of illegal aliens if you deplore debt?
#IranNukeFund
inexcusable but by all means keep fighting DT so Hillary wins election and she will continue Obama's 3rd term
How does Obama Admin. keep getting away w/ it? After 1st two years, voters delivered House/Senate to GOP!
Jack Lew continues to steal $ in private property from @FannieMae @freddiemac #fanniegate
@FreeBeacon 
@NBCNews @cnnbrk
  WAKE UP AMERICA  
#HILLARY CLINTON IS UNFIT
Ted you are wrong for not supporting Trump. If Hillary wins you are responsible & many other stupid Repubs Kasich,Bushes,Marco
did Obama personally find  Iran not guilty?  Taxpayers paid hostages $$. Iran should have paid this.
@FreeBeacon This admin is so anti-American. #WriteinTed  is what I will be doing.
Devastating! This a crazy game been played here!
@FreeBeacon   my whole family supported you. Very disappointed in your integrity. Can't support you again. 
@FreeBeacon  
That's called structuring financial transactions to conceal payments. #DennyHastert
@FreeBeacon 
Your hearings on Muslim Brotherhood didn't go anywhere.
Was this just another gov't soap opera?
@FreeBeacon 
Seek charges against Obama through Cyber Terrorism for trying to give away our internet rights.
@FreeBeacon 
Impeach Obama Now!
By law Congress funds, so STOP payment.
@FreeBeacon
@kksheld @USTreasury If only there were something you could do about it...
Treason.  Impeach!
"@SenTedCruz @consmover @USTreasury " @SharylAttkisson @JamesRosenFNC @RichardGrenell WTF @jasoninthehouse
Items like this ALWAYS PISS ME OFF! 
Not the criminality or corruption â€” but that half the country just doesn't care
Isn't this merely the settling of long held debts owed to Iran since the 1970's for oil, etc? Seems I read that b4..
@FreeBeacon we all know you are to late go home cruz.
Does 100 million dollars trigger some kind of Congressional audit???  Why 1 penny less?
#youlie  @USTreasury @FreeBeacon Where have you been for the last two years? Please go back.  #gop #dnc #POTUS
@FreeBeacon WAKE UP AMERICA we payed Ransom and others have already been taken, I told you that would happen
Read it backwards see the # 66,666,666.66, same as Obama , The Angel of Light, he can quote verse just like Jesus !
@benshapiro @USTreasury   They would need a 14th transfer of $13.
@FreeBeacon WHY ISN'T HE IMPEACHED!
bigger issue is @realDonaldTrump being your party rep.  Enough said Ted
@FreeBeacon Doesn't congress have control of the funds?  Just tell the treasury to reject his transfer instructions
This admin makes a mockery of our constitution. The pres doesn't have the authority to do this,only congress!
NO ONE NOTICED THIS MONEY LEAVING THE COUNTRY!!!!!!!
@FreeBeacon  This admin is a complete sell out.
@FreeBeacon That act of Obuma administration is a curse that WILL bring nuclear destruction from Iran to America.
So now you are the expert at political Betrayal?
you all are fired!!!
@benshapiro more Obama BS
stonewalling in a justice! Pot meet the kettle.
The money came from somewhere. Look to Congress to do its job
@FreeBeacon and Congress does.....
the failure of the GOP to hold Obama accountable for his dealings with Iran will prove to be a huge moral failure.
LYING TED TRYING TO BE RELEVANT . NOT HAPPENING !!!!!!!! .
Did george bush or chaney ever told anybody how  the $ 200 billion was lost in iraq  that was tax payers money too?
|| Where's the power of the purse!? and why are YOU (congress) Allowing this to happen!?
Time to defund the Executive Branch. Setup Emergency funds for Critical Needs.
@FreeBeacon Very sick people.
Congress is full of cowards that talk, but do nothing. Everything is a political game at the cost to us, the citizens.
@benshapiro @USTreasury  I smell treason at the highest level. Ask A-Merica if they approve.  Ala Trump- "you're fired" #MAGA
@FreeBeacon Two more sick people Kerry and Obama.
@FreeBeacon Two other sick people Larry and Ibama
I thought the Corpseman bleated that we had "no banking relations w/Iran"
& why was State "structuring"? @USTreasury
And why hasn't Congress started to remove these politicians for treason????
What makes me so angry I could spit nails is EVERYBODY TALKS & NOBODY DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT
@FreeBeacon Should put that money to good use in Louisiana, why give it to our enemy? Washington is so corrupt!
WHEN IN HELL DOES ANY OF THESE SONS A BITCHES GO TO JAIL. HILLARY AND OBAMA SHOULD BE FIRST.
@JohnKerry Irresponsible use of taxpayers' money.
We transferred $1.3 billion to Iran, but we're not sure how or exactly who got it. Only under Obama!
remember, you work for we the People and those are mostly our hard earned tax dollars you bargained with.
So Senator, I respectfully ask what are you going to do about it. We look for action but never see any.
I just wish our constitution had some sort of checks & balances so that a Congress could offset any abuse of power
woo,woo,woo "unexplainable" how effin IRONIC coming from Ted. Your/others obsession w/Obama is why Trump is GOP king
When a citizen move $9999.00 +1 of his own money alarm bells ring, We the peasants!
so do something about it. And support the nominee of our party! It is not about u, but it is about the country.
@FreeBeacon  Do what?  
You morons need start paying attention to the message and stop hating the messenger
@FreeBeacon 
TREASONOUS PIGS ALL!
@FreeBeacon impeachment hearings are scheduled when?
why are you always against everything. We never hear a plan to accomplish anything. Get a jobs plan together.
Trump just outrageously raised the rent his campaign must pay. Another way to scam R donors. Just ignore that.
@benshapiro @USTreasury cash?
you guys have allowed it!  It's your own fault he acts this way towards us all.
your so right. Everytime I see one of these I ask impeachment hearings start when? Never get a time..
EXACTLY, because it's easier to Yap than it is to do something. They're all complicit at this point
@FreeBeacon but you want to put #Hillary in so more of this will go on . Shame on you.
at what point is it illegal and not just inexcusable...?
yet, if an innocent small business in America consistently deposits $9900 into their bank account, it will be seized by #IRS
How is aiding a country that wishes to kill us not treason?
?!?! Really?!?
