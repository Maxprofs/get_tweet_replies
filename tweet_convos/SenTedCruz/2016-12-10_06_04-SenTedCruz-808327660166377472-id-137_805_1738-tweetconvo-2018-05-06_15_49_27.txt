@tedcruz #TedCruz=best presidential candidate in 204 years. To claim he's done b/c he dared 2 oppose #ConManTrump=moronic!
Rick Santorum was never a constitutionalist like  #TedCruz!
.@jaredlaw @dcexaminer @tedcruz Rick IS a constitutionalist, not a 10th Amendment trumps Natural Law version like Ted.
#ROTFLMAO
.@jaredlaw @dcexaminer @tedcruz The Constitution does NOT give states power to redefine what is clearly evident in Natural Law. Period.
@tedcruz if Ted wants term limits he would go meet STATE legislatures in 38 states in support of Article V & #COSProject
do have to give Congress the chance to not act first... 8 or 9 states are ready... It's coming.
we do not have to give congress a chance to term limit themselves.  They will never consider.
.@ARC4Freedom @TomStark913 @dcexaminer @tedcruz We've had term limits since 1789:
2 yrs House
6 years Senate
good food for thought...and good point.
No, Those are not term limits! Those are length of each term! President we added term limit!
real problem is the heavy favor to incumbent. Solution; limits. Gotta keep open 2 solutions
So because you don't like your Rep/Sen or don't like someone else's I shouldn't be able to vote for mine?
@HumanParachute @gantonovna je vais commencer à croire que ses neurones commencent à se connecter..
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhm.... j'y crois pas trop perso
@peddoc63 Badly needed. It will be interesting to see the opposition and their reasoning.
@RoyalTXGirl @p_atira Freakin Absolutely !Get them out .NOW !
@saksivas_ GOOD! Thank GOD! Let's get the ball rolling
@tedcruz It's going to take Article V to get this done.  Corrupt politicians will not fire themselves.
@USTermLimits @dcexaminer @tedcruz I think that's what they're hoping for
@tedcruz Term limits, best thing that can happen for America. Lobbyists, limits too from the outgoing!
@USTermLimits @dcexaminer @tedcruz I'm all 4 it, however, we already have term limits. It's called not voting 4 the incumbent
@peddoc63 let's see who obstructs this first... Then it's ramed in with article V in a few years.
@peddoc63 I will be looking for McConnell to shelf this... No faith in GOP Senate leadership.
Ted Cruz not a traditionalist after all...
It will never fly Ted, a Convention of States is the only way I see.
Good on you Senator, I believe this is a great idea.  Thank you.
thank you!
@SenTedCruz Double edged sword.
@SenTedCruz Excellent! Should be limits. No more lifers in the house & senate. It's meant to be service, not a lucrative career.
@destinysimon its about time term limits & no pensions for govt service maybe then we will have people who only care about USA
@SenTedCruz I may not agree with Ted Cruz on many topics, but this is definitely something I can happily support
@tedcruz simple hyperbole
@SenTedCruz we'll get to find out who's in it for the $ and who's in it to serve. Good Luck!!
@SenTedCruz that's great.  We totally support you Senator!
@SenTedCruz that would fix everything. Congress would actually get work done. To bad McConnell will stop it dead in the tracks.
@SenTedCruz Thankyou!!!!
@tedcruz @veroderugy Fine in principle, but won't this further empower the entrenched federal "civil service" bureaucracy?
He wants to prevent others from getting the retirement he intends to take to Canada with him. Poor Lying Ted...
you do drugs?
@SenTedCruz amen, about time!
@SenTedCruz I would rather see Constitutional carry passed! Then we can talk about who deserves keeping their job/retirement.
Let's go all the way Ted. A Convention of the States is needed.
@SenTedCruz bravo senator.   Long overdue. New blood = new ideas
@bakerlarry84 3 terms is too short given the power of @potus http://ln.is/www.opnlttr.com/lett/V0cij …
NOW WE GOING TO REALLY SEE WHO THE RINOS ARE
@tedcruz  Ted are you still in politics?  Why dont you get out and do something useful for America!
voters should establish term limits with their votes...not a government bill
Never thought I'd see a day where I could agree with @tedcruz on something.
About bloody time.
@tedcruz WTG Ted. Thanks
@tedcruz i agree we should have trm limits
And it will go nowhere. Convention of States is the only way it's going to happen. These power hungry crooks are not going to.
@tedcruz @RonDeSantisFL @realDonaldTrump   term limits only way to #draintheswamp in DC !
@tedcruz How about Ted Cruz speaking out about Russian Hacking. Join @LindseyGrahamSC & #SenJohnMcCain call for Investigation!
Ted, I would like to see you head the FBI and straighten it out!
@BayShoreIsHome God I hope this is true and I hope it happens!!
@tedcruz Thank you, Senator Cruz. Please do not confirm Tillerson for Secretary of State
@tedcruz Go Teddy!
serve two, sit out one then eligible to run for two more - Ohio Governor model. Jim Rhoades got beat 4th term. 12 of 16
@tedcruz Hope term limits become a reality.
How about national voter ID laws. Keep illegals away from the voting booths.
perhaps a mandate for the States to inact. I agree but not via nationalizing elections. Wording bit ambitious.
Just voter ID laws. Must be a citizen to vote, so prove it. I was asked to, why not every voter.
fact this doesn't happen defies all logic. I couldn't get into a bar on my wedding day cuz I forgot wallet
@tedcruz This is a conversation worth having.
Good work Cruz!
PLEASE INTRODUCE A BILL TO GET RID OF HILLARY AND THE ABORTIONIST!
@texasfreedom101 
INTRODUCE A BILL TO GET RID OF HILLARY. 
#PLEASE
@tedcruz Never thought I'd agree with Ted Cruz.
are you really a Marxist Leninist?
Indeed.
@tedcruz very honorable man. Glad that he is supporting Trump now.
@laurie6805 much needed long overdue!
spawn of Satan Ted Cruz is a fake who will exempt himself from any of these worthless plans
@tedcruz CUT pensions, high salary &benefits and term limits are not needed,as only those that want to serve will be there!
@tedcruz Term limits!! Awesome.
@tedcruz Excellent!
@tedcruz ARTICLE 5! Push a convention of states ( while we still have them )
I cannot say how great this is. No words can express it. Thank you @tedcruz
We have term limits... #primaries.
Also, vote for #ConstitutionParty candidates.
Stop supporting #CorruptDuopoly.
@dcexaminer @tedcruz
Nice symbolism.  Good luck @TedCruz
@tedcruz End Congressional pension. Lifetime ban on lobbying. Get better result. Don't need Amendment.
Ted Cruz to introduce constitutional amendment for congressional term limits http://washex.am/2hf2314  
HR 973 - repeal WEP & GPO ASAP! 
not fair that Americans who earned benefits can't receive them while immigrants get US $
@tedcruz we need an anti-lobbying section in that amendment!! @COSProject
any bets on Congress's reaction?
AGREE 100%! WE NEED TERM LIMITS FOR CONGRESS!
AMERICANS OUT OF WORK, UNDER-EMPLOYED, WHILE CONGRESS MILKS THE SYSTEM IN LIFETIME JOBS, POSH PENSIONS! TOTAL BS!
AGREE 100%! TERM LIMITS ARE LONG OVER-DUE! LIFETIME POLITICIANS ON THE TAXPAYERS DIME, IS TOTAL BS! TAXPAYERS R FED UP
@tedcruz How about a constitution amndmnt to repeal the 16 Amendment at the same time! Stop the income tax & stop class warfare.
its single most effective thing to reign in campaign finance impropriety & create more representative government
Thank you Senator Cruz
@tedcruz Term limits are a must!  Disappointed Trump has stopped including this step in his DrainTheSwamp talk at ty rallies.
@SenTedCruz Need to require career bureaucrats to move around, not fossilize for 30 yrs in one agency!
@tedcruz thank you @SenTedCruz
@tedcruz term limits are the only sure way to an efficient and honest government
@tedcruz thank you. Badly needed
How about a constitutional amendment for Healthcare Vouchers for Veterans TrusTed to Lie @tedcruz ???
go Ted! I completely support #TermLimits
@tedcruz This, if it ever came to be, would do wonders for the country.
@tedcruz You would think everyone would agree on this!  This should be a non-partisan issue!
@tedcruz   This great but what can we do about the embedded beuocrates
@tedcruz I'd say 2 terms is sufficient. If good for prez then should be plenty for all.
Oh, Green Eggs & Ham!
@tedcruz I seriously cannot imagine any American, other than lobbyists & politicians, opposing term limits!
@tedcruz Repeal the damn 17th amendment. That will take a crapload of dirty money out and give back power to the states.
More populist pandering from the country's second biggest liar.
My hope is that the people will insist that our elected officials move to this constitutional amendment. #TermLimits
I sure hope it goes through!
@tedcruz Balance budget amendment with a 3% GDP cap including a no pay not deferred section for noncompliance excluding Military
@tedcruz good luck with this one.
#DrainTheSwamp!
@tedcruz I believe Cruz will be extremely effective in promoting his and Trumps objectives as regards constitution.
@tedcruz This is bullshit. Congressmen will never vote against there own interests. This is Washington, not some non profit.
@tedcruz Good job! Now get it passed!
@tedcruz Much needed and long overdue.  Fingers crossed.
Old Lyin' Ted should just turn in his dad for helping to kill JFK like President Trump told us. #NoLieTrump
that is disgusting for a liberal even.
Life long Republican who knows President Trump doesn't lie. He told us about,
@tedcruz Let's hope it becomes a reality soon.
do something about their pensions also, work 5 years and get 100% of their salary for life, term limits, more pensions
@tedcruz Great! More congresspeople turned into lobbyists! This is an incredibly stupid idea, so of course Ted supports it.
@tedcruz We also would need to do away with the lifetime paycheck for Congress. Term limits = more Congress turnover = $$
@tedcruz Go Ted go!!!
@tedcruz  Pray he gets the support.  Civil Service was NEVER meant to be a money making career.  Hence "SERVICE "
@tedcruz YES, finally
@tedcruz smart.
@tedcruz Praise God!
Thank you Ted,  you were my choice.
@tedcruz OUTSTANDING! About time we elect people to office who want to SERVE and not SELF-SERVE!
Sen. Cruz get Mr. President Elect to abolish the IRS & unconstitutional Federal Reserve! That would eliminate future debt 100%!
@tedcruz Best news in a long time
Why not live the courage of his convictions, and resign? We know the game.
well, he is only in his first term still until 2018. But facts aren't your strong suit
Still, he should take his own advice, and limit his term to "already served".
@tedcruz fake news
@tedcruz anti-lobbying clause for termed out members would truly #draintheswamp
@tedcruz it is one of the 100 day promises of PEOTUS
This is a PR stunt.. Congress must limit their terms, fat chance.  Cruz is just trying to act relevant. He's done, over, Kaput.
Will never happen.The people were trying to limit are the same ones that vote on it. Fat chance.
Lyin TED?
Better late than Never, Of course the law will only apply to NEW Elected after the takes effect (if) it passes.
this sociopath will try anything to get in the White House.
