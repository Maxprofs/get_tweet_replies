US gives U.N $8Billion Dollars p/year and gives Israel almost $4Billion p/year. Defunding UN will make US weak @CUFI
Lindsey Graham & Ted Cruz unite to defund #UN over anti-#Israel bias
 http://washex.am/2jnakB7 
Not only that but the UN has only the power that America gives it.  It's time to close it down. We support Israel or suffer God's wrath.
You are crazy, tell Israel to live up to treaties.
@sentedcruz you really might want to wait until I get the$975 trillion owed me for the widows and orphans and my wages of$42,018.00/yr
and the 975 trillion is about to jump 23% in just under 30 days. And then I'll be the very first quadrillion air
#strangebedfellows but, OK, I like it!
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer If U2 KNOW The US would be the LOSER. The SC gives more power to the FIVE Permanent Members. No UN=0 Power
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer May I Remington you that Israel is not the US and the res doesn't stop anything...Like $38 billion in aid?
This is the Dem point of view. http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/14818 â€¦
Support Israel to take over the entire region. Even the Palestinians who work for the Israelis what this because they are treated so well.
@ChuckNellis It is about damn time!
great news!
Can the UN reverse their decision I imagine if they don't have any money or much money they couldn't enforce it right?  No money for the UN
Amen. if  we loose Israel, They are the "apple of God's eye" We were grafted in. we are  made one by Christ.

@KatyinIndy @dcexaminer great.  Graham does have brain.  Sometimes.
I wouldn't promise funding to that worthless organization.
Amen brother. NO one can tell Israel to split. It's about their oil Ted. You can not ask them to negotiate with terrorists who lie.
@KatyinIndy @dcexaminer The TWO GLOBALISTS and your hate for Trump can't let you see that.
DEFUND SANCTUARY CITIES N SYRIAN REFUGEES PROJECT BUILD THE WALL DEPORT ISLAM PERIOD START OVER AGAIN IMBECILES

@KVUE
@KVUE Senator, you do realize that Israel has one of the most liberal abortion policies in the world, right?
secrets, citing alleged fears that Russia held blackmail information over Trump, according to a report today
U.S. intelligence officials warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust President-elect Donald Trump with intelligence
Just one of many reasons to pull our funding from that cesspool.
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer Brotherhood is a terrorist who founded isis must issuance of Congress's decision
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer thank you senator Cruz cannot happen fast enough
@tedcruz @dcexaminer And yet you support a presidential candidate that hired people from an anti-Semitic fake news site like Breitbart
Why isn't Israel supporting a two state plan? Why are they refusing to accept Palestine as a state?
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer @POTUS @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems THEY FUND MASS MURDERING CO-WORKERS.THIS ISNT THE BIBLICAL NOR TORAH ISRAEL
THIS IS OUR MIDDLE EAST DEFENSE SYSTEM, THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT ISRAELI NAZI
ILLEGAL ISRAELI GOV. CAN MASS MURDER UNARMED INNOCENT TRAPPED CIVILIANS....
IN THE COMMISION OF WAR CRIMES/GENOCIDE TO STEAL LAND! YOUR ON WRONG SIDE
OF GOD AGAIN! NOT IN THE NAME OF AMERICA GREEDY GOP NAZIS!
Thank you
glad Lindsay Graham did one thing right. Normally is more a liberal than anything.
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer great idea...should of been done b4 that ass in the WH did so much damage to us.
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer now that I can agree with. Still think Graham is a dick head
@tedcruz
I'll be praying for you.
@tedcruz @dcexaminer  Lindsey is saying Israel democracy  yes if you white !
Stunning, you're a good man Ted. Is Graham changing his tune?
@tedcruz @dcexaminer well thats the only thing in recent they're doing as right by gop
Long before running a massive Ponzi Scheme, William Croke went with my '95 HHS AP Econ. class to dispel Israeli settlements!?
Amazing that #BetrayerGraham would stand up 4 anything worthwhile IT'S ABOUT TIME!
@tedcruz @dcexaminer woohoo @UN is exactly that UN!!   as in unAmerican,untrustworthy, undone, unhelpful, unfunnded by all hopefully
@tedcruz @dcexaminer 
Phony two faced c sers do nothing but collect a paycheck
Throw wrenches
Break protocol
Made us a laughingstock
@tedcruz @dcexaminer  Sad that they have got to do something that should have been done years ago. Thank GOD 4 Cruz & Graham
Why don't you do something useful, like condemning Trump's upcoming occupation of the White House?
Well well didn't see Lindsey Graham going against his boss Nazi Soros and backing Israel.
@tedcruz @dcexaminer YaHaHah! Figured they'd SWITCH THGS UP! So now it's Marco & McCain against THE WORLD? Please somebody wake up NOW
fascists helping fascists.  WHat's not to love?
Great. At least Lindsey does one or two things right.
a broken clock is right twice a day, right?
@tedcruz we're going to look back that these defining moments and say "what the Hell were they thinking"!
@tedcruz @dcexaminer wow! How sad! What is this world coming to?
Hallelujah!
