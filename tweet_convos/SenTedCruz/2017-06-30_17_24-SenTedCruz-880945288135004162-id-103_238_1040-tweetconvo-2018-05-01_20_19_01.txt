Distraction from McConnell & Cruz 3rd Trumpcare attemp coming this week. Medicare 4 all only way2 stop civil war. Stop playing w/ppls lives!
Dear Ted, can you please send me a list of those in your party, including yourself, seeking re-election in 2018?
I’m seeking to switch parties and want to make sure that each & every single one of you get more years in office. Cant keep straight face 
Why I do not trust @SenTedCruz ??? Ohhh I remember now, he behaved badly and rude against our @POTUS ... and he is playing games ...
Well considering he lost his spine in the process, his new goal is to suck DTs @@@@
And then Pence's in the near future.
what is happening?
I do not want my voter info going to @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @POTUS   My info is none of their business! #TrumpsMentalState
Here on earth there is a madman in the WH. 
When will you take a stand and stop worrying 
about re-election?
#25thAmendmentNOW
What is exactly the amendment you are talking about
WHAT ABOUT REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE? ANYONE WORRIED ABOUT THAT? YOU REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET ON YOUR JOB AND DO WHAT WE PUT YOU
IN OFFICE FOR, WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON HEALTHCARE AND TAX REFORM, OR BE REPLACED
Hey Ted, here's some of that peer reviewed #Science you talked about: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jul/03/bad-news-for-climate-contrarians-the-best-data-we-have-just-got-hotter?CMP=share_btn_tw …  Tell @EPAScottPruitt #climatechange
A guy with plenty of space between ears VP,is curious about outer space?
@NASA @POTUS Please tell me you're going there and staying.
Pence & Spawn of Satan Cruz would better serve America if they were shot into space. They both serve Satan & are fake Christians
Please please tell me Ted Cruz isn't part of any leaderships, especially anything to do with space or technology or knowledge.
and we look forward to sending you to space, in 2018.
Please send @realDonaldTrump up there.  His planet Doom is waiting for his return.
Sen. Cruz CBO projects maj cuts 2 MEDICAID. GOP guts Medicaid helps veterans, kids, disable & elderly.

Love Reading All The Leftist Trolls Striving For Recognition, Let's unite And Save The Republic !!
How about you work on things that REALLY matter like education & healthcare?

Another fine choice by 45? No.Workforce initiative? Ivanka knows ALL about working for a living. Is @vp a space cadet so he's all up on NASA
Money for space & tax cuts for the rich.  The sick & poor you could care less.  Selfish!
When are you going to be interested in listening to your constituents?
How about for a change you worry about us here on planet earth?
Saving humanity via Space Settlement is a NASA Pipedream! Cannot & will not be done! Use $$ to save this planet from further degradation!
Suggest reestablish @POTUS35 #JFK Council on Physical Fitness, Youth Physical Fitness. Timely when 1/3 #EverydayAmericans clinically obese
Yes!!!
Awesome, I'm sure they'll do a great job because doing something is way better than nothing as in the obama era
Really! Do something that matters like heakthcare or tax reform stop being K ike the Ds remember u represent t he oeoplenot ur own intrests
Time to get to Mars !!
What?  A space agency focused on space exploration and not Muslim outreach!  What and outrage!
So happy about this!  We expect to get rides from Russia?! Laughable!  We NEED the space program.
Awesome
Seems like NASA and space exploration is a waste of money right now.  We are 20 trillion in debt.  Gut all of it.
I'm surprised you didn't blame Obama for that too.
Privatize @NASA.
So excited to see this all happening. The National Space Council is a great thing to bring back!!
ABOUT PASSING HEALTHCARE,,,,,NOW,,
A man that doesn't accept science leading a scientific endeavor?  Guess it would be in line with Trump's other appointments.
Why aren't you speaking to the Trump-Natl Enquirer connection after what he did to you?????
He's using it again and you say nothing?
We need you to stand up against this admin requesting voter info!!! Wake up man!
Will a cross or a bible be put in orbit so that @VP & other religious freaks can search for evidence of second coming approaching earth?
Re-establish NASA prestige & eliminate the Barry era women's council. Two great steps!
Didn't you sponsor a bill that "encouraged" NASA to outsource their work to private, possibly foreign, contractors?

Yeah. You did. #MAGA
Yeah! The GOP are leaving with Nitwit Gingrich for his Moon Station! Be sure to take Trumpster with you!
With no scientists anywhere around? #trumpfail
Excellent,hope politicians will learn from Potus how much can be done through hard work and dedication! Most of you'all are falling flat 
Yo @SenTedCruz! How is adding government bureaucracy and increasing the power of the Federal Gov a good thing?! Stop messing with @NASA
If you can't get Kate's passed. Don't come home.
Great a science denying clown.  @BetoORourke would make a better senator
Wait....@SenTedCruz believes in space?
Maybe you could be the first Texan senator to go into the great frontier.
Will you two be on first rocket to Mars? Texas deserves better than Cruz. Beto for US senate.
Thank God we're at least researching places to go after we fuck up this planet
first mission: find Noah's ark!  it's out there somewhere...
Excellent news for whom? Two people whose only accomplishments are obstructionist in nature, who don't believe in science leading the NSC.
Good for Virginia as well!
Go up. Don't come back.
@NASA Trump's shiny EO creates a National Space Council, but he defunds many programs that make space science possible. Good 4 Ted, bad 4 us
Get the health care bill done before my rates go up again. Enough is enough
Maybe you can rescue that child slave ring on Mars that Alex Jones had discovered. Better get going!
Where is space exploration in the Constitution?
Start by shooting him and yourself into space.
Cut Medicaid but waste money in space. Your values are completely fucked up!
America is broke!
Where is the push back on our lying @POTUS ? He never even apologized for your wife or father, but you still kiss the ring. R&R Lyin Ted!
This administration can't even lead on Earth.
Traitor says what?
Deplorable, hypocrite Cruz! Dumbo trumpo said Your father was involved in JFK's murder. Is that true?
I will happily pay the taxes that fund sending you two into orbit. #toagalaxyfaraway
When will you and the other elected officials work for America?
Give us healthcare! #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Can we send all you knuckleheads to Mars? #GOPonMars
you are aligned with a corrupt administration and will be held accountable
#Cruz for SCOTUS
Can @NASA send Lyin Ted into orbit?
If the #GOP has their way Space will be more habitable than earth.
