Thank you.
God Bless you Governor Abbott and God Bless our military heroes!
@GregAbbott_TX Recognize @TravisCoSheriff no to stripping funds that help Texans! Be a true leader, find another, positive way
Veterans: would you rather have a cheap scroll with Abbott's signature on it, or healthcare he's cutting?
u shud b locked away 4 illegally detain immigrants 4 nothing
You just cut funding for vets in Travis County. Pls find another way to spar w @TravisCoSheriff if you must.
hope out state care is rated A+
great! Are we also going to honor them by making sure they never ever end up on the  streets?!
when are you going to give Carlos Coy a retrial? #FreeSPM
:) how about using them for a civilian militia since the judge banned the national agenda  train in high school limited authority
Honor to all veterans?until they get disability or S.S.,they are trying to pass law taking away their gun rights !!!
Proud of you standing up against Sanctuary Cities!! Keep it going.

You don't care about anyone but yourself, the rich, bigots that want to, give us low paying jobs, and polluted air! #indivisible

@squash_13  So grateful for your service, @squash_13 !!
@SenTedCruz 
@SenTedCruz live in NM but proud to be a TX vet -- sent our kids there to hold our place 
@SenTedCruz god bless our military!
@Phibear94 10 yrs ago today we lost 2 great Cavalrymen from FT Hood, in Iraq.  RIP Keith and Jason.
I wonder how many you'd turn your back on because they were gay. Or women. These heroes deserve better than you.
@SenTedCruz thanks for your service, Heroes!
I wish Gov. Abbott was the Governor of California!  We need a man like him!
me too
Like my Texas grandfather who died in WWII https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=3394893 â€¦
@BourneInTexas TENN SAYS....THANK YOU AND "GOD BLESS TEXAS"...
Unless, of course, they are gay, where you want to take their spousal benefits away. Nice.
Thank you!
This regime is not what I fought for. #veteran #feminist #lgbtq 
Veterans: Abbot's bill cuts critical funding for your care.
Veterans, remember this: politicians will get our soldiers killed, using racial hatred to stay in power
Veterans, take note: Abbott doesn't give a shit that we NEED friends in the region who speak Arabic.
But you will let military personnel DIE in Iraq. The #MuslimBan you support leaves our soldiers exposed.
Now that is outstanding, GovAbbott !  More states should surely do that.
