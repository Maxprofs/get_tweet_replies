better read through it to make sure it's what they say it is not just a vehicle for useless pork projects
THUMBS UP, THIS SHOULD BRING OUT THE RINOS.
@cvpayne We have term limits.  The voters get a chance limit the term of candidates they don't like.
Please, yes!!!!! Term limits!!!!!!
@tedcruz Term limits?  When imposed, bureaucrats end up running the show.  Voters should determine length of service.
first bit of sense ive seen.  Limit terms w/elections. Have inexp legislators and lifer ppl lobbyists
@tedcruz They should be shorter!!!!!
nice photo
Beyond time for that. Overtime they all become whores. No disrespect meant to whores !!!

@tedcruz does this mean you'll leave willingly? You will have made enough connections to keep you rich. Please go. Take Ryan, too.
OK If Cruz succeeds in getting an amendment to institute term limits in both houses of Congress, we will forgive him.
that's a big if
