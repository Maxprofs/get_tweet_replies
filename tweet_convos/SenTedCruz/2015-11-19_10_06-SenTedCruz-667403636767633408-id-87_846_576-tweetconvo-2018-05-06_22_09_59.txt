@SenTedCruz @FBI Remind me again...how many of the #Paris terrorists were *actual* Syrian refugees? #NonLegislatingFromUnderTheBed
@MuthrBear @SenTedCruz @FBI At least two, maybe three.
@SandyLannis I did read something in the Telegraph about 2 poss migrants, but migrants are not the same as refugees. @SenTedCruz @FBI
@MuthrBear @SenTedCruz @FBI Plus the 2 Boston marathon terrorists were refugees. It's a natural way for Islamic terrorists to infiltrate pop
@SandyLannis In campaign season, the sound-bytes seem 2b just 2 good 4 some 2 pass up, but political expedience ≠ rational thotful analysis.
@SenTedCruz @FBI none of the Paris attackers were refugees. Where is your basis for this?
.@poorginsberg @SenTedCruz @FBI Go look at the latest in Sweden, Germany, Belgium ...MAYBE you'll get a clue (probably not)
@adelawagner1 @poorginsberg @SenTedCruz @FBI paris attackers gloated about the ease they moved between france & paris pretending 2b refugees
@SenTedCruz @FBI Ads must be run next 10 days non-stop so ppl realize how important it is Senate to halt refugees not sufficiently vetted.
@SenTedCruz @FBI Such a Courageous Christian man, keeping those little 5 year old terrorists from infiltrating Jesus's country.
@liloneami @SenTedCruz @FBI Those 5 year-olds who become indoctrinated in Death to America & greatness of Islamic jihad will be a threat;
@SenTedCruz @RachelToler2 @FBI FBI  Assi't Director-Scary Let MIGRANTS In-No Idea Who They R -YET FBI PROTECTS THEM?

@SweepsFox @SenTedCruz @FBI war is coming and from many fronts
@RachelToler2 @SenTedCruz @FBI We the PPL need 2 Sweep many things CLEAN-get back our Constitution/American Values-not White Genocide
@SweepsFox @SenTedCruz @FBI millions of Americans know what they are doing and are ready to fight to get those things back
@SenTedCruz @FBI # keep it on, Ted, we r with u.
We r in the majority, not like the left wants, the non-informed to believe.
.@SenTedCruz @FBI They also can't vet senators to find out whether or not they're religious zealots who hate women apparently.
@chadkultgen @SenTedCruz @FBI It's the Islamists defended by Obama & Hillary who hate women; Ted making sure sharia law never passes here
@SenTedCruz @FBI Ted Cruz ought to be exiled.
@SenTedCruz @FBI 
Our Next President 
@realDonaldTrump 
 I changed my support to Trump when Cruz sold out the 1A
@SenTedCruz @DanMartin_cards @FBI Obama wants terrorists here.  Part of his plan to dismantle America.
@SenTedCruz @Warrior417 @FBI Of course they can't and its just an excuse.  They won't.  The cost alone is off the map.
@SenTedCruz @FBI This is why we Must Raise Hell with our elected officals. AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO TALK TO MCCAIN NO REFUGEES
@AHumanCrisis @SenTedCruz @FBI this is why we must raise hell with our elected officials. Someone needs to talk to John McCain no refugees

@SenTedCruz @tomferrari @FBI My question is Who are you talking to that actually gives a flying rats ass what you are saying? Congress? Ha!
Since deliberations r almost entirely done behind closed doors, floor "debate" is for raising public awareness

@eastrong50 @SenTedCruz @FBI
@SenTedCruz @Sweetpea593 @FBI The administration can't even find Obama's college transcripts...how are they going to vet 500K refugees.
@jeanniology @SenTedCruz @Sweetpea593 @FBI Obama doesn't want his transcripts found. We'd see how much of a "scholar" he was.
@Truthseer1961 @SenTedCruz @Sweetpea593 @FBI Or that he's a foreign student and his presidency is a Constitutional violation.
@jeanniology #Bazinga @SenTedCruz @Sweetpea593 @FBI
@SenTedCruz last year, you said we could. What's the difference now?
@SenTedCruz @GaetaSusan @FBI Senator Cruz. NEVER stop until your in the White House and can bring this country back
That's why Barry won't care about this bill he can still get his homeys into America it won't stop a damn thing  @SenTedCruz @FBI
@SenTedCruz @FBI What Americans consider "radical" Islam is NOT what Middle Easterners consider "radical" Islam. 75 % support Sharia.
Wait can't you query the cave drawing data bases?  @SenTedCruz @FBI
@SenTedCruz @MStuart1970 @FBI Do the job we sent you to DC to do. Bringing in the enemy constitutes #TREASON!
@SenTedCruz @MStuart1970 @FBI @BarackObama the fool doesn't care bout national security. He wants 2 build a grateful dependent constituency.
@SenTedCruz @FBI STAY ON TOP OF THIS TED CRUZ.  OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED
.@sentedcruz @fbi @psalm11813  #Somebody please tell Paul Ryan!

@SenTedCruz @FBI @cgpb u r talks bout the same refugees that were created when POTUS stirred his back & 4got the red line? Those?
@SenTedCruz @AZPatriot01 @FBI if they can't be vetted properly then no way should they be allowed to step foot on our soil!
@SenTedCruz @bevrobertson3 @FBI @SenWarren @SenSchumer Why did America stand by and watch slaughter  of children Have you no moral compass
@SenTedCruz @bevrobertson3 @FBI  Ted: TKS for standing up for Christians you should also stand up for Kurds.  Look at numbers

@SenTedCruz @FBI Thank you to Ted Cruz 4 not only representing his TX constituency in House, but American values across nation. #ProtectUSA
@SenTedCruz @FBI We can't know everything.  The TSA can't find all the weapons that end up on airplanes but we don't shut down the airports.
@SenTedCruz @FBI and all that falls on deaf democrat ears. They want any illegal to prop up # of citizens for more electoral votes. Big Scam
@SenTedCruz @FBI
@SenTedCruz @FBI no shit!
@SenTedCruz @FBI Someone needs to call out this President as a traitor & detrimental to the health of the US based on all his actions.
@SenTedCruz http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/11/19/how-the-gop-is-letting-their-hatred-of-president-obama-hinder-the-fight-against-isis/ …
@SudokuG Sofa King weak.
@SenTedCruz @FBI ISIS is also in Iraq&Libya, we take refugees from there. Why the myopic focus on Syria? Stop ALL Muslim immigration.
