we support you guys, but take the innocent man's picture down and put up the actual suspect.
his innocence was circulated a zillion times. Smart he willingly turned himself in/released.  @DallasPD
true. I feel bad for him though.
I want Dallas to March for the officers! What a gift to America to show that community is so good!
I believe one is being organized 
Awwww! Incredible! Thanks for telling me
@MiMi_Kasovich  when @POTUS comes tomorrow you should show how much you appreciate his support ...non support...what?
Non support
