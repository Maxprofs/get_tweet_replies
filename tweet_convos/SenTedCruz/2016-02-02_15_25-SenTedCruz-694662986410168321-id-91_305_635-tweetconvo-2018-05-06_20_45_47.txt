@SenTedCruz @POTUS You've been called out on this lie more than once. Why continue telling it? Oh yeah, the idiots who want to believe it.
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted shut down the Government. He will never be Prez.
@frelling_cute @SudokuG @SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama shut down the government by refusing to sign responsible spending bills.
@cindysharmony @frelling_cute @SenTedCruz @POTUS FFS, responsible spending bills...pffft!
@SudokuG @frelling_cute ) So you think it's responsible for our President to accumulate 19tril in debt for your kids to pay off?
@cindysharmony @frelling_cute So you think it's OK for Republicans to act as if they had nothing to do with that? Pfft!!!
@SudokuG @frelling_cute They should have double checked it 1st but I don't think the oversight was malicious.  Don't let anger fuel anarchy.
@cindysharmony @frelling_cute Mere oversight??? You need to educate yourself on the topic before spouting off.
@SenTedCruz  Since you seem to have memory loss of being called out on these lies...
@survivingmyteen You know this how????
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You are lying again. U want to take Insurance away from Millions. #fakechristian
@frelling_cute @SenTedCruz @POTUS  No, insurance would be better because the government wouldn't be mandating you get unnecessary coverage.
@cindysharmony Just out of interest, Cindy - do you call yourself a Christian? If yes, think about things ;-) @frelling_cute @SenTedCruz
