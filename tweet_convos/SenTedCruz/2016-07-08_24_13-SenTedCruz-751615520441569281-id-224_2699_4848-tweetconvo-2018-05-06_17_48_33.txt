@militia_usa P.S. Hope your wounds are healing soon. God bless.
Nice try.  You usually embarrass this state at least daily.  "Open carry" are begging to be shot by the police.
Or named a suspect and shot by Everyone! Kinda undoes the NRA's "Good guy with a gun" bullshit!
@BlogLiberally @rockyjimbeam @GovAbbott
Your right we do know.
@TraceyTheisen mean while white is Obama
how about doing something to address gun violence in your state?
@SenTedCruz I salute our governor Cruz not so much #4thAmendment
YOU SIR ARE THE PRIDE OF TEXAS, GREG, AMEN, #STANDWITHBLUE #PRAYFORDALLAS
Thank you for honoring our law enforcement.  #BlueLivesMatter #Texas #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #AmericaFirst

@GovAbbott @Callisto1947
Lincoln Memorial in Blue WOW. Good for Bing Check out today's homepage on Bing
I dare the white house to do the same. I guess it is just not as important as Prince dying!
Tonight the #Texas Governor’s Mansion will be lit blue to honor our law enforcement #DallasPoliceShooting 
how about the white(black) house? Lit it blue!
Thank you.
speedy recovery to #lawenforcement officer injured inline of duty.
Protect and serve.
why cant it be lit black for us african americans????????????
@SenTedCruz Was blue one of the rainbow colors on the White House?
@SenTedCruz Yes! Blue for Facebook, where the gunman purchased his AK47 because, well, he can.
@SenTedCruz Was it lit in rainbow after 49 LGBT were gunned down? I don't remember...
hope you are feeling better governor!!
@eholmby We need a glimmer. Of hope We salute our fallen peace officers we demand Justice USA
Thank you, our current president has no honor left.
And the White House will close it's curtains,
B A R  BLM from Texas sir.
jow come u never lit the mansion up in support of #Blacklivesmatter ?   If u you showd support maybe wouldn't keep this happenin.
Thank you
Hmmm...is the White House doing that?
Sir thank you for your integrity and valiance. God's blessings and protection to you. Keep leading America. @LindaSuhler
Too bad our White House has not been turned blue. But that probably would not fit their narrative. #DallasPoliceShooting
God bless!   Just so you know, better lite in pink, rainbow, whatever in next few days! Don't want to leave anyone out!
@SenTedCruz   Thank you. Today, all Americans should be BLUE.
Hollow gesture. How about banning assault weapons
@Miss_Karizma89 And will the WH be lit up as a rainbow with an ISIS flag flying?
I Can honestly see that!!! He always shows sympathy for them
sorry for the loss of your staff. Sorry for all lives lost. We can all do much better.
@SenTedCruz if Obama lit the WH in rainbow to support LGBT why not follow Texas example and light it in blue? Just saying
A Black Racist killed our white policemen.  I am Angry.  We do NOT need this race baiting POTUS in our State.
still waiting on White House lights
I'm proud of them sir as i know many more are.
@KandiRider that's called leadership
But will Obama...he did it when homosexuals got right to marry
-Thank you, Sir. Don't recall the WH displaying the color of blue up on the WH? Maybe I missed it.
I support the cops,like the Whitehouse gay,this needs to http://stop.Gov 't is not suppose to recognize one over the other
It's just like an anti black Governor to recognize the Effect but not the Cause How bout dealing with why those deaths occurred?
the White House will be in in black, honoring the Islamic State and Black Lives Matter, courtesy of B. Hussein O'bama.
Thank You Governor! This is the honorable thing to do #prayfordallas # all lives matter
.. Gov you are a class act ... now let's see if the White House lights up blue ! #WhiteHouse #DallasPoliceShootings
well done
@SenTedCruz Are you going to ever do this for black people, women or LGBT people when they are killed by violence?
Thanks Governor. Love and prayers for our police officers and their families.
Thank you Governor for honoring our brothers and sisters.
@SenTedCruz I am proud to be a Texan!  #ComingTogetherMatters
#standwithmicha
God bless our fallen Heroes. And pls God take away the powers of those who wud divide us & allow us to recognize our enemy
Thank you Gov Abbott...I was deeply touched by your statement
WE must support LE....the left sees fit to wash all with same brush
I didn't think it was the MN gov's. mansion.
@NBCDFW now that you got that out the way, how about changing it to RED for all the innocent lives lost ? Figure you couldn't....
Gov. Abbott, Thank you for being a strong leader for my Texas.
@peddoc63 THANK YOU GOV. Abbott. True Patriot. Recommend WH do the same. Need sign of Unity for Our Nation.
thank you for supporting Texas..
God Bless, Brent Thompson DART killed by sniper in Dallas, my friends wife's cousin,myfriendSam30yrsDPD SouthsidenowRET
@WyattEarp2 ~ BO will light up the WH for his LGBT community; But zero lights for our LEOs!! #ArrestObamaForTREASON #MAGA
He is so in your face - his complete distain for this country 
@donsurber @BarbaraHawk4 That is Awesome!!!
funnyWeSee D WH lit in rainbow colors but not lit in blue4the brave fallen heros of law enforcement,says a lot abt him doesn't it
@louiselloyd3 What color was the White House? Surely POTUS honored these officers sacrifice.
Did you black out the mansion yesterday, to honor the victims of police wrongdoings, Sterling & Castile? 8-/ @bigatlantasteve
Castile had robbed a USA the night before. Not a taillight stop. Sterling armed and resisting arrest.
Castile only remotely resembled the description. And Sterling was already under control by officers. @bigatlantasteve @govabbott
You are probably a troll. Why else this "blame the victim" crap? Blocked. @bigatlantasteve @govabbott

Can you have you AG file an arrest warrant for the people funding BLM. They are now tied to murdering Texans.
ahhh,thats pretty. #2A #Texas.Dystopian #Dallas
RIP TO THE OFFICERS WHO DIED AND A QUICK RECOVERY TO THE SURVIVING OFFICERS
@CamAndCompany it's beautiful
Blue for Democrats.
@EWErickson  Beautiful color.  Literally & figuratively.
what color did you do it for all blacks killed by the police?
@TexasGOP I had placed blue light bulbs around our house in honor of our fallen officers.
What if you honored all of humanity, everyday? Then what?
THANK YOU

@SJack246 Beautiful!
I wish I could "like" your post more than once!
@VAnnie71875849 @realDonaldTrump TRUE LEADERSHIP #MakeAllLifesGreatAgain #MakeAllLifesGreatAgain "WE LVU"
@SenTedCruz 

@POTUS needs to do this at the White House. #bluelivesmatter2 #bluelivesmatter #DallasPoliceShooting
@DavidHerjavec Hey Abbott! Then what are you going to light in black to honour the African Americans murdered by cops?
@SenTedCruz  take tx out of the Union. Please! Millions will move there
thank you both for your presence of mind in handling the rhetoric ensuing this tragedy. Your strengths are worthy.
.@GovAbbott @SenTedCruz I wonder if our nation's capital will also be lit in blue to show support for law enforcement? @WhiteHouse
@GovAbbott @JimDeMint
@SenTedCruz thank you. At least a few gov officials care enough to show those in blue we are grateful for all they do every day.

@SenTedCruz 

I Stand w/ #Dallas #Blue
That is sadly beautiful @GovAbbott @SenTedCruz.
@SenTedCruz Is there a mourning color scheme for when police kill someone? I genuinely want to know.
What about african-americans dying by the hands of these crooked cops? No lights for them huh, Governor?
Thank you both for your leadership.
@SenTedCruz Maybe I missed it but I sure hope the White House is lit blue too. They light up for everything else.
@SenTedCruz Thank-you Govenor.
prayers to you and your state!
@cscudder was it lit black when Texas woman #sandrabland was murdered?
I would say something about that but will follow Thumper's advice instead.
@davidfrum Is that the best you can do, you fuck?
@davidfrum very touching but ....since when do cops wear blue? Most wear khaki or brown or black these days. Isn't that true?
They lit up the White House for homosexuals, why not blue for the murdered police?
Bet Minnesota Gov. doesn't.
, as a non texan it's beautiful seeing a state's leader support police and first responders in good and bad times. #DallasStrong
@viola_tamez 
@ChrisLoesch Respect Gov Abbott a true leader.
@TruckerBobS Creepy cop worship.
Thank you so much for your proud display for the officers.  Bless you and your fine state. #PeaceforTexas
Because of the Open Carry gun law here in Texas. #Dallas could happen again! #EndOpenCarry
The other part of the problem is those God damn bastards in the Senate who voted for the open carry law. It's bullshit!
we need more of this!

@davidfrum naturally. What color was it when those citizens were murdered?
Be nice if the WH would do the same !!
Amazing words - loved all the way from Nairobi KE.
HOT ITEM A Must Post To http://rebelmouse.com/hippadrone  http://rbl.ms/1IVXi8v 
Thank you very much!
Fabulous, dear Gov.! 
We love our #MenInBlue ! 󾓦
#DallasPoliceShooting
you make me proud to be a Texan. You honor us every day. #Texit
This is a shining example of true leadership. Maybe @POTUS will light the @WhiteHouse yellow to show his cowardice.
Our President would never think of doing this.
could light it purple for all I care. System is corrupted
@WarBird303 if the shooter were a white guy saying he wanted to kill Black ppl this Madison would be on fire.
@EWErickson way to lead by example! Well done!
Nice touch, Greg. But what is the answer. With the POTUS seemingly trying to inflame matters, how can it be stopped?
well we sure know where @GovAbbott stands
That's fabulous! What a wonderful tribute!
@JoeTalkShow #ImWithBlue
Thank you! White House should also be lit in blue. #DallasPoliceShooting #WhiteHouse
Won't see that under the current @POTUS
No. But God Bless Gov Abbott. #BlueLivesMatter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9wd071tquo …
Thank you Governor Abbott. You are a man of honor. I saw it will be blue 5 nights, 1 for each officer that gave his life for us.
ahhh !
the good that may come from this is hopefully common sense gun laws.  You and rest of GOP are obstructionists and scum.

@GovHawaii your vagueness and blind faith attitude is obnoxious and your lack of concern for assault weapons is grotesque
we salute our fallen peace officers we will not falter
u need to DEMAND for 
Lt Gov #DANPATRICK 's  RESIGNATION!!   #NOW
MUST I DIE  http://stopleeclarkpasadena.com 
Listening to you speak & although not a Texan, agree with you wholeheartedly.  Well said!  Prayers to all!  
The nation wishes that the gov of TX would demonstrate respect for the peaceful expression of those who demonstrated honorably.
You are so out of touch!!!  What happened last night had nothing to do with Texas but you're shamelessly making it all about TX!!
I'm always bashing you.. but I was moved by your speech. Proud of your representation of our great state
Love you, Gov. You're a great man! God bless you! My heartbreaks for Dallas!Condolences to all the police lost and their families
@HeyTammyBruce thank you Gov!
@HeyTammyBruce ...Thank You Governor, a true American!!!

@DLoesch very classy. I wish our White House would do the same.
#InspiredLeadership #ThoughtLeadership
@KVUE what is @DanPatrick view on the matter ?
@DLoesch
@DLoesch Appropriate and deserved!  Too bad Pennsylvania Ave. doesn't feel the same. #TexasBlue we stand with you!
@CityofBudaTX very nice and proud of Tx- greg- we need you to run for prez # bluelivesmatter

Beautiful!
thank you sir
I wish our president was a damn honorable man such as u, thanks for being a proud American patriot
MT @GovAbbott: Tonight #Texas Governor’s Mansion will be lit blue to honor our law enforcement #DallasPoliceShooting
@FOX13News The White House should as well, especially since it has for other organizations.
@HeyTammyBruce That is both lovely and sad, Governor Abbott.  So sorry for the loss of your LEOs and their families and friends.
@frankgaffney 100% guarantee you won't see the @WhiteHouse lit up in blue- that's only for rainbow colors...
you need to treat the #blm as a terrorist group! And run them out of Texas, there not Texans and there not American's
did you drop out of the 2nd or 3rd grade?
From California, all my prayers to Texas and the brave men in blue who keep civilization intact!
@DLoesch Whitehouse should too. Sad they only do it to honor abominations.
