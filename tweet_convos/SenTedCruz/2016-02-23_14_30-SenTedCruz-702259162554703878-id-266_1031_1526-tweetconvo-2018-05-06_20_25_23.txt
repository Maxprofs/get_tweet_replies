@SenTedCruz @A_M_Perez Does that document have any meaning in the law or is it just window dressing? I know what my guess is
@A_M_Perez @SenTedCruz so if decide to ignore it there's no recourse. Not worth much
@A_M_Perez @SenTedCruz Lets hope so, but they've screwed us before. Seeing is believing. BO has 10 months to twist arms and sweet talk.
@A_M_Perez @SenTedCruz Like I say, let's hope so.
@SenTedCruz 
TED CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT 2016 
@SenTedCruz And you still haven't denied being the Zodiac Killer.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Suspending the Constitution and violating your oaths of office. Didnt that oath end "...so help me God."?
@SenTedCruz @DeanStJames #Cruz's poison pill lies.. https://youtu.be/EzouQIF8OR4  via. You never What? Just be honest. ...
@SenTedCruz Typical of your belligerent and obstructionist approach to being a senator: how could you possibly be an effective politician
@SenTedCruz Must be nice, to be able to not do your job and still be employed and paid.
Thank you.  Keep a stiff and resolute spirit. @SenTedCruz @CaptYonah
@SenTedCruz @PolitiBunny now let's hope they don't crumble under pressure
@SenTedCruz Ha.  Watch it be @HillaryClinton.  You just going to accept whoever she nominates if she wins the election?
@SenTedCruz traitor to our country and our constitution
@SenTedCruz let then fight against trump and don't get directly involved you will get those  votes at the end
@SenTedCruz Unfortunately Cruz Does NOT understand the Constitution. President Nominates the Judge and the Senate Confirms or Denies Judge
@SenTedCruz Excellent and thank God! It is the voice of the people!
@SenTedCruz isn't it time to stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about the country you represent?  Oh wait....that's Canada...
@SenTedCruz  Cruz and Rubio need to man up, work together , to beat Trump, for the good of the country!
@SenTedCruz You should all be prosecuted for dereliction of duty.
@SenTedCruz that's in direct violation of the Constitution.
@SenTedCruz @CheriJacobus #DOYOURJOB
@SenTedCruz @GenGSPatton  Amen!
@SenTedCruz With your logic, 1/4 of the time a president can't make nominations.  Dems are winning because of stunts like this. ╰⋃╯ლ(´ڡ`ლ)
@SenTedCruz THATS THE REPUBLICAN DICTATORS & THEIR EVIL DECISSION & SATAN M O cONNELL. THEY DO NOT DO THEIR CONSTITUNAL JOB OR OATH THEYTOOK
@SenTedCruz keep up the good work
@SenTedCruz continuing the senatorial tradition of doing nothing while pretending to love the constitution.
@SenTedCruz Thank you. Continued prayer for strength and grace for you and your team. God Bless.
@SenTedCruz Then the SJC members need to resign for failing to uphold the oath they swore when they got the job
@SenTedCruz I support this decision
@SenTedCruz  Trump is eating your lunch for this very reason and is taking over your party. Have hearings and vote no.  Scared of outcome?
@SenTedCruz and we won't take any shit from the justify text button either
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz And they will face the consequence in the 2016 elections.
@SenTedCruz what a bunch of idiots. #DoYourJob #trumpiskickingyourass
@SenTedCruz @FreedomChild3 is Rubio qualified?
@SenTedCruz #FeelTheBern #NotMeUs
@SenTedCruz it's funny because you're not going to win the election and more Americans are seeing through the GOPs lack of giving a fuck.
@SenTedCruz @TexasGOP Fellow Americans THANK U TEXAS 4 voting 4 TRUMP!!!! Make America Great!!! Thank U!  
@SenTedCruz #SenateJudiciaryCommittee Nice collaboration here, but let's make sure your arguments are fully formed.
@SenTedCruz @chris_badura I will be more relieved after the swearing it, but that's good for now.
@SenTedCruz 
What happens if the Republicans loose?  Wouldn't you rather have the devil you know vs the devil you don't know?
@SenTedCruz @LibertyBell1000 Hold strong to these convictions.  The American people are in full agreement--at least the ones who count are!
@SenTedCruz @PattyforCruz1 Running for President and doing his Job!!!
@SenTedCruz Then I guess you don't believe in the Constitution. #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz if they had any balls, Republican pussies would ALL sign not just the top clowns
@SenTedCruz Thank you!  We are praying for you. Stay strong. We appreciate your diligence and love for our country.
@SenTedCruz So much for "strict" constructionist, more like convenient constructionist.  Fulfill your Constitutional responsibilities.
@SenTedCruz What Constitutional power grants the Senate the authority to choose the administration that appoints Supreme Court justices?
@SenTedCruz Obama and his fear mongering is over. He could never unit the two parties and dump all the blame on the Republicans. Typical dem
@SenTedCruz , the Senate needs to do it's job. The Republicans need to do more than obstruct. The people HAVE spoken...remember?
@SenTedCruz first be careful what you ask for.  If this is what next #POTUS Does in #1st100days. That's all you'll get for the next1200+
@SenTedCruz THANK YOU! Have 2 0bama choices on SCOTUS & 1 is ACTIVIST who THREW Military Recruiters OFF her Campus! Should've REJECTED her!
@SenTedCruz thank you sir.  God bless you.
@SenTedCruz @MedvedSHOW This is really a matter of: are you a man of your word?  Don't worry Medved, McConnell isn't. He'll do what you wish
.@SenTedCruz Urging every fair minded American to call their Congressman and strongly protest the Republicans & Cruz on this issue.
@SenTedCruz  OBSTRUCTIONIST
@SenTedCruz will you wait another 4 yrs if a democrat is elected? Continue to demonstrate ur lack of ability to negotiate
@SenTedCruz And you're proud of this? At what point does your obstructionism here and elsewhere amount to treason?
@SenTedCruz @TheFamily1stAct -Let's  #SupportFamilyPreservation with the #TitleXIX &TitleIVe $ & #StopForcedAdoption
@GammaRae206 @SenTedCruz Thank You Rae Busch for stating the Truth!
@SenTedCruz #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz Thank you! @Saint_Obama
@SenTedCruz don't you think this is #hypocritical that the #Republican party refuses to do their job, #whateouldyoudoifBushwasinoffice
@SenTedCruz @5sahandful By staying in the race, the next SCOTUS appointee is. . .Maryanne Trump Barry, defender of partial-birth abortion.
@SenTedCruz So again the senate is not doing the job they were elected to do! Those who won't do their job should be fired!
@SenTedCruz That is why Trump is winning.  #Senate #Fail #SCOTUS
@SenTedCruz way to refuse to do your job, again.
@SenTedCruz Way to go! Way to keep to that traitor in office out! You have my full support Senator!
@SenTedCruz Awesome watching this train wreck as it happens! This is how Republicans lose the presidency and congress. #GOPBrats
@SenTedCruz How childish.
@SenTedCruz thank you
@SenTedCruz As a front line government employee can I get paid for refusing to do my job? Kthx. #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz = partisan hypocrite; you bear false witness; you know it's wrong & hurts WE the people. ~who else doesn't compromise? Babies.
@SenTedCruz so nice of you all to make it easy to know who exactly needs to be charged with obstruction of justice
@SenTedCruz thank you, Senator.
@SenTedCruz whoah! Teddy bear actually showed up to is job in Washington to sign that!?!? #WakeUpAmerica #BlackHistoryMonth
@SenTedCruz that you take such delight in obstruction is troubling. The GOP is like my lazy uncle-hasn't worked in years.
@SenTedCruz This is exactly why Americans are livid. Go ahead and play your games. We intend to bring you down.
@SenTedCruz Sir, do you believe you still have chance to defeat Trump?
@SenTedCruz you will regret
@SenTedCruz Why do you senators not want to do your job?  And you expect us the people to let you get a promotion to be @POTUS #doyourjob
@SenTedCruz Shouldn't they be doing their job? Remind me not to vote for them. This behavior doesn't help America.
@SenTedCruz Now stop Gitmo closing and the terrorists coming here. He'd work to release them right before the next POTUS is sworn in.
@SenTedCruz WHAT is wrong with you? This is why no one likes like GOP anymore and you will LOSE to TRUMP. You are acting like a CHILD!
@SenTedCruz way to go Senator, keeping the streak of doing nothing to benefit America, when should we expect the next shutdown?
@SenTedCruz you and the rest of your group are cowards. Do your job.
@SenTedCruz That means you
@SenTedCruz  Justice Scalia is rolling in his grave right now.

@SenTedCruz Rafael & his fellow Gop clowns are Treasonous.
@SenTedCruz that is despicable. You are not very good at your job. Impeach any obstructionist in senate
@SenTedCruz What a shameful stance for the Republicans to hold.
@SenTedCruz ....u would not hold the same opinion if it happened to be a liberal judge dying with a Republican president in office.
@SenTedCruz crawl back in your Canadian hole and go away.  TRUMP2016
@SenTedCruz - demonstrated ability to work in the system is a requirement for my vote. Hold hearings! @Reince @WSJ @Reuters @NPR
@SenTedCruz It will be hilarious when President Clinton appoints a much more liberal justice in January 2017.
@SenTedCruz @Ruach321 Great letter.
@SenTedCruz If they refuse to advise or consent, it is not a functioning committee.
@SenTedCruz What an abdication of duty.  Hardly original intent there.  Scalia would barf on you and your fellows...  True colors fly!
@SenTedCruz You call yourself a Constitutionalist? You are not. You're a partisan politician. A slimy one at that.
.@SenTedCruz good thing that won't be you!
@SenTedCruz Congrats Ted for "defending" the Constitution by going against the process it sets forth for a #SCOTUS nominee. #GOPObstruction
@SenTedCruz where is that in the constitution?
@SenTedCruz @Ruach321 #CCOT Sen. Cruz, please provide a copy of your US Government issued birth certificate all born abroad citizens get. TY
@SenTedCruz And what if that is Hillary, Bernie, or Donald?  Grow up and stop acting like obstinant children! #DoYourJob #SCOTUS #gettowork
@SenTedCruz You are truly a liar.
@SenTedCruz so much following the #Constitution to the letter 
#GOPhypocrisy
@SenTedCruz DO YOUR JOB!!! Maybe the people want something different then a single sighted conservative. The constitution says so.
@WitkowskiTrish  Please Shut Up. The people want something different than a dim-witted libtard.
@SenTedCruz Do your fucking job! Investigate and vote on the nominee selected by the President.
@SenTedCruz You shouldn't be paid if you refuse to do your job.
@SenTedCruz do your job! Give fair hearing vote up or down, end of story but DO YOUR JOB! Obama still on his last term!
@SenTedCruz Once again, republicans disreguard our constitution. We wont forget

@SenTedCruz Karma has her eye on you, can't wait to see what she has in store for you! #byebye
@SenTedCruz Instead of doing the job entrusted to you by the voters of Texas, you have become a partisan hack.
@SenTedCruz Sorry Mr Cruz, the Republican Congress & Senate are notorious for saying what we want to hear, then stabbing us in the back.
@SenTedCruz As Chuck Schemer said: They (The Republicans) will give in before the election. Given the Republican Record, I think he's right
@SenTedCruz As usual you fail to do your job. #onetermsenator #ANYBODYBUTTEDCRUZ
@SenTedCruz Bravo!
@SenTedCruz I don't see @marcorubio signature . That's why Ted is the man #TED2016
