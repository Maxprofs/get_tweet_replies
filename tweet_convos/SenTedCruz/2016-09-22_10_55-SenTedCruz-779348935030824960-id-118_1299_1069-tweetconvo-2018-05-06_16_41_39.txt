I think it is a mistake as well.
I disagree. ICANN sets high-level policy for assignment of IP addresses and DNS names, only.
ICANN has nothing to do with censorship or free speech. Their policies will not change.
I think it is a mistake, not necessarily for free speech reasons, although that is potentially one.
Why do you think it is a mistake?
@BULLOMETER how?
Countries will have access to our Internet. It will destroy #FreedomOfSpeech globally.
#UN resolution 1618
you can't say nigger or that Muslims are terrorists and not get fired in USA
That is what the First Amendment is for!
If you have such a rotten boss keep your tape recorder close!
I don't live in oba,a dictatorship called USA. ICANN changing hands won't change anything
What can we do to stop it?
@Trump4Pres0225 You will be taken down if you criticise Islam. worse than the repeal of the #SmithMundtAct
@SenTedCruz @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @FoxNews @ABC somebody stop Obama from taking away 1st amendment & giving away the internet
HOW CAN WE STOP THIS?  Can it be stopped?
@SenTedCruz  How can we stop #ICANN?
Thank you for your support of #InternetFreedom
I'm proud to say you are my senator, sir; I ask you to hold the line and not endorse anyone for POTUS this year.
looks like hes gonna endorse the guy that believes the opposite of what cruz has been preaching.
Lord, I hope not.
@Trump4Pres0225 That's what I'm afraid of. No 1st amendment.
Why have we not been made aware of this issue?
Such a tiny Fox News mind you have.
@RepMarthaRoby deer Marta what can be done to stop this
@dixiefortrump 

I can see why people have thought #Obama is the Antichrist!
Are you guys really this stupid?  This doesn't mean what you think it means.
In re US interests, #Obama's been most destructive CIC in history.  And don't forget his handmaidens:  #Congress AND #Media.
@SenTedCruz we need the #Congress 2 get off their asses & STOP this bullshit
This far-right guy Bolton was behind the Iraqi war. And he is free, not in jail?
@SenTedCruz how do we stop this?!? Pls help!!
more fundamental change of things we do not want changed -- ongoing loss of freedoms
@KellyannePolls why isn't DJT talking ABOUT this? #HillarysHealth!Give away control of Internet NUTS like Hillary
How can we give the POTUS this much power?  We need to pass limits on what the Executive Branch can do.
@dyanjae Why didn't they EXTEND IT? They must've wanted it to end! Can't extend til we get a real president in & why not?
STOP IT STOP IT NOW!!!!
@CruzNewsLive another idiotic move by Obama. This can't happen
@SenTedCruz https://twitter.com/kentuckyblacc/status/779447432648200192 â€¦
@SenTedCruz How cute to stir up the deporables with this nonsense. Fred just shit himself, you happy?
@SenTedCruz 
BESIDES complete censorship we will be charged each Month to access it! We must remain in control!
@SenTedCruz it cannot be aloud!!! Censorship will be heavily in effect!! We must stop POTUS from doing this at all costs!!
Tell them to go sit on a cloud.
Why did elected officials bend over and take it from OBAMA? You gave our freedoms away! WE the People, not OBAMA'S COUNTRY
Who is giving this away? Another Obama legacy? How about let's stop this now.
@jensen1230 this must be stopped. It can not be undone. It will be the beginning of the end of our 1stA.
Whoever controls the information, controls the world.....
Since anything Obama does is nefarious, by definition, this is/will be. Calling Congress, cleanup on aisle 6
@SenTedCruz

Honestly, I just see zero benefit in doing this. As Trump says, if it doesn't benefit U.S. don't do it.
@Billrollins6 Well, we knew net-neutrality was about controlling access not improving access. Here's the other shoe.
@BeachDreamin291 why is no body talking about this
I don't know but we should be!! @AmbJohnBolton
The end of free expression & free speech in the classical sense! The Chinese will co-op it/ control it. Thanks, Barack Obama.
I hope president Trump uses you and his administration
God bless you Ambassador Bolton
@hale4jesus More concerned about Internet and Hillary then Ted endorsing Trump
What can we do to stop it?
@SenTedCruz Illegal, unconstitutional and criminal!
You also thought there were WMDs...you an idiot! STFU and crawl back under the rock from whence you came...
@SenTedCruz This is pure insanity What kind of deal is Obama getting to give our internet control away? He hates the USA
The New World Order, a work-in-progress. Governing of the AMERICAN Internet by "others" anti-Freedom of Speech
@SenTedCruz Chartered like the U.N with the USA primarily providing  funding (in perpetuity)
Sometimes I simply cannot believe how stupid we are for having elected an anti-American bozo as POTUS.
@SenTedCruz It must be stopped!
Obama wants end to freedom on the Internet
Stop this
@SenTedCruz we lost the country , nasa, freedom what's else ... Thanks Obama
@SenTedCruz congress needs to take action to #STOPinternetControl by Obama #1A will be abridged
Left's plan to end discussion of political ideas. While the Constitution prohibits this, ceding the internet will accomplish.
is there nothing that can be done to stop it????
heard that years ago. We need you to fix this nonsense
@dwinegar1957 It's hard to decide on the top dumb things lately, but this has to be in the top three.  This is beyond stupid.
that makes the 88th reason he need's to be executed !!
@Mike_Beacham how can it be stopped? There has to be a way to undo what our treasonous president has done.
@Mike_Beacham can the U S start up another internet?
@Mike_Beacham
Oh please, your party wants to end #NetNeutrality don't act you give a shit. You don't have a clue. #iraq #tlot
@heifer109 :this is bone 1. Soros is interested in control 2.silence free speech and truth.
@NetworksManager so besides Cruz... Who else is going to tell obuma what's up?.......
Didn't have to use it before it became popular so won't be a big deal stopping use of it.
how can 1 man turn it over without Congress?
Thank u!& experts talk abt beefing up cyber security,they seem iggnurintt of current affairs. @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
OUR internet is one of OUR pillars of national security. @SenTomCotton
see above @TGowdySC @ChuckGrassley @RepMikePompeo @RepMcCaul @replouiegohmert @LouDobbs
see above @Liz_Cheney @realDonaldTrump @RepPeteKing
Tell all to email their congressman and senator.  9 Days left!
This is such Insanity!What is the World Coming to?Evil is Winning!America Stop this Craziness! We Need #EvanMcMullin Patriot
@Kittens4milk It will end up like the invasion of a immigrants. Completely undocumented or vetted!!!
@AdrianaCohen16 What have we become lost all common sense we now live in fantasy land with a bunch of morons.
Just another step Obama is taking to destroy things that use to make America great!
Former ambassador John Bolton on the impending internet transfer. Who's praying, and calling their congressperson?
THE MILITARY OWNS the Internet...ONLY THE DEPT OF COMMERCE UNDER LICENSE FROM THE DoD HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE INTERNET!!!!
@PrisonPlanet , we've got to get people mobilized on this.
So why is Obama doing it?  He wants US to not have control!!
If the US Army invented it why are we giving away control?
70 year old, not yet retired executive  and I agree with you 200%
when do we take back our country? Obama is the enemy!
I guess North Korea will be happy about this!
thank you Iman Obama.....
Can it be stopped?? (Also, wish you were running for President.)
So how to stop him?  He's got an add'l 4 months!
can we get it back if we get a real president?
Another Obama move to relinquish our freedoms because we are a cruel nation who have victimized so many since our founding?
The Imam Obama wants to give it to Iran.
Back to the library. Intern Pain in ass . Causing social misfits
sooooo what you doing to stop it. Are you like a monitor but do nothing to fix?
Maybe that's a good thing.
I consider this another example of Obama not acting in the best interests of Americans. He actually behaves as R enemy.
And why do they want to do this?
No checks and balances.
Obama is on the impression, he will lead UN; to control the world. Trump will ave his black ass in jail
terrible.hope we can reverse it
and it will be one more thing we can thank Obama for, just lovely..
I didn't think that this is true. But now that you've said it, I know that it's true! This is crazy #

And R we just going to sit by and allow this to occur??? NO!!!!!
please RT endlessly.
