Here's a 1989 seed. When will the rains come?
He is a joke. "... he said "modernization means wholesale westernization, choosing a human life is choosing a Western way of life."

A: Yes. China has become 1st country since Germany under the Nazis 2 have a Nobel Peace laureate die in custody #LiuXiaobo #CarlVonOssietzky 
Pulitzer, Noble etc all western publicity to interfere in other countries.
and we carry the water
#SweetsWay had a banner to that effect !
O-:
#WeAreSeeds
Some Chinese opposition slogans remind me of a woven banner we had at college. It simply said PEMBROKE SAYS NO. They say it's been lost.
Translation plz.
"To see things in the seed, that is genius." -- Lao Tzu
Even the smallest seed can become the greatest tree.
Beautiful & sage.
Beautiful. This is so true of anythg or any1 worthwhile. Liu Xiaobo, Mandela, Gandhi, MLK & many of their followrs incl u & me.
Tell your father: this is a wonderful memorial. Liu Xiaobo is one of my heroes. #neverforget
Liu Xiaobo was a genocide apologist
Amazing how this one slanted piece from a decade ago still gets so much traction. The authors and retweeters should be ashamed.
did he ever retract or apologize for those words? Are they fake? Because they are quite damning
And I am so sorry that I don't think the poem is a poem, and sounds to me not correct by biology science.
Depth
Hate to tell you, the gov's thought one step ahead of your dad& others:
WTF! Chinese gov forces Nobel laureate Liu's family to accept: cremation& scattering ashes (So no resting plc to hold memorial/protest) https://twitter.com/wenyunchao/status/885537681475858433 …
No it hasn't. 'Even if I were crushed into powder, I would still use my ashes to embrace you.' ~ Liu to his wife. https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2010/xiaobo-lecture.html …
I know this poem, among others. So do the Chinese gov. That's the reason, IMO
So he is.
I don't agree that Mr. Liu is a seed. He was buried after he passed away. He wanted to change China and he had tried and failed. That is all
Thank you for sharing his writing. I hadn't realized how accessible and vivid his poetry is, even a mediocre speaker. I hope his words
Reach many generations.
Thank you for share

The best way2 express theSpirit of a repressed. Will .#China  take its note2 correct its policies & practices2 stay humane vs. Oppressor!?
((Ugh. I liked something that Ted Cruz liked... I feel dirty))
OMG you were RT'd by @SenTedCruz

I think you misspelled a word
@OfficeOfRG This is where china is? Do U want to meet & xchange pleasentries? @pairamblr @handle_anonymus @acorn @MEAIndia @SushmaSwaraj
Liu Xiaobo Une voix pacifiste étouffée "@nicole_hong https://twitter.com/MagaliLin/timelines/885862632678461441 …
That's so beautiful and apt.
That's 
Beautiful!  
Never forget, china can not hide the truth.
Could you please translate the 2nd half as well?
See Matthew Salter's tweet for part two.
RIP Liu Xiaobo, your light will shine forever.
Wow!!!
So beautiful and powerful and poignant.
DAMN!
YOU MEAN TRUMP
IS A FRICKING SEED?!
OMFG
May his inspiration live on.
Wonderful quote!!

True words  in a false world.. 
I believe in God..
I believe in Liu
Lovely.
that is awesome
may I convert that back to text, or is it under copyright ?
#characters #Han #Nippon #Korean
Touching,moving and highly inspiring lines. 
People like Liu Xiaobo are immortal.
He's also dead
brutal , but true ....
Wow! That certainly resonates!
Wow !!!!
great man. tragic death.x
He is a seed what a wondeful message!!
Absolutely beautiful.  Thank you.
I just got shivers
Beautiful. Poignant.
that is beautiful.
Beautifull poem and great thought 
sincerely, no Chinese I know care about Liu Xiaobo. He is a symbol for Westners ONLY. @Steve_Sailer
Thanks
I am very upset as we have lost Liu Xiao Bo.
I thought that was mexican proverb
Beautiful!  That's a call to arms.
جميله
Wonderful!
Beautiful
Smart man

Quite profound ... I like it.
How many more are in prison And being tortured for the right for basic God given freedom of speech a truly great man and great respect
The Chinese are a tough resilient people and when they stand up for their rights they will Go all the way and LiuXiaobo was no different 
China will change very very slowly but it will change as it embraces the outside world
How beautiful! A masterpiece and so encouraging for all human rights defenders to keep on fighting.
Yes, he is a seed. #LiuXiaobo
"A barley seed does not die/Yet it is a barley seed/[When] a barley seed dies/So it can bring forth countless more barley seeds" (?)
everyone in mainland all hates the government
@NathanEnglander Beautifull.
Love this.
Open-minded ppl are buried silently in totalitarian stats,
They're not sole body rather are seeds planted will sprout massively out of sight
Do we deserve that kind of seed? Sometimes I feel like we Chinese people do not deserve a hero like Liu.
you are very kind nicole


@InAFlowerDress
恭喜习大大成为有史以来第一个关死诺贝尔和平奖得主的萬年圣君。習近平改名習特勒(樂); 恭喜恭喜恭喜恭喜恭喜恭喜习大大特勒(樂) ! 
Xi Jinping rename Xitler (joyous Xi in Chinese)
Reminds me of the beautiful sections of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass
That's China even seed can't sprout without communist party's watch. Salute that man thinking of democracy in China is revolutionary itself.
Ohhh wow
Someone should do it as calligraphy.
I can read, but it's a bit tricky to teach a foreigner...
YOU WANT TO BURY ME, BURY INTO THE DIRT BUT YOU FORGET, I AM A SEED AND WILL BE BACK.
Your father has a beautiful heart. Lovely poem! You're a lucky person to have him in your life.
"Yet what is an ocean but a multitude of drops."

Indeed a seed, the Philippines woke up after hero, Ninoy Aquino was killed by Marcos @cnnphilippines @nytimes
An apt tribute to a "Prisoner of Conscience". Our own Indian "Tukde Tukde" Commies have kept their "Conscience Imprisoned".
Beautifully said!
#PRC #Çhina Government can imprison & torment Liu MAN OF CONSCIENCE but #JUSTICE & #HumanRights will PREVAIL w/ #DEMOCRACY

WOW!
Beautiful! made me cry ...Thank your dad for me. Bless you all
Tears here as well. Respect for this seed.
It's true, sometimes we forget things like these.
#LiuXiaobo 当你们求助外国人并和外国人站在一起的时候、当你们只会坐在舒适的空调房用英文发微博推特的时候、当你们远离14亿中国普通人的时候、当你们面对危险迅速逃往外国的时候、 当你们面对警察时毫无骨气立即认罪的时候、当你们不愿带头只是空口忽悠中国人的时候……你们注定失败！
fight for liberty and equal humanity rights.
#PrayersForYourDad
Thank you for sharing it lovely
Thanks for sharing this. It is just a beautiful poem. Lots of admiration to you and your dad from Germany!
He is America's tool to subvert China. See, what has changed for countries that have been fomented by the United States?
演悲正隆，呵呵
RIP
Excellent. Thanks for sharing Nicole.  You're a treasure and pleasure to follow.
Honored seed, growing already.
沉痛缅怀晓波先生
That's beautiful and very fitting a tribute.
感谢
No he didn't. I just checked. Jesus did not say that.
Not the same.
Thank you for sharing this.
1/In case anyone is forgetting what kind of society #Xi #Jinping runs in #China, #Liu #Xiaobo was imprisoned for years for writing...
2/...less offensive political commentary than I write & read every day on Twitter...pretty sobering thought.
Repression of #FreeSpeech, #Injustice & #HumanRights Violations by The People's Republic of China #PRC are disgraceful & offensive to WORLD
Either this poet copied Avtar Pash or may be Pash did. Anyway, beautiful poem.
The first part originated with a gay Greek poet in the 1970s; since used 2 honour many murdered activists
Thank you for sharing this beautiful poem with us!
Lovely. Thank you.
If the seed is a bad one, no plant grows up at all
Loved this. Just perfectly said.
