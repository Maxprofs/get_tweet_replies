not to mention the leader state in maternal mortality. Nothing happy about that!
God bless Texas !!!!!
Looking forward to the day my beautiful state will be independent from you.
spoken like a true libtard.
You command of the English language is magnificent. I always enjoy a knowledgeable debater.
I would only recommend that you examine your own post. Ms. spells so great.
I have no idea how to spell "your." Is it threatening when people use a word with more than 2 syllables?
@tedcruz you are destroying our beautiful state! Shame on you!
MOVE THEN!
oh, ok Daddy, sure! 
@tedcruz Ted Cruz and Rick Perry are Pretty Great Too !!!
Wouldn't live ANYWHERE else!!!!! 
I have. Ca. & Ct. Couldn't wait to get back to the home of my birthplace!!
No sanctuary cities in the Great State of Texas! #MAGA 
When I was a little kid in MI I had a huge crush on Texas.  Y'all sent me maps and stuff when I wrote u.  I love Texas.
@tedcruz this is on you, Abbott! Shameful! Texasâ€™ maternal death rates top most industrialized countries
do you realize that data by state was only available for California and Texas?
@tedcruz give Texas back to Mexico!
& what's being done bout the pollution? Why won't u tackle the hard stuff? Big oil & Scott Pruitt too tough? #good'olboys #denton
Does any other State have its own Independence Day?  Happy 181!! 
@TXlege Be a leader who does not discriminate against LGBTQ citizens.
Gov't doesn't discriminate maybe back in George Wallaces time, a democrate BTW.
What is #SB6 about the?
@JBaker31826004 Chivalry, pride, patriotism and a clear sense of right and wrong are alive and well in Texas. We fight, not run..
Texas is a great state. Hope it stays that way.
It will stay that way because Texans never quit and failure is not an option.
@JohnTDolan Remember don't mess with Texas..
@SenTedCruz Neither of you loves Texas. You only exploit her to enrich yourselves.
Happy Texas Independence to you too. One thing ALL Texans agree on is that Texas is the greatest state in the nation.
I don't feel so independent in Texas.
THEN MOVE!
is Texas a state
@tedcruz .Hey Governor, how about you pay for the border?
@SenTedCruz it would be a lot better if our government would take interest in education instead of people's bedrooms. #IMissAnn

I am proud to call Texas Home.
@tedcruz "Remember the Alamo" Now look at Harris County, Texas Good luck #Republicans in the next #2020 #TexasIndependenceDay :)
@tedcruz @thilliii75 Hurts not to be home for the birthday party. Godspeed to you and the rest of our great Texans. HOOK 'EM
@tedcruz As a proud descendant of John T Edwards & David Shelby, I'm ashamed of the corruption in Austin.
Go Cowboys!
Ted you need to keep those Dems off of Sessions, we need his integrity at a time when only a few of you in Congress have it.
God Bless our Texian ancestors who fought, bled, sacrificed & died for our freedom!
not today.  It will be a happy Texas Independence Day when you Paxton, Patrick and Cruz are gone.  I can't wait.
Appreciate our friends in Texas from your friends in Tennessee !!!
@tedcruz How do U measure "greatest"?  Texans should celebrate longevity without arrogance; very little of TX is great
God Bless TEXAS! #HappyTexasIndependenceDay
