@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz @POTUS try less foolish spending.  let folks support themselves.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS And exactly what was your plan to keep funding the government? It has to be done.
@evil_avatar @SenTedCruz Hey evil, how much time do you have? Ted's full 90min speech last night is available on http://CSPAN.org .
@ramjet6990th @evil_avatar @SenTedCruz it was fantastic! One of his best yet...and he's has some terrific speeches..and no notes or prompter
@paulaspaulatics @ramjet6990th @SenTedCruz I really could care less, but only an idiot thinks we can't continue to fund the government.
@evil_avatar @ramjet6990th @SenTedCruz If you thought that thru U would C we have enough coming in every mo to fund all but lib give aways
@SenTedCruz @POTUS how can he spend all this money but tell banks not to give loans to customers
@SenTedCruz your a constitutional scholar, are there no laws to remove corrupt DOJ, potus,Hillary and jail them
@SenTedCruz @POTUS King Obama's #EBT CARD has no limit now...wondering what he'll sell it for?
We don't have a 'spending' problem. We have a 'Democrats won't get off the gov teat' problem.

@SenTedCruz #TedCruz
@BuzzSkedeebeck @SenTedCruz ...and don't forget the corporations on welfare, too!
You mean those corporations that pay the highest tax rate in the developed world?

@BlueMark55 @SenTedCruz
@BuzzSkedeebeck @BlueMark55 @SenTedCruz there should be a 10 or 15% tax across the board  Then you would really hear those corporations howl
What about a consumption tax where EVERYONE participates - top & bottom, saint & sinner, rich & poor?

@bonniieer @BlueMark55 @SenTedCruz
@BuzzSkedeebeck @BlueMark55 @SenTedCruz my tax would be more fair to the poor.
That's cool. Corporations paying 35% would definitely scream for a 15% rate. However, many want them to suffer. You're too kind!

@bonniieer
@SenTedCruz @POTUS there you go showing your ignorance are you sure your mom and Daddy aren't cousins?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I agree wholeheartedly
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I've said it before mcconell / boehnor the gift that keeps on giving, to COMMUNISTS.
@SenTedCruz @azoreandiver @POTUS Hello POTUS....the zeros on the card IS your remaining balance! Scrambled brain? We don't like Common Core.
@SenTedCruz Like the credit cards your boss, W., used to fund 2 wars & tax breaks for the rich?! Debt is his fault.
@MTomPatt @SenTedCruz sorry to tell you it was overwhelming support from both parties to fund Iraq war.  Plenty folks to blame.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Well Teddy. Seems you have to convince 59 other Senators and 218 Reps. Maybe pissing so many off wasn't the way to go.

@SenTedCruz @SovereignGuy @POTUS IT WORKED FOR FDR, DID IT NOT?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I think you and Rubio would make a great ticket next presidential election.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS NO it does not. It increases the debt and what tax payers have to shell out. Cut Obama off at the knees and ground him.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Paul Ryan should have the shortest term as House Speaker ever recorded. Can you believe they are sending donate emails?
@SenTedCruz @SpringSteps @POTUS If a parent had a child w terrible debt, the 1st thing they would say is "cut ur spending." Not borrow more.
@SenTedCruz In that there unicorn field, the yes clan can see spending cuts elsewhere.
