@SenTedCruz @srrabon_ those friends should be impeached along with POTUS.  Unworthy to lead if they cannot protect.
@SenTedCruz is Rubio there or is he to busy campaigning,
@SenTedCruz Sounds to me like you can't do your job.  Stop trying to blame everyone else.
“@SenTedCruz: We should protect America first. Unfortunately my Democratic colleagues are blocking that effort ” 
@SenTedCruz Because I truly believe that they hate America.
@SenTedCruz Harry Reid should be sent packing. All those refugees should be sent to live in his neighborhood.

@SenTedCruz the best way #TedCruz could protect America is to resign and never be in politics again for life he is a disgrace to America
@SenTedCruz Ted I like you but if you can't get the democrats and republicans to work together in the Senate how are you go to do it as pres
@SenTedCruz don't worry they will be quick to shift the blame to the GOP if something bad does happen  #cruz2016
@SenTedCruz remember this on election day
@SenTedCruz Im amazed how people rationalize a jihadist will no way enter with the refugees. Until their family is affected - no change. Sad
@SenTedCruz It looks like now we're going to have to build a wall around our red states and keep out the blue state inhabitants #US2USBorder
@SenTedCruz The Democrats booed God. Do you think they're bringing in Muslims because they share our values & respect for life and liberty?

@SenTedCruz Could we also protect individual rights first? This seems more important. Considering security only matters if we have rights.
@SenTedCruz At what point does the nuclear option become an option? We must have security or we will have kaos this we can depend on.
@SenTedCruz not sure when or why National Security became a partisan issue glad you are on the right side!
@SenTedCruz remove the electorate college.Issue voter id to legal citizens only.
@SenTedCruz use the nuclear option with simple majority!  stop playing games!
