US69 north & southbound between Beaumont & Lumberton are now CLOSED #Harvey 
There ain't no way in hell tRUMP's goddamn wall is gettin' built..@JohnCornyn  The truth is hittin' you hard! #Resistance #TrumpResign
Kinda like you did for the Hurricane Katrina folks? Prayers OK...just don't send any aid or $$$. Texas deserves more...so did New Orleans.
So did new york and new Jersey
Teddy, you are a tweeting fool if you think anyone thinks you can lift anything for anyone but yourself!!Just fade away, back into obscurity


Free Market and TEXAS GRIT will handle this! Check what shoes Fauxcohantus Warren is wearin today?
Useless sentiment - who cares what you think inside your head. Maybe stop deregulation of flood prevention and fund disaster relief instead.

. Bull, Cruz! You that voted against funds 4 Katrina. Dispicable, Mercer stooge u are, goin' down as nary a footnote wrong side of History
I have kids their family in Lumberton, Vidor & Buna. We are in Jasper. In laws in Orange/Lufkin and extend family scattered throughout SETX
Prayers for your family to be together soon after the rains stop.
NO WALL!  Rebuild Texas!
Prayers are useless you fool.  Climate change research and actually making infrastructure changes is what is needed.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't believe in climate change so goes the rest of republicans so sad @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc
Prayers
Well prayers might help but folks need health insurance
Expanded food cards, Medicare and Medicaid
Socialists programs
Call Berni he'll help
i like how you slapped that lib reporter's question about Sandy
Rebuild Texas, not a damn wall.
You know you better listen to abuelita!
GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
Here's an idea: resign Senate and pray full time.
They need boats, maybe pray for boats or how about get off Twitter and use your influence to summon some boats!
Ted Cruz/@JohnCornyn both face criticism 4 having voted  against $51 billion Hurricane Sandy aid package....
With hurricane sandy fixing roads & infrastructure is not pork. Saying otherwise is a lie. Hope E coast senators are more generous than you.
how about in addition to prayers you answer one for someone and you get out there and help.
Orange is getting hammered.  Never seen anything like this.
What goes around comes around! YOU VOTED "NO" FOR HURRICANE SANDY AID! You like to pray?  Pray for forgiveness!
This  NYer prays with you. Y'all will come through stronger than ever & until then good luck & sending donations.
By your Sandy schedule funding should get passed sometime in November. You are a hypocrite and you do not care about people...disgusting.
Prayers are wonderful! But what is being DONE??
I will support your state's people.  But u?  You are the worst #sandy
Global warming rears its ugly head.

@Gdsblssd1 @TxDOTBeaumont Thank you!

Praying for them!
Stop tweeting & start helping
FU Ted.
Prayers aren't going to stop #climatechange.  Perhaps you should listen to NASA and nature's warnings.
Unless action is taken immediately on #ClimateChange, our planet is set to become less & less inhabitable, @cmuffett1 tells @DavidShuster 
Just try not to be such a hypocrite in your future senate votes - action over words please
Fake
You are a sad soul, how dare try to capitalize on #Harvey but crap on #Sandy storm victims.
So you basically did nothing.
Buy some diapers. Formula. People Food. Pet food. Donate! You sick SOB!
Dear Lord,
STOP The FLOOD, RESCUE THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS..IN JESUS NAME
#HarveyStorm. #Harvey2017. #PrayforTexas
WWJD about climate change?
I wonder what Pence will say?  Probably wants to cut Social Security or medicare to pay for Harvey.
Video: “Katrina breaks my heart...but we must not let Katrina break the bank for our children & grandchildren” Mike Pence-2005 #ImpeachTrump 
Lord God Almighty please take this lost soul home. He has forgotten what it is to be human
Might be a good idea to give up cutting taxes on millionaires and building a border wall so there is money to pay for disaster relief.

Chris Christie: Ted Cruz is lying about Sandy relief http://on.msnbc.com/2x2T3Xb  
Terrific! That oughta not work at all.
1of2 You're a sick, slick politician. Talking your way out of why you didn't support relief for Sandy, but want it for Texas. Trump may be
Go work there instead of praying, coward.
And they thank you in return for working to deny them access to health insurance by sabotaging ACA.
Prayers for the Golden Triangle.

@SenTedCruz @TxDOTBeaumont
Prayers? Are you serious?
Go help tbe victims. Prayers didn't keep Harvey from Texas. They don't need prayers, they need help.
It is really bad in Beaumont. Prayers that this is the last night
What else will you DO? What specific actions will you take to help?
Then pass a CLEAN AID bill, a tax cut and the rest of the agenda.
We don't need prayers. We need all hands on deck helping.
Grl BYE!!! YOU NEED PRAYERS TOO. CRUZ DID SHOW UP..#Harvey2017
The only cruz I respect is the daughter who flipped buggers at her daddy

Thanks. I hope we get FEMA help as soon as possible.
Why isn't it working bro?
Lift us all up and impeach Trump.
ur fake
Too bad you didn't feel the same way about Sandy and it's victims. It speaks volumes about your heart  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP #shame
Excellent retort to Katy Tur regarding Hurricaine Sandy! Bravo Zulu!
Nephew lost his shop, and lodge. Home is now close to under water. Good news he continue to save others via his boat, he & his wife r safe!
da fuq are you praying for when your could be wearing a dope ass USA hat and idk sorry i'm high
#CensureTrump
If @POTUS expresses views inimical to our values, Congress must speak out. I'm cosponsoring a censure resolution in wake of Charlottesville. 
Looks like Sandy be gettin in Lyin' Teds butt crack. Repeal and replace Lyin' Ted in 2018!
So much lifting Ted, you got enough strength to vote Yes to using wall money for disaster relief?

TSC IntelBrief: Natural Disasters and National Security | http://bit.ly/2wiRzWk  

Trump revoked Obama's executive order on higher standards for flood protection right before #Harvey took off http://columbiaclimatelaw.com/resources/climate-deregulation-tracker/database/executive-orders/#13690 … 
Jesus just go away.... you're such a nasty human being
Never Forget TX...2 Include ALL TEXANS...Not just HOU
Are you going to vote for any aid to Texas? Going to be a #hypocrite this time or make some excuse about how this isn't like Sandy?
I'm sure he will ..if isn't 2/3rd's pork @A_SnowflakeInTX.

@SenTedCruz
Wasn't last time. Didn't stop him from a) lying about that, and b) voting to screw over the victims in NY. #assholehypoctite
Omg I just saw the pictures 
Heart breaking 
In kingwood 
Can't get in or out
@TxDOTBeaumont who is Heidi?
Remember this?
