That is such a bad idea on too many levels for 140 characters.
Us? A collectivist mindset isn't going to get you anywhere. Google voluntaryism.
There THREE INDEPENDENT BRANCHES OF GOVT!! INDEPENDENT BRANCHES. You and @realDonaldTrump seem to have a problem with the Constitution!
Fantastic!  I've been holding out my Bay of Pigs suit for 50 years!   Get my lawyer on the phone!

why keep saying "sue saudi arabia" if FBI&CIA says there is no evidence then why keep saying that? are israeli&iranian lobbies involved?
@AlanaBowker @AP and they want to shift sides and their part of the pie in ME and that's what ksa turkey Russia don't want
I think Iraq and Vietnam should be suing America.
aha. would be fun  @Farrukh_Abbas12
@SenTedCrruz
@Rambobiggs  good
and opec cut oil production
and Iran freezes its oil production
@SenTedCruz enough with Obama, arrest him, what can us,the people, do to help accomplish his impeachment/arrest. Please @TGowdySC
@SenTedCruz please, how much more does Obama has to hurt America b4 stopping him. He cannot&amidst not finish his term. Remove him
US Senate wrong. Saudi Arabian leadership is a delicate balance of western values and extremism. They just cutoff the hand of their ally
@SenTedCruz Obama has lost his power
not much punkin' actually. http://nyp.st/246TOEG 
@StefanMolyneux Obama is and has been so out of touch with the American people. Maybe he find his legacy on the golf course?
@SenTedCruz Political Pandering 101. It's like the Iraq War vote all over again. Lowlifes in Congress & WH r just reneging on their duty
@LightskinJesuSP please tell me this is a joke...
nope

Senate voted 97-1 to allow the 9/11 families to sue saudi arabia
97-1?? Then people ask why middle east hates America...

FINALLY!!! CONGRESS IS STANDING UP TO OBAMA!!!
It not just him my friend, its bush as well, who covered it up.
Hillary has to blame somebody...even though she has apologized.
@StefanMolyneux How would that even work?

Good luck getting them to pay up.
@StefanMolyneux  #ClintonNewsNetwork #ClintonCollapse #SickHillary #kissmyass
@StefanMolyneux I guess this time, good men did NOT stand by and do nothing.
@FrontRowBrian why would they want to open America up to lawsuits stemming from perceived notion of the same thing from other countries?
will never work 
Veto should stay in place. This is a dangerous bill and puts Americans overseas at risk. Diplomats, Military, business people. @POTUS
unbelievable

I'm not sure what the Senate is thinking..this is a dumb move. What will this accomplish? It opens the door for us to be sued..
well, next time an american servicemember is prosecuted overseas, may be these lawmakers can save him...this is sad

Does he really believe they will accept it? Why doesn't he charge Allah?
damn imagine all the countries that are gonna sue the US
--  What side will you fall on ?  :)
Ain't the Americans waged war on Iraq in a revenge for 9/11 victims and killed more than 1.4 M Iraqis?
Let's wait 4the Wednesday's Voting to know the American credibility> Today has been a great day, hopefully Wed's d same
@RestoreHistory lil deity is going to be wrathful
@SenTedCruz Congratulations to all who voted to override Obama! It's about time you all did something right!
new history is going to be written 
Finally 9/11 victims may get justice
@JoeRTabet amlah theft mastermind to steal nations strong. Operation bullying Class America bankrupt and want to steal
@SenTedCruz
Also, overriding Veto will allow to #SueObama & #USA for recent support of terror in the form of priping #Iran

@AP
Iran is a country, not a terrorist organization, It doesn't work like that.
Yes!
when are we going to allow Iraqi families to sue the American government for the killing of 1 million human in a terrorist invasion?
What?? Oh Sheet! What a massive showdown this gonna be now! The Oil Sheiks will have to put up or shut up now! This is crucial to watch!
I agree with the override, but if they do this then why sell $1.1 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia which will end up with jihadists
Because of the $1.1 billion you just mentioned
who voted against?
But they can't even hold a hearing on #Merrick being nominated for #SCOTUS ??
Disgusting. Yet another time when Obama is the only adult in the room. This bill is simply wrong on so many fundamental levels.
Great.  It will never amount to anything.  at least, it's great to see a veto on King Obama the 1st.  HC would be Obama 2nd.
Good justice for 9/11 families!
interesting
@KTLA Can't wait till Vietnam starts suing us lol
@ChristiJunior
EXPECT MORE WARS AND DEATH OF AMERICANS!
So now Iraqis can sue the US for an invasion based on lies!
Lol so far the only no vote is from Harry Reid. Imagine that.
Saudi Servants Obama and Clinton tried to stop it, but the people are closer to justice today
You do realize that will create a 2 way street?
amazing, and they cant do a budget, immigration  or figure out medical insurance.
I am so done with this countries government
They'll find a way to fail
It happened!
SUE THEM> HOW DO WE EVEN SUPPORT A COUNTRY LIKE THAT> OIL AND MONEY> 75 OF TERRORISTS ON 9-11 CAME FROM THERE> THEY FUND ISIS...
all these other countries are now going to sue the US for all the BOMBINGS we are responsible for, #FUCKINGBRILLIANT
and we deserve it
good, I hope every victim of US wars on bullshit sue.
Anytime anything Obozo did to our Country can be undone I'm all for it

#xijinping 云南政府把 #泛亚 打成非法，如其阴谋得逞，坑害的是23万债权者家庭，搞乱的是13亿中国人民的思想，败坏的是党和政府的信誉，丢的是国家的脸！ @XHNews @PDChina https://twitter.com/cctu1212/status/780724275166650368/photo/1pic.twitter.com/gOc8PYdCEM 
really wish they wouldn't; it's a pointless action & pointless lawsuits from a sue-happy nation.
The dangers I see are quite different. As a Scot I harbour little fear of Russia, America even China. All are a "soft touch".
House of Saud? Very different prospect. They are independently wealthy, very determined and very very ruthless.
that's embarrassing
@CGasparino hey this is important the Senate's not playing ball with President Obama anymore lame duck
it's more shocking they are working together and I bet Obama is freaking out along with Bush and Clinton
Yes
wow
@KDVR there is a backbone l!
When the reprobate talking about piety When talking about the humanitarian Cutthroat When America talks about the honor
this'll be interesting
they done messed up
