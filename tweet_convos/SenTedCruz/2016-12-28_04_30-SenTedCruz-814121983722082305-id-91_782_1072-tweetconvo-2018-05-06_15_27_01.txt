@worldgoneweird @FreeBeacon blackmail over a vote?
KISS: Gene Simmons "Obama he has no Fucking Idea about Israel". https://youtu.be/0YK7UGytvs8  @Kredo0 @DrottM @imsure @weaselzippers @DailyCaller
@danbongino @SenMikeLee @chuckschumer @McConnellPress @repjohnlewis @RepJohnConyers @SenFrankNiceley @jasoninthehouse Obama is Repugnant
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon There need to be sanctions against Israel. For far too long the world has let Israel pillage and plunder.
So Congress finds its balls...that's the Trump effect.
@vjeannek @FreeBeacon But Obummer will veto in support of his muslim brothers
it will probably be veto proof.
I hope and pray!
..about time!
Yes! The US has been so stupid to side with the palestinian terrorists.
@peddoc63 @FreeBeacon Expell the UN too
The US is Not 'Moving to Cut Funding to the UN'. #wednesdaywisdom #fakenews #propaganda #backtowork – at [Place name removed]
way 2 it take up the a** congress while a foreign nation dictates 2 our country shameful traitors on the left & right
@SenTedCruz Cutting off UN funding for the pigs at the trough would be a wonderful start for the 115th Congress!
@BeladonnaRogers @FreeBeacon GOOD! That's what the UN deserves
@WayneABryant @FreeBeacon expel the UN altogether. This is a fat bloated organization. Drain the swamp!!
Fantastic news!
2bad they didn't really do anything 2 them. unfund & kick UN off USA soil now! they r against sovereignty & USA
Do it! We the thinking American people are behind you! #sendUNpacking!
I pray this becomes REAL..!!! :)
If the UN is so determined to spit on the West then they can by God do it from the fucking East.
bout time!!!!
@colavs2184Why don;t they remove the cancer  there in the w/h.
hell yessss!
Congress is itself #Israeli occupied territory. Time and #BERNIE2020 #Democrats will b z end of @IsOccupation and #Apartheidisrael
felicidades congreso de E.E.U.U. al menos hay gente decente aun en los Estados Unidos.
I hope they do! The @UN is a farce!
@SenTedCruz I agree that we defund United Nations time to stop paying for these corrupt assholes
Wow, the US congressmen are acting like assholes here.
congress moving? Congress has been republican for 6 years, has done nothing and will do nothing lol good one 
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon I hope so
@IsraelNewsNow @FreeBeacon
also should not allow dips free access to city and restrict their travels to UN area only
Oh yes, @realDonaldTrump is definitely going to want to verify Obama's credentials bc he's definitely not American. @BeladonnaRogers
@daledamos  do this quicly please
REAL or JUST TRYING TO KEEP THEIR "JOBS".
That would be awesome!
Finally
Let's hope #Congress has the cojones to follow through now that #Trump will be President. #DefundTheUN & #EvictTheUN
good
.Congress couldn't grab their asses with both hands
lol lol that will show them. won't go anywhere enjoy the new years.
How about we lock them in their embassies until they pay all the $Millions in parking tickets etc.? Then expel them!
they need to. UN is evil. Anti-Christian, Anti-Israel
@WillisShepherd @FreeBeacon
@Forbes I ask @SteveForbesCEO to write about reasons for each of 14 nations to vote yes on latest resolution at @un.
I hope so, I hope the UN loses all funding from us and even as members, enough of the "globalist crap"
this is a good move, no Reid available to kill this bill
@dkrwilliams @FreeBeacon I don't believe that this will happened before the 20th of January 2016.
@SenTedCruz US is Israel's puppet. Stop supporting their military with billions of dollars that should go to fixing America.
Congratulations on your new account to hide your real identity.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon great news!!
@SenTedCruz Senator Cruz  please make sure Congress does this! Our current POTUS is a psycho hell bent on destroying US n Israel.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon 
From your lips to God's ears!
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon I hope this is true.  Long overdue. US out of UN.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Are they even back from Christmas vacation? The silence was deafening
They come back on Tuesday
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon it can be a lonely world & Trump is putting our country on a path where we will soon learn what that means!
@SenTedCruz  Big talk while absent. Obama picked the time &place for this &not yet done. Lies upon lies spew from this transparency.
Yes!!  But Hussein Obama has weakened us.  This will cause world upheaval.  Are we strong enough? -- IMPEACH OBAMA NOW!!
good.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon lets do this! Finally put Obama in his place!! He can't unilateraly do this!!
now vote to get rid of the Muslim-in-Chief
Thank you senator Cruz, senate, and house
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon I hope Congress can freeze this action deep in Siberia.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon The Right Move. And it only took 8 years
I agree
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Please, peace first.  No echo chambers!
Is this fake news? Just because TC tells you how he feels things should go doesn't make it a reality.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon kick all of them crazy people out of our building. Then destroy it and turn into a beautiful park. Tump Park
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon About time!  If it weren't for US funds UN would collapse
even though I agree with the thought, this is a knee jerk reaction and big mistake #UN #Trump #NoTrumpNWay
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Dear Lord! They finally R showing some backbone
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon great news.  Somebody needs to start taking actions along with Trump.  About time!!!!
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon GOOD!
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon The #UN can go to Communist China for funding. US can deal/fund supportive countries direct.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon LOVE, LOVE, LOVE if they will do it. Don't pay for protection either.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon It's long overdue! Get the Useless Nations off U.S. soil and payroll!!!!
Finally.
This will never happen, Congress has no b@11s!!!
about freaking time! The un sucks up money and is worthless!
Good for them.
“With a Trump administration , any nation that seeks to  delegitimize the Jewish state will need to answer to the United States.”
We hope. Jury still out.
.@Kredo0 interesting.  Don't think Congress has power to expel diplomats--executive branch function
Don't worry son, that will come soon!!
.@RossWalhof not as easy you think, nor as straightforward. @Kredo0
It'll happen; sooner than you think.
.@RossWalhof what would you say is the cause of expulsion? @Kredo0
