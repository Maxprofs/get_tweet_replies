@MMLynch01 Huh? @SenTedCruz was never in the TX legislature.
@freedomtex @SenTedCruz Did you read the article?
@MMLynch01 Wait are you complaining that Cruz should've filed an amicus earlier? Was that even possible, given the court timeline?
@freedomtex No. Mr WiseAss. I was commenting on his finally concerning himself with the flooding in Texas. Mind your own business or be gone
@MMLynch01 Still no idea wtf you're talking about, but you started this conversation.
@freedomtex Did you read the article??? HooooHummmm.... Yawn.
I made a comment. No one ever looks for wise ass remarks. Keep your miseralble
@MMLynch01 Um yes, the article is about an amicus brief. And you're talking about flooding for some reason.
@SenTedCruz of course you are how else would you win?
@SenTedCruz @GovAbbott @DanPatrickTX @KenPaxtonTX A law looking for a reason why it is needed @KKENNEY395 @grump7557

Texas is almost as much of a national embarrassment as you are.
If you really believed in liberty, you'd fight to end capital punishment. That is Big Government. Hypocrites!
@SenTedCruz  you know your hindend would be voted out if you let humans vote!
@SenTedCruz 
You would be proud of this law since it defransizes poor voters. Cruz is a scumbag.
@SenTedCruz @greta
@SenTedCruz Your a Jealous Sore Looser.Pull up those big boy pants and unite the Party instead of dividing it.
