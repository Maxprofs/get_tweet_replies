@SenTedCruz @Infidelzfun 
Will Cruz #filibuster as @RandPaul
?
@DumpDurbin as or with?

Because he has filibustered - remember the green eggs & ham ;-)
@Infidelzfun 
Yes but is the standard one filibuster per term?
I assume he has his reasons...
@DumpDurbin if ya filibuster everything, ya filibuster nothing ;-)
@Infidelzfun 
I can see that ,  my  feelings were that fellow insurgents may want to support each other even when it may not make sense
@DumpDurbin I'm still trying to figure out what happened with @RandPaul earlier.. Need to do my research - Im just a bit lazy now :-)
@SenTedCruz u r also corrupted u betrayed the American people long time ago when you declared ur loyalty to foreign state  Israel
@iammrsc @SenTedCruz America should stand with isreal!

@SenTedCruz @pryan Call yourself fiscal conservative and vote for this monstrosity Mr Ryan?  #DistrustRepublicans #Betrayed #corrupt #tcot
@SenTedCruz  Rubio is Obama in Republican clothing. Smooth talker no experience and an unstable record. No thank you.

@SenTedCruz government,we have 4$,we need to spend 6$,we want to spend 20$,but we will cut the deficit 50%,only spend 10$ saving you 10$
@SenTedCruz yell it brother
@SenTedCruz Yes Sir,With #Halloween just around the Corner. The #BudgetDeal is #Scary    when it comes to adding more debt.
#Cruz2016 
@SenTedCruz continue -- They just follow the pack and forget about it. Very unfortunate
@SenTedCruz continue -- Most Americans don't know what's going on in Washington.  If they would take the time to listen & understand this
@SenTedCruz I listened to everything you had to say about this budget deal to raise the debt ceiling.  Its scary stuff. SHAMEFUL
@SenTedCruz Corrupt Betrayal is an accurate description of the new Budget passed by Congress,between deal made by obummer&Boehner.
@SenTedCruz Have no words,am flabbergasted,no idea DO NOTHING Congress &Senate tanking gov't on purposeThx4 telling the truth,time4taxREVOLT
@SenTedCruz let's see who will be standing w/you in opposition when the vote is tallied
@SenTedCruz @ChrisLoesch No 1 talks about elephant in the room when it comes 2 Budget.We're paying 2 support millions of uninvited guests.
@sentedcruz If only the American people can depend on a two party system instead of this self preserving Washington establishment
@SenTedCruz People have less disposable income, spending ever more on a growing "govt compliance sector" marketing more ways to "help" us.
@SenTedCruz Why did @PRyan sign on it?
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz WHERE THE HELL R OUR #SENATE EMPLOYEES  HIDING? ALOT OF AMERICAN'S WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT2PAY THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL! #SHUT DOWN!
@SenTedCruz I am still awake watching C-SPAN2! #TRUTH TELL ON THE OTHER SENATE  EMPLOYEE BULLSHIT!!!!! GET FOOTBALL  LOUD!!!!!
@SenTedCruz you have my vote! Keep doing what you're doing!
@SenTedCruz I heard @rushlimbaugh  @glennbeck rail against @SenJohnMcCain -@SenateGOP version of @JebBush @RepMcSally ...vote @kelliwardaz
@SenTedCruz stand up for us!
@SenTedCruz it's a continuation of disregard for the will of the people senator.
@SenTedCruz too funny you are corrupt
@claudiasimon20 @SenTedCruz Go ahead, Claudia! Make your case.
@SenTedCruz I guarantee once a republican becomes president establishment congressmen will fight them much harder than Obama.
@SenTedCruz it seems like @brithume agrees with that the president should have 0 opposition to his destruction of the constitution.
@SenTedCruz what pisses me off the most about this budget is that @BarackObama is going to serve out his entire presidency with no pushback
@SenTedCruz  1 glaring reason America can't wait for someone other than Cruz. is we can't wait  for leader to catch up w/ corruption in Wash
@SenTedCruz Your intimate understanding of  machinations and nuances of the players involved. Can't be underestimated in value.
@SenTedCruz  Hillary and Obama why do they hate America so bad . Keep hammering on Main stream media cause that's the problem
@SenTedCruz and so are you!
@SenTedCruz continue to stand. Why people continue to elect senators who say the same things yet do nothing is beyond me.
@SenTedCruz I mean really. Voting for a budget deal at 1am?? What are they hiding? Oh, a spending increase with a Rep majority.
@SenTedCruz you sir  unequivocally are a betrayal to everything that is good and decent. Still waiting to see your birth certificate.
@EricEtslok @SenTedCruz  You are looking for him to say it was in the  USA when Cruz himself said he was born in Canada,,lol
@johnhan79583770 @SenTedCruz the question begging were either of his parents American citizens when he was born?
@SenTedCruz That's why your not going ANYWHERE, You should  just go back to Canada, You're NOT American, LOSER
@SenTedCruz U running 4 potus when u r NOT a Natural Born Citizen=born on US soil of 2 citizen parentS is a betrayal of the American people
