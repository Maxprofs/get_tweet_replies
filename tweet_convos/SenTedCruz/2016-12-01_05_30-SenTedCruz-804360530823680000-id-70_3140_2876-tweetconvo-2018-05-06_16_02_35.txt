.@NYTArchives and please remember, Rosa Parks...
Did NOT Riot,
Did NOT Loot,
Did NOT Burn the #AmericanFlag.
@baseballgiorgio @achs_fred  Woulda been SHOT, capisci? Spoiled white guy rhetoric.
@nytimes...not racist than other politicians during the time?!
@nytimes was referring to a Ms.Rosa Parks as 'Negro' I am sure so were the rest of the media! Now then how is @nytimes not...
@realDonaldTrump We refuse to give up our seat or our democracy!
We need more personslities like her around the world to stop environment degradation & biodivetsity loss!My plea is to begin...
it was a PR stunt, stop perpetuating a lie because it feels good ... I feel like I am taking crazy pills
How so? I honestly want to know, she helped rush in some changes, yes?
this is the only time I have seen it address, in great fashion ....
That was good!
It may be a so called man's world but never underestimate the power of a determined woman.I come from  family of strong women!
But she wasn't a trailblazer, the first to do it was a pre-teen poor pregnant blk girl, but NAACP didn't like image
. Politicians will not change the World.Ordinary people will do it by seeing themselves in other people.
Where are all of you when the environment needs you the most?
@LeslieMarshall.
46% of voters didn't bother to vote!  They changed the world today and it wasn't for the better like Ms Park
@WomenNMedia we should never give up hope in dark times in the era of trump but fight his gov with impeachment not my President
Way to take away from the accomplishment of Rosa Parks and turn it selfishly towards you. Bravo.
Ed Zactly ! Putrid. Hey....I have a black neighbor !
and bigotry still exists...and the media turns the blind eye..and delete..fails to report#WE SHALL OVERCOME
... begin with the stopping the North Dakota Access Pipeline!Let us not play marco polo @LeoDicaprioFUN,@mattdamon_,@Water!
to many  closed minds to comprehend @nytimes propaganda...#LiberalLogic #ThursdayThoughts
No, Rosa Parks only changed the USA. There were no segregation laws in other civilized countries.
Thank You!
. When they put their mind to it they can change the world.Rosa Park was and still is an inspiration.
@MichaelSkolnik How about a story on Claudette Colvin?
thank you @rosaparks
an amazing woman and human being what courage she displayed
@MichaelSkolnik I'm sure ppl were calling her and mlk the 1950 version of the word thug to describe them when this happen.
@MichaelSkolnik I was a toddler when this happened in America. Mam wasn't best pleased. Loved Aborigines my Mam!
@MichaelSkolnik how racists see kapernick they also see her as a thug and doesn't need to protest
in difficult times you need  people that are courageous enough to make difficult decisions # rosepark

@NinaAnne08 That didnt change the world. The hard work she & many others put in organizing & strategizing changed the world.
inspiring woman...love her!
@Arnaud_Laporte and Pascal Obispo performed an outstanding tribute to the Lady!
@Jordanetics
Faked staged event and she was a communist.
@SenTedCruz and she did it without burning a building or stealing a TV.
...or killing a cop. @NYTArchives @SenTedCruz
exactly !!  @NYTArchives @SenTedCruz
@RAMrants Please note it was Democrats who made the rule that Rosa Parks disobeyed on that bus.
@SenTedCruz The Rosa Parks incident was semi orchestrated. Claudette Colvin should be held in higher regard...
@Raul956 

Every year we go through this. 

Rosa Parks was a set up. There was a teenage girl that did it first.
Claudette Colvin, & I'm sure many others we never knew about, but nothing wrong with remembering Rosa, too.
My beef is-the media is lazy and goes with the easy story. She wasn't the first. It's a fact. But it makes for a simple newsclip
no argument there... they've spent the last year or so proving it, beyond any doubt.
Yes, she didn't give up her seat to a White racist Democrat
you mean Rosetta Stone
thinking about this, do we say "no more jobs to Mexico we'll negotiate"..keep Natl. Health or we'll take action...?
.@NYTArchives - look at that...the @nytimes headline calling them "#Negros"....racist much!?!?
Claudette Colvin was the real SHE-roe
@mboudry Je kunt dus ook je punt maken zónder mensen met onzin te labelen, verdacht te maken en te beledigen @SylvanaSimons
@SenTedCruz it changed the world until Obama came to Office. Now we're back to square one
today, the #GOP would have her detained as an Enemy Combatant.
LOL you'd have put her in jail for being a commie insurgent

Pursuit of Profit versus Racism
@HollandTaylor don't forget Claudette Colvin who did it 9mo before Ms Parks and gets ignored all the time.
she is my idol! Don't tell me what to do! U don't own me #RosaParks
And now the US "elected" the candidate endorsed by the Klan. We've come a long way. Shame has come back to America @jeandunn52
Oh grow up.

She is an inspiration. We need someone like her. Now!
@WomenNMedia A great lady!! Well done Rosa!
@SBNLukeThomas Who would've thought a womans strong will and sore feet could mean so much and help change our country #realhero
