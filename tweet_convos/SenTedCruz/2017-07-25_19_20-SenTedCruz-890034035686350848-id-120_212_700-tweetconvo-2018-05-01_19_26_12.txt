I'm not yet sold on any amendment. I just want government out of my healthcare.
I want free market->Ted Cruz's amendment fits the bill. I like local Drs making arrangements w\patients w\o insurance just dr and patient
I'm hearing his amendment bails out insurance companies. I don't support bailouts.
I heard that too. I believe money is to support the Medicaid debacle because so many people are on it.
Yeah... dat'd rite...
.@SenJeffMerkley rips Cruz's #ConsFreedom amendmt: allows insurers offer fake policies  destroy health markets

Spawn of Satan Cruz rabidly needs to be in a position to kill Americans. His hate is astounding. His services Satan & TRump over America
Cruz's "facts matter" speech would be more convincing if he weren't a yes on a bill increasing premiums and leading to 15m more uninsured.
@BetoORourke for Senate 2018!
'that left-leaning news site' labeled Obama's promise

"2013's lie of the year"

And it was, it was a deliberate lie #consumerfreedom #PJNET
JUST REPEAL THE DAMNED THING!!!! What is complicated about that? Remove its TEETH, it'll die in theory and in practice. Jesus!!
You better advocate #FullRepeal nothing less! @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP full complete repeal. Get government out of healthcare and insurance!

 Here are the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out: 
Thanks for your tenacity on this issue. #unleashfreemarket
Topher Spiro @TopherSpiro

Here's the part of Senate bill that admits Cruz subprime junk insurance is not health insurance at all. Oops!
Very common sense amendment!  Can you add another amendment to buy across state lines? Competition helps lower premiums! Thank you!!!
It's good to know that this Amendment is more important than your constituents. As I move forward I will advocate to vote you out in 2018

JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Had I the ability to choose a plan with only the coverage I needed, I wouldn't have gone without HC ins. in '15 for the 1st time in 30 yrs!
You cheered McCain & speech on senate process.  Then you continue w bastardized process.  You betray our country w hypocrisy.
thanks for trying!!
The only real freedom for people in your insidious wealth care plan is for them to die so u can give a tax cut to your wealthy supporters!!
Unreal that your amendment failed Republicans are a bunch of hack liars....
Why is no one mentioning buying insurance across state lines? Does your amendment include that? If not, why not?
You can take a day off...

Ted Cruz calls ACA the "biggest job killer" in this country 

ACTUALLY 
For a guy who made lowering premiums his big condition for a health care plan, Cruz was pretty quick to endorse a plan raising premiums.

Big idea 1: the Cruz amendment.

Creating 2 pools. No one believes this works including prominent Republicans analysts. 6

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Thanks. But please push for a #FullRepeal. Get the government out of the healthcare business!!!
Please be quiet. Delete your account. You are not a leader we want or need.
Your kids are probably as bad as you are, Senator. I'm sorry for them.
Cut the BS and do something useful. http://amp.usatoday.com/story/480446001/ …
I really wish your @SenateGOP colleagues would listen to you!! I trust your judgment more than anyone else's.
No matter how it's presented, it's still social. med. 4 all. I get that dems r obstructing. We won't have majority 2018. It's now or never.
Senator, with all due respect, #FullRepeal! No to gov't. overreach. Stand #unitedforfreedom & get this done. Conservatives r ready for this!
you can put as much lipstick on the pig, but i still feel you're referring to repealing obamacare. ain't ya ted?
I just wish you would have continued advocating for repeal of Obamacare like you promised.....
you better vote for the bill that comes to the table and not obstruct it. It's getting very embarrassing for the @gop
Remind me. Is this the amendment that benefits your 4th largest contributor? I think so.
#consumerfreedom should be "The Bill".  Not an amendment...
@BenSasse 
@marcorubio
@tedcruz
@realDonaldTrump
@glennbeck
@MichaelBerrySho
There was a time that I believed you & others would stand up for the free market.  Now it seems you're on your knees for re-election.
Thank you Sen Cruz! I have never comprehended people who will take a strong stance w/out trying to add to the solution = you rock! @POTUS
If it's not in the bill vote no. We the people demand more than Obamacare Lite. The vote that took place today should have in February. Sad
please stop, you are my senator and I beg you not to vote yes on these healthcare bills. They are a death sentence for many tx
As one of your constituents, I will work to be sure that you do not represent me or my family in 2018!!
Yes - keep pushing!
Thank you!  America needs your leadership and mature common sense!
Free market!
The consumer freedom amendment must be a part of the bill. 1. Drives down premiums 2. Expand coverage 3. Protects pre existing conditions
Why do you actively work against the needs of your constituents? I'm asking for a friend.
Great speech. What I would ideally like to hear is what I won't like about it so I can weigh it equally.
@SenTedCruz you advocating for 22 million people losing their health care coverage, you give Texas a bad name and are nothing but a fraud .
Wrong! 16 million would drop out because they have the choice. It would  by 24 million previously insured pre-Obamacare.
Do a national pricing index like all other industries do, Ted
You have to follow the Senate Budget Rules. It will take 60 votes. I know you placed a motion to waiver the count. Plus I could argue...
...the rest of your points. I know the Democrats will too. Cutting Medicaid like that is brutal.
More here. Of what I see.
Bad amendment. Premiums go sky high under it. Bad Senator, Bad Senator. #NoRepeal #FixACA
That is in complete contradiction of everything factual. HHC projections say it will LOWER premiums 7,000$ a year.
It's HHS & your numbers assume amendment attached to ACA.
Texas has the highest maternal death rate in developed world-what happens when women lose healthcare.Tell me again how the bill helps?
Ummm women don't lose healthcare because if you actually listened to the speech HHC projections say the bill expands coverage to 2.5 million

Dallas VA Hospital is the 2 largest in the nation and the worst rated by its own employees. Look at years of AES results.  Nothing changes
you are very bright Y!
Hello from Austin, Mr. Cruz. Looking forward to seeing you lose your seat. You're an awful Senator. We're eager to see you go. Goodnight.
Leadership in house and Senate being paid by ins. Co. No need for fed. Money to ins. Co. FREE MARKET!
no one wants your craptastic to get plan.
You know, on second thought keep it up it's apparent most Rep. Senators don't agree with you. So it's generating more no voters. GOOD JOB
While you're at it look into the mismanaged Dallas VA Hospital for abuse and corruption against its employees.
Ted rest assured TRUMP loves u,at least this week @MSNBC @DFWIndivisible @indivisibletxjc @indtx36 @TX23Indivisible
Hear that people!?! He hates you!!  #TrumpcareSucks
Haha. Why don't you try actually having an argument next time. Stop the hysteria and lunacy and come back with a policy prescription
Repeal then free market. NO FED GOV. as long as fed is involved we are one vote away from single payer.
"No fed gov" yet judging by your age I'm guessing you rely on some combo of Soc Sec, Medicare, and/or Medicaid.
Ted please retweet! Your followers deserve to see this!
We don't want your crappy bill. Are you deaf? Listen to the ppl of Tx and US! Better start looking for a real job we will vote you out.
And I will continue advocating for your opponent in the next election.
That's because you're a tool, bought and paid for by big business at the expense of the working family. You're a real immigrant success!
"consumer freedom" to go bankrupt when you break an ankle? No thanks @SenTedCruz #MakeCongressBlueAgain #MCBA
You have had eight years to put a plan together and you have nothing. Not sure you can get anything done.
Insist on the original Cruz-Lee Amendment or simple repeal or nothing.
We want an immediate complete & #FullRepeal of #Obamacare w/ NO subsidies, bailouts, Medicaid expansion or entitlements! @SenateGOP #Debt
That's the one that allows junk policies? Nope. You're not listening to the PEOPLE who want HEALTHCARE.
OK. This bill makes it cheaper and easier to get. You should be happy about it
Nobody likes you at work.
You need to support the people who want health care for the taxpaying citizens. Medicare citizens earnedGet illegal& scammers shut down
While you all debate I hope insurance companies will be wise enough to curb their greed & develop plans that work for people, while making $
Not content to have turned Mitch into a laughingstock, right?
@tedcruz for AG. I don't dislike Sessions, but only way to move forward now is to replace him.
Why? he is doing great look at how the war on gangs is going. If trump fires him it would be a huge mistake
You mean freedom from health-care amendment? The one analyst say will create a death spiral that you falsely accuse ACA of? Yeah no thanks.
I believe that is called a poison pill. For the first time ever, you are doing something right. You are killing the bill. 
You'll be voted out of office in 2018!
Keep the faith Senator :) thank you!
Choice is needed not mandates
advocate all you want at selling out healthcare for only some Americans...fixing ACA is what Americans want not repeal unless it's the GOP
Then why do 50% of American want obamacre repealed. Also the democrats lost three elections because of it so I'm calling BS On that tweet
Your amendment is not insurance coverage!  People who want it are betting that nothing bad will happen to them!  Shame on you!
Thank you for fighting the good fight. Sadly though, the @GOP is beyond repair.
Yes! Less government more options and choice! Let us select our own coverage options and make congress have the SAME plan as us!!!!!
Options that you can't afford. 
Not sure why not being able to afford healthcare is funny,you belong with Pelosi in an ivory tower doling out mandates,butexempting yourself
I'm laughing at you, dear. TRump care with make insurance for people with pre-existing conditions unaffordable. Hope you're healthy. 
Americans will not stand by and let the GOP dump stizt on them
We will rise!
Please advocate for THE WALL THAT WE ALL WANT AND NEED ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER. Thanks
That's too bad. #gonein2018
You do not advocate for consumers/constituents, only for big business and the wealthy. #disgusting #sellout
Thank you senator! Freedom living Americans are behind you!
Big Lyin Ted
