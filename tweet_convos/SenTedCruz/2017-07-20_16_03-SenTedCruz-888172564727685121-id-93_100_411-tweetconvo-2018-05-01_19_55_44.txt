Thank God I can't tune in!!!
I'm sure if you kiss Trump's ass often enough you'll get back in the good book of his illegitimate child Sean hannity
after the shit he pulled in the primaries, I can't believe you'd go back there. Hope he doesn't mute your mic this time
I want to watch but Hannity makes me want to puke so ill mute until Cruz comes on
You're both traitors
Tune in to @maddow @MaddowBlog @MSNBC  then @Lawrence @TheLastWord
Great shows, real news. Sorry crusty Cruz & slimeball Sean.
You are delusional. Sound like a typical trough feeder.

GREAT interview!

U CANT GET THE VOTES TED CUZ YOUR BILL IS A PILE OF CRAP....TREATING USA CITIZENS LIKE CRIMINALS YOU ARE!!!!
Watching you now. Talking healthcare, Obamacare repeal, tax cuts & promises to us. You make so much sense.
I hope #hannity @SeanHannityI doesn't sandbag you this time.
Hope to hear why you're not getting results on healthcare, taxes & wall.
You're MY #Texas Senator.  I expect results, not promises
We know the answer.  RINOS in the #GOP.
Ted you know it's Bull shit! We need to pass heath care! Jeff sessions should resign Mueller is completely out of control train w/no breaks
you forgot to say repeal in pass health "care" repeal
I won't give Hannity the satisfaction of riding your coat tails to boost his ratings.  You're too good for his insanity & disrespect of you.
He'll, Trump bashed him and his wife. Might as well let Lyin Sean get a piece too
I don't watch him, as he is as crazy as our president. Why don't you stick with @NPR or @NewsHour
sorry TRUMP channel @MSNBC @indtx36
You will definitely reach the low IQ/EQ GOP base on that show. Hint: call Hillary and obama names, they love that stuff...
I'd love to watch you, except I stopped watching/listening to Sean Hannity after the way he treated you and true conservatives in primaries.
My skin is crawling just looking at a picture of you with that dirtbag

Why are you promoting a bill that will charge people with a crime if they criticize Israel? Who is putting money in your pocket now,Ted?
Aaahhh so you were on fake news?
You mean Propaganda Hannity show? No thanks. Texas deserves better than Cruz.
Do your patriot duty to America, impeached the Prez.
If all the Republican was forced to have the same insurance as the American people they would come up with a good plan quickly.
#betofortexas
Yep- Hard at work playing Candy Crush huh? #GoldStarDad
you are SPINELESS Ted..
#toolsflocktogether
Hannity is a putz LapDog. Respect you @SenTedCruz, but you know Sean is a trump biased clown.  Human pretzel.
That's embarrassing.
can't you go on a respectable news show. FYI - it's not Hannity.
Hannity is Disgrace to conservatism.  Remember he was Trump's Lap dog.  He is a populist Nationalist.
I think  I will pass . Watch real news with Rachael. You are just a sell out, to Trump TV.
Only time I'll watch Hannity is when Cruz is on, since Hannity let Trump and his cronies lie about Cruz and his family I stopped watching
That's a lot of scum of the earth in one studio.
You both hate Americans #failure
foxnews,lol
hmm no
Looking forward to the softball questions?
Not even if your wife tongue kissed Bo Obama!
What do you expect from a guy who lets someone degrade your wife and father. No cojones Cruz. You let Donald emasculate you.

Yes, I will watch. I have forgiven u for ur behavior at the convention. Sean is a committed Republican worthy of trust. Be like him.
BUT YOU ARENT AS EXCITING AS TRUMP! SORRY
#MAGA
Oh wait, maybe bring up that push for term limits you were all for..and remember that time you tried to shut down the govt all by itself?
Can't wait to see you but you guys in the Senate y'all need to start showing some smarts right now I'm not saying much from you
Gonna discuss that ridiculous POTUS NYT interview? Or u gonna talk about ur awesome Healthcare bill?. Maybe u shud discuss the debt ceiling
Looking forward to it!
Just to see you, @SenTedCruz .

Big idea 1: the Cruz amendment.

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Senator, simple solution to healthcare. Give us the same healthcare you have. Repeal Obamacare now
He's on ObamaCare.  Try again.
Curious to see which sycophant will have their tongue deeper in the other's behind, trying to earn praise from the master @realDonaldTrump
I will... Hope you got something to say instead of redundant bullshit.....
Ted, if you must go on there be sure to mention Trump's recertifying the disastrous Iran bill.
Should use your time with healthcare experts boning up on how healthcare works,
I'll pass on the "I'm so smart smirks" as you and Sean discuss how screwing the poor is a good thing as long as rich get tax breaks.
Hannity does a great job of Kissing Republicans asses Hey Ted walk across 6th Ave to NBC I'm sure Rachel  @maddow would love to interview U
@Maddow would LOVE to interview Ted Cruz.. she'd finally have some viewers.
9 or 10??
Hannity doesnt start until 10pm, will be watching.
Answer why Rep.aren't supporting the president who we voted for and their constituents in repeal and replace!!!
Only if the PA's are handing out barf bags.
Much easier questions than constituents!
Not even when hell freezes over
Does he know you're the zodiac killer? Or that your dad shot JFK? He likes that sort of story so try to steer the convo that way.
You could actually do a show with someone who respects you, seeing as how Sean threw you under the bus for Trump. I'd love to do a segment
Both of You Can Go Suck an Orange 
 What happens when that much slime is so close together?
YOu get #CNN, that's what happens

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
#ReplaceRyan #ReplaceMcConnell #VoteRINOsOut
I'd like to hear what you have to say, but its not worth boosting that show.  If its important, i expect you'll diseminate it elsewhere
Yes and xan you please do something about the completely partisan, out of control and unfair spec invest? Will not end well.
Seriously Ted? Sean is insane. Not a good spot to try to make a rational statement about anything
Sean is a lying sack of shit, Ted...Oh now I get it!
Will you be discussing collusion?  or 7 years of broken empty promises?
He be discussing Cruz audio graphic memory cupcake.
Did you bring your tinfoil cap? It's mandatory equipment when speaking to Hannity. 
I imagine Hannity runs around his house like this:
Yep! I'll be watching, Keep fighting the good Fight Senator #TedCruz
i would never watch that drivel
