You did not keep your word.
@DMNOpinion Boo! I hope Texas finds someone that understands loyalty.
@DMNOpinion Mr. Cruz, please never stop fighting for US. Thank you so much for your dedication to our country. #Cruz2020
@DMNOpinion Basic rights and concerns for the human condition should ALWAYS be put first  before financial gain.
@Beth7316 @DMNOpinion Bc our GVT is "procommunism" it's ultimate agenda for NWO. Why wld they speak against it? Sad but true
Hillary jumped on "China" bandwagon during DNC speech, but didn't they illegally donate millions to her NY senate campaign?
@DMNOpinion Guantanamo.  Drone Strikes. Abu Gharaib.  America has so much to be shamed of.
@DMNOpinion for far too long Washington has allowed h1n1 visas, a lot from China, to lower US wages, a.d to steal US jobs......
@DMNOpinion We should remove their MFN trade status immediately. You need to work with Donald on this and forget the bickering.
@SenTedCruz
.@SenTedCruz @DMNOpinion Ur right about so many things Senator:Ebola,Climate Change,sweeping the SEC states,conservative agenda wins... ha!
just dropped you
@DMNOpinion it seems that standards of justice are dead. It's all relative now. Hope you agree with the perspective of the judge
@DMNOpinion you are finished politically
So TED...MAYBE it would behoove you to make up with DJT to save what little political career you have left...Just saying :-)
I'll bet if I wrote every congressman & senator about Red Commie China, I would not get back over 2 responses.  #Sad
@DMNOpinion trump has been saying this for twenty years.
Once again, your Tweets are irrelevant. You stepped on you Mini, and really ruined your minuscule career. You are very foolish.
you should be very ashamed of the speech you gave at this RNC u did not honor your pledge so how can you expect to be believed
.@seanhannity.@cvpayne.@Varneyco. @BretBaier .@DanaPerino.@PolitixGal.
who sent Lyrch to deal with China .....oh yea Obama
For too long the people of the US trusted you to be a man of integrity! Traitor
@ArlenWms @DMNOpinion amen. I agree.
@DMNOpinion 
I'm unfollowing cruz and voting Trump.
You are my hero! I am so very proud of you! Please keep doing what you are doing! The Libs are either very stupid are enemies!
I have searched but found no way to edit and correct my grammar mistake of using are when it should have been or. (or enemies!)
@DMNOpinion nobody cares what you think Cruz. Go find a party that wants you.
.@SenTedCruz

Speaking of truth 
When is the Republican controlled Congress going to admit an 11% approval rating is unacceptable to America
Everything about China is crap from their products to their govt. The sooner we openly acknowledge this, the better we'll be.
@SenTedCruz
Same crap Trump has been saying, but yet you could not stand behind him you coward, oath breaker. Cant keep promises, cant trust
A bit of Truth:  While China was lifting 400 Million out of Poverty; U.S., was sending 46 Million to the Poor House.
For over 15 years; China out-produced U.S, W/State Directed Capitalism. America's GDP barely budged under Predator Capitalism.
That would be a, "bullshit," Filito Cruz. Your good buddies - - our Predator Capitalists -  have sent millions of jobs to China.
Further, the Chinese hold $1.4 Trillion of out National Debt.  Neo-cons in this Country are just, "itch in," for a fight.
@DMNOpinion you started to sound like @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
you're not a patriot run in Canada. Obstructionism is bad for America. Your gov. shutdown cost millions & hurt US credit rating.
You wouldn't know the truth TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz if it smacked you in the face, although something has. Healthcare Vouchers for Vets!
@DMNOpinion I hear ya Ted.   But after the way you acted at the RNC, who's going to care what you say.
@DMNOpinion Stupid Kerry thinks Refrigerators and A/C bigger threat than ISIS, he's such a idiot it's embarrassing to Americans
@DMNOpinion STOP TPP
@DMNOpinion unfortunately his political career is DOA
Canada  Please take this Snake... do what you want with it... as long as it doesn't slither back to USA
