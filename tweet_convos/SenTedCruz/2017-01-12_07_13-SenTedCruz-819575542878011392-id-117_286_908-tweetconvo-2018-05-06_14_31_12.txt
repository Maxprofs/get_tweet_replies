Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz team up to defund UN over Israel vote http://washex.am/2jnakB7  
@dcexaminer, thank you, any entity that thinks their cause is more important than the American way, should be cast aside.
, leaders from other countries shouldn't have say over a free people.

Save occupation but allow millions of Americans to die by repealing Affordable Care Act with no replacement. Priorities?

?
Without Russia and China agreement UNSCR 2334 won't be repealed. International community spoke with one voice
H. Obama shows real colors. Defund UN and get them out of the USA.
@dcexaminer Israel shouldn't get a free pass to do as they please Mr. Graham
Palestinians won't recognize Israel as a country. UN anti Semitic and anti USA. They have to go.
@tedcruz @dcexaminer 
@dcexaminer AMEN
@msmoyaknow @dcexaminer

@tedcruz @dcexaminer Not generally a fan Mr Graham but glad to see you are on board to stand w/ Israel !
Awesome!
About time you did something positive. Can someone explain to me why Jews continue to vote Dem?  71% vote HRC?
My Russian Jewish friends are disgusted w this adm& bc of Obama terrorism increasd
@tedcruz wrong! you're both such fools; this is about a land grab by Israel & you know it; but go ahead, score your points
@LizEady1 @dcexaminer
I often support your decisions, even as a PA Democrat, but defunding the UN would be a mistake.
@tedcruz @dcexaminer why? Policy same as last 40 years?
@dcexaminer Thank you Senator!!

@tedcruz @dcexaminer Make Sec Kerry stand down now!
After the things you said about Cruz during the election you two are buddies now?
No I don't standwith Israel.  I'm tired of standing with them and they do nothing for us.
Israel needs to be slapped Why are we sending billions of dollars & are my taxpayer dollars spent to build up their defense
so you go after the UN? Childish!
@tedcruz @dcexaminer I support them
@tedcruz gaydar
@tedcruz About time Mr Graham starts acting like a Republican & remembering reason he was re-elected. Enemy is not Trump.

@SenTedCruz NOW GANG OF 5 MARCORUBIO JOHNMCCAIN LINDSEYGRAHAM TEDCRUZ & DEMOCRAT CHUCK SCHUMER CF MANEGING PARTNER F&F CPAs
@dcexaminer Come on, you were doing so well at being nonpartisan, don't ruin it now. #defenddemocracy #stoppartypolitics
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer bull, they need a two state solution and that would have impeded both sides moving forward.
IT'S ABOUT TIME I HEARD SOME GOOD NEWS. SCOT IN SC
Can you also slap back at teammate regarding threat to cut Embassy security and foolish move to Jerusalem?
Reality: not Israel, the settlements. Is everything Israel does sacrosanct in your book? It is for Ted; how about you?
@SenTedCruz I forgot Israel was the 51st state. Why haven't we changed our flag yet?
@SenTedCruz  Increasing to 5 THE GANG OF 4? BAD COMPANY & MISTAKE! Help Irael our best friend! CF Maneging Partner F&F CPAs
why not let russia & china who veto all good things pay 4 UN support 4 a while USA has to borrow to give to UN
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer why defund, just leave.
@dcexaminer One vote and defund?!More proof if that is what you want to do.
did Reagan slap Israel you all are so partisan
Agree - Defund UN.
@SenTedCruz Increasing to 5 THE GANG OF 4? BAD COMPANY & MISTAKE! Help Irael our best friend! CF Maneging Partner F&F CPAs.
@SenTedCruz We support that!
@realDonaldTrump @netanyahu  It wasn't a slap at Israel, it was a punch in the face.  It must be reciprocated.
@tedcruz @dcexaminer L, you take 10 steps forward and 30 back. U R an officer and a gentleman. Ted is worse than Trump 
@dcexaminer In the Middle East, the democratic nation is an enemy of the majority of its governing neighbors. No surprise
Thank you!
@tedcruz @dcexaminer  Welcome home senators
Your going to start War w/Iran that's needless b/c War always helps the top 1% & Corporations. Think what do Voters want?
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer you are playing into putins hands
and the Lindsey/McCain resolution is a slap at We the People. #LindseyMcCainMustGO!
@SenTedCruz @dcexaminer We must stand with Israel, so important to put Israel interest first.
@dcexaminer and why did you guys vote at 1am?
@dcexaminer Walk softly.
@dcexaminer Instead of defunding, every nation should contribute equally to its existence.
@dcexaminer The resolution was the World Community trying to save a People from being wiped out!
And your vote last night was you taking a slap at cancer patients. We're going to fight back against that immorality.
Push Back!
Israel wrong to build more settlements. This has been the accepted U.S. position for many years. Israel breaking promise.
@America_1st_ STUPID HYPOCRITES. They've lost their minds.
@dcexaminer thank you#neveragain#defundun
@dcexaminer Like George Bailey and Mr. Potter, I remember now why I don't agree with your politics. Unfollow.
do you have any consideration for Palestinians?
@dcexaminer I imagine that this will also defund our allies who voted for it.
Can you guys make sure that ILLEGALS do not get Healthcare? They are Illegal; tax payers stuck with their bills!
We should pull out of the UN. Stop giving them money!
Stop giving money to Israel for their healthcare too.
@dcexaminer nope guys most American Jews dont support nasty Netanyahu&want 2 state solution or NO  peace #StandWithIsrael
Would you please stop with this Israel thing? I'm a Jew who is fed up with the settlements!!!!!
@dcexaminer Totally wrongheaded move and cheap shot for U.S. political points - and I do #StandWithIsrael
@dcexaminer As i understand what you're doing, if you don't like how the UN votes, we defund them? Is that how USA leads?
yes it is DEFUND THEM since we are the main contributor
well clearly you don't understand what leadership is all about...
Clearly you have no loyalty to our allies!
As a Jew and Zionist w family in Israel, please do not.  The settlements have destroyed any chance for a 2 state soln.
Bibi is under investigation for bribery. How about you get back to the business of working for the USA?
@dcexaminer to defund the UN for the vote by sovereign states (security council members) is silly
Time to push back on all things Obama/Kerry. Appreciate your efforts. #StandWithIsrael.
@dcexaminer I was with you until now #offthedeepend
Would rather see hearing about compromised PEOTUS, as a constituent.
Can the two of you please get a Bible .. you are on the wrong side of God at this time in history;  Wrong Side ..
Thank you again!
Has anybody ever told you you were sexy when you talked about slapping?
