1) Please remember that you can't actually make treaties with other nations.
2) This is one of the dumbest things you've done as gov.
You are effectively dictating the business policies of private companies. Is that your idea of limited govt? It's not your job!
I don't recall voting for this; how can you say it represents Texas values when you haven't asked? Cos I disagree strenuously with this B.S.
If companies can express political views (Citizens United), the govt shouldn't censure them for it. That privilege belongs to consumers.
Next thing you'll be saying it's untexan to speak critically of Israel's policies. Why don't you respect #FreeSpeech, Governor?
Proud to promote #BDS in Texas and elsewhere.
Haha Uthman, you're not the governor
I appreciate the reminder, Azi. I also invite you to participate in #BDS, a non-violent, financial means to ending the illegal occupation.
@PremierBradWall I still want Anti-Israel policies to be Anti-Saskatchewan policies.
Thank you sir!
KEEP IT STRONG Our GR8 GOV ABBOTT!!! We LOVVVVE you!
Bless u SIR.
Chapter 29 of Jeremiah is his â€œletter from Jerusalem," which foretells the return of the Jewish people from exile.
If you boycott Israel; Texas boycotts you! #StandWithIsrael #Jerusalem #MAGA
Thank you 
Anti-LGBTQ, anti-Muslim, anti-Hispanic, anti-black, anti-woman, et.al, policies are also anti-Texas policies, Governor.
#StartLookingForAJob
Greg God give you a second chance to be a human being and you are wasting it with hate and bigotry. You will walk into hell one day.
GD bless Texas!
Wow, multiple Tweets about Israel. I'm not anti-Israel, but you aren't POTUS, Greg. You're only a governor.
But he's getting in the swing of things and doing what he was elected to do
No, he's all about centralizing power where he is. #PettyLord Greg playing power games with Texans' lives
Texas shore got thar shit together!
#TexasLeadstheWay
A Texas sized Thank YOU @GovAbbott and all those in the Great State of Texas
Speak for your own damn self.
Channel your anger
What anger?
Moral AND kind! :) Well done!
Israel is not our friend Govenor #rememberUSSLiberty
Why is there Christian imagery in Texas courtrooms? To make me, a Texas Jew, feel unwelcome? Your jihad against free speech concerns me.
I will be more than happy to link a CNN documentary on the life of orthodox who are about 25% of population and control gov agencies

You don't speak for Texans @GovAbbott. Ask us what we think. There is a difference between being neutral and being Anti-Israel
Stop the propaganda. Stop forcing Texans into all of these federal/international issues! #txlege
Remember: You were elected to govern the great state of Texas, and not the federal government.
We are a state that has always been strong because our people advocate for the best interests of our people, and not the federal government
Well, if your people could actually win an election then maybe things would be done your way
You might ask your sinful buddy in the White House why he is kissing Hamas's ass? This is just for votes, you only care for bible wavers
Please keep on ignoring the antisemites around Mr Governor. We're proud of you 
Move to Israel
SCREW ISRAEL!!
Thanks to our outstanding Governor for standing with Israel!
Oh, get it, Greggo!! Your pander knows no bounds!!!!! cha-ching!!
Way to go @GovAbbott ! Israel is our closest ally & after the antisemitic Obama yrs, it's refreshing 2 see our Leaders Standing Up Again!
Thank you Texas!
Thank you!!

@BWSchank 
Thank-you Sir!
Thank you Gov.Greg Abbott Trade and business  bring people togheter - BDS bring wars and Racism and hate
Thank you Gov. Abbott for expressing the views of so many Texans.
The American Empire is more corrupt than the Ottoman Empire...
Your country's interests should be first, governor!
Thank you very much gov , good job I hope the other state going to learn from you
Thank you govener abbott!
Thank you Gov! God bless Israel May Grace & Peace be multiplied to you and the great State of Texas
This is for all of your support Israel
There's nothing special about Israel. An accident of history.
The most disloyal thing a Texas governor has ever written. Foreign policy is NOT your job. Demagogues use free speech to become tyrants.
Wow! I actually had you pegged as one of the smart ones, and an America Firster at that! Never too old to admit when youre wrong.
You do realize that people in ETX still need tons of help after the devastating tornadoes right? How about you focus on TEXANS for once.
Thanks for being my Governor!
That's great, I just wish the POTUS had not dropped cruse missiles on our other ally in the fight against ISIS, namely, Syria.
You do realize that BOTH sides of that conflict hate our guts and want us dead.
Thanks governor for standing strong for Israel. ..may God bless you
you are a pair of money grabbing grifters - what about Korea?Treason in WH, dirty air and water for Texans,Trump and Mercer money bought you
You need to go over and straighten out the terrorist supporting profs and students on UT campus
Governor, this one I just don't get - unless it's politicking. Please tell me how Israel has any kind of strategic interest for Texas.
You must be a product of your poorly-funded Texas public schools with that sort of geographical mastery... Your pander knows no bounds.
Thank you Governor Abbott!  You make me proud to be a Texan!
GREG, NEVER LET UP, GET THIS TRASH OUT OF TEXAS
Bless you, Gov.   All others should do the same.
Time for a change, when you're dictating and suppressing American freedoms. Feel free to waste your time, but quit wasting tax money
Oh lord, they're taking over .-.
@SenTedCruz  Yes anti Israel is anti Texas. Thank u 4 honoring God's nation, Israel.i buy Israeli products from time to time
fascists unite!
My man
Israel should take Syrian and Somali refugees. Show us what a great friend they are.
Don't mention to the Jews that you think they're all going to hell, okay?
So is boycotting Texan goods illegal too?
@SenTedCruz amen and anti America as well !!
@tedcruz
@RandPaul 

That is not our fight. Stay out. 
Let Ismael and Issac fight amongst themselves.
My Gov. Is the Best Gov. In the country!  Thank you Gov. Abbott!
I support Israel but let the world know how orthodox don't believe in woman rights, man don't work while women work for them
If Texas stands with Israel maybe we can also stand for the people that call this great state home too, holding them accountable is a must.
We must work together to keep this state great!
That is actually just incorrect.
I'm really sorry to agree. I am woke to our roles in the eyes of Judea.
