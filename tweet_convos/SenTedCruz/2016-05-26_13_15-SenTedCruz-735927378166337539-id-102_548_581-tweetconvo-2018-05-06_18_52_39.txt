U.S. insurers seek big premium boosts http://on.wsj.com/1WUyZxv 
Thank you for standing with 'We the People', Sir! My son can't afford health ins, must pay penalty $80 per mo w/no ins! #GRRR!
Time to get on board with Trump!  I voted for you, but now it's trump to bash dems
@WSJ where is the GOP plan senator? It is easy to criticize.... Shame on you
Yes Ted, #Trump's been saying that for months. He will enable us to cross state line for best premiums. #VoteTrump #AmericaFirst
Bernie Sanders is really Darth Sidious! I mean throw on a black cloak and keep pointing that bony finger at America! Sith Master
MT @filampatriot RT @SenTedCruz
Texans are just learning how #Obamacare will harm them in 2017 with premium hikes closing in on 60%. #FullRepeal https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/735634574189993984 …
When will we learn who the chosen 1300+ exemptions that #Obamacare handed out to cronies?  It's not #LittleSistersOfThePoor
Darth Bernious (Bernie Sanders)
That is exactly why single payer system is necessary now!
@MissingReagan @WSJ @louiseradnofsky Understand by now Obamacare was designed to fail 4 Govt.Singlepayer $ & control?POWER!
@WSJ GET THIS REPEALED SENATOR CRUZ
@WSJ anything to hurt the poor and fight healthcare for other Americans, why do u hate americans and want children to suffer?
@Karee_news Yep, and Gov. Abbott just took payola from Trump to not investigate Trump U! @SickCult!  Shame on Abbot!!!!
And your aiding in the election of Clinton? Somehow I feel you really do not care!
Disingenuous BULLSHIT, @SenTedCruz! Tell us how you'd replace Obamacare instead of pissing and moaning about it.
when are all Americans going to get a h/C policy like the one Congress has?
@SpeakerRyan and enjoy ur f'n 2 week vacay - do nothing jerks

Congress health care for ALL
@Mariacka Too many ppl wait until they're already destroyed B4 they see what ppl have been showing them for years.
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky Yes, but they can keep their Doctors if they want to...I mean, maybe they can. Ends justify the means=Dems
@WSJ Taking America back calls for impeachment of Obama & co and trying them for High Treason
Glad @SenTedCruz is going to rewrite it and make healthcare more affordable. @WSJ @louiseradnofsky
TY. I hope to @RestoreHistory accuracy. My archive on #Obamacare is a Full page of bookmarks.
I support a #single payer health system. #Stop for profit greed
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky numbers wrong. 60 from bush era maybe. But 17 million kids pay nothing. Don't forget that lying Ted.
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky Ted, stop this nonsense. The Affordable Care Act has more Americans insured, than at any time in history.
Donald Trump will repeal & replace Obama care w the help of Dr Ben Carson. Time to stop being a baby & endorce DJT
@vmpcott @WSJ @louiseradnofsky Was known long ago Ocare would implode when #Obama term ended...no surprise
@WSJ hopefully they will be voting you out...and you can enjoy working
@WSJ yes, fullRepeal of that obama fee,  (tax),  enough said. @dxrpi ,i fb shared the infograph bullet points,  thx.
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky @DanScavino @TexansTrump how can we trust you LYIN' Ted #cruzmistresscrisis
You know these are private companies, right? It is the market that is driving up the prices. Because Jesus.
@WSJ That's why we need Independence from the US Government.  @TexasNatMov #Texit
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky  Trump! Never say Never Again, Senator. Open Mouth Insert Foot!
Obama Care is laughable, how can a poor rated person like Obama be a 2 time president That honor should be for the extraordinary
@BarackObama will go out of office on a springboard. #millennials #independent #tcot
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky Senator how is this so,have you not been communicating to your constituents?
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky funny how you can't read the article without a subscription.
@MamaBear4Cruz @WSJ @louiseradnofsky
@SherriQuinn9 @SenTedCruz @WSJ @louiseradnofsky
thank you Democrats.
That's why Big, & Ruthless private insurance companies must be taken out of the equation. Screwing Americans for years!  GO SPS!
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky  Barry will just place blame on global warming, the NRA, Bush and an incompetent TelePrompTer technician.
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky Oh you mean the Wealthier folks.  Why no Medicaid expansion?
Ted, help get it repealed.
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky You mean the private insurance companies that provide health insurance to people!!!
#youlie Seems less about #ObamaCare more about  Business as usual for the insurance industry . #gop #dnc #POTUS
I have a novel idea, Ted.  Why don't we try Free Trade in health care instead of managed trade via 50 state agencies?  Hmmmm?
@WSJ The bastards should want to get rid of the mess they made, pass it on,and would except for the millions HILLARY will make.
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky - full repeal of Obamacare, then what? HSAs? $6k tax credit? No good choice for un/under-employed or poor.
please go back to Canada now. @WSJ @louiseradnofsky
@WSJ 400 a month to 900 a month single male 2000 yearly deductible to 5000 for dr. 5000 for Hospital
@WSJ just now learning this California found out two years ago Personal Insurance single male PPO 400 a month to 900 a month
:This is exactly what Americans were saying years ago would happen, before our "representatives" ignored us and voted for it.
@WSJ let's screw them 100%, no insurance = death for many
And what Congress members do we have to thank for this? John Bonehead maybe?
Lying Ted Cruz Lyin' about #Obamacare @SenTedCruz @foxnews @gop
@tedcruz @JohnKasich  Why haven't you two sore losers congratulated Mr. Trump on going over 1237 yet?
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky 
this is outrageous. It’s more than our mortgage already. If it keeps going up... Ugh. #RepealObamacare
60% increase?!?! We already pay $1149 a month (family of 4) & all medical bills until we hit the deductible (6400 I /12700 F)
"Just learning" where have u been Cruz? This is old news!
Cruzer TXNS you speak of? Cuz, real TXNS been ON IT and more!! No mo of my $ unless you pay yourself to sit up there!
How can OB admin get away w building TransGen facilities for illegal aliens?  1 already in Texas.  Why?
@WSJ Obamacare rip off the unaffordable scam! Obama perpetuated - do you still trust him?
You prefer that taxpayers foot the entire bill for the uninsured & uninsurable (with no cost sharing) as it was BEFORE the ACA?
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky only rich people need health care!!!  Poor people should just drink water
.@SenTedCruz man, shame Texas screwed over Texans and denied Medicaid expansion and Fed resources that would have helped with premium hikes
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky Lets hear your plan. Oh wait. You can't come up with anything until Obamacare has been removed.
@WSJ this must be what happens when you pass legislation with reading it. Washington is a joke they should all be thrown in jail
@WSJ @louiseradnofsky Please make me relevant again
#Obamacare #FullRepeal and #DoNotReplace as is not in keeping with the #Constitution.
@ElsarioD @SenTedCruz @WSJ  It's not About Coverage It's About CONTROL 
@WSJ Please Senator Cruz continue standing in the gap for the citizens of the US and fighting against govt overreach.
would be NICE you to congratulate  @realDonaldTrump  for acheiving the 1237 delegates!  Thank you!
@WSJ
not true
@WSJ it will be gone soon.
@SenTedCruz
O hell yeah!!!!
yeah that won't happen now that you won't be our next POTUS! #FullRepeal #Obamacare
@WSJ Ted!
you need to get behind Trump and ask your supporters to do the same.  Please don't split.
Obamacare... The "I told you so" that never ends.
God bless you Ted....You still play an important role in defending the Constitution. Thank you for your service.
America voted for him twice. I'm afraid for our future.
Wonder if Pres Obama will use #Obamacare when he leave office?
Obama and Politicians are EXEMPT from ObamaCare. It is how Polosi got it passed.
