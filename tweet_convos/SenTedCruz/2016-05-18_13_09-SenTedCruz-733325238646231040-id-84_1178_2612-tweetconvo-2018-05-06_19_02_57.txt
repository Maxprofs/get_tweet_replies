@KatMcKinley The liberal medias had a plan to beat Trump and Spirit of Republican party http://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/05/18/music-will-change-rapper-trump/ … it's true Foxnews
Every city should do this. Imagine a city or country without law enforcement. Prayers to all in blue.
Good. Some people who deserve acknowledgement finally.
Very good, I appreciate that good luck
GO BLUE!

Thanks to all
Don't tell this to @HillaryClinton or @BarackObama They really don't honor the brave policemen! Just saying! GOD bless the police!
Dallas lights up red for the taxpayers National taxpayers week pick up your paychecks donate to the hungry buy somebody a burger
there's no honor in this country for law enforcement you get a paycheck move on if you volunteer that's a different story
man The Omni is a great place
wish all the larger cities would do this! Good going Dallas!
Yay Dallas!  Best downtown in the country.
I commend Dallas for honoring its policeman. They protect this big city of Dallas And they are often targets. Lord protect them too
honor them for what picking up your paycheck we all do that program for putting us in jail and shooting us they are paid
if you're going to insult our police force at least make sense when you do it.
God bless the men in blue
is Bernie's black lives matters protesters going to be there?
