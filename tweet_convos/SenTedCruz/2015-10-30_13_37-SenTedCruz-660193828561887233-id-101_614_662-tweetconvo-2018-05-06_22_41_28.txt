@andreajmarkley There is an old saying: Poor folks have poor ways.Hard work& using resources wisely is the way to avoid being poor.
@andreajmarkley Lol !  People that truly need help I'm all for, but you can't make me believe that almost 50% of people need help.
@andreajmarkley Most everyone has to struggle,there are no free lunches. I applaud anyone that makes it,but they owe us nothing!
@andreajmarkley @wkirkm The house slaves always believe their master's lies. They believe the field slaves desire their lot in life.
@SenTedCruz 
Stop whining about every thing. Be a Teddy. not a Lil whiny Rafael.

@ARegisteredRep @SenTedCruz The Media is solely responsible for diluting the minds of weak ass liberals.
@crimsontide2262 @SenTedCruz half the country is liberal. If a candidate can't talk to Press without throwing a hiss then we need new cndidt
@ARegisteredRep @SenTedCruz No, we need a new half of the country that gives a damn about the whole country.
@crimsontide2262 @wkirkm @ARegisteredRep @SenTedCruz & contributes something to it as well!
@jasonsmook all for a Trump/Cruz ticket

@SenTedCruz The problem with statement senator is that liberals cannot think for themselves and have to spoon fed by the party.
@mapenergyllc1 Oh l agree, thats why l am a Trump man. Time to run all the liars our of Washington. Won't leave a soul in that city!

@SenTedCruz Great debate and thank you for shoving it down the media's throat.We are all sick and tired of being sick and tired of them.
@SenTedCruz is this why you lie to your constituents so much? #politifactfail
@SenTedCruz Hence the "dumbing down" in public school SHEEP FACTORIES by liberal "educators".

@SenTedCruz ONLY JESUS CAN SATISFY YOUR SOUL! "For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness." -Psalm 107:9
@SenTedCruz Thank you for the "general" knowledge you provide us with.

@SenTedCruz cry babies
@SenTedCruz #prosecuteplannedparenthood  #endobamacare #balancethebudget #beaconservative

@SenTedCruz Adams was too smart to fall for your Carny Act.  You and your fraud of a father.
@SenTedCruz i know Enough To NOT Vote For You
@SenTedCruz @ArmorCavSpin.  It takes one to know one. Keep up the good work. We're behind you.
.@SenTedCruz  Why the fuck would you quote a STATIST like John Adams??  John Adams can kiss my ass!!
@ChristianCalls1 @SenTedCruz John Adams was critical to the creation of our nation.
@BlackrobePrecha  John Adams was a piece of shit. The Barack Obama of his day.
@ChristianCalls1 Don't know the source of your history but it doesn't jive w any history book I've ever read. Whatever
@BlackrobePrecha  Alien and Sedition Acts, hello??
@ChristianCalls1 No politician or party is perfect. Neither are all laws pure but that was the exception not the rule of his governing.
@BlackrobePrecha  Like I said earlier John Adams was a piece of shit; ZERO respect for the 1st Amendment. *SAM* Adams was 100% the opposite.
@SenTedCruz “This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.” - John Adams
@SenTedCruz Great Job in what ever that was on CNBC. It sure wasn't a debate. Thanks for all you do. It's clear to see you are a sheepdog
@SenTedCruz @jjauthor  Do you ever watch  "Waters World"? The general public has no clue about nearly anything.
@SenTedCruz @jjauthor If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. 
~  John Q Adams
@SenTedCruz @prfekrdumbrella
- @BarackObama @CandyCrowley and @CNN should be prosecuted for conspiracy and election tampering
