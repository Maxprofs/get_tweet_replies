He knows he is Toast, he just wanted Money and a Last FU to Trump, he is over , done with ,OUTY

If I were #TedCruz, I would slip away quietly and disappear. He will be blamed if #Trump loses to #HillaryForPrison.

Sen Cruz, why are local banks disadvantaged, as opposed to the money center banks, because of DoddFrank?
@SenTedCruz
Consummation cost of buying a home have increased & will
continue for the consumer because of the regulations
Negligible Benefit @SenTedCruz
WOW - UR name is flying all over wikileaks' threads - you asked the dnc to fund U - WOW - you thought you were safe with hillary
Meet the real @SenTedCruz #LyinTed 
 @FreeBeacon
No surprise.
The bigger man would forgive and move on whether apology was given or not
he said put aside anger and forgive. Unite to win in November.
This morning he was asked who was he going to vote for?he didn't answer the question.Is he a Democrat?
his wife's company gave A LOT OF MONEY TO HILLARY
A christian that cant forgive, a man who cant honor a pledge, is a man who cant b trusted

@SenTedCruz
you are insignificant
you support #HillarysAmerica !! Despicable
@FreeBeacon so, you're voting for Hillary now?
@FreeBeacon 
U R FINISHED!
U CAN'T PUT AMERICA 1ST! 
WE WILL NEVER FORGET THE 2016 CONVENTION, EVER!
thank you for courageously standing up to Mr. Trump senator.  You have a backbone which is more than I can say for the GOP
The name itself #DoddFrank, tells of the corruption and stealing of America by big govt progressives
How could you sell out like that?  I used to support you.  You basically told voters to vote for Hillary at the convention.
@SenTedCruz
@FreeBeacon #DoddFrank American people? You mean the wealthy & corporations, to hell with the 99% right?
Thanks @realDonaldTrump for exposing @SenTedCruz as another wolf in sheeps clothing.  His career is over
Disappointed 
Its not about you.  Americans can't be under Hillary's reign. It's about us not you
What don't you understand about Hillary?
One day I would have voted for you, NEVER!
maybe your next job, bank teller
leaked emails prove you are working with the #DNC
where R the pictures of you and heidi celebrating at this historic and momentous event - you should have them plastered on here
where are all the pictures of you delivering your speech at the convention - the most important in front of the biggest crowd
gutless performance at RNC. Embarrassing!
You are part of the problem sir....
so disappointed in you at the RNC!  I will never vote for you in the future! You are wolf in sheep clothing!
you committed political suicide
I liked you as a possible future president, not anymore Lyin Ted
My mother said it  is better to sit in silence and let people think your an Idiot than open your mouthand remove all doubt
With Trump continuing to attack you, maybe you can continue to be on the forefront to continue to distract him.
i guess ur political career is over. U threw it.

@FreeBeacon great speach, sorry you didn't try to unite the GOP, end up with Hiiiery
Happy to pay my $310 to prevent another Wall Street/big Corporate Bank "grab" of my middle class meager assets
I was your supporter before you came on stage and failed to  endorse the Republican party. Pathetic and immature.
u won't have a problem Goldman sacs
- very disappointed in your behavior. Short sighted. Sorry I supported you in the Oklahoma Primary.
Ted gives Wall St what they want
We have our nominee like it or not for the sake of the country join us defeat @Hillary
@FreeBeacon U were 1 of three that I liked of the first candidates but U R like Hillary put yourself before the American people
U 2 the public saying that Ben Carson dropped out so U can get his votes & release provocative photo of trumps wife
you made it personal first and you got what you deserved The the people saw right through your lies
you're lucky he did not expose your infidelity like The Inquirer did I don't know how your wife stays with you
The letter of  Master of America to Pence
How do you expect to defeat Dodd - Frank when Your behavior helps HRC. I have lost all respect for you!

I thought you were smart,I was a supporter of yours,you really screwed up!!
Local banks AND Fed should be taxed. Congress take back print. money and manage it.  Flat tax and shut down IRS. Get to work
@FreeBeacon no Cruz respect anymore for us.
We voted for you in 2012.  You won't be getting that support in 2018.  We'd vote for a Democrat before we voted for you again.
America First!  Not Ted First.
@FreeBeacon You blew it Cruz! So disappointed in u after last night! I liked u once but now #nevercruz
We must get rid of the politicians who make deals with the devil. Politicians who are not looking out for the people they work4
ted the TURD we need to vote you OUT
why don't you support @GovGaryJohnson #TeamGov if you are not supporting @realDonaldTrump ?
Understand being hurt and bitter, but you are an idiot for not putting US(A) ahead of U
Yet how many Veterans are still dying waiting to see a doc or be admitted while you cater to illegal aliens TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz ?
you should have endorsed #TrumpPence16 Who could ever listen to a word you say now? Pathetic!
@FreeBeacon Boo hoo, servile lackey, Ted Cruz, is crying over his corporate masters again! Cruz putting money over the Lord!
I once supported you..
@SenTedCruz
After this message I'll stop following you. I will NEVER vote for you. You can eat green eggs and ham now. #RNCinCLE
crashing the economy with de-regulation hurts everyone especially working class Americans
Go back to Canada and stay there! Take your sad sack dad the traitor commie with you too. I am just speaking my conscience.
sore loser. Lost respect for you.  Was t the time. U should have stayed home!
and big banks kill businesses with red tape and ever-changing requirements. #KYCisBS
Bad speech last night. You are right about many things Dodd Frank/Unaffordable Care Act but should have been classy you weren't.
I respected the position you took last night.  It takes a person of conviction to be able to do that.
@JohnKasich time to pony up and endorse. A man is only as good as his word! #EndorseTrump
no one is interested in what you have to say,anymore. You ended your political future.
u messed up Cruz
that's okay. Trump wants to nationalize the banks anyway. Trump banks & TRUMPcare. #doom
big supporter until last night, good buy Ted
Keep up the good work sir.
apply pay to the rescue
you thoroughly disappointed me last night. Trump wasn't my first choice but he was America's choice.
not to mention the BS legit people have to go through to buy a house anymore, thanks dems
Trump calls em as he sees em. Lyin' Ted. U serve yourself + u proved it last night

You went after Trumps wife first. I did not forget. You started it but you could not handle when it comes back to you.
Go back to your dog house Ted. You are yesterday's news!
Support, not endorse Trump.  For yourself and everyone!
Don't ever talk about GOD, you're just a another Liar. Christians forgive and forget and move on.u turned your back on Americans
#LyinTed
Hey Ted The next time the GOP needs toilet paper, you can roll out.
Not a man of your word..blew it with most Americans, then you leave and go ask for donations. LOL It's over for you!
