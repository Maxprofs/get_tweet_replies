@SenTedCruz CIA sez "some will get through" Boston Bomber Brothers "got through" look how well that turned out
@eoin2899 @SenTedCruz they were brought here from Russia as very small children. Grew up in US.
@Lesperado1 @SenTedCruz See Book "The Brothers" plus they retn'd should not have been admitted in the 1st place
@eoin2899 @Lesperado1 @SenTedCruz Why? They were young boys.
@Lesperado1 @SenTedCruz read Gessen Book "The Brothers" unlike Feds she WENT there and knocked on doors-asked questions
@SenTedCruz That's why we already have that in place, you fundamendalist loon
@_LucidHurricane @RiskyLiberal did you read the article??
@_LucidHurricane I find people who resort to name calling do so because they (you) are unable to add anything intelligent to the debate.
@SenTedCruz somehow people will twist this statement into "Im Ted Cruz and I'm a racist'
@SenTedCruz @Amyloukingery you tell them Ted,
@SenTedCruz You encourage The same weapons that American Terrorists use? Thanks for feeding your delusions to a delusional man. People died.
@SenTedCruz Don't forget you lit the match for a person in the US to kill- no different than Isis. Fundamentalist lies & rhetoric kill.
@SenTedCruz so we should register every Christian and maybe have them carry special ID's . Hey did your mother fill out the papers ?
@SenTedCruz @ChgocadChic Obama is betraying America White Black Brown Yellow Red he dosent care until he destroys our country. Impeach him
@SenTedCruz too late, you're already here.
@SenTedCruz "When it comes to dictators, US should mind its own business."
When it comes to women's health, mind UR own business, not ours.
@SenTedCruz  it seems reckless 2 not protect our country & our constitution & b of r's from a prez who is usurping it & sellin out to UN.
@SenTedCruz You mean like your fellow christian terrorist's killing people at PP? Ted, you are the laughing stock of the country.
@SenTedCruz Is this also downright reckless? #hypocrite

#ColoradoSprings
@SenTedCruz The terrorists are here. Y'all purport to be Christian. But your primary agenda is power for "your own kind" over others.
@SenTedCruz what about natural born citizens who commit mass shootings and acts of domestic terrorism like in colorado?
@SenTedCruz it is a sin not to help war refugees. Wld you stay & raise your family here?
@SenTedCruz Obviously a weak border. You made it in.
@SenTedCruz Would that be White Male Extremist Fundamentalist Christians with guns? Sir they have infiltrated us under your command?
.@SenTedCruz Since 40% undocumented persons flew here in visas, let's shut down our airports!!
@SenTedCruz You've been trying to lead using fear and terror. It is best to instead Lead by Inspiration and Hope, Ted.
No @SenTedCruz, respectfully you're wrong. It would not be reckless, it would be #Treasonous! #NoMoreMuslims! @Sweetpea593
@SenTedCruz which we already do!!! So why lie like we don't
@SenTedCruz I wonder what Joe McCarthy (your doppelgänger!) would've thought about your dad the Cuban revolutionary infiltrating the US.
@SenTedCruz @58163 - Speaking of current events ... *crickets* ... I guess the Conservatron 19k88 is out of dino juice. ďøəşņøťçø//půťə
@SenTedCruz - If only we could somehow protect ourselves against domestic terrorists who are already here ... hmm ... what do you propose?
.@SenTedCruz Except for Christian terrorists, right?
@SenTedCruz You're here so I guess it's too late to stop the threat of lunatic infiltration.
@SenTedCruz the lefts radical religion of political correctness endangers themselves and us..the true jihadists are western liberals
@SenTedCruz @NewYorker what is your plan to fight radical christianity & christian terrorism like the recent attack on @PPact ?
@SenTedCruz By Reagan Standards @GOP is RECKLESS - You have LAID OFF more than 80,000 from ARMY alone during 2014-2015.
@SenTedCruz You are shortlisted for my vote along with Donald and Rand. Every one else is not authentic. Please focus on 19 trillion debt.
@SenTedCruz there here already. Why not make a sweep of the nation forest and get them in camps. Or is that to hard.
@sentedcruz I LOST ALL RESPECT FOR AMERICANS FOR ALLOWING OBAMA TO PUBLICALY THREATEN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO INSULT MOHAMMED
@sentedcruz I TOO WILL NOW LAUGH AT AMERICANS NEXT TIME THER IS A ATTACK ON AMERICANS
@sentedcruz OBAMA publicaly threatened the lives of people who insult Mohammed #freespeach #radical #isis and u guys do nothing
@SenTedCruz what disturbs me most about you is your disdain for the constitution that you claim to protect
It's anti-American not to protect America. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @Elisheva7773 The biggest threat resides in the White House. #Congress you MUST #ImpeachObama
@SenTedCruz According to @AP article, it would reckless to elect a man (you) with less understanding of science than a kindergartner. Ouch.
@SenTedCruz I agree: But in order to be ISIS, we must have less infighting, more teamwork: Work together with Trump, Carson, Paul, etc. /:-D
@SenTedCruz @pikester45 yep
@SenTedCruz @58163 more like insanity

@SenTedCruz thanks senator for the checks and balances we need to keep the country running.
@SenTedCruz  How many Muslim nations are they going through and over to get to U.S.? They'd be much happier "assimilating" there!
@SenTedCruz The Russian way....
@SenTedCruz Normally, I would consider you an expert on the "lunacy", but you are dead wrong to characterize the refugees as terrorists
@SenTedCruz securing the borders from refugee immigration, stop spending money on foreigners, is what is important, spend on Americans!
@SenTedCruz the real threat is the cost of more low income immigrates added to welfare rolls of budget that isn't balanced yet
“@SenTedCruz: It's reckless not to protect America from the threat of terrorist infiltration http://1.usa.gov/1MZkVs7 ” @sethmoulton READ
@SenTedCruz "Thou shall not kill."
@SenTedCruz @mlbpc: Why is Congress not declaring war on ISIS?
@SenTedCruz @KDScioscia Obama funded ISIS. Call him out!
 #Islam's #Subud #messiah #Obama is the enemy within our gates.

@SenTedCruz Says the guy who shook hands with Duggar, despite knowing he is a  sexual predator.
@SenTedCruz you are promoting Islamophobia with your proposal.
@SenTedCruz Liberals using "Christ's teachings" to back up Refugee Immigration&fail to see Christ spoke to individuals not nation's policies

@SenTedCruz @Patriot_MM treason - not RECKLESS - don't change the wording of the oath of office - " protect and defend "
@SenTedCruz That is true but why are 35 Jihadist training camps active in the USA with at least two in Texas? @texasfreedom101
@SenTedCruz These refugees don't pose a threat close to the Kryptonian menace you idolize: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/13/ted-cruz-saves-america-in-this-right-wing-coloring-book.html …
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump President Obama wants American's firearms but has little concern about ISIS & "Refugees"?
@SenTedCruz Obama pushes gun control when a couple of Americans are shot by non Muslims & no concern for ISIS/refugees?
@SenTedCruz i feel the same way about all those commies from Cuba that came here. We need to keep a watch on them too
@SenTedCruz Don't forget @glennbeck & his Vetting Team. Slovakia Loved them and has told other leaders about them. Or don't let em in the US
@SenTedCruz  LOOK AT JAPANS LAWS IN REGARD TO MUSLIMS. LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES LAWS THAT DONT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MUSULM TERORISM.PROTECT US

@SenTedCruz @MarkRothschild1 Obama would rather live bravely to the latest American so long as his PC Ego is intact
@SenTedCruz Boston bombers were vetted and came out of a Boston mosque. Close that mosque down. It has produced other terrorists.
@SenTedCruz Hey Ted, you dickless bastard, this is the ethnic tracking system that Hitler used on us! You like?

@SenTedCruz what is already being done:  http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/0814_Inherent-Resolve …  #nincompoop
@SenTedCruz calling into question the work of security agencies is serious. It's them who are on the field to protect us not the president.
@SenTedCruz Are you telling us all government agencies under homeland security are not doing their job It's very disturbing are you sure
@SenTedCruz As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get hit in the mouth. Look at the change Hollande has made after this week.
@SenTedCruz Trump16 then Cruz 20. An unstoppable team.
