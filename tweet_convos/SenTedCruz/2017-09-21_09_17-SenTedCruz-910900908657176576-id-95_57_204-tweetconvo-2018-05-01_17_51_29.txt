What about P.R.?





Looking forward to 2024

Trump wants to eliminate the federal program that oversees long-term hurricane relief http://bit.ly/2xiHrjj 
Sen Cruz are you from Montana? Or have you been home in Canada for the past Month or so? Or on a Publicity Tour in Houston?
And yet you still want to cut FEMA and other essential programs that we all need now so immature Trump can have his great military and war.
3 Amigos who only care about the wealthy. Their lies 2 their constituents will destroy lives. Cut healthcare 2 give $ 2 their friends.
Why don't you and your cronies do something useful and get urself wet and help them. Useless, all of yous
I love adding the quote he’ll be remembered for
Saying sorry for ur loss and oh by the way we r going to now take away your ability to afford Hlth Ins by voting 4 repeal/replace death bill

President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
It must be nearing election time for @johncornyn if he is showing up in Texas and acting concerned for the voter.
Man y'all are really loving all of these photo ops. How much are these trips costing taxpayers?
If the ship goes down use Ryan as a life preserver - he's so hollow he floats.
Be sure not to get yr feet wet, Ted, or Trump'll accuse you, yr dad & yr ugly wife of conspiring to bring Harvey. Ryan's hollow-he floats.
@VisitHouston residents demand some of our tax from the rainy day fund $10Billion. Tell them to stop pretending that they care #cnn #msnbc
Are you pointing & laughing at all the poor people you're trying to rip healthcare away from? You're monsters, every one.
If you could go ahead and just get to work without publicizing it, that would be great. Mmmmmkay.

Kochs pledge 400 million to GOP if they repeal Obamacare.

400,000,000 / 32,000,000 lose insurance = $12.50…
Yes, this is the motivation for this horrible bill. Disgraceful! Shame on you for supporting the Graham Cassidy bill.
Vote No on Cassidy Graham...for Texas Work across the aisle...be a Man
Funny how you're begging for socialistic aide now that your state is affected but were a total douche about Sandy #November2018
Three jackasses out havin' a day! Stellar!

Who cares what Ryan does. He should stay put & do his job
LMAO there's a giant penis in the clouds
An army of khaki idiots.
It's a record!!!!!!!!...the most grandstanding/foto-ops of all time by a gestapo-gop member!!!...GO TED GO!!!!!
Hope you take the time to tour the country when millions of Americans die from lack of healthcare if Graham Cassidy passes. You own this.
Impeach or resign
What do you call a flock of deplorables? Shit stain? Blivet? Clown Posse? Les Incompetent? Idiot Pride? Satan's Gaggle Help folks....what?
you guys talk about this since you have such a love fest.
Until the GOP drops this effort to throw people off health insurance, I will be sharing the stories of people who would be hurt. 
How much did that lookie loo photo op cost the taxpayers?
Cruz: Gosh, that cloud looks like a penis being watched by the neighbor. I hope this visit is as quick as Paul Ryans
So, still wanting all the aid money for TX even though you SLEEZES said NO to Sandy aid for NJ. Bunch of two-faced liars and hypocrites!
Surprised you had the extra time. You know, with your busy porn schedule.
Let them know you're taking their healthcare away while they deal with the travesty of #Harvey #noGrahamCassidy #VoteNo
Idiot
Right on
Porno Ted!
WHERE IS ALL THE MEXICO & FOREIGN COUNTRIES AID????
Mexican relief workers were here right after the storm jackass.
Tell them thanks for the support on Sandy. That is sarcasm by the way
Watching another three-waÿ?

Great question, huh? 
Now, tell us a out health care. Trying to tank Houston Med Center institutions? Do you work for TX or Kochs?
HOW'S ABOUT A LITTLE "SOCIALSM" TO DEAL WITH YOUR DISASTER?  OR HAVE IT YOUR WAY AND LET THE "FREE MARKET" JUST TAKE CARE OF IT ALL...
Your fault chose to live in  Flood/Hurricane zone, no one forced you to live there #RaiseInsuranceRates
@SpeakerRyan needs 2 b ousted, along with old mcdonald senate leader its on ur & the rest of republicraps 2 do what America voted 4 @POTUS
Awesome work.
Don't forget to protect the children at home. #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
Funny they didn’t mention you, Ted.
