Mr. @SenTedCruz - How far would you go to get the terrorists, would you use nuclear attacks?
@kudzowt @SenTedCruz That is the point Tony!
@drakestevens @SenTedCruz lol
@SenTedCruz @ElizabethNels0n

@SenTedCruz @EffieGibbons you are clueless
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz I hope you become President. I want a leader that loves America and will have some common sense. And that's conservative!
@SenTedCruz Reagan sold Islam weapons you moron. One of the worst president's ever.
@SenTedCruz  Drop leaflets to the innocents surrounding ISIS leaders w/msg "If you are in the house with ISIS target, get out or be killed"
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz I will help you find the magic wand to do that if you would like! ;)
@SenTedCruz Reagan was a clueless piece of shit, much like yourself, Aunt Ted.  And he cut and run from Beiruit.
@SenTedCruz All this is his fault.
@SenTedCruz You have got it right sir! us folks out here in fly over country are mad as hell and we know who's responsible for USA demise
@SenTedCruz Amen to that.
@SenTedCruz everybody loses if you all dont stop acting like spoiled children looking for mommies attention who ever wins back them .
@SenTedCruz I love this strategy 
#Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz Problem is when the enemy infiltrates
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Regan famous for running away in Middle East.  Odd choice to show his picture.
@SenTedCruz @vhgtms:It never worked in the past nor will it worked in the future...NOW that they can questions the QURAN....
@SenTedCruz never send young Americans to fight without a commit to winning-which may include lots of "collateral damage" winning is job #1
@SenTedCruz But, you guys refuse to acknowledge facts. It's just more #REPUBLICANREVISIONISTHISTORY
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump The only way help is God/Trump2016
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @PoliticoVoice. Funny how you all start to imitate D Trump when your numbers are low. Guess he's not that crazy after all, huh?
@SenTedCruz Love ya - Reagan backed up those words with unprecedented military build up & political will. Your detailed plans? @cmdorsey
@SenTedCruz http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/14/allen-west-declares-obama-an-islamist/ …
@SenTedCruz ANY Greedy Obstructionist Pirate President guarantees that the American people will lose.
@SenTedCruz @1CalifDreamin Coulda swore that's what Øbumbler said in 2008.
@SenTedCruz Cruz Makes it Simple. Cruz voted YES 2 allowing Terrorists, people on Watch lists, and no fly 2 be able 2 buy guns. How Dumb
@SenTedCruz Check it out if you like Conservatives and Politics, with a little bit of healthy lifestyles mixed in. http://rbl.ms/1vVHg3E 
@SenTedCruz you guys know what "strategy" means , right?
@SenTedCruz @SMLBound Funny now Reagan showed anger when attacking communism; Obama shows it when he attacks conservative Americans.
@SenTedCruz How do you propose to do that when you all speak PC to protect yourself  Training camps u r all aware and do nothing
@SenTedCruz wow.  Way to solve it.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz How about instead of pretended to be a former president w/ dementia you try addressing some real issues?
@gentlemanirish @SenTedCruz @littlebytesnews AMERICA
@SenTedCruz YEAP! IT'S THAT SIMPLE.. JUST KEEP ON CRUZZING, AND DON'T EVER FOR GET GOD GLORY.... ITS THAT SIMPLE....
@SenTedCruz Cruz campaign strategy - I win the Presidency
But Senator, how exactly do w---
I WIN THE PRESIDENCY. THAT'S THE STRATEGY.
@SenTedCruz  Islam is an ideology of conquest!! not co-existence outside of death or tax or conversion! Pretty simple
@SenTedCruz @WarriorsHart444 but where is the plan. That is the result of a well thought out plan.
@SenTedCruz @jennajameson radical TERRORISTS terrorism has no religion.
@SenTedCruz But look at Britain and Europe.  USA following same trail to horrors. Obama & Congress weakening our Military services. #tcot
@SenTedCruz @robyynn Carter protected us now you should.
@SenTedCruz @robyynn Then protect us!
@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber ABSOLUTLY ,THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ! J. W
@SenTedCruz   WOW, WE WIN THEY LOSE? REALLY? What, no details? Make it up as you go? We don't need to know, thankfully you'll never be POTUS
@SenTedCruz @jennajameson or it could be so simple it's childish
@SenTedCruz @jennajameson as an American I can't agree with you more. We win, they lose. But my problem is how you define "they".
@SenTedCruz You're not fit to be President You can't be trusted
@SenTedCruz actually #Reagan gave significant training and arms to "radical Islamic" groups during Soviet occupation of Afghanistan #history
@SenTedCruz @jennajameson let's shove them in to the ocean like the budest monks in Burma are doing only a small percentage are left there
@SenTedCruz Tell Barack Obama ... REAL military ACTION works. He should try sometime. ISIS still fully operational? That is ABSURD!
@SenTedCruz who are you talking to?  A 3 year old? Food goes in, poop comes out. We win, they lose. 2 + 2 = 4
@SenTedCruz @Dolly0811 ted cruz us gotal sellout!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
@e_monsendo @SenTedCruz Just like what Reagan said, that's all!! #Trump2016
@SenTedCruz @timbotim62 we stop the incitement we can beat terrorism
.@davidWeissman3 @SenTedCruz My plan: tell them the next terror attack is an act of war & we drop a MOAB on the Kaba'a. Then we get personal
@SenTedCruz @timbotim62 we need to cut the head of the snake which is the Iranian regime a long with Abbas, Hezbollah and ISIS
@SenTedCruz theirs a man with hate/racism bias/hate4christians how ever u wanna call it.in the WH. With many following or in fear.
@SenTedCruz @jennajameson Reagan was the worst president ever.
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad It really is that simple Whatever needs to be done should be done to achieve this #Cruz2016
Our strategy with radical Islamic terrorism should be very simple. We win. They lose. http://1.usa.gov/1Y6eqtA  
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad http://www.allenbwest.com/2015/10/mainstream-media-wont-tell-you-why-sweden-is-now-rape-capital-of-the-west/ …
@SenTedCruz Spot on the data collection! Sounds strong on foreign policy.
@SenTedCruz  ALL SHOW NO GO TEA PARTY TED !!!!!!
@SenTedCruz So what's your plan??
@SenTedCruz How many attacks have to be carried out before we have a formal declaration of war against ISIS?
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis You won what and when? Also where?
@SenTedCruz ISIS is a lie! The only group is NATO's mercenaries that they pay & direct to topple countries!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMrE7L4kak …
@SenTedCruz @catwahler sounds like a good plan to me. Of course, I would like to see them lose in their country. Hope no feelings are hurt
@SenTedCruz Your tweet is now featured on my @RebelMouse  *bump it* http://rbl.ms/1oIBU5X 
@SenTedCruz Yet you show picture of the guy who cut and ran from terror attack, sold weapons to Iran AND Saddam, funded Osama. Tripled debt
@SenTedCruz Why not use your own picture instead of someone who's dead and can't speak for himself? Reagan would join Dole in not voting 4 u
@SenTedCruz ah, that's Obama's strategy
@SenTedCruz that is not a strategy
@SenTedCruz @kinxbitz true. So why do you want to bring 500% more immigrants here on H1b visas http://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=140 …
@SenTedCruz simpleton
@SenTedCruz @pjfahren U.S. CONSTITUTION vs. QUORAN
@jamie10124 @SenTedCruz Um? It best be CONSTITUTION!
@pjfahren @SenTedCruz ...maybe someone should suggest that to Congress - there seems 2 be little interest in supporting it or banning Quoran
@jamie10124 @SenTedCruz I know, I feel same way but there Has to be someone who will support our USA and our Troops and Constitution
@SenTedCruz You got that right! Sharia violates our Constitution! The only way we lose is for incompetent Govt.to be in charge!
@SenTedCruz please come to Fayetteville, NC
@SenTedCruz Does that mean we're going back to Iraq??
@SenTedCruz thank you Ted. Ask Trump for answers!
@SenTedCruz Don't use Reagan's picture. You are no Reagan. If he were your opposing candidate, you'd call him RINO liberal. #OneTermSenator
@SenTedCruz You'd better check the definition of 'strategy'. IDIOT
@SenTedCruz hey then we are done let's celebrate. Your simplicity is disconcerting and disturbing.
@SenTedCruz simple for a simple person, jihad is a problem that has no simple solution other than mass genocide
@SenTedCruz same s trumps strategy! I hope you both run together!! You will beat Hillary Clinton if you run together!! Keep supporting trump
@SenTedCruz How? Violence begets violence. Showing compassion to refugees and the Muslim community would undermine ISIS' purpose/mission.
@SenTedCruz Nice saying. Not a strategy.
@SenTedCruz He sold arms to somebody, they must've been the good ones, he cut and ran after the same ones killed 240 marines, great example
@SenTedCruz as in close the damn door and arrest and if necessary kill those who are in the inside.
@SenTedCruz you guys are looking for a detailed strategy. Which I understand but what do any of you think should be done?
@SenTedCruz Too simple.   Won't make it past Congress unless it is at least 5,000 pages, at which point it is passed to see what is in it.
@SenTedCruz ...the lame-ass libs and RINO'S will never understand that.
@SenTedCruz this statement may be misread. He said the strategy should be very simple. That's what he is saying. He's describing a strategy.
@SenTedCruz That's not a strategy.
@SenTedCruz Then you don't let ANYMORE in and DEPORT TERRORISTS-IN-TRAINING and DON'T GIVE THEM WELFARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenTedCruz the way things ought to be
@SenTedCruz More empty words. And who lost?
@SenTedCruz How dumb does your voting base have to be in order to believe you have such a "very simple" strategy with comments like this?
@SenTedCruz Reagan was awesome. Wish we had him back.
@SenTedCruz tell that to the families of 311 dead marines in Beirut under Reagan watch
@SenTedCruz  as opposed to the current plan of publicly ignoring it, and privately funding it?!
You tell'em @SenTedCruz! Keep ringing that big stupid bell!

#WeWinTheyLose
#CanadiansForCruz 
#Vote4CousinTed 
#TedCruz2016
@SenTedCruz As long as you have a republican establishment and liberals that don't work for the people and with the people you will lose.!!
@SenTedCruz Senator, STOP it. There is no such thing as radical Islam. Islam is Islam. Educate yourself on that!
@SenTedCruz Great, now we can all go home now. Problem solved lol
We win they lose is not a strategy @SenTedCruz. That's a campaign slogan. What is your master plan? Please state. Have a blessed day.
@SenTedCruz yes, #Reagan put it best : We win. They lose. #DefeatISIS and other terror orgs!
@SenTedCruz I think using dead people for promoting your particular ideologies is a fairly lame way to sell your product. Can I get an amen?
@SenTedCruz and people say Trump has no plan. My # 2 pick should get it together.
@sentedcruz   It was a great line when Reagan said it, and it's still 100% applicable today!  Paparazzo Bob
@SenTedCruz THE BO ADMIN is banning syrian CHRISTIANS-why is no one pointing this out
@SenTedCruz 
Step 1: declare victory
Step 2: ????
Step 3: We win
#greatplan
@politicallyme @SenTedCruz Lol, remember this?
@SenTedCruz simple, like you
@SenTedCruz Genius move for Cruz to get that face transplant, the likability tour was DOA, but this may work.
@SenTedCruz @bartmckinley And that's it !
@SenTedCruz Wow, it's like you're the next Napoleon.

@SenTedCruz Strategy:
noun
a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim.

"Winning" is not a strategy
@SenTedCruz Barack Hussein Obama is a Muslim.
@SenTedCruz at what cost, more of our men and woman coming home to no health care
@jasmal @SenTedCruz Nice red herring to toss in there--
@USAlivestrong @SenTedCruz no it is a question, we do not need another war we can not afford.#FeelTheBern
@jasmal @SenTedCruz   You didn't have to feel the bern for me, I already knew you were a propaganda chanter for the UN-
@USAlivestrong @SenTedCruz wow nice name calling there#FeelTheBern
.@jasmal @SenTedCruz  What is your mozlom affiliation and name?
@USAlivestrong @SenTedCruz what are you asking there,
.@jasmal @SenTedCruz Pretty plain, wasn't it? You should know you have no future as a leftist if you don't convert to izlom, right?
