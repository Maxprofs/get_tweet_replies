@rustymason7777 @SenTedCruz Is it Rusty or Redneck?
@rustymason7777 @SenTedCruz and if someone give me the real reason then I'd look seriously at him!
@rustymason7777 thank you for sharing that with me. I knew he was no saint but he was willing to die for his ideals
@rustymason7777 yes you are right.i was a child in the 60s and saw the unnecessary brutality.
@rustymason7777 @SenTedCruz Time to go home bogot
@SenTedCruz please do not mention his name for you sir are a walking contradiction,pinnochio. You don't stand for another MLK did.
@habolocs @SenTedCruz Don't be like that, man. Ted and MLK both stand for what is right. You don't have to be divisive. Stand for good/God
@fullgracentruth @SenTedCruz hope you're being sarcastic lol
@habolocs @SenTedCruz nah man, sorry. I just believe in God's love. Not trying to make you feel bad or anything. I see it in both brothers.
@fullgracentruth @SenTedCruz you have a good mindset and I appreciate that. But his actions speak to no love but ill will.
@habolocs @SenTedCruz Ok, as long as your hearing what he has to say from first person/right from the horse's mouth and not biased sources.
@fullgracentruth @SenTedCruz of course not. Only way I comment is from what he says directly,not a person with best interests for minorities
@habolocs @SenTedCruz  alright, just be sure u keep being open minded, then... Ttyl

@SenTedCruz  you will never fool anyone
@SenTedCruz He may have been fond of Canadians .. not sure. Doubt if he liked liars.
@SenTedCruz  How sad that you have NO idea who the man was and what he stood for.
@SenTedCruz Yes indeed he was, @SenTedCruz ! Too bad the same cannot be said about you.
@SenTedCruz awww. Did someone delete my tweet? Poor wittle Rafael. Waaah. Waaaah.
@SenTedCruz "TED CRUZ SPITS ON MLK AND ALL PILLARS OF FREEDOM WITH HIS HOMOPHOBIC HATRED!" - Rev. James Cunningham D.D.
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 @jamesmorandojr mr. King would say that President Obama is a disgrace to his race and to the Country
@SenTedCruz you know Ted  you absolutely correct that's a big if The country ever elected someone like you. In again that's a Big if
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 @jamesmorandojr if mr. King was alive today he would realize that we have no strength and we need Trump
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 @jamesmorandojr things are a lot different now than when Martin Luther King was alive we need trump now
@SenTedCruz Celebrate??  Riots/BLM movement/Cop killings. You really think he would be proud that his work has been demolished!
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 Razz-berries!
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 Not anymore it's not. In today's world the Ultimate Measure of a man is how much he obeys his wife without complaining
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 Didn't your father HELP Fidel Castro??
@SenTedCruz Yet we no longer commemorate America's first president. Still riles me. @peddoc63
@SenTedCruz The truth is that you're nothing like him #DemocraticSocialism
@SenTedCruz wow! Hate is such a strong word but I guess it gets thrown around like the word love.
@SenTedCruz phony Ted Cruz. U r a LIAR   http://www.nationalreview.com/article/214989/right-stuff-ted-cruz …
@SenTedCruz Amén hermanó! Gracias.
@SenTedCruz You wouldn't know it with all the riots that have happened in black communities
@SenTedCruz hypocrite
@SenTedCruz ,, Don't try the appeasement to sway Black voters ! You hate Blacks like you hate taxes !
@SenTedCruz how fucking dare you
@SenTedCruz #RestoreTheVRA
@SenTedCruz he was anti poverty Ted! Are you? He believed in the equal redistribution of wealth! Do you?
@SenTedCruz Ick! Why bother insulting us, your hypocrisy knows no bounds #cubanadian - not eligible to be President!
@SenTedCruz He wasn't Canadian.
@sentedcruz happy martin Luther king day.
@SenTedCruz That's what separates you Ted from EVERY other candidate.  You need to point this out more often.
@SenTedCruz why hasn't #McConnell brought to a vote the House Bill Revoking Passports of citizens fighting/training with ISIS?
@SenTedCruz and you and your supporters would have had him pick cotton if given the chance
@SenTedCruz @TerriGreenUSA ...especially when King was carrying on w/different women other than his wife.
@EileenJael @SenTedCruz @TerriGreenUSA that's irrelevant. He had more character in his little fingers than you/Ted have in your whole body
@SenTedCruz  Thanks Ted. Well spoken.
.@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz a truth you work hard destroy
@junglejack1 You know the senator had a much shorter nose last week.  @MonsterMarcia @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz hmm I don't think King would've been to fond of you
@SenTedCruz I think Dr. King would be appalled at BLM
@SenTedCruz Two qualities you lack: courage & dedication to truth.
. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz A truth you fight to destroy and still struggle to understand.
@SenTedCruz celebrating #MLK today. Every other day advocates huge cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, etc. #texas #arpx
.@SenTedCruz #ReclaimMLK
.@nealcarter @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz psst you're the kind of person he was working against.
@SenTedCruz Save all of us the irony that is your entire candidacy.
https://goo.gl/bRrIiu  Now @SenTedCruz, rank 2 taken by Ted Cruz of GOP field recent day hyped on Twitter #cruzcrew
@SenTedCruz What about the 14th Amendment? Obama had a Hawaiian Birth Certificate, what have you got!  Bernie and Hillary are comming to you
@SenTedCruz Funny I don't recall him calling asking the people to kill cops and things were much worse.
@SenTedCruz on a personal note sir, keep up the good work and fight on. I appreciate the way you are campaining.
@SenTedCruz @JackBlaine3 Great Christian Leader, staunch republican. Loved God, moved the world in the right direction. Died for his beliefs
@jlspokesjr @SenTedCruz @JackBlaine3 no he died because a stupid white fuck killed him
@SenTedCruz so we get the VRA back then?  he would not have liked you either.
@SenTedCruz 
Yet you want to decimate the Voting Rights Act. How dare you commemorate King.
@SenTedCruz he is rolling over in his grave over the incompetence of the first biracial president
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz  #Hypocrisy
@SenTedCruz Watch out for lightning strikes there Senator. That level of hypocrisy begs for it. #MLKDay
@SenTedCruz in the debate last night that said"MLK" said "transform America". He never said that!  Obama said that!
@SenTedCruz Your staff did a great job on the meme. It's one of my favorite quotes, but we all recognize #Hypocrisy Your #ActionsSpeakLouder
@SenTedCruz Congress Funds #PP with $500 MILLION , #WHY does @HillaryClinton Get $20 MILLION,#GIVEITBACK,#Should Congress STEP IN & ClawBack
@SenTedCruz Standing up for every person's rights is everyone's job. Speak with kind and just words of reasoning.
@SenTedCruz May his courage & non violent thought serve to eliminate the current rebellion on law & order.
@SenTedCruz Wait aren't you Canadian?
@SenTedCruz I guess you agree with Dr King's leftist ideologies? You should probably vote for @BernieSanders
@SenTedCruz If alive today, Dr. King would have been actively campaigning against you.
@SenTedCruz didn't know Canadians celebrated MLK day
@SenTedCruz As US leaders became puppets and kites the nation succumbed
@SenTedCruz You should be ashamed of yourself. Dr. King would have vigorously opposed your policies.
@SenTedCruz Interesting, didn't think Canadiens celebrated MLK day.
@SenTedCruz  what about John F Kennedy he helped Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
@SenTedCruz Something you could learn
@SenTedCruz FYI: #MLK favored democratic #socialism
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz, the voice of minorities, LOL
@SenTedCruz In that case, U need to quit w/ the tea party crap. U have contributed to the GOP regressing.
@dxrpi @SenTedCruz Well, you're quite a bad person.
@dxrpi No arguments here.
@SenTedCruz can somebody explain why we are giving Iran another 1.7 billion this is taxpayers money correct?
@gwlydick You are not. It was a loan.
@leftnotracks @gwlydick not a loan. It's Iranian money in international banks that we locked them out of.
@nifkinjuice Easy now. I don’t think Rev. King had much hate in him. But 50 years ago Cruz would have hated King. No doubt.
@nifkinjuice No shit. Hence my use of the conditional “would have”.
