This "who supports Israel" narrative is so played out. No on ereally cares.
there's no 'narrative'. Israel is the only nation state in that region with a clue n they need support from the world
The world should never support the actions of a country that is oppressing another culture. Power needs to be used responsibly.
Stop! Israel is not oppressing any state unless a state of insanity. People move freely until a murderer lashes out.
Tell that the family of this Pakistani who was killed by your solder for no good reason.
Justice even when Palestinian knife attack suspect was attempting to kill. Israeli military court convicted soldier.
Your tweet says it all. No matter what the facts are...you will defend a wrondoing because the defendant is Jewish
don't use the term facts pal. Nothing is more nauseating than a lib conflating the term facts with ideology
yeah, even though they approved 38 billion in aid, (the largest to any country in history)
yep

but they aren't offended about that 38 billion huh
the Indians weren't offended when they got money.
that was before they got stabbed in the back as well.
in the back?, we can't disagree with Israel?...get the hell outta here
I wish @tedcruz would know when to shut the hell up What good comes from going on TV and saying this crap?
Bcuz those in R gov't schools since 1950 werent taught factual history  &TC speaks truth 2 so we dont repeat wrongs.
Factual history? Check aid to Israel under Obama - Huge. TC says Netanyahu that'd be fine. He F'd up.
Little O shipped huge cash load to dear friends in Iran. Why, anti Israel & USA.
Try again;  Money to Iran was their own money previously on lock down in US.
should have stayed locked down. When do you give a weapon to a thug who wants to kill
Oh Ted. You couldn't stand up for your wife or yourself. But Israel is easy enough
Even I want to take offense your insult. Senator Crazy has stood before Congress & Supreme Court as fighter.
A fighter? An uncompromising drag ass is still a drag ass that WE pay to do a job that he didn't do.
TED CRUZ is 100% correct. Obama and Kerry, for different personal reasons. Two acting out. Very sad.
and what do you think of the coziness between Trump and Putin???
What do I think? Is that your question? Putin / Trump?
that's my question yes
Judgment is very near. New rules of engagement means kick ass time!
does the NBA let men and women share the same bathrooms at their games since they moved out nc do to hb2
 First Kerry engineers the #IranDeal. Now he says, "moving US embassy to Jerusalem will set off an explosion"  @FoxNews @tedcruz @netanyahu
history is going to record @tedcruz as the zodiac killer
Ouch! Are you sure he lived in SF Bay Area?
How forgiving you TC supporters are to forget the post 9/11Israeli spies in USA. http://www.rense.com/general31/fnews.htm …
You are not consistant with your thoughts
Enemies ? Yes lying Ted we always send our enemies 36 Billion dollars and missile sheild defense systems
the plane load of cash to Iran offset Israel's support. Overlooked that minor trip :)
or Tillerson dealing with Iran when sanction were in place and against the law
History will remember you as a zilch who read Green Eggs and Ham.
Who gives a damn. Zilch means nothing so you must be looking at your reflection. Why nonsense?
Hi-oh!
way to kick AL Frankenstein's ass today.
Senator must add and enemies of America! Releasing these ruthless terrorist proves that point. It will hurt America big.
OBAMA IS THE ENEMY OF AMERICA AND ISRAEL.
Yeah & Cruz will be remembered for lying to get elected president. How judgmental can you get?@FoxNews @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider
It's sad how Rep can show more favor 2 Putin than their willingness to wk with Obama. Its all about his Race! B honest!
honest??OK your full of moosepoop..
Be also concerned as to how all of you will go down in history. There will be many chapters to record!
they are demonic enemies of Israel
Not to mention "enemies of the USA!!
Obama will also be noted as the man who damn near destroyed America. He can be so proud! 
NOT!! Lol
you lost to Trump. Eat a bag of Dicks
@gailtalk @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider o
yep
and every other country that is our ally
they're ALSO relentless enemies of the U.S.!!
Why is anyone surprised? Didn't anyone LISTEN to his campaign speeches in 2008?
Of that there is no doubt!
and the GOP will be recorded as traitors.
@docmurdock @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider :Yes sir. And Scripture teaches what God does to enemies of Israel!
oh ted, you're such a fool.Keep a low profile & with a bit of luck your descendants may be able to show their face in 2078
Very True!!
Ted Cruz now in the news trying to re-enter the good graces of the new administration. We don't trust you Ted.Not anymore
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider 
Bull!
Now that is true.
well said Senator Cruz!
to bad nether fox news of idiot Cruz have a clue!
@SenTedCruz , Jan 20th! We must pray & plead w/ our gov., & allies to stand with US & Israel & Not Kerry & Obama!!
the world doesn't like Netanyahu not Israel. They also don't want settlements.
,for peace, not at expense of Israel demise. Mount to stay w/Israel.Palestinians have 2 goals, world domination of Islam & kill Jews.
we need to stay out of other countries let them handle their own problems .
so let it be written, because it is true, thanks Ted.
.@FoxNews .@tedcruz's religious fanaticism is just going to reinforce that of his Islamist counterparts.
And you are a relentless enemy of humanity
Largest defense package ever given to Israel by Obama admin. This is their /your way to say thank you (?)
Thank you, Red, for caring so much about Israel.
Liar. Reread those Commandments you true believer.
God is keenly aware of what they've done too.
No Ted, history isn't going to be written by you right-wing nut-jobs. It will be written by historians.
History is going to record"LYING TED" as the only GOP candidate to lie himself out of the nomination. Just think, Honest Ted could be PEOTUS
OK there gone soon .time to get back to work .
Make ENGLISH  officaly Our National language. 
Obummer is against all infidels. He's a Muslim. Hello? Wake up world.
Research it, you'll realize that's not the case. Shouldn't you have hung yourself in your garage by now?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider good. It's about time someone stood up to them for their atrocities.
.@FoxNews @tedcruz right now we should all focus on stopping the relentless enemies of women, LGBT & middle class—@realDonaldTrump & @GOP
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider Yes History will among their things...
A faint historical record of the odious @SenTedCruz @tedcruz failed challenge to rapey @realDonaldTrump may remain.
Why is Israel so important? And who the fuck cares about what you think?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @FoxNewsInsider Great news about defunding U.N. and its agencies. Order them to pay their parking tickets.
@SenTedCruz Why shouldn't they believe that have they proven otherwise? Israel is epitome of what we should be Strong ally & smart!
and @tedcruz will always be remembered as the guy who could not defend his wife or his own father from attacks from Trump. Coward.
History will record you as the Zodiac Killer. Google your name Ted it's pretty funny.
Biggest part of history was BHzero protecting isis & MSM
protecting BHzero,Europe & Mideast turmoil all on BHzero.
come work for us with trump.. we need your voice
Yes, and at his appointed time God will reveal their mistake as they reap what they have sown against His people.
.@FoxNews @tedcruz Maybe. For sure History will record nothing about #NaySay Teddy.
i'm not just Israel America to
true
Clearly, Obama favors countries without borders.
you left us with Donald Trump
