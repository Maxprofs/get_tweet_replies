that's why the USA training the Iranian militias in Iraq and supporting them with weapon?
what kind of terrorists does iran support? you've no idea what ur talking about!
Hezbollah and Hamas are not international terrorist groups who were named by US. they are not terrorists at all.
We stand alongside russia! and Trump will be overthrown! there's no doubt about it you commie!
@coinabs u r rocking it just like we knew u would. Keep doing your thing
What is your stance on KSA, Mme.Ambassador?Financing of sunni terrorist org., exporting Wahhabism all around, bombing Yemen
Reinstate the sanctions against IRAN ASAP!
Thank you Amb. Haley for standing against the world's formost State Sponsor of Terror: #IslamicState of #Iran
Why is Saudi Arabia always over overlooked for that title?
Mam we in India does not need US intervntn betwn India n Pak.If at all u want to do something than put  pressure on Pak  to arrest terrorist
And what about your sponsorship of Israel , that's ok is it ???
charity begins at home- how about addressing the violent acts by Americans against Americans and immigrants here on US soil?
well you don't have to look to far from your backyard. The whole world knows the US is the biggest!
lmao!
What about Pukistan?

what about Saudi Arabia? And what about domestic terrorism like mass shootings? Are you going to stand firm against the NRA?
u libs now own domestic terrorism since an attempt was made 2stop it. NRA has nothing to do with it.
you are much more likely to die from the hands of a gun owning American Citizen than you are an Iranian...
that isn't the fault of NRA or the gun. That is the fault of a human being who has little value for human life.
how much money do you think the NRA has to lobby politicians to repeal laws which keep guns from the mentally ill
laws don't stop people from getting gun. Chicago strictest gun laws in country. How is that working out for them.
how easy it is to cross state lines to buy a gun in a state with less strict laws? The laws must be Federal
Constitution states "shall not be impeded". Libs could care less about gun violence. They don't want any1 owning
Reply to @nikkihaley Where is Ted Cruz??  
Iraq? Yemen? Libya? Lebanon? Syria? Vietnam? Colombia? Panama? Honduras? do i need to say more? #hypocrite
what do you know about it "Nothing" you probably never served in the armed forces. Your just a crybaby Obamanite
always same words but no action!
We should not be helping to empty the middle east to europe or USA just so Israel can biblical land grab.
Could your good office put sanctions against those Asian nations that have much dog-skinning (alive), dog-caging, & dog-beating?
.@nikkihaley @coinabs U should stop practicing hypocrisy at some point in life. Still in bed w/ KSA & keep funding Pakistan? Stop that 1st.
and those countries that have Trump hotels too, right?
You know the EO list was Obama era legislation referenced in the order. @nikkihaley
yes. You know POTUS has the ability to modify the list.
It shoots the idea about Trump hotels out of the water if it's not his list; I despise the man but your lies even more. @nikkihaley

So #ISIS attacks Europe & US b/c of Israel:
Israel as #SanBernardino #terrorism motivation as well:
Israel as #AQAP #terrorism motivation to include 4 #UnderwearBomber:
CIA's Mike Scheuer on #terrorism motivation also ignored by US media

You on drugs?

@FranTownsend 
# Iran has a horrible human rights record. Not in any position to preach to the world about human rights.
Stop Ukraines from attacking it's own citizens. Just bcuz they speak bi lingual & Russian doesn't make them Russian invaders!!!
WE sponsored it in Ukraine and why West Ukraine shells Donbass in the East Ukraine! This is WHY our news is fake. GO there! SEE!
@drdeebabedi what about pakistan
Sugest it to senator McCain first. There're plenty photos of him with notorious terrorist & mass murderers.
@TheMeemStreams We stand together.
How about the UN? State sponsor of terrorism right on the Hudson River.
And sponsors of terrorism like Russia to Ukraine Georgia and Moldova. Isn't it?
@TheMeemStreams 
I knew I liked you and now I know why. Remember that a conservative is a liberal with experience!
Rhetoric on its own merits is never really that impressive. I would suggest studying Iran's last 30 years before such statements
That's really not easy, knowing about the Clinton- Foundation, which sponsored Syrian rebels,who fight together with terrorists.
But the US won't stand up for intl law, intl justice and human rights. US will defend #SaudiArabia, #Russia and #Israel.
Are you ever going to quit wearing that fake Chanel Suit??? Should be thread bare by now. #haleynostyle #haleyunqualified
BUt we support/armed terrorist in Libya & Syria, & help Saudi Wahabbi terrorist shooting cluster bombs on children in Yemen.
"kakie vashi dokozatelsva?"(c) u have the evidence, don't u?
Iran? How about starting with Saudi Arabia, your ally. Would be easy: stop selling them arms!!!
iran vs ISIS
.@nikkihaley Does that include #Saudi #Qatar & #Turkey? NEVER end til US confronts ALL that support & fund terrorist orgs. #SalafiMovement
people accusing Iran ( over Israel) for international crimes must be idiots or bigots?
Israel is actually the terrorist state. Settlements are war crimes. Iran needs nukes for protection. Iraq, Libya were victims.
what about the killings within US, like a fresh case of Indian killing in Kansas ?
Nikki, darling, how does exactly Iran sponsor terrorism?? On irrelevant topic, israel and Saudi are ok, @nikkihaley?
The US won't hesitate to stand against the forces of terrorism, that includes standing against states that sponsor it, like Iran. 
currently Iran fighting terrorism in Syria but Saudi sponsors it
USA largest state sponsor of terrorism since WWII
like Saudi Arabia?
@YousefAlNaimi we hope that factually
Nikki is so courageous for calling out the @UN for its anti Israel stance while ignoring true atrocities in Syria & North Korea
Why did the minister say then that all sanctions were lifted the other day for the jcpoa and 37 experts saidt theyve compled??
Says the woman of a country who brought all in this area in war+ helped to fund the f...... isis human trash for their war games
we highly appreciate your stand and we need further actions rather verbal expressions
What about Saudi Arabia who funded 911 and ISIS, evil warmongering hypocrite. You're no better than McCain and Clinton. #WW3
You are a marvelous choice to represent us at the UN. I always admired you as South Carolina's governor. You make us proud!
Stay True to Your Word.
Stand we will!
But the US will hesitate to stand up against a corrupt and brutal oligarchy like ours?  Thank you.  -- Vlad

@gunnettep oh you mean we don't have a president who gives billions to Iran???Obama, the Muslim sympathizer .
right on!
.@nikkihaley 

How about #SaudiArabia the motherland of terrorists & ignorance as opposed to #Iran the best educated country in the region?
.@nikkihaley @nilo84 USA needs to come clean on Carter’s CIA backing of the terrorist IRI. Won’t have any justice standing on a LIE.
please come back, or run for president, either one is cool with me
except KLA terorists and ISIS, them u can support cuz they arent terorists they're freedom fighters...u can't be that unaware...
it would be about time!

back the US.  The average US citizen has know idea the actions or current players here
In many counttries,  people feel that the USA is the ultimate terrorist nation.
when will the US stand against the biggest state supporter of terrorism, Saudi Arabia?
e Iranian regime's top export has always been terrorism, it is an integral part of its ideology!
Speak for USA, you work in the most corrupt/Inefficient Org in the world! Be the light/salt in your environment! Be strong/true!
: Nikki you said great stuff about the UN thanks for sticking up for Israel.  The middle East is against them.
you are a puppet for apartheid Israel #BlameIran
exactly right.
And the #Assad regime.
Nikki! Fantastic Job!  Proud of you!
But the U.S will stand with Israel and their 77  UN Resolutions for acts of War Crimes & Human Rights violations. Hypocrisy.
you didn't mention Saudi Arabia
Stand up gal. Stand up President. What has the world come to? Thanks for the service!!!
Way to go, Ms. Haley!
finally
Stay strong Ambassador! Thank you for your service. Knew you would be great!
I'm sorry, did she serve in the military??
She didn't. It was a sarcastic remark.
