@TruthSoldierz I'd love  to take a handful you into, Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, or Tijuana while the drug cartels are at it..
Yep I agree. I live on the Texas border. Juarez cartel is in El Paso torturing the border patrol.  Certain areas of EP are too dangerous.
Can you tell me when that happened because I live in El Paso TX  and what you just said is BS
if you don't think El Paso is filled with crime spilling over from Mexico you're insane..
Where are the facts that crime era torturing the border patrol  and yes I think crime is ispilling in to US
BPA Brian Terry,  DEA KiKi Camarena
Camarena was an undercover in Mexico got caught and kill
naw he was a station agent not under cover.. We have DEA field offices all over Mexico
But trump...

Are you seriously retweeting Breitbart?
Has anyone bashing Breitbart ever read it or are you basing your opinion on what you've heard?
Yup read it. Annndd...it's crap.
@tedcruz um, this is a fake news source
And this is according to a fake American!
nothing but a sad troll
Right on glad to see senator Cruz helping us American people the best he can thank you senator Cruz (Mark)
And the new AG is?
Anymore..I would almost welcome REVOLUTION or Cival War...scrape off all the crap, start over...and brietbart...partisan? What is she crazy?

Confused since Heidi Cruz is the author of the open borders bill to allow for fully open borders with Mexico/USA/Canada/S America
IT IS ABOUT TIME !

We are now taking a second look at Cruz...
You are a fan of Breitbart I see
Lose Cruz 2018.  Only 468 more days.
Vote for Beto. Vote Cruz out!!
Advocate? He is working night and day for the rich in Texas not the people in Texas! Where were the agents when he came across?
He's absolutely my advocate!
Bwwwahhhahahahaahaaaa. Breitbart Texas
Not taking click bait for #Buttfart. Cruz should not try to legitimize these alt-right (wrong) clowns
@SenTedCruz @BreitbartNews advocate for TRUMP NOT constituents SO SAD TED @indivisibletxjc @indtx36 @MSNBC @PoliticalDiscor
Funny... you seem to have missed this article during the election. 
We need to build a wall..around Ted's chunky soup eating face.
Take Texas back from the Cubans and give it to the Mexicans!
ALRIGHT TED. GOOD JOB..
He's got you fooled.
@SenTedCruz @BreitbartNews  Poor border patrol agents. They deserve better than they've been getting. You can help them TED
Ted is a puppet for the Koch brothers
Beats being a trumpeteer
Vote NO on #TrumpcareKills bill! Vote NO on #TrumpcareKills bill! Vote NO on #TrumpcareKills bill! Vote NO on #Trumpcare bill! @JohnCornyn
@SenTedCruz that's a bad thing from my perspective all he more reason to resist and revolt
@SenTedCruz @BreitbartNews 
Sen.Ted Cruz is a coward. Hasn't stood up to insane president. Chose party over country. SHAME!
No he isn't, sez another, canceling them out and causing them both to implode
Now that's a fake news source!!! I would imagine our senator would be wiser.
Rafael Cruz is quite possibly the worst thing that could have ever happened to Texas or the USA. He should have stayed in Calgary!
Cruz and Trump are wonderful, says some random racist law enforcement guy. And my crazy neighbor. And Farenthold & Gohmert. Me? Not so much!
Without geting ice arests up by 3x-5x, ilegals will continue to flow in undeterred. If not through border, they wil overstay visas. @ICEgov
I must know what you style your hair with. Is it the tears of infants? Sweat from migrant workers? Trump's ball sweat?
No he's not
Bb news what bullshit.

Thank goodness someone is consistent on this Issue
You look really cool in those glasses!!

Ted Cruz is our advocate say political hacks.
@tedcruz is a propagandist ... it's as simple as that. And indicative of why he thinks @BreitbartNews has any credibility lol!! #losecruz

Breitbart, Nazi-like propaganda. Nice, Senator.

Thank you Senator Cruz. Liberals have no idea.
There is a crazy person in the White House.
Ted Cruz doesn't advocate for anyone unless they write him a big check. He can't be trusted. 2018!
Yes. One agent speaks for all Americans. Up yours.
