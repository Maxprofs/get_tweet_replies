@pikester45 Who cares... half the country was trying to get him to step down for months.
Well ur pretty nice/not. Decency escapes you
Wasn't trying to be. The man tried everything he could think of to skew the process. Possibly still is
Donald Trump will NEVER & Ever measure even close to the  principled Great Conservative Ted Cruz.
No probably not... he would have to fall a long ways to arrive at that point.
Actually everything Trump says is maluable. Trojan Trump changes ideas with the wind. Zero principles
While I agree with you on some of that point and find it as irritating you. Cruz is as bad.
I don't accept any premise Cruz is bad.Cruz is T/only 1 for the Constitution.He's defended it as well
How long dumber been n office& just now addressing? He's not n office, does not have authority. Liar/cheater, put b4 ethics bd
Trumpkins crying bc conservatives not sup their stinko candidate. LOL Will lose BIG.
@tedcruz is this the same Ted Cruz that emphatically stated that he would endorse the republican nominee? Well- what say you?
@Gas8128 Where was this #Cruz during the campaign??The guy who brilliantly defended Constitution,w/o agonizing pol talking pts
@tedcruz Fellow Texan Senator Cruz. As a Navy vet I thought the Disney remark would have got him out immediamente.
@CloseTheVA I agree, he said the dumbest thing that was and is offensive. Lack of respect for military men,women and veterans
He sent me an email at 5AM this week. He really honors the vets.Really, no really.
it was probably a robo email
Or, we will find him soon on a highway drunk. He is heavy into cover up and smile this past week. No substance.
... Thanks Mr. Cruz! You ran A Great Campaign!
Cruz is for our Veterans & Our Country :-) Trump is for himself and steals from the Vets
There are so many reasons to vote 4 Ted Cruz in the General & this is just 1 important reason. I'm still voting Cruz
The only person I trust anymore is someone who has been consistent in his (cont) http://tl.gd/nmebem 
@silverbird458 Thank you, TED Cruz!!
@tedcruz I agree with that but it doesn't fix the problem do something about it
@tedcruz : oops! Ted's bucking for another job!?
@PatVPeters Back in reality. Cruz should stop using Vets for pub . Campaign dropout.
No doubt. Apologize bc he has no respect?Not good enough for that position he has
TrusTed to Lie @tedcruz is calling for action, but our Veterans need Healthcare Vouchers Now not later! Why Not now Lucifer ted?
@tedcruz  good idea Mr. Cruz  let see if you are as good as you have said your are.  Get the Senators with you
@Dlw20161950 can we not do the same with Trump
@tedcruz Ted needs to just go home n become a house husband. Ain't good for much else
@tedcruz Yes.
@SenTedCruz Wow, that's THE only thing smart I have heard from you!!! Trump. Trump, ONLY TRUMP!!!
@DrSueDVM   too late.
@JHolmsted a little late to the party retarTED.
@SenTedCruz and country would like you to step down...  pay us back for shutdown!!!
@tedcruz while everyone else calls for him to step down
oh go away ted
@tedcruz What. The. Fuck. Is that picture?
@ChuckNellis Send Old Nob McDonald back to the farm.
@tedcruz @sentedcruz should resign for being a #failure as senator & #loser as a candidate for @potus. Now #getoverit #doyourjob
@tedcruz hell yes he needs to resign like yesterday! Thank you senator and future president. 
@tedcruz when I see that creepy fuck near the flag I served to defend it makes me puke into my mouth a bit! Fuck that coward
- absolutly agree with this call.
@tedcruz  To be fair Ted, the entire Obama Ad is criminal and should resign.
@tedcruz LOL, no one gives a fuck what Ted Cruz thinks.
@tedcruz Granted,His comment was regrettable but PASS some LAWS where he can make some true change like firing the BAD employees
@tedcruz an 'also ran' desperately attempting to be relevant and failing miserably....again.
@tedcruz the VA should be completely privatized, free of civil service regs
Nacho Norberg calls for Ted Cruz to step down
@tedcruz - YOU step down Ted Cruz,,, your BS is 10 Fold worse than the VA Secretary!!!
@tedcruz America has called on Ted Cruz to step down. Please recall that you lost the primary race & dropped out.
wow so bold of teddy
@tedcruz Ted Cruz should step down for paralyzing our government two years ago. #hypocrite
@tedcruz He should resign.  Pitiful representative for VA!
@tedcruz is the conservative superstar we needed. Trump is a liberal, qualifying all his earlier positions. The orange McConnell
Oompa Loompa doopity Don
@tedcruz #Cruz did thank God
Ted's a total failure...vets don't stand a chance now
@tedcruz  Yep - time to stick another "end of your career", mook in a job where he can't work within the pitifully low budget
@SenTedCruz I call for Ted to step down.
@SenTedCruz I dislike what he said...but who the heck is going 2 run things if this guy goes? The vets have suffered enuff.
@SenTedCruz I don't believe a damn thing #LyingTed says.
But you believe the guy who lies each time he opens his mouth. Pathetic
The Funny farm is right where you belong. You will feel much better when you grow up.
Actually, @tedcruz is not "irrelevant" at all, except in the minds of Trumpkins. #Deluded
@tedcruz I can't believe someone that is supposed to be so smart can be so dumb. The VA needs major changes.
when did he lie?
He is eligible! Born through an American birth canal.
@tedcruz Go get em Ted!!!!
@tedcruz McDonald has lost credibility and hasn't been able to resolve problems so he probably should take this opportunity 2go
@tedcruz Wow. I actually agree with Ted Cruz on something. There's a first time for everything I guess.
@tedcruz I still haven't gotten over trump getting the nom and I don't think I ever will.
Sen. Cruz and I agree on that. McDonald is tone deaf and not my kind of tone deaf. He doesn't feel/see/appreciate the problems
