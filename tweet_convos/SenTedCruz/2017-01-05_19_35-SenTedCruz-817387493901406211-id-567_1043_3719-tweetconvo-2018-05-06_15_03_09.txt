The people overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.
This "w/o CA Trump  won" is a moronic argument. W/o rustbelt, Clinton would've won. Point?
...while the population slowly shifted until it reached a tipping point where that no longer
worked. Limiting the number of reps (& therefore electors) puts a ceiling on the ratio of
representatives/electors that does not correspond to any real-life distribution ceiling.
If reps had kept pace w/population as originally intended, we'd have over a thousand by now.
Actually what U saw was 60% of the country voting against the #pussygrabber #sexualpredator @realDonaldTrump .




He's back lying again - - that little Felito Cruz. Incredible Mandate? U are Nuts!  Follow along -
Clinton won vote of the American People;  Trump got Hamilton's answer to not trusting Voters. Slap in Face!
A bit more specificity: only 100,000 votes in three States; determined outcome of Election. Mandate? Hardly!
YES, AMERICA WANTS A RETURN TO VALUES AND TRANSPARENCY.
You know nothing
yeah but it was a conman selling it.
There's no mandate.  He won on a technicality.
is a pitiful joke.
exactly right and that is WHY Trump was elected. GOP, DEMS need to follow the will of the people.
:Especially when the people said no more Ted Cruz.To me that was more important than the people saying we want Donald Trump
The American people or my buddy Vladimir making things happen? Stupendous!
yup, to hell with civil service protections, get rid of the sand baggers & career pols
there is no mandate. Hillary won popular vote by nearly 3million. You need to think about ALL Americans, you boneheads
- did u see Republicans rioting & burning cars & causing disturbance on street corners when we lost to O?
then "patriots"
@HonestlyTrump @tedcruz   Thank u Ted Cruz for stepping up for Pres. Trump & the American ppl We will MAGA again together.
@SenTedCruz @seanhannity @oreillyfactor yes Ted we will get chg with/without you-stop congress inside trading @HispanicsTrump
Incredible Cruz sounds like he won the election rather than Trump!
I agree!
The Cuban is in la la land again. What mandate? President Pussy Grabber loss the popular vote by 3 million.
You mean the Russians said enough is enough with a strong America. We need trump for a weak America to dominate.
why do U kiss his ring teddy..Is he bribing U as he does others??
then when will @tedcruz go away? Build that wall- NOT!
Oh yes, the day wouldn't be complete without a few bleats from the Canadian immigrant.
really?  Are you sure about that?  You have no mandate.
past is by definition behind us, Grandpa, a GOP reminded us that country built on war, everyone thrives, history concurs.
@bodybynance @tedcruz 

Change toward the constitution is what we need. I'm not holding my breath this cycle

@cnstitutionprty
You're bragging about 46%....
Get on board Cuz'.
True but @realDonaldTrump will never "do what we promised." He already leads #TeamWalkBack.
It also said NO to Ted Cruz.
As it turns out it was  a mandate from Russia, but I guess any port in a storm.
Not really sure how he gets a "mandate" from that election. No one liked anyone. #LostSouls
Cruz for Supreme Court ???
obviously enough people have had enough with corruption. Time to stand up for America and the American people.
Wow the Russian trolls jumped on this one didn't they ? Talk about desperate to cling on to a false victory full of Traitors..pathetic
Lmao no mandate more like you need to stop doing Crack.
get out of Texas your an embarrassment!
You are correct but we have jumped from the pan to the fire!
@gailtalk @tedcruz What HiLIARy and OBAMA have done for AMERICA
A military coup is in order.
It's amazing how people can look at '07 and '16 and not recognize how far we've come.I'm not partisan but not blind either
no just enough of you Ted Cruz
barf
Incredible mandate?  He lost by 2.8 million votes
kinda sucking up
Lyin' Ted misspoke. He meant to say the Russian people had enough.
@tedcruzAMEN to that!!!!
@SpeakerRyan Americans start getting used to Putin as your new POTUS @realDonaldTrump will most likely be FLOTUS to Putin!
I agree! The demons kept delegitimizing Trumps victory.
Curious, what drugs warp your brain so much you believe losing the popular vote by 2.8 million votes equals a mandate?
When the mandate comes from being representitive of the states in the republic
Chuckling, were you born that blind to reality, or have you been working on it a while?
I guess you're forgetting that people said enough of you too teddy
stop saying American people. Most of the time you speak for yourself
What we saw on election night was Putin's manipulation of our system. Putin won;  the GOP (you) is giving the US to Putin
@rhoyt1 @tedcruz Amen and Amen!
absolute truth! No more deceit cast upon us!!! Underestimate  the American people...eh? The gig is up! .Drain it!.
Lying TED, the American people gave @HillaryClinton a 3million vote mandate. The electors selected @realDonaldTrump on Dec 19th.
That's right. We the people wanted change and Putin had nothing to do with the election. The just don't get it!
can you read?  Mandate, BS.  3,000,000 can't be wrong.  Lies continue to divide America, you are big contributors.
Despite Paul Ryan
You mean when the Republicans lost the popular vote by almost 3 million? That was an "incredible mandate"??
if by mandate you mean 3m more Americans don't trust GOP lies, then yes
You got that right! Enough PC and protect our own country& citizens for a change !
Yes enough of your tatics and bullshit.
Ted has been talking to Kellyanne. Oh and cheers for bringing that lying, toxic garbage into our world & WH.
We never know which way ur flying Lying Ted Cruz. One way today. Another tomorrow.
people who didn't think that Donald Trump had a chance of winning, under estimated the strength of the American people.
 YEP you got that right pal. We had enough!!!
I don't know whose worse trump or this idiot.
You have fought to hold down the budget. We admire that. Just remember there is lots of fraud. Program cuts not always it!
True.. Done and dusted it's time to go to work.. You got to create more than 11.3 million jobs or half of that in 4 yrs
Mandate?  Really?  Seemed like a squeaker win to me.  Yes, it was a win but I doubt that "Mandate" really applies.
True..but no thanks to you Ted. Your constitutionality is fine but your ego warns of you serving yourself, not the people
he won,  not a mandate when u get crushed in popular vote and more Americans didn't want him, Obama had mandate u blocked
for 2 years Obama and Dems did everything they wanted, GOP couldn't block. Then 2010 happened. Mandate gone.
Give me a break. He has no mandate.  He lost by 3 million votes. More Fake Fox News
less than half of the American people.
# The American people spoke loud and clear by popular vote, DJT was not their choice!
# The meaning of mandate is he WON, by the lowest % pop vote since 1800s, HRC won 3 million more!!
and enough of u ted more than most...
"& we watched a man bend the knee to the person that attacked his family's honor to better his career" he forgot that part
Yeah but no thanks to you traitor!
Mr. Cruz, you are right. I just hope that all you Republicans back Mr. Trump. All need to work together. We have control
Trump barely won & you claim mandate but when @POTUS @BarackObama won convincingly you said he did not have one
Amen! Regular Americans have gotten their county back...the other whiners need to get out of the way!
and nothing will change. Everything The Donald campaigned on won't happen.  Sorry Teddy, you got beat by a dunce
:no mandate at all. Trump won by 100k votes that swung electoral college. Lost popular vote by 2.9 mil. Russians helped too
is propaganda.
&
@tedcruz doesn't believe in concensus, only in dictating.
GOP never were good at math.
@BrotherVet @tedcruz The country voted for Trump
as a Texan, I can honestly say Ã­ lost the little respect i has for this guy after he endorsed trump
Exactly why Hillary lost.
@SenTedCruz , Americans must unite once again for  our allies  on Jan 17 to side with Israel & Us, Not Kerry & Obama !
Duh our allies voted against Israel. They want Netanyahu who is facing criminal charges gone.
, did not know, which allies , tks.,  Jan 17 coming too soon, do u back Israel ?
France Britain Russia China etc. don't like settlements. There is no peace if they're not stopped
, I believe the land belongs to Israel, whomever is pres.Pallestinians: world domination of Islam, & iniliate the Jew , period.
enough job increases? enough healthcare availability? enough auto industry growth? enough stock market gains?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz this should not be "Fox" News.  It should read "Fake" News.  Hannity is the worst spewer of it.  He is a joke.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Any thoughts on the propaganda and disinformation campaign by foreign gov't? What about illegal electors?
I don't always agree with Senator Cruz. But I've always respect & admire his honesty. Well said senator! Well said.
Cruz was right.he didn't mention though that the GOP has run the worst Congress in history. What is it 9% approval rating
no it was the Russians and decades of GOP lies, notably yours. Well done your lack of leadership is a disgrace to the USA.
A minority of voters saying that, you mean
The Minority Elected Precedent lost the popular vote by almost what 3 million and 50 electors are illegit.
So why did he lose by three million voters?
by almost 3 million saying that Hillary was the right choice SHE had the mandate Rafael
2,846,000 people disagree with your assessment, Ted. Is this why US budgets are always screwed up? You guys can't do math?
I sure hope his term limits amendment goes in.  Wash that swamp out on a regular basis.
Again Ted, you're wrong. The almost 3 million vote advantage Clinton got on election night wasn't a mandate.
@AwakeDeborah @tedcruz I like him better now that he isn't running against Trump. He will better serve in the SC.
#thisistruth
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz  u r all the devil.
oh ted. Please just stop with the Trump love.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz This is utter bullshit! Republicans have painted themselves into a corner. Desperately clinging to their lies.
how many times is Cruz going to flip flop...ugh
:and you missed it Ted, and we won't forget!
Sure wish you had been on board sooner.
Now I simply cannot trust your words.
go away
no mandate for @realDonaldTrump or @GOP-@HillaryClinton won 3 million more votes, @SenateDems also millions of more votes
lol can someone explain to this idiot what the word "mandate" means? He's using it wrong. #LyinTed
You mean this mandate? #NotMyPresident
exactly.  tired of politicians
Teddy, you need to go look at the popular vote again Sparkles. #lyingted
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Maybe but the American people voted for someone other than you. You weren't wanted!!!
Exactly why trump lost by 3m votes... We just couldnt convince the 500+ electoral colleagues...
@heavenlyitalian @tedcruz ; Senator Cruz , would you inform Schumer of the news , WE WON 
Lying TED!!
- Wrong.
Fueled by racism and hate.  Non Christian values.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz He should have been out the very next day.
Yes Ted and you failed to participate until after the election. You appear to be a coattail rider now.
Looks like Ted gets it
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Only in your ELECTORAL, mis-guided mind
is he vying for a job? Because he's become extremely passionate about a guy that's humiliated him.
@GovAbbott this is going to go all the way to the Govern's office as well Mr. Abbott come on out on this
@SenTedCruz there was no mandate for change. No matter how many times you say it does not make it true.
Ted I am so proud that u took the high road in all of this; I'll be praying that u get nominated for Supreme Court justice!
CRUZ! U did nothing for the AMERICAN PEOPLE u only weaseled in Tea Party ideals & law that benefits TX prisons
@SenSchumer Did you NOT get the memo? American VOTERS are sick of your BS.
How will address auditing the Fed when 3/5 contributors are large financial institutions?
I think what you saw was winning the election for DJT and Hillary winning the popular vote by almost 3M!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Everyone but California, that is!
@SenTedCruz Cruz has to get his act together and support New Administration or face defeat in his Texas run for Senate
"Incredible mandate" doesn't lose the popular vote by 3 million. @FoxNews @SenTedCruz @tedcruz
You do when they are ILLEGAL. Thank the lord our forefathers were incite full & implemented EC
.@FoxNews .@SenTedCruz .@tedcruz a "mandate" with ~3 million fewer votes...What are you smoking...#Hannity
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz what mandate? You lost seats in senate and congress. Lost popular vote by 3m. GTFOH Kevin!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz yep 2.8 million less of them
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz  Besides P-E Trump & his people, it's about time somebody understands why he has such a rabid following!
YEAH, DON'T FORGET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAID THEY'D HAD ENOUGH IS ENOUGH OF TED CRUZ.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz WORD!
Mandate for change? You need to have a large MAJORITY of voters vote for Trump to b a mandate. He lost by 3million votes.
You're right on one things Mr Cruz. People are fedup with politicians. Republicans didn't won this election. Trump did!
Mandate for change, 54% of the electorate  voted for Hillary Clinton.  What happened to majority rule Ted?
SO TRUE!
by change means more blatant corruption on all levels! the country's citizens will pay!
NO Mandate!! Never My President ,Never,and I'm 70 and have never said that before!!! You are all scary as hell!!
it was a mandate from Americans of all parties. Dems independents n GOP voted for Trump
You will believe that, @tedcruz at your peril. Trump win is not a GOP win and not a mandate in any stretch.
Not!!
Actually it was 3 states that believe low skill manufacturing jobs will come back. Feel for the BS hook line and sinker.
Election Day was a resounding cry of "Uncle" from the middle class. We have had enough from these progressive globalists
really trump lost peoples popular vote by 3 million what mandate Lol
Ted Cruz - more than once - stood on stages along with ppl who think gays should be executed unless they "repent".  FU.
Thank you for continuing to stand up for America and our Christian way of life.
mandate minus 2.8 million
yeah ted, by 46-48% spread. Totally a mandate.
fed up with the do nothing congress
Washington still not listening
You lost by almost 3 million votes. Gerrymandered districts etc...Repubs are losers but great at cheating! #losers #NeverTrump
The only Good Communist,
Is a  Dead Communist.
Revised quote: By a margin of almost 3m voters: "It was the American people saying We Vote For Clinton."
makes him look guilty as hell trying to hide something!
trump keeps trying to avoid or keeps putting off the investigation of the Russians hacking saying lets move on which
was it really the american people or was it really trump and the Russians fixing the election? Hmmm!
pass term limits
Electors decide the winner, but a mandate involves the will of the people. There is no mandate if you lose popular vote.
no it clearly was NOT a mandate.
Losing by 2.8M a mandate?  Jeez, who has parted their moorings here?
lost the popular vote. Lost the popular vote. Get it in your heads and stop lying to your viewers. #notmypresident
Youridiot..weak ass man who can't defend his wife from a bully..there was no mandate he loss by 3millvotes
...perhaps look up the word mandate Ralph?
GOP has no mandate. Dumb
