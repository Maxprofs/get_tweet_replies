.@SenTedCruz @DHSgov Thank you Senator for always doing the right thing for Americans in protection of our Constitution Sovereignty & Safety
He needs to fight against Obama wanting our guns.
.@Camtemp #TedCruz believes in every part of our Constitution esp #2A #1A #5A all of which Dems are trying to eradicate. Why I voted 4 him
I agree Friend. However now we fight for our Freedom.Hillary is a ruthless vile Obama repeat enemy.We must defeat her.
.@Camtemp I agree.  I just don't know if Trump can beat her. His unfavorables are as high as hers & the FBI won't indict I'm sure.
white house n other dept has no respect for Congress. They treat u like u have no power.

question? Did he not know the purpose of the hearing? If so why not prepared!
Did you see the smirk on that lying SOB's face? This is all a joke to them.
@DailyCaller When he was testifying he sounded stupid! How is that, he's college educated?! #BadAtLying ?
Senator Cruz,you are a National hero,only u can get evety American to know who Phil Haney is,u got 2 force the media 2 cover it
Aren't you the dim wit. Cruz defending US from terrorist & you revert to basement dwelling drivel.
The statement? You mean "your still here"? Cruz is a sitting Senator from Texas. Where's he supposed 2 b?
Is there anyone else, wondering how these idiots oops "Incompetent people" keep their jobs? @SenTedCruz @JAmy208 @DHSgov @DailyCaller
No private-sector employer would hire them--or if he did, he'd fire them w/in a week.
@DailyCaller 
LIAR
Rotten to the core!
Senator Cruz,only u can save America from another Dem. term,please u got to force the media to cover this,plz speak at RNC.
Jeh Johnson's cavalier attitude during q&a was disgraceful. In the Reagan era, no civil servant dared behave this way.
your questions to the SHS were extremely relevant and went on answered. It proves the admin has a no strategy.
Senator Cruz, I have much respect for the restraint and courteousness you showed Jeh; he has such contempt for our Laws.
Thank you, Senator Cruz, for shining a light on this.
Johnson needs to be kicked out of the government he is completely unqualified
Sooo Johnson was saying some mid level bureaucrat has the sole authority to scrub government records?
@peddoc63 @DHSgov @DailyCaller This dope hasn't had a clue since he was sworn in! Poster boy for Alzheimer's!
@peddoc63 @DHSgov Liars and idiots!!
@DailyCaller just like everyone in O's administration. ..Liar
.@SenTedCruz Someone so ignorant as @DHSgov only serves to bring damage to our country. His "I know nothing!" is repulsive.
Sec Jeh Johnson response to idiot Cruz is a thumbs up! 
Biggest oversight that was made in U.S. was President Bush not taking seriously all the info he received prior to 9/11.
thanks to hate rhetoric from the likes of Cruz, Trump, right wing extremists are a bigger threat
Assassination of #Christian #Biafra by Islamic Hausa-Fulani. Dictator #MuhammaduBuhari insensitive

@DailyCaller Obama's Orwellian appointees should be investigated for corruption and collusion.
Joe McCarthy, Jr. er Teddy boy, how 'bout doing something useful? The waste cans in the Senate rest rooms need emptying.
@joannesmoot @luckyone6565
what a pompous wise ass. Who the hell does he think he is? My breaks that you're not going to be my president.  bless you.
@DailyCaller Go to convention and get the rest of the delegates!
His flip answers & attitude showed extreme prejudice and disrespect to Sen Cruz & to the topic.  He should resign.
@PatriotGinger @DHSgov Hpw does he have this job if he has "no idea"?! I'd be fired! I'm just saying
why aren't these traitors being arrested? what more is gonna happen 2 US citizens if someone doesn't arrest Obama, Clinton, etc?
@PatriotGinger @DHSgov -Think its time they were all submitted to lie detector tests ,including Hillary
Close DHS. @SenTedCruz @Victoriaokane @DHSgov
@DailyCaller OF COURSE NOT. LIARS
Like Hillary--I'm sire he has NO IDEA what you are talking about.
@DailyCaller Jeh Johnson is as corrupt and inept as his Boss Obama is
..Thank You Senator! 
..outstanding job today 
love you in the Senate kicking the ass of these vile evil delusional hate-filled deceitful people
Sounds like TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz when he talks about Veterans still dying waiting to see a doctor or be admitted 4 treatment.
U should stick to reading Dr. Seuss in the children's world. In the adult world, Jeh Johnson owns you, Rafael Eduardo
Need the other tete now?@SenTedCruz
And @billclinton @LorettaLynch discussed Vince Foster
I think you did a very effective job skewering Johnson today and proving how ineffective the Obama administration is.
I wish you would be Trumps AG.
@DailyCaller
@ldwalters @DHSgov Every Dept of the Obama Admin is Corrupt They R all liars They think Americans R stupid
@ChrisGuster @DHSgov
@rushlimbaugh Comey soon to punt like all the Bush Rinos Rush correct Bush would end the GOP. He gets his wish GOP loses
The level of corruption is unprecedented. Hope and change? The same tired bureaucracy.  Obama is the biggest con artist
@DailyCaller Nice job Senator Cruz! DHS Sec so flipant and disrespectful!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump should watch this video
Awesome! So glad U r calling them out on the BS! Keep fighting for American people's safety!
Politics really? Conspiricy, treasonous. Cant believe someone did this. And they did it no ??? https://counterjihadreport.com/tag/fbi-document-purge/ …
this what you can do best, be the meanest attack Dog for the GOP and the people.
@DailyCaller Nice work Ted. You would make a great VP!
It IS semantics; political ploy to stir up anti-Obama sentiment.
THE LIES ARE SHOCKING!!!  AMERICAN PPL CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE THIS.  HE SHOULD BE FIRED ALONG W/LYNCH!!!
Dog with a bone...do u think DHS agents do media srches (eg) on the terms 'radical Islam' or 'jihadist' 2do their jobs?
@DailyCaller 

Ted Cruz might actually save our Republic despite elections.... 

He is a force.
Johnson is an arrogant dishonest tool!  The oath he swore means nothing to him.  Stand a post or move on Jeh.
your political grandstanding is a waste of time and resources
once again another clueless moron working for "the most transparent administration in history", Secretary Jeh Johnson.
HE is a MUSLIM & BECAUSE of that our Safety is now COMPROMISED along with the WH and DOJ. Thank you for fighting.
Jihad Jeh Johnson is another of Obama's Muslim inner circle like Muslim Brotherhood agents in agencies, CAIR and ISIS.
.@SenTedCruz @DHSgov Ted Cruz - Tearing down America one hearing at a time. Protecting 2A rights of Terrorists who kill our school children.
You do know that the GOP isn't going to choose you next month, right?
@DailyCaller : Obama administration is mostly Muslim and hates America.
Glad to see you back in the game swinging.  Support our nominee help him come around and make a difference u va do it!!
@DailyCaller standard answer for an Obama appointee none of them have any idea about anything
@DailyCaller soooo, dhs is not doing job but collecting check?
@DailyCaller Jeh Johnson isn't very honorable.  It's troubling what this admin. has been allowed to get away with.
I liked how you grilled him. People should be held up to their actions and you did a good job at doing it
@DailyCaller This guy is a one of Barry sorority.  Shame!
again Democrats tell the US Citizens, you dont Matter. #Corrupt @sendems @HillaryClinton @PressSec @POTUS @LorettaLynch
@DailyCaller the main point of this discussion is that DHS secretary has no idea about what's going on. And doesn't care
our government is joke at this point
@DailyCaller we have a bunch of clueless people in Washington DC  that want to run every aspect of our lives
he is full of s
@DailyCaller Are all govt employees braindead & have no clue what goes on around them?  Why are they paid so much?
@DailyCaller Thanks Senator Cruz for taking the lead in bringing attention to government corruption.
@DailyCaller this is so sad that people dodge question. No accountability whatsoever.
he doesn't remember deleting and shredding them

Go tell him Ted
This system has failed.  We need a new one.  Why don't we have a HUMANITY summit.  I'll be happy to chair it.
No idea my arse.
