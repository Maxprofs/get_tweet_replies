@JudyVayssie @SenTedCruz In & out of Iran in less than 24 hours. Talk to the Crew. If boat drifted into Territorial Waters; Iranians clear.
@SenTedCruz Quite stealing Trumps take on things and rewording them to pretend they are your ideas, like jumping on his view of immigration
@SenTedCruz He's smart enough to know that showing hatred toward them is a losing strategy. You want to engage us in endless war?
@SenTedCruz Sorry, Falito; U.S., not going to get sucked into yet a Third War in M/E.; &, if for no other reason than we are Broke - get it?
@SenTedCruz @KennethDurden what's your better idea "Ted" Cruz I'LL WAIT
@SeanMilkshakes ummm how about not giving billions of dollars to a country that's wants us wiped off the planet, that would be a good start
@SenTedCruz I want names of who these American's are. Is this you speaking for Americans. You should have to be able to prove what u say.
@SenTedCruz 
Deny, deny, deny ,then lie some more. O again lectures #US on respecting Islam while denying Isis exists. What planet is he on?
@Akemm2Annette @SenTedCruz The POTUS did no such thing. Sounds like you didn't even watch the SOTU. He talked about ISIS several times.
@BelleDesigns4u @SenTedCruz 
You mean 'Isil'? O has Never uttered the name of
   of #Isis.        Rewind
@Akemm2Annette @TedCruz You probably don't know the difference. POTUS has mentioned both over and over .... Obama Hater.
@SenTedCruz @WashingtonDCTea seems more like he's assisting.
@SenTedCruz  Stop with the gloom. Many ISIS leaders were killed , the city of Ramadi was freed ....Can u say "natural born citizen ?"
@SenTedCruz @JoshuaGivens a) he is b) it's a recruiting tool if you beat your chest about it c) it really doesn't affect us that much
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz be more specific honest & true Ted which American ppl are you referring to? You wld be 1 of the 1s who lead the war agnst Christ
@SenTedCruz bc you don't want to lose your worldly position on this earth, just as the High Priest, Scribes & Pharisees, who also sold out.
@SenTedCruz massive Dissidents are jailed or disappeared in China, what will you do if you are US president?
@SenTedCruz yeah. If he had backbone he'd take a swing at you. Most of the country wants to.
@SenTedCruz American People are tired of having a Party who will not even acknowledge the Evil In-saneness of our Nat'l Debt! Irresponsible!
@SenTedCruz You're Nuts, little Falito (teddy) cruz. Our allies have stepped up; & Iraqi's have grown a pair.  U.S. leds in bombing missions

@SenTedCruz Hello Ted Cruz! You have my vote! I listened to you on Michael Berry's show before & after you were elected. I've dubbed you...
@SenTedCruz Jealous much?!  You'll never get the chance to taste POTUS
@SenTedCruz Just because you make things up does not make it true or believable to the educated people of this country.
@SenTedCruz liar
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad true and we are ferious
@SenTedCruz @wanttruth 'EVIL' is a term used in superstitions/myths and does not app'y to humans. when ppl do bad it's lack of compassion
@wanttruth  the existence of Satan/god is a supernatural belief in my opinion. when ppl dont know what causes something, they call it evil.
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad U can stop him; By telling the #Military 2 #ArrestObama 4 his crimes. #KateSteinle #BrianTerry @BarackObama @POTUS
@SenTedCruz EVIL IN THIS COUNTRY IS LATIN CALLED "ANGLI SAXONES"
@SenTedCruz THEY OR JUST SICK PEOPLE WHAT TO YOU EXCEPT WHAT YOU EXPECT.. I NOTHING LESS..";  )
@SenTedCruz Then Why Does the GOP CONGRESS REFUSE 2 VOTE 2 Authorize Military Force, SILLY CRUZ
@SenTedCruz Or their personal loans secured through their wife
@SenTedCruz If you're prejudice a label make YOU feel better about yourself.
@SenTedCruz Oh he's acknowledged it.He just isn't willing to put YOUR label on it. Labeling doesn't solve anything,unless you're prejudice.

@SenTedCruz Ted "Lets shut the government down" Cruz wants to be POTUS. Are you ready to accept a VP spot with the old #OrangeMonkey?
@SenTedCruz Really? Attack on something remotely true. Obama authorized a killing spree over seas in Iraq + Afghanistan. PURE B.S.
@SenTedCruz and now that u are running u forgot how to tell the truth
@SenTedCruz @dawnmarie1204 but but but it was a good speech...
@SenTedCruz are you serious? Obama has done more that Bush ever managed...
@SenTedCruz It would be unbecoming to point out that a sitting senator is evil.
Did they not play the SOTU for you in Canada? @SenTedCruz
@BenSaunders @SenTedCruz I don't think Canada wants him either!
@SenTedCruz I don't think Obama can correctly pronounce my name.  But don't worry, once elected my name will be on everyone's flappy lips.
Settle buddy, you've lasted 7 years, only 10 months left. You can do it! @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz what the hell are you talking about!! Your talking points are delusional
@SenTedCruz how about you vote to authorize military force then senator. Stop being an ostrich and get your head out of the ground

@SenTedCruz your a candian
@SenTedCruz @SoniaPennell He won't call evil what he sympathizes with. Which in turn makes him evil!!!
@SenTedCruz You really don't know what you're talking about, do you?  #missinginaction
@SenTedCruz but one who abets evil is even worse. http://youtu.be/09sK8d4mzso  I love you but you are wrong
@SenTedCruz on the contrary, I believe the American People are tired of false claims and devisive rhetoric.
.@sentedcruz Well, there's term limits, so technically he *can't* run against you.
@brianwolven @SenTedCruz It is ambiguous whether Obama could run for Vice President, though. 10 year limit, "constitutionally ineligible."
@BadPhysics @brianwolven @SenTedCruz he won't be selected so don't worry.
@OcarinaHero @SenTedCruz AMEN! Cruz has had the chance to work with Obama and be more moderate. No ONE who is a far RW Fringie will win.
@BelleDesigns4u @OcarinaHero @SenTedCruz  little teddy undermines his own Party.  He is the Poster Child of McCain's WACKO Birds & Koch Bros
@SenTedCruz take off you hoser.
@SenTedCruz why were you absent for the "Audit the Fed" vote?
@SenTedCruz did you even listen to the speech? When he called them killers and fanatics who must be destroyed? They print a transcript too.
@SenTedCruz @Brenda5665Y We want Trump!
@SenTedCruz @lukejoh01158045 - That's why we are voting #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
.@SenTedCruz hey, you got a "carpet bomb civilians" nod in the #sotu. Way to go!
@LucyInTheSkybox @SenTedCruz The people in the audience softly chuckled. It was really funny because Cruz is not Presidential material.
@BelleDesigns4u @LucyInTheSkybox @SenTedCruz  little teddy falito cruz is barely eligible to be a Senator; and, not a very good one at that.
@SenTedCruz good thing you'll never be president #tcot
@SenTedCruz make friends with them and sits on our real friends
AMEN @SenTedCruz WE NEED A PRES THAT WILL CALL EVIL BY ITS NAME, KICK ITS ASS, thus I present the #cruzmissile, trusted, always on target
@bakerlarry84 @SenTedCruz Our Military drones & bombs terrorists every single day. The POTUS talked about it in detail. 2 bad u missed it.
@SenTedCruz  Im not tired. I'm loving this prosperity.
@SenTedCruz The POTUS acknowledged terrorism very succinctly. He made fun of ur "carpet bombing" as the USA daily drones terrorists.
@SenTedCruz the American people are tired of you.
@SenTedCruz what?? Did he not kill bin laden?
@SenTedCruz Because ,Obama is part of the evil, he is one of them!
@SenTedCruz why do you just say things that are untrue.  Really sad
@SenTedCruz just another example of Cruz campaigning by laying down an atmosphere -in the words of David Brooks- of apocalyptic fear.
@SenTedCruz you are not eligible to be president
@SenTedCruz "please pay attention to moi". Je suis Canadienne...
@SenTedCruz we're just tired
@SenTedCruz there is always evil in the world dude, why else would the US have the military we have.  Sure as hell not going to over react.

@GammaRae206 @SenTedCruz No, he won't ever be POTUS. Ted Cruz is not eligible to be president http://wpo.st/2uQ31  #CruzNOTEligible
@BelleDesigns4u @GammaRae206 @SenTedCruz  Founders were very specific. Both Parents had to be Born on Amer Soil to prev Brits marrying in!
@SenTedCruz seriously? POTUS acknowledged it constantly, but he's NOT in fear & panic & NOT playing right into their hands, wake up! #SOTU
@TennS4Ever @SenTedCruz Landis, you said that very well. Thanks for being a raitional human being unlike "carpet bomber" Cruz.
@SenTedCruz #PresidentPantload
@SenTedCruz Did YOU get Usama Bin Laden? Did ANY Republican. NO, it was Obama's Call. A tough one from a quiet man. You are a hypocrite
@sentedcruz @TedCruz  The real threat to America is in the White House that will not protect us.  Constitutional Pres.Cruz WILL protect!
@heyjude911 @SenTedCruz @tedcruz  Protect U from what?  What are U so frightened about?  Gees, get a grip girl!
@SenTedCruz  POTUS is delusional, what else is new! As a true Rep, please candidates, stop the infighting. Use civility and stick to issues

.@SenTedCruz Reagan sold arms to Iran and used the money to fund terrorism
@SenTedCruz That's right. Reagan never uttering the word "AIDs" was horrific. Glad you agree!
