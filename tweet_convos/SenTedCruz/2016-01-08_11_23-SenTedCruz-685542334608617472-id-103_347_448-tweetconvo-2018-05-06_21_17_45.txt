@SenTedCruz Spanking Ms. Clinton because she lies? How about you? http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/fact-checking-2016-gop-presidential-candidates/ …
@lifesafeast @SenTedCruz Senator Cruz doesn't hold a candle next to Hillary when it comes to speaking the most LIES.
@BuzzwordHit we don't want @SenTedCruz 's tea party, racist misogyny evangelical hate in the white house.

@AdamWallenta @SenTedCruz Did you get this piece of Left Wing spin crap from the Huffington Post?
@BuzzwordHit @SenTedCruz stupid

@nomoremister @SenTedCruz He came in legally.
By definition, people who pass through the refugee process come in legally, too. @IdaFlo @SenTedCruz
@nomoremister @SenTedCruz But they don't have the same vetting process. Cutting corners could prove to be much more dangerous in this era.
