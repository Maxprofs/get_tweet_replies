@SenTedCruz @MalcusD 

Just what I would expect from RINO @SpeakerRyan
@SenTedCruz @hammetjohn Where was Ted's leadership?? If he can't control his party how can he run the country??
@1Cubbie I've heard some Stupid Statements before but you Show you are a total idiot. You have to be related to Paul Ryan
@hammetjohn Another coward...what are you afraid of?? Loser
@SenTedCruz Are you paying for my health insurance? Or my medication? Also we would need fewer abortions if we taught common sense sex ed
@SenTedCruz un-freaking believable.  Govt of checks and balances has failed.
@SenTedCruz who is watching the dem candidates? Obviously all the libs are focused entirely on you! #libcruzobsession, #TedCruz, #CruzCrew
@SenTedCruz Keep on fighting for the Conservative Cause.
@SenTedCruz 
@marcorubio 
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Do not support this bill.  I am tired of @HouseGOP  and @SenateFloor  acting like Democrats.
@SenTedCruz at least someone admitted it. I certainly don't blame you. We all know better than that
@SenTedCruz limit the power of the Federal Govt as espoused by @krisannehall!  Do you have the fortitude?
@SenTedCruz @DonLaRoche Why is that? Who read this? What a bunch of doo doo behind closed doors. All congress sell outs. We need Trump mind!
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 between the senate and the house you guys can over ride any veto Obama does or don't you know that
@SenTedCruz @RBeus The GOP establishment RINOs have failed us again with this funding bill. They gave Dems everything.  Why vote Republican?
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 Which is why we need a REAL #GOP #POTUS so compromises aren't needed. This is the "Some didn't vote Mormon" bill
@HansDedrich Libtard
@SenTedCruz aaaaaaarrrrrrrgg!!!
@SenTedCruz This really makes me wonder if I can EVER TRUST a Politician again. TED CRUZ is my LAST hope. If that fails..I never vote again.
@SenTedCruz sold out by @SpeakerRyan. I hope when you are President, you put these RINOs in their place.
@SenTedCruz yes, it has become clear ryan is NO different then boehner!
@bakerlarry84 @SenTedCruz

. @SenTedCruz Blaming GOP for Shutting down the government in 2013 led to GOP taking Senate...  oh wait...
@SenTedCruz @MissSelfDefense it's going to be nip and tuck if the USA will exist by the next election!
@SenTedCruz American people sold out again! God Bless Mr. Cruz and Mr.Trump hope we can turn it around.
@SenTedCruz So if the bill is bad, do something.
@SenTedCruz That sounds exactly like what I want! Good job!
@SenTedCruz how is it that an illegal action has any approval chance at all? Perhaps some DC pockets received cash?
@SenTedCruz Perhaps you didn't learn this at Harvard, but politics -- when successful -- often involves compromise. #Basic
@SenTedCruz Most Americans want to keep the ACA, want to fund PP, etc. who are you representing?
@SenTedCruz Yay! But what about carpet bombing and making the sand glow? Does it fund that, too?
@SenTedCruz They are Benedict Arnold
@SenTedCruz don't worry, when the GOP gets the majority, it will be different .....
@SenTedCruz Paul Ryan is no better than Boehner!  It was a mistake for conservatives to support this wolf in sheeps clothing! Backstabber!
@SenTedCruz Didn't expect it to.  No one wanted a fight at holidays before a major election. As a result it was a free for all. So sad.
@SenTedCruz A full press conference on the Traitorous Act the US Congress has done against the country. #DisbandGOP
@SenTedCruz Big gov Rs: hv cake & eat it 2. Really WANT bill but want 2 APPEAR 2b against. Omnibus makes easier 2 claim they had no choice.
@SenTedCruz Awful. When are things going to change?

@SenTedCruz @imsure But it will pass for sure.  Thanks republicans.
@SenTedCruz  the American people get it, that's why you and Trump are leading in the polls.
@SenTedCruz it is disgraceful.
@SenTedCruz   An Elephant doesn't change its stripes, as long as we have senators like you, we will support the Party, but we have limits.
@SenTedCruz Thank You-praying for you. Just sick this morning over horrible news of $ bill passing. Made my calls yesterday. God help us
@SenTedCruz # what the used our government is disgusting
@SenTedCruz The reality is that GOP ideology is a "Leave it to Beaver" fantasy land that isn't sustainable nor based in reality #feelthebern
@SenTedCruz Why is America still funding PlannedParenthood?! God will hold US accountable for EVERYONE of the MURDERS of those babies!!!
@SenTedCruz BT Senador T. Cruz muy bien Pdt Obama #Alerta × INSEGURIDAD sabe escribi × los aquel 11Sep y imagine '''gotas lágri Kiss .

@SenTedCruz It's called a win-win.
@SenTedCruz It's a disgusting betrayal of the American people. The RINOs are selling our children and grandchildren down the river again.
@SenTedCruz let's pop the champagne cork for our GOP sellouts because they did it for us
@SenTedCruz Use your massive influence and stop this then, oh that's right you have no influence, you're too busy running for another job.
@SenTedCruz even looks like Ash Carter shoul resign
@SenTedCruz it's not on you it's on Obama when you get in office there is lots of work to be done. Please help get him out ASAP
@SenTedCruz this is why the common man needs to be in #Congress we could have written the bill in less than 50 pages SMDH
@SenTedCruz thank you for fighting for us! You have my vote!
@SenTedCruz but Ryan says I got something in this deal, I don't sell medical devices and I'm not part of Exxon, so what did I get
@SenTedCruz Stop funding Obama's destructive programs
@SenTedCruz It's a shame Senators like you are in the minority to stop #OmnibusBill
@SenTedCruz i think most of the republicans should run as democrats
@SenTedCruz more accurately, it doesn't honor the promises YOU made to the men and women who elected YOU. Too bad for YOU!
@SenTedCruz Sounds like a good bill to me!
@SenTedCruz #washingtoncartel strikes again
@SenTedCruz and all made possible by the GOP and the Washington cartel which Rubio is a part of so if you like it vote Rubio
@TracySorrell1 @SenTedCruz @SnarkyFieds @TitoJazavac it's called a poison pill and everybody knows what he was doing even Bret
