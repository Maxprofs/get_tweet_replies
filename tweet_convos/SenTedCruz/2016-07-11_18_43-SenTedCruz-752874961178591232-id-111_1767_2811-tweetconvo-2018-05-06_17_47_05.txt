@tedcruz Honoring our Fallen Brothers today...Rest easy Brothers.
Sending live from your neighboring state New Mexico...
so sad :( so sorry :(
I guess the other 155,000 people that also died that day are not important?
God bless each & every one of them & their families!
Any one of them could have killed a black person for no more reason than being black.Everyone is an angel after they die it seems.
@SenTedCruz Corinthians 2/5:8 to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. Now they protect from above.
