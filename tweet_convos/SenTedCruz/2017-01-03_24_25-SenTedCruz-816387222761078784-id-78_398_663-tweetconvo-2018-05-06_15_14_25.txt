These 3 naive senators need a history lesson; this move affects entire Middle East! Backlash will be significant. #DangerousDonald
You need a history lesson too, The Jews were there first. You'd know that if you read about Rome in the First Century.
Yes, I'm very well read on the topic or I would not made the suggestion.
Judaism has existed since 1500 BC as well if recall correctly. Could be wrong.
this is not just about Judaism.  How simple that would be.
However I do bid you Adieu. I don't like to keep convos going on longer than they need too.
@SenTedCruz How much money are you being paid to support this?
There is no compelling reason to do this now but it will anger and radicalize more Muslims. Is that the goal?
But, Islam is a religion of peace. Right?
There is no such thing as a religion of peace. Sorry but they are all FOS.
Long past time to start honoring our allies
well demolition of your old embassy should be cheap, the Jews are pretty good at bombing structures in areas they think are theirs
This will happen!!
WWIII, WWIV, WWV, WWVI...
we done Disney'd it we made too many sequels.
if goes forward, any involved politicians will be personally responsible for the terrorist related deaths that will surely follow.
Because, you know, giving "Palestine," Hamas, etc. an even bigger foothold was beneficial in halting terrorism.
Let's review:  to help Americans, Congress first tried to gut the Ethics committee, failed, and is now trying to aggravate Muslims.
What doesn't aggravate Muslims?
@luvofUSA awesome! Brilliant move, though may stir things up a little.... la chaim
Great news!
Excellent, move it now..
@SenTedCruz how does this further US interests in Middke East?? Anyone asking??
@SenTedCruz 
I'm waiting to see if it really is going to happen
Sounds like a good plan. America needs Stand with Israel to stop the Christian Killings in the Middle East. GOP is right on point.
It's about time.
.@thehill @notiro03 good move a sign of more to come @JewishJournal @NYDiamondFinder @GovMikeHuckabee
this add fuel to a fire!
-- UN First...out of the U.S.!!
@SenTedCruz Good move Ted!  Finally!!! Let's move fast, 4 years is short, hopefully 8 years for Trump!!!
@SenTedCruz good idea. Tel Aviv has a lot of terrorists, jerusalem is heavily protected
@LibyaLiberty Why all of the unnecessary aggression against the Palestinians? This isn't good for Israel either.
This would be a bold courageous move if bilaterally supported. Long overdue. Kudos to the GOP. #Jerusalem
@SenTedCruz 
it's about time they grew a spine!
@SenTedCruz This is great news!!!
The Apocalypse is in sight. 
Stupid bad move
After that, the UN should be moved to Tehran where it belongs.
irresponsible crap
-Moving US Embassy to Jerusalem is huge. Enormously  proper move.Israel is Gods chosen land w/Jerusalem as its capital.
@SenTedCruz  Good idea!
Back up the moving vans. Next stop Jerusalem!!!
Can a list of the roll call vote be published?
@SenTedCruz so you guys were OK with Obama throwing Israel uder the bus to be distroyed by terrorists?
mazel tov..
Let's get this done @SenTedCruz @thehill JUST IN: GOP senators propose bill to move US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem
alarming
@SenTedCruz   Love this!
@SenTedCruz  SHALOM.God is so pleased with this move. Thank you Ted Cruz. Israel is finally getting treated properly as our ally
@SenTedCruz #StandWithIsrael
@SenTedCruz HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH
About damn time...
Now stop talking about it and do it.  Do it today instead of some dumb ethics bill.  We want real change.
The Evangelical GOPers should build it in Megiddo,and avoid the rush when that 2nd Coming comes? lol
And when it's attacked who will they blame w/o Clinton or Obama?
Going to happen now. We can all thank Obama for this. Wouldn't be necessary if he hadn't been throwing a hissy fit.
Better think twice here because it puts an increased defense burden on Israel on top of Obama's reprehensible betrayal.
BUILD THE 3rd TEMPLE...!!!
@GottaLaff awaiting final approval from president of Taiwan. #smh
Not sure how this will help the peace process but then again not sure what our approach to the peace process even is at this point.
@GottaLaff no
This pandering to clueless Fox victims will be the end of us.
@GottaLaff Heck why not move it right in the middle of the Gaza Strip
Right?
MT #GOP 2move embassy" #American tax payers never approved this waste of money put a consulate in #Jerusalem #Shalom @CNN @nbc @ABC
What's next? Moving our national capitol to North Carolina?
nooooo; to Mar-a-Lago.
if this really does come about the Middle East it's gonna blowup.
pretty peaceful now
The "eternal capital"?
AMEN, long overdue.Jerusalem  is & has always been the capital of Israel!FOREVER
Aren't there more pressing issues than appeasing donors and politically protesting the recent UNSC fiasco? Just sayin'
why?
The move should begin at 1pm on 1/20/17. #StandWithIsrael #Jerusalem
Right on!  Drive the bus boys.
they have to prepare for the sudden appearance of characters from ancient fairy tales!
Will that help ?
Or is it just partisan politics ?
