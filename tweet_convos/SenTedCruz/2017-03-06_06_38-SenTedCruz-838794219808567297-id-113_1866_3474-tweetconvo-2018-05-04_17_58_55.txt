Not when it it comes to racism, sexism, misogyny, or xenophobia. Sorry. He's a racist, sexist pig. And a snake oil salesman.

@SenTedCruz Why didn't Texas side with the Confederacy 1861-1865? We could have used it's Army to take down the Yankee Liberals.
Texss had the more soldiers in the confederacy except for Virginia. They were the best Calvary
Diden't know that Bruce,. Thanks for telling me.
BUILD THE WALL!  Texas needs to take the lead in supporting THE WALL. Ask Americans for money, we'll pay!
Remember the Alamo! #AmericaFirst!

Could you spare a thought for the millions of Texas women who don't have access to affordable healthcare? #PlannedParenthood
Absolutely! Remember all those who have sacrificed their lives for freedom. #RemembertheAlamo @SenTedCruz
@tedcruz you two should leave their names out your mouths.  You Santa Anas.
At this point the Mexican Government might have been the better deal.
It is quite the place. The bullet holes are all over the front of the facade.
@tedcruz We remember!
That's like remembering the DNC!!!

That brought tears of joy to my eyes Gov.
@tedcruz and now a new cry for independence from the ineptitude that now serves, not the state,  but Trumpilini.
@tedcruz fuckimg KOREA

@tedcruz @senatormikelee Utah State Senate really let down the cause of Federalism w their vote against COS. Pathetic !

@tedcruz good idea let's rewrite history that way we won't repeat it...not, what a travesty
@tedcruz REMEMBER THE RUSSIAN CONNECTION. 
Yes Sir. This one.

https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html â€¦

I didn't figure you had an answer for that.
Probably because I was talking about Trump    You tried to change the subject.
Your tweet said "Russian connection". That was the subject of mine as well.
@tedcruz I bet they wish they'd lost than have the orange faced, tiny-handed spunkbubble in charge...
nope
@tedcruz Learn from them, Teddy.
I say just give it back to #Mexico and let them build a fence around it to keep the Gringos out @GovAbbott @DBTayor
@AndrewQuackson : I felt so proud as a kid in 7th grade as we studied Texas History including the Alamo & Battle of San Jacinto!
please remember the courage it sometimes take to fulfill campaign promises. We need innovative mass transit in Austin.
@SenTedCruz @$$holes don't forget that Mexicans fought 4 the Alamo as well. Think while u profile brown Americans #NoWall
Yes Sir they did. Quite a few. All here legally.
: The Alamo is epic history. Also is my Alma mater Sam Houston State. Disturbing news - they are funding BLM and WP classes! SAD!
@westtxminer there were a lot of Mexican who fought for Texas Independence. #dont #forget

Remember The Alamo!
Don't talk that way about the Texas martyrs there.
@iptuttle And to think, Hillary could have sent in the troops and didn't. Sad. #alamoghazi
That was when Texans fought for freedom. We are in a fight for personal freedom from religious tyranny now. Remember the Alamo!
Funny how the left hasn't demanded a Mexican flag flying next 2 an ISIS flag 2 show appreciation 4 O's open borders.
#Trump doesn't like #Losers
Why have we given away the care of the Historical place?
Much more courageous than our current crop of Texas leaders.
#TexansFirst
GM Sir. Have a good day. I was your flight attendant to LAX. So nice to meet you!
