@SenTedCruz And _clearly_ the time to fight for it is now! Never more threatened throughout the entire existence of our country.
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz If you can't see it, you're also a mindless leftist lemming, and a waste of time. But I repeat myself.
@CGAdamo @andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz You can't answer her question, because there's nothing to see.
@gusnorton @andreajmarkley No. I won't _waste my time_ answering her question because there's no truth she's willing to see. You too!
@andreajmarkley @CGAdamo @gusnorton  How about our right to choose to buy insurance and force pay others insurance too!!
@SenTedCruz  We are not free without shedding blood and thanks to our Veterans for doing so. Thanks for your support of them!!
@SenTedCruz I AGREE 100 PERCENT
@lindanye6615 @SenTedCruz So do I, which is why I'm a liberal.
@SenTedCruz Until someone has the person or parties prosecuted for changing the constitution to suit their needs,THIS COUNTRY WILL DIE!
@Finalsign @SenTedCruz No one is "changing the constitution to suit their needs". There is no constitutional amendment being put forth.
@ForgedBalance @SenTedCruz Best open ur eyes Schemer and Reid both Want to change First Amendment and excuse me what Obama
@SenTedCruz Consitution is the law, but people are trying to change it and take our freedom away! Nobody does nothing to the traitors why??
@Finalsign @SenTedCruz Who is doing this and what are they doing?
@SenTedCruz like...say...freedom to choose what I do with my own body??
@Paiyslee @SenTedCruz If you think there is no child in the womb then how in the h*ll did you get here, or anyone else for that matter?
@anjamom7 @SenTedCruz I am not debating when I consider a fetus to be a child. Point is its my decision, not yours, not govt.
@SenTedCruz grab your gun and go, tough guy.
Hi @SenTedCruz Does that mean you are a member of the ACLU?.......because  you know "Freedom can't protect itself".
@gumshoe77 @SenTedCruz That's why we have the best military in the world. Why don't you thank our servicemen for protecting it and you!
I thank a vet every time I see them @anjamom7 U should ask why @SenTedCruz voted against a bill that would give them enhanced ed benefits.
@SenTedCruz  that's is so true, we have to fought in the daily basis. The internal enemies that we have inside of the country
@SenTedCruz what a wordsmith.
@SenTedCruz  you are coldheart senater brrrrr !
@Blob_Fish @SenTedCruz No, that's just for liberals or the black community would be proud to stand with Dr. Ben Carson.
@SenTedCruz This is a book you might find interesting Senator
@SenTedCruz It's " TIME to Prosecute!! " NO MORE PROTECTING THE TRAITORS !!!
@SenTedCruz If you love #Freedom, why do you love an imaginary abusive slave master?
@SenTedCruz Not fit to be President. Hypocrite self absorbed self serving
@SenTedCruz "how to win fights" by teddy cruz.  Read green eggs and ham. Throw tantrums when you don't get your way.
@SenTedCruz I fought for your freedom in Vietnam, or was it to put money in the pockets of the military industrial complex? Guess which!
@SenTedCruz and it must be taught...apparently at home because schools are not doing so.
@SenTedCruz There is only one thing more important than freedom...LIFE! Happiness is 3rd. #prolife #education #armedforces #firstresponders
@SenTedCruz do you agree with that pastor that gays should be executed? You were on stage with him, and didn't voice any objection!
@SenTedCruz hardly. I think the pastor should be taken out the back and given a good beating for being a fuckhead
@SenTedCruz  i believe in you and think you are one of the best!
@SenTedCruz The environment too must be fought for. The generations to follow depend on these days..
@SenTedCruz You're best not quoting a guy talking about peace when that guy secretly sold missiles to our enemies #ContraScandal
@SenTedCruz I find your version a bit lop sided. I prefer all religious freedom, not just your brand. Your ideas remind me of the Nazis.
@SenTedCruz you are the devil. GOD WILL JUDGE U AT THE END. ENJOY HELL
@SenTedCruz god bless keep u the good fit
@SenTedCruz
So true!
You will need a team of believers, people of like-minded mentality.   Now is the time to recruit those who will follow.
@SenTedCruz Yet you voted for the Freedom Act and CISA.
@SenTedCruz .you got my vote a long time ago.god bless you..you have a vision for America and Israel.
AMEN @SenTedCruz fought for and protected 24-7-365, we are #GrassrootsRising the #ConservativeInsurgency we are coming.. #TedCruz2016
@SenTedCruz   whose version or definition of freedom are we talking about?
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad From whom??? the poor, the yearning masses, the elderly

@SenTedCruz When will the Book Obama has be open, how many more do you want to see killed, a million, 10 million, 100 million
@SenTedCruz Do you believe in the End of Time, the Book Obama has ends it.
@danielparks2016 @SenTedCruz You wat m8
@SenTedCruz When the hate ends so does the killing wars crime, The Book Obama has ends the hate and this time.
@SenTedCruz Do the people need countries when the people of Earth have peace, no.
Do you need religions when all have peace on Earth, no.
@SenTedCruz killing, war’s to survive as peace kills them.
Do countries need armies when all people have peace, no.
@SenTedCruz The reason Obama refuses to open the Book and end the hate, killing, wars is because the governments of the world need hate,
@SenTedCruz To have peace Obama has to open the Book he has, once it’s opened all hate killing wars crime end but Obama refuses to open it
@SenTedCruz @alexrileyiscool http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2015.pdf … US #20 in human freedom
@SenTedCruz All can have peace on earth today but none want peace only the hate killing wars and crime.
@SenTedCruz The political Favors and ASS KISSING MUST STOP!!  Time for Congress to do their JOB and protect  the constitution  or resign!!
@SenTedCruz You are NOT Reagan. You are a huckster, a liar, a fear mongerer & you have NO BUSINESS running our country.
@SenTedCruz Amén; non-informed people are the first ones to complain when they see, their rights taken away. why? They're blind agenda first
@SenTedCruz And this is that generation.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz I agree! Keep doing what you are doing! Never give up on our values!
@SenTedCruz Oh! I agree & that is why I watch Ted Cruz's actions especially when he is trying to take away people's rights.
@SenTedCruz I agree and I will and have fought for it
@SenTedCruz Reagan also fought for our #environment for the same reason.
You and all of your buffoons of colleagues seem to disagree.
@SenTedCruz listen to the new grimes album
