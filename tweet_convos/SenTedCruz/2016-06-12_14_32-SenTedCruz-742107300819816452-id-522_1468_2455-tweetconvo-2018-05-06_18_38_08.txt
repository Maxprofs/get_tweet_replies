Their objective, which they broadcast worldwide, is to murder or forcibly convert every American. https://twitter.com/sentedcruz/status/742105592723087360 …
.@SenTedCruz You never cared about gay people before. You don't get to use dead gay bodies as a political prop.
Geeze Guy ..that's simply NOT true. go spew your lies elsewhere
when has he cared about gay people?
he has said several times..what is great about constitution-it protects EVERYONE..that includes gays :)
he specifically targets gays on marriage, adoption & trans people for access issues. He doesn't want to protect all then
he doesnt target gays.. bigger fish to fry, he's said that several times.
Ted spoke at a conference that called for gays to be put to death.
your funny-oh that gave me a good laugh for the day, but no he didnt
But not one dollar to combat homophobia btw So glad you weren't nominated
you think tax $'s should be spent to "combat" homophobia?
In places like North Carolina & Indiana the gov't is homophobic
why? Marriage is a union of a man and woman. Instituted by a God you don't believe in!
Instituted by government, not god.
taken over by over-reaching govt! Marriage is a sacred covenant instituted by God. Between a man and woman!
Gov't was overreaching when they issued the first marriage license 300 yeats ago.
there were no marriage license issued 300 years ago.
And, I bet, you wonder why you were denied getting close to the White House.
why because he agrees that we need a president who isnt a coward
Is he going to blow up all the homophobic Americans, because that's what this guy is.
. He is speaking agaonst terrrorism not for
Doesn't matter, he couldn't get enough people behind his globally reprehensible carpet bombing ideology.
. Howeverbi do agree thatbwe need a president who will do something
And your suggestion to stifle an American terrorist? His parents immigrated under Reagan's helm, BTW.
i dont care a terrorist is a terroris and must be treated as a terrorist
We need voters who will vote you the fuck out for your inaction. But that won't happen in TX. You lucky. #DisarmHate #Enough
And you and your repub colleagues and your families should be first to deploy. Good Luck!
Tough words from a saber-rattling-chick hawk 
we still love you Ted
AND WE ALL KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ---> TRUMP !
TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP !!!
@rratkinson yes against its creators...WAKEUP
@Mike_USPatriot thank you!! I agree!! DONALD J TRUMP!!!
Finally! Now HOP on board the TRUMP TRAIN 󾓦󾓦 and let's bust terror and Make Americas military Great again.
YAY WAR! You're so good at sending other people's children to die for your bullshit.
#thanks for sharing about military, have a great Wednesday :) (Via ➪ https://bit.ly/freefollowers__  grow followers )
God bless America with Sen Cruz.
Please un-suspend your campaign & go to convention. We need you more than ever!!
Doesn't Congress have a role in the wars and action we take? Then show the bill or action you are proposing please.
This is my idiot Senator.

So sorry,  What a despicable psychopath with delusions of being THE Messiah. So sad.
Amen.
Maybe you need to reconsider what you pretend to be your religion. If you're a Christian ...
God bless you.
 @SenTedCruz Voted NO to Bill that would Stop Terrorists from Buying Guns! #NRAOwnsGOP
http://on.msnbc.com/1TpJ6Vt  @msnbc
Also, be clear about how much $$ creepy Cruz got from NRA and NRA related contributors. Traitor
@Reince BEST START PROMOTING TRUMP OR FORGET VETING ANY MUSLIM RADICAL OR NOT. CLINTON WANTS TO TRIPLE THEIR #'S. TRUMP R NO 1
@wkirkm We need youTED CRUZ as POTUS/CIC to bring integrity back to the WhiteHouse
A smart guy like you can find a legal way to keep assault rifles from being sold to a guy like the Orlando killer. Please try.
That was not you, Cruz.  You lost.  Big time,  Not welcome in your own party.  Please leave the stage.  You lost.
& We need a TX Sen. who will unleash the full force & fury of Congressional power to #stopgunviolence #ENOUGH #nationalsolution
we do need a strong @Gop president and the voters spoke, why are you not listening & helping instead of working for Hillary
You should break free of the establishment & check out Chris Keniston   http://chriskeniston2016.com/  
#VPA
We need senators who will STOP terrorists from slaughtering us on our own soil by buying LEGAL GUNS! #LOVE #filibuster
By all means, let's go to war with an Idea.
My thoughts on this Race Mr Cruz http://synthgames.com/truth/trump-vs-clinton …
https://twitter.com/PageSixBettie 
and you aren't going to be it!  Youre a small man, with small ideas not worthy of leading our great Nation. #GovtShutdownClown
#WriteInCruz Chump is only running interference for Hitlerry. He's in way over his head...so he'll just pass the buck.
Why has Adam Szubin, President's nominee for undersecretary of terrorism and financial intelligence not been given up/down vote?
Carpet bombing would end this shit right now.
.@SenTedCruz Hey, remember when you spoke at an event whose organizer said gays should get the death penalty?
Since Creepy Cruz seems like a closet gay guy, he must vociferously denigrate homosexuality as a cover instead of being proud
we need you as POTUS! #alwayscruz
you have D.Trump so get your reps to unite.we must stop lying Hilary he may not always be polically correct but he loves the USA
Agreed!
you can't bomb an idea, eventually you'll have to TALK
Thanks @SenTedCruz for your #2ndAmendment support. You are #NRA approved! #Guns
@dixieland4life That president will be Hillary Clinton, if you clowns don't get it together, and stop this division.
only if you lead from the front lines, we'll grant you a special commission.
this spineless president is more concerned w offending Muslims then Americans who die bec these animals r at war w us!
Yes!
Oh lying Ted and @realDonaldTrump stop capitalizing on the death of innocent people to score cheap points..pathetic
#OutlawWahabism sanction countries with #Sharia law, seize #Saudi assets, :ISIS is Wahabism! Must end Wahabism @kimguilfoyle
@FLMomNYGirl yes and that is POTUS Trump #MAGA
Please volunteer to go.
too little to late coming from u
As a fellow Texan, and U.S. citizen, my ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War. I could not agree with you more about ISIS.
Hey, if Cruz rules out HRC, will Trump get his support? Supreme Court is at risk! Time is running out! Tick Tock-Tick, Tock!
why have u accepted thousands of $ in donations from the NRA? Why did you reject the 2013 background checks bill?#Orlando
We need senators who will ban sales of weapons to suspected terrorists.
Then get on board with @realDonaldTrump...
Don't you think we should do something about the assault rifles ISIS legally bought in this country first? #guncontrol #Orlando
@c5hardtop1999 and a congress who will indict any oath breakers and derelicts of duty!!!
The need for Article V continues.
what the hell is wrong with you? Why do you want war and more killing? Fake Christian you are!
@instapundit That would be @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #VoteForTrump #Trump2016 #YouGotMyVote #TrumpForPresident
When are you going to denounce domestic hate, homophobia and violence---thats right #bigoTED can't denounce self & backers...
@instapundit Support Donald Trump! You Want That Corrupt Evil Witch In The WH?
Will you send your daughters?
I agree now EVERY DAY you delay teaming with TRUMP takes my vote for you farther away.  We are in for a real fight.  76049
@Uncle_Jimbo That is true and that President is Ted Cruz. So, where's the plan to Dump Trump and nominate Cruz?
Do the right thing in Cleveland! America will thank you!
@instapundit And what do we have? A Chicago race hustler, a secretive greedy criminal crone, and the dregs of the GOP Primary.
well, we all know how easy it is for you to convert. ISIS will have no problem with you.  So now you and Trump are BFF?
Radical Islam is a belief. You can't defeat a belief with bullets and bombs. History has proven that conclusively. @marcorubio
@instapundit 
Senator Cruz, if Donald Trump Becomes President Our Country is Doomed. 
#NeverTrump
@instapundit wow... How ....Trumpian.
@instapundit you sound like SpongeBob, you know this....right?
@instapundit Then Hillary's your candidate.
@instapundit I suspect you're going to get one in Nov.
@GaetaSusan vote trump he will come on senator all aboard
@GaetaSusan Are you a little late to the show? It's Trump or Killary. There is no alternative. Freedom or slavery.
not you. You are a quitter. Be man enough to honor the will of the people.
@GaetaSusan True. Thank GOD it won't be you. You'll just bring more Muslims here for your big oil donors & Club For Growth. 
@GaetaSusan The sooner we acknowledge that Obama armed & financed ISIS to overthrow Assad, the sooner we can fight ISIS.
ha!
more guns & bombs? Because the previous ones worked so well, right? Can you offer any other response that does not involved g&b?
What do you propose?  Bombing?  Yep...doing that. US soldiers on the ground?  Yep...doing that.
have your children join the military first
@JimSmit24747730 MR. CRUZ HOPEFULLY WHEN MR. TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT YOU WILL SUPPORT HIM AND MAKE THAT A REALITY
Sure. Will you be sending your kids and your relative's kids into war? Can't have the little poor people be the only ones, right
you mean like carpet bombing only the bad ones?
and which candidate do you think will be stronger on the terrorist?? Stand up and support Trump for president! Protect America
Isis needs to be destroyed. All usa citizens are in danger, and we need someone to kick em out of here, and keep them out
@NahBabyNah 
If he had been a Ted Cruz supporter would you have been for defeating Ted Cruz?
Hope establishment Republicans know that a President Hilary won't be that President.
@PatriotJewel Agreed... I'm sorry Sen.Cruz will not be POTUS this time, he would be GREAT.
.@SenTedCruz There's only one candidate for president left who will do that. Do you now endorse Donald Trump and pledge your full support?
Well, I hate to say it, but I don't think the remaining presidential candidates have the competency to destroy ISIS.
hello Donald Trump.
U Rep need to stop fighting. The Dems love it. PLEASE
We still need a fighter like you to ensure our Constitutional Rights aren't trampled on.
It takes a more thoughtful person to realize there is more to this than that! Glad you will never be POTUS!
While I agree, how come the Senate or Congress has no reaction? hands tied? following @POTUS theory of HOLYIER THAN THOU?
Ted, your lips are moving. Might want to look into that.
ISIS was created in large part because of the force & fury of the American military. #BlackFlagsofIsis by @JobyWarrick
So for you Ted, would that be Hillary or Trump that would be best to achieve that? You haven't supported our nominee yet Ted.
ADDRESS the deviant behaviors in the MUSLIM CULT. #SLAVERY Pedophilia, Female genital mutilation, Child Brides, Honor Killings.
Welcome aboard the #TrumpTrain, we've been expecting you...
@DrottM You & the rest of the @GOP should be demanding that #Obama be impeached for being a traitor to our nation #uniteandfight
Then run third party. Let the revolution for a brave America begin. You brought hope, so now deliver. You have many votes.
Not time for that, yet, Edgar... Let the delegates vote, first. @SenTedCruz
Yes, I agree but; The GOP has made its deal. Better to plan for battle than wait for the battle to hit you first
Regardless, it's too soon for @SenTedCruz to publicize a decision. Donald Trump isn't the nominee, yet.
HILLARY 2016!!!
@tgradous #If you truly love America, u & @MittRomney @JohnKasich @marcorubio & the 300 would get behind Trump & defeat Hillary
@tgradous Did you endorse Mr. Trump yet? #PresidentTrump
so publicly support Trump you prideful weakling.
You can't keep pretending like your religion DOESN'T condone the killing of gay people. Leviticus 20:13 #ChrisitanityIsISIS
You're so full of crap.
after 15 years over there, will that really work?
why do you Ted support  the NRA and the sale  of the  AR15 .
THE CHURCH KILLER DID NOT YELL OUT A FALSE GOD'S NAME BUT THE ORLANDO KILLER DID IT'S WAR. GET LOUDER!
@TaperedOut -That could have been you-but it isn't-praise the Lord!!
PS, using this tragedy to jab at the President is in poor taste. Shame.
Please tell me what we should do that we aren't. You want a ground war? Nuclear? Stop talking tough and get an actual plan
We need a president who is going to ALSO take a stance against these horrid tragedies by implementing stricter gun laws.
wouldn't Hillary Clinton be considered a accessory to ISIS activities
great TRUMP endorsement!! Thanks
also wouldn't that entail prosecuting those who armed ISIS namely Chief democrats, Obama and military commanders he appointed
this president only seems interested in censorship and disarming Americans making it easier for terrorists to kill us all.
Teddy, YOU pay for the invasion and lead it your Chickenhawk SELF! LMAO
Will you apply for a "Write in Candidate" for President? What will it hurt? You may be very surprised.
- Liar! Support American LGBT! We know your false BS about Islam is meant to create another victim group!
like the preacher who into u who wants us gay people dead who cheers this killer u make me sick
we need a president who will implement common sense gun laws #guncontrol #EndGunViolence
- Dude, even the guy's family said name-dropped #ISIS to confuse the bigotry motivating the attack. Support LGBT Texas.
@lmsjrpol You had an issue with drone attacks and now you want to unleash the FULL FORCE of the US Military on ISIS.
"Click on the following link with the header Obama is a fool." https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=Obama%20is%20a%20fool&src=typd … …
When, exactly, did you serve?
Yes, we need a President Ted Cruz!
good luck with that. Worked so well in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not.

When similar attacks occurred in Paris, French Gov't moved in quickly, raided nearby mosques and arrested the culprits. But with Obama it's
the bearcat, used to breach the wall is part of the equipment that Obama is taking from local law enforcement. It saved lives
thank heaven u aren't president.U know NOTHING about this kind of war. u are IGNORANT about CIA's own warnings about "blowback"
@TFinn82 bomb the HELL out of them
@LiveFreedomOrDi Cant have Hillary as President even if have to vote Trump.Cant afford anymore American lives.Time to fight back
so are you calling for boots on the ground?  The shooter was born in NY.  Where are you going to invade?
who would you have bombed to stop the gay hater in Orlando? You would have bombed Orlando?
You have one running Ted.  Stop the crap and get behind him!!  Security, Economy, and the Supreme Court outweigh your pride!
then suit up and train ur ass so u can come with the military, instead of being behind a desk..
Are you about to endorse the clown who dragged you and your family through the mud?  #Spineless
shut up dude
You, of all the scum, do not get to make this about your cause.
You have condoned hate crimes.
This is about the slaughter of 50 LGBTQ people; this is not about ISIS. Stop.
Thanks Senator for your leadership on this act of terrorism. Hope you can unite w Trump. Would like to see you in Cabinet.
First, we need a president who will properly identify the enemy that has declared war on US since 1998.
what do we do there is not a viable candidate to vote for. This country is doomed, we don't win regardless who gets the nod
Si, let's create less radical Islamists by killing civilians,  destroying their infrastructure, & occupying their countries. 
We need you Sir.
Carpet bombing civilians in Syria won't stop a lone madman in Orlando.
Empty words from a senator who won't vote to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists at home.
What about a white guy from Indiana who was arrested before he could commit mass murder? Should we unleash full force and fury?
Yes exactly and quickly!!!!
US under @realDonaldTrump needs to coordinate with @PutinRF_Eng to obliterate ISIS & Boko Haram etc. Repub's need 2 back 'em
this isn't even wholly about Isis this is a hate crime by a hateful person
