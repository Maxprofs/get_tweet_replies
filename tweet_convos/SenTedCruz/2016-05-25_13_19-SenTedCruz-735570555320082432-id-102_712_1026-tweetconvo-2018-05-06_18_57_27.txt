STOP trying to take away Their rights by claiming,falsely,that religious rights are being sacrificed.
Transgender Americans and LBGTQ Americans have a right to live without fear. You & the religious right are infringing on..
Women & children have the right to live without fear too! We should be able to use a restroom without fear!
You do realize that you've probly been peeling with Transgender people for decades right?
And u realize you are endangering children women and messing up children's minds with your absurd ideas?
If anything Im helping to make the world better by not being so rigid in what my ideas about gender&identity are
Like I said make a third bathroom. Who's stopping u? Just stay out of mine.
Wow. Your narrowmindedness is astounding. You should try reading up on the subject. It may help your ignorance.
Transgender Americans are covered under The Constitution no matter what YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS ARE!!!!!
.@joylladiebnx @GovAbbott @POTUS What about OUR rights??  Transgender "rights" are more important than the 99.7 % rest of us??!  HELL NO!
And bartender should be ignorant. Autocorrect...Smh.
@DianaBialkowski @POTUS Republicam controlled Congress should stop him but Speaker Ryan is working for Obama.  Mark my words.
If Ryan(e) is Rep, than I am not!
Years ago, I said Obama was Muslim and socialist. Proven right. I'm equally sure Ryan is a traitor to GOP
Ryan owns the Omnibus Bill! Did U tell him to fund PPH, Illegals, Refugees?I didn't! US &Americans first!
I learned in 7th grade socialists want to flood the country with poor people.  That is Ryan's objective.
&uneducated!INS used 2have guidelines re our needs as 2who could come 2US!Mayb that's what H1B visas r abt!
Border guards ordered to stand down as illegals xing. No wonder border guards endorsing Trump, unprcedent
They arrested at least one younger ale who was acting stupid!
You don't have enough $ for #education #schools yet you waste #money on ridiculous #lawsuits
please have in inpeach
@muzikgirl11 @POTUS Bravo to you #Texas I wish more states had the courage to go against the Czar!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS And other that platitudes, what has the GOP done?  Nothing. We handed you everything you needed.
thanks for sharing! I've highlighted you on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1P2cuni 
Go Greg, GO!
@gcamp4 @POTUS That Obama keeps you busy.. You're a true American Hero Governor
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  And how much longer do you have in office?
once again, you make me ashamed to be a Texan. You're not half the leader our president is.
You're right about that. Obama is a hack..
@HeidiL_RN @POTUS probably a shorter  list of what he didn't  trample  on
Stop your OFFICIAL City Bullies  http://stopleeclarkpasadena.com 
@gcamp4 @POTUS I applaud Governor Abbott and wish other governors throughout the United States would follow suit. #Trump2016
@TrumpPatriot4 @POTUS yea yea revolution yea fright show this shit kiss your Texas@ depart from the federal goverment
@SamThiessen @POTUS At this point I would be happy if your stripped him of all power until the election. OR arrest him
The hate and ignorance coming out of Texas is unparalleled. If it were the1600's your guv would be burning people at the stake.
.@GovAbbott  You're suppose to represent ALL Texans inclulding LGBT folks. Your fear & bigotry shouldn't govern TX. #NoHateInMyState #txlege
Thank you. Worst @POTUS ever. #ObamaLegacy
@FLGovScott @AGPamBondi ADD Florida to this lawsuit Don't expose women when they r vulnerable
.@POTUS has routinely trampled on the United States Constitution. #Texas will fight back. http://bit.ly/1TzMzVX  
ashamed to be a Texan. This is awful.
thank you governor at least you have common sense
@mikepfingston2 @POTUS and just think how bad it will be if Trump gets in. He can't even spell Constitution
@realDonaldTrump The people must get behind Governors who are digging in against an evil President.
Time for the Republic to impeach America's first Muslim President, Hussein Obama, for his Constitutional over-reach.
.@GovAbbott More than #bathrooms 
Read 10th Amendment. Obama ADMITTED NO Legal Authority Over States; Then Threatens Pull edu $ = TYRANNY
speak for yourself, unlike you, I believe everyone is to be treated equal and for you to do this makes me disgusted.
Sorry, Gov, but The Dear Donald has some bad news for you. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-caitlyn-jenner-bathroom-tower/story?id=38566263 …
u are the worst leader the state of Texas has ever had and we had several idiots before u..and quit cherry picking u idiot.
TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz sits on his hands while our Veterans die waiting to see a doctor or be admitted.
this ain't gonna end well. First Houston and now it's the whole state.
yes he has. And you are doing the same disservice to Texas school kids. You want to stop "writing checks? Start with STAar
so what your saying is that it's unconstitutional to not be allowed to discriminate against transgender people?
.@GovAbbott @POTUS I just moved to Texas.  This confirms my decision to move here.  Proud Texan!
@Courage1791 @POTUS Is this about his bathroom decree to schools?
YES & tired of executive action orders. Federal govt. has become 2 big. Petitioning for a Convention of States

finally got the balls to sue nobama administration? At the end of his run? LOL
“@GovAbbott: @POTUS has routinely trampled on the US Constitution. #Texas will fight back. http://bit.ly/1TzMzVX  ”
Hey @GovAbbott, how do you not know these DoE policies have been around for years? Read your DoE Title IX compliance from last year. @POTUS
he probably reads "my pet goat" upside down. I hear republicans do that a lot
Yes and yes!  Why hasn't our DC reps in Congress speak up and step out. Thankful for you!
go after the real danger..GUNS...what a waste of our $$ and time.  You have no problem asking for federal aid

@SenTedCruz @POTUS senator Cruz. TY for running.  Trump feels the same way..please tell your followers to vote for him.
@RobinEnochs @POTUS 
Good for ' y'all !' Just a bit of Australian humour there @GovAbbott  
You trample on MY rights by not living up to ur promise to stop all tollroads incl theAggie tollroad#stopSH249 ur no conservative
I understand your motive, but aren't you rather blowing this out of proportion? #LGBTQrights
@DrSueDVM @POTUS He apparently doesn't respect states rights OR knows and ignores.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I love Texas
Your treatment of abortion rights supporters and LGBT citizens tramples on their constitutional rights.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I wish this was my Gov.

@SenTedCruz You two are advocates of trampling on rights. This is not a theocracy, nor is it a confederation.
. Keep up the good work Governor!
#SuckSeedAndFuckOff
You're disgraceful and history will not treat you kindly
@SenTedCruz @POTUS WAKE UP AMERICA just because he is black doesn't give him the right to violate the constitution
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
:Potus blew,it to be greater than any muslim alive,past,or present...=CHRIST JESUS....sura Ali Imran iyat 55...

Gov Abbott you are not alone  ! Millions support you and your Staff  !
@SenTedCruz @POTUS can't wait until that monkey is out of office.

@SenTedCruz @POTUS Don't mess with Texas baby!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz that's one reason you are not the GOP nominee,stop being an Obstructionist along with Gov Greg Abbot.
#CruzersUnited #CruzCrew its time we stand and take this god giving country away grom t.he liberals
