@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz @EPA Perhaps you would be a bit better informed if you had to deal with EPA regarding this "rule".
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz @EPA This rule has nothing to do with keeping water clean. It is a way for EPA to dictate land use. EPA IS LYING
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz @EPA You desperately need up close personal experience with this rule. EPA regions are going WAY beyond the rule
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz @EPA Go look up the case law! Any first year lawyer could do it! It's public information! Sheesh.....
@SenTedCruz @EPA  Cruz/  GOP want 2 get rid of the EPA  SO they DO NOT have 2 Protect the Environment
@SenTedCruz @EPA EPA has lost EVERY court challenge to this rule even in liberal courts. Kinda speaks for itself.....
@SenTedCruz @Conssista @EPA ..will eventually regulate how much water is in ur toilet bowl, is it too much, too little, to cover their BS.
@87a374f489684cf @SenTedCruz @EPA Federal Gov't needs to get out of our business for good once & for all. Shut down 3/4 DC, we don't need it
@SenTedCruz @suziique03 @EPA The EPA should no longer exist! It has become an Obama weapon against America's jobs engine! Too intrusive!
@SenTedCruz @GaetaSusan @EPA 今天我心情好 。我就同老弟说两句，你是不是也想打退堂鼓啊，如果不是的话。把弟兄们组织好想清楚自己的路，
@SenTedCruz @EPA ... This batch of candidates is smarter than any Democrat they could find to go up against them.
@SenTedCruz @EPA News Break: @GOP Pres. Candidates demand simple questions for next debate! Don’t expose their lack of knowledge! lol
@drakestevens @SenTedCruz @EPA @GOP the last debate was not but crap questions. Want to know what and how. Not liberal BS.
@SenTedCruz @Linda18788 @EPA Just like Obama wants to control people with healthcare, the EPA wants control of their land use.
@SenTedCruz @EPA what the hell happened to the 9th and 10th amendments? Commerce clause is not an excuse for tyranny
@SenTedCruz @EPA Cruz Does not want 2 Protect the environment So Cruz Says "Lets Blame The Government or Media, its THEIR fault"
@SenTedCruz @freedomtex @EPA Just what we need -- NOT! This is another reason why EPA should be defunded!
@SenTedCruz @EPA I hope whoever is elected will dismantle this mafia organization.
@SenTedCruz @EPA < has done such a fine job w/ mine waste & 2 rivers, Puddles R ALL they should oversee!& that might b stretch of abilities
@SenTedCruz @EPA they must be DEFUNDED & CLOSED and investigated for misuse of public money...
@SenTedCruz @DelilahNoBSzone @EPA Oh, joy
@SenTedCruz @EPA The fanatical epa changed "navigable waters" from where a ship can go to a walkable stream. Total theft!
@SenTedCruz @EPA The EPA needs cut off from all funding. They are absolutely anti-American!
@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber @EPA just wait until the EPA tell the American Citizen where and when they can empty their Hot Tub.
@SenTedCruz @EPA One Day history will be very kid too you!

@SenTedCruz @freedomtex @EPA "But it's a breeding ground for mosquitoes!" ~ Any LBGT EPA Guy in this regime.

@SenTedCruz just checked the @EPA website, only has link to "summary" of the rule, not complete verbiage. Real Transparent (for DEMS)
@SenTedCruz @EPA Down with the EPA! It's my right as an American to drink dirty tap water and breath toxic air!!
@SenTedCruz @EPA OMG more regulations really? Get out of our lives
