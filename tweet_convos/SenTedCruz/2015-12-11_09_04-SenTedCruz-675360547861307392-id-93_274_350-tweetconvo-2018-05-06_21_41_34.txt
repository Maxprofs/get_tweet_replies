@SenTedCruz I won't cast a vote 4Potus 4 a woman/man that can't reach across the aisles in DC. &more disturbing 1 that acts like a maniac.
@reagangalpal @SenTedCruz missregan you should consider the similarities of Cruz to Regan. This is closer than to Trump.
@Ricardo72852905 not true. #Reagan forged for decades-old proven TITANS of business whereas @SenTedCruz is just as litigant as @barackobama.
@reagangalpal @SenTedCruz @BarackObama the man was a great president with a great team. He was an actor and used popularity to be governor.
@SenTedCruz Tempting idea, but Careful!  If this had been in effect in 1957, how many Thalidomide babies would there be in this country?
@RedComynes @SenTedCruz As it is, there are approximately 30 #thalidomide survivors in the US.
@SueWagnerWhite 
I knew there were a number of cases here.  I'm sure it would have been many thousands without the FDA action.
@RedComynes Yes, here in Canada we had about 150, now down to 94. Extrapolate that by millions of Americans...
@SenTedCruz Like stem cell research? Religion is a barrier that needs to be torn down.
@SenTedCruz get on ticket with Trump !!! Trump/ Cruz Ticket @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz -- Headline: Cher Labels Ted Cruz "Satan Incarnate." || Oh, well... Anything to keep her fossil record spinning at 78, I s'pose.
@SenTedCruz This is true. Government has never and will never be an efficient business operator.  There is no financial accountability.

@SenTedCruz climate change? We have real problems rep.& dems. Need to start working together or no one is going to vote!
@SenTedCruz Trump's job is to divide the GOP. If he doesn't get the nomination, he will run as 3rd party. If he wins, Hillary wins anyway.
@shockresistant2 @SenTedCruz You need to take into account the differences in Western versus Eastern Republicans:
@shockresistant2 @SenTedCruz You are welcome. A Ted & Rand ticket & holding a Repub Senate & house looks, to me, our last & best chance.
@SenTedCruz Trump 2016. You would make a great V.P. As President, you are bought and paid for by big oil- Not Good. GO Donald
@SenTedCruz Yes !  Sell more fetal parts, let Science move onward. Vote Cruz and get yours.

@SenTedCruz @SweetFreedom29 OCare is costing my brother $1100 a month in medical with a$12K deductible. How insane!
@ABWright824 @SweetFreedom29 @SenTedCruz $50K a year in salary doesn't go far with premiums like this!
@SenTedCruz Senator, all I need to know how you are going to protect American workers against H1B visas. It is killing us.

@TINAHILLSTROM1 @SenTedCruz Isn't it so, what they do behind their back like Saint Ted Cruz Wall Street can barely wait & lobbyist prtying
@SenTedCruz Looks like the mainstream media has gotten to Cruz#Trump
@SenTedCruz Could accomplish same with law affirming each state's right to opt out of any regulatory scheme. Cure many problems.
@SenTedCruz we need to tear down the Scandal that continues at the PHX VA MEDICAL CENTER
@SenTedCruz so today your a doctor not a dictator
@SenTedCruz Yeah like bans on embryonic stem cell research. 
@SenTedCruz So to block government from inhibiting innovation, you're going to resign from politics, right?
@SenTedCruz @kksheld You forgot corrupt insurance cartel Ted.
@SenTedCruz Since FDA regs are treated as laws and constitutionally Congress makes the laws, Congress having final say is absolutely proper
@SenTedCruz I'm with Cruz, down with government!
@SenTedCruz it pains me to say this but you're doing good work w RESULT act. Doesn't change everything else you're wrong about, but thx
@SenTedCruz that tweet is why trump is beating the brakes off you. Sounds like that stuff that goes with peanut butter you know fluff. Trump
@SenTedCruz You need to teardown the barriers to Medical Cannabis..
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump allowing their corrupt drug companies to make a killing here, literally.  Trolling for the VP job Mr. Cruz?
@SenTedCruz And the prices / cost of them over-priced by the medical buzzard.
@SenTedCruz please address your views on free trade.
@SenTedCruz Yes, moron. Put the untested drugs on the market and let people die. "Oops, guess that one didn't work."
@SenTedCruz Do your people nod their heads like they know what you're talking about when you spout this BS?
@SenTedCruz Yeah Teddy, you pretend you want "medical innovation" whilst at the same time trying to deny those with bad or no jobs from it?
@SenTedCruz  When the muslim terrorists attack Washington D.C. then Congress will put a muslim ban.
@SenTedCruz Yeah sure Rafael, like you Tea Partiers haven't been prioritizing barricading progress? LOL
.@SenTedCruz You mean we need to make it easier for those who profit from people getting sick. How do you sleep at night?
@SenTedCruz  Hey dopey. Drugs r sure innovative. A years worth of som cost as much as a caddy. The drug innovators blocked cheaper Canada 1s
@SenTedCruz  Do you Rs spiel anything other than BS for corporations. The answer is a resounding no. That is why the GOP is now dying.
@SenTedCruz @SenSanders all that innovation will go to waste if people can't pay for the drugs in the first place
@SenTedCruz First we wanted the government to lead, then, to follow. Today we'll be happy if it just got out of the way.
@SenTedCruz All talk and no action.  We cannot trust you or any other "Establishment" candidate.  TRUMP!
@TrumpFanDFW @SenTedCruz Wake up you #TrumpZombies , #Trump is a big govt elitist w/ Republican talking points. #RejectEmperorTrump
@PoliticsPaladin @SenTedCruz Trump is our single best hope for safety and economic prosperity.
@TrumpFanDFW @SenTedCruz That's a pretty big shovel you're using to toss that pro-Trump fertilizer! We need no king! #IWillNeverVote4Trump
@SenTedCruz Stop Obama care. That has done more damage to medical innovation than anything in history.
@SenTedCruz you are still a great candidate though
@SenTedCruz Big Pharma paid U to say that. Ted Cruz is a corrupt shill.
@Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz big government paid you to say that.
@JnapsPolitics20 @Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz lol! So funny!  Bug government is proving to be dangerous to AMERICAN lives
@SenTedCruz if you speak out against Trump I will believe you are not in league with him
