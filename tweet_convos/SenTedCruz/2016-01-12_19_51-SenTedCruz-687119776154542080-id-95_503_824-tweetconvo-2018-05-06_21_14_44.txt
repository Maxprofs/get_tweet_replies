@SenTedCruz @POTUS why do republicans SUCK at creating jobs?? #SOTU
@Kleptocratia @SenTedCruz @POTUS should it even be the President's job to create jobs?
@Seth_man @SenTedCruz @POTUS funny how conservatives complain all day long about "Obama job creation".
@Kleptocratia @Seth_man @SenTedCruz @POTUS government cannot "create" jobs
@chipsmelly @Seth_man @SenTedCruz @POTUS false. Do you know what public sector jobs are? Reagan and Bush sure did.
@Kleptocratia @Seth_man @SenTedCruz @POTUS gov can only allocate money and resources less efficiently than the free market
@chipsmelly @Kleptocratia @Seth_man @SenTedCruz @POTUS is allocating all the money to CEOs more efficient? Gtfo kid
@Taylor_Poe @Kleptocratia @Seth_man @SenTedCruz @POTUS on the contrary, gov protects ceos from competition, also creating inefficiency
@SenTedCruz you aren't qualified to judge @POTUS.
@88_Odalist @SenTedCruz @POTUS  it's too bad Ted Cruz has no respect for the first amendment
@88_Odalist @SenTedCruz Obama embarrassed Cruz and now he's on #kellyfile trying desperately to regain any semblance of dignity. #SOTU
@88_Odalist @SenTedCruz False. He has one year left.
