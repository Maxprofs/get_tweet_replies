*SORRY, WE IN DEEP DISAGREEMENT HERE.
*WE ALL SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DICTATORS FALL, TERRORIST TAKE THEIR PLACE. NEVER GOOD.
WHY DONT YOU TAKE THE DISAGREEMENT AS A FRIEND?
BECAUSE REGARDLESS , IM STILL COOL WITH YOU.
^NOPE, JUST ATTACK #ISIS, DO #NOT START WW3, PLEASE GO AWAY TED, YOUR HURTING MY SUPPORT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
Hope congress don't sabotage him like  they did Obama.  Oh yes its a GOP congress, not one vowed to make him fail as they did Pres. Obama
I Bet if you Were Physically there the SADISTIC BARBARIC Affects On INNOCENT babies, young kids.. You wouldn't say that!!
That's Joke  you all cut down everything he tries to do I hope he talks with his Generals and makes the decisions !
Senator Cruz will you make the case to increase the number of Syrian children and their families to come to the US as refugees?
No Not until Vetting is VERY UPDATED, NEW GUIDELINES
Immigration reform will accomplish that and more. It can all be spelled out and won't be challenged like the Muslim ban.
Looking forward also, assured they wont stonewall Trump as they did Obama
Take care You are Supporting ISIS by such strikes
Not hardley
he don't give two goddams about refugees who is fleeing dying daily of starvation suddenly want to avenged same people?

What happened 2 waiting until we know exactly what the hell is going on $ would've been better spent on #Medicare4All than expensive message
It wasn't done in Iraq. Why change GOP hawkism now
Love seeing Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain contributing to Fox News. These guys are stellar and represent America!
CRUZ YES Rest, just Recently
POTUS throw some bombs to the bad guy is better than OBama throw money to r enemy.
Holy fuck. Stop trying to invade and police the world. Nobody wants you there. You guys are the definition of insanity...look it up
Please vote this coward out!
Ted, this is a different POTUS..he is firm, strong, decisive, earnest...for the overall good of America. Work w him for America sake!!!!
Ted, c'mon dont fixate urself to the fancy fireworks...let's move on! Party's over! Focus on what YOU can do for America n Americans!
Putin needs to worry about internal issues. Time to declare dual citizenship for waring Ukraine & Russian factions as settlement for peace.
YES, BUT BOTH THE CONGRESS & PRES. TRUMP MUST BE READY TO ACCEPT ANY EVENTUALITY LIKE TRUMP HAS JUST DONE WITHOUT QUERY .
Do not DISREPECT my messiah.....hilarious.
Will you vote against it again, like in 2013?
Regan didn't go to congress when he sent jets to bomb Libya. Clinton didn't go to congress when he bombed Somalia. POTUS do what you must.
#neverserved : really easy to posit escalation with no skin in the game or experience
I thought he was supposed to make his case before shooting.
I look forward to his impeachment. #traitortrump
We agree with you, Senator Cruz!
I begin to lose faith in Ted Cruz
trump isn't a strong leader this action shows how incompetent he is...adding fuel to the existing fire 
So it's better to sit back and watch innocent people, including children, die..... #Insane
He better request support from Congress and there better be a strategy. You don't use the military to send a warning.
"I look forward to the President telling us anything about what he's doing. Literally, ANYthing."
To bad he doesn't have any leadership in Congress
@TresM4 @SenTedCruz cause if there's one thing we've been missing in the last 8 years it's another war. Let's f-c6 sh1t up #budget
PRstunt. Trump telegraphd adv notice of strike. base evacuated. didn't even blow up the runway. Misdirect #trumprussia #strategery #facepalm
Don't hold your breath Sen. Cruz
Someone who has never served making the case for war. Appalling.
Rand Paul should have made similar statement. Support Trump, guide him no open negative comments. Thanks Cruz.
how we defend our country by sending missals from the ship on the other side of the Ocean..,did Assad attack UA ever..?
@TexasGOP @texasdemocrats 
Ted Cruz cannot represent Texas. He's a coward that sacrificed his wife's honor to be in Trump's good graces!
Woke up, read the words "President Trump"and fell off my chair injuring my head. I feel better in my new reality. Golfing at Maralago later.

Whatever Paul Ryan says I have to believe the opposite.
Like Obama did and was voted Dow by @GOP ?
Well Ted, Putin's Boy will have to consult with Vlad First.

That's how it works now in the #USA

MR TRUMP TELL PUTIN STOP MEDDLING IN SYRIA, USE WORDS THAT WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HEAR YOU! ONCE AND FOR ALL PUT COUNTRY FIRST!
You retweeted yourself..Love watching yourself much?  So brave.
SEEMS LIKE POTUS IS LISTENING TO HILLARY CLINTON , SHE SUGGESTED THE NIGHT BEFORE WHAT POTUS CARRY ON LAST NIGHT! 
Town Hall?
REPUBLICANS ARE WAR MUNGERS, WE NEW THAT IF YOU GUYS WERE PUT IN POWER AGAIN YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE US TO WAR!AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN! 
If Pres Trump would have went to Congress, would it have been leaked out that it was going to happen? His campaign ran on surprise attacks.
U.S followed media assumptions about Chemical weapons used by Syrian regime same As Iraqi Nuclear Weapons in 2003 , U just Supported ISIS
No tether action he did a measured response leave it there
The Congress he won't do anything.These people couldn't get together in a Bill imagine what can you expect. No trust in the Congress!
I hope NONE! No war with Syria, this attack "might" have been warranted, strong message sent to the world, but no need to get involved!
No boots in Syria, but drop as much ordinance as necessary to prevent atrocities. But Russia WILL respond. China may follow. #BePrepared
FOX NEWS IS A SOCIALIST NETWORK AND CANNOT BE TRUSTED
In this action Pres. Trump was right, this man is a monster that killed his own people specially babies, horrible. If he would ask the
Ask him why he told the Russians before congress (who of course told the Syrians who moved out their staff and equipment)
We need Special Forces to go in and take Assad Out. Horrible that innocent ppl were killed but Trump's striking while the iron is hot!
no
After Easter break that is...
Do something right: oppose his illegal bomb strategy to enhance his reputation.--from Texas
I look forward to congress making the case to Trump for his impeachment.
Really? So the atrocities back in 2013 weren't bad enough for you? Is that why you wouldn't vote to allow PBO to do a military strike? Pfft
In the US. national interest?
why is this mf getting coverage all of a sudden? go back to where you've been after making ass of self during TRUMP victory!
Trump is unstable.  He fights with people on twitter.  Now he's bombing sites w/o advice.  Who else will he bomb b/c he gets an "itch" to?
Cruz is a no-talent, morally-compromised ass hat. Can't wait for him to be voted out!
For the US, now is the time to bow out, support none of the remaining players, defend North America, and let the cards fall where they may.
The GOPcan't even take care of domestic issues, trump is ignorant about govt. and you want to add another country to send our blood/treasure
Good. Ted Cruz is not one of the faint hearted.
What is our foreign policy?  I say it we make it up as we go?
Ted's voice annoys me almost as much as his face
He should have started with congress!
F&*%^ congress
Ted Cruz selling out his wife again.
He can't wait for that sweet millitary paycheck
Why the change of heart asshole? https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/ted-cruz-why-ill-vote-no-on-syria-strike/2013/09/09/34750cde-1972-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html …
Don't you think he should have done that first?
Good point but the Pres.did not declare  war, it was a retaliation to the nerve gas used by Assad on its own people, message to all bullies.
what if he's got more gas and uses it on the Jews.what's next.ww111?
But make sure to gag little Mark as he's as war parakeet.
rubio lives inside macains underware
FOX..... OUT OF ALL THE SENATORS THERE ( YOU ASK TED TRUMP HATING GRUZ FOR COMMENTARY..... WTF.... REALLY
Safe zones. In for a penny, help stop the migration.
As I say & have said stay on point Donald J Trump & CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST SHOW OF POWER Bashar should have been killed!
not
trump is the devil
I think the next move will be made by Syria/Russia...if there's a move to be made.
Whatever happens no matter how you feel make sure you doing whatever you can to work together on all subjects. Maybe agree to disagree
#LyinTed this tool needs to go away.
#RESIST #Distraction What's the justification for a preemptive military strike on a sovereign nation that's no immediate threat to the US,
Obama, as well as Hillary,  have long wanted to do this very thing but Reps would not hear of it. So why now?
always level headed as always ted
An AUF would be the best way forward...
THANKYOU Ted #MAGA
That's because you're a warmonger. Make sure you set your son up to join the military as soon as you can!
Let's destroy bombs and missiles Damascus entirely.
Are we still bombing brown people? Why?
Nothing too much spent on it already. Give the millions to the poor at home
Comparison of people being gassed, which is against international law/people in America not working and wanting more freebies is pathetic.
I want to see him prove that Assad gassed his own people. The war mongers and chicken hawks have come out of the closet.
Thank you Mr president. God be with you and our try troops
Trump didn't need Congresses approval. He did what needed to be done.
Yes he did. Assad could have wiped out his whole population while Congress discussed it. I think we need Rob ONeill do a Bin Laden on Assad.
I agree. And then head on over to North Korea and pick up Kim Jong Un!
Yep...Remove the threat
Is that a... #CruzCut
the real laying Ted
make Syria pay the 94 million for the bombs we dropped.
And there it is. As I said before.. Business as usual. Time to get paid.
Servile puppy says what?
How is this not an act of war against Syria?
It's political theather. Small base. Russia warned before Congress notified. Syria likely warned, too. A show of might with little change.
#USA - supporters of ISIS !
fox news shilling for the globalists how predictable you are . you pretend to be conservitives while betraying your base #NoMoreWars
