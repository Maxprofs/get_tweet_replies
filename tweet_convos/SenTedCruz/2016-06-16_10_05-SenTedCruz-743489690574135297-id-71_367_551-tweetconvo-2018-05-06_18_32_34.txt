Our nation is at war. Radical Islamic terrorism has declared jihad on America http://cs.pn/1ttnhx5 
And your rhetoric isn't helping.
Rhetoric???? You're concerning with language instead of defeating the enemy.
It feeds ISIS propaganda machine. We will never win this war. But we can slow it down until burns itself out.
ISIS isn't going to stop attacking us because of what words politicians use to describe them. Use your brain.
They use those words to gather more strength and followers. We must stop giving them oxygen. Lose lips sink ships.
The Nazis were Nazis right?  The Japanese Imperial Navy were Japanese, right? North Koreans =North Koreans, right? ISIS is ISIS
Again a different kind of war.
War is War. The only way to win is to defeat the enemy. No new rules here. It isn't complicated.
I am never reading your disrespectful, obnoxious rants again. BLOCKED
"Shock the World!"
"Witness the Power of Street Knowledge!" https://g.co/kgs/n8oP4e 
@AnAmerican4 @POTUS Then join Trump and fight, quit the sore loser stuff.
He is for what u and ur followers were wanting, what is the problem????
Then fight with the majority and back Trump!!!
@CruzinAhead @POTUS Because POTUS doesn't care he is EVIL. #obamaworstpresidentEVER
Obama giving Iran 140 billion is suspect since they are the #1 state sponsor of terror including Isis! Impeach
the JV team is @POTUS and his administration.
@artnthesoul @POTUS Obama is our top terrorist !Obama is a dangerously ,scarey man.
***Radical Islamic Terrorists attack us and then @POTUS , democrat legislators, Hil-Liar-y and the MSM attack us! WTF?***
you know it is easier watching the SB then coaching in one... right? the GOP sez you are not capable of coaching... right
Remember, POTUS declared he would Fundamentally Change America--well, he has radically changed it.
That clown isn't even worthy of being called a JV president. Sooooo can't wait till he's out of office.
I would expect more from a senator than Fox News talking points!!!

Get a grip
All by design from within, because it appears, this admin HATES America, hates citizens.
@lubnel @POTUS Ted Cruz when u start  tellingUsYou'll start deporting mussies & destroying mosques,I'll vote 4 u for president.
Why are you sending this to POTUS???
Thanks to Republicans, we have this problem
Yes sir your right!
@CASEYANNETTE @POTUS If ISIS is the JV Team our Prez is Tee-Ball.

@realDonaldTrump is THE ONLY ANSWER.
Isis has done a good job of finding US born citizens who have been taught to hate people who are different!
@POTU We are also being attacked by homegrown terrorists who hate gays & people who are different than them! All were born in US
I never heard the GOP disagree with him
How would you have stopped this guy? I know you don't support denying him his constitutional right to a gun, so how?
@POTUSI want Obama to say on record he is not a Muslim.I want hear him say he is.saved by Jesus, since he says he is Christian.
the only attack we r under is frm u Sen Cruz and ur inability to work for your constituents
you're to blame since you and the @NRA allow "Radical Islamist Terrorists" to buy assault rifles!
don't give them credit, ISIS didn't coordinate, focus on lone wolf and kill the sources abroad swiftly.
one hell of a JV team
Hillary gets too much money from countries supporting terror. Obama gave 150 million. Obamas only enemy is us.
@twright55 but you guys won't help our nominee and enable Hillary to get in so we have more of this???????
religions have declared war on all thet don't conform.  https://criticalthought.me/story/guns-dont-kill-people-religions-kill-people/ …
Result of GOP in 1991 invading Kuwait to 'stop' their religious civil war of Shiites v Sunnis. GOP MidE failure #1
so who's the JV Team now?
No it isn't. Cops kill many more Americans than terrorists do.
Missed ur reading of Green Eggs & Ham last night on Senate floor. Still avoiding #DoYourJob ?
Now start supporting Trump..from an x Cruzer
Shame on Senator Cruz for this political crap in the wake of a national tragedy - I clearly see y Trump beat u.
Yep! @SenTedCruz @POTUS
Sen Cruz you are sounding dangerously similar to DT. 
Forget about radical Islam. We are going to be killing each other in the United States if Donald Trump is elected.
why don't you put on your Goldman jacket and go away from public service
cc:@POTUS
Thats Bcaz Republicans representing us remain deep in NRA pockets U cant see the light unless a #Filibuster.
another example of just out of touch he is. He has #Changed the country, and we are worse off for his 8 yrs.
I know that it irks you seeing @POTUS doing his job well, what a disappointment to see you using this for your personal politics
DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT
You love to hear yourself talk @SenTedCruz LISTENING is much better.America has had #Enough of easy access guns. This is not about IS @POTUS
attacked by American citizens.
Please help the GOP get together. We need to win or we'll have Hillary
wished you hadn't dropped out
Your right wing politics can wait until after the last victim has been buried. SMFH
And how do you stop it?  Democratic or republican policies will not stop a psychotic killer.  GROW UP
They're the varsity now, aren't they?
Religion Christian/Muslim are the problem. https://criticalthought.me/story/guns-dont-kill-people-religions-kill-people/ …

. @SenTedCruz #ImpeachObama
Sen.Cruz - Now is not the time to trash the President of the United States.  OUR nation is still in mourning. Grow up
Unfortunately We are mourning because  of Obama 
Failure as a President. 
Obama /Clinton gave us ISIS
Insane right wing comment.  If u must blame an American...How about George W Bush for Iraq which led to creation
Iraq started the war 
In the first place. Are you that young to remember? Bush didn't finish the job.
I have dual masters degrees in poly sci and history... quit watching fox news and get an education.
Cruz, you seem to be as hated in the Republican party as ISIS is in THIS country.  Please leave the stage.  You lost.
time to ban military weapons Ted.
agents first @SenTedCruz @POTUS
and we probably still don't have a strategy
