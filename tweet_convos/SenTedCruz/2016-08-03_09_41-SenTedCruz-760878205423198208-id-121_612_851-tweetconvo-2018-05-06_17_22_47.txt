The fact that the Obama admin paid #Iran $400M is one more piece of evidence that this ‘deal’ is illegitimate https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2754 …
agreed but then why would you let it get passed a republican congress???
RE: ZIKA, YOU YOUR DAMN JOB.
Ignorant or lying?? You know that the money was not, in fact, ransom money. But, hey, if everyone else is saying it...
that is what the Iranians are calling it so now after the "deal" we are not to trust the Iranians please
show me where the Iranians called it that
@BreitbartNews  fox news quoting from wallstreet journal I know they Don't get approval from dnc to run with it but hey
so I guess you can't back up your claim then, huh?
the self proclaimed constitutional atty, fell to fight for Supreme Court Justice fulfillment & for our conservative  principles.
backed out of the nomination fight & let the voice of us that supported him to be silenced by a bigger lyer than himself. TRUMP
And why is he still in office?
@simplylorilee it would be nice if you would get on board with the American people back Trump you lost fair and square
oh nevermind you were one of them children that was awarded even if you lost sorry you're a real American now
@WolfeGlenda ....like the "deal" to endorse our nominee ? #TCOT
Morning! He didn't say he wouldn't he said #NeverHillary. I wish DJT had not endorsed Ryan McCain stay out of locals
.@SenTedCruz Senator, how is Obama able to spend $400 million without Congressional approval?
same way the state department lost accountability for 4 billion dollars the was allocated to them
It was $6 Billion.
What is your "ripped to shreds action"?
400m could do so much good in the good ole USofA!!
Trying to destroy America one tweet at a time
@Catalinapby1 Congress hold the purse strings and does nothing but talk
cant something be done about this? This seems way crooked @Norsu2
@ChrisLoesch too bad we likely won't get a POTUS that'll do that.
what is your plan? You are a member of Congress. What are you sing about this? Tweeting? We need action. Write a Bill
Exactly how can the President spend this money w/o The Congress okay. Surely can't move it from one account to another
Then why mr. cruz are you supporting and endorsing Hillary Clinton? You have betrayed the Republican Party over prettiness
-Keep going after President Obama on this & do not STOP!
i voted for you.i trusted you. But you are in bed with the GOP. F.  K you n the GOP.
.@SenTedCruz Says the moaning Senator who's alienated everyone that can help him. People skills Teddy, people skills! Ineffective!
Darth Vader would be more of a humanitarian than Teddy! His rhetoric is more in line with a dictator!
@_CFJ_ so why is Cruz helping Hillary/Obama win?
Where did Obama get 4 million dollars?!!!
It's the Barbary Coast all over again
Disgusted w/our & balance of gov't
Is there no one willing to do the right thing Impeach
@michael300e It was never even signed off.
@ChrisLoesch ur the senator teddy,do something & stop talking about it.
Mr Cruz, sir, why did you seek money from the DNC?
WikiLeaks docs show Cruz campaign asked DNC for funding! #LyingTed 
#CruzCrew #NeverCruz #LyingTed #Cruz 
work with democrats on the policies u feels is important & find a new support. Congressional  Republicans dont support his ideas
What a DISGRACE. https://twitter.com/emrutherford90/status/760972957439053828 …
explain to me which branch controls spending!
If the RNC dumps Trump, where does that leave you @SenTedCruz since you did not concede or endorse him?
Give me a break.. You financed it...
another Obama lie
That would have been a "great idea"... before Congress funded the deal. Now? It's a meaningless gesture...
.@SenTedCruz @ProfessorF Let the Iranians break the deal.They will cheat, possibly by not doing something. Catch them.
keep going Senator...a voice like no other
You could've done that yourself if you'd won the presidency. Too bad only Christo-fascists vote for you
In the #WH media room, which intern is first to LOL at a Cruz tweet? #ObamaOwnsCongress. They control the "purse strings" #tcot
Amen!
@LouDobbs So far, you are the ONLY one that doesn't lie & will apologize ON TV if you are wrong.
@Radiomattrick We elected you to take care of these problems. Unless you want me to take your place, get it done!! @JudgeTedPoe
@dexybailman did the Treasury not violate its own BSA/AML laws? This seems egregious & treasonous & merits a deep investigation.
-@BarackObama and @HillaryClinton should both be in prison for treason
@SenTedCruz
@colavs2184 Here's @WhiteHouse press briefing from January 17 on this exact topic. GET REAL
Yes it should be stopped! That is why America has to stop four more years of Obama nonsense! Vote Trump!!
@CapitaLiszt what's in it for us?  Nothing!
Please do everything you can to arrest him for his treason! We can't hand the country over to the enemy!
what we do now sir?
@ThinkSayGo can't American people use this money 1st?
typical Ted all talk  no action! Don't you have a flight 2catch aboard Air Force One? Conservative my arse #VoteYourConscience
@SenTedCruz
then I suggest you and the rest of the GOP do something and start ripping. Running your mouths on Twitter is not effective.
This nation needs you sir. President Ted Cruz.
oh darn it, I forgot to un follow you, bye bye
your words do not matter, it does not mean anything
Why didn't you weaklings say/do this when you could have?
it reminds me of the Brits back in 1938 when they thought that Adolf Hitler can be trusted,
Well then Ted… it's time to get on board with Donald J Trump bc he's our only chance to stop the insanity! U lost! Get over it!
Pride comes before the fall. Vote Trump/Pence 2016
I agree Ted but what are you and Congress going to do about it?!
It's no deal w/o Senate approval.
I AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT
maybe it's time to reach out to Trump and start helping
Well jump in here and giddy up!  Instead if yak yak, do something. Endorse DJT, millions will rally by you.
لعنت به این قرار داد که هیچ سودی برای مردم نداشته
You're all so full of shit!  Obama gave them nothing. That was Iran's money being withheld and then released back to them. Facts
you were nothing more than Donald Trump with an Ivy League education
howaboutbacking your partysnomination and give him the chance toreverse and to protect constitutioni voted for u ted get over it
Once we start paying human trafficking will run wild. We to not begin to negoc. Hunt them down & settle the matter w strength.
irrelevant #NeverRubioCruzRyan
BUT, @realDonaldTrump STARTED A JOKE.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Ted no one is listen to you since you screwed up. What can you do to be relevant, get on the Ttrain
If only the presidential nominee who vowed to do that received the endorsement of others, @SenTedCruz. If only.
you knew about it at the time. No point complain today for political points, where was your congressional oversight back then?
They already broke the deal. So forget them.

It was Iran's$ from 1979 deal, publicly settled Jan'16. Nothing secret/Not ransom. GOP diverting Trump mess

.@joshledermanAP @OKnox Yes. @POTUS spoke 2 settlement in Jan 17 address. & @JohnKerry issued standalone statement! 
Yet another bullshit comment from Ted. I am not a democrat or republican fan. But Ted your a bullshit artist.
Maybe you can help me get a car. Looking for donations to this organization. http://www.800charitycars.org/compare-car-donation-programs.html …
We're paying ransoms? Iran's chief cleric is renouncing the nuclear deal?  What is Obama doing to us?  Hillary's another term.
It was the Iranian,s own we were holding since 1970  as the head
       of  Iran was friend,s with America  It was their money
.@SenTedCruz Since when does the US government "fly in bundles of cash"?
This is beyond INFURIATING but focus of the MSM today is if @realDonaldTrump asked about nukes?
The sheriff it up and never never give them any money at all no ransom payout
nothing will happen b/c of spineless GOP. MAYBE we should vote Trump. He doesn't just bend over like you guys in congress
the Tea Party is dead Ted. A failed experiment.
لماذا تقتلون الشعب اليمني 
You're right, Ted. Now go fix the BS you started at the convention. We the people have spoken. Acquiesce and follow our will.
we are funding terrorism 
Good job! American values should never be signed away! 

Cruz for Senate majority leader!
#Now man up and find out how this happened under the noses of Congress and the Senate?
And voting for Trump is the only hope of that happening. Ready to back him yet, or do you see 8 more yrs of this shit as OK???
yawn..."par for the course " did we expect anything different from obama, it will be the same with hillary
so should you!
was it owed since 1979 jackass!
It should be...where is everyone?
And the Establishment Dem-like RINO Senate will do nothing. McConnell is no leader.

republican Presidemt would have been impeached already
You lost to an orange monkey.
