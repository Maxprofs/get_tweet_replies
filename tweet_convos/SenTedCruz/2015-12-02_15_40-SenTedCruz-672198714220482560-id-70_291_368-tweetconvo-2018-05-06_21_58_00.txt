@SenTedCruz Kate's Law not effective because overcrowded prisons filled with a majority of illegal aliens.
@SenTedCruz $6.5B not enough money to to round up illegal aliens, even having a "smart" way of doing it.

@SenTedCruz You don't show that much respect for the law when talking about abortion.

@SenTedCruz cannot indefinitely detain illegals who's home country will not accept them for deportation
@SenTedCruz "we are not sacrificing children when deporting convicted aliens" translates to anchor babies worth more than life and law.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS to me you are charged w/ fighting for the @GOP and not the american people and the same can be said for the Dems #USELESS
@SenTedCruz Since you glorify small gov't, I'd expect you to applaud this use of prosecutorial discretion. Let's focus on violent offenders.

@SenTedCruz @POTUS Mr President, please undo their deeds/
@SenTedCruz good point. All @POTUS does is break laws but expects this entitled generation to not do the same. #Impeachment
@towens54 @SenTedCruz @POTUS GOP has both houses of Congress but no cojones.
@mitchlreynolds @POTUS agreed. The only one that will stand by himself and fight for what is right is @SenTedCruz
@towens54 @POTUS @SenTedCruz You mean the one that will pose, then cut and run. Would Cruz ask Congress to raise debt ceiling?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Not true. The Executive branch has historically had latitude in enforcement of laws made by Congress.
@SenTedCruz that includes laws about abortion ted
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Thank you sir. Keep standing for us please
@SenTedCruz @POTUS And what is the Congress prepared to do to make that happen???

@SenTedCruz @POTUS Gees I hope rafael is the nominee... Hillary will eat him for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
AMEN @SenTedCruz  the #Constitution is absolute, the rule of law, to be #followed, and not to be selectively dictated by the president

@SenTedCruz @POTUS "If the President does it, it isn't illegal." Nixon or Obama said that?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS how about you do something about these mass shootings? Instead of abortion, help actual people. Be pro life as you say.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I would be starting to ask the question .. Do you like living in this new obamaland?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS this dammit. If an official does not enforce the law then they should be removed.
