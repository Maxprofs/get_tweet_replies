Fucking hell, now think about Donald Trumps media coverage, then this breakthrough in global politics. DIGRACEFUL
TH MEDIA IS DEAD.  its misinformation, only misinformation, cant be trusted at all, any of it. MEDIA SUICIDE
IMAGINE IF HILLARY HAD GOT IN !  end of the world. no truth, assange assasinated, war ! war!  war! Whore of Babs!
SORRY GOT THAT TOTTALY WRONG, HE IS SUPPORTING THE ISRALIES,  what do i know anyway. NUFFING! LOL
the UN was supposed to be a conference room for nations to meet. It has become a governing body and must therefore be dismantled.
well hold off there. We need some middle ground. It's kept peace
is he some sort of dick, this is what happens when you move too much to the right and steal occupied land, somethings got to give.
Israel is not occupied land. That is their nation.
what nation expands 'their land' by stealing land that is not theirs?  It's like US expanding south by taking Mexico
When they were attacked by every surrounding nation in 1967 & fought them off those nations gave up those lands.
So we're living in the middle ages where lands are conquered, people ruled over forcefully whether they like or not
When 'those ppl' chose to declare war on Israel in 1948 & 1967 with plan to annihilate them, then yes.
So a new generation that wasn't involved still pay the price and live under occupation, what a world we live in.
You act as if we should go back in some point in time and relocate ppl to where prior borders existed. Give Tx back to Mx?
get rid of them we the taxpayers don't want one cent going to these pigs
Thanks for growing a pair Ted! Where was this brashness in the primaries?
@tedcruz Can someone explain why we care about UN condemning Israel?  The settlements r illegal.
I will explain. It is there land. They have a right to build houses.
No. it's occupied land. They went beyond their borders in the 1960's.Took Gaza strip, w bank etc.
When surrounding nations declared war on Israel in 1967 they forfeited those lands.
was the loss of their own land! Quite simple and JUST!
Wasn't it was Palestine that loss land? Why is it called occupied? Why UN think it's illegal?
There was never a nation of Palestine.
To have held back for so long in the hopes for peace is a mistake...
Agreed and Amen to that!
@usuallyrite Better defund State now too
@tedcruz Stupid thinking from Cruz - Israel should be censured. Settlements need to stop if serious about peace. Cruz cluess! @CNN
Oh, yes, we must defund them to stand with Israel.  How sick is it for us to do bad things to Israel? Must support israel
Yes also support Syria and the Congo! Right?
Yes, defunding our only conflict resolution mechanism is the perfect way to resolve international crisis.
@Gunnerguy1911 And do it quickly! Move them to Brussels since there will be office space there very soon!
Please get them out of our country too! #UNnewhomelybia!
Ted Cruz is an asskissing suckup.
They are our only Democratic ally in the Middle East. Every other nation wishes Israel & US death. Wake up.
Sheer silliness. A mature response would be to acknowledge that Israel is breaking international law and agreements.
Quite the opposite.
Huh? People allow their support for Israel to blot out plain facts, facts the rest of the world can see.
Do you mean the facts as represented by anti-Semite Islamic nations which control the UN?
Wow, it's worse than I thought, straight to irrational attacks on Islam. Carry on, reason has no sway here.
Facts are what they are. It is Islamic nations who call for the annihilation of Israel, not the other way around.
Islam calls for the enslavement or murder of ALL that don't accept the Prophet & Allah.
False, but you make my point completely. This is about religious prejudice, not facts.
->
 Israel Is Nothing More Than A Spoiled Welfare-Baby -> The U.S. Taxpayer Doesn't Owe Them One Penny -
it's in our best interest to support our best ally in the Middle East. If that takes money or military we need them
These people siding with Israel are fool Do you think you can achieve peace by imposition? No ways, it has to be 2 states solution
2 state solution not possible given palistinian terrorism and constant hostility. Isreal always advocated for peace.
I still believe strongly! Peace can be achieved! I still believe the 2 parties can love each other unconditionally!
difficult if not impossible under current circumstances.Can one negotiate w another calling for your death and total destruction?
Continued occupation of Israel also jeopardizing the 2 states solution. Let's not deceive ourselves, if you keep occupying
what middle  eastern state offers religious freedoms to all other then Isreal?
how does freedom of religion fits into the equations of having human dignity? To me the last time I checked, they fit not
Trump is Obama 2.0 and Bill KKKlinton 3.0
I'm with Cruz on this one. Hmmm! Let me think. What country was Jesus born in??
Lying Ted you're a joker history will remember your legacy as FOOL who read CAT IN HAT. Foolish man now hush
United States first! Stop worshiping Israel over God.
Thank you Senator Cruz for always standing with Israel and being a true friend to them. God bless you in Jesus Name.
NO FALSE HALVIES COMPROMISES!!!  DEPORT AND DEFUND THE ISLAMIC UN!!!
@coinabs Absolutely!  The UN has become an impediment to peace instead of a proponent.
@peddoc63 Hello? Remember before Trump won and he said the same thing people went bat shit crazy.
A-MEN!!!!!
IMPEACH HUSSEIN OBAMA NOW!!!!  Before he can slide out of office unaccountable!! - This attack on US too!
I think Congress should be de-funded.
@tedcruz can't anything be done to stop Obama until after Jan 20?  Stop him.
Thank you Senator Cruz, Obama's hand has been played - Muslim!
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz is stupid
@tedcruz I agree!
# agree with Ted 100% - time to defund
@ninanu11 He better take stand for something, this back stabber. Thats reason all Cap hill, dis like him. He goes with flow.
@realDenaldTrump @KellyannePolls @tedcruz  I HOPE THIS ISN'T JUST FOR EFFECT  UN VICIOUS GANG OF DESPOTS THIEVES US-HATERS OUT!!!
@SenTedCruz Must be something in it for this dumbass. Defund everything?  You're such a rat bastard
@tedcruz yes defund and get out of the UN.

@tedcruz @chrisenloe I'm with you the UN is hypocritical attacking Israel
Republicans love to bash the UN, but the UN didn't make the UK, Japan, Russia, China,& France, vote 4 the resol'n. They chose to!
The American people stand behind the new administration and want America to be great again. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump can be great
@Lynn_Rose1 I agree
@tedcruz
@tedcruz
@SenTedCruz such an extremist. You throw a hissy fit when someone disagrees with you
This is WAY past due !!!
@tedcruz Do you know about those sunken Isreali subs off the coast of NY ? What was that about ? #webleedpurple
Cruz is nothing but the King of Drama....
@tedcruz do you ever shut up?? nobody cares..
.@theblaze @tedcruz #NaySay Teddy has a way of being wrong side for these things.
What's the Right Side? Throwing Israel under the bus again?
How about the rule of law Teddy so fond of when it suits him.
The Congress approves All Funding. That's Rule of Law.
.@airwolf1967 @theblaze @tedcruz Actual only the House can initiate funding. land capture by war can not be built on is also Rule of law.
The Senate can still block Funding. Last time I checked Land won by War is yours to do with as you please.
Best check again https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_Israeli_settlements …
I with the Israelis on this one. International Law is a joke . The Land belongs to Israel. Period.
Yes! WE AGREE! Thank you Ted! @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions @SEN @GOPoversight @GOPSenFinance @Reince
Ted Cruz is wrong on the facts and the policy. Just another senator acting irresponsibly on foreign-policy issues.
@SenTedCruz Defund UN! Y are people surprised.Obama is a Muslim & Admin belongs 2 Brotherhood of Muslims. OBAMA hates USA & Jews.
@tedcruz They hate Israel & America except for our $!
So much for American democracy & it's interest! It's about time #Palestinians get to live a normal life not just selected few!
Money the US gives to the corrupted nations (UN) is used against Israel. So why give this corrupt body anything
Trump should face a press conference
@tedcruz Thank you, Senator Cruz! Defund UN & kick them out! Let Trump turn UN into condos & we will make $$$ instead of lose $$
We should DEFUND The UN and PLANNED PARENTHOOD! Planned Parenthood is just LEGAL HUMAN ORGAN HARVESTING & Moloch Gifts
Stand behind what you believe and never give in just to stal relevant in politics
https://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/GPF_Dangerous_Partnership_Full_report.pdf …
EVERYDAY I WISH THAT THIS GUY WAS MY SENATOR.
sorry you can't have him.  He is ours... but Texas would love to have you.
:) @CameronLeeKirs1 @theblaze
@SenTedCruz it looks like Cruz is #antiAmerica #corrupt #traitor we see where your loyalty stands
@SenTedCruz it will be cheaper to move Israel to the US
@SenTedCruz No Two State Solution Now!
Who are your working for Ted?
@tedcruz #I would be interested knowing how Jews feel about this that voted for Obama ?
Heres a bold stand of my own: Ted Cruz should move to Israel if hes going to put right wing Israel nut interests over US interests
@SenTedCruz 
@SenTedCruz I agree
#DefundUN use $ build the wall
Why the call for a vote, if they don't like the outcome?
@tedcruz defend Israel. 38 billion this year!
@SenTedCruz we must take a stand for Israel
Tired of you, son.
Defund Isreal for violations of the 4th Geneva Accords.
@tedcruz absolutely right. Send the UN to Russia
@tedcruz Ah yes the next President of the US. Cant wait till 2020. 
@tedcruz Agreed!! No one outside the country should tell any country where not to build. The housing benefits everyone's needs.
Yeah ted, because we should react to an organisation telling someone to act within the law, by making them struggle.
@dixiefortrump
OK, but watch your six around cruz
@tedcruz Defund it.
get out of the UN would be better, I don't care about Israel.
We Irish have been unthinking supporters of UN but I now wonder whether any good UN does outweighs harm & cost.
JERUSALEM http://jerusalem.com/photos/gallery/jesus_on_the_cross_jerusalem-p180 …
@tedcruz do it, PLEASE
@tedcruz Thank you Senator Cruz for standing strong and making the case to defund the UN. Changes are coming!
Not only defund but send it packing to some radical third world country!   #GetTheUNOutOfTheUnitedStates
Impact with you Senator .
This is why we love @tedcruz!  Keep up the great work!
@tedcruz Agree!
@tedcruz Funny that Ted has no problem with all of the Anti-Israel UN votes under Repub. Presidents since Reagan. #CrocadileTears

@tedcruz Yes!!!!!!!!
@tedcruz One more thing abolish the UN. In The United States. They stand for nothing
@tedcruz Yes , Right for defunding , can't  be anti Israel and pro American ! If they're against Israel they're  against America.
@tedcruz I agree the UN stands for nothing

Fuck Cruz
@tedcruz Sen. Ted Cruz has proven he is a coward...see how he reacted to Trump before/after election.
How about Vlad while you're at it.
@tedcruz only guy worse than Trump is.
PLEASE...HE JUST WANT TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT
George Soros will pick up the tab though.
@pat_jordan UN is made up of taking heads living off the poor people of their country
@tedcruz this fig doesn't know what he is talking abt. He has Zero knowledge abt. World  politics! Get lost flip flop get real!!!
@tedcruz Deport Cruz to Israel.

Fuck Israel! Take care of your own yard before complaining about the neighbors.
Pay for their move to Rwanda.
@tedcruz yes! We should do that ASAP!

UNITED ARAB STATES
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/24/lefties-marching-aleppo-stop-war/ …  Can we get this in the USSA? Love to see Michael Moore leading the way.
Israel lives with a Sword of Damocles hanging over its head. The islamic nations deny their right to even exist, before any fight
Agreed.

UN is waaaaay past its Best Before Date.

Defund it, them it either reforms or does.
@real_vt16 yes! Defund UN!
Outrageous Suggestion!  Get a Grip - - Chicken-Little!  Abstention by U.S., subtle signal Israel's Netti; that he is to inflexible
Ted!!!Just do it !!!!
@tedcruz he's a bafoon and idiot. Smh
why is this tool still talking, it's like listening to Sarah Palin, when will they just crawl away from the spotlight
UN is just a bureaucratic waste of money. The Donald will figure this out.
Ted, This is the most sense you've made in quite a while!! @theblaze
He's always made sense. Only ppl who don't listen think otherwise.
Were the other nations stupid or US was the "Mr.Right"?
@tedcruz You tell em Ted
US always wants to support Israel whether  wrong or right. Must you veto everything? Must you be the bad guy all the time? Common!
To defund the United Nations was your solution? No wonder you were not elected as the United States President!
Lyin Ted Cruz. Washington's most hated polititian. The Jews will be just fine. Trump said he would fix it. Ted siding with Trump?
#TedCruz DAMN STRAIGHT!
why defund it our dumbasses let it happen. Jan 20th changes the rules of the game
IM IN ON THAT! There's no telling what Obama, the Muslim terrorist lover will do bf leaving WH...THANK GOD WE DONT HAVE LONG. .
I agree
US just needs end its relationship with UN
time go break out Obamas UN. Stop the money to them.
Fuck Israel. They are a bunch of welfare state terrorists themselves. Let them finance their own ME war machine.
Way overdue. This organization is an anti west sham. Move it to Brussels next to EU...they are a perfect couple.
The UN is antisemitic & anti-American!  One look at Syria and it tells you it's a failed, corrupt, irrelevant institution!

Now just do it.
Yes to that #DefundUN
Cruz isn't the only one
@tedcruz finally Cruz says something we can agee on. Why haven't you been making things happen the last several years??!!
cause McConnell and the rest of the Establishment block every great move he makes. Cruz and Lee only 2 left!
Cruz is NOT great in any form or shape! If he's your guy that's good for you, but I have no use 4 him!
only senator that stood to defend Obama care. Everyone but Mike Lee sat on their ass!!
again I ask, why do we need the U.N? Isn't it time we realize being in the U.N is not in our best interest?
#abolishtheUN now
@SteveSGoddard Just defund The UN. They claim they don't need US money @UN
Defund? Take it a step further @tedcruz, U.N. needs to be fully abolished!
How about the US withdrawing from UN and hq relocating to Geneva. U exaggerate US importance to the world!
follow Ted Cruz straight to hell !!
defund Israel and the UN
completely agree!!
http://www.forwardprogressives.com/ted-cruz-demands-repeal-federal-law-doesnt-exist/ …
