Are you taking the test too?! What about the rest of those who created this bill?
I don't take government money!
Oh not you, lol! That was for Ted Cruz!
he won't respond!
Oh absolutely he will not. Many of these politicians can't debate unless they have prep because they rarely ever read or know their bills
Had a friend who grew up in the projects. He said moms sold food stamps 4 1/2 amount in cash to by drugs/ kids were hungry. DRUG TESTING YES
Yes...i also knew ppl who's parents exchanged them to buy cigarettes and alcohol.  Def.. Drug testing.  #MAGA
Yes!   That will save u.s. A lot of $$
Are You putting the same testing on Welfare?????
Thank you. Why does it take good ole common sense? Something I feel is lost in Washington!
YesCruz!  Lets make sure chikdren if ill parents lose financial support to feed/shelter/cloth their children. Moral moran
Wonderful. Most workers have to pas a drug test to get a job. If tax payers are paying $ make sure they are work eligible.
How about Welfare, food stamps and Medicaid? I have to submit to a drug screen to keep my job.Use my tax money to test the collectors!
Think how many would fail! Money well spent as far as I'm concerned!
Will this include #drug #testing for #congress?
Since welfare recipients are drug tested so should #congress
You and the rest of OUR elected officials need to be tested too.
Great!  Discriminating against the poor is easy... now let's pass one to drug test all of the @GOP house and @Senate to see if they use?
why not the Dems, as well?
Fine with me but the @dems should never put a bill up like this...
riiiight....they don't want to offend/alienate their voting base....
You mean the republicans?
no, the Dems - junkies, stoners & other worthless, non-contributing Dems...
Good.
Yeah that will be challenged in courts
Jerk
Great idea. Test them every two 2 wks thereafter. This should apply 2 any type of Fed. welfare payments.
Hey" while your at this drug testing the poor how about drug testing people on Capitol Hill?
Please, oh please!!!  I am sure there would be many open seats after that.
@dallasnews @jslovegrove More government waste courtesy of the @GOP - well done #lyingted!
Need to include welfare benefits!
Awesome, great job!!!! Long time coming. THANK YOU!!
How many drugs did @tedcruz take before he made calls for @realDonaldTrump after he insulted his wife and dad? I'd have been stoned too Ted
Not until we drug test every government employee being paid with my taxes (you included). I'd like random breathalyzer tests too.
#LoseCruz2018
there's no vindictive bill that doesn't attract you guys like flies.  did you take a drug test when you did your belly flop into politics?
This has already been proven to cost vastly more $ than it saves. Why are you still pursuing  this?
I would rather pay for drug testing for House & Senate R's, they are the ones who keep ending up in awkward situations.
They should start drug testing MOC, too.
Thanks for wasting money for something that is completely ineffective! Conservative values at work!
@dallasnews @jslovegrove waste of money. Beto2018!
Good.  Lets see how much cash the #Texas taxpayers save. I would say oh lets see...millions.
When do we get to drug test you? Need to stigmatize the unemployed more, huh?
#youlie I thought you guys in the #gop were all about saving money?
This is a proven waste! 
#dnc #POTUS
So, folks lost jobs-r eligible 2 apply & receive unemp b/c job loss nt their fault & still U want 2 check 'em 4 drugs. Competing 4 meanness?
SCOTUS will strike it down. I'll remind U about this in the future. Invasion of privacy since applicants aren't getting benefits yet.
How bout expanding it to ALL GVT benefit programs? If a person has their hand out, well they need to be held accountable. Period
And we need that for people on welfare as well
Great! It is time for this to happen.
YES!!!
Should drug test for welfare too.
I hope so! @SenTedCruz is bad for the country, so I know he's horrible for Texas!!
FANTASTIC
For every unemployed person that passes a drug test to receive benefits, you should be held responsible to reimburse the costs of the test
Instead of combating poverty, let's go to war with the poor.
It's been proven to cost tax payers more money.
If you wanted to save tax payers money you'd pass #MedicareForAll and cut out the middleman.
Now if we could get them to drug test congress...
Should go for college professors who take Fed government money next.
This is exactly what Jesus would do.
What a waste of tax money.
You have no shame, after trump said those barbaric things about your wife and father

You do realize this costs tons of money, is ineffective & wasteful plus adds layers to bureaucracy? So much for smaller govt lmfao
About time
Are we going to drug test congress people, the president & his advisers? Trump definitely seems like he is on drugs & we all know Bannon is.
"we all"?....i don't know that...
Thank you Sir you are awesome #cruz2020 or #cruz2024
Lose your job, then have to lose your dignity so a testing company gets richer.
Now for a bill to drug test #Congress #Senate & @POTUS who will have a much higher percentage test positive for drugs.
Congrats
Why not include Govt/taxpayer funded entitlement?
Too revolutionary?
Trump change
Meaning states will get hit with more costs than anything saved A matter already proven
Costs too much. Does too little.
Thanks Ted,...A Cuban/Canadian hero to all and none...So brave,
Wasting more tax payer money on a nonexistent issue.

And if there is an addict on unemployment? Starve or imprison them instead of rehab?
Can we have one to drug test congress? I'm betting you won't. @CNN @MSNBC
Yet another reason you must go.
SERIOUSLY, I want to know what you're smoking.
