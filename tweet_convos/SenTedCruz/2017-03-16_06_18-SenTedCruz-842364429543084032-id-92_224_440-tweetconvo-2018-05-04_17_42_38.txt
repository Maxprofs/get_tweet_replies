I try2 tell Leftists,but they refuse 2 believe.
Keep speaking the truth; a few at least are seeing the light. This site has some good resources
.@SenTedCruz perhaps you're not getting the job done because the AHCA cuts taxes for the rich while increasing costs for the poor & elderly?

...leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other involves orcs.
Disregard the name; the statement stands on its own.
I'm still waiting for why you think I'm a socialist. Because I'm arguing with @SenTedCruz about market principles?
Amen. That's what it sounds like I'm getting from the House leadership.

offering people the option of buying leveraged insurance?
Define leveraged insurance?
Government health care no matter its form is Socialism.
is the U.S. military socialist or communist?
but you can ignore the millions of people who will go uninsured with the new plan?
I'm republican democrat don't want me trumph do right things
Democrat socialist don't want republican do the right thinks
I certainly hope your personal goal isn't simply to repeal, but also includes an actual, viable replacement.
His goal is personal enrichment & elimination of poor, sick,elderly. U know, like Jesus would do....
His goals won't be relevant after 2018, this is when the people of Texas will vote him out.
I don't care if we repeal & replace, or simply improve ObamaCare, but give us good coverage @ lower premiums/deductibles.
voters didn't want this, you want this, you want to destroy anything more popular than you are.
If you are in Texas, much of that increase occurred because the state government refused to expand medicaid.

And obviously no leftist ever composed any such list. Please stop shadow-boxing; we need to work on real issues.
Oh dear friend absolutely they did...
@BritHume says #Obamacarerepeal blame on Freedom Caucus & Sens. Lee, Cruz & Paul, who want to lead COTUS GOP to another political dead-end
please work together thats how the dems did it.
FULL REPEAL! Then bill to reduce healthcare costs. Medicare for hospitalization, economic transparency, interstate ins
Wouldn't matter; too many economic illiterates want something for nothing and too many kept politicians want to keep the status quo.
tort reform will never happen 90% of politicians are lawyers they are cutting they're salieries of there friends
Repeal and Replace. You forgot about: Replace. Don't rush this and make a mess, don't let bully Trump get you in a hammerlock.
Twenty years in social services seen plenty of waste in money
The @GOP plan lets Americans die who would live through ACA. We know you're not actually pro-life, @SenTedCruz It's just a gimmick you use!
might help if you plan didn't suck eggs
What do you know about the @SenTedCruz plan?
a fair amount...he is unfortunately my Senator. I have a fundamentally different set of values.
what ever can be done without Democrats do it! Even if not perfect do something!

either way Obama care is done it will collapse on its# own
remember the middle class of Texans on Obama care repeal and replace
@potus #federal money #stopped to those breakung the law
@msnbc @WSJ  Teddy Roosevelt suggested we have Universal Health Care in US in 1914. GOP & Dems had 103 years to fix the problem
you need to listen to us, your constituents.  Most of us actually LIKE Obamacare.
I can Sen.Crua,  p.ryan, j.mccain, j.flake, power greedy Reps.and Senators. They don't have to have this bocare,DUMP
gov't isn't the entity to fix this. Get insurers, AMA, hospitals, pharm, etc together and get them to come up with a plan
you are a #failure that supports #traitor #shame on you @tedcruz
@conserv_tribune what ever happened to all those special groups that were except from obcare. Put them on the AHCA plan.
you are as great an honest senator.  thank you
Keep fighting!!! I can't believe your So called colleagues!???
This is a good, sensible start.  I don't agree with the Medicaid piece.  Some able bodied are not able minded.  Let's talk.
Take out the garbage! Drain the swamp!
Senators were supposed to set work rules for the GOOD OF AMERICA, not for their personal benefit or their families.
Thank you Senator! You are a light in a dark land.
Repeal only - Do. Not. Replace! Let the Free Market take back this product and get government out of it!
no one has explained why we need a replacement.  In clear simple plan language explan  why obamacare isn't working!
obviously you are not listening to the voters!
This is not about you or president Trump, it's about American Tax payers, so stop the rhetoric  fix it.
The voters sent one message, the Electoral collage another.  #NoToTed2018
what kind of excuse can you give? Maybe your top guy and his henchman suck at their respective jobs?
There is no excuse!
support #RandPaul bill. Add tools to reduce healthcare costs. Transparency costs. Offer Medicare for purchase and for poor
You don't want to give voters a town hall
Give is what you nonworking sorry politicians have for health coverage.. that a fix
I wish people would Stop saying Repeal & Replace. NO REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY.  Let the Free Market work  #FULLREPEAL .@HouseGOP
free market didn't work before. Very few could get insurance prior to Obamacare.
like it but what is your plan for pre existing conditions?
How about "we couldn't come up with anything better than #ACA ?" That seems to be what you've discovered.
This is the time for you people to separate yourself from the corrupt crowd in the Senate & Congress. We are tired of excuses!
Not an expert by far, but it seems that if they push too much, the Dems will fight it till they die, and further delay
it doesn't deserve to get through!
Opponents to Trump's plan cite 14M will be without health care. 13M of those will be deported aliens so not bad
More voodoo math
I pray for UNITY of MIND to #RepealAndReplace, UNITY not fight! Do not be weary but break the strongholds of control in Congress
Isaiah 30:12
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm we have been waiting for you to act for several years Teddy why the sudden change? The Trump bandwagon???
Keep fighting Senator; we're counting on you
Get it done
Everybody needs to understand the major problems with the #ACA. It's not a real HEALTHCARE bill, it's a heath insurance bill.
@SpeakerRyan Sen. Cruz is right.  Follow his lead and get the job done right.  Use Pence as the chair of the Senate.
Someone needs to bring all parties together and clean up mess.  AHCA looks like it's falling apart.  Shame on GOP.
Where's the health care plan for your victims?
#ZodiacConfirmed
Exactly... it would be better the bill never passes than have it just screw things up. Let obamacare implode.
Use Auto Ins as baseline for Health Care, Ins Co choices, deduct, coverage choices. Get it together @SenateGOP
look at the last 8 years, couldn't get anything done & can't get anything done now
How can you talk about controlling health care costs without the mention of "tort reform"?
2550 days since ACA signed

And this the best the @GOP could do for America?

#TRUMPCARE

Make America Genocidal Again
R's need to stop playing politics in front of the cameras.  That is exactly why we put Trump in.  Stay off the television.
@realDonaldTrump ran on repeal and replace. Not sure what @SpeakerRyan doesn't understand. Step 1 repeal - not water down.
Whatever decided,it cant be leaving those who were forced to buy ACA w/o ins options.Get rid of Med Exp,open up markets,inc jobs
"the job" is 2-fold. Repeal & replace promised by some of ur colleagues. I agree with with repeal only, but u need more votes.
But you can LIE through your teeth about how the 24 million people you'll screw over will somehow be better off.
@RMConservative @WSJ What is enraging the soon-2-be former GOP base is the GOP's embrace of a Socialist/Obama entitlement.
The civil war is being fought in the congress.  It's time to fight or surrender. And surrender is not an option. We must win.
You've had 6 years to come up with a replacement or fix the ACA. Don't you dare repeal it without a viable replacement ready.
Ahh the repeal legalization has an effective date two years future. Try setting aside the emotion & use common sense @SenTedCruz
The repeal legislation shouldn't exist until the replacement is ready to roll out. I'd rather they fix the ACA.
The @SenTedCruz plan is not Socialism like ACA but free market reforms that take time to implement. America land of the FREE!
The ACA isn't socialism? It's free market reform???? Where do you get your info? Because it's wrong.
Why does it mandate people buy insurance, mandate what the policies cover, and expand Medicaid outright providing care for many?
All of those things are Socialism and have nothing to do with free markets.
Yes....repeal ObamaCare....but why replace it?? #NoGovCare
agreed!!! Why not just let #WeThePeople take care of ourselves
I'm believing Pres. Trump's team WILL get it right....3 phases..
No. But you could give them what they WANT. Fix what's wrong with Obamacare. DO NOT REPEAL IT. #anotherrussiansympathizer
we hv given u the house, the senate & the WH. If @GOP lets us down there will b hell to pay
thank you Mr Cruz!!
