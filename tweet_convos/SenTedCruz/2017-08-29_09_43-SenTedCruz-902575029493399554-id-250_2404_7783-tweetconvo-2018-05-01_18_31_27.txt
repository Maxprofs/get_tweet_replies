Thank God.  It is nice to see people getting actual help.
You're welcome!
This is what aid looks like, rather than what the clintons did for haiti
Hat's off to our military!
A bit late don't you think? Should be thanking first responders and civilians for taking matters into their own hands. Still cutting fema?
Don't feed the BOT #PutinBot  @TeaPainUSA


Is it possible for you to focus on your job and stay off Twitter Mr. President???  Spare us the twitter updates and get Houston back online!
No shit. Just do ur job president-elect Trump!
William Ezrin--
I am not sure how  old your post is but Mr. Trump is President now and I voted for him as did many many Americans.  No shit.
@Impeach_D_Trump I refer to him as president-elect because he'll never be my president. The fact that you refer to him as king says it all!
Well duh
God Bless those guys & girls!
GREAT JOB...FAST RELIEF...thank you President @realDonaldTrump
Yes they are the heroes here first responders and volunteers and all 
Gov comes in for funds
This is always done in any relief effort, all president do this and gov agencies

SO PROUD
Not sure this is our RL pres but I need your help I'd it is please

Don't be so mean  to Mexico, they offered to help Texas while  you pick on them. Make friends, allies, NO WALL , it isn't needed.
I heard that helicopter was flown by a transgender pilot.  PS how's your buddy Mueller getting on?

Should be sending tetnus vacinations also .

TY @POTUS FOR THE SUPER FAST RESPONSE.. UNLESS G. BUSH JR.
Excellent job , if it were Muslims, Mexicans Nd phillipinos, ud have used ox carts instead of black Hawks, feel sad for citizens though,
If this was Obama he would be apologising to the hurricane for people being in the way.
God Bless the US Military, the Blackhawks & Pres. Trump & all the Americans who've pitced in to help in relief efforts or contributed.


The wrap job on that pallet is 
Did you resist grabbing those boxes whether they wanted it or not?
Fly high, safe travels!

Inflatable boats.....MADE IN CHINA.
Thank You Texas Military, God Bless America!
I guess a fed bail out is ok when it doesn't involve the East Coast, right Raphael?
That's a pretty cool picture
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  Meanwhile . . .
I killed all those people

A normal action of any responsible government. Does not assuage underlying problem.

I thought this was a side picture of copter in a video game lol

The fact that @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS represent us in the world is one of the saddest realities of my lifetime.
BLACKHAWK RULES!!!!!!

Hablar en privado. 
Food Town in Channelview charging 26.00 bucks for case of water, so much for the community coming together to help.
Awesome! God Bless those in need! Happy to see supplies headed to many!

Praise God! Thank you for all you do! 
Doing something very small after hard working locals did the real work. Are u claiming credit for the lives saved? Glory grabber.. smh sad
Hallelujah for help. Now they need some comfortable place and dry clothes
Opening more shelters yet? I pray to God they receive some comfort
How about you giving a speech to the people of Texas telling them instead of the wall, you're going to rebuild their homes and communities?
I'm sure they will get help from the federal government I expect though you want him to build each brick and each piece of wood by himself
Quit. Whining people

Don't forget the Play Doh supply for Donnie to hand out...
So thankful for you all!! Stay safe and thank u from an American
Thank you for all that you do!! Safe travels, while here in TX! Your Awsome!

Awesome!

FUCK TRUMP/PENCE

Does Texas have a military?
Fort Hood.. Near Killeen Tx. Largest military installation in the free world. Housed 1st Cav and 2nd AD in the 70s
It doesn't belong to Texas, it belongs to United State of America.
Do you understand the worst is yet to come?
Rivers, dams, now real problem.
Thank you to all who are helping! I dont live there but the stories I'm reading are moving. #oneAmerica

It's great weather today! Perfect for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to activate the entire #NDRF! #MARAD #Beaumont
Great weather? So if no good weather came in, trump would let them suffer til weather improved? Obama would've been on it next day.
Now this is a HUMBLY MAN...WAY TO GO PRESIDENT TRUMP!!

Thank you for your outstanding leadership.  God bless you, God bless Texas, and God Bless the USA!!!
Guess u fit the description
Thank you guys n gals
Hellsyeah.  Pray for TEXAS.   TRUMP!
Except for women, LGBTQ, POC, Veterans, disabled, elderly & low income families. We know how much you hate them.

I know. It's terrible. He wants all those people to die. He is a very bad man.
And where exactly did President Trump say anything like that??
Sweetie, actions speak louder than words. His actions, like taking food from mouths, taking away healthcare, food stamps, safety nets.
In other words cutting entitlements from welfare sponges is attempted murder??

hoo yah !!!
Thanks Mr President, your people love that

This is a bit spewing same crap over n over again
Bot
Thanks for helping.
#ImpeachTrump #UnfitForOffice #RussiaGate #TrumpColluded #TrumpTreason #TrumpTowerMoscow @DonaldJTrumpJr is a traitor like @jaredkushner
Take that
You're doing an incredible job juggling all of this. The hurricane natural disaster, the Alt-Left disaster, North Korea, and Russia.
If there was a time where the ball could be dropped to disastrous results, it would've been this month.

You didn't drop the ball, President
Thanks to the MILITARY and all donors...no TRUMP has donated a single cent!
And you know this to be a fact, how, snowflake?
"Waaaaah! Harry hurt my feelings calling trump out, so I'm gonna be a big man and call him 'snowflake'! " What a PUSSY
Like all liberals, you start projecting your animosity on others. Another example of the mental disorder known as liberalism.
Climate change will cost big league; one way or the other
Dude. This is not climate change. Idiot. This is recurring. Hurricanes are frequent
They don't believe in this phenomenon called "weather".
You don't deserve to be able to USE the word military, COWARD!
Did you call Bill, Bernie or barack that!?  What you!?
No..just YOU and trumps
