@substantivism @andreajmarkley RW scare tactics are BS! The sky is always falling, they R always coming 4your guns &refugees are taking over
@substantivism @andreajmarkley With the opportunity I will take in a small family. My fam has already discussed the issue. We aren't scared
@SenTedCruz @BennytheKite it's been going on for years in your state of Texas  and where were you? Crickets
Note to @FrankieAll 

@SenTedCruz had little power to stop the illegal immigration into Texas.

That's why he wants to be President.
@BennytheKite @SenTedCruz Cruz has no support from the people he needs to deal with even on his own side of the aisle
Note to @FrankieAll 

@SenTedCruz is doing something that #DonaldTrump isn't doing.

Beating #Hillary2016
@BennytheKite @SenTedCruz Hillary indicted gone, Davos fears Trump those are the business and power brokers sucking the blood out of America
@FrankieAll You need to clarify "Hillary indicted gone".

The FBI investigation continues.

@SenTedCruz
@BennytheKite @SenTedCruz, Hilary losing to a socialist. She will either be pushed out by her own party or indicted for email scandal
Hillary losing to a socialist. @FrankieAll 

Hillary IS a socialist.  It's documented.

@SenTedCruz the IRS thing that's a good one, people like it
@SenTedCruz teddy boy !! Just focus all your little brain cells on trying to match wits with Trump ...... Obama is managing fine without you
@SenTedCruz the refugees are still in Europe for the most part.  Although Canada (your country) has welcomed some.
@SenTedCruz @WashingtonDCTea u should stop attacking trump and serve as vp for 8 years then 8 more as potus, your young think about it
@SenTedCruz He is on a mission isn't he. Only a while longer. Sigh.
@SenTedCruz Cruz is a LIAR and if that Were true CRUZ  Should not be here

http://madworldnews.com/hillary-campaign-texas-muslims/ …
@SenTedCruz like every other President has done
@SenTedCruz I can't vote for someone where this is a question in my mind on your citizenship and eligibility for the POTUS
@SenTedCruz Your a sitting #Senator & nothing you have ever done has stopped 1 muslim #refugee from coming. They have been coming for YEARS.
@CIndyStarbuck @SenTedCruz Think you could've done more, given McConnell AND Obama working against him? #TrumpFanboy #ignorance
@RobertCFP @SenTedCruz HE!!! YES. McConnell, Obama & Boehner three of the weakest men in DC. No wonder he's going to lose to #Trump.
@CIndyStarbuck Your ignorance is astounding. Boehner isn't in the Senate. And McConnell & Obama had all the power.
@RobertCFP Your ignorance is astounding. I NEVER said Boehner was in the Senate now did I. He was a weak #RINO power broker.
@SenTedCruz u still a refugee about 15 months ago u were Canadian. I don't buy the bs that u dint know lol. U don't know ur ugly too?
@SenTedCruz @DMashak oh they are vetted! He only allows Muslims and terrorists
@SenTedCruz @DMashak And we all know you want the same thing Ted
@SenTedCruz WHY DON'T GOP'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OBAMA HAS GOT EVERYTHING HE HAS ASKED FOR. DOESN'T CONGRESS MATTER?
@SenTedCruz oh NOW you want to get rid of them before you wanted them all here...make up your mind flip flopper
@SenTedCruz @NancycBa1 You were ALL for it, but now against it? Your pollsters must have briefed you. http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/11/16/video-senator-ted-cruz-demanding-u-s-take-syrian-refugees-and-not-worry-about-terrorist-embeds/ …
@SenTedCruz @McnealyGeorge and all the democrats are helping him
@SenTedCruz you should talk, Monsieur Produit de Canada
@SenTedCruz And who let you in?
@SenTedCruz @MariahTamaya EU. 'Nuff said. I've been around. You cannot assimilate, vetted or not, people from mud hut cultures. Impossible.
@SenTedCruz And you & the other #Rinos in #Congress. #Refugees have flooded into #America for Y E A R S. And you have sat on your hands...
@SenTedCruz @RestoreHistory you mean 'unable to be' 'vetted'!
@SenTedCruz @RestoreHistory The Leftists are giving them Visa and embassy Information and Driver's Licenses! That's called 'Vetting'!
@SenTedCruz you must be afraid of everything.
@SenTedCruz we are still with you even if Palin isnt
@SenTedCruz BIG QUESTION : WHY CAN'T THIS BE STOPPED?
@SenTedCruz shut up Ted
@SenTedCruz as planned. It's all about guns, as illegals keep using the laws tighten and tighten
@SenTedCruz no
@SenTedCruz If 2yrs of vetting for refugees "insufficient", then what is sufficient?
@SenTedCruz Many of these are refuges from corrupt south American countries.
@SenTedCruz I don't appreciate your incensing rhetoric. They are sufficiently vetted and there is no flood. Tone it down, dude.
@SenTedCruz If refugees can't be vetted properly so we should keep them out, what do we do about no background checks for gun purchasers?
@SenTedCruz 
You are in congress get something going
@SenTedCruz @c5hardtop1999   Round them up send them back across the border
@sentedcruz Yeah, YOU
@SenTedCruz What should we do about the stream of German immigrants coming through the Rhine and takin our auxiliary jobs? #RomansOutOfWork
@JCabral4Congres @SenTedCruz Boehner surrendered Article I, now we have Ryan. Obama's lawless pedal to the metal fundamental transformation
@SenTedCruz untrue. There is a rigorous vetting process in place. Shame on you.
@SenTedCruz build a Canadian wall
@SenTedCruz Women and children real refugees, we should accept.We don't need Men refugees.We've seen them play Tarrarush in Europe. NOT HERE
@sentedcruz @pmgeezer The Senate of which u are a part did not pass it, raise hell show u care
@SenTedCruz None of them are more dangerous than you. Please, if you love the USA go back to Canada.
@SenTedCruz Deja vu didn't we just see O allow this very thing,when he allowed thousands of gangs&kids into the USA?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Mr. Cruz - if America had your attitude in 1957 you wouldn't be here today and your Dad would be stuck on Cuba still!
@SenTedCruz 
Now @GOP will allow 1 insufficiently vetted refugee to flood our potus election. 
Why do you support #KeystoneXL ?
#BirtherFun
@SenTedCruz as a constituent of yours, I'd like to know what you've done about it? As POTUS, what will you do? Round 'em & toss 'em out?
@SenTedCruz 
U mean they are vets? Soldiers are animal doctors

@SenTedCruz right! @realDonaldTrump will get this all straightened out and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 
@SenTedCruz The 18-24 month processing time & DOS, DHS, DOD, NCC, FBI background checks & Syria Enhanced Review aren't enough?

@SenTedCruz stop the b******* you crazy!

@SenTedCruz All I hear are criticisms, (easiest thing to do). What are your plans besides chasing your own tail, barking about @Potus?
@SenTedCruz all future  de m
Mocratic voters with a few bomb makers for good measure
@SenTedCruz 
Sargeant at Arms of Congress should arrest Obama for Treasonous Acts against America!
@SenTedCruz This can be stopped by Congress and the courts, why not stop it?
@SenTedCruz @DonliskDon 
"Insufficiently vetted"?? Get real, Senator! You mean "criminal"!
@bonnygale1 @SenTedCruz same diffrence
@M14EBRUS @SenTedCruz Obama never was on the side of tea bagging bigoted bitter clingers. And yes, he has steamrolled them.
@M14EBRUS @SenTedCruz Yes, in the eyes of tea bagging windbags who prefer war-mongering economy-destroying Republicans at the helm.
@SenTedCruz Losing Palin to Donald is really killing you. Time to pick a new target, like our great POTUS. Loser.
@SenTedCruz I am starting to think you like the feel of your pants on fire.  #Cruz2Lose
@egbee @lisafedup @SenTedCruz @tedcruz working hard fighting the corruption in DC, while #Trump was bankrolling Hillary and other liberals.
