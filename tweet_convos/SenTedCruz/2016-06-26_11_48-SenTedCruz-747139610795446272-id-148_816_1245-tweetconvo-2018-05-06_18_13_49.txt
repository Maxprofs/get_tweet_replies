Values First #NeverTrumpOrHillary No Matter What
You are so right!  Talk to Muslims who have  become Christians..we have!
@Callisto1947 They will also become more extreme under Hillary Presidency
.@SenTedCruz 
Nice to hearU! WhatR we going to do? UNITE!
#CountryFirst #MAGA #MASA
@realDonaldTrump @Reince @SpeakerRyan @newtgingrich
.@SenTedCruz UNITE
@realBenCarson @GovMikeHuckabee @seanhannity 
@munsue @arian0027 @LindaSuhler @UTHornsRawk @CarmineZozzora @Callisto1947
and you will not tire until you have turned America into a Christian version of a Taliban hell hole. 2 sides, same coin.
@c5hardtop1999 Exactly. Thanks for the straight talk.
I don't believe Islam is peaceful religion. #Shariah is contrary to much of #COTUS. Islam wants to force compliance 2 their ways
sounds like liberal Democrats. Just replace terrorists with Dems and kill with berate/blame/censure/libel/smear/lie/etc.
Shut up and endorse our nominee loser @SenTedCruz @LJones3029BC
@irishamrep1 Frightening but true
Plus a bunch of people who do!
FELLOW TEXANS! JOIN ME IN 2018 IN VOTING THIS JERK OUT OF OFFICE.  #ANYBODYBUTTEDCRUZ #ONETERMSENATOR
All religion is poison Ted. I don't want to adhere to your extreme beliefs either.
@SenTedCruz
@KayQuirk1 Sorry, Ted, but we just have to LOVE the Muslim terrorists and they'll love us back. King Barack said so!
Even Al Qaeda was astounded at Dems response to a terror attack; now must attack so not viewed as hate crime. @bakerlarry84
@realDonaldTrump  has been saying this for a year while you and your supporters have accused him of bigotry
That's what white Christian domestic terrorists think. There is by far more domestic terrorist attacks in this country
@Callisto1947 Still a big fan sir!
I'm tired of everyone calling it radical Islam @SenTedCruz It is True Core Islam if Muhammad were alive today. Radicals are the moderate 1's
sounds like radical christian terrorist and #gop members burning crosses @gop #tedcruz #LeadRight2016
Make no mistake.  This is a HOLY WAR.  It IS about a whole religion
if the party stays divided
 it will fall
thank you for your acuity on this issue sir.
I'm no Trump fan, but since he has vowed to go after ISIS and Hillary is scary, don't you think your staff should work for him?
kinda the same as the republican party! #Radicalchristianterrorists
Dear @SpeakerRyan,
This is NOT Who We Are!
Muslim Master Plan For North America (1991)
http://m.clarionproject.org/Muslim_Brotherhood_Explanatory_Memorandum …
How dare YOU insist God chose YOU. You Cuban/Canadian mental case. You help throw us into the arms of evil  @ConservativeTht
@Dab7One This is ONE time I agree with Ted. It's reason ppl want Trump for Prez. RESPECT the people's will & SUPPORT Mr. Trump!
we need you mr Cruz
why are you still here
And meanwhile...
Yes! And disarming trained and responsible citizens opens the door for extremists to massacre innocent people. This must stop!
@peddoc63 SO WHY DON'T YOU FORGIVE TRUMP ALREADY & SUPPORT HIM?  Put America FIRST & leave the ego, & hurt feelings behind.
: We need a mature person and a conservative as president like Ted Cruz.
#DUMBFUCK
or, unless we have a president who will call them radical Islamist jihadist & vow to kill them before they kill us.
You are the commander in chief America needs. I pray that the delegates do their duty in Cleveland.
@GiordanSergio which you support until you back trump
honestly terrorists are the least of your country's problems #lookinthemirror
You are right Senator Cruz.
yes radical republican extremists will not rest until every human is at war with everyone else who is different from them...
Keep fighting for the issues that matter!
that is false its who doesn't convert
I AGREE SENATOR CRUZ
You do realize the Orlando tragedy was not Radical Jihad, right? It was mental illness and homophobia, like what you spew Ted
ùb*h ju hijuh hju n
Sure
Like you are doing with our Veterans who are still dying waiting to see a doc or be admitted for treatment TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz ?
True, it's either adhere or be killed. But is standing up for the 2A rights of terrorists really a smart thing Teddy? #CruzShit!
There is nothing peaceful about Islam, or about their murdering, psychotic, rapist prophet who will never be compared w/Jesus.
Islam is a cockroach that needs to choke on a splinter. 20% of all Muslims understand the Koran. 80% listen to radical Iman's.
modern day inquisition. Nothing new. Religion must be abolished
very true senator Cruz. I just wish this administration and the 2 mainstream candidates realized this sad fact
@peddoc63 True, but "conservatives" essentially R supporting HRC?? A House Divided Can not Stand. The treat is HRC not Trump!!
Unfortunately,  too many US citizens are indoctrinated to believe otherwise.  Can't escape reality.  What a propaganda machine.
@peddoc63 Ted, back off the bullshit..you have done more to help bring it here than stop it..TPP and refugees need to go..
but in America you still chose to not pass gun reform to stop them from getting guns in America. I'm glad you will never be Prez
I love freedom and I love you TED CRUZ
can we say same for Christians? Or are they always right?
Seems to me that the Dems don't really care.
and so will christians that hate homosexuals
U really that stupid??
radical Islamic terrorists will never come close to exterminating everyone who doesn't adhere to their beliefs, you fear monger.
this point cannot be overstated. Ask the Copt.
And what is that their extremist believe since they kill Muslims,their children,their wives, homes and towns? Jews n US doing it
you need to chill out
Be a man and endorse Trump
Why do we call it "Radical"? It's the way of their Prophet & in their Holy books. We're leaving a Loophole for a Trojan horse
You mean just like Christianity during the Crusades and Inquisition? Was it wars that stopped that?
why extreme?....they're just reading the Koran and its demands
ok, you said that before. But tell us Why they hate us? Who is they? How do you fight an ideology?
you need to unite with Trump and beat the dumocrats and crooked killary and her goons.
Aren't you aware the MSM would have us believe it's conservative Christian Constitutional gun owners who are the problem?
why can't Senate with majority do anything to stop insanity? House majority doing nothing either? Stop funding program.
You should have ended it with "vote Trump"
Isn't that going to take a long time?
How about you quit protecting their ability to get weapons in the US?
you speak the truth Mr Cruz
I'm glad we elected you to Washington for that completely obvious assessment.
>>Like kill the gays eh Ted.. yur guys adhere to that too..
maybe we could try not bombing their children?
<------believes ISIS is setting up a caliphate because we "bomb their children". I guess the refugees all bombed them too.
Jump on board with Trump and let's solidify the party. Don't allow the Clinton machine to continue. Keep America first!!!
Wow! They sure have their work cut out for them.  
Close the borders, and quit making crap deals that do not benifit Americans. Put us first!!!
You should be Trump's VP.
we people really need u to get behind DT together to beat Dem for our country please!
supporting #ISIS and @NRA extremists by making @ColtFirearms easily available?! @nprpolitics 
MustWatch: https://youtu.be/RolEI5n4Jxs 
Now you are right on the money. What is wrong with the Liberals and democrats that they cant get it?
Whereas Christians will just bore everyone to death.
call it what it is: JIHAD
Yes, if you'd have said that louder along with DEPORTING ALL illegal aliens, ending HARMFUL Free Trade..YOU WOULD BE NOMINATED!
please endorse DT the people's nominee or #NeverRubioCruzRyan
why post more fear mongering
So that must mean you'll honor your pledge and support @realDonaldTrump correct?
Shut up you are done.  You lost to Trump for god sakes.
And America can't rest until you are out of any elected position
Teddie, more fear mongering. They'll never kill everyone who doesn't believe as they do. Do you cower under your bed at night?
@dixieland4life Ted is right
I could not agree with you more. We need to know who we are fighting.
Sadly Ted this doesn't matter to the lawless president and liar in the bad pants suits.
guess that's gonna happen in your world certainly not in ours
Absolutely right!
Just like you.
Well said Ted. From the #Brexit winners of Britain. Get behind Trump Ted. All us Brit's want him to beat #CrookedHillary
when are you going to endorse your party's candidate for #Potus? @realDonaldTrump realDonaldTrump
It's not EXTREME. It's SATANIC!!
Islam = Submission.  Chices are Convert
Pay high Taxes
Die

Ergo, now z th time 4 all good ppl 2 come 2 aid of party. #GOP #RNC #Stnd as 1 w/ ppls choice. @SpeakerRyan Rt 2 protect family
Just like white supremacist evangelicals.
like your buddy trump he doesn't like anybody if is NOT white people
you're the dude with awesome plan to 'carpet bomb until the sand glows'. How many innocents would that action destroy?
Trump has been saying this since day 1.
and his losing to Hillary we needed Ted Cruz
hahahaha
100% Donald Trump is a big liberal actor who is losing and will lose to he's best friend Hillary Clinton
if you say so. Good luck with that.
agreed! They want to destroy the world. They have absolute faith that only they are right.
call it what it really is SHIRIA BELIEF AND KORAN IN DEPTH!
what's going on in DC?
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
then you better get behind Trump
Is that how Trump likes it?
