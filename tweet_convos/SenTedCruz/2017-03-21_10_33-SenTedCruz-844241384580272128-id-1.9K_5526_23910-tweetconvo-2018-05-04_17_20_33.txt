You'd think you would want your kid to have best start in life.

Thank you Sir // So we can make progress in time to be // Thank you all //
I love NASA and I really do hope we can start funding NASA better to proceed with their exploration.
Oh, yay, there are 2 women squeezed into this photo. Thank you for noticing that WOMEN MATTER!!  What a bunch of dickheads.
Rice University about this very same topic---a pursuit of discovery. Here are some of his words, "...... Well, space is there,

The worst part( besides being a pathological liar) is he is not qualified to be President.
Pathological liar?? Oh are we talking about Hillary?
- No we are talking about Donald Trump who not only lies, but cheats everyone
And don't look at the future destruction of human civilization by global warming!
.@POTUS you promised to revamp our infrastructure. That exists nowhere in your job-killing budget. The American people see your lies.
job killing but he's created jobs already?  where are your facts?  FAKE NEWS.
what jobs? The ones he claimed he saved are already gone. Check it out.
This week large coal CEO announced he CANNOT bring back mining jobs. Google for his announcement

Decide yourself
Qué no entiendes que nadie te quiere mmgvo
I'm came from America. Please help me! Please please
probably is all that's left after the Obama years who defunded NASA and gave that money to Pakistan and Iran.  Idiot
Just curious when all you pretentious #FakeNews media bums will quit throwing your bottles and start supporting our @POTUS #MAGA 
Never? We don't support TREASON btw
Sure, we will need a new planet to immigrate to since you climate deniers are determined to destroy the one we have.
Is the Asteroid Redirect project funded? (The one that could save the planet from an impact)

Didn't your budget cut proposals include NASA?
Trump believes in flat earth ..
Today iwill see what's going to the world's ok tks messanger Me ok tks

GENELAB,COM When we registered http://Genelab.com  in 1998, there was no NASA International Space Project, https://genelab.nasa.gov  
Mr.Trumps administration is holding EAD clearances of foreign students who have paid money and taken degree from US University
joke cut the budget and climate change research lying pig

Ryan Owens deserves justice. His father deserves solace. Republicans spent 4 years on Benghazi. #Yemen deserves proper investigation.

@realDonaldTrump We are praying for you @realDonaldTrump #PrayForTrump #GodBlessAmerica

you don't believe in science- NASA can you send him to the moon???
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!
I AND WE ALL PEOPLES DO RESPECT AND SALUTE WITH HONEST HEART FOR THE WHITE HOUSE WITH PRESENT PRESIDENT U.S.A.
it was ok For Hillary Clinton to sell Uranium to Russia. But that was ok then. As long as she got rich. PUTIN wasnt bad then?
SHOW THE STOOPS THAT THE EARTH AS WELL AS OTHER PLANETS ARE NOT FLAT LOL. #NASA
Destroying public education and further limiting access to higher education so no one will be qualified for a NASA job.
Unfortunately when they discover something you will say it's FAKE
This desire should not involve a political party affiliation, but just an American pioneer spirit.
The 1st and last time Truck Dump Trump will do ANY GOOD while he's in office! HELP US GODS/UNIVERSE/ALIENS or @StephenAtHome give us a joke?
Yeah, right! You support them so much that you propose to cut NASA budget "bigly."  Hypocrite!
is this the bill that cuts all the funding to NASA's climate change research?
. Space
..The final frontier ..

It's about darn time...#MAGA
He didn't even spell anything wrong! He probably hired a proofreader.
.@POTUS You know if @NASA gives you a space suit, you're legally required to use it, right? Congrats, you're the new president of the moon!
@RachelMickaela @POTUS @NASA The moon doesn't want him either.
Thanks for your false narrative, comrade. Now, move on.
none wanted him just hated politics as usual, try something crazy
Great Job Mr. President. We really need to know more about our universe. You got my vote sir.
Thank God and the American people for President Trump.  Great work.  Our public space program has gone astray too long.
Thank  you. I believe both our "public" and secret space programs (Disclosure) are the most vital/important pursuits.
Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP
for the next rally fund us at 
http://Usapray4trump.com   @March4Trump RT&Share
By cutting funding to science & denying NASA findings on climate change!
isn't it funny how NASA has conflicting views with itself and then there is NOAA conflicting data on the climate.
Both agencies are consist in their conclusions that climate change is man-made
What's  man made about climate change is....THE LIE.

Bhahahahah you win twitter today
Which is pretty much most of twitter. FYI. @KINGTRUMP45 @JoeMyGod Just like the popular vote.
Someone who voted for a reality TV show host for President *would* think likes/RTs matter in some way 
and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And,
you finally did something I like.   A lot.
1. Every "attempt" you make at looking Presidential comes in holding up an order/bill you signed like show & tell...
2 Sad. You have so many alternate realities. In any, do you realize the trouble you are in? Or the danger you have put US in?
go nasa! Let's see what's out there. 
@reaDonaldTrump: WAY TO GO PRESIDENT TRUMP! THANK YOU FOR RE-INSTATING THE SPACE PROGRAM MAYBE CREATING 200-400 COMPUTER JOBS!!
will you take their healthcare away too?
Sweet!

Now, was the rest of the nation's science budget earmarked in somehow?? If not, I'll do my damnedest to see that it is.
Are you launching him into space with a one way ticket?
@iPOscreatejobs @NASA Maxine batshitcrazy corrupt waters says you'll be impeached soon... time to unleash the constitution on dems
.@POTUS @NASA hopefully they can find us a way to inhabit space when you kill our planet
The one thing I can support
You didn't write this, punctuation and no scare quotes give you away. #trumprussia
You've been had Mr President. NASA is a joke and a waste of taxpayers money. I thought you knew better.
Please double NASA's budget. Discoveries of new technologies are accelerated by exploration.
ANOTHER WINNER! IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT DAY!
but your proposing massive cuts...
for once, the president does something right. I'm shocked.
Just a matter of time until you and your corrupt admin is forced out of office like Nixon.
The feck you do. You're limiting research on Earth, you know, the closest planet we have, the one where we need data...
by the way ask @NASA to do whatever they can to bring you back to Mars . You can't be Human.
Thank you for your support sir.
What a uniquely Trumpian dishonest way to misrepresent budget cuts and your assault on science and planet Earth! #UnPresidented
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!
Well We don't Trust NASA and all Their lies...WTF
Thanks.  After Obama destroyed Nasa we are lucky to have you.
POTUS I believe that this account needs to have a password change. All the haters post stay on top and ours stay underneath
-President Trump excellent bill signing. Advice start with building a Moon Outpost where we can launch from. Mike Gates
@DonaldJTrumpJr @NASA  AND  NASA's pictures from space clearly illustrate climate change and its ongoing and devastating effects
Thanks for doing something right finally
@DonaldJTrumpJr @NASA Nice one, Sir.
surprised not to see any Russian Astronauts there, or were there. Don't know anymore with the Russian spy in the WH
e.Emanuel is a fortune teller. quit spreading lies
he's a hypocrite!
Regan won cold war, rebuilt economy and increased space exploration, dems still don't see it. No hope for them
maybe they can drop you off on another planet and leave you there.
yet you want to cut budgets and research 
for more info, check out the movie Lost in Space :)
Perfect, one way trip for Trump &  in his family.
Let's Claim It For Ourselves!!! Terraform It, And Make Mars Great Again!!!  #Mars #NASA #MAGA #MMGA
I couldn't have said it better myself! #Mars #MMGA
You want to get us to Mars but are not concerned at all with taking care of the earth and it's environment.Sad!
Trump Budget eliminates all NASA earth science and satellites.  Gag Order on climate science.
Reaffirming @NASA only to cripple it with budget cuts later. #hypocrisy
@realDonaldTrump Lets get the ball rolling in advanced #military defense in #space. #SpaceWarfare #CyberWarfare #MAGA
@newtgingrich 
Sucssesful !
since when do you believe in science?
psycho! you just slashed their budget! did you think we'd all forget??? #nofascistusa #ImpeachTrump
thank you for supporting NASA Mr. President. Our  future appreciates it. Don't listen to the haters and naysayers. Thumbs up!
Keep Going Mr. Trump the true Americans (poor and middle-classes) believe in you! The rest we should ship out of the US
Climate change is a liberal scare tactic designed for people that can't thing for themselves. Must also be some NASA employees
are you jujo????
...as long as their discoveries don't support evidence if human effect on climate change. Even if it risks our planet's future.
cool!  Mr. President, are you cutting their budget at all?  Just wondering.
traitor lock him up
You may be intelligent, but you've just confirmed to me that you're also corrupt. Sadly, I am not surprised. #JustAnotherPolitician
WE NEED NASA BUT MAXINE WATERS WE CALLED FOR HER RESIGNATION WE THE PEOPLE NO MORE MESSING AROUND WITH ANTICHRIST LOVE
The next time that asshole Trudeau  comes down there lock the asshole  up His budget 0f 8 billion pushed back to2035 disgrace
first safety then NASA.  From Z
Manifest Destiny 2.0 time
about time you did something useful to the planet
What we need is a fatal hairspray accident in the oval office.
hard work
That's the least of our f...ing worries
if you support NASA's discoveries, why don't you support studying climate change-something 97% of scientists agree is happening?
this makes sense but protecting the environment we currently occupy does not? #bullshit
would u have your bot only post to a single account -- I barely want to hear this drivel from you once
oh support them, but ignore the scientists & engineers that work every day to protect this planet...
Go trump! Go NASA!!
@NASA_Orion @NASA Thank you Mr. President! Making America Smart Again. And allowing NASA to go farther than ever.
Trump, if you are with science stop the "vaccine-autism" hoax. My autism and all other autistic people are not vaccine's fault.
Glad you want to support them. Your environmental regulation rollbacks would suggest you don't believe in science at all though
As an authorization of funding, this bill doesn’t actually allow $  2B spent That will require an appropriations bill at a later date
@Gurusaday1 @NASA why spend money on the outer world when the country is dealing so many issues.Please pass #HR392 and fix #GCBACKLOG
@NASA_Johnson @NASA so, you got bored with being king of earth. Now must be king of Mars tremendous! Barack never born on Mars SAD!
So... you're supporting research so we can escape earth after your science-denying buddies destroy our planet?
RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURN. Under audit is ridiculous.
thank you, discover new worlds.
Grip of a Tiger 
Esto si que es un fenomeno
Thank you for getting back to the missiôn. I was completely mystified that O made Muslim outreach a NASA mission.
you signed it because of the NASA ties to Russia.

yet you deny climate change?  Makes no sense.
Let's hope progress is allowed to be made before the next shift in policy.
Determined to spend more money the country doesn't have, aren't you? Yet you kill programs that help feed and house the needy.
@Space_Station @NASA Some good news for a change!
.@POTUS @SenTedCruz @NASA Yes! 
it seems to me private enterprise is doing a good job without costing the taxpayers
Traitor-In-Chief who doesn't beleive in science. lol Just another photo op for you
What a wonderful news !!
I cannot believe the tweets from these uneducated people!!
Are they even citizens of the USA ???
Go Trump!!!
Yes, I am a citizen, a concerned one with a child in school and a 65 year old mom. They need to come first!!
I'm glad they're gonna look for new planets behavior w/ your new legislation we won't have this one for much longer
Except when it comes to climate science right?
veo muy buena la gestion de trump economicamente pero las relaciones con la prensa debe de manejarse mejor
The Hateful Media is so mad they are spitting blood and hate. Go Trump Go
BS. You don't know what science is.
No funding for NASA but - hey! - you got a cool jacket.
be strong
DT looks like a 5 yr old on christmas morning.
I see it, but because trump is attached I can't help feeling like somewhere important there is a lie
what about NASA support of climate change science?
How about a big apology to President Obama?!? No distraction can rescue you.
You probably lie about what color you like the most. Insecure much?
yeah!!!  Go find a new Earth bc with the proposed EPA cuts yer just gonna Shit down the Neck of this planet!!
hello!
Great news!
This is great
interesting reference to 'science'... You don't believe in science!
We have people that are homeless, losing healthcare, +  need food! You cut PBS and other social programs, BUT SHOOTING MONEY INTO SPACE!
okay I believe in space exploration, but why would he fund a Mars Mission OVER healthcare or other programs?
this was already in place, do you not have a lick of honesty.
And cut the budget for NASA by 30%!  They will send people to Mars by hitching a ride on a Russian rocket, I have friends there
is #NatGeo writing about this
Please free @NASA from its shackles to make Muslims feel good about themselves. We're ready to feel good about America again.
more great news from a great leader. Go POTUS
Military spending and space exploration are the only things that produces any results from budget that can be seen
