Why don't these terror groups attack to Israel?
Islam is already attacking Israel.
dude I think you have it flip flopped,
Just look at history. Israel is Hebrew land & Islam is a scourge.
land is land, religion is man made, don't try to justify stealing land for 'religion'
nope. History says otherwise. I'm not using religion to justify it. I'm saying Muslims hate Jews and want to wipe them out.
Actually, Islam/Muslims hate ALL others. @CavsFanFromNJ
you could say the same about Judaism because they believe "God" gave them land and don't want anyone else in it
obviously @UN run by dumb & dumber.
Actually, run by dumbest.  @netanyahu @UN
um
.@netanyahu You stopped paying attention to the UN in 1968. Why worry now?
and you need to burn your Israeli passport as you promised long time again
yeah but like the rest of them she's full of false promises, sadly!
no UNESCO
Saudi Money. Its official now.
Ummm, Batman and Robin are fictional, like the bible.

Unhinged madman. U know u have no rights to Paletsine and make a mockery of your land grab by continuing ur theater of absurd
In a moral world he would be in a padded cell in a str8 jacket or hung from rafters after a trial at the Hague
UNHINGED IDEA OF BRINGING WORLD’S JEWS 2 SETTLE ON OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN LAND IS REAL ‘THEATRE OF THE ABSURD’
For a man with such a serious role to play in so many lives, I'm impressed that you still have a sense of humor left - it pleases me.
You should invite anyone from @UNESCO to visit Jerusalem and start digging - the archaeology cannot be denied. It's JEWISH!
they will come up with every imaginable excuse to deny. It's based on hate. It's a spiritual war
That it is my friend.
Laurel & Hardy no doubt
Shame on the UN for constant Israel bashing!
 well, for starters stop bashing the Palestinians with nazi checkpoints, and remove the  sage on Ghaza.

@zlando Get Israel out of jewhating UN now or we get seen as legitimising its jewhate

Mr Netanyahu sir you are one of Gods Finest and i pray someday icanmeet you and shake your hand dear kind sir. God bless yu
ma fondamentalmente #sticazzi
The Bible ITSELF denies your claims to the Holy Land. 
... Don't worry, Yahushua HaMashiach will restore us. He's coming back!
@stringfellowfr4 Sir, agree w/ you. UNESCO is not organized to make religious decisions. Therfore member decisions are irrelevant
. Any human who has read their bible as i have 1000s of times must conclude the God who wrote it created all things & rules all
... its better with using the thought -> its like denying peanut butter gets put on bread to make a peanut butter bread sandwich.
... if someone is allergic to peanuts, they'd just eat a jelly sandwich; anyway, @UNESCO was insane to not connect jews w/ judah.
-> to not connect judaism to the temple mount in jerusalem, the capital city of the kingdom of judah, majorly discredits @UNESCO.
... u all need to use both names; the area's a layered thought -> the temple mount's still there.
-> this is the disrespect committed that u all seem to not get; the temple mount's still in jerusalem today and to omit it is wrong.
... the temple mount isn't a past tense thought ... you are today asking history to write it down as though it is ... this is wrong.
-> you'll never build peace this way; peace is a present day mindset & you're omitting a major thought of it for millions of people.
@netanyahu ... this I can fully agree with you on is a disconnection resulting from a punch in the gut..!
otra cosa israel no deve pone un Apartheid a palestina bueno veremo que pasa ok
muralla china no tuviera relacion com china el teleferico de jerico es de israel pero esta en palestina veremo que pasa

@AndresDayLewis
well there u have it now step aside
F**k @UNESCO - the @UN has always been a den of anti-Jewish sentiment.
I hope you realize that devout #Christians will be your only remaining friend soon.
Thank you! There is a connection; God Himself set Jerusalem up, & He put His name on her. Jerusalem belongs to Israel!
@GoateePFE well... they don't comprehend basic arithmetic, yet here they are, getting paid to do calculus. incoming...birds above
@slava381977 Jerusalem and everything in it belongs to the Jews. #Trump #NeverHillary
Adam and Eve ?
They are laughing stock. Yes, you heard that right @UNESCO You are a joke.
An international body like that should not be taken serious. It is as ridiculous as can be.
They have nothing else to do that?
@SenTedCruz HRC Obama gaves billions to Iran . !!!!
@israel didnt exist before 1947 so it has NO CONNECTION. #jews do big difference.. not how your president #spun it
Next one? UNESCO will discover that there is NO connection between you and democracy, you and legality and you and Human Rights.
@JoelCRosenberg genius! I and my family are praying for Israel
G-D BLESS YOU
We Israel and pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Under Trump, Jerusalem will be the capitol!
go through the list my country @NGRPresident Nigeria voted against the wishes of the Jews and the Christians!!!!!I WILL SPEAK UP
@MBuhari the @NGRPresident not have have abstained like some countries that are secular e.g Ghana,is a slap on all nig christians
my country is secular,with equal number of Christians and Muslims yet @MBuhari the @NGRPresident voted in support.I WILL SPEAK UP
I admire your leadership, sir.
Israel and her God are a majority!
"Not by power nor by might but by My spirit...says the Lord God of Israel!" #Torah #BibleProphecy #EndTimes 
You may be the only political leader in the world with the rare combination of courage and integrity.
how about archeology, scripts and centuries of presence? Enough for you?
don't think I have personal final say. But im pro two states. Why not? Arabs live there as well.
you have an amazing desire to tell people what hey think based off ten seconds on Twitter. Like to stereotype?
I pray fervently for God's immediate deliverance of Israel and the salvation of all Arabs! :-)
Apartheid Zionists denying Palestinians their homes & lands are doing exactly that.Mr Natanyahu you are not human being.
The Arab Gutter, sent my dog Mohammed, a check for 1000000 bucks. The Clinton SEX SLAVE Bank will honor it. BIRTHDAYS
Dear Isreal, please know there are folks praying for you daily! peace and love.
On the contrary, maybe officially confirm the connection between Israel and 9/11.

Gefilte and Fish
#Zionism & #hatred,
I consider myself neutral on the Israel-Palestine conflict but this is absolutely ridiculous. Shame on Unesco
f u .
@klyn625 Next UNESCO decision: the Vatican is not connected to Catholicism.
We must change the koranl like @UNESCO changes the bible. If they have the right, we have the right to do so too.
You are quite serious.
The Universal Mind is the rsn why we're hre and why we hve to be hre. Mslms don't hsitte to mntn their religs accssrs. why we do?
do you know how to read?
The ONLY sane person in the middle east! Bibi, you ROCK!
They are a bunch of frauds.  Israel.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz UNESCO denying bagels don't go with cream cheese. Blasphemy! Sacrilege! Damnation!
grow up, you're the leader of a country that has nukes.

#IStandWithIsrael @slava381977

We are with you our Jewish brothers & sisters, though not Jewish, God be with you, blessings from Australia
the UN has less credibility than the ABC
or the beatles and music...
and the current Islamic temple mount was built on what was the Roman's HQ? Just curious on your thoughts if it was a possibility?
Mr. President, what is your view on Bob Cornuke's finding that the Temple is actually further south in the city of David?
you are Anti Christ, and it will be Haram Al sharif
#whats next...freeing the wall from religious extremists so all of us are able to pray there..good next step!
it is outrageous!  I'd even say it sounds like a deliberate provocation, sad, crazy times :-(
zionism and goyim?
savage!!
piece of shit
Ruego a usted y a cada Israelí PERDON por el voto de mi país, no expresa mi sentir. Mi anhelo es la recuperación de su herencia.
American citizens stand with you @Netanyahu and Israel. God bless you.
Islam and human rights?. Oh, wait...
U have't any right  there .go to where u were coming. So worst enemy  .
One day, we Americans will help you solve the problem once we're underway restoring governance "of the people, by the people"...
Israelies have stooped so low and showed the world how these cowards don't even spare innocent children of Palestine
die
they didnt deny the connection,dumdum, they just choose to use the arabic, then the "hebrew" in quotes.  Thats acknowledgement!
This is the reality and its the truth people like you never accept it, 
Stop killing innocent people
I respect you and Isreal!!  My apologies for obama!

“All of Israel is a occupation”

It is ONLY a coincidence?
it's like Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen
What position is President Obama taking on this outrage? That will tell us a lot. What about our supposed allies? Ugh.
100% d'accord avec vous monsieur le Premier Ministre  L'Unesco est une organisation antisémite !!
AMERICA LOVES YOU SIR..WE LOVE ISRAEL..AND GOD LOVES BOTH OF US. GOD BLESS YOU.

ramesh suresh
Don't worry Mr. netanyahu God said he will bless them that blesses you and curse them that curses you so all is well.
"No Jews" Your recent video nailed this. Pure anti semitism as national policy on culture. Keep fighting.
don't worry Bibi.. The next US President will recognise Israel's capital, Jerusalem #UNESCO #standwithIsrael #MAGA
batman and Robin: Fictional characters in a made up book.
Exactly.
“@netanyahu: What's next? A UNESCO decision denying the connection between peanut butter and jelly? Batman and Robin? Rock and roll?”

@AlizaBinNoun excellent mais lundi ou mardi vote définitif nous comptons sur vous pour faire basculer cette ignominie
@vuIInet a che si riferisce ?
sintetizzando, secondo l'Unesco il Monte del tempio a Gerusalemme non ha a che fare con l'ebraismo
capito.beh comprensibile la reazione,ha a che fare con diverse religioni tra le quali quella ebraica e negarlo è stupido
l'Unesco è una pagliacciata
basta pensare che mesi fa ai voti al Kosovo venne negata la partecipazione unesco da stati che nemmeno esistono, la Palestina.
Except they're _dangerous clowns_!

My post didn't go directly to Facebook like it normally does. .  Gave the Internet to the UN now this..no free speech! GONE!!!!!!
interesting to see how dismissive you are of the Jewish connection to the western wall.
Really, they can deny the connection between man & woman? Who is @UNESCO against #HaShem? Nothing less than nothing. #SomosIsrael
these are stupid people paid for by the people. Kartziot
My man ! Be strong. The land belongs to Jacobs offspring . Always will and God will fight for the Jews
Pour ceux que ça intéresse j'ai fait une série de 4 vidéos expliquant ce vote judeophobe à l'#UNESCO https://youtu.be/_GVwavW15bA

It's clear:Arabas call themselves Palestinians invented history with the help of Jewish & Anti-Semitic Lefties hate Jews & Israel
@debsellsslc The fear of Islamic Terrorism rears its ugly head again! #TheJewishState
, I think the french weretrying to please the arabs that's why they voted against Israel and any jewish connection to the temple

That's about how useful they are. Unnecessary is a Rogue Organism.
Someone has a witty new intern,eh?
You & Racism ?
How funny is to see the gentiles repeating the same mistake over and over again... When they finale will get it?
.@netanyahu These are all American initiatives Bibi. Doesn't Israel have anything legitimate worth providing as examples? #land and #theft
@tedcruz So, he compared his country to a peanut butter sandwich. I swear the world is run by 8y olds that can't play nice.
