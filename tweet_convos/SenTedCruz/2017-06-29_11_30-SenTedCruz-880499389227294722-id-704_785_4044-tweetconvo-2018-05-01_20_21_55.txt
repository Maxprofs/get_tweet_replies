This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan â€¦
@POTUS @peplamb @FLOTUS 

Mike Pence is the boot-licking lackey of a pussy-grabbing narcissist.
Mr. V.P; We don't care about "Replace".  Just get the thing "REPEALED".  Please! Open boarders across state lines & go from there.
What You Guys are Doing In the White House Monday Trhu Friday . are You putting together A New Tax bill, A Fair And balance Health Care bill
#NoAugustRecess until the job is done. Best get it right this time .If U don't the dems and #FakeNews will blame our @Potus Not an option
Never mind repeal and replace ACA. Impeach and replace @POTUS. Do your job as he is, clearly, incapable of doing his. #ImpeachTrumpNOW
I have an idea. repeal the laws for welfare too or set it to where people are able to get medicaid and food stamps that doesn't require

@JohnCornyn @SenateGOP why don't you support @SenTedCruz amendment  what are you afraid of, #freedom #unalienablerights
I'm for repeal of Obamacare.  It might be easier to get cooperation if Obamacare is off the table.
Repeal it.  Do it in stages so as not to harm anyone.  Put Medicaid back on the states. Its their problem for keeping ghettos in their state
I think you get please help our president to do the same. Thanks
taking a dead end job in order to be able to eat. Between rent and vehicles and other bills people don't have the money for food. fix it
Heroes all of you. #Sarcasm
Pro-life means pro-healthcare!  This bill will endanger the health of thousands of mothers, babies, and children!
This is a great opportunity to bleed a little more from the poor and sick to benefit billionaires. Why not fix it for all?

This is NOT the America I grew up in.  Please excuse us while we deal with the Idiot who has taken over our Govt. It won't last long
Healthcare should be good enough for ALL (includes politicians, senators, representatives, ) #concernedconstituent #CollinsMurkowskiHeller
You mean work on #DeathCare
Continue 2 find away 2 kill less is ur actual translation here 17% only approves this hateful black act-
God Bless our VP and POTUS #RepealObamacare NOW 
Amen...
How about working with the Senators who are not puppets of @POTUS and who care about the millions to lose insurance? Do you care?
Praying for His guidance as you all are working for the good of we the people. Wanda Winburn Southland CH.
When will this be solved, it is so important, we need lower costs and good healthcare, come on help us!!
Amazing sir!
ALL TRUMPS GOTTA DO IS SIGN AN EO THAT REPEALS THE CONGRESS EXEMPTION & FORCES THEM ON THE SAME GARBAGE....THEY'LL REPEAL ASAP
Just repeal, no replace.
Not going to happen lol
Quit trying to kill US citizens by killing their health care.  You and your cronies r monsters!
Stop hurting the American people!! Go put a punching bag in your garage if you need to hurt something.
JUST REPEAL IT!!!!!
Cancel recess after July 4 so Obamacare repeal gets done
What are we not being told? #NOBRCA #NOAHCA #NOACA GOP ran on/ $ off of/was elected for #FULLRepeal & your constitutional oaths sealed it
Hey VP,can you tell Sen Collins to switch parties please? She is a Democrat pure & simple. Never will she vote people over gov.
The axis of evil
Tax-payer funds should not cover illegals healthcare. Privatize healthcare. Look at Kansas doctors plan
You don't know hard work. You are one evil sound byte.
More like working on Cripple & Kill Americans bill
#FullRepeal then private sector - no govt involvement. Look at VA w/govt involved
Repeal & Discard. No replacement! Government + Insurance is the problem with health services. Let the market work without interference.
Just repeal the stupid obamashit fiasco
Sen. Cruz, Lee, Paul, & others, HOLD THE LINE ON FULL REPEAL.Congress MUST totally undo that Marxist piece of excrement & put back free mkt
Sen. Cruz, IF U DO NOT REPEAL OBAMACARE NOW IT WILL NEVER GET DONE. THIS is the best opportunity 2 get what we used have--better healthcare
NO VP Pence, the promise WAS REPEAL!  THEN morphed 2 replace/ repair. WE WANT FULL REPEAL, NOTHING LESS WILL DO.
I wish they would repeal and replace you and your @POTUS
You need to find something else to work on like the total Administration - stop trying to take healthcare away from Americans - you have it
@realDonaldTrump @SenToomey @SenCapito @FoxNews @AP @TIME don't u mean find a way to still give a tax cut to a few at the expense of many?
It's a shame you're wasting time only talking to one side. Health insurance isn't red or blue, right or left, Obamacare or Trumpcare.
The WORST proposed bill EVER designed. Horrifying results.  Shame on the GOP for this cruel, deadly bill.
Mikey the dunce
REPEAL!!! Do NOT replace!  Get government OUT of our healthcare insurance! It is NOT their job to meddle in private insurance - PERIOD!!
Instead of trying to fix health insurance, why don't they investigate/fix of control cost of healthcare?! That's where the problem is!
You should be impeached for the lyin' Clinton you are!
Your failures are a joke; your polices are  bent on destroying American lives. Resign for the sake of our Country.
How did the value-added-tax find its way into the new healthcare bill? Where's tax reform? What happened to repeal and replace?
For the sake of what? Simply repealing and replacing. This plan is garbage! Drain the swamp? Not even close!
Bless @tedcruz @SenMikeLee BUT that doesn't include YOU 'LYIN Teapartier who vowed tor repeal #obamacare til Trump!
You have an ever increasing role in this gov. None can truly appreciate your sacrifices. selah. Thank you.
U also sold any dignity and even yr soul to D.T. after he embarrassed yr wife and entire family w vicious lies and u. #trumpYesMan
Forget replace! Just repeal the damned thing!
You mean repeal & devastate...or repeal and destroy... or repeal and kill or...repeal and who gives a damn what happens win just want a win!
God bless you Vice President Pence!
Tired of hearing how hard they are working.  Let's get it done, now!  We all work hard.
@VP   why are sheep producers not allowed to purchase live sheep in Mexico and bring them back here? The USA closed the border in 2000.
how much is this each time costing the american taxpayers?  there must be a regulation how many times a bill can be introduced to vote!
Separate bills REPEAL, then RESTORE! Call it what ever, back to free market, cross state lines, whatever! Repeal first!
Just repeal every last word! Then REALLY restore the greatest healthcare in the world!
Get it done quickly please
Can hardly wait. You and every single republican who murders Americans with this horrible tax break for the wealthy, will be voted out.
If it's such a great deal... than why are more and more Republican's lining up against it? Perhaps YOU should read the laws content!
If you know that if you do something it MIGHT harm another human being would you still do it? Then why is Pence trying to harm AMERICANS?
I hope the Senators know how upset the people are about their childish non caring behavior and not listening to us and the need for help
@tedcruz listen man, if there was ever a time for the zodiac killer to mysteriously reappear, it's this moment. You know what you have to do
What is being done about the Antifa protesters? I am also wondering if you have seen they are removing a Cross from a Church. Ada, Ok
Replace the ACA with Medicare for all.
Ted Cruz front and center. Yes!
GET IT DONE. It better be good
Work harder...  This is really not that difficult...
Pigs
NO!
Go to your soul. It knows the President is aligned with the dark side. Bring your light into the WH. WWJD.
If you really are a Christian, your heart must be hurting, your soul must be trying to bring back of light of Christ. Trump is darkness.
Fools following idiots
Just wondering about why tweets may/may not be archived, and who makes this decision? @vp
The government should stay out of the healthcare business.  Instead it should break the monopoly of the AMA over treatment options.
At least you're trying to do some work instead of tweeting none sense attacts on women. For me a man that trash a woman isn't a man at all.
Full repeal. Full repeal. Full repeal.
#FULLREPEAL
Working real well, isn't it.
Just make it so it's not required. Health Insurance should be a choice not government demanded.
Trump insulted your wife. You were so enraged. Where is that now? We are drowning here in Texas in the madness of trump corruption. Act!
This entire administration is an embarrassment to the universe!
Thank you & God bless you Vice President Pence. Praying that the GOP can find a solution to the Obamacare nightmare.
Imagine the chaos, if Trump lost and it was not being replaced, good work
I like how Cruz has started supporting and defending @POTUS I wish the rest of the GOO would do the same
Stop it, look at the polls Americans don't want this. We want to fix Obamacare.
Senator Cruz, thank you for working on the repeal of the unaffordable "i don't care" act.
Does it feel great to strip 22 million of health ins and rip away Medicaid from those that need it the most to line your pockets!  Shameful
Stop gov involvement in our h/c, free market is the answer, it is not this difficult, please do the right thing.
STOP HIM FROM DESTRUCTIVE TWEETING...dammit, what the hell is wrong with him?  He's the President for God's sake.  GROW UP TRUMP
With a giant tax cut for your wealthy donors?
#FullRepeal #DoNotReplace #GetGovtOutOfHealthcare
@POTUS @VP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
Get rid of it all. Don't leave anything that in the future could lead to socialized medicine.
Control Trump. Please
Wasted time w @realDonald Trump sending immoral tweets. You've now lost a follower. Enough is enough.
Replace it with complete BS
Universal healthcare seems inevitable..high cost of Med-Tech n Legal n compliance..it's like pissing up a rope or getting blood from stone!
Less expensive and more choices to pay out of pocket rather than pay insurance premiums and deductibles..  too simple, so overlooked.
Go single payer!!
Keep trump away from female reporters who resemble Ivanka 
So it's not about making it greater, but attempting to destroy anything about Pres. Obama. Hmm personal. We shall see what God 'LL do.
You are one sick puppy. #GOP health care plans would be a death sentence to thousand of Americans. You are sick and demented!
@SenTedCruz don't #RepealAndReplace !!!
Repeal, and then let the free market replace!
Reduce regulations that drive up medical costs!
Losers all!
Sorry, but I don't believe that's an accurate statement.  Neither of these bills repeal Obamacare
Can't wait till they get rid of obama crap! It was never good here in GA
What would Jesus say about taking away healthcare from the least among us.  Pro life not after birth!
Let's replace you.
I how you're enjoying your healthcare I'm paying for. You and your family
No repeal and replace, just repeal. Worry about pre-existing conditions later.

All those people who signed up on the exchanges were showing the "personal responsibility" that you called for, and you betrayed them. SAD.
No one wants this. Fully fund the ACA.
You Republicans need to get this done.. You have seen what happens to Dems when we are upset.. They get voted out!! We are watching!!
God will avenge the oppressed.
There's nothing you could do to look less qualified.
Quit lieing your are NOT repealing it like promised
Fu
On "Special Report" tonight, Charles Krauthammer said that Trump's rhetoric "degrades the political discourse" and "embarrasses the country.
It's more constructive to talk about the benefits of your new plan than continue to put down the current plan.
Leaders rise because of their successes, not by continuously putting down others.
Mr VP I don't understand what the he!! is so hard about this. Repeal every aspect of it "Obama Care" then write a new law.
#Complicit
Can you include bloody facelifts?
They are working so hard to benefit those who don't need it!
Apparently you guys are hard of hearing - WE DON'T WANT A REPLACEMENT WE WANT A REPEAL, PERIOD!!!!
By "repeal and replace", you mean "tax cuts for the rich and F the poor"?
You should find something useful and productive to do with your time...
Go for it @VP!!!!
#SinglePayerNow
Abortion must be eradicated.
Why are u catering to insurance companies we just want health care no profit should be made or mandate
Your evil to the core.
Puke
