#NeverRubioCruzRyan
YOU are thebonly candidate I financially supported. Please work outbyour differences with Trump.
. Sir, I thank you for your service. Trump slandered a good man to win. Cruz owes him nothing. Same for me.
I AGREE Cruz owes him nothing. I want a a Hillary free presudency and he has the ability to deliver that.
"I'm not quite there yet," is Trump's shrewdest political maneuver. Makes the GOP Establishment look like feckless cowards.
come on now how bad does all the shit that Hillary has done make the dems looks? Seriously She is vile!!!
Pls set down with Trump and work out differences and get a path to defeat HRC.  Too much is at stake, I beg u to help.
@GaetaSusan @JudicialWatch   No one should be allowed to be in any country illegally
this president does not follow the law. Do something about it in the senate please. Hillary will destroy our country,
I thought towns knew better that the federal government how to use their resources.  Police are not immigration agents.
NOBODY wants you as our President. #NeverRubioCruzRyan.
what do you mean we? You are the Senator. Make something happen or shut the hell up. Have you sponsored a bill? No, go figure.
@GaetaSusan @JudicialWatch   You want back in Ted, endorse Trump. Don't steal his positions.
he is really stealing his positions, isn't he.
Then please support Donald Trump, strongly and vocally. He wants to do just this.
larry go after Hillary-shes your enemy.
.@SenTedCruz @JudicialWatch 

He has to have backing from House & Senate to do ANY of this.

So why is he able?
@dexybailman Truly Believe that what goes around comes around,the LL's & BO's will be held accountable for corruption,with rest
@JudicialWatch 2 presidents have been impeached A Johnson & Bill Clinton. Has Congress really done it's job FOR US citizens?
Why can't @GOP tie the Purse Strings SHUT to STOP Obama's Scorched Earth last few Months? Are they unwilling.
@JudicialWatch yes!!!!!!!!
@JudicialWatch please turn your supper to TRUMP. We must stand together to defeat EVIL
@JudicialWatch This is why we need #trump #Sanctuarycities #kateslaw
@2IslandJoJo @JudicialWatch And your a #Canada supporting #TPP #Traitor to the people & #Constitution #DumpCruz #DumpRyan
you may want to talk to mike lee  the dumb bastard skipped the vote
@JudicialWatch I know I live in one!!
Why can't @GOPHouse declare him Derelict n Duty,march him out of there? He's DAMAGING the Nation.
@WinnaWinna2016 @JudicialWatch maybe you should have endorsed Trump. There will be no America left if he doesn't win.
@JudicialWatch I agree but Ted is a disgrace to Texas & the GOP
Why doesn't a republican controlled house cut off funds to cities who hide illegals?? 
I hope trump cleans out the whole place.
They need to obey the Law of the Land or lose Federal funding..
@JudicialWatch How are we going to do that under a Clinton administration? #supportTrump
@JudicialWatch YOU support H1b & H2B migrants coming here. You are part of the problem! #LyingTed #Traitor #UntrusTED!
@JudicialWatch:those who provide sanctuary should then assume responsibility for the criminals acts of illegal foreign nationals
@JudicialWatch 
We agree there.  Good work.
@JudicialWatch - get on the rule of law - call out potus on Iran money being illegal .
@JudicialWatch see that's why you need to get back into the game what about the door that Obama just opened? $400 million Iran?
@JudicialWatch Cruz...hope you never run for Pres again...your RNC speech was political suiscide unless you are a democrat now?!
@JudicialWatch Cruz...so sorry that Trump hurt your feelings! Is that a good reason to break your word & vote for Hillary?
@JudicialWatch Indeed because....#AmericanLivesMatter
@JudicialWatch resign now traitor. You and your ego need to go back to Canada. Self deportation. AdiosTed!
@JudicialWatch Presidents come/go every 4-8 yrs. Supreme Court Justices are 4 life. A non-vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary.
@JudicialWatch,I'm sure Cruz didn't bring this up wile aboard Air Force 1 going to Dallas a week or so ago, perfect pportunity
@JudicialWatch https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize … – at McDonald's
Please our country needs you to have extra big shoulders and go beyond where no politician has gone before and help Donald
Senator Cruz. The GOP have the majority in the House & Senate. You control the funding. DO SOMETHING!
@JudicialWatch #immigration laws, flouted. #Drug laws, strictly enforced, news felons daily. Goal: expand democratic base
Vote your conscience ted,
The Stupid Party never learns that it should govern similarly.
The genius of progressive policy.  Talk moderately or be silent....govern radically through unelected agencies.
@JudicialWatch I thought the House has the purse strings! Kansas repudiates Brownback's wacko economics.
You are a Canadian. You got no room to talk.
Have you authored a bill to do so?
have fun if Hillary wins. She will double down on this! You should work harder to help defeat Hillary!!!
Treason and more treason, and NOTHING is done about it.  And you wonder why we have Trump.
Imagine if we Conservatives ignored federal gun laws that WE didn't like, as they do. Selective rule of law. Sad.
@JudicialWatch WAKE UP AMERICA
@JudicialWatch Senator Cruz we need you to help us win this election !
@JudicialWatch will Supreme Court matter to you if hrc wins? Way to stand for yourself
@JudicialWatch seriously, get the laws passed, support @realDonaldTrump. Its obvious your back on campaign trail....
@JudicialWatch Pull your head out Ted... And blast her publicly. Get behind Trump or we all regret it... Sooner you are onboard
@JudicialWatch I dream of a Constitutional Society where government employees defying law are invited to an impeachment hearing
The NY governor urged cities to violate federal law and the constitution #ccot
Yes. Support Trump and make it happen.
Ted you don't have much impact anymore
@JudicialWatch yes Ted and u supporting @realDonaldTrump will help us accomplish this
:(
No Shit Cruz...thanks for nothing.
@JudicialWatch , I Agree
Stop all state and Govt funds on illegal immigrants. We must stop being the money pit for FORIEGNERS. It puts Americans @ risk
@BobMetcalfe +1
@JudicialWatch don't elected officials pledged to enforce the laws what is President Obama and Congress doing?
@JudicialWatch 
If Trump wins , you can't run for 2020, that's why you don't want him to win!
@JudicialWatch this is training our kids to be law breakers, lawbreakers need to go to jail !
Thank you, Senator, for defending US sovereignty and legitimate powers of state to protect its citizens as in Medellin v. Texas
@JudicialWatch and Hillary will do worse.  Support trump !
. Trump troll with 35 followers. Buzz off
@JudicialWatch what's also 'unreal' is that you won't uphold your pledge to fully support our nominee! You could help #unify
Ted, how about looking for a new job? you're done....traitor!
Elect me, and I'll crush those cities into submission. I promise.
And I do mean ME, not you.
You quit too early.
@JudicialWatch
This is pretty hilarious! 

"If" - Stuttering Obama Remix featuring Trump https://youtu.be/poz6W0znOfk 
@JudicialWatch Obama needs to sit down and shut up he was totally inappropriate.
@JudicialWatch I thought you loved Federalism - unless it runs counter to your prejudices.
seems like this is your job to stop this.
Grants for what?
Did you award your hookers with nice tips?
@NuAgePatriot @JudicialWatch DISGUSTING
@JudicialWatch Kate's law is designed to protect citizens against criminals. That's why Dems hate it.
Indict him for Treason and solve the problem, courage and pull together it is now or it will be too late. A host of angels aid u
Treason? For respecting the Federal system you fanatics make such a deal about?
Not even the President has the right to be lawless, he too can be indicted. Sovereignty needs borders for our safety
@JudicialWatch Yes! T
you have been in senate and didn't do anything, it's time for you to go away and let the ppl who really care take responsibility
didn't you & Glenn Beck give illegals teddy bears? Frankly you awarded bad behavior
I hope you now understand how voters feel about immigration and you focus on it more for 2020.
@JudicialWatch Did you just wake up from a snooze Senator or has your head been up your ass?
@JudicialWatch Mr. Cruz: Please get your head out of your ass.
@JudicialWatch Thank you Senator Cruz, I appreciate your continued fight for this country. U R a true patriot!
DrewInDetroit you might want to seek medical help for your Cruz derangement syndrome.
yikes
@SenTedCruz
@JudicialWatch stop it! Let Trump speak for us!
Agreed. What will the Senate and House do about it?
not going to happen with your working to elect Hillary
@JudicialWatch Most incredible thing I've ever seen!
