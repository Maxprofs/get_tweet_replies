Merrick Garland
Biden Rule
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/mar/17/context-biden-rule-supreme-court-nominations/ â€¦

Biden Rule never adopted by the Senate
So what. He still said it. We applied it. How did B.O put it? Elections have consequences. We won. Deal with it.
You are right elections do have consequences #2018
Yeah - Dems have lost W.H., no House, no Senate, 1000+ seats nationwide. You getting ready to lose some more?
Didn't say that the Dems were going to take over. I simply agreed w/your point that elections have consequences. Good night
chuckling
.@SenTedCruz Obama gave you a great choice, too. That you didn't put his pick to a vote is an outrage. #DoYourJob
Oh stop - we were following the Biden Rule. B.O. had less than a year left in office. What happened was correct.
What happened was an outrage and unprecedented. Biden rule my foot.
you mean Merrick B. Garland. #DoYourJob
First Justice Gorsuch then another this summer. Clairvoyant skills prevail with our leadership 
MORNING JOE: DONALD TRUMP PREDICTED OSAMA BIN LADEN TERROR ATTACK IN 2000 1 YEAR BEFORE 9/11 #trump #msnbc #rt #MAGA 
Look 4 Justice Kennedy to retire.  Sen Cruz has contacts.
good because Ginsberg won't make 8 & prob not 4. Plus one or two others. That would translate to saving USA
thosewho say there is no right to privacy are not constitutionalists or principled-and money especially dark money is not speech
yeah, that merrick garland was a complete screwball, right?
keep fighting the good fight Sen. Cruz. You are a young guy and your destiny is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. #FuturePOTUS
hahhahahhahahha never in a million years. He lost and has made himself a patsy of Trump. He has zero integrity.

@IngmanDavid Senator Cruz keep fighting the good fight. There are more with you than against you. (1Tim6:12, 2Kings6:16-18). s
Amen.

God.  Country
you & the @GOP did such a great job with approving all Trumps cabinet picks - NOT. PRuit is a criminal. Sessions is racist.
Name calling = liberal
town halls are important, hold one
Hold a round up after all u are in Texas.,.since u r a dyno sen, extra security...ice + bps may volunteer
Ted you would sell your kids to stay relevant.
but you're ignoring Trump and his attack.  Why?
Que qu est?
After 2 terms as President. 
That's what I'm thinking
Senator we need to do what is best for our country...don't let these towns people deter you from you goals...got the approval !!
uh...that was Merrick Garland. You're gonna have a BIG fight.
Amen Senator Cruz! This should be the _only_ criteria for nominating/confirming _any_ justice to high courts.
that they care more for corporations than people?
That they adhere 2 the Constitution of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
they adhere 2 thier oath of office
meh. Merrick Garland however...
I can't wait to vote you out of office, enjoy the last two years of the ride your on. Listen to us or it's a no vote
#SANTORUM #CRUZ2024 #CRUZ2017. #TRUMP #MAGA #NEVERFORGET
Can't wait till he's canned. Not gonna happen. And how did @GovernorPerry get a cabinet spot and not you?! Ha!
He's needed in the Senate.  Y wasn't sessions voted on until after deVoss?   His vote was needed .
Of course he's needed in the senate - Rs need numbers. It's all a numbers game.
Well y did y ask.  Perry isn't a senator.  Cruz is.
Wishing you would go to #SCOTUS
appointments who are the exact opposite of the pure evil you represent would be best for America
#CRUZ2024 #CRS2017  #maga
better choice than you, #votingtexan 77035
Really? Really?
hey 45 has filed for reelection so this a campaign season and by your own logic mean no hearings can be held. Right?

Reply to @SenTedCruz Gorsuch is a LIBERAL, supported by Democrats, and will be as Bad as David Souter or Anthony Kennedy. #DumpGorsuch
The same constitutionalists who decided corps are ppl? Paving way for Exxon to invoke 1st amend right to avoid releasing docs?
Will these principled Constitutionalists uphold the emoluments clause?
I would totally back you for #SCOTUS 

I'd like to see more pressure on war crimes. We must set an example. You're a beast!! 
You decimated Bernie in the debate. Rainman on steroids, with a law degree. 
Ted, take your balls to the party. You know who Trump is. Seriously. At least you may have integrity. He has none.
by "principled constitutionalist" do you mean someone who will roll back the last remnants of campaign finance laws?
finally!
you will be voted out of office in 2018. #ICantWait

Fine and dandy, but what about the flagship promise of Republican Party - WE WILL RECALL OBAMACARE? Do you see why you lost now?

Even Dems in the past said a lame duck president shouldn't nominate for SCOTUS. #selectivememory
You are so slimy.
Save it. You have helped ruin the GOP and put Putin in the White House.  UnAmerican!!!!!!!!
so 1985
any constitution is subject to amendment like any religious text @SenTedCruz or accept ISIS as principled religionalists #CPAC2017 @FoxNews
There is a process for amendment of The Constitution; it doesn't include the judiciary.
Garbage. He ruled corporations can discriminate based on "morality".
The judge ruled which corporations?
I remember when Trump ridiculed your wife and father and you did nothing. So much for "principled" #LyinTed
Cruz ur an excuse of a man. After trump insulted ur family ur right back with him. What does that say about you
but our founders approved Constitution in 1787 @SenTedCruz and we are in 2017 No one #SCOTUS included can take us to Medieval times @CNN
It includes a way to amend it otherwise like all legal documenrmts it's means what it says.  God Country
So?  What's the holdup with him?
He is a great SCOTUS justice but so is Ted Cruz   Here I go again 
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP Do your jobs, vote on Merrick Garland first. Hypocrites otherwise. Not good for voters.
Bad kitty
you sir need to DO YOU JOB!  You are old enough to remember the Nixon mess!  There are serious concern over collusion!
THANK YOU for the respect you show towards the Constitution!
would be nice if he showed some to his constituents.
Yeah - that ship sailed with Merrick Garland.  Don't hold your breath, Count Chocula.
have you heard about #Hamilton? Apparently many #foundingfathers disagreed about the meaning of the #constitution!
So Proud Of Of U Thank U 
.@SenTedCruz 

1. You are a servile puppy dog!
2. Neil 'Fascism Forever' Gorsuch would be a great start for fascists like #Moron45
Town Hall, Town Hall, Town Hall, Town Hall, Town Hall, ass, Town Hall, Town Hall, Town Hall, Town Hall, Town Hall, #Chicken
Confirm Garland!
How about somebody who'll overturn Citizens United? That'd be great.
