@SenTedCruz  What protects woman from you? A man that cares little for woman, unless they are cooking, cleaning and pregnant and barefoot.
@SenTedCruz you're talking about lawless government when you shamed Iowans with failing voter report cards while also sharing private info.
@SenTedCruz hypocrite

@SenTedCruz You seem to be trying too hard. You won't be President.
@SenTedCruz right on. Here in NY we are trying to get something going.
@SenTedCruz I couldn't agree with you more mr. Cruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @annepaezNOLA  
If for no other reason than ~ aspirating internal organs, watching offspring slowly die,  is rather unpleasant..
@SenTedCruz  "People of the Book" God's true, final, and eternal message to humanity
@SenTedCruz First refugee we should send back is you to Canada or Cuba.  Where are you from?
@SenTedCruz It's time for a lawless Senator in violation of the natural born clause in the Constitution to withdraw.
@SenTedCruz OUR TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT IS CORRUT, A CONVENTION OF STATES IMMEDIATELY IS IMPERATIVE TO AMMEND CONSTITUTION,PUT RESTRAINTS 
@SenTedCruz following federal statute is now lawless?
@SenTedCruz Is our Cruz sinking? @realDonaldTrump says he heard a distress call.
@SenTedCruz Maybe you should introduce legislation that, if @realDonaldTrump wins, #POTUS no longer has control of nuclear weapons.
@SenTedCruz Just stop, Raphael.Just stop doing anything that isn't producing your birth certificate. Show us your BC or quit the senate now.
@SenTedCruz Cruz is Such an Idiot More So since he is the Son of Refugees
@SenTedCruz i agree we need a push for more states rights
@SenTedCruz I AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT
@SenTedCruz Senator, is it too much of a burden for Congress "to establish a uniform rule for naturalization"? #Article1Section8  @JamesA46
@SenTedCruz Or perhaps here is the issue...@JamesA46
@SenTedCruz aren't there already laws in place for this situation?
@SenTedCruz That's good but a total ban would be better. I live in a libtard state that would allow tons of this garbage in. Once in ???
@SenTedCruz amen to that! Get out of US!
@SenTedCruz
@ZarkoElDiablo @debdew2 @SenTedCruz @smartvalueblog 

Did the us embassy in Canada register Cruz birth?
@ZarkoElDiablo @SenTedCruz @smartvalueblog This is not factual. Are you able to provide validation & sources of data?
@SenTedCruz you talk like a man who never had a father who was a refugee which surprised me because you are that man who has a refugee dad
@SenTedCruz @Patriot_Girl_TX we need to help Wisconsin find a formidable representative to oust Paul Ryan first!
@Aarias1840 @SenTedCruz @Patriot_Girl_TX Paul Ryan gives USA to millions of illegals, so is Ted Cruz by voting "Free Trade & TPP" Killing us
@SenTedCruz what if you have a nut job governor like Jay inslee who would let them in anyway
@nancyoreally Read about him on Wikipedia! Very educated man. Top schools and impressive work background.
@SenTedCruz @wdmichael3 Cruz allows sharia law in Texas @IslamicTribunal & it would be USA wide if he were President. TRUMP will stop it.

@SenTedCruz You're done with all the communist ideas; even @realDonaldTrump would be better than you #iacaucus
@SenTedCruz do you think judges should be allowed to be sworn in with their hand on a book other than a bible? I Created twitter to ask this
@SenTedCruz    This is you at your most spineless. Be ashamed.
@SenTedCruz you talk about lawlessness in gov if elected are you going to reign in BLM DWR environmentalists influence in west lands
@SenTedCruz Your right Senator Cruz! Talk about lawless thugs in govt watch video  http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/01/fbi-lavoy-finicum-shooting-video-oregon/433899/ … Lawless thugs terrorize vehicle.
@SenTedCruz "Lawless thugs terrorize vehicle forcing him to flee. When he gets out of vehicle his hands up they shoot him multiple times!"
@SenTedCruz Lawless govt. thugs that forced this man to flee so they could shoot him down as he had his hands up must be held accountable!
@SenTedCruz "Another reason to keep your 2A intact! Contact State Reps. 
DEMAND lawless thugs be held accountable." http://www.senate.gov

@SenTedCruz @spyguy8080 
More meaningless grand standing.  Big talk no action.
@SenTedCruz Ok and we can start by deporting you back to Canada.and stay there!!!!!!!!
@SenTedCruz McConnell & Ryan don't have the balls to support it. States can pick the the refugees, and ship them to DC.
@SenTedCruz if you want to empower the states it's time to repeal the 17th Amendment.

#Repeal17th
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump Power to the people?  Power to each State? Stop paying extortion money to Liberals? Reduce Federal workforce!
@SenTedCruz Absolutely!
@SenTedCruz WE ALREADY HAVE IT IT IS CALLED THE US CONSTITUTION ESP THE 10TH!
@Creekredman @TBradleyNC @SenTedCruz But there are some constituents of about 19 Dem Governors who might need a reminder. 
@SenTedCruz teen titties!
@SenTedCruz will our coddled offspring any match for them?
@SenTedCruz Go home. Toss your collection of mom jeans, and please give more attention to personal hygiene.
@SenTedCruz You trade on fear. Worst type of politician. Hope you fail miserably over the next few weeks.
@SenTedCruz It's time to pass the "Put politicians in prison if they poison an entire city" act also.
@SenTedCruz Career politicians are literally killing people.
@SenTedCruz Its time to halt any refugee from coming here.
@SenTedCruz #CreepyCruz #DominionistLoon #SenPaisleyBathrobe
@SenTedCruz After last night's debate; Cruz's words ring hollow. One feels that every time he says anything; he is being manipulative.
@SenTedCruz Oh hi.
I'll take the Macitas de Puerco, an order of Mofongo, 2 ginger ales, and an extra side of black beans.
Gracias
.@SenTedCruz if @POTUS is so lawless, why no impeachment charges? why havent all Exec actions overturned by SC? (hint: bc youre lying)
