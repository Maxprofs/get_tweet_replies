is we give NAMING Rights to an international community. That's all. No takeover. Just naming rights. (2/2)
And once the UN owns those 'rights' they control what can/cannot be said.

@MicheleBachmann
the current president, that conservatives say is a dictator, hasn't done what you describe. I choose to live my life (1/3)
Obama has forced my job to stop offering insurance to my family members. He has forced me to get insurance.
and? What's the problem with you paying for your health care?
It is Authortarian for anyone to tell anyone they have to have insurance. Have it damnit or pay the fine! That is control.
bullshit. You gave to have insurance to drive a car and nobody bats an eye. You have to have insurance to own a house. Why (1/2)
I can also go around that by not owning a car. I can't go around Obamacare.
dear God woman do you have any freaking clue? We don't own the Internet and the only thing that is about to happen (1/2)
yea let's let Russia and China control the internet....that sounds like a great move.
what makes you think one developed country out of 170 should control a world wide naming system.
it's not just that. Other countries could control what we see on the internet. Stop acting like this is nothing.
that's not at all it. The name of the fucking bill specifically says it's only about transferring naming rights.
your showing your IQ for talking to a lady like that. I don't care who she is,
why is it OK for trump to repeatedly for more insult women?
I never hear him insult ladies. I dont think u can count Rosie Odonnell as a lady.
@ksandiego52 I don't think there's anything that we can do to stop him.
agree sadly he's in charge of us all
sweetie, the president cannot do anything the congress does not agree to, look it up
Right that's why he couldn't order carpet bombing in Libya... Oh wait
did u send this to me laura. it scares me& if u did I must go
The objective truth scares you?
if this is your truth then it's only truth is hate& I don't do hate. Sorry I bothered u.
I do t think you can use Twitter it doesn't seem like you can tell who's writing what
why would they even consider such a thing?
@MAGAforALL 
Internet can't be controlled!!!! Too late......
Believe me, I miss the days when, if you needed to talk to ya mama, you had to find a pay phone, or go home.
GIVING AWAY CONTROL OVER THE INTERNET CAN HARM MANY USA SMALL BIZ REQUIRED 1st CHANCE, 100% SECURE, & NO THEFT BREACHES!
KEEP CONTROL USA ASSETS.  FULL MANAGEMENT OF US ASSETS.  NO ALLOW FOR SOFTWARE BREACHES CAN OCCUR, OR LAST ON NEW DOMAINS.

@Callisto1947 JFK WAS ASSASSINATED, HE WAS A PATRIOT. ALI OBAMA IS A TRAITOR, HE IS STILL ALIVE. So much for justice.
I thought its Barack insane whos mama, first the West then he will move on 2 destroy the world
Basically, what will this mean, if he does?
Problem is, Congress hasn't had the stones to stop O'Bombbelt from ruining anything else until now.
@callisto1947 Congress needs to grow a set of balls and stand up to #ObamaTheTraitor
Ever see how a big cat squats quietly in the grass waiting to strike? There ya go!
@WordSmithGuy @WSJ would you rather Trump gives it to Putin's gqackers??
@SenTedCruz @WSJ . Well, our leaders stand with eu over US comp's, we obey un to take refgs, maybe there's a trend? OWO?
What can the people do to stop this?
@WordSmithGuy @WSJ hello Venezuela need help now please
@SenTedCruz By doing this they can shut down all communications from Americans to Americans. Very, very bad move.
Why would we give this away?  No amount of money is worth that.
