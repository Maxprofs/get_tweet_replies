@SenTedCruz @roadtoserfdom3 So how does Cruz get off supporting laws that criminalize actions with no valid corpus?! #clueless
@Jake_Witmer @SenTedCruz Have you decided on a candidate yet?
@roadtoserfdom3 @SenTedCruz http://mcafee2016.com  @officialmcafee is the only person running in 2016 who has human-level intelligence.
@Jake_Witmer @SenTedCruz @officialmcafee Plus, he is gonna hunt me down otherwise. lol
@roadtoserfdom3 @SenTedCruz @officialmcafee ...Online doesn't matter as much as meatspace until June 01. ;)
@SenTedCruz Thomas Jefferson wouldn't like you #LyinTED. Your problem is your personality. Once people get to know you, they don't like you.
@ThomasSSchmitz @SenTedCruz Jefferson would love Ted. He is the only person running that defends the Constitution 100%. #cruzcrew #TrusTed
@pollak_rachel Jefferson would hate a lawyer (#LyinTED) who argued against a USA Worker & instead argued for China who stole the USA patent.
@ThomasSSchmitz  Cruz played a minor roll, but stood against the cowardly Congress for Texas and the Constitution. He is a true conservative
@pollak_rachel We're approaching a post ideological America. It's not conservative vs. liberal. #LyinTED's old-line frame of reference loses
@ThomasSSchmitz Cruz stand for what America was ment to be. If you dont believe that, than your the one Jefferson wouldn't like. #VoteCruz
@pollak_rachel @ThomasSSchmitz
@fun_nyvines @ThomasSSchmitz I agree @fun_nyvines . Just defending Cruz.
We need to teach students in school who Jefferson is coz progressives have been brainwashing them for way too long .
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @roadtoserfdom3 So...that failed.
@planetaryjim @SenTedCruz You mean politicians didn't voluntarily limit themselves, of course. This is not a huge surprise.
@roadtoserfdom3 @SenTedCruz Somehow those with power never notice limits to their power. Take Allen Dulles murdering JFK, e.g. Ted's dad ...
@roadtoserfdom3 @SenTedCruz ..had his photo taken with Lee Harvey Oswald. Get a few drinks in him, he'll tell you all about it. lol
@SenTedCruz @Jake_Witmer "[The #Constitution] has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it."
@dnwiebe @SenTedCruz ...it's the latter. Which explains "the unconstitutionality of slavery" by Spooner
@SenTedCruz yet u support and profit from a party's control, a system that the people's vote doesn't matter
@SenTedCruz follow constitution in regards to "Natural Born Citizen" what you said in 2013 about not being eligible is still true
.@SenTedCruz hey you do know that the Constitution protects the rights of Muslim citizens like me, right? I know you hate that.
@SenTedCruz @patriot101 Amen

@SenTedCruz
Cruz lies. Cruz lies. Cruz lies. Cruz lies. Cruz lies. Cruz lies!
Hard to believe his own kids are even his! No balls.

@SenTedCruz This Former Republican’s Viral ‘Tribute To Obama’ Is Exactly Why The GOP Is Doomed (VIDEO) http://winningdemocrats.com/this-former-republicans-viral-tribute-to-obama-is-exactly-why-the-gop-is-doomed-video/ …

@SenTedCruz  President Thomas Jefferson dealt with the deviant behaviors of the MUSLIM CULT. #piracy #slavery #BarbaryCoast GO NAVY.
@SenTedCruz I agree with Jefferson but LYIN'TED uses the constitution for self Power. A Puppet to   WS, GS, Globalist like the RNC & Bushes.
@SenTedCruz Sir, after the sex toy ban, you cannot use "chains" or "bind" ever again if you want to be taken seriously. Haha.
@SenTedCruz I believe you are a false prophet. Look towards yourself to see just how many lies you tell.
@SenTedCruz You mean mischief like the bullshit voter disenfranchisement in Colorado?  That kind that you embraced?  THAT kind of mischief?
@SenTedCruz @JAmy208 so why break it senator Cruz
@SenTedCruz you keep using that quote. I don't think it means what you think it means.
@SenTedCruz this from the guy using loopholes like water
@SenTedCruz Agreed 
@SenTedCruz Did you read the same quote I did? He says MAN, not GOVERNMENT. The #Constitution IS the government.
@rstackjr The #Constitution is not the government. The Constitution is the rules that the government must follow. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Well Mr Cruz you really should take your own advice
@SenTedCruz To bad 4 the people the #establishment pols don't follow the #Constitution
@SenTedCruz I never see Trump stand up for the Constitution like Ted does. One of the many reasons why I'm for Cruz.
@SenTedCruz cruz  talks about democracy and how the people's  vote counts then screws the people in Colorado of their votes! What a POS!
@SenTedCruz Ted  why are you supporting a rapist. Duh!
@SenTedCruz :) @MittRomney
@SenTedCruz  - Let's celebrate by raising our bowls of Macaroni and Cheese.
@SenTedCruz keep fighting
@SenTedCruz @SandFostcat  Thomas Jefferson would have never supported TPP #LyingTed #globalisttraitor #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
@SenTedCruz Are you a glutton for punishment?
@SenTedCruz But Obama is upset as Constitution is a set of negative liberties. Things the gov can't do to you. Imagine where we'd be w/o it!
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz 24TH AMENDMENT READ IT LOVE IT AND LIVE WITH IT CAUSE IT GOT YOU. AND YOU'LL NEVER FORGET (COLORADO) AGAIN.
@SenTedCruz don't cut food stamps. Make people work for food stamps! Planned Parenthood saves tax payer medical expenses. True Conservatives
@SenTedCruz You are the best Candidate in this race Ted, we love your Tax Plan Proposal.
@SenTedCruz Your quotes are anemic like you, and your advisors are not better. If you are hoping to tear jerk us, you failed miserably Jeez
@SenTedCruz You mean mischief like making up rules about when you don't have to appoint a Supreme Court judge?

@SenTedCruz This man believed that all men are created equal!
@SenTedCruz Which is more obscene T Cruz on the same page as Jefferson or HRC citing Jefferson? Bourbon on election night
@SenTedCruz He also said "Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry."
@SenTedCruz if the #Constitution means so much, then why do you neglect you job? Your nothing but a false prophet, you speak lies. Jer 9:5
@SenTedCruz I heard u were coming back to San Diego. U have got to reach out to the latinos. The radio station 90.3 is owned by Mexico.
@SenTedCruz i heard it myself today, very pro Mexico & brainwashing (90.3). Hilary will get their votes easy. Pleez try harder! May God blss
@sentedcruz Not American in your previous state...
@SenTedCruz aren't you misquoting Jefferson? Doesn't it say - Put your faith in men, but bind them down...
@SenTedCruz #corrupted Jefferson would be ashamed of u #soldoutpolitician #antiAmerican AIPAC & Israel lover
@SenTedCruz Every liberal should read this over and over and over and...
@SenTedCruz Pastor Teddy finally giving us a word on something he knows a lot about-The mischief of government. Green eggs and ham!
@SenTedCruz I'm sure that unlike Cruz, Jefferson would support a person's right to buy a dildo.
@SenTedCruz Yes it is. Thankyou, Sen. Cruz, for helping to bind that mischief.
Thank you for protecting that document and thereby ourselves.
@SenTedCruz You Are ok untill you speak
@SenTedCruz and where are the chains that will bind your mischief #LyingTed?

@SenTedCruz And to chain those in positions of government and their allies from denying the American people the RIGHT to choose their leader
@sentedcruz OBAMACARE IS LAW AND PROTECTED BY CONSTITUTION NOW. SOMETHING YOU DONT PROTECT FOR SELFISH REASONS.
@SenTedCruz How 'bout confirming a Judge..
@SenTedCruz Like you were ever planning on sticking to checks and balances.
@SenTedCruz Mam of characters tweet perfect words & pure & no negative impact; godlyman hate corruption.It's our Constitutional Conser Cruz.
@SenTedCruz As an evangelical I think a discussion of #constitutionalvalues will be more productive than defending Christian values.
@SenTedCruz by that measure YOU should be dragging a bunch of them behind you..
@SenTedCruz so that you can plan your own zealotry-based mischief
@SenTedCruz are you selling your soul and country?  How much?  Must be millions.
@SenTedCruz I would like to know why you thought you had the right to post a nude pic of Donald Trump's wife on the internet?  SHAME ON YOU!
@SenTedCruz

@SenTedCruz oh please rules or not you're subverting the will of the people stop disgracing our founding fathers #tcot
@SenTedCruz Is a lyin cheatin pos! People actually want to vote in this globalist pos? People need to pull their collective heads outta ass!
@SenTedCruz Here's an idea: Remind Conservative Stockholders that CEO's are beholden to us, they are not being paid to take (con)
@SenTedCruz (cont) Controversial stances , they are paid to keep their companies profitable to pay US The Stockholders!
@SenTedCruz And CEO's saying that "Trans" boys can be in girls school locker rooms is just stupid as well as dangerous!
@SenTedCruz Parents have a right to make sure their kids are safe, CEO's don't have a right to say that they do not!
@SenTedCruz why do you hate Italians and you're calling all of us Michael Corleone?
@Jim_S_Jersey @SenTedCruz yea thats racist or stereotyping
@SenTedCruz so funny this quote was directed by Jefferson himself at people like you!
@SenTedCruz Needed words of wisdom in these trying times. I am with you because of @CarlyFiorina Had to get in a shout out
@SenTedCruz shut down the gov and hopes to set up theocratic Christian fascism : the opposite of Jefferson who wanted religion out of gov.
@h_conover @SenTedCruz Actually he is a phonie christian that talks christianeze, with zero, to show 4 it! Can't make a sentence w out lying
@SenTedCruz unless it's the fourth amendment right?
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump so why is it, Ted, that you dropped the ball in defending Trump's right to free speech in Chicago?
