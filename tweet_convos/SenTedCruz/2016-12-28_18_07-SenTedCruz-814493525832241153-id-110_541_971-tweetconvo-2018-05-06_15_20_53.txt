@SenTedCruz understanding genocide does not make one an enemy of Israel.
@tedcruz is a failure!  President Reagan would think of you a a complete failure!  Think of that #LyingTed
Remove USA from UN! Kick UN out of USA!
@SenTedCruz Obama and Kerry are on the correct side
of the ONE world order?  WRONG!
@tedcruz Remember back when Ted was a relentless enemy of Trump
@TheTrumpLady This is #obama's "tyrant tantrum" against those who's genuine leadership shows his to be absent. He's immature!
@Shimmyfab This administration will go down as the most anti Jew in history.
You're 100% right, as usual. I hope you had a Merry Christmas & will have a healthy, prosperous New Year!
What a great legacy for Obama.
History will also record Obama's flat out lies that he was pro-Israel - among his many other lies and half-truths. So be it.
thank you Ted Cruz for calling the kettle black! More of this should come from the GOP!
Obama is a Muslim raised in Indonesia. They want to destroy Israel and U.S.A. He is not who he claim to be. He is a fraud.
@tedcruz and @SenTedCruz is a traitor to the USA
Nope, sanity against all of you religious kooks. Tell us about the hookers, Ted.
Obama and Kerry support the 2 state option.  They hope it brings peace to EVERYONE. Stop spreading hate.
You need you to do your homework , your twisted on the truth.
Elizabeth is actually correct
No she's not.Israel brought the 2 state up 4 tines in since 1997. Palestinian refused Obama is evil
lmao -- thanks for the nonsense response
@tedcruz end the 2 state solution,  no peace has EVER come from it and never will. Palestine wants Israel dead.
Yes I believe it@

@tedcruz and as the worst POTUS ever in the history of the US.
Yes & history will record obama as the worst President ever!
Relentless? The only thing that's remotely relentless is @tedcruz's sad attempt to stay in the political spotlight.
@tedcruz I just love it. I will bask in the thought of OBAMA's FAILED presidency.
@tedcruz I know Israel will prevail- the word has promised to uphold her.
@tedcruz almost time to get things done to help our country

@SenTedCruz : And enemies of America & the Constitution.

@tedcruz liars who believe their own lies. Astounding how deluded the Obama administration is.
@tedcruz Disband the Un!

@tedcruz more divisive rhetoric - please stop.  Ted you are know for being the troll of politics and this doesn't help.
Sure, relentless enemies who awarded >$3 bil/year in foreign aid/year for 10 years. Once again, Cruz is lying.
Yet dumb American Jews keep supporting Democrats.....go figure
@SenTedCruz for someone who hates fidel so much its funny you choose to side with other dictators?
#notmypresident the MuzzRats Loving Obama Knifes #Israel in the back. @TimesofIsrael @tedcruz #Israel #UniteBlue #1A

It depends. According to the MSM, Obama's radical views supporting terrorists are the American peoples view. WRONG
Stand a firm Sen Cruz We pray for you * Israel
Freedom is an anathema to the Obamanites.
After Iraq and Syria
on to Jerusalem.
@tedcruz
@tedcruz of course Obama is an enemy to Israel, he is definitely for supporting the Muslim Brotherhood.
@SenTedCruz keep retweeting the propaganda senator...
one of many titles those two will be called now and in the future
too bad that the #fakenews lied saying @TheDemocrats were the friends of Israel when it was @SenTedCruz & @realDonaldTrump
@tedcruz Wow, u really woke up. Kerry and King Obama is going to put us in a war we can't win. Congress need to stop them now
@tedcruz puleeeez
Why does @tedcruz care more about Israel than the USA?  Owned by Jews? #Zionist.
Every time Cruz opens his mouth I think of Joe McCarthy
History will record Ted Cruz as a spineless enabler of Donald Trump and a generally dishonest, exploitive politician.
.@TimesofIsrael .@SenTedCruz #NOT
Good, it's time we brought and end to this #Zionism. Israel is illegitimate. #AmericaFirst
@SenTedCruz you can't a Muslim and like Israel. Just isn't possible. Obama has been against Israel since day 1
@SenTedCruz both been a disgrace! Can't wait until Mr Trump takes power
@tedcruz @TimesofIsrael they have always been an enemy. They are just making it obvious now
Moronic Israelis, trumpeting Lyin' Ted Turdlick's bullshit baloney lies.

Kudos!!
for sure!  I would not want to be either of them when they "stand" before GOD!
they dont like people to live in peace!
not a surprise 2 antisemites and one Muslim friend of Iran
Treacherous and deceitful, those two. Stiff-necked and strong-headed. May God remember their evil conspiracy against Israel.
and don't forget Ted, our heavenly Father has a  good memory too. I sure wouldn't want to be Kerry and Obama Judgement Day!!
In the meantime, a Trump DOJ can investigate Obama's ties to terrorist organizations & prosecute him if found.
you are living off the BACKS OF US taxpayers
enemy of illegal Israeli settlements u mean. But Netanyahu will create the next war with Palestinians and whoever else joind
Jimmy Carter, Obama and Kerry new American leadership of Anti Semites. Kerry should be ashamed
obama is a leaderless coward of epic proportion
AMEN!
Better described as manipulated by JStreet, who supported Dem candidates successfully but who don't support Israel.
@SenTedCruz I'll remind u when karma avenges your support for Israel. It will be your family. Don't forget. I will remind you
                                          
Ridiculous.
Laughed out loud thinking about how history will record Cruz.
38 billion reasons that isn't true.
America supports Israel!
