@SenTedCruz I hope your followers are smarter than you: http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 
@SenTedCruz I guess @rebel_coder missed this: German Prof Examines Massively Altered NASA GISS Temperature Datasets: http://notrickszone.com/2015/11/20/german-professor-examines-nasa-giss-temperature-datasets-finds-they-have-been-massively-altered/ …
@get2thegulch @SenTedCruz If only you could see through the fog the rest of us see as bias: http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/11/05/climate_data_lamar_smith_and_adjusting_scientific_data.html …
@rebel_coder @SenTedCruz Slate? Really? HA!
@get2thegulch @SenTedCruz @BadAstronomer Quite the difference between advice from a world renown Astronomer, and an ignoramus.
@rebel_coder Climate Alarmists rely on highly unreliable models & highly manipulated data to promote leftist agenda http://www.c3headlines.com/science-factevidence/page/3/ …
@SenTedCruz But #climatechange supported by an overwhelming consensus of the world's climate scientists for decades! You're being cynical.
@proxybattles15 @SenTedCruz so what...the climate is changing as it always has...the idiocy is that the government can fix it
@PBertucelli @SenTedCruz That's a different argument.  On that, yes, the climate changes, goes through cycles, etc. . . BUT . . .
@proxybattles15 @SenTedCruz thats nonsense...nobody was paying attention a thousand years ago...keep worshiping your government!
@PBertucelli @SenTedCruz I don't really understand your response.  I'm talking about geological science and public policy.
@SenTedCruz you wouldn't known a "scientific conclusion" if it was waving it's arms and screaming in your face.
@bpt326 @SenTedCruz well how about u paying 4 what u believe in? # U PAY 4 HOAX
@dobermankahn @SenTedCruz science is a hoax? I refuse to pay for your ignorance.
@bpt326 @SenTedCruz so Leftist want to tax Air.. Climate change HOAX..#Sun flares& Volcanoes Trump Human influence
@dobermankahn @SenTedCruz you are free to live in a state of denial but it doesn't change the science or the facts.
ur denial is a religion
@SenTedCruz then you are an outright liar and hypocrite. As a Harvard grad you should be smart enough to understand physics and #climate sci
@PegMitchell1 @SenTedCruz oh? How much personal degrowth are u willing to give??
@dobermankahn @SenTedCruz false equivalence if you mean fixing climate harms the economy. The real cost is in not acting.
@PegMitchell1 @SenTedCruz how dumb and gullible can u be. Is man more powerful than the sun, than volcanoes? Scoop money ur pocket 2 another
@dobermankahn @SenTedCruz if u care learn something, maybe with open mind here's one report that shows how it works http://bit.ly/1pYH7Mj 
@SenTedCruz Cruz Says " Don't Believe Scientists on Climate Change, Believe Me"
@SenTedCruz and since 99% of scientists agree that the threat is real and imminent, why continue to be paid off to fight it?
@SenTedCruz Cruz/GOP could care less about protecting the Environment and clean energy
@SenTedCruz @Herfarm “Massively Altered” …German Professor Examines NASA GISS Temperature Datasets http://notrickszone.com/2015/11/20/german-professor-examines-nasa-giss-temperature-datasets-finds-they-have-been-massively-altered/ …
@SenTedCruz I'm glad you're investigating the Bible of the Climate Change religion and the prophets who have created a lucrative industry
@SenTedCruz GOP waste taxpayer $ on Blocking/ Creating Bills 2 NOT Combat Climate Change
@SenTedCruz @SarahPalinLinks The science is well settled only by the people who make a living selling us on predictions that proved wrong
@SenTedCruz They are based on Science not Democrats. Duhhh.
@SenTedCruz @CruzinAhead Correct! Are we not in a "pause" stage for nearly two decades now? Maybe @algore would know? #TrusTed
@FranklinMan25 @SenTedCruz Exactly, they'll say anything for more govt control over everything we do. Scary how crazy @algore almost POTUS!
@CruzinAhead @SenTedCruz @algore 2/2: HIS BOOK HAD INTERESTING PICTURES, & what seemed like scientific evidence. Scam!!! We need #Cruz!
@SenTedCruz BET ON MR STEYN, http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/04/mark-steyn-testify-congress-global-warming/ ….. Religion of GREEN HAS 2 B EXPOSED, what Melted T Glaciers 100k ago FARTS OF MAMMOTHS
@SenTedCruz um... are you that ignorant or just deluded? #idiot
@SenTedCruz Since many organizations sell  " indulgences" for this religion it would be interesting to investigate ties to Climate prophets
@SenTedCruz or the illusion the right lives by
@SenTedCruz yes they should be based on science, not your donations from the coal/oil/gas companies
@SenTedCruz 180 countries, basically the world is wrong, but Conservative Americans are right, sure.
@SenTedCruz correct, should be based on the data and reports from 98% of the worlds leading climate scientists. #facts
@Chewcipher Cruz a denier in many areas-thinks he's running against Obama meanwhile Trump wins from terrorism fears@
@SenTedCruz Are you KIDDING ?
@SenTedCruz There is data; some  97% scientists agree. Climate change refutes false prophets of capital consumerism. You deny prophets.
@SenTedCruz Were you aware of this, sir?  https://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/12/08/exposed-academics-for-hire/ …

#science #climatechange #ActOnClimate #peoplesclimate
@SenTedCruz &98% scientists agree CLIMATE change manmadw.Generals say immineot threat is CLIMATE change causing famine &uprisings.
@SenTedCruz You mean like the Pentagon?  DOD?  http://Climate.org ?  If your IQ were 2 points lower, you'd BE a tree.
@SenTedCruz Check w/ Dept of Defense/CIA they claim climate change is real and will cause destabilizing of areas around the globe-terrorism
@SenTedCruz I was just a liberal issue then countries around the globe wouldn't agree we have a problem.
@SenTedCruz Cruz/ GOP created Energy Committee 2 WASTE TAXPAYER $ to Argue And Fight Scientist on Climate Change
@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber Obama has his hand in the Climate Control for the money not our future.
@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber  Global warming is a religion. You can't argue with the true believers they have concrete for brains.
@SenTedCruz what about leftists feelings???
@SenTedCruz For the record, Senator Cruz, there are thousands of scientific conclusions based on evidence & data that prove climate change!
@SenTedCruz CO2 is not a pollutant, it is necessary for all life. The more the better. Botany 101.
@SenTedCruz Right on. When they could no longer support Global Warming because of facts, they resort to changing the term to Climate Change
@SenTedCruz. I think there should be an investigation into why you are so stupid and getting paid 174k a year
@SenTedCruz while we're at it lets reignite the debate on the sun being the centre of the universe
@SenTedCruz 
One of the reasons why i hate the US...is how dumb their politicians sound... Like this one!
@SenTedCruz Greedy Obstructionist Pirates lie PERIOD. Who should we believe lying GOP deniers or educated Scientists? GOP mislead people
@SenTedCruz how can't you talk about the Creator of Earth, and destroy it at the same time?  That's the hoax, you tool.
@SenTedCruz “As the son of scientists”, you more than most should understand the need to look at ALL the data… #NoMoreCherryPicking
@SenTedCruz TY Senator! WE, the MAJORITY, already KNOW there is NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE supporting global warming! Polar Ice NEVER thicker!
@SenTedCruz  Your statement contradicts itself.
@sentedcruz Environment is changing. Mountains rise a little each year.. vallys sink a little more. Not theory, but actual facts.
@SenTedCruz @ConserValidity. Science is based on skeptical inquiry. Religion based on dogma. How would you classify the "AGW" disciples?
7000 YEARS AGO THE AREA AROUND THE NILE WAS A FORREST BUT THE EARTH GOES THROUGH CYCLES- EVEN BEFORE SUVs! @SenTedCruz @ConserValidity
The Earth has not warmed in 22 years- but what do facts have to do with an agenda to milk people like cows! @SenTedCruz @ConserValidity
Global Luke Warm-Is serious- Cow Farts & SUVs -are a planet killers!! @SenTedCruz @ConserValidity
@SenTedCruz You are to smart to believe this bullshit you say, so STOP SAYING IT!
@SenTedCruz Yes true but #ClimateChange is 2% Science 98% Scientology you know you can't outlaw a whacky religion.
@SenTedCruz are you so utterly stubborn & clueless you can't see facts?
@SenTedCruz  Look at this before you take his bunk quotes from Hanna & Sarah scientists.
@SenTedCruz It's a PROVEN fact! You aren't a scientist so get over yourself. Look at Japan. They have to wear face masks!
@SenTedCruz You're part of the problem.  Get out of the way.
@SenTedCruz Or is it just be paid to lie?
@SenTedCruz 
Go get 'em.  So funny to see you dismantle these guys.
@SenTedCruz Agenda21
@SenTedCruz Or the paid for phony research of the manufactured controversy liars.
@SenTedCruz unfortunately you and science are strangers.
@SenTedCruz Exactly Ted.  Changing the climate is my pet project -- don't let anyone interfere with it!
@SenTedCruz Mr President,I would like to see people address Fukushima, which is still doing its radiation dumping.
@SenTedCruz what evidence and data do you have that no scientists seem to have?
@SenTedCruz So, explain this simple fact concerning Marshall Islands?  http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/02/world/The-Marshall-Islands-Are-Disappearing.html?_r=0 … #ClimateSummit #climatechange
@SenTedCruz They are afraid of facts. Or will twist them to fit.
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis We know uncle Ted we know!
@SenTedCruz It was much warmer during the Renascence when humanity thrives as never before. None of the things we are blaming even existed.
@SenTedCruz @Chairmnoomowmow has nothing to do with #NationalSecurity as @POTUS wants us to believe
Get with the Program, Ted. 



@SenTedCruz @Chairmnoomowmow
@SenTedCruz And by "liberal global warming alarmists" you mean the world's top scientists and every other first world leader? #sad #lies
@SenTedCruz hope you realize that for every whiny brat on twitter, there are 10 reasonable adults in real world ready to restore America
@SenTedCruz Global warming is based on evidence and data. You're a fucking lunatic that shouldn't be allowed to hold office as a dog catcher
@SenTedCruz perhaps you ought to read some facts, believe them then act rationally. Sadly you would not know a fact even if it bit you.
@SenTedCruz ok then offer some data already
@SenTedCruz GO GET THEM CHAMP ! J.W
@SenTedCruz Yeah! I'll be damned if those liberals are going to take away my right to flood the atmosphere with CO2!
@blobert Flooding? Enable geo-location, tweet @petajkt #banjir and check http://petajakarta.org  1449093631782
@SenTedCruz Left conveniently ignores science when it doesn't back their agenda:  climate change, life in womb, gender reassignment...
@SenTedCruz No global warming in 18 years. It's all nonsense for carbon tax. Brainwash, then get your money.
@SenTedCruz Cruz is right about the climate change hoax and that most criminals are Democrats. King Obama is a classic example of corruption
@SenTedCruz The climate change hoax is all about making money for the mostly Democrat owners of green energy companies who support liars.

@SenTedCruz Most people already know you wont listen to evidence. But you cannot claim to have access to actual science
.@SenTedCruz By "liberal global warming alarmists," you mean the entire scientific and business community, right?
@SenTedCruz like the evidence of Big Oil lying about it for 4 decades or something else?
@SenTedCruz can't stop laughing long enough to respond but that is funny Ted. Lol
@SenTedCruz You should really come forward and let the world know the real motives are redistribution of wealth and control. CC is horsecrap
@SenTedCruz In China, the communist party indoctrinates us with the Marxian "Scientific Socialism", as if it were really scientific.
@SenTedCruz @katypillar70 97% of climatologists think AGW is real.  100% of illiterate retarded conservatives think it's not.
@SenTedCruz this has got to be the dumbest tweet ever and that’s tough considering how many dumb tweets you post a day.
@SenTedCruz Andrew Klavan tackles this beautifully as well. http://youtu.be/qldJRY5aGaA 
@SenTedCruz 
The world is not warming! 3% of scientist backed by oil companies and billionaires said so!!! Duhh
@SenTedCruz Like peer-reviewed science Ted?
@SenTedCruz And if you don't like the data, you can always just take funding from NASA. Don't you just love this job? I do.
@SenTedCruz Oh please tell me more about the science!
@SenTedCruz 352 mass shootings this yr, and you are focused on bashing the president?  Get your priorities in order; you will never be POTUS
@SenTedCruz more than 99% of the people that quote the 97% of scientists can't name the most potent greenhouse gas.
@SenTedCruz It's been a new witch hunt for long. Ivar Giaever, Freeman Dyson and Frederick Seitz expressed their doubt but ended up smeared.
@SenTedCruz Conservatives choose not to believe the science.  Why would you want to see Earth die for your beliefs? @EnviroNewsTV
@SenTedCruz Mass shooting San Bernadino CA.Scene active. shooters escaped in SUV
@SenTedCruz It is. You are just choosing not to believe facts.
AMEN @SenTedCruz #GrassRoots with NOT capitulate to progressive's #ClimateCon!!
@SenTedCruz then I suggest you start reading ted
@SenTedCruz Start by asking about the raw data: only 15% stations met min. standards, 50+% of data 'extrapolated'. http://www.texaspolicy.com/blog/detail/obama-should-play-with-an-open-hand-in-paris-climate-talks …
@SenTedCruz #Team_Officer_Dillard
@SenTedCruz I'd like to work armed security for you while in NYC is that possible? 
I need new and better supporters and sponsors
@SenTedCruz Nothing you say smacks of logic of reason.
@SenTedCruz hi, Ted!
@SenTedCruz There is no lack of proof and evidence. Denying facts and being in big oil's pocket (and Goldman's) should not get you elected.
@SenTedCruz or on the fact that they will lose federal funding. No Climate Change. No research dollars. Duh!
@SenTedCruz you can't run that committee, you're not a scientist!
@SenTedCruz By the way, Svante Arrhenius was also a board member of an institute of eugenics -  Svenska sällskapet för rashygien.  2/2
@SenTedCruz When Obama and left can change Polar Shift, stop Volcano's, stop Solar Flares, then I'll be impressed. They have junk science
@SenTedCruz Thanks to Svante Arrhenius, who misused Stefan-Boltzmann law to derive his greenhouse law. 1/2
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz Ted's uninformed...or informed by KOCH donations.
@SenTedCruz Hey dummy, 97% of REAL scientists believe it...U need to quit pandering to the coal industry.
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz no matter how many people agree with something (97% = BS) doesn't make it true.
@WinnDuncan @SenTedCruz Just another RWNJ chiming in, I see. Just what the hell it would it take if you can't believe the mass of scientists
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz how many were surveyed?  What questions were asked.
@WinnDuncan @SenTedCruz There have been several. I'd look them up but you'd just deny them so bugger off.
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz water vapor.
@SenTedCruz i pray for you and my hopes for a real conservative leader
@SenTedCruz You're a Dominionist talking about scientific evidence? Wow. #PaisleyBathrobe.
@SenTedCruz dad
@NewMexicoAmLg @SenTedCruz We can't talk about this thing! IT'S SETTLED SCIENCE!! Everyone SHUTUP!!
