Thank you Satan!
You equate consume choice with Satan?  Are you being held in North Korea?  We will try to get help to you.
You are welcome little Kim Jung
Sick burn, bro. That's a dick in your ear, not a banana.
Your level of discourse is par for the average leftist; very average.
You are more left than I am. Try again snowflake.
Left?  You are crazy.  I have been proudly conservative/libertarian my entire life.  Try again.
Destabilize the American healthcare market.  What could possibly go wrong?
How does offering consumer choice destabilize the market?  I suppose having more than one car company destabilizes the automotive market
The likelihood of dramatically altering the composition of the risk pool(s)
So if we are all in a car heading over a cliff, it is safer to stay in the car rather than jump out?
Shame on all of you for happily selling your country to Russia.
You aren't doing what's right for Americans. 
You're paid by billionaires.
We were just following Hillarys example when she sold 20% of our uranium reserves to Russia.  She is quite the little trailblazer.
How do you figure?  My insurance has always had a maximum cap on what I would pay in a single year.  Do you live in Venezuela?
This constituent endorses Trump's removal from office ASAP. What are you doing about his collusion w Russia? Nothing else matters now.
Name the section and how it applies.  What evidence of any crime do you have?  Digging up dirt on Hillary is not actually a crime.
How about consumer freedom regarding liability insurance or home insurance.  Why should I pay for freeloaders in the health care market?
get a clue..even before ACA we paid for others. Go to ER, no insurance, little money, file for financial assistance through hospital
taxpayers pay. quit acting like these people who r less fortunate r free loaders & quit acting like u don't know people that r lucky to pay
their bills. r there those that take advantage, yes but the people out there busting their asses living paycheck to paycheck far out way the
"free loaders" No matter how many times they change insurance we taxpayers will always pay for less fortunate. I for one would prefer the
best affordable insurance for all.
Another reason for repealing O'Care, questions from healthcare providers the day of a procedure. How does gun ownership effect treatment?
I saw you say Americans don't care about #TrumpRussiaCoverUp apparently you are not paying attention.  WE CARE! #TheResistanceGQ
I'm guessing you don't ever plan on running again because those sound bites are going to come back and bite you big time. And oh yes we care
These ppl want Americans to die. So Sad Cruz amendment would allow plans to waive things protects people with pre-existing conditions.

American Cancer Society, AARP and nearly a dozen other orgs slam Cruz health proposal: "A betrayal of the commitment to protect Americans." 


JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 

New #Trumpcare is even worse. Insurers can trick you to get a plan that doesn't cover you if you get sick. That's not insurance. It's fraud. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/885516734320529412 …

#socialmeda Go Cruz! #GOP majority in House & Senate ran on repeal of failing O-care, Reps who vote No on Repeal need to be Replaced in 18!

The BlueCross BlueShield Association, a bigger player in the individual insurance market, has also come out against the Cruz plan. 
You guys do your job & repeal Obamacare & get Sen. Mitch McConnell to start supporting the President of the United States or lose your jobs.
removing 10 benefits essential to actually surviving illness/injury- tricking low info voters into early graves? Ur selling WEALTHCARE.
Full repeal of Obamacare as promised! Nothing less!
Then he needs to go to the Senate floor and demand a repeal bill
Finally, repeal ACA. We have healthcare systems work on fixing,investigate fraud&reforming Medicaid/Medicare;which are 4 poor,disabled&aged
To be involved in this country by continuing to "sell us out", so will we lose our freedoms AND our country to Russia. They have infiltrated
Just as our ancestors in this country murdered and took away the land from the Indians, if we continue on this road of allowing Russia......
let them opt out but we still pay for them when they go to er, don't have insurance, little money, file financial assistance, taxpayers pay
I think it would b smart to have a healthcare that is good & affordable for all. Taxpayers pay no matter how u spin it!
I'm going to be voting with the democrats in 2020 if little t is not removed from office!  #IMPEACH #INDICTMENT #PRISON
Stand up to Russian Collusion! Send a message!
Get your head out of your "butt" because this is one republican that is concerned about the Russia issue and you had better get a CLUE!!
You are now also selling out this country by your stinking support of little t.  What's this crazy talk that people are not talking Russia?
I will NEVER vote for you again should it be a choice!  You need to pay attention to John McCain who I wrote in his name last fall.
You have met with little t at the WH TWICE now for dinner. What hoods does he have on you that you now say these things?
That's "goods" and not hoods.  Little t has you wrapped around his little finger.  Wake up or lose your senate seat in the future!
I voted for you in the primary last summer!  What has happened to the man who called "little t" trump a narcissist?  Why are you sucking up?
What's the matter with your brain Ted???  Appeasement by Obama??   And Trump us NOT appeasing Putin?   You better open your eyes and ears!!
More evidence shows Obamacare is getting healthier, but will that stop the GOP wrecking crew?

Ted Cruz was just pressed again and again by @kasie on Trump-Russia. His answers are worth a watch. (via @MSNBC) 

All bullshit. We need a single payer system.
You know your bill stinks. https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/884955616472514560 … The treasonous fool will be a convenient scape goat when the time comes. #TRAITORS
"The fundamental narrative of this story has shifted," @RyanLizza says -- here's why  
To late for you though, changing parties won't change who you are
Joe Scarborough announces he's leaving Republican party: report http://hill.cm/BY4OXR0  
Good man.  I left in Bush's second term.
Trump & Pence both need to hit the road & let the American ppl know about this. Force Senators to support it.
All Congressmen who vote out OC without a replacement should be denied healthcare themselve.
Pence.  All mouth, no action.
Mike Pench has NOTHING to offer to replace OC.  WE ARE NOT STUPID!  GET REAL PENCH!
Nice job Vice President Cruzs plan is the most sane and keeps us away from single payer health
The Republican Party is willing to win at any cost. Laws and ethics be damned.
this is a great proposal.  It truly creates options and choice.  Conservative ideas work.
https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/884955616472514560 … Conservative ideas like collusion with a foreign government hostile to America? #GOP = Guardians of Putin. #Sad.
"The fundamental narrative of this story has shifted," @RyanLizza says -- here's why  

Sounds like it's something everyone can get behind and they should be doing it now not later!
Go all the way. Let your neighbor's home burn... it won't burn your home down too. Let Grandma die, money is more important ... right? #Sad
Wow! The VP? Hahahaha
Glad to hear this b'cuz I've serious questions about @VP true conservative bona fides based on Indiana RFRA debacle. I'll keep watching!
What debacle?
Yep this is it
Works in my playbook
I want to opt out of the individual mandate tax too!!!
Beautifully covered...because, Jesus.

Yes! It doesn't any better than having multiple options.
This VP CLOWN ALSO KNEW ABOUT COLLUSION. History will show all these Republicans chose party over country! RPBLCNS DON'T KNOW HOW TO GOVERN
Pence is the leaker. Him and Ryan are out to hurt Trump and his family!
