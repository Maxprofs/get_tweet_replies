Appeals court upholds Obama-backed net neutrality rules http://politi.co/28C8Qav  | Getty 
5 unelected nominees should not be working against largest group of @Gop voters in history, but U are, guess there is no justice
@goober65  Thanks for fighting the Shovel Ready #DelegatesVoteCruz
ure!  My pleasure!
@politico  yet at SCTUS this can still happen. Prayers for USA, prayers for the Lone Star State.
Your donor must be so mad, you always lose your battles, it's almost like you're wrong all the time, eh?
MORE EVIDENCE is OBAMA being a TRAITOR!
@DrSueDVM @politico 
Yet, like the people in Orlando getting picked off one by one... We let five unelected bureaucrats snipe us
but a few Wealthy Companies should? Go back to Canada! #GovtShutDownClown
As a constituent in Texas I support you on everything BUT NOT your push against net neutrality @SenTedCruz
Internet speed is the only thing I agree with when it comes to Obama!!
@politico Delete your account ..
Who should? #internet
I don't get to elect the Texas senator who writes laws that affect me either!
All were approved by, the Foreign Student named Barry Soetoro, who went to #Pakistan , to marry his boyfriend. @realDonaldTrump
It's what the American People WANT, you tool.
@politico I'm watching and I vote.
umm do you have any of your Green Eggs and Ham #Filibuster merchandise left? REAL Senators are talking common sense #GunControl
@politico #doyourjob
@politico if you do not like it, pass a law to prohibit their actions.
Funny- I think most Americans like Net Neutrality. Big business should not dictate the freedom of information to Americans.
The FCC is right on this one @SenTedCruz - you're working toward marginalizing and shutting out churches and conservative site owners
CAN YOU PLEASE WALK OVER 2 THE HOUSE & TELL THAT FILIBUSTER EMPLOYEE HE IS GOOFING OFF ON MY DAM TIME CLOCK! #KEEPINGGUNS
@politico If you'd return that AT&T bribe money people would take your comments on net neutrality a little more seriously.
Please have the courage to stand with SenateDems to close the terrorist loophole. TERRORISTS should not be able to buy guns.
Conspicuously absent from   #gunviolence #filibuster.
I expect no better from you.
#ShameRequiresConscience
#NRAwhore
@politico
I miss your #Filibuster! :) YOUR THE EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR! THANK YOU!
GCI is raping us in Alaska with their blocking speeds. We should have unlimited data and full speed!!!!  Monopoly!!!!!
Good job using keywords when your argument lacks substance.Dictate & Unelected, that'll really get the crowd worked up.
@FrenchForTrump there is a lot of O Garbage that is going to get UN done!
@politico But your ISP should be able to dictate the content you receive, right? You are a shill for corps that screw Americans.
Yeah, I want Verizon to have more power.They monopolize my rural county with ridiculous pricing and usage limits.
@Rockprincess818 @politico another pending Obama disaster..stop him w pen & phone.TRUMP for USA..stop anti American policys
@Ricky_Vaughn99 Time to dissolve this committee and LRB with Trump victory.
@Rockprincess818 Look who assigned these people.  One clue... BARY
@politico Do  the internet from Comcast belong on IP address 172.20.20.20  all other internet are on 192.168.x.x in my area
@politico Well, we sure can't let the Internet providers dictate to us.
UN-elected Military Generals should not be dictating how Wars are Fought; when so many of our Grand Children's lives at stake!
Nor should Crony Politicians be so eager to extend favors to Corporate Oligarchs . . . who will carve it up & stick Consumers!

What will it take to get Congress to pass meaningful gun reforms to #EndGunViolence?
actions speak louder than words do something damn it
@politico 
Continue to make all the noise you can. Get voters to stop and think. Keep up the good work.
:  Roger that Senator!
@politico actually they should. If it were left up to service providers, we'd have small plans with data caps like mobile does
@jdarsey51 @politico 

Terrorist's use our technology to kill us, but we are too stupid to control it in our favor. Islam=Death
@politico world globalist plan
Unsurprisingly, even on this fairly non-partisan issue, this asshole is still on the wrong side. #NetNeutrality
@politico Congress has done this to themselves by delegating power to the Executive branch in the first place
@politico THIS IS BULLSHIT
Hey look at that. You lost. Again.
why don't you  be a true Republican and support @realDonaldTrump it's time we win this election with all of us United !
Do something about it. You gained a majority and haven't done a thing. Except put RINOs in the speakers seat. Try harder.
@politico are those on the left biologically opposed to freedom of any sort?
@politico not having been elected is a plus in my eyes. You momos don't know what you are talking about 90% of the time.
(is he referring to judges?)
@politico No thanks to you, this is a win for the people, not Corporate America.
@politico No one in DC has any right to tell me anything. What a cesspool DC has become, every last one of them is out of touch
@politico give them some more of that Cruz knowledge! This is the main reason I will be writing @tedcruz in as my president!
that's great, now get off your ass and endorse trump. youre my sen, but you'll get ryaned if u think u can run after Hillary.
@politico very true. What are you going to do about it?!
@DepressedWhitey @politico yet the US is quite happy for the unelected EU bureaucracy to have control over the UK?
Maybe the government is, I certainly am not and I believe Senator Cruz does not like big government.
Right so three Internet providers should? @SenTedCruz @politico
...Please find something more constructive to do with *OUR* time. (2/2)
I doubt the party of sour grapes would be whining quite so much if the decision had gone the other way... (1/2)
no they should not,that I do believe
@katestratton3 Why? U Guys Dictate All The Other Bull $H!T Ruining Our Lives N Pursuit Of Happiness! When Did U Get Back 2 Work?
@politico control information and you control people
@politico Thank you for all you do
Yes they should. Because they help keep money-grubbing idiots' hands off the people's Internet.  Bribed by your donors again eh?
But five un-elected judges should?
@politico we as Americans should never give up control of the internet as leaders of the free world.
@politico but I'm sure they know more than you
delete your account and fly out the window
@luckyone6565 I'm with you Ted. Angry at Federal Gov Overreach! @donjean13 @ChuckNellis
@PegAuger American czars....or something in 2009. #Unelected
Pass legislation.
@politico 

You're in the back pockets of Verizon and Time Warner
@politico That's right Senator!
NO ONE TRUSTS YOU
Wrong.
@coachbryer @politico now you see why the UK wants to leave the EU!
How much work has the republican party done in the past 8yrs???ZERO POINT ZERO! why don't you STFU TED and go away
I pray you can stop this madness.To millions of Americans it seems obama is trying to destroy as much as possible before leaving
But we all KNOW, @SpeakerRyan and Obama, will HAND our enemies full control AND MONEY.
Please don't let Obama "give away" the internet!
C'mon Ted, you should know by now THAT'S HOW THE GOVERNMENT WORKS.
So you want not all Internet to be equal? This seems  to be opposite then how you been seeing other laws/bills
like prototype HuffPo, all truth speak will then be "monitored out" by web surfing gov. employees?  I think.  per google China?
And four or five huge companies shouldn't have complete monopoly on broadband internet in this Country either, but they do.
You are right Ted. Clearly the corporations that own you should get to do that.
how can we miss you if you won't go away?
ISP's have no right to filter what we watch or offer different services for different usage. Thanks for coming out tho
.@SenTedCruz And THAT is how the State gains power.
@politico agreed senator
