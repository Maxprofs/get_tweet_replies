says man who lies, you are a traitor to America as well. You are for open borders and a lousy trade agreement. Lying Ted
wheres your evidence for such accusations toward a career defender of the constitution like Cruz?
.@OjedaShane @CharKyle13 .@SenTedCruz Right. Ted who defends terrorists 2A rights & wants to changes Constitution bits that don't suit him.
cite the source of information your basing that claim on.
.@OjedaShane @CharKyle13 @SenTedCruz on supporting terrorist 2A rights Cruz refuses to support and form of "no fly no buy".
that's because anyone can be put in that list without notice. Even you. It's ineffective.
.@OjedaShane @CharKyle13 @SenTedCruz Agreed there are serious deficiencies in the process.  Ok Fix it rather than bashing admin. Nice chat.
I'm here to inform and @SenTedCruz certainly wasn't "bashing" anyone so...
.@SenTedCruz Saying the magic incantation "Radical Islamic Terrorism" while bowing towards Texas defeats ISIS in the #CruzAlternateReality.
seems like your mind's made up. @SenTedCruz is for the people and the constitution, has been his whole career.
.@OjedaShane @SenTedCruz Suit yourself. Have a good evening.
you as well sir
do something useful in the Senate. All you do is tweet.
he just got out of a subcommittee meeting that he organized himself. You do something besides being out of the loop.
you're right, all he does is go to meetings. There's no legislation with Cruz's name on it as author. Name one.
heres 568 pages of legislation sponsored by @SenTedCruz. Take your pick...   https://www.congress.gov/member/ted-cruz/C001098 â€¦
that will never happen under the Muslim sympathizers Obama and lynch
hence the hearing.make an effort to understand the problem and fight back
when you have a president who doesn't acknowledge the problem and sympathizes with the enemy, then we have a problem
were in agreement
What, precisely, do you think we're doing with the $500M DOD budget? Inserting it into our gonads in a in a stimulating way?
out with Republican. No fly no gun
@AndrewCMcCarthy AND tutoring America on Hx seeds of MB Success in school/news/Court Rooms/Dod/DOJ fm "Future Jihad" pg 137-150
@Hardline_Stance '''''Liberal Dems use Radical Islam terror to promote taking American's guns!
you couldn't even defeat radical trumpism. at least we still have @JohnCornyn and that's not saying much
ok smarty pants: how do U stop incidents like Istanbul? lone wolves are hard to stop-keep those damn guns out of hnds--
OBAMA IS A DISGRACE
why cant we just fight terrorism and not label it?  Youre trying to make the good of that religion look worse for your agenda.
Amen Senator!

really?  You think that is the most important thing?
@jstines3 #startsnichin is the resource. THIS IS THE NEW MOVEMENT !!!!! #STARTSNITCHING
okay if someone says it and it doesn't go away will you off yourself from all social media and resign from politics forever?
if your object to hearing, you're hurting your cause by being so grotesque.
make sense then we can talk.
Sorry. I was saying if you object to the hearing @SenTedCruz held, you're hurting your cause by being so crass
Allah doesn't make boys she-asses in the mosque and temple, so who's corrupted ?
Yazidi Forced Whoredom ! girls are not sluts on their own, who are the seducing devils of cruelty and position:
You are right,but Obama won't acknowledge radical islamics because he thinks that we are the enemy and Islam is the solution.
@c5hardtop1999 if a Person (I.e., mosque Imams) knew or should have known terrorist activity knowingly failed 2 report = felony
@RestoreHistory Ban MB.
You must first admit that American government sponsored terrorism exists.
@TexanCat We also cannot combat politics as usual from you AND the GOPe who do NOTHING but talk and pass Obama agenda. Trump2016
We cannot help dying Veterans without bypassing a corrupt VA hospital system and authorize Healthcare Vouchers TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz
I acknowledge that it exists. I've been fighting it for the last 8 years. If only the president would untie our hands.
@4nconsulting Obama will never do it.  Leaving this mess for the next person while he works on his legacy agenda.
You've never heard of covert operations, you nitwit?
Bingo and love alone won't do it. Education is the ultimate way out. It will take generations so we need "them" to start now
...good idea..go join Canadian Mounties
didn't you die and go away? Must have been just a good dream I had.
that's because Barack Hussein Obama is the first radical Islamic president
support the people's nominee DT or #NeverRubioCruzRyan
I believe that point is not only accurate, but now widely accepted even by the Numb Nuts Democrats and Liberals
Obama administration intelligence is artificial!
We can replace "radical Islamic" with "political" and call it what it is but Christian crusader Cruz will have none of it.
As you predicted Trump is tanking. How sad we had a chance to have a clear choice, instead we got the Cheeto and the liar
You're out of your mind.  Is this still about semantics?
#nukethemiddleeadt
Why don't you keep your word and support our candidate?
We cannot combat & defeat mass murder and gun violence w/o acknowledging it exists & directing resources to stopping it.
6,627 gun deaths in the U.S. in 2016. 28 dead in Turkey. Why aren't you addressing the real threat to Americans?
13,676 gun related injuries in the U.S. in 2016. 60 injuries in Turkey. Why aren't you addressing the real threat to Americans?
Still singing that same old song,Everyone knows it exists dumbshit, what people call it doesn't matter.
U-party&TRUMP THE ASS&CROOKgive the losers ammo everytime u standup there talkin this shit Stop Givin Em All This POWER 4nothin
Thanks for the excellent job you did today presiding at the hearing! Listened to the whole thing.  Bravo!
then GTFO of the way of @realDonaldTrump by telling your crazy crew to support the nominee and support him yourself. Be a man.
Y dont u all stop adding2the bullshit radical Islam terrorism all u do is give those who recruit power of shit they arent STOP
.@SenTedCruz That right Teddy. You must turn towards Texas and say the magic incantation " Radical Islamic Terrorism" 3 times. #CruzBS
I thought Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser was inspirational and help in dealing with an issue of this magnitude
Great!
Pastor Ted Cruz Church and states that R separate please leave in shame TY state the lord of the Wind Texas God blessed Texas
ok then, pray for Turkish victims
Fantastic hearing today!
I watched your subcommittee hearing. I thought McCarthy's safe space reference was hilarious. #Ted
#MuhammadsWar #1400Years #SeeHadith
It's a feckless white donkey like yourself behind the refugee crisis. @SenTedCruz
you're extremely misguided if guided at all. Read more.
Good close at hearing. Common sense policing not p.c. limitations. Do you have the Un American list from the left?
How many troops are you willing to send?
for now it's more of a matter of recognizing the problem at the moment
saying two words won't change anything.
hopefully you realize more will be done than just that. Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser has an excellent position on the topic.
well tell that 2 Mr. Obama the expert!!!
you think?
Political Correctness forbids calling things what they are.
and how is that going to happen? Lone wolf terrorists how you going to stop them
That's exactly what ISIS wants. Credence... 
Then recruiting American muslims would be easier if we outcast our own.
Problem is that you are a unique voice in Senate. We need more people like you to do something about it.  God bless you.
@SenTedCruz
Are you still blabbing away even though you were beat by an insulting mocker? :) Why don't YOU go to the Front & fight yourself?
Can't defeat it with gun control and gun bans either. #2a
No shit Ted.  Tell us something we need to hear.  You gonna support Trump or just wait for another 4 years to fail.
Keep up the fight site,  OKLAHOMS with you!
thank you Senator for representing all conservatives throughout the nation.
Ted, I agree with U.
. You're in Congress.  Do something about it
He held a special hearing today. Watch CSpan lately?
. Nope
you mean we can't love them away???
go get em Ted! We can always count on you!
exactly
tell that to Barry.
THAT'S RIGHT!  aka, Frank Marshall Jr
