@SenTedCruz you just love wasting taxpayer dollars, don't you?
@AaronBrynen @SenTedCruz How would you like to be targeted by the IRS, Puddin?
@HarrietBaldwin I'm not a political group applying for tax-exempt status. Puddin.
@AaronBrynen What if the IRS came after you for an Obamacare violation, Puddin?
@HarrietBaldwin I'm not violating any ACA requirements, so....
@AaronBrynen How can you be sure?
@HarrietBaldwin would you mind getting to your point already, Puddin? Threatening me with the IRS isn't worrisome.
@AaronBrynen I'm not threatening you with the IRS. Your government is. So Ted Cruz is correct to protect the records. THAT'S the point.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept What is the batting average on these republican investigations?
@CopyDan @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept When Ted Cruz becomes President all will see an HONEST person in the White House.
@BobPhillips17 @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Why? Is he bringing a friend?
@CopyDan @BobPhillips17 @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept one would be a first
@BobPhil02231481 @BobPhillips17 @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept James K Polk was a liar??
@CopyDan @BobPhillips17 @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept so what does make Cruz a liar????
@BobPhil02231481 @BobPhillips17 @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept I'm guessing mostly his mouth? http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/statements/ â€¦

@SenTedCruz @lyz_estrada @TheJusticeDept I can tell you that is one request that will definitely be ignored
@SenTedCruz @heylaurafreed @TheJusticeDept it's not like anyone Going to jail for this. Business as usual
@bad_jujuu @SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept True that- however, as "community police" Obama is pushing we could make our own arrests.
@SenTedCruz @vmpcott @TheJusticeDept  Yeah, good luck with that. They're headed to th incinerator now.
@SenTedCruz @Tab1791 @TheJusticeDept @Marklevinshow asked this of the EPA, A Judge agreed The EPA deleted all records anyway.
@SenTedCruz will the IRS save the documents or will they disappear like Hillary's emails?
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Cruz says to Rich/ Corporations I am trying 2 make it so we do not have 2 pay our taxes
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept 
Thank you.
A reminder to them that destruction of evidence is admission of guilt might be in order.
@SenTedCruz How about requesting SS to give us a increase for 2016!
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @TheJusticeDept Good call Ted. Obama and his disgrace of a Justice Dept. let them spit in the face of every American.
@SenTedCruz @jko417 @TheJusticeDept ...You can bet the shredders are on FULL SPEED at THIS MOMENT!!!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept @truckerbooman Gotta stop Obozo's pen from the "climate change" B.S.....
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept WILL THEY LISTEN? THEY ALL DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept the entire Executive Branch has proven they will destroy docs.  Good move by Cruz!

@SenTedCruz Senator, what are we doing about the DOD's $43M gas station? 1SG (RET, RA) Phillip Cornell
@SenTedCruz  I hope the server doesn't crash on election night
@SenTedCruz @freedomtex @TheJusticeDept The document tying the WH to the IRS targeting of conservative groups is still waiting to be found.
@ajbrzski @SenTedCruz I don't think IRS needed a document. The vitriolic hateful statements regularly made by Dem leadership was plenty.
@SenTedCruz @freedomtex @TheJusticeDept and they said.. Great another POLITICIAN putting on a show# Termlimits
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept great. Unfortunately you will be stonewalled.
@SenTedCruz Thank you Senator Cruz for defending our freedom.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Good idea!
@sentedcruz @thejusticedept Good Luck Ted! Obama's justice Dept is the most corrupt in history!
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin Haha! All talk and no action
@SenTedCruz I believe they will be destroyed before that investigation. That's how the Obama DOJ operates
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept Ted Cruz is fighting for us!
@SenTedCruz plz let voters hear you! Support the #BlazeDebate
@SenTedCruz please help us Mr. Cruz
@SenTedCruz Pres Obama's Justice Dept would not objectively investigate Obama's IRS; why didn't congress appoint independent investigator?
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept preserve and protect
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Thanks for looking out for us.
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept You don't actually expect them to do that?
Thank you @SenTedCruz . @thejusticedept 
#LoisLerner #Teaparty #TrueTheVote
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept Do you think Bama regime justice dept. will preserve docs. knowing.they have done in the past?
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept ALL records, everything should be held.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept thank you Senator Cruz.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Fight the Good Fight Mr Cruz. I have made up my mind- you have my Vote and will fight with you

@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept Good. Luck getting that done
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept great! More wasted money and time! Go for the real issues!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept @michellemalkin it won't be the Clinton Admin: no justice there.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Right, don't come forward with evidence of scandal, just imply that one could exist and your the man to fix it.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept requesting something on behave of a future admin. Kind of like being guilty of a future law. Unconstitutional.
@SenTedCruz @michellemalkin @TheJusticeDept Let us know how that works out for you.  The DoJ is just the enforcement arm of the ExecBranch.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Didn't Congress investigate this several times already? How'd that turn out?
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Now THAT sounds like a plan! Thank you!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept But will they?
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept They need to release them and do the investigation NOW.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Presumptuousness is not a good thing, but keep it up; you help the Democrats out with every comment U make.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept  I'm sure the shredders have been working overtime. #ThanksTed
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept good luck with that
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Ok Thanks.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept  #canitbedone
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept So will accept Rubo's offer to be VP so the 2 of you can lose together?
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept The next administration which you won't be a part of. It's already over dude. Demographics, you don't have them.
@SenTedCruz @PolitiBunny #Cruz2016 #GreatAmericanAwkening
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Don't worry they will be in the same filing cabinet as Barry's college records
@SenTedCruz Time to move on Ted. If nominated, I plan to vote for you and expect you to work on current problems, at home and abroad  #job1
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept @PolitiBunny 
I bet they jump right on that.
@SenTedCruz Good luck with that.
good move @SenTedCruz at least they cant say you didn't ask for them @TheJusticeDept aka department of injustice, under Obama adm
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept I'm notgoing to hold my breath on that one.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Do not forget Fast & Furious. People died on both sides of border.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept and This justice dept can be trusted?  Don't think so
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Great Move.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Hope you get chance to use them.
@SenTedCruz Good luck with that
@tomh2739 @SenTedCruz well like this if they get rid of it they were warned....
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept
