FINALLY!!! It's about time!! This should have been done years ago! America stands UNITED with Israel!!!
Trump’s team to PA: ‘There is no Palestine, Jerusalem is not your capital’ https://worldisraelnews.com/trumps-team-to-pa-there-is-no-palestine-jerusalem-is-not-your-capital/?utm_source=pushengage&utm_medium=push_notification&utm_campaign=pushengage … FUBO!
@SenTedCruz Lets get it done. No more TALK. Jerusalem the land of Christ-Ian's
Nope
Another disbeliever Mr Hell. Witness and weep BCZ it is HAPPENING. Onwards to JERUSALEM
I doubt you've ever been to Jerusalem.
Where I'm from,where I've been, witnessed & suffered would turn you inside out. Jerusalem it WILL HAPPEN
Do these dip sticks want a world war?Why do you think it hasn't been done by now.GOD SAVE US FROM ignorant populists
Just trying to make amends for the Obama fail with the UN. @FoxNews @brookefoxnews
Love it! Reverse everything B Hussein Obama has done!
like what?
Classy.  He didn't answer my question and neither did you.  #maga my ass
Shock!  No convincing you Libby
can't answer a basic question
a political masterstroke let's see if Chuck Schumer votes NO or chickens-out and "misses" voting or abstains
@SenTedCruz @brookefoxnews @donsurber Every anti-Israel UN vote should be followed up on with pro-Israel laws from Congress.
Smashing idea, Charles! @FoxNews @SenTedCruz @brookefoxnews @donsurber
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the American Embassy should be in Jerusalem.
Bad move!  You will be putting more of a target on US lives (but that's probably what ya'll want).
Then I guess we should give the entire US back to the Native Americans if we're going by that.
So I guess we should take Japan and Germany. And no thanks, I wouldn't suck on anything you offered up
Typical. I'm educated on 6Day War. Not as simple as "to victor go the spoils" + much more history.
@TRUMP_PREZ @brookefoxnews
DidWe FIND THAT 6BILLION DOLLARS YET YOU KNOW THE $6BILLION HILLILIAR LOST CAUSE THEY CANT FIND IT SERIOUSLY CANTFND

this sends an unambiguous message to the Arab world recognizing Israel right to existence
OOPs..! there goes any hopes of Palestinian nation and PEACE....
These senators enjoy peace and tranquility in America and it shows how out of touch they are with reality
@SenTedCruz @brookefoxnews Thanks Ted! This is awesome!
Given the the harm done to Israel by Obama/Kerry, it's an important act that will restore Israel confidence in US.
To God be the glory.
Then let the @SenateGOP go and physically help in moving it.
Yes!! 
Why is this a priority? Don't you know that the deplorables generally deplore giving money to and defending Israel?
good choice.
Put it right in Jerusalem this month.
Should move Israel to Hollywood!
as it should be.
That is an excellent idea, to make this move
I prayed they would do this!!!
@os4185 @brookefoxnews Yes
now that's more like IT.ISREAL our FRIEND.USAPROISREAL TRUMP will protect &defend ISREAL against ALL ENEMIES
Congressional Res. on J'lem Non-Binding would violate International Law
.@FoxNews @brookefoxnews Israel should be able to have their capital anywhere they decide! Jerusalem is the perfect place!
OUTSTANDING! SCREW BHO and the #UN
Ya.. We love Israel..
Waste of money

Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!
that should bring peace really fast.Sheeps
This is a direct "in your face" to Obama when he threw Israel under the bus at the UN
: about time
love it, it was about time
That's insane.  Terrible sense of priorities. 
Lackeys to Israel.
it's their land anyway
@netanyahu @IsraeliPM
GOP Senators introduce bill to move US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  http://fxn.ws/2j6j95c  via @brookefoxnews 
right on! In your face anti Semitic lib tards
Why was it not put in Jerusalem in the first place?
http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/guantanamo-bay-donald-trump-congress/index.html … DT's tweet notwithstanding since Obama is POTUS
more bullshit huh?
And the war will come . And for the @gop=criminals . Only for business.@CNNEE
Please reply: how many countries have their embassy in Jerusalem?
YUP AND GUESS WHO WAS THE FIRST TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN CONGRESS? THAS RIGHT, CRUZ. @FoxNews @brookefoxnews
It's about time. Thank you congress
maybe they should spend some time fixing Americas problems #isolationism
Hope it passes. We need to send Israel a serious signal that America stands  with them. This is such a signal.
go for it been Jewish cap for 3500 years
and put the new in UN tent in the Gaza strip
http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/donald-trump-joey-cinque-mob-new-years/index.html … then there's the murderer, King
that's a really good idea, Finally.
Bush & Obama prepared the ground. Trump may fulfil Bibi's dream. Now the battle will shift to Rights vs Apartheid.
Hopefully in the old eastern Jewish Quarter, too
FANTASTIC IDEA -------- one put forth by Newt Gingrich !!!
I hope they do
Here, here!
Let's just stir the pot in the name of Jesus, shall we? #EndlessConflict
afraid it will be a slap in the face to the Arab world not good for other embassies in Arab regions
Great idea just do it already do it by executive order
Good Move!!
WHAT A BUNCH OF IGNORANT DUMMIES !
great to see jelly gone. When she came on I tuned fox out!
why don't they move congress2 Jerusalem as well. Pple in USA are suffering & u are introducing bills 2better another country. WOW
@SenTedCruz @brookefoxnews

Primarily should look as to why it hasn't been done since the bill was passed in 1995.
@SenTedCruz @brookefoxnews #StandWithIsrael
If you're gonna set fire to the house, might as well burn 'er to the ground
WHY DID STATE DEPT FIND THAT 6BILLION HILLILIAR LOST 4 OR 5 YS AGO HMM!!??!
. I was hoping they would wait until 1/21 before pushing my kids closer to a draft....they can't wait.
Provoking more war in the Middle East serves the real master of most Republican moves there: Money.
Interesting, but will be more interested to see who votes for/against.
@SenTedCruz @brookefoxnews that law already exists. Passed in 94ish.
Who cares?
Why is this neccessary? Won't it be expensive to do that? Is the U.S. officially siding with Jerusalem?
Recognize Taiwan also!!! Those guys can fight have you ever seen their Parliament? Lol
approved
start ordering sand bags @CNN
for what reason? Your Christian hitler views? Or what
.
All of this winning...and nowwww...Common Sense!
.
@SenateMajLdr Just because Israel is always a dick doesn't mean you have to be.
Bible prophecies happening everywhere
Yes. Except they have been for 2000 years.
It is sad to sea many animals dying upon shore in the thousands. The polar ice caps melting and nukes.
lol see•
Great way to save money. Idiots.
You are so right. Typical pols who have no concern abt spending tax payers $ without their consent.
This is an awesome message to send to the UN and the world!  Great idea!
YES!!!!
excellent!!
Amen! Let the real change happen...thank U Lord!!
