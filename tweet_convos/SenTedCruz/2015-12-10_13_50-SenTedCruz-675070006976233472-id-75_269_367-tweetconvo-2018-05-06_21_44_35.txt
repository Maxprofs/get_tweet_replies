@SenTedCruz You're good at mouthing platitudes and invoking Reagan; when it comes to actually doing the *work*, you're out fundraising.
@dougom I've done rock-hard work, including mouthing, to keep America's future generations safe.
@SenTedCruz I thank God every day for Senator Ted Cruz. I wish you were my senator. But I know you'll be my President.
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad we know what u said about Trump @ your fund-raising event. Too bad u chose to do that. Can't trust u anymore TRUMP2016

@SenTedCruz I like you a lot. But don't attack Trump it will be the kiss of death. You are in a good position stay the course.
@SenTedCruz You mean protect rich people's freedom (and their money). Greedy Obstructionist Pirates only care for themselves.
@SenTedCruz @newsgirl123456  Ted would that be  ALL USAMERICANS   or the ones #DonaldTrump deems USA citizens? #GOPSILENCE
@SenTedCruz Yes.  #MadrasahMan ignores #Constitution to "change" America in a few generations to follow Sharia.
@SenTedCruz I AGREE
@SenTedCruz freedom from government medical tyranny.
@SenTedCruz   We are giving up our sovereignty!!!!!
@SenTedCruz unless you are a Muslim. That's the GOP policy
@SenTedCruz well Ted, ask Donald Trump how to do this. Everything he has said is being asked for by security and homeland security.
@SenTedCruz good job Mr politician you know how to be vague!
@SenTedCruz will you protect the freedoms of non-christians, non-whites, & areligious secular citizens? #imaginenoreligion
@SenTedCruz like any family, you protect your own children first.
@KimHawk18755218 @SenTedCruz That's right, my own children always come first.
@SenTedCruz There is a core that does have firm resolve. Then from the top down it's wishy washy in some circles.
@SenTedCruz  Except of course parts of  the 1st and 14th Amendments.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @DavidJMadeira We got our man, it's Donald J. Trump, our next President. Now get back to work and help our Vets
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump isn't afraid of protecting Americans, like Jimmy Carter in 1972.
@SenTedCruz maybe a COG law based off the militia act of 1791.
.@SenTedCruz 《》Next stop, the White House!!!

@SenTedCruz And this is the reason that  we can't be allowing Refugees that aren't vetted properly because they lie on the apps& enter U.S,
@SenTedCruz Amen! #ReingnitingThePromise #CruzCrew @tedcruz45
@SenTedCruz I think we can confidently check that box.
@SenTedCruz That's what @realDonaldTrump is trying to do! Our Gov needs to follow this law!
@SenTedCruz what does that even mean Ted?  You're so transparent it's embarrassing. Oh, and why do you hate Mexicans so much Ted?
@SenTedCruz why is that so hard to expect?  BO is twisting message that we will harbor ill will to muslim americans not case
@SenTedCruz Which to do that requires a ban on all muslims coming into this country until Washington gets their act together.
@SenTedCruz Because everyone knows that a firm resolve always stops bullets.
@SenTedCruz  An utterly meaningless statement from an utterly meaningless individual.
@SenTedCruz We have that just you people not doing you damn jobs.
@SenTedCruz ooh, I can't wait to hear the second thing America needs. #TedCruzIsOnFire
@SenTedCruz Dont take our guns.
@SenTedCruz Republicans who support Trump are putting our Homeland in grave danger

@SenTedCruz #NYC acts like a city that didn't have 3,000 funerals after 9/11; when will we learn. #IllegalApartments #HomelandSecurity #NYS
AMEN @SenTedCruz #ProtectAmericans and #OurFreedoms here at home
@SenTedCruz So, is there any value to discussing the cost of the refugees who likely don't speak English and won't find good jobs?
@SenTedCruz USA at crossroads. Do we want to make the mistake Europe made? No immigration fromf shariah countries
@SenTedCruz Which is why electing you even dog catcher would be a disaster.
@SenTedCruz Senator, what America needs today is fewer hard-liners on both sides of the aisle. Hard-liners is all I see in this campaign.
@SenTedCruz if not already justice Robert hoop jumping was odd. How easy to put child porn on your computer and a tip comes in
@SenTedCruz why don't #NYC lawmakers take the issue of #IllegalAprtments as a #HomelandSecurity issue? Make it a Federal Crime. #Landlords
@SenTedCruz LOOK FOLKS ITS CAPTAIN TEDDY
@PhillipCMcGuire @SenTedCruz Database for refugees cut social benefits
@sentedcruz  Absolutely!  Providing for the common defense includes being damn careful about who you let into the US.
…Keeping America SAFE is a Constitutional Priority #1Requirement @SenTedCruz
