@tedcruz @CR That's my Ted,Texas tough!ACLU is a crazy bunch of liberals that sit around thinking of ways to destroyChristians
Cruz gonna be OK nxt year?
@tedcruz @CR 

Great job senator cruz!!
@LuvGodFamUSA @CR Note to Mr. Cole: best not to tangle with Cruz on high level legal matters. Down 4 the count
Ted's the best!
@tedcruz I see people praising you but you couldn't get your point across when running for the highest office. GOH
@jstines3 @CR 
Who's better the Ted Cruz 
@tedcruz 
Ted Cruz you are a pathological liar and probably did not go to kindergarten

God for you.
@tedcruz ACLU is just another useless group. They are just bullies
Ted is awesome, he caught evil, partisan deception in a very public way.
@tedcruz he set fire to that ass hahahahaha #Wow
the @ACLU is a sad, pathetic organization. anti-Christian, disgusting "values", zero understanding of the Constitution, etc...
@SenTedCruz @CR Just more Alternative Facts, folks!
@tedcruz keep kicking their butts!
@GaetaSusan . Now this is is the Cruz I know. We need him . True conservative Christian.
C'mon DT glaring constant lack of credibility/ integrity blame game pitiful.Trashing,IntelConstitution,US DIVEST
@tedcruz @CR Can you defend #JeffSessions position on property seizure without trial? http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/26/trumps-proposed-attorney-general-thinks-seizing-your-property-without-trial-is-a-solid-idea/ … via @theblaze
@tedcruz so awesome!
@tedcruz @CR #TedCruz-your awesome!!
@tedcruz @CR A must watch. Thank You Senator Cruz.
War monger
@bcwilliams92  Go Ted!
the ACLU lie. No way.
@tedcruz @CR A bit long video, but worth couple minutes of your time #greatpicks #PresidentTrumpCabinet @SenatorSessions
The Cruz Master is going martial arts on these hearings
@tedcruz @CR ##con madre!!! Viva Cruz!!! Viva el viejito Sessions!!!
@tedcruz @CR Sessions doesn't understand balance of powers. JS: Roe v Wade is the law of the land. Bows to judicial supremacy.
@tedcruz @CR Senator Cruz, thank you for setting the record straight during Jeff Sessions confirmation. Al Frankin's a clown.
@tedcruz @CR Ted is a serious rock star 
@SenTedCruz @CR 
@ChuckNellis Ats my Boy !
Senator you have regained my respect back by your outstanding performance at the hearing yesterday!
Anyone that thinks they are a match for Ted Cruz is sadly mistaken
@tedcruz  You don't know a thing about #Jeff Sessions. Look up the facts, lady, not the vitriol.
@tedcruz @CR but of course, it's cocnservatives trying to paint the left as 'painters' as you just did.  Heil Trump!
@tedcruz Mr Cole defended himself admirably.
@tedcruz @CR they don't have to paint him as a racist, just expose the truth.
@tedcruz @CR Looked more like railroading to me. when you ask a question, you should shut your mouth and listen to the answer
how do you put someone on Blast?
#AnswerYourPhone so you can hear how Texans really feel about Sessions!  You are ignoring the people in your state!
@SenTedCruz @CR Ever think that maybe Sessions just isn't a good person and shouldn't hold an office to uphold morals? #KKK
@tedcruz @CR Hopefully th pres-Elect will nominate Cruz to the Supreme Court.Brilliant mind that believes in the constitution.
@tedcruz @CR Way to go Ted
@tedcruz @CR Ted Cruz, telling it like it is!
@SenTedCruz @CR Hang in there w/the facts Sen. Cruz. The ideologues can't deal with facts/truth.
@SenTedCruz @CR 

Cruz would have made a gr8 President. I'm so sorry he lost. #IncredibleTedCruz
Well done; you have redeemed yourself.
Dayum! I would NOT want to get in an argument with you @tedcruz ! I'd end up having to resort to name-calling and screaming bad words..
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz wouldn't recognize a FACT if it kissed him on his lips.
Senator.It is occurring to me more each day that you are an integral part of saving this country.Please don't stop
@tedcruz @CR thats why Cruz should be the president elect
@SenTedCruz Go TED Go!  So proud to have you as my senator! @ACLU you have lost any chance of credibility as a real CL group.
@tedcruz @CR then man knows his stuff highly intelligent where r the Libs answering facts instead of fake news
Excellent video. Go Sen. Cruz !!
@SenTedCruz @CR Jeff Sessions has more integrity than 90 percent of the democrats, that includes Cory Booker.
@tedcruz @CR I listened! The ACLU IS BIASED AGAINST SESSIONS! Literally making a false claim! Another rat democrat!
@tedcruz he is voting for him; don't trust him.
Ted Cruz is awesome!
@SenTedCruz @CR الله عليك يا عمر
@tedcruz @CR this article talked nothing about accusations made in the maj. white counties. Who made those claims?
Thanks  this USA we know
@tedcruz You always want facts when it's democrats but with republicans you don't care about truth nor facts. Hypocrites
Cruz' staffer is fascinating! Total proper decorum but his eye twinkles give away that he's enjoying this. As do I!
@tedcruz Very nice Ted Cruz!
@tedcruz @CR brilliant Ted Cruz you can fight for my any day.
Thoroughly enjoyable.
Senator - you are phenomenal.  I voted for you in the primaries and am so proud, honored and relieved to have you representing our state
Praying for his reelection and financially contributing from Illinois. I want to move to Texas!
@tedcruz @CR Why don't you just tweet "See: I hate black people as much as Trump, I promise!"
@tedcruz @CR Ted Cruz I'm glad you stayed in the Senate! Hopefully you'll be on the presidential ballot in 2020.
Ted with the mic drop at the end.

@tedcruz @CR proud of u Ted!
Senator, you're loving these hearings, aren't you?  Your professionalism shines in such settings.
@tedcruz @CR the left is always misleading and putting out fake information,  trying to ruin a GOOD man's reputation!
yeah, like pointing out his blatant lies about his record, forcing him to admit it. So rude.
blatant lies is correct.  Lies must be something you aren't comprehending
@tedcruz @CR Looks and sounds to me like Mr.Ted Cruz just #spanked Mr Cole 
@tedcruz @CR The ACLU is a Anti-Christian organization that needs to be shut down and sued for harassing #Christians .
@tedcruz @CR @tempteststorm2 well versed on the points at hand. Same boldness as Pres Elect Trump. Ur gaining my respect back?
by the way ted the #jewish
People were refugees after #egypt
Freed them thousands of years ago
R they the problem man
or r the muslims
To blame for everything #preacherman
U said #syrian refugees r not welcome here
Can u explain why 
Or Teddies version of the "facts" about Jeff B(igot) Sessions.
Remember what happened the last time @tedcruz put someone on blast?  Nothing
@tedcruz @CR The Cong. Black Caucus was an embarrassment. @repjohnlewis describing Alabama 50 yrs ago like Sessions did it.
@tedcruz @CR Too had nobody pays attention to Lyin'Ted. He's a total loser and sad man. #TrumpHo
@tedcruz @CR lol ok if you say so
