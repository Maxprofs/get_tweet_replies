@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes, & we will NEVER forget that he was MURDERED & some day soon his killer will be identified !! 
I HOPE he is the #prolife nominee that EVERY Constitutional Conservative is praying for... cuz THIS is ONLY reason I voted DT. 
So you're pro-life but voted for someone who passively encourages hate crimes, condemns refugees to death, --
you got it wrong girl
Got to keep the honest honest
Law breakers behind bars
Antonin "Nino" Scalia! 
What an incredible mind & credit to this beautiful country!! Amazing wit & dissents 4 lifetime study!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr oh my there is Gorsuch in regular clothes.He better splash some mud on them!!! Lol!!!
I AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT
@TDennis17 BTW, senator has the doubtfully presented cause of Scalia's death ever been officially challenged?
@CFRAZIER329 We the REAL people are behind you Judge Gorsuch! We NEED you!
nope
nope
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ted you should have been by the one... But it wasn't your turn... Get back in the fight that is were your needed
she has embraced her self a long time ago life time politician with no record of substance
@Freeyourmindkid
Y Wasn't an Autopsy Done on Justice Scalia?? A Very Questionable Sudden Death?? Wonder Who's Fingerprints were involved here???
@PeggyRuppe Wish you folks would stop wasting MY money with constant bloviating and would get to the matter at hand.
He did great
so, a narrow minded bigoted ass is your choice????
so much depends on this, you have to be it right
@DonaldJTrumpJr Already convinced by @realDonaldTrump that @SenTedCruz is Lyin' son of JFK assasin. Friend of you, Vlad & Judge Napolitano?
Do not confirm Gorsuch until the Trump Russia connection is resolved.Do not pass Trumpcare or repeal Obamacare. Mother of 6
It's going to take a generation to fix the mess they've made of our society & families. Hope you're in this for the long haul.
************ STOLEN SEAT *********** leave it open for the next 4 years. I've told my Senators, now I'm telling YOU !
@DonaldJTrumpJr  Ted, you should be next 
@DonaldJTrumpJr that's right thru Neil Gorsuch, Scalias legacy lives. We support you from PA!  #SCOTUS #MAGA 
when will we have Judge Garland's hearing?  #liarsandcheats
ALL appointments should be suspended. This person is dangerous just like 45.
you are such a kiss-as$. Have you no pride. Your wife is insulted publicly. #ShameOnYou @DonaldJTrumpJr
he is a racist rich elite just like you
Why? How about just finding someone that's going to be fair & follow our laws? Oh that's right, fair isn't in your vocabulary.
And we can never replace the trust the GOP has broken by colluding with Russia to steal the election.
I think since Trump is in the last year (maybe week) of his presidency we should wait until the next election.  #trumprussia
Go back to Cuba ,,,both of you
@SenateRPC #confirmgorsuch & #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
We the People do not want Scalia's legacy. You're rich.  Go buy a freaking clue.
You make the "R" in Republican say Russian #trumprussia #treason
Great picture on Colorado land Gorsuch shares with Colorado beer billionaire???
@ThereseOSulliv2 we, the Conservative Constitutionalists, would also like to see YOU as Justice in SCOTUS.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Scalia was amazing but we have to move on to acquire more amazing!  RIP Scalia,  welcome SCOTUS Gorsuch.
Yeah except it's not his seat to take nor your Orange Leader's to fill: It's Obama's. 100%
we should have heard Obama's pick but you don't care what the people want
obama was clintons crook
@senjudiciary 
Conservative Christians make for THE WORST types of Politicians and SCOTUS. 
Save Us Jesus, from ur followers.
Trump should not be allowed a hearing on Gorsuch. This is Trump's last year in office!!
I pray this judge is a blessing to the American people. 
You should recuse urself since you violated ur oath to the Constitution when u denied Garland a hearing. Shame thy name is Ted.
the point is they are #constitutionalist justices. That's the good thing.
SCALIA WAS A PIG
note the #trumptrain coming in the background. 
#LoseCruz2018
Do whatever it takes. 2 many cases right NOW that need a constitutional response-Change the rules then change them back if u mst
Go away Teddie.
yes we can replace him and you
And you are guilty of pushing judicial activism with this pick and denying Garland a hearing.

agreed.
Another mysterious death !
@DonaldJTrumpJr yes Absolutely he was a REAL JUDGE
@MickBlair54 
Hope Democrats respect him and approve him
Why do you want to continue a legacy of bigotry? I think the Dems should give the same consideration that was given Garland.
@DonaldJTrumpJr FINALLY!!
No we don't need Scalia's legacy to live on.. what kind of BS is this?!
@DonaldJTrumpJr CSPAN 
WATCH IT ALL THEY CAN SAY IS WHO LEAKED IT , I CAN SAY THIS WHO LEAKED EMAIL INFO ??
ITS ABOUT TIME.
@DonaldJTrumpJr No Fascist in The USA
@DonaldJTrumpJr let's get Judge Gorsuch on Supreme Court, a man proven to follow and protect our Constitution!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SenTedCruz liar liar pants on
let's get it done
Confirm
No society working towards a better future for all its members needs his "legacy" to live on in any way whatsoever..
keep pushing the right push *+*
STOLEN SEAT.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Fuck Scalia, Cruz and the whole Tump Klan 
#MerrickGarland
How many months did you spend refusing to grant Merrick Garland a hearing? You should be embarrassed.
Your president is still campaigning - clearly we can't hold hearings to confirm a Supreme Court Justice during a campaign.
@DonaldJTrumpJr good luck to the judge. We need him on the bench
the day democracy died was the day the @GOP decided to play politics with the SCOTUS and not give Merrick Garland  a hearing.
Confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to SCOTUS.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Merrick Garland
The Constitution allowed Obama to appoint a Supreme Court Justice you & your party stole that seat from Merrick Garland.
But his name isn't Merrick Garland.
Look at all that testosterone! Such men! Such control of their uteruses! Oh, wait...
I will be praying
Grant Merrill Garland a hearing and a vote!!  Oh, BTW, You will never be Potus.
It's Merrick.  And, not this time.
When you confirm him name the day "Harry Reid Day" in honor of the man who gave the gift that keeps on giving, nuclear option
let's get judge Gorsuch in place so President Trump can start protecting U.S. without these lib-tard judges stalling the process
Neal Gorsuch will be an illigitmate Supreme Court Justice.  That seat was stolen by you & the rest of the Republican party.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Losing Scalia was (still is) heartbreaking, #Gorsuch is absolutely the 'next best thing' #MAGA #ConstitutionWins
your dad killed Kennedy so that lives on
,,,yeah , continue the legacy of hate, bigotry, racism that YOU like Scalia embraced !
@DonaldJTrumpJr enjoying aspen?
let's all remember where he died? No conflict there ?
lying ted
3 mos into a new admin and the dems are whining about imagined election hacks.
will it end in my lifetime?
Like we would listen to a coward like u Ted Cruz. Your wife should have left u for betrayal. You chose Trump over your wife.
@DonaldJTrumpJr this is the single most important thing to accomplish to ensure our country is ruled by the constitution.period!
Wow. @SenTedCruz What a great pic!
Won't be watching! I'd rather go to the dentist for a Root Canal. 2006, a great guy! 2016, slum dog.
#GOPobstruction #TermLimits Merrick Garland.
Not this time.
Gorsuch seems like a fine justice, but still gunshy after seeing Bush appointed Roberts play legislator rewriting ACA
Hope all goes better than expected!
@DonaldJTrumpJr bullshit. Merrick garland sbe the man. Another illegitimate person in the trump swamp
We can never replace JFK  after you're dad KILLLED him !
.@SenTedCruz It doesn't really start until tomorrow, so that every Senator can get his or her pre-amble & opening statement into the record.
@DonaldJTrumpJr  Nope!
You and your cohort of corrupt cronies are beyond redemption. You've put party before country- RESIGN, SWAMP DWELLER!!!
Agreed. I am also from Queens, NY and am a Conservative. Was AS assassinated?
Why was there no autopsy for Judge Scalia?
Thank God! Who wants another Scalia?!
No thanks, we like civil liberty and freedom from religion. We'll pass on the illegitimate justice. #RESISTANCE
YOU are what's been wrong with America for many years now. We will MAGA!
#StolenSeat
I'm praying that there are wise decisions made today that reflect the will of the people over any party, this is important.
MERRICK GARLAND
