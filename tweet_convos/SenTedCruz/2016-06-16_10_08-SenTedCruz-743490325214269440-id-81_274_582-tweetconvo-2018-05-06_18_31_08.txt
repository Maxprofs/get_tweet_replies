Just shut up Ted- your credibility is par with Obama & Hillary  #EndorseTrump @SenTedCruz @LorenzoCastane3
You're off your rocker, @LyndaG1963! Call 911. @SenTedCruz
Where's his endorsement of our R nominee? Think he signed a pledge...yes? NO CREDIBILITY @LorenzoCastane3 @SenTedCruz
I was a Cruzer until IOWA  @thedude4242 @LorenzoCastane3 @SenTedCruz
I voted for McCain & Romney... I did AGAINST OBAMA...why these #NeverTrump dolts piss me off @thedude4242 @LorenzoCastane3 @SenTedCruz
@WendytheBee Listening to him is so calming. Stark contrast to the disgust I feel when I see/hear Dump. I sure miss @tedcruz
You mean THAT VOICE???  Wimpy Wimpy Wimpy!!  #TrumpONLY
Then stop allowing them access to firearms.
The EVIL Enemies will STILL get weapons, what do you not understand about that??!!
Let's just GIVE them weapons, then.
Obama & Hillary HAVE given them weapons, where have you been?
So did Reagan and the Bushes. I been around a while.
Am not talking about Reagan & Bush ..Talking about Hillary vs Trump.  Hillary same as obama only WORSE
And you're whining again.
@mitchlreynolds @SenTedCruz
So every other nutbag with a gun is fine? We just need to stop the Muslim ones?
Taking guns AWAY FROM American Citizens Will NOT STOP TERRORISM !  Bomb the Hell Out of Them!!! #2A #terrorism
So now we're going to bomb St. Lucie, FL?  That's where Mateen lived.
No. You bomb the ones that are spreading this radical DISEASE...where ever this man & his family came from.
@FoxNews We should freeze our borders from all non citizens, Obama is now fast tracking illegals here I guess so they can vote
CLOSE THE BORDER!!!
Some reason, "better late than never" doesn't even sound right when referring to Cruz. Gang of 8 is limit of his Foreign Policy
What about the #gunviolence every day on the streets of Chicago and other places?!
They don't care about Chicago
TRUMP WILL IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. BUT FIRST HE HAS TO GET BY PAUL RYAN AND THE ESTABLISHMENTS COVERT PLANS TO DUMP TRUMP
Why is your right to own a gun specifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible greater than my right to live?
@Ruach321  It's CALLED the 2nd Amendment. Remember, gun don't kill people...people kill ...Did you forget??
Reading Green Eggs and Ham again? I love that one! #DisarmHate #Enough
We@must protect the American people from YOU! #DisarmHate #Enough
Right on!  Damn politicians are the problem...most ALL of them need REPLACED!
@LorenzoCastane3 why oh why did you stop? Please tell me you've got something planned for the convention?  #NeverHillary
we should also put protecting ourselves from radical judges and senators on that list present company excluded......
@WAGNERGIRLE you, sir, must protect us, as president
And lone wolf crazies & hate groups!
I have faith in you.
@DeborahLovesUSA I'm getting the picture we need to protect Americans from Democrats?
I think you seriously need to concentrate on Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood.
STOP HIM NOW........
Honey, laws don't protect.  FORCE does.  Molon Labe.
why dont u and your NRA buddies take your guns over there and fight the terrorists. Action speaks louder than BS
Nukes ?
ask for formal declaration of war on ISIL
OK stick to policy
@SpeakerRyan threw in his hat on running but his hopes lie in a VP attempt with @MittRomney running we think positive. GO TRUMP!
how can we do that when the president doesn't even see it? He doesn't admit that there is a radical side of Islam
why not background checks  for Syrian refugees? Instead our government is getting ready to impose more checks on US citizens.
Exactly. What is being done right now by the current US administration is insufficient.
Miss you, Senator. :(
Senator well spoken #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Can we protect them from your pal Tony Perkins and others like him who'd be alright with gov't murder of gays?
Только христианская исповедь рассчитана от терроризма.Ислам - исповедь наркомана.
We must protect people from religion!
https://criticalthought.me/story/guns-dont-kill-people-religions-kill-people/ …
who protects us from you? Take your rhetoric somewhere else. The people chose trump over you. How screwed up must you be.
Great speech, Ted. Way to spell it out for them.
Not to mention radical christian terrorism too. Oh, you didn't mention it. Hmmm wonder why!
you need to protect Americans from radical American terrorism
excellent job! Well said. Thank you for your service.
well said sir
@Jewmanberg Then GET ONBOARD WITH @realDonaldTrump & GET YOUR CRUZERS ONBOARD TOO!!!
Cruz is some some sort of radical booger eating exhibitionist! I want protection from Raphael AND Ted!
in order to do that we must first get rid of obama
When does it start??? There are already 54 people DEAD!
And we must protect ourselves from domestic terror. Vote to approve the background check and no fly, no buy. Prove you get it
how do you protect Americans from a born and raised American? don't let them buy an assault weapon
how did you protect the babies at Sandy Hook?
You're wrong. You protect the sovereignity or this nation, the states, and the individual. Have you protected your border? pfft!
we have a radical Islamic "President"! Do something about that!
no shit
And from you. Don't forget to include protecting Americans from Ted Cruz.
AMEN, BRO
who is playing politics? 50+ votes on Obamacare? Planned parenthood? Benghazi?
rip their delusions to shreds Ted!
Never understood why you and so many senators CO-SPONSORED THE CORKER BILL that allowed the Iran Deal.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/615/cosponsors …
#NoFlyNoBuy #DisarmHate don't let the @NRA own your soul. WWJD
Agreed.  And we must protect Americans from radical Christians as well.
We need protection from Obama and Hillary!!! Wake up Ameruca! Our country is going FAST!
What about guys like Robert Dear and Dylan Roof?
What specifically are you going to do besides talk?
yes sir!
Get back in the race already.
and we must protect our second amendment rights!! They can't be taken by a filibuster
