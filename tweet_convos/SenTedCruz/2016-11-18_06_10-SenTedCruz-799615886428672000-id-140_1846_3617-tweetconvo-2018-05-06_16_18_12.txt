Doesn't matter who 'started'-FACT: RWNJs are pushing it NOW, DIMWIT.

@SenTedCruz @RenaSummersLtd @SenatorSessions
LOL. Get an education, dear. And remove the blinders. Jesus doesn't approve of HATE
Lmao lighten up it was a joke we all have opinions&will forever believe what we want 
@SenTedCruz  @SenatorSessions
People thought pre-Nazi Germany was a 'joke', too. We need to be vigilant to the rising climate. 
Sessions' nomination as attorney general is great news for all of us who revere the Constitution and the rule of white people.
is that a Havanese profile pic?
Maltese.
U want to live by foreign countries laws great don't  come to America & Expect to change ours to suit U
Simple
.@SenTedCruz Weirdly given you’re a Cruz but you misspelled “revere white people”. @SenatorSessions
Nobody misspelled anything.
.@GracefulRuler Keep your self-portraits to yourself please.
Keep accusations of racism to yourself.
we was wanting trey gowdy for this
@Italians4Trump @SenatorSessions
 Did you give up your new world order open borders thing?
@Italians4Trump sure hope you get Supreme Court we need the constitution protected @DavidLimbaugh @transition2017
constitution requires advise /consent supreme court nomine nothing says requires 60 votes ramitthrew
@scottienhughes @SenatorSessions Couldn't be a worse choice, and wouldn't expect less from Teddy.

excellent choice a man with integrity. Ted Cruz stood with Globalists on TPP & MASSIVE AMNESTY
--- Yay! I would rather Cruz be President or maybe as Justice but I'd love to see him involved in any capacity!
Sure. A racist. Great.
@BaldEagleRising @SenatorSessions I hope it's great news for me, I refuse to die until Hillary is behind bars! Make it happen!

Only those who don't want the Rule of LAW don't want Sessions! That would be the Democrats!
Neocon statists now revere the separated, limited jurisdictions underlying the Constitution?
Great choice!
https://www.change.org/p/electoral  please sign petition to keep Trump as president
DAHNALD
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions his remarks have shown his colors. How can we allow this when he's not a federal judge?
senate found him too racist for a federal judgeship, let's make him top cop! What could go wrong?
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions great news for white supremacists and homophobes
? I've always suspected that you were a racist. Your fave senator? #Sad
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions ... and bad news for America.
C'mon Nellie, Cruz would have given his first born for the AG, so coded, I wanted it but sessions is good
@transition2017 you're joking, right? He could not get confirmed as a fed judge because of racist remarks. Yay christian white
@kupajo322 @SenatorSessions aaahhh!!! Cruz finally found his brain! Or he's just jumping on the bandwagon of a winner
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions You sir .claimed to be a natural born citizen, contrary to the Constitution and law
@SurvivorMed @SenatorSessions HeHasToBeTheBestOrHeWouldn't BeSlanderedBy @CNN #MSNBC #TheView's & @POTUS's & HRC's #Bigot Freaks
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions looking forward to @SenTedCruz contributing greatly to the team!
.   .   .   I concur! 

@SenTedCruz @shawgerald4 @SenatorSessions
He's a Constitutional Interpretive and Intellectual Giant! The Founders have a channeling voice
@transition2017 #StopSessions
Ted for Supreme Court Justice
@SpecialKMB1969 @SenatorSessions --thanks Mr. Cruz
Nothing to see here right? Because ever president-elect is called a swindler by a NY AG! #Trump
yes we approve of Sen Sessions, but don't care about lyin backstabbing cruz opinion! Do NOT want him in admin.
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions Sessions is an authoritarian who will advance the police state  That is not constitutional
@CNN @msnbc @FoxNews @transition2017 @SenatorSessions will take us down strawberry fields, nothing to get hung about - Beatles
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions This is a quote from Sessions re being the AG. Sounds like he won't give HRC a pass.
@transition2017  Really Ted? He might prosecute your father for involvement in assassination of JFK; didn't you get the memo?
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions excellent choice for AG! High respect from Missouri for Sen. Sessions
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions Shut Wall Street Now, Or Face a Killer, Chain-Reaction Crash
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions Nope. 
@transition2017 @SenatorSessions great choice!!
Jeff Sessions is a poster boy for term limits, may add you to that list
I can't understand you supporting that wacko after you stand against him, I thought about voting for you.
@GoetzSharon @SenatorSessions 
It's great to have you on board senator.
another failure. You just can't win.
this is great news
Thank You for your visit to The Federalist Society this afternoon...well received and encouraged the base
We need you on the Supreme Court!
Great as AG! @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @transition2017 @marklevinshow @TPPatriots @CR @LevinTV @SenTedCruz @SueArcamone
is like to see you or Mike Lee in the Supreme Court
great news #GoGetEm
Here Here!
Hillary pack what you want to take to Kenya before 2017. Move while you can, Justice is near.
@mlong42947 @SenatorSessions ok, where does that leave Cruz? Supremes?
Fantastic selection. #MAGA Please Sen. Cruz, if offered #SCOTUS position TAKE IT! #JusticeCruz sounds wonderful
Constitution of what country? Surely not the USA.
yes my non white friends are super excited about it 
Servile puppy dog
Great news for honesty
@RealBPhil @SenatorSessions Funny how now you like Trump because he offers you a job. You change with the wind.
Glad it's not you. You're too important to be under the fickle finger of Trump. SCOTUS=YES!
bless and thank both of you American patriots....
We need to get out of drug control treaties. The FBHO/FHRC admin should have done it years ago.
@MattMackowiak @SenatorSessions blahblahblahblah.lieliarlyingliarlies
GOD Bless U Senator Sessions! U r America's ROCK giving us "We the People" & @realDonaldTrump STEADY SUPPORT
and are racist POS's
Oh, now I am not so sure about #Sessions since #PaulRyan likes him, but Trump knows Best.
Agreed. Very refreshing to hear.
Maybe Cruz to SCOTUS? Scalia would be proud! Could he get confirmed? Maybe in round #2.
for Supreme Court! #2A #SupremeCourt
Gracious and classy of you, Senator Cruz, as always.  By now, I don't expect anything less.
todo lo que va contra latinos está bien contigo, traidor
I believe Ted may best serve as a supreme Court Justice.
Cruz for SCOTUS.
lets get to work getting our justice department back to being blind to politics. #hilaryforprison
Well said Sir. A Texas Gentleman to the end
Such great news!
it is only if he fully investigate @HillaryClinton. And the Foundation.
and white supremacy!
unless, of course, you don't think the white race is superior.
remember when he was turn down as a judge for racial comments. Now he must defend minorities. Wow
He's horrible and you sold any last amount of decency you had.
Ted, you're the new Chris Christie, sold your soul only to watch the Trump train leave you behind. Sad?
.@SenTedCruz @SenatorSessions So much #Winning!....@realDonaldTrump
I am a TX constituent. Sessions was found too racist to be judge and should not be AG. Don't make TX look bad.
I hope for the best
Roberts sold himself to Obama with the Obama Care act as a Tax.... Shame on Roberts
Very good choice but I expect you to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Chief Justice to replace Robert
@JanekaSmith1 @SenatorSessions Happy not Christie! He failed us, thousand other Sandy victims!

And those who believe that "civil rights are something to be forced down one's throat".
Thanks, Ted. Good choice, good man.
yeah. This means you for SCOTUS, right?
Awesome
Where will you be in the Trump administration? 
How will you bring change to DC?
Are you smoking crack?
When you were in high school, Jeff's nomination to the Fed bench was withdrawn: Why? RACIST!
Does he have the needed fire?
prove it. #DefundPlannedParenthood2011
Senator Cruz, a good Senator and a good man. I hope you r nominated for Supreme Court
being full of racial hate makes him a good man? Hahaha that's sick
good choice
. it's about time you smartened up @SenTedCruz
No offense, but would have loved @TGowdySC as AG. He is amazeballs. Is there a place for Trey Gowdy?
then I hope you got the scotus job
Do you have any concerns about @SenatorSessions' history of civil rights abuses? Or that blacks won't feel safe before the law?
I think that's kinda the point. Punish all who spoke up and dared to question white authority
You are so wrong my friend,the criminals will be put away,eg,chicago killers !!!!
except for Muslims and the lgbt community
yea, the 1% of the world that we bend over backwards for so they feel good! #Realitysetsin
I love Senator Sessions. @SenatorSessions  Hope they all follow through and keep their promises.
