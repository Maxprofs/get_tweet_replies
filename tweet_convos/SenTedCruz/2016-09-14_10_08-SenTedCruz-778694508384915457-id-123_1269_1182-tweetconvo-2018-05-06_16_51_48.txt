Why in the world would we even be CONSIDERING this as an option?  So stupid.
The Internet represents freedom of speech. Obama is a tyrant who seeks to remove every means of free speech.

@Callisto1947 big mistake
.@SenTedCruz
thank you for staying in the fight!
@cruzgrassroots plainly &  simply all we need to know @LamarAlexander @BobCorker who will betray their oath of office?
What Amendment covers the promise the govt gave to Veterans for Healthcare TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz while you still sit on your ASS?
Another TERRIBLE idea!  We need more Pro-Americans like you in Washington.
@Callisto1947 Personally I am getting fed up with this Globalism BS. Why would I like foreign Leftwingers ruling on my wants?
AUG152014 You want to leave it open so the next Google and the next Facebook can succeed.” -President Obama
this cannot happen
Gentlemen, PLEASE explain to me how these people are getting away with all of this corruption??? Obama/Clintons
Please keep up the good fight. Protecting our freedoms. #neverhillary
so what R we to do to stop him? Impeach every rep that votes for it after they stomp over us to strip us of our freedom of info
Is there anyone besides POTUS that believes this is really a good idea?
First don't re-tweet yourself, it makes you look alone and lonely
Second you are wrong
Conservatives will be the first targeted if this happens.
Please tell Americans what they can DO to stop this! Even writing the President is fruitless!!
Who started this Crap?
you suddenly have a rational thought? All of the sudden a free internet matters to you?
why is this Obama's option?  When does Senate and Congress step in and stop it?
THIS PRESIDENT IS HELL BENT ON RUINING OUR GREAT COUNTRY.
DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!
excellent tweet showing what's what in transferring our internet to the UN.
Obama probably got paid a LOT of money to give the muslim nations control...just saying. he and Hillary, ALL about their cash
Communists all around us using our laws, distorting their intent, and therefore subverting America & American liberty & values!
Can the US keep any of our technology? It used 2 be r strength. Internet cost us a lot 2 develop - why give it away?
well then join us to beat HRC or YOU will be one of the ones that FAILED AMERICA
This link won't open either, maybe twitter is helping you out. Grrrrr
they dont want us to know whats going on less informed equals a more controlled population, just like China & others
@TeriGRight no doubt
This is outrageous...
thanks for your help loser
Yeah and they want to fool us man. Let's cut ICANN loose and do our own Internet in the US and those who want to connect can.
Do you have any idea how long that would take @jcholl16 if IANA transition ILLEGALLY allowed =USA censor.@SenTedCruz
America can no longer ignore #IANASteward transfer > internet root naming system #ICANN will censor ENTIRE WORLD.#1a 
@Kotcha301 get onboard Ted, we need you

Which is exactly why they want to transfer control.
Thank you!
If you do not support Trump, you will be the star player on the team for abortion, secularism and leftist judicial activism.
people will start understanding when domain names are banned because they are considered a #trigger smh.
DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN! CALL YOUR SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN. WE CANT GIVE AWAY CONTROL OF THE NET 2 A GROUP OF "GLOBAL STAKEHOLDERS"
CONGRESS STOP OBAMA FROM DOING THIS. HE'LL RUIN THE INTERNET LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE'S RUINED
Don't give up U. S. control of the internet.

@whpresscorps, @cbs @abc @rupertmurdoch @cnn @loudobbs @msn @msnbc @politico
OBAMA BELONGS IN PRISON
so when are you gonna issue impeachment papers on the criminal in the White House ?
This should not even be a ? America does not turn our rights over to anyone. These politicians are friggen ridiculously stupid.
So, why would this happen?
thank you for fighting this! Why isn't everyone else! Cruz, you also need to help Trump beat Hillary now!!
dont give away anything
@RestoreHistory Yes Sir!
We are wanting to pass the internet to an entity that is "Not bound by the
First Amendment?  If you don't call....
grandstanding- pontificating- ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING- self aggrandizement NOT why you/fellow establish. @GOP elected.Self serving
This is important folks, first step into censuring everything you say!!
^SEE FOLKS?!  CALL YOUR SENATORS AND REPS TODAY, TELL THEM TO STOP OBAMA'S GIVEAWAY OF THE INTERNET!
@Blackdi51264299 As if Obama cares a wit.
@STSTWO idiotic but Dems don't care
Not one whit.
Internet belongs to the world, & was not even invented in US. Learn the history behind, then bark.
Thank you, Mr. Cruz, for continuing to bring this to light.
agree no transfer
please stop the nonsense of turning over anything we have control of to international a-holes. Keep up the good fight Senator
I thought the Internet was in Al Gore's house since he invented it.
@vjeannek
If the internet needs a savior, who better to rescue it than the most evil creation in the entire universe
umm are you always full of shit??  http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/sep/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrect-about-obama-giving-control-inte/ …
@TomFitton OK, Ted, let's see what you can do. 2020 is not far off. Make some friends and get it done!
do not let this happen
respectfully, you may want to read up on what's actually planned, and what ICANN does, before tweeting such nonsense.
Sounds like he'd prefer not to admit that they would restrict free speech. Thanks @SenTedCruz for fighting for our rights.
Political correctness has taken away right of free speech in USA.
@TomFitton DONT DO IT! BLOCK THIS BS! WHO KNOWS WHATLL HAPPEN OR EVEN WHY ODUMMA IS PUSHING 4 IT! SNAKE
If Barry is for it you know it's bad! KEEP FIGHTING TED!!
@RMConservative @frankgaffney
they count on the fact that I can't ie., Mom having a psychotic break at the moment....so frustrating but I trust YOU so...
to "privatize" it but I am sure I am missing something b/c u r concerned Obviously I need to do more research on the subject but
U no its hard to tell by the little of the hearing I saw They make it sound like "less govt" & somehow I shld b on their side...
The "eyes" have it ! This guy is full of contempt for the question and the questioner.Where are all the "rights"people?#anyone
AMERICA - LOVERS OF OUR INTERNET - YOU BETTER PAY ATTENTION TO THIS

@SenTedCruz @PatHensley14
Of course it does. LOOK AT THE CREDENTIALS OF THE GUY WHO IS FORCING IT ON US
Agreed.
GIVE THEM HELL TED!! I don't want uber liberals policing my internet. Conservatives would be silenced.
Still bullshitting I see.

STOP THEM!
WAKE UP AMERICA As America fall's the world fall's and O'bama is destroying America all to a thunderous applause from the left
This issue is going to be one of the most important and recurring battles of the next 30 years. You are on the right side.
This must NEVER happen. Block this at all costs.
This will be a favorite way to shut down all manner of businesses run by conservatives, where the Internet is a vital component.
must stop this saudi Arabia and china could control our the American peoples Internet we developed it, its ours America
it appears Obama wants to give away all our security
Ted...do you see that maybe you were not meant to be president b/c you had important work else where.make it count.fight for us!
blah blah Frankenstein
oh hell no
This would be moronic, but we are talking about the Obama admin.
I watched 5 minutes of this and was confounded   Why exactly did they decide we needed this? It violates the 1st...
If Obama gets this you will KNOW how deep this corruption goes. 
HELP TED
STOP HIM
