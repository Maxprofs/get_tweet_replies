@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz But...but...they're friends of OBAMA'S and visit the White House regularly!
@Swamper60 @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz that's their headquarters
@USVET22 @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz That's not a far-fetched notion either, they are there often
@Swamper60 @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz exactly
@HouseJudiciary

@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz #HouseofHorrors - An incredible waste of taxpayer $$$.   Another vote to repeal ACA?
@HouseJudiciary @arnold1son Will be vetoed by POTUS eventually which will prove a major point that we already know.
@HouseJudiciary @EternaFreeda damn it took them long enough
@HouseJudiciary @Avraham5772 it's about time that they woke up to that fact! appears they have been sleeping for a long time
@HouseJudiciary @ArizonaCowboy46 What will happen 2 MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD advisers in OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,& OBAMA harboring TERRORISTS
@HouseJudiciary Muslim Brotherhood is already defeated/gone...LOL.
@HouseJudiciary The Muslim Brotherhood is not currently banned in the U.S. because it is not listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz How about we recognize republicans as a homegrown terrorist org. Definately more fitting.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz If u google Bana and Muslim Brotherhood u will learn more re; Nazi connection http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=764 …

@HouseJudiciary great move, yes get on with it, and Zionism next and we can all go spend our summers on the Mediterranean peacefully
@HouseJudiciary @HonoredValor organization.
@HouseJudiciary @lisafedup

@HouseJudiciary ha just another ploy to try to make themselves look good nothing will come of this either.
@HouseJudiciary Need a lot of press coverage on this one to wake-up those who have asleep from O's Kool-aide for these 7.5 years !
@HouseJudiciary 
No surprise: Congress is in bed with @AIPAC /israel and Saudi Arabia. 

Welcome to facism.

@HouseJudiciary Erdogan is Muslim Brotherhood isn't he? It fits.

@HouseJudiciary @PoliticalShort how is it not already!?
@jgomes19801 @HouseJudiciary In short, because of Obama's DOJ
sigh.. @HouseJudiciary I thought that had already been done in the Holy Land Foundation suit? http://web.archive.org/web/20090212100153/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/November/08-nsd-1046.html … @drginareghetti
@HouseJudiciary @ChargerGreg Like the other countries in the Middle East have done years ago
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz  They've been in the White House Many times....still, good news, finally
@HouseJudiciary Wonderful!!!!
@HouseJudiciary Like Trump says: "I wouldn't be paying for that."
@HouseJudiciary You would think we didn't need to do that. Egypt knows they're a terror Org.
@HouseJudiciary how about adding @CAIRNational while still at it?
@HouseJudiciary @lgarcher45 Now your talking, keep it up.
@HouseJudiciary someone misspelled "organization" In the Twitter advertisement
@HouseJudiciary @EvilEsq Hopefully they can learn to spell as well?
.@Methos2010 you don't think the Muslim Brotherhood is an "organiation." @HouseJudiciary is probably outsourcing graphics to Pakistan.
@HouseJudiciary @melanoma321 
Next step- 
#ArrestObama & let's have a Saddam Hussein Trial where we the people charge him with Treason.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz HRC got donations?
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz That's racist...isn't it? I mean come on, it's gotta be...right?

@HouseJudiciary TY
@HouseJudiciary Good for you! Now how about CAIR...you know they are a
terrorist front.Sure they go to WH.But we know better, don't we?
@HouseJudiciary @PatVPeters WON'T HAPPEN UNDER OBAMA !
@HouseJudiciary What took so long & include CAIR in that while you're at it they're the same
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz About bloody time!
@HouseJudiciary @realBethNeale All right! You have taken action just in time to accomplish… Nothing! Now, get on with it!
@HouseJudiciary @realBethNeale arrest Obama
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz does this mean if approved by the committee impeachment will be back on the table
@HouseJudiciary But then they'll have to fire a whole lot of ppl in Os govt.Besides, they r already on the list of terrorist groups.
@HouseJudiciary @MrHinNH better get a veto proof majority on that one.
@HouseJudiciary @MrHinNH @SenTedCruz Excellent point made by @ljcambria This POTUS veto will be expeditious.
@bbryantjones @HouseJudiciary @MrHinNH @SenTedCruz It's too obvious - his admin is LOADED with them! http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sm5e17 
@ljcambria @bbryantjones @HouseJudiciary @MrHinNH @SenTedCruz what does that mean?
.@HouseJudiciary @Getoffthedambus This is only just now happening? Wow. I would've thought this would happen years ago like around 9/11! 
@HouseJudiciary GOOD
@HouseJudiciary good luck getting that passed a veto threat
@HouseJudiciary  Bout damn time. Next up: CAIR
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz get back to me when the House passes it and it's he Senate concurs!

@SoniaPennell @WeAreTheSalt1 @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz if we elect Trump then they can have it because God will turn away from us.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz  Numnuts ain't going to let that happen, bet he ends Kerry to squash it.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Somebody's gonna have to tell @BarackObama 
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Thank you Senator Cruz!
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Ok, then start by exposing & weeding them out of the White House. Enough of you symbolic vote Bull Shit!!!
@HouseJudiciary Obama is more worried about making history with our enemies then be president of the United States.
@KMosetti @jeffgully49 He's not the leader of this country.  He's the conduit for our enemies to conquer us.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Well that should make Obama and his cabinet as a terrorist organization then!
@duke1723 @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz are you being for real?
@HouseJudiciary It is wrong for Obama making plans to close Gitmo so he can give the base back to Castro.
@HouseJudiciary It is wrong for Obama to meet with Castro,No normal ties should be done with Cuba until the Castro brother's are DEAD.
@HouseJudiciary I will be in DC on or about the 8 of March to talk to the house of representatives about an impeachment vote against Obama.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Making progress
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Obama might have a pen and a phone ,Senator Cruz have an Eraser and a mute button on his phone.
@KMosetti @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz erasers don't work on pen ink.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Your campaign is sad. #CreepyCruz #DominionistLoon #SenPaisleyBathrobe
@HouseJudiciary When the UAE designates the MB & CAIR as terrorist orgs. Probably wise to follow their lead.
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Its time for the House to impeach Obama for aiding and abetting our enemies
@KMosetti @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz yeah that house is so full of fools it will never happen
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Spell check your ads before you post!!
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz Obama will veto this if it passes.
@KMosetti @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz @POTUS is in #Denial
@danmadio @KMosetti @HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz @POTUS Hardly. Hes one of them
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Dont give up on Issues like this bill
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump House Bill 3892
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz  Doesn't improve view of govt when they can't even spell "organization"
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz is this how broken our Gov't is?  How bout "put them on the list or we yank your $$$..."
@HouseJudiciary @SenTedCruz so is Valerie Jarrett resigning or going right to jail
@HouseJudiciary Hitler hated Jews and America hates Muslims
@HouseJudiciary Referred to the whole House, headline is misleading!
