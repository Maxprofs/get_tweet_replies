Ok thanks Ted. Now it's time for him to support Trump. Remember the Pledge
He said he would support him - he didn't say he would endorse him - get the facts.
I said support him. The pledge was a ploy to trap Trump. Don't get huffy
That ploy backfired then, bcuz Trump is the nominee.
Yes he knew that. That's why he signed. The others didn't see him as a real threat to be The nominee
they gotta do more than talk
i can't stand Cruz. is there someone else i could support?
.@AmbJohnBolton @tedcruz We shouldn't thank Cruz for anything. If he was voted out of office, we would ALL be better off!
#NeverGOP
@mcspocky @AmbJohnBolton @tedcruz I'm not sure why he thinks in 4 years people will vote for him to be Prez he has no spine

@darthcalvin @tedcruz True but Ted just descended to the gutter with Trump.
@ilovepirates_2 Thank you, Yrf Cruz
leading is nice but the final results is what really counts, recent history has shown us poor results in many bills
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz THANK YOU!! 
Converting our internet to INTRANET will guarantee protection of our Amendment rights.
@gagliano_b 

Why did dipshit Mitch McConnell throw the issue under the bus?
@WeThePeople4US @tedcruz Thank you JOHN.
@SenTedCruz  I'm sure @realDonaldTrump wouldn't STOP it he's a #Liberal 2 his core this is all an act 2020 @tedcruz
please talk to ANY freshman in a computer studies program. He'll explain to you why you're clueless.
We should thank cruz for helping Hildebeast get elected too, while we're at it..
That tune is so old. Cruz is standing on principal. A hard concept for you Trumpeteers I know.
that's all you accomplished anyway, getting Hildebeast in there to finish us off.. thanks u traitor
Lol! You are definitely in the Trump army. You all sounds like Parrots spewing the company line. C'mon!
Only an idiot would still be supporting cruz and Hildebeast right now..have fun voting for her
Not voting for Hilly ya Parrot. I'm just asking you to stop and think for yourself and don't be a tool.
Supporting cruz is a vote for Hildebeast, are you gay for him or something?
@diamondgirl2222 @tedcruz But why did they wait until the last minute?
REGARDLESS THE GOP AND RNC ARE DEAD TO MILLIONS...ESPECIALLY AFTER THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT..TRUMP BLEW IT
.@JudgeMoroz .@drginareghetti .@pcp152 .@MamasWranglers .@jjauthor  It should remain free.
yeah, lets let the US control it so that they can monitor everyone's communications.
You don't think some other country would monitor it, and even limit it? They already hack n2 our info.
could the UN now look into Americans Internet browsing if this is passed?
Sorry but Mr Cruz & half of the Bushes have lost my support.
I think John Wayne Cornyn and Mitchy McConnell should both thank him!!!! Considering they are both lazy!!
@ccbean1965 @tedcruz Amen
Ted Cruz has always been a warrior for liberty and the constitution... He is a true Christian Conservative!
@Bill_Donlon @tedcruz 
#RandPaul @RandPaul

great. He can stay in the senate. Not voting for him in 2020 for president after endorsing the cheeto
If Cruz supports it then it is bad for America.  Supporters of Cruz must be removed from office
he is a sell out to his own values, his family, and our country. So are you
@bladesout2011 @tedcruz  I PRAY someone in congress can stop the Obama ELECTION FRAUD... PLZ
@bladesout2011 @tedcruz  I Thank him with my whole heart..BUT we ALL need to contact our congress DAILEY 
Haha, so free for you means that one country has control over everyone else? For me, it's the opposite. Go ICANN!
Ted had to be threatened to do this foolishness Spineless Weasel!!
John, you are all over this. Please keep social media up to date on it. I talked to a friend on the hil yesterday.
@AmbJohnBolton @tedcruz
Critical Obana & Soros are stopped.
I would have on Thursday, but not now. @AmbJohnBolton @tedcruz
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz -It should never gotten to this point. Shame on our Dear Leader & shame on Congress for acting so late.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz STOP THIS TOO!
I understand they aren't doing very well there.
i think "free" isn't the exactly right adjective you're meaning to use.
I like his negotiation style...starts and ends with NO!
Nah, his support just makes me suspicious about it. Can't be good if he wants it.
@SoonerDunn @tedcruz They are not going to take America away from us! Ex-Democrats HEARUS NOV8!! TRUMP4PREZ
yeah 2024 might be his year if he keeps fighting for American rights
I thought it didn't make it into the spending bill-  No?
Nope we're too busy crying because he made nice with that bad man who hijacked our movement.
@DocWashburn
<~THX! Ur slam ?(OnSenPanel) 2 guy defending change 2 UN"Would 1st Amendment stand?"He said NO.#NAILED
Good job. Please stop Obama!
that is until Trump gains power and asks for the authority to control sites like @YouTube as he has said he wants
@bcwilliams92 @tedcruz 
Ted Cruz and his Colleagues have been Working Their Tails Off For America! Thank You! Thank You! 
#soldhissoul
I pray they succeed
This is a no-brainer, shouldn't even be up for debate! Let not evil prevail here! It's American!
This from the guys whose candidate is openly aligned with the last Soviet warlord.
.@AmbJohnBolton - Thank you @tedcruz! The  #ICANN  is much too important to give to third world dictators and thugs.
They are the last men standing.(sigh)
Ah! John Bolton also has no integrity!
I tought ppl were kidding when they said u don't know how the internet works. But it's true
Thank you Sen. Cruz
ted Cruz is a hack and should go back to Cuba.

One of his colleagues Senator John Cornyn is not on board!  Call his office and urge him to support the effort!
Yes. This is very important. Thank you Sen. Cruz et al.
there is no threat to internet freedom.  Perhaps if you bozos had brains, you'd do some good
Absolutely.
#TrumpTrain
@m0nsterlab @tedcruz  I see now you talk nice about Cruz since Cruz has said he will vote your lying trump!! Still never DJT
Thank you Ted!  You also have a Beautiful Family! and do care about America, God Bless!
Ambassador Bolton said I guess makes sense.  It's all about freedoms though.
can @tedcruz still fight this or has it been redacted from Bill?!
Great! Discussion in Congress not the WH.
Cruz is out for himself! I will never trust him!
Yes, and it will go a long way in helping them save face.
From senatorial lethargy to worthy action. It's another Festivus m i r a c l e !
certainly took them LONG ENUFF!~
will it make any difference??
congress needs to stop this its Americans Internet it belongs to us! Don't allow this to be globalized!
@SnakePlisskn Ted's "endorsement" is as sincere as a lap dance. Heidi must've gave him the blessing 4 it, 4 Ted's career sake
I'm not thanking anyone without a pine. Cruz is weak AF. Trump likes weak ppl. Ur a true clown, no strength. 
John Bolton = worst rep we've ever had in UN.
please PolitiFact what your saying is just NOT TRUE
.. So much for family values.....how much did you charge for your soul Ted? 
leave internet in us hands
we support u Sen Cruz
Thank you Ted Cruz for saving the Internet and endorsing Mr. Trump!  We are going to MAGA together
yes thanks for service you both have rendered to this country!
go john!
Most of these people posting here are idiots!
CREATED CRISIS TO TRY & SALVAGE LOZERKRUZ'S CHANCES OF ???? KRUZ IS EVIL & HE'S A MONSTER & IT'LL BACKFIRE- GOD HATES UGLY!
HOW'S IT LOOKING?WE DON'T WANT OBAMA GIVING OUR INTERNET TO HIS GLOBALISATION DREAM
guess who's laughing at you TRUMP. You stood on the stage at convention and now you have your tail bet your legs
Thank you & God bless the work you are doing for our GR8 Country. 
I just can't be politically correct thanking him, and can't help but feel it's 4 his own agenda 
.@AmbJohnBolton @tedcruz John Bolton, the weak job that would have Israel start a nuke war with Iran. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/01/AR2009070103020.html â€¦
How can this even be happening? We Americans paid for the internet, invented here.
McConnell'd
yes thank you. He always fights for us.
hopefully it can be stopped I have written both Rand Paul and Mitch McConnel #UNcensor
Thank you Ted!
We're calling our senators but what more can we do?So frustrating that our reps are not doing right by us/USA!
not on your life. This precinct chair will work to kick him out of the senate if he doesn't endorse Trump!
I do appreciate it! Now we must vote the GOP Leaders out! They are no doubt liberal light! Disgusting!
can u imagine what Hillary will do ? Especially w Supreme Court !
Principled Conservatism means, putting your nation before your ego. THANK YOU @tedcruz for uniting the @GOP @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump
Exactly. I knew he would. A principled conservative doesnt hand HC the presidency.
@LiveFreedomOrDi @tedcruz bottom line,,,, is it working???Or will Obama and the Dems get their way after the GOP caves again?
its flipping blue November 8th. The GOP is washed up
@realDonaldTrump @LynoMN OIC+IslamicLaw+U.N.+Globalism+ICANN+Terror+Censorship
yeah so Russians can hack US elections. Thanks Ted.
I agree. Didn't like what he did opting out of his pledge He doesn't deserve a credit and thank you for this debacle
LETS GO GUYS! CALL CONGRESS, TELL THEM TO STOP OBAMA'S GIVEAWAY OF OUR FREEDOM ON THE INTERNET! AND SUPPORT #PIFA!!
"free" and "under US control" are mutually exclusive things.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz now he will endorse the man who will bring Destruction , Cruz lost my respect , SELL OUT
@Rockprincess818 @tedcruz Inside that turncoat is a good legislator. Thank you Ted for fighting for us.
Should we also thank r lib elitist repugnant repubs 4 the skyrocketing debt & refusing 2 stop obama
Amen John. Congress should be treating it as a matter of nat'l security & quit screwing around! Ted is 100% correct
@dianeeldredge99 @tedcruz If he comes out for Trump nothing he does will get him credit his career is over.
its difficult for me to thank @tedcruz for anything -- I think he is a disgrace
the @tedcruz pledge > to take his toys and go home if he doesnt get his way - he is a wimp
Good  job, Ted! Sadly, the Senate will bow to Obama though. Seen this play before. Need Convention of States.
And DTRUMP for supporting Him & The cause her the only Candidate doing tht
"free under...control" do you people hear yourselves? Or just lack understanding of words, their meanings and logic?
wish @tedcruz would kiss & make up w/ @realDonaldTrump
The Internet control will be the least of our worries if HRC wins. Cruz is an idiot . He needs to prioritize !
RT @AmbJohnBolton: We should all thank @tedcruz & his colleagues who are leading the charge in the Senate to ensure the internet remains frâ€¦
get a job
@tedcruz
Very good Ted! Now board the Trump train, if he wins without your endorsement, your career is over.
I'd say on a national stage his career is over now!
Yes, but let's humor the him....
@Dbargen @AppSame @Reince @RedNationRising 
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz ARE U A MAN OF YOUR WORD?
WE SHOULD ALL ASK TED CRUZ 2HONOR HIS WORD & SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz under US control huh....like the Patriot act...
@JustMePammy @tedcruz  That's putting the cart before the horse. Why didn't the Senators hold impeachment hearings?
who is supporting the giveaway?
Thank you Ted Cruz for fighting for the sovereignty over internet and free speech!
amen and thanks very much!
..hats off
Thank the big baby? He's helping HRC get the nom so she cn destroy the SCOTUS. He cut off his nose 2 spite his face.
OORAH. Keep the internet free UN control = loss of free speech.
only an arrogant US twerp would believe 'free under US control'
Thank You So Much
Time to defund UN.Hit them where they hurt...wallet.Cant get anything done with spineless McConnell and friends.
Thank you @tedcruz.
I don't know? Has Ted Cruz thanked Al Gore?
#ICANN no Sale#
Kudos to the Sen., however he has a long way to go to redeem himself and before the election officially endor Trump
Like the IRS targeted conservatives, #ICANN given to globalists they will target non-globists from a new website
@CarSue4 @tedcruz
HONOR YOUR #PLEDGE #DISHONOR #DISGRACE
Didn't the GOP MAJORITY Senate already sell out on this issue (everything actually) with the funding bill?
A happy happy happy day for America when Cruz gets voted out.
@realDonaldTrump  Sen.Cruz & colleagues thk u for leading the efft to keep our freedom via internet. Keep fighting!
suck it up chumps,  remember president Obama was taking your guns his first 10 days in office.  Good God!
@kf4bef @tedcruz Will if it happens, and stays under US control 
Thank you Ted Cruz for everything you are doing to fight for OUR Internet. God bless...now get behind Trump to #MAGA
So out of touch with reality.  Wait a few years, no one like you will be considered electable.
#OpenTheDebates
I guarantee there is a snake in the grass here somewhere. Find it before giving any praise to Cruz.
HRH Queen Hillary I #NeitherHillaryNorTrump
you mean "free and under US surveillance" 
 
#FuckThatShit
Why in the WORLD would @POTUS want to give up control of the Internet?!?! What's next the nuclear football? @AmbJohnBolton @tedcruz
I read it was not included on the spending bill what is plan b?
Are u asking about the Saudi Plan B? @SGTROCKUSMC82 @tedcruz
only Lyin Ted has the guts to protect our porn
More guts than Donald The Duck does. #NeitherHillaryNorTrump
you can take out the word free and we know what you mea
Idiots. ICANN has absolutely NOTHING to do with Internet content.
Thank you!! Your love for this country, shines bright
Amen!
why Internet is for the world you crooks 
it's already available to the world, it's just censored everywhere else. That's the problem!
OH-kay.

#Aleppo: 81 #Syria|n civilians confirmed killed by #Assad & #Russia|n airstrikes in #Aleppo City today.
