Not a fan of government run replacement. I do want a clean repeal though.
Remember ALL the cost overruns and scandals with the #VA ??
THAT, is government healthcare 
#deathpanels 
#LOUSYcare
Absolutely. I never campaigned for anyone who promised me more government run healthcare...
#SOCIALIZEDmedicine puts the government IN CHARGE OF YOUR LIFE
#CharlieGard showed this as JUDGES decided his existence
Free Health care for everyone is better than what the US has now!
Nothing is free. Someone is paying for it.
We pay for it through taxes, I also have a great appreciation for our NHS
The majority of American households pay no income tax. Anytime government offers to pay someone else is paying.
You are an immoral hack.  You will own this healthcare fiasco which is against the will of the majority of Americans.
failure = no protection for your constituents with chronic conditions #MSActivist #AffordableHealthcare
If failure is not an option... then why do you exist?
I want total repeal and go back to our health care before OB! The reason they made OB care is to usher us into socialism ! Stop OBcare!
#GetitDone

Just needs a caption "Need more tax cuts for the rich"
Listen here troll  @Mclean_sharen "trolls with no profile pic or no Real name get auto muted" I feel the mute is harsher than the block
Go back to old HC b/f OBCare !  Have a net for the poor ! It was the best in the world b/f OBcare !
#RepealFirst
Sen Cruz: what are the main points of healthcare reform that must be included? what are you willing to cut out than ppl currently receive?
You've failed the American people. 33 million without healthcare.  Admit you screwed up and fix Obama care.  Make it better. Let UR ego go.
#FullRepeal the ONLY honest solution.
@Heritage 
#MAGA
Get Feds out of my healthcare!
Action speaks louder than words!
God I hope it fails. It's totally an option. Single payer would lift this country to new heights. Consider it Ted. Get off Trump's message.
@GOP @democrats America deserves same healthcare plan congress & staffers. Congress deserves same healthcare plan crammed down our throats
PLEASE FORGET THE REPLACE PART! Just REPEAL OBAMACARE as promised.
Thank you
@GOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan 
How about reform medicaid, improve VA, keep medicare from going broke, leave the rest of us the hell alone!
The Government needs to figure out how to run the damn VA and keep medicare from going broke before you take on healthcare.
Why did the GOP suddenly start talking about a replacement? The original promise was to get government out of Healthcare.
ALLOW ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO BUY THE SAME HEALTHCARE PACKAGES THAT STATE, FEDERAL & COUNTY EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED.
Im behind and for you & Lee.
Thank you for hard work. I wish I could clone you yo beat Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.
If Congress fails to repeal the unaffordable care act I will not blame President Trump. I will blame Cingress.
but you continue to fail, Ted, cuz that's the kind of flakes you all are
#American #RepealAndReplace do you think it's ok for my belongings to be stolen by police for any reason they want?
How? Magic beans?
Get a life senator what is your solution nothing so far in the past 7 years
#LoseCruz2018
Replace isn't nesessary just REPEAL.
Failure is not an option. It's a certainty.
This is becoming a "because trump said so"! Is this the best plan for the American people? What do the insurers think about ur revision?
For America to succeed & it's people be covered, @SenateGOP MUST fail! #NoRepeal
I'm all for you @SenTedCruz, but with the @GOP, failure is always an option.
ROTFLMAO! Just saying...that is how credible this actually is. Want to see CBO score because every other Health organization says opposite!
What do Sens Collins, Capito & Murkowsky want...bottom line, if not socialism NEGOTIATE!
Prove it.
Replace with something that Covers all! You are supposed to help all, not offer tax breaks to the rich! #NotAHealthCareSolution
Cruz is a failure. And a total sell out
JUST DO IT, SENATOR CRUZ!
Failure is not an option, its the result
Full Repeal and New Bill
Great- get to work. Twist Rand Pauls arm a bit- wrench it out of the socket if he is too stubborn.
How is that working.
Get it done
Loser. Texas deserves better than Cruz
U R playing to 12% base as a means to your end; tax breaks to 1%, erasing Obama's legacy & being a lying posturing jerk #EpicFailure
Sen Cruz is always working hard, great job, keep at it.
As in dick hard?
The #American people do not want your fuckin' #RepealAndReplace. As for your "failure is not an option" ... you've already failed... SAD
You're not going to make headway on insurance costs until you reign in Big Pharma costs.
Failure is your only option. Get used to it because I have a feeling things aren't going to better anytime soon.
as long as money is in politics... was it the Mercer family who made him phone bank for Trump after he called his wife ugly?
Ted is out eating lunch while our Soldiers are dying trying to provide his freedom.
Ted Cruz is against trump directives and orders and needs to be voted out now!
#SinglePayerNow
I trust Ted! He's got the citizens best interest at heart.
Then you have not been paying attention
But REPEALING for 2 years will take health ins away from millions of men, women, and kids. Many of whom receiving life or death treatments.
Or not. They'll go to the ER like they did for 70 years before O-Care. It is a figment of Liberal imagination.

So here is the evidence that putin is running the Oval Office here. Trump is militarily aiding Assad at putins request. Putin controls USA. https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/887762037320802304 â€¦
Now look who's attracted to shiny objects. @GOP @SenateMajLdr @PRyan @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump
A "full" repeal & replace? Seriously? You said that?
that's what I'm thinking.  where is senators Cruz?!  what did they do with him?  This is a clone!
If Obamacare is so bad why are you rich government officials keeping it. Liars
No replacement!!!! We were just fine before the ACA!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
You are the failure!
... but death is?
