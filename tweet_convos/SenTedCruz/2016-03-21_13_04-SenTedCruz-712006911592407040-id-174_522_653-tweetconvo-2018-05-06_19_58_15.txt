@SenTedCruz @POTUS @twitter I agree with the others that support online poker.  Please support the licensing and regulation of online poker.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @twitter Also keep the internet free by opposing anti-online poker legislation, like the Adelson bought S1668. Thanks.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @twitter Do you really think Americans are free? Open your blind eyes Cruz. The rich man controls this country.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @twitter Those who seek to block state-regulated #OnlinePoker engage in #CronyCapitalism and #BigGovernment.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @twitter Millions of Americans enjoy playing online #poker. Oppose SB1668 sponsored by #BigMoney. Support #Liberty 2 play
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @twitter @WSJ Please oppose efforts of a federal ban on online poker, it's a state's decision, as per the #TenthAmendment
@SenTedCruz If you believe this, please publicly oppose S1668 that bans state licensed online poker & stops their #TenthAmendment rights.
.@SenTedCruz S1668, which shuts down states' #poker websites, is antithetical to #Internet freedom & the #Constitution. Please oppose!
@RichMuny thanks for sharing Rich Muny, have a great Saturday :) (Want this FREE? >> http://bit.ly/free_tweet_thanks …)
.@SenTedCruz Please join AZ AG Mark Brnovich in opposing S1668, which would close states' iPoker. Let states decide.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Please oppose S1668, Sheldon Adelson's bill to close states' #poker websites. Let the states decide. #CronyCapitalism
