SURE, BECAUSE YOU TAKE 800 BILLION FROM OBAMACARE AND USE THAT MONEY TO GIVE ***TAX BREAK*** TO WEALTHY: SHAME ON GOP & TRUMP!
Bogus argument. You can press on with tax reform without removing Obamacare.
I can't wait to vote for @BetoORourke; a Texan that'll work for Texans!
He's a loser, he's going nowhere.
I know, right? Ted is the worst. He's only out for himself. I can't wait to put a real American/Texan into office. #BetoForTexas
Keep on dreaming. 
Nice hair cut Ted!
Cruz is correct here......let's #RepealObamacare NOW
anything crashing is republican held Senate @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @PoliticalDiscor @indtx36 @WashTimes @nytimes
you are so incredibly see through Ted
People need health care!
Then go buy it!
Great idea as soon as we STOP giving the rich sooooo many tax breaks!
I do not believe that for a second. Stop being stubborn &get tax reform done. Tell BCBS if they want to sell they will sell 2everyone
Stop talking, replace Obamacare, build the wall and cut taxes!
Oooo more lies
Replace Obamacare? Of course we will! said the Wizard of Odd...and...uh...er...pay no attention to the Republicans behind the curtain...
You had SEVEN YEARS. What a complete and utter failure by you &'entire @GOP
Then prepare for the burn because the GOP plan only benefits the rich insurance companies and is worse than OBAMACARE; & I'm a republican!
when all the politicians who got donations from insurance companies give it back then maybe i will believe you really want to repeal.
Democrats want no victories for President Trump!
TED, you can do both. Tax cuts for people and business is not not dependent on ACA. C'mon. That is an excuse to fail.
Congress need a better bill that polls well and that Congress participates under.
That's their plan!! #VoteThemOut
Why? Because there is no place to hide taxes?
is it because both are bad?
Looks like you will be doing a Coyote impression. <meet meep>
And you will all be out of a job!
Why should i watch the 15 sec video if you are tweeting the quote?
Any chance justice will be done?
correct.
Another asskisser for Trump.  You're a "shining" example for those kids...and clearly a chivalrous husband. Rodents don't change.
Then get it done! Like pulling teeth!
You are killing #Americans by cutting funds for #Obamacare. Your bill is horrible it'll cause 22,000,000 more Americans to lose insurance
all the more reason to resist the disastrous health care plans!  the tax reform is just another massive handout to the top 1%...
Most of Tax Cuts Go to Top 1%
@GOPChairwoman The fate of our @GOP majority is with @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan
Obamacare and tax reform and rich white repubs making more money off the sick and poor intertwine. Less sick less money.Less poor less money
good job Senator..  get the others to agree...
Hope ALL know messing with our livelihoods 4 personal gain will fail! We see Corruption! GET HC & TAXES DONE NOW!
Long Live O'Care!
It's already done. It's over. Capiche?
#Medicare4All, eliminate Medicaid and other dumb programs
GET IT DONE, ALL OF IT!
Have a backbone, and stand up for REAL #Republican  principles . Real #TaxReform , national flat sales tax, dividend, int, excise. Simple!
We the people want a clean repeal first. Then we'll trust legislators to find way to help those who are truly unable 2 help themselves.
Tax reform, as currently spoken about, is as bad as Obamacare repeal. Let each bill stand alone. The big problem here is lack of leadership.
Real #TaxReform , or just a Corp tax cut. Hope you insist on real pAyment based flat taxes. End income taxes, use payment based taxes.
Do it already!
WooHoo! #CruzIsRIGHT!! #TrusTed 
#CruzTX2018
I don't agree. Cutting taxes on Americans helps Americans. Maybe they could then afford to pay the healthcare fine!
#MAGA @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @RandPaul @marcorubio
push your amendment as a stand alone bill @SenTedCruz
The only person that should be fired or the Republicans for not doing what they promised. We don't blame Trump we blame the Republicans
Not a good reason to pass your bill dropping millions off healthcare, do better.
Your healthcare plan is a tax bill itself. #TrumpCare #TaxCutsForRichDicks
This sounds bleak bc this is exactly what the Dems, elites & media want, a crumbling America. It appears the reps do too, very sad.
Trying to hold healthcare hostage so you can move on... What is good about this bill? 22 mill? Higher premiums? Less coverage?
What America wants from tax reform, see attached. Healthcare is a Human Right.
Rino #GOP need pressured as the People have voted multiple times 4 a #FullRepeal of #Obamacare. We demand what we were promised! @SenateGOP
'If you let us grope ya on healthcare, we'll really bend you over on taxes.'
Stop the bullshit.
I don't see the connection with tax reform. What I do see with tax reform is spending cuts. Major spending cuts and not from DOD.
"if we can gut the $800B going to Medicaid it allows us more room to make our tax giveaways to Amazon,WallStreet Hollywood bigger.
If O'Care doesn't get done and Tax Reform doesn't get done as @POTUS had set, the odds of GOP owning House and Congress drop significantly!
lmao it's not tax reform if it's just a tax cut for 1 bracket. Look at what he's saying here.

Repeal #Obamacare. THEN start the #healthcare replacement debate here:  https://files.acrobat.com/a/preview/11996a07-db43-405a-a8bf-97b352b67c3e â€¦ Complicated = Corrupt.



No 'if' .
From the Bible thumper who is pro-life 
We can see in your soul Ted. Cold and dark.


Texas is turning blue thankfully.

Stop the B.S excuses and Repeal that POS..we don't want or need it replaced !
