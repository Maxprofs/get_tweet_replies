@SenTedCruz great system but YshouldTeacherNeeds 2 teach in Common Core Standard & Y is State involve? Senator something fishy
@SenTedCruz yeah but the schools should be free and at no cost to the taxpayers
@SenTedCruz @EmfingerSScout Put the Corn Cobs Where The Sun Don't Shine ! Phony Rubio & Cruz Castro Brothers #justsaying
@SenTedCruz the GOP destroyed great public schools in Texas the past 30 years & now is all about #Greed not #Education for all
@SenTedCruz  And America should be able to choose a REAL AMERICAN to be our POTUS!!!  http://www.newswithviews.com/JBWilliams/williams300.htm …
@SenTedCruz You mean one where they teach the children that the earth is flat and it was created 6000 years ago? #imbécil
@SenTedCruz Charters have been found to charge those w/govt vouchers more, charters refuse to keep proper books for review, too many probs
@SenTedCruz @YouTube Just as long they are public schools. Not your religious fake schools that preach fear and hate. Oh, there is no DOG.
@SenTedCruz Ok. Dude lets start fighting back against @realDonaldTrump   You look weak.
@SenTedCruz The school system is hugely at fault for our worst issues, while we work the left is raising our kids.
@SenTedCruz you're such a fake Ted. #Canada #Iowa #tcot
@SenTedCruz
.@SenTedCruz Who paid for all those yellow scarfs? #School Choice = No Voice! #ProCommonCore #JebBush #AboutTheChild
@SenTedCruz Funny Because the GOP Will make Education UNAFFORDABLE and take away PeLL Grants, and other FED LOANS
You Sir -> @SenTedCruz are brain dead- #CommonCore is indoctrination, like #NoChildLeftBehind!

@SenTedCruz @ForAmerica hear the interview with pastor Cruz today on Megan - good stuff
@SenTedCruz @Reagan_Girl
@SenTedCruz @YouTube REAL public       schools should be funded 2 meet kids' needs. Privatization rhetoric is getting old, is based on lies.
@SenTedCruz We need fully funded PUBLIC schools, not charters or vouchers. So you support corporate driven privatization agenda. Good 2 know
@SenTedCruz @YouTube I live in NH, but I'd like my child to go to school in CA. How's that work. Do you even think before your mouth opens!
@sentedcruz @rodtatro Public Schools need to get OUT of the Transportation Business, the Budget for Busses is ENORMOUS,
@rodtatro @sentedcruz Tech Schools should be performing all repairs and maintenance , painting, mechanical, Upholstery, etc.etc.
@SenTedCruz *white people choose the best schools while POC get the shaft. This is more separate but equal BS. Go pretend to care elsewhere.
@SenTedCruz Sounds fine, but schools have given up teaching things that give kids solid training for blue collar jobs (manual arts, etc.)
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad  these politicians sure to have good ability to morph into the frontrunner - don't they
@SenTedCruz CRUZ AND OTHERS LIKE HIM JUST WANT MY TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THEIR KIDS PRIVATE SCHOOLS!! BULL!!
@SenTedCruz PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE WHAT MADE AMERICA GREAT IN THE 20TH CENTURY!!
@SenTedCruz As long as no tax dollars ever go to support religious schools, I agree!
@SenTedCruz repeal common core!!!
@SenTedCruz When reading your book A TIME FORTRUTH,  it was o interesting and true, I couldn't put it down.,
@SenTedCruz @YouTube Thank you for speaking up for poor inner city kids who can't attend private schools like the Obama's.

@SenTedCruz school choice is my #1 issue. It needs to happen nationwide!
@SenTedCruz they can, they're called private schools...
@SenTedCruz Yes, but you'd have "home schooling" declared a school & funnel our tax dollars to any idiot parent teaching whatever suits them
@SenTedCruz What about freedom to determine what vaccine or med their child receives? I hope as a conservative you support all parent rights
@SenTedCruz yes, and again it really helps the poor children,Ted?
@SenTedCruz Harmony Charter School my son is in has serious issues. I contacted your office about it.
@SenTedCruz There is no mention in Art. I Section 8 or anywhere else in the US Const for the Feds to be involved in Education.  #10thAm
AMEN @SenTedCruz #SchoolChoice #AnyZipCode #CharterSchools #GrassrootsRising #ConservativeInsurgency we will reignite the promise!!
@SenTedCruz @TeaPartyNevada Cruz stop taking Rubio lines u copy cat
@SenTedCruz divided our children fall
@SenTedCruz @THETXEMBASSY Sen. Cruz. if you are honest, can you explain this audio to us?
@SenTedCruz I'll bet Donald Trump would never say that.
@SenTedCruz #superpacs #GoldmanSachs #owned #unreportedloans #amnesty #H1B #NorthAmericanUnion #Canadian
@SenTedCruz No, Society says we must be diverse so no one has the right to go where diversity isn't the first and foremost consideration:>)
@SenTedCruz Would then stand to reason parents/all citizens should have a choice in their religion. Key words... freedom of choice.
@SenTedCruz Translated: End public schools. #DupingTheRubes2016
@SenTedCruz Amen Senator! Modern American "education" is nothing but leftist indoctrination.
.@SenTedCruz The fact that some parents will vote for Ted Cruz is proof that they should not be trusted to choose their children's schools.
@AnotherEitan @SenTedCruz Why because the system of indoctrination failed? we are not all assimilated?
@SenTedCruz  If I want a Canadian's opinion, I'll ask William Shatner.
@JCESQ82 @SenTedCruz When a monkey doesn't have anything smart to say he just throws pooh, and sometimes worse.
@TheeBudman @SenTedCruz  I agree, Cruz is a moron.
@SenTedCruz except many don't. They pick a school that matches the skin pigmentation of their child.
@TheJuanGShow @SenTedCruz Are you saying integration is the sole purpose for denying parental rights?
@wilkowfan I'm saying what I said. It was pretty clear. Don't read too much into it, and please don't put words in my mouth.
@SenTedCruz
@TheJuanGShow @SenTedCruz You made an absurd comment. You turned took Ted Cruz's msg about parental choice into a racial issue. Your words.
@wilkowfan that's your opinion, and I'm ok with you having one. @SenTedCruz
@TheJuanGShow @SenTedCruz It's not my opinion. It's what you said.
@wilkowfan "You made an absurd comment. You turned took Ted Cruz's msg about parental choice into a racial issue. Your words." <-all opinion
@SenTedCruz ... You are loved and prayed for!  Thank you for your heart!!  It's a badge of honor that DC hates you!!
@BubbieMcBrisket @SenTedCruz I COMPLETELY AGREE♡
@SenTedCruz Nope. Sounds OK on the surface; is just another scheme for the rich.
@SenTedCruz I don't recommend Harvard! Their students on Constitutional law (like you and Obama) are often just wrong!
@SenTedCruz what happens when too many parents choose same school? not enough seats for every student. better to #reinvest in #PublicSchool
@texasquire @SenTedCruz Supply and demand takes over. The school everyone wants their kids would expand while the lousy ones close.
@wilkowfan @SenTedCruz maybe. some kids just get stuck in low-performing schools in meantime. market = rationing mechanism -> winners/losers
@texasquire @SenTedCruz Kids are stuck in low performing schools already. So are you saying all must advance at once or nobody advances?
@wilkowfan @SenTedCruz better to fix existing schools; no guarantee market will  supply more/better. what's missing? political will.
@texasquire @SenTedCruz Public schools can't be fixed because they're run by the gov't. The root problem is the lack of accountability.
@wilkowfan @SenTedCruz real problem is reliance on property tax for funding -> poor districts lack resources  -> failed schools
@texasquire @SenTedCruz Do you stop to think about why some districts get poor in the first place?
@SenTedCruz and homeschoolers should get tax credits?
@SenTedCruz  Exactly right!
@SenTedCruz that's thrash talk Ted, what u really should be thankful for is for the tax payers money Ur wasting campaigning
@SenTedCruz this doesn't apply for minorities though right ?
@mochajava77 @SenTedCruz What a ridiculous thing to say!
