@FoxNews @DeborahLovesUSA I've been out of touch, isn't Scalia the Supream Court justice whose funeral Obama could not be bothered to attend
@DeborahLovesUSA @FoxNews Thanks, as they say a scumbag is as a scumbag does.
@FoxNews @mlong42947 // These men are getting scarce,but I have faith in Americans down the road especially when I see those who serve .
@FoxNews Please, Fox, presidents do not "appoint" Supreme Court justices. Presidents "nominate" candidates and Senate votes. It was 98-0.
@FoxNews @trixienovel Last guardian of our Freedoms.
@donttreadonme53 Sad; Prayers For a Revival in the Land @FoxNews

@FoxNews @TimCuthbertson A true American Hero and legal genius
@FoxNews @SenTedCruz Scalia who had "no recollection" of lying sleazebag Ted Cruz who claimed to know him. More Cruz lies.

@FoxNews @tedcruz If only we could get eight more like him on Supreme Court... America would experience a true Renaissance.
@FoxNews Thank you for honoring Justice Scalia and his family. Please give a positive report about him to the family, friends and the public
@FoxNews @tedcruz  over 79% of all Americans think he was murdered!
You trashed and denigrated his dear friend @tedcruz while he attended Justice Scalia's funeral. You call that honoring @FoxNews @TeamCavuto?
@Nopropaganda @tedcruz @FoxNews @TeamCavuto Fox has gone off the deep end.#FoxSux

@FoxNews @tedcruz The Lord has spoken!  One more racist, homophobe, misogynist, bigot off our planet!  Hip hip hooray!!
@FoxNews @tedcruz Who was just murdered. Why no autopsy ?
@FoxNews @DJGreenwald they should look into it
@FoxNews @DJGreenwald rip
@foxnews Security risk for Obama, so he stays home and didn't go to funeral.  Family asks him not to come.
@FoxNews @tedcruz
@FoxNews @tedcruz Wow!  Like Mick Jagger once said, "What a drag it is getting old."
@FoxNews 

God bless Antonin Scalia and my deepest condolences to his family.  He was one of the greatest defenders of the US Constitution
@foxnews @tedcruz Obama stays at home today, dis-invited from funeral no prayer rugs available.
@FoxNews @tedcruz #HEREHERE!!
@FoxNews @Montana0323
@FoxNews @JosephEach SIMPLY THE BEST!
@FoxNews @JosephEach The very reason why Obama will not attend funeral, pic says it all
@FoxNews Two Great Men! The "Best of the Best", So glad they were Americans !
@FoxNews two pieces of shit in one photo!
@FoxNews Honor Justice Scalias by Demanding an immediate investigation into His Death RED FLAGS!  RED FLAGS!!! Danger Will Roberson Danger!
@FoxNews may he rest in peace. Thank you for serving our country!!
@FoxNews two great man for Christ
@FoxNews Two sorry pos.. Good riddance.
@FoxNews This great man will be missed. Hold the line & stop Obama from ramming through some Libtard judge that'll tip the scales far left!
@FoxNews ...No wonder our country has been tanking ever since...
@FoxNews Let's temper our worship with facts!
@FoxNews @mercedesschlapp RIP
@FoxNews A great man who will be missed. RIP
@FoxNews -Two great men with visions of what America can be!
@FoxNews just another example of the spectacular things Reagan did in the WH. #America

@FoxNews @tedcruz @chuckschumer Why doesn't anyone want to find out IF Scalia was murdered?
@FoxNews horrible!
@FoxNews let that sink in he was appointed by Reagan. Can we say the same 4 Presidents from now about an Obama justice?
@FoxNews One of the few touted conservative justices who did not turn out to be closet left wingers.
@FoxNews Sooo..we're still not looking into unexpected death of Conserv SCJ at ranch of Dem donor w/ no autopsy, tox? Move on? @ChuckNellis
@ChuckNellis @brobs1971 @FoxNews what illness are you referring to?  Or are you just making stuff up?
@FoxNews if you really cared so much then stop being controled and do your job and investigate who killed him! U R A SELLOUT TO THE USA
@FoxNews #SnapdealCheatSellers :http://indianonlineseller.com/2016/02/snapdeal-sellers-retaliate-miffed-with-the-etailers-unjust-penalties/#comment-9896 …
@FoxNews :Mr. Ronnie just didn't feel talk of black progression, nor G.W., G.H.W., or Jeb.  "The Black Destructionists".
@FoxNews There needs to be an autopsy! The hypocrites on the left would demand one too! Nobody trusts this administration!
@DubsterCali @FoxNews he was 80, overweight, high blood pressure, and had one of the most stressful jobs possible. Autopsy is unnecessary
@MorganHassig @DubsterCali @FoxNews Also a life long heavy smoker. The question is not how he died. It's how he lived so LONG!
@FoxNews two destructive pieces of shit
@FoxNews If you really cared so much then you would stop being controled and investigate who murdered him! Sell Outs
@FoxNews @ForPresi 
The Justice deserves full recognition!
@FoxNews reagan also appointed justice kennedy late in his 2nd term in a situation similar to obama's situation right now too.
@FoxNews Don’t let Obama-Clinton destroy the great things Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has done.
@MAGA_1958 @FoxNews no autopsy?  Really.  I heard Barry wants his pillow back.
