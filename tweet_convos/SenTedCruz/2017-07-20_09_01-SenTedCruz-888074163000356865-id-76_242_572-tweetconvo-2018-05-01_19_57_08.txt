Why doesnt he and his colleagues have any thoughts about the people they represent rather than say something they will never do #MAGA

Like you stood for your wife and your father when Trump bashed them?
Ha ha ha...
Many things r said in elections. The only thing that matters is that Ted is a Patriot and wants the best for the people.
#LoseCruz2018
AMEN! #WeThePeople Have ALL the POWER & Need 2Shut Down this #WitchHunt & Congressional Fiasco by Electing REAL #Congress Representatives
What witch hunt?
Witch Hunt of trying 2 find something ILLEGAL i.e. #RussiaCollusion #RobertMueller within #Trump Administration or previous Campaign!#MAGA
If it wasn't illegal,why didn't Kush disclose it? Why did Junior initially lie and say it was about adoption? If it was a-ok, no need to lie
NO need to disclose either. Your convinced b/c of your pathetic #Liberal #Democrat Ideology! I'm convinced otherwise b/c I KNOW THE LAW!
I'm trying to have a legit conversation here with facts. No name calling.
U don't have any facts. LookPresident Trump nor ANYONE in HIS ADMINISTRATION did anything against the law=THE END! Sorry if #Liberal bad
Also, are you familiar with money laundering and the legalities of it?
Hilary leave people to die took tons of Russia money morons
Cannot wait until 2018 when I cast my vote against you and your corrupt party!
Thank you Ted Cruz for your actions and taking care of America! We support you!!
Americans find GOP promises excludes  human caring includes
The poor Extinction
The elderly early demise
The sick euthanasia 
Rich thrive
the 4 talking points listed are planks straight from the DNC, including Bill Nye calling for the elderly to die soon. What a MAROON!
Planks or pranks?
You mean free to die under your health plan?
I have never seen so many people that are as dumb as you.  You believe everything Dem leaders say.  Obama lied and bragged about it
Americans freedom is in the evil hands of the GOP who's promises are demonic and destroys America as we dream of it. (2)
You really are demented

I wish he would of been president over trump
I truly get motivated when conservatives stand up. Thanks Sen Cruz, praying for your team.
Really stand up for luberty i wish they would do that for real instead of grandstanding for the cameras #2020 run in his sights thats all
Doesn't liberty include the freedom of choice?
So True!
The deceit of Trump knows no bounds, either.

Sign the petition for a new investigation of building 7
@SpeakerRyan Another great public speaker, but they say nothing except "feel good about yourself" , stand with me! But for WHAT? RESULTS???
...got the ACA temporarily reprieved, despite those who would've done so to further their personal goals over their constituents intetests.
Mueller n his cronies need to be FIRED!
Amen and Amen
Cruz is a big joke with no credibility. I don't believe a man who won't stand up & defend his own family from Trump will fight for the US.
Senator Cruz, another magestic picture. Very Trumpian.
Change senate rules to make it possible to repeal any law or bill passed by reconciliation using the same reconciliation process
Yes that is right, like how we the people stood up to a dangerous & irresponsible GOP who tried to take away our healthcare #Resist
Many ppl don't know what it's not having liberty-want Marxism. US's already in economical trouble-needs economical president. Not politician
Cruz stands for himself and his wealthy donors as he destroys the country.  He's a Cuban Fascist who has no business being here.
Shut up, Ted.
We did rise up to fight your Junk Insurance scam. 2018!
I believe (and I'm sure Heidi would agree) U R a lying snake who would & did (wife & father) sell out anyone to promote yourself. #LyingCruz
Thank you,Senator Cruz,for standing up for the Constitution,and the American people.
I'm preparing the tar and feathers Ted!
Sorry you're not important enough to be first, but you're on the list, somewhere.
Americans want a complete Repeal of Obamacare without 1 tax $ going to insurance companies or planned parenthood!
Act like an adult and buy health insurance, were sick of paying your ER debts.
Unfortunately, Ted Cruz doesn't "stand" for anything. He's still the kid that got stuffed into lockers.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz the president stands with Putin denounce our adversaries @MSNBC @PoliticalDiscor @indivisibletxjc
2018 Cruz will lose.
Yep, Americans stood up and #trumpcare was halted.  Listen to your constituents.
FreedomWorks = Koch brothers sponsored advocacy group for enriching billionaires...
BWAHAHAHA Weinie Cruz, trump brown noser deluxe, talking about rising up! That is supremely funny!
You want to see people rise up? Check back in 2018.
Great thought ! Wish everyone would !
Your in it for yourself politics is only slightly less egregious than 45's selling out. @BetoORourke 2018
Go to http://www.impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org  and vote! The world is not safe with Trump in the WH! #25thAmendmentNOW #Trumpincompetent #Russiagate SAD!
Teddie's definition of Liberty:  Please feel free to die.
The real question is...Is there an action we could take that will insult a decent, honorable man like Obama, without screwing our base? Hmm?
You are one of the few my friends and I trust in government don't ever lose that!!!

In case you haven't noticed, an overwhelming majority of Americans are standing together AGAINST Trumpcare!! It is the opposite of care.

freedom for men, not women - hopefully you'll be reincarnated as a woman
Down Goes Trump!!
lyin ted looks like a cross between a russ troll and a rainbow goblin

But but, I thought it needed to be see through so Americans aren't hit by 60 sacks of drugs 
2018 we need to send more folks to clean the Swamp!#SickofDC
We will see this power when Texas elects Beto. Start packing.
Feel the #Betomomentum !!!
LOL Thursday Thoughts? Is that like deep thoughts?
Your problem is the people are standing up and demanding that we don't spend 18% of GDP on health. Your "freedom" toolbox has no answer.
The 40k dead (w/o Cruz amendment) will have a more profound response to extra freedom. Ted's contribution will free even more!
