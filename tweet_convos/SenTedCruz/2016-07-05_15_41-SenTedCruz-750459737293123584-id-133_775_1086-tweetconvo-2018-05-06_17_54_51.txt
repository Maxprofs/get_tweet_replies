@ohululu DOJ, FBI, IRS, SCOTUS, ....
Agree 10%
it is quiet depressing to realize that our USA Government has become corrupt as we all can do nothing.
funny how the DOJ and Obama admin want more gun laws but they cant even enforce National Security statutes
@pambesteder but if you don't get behind the republican nominee @realDonaldTrump you will change non of it
Perhaps you all should have thought of that when accusing Cruz Snr of assassinating JFK @pridbor5 @SenTedCruz @pambesteder @realDonaldTrump
Ted Cruz should not ever endorse. Nothing trump does or says should be ok to Rs
become VP TO TRUMP. I said from the start
That's not going to happen. Because you, and your orange clown don't deserve his support. @Blazing_Ben @SenTedCruz
@LaydiHD Obama is a fraud. http://www.thepostemail.com/09/17/2010/there-is-no-president-obama/ ….  You are also a fraud.
so agree with you on him
@GaetaSusan politicized is nice for corrupt
But you still won't endorse Trump?
Amen SenCruz!My heart smiles2hear a qualified leader speak the truth,just simply because it's the fact.AmericansDESERVEHonesty!
@keithvlasak indeed. why did you let that happen?
@dtalley1952 and the most divided nation
@Ganshohawanee Senator ignore the trump trolls trying2bully u in2 sup that snake conman. He is a man4whom morality doesn't exist
@adagioforstring   Actually Ted, the apparatus of the govt in which you float is corrupt stuff. No more surprises;  convictions.
@Mariatweets3 and the most corrupt
our government is corrupt.
@GaetaSusan because of the lack of accountability from too many. This is our new flag
@GaetaSusan  and yet MR CRUZ you all with your money and power sit on your thumbs. The govt is hijacked by Islam and corruption
@GaetaSusan so do something about it. You can start with impeaching James Comey
Please endorse DT the Republican Nominee. What is wrong with you. #NeverRubioCruzRyan
@STSTWO and the most corrupt
It is now the DOU  the Department of Unjustice
@dryheat115 and the senate and house have done what to " check and balance" this problem, besides complain on twitter?
@kinsman59 #JamesComeDy
@RestoreHistory add corrupt to that statement and I can support it.
@LSUFAN869 really? How about the Bush AG that approved torturing our prisoners? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos …
@pambesteder Under President Obama we have seen the FORMATION of the Department of INjustice!
That's why I voted for you @SenTedCruz @RestoreHistory
@HeyTrudi Department of Injustice rather  First Eric Holder and now @LorettaLynch  two of the same kind Political pawns
@set1958 maybe you should support Trump, like you pledged you would.
@Poptartmom   You are too kind...how about criminal there bud???
you're implying he's the cause of it, but correlation is not causation. Try learning about science and statistics. Or just quit.
may be the legislative branch could provide some oversight, if only we had a majority in either house........
Its right there with the bush admin. But still gross that i agree with you
@jimdep so more the reason you need to back and support MR.TRUMP when will you finally do this.
Bingo. She probably has the goods on Potus so Bill made a trade deal.
Actualy under Obama we have endured the most dysfunctional Congress in history and witnessed the Republican Party collapse
How about that @SenTedCruz @Poptartmom ? Legacy of @LorettaLynch Why did GOP Confirm this EVIL? http://poorrichardsnews.com/obamas-ag-nominee-has-seized-904-million-in/ …
Oh look who has opinions on politicization!
@SenTedCruz #LyinTed
Under President Obama, we have seen the most politicized Department of Justice in history http://bit.ly/29fxumL 
@sarobards POLITICIZED? CRIMINAL!!!!!!!
I'm finding your chaffing and posturing quite hilarious. Loser.

@dwinegar1957 "Corrupt" more apt describes today's events
@dw2025rmeat Then get behind Trump already and stop helping Hillary. Your followers are hell bent on making Hillary president.
@SenTedCruz
Bullsh*t, GW tried to stack his judiciary with lackeys then lied about and deleted 22 million emails to hide it.
under the Obama Clinton admin the dept of justice has turned in to the dept of JUST US.what a disgrace.
Thank you Senator for being the ONLY vote against FBI Director Comme (sp.) @ChuckNellis @JohnFromCranber @Dlw20161950
Rand voted against him too.
Obama is the best most honest President. Way better than Reagan or either Bush. He got a lot done in spite of GOP obstruction
WHAT A BUNCH OF BULL ON YOUR PART!
when do we hear the cry of tyranny?
it's over Teddy you screwed up. Now look at what is left Donald. No worries Hillary will still kick Azz
and don't forget the least effective Congress
Senator Cruz, you're being too nice. We've now seen the most 'corrupt' Dept of Justice in history.
a few disturbing things in the last Administration what did u  do mr. Cruz Free Fair elections in Iraq lets try America senator

: Enough of this undocumented Muslim president Obama and his administration.
Exactly...so unless endorse Trump...YOU'RE supporting it. Grow up. Get behind OUR candidate. Endorse Trump.
You can't possibly touch #Whinylittlebitch, @realDonaldTrump, with you weak hyperbole.
@fancyprimates
when will you come on board and unite to defeat the Clinton dynasty. The trump train is coming
Says the guy who read Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor in a POLITICAL stunt.
"transparency" goes with 'hope and change' ... all just political jargon!!
throw your hat back in the race...this country needs you
@camacho_go wtf does that mean, aren't you part of that too?
@twright55 how about the most corrupt and negligent
ROTTEN TO THE CORE,  A REAL A/H FOR 8 MISERABLE YEARS , A DIS-GRACE
God help us please
Under President Obama, we have seen the destruction from within
As a Vietnam Vet, the DOJ s/b renamed the DONoJ. I'm ashamed to be a citizen. I wish my father had never immigrated.
we have seen the worst president in American history as well
you politicize every situation even trying shutting down our Gov. for your political advancement
Hillary may appoint Obama as SCOTUS Justice if she's elected 
and yet you refuse to endorse the one man who can stop her. You're #PartOfTheProblem
Nixon's DOJ was so bad, many were convicted and served time.  You knew that, but it wouldn't fit your rhetoric.
@SenTedCruz
He got that from the rep that didn't STAND UP FOR THEIR MAN.U CHANGED RULES Y CANT HE..THE DEMS THE REP.AMERICANS WERE LAUGHD AT
Why not just call the spade a spade - it's the most corrupt cause he's a POS!
Didn't you intend to say 'Department of Shari'ah Law' because it's definitely not Justice.
Will any Foreign Nation or US Intelligence or Armed Forces Dept TRUST #HillaryClinton with past & future SECURITY?
@Appsame #EU
@ap.@nypost.@judicialwatch.@heritage.@gop.@berniesanders.@washtimes.@ihs4defrisksec.@9dashline.@fbi.@cia.@nsa.@euronews.@dwnews.@bbcworld

Really? Ever?
and the most biased and racially driven congress in history. Please delete your account His approval rating is higher than yours
We certainly have! Decent people all across our land has just been slapped right in the face!
Senator lets cut the crap, Trump isn't the enemy Hillary is get on board, yes the campaign was down and dirty time to move on
.@SenTedCruz And Congress just looked the other way for the past 7.5 years..Good job!!
our legal system took a step back today and proved the little guy has no chance only the rich have rights. Sad day
you are talking about Trump right? It's against the law to sulk and run for President
And the Do Nothing, SPLINELESS Congress keeps giving him a blank check and allows the lawlessness.
Please clean house!!!!!!!!!
A very sad day in history for us.
Leftist radicals are gonna leftist radical....
Amen
Amen
