@SenTedCruz Why don't "The American people" who voted for the current president count for the next 11 months?
@MuthrBear  2012 Senate went Republican w a mandate to STOP Obama. Ever heard of advise & consent?  @SenTedCruz
@lisakelly_sun 2012? You mean the same "2012" when the President was re-elected? Interesting "mandate" you've got there... @SenTedCruz
@MuthrBear Read the Constitution. It's a joint effort between the people & executive. @SenTedCruz
@lisakelly_sun ..."the people" mind you, elected this POTUS...why do their voices stop counting 11 months early? @SenTedCruz
@MuthrBear "the other people" elected a Republican senate. Elections have consequences, dear @SenTedCruz
@lisakelly_sun That's the pt. 2012 Sen races did not cancel the 2012 Presidential election, no matter how much they wanted it 2. @SenTedCruz
@MuthrBear Yes they did & this is one indicator. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz They did. Obama was elected twice.
@Iacoguy 2012 Senate went Republican w a mandate to STOP Obama. Ever heard of advise & consent?  @SenTedCruz
@lisakelly_sun @SenTedCruz And who was elected president, chief?
@Iacoguy Installing new justices is a joint effort between Executive & Legislative branch. @SenTedCruz
@lisakelly_sun @SenTedCruz Yes, dear. And when one refuses to do their job?
@Iacoguy @SenTedCruz The People spoke in 2012. The part that didn't vote for Obama.
@Iacoguy Or perhaps you don't understand  checks & balances? @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz We did in 2012, dickhead
see that is the problem with you liberals, you don't give a damn about the rights of others or the constitution @tbogg @SenTedCruz
@bakerlarry84 @tbogg @SenTedCruz lol. Show me in the Constitution where it says the last year of a President doesn't count.
@ZenPopArt Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2,3. Advise & Consent. 2012 Senate went Republican w a mandate to STOP Obama.   @SenTedCruz
@lisakelly_sun @SenTedCruz Read your Constitution. We have 1 President (Obama!) and he SHALL nominate. Don't like it? Win the White House.
@ZenPopArt @SenTedCruz Don't like the check on President called Advise & consent? Win the Senate.
@lisakelly_sun @ZenPopArt @SenTedCruz That's a check on the merits of a particular nominee, only. Republicans obstructing in advance!
@Tandrena31 @ZenPopArt C'mon! That's just media & Obama trying to coerce Rs into filling slot w a liberal. Ds would be behaving same.
@SenTedCruz We will when Trump is in the WH
@SenTedCruz then why not just advocate to elect Supreme Court Justices? Why bother with the Constitution at all?
@SenTedCruz They already did. Your politically based refusal to do your job violates your oath before God. #shame
@SenTedCruz we just decided that we will let President Obama decide for us.
@SenTedCruz the American people should get to pick our President too.   We pick @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz and they chose President Obama to make that decision
@SenTedCruz they did when @POTUS was elected twice
@SenTedCruz SINCE WHEN? THE CONGRESS&SENATE HAVE NOT DONE WHAT 98% OF AMERICANS WANTED FOR 8 OR MORE YEARS.
@SenTedCruz we did when we voted for President Obama. Right Mr. Constitution?
@SenTedCruz The American people never do the deciding.
@SenTedCruz They don't get to.  Senate approved Sotomayor, Ginsberg and Kagin AGAINST the will of the American people.  Look where we are.
@SenTedCruz @drginareghetti CRUZ RUNS ON LOANS FROM GOLDMAN SACHS. IT'S ALL ABOUT REPRESENTING THE GREEDY. HIS WIFE VP AT GOLDMAN SACHS.
@SenTedCruz and the American people should decide their Prez choice by picking the frontrunner in total votes Go Trump! The people's choice.
@SenTedCruz we just can't leave that up to people like u
@SenTedCruz Not you.
@SenTedCruz we already did when we elected President Barack Obama
@SenTedCruz s
@SenTedCruz The American people should pick the President
@SenTedCruz @FitnessViking They already decided by electing Obama 2 terms.
@SenTedCruz Republican Congress should draft list of candidates and submit them to Obama.  Be proactive!
@SenTedCruz We did! When we reelected Obama for second term. Do your job & vote on his nominee.
@SenTedCruz and if she nominates him?
@SenTedCruz I hope Trump gets the nom just 2 get your hypocrical face off of MSM. Another Dem Prez is just a bonus. Kiss SCOTUS bye bye
@SenTedCruz We did! We elected President Obama, twice!
@SenTedCruz Yes they should, AND NOT YOU !!!!!!!!
@SenTedCruz We will by electing Trump!
.@SenTedCruz Even after a democrat wins the next presidential election?
@SenTedCruz Oh you mean by electing a POTUS to his second term and expecting he'll be allowed to perform his duties?  Yeah, we did that!
@SenTedCruz they already have. When they resoundingly elected @BarackObama for a second time. #YouMakeNoSense
@SenTedCruz No, The @POTUS is the one who decides... #headslap
@SenTedCruz Cruz DOES NOT know that the American People Elect a President, Now Cruz Wants 2 be President? Very Scary/ Dangerous
@SenTedCruz The people ALREADY spoke When Obama was Elected President in 2012 Cruz must NOT KNOW that the American people Elect President
@SenTedCruz That's why they voted in my current President. They did not want your party in charge of something this important.
@SenTedCruz We already did.  Republicans are corrupt and racist.
@SenTedCruz they already did. Obama was elected twice by a large majority. You obviously refuse to listen to the public.
@SenTedCruz Hopefully you will not have any input.  You heralded John Roberts as a quick pick & look what we got.
@SenTedCruz Just lost all respect for Cruz and his yellow journalism about Trump's taxes
@SenTedCruz They did. Obama 332, Romney 206.
@SenTedCruz How do you read all these whiners without losing it?  Keep up the good fight. We're with you. #CRUZ2016
@SenTedCruz I placed my vote in 2012.  Stop denying me.  #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz #rechristenchristie
@SenTedCruz 65.9 million Americans decided that @BarackObama should be president for 4 full years, not 3, with full/complete Art.  2 pwrs
@SenTedCruz We did you halfwit. The President is on his 2nd term. You don't like it move back home. Nonserving wimp.
@SenTedCruz I'm for trump so no one yell at me but Cruz is my second I wish they had stayed together. Cruz should be new justice
,@SenTedCruz They will   If Trump wins nom, he will lose to HC or Bernie.  If Trump should win, he will nominate liberal like himself.
@SenTedCruz they already did twice
@SenTedCruz Do you mean the same people who voted for Obama to be president? Do their votes not count?
@SenTedCruz @davidf4444 you're exactly right and the American people will have Trump do it
@SenTedCruz  we didnt get a #autopsy a #Investigation or even a doctors visual of the body. your judgement and silence is suspect .
@SenTedCruz 
Correct me if I am wrong.  ART II, SEC 2 states the President nominates and the Senate says yay/nay.
.@SenTedCruz Exactly. Through their elected president.
@SenTedCruz Yeah! Screw the constitution!
@SenTedCruz WE DID by electing Obama as @POTUS TWICE! Do your damn job.
@SenTedCruz @JLconservative You need to release your sealed records CANADIAN CUBAN CRUZ LIAR & DECEIVER INELIGIBLE! GO TRUMP!
.@SenTedCruz Americans decided that when they voted in Obama. It's a 4 year term. BTW, Trump is right about one thing...u r a major liar!
@SenTedCruz we should also decide if Potus should leave early!
@SenTedCruz Yes, POTUS nominates, and the Senate on behalf of the people that elected them say NO to the Marxist community organizer.
@SenTedCruz The American people did when Obama was elected president twice therefore Obama can nominate an individual.
@SenTedCruz why ain't they in a hurry to convict hillary as they are to replace the justice.
@SenTedCruz We did decide, by electing the POTUS....if you do not know the job description then you should NOT want to be the POTUS
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz yet the constitution leaves that power with the president and senate.  Do your job, please.
@SenTedCruz the American people should have the opportunity to vote on any big decision. No single person knows best.
@SenTedCruz When u mean America should decide how should they decide r u forgetting Iowa, no one trust nothing u say
@SenTedCruz no, the president nominates someone, THEN the senate votes on it. For a prez candidate, you don't seem very well read on this.
.@SenTedCruz The American people decided twice who they want to nominate any Supreme Court Justice between 2009 - 2016, President Obama.
@SenTedCruz They will when Obama's nomination goes through committee and then a (probably fillabustered) vote in the Senate.
@SenTedCruz @DeborahLovesUSA I'm scared to make that deal. They only have a say if you are president ;)
@SenTedCruz Yeah and I want OUR President to decide bc he was elected to do so!!! Stop playing politics!!!!!
@karynashack @SenTedCruz

He wasn't elected to decide. His roll is to nominate and then the Senate is to decide. UCLA huh? Get a refund..
@BradleyKinney I was on scholarship thanks. 
@karynashack

Yeah...sorry for the snark...I probably need a Snickers bar. 
@SenTedCruz they did when they elected Obama TWICE.
@SenTedCruz Reagan nominated a Supreme Court justice less than 14 months before he left office.
@SenTedCruz Just ONE of many reasons that the American People don't care much for you;- - Falito; you fail to follow the Constitution.
@SenTedCruz They DID decide. They voted for Obama... TWICE. #GOPfail
@SenTedCruz, What laws were followed when the Supreme Court handed Bush the presidency over Al Gore??
@SenTedCruz, A conservative Supreme Court is the goal for all conservatives. President Obama will nominate, the senate will block!!
@SenTedCruz The American People did. We voted for President Obama, an office you will NEVER, EVER, have!
@SenTedCruz selective memory on how things work. Right Teddy boy?
@SenTedCruz cheater
@SenTedCruz by 5 million votes in 2012
@SenTedCruz or nawh
@SenTedCruz This argument is waste of time, constitution is clear, Pres nominates, Senate must consider!  Nothing about CONFIRMING ...
@SenTedCruz People did decide, elected Obama twice. President nominates SCOTUS, you can vote against but to hold no hearing is unacceptable.
@SenTedCruz you talk about defending the constitution, it states clearly who can and should nominate. Or is it only when it benefits you?
@SenTedCruz I AGREE WITH YOU
@SenTedCruz better us than you
@SenTedCruz #NVcaucus volunteers are wearing Trump gear (they're not allowed to show preference). (cont) http://tl.gd/nlvaic 
@SenTedCruz We did just that the SECOND time we elected @POTUS Artificially hindering the function of the SCOTUS is bad governance
@SenTedCruz We did, when we elected the President to a 4 year term. Your contempt for democracy and the Constitution is astonishing.
@SenTedCruz guess that leaves you out
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz We need you as a truly Conservative president. The assaults on your character are efforts by men who know they cannot compete.
@SenTedCruz We did when we elected Obama TWICE, Sen. McCarthy.
@PinkwvPink @SenTedCruz That's what I'm talking about 
@SenTedCruz  Is the constitution like your bible Cruz - pick and choose?  If ya don't like something ignore it?
@SenTedCruz Did you forget the last 2 elections, fuckface?
@SenTedCruz if our gop house and senate cant control him we are lost,any thoughts of a recess should be forgotten,watch the store
@SenTedCruz Are you still on this bullshit? Your media team should be fired. #MarketingFails
@SenTedCruz we did. It was called the 2012 election. Stop pretending your stance is anything other than political.
@SenTedCruz yes
@SenTedCruz #youlie Because you dont like who majority of Americans picked to speak for them you just ignore their votes. #GOPDebate  #POTUS
@SenTedCruz American citizens have decided.Elected President Obama!!Twice.Get over it & do your job!Sad example you set for my kids & yours.
@ElizaSay 2012 Senate went Republican w a mandate to STOP Obama. Ever heard of advise & consent?  @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz I did. When I voted for @BarackObama
@SenTedCruz What will we decide is who replaces you.
@SenTedCruz we did, when we voted in the last election
@SenTedCruz Amen!
@SenTedCruz We did. Look it up.
@SenTedCruz The American Decided we wanted President Obama to make that decision in November 2012.
@SenTedCruz  should support @marcorubio for potus, Rubio should appoint @tedcruz to scotus.  No Trump = win/win/win #womenagainsttrump
@SenTedCruz @BrentSnavely that's why they have Presidential elections! Obama won! #electionshaveconsequences
@SenTedCruz "We" did in 2012 for the 2x... And it got us divisiveness, ISIS & San Bernardino !
@SenTedCruz @cmahar3 You're absolutely right, Ted. It just, you know, won't be you. Or anyone else in the GOP #FeelTheBern #HillaryClinton
@SenTedCruz The bad news is, the American people get to decide what happens to you.
@SenTedCruz I thought the President appointed members of the Supreme Court.  Those wanting to be President should not make that choice.
@SenTedCruz SUPREME COURT JUDGES AREN'T ELECTED!! SAYS SO IN THE FUCKING #CONSTITUTION
@SenTedCruz Ted you need to become impeccable with you word. If not, you are being labeled as a liar!
@SenTedCruz You do realize that means a possible Hillary or Bernie appointment
@SenTedCruz They did when they elected the president, that's how it works, and Scalia would have agreed.
@SenTedCruz #NoHearingsNoVotes
@SenTedCruz They did decide, three years ago.
Hey @SenTedCruz, please put a muzzle on the idiot you have running this account. 
#CanadiansForCruz
#Vote4CousinTed 
#WeWinTheyLoseEh
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz not how the constitution works
@SenTedCruz Article II Section 2?
@SenTedCruz I have supported you as a Senator but your Pres Campaign Team has failed you. Integrity, half truths, repeating same fib
Hood,
@SenTedCruz No. It's the responsibility of the President and the Senate. The elections have already been held.
@SenTedCruz Don't give up! Keep lame duck  in a cage until then.
@SenTedCruz 
If God wanted the next President to replace Scalia he would have died next year.
@dingalingy55 @SenTedCruz ha! Yes! This!
@SenTedCruz To say no to a nominee without knowing who he/she is highlights the problem with the current congress. Ridiculous way to govern.
@SenTedCruz Start calling Trump Mr Bankruptcy. If you make a comment about his weird fingers, he'd flip out.
@SenTedCruz Right, the very same people who will decide on your pending demise.
@SenTedCruz The American people were not elected to do this job; Congress was!
@SenTedCruz they did in the 2012 presidential election. What don't you understand about POTUS? I don't believe you are qualified. #ignorant
@SenTedCruz That's a terrifying thought. The American public seems to be assholes.
@SenTedCruz I feel if the tables were turned and a GOP president was in power, you would be saying the opposite thing though?
@SenTedCruz They did, they elected a president.
@SenTedCruz we can't leave it up to these idiots. If they'll vote for DJT or HRC they don't need to decide. Just you as POTUS.
@SenTedCruz They did - in the 2012 presidential election
@SenTedCruz you mean like when the elected @BarackObama .....twice?
@SenTedCruz  #constitution says OTHERWISE.  DO YOUR JOB!!! #useless  #GOP #Republican
@SenTedCruz Which will be decided in this presidential election. Dems win they choose. Repubs win they choose
.@SenTedCruz We have done. We chose President Obama. #SCOTUS
@SenTedCruz My vote for our president (twice) should be counted, no? What you really mean is only far-right wing folks should decide.
@SenTedCruz they already did when @POTUS was elected.
@SenTedCruz if that were true we would get to vote on it but that's not how it works cruz get your facts straight Trump 2016
@SenTedCruz No
@SenTedCruz you mean like they did in 2012?  Get a fucking clue.
@SenTedCruz Just do not get this line of thinking, you do not HAVE to confirm, but you do HAVE to #DoYourJob #OGrady2016 #Wethepeople
@SenTedCruz Go away
@SenTedCruz hey mr constitution! you should read it! we have a current pres and it is his job to nominate! god told me you should go home!
@SenTedCruz You are a Senator sometimes, right? Is that what the Constitution says? The American people or the Senate? Do your job & vote!
@SenTedCruz Of course,  because you revere the Constitution. We decided in 2012 that we wanted Obama to make those decisions until 1/20/17.
@rstackjr @SenTedCruz that's notwhat you vote for when voting for president.
@sudranski @SenTedCruz Um,  that's one reason I voted Obama. If you are too short sighted to see that it's not my problem.
@rstackjr @SenTedCruz you never read the constitution. You didn't vote Obama to be your president, you voted him to be your dictator.
@sudranski @SenTedCruz When is he going to dissolve Congress and establish Sharia Law? I'm getting impatient and he's running out of time.
@rstackjr @SenTedCruz you're  joking
@sudranski @SenTedCruz Am I? Perhaps to illustrate how ridiculous your statement is regarding Obama being a dictator?
@rstackjr @SenTedCruz there was no illustration whatsoever. Obama has behavedas a dictator would. Read the constitution.
@SenTedCruz & are furious now. Obama only won bcuz angry Conservative voters stayed home rather than vote 4 another Moderate.
@SenTedCruz They did, in 2012! #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz  and voted in a GOP senate in 2014.
