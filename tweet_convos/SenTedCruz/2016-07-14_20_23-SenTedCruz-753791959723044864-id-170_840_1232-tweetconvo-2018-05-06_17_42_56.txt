@SoniaPennell Come back Mr Cruz and fly the Conservative Flag.
Hi Please endorse Trump it's your duty as a Republican as a Christian and for God as God sent Trump to save us all aAmerica.
So how come a GOP Congress never brought up articles of impeachment? Clearly BHO is not playing w/a full deck. IMO
@SenTedCruz
Don't lie & fake like UR concerned 4 the country! U have helped Hillary every step of the way! Guess what? You LOST! Support DT!
Is that why the GOP reduced funding for embassy security and similar actions? #GOPTakeResponsibility
Need to see politicians and gov official go to jail for treason !
please go away.... You are embarrassing yourself and your party
why r u going against your party then! Disgraceful!
.@SenTedCruz @SchadeTom It is a policy if your agenda is to pretend it doesn't exist
Then tell Americans your upset at what @realDonaldTrump said - then endorse him and unite the party. Earn the respect of us all.
@SoBeCruzGirl like a child, deny it, so its not true.
@tweet4upatriots
You'd have to be blind not to see his denial is willful.
please demand that your candidate release his taxes!
and by not supporting Trump you will cast Hillary on us. Thanks a bunch. Not!
when is Congress (That's u Ted) going to pass an AUMF? One tongue fork blocking POTUS, other fork blaming POTUS #CruzDoubleSpeak
He's done nothing of the sort! His Coalition & our Heavy Bombing; forcing ISIS to give up the idea establishing Caliphate!
Only 2 candidates from 2 parties are in the running.Who's side R U on? Better party with dems from here out. Ur their new bestie
You spend time on your vanitry. Not Christian. You are a sore loser and dont look for my vote in future.
no honor Ted..shameful.
For the people my ass. Here's your girl
willful blindness was part of your campaign strategy
George Soros is funding domestic violence against America ! List him as a terrorist Organization .
Seven years?  That would earn U a Bull Shit!  ISIS didn't move into the Region until 2014.  Most didn't know who they were!
ISIS Leadership still embroiled in a Power Struggle with A'Q, in 2011 & 2012. Cruz; U are smarter than that!  Sloppy Work!
A few days before the convention.
1 night of you sealed your fate at the Convention no one gives a damn about you you will be lucky to keep your job as Senator
didn't know u were a gambling man. Gambled your political career away last night at RNC. U r a snake! We won't forget! EVER!
Just ask Bin Laden
yeah, well let's see the Republican Party explain that plagiarized speech that @realDonaldTrump wife made yesterday? Very sad!!
@AwakeDeborah Please Senator unsuspend your campaign for the sake of America! The GOP isn't worth saving! Third party please 
Did you discuss this with him as he gave you a lift on Air Force 1 to Dallas? @sentedcruz
you do realize it was Bush's war that destabilized the middle east? Btw, stop bashing Obama he's only got 6 months left
Ted, we have a Muslim in the WH
#LYINGTED why have u refused to endorse #Trump??? U R supporting ISIS/HRC by not doing so! 

#Trump2016 #TrumpPence
Seven years? I don't think so! Habit of under - - and - - over-stating facts to firm your biased Opinion?
The Ole' Carpet Bomber back again. ISIS being pushed out of M/E; now aiming to fight a,"hit & ruin," Guerrilla type War. abroad!
@SpeakerRyan #SecureTheBorder #NoRefugees #DestroyISIS #StopIranDeal #BalancedBudget #AbolishIRS @DANEgerus @#FireMcConnell !
LYING TED. ESTAS DE PINGA! Disgrace to our Cuban-American ppl! BACK THE CANDIDATE RIGHT??? Sucka!!
@GinaGWeiss Again I ask you: snce when is giving aid & comfort to the enemy NOT Treason?Obama's been doing this & u have proof!
#CongressDoYourJob #Impeach and #ArrestObama for #treason. We the people and your #OathOfOffice demand it.  
rinos in control of senate and house don't do shit to stop him
ISIS SAID A FEW YEARS BACK THEY WOULD FLY THERE FLAG ON TOP THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY ON THE WAY.
stop Muslim immigration,immediately send non-Muslim citizens back, then work to peaceably strip citizenship of Muslims & deport
I agree
He doesn't deny it. Don't be a fool.
Time To Call The Senate Sergeant At Arms #NOW
@vjeannek No Ted it's not a policy but an agenda! Congress needs to stop this evil man
How abt him arming the enemy? Lets call it what it is: TREASON! Now what r u and Congress going to do abt it?
amen!
< @BarackObama
No wonder your colleagues despise you.
not every tragedy is fodder for political ad. Show some respect. Jesus, you are horrible.
You are embarrassment to the state of Texas & to your office. Shameless opportunist. Vomit inspiring!
let's start another expensive war
IT'S RIDICULOUS
@SenTedCruz
I believe O asked Congress for a declaration of war and you hard workers said No. So, it's more like: 7 years of obstructionism.
Obama'll never get that regardless of weapons used radical islamic terrorists want to destroy our way of life. it's that simple
republicans expel much hot air but refuse to #DoYourJob ! #Coward #Shameful #Hypocrisy
did congress grant Obama a new declaration of force? No, republicans refused to even hold discussion.
I don't think it's 'willful blindness'.  I think Barack Obama really does secretly support the terrorists.
thank you Ted Cruz for speaking the truth.  You are my President
It is getting worse because they are getting desperate because they are being defeated.  Obamas policy is working
Stupid is as stupid does - Obama
dang it Ted.....well stay the course sir. You WILL be our president. Thank you for speaking at Convention. We / HE needs you.
Mr Cruz why wont you openly help trump? Put politics aside! This is for our nation! Please!
WHEN is #Christian West going to admit #RadicalIslamicTerrorist are on another #Muslim #CRUSADE? #Obama denial equals death:-(
0bama the king of(LSD)liberal socialist de moc rat party&supporters n media,enabled him & hillary(i can only tell a lie)clinton!
@Phoenix2a1
Agree....now it's time for you and the rest of the GOP to come together and stop HRC!
Constant criticism without offering concrete policy differences isn't a strategy either.
then you and ALL your supporters need to unite with Trump NOW to make sure Hillary gets shut out big time.
@insurancegrrl I think one of the Tweeters said it best. (paraphrasing) willful blindness is borderline treason. Ooh the T word.
Obama didn't know what declaring war meant.
You're in the goddam Senate. Do you understand what it means?
only shows on TV except Science Fiction likable. Sure tax will increase due to war. Obama did not jihad it 7years!
Seemed like bush never had an issue with willful blindness. #warcrimes #abughraib
... Either is willful bullshit
We all know this, Senator,  we've been waiting for Congress to throw Obama out of office. U seem to be afraid of an empty suit
Willful blindness is just a euphamism for stupidity or worse...treason.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP 
What do you want to do?
Send a million US soldiers to die there?

Or call out a magic phrase?
Everything is worse after Obama! We need you, Sir!
Willful ignorance is your raison d'etre. The RNC and state Republican party platforms defined. You = policy of willful blindness
@MariellenTilden 
Get on the #TrumpTrain
#MAGA
aaaaand it begins. expect all dimwit @GOP to chime in and blame @POTUS for an attack on foreign soil. #Idiots
Looks like the strategy of loving them to death is not working.
Ted COME OUT AND SUPPORT Trump!!! We need this win boss and if you do u could be the NEXT PRESIDENT!!!! Republicans for 16yrs!!!
U& your soldier idiots were trying to steal nomination while #Trump talked world events! How pathetic you all have turned out 2B
I personally think Obama doesn't care along with his democrat cronies. Send BO, L Lynch, J Kerry to give terrorist a hug
@aaron_bogue Oh do shut up. Your "solution" was gung-ho boots on the ground bullshit, putting more US lives at risk.
Yep. #Gop not rallying behind nominee going to get us killed. U, @SpeakerRyan, @Reince get others rally. If HRC wins on y'all
knock it off and DO SOMETHING YOURSELF!
it's Israel's fault, the world is intentionally being destroyed for the greater Israel pipelines. I see right threw you Mason!
we feel the same way about mass shootings in the US
In maritime law, hostis humani generis, the enemy of humanity...
impeach Obama!!!
@SenTedCruz
just endorse already.
Ted wants his holy war.
its called complicit.
is the one that has a plan and is ready to take the lead. If people don't listen, let them "hang" themselves, and you will win!
Making politics over still warm dead body? You should be ashamed of yourself!!!
If POTUS could get the terrorists to accept Gender Neutral bathrooms I'm sure the terrorism would cease.
All Republicans and others need to unite behind Trump. Our national safety is more important than politics!
7 1/2 years of blaming Bush are transitioning into 6 months of blaming Trump, what leader has EVER lacked that much character?

@SenTedCruz
no wonder you don't tweet much
Cowardice always catches up to you. #OBAMA's pride is as high as the heavens. He will never admit his 'strategy' is wrong.
But it is not just Obama.  Where is the rest of the world?
How have you come the fact that your inability to legislate here affects those in France? #AtlanticOcean #BetterCheckYourFacts
Just admit you're the zodiac killer
Blindness? Almost daily our fighter pilots risk getting shot down by ISIS from the 1000's of bombing operations we've had.
#President #Obama needs to immediately call for #TruckControl or stop calling for #GunControlNow! #France #Nice #TerrorAttack
0bama's policy: hear no Islam evil, see no Islam evil, speak in defense of Islam evils. (Distract, change subject, blame others)
fuck has been, sorry, #neverwas
How's that policy of yours working for ya?
http://www.cjr.org/the_second_opinion/pro_publica_workers_comp.php â€¦
is reckless. You offer no solutions -- only blame. #recklessted
Time for Congress to declare war on ISIS and allow our military to do whatever is necessary to defeat the enemy. #PrayForNice
more " extremely careless " behavior.? Bull shot. BLOOD on their hands more likely.
yet the GOP did nothing but sit on their hands
willful blindness is a policy... I beg to differ. It is an overt policy to destroy from within; his plan from the beginning.
BHO our POTUS has a new title "Monitor in Chief"--- he just monitors the problem but does not fix it or attempt to.
pls support Trump as he works to make our country safe and united again
@POTUS ' s religion of peace at it again i see
@SenTedCruz
Killing these people you think there going go lay down n sleep ....How quick u guys blame everyone else
Sad but True
Then why aren't you endorsing the nominee? Or do you opt for securing continuation of Obama by helping elect Hillary
IT WOULD B GREAT IF U TALKED ABOUT THIS AT THE CONVENTION. IT'S THE ONE THING U AND DONALD HAVE IN COMMON.
. BHO IS Muslim and he is doing all he can to promote civilization jihad. It seems so far fetched we can't believe our eyes!
willful ignorance. Blindness is too kind.
And 4 more years of it getting worse has been assured. I am so angry right now.
But surely a trip by @JohnKerry and @JamesTaylor_com would make things better.
it's because they fear no retaliation from our administration after each attack we all "stand in unity" that's it, stand around.
You failed to pass AUMF against Daesh, sir. Don't blame Obama.
this is more than worse. This is a disaster
that didn't take long.
it is when the media is on his side.
the Religion of Peace strikes again! Let's prohibit the trucks in the World!  Thanks for fighting for America! @BarackObama
oh crap THAT'S funny! Spot on my friend...
blindness is a policy, of this administration.
Denying? He's supporting it!
@SenTedCruz
1.He's retreated from the Mexico border 2.He's importing Syrian terrorists who've already murdered US Citizens! 

@SenTedCruz
you suck and do nothing positive for this nation
TRUMP
