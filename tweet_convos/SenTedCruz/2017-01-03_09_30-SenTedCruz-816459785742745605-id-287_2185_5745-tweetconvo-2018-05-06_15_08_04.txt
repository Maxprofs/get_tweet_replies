USA thinks you are a clown dictator who clearly doesn't want peace. Kill them all BB! Children first.
Their right to defend does not extend to a right to terrorize and kill children. God condemns Israel.
The Jews were annihilated by Germans not ONCE have they retaliated. We don't need screaming Arabs teaching hate @netanyahu
Not German children, Arab children. Sorry I was not clear. God condemns and curses Israel.
Israel targets innocent Arab children. God knows what Israel is doing and condemns them
Those "innocent " Arab children r the next generation of Jihadis. Raised in bitterness & hate. @netanyahu

are you referring to the way as Jesus Christ?
Yeshua is called, the everlasting Father, the almighty God, who was crucified Isaiah 9:6:7.
Jesus is God in the flesh father son Holy Spirit the trinity 3 in 1 all co- equal
Israel's rights in Judea is not in question, the question is Israel's Manifest Destiny, why negotiate with Palestine, to what end
Peace!
through overwhelmingly superior strength and unbridled unobstructed resolve!
And determination to steal from and kill little children. Gas them J. L. They have no right to breath.
violence must be challenged with superior violence, killing is not welcomed, it's required to survive as a people
@irenerusso124 They are very deep Sir, all the way to GOD!
@PcExtremist @netanyahu @trbrad62 
Help me understand how fascist inspired folk support Israel who got exterminated?
Help me understand just what your purpose in life might be.
Thank you, but was talking to the troll. 
Seriously can't you explain? How can Israel accept fascist support? 6M lives destroyed
Who are you calling fascists?
People who discriminated others negatively-imagine racial superiority that sort of stuff
CORRUPT!
@the626killa A prayer for strength!

a. please show proof of this in the talmud. B. Followers of what leader are most opposed to jesus?
if I'm not mistaken Jesus's was born after the Talmud times.
@GaetaSusan Was never in doubt.
Antichrist is here
Israel is God's chosen people. The apple of His eye. God will curse those who curse Israel and bless those who bless Israel.
You'd swear it was written in Polish!!!
Hahahhaahha

DAMN I LIKE TO HEAR THIS KINDA STUFF.
Still waiting for Palestinian scribblings on something 2000 years old. Not even in the Quran.
@diana_west_  It is now fashionable to elevate the Arab at the expense of the Jew. Imbeciles here - pick your fights carefully.
@TN_SmartGirl wow thank you for sharing.
.@netanyahu any geologists on this dig ????
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @BarackObama @dnc #antisemetic
@SenTedCruz long before the invention of the fake Palestinian's
it's the funniest joke I've ever heard so Germans can come back to Iran and say we have roots here
@UN WHAT PROOF DO THE squattingArabs have that they were the first 2inhabitant TheLandOfMilk&Honey? ISRAEL TheAppleOfGod'sEye!
also your roots are nourished by the blood of palestinian genocide!
frauds.
All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God. PS 98 @netanyahu @tedcruz
During Chanukah, Israeli spelunkers in an ancient Judean cistern discovered 2,000 year-old engraving of a menorah. Our roots here are deep! 
You are a GREAT MAN! THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRENGTH!!

So what, jews rules, jews forever. I missed your point here.All I got: Jewish ppl will never be humble. and keep proving that plz
ninguém pode negar a raiz histórica que Israel tem com sua própria terra. Não sou judeu! Mas não sou louco de negar a verdade.
Beautiful! God is good all the time! 
Beautiful . No one can deny this proof.
Deeper roots than many other acknowledged nations. #UnitedNations
What a great find. Sounds like a miracle happened again during this time of year.
no one in the ancient world was white. The 12 tribes were colored. Not people who joined the faith but the Hebrew race
not white
khazars are not the hebrews
they were black not white
and you (jews) were driven from palestine. for what you did to moses.
I am for Israel !  I am a CUFI member!  I support Israel !

@SenTedCruz 2,000 years ago? I've got a book here that reliably says your people were there a couple thousand years before that.
@erotao God destroyed Palestina around 3,000 years ago.  Yes, the land belongs to the Jewish people. It's in the Book of God.
@KimberleeHicks3 2000 years old?  It must be a younger version!
@BL_Abba You're from Poland Milekowsky 
You need not present evidence of this.There s an active Contingen of US will report to UR  service a moments notice
@IsraeliPM @TeamTrump @Nigel_Farage Nobody better vote 14-0 against Israel in UN or Anywhere else again! Who stood up 4 Israel?!!
@tedcruz your claim U have gone 2 such extremes ie settlements 2 take hold over what IS the Palestinians that U R not 2 B trusted
@SenTedCruz 
@tedcruz selfish & would never give them the opportunity. Has an independent anthropologist certified your find, or is this just
@tedcruz If U gave the Palestinians a chance 2even look 4 pieces of their heritage, I'm sure they'd find the same. But you're
@tedcruz SHUT THE F*** UP! There R deep roots 4 the Palestinians as well. U cannot use an artifact to claim your roots R stronger
God, Jehovah has Michael the Arch-Angel as your Protector. The only country in the world that has one. Amen!
The God of Israel and the creator of the universe is with you
Ok cool. In that case kill away. If you get bored remember you only have a couple weeks left to undermine our president.
so deep as the jewish ash in sovivor
@SenTedCruz amazing! I would like to dig in your country. I am particularly interested in your ethnobotany/pharmacognosy.
the land belongs to Israel. #GodblessIsrael #PrayforthepeaceofJerusalem #IstandwithIsrael
@SenTedCruz so are your debts to the USA!!!
@SenTedCruz fascinating & joyful...
@SenTedCruz this gross man use anything to justify his apartheid state
@SenTedCruz 
Very deep. And that's why I Stand with you and Israel. Keep fighting the good fight Mr. PM.
awesome!
The world's roots there are deep. Please don't imply they are exclusively Jewishly deep.
Yes who cares! Your roots are covered in blood.
@MONTESQUIEU1956 What a beautiful reminder of the hand of The LORD upon Israel.
@SenTedCruz #lyingTed #Netanyahu perfect together both call for bloodshed and killing innocent  ppl
So awesome!!!
Judea? Sumeria? We live in 21st century man. Deal with it.

Mark 4:22

G d bless Israel & The United States of America.
That is so cool!!!!  And found during Chanukah, when Chanukah and Christmas are at the same time. Very Jehovah, wouldn't you say?
America loves you. <3
pray Bibi, like Hezekiah. Knees have power to change.
Deep and Eternal.
I'm still trying to figure out how Solomon managed to slip the foundation to his Temple under the Dome of the Rock!
so never give up the land. But you cannot rely on human strength. Trust The ONE who divided the land to the people of Israel.
Praise Adonai!!
fabulous!!
That is awesome! Israel is truly blessed.
@tedcruz yeah, sure it's not political.
Religion leads to war & divide jews & muslims for hundreds of years. Get rid of the religions & bring down divide
get rid of the muslims. jews can live with others, muslims cannot
Keep people get rid of all religion thus end 1000s yrs war over factually proven religious lies, no more band aid
Great find. Time to make Israel  the second greatest country in the world after the USA 
. Phoenician caaninite language is impressive as well
PM, Americans love #Israel, God's chosen people, and you. 
Beware of those who want to divide God's land. 
We pray for Jerusalem
#Not going anywhere, not moving, staying put here is to the  #UN
AMEN¡
@heatherj750 It's amazing to see what is finally found.Imagine what's under all the sands in the deserts. #ancientworlds

@HeimishCon had no odea the Occupation was so old! #Palestine
Well the Clintons  shadow govt want to overthrow Israel & kill @realDonaldTrump  same time
@Lrihendry  Quran written 600+ years after Christ.
I'm all for Israel claiming its entirety of Holy Land God originally bestowed. Lebanon to Egypt, into Iraq, Syria and Jordan.
The Lord bless you and keep you; make his face shine on you & be gracious to you; turn his face toward you & give you peace.
