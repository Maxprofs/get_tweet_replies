@SenTedCruz @rjoy1919 bush cartel used Reagan presidency to escalate war on drugs and take out its competitors "just say no"
@SenTedCruz @InezFeltscher quit it shameless pandering. You have no right to claim carrying the mantle of Reagan. you stand for yourself.
@jlcawood you're a sick person if this is your response to someone paying their respects. #bye
@InezFeltscher Pardon me for being entirely skeptical of anything Cruz says. We may disagree, but Cruz linking himself to Reagan is fantasy
@jlcawood Funny, I didn't see any pandering or "mantle" claiming in that. @InezFeltscher
@MaconLetisTmato True, I was referring to his eager readiness to compare himself to Reagan during campaign
@jlcawood @dcexaminer that's fair enough, but the response to his tweet wasn't. But hey, I'm not exactly pure either.
@MaconLetisTmato @dcexaminer I concede the placement of my tweet seems to incite disrespect to Nancy. not my intention. Good evening to you.
@SenTedCruz Obama does not care and missed her funeral. He's so disrespectful. Glad your not Ted.
@SenTedCruz Ronald Reagan would not be able to support a naturalized citizen like Cruz. Reagan believes in and follows the constitution.
@SenTedCruz Ah, yes. A woman with enough sense to advocate stem cell research to find solutions to problems of health. Agree with her?
@SenTedCruz

#NancyReagan practiced w/ her witch who read her future. #PredictionsDaily before leaving WH

@SenTedCruz he would have despised you and you know it
@SenTedCruz 
You sir are no Ronald Reagan it's blasphemy for you to compare yourself 
to him
@SenTedCruz Remember, reagan inherited a nation in 1981, not yet bankrupted by 34 years of reaganomics!

@SenTedCruz And how both of them chose to let 1000s of people die from AIDS, including their friends, because they were ignorant homophobes.
@SenTedCruz you bad mouth Obama but Romney wishes he could be half the man Mitt can go to church everyday of the week but he's still a devil
@SenTedCruz Reagan would have supported Trump. You  act like a used car salesperson What lot r u working on this week?
@SenTedCruz cruz will drop out after losing az, he'll tell you its to unite the party, he'll support trump, he might be vp
@SenTedCruz Reagan respected his marriage. true to Nancy Cruz five affairs against wife, like bill Clinton ted very dishonest
@SenTedCruz For now, @HillaryClinton has my vote. But, you have my vote as well (for now). 

#ConfusedInMI

@SenTedCruz @winterfalls25 beautiful woman
@SenTedCruz @hearmyvoiceapp Ronald Reagan was dimwit had no passion for middle class & poor and certainly none for air traffic controllers
@SenTedCruz will be missed
@SenTedCruz Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let Perpetual Light Shine upon her.  May her soul rest in peace. Amen.

@SenTedCruz frankly I can't believe some of the subhuman trash talk on Twitter about Nancy and Ronald Reagan after her passing. Truly sad.
@SenTedCruz she was pure class.
@SenTedCruz too bad you put them in the wrong order
@SenTedCruz Ms. REAGAN would unite the party; get the House in order; forbid personal bashing, and wear warm colors. Get to work.
