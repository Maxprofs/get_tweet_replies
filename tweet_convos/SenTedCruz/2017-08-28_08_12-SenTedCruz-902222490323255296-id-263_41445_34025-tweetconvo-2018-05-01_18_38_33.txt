This woman was rescued yesterday
So glad!!! Thanks for letting me know! Let's still get the word out about the towels...
Absolutely! There's still plenty of people waiting unfortunately
What about Joel Osteens Mega Church?..Its not open???..People need shelter for God's Sake!!!
No, apparently he won't let people in.
If he were a true Christian he would offered help right away but says that he will open the church doors once other buildings are full
Suffering and dying and he and those that sit in lofty places with him do nothing..he needs to be run out of Houston.

How about instead of being snarky you help us. You can text Harvey to 90999 to donate $10. To Red Cross. Thanks.
You seem angry.
Oh I'm angry all right! trump comes here today and makes asinine comments to people who have lost everything. I meant you seem angry at me

Someone please tell the White House staff that was meant for Houston.
Stay safe guys we are praying for you from Australia
Hope everyone is safe. Love you all from 
I want help people. Where should I go?
Also charge your phone and/or plug in your un-submerged computers and tablets and check Twitter periodically (so you know to hang the sheet)
Did hear on news today. August 29th that Pastor. Olsten would open church in after noon
Why was their not an evacuation plan? You had a weeks notice! What a travesty for so many Texans!!
Thinking and praying for all in texas
Please share this interactive map of people needing help if you are assisting in rescues.
Where is the Jesus pedalar @JoelOsteen  with his megachurch and words of bullshit to help  the many people he make money off of every week?
@baetheist69 is wearing a white sheet and carrying a rebel flag
Stay safe everybody
They still have wi-fi/data?
Heard search crews are going door 2 door. Future disaster preparedness should teach ways to quickly mark homes as empty so time isn't wasted
This should have been posted ahead of storm. If it was I missed it. because I'm guessing people now do not have Internet access
Thank you for protecting and serving.
@EricHolthaus #harvey #hounews I'm not official, just a thought: addresses hard to find in flood, but EMS can prob use coords 1/2
#harvey #hounews If you can, go to Google maps, find your house. Address bar shows Lat/Lon. Use it if you call.
How are voluntary evacuations determined?  I was just wondering how deep the surrounding water has to be before one should evacuate?
#mumbairains do the same?
@JulieBanderas i can see how the people barbecuing on the roof can confuse you.
Maybe you can explain why law enforcement is listening to a Mayor who gave insane 'stay put' instructions?  

A death sentence for some...
Borrowed from hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
Why not leave when evacuation order is given?
;) ;)
& America y'all need to save hispanics w/o threat of deportations..
my friend @adam_lund needs help. 6 of them and 2 dogs. harris county / friendswood
Address numbers should be lit up
#ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #NeverthelessShePersisted #GuantanamoforTrump #EVIL  @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski  @nytimes @WSJ
Please Listen Cz That worked during Katrina!
Any planned evacuations in Baytown/Mont Belvieu areas? Haven't heard anything!! Calling 911 hasn't been helpful at all! Thank you!
Please don’t call 911 for that purpose. Call (281) 420-5311 or tweet the city of Baytown. @CityofBaytown

Retweet the helpful numbers

People also can use a reflectors from cars stop-signals, I think. In the dark. If you have lights.
Prayers.
If they need translation, call our language hotline (844)561-4888 to talk to an interpreter or email Ladon.Team@gmail.com. Let us help!
How many folks are still stranded? What is the death toll?
Thank you!!
You know, when hitchhikers guide said you could use your towel as a distress signal, I thought it was a joke
The idea that someone who has their towel is so together normal people will give them other items has definitely helped in SE situations
Yes but a lot of them old and can not put towels then what, forget them
Rescuers pls remove the towel or sheet after job done so as not to mislead other rescuers. Thanks much
If they have smart phones, they can find/send their GPS coordinates
;)
There are several posts on #HoustonStrong  please help them. God Bless you all. Stay strong ♡ From #NovaScotia #Canada

#EMERGENCY 30 dogs & cats remain trapped at 413 Speights Loop Road

Please help pets too!
God bless you all!

#FLASH - if you are stranded in #Houston or surrounding here's a list of private boat and high water vehicle owners willing to evacuate you. 
This is the best idea. Ask others to retweet this info.
DON'T NEED NOR WANT ANY HELP!
Yikes, this is a difficult issue
@missmayim Also, if you're on Twitter while you're flooded, maybe your priorities need re-adjusting 
No, not at all. Desperation to save their own lives & others has no protocol.keep your comment to yourself, if you have nothing nice to say.

IMPORTANT: If you are awaiting rescue, hang a towel or sheet prominently so we can find you. Adresses are hard to spot. #harvey #hounews
Wow So Crazy Please Lord Be With These People in this situation
Does this work for taxpayers on Obamacare?  i will raise the sheet and ready for Obamacare rescue!
Ggg:, SE X, x

Have ICE check their status  many illegal aliens in that area
May God be with all those in Texas, their loved ones around the country that are worried, and those seeking to help and save.
Sending prayers to everyone
That's assuming anyone can find such things >< God bless and good luck out ther!
Use shirts or whatever you can get I guess!
Some please help @khou
Knowing Texas..it will be the hood or robe.
People should not be putting their trash out till the rain has stopped & water has receded.The trash will wind up blocking our water drains
God bless you all

Y'ALL I WENT TO HS WITH HER. THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HELP SINCE YESTERDAY. FAMILY OF 6 AND THEY HAVE A BABY! PLEASE RT! #HurricaneHarvey 
#CajunNavy
Shared this..Make a frame where it stands up and can be seen from air and ground
Thats A GREAT idea!!
How many people can fit in Joel Osteen's place? I'm sure he'd be happy to cloth, feed, and house everyone.
A lot
Geographic locations don't change, use your GPS. Maybe more precise?
@iamNicoleKay
...can b spotted from the street or a drone. 
Another idea besides mandatory roof exits, a pole with an SOS flag that ppl can run up n times of emergencies like the flooding that can...
Pass this along. Praying for Texas
Of course, if you had listened to your governor instead of your f*ckwad mayor you would have evacuated and wouldn't need rescuing now!!!!
Ali
ITS NOT FLUSHING QUEENS!!
ITS COLLEGE POINT!!!!
DID YOU HAVE A ROUGH WEEKEND ?
I am drowning of sorts. Am definitely waving the White Flag for some more clues?
Where are you? What's your location? How many people are with you?
Hopefully rescue has Google maps on their cellphones to navigate.
@MackenzieeNP for your friends!
Is the sheet a sign for Trump to show a fellow KKK member needs help when he flies over?
Addresses*
@marc_federico I know you're already out but if you have friends who aren't!!

God bless youGod bless America God bless our Republic
C'mon Americans let's GIVE generously #Texas 
Are you all coming to Bavaria Town homes?  Plz help!

#HarveySOS
And, remember to take it down when you are safe!
Google Map the address and leave it on the DEFAULT VIEW.  It should give you an image of at least the  general area you are looking for
It maybe late for some but, a blue tarp stands out best to rescuers. Nail it to the roof. Remember the EMS are dealing with thousands
Y'all have so many ideas-You need a comprehensive list of things/uses to permanently pack for hurricanes-distribute it widely! Prepper4Gulf!

It sound like#fun
If y'all can grab sheets towels of bright colors so they are more visible  if it's raining. Stuck but safe in Houston myself.
Ted said we couldn't afford to help Hurricane Sandy Victims..but now he's here to help?
Voted NO on $23B instead of $4.9B for Dams and Locks
Please help them https://twitter.com/xojaynedo/status/902235400525242368 …

Omg please let the rain stop... I don't live there any more but still my TOWN!!!! Born there!!! Makes me sick. Praying for y'all.
This is such great news... now... not before the storm hit. Bet you fail to mention this before the next storm. You're idiots.
PLEASE everyone, go to https://usngapp.org  just one time and you can use it in the future w no net connection to let 911 know your loc!
How does it work? I opened it up to share to FB & it does not state anything.
When you open http://usngapp.org  you should see something like this:
@SydneyA
i got only my underwear to hang, if you found me would you arrest me for nudity ??
YES HANG THOSE TOWELS OUT SO THEY CAN SEE YOU BUT REMEMBER YOUR SITUATION AND HOW BAD IT IS AND TED CRUZ VOTED AGAINST SANDY VICTIMS
Good idea!
Please help my friend!! https://twitter.com/KnowledgIsPowa/status/902109672529940480 …
