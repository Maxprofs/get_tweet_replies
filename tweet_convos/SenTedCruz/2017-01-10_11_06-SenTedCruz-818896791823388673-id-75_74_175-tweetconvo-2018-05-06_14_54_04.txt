Confirmation Hearing for Attorney General Nominee Sen. Jeff #Sessions resumes – LIVE on C-SPAN3 http://cs.pn/2jA1RxP  #SessionsHearing 
@cspan WOW!
. You just cleaned dems clock & showed how they covered up for Obama. Way to go!
You hit it Out of the park! 100% we are with you & @SenatorSessions #Sessionshearing  You both make me proud of our Constitution
@cspan you made me very proud..amazing job today Senator
your "speech" was pathetic, but not unexpected
@cspan Thank you for standing with Senator Sessions against the lies of the left!Mocking HisGrandaughter
Ahh Those Tolerant Liberals It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth.
Thank you for reminding us about all the "scandal-free" issues the Holder/Obama team was involved in.Excellent opening statement
It's almost like watching dirty, gross porn. Take ur lips off his ass! sessions & cruz are 1 in the same racist/bigot/deplorable
Hey @Jillymoe wipe that Dirty Sanchez off your lip
LYING TED AT IT AGAIN DISGUSTING KOCHSUCKER .
Must be a trumper, same rhetoric.....
@cspan What you just did is exactly why YOU are not pres. elect. Thank God! and why you are not in Sessions seat!
What did he do so wrong? He spoke the truth.
Took thewhole time to feed his ego.  Sessions is doing great. Doesn't need help from an almost pres/AG elect
pathetick small minds how sad
@cspan I think I'll close my eyes and pray for a good outcome instead.
A great American you are, god save the Republic.
Why?  Are you going to protect us and stand up to dt's puppet? Or wait until he can use the IRS to punish his "enemies"?
Sessions is totally unqualified to be our next AG. He is an anti-everything bigot w/a horrible record. #StopSessions
@cspan ...should be heading w/respect to legal issues. Sessions is. NOT. QUALIFIED.
@cspan ...Sessions is a lesser legal mind whose positions put him radically opposite 2 the direction the country feels it...
@cspan...Sessions is wrong re:immigration reform, civil forfeiture, LGBTQ & women's rts, & orgs that dissent like ACLU & NAACP..
@cspan Now is the time 4 liberty loving Americans 2 stand up 2 dark side of this election. Sessions is wrong re: war on drugs...
@cspan I watched for a while its basically democrats berating him for not supporting their past bills.
Tec came across as a pompous lying scumbag only interested in himself. As usual.
@cspan VOTE NO.  Please!
