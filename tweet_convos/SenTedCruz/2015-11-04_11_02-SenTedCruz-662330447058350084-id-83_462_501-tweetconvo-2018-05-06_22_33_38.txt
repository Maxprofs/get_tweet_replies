@thehill @mlong42947 Cruz takes $$ from CFG, a pro-amnesty group. He's usual flame throwing to get attention.
@sampedj @mlong42947 What pro amnesty group? If you're going to put info out there, give the source.
@thehill @ProudInfidel33 @WITHDRAWN2 SMELLS LIKE HARRY REID TO ME"

Dear @thehill , the law was for convicted criminal illegal alien felons. Try using English language.
@thehill @izzysroses   a bit late.. don't you agree ??
@thehill @PatriotJewel Democratic law makers should  be ashamed of themselves. They could care less about American citizens
@thehill Do you refer to rapists as "undocumented sex partners"?
@thehill @tedcruz Dems are idiots and care only about lining their pockets with tax payer dollars TRUMP 2016!!!!!
@thehill @SenTedCruz Who cares, you want to increase immigration two fold and visas by 500%. Why give more of our jobs to foreigners ?

@thehill @FreedomChild3 They're ILLEGAL ALIENS, there's no such thing as an Undocumented Immigrant, Immigration is a LEGAL PROCESS. PERIOD.
@thehill @tedcruz What about tougher penalties for tax cheats? Oh wait, you want to abolish the IRS.
@thehill @t2gunner Cruz 2016
@thehill @ChuckNellis you have the majority now use it...
@thehill just follow the Constitution and don't bend rules for anyone or party. That's how you do the job correctly!
@thehill What happened to enforcement of American laws (all) don't all elected and appointed officials take an oath ? Future Park Cruz will.
@thehill President  Cruz will
@TaraHill5 @thehill @SenTedCruz Says every lib when they want to change the subject! Smh

@thehill Can't wait to vote for Ted!
@thehill @SenTedCruz undocumented? So if I rob a bank do you call that a undocumented withdrawal?
@thehill Good for @SenTedCruz ... Someone has to stand up for Rule of Law & for American workers.
@thehill
@thehill @cagmcop TRUMP / CRUZ TICKET.
@thehill @FreeAmerican100 Dems have to get voters somewhere 
@thehill @tedcruz  Standing up for Americans. !
@thehill It is not just the dems. It is a problem with congressional leadership and most members..
@thehill @SenTedCruz stay strong Ted, stay the coarse of putting America back on track with Values & Morals.
@thehill idioys!
@thehill  @tedcruz Sen. Cruz is a second-tier candidate doing second-tier things. It's perfectly clear why he can't crack the top group.
@thehill @SenTedCruz TED CRUZ SHOW YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE FIRST? I BELIEVE YOU ARE ILLEGAL IN AMERICA,IS TIME YOU INFORM THE PLP.
@thehill The Dem's are as bad as the illegal aliens. Then don't care about the damage caused to [legal] people who deserve those jobs.
@thehill @SenTedCruz  Now in this Country pick & choose what law to enforce if you run a red light tkt DUI jail & jump the border nada
@thehill @SenTedCruz Ted is hardly anyone to talk about immigrants getting punished.
@thehill They are not immigrants! Immigrants are legal visitors applying to join the country. Theyre CRIMINAL INVADERS here to commit crimes
@tedcruz @thehill  Becareful not to become too harsh like Trump!
@thehill @SenTedCruz 
I love the fact that a Canadian born politician with a communist Cuban father is so anti immigration. Only in America
@thehill @tedcruz  Take your sorry Ass back to Cuba! Fidel will treat you great.
@thehill You mean future democratic voters
@thehill @tedcruz Cruz slamming anyone on imagination issues is too funny. His special interest masters don't want real reform.
@thehill @tedcruz they need a bigger voter base since lefts are jumping ship to the right side.
@thehill @tedcruz all aboard on Trump train.
@thehill  We're with Cruz
@thehill Cruz, the biggest voice in the Senate. Keep it up Ted.
@thehill Dems need illegals to vote! That's why they are protecting them! Go Cruz!
@thehill not a fan of Ted Cruz, but the man is a good debater and has passion.
@thehill ILLEGAL INVADERS
@thehill you go Ted
@thehill @SenTedCruz Gotta give it to Cruz for calling them out.
@thehill @BobbyR05435514 RIGHT ON CRUZ
@thehill @SenTedCruz They're illegal immigrants you PC pube
@thehill their braking the law & therefore illegal,not undocumented! Or can we now, pick & choosewhich laws to obey w/o legal ramifications
@thehill @SenTedCruz I would like to know why our laws aren't being enforced.  It's treasonous and this Prez needs to be removed from office
@thehill @SenTedCruz Misleading headline. Kate's Law is harsher penalties for murderers who return after being deported.
@thehill @ravenwings0205 #Rubio in Spanish says he will keep Obama amnesty
@thehill @SenTedCruz THE DEMOCRATS ARE ASSHOLES
@thehill @SenTedCruz llegal aliens need to be deported. Period. 30 MILLION illegals legalized mean #AdiosAmerica. We don't recover.
@thehill @SenTedCruz Undocumented? I think you mean ILLEGAL
@thehill @SenTedCruz Come on Raphael. Relax.
@thehill A latino himself who is an immigrant himself from Cuba would block his brother latinos from doing what he, the hypocrite did?
@thehill 

Cruz could execute all illegal immigrants
& we would still be overburdened by debt
oppressed by high taxes
& too many regulations
@thehill of course they block anything anti-illegal, he knows that or is Ted  asleep? he wants more percentage in the polls
@thehill Undocumented immigrants that reenter this country illegally following deportation? They're repeat offenders & cant claim ignorance.
@thehill Don't you mean "Undocumented Democrats!"
@crabbydick @crabbydick: @thehill Don't you mean "Undocumented Democrats!"  You got that right!
@thehill yay!
@thehill Whatever....Canadian.
