& the other Senators are absolutely correct @librarycongress the Left is always trying to f*#% with our language lawlessly...
@marcorubio know Trump out team up and get back in the race. If you truly love this Nation you'd do it.
Are they also removing "convicted felon"?
Good for you Senator! This is not racist but based on facts & history long before you were a Senator.
@SenTedCruz @librarycongress
Just further attempts to force fundamental change by any means.
such a loser.  And you cheat on your wife
what a politically correct left wing bunch of nonsense
add racist to your bio. You left it out just behind Christian.
name calling- your go to argument?
@benshapiro 
So, are other heading changes getting the same scrutiny? I think not.
#teatard
Wow, you did learn a thing or two from Trump. Good for you, now follow thru, and drop your donors.
or as nobama would say, "Uh,these people are,uh,not aliens,uh,they are,uh, now Americans,uh,by my executive odr
You are a powerhouse. Support Mr. Trump and guide him. He needs you...we need you. Thank you for your strengt
@bayes46 Right u are sir
as a @Harvard Law grad you should know that #nohumanbeingisillegal so you're the one with unsound judgement
Some background on the change - http://www.thedartmouth.com/2016/03/29/library-of-congress-to-replace-term-illegal-aliens/ …

Ted what makes you the one to give advice? Your credentials may be suspect after your very failed primary run.
alien means strange,entirely different,not from earth,its correct to rid that term concerning human beings,
@benshapiro @librarycongress can you call them illegals or do u call them future citizens
@benshapiro @librarycongress "anchor baby" is still fair game though, right?

says the guy who's home state's textbooks  call slaves " migrant workers " . Shame on U  #Politicallycorrect
requiring an act of Congress to change these terms MIGHT work if we had a Congress that worked!
@SenTedCruz @librarycongress
, @librarycongress should change headings 2 reflect language change, old 1s turn 2 alternate headings. Consult librarians 1st.
are you kidding me???The hell with this, it is what it is, aliens are just that,people not from this country
eh what can 1 say @SenTedCruz Atty's wrote perverted laws & created #BigGovt which gives & takes away @conservtivemom @librarycongress
Well at least Sessions was on the right side of that one. PC police in covert mode
Darn right!!
@CruzNewsLive @librarycongress It gets more and more ridiculous everyday, is there any common sense left in America?
thank, Sen Cruz
This decision by LOC is why Trump won and why you lost.
@UdvTANBgkh9NQth   Lamar Smith! I have known of his hard work for the people for years, quiet not on tv much but Great Warrior
if you had sound judgment you would of step down a long time ago
I see Sessions signed it!
Thank you 4 challenging them on this. Another example of PC out of control and having a negative impact on US.

As a father of daughters, I'm sure this commentary will speak to you
as says the man who is always #politicallycorrect
(LOC: feel lucky you are not his kids. They get spankings for disagreeing with him.)
How politically correct was your vote for Sec. of Army-or did you miss that one, too?
@SenTedCruz @librarycongress
Well said Sir
will you ever do anything to actually earn your salary but whine ?
Ted, very true, God bless America and help us keep Clinton out of the WH.
Good grief - now they're rewriting history?
What would you know about "sound judgement"?
"Sound judgment?" From four of the biggest bigots in Congress?
Sometimes Canadian @SenTedCruz makes Sense others not so much but he never gives up he's position even when he sounds crazy @librarycongress
you ted should base your decisions on facts rather than preaching bigoted uneducated hate #bathroombill
There is ZERO political correctness, it's a matter of receiving fact or fiction from the government.
let's keep negro and oriental in there too, right Ted?
. Technically, you're half right.
you are exactly right Senator!
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump 

#TrumpCruz2016
Amen
intellectual idiocy is a much better and more accurate description of 'political correctness' in general
to be fair, his strong advocacy for lowering the age of consent to 12 was anything but PC.
