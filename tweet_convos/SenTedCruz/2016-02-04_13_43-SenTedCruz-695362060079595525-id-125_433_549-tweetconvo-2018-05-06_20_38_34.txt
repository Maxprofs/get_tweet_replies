@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenatorLankford @ICANN
@SenTedCruz how bout freedom to know what's going on at places like area 51 as well, sorry but information should be free
@SenTedCruz How about fighting for fair and moral behavior instead of using underhanded tricks. Now we know why Senators don't like you.
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenatorLankford @ICANN Then why do you want to allow broadband providers to discriminate against content providers?
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenatorLankford @ICANN           Cruz no longer 2nd choice unless he takes action on who lied about Carson in Iowa!
@SenTedCruz Here is my thing. How do I know you won't be a cookie-cutter Rep. and cave to the Democrats once you're ellected?
@SenTedCruz Bla Bla Bla!!
@SenTedCruz Communist  Father Rafael Cruz backed Castro planted in the US to be raised to run as a false conservative.
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenatorLankford @ICANN lol said the man who's getting pay to do what they want you to do.
@SenTedCruz . matter and are not heard. Do not respond to nasty narcissists like Trump, it will drive him crazy, because he is a nasty baby!
@SenTedCruz You can not argue or talk to a narcissist. But the Narcissist "hates" being ignored", they hate being treated as if they don't..
@SenTedCruz It is like a friendly person under "a sad controlling of a narcissistic, mind-playing, controlling abuser".
@SenTedCruz Also... Trump is an abuser, game player & mind player that is "unhealthy" to the U.S. --- Those very involved with him may be...
@SenTedCruz to scared to speak against him because they would lose money or he would ruin their lives with false statements & games. ..
@SenTedCruz Being on the internet online is unhealthy in my opinion. Unless you are seeking to buy or sell something. ..
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenatorLankford @ICANN except you are doing the opposite and backing ISPs in screwing over consumers.
@SenTedCruz You've got a face I'd like to punch I tell ya..
