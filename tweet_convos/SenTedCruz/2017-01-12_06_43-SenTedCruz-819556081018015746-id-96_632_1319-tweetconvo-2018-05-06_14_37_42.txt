Wow, was never truer...
Politics makes strange bedfellows.
@SenTedCruz 
I pray for this and I pray for Israel, w/obama has done will not be forgiven!
Lindsey Graham finally being useful.
@lfh1744 Graham.ISn't he that shysterwithMcCAin? Cruz has redeemed himself, sowetrust him again.The others=NO
Cut off their funding and remove their headquarters from U.S. soil.
Cruz and Graham teaming up over anything is news.
Defund, withdraw, and kick them out of New York. Give them something to think about before Jan15th meeting in Paris.
OK, way to the comeback trail, Cruz! Thank you.
@tedcruz The UN should be abolished!!!
@SenTedCruz That betrays their IGNORANCE. The 5 P M of the SEC. Council dominate the UN and the World because of their LARGESSE
ALRIGHT!!!!!  These two were not who I thought would make common sense but I think I will follow them for a time.
AMEN
@tedcruz this is just dumb
@tedcruz about time Graham did something that wasn't left-leaning. I was starting 2 doubt which side he is on. Cruz, good job!
Not only defund it..get out of it and send them on their way so our tax dollars don't pay for them being here..#Americafirst
The world  is shaking I actually agree with Lindsay Graham!
@SenTedCruz #SenatorLindseyGraham That's awesome!  We are taking OUR America, the one we know and love back again from 8yrs hell
@LindaSuhler that's the best thing they have done in years... I ain't no fan of theirs but I hope they can pull it off.. finally
I must B tired..thought it said.."defend"..more like it to say DEFUND!
@AbbyMartinM #Globalists Agents want to Defund UN?!!! What's next Defunding #EU & #IMF? 
way to go!
They'll just get funding from someone else, most likely a coalition of middle eastern countries. O's Admin likely sewed this up!
About time Graham did something right
@clayfeathers SOMEBODY BETTER THIS IS A CRUCIAL VOTE THEY WOULD70 COUNTRIES TRYING TO DIVIDEN'T INVITE ISRAEL TO THIS MEETING!
@RefugeeWatcher Yaaaya!
@SenTedCruz hot damn you two finally doing something I could get behind
@tedcruz 
They need to push hard, enough to get that bogus organization off of our shores.
I agree!!! Not only should they team up to defend but get money back from UN.
Thank you Sens. Cruz and Graham. Israel, in a dangerous neighborhood, needs our support 100%. Keep up the fight and defund UN!
only prior time US back stabbed Israel was Carter adm. It's like bookends - Israel between two worst presidents ever.
@JtheDeplorable I can't get over Ted being a punchline, but he has been doing some solid work these days...
it's bc his voice can be heard now we have the WH, house & Hill. They should be able to get thier agendas thru now
Feeling & living American Again!! On Nov 20th we flush the Kryponite & Let the Big Boys Move in!! Superpowers Restored!!
Cool, a bipartisan offering.
@Ted Cruz yes yes yes
@SebGorka yes
@SebGorka   Close the UN down.
This would save American tax payers around $12 billion. #MAGA
@SebGorka long time coming
@SebGorka Defund and 86 from US!
@SebGorka Get 'er done! #StandWithIsrael #Consequences #StopFundingUN @SenTedCruz
@SebGorka Lindsey Graham is like shit that has hit the fan. He is all over the place.
@SenTedCruz  Don't forget to evict them from UN Plaza as well.
@SebGorka   Awesome!  It is s blessing to many!
get ready to load up on Graham crackers and Teddy bears before the illegals get them all...
I think we should defund the UN period.
Was the photographer falling on the floor while taking the picture?
get us out of the UN! #StandWithIsrael
lindsey? Really? I thought he had his head so far up Obama's ass he couldn't see a map to point out Israel.
@tedcruz 

Lindsey Graham's blind squirrel moment. Finally gets one right.
OMG Lindsey did something for us rather than against us ??? Hard to believe.
