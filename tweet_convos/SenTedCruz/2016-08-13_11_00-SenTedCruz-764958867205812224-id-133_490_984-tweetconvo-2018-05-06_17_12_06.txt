@PatriotGinger @tedcruz @POTUS  Ted Cruz is right.  It's taxpayer money...and not King Obama's slush fund. Sick 'em Ted!
might be It's not tax payer money. It's Iran's money that was impounded.
Possibly, bit I doubt it. Knowing the liars we have in power, it's likely our $$.
.@AZ_Truth @dallasnews @PatriotGinger @tedcruz @POTUS Its Iranian funds impounded in 1979. payment for oil we've already burned. Their money
Not sure I believe that. Still looks really bad. Why the secrecy then?
.@AZ_Truth @dallasnews @PatriotGinger @tedcruz @POTUS Timing could have been better though a healthy level of Skepticism is always good ..
Go home Ted Cruz. They aren't going to start answering questions now. Why bother. Nothing changes
I disagree.  Ted Cruz still has a lot of support and can make things happen. We can't surrender.
My point was Obama hasn't answered questions in 7.5 years. Why would he do so now?
You're a good man Ted, keep fighting the seemingly unwinnable fight! I'm with you, and other constitutional
conservatives (few and far) until the end!  We'll just go down fighting I suppose.
Not many people care about the constitution anymore? But, unfortunately, that's OUR loss...as an entire country.
Answered in January. Pay attention.
not allocated ever.

@WhiteHouse 

President can't announce, "I'm gonna spend unbugeted funds" & move forward on his own
Makes no difference, they were court order and Iran's own money.
It was only a fraction of Iran's own money. U.S. got a good deal.
QUE: WHERE DID POTUS GET THE FUNDS? HE DOESN'T CONTROL OUR MONEY, CONGRESS DOES!
I've got a pen and a phone! Remember that?
Means nothing in today's environment, they are hiding on vacation. GOP only wants to stop Trump now
2 best men in Washington in that picture
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz It still looks like Ted's only friend is Mike Lee.

@conservtivemom @tedcruz @POTUS All of America not only have questions yet demand answers from our malfeasant government.
so who do you think is the government?  Its us - you and me and the us citizens
Teddy, you were & are wrong about ACA, and you are just as wrong about this settlement.
Answer: it was a court ordered settlement for Reagan screwing Iran by not shipping weapons they paid US for.
act like man, don't pander. Just do your job.
Go Ted, give hell and don't let up. @realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson @mikepence4gov @mike_pence @GOP @greta

Dear TED, you demand . We the people want the ZIKA FUNDING BILL DONE .WE DEMAND you do your Job.
RINO Cruz you have lost your power. Sided with Clinton you are now the Devils Toy.

Simple by making an ass of himself the RNC.
Thank you for standing up Senator Cruz
Mr President, on behalf of Texas, I apologize that Mr Cruz cannot keep up w/the rest of the class. #BlueTexas

How much time and money will this phony shit cost us
Was made public months ago damnit
thank you #TedCruz ! Why aren't  Trump or Hillary demanding answers, thus showing leadership abilities?!
They already know the answer. Cruz is grandstanding to boost his wounded ego.
@KendrasMusic @dallasnews @tedcruz
Go Cowboys!
He knows the answers.
I'm sure POTUS is quaking in his boots.
I demand he sit his @$$ down. He gives us Texans a bad name.. I'm glad u s*** on Trump, but you can go away NOW!
Nah, I'm pretty sure it's Texans like you who give Texans a bad name; Not the good senator.
It was their money and you know it.  Now, could you go actually try to work-you know, at what we pay you to do?
congress is supposed to offset the executive branch. DUH!!! You need an education in government
Thanks Neal, I should be specific.  I would like Sen. Cruz to work on something rather than bitching.
he's working on exposing the criminality of the current administration.
WOW, thank you for explaining!  I suppose I'm a dreamer and just want to work on the future!
is say rounding up the criminals in the government would do wonders for the future of our country.
Needs to start from us at local levels though.  He needs to do better there, we need to do better here.
Hmmm, is "Lyin'" Ted Cruz still around and relevant??
So Donald Trump? The biggest joke n politics is U chose that loser
Ha!  The entire GOP is a bunch of misguided people. Hillary for Prez!
Hillary? The most Corrupted person running!30k deleted emails covering up Clinton Foundation/Sec State
you need to think for yourself and stop being a Fox News zombie.
Terribly stupid statement. Not FOX hound. Strike 1
THANK YOU, TED!
