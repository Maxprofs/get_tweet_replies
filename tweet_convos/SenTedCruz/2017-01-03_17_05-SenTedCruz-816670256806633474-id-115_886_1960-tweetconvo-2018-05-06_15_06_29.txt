I supported Trump for President, am American and support Cruz / Rubio effort for US embassy in Jerusalem!
@tedcruz  You missed how they will cut diplomatic security funding. Shame! (Remember how he cared so much about Benghazi?)
@tedcruz Cruz & Rubio: two Morons looking to cause more trouble in the Middle East. Embassy is fine where it is.
No, Every other country has their Embassy in Capitol. Why NOT Israel? J'lem has been the Capitol 4~3400 yrs
You don't know what you're talking about. Very few embassies in Jerusalem.See http://www.science.co.il/Embassies.php 
Little Marco and psycho T pushing for one state solution. Which is apparently when the rapture happens or some shit @tedcruz @marcorubio
actually actually rapture after destruction of Isreal learn before you speak seem less dum
- aka Lyin' Ted and Little Marco.
@tedcruz - Do you think it's appropriate to threaten to cut funding to embassies in order to achieve these means?
Cruz Rubio 69
Cruz - Rubio stay strong like Trump - he will need your strength - I'm seeing the W cesspool 4 the 1st time . Thanks wiki
Yeah!! It's high time America stands once again with the only democratic state in the region! And not sympathizing with extreme terrorists!
but they are kinda human rights abusers
ya, they kill terrorists without trial !!!
Innocent citizens. Not everyone there is a terrorist.
Sorry, you don't know what you are talking about. I lived there. The Palestinian Moslems are bunch of liars.
@tedcruz CRUZ FOR SUPREME COURT!
he is a Christian dominionist who seeks to destroy the 1st Am & create a theocracy #nodarkages
Renee - part of the solution or part of the problem? ... Youre not part of the solution
#liarsthrownintoouterdarkness #judgmentdayiscoming #iwontbackdown
does moving our embassy to Palistinian territory mean you'll now be pushing hard for a 2 state solution?
Moving it to Israel.  Palestine has no state
and Israel only has a "state" because the brits gave the European Jews the palistinian lands after WWII
The Brits gave to Arabs too. They said NO! Tell the WHOLE TRUTH! Not just the convient lie
Good idea boys! Let's get in another war. Any of your kids old enough to go fight? Maybe you two should go #dumbanddumber
the same bill that threatens to withhold embassy *SECURITY* funds???? @marcorubio @tedcruz @SenDeanHeller BUT BENGHAZI 
Would this move serve OUR country's concrete needs, or is it based on religious sentiments?
@coinabs How is that work? I am just curious!
@tedcruz @tempteststorm2 I believe that is what Pres Elect Trump voiced. Nice to see them on the same page.
Trump "voiced" it long after Cruz did. Trump has few original ideas; he co-opts Faux talking points.
the idea is not political. Doesn't matter who was first only getting it done.
hope they go and manage it too
@GaetaSusan We need to billet 40,000 us troops in Israel, after we wipeout isis, to maintain stability in the ME.
Cruz& Rubio your so far up trumps ass he smells your toxic breath My GOD maybe u should have that looked at!
@tedcruz you forgot the part about threatening American lives. #remembenghazi
TY gentlemen 4 loving our allies!
@SenTedCruz Isn't that exactly what our enemies want?? US showing that we are taking sides?
@SenTedCruz How does this further US interests in Middke East?? We do realize Israel does NOT set US foreign policy??
@tempteststorm2 it's good to see Pres and Sen on the same page. Don't care whose idea it was. The message not politics.
@SenTedCruz Not one person will answer how this bill furthers US interests in Middle East.
Only GREAT things would happen with that kind of move.
about damn time
These two should have ran together.  Missed opportunity.
@MitchBehna Thats been President Trump's position. Stated in his 2015 AIPAC speech.
As an American living in Israel, I sincerely hope the U.S.embassy is moved to Jerusalem.  May HaShem bless you both.
Sen Cruz & Rubio since everyone is concern about cost shut down Emb. in Cuba build a nice fortified one in Jerusalem win win
Lets get the move done my friends.
YEAH MOVED: TRUMP BE THE ONLY ONE THE MOVED......
@tedcruz As long as the US stands with Israel we will not fall.
@WeThePeopleFor @TheRightScoop "Great Move"...finally
@tedcruz yeah. Right on
yeh, yeh, yeh
@SenTedCruz What the hell for?
Doing the things he promised he'd do in his first 100 days... even w/o winning the nomination. WTG Ted. Keep fighting!
Meet sassy Leah/Israeli love story/Tunnel war/Temple Mount rising/Gefen's spellbinding 2018, A Novel
@SenTedCruz Hat is not to save you from hell if you don't reoent
That would be the most pro Israel action the U.S. Has taken in 8 yrs! Great move & good timing!
IT SHOULD BE MOVED TO CUBA.
They just might have Jesus in their lives.

@SenTedCruz There's a jewel in your crown waiting for you two. 
Was that East or West Jerusalem?  Because another name for West Jerusalem is Tel Aviv.  Needs to be East!!
@SenTedCruz 
@karen_prenger 

Jesus Christ....
I'm betting one of these two will be president in 8 years. I am enthusiastic about that.
It's about time. The move is long overdue.  We don't need Arab oil anymore as we become energy self-sufficient. Arabs never were our allies
oh shot
stay strong we are with you!
thank you
@SenTedCruz about time 
Way to go. Will safeguard Isarel and make other side take the necessity for peace seriously. Bout time.
@SenTedCruz Just wanted to let you know that The Second Coming isn't coming.  Please move Israel to Florida.
POTUS still has time to sign the bill, that sounds exactly what he proposed in 2008:
@TheRightScoop @tedcruz
@SenTedCruz Ted isn't even from the USA! Canadian citizens should not be able to move our embassies!
That is exactly what Trump wants to have happen. Also, term limits.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
at a boy! Get ur done!
@tedcruz Thank you
@tedcruz isn't the US Embasy location ultimately up to the host nation?
can't love this one enough. #JerusalemIsTheCapitalOfIsrael
@tedcruz When u have 1000s yrs history n the moral n ethical entitlement 2the land post 1967 war, Israel s/play strong hand.
Are you two nuts?  "Make war, not peace" is your motto now?
@tedcruz from where?
@tedcruz this Guys are for real , Bcz they really understand the problem is the Middle East
@tedcruz 100% behind the move
@WillMelton2 I don't like either of them, but can back them on this
@AppSame Amen
@tedcruz 
We must protect GOD'S land
BEHIND THEM!!!!
@tedcruz @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump
WHY DO THESE CUBAN BOYS(ASPIRING PRESIDENTS)ARE USING JESRUSALEM AS THEIR SPRINGBOARD?
@tedcruz what a waste of time & money for no real change
It's a waste to support the only democracy in the region? Which is a strategic area for us to have an interest in. yep you're right:waste
moving the embassy to the capital seems like a waste. What will that accomplish & is it worth the effort?
@tedcruz Great and much needed move
@tedcruz @marcorubio Yes!!
haha
Amen
are you crazy?
@tedcruz All the other embassies are in Tel Aviv. Why move? Waste of money. Thought you guys were conservatives?
@tedcruz Thank You!! Now stop the scumbags from doing something horrendous in Paris on the 15th! I've had quite enough!!
@milo9 For me at least the only positive take on Trumps election is that these 2 assholes were the main GOP alternatives!
@tedcruz 
I find this a good thing...
@tedcruz Continuing the same policy when it's failed again and again is crazy. This is the right thing to do.
@tedcruz The Miami Law Firm. #CruzandRubio. Get injured on the job call #CruzandRubio
@tedcruz puppets to Trump? We will all see soon.
@tedcruz Pray for The PEACE Of JERUSALEM!!!
What could go wrong there.? Such a quiet,  friendly city.!
Yes, it is.
these two Men, should relocate to Jerusalem before moving the Embassy, to ensure Israel is not impacted negatively
Yeah!
Jesus won't approve the funds.
Why are these fuckers so much more interested in Israel than America?
Because they support democracies, unlike your Socialist loving Obama and his Cuba/South American love fest!
@RitaMMiller24 Awesome! #StandWithIsrael
@AppSame o would suggest blowing up the Dome on the Temple Mount - great views of the city!
GREAT JOB!
@PolitiBunny and Tern Limits yo!
