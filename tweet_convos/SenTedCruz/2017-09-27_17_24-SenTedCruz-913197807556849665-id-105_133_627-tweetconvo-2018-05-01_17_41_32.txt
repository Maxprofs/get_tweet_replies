You gonna mess with the vote on their aid package Teddy?!
Thank you for being a human being and realizing they are all American citizens since birth! Unlike you who is Cuban and Canadian!
A week plus, later?!?!
Temporarily waiving the Jones Act is a good start but much more will be needed. More than 80% of the island has no water,food orelectricity
Senator it has been OVER 8 days. Too slow. Cut the tape. Need water and diesel distributed.
Please don’t forget the USVI.
why did it take so long to waive Jones act for PR?  It was waived for TX much quicker.
...hahahahaha....words mean nothing without action
So why didn't you vote for reform of the health plan?
Where were you last week, Ted? After the hurricane hit, why were you not demanding the Jones act be removed? #wastedsenateseat

Hey Zodiac Killer. Puerto Rico's power is out so they can't see your tweets.
You're a bit obtuse here ms Wong.  Cell phones & generators all over the place.
Yes, we as a country are united by this guy...
Dumb reply to help going to Puerto Rico...you lost...don’t forget that!
Thank you now get off the bike and take a car Puerto Rico
If you believe that, suspend the Jones Act and send real help. People are going to die.
How about you help in efforts to vote for healthcare? "He puts the Bible to the sky and then he lies, lies, lies."- Shepard Smith
So, why is help so delayed, Senator? Delayed by Prez u support & his obsession with NFL football?  Thoughts on his crazy? You support him?
That's not true
Is it a sin to think about homosexuality? Or is it the act the sin? Is my brother only sinning during sex? Bc well ...Porn now ok right?
"Hold fast, Help is on the way"
@GOP @TheDemocrats #PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow 
#TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Where in the world is the cavalry ???  Ridiculous....send help NOW damn it !!

Help the blue water Navy veterans get their earned agent orange benefits before they die

Healthcare Ted and now tax reform pray for PR but do your damn job.
Where is it?  The hurricane happened almost two weeks ago
If it's anything like the way TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz was united & dedicated to those over 100,000 Veterans who he let die, R.I.P.
Russian ADs Released ?  So Russia & Soros are both trying to instigate Riots & Chaos in USA. Is this all part of Hillary Deep State Plan ?
Lol!!!!! Riiiiiiight
Hey, you  do know we can get things quicker to the ISS then Puerto Rico. Why? Water? I think we won the water obstacle thing centuries ago.
Taking you out in the primary Ted.
Why isn't it there already Zodiac?
Your President doesn't care about Puerto Ricans.
Need help Houston Texas too !!!!
#PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow
Shoulda already been there.  Why so slow?
Why can't you get a temporary waiver of Jones Act?
I'm excited to measure your influence in DC by the length of time it takes you to keep your word!
Help has been on its way for 7 freaking days! #TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
@AmaliahOrg have solar power portable gas stations we need help with shipments from NJ to PR we helped #sandy #harvey #Irma ready 4 #MariaPR
The Republican are a majority.  Why Don't you get rid of the Jones Act.  Your party can over rule the President.
Puerto Rico IS the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! Seriously, didn'tvyou know this?
Why don't you get the President to call the CEO of major airlines to pick up the Americans out of Puerto Rico.  Do something TED!
Total and complete bull Sace yourselves! #Republicans hate everyone but themselves & wont even let us come help you! #GOPHumanFailures
Save not sace!
Where the hell has the GOP been?
Can’t wait for Election Day!!!! 
Help IS on the way but first gotta have a Nuremberg Rally, pick a fight with some football players and stop by Indiana.
How about you do something to get your fucking fax working that would be a good start
Help should already be there!
They are dying. 18 deaths today.
Help takes longer to get there.  It's an island with severe damage.  No power, radar for flights, roads for transport.  Maria's fault.
It's kinda hard to "stay strong" without water
Too bad the @POTUS isn't, won't waive the Jones Act because the shipping industry doesn't want it!
Propose a temporary waiver to the Jones Act!  Fuck shipping magnates.
Some sort of military airlift of supplies is needed.
#PutinBot
No words. Action this is becoming your Katrina. Horrible response. I know the big ocean
You should be Thanking Mark Cuban & Pitbull - They donated private jets - nit just paying for them!
I salute them for that how ever they both have huge investments in Puerto rico!
That only took a week for you to acknowledge our fellow citizens. Is the next tweet the *raise them up* one? #CanCruz18
Do you have a ETA...didn't think so.
You should try to speed up the process of Puerto Rico becoming a full State.
Uh, Trump isn't. Just to let you know he just found out it's an island in lots and lots of water. How about bypass him, trash the Jones Act.
Um not really. President lying about efforts.
https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/913088574983168000 … @tedcruz @WillHurd  Please follow through, why hasn't Governor of PR pulled people to help? It takes team work!
Maddening. 
3,000 shipping containers packed with food water & medicene have been sitting at the port in Puerto Rico since Saturday 
Pardon me if I don't hold my breath. I'll keep donating to relief efforts, tho.
Sending porn to help distract you while you suffer waiting signed Lying Ted
What took so long?
Help should've been staged and delivered immed, but alas.  And now, 3000 shipping containers waiting to be unloaded. No gas, ppl can't get..
To work. If I were cynical, I'd say it's because PR speaks Span and tans easily. Dude, your Hisp constituents are waiting to see what YOU do
Why are you harming Americans?  Hospitals are turning people away for lack of funds to purchase health care.  They are dying.
Then repeal the Jones act.   Get those supplies to the people.  The mayor is San Jaun. Take cake of the US Citizens NOW!
Private Jets r taking supplies & rescuing them b4  @realDonaldTrump even gets there next week.Thank you @pitbull @MARKCUBAN45
Repeal healthcare for the working poor in America to save billions and let pal die but you suddenly want to lose billions on Puerto rico..
Thank you for your support and everything you are doing to bring relief to #PuertoRico! #PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoSeLevanta
So you're pressuring @realDonaldTrump to stay the Jones Act?  What are you ACTUALLY doing as a Senator besides tweeting platitudes?
Help should've already been there. What if Texas or Florida had to wait a week? You should probably delete your tweet genius.
Right
$7 Million aid = $2/person
Help should already be there!!!
Wtf is taking so long.
You can't tell the plighted in PR anything. Libs have painted the narrative, as they have with race baiting. It really is domestic terror
Ted can lend a hand...just one though...his other one is busy...
Send them free porn it'll help.
Help should have been on the way last week you dirty Canadian
it's not our fault if you have no roads and bridges to get the supplies we sent to where you need it
help yourselves
Your face is crooked...
When?
Eliminate the Jones Act. Modernize the US disaster response. No excuses.
If these were white citizens would you have been there by now?
They probably can't see this....
Roger.
Is there TV or internet or newspaper where u at, Ted?  You still seem so out of touch.

The president told me your dad shot Kennedy and your wife is a dirty pig... was he telling then truth?
Just so we're clear... Puerto Rico is part of that same United States.
Ted Cruz’s Twitter and the mainstream appeal of incest porn http://nydn.us/2y0bAAD 
Please pressure him on temporarily lifting the Jones Act!
Why? Explain why you think it should be Temp lifted? Legit question!
Tell that to your president
