Great #AustinTX shot. Here is my shot of the #ISS heading over Austin on 1/29/2017 at 7:17pm.
have you experienced the "overview effect?" @Space_Station
Good morning to you! We waved.
LOL Danny, way to keep things in perspective. PEACE
@gabby_reyes5 Have you seen this?
OMG YOU JUST MADE MY DAY!!
see Austin traffic is not that bad if seen from certain angle and great distance
Only because you can't see the lower level of I35. 
A neighbor alerted me there would be a visible flyover so I was waving- little tiny dot there if you look.
