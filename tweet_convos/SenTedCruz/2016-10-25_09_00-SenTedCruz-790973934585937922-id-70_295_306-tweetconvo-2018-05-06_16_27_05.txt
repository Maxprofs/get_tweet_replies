@SenTedCruz @toddstarnes he's in GA a R run states and they didn't take Medicare expansion that's why program screwed. R's broke it
@SenTedCruz @toddstarnes Why didn't you ask #insurance co. & ask why they're gouging that guy & others like him for big #profits?
you mean meet the country. Everyone's rates have gone up since Obamacare. It is criminal what obama has done.
@SenTedCruz instead if trying to repel it 40 times why not try to work w. him to work out t. problem for t. ppl & not ur agendas

.@FoxNews @SenTedCruz @toddstarnes One guy out of 13 million that got healthcare finally? Seems like a good tradeoff.
What has the GOP party offered to replace the ACA ...nothing!!! If they cared for Americans why don't they offer something better?@FoxNews
happened 2 us over a year ago...it doubled, then went up another 30%, then we were fined because we let coverage lapse

@SenTedCruz @toddstarnes again you lie about who's to blame and your party members and voters cant even do a google search. Sad
You miss the part where BCBS says guy's 2016 plan won't be offered in 2017. That's because BCBS chose not to. #Greed
@SenTedCruz @toddstarnes remember Ted shut down the govt and put millions of Americans in financial hardship just to score points
@SenTedCruz @toddstarnes you voted for your own failure And then blame Dems for problems ur own party made at your request
@SenTedCruz @toddstarnes they tanked their own state program and now blaming Obama for actions of state govt being  obstructionist

Trump bobbles attack on Obamacare. Republican nominee tries to clean up his comments.Employees don't have a problem. He lied.
my parent's went up by 80%
just one of a million stories. NAFTA got my job. Fanny Mae got my home and now Obamacare keeps me from healthcare.
Doubled premiums under Obamacare is more common than reported. Truth of the horrible impacts are obscured by subsidies
so did mine and my husbands.
Think about it, that's right at $22,000. a year for insurance - who could afford that.
179 to 653
.@FoxNews @toddstarnes Why can't HRC supporters see that Dems are using the same OCare "keep them stupid" strategy to get HRC elected?
remember when the Obamacare crafter said the American people were to stupid to understand

@cnn @cbs @abc @msnbc
What say you about Obamacare. #any comments #no #not about Trump
terrible and Fox Host continue to let Obama pinheads say "it's ok the subsidies will go up too"WHO U THINK PAYS THOSE!
Obamacare will go down as the biggest boondoggle in History and has wasted Billions we didn't have to waste, Thanks
