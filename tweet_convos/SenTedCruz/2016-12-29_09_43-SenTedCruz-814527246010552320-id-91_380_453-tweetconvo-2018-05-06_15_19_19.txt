@PatriotGinger @ActForIsrael but deleted all Radicals from the database! ? President Traitor!
#defundtheUN  #withdrawfromtheUN
this administration has done nothing but tear down America & Israel and fund terrorist
Well, except for that $38 Billion of your US taxes it gave as a free welfare gift to Israel. Want it back?
Give $3.8 Billion annual welfare cheques to a foreign nation is just fine, but stop US election fraud? NO!
@ActForIsrael Completely defund and Kick that wicked entity called the UN out of the USA!  We don't need nor want false peace!
It isn't anti-Israel it's just law abiding. Israel's settlements on Palestinian lands are illegal!

@PoliticalShort @ActForIsrael so does the billions of taxpayer money that allows the welfare state of Isreal to exist.
US tax dollars are also funding on demand free abortions in Israel.  Are you going to stop that too?
Thanks for the wonderful news, Ted. The sooner #BDS eliminates apartheid in Israel, the better. Help out or get out of the way.
US Tax Dollars fund abortion-on-demand in Israel. Where's your outrage?
@ActForIsrael @HispanicsTrump @MikePenceVP @Reince @newtgingrich @ Rules chg; buy American&from businesses on UN list
ASenator Cruz is right about protecting Israel!
@CounterJihadUS @ActForIsrael ok but I believe we just forked over $3B so I don't see a problem . $3B is way too much- let's cut

@ActForIsrael OK Speaker Ryan do that defunding stuff now
@ActForIsrael  The UN is like the Nazi SS, building lists of Jews for further solutions
@ActForIsrael go home cruz.
@SenStaceNelson so stop it already
So it's ok to fund an anti Israel database but not an anti Muslim database? Obama has made his beliefs very clear.
@ActForIsrael US is the largest contributor to those funds. Stop the US funding of the UN
@LibertyUSA1776 @ActForIsrael DEFUND UN!Terminate lease on facilities.Give UN 30 days to get out ofALL UN Visas expire 2/20

@ActForIsrael It won't stop till January 20th.
Trump has found more money for veterans other then the Fed money to states violating fed Law. UN Funds!!

Keep the facts coming Senator Cruz.. We need patriots to help and you are one..
Senators & Congress should stop the abuse of US taxpayer $$. How much money do US get fr other countries? NONE protect taxpayers
US taxpayer $$ being used to fund many world agencies that are anti-American USAID, agencies in our own system!
@ActForIsrael have you seen the news? Benny Boy is under investigation. Take your blinders off.
@mrmik1234 that must stop.
!! @SenTedCruz http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spfv36?new_post=true â€¦
Time to BDS the UN
How come you aren't commenting on Bibi's bribery investigation? Hookers got your tongue?
Amen. Time for US to leave the UN and turn that NY property into something productive.
@ActForIsrael there is nothing good a data base like that would be used for...
#LyingTed
Then STOP IT!
@ActForIsrael Obama instructed DHS and FBI  to scrub the records of anything jihad...
@ActForIsrael dude you are in power, do something about it.  Stop complaining
@JohnCornyn @JudgeTedPoe GOT TO STOP? THAT'S WHY TEXANS HAVE SENT YOU GUYS TO DC. TAKE CARE OF IT! 
it is not a waste of money.  Israel will soon refuse to comply with UN resolutions and we need a way to sanction.
@ActForIsrael yes please, stop 
We should be out of the UN anyway. So put forward a bill immediately to defund, and kick them out of our country.
@ActForIsrael    I would like the list so I can do business with them.
   UN over or must B restructured.
Ted stay strong it's now time to pass HR1205 ASA & Leave UN
all the Russia b.s. is just that. Exposed emails! Whopty Doo! Obama used our money against B.B!
But Obama banned having Muslim/ Terrorist Database in US.
@ActForIsrael Time for the Anti Jew & Anti Christian people to sit down or get taken down.:
get after them Ted.  Withhold all funds from the USA.
This country has never been more corrupt than it is now! Can we stop it before it's too late? Sickening what we as citizens pay for!
@ActForIsrael #DefundandEvict
since  2008, #UN changed to anti Israel due to Obama's influnce. Shame to Obama.
-US gives Israel $3.8 Billion/yr of tax payer $$ 4 next 10yrs. 4 Military Aid, & lying @SenTedCruz b!tches about tax $ 4 BDS DB

yes it does
LYING TED AT IT AGAIN DISGUSTING KOCHSUCKER .
@ActForIsrael I used to refer 2 #Obama admin as a #SleeperCell but I was wrong. They're openly #AntiAmerican. #WithdrawFromTheUN
@ActForIsrael it's almost hypocritical considering the vast anti-boycott regimes we (The USA) have in place. #DefundTheUN

Defund and evict.
@ActForIsrael  our money should only be used to fund us programs to help our country
