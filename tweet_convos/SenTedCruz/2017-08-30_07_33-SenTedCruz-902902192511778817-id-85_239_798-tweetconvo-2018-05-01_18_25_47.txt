Be thankful for them! You turned your nose at Sandy.  And our @POTUS #HoustonStrong
Texas can count on Cruz, Abbott, Pence and of course our President to demonstrate great leadership.  Nice to see it. Texas are blessed.
I would like to be collaborating  there with all my will....
But from Colombia  greeting and appreciated...
God the bless you..
Nice photo op Teddy.
Sometimes u put ppl before politics. Not these 2. U vote against Sandy, but now want aid 4 TX. Ur despicable. Will they be reelected?
We up north will steadfastly support Texas relief funding even though you voted to leave NJ residents without help after Sandy.
We won't punish Texans for their evil Senator who denies help to those in need and then lies about it. Hopefully they will replace you soon.
Volunteers are so much better than you.
He could part the flood waters & you people would still whine & moan about a five year old vote. 
#youlie Great photo op for you @tedcruz
Never let an opportunity to seem interested slip by.

Lyin Ted...
What spending cuts will Ted DEMAND to offset any disaster relief for Houston? BTW, where has Tea Party gone??
You're awesome! Thank you for your service to our great state!

For Gods Sake, did Mc Cain, Jeb Bush, Kasich, Ryan, and others really take lots of money from Clinton to stop Trump? Isn't that treason ?
They better help quick as you look at cutting almost $1 billion from disaster accounts to help finance the president’s border wall.
They look thrilled
You're such a liar. 2/3rds wasn't pork. To stand there and lie as flood victims are coming in is despicable.
Our ability to help is  Becoming compromised by massive gas shortages
Praying for you and your great state @SenTedCruz God Bless Texas!
Why are they all pictures of you? What about the many Texans that aren't you?
How vile can you get? You are the worst of the worst--a mean-spirited hypocrite, just like your TX fellow hypocrites:
Resign, you friendless dope.
Boob Bait for Bubba - Ted Cruz quoting Sandy Bill had money for Alaskan Fisheries (Damaged in different 2012 storm & declared disaster).
El Diablo Pence refused to help victims of Katrina. Cruz refused Sandy Let's remember the cold blooded snake.
THIS is the truth -watch it! .@GOP REFUSED #HurricaneSandy aid. .@TheDemocrats MADE IT HAPPEN W/OUT THEM.     http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/30/politics/chris-christie-ted-cruz-hurricane-aid-harvey-new-jersey-sandy-cnntv/index.html …
#Shame
#LIAR.
Thanks mr Cruz for all you are doing and god bless
You're full of , using this situation for a photo-op
Did you forget this????
Have you forgotten?

"Even in a disaster, Cruz can’t help lying."
@JoanWalsh is pulling no punches, people.

Hey Ted, will you be a #PrincipledConservative and vote against a pork-laden relief bill for Texas?
Say it together. Photo op
Cruz, we'll be watching afterwards to make sure we don't see any pork stuffed recovery packages coming from Texas. Fiscal responsibility!!!!
way to lie about your reasons for voting to block aid to Sandy victims
YOU REGRETTING YOUR VOTE AGAINST HELP FOR HURRICANE SANDY??  #hypocrisy @BetoSenate2018
Your shirts not dirty Ted did you get your feet wet
Wait, I don't understand. How can a black man be happy to be shaking the hands of a #GOP #Senator? But, #IdentityPolitcs...
#Sarcasm
When Chris Christie has more compassion than you do, you know you're a real shitbag.
Major hypocrite @SenTedCruz. True colors come out.
Looks just like a photo op.
You lying hypocrite. Voted against aid for Sandy, lied about "pork". Be glad the rest of the US won't stiff TX like you did NJ & NY.  Jerk.
I would never eat or drink something @SenTedCruz handed me, ever! #daterape
I'd wear a glove also before shaking the hand of Ly'ng Ted...
Chiseler




POS!



Ted Cruz. Liar.

THEN GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASS AND LEND A HAND
Where was your vote for funding in the last huge hurricane? Now the shoe is on the other foot?
How you continue to get elected beats me  The same man who holds the Christian banner but isn't humble enough to say you made a mistake
So all it takes is a natural disaster of biblical proportions to get you to meet actual Texans...
Good idea to keep the gloves on when shaking hands with that dirtbag.
Translation: Could really care less about these people, just like Sandy. But...Thankful for all the photo ops at GRB Convention.
Why isn't your name on this letter?! Do you support white supremacists?!??  #HR496

#Censure #CensureTrump
Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks. 
Those of Cuban descent probably support white supremacy
Too bad POTUS is malignant narcissist incapable of feeling empathy for victims. We need a better President. #ImpeachTrump
