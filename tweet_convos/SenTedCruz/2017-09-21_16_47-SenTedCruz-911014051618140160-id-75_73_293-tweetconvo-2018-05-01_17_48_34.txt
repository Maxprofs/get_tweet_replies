Give that man MONEY instead. You are useless.
Photo opportunity for a politician on his way out.  Goodbye Ryan! We have seen your true colors. God Bless Texas, Florida & now Puerto Rico.
While John and I destroy healthcare for Texans. Our voicemail boxes are full so don't call, we won't listen to you anyway!
that’s tru i’ve called both of them
Public relations move.  How about you not kill innocent people with your heinous GOP "healthcare" plan?
Block-granting medicaid/care is Step-1 in #ACA-repeal for free-market solution. Get it done! @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @MooreSenate @BillCassidy
Amend #GrahamCassidy: allow m-caid/care recipients an opt-out, w/ state per capita rate following the patient. #FreeMarket #InterstateTrade
Why did Cruz vote against the Sandy relief bill but rush the trough of the federal government after Harvey

Trump wants to eliminate the federal program that oversees long-term hurricane relief http://bit.ly/2xiHrjj 
Wow. I'm actually inspired, thanks!
I'm serious, reading through these responses, my spirit is lifted from seeing Americans reject you.
Cruz voted against hurricane Sandy aid, now acting like he is trying to help after hurricane Harvey. Hypocritical jack ass.
did u tell the people u voting to take healthcare away? bet u didn’t.
your vote on health care will determine if you qualify enough to go back to Washington. .. so far it doesn't look good. . #aca
What was there a porn video of construction workers in TX?
Just wearing a hard hat in front of cameras is not helping.
And your help and support for Jersey and the devastation hurraine Sandy inflicted. Just what I remember NON-EXISTENT
Cruz beggin' for FEMA money while he watches porn.  Don't trust these liars who deny climate change.
I hope the out of state generals aren't listening
Lets not forget the leaking border! 
Theres thugs assaulting our agents and drugs a flying!
And next you will take their healthcare away .
Helped line your filthy pockets. Smh
Dont break your arm patting yourself on the back
Despicable Ted
Sen Cruz, u r allowing Rino Ryan to use you and Texas for a photo op!
it seems y'all could be using your time better than photo-ops...but hey, at least you didn't threaten to hurt anyone for a short period
Ted Cruz.
You self-righteous brothers are pathetic! America sees right through your false and needy narratives!
JUST A FUCKING PHOTO OP NONE OF YOU WOULD EVER GET YOU HANDS DIRTY UNLESS ITS FROM MONEY #GOPLIARS
Cruz, Cornyn, and ryan all together in a photo op? What a sick sack of corporatist shitbag exploitative situation are they propagandizing.
You blocked aid to @FDNY with post #9/11 illnesses and #HurricaneSandy victims. You have zero credibility or decency.
You guys know that the nails go in pointy side first, right?
Yes a wall that's been proven won't affect immigration at all. Yeah let's blow 26 trillion dollars.
Just hope they don’t get sick due to the chemicals in the air. #CassidyGraham
Ted and Paul now how do we get our cut of money pie???
Another empty photo op.
You didn't do shit ... it was a cheap photo op ... go back to watching your porn !
I only see a bunch of white congress folks..did you not allow sheila J Lee and the TX black caucus folks to attend?
Friends wood...where the suburban $$ is.
@IronStache looks like @SpeakerRyan prefers meeting with the people of Texas over the people of Wisconsin...
Love you, but not Ryan or Cornyn.  they could vacuum my house and I would still hate them.  Don't help them. Especially Ryan.  Filth.
The porno king himself
Will you help them again by paying for their healthcare bills if hurricane Graham-Cassidy blows in and leaves them without care? Vote no.
Thanks for the update, MSM is not covering recovering people of Texas.
Cruz never misses a photo op.
Why don't you help the American people & get Obamacare repealed or replaced, instead of trying to make the nightly news.
And why your in NJ and NY ask thier Governors about Cassidy Graham one Republican one Democrat they say no bipartisan
Paul get off the fence and show the American middle class u care about us get on board the Trump Train it now or never please vote YES 
VOTE NO VOTE NO
Vote for #Trump #Healthcare ONLY if it's good enough for @tedcruz #Senate & #Congress! Don't screw #Americans
Ted Cruz’s Twitter and the mainstream appeal of incest porn http://nydn.us/2y0bAAD 
Good for u Ted

The photo ops always look & smell fake. Especially when tweet yourself. #BetOnBeto2018
Maybe when your done head east NJ and NY still need rebuilding something about pork
HEY TED - HOW'S ALL THAT FREE-MARKET MONEY WORKING FOR YOUR HARVEY RECOVERY?  DID THE ALL THE FREE-MARKETERS JUST SHOWER YOU WITH MONEY?
What is going to be cut to pay for all this?  How did the government become the entity to make everyone whole? $20 trillion & growing!
Ryan and Cornyn only in for Kodak moment then back to blocking @realDonaldTrump agenda and protecting the swamp
Man you love to see yourself on tv. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Limited Government...Enumerated Powers!
While your @GOP colleagues work at taking away their healthcare... SAD!
Wow.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
#GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE.
