@SenTedCruz If only a senator in the 1960s had done that for Cuban refugees we wouldn't have you to kick around but Castro would! #GOPdildo
@egbee @SenTedCruz Cubans were randomly and conspiratorially killing americans?
@samstraughan @SenTedCruz He would not be an American, Teddy would have grown up in Cuba if senators wet their pants the way he does.
@egbee @samstraughan @SenTedCruz Pres can/have stopped immigration-Follow Law.

@SenTedCruz how about no immigration for a few years so we can assimilate the millions we've taken in?
@SenTedCruz @_CFJ_ Did you add the...If i wouldn't let them in my house. Why would I put them in yours, clause in there?
@SenTedCruz @deb_shelton And thank you Sen Cruz for standing up for us.
@SenTedCruz @deb_shelton I hope it passes.
@SenTedCruz @DNAProteinn it's great but I don't think it's good enough big man.
@SenTedCruz Thank you, sir. And thank you for providing a handy place to find and block trolls.

.@SenTedCruz Sorry Sir, it's too weak & unreliable. "Fox guarding the hen house",,,won't solve a thing. No NEW Muslim immigration is best.
@SenTedCruz

@SenTedCruz Is there an agreed upon definition for adequate or is it left to each Governor's discretion?
@SenTedCruz You and Rand should have passed his bill last week.
@SenTedCruz thank you!
@SenTedCruz  Should've had this bill long ago! 'Adequate  assurance' needs definition, 'solid' better; '21' days'? 3mos bettr

@SenTedCruz Your proposed legislation goes against every good American value. Your xenophobia strengthens ISIS. For shame.
@SenTedCruz @jbouie We could use some legislation that protects us from loudmouthed Canadians.
@SenTedCruz suck my ass
@SenTedCruz TY for writing a bill that does something, is understandable to usn non-lawyers AND is short enough to post in twitter images 
@SenTedCruz Do they realize, we've leaving in war time. Will they act now? or do they wait for a massive and catastrophic attack, then?
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz We Love You Ted!!!
@SenTedCruz state refugee act is the job of a Senator. Maybe you should try working that job for a minute before thinking your CIC material
https://goo.gl/bRrIiu  #cruzcrew Adding to @SenTedCruz, Ted Cruz positioned 2 among GOP past 1h hyped by Twitter
@SenTedCruz theocratic hypocrite
Unapologetically conservative & protector of our constitution. I like that in a candidate.  @SenTedCruz #TedCruz2016
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis GO TED GO! GO TED GO! #TedCruz2016 #CruzCrew #TrusTED
@SenTedCruz What if refugee gets better job, wants to move & pay taxes to your state? Do you want to stop free movement of legal residents?
@SenTedCruz Stop #FailureTheater; where are you calling out Senators on Omnibus, defund refugee program until secure?
@SenTedCruz I love how the people who didn't READ WHAT THE BILL SAYS are all over the Senator, making asses of themselves
Huh? States Rights!  I thought that #scotus un-Constitutionally removed those! @SenTedCruz Thanks - #TedCruz2016
@SenTedCruz Systematic cultural segregation, fear-based politicking and hate-mongering...hope you're proud or yourself Senator.
@SenTedCruz have you considered a split ticket w/Trump?  My dream ticket and one the dems couldn't beat.
AMEN @SenTedCruz I fully support this bill #GrassrootsRising #BlockISIS
@SenTedCruz lol the stupidity is strong with #Liberal #Trolls today...
@SenTedCruz hopefully you will get some bills passed.
@SenTedCruz keep up the fight sir
@SenTedCruz @marcorubio you two together would be unbeatable. realize things need to play out more in primaries but keep in mind.
@SenTedCruz Either prove that you are a US citizen, or get out of office. Everything you produce should be questioned. Everything.
Hey @SenTedCruz would this criteria be met by the VERY INTENSE background check refugees go through to enter the USA
@SenTedCruz I hope it becomes Law. Way to go!!!
Can't wait to vote for you.
@SenTedCruz Doesn't this violate some sort of constitutional amendment?
@SenTedCruz  WELL DONE MR. CRUZ  #AmericaFirst will be #AmericaSafe from Radical Islam #GodBlessAmerica #ChristianStrong
You have the wrong vision for America, @SenTedCruz. stop the fear-mongering  #refugeeswelcome #WWJD
@revnancyj @SenTedCruz "Fear mongering"? Too bad the 130 people in Paris and 14 in San Bernardino are unavailable for comment.
@PatriotAutoTech @SenTedCruz neither shooter in San Bernardino was a refugee. yes, "fear mongering."
@revnancyj @SenTedCruz But you're totally cool with the 130 in Paris who died at the hands of radicals from the same place? Good to know...
@PatriotAutoTech @SenTedCruz this legislation does nothing to protect us. it's pandering, clear and simple. Paris is a different situation.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz be careful Sen you are right on but the fellow So called republicans and left will attack you. Go Cruz and Trump. God bless you
@SenTedCruz Good work senator. Good looking out. Get the people behind it
