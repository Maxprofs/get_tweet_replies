@SenTedCruz How about abolish corporations getting tax loop holes while the majority falls on the middle class? #TedTax
@TellUsHowTrump @SenTedCruz That is part of the Cruz flat tax plan.

@Lynn_Rose1 @TellUsHowTrump @SenTedCruz  "Death tax" eliminated! You think this affects every estate, every death?  Charitable ded stays, HA
@Din_of_Inequity @Lynn_Rose1 @SenTedCruz Maybe it's just me but I don't see anything about corps not getting tax breaks/loopholes
@TellUsHowTrump @Din_of_Inequity @SenTedCruz Biz side is a flat tax also; no industry carve outs, subsidies etc. https://youtu.be/I6cUDscjrNg 
@TellUsHowTrump @Din_of_Inequity @SenTedCruz The "death tax" is huge for small family businesses including farmers.
@Lynn_Rose1 @TellUsHowTrump @SenTedCruz Personal, not business. It exempts the first 5MM and spouse. Then annual tax-free gifts to all. Stop
@Din_of_Inequity @TellUsHowTrump @SenTedCruz Most small businesses are S-Corps & tax is paid on owners individual tax returns; unlike C-Corp
@SenTedCruz Who is going to administer the law?
@Stuggots @SenTedCruz Treasury Dept.
@Lynn_Rose1 @SenTedCruz so you just going to remove the name
@Stuggots @SenTedCruz More than that, it will be a much, much smaller operation with flat tax and a clean start free from corruption.
@Lynn_Rose1 @SenTedCruz to say it's abolished is dishonest. Changed...yes. Abolished..no.
@Stuggots @SenTedCruz I believe the plan is to burn it to the ground figuratively speaking because of corruption & start over.
@SenTedCruz So, what agency will collect taxes. And go after the ones that don't pay.
@etcpolitics @SenTedCruz Treasury.  It will be a relatively small operation.
@Lynn_Rose1 Fairly small. Never mind the fact it's not enough revenue.
@etcpolitics It's very close; There's also $500 billion in specific spending cuts at http://TedCruz.org 
@Lynn_Rose1 Yes, I've read his list. Getting rid of those agency doesn't cut money it will shift to other depts.  We actually need them.
@etcpolitics Not according to the Constitution; it's significantly about getting back to the Constitution. Have a good day; have to end this
Do only Texans get it? Last time I heard anybody speak this obvious truth re: the IRS being a disastrous waste, was #RossPerot!
@SenTedCruz no its people like u & your party
@SenTedCruz Flat tax and abolishing the IRS would amount to the most successful Presidency in History. Fix Healthcare and its game over.
@mttoc @SenTedCruz A flat tax is regressive. Who does that help? Not the people Cruz claims.
@Din_of_Inequity @SenTedCruz You must include a non-taxable threshold level of income. Then come up with the flat tax %.
@mttoc @SenTedCruz 36K for family of 4. Wow.
@Din_of_Inequity @SenTedCruz We know what doesn't work. Must create change course now and get money invested back into USA.
@SenTedCruz @KWaters10 IRS: Income Tax Is Voluntary - CSPAN
@SenTedCruz Agree!
@SenTedCruz love, love love! Plz don't compromise on this! Irs is EVIL!
@Tinajwohlgemut1 @SenTedCruz Evil? A little too much drama there.
@Stuggots @SenTedCruz no not Cruz... the IRS.
@Tinajwohlgemut1 @SenTedCruz Yeah I know. SMH
@SenTedCruz IRS acts within laws Congress passes. Ur a member of that group: change the law instead of reading Dr. Seuss!
@SenTedCruz UNSEAL YOUR RECORDS, Rafael!
@SenTedCruz Abolish your regressive flat tax plan and your candidacy.
@SenTedCruz Drop out.
@roboticpressure @SenTedCruz why Ted Cruz is going to win and win big
@penadaniel87 @SenTedCruz HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
@SenTedCruz @TCuccio Mr. Cruz, a flat tax would get rid of my 2 biggest deductions, leaving me heavily burdened by my new liability. No help
@jean_laclair @SenTedCruz 

Getting rid of ObamaCare will save us $6,000.00 in Premiums alone.
@TCuccio @SenTedCruz I have insurance through my job, thank God. I haven't been saddled with Obamacare.
@jean_laclair @SenTedCruz 
We have an individual policy. It doubled in cost when ObamaCare kicked in, as well as deductibles. Also ended PPO
@jean_laclair @SenTedCruz 

Almost $12,000.00 per year in premiums and we still pay out of pocket with $6,000.00 each deductibles
@SenTedCruz    and.   programs.inbisness
@SenTedCruz @comnsenspatriot Leave it to a Cuban/Canadian immigrant to proffer a pie in the sky handout to the rich as reform.
@SenTedCruz @comnsenspatriot W/0 the IRS there will not be enough revenue to provide the basic needs of government. Flat tax is flat wrong.
@SenTedCruz that's the only thing he said I agree with
@SenTedCruz Abolish the IRS; then, EPA, Public Education, Income Tax, Health Ins., Welfare, SS, Medicare, Medicaid; & Disability payments.

@SenTedCruz and how will you fund the federal government genius.
@SenTedCruz welfare makes this impossible, eliminate welfare and make people get jobs instead of paying them more for each kid they have
@SenTedCruz Don't be an idiot. The IRS was created to protect our property as Americans. The IRS has forgotten that. Reform not abolish.
@SenTedCruz trumps our boy
@SenTedCruz @conservtivemom 
The most hacked dept in govt lets $6B in refunds get stolen & looks the other way. Not needed.
@SenTedCruz So True. It hurts many many people for many reasons
@SenTedCruz this agency is being used to take our tax $ to help illegals in order to replace Americans to gain more power for Obama/dnc
@SenTedCruz you talk all that shit but you didnt vote for the audit the fed bill
@SenTedCruz Are you willing to be POTUS for free? cuz with no taxes you no get paycheck..or roadsbridgesschoolsjudgescourtspolicefiremenidot
@SenTedCruz How will we pay off our debt if no one pays taxes!
@SenTedCruz NO THE TAX BREAKS FOR THE RICH YOU HAVE BEEN GIVING OUT HURT OUR FUTURE!!  #GOPHATESUS #KOCHSUCKERS
@SenTedCruz     Lyin Ted scored 1 bill out of 44 attempts in the pass 3 years!  IRS IDEA is another LIE trying to get votes. OBAMA RERUN!
@SenTedCruz 
Replace all income/corp/estate 
spaghetti tax code w/ 10% everyone-pays consumption tax
@SenTedCruz We're making less as a couple than we have in our lives, yet we owe taxes. Can't retire. Can't afford it. This is screwed up.
@SenTedCruz  BETTER YET , DUMP LYING TED .
@SenTedCruz and how are going to do that.  That is dumb.  How many people will you put out of jobs, i.e. accountants.
@SenTedCruz wa
@SenTedCruz Single mom of 2 making $45k/yr working 50hrs/wk gets $750 merit bonus - after taxes check is $468. 
Dad state of America.
@SenTedCruz and STILL who will collect our tax dollars? How will SSA be funded? It is NOT that simple. It is NOT the IRS. IRSUNDERFUNDED.
@SenTedCruz Tax Loopholes have been written in over the years to benefit the Wealthy.  They receive Tax Entitlements that exceed TRI a year!
@SenTedCruz tax system "administered" by the IRS? Abolish the IRS? Right..WHO created the crazy system, maybe we need to look at ROOT CAUSE
@SenTedCruz People will not willingly pay their taxes. That's why there have been tax collectors for over 2000 years.
@SenTedCruz If you could truly do this, and release the "chokehold" the IRS has on our country, then I would agree to give you my support.
@SenTedCruz Oh Contraire!  Very low Wages, lack of higher education, Union Busting; are chief culprits of destroying American Dream.
@SenTedCruz love to abolish its who's going to make sure people aren't lying on the postcard?
@SenTedCruz You can't abolish the IRS. Do you think further than you pointer finger? We need someone to oversee collection of the flat tax.
@SenTedCruz You and your desire to roll back the Constitution and further entrench income inequality are a threat to America, dream or not.
@SenTedCruz Our state tax scheme is regressive. Yes or no? Do you think a flat tax isn't regressive? Why abolish the IRS?
@SenTedCruz I think a flat tax all the way around. Everyone pays the same period.
@sanders_william @SenTedCruz Good lord. Everybody DOES NOT pay the same AS A PERCENTAGE of their income! That's why it's REGRESSIVE!
@Din_of_Inequity @SenTedCruz no shit.
@SenTedCruz yes it does. I have extra held out of my pay and when tax time came around this year I still had to pay in for 2015.
@SenTedCruz and replace it with what? a picture of your face saying "pay your taxes." That'll scare people into paying for sure.
-IGMA
@SenTedCruz WHO THE FUCK WOULD COLLECT TAXES WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
@SenTedCruz I'm Canadian, pls come back you belong to us...
@SenTedCruz your face hurts the 'murican dream
@SenTedCruz What have you done about it? Is Lois in jail?
@SenTedCruz I love how people get all excited about Tax REFUND! IT IS NOT THE GOV. Money It is yours in the first place.Take it back NO IRS!
@SenTedCruz it not just the IRS - it's our whole government. Corrupt, liars is all that the government has become.
@joeyhowze @SenTedCruz thank you
@SenTedCruz sure let the country go to shit! thanks rafa!
@SenTedCruz Seems like a good idea, however how would you make sure people and business paid into the system?
@WestslopeChris @SenTedCruz A small office in Treasury Dept. will handle tax collections, etc.
@Lynn_Rose1 @SenTedCruz Seems like maybe a bit like the IRS, but smaller?
@WestslopeChris @SenTedCruz Correct, it will be a much smaller version of the IRS but with a clean slate free from corruption.
@SenTedCruz lol. You're such a tool! You'll say anything to get a vote. What have you done to try and eliminate the IRS so far?
@SenTedCruz The IRS will always be an agency for as long as the United States is a sovereign nation.
@tropicaldan @SenTedCruz the IRS was only created in July 1953.  We can exist w/o it.
@ldillardj @SenTedCruz There will always be a need to have an agency that collects taxes. Can it be down-sized? Probably. Eliminated? No.
.@SenTedCruz idiot
I think at this point the American dream is that @SenTedCruz goes back to Canada with @realDonaldTrump stashed in his suitcase. #justsaying
@SenTedCruz The only way to abolish the IRS is to pass and implement HR 25 - the Fair Tax. Do you support HR 25?
@SenTedCruz Complicated laws and high taxes are evil. Democrats, liberals and leftists are clueless about this, and even enable it to occur
@SenTedCruz We all know you are just joking though???
