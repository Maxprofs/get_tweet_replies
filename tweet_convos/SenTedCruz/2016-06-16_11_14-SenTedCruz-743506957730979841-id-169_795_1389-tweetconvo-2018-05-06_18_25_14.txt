you mean like gays imposing their immoral Behavior upon Christian people and then calling us hateful.
I believe in individual rights not special interest rights
no I'm pointing out that if you protect the rights of the individual everyone is covered
I don't believe it special interest rights I belive in human rights individual rights.
keep fighting the good fight ur an inspiration and I couldn't be prouder to stand with you.
.@SenTedCruz @POTUS Your hatred is aligned with the terrorists. Shame on you - the majority of GUN OWNERS want these restrictions.
@ChuckNellis Except it's not really "failure." It's _refusal_ of Obama to properly identify islamist terrorists. Deliberate!
Obama has done more to combat Islamic terrorists than all the previous presidents combined.
Leftists are never interested in facts. Just spew leftist talking points like a mindless parrot.
he did? Can we get the direct quote? The delegates should press charges!
It's a shame that our esteemed elected officials are fighting over how to address the Islamic group, isis.
We shall stand at the ready, and we shall never, never, never, give in.
Please honor your pledge to support the republican nominee.
@jstines3 @POTUS and is treason pure and simple
Makes sense to Me Sir ! They have made their intentions known & O is fully aware yet continues to minimize acts against us WHY ?
but the ability to allow suspected terrorist the right to buy guns is ok???
Transylvania Ted at it again....grandstanding in the Senate.  Litte wonder he has no (zero) friends in the Senate.
Thank God, you're out of the race. Your delusional messianism would have destroyed me.
Your recent speech on terrorism was so terrific, I have saved it my records for posterity!  Kudos to you for making it!
who are U to speak, your failure to support our nominee impacts @Gop in fight for WH, HRC wins, illegals vote, Gop Is dead
OUr biggest enemy at the moment is the Gun Lobby - stop Arming America #DisARmHate .@SenateGOP
@Mason_Hummel @POTUS I miss him, a great conservative!
@LiveFreedomOrDi @POTUS Paul Ryan fears being targeted by Radical Islam!
Forever. With you. God bless Amen!!!!
Cruz- you are the coward.  You won't address the enemy.  You let them buy guns freely in our own country.
@JudicialWatch @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseHomeland #SecureTheBorder ! #DeportillegalAliens 40% #NoRefugees @TPPatriots
Cruz doesn’t always vote 2 support ISIS but when he does, it’s to ENSURE THEY HAVE GUNS #VoteBlue
the division of this country is the enemy. Work together. Stop spreading the hate and get shit done please
Thank you Senator Cruz for continuing to speak truth since, our gutless president doesn't do his job.
You going to read 'Green Eggs and Ham' now? #yourfailedfillibuster
PLEASE GET WITH TRUMP ON THIS
@CarlosHolmesTru It is obvious that you have never faced a real enemy and had to learn to pick the fights you can win. Stay home
@knuthf @SenTedCruz
@NileGardiner @POTUS he is right the #Islamist#Potus fools no one with this smug faux intellectual facade
the enemy is EVIL. And that evil can come in many different packages. EVIL is the problem not guns.
no more gun control
General McChrystal understands that sensible gun laws would protect us. Why don't you? http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/opinion/home-should-not-be-a-war-zone.html?smid=fb-share …
@CarlynRoot @POTUS   thank you Senator for still fighting for "We the People" !  Again and again .....  #ThankYouTedCruz #Truth
lovely dismissal of our troops that are, at this moment, risking their lives to "address the enemy". It's you who does nothing.
the enemy is your inaction to get assault weapons off our street
Standing for #2A while @POTUS and #MSM attack our rights, and FBI ignores warnings of #OrlandoShooter.  I thank God for you!
Leave your "enemy" in peace.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Are you a Christian or not?
PROUD of you Ted
Good Job Senator. I so with you would be VP pick.
@DonnaL12 @POTUS Good to see you back in action when will the LIBS start listening?
You couldn't be more wrong!  @realDonaldTrump will cost himself the WH!
Obama is so hellbend on tearing down America and its people but sympathizes with people who want to do us harm. SMH
this is disgraceful, ignorant, hateful & blatantly stupid. I couldn't be prouder of @POTUS @ChrisMurphyCT & @CoryBooker #Enough
NO @SenTedCruz bigots like you who hate and talk about killing members of the LGBT community are the enemy in this country ... not  @POTUS!
There, there, little Canadian. @SenTedCruz @POTUS
right on. You are a truevpatriot
Blah... Blah...Blah Blah Blah...That's all you clowns have to go on...I hope .@POTUS  NEVER utters those words!!
@SenTedCruz
welcome back to the fold ted. Now get behind Trump and help him win for the country !
Your Failures to do your job for the American people impacts us more than anything. You're 1 of our Biggest Failures.
You want to ensure that terrorists have easy access to guns. #accessorytomurder #NRAsBitch
keep up the great work senator Cruz. You would have been a great leader for this country as Potus.
do you not have ears?the pres addressed this bs of calling them radical n he is protecting us u prbly not privy to security
failure to recognize that not all Christians are AUTOMATICALLY republicans, and that "lefties" are more like W.W.J.D. than greed
get behind Trump NOW!!!
Why isn't the Senate removing this traitor from our WH?
Rafael's buddies King and Gomert have had ample opportunity to send Articles to Senate where Rafy can prosecute
***Radical Islamic Terrorists attack us and then @POTUS , democrat legislators, Hil-Liar-y and the MSM attack us! WTF.***
you lost. Be quiet
preach  it Mr. Future president 
@JerzyLuv2A @POTUS
you look like batmans enemy the penguin
ted Cruz for VP
Ted is smarter than all you all
Does anyone really believe Obama's omissions are accidental? Then consider the things he _does_ eagerly and maliciously label.
Obama won't call out "Islamic terrorists," meticulously prounounces Arabic words, deliberately misquotes our founding documents.
@ChuckNellis Obama claims calling them terrorists won't matter. Same guy who diligently/deferentially calls them ISIL, not ISIS.
remember when you shut the down the government
Obama must think the enemies are the people in the USA with his push for more gun control.
I stand side by side with @tedcruz
thanks you for stating the facts! This administration is not interested on our safety. God bless you Mr.Cruz!!
It's hard to believe a grown man and a senator thinks the American people would this shit!!

Go to work!!!
was it terism in newtwn, kmazoo, charlstn, Virg Tech, Giffords, etc. No worry Down ballot has final say so. U guys days r numbd
Ted Cruz you need to intervene and save us from the left we need all republicans to band together for the gr8er good. #2a
You lost Cruz...go away
not a fan of yr green eggs and ham
I know why you're against gun-control Ted so your father can kill another president
Can't utter LGBT hate crime, can you.  From the man who embraced Pastor "death to the gays" Swanson.
Are your principles so jaded you put out an abject lie.  Sentient beings understand the vacancy of your character
@ArizonaLuke @POTUS  If you could have beaten trump then you could have made some changes so take a seat and watch the show!
doesn’t always support ISIS, but when he does, it’s to ensure terrorist have guns. #Enough #Orlando
Murder is illegal, they aren't vilifying the murderer, they are vilifying the TOOL. And trying to limit MY ACCESS.
@JAW1133 that's quite a sunBern he's got there.
I believe congress declares wars. Go for it Ted, get congress to declare was vs ISIL.
This was a HOMOPHOBIC terror attack first and foremost! Why won't you talk about THAT in your speeches? #Pulse
"Failure to address the enemy?" What would you have done differently?
.@SenTedCruz @JMemblatt @POTUS -  but what if he supports 'the enemy' ~ MB has invaded our Gov't with sympathies for the terrorists.
you need to delete your acct too!?
my heart is broken since you dropped out of the race. Trump is going to wreck our country. He's too dumb to be POTUS!
address your failure to acknowledged and defeat your Republican nominee @realDonaldTrump
SHAME ON YOU. You LOST to a reality TV star. You ignore the people and embrace the cash.
What a load of garbage. We know who ISIS is, semantics doesn't change anything. @POTUS is right.
yo the only thing trump was right about, your are a liar!
At less democratics filibuster had substance. Yours was about Green Eggs&Ham. Don't be so ignorant.
Cruz, pure stupidity. Sit down and go away.
you are such a clown
@MelanieEli2015 @POTUS What happens when a Senator speaks and nobody cares? Watch the video.
Denial is a strategy but not for victory
yes, but refusing to use a name wanted by the enemy refuses to legitimize the enemy, therefore taking away what it wants
you are wrong cruz vote for gun laws
Citizens don't need military assault rifles-suspected terrorists shouldn't have easy access to guns.
https://player.vimeo.com/video/167607521 
Do U hope Repub party will rise up against Trump &get yr chance?No citizen needs military assault rifles-madmen terrorist
Well said President Cruz#cruzCrew#TrusTed
Thank you for saying this. I'm glad someone is.
Why the heck are you talking lying Cruz, you are done! Go away!
You accepted the endorsement of a preacher who wants gays murdered.
. @POTUS But,... You are the enemy @SenTedCruz
failure to back @realDonaldTrump will put in #neverHillary in office 
You signed the pledge stand behind it
we address them with bullets, drone and surgical strikes back with boots on the ground. Obviously you've never fought
cc:@POTUS
you need to get behind @realDonaldTrump #neverHillary
Islam doesn't kill people, people kill people.
your enemy is the society you are creating, that is your enemy.
Agreed. Stop funding resettlement of refugees and take care of Americans.  Take care of Social Security, Education,  ect
Your failure to protect us from maniacs having a gun, is enormous! Stop talking- start doing! #filibuster #gunviolence
Don't worry, @SenTedCruz, we'll make video with ex-softcore porn actress saying "radical Islam" over and over; that should do trick. @POTUS
u mean the American citizen that radicalized thru the web
Calling them 1name or another not an attempt 2disguise fact that they are aberrant/extremists..it's DIPLOMACY
Kill list says differently. Everything you say is a lie. No wonder both parties despise you.
Zhou tell them Cruz 
@POTUSI guess you don't think drones are doing their jobs? Nor our military?Nor our allies?
If you are too dangerous to fly, cannot buy gun. Teddy boy, how hard is that for you to grasp. #NotOneMore
A religious zealot fails 2 see the benefits of not tarring all Muslims with the same brush. Just working 4 his NRA bribe.
Sen. Cruz, he is taking action. Do something for the people instead of yourself. YOU WILL NEVER EVER BE PRESIDENT!
There are about 5times as many Muslims (1.6bil) as there are Americans; if it offnds them 2call ISIS Rad Islam,why do it?
Rspctflly disagree;akin2 stigmatizing all Christians bcuz screwballs like C.Manson et al do horrific crimes inGod's name
I have not seen President Obama take any action against radical Islam or Sharia law.
Yes :) ♡ Thank you Senator Ted Cruz
Coming from the imbecile that ate bacon off the hot muzzle of an assault rifle with a spork.
@twright55 @POTUS BLESS YOUR HEART SENATOR CRUZ
we are watching and we vote. Sensible gun laws
urgh the devil himself @SenTedCruz
.@POTUS, the failure to address the enemy impacts every action taken to fight that enemy. 
What is in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet #DoYouEvenShakespeare
Losers are good at making lofty speeches.
Well, that lacked anything specific. I'm convinced...
Trump as Prez could nominate you to fill Scalia's seat.  You would do country far more good there than Senate or WH.
.@SenTedCruz Obama say the names & words we use are not important,  but insists on calling ISIS ISIL.
Oh, what a body language we have lost
And if the enemy is a enemy of a enemy of a friend does that make them a frienenmy?
Give 'em hell Ted!!
chug my dong
great  points.
Not only that, POtuS claims Muslims are peaceful and Christians inspire violence through hatred. This is EVIL.
Keep up the good fight, Senator Cruz.
you failed to as GOP.
shut up...
