You want it grown next door to you? Believe me you don't. I live in California. Our problems are endless.
No not next door & I didn't ask for recreational use like your state only for those w/ documented severe chronic pain  @Alisand3 @SenTedCruz
Ppl that grow it will kill you or your child if you accidentally get close. What if your child chased a ball?
That's why I specifically said a farm for pain management docs only Not in the neighborhood for personal consumption. @Alisand3 @SenTedCruz
plus it's a nuisance crop. Uses to much water etc Ca always in drought. Pollutes, noxious odors,property values
Maybe it's time for you to move! @Alisand3 @SenTedCruz
I know. California sucks in a million ways.
Funny how the parts of government you want to defund are the same parts your corrupting billionaire donors want defunded #Childrensbooklogic
Sen Cruz, keep repeating what u are saying. Be livid about it, raise ur voice, & u will be our next President!
Let's be honest, @BernieSanders only wants more D.C. Govt. as long as Dems/socialist are in power. Otherwise, shut it down.
That's exactly what GOP want as well when they're in power...
because shrinking government obviously makes it more powerful. Get real.
GOP only shrink it in regards to helping people e.g. slashing benefits
social programs take the vast majority of the budget. Go figure.
A flat tax is a fabulous idea and abolishing the IRS is even better! #nomoreIRS
@potus will fit on a postcard!
Yeah keep sucking that govt titty
@Mike_Beacham @BernieSanders Exactly!
Bravo Ted!
let's hire upstanding CEOs to fix it!! 
exactly
@jstines3 @BernieSanders exactly. The federal government already has more power over the american people than they should.
@jstines3 @BernieSanders No We want to reduce the size of govt Way to much bureaucracy to get anything done #ShrinkGovt #MAGA
Thank you for so clearly explaining why government needs to shrink in size, scope, and influence.  Perfect!
10% tax down under  works just fine!
I'm not particularly fond of either of these guys but Ted makes an excellent point.
isn't he married to a high level banker?Didn't they deprive us education so we could enjoy fruits of our labor?
"Put not your trust in princes." Good advice 3000 years ago, good advice now, good advice in 3000 years, if we make it.
Getting Big Insurance OUT of Washington is not giving more power. Corruption is coming from corporate lobbyists.
the people rejected u why did u #subvert #Constitution NOT #naturalborn = #traitor
you are comparing congress the the nhs it's like comparing the epa with the judiciary... Apples to oranges
so YOU are part of the corruption!
The problem is the MONEY. If the fed had to ask the states for $$ as it used to be, there would be no lobbyists.
Bernie Sandees OWNED Cruz who's Hypocritical, dishonest & Full of shit ! Just like all Repub'd  & corpe Dem's
DC fundamentally believes in doing the same thing over & over & expecting different results.
Couldn't have said it better myself. Brilliant.
Notice Bernie doing the itchy foot on stage? He was getting his own agenda thrown back at him.
Cruz is right on, and Sanders is a nut job
yes
Bernie needs not to understand the hair salon business, but BUSINESS, small business does not equal RICH.
we need to get the power away from career politicians and back to "citizen statesmen". #allrichwhiteguys
Bernie thinks the small buz lady is THE RICH & MUST pay 4 everyones healthcare next she must pay 4 FREE education
Ted, you're wrong.  You simply need to exercise the power properly.  Good policies, etc.
oh so you're saying that you're corrupt then..?  Makes sense to me!
most corrupt talking about corruption.  You can't even do your own job.  Sit down and shut up until ur voted out.
TEXANS: We need Senators who are going to represent us first. @SenTedCruz & @JohnCornyn don't serve Texas public; more obvious every day.
No, @SenTedCruz, your idea of a 10% flat tax does NOT end corruption, is a giveaway to the people who are most corrupt, unduly burdens poor
agree DC is rigged. Ted wants to limit DC's power. Bern wants u 2 trust a "socialist"w/ 3 houses & no real job.
This. Reducing the power in Washington reduces the power of the monied lobbyists. Move more power to states & communities.
@MAGAtrump5 @BernieSanders exactly, and the government can't run ANYTHING right, why would people want them to run health??
 drop...argument over...hers your  for participating #Bernie.
Where is your plan Cruz? Share it and ensure it doesn't cut healthcare for anyone.
how did they end up outside the podium? Lol
Don't give minority public forum nor should your give shows like CNN, SNL any chance to discredit you.
@ohioeagle05 @BernieSanders Same reason he backed Hillary!
preach it Ted!! #endthepowerofWashington
please repeal fully Obamacare, and pay fines back to folks who paid them, with interest!!
NO MORE POWER IN WASHINGTON !
Why would Bernie ever think debating you would end well? Someone's manager just booked Clubber Lang on accident.
Poor old Bernie, he had nothing.
AWESOME.
corruption is all over the USA.!
you@mentioned it takes 89 days to get a hip replacement. You failed to mention it is free.   Why??
Then ABSTAIN from Sessions vote. Trump/Bannon are corrupt. Sessions makes them worse. If U want to be President, ABSTAIN
Obamacare does not work, because the Govmt is terrible at managing healthcare. Just look at how VA is run.
@Ted Cruz DC is corrupt, why do you want to be president and why are you there not wiling to allow change. You corrupt as well.
@EvilEsq @BernieSanders. You both are #Soros puppets. Useless.
we want universal access to healthcare without the preexisting condition impediment, including access to birth control.
@WineAndLiberty @BernieSanders touche
Great job Ted Cruz!!
Socialist agenda is dead. Patriots picked freedom & a smaller gov. over being ruled. They disrespected us all.
or you could just reverse citizens united and get corporate money out of politics
you do know what citizens united is right? And why people like Hillary Clinton tried to get rid of it
@BlameBigGovt @BernieSanders Because the liberal answer to EVERY problem is MOAR GUBMINT, what did U spect from Grampa Commie?
could not agree more
Very good point!
#2020 Go for it.
@JustKate038 @BernieSanders Ouch. Don't use logic. Bern is unarmed in a battle of wits.
I'd like to impeach 99% of the legislators for corruption, oh and a audit on all of you
