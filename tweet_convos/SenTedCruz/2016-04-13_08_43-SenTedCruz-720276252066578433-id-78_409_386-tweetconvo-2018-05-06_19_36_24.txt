@SenTedCruz because the delegates don't have Trump in their pocket they voted against Trump if the people voted  cruz would lost badly
@SenTedCruz it didn't matter whether Trump had a ground game in Colorado or Nebraska he wouldn't have gotten a single delicate anyway
@SenTedCruz and the delegates are part of the establishment they don't like cruz either but they're trying to stop trump
@SenTedCruz the only reason why Cruise 1 Colorado and probably will win Nebraska is because the people don't vote the delegates vote
@SenTedCruz but right now Trump is beating Cruz by more than 50% because the people vote in the East  cruz loses badly to Trump
@SenTedCruz  #WeThePeople need to wake up! No matter which party we align with! DOJ should not(but is)used as political puppet!
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz said that if it comes down to him in trunk that he would beat Trump that he (cruz )would get more than 50%
