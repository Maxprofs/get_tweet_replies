@SenTedCruz 
Hillary has been caught in too many lies. If it comes down to both of you then I don't know which is better of the two.
@SenTedCruz 
You have been caught in too many lies can't vote for you. I believe you would be all about the money too. Can you be bought?
@SenTedCruz @SkyeShepard Don't claims you are Texan now. Can't wait to vote you out.

@SenTedCruz @LibertyUSA1776 7th grade, Mr Ashfield, day 1 of Texas History class, "You're not a Texan if you don't know our heritage."
@SenTedCruz @LibertyUSA1776 That was about 1964-65 & everybody passed his class!

@SenTedCruz If only they would secede. #Texas #TexasIndependenceDay #Gopclowncar
@SenTedCruz @HeidiL_RN If only...
Last time someone tried that, lotta people got pissed. 1861, I think?
@SenTedCruz I saw that you want to be rich, powerful and take over the world? No not right!!
@SenTedCruz I'd vote for you if you could prove that you are naturally born
@SenTedCruz You said....only candidates who win a state should stay. Rubio won. He gets to stay
@SenTedCruz For the love of God, our constitution & continued existence of the US PLEASE stay the course. Our nation was built by underdogs.
@SenTedCruz I read the reason Hillary is not attacking you, is you both stand for a North American Union, the end of USA sovereignty.True?
@SenTedCruz please do secede and take your cronies with you and you can be the grand master
@SenTedCruz   Good job with your win over Trump. Trump must not be elected President, ever.
@SenTedCruz proud to have voted for you and excited about supporting you on your way to the presidency!
@SenTedCruz I worry that we'll need to do this again
@SenTedCruz I would love to see 2016 on that doc.  :)
@SenTedCruz please consider inviting Marco to be your VP. If you do, the country wins #CruzRubio2016
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Then get out of the USA again. Maybe you can be president there. Here in US, you have to be a natural born citizen.
@SenTedCruz I know that Ted Cruz would make a great president. He stands for the Republic.  Thank you Ted, I am praying.
@SenTedCruz You rebellious dissenter! Texas joined the union. AMERICA! A house divided cannot stand. You are fallen from Grace. Repent now!
We certainly showed ourselves to be of independent and discerning minds, yesterday. Congrats @SenTedCruz! #TexasIndependenceDay

@SenTedCruz you'd be a perfect president for THAT country. Preach.
@SenTedCruz We may have to reissue that declaration after the next Presidential elections!
@SenTedCruz ...but the people of Texas do now constitute just another of the United States of America now, right?
@SenTedCruz Free? Didnt the Mexican government abolish Slavery in 1829, and didnt the Republic of Texas reinstate slavery in 1836?

@SenTedCruz Why are you lying constantly, Senator? I liked you and supported you, but YOU ARE A LIAR! So disappointing...
@SenTedCruz #TedCruz this shows the low depths Texsa has sunk to by voting for the most reprehensible candidate
@StevePh49215783 @SenTedCruz Trust me when I tell you lots of TX Dems voted for him just to stop Trump, will go back to Clinton in general.
@SenTedCruz this is what we need in the UK. Why does no POTUS candidate have an opinion to the UK/EU issue? Special relationship and all.
@SenTedCruz Proud to be a native Texan!!
