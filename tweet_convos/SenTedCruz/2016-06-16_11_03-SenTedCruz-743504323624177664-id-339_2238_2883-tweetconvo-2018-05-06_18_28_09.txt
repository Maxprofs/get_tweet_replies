actually, it was a terrorist attack on American soil at a gay club instead of #Disney which shooter considered
Just stating regardless of sexuality it was on American soil. It was against all Americans.
it was a terrorist attack against Americans. Skin color,sexuality,religious beliefs shouldn't be a factor
Black Americans. Unless they were all direct descendants of Africa. I'm not sure you understand what I'm trying to
<<<<----- LOL!!!! thinks it was ISIS.  It was an asshole FAN of ISIS!!!
Isis did claim responsibility for it
And I said they did. But they had ZERO knowledge of the attack til the day after. It was not their plot.
of course they didn't. But they said they did. That's good Enough reason to go wipe them out. Gun control instead. Insanity
This guy was an American, born NY, who NEVER should have been allowed guns. Lack of gun control = insane.
He was interviewed by the FBI 2he was denied body armor but they allowed him to buy guns plenty of gun control stupid people
buzzz WRONG. There was & still is no law on the books they could have enforced to stop him. WE NEED BETTER LAWS.
Laws will not stop a maniac from killing. More laws only take away freedoms oflaw abiding constitutional fallowing Amaricans
@proud2b4family Of COURSE bc the real AGENDA is to disarm the ppl & take ovr. NWO'S just around the corner & ppl hve allowed it
@silkride There goes lying Ted again,The 2nd amendment is not on the table. if you can't pass a test you don' need a gun
Its ridiculous that the GOP thinks moments of silence are the answer.
Wrong! What's ridiculous is that any nutter can buy an automatic weapon. But then - America's god is it's guns.
Wrong Pastor Richard. Fully automatic weapons are HIGHLY restricted, requiring a very expensive federal license @SenTedCruz
So how come this guy bought one? Way too easy to get guns in USA. @SenTedCruz
hahaha you cant answer
the Japanese never invaded the mainland. Why? Behind every blade of grass.....
Dems want those who serve in militas to be able to supply their own gun. Read the 2nd amendment again please. #DisarmHate
Is a no fly list American 'law abiding', if they're under FBI suspicion for ISIS jihadist views? Stop humping the NRA's leg, Ted
@Bane_Buster Yea Ted. Proud of you. @realDonaldTrump @TheFive @DiamondandSilk @ericbolling @OutnumberedFNC #republicanstogether.
not anymore ridiculous than you & your supporters working against @GOP nominee with record number of votes
@DefundPPNOW ironic that the same assholes who want 2 ban Muslims from entering the USA r so concerned about defending their 2A
no denying # of victims wld've been alot less if he had a less lethal weapon.Shame on both sides 4 sticking to ideology/cmnsense
you & your @GOP @TPPatriots and @realDonaldTrump only plan is to have intoxicated people in a bar handle it ... which is better!
.@SenTedCruz, when you treat firearms as your own personal breakfast skillet, you shouldn't be allowed to speak about anything. #Disgraceful
Once again, Ted and his @NRA flunkies LIE!
@PatHartNY   But the Republicans allowed it.  They gave away the 2nd Amendment.
Forever With. you God bless. Amen!!!!
thanks for sharing! I've added your tweet to my news updates at: http://rbl.ms/1lruhA7 
You are such a moron! If you are an NRA puppet, work for them, but don't when we are paying you to work for us.
Gun Control = Surrender to Radical Extremist Taliban!
the nra owns your soul. That's ridiculous.
there are many seats available, sir. Please, have one.
THATS WHAT TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING
Senate republicans have been failing the voters for 16 yes.

Trump Trump Trump
I really wish America would have chosen you to be our POTUS. Maybe by 2020 they will have had enough will you please run again??
It was not a terrorist attack...ahole. It was a hate crime, wake up!
What's ridiculous is that you're still speaking and acting like someone is listening to your sniveling voice.
@SenTedCruz
you are so right wished I lived in Texas
"law-abiding citizens" on the no fly list? You are such a tool. Go back to Canada.
Exactly right. Totally correct.
Its ridiculous that congress hasnt acted sooner. How many innocents must die till you shed a tear and pass a law.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
ISIS didn't plan this. Just a lunatic american citizen with hate in his heart and easy access to a mass murdering machine.
.@SenTedCruz Even law abiding citizens should not have assault rifles #MakeItStop #Enough @justin_kanew @iyad_elbaghdadi @rezaaslan
that is a total lie and I expect nothing less of Lyin Ted. We want a ban on assault weapons
It is ridiculous to keep guns in the hands of killers at the behest of the gun lobby.  STOP GUN VIOLENCE NOW!
Law abiding citizens who exercise their #2A right to protect & defend themselves are not the enemy.
@RoyCalbeck Well at least Ted can say its a ISIS attack
How much money did the NRA contribute to your campaign? The Lorax speaks for the trees. The Cruzax  speaks for the NRA.
Well said Mr. Cruz, well said.
- You are ridiculous.

Hyping terrorism to win political points is essentially terrorism. You're feeding the terrorists. Stop.

@bonnyfletcher5 Thank God you flopped in the primary because you have no idea what needs to be done to make people safe POLITICL
@c5hardtop1999 .....No chief...It's typical & Predictable!! Socialism always wants ur guns!!! #Orlando blood on BOs ðŸ–‘ðŸ–‘ðŸ–‘
@Nehemiah2_18 It is what Democrats do.  They know they created this mess and don't have any solutions other than banning guns.
Last I checked the Orlando shooter didn't kill people by throwing the Quran at them. #justsaying #fishmonster
@ImFarToTheRight God Bless You & Your's Senator, & may the Full Body Armor of God, Protect You. You're NOT Alone.
@Toth_4_Texas Senator Ted Cruz should be our next president!!!
@HilClin4WOPriso Disarming citizens makes them ducks in a shooting gallery for murdering terrorists! I'll keep my guns thank you

@nranews #YourNotLyin #lyinTed
thank God you're no longer in the race. Divisive fear mongering ass
@cerebraldebris Cruz, you lose.
@USATopGuns
how did #2A prevent orlando?
@etbuch Very True my Sen Cruz "We The People" Will defeat this Radicals here in America and abroad Almighty God Son HSpirit"Amen
Yes, Ted let's make sure terrorists can buy guns. Idiot!!!
@silkride Gun control, if your against it, what are you guilty of. That's the question.
Alcohol is involved on your end.
Alcohol, what, sorry about that. not me , maybe you.
@liberty_meme Awesome speech, Senator Cruz.  Thanks for leading the conservative movement.
@zanadu99laura 

Why don't you help defeat #CrookedHillary? Do you have to ask Heidi ?

@realDonaldTrump @MOVEFORWARDHUGE #MAGA
They are all losers acting like enemies
By the way, it's "high dudgeon" not "high dungeon." Sheesh, a member of the illiterati, huh?
@PatriotGinger do not remember Dems trying to ban box cutters after 9/11 Sad these people cannot or don't want focus on problem
@Tazmanian5 didn't they have the majority a few years ago, nothing then, why now?
@onecowherd Remember what the lefties say.. Never let a tragedy go to waste!
Not ISIS, just a deranged wannabee.  If he didn't have a gun, those 49 people would be alive right now. Reps. are responsible.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TED CRUZ. NO TO GUN CONTROL. OUR 2ND AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO BEAR ARMS STAYS. PERIOD
They are no Dems any longer Ted.  They are despots.  @Blackdi51264299
So glad to see you standing up for us.
It was a hate crime against the very community people like you demonize.
@Txwench that was dead on thank Ted for defending the constitution and the American people
it's not about law abiding citizens, it's about terrorists getting guns. Stop politicizing tragedies! #Disgrace
@Htrd34 they arm other countries while trying to disarm the USA
@Pancross37 GO AWAY TED
Not true @SenTedCruz, but whatever you say
Our own Gov wants law abiding citizens dead 
Damn right. You battle ted!
unify Republican  party. never HilLIARLY
@SBSportsDiva ummm, not an Isis attack Ted. Sorry.
The monster claimed to do this murder in the name of ISIS and ISIS took credit for it.
God Bless You Ted Cruz. We need more Senators with your candor and backbone representing the American people 
@nranews  No one is restricting 2A. Why are you lying Ted? We the people want to feel safe when we leave our homes.close loophle
You can't posit that access to an assault weapon in the first place gave this ISIS terrorist a tool to kill WITH.
loser
THANK YOU!!!!!
@ojhines2k That moment I agree w/ what you preach. Unite w/ @realDonaldTrump and help us defeat #CrookedHillary #AmericansFirst
How about #2A education
Teach responsibility, not fear. @SenTedCruz 
#GunControl
@ScottSdbrown
It's the reason progressives gravitated towards education in the 60s, start the "brainwash" young. @GerardKapraun @SenTedCruz
you're the best the country as to offer. Keep following the truth! 2020 sounds pretty good! Sorry you might have a big mess.
you are soooo right on
The left: Never let a tragedy go to waste.. Ron Emanuel. Just another ridiculous assault on Our #2A  rights, given by God !
***Radical Islamic Terrorists attack us and then @POTUS , democrat legislators, Hil-Liar-y and the MSM attack us! WTF....***
once again people think controlling guns will make thinks like Orlando not happen. Wrong sick people will still kill.
Wouldn't it alert the suspect they are on a list R being watched? Some of these investigations are not disclosed to the suspect?
Please explain due process to @Sen_JoeManchin maybe give him a pocket constitution
U r 100% correct Sir!Stay the course. If Politician's want to take rights of Citizens; maybe it's time we discuss #termlimits.
I encourage you to read and understand the meaning of the 2nd amendment
but, watch it slip away Ted. You supporters are calling fellow Americans stupid because they support Mr. Trump. Bo is staying
they should read this! Then they would ban knives!  ... http://tmi.me/1feuXD 
it's ridiculous that the AR15 with huge clips is legal.
@mlong42947 I am not a big fan of you, but thank you for supporting gun rights!
The Orlando killer was a law abiding citizen until he committed mass murder! Or, how did he legally purchase his weapons!
@smartgirls4gop If not for Trump, I really believe Ted would have won over the Conservative No nonsense crowd.
This fight isn't over.

@SenTedCruz can be nominated at the convention, and he can WIN at the convention.

@smartgirls4gop
Yes
@stephen_pisano Amen, keep fighting Ted!
@FreedomRingz76 Nice to see Cruz in the fight today.. God Bless
I'm sure you defend our 2A rights. Bc your the only one we can count one. Thanks Senator
@FreedomRingz76 Come on Senator.. Start kicking some ass and fight the @UN and @potus for blaming our guns and not Jihadists
@CruzNewsLive Please be our next POTUS, please please!!!
#NeverTrump
#NeverHillary
Dems might be attacking 2A, you my friend are offending common sense. Non-military/law enfcmnt have no need for an #AR15
So obvious that you should be our president!
What's that, Mr. Too Stupid To Understand the Point of Green Eggs and Ham? Where's our $24billion?
@MissSelfDefense give em Hell, Ted!
the Dems want to disarm me and my fellow law-abiding neighbors but we will not bow down to them.
.@SenTedCruz 998 shootings since Sandy Hook. 2 involved Muslims. 998 involved men.  Must B a Muslim problem,not a male #GunViolence problem.
@SupportNRAILA AMEN BROTHER AMEN!!!!!!!!
@RestoreHistory Good point, so why are you trying to get Hillary elected? You know you do not stand a chance now or in 2020.
#icantbelieveyouremysenator
.@SenTedCruz It's ridiculous in response 2 a mass gun killing, #GOP & @NRA wants to make access to #guns easier. #2A
It is ridiculous that in response to an ISIS terror attack, Dems seek to restrict the #2A of law-abiding citizens 
ENOUGHHHHH. #WeAreOrlando
@MLynnRN the man who should be our nominee
My Senator would make an excellent president. Trump has no chance. He's an absolute disgrace @nickballs2000 @SenTedCruz
Agree
He was an American. He learned his hate in America. He bought his weapon in America. Green Eggs and Ham, Rafael. #GunControlNow
@KingFelix47 These dopey conservatives are the epitome of con men.  They work for special interests with no regard for citizens!
ya, that's what we were asking.
What type of civil servant would seek to disarm US citizenry after such an attack!
#NEWS
@SenTedCruz
@wwrick
It's ridiculous that in response to an ISIS inspired attack you fight to keep guns easily accessible to terrorists. So wrong.
Nothing like defending the loopholes that terrorists praise & advertise to show your patriotism, eh? Way to help them, Senator.
When ISIS & Al Quaeda praise the lax gun laws YOU support, maybe you're WRONG? Or do you agree with terrorists? Seems you do.
Ted Cruz desperately trying to stay relevant
These amendments don't penalize law-abiding citizens, or affect them. They affect terrorists & criminals, whom YOU r protecting.
Please don't let Obama get away with this.. We need our guns.
you are a walking talking advert for abortion.  Maybe the dems don't want terror suspect to get guns-you disagree with this why?
please run 3rd party
@Ron_Hutchcraft Thank you, Senator Cruz!! Gun control is not the answer! Moslem's are!  #IslamIsTheProblem #2A
Let's quit calling them Dem's and start calling them Communist's!
Missing is the connection between a sworn enemies tendency to infiltrate for control and direction and the Democrats themselves
You are a monumentally ridiculous.
Since when are people on the terrorists watch list "law abiding citizens " and if they are they have legal recourse.
green eggs and ham, you have no credibility
it's good to see you being a stupid senator again, make breakfast for the all the families of the massacre, machine gun bacon?
Thank you for once again passionately speaking the truth. May truth &freedom  flourish in America again. God bless you.
does #2A include an assault weapon designed to kill dozens in less than a minute?
What's REALLY ridiculous is that you keep peddling that trash you talk when your own party doesn't listen to you. #shutup
@SenTedCruz
@STEPHMHAMILL Thank you for speaking up.
@GovtsTheProblem
I have never seen cars NOT be sold to all, because of OTHERS DUI homicides, nor knives be restricted over knife deaths.
Thank you Ted Cruz for fighting for the God-given unalienable rights of the American people!
@MooiachiRios Government should be opening a can of whip ass! Instead we get is Government over reach on its on citizens
can anyone list 3 aspects of our lives Libs, Dems, Progs don't want to control?  Heck, just one?  @mooiachirios @sentedcruz
Stand strong, sen. Cruz, the SCOTUS  "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED". My right, should not be limited because of a murderer.
that's not what is happening and you know it. Stop playing politics and save some lives. #fillibuster
