@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz no injection needed. It's already there! Hacks you off that it's one of the only places you haven't removed HIM!
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz can you do something besides repeat yourself?  Oh yah, He's in there. Starting w/God given inalienable rights
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz Someday whether you admit it or not it will be revealed to you
@andreajmarkley @SenTedCruz it's called eternity, and it begins at the end of our little bitty insignificant lives
@SenTedCruz Dead document Ted?
@Bdjma2020Fowler @SenTedCruz the dead document comment would be bordering on treasonous once upon a time. It still should be!
@dhamnormok @SenTedCruz The dead document means it can't be altered. It is what it is and should never be changed.
@Bdjma2020Fowler @dhamnormok @SenTedCruz Except for those pesky Amendment thingies
@pattykanan @dhamnormok @SenTedCruz Supreme Court judge base of  interpretation. We the People :)
@Bdjma2020Fowler @dhamnormok @SenTedCruz I have no idea what you are trying to say.
@pattykanan @dhamnormok @SenTedCruz Sorry, ok bottom line it should not be left to SC to  social engineer but interpret law by Constitution
@Bdjma2020Fowler @dhamnormok @SenTedCruz Yeah, that's they way it's supposed to work. 3 branches of Government and all.
@SenTedCruz God bless you and our great nation. Praying for victory in His name
@sentedcruz Remember that,  Rafael.  It’s not based on your dominionist views of your father. #theocrat
@zezzledog @SenTedCruz the greatest liberties of all come from Him
@SenTedCruz You abandoned it years ago... separation between church and state ring a bell?
@Auld_Phart @SenTedCruz yeah. Greatest misquote ever! That misconception was deceiptfully created by those who work to break down liberties
@SenTedCruz More to the point the constitution is the formula by which the balance of our society comes to be anchored.
@SenTedCruz I REMEMBER I AM GLAD HE IS WHERE HE BELONGS AS YOU & THE 47 WHO SENT THAT LETTER TO IRAN BELONG. IN HELL!! THE BLACK HOLE
@SenTedCruz You should share this with the #Senate.  So they'll get off their dead asses about this Justice Nominee.
@SenTedCruz including separation of church and state, right?
@SenTedCruz The constitution is what states Canadian Cruz is ineligible for Presidency. Not natural born citizen. Only naturalized citizen.
@SenTedCruz  the Founders thus outlined the moral foundation of a free society.
@SenTedCruz except when it comes to allowing America's first black president to do his const. duty and nominate a Justice for the SCOTUS.
@SenTedCruz  You said you didn't know you had to renounce your Canandian  citizen.
@SenTedCruz then vote on a scouts nominee, and protect women's 14th amendment right to choose
@SenTedCruz Constitution matters? Address the issue so Natural Born is resolved. No invasions! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca-sfq7l9VA&ebc=ANyPxKohzT00dbf_HkaiDivDj9q6SbB5LTX1HSuIALWbkBvSf9FpMfyynCwIhpnEOxUcTpDwVav4c1Qrvcf01K7FK88EnXktug …
@SenTedCruz Then why do they call you a constitutional con man
@SenTedCruz ..Congrats on your wins !!! Stay positive, clean and honest ... Praying for you and our country and God 's will and mercy.
@SenTedCruz EXCEPT FOR WHEN YOUR MASTERS LOBBYISTS AND DONORS TELL YOU OTHERWISE
@SenTedCruz then honor him by respecting what he created and stop trying to cram religious mythology into politics!
@BikerBecca @SenTedCruz Bull
@SenTedCruz @Red__Rover then why oppose POTUS making SC nomination? What Constitution r u not reading or failing to understand? Hypocrite.
bye! @DrWLeon @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz That's why TC should put blame where it belongs re violence at Trump rallies. Paid left-wingers sent to thwart free speech.
@SenTedCruz bless you
@SenTedCruz Except when it suits you.
@SenTedCruz All evidence to the contrary.
@SenTedCruz Then honor ALL of it, Teddie.  Not just the parts you like.
@SenTedCruz God bless you
@SenTedCruz I thought u followed the bible!
@SenTedCruz It is not political will, then but moral reasoning, accessible to all that is the foundation of our political system.
@SenTedCruz Cruz needs 2 go back 2 Canada Since Cruz is INELIGIBLE 2 be President According 2 the Constitution
@SenTedCruz Hey Ted, u ever read it?  If so, u would not oppose Pres. Obama making a SC nomination.  He nominates & the Senate has hearings.
@SenTedCruz even when your precious book of fiction, aka the bible, is against it?
@SenTedCruz The founding Fathers meant natural born citizen on U S soil.
@SenTedCruz fed tax was to come from the states as a hole.when the gov. can change the rules there is no rules! the people has no voice!
@SenTedCruz it is just words on paper unless the gov. obeys it, and we have seen that it will not!
@SenTedCruz except when it does not suit your purpose; #SCOTUS is most important to me &Americans & now you let us down siding w #McConnell
@SenTedCruz yes but u do twist the truth, Trump is going to win Texas, the ppl know who is best suited for the job to run the country, sorry
.@SenTedCruz Does the Constitution say that u should play politics with SCOTUS nominees in an election year? NO IT DOESN'T!
@SenTedCruz @LatinaforTed Happy Birthday Mr. President!  DAR member w/10 Revolutionary War Patriots in my direct line who fought 4 freedom.
@SenTedCruz The #Constitution requires #USSenators to #Advise #Consent on #SupremeCourtNominations - Uphold your Oath or Resign your Seat!
@SenTedCruz THEN REREAD THE CONSTITUTION bc you obviously don't know it well enough. #doyourjob #SenateGOP I can't wait till you lose.
@SenTedCruz @1RonnieD Thank you Ted!!! You make Texas Proud and for your principles!!
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 you are a Canadian Ernest Angley. Nothing but a con man You're not right on the VERY SIMPLE CONSTITUTION 1/2 the time!
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 Too bad @BarackObama @POTUS President Obama does not feel the same way as GW.
@SenTedCruz   God Bless you Ted Cruz!  No weapon that is formed against you, America, or Founding Fathers shall prosper. Amen!
@SenTedCruz Yet you want to do away with parts of the 1st, wage war on the 14th's Roe v. Wade decision. Sure, keep talking.
@SenTedCruz that's a American president not a Canuck Ted

@SenTedCruz TC Lies:CITIZENSHIP,LOAN AMOUNTS, BULLY MAILERS, LIES ON CARSON, CHEATS TO WIN, STAGES  VIDEO ON TRUMP & RUBIO, HE IS RELIGIOUS?
@SenTedCruz So does this mean you're gonna encourage @POTUS to appoint a nominee to the SC? Cuz that's in that Constitution thing.
@SenTedCruz You need to quit lying! Read Proverbs 19:9, hen Ezeiel 13:8 & Micah 6:12
@SenTedCruz All your dirty tricks are catching up with you! Fraudster!
@SenTedCruz How does one know you haven't abandoned the bible since we can't take your word for it?
@SenTedCruz The bible states a liar shall never tarry in God's sight.You appear to have abandoned the bible.
@SenTedCruz It would be nice if u spent less time lying and more time abiding by it like not running for President would b nice start #Trump
@SenTedCruz you are so full of crap it's running out of your eyes
@SenTedCruz @imyomelman326 yep 1795 #livinginthepast

@SenTedCruz @If you believe in the American people then allow a twice elected president to exercise his constitutional duty
@gentlemanirish @Smithstoreithsv @SenTedCruz @bluware_ron an unfair comparison. Ted has not gotten $100s of thousands in GS speeches.
@gentlemanirish @Smithstoreithsv @SenTedCruz @bluware_ron his wife has a sham charity taking in millions while she work for the government?
