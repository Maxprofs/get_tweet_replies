@SenTedCruz @DCEJim: #Washington's #republican's weakness is killing our country #StopRollingOver

@SenTedCruz I guess the 18 RINOs who voted for this perversion of founding intent don't realize they've put a giant target on their backs.
@SenTedCruz Thank you for fighting the #WashingtonCartel - unlike the establishment freaks, you actually STAND up for us! #CruzCrew
@SenTedCruz Total betrayal of those who voted for this budget
@SenTedCruz I can understand a bipartisan yay. But to have a nay completely from 1 side.  That's questionable. Proof of early negotiations?

@zoccolopolis @SenTedCruz They won't do that. They are afraid to stand on their own. They use the GOP, otherwise they have no power at all.
@SenTedCruz I know this is the senate and not the house but shouldn't the "Hastert rule" apply here for McConnell to bring this to the floor
@SenTedCruz saw the list of those voting with D, but am curious if Rubio showed up to vote on this one, b/c IT'S A BIG DEAL!!!
