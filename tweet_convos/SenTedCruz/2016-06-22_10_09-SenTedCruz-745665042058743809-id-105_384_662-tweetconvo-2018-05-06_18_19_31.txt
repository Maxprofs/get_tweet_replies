@Thunderhorse149 when will you honor your pledge, does your word hold no value? And honorable man keeps his word
Totally on the #TrumpTrain #Trump2016 #MAGA #NeverHillary How 'bout it #TedCruz; When r u supporting #Trump ?
I saw too many lies from Cruz,that was his only offense, lying,it's why he lost,I've been with Trump from day 1
Agreed on #Trump. I have seen many leave #Cruz cause of those lies,while he claims he is telling truth thru God.
I would show uncut video of him lying, and they refused to admit it. I just shake my head and MoveOn
Believe me, I understand completely. It is so frustrating! I have to take a break every now & then myself.
you sound like a great person, I'm proud to know you, and your patient, great quality to have
Thank you! It's great to meet you as well! Together, lets #MAGA & get #DonaldTrump into the WH! #Trump2016
... That's why the people didn't choose you.

Exactly! "We the People" we can and should defend ourselves against tyranny, domestic and abroad!
I'm embarrassed to have him as a senator for my state. But sadly he's the physical representation of most Texan voters.
Good thing that "God" is the one telling him to say all the stupid shit he says. How can a person of god be so hateful?
"oh yes, lets keep bombing the middle east. Lets keep asking congress for a blank check for war, lets kill innocent people"
then he turns around and starts praying. So how different is he from the "Jihadist" he wants to kill?
@izzysroses wonder why  ur amendment to Gang of 8 INCREASE immigration? Because ur a GLOBALIST puppet
.@SenTedCruz Get out of the way you buffoon. Adults are making meaningful public policy here. #NoBillNoBreak #DisarmHate House Democrats
get out of this country. Anti-American socialists are not welcome. Try Venezuela.
@SenTedCruz
Never thought I'd see the day I agreed w/Sen. Wyden, but on this I do: LE already has the tools, needs to use them better.
Thank U Senator Cruz. The main job of government is protecting US. #TedCruz2016
seems you are a has been ..
.@SenTedCruz I am SHOCKED that you would want to do this, KNOWING it is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!  How COULD you betray us???!!!!
Not by looking on our computers without a warrant!!!  What the hell is wrong with you????
His statement says, "authorized," and I assume that means a warrant. Cruz is a stickler for the Constitution.
I don't assume anything but I KNOW he voted for a bill that would allow warrantless searches
This is the code being amended: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2709# …
dont care. We see Obama use IRS & FBI against us so no more warrantless searches. No more tyranny
Why don't you phone Cruz's office tomorrow & ask about it; phone no. @ http://Senate.gov .
Throw out the Muslim brotherhood in our government
Terror Ties of Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Exposed & Analyzed 
@MayIrmamay14 @SenTedCruz
Sorry @SenTedCruz....You simply can not claim to love the Constitution while simultaneously work to degrade the 4th amendment.
Like the right to peaceful assembly.
Newtown
Charleston
Orlando
Columbine
Yet YOU do nothing
LIKE THIS ONE, SENATOR? Ashamed of your YES 06/22. I voted for you! NEVER AGAIN. How could you?
@CNN had a clip of 6 Terror attacks in USA-->Gov Had #TAKEN Boston Bombers #OFF the #NO #FLY #LIST, @oreillyfactor Fact Check IT
You think protecting the NRA is more than protecting American citizens.
Dear @SenTedCruz, please vote NO on Collins gun control bill and McConnell spy bill.  I'm a constituent.  PS: Please pass it on to Cornyn.
. Yes, they must,  but they won't. Keep up the fight Senator!
and let terrorists buy guns
Great Senator!!!
@ShoeKat  kind of like how Ted Cruz, so constitutional when he voted to compelling Verizon to spy on me, much 4th amendment.
Ted I voter for u in Fl/but I am against U if U think Trump the solution /He change on ever issues that he promise/ Dump Trump /
this is your opportunity to destroy Hillary. Push the Republicans over the top.
You could just petulantly shut it down again. Not the best person to define the duties of the federal government, are you?
I know you're supposed to be educated, but have you read the Constitution? just asking?
#4thAmendmentFail I supported you but glad you lost before you destroy the #BillOfRights
, then pass common sense gun laws. #NoBillNoBreak
Come back with something on guns= KST list people cannot buy guns & FBI alerted immediately before they buy black market guns...
who are you
you need to get behind Trump so Hillary doesn't win. Time to let bygones be bygones. Forgive and forget.
yes. We should not allow Muslims into our country until they are completely vetted.
law abiding should be in quotes. #illegalsrcriminals
your vote today to trample our God given rights underfoot in the name of "security" will cost you dearly if it doesn't change!
A huge supporter of yours Sen Cruz & a proud alt delegate for you at convention. I'm not comfortable with McCain amendment.
so why did you vote to further erode our 4th Amendment rights? Hope we can count on you to switch to NO on the re-vote.
anti gun activists look dumbfounded when you spurn every attack on the 2nd amendment!
Does that include the domestic terrorists, sitting on the congressional floor over gun control, right now?
Bad move Cruz.  #StandwithRand
Quit terrorizing "them" and they'll leave us alone.
get ur ass behind Trump and support him. Quit acting like he doesn't exist.
The problem my friend is that government & bureaucracy are infested with Leftists who want to strip away rights.
Do more then just talking . No it's hard trump needs you to defeat Hilliary remember Supreme Court
protect our constitutional liberties. Stop importing terrorist!
by letting terrorists buy guns cuz that seems logical #NoBillNoBreak #BeOnTheRightSideOfHistory
why does POTUS keep on attacking America?
The current administration is blind to misconduct.
#BREAKING Baby dies after being hit by gunfire in SE Fresno shooting last night- Police say. 
Trump is perfect for the job. Elect @realDonaldTrump President 2016!
if he wanted to keep USA safe, we would be safe. Instead he's purposely making us unsafe. It's so clear. He's one of them.
yeah and i figure you have the solutions...#worthlessgop
Why is congress trying to turn American people into terrorists? Our Constitution is under attack by liberal communists.
so why not get together with @ChrisMurphyCT and co-sponsor bill that will unite the country instead of divide it. Everyone wins.
Donald Trump beat you. That's pathetic.
I AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT. KEEP FIGHTING FOR US SENATOR CRUZ
And that's exactly what they aren't doing!
Fighting reflects fighting.
The US fights. We must learn how & not just because of a perception of patterns & algorithms.
QUANT
Unless of course that constitution interferes with your ideology or religion?
@GOP @SenateGOP But just in case they (killers) make it to Gun Purchase, let's make sure they can buy right? Both internal & ext
where are my rights??? (Senator Joker)
go put on your Goldman Sachs jacket
What's your plan for that this country has home grown terrorist and sleeper cells here plus thousand of illegal aliens come here
my constitutional rights Senator Ted Cruz sounds like you're preaching to the  choir
Shut down & arrest TOR/VPN servers so hackers can't hide anymore. TERRORISTS USE TOR.
Look...twins! #DisarmHate #Enough
Everyone knows, they are preparing to send in the UN to TRY and take our guns.
Not the UN..we know they don't do anything. They're sending in the Christian extremists since they're not fully armed.
They don't like Christians or us. Loretta Lynch signed the deal 4 civil unrest. They will not say Muslim terrorist
how about keeping guns away from terrorists? @CNN @NBCNews @CBS @ABC
The Gov cannot keep us safe. We must rely on one another. Liberty is what we give to others by letting people live unobstructed
be a stand up guy..& support TRUMP or kiss up to corrupt insiders..people r watching & won't forget
They r trying desperately 2 get r guns. They r the ones letting in the terrorist.Someone has to speak up
yr fed now infiltrated with jihadi moslems how do u expect protection?
Evil forces working against the American people. Mr. Cruz you have to tell Americans what is going on.
Help unite the party Ted! Tell them all you support Trump!
can you deliver copies of our Constitution to #democrat members of #Congress ? Should be required reading
I see you found your job description. #DisarmHate #Enough
I also expect the government to keep me safe from assault weapons. #guncontrol #NoBillNoBreak

@GlblCtzn

Your inaction to pass ONE law to help curb America's gun epidemic is causing domestic terrorism. How do you sleep? #DisarmHate
epidemic taught by govts who've misused their power & put people in position of distrust.
I'm not responding to you bc you have "portal" in your name and it might take me somewhere I don't want to go.
I thot fed gov decided where we go to bathroom & what to eat for lunch.
Unfortunately they are protecting those who want to harm us.
FACT: Everyone fights because they believe they're protecting the survival of their beliefs.

#powerofnature
Can't speak for anyone else, but i only fight in self defense.
