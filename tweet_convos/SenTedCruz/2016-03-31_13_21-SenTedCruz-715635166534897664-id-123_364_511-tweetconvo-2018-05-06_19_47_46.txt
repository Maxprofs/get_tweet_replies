.@BLMNational arbitrarily & unlawfully claimed private land along #RedRiver in #Texas. We must stop this land grab http://1.usa.gov/1UX8iqw 
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational Because you hate the environment? Not a fan of clean rivers?
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational I think you n the boys already sold a lot of US land to the Saudis n the Chinese. Wait til they come TO GET IT
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational Please ANY REPORTER, GET BECK.ask him about BLMNational!! Loser Cruz, you just lie faster than the slow brain.
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational No worries Trump will fix it.
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational Or, if they want to take private land;
@ckirmser
Horseshit lie. Fed owned all western land prior to statehood & Fed land was explicitly disclaimed in many state constitutions.
@EvolveHumans Try again, pal. I quoted the #Constitution exactly and that's all that counts. Once there's a state, the land belongs to it.
@ckirmser you selected one out of context part & baldfaced LIED about it. Settled law, Fed can own land. You sell horseshit.
@SenTedCruz amen , its time to put a stop to the corruption of the @BLMNational, we need to put an end to these unlawful land grabs
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational 
Oh. Now you're for #PropertyRights?
Why can't someone like me buy a house in Texas w/o giving away mineral rights?
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational 

I guess #PropertyRights only apply to your big donor buddies & land grabbing fossil fuel corporations.
@SenTedCruz @BLMNational 

Face it Rafael, you're #BoughtAndPaidFor and everybody knows it.
