@CNN CAN WE STOP CALLING IT OBAMACARE? USE FACTS. CALL IT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
@MSNBC @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo @NBCPolitics @ABCPolitics @CBSNews @WSJ @washingtonpost @USATODAY YES PLEASE!
That's not a debate. Bernie will spout nonsense. @SenTedCruz will demolish it intellectually. You'll lie about it. #obvious
Or we could just watch Ted fumble on live TV. You'll lie about it. #alternativefacts
The day Bernie says something smart while @SenTedCruz fumbles, I'll grant you a point. #WhenHellFreezesOver
lol
@SenTedCruz hope all goes well Ted. We have faith in you....let's see a very smart vs an old socialist.
Use social security numbers for identification. People just show up and everything is paid for.
@SenTedCruz #CruzCrew is THE ONLY reason I am watching your channel.SOCIALISM SUCKS
Bernie is going to humiliate him, can't wait to watch
this will be awesome! Another opportunity to show sanders a crook
ted you perro can't Waite till your up for reelection
@CruzinAhead my fingers will ache switching to CNN. But I'll do it.
BS needs to go to Commi land.  Not an American
senator Cruz did a great job thank u sir
Why is this on a commercial station and not on C-SPAN?
that'll be interesting.
Bernie will DESTROY Cruz
Godspeed Sen Cruz!
@SenTedCruz Cruz is about to put Bernie in his  place
battle of the losers
please , ask cruz why she voted for devos, the end of public education as we know it
@CNN It is actually the Affordable Care Act.  "Obamacare" is the "nickname" GOP Republicans created. #ACA #healthcare
watched on demand Cruz like all repubs selfish & only care about  wealthy & big business. 45s sick but this nut is as annoying
Bernies idea waste of time & Cruz just wants 2 remain in spotlight so Trump wil notice him-no solutions created in town hall!!!
If facts matter, Cruz will destroy Bernie!
Divide people among insurance companies to pay the bills.
what's the point of these two debating anything?
@BernieSanders Does Ted get a house if he loses?
battle of the network krakens
I'm only watching this if you can guarantee #BernieSanders gives #TedCruz a piledriver a la #TheUndertaker style
@SenTedCruz go get him Ted

@CNN what will Cruz eat on live tv this time? 
will @tedcruz eat another debate booger? Get em @SenSanders
Why is there a debate?? WTF?? Aren't we sick of this silly shit yet?? What's there 2 debate? Worse than preseason football!
lmao Ted Cruz is going to demolish Bernie.  All Sanders does is pander.
predicting Ted will go down in round 3.Bernie still has a few good punches in him...dig deep Bernie!
@SenTedCruz ok but only because your on, but only this once.. @tedcruz
Oh lords all Sanders wants to do is take money from one person & give it to another!
@SenTedCruz
please call it THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Apparently ppl don't get that it's aka obamacare. #dontrepeal #duh #responsiblemedia
Why bother Sen. Cruz. Don't give those liberals ammunition. They just want to whine don't give them any platform

Yikes, Bernie will destroy Ted
@CNN I gotta get up early so I'll probably watch this so I can fall asleep fast.
@SenSanders waste of time... No point in debating someone if they are coming in close minded @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Sanders is a moron, no match for Cruz. Although im sure the cheats at CNN will even the odds some way!!!
can't wait. Returning from my 2 years hiatus watching news on CNN. I'll wave for couple hrs. #alternativefacts

@CNN old man Muppet the socialist.
@CNN the angry Muppet democrat sell out.
looking forward to this debate/schooling Sanders!

@SenTedCruz Trying to up your ratings?
Ted Just tell #Bernie keep his hands in his own damn pockets to cause his budget reform ideas to go down in flames
@SenTedCruz   TED, CRUSH BERNIE!!!
go show them what you're made of Senator Cruz!
whoever uses common sense, wins.
@CNN Thx 4 giving Bernie a platform 2nite. Should've during primaries. Covered empty Trump podium instead.
Cruz will be slick; dodge, bobble, and weave.  Bernie will be well prepared in both knowledge and rationale.
Look for Cruz to deal in parodies, sarcasm, & "put-downs!"  Love's to distract by playing, "gottcha!"
@SenTedCruz  too bad it's on @CNN  or I could totally watch it. Love Senator @tedcruz !!!
Ominous, dangerous venue! Watch your step, Senator Cruz!!
@CNN why waste time it was a doomed train wreck from the beginning
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump two losers! Oh no, three!!! I'm sure CNN will be unbiased!
why?  What a waste of time
@CNN that is a waist
Bury him Senator Cruz. Put that old man 2 bed.
@SenTedCruz @BernieSanders Did Bernie get questions in advance.
@SenTedCruz Cruz will win debate !
boring and no one will watch
Why are haters on here or on any post of importance. Just shows the itelligence associated with Trump supporters.
@smokeyvera SERIOUSLY I should Care Why?
@CNN  why is my percription $1,000.? Let Walmart and Walgreens take over health care. They are the experts.
OY!! can't think of two more annoying politicians
Pelosi and her minions
Would love to see Mr Cruz destroy Bernie's socialist arguments - but I refuse to watch your network.
@CNN I hope the audience is diverse base race, party & gender #SandersCruzDebate #newsonenow!
The question is...35% of all American's are on Welfare. 560,000 are homeless and 8,700 of them veterans. Why? Jobless.
under GOP ppl arent just at risk of losing ACA (w no replacement), but also Medicare & other democratic social programs
You know CNN gave Bernie the Commie questions beforehand. Cruz is champion debater. Bernie the Commie can't compete w/o help.
if only bernie was communist
@CNN Cruz is A traitor and an idiot. 2018 Texas!
It's going to hurt Teddy!
@CNN lying ted
Bernie Sanders couldn't crack a smile if his life dependent on it, let alone the American people
Bernie is the biggest prick in the Senate. Wouldnt even talk to supporters/shake hands. He doesnt give 2 phucks about ppl
Why CNN? Why not someone reputable?
@CNN  can't wait to see what communist sanders has to say!!! Look at Venezuela!! Socialism don't work!!


Goofus v Gallant

The bern..
@CNN this is going to be awesome
most boring debate ever
What's the point of it now? Like it or not, Obamacare is on the way out. Best to discuss what's taking its place, no?
