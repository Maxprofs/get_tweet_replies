@SenTedCruz @jstines3 stealing Rubio line
@indiegop @SenTedCruz Not RUBIO, REAGAN! It is a Reagan quote!
@jstines3 true that.  Forgot.  Thank you.  Then they should cite him.
@indiegop I worked in Reagan's Campaign Headquarters and in his admin -- there is little he has said that I haven't committed to memory!
@SenTedCruz LOL....I just saw that strategy on a bumper sticker. "We win, they lose".
@Freefree0Bobbie @SenTedCruz
Well he's just trying to communicate on the level that some people think-
Actually he has laid out specifics B4
@SenTedCruz I'd love to know Hillary ' s unique strategy,  but as with all things Hillary, the media deemed them unmentionable.
@SenTedCruz Is that the Strategy against Trump?  Because, you are losing.
@SenTedCruz Great answer which I think serves as a homage to one @newtgingrich gave in the last primary cycle's debates.
@SenTedCruz How about, you start by voting for an updated AUMF?
#DoYourJob
@MariaLiaCalvo @SenTedCruz The AUMF Obama has is as legitimate today as it was the first day he decided to use it.
@SenTedCruz @903GaGa  You're getting new consideration from me because you didn't join the lefties in piling on after Trump misrepresented.
So simple that it's meaningless. #GOP for morons ➤ @SenTedCruz
Our strategy with radical Islamic terrorism should be very simple. We win. They lose. 
@SenTedCruz Why can't You accept that some people don't want Your emails anymore. I don't still get them... #SPAMMER
@SenTedCruz  YEP that will do it.  Can you get any more fucking stupid!  And by the way can I see your  birth certificate?  #canadian
@SenTedCruz 
Thank God
You cleared up the error Fox made on where you stand on this issue!
@SenTedCruz This...vapid? Vague? Ugh...I mean, The War On Drugs would have been won by now if we were just a bit tougher on it. 
@SenTedCruz @ChadGourley79 same strategy guess like the Republican Party use Here Too! Huh
@kennerly_thomas @SenTedCruz Got me there.
@SenTedCruz TEAM WORK GOING ON HEAR FOR SURE";  )
@SenTedCruz I see you learned a lot at your fancy finishing schools.
@SenTedCruz What's the strategy?
@SenTedCruz oh do tell!
@SenTedCruz Absolute genius! You're a modern-day Clausewitz.
@SenTedCruz ISIS has "take backs" they just used one and said they r winning. what ur move?
@SenTedCruz "Very simple." The only terms that your  followers can possibly understand. #idiots
@SenTedCruz Islam, like every other idolatry is an enemy of the truth.
@SenTedCruz @ChasFlemming you took Rick Perry's tax Plan, Marcos immigration Plan and Rick Perry's mail in tax card, what have you done?NADA
@SenTedCruz  Cool story bro.
@SenTedCruz You are mistaking simplistic with simple and they are not the same.
@SenTedCruz Gee, that's a great plan, if you're playing Scrabble. I know your followers are too dumb to understand anything more complex tho
@UCareWhatIThnk @SenTedCruz Do you really think he's dumb? Really?
@thebowtieboys @SenTedCruz I didn't say he was. I said his followers are. Read better. It's not hard, very few words.
@SenTedCruz That is the most asinine statement yet. Why don't you grow up? You sound like you're still in elementary school.
@SenTedCruz Very Reaganesqe. Vapid, vague, ridiculous platitudes that mean nothing to any thinking human. Shades of Reagan indeed.
@SenTedCruz Stupid is as stupid does.
.@SenTedCruz Even Isis laughs at you!
@SenTedCruz Golly, so simple you'd think someone would have thunk it before. (You are a nincompoop)
@SenTedCruz wow...what a strategy... I'm impressed... Not. 
@SenTedCruz and your strategy is? #tedcruzisamoron
@SenTedCruz @DocWashburn Vp in action
@SenTedCruz @rushlimbaugh @marklevinshow @DRUDGE_REPORT The 1952,Immigration & Naturalization Act prohibits a Totalitarian ideology.
@SenTedCruz @dennygirltwo vague.. they are here, encrypted, connected, what's next?
@SenTedCruz @Lizbethjoy and gloves off media stay home
@SenTedCruz 
US code title 8 sec 1182
@SenTedCruz That's about it, yeah...
@SenTedCruz win when?
@SenTedCruz like that we win they lose
@SenTedCruz That isn't a strategy. That's a wish. You're clueless Ted. Or more like Clueless Ted.
@SenTedCruz How many more lives lost before we learn a lesson?  You should stand with Trump 
http://conservativepost.com/thomas-jeffersons-response-to-muslims-in-1801-is-more-important-today-than-ever/ …
@SenTedCruz True. Unfortunately, the left has transformed USA into a pussified country. What happened 2home of the brave & land of the free.
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis We won't win if we become obsessed further with PC over common sense and self-protection.
@SenTedCruz so simple its . . . .not even a strategy at all. I can't vote for someone who doesn't know the meaning of common words.
@SenTedCruz simple if you're a simpleton!
@SenTedCruz is that hand coming up at the end pointing out what "strategy" means?
@SenTedCruz Where do you stand on Radical Christian Terrorism?
@SenTedCruz Because life is simple!
@SenTedCruz This rolls off the tongue well. You don't say how your would accomplish this.  Trump does.
@SenTedCruz teddy, keep up great work, rockin' in the polls and pissing off the dim tards, You're the ultimate left troll bait #tcot #tlot
@SenTedCruz 

Excellent State leadership. #TexasStrong.
@SenTedCruz // Are you in 2nd grade?!. That's not a strategy. ..It's a bloody slogan!.
@SenTedCruz ummm... Is that a strategy?? A four word policy??
@SenTedCruz  That's not a strategy, Senator .  Little League teams have better plans than that simple tripe.
@SenTedCruz @CathyTo47590555 take that, main stream media! lol
@SenTedCruz That's just stoopid DUMB.
@SenTedCruz Well holy shit. Why didn't anyone else think of that? #Genius
@SenTedCruz and u think Obama just decided to lose? I realize u aren't a fan but you sound like a child
@SenTedCruz You try to position yourself as being more reasonable than @realdonaldtrump. But you're just as evil.
@SenTedCruz what a cot dam genius.
@SenTedCruz We don't win by pandering to them.  Look at Europe, that is our future under Kum Ba Yah PC politics.  Time to close the door.
@SenTedCruz Will you put on your fighting bathrobe for that, Sen. Creepy?
@SenTedCruz you are incredibly stupid
@SenTedCruz Thank you for your Leadership I have never been more disappointed in our Gov't. Tired of disappointment vote for Ted Cruz
@SenTedCruz Obama has let this country down. He should have taken these steps to protect our nation.
@SenTedCruz we win they lose is not a strategy
@SenTedCruz You forgot the part about clear eyes and full hearts. And you call yourself a Texan?
@SenTedCruz wrong
@SenTedCruz How does one get into @Princeton w/o knowing how to define #Solution ? 
@SenTedCruz wait we want to win at terrorism?? #banallpoliticians
@SenTedCruz the only appropriate response to that is this
@SenTedCruz Senator, I have a 1-point plan to help execute your "strategy": pack your bags & hop on the next flight to Dabiq #GOP #Idiocracy
@SenTedCruz That's not a strategy.
@SenTedCruz YES, LOVE IT!!  And LOOK at the TROLLS GALORE, LOLLL!!  Just SHOWS U R on the absolute RIGHT TRACK!  
#CruzCrew #CRUZn2Victory
@SenTedCruz Yeah, I'm not sure if you're familiar with what the word "strategy" means or not, but that's not a strategy.
@SenTedCruz Then don't invite the enemy to share our bed!! @realDonaldTrump is right! #refugeecrisis is a #trojanhorse!
@SenTedCruz that's a goal not a strategy. Strategy is HOW we win.
@SenTedCruz @iD4RO Isn't that the same strategy they employed with a handful of commie Vietnamese dirt-farmers??
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz yes I agree we should Do Good Things instead of Not Doing Good Things.
@SenTedCruz Americans that are pushing against the turmoil Muslims & Islamic are causing are praised those 4them are not in their Rite Mind.
@Jonalist @SenTedCruz Is English your first language? Because that is just babbling.
@SenTedCruz that was a weak response ted.. cmon you gotta say more than that. 
@SenTedCruz If you were smart you'd just say you were going to have ISIS pay to build a wall. And then you'd propose a plan to arm toddlers.
@SenTedCruz That isn't a strategy. It's a desired outcome dressed up as a sound bite.
@SenTedCruz I am forwarding this to ISIS command. I expect they will surrender tomorrow
@SenTedCruz Hint Hint Communist are backing Muslims plus the future Muslim Union & ISIS Bitcoin as a key ingredient to their worldwide $cash
@SenTedCruz you can't be as clueless as you act, wait maybe you are, one thing is clear if you win GOP nominee dems win GOP losses
@SenTedCruz .
@SenTedCruz Same as my powerball strategy.
@SenTedCruz great plan we call them losers they get upset and they go home! Great plan Raffe
@SenTedCruz Ted, that’s also my strategy for the Atlanta Braves and their opponents in 2016

@SenTedCruz How long did it take you to come up with that gem?
.@SenTedCruz I think we need a "Sponsor" VISA Program that allows 5yr US Citizens to sponsor a VISA Applicant. Both would be vetted.
Is this a parody account? @SenTedCruz
Our strategy with radical Islamic terrorism should be very simple. We win. They lose. 
@dbfulton - He might want to look up the meaning of the word "strategy." He seems to be confusing it with "outcome".
.@SenTedCruz Is this a spoof account?
@MushyMelbowHead @SenTedCruz I think he's trying to reach his NRA base, so keeping his message really, really, really simple
@troovus @SenTedCruz Even I can't understand it?
@MushyMelbowHead @SenTedCruz he's heading towards the Blair limit, one-word sentences!
.@SenTedCruz This is to strategy what Napoleon Dynamite is to Napoleon
@SenTedCruz To be fair he has to use simple words and phrases so his pea brained supports can understand. smart people know that's no plan.
@sentedcruz Let me guess: You think the Cowboys should run the “score a touchdown” play more often, right?
.@SenTedCruz You forgot "2. ???"
.@SenTedCruz "we will beat Hitler by beating him until he's been beaten by our beating. Bacon, America, Jesus."
@SenTedCruz this sounds like the movie script for Walker The Texas Ranger
@SenTedCruz Did you craft this strategy on the playground?
yo @SenTedCruz this isn't a strategy, it's a pep talk from a little league coach who is seriously phoning it in.
@SenTedCruz I have two words for you senator. Hell yeah!
@SenTedCruz "You're fucking out, I'm fucking IN!" --President Kenny Powers
@SenTedCruz - We win, when you lose, Ted.
@SenTedCruz WHY DIDN'T OBAMA THINK OF THE WE WIN YOU LOSE STRATEGY?!?!?!?
@SenTedCruz moron!
@SenTedCruz Do you want Muslims controlling your damned live when American Unions cannot compete in the Stock Market any longer: WAR IS NOW!
@SenTedCruz Oh FFS.
@SenTedCruz My strategy for winning the war is to win all the battles...You can't win the game if you don't score... #Genius
@SenTedCruz both forms of Insurance is opposed by Muslims so that $$ will end up going to their Muslim USA Union & it shall grow big+bigger.
@SenTedCruz @SteveSGoddard That's not a strategy. That's my hope regarding University of Georgia football. Can we get serious?
@SenTedCruz Thank goodness we have you on the case, Sen Cruz. A real deep thinker this one.
@SenTedCruz @ChasFlemming @marcorubio Rubio said that a month ago, why do you copy peoples talking points? you can not think for yourself?
@forrickperry It is a direct quote from Ronald Reagan. Marco said "Either they win or we win,"  a similar thought. @SenTedCruz @marcorubio
@SenTedCruz Ted can we put u and the people u associate on terrorist watch list..because when u call for HC providers to be murdered+gays..
@SenTedCruz sounds like the same thing #GeorgeWBush would say and look how great THAT turned out
@SenTedCruz Poor Ted, doesn't understand the word strategy.
@SenTedCruz  should be fairly easy to implement and execute... Surprised no one has tried it
@SenTedCruz If you have never saw Obama stand up till now for Muslims, its cause as ex-Prez he can invest a future payroll+ too MUSLIMS USA.
@SenTedCruz says the man who says Hillary has been to militaristic, when in realty its the opposite
“@SenTedCruz: Our strategy with radical Islamic terrorism should be very simple. ” welp, u got me there, Cruz
@abouttjim @SenTedCruz that hand thrown up was mine
@Tannerj502 @SenTedCruz "Mr. Cruz, Im Tanner Holmes. Question: do you understand the definition of 'strategy?'"
@abouttjim @SenTedCruz I'm fucking Tanner Holmes, do you understand.,?!'
@SenTedCruz you use the word “strategy” but I don’t think you understand what that means
@SenTedCruz Muslims are in America forming their own Union to root off MADE IN AMERICA to MUSLIMS USA PRODUCTS a financial ISIS Bitcoin ruin
@SenTedCruz Troops to the Middle East, right!
@SenTedCruz That wasn't dumbed down quite enough for people who like you for president. Still too complex. Try again.
@SenTedCruz are you wearing lipstick?
@SenTedCruz now that’s profound foreign policy! Now I see why the idiots follow you like sheep.
@SenTedCruz OK. But where's the strategy?
AMEN @SenTedCruz "to use a football angology here" we win by keeping them out of our endzone, #GrassrootsRising #Victory
@SenTedCruz easy for an armchair patriot who never served to say. Go back to Canada.
@SenTedCruz I thought you were the smart one?
@SenTedCruz PART OF THAT STRATEGY SHOULD BE TO DISALLOW PEOPLE FROM MUSLIM COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN TERRORISM!!!!
@SenTedCruz How do you purpose winning?  What's your plan?
@SenTedCruz are you 7 years old? That's in noway a strategy. Next step is we are rubber they are glue
@SenTedCruz Where are your citizenship papers?
@SenTedCruz WOW! Why didn't anyone else think of this?!!??

#Leadership
@SenTedCruz this is why nobody likes you
@SenTedCruz and just what do we win and they lose?
@SenTedCruz that's called an objective, not a strategy. You went to Harvard?
@SenTedCruz Brilliant !! Curious if you stayed up all night to come to that conclusion?
@SenTedCruz Hey Einstein, "winning" is not a strategy, its an objective or result. You clearly have no strategy.
@SenTedCruz just like cake and ice cream.
@SenTedCruz nonsense. Not a strategy but an aim. Strategy is what gets you to that result.
@D2_Derpinator @SenTedCruz glad he included the video
@bflip33 @D2_Derpinator @SenTedCruz It's a pretty complex strategy that requires deep thought and explanation
@SenTedCruz All I would say to is unite with @realdonaldtrump, with you as president of senate. That unity will CRUSH DC cartel!
@SenTedCruz Deep thoughts
@SenTedCruz I like how you're tone copies Trump.
@SenTedCruz Why has no one, ever, anywhere thought of this stunningly cunning plan b4?
@SenTedCruz I always thnk the GOOD guys should win & the bad guys should lose! It's GOD's way.
@SenTedCruz simple fool! you always will lose!
@SenTedCruz but what is YOUR actual STRATEGY? it is easier watching the Super Bowl than coaching in one... YOUR STRATEGY.. Sir?
@SenTedCruz This is simple.  Unfortunately it's not a strategy.
@SenTedCruz I'm all for the good guys winning over the bad guys, but how is that a strategy?
.@SenTedCruz That is a sweet plan! And they'll agree to it because our God is an awesome God
@SenTedCruz I'm surprised any number of sports teams haven't called to offer you a coaching job.
@SenTedCruz full of wisdom
@SenTedCruz  when will you pass the Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act #WORSTRESONDERS #brokenpromises
@sentedcruz Why don't you people ever ask what the voters want?  No re-elections in the future! U  don't care about us and/or safety!
@SenTedCruz @FoxNews : I love his deep thought on the subject
@SenTedCruz This isn't a strategy. It's a desired outcome. Everyone wants this.
@DanielYRubin @SenTedCruz thanks Daniel...you nailed it.
