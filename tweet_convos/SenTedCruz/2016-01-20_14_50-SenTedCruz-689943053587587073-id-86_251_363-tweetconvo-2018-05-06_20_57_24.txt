We cannot make the mistake of extending our generosity to the extent of imperiling the safety & security of the USA 
@SenTedCruz  It's like 1 of 3 things demanded of the president in the constitution. Why is it so hard?
@johnstropparo @SenTedCruz You are not electable.  New poll today shows only Marco Rubio can beat Hillary.  Not YOU  TODAY
@ParrotCaique @SenTedCruz  Hillary has bigger problems like future grand jury proceedings into her emails and Benghazi. She's done.
@johnstropparo @SenTedCruz hold ur breath and hope. Cruz losing to Hillary 47% to 41% poll released today. he's extreme.
@ParrotCaique @SenTedCruz   Hillary is main stream though.
@johnstropparo Nope it shows Rubio does the best/wins against Hillary. Not seen as divisive. Not as loony.
@ParrotCaique progressive against communist.That's  safer. Divisive isn't the worst thing when the congress and fed is out of control.
@johnstropparo don't win.  just whine
@SenTedCruz @CatherineABird I'm so mad at @FoxNews they pushing @marcorubio who isn't even close to @tedcruz or @realDonaldTrump #foxnews
@bryboone, @FoxNews is just another biased MSM news org; but they're biased 4 the establishment/progressive @GOP, not 4 fixing the U.S.
@bryboone @FoxNews @GOP 1st, Fox endorsed Jeb Bush, but he was unpopular. They'll endorse #Trump over @TedCruz.
@CatherineABird @FoxNews @GOP @tedcruz they pushing off @marcorubio they were even trying best to confuse Rubio 2nd 2 TRUMP he not evenClose
@CatherineABird @FoxNews @GOP #FOXNEWS hates to even bring up @tedcruz - they try to confuse last poll Rubio DEM was 13 %
@tedcruz honestMan
@bryboone @FoxNews @GOP @tedcruz The fact they avoid mentioning #Cruz reveals they're part of the #WashingtonCartel of corruption. #CruzCrew
@CatherineABird @bryboone i think theyre scared to mention him because it might not be legal for him to run. He was born in canada
@bluemage3 @bryboone John McCain was born in PANAMA (a country, not a U.S. city), yet no one mentioned it when he ran 4 prez TWICE. Why?
@SenTedCruz @songbirdcd  Sooner than later! obama admin fails to protect us. Secure border. Build fence NOW! @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump

@SenTedCruz is this what Gore means when he says inconvenient truth? We must know who refugees are.

@SenTedCruz sorry dude "we gon build a wall" sounds better and gets votes
@SenTedCruz people want to hear the rule of law will be upheld, hillary in jail, holder in jail 4 fast & fur. & defend the constitution
@SenTedCruz Just words, just like Ryan..means nothing- sayin what people want to hear CRUZ is a neocon/globalist and so is his wife CFR
@SenTedCruz we should've sealed off Canada before you were born.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump Yes, tell us how handing out soccer balls and teddy bears to criminals who broke our laws accomplishes that?
@SenTedCruz basic steps are you kidding that why we need trump he is willing to take major steps to keep us safe TRUMP 2016

@SenTedCruz so I wonder if Obama will bail out Hillary for her crimes?  Why is she not arrested by now?
@SenTedCruz was a trump fan until he started lying about Cruz.  Who really cares about Palin any more?  Trump probably offered her money
@SenTedCruz these days everyone is called a racist anyways so may as well be safe and not import terrorists.  Help them there and not here
@SenTedCruz start out by how you do business with others #dialogue #ego
@SenTedCruz https://youtu.be/9G42rmPvbbU 
@SenTedCruz I agree and the Senate needs to do something about it over and above 'talking' about it.
@SenTedCruz I know, send you home.
@SenTedCruz Take out another loan from Goldman Sachs and build your own wall

Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee...
@SenTedCruz Don't be surprised when Cruz supports candidates willing 2polygraph yrly 2protect office from political corruption!
@SenTedCruz Exactly why America will elect Trump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@SenTedCruz damn right Ted!! Tighten up that border we need to stop those damn Canadians!!!!
@SenTedCruz Didn't Congress already pass a bill to build the border wall? What's left but to dust it off and fund it? #CruzCrew
@SenTedCruz 
Have you made it to Washington in the past year to vote on any bill before congress? You know, like you were hired to do?
@SenTedCruz how long have you been in office and what have you http://done.ZIP  ,NODA,NOTHING,JUST LIKE THE REST.
@SenTedCruz what that wasn't included with a trillion dollars on security really or is it a little less.
@SenTedCruz 
Charles Manson is probably available for an endorsement now that Sarah Palin is taken.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz why not  America needs some Islamic  rape  squads,you know like what they have in Europe theses days...
@SenTedCruz Cruz will never win because he is just hated by darn near everyone in his own party and beyond!
@SenTedCruz basic steps? like dressing in camouflage and hanging with the anti-intellectual, bigoted duck dynasty guy?
@SenTedCruz closing the border is easy I know millions of rednecks that'll help
