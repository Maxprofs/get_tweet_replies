Fake Fake #Apollo11 Hoax Bullshit.
haters will say it's fak
Since you've totally upstaged anything I can do for our anniversary today, any chance you can wish my wife a happy anniversary?
You, Neil and Mike are the greatest Explorers on this Planet. Wish you all good Things on this World and beyond.
@natnewbury
Happy 47 #Apollo11!
one of the highlights of my childhood
God bless you sir for your service
So you just sailed through Van Allen Radiation Belt? You are a Bullshit Artist of the highest order #Apollo11 Moon Landing Fake
Thank you, Mr.Aldrin. Your courage is still an inspiration.
so cool!
I remember that day very well.  I was 9 when the first spacecraft was launched. My school stood still. So very proud
I met him 20 years ago. Even when he's not talking, his personality fills a room. @TheRealBuzz @_hatman
I stayed up all night to watch on TV, history in the making.
I hear that. I kept going outside to look at the moon & run back inside. @_hatman @TheRealBuzz
And I watched Neil & Mike take a stroll on that moon on TV here in Perth. (I didn't remember seeing the coke bottle thou)
Mike never set foot on the moon. Only Neil and Buzz did. @TheRealBuzz
half right but none of them did
@USA_WINGMAN Congratulations! An incredible moment, followed by others – the whole planet was agog.
Yes I remember the blast off & landing so well! "One step for man, one giant leap for mankind". Loved it!
Not many of us that remember the actual event!
You might be surprised – everyone in my circle of friends certainly does.
I sounded like the "Get off My Lawn" guy huh..
One didn't need to be a "space buff" in order to appreciate it.
It was a major event for us as a family!
4 mine, as well, on both sides. I was engaged that summer, was watching it w/my prospective in-laws.
@lizacoyle I wasn't even born. My mum was 8 and my dad 20...

I feel like a baby 
my mum would've been 2 yrs old! 
Shows how old my parents are 
and the smartphone (that I assume) you have in your hand is more powerful than computers on that mission
@SiliconShecky
the caculator watch I had on my wrist in the 80s was more.powerful.
@SiliconShecky @TheRealBuzz
@facebook @finkd I just want access to my account. Tell me who to contact.
My father was a gyroscopic engineer for Northrop (kept your X,Y,Z in order).  The gyros where cigarette lighter size on Apollo
long may you ride, Buzz!
you'll be using lame meme soon. Are you being conditioned at church to post this stuff?
that was actually a gif
I'm not actually trying to reach u as that is impossible, your path is set. I can give u lots of proof but it's pretty pointless
believing the earth is flat is make believe Ford, try this https://youtu.be/hsOz_J6tJVU 
happy moon-iversary!  Thank you for your brave curiosity and willingness to allow us to share in your adventuring!  #science
@DavidPepper the right stuff!
@DesHoughton and I came home from hospital as a new born. Dad was busy watching TV though!
Happy anniversary
@Rubybeets I was on the beach & watched. Sister worked there in summer. She taught school on Merritt Island in Winter
@hmkyale what did that ride feel like
@Eddie_Klein3 Klein3    1969 Army AIT Ft Sill, OK
I was 9 when the moon landing happened!
Once, man walked on the Moon
@TheRealBuzz @badwolf303
we should be there now.
I miss Space 1999 show
We were such hopeful then
Dreamt of such futures
@badwolf303 @TheRealBuzz
@elonmusk real men!
Thank you!!
I've seen the Saturn 5 at @NASAKennedy. Can't believe you guys were crazy enough to ride on this gigantic fuel tank! #Apollo11
I walked along that orange walkway which is now at the Kennedy Space Centre. It was pretty awesome
@pogatch44 lies - all lies -a Hollywood stunt
Thank you Sir and thank you for making New Jersey proud!
@NotJackKemp any thoughts on this anniversary Jake? @SportsSturm
NO!
The world seemed a hopeful place back then. Yes we had wars, civil rights etc - but it has deteriorated since 1969.
SaturnV! What a ride! 8 million pounds of thrust and computing power less than today's smart phone. #bravemenindeed
Amazing..what a legacy to the stars and beyond on constant repeat..keep well Spaceman x x x
Still one of the coolest thing mankind has ever done!  We'll done Sir!
@ProfBrianCox remember it like yesterday! Still overwhelms me. Weather pretty much the same too!
@ElaineYoung94 Still man kinds greatest achievement 
@elonmusk see you on Saturday Buzz! Looking forward to the dinner
Buzz, you're a shining member of a dying tribe of remaining genuine heroes--heroes fuel dreams.  Mine included @TheRealBuzz @steveterrell
one or the most important events of the last century
Hey Bruce. You well?
@elonmusk yup andcit was round real and 300k ish miles away. But you knocked down the flag to go back andcput itcright
@AlexKalogiannis great time on that day.....
as you took your first steps on the moon, I was taking my first steps on earth.
@a_paranjpye We too, cherish those memories...
The peak of USA. I struggle to find any accomplishment since as impressive. Saturn V was a hoss.
many moons ago :-) @TheRealBuzz @NoonanJoe
I salute you, Sir! Thank you, Mike and Neil for making this happen. I honour the #Apollo11 plaque at home
@Astro_Wakata 
I watchd this ,when I was 15years old.  It was Very Fantastic incident.
Was sitting in back yard in a little town in FL not far from there watching. AWSOME BIG ROCKET IT WAS!
@ProfBrianCox Astronauts are incredibly brave  exploring new frontiers! Watched it at school. We all stopped ..mesmerized.
@elonmusk Thank you so much!!!!!!!
@BTYSTE Thanks for being such an inspiration.  BTW, did you know there is a crater on the moon named after George Boole?
which was a great thing !! Thx ! I watched it at TV with my parents as a 4 year old. Today I wait for the next step :)
REALLY?
@ClancyReports yeah right and how did they manage to leave the moons atmosphere?
@phxsunil Happy Happy Anniversary!! 
@Lordphilipwalsh so cool
- Many of still carry that excitement.
@soozanderson4 That was back when we had real leaders who believed in USA innovation!
Thanks for giving the world a dream. I remember exactly where I was this day.
i wanted so much to be the one going to the moon. yes, a girl could dream. thank you for giving me a dream that i still have.
to infinity and beyond... @TheRealBuzz  man who walked on the face of the moon...
I remember. My parents had my sister & I sleep on the couch, then woke us up 
Or filmed it in an airplane hanger in the middle of the Nevada desert..
Thank you! You've inspired generations.
photo credit: the 8th astronaut, Ralph Morse.
47 years ago Kubrick took you to Hollywood
Its been too long.
American exceptionalism.  I remember it well.
@SenTedCruz You surely did. Made history.
@jack @nasa @elijahwood If only the human being can to return in the future to the space and repeat this moment in some planet.
@jack @nasa @elijahwood That moment,was one of the best of all the history.
very cool
wow! Amazing! Can't believe how many idiots came out over that tweet, Idiocracy  is real..
@Chris_Bittle 
I sat glued to the TV watching this mission!
A magical time!
BIG HONOR to you, Neil, Mike...APOLLO MISSIONS opened me to SPACE and 2 most powerful words in my life: WHAT IF?
You're like Howard Waalowich.  What have you done recently, Buzz?
Shaking in your boots?
....with excitement.
@Nasa Would be an interesting experiment to tweet events as if the we happening in real time from launch to return. #Apollo11
and it wrang like a bell?
@BarryJWoods I was nine. You three were my heroes, although I felt sorry for Michael - stuck in the ship while you two had fun.
@elonmusk and the whole world watched. We all need that again.
https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LMInspection5389-93plus96-99.jpg … Looking good! @TheRealBuzz
Why no one go back mate ? What was there that made everyone repel from the moon?
greatest people still are life brave..
Original Apollo 11 Guidance Computer (AGC) source code for the command and lunar modules.
@TheEddChina did they land on Hollywood?
@elonmusk still holds the record for the furthest any human has ever travelled. Well done and can't wait for the next adventure
we deserve to know, must
Your tweet makes my page better: http://rbl.ms/29NV5Mo 
@pululando Y 3 días después, yo, con 5 años recién cumplidos lo vi todo en la TV.   ;-))
@mikeasewell, and I was born that day, the hospital wanted to call me Apollo or Lunar!
When will mankind finally get around to colonizing the moon?
who's going next?
Montclair !!!  Thanks Buzz!!
@MrDavidHobbs as mr Hobbs would say. That took some large attachments to do that 
@Prayformetoo America can no longer do the math to get to the moon.
@Prayformetoo America probably couldn't do it today. We lost our brains, our science, our manufacturing, our cohesiveness.
@drjaydeepsarma To be in a position to write this #tweet True #legend @TheRealBuzz
#moonandback #awesomemoments
Moon landing -The 1st time I stayed up all night,glued to tv. 9yo
. @TheRealBuzz @Teirersias In my deepest throes of alzheimer's I will NOT forget Apollo 11!
and I watched it! :-0 @KrisParonto
God Bless You !
Absolutely the achievement of a century, still incredible. Was always envious of the engineers who had that challenge.
You are a true hero! Your name will never be forgotten, it's carved in stone.
8

99
We will never forget it!
@SNAXBOOGIE  Buzz the 'Lightyear' Aldrin u the BEST! 
I was 8. Watched from launch to splashdown. I envy you sir.
Congrats to you, Mike, and #BoilerUp for Neil! @WassonENT @PurdueFoundry
so....did ya all see aliens up there or not? I think it has been long enough for you to be able to answer this question. : )
No you didn't!
@BBCClick and still heroes! That started so much for our generation. Thank you so much!
false
Truly the sky isnt the limit. Here's to 47 and more years of exploring this wonderful cosmos.
a Proud moment in History sir #brave
Thank you, Buzz, for all you did and all you continue to do. We still need you!
47 years ago the hoax began!
allegedly?
What are your plans for the 50th?
@JohnNicholRAF I remember it well, I was flying to West Germany and watched the whole thing in Koln with a German soundtrack
I remember! You are a true hero and have lived your life on Earth with real dignity.
heck #yeahyoudid !!!
Happy Anniversary!
The one thing that brought the world close together
@LivGracefully 
Buzz, may ask you a question. Who was the one to put the camera on the surface?!?!?!?!?!
the camera was attached to the ship
SEEMS LIKE A COVER UP
Exciting times. The world seems to have lost its way since then.
perhaps, or perhaps we just hype everything nowadays!
awesome.., I was 14 at that time...
Happy Anniversary to a true hero!
@JoanneWiggyG Heroes!!
Wow!  Time &  rockets fly!  I miss the awe and excitement of the space program!  God bless you and your  fellow  astronauts!
happy anniversary & thank you!
Apollo missions were the most romantic times of the space age. Happy anniversary Mr.Aldrin
congrats ayya from Tamil indian.
@skystephen ya big liar, buzz. Never happened. Space maybe the final frontier, but it's made in s Hollywood basement
We watched holding our breath and in prayer. That remained the case throughout your near fatal voyage.
Quite a ride.
Unfortunately I was behind the Iron courtain and didn't hear a word about this great achievement of America ingenuity.
happy  anniversary !!!
you and your colleagues inspired a generation! Happy anniversary.
Your courage remains unmatched, you are a real hero, an American hero. May God bless you.
#InsideJob
A day to remember. I was in Vietnam cheering you guys on
@elonmusk 
And I remember it well.
Thanks. That was one of the best days of my childhood
incredible!
"built by the lowest bidder"
Thank you sir, for you service! I was 11 and amazed by all of the thoughts of space travel & adventure.
most memorable event happy anniversary.
Loved that Day Sir and thankyou for the autograph at Hutch ks
@marcthiessen one of my earliest memories!  #toinfinityandbeyond
@GodzWorld HOW QUICKLY THE WORLD FORGETS.
Congratulations! @TheRealBuzz we learned about your incredible ride in grade5 science many years later. It's an honour to connect here. 
and a legend was made. Thank you for taking the risk.
except you didn't
And now you're duplicating the Xenu story to Body Thetans in Scientology. #HowTheMightyHaveFallen
So you say, anyway 
one of the few great memories I have of the 20 century. Thankyou for helping me to look beyond my horizon.
well there's only 2 other people that can meet that boast ... at least I got to watch it live. Thanks for that!
this blows my mind every time I think about it.
I remember it like yesterday! You (and all the other astronauts) are brave, courageous, heroes! Thank you all!
how is Neil doing ?? @roopak999
yeah you did!
.@TheRealBuzz I remember Cronkite slurring his words as Neil stepped onto the moon, he & Schirra had been up all night, maybe for days.
Happy Anniversary Buzz!!
oh no you didunt :-)
No they didn't. #lies #conspiracy
felicidades !!!!!
if this picture is real?
Happy Anniversary from Houston @NASA_Johnson
how can this be?
Happy Anniversary!
