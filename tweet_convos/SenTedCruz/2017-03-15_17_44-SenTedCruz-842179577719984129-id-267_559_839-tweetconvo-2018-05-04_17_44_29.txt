You owe it to the voters to listen to them and remember that they don't all agree with that promise.
You owe it to the voters to not fly in half-cocked with a plan set to deprive millions of healthcare access.

That's nice. I demand they not allow insurance companies to double the cost my dad pays for health--
That's Obama's fault
Incorrect. He couldn't afford insurance before ACA. Repealing and passing AHCA would cost him dearly.
And since he works with heavy equipment, not being insured could kill him.
JUST HAV ANOTHR VOTE ON  ONE YOU ALL VOTED FOR A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT WAS SIMPLE REPEAL OBAMASCAM
had you passed the less than desirable bill you could have gotten the additional improvements needed.
REPEAL IT TODAY! #PassTheBill
THEN VOTE YES & SHOW WE ARE UNITED. IT CAN BE FIXED IN SENATE. WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE.
more talk. No action. Symbol of our party now. No chance of full repeal, this was something. Thx4nothing
neither Sen Cruz nor you were elected POTUS or majority leader; why help Hillary Clinton?
@FreedomWorks @SenTedCruz @WSJ We need to stop the "entitled" & teach work/responsibility.
Drive It Home Guys!  Fix it!  Repeal and Replace!  We have a lot of work to do!  Much to do!!!!

Cruz didn't make the stupid tactical error of killing reform before it began!  Ocare is killing us out here!
@FreedomWorks @SenTedCruz @WSJ The ONLY ones who should receive it r the disabled, seniors & poor. All others should pay.
@FreedomWorks @SenTedCruz @WSJ Completely repeal it & keep soros pigs out of the loop!
I have a big headache guys called the Freedom Caucus.
now what! I think messed up big time and Dems will end our with what they want single payor.
Can't believe how many "Conservatives" seem 2B falling4 this age old Establishment GOP ruse...  #pjnet. #ccot @repmarkmeadows @sentedcruz
...WIN, act like losers. Rinse, Repeat. Give Dems ObamaCare, Fortified w/cement & some minor improvmts... #pjnet @repmarkmeadows @sentedcruz
...CALL it "Repeal & Replace" & we're good.  I call it "ObamaRomneyBoehnerRyanMcConnellTrumpCare"  #pjnet #ccot @repmarkmeadows @sentedcruz

if you are a member of the Freedom Caucus, you are NOT serving the voters! So do tell!
Repeal. Then simply put poor on Medicaid, put us back where we were before Obamacare. Ins Co's lower costs
Less talk and more action. GOP talked about this for 7 years. Looking like a sorry excuse. Do something.
The voters didn't vote for this crap you're peddling. The electoral college did.
how does it feel to be on the side of Planned Parenthood?
SURTAX ON INCOME SNEAKED BACK INTO RYANCARE LAST NIGHT.  BETRAYAL! JUDASES!  MAY AS WELL VOTE FOR DEMS.
#ACA works for your constituents!
You promised your cronies to repeal ACA. The voters (look at polls nitwit) like and NEED the ACA.
@Pudingtane @SenTedCruz You all sure as hell haven't done a damn thing for 7 years. You owe us no more gridlock! MAGA!
@RTHTGakaRoland @SenTedCruz Kill 18,000 the first year. Yeah. That's the American way. Good going, Satan
Strong claim. Can you back that up with facts?
Look it up. You have the Internet.
I did. Looked up US Constitution. Says nothing about Feds handling health care
True, #FullRepeal of Obamacare. No #Trumpcare replacement. Get gov't out & costs down.
@ArtHauntsMe @RepMarkMeadows @SenTedCruz
What of the child who was born to a poor single mother? Should he be punished? There has to be something for him
Yes, but not thru the Feds
Well now we will see if you & TedCruz can truly lead and make something workable pass. If you fail by being rigid you make us all lose.
QUIT trying to make a law where there isn't one wanted or needed.  Cut healthcare loose to the FREE MARKET!!
Get it done.
It's MORE important that it is done right than done quick! Repubs will own this steaming pile once u touch it.
@billie_begley @SenTedCruz Thank you for being strong Mark! Now please slap the crap out of @reppittenger for me!
Repeal it.
Yes REPEAL it effective one yr from now. Tell Ins Co to start offering ins to buyers. #tcot @EveODestruction @RepMarkMeadows @SenTedCruz
The real hang up is what to do abt the insurance freebies, tho they wont admit that. @RandellMcDonal1 @RepMarkMeadows @SenTedCruz #tcot
They don't argue their insurance we provide them but what they can deny us! Crazy! MAGA!
Pray in Jesus name. Amen.
The majority of voters didn't vote for this or Trump and you know it.
LIARS you have all three houses and what will you say next time we tried go home or get it done
we need help with drug abuse, maternity and mental health.
we believed you that it was better to repeal, but it was lies. Fix what is wrong with ACA and move to taxes
Liars. This raises premiums strips health care. We know. We don't all watch Fox. Shame on u. Sorry 4 u.
It doesn't have to be perfect  - there are additional phases - we Americans are okay with it.  Pass it now
Than get it done. 
@RepMarkMeadows @SenTedCruz
Your Final Solution is to kill vulnerable Americans.
Meadows scared of another man. How do you look ur son in the eyes and say " always be a man and stand on principle. Weak man
Thank you for standing strong Congressman! ALL OC must go & free-market should replace, NOT sausage. #GetGovtOutOfHealthcare
folding like a wet lawn chair. How weak. Vote yes and prepare to hang your career. Weak!!
to overrule the parliamentarian on Obama's signature issue will destroy filibuster when dems have majority.
you cannot overrule the parliamentarian on an issue of this magnitude. Filibuster dead with dem majority
How Rich Gain & Poor Lose -TrumpCare https://nyti.ms/2nEi4DT 
Fixing healthcare is easy w/ no Congress approval needed. Simply #EnforceUSC15 against medical industry.
Some of that is good, lots of it is nonsense. You need to address price transparency, at minimum.
You owe us a step in the right direction. Support the bill and Support @realDonaldTrump !!!!
@FreedomWorks @SenTedCruz I stand with you.  #FullRepeal I wish my #KS reps would join you but Moran/Roberts/Jenkins R RINO
Yes!!  Keep up the fight!
@FreedomWorks @SenTedCruz @WSJ Support Rand Paul's plan, better than EVERYONE else's
And you owe lots to the Koch Bothers right Mark!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Koch Brothers = House Freedom Caucus
Well do it! The news is under reports or you guys are making Rep's look bad. Opposition doesn't require talent.
@AlexanderPayton @SenTedCruz @WSJ  I do NOT want to hear ur meaningless chatter!STARTING THE F*€《ING REPEAL PROCESS VOTE YES
FULL REPEAL ONLY AS PROMISED !! NO FIX, NO REPLACEMENT! GOVERNMENTNO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN PEOPLES HEALTH CARE
I respect you for holding your ground and looking out for your constituents.
I've read it. Ryan has BAMBOOZLED Trump!! Amend the bill without government intervention!!!
Hear us. The Ryan bill OBAMACARE 2.0 .No GOVERNMENT in HEALTHCARE!!!
Americans don't want GOVERNMENT IN OUR HEALTHCARE,THAT'S OBAMACARE !!! NO ENTITLEMENTS, CADILLAC TAX YOU
then fully Repeal Obamacare!! Give us HSA accounts and let us buy our own insurance and open across state lines!
DISUNITY is not from God but the enemy.I pray God's wisdom to fix #RepealAndReplace,UNITY of MIND
You owe it to us to listen to our voices. We want ACA improved, not replaced.
PLEASE compromise to pass this so you can move on to legislation to get the economy going again. Please.
Stick with conservatives on this...do not waiver...do not give in to Liberal Trump approach.
Amazing how all BELIEVE in the Five Rings of Care Health System but choose not TO SEE. 5RC will set you free.
Vote NO on Trumpcare, don't worry about his threat.  You're not going to be re-elected anyway.
Time for ideology is not now. Get to work and get Obamacare Repeal solved. You and Mark Meadows together.
Don't let trump blackmail you. BLOCK THE BILL.
don't be bullied by trumps ultimatum, millions of citizens respect your dedication.
So, instead of blabbering about it, Cruz should do it when it gets to the Senate instead of trashing the bill.
Are your insurance co. donors pulling your strings to defeat this? You FRAUD! Fix it in conference. Get the ball rolling!
No way to just repeal then figure out replace. Dems will win if people lose coverage and kiss majorities goodbye. Vote yes!
Tarheel proud.
Stay strong Mark.
people need better health care. NOT NO healthcare. Our people should be first priority
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Pres Trump read this. Ryan failing you.  Americans want these added to Mgrs amendment
I am a liberal and I have to say I found your comments today to be refreshingly honest!! Thank you!
#FullRepeal #Obamacare @FreeMarket NO entitlements! @freedomcaucus @RandPaul @RepDennisRoss @SenMikeLee
If they do not repeal Obamacare and opt not to investigate Hillary then Trumps 40% approval will drop to 25%
Exchange your votes for a doable amendment to the bill, and pass it. We want repeal and replace
Absolutely.  POTUS should not have called u out.
Go for it!
Confirm Neil; full repeal :D
Stand strong brothers.. My freshman rep, @Scotttaylorva got all wobbly today. We need #FullRepeal, not #RinoCare
Thank you for opposing Rynocare.  It is disastrous for those of us aged 50+.
Why not single payer? #ACA @TuesdaysToomey
NO repeal of AHCA #TrumpNoCare
Your promise should be to make things better, not worse!
Hold strong say no to Rinocare!
then bring your healthcare ideas to POTUS instead of allowing democrats to have a GOP feeding frenzy
Stand strong with @RandPaul and #repealobamacare Once and for all.
Don't kid yourself.  Your voters didn't understand that ACA= Obamacare.  They LOVE ACA.
And don't believe trump. If you vote for TRUMP ARE you WILL be voted out. We will make sure of it.
Don't worry about Trump's threat, he won't be around in 2018.
why do you NOT like the health care that Trump has layed out ?
Let it go to the Senate & fail because of Dems. We need tax reform!
Do NOT let Trump threaten you..He will not be in NC voting
repeal and replace with single payer. Its cheaper
NO REPEAL! Repeal only gives the very rich tax breaks. Affordable healthcare (not just access)should B a right!
Stomp on insurance companies. Don' let them call the shots. Put your feet down on them not we the people.
didn't the Freedom Caucus push Ryan as Speaker? Well suck it up and vote YES for AHCA
Government and corporate employment sponsor insurance is not based on rich poor sick or healthy young or old.
Thank you.
Please vote NO on the healthcare bill.
It's time to get behind the President.
Do you really think you and Ted Cruz can stand in the face of the Trump tidal wave? Good luck with that!
Keep your promises. Trump promised to protect Medicare, this bill guts it. Stand up to Ryan & Trump.
You are making a HUGE mistake if you derail this bill. Voters won't forget you betrayed the admin.
Then hold strong. This version is not the way to go. You owe it to your 50-64 yr old constituents. Don't sink us
WOW Trump threatened you today. Will you bend over and take it from him??
How? By throwing more than 24 million off health ins. and killing more than 17-29 thousand/yr? More $$ for rich?
Don't you dare derail this bill. We, the voters, will throw you out.
But now you're going to vote for this mess of a bill. Did you decide it would bring enough pain? Such a principled lawmaker!
Ha, big tough guy!  You and your fellow stooges are caving like a house of cards
you said you listen to your people regardless of consequences. Well?  When is your town hall scheduled? We wait!
You owe it to the voters to keep ALL of Trump's election promises to provide healthcare for EVERYONE
Here's our plan #trumpcare doesn't Care
Your replacement is an insult to Americans. While you're at it, stop trying to make school lunches unhealthier
You owe it to taxpayers to stop the trips to Maralago & TrumpTower security before you vote on budget cuts!
You owe it to the people to represent them by speaking and listening to them. Cruz is not your base - we are.
when you make bills & don't listen to  feedback, you are not our representative. Give us a chance to speak back!
@ncginny @SenTedCruz @WSJ I totally trust Ted Cruz! No FEDERAL GOV.! State's care for their own! Federal Gov.- Military
If you don't have a plan that offers me replacement insurance jan 2018... then leave me alone!!
You guys are so excited about repealing the ACA & making healthcare unaffordable for millions.
Did you get the price where you wanted please.I am A NY'ER IN BINGHAMTON NY, we have a very skinny income it dropped again this year. Older
@SpeakerRyan This makes since. #Rinocare does not
Mark, if all of Congress had to take the same insurance we all would backit
 
You owe it to the American people to care for all citizens, including children, people with disabilities and the elderly.
@missykenkel2 @SenTedCruz 
If U do not incld INCENTIVES 4 healthier living & DECENTIVES 4 Unhealthy living,NOTHING WILL WORK
AHCA devastates middle age to older working class people.  You are harming Trump/Republican voters. Do Not Pass
Thank you guys for doing a great job.
Vote NO on Ryancare.
Yes but with something different than what you have
REPEAL the ACA completely!!
The main criteria is 1) Keep Government Out of Our Insurance!
No one wants ACA to be repealed. Listen to the people not the party!
Uh, yeah we do. Never wanted it in the first place.
what is your plan for pre existing conditions?
Well it looks like both Dems & @GOP  figured out how to stick it to older, single income (<30K)  households
EXCELLENT analysis. God break the strongholds of control & confusion in Congress and set UNITY of MIND FREE.
2018 will be a bloodbath for republicans IF you pass Ryan's bill. It is garbage, kill it. NOT what you promised!
@realDonaldTrump AMA, AHA, AARP against this bill. Depletes Medicare, giveaway to Insurers & drug companies!
.@RepMarkMeadows @freedomcaucus @SenTedCruz tell @SpeakerRyan & GOP leadership the #AHCA does not meet the criteria. #NoAHCA #FullRepeal
ok across state lines will prove to be useless concept always sounds good no value ask insurers
#FullRepeal
I am your constituent and do NOT support repeal. You do not see the real human pain behind total repeal! I do, every day!
Not the responsibility of the Federal Govt
Arizona has direct pay parity and transparency rules that would further help goal #1 ARS 32-3216, ARS 36-347
.@RepMarkMeadows @jimdwrench @SenTedCruz prayers are with you! Stay strong. #Repeal, and then haggle on replace.
93 million people lost their plans because of Obamacare
 Nearly 10 times those who need to be on Medicaid
And what percentage actually ended up with better coverage. Such foolishness and ignorance.
talk to Potus. Ryan needs to listen to all find compromise. @realDonaldTrump is Not signing if it hurts us

You owe it to the people of WNC to take their health insurance away?
Mark Meadows appearance on @Morning_Joe was one for the ages. What a heartless, soulless person.
Over 70 plans offered on the NY exchange. It's working here. Fix your states
these maniac Republicans should get ideas from states like NY but they refuse
you make a good point.  They need to fix their state issues and make it work
Tell Ins Co's - if u don't offer ACA Ins in State, u can't sell employer plan
and replace with better, cheaper coverage for all...now all you got is a tax cut for rich
Mark Meadows and Ted Cruz will allow sick people to die or go broke. They are evil disgusting people.
Mark Meadows wants to destroy healthcare insurance in North Carolina.  He is evil and disgusting. Vote him out.
Mark Meadows on Mornings Joe just lamented the fact there aren't more high deductible plans offered. Huh?
@Morning_Joe why we allowing insurance co's to overcharge on ACA plans vs employer plans ? Explain plz
You owe it to the voters to make sure that they ALL have affordable—preferably free—health insurance. Do that!
Can you explain the constitutional requirement that says this?
