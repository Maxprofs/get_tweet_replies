Anthony @Scaramucci says @POTUS 'is on missile lock' to build border wall http://fxn.ws/2eE9tOG  
Idiot #2
Thumbs up.
Don't try to be funny - it's not your strong suit.  Stick to slimy and prejudiced... that's your sweet spot.
You know he's serious right?
We need to grab some of the drug runners with cash.
Also puttin a wall through Santa Elena canyon would be fairly pointless and ruin an excellent hiking area.
Would the wall have prevented the San Antonio truck deaths?  Hell NO!
Or let's not waste so much damn money on a useless wall
If people who broke into this country was stripped of ever being a citizen, they'd wait to come in legally.
God Bless you Ted Cruz! 
I've been saying "make El Chapo pay for the wall" for a long time!
If anybody can make him pay it's U
Ted Cruz!
I would go along with a $10 border crossing tax and a $10 money order and bank transfer fee.
Do we know where El Chappo is keeping his money?
We

Can't even get any of that $$ they got off all the other criminals' full assets,but El Chapo's idea FROM LAURA, would really work?
@SenTedCruz let's take it easy with all this confiscation stuff. #iamwithjeff except for the whole civil forfeiture thing.
C'mon. You're disgusting, but don't sink lower...it's not a contest between you and Trump.
End the exploitation of illegal aliens. Don't make them an entitlement for the agricultural ind . Complaints of labor shortages in CA .
Fixed by wages and benefits. Don't underestimate US labor. But compensate adequately. Small farmers do it daily. Not every job is sweat and
Dirt free. Private sector development of machinery has always helped farmers to lower labor input. Under compensated labor
Stifles these innovations. Enforcement of laws re illegal aliens stops advantage taking and abuse of our fellow humans
This is what you're focusing on today? What about healthcare that makes sense for everyone? #TrumpcareSucks
Am I the only one tired of providing better benefits to the poor than what I recieve ?
I don't have dental and vision ,but they do .
Seriously????  Who?
Wall is the stupidest idea for how to spend taxpayer money that has ever been invented for political gain.  Don't waste our money!
What is the plan for a  wall being built in Texas given the Rio Grande? Serious question. Please address in some forum. Thanks.
Make trump pay for it!
I love the idea Senator. Let's put this drug money to work. We should be doing that anyways!
Get it done - Ted!! You have the support of Texans.
No he doesn't . He is an idiot

No one is stopping Texas from building its own wall, if it wants to waste its own tax dollars.  #StatesRights
He doesnt have the money for it, neither do we, and I hear illegal immigration is occurring partly by tunnel anyway.
What's that Canadian word for "punchable face" again?
I almost don't HATE you Keep Going
You seem Like a man in  development
Love you Ted, support our President and your day will come. God bless America and those like you that fight to preserve our country. Thanks.
Why do you support destroying your state's tourism sector?
maybe if #45 payed his taxes, it could help fund healthcare..especially since he's a billionaire. when was the last time he paid US taxes?
Last we saw on msnbc he paid quite a bit in taxes.
not in the last 5yrs.

Hey Ted, lets have Donald pay for it.
Ive said that since the president proposed the wall. Let the confiscated drug money build the wall.

Costs a fortune to catch, feed & jail + more for 1 felon, US has so many: Wall will pay for itself FAST.
Have you asked the TX on the border feel.  Lots of good Americans losing some land.
The is Raleys have proved that a wall can be very effective!
Why just El Chapo? I'm sure there's plenty of busted drug money to go around out there. Fix some roads and bridges while you're at it!
The wall does not work.
#NoBanNoWall
You KNOW the wall won't work for NUMEROUS reasons.
Work on healthcare for all. You had years to create a plan, esp since you ran for prez.
Nowhere in the Constitution is healthcare mentioned. #fullrepeal
You are the best reason to leave Texas.
Let's build normal relationships with our neighbors.
Make El Chapo and Sanctuary Cities pay for it.
If you agree to lock yourself inside "the wall", millions of voters would suddenly favor building it immediately
If being President of the United States was all about name calling we would have a WINNER
You still support a guy who publicly humiliated your wife.
Does that have anything to do with constantly sucking AIPAC's schlong and sending Americans to die for Euro-trash Jews from Poland?

Please, please, please . . . no border wall through the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. What a disaster! Please say no.
Love that idea. Why is nobody listening to you?
Keep up the good work Senator.
Let's get into reality! There is not going to be a wall.
Let's make fun of Ted's family and watch him kiss Trumps ass. #CanCruz18
Shame on you, Sir. That type of money can be better purposed to take care of those in need. What would Eisenhower have done? Rollback GOP.
Is "El Chapo" code for deluded "Trump supporter"?

Ted Cruz you are my Senator 
Better idea- call Mexico's bluff on war against drugs. Give us free reign to take out all their drug kingpins, and $ found pays for wall!
You are a sad representation of the worse kind of politician.
Why not privatize it and tax it? Didn't think about that did you? Another opportunity for Trump & Friends to make a couple of bucks.
How about we build a wall around you and Trump.
I don't care who pays for it, I just want a boarder wal. We spend endless sums on bs @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @RandPaul @SenTomCotton
Ted: NO WALL
Yeah because that would solve our most pressing problem. Idiots.
Why does he keep begging Congress for our money if Mexico is paying for it?
Where is it then, Rafael? So much talk, so little action.
Mexico economy is stronger than ours now. No need for a wall. That's on you and your grifter buddy. @SenTedCruz @Loxodonta_s
Huge waste of taxpayer money.
We should have built that wall around Cuba... yrs ago
That wall is stupid....why can't we do something productive and meaningful for the country w that money?
Wall doesn't work.Remember the tunnels big enough to drive thru? Already digging more.Waste of time,money. STOP HIM #borderwall
But we found the tunnels
#ONETX #RESISTANCE
#ScaramucciPolicy
Rafael, nice try.  Here's an idea, why don't you have a town hall and address real healthcare with Texas voters in an open forum...
Lets make Canada help foot the bill...
Oh Canada....
Why is this idea not gaining more traction? Keep it up @SenTedCruz
seriously? if u want the wall all you rich ppl can pay for it.
And if YOUwant "free" healthcare, YOUpay for it!
As long as you're on the other side of it along with your POS traitor POTUS and his whole sleazy family.
Really?? Can't decide if this is serious and really dumb, or an attempt at humor. And dumb. Be serious, protect Santa AnaReserve
This is another nail in the coffin for the @GOP

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  

Great way to use the American flag
You, sir, have reached a new level of fawning stupidity.
What should we do with El Chapo's money. A wall to slow the transfer of drugs is poetic.
Poetic? Doubtful Effective?  Not as long as people can buy ladders or shovels.
Half of the heroin coming into the country is walked across the border.
Design with sensors
What happened to you? I miss the Tes Cruz that spoke at the RNC convention.
Senator, harboring a criminal fugitive has penalties. Remind me of the criminal and civil penalties for those hiring undocumented workers.
Zero
No. Not a good idea especially for PR. The guy is looked on as a hero by some.
Another Ted Cruz pie in the sky proposal that speaks to some but lacks legal authority and has almost zero chance of enactment.
He's probably like that, since even he knows walls are completely ineffective and there are infinite ways to circumvent them.
Kinda like our worthless immigration policies? And sanctuary cities?
How is Ted Cruz not the POTUS right now?
70% of people come to this country on planes and overstay their visa. How is the stupid wall idea addressing THAT?
Thank your sanctuary citys for that one honey.
Another great idea!!
Let's make Putin pay for our next aircraft carrier -- seize his and the oligarchs' ill-begotten US assets.
What a joke. Not a funny one. But a joke nonetheless.
Didn't he escape from prison by tunneling under a wall? 
Where there is a will there's a way right? Money and your own gang help.
GOP must get off fat lazy butt & stand up for @POTUS. REPEAL health care law, REMOVE MUELLER who is destroying nation, is he on HRC payroll
Unfortunately that would require getting the @GOP to do something aside from delude themselves with #NeverTrump fantasies all day.
If somebody believes this  they must be brainless #fakeTedCruz
Don't attempt humor, unless it is to point out what a stupid waste of money a border wall will be.
As a TX voter, How much $ has #Mexico  paid for the wall? How many #US Tax dollars have been requested by #Trump? HONESTLY answer please!!
Poor balsero you really think el chapo will pay for it? You must be out of u mind this morning
I like it Ted! #BuildtheWall
I like the solar one..we can make a big electric fence and power the southern border states all at once.  Win win.
One problem, solor power cost too much, and isn't worth the  $ !!!
Ted,

Do you realize that any money we could get out of El Chapo's organization was confiscated a long time ago?
lets send Ted Cruz back to Cuba!  he's proven himself to be great resource for authoritarian buffoons!
I'm voting NO on that Senator Cruz.
Illegal crossings are down, right? WHY spend on unnecessary wall?
The El Chapo proposal is brilliant. Thank you Senator Cruz. This is the kind of CanDo thinking #MAGA supporters revere.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
HELLO TED
So we are all Mexican citizens now ? Mexico will pay for it ? Remember?
How does one make a private citizen of a foreign country do a thing? Rule of law Ted. You gonna make Saudi Arabia pay for the 9/11 damage?
Let's take the wall and shove it where sun don't shine. Americans facing 33 mill/wo insurance 800 bill cuts in SS. Will not play to pay.
How about we make El Chapo pay but DON'T build a wall that will divide?
Open borders are dangerous. Haven't you heard good fences make good neighbors
Didn't the President of Mexico laugh at @realDonaldTrump last time he asked for them to pay for the wall?
Absolutely!
Uh he is in prison...

And a wall is useless
He has enough money to build it and then some...
There will be no wall, you guys can let that racist dream die @GOP @SenateGOP #CrookedGOP #BetterGOP #wall
Let's fix health care and stop giving it free to half the country while the other half has to figure out how to pay for it all.
Brilliant.
Good idea
What a worthless senator. I can't wait to vote for @BetoORourke #BetoForTexas
Let's make the banks that launder all that dope money pay for it
