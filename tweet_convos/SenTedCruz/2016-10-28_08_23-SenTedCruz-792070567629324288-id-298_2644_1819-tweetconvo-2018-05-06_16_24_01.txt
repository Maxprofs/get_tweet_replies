she did not " plead the fifth " the truth doesn't need embellishment here
She didn't literally but by refusing 2 answer any questions is just as bad & makes her look guilty of something
sure but that doesn't matter to her. It's a delaying tactic. First rule of lawyers. Stay away from Cops and court
Doesn't matter to any of them, they get to play by a different set of rules than us common folks..
If they do its our fault for allowing it. We vote these people into power, hate them yet rarely vote them out.
I blame others. I never vote 4 incumbents. 2 much pwer 4 too long & U end up w/the likes of HRC, Pelosi, McCain et al
Never. So in your voting, local, State and Federal you only vote each candidate one term no matter their performance.
I've never come across any politician that has had a solid performance where I would give him or her a second term.
How can unclassified material be kept from the public in this manner?  Need clearance to see unclassified material?
This woman should be impeached and removed !!!!#WakeUpAmerica
Indict her by Grand Jury! Let her plead the 5th while her ass is in prison.
Between white racist(not all R racist) and unethical blacks decent blacks didn't stand a chance to lead
Agreed..Purposely don't put my melanin tone..weed out racists both black &white
@doccigar @FreeBeacon pleading the fifth really Lynch you should be jailed
@jadler1969 That's not what "pleading the Fifth" means.
Give her the "Rack" make her squeal... !
As usual. you lie, asshole.
@JackBones10 @FreeBeacon 
Impeach immediately.
The documents aren't classified - we're just keeping them locked up and hidden and they're a threat to national security
smells of corruption. If HRC gets in, will get worse. Should not be involved in anything that u feel u have to take 5th.
#LockHerUp
we don't do ransom I thought . Goes to show you democratic party lies alot to us
Lynch, a corrupt criminal. Pleading the 5th is guilty. Anyone innocent never pleads the 5th. Despicable woman.
Don't you only plead the Fifth if you feel you will incriminate yourself?
snake!
how about you just go ahead and slap a "c" on that one.
There is space in GITMO for her too
I wonder if that is why #obama is clearing GITMO?
They don't want to share with riff raff.
Maybe because it's too vile & depraved...#GoHillary
@tweet4upatriots  Send U.S. Marshall's and have them arrested as material witnesses in an ongoing congressional investigation
We will need to build a new prison. A big one.
I took a fifth to the judge and he gave me probation
@Italians4Trump I can't believe the degree of corruption.
if we bring back water boarding and she spills the beans is that "voluntary?" (Sarcasm)
crooked Attorney General Lynch needs to have the fbi investigate her, she should be next. lock her crooked ass up to
@neptune7321 @FreeBeacon @realDonaldTrump this woman should resign immediately she is a big part of the corrupt establishment
@TomRooney @TGowdySC She should be Held in Contempt of Congress.. Sergeant at Arms should "cuff her and place her "under arrest"
the highest levels of American government lying, breaking laws,taking 5th, cash to foreign govs, all liberals.
#udecide
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon  crooks and criminals need to take the trash out
UnFuckingReal
#MAGA3X 
Like I have said .IMO This goes all the way to the "top"    Wikileaks has been getting too close. "Deflection" time.
does she not answer to 'We the People'?
SHE DIDN'T PLEAD THE FIFTH- READ THE ARTICLE PEOPLE
@RenaSummersLtd @FreeBeacon of course she does all of these left criminals plead the 5th
Obstruction of Justice and Acts of High Treason on the Horizon when DJT is POTUS #MAGA #TrumpPence16
she will cover for obama until fired she thinks she will be judge on Supreme Court not going to happen
our Government has reached the level of corruptions that's comparable to the 3rd world countries.Time to #draintheswamp
how is it that a public servant can refuse to answer questions ?
WHAT? WHY? Why would she even need to plead the 5th?
Corrupt to the core.  The whole lot of them. Despicable and disgusting.  We need an outsider to try to clean this up.  TRUMP.
How in the hell would the fifth apply to legitimate state business?
Obama protecting her as well
@veganvecoh @FreeBeacon, smart woman, covering her ass and bosses ass.....
@Apatriot11 Who does Lynch represent?
@RockMetalKittyX @FreeBeacon @FBI sounds like corruption and collusion to mean
protecting herself President and Hillary
Will be so Glad when the Soetorro Scumbags are GONE.
Headline read "pleads fifth". The article reads "refusing to comply."  Either way, you have to wonder why she isn't talking.
@VickyWillkan @FreeBeacon So insane that the AG of USA pleads 5th. I feel like I've stepped back in time and to a developing country
Anyone that does this should immediately be removed from office.
and the meeting with bill clinton
Should be fired or impeached.
@LorettaLynch needs to go! #draintheswamp
That's becasue she only knows how to count to five!
AG of the #USA takes the Fifth?  Shame!  Why are so many gov officials so corrupt?  From #IRS to #VA to #FBI Stop!
@RestoreHistory @FreeBeacon what a joke
they are ALL corrupt !!
@Byrlyne @FreeBeacon wow crook
Yep!
Witch Hunts have become so ridiculous; that all Government Employees in both Parties should take the Fifth.
The Fifth Amendment in the Constitution is as precious as the 2nd Amend. Natural outcome of spending $$ on wild ass chgs
@kin2souls @FreeBeacon so does that mean the Attorney General is under investigation as well? Who watches the Watchers??? #Mayhem
Hopefully people are awakening enough so that We the People can demand rightful JUSTICE!
is this why the @fbi decided today to reopen Hillary case?
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon The freaking AG plead the 5th???????
WE pay HER salary  Answer the questions or turn in your resignation
she needs to go also....drain the swamp..
isn't "pleading the 5th" here just Marco Rubio's analogy for her saying she won't answer a question? Your headline seems rough
@bwv_54 @FreeBeacon MYbe I'd kinda like my AG to answer questions truthfully and completely.Will she be held in contempt? #Lockherup
gov officials should not be allowed to use 5th amendment #DrainTheSwamp #UnRigTheSystem #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon she shouldn't be allowed to plead the fifth
All who subvert the people's rights will be brought to justice. Lynch you will see justice when you are held in contempt.Lock her up
@CmmnSnse1 @623Sis @CounterJihadUS @rsienkiewicz @realDonaldTrump #FreeJulian
Why the 5th if not corrupt?
Guillotine!
Is everyone corrupt over there?
didn't you hear?  All the cool kids are corrupt. @Kredo0
@KahlerSabrina WOW!! NO SHAME FOR OUR JUSTICE DEPT REPRESENTATIVE!!WHERE IS YOUR HONOR?!? @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @GOP
A Congressional Subpoena is worth just a little less than a square of toilet paper.
Isn’t that a lot like saying “Catch me if you can, jerks."
No Teddy, the AG did not take the 5th. She didn't appear at all. Words matter Senator. Go back to your failed legal practice.
@Italians4Trump @FreeBeacon Really?  How does the director of DOJ get to plead the fifth and keep the job?
yep shes another Liar
The US AG take the 5th! She MUST resign. She has NO credibility & can never be trusted ever again! #DeptOfNoJustice
@Italians4Trump @FreeBeacon @realDonaldTrump how can she allowed to do so ?????
@Italians4TrumpAm I the only one that has a fundamental problem with the Government doing things the public CAN'T know about?
@Italians4Trump @FreeBeacon @foxnews..WASHINGTON DEMS/LIBERALS HEADING FOR THE "sewer" WITH ALL THE OTHER  " RATS " ...WOW!
Nothing will come of this, she'll leave with a big pension or go to a big paying job. Majority will still vote Democrat
@_Proud_American @FreeBeacon Well well well
U can get shackles ready to, cause she going down as well.
This is ridiculous..she should be impeached..she knows it was wrong
I just love how "transparent" this administration has been.
@benshapiro @FreeBeacon Is there enough time????  Trump needs to blanket the airwaves.
@AdamBaldwin @FreeBeacon send @LorettaLynch  to federal prison with the rest of @BarackObama administration
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon OMG guilty for checking herself she needs to resign
@AmericanMex067 why is it everyone gets to plead the 5th and nobody goes to jail? Or " I don't recall" BS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Good for her!GOP congress wastes money on witch hunts! It's my understanding that the money was Iran's!
@twright55 @FreeBeacon just answer the questions. We can handle the truth. Stupid AG with no values to the people. Unfit.
Is it legal for her to plead the 5th to congress?

@SenTedCruz wow head of DOJ pleading 5th. Not a good look @philowisdomMD @MungerSwag
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon WAKE UP AMERICA
@JasonMillerinDC @FreeBeacon corruption! 
Generally, when you put something in quotes after a person's name, it should be because they said whats in the quotes.
There should be something contractual that when getting into such positions, you can no longer plead the 5th. What BS.
Wonder if Dir Comey advised AG Lynch about new emails + his letter informing congressional committee chairs.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon #lockheruptoo!!
@benshapiro @FreeBeacon 
@SpeakerRyan @TGowdySC @Reince @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump 
TAP scroll read 
What. Kick her out.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon  Ok, good grief, she did not "plead the 5th". She may be a crook & liar but be honest about ur headline.
Shouldn't this come with a letter of resignation?
NOT accurate. She reminded the Congress that they are barred from publicly disclosing details. Did NOT "plead the fifth."
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Drain the swamp
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon astonishing.
Her silence says it all.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Of course she will. FBI, DOJ AND HOMELAND SECURITY are all corrupted!
@FoxNews -> has @attorneygeneral pleaded fifth on this'd!?
Is it finally all coming apart  for this political crime syndicate. I prey it is and they all turn on each other
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Sir, American Military DIED w/ Honor# STOP Corruption in Whitehouse FBI -VOTE Trump
during Iran contra all those republicans pleaded the 5th. If it wrong now it was wrong then. Stop being hypocrites
Can it be? The whole corrupt structure is collapsing?
@benshapiro @FreeBeacon Declining to cooperate with Congress much worse. Drain the swamp
man ole man....they are all so damn corrupt
@benshapiro @FreeBeacon  of course she does! #trump
REPUBLICAN B S .
...related to FBI news today?
#The shit is about to hit the fan
Somebody needs to keep an eye on AG Lynch's flight plans to make sure she doesn't meet with Bubba again. #CrookedHillary
Banana Republic.
Hold that bitch in contempt of Congress!
she can't take the 5th as a Government employee!!!!!!
is this a joke??????
@AmericanMex067 @FreeBeacon Attorney Generals should lose their 5th Amendment rights upon swear-in.
@JaredWyand @FreeBeacon 
Of course she will...another one of Obozo's losers.
.@Kredo0 @JasonMillerinDC @FreeBeacon 
The Obama Administration = Nothing but PURE CORRUPTION! And now he wants 2 pass the torch to Hillary!

FBI reopens Clinton email Probhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/28/fbi-reopens-investigation-into-clinton-email-use.html … 
@Carolde @slone @Cernovich @LindaSuhler @DanScavino 
#DrainTheSwamp #LockHerUp
@cariker_f @FreeBeacon If she talks, she'll expose the plan!  Many involved. Iran will not use $ properly & break themselves again.
@JasonMillerinDC @FreeBeacon imagine that. The person who should be of impeccable moral judgement
I guess we are getting the line-up of people whom @POTUS will be pardoning, @LorettaLynch & @HillaryClinton to start with.
The whole damn Obama Admin is CORRUPT! Starting from the top down!
@FreeBeacon@newtgingrich

Surely to goodness the attorney general of the USA is not allowed to do this!
@JasonMillerinDC @FreeBeacon What the heck is this? Everyone can just plead the 5th these days??
@warznemeisis @FreeBeacon: How long can d truth be suppressed? There's nothing hidden under d sun. God's judgment day is coming.
@PoliticalShort @FreeBeacon The most corrupt administration
she prob needs to meet with Bill 1st b4 she answers
@ACUConservative @FreeBeacon  is this legit story? u r only source reporting this.
Why Did Republicans Approved Her For Attorney General...Whats Going On!
Our top lawyer cop pleads the 5 th kick her out of that position
Can a law enforcement officer plead the Fifth? Shouldn't that disqualify them from their job? What could possibly incriminate her?
That's is unbelievable! She works for the American people and should be made to answer!
so to confuse people R's are screaming about them following the rules about not publicly disclosing the info.
@BeladonnaRogers @FreeBeacon IT TELLS YOU A LOT WHEN THE WHOLE GOVT. PLEADS THE 5TH B/C THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS.#SOSADUSA
@AmericanMex067   Fire her. Kick her out / vote her out.
sorry, but this headline still doesn't accurately track with the story or, y'know, what actually happened. C'mon, guys.
@JaredWyand @FreeBeacon The most transparent administration has done more to hide the truth than any administration in history of US
Do we still shoot traitors?
If not, we need to start again
