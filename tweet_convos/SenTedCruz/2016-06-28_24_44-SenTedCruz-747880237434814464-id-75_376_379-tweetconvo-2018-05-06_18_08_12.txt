charming
Who cares about "charming" when the Republicans are being major a$$holes YET again?
your language is not necessary
Well, then, use the mute button. I'll use whatever effin' language I want!
very lady like. And professional
BTW, I find it interesting that U choose to attack me rather discuss the issues at hand. Says alot about U.
. How is @FionaMoodie attacking you @SudokuG? Also why are the Republicans and @TedCruz the problem when Obama is wrong
the Obama administration considers the enemy to be conservative christians
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz This hearing is just a waste of time and energy and has no meaningful purpose.   Names don't matter.  Get results!
keep up the good work!
its time teddy
Obama needs to be impeached like today! Throw the bums out!
think the police should have pick them up and brought them there,lawless but above it.
Very important but still a waste of time and taxpayers' money. Focus on Economy, Jobs, Nat'l Sec, Border Sec., Sup. Court
,@melissayou would rather lie about it
And cover it up as usual
@Dollie_VAL @tedcruz watched it all yesterday Cruz very presidential & everybody else clueless McCarthy stance to fight terrorism
What's in a word?
Cruz and repubs won't even use the words right wing nut jobs but better start.
no but we can say satanic liberals
yes that I agree repubs sure can name call.
what about semi automatic weapons Ted, anybody on the no fly list can buy one, what about that Ted
Senator Ted Kennedy was on the no fly list, because the list was a waste of time  Inaccurate. The FBI cut-release Y?
Well, duh. it's another stupid #GOP led nonsense investigation.You could use fluffy pink unicorns & nothing would change
hillary lied to the families, while telling her own family the truth.  They gave everything, she gave nothing
bulldozer?
@Fionamoodie or you cud delete her
Like hillary wud do. Ha,ha ,ha
just chill or Donald  Trump may call you a liar
I'm glad someone is standing up for the important shit, like attaching useless monikers to psychopaths in speeches. #YEAHTED
Wow Ted. How can you let something like that get under your thin skin.
yes that's correct when he was a "businessmen" Go Trump
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz That's because it's just about Ted trying to stay in the news...didn't work..  Sorry little ones.
TrusTed to Lie @tedcruz refuses to help & fight to get Healthcare Vouchers for our Veterans still dying to see a doctor or be admitted.
@GovPenceIN @HillaryClinton There is a 3% federal excise tax on local telephone service that helps to pay for wars. Increase?
you can't investigate that nor make it criminal in any way. Gather evidence of some kind against him if you want a case.
Why should they waste their time with your stupid Inquisition? You are the American Taliban. No better than any other radical.
Real headline? Administration ignores latest irrelevant ploy by irrelevant Canadian senator
we all know who to blame for ignoring the US constitution,Boehner, McConnell,Ryan,Pubis others.Cruz will be ignored until 2012,
duh, 2020
probably because he's way smarter than you
Its a shame the hearings don't have the weight of law. Obviously BHO, Soros, Pedesta, MM and MS media don't fear the people.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz cudos to Pres Obama for seeing it as nothing but political grand standing by a guy that couldn't even beat Trump
. No surprise...don't want to get call on.....there hurting all Americans lives
America has real issues. The president don't have time for your silly games#doyourjob stop obstruction
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz How many millions in tax dollars you planning to waste on your semantics investigation?
ted endorse trump and impeach this man called obma if possible
when will @tedcruz use the term rightwing Christian terrorist?
Lol..."refuses to face" huh? Yeah...I'm *sure* that's it...Lol... https://twitter.com/CR/status/747878427294826497 … @TedCruz
Obama Admin Refuses to Face @TedCruz Led Investigation into non-use of "Islamic Terrorist" by Admin

https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/06/obama-administration-officials-play-hooky-from-cruz-hearing-on-radical-islamic-terrorism …
Might as well claim that "Obama refuses to address FaceBook comment allegations that he is a poopy face and no one likes him."
Fuk cruz and his grandstanding ,he is slime fukwads
Calling something by a name makes it that. I used to call you "Lyin' Ted". You resisted being called it. You just proved me rt.
huge attack on airport in Turkey just happen maybe we need to open r eyes to how bad shit is getting out there
.@tedcruz gosh! It's "Radicle Islamic Terrorism". U have shortened it Teddy. Soon you'll be saying just "Islamic". Ted Dividing America.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Just a rabbit hole 2/keep Congress from dealing with imp issues/Benghazi/emails/SOSlies giving away our SOVEREIGNTY
caus #cruz is a #swiveleyednutjob so good on the pres...
#Benghazi gravy train comes to an end, time to find something else ridiculous to "investigate"
More accurate to replace "Obama Admin Refuses" with "rational adults refuse" @tedcruz @SenTedCruz
It's good that @tedcruz is back on the job wasting taxpayer money on another bs investigation.
Really? What next? An investigation into which side of the toilet paper Obama uses to wipe his ass? #PurePartisanBullshit
americans need real help and solutions on many issues, and these gutless wonders investigates words, do you fucking job
you will get the same Obama snub from a #HillaryClinton but not from @realDonaldTrump. It's time for you to endorse our choice.
Trump was scared to debate TC why would he now?  TC is the most intelligent man out there.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz As well they should. What a waste of Americans hard earned dollars.
Good. Because it's stupid!
So irresponsible people won't use it to inflame international tensions for political gain?
Of course he did. He's been quite clear on the matter. What a waste of time and resources. Way to focus on what's not important
They are just following orders.
#willfulblindness
Obama's a coward
