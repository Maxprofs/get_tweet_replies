You intolerant zealot! You are too part of the problem!
maybe it would be easier to comprehend if he quoted the part of the bible that says decapitate non Christians
We're too rich and sophisticated for that. We can afford to use drones to kill in the name of our so-called God.
but again please quote the verse that calls for killing non Christians in the bible. I'll wait...
Deuteronomy 17
equality, human rights, tolerance, don't exist under sharia
Or on North Carolina public restrooms.
ya, requiring a person to use their biologically defined gender to use their restroom to protect women from pervs.
It was specifically a hate crime against members of the LGBTQ community; murdered in Orlando. A community you fight to oppress.
committed by a registered Democrat.
And we know this how?

Already settled. Irrelevant.
Seems all mass shooters are Democrats though.
False. @smokie_tx @rednorsk
history seems to be a problem with you. We're done.

.@SenTedCruz How exactly would the "full force of the US military" prevent a shooting committed by a US citizen born in New York? #Orlando
.@NCBlake @SenTedCruz Perhaps in a non-political FBI they would actually take action instead of remaining concerned for a suspects feelings.
.@RepubBillCan Fun fact: @SenTedCruz voted to allow FBI terror suspects to purchase weapons!
.@NCBlake @SenTedCruz When will you idiots realize appeasement does not work with savages? You cannot fight against a jihad with nice words.
I agree. That's why I oppose allowing terror suspects & violent criminals to buy guns. @SenTedCruz disagrees.
.@NCBlake @SenTedCruz Alright smart guy. How so? And don't say voting against background checks or closing the gun show loophole.
.@RepubBillCan Senate voted just months ago on a bill to prohibit gun sales to terror suspects. @SenTedCruz voted no
And only known terrorists are on the list right? Couldn't be abused could it? Of course not. Next?
really? Can you honestly say that about the NRA?
@sylviagreier @SenTedCruz
NRA not work 2gether /c any1 2 save lives. NRA not concerned /c anything but 1st ammendment no mater loss of life
You realize that all of the mass shootings have been in "gun free" zones, right. Criminals call that easy pickings
& your point being?
Statistically, gun ownership prevents murder, assault, etc. where gun bans aren't the law
@FRCdc Ted Cruz you stood on a stage with a Christian pastor that wants to kill all the gays. We know you side with him.
Really? All of America? Because it looks like you didn't always support the LGBT community.
Ted sadly, no one believes you care one iota about the dead or their families. Your ugly words helped to foment this hate.
so true https://youtu.be/xg9pJV9vdxs 
today it seems more like you & supporters stand in solidarity w/Hillary & her program for 500% increase in refugees #onlytrump
If you truly stand with Orlando, then #DisarmHate today by voting YES to prohibiting gun sales to suspected terrorists!!
but you voted allow citizens on the terror watch list to purchase military grade weapons. How does that work?  Thanks @harto 
So now gay people are OK?
Yes please stand with Orlando and then the next city because you refuse to pass proper gun legislation. #DisarmHate #Enough
You HATE gay people. You done nothing but hate for months against gay people and now? At least be consistent with your hate!
.@SenTedCruz do you stand in solidarity with the LGBT community?
I'd like to respectfully ask this question again: do you stand in solidarity with the gay community?
you mean the gay people you call an abomination? #hypocrite
Then why did you accept a speech intro from a pastor who believes all gays should be put to death?
You're a hypocrite, after attending a Kevin Swanson event who advocates for the killing of lgbtq people. Shame on you! @SenTedCruz
@ShawnFnLucas @SenTedCruz Father Cruz and their pastor friend & super pac director @DavidBartonWB are as homophobic as Islam!
I think you've already soiled your reputation on this issue. There's no room for your after the fact solidarity. 

#orlando
You left Sandy Hook & Aurora out of your statement. Muslims are not the problem - hatred & easy access to guns ARE.
.@SenTedCruz Does the Zodiac Killer stand with all gay people?
Why Is the Media Ignoring Ted Cruz’s Embrace of ‘Kill the Gays’ Pastor? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelangelo-signorile/post_10496_b_8544540.html …
The hate you spew is what causes things like this. Go away. Please
http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/03/video-reveals-pastor-calls-for-execution-of-gays-then-introduces-ted-cruz-on-stage/ …
just a tiny bit of a hypocrite aren't you sent to run around with religious leaders that denounce lqbt.
YOU voted to allow Americans on the terror watch list to have guns. #Orlando blood is on your hands.
.@SenTedCruz You know what would help more? If you had voted to stop terrorists from being able to purchase guns. NRA=WIN, 50 families, LOSE
Even the gay ones? AKA the victims you've hated and vilified literally your entire career. #PulseNightclub
Ironically, the attacker targeted gays b/c he thinks they symbolize what's wrong with America. Just like you do.
Does America not stand in solidarity with the gay community, which was the actual target of the attack?
I'd like to believe you, but your nose is actually growing.
You don't stand in solidarity with us.  You condemn us.  Fuck your pathetic platitudes.
.@SenTedCruz Do you stand in solidarity with all gay people?
vile, vile man. how do you sleep at night?
what'd he say?
visit his page
what, that he thinks the shooting was perpetrated by an Islamic extremist who pledged allegiance to Isis?
Thanks for your solidarity, but doesn't Kevin Swanson, who you shared a stage with, advocate for the killing of gay people?
ON YOUR HAND
,  https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/742092773239754756 …
you have vilified, demonized and marginalized us for political gain, don't use LGBT victims to justify your hatred of Islam
Don't erase the victims. They were targeted for a reason. Say LGBT. I dare you. #hatecrime #pulsenightclub #Orlando
Yet you voted against background checks 6 months ago.
you stood with a pastor who wanted gays killed.  Pray harder.
you're part of the problem that caused this!
Your comments towards Islam are so utterly steeped in bigotry! Islam is a faith, not the acts of hateful Muslim zealots!
put some of that solidarity behind banning assault weapons!
All of America BUT you, because you keep encouraging "christian" pastors who call for our murder publicly. #HypocriticalSwine
I saw that televised and Cruz walks on stage after a chilling rant
then stop palling around with bigots and being one yourself.  Your demonization of LGBT people legitimizes this hate.
you must help stop auto weapons, they only kill people
coming from the biggest gun loving homophobe of all time. Wonderful
you're a fucking moron.
thoughts and prayers with those and their loved ones.
Sit the fuck down! Oh No you don't!
- So maybe you should tell your Christian cronies not to go around slandering the LGBT community.
But will you let them marry the person they love, use the bathroom of their choice, have job and housing protection?
All of America except Obama.
stand in solidarity, then dive right into attacking our President all while never mentioning congressional inaction. #vile
HYPOCRITE
@SenTedCruz
A domestic terrorist without an assault weapon doesn't kill 50, wound 50+ others.
Your revisionist history is duly noted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing …
Here is some useful context. The 1990's it isn't:
#WeAreAllOrlando
- Omar Mateen exercised his 2nd Amend right to buy & bear the weapon of his choice. Will you say you are glad he was able to?
THIS is America...fundamentally transformed. I'm sick of Obama, Hillary, Romney, Ryan and whole bunch
Kevin Swanson "execute gays who do not repent" 

So how was that rally with Kevin where you were a guest speaker?
You weren't standing in solidarity w/ LGBTQ community before. This is what happens. I bet you think this was all divine
All except liberals, they're more worried about guns, the NRA and how to fit this into a no guns pro islam platform!first!
You really are just one of the worst people to ever crawl the earth.
If this monument's dedicated 2Abraham, why do they worship it? Only believers inG_D R Abrahams seed!
please know that today...the country needs you and Trump to Unite. Bury the hatchet...do the right thing. I know you can do this
say it ! "Gays and lesbians "!  Say it or admit to your cowardice #pretendweareinvisible
such cold comfort you charlatan. You've dedicated your career to knocking down gay rights. We don't want or need your sympathy.
except for the gays and the Muslims, right?
obviously not all a American committed the horrendous act.
RT @SenTedCruz Today, all of America stands in solidarity with the people of Orlando. http://1.usa.gov/1WKzZnr 
It would be refreshing for some Senator/Rep to offer some meaningful actions to reduce this spreading threat. How about you??
not me maybe these 2 dumb beavers do,I think it was overdue,just b sure 2 run into ur sex bathroom nDuck
You hate Gays so today you should be celebrating
Oh reallyTed? And how much have you received from the NRA? And did you vote on banning assault weapons? #hypocrite
America this is how a true statesman responds! #Cruz 4 President.
and he denounced him. Don't YOU remember that?
against radial Islamic terror, militant Islam, ISIS, and all the apologists.
Why Senator Cruz are you not leading the charge to impeach the criminal residing in our White House? He is a terrorist!
Maybe because the House impeaches, not the Senate. Ted Cruz is a senator.
Cruz should still b shouting from the rooftops. Impeach Obama now!
So is Kevin Swanson standing in solidarity? Not by word or deed. Just like I find your sentiments equally hollow.
I think it's time to #EndGunFreeZones and have #NationalReciprocity.
Today, all of America stands in solidarity with the people of Orlando. http://1.usa.gov/1WKzZnr  -- @SenTedCruz
pass gun laws that ban these assault style weapons. 50 more citizens were denied the constitutional right of life and liberty
More like in solidarity with Trump! There's nothing like terrorism to make everyone forget I have no idea what I'm doing! WOOHOO
close borders. Mathew 25:32, Acts 17:26, Numbers 16:21, Leviticus 15:31 and oust #thepoliticalterroristincheif
Ok Ted, here is another act of war on America.  Time to declare war on the Islamic State.
Says the guy who attended a “kill the gays” conference and shook hands with the man who openly called for executions.  #phony
you need to stand with Trump. He was right and this is the problem
