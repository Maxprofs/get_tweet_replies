Dies Laughing Grasping For #Straws..  You Loose #America Wins.. Suck Up Butter Cup Find Your Safe Place

Greg No Disrespect Honestly Stop And Look At What Barry And Hill Are Fixing To Try To Do. Seriously  it is real
his failed businesses and casinos, his blanket lies and instability is an indictment on his ability to lead
corrupt judicial system  racial division.. it is not a ploy it is reality..
Trump has shown that his merchandise is made in China. He makes his living in cheap labor over seas.
Once trade is fair & corp taxes lowered, Trump products will be made in the USA
Shame the comments are all about Cruz rather than the issue at hand.  Thanks for taking a stand.
@Andromodid @SenTedCruz @POTUS @RepSheppard @SenStabenow @SenGaryPeters  We are asking that you STOP #ICANN 1stA  MI Res.
#ICANN has no #1A implications

THANK YOU. Looking forward to the First #VetoOverride next week. Don't Mess up. http://RestoreStmarys.org 
"the [US] had gone back on a 20 year old promise that it would give up oversight of the DNS root"
"...since it will pretty much take the government out of controlling the internet"
Cruz, do you have a bad memory like Trumpy?
Still better than Hillary, m8.
I don't think so. She has at least some values and ethic - unlike those 2 clowns.
"gags, proceeds to throw up"
Pres Barry Soetoro was using a Pseudonym/ FAKE NAME with Hillary. Let me guess. BARK INSANE YOMAMA. WHY?
.   To little to late Real men stand up
Thank you, Dr. We're running out of time!! @NetworksManager @Parker80Ted @SenTedCruz @POTUS

Please explain how @ICANN effects 1st amendment rights. We can't figure it out.
@Andromodid @SenTedCruz @POTUS  WATCH VIDEO AND RETWEET PLZ IMPORTANT 
It feels dirty, absolutely filthy, to stand by the side of Burgess and Cruz here. Ugh. Must shower.
Obama is undermining USA and free speech with internet give away.  You Must Stop Him!
Thank you. #MAGA 
Wow @SenTedCruz @tedcruz are losing followers by the hundreds since he bowed to Trump!
but he is regaining more for honoring his pledge, and supporting our party nominee.
Trump broke the pledge first. It's on record. No one was obligatied after that.
the old loser republicans in congress that no nothing about technology need to get out
Obama said in un speech that we will have to give up some liberties.i give up no liberties2 any1
Obama had nothing to do with the Patriot Act did he ? But Bush is cool.
@Johnsontx5Diane @SenTedCruz @POTUS  MANY GOOD REASONS to see why this was done.  I'm not tossing Cruz under bus. 
he tossed all who stood with him&took the insults under the bus. unbelievable
Cruz IS brilliant!  Who in Congress has a resume like his? 
the people who defended and supported him got stabbed in the heart
Anger has clouded your judgement which should be aimed at #FireReince #CanCornyn &  others. #AlwaysCruz http
RNC is, & has been, THE problem. Has he EVER won one FOR US?  2008, 2012!  And now, we are Upset w/ Cruz?
not woes of USA that upsets me w/Cruz.it's the stab in the heart that's going to take a minute to heal.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @POTUS Stupid the people would have respect you if you never bow to Donald,he stole the election formU

the internet is a global resource that is not exclusive property of any country, just like phone lines
@RepStevenSmith @SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted Cruz the spawn of Satan fights against freedom
Cruz fights against freedom
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @POTUS Isis usin intrnet for recruits. But U ok with 1st amendment limits? #Whatswrongwiththispicture?

Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/michaelcburgess/status/779432233241378816 … (Ranked 1st for Sep 23.)
Another one selling out his soul for a few moments of glory. #TraitorsUSA.
I hope Eric Mauck replaces you!!
Is he making you give Eric and Donny Jr horsey rides around his tacky penthouse? #Sellout #NeverTrump
and by siding with a person who wants to shut down parts of the internet. Hooray?!
thx senator Cruz for doing the right thing.. I know it wasn't easy but it was the right thing
@WineGuyVenice @SenTedCruz @POTUS Welcome Aboard Sen Cruz
thank you, I was really hoping you would support Senator Cruz
it's only a few days before Cruz posts that meme of his wife
Gee a doctor @michaelcburgess who like TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz doesn't give a shit about Veterans still dying waiting to see a doc.
I don't think a single person in Congress understand how the internet works.
Firstly, the US government doesn't even have control over the internet or internet freedoms in the first place.
Instead, it is "owned" by whoever owns the web pages and the servers. A large number of private entities like Google, Cisco, etc
Those private entities have control of their own servers and content in accordance with the laws of their home country.
The internet deal happening does not affect how those companies operate or influence anyone using the internet.
That's all that's happening. the Privatization of the oversight of DNS. No one using the internet will notice any changes.
In fact, when ICANN was created in 1998 one of the first things said was that the US control of DNS was TEMPORARY
There is no authoritarian regime that will take over ICANN. Stakeholders will. Many of which are probably US based.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @POTUS Michael, that dope Ed Wallace may never have you on his dumb show again @570KLIF

@tedcruz @SenTedCruz How nice, Senator. Good for you. You'll still never be president; that's all over now.
Bad timing on your tweet. Idiots are focused on Trump endorsement instead of UN controlling Internet.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @POTUS

@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz you're a fool & you agree with everything ignorant trump said about your family
Bravo Congressman Burgess! Let's get behind this important ICANN issue before it's too late!
