@pinksugar61 @Kredo0 ~ who the f#@! Do these ppl think they are?? Sickening. #NeverHillary
@USMClavadog @Kredo0 The corruption of Democrats is a never ending story. They TALK tolerance, virtue, humanity, but LIVE none.

@tedcruz @Kredo0 I say lets waterboard her
How Wrong can Wrong Get? Hillary and her Corrupt Scam on the American Public Must be Rejected. Lord Help Us! 
What incriminating evidence does Comey have on Lynch?  Enough to protect him, I'll wager.
her boss is even more guilty
yup.
@tmonroe28 @Kredo0 so corrupt! Pray a president Trump puts law and order in place!!
@USMClavadog i am impressed she can count that high

They both should have orange suits.
It's time to clean house. Get these amateurs the hell out. Let Trump get his cabinet in place to drain the swamp.
Ethics Matters!!
Abuse of power!
When you sign up to work for Obama or Hillary, you are agreeing to participate in corruption.
@P0TUSTrump Well,well,well, what do you have to hide?  All pleading the 5th!
Wish I could say to all of them "off with your heads."
Headline is misleading. Why not just say Lynch refuses to answer questions?
@P0TUSTrump @Kredo0 Fire her if she cant report to us! Her job is to help America not herself!
@P0TUSTrump @Kredo0 you know they're a bunch of crooked politicians & all in cahoots when everyone pleads the 5th #DrainTheSwamp

@FoxNews 
This is without a doubt an incrimination of our government! The Gov't is a major crime center!
Disturbing on many levels. Zero transparency from our top legal official? Unacceptable. #Elections2016 #hillaryEmails
2/2 @FreeBeacon @SenTedCruz @Kredo0 surely you know the difference between refusing to answer questions ur not compelled to answer & the 5th
1/2 @FreeBeacon @SenTedCruz @Kredo0 come on! You're supposed to be a Christian & a Harvard trained lawyer
Hillary's scandal proof we R still being impacted by Bill Clinton's decision 2 fire all Attorney Generals in 1993 replacing with partisans
@tedcruz @Kredo0 #CORRUPTION everywhere in the Obama regime! #UN-AMERICAN!
@tedcruz Crooked Loretta Lynch should resign ASAP! Disgrace to FBI and Americans!
corrupt tentacles of the Clinton machine.
@MeosoFunny @Kredo0 Our Nation's top law enforcement officer pleads the 5th! The Clinton "virus" claims another victim!
the most transparent administration thing was just for the 1st term
what?
after 8yrs of Obama the entire team has taken the FIFTH. ...don't they drink pints. ..lmao. Motley crew of libs lying
@tedcruz @Kredo0 Corruption!  Vote for term limits
USA needs Trump for the world USA we are all laughing at you get your act together vote Trump for freedom we got Brexit
@tedcruz @Kredo0
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 Guilty As Sin
@kgaylandb @Kredo0 So that means she is guilty and she knows it.
call drawing a line in the sand,  not for this current admin- think they are untouchable? It's gonna be a game if domino's!
@SharonMcCutchan @Kredo0 @joexg30 
Also guilty of colluding with the corrupt. Highly inappropriate for a person of this stature
@tedcruz @Kredo0 Every single person in this administration is a corrupt fraud.
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 Ya... she's s stellar representative of the justice system. #DrainTheSwamp #NeverHillary
@umass94 @Kredo0 way to go DOJ!!
Does Lynch work 4 the people of America or the Clinton's.This behavior is a blatant disregard for the rights of all!
@STRONG_OPED @Kredo0 #DrainTheSwamp
@STRONG_OPED @Kredo0 @MayorRGiuliani @JudgeJeanine @Judgenap @newtgingrich
@tedcruz @Kredo0   Fifth... would it be expected to be different??  What more do all doubtful minds need to be convinced NO HRC?
Lynch is a disgrace to the http://A.G.office . Meeting Clinton on the tarmac should have been enough 2 dismiss her!
@timetoact2 @Kredo0 Sad state of affairs when an AG has to plead the 5th...
Automatic admission of guilt from someone already incriminated in deep and abiding shit.
Thinking the same thing...
@Bartendernyp @Kredo0 Transparent 
should not be allowed but when prez trump inaugurated arrest her and her band of merry Iranians
needs to be stripped of her duties and off the bench attorney  General pleading the fifth does not deserve a paycheck
@tedcruz @Kredo0 does it bother anyone else that we pay their salary. These people aren't doing their jobs?  #unacceptable
@Dankids3 corrupt beyond contemplation
@Vote4TrumpPrez @Kredo0 
That @LorettaLynch would take the 5th, is worse than @EricHolder being found in contempt of Congress.
@FoxFriend47 Corruption everywhere! #NeverHillary
@tedcruz @Kredo0 what do you mean she pleads the fifth???
@tedcruz @Kredo0 - Lying Ted strikes again
@tedcruz Disgraceful...if this is the answer we get from them, stop their payroll check.
Seems to be an awful lot of that going on!!  Transparent administration??  Hell no!!
@tedcruz @Kredo0 If true hard 2 believe 
@ChadRowland3 @Kredo0 This corrupt DOJ using 5th!Wow she needs to be out of there
@tedcruz @Kredo0   We should really get rid of the 5th amendment
@tedcruz @Kredo0 How can the AG plead the 5th
@tedcruz @Kredo0 corruption at the highest level! And ppl wonder how Trump got this far lol.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 , where is GOP , Paul Ryan, HILIARY new house boy needs to step down. Give job to Cruz he is a fighter
Tired of these crooks. She needs to go

@tedcruz @Kredo0 how about you do something about that
@tedcruz @Kredo.               A crooked Justice official - how original
@tedcruz @Kredo0 Pathetic!! I guess she wants one of those immunity handouts being passed out like Halloween candy!
@tedcruz lock her up to
@tedcruz @Kredo0 of course
@tedcruz @Kredo0 libtards hate the Bill of Rights with the exception of the 5th Amendment, which they plead with regularity.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 these people need to be held to the standards and laws they hold everyone else to. Nail these frauds!
There is no Democrat left that won't plead the 5th.  The whole bunch of them are corrupt.  NO vote for Dem EVER
People who tarnished their reputation by lying for Hillary, Susan Rice, Cheryl Mills, Loretta Lynch,
guess we are having another Iran contra moment.  Put them in jail.  Gitmo seems about right.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 so tired of people elected to represent US think they're above the law and veto over people choice as obama has
@tedcruz @Kredo0 Why isn't it considered a resignation for any official to plead the 5th to Congress or a court?
@tedcruz @Kredo0 ...from the most transparent administration EVER!  LOL
@tedcruz @Kredo0 
Jail Bait...
@tedcruz @Kredo0 she is a JERK!
@ThomPague @Kredo0 A Mafia move by the US Attorney General .. I've never seen such a thing.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 again. Must be a lot to hide.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 This gang takes the Fifth more often then the Chicago Outfit...
@tedcruz @Kredo0  lock her up
what the-of course
@tedcruz @Kredo0 Trump needs to drain the swamp!!!
lock her up
this as already been litigated your trying to add fuel to a fire that's not real
@tedcruz @Kredo0 How can We the People allow this to continue from those hired to serve us. Need a law for government employees.
If a government employee takes the 5th when testifying to Congress they should be automatically fired.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 John Wilkes Booth was seen in new york.
an "Attorney General" pleading the 5th. That's beautiful.
@tedcruz @Kredo0 something sordid about our chief law enforcement officer taking the fifth
This could be quite wearing on uncivil servants
Where is the take the fifth app?
How the hell can our law enforcement take the 5th?  This whole administration is freaking corrupt
This _itch pleads the fifth to everything She needs to be in a cell next to #HillaryForPrison2016
@tedcruz @Kredo0  that is because the bastards have been paying Iran from Jump!;!:*#%*-;:.!!!
@tedcruz @Kredo0 pleads the 5th? Doesn't she work for the American people?  Ask for her resignation!
@tedcruz @Kredo  Didn't take long Loretta! You better come clean!
@tedcruz @Kredo0 she have the right to plead the fifth that impeding justice
@tedcruz @Kredo0 omg what crooks!
@tedcruz @Kredo0 rotten to the core
@tedcruz @Kredo0  she is Evil too
@tedcruz @Kredo0 She must resign
@tedcruz @Kredo0 if anyone thinks that she's not part of the corruption you would be a fool Big Time or Big League
it's Sargeant Schultz
HOPEFULLY JAIL FOR YOU
@tedcruz @Kredo0 HA! I bet he did. Can't imagine why 
@SpeakerRyan Can we have her investigated also?  Who knows how deep the evil goes?
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 
She is an embarrassment to our country!
@SenTedCruz  -WTF THE AG PLEAS THE 5th?
-> @FoxNews did @attorneygeneral plead fifth on Iran hostage payments?  @POTUS @Whitehouse my tax dollars!!!
Wait, the highest ranking Law Enforcement person in our Government can use the 5th amendment to hide behind?
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 throw her out of office
For her position, I don't  think she should be able to constantly  do that! To me, that proves GUILTY!
@seanhannity
She must be gone, too!
Nothing says, "I'm guilty of something," better'n taking the Fifth.
crook!!!
@SenTedCruz Corrupt Loretta Lynch - bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and Clinton Machine!!!
What a joke of an Attorney General. Corruption runs so deep, Lynch with no cred at all. Resign now!
So, actually she didn't plead the Fifth, Clickwhore.
Everybody on Obama's cabinet must know something because they're covering too much up
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 that's pretty much the same as pleading guilty.
From Holder to Lynch.  does not instill a lot of confidence in our justice system.
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 The head of our infamous DOJ engaged in a cover-up over ransom payments?  Will this corruption never end?
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 Really? "Pleading the Fifth"?Another "October Surprise" for HRC? When it rains, it pours it, seems.
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 The whole Obama administration is going down along with Hillary too! Justice will be served
Of course she did. She is a leftist sock puppet.
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 the most corrupt attorney general in the history of our country! #draintheswamp #hillarycamp #cons
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 It was apparent first day..she's Obama's little tool...frightens and sickens me.
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 haha incredible the attorney general please the fifth if that is not corruption I don't know what is
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 She's a dishonest POS too.
"Nothing going on here. In other news, Trump is mean" 

- CNN
Probably will plead 'Filth' as well. @FreeBeacon @SenTedCruz @Kredo0
REPUBLICAN B S .
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 IMPEACH
@SenTedCruz @Kredo0 of course she did
oh my that's not good .. these guys make al Capone look like a choir boy..
Why has she not been fired ... and impeached ... and jailed?
@DocWashburn @Kredo0 I wonder if this investigation is what opened the new FBI investigation into @HillaryClinton
Coming up soon...#DrainTheSwamp #LockLorettaUp
And why do the Republicans do nothing? There must be a better way!
If #CorrputHillary has her way, the Fifth Amendment will be the only one left in the Bill of Rights.
PLEASE KEEP US UPDATED,THIS MATTERS TO THE AMERICAN PPL WHO STAND FOR TRUTH.,HONESTY JUSTICE LIBERTY
