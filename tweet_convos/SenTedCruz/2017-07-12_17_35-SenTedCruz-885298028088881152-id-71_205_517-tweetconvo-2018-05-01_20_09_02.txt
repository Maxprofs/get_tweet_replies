Senate republicans should pass a rule any bill passed by reconciliation can be recended by reconciliation


people's jewelry and stereo equipment are often easy to steal when someone breaks into your house. better not have a house.
It's been exacerbated by the ACA. Let's hope for repeal.
He is the system! He is a monkey throwing shit at the mirror!
Nota,  dude, that's u in the mirror.
Va takes forever to get a simple claim that lost hearing on deck navel ship it is crazy how long it takes

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Says a (man) who will never take the same health care program he wants to foist upon the American public. @tedcruz is a coward

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

Big idea 1: the Cruz amendment.

Creating 2 pools. No one believes this works including prominent Republicans analysts. 6 
@SenTedCruz

House Democrats want to know why a major Russian money-laundering case was abruptly settled

Trump knows for sure.
Get Romney to fix it.
More people will die with your healthcare plan.
BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
.@tedcruz you disingenuous liar. Gov agencies follow the laws YOU in the Senate give them. As former gov employees, vets should know this.
Dang, thats spot on. Is it really you Teddy, and if so keep up the language.
I hope that you don't mind that I download this picture so that I can share it on facebook, please. GOD BLESS SENATOR CRUZ!!!
@tedcruz That's you, Ted. An unresponsive, cumbersome government bureaucrat. #NoTrumpCare

Repeal Obamacare completely. Start from scratch. My premiums and copay are $16,000 K/year plus 40% after on the bronze plan. Outrageous
As a vet, I fought for a country that HAS a bureaucracy. Your ideals give the rich EVERYTHING and your constituents are brainwashed cattle
Mr. Cruz Thank You for the great support to all of us Venezulan!!!!

New version of #Trumpcare exempts Congress. 

So worse care for everyone except the people who vote for the bill! https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/13/15966034/senate-republicans-exemption …

 Here are the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out: 
Align with @RandPaul and Get @SenateGOP on board with Repeal to Free Market HC! Everything @GOP is doing is what Dems do, Entitlements BOOOO
It's the same with congressmen in the senate.
blah blah blah...Texas and concerned vets deserve better representation than they get from Cruz
#Beto 2018
Isn't he part of the Government Bureaucracy.
I agree. Hope the changes Trump put in work. Also, Ted and Trump would be amazing if they work together.
You suck! Kicking 25 million off healthcare will render you a hateful SOB
He is talking about himself in that quote.
It shouldn't be funny, or surprising that we, the disenfranchised people of Texas, feel the SAME way when it comes to you and @JohnCornyn
Concerned Vet: "Ted, I'm sorry, but we may have to put your beloved pomeranian down".
And everywhere in the Federal gov't
great point about government being useless...current US Senator
Said a Government Bureaucrat.
Unfortunately the rest of America isn't the VA, we could make both better.
@SenTedCruz buenos día sr gracias por su apoyo para nuestro pueblo Venezuela sabe usted Hernan escarra conspira
con este gobierno faragido para someter no a la miseria no he justo que viva en su país tenga negocio el
y su familiares no he justo vea sus vídeo con este gobierno de delincuente   y  luego se marche asu país como nad
"And I will continue to be out of touch and take away your care" Ted Cruz, Canadian
It has really been exacerbated in Congress and the WH...Cruz out in #2018, Beto!
Just look how quickly the GOP can spot a liar
So is your Cowardice with regard to POTUS and son's collusion with Russia. Step up and do your damn job.
Republican senators-What good are they and who and how much do they owe? Who are they working for? Because it's definitely not the voters!
Coward husbands like Cruz are non protective, insensitive, & incapable of defending their own families against bullies like Trump. Loser.
Instead of wasting money on refugees, we must spend it on our wounded heros and u.s born homeless.
Any government that would find themselves exempt from a bill should not be allowed to pass any bills! It is time to cut and limit government
@SenTedCruz you perfectly described your own soulless self. #SaveMedicaid #NoBCRA #SinglePayer #RepairACA #NoACARepeal #WorkTogether #NoCruz
By supporting the trumps, you are aiding and abetting a foreign hostile government with the intent of destroying our democracy
and you found these facts from where?
@SenTedCruz Ted please provide military service time, thanks. @indivisibletxjc @MSNBC @indtx36 @nytimes @indivisibleATX
#LOL this from the #Obstructionist Senator who #ShutDownGovernment Laughable #LyingTed! #Loser
