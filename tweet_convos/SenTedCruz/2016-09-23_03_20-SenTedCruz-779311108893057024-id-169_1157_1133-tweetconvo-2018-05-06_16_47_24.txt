@CookingConquest @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal  The 1 Thing He Is Not Is Stupid, O Is Selling Americans Out Again

@DailySignal Then you don't know what ICANN actually does obviously.
The establishment Republicans are going to nothing as they typically do led by McConnell.
@tia6sc @EintheD1 @JimDeMint @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy Going to nothing? Pressing g 1 for ACTUAL ENGLISH
Wow! Do you feel smart now? I know for Trumpkins it doesn't take much.
Well, I CAN spell, so it didn't take much to be smarter than you,  Al. So yeah,  #FeelsGood
Congrats
@lorinda1434 @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal He doesn't care abt  Constituti.He cares abt Globaliz & climate Contro
Internet exposes the corruption of govt.  Must stop the transfer to #ICANN.
I support Obama; can't expend the Internet to stay Word Wide if USA has all control
@TAGOS22 @SenTedCruz Too bad Cruz lost opportunity to discuss when flying on Air Force One. What DID you talk about??
@janefc3 @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal
@ole_47 @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal   Putting free speech at RISK is EXACTLY OBAMA/HRC plan!!
Giving the Internet to dictators is akin to giving hostage takers duct tape.
@tedcruz potus is all for America being owned by the UN. Where is buck turgid when we need him?
i AGREE  STOP #icann TRANSFER TO UN. #ICANN KEEP ICANN IN USA!

Milquetoast Responses

Man Up
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Why has the republic not stopped this man from getting over them time & again. Can you explain this for us.
Obama is a global 'puppet' for the NWO! They've been pushing for a 'one-world government'!! #Communism
@DailySignal Someone needs to be all over TV telling Americans before tome runs out!!!
Convert our internet to INTRANET to protect our Amend Rights. Let others create their own URLs.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal 
& you believe under #PutinTrump it will be better?
STOP IT! You were elected to keep Obama in check--not give him a blank check to do as he wishes!
DeMint like Cruz are both disgraces and embarrassments to America.

@DailySignal THEN DO SOMETHING AND STOP HIM!! Or YOU WILL BE JUST AS GUILTY
.@JimDeMint @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy Either you don't understand ICANN or you are deliberately pushing fear for political purposes
Obama do something against the country that MADE him? i'm shocked. #manchuriancandidat
I am totally opposed to Obama turning control of internet over to UN on Oct 1. Security
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS The @GOP cares as much about free speech as they do about African Americans.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal KKK with you all the way my brother!
You would!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS Never let this internal enemy get away with this!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal obamas plan is simply to destroy the USA as we know it @GOP @FoxNews
@EntheosShines @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal    This was his plan. He is a traitor
Another one who doesn't know how the internet works. Google it
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal
"ICANN HAS NO POWER OVER INDIVIDUAL SPEECH ONLINE." Why are Republicans so stupid? Wow.
@DailySignal @realDonaldTrump @USFreedomArmy
Cannot regulate free speech-violates 1st amendment under U.S. Constitution -DUH
@RepSeanDuff His way of ensuring that the future doesn't belong to those with websites that slander his bud?
Sorry, Jim  but you are way off track on this one.
@JStoddardYoung1 @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal 
Gee, that's great JD, have a nice day!
@DailySignal How do we stop him?
No. He's Trying to GIVE AWAY FREE SPEECH.
Does anyone know WHY Obama is giving away the Internet?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal he needs to stop being an idealist and wake the hell up!  Look around.
It already IS at risk, as the major sites are owned by a few billionaires.
@DailySignal  if Jim DeMint says he agrees. Run in the other direction.
@CzechsforTrump @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS Obama should go f*** himself the Niger Muslim mother f***** I don't care
<  is an asshole that hates America! Needs to be in jail 4 treason. Hillary too!
@CzechsforTrump @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal why is it up to Obama?
The sooner he goes the better. We'll keep finding out things he did for years
@PattyWheeler12 @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal you people in congress need to stop this
@IP4PI @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal POTUS allowing Foreign Corp 2 our public communications-InUrFace #PAY2PLAY
I would venture 2say this would fall under the heading of national security
when you stop free speech, it's the first step to a http://dictatorship.next   the guns
@starknightz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS Obama needs to be tried for treason
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy  @DailySignal So you're going with the man who maligned your wife your father and your faith
must not be allowed to give away the Internet. It is ours. @CalFreedomMom @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal
if you think the internet belongs to anyone you don't understand it enough to speak on it
@DailySignal Obama worships dictators (Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, etc.). He hates free speech.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS  blah blah and blah
@DailySignal obama isn't done with us yet. You watch.
Now he off the golf course.
To hurt us
@DailySignal let's keep our freedom of speech and our sovereignty.
Conservatives have been pleading with Congress to impeach obama.. I knew he's trash the US.
Well he hates America.. he's a psychopath.. he needs to be physically removed from the W.H. ASAP
Talk some since into the Democrats in the Senate.. they'll regret backing O.. & lose seats
That is what they expect you to do ! Keep your tool to be able to reach out and turn this around ..
@tedcruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal Obama is turning our country into a 3rd world piss hole!
I agree w/ @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy: @POTUS is putting free speech at risk giving up US oversight of the Internet http://dailysignal.com/2016/09/21/obama-should-not-put-free-speech-at-risk-on-internet-by-giving-up-us-oversight/ …
Mr. DeMint Chaffin here in Alaska ! Your right and they expect many to give up there internet , no keep your internet guys !
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz I think obama is a jerk!
At risk??  Your man Trump wants to totally take away freedom of speech and expression!
Maybe you need to understand exactly what you are talking first.
@DailySignal SERIOUSLY TRUMP BANS  MEDIA AND YOU SUPPORT HIM? HE INSULTS YOUR WIFE AND FATHER?
...you must be happy for Kaepernick for using his freedom of speech
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal He doesn't want free speech because of all his deserved criticism!
Obama's agenda has been crystal clear, undo America. We shouldn't have so much! Stop HIM!
@tedcruz what right does Obama have to do this?
HAD JIM DeMENTED OPENED HIS MOUTH AGAIN
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy no one cares what you GOP do anymore. Nothing x 8 yrs and nov 8 will reflect it
Except that's not how it works...
.@JimDeMint @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal STOP HIM STOP HIM STOP CORRUPT HATER OF AMERICANS #AMERICA #INTERNET FREEDOM
@tedcruz thought GOP wanted less gov't regulation. This has nothing to do w/free speech. Another GIANT red herring. #thanksGOP
@DailySignal No question about it Jim. Obvious since the FCC failed in its attempt to control it
The key for the American people to react and respond quickly to our government.
CALL CONGRESS, TELL THEM TO STOP OBAMA'S GIVEAWAY OF OUR FREEDOM ON THE INTERNET! AND SUPPORT #PIFA!
foolish move
@DailySignal totally agree.  We have ceded far too much in USA
It's a done deal unless the Senate acts now. Your new internet overlords await.
they're not giving oversight to the U.S., they're giving it to the UN..is this Froidian
@DailySignal 

What are you goingto do about it?

#MAGA #tcot #AmericaFirst #gop #trumptrain
Jim, you are right. We do NOT want gov ctrl of the internet, they mess up everything.
RT @JimDeMint: I agree w/ @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy: @POTUS is putting free speech at risk giving up US oversight of the Internet https://t…
@tedcruz :Our most FUNDAMETAL right is UNDER ATTACK! We must man the barricades if our Congress allows this. It's that important!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal why should this traitor to freedom be allowed to do this??
@DailySignal I agree. I have not called my Senators b/c TN Sen. don't listen
What about you @JohnCornyn ? Step up.
Our forefathers fought and died for our fist amendment. " Not To be Infringed"
@DailySignal PLEASE Congress, step up and STOP this theft of our freedom of speech! Do your job!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal if we dont keep HELLery out of the whitehouse we will have lost it anyhow.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal he's taking apart the country piece by piece! A promise he made to his dad
Why didn't the MAJORITY GOP in the Senate block this? @SenateMajLdr #Sellouts #RINOs
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal why not back @realDonaldTrump and figure out how to reverse giveaway.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal Why is giving this up a good thing?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal Surprise you? The man is an anti American traitor!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS support Donald Trump or shut the F up!
Moron. ICANN has absolutely nothing to do with Internet content.
why is obama still the president? Has washington not seen enough? Time to act . NOW
ICANN has nothing to do with Internet content. Your paranoia doesn't sync w/ reality.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS agree but shouldn't Mitch McConnell being helping this as well??, he was poor choice
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal ...American overlords guarantees freedom of speech?
@DailySignal Obama put our Nation at risk when he bows to Iran! Now our free speech !
@DailySignal Will anyone be surprised to see Obama head the UN when he leaves the Oval Office?
Congress has to stand up to him and just not allowed it to happen. Yes free speech is at risk
The alarm hasn't rung loud enough. It's y'all's duty to get on the evening news and speak up! trickybiz
#DeadbeatDonald sucks all the air out of room. All #DeadbeatDonald all the time. GOP to blame.
.@JimDeMint @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy That's @POTUS's plan.
@DailySignal 

This thread of comments is amazing for its sheer stupidity.
How did Obama ever get control of the internet? It is NOT his to give away!
Man you guys are brilliant!
@DailySignal How are you planning to stop it?
@DailySignal this is all part of Obama's plan before he leaves is out to destroy this country
@Heritage @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal 
DeMint where have you been.  HF must get out of sand for this election
He's been raking in big bucks @Heritage. For indiv. mandate.
@Heritage @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal This is surprising how?  Obama and Soros thinks everyone should heel.
@DailySignal is POTUS doing it to improve the internet or to make himself feel better? Sick man.
@DailySignal 
PLEASE stop this Sen Cruz!!!  Don't let Obumma do this
Although that's exactly what he wants.
Just more of the "leading from behind" which gave the world ISIS...
@Heritage @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal If this is an irreversible decision, then it deserves more debate.
@DailySignal Yes, but what are you doing to stop it? No one wants just your words any more.
@DailySignal obama hates America & our rights. Don't let that POS destroy them.
@Heritage @SenTedCruz @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @DailySignal Get your story straight-HF used to be against gov "running" the internet.
@DailySignal Exactly his plan. And GOP just whines--never stands up and stops anything.
@DailySignal Mr DeMint,  I think we need you back in Washington. Things going haywire there
Someone, anyone invite this idiot out for a round of golf, every day till Jan 20.
