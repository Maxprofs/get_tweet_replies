@resurgent @tedcruz Ted Cruz does not honor MLK. Cruz honors & perpetuates hate. King unified us. Cruz divides for personal gain. #MLKDay
@CletisStump @resurgent @tedcruz Senator Cruz you are a true American !!
@RonnieMay45 @resurgent @tedcruz Enjoy BLOCK CITY
@CletisStump @RonnieMay45 @resurgent @tedcruz moron
@MHafemeister @RonnieMay45 @resurgent @tedcruz Cruz, a moron? I agree completely.
@CletisStump @RonnieMay45 @resurgent @tedcruz stump is dumb as a rock
@resurgent @tedcruz Ted, you are fighting against contemporary civil rights, stfu.
@deadbeatdaphne @resurgent @tedcruz gay marriage serves zero purpose for the betterment of a nation, purposeful procreation does
@SargeantT26 @resurgent @tedcruz what does that have to do with marriage? gay people being denied basic rights does not promote procreation.
@deadbeatdaphne @resurgent @tedcruz what basic rights are they denied
@SargeantT26 @resurgent @tedcruz Being able to get married, you dumbass. Also, anti-gay discrimination in the workplace
@deadbeatdaphne @resurgent @tedcruz get married why does the gov need to support it. Not sure why I needed gov to sanction my marriage eithe
@SargeantT26 @resurgent @tedcruz WHY DO YOU CARE
@deadbeatdaphne @resurgent @tedcruz I care that the gov has to sanction any marriage it's a stupid money grab
@resurgent @SenTedCruz I'm sure MLK would love Trump for his Honesty and sincere Dedication.
@resurgent Since you follow @jacobinmag,@tedcruz, you ought to realize you are honoring a radical.
@consptheory77 @resurgent @jacobinmag @tedcruz what is Ted Cruz radical about? Ted is radical about following to the rule of law US Constusn
@leecfisher1944 @resurgent  No, I meant that MLK was a radical, and @tedcruz should know that if he's following @jacobinmag
@consptheory77 @resurgent @tedcruz @jacobinmag MLK was a radical so is Cruz. Radical=change
@leecfisher1944 @resurgent @tedcruz @jacobinmag A radical is the person who wants to blow up the train station because he never liked it
@tedcruz is actually a moderate conservative by my paleo standards, and that's a good thing @leecfisher1944 @resurgent @jacobinmag
@resurgent oh hell
@resurgent Cruz is a true patriot. He wants to protect our Constitutional rights. Liberals can't understand why that's so important.
@resurgent @tedcruz why didn't you post this, it was only worth a RT from your camp?
@resurgent @rickwtyler A Godly & holy man.  None of us are perfect.  His heart & mind were in the right place. Courageous. RIP Rev King <3
@resurgent @tedcruz GOD bless Dr King. For those of us white folks that grew up in the 60's, we saw Dr King change America without violence
@resurgent @tedcruz Ted Cruz would have released the dogs on the bridge and joined the klan.
@resurgent That's A Hot ITEM A  Must Post To  http://rbl.ms/1Jdq6cS 
@resurgent @tedcruz Ted Cruz stands in the opposite corner as Dr King. It makes me sick how he panders.
@resurgent @tedcruz http://thelastcivilright.org/2012/08/19/the-democrat-party-vs-the-republican-party-who-is-the-true-champion-of-the-ending-slavery-the-civil-rights-movement-and-the-black-community/ â€¦
.@resurgent @tedcruz Cruz represents the opposite of what MLK stood for. This is beyond shameful pandering.
@resurgent @penadaniel87 Cruz discusses MLK and this wknd's Walk for Life against RoeVWade, MLK's niece, Alveda King. Trump unaware of both
@resurgent @SenTedCruz I think King would be appalled by what Alibama, BLM, etc.. has done for (or should I say TO) the black community.
@resurgent @tedcruz CRINGE.PULEASE don't even SUGGEST anything remotely akin to Dr King coming from U!
@resurgent @tedcruz
@resurgent @tedcruz
@resurgent @tedcruz and Ted would have fought against MLK Jr just as he opposes the civil rights issues of today.
@resurgent you are so wrong. Sounds like you are perpetuating hate.  By the way, no one has ever divided our country like Obama.
@rustymason7777 @resurgent @SenTedCruz MLK was not a communist get your facts right
@resurgent I agree with William.  MLK would be saddened by black lives matter.  This is not what he had in mind.
@resurgent @tedcruz yes you honor totally honor his respect and efforts for equality. Then why do you fight to undo the progress he died for
@resurgent @SenTedCruz MLK WOULD BE ASHAMED OF OBAMA
@resurgent @SenTedCruz I remember this speech, I was 11 years old.
@resurgent @SenTedCruz #MLK was a sojourner of justice, and a supporter of democratic #socialism!
@resurgent @SenTedCruz I fully accept MLK vision. I utterly reject BHO'S vision.
@resurgent @SenTedCruz Made up holidays for a made up hero. His message has been so diluted its true spirit is lost.
@resurgent @tedcruz Great man, IMHO.
@resurgent @tedcruz his memory dishonored by Obama, Sharpton and BLM
@resurgent @tedcruz Sure you do, Canadian Ted. Your hate speech and lies so far removed from his teachings
@resurgent @tedcruz
@resurgent @tedcruz
@resurgent Slave Symbol. Maybe we should tear down New York simply because slaves helped build the North.
@resurgent Besides Dr. King & Mr. Obama having dreams, I've had dreams, but no one gave a shit. So I stopped having them. #NewAmerica 
@resurgent @tedcruz #tedcruz
@resurgent @tedcruz
@resurgent @tedcruz MLK is now a caricature used by the Left. His real teachings are forgotten, his Christianity erased.
@idnov @resurgent @tedcruz Lest we forget: the Clintons were first to bring up issue with Obama. Why are they never accused of as racist?
@idnov @pulpstress @resurgent @tedcruz i believe Bill Clinton is white.
@resurgent @tedcruz Judge by character,, not the color of their skin.. Means just as much more today than it ever did actually
