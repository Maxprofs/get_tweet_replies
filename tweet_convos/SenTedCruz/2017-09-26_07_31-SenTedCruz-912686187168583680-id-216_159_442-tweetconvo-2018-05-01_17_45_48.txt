What bullshit. Read capital in the 21st century. That voodoo growth routine is corny.  Wow. Hire new writers. Your material stinks.
What about Veterans, you Failhttps://youtu.be/Tm280UvAi8s
Top priority should be helping people keep more of their money. End surcharges NOW thieves. Your creating regular people into criminals
Tax reform won't help people avoid getting shot at movie theaters, holiday parties, and concerts. Pass gun control policy.

I'm British. I don't get why Americans can get machine guns but not universal healthcare.

More details on Cambridge Analytica "legacy" Cruz psychometrics and voter file enrichment models passed on to Trump http://wapo.st/1lZoVCP

I wonder how the #GOP & #Cruz feel about using racism and hatred to get votes. Is it okay to encourage the alt-right or #Klan? chirping.

America belongs to the people. Not the special interests.

Here's why @BetoORourke vs. @TedCruz is nationally important. #BetoForTexas 
The great state of Texas has to dry out and rebuild. Grow up. Grow a pair.

I'm not sure everyone fully grasps yet that GOP tax plan is actually cutting Medicare and Medicaid. That's how they pay for it.

#TEXANS- This guy is from the government and he's here to help. See below, and call him to share your opinion please
I am sure you get yours but the middle class certainly not get one. the Billionaires they will get theirs first. Who called you lying Ted??
No you REALLY JUST PASS THE BUCK -
Transparency is #taxfairness in #taxreform. 

JUST release @realdonaldjtrump tax returns as a good faith action for believability.
How about The Swamp STOPPING THE THEFT. $21 TRILLION AND COUNTING.  BREAKING TODAY:
Your seat is up for grabs in 2018. Fight for Puerto Rico.
We have to do it right. The current plan still kills those in the middle class really trying to make it to the next level. I'm for cutting all deductions if you get to a 15% Flat Tax rate. Also going to hurt biz investment with the higher brackets proposed.
I follow your stance but there'd BE more jobs w/ #aca GONE. It cost my draftsman his job & his whole family's health ins-bankrupt-gotta go!
Taxation with uncaring Representation.
No my kitchen is going to cost more this doesn't work for me checked a car to Mr Cohn is out of touch rich don't need to get richer
Have no cap on SS tax, tax breaks allow the wealthy to shield their income and pay less in percentage than average worker. End Ethanol sub
@SenTedCruz call it what it is. tax cuts on the rich, while raising taxes on the poor and middle class.
What plan does that...not the current one....don't you want a 52% tax rate?
Yes sir
Why wont they make a SOCIAL MEDIA PROFITS TAX of 75% on Fake Book, Goofle, YayPoo, & others. It would raise 380 billion a year & hit Leftist
As a middle class American & disabled veteran, the State property taxes removal will negatively impact. Increase my taxes by $2,100. Help!
Agree next Health Care please speak out more citizens need unity this division killing us agree 2 get us out this Hate politics build moral
House 200 bills Senate ZERO, Get off your self Righteous Trump hating asses and DO YOUR DAMN JOBS or lose them
Lowering taxes does not increase jobs. CEOs make millions to keep wages and benefits LOW. Lowering their taxes will only help the .001

Is this another bill that will die in the senate . Come on people, get something completed
This is just a HUGE tax break for his wealth donors and himself.  Here's what he really thinks of his constituents:
Love the video it explains it all.
The great state of Texas can lead the way, because of the strong Conservative Leadership Texas has in office. @GregAbbott_TX #CRUZ2018
Please repeal the Jones Act. PR will rebound faster.
NO GROWTH because YOU voted against revamping Obamacare
Trickle down economics doesn't work take the money out of the rich give it to the gov and re-distributed to the middle class and poor.
NO!!!  $21 TRILLION IN THEFT DOESN'T WORK!!! BREAKING TODAY!!!  DRAIN THAT SWAMP:
Gotta be on that Trump Train or its Repeal and Replaced.  GOP vs Trump is a no contest. MAGA 2020 goes Trump Trump Trump
Maybe you could tout the fairy tale numbers with the magic beans of dynamic scoring to support this tax cut for the wealthy?
EXTREMELY UNHAPPY about proposed tax " reform" Looks like 100-200,000 tax INCREASE BIG TIME. Not fair at all
Faulty reasoning and incorrect conclusions

U support cutting $ Medicaid AND voted for Price who uses tax $ for private jets?  Ur priorities? Start Reform by cutting Jet spending
You are just a lazy, non-Trump supporting loser. GET SOMETHING DONE FOR THE PEOPLE!
Trickle down economics (aka voodoo economics) doesn't work. Never has. Never will. Stop lying.
Only idiots would raise taxes on the wealthy
Ah huh and what about expats who use no services in the US, are you going to support Americans abroad?
You need to vote on repealing health care, so you're on the record.  We need to know who needs to go or stay.  Push for a vote. @FoxNews
What the hell has happened to you Ted Cruz? Supported you through your campaign and now nothing! Have you abandoned conservatism?
Ted cruz is full of shit...
What the American ppl want is gov out of healthcare and all u to be put on Obamacare! Son has O had to pay 4 his girls surgery & ins payment
hey how are we gonna get America out of debt how are we going to make new buildings, think ted think
Please lord send me a replacement for Cruz. Someone that isn’t an embarrassing opportunist. Thanks for nothing Teddy
And healthcare. Deductible sky high, premium sky high. AND I lost my plan AND my doctor. Smh.
Then do something!
No it was repeal and replace O C as you prom. but as usual you did not deliver Rafael your real name (pobre el hijo que se caga n su nido)
As a senator you have lost my Texas vote going forward
I would like to know WHY you have decided NOT to support Graham/Cassidy. Your Twitter page doesn't seem to address it. Another McCain?
You guys couldn't deliver on your promise to repeal Obamacare.  You really think you can get this done.  I am voting opposite next time.
Meanwhile Texas horse racing is about to loose 300000 jobs because of the Texas racing commission and keeping casinos out of Texas.
Typical need for attention, Cruz. You just endorsed OCARE
Trickle down economics has never worked for the middle class. Only for the rich - FACT. But most #GOP voters only hear "#jobs" & get aroused
Joke...... Nobody has faith in anything GOP says they will do.
Many economists agree that #trickledown #economics are a lie. It's like Forrest Gump's $1M wound, is more idiomatic than truth.
Knowing u & the rest of the corrupt Never Trumpers nothing will happen re taxes. New republicans must be elected to clean the corruption
U all will find a way to not provide tax cuts for the middle class. U will find a way NOT to lower taxes on Corp & repatriation of $ oversea
u haven't  gotten over the ass kicking from Trump. There was no reason other than Hate & Jealousy to not vote for GC HC Bill. No Reason!
I am very disappointed Ted was grouped with Rand, Susan and John, do not follow their lead. Lack of action for on Healthcare is a failure.
Get on board with potus kill obamacare or lose my vote
All you republicans are punishing Americans with Obamacare just because you hate Trump . I hope you all get voted out in 2018
@tedcruz What about healthcare?!?
Fix health care....
I could have voted for a Democrat and ended up with obamacare
Translation: Give corporations a tax break under guise of job creation. Call it "trickle down economics!" Didn't work the first time, Cruz!
Repeal Obamacare like you promised Senator!
You couldn't sell us health care reform and replace, so now you expect us to believe you are in the same camp with us? I think NOT!
If you like your junk, you can keep your junk
People wanted relief from obamacare, but go ahead and make some tax cuts so all the money gets fed into the govt system....single payer wins
It doesn't create #jobs and you know it. #TaxReform like this just makes rich people richer.
#LyingTed #corruption is your name
We care about Healthcare with jobs! Not jobs without healthcare! You need to be on Obamacare!
Republicans or Democrats do your job for Healthcare! Americans need it!
I would appreciate them not stealing from us as well.  BREAKING TODAY:
Top priority is healthcare with those jobs! We have jobs...Why can't you do what Texans voted you in to do? Get it together!
They have great insurance so their not going to repeal Obamacare because they just don't care about us .

Hey here is an idea....make a power point on how you plan to solve the issues with the VA?  Only 30% of Vets enrolled because of Politics!
Federal sales tax. Dismantle the IRS.
Then make a bipartisan effort, and for once, you might succeed!
Thank you Mr Cruz for contnuing to clarify this. I agree overtaxing takes away from working people and businesses, leaving less for growth.
I don't believe you anymore. We are now stuck with ObamaCare.
Blessings be!
But your plan only helps the top 10% of the country what about 90%
Texas deserves better than Cruz
Repeat after me and every credible economist: Tax cuts do not create a single job or raise a single wage! Voodoo in '80, voodoo now.
Ted your cooked
You know there is no correlation between tax cuts and economic/job growth, right?
What? You’re not talking about Obamacare Repeal anymore? You already dismissed it?
All talk and no action, you are like the rest of them!
Ummm those two mean very little to Texas Veterans to weak to work thus no tax issues.  You got anything for Veterans? Or do you join M.P. ??
If you want to boost jobs through tax policy, then why aren't you promoting the #FairTax?
Learn how #FAIRtax effects the economy  http://bit.ly/28YEQhT . @WaysandMeansGOP @WaysMeansCmte explain how cutting a rate is #TaxReform 
How can you propose tax reform? The senate republicans after seven plus years cannot pass a health care bill. Failure is not option!!! 
Cruz, McCain, Mcconnel have NO INTENTION of passing any of trump agenda. All that money oversea's will stay there, new Reps must be elected!
There better be more jobs for people to pay their health insurance or penalty all because you people won't get it together. Disgusting.
BETO OROURKE IN 2018!!
Why talk about tax cuts you'll probably vote No all talk no action
Jobs ??  You see those help wanted signs all over the state....
Wrong. Top priority is getting that crazy person out of the WH
Sen Ted, please REVERSE ICANN!!
It's been documented Corporate tax reductions DO NOT bring jobs-  It just pays your rich contributors. But you don't like facts or real data
turn your fax and email on @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @TxBlackDemocrat @indtx36 @Indivisible_TX @DFWIndivisible
You just now realizing this?
Lots of talk Senator. No action on healthcare and still no action on taxes.
IF YOUR SO CONCERNED ...THEN HAVE TX CALL A SPECIAL SESSIONS TO RAISE STATE MIM WAGE,RELEASE FUNDS FOR GEN.F TO CREATE JOBS.
INVESTIGATE THE STATE LOTTERY COMMISSION.HAVE POLITICIANS SHOW COMPLETE FUNDS RECEIVED BY OUTSIDE THE STATE .I CAN GO ON
We don't want you're tax reform. We don't trust you and your shady bill.
Your proposal will benefit the wealthiest, the people paying you how much? Forget it. You aren't fighting for US.
Just think how much money could be put into the pockets if the people by reducing healthcare costs. Please initiate a plan to get this done.
@SenTedCruz Sen what would your tax plan be?
#RepealandReplace Ted! Get on board!!!
Ur voting to keep O Care. We will NEVER forget!
Forgive me if I don't trust Republicans.
Couldn’t agree more.  I don’t trust Dems...we can see where the last 8 years got us.
PEOPLE ARE DYING IN PUERTO RICO.
I hear that there is an open casting call for a sexually frustrated ignorant senator for an upcoming porno for blind folks...That's a job!
Be a loyal republican and you might have a political future.
No vote for Cruz if he votes no on healthcare!
I thought texas was rick's miracle  tax reform does nothing for jobs
You Republicans can’t get anything done. See if you can get Harry Reid to switch parties and come back as leader/if you pay him he will come
Can we get tax reform done? Will McCain vote against that too
Rs still pushing the ole trickle down, supply side economics theory that has never worked. Just a "take from poor and give to rich" scheme.
Listen Spanky, giving tax cuts to the top 1% is almost as bad as whacking it to Twitter porn. Do something that actually helps people
Cutting taxes for multi millionaires and billionaires won't do a damn thing to help the working people of this country so don't try it
Vote for the HC Bill Senator...
Top priority?
Trump destroys institutions and threatens war but you're pushing Tax Cuts?
As a small business owner I am once again faced with 20% mark up to health insurance premiums.  What other industry allows this?
Top priority is getting the crazy man out of the White House! And #SaveOurCare -People will die under graham cassidy aka Trumpcare
#paymypremium Senator since you won’t vote
 ANYONE fall for that?Uwant Tax Cut for the rich.Families/Small Business PAYfor that.HenceThe ripped "UsedToBe" Middle Class.
You lost.  Why don't you help @POTUS to achieve tax reform for Texans?
"Offshoring funds", "tax havens", "shell companies", "corporate welfare cheats"..say it, Ted, say it!
Not to mention....  BREAKING TODAY:
Sure, but tax cuts that leave a yawning deficit is bad economics, because they don’t make enough offsetting growth. Easy to cut taxes.
Ted Cruz’s Twitter and the mainstream appeal of incest porn http://nydn.us/2y0bAAD 
We're living the nightmare of the last tax plan. The past 30+ yrs slow salary growth, no pension plan, a recession, etc. & #TheRichProsper

Ok.
