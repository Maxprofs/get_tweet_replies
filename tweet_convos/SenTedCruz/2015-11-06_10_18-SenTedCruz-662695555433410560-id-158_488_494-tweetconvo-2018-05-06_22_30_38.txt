@Prescott67 @SenTedCruz Lisa, please don't tell me you are a Climate Hoaxster. Is your livelihood contingent on taxpayer funded Govt Grants?
Is that your invalid assumption? @ConserValidity @SenTedCruz
@Prescott67 @SenTedCruz Lisa, as all Climate Hoax Marxists, you must avoid facts and attack the messenger. Have you no shame?
Wow! Chris, 2 out of 2 tweets from you, and both in error. Now, I'm a Marxist? Try again. :) @ConserValidity @SenTedCruz
@Prescott67 Obviously you're a victim of our nation's current education system.Hence I accept the fact you can't support your climate drivel
@ConserValidity Current education system? Wrong again! Three strikes, you're out!
@Prescott67 Please stop posting me.

@SenTedCruz @POTUS yes!!! So glad he is! At least someone is thinking about taking care of our earth.. #agenda or not.
@juliatomtania @SenTedCruz 0bama takes care of our earth as he jets around in Air Force One, to golf courses which drink up needed water?!
@arrowsmithwoman @SenTedCruz this is about God's great earth, not your vendetta on Obama. Whoever our next POTUS is, we still have to care.
@SenTedCruz At least people vote for him.  No  One  Likes  You
@pete_forester Are you referring to dead people and illegals, Pete? @SenTedCruz
@Texgalleslie @SenTedCruz I'm referring to national polls that puts Ted Cruz behind major GOP candidates and both leading Dem candidates.
@pete_forester He's #4 almost #3....and rising. Better keep your eyes open. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz I am grateful that we have a president who considers the future and the actual facts of climate change. FYI it does exists!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS - Dirty power we don't need for money for the 1%. Bad for the environment, Texas, and the U.S. You mad bro?
@SenTedCruz what is your favourite grimes song
@SenTedCruz @POTUS keeping our planet habitable is more important than any reason to harvest dirty carbon. Obama is right. Tar sands bad!

@SenTedCruz @POTUS yes, preserving the environment is "radical." Selling one's soul to the oil companies is far more conservative.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS absolutely can't think for himself
@SenTedCruz radical environmentalist agenda? Seriously? You are so drastically out of touch.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you have a radical agenda that serves no one
@SenTedCruz @POTUS "Radical," how radical all those people are who dare to like breathing and drinking water
@SenTedCruz @POTUS he's not controlled by them, he is them
@SenTedCruz @POTUS #ClimateChangeDenial is #extremism and is an Earth issue, not a left issue. Your views are radical, dangerous, and wrong.
@SenTedCruz Has nothing to do w/environment. Has everything to do with Warren Buffet's trains that currently ship the crude.
@SenTedCruz @DEMAGOGSSUCK @POTUS And Warren Buffet.. George Soros more like it
@KonniBurton @SenTedCruz @POTUS Which is ironic,  as the oil will now go onto ship to be burned in China via dirtier methods. More Co2.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  To Cruz, anybody who ever rode a bicycle is a radical environmentalist.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Cant we get an overide on Potus' rejection of the pipeline?

.@SenTedCruz 

I so hope you're smart enough to fool the GOP voters because it would be a pleasure to watch Hillary roll right over you.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Yes sir he does. And it is destroying Americans
@SenTedCruz @POTUS the funny thing is the environmentalists dont think about the fact that the oil is now shipped on trains.
@SenTedCruz "radical environmentalist agenda" lmfaooooo

@SenTedCruz you are spot on, Senator!  I wonder what the pipe fitters Union thinks about this decision?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Buffet and Berkshire own the BNR railroad that ships the oil.
@SenTedCruz the words radical and agenda should never be spoken in contempt of another, until you, @realDonaldTrump and Dr. Ben stop as well
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 2 days after Transcnda withdraws application. Lots of press, but it's an AIRBALL
@SenTedCruz and you're controlled by corporate greed.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Keystone XL rejection a nod to Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway who owns BNSF which transports the oil
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama's protecting Buffet's millions, who owns the trains. Disregards environmental issues with train wreck spills.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS not only is keystone an economic boost but also a national security measure  The POTS is an epic blooming idiotic
@SenTedCruz @POTUS, actually he is controlled by his own delusion.
@SenTedCruz  You should read some Green Eggs and Ham and calm your nerves. Bravo @POTUS #NoKXL
@SenTedCruz @POTUS yeah Ted it's so radical to reject having a massive environmental hazard cutting through the country. Damn tree huggers!
