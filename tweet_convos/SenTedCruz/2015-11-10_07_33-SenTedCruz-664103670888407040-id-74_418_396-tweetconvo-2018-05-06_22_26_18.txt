@SenTedCruz It won't help, EURO antisemitism is stronger.
@kabalissima Why criticizing Israel's policies get you labeled as "antisemitic"? Is it to silence the criticisms?
@Liberal_Mojo because: http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm …
@kabalissima Nothing convencing in your link. Please read my previous link to know why EU are labeling some Israeli products.
@Liberal_Mojo Why should I exchange views with a moron who doesn't understand plain English?
@kabalissima Dodging the topic again? If you criticize for example China's policies, I will call you anti-Sino? How stupid is that.
@SenTedCruz thank senator Cruz. True friend of Israel
@Ekon12345  Why get irritated and angry about having to declare the origin of your products? Read this: http://news.yahoo.com/eu-approves-labelling-israel-settlement-products-102302684.html …
@SenTedCruz I am sure the people of  #Israel thank god every day they elected a man like you to represent them.
@egbee @SenTedCruz Cruz ws only 1 of 36 senators who signed the letter.  
The fact that u choose 2 pick on Cruz exclusively shows ur party.
@ProudPatriot @SenTedCruz Awww don't let your feefees get hurt but what are you showing when you can only defend the person not the policy?
@TiaraSyst Why would any one sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only. They are not elected by Israelis.
@SenTedCruz     why aren't all the congress signatures on this document.......
@patriot1944 @SenTedCruz it's sad that something that is clearly bipartisan didn't get more to sign on, if Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer are
@MendyWax @patriot1944 @SenTedCruz  Maybe because the of rest law makers are not puppets of Israel. Our politicians should focus on US only.
@Liberal_Mojo @patriot1944  so you want to be an isolationist?
@MendyWax No dear Mendy. I like Cruz but he is wrong on this one. It's between Israel & EU, not us. 
Please read ..
@Liberal_Mojo I don't need to read some biased BBC opinion peice! This will actually hurt the Arabs more then the Israelis, but it's the...
@SenTedCruz thanks, Senator.
@RussDeCastro221 Why would anyone sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only. They R not elected by Israelis.
@SenTedCruz @PatVPeters  #liberals #Democrats  are #Insane So are their voter base!  #IStandWithIsrael  #ArrestObama
@SenTedCruz I question how many other conservatives actually signed the letter?
@SenTedCruz Freaking shame. 
Only 35? Jews who support democrats are using the liberal suicide clause
@mrdavidswilliam Why would any one sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only.They R not elected by Israelis.
@Liberal_Mojo and doing a pretty shitty job by all accounts.
@SenTedCruz @PatVPeters Nice to see my vote for Burr wasn't totally wasted.
@SenTedCruz @pjamesjp1
@SenTedCruz re: the EU's Israel labelling plan, isn't this done to other countries (Made in China)? Seems a total nonissue & a poor priority
@azrogue It's hypocritical too. They are labeling products that were made in occupied lands. Read this:
@SenTedCruz With all the problems America faces right now, Ted Cruz digs in on a EU labeling issue. This shows he's not qualified to be Pres
@JamesJa15494083 noone ask u to fund Cruz but its important we support Israel. @SenTedCruz proven his commitment to fight for this country.
@MichaelYarnell2 @SenTedCruz Fight? They push us into wars with their enemies. Cruz (and you?) willing to risk troops' lives but not his own
@JamesJa15494083 u make no sense, Im saying he is fighting for our rights and security, Israel shld b included in our interests @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz why not 100 senators?
@mech1125 Why would any one sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only.They R not elected by Israelis.
@Liberal_Mojo Then why does our president try so hard to destroy Israel's sovereignty?
@SenTedCruz sadly there are Jews  weho support BDS. That is suicide! Thank you Senator Cruz.
@SenTedCruz I am deeply disappointed not to see @SenMikeLee 's signature.
@Tab1791 Why would anyone sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only. They are not elected by Israelis.
@Liberal_Mojo Israel is and has been our Ally!
@SenTedCruz why only 36? I am shocked it's not 100.
@SenTedCruz What's wrong with people making their own decision based on factual information.Why do you want to hide where a product is made?
@SenTedCruz 

Try not to break the Logan Act this time, Rafael.
#CruzCrew
@SenTedCruz @cathyspartanj @realDonaldTrump Excellent!
@SenTedCruz thank you for standing up to outright anti Semitic and anti Israel policies. Jews and Israel are not the problem. Islamists are
@MYOHMYreal  Why would anyone sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only. They are not elected by Israelis.
@SenTedCruz I AGREE WITH YOU TED CRUZ
@lindanye6615 Why would any one sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only.They R not elected by Israelis.
@SenTedCruz What is the reason the others do not sign?
@frednova Because of this:
@vaaggie86 It's already labeled. What Europeans R labeling are products made in occupied lands. Read this:
@SSC1974 It's non of our business. It's between Israel & EU. Our politicians should focus on US only. They are not elected by Israelis.
Um, @SenCapito, why isn't your signature on this letter? @SenTedCruz
@ir0nw1l Why would anyone sign it or care about it? Our politicians should focus on US affairs only. They are not elected by Israelis.
@Liberal_Mojo because having allies around that world that share our values brings added protections!
@SenTedCruz Isn't this letter inherently an attempt to infringe on a foreign nations sovereignty? How would you respond to such a request?
@SenTedCruz only 36. That is disgraceful
@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber thank you
@SenTedCruz You guys have denied basic rights to Palestinians. You provide F-16 to fight against Stones. 2000:2 ratio is of deaths. Shame
@SenTedCruz So just to win your elections & money from lobbies in US, you want #EU to change their rules for a tiny hostile state? Kudos 
@SenTedCruz What a d00shb@g you are.
@SenTedCruz Might want to get back to counting on the fingers. I see 22 signatures here.
@SenTedCruz I dub thee "shoe-shit."5/6 top posts on your page about Israel, but you can't memorize U.S policy: http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/259777-cruz-stumbles-recall-federal-agencies-hed-cut …
@SenTedCruz I hope EU spits on their urges. I do not support a #warcriminal
@SenTedCruz ;Thank you Mr. Cruz, for all you, and the other 35 Senators, for supporting Israel!!!
@SenTedCruz @HotNostrilsrFun maybe Israel could withhold the drugs they make from any country that boycotts them
@JimW_in_NM What drugs? Most of effective and cheap drugs are made in South Asian countries. Our politicians should focus on US only.
@SenTedCruz @jongery I'm glad our senators are spending their working hours taking on issues that affect our lives here in the US so much!!!
@SenTedCruz only 36?
@SenTedCruz Please shut up ! my country is not your country! Are you serious !
your politic is genocidal Indian,your peaple,Irak Afga,Syria
@SenTedCruz The anti-semitic, pro Islamist EU aka Germany is still trying to destroy Israel. The Nazis still control #Europe! @EU_Commission
@SenTedCruz If anything, that'll just encourage them. If there's anything like a dare it's US Senators telling Eurocrats what to do.
@SenTedCruz Thank you, Senator Cruz...Keep up the good fight!
@SenTedCruz As the great 1Mark Levin ?s; where is McConnell, McCain, Graham, Hatch....Because, this letter was Cruz's idea? Or....
@SenTedCruz Why is the GOP always on the wrong side of history? We evolve, not devolve! Take care of your Party. Listen to DIVERSE Americans
@SenTedCruz @ImSweetieBelle What business it is of ours?
@SenTedCruz no we need to boycott Israel stop sending my tax dollars to them.
@SenTedCruz why was country of origin labeling taken away by Congress
@SenTedCruz ..#useless #senator
@SenTedCruz Europe has a dark history when it comes to Jews and labeling. At least someone is willing to call them out this time
@SenTedCruz and people say nothing can get through congress...
@SenTedCruz Is this really the most important item on a United States Senators agenda? Really? #wastedsenateseat
AMEN @SenTedCruz #StandWithIsrael
@SenTedCruz Instead of worrying about Israel why don't you do the job you were elected to do and work on American issues.
@SenTedCruz I support BDEU
This why, how #history repeats itself. Vision of this flag 4th time ,Is it German?.  #WW3 
  @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Un Wants 2 Boycott Israel ? Whaaat Close There Frigging Building Hey Ya Close UN !!!!!!!
