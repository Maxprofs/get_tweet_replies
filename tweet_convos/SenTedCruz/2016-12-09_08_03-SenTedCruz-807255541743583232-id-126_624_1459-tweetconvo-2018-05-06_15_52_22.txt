much needed
I assume you are talking about a constitutional amendment. SCOTUS overthrew Newt's term limits 20 years ago.
@carolinagirl63 @SenTedCruz yes, thanks to Trump for wanting term limits.
OMG you Trumpkins are clueless. Cruz has been talking abt this much longer.
we know this moron but he isn't president
I know this moron but I get sick of Trumpkins thinking Trump was the first at everything.
I get it Cruz was my first choice but you can't cry about it
I'm not crying. I'm pointing out hypocrisy.
No #TermLimits. Need #TortReform and medical doctors, business owners & x-military making laws  - not lawyers.
So you're going to waste time showboating instead of doing what we elected Trump to do?
Trump isn't doing what you elected him to do.
I have no idea what you're replying to, but Trump isn't in office yet
He has reneged on all the silly promises he made to the Cult.
Oh Geeze, I thought you were a serious person.  Goodbye
Great proposal,  keep pushing until it passes
that's why I voted for you
@MarieMa49685063 @SenTedCruz   Congress will not limit themselves. We need a Conv of States Amend. Also no life time appts
Repeal the 17th Amendment along with term limits.
.@johncornyn @farenthold Please support. 
@RepDeSantis @SenTedCruz
As soon as the 115th Congress convenes, @SenTedCruz & I will move to restore accountability by introducing #TermLimits.
I want all elected officials to resign all org memberships upon taking office.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz is this a bi-partisan issue? Seems like it's something we can all agree on.
When?
Id like to see this pass..but remain cautiously pessimistic. Why not throw tort reform rider in?
forget about #termlimits, get rid of all those ridiculous perks.
Where is this promise? #TermLimits
What will we do without the decades-long obsolescence of Reid, Biden,Boxer ?
@pinkbiscuit @SenTedCruz APPLAUSE!!!
That should shake up some lifers
yes Term limits! Now u are onto something!
@KORANISBURNING @SenTedCruz with term limits will there be a pay change implemented?
like a severance or retirement packets versus lifetime payroll?
Its a start to getting Americans to TRUST you again but it will take many more items including donation control
I disagree. here is a different way to solve the problem of career politicians.
@hectormorenco @SenTedCruz Congress will not vote themselves out of power Need Convention of states  Balanced budget too

Please, please, please, get it done, drain the swamp, ensure it is irreversible. Make them shorter.
@hectormorenco @SenTedCruz looking forward to hearing how that's a Russian plot.
we have term limits already we the people decide like it or not!
and there needs to be a disrecognition of the Supreme Court's mis-interpretation of the costitution
@tedcruz yes
@USTermLimits @SenTedCruz present lawmakers may need to be exempted from the new limits  
In the long run same result
'Serving' country in a political position shouldn't be a 'career'! Wouldn't be issue if they actually did their job
But doesn't it take a Constitutional amendment 2/3 to do it. Dems will never go for it, they love the pwr 2 much.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz we shall see
@BushwackCA @SenTedCruz And will there be support among your colleagues?
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/RepDeSantis/status/807254384761602053 … (Ranked 1st for Dec 9.)
A convention of the States might work better
It's about time! We should also reduce senate terms to 4 years, and allow voters to recall members of Congress.
Let's play "which states will oppose"...I say NY, IL, CA, MA, WA, OR. 38 states needed to ratify if my math is 
, thank you!! It'll be hilarious to watch McConnell freak out over it 
excellent!
You should also be pushing to repeal the 17 Amendment if you want to drain the swamp
Convention of states can do that
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz good, and I think you will find a majority of Americans support term limits.
ahahahaha accountability. From you guys? Tell us another.
Show accountability by Blocking  a corrupt Mitt Romney SOS please that's a huge start.
BLOCK corrupt Mitt Romney as a SOS.. he's corrupt.. we will hold all votes accountable.. Over the line.
@CruzCrewNewEng @SenTedCruz I wish you much success Representative DeSantis.
@tedcruz why did McConnell and congress allow Dems to control FCC more censorship ? This is bs
@Tamaralynn212 @RepDeSantis @tedcruz 

I was reading a lot on this, what is your source.
http://ln.is/morningconsult.com/a/cABDJ …
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz TERM LIMITS & NO LIFETIME BENEFITS. Serve only 8 yrs like POTUS. Then voting every 8 yrs. Vets need beneft
@averageUSgirl @SenTedCruz Need TERM LIMITS no more CAREER POLITICIANS can't do Countries business can't get along
MUCH ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDED,RESTORE THE CONSTITUTION!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz another idea would be to base elected officials pay on the state average they represent & housing provided
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz the term limits bill needs to include no lobbying for at least six years after leaving office!
.. should it fail (expect it will)add a line ~ "not supporting this, is a sign 2 States 4 an Article V Convention
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Thank you for coming home #MAGA. MERRY Christmas.
Good luck. What we really need is an #Article5 Convention @COSProject
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Does that mean you gentlemen will not run in 2018? #putyourmoneywhereyourmouthis
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz This is the change America needs.
@judyrademacher2 @SenTedCruz that's a drop the mic moment
@RestoreHistory @SenTedCruz Introduce term limits for bureaucrats first!
@RestoreHistory @SenTedCruz Who really believes they'll fight to limit their own ability to stay in power? Come on now.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz excuse me, we already have term limits. They're called...... "elections?" 
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz hope this passes.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz -Good move, should have been done a hundred years ago.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz what term limits are you proposing?
Good luck, it's tough to give up that power.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz 
Here is the same old s*** just do something. Stop using those same old,political,s***, words.
dueshbag Mcconnel already said he woudnt bother to take up term limits in senate. Good luck
@tedcruz i am against term limits.  Hurts small states.
How do you figure that it hurts small states?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz I don't know how many times you guys have to hear it – we have term limits, it's called voting. Geesh
Why are you restricting my right to elect whom I please?
The 2 of you are undemocratic and must resign

@RepDeSantis @tedcruz @SenTedCruz
You go boy!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz I hope it is not a show but you will do it for real tooth and nail! Go guys!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz I wish you luck at getting that done! Great idea as it'd keep ideas fresh & not so corrupted by PAC's!! 
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz ...That will truly be a MIRACLE if #TermLimits is put into effect. I'm not holding my breath though.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz sounds great. Trump hit on procurement not working for suppliers..trillion dollars saved.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz Great news! 

Also a good lobbing reform bill is needed to stop under-the-table-monies from flowing
Go kick some butt!  It's our time!
@carolinagirl63 @SenTedCruz YES!  Please do!
my reaction to the op-ed. Let's do it
Much needed and long awaited reform.  Fight like hell to make it happen!
thank you I fully support term limits
excellent!!! I  can always count on you being on the right side mr DeSantis. As usual I proudly support you
Until then, it's business as usual, folks.
Yes, please. Take Trump's #TermLimits proposal and push that shit through Congress. Ty. @SenTedCruz
please let's us know what we can do to push this forward and make it law!
Looking forward to see what a great job will be done for America! Thank you!
I you dont limit terms @COSProject will.
Good, let's get you two clowns out and drain the swamp. Cruz is a professional whiner. Doesn't do nada. #LyinTed
@BresPolitico @SenTedCruz that's via Constitutional Amendment, right? You know you can't just pass a law?
@GordonPress @SenTedCruz Congress sold Veterans  to big Parmacy No Benzos for anxiety only anti-psychotics #DontDrinktheKoolaid
We'd appreciate that. At least get rid of those who are there for thirty/forty/fifty years!!! That's insanity!
- Yes with salary caps and eliminate 'perks' from severance packages - No one should leave a millionaire
Does the proposal account for and mitigate the inevitable rise of a permanent bureaucratic class? #TermLimits
Sure you will. The Kochs haven't spent billions buying the Republican Party so this will pass no problem! Morons
It'll pass. I dont think you learend much from the 2016 election. @RepDeSantis @SenTedCruz
Finally Ted Cruz is going to do something meaningful as senator, only took 2 years, must be a big learning curve.
Grandstand play with no chance of passing..
@MitchMcConell @SpeakerRyan @GOP Thanks DeSantis and Cruz!Rest of U better do same or voters will drain you in 2018
GOOD!!
Hope he suceeds. For all of our sakes.
Hell yeah. Do this!
that is excellent news. #draintheswamp
congress agreeing to term limits is like illegal aliens leaving US without force. Free rides are hard to give up!
The #TermLimits bill won't affect current Congressman, only incoming. That's why it'll pass @RepDeSantis @SenTedCruz
thank you
please and thank you. this would be awesome!
A good idea, but just a feel good moment. Has absolutely NO chance of success. Waste of time and money.
Why? @RepDeSantis @SenTedCruz
Would you vote to cut your paycheck? Probably not. And they're not going to either.
Nobody is getting a paycheck cut? The term limits bill Trump wants to pass only affects incoming
@RepDeSantis @SenTedCruz
It wont affect any1 currently there. Its a constitutional amendment to make sure futurw congressmen have limits
@RepDeSantis
