You know that it took SCIENCE & SCIENTISTS to achieve this goal, right? Yet, the GOP bastards consistently cut education funding
You could have shown some courage last night and endorsed Trump like you pledged to do. Do pledges not mean anything to you?
you have a lot of courage, one vote closer to allowing our next president to be Hillary Clinton.  Disgraceful!
@tedcruz Ted -- you gave your word. No if's and's or but's --- :/ sad day for you Ted. You lost your moral character last night.
anything to say about this?

I blocked Ted. He is a selfish man.
Another thing that the media CLEARLY, forgot to mention. Was that: Pres Lincoln was a BLACK PRESIDENT
May be the reason you lost the primary vote. Maybe many people saw that you were not a man of your word & did not vote for you
Too bad you don't have the courage to pick yourself back up off the floor and fight for America again! U lost my vote last night
