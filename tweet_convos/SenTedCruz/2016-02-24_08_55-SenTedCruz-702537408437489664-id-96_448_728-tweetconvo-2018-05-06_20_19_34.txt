@SenTedCruz You're not even a real Texan.  I love Texans, but you are a Canadian.  Right?  At least until 2014 I understand.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz i can't understand what he wrote lol
Travis said,"The 4000-6000 enemy want surrender on their terms. When the cannon answered, Santa Anna said."Deguelo" (ALL DIE!)
@SenTedCruz WHY DID YOU GUYS DO THIS, DID YOU ALSO BLOCK THE EPA CLEAN WATER BILL TOO.
@DarlenePelico @SenTedCruz since it all repubs listed and no Dems it was prob attached to a bill that was bad so you kill the whole package
Things that harm us do not need to be in a package. As much as we pay all of them they meed do a better job .
@SenTedCruz   'VICTORY or DEATH' letter. Ironic; Senator Cruz as POTUS or DEATH to AMERICA.
Cruz-Rubio good stopper- bad stopper later which was which? Supposed to forget & forgive HOW? Never saw such slimeba
By being a REALIST. Cruz/Rubio NOT option. IF Hitlery, USA WILL BE MARXIST NATION! IF Trump, MAYBE USA survives.
I'll vote for MAYBE as it's my ONLY OPTION! At least if USA survives, we'll still have a shot at a CONSERVATIVE PREZ
IF Hitlery, they'll NEVER BE a shot at getting a Conservative Prez; we may NOT EVEN be able to VOTE anymore!
@nifkinjuice @SenTedCruz They Lost. The British Lost. Get over it.
@nifkinjuice @SenTedCruz  It's History,  Turned out well. Mexico is still screwed up.
@nifkinjuice @SenTedCruz  Was, you can't adjust to changes in History, you cannot comprehend current events, incapable of intelligent convo.
Sure would be nice if you crossed the gOPe & backed TRUMP helping with landslide
Ya snaked Trump by dissing him & reniging on endorsement promised with laimo excuse."He tacked familia!" & Estab no?
@SenTedCruz Who cares Ted!!! WE want Trump!

@SenTedCruz TED CRUZ! THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS PROVEN HIS RECORD AND HIS STAND AGAINST WDC IN THE PAST IS BEST CHOICE FOR POTUS
@SenTedCruz I didn't see in the letter where Travis blamed Obama. Figured that's why you were tweeting it.

@SenTedCruz do you look in the mirror and realize what a sociopath you really are?
@SenTedCruz you know you are not a Texan, right?
@SenTedCruz Did he write it in the basement?
@SenTedCruz I'm gonna call you Alamoses
@SenTedCruz true Texans love this document not use it for political points.

@SenTedCruz @jdfreedomsfirst Very little is known about Travis, but we know one thing: he did his duty bravely and well #ccot #tcot
@SenTedCruz Who gives a crap. Babies are poisoned in Flint 2016
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump It needs better protection.
@SenTedCruz now were all but handed it over to em on a silver platter. . .
#RemembertheAlamo
@SenTedCruz Ted, You ain't Travis  or any of the defenders. They had guts and principals.
@SenTedCruz George Clymer was one of the founding fathers of this great country... And the signer of the Declaration of Independence.
@SenTedCruz And the Constitution...I know you can make our country what MY father would want and what our founding fathers would want Thanks
@SenTedCruz I have something dear to me also... My dad served in the United States Navy for 20 years on the USS George Clymer. He has passed
@SenTedCruz Remember the Alamo
@SenTedCruz exactly Charlie, obviously dude is a paid problem starter, and not worth the time or effort to have a conversation with
@SenTedCruz Rafael, hush, you lost.
@SenTedCruz Long Live the great state of Texas!  Vote Ted Cruz POTUS 2016!
@SenTedCruz  " under siege" ...like America is now.... HELP !!!

@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz GO TED! 2016!
@BayAreaCarlito @SenTedCruz is only going DOWN!
@SenTedCruz tweeting about a Texas hero will not make you a Texas hero by association. Did Glenn Beck tell you who William Travis was?
@GoodbyeMoon_Man @SenTedCruz  Bill O'Reilly was there ask him!   @oreillyfactor

@SenTedCruz I forgot the Alamo.
@SenTedCruz nobody cares
