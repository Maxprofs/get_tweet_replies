@SenTedCruz You could have stopped it if you were doing the job you are paid to do.

@paulschreiber24 @SenTedCruz As opposed to the thousand in the circle jerk where you're the pivot man.
@SenTedCruz @MrsP11307 @politico Where were you? Doing your job or taking interviews for another?
@clydescope1973 @SenTedCruz @politico Present and Voted!
@SenTedCruz @politico WHY???? We are screwed by Paul Ryan
@SenTedCruz @politico it's time to distance ourselves from the Republican Party
@SenTedCruz @GeneLingerfelt That's why in 2016 I'm voting Cruz, or Trump and whoever's running against @Rep_stevewomack
@SenTedCruz @2kschumacher @politico We know, Sir, and we are unforgivably angry!!! The GOP stinks!!!!
@SenTedCruz @JAmy208 @politico  We will vote them out
@SenTedCruz @Catalinapby1 @politico  So, what was the point in giving Republicans control of the House and Senate?
@JSmithLC @Catalinapby1 @SenTedCruz @politico ahh so I'm not the only one sitting here think that 
@SenTedCruz So, as a candidate world leader and Senator, you'll find a way to block the recess, prevent this rushed vote? Convince others?
@BartonFairfax @SenTedCruz Ted Cruz is hated even by Republican senators.
@Anumbr1 @BartonFairfax @SenTedCruz 
You just made the exact reason we love him the Democrat AND Republican hacks all hate him = CRUZ 2016
@mjericho1 @Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz Really? Can't find any support for delaying recess and forcing debate on Bill? Doesn't sound like a leader.
@BartonFairfax @Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz So because I couldn't convince enough liberals Obama was going to be a horrible president...I'm to blame
@mjericho1 @BartonFairfax @SenTedCruz You are to blame for your vote for Romney. He would have been a disaster.
@Anumbr1 @BartonFairfax @SenTedCruz Romney. DISASTER doesn't come close to describing what your vote has done to this country. WPOAT.
@mjericho1 @BartonFairfax @SenTedCruz Considering what Dubya left for Obama, he has done very well.
@SenTedCruz YAY!
@SenTedCruz Obama was elected by the people too idiot. In fact by a hell of a lot more votes than you Republicans got in 2014. have respect.
@Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz Obama was elected because he's black, worthless as president or human. worst president in the history of presidents
@39mto39g @SenTedCruz Elected because he's black? Obama was elected in spite of his race. He's a better man than McCain or Mitt. is reason.
@Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz Dave, you keep dreaming, Obama is the worst president in the history of presidents. He was/is unqualified to be Pres.
@39mto39g @SenTedCruz U must have forgotten the rotten reign of Dubya Bush! Clinton left a prosperous nation enjoying peace. Not like 2009!
@SenTedCruz Because YOU refuse to reach sensible compromises, surrender is imminent. Republicans impending demise = the Know-Nothing Party.
@SenTedCruz @Shooters_Wife And who pushed it on us? The running made of the last establishment candidate for president. Go figureâ€¦
@SenTedCruz Really Because they WERE compromises 2 Both Parties, But Cruz PROVES that he does NOT know what compromise means, Cruz TERRIBLE
@SenTedCruz 

hate to say it,
America now sucks.
@SenTedCruz @SteveDeaceShow @SpeakerRyan  Paul Ryan is a fraud who eats corn the long way.
You mean when U shut Gov down? G @SenTedCruz
Please Proceed, Senator
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz NEVER vote for any incumbent!
@SenTedCruz @Colette20583977 @politico no there were a few wins
@SenTedCruz Thnx for voting against this bill. I wish we had more Repubs we could depend on to do what they promise.
@SenTedCruz Thank you Sir for NOT voting yes on this outrageous Omnibus Bill. Meanwhile Rubio again a NO SHOW
@SenTedCruz @politico Including #NoShowRubio
@SenTedCruz @politico I told you years ago that you were wasting your time. In the end, Congress has to govern.
@SenTedCruz How can we stop this? Can we recall every one of these traitors?
@SenTedCruz @politico excellent 
@SenTedCruz hahaha...guess the Tea Party's influence is coming to an end...YAY.
@SenTedCruz Your colleagues will be fat and happy while my son will need to work until he's 80 before retiring
@SenTedCruz If you can defeat this horrible bill in the Senate you may be Presidential material. Otherwise...? It's final exam time. Begin.
@SenTedCruz A CONVENTION OF STATES IS NEEDED AND IT CAN'T BE OVERSTATED. GOP's PLAYING POLITICS AT THIS TIME IS RIDICULOUS. IMPEACH OBAMA!
@SenTedCruz Please !! Someone expose Barach Insane Nobama's plan to have NO 2016 election !!!
@SenTedCruz MR.. CRUZ AMERICANS NEED YOU AND TRUMP AS PRESIDENT& VICE PRESIDENT OR VICE VERSA. WE NEED TO IMPEACH OBAMA. WHY HAS IT NOT DONE
@SenTedCruz You are so right! I DEMAND A CONVENTION OF STATES IMMEDIATELY! OBAMA & GOP'S HAS AMERICANS IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION. NEED YOU&TR
@SenTedCruz @politico you are so right! That's why we have to get all these RINOs out!
@SenTedCruz Talk is cheap, A day late, and 1.1 trillion short, not impressed with rhetoric, words that manipulate/deceive. Check yourself.
@SenTedCruz @JRoger777 So what? You are just as dangerous, sir. Stop threatening to shutdown the gov't. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenTedCruz Republicans may have won in 2014 bit they turned Democratic the day they hit DC and took their Oath. Otherwise Obama be gone.
@realDonaldTrump @SenTedCruz @politico Trump&Cruz would be unstoppable in 2016, they would be our Phoenix rising from the ashes.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @politico this is why the people are tired of the establishment- all talk full of promises and no action !
@SenTedCruz Baffling to me why Congressional GOPers commit career suicide in voting for a bill that has everything but Americans in mind.
@SenTedCruz This bill sucks for everybody - repubs, dems, and most of all, the citizens / taxpayers of this country.
@SenTedCruz @politico #Trump2016  We can not Trust our future 2 a corrupted Congress. They have made a place in the snake pit 4 themselves.
@SenTedCruz @politico @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016  for me I think Trump/Cruise is a ticket made to bring America home. no more corruption
@SenTedCruz @politico @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016    Correction Trump/Cruz ticket, sorry For miss spelling your name Senator
@SenTedCruz @politico this needs to be stopped
@SenTedCruz Good for @POTUS.  
POTUS:  That thing you will never be.
Oh and congrats on being the only Canadian I've ever despised.
@SenTedCruz @politico @realDonaldTrump Looks like from this we are no longer America, maybe Trump will be too late, God I hope not im4 trump
@SenTedCruz @politico yes shut down the government is always the best answer #sarcasm
@SenTedCruz Once again, @TedCruz decries passage of bill where he doesn't get 100% of everything HE wants & everyone else gets 0%. #tedcruz
@SenTedCruz @politico Paul Ryan is a TRAITOR! He lied to all of us. He MUST be removed as soon as possible!!!
@SenTedCruz @politico   I would rather elect someone willing to fight and die for this country, regardless of birth, than surrender our US
@SenTedCruz @politico National Sovereignty to a treacherous traitor that was supposedly born here! US in survival mode! Do or die time!
@SenTedCruz @politico   Who is best to Honor and Protect Constitution, Bill of Rights and US way of life? @GOP @SaharahShae @AllenWest
@SenTedCruz @politico @GOP @SaharahShae @AllenWest  @TheDemocrats already suspended the birthright truth for their candidate! Repubs turn!
@SenTedCruz @politico @GOP @SaharahShae @AllenWest @TheDemocrats   At least Cruz will swear on Bible during Inauguration! Not Koran!
@SenTedCruz @politico I am sick to my stomach!  We put all of you in office to support and represent us and our conservative views!!!
@hsjr33 @SenTedCruz @politico Do you live in Wisconsin? You know how this Senator and House election thing works right?
@jaxdan43 @SenTedCruz @politico I do not live in Wisconsin and hope his constituents are as upset as I am!!!
@hsjr33 @SenTedCruz @politico Some may very well be....I'd assume others not so much.
@SenTedCruz you could always shut down the govt again...
@SenTedCruz Mr Cruz do you think it is time for you to tell Americans why our own party is surrendering to Obama?
@SenTedCruz @politico paul Ryan is a sellout like boehner was
@SenTedCruz Figures
@SenTedCruz @politico looks like your party is weak. Better wake up
@SenTedCruz You say that like it's a bad thing
@SenTedCruz why am I a Republican again?  So McConnell and Ryan can lie to me.  #CruzRepresentsMeWell #DefundTheGOP
@SenTedCruz GOP CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP: "COWARDLY, COOPERATIVE COLLABORATION"...A 'BEARD" FOR THE LIBERALS!
@curtiswright @SenTedCruz  #Trump2016 @realDonaldTrump  Ryan your new horns & tail will take you down #foxandfriends
@SenTedCruz shut it down again, slapnutz.
@SenTedCruz @politico That's for sure.
@SenTedCruz @politico once again we find the republicans we elected to stop Obama's plans for ruin have broken their campaign promises.
@SenTedCruz I literally have the opposite opinion on this one.
@SenTedCruz Show some balls & stop him.
@SenTedCruz Republicans should give Obama Nothing. fund the necessary and not what he wants.
@SenTedCruz @politico there will another landslide election come 2016. But it won't be for your party.
@reaDonaldTrump @SenTedCruz @politico oh good grief, not again??? Just stop!!!
@SenTedCruz Obama needs brain transplant urgently, he needs help.
@SenTedCruz @politico by republican victories you mean #doll #air #express #priorities
@SenTedCruz @proteinwisdom @politico This is the establishment thumbing their noses at American electorate. #GOPe saying "you're FIRED!"
@SenTedCruz @politico .....#Loser
@SenTedCruz isn't that the President does? Prioritise spending? Speak up about CISA & you'll gain more traction.
@SmilingKnight93 @SenTedCruz no, the House prioritizes spending.  Well, they're supposed to...
@SenTedCruz WAY TO FOLD LIKE A LAWNCHAIR ONCE AGAIN!!! HILLARY'S LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE WH
@SenTedCruz ONCE AGAIN U WOULD THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE THE MAJORITY AND THEY PROBABLY WILL BE THE WAY U GUYS ARE FOLDING !!!
@SenTedCruz it's never going to change in congress There are not enough principled men
@SenTedCruz Very sad. We are disconnected from those we elected. They do not represent our needs and they do not honor their oaths to us.
@SenTedCruz #onetermsenator
@SenTedCruz Betrayal at it's BEST!   Establishment GOP is FINISHED.
@SenTedCruz @politico Rubio said:  If THEY want the bill passed, THEY will ram it down our throats."  This is the problem!
@SenTedCruz And everyone wonders why We The People are so pissed off. Head-spinning idiocy.
