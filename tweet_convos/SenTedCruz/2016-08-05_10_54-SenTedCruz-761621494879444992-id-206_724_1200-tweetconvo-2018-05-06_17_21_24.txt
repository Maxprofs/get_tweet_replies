. @SenTedCruz Dems also sent letter
Idea: Stop writing
Reconvene
Talk
Pass a CLEAN bill
No Confed flag, PP/ACA cuts
Congratulations @SenTedCruz for impressing no body.
You seriously get government expenditures information from "many news outlets"? Don't you people know where your own money goes?
Give it a rest @SenTedCruz your boy @realDonaldTrump is coming to save the  Right?! LOL!! What a Joke! #notmyprez  #Zika
I agree we must keep an eye on our officials! Come on is this really all you got?! I'm sure he's waiting research for $!!
@RonSimmonsTexas @POTUS 1.5-2Million Americans disabled by #ME/#CFS. #NIH allocates <$10M for research! Provide $$ in Research!
Sick one dude. Is that all you've done in the past ten years
how do you insult someone while asking them for millions of dollars.
@TexasGOP blames @NRSC @GOP controlled Congress @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @SpeakerRyan for obstructing @POTUS on #Zika
http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/ted-cruz-didnt-bother-to-vote-on-a-bill-to-fight-the-zika-virus-as-texas-scrambles-to-prevent-an-outbreak/ …
Maybe Congress shouldn't have taken a 7 week break and tried to add in contraceptive limitations in the bill.
Expose this quisling!! Thank you Ted!
@zozopotamus #Obama doesn't care about us! He wants Zika money to send to Iran!
I'd like you and @marcorubio to team up against Zika.
Why didn't you do your job and vote for funding Ted Cruz. You went on vacation instead.
put a clean bill forward and stop playing with people's lives
You need to look no further than the GOP, you nitwit. Now that it's a crisis, you're paying attention? #pathetic
Ted Cruz didn’t bother to vote on a bill to fight the Zika virus as Texas scrambles to prevent an outbreak
But no action on gun regs needed because Zika is a much greater public health threat right Ted? #asshole #TedCruz #GOP
You turn down funding last winter when research should of started then. Resign!
hey moron pass a clean bill for Zika and only Zika !!The amend with welfare money bullshit needs to stop!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
Wow that's gonna really scare him.
Congress must approve funding, you nitwit. Get back to work.
why continue to deny adequate funding for Zika research and treatment #Texas? @POTUS requested more funds. Get serious.
Funding is the job of the Congress. Not surprised you don't know that, since you've avoided doing that job for months
He won't tell you the truth.
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-administration-warns-congress-funding-to-fight-zika-is-running-out/ …
maybe he should "vote his conscience"
Face it Ted....your politics career is dead
Zika is a complete sham.
@thematrixqueen @POTUS go get them Ted but me as a Texan I do believe in protecting my family! But also I was raised to be a
to be the better man! Go ahead a show the people of Texas you are and indorse Trump! Don't be the low man
I'm not surprised that this isn't bipartisan. I guess even a #Texas #Liberal is still a #Liberal. Thank you for this @SenTedCruz
@kaleyokelley You're no Senator of mine.
@RuthRogul @POTUS @realDonaldTrump thanks you!
thank you Sen. Cornyn and all delegation that signed with interest.
tell them to send it to your buddies in the @HouseGOP who did nothing before they went on vacation!
The honorable barack obama?    There is no such thing !
Anti-Zika Funding is just another political tool for Obama. He will stall on it & blame Republicans.
Our @POTUS ask for funding 2 deal w/Zika in Feb2016
@SenTedCruz & the rest of the freeloaders in Congress blew it OFF
#BlueWave2016 FnRepubs
...Hmm, I am guessing the funds are held up in Congress, surprise! Not the  prezident's office.
@yaboymihir where are our signatures?
Woah, woah, the administration asked for 1.9 billion in funding and republicans voted it down.
Where's the Fucking Letter for our Veterans still dying wating to see a doctor or be admitted TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz ? What a MORON!
it's the house of Representatives in Congress that's done nothing. As usual you are #lyinTed
I think you are a great man please help us don't leave us to Hillary Clinton
@DeepSouthProud @POTUS Ted Poe has some hieroglyphics going on with that sig.
Well, this is a new low for our TX congressional members. You botched this up with funding cuts and attacks on PP. #Shame
are you talking about the one that the rep cut? I hope they didn't have to come  back from vacation
@benshapiro @POTUS leave the man alone. He's playing golf and planning his last "paid for by us" vacation to Hawaii
.@SenTedCruz @POTUS #Bloomberg @newkirkmargaret warned @MayorGimenez "Only 12 Inspectors Stand Btw #Zika & #Miami" http://bloom.bg/1UtGgAs 
WTF? Send this letter to the GOP obstructionist Congress. Pass additional @CDCgov funding. What a joke you are.
keep the pressure on Ted..we are counting on you and the whole TX delegation to show them how things get DONE!
Ted you know very well it's Congress that should act and here you are just lying to us. Stop misinformation for political mileag
THANKS FOR TRYING SENATOR CRUZ

Are you a noobie?  Congress needs to act and pass a bill.
@draftcn4pres @POTUS
dems lie lie and lie some more:

move to Canada knucklehead!
DDT will fix this problem inside of two weeks.
Get your sorry ass back to D.C. and get to work passing legislation that doesn't include partisan bs earmarked to it.
yeah, but, it's Texas. you have a guy in office who claims wind farms will slow the wind down and cause fires. seriously?
you could start with endorsing Trump! 
u need to do something about the ransom obama paid & lied about along w/ lying Hillary w/ her emails & bengazzi.
@realdcm @POTUS Thank you, Senator Cruz!!  if #crookedhillary wins, we must #TEXIT 
He spent the money on ransoming American Hostages.
haven't you heard Senator? This all yall's fault
go home Cruz
get on board the trump train cruz
Another bait and switch redistribution scheme.
great. Now get answers on the 400 mil extortion payment.
that's funny coming from the guys who wouldn't work with Obama when he asked 4zika funding &then went in vacation
Why will they fix it.  A woman who gets it while she's pregnant will be running to planned parenthood in sevonds. Ching
you had better get on board with Donald or you can kiss our country and religious freedoms goodbye!From a conservative Christian
Obama just lies, crying this morning for funding always trashing others
maybe congressional idiots can get off their a$$ and fund it!
Senator Cruz, since watching you on #uncommon knowledge in March 2013, I knew you could be our next POTUS - if you want to be!!
after paying the $400 million ransom there is only 200 left which is being paid to the #BLM terrorists.
@benshapiro @POTUS what is up with Ted Poe's signature
so there is a known amt of $400 million set aside for Zika unused? Hmmmm. I think that fraud in chief found a path 4 it
tell your fellow republicans to pass it!!!! Stop trying to derail and accuse the POTUS!!!!
how about funding for jobs Ted? Or food? Or cancer? Or women's health?
You passed legislation of some kind or are you trying to taunt @POTUS into an executive action?
did the entire delegation agree to get rid of ridiculous riders?
Why do you care liar

Try submitting a clean bill with no @GOP frills in it. You think he's really "pro-Zika?" Don't be so sneaky.
Nothing about Congress’ refusal to fund before their lengthy vacation?
Phony fear mongering.
thank you for yours efforts to questionon behalf of the American folks.
we would like to know where this virus comes from strange how it all of a sudden just appeared!
#Republicans tried holding @POTUS back for 7 plus yrs. 255k job creation for July, 292k last month... Wow POTUS on fire.
@JoLissa13 @POTUS thank you for fighting for the people, like you do every single day for us.    God Bless you.
@benshapiro @POTUS still hoping for #Texit
Way 2 go @SenTedCruz ! Keep this lameduck @POTUS checked until January, then let's have him arrested 4 treason cuz every1 knows he's guilty
he's probably using the funds to support the Hillary Campaign.
I'm sure he will give you honest answers.
Obama's hypocritical. - he says the poor BABIES are the ones being affected by Zika. Yet abortion is okay?
@benshapiro @POTUS that $600 million went to Iran.
the games you people in Congress play.
still trying to figure out how a country 19 trillion in debt can afford 600 million to kill mosquitoes
Oh, a letter. That's a good one! Like @POTUS reads them.
Uh, the president of on vacation unlike this Republican led congress.
you really are shameless Ted
Why didn't congress act on it? Oh that's right, they're on a summer vacation. 
#Useless
I'm sure he files where the rest are he received... In the Trash
Ted, we all know your signature means nothing.
Teddy tell your republican friends they need to pass the bill with no string attached. It's not @POTUS. #Simple
Wow, congress working during your 8 week vacation. Now that's a sacrifice.
Think of all the time you wasted whining about something instead of leading #DoYourJob
Here's a CRAAAAZY idea Ted: Have your colleagues in #Congress offer a clean bill on #Zika spending, no strings attached! #GOP
I thought you wanted to reduce the role and funding of the Federal Goverment?
hell Don't they already have this info? Did they come back 2 vote .The GOP especially Cruz is trying to play I'm working
Who are the members of congress that are filibustering and stopping legislation? And these are good questions!
They went to Iran Ted. No matter, unvetted refugees & illegals bring w/ them more diseases thought eradicated years ago
He only cares about BLM, not ALM. Hell, he was letting in people coming from Ebola stricken countries like it was his job
try to get funds from obstructionist irresponsible @HouseGOP You all barking at the wrong tree dog. Talk to @SpeakerRyan.
where's the bill without any other GOP attachments to it? Fraud. You're letting this disease spread because of politics.
Ted you are smartest guy in the @GOP you didn't support #TrumpTheIdiot
GOOD!!!
ANTİ LAİK DEMOKRAT KÖKTEN DİNCİ VE ŞERİATÇI DİNİ LİDERLERİ YARATTIKLARI CEHENNEMLERİNE GÖNDERİN.
Why did Obama refuse 2 ban travel to zika-infected countries? He wants it here, so he can get money & skim $ for himself!
@agecmorgan @POTUS Is it a good idea to post people's signatures? Cut and pasters could have a field day.
If you get a reply back, it will probably lacking in veracity.
Wow. Out and out goal post moving. CONGRESS is the party responsible that left town. Idiot.
You realize Zika can be prevented by wearing mosquito spray right? $7 a bottle
You'll look in to thus but not stealing $250 billion from GSE's in illegal profit sweep?? An example of why you lost Ted.
If their brains are as clear as their handwriting  we are all
   in trouble  nursery school  Education at work in the GOP
How about a clean bill to fund this? You know, one that doesn't defund Planned Parenthood?
disregard my other comment. Good job!!!
@benshapiro @POTUS um..thx?
and what has congress done on zika?
Demand impeachment of Obama for ransoming Americans.
and once again Ted, nothing will come of it
how about helping to stop Hillary and not put down our nominee
@ABCPolitics @CBSNews @NBCPolitics @CNNPolitics @MSNBC
Today the entire #Texas GOP delegation sent a letter to @POTUS demanding answers on Anti-Zika Funding 
.@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama Raided $500M for Zika to Finance UN’s Green Climate Fund http://dailysign.al/1WcE5EQ  via @SenatorLankford @DailySignal
since your defection at the RNC, I have to ignore your opinions, and that of anyone who shares your work.
Why?
how about contempt of congress charges for lying Hillary.
how about impeachment papers on Obama
Didn't the GOP block it because the Dems added a bunch of pork to the bill?
Yes :) ☆ Thank you Senator for what you do :) Keep fighting the good Fight!!!
U act like it was so hard to send a letter?Big whoop, this man took $400million of our tax $ and gave to terrorist,Do something!
it wasn't US's tax money, it was the Iranians, that the US seized and held onto for decades read/watch the news
Oh u mean our propaganda media? The one our prez pays to have story's printed? U need to do ur research, open ur eyes!
not my media, don't live in the US my media is not allowed by law to carry political bias. You however seem blind
US Isover 19trill in dept, we don't have $400mil laying around in some bankaccount from the70s  http://freebeacon.com/national-security/iran-400-million-cash-part-expensive-price-free-u-s-hostages/ …
sounds like a local and state problem to me.
Shamefl tht GOPHouse&Sen playing RRoulette w/ health of Americans; DROP the partisan issues(PlnndPrnthd&EnvRegs)from bill
maybe he will send you cash in an unmarked plane
@benshapiro @POTUS I'm so proud of you for obstructing Obama 4 years and asking why nothing could get done
What about the Money Laundered Ransom Money?  Lame Congress again.  Letting lawless Obama do whatever he wants.
the money was side line to pay Ransom to Iraq just saying
Go back to Canada Judas, have more respect in u if u joined Democrats.
why do you even write him letters when you know he will wipe his ass with it? Why don't you fight for once #tcot
Here's some money...
Obama Paid for Terrorism With $400 Million in Untraceable Cash http://ow.ly/dkXb302Y7jl  
He had 500 Million for Zika..where did that go????
ASK YOUR FUCKING PARTY YOU PUT UP A POISON BILL AND IT DID NOT PASS ITS THE GOP'S FAULT  #GOPDEATHPANELS
why didn't you demand answers on the #IranRansomScandal
@benshapiro @POTUS Maybe if you'd send a bill that didn't include PP it'd pass
@benshapiro @POTUS 

"Demanding answers" eh?  
People have been telling me that @SenTedCruz is the Zodiac Killer I'm sure there's no way but I hear things from smart people and wonder
Dear Ted: We sent the money to Iran.  Love, Barack
No mention of PPP defunding and all the poison pills I suppose. Dishonest GOP. Liars like your Candidate for President
Go Geg'em Ted! CRUZ 20'
It's because it's packed full of religious bullshit.
he sent it to iran.
Funny!Sad but Funny 
I would rather grow a 3rd testicle from DDT over exposure than for any children to be affected by Zika.
