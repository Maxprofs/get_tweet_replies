To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
You've been Grubered

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Single payer is awful!  Go live in the UK and see firsthand how it works.. or doesn't work #FullRepeal  Get Govt out of healthcare!
If only you had evidence for your claims #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
Ted I keep telling you I'm 5 min walk to your house. Tell me to my face you are ok with killing me.
Until Democrats take a stand against aborting a million babies a year, they can just shut up about the Republicans "killing people."
So until then you are ok with bringing back lifetime max and killing cancer patients? Do you even know how much each treatment is?
As a matter of fact I do.
You didn't answer the first question.
@BetoORourke for Senate 2018!
Who????
But who can afford the $12,000 deductible
More lies.  #LoseCruz2018 473 days

premiums will be lowered with junk insurance. You know, the kind you CANNOT be sold under ACA. The kind that covers nothing! #loseCruz2018
Who can afford Obamacare?  Ridiculously high premiums and even higher deductibles
Your own party doesn't even like you and after Trump you are the most despised politician in Washington. Resist!
You can Resist all you want but Hillary or Bernie will never be POTUS
Very flawed report. Hell your freedom amendment is so bad even the insurance companies hate it. Don't kill us Cruz
No he is NOT! You can have a voice! But so do I! Obama could have been a good Pres! Instead he was tearing us apart! PTL for Trump & Cruz!
Practice building consensus. If you can do this and only if you could be next president. Otherwise forget about it.
But... Repeal first!  @SpeakerRyan @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @h4congress
Most Americans have no trust in Dr. Price at HHS. He is not truthful or sincere or trustworthy. Anything from HHS should be questioned.
Wrong. We dont trust you.
The study assumes a 12k deductible.  How the hell is that affordable?
Right. But these rich men have no clue how hard it is for average people to make ends meet...and they don't care either
Ted are you numerically challenged? All you guys doing is whining about repealing Obamacare instead of come with a proper solution
Is there any support in the Senate for this anendment?
I'm sure your mama agrees. You will always be her little lyin Ted!
Ted, you have very funny math. Please take your hands out of your pockets and use all your fingers to count.
Guess Heidi & kids don't rank as high as "sniveling coward" @realDonaldTrump eh? No surprise where your country/constituents rate. Traitor.
t's from Trump's guy...CBO says its Fake News
Add this amendment, Ted. Any government official will receive the healthcare plan offered that is least expensive in his/her state.
Of course it does...Tom Price wrote the report so it would say that.  What does the CBO say?
Are you now in the business of spreading falsehoods just to take the black guy's name off the healthcare bill? The CBO gave us the data...
How about reducing the cost of medical care so I don't have to pay an insurance premium.  Attack the root.
The crappy analysis HHS did also say the policies will have a $12000.00 deductible
The premiums are NOT the issue!  The issue is being able to get treatment when you a sick without going bankrupt.
The premiums are the issue.. without them, you have no insurance
Who gives a rat's about "consumer freedom?" It won't mean Jack when you get hit by a truck or pole-axed by a stroke. 
You're crazy.
Problem is no one believes the HHS analysis
Thank U Senator! U R truly a Patriot! @senrobportman a disgrace changes his promise 2ppl who voted him bc @POTUS!
Wellwhat about the CBO? What is correct
gop needs to pass hcare, prove they can govern.
CBO on repeal-only   2018: 17 million more would be uninsured than ACA  2020: 27 million more  2026: 32 million more   Premiums would double
And no coverage, liar
CBO calls B S.
Quit spreading lies
enough flimflammery!  even insurance companies don't trust you and have rejected your proposal to let them sell plans that cover nothing...
That is admin propaganda:
Reduces premiums because it isn't really insurance.  Expands coverage by 2M from the 24M who will lose, that's still 22M w/o coverage. BAD!
Good job Senator! U really put America 1st - thank u! #WeThePeople_TaxPayers_LegalVoters R CRASHED by GOVT w #Taxes & #O_care! Work w @POTUS
So what it's from bias Dr. Price who is spouting so many lies and not making any sense in the math how this is going to work
Check the latest CBO pal. HHS will do anything Trump tells them to do. And you know that.  The Price is Wrong!
Did you need not just see the CBO score?
we'll rely on the CBO score, thanks. 32 mil uninsured and premiums double.
It's a step in the right direction.
Your amendment does not save money when they will have NO Coverage for the expensive illnesses!
Study (by me): my kid is the best kid in America.
Can't you put that in as a law by itself?  Without all the additional crap that goes into bills in Congress
lot of prefab tweets
My premiums will probably down 100% along with my coverage. Your amendment is garbage, much like your party. #TrumpCare #Losers
Get obamacare repealed, or no vote at elections got it
The Orange Fool said it best, Lyin Ted.
Texas deserves better than Cornyn and Cruz.
BullShit!, Ted, just BullShit!
I can sell you a health insurance policy for $100. But that doesn't mean I'm going to pay any of your medical bills!
Ted, the fact that any of you have to VOTE on HC is a HUGE SIGN IT COMES FROM GOV?
Look at the CBO score not HHS bullsh*@

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Because it's a no coverage plan.
Seems to be many more who disagree #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #SinglePayer
.@AHIPCoverage condemns Cruz amdt to #BCRA. Says proposal would lead to "unstable health insurance markets" h/t @pauldemko @POLITICOPro
Consumer Freedom? We didn't have that in the Constitution or WHAT? Is this something you wrote up. Only time to rise up is 4 Show & Tell
Oh please   President Trump is the best negotiator. He can't because it's mean. #fakehealthcare

JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Thank you for your leadership Sen. Cruz!
They should try again. #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA  #StopTrumpCare #SinglePayer #Medicaid
 Here are the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out:

Big idea 1: the Cruz amendment.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage."
