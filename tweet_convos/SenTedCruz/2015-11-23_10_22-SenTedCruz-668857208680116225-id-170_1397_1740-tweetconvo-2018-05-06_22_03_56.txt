Obama; President of the World, 'Earned' the Nobel Prize for being black, has a duty to ALL mankind. We must share his majesty.

@SenTedCruz
But his Democrats and compliant Republicans are. @TracySorrell1 @SenTedCruz @TammaraMaiden1 @Wendy61342557 @SnarkyFieds @S3nt13ntB31ng
The end result may be the same. Time to clean house. @TracySorrell1 @SenTedCruz @TammaraMaiden1 @Wendy61342557 @SnarkyFieds @S3nt13ntB31ng
When this became acceptable behavior Democrats lost all moral high ground. Not a GOP problem.



@S3nt13ntB31ng
@SenTedCruz So you support selling weapons to Iran?  Because that's what Reagan did.
@rwingtrollol @SenTedCruz U mean like Hillary did to ISIS via Libya?
@softwarnet @SenTedCruz Among the many voices in your head, which one of them told you that your comment made any sense?
@rwingtrollol @SenTedCruz The one that told me it would annoy a liberal hypocrite of something that happened this side of the century..
@softwarnet @SenTedCruz You're entertaining, not annoying.  It's amusing to see that some folks can't take a holiday from dumbness.
@rwingtrollol @SenTedCruz Since you have no defense then you must be a Hillary supporter. Hit RESET and try again.
@softwarnet @SenTedCruz You should join Addicted to Dumb GIF Files Anonymous.  The first step is admitting that you have a problem.
@rwingtrollol @SenTedCruz Starting to sound annoyed... hmmm 
What did Putin say to Hillary Clinton?
I've got mail!
@SenTedCruz Cruz, you are quoting a failed president.  Please hush.
@MarkUSA760 @SenTedCruz Only quote success like Obama.
Hahaha haha haha
@JamesClarityguy @SenTedCruz Obama has been extremely successful.  Saved the economy, saved car industry, insured millions, etc.
@MarkUSA760 @SenTedCruz ????????
@JamesClarityguy @SenTedCruz Rafael Cruz is anti science and has only accomplished a taxpayer funded govt shutdown.
@MarkUSA760 @SenTedCruz Anti Science?
@JamesClarityguy @SenTedCruz Very much so, doesn't believe in climate change.
@MarkUSA760 @SenTedCruz Why should anyone? The jury's still out.... oh wait does that make me ANTI science too bec I have a diff opinion?!
@SenTedCruz. Have Clinton or Obama said anything that's worth quoting? Other than "depends what the meaning of is is."
@SenTedCruz @wtfnewsamerica We WON the last Congressional elections in both chambers, but you can't tell it by the crap the GOP is doing
@wtfnewsamerica @SenTedCruz BS. The GOP has bent over & grabbed their ankles now in both House & Senate. "Rules" didn't stopped the DEMS
@SenTedCruz @jstines3 The GOP never liked Reagan  he made us good again
@SenTedCruz @jstines3 I've been right wing conserv all my life but the right is pulling my strings. I'm not a puppet
@SenTedCruz @jstines3 only a priority if you believe in America and don't want to fundamentally change it. Heal our country please.
@SenTedCruz @SheriffClarke Something Obama and his admin doesn't believe in, rather protect rights of potential terrorists invading USA
@SenTedCruz @Freedomoffreedo not now
@SenTedCruz absolutely!
@SenTedCruz @SheriffClarke
@SenTedCruz @TeaPartyNevada So, did Ted's Mom file the American citizen born abroad document with the American Embassy in Canada? Whereisit?
@SenTedCruz @TeaPartyNevada jCruz ur no Reagan no where close to him he never attack his own party like u did and ly about them
@SenTedCruz @TeaPartyNevada You couldn't look more presidential than Ronald Reagan. If he were alive today, he'd vote for you. No doubt.
@SenTedCruz  And yet tens of thousands of American citizens are killed each year while you refuse to consider gun legislation.
@SenTedCruz @wtfnewsamerica This is the attitude of a true leader! Obama on the other hand is a PUSSY!
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 ...means NOTHING to a generation in which EVERYONE gets a trophy!
@SenTedCruz truth, We The People come first. Thank You Ted Cruz #CruzCrew #Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz @SheriffClarke @BarackObama take notes

@SenTedCruz @jjauthor 
Das wichtigste für Merkel, das Amerikanische Volk (Industrie) und sich selbst zu schützen?
@SenTedCruz @jjauthor Don't compare yourself to Reagan he didn't have to lie for a year to set up a coup
@SenTedCruz @SheriffClarke bomb them till they cry 'uncle' and surrender!
@SenTedCruz Yes sir!
@SenTedCruz @TeaPartyNevada Zero sum gamesmanship in a representative democracy is a disaster. Cruz, you are an ignoramus.
@SenTedCruz @TeaPartyNevada someone should remind our current Pres he was elected to protect us. Not turn his back on us.
@SenTedCruz Did you forget Reagan was against assault weapons?
@SenTedCruz Bush and Cheneyhad armed ISIS
@peruanitofeliz are you a complete ignorant fool? ISIS/ISIL wasn't even thought of when Bush was President. ISIS was started on Obamas watch
@deojr1965 do your homework and do a research.
@peruanitofeliz that coming from a person who said ISIS was around when Bush was President. Now that's hilarious.
@deojr1965 I did not say that. Here, I made it easy for you. http://www.salon.com/2015/04/09/listen_its_still_their_fking_fault_bush_cheney_neo_con_drivel_and_the_truth_about_iraq_and_isis/ … Read it and think about it.
@peruanitofeliz @peruanitofeliz: @SenTedCruz Bush and Cheneyhad armed ISIS. Your comment!
@SenTedCruz @SheriffClarke Yes indeed!
@SenTedCruz W/ nomination won, cool considers Dan Quale 4running mate. Mature, he looked good by Fox interviews about Destiny &Power.
@SenTedCruz As long as we continue to allow citizens to arm themselves and protect their families
@SenTedCruz Right on
@SenTedCruz Why does anybody have to lose? It's not a game. It's about working together for what's best for everyone.
@SenTedCruz Then why dont you and the Far Right protect us?
@SenTedCruz Can you get any dumber? Really, is that even possible?
@SenTedCruz @LadyB117 @SpeakerRyan
@waeljbara @SenTedCruz winner is America winner.  :)
@SenTedCruz and we lost so much when Reagan took office , untrustworthy, crooked , greedy , are best words to describe Reagan .
@SenTedCruz @FreedomChild3 Man he was down right a person first
@Rparisee @RhonUSA @SenTedCruz @FreedomChild3 How is Ted Cruz for the American people. With H1B workers 500 x more. Bs Bought politician.
@SenTedCruz We lose if (God forbid) YOU become President. We're DOOMED.
@SenTedCruz SINCE WHEN DID THE #AMERICA FEEL SAFE WHEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ALLOWED US TO BE ATTACKED ON 9/11? #Reagan sold guns to #Iran
@SenTedCruz When it comes to right wing CHRISTIAN terrorists, looks like you dropped the ball.
Senator, you are no Ronald Regan. HE was a natural born citizen and an honorable man! @SenTedCruz @CeceCalabrese
@SenTedCruz and if you win, America loses.
.@SenTedCruz 

What about fraud, waste and abuse in the Military Industrial Complex?
@SenTedCruz .@rmuse 

Halliburton breaks US record for foreign bribes:
@SenTedCruz
We need an electable candidate whose integrity and decisiveness will destroy #HillaryClinton's life of deceit in the general election. #Cruz
@SenTedCruz Are you willing to protect women seeking reproductive healthcare?
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz is all mouth and a hypocrite. He can criticize the President but is insulted if he criticizes him. COWARD
@SenTedCruz The American people lose when a Greedy Obstructionist Pirate is elected. They are ALL self serving
@SenTedCruz So what are you doing about protecting Americans from domestic terrorists like we just saw in CO? I think u fanned those flames.
@SenTedCruz How many years did you sit in the worst Senate in history while your colleagues and President destroyed thus country?
@SenTedCruz Equally important is to protect the ideas of freedom and democracy.
@SenTedCruz And a government that invests its time and money in the welfare of its citizens is a strong government
@SenTedCruz and Reagan ran this country into the ground just like every other republican. Trickle down economics don't work.
@SenTedCruz And Humanity loses with you!HOW dare you as a Christian say we will only saveChristians in this nightmare of a refugee situation
@SenTedCruz Here's another GREAT ONE!  #Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63   And only the American people. Charity begins at home.
@SenTedCruz Who is "they"? "They" is the cornerstone of fascism.
@SenTedCruz Ted, shame on your racist statements against American Muslims & Islam.Your neo-con Zionist Christians created ISIS in Iraq.FACT!

@SenTedCruz cannot wait to use the words of President Obama when Ted Cruz becomes president. Shut up we won!
@SenTedCruz America is worth fighting for!
He totally nailed it w #FOPA86. He and his won. Me and mine lost. 

@SenTedCruz @Quinnrob76
@Minutemaniac @SenTedCruz before my time. What did the bill do?
Banned all newly manufactured select-fire (full-auto capable) arms from "civilians." Made a $400 Glock 18 cost $15K. @Quinnrob76 @SenTedCruz
And a host of other BS unproven and demonstrably ineffective #gunsense still in effect today... @Quinnrob76 @SenTedCruz
...all under the propaganda-dripping name of "Firearm Owners Protection Act." Sickening stuff. Created NICS. 

@Quinnrob76 @SenTedCruz
Only good it did was ban registration, which is selectively enforced (while the rest seems unassailable). 

Bah. 

@Quinnrob76 @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Google #Muslims on White House staff and be astounded. Good ammo for you.

@SenTedCruz @POTUS @VP What's the plan to teach them our laws and have them abide by them? @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz @TellyStern abd her longtime friends &allies
Israel & little ol Australia Britain all the rest take a number
@AmeriAmerican @SenTedCruz Guess you need losers in order to have blowback to protect yourself from. Equality's not good for war business...
@AmeriAmerican @SenTedCruz And that sounds like a warhawk's excuse for tyranny and unsustainable short-term profit.
@SenTedCruz How many terrorists where stopped by the govt on 9/11? How many were stopped by THE PEOPLE on flt 93? @POTUS You need THE PEOPLE
@SenTedCruz 100% correct. So tired of feeling that wanting to keep our borders & citizens safe is uncaring & wrong! That's insanity!
@SenTedCruz this quote came from a President whom funded Iran (the same country you opposed to signing the nuclear treaty).
@SenTedCruz @ellejaii Hey, isn't that what fathers of homes and countries are suppose to say?
@SenTedCruz @Bwdreyer 

And I was thinking this was an Obama quote... oops
@SenTedCruz Reagan knew climate change was real.
@SenTedCruz #Truth!! #tcot #ccot

@SenTedCruz That is correct, but with a legal candidate like Trump."natural born" doesn't mean Cuban.It means American natural born.U R'nt.
@SenTedCruz - This is an ethical dumpster of an international policy. Are we winning? #childPoverty #massIncarceration #healthCare #IDHR
@SenTedCruz @PatriotCzar First duty for WeThePpl/fathers&mothers is to Fearless Protect our families/Homes/communities! Not to live in Fear!
@SenTedCruz .. I'm sure he was thinking about #Americans ... #Asswipe
@SenTedCruz Go away.
@SenTedCruz #immigration please read http://fb.me/3w1ui9z8d  Son of US born ctzn with USCit grandparents first the Legal still wait from 8y
@SenTedCruz No sir #TedCruz  the government's first duty is to follow the Constitution, Bill of Rights, & Amendments. Which y'all won't do.
@SenTedCruz You are wrong in your recollection of Reagan. He raised taxes, signed pro-abortion laws, amnesty, kept God out of govt. U suck.
@SenTedCruz Sen Cruz I only wish that the feeling of POTUS!
@SenTedCruz Obama first duty is to weaken American!
@SenTedCruz @BradThor Not just running against HRC or BO, but against the left who wants to destroy civilization. We win, they lose.
@SenTedCruz not according to Obama "we win" is just a slogan and all that just think a commander and chief who thinks its wrong to win
@SenTedCruz if we only had a real American president!
@SenTedCruz Are you a Christian?
@peruanitofeliz @SenTedCruz You must not be listening & watching or you would know that he is  Are you a Christian? I pray for you & America
@jck53 I was being sarcastic. A lot of GOP people say they are but they don't follow the values and principles of a Christian.
@SenTedCruz Did he say that before or after he abandoned our Marines when they were bombed in Beirut? #selectivememory #Demagogue #cutandrun
@SenTedCruz unfortunately Obama has it backwards his motto is they win we lose
@SenTedCruz we need to build a wall now and not wait for a disaster before we take action
@SenTedCruz 17 years in public service and all of the sudden you think America needs a wall Hmmm i wonder why?
@BentleyforTrump @SenTedCruz We've needed a wall 4 a long time but now more than ever since O opened the flood gates to include terrorists
@SenTedCruz WAKE UP AMERICA

@SenTedCruz How 7 years of Obama brought the world from Kumbaya to chaos http://nyp.st/1JKHi2s  via @nypost
.@SenTedCruz You really should stop quoting President Reagan (for many reasons). Here's just two of them.
@Snarkaroni @SenTedCruz what's your point? Reagan was lied to by you progressives. Had he known it his amnesty would never have happened!
“@SenTedCruz: Reagan put it best - We win. They Lose. 1st duty of our government is to protect the American people. http://bit.ly/1X9E5GE ”
@SenTedCruz That's right Senator. About safe How about 241 Marines killed in 1983 under Reagan's when SecDef told him not put in troops.
@SenTedCruz Thanks for your daily does of fascist propaganda.
@SenTedCruz Hear HERE!
@SenTedCruz Well then quit fighting for what the stupid Tea Party folks want and vote for the good of America. & Reagan made LOTS of errors.
@SudokuG Obama has made more errors than a blind shortstop.
@IndianaRight Only in the minds of RWNJs, which apparently you are one.
@SudokuG Only in the minds of sane Americans. Obama is an embarrassment.
@IndianaRight You liking Cruz puts you in no position to think they're sane.
@SudokuG You voting for Obama makes you part of a large problem. Seven years of hell.
@IndianaRight ONLY for you right wing nut jobs...he's done a great job especially w/all the obstruction & hate; UR on wrong side of history.
@SudokuG LOL. You are delusional. Obama has divided this Country like no other. Total failure.
@SenTedCruz You just care more about Americans than you do illegal aliens or Syrian refugees.  What's wrong with you?
@SenTedCruz DOUCHE! Reagan sold weapons to IRAN! His Contra's FAILED! His assisting Israels Invasion of Lebanon, gave us 9.11 Al Qaeda!
@SenTedCruz Muslim Obama never got that memo.
@SenTedCruz What did "We" win again Rafael?
@SenTedCruz    Selling missiles to Iran by firing air controllers and raising taxes but proved a mentally disabled person could be Pres
@SenTedCruz SHOULD THE EU CREATING A EUROPEAN BASE OF INTELLIGENCE INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM

@SenTedCruz OK tough guy, who lost?
@SenTedCruz Fight the good fight. Keep the faith. Finish the course. It is always too soon to quit.
2nd duty is to think ahead & to limit unintended consequences of our actions which will come back to haunt us. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz sigh, a leader we enjoy quoting
@SenTedCruz    If Ted Cruz becomes our next  PRESIDENT , all America will be the loser !!!
@SenTedCruz did reagan say that before or after leaving lebanon after the barracks bombing? i wanna get the time line straight.
@SenTedCruz Keep pushing Ted.  You can win this!
@SenTedCruz that is why he retreated from Lebanon letting them win
