Isn't that going to put a lot of ppl out of work? Guess he isn't concerned about unemployment rate.
They can find other jobs. I'm tired of a third of my pay going to subsidize leeches!
When they can't pay their bills it will eventually be your problem.
Wrong. Someone else's inability to pay their bills is not my problem.
Not if they end up on public assistance. Your fellow citizens are no concern of yours.
So all Americans should have to keep paying outrageous taxes so a bunch of IRS can keep govt jobs?
It doesn't matter. The IRS isn't going anywhere. They've been singing this tune for decades.
Yeah, and Hillary Clinton is the president. You demoncrats always know everything.
@Obsessedabroad @tedcruz @POTUS Abolish the IRS!!! Fair tax is the answer!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Absolutely abolish IRS
Hey that's what was in Trump's plan too on his website very early on...postcard! Let's do it!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Big money savings to rid country of corrupt IRS.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS I can think of one advantage: if it's on a postcard we could see 45's taxes.
Abolishing the IRS and Federal Reserve would go far towards freeing up our country
you are correct.  The origin of the federal reserve and the way it operates is a bit shady.
who would enforce our nation tax laws and fight fraud?
some Fed agency tax reform will reduce fraud and evasion. Also illegal aliens = tax evasion
I am not disagreeing with tax reform, but what agency will collect and enforce tax laws ? DOD? DHS? DOJ?
Making the IRS obsolete seems their goal. Something will have to enforce tax laws.
. Dream a little dream.
Please eliminate the DOE and NSA while ridding the country of unnecessary waste.
Exactly the kind of creative  thought process that's needed to make America Great again. Keep going
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS yes please!  What corruption binds us to this ridiculous system?
And I want fro-yo dispensers at every bus stop but it doesn't mean that it's a very practical idea.
AGREED! 10% Flat Tax. The time is now! Do your job! #FlatTaxNow
sure, flat tax for ALL without loopholes for the wealthy.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS if you can't abolish the IRS we need to at least hold them more accountable.  Earnings suspense file?
Go for it hope they do
@SenTedCruz but then @POTUS would have to pay something... :(
we can't abolish the IRS you melted GI Joe figure
Simple. 10% tax, without exemptions. Everyone, even the super rich. NO EXCEPTIONS!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS 
This is so important. Please work together to make this happen!  Make the IRS go away
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS How can we have 4th A freedom of our papers with a tax based on income? Go back to Orig Const EXCISE
how much money would we save by eliminating IRS??? makes me giddy
Agreed!
lol-"bold simplicity"=4th grade grammar?
Starting with eliminating mortgage deduction?
Sure he would - as long as the poor pay more than the rich.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Ted Cruz has the best idea I've ever heard for tax reform. Go Senator Cruz!!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS VAT tax..Our current monstrosity of a tax code must be abolished
Always liked the idea of a postcard. Makes sense to me. IRS needs done away with.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS sounds Good to me
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Abolish the IRS.  What they do is, for the most part, unconstitutional and illegal.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS tax simplicity--yes please!!
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Break up the IRS and make HOR reps heads over their districts. Just divide it up among the HOR reps.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS We all know what Trump thinks of Cruz and his wife/father. #LyinTed
that would be sweet
This would be action, just sayin'
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz and constituents would just love a bold statement with Ted. #TownHall
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS I wholeheartedly support this. U need an accountant and attorney to file taxes anymore. It's pathetic.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS   Flat taxes no income taxes for citizens and small business #fairtax plan in some form
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Forget the postcard!!! Go with NO CARD! NO IRS! #FairTax
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS Seems like a good way to allow rich people to pay less.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @POTUS amen!!
Would be nice, but beating the Establishment, the Special Interests, & the Dems, will be a tall order.
works for me, can I forget about taxes I haven't done yet from two years ago LOL
Hm, flat tax proposal, no exemptions. Might work depending on rate proposed.
And Trump can get a head start by firing the 15,000 IRS agents Barry Obama hired to enforce the Obamacare mandate.
Cruz has had this plan for months.. Good idea
here goes our economy down to a hole!!
from Cruz's ears to Trumpgod's
I dont believe @realdonaldtrump will ever approve this because then HE will finally have to pay taxes
I want the IRS to not see health information, I haven't heard one way or the other.
I just can't just to never  the name IRS it's just a  for intimidation
He's speaking to potus? Umm he doesn't like potus, what does this mean?  Run potus run!
Dismantling a huge government  orginazation like the IRS. Pipedream. He's looking to 2020
you are still in a dream mood
Been waiting to hear that with itchy ears. We got your back Ted!
It's a great idea, but lobbyist like H&R Block, CPA's & tax attorneys have a great influence.
Thank you Mr. Cruz for working with President Trump. Some Republicans are being cowards. We will remember.
<<FU for your hate of the USA @tedcruz sold out working with the most dishonorable, dishonest pile on the planet @ScottyWK
Yes. This!
definitely what trumps voters want having to pay a tax preparer is just another tax on the American people
did they talk about fascist optics of banning reputable press? What about the Russia/treason thing? Tax returns?
what about the US interference in the Israelis election I think we should talk about that too sounds 
IRS the arm of Obama. Got to go!!
no valid reason for IRS.
Just part of the bloviated government.  No need for S.S. either.
All have own S.S. acct.
CRUZ SHOULD SHUT UP & DROP DEAD ! 
make it a constitutional amendment
absolutely lets take a look at trump's current taxes and then transfer it to the cruz postcard so we can decide
Ted talked about this at his rallies and debates. Best. Idea. Ever.
lying Ted strikes again! I'm waiting for the town hall
Did he promise a town hall? If you follow @tedcruz you know he's working his tail off during this "recess." @POTUS @ScottyWK
BTW Cruz has also met with protestors several times this week both on the street & in his office. @tedcruz @POTUS @ScottyWK
IRS needs to be abolished. Corruption is rampant.
He also wants to say anything that will put him in a headline.
nothing wrong about that I like to hear about him even from the very fake press media
Please listen to @tedcruz We need drastic changes He is right #Abolish IRS 2 & save $$$ #MAGA Taxes are 2 complicated now @ScottyWK
did @tedcruz also speak to @POTUS about his ties with Russia and his cowardly attacks on the free press? Just curious.
What's the flag on the far right?
Christian Flag; they're in many churches & used at Christian events with color guard. @ScottyWK @tedcruz @POTUS
Abolish the IRS and then we will have money for wall and so much more.
well we all know that the leaders of IRS need to be fired!!
Where exactly would you then SEND the postcard? Perhaps some sort of revenue collection service, maybe internal...
A small office at treasury; many would actually file online. @ScottyWK @tedcruz @POTUS
A small office. To process several hundred million "postcards".
What could possibly go wrong?
The issue is simplicity & thus little fraud/mistakes/etc. Most will be filed online. @ScottyWK @tedcruz @POTUS
Most returns are filed online now. By tax preparers. E-file? On that topic how about hacking?
The key to this is simplicity; government already knows what average person made & paid in tax. @ScottyWK @tedcruz @POTUS
So with a flat tax & few deductions the filing is just to remit payment or request refund. @ScottyWK @tedcruz @POTUS
I agree with a flat tax. The corporations that fund these hacks however, don't. Cruz IS the swamp.
the voters didnâ€™t appear to want that, tbf
Hope it works out.
There's no way that's going to fly. His nose could be brown as crude oil and he ain't getting that done.
Does that mean u approve or disapprove?
that would be good!
Me too Gut IR Code. Its stupid, product of extreme lobbying, cronyism, #Leftist social engineering Cut the chains
Abolish the IRS? Now that's what I call a BOLD endeavor!  More power to him if he can succeed in that!
Now please!
I am all for that I hate those bastards at rhe IRS
Oh Please Please Please!
Yeah, all the way to clear simplicity and fairness! President Trump is right. Ted, support Donald all the way.
This was Cruz's idea not Trump's!
fake news all good ideas are trump's unless the end up being bad ideas
Distinguishing between good and bad, is not your strong point. IQ problem?
PLEASE, flat tax and abolish the IRS, Pretty Please???
I was $4500 due to IRS kept ignoring the collections attempt but learned the hard she my whole pay
check was gone with all the overtime I made for that pay period it was a miracle I survied the month
And then get rid of all the other useless agencies, one by one.
@Narno63 @tedcruz @POTUS hell yes I'm down for that
That's what I'm talking about TED
