HC coverage should be individual responsibility like paying for treatment if they don't have Ins. NOT Govt. There is already help for needy!
@Blackdi51264299 
Oh wait, you mean millions won't be dieing in the street & a wrath of diseases cast upon us all & ten years of darkness.
Junk insurance for poor, sick people is considered success?
Lies you tell
Only 30 million more to go!
So what we are at 20 million or so that still get screwed.....all to redistribute wealth up to top 1 percent.
How generous of you.
Listen to this man!!! @realDonaldTrump
Ted, no govt in healthcare means none not some just because you call it something else it's govt
Tom Price is a liar. CBO says you're both full of it.
Senator Cuz please point to the section in the constitution that covers healthcare? I cant find it and i am sick and tired of paying for it
HHS IS A HIGHLY BIASED evaluator !
No decent person would voluntarily be part of Hannity's propaganda. I recollect when it seemed you had integrity.
.@tedcruz once said:

Donald Trump is "a pathological liar who will betray you on every issue."  https://youtu.be/E5NEfsfjf8s 
Do you even pay attention to the CBO?
It's rather pathetic 2 watch as profiteering insurance leads elected congress members around on a leash through their latest obedient lesson
. sen cruz: please provide analysis from non-partisan organization. thanks!
Push it senator you have it right
STAY STRONG
EveryAmCitizenShouldBeAble2PaySomethingTowardHC.IfTheyWork!IveSeenYoungPeopleDrivingMatchingMercedesButWontPay4HC!
Lies supported by other liars doesn't make it true. All of the legit, trusted sources state your bill is a dumpster fire for almost everyone
Coverage that covers nothing...more GOP junk insurance.
BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!
Deductibles as high as $12000
Does not score BCRA with Cruz amendment.  Scores ACA with Amendment.  Apples and oranges. Deceptive.
Does it count as coverage if it doesn't include drugs, or cancer treatment, or any number of base services that are necessary for health.
Not credible.  HHS won't show work.
To bad the coverage offered won't cover people's needs
Yeah I'll believe Price who made $ illegally w/pharmaceutical companies-insider knowledge over non-partisan CBO You're truly a Devil spawn.
More talk no action im sick of politicians getting on thier soap box proclaiming to the world we have the answers yet we still have O care
@JohnCornyn why are two most corrupt & deceitful senators in Congress (both Koch brothers lapdogs) from TX? years of sucking up to big oil?
Enough of the B.S. already!  Fully repeal the TAX known as ob☭m☭C☭re.  Nothing else will suffice. @SenRandPauI
A liar repeating lies.
With basically no benefits, great!
You lie so effortlessly is scary
CBO said it's horseshit. #Fail
...so add that to the 11 million who lose insurance and BINGO- Ayn Rand weeps with joy!
Oh so only 20 million people will not have health insurance. Not 22 million. Way to go!!!
@POTUS needs to sign a executive order that all senators now use Obama care for thier ins. Bet things would change fast then!
**their
Men without integrity compassion wisdom plus liars are unacceptable untrustworthy leaders.
Does your amendment cover pulling the knife out of your back that Sean stabbed you with?
Coverage doesn't matter if it's worthless and the people that have it can't use it for anything. It's also segregating the sick. Shameful
Great. But if you ask Dems what are you going to do with the 500 Million people that will lose health ins?
Perhaps, but your colleagues do not want to lift the American people's burden. They might lose their kickbacks.
Witness evil being spread...
It's disgusting that his proposals aren't already in the bill. Shame on @SenateMajLdr
Ted, come on. You can say everything is terrible and no one knows what to do- nobody believes you aren't smart enough to see it.
CBO determined different.

Doesn't it not really matter since the bill will still have taken insurance away from 20 million?
Go away Teddie.
Then you should have no problem waiting for the CBO score.

What do the insurance companies say about it?
Lies.
