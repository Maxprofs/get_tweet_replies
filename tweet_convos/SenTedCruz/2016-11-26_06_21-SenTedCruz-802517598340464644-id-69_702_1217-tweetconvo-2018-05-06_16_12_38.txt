true, so why are you trying to replace him with Dictator #Trump.  Trump is an evil communist supporter. #dumptrump
Those that mourn his passing never saw, or ignored, the ppl risking 90 miles open ocean to escape his rule.
But it's good to see the end of him, even so.
@jaketapper 
Bush doesn't care about black ppl, & he murdered 650K Iraqis.

CASTRO trained 80k doctors free(Amer,Eur,Afri,etc).
Castro didn't train them for free. The money came from the Cuban ppl. Nothing is free. Someone pays!
Stopped Ebola outbreaks in Africa & sent Doctors all over the world.
So I guess you think that absolves him of all the evil he did to his own people?
EVERY U.S. leader has MORE blood on their hands, and he was in charge longer.
.@SenTedCruz @hpyrancher Very True. but millions of Cubans may never have come the USA and enjoyed success & shaped our nation w/o Castro
a Hi alot of ppl who feel Cuba is totally free from tyranny don't realize Raul is still in power!
Hugs for you, your family and your Father today.  #Cuba
But there are many Cubans dancing in the streets of Miami after his death.  What is that about?

@jaketapper But can't it open the door to a new era, change the dynamic?
Depends on them @SenTedCruz @jaketapper
I agree, do you think anything will change under Raul> forgetaboutit.
Fidel Castro, who died late Friday night, was a tyrant who oppressed Cubans and brought misery to many for several decades
This hardline tweet is a small example of your hypocrisy that ppl hate about you. Why don't you hold ALL leaders to same stndrds
I would of voted for you if Trump would of not been in the race I believe you have the true heart of a true American
Thank you!
Why couldn't YOU be our president-elect?  Oh yes, identity politics   Miss you!
@mercedesschlapp  So true. Raul isn't any better.
Last post:  Wasn't Fulgencio Batista, also a Cuban Dictator? Was he better or worse than Castro?
@cnn is doing interviews of people in Cuba who remember Castro as a "hero" and not reporting on Castro's crimes #journalism
You should see the official statement from our joke of a leader.

Yet your hateful father fought alongside Fidel Castro & participated in causing those deaths you spoke of. Hypocritical asshole!
Well said. Sad that Obama won't state the truth, the death of a brutal dictator. He's afraid his Cuban legacy is also at stake.
It brings a little comfort.
But perhaps it brings hope for the future.
Well said Ted
@walterhallam
nor can your disdain
why don't you worry about the plight of Native Americans instead of giving their land away to some oil company go back to Canada
@jaketapper Maybe Ted can move back & be president there....USA win.
are you celebrating someone's death? Dude...
@jaketapper Thank you for sharing your important feelings on this. https://twitter.com/adamserwer/status/802510747997794304 …
@jaketapper Is that why your dad helped to take out JFK?
@jaketapper Neither could US sanctions and aggression. Only caused more suffering which US and other capitalist benefited from
But can it bring hope? Who is his successor?
@jaketapper ditto for the death of America
@jaketapper right, because the USA doesn't kill people
@jaketapper But it opens the endless comparisons to Trump!
@jaketapper neither are the death of US backed Pinochet, Videla, etc in South America who killed & tortured thousands
You could say that about #AnyUSAPresident
Way to go Ted
.@SenTedCruz nor can America's victories (if ever) in #Iraq or #Afghanistan. Not just thousands, but 100s of thousands! Don't point fingers
what about the victims of your country? The Vietnamese, Africans, Iraqis, etc! #hypocrisy go bend over for #trump #sellout
Shouldn't you be kissing Trump's ass instead of tweeting right now?
Agreed, but he's gone now, time to rebuild....
It is a momentous event for the Cuban-American community
Castro may have been to you guys " A Son of a Bitch" but to us he remains a freedom fighter and friend of the oppressed people!
what about the thousands of oppressed people in Cuban jails for insulating Castro
I do not know about that and if it's true then it is unfair but we cannot write him off because of that alone
It may not bring back the dead, but you're wrong about it not bringing comfort to the families, knowing he can kill no more
l
Well said. Tears in the mist o celebratikn.
how I feel as a Cuban?? So happy but can't wait to see his brother Raul dead too for a complete happiness
thank God for jubilee there's no AC in Hell, finally he met his match.
no but we can surely celebrate his forever existence in hell.
Perfectly stated, Senator Cruz.
