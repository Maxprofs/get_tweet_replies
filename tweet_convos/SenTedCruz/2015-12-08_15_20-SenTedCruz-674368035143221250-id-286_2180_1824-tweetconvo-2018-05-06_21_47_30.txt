@AlWaleedbinT @dobermankahn @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry after the virgins?
@AlWaleedbinT @dobermankahn @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry and with you also
@SenTedCruz @JeremyinAkron All Kerry did is cite a scientist’s projection, not proclaim that he did the research himself.
@samuelldrew shouldn't site statistics unless you are confident they are true. Kerry must have felt they were @SenTedCruz @JeremyinAkron
@Texgalleslie @SenTedCruz @JeremyinAkron Just like you shouldn’t use words unless you know how to spell them?
@samuelldrew Libs always point out spelling errors because they have no argument. No substance. #epicfail  L8bs@SenTedCruz @JeremyinAkron
@Texgalleslie @JeremyinAkron I’m not a liberal.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry none of you politicians are scientists. Put a lid on yourselves.
@Rose_Marie_Holt @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry She "would do it for free," but she doesn't. How do you know her profit motive is irrelevant?
@DWinSTL @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry I've known her forever. She worked for NOAA & now at MIT. She could do way better in private.
@Rose_Marie_Holt @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Private doesn't equate to "for free."
@DWinSTL Didn'http://t.Work.in .private. And not for sale. Next reply gets you a link to a fun talk everyone wd benefit from.
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 @JohnKerry Oh what a surprise
@SenTedCruz @mdsmelser @JohnKerry He was pretty freaking close. Don't be an idiot.
@chitowngal1204  @mdsmelser @JohnKerry he was close? I am pretty sure the Arctic is still frozen...havent been there so I can't say 4 sure..
@TwistedinGa @mdsmelser @JohnKerry have you seen how much we've lost? I've been there. Have you?
@chitowngal1204 @mdsmelser @JohnKerry i believe I said....yes I did say I have never been there!...what else have u missed?
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry  ARCTIC ICE HAS NEVER BEEN THICKER SINCE MEASUREMENTS BEGAN MANY, MANY, MANY  DECADES AGO!
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry I would pay big money to watch Cruz debate Hillary on "climate change".
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry but made his buddy #algore filthy rich...next in line #Obama
@salpie Remember: Woman from UN said, MM Global Warming, now known

@thundley4 @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry I Know. He's liberal scum. Always has been.
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 @JohnKerry in 2000, CIA stated that by 2007 the sealevel would be up by 7 meters and large parts of W europa gone
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry ●Kerry has been wrong about everything. Even his comrades in the Swift Boats can't stand his grandstanding and lies.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Entirely wrong...Increasing population &demand for energy can go on forever on a finite planet w/out consequences.
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 @JohnKerry Nice phrase "Dogma before Data".  I might use it if no one's copyrighted it.

@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry
@SenTedCruz oKAY, kerry's not a scientist, but it doesn't discount the fact that ice caps are melting extremely rapidly bc of CO2 ffs
@SenTedCruz @JohnnyUtah27 @JohnKerry  I guess I missed that.  What was under the ice?
@SenTedCruz do you even science?
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry This reflects that he actually believes in the so called science or he really didn't think about it enough to know..
@SenTedCruz @TrucksHorsesDog @JohnKerry Sen Cruz is a Good man, will be a perfect VP and after 8 years a great president, good man
@SenTedCruz @TrucksHorsesDog @JohnKerry I don't believe anything, that comes out of John Kerry 's mouth.

@SenTedCruz @AZPatriot01 @JohnKerry They always do, then when it doesn't , want more money
@SenTedCruz  only a few really dumb people believed @JohnKerry even then.
@SenTedCruz @PatVPeters @JohnKerry  The problem is that Kerry's IQ is about the same as the average artic temp.
@SenTedCruz @tribaltrust1 @JohnKerry Yep, not declining THAT quickly. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Arctic_September_sea_ice_decline.png/1024px-Arctic_September_sea_ice_decline.png …

"@SenTedCruz: Aug '09 Sen @JohnKerry said Arctic would be ice-free by '13. Dogma before data, he was entirely wrong "
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry all lies and hypocrisy, unachievable, more money out of our pockets to feed their utter garbage

Liberal fail..lol
@SenTedCruz @GerryCallahan @JohnKerry Its a planet not your living room. There is not a thermostat.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry It would be a shorter list to state the 'truthful' statements by John Kerry than the false statements
@SenTedCruz @VitoandVitoShow @JohnKerry I had water under my washing machine. Does that count?
@SenTedCruz @EPS1991 @JohnKerry Laughable!!
@SenTedCruz @RotNScoundrel @JohnKerry Tell Alaskan state troopers that.1 trooper in 7 hrs can't cover 1/16 of his territory. It's all ice.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Reporting in Live from Houston, we are still dry but in a bunker awaiting floods. Can we get some rations dropped in?
@SenTedCruz @TXFairTaxer @JohnKerry The Poles were ice free 3.5m yrs. ago. CO2 was 400ppm. Great forests in Siberia. Whose fault was that?
@tengkds @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry The Republican's!
@SenTedCruz @mkues65 @JohnKerry By contrast, John Kerry has been brain-free since birth.
Keep betting against the future of humanity, @SenTedCruz because you won't be president until we're all gone.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry  Thank you for your No vote on Common Core advancement, Sen. Cruz.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Every one of those "scientists" should be stripped of their degree. happens for a Dr. or lawyer for malpractice ynot?
@SenTedCruz @SolomonAlana @JohnKerry They said Arctic will be ice free for shipping in late '60s when the Manhattan sailed thru. Still not.
@SenTedCruz @danieltobin @JohnKerry When the Liberals start selling their homes in the Hamptons I'll worry about the sea levels rising .

@AaronBallman @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry open source and open data for climate science. Please! How can you do science review without those two.
@AaronBallman @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Things like this worry me http://goo.gl/fbLa  "probably tampered with Russian-climate data.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry John and his 'ketchup' queen wife are potheads, dopers
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry @gerster_kaylene When can we bury this snake oil and actually address some real environmental issues?
@SenTedCruz @vernadean47 @JohnKerry
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry lying fear mongering is one thing. Now climate change Nazis want limit meat choice & protein causing malnourishment.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry when will media run story of blackman burning white men with gas fire?
@SenTedCruz Kerry and people in office like him are very Danger to this Country. They be leave in one world order not in the Constitution
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Kerry is an idiot and part of the problem
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry the data at the time showed a nosedive in permanent ice.
@SenTedCruz @reg1776 @JohnKerry God put us here fight for freedom and show the world.
@SenTedCruz @jjauthor @JohnKerry good thing he kept that gig with the Addams family
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry lol!!
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Perhaps he had plans to use the ice for his next soiree.
@SenTedCruz @GerryCallahan @JohnKerry We didn't believe him then, but the changing climate is real, just very gradual.  Bad example here.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry And yet, the Gathering of Morons in Paris fails to notice that this prediction was a teeny bit off.
@SenTedCruz @JGBartholomew @JohnKerry he's not a scientist
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry perhaps he was talking about the drug named ice.... or the treat coconut ice?
@SenTedCruz @niebais1 @JohnKerry "You misunderstood my Denver accent. I said my 'attic' will be ice free by the summer of 2013." -John Kerry
@GivemHekBrigham @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry It's settled science.  Our polar ice caps are gone....oh wait...
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry  Tell that to Robert Redford.
@SenTedCruz @KHerriage @JohnKerry What is the victory here?  "See? He was wrong.  We don't need maintain clean air and water."
@SenTedCruz @Eagle_Vision @JohnKerry I predict that the Arctic will be ketchup free any minute now. #57waystoleaveyouriceberg
@SenTedCruz @juanma_lz @JohnKerry Juanma, q sea una predicción equivocada no sirve para descartar el fondo de la conversación
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Kerry a traitor to our country. Have not seen where he has ever acmplis'd  anything of value in his political career.
@SenTedCruz @EricSteeleLive @JohnKerry john kerry....makes obumr look average
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Remember when "more doctors choose Pall Mall"?  Sometimes " "smart people " are wrong.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry So, I shouldn't pack Bermuda shorts?
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry  Mr Cruz why don't you breath in some more oil fumes. You must be brain dead. Most Americans believe in Climatechange
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry To be fair...@JohnKerry is wrong about everything...
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry -This should show Americans that  Climate change is a HOAX.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry he is wrong on most issues.
@SenTedCruz @HeyTammyBruce @JohnKerry

John Kerry is a dolt, groomed by the anti-American Left b/c of his testimony denouncing his country.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry uh-huh. What foresight. Can't wait for the next prediction.
@SenTedCruz @TBradleyNC @JohnKerry Alimentary for progressives like Mr Kerry, considering where their heads lie.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry 
Senator Cruz is right on the money; the alarmist claims of climate catastrophe are a hoax & even worse they a lie.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry :Hell will freeze over before Kerry catches a clue!
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry He also thought he could make a deal with Iran!! Who's the dumber SS? Clinton or Kerry? Tough Questn.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods  This is the same guy who is setting our middle east policy #scary
@russfelix @SenTedCruz @JohnKerry the White House.

@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry John Kerry lied.  It's what he & fellow Dems do.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry it's amazing these clowns get away with saying this propaganda and nobody holds them accountable.
@SenTedCruz @GerryCallahan @JohnKerry everybody knows Kerry's only relevant because he married a Heinz. He is a total turd. Respectfully IMA
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry hes always wrong

@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry nothing but lies all about money
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods dear @johnkerry please put on the tin-foil hat and sit over there next to @algore
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Yeah right! Kerry is a loser!
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry don't let facts get in the way of a good story
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry voted for the ice to be gone before he voted against it.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry What HASN'T Kerry been wrong about. That is a lot shorter list.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry john kerry IS, WAS, and will ALWAYS be delusional!  NOTHING he says has any value to me!
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry what a genius
@SenTedCruz wasn't he also on boats in Nam, wearing a superman cape? Tired of these manipulators.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry @rtoberl @g_makay @BettyBoopDooper @dallas_413 @GretchenInOK @bullcook11 Not 2 worry, He's good with Iran Nuke Deal!!
@SenTedCruz  @MarkSteynOnline @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Such a SCAM of massive proportions.  Thanks for fighting on our behalf!  #Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry It was as stupid as those who give a date for the end times, when it doesn't happen look foolish
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Old Horse face,wrong again.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Well how about that and the sky isn't falling either!
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Idiotx. He could have been prez?  Seriously stupid.  Oh wait, he's sec of state.  God save us! Dems can't, won't!
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry  False prophet!!!  He wants to punish nonbelievers of climate change... perhaps we should punish false prophets  ;-)
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry When Al Gore was born, only 7000 polar bears existed. Now there are over 30,000.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry oooooo so close
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Global warning SCAM should be a FELONY, just like all other scams are felonies.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Says the man who would put his religion over the constitution. You're both pious frauds.
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry come on that muppet looking mofo is a joke...
@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @JohnKerry Hi there, we still have Ice in Northern Alberta, will update when its warm
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry maybe John was against ice before he was for it?
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry To quote Scrooge, Kerry, Gore, and all the other nut jobs should be boiled in their own oil.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry some people should stick to their schooling... Political Science not = Science.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Everybody knows Kerry is just an orc mouthpiece! But the Al Gore got wealthy saying such idiocy.
@SenTedCruz @DFredregill @JohnKerry arctic ice will still be there in 2313! Unless Jesus Comes 1st.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Oops. And isn't it next month that the Goracle's prediction falls to dust?
@SenTedCruz John Kerry is probably more of a scientist than Bill Nye, neither one qualified to do much of anything other than comedy
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Now there's scientific proof, once and for all, that climate change does not exist! I will sleep better tonight.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Big surprise. John Kerry wrong. And is still wrong about so much. Keep up the good work John. You might get 1 right.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry old johnboy was hoping for higher water to sail on
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry he meant when he reached the intellectual age of 13
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry He would tell you he was against the data before he was for it though. That should count for something.
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Liberals are truth twisters and they get away with it!
@SenTedCruz and you're putting your dogma (aka Christianity) ahead of women's rights, individuals rights... so...
@SenTedCruz And this was not the consensus of the research community, quit spreading false conclusions you false prophet
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Is that after the odometer rolls over?
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry Climate change is a non issue compared to $19 Trillion national debt. Fix that or America won't be around.
@SenTedCruz, are you willing to put data before dogma, because there is a lot of data on the side of AGW?
@SenTedCruz @JohnKerry @TeaPartyOrg @AppSame @POTUS @JudicialWatch
@SenTedCruz @EB_imconfus @JohnKerry GW cultists completely ignore their failed predictions & demand we bow before their false idol!
