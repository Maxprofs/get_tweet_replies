To bad you support this.
Ted Cruz’s health plan is simple: ask sick people to pay more
Ted Cruz did write TrumpCare. He wrote an amendment to that garbage bill that provides choice. You can even keep your beloved  ObamaCare.
I cannot understand why people want the gov't to dictate what their healthcare should be.
Because they're brainwashed?
#FullRepeal! #GetGovernmentOutOfOurLivesSoWeCanActuallyLive! #OptOut!
@swargcoming @macansharp @cala_1111 @ThatsMissThot2U @Laffingmom @nvrggivup @1RedTulie @tlsg99 Thanks Ted!  We're all proud of you in Texas!
Less than ~17% support this death panel. Don't pass any bill that costs lives. A price you can't afford. @GOP's disregard noticed. #Impeach
Exactly the way to go! Keep obama care but allow others and LET ME CHOOSE!
Cruz is untrustworthy!
Its not a real choice it forces u to choose between paying your mortgage or healthcare that provides decent coverage!
Didn't know it was published with pricing yet...u must be in the know!
Give up JDP. Julie doesn't believe in scientific research. She likes to learn the hard way.
And what do u care if we get choices ? And it's insurance not healthcare jeez
This is comical. Do you believe medical ins is a separate issue from healthcare?
This is ignorance is beyond comprehension!
Insurance & healthcare r joined at the hip! The GOP bill is NOT offering healthcare that is true!
Ted Cruz’s health plan is simple: ask sick people to pay more
Senator Ted Cruz, we were promised a Full Repeal! Keep the promise! #FullRepealonly! UnitedforFreedom
Freedom hinges on the ability to keep& spend our wages as we see fit. Repeal Ocare and get out of the way! Deregulate. Free market medicine.
I oppose the BCRA & your amendment. I want you to vote no. Everyone I know wants you to vote no. Why won't you answer your phone or fax?
We are the GOP and we want to deny healthcare to many millions. We don't care about our constituents, the American people.
Teddy, we American care about the healthcare bill etc. we also give a dam about treason or traders. Are you kidding Mr Constitution.
Ted - I'm not in DC and I care about the Russian interference. A lot! And you should, too! Trump is a traitor!
Thank you 4 fighting against socialism, Marxism, communism, any ism. It's all I can say right now. Other than #FullRepeal. #UnitedForFreedom
Trump administration is fighting for authoritarianism and the dismantling of democracy.
Obamacare is stabilizing.I am your constituent & I want my Obamacare fixed not repealed or replaced-a bipartisan fix
Government needs to get out of healthcare!
Please hold fast with your amendment and don't give into @SenateMajLdr and the other Rhinos.
I like your idea, allow ins co's to issue high deductible catastrophic plans, then maybe my 63 yr wife's plan would go down fm $710/mo!
wish our Senators from Arizona were leading the way on healthcare reform the way that you are. #CruzControl
Full repeal of socialized medicine in America. #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom Sen. Cruz. I am mostly disappointed in you. 
Health Bill so good that ALL Republican senators should have to have it

If you missed all the constituents who want to talk about how horrible your healthcare plan is, you could attend a town hall in Texas.
#REPEALOBAMACARE! NO trumpcare or Obamacare! #CruzAmendment! #UnitedforFreedom! #FreeMarketOnly!
What can't you guys agree on anything. It is frustrating and embarrassing.  Get healthcare done learn to compromise !
I would rather watch paint peel than listen to that Greed of Party. Listen to your constiuents!  #lookingforwardtomidterms
Full repeel no replacement united for freadom
Legislate any insurer to any 1 State must provide equal insurance to all States at equal cost. Do your job & quit mandating to working class
Do you really believe that when only 30% of Texans want the ACA replaced that your support of repeal & replace won't have long term effects?
Any chance you have a daughter who could take over for you (like Ivanka), since your own healthcare ideas are so wildly unpopular.
I'm your constituent and I do not support this bill! It hurts the average American while cutting taxes on wealthy. Give us single payer!!
Just a gutless coward who bows to Trump, no honor, no dignity, just Trump worship.
Just another example of how great Texas IS NOT; ur a senator there. Keep ur head up Trumps a$$, or he'll start attacking ur family again.
Elections are coming. Please consider what the majority of the people want or your party will be run out.
I can tell you this,if y'all don't repeal this mess,all will be voted out!Y'all made a promise for yrs to repeal & u better get it done!
You've ID'd the solution to HC! How do WE THE PEOPLE, besides electing our representatives, EXERT OUR SOVEREIGNTY? Here is the best answer…
Hopefully GOP can get this bill passed.  I am concerned over the increase (X's 5) in senior health premiums.  Will also lose their votes.
Any many of those seniors will lose their lives because how many people on a fixed income can afford 16K a year?
Damn loved the idea of that plan. Dont subsidize the sick with the healthy's premiums, subsidize them with tax payer funds. Makes sense 2 me
Your "leader" clearly doesn't identify with your party.
For years, even as a "civilian," I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!
What party does he represent, exactly?  United Russia?
Either you wan't to fix Obamacare cuz it will help people or you want to destroy something a black man built. TELL THE TRUTH CRUZ.
Spawn of Satan Cruz if you play it backwards it says "I serve Satan to destroy America & I will set up millions to die without healthcare"
Hope you roast in hell! You know better. putting profit over people and party, profit over our citizens welfare. you will go down
Rather than giving billons to the ins co, put $75 million in a HSA for the uninsured, and allow them to self-pay their providers.

Wow you guys are finally working, make $200k yr. barely work a 100 days a year. If wasn't so sad be funny.
Ted,it is my belief that Insurance Companies have incredible wealth. Not just money, but huge assets. They need to help with the Ins.Plan
Your ambition isn't connected to talent, acumen, or any kind of moral compass. It's an untethered force in a bad suit.
OMG.....you nailed it!!!!
Thank you for working to keep the promise that was made to Americans to REPEAL ACA not repackage it! Pres. Trump made that promise as well
You neglected to thank him for killing me (giving the oks to states to bring back lifetime max on EE plans)
Mr. Cruz, Remove Government Regulation desined to make sure Insurance Company's can't fail and let Doctors form allianses to compet
Your children will curse you for being a traitor to America, @SenTedCruz
Probably not. He's raising them. They are privileged and face no challenges & have more opportunities in life.
The wealthy get a huge tax break but the middle class and poor will suffer.

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
Ty!  Repeal this crap now, & then talk reforms.  But start reform w hlth care provider costs because that's the problem!
Get health care done. 8 years. GET It DONE. No more free hand out, kick backs and taxes. Nothing for illegals or refugees @POTUS #MAGA
Senate Republicans need to act!  Time to lower premiums for the workers and businesses of America!
The Deceitful GOP will lower premium deductible but quadruple your deductible! Getting health care that has decent coverage w/b Unaffordable
JDP see the trend? GOP supporters only consider one thing: premiums. They don't consider anything beyond.
A survey recently found that less than 1/2 of GOP lemmings knew we had or could name the 3 branches of gov't. Not the sharpest tools in shed
#nothingbutlies
Gop needs to take control of hcare agenda from dems
@SenTedCruz How would you stop all the drug traffic that is at Epidemic portions here in the US that the Obama Admin has burden the US with?
Missed that.... did catch you deflecting from questions about Chuck Grassley, answering instead a non question about Chuck Schumer
Did god tell you it was ok to lie?
So what do you think is our president complicit or what ?
JUST REPEAL IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP Get this done for the American people Tired of hard working folks going broke on insurance! @FoxNews  @realDonaldTrump
Its expensive because of GOP sabotage instead of fixing it! Under the Trump Care plan u will get terrible coverage or it w/b unaffordable!
JDP it's another one. He doesn't understand beyond the premium.
Its difficult to accept shallowness that profound is commonplace!
GOP's the fake news party so they hate doing the math & it doesn't add up!
I'll give it a miss cheers Ted.
Action. Senate had been discussing for almost 8 years.
#Discussing the #REPEAL like you #PROMISEX I would hope.
