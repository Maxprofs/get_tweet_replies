@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Merry Christmas!
@SenTedCruz No such thing as a savior for you, you POS. Go back to Cuba, um, Canada? #NotBornHere #TrumpSaysGoHomeImmigrant.
@SenTedCruz No Feliz Navidad? Turning your back on your language too?? figures
@SenTedCruz What lord? Allah? Zeus? Odin? Or your fat Canadian pockets?
@SenTedCruz I wouldn't want a POTUS who promoted his own religion above that of others' anyway. Happy Holidays to all Americans.
@SenTedCruz JESUS was born in June...if he was even real...
@SenTedCruz merry Christmas Ted. And good luck to you.
@SenTedCruz merry Christmas to you Senator Cruz
@SenTedCruz Jesus I've heard about would find you disgusting, pal.
@RossLeslieGuy @SenTedCruz why's that Ross?:-)
@SenTedCruz Christ's b-day was moved to coincide w/ Jewish & Pagan customs. Shepherds abiding in the fields w/ flocks...in Winter? Nah.
@SenTedCruz  Chirst wasn't born in December. It was Spring, first harvest & tax season. Read the New Testament & stop spreading lies. Thanks
@SenTedCruz - #theocracy
@SenTedCruz Make sure you ask the lord if it's okay to send young men and women to die in the mid-east#Republicans
@SenTedCruz good to know your PR team made this on canva
@SenTedCruz according to your book, that fairytale one, christ was born in the summer. Not December. December is solstice, pagan celebration
@SenTedCruz   Ted Cruz's Worst Nightmare Is "Fee" Credibility Gap Now, What Do You Want From Live, Remote #Control

@SenTedCruz Merry Christmas to you Senator Cruz! May the Lord bless you Heidi, Caroline, and Catherine too!
@SenTedCruz um Fyi, Jesus was not born on Dec 25th!  #wintersolstice #itsallamyth 
@SenTedCruz and we celebrate doing unto others. Just doing unto others. No more. Because that's  what God told me.
@SenTedCruz Actually...even the Bible says otherwise.
@cbcwatcher8 kinda missing the point of Christmas, aren't you? The date isn't the importance of the holiday, but what happened on it.
@SenTedCruz ah yes, I remember it so clearly!
@SenTedCruz Merry Christmas....and because of the first amendment you can say this and not have to be PC saying happy holidays to pls libs
@SenTedCruz Jesus was sent here on a rescue mission for all of us. Merry Christmas! Go Ted!
@SenTedCruz

https://goo.gl/15kLja  #cruzcrew Answering @SenTedCruz, Ted Cruz now on #2 among GOP recent day on Twitter mentions
@SenTedCruz @spyguy8080 
 Untrustworthy Cruz establishment puppet now
@SenTedCruz So many truly sad, confused people responding. Seeing hopelessness in lives is so tiring. May they find Christ.
@SenTedCruz  May you & cam have a blessed Christmas and a very successful 2016
@SenTedCruz Christ was born in the summer and definitely not in december. Maybe have facts next time.
@LaughtTheLamp @SenTedCruz Christmas is only celebrated in December, but the date isn't referenced because it's not important.
@Burkealurk @SenTedCruz so the birth of your savior isnt important? Glad you agree with me.
@LaughtTheLamp @SenTedCruz not what I said, the actual date isn't important. His life and death are much more important
@Burkealurk @SenTedCruz the time when most christians choose to believe and attend church is based on their belief that the lord was born
@LaughtTheLamp @SenTedCruz it's just a traditional date incorporated from pagan religions, the Bible makes no claim to a date.
@SenTedCruz #MerryChristmas as we celebrate the birth of our Savior #JesusChrist
@SenTedCruz And Merry Christmas to you & yours, Senator Cruz! Thank you for your leadership. Press on!!!
@SenTedCruz Merry Christmas
@SenTedCruz Amen and May we all remember Jesus is the reason for the season. To our next new President. Were voting for you
@SenTedCruz Another would be minister. Save it for the pulpit. #FirstAmendment
@SenTedCruz Merry Christmas to you and your family!
@SenTedCruz It sounds so good to hear the future POTUS referring to the main reason for Christmas!
@sentedcruz And let us refelct on politicians who are the embodiment of the seven deadly sins.
@BinghamtonDaily @SenTedCruz Like Ted Cruz.
@SenTedCruz
