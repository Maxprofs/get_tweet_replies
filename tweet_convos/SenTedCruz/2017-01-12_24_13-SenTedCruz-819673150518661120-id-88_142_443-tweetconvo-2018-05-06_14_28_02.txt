@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @MSNBCMorningJoe @YouTube No, this is a bad idea! You will weaken USA and strengthen Putin. Rethink.
The opposite is true.
American taxpayers would rather  defund Israel the only apartheid country in the mid-East

You're disgraceful! A Two-state solution is US policy
Impossible to achieve unless and until Hamas/Plo recognizes Isreal

OMG the IDIOTS club!  Cut off funding to Congressmen and Senators.  NO BENIFITS either!
on the playground w/ "wait till my big brother gets here" rhetoric.I voted against him due to!
Rubio is a hot head who doesn't think his actions or words through,the type that starts fights
2 leave wiggle room before being totally briefed.He was right not 2 b a race house w/ blinders
war crimes in Syria, perhaps more of them, which could come back on us.So, Tillerson was right
and our arming of some very dodgy people in Syria (no matter our intent) who also committed
around as a Sec of State, I would size up UN Security Coun,, ICC, Moves in UK to try Brits..
negotiator. Term "war criminal" for Syria is tricky. Before I would throw that "legal" term...
STEADY, MEASURED and UNFLAPPABLE. Moreover, he wears a poker face...traits of a cunning..
I was impressed with Tillerson.He's astute, intelligent, honest, humble, attentive 2 detail...
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @MSNBCMorningJoe @YouTube make sure you confirm Tillerson while you're a republican.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @MSNBCMorningJoe @YouTube  This is something to be proud of ? I really need 2 re think 4 who I vote 4
you are a warmonger sir. Worse yet, you demonstrate ceremonial opposition only.  Do real work
I appreciate your response to Trump today. Peace is a good thing and the grownup usually starts it.
We should get rid of UN. Kick them out of America.
Heartwarming to see you and Trump on the same side. Together you will make America great.  Go Lindsey.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @MSNBCMorningJoe @YouTube So when refugees flee terror, the UN won't have the money to help them?
is Un paying to flood refugees into other countries. If so save the$$.
Cut off the U.N. and kick them out!!!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz sometimes we need friends to remind us how strong we can be.thanks for the support and friendship.
Sure, throw Europe under the bus. NATO is next.
REPUBLICAN BS .
Ridiculous!
You realize that US allies incl UK, France, Spain, Japan, Ukraine...ALL voted for Res 2234.
all those wrongs don't make it right. Just following Obamas failed leadership.
Not only should the USA cut off all funding, we should get them out of the country.
Thank you
ICYMI: you took away my ability to own my own biz and have healthcare last night.
I don't I blame them for repealing healthcare for ppl with pre-existing conditions at 1:30 am last night.
Has anyone looked at the tweets of the "fine" Christians supporting this?  None of them support healthcare for the poor .
2 Oh, & I'm Christian but I vote on more than hate AND I don't believe Putin is the savior mentioned in the bible...
3 Need more proof that these people think Putin is the savior mentioned in the bible ... here's Franklin Graham ..
4 Wait whatttt? More? Busting your Christian balls on why you are all in on Putin love .. HE IS NOT A SAVIOR .. http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-03-11/news/bal-whos-got-a-crush-on-putin-the-american-right-wing-commentary-20140310_1_conservatives-putin-senate-gop-caucus …
Shame on you!
Jesus Christ...as if things cannot get any worse
oh I didn't miss it. I simply didn't watch it. I get physically ill watching Ted Cruz.
Real Leadership on full display! Now let's see if the rest of congress has any courage to do the right thing
#BoycottNBC
why isn't ur office answering calls? Maybe because people want our secretary picks? U McCain Rubio trying to play games
I've seen the crap you believe .. Moscow is not the third Roman Empire and Putin is no one's savior ...
I appreciate your service,but why this vote sir?
You and I wouldn't agree on too much but we definitely agree on this one. Good job!
at the UN the word is no money no veto.
Why you think you deserve insurance and other Americans don't .. answer don't be a coward .. you work for me ...  answer.
None of your offices are answering their phones ... I can come to you .. what time works for you next week?  Face me .. don't be a coward.
Don't have that time yet .. tweet at me Sir ... happy to hear your side in person and then get my turn ... come at me ..
And that time would be?  I want to explain to you in person why you are no more deserving of insurance than those who are poor .. the time?
Every person in our Country deserves healthcare. If it's so unimportant why does congress have such great coverage?
You need to get a Bible ... you are leading us down the wrong path with God .. please listen.   You are #wrong
not cool, we need leaders in support of our world order
