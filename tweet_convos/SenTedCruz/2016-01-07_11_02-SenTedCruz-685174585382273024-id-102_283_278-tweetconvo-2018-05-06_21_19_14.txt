@elohimis1 @SenTedCruz terrorism has NO connection with Islam as a religion. You need 2 stop watching that @FoxNews crap you feed on.
@MlamuliSA @SenTedCruz @FoxNews Really? http://www.islam-watch.org/Sami/Islam-Tolerant-Religion-Kill-the-Infidels.htm … We know the truth!
@SenTedCruz Please, you don't give a damn about Charlie Hebdo. You entertain your would-be constituents w/tales of terrorism to scare up $$
@Didikatz @SenTedCruz "Tales of Terrorism?" Do you read the news or listen to anything other than CNN?
@elohimis1 Terrorism is not in dispute, but @SenTedCruz "concern" about Charlie Hebdo except in how it can bring him campaign donations
@Didikatz @elohimis1 @SenTedCruz Your very skeptical about a good man wanting to save our Country. You must be a Democrat.
@Foxhaven1127 @elohimis1 @SenTedCruz A "good man" doesn't accept amnesty as an immigrant & then deny amnesty to others.
@Didikatz @Foxhaven1127 @SenTedCruz We have terrorists in our country because of this administration and you want to let more in? WAKE UP!
@Bifs01e01 @SenTedCruz We want him to grow a pair! As the drones fly ISIS grows. WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT TELL YOU? WAKE UP!
@Bifs01e01 @SenTedCruz Bif, get your head out of your ASS. French, Belgians, Germans and English thought that. Obama letting Terrorists in.
@SenTedCruz Cruz is illegally Running For President, Cruz Needs 2 Stop
@SenTedCruz  GETTING RID IF THE I.R.S. WOULD MALE U A TRAIL BLAZER, NEVER FORGET YR THE ATTORNEY , NOT TRUMP
@SenTedCruz  Yr the Attorney, not Trump. Those who know the score, including leaders names could beat Hill the weasel.
@SenTedCruz HONESTLY IN ALL SERIOUSNESS R COUNTRIES WHO LOST MILLIONS DEFENDING FREEDOM SUPPOSED TO PROVE A POINT ALLOWING THIS SICKNESS
.@SenTedCruz Failed to recognize? US & its Western & Arab allies have carried out 1,676 strikes so far & launched 4,775 munitions.
@esbecon This isn't the Gulf War. @SenTedCruz
@esbecon Obama's push for congressional authorization to use force against the Assad regime in Syria similarly went nowhere. @SenTedCruz
@prosediva @esbecon @SenTedCruz because nothing Obama has done in any venue inspires the slightest confidence his admin. wouldnt screw it up
@skeeter19592 thank you for your RW talking points. @esbecon @SenTedCruz
@prosediva @esbecon @SenTedCruz your wecome. I don't get any rw talking points.
How can u b sure his Admin has not recognized it? May be very aware of its infiltration and uncaring about the existentil threat
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz fans we have only 18 hours left to vote in this poll. RLC endorsement is on the line.
Which candidate most deserves our official endorsement for President? @RandPaul or @TedCruz? #RLC
@SenTedCruz After 7 years in office Slowbama has failed to do ANYTHING worth a crap, period...
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes So why is he droning them Mr. Cruz! He's not failing to recognize anything!
@Girlstar68106K @SenTedCruz @WashTimes  Hows that working?! He's released from Gitmo more ISIS leaders than he's removed on the battlefield.
@SenTedCruz fuck off
@SenTedCruz how about radical Christianity they killed 100 million native American in slaved millions of Africans bombed thousands for oil.
@SenTedCruz impeach Obama,, we can't afford another 12 months!

Schmuck!
@SenTedCruz Why are your birth records sealed ? Trying to keep up with Obama ?

Shouldn't you have a maple leaf as your logo Preacher Ted  ?
@SenTedCruz YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB! THANK YOU!
@SenTedCruz The Lord has had it with your using Him for Political gain. He is sending you back to Canada. Where is mom's birth certificate?
@SenTedCruz Lying is a sin! God's armor is shattering.Putting up a Rubio fantasy football ad that was a joke - pathetic & vile! God's angry!
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz These Conspiracy Theories have to stop Senator. It makes you VERY controlling and looking ridiculous.
@SenTedCruz Got to hate it when POTUS makes a liar out of you. FLAT OUT.
@SenTedCruz Just a tiny hint Teddy. Obama is NOT running for POTUS. And you shouldn't be either.
@WashTimes - "Grandpa Joe, why does @SenTedCruz say such idiotic things? Because Charlie, he's a #nitwit."
@SenTedCruz I will never understand President Obamas consistent denial of Muslim terrorist. I just hope we survive one more year of him
@SenTedCruz He just doesn't get it or really cares
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes the same way you ignore the white supremacist threat to America
@SenTedCruz  Dear Dumbfuck. Question: Who was April Glaspie?  I'll give you 10 minutes
@SenTedCruz Gun violence in America causes more deaths than terrorism. But then terrorists don't pay you to support their industry. NRA does
@Didikatz @SenTedCruz you haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. But you go girl chug that cool  aid.
@SenTedCruz  Dear Senator. I wish that Senator Term Limits, would have questioned then Senator Barry Soetoro,  on his #citizenship. #fraud.
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis That's because some in government seem to be members!
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis @WashTimes/ You know , with Republicans controlling both houses you & other Republicans let obama cause this mess.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes I SUPPORT WHAT YOU SAY 100 PERCENT. I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS HERE. MUST BE DEMOS
@SenTedCruz 18 months ago, you denounced your canadian citizenship. You are still a canadian
@SenTedCruz @WBVT_98FM  No they haven't RS
@SenTedCruz Obama will never throw his friends under the bus...just his white Grandma.
. @SenTedCruz 1yr after #CharlieHebdo state-sponsored provocateurs of murderous 'clash of civilizations' still at it http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/01/07/afff/ …
@SenTedCruz I don't believe it's that he doesn't see it. Hes a smart man. He fooled libs twice to vote for him. He knows just what's up.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes calls for the destruction israel.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes not radical anymore than saying Hamas is really peaceful even though their founding document
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes it is dishonest to insinuate that even when key document in Islam calls for the death of all disbelievers it is....
@SenTedCruz like a jackass, he wears blinders
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes  Islam is a threat to the world! The extremists are the one who follow it the same as Muhammad taught in the Quran.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes Sadly senator, you are guilty as well just not on his level. Islam is a threat to the world not "radical" Islam.
@SenTedCruz Rafael, hush, you are not a U.S. Citizen.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes That's because he's in the Muslim Botherhood, and a supporter of Islamic Terrorism.  #ImpeachObama
@SenTedCruz @MikkiL Nonsense. The Obama admin knows exactly what radical islam is about. On its own admission it is part of it.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes LOL!Sir, you sure draw a lot of mindless trolls!Ignorant sheeple slurping the Statist koolaid!You must scare them!LOL
@Blob_Fish @SenTedCruz Problem is OBozo was not born in America and he was raised by Communists in Nigeria!
@SenTedCruz  
Love reading Twitter posts of Cruz. There's not a single supporter in here. 

Its a liberal shlt-storm of hate. Screw this guy
@SenTedCruz  

EXISTENTIAL?

America's very existence is under threat By a group of dicks? Really?

Fear mongering is the GOP calling card
@SenTedCruz Intellectual dishonesty is awesome, right Rafael?
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes incompetency at its finest with this POTUS and Admin
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes forced indoctrination is the name of the game
@SenTedCruz  #CreepyCruz #SenPaisleyBathrobe #DominionistLoon
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes foolish to believe this being is anything but a cunning, malicious, deprecator of deception, denial, and death.
@SenTedCruz Very nice tweeting with you may God use you in a profound way this Great Nation needs a  True Leader Are You the One R seek else
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes @FoxNews : Why are these guys always left out?

@SenTedCruz beheadings, burnings displacement #Christains #Yazidi #Shia #gays #all infidels
@SenTedCruz Except for all the air strikes, but I guess in your mind the Air Force and Navy aren't important.
@SenTedCruz No he hasn't! The @POTUS just isn't willing to go in guns blazing. Contrary to your belief we are not the world police.
@SenTedCruz have you been asleep?
@SenTedCruz You have no idea what you're talking about!The mess & the reason for Isis was caused by YOUR HEARTLESS party!
@SenTedCruz I Tweet, Therefore I Am?
@SenTedCruz I think knows they're a threat
@SenTedCruz Sorry we don’t need a religious zealot starting a religious war with half the globe. Go back to Texas and play with your guns.
@SenTedCruz @WashTimes Or, about 225 +/- years after Radical Islamists first became a threat to the US.
@Colorado_Right @SenTedCruz @WashTimes just ignore the radicals and maybe they'll go away!
@SenTedCruz Your new logo looks like ALLAH in Islamic calligraphy.  Very Moroccan.
