 #LyingTed knows the money BELONGED to #Iran! Iran gave it to Reagan to buy weapons but that was ILLEGAL @StateDept @nypost
@nypost think about how much that could have helped veterans.

@mikesilva53089 @StateDept @nypost If anyone should be held accountable it is you @SenTedCruz for malpractice of representation!
@nypost water is wet . . .
@wivoutadoubt @StateDept @nypost @rlockrocks
A TRULY DISHONEST AND CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION  WHERE IS OUR CONGRESS??
accountable for smart negotiations? Anyone would use an outstanding payment for leverage in a deal.
@nypost would you rather that they have rotted in prison? I thought American lives were too valuable to you.
@nypost OBAMA IS A LIAR
Sounds more like the hostages were ransom they paid  us for something that belonged to them.
you need to support Trump
@nypost yes we must & we must hold you accountable for the pledge you made!
If someone called your spouse vile names, I think I’d understand you not endorsing.
@nypost I won't hold my breath for you to do that.
You've got it backwards, Ted.  Iran always asked for this money.  We demanded delivery of hostages to us as ransom.
@seanhannity @Reince Not a thing will be done, Bush will demand fealty to the Beast. The talkers will cave as usual.
LYING TED ,NUFF SAID .
@nypost these SOBs cant tell the truth and the dam msm covers for him and the clintons all the time. Call them out!
@nypost 
You're a rocket scientist. 
@StateDept #BoughtAndPaid4 
The corruption we experience is unconscionable!
@nypost yeah, I'm sure you'll get em THIS time!! None of you have any balls.
@nypost your all disgusting.
Ransom. and we don't do ransom???????????
@nypost  and we're surprised @BarackObama  lied Again!
@nypost but why are we giving the monies when they owe us 2 billion!! who's winning??? https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/former-iran-president-writes-to-obama-over-2b-court-ruling/2016/08/08/d137df80-5d51-11e6-84c1-6d27287896b5_story.html …
@nypost - Then hold them accountable!
@nypost You and Mike need to help DT get elected if you want to have a future in politics!
@nypost His administration has never been held accountable for anything else why would this be different?
@nypost Some needs to apologize to the Republicans.
@nypost How???  How can 'we' hold them accountable?  'We' haven't been able to give a single consequence.  YOU CAN!
That would be a first....holding them or anyone in this admin accountable.
@nypost And why is the media not holding Obama accountable for lying about it? @cnn @CNNPolitics @ABC @AP @NBCNews

@PoliticusSarah You say contingent and I say ransom. #tomato
@nypost What are you planning to do about this matter? You need to keep exposing them to the public!
@nypost And if Obama did nothing you would then complain he risked American lives. Cut the bullshit. #TexasDickHorn
@SenTedCruz @StateDept
He needs to be IMPEACHED yesterday.
America thanks you, @POTUS, for freeing 
Amir Hekmati, of Flint, MI... wrongly imprisoned in #Iran since 2011.
@nypost Makes me SICK!!!
Oh brother!
@nypost WAKE UP AMERICA
... Unfortunately, it won't matter. The corrupt progressives and the lame stream media will cover it up.
obama must be removed from office immediately!  Grow some balls Congress!!!
No one is willing to hold this disgraced president for all of his poor policies, but more importantly, never ending lying lies
@nypost @potus is a liar and a fool. #hrcRoleModel
@nypost good luck with that Ted.  There is no justice for highly placed democrat politicians. The country is lost.
@nypost all words and no action. Let us see them being held accountable.
And what are YOU going to do?  Talk or act?
.@SenTedCruz Except that's NOT what the @StateDept said, #LyinTed
I will campaign against you from now til doomsday!!
@nypost come on, Ted.  Obama can't use the term ransom in re this any more than he can use the words Islamic Terror
Cruz you probably don't understand what you read.
I thought you were smarter than Trump!
@nypost They said no such thing, nor was it a ransom
So will congress impeach him yet? I've only been asking for 7.5 years.
Using leverage is not a Ransom dumbass. But whatever.
You have got to be kidding.  Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.  @SenTedCruz @StateDept
@nypost Really?@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
Really. @SenTedCruz @StateDept @nypost @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
@nypost good call- Now, give me a break! Nothing's going to happen from the snakes head down! Zero! @seanhannity
