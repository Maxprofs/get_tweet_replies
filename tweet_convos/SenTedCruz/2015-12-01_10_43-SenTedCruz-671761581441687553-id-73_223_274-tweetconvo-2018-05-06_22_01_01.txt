@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis :this unarmed pro-Biafra activist was shot dead this morning by Nigeria forces,.
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis "terrorist refugee" non-existent - Christian terrorists abound in America. Let's get rid of them first.
@FacistLibberal @SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis there are multiple instances cited here:
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis thats it act like you are really doing something
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis Maybe Cruz and His family Should leave since  Cruz is the Son of immigrants
.@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis I applaud the act title for being more out of touch with reality than even your views on climate change
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis want to make Americans safe? Do something about gun control. Taking $$ from NRA - you have blood on your hands
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis We should send Americans to Canada to protect them mass shootings in the US. Gov has failed to protect.
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis Refugees should be denied to prevent them from getting killed by Americans w/ guns. Not even safe in grade school!
@SenTedCruz "When it comes to dictators, US should mind its own business." When it comes to women's health, mind UR own business, not ours.
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis Thanks Ted.
Every little bit of action helps. Bring the Visa program to a grinding halt while you're at it. @SenTedCruz @SweetFreedom29 @RepDeSantis
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis ;Great!! I pray that this goes through! Thank you RepDe Santis, and SenTedCruz!!
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis I am offended that you say most criminals are democrats, when did you poll them?
@sentedcruz @repdesantis You are very humane. Debase people fleeing violence, who've lost everything and paint them as "terrorists".
@blobert @SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis Just hearing your voice is a great way to get rid of terrorists and everyone else. You're a big joke
@SenTedCruz  I thank God that the Repubs finally have a fighter in Sen. Cruz. Just be careful going after fellow Repubs. Go after Dems.
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis  LYING TEA PARTY SCUM .
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis listen Cruz you really need to do us all a favor and save us some embarrassment and just shut up , ignorant ass
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis Because there's nothing more American than legislating racism and bigotry.

@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis people have always feared what they don't understand, you don't understand the refugee crisis. It's a shame.
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis The TRIP Act, did you pick that name? Refugees fleeing war & murder only to be abused by you. You are pathetic Ted.
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis hateful people deserve to be kept out of the country.  Send them back to Canada.
@Lotus7fan @SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis Unfortunately, Ted couldn't pass the Canadian immigration test - they actually test your sanity!
@SenTedCruz @RepDeSantis You are soft on domestic terror and hard on displaced women and children. I'm not buying what you're selling.
