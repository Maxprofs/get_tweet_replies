@bennergui another opportunity seized upon by haTED.. grandstanding. Look at his actions- not his words. Obama talked a good game, too.
so blind one of the few true constitutional conservatives left
then why does he want to rewrite the constitution?
term limits balance budget among other issues y is the Supreme Court rewriting the constitution
no. That will never happen. Cruz is not smarter than the founders. A rewrite is a Soros wet dream. Wake up, man.
article 5 is in the constitution exactly to protect us from abusive overreaching of the federal government listen to levin
levin took money from Soros. A constitutional conservative would NEVER change it. Good grief. How gullible are you?
really can you tell me because he finds Soros so vile
@SenTedCruz I need a cigarette after watching/listening to that. And I don't even smoke.  thank you Senator - and CR for posting.
omg. Cruz is another pathological liar. A danger to our constitution.  Please. For Gods sake, wake up.
You say once again with absolutely nothing to back that up.
who should I believe? @tedcruz or my eyes? Wake up. Cruz is a con. Prob another Soros robot.
You just don't stop do you?  
did u vote 4 Cruz? What if I am right?
@SenTedCruz Fantastic job sir!! Thank you! 
Ted is for Ted and globalism. America be damned. Wake up.
Those are allegations you can't back up.
@ted Cruz married to Goldman Sachs. Visited border w/beck to give teddies. Wants 2change Const
Well, you sure have all the bogus charges against Cruz down!  Congrats!  
they are not bogus at all. I was a witness to his treachery of the will of American people.
A job well done Senator Cruz!!!
@Hardline_Stance had heard of all these scandals but when @tedcruz listed them....wow.
yup I watched @SenTedCruz and he was outstanding! thank you Ted!
@tedcruz Great job Ted I loved it
@peddoc63 oh, @SenTedCruz @tedcruz How I love your mind. Thank you for your courage, sir, in representing both TX and the US. #Statesman
An absolute masterpiece of work by Cruz in this
what an amazing way to shame the democrats. Great job senator Cruz.  Me. Cruz for Supreme Court judge.
i'm very happy that Ted is being featured so much. Americans really need to get to know what this man is all about.
@tedcruz and yet there is nothing here about Cruz's hipocrasy.  Oh, that's right he has no faults does he?
.. Its Sessions hearing
and your point is what? My point is Cruz thinks he has no faults but point finger. Sold out to trump too.
@Hardline_Stance Bravo to @tedcruz!!
@tedcruz Thank you Sen Cruz!
He spent his time talking abt himself and rambling on as per usual.Anytime he speaks the entire audience is subjected to the Ted Cruz show
.."Rambling" ?  It was a masterful pieced together reason what the position of Atty gen is supposed to be
@SenTedCruz this is  why I love Ted Cruz! Outspoken clear ethical so smart! A great conservative!
Love to see you on the Supreme Court!
Right on Ted. Weve put up with a useless pres and cong long enough. Good riddance to obambam. God save the Trump!!!!!
WOW !! Very impressive!!!! So very, very true. Thank you, Sir. Carry on.
@SenTedCruz not really. But I like your passion
this was about Sessions NOT OBAMA this man is a racist but of course the Republicans wont admit it or because they are as well
@tedcruz If you missed this, watch it. Spectacularly put, inarguable. Needed to be done.
@SenTedCruz What a fabulous summation of facts. Hate to loose him as Senator but imagine him as a @SCOTUS Justice @realDonaldTrump.
@tedcruz great job sen Cruz!!amazingly done! The woman deigns u couldn't hold still. The truth is 2 hard 2 take for some!
sounds like Lyanna Mormonts speech from Game of Thrones for John Snow king of the North! Lmao
Cruz listed Many examples also!
@LyndaG1963 Good Job Cruz keep on KILLING IT WITH FIRE 
@america_trump @rgrant2243 Let's face it #Ted Cruz Destroy the democratic and needs to be nominated to the Supreme Court as a judge
Senator Cruz was a hero at Sessions hearing when he set the record straight w/ Al Franken who tried to destroy an honest man.
Thanks for defending Senator Sessions.  Great job.
@1VoiceMatters wow! Good fo Cruz! And it feels good that we are getting back on track with our justice system. The Trump Train track!

@SenTedCruz Thanks for Truthful Testimony, a Rare Virtue in D.C, on a GREAT PATRIOT, @SenatorSessions 
@Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump
Not smart for @KellyannePolls to Comment on Intel Story on Seth Myers Show NO ONE'S LAUGHING & MSM WAR on @realDonaldTrump IS ESCALATING!!
CAN'T KEEP TWEETING, INTERVIEWING THIS AWAY: FANNING FLAMES. Please, For Once, Say NO COMMENT. PERIOD. @seanhannity
NEITHER PRESIDENTS NOR THEIR SURROGATES SHOULD EVER COMMENT ON CLASSIFIED INTEL. PE Trump, Control Your Press @seanhannity
@SenTedCruz So proud of you today; respectful and direct. So glad you're my senator.
Cruz:His reprimands against Dems warrented! However,what about his own silence when unwarranted attacks against Trump? And his lies?
@tedcruz  you are a liar and you checked your integrity at the front door of trump Tower. Js
@tedcruz Read you had diarrhea of the mouth today while "questioning" Sen Sessions. Didn't get to talk enough earlier in the year?
no, Ted Cruz didn't.  tps://twitter.com/emmancipator/status/818864231055388672
Thank you Ted Cruz for your eloquent speech. You have my respect now.
@tedcruz you killed it!!!! Great job.
@tedcruz where was your fake outrage when DT called you nd your wife names? Get real.
Cruz's pointing his finger at camera& blistering threatening to Trump didn't happen? Amazing..

@SenTedCruz  you rock!
We listened to every word and appreciated all that was done and said today. Thank you for moving forward and being clear, @SenTedCruz. @CR
I'll admit Cruz did a great job on the Sessions hearing, but still don't trust him. Gained some weight, hasn't he? 
#Jan20 #MAGA
Dems use of atty gen office. partial. when position is to follow law. Was Cruz's point
@tedcruz Wonderful job Senator Cruz.
@tedcruz what does this have to do with confirmation hearing? Cruz just likes the sound of his own voice. No respect for a sell out!
Defining actual role of atty general in this country. Granted most of country does not want to hear that
When someone blatantly disrespects your family you don't support them no matter what! Cruz=sell out.
I didn't like u much last yr but today u were a star! Thank you so much! I am now a fan. Keep giving those dems a shellacking!
@tedcruz well said!!
@tedcruz You put the HA in hack.
the only thing that could put out that fire is some golden showers
I love Jeff Sessions but WHY in the hell didn't YOU all have them ALL arrested? Impeached or stop them? #TREASON 
the only thing that would have made that better if they panned to the other members of the committee as @tedcruz  talked
@SenTedCruz What a beat down on the Dems. Well done Sen Cruz..
Need some water for that burn @alfranken? @tedcruz Cut the democrats off at the knees & slashed the jugular.
@tedcruz it's ok to raise the debt to 29 trillion to repeal Obamacare, over ten years , what a hypocrite
@tedcruz This was amazing!  Thank you for TRUTH.
@SenTedCruz wow you go ted cruz
@tedcruz amazing job today!  Cruz for Supreme Court
When dems wanted to question whether @SenatorSessions would uphold the law & Constitution it was important to point out Obama's lawless.
@tedcruz he could also have peed on it but PEOTUS beat him to that too
AWESOME VIDEO!  
go Ted.  Thank you for standing up!!!   2nd Supreme Court nomination!
@tedcruz great job!
@tedcruz wow..what an indictment on the "Democrats....senator Cruz has style and puts a nail in it!   Democrats and Hypocrisy same ...
Ted Cruz killed it today!  The man speaks the truth and does it very well!
@tedcruz ted should be our president.
@tedcruz That was truthful, elequent, and much needed in the face of such hypocrisy
@SenTedCruz Home run hit of the truth today!
@tedcruz Good job by Ted.
@tedcruz http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/09/jeff-sessions-wanted-to-drop-the-case-against-kkk-lynching-attorney-testified.html â€¦
He didn't kill anything other than the Hearing Confirmation Process. Not the time or place. The hypocrisy was his own.
Cruz's point is atty general's position is to follow law .. not partial witch hunts like Dem's have made office
Thank you for your service!
Go get'em Ted. #MAGA
Wow, just started following you after watching your testimony during Sessoms hearing today. you are truly brilliant and a patriot!!
@tedcruz conservative review, doesn't sound like a biased hate spewing site riddled with fraudulent "news ". A credible source indeed!
PLEASE hang in Sen. Confirm. debate chamber a larger-than-life face shot of Sen. Robt Byrd in Klan Sheet! ONLY KKK MEM IN CONG!
Cruz schooled the entire committee on the etiquette of / rule of law that BO pillaged.  Cruz is a class act. @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump
@tedcruz Cruz is a jerk!
Thumbs up 4 @tedcruz 4 his cool calm reaction to the lunatics interrupting him! (just like the primary debates) @ @SenatorSessions hearing 
Good stuff @CR @tedcruz

Dems are scared stiff about the Rs upholding the law.
