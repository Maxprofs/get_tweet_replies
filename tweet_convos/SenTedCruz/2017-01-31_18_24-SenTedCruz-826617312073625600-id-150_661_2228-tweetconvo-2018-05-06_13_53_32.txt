@SenateGOP kiss a little harder gotta do something to makeup for that campaign talk
You really think many of us care about your "whole hearted endorsement" with your history? You should think again.
Yes but HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE BAN and why is your office hanging up on people? YOUR Texas people?
@SenateGOP @POTUS he degraded ur wife party first not family
this endorsement means a lot coming from an Constituitional Conservative such as yourself.
@SenateGOP Please vote NO to DeVos- our children deserve better and a more qualified leader
We're watching you= women are the future
Well of course you do your a bigot and an elitist like he is!
ur a sell out Ted, a sell out
Of course you do, dear. Hope he gets the same treatment as Merrick Garland. Remember him? Of course you do, dear.
I thought the rule was that the next President gets to pick? #MerrickGarland
Impossible. You don't have a heart. Or a brain. Or courage.
Me, too!
Watch Out Triggly Puffs & Beta's are out in full force.
^5 Judge Gorsuch..now re: De Vos..it maybe time to cut her loose...watched hearing..she was ill prepared..
@SenateGOP @POTUS Oh Teddy you have to spine...and Merrick Garland
@SenateGOP @POTUS why would we listen to you when you called trump a snivelling coward then worked the phones for him?
@SenateGOP  Do Not vote G in!! That is not the best choice for the USA!!!
haven't you realized theodore that you are now irrelevant? Never gonna be Prez Dominionist.
Can Trump use the Nuclear Option for all of the remainder of our cabinet picks?
@SenateGOP @POTUS You have weak morals and a weaker spine

What-no bedtime stories?
that's the best picture you could come up with??? #photographyclass
oh Ted can't wait to watch @BernieSanders take the remains of your soul at next weeks debate
@SenateGOP @POTUS None cares what you think Ted.
High Five Senator Cruz!!!
AMEN! God Bless our new President @realDonaldTrump , his team, cabinet and @SenateGOP ! WE NEED UNITY, THANKS!
I didn't see that coming!
@SenateGOP @POTUS  Did Rebekah Mercer approve of pick?  She must be telling Trump to have you Nuke the nominee.
@SenateGOP @POTUS remember when Donny attacked your woman wife's physical appearance?
@SenateGOP @POTUS 

Would of Luv to have seen you on that bench, 
But hey we need you in Texas! 

DON'T MESS WITH TED'S TEXAS
Smart choice, President Trump is brilliant.
I will wholeheartedly applaud when you are voted out of Office. Only reason you're in you fixed election time
.@SenTedCruz @SenateGOP  We don't.   NO Nuclear Option! #Shameless
Thank you #lyinTed you're the #Canadian government appreciates you and all you do for us everyday  
@SenateGOP @POTUS Really? We already knew you are against #EqualRights like him.
FU @sentedcruz @potus @senategop
He is not potus.  He is illegitimate.  Therefore, his picks are illegitimate @realdonaldtrump only
@SenateGOP @POTUS and if obama had nominated him you'd wholeheartedly reject him
big surprise there. Teddy falls in line with Donny. Can wait to see all of the women and minority hating you come up with
I do not like him on a boat I do not like him for a vote
That's good enough for me! #SCOTUS
I think we the democrats will wait 4 years to approve. That is what was suggested if HRC won.
A crazy judge who wants to follow the constitution. What the hell will President Trump do next? #MAGA
hey Ted thought you wanted this seat open for 4 years ?  No spine fascist
@Maxinerunner @POTUS But when asked by @TuckerCarlson you never answered if you would have selected him had you become President
Is it because you both think people who are not straight and male are beneath you? #LGBTRights #WomensMarch #TedCruz
You certainly would. I will enjoy unelecting you.
#ThankYouTrump for the great @scotus pick!
Agreed
293 days without even a hearing. Pathetic.
great pick, but wish it would've been you @tedcruz 
resign
@USATopGuns @POTUS I wholeheartedly second that#Maga #SupremeCourt Great job Mr. President 
He is no friend to women. He has ruled as you would in women's reproductive rights. Do not support his confirmation.
Watch Dems do everything possible to delay his nomination just as you did theirs . Karma
who urged @GOP to hold the Scalia seat open for ADDITIONAL 4 years if HRC won, isn't in the best position to lecture Ds now.
man after Trump ripped you apart...
you're a joke.... @realDonaldTrump has been right about almost nothing, except for his opinions on you.
This endorsement brought to you I am Sam, Sam I am.
Message from one of your constituents here, in Austin: I AM SO VOTING YOU OUT NEXT TERM! 
#PresidentBannon Cruz has no spine. Be a man!!!!
And this taxpayer does not.
So are you just lining your pockets with dirty money or does Trump tell you what to say as he rubs his nipples?
AGREE!  And all nominees are GREAT   EXCEPT 1 @BetsyDeVos   Texas kids = all kids need u 2 vote NO @AliceLinahan
Merrick Garland
