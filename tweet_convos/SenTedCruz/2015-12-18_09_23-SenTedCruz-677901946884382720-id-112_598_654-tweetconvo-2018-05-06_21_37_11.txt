@SenTedCruz   The spending bill is a disgrace and we need a complete change in GOP leadership. Resign McConnell !
@SenTedCruz Anyone who thinks a bill that didn't fund these programs would get passed is fooling themselves. Dems never let that happen
@SenTedCruz No duh!
@SenTedCruz @MalcusD I feel my vote was WASTED when I voted to give the Repubs. a majority.
@SenTedCruz It gives Tax Breaks to Corporations and that is a GOP victory, but not a victory for the Working Middle Class. #FeelTheBern

@SenTedCruz @marcorubio 
It's almost as if they're mocking and daring the people. #Congress
@SenTedCruz As well provide them a revisit to the OATH they swore when elected..
@SenTedCruz They have NO PRINCIPLES OR VALUES.
@SenTedCruz Then all who vote in favor need to be relieved of duty when the time to be re-elected comes about.
@SenTedCruz you are the only candidate that does what they said they would do. I'll support you come hell or high water.
@SenTedCruz so why didn't you stop it.
@SenTedCruz 
Any wonder why there is such distrust of politicians?
Glad I have Christ to have hope in.
@SenTedCruz   I feel like the horse looking at the pigs and humans at the end of Animal Farm.

@SenTedCruz @LoriBlaney It's a great way to make yourselves extinct
@SenTedCruz   And the GOP elites wonder why we do not trust them any longer.
@SenTedCruz this is one reason why people have lost confidence in the republican party
@SenTedCruz You are all shams! You knew it would pass. The only question was who could vote yes & still save their jobs. We're run by corps
@SenTedCruz thanks for making the vote
@SenTedCruz it is why congress has such a low approval rating.we need a new party and we need to have publicly financed elections.#3rdparty
@SenTedCruz: This 2,000+ page spending bill does not honor the promises we made to the men and women who elected us. http://1.usa.gov/1mrTDVM 
@SenTedCruz Call out McConnell and the leadership of both houses for failing to do what they were elected to do. This has to stop.
@SenTedCruz @RepAnnWagner @RoyBlunt Missouri is shaking their head today.  What are Republicans doing?
@SenTedCruz You got that right Ted! The House & Senate turned their backs on the American people.
@SenTedCruz Nothing you elected officials have done supports "we the people". That will be proved again in 2016 if America lasts that long.
@SenTedCruz Thats right you and your party have failed again. DO WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
@SenTedCruz Make sure you point out Rubio saying he would stop it and then not showing to vote at the next debate. Do not let up on him.
@popup82 @jimdwrench @SenTedCruz this is why I don't think I'll  consider anyone in Congress for pres...a cesspool of political hacks
@SenTedCruz You made it in to vote?...and Rubio couldn't?? Thank you Ted!
@SenTedCruz You need to STOP BEING NICE open up on Rubio about his lies and that he doesnt vote. Get off script and MAD TED!!
@SenTedCruz Romney was too nice too ya know... and he LOST bc of it
@SenTedCruz And it does not honor the men and women who fight for us either. It is a sad day with Christmas on the horizon! @SpeakerRyan
@SenTedCruz keep ringing the bell of freedom, senator.  We need to see who supported passing this "swill"!
@SenTedCruz Maybe that's why making promises when you're not a king and can't do whatever you want is a bad idea
@SenTedCruz thank you for standing on principle Senator #TedCruz2016
@SenTedCruz NO! Really?
