@SenTedCruz says the illegal immigrant senator from Texas. No wonder you are open borders you need to cover your own ass.
@SoMuchBlah @SenTedCruz Only Trump is for illegal immigration. Get educated!
@ErinRehman Good News @SenTedCruz qualifies for DACA since he was brought to the US illegally as a minor by his mother. Irony right?
@TexasYankee001 @MamaBear4Cruz @mrsdannyh birther alert@SoMuchBlah
@ErinRehman Cruz birth cert is from Canada. How is that birther? @TexasYankee001 @MamaBear4Cruz @mrsdannyh
@SoMuchBlah @TexasYankee001 @MamaBear4Cruz @mrsdannyh your point?
@ErinRehman How did cruz mother get SS# for with no birth certificate? You guessed it filling out a naturalization form. #NotNaturalBorn
@SoMuchBlah his mom is a US citizen and therefore so is he! @TexasYankee001 @MamaBear4Cruz @mrsdannyh
@SenTedCruz @infooverload 
That would escalate a minor problem and risk damage to Taiwan's economy

Stick to what you know
Avoid ignorance
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz So you would just accept any foreign carrier group into a US port?

@SenTedCruz @BWaiC A bit late now to come up with (cribbed) good ideas, Ted. Go back to your god-bothering.
Sending the carrier to the ROC would get Beijing's attention.

@SenTedCruz You say you will have a flat tax. Have you thought about no tax for people over 70 that make less than $100.000a year?
@SenTedCruz the country we don't acknowledge is a legit country because China thinks it still owes it? Sure...
@SenTedCruz will you also push the UN to recognize Taiwan as a legitimate country ?
@SenTedCruz at this pt that would only spped up China invasion to Taiwan--that they have promised...
@SenTedCruz nice try. US is not partner to any country.
@SenTedCruz I really hope our next president will have the courage to truly confront the PRC and strengthened our pacific allies
@SenTedCruz ur not in DC so don't take pay!!
@SenTedCruz How the fuck do you know. You don't sit on any military committees and you didn't serve and u are a jr. senator.
@SenTedCruz 中美之间又不是没有打过，结果大家都知道，所以个别西洋政治小丑狗吠之前最好先好好学学历史～
@SenTedCruz Taiwan is one China

@SenTedCruz #TrusTed #NoDonOfCon!
@SenTedCruz Now.Chinese people all hate you because goverment
@SenTedCruz As a Hong Konger ,I thinks it's time the USA review the terms of United States–Hong Kong Policy Act, or even abolish it.
@SenTedCruz let me guess we're going to war with China?
@SenTedCruz if Cruz does not win in Indiana and refuses to suspend his campaign we then know he is not presidential material. A Texan here!
@SenTedCruz GET OUT OK?
@SenTedCruz You are always welcome to TAIWAN. We will always be your friends.
@imrobinlo @SenTedCruz The one on the left is one beautiful man.
@SenTedCruz Oh Ted, this isn't the first time it's happened, and it's likely due to nonstop GOP aggression shown on every US media source.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump  @BernieSanders Mr. Myagi:use greater force against itself.We should be building islands next to theirs, simple
@SenTedCruz  Congratulation, you successfully makes that Chinese and Russian become a military alliance.
@SenTedCruz sb 美国白狗

@Taiwan1107 shit
@SenTedCruz Welcome to Taiwan!
@SenTedCruz Ecactly
@SenTedCruz shame on you!
@LGeoghagan I live there. It isn't. 
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Unfortunate, but Hong Kong is a part of China's Sovereign State.
@SenTedCruz 我是台灣人 歡迎來台灣~
I am Taiwanese.  Welcome  to Taiwan~
@SenTedCruz The Red Chinese probably mistook it for a militarized American-made island.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz here is what you need to learn from Trump. He wants to get along with China, but you just want to start a fight.
@SenTedCruz I don't think Chinese will get mad if they are denied port visit in Hawaii.
@SenTedCruz I AM TAIWANESE I think you can group up TAIWAN and AMERICA's relationship
@SenTedCruz I am TAIWANESE,I think you can group up TAIWAN and AMERICA's relationship
@SenTedCruz Couldn't have said it better! That tweet is now on my @RebelMouse  http://rbl.ms/1rGtSEb 
@SenTedCruz - Agreed.  Let's leverage Taiwan & tell China we don't appreciate their Hong Kong Phoeey!
@SenTedCruz They probably don't trust us to be that close and you really can't blame them for that.
@SenTedCruz Don't wade into deep water, Ted.  International affairs are best left to adults, not debate team losers.   @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz thanks to Prez Obama.
@SenTedCruz @TexansTrump @realDonaldTrump ALERT wake up Cruz! Where have you been all along. Get on the Trump Train!!!
@SenTedCruz why did you ever think red China was our "partner" are you that out of touch
@SenTedCruz Taipei and her people are as good a friends as the USA has in the region.  To bad we don't act like it.
@SenTedCruz Not Good!!
@SenTedCruz warnings abound everywhere. Thanks for letting us know.
@SenTedCruz China is a plague amongst the world. If there is going to be depopulation, begin there!
@SenTedCruz Proof that your rhetoric is toxic @SenTedCruz. As a young airman Hing Kong was allowed to CVN 65. Perhaps it's u @SenTedCruz.
@SenTedCruz should have been Hong Kong.
@SenTedCruz Its always THEM AND US with you. I'm sick of your posturing. CRETIN. #nevercruz
@SenTedCruz THATS NOT GOOD
@SenTedCruz @NeverTrump Expect much more of this rejection w/Trump as POTUS but in moderate nations #DictatorApprentice
@SenTedCruz clueless reactionary
@SenTedCruz PRC feels powerful next to BHO. One projects strenght over one who projects weakness. POTUS has compromised USA around the WORLD
@SenTedCruz Honorable Senador Ted Cruz: May the Lord bless you and use you for His glory. Your credentials are extraordinary! We love you!
@SenTedCruz Let's do it!
@SenTedCruz YOU MAKING PEOPLE LOOK LIKE FOOLS,YOU SAY TRUMP RAN OVER A MEXICAN AND EVERYONE RUNS OUT TO SEE, AND THERE THEY ARE FOOLS.
@SenTedCruz you needed proof that PRC isn't a US partner? Did Obama say we were partners with PRC and u wanted to make an issue for nothing?
@SenTedCruz do it and send off a few shoots
@SenTedCruz Lord @realDonaldTrump definitely beats you.
@SenTedCruz. WE NEED YOU AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
@SenTedCruz  maybe they're just looking for better rate of return on our debt?
@SenTedCruz leave these matted to our president
@SenTedCruz Not that simple, not the first time. How would you respond if a PRC warship wanted to dock at San Diego?
