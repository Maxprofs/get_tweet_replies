I've worked with refugees. Have you even met a refugee?

Pathetic.
Then, why don't you go work with them? Elsewhere.

@GovAbbott @tedcruz
Because this is my country. You don't own patriotism.
But not your country EXCLUSIVELY
It isn't very patriotic to call 
@GovAbbott & @tedcruz #Pathetic 4 protecting constituents
You are more likely to get shot by someone you know. Look it up.
I can't talk to someone who spews nonsense 1) No one mentioned guns
2) I never said I "owned" patriotism

@tedcruz God Bless TEXAS 
You have bigger issues to tend to leave these people alone
this is starting to come to the surface http://www.kalb.com/content/news/TX-Governor-Gregg-Abbott-denies-politics-382173741.html …
. If he had been able to put a SCOTUS in place? Different ending.
we will believe you when you stop #feded; where is your courage on saving the academic education of our kids, #Governor?
Yeee haw!!!!   Texas knows the truth that is why.
Do you have a better plan or even a plan at all?
@tedcruz I wish Utah's @GovHerbert would follow suit...Rose Park is no longer recognizable...like traveling to another country.
@YouTube @GOP @HOTMAIL.COM @realdonaldtrump
@SenTedCruz. I agree with the governor. Keep these people out of our country.
@SenTedCruz @YouTube Good, the government can't afford to support more people. Specially people that dont share our values.
because Texas has lost what made it great. And it continues with you.
CAUSE MOST TEXAN POLITICIANS ARE FULL OF HORSESHIT & CRUZ ON TOP OF LIST! 
@tedcruz @YouTube Hallelijah!  We have to stop these unvettee refugees from entering our country
@tedcruz @YouTube Our right to vote is our most powerful weapon. It needs to be protected through voter ID!
@tedcruz @YouTube Here is to all of the GOP ASSHOLES IN GOVERNMENT!
- I hope it's contagious Gov. Abbott!!
@tedcruz Ted waiting on your all important take Donny Cuba. Stand up for right!
I thought the US conquered Texas and deposed @GovAbbott and @tedcruz 
@YouTube
@tedcruz It's like buying a car #AsIs, you're forced to take your chances. Need 2 prove citizenship for a passport, Y not 2 vote?
@tedcruz quite frankly I'm not surprised you guys down in the Lone Star State live like a third world country.
@tedcruz good to hear. We need this kind of stance in WA state.
because they Islamophobic bigots.
Thank you Governor for hearing the American citizens.  You are leading.  I hope more states follow.
@tedcruz @YouTube who cares what Texas does
@tedcruz @YouTube Good for you Governor.  Wish I lived in Texas.
@tedcruz We all should! It's uncalled for. Hillary and Obama are giving Citizenship at alarming rates with a voter card? Fishy?
@SenTedCruz this makes sense!!! God bless our beautiful state!!
I BET I KNOW WHO WHISPERED IN HIS EAR.....
heard the Fed is doing it no matter what...
@laurafut_laura
I Want to move there. Can you recommend a good job?
@SenTedCruz Is it possible to send the ones in TX back? Training camps? WH said sending anyway! How?
@SenTedCruz @YouTube Because you're a collection of assholes?
@SenTedCruz @YouTube Governor Abbott, you are the best governor in America and N. Carolina has the next best. Stay conservative
@SenTedCruz @YouTube Because they are smart and realize the threat that it poses to this country.
@YouTube thank you Greg Abbott
wonderful news! Let's stop all immigration until we can defend our borders and vet who comes into our great State!
hallelujah. 99% Sunni ....from areas that are at least 10% Christians
@YouTube Tx GOP; proud bigots poking Lady Liberty in the eye!  I salute ur anti-Americanism
@YouTube You are not stopping anyone from coming just not being conduit of fed money. You are deplorable and a panderer.
@YouTube Keep fighting 4 us Governor.
@YouTube -Thank you for watching out for Texas children
@YouTube This is why I voted for you Governor...your a Patriot!
the only way foxnews gets a hit from me is if your or Louie Gohmert post a link. Well done, Sir. Thank You.
Refugees will still be relocated to TX.  Nothing has changed.  Dishonest.
I think I need to move to Texas!!!
tea party friends pointed out that this just removed Texas from oversight. We're not impressed.
How quickly we forget...
guess it worked in that day and age.  There wasn't terrorism to deal with then.

@YouTube Liberals  r dictating their compassion 4 immigrants only to use Tx has their dumping ground
good that you are just laying your bigotry right out there
-This should get those few Leftist radical 2move out of our, "country"Texas
Illegal voters needed in the NE,
Beware Interpol and their unconstitutionally Obama granted authorities and immunities! http://bit.ly/2cRfDrI 
@YouTube TY Governor! Send them to the Blue States.  Vermont,  New Hampshire, Connecticut didn't receive any.
.@GovAbbott #ThoughtLeadership
@YouTube #Texit! Let our voices be heard and considered!
