@DorothyKulik @SenTedCruz How can u make such a ridiculously silly statement?He IS Natural Born.Do a little reading.Learn something useful.
@DorothyKulik @SenTedCruz He has argued our laws his entire career.Read the law.U assume too much.He's American born.U must b a Trumpette!
Yet not one of them can say when exactly Cruz became an American. :) @dixie_pudding @DorothyKulik @SenTedCruz
@TFinn82 @DorothyKulik @SenTedCruz From the day of his birth,Cruz was an American.Why is this law so difficult for Trumpsters to comprehend?
@dixie_pudding @dhiggins63 @TFinn82 @DorothyKulik (11) I know about this b/c our 4th child was born outside of the USA too.
@VermillionRich @dixie_pudding @TFinn82 @DorothyKulik Even so, by statute, your 4th child was an American citizen at birth, like Cruz!
@SenTedCruz Your hypocrisy and lies eats me up!
@March_for_Life Support WIC, CHIP, 4 children already born. March 4 them.

@SenTedCruz is it your love of "life" that leads you to want to strip tens of millions of Americans of their health care?
Thank you @SenTedCruz for defending life. @March_for_Life
