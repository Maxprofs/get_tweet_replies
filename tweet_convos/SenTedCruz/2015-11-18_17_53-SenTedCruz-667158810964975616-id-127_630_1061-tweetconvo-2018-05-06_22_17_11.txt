@SenTedCruz I'm worried more about US lack of gun control and our only crazy folks gunning down citizens, but you'd have to stand up to NRA
@SenTedCruz If you are truly concerned about the safety of Americans then you would address gun violence in this country.
@RSeanStewart there are numerous elaborate laws right now on the books, background checks, we have a spiritual problem not a gun problem
@1Oyster1 Are you saying that all countries with lower levels of gun violence are more "spiritual" than US? How is that measured?
@RSeanStewart look at firearm deaths/100K population, as progressives legislate antigun laws deaths tend to increase
@1Oyster1 I appreciate that you see a correlation, but I don't believe that proves causation. I support the 2nd Amend as written by Founders
@SenTedCruz @freedomtex Stop them at all Texas borders, whatever it takes, whatever
@SenTedCruz @Sassafras_Knob Did I miss something or had the Government already dropped off a boat load in LA?  And lost track of them since.
@SenTedCruz IF you fear God,you will acknowledge the "mistake" Iraq war created ISIS.Now you refuse refugee from enemy USA created???
@SenTedCruz please stop talking.  Please.
@SenTedCruz @annepaezNOLA Most of your colleagues are unprincipled cowards with no honor. Thank you for leading. God bless us.
@SenTedCruz Can you try to talk sense into @SenBobCasey ?  He and @GovernorTomWolf  are getting ready to destroy my state of PA
@SenTedCruz Dear Mr. Cruz, I would like to take you up on your offer for debate. Let's let the President doe more important jobs.
@SenTedCruz um jihadis wear suits and have WH security now
@SenTedCruz you got my vote!
@Robbie_G88 @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @AngieDrue read in the news that weasel Reid already looking to block!
@SenTedCruz @Magilla7 Slipping .... Ah ... it's none.
@SenTedCruz guess who wants you to hate and turn away refugees. That's right, ISIS! You're literally helping promote the cause of the enemy.
@SenTedCruz    Shut up.
@SenTedCruz Try addressing the real causes of extremism both here & abroad.
@SenTedCruz promise me no sicko quill shoot up another one of our kids schools, and I'll concede we need to start religious profiling
@SenTedCruz Michelle Malkin calls them "refugeehadis".
@SenTedCruz Only solution to Jihad vermin? Crush our Muslim African Prez, go with a REAL American like Ted, then crush & flush Jihad vermin.
@SenTedCruz These people are fleeing a enemy your party (white-racist party) created to steal OIL from the "dirty/heathen" Muslims.FACT.
@SenTedCruz Point #2, IF you claim to be a Christian, how do you feel about killing 1M Muslims for OIL &creating ISIS, in "mistake" war?
@SenTedCruz @TweetsLucinda ....thank you sir! Praying for you & your family...you have God's anointing to be a great leader...
@SenTedCruz its a lovely thing the congress tried to do a couple years back but didn't. Impeach him and try him for treason.
@SenTedCruz, post numbers for people to contact their congressmen and demand they support bill to stop Obama Syrian refugees entering.
@SenTedCruz I'm sure a few are already here Teddie.
@SenTedCruz I fervently #StandwithRand but I respected you highly as my 2nd choice, you lied on #NSA & @RandPaul now your integrity is gone.
@SenTedCruz @freedomtex You always work ur ass off and I believe you love this country.Now you must fight harder to help keep my family safe
@SenTedCruz ONE OF THEM DISAPPEARED IN LOUISIANA ALREADY.
@SenTedCruz @tarafdavis What about what's "slipping" in HOMESCHOOLS?! RT @HogeAnita @gen_yvette
@SenTedCruz You are so right, Senator Cruz.  I pray that you win the election. Our country needs you.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz but you don't want to do anything to protect the people already here from all the gun violence within. How do you people think?
@SenTedCruz Stringent Homeland Security measures during vetting is the answer, as well as same right here at home.
@SenTedCruz Hmmm, did u stop  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev & Tamerlan Tsarnaev from "slipping in our country"??? We have homegrown terrorists, IDIOT !
@SenTedCruz If Obama was really compassionate and really cared about Americans safety as well,he wld form safe zone in Syria for #refugees
@SenTedCruz 2011 OBAMA Stopped Processing Iraqi Refugee Requests: Security Concerns Why won't he stop Syrians now? http://bit.ly/1kFEI9S 
.@SenTedCruz If @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems vote against common sense, any US citizen falling to terrorism will be THEIR fault
@MidAmericanGuy And they will care less.
@SenTedCruz you can't block refugees. ..genius
@SenTedCruz Your are not a US citizen. Produce your Mother Birth certificate.

@SenTedCruz "give me your tired, give me your poor." Guess they don't make your cut if they're being murdered eh?
@SenTedCruz And if that comes at the cost of millions of Syrian refugee children dying, so be it. #Freedom #JustLikeJesus #HomeOfTheBrave
@SenTedCruz @KazmierskiR I thought you were a Christian, a Canadian but Christian, guess not
@SenTedCruz  @GOP senators should have stood up to Obama #ImpeachObama
@SenTedCruz I still prefer Radical Islamic extremists...as jihadis is the preferred term used by Killary.
@SenTedCruz @Texas4Cruz Trump is fully in. #Trump2016 @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz #Bigot
@SenTedCruz #NoMuslimRefugees
@SenTedCruz @RitaMMiller24 Well said on tonight's Mark Levin Show!
@SenTedCruz GOOD FOR YOU!  ColoGov welcomes all refugees? If 76,000 Bronco game watchers in MileHighStadium are attacked what you say then?
@SenTedCruz One thing you can do is push for impeachment.  He has skirted every law on the books
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz "We must do everything we can to prevent even a few communists from slipping into our nation."This would have kept your dad out.
@SenTedCruz Our country is a terrorist playground. We have tall buildings, tunnels , nuclear power plants ,military bases.
@SenTedCruz I have a bowl of 10000 m&ms 10 are poisoned.  How many are you going to eat?
@SenTedCruz The VIRGINIA Governor doesn't care about the risk to Virginia voters. The President does not care. Syrians equal terrorist.
@SenTedCruz I'm urging you to shut the hell up and drop out already.
@SenTedCruz the argument about refugees will be lost if it's about jihad. It needs to be about cost and helping our own especially veterans
@SenTedCruz Is it your cowardice that bests your willful ignorance, or your willful ignorance that bests your cowardice? It's a tough call.
@MuthrBear @SenTedCruz "Corwardice" "Ignorance" r those fail to protect Americans & support terrorists.
AMEN BRO @SenTedCruz #GrassrootsRising #ShieldsUP #DefeatISIS
@bakerlarry84 @SenTedCruz Amen? --Satan feeds cowardice ..don't be sacrilegious as well.God save America from her enemies without & within
@SenTedCruz VIRGINIA LIVES MATTER.pound this into anyone with authorities head.
@SenTedCruz you are so transparent it's embarrassing to watch. Also, why do you hate Mexicans so much?
@SenTedCruz One terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant will have Chernobyl results on the East coast.
@SenTedCruz Thank God we have people like you and @realDonaldTrump on our side! Don't let us down!
@SenTedCruz they are already here, stop dishing out fear and cowardice against the refugees the US created starting in the 90s
@SenTedCruz thx, simple leadership, but unfortunately, the current administration chooses not to do it effectively.
@SenTedCruz Says the featured speaker at Kevin Swanson's Kill the Gays Rally - FU @SteveDeaceShow
@SenTedCruz Syrian refugees infected with ISIS invited to Virginia. Will have 2 nuclear power plants, Naval base and military bases
@SenTedCruz I'm glad you're finally listening to @RandPaul . He really does have the ideas to move the nation beyond this terrorist regime
@SenTedCruz which nation? your native Canada or the US? No more foreigners in the White House. @realDonaldTrump a true American.#Trump2016
@SenTedCruz You act like terrorists are just entering this country.   You are shameful.
@SenTedCruz it's really simple, close the border. However it's clear our government was overthrown And nobody will be honest about it
@SenTedCruz Well, post Paris showboating isn't going to solve that issue. jihadis can be radicalized here. @FiestaBuckeye

@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz so you're going to self deport?
@SenTedCruz they're already amongst US
We must take Prudent Steps to soften the blow~ until we have a POTUS that will Counterpunch at last
@sentedcruz 1 Allow terrorists en masse into country 2 Terrorists attack 3 Argue for more surveillance
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz If you give into terror, then you are letting #ISIS win. Compassion over fear. #SyrianRefugees #defeatfear
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz I agree with you!
@SenTedCruz If Obama brings in Refugees and even ONE kills Americans - Do you think he should  RESIGN?
@SenTedCruz it's been reported that some are already in PA?
@SenTedCruz If only 0.19% of 10,000 are jihadists, that would equal how many pulled off the 9/11 attacks. #RefugeeRoulette
@LehmonBaxley Yet those terrorists came here legally. Chattanooga was attacked by a homegrown terrorist. Blaming #refugees only spreads fear
@FreedomVSFear Fear is mere emotion. I am talking about facts. They can't vet people who buy "real" Syrian passports with fictitious names.
@LehmonBaxley Terrorists can also buy a fake British passport. Shall we just stop all travel to the US? Shall we let 10000 people die?
@FreedomVSFear Re-Read. They are buying REAL passports, from Syrian Government agents. Fake passports usually do not make it past TSA.
@LehmonBaxley Then it seems our only option is to give into terror. America will let France help the tired, the poor, the huddled masses...
@FreedomVSFear No, we fight it, and do not invite it in.
@LehmonBaxley Terrorism is an idea. This is a war of hearts and minds. The only way to fight an idea is with an idea.
@SenTedCruz  Stop terrorists AND let the refugees in.
@SenTedCruz the home grown terrorists and religious nuts aren't from Syria Mr. Time for you to return to senate for the job you're paid for
@SenTedCruz Another GOP who benefited from a program who would deny it to others.
@SenTedCruz And if they don't are you going to read Cat & The Hat to us again? Or was it Green Eggs and Ham?
@SenTedCruz A men!  Thank you for your toughness in that interview today calling out Obama. We need strength, decisiveness, and leadership
@SenTedCruz
CANADIAN BACON EBENEZER CRUZ I agree immigration has risks. I point to you as an example. A CANADIAN with CUBAN Sperm Doner.
@SenTedCruz
The question I frequently ask is, what if U had immigrated from Mexico? I doubt the @GOP or Texas would have U. Ivy League snob.
@SenTedCruz time to impeach. Why did he tip off Isis before he bombed the oil trucks?
@SenTedCruz I'm starting a "go fund me" page, to buy a tiny island for you to go live on and rule, with all your BULLSHIT unopposed! IDIOT!
@SenTedCruz  Any who do not, are NOT doing the job they were elected to do. To put the safety & security of America FIRST!
@_LucidHurricane @SenTedCruz HAHAHAH funniest thing I've read all day!
@SenTedCruz Yes with the help of the Lord Jesus Christ.
@SenTedCruz we should have prevented Cuban refugees too.  They don't embrace American values
@groovatron2000 @SenTedCruz Hmmm Rafael might be considered a Cuban refugee... Interesting.
