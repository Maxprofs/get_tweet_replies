@JaySekulow Ask why U.S. releasing 6 Iranians jailed legally here for 4 Americans taken hostage held illegally there?
@carmenlaberge @JaySekulow Common Sense says WE WANT OUR MEN BACK. Shame on you! Cold human being
@AngelEyes9033 @carmenlaberge @JaySekulow This administration has literally torn apart our country. His agenda has been detrimental to all.
@Roco_76 @carmenlaberge @JaySekulow actually bigots have torn our country apart because there is a black president everything is against him
@AngelEyes9033 @carmenlaberge @JaySekulow How do you think he was elected twice? His agenda is disastrous,not the color of his 50% .
@Roco_76 @carmenlaberge @JaySekulow read tweetsAllOver the Internet the bigots have comeOut of the woodwork in full force.trumpDrawn themOut
@AngelEyes9033 @carmenlaberge @JaySekulow Well not all of us who voted and find him incompetent is due to color. In fact most of us.
@Roco_76 @carmenlaberge @JaySekulow not those who voted for him. You're wrong
@JaySekulow @SenTedCruz So? Cruz had nothing to do with that !
@JaySekulow @SenTedCruz
@JaySekulow @SenTedCruz No thanks to you and you GOP fellow travelers.
@JaySekulow @SenTedCruz Yes more informationPOTUS secured the release of 5,not 4,FIVE Americans.R U ThatDark thatU can't AcknowledgeThatGood
@AngelEyes9033 @JaySekulow @SenTedCruz We have confirmed that S Abedini and 3 other Americans have been released from prison in Iran. 3+1=4!
@JimGuidoCA @JaySekulow @SenTedCruz A fifth one was added voluntarily. He's been held for several months and was a student. Five now.
@JaySekulow @tedcruz : fired on our ship, detained sailors,Obama gives 7 more for these 4 Stop the 100 billion and add sanctions.
@JaySekulow @franks_3111 let me guess...at a cost of 1.7 billion?
@JaySekulow @tedcruz : fired toward our ship, detained our sailors, now this bs-the 100billion needs to be stopped and more sanctions added
@JaySekulow Just to keep everything in perspective. Hate Obama for Iran Deal? Read it and Weep:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair …

@JaySekulow @SenTedCruz @FoxNews but according to #Catherine Herriage there are still 2 Americans left in Iran - WHY did @POTUS leave them?
