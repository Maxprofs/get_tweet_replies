.@sentedcruz @un You are more concerned about Israel than Russia interfering in the last general election. You disgust me. #GOPtraitors
Straw man argument. Nobody wants Russia interfering in elections AND Obama f*cked Israel. Get used to the GOP!
.@veal_brian @un I will never get used to the bigoted & evil @GOP. I wll fight it until my last dying breath. Count on it! #GOPisEvil
Well Ant, I admire your spirit & determination. It'd be nice if we had more like you, except willing to work together! 
.@veal_brian I am willing to work with any Dems who don't subscribe to stupid idea you can defeat @GOP by trying to win over Repubs.
What about working with people with whom you disagree, in the interest of making America better for everyone? Just a thought..
Just give it some thought. Hope you had a nice Christmas. I'm going to follow you, b/c I like getting different viewpoints.
Nice talking to you, Ant. Have a great day & follow me back if you like. Thank you & God Bless 
If sending over $38 BILLION in tax money is systematic weakening Israel that's news. @UN
Despite what most Liberals think, throwing money at something doesn't fix everything. Obama Admin despises Israel!
Has throwing $38 billion in American tax money at Israel fixed anything? @LVBurke @SenTedCruz @UN
Since when does just "throwing money" at any issue fix anything? You probably think Obama is the most pro- POTUS ever, huh?
I wish you all would be that outraged with Russia after messing with our election, and investigate DT.
they don't care, they all won, now they can all destroy our country! Starting with letting old people die! Greedy!

well that would be true if we hasn't won the popular vote Too bad This is the Republicans when trump is done with ya! Excited 
Take that "popular vote" argument & $5 to Starbucks. Then let me know what it got you...
whatever dude
Thank you, Senator! Please defund the UN. We don't want them here
.@sentedcruz @un Israel has broken international law via illegal settlements & Pres. @BarackObama was right to let it be condemned.
Anthony, respectfully, your facts are wrong! Read some history.
.@littlemsliberty @barackobama @sentedcruz @un A history in which Palestinians are entitled to nothing is a false history.
Palistinians are intitled to Murdering Jews?  I think not. #Recognize Israel
No,and of course I recognize Israel.
@groworx @UN Thank you Senator Cruz!! Totally agree with your sentiments! This is a total disgrace,yet again,by the Obama Admin!
My gosh don't even put that out there! Jan 20 can't come soon enough!! Obama doesn't put the US 1st, 2nd or 3rd
.@SenTedCruz @UN #WeThePeople want out of UN & we want the UN out of America. It is a disgusting biased org. of despots. Take BO with them.
I posted the SAME comment. We have better use for the money and don't need the BS that accompanies the UN.
shall we say infrastructure!  Let's use the $38B to rebuild our roads and bridges first!
For anything but a pulpit to condemn the U.S. Put it in Venezuela, call it the "Chex Chavez"!
Cruz you LIE as usual. What about 38Billion from Obama Admin. We believe in 2 State Solution like many American & Israeli  Jews.

@SenTedCruz @MarcoRubio = great team effort during the primary debates. Screw Woodrow & the @UN
#StanddWithBibi
What's really a shame is that NO ONE in Congress has had the spine to IMPEACH & remove fraud Obama in 8 yrs!!!
@BuryHeadInSand @UN  Oh look, another fairy story just like Santa Claus and to think Trump called him Lyin' Ted #revisedreality
IMPEACH HIM - It's not too late!!!!! Then we won't have to pay his retirement benefits! He doesn't deserve them!
@wraithvenge @UN Then putting them into our Country. Protecting them instead of Americans! Why not safe zone in their Country?
Ride the U.N. like a bronco busting Texan..
Obama's systemic agenda??? Hypocrisy is alive and well in the Republic-CON ARTIST party
Beyond disturbing!! Good riddance Obama's. M so thankful we have TrumpPence!
Thank you, Senator! Please defund the UN. We don't want them here
yes sir!  Turn the UN into affordable condos and ship the spies out to Europe
Defund the UN & cancel aid to every country involved!  No more of our money to terrorists or their sympathizers!
great idea !
Obama is a racist!!
Obama, Eric Holder, VanJones and other commies
Ted we stand with you and the nation of #Israel God bless and keep up the good fight!
@GeneMcVay @UN THE KING IS A FINK...That's putting it very mildly. #MerryChristmasDay to all
Goofy alias Ob ama is the most systematic bully,an Is lamicized,radicalized hooligan torturing betrayed Israel.
amen
Ted Cruz sees a demonic purpose behind everything done by Obama. It's a problem Ted has no will to overcome.
@andersonDrLJA @UN / Thats actually another negative political propaganda to undermine the great diplomatic work B.Obama did. 
#defundtheUN #StandWithIsrael
I thought the vote was a culmination of continue Israeli ILLEGAL settlement expansion.  Guess we'll agree to disagree?
how is it strengthening its enemies? By telling them to STOP destructing people's homes so they can have some life?
Amen to that!!
very well said. Shame on them. God Bless Israel
HE DID THE SAME TO OUR COUNTRY.  WHAT A PIECE OF WORK.
as usual, you just throw stones with to plan.  How to get to peace?
Genesis 12:3
@POTUS Obama you are a disgrace and every step you take to take control again... will fail! Disgusting human being! 
Just for the record, the only country Obama hates more than Israel, is the USA. Traitor Manchurian POTUS!
Years ago, Obama told us all he would side with the Muslims.
Obama is a coward and hiding out at private golf clubs in Hawaii. Shameful betrayal of our most trusted ally in the region.
@andersonDrLJA @UN then DO something about it instead of writing a letter
#UNDEFUND
ELIMINATE ALL FUNDING and send them to another country. The current UN is anti American and we don't need to be part of it
Well said Senator
thank you senator! Just wanted to you to know that you were my choice in the primary and in the general election!
Shut it down
BLAME THE BLACK DUDE, BUT LET THE OTHER WHITE NATIONS THAT VOTED "YES" OFF THE HOOK, U WEAK TED, LINDSEY, AND OTHERS.
There will never be PEACE as long as Israel continues to build settlements in Palestinian territory! That's a FACT!
Israel is not above the law and doesn't get a pass. Stop the silly soundbites Ted.
agreeing. UN is not the 1947 UN!
thank you @SenTedCruz it is good to know that not everybody is for sale.
Barack is the most ungrateful, evil and vicious US PRESIDENT. Used his power to fund his lavish lifestyle. Pathetic
@badd_andy @UN  It has been his whole 8 year agenda for the United States also
Thank you @SenTedCruz! The @UN is disgraceful. I hope they are removed from being on US soil. Obama is clearly an antiSemite.
I admire your putting a voice to your and our outrage about Obama siding with the enemies of our friend Israel.
"@SenTedCruz @pomgirl2010 @UN
YEEESSS!!!
@ChuckNellis @UN A disgraceful, despicable, shameful act by an administration solidifying it's place as the worst in US history!
put him and the bit-h on a papyrus boat to Kenya
@nytimes What does an illegal immigrant care about this - I think you have bigger problems with President Trump...
Talk is cheap. Back it up.
Obama's action today is disgusting and shames Americans who respect & treasure Israel. Anti-Israel = unforgivable IMO.
I agree with you so much I don't consider myself a democrat because of this sick stuff and I voted for trump over clinton
You R 100% correct #IsraelUnderAttack #UN #JewishLivesMatter #Obama #JoeLiebermam #Israel #IsraelBetrayed #obamasucks #MAGA
Good
@realDonaldTrump Defund the UN! They are a disgusting and hateful group. NO more of our tax dollars going to UN
...And stop ALL aid the U.S. sends to each country that voted "yes" on this resolution! 
amen Ted!
@K1erry @UN where's Schumer's statement on this issue???
- Where did the $10 trillion go that the Obama administration spent?
part went to Solyndra and his campaign for 2012
Supported by the kapo @SenFeinstein
@rlockrocks
moslem barry shows his true colors.
thank you sen cruz. The UN is a joke. Singles out only democracy in Middle East while the rest of the Middle East burns. 
he's a one man bull in a china shop of diplomacy
If you feel that way & you are a true believer then call for our constitution to be revoked & America a Israel territory
Throw the UN out of NYC. Please do us the favor. Incompetent group of idiots.
Obama should have been impeached years ago!
couldn't agree more.  There's enough treason in this SOB to crucify him to an Islamic cross like a Salem witch
@Jami_USA @UN that will all change after the 20th of January
too long to wait! Lots of damage can be done in 30days! He's on a scorched earth hate spree.
Poor Israel, it's tough to be a regional super power backed to no end (except one vote) by a global super power.
Why did 14 UNSC members vote yes: UK,France,Russia,China,Angola,Egypt, Japan,Malaysia,NZ,Senegal,Spain,Ukraine,Uruguay,VZ
You are clearly morally bankrupt if you think that's all there is to Justice being done on behalf of a beleaguered people @SenTedCruz @UN
Agree 100% we need to stop funding UN. Thanks for standing up for an important ally.
Actually it's the Obama admin's decision to stand up for international law; Isreal illegally settled in Palestinian land.
#StandWithIsrael #StandWithIsrael #StandWithIsrael #StandWithIsrael #StandWithIsrael #StandWithIsrael #StandWithIsrael
The UN needs to move to Haiti. Walk the walk, not just talk the talk. Do something for them.
we need @realDonaldTrump to get us out of the UN!
@realDonaldTrump 
Need to impeach Obama. Traitor to USA @GOP devote PRO muslim!! Hates USA. Wants to destroy USA from within
Well said.
Obama should have been impeached long again. He has been USA enemy within plain sight. Pro Muslim. BO goal: Lead UN. ANTI-US
Suspend the funding to the UN!! We, the American Citizens, should not stand for this!! Stop Obama & his hatred!!
oh sure Obama has pure hatred.he only sent 38 BILLION dollars of our tax money. Please explain how that's hatred

Suspend funding immediately. Continue until UN ceases support for terrorist states.
RT this resolution against Israel is WRONG !!!
Defund UN -Democrats have been cloaked anti-Israel for 6 years - more & more Jewish citizens will vote Republican
NO MORE ILLEGAL SETTLEMENTS! END THE ZIONIST OCCUPATION OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE HOLY LAND YOU FUCKEN MASONIC SATANISTS!!
ah yes he put the final icing on the cake/what a moslem traitor
This is Obama's greatest accomplishment! We are sick of handing Israel a blank check! They get free healthcare and college!
Cruz must be really upset! He is one of the most outspoken Zionist traitors in America. We need to eliminate the enemy in DC
pull his SS detail. As a private citizen he gonna need it. Bet he don't see 60. Mossad can direct a bad car wreck covertly..
Israel's enemies? Like Russia? Lol.
#cutoffallunfunding
yes, what other interpretation could there be
Obama never represented US why would anyone be shocked he threw our allies under the bus.
oh were your feels hurt snowflake?
so true...so sad...all changes on Jan 20th
wrong weasel face!!!
More corruption & collusion of globalization we fund 22%  the UN budget 2x times more than any of the top 17 contributor
Too late to start impeachment proceedings?
drefund this worthless org.
Stop ALL "voluntary" contributions to the UN immediately. Get the UN out of the US and move OUR Embassy to Jerusalem Jan 21!
Get the UN out of the US and move OUR Embassy to Jerusalem Jan 21!  Amen to this suggestion.
- Obama is a scumbag!
you are too kind!
Obama fails to see, or understand, who is really in charge of Israel, as do the rest of the Arab world.
then yank the purse strings.
He should have been impeached long ago. I feel your pain sir, you alone were the lone voice of reason in the senate!
imagine that.A US president is working 2 strengthen our enemies.He's gearing up for when he is a citizen of the world again
Strengthening our ememies....
Even on a short tweet, a typo makes it through. Argh.
