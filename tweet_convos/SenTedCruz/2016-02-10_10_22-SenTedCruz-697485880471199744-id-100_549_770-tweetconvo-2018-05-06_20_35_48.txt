@SenTedCruz Take you message back home to canada
@Trumps1stMember @SenTedCruz WHY?
@ForReal87 @SenTedCruz you can stay you look cool. join the trump train we need good men like you
@Trumps1stMember @SenTedCruz I love Trump. What he does and the way he does it.  However, my man is Cruz.  I WILL vote 4 whomever the nom is
@ForReal87 @SenTedCruz Tell your man cruz his services to this country are best rendered by taking heat off trump but backing him all along
@Trumps1stMember @SenTedCruz lol. Stay tough man. Long way to go and the enemy are the Democrats and establishment Republicans
@ForReal87 @SenTedCruz I used to think so too then ur boy started playing canadian rules and was unmasked as part of the problem
@Trumps1stMember @SenTedCruz gotta let that Canada stuff go.  Cruz is 100 % American
@SenTedCruz Unless they want an abortion, then it becomes government business.
@SergeyPsh @SenTedCruz Should murder be government business? That's how pro-lifers view abortion.
@patriot17761980 @SenTedCruz I'm well aware of how pro-lifers view abortion. Their views are wrong.
@SergeyPsh abortion destroys the totality of a unique human individual life .science for mere convenience @patriot17761980 @SenTedCruz
@mark_my_words @patriot17761980 @SenTedCruz it isn't "convenient" to have an abortion. Rape victims (among others) need abortion access.
@SergeyPsh rape victims are a very small percentage of abortions per PP survey. The majority r for convenience @patriot17761980 @SenTedCruz
@mark_my_words it isn't "convenience". It's an important medical decision.
@SergeyPsh the reasons for the medical procedure that kills the preborn are about convenience. The right to life is far more important
@SenTedCruz great Idea, so while us Americans do what we do best what will you Canadian's be doing?
@SenTedCruz  BUT Cruz LOVES his Government insurance/benefits that he Will Always have, Cruz like Government When it is Convenient 4 him

@SenTedCruz A combination of both is good. Balance industrialization with protecting the ecology! Create jobs and USA made products again!
@SenTedCruz as a Canadian Born...this is a very good observation of Americans...
@SenTedCruz i think people were playing the Wikipedia game. They went from: energy, to abortion.
@SenTedCruz 
I could not agree with you more...keep fighting!
@SenTedCruz @JoyKeller1 could not agree more! This Sir is just one of the reasons I am a TED CRUZ supporter!
@SenTedCruz Americans could best do that with single payer health care instead of being slaves to employers.
@SenTedCruz I would be proud to have a son like you!
@SenTedCruz AMEN BROTHER #GrassRootsRising!
@SenTedCruz  Go Ted! Keep up the fight!
@SenTedCruz  you need to get out of the way

@SenTedCruz yes you are correct. You sir are part of the problem that is the Fed.
@SenTedCruz I'm on board one hundred percent Viva Cruz
@SenTedCruz To pave the way to special interest you are supposed to be representing  people
@SenTedCruz @secretary Kerry ted is awaken no more bush wars
@SenTedCruz Is there a way to stop having delegates and electoral votes over ruling the actual votes . I want my vote to elect a President .
@SenTedCruz You should vote for @JohnKasich - He's got a solid plan for how to do just that.
@SenTedCruz YES! They are bringing down the hardworking people of this country.
@sentedcruz private government workers shouldnt work for senate or run for president. go work fr prvt comp.
@SenTedCruz with over 80% of the US in poverty, the prosper part is missing altogether. #solarenergy #NoFossilFuels dream, breathe & survive

.@SenTedCruz a lot of Americans are good at LYING, CHEATING, taking advantage of the poor - it's ok for the govt to protect people
@sentedcruz So a Small Business owner is taxed 4 times just to employ someone. And the government wonders why there is no job growth.
@SenTedCruz Fair Tax gets the government out of the way and unleashes the American people. #FairTaxUpForAVote
@SenTedCruz Your fired needs to be in there christmas cards at the white house.....lol
@sentedcruz Small business taxes for W2 employees.
Take out SS and Medicare.
MATCH SS and Medicare.
Pay Qtly tax per employees.
& Annual tax
@SenTedCruz then you should lead them by resigning from Senate, ending your prez campaign, and going off to dream somewhere
@sentedcruz 1 to 2 person businesses are being taxed just like larger small businesses and those onerous taxes are destroying our growth.
@SenTedCruz And pollute and intimidate and discriminate and bully and injure and duck responsibility and steal and cheat ...
@angryandliberal @SenTedCruz  "Angry Liberal",  isn't that repetitious?
