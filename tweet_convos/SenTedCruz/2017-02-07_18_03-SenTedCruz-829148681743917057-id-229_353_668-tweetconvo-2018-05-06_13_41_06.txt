In Canada we never be turned down because of a preexisting condition
True, but how long will you wait for a surgery?  I've waited 6 months for a friggin MRI!
I waited 2 weeks for 3 MRIs  I don't know what do tell ya #CNNDebateNight
lucky you! Which province. Each prov works differently.
it works the same in each province.  We will never go broke in CA having to pay for Health care
THey all adhere to Can Health Act but how they allot their $ does not work the same & pops are diff
we are not restricted in anyway to what health care we can or cannot have..  There is no limit
There are major limits with home and community care. Not enough open beds, limited in what they get
Ted Cruz is so phony. The ACA works great. YOU need to lower cost.
& how are they going to lower the cost?  That's the problem!! It's not affordable!
They could renegotiate drug prices. There's a lot they could do. IF THEY WANTED. $$$$$$$$$
That's something that has started which I was happy to see
That would be a great help for so many people. We pay more than anyone else in the world.
Agreed! 
DT met with the major pharm companies last week and they agreed to work on that.
YOU SHOULD DO #TAXREFORM ASAP AND REPEAL #FATCA which hurts 9m US citizens overseas.
thank you for that debate! Thank you CNN for providing a real service to the American people.
Bernie you're a winner
Only a miserable person would say mean things about Bernie.
Good job, moderators.  Let's see more of these debates.  Cruz v. anybody would be good.
sanders is gonna kick his ass
"Did ted answer even one question? Bernie is right! Cruz has healthcare but Texas residents don't. Not fair ted
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight Half  of all  millionaiers in the USA  are current or former congressmen- Meet the Press
#CNNDebateNight thts incorrectly frormulated, 50 percent of all US Congressman are Millionaires
Keep that raging socialist out of my health insurance! We the people can make our own choices!! #LessGov @CNN @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
sorry our family is no longer watching the fake news coming out of CNN. We can no longer trust the reporting.
You're fake news!
CNN should be fair. Kinda like Hillary moderating the debate. Maybe she'll be a guest host?
Someone explain why a parents employer have to pay for a 25 year old that should have a job and their own ins.
BECAUSE THOSE "GREAT" AMERICAN  JOBS DON'T PROVIDE,  YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT B4 VOTING FOR THE TRUMERY
our country needs more debates like that and far less coverage of misleading sound bytes that distort issues
Great job @SenTedCruz!
One lesson learned tonight - We should discuss/debate more and protest/threaten less. Got that @nyuniversity
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight more cowbell and your solution Ted- more BS!

Bern's closing st8ment is same old divide & conquer libtard tactics.
I say We The people should repeal paying health insurance for Sen/Congress.Give the vouchers after they pay OOP
Damn, this debate reminded me of the Tyson-Marvin Frazier fight. Over n first 20 seconds! #CruzbitchslappedBern
Sen Cruz you are NOT answering this father's question!!!!!!!!!
Young ppl are getting subsidies which lowers their prems. Again, my cousin pays $98 monthly prem, same doc/plan
these 2 should've been the ones going head to head for president. But the DNC wanted HRC and screwed Bernie
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight and how about Scandanavia and Germany Ted, why always England?
who's going to pay for it Medicaid we middle class
Bernie is RIGHT!!!! Ted is a GREEDY Republican who cant say Rich people first, screw the rest of you.
what purpose does debate serve? ACA, isn't going 2b dismantled republicans r retracting threats no plan
pick your own doctor regulated by government to keep insurance straight! Get them Bernie!
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight   a law book definition of Rights, Ted- in accordance with what is good proer and just
health care should be a non profit
utility.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight you are a lawyer, just not a very good one, look at the def. of Rights in a law text book
ACA provide tax credits for small business owners  and tax credits if their employees wage less than 50k.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebate your
why don't we health insurance companies non-profit companies.
That way we take out greedy health care CEO's.
(2) Gov't is precisely WHY paperwork costs r so high. Bernie's argument=eating more candy 2 fight diabetes!
Now the old socialist is arguing that gov't is the solution 2 reducing administrative paperwork compliance! (1)
someone plz tell them election is over. Talk about how we can improve affordable health care for common people
Cruz as usual demagogues the entire evening . He is useless
So some people really don't know that Obamacare and the Affordable Health Care are the same things? Damn.
Bernie just called a small businessperson a de facto villain. Keep alienating the economy's engine, Bern.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders We Canadians go to the US as there is no waiting list cause you can't afford it. No issues with our care
Please stop calling it Obamacare. It's the Affordable Care Act. You are feeding into people's uneducated hate on the legislation.
90% of Obamacare participants receive subsidies and increased premiums don't apply that population.
Why is this on. Sanders will never get Medicare for all and it's funny how he talks about rich getting ins.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight keep talking Ted , you are the best argument for Social Medicine, not Bernie
Preventive testing should be free for everyone?
Many confuse their increase prems & healthcare plans they get from their employers as Obamacare.
I knew this debate would be useless. No answers. Just arguing
Can you imagine the billions Insurance companies would make if there weren't gov mandates?
ACA (Obamacare) mandates free physicals & preventive care. Free mammogram & cervical cancer screening.
ACA no spending caps.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight In Florida in 1996 they amputated the wrong leg of a patient in the hospital

My cousin lost her job &now only work part-time 2-3 days wk. She enrolled ACA her monthly prem is $98& she has her same doc

The nurse practitioner received her insurance via her employer. Her premiums negotiated via her ER, that's not the fault of ACA
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight 10's of thousands of Swedes are coming to the USA for heart operatons, your deraming Ted
Cruz says he was born in canada?  Can he run for the presidency?  He speaks of provincial governor's! They r
premiers!
He speaks of our health care.he is misinformed about the waiting times, etc....
who in their right mind want to go back to preexisting conditions, annual/life time maximums?
the R's want a world where it's everyone 4 themselves. They care more for corporations & lobyists than the ppl.
true fact, those that complain how expensive plans are under the ACA would have NO insurance w/out it. Fix it!
don't be fooled the R's want to also do away with Medicare & Medicaid and make them block grant programs.
great fact, the ACA did away with preexisting conditions, annual and lifetime limits.
true fact, ACA was a compromise and most of it's problems are due to R's demands to limit it in order to pass.
You can work together. Because essentially you want the same.
Not a Cruz fan, but he's killing it 2nite w/ fact-based common sense. Just wearing Sanders out.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight W
Choices went down because Obamacare would not let insurance companies rip you off anymore, so they quit!
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight no ted you are the best argument
#CNNDebateNight they are on a waiting list in England for tests Ted but on mmedicare an dying in the USA
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight )ou are right  about the wait in England, Ted but they still prefer their own system
Because they've never known anything else (since late 1940s).
sure they do, when they live and work on the USA, I was under the German system for 8 yrs,I know
I worked for a U.K. company for 15 years. UK employees loved our system here.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders did Bernie spit in his hand before he shook Cruz's?  I hope so.
Dems using this bum who never made a private sector paycheck as authority on healthcare speaks 2 why they lost
I was afraid to see dr not because of $13,000 ded.It's bc if they found something,it's pre ex and no more cov
Sen Cruz, we wait here to be seen by drs already!!!! And pay a fortune. Health care is broken. Unethical here
watchtower the lies? We the people know you socialist that wife bankrupted the college she took a 10mil loan did it in!
I liked Bernie even tho' I don't vote for him based on fiscal policies but then he got his beach house #sellout
Does CNN slip the lefty the questions in advance for this or is that only in election season?
that old man should be put out to pasture. Government wasn't meant to be a career.
That alone makes the sob stories irrelevant.
CNN is already interrupting Ted Cruz and letting Bernie say what he wants.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight ask Ted how Germany whose economy is in much better shape than ours  affords  social med.
Every GOP proposal prohibits insurance co.'s from excluding ppl w/ pre-existing conditions from coverage.
Medicare for all, single payer!
nice try producers, trying to take TEDS opening statement from him. Ahh, my nerves.
Ted answer the question about Pre Existing Conditions
ewwww how could you touch a dirty communist Ted?
& here comes CNN w/ the 1-off sob stories. Repealing ACA won't leave ppl insurance-less. Will b a replacement.
Can't watch this anymore. Debate style, high negative energy. Bye.
What is the point of this
post ACA will cover pre existing? But at what cost? The pool's rate will be ski high
cruz answer the question!
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight I never paid for a cancer drug under  German system Ted but every other drug cost me 1.50
affordable healthcare, should be available to all!
oh insurance companies will still cover pre-existing conditions. They'll just charge 25x more
Almost everyone has ins determined pre existing. Even my kids who are small were considered to be uninsurable.
these two should have been nominees for POTUS not HRC definitely not Trump
In left corner, beast from east, @SenSanders
In right corner, test from west, @SenTedCruz
Ding! Ding! @CNN
Bern Cruz! TX wants ACA. #Cruz doesn't care about ppl. Only getting his way.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders LMFAO.  Pretending.  'Hey, Ted, let's pretend we won the primarys'.  Useless.
Health care should not be a profit making of billions of dollars.Why doesn't America have good health care?
Cruz is making intellectual mincemeat out of Bernie. Sanders' tired talking points vs. Cruz stating FACTS.
I own sm business and am self insured. Insurance before ACA was a nightmare. Covers nothing. Riders to exclude.
sad fact: 35% of Americans don’t understand that Obamacare is just another name for the Affordable Care Act
sad fact:  the poorest red states that support Trump and want to repeal the ACA are its biggest users.
Ted Cruz is a totally annoying human being
So long as government allows corporations to deduct employee healthcare premiums, government runs all healthcar
so Cruz wants Big Pharma to have LESS regulation and LESS protection for consumers.
Bernie 1st word out of his mouth is a put down to Republicans. ACA Law was 2 destroy economics & health & not an easy fix
For #Republicans money should be used for bombings in Middle East not to take care of americans. #Trump = #Bush
The govt has to insist ins co cover because they don't want to on their own. Why would they. They want profit.
Does this socialist know how to make reasonable, factual arguments? No - Bernie only argues sky is falling.
@cnni @SenTedCruz @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight It is about Promises Ted,but you don't see  promise of  immediate repeal a broken promis
no CNN does more harm than good
Before ACA quotes I got were astronomical because of pre-existing condition. After ACA it was affordable
my money is on the Ted
#cnndebatenight What if the system is bifurcated? Competing system of ACA & GOP proposal?
I hope every channel reminds us that Ted Cruz is master debater like they used to ...  only because it sounds funny
ACA needs to be tweaked, stop allowing hospitals 2B sued, allow country wide insurance options & regulate them.
Bernie you are right!!
-Cruz's a liar & chicken sh!t 4 defending a man that said his dad had something 2 do w/ Kennedy assasination
dont watch debates where there is a comunist/socialist debating so no thanks!
Go Bernie!!
Cruz wants de-regulation of the insurance industry. Pull his receipts; how much in donations has he received?
