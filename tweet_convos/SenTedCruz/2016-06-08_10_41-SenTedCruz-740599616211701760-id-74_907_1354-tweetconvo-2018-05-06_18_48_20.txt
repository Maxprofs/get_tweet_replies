<<<---#trolls4trump, and clinton. @SenTedCruz @CplSoletrain @POTUS
Lol.  Trolls for Trump?  Lol.  I don't think so.  It's was a serious question.  The rationale for the bill escapes me.
It would escape you. You have the IQ of a rock. @jedbettman @AmericanCitize5

Even if true, mine's higher. So I win. @gary4205 @jedbettman @AmericanCitize5

In 2018, Rick Perry will introduce you to unemployment.

Lame Duck Obama s/b restrained from any & all legislation affecting America which degrade & harm our way of life
Ted, why are you making up windmills to fight.  Looser.
... introduce the Protect Educators Act, so media can't demand universities be criminal tribunals devoid of due process.
... the Department of Education has no Constitutional authority to tell universities to adjudicate campus assaults.
you shoud be ashamed of yourself sore loser u no good
If you wanted to protect internet freedom, you wouldn't have been against net neutrality! Sadly, U suckup to corp. execs.
Increasingly clear people comment, but don't understand govt. Hail BO, while he gives China more control over internet.
Bless you! If I can't have you for my POTUS yet then I'm moving to Texas to have your represent me there! Keep on!
Thank you for your continued efforts to protect USA interests.
...N-O-W   I-F   Y-O-U   C-A-N  G-E-T  I-T  P-A-S-S-E-D  !!!

Was POTUS suggesting we give away .gov and .mil? Has he got an exec order hidden & waiting? WTF? Something's wrong w/you
Ted Cruz must never sleep. Thank you sir.
@cgpb @POTUS 'Bout time you started earning your bloated salary again.
aren't you for smaller government?? You want the government to regulate the Internet? Wow. What a hypocrite.
. Thank you!
Thank you for trying to #StopTheInsanity of Obama's radical changes to America.

Sir- don't you have more important things to do like Vote on a new AUMF and confirm a SC Judge? #CowardsinSenate GSD

Why would you try to protect the Internet when it belongs to everyone. Is this a way for you to try to control US & POTUS

Lincoln was right to lead the people in prayer for #America…
Thank you #TedCruz for consistently working on behalf of the American people to #MakeDCListen. God Bless you!!
@POTUS
Will this let Comcast, Verizon & Time-Warner decide where you can surf the web & what content you can view?
how about protecting it from FBI snooping without a warrant
Get behind Trump or u will be guilty if Hillary gets elected.  Time to unite ! @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @DanScavino
thank you, Senator Cruz
thank you
Sir if the PEOPLE lose the internet Then the people lose all their GUNS...plain and simple hair politics
(Any bill )that passes to shut down the internet must carry provisions to confiscate all guns from citizens effective now
secrecy is not the future/ transparency and communications is the present and the future

I hope the Mexican judge is more honest than the Mexican businessmen who used the court system to avoid paying me the money they owe me.
sir leave the internet alone, we the people of this great nation want our internet as is/
Thank you!
The PIF act 
Liberal gov controls meds,healthcare,edu,food, bathrooms,rail/postal service,borders,income, MSM & Internet.Get TRUMP

Obama and Democrats have a history and track record of expanding freedom. Republicans do not!
Do your job Sen Cruz n vote on the Pres Supreme Court nominee. You havnt done anything for the people in 7 years

Seems you didn't bother to read the article. The question is whether ICANN should have zero accountability.
question is why does the u.s. have to have control over nonprofit organization
Support @tedcruz effort to save the internet! #TedCruz
...how about stopping Dumbo from giving away taxpayer monies to Illegal Aliens! What kind of country R U clowns in Congress?
