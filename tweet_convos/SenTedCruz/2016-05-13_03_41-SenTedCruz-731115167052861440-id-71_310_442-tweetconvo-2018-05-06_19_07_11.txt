??? Ok, have a nice day!
.@nytimes @nytopinion Ted, if US can't afford universal healthcare (as u say) & Israel can, I see no reason pay for Israel's missile defense
if we don't pay isreal missile defence they'll back stab us and go to Russia. Isreal the riches in planet
TALK ABOUT THE ONE percent. No my Hebrew I have been here in the USA for 500 hundred. Don't try..
The ONE man that STANDS unequivocally WITH Israel IS Ted Cruz @nytimes @PatriotGinger @Reince @GOP
@SenTedCruz Maybe try Dancing with the Stars? Or MTV? Fox? Real-estate? As a politician I think the people have spoken...
isreal know how to take care of themselves . You don't see isis in isreal. Hum! I wonder why.?
.@nytimes @nytopinion If only we could sanction Iran's missile program, stop Iran's nuke development & give Israel billions in defense aid..
FUCK ISREAL FREE PALESTINE
Not happening....
Who's ally? USA is under attack by it's own government allowing Muslim invasion 2 convert Sharia garbage more important
thank god Cruz is out.... The world can breath a sigh of relief
Saudi Barbaria is the medieval nation setting the whole Middle East on fire & this freaking moron is obsessed with Iran
U seek power not b/s u happen to hv some great vision for our nation, but simply for its sake, & it's disgusting!
Comment section was closed, so I hv to come to ur shitty address ....
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion Israel is NOT our ally, this is why you won't ever be President   stop worrying about Israel #AmericaFirst
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion POTUS needs to stop making BS deals with Iran and hanging out with Communist in Cuba!!!!!
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion hope iran wipes them off the map tbqhfam
I support Israel.
@BPAPPA_69 @nytopinion 
#TedCruz trying to be relevant. 
This Obama regime couldn't care less about #Israel 
@realDonaldTrump
Stay in ur Freakland Texas! It's nauseating to hear from u, see u, or even think that u r out there oozing pure shit!!
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion sure skippy , Like your the voice of America.. where the fuck were you born?   you leading me. lol LOSER!
any who questioned him were shut down!  Where is the most transparent administration he promised?

@peddoc63 can anyone really argue with this statement? 
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion Pres Cruz would stand with Israel VoteCruz in remaining primaries #DumpTrump #BringBackTed#

@SenTedCruz @nytopinion PUSH for impeachment then GET ON IT MAN Joe Biden can finish the term.
Barack Hussein Obama the best friend Iran has
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion A Trader is a Trader . Doesn't matter You Sold out Canada . Americans Hate 2 Faced liars The Most teddy boy
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion cuckold Cruz spew the rhetoric for his Jew masters like a good goyim
Israel is more than capable of blowing Iran off the map! They have true leadership, not afraid & will not run away!
@benshapiro @nytopinion yes we can.
STFU @tedcruz You were rejected.
@SenTedCruz  Cruz made one statement. The one at the top of Post. His opinion. Many others as well. Still America ..1st amendment
more lip service from Ted Cruz
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion  As always; Cruz is fact less. When Lasers go on line; Iranian Rockets won't even leave their air space.
An Iranian attempt to launch; W/bring a reprisal that will destroy Iran completely; down to last jihadist!
Cruz needs to worry more about the U.S.A.; and less about Israel.  "Netti," more than capable deal W/Iran.
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion Ted is a idiot,we shouldn't even be allys with Israel,They have nothing we want or need.so why are we allys
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion  You should be a SC justice you would be good at that
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion ,Sleek
@SenTedCruz @nytopinion   Ted Cruz...still a leader and Our Choice !
He needs hebrew's money inside the USA, such as GOP, for his next campaign.
eternal life is available thru Jesus, all Arabs,Jews invited
Obama proves his loyalty to Muslims over USA!
ally crap. We give Israel a lot money that could be helping American lives instead of war for profit.
.@nytimes @nytopinion It's easy for @tedcruz to advocate for (more) war when it's not his kids that would be sent into harms way.
Why not? This administration & the NYT could care less. Some should understand what the NYT did during the Holocaust.
so why did Reagan sell them weapons in the 80's.
Raphael needs to shut up and go back to Canada. Interesting how he continues to be a shill for Israel like so many.
the same goes for a senator who threatens our democracy
To stay true to an ally who really is requires diplomacy.
india is a gift cogreshparty to mr donald
@tedcruz is right. Let's roll-out the #dildoTed  #viginaMissleBan & see if it leads to bigger things
.@nytimes @nytopinion America isn't standing idly by. We're selling Israel weapons and giving them intelligence and buckets of cash.
Dear  @tedcruz , you have no credibility. Have a seat and watch, you might learn something!
.... Who Cruz what he says .....
You wish! Seems it is not presidency race, but idiocy.
he is welcome to lead the ground troops from the front.
um, we aren't? @tedcruz
Cruz's trolling for votes. Harper in Canada played he Israel card.
You must love terrorists, I surmise. @nytimes @nytopinion
the biggest threat to this world is still US. Luckily Cruz is out!
Thanks man, constructive! Give me an argument instead.
what say ye Gabriel? What say Ye Michael? Didn't Father say in Zech:14ALL nations will war with her nWo
let them fight.
Israel is the threat, not Iran. Cruz lives in a bubble of weirdness with too many of his compatriots.
maybe Yoza will be greeted by an israeli rocket soon
