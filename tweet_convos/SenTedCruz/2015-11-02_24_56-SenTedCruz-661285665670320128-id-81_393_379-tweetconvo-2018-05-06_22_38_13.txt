@SenTedCruz Actually it represents a long history gov targeting and racketeering. What are you going to do about it?
@SenTedCruz @Shimmyfab Hell yeah!!
@SenTedCruz Obama must take full responsibility for this failure of his administration. #ImpeachObama
@SenTedCruz @SarahPalinLinks Should be breach of LAW.  GOP tossed Nixon out of office for even having the idea.  Obama (supporters) did it.
@SenTedCruz #BlazeDebate, #RNC
@SenTedCruz You realize they were only targeted bc they don't like to pay taxes right? So ya, target their butts. #payyourshare
@SquirellE1 @SenTedCruz you are misinformed we've gone through three audits in 7 years...no penalties!!
@barelybrownW @SenTedCruz Matter of fact when ur done going after them go get big business and all they owe the government #GOPisdone
@SenTedCruz the IRS needs to be diminished as much as possible. Sick of the strong arm tactics!!!
@SenTedCruz @Saint_Obama I'd like to see the U.S. Atty Gen change to an elected position. No more appointed heads of Justice Dept.
@SenTedCruz @leeleemunster More importantly, it's ILLEGAL!
@SenTedCruz @Lrihendry let's do something about it
@SenTedCruz @JUDAHsCHILDREN And the constitution!
@SenTedCruz so you want them to go against all criminals... give them more money... don't tell them to spread justice in crumbs.  #CruzCrew
@SenTedCruz 
Actually it represents a long history of official racketeering. What are you going to do about it?
@SenTedCruz @Lrihendry Yes, but no one will be held accountable. That's criminal.
@SenTedCruz @Lrihendry Correct! Senator, please keep the IRS & VA+ issues on front burner. Emphasize them & taking the 5th! Stop corruption!
@SenTedCruz Cruz says Rich people and Corporations SHOULD NOT have 2 pay Taxes, so lets get rid of the IRS
@SenTedCruz AMERICANS DON'T TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT! YOU'RE CANADIAN! DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR VALUES & DEMOCRACY! UNFIT FOR PRESIDENT!
@SenTedCruz u can't handle a moderator and think you can be potus?fyi you never answered @BeckyQuick question. Gotcha question was too much?
@SenTedCruz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ebiwO0bCw&feature=share â€¦
@SenTedCruz IT SURE DOES
@SenTedCruz   Do not know who is more contemptible .  IRS or Hillary.  Real toss up.
@SenTedCruz   IRS  should have been shut down years ago.  Most of their legitimate services can be outsourced.
@SenTedCruz you still barkin up that tree? That dog never did hunt.
@SenTedCruz isn't that what you do?
@SenTedCruz http://fixingairconditioning.blogspot.com 
@SenTedCruz  since when is the tea party a charity?  Since NEVER
@SenTedCruz if it were true, yes. But don't let that stop you because you wouldn't have much going for you if you did.
@SenTedCruz @yunsun1967 Oh come on Senator, little old IRS? Their only the most powerful collection agency in the world! Fire them! #fairtax
@SenTedCruz breach of trust? It is criminal!
@SenTedCruz You think?
@SenTedCruz Lois Lerner got a free pass.  SHE walked away. Talk is cheap.
@damienrecords @SenTedCruz #BlazeDebate, #RNC
@SenTedCruz I'm voting for you Mr. Cruz. GoTeamCruz
@SenTedCruz It wasn't because of politics it was to see if their pack was really doing what they said they were!
@SenTedCruz and lois Lerner gets a pass
@SenTedCruz you mean the abuse of tax exempt status on both sides of the aisle?
@SenTedCruz And those responsible should be brought to justice, even if they sit in the Oval Office.
@SenTedCruz you corrupted politicians breach public trust ling time ago, wht does it mean? Absolutely nothing. U guys r clowns
@SenTedCruz #BlazeDebate
@SenTedCruz same way u targeted ACA by shutting down the Gov't; costing $24billion; effecting 1mil Fed workers pay b/c of ur grandstanding
@SenTedCruz Time to scrap the repulsive 70,000 page failure known as the #ProgressiveIncomeTax for a simple system. SimplyTax ALL 8%
@SenTedCruz Sounds like and reminds me of China, N. Korea, Russia, etc....
@SenTedCruz Obama said "Not a smidgen of corruption" A lie or to let his people know Not to look into. My guess Both
@SenTedCruz to say the least
@SenTedCruz yes sir and the scumbags got away with it..
@SenTedCruz @Ward4Anderson Except they didn't!
@sentedcruz and the Justice Dept. doesn't care, so we get screwed. Thanks for nothing, USA.
@SenTedCruz There is no trust of a senator owned by billionaires. None. No trust at all.
@SenTedCruz its also against the law but no one has or will go to jail
@SenTedCruz Beautiful letter Senator
1) Will she comply?
2) Would Hillary or Bernie pursue it?
Disgusted in Colorado
@SenTedCruz And Americans are ballistic about IRS culpability...& guilty walking unscathed into the sunset The Justice Dept needs oversight!
@SenTedCruz Ok thanks .
@SenTedCruz how much money did those that got their tax exempt status,
contribute to charity? to politicians? 
@FoxNews @FoxBusiness
AMEN @SenTedCruz #prosecute the corruption and #AbolishTheIRS!!
@SenTedCruz Name one human being who was targeted. Can't do it, because there aren't any.
@rcfwilmette @sentedcruz What hole you been living in @rcfwilmette? Same Chicago gutter that Obama crawled out of?
@LouisianaEagle @SenTedCruz So I assume you can name at least one human being targeted by the IRS or do you just specialize in ignorance?
@SenTedCruz The failure to prosecute or even credibly investigate exacerbates the damage. Media disinterest adds insult to injury.
@SenTedCruz How about just eliminating tax exemption for any organization choosing political sides?
@SenTedCruz If any of the honest people running for office today win.  There will be MEGA doc destruction at the WH before anyone vacates.
@SenTedCruz # And we will not forget.
@SenTedCruz My trust has been breached after Obamacare passed. This was straight out illegal!
@SenTedCruz senator,  the Truth doesn't matter to those in power today. In fact it will harm them.
@SenTedCruz Not to BHO. & who beside maybe Trump will take him. Certainly not congress.
@SenTedCruz Praying you become the next POTUS so you can stop this from happening again! 
#CruzCrew 
#Cruz2016
