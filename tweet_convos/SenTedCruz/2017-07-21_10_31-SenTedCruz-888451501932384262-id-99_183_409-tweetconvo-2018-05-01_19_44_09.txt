So misleading.

Please vote no on this horrible bill, Senator. Or Texans will vote no on you in 2018.
Hey Ted, why do you think the healthcare insurance industry is reporting record profits, in the billions, for last quarter?
Makes smart sense. That means the Democrats will vote against it
Who cares if the plans won't cover basic health needs. YOU'RE COVERED with ZODIAC CARE!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn bipartisanship and get something that works!
The market will adjust. Competition among providers and ins companies will drive prices down
Let's talk about the real disaster Trump's administration!
You are a snakeoil salesman like your boss.
And covers nothing. Be real. And people who really need insurance will get higher premium. Tell the whole story!
#VOTENO
People like you are reasons why

Your amendment decreases health coverage for women how does that help society?
Hey swamp creature, Ted Cruz, quit your lying!https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2017/07/21/ted-cruz-amendment-health-care/%3Fsource%3Ddam …
Get it done!!! Long overdue!!
Too bad they can't deport you to Canada ... where you were born while your draft dodger daddy hid out so they wouldn't send him to Vietnam
ACA is not a disaster TRUMPcare is. #betofortexas
STAY STRONG
Look what metro pcs and cricket did to the cell phone providers. They used to screw the public, now they have to compete on a level field
Why can't I hust get a health savings account with a catastrophic medical plan. Then pay out of pocket for the small stuff.
Unless your extremely wealthy or poor you get screwed. Middle incomers over 50 get "f"ed no matter what congress does
There is no constitutional provision that allows government to manage my healthcare. Get gov't out of health insurance.
Mystery solved.  It appeared Obamacare died of natural causes, but was actually shot in the head by the GOP
Repeal completely. Your idea is a band-aid to  a cancer.
Yes, a decrease..$7000 less instead of $5000 more? Buddy, you ever hear of "you don't get something for nothing"? Your plan is worthless!
The Dems won't stand for a decrease higher cost equals greater control of their zombie voters
Just saying something is true doesn't make it so Teddy.
Right, like you can keep your doctor, you can keep your carrier - both lies.
So you're solution is to blow up the system and make healthcare unaffordable for all?
Ted Cruz is a baby killing anti-Jesus sociopath.
For the same plan? Is it 7000 less for an apples to apples plan? If it's to good to be true...
@SenTedCruz spreading FAKE news on Fox.
Yeah, lies.
BRCA is a disaster - 22 million no insurance.  For some the deductibles will be more than they earn in a year.  Disastrous for the poor/old.
It should be more expensive for older people. Take care of your parents instead of worrying about others.
Sen Cruz is a disaster. Trump has diverting subsidies from ACA to make it fail.  What kind of leaders are these?  Putin's boys, apparently
Name ONE insurance company that will guarantee better coverage, lower costs to everyone if ACA is repealed.

LISTENING
Are you comparing same kind of health coverage? Less coverage should be cheaper. Junk plans should be dirt cheap. Don't want them though.
Fox and Friends is leading program on Trump State Media. Nothing said on it will ever have an ounce of credibility.
But your "plan" means no coverage in order to have "insurance". Just because you are pendejo does not mean we are. Texas deserves better.
Sadly people don't understand ACA themselves only hear the numbers and no they can't afford it
How about going on some network other than Fox? I bet Rachel Maddow would love to interview you. @maddow
I want the $12/year plan the President talked about.  Where is it?
"A fool with numbers is still, by my count, a fool"--Benjamin Franklin
Don't repeal, fix!
Lies. Renaming immoral legislation doesn't make it better, or the right thing to do. #RightIsWrong
1 more try:Include Maine like invisible high risk pool&buttress Medicaid with $'s planned 4 insure companies,you get Paul,Portman,Murkowski.
And the ACA is a success which is why you hate it.
A $7,000 decrease (of what?) at the cost of 22 million people's insurance? No thanks.
Gives you a Yugo
Your solutions are among the best. Actually wanted you and Trump to team up during the election, but really like your current participation.
An how much coverage will the person lose with how much of a deductible increase? If the deductible increases by 10K....
Exactly. That is exactly what will happen
Focus, focus. The priority is #ImpeachTrumpNow
Why has it not been repealed and where are our tax cuts
Cruz is lying through his teeth. What his plan does it steal healthcare from the old, sick and poor, to fund tax cuts for billionaires.
Vet ashamed of @GOP

ignore an attack on our election

Silence=complicit 

Pass the sanctions bill

Defend Democracy

What will it take
#Liar

What do you care? Throw the sick, poor, disabled & elderly off the boat & the rest of America will be great again. Where have i heard that?
Liar http://liar.you  are and trump are a good pair. Lie lie but you adore him. Didn't even defend your wife. Your not a man a puppet
We all see the real disaster going on and it's not Obamacare.
Sir the president beat in primaries due to Russia! He beat you illegally and treated your wife awful! And now this traitor is running the US
Chicken Shit!
*bippity*
How is that #TermLimits amendment coming??? More empty promises
Just another publicity stunt disguised as legislation. Pretty well describes Ted's impact on the Senate. Thanks for the reminder.

What is wrong with the rest of those idiots in senate, starting with Bitch McConnell.  Ugh.  Repeal CrapCare and tax cuts.  That so hard?
Ted, yr plan is fine as long as u don't get cancer or other serious illness. Please tell the truth.
Thank you Ted!
Alternative facts. Stop.
Even dems say Obama cares a failure
Ted what don't you understand about SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE -How about a rate increase freeze ?
My premiums before Ocare were only $1,584.00 a year! $132/mo. Coverage I wanted. Give me back what I had at the same price.
...for garbage insurance. You forgot that part Ted.
Thank you Sen. Cruz!! Please convince @RandPaul and @SenMikeLee to support this amendment and vote for the MTP. It will lower premiums!!
Only the Fox and Friends people would believe Cruz with his "I'm so smart smirk", guy is lying about the coverage: none
What's the truth then?
I call bullshit senator , your asking us to disregard research and projections #medicare4all is the only way to cover everyone at lower cost
Hand over ur paycheck then, who's gonna pay for free healthcare?  Oh wait, u must not work.
We like it! Fight on good man!
You are one of the major reasons I wish I was a Texan - Love the Cowboys already - Not loving my NY Senators @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand
