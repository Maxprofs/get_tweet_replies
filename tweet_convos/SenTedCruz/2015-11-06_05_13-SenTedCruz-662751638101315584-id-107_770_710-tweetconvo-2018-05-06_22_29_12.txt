@NHTeaParties @marklevinshow @VladDavidiuk @jason_howerton Rand Paul catching on as the "one" across country more than Cruz in the polls?

@michael_scooter @marklevinshow no what I hear is typically what I post redistributed by Cruz NO AVATARS as president.
@OfficiallyVaro @marklevinshow Then I thank you for that because I believe that we need Cruz,a Constitutionalist, more than ever and 1/2

@marklevinshow @KandiRider Aw. Marco Rubio, our next POTUS doesn't merit a word from you?What are you going to do after he's nominated?
@marklevinshow Sens. Cruz & Paul will both sound off. However, I love how Cruz' voice reminds me of Ronald Coleman.
@marklevinshow @bodybynance I respect Cruz but I believe Sen. Jeff Sessions is the conscience of the Senate.#tcot
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz MARK!! Tell Ted to get some TWITTER help & FB help to get his number of FOLLOWERS UP!
@marklevinshow @Southernsonn We must unite behind Cruz & Carson, both are remarkable Americans who can lead by trust & love for country.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz TED CRUZ IS the conscience in Washington!  America NEEDS him 4 POTUS!  #CruzCrew #TedCruz2016 #TCOT #PJNET
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Absolutely. Almost every time Cruz rips them (the Establishment) a new one I donate.Cruz/Fiorina 2016.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz A conscience can, at times, change one's behavior. The Senate does not have a conscience as far as I can tell.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Ted and Mark both need therapy.
@marklevinshow @sirvitup great description of @tedcruz
@marklevinshow @NotSince48 Good lets keep him there. Not ready for the big house.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz every day it's 'Thump 'em with Trump'; meanwhile Cruz grinding toward liberty goal with "3 yds & a cloud of dust"
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz @SenateMajLdr  McConnell/Reid r Anti American as they come, helping Obama destroy the US.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz when is Harry Reid going to lose the other eye since he's already lost his brains
@marklevinshow Ted Cruz at its finest listen to this speech on the Senate floor~ Get to know @tedcruz  he's our man #TakingOnWashington
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz 

Harry Reid is a psycho that need to be put out to pasture. Who votes for idiots like this???
@marklevinshow @re_anderson21 

The Klansman man in the senate
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Cruz has done enough damage to America and its citizens. Vote this twerp out. TX does not want him.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Spelled unconscious wrong Markie!! really think state delegates will nominate this TX clown?? only known in TX!!
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz cruz is simply delusional. He only won TX because of a run off election. He will be out in 2018. #OneTermSenator
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Ted Cruz is the least respected and most hated member- even among Republicans.
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Jebbus Christ on a stick Levin! Have U no sense of Irony at long last? Not to mention Decency?
@marklevinshow and they don't like it!!
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz I'M CONFUSED?? SO WHO'S THE MAJORITY ON CONGRESS!!?? WHY THIS CLOWNS STILL BITCHING OF REID COME ON ENOUGH
@marklevinshow @SenTedCruz Rand Paul* fixed it
@marklevinshow Senator Ted Cruz for President #Cruz2016
RT @marklevinshow @RichardReese3 The conscience of the Senate, Ted Cruz http://fb.me/2Pr6m32gn 
@marklevinshow The Senate is so corrupt.
@marklevinshow go #tedCruzfor2016
@marklevinshow Secure the border,enforce the laws,pass Kate's Law & it will help discourage some felons&cut back on imprisoned. Duh Reid!
@marklevinshow Its about time you support Cruz Mark for POTUS. Only conservative in race with money, organization & ability to win.
@marklevinshow @tedcruz is THE man for President!! 
@marklevinshow one of the reasons I voting Cruz
@marklevinshow @MinneMike Yes! And anyone who thinks he's "phony" do better research! @tedcruz is solid & we better pray he's our next POTUS
@marklevinshow @HarrietBaldwin
@marklevinshow @palmaceiahome1 But, but they said Teddy Kennedy was the conscience of the Senate. Or was that Byrd?
@marklevinshow @triumphtimes @tedcruz <-- Is a true leader. Will be an exceptional POTUS, which the country desperately needs. #cruz2016
@marklevinshow Ted Cruz is leading the fight on every single important issue! #CruzCrew
@marklevinshow He's the David in the midst of Goliaths.
@marklevinshow Absolutely.  But let's not forget Tom Cotton and Mike Lee.  Great men, too.
@marklevinshow I've been leaning more towards Ted recently, this certainly helps the cause
@marklevinshow Him and Captain Tom @TomCottonAR 

(I'm for Cruz @tedcruz , but wtf was he doing voting for Corker's Iranian foot-shooting?)
@marklevinshow we need 500 more like him
@marklevinshow Cruz is characterized radical" by everyone including his own party because he hasn't sold out to the devil called Washington.
@marklevinshow Mr Cruz is a good politician, and trump a business guru. I want to see them team up. It would save America from civil war.
@marklevinshow Imagine if he were the Majority Leader in the Senate, since the Republicans took it over VS Mitch McBoma.
@marklevinshow We all know who @tedcruz is because he doesn't hide behind political correctness while mincing words. He tells it like it is.
@marklevinshow #tedcruz is absolutely right the Reid should just say we can't afford to lock up any of our potential voting base!!
@marklevinshow Far and away the most qualified to be the next President of the United States of America.
@Xtremeritewing @marklevinshow Right about far & away!! voters outside of TX want that..
@marklevinshow All the senators had the power 2 fix the VA & did nothing. It's a election & now they love vets. All talk.
@marklevinshow OR - Cruz grandstanding again and using Senate floor as backdrop. He does NOT build coalitions. Always alone = Problem.
@Diana24724 @marklevinshow Respectfully disagree. He's actually at work doing his job unlike others who are running against him.
@Xtremeritewing better than "The Rube" sure but he tried to put Kate's law, Sanc Cities and PP defund into Highway bill day before voting.
@marklevinshow one of the few adults in the room
@marklevinshow Mr.Levin, there you said it!
@marklevinshow Dysfunctional Senate
