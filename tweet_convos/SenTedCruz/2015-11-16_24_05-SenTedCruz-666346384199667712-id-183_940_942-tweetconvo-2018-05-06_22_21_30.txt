@SenTedCruz How do you know any of the French attackers were actual Syrian refugees? Syrians are fleeing ISIS too.
@CrapDetectr @SenTedCruz @MMQWalker read the news.  4 of the attackers were refugees!  Passports showed when and where they entered!
@laurahudg Read the news: Their Syrian passports were fake. Thus, they weren’t actually refugees.
@CrapDetectr @MMQWalker So they used a fake passport to cross with the refugees?  What is your point?  They still crossed over
@laurahudg @MMQWalker  The point is that all ID’ed attackers thus far have been EU citizens. Not Syrian. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11997820/Paris-France-terror-attacks-isil-suspects-Syria-Raqqa-boming-arrests-live.html#update-20151116-1705 …
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Your inference Ted, is based on what exactly? Let's help those who this country ruined.
@aaarocket37 @CanonJaunt @SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept So Christian of you
@aaarocket37 @CanonJaunt @SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept so all Muslims are savages?
@aaarocket37 @CanonJaunt @SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept 20% are terrorists? Uninformed bigoted "Christian"
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept 4 of the Paris attackers were posed as refugees!  #WakeUpAmerica #NoRefugees #CruzCrew

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept There's no evidence refugees pose threat. This is opportunist religious bigotry by Cruz
@SenTedCruz:  Why wouldnt a terrorist pose as a refugee to get into our country? Seems logical & we need 2 prevent it!
@seanhannity
@mann_cmann1008 @SenTedCruz @seanhannity because coming into the country as a refugee is the hardest way to get in. Why choose hardest way?

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Not practicing American Ideals but acting to retreat  cowardly from them
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept except that thousands have been admitted and have been charged with 0 terror crimes

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept I like you Senator but all you ever do is ask or call for. Time to call them all out
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Yep, exactly what the bible says to do.  Oh wait.
@InTheKlick so Jarod if you can't prove who these people are why would you take them in after the France attack?
@sdalas73 It's obvious you are a frightened,hate filled manchild.Limbaugh,Hannity,etc..has manipulated your mind and fears very effectively.

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Come on Mr Cruz you already knew that's how they do it! TV posturing & bloviating again?

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Ted, your old man, vile as he is, was an immigrant who supported Castro. Remember?
@SenTedCruz Really? Then why are you inviting primitive goat herding Yazidis to come here? NO AS TO ALL REFUGEES WITHOUT SCREENING.
.@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept majority of Paris terrorists were French. Will USA be blocking travellers from France?
@SenTedCruz Christians ?like KKK Tim McVeigh, Dylann Roof , Adam Land a ALL Christians
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept  I want you to be vice president to Trump, he needs your help!
@SenTedCruz To all of you "good Christians" who want to turn away refugees: that's NOT very Christian. #WWJD #refugeeswelcome
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept I agree with Sen Cruz!
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept just treat anything @POTUS does as the threat.
@SenTedCruz @badov49 @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI SCREAM IT TED..LET THEM KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT..IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Thank you Senator for Speaking up. Stay strong. No Syrian Refugees. Obama is delusional.

@SenTedCruz @JohnFromCranber @StateDept @DHSgov @TheJusticeDept ~ Syrian refugees should not be allowed entry to the U.S. #ObamaResignNOW
@SenTedCruz This is what Ted Cruz's leadership looks like.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept ARE THEY GOING TO LISTEN?  WHO CAN I CALL TO VOICE MY OPINION?
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Again we see Ted Cruz being a demagogue
@SenTedCruz asks @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept "to treat refugee flow out of Syria as a national security risk.

AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept go back to Canada. we don't need haters like you in this great country
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept @BarackObama this dam president Doesn't listen to the ppl! Setup refugee camps elsewhere
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept the so called Christian states abandon and persecute the Syrian refugees. Wow impressive
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept  well, thank your lucky stars your father was allowed in from an enemy country.
@SenTedCruz @LibertyBell1000 @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Where does Congress have its head stuck up?

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept ...things are only going to change for the better in the US if you win the Presidency.
@SenTedCruz @Tabitha__Lily @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept
State, DHS & Justice are corrupt. FBI yet to be seen.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept All immigration should be immediately stopped. Can’t trust anyone.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept 
Push down on the flush handle and they'll all go away.

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Sen I ask u again: Will u investigate US funding of Terrorists & NGOs covert activity?
@SenTedCruz  Ask the leaders of these departments to assume full legal responsibility for the refugees they allow entry
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept ISSIS threat are real & people are against accepting them.People don't count. Only BO.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept - Can we make it retroactive for Cubans and Canadians? That would deny you citizenship.
@SenTedCruz @63Smithe @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept @marcorubio Is Senator Rubio weighing in with you??
@SenTedCruz  we are out of control-- Americans died in Iraq -no reason- must threaten those bankrolling Isis
@SenTedCruz - Qatar, Saudis-- that where Isis gets there money-- that's where pressure must be placed
@SenTedCruz @PeterLaBarbera That's what we should have asked Canada to do when y'all emigrated....
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept It is a definite risk no papers no history on ea individual could lie about everything
@SenTedCruz @THETXEMBASSY @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Mitigate RISK~No test/background check can predict future terror behavior.
@SenTedCruz under the current regime, only people treated as security threats are conservatives.
@SenTedCruz you cannot be the lone voice in the wilderness, somebody in this government has got to have the guts to call a spade a spade
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept ... Ask ask ask-need ACTION! ALL OF You will be responsible for bringing terror to U.S.!
@SenTedCruz @ChristieC733 @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept That would require too much common sense.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept How about shutting it ALL down not just from Syria where most aren't from anyway??

@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Why ask? DEMAND that they cease under threat of IMPEACHMENT or CALLS FOR RESIGNATION!!
@SenTedCruz don't even bother to tell us in the future you're a follower of Jesus. You're just a right wing hatemonger.

@SenTedCruz I think today I will endorse Ted Cruz as my next president he is the true American no refugees
@SenTedCruz 
That would take leadership and common sense. We are long overdue for someone that has these qualities to lead this nation!!
@sentedcruz @dhsgov @fbi @statedept @thejusticedept You are doing your part. Time for some democrats to stand up for our national security.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept To add to the list of lost battles you've led?
@SenTedCruz glad you tweeted it too.  Nothing like some grandstanding top off your hard hearted sundae. #callingyouout
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept that's ridiculous.  refugees are not terrorists, they are fleeing the same threat, derp.
@SenTedCruz Wait, so your response to "there might be terrorists" is to start a political witch hunt?  Do you have a solution?
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept but please do not refuse them, everyone wants to now do a 180 on refugees this is not rt
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Speaker Ryan needs to resign he won't commit to stopping flow of Syrians @benshapiro
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Hate to say it,but you're going to have to win before that happens.

@SenTedCruz Does Congress have any recourse?
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept You forgot @KochBothers.
Aren't they your bosses?
@SenTedCruz  @dealDonaldTrump bumper stickers, billboards, radio, tv, newspapers,etc

@LoriKemp that's true he's probably in hiding has no clue what to do I need to talk to someone to help him understand
@R5Glenn All they will say is he hasn't taken a position. Go to the website. Unacceptable!
@LoriKemp that's what they're telling everyone I know has no position how can you have no position
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept That is asking a lot from folks who can't say Islamic Terrorism.
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Right Ted Cruz! Thank you. So glad you're on the scene!
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept don't let it happen and stop all of it
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept Get full Senate on the train.Stop the mindless invitation to slaughter.America first!!!
@SenTedCruz @StateDept @DHSgov @FBI @TheJusticeDept  Shouldn't the President treat this as a threat also????
@hardypilot Obama is not a true American
