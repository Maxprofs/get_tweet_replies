@POLITICOMag @tedcruz People in Washington aren't listening to the American people!!!
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz Why wasn't Ted doing his job, then? He could have stopped this!
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico @SpeakerRyan Ryan is a coward and a fraud as is any Republican who voted for this
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico Cruz has my vote.  He is the only one who has proven to stand on conservative principles throughout
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz  Pathetic republican so called leadership !
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico Damn right they did!!! Thank god Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney did not get elected.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz Yeah,Rafael,if you don't understand compromise, you are more than completely unfit to be Pres
@politicomag @tedcruz. RYAN. SUPPOSE TO BE FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz TED CRUZ IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.   HE HAS BEEN STANDING UP FOR  THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE.  HE'S RISING TO TOP
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @politico with #WarOnChristmas #WarOnWomen #WarOnDrugs y not surrender to #WarOnGOP?Cruz you are clueless.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz  Cruz-Paul 2016!
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz
 YOU can shut up now. Don't you have  else you hate to troll? No one here cares
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz do you really see any difference in a Republican run house or senate and a democrat? #establishmentrepublicans
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @SenTedCruz illustration of why your brilliant move against amnesty had to be handled the way it was.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico pathetic that  politicians slander compromise. It's part of governing-Reagan and Tip Oneill did. #pandering
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz aren't you a Republican...... in Congress???
@POLITICOMag If the GOP is so bad, @tedcruz why don't you walk away from it? You don't need their money, right? You're a hypocrite, again.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico no Ted ... Congress made a choice to do their job for a change ... Hard to believe.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz u r right. Ted
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz Go Ted! CRUZ 2016!
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico  Will Ted Cruz vote like a Democrat as did the House Republicans?
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @politico why ???? No surrender house and senate can override anything Obama vetoes exercise that power
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz some people don't get it.  We are in bed fiscal shape and keep spending.
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz They already have surrendered, Godforsaken Traitorous Backstabbers, who should be thrown out office.
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @politico Nobody is surrendering to anybody. They're just bankrolling their crony capitalism pet projects.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @SenTedCruz,They must go!Those republicans who voted for this massive bill ,are just as culpable as this admin.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz I thought that it was rich for @marcorubio  to critize you for voting against Obama spending packages.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz - they don't want to ruin their chances for 2016 election.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz I think Obama has something on them and they will do his will or he will 'out' them
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz Maybe Teddy needs to reassess how aligned he is w/ ppl...not just the crazy Tea Partiers.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz Democrat's in Republican clothing 
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz Why are they so afraid? Is someone holding a gun to their head. Let's create a new party.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz If we are looking for a GOP president in 2016 it is not going to happen. A party divided.
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz ... It's like I always said there are no two parties! They didn't surrender. They are! Sickening really!!!
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico and Paul Ryan didn't help either.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz : establishment r's say "now everyone will love us!! Tell us we're pretty."
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz You are exactly right and I'm getting tired of it.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz Not surrendering, joining the team! Much worse!
@Shadiwoods @POLITICOMag @tedcruz in order for it to be surrender they first have to fight?  I guess I missed that part
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico #OmnibusBill And for those that liked Ryan - how do you like him now? This is the BEST he could do?
@SACandy @POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico Goldman owns congress:  https://twitter.com/dc7f77654c964c7/status/677916429199503361 … … …
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz , nothing new about that now is there?
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz you can'tsurrender when you were never in the fight.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico REPLACE THEM ALL!!!!
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz "ARE" U mean Have & continue 2 follow the directive of the chamber & the bank fed cartel for the NWO boys
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz so what else is new?  #worthlessrepublicancongress
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz  can i get a bumper sticker of ted cruz
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz compromise is not a dirty word, extremism is
@SkittleNirvana @POLITICOMag @tedcruz the only things being compromised are our Liberty, safety,  economic stability, and our values. #Sold
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @SenTedCruz Their called the establishment of DC the ones who said elect us and  we will  fix Washington and they lied
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz it is time to primary all Republicans that voted for this spending bill.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz this is why conservatives dislike the Republican Party
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico it's totally disgusting how low the left has become just for votes.
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico .. Of course didn't expect anything else out of the traitors
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico amen! And it's making me sick!!! And they wonder why people want Trump?????
@POLITICOMag @tedcruz @politico the GOP party is officially dead
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz   Yes they did,  sad day,  do any of them have a gut any more? ????
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @politico
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz. The establishment is corrupt.  We need Tea Party candidates to challenge most GOPin next election.
@rcasonr @POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz wasn't @tedcruz the one the tea party rallied for? He was the man..
@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @politico #sameastheoldboss
#crapweasels

@POLITICOMag @SenTedCruz @tedcruz surrender is too weak a description.
