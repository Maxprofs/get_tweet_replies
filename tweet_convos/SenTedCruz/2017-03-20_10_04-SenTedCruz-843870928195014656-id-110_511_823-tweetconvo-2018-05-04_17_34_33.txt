True: @SenateMajLdr's claim that not a single Democrat opposed Neil Gorsuch's confirmation in 2006 http://bit.ly/2l6ZdMS  
lmao I guess California and New York should be the only 2 states that votes count then?!
That was then. Maybe Cruz can twist Trumps arm and nominate him instead. After how Trump treated him he owes him.
U can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. FC/GOP utter failure! No $!
use your influence to get health care passed if you really care about any of us. Thank you
I promise you, I will be campaigning against you, with my twitter friends. Your seat needs to go blue. #SwingLeft
@freedomcaucus Ted you've lost all credibility with me. I am one of your constituents & I will remember you selling us out.
@freedomcaucus How did Merrick Garland do when he was confirmed?
@freedomcaucus You got your job by illegitimate means...we all know  .shut up...
.@SenTedCruz @BeanfromPa Dang that was b4 Obama. He ruined his party worse than I even believed. Completely & utterly destroyed it!
you think that makes him eligible, now, for lifetime appointment to #SCOTUS ?  you're dumber than i thought
Tell that to Merrick Garland.
because it wasn't a Trump nomination Ted - do whatever you have to do to get this wonderful man confirmed
@_Proud_American dems should be charged with obstruction of justice anyone with sense knows whats reallgoing on substdrd elites!
You were great up there with him.  Thank you.
@freedomcaucus Let's prep your 2018 goodbye party if you vote "No"
#KeepPromises
@freedomcaucus it's called politics Ted
And not one Conservators offered up a hearing for Merrick Garland.
@freedomcaucus it takes a decade to have a history to oppose.
.@SenTedCruz @freedomcaucus Work on your correlation skills.BTW,less 1yr ago,you said"vote with your conscience"so,what you say meaningless.
@freedomcaucus Doesn't change the fact that you allowed Garland to be screwed out of he's rightful seat on the SC.
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr Stop changing the subject.Dems should obstruct bc THEY WERE ROBBED OF SCOTUS APPT BY U TRAITORS 2
Two decades ago Judge Merrick received a similar confirmation You guys built this dynamic,not us. Karma is coming
A decade ago, Trump wasn't President :) #MAGA
3 DAYS AGO POTUS TRUMP WANTED TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK & THE FREEDOM CAUCUS STOOD WITH PELOSI AGAINST AMERICANS!
@freedomcaucus stick it jerk
@freedomcaucus 

PrivateSchool Truckin' Expert MnVoterFraud @alfranken Wasn't there Doesn't understand Truck heaters

Go @POTUS
Gee, I wonder what has changed the @SenateDems minds? #confirmgorsuch
Their feelings are hurt... getting ran over by the Trump train was not in their plans!
a decade ago he didn't have this decades track record to oppose.
Go Gorsuch!!
You Russian trolls are out thick today
.@SenTedCruz 5 years ago my company hired me as a software engineer. Why am I not CTO now? Unfair. #CruzLogic
Strangely quiet bout POTUS claiming FBI Dir Comey testifying "fake news" to Congress today. Why? Could it be you sold ur honor?
@freedomcaucus But that was before @SenMajLeader broke the nation's constitution by not allowing @POTUS44 nominee. #NOTFAIR.
@demsrdopes Total Hypocrites
well then, why didn't we just skip the lower courts & put him on SCOTUS directly.
@Faye0226 Whole process is one big lie by Dems.  Has nothing to do with the good of the country.
funny, same thing happened with Merrick Garland.Not one Republican spoke in opposition - even praised him! #SCOTUS #PunchHisFace
@tsteves456 no offense but it was a voice vote there's usually not much debate for lower court federal judgeships
it's funny no mention of trumpcare from Ted Cruz.
Vote NAY to Gorsuch. He is far too radical to be placed on our Supreme Court.
And you wouldn't let anyone speak about Garland, would you?
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr  If Republicans vote him into SCOTUS, he will always be the illegitimate judge to 3/4 of Americans. 
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr  Packing the court w a Judge YOU KNOW is going tosway the court in your favor is Republican Corruption
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr of Americans who wanted him confirmed. Keeping a a seat empty because you want an ideologue is corrupt
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr is a consensus candidate who wasn't even given a hearing, let alone a vote. The GOP insulted him & 3/4
@ColumbiaBugle the butt hurt continues!
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr unconstitutionally and now offered to someone else. It's wrong on many levels. Judge Garland is a
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr  8yrs if Clinton won the election. The American people wanted Garland. The choice was TAKEN  from us
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr Ted, This seat belongs to Judge Merrick Garland. Last year you said you would keep the SCOTUS at 8 for
hey that reminds me of another SCOTUS opposition. Remember how Repubs turned on Merrick Garlands?! #fakeoutrage
We know
Dems dnw possible 5-4 rulings
@banyanjd Yes but it wasn't this job and he wasn't nominated by this president
@PolitiFact @SenateMajLdr hmmmm...appeals court vs Supreme Court.  Which potentially can be more damaging?  #obfuscation
@SenSchumer has went against every part of Bill of Rights
Strange...wasn't Garland similarly treated by GOP?  And yet GOP acted unethically in regards to Garland.
Almost the same was true in the case of Judge Garland, so, what's your point again?
So what?
10 years ago I wore a size 9 ...so what does this prove again?
That you eat a lot?
You're the one turning this political and insulted present Supreme Court Justices! You're a clown -
continue to stir the pot
@freedomcaucus these leftist clowns are obstructionist' traitors to we the people, our Constitution and our Country! The plague!
You're referring to Republicans full failure to have hearings for Garland right? Completely agree, it was obstructionist bs
So he actually got a hearing?  Must be nice.   Our SCOTUS nominee didn't get one.
.@SenTedCruz Republicans were OK with Merrick Garland before they were against him.  https://www.google.com/amp/amp.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/16/the_republicans_who_voted_for_merrick_garland_in_1997_are_against_him_now.html â€¦
the job trump don't.
Sir this isn't about party now! It's not about agenda. Please see what this madman is doing in White House. Any other man needs
I look forward to your continued use of politifact.
A different court appointment.
Really, Ted. You can't fathom the difference between SCOTUS and Circuit Court? Recuse yourself for lack of clarity.
Gorsuch can expect to be put through the ringer. He needs to watch every word that comes out of his mouth.
Merrick Garland
His name is Merrick Garland.
his name is illrelevant
Listening now.  Mr. Whitehouse didn't bring any real argument against Judge Gorsuch.
things and times have changed. America has changed. Get with the program
Continues to totally redeem himself #LionTed
Merrick Garland much?
Yes but the Democrats lost the election...now they are bitter. Sad times for American politics.
A lot can happen in ten years
ooooo but now he's completely different ... the flip flopping is insane
Let's remember the games you played with Garland's confirmation. I assure, Dems will oppose because of your behavior. #LyinTed
he wasnt up for SCOTUS in 2006....Remind us again how Merrick Garland nomination was held up by @GOP?  I will wait for an answer
True: Merrick Garland was not considered objectionable by Republicans just a couple years ago.
the halt on Garland was simply following the "Biden Rule"
Which wasn't actually a rule and would have still allowed the sitting pres to nominate. Nice try.
now it's all about revenge
Could you point out your problems with Merrick Garland?
he was appointed by Obama
I'm getting tired of this Russia bullshit!
