@SenTedCruz you want to deny people the freedom to choose if they believe this is right? #notachristiannation
@ZetaBoucher @SenTedCruz Pregnancy is the direct result of the right to choose. Sexual pleasure is not the greatest principle.
@DWinSTL @SenTedCruz what is the greatest principle
@ZetaBoucher @SenTedCruz Glorify God.
@DWinSTL @SenTedCruz this is not a christian nation
@ZetaBoucher @SenTedCruz Doesn't matter, and I wouldn't claim it as such. You asked what is the highest principle. I answered.
@DWinSTL @SenTedCruz that is your highest principle. Not the highest
@ZetaBoucher @SenTedCruz So. What is the highest principle?
@SenTedCruz If men could become pregnant, legal abortion would be a sacrament. STAY AWAY FROM WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE.
@PDonnellyAdams @SenTedCruz Well, I'm a woman and he has never tried to interfere with my health care. Obamacare did, though.
@KristiLuvsJesus @PDonnellyAdams @SenTedCruz Obamacare brought health care to millions who didn't have it before.  Are you THAT stupid?
@DJRMewzique @PDonnellyAdams @SenTedCruz And, Obamacare delayed a medical test, that I needed to have, and caused all kinds of havoc . . .
@KristiLuvsJesus @PDonnellyAdams @SenTedCruz So, your delay is more important than the millions who  finally have health care?  #Selfish
@DJRMewzique @PDonnellyAdams @SenTedCruz I'm among "the millions who finally have health care".
@DJRMewzique I blocked @KristiLuvsJesus because she's an idiot.
@SenTedCruz It's insanity 2 be cool w the baby chop shop!
@Bjams2am @KristiLuvsJesus @SenTedCruz Insanity is having the audacity to put women's rights into question. It's 2016, move the fuck on!
@DJRMewzique @KristiLuvsJesus @SenTedCruz So ur tellin God is 2016, move the fuck on? Dude I didn't write the commandments
@Bjams2am @KristiLuvsJesus @SenTedCruz Not sure what the commandments have to do with anything as religion is irrelevant to law. #WakeUp
@DJRMewzique @Bjams2am @SenTedCruz Which of The 10 Commandments is "irrelevant to law"??
@SenTedCruz I have lead a #prolife life in our #prochoice country. You can not force everyone to follow your beliefs.
@SenTedCruz the #pro-life campaign is built on lies and hatred of women. #stopthesham
@SenTedCruz US hasn't been free since 1973. Biologically life begins at conception. Legally when does murder begin? Do you plan to enforce?
@SenTedCruz When you have the babies, you get to make the decision. Restricting access to abortion doesn't save babies, it kills women.
@SenTedCruz do the right thing. Do not filibuster Obama nomination to replace Justice Scalia
@SenTedCruz @drginareghetti ALL BABIES ARE AGAINST ABORTIONS.
@SenTedCruz do not filibuster nomination to replace Scalia
@SenTedCruz THE CHILDREN OF HUMANS ARE NOT THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

@Trumps1stMember @SenTedCruz  JESUS LOVES YOU! TRUST HIM AS YOUR SAVIOUR!
@tsutherland690 @SenTedCruz how can we trust ted and savior at once. our lord said can only serve one master. you are a heretic
@Trumps1stMember @SenTedCruz  how do you trust a man who thinks he does not need to be forgiven, because he thinks he has never done

@itsmesteph11 @Trumps1stMember is a Progressive liberal;  and that is all need to know!
@SenTedCruz thanks
@SenTedCruz - but not the lives that would be ended by carpet bombing right? #bombyouifyoudontlooklikeme
@SenTedCruz Truth. The brain is important too. Sanity. Weird thing, without it, nothing matters.
@SenTedCruz keep your hateful religion out of our government. Separation of church and state!
@SenTedCruz You`re for real a scary mofo, abortion should be a woman`s choice !! Gift from God my ass 
@SenTedCruz. AMEN #SenatorTedCruz I THANK GOD HE sent @SenTedCruz as a Moses to lead this nation out of darkness.

@SenTedCruz Wise words from a wise man. #georgecarlin
Ain't free will a bitch? Crazy how some simply want you to live long enough to reach said free will.
@SenTedCruz How do you reconcile your death penalty position with Jesus's teachings of:"He who is without sin shall caste the first stone."
@insideyourfuego @SenTedCruz 2) in the civil society because of THEIR actions. Not anyone else's, but theirs. Consequences come with..
@SenTedCruz No one invited you into our uteruses. No one asked you to speak for the unborn. KEEP YOUR PAWS OFF.
@PDonnellyAdams @SenTedCruz You were once unborn who had no voice of your own. Your parents had to speak for you in making decisions.
@KristiLuvsJesus @SenTedCruz Only mom can speak for her unborn. No one else! That includes YOU.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump  I'll DARE you to use OUR GOD for PROMOTE your political gain!
@SenTedCruz but you don't seem to defend that life after it's born... Hmm
@SenTedCruz In Stickers We Trust #stickerfaceguy

@SenTedCruz With you there is no Liberty with Life!
@SenTedCruz @conens46 Without life there is no future generation to sustain, maintain, protect, or even run a nation.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz that is great, but do believe a woman has to carry a rapists baby or a baby created by incest?  Leave our bodies alone.
@SenTedCruz I believe men should be able to legally "abort" the baby to the mother and skip out on paying child support
@SenTedCruz stop!!! Cut it out!
@SenTedCruz In parts of central America, women who seek abortions are sentenced to jail.  Would you do that?
@SenTedCruz if my uterus was a gun you wouldn't legislate it .
@SenTedCruz Yes
@SenTedCruz God bless you my friend! We are praying for you!
@SenTedCruz Your a good man Sen Cruz. Be mindful of the race and how its run
@SenTedCruz How can you be pro-life AND pro-gun at the same time? You CAN'T.
@SenTedCruz I am for you sir and praying for you daily. I am thankful for men like you who are fighting for Liberty.
@SenTedCruz Guns have an amazing knack of taking lives away don't you think. #nomoreguns #guncontrolinUSA
@SenTedCruz Agreed. Why is that life less important after birth? #schoollunchprogram #healthcare #minwageincrease #preKed
@SenTedCruz why take part displaying re-displayed their controversial “snaketivity” on the same Capitol lawn.
@SenTedCruz Without Cruz, there's less hypocrisy in Washington DC
@SenTedCruz  Every life is precious and your right it is a gift from God!!
@SenTedCruz @ash@Anthony prison thank u I hope my rights count to you.
