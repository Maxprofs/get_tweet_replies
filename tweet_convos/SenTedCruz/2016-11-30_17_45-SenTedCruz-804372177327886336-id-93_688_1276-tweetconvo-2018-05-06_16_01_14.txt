The law of the Lord supersedes the law of TX. Exodus 22:21
Austin, Houston , Dallas need cleaned out. It is,really sad our captial city is sanctuary city.
Your lack of education is showing! @GregAbbott_TX
I see the diaper pen say no more.
AGAIN, your lack of education is showing!!!
go to your safe space. Better yet Cuba is more to your liking. It has ocean fronts on all sides.
Now why would I go to Cuba? Why is being on an island so bad?! Maybe if you got out a little you might OPEN YOUR MIND!
my mind is open and sees more than you know. Get some real education life. Collage was good life learns. Why not use real name
I have plenty real life education and advanced COLLEGE degrees to boot! I use the safety pin & pseudonym for effect!
@Speshlk0510 That goes for New York too.
.@GregAbbott_TX How will Texas choose to show compassion to those displaced by violence and unstable economies in Central America?
Can federal government legally withhold funds to sanctuary cities? Would it go before SCOTUS? Proud of u & proud to be Texan
yes they can for going against federal law. Once Trump is in office he can insist immigration laws be followed
wow!  Boom!  Mic drop...A very well written, concise article that should be simple enough for all to understand.
how any when I was physically assaulted by Brent buscher a Toyota Texas mgr?
This is fantastic for your residents. Any chance you can talk some sense into Colorado? I'm embarrassed of these people.
you andme both Deb
Tell POETUS to follow the law. Divest and stop calling dictators.
unless you want to be seen as a traitor to your own country there are no sanctuary cities in America.
@RepublicofTrump stand strong
Too bad you couldn't take this hard stance with the TEA criminally robbing  millions of disabled kids out of an education
@SenTedCruz I admire you Governor you are doing right thing
Period!
When will we have the opportunity to retire you?
Thank you @GregAbbott_TX
kkk evil
evil racist nazy kkk
@SenTedCruz @GregAbbott_TX Is that why Houston is one of the biggest sanctuary cities and a huge problem?
you seem nice. Move while you can, people.

this country was founded on breaking the law, so with all due respect, shove it.
no sanctuary colleges and universities
Thank U Governor! U are the best Governor & hope 2C u run 4 POTUS after 8 years w/ @realDonaldTrump
Presidency one day, sir? You are fearless, regarding doing the right thing, as well as a blend of common sense & smarts.
@SenTedCruz common sense. All states should follow
@SenTedCruz Unless it becomes constitutional to demand ID upon request, all cities are sanctuary cities
How are you exempt from this? Levitcus 19:34 Matthew 5:43-44 Hebrew's 13:1 Matthew 25:35 Romans 12:13 #WWJD
Oil Construction and Agricultural. No longer hide their hiring of Undocs. Btw how can Undocs steal jobs and drain resources?
Texas Businesses are giving jobs to Undocs but ONLY the Undoc is the criminal? When will you point the finger at them?
1/3 Follow the law in Texas? How about closing businesses Hiring Undocs. Hiring the Undocumented is against the Law.
how very Christian of you. 
Exactly!
The "sanctuary cities" have not worked out to well in the UK https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2300355/one-in-three-babies-born-in-uk-last-year-had-foreign-parent-compared-to-just-one-in-five-in-2000/ …
TABC and FOOD HANDLErS permits are handed to ILEGALS by the state can you do something about it
Best Governor ever!!
all you care about is money and white constituents
So I guess your economy will go down because you have many farm workers who are Latino. You are a racist Governor
You will be ousted by demographic changes.
.@GregAbbott_TX I have an announcement to make: Eg Grabbott.
Editorial: Follow the law in Texas. No sanctuary cities. Period. #tcot #txlege  http://m.amarillo.com/opinion/editorial/2016-11-30/editorial-follow-law-texas#gsc.tab=0 …
Rule of Law = Liberty.  Rule of man = tyranny.  God is the Author of Law.  Man is the author of chaos and confusion.  #Truth
yeah, good luck with that.
you're a monster
Imitate Jesus, or stop pretending that you are a Christian.
you haven't or backed up your words yet. Like when you promised help to the Ellis County Tornado Vics. 12-26-2016

I agree and make your voice heard
god bless you sir. Thanks for caring about Texans.
@UnitedCitizen01 Thank you Governor!
.@GregAbbott_TX The federal govt is a significantly larger threat to the sovereignty of the great state of TX than any undocumented person
The govt closest to the people governs best. You are for limited govt. Let cities choose what works best for them.
the Capitol of the great lone star being a sanctuary.
there are churches in Austin that hide and protect illegals and encourage them to come illegally
Newly elected officials in Houston said they would not follow the law. Ed Gonzalez and Chief Art Acevedo = sanctuary Houston.
CLOSE THE JIHAD CAMPS IN KATY, ARLINGTON AND RICHARDSON.
No Federal funding to all making safe harbor for illegals: churches, politicians, landlords, employers, legal aid, the ACLU
amen
legalize weed already, brochacho. Get Texas into the 21st century. Let's get that tax $$.
You would have kicked your wife's family out?

You are a true patriot god bless the usa.
@dougducey when is the Arizona media going to stand up & be counted? @greenvalleynews @nogalesinternational @AzCapitolTimes

Thank you from your fellow Texan!!
Thank you Gov. Abbott we appreciate and what you are doing. We pray for you.
Amen!
God bless sanctuary cities!  Stand up to these racist, UNCHRISTIAN policies that tear families apart. U make me proud t b Txn
Need details how enforced, penalties, who goes to jail, for how long? @GregAbbott_TX Is there a jail big enough for Austin, Dallas, Houston?
 #GodBlessTexas
