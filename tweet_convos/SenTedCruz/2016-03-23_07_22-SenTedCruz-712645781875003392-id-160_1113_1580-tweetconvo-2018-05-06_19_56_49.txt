@SenTedCruz @POTUS your writers need to do more research . They're making you look stupid. Not giving them all the credit though ;-)
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Link that is not a post of yours.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS this coming from the Cruz family, that believes the Pope is the Antichrist and us Catholics are going to hell. Rich.
@SenTedCruz don't give up! Stay strong ! The USA needs you 
@SenTedCruz @Ptab01 There are some really mean nuns out there. #justsaying
@Tdanielwright @SenTedCruz That was the old Skool - Nuns r very sweet since disarming of rulers & yardstix
@SenTedCruz @POTUS    Litigating is a court matter for the State ! Not a prayer matter for God !  Facts determine wrong !
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Are you really concerned with the nun voting base?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS None is the proper word for nuns. Read about the history of nuns and priests.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS This is what you call evil to the core of being
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Let the nuns do as they wish, just don't allow them government money or tax breaks either. You don't get it both ways.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama he forgot that narco terrorist FARC kidnapped dozens of Americans and are a major drug cartel in the world.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS didn't you tell the pope he should stay out of politics? What's the difference? Answer please
@SenTedCruz @POTUS No, bozo Ted. the nuns are litigating against the United States b/c they're too stupid to fill out a form.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS if you end up getting nominated over Trump, you're destroying the Republican party!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Not necessarily. Maybe you should include information in your tweet. I don't understand you sometimes. Link it somehow!!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Trump is right about one thing only! You Cruz are a liar! Spreading bad rumors to get what you want! Not POTUS material!
@SenTedCruz President Donald J Trump the true patriot running for POTUS  @POTUS

@SenTedCruz @POTUS
amen brother @SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUSNot if Nuns are putting religion against human rights which should become first!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Surely it's the other way round? Why should nuns be treated any differently than the rest of us?
@SenTedCruz, if you fail to value women's rights and well being, you're probably doing something wrong.
@SenTedCruz @bcwilliams92 @POTUS Love Trump agree on the nuns
@SenTedCruz @BayStateBelle @POTUS I bet he and liberals probably wouldn't do that to a Group like CAIR
@SenTedCruz @crazygranny56 @POTUS he's traveling the road of perceived least resistance trying to defeat tenants of Christianity. Pathetic.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Not all Republicans are religious fanatics like yourself! Didn't you say atheists had no place in your America? Hypocrite
@SenTedCruz @POTUS And a Muzzie!

@SenTedCruz @YTM1staWu1fy @POTUS Ted Cruz if you are marrying establishment women who work for goldman sachs, you are doing something wrong.
@DasAxiom @SenTedCruz @POTUS is she hot though?
@YTM1staWu1fy @SenTedCruz @POTUS No she looks like wilderbeast.
@DasAxiom @SenTedCruz @POTUS disappointed
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Hey Ted Bush!! I'm not sure if I told you lately, you are a disgrace!! Please go back to Canada or wherever!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Hold steady. Law enforcement in any community is a welcomed sight by law-abiding citizens.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS This doesn't make sense to some. Go figure.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Check out @gqforbes's Tweet: https://twitter.com/gqforbes/status/712462431763734528?s=09 …
@SenTedCruz No birth control. You must have you head stuck in the sand.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS looking like a vote for you is a vote for the establishment based on your latest endorsements who would have thought
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz I know Soros is paying you & Kasich to stay in the race for a BROKERED CONVENTION GRAB.God is Omnipresent, DROP OUT
@SenTedCruz fucking christ you're disgusting looking, I understand why your daughter hates your touch
@SenTedCruz let's start a patrol for dumbfucks like you, you fucking idiot
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Can't be the same Nuns from "The History of the World, Pt. 1," featuring Mel Brooks.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 

Truth.
@Blob_Fish @SenTedCruz @POTUS @PolitiFact Politifact blows it again.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Ukraine?wprov=sfla1 …
@Blob_Fish @SenTedCruz @POTUS @PolitiFact If you do your research you will find politifact has it wrong, as they often do. That's a fact!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 
Sounds like a comedy line.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Nice try Senator.  If you were schooled by Nuns you would't be lyin Cruz.
@SenTedCruz, if you're pretending Christians are persecuted when they make up 70.6% of the population, you're probably doing something wrong
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Perhaps Christian Scientists,who believe in no medical care, should file suit and destroy health insurance for believers
@SenTedCruz @POTUS freedom of religion means they can morally object, but they can NOT force those beliefs on others.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS if your Super Pacs continue to attack Melania, then we'll start attacking Heidi as a globalist
@JSmith2o10 @SenTedCruz @POTUS Oh, please do, I would love for everyone to see the Alex Jones conspiracies come out of the Trump camp.
@ReviveLibrty @SenTedCruz @POTUS there's plenty of legitimate material as seen in Building A North American Commumity. No thanks.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Mr. Cruz, as a former catholic I'll tell you this little secret:

Nuns can be as corrupt and evil as anyone else.
Yep @SenTedCruz, Ted Cruz trades #2 in GOP field last hour in Twitter discussions https://goo.gl/d98cj2  #cruzcrew
@SenTedCruz and if you degrade someone's wife then I guess you're doing something wrong
@SenTedCruz MrCRUZ You can't never be a President Of United States Of America.Your Elite (Freemason ) Agenda is already expose to Americans.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Unless the nuns are trying to deny employees health care.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS what up with this Ted?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS or handing nukes to Iran or letting ISIS in America.
@SenTedCruz @CatholicClassy @POTUS Technically not Nuns: They are Religious Sisters. But I'll let it slide this time.
@SenTedCruz you speak so much of religious liberty and freedom. But only for Christians. You seek to persecute peaceful Muslims.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Nuns are kind of mean sometimes, Raphael.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump , you are EVIL #LyingTed , how could you be responsible, or stoop so low to post Malania in that light! Shame
@SenTedCruz @POTUS If they have broke the law. then they are just people. (magic is not real)
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS If you are posting modeling pic of your opponents wife in a neg way you are probably doing something wrong.,
@SenTedCruz @POTUS He NEVER goes after muslims, ever.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Probably?Obozo has illegally superseded mandated Roman Catholic precepts protected-religious freedom.Left agenda must go
@SenTedCruz If you're evaluating litigants based on their religious vows, you're probably misunderstanding the role of courts.
@SenTedCruz ur still probably worse than @JebBush #TheAdventuresofFlappyTrump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Actually with the Pope they have, gullible enough to believe climate change-have a problem with him having my eternity
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I-BO doesn't care, he's a A Muslim sympathizer. Seen his Muslim ISIS Bro lately? Seen the Christian blood bath lately
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Withdraw and take care of your family Teddy. They need you.Give up  the hate and lies and do what's right for everyone.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Count Chocula, given the Constitutional separation between church and state, THE PRESIDENT DID THE RIGHT THING. YOU ASS.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT TED CRUZ
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted, are you running against President Obama? Reflect on what I wrote, and refocus your energy to fight off Trump.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Amen!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted, Your trying to use religion as your stepping stone.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS what does @realDonaldTrump  have against ur wife?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz using trumps wife the same lady that was kind to your girls is a low blow grow a pair act like a real man.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Remember God will be watching and he does not forget!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS outrageous.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS The Tea Party darling isn't doing as well as he wants Projected the winner by the base B careful what U say to Trump
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted Cruz will be a President we can be proud of and know he will always do the right thing
@HomenSherry @SenTedCruz @POTUS except when he's nailing prostitutes or destroying the economy with his regressive plans
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 

Oh please. I don't exactly see you fighting for nuns on a bus.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS maybe we shud patrol and monitor the convents bc u never can b 2 shur #GOP #TedCruz #safety #SaveTheLions
@SenTedCruz @POTUS understand why DC doesn't like you ,you rely on lies dirty tricks to deceive you have no honor or ethics fake Christian
@SenTedCruz  people like you are the reason why child molesting priest aren't in prison. The bibles are books, not get out of jail free card
@SenTedCruz @POTUS He is a Muslim!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS the teleprompter jesus hangs out with dictators ... i'm sure he sees nothing wrong w litigating against nuns ...
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Mr. Senator, if you think nuns are the paragon or virtue and morality, you're probably mistaken
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS oh right nuns don't have to follow laws. No wonder they get to drive thru red lights
@rcpickett72 As followers of God and siblings of Christ they must obey the law but not if it goes against God.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Hey those may very well be some radical conservative nuns!
@SenTedCruz Big words from a creep with a hooker problem. #CreepyCruz #DominionistLoon #SenPaisleyBathrobe
@SenTedCruz right, b/c the catholic church has never done anything wrong...
@SenTedCruz @POTUS yo Teddy boy, last time I checked Obama isn't running
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
