.@POTUS’ action is a brazen violation of federal law & the Constitution’s separation of powers - http://1.usa.gov/1RJxk6J 
@SenTedCruz @JackBlaine3 congress should have impeached this president
@mkues65 @SenTedCruz  Morally yes, politically no.
@JackBlaine3 @SenTedCruz they allowed him to usurp the constitution several times
@mkues65 @SenTedCruz  Republicans don't have the political heart for it, but then what do they have the heart for?
@JackBlaine3 @SenTedCruz they actually have done much except approve the dangerous Iran Treaty & TPP etc
@mkues65 @SenTedCruz  The Dems & Reps are all one entity about now. They have each others back protecting their personal wealth and power.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS except when it was Reagan https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act_of_1986 …
@dhambrick63 @SenTedCruz @POTUS that was Congress, not Reagan.
@jimlear @SenTedCruz @POTUS Congress let him. Approval through inaction
@dhambrick63 @SenTedCruz @POTUS ?? It was an act of Congress providing legal status to immigrants. Reagan signed & followed law.
@dhambrick63 @SenTedCruz @POTUS I can't comment on Reagan's motivation. He followed the law and Obama has not.

@SenTedCruz That's hypocritical coming from someone who gave illegal alien children gifts after they got here.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz Talk to the farmers and those in the construction industry including in Texas and find out why they 'employ' the illegals.
@SenTedCruz It was congress inaction. POTUS invoked the constitution and gave amnesty. The illegals are there because they are needed.
