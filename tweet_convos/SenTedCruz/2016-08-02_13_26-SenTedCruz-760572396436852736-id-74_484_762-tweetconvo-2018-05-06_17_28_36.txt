Obama Surrenders Control of the Internet  http://nws.mx/2acroZA 
there go those liberals again. Money over Liberty!
money or Liberty? Because if you think you're free then you're mistaken.
then you don't pay taxes!
so you don’t mind have a price put on your labor?
Sorry.  You let alot of people down.  Including me.  You committed political suicide.  You're over.  And irrelevant
he did not let me down. He did exactly what I would've done.
Only it's not protecting any freedoms. It's doing the exact opposite. It's giving Internet companies rights to charge more.
government doesn't give rights. I'm wasting my time.
Cruz just wants to make profits for his donors. Money and power is all he's interested in.
you should have lost gracefully and supported Trump. I don't know a soul that will ever vote for you again. I know I won't .
@newsmax If Hillary gets in, US will become an islamic HELL she will LORD over. #StopHillary & her MURDERS!

@newsmax 

You really think people are dumb,  don't you?
@k_winters1 @newsmax Until people start voting #Libertarian and stop voting for Progressives & Rinos, this'll continue to happen
Worry more about protecting Internet access by letting stand FCC ruling on Net Neutrality.
I voted for you. I think it was terrible you didn't back the GOP nominee. R party is killing itself from within and ur  no help
@ramrants There is nothing to protect. No laws or acts to be amended later. Nothing. #GetLost #NoGovtBS
@newsmax Pants On Fire
Protect our internet freedom for the UN.
@newsmax seriously where else are we gonna get porn? Lol #SorryNotSorry
@newsmax Will the rest of Congress get some balls? No evidence yet of that happening

Don't worry the #NeverTrump's will allow it to be controlled by Hillary's administration... good plan guys.
#WriteInCruz the only person who will stand strong with principles to protect our #liberty.

@newsmax I don't agree with you on most things but I am with you o this Sen Cruz.
Vote Your Conscience! Johnson & weld 2016.   http://johnsonweld.com 
@newsmax go home cruz
@newsmax 
Ted, it's time you figure it out that it's all over for you in politics.  You will not be re elected in Texas.
I ask this as someone who CHOSE to become an American and wants the best for my new homeland, no matter the party affiliation.
no one cares what you have to say anymore
Senator I wonder what you think of the #TeamGov ticket. If Johnson does the impossible, would you encourage House to elect him?
@newsmax Republicans are getting creamed by the truth of social media. Their real goal is to censure information.Truth hurts!
Oh thank god you linked to newsmaxx I was running out of seed packs.
@newsmax Thank you for all you do!! #welovesenatorcruz!!!!!
@newsmax why would anyone be so stupid to post personal info in the first place?
@newsmax More government control.
@newsmax you really think Obama is your focus? There is a nut in charge of your party and you're worried about the ex president?
I have not gone back on facebook since you will never see me on facebook again truth, thanks for caring sir
facebook now forces you to show proof when you change your screename of who you are by attaching email, or something on line
Net Neutrality is the only thing that matters
mr cruz..I was on facebook, and I wanted my screename to be something other then my real name..facebook now forces you to show
