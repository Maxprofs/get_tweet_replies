@SenTedCruz  Obama has a sick mental disorder and arrogantly disregards our security.
@SenTedCruz Bill Ayers and Obama are cut from the same cookie cutter.. It's very disturbing..Bill Ayers is behind #blacklivesmatter radicals
@SenTedCruz Obama is a "citizen of the World" in his mind.. he's spreading our wealth for 3rd World countries.. BLM, Palestine Radical commi
@SenTedCruz ISIS is playing the liberal media like a cheap violin....and the media thinks it's being empathetic. I fear low-info ppl now.

@SenTedCruz And he now wants to go after law abiding citizens guns. $ going to fight against gun grabbers doesn't go to republican campaigns
@SenTedCruz @NightShiftNews we knew how stupid he was
@SenTedCruz you will say anything to pander to your evangelical crowd. You sir are a puppet.
@SenTedCruz Unfortunately BHO is most clearly focused on national security interests. Make no mistake about it-he has a plan.
@SenTedCruz And you Rafael, lack an IQ.
@SenTedCruz why won't anybody dare say it's intentional instead of always saying things like "lacks focus"? His actions&inactionsRpurposeful
@SenTedCruz pretending as though Paris is on American soil.
@SenTedCruz Ted, this admin doesn't give a rat's ass about national security interests except where it advances their political agenda
@SenTedCruz why don't you say that to his face????#canadiancoward
@SenTedCruz lacked interest implies he had interest. Your from TX. so you understand he needs to grow a set.
@SenTedCruz  Obama's actions R DELIBERATE! Only after ppl realize this disheartening fact,can he be stopped! He's destroying us from within!
@SenTedCruz at 5% America has has clearly lacks focus on your campaign
@SenTedCruz "Lacked focus" would not be how I would describe it. It is FUBAR. Almost as if it was willfully screwed up.
@SenTedCruz why would he be worried about your native land of Canada? No more foreigners in the White House. Time for a true American POTUS.
@SenTedCruz The President's lack of focus on national security will be his legacy. He chooses not to protect Americans.
@SenTedCruz or theyre in cahoots and playing dumb keeps him above reproach
@SenTedCruz we know why
@SenTedCruz @Fitzzer777 no one in their right mind would allow this to go on
@SenTedCruz i agree, he should send you back!
@SenTedCruz He has focus - it's just not on invading every country you chickenhawks want him to.
@SenTedCruz or is it an agenda?
@SenTedCruz 

he's one of them.
@SenTedCruz He has since day one.
