Yes, they are too!  Good thing they aren't worldwide like the islamic terrorists.
well, I agree. We should seriously consider designating leftists, liberals, #blm, #nbp as terrorists as well.
PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN.
No, it was very conservative of him.
Waste of time Senator - The world says they are
The liberals don't acknowledge that.
I am a liberal, I have acknowledged it for years
you're my hero. I hope to be as virtuous a man as you one day Senator! # I voted for you #cruzcontrol
Their new leader will be Hillary if you don't get GOP in the WH!
@EdWebrity you are a narrow minded bigot and that is why you are not the candidate and we have the train wreck we have
-Actually, you're the name calling, angry one who cannot articulate a single logical point of view.
@EdWebrity  your just as bad as he is and your little marco too.
thank you, but that would include a few of our current US politicians, and their advisors won't  it?
Thank you Ted for your outstanding work on those hearings!
@easyhandoff good
@Gas8128 Good luck with that, they happen to be @POTUS & @HillaryClinton 's best buds.
@RestoreHistory thank you sir!
@RestoreHistory Ok, but it is now July. Repubs have majority. What happened? Oh wait, let me guess, RINO @SenateMajLdr nixed it.
@RestoreHistory Don't forget CAIR ! They are the suited up driving force of terrorism. They should be banned here in the USA.
@RestoreHistory Thank you.  I'm glad you're back to being a Senator; this is what you're good at. #RockOn
How many bills have you introduced 4 Healthcare Vouchers 4 our dying Veterans TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz ? How many soccer balls to illegals
too little too late. Your credibility is shot just like @marcorubio and @JebBush
@vonzion thanks Ted
So that makes Huma Abedin have Terrorist Ties...
how about doing your job and skip the symbolic distractions?
@CathyTo47590555 seriously? We need lyin Ted to define Islamic Extremism? No wonder you got blown away. #Trump2016 
Thank you for doing so Ted Cruz!  Keep fighting!  God bless you!
and I 110% support this bill, get'em ted.
@PaveDarker  That wasn't a bill brought forward in the Canadian Parliament.
@SenTedCruz
So many tweets today!  You hoping to grab the nomination at the contested GOP convention?
This would have created more radicals... along with all of your other shitty ideas. You lack good ideas
No way Obama will sign that.  They are his BFF's
You really are evil incarnated. You are worse than Trump. You frighten humans. You're the bump under the bed at night.
tear them up cruz. make them understand u r there to help American from terrorist acts.
The dems don't care.  Get behind Trump.
that's OK, just make sure they can still buy guns! #sarcasm
In the big pic MB is not a big factor except for Egypt and they are handling it with force
CAIR should be next. Why do both groups have so much access to the WH and why are MB people in US government positions
@GaetaSusan dot tell that to Paul Ryan and obama!
republicans are a terrorist organization to the common good for working people of America.
yet GOP ignores Zika thus hurting American women
DESTROY, not "designate".
@Stand4Liberty_ You are talking again and what, pray, has been DONE? We want doers not talkers.
ISLAM, NAZIS, KKK ALL = HATRED, pure and simple. Although I will say,  it is the followers of Islam doing the killing today
.@SenTedCruz Congrats? Surprised you were able to Tweet this while so vigorously patting yourself on the back.
doing the tough work, NOT!
no one cares. Support Trump. Help take our Country back!
Senator, return to the presidential race! Let God use your life to bless the Americans.
congratulations, very meaningful bill.   What to call something.  Introduce a bill designating you as useless.
Get behind Trump 100% are just going away.
Those in Washington say they did this and they did that but nothing ever gets done.This Nov the people are throwing everyone out
Now introduce a bill that seeks to keep mentally ill people from being able to hose down a movie theater with a gun.
Senator. is this not unnecessary grouping. Does it not risk creating enemies from moderates?
I like you because you are not a coward and have morals andvalues ourcountry needs. Thanks4recognizing that brotherhood as it is
Amen.

guess who was uber supportive of #MuslimBrotherhood? #Obama backing #Morsi do we now as Americans see what we have in the #WH
#TedCruzforPresident2016
Oh gosh that's important. LOL
It won't pass with Obama in office.
