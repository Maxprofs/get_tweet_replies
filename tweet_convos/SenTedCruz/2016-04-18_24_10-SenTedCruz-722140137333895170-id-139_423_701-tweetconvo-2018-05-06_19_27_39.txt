@SenTedCruz @POTUS Wait a second. Aren't you circumventing the voters in this election? What's the difference?
@AmericanAsPie @SenTedCruz @POTUS for starters, president takes an oath to defend constitution. Parties are private entities. Make sense?
@Adam00xl @SenTedCruz @POTUS Just pointing out a hypocrisy in the statement. But thanks for telling me what I already know.
@AmericanAsPie @SenTedCruz @POTUS hey, you asked. Nothing hypocritical about wanting constitution upheld instead of undermined.
@Adam00xl @SenTedCruz @POTUS Well, maybe we can get another 18 hour filibuster and "Green Eggs and Ham" to stop the lawless president.
@AmericanAsPie @SenTedCruz @POTUS Hehe, if that's what it takes, I'm sure Cruz will oblige. #Cruzing
@Adam00xl @SenTedCruz @POTUS and he'll come to the same result as his campaign. Failure. You Cruz you lose.
@AmericanAsPie @SenTedCruz Hehe, that's clever. I disagree of course, but appreciate the wit. Keep up the fight against libs/progressives!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS And you have a Constitutional duty to #DoYourJob and consider his judicial nominee
@Bruiser4Eq @SenTedCruz @POTUS nope...  obama has not nominated with advice and consent of senate.... NO... obama's move still.
@docwhocuts @SenTedCruz @POTUS has nominated, as required by the Constitution. Where is the advice and consent (or even dissent)?
@Bruiser4Eq @SenTedCruz @POTUS he's supposed to nominate WITH consent and advice from senate....   he NEVER passed go.  I win
.@docwhocuts @SenTedCruz @POTUS Maybe try reading the Constitution? The *appointment* is with advice & consent, not the nomination. You lose
@Bruiser4Eq @SenTedCruz @POTUS why were you using nomination terminology prior then?  oh, you just looked it up... YOU'RE LESS THAN I.
@docwhocuts @SenTedCruz @POTUS Now you're just making stuff up to save face. Buh bye!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS he also has responsibility to nominate a Supreme Court Justice!
@adman1956 @SenTedCruz @POTUS only with advice and consent of senate.... of which obama has sought zero.  BAMN, end of that garbage.
@docwhocuts @adman1956 @SenTedCruz @POTUS He has..BAM, end of your garbage..
@docwhocuts @adman1956 @SenTedCruz @POTUS  Shame on you.. Cruz is a lose just like you.
@SenTedCruz @LOVEINE @POTUS HOW about UNSEALING your IMMIGRATION Recods! Canada & USA!http://running2016.com/html/canadian_ted.html â€¦
@SenTedCruz @LOVEINE @POTUS #ConstitutionFirst.   America is just another country without it!
@SenTedCruz @COCrowe @POTUS Hey Ted winning isnt having delegates selecting you VS the Will of the people with no VOTER participation
.@PAINSCOURT We have an Electoral College. Candidates are nominated by delegates, look it up. @SenTedCruz
@COCrowe @SenTedCruz A system that continually changes its rules is fraudulent,   i.e Rule 40 B invented for Dr.Ron Paul
.@PAINSCOURT Rules, like laws are dynamic, constantly changing. @SenTedCruz
@COCrowe @SenTedCruz Changing rules guarantees party control simple equation,care 2 continually change rules N the middle of a football game
.@PAINSCOURT The RNC convention has yet to begin. Each State has their own election laws. Want some cheese? @SenTedCruz
@COCrowe @SenTedCruz Its in the best interest of a ethical election to have stable rules not evolving rules in order to maintain control
.@PAINSCOURT Are you worried about the R party? I say let them make their bed & fail. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 
You of all people saying something like that. You and your entire family has been lying about your citizenship for years
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Ted lies, & cheats his way through this campaign
@Patriot_in_CA @SenTedCruz @POTUS Unfortunately that will be Rotten-Clinton in January after she kicks Donald's ass!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS hey Ted I heard Joe the plumber announced his running mate too! The Tidy  Bowl guy! Cool huh?
@POTUSllegal immigrant households receive avg of $5,692 in federal welfare benefits/yr. Avg "native" American household $4,431!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS where's your constitutional duty when I it comes to supreme Court nomination?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Lyin' Ted, who are you fooling? You're not going to deport the illegals. You'll be a disaster for America.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  He didn't
@SenTedCruz @MayIrmamay14 @POTUS That is, of course, assuming the 'P' in POTUS means 'president'...not puppet, prevaricator or putz
@SenTedCruz @POTUS They shouldn't give out soccer balls and baby dolls to illegals crossing the border, either.
@SenTedCruz Constitution doesnt delegate fed govt power over immigration, only over naturalization #LyinTed strikes again @POTUS GREAT Job
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Congress has a fiduciary duty to establish immigration policy, and should reduce all immigration to 250,000 per year!
@SenTedCruz @prissygurld @POTUS Exactly the point Donald Trump starts saying last summer. Eventually, it seems, others get on board.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS That's too funny. Congress has a Constitutional duty to hold a vote on SCJ nominee.  Now you know why ur party is a joke
@SenTedCruz @POTUS hopefully it would have kept u in Canada and your fake pastor dad in Cuba
@SenTedCruz SO JUST WHY ARE YOU CIRCUMVENTING VOTERS ACROSS AMERICA? Try to be honest for once! @mitchellvii @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz @POTUS ..TIME TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE... PEOPLE OF AMERICA  HAVE CHOSEN WITH THERE VOTES. NOT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT RNC.!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Potus = popo tutus. The clown who laughed throughout Russia ! (And French too !)
@SenTedCruz @POTUS after last night what u said in the past about NY came back to bite you! NY don't play around!  Go home to Texas!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and to conform to the natural born citizen provision of the Constitution
@SenTedCruz @POTUS potus shouldn't whine about how hard it is to run for potus.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you are a false prophet, but to understand the constitution you do not! Do you teach constitutional law? No!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Teddy, what about your constitutional duty to vote on POTUS nomination for SCOTUS.  You are the worst kind of hypocrite.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Some Supreme Court Justice's have forgotten that Lady Liberty is Blind. Uphold the Laws, not rewrite them. hint; Obama
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and Congress has the constitutional duty to affirm the Supreme court justice not deny on "principle." checkmate.
-IGMA
@SenTedCruz @POTUS TRUMP 2016!! #whenyoucruzyoulose.
@SenTedCruz stop lyinTed, u kno u on board wit outta control immigration, u support amnesty, an increase n HB-1 u support da NAU, just stop
@SenTedCruz @POTUS the citizens get nothing they steal all the jobs,  decline us while in control, remain invisible w/ negative decisions
@SenTedCruz @POTUS only to benefit the non citizens for they attempt in anyway to manipulate and undermine our economy for their own
@SenTedCruz @POTUS unit the immigration laws are backfiring against the honest and faithful citizens of that country.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS It seems simple to me.  An Executive Order to abolish existing law is out of line.  Why the controversy?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS there should a Teddy baby shutdown. If stupid congress doesn't act??
@SenTedCruz Hmm, just like Senators have a constitutional duty to #DoYourJob and hold the hearings on the @POTUS @SCOTUSnom
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 
U are just like all the other politicians. U will say anything to get elected. I don't believe u or anyone in gov.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS He also had the duty to pick a new supreme court justice but that didn't matter to the establishment!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS & you have a constitutional duty to show up to vote. #TypicalPolitician #AllTalkNoWalk #CruzMeetDCOffice
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Shut up in the name of Jesus
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Like you and Mitch McConnell and the other unconstitutional Republicans refuse to consider his nomination for @Scotus ?
.@SenTedCruz Senate clearly has constitutiona duty to consider @POTUS's nominees. Executive agencies have wide discretion in enforcement.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS And Whining Donald needs to wipe the tears and do a little presidential work of learning the game.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Beat Trump before you step to POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS #doyourjob #kochbtotherspuppet
@SenTedCruz @POTUS HE HAS BEEN DEPORTING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS! GOP SENATORS ARE NOT DOING THEIR  JOB!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS would this be like the republicans circumventing the Supreme Court nomination? Get over yourself
@SenTedCruz @POTUS #passabill
@SenTedCruz Not true lying Ted.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS sen ny has 667 medal of honor winners thats ny values sen. Ur state has 76 so dont tell us about values!

@SenTedCruz you have a constitutional duty to vote for a new supreme court nominee regardless of party hypocrite,duty is a two way street!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS empty words from the party not voting on SCOTUS.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS If only someone on Twitter had an IQ as high as yours maybe it would be worth reading! GO CRUZ!!!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Lying Ted stay off my tweeter
@SenTedCruz Your behavior with respect to delegate manipulation is very disappointing.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS since when has a constitutional duty stopped this administration from doing anything they want? #lawsareforpoorpeople

@SenTedCruz @POTUS He's ignored our laws for 7.5 years, Ted.  why would he change now ?  He won't, I guarantee it.  It's not his 'agenda'.
