You are being challenged next yr I don't vote for CRUEL  and Dishonest people. Lord I hope you lose your Senate seat next yr!
" Ted " Cruz was against the GOP repeal - and - place bill because it wasn't Fascist enough, and didn't hurt enough of the Middle Class !
Republicans should remind themselves that Senate Health Bill breaks all the promises they made abt what Obamacare repeal would accomplish.
Shredded tires for a playground....  get over it.
Does this mean that Satanists could do the same thing based on this interpretation?
I assume you support that as well.
ted cruz@ted cruz . org thanks for standing up for religion and also the kids you are amazing and awesome
It was a decision 2 accommodate the health & safety of children, not a Constitutional decision 2 support a religion that would B un American
Mistaking religious freedom for greed. Now who will deal with lawsuits when other sects claim discrimination? Let's see Ted .
GOP bill cuts spending on Medicaid by 26% by 2026. That's where the savings come from. Remember Trump promised no Medicaid cuts.
CBO on effect of Senate bill's high premiums and deductibles: "despite tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan"
Religious freedom is bigotry and discrimination,  cloaked is fancy words.
Vote No! This healthcare will leave my 4 children with out their mother! You @JohnCornyn will be to blame when I die because of this bill!
Churches shouldn't be connected to government at all.... dude that's what the 1st amendment says.....
Amicus? Really Ted.
Since when do we suddenly think gov should provide healthcare?  If we think that keep Obamacare.  We don't think that, repeal don't replace
Working peep buy insurance.Increase jobs less uninsured.Forget all this new medicaid.wont need it.
Only slugs who don't work or vote want expanded Medicaid.  Ignore them.  Repeal do not replace.  W/ good economy won't need Medicaid.
Good news thanks for your effort.
if churches can benefit from tax payer dollars it's time for churches to pay their tax share! Or are Churches going to be TAKERS????
It's about time Christin's win onr
@Scotus is hard at work!!
What about health care? You will fail the President again and again! Republicans senators always fail to deliver!
A playground?! Seriously Ted do your job.
Not quite sure how this is about religious freedom. It's about playground equipment.

I just took a dump that was smarter than you.
Thank you Senator #TedCruz from Missouri for Standing up for Religious freedom! GOD Bless ♡
Excellent.  Now they can pay taxes.  When will that start happening?
Where is the separation of church and state ?
"Blatant religious discrimination" Come on, Ted. This was about a playground. There wasn't a militia standing in front of a church. Lyin Ted
Just remember that religious freedom isn't just for "Lutherans" and will they let the public use the playground?
Yes, local and neighborhood children use the playground after school hours, evenings, weekends, and it was so stated in their application.
I commend them for that. BUT It's A way of pulling down wall between church and state? Would a mosque get same?  This leads to trouble.
Because it seems you're so much more concerned with Christian freedom..@SenTedCruz @tedcruz ????
Will Mosques get to have their playground expenses funded??
Will you also fund efforts from the church or Satan?
Can I have a choice in funding you're "religious freedom" like you're making the choice to force me?
Time to tax the churches. That would fund healthcare for everyone.
The AP: BREAKING: Congressional Budget Office sees 22 million more uninsured by 2026 under Senate health bill in latest hurdle for GOP.
I will NEVER vote for you again if the @SenateGOP doesn't have at least the Obamacare Individual and Employer mandates repealed NOW!
Does religious freedom mean all religion,are you ready to defend them?  This could be a can of worms for you and your "Christian" faith.
Love it
Ted Cruz you stand for nothing. What a slap in the face to #LGBTQ on #Equality day
Shame, yet again 
#PrideMonth #LoveIsLoveIsLove
So are they also not making cakes for people that are getting remarried? What about ones who have had affairs?
...oh..amen
So does this include non-Christian religions too? Careful what you wish for. Beto for senate. Texas deserves better than Cruz.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
How about getting on board with this health issue? We are really tired of this. Doing nothing will seriously damage our Republican party.

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
Proud to have joined an amicus brief defending religious freedom in Trinity Lutheran. Huge win for First Apes Amendment!  #MAGAA
Impale yourself on a dildo, Ted.
can this please lead us to the taxing of the Church? I, as a taxpayer, dont want my funds supporting Religion no matter what Religion it is

You don't have a right to government acknowledgement of your "marriage".
Please explain where I am wrong.
Outstanding!
