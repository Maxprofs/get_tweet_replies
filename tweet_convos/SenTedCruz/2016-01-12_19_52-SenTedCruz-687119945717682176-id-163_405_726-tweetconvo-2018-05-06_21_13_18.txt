@SenTedCruz @POTUS as the leader of Turkey said "islam is islam, there are no modifiers"  saying radical islam is like saying wet water
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Bush built Deasch. Why do you insist on calling them what they wish? You sound ridiculous
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 'Ted Cruz', does saying that destroy you? No, damn
@SenTedCruz @POTUS stop copying Trump ! It's pathetic!
@SenTedCruz What happens if he says the magic words?
@DoremusJ @SenTedCruz well then a news network will give trump credit for it. It is a retarded point. mentally challenged -if words matter.
@Panelshell @russmove @DoremusJ @SenTedCruz  
He has to appear tough on someone. He swung at Trump and alienated the biggest city in the US.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS No he didn't. He just didn't feed into it. Pay atten U may learn something. The loudest person in the Rm is the weakest
@bolkans1030 what's PC?
@bolkans1030 well I don't need political correctness. However a leader should have class, grace, & tact in conversation. Which he doesn't. 
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @POTUS Ted, I got your back and I'll vote for you but drop the "Islamic" argument.
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @POTUS They're associated w/ Islam like the KKK was associated w/ Christianity.
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @POTUS And we sure as hell don't need to name them to fight them
@SenTedCruz That's it Ted, keep up the politics of fear, it's "what you do best".
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @POTUS So, U refuse 2 say da words we as nation nid 2 hear? #ArrestObama 4 his crimes. #KateSteinle #BrianTerry
@SenTedCruz @KockaAnnette @POTUS Yes ...but I'll bet he knows that #trumplovespecker and says #trumplovespecker.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS So tell us; if POTUS says "Radical Islamic terrorist" will ISIS suddenly implode?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz is a radical right wing war monger, shut this blurter down.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @BraveLad what do you expect ...check his Birth Cert and parentage
@SenTedCruz @POTUS your point?
.@SenTedCruz @POTUS Because that term doesn’t mean jack shit. Just a way for you fear mongers to get some air time.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS THEY WILL BLOW UP IN SHAME
@SenTedCruz  @POTUS NO MATTER WHAT YOU CALL TERRORISTS, THEY ARE NOT ALL FROM ISLAM. THE PARIS ATTACKS WERE DONE BY FRENCH TERRORISTS.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Silly Cruz,, Obama DID, Why does the GOP Congress refuse 2 Vote 2 Authorize Military Force?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You're right he DID diminish the threat of ISIS.When U R very small minded&nsecure you want to labelOthers2MakeSelfBetter
@SenTedCruz @POTUS What's YOUR plan to destroy ISIS, Ted?
@SenTedCruz @CarlyFiorina @SarahPalinUSA @GOP U.S. is weaker, shrinking on global scale, heavily indebted, inmates r running the compound!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @Anton2060 @POTUS He was one of the pillars of ISIS
@SenTedCruz Actions speak louder than words, and your actions on gun control are pathetic.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you basically just said he weakened the threat of ISIS. Proof read homie
@SenTedCruz @GaetaSusan @POTUS his plan was if congress wanted to declare war on isil he wasnt going to.
@SenTedCruz @GaetaSusan @POTUS ...maybe he's being coy. 
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you sound like Trump now -/ #Trump2016
"OH NO! He said the words 'radical Islamic terrorism'! I'm meeeeeelting!!!" screamed al-Baghdadi. @SenTedCruz @POTUS
Seriously though: last night, @POTUS explained cogently and eloquently why he isn't blaming Islam. It was clearly lost on you. @SenTedCruz
@fawfulfan @IdahoRoadapple Obama didn't diminish threat of ISIS. Stated it isn't a threat to the country but to civilians unlike @SenTedCruz
He's right. Terrorists are only threats based on how they influence a country's behavior. @TPTidbits @IdahoRoadapple @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @POTUS nor did he mention radical Christians like you...
@SenTedCruz @POTUS asked for congress to authorize military force to combat Isis last night. You do know that right?
@SenTedCruz you have not defeated anyone
.@SenTedCruz Hey Ted, How are ya? shut the fuck up. ok?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you can't really be that slow Cruz , can you ? Hiding , no show at SOTU, backfired lol
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  biggest illusion of knowledge is not ignorance it's the illusion of knowledge and O'bama displayed it too us ounce again
@SenTedCruz ur just 2 self righteous & ignorant 2 understand! It's fine ur ability 2 be POTUS will figured out & u will b gone.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS first both r right, and Ted is so wound up about it because it's a religious ideology fight. Obama tackle isil just fine!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS More Americans killed by swordfish than ISIS last year. Your plan for eradicating this threat?
You are an oxymoron walking amongst us  @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz like seriously, he didn't even mention radical Christian terrorism either!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS please stop with the bullshit fighting. You are our leaders. Come together. Be better. Compromise
@SenTedCruz @POTUS there's a social paradigm shift happening and the people are not supporting another pointless war in the Middle East
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Should American's hate Canadians for you overthrowing the senate in 2014? #SorryTedCruzIsNotARealCanadianEither
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ala peanut butter n jelly sandwiches. Know your audience right. 10 yrs they will be old enough to vote n might remember.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I bet even Benedict Arnold's ghost was unsettled by the crap dished out at that SOTU..  #TheLiarInChief
@SenTedCruz @POTUS that's just one of the reasons I didn't watch tonight
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz:YOU propagate the message of ISIS & are a vehicle for their terror. How unpatriotic! You are NOT FIT TO LEAD THE USA
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Quit being a FEAR MONGER CRUZ; shameful patriot w/NO pride in security; Who do all other countries come to 4 help? & why?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I think you should practice running in Texas.
It is a big state..oops Alaska is larger and then 48 more!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Neither did he mention during his SOTU THAT WE HAVE 10 SAILORS IN IRANIAN CUSTODY OR THE 4 THAT WERE ALREADY THERE. WHY??
@SenTedCruz i would vote for you, but am afraid the courts would block it. So I have to vote for that trump fella
@SenTedCruz @POTUS biggest foreign policy achievement, giving Iran $150B and not getting one of our citizens in the deal. #traitorintheWH
.@SenTedCruz @gailtalk: Orthodox, not "Radical," Islamic, please.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS could we all get a copy of your list of words that must be spoken to please you?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I agree with you on this but not on anything else http://youtu.be/09sK8d4mzso . I love you
@SenTedCruz @evil_avatar @POTUS *ISIL
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama literally told the Muslim community to face its own problems head-on & w/o excuse in his last address to us fam wyd
@SenTedCruz @POTUS it's called not being scared. Try it sometime.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted - let it go. Really. Let that hate of a black man smarter than you go.  Really, Ted.  Let it go. #hatefulTed #SOTU
@SenTedCruz  You are more of a threat to US than ISIS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  he can't even say ISIS...
@SenTedCruz @POTUS At what point does delusion manifest itself as Mental Illness
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and you overstate it, far right wing terrorist attacks outnumber radical Islamic ones five to one in the US
@SenTedCruz have you not realized he won't say it because he won't give you the satisfaction
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Because that is ineffective. You say that like it actually helps fight terrorism
@SenTedCruz You are not a natural born citizen
@SenTedCruz @POTUS "our war is not against Islam, or against Muslim people's faith. Our war is a war against evil," Bush January 2002.
@SenTedCruz I used to think he and his ilk were ideologues people hell bent on reshaping America. I was wrong they are just spineless wimps
@SenTedCruz @POTUS No need to because these ppl are just "thugs and killers"! Who don't represent Islam principles!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Because Teddy it's a moronic label. America's real enemy is the #TeaParty and stupidity (that means you Teddy)!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 

It's alive? Did you take a break from your job to open a new Tim Horton's? @SenTedCruz #AudittheFed
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Trump over has never said hoew he plans on doing anything either.  He isnt a Conservative  he's a demopublican
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and you sir want to give credit to a Gang not nation of radicals center stage, as a vet they no threat to U.S. are you?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Not everyone can STAY AFRAID, states this former veteran of the last years of the cold war era.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS it's not ISIS it's ISIL ...ISIS is a Egyptian goddes stop disrespecting that name
@SenTedCruz You're a taint!
.@SenTedCruz You diminish the promise of the US. @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS OMGosh you're still stuck on WORDS. Is that all you've got? It's old, move on and better out! You are as bad as Trump
@SenTedCruz @POTUS he also refused to use the words "Leave the gun.  Take the cannoli."  He clearly diminished the mafia.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS The president said "kill I.S.I.S." George Bush created I.S.I.S. so Radical Islam becomes syntax
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Quite the little Armchair Commander-In-Chief, aren't ya, Ted-O?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS One year left...and it was a speech of internal homefront interest, what I need to hear more of in the future!
@SenTedCruz @frankgaffney @POTUS Why bother with the "radical"?  Isn't terrorism by definition radical? There is no moderate Islamic terror
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Islamic state, Israel Syria
@SenTedCruz #STFU
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump are more of a threat to us than Isis #SOTU
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Here you go Ted, here's a dictionary to help you out:  https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/diminished …
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I don't think anybody in this country can diminish the threat of ISIS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS He is the threat from ISIS through enabling their infiltration of #US
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and you would prefer we live in fear under a dictatorship government. Can't all get what we want, now can we?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS He also didn't advocate carpet bombing a city full of civilians *GASP*
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Christ on a Cross! Are you still so fucking stupid you think that phrase means shit ? Fuck you Cruz
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I agree.   He has diminished the threat of ISIS.   And he certainly diminished the threat of Al Qaeda. Glad you noticed.
@Crutnacker @SenTedCruz @POTUS you'd face more threats on the daily living in the south side of Chicago. ISIS is nothing compared to America
@SenTedCruz @POTUS except when he did. Take a vote Ted and Authorize the war #SOTU #ISIS #DoYourJob
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  @saying "radical Islamic Terriorist":  If we said Radical white terrorist for SC shooter, would we have saved lives?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @saying or how about saying Radical Police Terroist, would Freddie Gray have lived?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS a fight about semantics? Really? When are you going to mention the Washington "Cartel"?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS So radical and terrorism isn't enough, you have to link it to a religion that billions practice peacefully every day?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS did acknowledge it without demonizing an entire religion. He said that they don't speak for ALL Muslims.They're fanatics.
@SenTedCruz go back to Canada
@SenTedCruz HE MENTIONED ISIL. DID YOU EVEN LISTEN.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Well sometimes not saying anything is saying something. Why mention them directly? It may validate them? #SOTU16
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I think that since you didn't show up you didn't hear the speech correctly #gop always attempts to twist words
@SenTedCruz Ted, according to POTUS, the major threat against the Americans is Climate Change not terrorism by Islamic Radicals
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You refuse to say the words "Obamacare is a success," too, Teddy.
@angryandliberal @SenTedCruz @POTUS http://bit.ly/1P0EHuu 
@SenTedCruz @POTUS So what?? Who cares what you call people?  Good grief, man, get a  grip on your life...meanness doesn't work...
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You weren't listening again. ISIL is not Islam.
@kamijane29 @SenTedCruz @POTUS do you know what the letters stand for??
@SenTedCruz JV-designation has never been changed.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS no mention of Navy ships being held hostage!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted Cruz you scare me more then any terrorist
@agree114_vt @SenTedCruz @POTUS why is that?
@pleasehelp55 @SenTedCruz @POTUS he's a grandstanding fear mongering televangelist who sucks up all the for sound bytes
@agree114_vt @SenTedCruz @POTUS ahh now I understand
@SenTedCruz @POTUS ISIS? You mean the JV team that was contained before the Paris massacre?
@SenTedCruz as he should and you should get a grip
@SenTedCruz go fuck yourself
@SenTedCruz @POTUS shut up
@SenTedCruz @POTUS   WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK ISIL IS?
GO BUY A NEWSPAPER AND READ UP
@dontritter @SenTedCruz @POTUS ISIL...?
@pleasehelp55 @SenTedCruz @POTUS 
Google it
@dontritter @SenTedCruz @POTUS its ISIS!
@pleasehelp55 @SenTedCruz @POTUS 
They are not contained in Iraq and Syria
@dontritter @SenTedCruz @POTUS then why is it called Isis?
@pleasehelp55 @SenTedCruz @POTUS 
ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ & SYRIA 
         VS
ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ & LEVANT 
LEVANT IS COMPRISED BIGGER AREA
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Of course, because the power of US citizens is the real evil & ISIS is only a JV team.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and failed to mention our Sailors in Iran. It's daylight there now, where are they?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS besties w the Muslims didn't even speak of war on Christians. Unamerican
@sentedcruz @potus Ted it is snowing in Calgary.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Do you have one single idea on how to fix this mess either?
@draMobile @SenTedCruz @POTUS I was going to say the same thing.
