@SenTedCruz and the world never changes.   Your thinking is obsolete. Keep pushing the clock backwards, opposition will rise
But he sure is no #MerrickGarland.
The Dems can slow walk this guy but he will be confirmed and do a wonderful job for us.
So did Garland, but he did not even get a hearing, disgusting, remember #ourrevolution 2018 coming up.
I thought the rule was "The next President gets to make the SCOTUS" pick?
@SenTedCruz just want to remind you to not use the word "unprecedented" we can see & hear you and we remember.
The Founders didn't even believe in originalism. They interpreted the Constitution during the first Constitutional crisis...
originalism just means he's conservative. Yes and the Framers weren't originalists because they were the originals.
Implied powers and strict construction (originalism) run contrary to each other
@jstines3 They don't care it's tit for tat that's how childish they are, and were paying them 4 that behavior , sick.
@WilkowMajority Thank you for blocking Garland and holding out for the best Supreme Court Judge there is.  Another promise kept
I totally agree. Unfortunately, the racist pigs in Congress refused to be honorable toward the legitimate POTUS.
And we, therefore, must seek recompense on Obama's behalf for the good of the country.
does it get tiring being this wilfully sicophantic? Just asking...
Gorsuch quals fine so were Merrick's. You/Repubs blocked Merrick because of politics, dislike of Obama. Turnabout is fair play
NO, Gorsuch must explain his hostility to women's rights, corp support over workers & opposition to campaign finance reform.
@SenTedCruz Did you two share needles in college, or are you both just brain damaged naturally?
@SenTedCruz he's also evil
@SenTedCruz Get Gorsuch confirmed! No more DC Dog and Pony show!
Fight confirmation at all costs.
Even Neil Gorsuch pointed out Garland was wrongly denied #SCOTUS due to GOP obstruction:  http://nyti.ms/2jSUCxw 
That is true.
agreed !
@SenTedCruz Do you know enough about #Gorsuch to agree to #45years? He was picked by a #RealityTV â›§(can't say #mogul; #notaxes)
HERES SOME TEXTUAL COMPOSITIONS NO MORE ROBBING USA& WORLD WITH CITIZENS UNITED,DEA,OIL WAR MONGERING YO!GOT IT GOP?
The next nominee to be voted on is MERRICK GARLAND. You stole his seat.
@SenTedCruz So was Merrick Garland. Hypocrite.
@WilkowMajority horrors what an extremist! How could we possibly have someone on scotus that FOLLOWS law, not SJWs
@SenTedCruz that's gonna take a fight. So win it. For the D's complaining garland was denied, he was borked yall coined the term
enjoy the wait... last time I checked America had a Supreme Court nominee 12 months ago. #karma
@SenTedCruz so was Garland, U spineless, pieces of  pickles. ðŸ›‡ pretending this is about anything other than partisan bullshit.
@SenTedCruz Two words: Merrick Garland.
so does Merrick Garland,  sir.
Cruz who urged @GOP to hold the Scalia seat open for ADDITIONAL 4 years if HRC won,isn't in the best position to lecture Ds now
@SenTedCruz Repubs threatened to block all Clinton nominees as they did Garland. I hope Dems give Gorsuch the same consideration
You are on the wrong side of history. STAND UP for the American people and stop this tyrant! #resist
geez, your staff tweeted this 3 times. Not careful
@SenTedCruz so is Merrick Garland
Garland is more thoughtful. And, importantly, he knows he lives in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. An advantage
@SenTedCruz Merrick Garland is a prepared, thoughtful, and careful jurist, who has demonstrated a strong commitment to justice
Hope the Judge has the cahones to last through the barrage of B.S. the Dems are going to unload his way.
jump into deep wateer
Where does he stand on Canadians running for POTUS?
He will be a refreshing change to the current climate, and we welcome him!!!
I call him a "Constitutionalist" and his method "Constitutionalism".  These descriptions are more accurate & intuitive.
@McAllisterDen but Andy Schafly says Gorsuch is NOT pro-life as Trump promised
Even if it goes no farther, textualism and originalism has already taken a hit in the USA.
Politics changed it 1913.
is he for killing babies or  protecting life that is the big question? Millions of future children will depend on the.right one
according 2 Andy Schafly on @SteveDeaceShow who went 2 law school with Gorsuch he's NOT pro-life & maybe 4 LGBTQ right
That would be GREAT!  That would mean he cares about the living.
@LindaSuhler Great choice!
I was hoping you were the SCOTUS pick!
you tweeted wonderful facts.  And the good American peeps agree w/ you & support you! XO
Mike you underestimated Pres. Trump. The ppl have spoken, dont ever forget.
So he's in favour of  "A well regulated militia"?
Militia: Near Universal Membership: The laws:
did you just read that off of Wikipedia? How about you work for all of UT and not just yourself!
@TomFitton
@TomFitton Proof?
@KNDetweiler libs will try and destroy him
@SenTedCruz and sexism. Don't forget sexism! #SCOTUS
