@SenTedCruz @POTUS @cologop SHAME ON  YOU IF YOU ACCEPT THOSE DELEGATES!!!
.@SenTedCruz @POTUS Interesting how you want separation here but not when it comes to church and state!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS America doesn't need a Baptist pope in Revival Tent Ted. We need someone to make great deals and bring jobs home!
@sqeptiq @SenTedCruz Yeah Donald will make great deals once he's finished ridiculing POW's and making fun of disabled people. Get a clue!

@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted Cruz is such a monumental idiot, we should all assume the exact opposite of what he says is true.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS yes
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you will be a false POTUS. Live with it..
@SenTedCruz @POTUS the way you are taking the election, is an act of treason against the people of this nation. We will not stand down..
@SenTedCruz @POTUS revolution is the right of the people to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests
@SenTedCruz @Steph_C_OBrien @POTUS Ted Cruz - you have to be the most phony/smarmy weasel I've ever witnessed. When ur own roommate hates u?
@AlekeMsumba @SenTedCruz @POTUS an unhappy roommate is your judge of a weasel?  Where do the "felon" and/or "socialist" rank?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  you really think you can win in new York.  Donald will have a heart attack
@SenTedCruz @POTUS   nice speech
@sentedcruz @potus  Build the Wall
@SenTedCruz if only you knew enough about the Constitution to speak so authoritatively.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS DO something about it!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Bail Out. We want the Frontrunner Donald Trump to be the Nominee.

When will you accept your infidelities caused Heidi to walk on I-35 distraught and got arrested?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Well yes. He doesn't believe in States rights or the Constitution. You know, the one he swore to uphold & defend.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and one day, we as a Nation can shake Goverment corruption - and return Americans to a Constitutional Functioning Govt !
@SenTedCruz @POTUS. A wrongly made promise is wrong to keep. You don't have to support Trump. He's proven inadequate. Say you won't support.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS   It worked for Reagan and Bush.  Worked for your Dad.
@SenTedCruz @AtweetN @POTUS Yes, if only #TedCruz & @SenMikeLee with @RandPaul had moved to impeach the SOB USURPER FRAUD. Traitors.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I'm curious. Your camp wants to ask the voters  about a Supreme Court nominee. Would you be willing to ask about this?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS So, what else is new? Now, explain why Congress won't stop him.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS All funded by your traitorous party, but you knew that!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Novel concept: work across the aisle to produce common sense immigration policy. DOING NOTHING is a losing strategy.
