@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Cruz you refused aid to NJ after Sandy. Now TX needs help. Doesn't feel good does it?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Ted one question-- why don't any senators like or endorse you?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott what happen to Texas seceding ?? Now asking Obama for help?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Federal aid for TX, OK? Northeast or other parts of U.S. Too Bad, Have to cut spending. Only TX.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Look at the pool "Lucifer" you can not win are you the person that close our government

@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott sen Cruz you were born in Canada and live in Racist Texas you must be a racist religious white man
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott #doyourjob
@SenTedCruz Cruz and Kasich are guys who made D's on school report card, and then tried to BRIBE the Teacher to give them an A. Pathetic!!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott sounds like creeping socialism to me as well as extreme hypocrisy
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott 
LoL Lyin' Ted !  No YOU've done NOTHING FOR TEXAS. Nothing.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Rotten Rafael needs to go back to Texas and do his job. Cheat Texas not America.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Cruz.  Do you check your forehead each night to see if your horns are growing?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Go back to Texas, please, Rotten Rafael.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott you voted against #hurricanesandy disaster relief.

@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott There is ZERO reason that all taxpayers, should have to pay the costs. YOU are wrong on this.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott YOUR STATE COUNTS THE EAST COAST DOESN'T. POTUS??  #NEVER #SANDY
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott It is NOT the JOB of tax payers, to pay for natural disasters, have insurance, pay your own crap.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Alabama didn't get one after flooding/tornadoes, repeatedly. People need to pay for it THEMSELVES.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott get out of the race Cruz.  You are a creep!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott I suggest that POTUS  show the same ideals you did for Hurricane Sandy victims and reject you!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUSI knew they would want Fed Gov help even when they're threatening to secede!
@SenTedCruz JohnKasich Strategy with Cruz smacks of foul play. Both Campaigns will suffer accordingly. America hates cheaters.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @GovAbbott - Lame duck @POTUS indeed. As long as HIS goals align with YOURS you are happy to cooperate. #hypocriTed
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott you and kasich would be very bad for the USA in the white house you are lying Ted
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Cruz you and  kasich are chicken and r under handing  the primary you both are typical - politics

@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Or what, you'll shut down govt again, maybe pull out another Dr Seuss book from the office shelf
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Step down. Before Sean Hannity humiliates you again.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Cruz you have no ethics at all. You brag on how you can beat @realDonaldTrump? Teaming up w/.JK?

@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott lots of dynamic noise. Stead fast senator,  history is at your back.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott shame on you Ted Cruz God will be the judge of you
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Perhaps he should give the response you gave to Hurricane Sandy?
" @SenTedCruz You are the single biggest liar. You probably are worse than @JebBush 

Do I need to spill the beans about Heidi again, Teddy?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott  10 days later .. glad your not my Senator now tell Kasich to go clean up that pot-bloodbath
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Fuck Texas! Don't they want to secede from the Union? Don't they want small government?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott no worries- he doesn't care about anyone not in a blue state
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott GO back to Texas & do the job you need to do w the floods. Late just like Bush w the help.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Cruz abandoned Texas inorder to come in second to Trump, some Senator you have there.  #lyinted
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott So you are like trying to be a hero?  You didn't do anything. A little late.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Why are you sucking on the federal government teat?  Just pray the floods away.
@SenTedCruz @ChrisChristie Be careful setting terms-Sandy money went to Low income PPL. Who in Jersey near beach that owns home are poor?
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott You know what's common sense? Keeping Republicans out of common bathrooms #Hastert
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Did you ask Hastert for his advise? Republicans present more of a danger than trans. #Hipocricy
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott How many disasters does it take to screw in a light bulb???
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Why?  Texans need to lift themselves out of  hardship. Maybe the second amendment can help
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott U don't give a tinkers darn about Texas! UR too busy trying to B King.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Wait, you want the feds to intervene? That's not CONSERVATIVE. #LyingTed

@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Cruzzer left the state and the disaster was gone also
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott Senator, yet when New York and New Jersey needed aid after Hurricane Sandy, you voted NO!!!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott I thought you didn’t believe in Federal money helping people & states. Remember Flint Michigan!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott We have a disaster here in TX.Haters on this thread, you should be ashamed of yourself! Unreal.

@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott  attack the "act"... it isn't conservative.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @POTUS @GovAbbott So the three of you do nothing but troll the guy and now expect help??  Great.
