pfft to the loser Cruz; there's a reason you lost the nom-you're basically a political troll
Which has nothing to do with his statement here. Grow up!
It most certainly does. He's trolling the POTUS w/ "no force of law" which was never claimed in the decree. Study up!
He's not trolling. He tweeted the nut directly. O has NO business or right to demand men use women's restrooms.
Well, now, you're showing your ignorance or stupidity about transgenders.
I'm curious, would you allow a grown man, dressed as a woman, go into the restroom with your little girl?
I wouldn't let my little girl go to the restroom without me. U R ? assumes it would be obvious he is a male pt1
It took me a while to find Megyn Kelly's comments: “A lot of sex offenders are men who molest men, little boys..pt2
Transgender = SEVERE mental disorder, no more, no less. Insult away @SudokuG. It speaks volumes.
Such ignorance is pathetic. I feel bad for ppl like you.
Wow. Insults. From someone who 'thinks' being 'transgender' is normal and healthy.... Who'd have 'thunk' it?
Oh, yes, you are one of them as I look at your tweets.
"one of them"?
Yes, either an ignorant person who truly doesn't know any better or a stupid one who doesn't care to learn.
So Dr. Paul R. McHugh is ignorant or stupid right? I mean if YOU accuse it MUST be true right? http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15145/ 
Did you read the articles that I posted? I didn't accuse him just because I wanted to, fool.
This isn't a constitutional issue and Lyin' Ted knows this. Executive branch has every right to control public schools
If your child thinks it's a dog or cat do you take it to the vet or a Pediatric psychiatrist.......

Stop the next #evolution of #bathroompolitics! Sign & #RT the #petition at https://www.change.org/p/mitch-mcconnell-28th-amendment-no-genders-sexes-except-male-and-female … #tcot @SenTedCruz @jan_pierce @POTUS @GOP
It's people like you who don't care that trans people get killed everyday for just being themselves.
You probably don't even thing being transgendered is real.
Is he using this to distract from his push for a federal zoning board, or because he's a lame duck reduced to a bathroom badger?
@DrSueDVM @POTUS 
Problem is, we've ceded undue pwer 2 the exec to take money from the states & then make demands 4 it's return.
Where did you get the idea that transgendered people go and rape and molest women and children? Where?? Please tell!
@LiveFreedomOrDi @POTUS Respectfully, I believe this issue ONLY here 2 muddy & hide REAL issues facing Americans. Smoke/mirrors
this virtue signaling is getting out of hand. Are these the same people get triggered by everything? that issue vanished?
Hey Ted why are you so paranoid about bathrooms now when this has been going on for years? http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Boy-Sexually-Assaulted-in-Dave--Busters-Bathroom-282331091.html …
@papacass84 @POTUS Well , that settles it Cruz said it and he knows constitution Now  convince Congress, Senate, POTUS , SCOTUS
The day of reckoning may have finally come...what do you all think?
Just say NO to idiocy! C'mon people, where's your backbone? Don't you think we passed the point of doing nothing?
what happened to "Only Congress can make Laws" O makes bathroom law, Congress does nothing.
Let's try to KEEP our Republic a Constitutional System of Government. #VoteCruz #WriteinCruz
@deblessings @POTUS So who enforces the law against the Executive Branch?
Congress. What is happening is a rule by fiat where gov agencies under Potus are expanding via directives @ThomasPaine5 @SenTedCruz @POTUS
In this instance I believe States will take this to SCOTUS, IMO @ThomasPaine5 @SenTedCruz @POTUS
SCOTUS does not have the guns to enforce anything.
@kksheld @POTUS Funny that this has been going on in bathrooms for decades, but someone got s fire in their ass recently!
THE #BATHROOM BULLSHIT HAS TO STOP! MR.PRESIDENT HAVE YOU BEEN IN YOUR DAUGHTERS BATHROOM? CHILD  ABUSE?
dont just sit there DO SOMETHING !
most of what barry does has no force of law. He takes out pen/paper and tada,a law is made He has no concern for kids
We need common sense solutions to all bullying and violence in schools. Outreach by parents, aware admins and teachers.
Keep up the good work .
@kksheld @POTUS See that he can not withhold funds from the States Please.
@kksheld @POTUS Just another power grab. Checking whether America has the guts to say, NO!  He's pretty sure we're too scared.
it has zero to do with RR more like creating enough distractions away from Hillary
@DeborahLovesUSA @POTUS I WISH DELEGATES VOTE FOR CRUZ
@FFRF The only known organized group that molests and rape children is the Catholic Church. Real danger.
A  transg guy(born female dressed like a guy) just  walked into a lady bathrm. My dtr was terrified and comes  out screaming
And soon to be former Sen #zodiackiller can piss up a rope into the wind. As usual.
So STOP him for once in 8 freaking years!!!!!!!!
#FireCruz he's a Traitor to the American People...Obama did all he did while Cruz stood there, vote any other Republican
and you'll stand Bye Obama on this one too...just like all his other Non-American policies while you were in the Senate
agree he is in fit to serve
Good. Stupid issue.
Dah.
You're obsessed with this transgender br thing. #housebill2 is a joke, it's not even legally literate, get back to zodiac killin
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
stop denying them the right to be themselves
it seems that you fail to understand that these people are people who identify as their sex.
(Always Constitution )
#CruzForScotus
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
.@SenTedCruz @DrKC4 @POTUS True, but the threat of withholding funds is coercive. And is pointed at the teachers and students! Challenge it!
no one cares about trannies or where they poo, let's #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
It's the 21st century man. Deal with it.
More proof that Ted Cruz is a great leader and POTUS is a bullying ideologue.
Plus hideously expensive.  HS kids now EXPERIMENTING being transgender-- anything for a kick. Why'd POTUS give them idea?
Never trump, Hillary orany man/woman.
https://twitter.com/DearRazz/status/731315787781275648 …
He is the only one who can make America great again
1Sam 8
Cruz would kill his mother for attention
@FranklinMan25 @POTUS It's the implied threat to cut off funds that has force.  Who takes the King's money, is the King's man
The Liberals & far left can & will get the blame no matter how hard they try to spin this. #MyStanceGiven
@robforshey   I KNOW TED. NOW WHY HASN'T ANYONE BROUGHT IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS?.......
It pisses me off how the GOP controlled congress has done nothing to impeach the evil dictator Obama.
I FEEL YA. IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF TOO. MCCONNELL BEARS 95% OF MY HATRED, AS DO HIS ILK....
@Deb4Cruz Ted Cruz is the ONLY REAL LEADER in America #CruzCrew  God has not voted yet...have faith !
@gary_lankford @SenTedCruz @Deb4Cruz keep the faith and do not fear
Amen Beckie !  our God can do anything ! if He wants Cruz in the White House, Ted will be !
hey looking for a third party gain a little knowledge before you run your mouth
@veriphile @POTUS Keep fighting for us.  Reagan lost the first time also.
Much of what this prez has done has no force of law, yet his fiat stands. Congress fails to enforce separation. So what's point?
Welcome to life in totalitarian America, when #GOVT uses 0.3% of population to forcibly take rights of 99.7% - #WomensRights?
: At this point it's all lip service. People don't believe anything coming from Washington DC! TOTAL distrust!!
I thank God I grew up in an era where I wasn't FORCED to use the bathroom with men.  God help us all.
:You tell um Ted! Maybe they'll listen to another politician.
CHECK OUT AND SEE IF HILLARY AND BAM BAM OBAMA HAVE OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS BET THEY DO
GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
JUDGED WE CAN'T HAVE HILLARY WIN OR WE WILL BE A THIRD COUNTRY USE ALL TOOK A PLEDGE SO STAND BEHIND IT PLEASE THANK YOU

BATHROOM THAT THEY WANT THEN THEY SHOULD PAY FOR TO HAVE ONE MADE FOR THEM AND THEY CAN PAY FOR IT NOT US TAX PEOPLE AS
this whole circus was created out of thin air by GOP,don't be outraged when it's called bullshit. #youknownothing
WELL MR CRUZ IF YOU DON'T STAND BEHIND TRUMP WE WILL HAVE FOUR YEARS OF HILLARY IF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WANT TO USE ANY
@FRCdc #ObamaAndGomorrah
You are 100% correct!  Hopefully you would be open to a supreme court appointment should Trump win and he offers it.
cruz for hall monitor
Stop your fear mongering and lying Ted. U r nothing but a grandstanding bigot. Please dropout as my rep in the Senate.
Thank you for standing up for what is reasonable. You make perfect sense and you have my vote if you re'enter the race.
A public school teacher here; those trany's will use the girls bathroom over my dead body.
#thanks for sharing about government, have a great Saturday :)
the problem is we don't have a Congress that has the courage to stand up to him.
another example of executive branch overreach.  This is crazy!
@LOVEINE @POTUS 
OBAMA WILL REMAIN A MENACE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
Obummer is pulling out all stops as his lame duck Presidency comes to an end.
Obama said he would defund education if schools do not comply.  I hope Americans call his bluff.
Those poor schools will be forced to the bathroom mandate or whatever the king wants. Other schools can call his bluff.
Agree 100%. I really do not think the prez can be serious about defunding schools.  I like the juggernaut reference.
no constitución

#apathy #ignorance #bathrooms
@POTUS #WarOnAmerica #radical #libtard

Support @SenTedCruz #CruzCrew
@libertybell1776 @POTUS Obama has no right to dictate restroom issue!! Every state needs 2 revolt against DOJ Title 9 disgrace
he didn't decree that men and boys should be able to use women's facilities, he said women should be able to. Get it right.
@ByrdsFinger @POTUS  While the delegate thief aspires to be hall monitor-in-chief, @realDonaldTrump becomes commander-in-chief
That awful moment when parents finally discover what US #Govt has become- #Obama forcing #PublicSchools- Govt far too Big
is all this a distraction by the @POTUS? The day before this, a federal judge ruled some of his actions unconstitutional
Here's an idea for a new bill. For every $ that BHO takes away from states,deduct 2x that amount from the Dep of Educ.
settle down lyin ted
@JoshPainter2154 @sarahpalinusa One national Republican leader thinks this is important. Others in Trump's transgender bathroom?
So, ignore it.
you're a father, how would u feel if ur kids couldn't be who they really were & went to the bathroom fearing abuse?
Lying Ted!!!
So glad u value the constitution over the preference of young students. Good job continuing a culture of discrimination
It's time to get rid of Obama! DO YOUR JOBS!
@cangab # thank you for upholding the values of Texas! We need you #you are doing a wonderful job.
Please continue to stand against Dictator Obama!
This bathroom law must be stopped in every state.
@BarackObama legacy will gloriously include first federal bathroom mandate. @MichaelBerrySho @realDonaldTrump @KevinNR
don't worry #Lyin'Ted we'll be there for ur re-election to senate too! 
This has no importance on the future of our country. Find real problems to care about.
.@SenTedCruz @pjfahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump TedCruz should be on the SCOTUS!!!
southern women do NOT want MEN in our bathrooms. SC has highest rate of women killed by MEN/ don't give them another way
Glad 2 see u are focusing on REAL issues facing America versus nonsense like income inequality or global warming. Dope.
Law. Constitution. Those things never stopped him before.
The answer to a liberal education is Home Schooling!  Make certain your children get a good education Home School!
MR.PRESIDENT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU MADE THE AMERICAN MOM MAD AS HELL!
Bathrm mandate may/may not b constitutional but unlike U it reflects compassion and respect 4 the dignify of human beings
The Republican establishment doesn't support Trump. New question: do voters support the Republican establishment?
LAST NIGHT ON CHANNEL 13 A DAD WAS ON T.V. HIS SON WAS A CONTRACTOR AT A PLANT HIS SON WAS BEHEADED THEY CAN'T NOT FIND THE HEAD
I totally agree. Restroom's are not seats on a bus, or access to a university. Public restrooms are already suspicious.
what would you know about it, hold hearings on scotus
Then tell the Muslim go screw himself!
Agreed Sen. Cruz! Stand against this travesty.
- so fix it Sen Cruz.
That's right!
no but he will use bribes to strong arm the unwilling.
Real surprised Lucifer @SenTedCruz is backing his demon-in-chief.
just leave it alone men use men's room ladies use ladies room the rest go where ever you want.
Thank you, Ted Cruz! #sanity
ball you libratards fighting over this where have these tranys been going until now? That right where ever they want to.
.@SenTedCruz @CarlyCanDo @POTUS ...it seems like no one is safe anywhere from the barrage of demands from the LGBT as #HollywoodPromotes
Please run again next time, sir.  You love our country.  You believe in our Constitution. You are a good man.
@MATTIPOYSTI @POTUS ..and it's outrageous! Is barry willing to let his girls shower with boys?? PC insanity on display!
but the civil rights act does
then please go back to the senate and change it!!!!
look in your pants then u will know which bathroom to use
You have an unhealthy interest in children and bathrooms. You also missed out part of your CV when you were Dirty Harry
January 2017 can't come fast enough!!
He is advocating for a mental disorder to be normalized. Children should not be encouraged to be 'trans' anything.
Donald wasted you. You should apologize to him for being such a jerk. Give the nominee respect! #Trumptrain
But, unlike our coward Congress, Big O IS willing to stop $ to schools which don't comply. $ is more powerful than law.
@realDonaldTrump   Thank you Senator Cruz.
good!
but force of lawsuits and withdrawal of federal funds that GOP congress will do nothing to stand in the way of will.
I think schools should have trans-gender bathrooms
and you all have allowed this crap to go on for how long. No elected official has really stood up to potus.
listen to Cruz on this one , we are pissed and it's not going to get better , only worse. God bless this country
yes the sky fairy should make the rules! #sarcasm
...amen
My concern is RESTROOM- BATHROOM- TOILET. I didnt say anything about LOCKERS and SHOWERS- The issue is becoming COMPLEX
Thank you for clarifying this. I thought was a mandate and schools had no choice. Its Crazy how president makes threats.
@heidiponyrider @POTUS "no force of law", this why tyrannical administration resorts to blackmail. Good reason for defunding DOE
Nor any authority and will be ignored by most.
#cruzmistressscandal #cruzlost #cruzcubancrisis Teddy, face it you are a has been political hack. Get a real job resign
I agree. He's lost his fucking mind.
God
But we are no longer under a constitutional system of government. It's been ailing for years. BO has finished it off.
Thank you @SenTedCruz. Please keep fighting for us. #CruzCrew
When are you picking your cabinet Ted???
2/2 the process. I will be writing your name on the ballot and voting for a true Constitutionalist. NEVER D.Trump!
Ted is confuse
d 
He thinks Obama trying to force people to go to bathroom.?
...now you are finally on the right page
except the part where everyone is created equal
Our Constitutional System has been totally ignored by all three branches of government. D Trump will complete 1/2
If the democratic party supports this going forward, they will lose the soccer mom's vote in november
you still lost tho
shocker that Potus has not a fucking clue on the constitution or what his latitude is within the confines.  Worst #Potus
All rules & regs not written & approved by Congress are null & void
Attempts to enforce are an act of war
#EPA #BLM @SenTedCruz
Trump has openly supported allowing Men into Little Girls Restrooms.  Evangelicals who supported Trump voted for a pervert.
frankly this why you need to stay in office multifronts
by the way I am taking about Mr Cruz I can not wait for the current POTUS to leave.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
Get Congress to do something!
agreed. So they should not get any federal funding. It's a state and local issue
Don't you recall the reason you just ran for prez @SenTedCruz? @POTUS doesn't care about the constitution. #TimeforaRevolution
I will actively work agaisnt your re-election efforts. You mislead well-intentioned Christians for fame/profit/influence
Do as I say or I'll take your money away, great leadership.
Obama is putting the boots to America on his way out! He needs to be deported or jailed.  Whichever is faster!
impeach this impostor
The Obama administration’s tough stance against North Carolina’s law coupled with this latest effort to expand the rights
of transgender students, is sure to renew the anger of conservatives who have fought tooth and nail to prevent progress
on a host of social issues, from marriage equality to whether gays can serve openly in the military.
FYI this why you lost the primary race.
“No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,”
We must ensure that our young people know that whoever they are or wherever they come from
they have the opportunity to get a great education in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and violence.
YOUR NO BETTER THAN @realDonaldTrump AND @SpeakerRyan
