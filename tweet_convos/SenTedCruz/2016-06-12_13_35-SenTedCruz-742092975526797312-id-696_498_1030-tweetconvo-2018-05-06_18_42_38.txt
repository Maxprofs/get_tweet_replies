Today, all of America stands in solidarity with the people of Orlando. http://1.usa.gov/1WKzZnr 
.@SenTedCruz Prayers to the same god who commands you to kill gays and inspires you to take their rights away? Nice.
BUT Cruz´s Heart & Prayers are with bla bla bla
your heart has never gone out to us. You've perpetuated this behavior. What does your book say about hypocrisy?
: Ask for God's forgiveness. Evil is your heart.
God doesn't exist. It's a human creation.
: You better hope that. I believe he's real. Jesus Christ is My Lord & Savior. He can be yours for the asking. @hollysdollar
you can have him. Some of us prefer a personal relationship with reality. @victor_urbieta @hollysdollar
: You'll regret it. Just know He is there for you always and forever. He loves you. @victor_urbieta @hollysdollar
- WHY do you say there will be regret?  By whom?
@BobbiJ0609 @victor_urbieta @hollysdollar
: I'm getting ready for work. Stay tuned. You have a chance, too. We all do. God bless. @BobbiJ0609 @victor_urbieta @hollysdollar
#ThoughtsAndPrayers liar....
Hearts go out to the victims, hands go out to the @NRA death dealers. Shameless hypocrite. 

#VoteThemOut
The same victims you'd spit upon because they're gay and seek equal rights and protections under law. @SenTedCruz
It was a terrorist attack, kid. That means U attack back. With bombs. With drones. With the whole kit & caboodle. @SenTedCruz
The attacker was from St. Lucie County, Florida, right? At what point should hostilities begin?
When he aligned with the enemy, he ceased to be American. How is this confusing? @lawhawk @SenTedCruz
Wow. You think you can unilaterally change the Constitution regarding citizenship.
J, This is not the joke U & Tom make it out to be. #Childish.
U r rigid & lack critical thinking skills & basic Constitutional knowledge. Get off my TL
U joined my conversation dear, not the other way around. Stick UR head back in the sand. @Thomas_Howden @lawhawk @SenTedCruz

do something more than pray.  You have the ability to make military grade weapons illegal in this country.  Do so.
Say it with me: LGBT. You can do it. LGBT. Just go: LGBT. Hey, we'll even take "The gays" if it's so hard for you. #DisarmHate
SHOW your solidarity DO something resembling ANYTHING to end gun violence in the US #holdthefloor @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal
Don't say your heart goes out to the victims when you fight tooth and nail to take away their rights because of who they love.
#Republicanhypocrisy 
"Our hearts go out to gun victims, 
but NRA money goes into our wallets." 
Repeat.
hey instead of sending prayers, help other families not lose a loved one by using your power against gun laws
When was the last time you supported or voted to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals?
here's you with Pastor Kevin Swanson who advocates killing gays you fucking hypocrite
Instead of prayers @SenTedCruz why don't you legislate a ban on assault weapons Offer something real instead of your useless prayers
Acknowledge #attackonLGBTcommunity and keep your thoughts and prayers
enough of your prayers and thoughts. Make your actions match. #filibuster #holdthefloor
What a beautiful, sane, well-thought-out, insightful statement you've shared with us. Thank you Senator!
Is this sarcasm?
spews hate & bigotry against gays & now he wants us to believe he has a heart! You may dress like a christian but it ends there.
vote for gun control. Get the AR-15 off the street. This gun does not make us safer. Quite the opposite.
it's not guns that r @ issue.  As soon as you start profiling & infringe on others rights, then I'll consider infringement of mine
@SenTedCruz
Hearts are great, but what are you going to do about it? You haven't made a plan that we have heard to support.
Do not allow citizens to own assault riffles. There is no need for them. We shouldnt allow people on a watch list to own them.
they were gay. All of them. Killed for being gay. Your rhetoric helped this happen.
a more hypocritical statement I've never heard.
Hypocrite. You spent your entire campaign denigrating the LGBTQ community. Keep your prayers.
You were awfully silent at your presidential speaking event where Homosexuals were called to be put to death. Fucking hypocrite
Aren't you the one that wanted to kill all the gay people? You should be happy! @TPPatriots & @GOP = hate and bigotry!
The first found out who you were via YouTube video of you cooking bacon with a rifle's muzzle. How do you sleep at night?
because prayer works so well. didn't you pray after the previous mass shooting, and the one before ... ? #gunprayer
did you mean to saythose LGBT people killed & wounded whom I've been villifiying all my career
You don't HAVE a heart to go out to the shooting victims and their families.
liar
Shut it, Ted.
keep your dirty prayers. We all know you hate gay people & your voting record against us, proves it
You don't get to campaign on demonizing the LGBTQIA community and then pretend to care for them now. Fuck you, Ted Cruz.
you sir are morally bankrupt
Did you and Pastor Kevin Swanson pray for the victims together?
Cruz, the hypocracy and hatred you spew daily from your religion; makes 'a prayer for grieving loved ones' ring hollow indeed.
Are we really supposed to believe this? You happily associated with a man that advocated for the murder of LGBT people.
your prayers mean nothing if you do nothing about assault weapons
it's because of people like you that things like this happen.
NOPE! Action Sir! We've had enough of your pie-hole noise.
thanks for expressing sympathy for the dead in Orlando. Hey, remember going to this thing? https://m.mic.com/articles/128285/republican-candidates-attend-rally-where-pastor-advocates-death-penalty-for-gay-people#.g15fab3aM …
You have not got an ounce of sincerity in your entire body
The blood of the #Orlando dead is on YOUR hands. You didn't strike the match, but you helped pour the gasoline. J'ACCUSE!
Didn't you speak at a convention where a preacher called for gays to be killed?
Your opposition to background checks, assault weapon ban led to these deaths. #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
Your heart goes out? Really?! I guess you forgot when you gave a speech at Pastor Swanson's 2015 radical "Kill The Gays" rally.
If you would stop promoting anti-LGBT rhetoric, there would be less violence against LGBT people. #PulseShootings #WeAreOrlando
I have a hard time believing the shooter w:inspired by Cruz-or that any1 else, ever, anywhere w/ inspired by him
HATE and BIGOTRY and DEMONIZATION inspire unstable people. Words matter. Saying that LGBT ppl are immoral is WRONG.
well yeah. I just don't think anyone takes Cruz that seriously
.@SenTedCruz If we executed gay people, as Pastor Kevin Swanson advocates, would you still offer your "thoughts and prayers" for us?
...erm
your hate and refusal to accept others mixed w/ ur support of the NRA's radical agenda is what allowed this. This is on ur hands
you've spent your political career voting to ensure lgbt Americans are beneath you. Your thoughts and prayers are meaningless.
Here is @SenTedCruz sharing the stage with a pastor who suggested that gays "are worthy of death"
I don't think it's only Cruz I think is the hole GOP that thinks like that.
You block gun control legislation & degrade LGBT community, but NOW you're sympathetic? Cheap politicizing, even for you, Ted.
Your levels of hypocrisy in the name of faith break my (and, I suspect, Jesus’s) heart. You don’t represent him or me. Resign.
YOU ARE SHAMEFUL! No one wants to hear your thoughts? Prayers? Really? NO WONDER VERY FEW PEOPLE U WORK WITH LIKE U. Yuk
You could care less. This massacre is on the homophobic  GOP. You're trying to deflect our rage to Islam.
this rings hollow to me.
.@SenTedCruz After praying, pls get to work on better bkgrd checks & regs on assault rifles. Mass murder is their only purpose. -a TX voter
: Notice he didn't say a word about radical Islam. Maybe he hopes to be VP with Hillary. Anything to get close to being Pres.
As someone does the bidding of @NRA, you're an accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Actions speak louder than prayers.
you once said the gays were waging jihad on Christians. Was this homophobe your ally or enemy in the fight? #ReligiousExtremism
Was this before or after you thanked the pastor for his "all gays must die, it says so in the Bible" rhetoric? #hypocrite
PRAY HARDER
Zip it hypocrite.  Vote for closing the loophole that allowed this shit to purchase an AR-15
You don't give a damn about the rights of those murdered. God is watching, shame on you.
You embraced Pastor Kevin Swanson, who openly call for death for LGBTs. STFU and Choke on your hate.
then stand up the the gun lobby and homophobia because #VictimsRightsMatterMore than #thoughtsandprayers
Your anti-gay rhetoric shows that you have more in common with ISIS than America. Wake up, you're part of the problem.
unless you work against #hate & lack of #gunsense keep your prayers to yourself because that's only one helped Matthew 6:5
Your prayers mean NOTHING, homophobic hypocrite. You're a hater. If there is a God, I hope he punishes you for your fake prayers
Yet, u happily attended forum & were introduced by Kevin Swanson who called 4 death of gays. btw victims were @ gay bar #Orlando
Bullshit.
Wait - I thought you agreed with the pastor who wants to kill the gays. Hypocrite.
you don't give a damn about us until we're shot at. Somehow that makes it hard to believe this is anything sincere
SPARE US!!! you were at a meeting where the pastor was one who wanted gays to be put to death! YOU BIG HYPOCRITE ! WE SEE YOU!
I'm sure your empathy is welcome but we need action, not prayers after more people are needlessly murdered
you should be ashamed. Better shut up!
How do you sleep at night?
Stop praying and legislate, this is an issue God is not going to solve.
the same group of people you have spent your entire political life persecuting? Conservatives are a joke. #Orlando
since when have you cared, exactly?
I don't want your prayers. I want you to stop trying to degrade my very existence.
<= HYPOCRITE! U were introduced by Kevin Swanson who has called for gays to be murdered & u said NOTHING
weren't you not at the event hosted by Kevin Swanson where he called for the death of gays? Hypocrite.
weren't you right next to a pastor 6 months ago who said all gays should die? You disgust me!
I Hold you personally responsible for failing to keep the offending weapon out of this criminals hands. Your prayers = ZERO
You attended a rally hosted by a pastor advocating gay people be put to death. https://www.yahoo.com/news/republican-candidates-attend-rally-where-014821801.html?ref=gs …
Please join Janet and me in praying for the victims of the Orlando attack and their families.
didn't you stand with a preacher who called for the killing of gays? #hypocrite
You spent your presidential campaign degrading LGBTs
stop with your show. Anyone that can utilize Google knows how fake it is. #Orlando #OrlandoShooting
you literally voted in favor of letting him buy his human slaughtering gun. #Orlando #OrlandoShooting
saw u sharing a stage with a preacher saying all gays shud be put to death. Thought ud be praising the shooter? #Orlando
but u NEVER stood up to specific calls for "christian"wanting gays dead. HYPOCRITE.http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/christian_pastor_says_gays_worthy_of_death_at_conference_with_3_gop_presidential_candidates …
your "thoughts & prayers are fake." People like you are why that massacre was even possible.
OH, ye hypocrite!
how can you pray for a group you constantly try to oppress and treat unfairly??
@LiveFreedomOrDi ok going to challenge this if u mean it get rid of the bigot trump 
He tried. Unfortunately, America is too stupid to know what's good for them. They said no to Ted Cruz.
yep they have created their monster but I will never acknowledge the GOP as a viable party with DT in the lead
God isn't fixing this problem, or elected leaders should be. Why do you refuse to take action, offering only empty words?
But your votes go to the @NRA.
After you get up from praying, start making laws to end gun violence. It's not simply in God's hands.
Except that u & your fellow #Republicans have done everything in your power to destroy queer people’s families. #DontCryForUsNow
You are one of the ringleaders of homophobia in this country. Don't pretend you're not responsible.
In other news, pig shit smells bad.
This is mass murder !!!
meaningless your supporters were probably jumping for joy when news broke. #POS
bullshit. You spent your entire fucking campaign degrading these people. You can't go looking like the good guy now.
YOUR prayers are a joke
aren't you & your friend Kevin Swanson happy? You didn't mind his calling for the death of gays when you campaigned with him.
.@SenTedCruz you have got to understand that your misguided views of LGBT and position on #gunscontrol is partly responsible for #Orlando
Culpability of authoritarian patriarchal politicians&religionists for both the homophobia& the guns is clear
Blood is on your hands.
Your brand of hatred is culminates in this. It is this. You are responsible for these attacks, these deaths.
You actively work towards making this world unsafe for gay people, trans people, people of color.
No, they're not.
your hypocrisy is shameful, you have shared a stage with a pastor who want all gays put to death.
But Ted, you recently shared a stage with Kevin Swanson, who advocates death for homosexuals. You're being insincere
Prayers eh, that worked out well for your POTUS campaign huh.
So many hateful replies to a simple gesture of kindess. sorry @SenTedCruz
hipocrite
Delete your account.
has already received 2016 donations from the @NRA Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ($36,229)
your prayers don't do shit for the dead and their families. Overthrow your NRA masters + make an actual difference. #guncontrol
Yet another two faced republican ass wipe expressing his bullshit sympathy while loving guns and hating the LGBTQ community
God,  I don't believe in you,  but ignore prayers from Ted about the LGBT community.
You hate LGBT people??!!
get fucked
this is an empty sentiment. You've made it clear that you are anti-LGBT, and have helped create this environment of hate.
Keep your prayers. The rest of the time you use them as weapons against LGBT people.
Wait... you don't want to kill all the gays anymore? AP should jump on this.
Delete your account, too.
With all of the hatred and venom you've spewed about the LGBT community and now you want them to believe you have a heart?
You stand on a stage and insult us. Now your "heart" goes out to us? You miserable craven hypocrite. Our #pride will prevail.
Fuck your thought and prayers! You people caused this! Their blood is on your hands.
from the guy who vilified their lives.
Did you write this with your tongue?
How much blood money have you accepted from the NRA?
your prayers aren't going to do shit!!!
you are a scourge on society. In the words of the Internet and also a famous  WOMAN #deleteyouraccount
<Hypocrite>
You & your father spew the most hate against the LGBT+ community. You contributed to this. You do not get to pretend to care.
Keep your prayers. You & rest of GOP are hypocrites - claiming to hold life precious but not funding Zika defense or bucking NRA
is a Scalawag
You are disengenous, immoral, apathetic and hate monger. Keep your phony prayers to yourself. You and GOP has no moral authority
remember when you eagerly shared stage with that nut job Iowa preacher who called for death to gay people? Your prayers indeed.
today none of America has time for your hate the sin/love the sinner after they're dead garbage.
#hypocrite 1st place today!
You wanted us dead. You told the world as much attending Kevin Swanson's gathering. #NEVERForget http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/campaign-stops/ted-cruz-and-the-anti-gay-pastor.html?_r=0 …
Thanks for spending TWO SENTENCES on the victims in your Obama hit piece and you are the #Christian #OrlandoShooting #Disgusting
Bathroom law?
@ndb4ever Then tell your #nevertrump nation to get behind the republican nominee, otherwise your words are useless.
Was for Trump/ @SenTedCruz  super ticket once. Trump flip flops/erratic behavior too much. #NeverHillaryOrTrump for me.
