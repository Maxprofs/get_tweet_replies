All 4 Show. Listen @ 1:20 mark for Heidi's boss' plan & see the Cruz-Bush NWO scam. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UvURb98aqU …
@YouTube You mean the same Cruz that fought Bush and the World Court #MedellinVTexas...Trump trolls
and the same Cruz who hastened a 92 yr old Champion's death. http://www.gopbriefingroom.com/index.php?topic=202778.0 …
dead link...
still had link open-screenshot
hearsay from a fringe right website which had nothing to do with Cruz himself IF even true... LOL
you don't read much do you?
@thedailybeast well that was a waste of time. Accusation without verification...typical Trump stuff
@LibertyIsFTW @tedcruz Ted, we need u to do more than say it & say u tried! Try to get something done! #PJNET
I am shocked that this terrorist in chief has never been arrested & tried.
if that is true why has the media trash been allowed to make it out? Clinton is into censorship wake up
I'm 4 Trump hes the only hope American conservatives have/ Remember Teddy quit and flew with HRC + BHO
Did you read @tedcruz's PIFA bill yet https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3034/text …?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz not exactly censorship
What will you do if  #ImperialTrumptatorship is elected, only allow racist comments?
maybe you can stop him by becoming a deplorable
Dems who crossed over 2 vote 4 trump have no idea how badly they screwed themselves out of this president.
If you read the PIFA bill, you will know how bad. https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3034/text … SPOILER - it is a negative number.
Teddy go after Betrayers of their word and the Republican party. Let us and God know that wroks out.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz what can we do?
Yeah while he boycotts Trump to help Hillary win? What about his pledge? Changed his mind? Really? Phony and sore loser!
thanks for fighting to save the internet and everyone else tell everyone you know what Obama wants to do
Please back TRUMP or you will be in part to blame for the mess to come in the USA - please!
Why can't this political lightweight just keep quiet, at least til the political fiasco he helped create is over?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz I dont agree w/ ICANN control,but I'm sure Cruz's main motive is MONEY! After all, he opposed net neutrality!
I AGREE WITH SENATOR CRUZ
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz 

Who is Ted Cruz?
YES FOLKS, CALL YOUR SENATORS & REPS, TELL THEM TO PUT A STOP TO OBAMA'S GIVEAWAY OF THE INTERNET
You really need to read @SenTedCruz's PIFA Bill and contact your Representatives again. https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3034/text …
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz So are there enough Republicans to stop this or are they rolling over again?
The voters are making a huge mistakeWithout a doubt @tedcruz should be our Nominee. He always puts the people first. Always
which voters are those, exactly? Those who will vote conservative instead of voting Hillary? Surely not!
Exactly, that is what happens. The Internet looses its main protector of free speech and begins to fund the UN regime.
. look at who controls. national.parks and president who gave it away
@SenTedCruz it would be better if we could hear what was said
I believe the Republican's could've beaten Clinton with him as the candidate. But instead we have Donald Trump.
this another speech that is the 76 GOP convention all over again.
Obama has even stated he wants to specifically target social media sites & political bloggers! Yep. H

If Cruz can get Hillary indicted, he will gain all credibility lost.
Cruz can blast all he wants but can he make changes that aren't self-motivated such as supporting #nevertrump?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz don't let him. I blame congress for allowing to do it. Your job to stop him
Go away.
Read the bill and be informed! https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3034/text …. @tedcruz is trying to cuck you.
another example of Ted Cruz being a hero
@RBeus TED Cruz actually does his job!
@bakerlarry84 @scrowder @RBeus #COSProject There's another viable option for America, Choose Independent Evan McMullin,
Ted you have disappointed so many. This we agree on. If Republicans lose election..its self inflicted. #supportthenominee
the lone voice, amongst the trumptards screaming and finger painting with their excrement,  shedding light on the issue..
.@scrowder @JimWilemon @tedcruz Obama intends to continue his globalization policies with a position with UN, needs to globalize everything
@PolitiHate @tedcruz man that dude is amazing!  We messed up bad!
@bakerlarry84 @scrowder @PolitiHate @tedcruz Yes we did,Good news, Another option for America,Choose Independent Evan McMullin
damn the torpedoes
Ted retweeted this lmao
I follow Cruz on Twitter, I mean say what you will, but the guy is INVOLVED and on his feet-Trump ppl shouldn't smear him
I seriously dislike having to agree with Ted, but he's right.
left media don't think it will ever affect them so they don't care @tedcruz
Typical, the Dems. Want to kill free speech in any way possible.
ted your a fighter.sone negatives as a Trump supporter.but also see you now as one of the only fighters besides trump
Again Ted why wouldn't you want to support Trump? Do you prefer Hillary over Trump, & more of this Democratic censorship!
For good reason he blasts it: It's a step toward curtailing free speech for all those who do not ascribe to PC (NEWSPEAK)
What about this story Teddy?
thank you for standing up for our rights, I greatly respect your examples
Well if you don't back Trump so he can sign to save it it will be gone. Just saying
trump won't get the chance. the net will be sourced out at the end of the month.
what a load of trump.
Said the rabidly anti net neutrality corporate theocrat
is the one who wants to stop porn. When in college he wanted to star in porn. #ironic
Now and then
Someone's Photoshopping skills suck in a big way.
@larryk101969 @scrowder @tedcruz
this guy is still around?
thanks for posting this incredible defense of our liberty! Cruz is a steadfast defender of our sovereignty! Ty Ted!!
Cruz is a fascist anti women - gay - black person.
Who?
Cruz has been an icon for this issue, bless the man. w/o him, many would have let this one go.
