@SenTedCruz @startelegram Hahaha!  He's the #Trump whipping boy now. @seanhannity @FoxNews
You realize he's not making calls for Trump.
He has sold his soul to the devil.  We'll never have a #GOP again
Cruz hasn't sold his soul; he didn't endorse he's voting against Clinton
Sold this ...

@SenTedCruz  ways. Shame on all of you.
@SenTedCruz  The party of fiscal responsibility doesn't want to pay taxes, but doesn't mind wasting ours in the most egregious
I believe Ted will do an excellent job !
YOU should be The Nominee, @tedcruz!!
Remember the lack of leadership in Congress is the reason Donald Trump is the Nominee
Millions of Democrats crossed over during the primary and said Democrats are now voting for Hillary.
@SenTedCruz @startelegram all of Congress should be standing on the executive overreach.
@SenTedCruz  Teddy, When are you going to replace the 28 million dollars you cost all of us when you shut the gov down?
@tedcruz fails miserably.  @POTUS is too smart.  @startelegram

@tedcruz @startelegram
@tedcruz @startelegram   you are really uninspired.   Let a smart person replace you
@tedcruz @startelegram oh Ted you fight to get to sleep
Checks and balances exist to enforce the constitution.Precedence allows for legal interpretation of constitution
@SenTedCruz if you didnt talk like a televangelist you would be president
@SenTedCruz You're worried about executive "over reach"...and then you support Trump...you've become a complete joke!
He didn't endorse Trump but said he'd vote for him to stop Clinton; I don't agree but it's reasonable.
I think it's better to stick to your convictions and not vote...as is Glenn Beck.
Beck like me is voting @EvanMcMullin but I respect the decision of @SenTedCruz & haven't lost confidence in him.
