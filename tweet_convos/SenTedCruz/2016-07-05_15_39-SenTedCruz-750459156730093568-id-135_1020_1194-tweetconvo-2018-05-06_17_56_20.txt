@ahomeforlayla Like John Roberts. UGH!
His life was probably threatened just like Roberts
Ask GOP for protection? Laid out while she should have been indicted & then bailed.UGH! @PaulaEbbenWBZ
It wasn't his decision Obama and Lynch already made it then rubbed it in our faces
Can't congress do anything about these people who think they are above the law??
they charged him for allot less than what Hillary did
The Q is why. He's a former prosecutor, he knows better. @FBI
maybe he was blackmailed or received a death threat or told he would be fired
yep #TheFixIsIn need to why, how crooked @HillaryClinton #Comey didn't say no crime, said no prosecution #MAGA
Ethics in Government act (EGA) gives Congress t/ ability to appoint a special prosecutor. Y don't they?
@jasoninthehouse is questioning #Comey lets ask re #SpecialProsecutor  #AmericaFirst
@WitchyWoman722 Congress needs to get some balls for once.
@SurvivorMed I am sure that the @FBI follows the law whenever it can.
lol, in this case it seems to be making shit up
@lsferguson Shades of Justice Roberts and Obamacare.
@HeyTrudi @SenTedCruz @lsferguson Still believe they have something
on Roberts,he was part of GOP & votes socialist agenda?
Yeah that Republican must love Hillary so much...
@gmiller1952 Nah, @JamesComeyFBI was just being Politically CORRECT, I wouldn’t call the @FBI Now & trust them w/ANYTHING!
@SweetFreedom29 Clinton knew she was in the clear. Lynch, Bill, Obama, Comey were all in on it. Justice is dead, this is sad.
Roberts rewrote Obamacare.Reid rewrote a House bill into Obamacare. This is the result of being unchallenged 4so long
@frankhe1 I used to, and I stress used to, have a lot of respect the FBI. They are just another arm of the Clinton thugs.
I saw this in Ferguson before&they held a March..Only difference,the officer was innocent&not running4POTUS!NO JUSTICE NO PEACE
Where is GOP outrage?
< WHAT ARE U GOING TO DO ABOUT IT???????@JoAnnEileen
@Tab1791 Like Obama, Comey does not have that authority so this ballgame is far from over. Hillary must be indicted for lies
Comey has set a dangerous precedent that MUST BE STOPPED!  @HillaryClinton deserves to be charged!
@CruzNewsLive Perfectly in keeping with SCOTUS re-writing what's is written in actual legislation.
so bring him before the senate and question him
@WitchyWoman722 Also Congress should announce that the citizenship clause has not been changed and was illegally altered
@WitchyWoman722 Congress should make clear that the law has not changed.
when the highest investigative officer in America cant justify the rationale 4 taking the high road, what's that say about us?
@ChgocadChic Then he shouldn't be allowed to be Director! Most CORRUPT Administration EVER.
#FreeTheDelegates is ONLY way to win
Romanian hacker Guccifer found dead in Virginia jail cell. 
http://linkis.com/christiantimesnewspaper.com/Po8fa …
that smacks of CIA.
He is working on his resume for SCOTUS...
Why the fuss?
@HillaryClinton is NOT A LIAR!
She's consistently said,
"I will not be indicted"
so tue!
Great, See. Cruz.  Let's stop this corruption.
@48yardline What are you going to do about it?
@julsusa Ted, I am so sorry America didn't see your articulate genuineness. You would have been a great POTUS
Meanwhile the GOPe leadership says nothing, rolls over again. Pathetic. How are we suppose to take you Rs serious? Spineless.
@consmover What are you going to do about it?  About Loretta Lynch?
@noprezzie2012 Just like #JusticeRoberts rewrote ObamaCare.
@MarieMa49685063 I can't believe I agree with Lying Ted!
Just as bad as you flaunting our immigration laws when you snuck in from Canada TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz
@njc0217 a clear violation of the Separation of Powers....
@Hardline_Stance
D rule of law in our country is falling apart & all u can say is, Comey has rewritten a clearly worded federal criminal statute
Your "political speak" is why Trump defeated you. You're not able to speak like "the guy next door" and tell "it like it is"
we are headed for an Article 5 Convention of states. I will be part of this solution. Who will join me? http://www.conventionofstates.com/?utm_campaign=ca_vol_telcon02&utm_medium=email&utm_source=conventionofstates …
@tedcruz which criminal statute has Comey re written?
With all do respect, senator, "political speak" does not solve anything. We are losing our country & this is all you can say?
@JackBlaine3 Why aren't you in Washington moving to remove FBI Director? At least censure him!
@debpearsonTX @SenTedCruz @JackBlaine3 recess
yep
@JackBlaine3 That will come back to hunt him soon, no worries. Is the boomerang effect dear @HillaryClinton basic leadership
Ted, you're out of the race, you lost to Trump (snicker). Stop with the sour grapes
This from the man who tried to keep a guy in prison for nine years longer than the law required. GFY. http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/11/lazarus.dretke/ …
@MaryEMurphy4 I love this guy!
Why are your donors donating heavily to Hillary, "Mr Consitution"? Care to denounce it ? Oh wait :It's that pesky superpac again

*2016 nightmare on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
@Babbsgirl2 Not to mention the English f'ing language!? Sheeeeeit!
...Why don't you guys get off your DUFFS and doing something for a change.
, Director Comey just qualified as Clinton's Secretary of Home Land Security.
@RalphLabar tell your friends enough being sore losers and unite. Or America you love will be rewritten
@Yehudi3 
Oops! Well benefit of doubt gone! Comey has no standing...
@SenTedCruz
but does not this adm. rewite a lot of laws
Why not? #TheJackass re-writes law all the time (immigration, gun control, Obummercare)
@peddoc63 clearly, and yet all that will happen is we'll complain on twitter, meantime Clinton becomes potus
@Dlw20161950 Tell us that what he did was Constitutional, Senator! We have a right to know why this happened!!
you and Comey both are liars.  You said you would support the nominee but have not. Lost all credibility and are done.
So disappointing.  Starting to feel like there's no hope of regaining our country.  I feel sorry for our children.
Got impeachment?
How did you loose to a even crazier nut case Trump?
You are a right wing nut case
Comey said HRC too dangerous as prez; too careless & can't be trusted w top secret info. Corruption seeped in FBI
The phrase was "extremely careless."  Like the way you mischaracterize the director's words:  not a crime. just stupid.
@Cgerm1 can you know put your feelings aside it, and back the only person who can beat Hillary
@terrygossett huh
@mikepfingston2 and it will come back to haunt them in nov
what has happened to this country. I want to know why
@TXIndepndnt1836 Rewritten, I'd say ignored. It wasn't his call, just look to Obama
a presidential response...thanks. hope to see more on every issue to follow up the dunce response.
I suppose we can all get away with anything NOW!!! YOU GOP r useless if you let this go- Seriously!
Comey pulled a John Roberts
.@SenTedCruz Interpreted, maybe? Based on facts and circumstances? And concluded that there's no crime? Isn't that the way the system works?
He didn't want to be a footnote in history! He bent over for the Clintons!
So DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

 @Wodeshed
Impeach him.
impeach Obama or step down!
How does the Director of FBI rewrite law? This must not stand. OUTRAGEOUS!
he's also completely destroyed his reputation. hope it was worth it to you @FBI #Comey
.@SenTedCruz @dunn_cheri Clinton is above the law. We all know this.
#DeleteYourAccount
so do something SENATOR
But why?
: Enough of this undocumented Muslim president Obama and his administration.
Democrats will destroy the Constitution if Hillary is elected president.
impeach him.
Damn right he has
Invite him up to the Hill to answer how extreme carelessness is not gross negligence.
come on Senator who among you all have the balls to put that woman where she belongs. Or just stop being so nice about it!
he didn't rewrite it he simply ignored it
Who would have thought our legal system could be totally undermined by 2 corrupt people, Bill & Hillary Clinton.
Can you do anything about this?  Can you assemble a committee?
Comey is a chump...just like John Roberts.
this is the time to shine unite 4 Trump so we can stop the Clinton dynasty.this Navy veteran is pissed
Step aside Mister, Ted is THE ONLY ONE who's tried to do something, for several years.
@laamigable21 This sounds familiar to me. Let's see...um Obamacare @SCOTUS??? Justice Roberts?? I am sickened
please stand behind @realDonaldTrump so we the people do not have to endure a HRC presidency
When injustice becomes law resistance becomes duty "Thomas Jefferson"
Well, Sen. cruise do something about it demand a grand jury
Loretta Lynch could still prosecute, right? Doubtful.
When will republicans accept that they tried and failed at attacking Hillary?  Move on. Do the job you all were elected to do.
God, I wish you people could play politics on an intelligent level
senator cruz, this is why you need to support trump and quit playing games.
His family probably got threatened and he was told what to say. Very disappointed in Comey today
@marklevinshow 
Well said
Coney has taken a play out of John Roberts playbook for elites.  Roberts ignored the will of Congress, Comey ignored the law!
I spent time 7/4 reading the Dec of Ind and this travesty is addressed to King Geo as Rule of man not law, The shame we share!
Good on you Sen Cruz. This resonates to the absolute integrity of the FBI and its Director.
It is only rewritten until someone else does the same thing. Then they will go to jail.
The Clintons are all about 'intent' - to get more power, more wealth.
Impeach him.
bullsh*t...the GOP is just mad because they've tried to cram a scam/smear down Americans' throats. We aren't buying it.
No. Please no. You cannot defend her. This is beyond partisan games.
Get used to saying President Clinton again.
under no circumstances will a criminal be my president
U won't be. She's not a criminal.  U might want to watch what U say online; else U may find some1 on UR doorstep.
Oh, geez, I should have known U were a Tea Party idiot, lol.
I appreciate the insults from someone who is unable to form coherent sentences or understand an FBI director.
Perhaps #Comey was reading the federal law for Democrats. Hillary is probably on double secret probation as we tweet.
#NothingNewForThisGang
yes he did.
To the detriment of a country "Ruled by Law" not Men
Impeach for deriliction.  Of duty
Can Congress do anything about this?
