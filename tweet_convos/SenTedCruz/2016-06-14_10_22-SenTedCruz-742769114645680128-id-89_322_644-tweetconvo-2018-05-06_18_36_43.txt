Interesting, as no legislation exists stating that requirement
I'm still waiting for you to show me the legislation supporting you.

Unless you are gay, muslim or any other group you don't like in your wishlist to take away rights.
Ever heard of taxation without representation? Every gay person in your district is experiencing that.

#SafeSpace anyone? I suspect "Brave" is becoming relative.
We welcome your compassion toward gay people.
We are less and less the home of the free or the home of the brave.
Freedom in America is an #Illusion. The rulers do not want a #WellInformedPeople they want #Lemmings
