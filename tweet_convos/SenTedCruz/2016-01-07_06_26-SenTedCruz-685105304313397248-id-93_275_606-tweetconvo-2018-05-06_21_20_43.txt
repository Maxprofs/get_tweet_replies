@SenTedCruz We're going to kill sick people in 2017!
@AnotherEitan are you going to pay my bills just because I live a healthy lifestyle and I'm healthy? AssHole!
@ftcubbi Considering how many times you tweeted the same thing at people, I'm doubting the mental part of your "healthy" claim.
@AnotherEitan your a hater. If you want to give away your money write a check. Don't try to tax my money for someone else's bills!
@ftcubbi You want no societal contract? No community support? Go live in a 3rd world country or on a boat in the middle of an ocean.
@AnotherEitan we've had enough of your social experiment socialism doesn't work!
@ftcubbi @AnotherEitan Forrest is a waste of time
@maxrafaelwaller @AnotherEitan All you socialists move the F to Europe!!
@SenTedCruz because fuck the millions of people with new health insurance.
@seymorebutts_ @SenTedCruz are you going to pay my bills just cuz I live a healthy lifestyle and I'm healthy?
@ftcubbi @SenTedCruz I'm in my mid 20s and haven't had a claim in 3 years so you're not going to get any sympathy from me

@SenTedCruz Thank you for voting to repeal ObamaCare!!!
@SenTedCruz Can't wait to see how you'll REPLACE Obamacare.  I'm sure you've got some fabulous, inexpensive way to insure millions #sarcasm#
@SenTedCruz every time you fight it republican law firms make Millon's off the tax payer so ask yourself why they keep fighting it  $$$
@SenTedCruz your not even eligible to be in the Senate much less the office of the President. Neither is Obama
@SenTedCruz keep it going Senator!
@SenTedCruz yup... Step in the right direction
@SenTedCruz And lobbying by Big Insurance companies
@SenTedCruz so are you guys planning on trying to run it back through and veto Obama's veto? If you don't try, you aren't serious about it.

@SenTedCruz @DMRegister @tedcruz @mattpatane #CreepyCruz #DominionistLoon #SenPaisleyBathrobe
@SenTedCruz Sorry to hear UR right to run for POTUS challenged. Best to resolve up front as man in FL said planned to challenge IF nominated

@SenTedCruz sorry sen Cruz, not impressed with the do nothing republicans, they should have defund it long time ago.
@SenTedCruz Pure forme! Dead on arrival to Obama'desk Alloing big mpney to Obama was a huge treason of the conservative americans
@SenTedCruz funding PPH Obama care last month then passing a bill know will be vetoed is NOT leadership. It's disingenuous
@SenTedCruz Was nothing but a Burt covering exercise to try to placate the voters. GOP already fully funded Obama's desires.
@SenTedCruz LOL!!!!! What a joke.
@SenTedCruz About time! Nevermind that our law makers, which represent US and our will, is going to be over ruled by a tyrant through veto
@SenTedCruz 4 the 75th time! When is Congress going 2 start doing their job?
@SenTedCruz NOW TELL THEM TO PUT SANCTIONS ON IRAN
@SenTedCruz oh Ted I'm a supporter of yours but defending this show vote after funding OCARE fully is GOPe to the hilt #maybetrump
@SenTedCruz It seems like a huge waste of time as you know it will get vetoed.

@SenTedCruz  the GOP has had the opportunity to do this for a few years.
@SenTedCruz Step taking. Should have been done in 2015.
@SenTedCruz Just like the other rePUGS, I see. Screw Americans!
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz what is screwing Americans is the obscure cost of our health care.Obummer care needs to go! Forcing it on us is a joke.
@CincinRS @SenTedCruz Too bad you don't believe the truth of it working. That's not to say there could be improvements.
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz improvements..  let's just call the scrap yard.
@CincinRS @SenTedCruz Ain't gonna happen, hon. This is a grandstanding stunt by the GOP. They know it & are only pandering to your kind.
@SudokuG @SenTedCruz seriously, Hon.. Go drink that liberal bs kool-aid
