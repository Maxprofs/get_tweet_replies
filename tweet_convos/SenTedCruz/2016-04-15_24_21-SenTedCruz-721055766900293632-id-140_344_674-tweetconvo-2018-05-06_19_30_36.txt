@SenTedCruz Flat tax is another GOP scam which helps the rich and hurts the working class. Do your homework Canadian. #GoBack
@sentedcruz the Bush tax cuts cost us a few trillion dollars, remember?  #NeverCruz
@zezzledog @SenTedCruz No. Tax revenue went up during Bush
.@fltruckerfrank  One source :
@zezzledog
.@fltruckerfrank Of course.  Thomas Sowell.
@zezzledog read your own story, after tax cuts stimulated economy, revenues went UP.
@SenTedCruz The flat tax actually raises rates on the poor and middle class and lowers them on the rich.
@JWingspread @SenTedCruz Obviously, you haven't looked at the tax plan.Everyone should pay something but Cruz exempts way too many.FAIRTAX!
@PlanBBiz4U Should EVERYONE pay something? If you make minimum wage and can't afford your rent, you should also pay taxes?
@odulzaides @SenTedCruz Pretty sure it woke up many more Americans to make the transfer to the Trump train. #Trump2016

VA and Obama administration exposed for corrupt business practices
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump why does ted cruz's facial expression always look like that his just farted & is enjoying the smell.....
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump who's cause?
You know the flat tax will benefit 1%ers and they won't pay taxes? Guess who pays difference...ALL WORKING CLASSES.
@SenTedCruz nope wrong
@SenTedCruz yeah, because that trickle-down Reagan crap has worked so well for most Americans #YouLie
@SenTedCruz Keep up your dirty backdoor delegate manipulation and see where it gets you! The American people don't want you! #Trump2016
@SenTedCruz Are you 12
@SenTedCruz Each administration creates security for themselves (nature) what's good for all at present and future (nurture).
@SenTedCruz   Sometimes it's good to speak with conviction. Federal reserve won't compromise forever!

@SenTedCruz Simple should mean 1 tier!
@SenTedCruz #GoodByeCruz
@SenTedCruz u win by cheating. You say u understand americans who are sick of the estasblishment. DUH u are the establisment!
@SenTedCruz #fairfax is better and everyone should pay something. Both plans have too many exemptions.
@SenTedCruz Make that a graduated flat tax, with the wealthy paying a higher rate than the poor and the middle class, and it'll be a keeper!
@SenTedCruz flat tax is not a new idea and will not work, trust me Ted
@apwf1956 @SenTedCruz True. Only FAIR Tax will work. As long as there is an Income tax there will be corruption and we'll be back here again
@SenTedCruz How about all those Corporations , American mind you , that have HQ's in foreign lands so they don't pay Billions in tax???
@Patrickm55P @SenTedCruz His tax reform will fix that so they'll want to bring it all back home.
@SenTedCruz 8 years of Bush it never worked.  But keep bangin the drum for the wealthy Ted.
@SenTedCruz what about your responsibility to the people to VOTE in the capacity you were elected.
@SenTedCruz The rich are mostly responsible for the $19 trillion of debt; they should pay it off! Learn what it means to be a good Christian
@SenTedCruz "Flat Tax" is euphemism for "Big Tax Cuts for the Rich"!!!
@SenTedCruz sometimes the solution to a problem is not a straight line.
@SenTedCruz a straight line can easily be predicted and intercepted. Stay strong and smart Senator! The Spirit continues to guide you.
@SenTedCruz Thumbs up
@SenTedCruz @SpeakerRyan @TreyGowdy @JasonChaffetz Flat Tax-= Get Rid of: IRS +No Bonuses>UN>Obamacare>Ability to fire Govt Employees #tcot

@SenTedCruz #lyinTed is at it again.
@SenTedCruz .lyin Cheater ted. Your the cry baby. You have to have delegates given to you. No voters. Americans are tired of hacks like you!
@SenTedCruz The delegates deciding for us is not how it's supposed to be,that is not America
@SenTedCruz last time I checked the PEOPLE DECIDE Through their right to vote, not the delegates.
@SenTedCruz when the candidate originally won that state in the primary, this is rigging the system so the GOP can have who THEY want ,
@SenTedCruz the delegates should not be allowed to hold a convention to steal delegates away from another candidate
@SenTedCruz if a candidate wins a district in the primary that should be the end of it period
@SenTedCruz the delegates are pulling some shady stunts on your behalf! It's totally wrong!
IF you want to win this election, please start talking about the New World Order Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030 @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Abolish the IRS. We can do it! https://amp.twimg.com/v/e9e6934b-fed6-4f2f-b255-953cc8e17f53 … …
@patriot101 @SenTedCruz It isn't simple enough. Still too many exemptions. Everyone MUST have skin in. FAIR Tax is only way to Abolish IRS.
@SenTedCruz Why is it Ted wins elections requiring "relationships" even tho Trump says "everyone hates Cruz"?
@SenTedCruz I approve this message
@SenTedCruz hey
@SenTedCruz Trump doesn't take dictation from lobbyists, he can Make America Great Again
@SenTedCruz bla bla you will say ant hug Lyin Ted your going down
@SaintGoar @Andy35603 @SenTedCruz Where on earth did you get that idea? He has never "believed in abortion"! Something Trump said? He lies.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz lowering Congress's salaries would help too.
@SenTedCruz If we could only have a 13.8% tax rate like @BernieSanders paid in 2014
@SenTedCruz you get your monthly check from the government you are one of them think people
@SenTedCruz That wouldn't happen to go with deregulation and causing a crash like the one in 1929 or 2008, would it? #LearnYourHistory
@SenTedCruz http://nutbarfactor.com/2016/04/15/facts-have-surfaced-about-ted-cruzs-college-days-that-he-is-petrified-will-cost-him-the-nomination/ …
@SenTedCruz The average America's effective tax rate is 10% already.  The flat tax would raise taxes for the half below average.
@SenTedCruz So Trump didn't know he rules in Colorado? Fair election?? Here were their rules. Your all crooks.
@SenTedCruz 
IT'S TIME TO DECENTRALIZE SOME OF THE BIG COUNTER PRODUCTIVE GOVT. DESIGNED TO DESTROY SELF GOVERNANCE &CREATE DEPENDENCY
@SenTedCruz And, the high U.S. business tax rates should be lowered to a flat 20% to bring back trillions of dollars from overseas.
@SenTedCruz Love it! Must include a provision to prevent Congress from increasing the rate, putting us right back in the pickle we're in.
@SenTedCruz
It's time for a 0 tax rate!   It's time to repeal the 16th & 17th ammendments.
@SenTedCruz @ChuckNellis 跟着我说，跟着感觉走。那是没错的啊。
@SenTedCruz It's actually overtime for taxation reform.  No retirement for me.
@SenTedCruz Sure, but a flat tax only works when you take away schedule A.
@SenTedCruz @annepaezNOLA
@SenTedCruz Unseal your records or drop out now!

 #VoteTrumpNewYork 
@SenTedCruz Yeah 10% flat tax and 16% sales tax devastating to retirees that have saved a few bucks AFTER paying all taxes will pay 16% more
@SenTedCruz again lets take the power away from gov't thru IRS to take our tax $ to give to illegals in order to replace us with them
@SenTedCruz TRUMP plan suppose to benefit the most across the board...JOBS go w TRUMP
@SenTedCruz If we get a tax plan from the good Lord. The plan will be beneficial to everyone!!! Especially the poor. The widows and orphans
@SenTedCruz with this type of flat tax. Does the poor pay the same taxes as the rich? There is no way possible!!! God has always helped poor
@SenTedCruz You can't pay off bills if you have no income!
@SenTedCruz but lowering taxes for whom, exactly? yours/others' tax plans favor the wealthy, who are more likely to save, not spend those $
@SenTedCruz #doyourjob #kochbrotherspuppet

@SenTedCruz https://www.pscp.tv/top_pix/1yoKMmveYMdKQ …
@SenTedCruz of all the things I disagree with from Cruz, this is the one of the issue's I can agree upon.
@SenTedCruz  TED CRUZ, JOE MCCARTHY WANNABE , DELUSIONAL DISHONEST DECEITFUL TEA PARTY TRASH .
@SenTedCruz simply cutting taxes does not work. U r proposing more supply side economics Voodoo! Ask David Stockman
@SenTedCruz I remember how tax cuts were to drive business and prosperity for all. It failed
@SenTedCruz why not vote on the most researched legislation in U.S. History and implement the FAIR TAX  #FairTaxUpForAVote
@SenTedCruz if you become Pres. Please don't go on Hannity -- his blatant favoritism to Donald is unprofessional.
@SenTedCruz *sing-songy* sounds like someone's got a hand up their ass
@SenTedCruz Agreed!!!
@SenTedCruz No ObamaCare, lower taxes, more secure borders stopping illegal immigration, a strong foreign policy. #TedCruzhasmyvote
@SenTedCruz Ugh. Have we learned nothing from history.
@SenTedCruz it's time to put someone in the White House that'll get this country back on track. #Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz madness. The elite use more of gods resources, they should pay more tax.

@SenTedCruz Just trying to give the rich more money ? If you don't get it, will you throw another tantrum and shut down the Gov ?
@SenTedCruz Bush's 10 year Tax Cut for the Rich; cheap gimmick to redistribute even more wealth to the Rich; about $6.6 Tril over 10 years.
@SenTedCruz With excess productive capacity; Corporation's not adding jobs now. Tax cut just another Gift Horse for the Wealthy.
@SenTedCruz not for the common citizen rafa! sorry! the wealthy have ways around it and you know it!
@SenTedCruz Senator, flat tax good idea, but how can we lower taxes with national debt > $19.2 trillion?
@SenTedCruz Plain bull shit. GWB gave rich largest tax in ten year period between 2002-2012; costing Treasury $6.6 Tri.& got 0 net new jobs!
@SenTedCruz Both of Cruz's suggestions have been criticized by Tax Foundation as shortening or reducing Revenue substantially; tax cut Rich!
@SenTedCruz I'll take 10% any day
@SenTedCruz I will never vote for you
@SenTedCruz Amen! #PrayForCruz
@SenTedCruz no new taxes are good ,please revise Obama care insurance rates skyrocketing ,very bad for economy
@SenTedCruz  Would Be Interesting To See How The Shifts At A National Level Affect The State Level Taxes.
@SenTedCruz #CruzSexScandal #DaddyCruz #CrepyCruz #DominionistLoon #SenPaisleyBathrobe
@SenTedCruz A simple tax plan from a simple man #cringeface
@SenTedCruz I prefer Fair Tax, but as long as IRS is gone, I'm good!
@SenTedCruz If you don't fix trade imbalances, lowering tax rates will be like a band-aid on a gunshot wound.
@SenTedCruz Yeah, a flat tax is the fairest tax. But for a truly fair tax the Fed gov must be greatly reduced in size
.@SenTedCruz lol for sure man
@SenTedCruz lolol Deep
@SenTedCruz Drop out like you told Kasich to when he lost the mathematical path. Voters have spoken.
@SenTedCruz Anyone serious about liberty would completely abolish the income tax.  #TaxationIsTheft
@gershw1n @SenTedCruz Taxation is theft, but what Ted's planning is at least equal - with no loopholes.
@Velanestar @SenTedCruz A flat tax is certainly better than a progressive tax.  But, a more palatable tyranny is still tyranny nonetheless.
