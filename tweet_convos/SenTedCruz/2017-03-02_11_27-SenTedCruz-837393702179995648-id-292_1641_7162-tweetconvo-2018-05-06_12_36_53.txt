I wonder what the Democrats are going to accuse Rick Perry of?
And learn how to spell, it's bye bye.  Where are you from Texas?
Awesome. Now shut it down.
just curious, if we shut down Dept of Energy, who do you think would manage/handle Nuclear technology?
All weaponizable material should be supervised by the Defense Dept, one would think eh?
that's not the only thing invoked w/nukes. You really should educate yourself more.
If you want to have a Dept of Energy that *only* oversees fissionable material, fine.
First Democrats delay, then they obstruct. It won't be long before they are calling for Perry's resignation! Don't be bullied!
where were you the last eight years?
Watching Dems skate through email scandals,$ scandals, conflict of interest, and abandoning our people in Benghazi then lying
@Veteran4Trump Congrats Mr. Secretary Perry!!
finally 
he does know what department he will be heading, right?
assuming that he knows what his job is.  He didn't even know nuclear weapons were part of the department.
well what will they tear into him for? The bunch of hypocrites and socialist thugs! Congrats to Mr. Perry
EVERYTHING IS BIGGER IN TEXAS. @Peden77 @n_tomlinson19
@Veteran4Trump just wait and see...dems will start a whole new campaign to discredit Perry
Congratulations  Governor Perry!!!! @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump @GovernorPerry @POTUS @FoxNews @seanspicer @mike_pence
How unfortunate for us.
@Veteran4Trump Congratulations, Secretary Perry.  Now abolish the DOE.
Another Trump bozo without a clue
what a joke
Great Governor of Texas who knows how to deal with energy
Just a hunch but I'm guessing Schumer will come out & say Perry was lassoing cattle with Russians last week.
he bought a roller dog at a gas station once.  Clearly colluding with big oil.
or big sausage?  Um....wait.....
@SecretaryPerry He just spoke at Energy & every1 is impressed! Wow! Entered the room w/ "Howdy" & ended speech w/ "God Bless You".
I'm sure he had a visit with the russians.....
@SenTedCruz God help the environment!!!
Congrats Secretary Perry!!
drain the swamp
..Good..Finally!! Now let's get on with the fracking & most of all..."drill baby drill".
Congratulations
@SenTedCruz   I hope he can remember where his office is
so he's out of a job now?
Just remind him tomorrow would ya .
Perry is a good man.
wish Rick had a more meaningful position in the government. They are going to defunk the department of energy?
Good now get rid of it
hope he don't get comfy in his new position. The Dems will be wanting him to resign soon. Stupid rocks.
Drain the swamp!
Terrific pick by Prez Trump. Will reverse some of the idiotic BO actions.
@SenTedCruz Breaking, he's already under inditement and has resigned in disgrace. #MAGA ?
He was a good governor for Texas and will be a great Secretary of Energy.
concur
Can things get any worse?  Oh yes - probably next week.
I wish him much success!
@Nurse_Nett Congratulations to Governor Rick Perry. Again a very good choice by President Trump.
Very cool @RickPerry420 and CONGRATS! We welcome you and trust you will do an outstanding job!
next week we find out he met with the Russians
GOOD. CAN OUR ELECTRICITY COME DOWN NOW PLEASE
@ChaseCherub @FoxNews he's an idiot but dept of energy isn't over oil and gas. He's now in charge of nuclear arsenal. Now you can be scared
What a disgrace to this great country!
About darn time!
Katy Perry need a brain MRI to check if the skull is empu
Now he needs to shut her down.  #GetItDone
@LoveuLynn He's a good man that will do a great job for America.
love @RickPerry420 we the people living be Rick perry
can Rick Perry ride a lightening bolt to work? That would be so cool.
Another corrupt crook!
Until Pelosi and friends accuse him of once watching a Russian television show.
don't ask him to look after more than 2
Wow! So many mindless idiots congratulating this mindless idiot. Has no biz running DOE. Did they not hear him at GOP debates?!?!
@realDonaldtrump,@FoxNews ,Nebraska's Tecumseh Prison is rioting again!, & a fire was set 2 hrs ago..State Troopers arriving in Riot gear!
oh God, I hope he never spoke to a Russian! They will get ya!
He replaces a physicist. 
bboooooo
finally!!
What a joke. And what a perfectly representative example of the Trump administration as a whole: zero qualifications for the job.
who?
great
What took the Democrats so long?? OBSTRUCTION.
oh the dept he was going to demolish if he became president but couldn't remember the name of it
congratulations Governor Perry. Do us proud
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/rick-perry-oops-energy-department-2016-12 â€¦
KUDOS Gov Perry! BTW, you r a good dancer too!
isn't that the department he said he wanted to get rid of? But also didn't actually know what they did? #swampthang
it's about time
BARF. This oil hound wants nothing to do with conserving natural resources, he's burning em up as we speak.
he's an idiot but dept of energy isn't over oil and gas. He's now in charge of nuclear arsenal. Now you can be scared.
Alright now let's get to work and help bring the US debt down.
How many illegal aliens will he have working for him?
hope he learned the different branches of the government #RickPerry
Congrats!
another unqualified pick for the cabinet. DeVos,Pruitt are the other 2 not qualified. What a bunch of losers.
congratulation Gov.
Watch out Governor, you'll be the next one the libtards come after!
ho hum
@SenTedCruz Bad news for us!
Congratulations Gov. Perry!  TX is proud of you!
Rick Perry - let the abolishing begin... 

.@FoxNews
<--- Has no clue what the Dept of Energy does.
FINALLY!!
CONGRATULATIONS Mr. Perry
perry with a bachelors degree in animal husbandry. O.o you all can't deny that there's something really shady going on here. O.O
interesting though that under obama we had nuclear physicists with PHDs and nobel prize winners running the dept and now it's
which would be why he wanted to destroy the dept of energy. O.o
he has zero education about the dept except that they must've tried to stop him when something was shady that he was about to sign.
signing his name & giving permission to oil & other energy companies to do whatever they want w/out him knowing what he signed.
if most people think devos is unqualified, perry seems even less so.  you all must see that i hope at FN.  his experience is
@RickPerry
Congrats to Gov. Perry on Texas Independence Day at that !
How AWESOME is that ??!!
boy, can't wait to see how Obama tries to set Perry up!
won't be long before DNC & NYT find a link with the Russians & ask for his resignation. No one will escape DNC wrath.
I dont believe #rickperry is #bestcandidate since he streamlined approval process for #coalfiredplants not utilizing #retrofitting
yea! Nice when senators do the job they voted to do!
@Bikers4Liberty boooooi
Excellent!
@SenTedCruz FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
#congratulationsRickPerry
God bless you Mr Perry
@obama_speech

#Congratulations Mr. Perry!
Congratulations to Secretary Perry, look forward to having him as our Secy of Energy!!!

He'sAfighter/respected/positiveTRACKrecord-largestStateInUSA!!

DemsDOyourJobBeGOOD
citizens! IrresponsibleAction
createdunrest!!!
majority of trumps appointees have been on a stepping down spree. perry might follow suit in days to come
@HeyTammyBruce Hope he never talked to a Russian!!!!!
@SenTedCruz has he ever talked to a Russian or looked at Wilkileaks? The democrats must investigate
No surprise there. Slick Rick has alot of Texas money and friends behind him. I'm sure a few favors will be called.
until they find out he had a few Vodka tonics, then they'll scream he's a russian stooge and traitor.
slowly but surely taking our country back!
ITS ABOUT TIME.. sleepwalking DEMS obstractionistst there is nothing good in the mind of a liberal these days
@HeyTammyBruce ~Great! Now downsize it right out of existence. #CampaignPromise
Dept of Energy is over nuclear arsenal which trump wants to increase.not getting downsized.Try to keep up
Congrats!
@SenTedCruz @FoxNews What's happening with Gorsuch? He needs to be confirmed asap. #confirmgorsuch   #SessionsRocks #GoCruz
And,to you guys,this is a cause of celebration? Why,I ask?
The guy,despite his bespectacled look,has the IQ of an ant! Damn!
he didn't even know what the department was. Now he is over nuclear arsenal and these idiots are celebrating. 
Great now someone has to explain to Perry what the job is. He thinks he'll be working with Homer Simpson and is super excited
like Hillary setting up server in bathroom in her house,  did not think that was wrong, dumb B..ch
Hillary using a private server was wrong . Don't know what that has to do with tweet about Rick Perry
@SenTedCruz lol.
Congrats Sec Perry!
Stupid is as stupid does.
I thought Sonic was just a game!
It's about time! Couldn't these obstructionist morons have held him out a little longer for the good of the country! What a circus!
great news

@SenTedCruz 45 with the codes, and C to a degree Rick with the maintenance. What could possibly go wrong?
Good news! @GovernorPerry was an EXCELLENT pro-jobs governor 4 #Texas, he will be a FANTASTIC Energy Secty. Congrats to him! #MAGA
Are you on drugs?
Congratulations Governor! Or is it Mr. Secretary? You know what I mean.
...and @SenSchumer immediately calls for his resignation also. Will this man ever stop?
cool. First thing you do is shut it down! 
Finally! Cabinet appointees being confirmed at a snail's pass due to the libs still have not accepted their loss.
From a nuclear physicist to a Dancing With the Stars has been.
time 4 the libturds 2 turn their attention 2 Perry & come up w/ false accusations & create another distraction from the true issues
Wonder how much money that Russian was Pd to set up meeting with AG. All a big set up, watch out for evil Dems.
this is absolutely wrong that these Dems don't just go away w/ an ounce of dignity or grace. Such hypocritical losers!
they r out for blood, CNN, Franken/ dems set Sessions up, this is war, we must open our eyes!
award for least intelligent administration goes to...
@SenTedCruz #repealandreplacetedcruz2018 #foxisveryfakenews
What did he forget oops
@SenTedCruz Finally!
Congratulations Rick Perry! #AmericaFirst!
Congratulations Rick!!
@SenTedCruz Has he learned what the position is responsible for yet? #DancingRick #TexasBimbo
@LGBT_Activist he's worthless.
and .... 3,2,1
CNN reports WH source says Perry talked to Russia
Must remove .... for the good of the country!!!
@SenTedCruz Hopefully #gorsuch soon. The Democrat filibuster has been way OTT.
@SenTedCruz Next Schumer and Pelosi will say he sold the Russians gasoline.

Good and now he can start dismantling uh, uh, what was that third department?
Perry is totally unqualified but so is our president
just like Obama, community organizer, non citizen, muslim, talk about qualified 
Congratulations.
Finally
Watch your back
Excellent! Do as well in your new endeavors as you did for Texas & USA wins....again.
I was beginning to think he "got rid of it" before he had to figure out how to manage it.
this speaks volumes about trump. .their fight is over now let's #MAGA
I'm still paying $250 a gal down from $500 that OBUM had it at OBUM said he wanted $20 per gallon if he could get away with it
Is this the "Dancing with the Stars" guy?
about time!
well something VI's moving finally from Congress
FINALLY ABOUT TIME THEY DO THEIR JOB AND PUT OUR CABINET THROUGH!
Breaking news is your support for Russian dictator
