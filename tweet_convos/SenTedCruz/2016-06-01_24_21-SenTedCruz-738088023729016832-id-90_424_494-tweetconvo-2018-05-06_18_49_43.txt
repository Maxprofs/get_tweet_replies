@LibertyNow10 @SpeakerRyan  Congress has Power of the Purse, where are they?
Why we need ->@SenTedCruz for president @SpeakerRyan #WriteInCruz
And you continue to cry about it without having an answer, so why should you stay in office?  We don't need a cry baby in office
@tgradous why hasn't congress stopped this
@HiCaliberLilGal   Great job guys !!!  Thanks for pretty much NOTHING !!!  Watchdogs my ass !!!
@SuzieQt154320 Congress holds the purse strings, why are they writing the checks for the illegal pay outs?!?!
this administration ignores the constitution and the congress does nothing. We need leaders like you and @marcorubio
Do we even have a Congress anymore?  Let's see; didn't they abdicate a couple of years ago? Somebody must run the Govt!
Robert Triplett @SenTedCruz You need to be Trump's VP.Together you could beat Hillary.Please consider.
isn't it time you all did what you were hired to do?
@RestoreHistory Congress needs to get it's act together & stop him!
@Dlw20161950 How many times has BO broken his OWN BOcare Law?
Where is the House? They're supposed to manage the money we wend to Washington.
@_Becky_T @WSJPolitics only you & a few others are working for us, thanx Ted.
What are you doing about it ?
Why has he not been impeached is the better question? #ImpeachmentDay #ImpeachObama
Keep ObamaCare, tax Democrats only "Dems Bleeding Heart Tax" @ 25% of income. Watch Democrats jump ship.
why has Congress continued to fund Obomacare?
And there's no presidential candidate talking about it. There was one, and the people weren't ready to face the truth.
and this bothers how? We all know this! Perhaps u should think about working with what fate has given u rather than what u seek
@WSJPolitics Well is Congress going to stop him?
@DeepSouthProud IMPEACH #Obama!
@WSJPolitics Then somebody need to go to jail.
you are a loser. #bigly
Stop whining and DO SOMETHING about it @CNN @FOXNews
@JMac1766 You're a puppet.
@WSJPolitics ok, then why does congress allow it?
Really, why haven't you repealed "ObamaCare"?  Oh, you did 50+times and failed. Why don't you put that effort into fixing it?
Thank you God for Ted Cruz.   He fights for everyone of us every day.
do not endorse trump no matter what happens. if you do you will never be elected again to any office.
Ur leadership &uncompromising stand against BHO's unlawful/unconstitutional ACA speaks volumes about u & ur value 2the Republic.
.@SenTedCruz Really? I wonder how many seniors, vets and poor filed bankruptcy because they used money on TrumpU?
@WSJPolitics THE PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE FIXED. PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TOO MUCH FOR BAD COVERAGE
And what is Congress doing about that? It's not enough to point out his illegal acts. We KNOW.
This admin continues to illegally spend billions in #Obamacare subsidies not appropriated by Congress. #FullRepeal http://on.wsj.com/24j8qkq 
then maybe you should do something about it.
My wife and myself voted for you.  You would have been a thousand times better than what we are stuck with.
@MStuart1970 and you and all other R senators keep letting him get away with it. All talk and no action Ted
Why is it rich GOP people want to take away health care from the poor & working poor? We need a one payer health care system!
@instapundit â€”>Largest Texas Insurer Wants To Raise Obamacare Premiums By 60%
So what are you going to do about it
how is it possible? How can one tyrant have do much power? Where is the media?
why is King Obama so obsessed with getting health care to poor people?? Surely there Goldman Sachs wife can insure them???
well stop it , get with the house and Get R Done .. talking "aint" working encourage the States to pull together and stop it
Yes, because we know the Republicans want that money to go on corporate welfare instead of on poor people who need it.
When did Congress lose the Power of the Purse? Oh, Jan. 2009.
He can still be impeached.
I am tired of the theatrics. If crimes have been committed, see that the perps are arrested
@WSJPolitics 
Why will Congress not take the money away?.
Take it up with @SpeakerRyan,  Maybe ya'll could start doing your job you were elected to do and not what you want.
what's to fear when you can write your own Ex pardon or sic your dogs (MM/MSNBC/MS media, Soros,Pedesta,IRS,DOJ,SEIU) onto them.
#Jackass.
is there anyone on Earth left who doesn't want to vomit on you let alone trust you or vote for you again? 
@harrisonterri55 @WSJPolitics IF YOU WANT TO REPEAL  support Mr. TRUMP
,I support  Trump I'm on the train
I'm talking about the distinguish gentleman Texas Conservative senator
do i see a FILIBUSTER coming in our future... again?
that what yours and many other job it is to put a STOP to this NS
@WSJPolitics This Senator continues to waste taxpayers dollars trying to repeal popular and successful legislation. #FireTed
Holly cow! I thought this guy had been abducted.
@SenTedCruz
be honest Ted, Just say it... it's vote buying pure and simple... Obama is just like a drug dealer, your first subsidy is free.
@WSJPolitics Yes sir!
thats the problem CONGRESS, NO ACTION REPUBLICAN TEAM!
Yeah, umm mbe if @GOP congress actually showed up & did something. luvd ur healthcare plan... oh right
@WSJPolitics So, then where is the funding coming from if it has been approved by Congress?
Impeach?
shut up Ted.
@WSJPolitics Well Senator, what are you going to do about it???
.@SenTedCruz Thank you Ted.  Keep going.
I wrote you a great song Senator, you never responded, Listen to it  Ted Cruz https://youtu.be/75U-o1lNc8c 
Start the CHANT..OBAMACARE https://youtu.be/uF9p2B7ES5A  OBAMACARE SUCKS U'LL B HEARING FROM US WE R THE PEOPLE FROM THE USA
Then work with Speaker Ryan and exercise  Constitutional prerogatives to correct the situation.
and drs and pharmacists routinely, unethically overcharge state medical assistance that isn't affiliated with obamacare....
esp in low income communities where the recipients of aid are less likely to question what they're seeing #dasracist #title1
@WSJPolitics Tell that to the Americans whose lives have been saved and are healthier.
SEN CRUZ I NEED YOU TO JUMP ON THE FRENCH FERRY AND GET ALL OF #NeverTrump TO COME WITH YOU. BETWEEN ALL 40 OF US DRUMPF IS DONE
y rnt there any arrests?
and why isn't anything being done about it???
