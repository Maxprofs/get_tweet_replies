Sanders, Senate Democrats urge Justice Department to keep up 'climate denial' pursuit http://bit.ly/1XWlqfU 
I truly wish you were born in America. I think you lost to trump because you were born in Canada and not on a military base.
@WashTimes Run, Ted, run!!
So it's 1ST amendment that protects a business's right to lie to the public for profit?  Doesn't seem like founder's intent, eh?
Don't be a fool, egbee. "The Constitution was made only for a moral & religious people. It is ... inadequate to govern any other."
I'm not the one making a mockery of the Constitution by stretching it past the limits of logic to protect corporations.
Seems bullying others to believe something is typical of the 
Right; soon they'll try to destroy the 1st amendment rights.
@Gwwalk14 Failure to HONOR a PLEDGE you made is ..... whats the word I'm looking for, #Dishonorable ?, #Deceitful ? #corrupt ?
#AGW skeptics. Don't use their Orwellian terms to describe reality, please.
@WashTimes TSA at airports on our 4th
@AU_bebe climate denial isn't based on science so criticizing it is not simply justified, it's necessary.  Welcome to science.
@WashTimes Climate deniers in power, elected by scared voters who are brainwashed by Fox News, are an "assault" on the USA.
@WashTimes allowing people to tell lies isn't the first amendment.
Facts so over rated.
Why are you turning your back on the party Sir? You signed a pledge! Now you are aiding the Democrat to win....
@WashTimes sadly our constitution grants you rights to propagate false propaganda; that makes you goebbels, not Bernstein.
@WashTimes Pipe down ex-candidate.
Use of govt power to silence & intimidate climate scientists is a direct assault on the First Amendment
@WashTimes how can you "criticise" climate change, it's a natural occurring phenomenon. It won't respond to your criticisms...
@WhosFibbing @WashTimes @realDonaldTrump
absolute best candidate 4 PREZ 16!Man made climate change a big lie, power grab&control of people!#OnlyCruz working 4 us!
@WashTimes what really is a real assault on the 1st ammendment is not using your common sense Teddy boy
@FC4999HC @WashTimes To prosecute people who disagree is communist action against the people. We have Constitution for a reason
Your an idiot if you can't see that your wealthy friends are destroying our planet. You know you live here also! Get real!
As is the steady refusal of Congress to confirm an EPA chief to herald and enact policy to address its alarming encroachments.
Cruz signed a contract pledging he would support the nominee. Clearly, his word is not his bond.
@WashTimes Mmmmm#ExxonKnew
please find an anchor at the bottom of the ocean and tie yourself to it
next to abortion and gay rights and trangender (not a gender) bathroom's& climate change, the biggest scam throughout history.
@WashTimes But it is a proven science, unlike gender.
are you on crack Ted? Thought u were a Christian but all I have seen & heard. Hmm
@peddoc63 @WashTimes So why hasn't congress impeached the AG for threatening climate change dissenters with prosecution.
@peddoc63 @WashTimes For the record, man-made global warming is a big lie.
Amen! Climate change is not 'settled science'. Before it morphed from 'global warming' deception by East Anglia data proved.
@WashTimes you're right, Ted! 1st Amendment guarantees everyone the Right to be stupid. Even Climate Truthers
NASA Releases Detailed Global Climate Change Projections http://go.nasa.gov/20OVqC7 
@WashTimes
 April 2014, ExxonMobil released a report publicly acknowledging climate change risk for the first time.
@PatriotGinger @WashTimes maybe a tattoo would bring some help to our nation's vets.. looking forward to you being voted out
U have to be a #DumbASS to freely speak that climate change is not real and that world energy consumption is not a factor
@WashTimes POTUS has NO respect for our Constitution. I support a Convention of States.
so Green Climate Fund, Carbon trading, green energy and UN Agenda 2030 is all about saving the planet? NO its about green $$$
Now this I agree with you on!  Absolutely!  They are using this fake Climate Change to get more regulations and enslave us!
The use of govt power to silence ANY OPPOSITION is a Marxist/Commie practice that WON'T BE TOLERATED BY WE THE MAJORITY IN USA!
@WashTimes and the use of your face and lies is direct insult to the great Lord above! #bigly
ABSOLUTELY that's what they do! It's all about control!
@WashTimes  

Exactly Ted, this country has   
Much more to worry about than
Another Faux Crisis !
@WashTimes Lyin Ted knows all about the 1st Amendment.
@WashTimes No, it's like trying to get those who think smoking is healthy to be quiet

@WashTimes Denial is not a river in Egypt. Wake up and stop protecting your fossil fuel friends.
It's similar to how we decided the tobacco industry was breaking the law by covering up the links to cancer.
No, this is about fossil fuel companies who did climate studies, realized climate change was real, and hid it for profit.
There's a difference between silencing and educating, Ted.
How can the use of govt. power silence Mother Nature?
It's a given that like much of the agenda driven, they can never respect opposing views; seems to be the rage now
Yes; Bernie's a lunatic, yet when we finally had a great Constitutionalist to vote for; the vote went to the narcissist. ?crazy
@WashTimes are you still in congress ??? #cruzmistresscrisis
@WashTimes i agree the first amendment is under assault as is the second amendment
@WashTimes First Amendment offers no protection for destroying our planet #idiotsout
@SenTedCruz
@patriot101 He's still working for U.S. while #Trump Tantrums tear Cities apart.
@WashTimes Smoking doesn't cause health problems/lead exposure isn't harmful.
@WashTimes When an industry willfully deceives the public at the expense of our health that should be investigated
So the government doesn't have the freedom of speech?
Ted, you need to take Scalia's place in SCOTUS. That's where you belong.
@WashTimes I agree with Ted Cruz. Corporations should be able to lie about anything, anytime. Just like him.
ask yourself. What's so negative about protecting the enviro. Think of added opportunities for new industries
More Important TrusTed to Lie @SenTedCruz are our Vets dying waiting to see a doctor/be admitted while you hand out soccer balls to illegals
@WashTimes there are warming and cooling cycle's been going through cooling over 10 years when we go through warming cycle
they will start global warming cry again. Man doesn't cause and we can't prevent it you might as well chaise the wind
@WashTimes WAKE UP AMERICA they don't even call it global warming any more because
@WashTimes another reason why the IRS should be put to pasture.No more targeting of individuals.
Hi Senator!  Can you help out this American tech startup?  Please retweet:
@WashTimes you got that right Cruz. It's an all out assault against free speech
@WashTimes You're two faced as a bully goat. This is why you couldn't even beat the Donald. You should retire from politics.
@WashTimes trying to deny Trump the nomination he won fairly is wrong too! And the Bundy Ranch!
.@SenTedCruz, huh? What are you talking about? And what do you know about science? Credentials?
.@SenTedCruz @JosephEach @WashTimes #MrClimateCrisisProselytizer https://m.soundcloud.com/dexter-roy/mr-climate-crisis-proselytizer … #ClimateChangePropheteering
Amen! Don't believe the 97% of scientists believe in climate change , it's based on common core math
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425232/climate-change-no-its-not-97-percent-consensus-ian-tuttle …
@WashTimes you mean like Congress not allowing scientist to testify or consult with our government? That kind of silencing?
@wolvesofamerica @WashTimes to shake your hand for your bravery to stand up for our Constitution with passion
@WashTimes @nasamom01 @peddoc63 @JewhadiTM @Westxgal But Leftists ADORE global warming! Pushes ALL the right buttons for them!
@WashTimes Sad thing is: young Americans are brainwashed to demand that the govt punish doubters of Climate Change. Commies.
. And you sir, used the govt to do the same, shutdown, intimidate, lie, and do great harm.
@wolvesofamerica @WashTimes Senate Cruz PLEASE continue representing this Great ONE of a kind state TEXAS would love to shake
@JackieVasser @WashTimes well said Senator Cruz. I'm with you on that.
@WashTimes Sanders is a direct assault on the 1st amendment!
no
@WashTimes The MAN!! KEEP FIGHTING & PROTECTING THE CONSTITUTION BRO!!
yes it is Senator.
@WashTimes it's like death we can't prevent it 
No matter how safe you are or how well you eat
@wingsnhooves @WashTimes God Bless liberty and Merica
@Jaysen_Sloth Jaysen...come on man
@WashTimes  WAKE UP AMERICA there is weather we get warming and cooling cycle's man can't cause or prevent it.
@WashTimes So I guess if you believe children should eat lead paint chips, your 1st Am right to advocate this should go unchall?
@WashTimes  thanks
@WashTimes I don't believe dems or socialists know that there is a Constitution. I want MY US of America back.
YOUR SO OUT OF TOUCH CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND WE WILL NOT SURVIVE IF NOT TAKEN CARE OF #KOCHSUCKER
not the constitutionalist you claim to be, fraud not protected by 1st Amendment, also profiling of Muslims is unconstitutional
lol
@WashTimes it silences only the spread of inaccurate and incorrect information.
.@SenTedCruz Since when is fraud protected by 1st amendment ?
@WashTimes  that right climate weather issues
@WashTimes I suppose it's ok to use your chairmanship Teddy to bias the climate change hearing testimony... 1st Admt - right?
@WashTimes 
You got it !! Now as Senator to the USA what are you going to do about it?  We can help
Maybe this was part of the Iran deal that Obama has to act like a mullah
Did I miss the memo that said we were implementing the Chinese government's strategy? Where do they get these ideas from?
Ever get the feeling that you & I part of the VERY few that even cares about the Constitution & Bill of Rights, any more?!?
How ironic that gender deniers claim the mantle of "science".  Keep up the fight Ted! There are more of us than you know.
and the World is only 6 thousand years old too- but your right to say it doesn't make it true-take the $ http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/07/3757233/presidential-candidates-fossil-fuels/ …
Wonder if these Senators are invested in some way with the Global Warming Advocates--whether directly or indirectly?
@WashTimes Go away
Freedom of speech doesn´t mean, freedom to lie to your voters to get Super PAC donations. Just sayin.....
and prima facia proof that the evidence is not there, for if it were they would not need #coercion of Fed to make case.
again Sen Cruz u refuse to do your job and vote on Pres Obama Supreme Court nominee.
@WashTimes Ted you are gross to look at
@WashTimes well played senator Cruz you are honorable here

C'mon Sanders
.@SenTedCruz we also hate when power-hungry judicial branch insists evidence be truthful/verifiable when submitted to the Court. #Amurika
Lyin @SenTedCruz hates when that pesky power-hungry government By/For/Of the People expect scientific studies to be truthful & verifiable!
The use of govt power to silence & intimidate climate change believers is a direct assault on the people of US
Actually you're the one trying to stop discussion of the climate change deniers. You're guilty of what you charge.
If you don't want to appear stupid, name your sources for AGW denial, and explain your logic and reasoning, rather than just NO!
Dems are the intolerant Nazis or Commies if their ideology is ever questioned.
You don't say!  How profound. Did you have to go to Harvard to figure that one out?
Bernie is the most  passionate POTUS candidate. But his ideas scare me. Unfortunately millenials don't understand communism.
Unfortunately @Sparky2112r doesnt understand what "Communism" actually means. Democratic Socialism is NOT Communism. Definitions matter
Democratic Socialism?  Now that is a classical oxymoron.
.@Sparky2112r ok, so you don't understand "oxymoron" either. Regardless, "Communism" & "Socialism" are not interchangeable words/ideologies
No one leads to the next one.  So they are not the same, however they are PROGRESSIVE.  Sort of like alcoholism.
especially when it is a hypothesis
always been climate change throughout earth history, need focus preserving mankind. if something happen. Dinosaur
@WashTimes Climate change denial is only one of the many acts of fraud for profit committed by the fossil fuel industry.
@WashTimes not being hyperbolic. You remember Exxon Valdez of course, or, look to the recent gulf disaster.
@WashTimes How many Crimes against humanity will the industry have to commit before you're willing to look critically yourself?
Agreed. Also, Obama has got his priorities wrong. Obama went and played golf after a terrorist attack killed 6 Americans.
Bush killed 5000+ servicemen & woman 4 bs but at least he was white, right.  My god you are stupid. #vasectomy
No you're the stupid one here. Where in this conversation did I or anyone else mention liking Bush's policies?
Thank you for proving my point.  #Deliverance #DuelingBanjosTime
@WashTimes ur right Senator God I wish u were going 2b our next President as a moderate conservative Democrat im hooked on Cruz
@WashTimes 

They voted to remove any dissenting opinion on climate change from our school districts text books in Portland
.@SenTedCruz I'm sure the First Amendment is what you're really worried about. http://bit.ly/1PHyj6u  #moneyinpolitics #whodoyouworkfor
It is abhorrent any government would intimidate someone for their opinion. UnAmerican to the core.
.@Bingo4881514 @SenTedCruz Seriously Cruz is trying to prevent an investigation into possible fraud by the fossil fuel industry, that's all
They should investigate the government grant money going to climate research and it's possible influence.
.@Bingo4881514 @SenTedCruz Yes and I'm sure Ted Cruz would rush to the climate researchers aid in protecting their right to an opinion too
There would be no shortage of big government "true believers" available just in case he was busy.
.@Bingo4881514 @SenTedCruz Ah yes, the mighty researchers will wield their influence. Fear the wrath of #BigGreen
You mean the dweebs that live in fear their grant money will dry up and have to find a job "out there"? Na.
@WashTimes So, what are you folks in the House & Senate going to DO to defend the Constitution?
Too true.
