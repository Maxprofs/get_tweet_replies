@SenTedCruz All Cruz Wants 2 Do is fight 4 his OWN agenda
@SenTedCruz @ProducerKen Why are you still running? You won't win your primary and could never win the general. Don't be this dense.
@davidm17x @SenTedCruz at this time in 2011 Herman Cain was the lead gop candidate.  Cruz still has a chance
@ProducerKen @davidm17x @SenTedCruz those worked up about the polls now are unfamiliar with history. Zeitgeist moment awaits both sides.
@Cdadams4 @ProducerKen @SenTedCruz I'm not talking about polls. I'm saying that based on the candidate.
@davidm17x @ProducerKen @SenTedCruz I was merely responding as a student of politics. Lots of time left in the pole driven primaries.
@SenTedCruz wait, YOU are talking about a "reasonable middle ground"? YOU? You're kidding, right?
@SenTedCruz we can win every fight!  Never give up! Never surrender!
@SenTedCruz usually not when lunatics are involved
@SenTedCruz @WoffordN Rock on, Ted. Love you!
@SenTedCruz we the public should trust a political party that fights among themselves?
@SenTedCruz Ever learn correct English?  What is your point?
@SenTedCruz Yet Ted, you hold extremist positions that even your own party refuses to entertain. You should try a "reasonable middle ground"
@RiskyLiberal @SenTedCruz Those are his reasonable middle ground positions..
.@SenTedCruz --- So - you're illegal AND a Centrist . . .  

@Sassafras_Knob
@SenTedCruz spoken like a true guy who does just the opposite of that.
@SenTedCruz  great job at debate, this Navy veteran just doesn't understand what people see in the left or Hillary. At a complete loss.
@SenTedCruz God Bless #TedCruz all the way to the people's house. The road to the White House is through GOD. #Cruz2016
@SenTedCruz @FreedomChild3 we have so many great candidates and liberals a murderer and a nut case socialist
@SenTedCruz
 Surely not in the Obama administration
@SenTedCruz @NahBabyNah You'll never win anything if you continue to surrender everything, @SenateMajLdr
@SenTedCruz Laughable that Ted the Cuban-Canadian would talk about reason or middle ground.
@SenTedCruz Thanks for that insightful tweet! it's now on my https://www.rebelmouse.com/NahBabyNah/  site http://rbl.ms/1ibLLER 
@SenTedCruz finding a middle ground is what good politics should be about. Put the country first and your politics second.
@SenTedCruz DON'T BELIEVE THIS FALSE PROPHET. CRUZ HAS EVIDENCED HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN MIDDLE GROUND OR http://COMPROMISE.VOTE  HIM OUT.
@SenTedCruz I pray to God thete is
Does @SenTedCruz know what reasonable middle ground is? When he doesn't get his way he has a tantrum & wants to shut down the government!
@JeffMfromSC @SenTedCruz Like Gretzky said, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."
@SenTedCruz @HomunculusLoikm You lose 100% of the fights you don't wage.
You have to be willing to give some to get to middle ground

@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz we must fight for every inch. There is no middle ground. Compromise is our values slipping away it's never to our benefit.
@SenTedCruz you have no idea what middle ground is. Your only option is always crash and burn rather then compromise.
@SenTedCruz Rest assured,Ryan is a Democrat and its fixing to get Ugly for America. We expect Full Amnesty,Citizenship&Voter Registration.
@SenTedCruz You want to Stir the Pot? "We The People" should have the ability to Impeach/Remove anyone in Congress! The POTUS too!
@harleypyrate02 @HarroldWSmith @SenTedCruz Click on me -smiles-
@SenTedCruz So many have broken their Oath of Office. Our Problem is that no one is doing anything about it.
@SenTedCruz We have no representation in WDC. Absolutely none. Time for recall and overhaul
@SenTedCruz @pjfahren 

I AM BEHIND YOU CRUZ!
@SenTedCruz @ChargerGreg2 No, compromising on what the Constitution limits governments authority on is already beyond criminal.
@SenTedCruz Ted Cruz ...and reasonable middle ground ? Since when ? Since never !
@SenTedCruz it's hard to find a middle ground when they hold the platform!
@SenTedCruz #whimper
really odd you're a Senator & don't understand the American form of gov or the Constitution @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz @brithume  like always Brit talking out of his rear end ..  a Win ?
@sentedcruz 
Ted, When will you contrast yourself against Rubio?
That charlatan is a amnesty rat!
