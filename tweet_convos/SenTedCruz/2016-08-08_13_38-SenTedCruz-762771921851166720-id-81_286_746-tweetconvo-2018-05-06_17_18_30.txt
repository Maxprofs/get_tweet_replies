Please put Hildebeast with @SenTedCruz at launch them both into space. They're best pals. @NASA_Orion
please launch him into the sun. Kthnx
does he even believe in spaceflight?
unfortunately @tedcruz @SenTedCruz   doesn't believe in science
that's just a stupid comment.
here ya go, genius https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/18/scientists-criticise-ted-cruz-attack-nasa …
you have nothing to reply with? Sad!
NASA: National AERONAUTICS and SPACE Administration.
Earth Science isn't their place. Tech development is there job.
.@NealBTomlinson *their
sometimes I get in a hurry. Now for your retort...
sometimes I tweet to morons
@SpaceflightIns @NASA_Orion Maybe now @SenTedCruz will finally understand that Global Climate Change is real! #Science
Explain the Little Age, and the falsified data from East Anglia,
yes,yes, beautiful engineering but,,,,,,
how many days are they cramped up in here?
Litteraly me right now
Teddy too bad no one pushed the launch sequence.
@NASA can you just leave him out there in space? For real.
Cruz fights to fund nasa, moron. Obama is the one who cut space funding.
I disagree because that's my opinion and I'm right and you're wrong and ha.
Typical progressive. Ignores the facts and relies on feelings.
My feelings are facts. Facts = Feelings. That is a fact. Look it up.
go take another bong hit, smoky.
I aint smokin no weed, sir. this is the us of a and what i believe is mine and you cant take it
beliefs are for religion. Science has nothing to do with feelings. It's based on facts alone.
@tedcruz This  @NASA_Orion is amazing. I volunter @realDonaldTrump for the first Mars-Shot.
1 way ticket!
looks pretty cramped to me.!!!!!
@SpaceX Dragon is way better!
@elonmusk
Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/NASA_Johnson/status/762749932965097472 … (Ranked 9th for Aug 8.)
so you and your Illuminati friends can fly off to Mars no no no
When can I get a ride back home?
@POsroff @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion When does he blast-off?
He looks the part of an astronaut
quick someone hit the launch button!
no photos of him sucking obamas ass on air force one? That's his new hobby. POS two faced liar.
Looking for those delegates in space?
write my name in those humans as The Captain of the SHIP
Please get him on board and launch him into deep space with no ability to return!
I know.  You progressives hate resistance.
you do realize that you make no sense,  right?
then what's your problem with Cruz?
He is one of the most vile assholes of the modern era.
how so?
OMG.....Don't ask fucking stupid questions.. Just stay in your bubble.
it's an honest question.
stir crazy astronaughts, space?????
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion and the astronauts will pass the idle time reading
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion $20 trillion in debt!!! Please save the $$$ for deep space AFTER we stop destroying our kids!
is he wearing heels? 
When Cruz shut down the government, did NASA employees get paid? No.
bet that was a cool tour @NASA_Johnson @tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion  Glad he didn't blast off! We need him here!
good to know he cares about nasa! Unlike the current president who defunded nasa
It's not just the space program we need but the new technology derived from it.
let us know when you're leaving ted...we'll have a going away party...#bonvoyage
A perk of being an elected official.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion Watch out Aliens your competitor is coming...
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion Actually he is the politician I would least want to launch into space...
never go full nasa
RT @NASA_Johnson: .@SenTedCruz gets an inside look at the @NASA_Orion mockup, our spacecraft that will take humans to deep space. https://t…
does Sen. Cruz believe space exists?
there needs to be a downloadable VR experience for Orion. That would be great!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion Please launch Ted #Raphael Cruz into space right now, one way trip please.
With what money? $19 trillion in debt; we're the brokest nation in history.
I sure hope someone photoshops this.
OK LAUNCH! GO GO GO
Wow..that looks incredible uncomfortable.
give him a free one way ticket..........
Beam me up Scotty. This election cycle shows there is no intelligent life here.
Can we put him underneath the rocket please?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion 
3...2...1...LIFT OFF!
You ppl would be better off doing fishing shows. Cruz is a Joseph McCarthy, Jr.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion Will the dryer hose held on by zip tie be part of the luxury package, or is that standard?
Are we sure this isn't a picture of where he came from #NoCanadian #uspoli #cdnpoli
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion maybe they can ship him to mars
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion in your dreams Ted Cruz
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion How neat! Despite all of the hateful trolling,  I think it's really cool & I support Cruz :)
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion sorry, we shouldn't fund space exploration when we have $19 trillion of debt
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion What a cool experience!  Our space program is awesome.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion Take Hillary instead! she is a space shot.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NASA_Orion book yourself a ride.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE take Teddy. He's worthless here on Earth.
cool!
Too bad someone couldn't press a button and send @tedcruz into deep space.  @CNN @MSNBC
Just like the primaries. Flat on his back.
what has been his record on funding science?
Yes and his knowledge of the planets. Does he refer to Pluto as a planet?
This is the same guy who has said science is a conspiracy to get prayer out of schools.
But before that you'll use a Monkey?
Why don't they just have a rotating seat like Thunderbird 1 for horizontal/vertical flight?
I bet Trump doesn't really care about space travel and Hillary doesn't either
Trump doesn't care about space travel literally and calories in a conspiracy called Earth penal colony
were you able to explain to him that the stars and planets out there are older than 5,000 years?
because Jesus?
you're a fool. Obama is the one who slashed NASA's funding. DUH!!!!
Exactly! My FiL still hasn't found a permanent job after being laid off.
I know.  I live in Houston.... the energy sector is getting hammered too.
It's sad...there's a shopping strip off Nasa Blvd, called Nasa Value Center.
go ahead and send him up please!
Please send ted Cruz to Mars
