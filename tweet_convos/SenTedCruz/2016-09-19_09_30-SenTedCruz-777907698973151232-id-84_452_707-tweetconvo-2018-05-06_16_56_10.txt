@realDonaldTrump is right.  We need to immediately halt Islamic immigration into America.  Protecting Americans comes first.
.@SenTedCruz your words - EVEN WHEN BACKED BY YOUR SIGNATURE on your pledge to support the nominee, mean absolutely nothing. @Babalugah
Oh bother......
.@Babalugah @SenTedCruz not much anyone can say. He made sure we knew he can't even fake being a man of his word.
We have a woman running who at least belongs in prison - that is how corrupt this entire farce is.
<  he's with her.
such a great article!
I will call it that when you will call Radical terrorist Christians
Amen
The Liberals are not wearing blinders, they r BLIND. We need to replace everyone who will not defend us #Skittles
How in the world did we let this guy get away (Cruz)
it's also time for you to take off the blinders and endorse @realDonaldTrump
and Alt-Right Christian extremism.
keep speading the hate,  that'll get you the votes
And save the Internet, this is what Obama wants so ill be harder to use the Internet to speak with voters during elections...
you suck Cruz
: Issues Factual Statement about Islamic Terrorism on our soil. #KnowYourEnemy is Crucial! ”
we as Americans won't forget what you are doing to swing this election towards Hillary Clinton you are pathetic
Just think of all the things you and Trump could do together - https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump 
We're behind you on this, @SenTedCruz!
you're still relevant...?
... and??? This is what ya get folks from someone whose only paychecks have been government paychecks. #BlahBlah #WheresTheBill
#wheresthetruth #WheresTheBill #TheResistance
another enemy is the Senate 4 supporting Obama's funding
.@SenTedCruz Actions speak louder than words. Teamed up and funded by neocons and globalists, voted for #TPA. #NeverCruz @Babalugah
 
#MAGA
.@SenTedCruz #CruzBS Reality Check: US not taking back returning ISIS fighters
http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/trump-us-isis-fighters/index.html …

True. But it is also past time for all GOP leaders to get behind Trump.
@RestoreHistory radical islamic terrorism, seems a bit redundant.
@RestoreHistory Wish you and Mr Trump could join in fight against radical Islamic terrorism. For our children and grandchildren.
How's everything going in the  Clinton camp?
and keep your word. #supporttheninee
religion is a world problem. Abolish all sky fairies!
Amen Senator, Amen!
Time to endorse Mr. Trump! Politicians need to put disagreements aside and place the safety of Americans first! Very frustrating
Too late, you're dead to me and millions of others.
Phony words from a man who is indirectly supporting Hillary..
you all should be ashamed of yourselves y'all professional politicians and you got beat Buy hey you got fired guy
This is the only thing Ted Cruz has ever said that I agree with! Well said. #terrorism
Teddy keep your word, it would be powerful at this time, be a catalyst in beating Hillary Hopefully you can man up on this issue
Thank you for having a conscience and standing on principle; by these things, you retain my support. Your constituent in #Texas
Buhari refuses to watch shooting of unarmed pro Biafra protesters https://youtu.be/5dUB0b45fBM  via @YouTube
@PrdBlckRpblican you are correct Sir! I see whiny Trumpkins who said they don't need you or your supporters are trolling.
just say the magic words so it will go away
err. You are a terrorist. we've caught you. Do you mind if we call you radical Islamic terrorist so you know we are enemies
it's time to take off YOUR blinders and support @realDonaldTrump !!!!!
Thank you Senator Cruz.  So far it is only you and Trump using any decent judgement on this issue!
I AGREE
Not helpful. Go back and think harder. Try again when you're ready to sit at the grownup table.
Why you can't maintain your integrity& admit "Although I dont agree with everything, I must endorse Trump b/c Hillary cant win"?
people  PLEASE!!!!  If u DO NOT WANT TO HEAR WHAT MY SENATOR SAYS DO NOT FOLLOW HIM!!!   Thank you
how can you even have a voice when you won't support the man you were supposed to support and  helping to stopping Hillary
Endorse Trump or you're part of the problem and not the solution #LyinTed 
Like Donald Trump go ahead say his name. #NeverRubioCruzRyan
and be very careful who comes here
Look at EU its a disaster
I agree.  Please get with Trump and settle differences and please support him for President.  For the Country.
Its past time you take the blinders off and call @realDonaldTrump what he is: The only hope we have to save America!
Senator Cruz I personally know about 20 of your former supporters. All of them are disappointed that you do not keep your word.
Obama should be tried for treason for letting these terrorists come into this country!
Americans will listen to what you have to say after you support @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst @1Bunny4T
Why is it the people are able to call it what it is but Obama & sickly Hillary choke on the words Islamic terrorism?
Theyre worried about offending instead of keeping America safe 
#Americanophobia
If the Dems and Libs want to know why people are voting for Trump, they refuse to connect the dots on Radical Muslims
Calling them a specific name accomplishes what?  They are what they are: assholes.  I vote we call them that
honor your pledge
why are you still talking? Your a liar and your word doesn't mean jack to Americans! Endorse Trump you overweening jerk!
#NewYorkValues
it is past time you endorse trump and stop helping Hillary!
Because that will do what?
#Kill_Terroist_Money_Sources whether $$$ Sources a nation or an individual
The first thing that needs to change is Obama making ICE release Illegals & get rid of College Visas. They come & never leave.
Well said. Now which of the 2 viable candidates for POTUS is more likely to follow through on this? Go ahead, you can say it. :)
@tedcruz "Radical Islamic terrorism". As opposed to moderate Islamic terrorism?
yes.its also past time to vote for Trump.  Supreme Court?
and here we thought it was past time for you to honor your pledge and endorse @realDonaldTrump...Hillary on you if she wins
.@SenTedCruz you couldn't care less about New York City, please go away nobody cares about your opinion here. #NewYorkValues
time for you to endorse trump and honor your pledge
