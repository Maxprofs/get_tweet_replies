@JenKuznicki @POTUS @oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Like the Iran deal...
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Looks like it's a successful Obama policy after all. Support of the communists, O's legacy

Maybe a few years from now, you will reflect how you could have redeemed yourself & you blew it. #RememberYouStartedIt
A man is only as good as his word, and you broke yours to America, Ted!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald and you fail us Ted, what did you do!! OMG You embarrassed the Latino community!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Cuba not America's problem #AmericaFirst 
Krauthammer: Cruz's Speech "Was the Longest Suicide Note in US Political History"
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald The Cuban people don't suffer. White Cubans just don't make money off black ones like in Texas
Ted Cruz a bad Christian. Unable to forgive. Vengeful. Would allow country to burn to stroke his  ego.
When it comes es to  the truth you are like Hillary a very bad liar, What you did was totally sorry. Get over it stupid
You really are lyin Ted. You don't take oaths or promises.  I think Trump had it right You are a sore loser
I bet that your political aspirations are over By the way Heidi is ugle. That is a poor excuse for your speech.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald coward! Broke your pledge!
remember when giving your word meant something?? It's been so long Senator.
Go home and Make Cuba Great Again. You're a Cuban, si?
Ted Cruz a man only has one thing if Life and that is your word and  last night you made it that you LAIR!!!
Lyin-Ted - donors are done with you.
U HAD ALOT OF $$$ TIED UP IN CUBA! U AND UR BEST FRIENDS OBAMA AND KILLARY
Vote your conscience? Are you setting up for 2020? If Hillary wins YOU WILL NOT HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO WIN IN 2020 MR CRUZ!
@  you didnt keep your word about backing GOP nominee. You're  not a man of your word its not your fault its your parents fault
#HillaryClinton #mikepence #trump #nevertrump #cnn #foxnews #usa #TrumpTrain
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald I voted for you in the Florida primary.  After watching you last night, that won't happen agai
If u listened when they interviewed him today.He said "not yet". He's waiting 2 see what Trump does. 3.5mos left
this is your sucker papa fault - he fled w $100 in his pants when he shld die defending ppl Freedom. #GiveMeFreedomOrGiveMeDeath
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald you failed the American citizenry by no honoring your pledge to support the nominee.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Cuba failed and so have you...

@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Nothing new here
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald I will vote for #SatanForTexasSenator before I vote for #lyinTed again.  #CubanMistressCrisis
#Republican Party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa4G9DRHh7g â€¦
Anyone who thought the Cuban people would greatly benefit from this is an idiot.
Great job @SenTedCruz you were true to your character & the reason people hate you: egotistical, self-promoting, hypocritical & fake!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
AND THAT U LAID YOURSELF DOWN TO BLEED A WHILE AND ROSE TO FIGHT AGAIN. MY HATS OFF TO YOU TONITE TED. THANK YOU &RESPECT
AND WHEN THE DUST SETTLES AND THE HISTORY BOOKS ARE WRITTEN IT WILL SHOW YOU STOOD YOUR GROUND BLOODIED BUT UNBOWED
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU 4 BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE OF CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY AND PUTTING THE NATION FIRST OVER DT
THAT MAN IS NOT FIT FOR OFFICE LET ALONE REPRESENTING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HONOR BEFORE PARTY UNITY AND APPLAUSE THANK U
HE NEAR AS MUCH CALLED RUBIO A WETBACK WHEN HE MOCKED HIM SWEATING BY POURING WATER ALL OVER THE PLACE FROM A BOTTLE
HE PUBLICLY STATED YOURSELF AND AMANDA CARPENTER HAD AN AFFAIR ON HEIDI. AND YOUR A RESPECTED REPUBLICAN FOR CHRIST SAKE
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN TRUMP BEHIND THE BARN HAD HE INSULTED MY WIFE...MY FATHER AS HE DID WITH YOU. IT WAS REPUGNANT
THIS YEAR MY SUPPORT WAS UNDECIDED. TILL TRUMP BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE INSULTS AND INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC BEGAN
I WILL RETURN TO SUPPORTING CONSERVATIVE ISSUES AND LIBERAL CAUSES AT SOME POINT AS i VOTE THE PERSON NOT THE PARTY
A THIN SKINNED CHAMELEON WHO RENTED THE REPUB TICKET SO HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS 2 SATISFY HIS UBER EGO WOULD BE REIMBURSED
IT NEEDED TO BE SAID. WE HAVE A BIGOT...AN INSULTING RACIST DIVISIVE JACKAZZ IN TRUMP WHO INSULTS REPUBS AND DEMOCRATS
YOU DID THE REAL HONORABLE CONSERVATIVES OUT THERE PROUD. AND I FOR ONE AM PROUD U SAID WHAT U SAID TONITE ON LIVE TV
There's a surprise between the Shift and Tab keys, called Caps Lock. Cruz = Loser. Go back to Cuba cultist
TED...KUDOS FOR TAKING A STAND TONITE AT THE GOP CONVENTION. THAT TOOK COURAGE AND BALLS. MY HAT OFF TO U
and you are a failure.
if you must contend,  hate the man,  not the principle.  Protecting sovereignty is not oppressing the weak.
You are dead to me. Very disappointed. You lost big. You came off as a small person. Not good.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald truth
rides on an actor's name where @POTUS won for knowing the cards BEFORE they were thrown at him.
McCAIN?  RLY?
F1-17 jerks!
FYVM
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald @realDonaldTrump senator Cruz you are a coward and you will be remembered!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald you will never be president after not endorsing Trump! You are a liar!
again you talk about other country's citizens - when are you going to make America & Americans 1st
STAY HIME TED, WE ARE FINISHED WITH YOU
So that is why I turned away from you Senator. Typical politician. Turn on you own party. Good luck in your next election.
thank you for sticking to your principles. Never endorse Trump!
Cruz says " But I Still Believe in Bans, Deportation, and No path 2 citizenship"
doesn't your Dad still work for Castro maybe he can get castro to share
You failed tonight you did not say you endorse Trump you just committed suicide now go find a job you are out
Please do not continue the destructive behavior, of pitting Republican against Republican, you will lose all respect
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald you broke your pledge & American's can't trust you!
Trader Cruz!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald # very disappointed in you some pride but no light I voted for you but now I question that?
# yep Boo very sad your pride got in the way what would Jesus do, no light
career is over!
You, Ryan, Kasach and any other stamping their feet showing your not happy will get Hillary elected, I am a big fan of u
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald you should have endorsed Trump!  You just screwed up, big time!!
You had your moment, blew it. You might as well be Jeb.
The Dems will use this to embarrass the GOP and rightfully so, what right do have to disregard the will of the people
you blew it Ted.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald #traitor #classless #career OVER #not religious #hypocrite
Very poor decision, a slap in the face of the Rep voters, for all the undecideds you push them toward Hillary
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Ted you proved you have no class and you have less class than Kasich!
you have failed the American people by not saying the words I will back trump ur a disappointment n ur word means nothing
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald sore loser.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald wow not endorsing is going to go well for you
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald 

I think you need to be treated for mental u
Illness
@SenTedCruz @POTUS
your a cunt and a bitch
As anyone with a brain would have expected.
sheeple paste the same crap frm AOL dialup
McCain = Y Chicagoland 8U
if you don't support Trump, you lied on the document you signed.  Liars aren't Christians and you tout you are a Christian.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald So, is Ted a man of his word?  We'll see tonight!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald one more epic fail for  Administration. Anything to further break down fabric of our country
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Because our policy worked so swimmingly beforehand.
Cuba?  We have huge Constitutuonal issues of our own. @SenTedCruz @POTUS @oppenheimera @MiamiHerald
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald mm
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Evidence? Time to end Cuban Preference policy.
Looking forward to watching you keep your pledge tonight unlike losers Kasich and Jeb Bush!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Senator Cruz honor your pledge or you will never get my support again.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Ah the smell of communism in the morning. Only the Elites prosper.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald the @potus legacy has been one #clusterblunder after another
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald you just really come up with the dumbest crap.
@MiamiHerald He went down there and did a speech and everything was supposed to ok all of a sudden? You are a moron
Hoping your speech at convention will stay true to conservative ideals, not endorse Trump
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald this was never about helping cuba just Obama looking good while we all still suffer!
You don't say.
yes sir.Obama needs impeached and congress has proof.Castro needs hung and all his hintch men.sufering needs to stop
Please endorse Trump because:
1-you signed the pledge, 2-Supreme Court, 3-you want my support when you run again #SupremeCourt
Please endorse @realDonaldTrump so Hillary doesn't mess it up even more. This wasn't your time. God has a plan. Please help. TY
that's great advice hope he does that
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald that's Obama for ya gives our money away
Give it time!
Why any Hispanic would vote for a corrupt SECSTATE is beyond sanity.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald fail for humanity,win for Obama's socialist thug friends
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald you need to support Trump stop this division of our party
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Human Rights here in the US of A are likewise much worse off due to NRA & GOP
Please take time from your I-told-you-so party and tell us what you think we should do now @SenTedCruz? @POTUS
I respect you greatly, and think you will be POTUS one day. Tonight please put country first and endorse. Thnk about the SPC
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald It doesn't matter if he endorses. Only matters that he keep fighting for the Country and her people
because progressivism is a step away from communism, why obama helps the castros, they want this for our country
only worse if Hillary is elected.
What was POTUS thinking?  Cuba didn't become Oz after a year?  Oh why did we bother?   Ted:  China.  China, Ted.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald 
And they are still holding on to a fugitive that was a founder of BLM and a cop killer
For the sake of SCOTUS pls. endorse DT. U r a man of great honor & to break your solemn oath increases HRC chance 2 win.
bin obama's plan is going swimmingly
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald Americans have filled #corruptedpoliticians pockets for years & we continue to suffer #soldout
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald       Ted.  Nothing less than full support.   For Trump.  Thank you
So Cubans are savaged by their government, at least U.S. liberals can visit those great Cuban beaches now.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald u mean Obama's "diplomacy"  made things worse? <shocked face>
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald 
That's why #Socailismsucks.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald another failed policy.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald was there any doubt that it would fail
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald imagine that, another Obama failure! Never Hillbama!! Go Trump!!!!!
your bias & hve an agenda so can't speak on this,if u hve any integrity. Same way lawyer boy a biased witness,won't fly.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald OBAMA WAS OVER THERE KISSING THEIR FUCKING ASSES.IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
@lindanye6615 @SenTedCruz @POTUS @oppenheimera @MiamiHerald
Hope u will endorse Donald Trump tonight. Liberal Supreme Court Judges for generations 2 follow means America will not recover.
u do know hillary cant single handily appoint supreme court judge its a process. So cruz doesnt need 2 endorse trump
Let's make this simple 4 u. If you think 8 years of Hillary will appoint conservative judges then your opinion does not count
trump is in no way conservative. Plus there is no way in hell he will win election so theres ur lose lose scenario
who didn't see that coming!
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald cruz is as Cuban as a fake Cohiba.
@oppenheimera @MiamiHerald We all knew the Castros were not going to start handing out lollipops! POTUS never learns
