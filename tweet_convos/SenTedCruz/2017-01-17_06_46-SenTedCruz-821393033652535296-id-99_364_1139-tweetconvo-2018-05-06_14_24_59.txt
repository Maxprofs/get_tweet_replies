Oh yeah? About Ted Cruz's dad killing JFK or about how much hotter Trump's wife is?
you libs sure are classy.
Now that's a hilarious stone to throw.
So you defend your lack of class by pointing out someone else's?
No I point out your rabid partisan hypocrisy.  Plus my comment was no less classy than yours.
What hypocrisy? You troll Cruz tweet & make disparaging comment for no reason but your own partisan.
Unless you find it classy to suckup to a man who disparaged your wife and father?
He did what was right for the country to defeat a corrupt hardcore marxist.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW Cruz does what's good for Texas, unlike these ugly foul mouth minions who embarress our state.
I love when people insult others by doing exactly what they cry about. Also, your spelling embarrasses our state (really!)
I also don't care about spelling, point made,  spell check changes my spelling when I post. Don't be so nit picky
spell check changed your spelling to an incorrect version? Okay.
@Lilkimis1Legend @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW Ted Cruz would be good for SCOTUS!
Hey Teddy, considering @realDonaldTrump is a pathological liar that does not make us feel good.
Would it make you feel better if someone was Senator who doesnt care?
Maybe.
Oh shove it troll. There's no maybe about it.
@jstines3 @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW Tx needs stopped Child Protective Services dragging TX down being 1 doing most wrongful removal
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW #BullShit
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW         To be determined. There are many with a wait and see attitude.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW 'constant contact' sounds like bullshit, Lyin' Ted. Doubt that trump cares what you think.
I think this is an #alternativefact
.@JulieFineNBC5  @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW  How so? "...will be good for Texas" Any actual plans to go with that canned ham? @AngryVetPod
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW
could you ask @tedcruz @SenTedCruz his views on ACA and #WomensHealth, given he refuses to meet with his constituents?
The Man.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW Trump is not good for Texas, the country or the world. Hear the call of your constituents
Ted is a little freak guy who is unable to benefit with Donald.Correct ?
Ted is still the voice of reason and speaker FOR the Constitution in the Senate!
nothing Ted Cruz does is good for the people of texas, unless you are rich.
Just need to stick to the playbook that's already been written.
Then he should ask if Trump will end the MANDATE to buy health insurance. So far, no promises.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW #illegitimatepresident #hypocrite #familyvalues
Cruz doesn't mind that Trump said terrible things about his wife and father? Where's his integrity? #sad
He put his big boy pants on, you should do the same!
My 36% approval rating is chapping my ass so pants hurt. #Suckers #Trumpkins #Sad
The polls were correct. Hillary got way more votes as they predicted, just not in all the right states
Bought into Trumps lies did you!  Hillary Clinton received 2.8 MILLION  more votes than Minority Trump
When Ted wants to make love to his "ugly" wife, does he ask @realDonaldTrump to borrow his balls for the night?
Boy you libs are so classy.
I don't endorse the guy who calls my wife ugly and says my dad helped murder JFK.

not for those losing their healthcare, LGBT, minority or not a O&G mogul. What a complete crock. Sellouts
hmmmmm 
@jamesbott007 @SenTedCruz Repub have such an opportunity w/new admin. Please take advantage of this&get things accomplished.
Please speak up about Devos! Federal funding of special education up to states? I'm terrified for my son!
Vouchers to help the rich pay for private or religious school? I'm in the twilight zone.
Cruz will always be driven by principle, seeking to do what is _right_!
Good for Texas and Sen. Cruz is good for America.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW How can you support a man who attacked your family?  Why the change of heart?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW Ted, Cheeto insulted your wife, made up lies about your marriage and you refused to endorse him.
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW Remember when you said you'd never support him Ted. We sure do!
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW  Great! What a dynamic duo! Love it!

Hey,I am in TX along with many other liberals.@tedcruz, @JohnCornyn will not support you!!
@tedcruz  Ted Cruz and the republicans are what's wrong with Texas bunch of bigots!
Your brain is addled. Constitutional Conservatives believe in equality for all people.
.@JulieFineNBC5 @SenTedCruz which Texas will this be good for, exactly? The more than 3 million African American Texans?
.@SenTedCruz or maybe you meant the almost 11 million Hispanic Texans?
.@SenTedCruz will it be good for the more than 1 million Texans who have been able to get health insurance thanks to the ACA?
.@SenTedCruz the ACA that you voted to hamstring via a budget measure, by the way
.@SenTedCruz unless you meant the more than 1 million businesses in Texas owned by minorities? I'm sure the new admin will be great for them
.@SenTedCruz could you have meant the more than 4 million immigrants who call Texas home?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW In my opinion, the Star of confirmation hearings so far has been Senator Cruz.
what a cuck
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW good if you mean thousands of Texans without Healthcare.
How about the millions who lost their insurance bcuz of Obamacare?
@tedcruz by constant contact do you mean they read each other's tweets or is it an actual verbal exchange?
@tedcruz @SenTedCruz @NBCDFW keep thinking about that. Will not going happened.
How, exactly?
