@SenTedCruz @DailySignal good maybe you can help Ben Carson with that when trump is in office.
@SenTedCruz yeah dude, I hear you. Can I see your feet?
@SenTedCruz This is your most important issue to the people. Because of O-care premiums way up deductible $6000/person #RepealObamacare
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Healthcare Is a matter of National Security. Need healthy educated people to make Nation strong
@Oasis00000 I don't think Cruz has any businesses in China, Dubai, Mexico, Germany... But I know someone that does :) LOL @SenTedCruz
@Oasis00000 Wow insulting right out of the gate nice. I started my first business at 25, at 30 I had 3 and all in the US. :) @SenTedCruz
@Oasis00000 Now you know how those of us that read feel. I would never back someone that cheats people to get free money. @SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz What will you replace it with debtors prisons for the ill and uninsured? ACA has saved lives and you offer NOTHING but misery!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Blast this action all over the place.  Trump not going to do it.

@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Don't you have Obamacare, Ted?
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal how much of taxpayers dollars have you already wasted??WHAT HAVE YOU DONE SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN DC?
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal I bet you will never rest in peace. Hell has a special place for you.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Then what will you do for insurance?
@DrSueDVM How Government Solve the Last Health Care Crisis
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal don't think the US people who rely on the health care will let you do it. Sorry
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal please when redoing healthcare keep the part that healthcare companies can not deny Americans needed healthcare
@SenTedCruz @CardPamcard @DailySignal if you had stopped grandstanding for personal gain and worked with Rubio we could have stopped it
@SenTedCruz No, healthcare should go back the way it was, lining CEO's pockets.  They  love you for it.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal The ACA is working for me and my family and friends! We are happy to have it! Why destroy what the Americans need?
@SenTedCruz Appealing the ACA is like taking away from the American people! You are not POTUS material! You are a Cuban Trump!
@SenTedCruz Want the truth? Cruz supporters can't handle the truth!
@SenTedCruz It should be like car insurance You pay not your employer & you get to decide what you want covered & can shop nationwide for it
@SenTedCruz Stealing Delegates Now American People will not allow this
@SenTedCruz no one asks you about your alternatives... you have none...
@SenTedCruz needs to be replace leaving millions without insurance not cool
@SenTedCruz What, about 50 attempts? How's that working for you?
@SenTedCruz Shame on you!!!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Lets not be like Ted's family. Don't let America get cheaTED!
@SenTedCruz none of those were ever true before the ACA, and most certainly won't be by any plan you come up with, which I've never heard.
@SenTedCruz Want the truth? In his own words!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal I'd settle for the repeal of the individual mandate at this point!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal 
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal how do u expect an 18 yr old to afford healthcare they are still in college Obama care is good till 26 ish
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal total lack of ideas on how to accomplish that #LyinTed
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal https://www.facebook.com/LouDobbsTonight/videos/10153533832672951/ …
.@SenTedCruz Yeah, because FUCK THE SICK & POOR!  Just like Jesus would say, eh Ted?
@SenTedCruz  Lier Lier pants on fire
@SenTedCruz perv
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal U Don't know immigration numbers but want to repeal Obamacare. These candidates are laughable U & @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal You should take a long rest and give up running for office. U have no idea how many immigrants live in the US! Smh
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal no doctors in our county will take Obamacare & docs who used 2 take ins now want cash.
@SenTedCruz "Portable" means employers won't be providing heathcare to their workers!  It should be a choice by employees, not a mandate!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Did You rest after shagging your 5 mistresses?
@SenTedCruz  Ted Cruz meet Anthony Wiener!
@SenTedCruz I think you meant to say profitable vs. portable.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal that's @realDonaldTrump line
You can't think for yourself
No originality
Campaign ideas from #TRUMP or MikeDouglas
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal still waiting for tepublicams to offer a viable alternative
@SenTedCruz I'm starting to think #Obamacare is a sex position. #cruzsexscandal
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal  Obamacare has been a tremendous help to millions of people.  Its may fine tuning. Please don't destroy it.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal And you will make it affordable how?
@SenTedCruz You have failed at repeal, So how about you really do work on the plan that makes health care personal, portable and affordable?
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal you've been sleeping since u became a Senitor Now u want us 2believe RepublicanParty will now lying Ted #Trump2016

@SenTedCruz @DailySignal you forgot profitable.
@SenTedCruz stop
@SenTedCruz You have to be a moron to want to repeal one of the greatest accomplishments of the US government.  Oh, wait, you're Ted Cruz.
@SenTedCruz Correction: HC will BECOME affordable when it is made personal and portable.
@SenTedCruz instead you could make it affordable
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal And while your getting rid of Obamacare, what happens to ppl with pre-existing conditions who can't get insurance?
@SenTedCruz And what's ur health care plan, Einstein?
@SenTedCruz What will U replace it with? Nobody wants to go back to corporations denying coverage. Be a Christian! Medicare-For-All citizens
@TotalRecall9 @SenTedCruz I agree, can we call it a Christian nation yet deny the sick medicine or deny the poor food or a place to sleep?
@origimusic @TotalRecall9 @SenTedCruz Keep religion out of government.  We can be moral without mythology.
LOL! @SenTedCruz: "I will not rest.." you sound just like 0bama you foreign-born ineligible fraud, go back to Alberta you dirtbag!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal No, healthcare is a right. Not to mention you shutting down the government, which cost us a fuck load of money.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal U will have plenty of time to rest in December while you watch Democrats celebrate ur defeat !
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal bit u haven't made it affordable & have not given us a better alternative
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal shut up already. It's not only hard to look at you, it's even harder to listen to you.

@SenTedCruz @DailySignal You are not going to take away our healthcare Cruz!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal have a solution before you start changing people's lives... Never mind, you don have a chance anyway.
@SenTedCruz quit deflecting,  your plans against Muslims in America is a violation of their civil rights granted by the CONSTITUTION

@SenTedCruz @DailySignal hope health care providers and pharmaceuticals go along with that remember for them it is about profit
@SenTedCruz You've got to fall asleep sometime...and when you do....

@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Well freaking do something about it instead of just talking about it!
@SenTedCruz hitherewhatuptodatnirmandoftexas
@SenTedCruz You didn't get it done as a Senator what makes you think I believe you can get it done as POTUS? No one likes you TED!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Until it's repealed, small business can't afford to work. Americans can't get real jobs!
@SenTedCruz So what will you implement in it's place?
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal #Cruz can take a vacation & play a recording how many people or uniting around him over & over
@SenTedCruz You just don't know when to give up. #RepublicansAreMorons
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal you had your chance and already failed your with the Washington cartel
@SenTedCruz is the biggest threat to democracy and freedom this country has seen. Shame on the GOP.
@SenTedCruz saW Heidi on tv today OMG WHAT A BIMBO
@SenTedCruz wow Ted you're so proud of the big losers who have endorsed you. Will you follow in their footsteps as failure
@SenTedCruz And don't replace!  Government shouldn't be involved in an individual's healthcare!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal  That's the most compelling reason for me to vote for you.  Don't dusappoint!
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal when are you unsealing records?  Said "soon" over a month ago
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal You can't do shit..because you won't win ..you're Canadian

@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Yeah, you've got nothin'.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Your hate of Pres Obama has kept u from helping the people.U are like a wind up doll that says Obama Care ObamaCare
As a Canadian @SenTedCruz , you should know the value of healthcare. And also rest. #numbnuts
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal Yes I do believe you will repeal it and many deaths and years later you might put together an affordable plan.
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal on healthcare. Oh, I meant that pre existing conditions are included in that.
@SenTedCruz You're gonna need quite a bit of coffee,.
@SenTedCruz Obamacare covers STDs. Did you catch any from those hookers?
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal here's my take on healthcare. Got to have it, don't care where you have it and no pre existing conditions. My take
@SenTedCruz OK.  Vote @BernieSanders 
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal you've had 4 years to lead and you've failed.  Time to step aside and let @realDonaldTrump lead, he gets shit done!
@SenTedCruz ...CRUZ/FIORINA 2016!
@SenTedCruz Amen Mr Cruz
@SenTedCruz @DailySignal CRUZ BEFORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YOU WERE PART OF CORRUPTION,NOW YOU ARE HABITUAL FACT CHANGER TO DECEIVE/PAY-OFFS
