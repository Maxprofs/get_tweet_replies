@SenTedCruz @POTUS lost again. Maybe add more stickers and it will stick next time
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @POTUS Go F-k yourself you FRAUD, Your not Eligible to even Run for President. Lawsuits stacking up.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you mean again?
MT @SenTedCruz: Every word of #Obamacare s/b repealed. Proud of House GOP for listening to the Am people & voting to override @POTUS veto.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you say that now, but you didn't say that back in June, what happened to change your mind ?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Yeah - it's terrible these poor people getting healthcare, ain't it ?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS NO, THE CIVIL WAR SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED; LINCOLN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT; REPEAL REPUBLICAN PARTY
@SenTedCruz @POTUS and how will you handle the 17 million people signed up for Obama Care?
@SenTedCruz clearly you're not listening well. The American People want affordable healthcare
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Every word?  I think American's with pre-existing conditions will beg to differ.  Enjoy @GoldmanSachs health care, Ted.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  all talk and will never become President.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS American people want ACA and stickers. We don't want u. #CanadaCare #camefromcountrywithnationalhealthcare
@SenTedCruz @POTUS which American people?The Republicans listening to? Listening to themselves?They do count as The people. Exaggerate much?
@SenTedCruz so what's your idea to replace it? That's right. You don't have any ideas.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS screw you Ted!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You are full of crap! Why do you hate US citizens who have pre existing conditions who couldn't get insured until ACA!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS stop trying to repeal ACA repeatedly
@SenTedCruz senator, while I@ rooting for you, I would like you to look more presidential in your attire. Stop with the jeans!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS even ur face should be repealed #uglycandidate
@SenTedCruz @POTUS work on a replacement  for O-care and make it work for the people and you'll win in a landslide
@SenTedCruz Repeal and then what? Any idea at all?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz Will Take AWAY monthly Subsidies in States Where Medicaid WAS NOT expanded people Will have no care
@SenTedCruz @POTUS They failed. Are you always going to be one step behind?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz/GOP have NO PLAN 2 Assure that Working/nonworking Americans have Affordable, Quality, outpatient care
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz Says " We Will let people die in ER/HOSPITALS like we Do in Texas, PEOPLE'S LIVES DO NOT MATTER"
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz says " I DESERVE GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE/BENEFITS  BUT OTHER AMERICANS DO NOT"
@SenTedCruz @POTUS ObamaCare is a train wreck with high deductibles and an increase of 20% in premiums.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS you will not be president and if you are you wont do anything but what the lizard people tell you
@SenTedCruz @POTUS We will see if you are really a man of your word if you get elected. Couldnt even call Paul Ryan RINO when asked by CNN!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS yea but do you have the balls to do it
@SenTedCruz @POTUS replace it with what? Green eggs and ham
@SenTedCruz @POTUS AND all the shitty new hidden taxes that just got implemented 1-1-2016
@SenTedCruz @POTUS http://www.alan.com/2016/01/31/cruz-shredded-over-obamacare-lies/# … #cruz #liar
@SenTedCruz @BraveLad @POTUS sick whst you did to ben carson, lost all respect for you

@SenTedCruz @BraveLad  If I had a dollar for every time @Ted Cruz said it, I'd be as wealthy as @realDonaldTrump .. Still no wall in Texas!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS While you are at it repeal your own health care and salary for life.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS #Obamacare MrCruz - what will you replace it with?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS NOW THE SENATE MUST DO THEIR JOB
@SenTedCruz but what about people with pre-existing conditions? I think their coverage is the best thing to come from Obamacare, sadly.
@SenTedCruz @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Repeal the "Affordable Healthcare Act"!
@SenTedCruz @POTUS 

Come up with a better program and then we can talk.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS What about the words "the" and "is"?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS #CreepyCruz #SenPaisleyBathrobe #DominionistLoon
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Yawn. Still waiting for your alternative plan to #Obamacare instead of squandering all of our time and taxpayer dollars.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You're proud of more pointless votes, wasted money, and wasted time? And YOU want to be POTUS? Get outta here.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I couldn't agree more. Lost 8k in supplemental income due to Obamacare
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Cruz wants all of his supporters to learn about Dominionism
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  you're a Dope. And as a Canadian you should be http://ashamed.healthcare  should trump war, guns and wall street
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I assume your replacement will be Universal Healthcare. Anything less would be pure idiocy.
@SenTedCruz #CheatingInIowaCaucus Ted Cruz should lose his delegates and split between Trump Rubio & Carson. #IowaCaucus #caucus #Cheating
@SenTedCruz @POTUS The American people want single payer
@SenTedCruz Congratulations on your WIN last Night! #IowaCaucus #WakeUpAmerica A man of Integrity & Morals WE  U & @RealBenCarson #NH
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Now lets see who has the backbone in the senate to override it.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS It is evident that GOP elected officials have too much time on their hands and no logic to pursue a lost cause vehemently
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  Have you READ the Affordable Care Act, Ted?!?   READ IT
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Thank you for defending the Constitution,  promoting liberty and not turning the US into the UK - bankrupt. #TrusTED
@SenTedCruz @POTUS   Why haven't you gotten it done Teddy!
@SenTedCruz #RepealObamacare! @POTUS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS over a 800 dollar fine this year thanks to #Obamacare .. What a joke.. And he is for the "working man"....Hack #liberals
@SenTedCruz @POTUS The GOP failed to override the veto? Meaning the GOP failed to get any Dem support. Accomplished nothing, good call.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS ..it didn't happen....
@SenTedCruz @POTUS It's a shame the donkeys in the House were not listening.
@SenTedCruz so will you take healthcare back to how it was pre-Obama?
@nicholasmoore @SenTedCruz actually in his speech he did outline how he would make it better.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS what in the world will you replace it with?
@SenTedCruz sleezy move on carson..reveals tour true character..not good.
@SenTedCruz I see your avatar pic has you standing in front of an American flag. What other flag things are you into
@SenTedCruz @POTUS treat people like you want to be treated
@SenTedCruz they were only republicans, they do not really listen to Americans
@SenTedCruz @POTUS in this country is tired of the games you can trust me on that one it don't take for one man one voice to change everythi
@SenTedCruz @POTUS ...congratulations on your Iowa win last night. Hang in there & give'em hell.

@SenTedCruz just doesn't want equal opportunity or life, liberty, pursuit of happiness for all Americans, @POTUS #veto #74thTimesTheCharm
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Obama care was designed to give some relief to lower middle class, now U want to take that away? your a rat if U do...
@RussellShelbyKa @SenTedCruz @POTUS such bs middle class is forced to face high deductible before getting any help
@thedataleech @SenTedCruz @POTUS blame the Ins companies, they need controls put on them especially if U don't make claims...
@SenTedCruz @POTUS well you better get what you can get because the real commander in chief is coming and I play no games
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Do U feel the confederate history has as much a right 2B expressed as black history n other AMERICAN HISTORY
@SenTedCruz @POTUS getting ins for preexisting conditions was huge for those not healthy. Obama care is not a socialist program like SS
@SenTedCruz @POTUS what people, the 13 million that just picked healthcare, Cruz, kill anyone who is for marriage equality,make u sick,great
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I don't agree, the greedy drug companies need strict cost controls on raising prices constantly, that would help system
@SenTedCruz @POTUS sound and fury, friend...sound and fury
@sentedcruz @potus Great plan.  Take away healthcare for millions in order to bomb babies in the Middle East.  #HasNoHealthcarePlan
@thefirstsmoke @sentedcruz @potus We’re “taxed” by people who use emergency services, but don’t pay for them.  No healthcare = death
@SenTedCruz @POTUS STOP WASTING OUR TIME AND MONEY YOU JACKASS.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS #CruzCrew #CruzControl #CruzToVictory #TrustTed

@Gtophil @SenTedCruz @POTUS The Free Market,  like before.
@ChrissyV_TX @SenTedCruz @POTUS That wasn't affordable or fair
@SenTedCruz @POTUS  That's what @realDonaldTrump said!
@homefreeee @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump and Ted was the only one who fought against it .. I think trump was still a democrat at that point
@Rsho85 @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump What has he done as a Senator?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Ted Cruz is the Republicans Hillary!
@lee_pendleton @SenTedCruz @POTUS zero clue .. Zero
