Trump suggest you buy a book instead
Parts of Texas in ruins. But instead of an appeal for donations @Potus is trying to sell you a book by the NEXT corrupt sadist he'll pardon: 
Instead implies he would not want you to donate, these things aren't mutually exclusive idiot.
Your the same type of person who says trump is incompetent, why would you want him doing stuff? It's the state and local governments job
*you're* is the correct insertion by the way
Fox News is fake news.
Compared to...??


Here's the vote for Sandy aid. 179 of the 180 no votes were Republicans. I count at least 20 Texas Republicans.

You need to learn from Miami regarding evacuations and the preemptive opening of shelters. Been there done that.  Miami also has millions

Thank you all for an incredible calm and organized response. We Texans are appreciative.
LilBoyGeorge #GeorgeStephanopoulos doesn't care.  Watch his interview with #BOSSERT All LilGeorge wanted to do was Bash #POTUS BossertFabJob
He's a tiny little George.
You are right!!!!
Is that why they filled the bill with unrelated pork?
"And to my fellow Senators, don't vote against any aid packages for my state, as I did for Hurricane Sandy"  "I am a douchebag, I know"
Why vote for aid, that is only 1/3 aid? As always,  playing politics at the people's expense. 
Idiots always fall for it.
Did you read the bill?  Don't believe Breitbart. They lie.
Hahaha,  good one
Fox doesnt believe in climate change.Get used to massive hurricanes, and hope for federal support you hypocrites
Do not give to #redcross. Give to local charities.

too bad Fox News has to last ground work for MSM, DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVACUATED?
People in Texas lucky to have President Sen Cruz and Gov Abbot
Are you praying on it, or paying attention now?  #climatechange
Hypocrite & horrid human votes against funds for Hurricane Sandy victims. #HurricaineHarvey
Let's scrutinize the bejesus out of that pork package they're preparing for Texas! Can we count on you, Ted?
Look people, looks like most comments you are making it political as well. I'm born and raised here and have military family. which was sent
I hope some of the compassion shown to the people of Texas will be reciprocated to others less fortunate
Red Cross takes donations and withholds them for other reliefs efforts even when given for specific aid. Do not donate to them.
Praying for the good people of Texas #HurricaneHarvey
Yes, Texas' in rescue mode.
Inform your president that cutting FEMA and EPA budgets makes it difficult to Preserve Lives.
Sorry Teddie... you don't want FEMA $$.
I lived in NJ during Sandy, when you voted against help for us after the storm, and now you ask for it. I hope Texas gets it, because... 1/2
They need more boats there for rescues!
Funny how all of a sudden federal help you gleefully accept so much for Feds stay out "states rights" ... hypocrite
Yes
@CITGO time to #gogreen for #climatechange
Boats via dem tax dollars #houston cannot walk on water
True leadership!!
But #climatechange doesn't exist, right?  All cyclical, right?
When stuff that happens to at-risk areas like Bangladesh finally happens to u
Kinda sucks doesn't it Ted, sort of like during Sandy....which you voted NOT to help.  Nice.
what no book to push?? @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump #TropicalStormHarvey
I checked the % and the Red Cross seems ok so I was wrong
Be good if facts were checked before mouth put in gear but thanks for you correcting yourself
Praying 
It's pretty bad, rooftop rescues in my town of Friendswood.
You ok ?!?
Yea our house and neighborhood doesn't flood, but to try and go anywhere is pretty impassible
I will definitely be praying for you 
Thank you!
Ask Doctors without Borders to help your people. They can no longer afford a http://doctor.Like  in Africa...Or tax the rich?
#stephanopoulos Doesn't care about those hit by #hurricaneharvy his interview with #bossert BoyGeorge Only cares about bashing #POTUS #TRUMP
You ask for Red Cross donations for Texas? But isn't it so that the administration wants to stop giving to charity?
What? You're talking nonsense. Never pass up the opportunity to be quiet. People will think you're smarter
"But our long term focus is destroying all government agencies that could have mitigated loss of life"
Yes. That's the GOP'S way. Tax Cuts for the rich is more important than programs to help the majority.
Yeah right. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154774345347541&id=268914272540 …
like if Ted Cruz is a snake
