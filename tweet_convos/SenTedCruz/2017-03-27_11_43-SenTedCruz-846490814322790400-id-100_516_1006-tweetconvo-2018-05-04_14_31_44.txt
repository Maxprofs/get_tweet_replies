That is wonderful, grest job thank you
does not speak for all, or even most, Texans. His xenophobic policies are harmful and we know it @SpecNewsATX @TheJusticeDept
..His policies are required. Obey the law or jail.Your voice does not speak for m most Texans
Compassionless conservatism is a disease.
those suffering from the disease are the last to know. I send you pity and understand why you embrace being deplorable.
Life is too short to waste any time on you. Bye.
Remember this when you complain about federal overreach.
Ha! How is enforcing existing law overreach?
Use of local police to do the job of the Feds? How is that not overreach?
it's the law and the duty of all law enforcement to uphold...
Immigration is a federal issue and should be enforced by the Feds, not by locals.
It is a true fact sanctuaries are open house for ILLEGAL CRIMINALS. No federal funds for sanctuary cities. Fines for sanctuary cities 
Congrats on your defense of the Constitution and fighting against radical Islamic terrorism. Prosecute those who harbor,aid & abet jihadi
You're not speaking my views, can't wait for you to be voted out!
Abbott is praising Federal overreach, which is ironic since he also says he wants power returned to states.
. It is not just your Gov' it is the other state seats that need help. A Gov' would be out #ed
instead of taking fed $away?I ask you man up and give justice to all lawbreakers espec Austin sheriff!nofreepass
Cut federal funds and arrest officials for criminal act of aiding and abetting criminal and non-criminal illegal aliens. Enforce the law!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Shame.
I'll never understand how dems want our country to be inundated w/ people who r dangerous.
No. You'll never understand why all people aren't racist like you. #christianmyass
Throw the racist card instead of having common sense. Just do nothing while people die.
No, I'm not throwing a "racist" card. I'm calling you a racist.
& when people stoop 2 name calling they've lost the debate. How tolerant of you.
Show your outrage against that too. It shouldn't be an after thought.
But I also understand the the people of this country deserve to be protected.
I'm asking a question: Sex or Sax or Sox?
Great quote
why do you hate us? why do you hate cities?
It is commendable to hold leaders accountable. Especially in red white and blue Texas. Great job gov
I'll fight this racist, economy-hurting, police trust-impeding policy, even if it lands me in jail for harboring so-called "illegal aliens".
It's bull crap to defund the cities and not arrest those opposing the federal laws.
I agree but we here in Texas love  our Governor takes charge in this.. maybe he can lead the others
He needs to arrest those in government that defy the laws of the land. U and I would b arrested
why? I haven't disobeyed the law... have you? Let consequences b black & white & bring order back
If you or I harbor fugitives we are arrested not defunded. Politicians need to be arrested.
true! After time in ministry, we had illegals asking us to hide them in the church... We said, No!
is a sleaze-ball. Donate to offset Abbott's attack on this great Texas city!  https://www.austincf.org/TravisCountyStrongerTogether.aspx …
stay strong and clean up Austin. It shouldn't be a sanctuary city. If so, the law 4 illegals applies to Americans
Applauding Sessions...

Big Nazi circle jerk. 
It is my pleasure to have no choice but to strive and end you.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Mayor Sylvester Turner is best positioned to govern Houston
SUPPORT SANC CITIES AND EXPAND MEDICARE
Thank you Governor Abbott for ensuring that Texas is a place of law and order.
Thank you for your statement

Abbott proved his hypocrisy w\his lawsuit reform. Your pandering makes me think Daddy+JFK has merit.
Where is equal enforcement of the Law?  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324 … They belong in prison
Quit being racist, Ted! I'm sure if you'd write a #TimothyCaughman Law you'd get bipartisan support.
The #LoneStarState respects the laws of our #Union.  #AmericaFirst is a two way street.
State agencies are not an extension of the federal government.
Its time 2 start the real crackdown on these traitors in our Gov that R putting our lives at risk
it's the law!
@DrottM @TheJusticeDept Thank you Governor Abbott.
@Emmita17E @TheJusticeDept 8 yrs of Obama lawlessness, Congress kicking can down rd. Those, once compassionate are just fed up.
The courts will turn this down 2. There is hardly anything Trump will do that the courts will approve
Don't let the facts get in the way of your ideology. Courts can't overturn Fed Law.
-Thank you sir
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Maybe you and Ted can drive the bus while the kids stand on the curb and wave goodbye to their parent
@indivisibletxjc @IndivisibleTeam @DFWIndivisible @AltStateDpt Try being compassionate.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept thank you!  We're not xenophobic because we want tighter borders
Proud of Texas with you as our Governer.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Concerned Americans are with you Governor!!! You are truly American Hero!!
Yes!!!!!  Great job!  Law enforcement actually enforcing the laws......
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept I say arrest those like the mayors sheriffs & the others who disobey the law and obstruct justice
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept is this an exec. order? Can future admin change it?
Nope, simply enforcing the law.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept I'm proud of this move. Being a sanctuary city is against the law and these cities should stop
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept What a concept! Gov official support interests of the citizens who elected them over foreign invaders
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept I have lived my entire life in Texas. You both have made me ashamed to claim it.
You like living amongst criminal illegals who sexually abuse children,rape women,etc
#Texas economy depends on cheap #immigrant #labor. You'll end up shooting Texas in the foot. They're also major #consumers, #homeowners
So you want criminal illegals who rape, murder, etc to remain in your state b/c they're consumers?
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Thank you, Sir.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Amen Standing up for American citizens! 
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Good job in giving the feds more power. Screw, self-government.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Texas should declare itself a sanctuary state from the EPA and refuse to enforce CO2 emissions rules.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept everything is bigger in Texas.  Even patriots.
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept  That's my Governor!!!!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept make Texas great again!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept Many more people murdered by NRA-sponsored gun violence every day!
@SenTedCruz @TheJusticeDept yet a town such as Vidor exist in your state. A racist city is ok but don't protect foreigners. @CNN
Vote Democrat!
Or just light your money on fire!
This is not going to make any difference in the Next governor's race in Texas ,send themALLback they can't VOTE
I agree & as a Texan, I CAN say, MOST of legal Texas DOES agree with @jeffsessions  WE want our state safe..LEGAL
I fundamentally do not support forcing municipalities to act as agents enforcing federal legislation.
Great news !
you are the man!
... they take to help make their State and our Country Safer that's one of the Greatest States I will ever #ADMIRE
....Texas is one of the Greatest States in USA .... and I am always Honored to hear from them and the actions....
oh I agree with ending Sanctuary cities I don't agree with you taking away my job.
Man lied under oath, 0 repercussions. Look at you blind to the corruption in our WH. What a farce. #Trumprussia
Obama's gone...stop lamenting.
Lamenting? More like shining a light on the hypocrisy.
Oh look, small words from a small mind.
thank you Gov Abbott
Will this keep Mayor Rawlings and the Dallas County Commissioners in check now?
probably not but it's a step in the right direction.
Thank you for Protecting Texans. That's 1 reason people want to move here.  Thank you AG Sessions. Glad you Care!
best governor!
Thank You Govenor. I find much relief in hearing this problem is being addressed.
