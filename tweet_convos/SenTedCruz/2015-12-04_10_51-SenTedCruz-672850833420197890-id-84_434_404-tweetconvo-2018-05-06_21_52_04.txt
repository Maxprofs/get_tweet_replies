@SenTedCruz neither is all the corporate welfare YOU support
@SenTedCruz I want to know why you are against it. Doesn't the XM bank cover loans for corporations in high risk areas around the world?
@mizdonna our tax dollars used to pick one domestic company over another and if sales go bad, tax payers pick up the bill. Corporate welfare
@J_Wade_Miller You say used to. What has changed now? Honestly trying to understand
@mizdonna ExIm is gov. bank, takes tax dollars to subsidize exports.  Many companies export, so government hand selects who wins. Unfair.

@GinoKusa @SenTedCruz My point is that you want to treat the two the same, when they're not. I want neither gun violence, nor abortion.
@GinoKusa Then I misunderstood graphic's wording. It states we should treat the gun buyer, who may have no ill intentions, same as (1/2)
@GinoKusa woman who gets abortion, which WILL kill a human being. I would have to research activity in both areas to (dis)agree with you 2/2
Pretty sure @SenTedCruz twitter is run by a disabled cat wearing tinfoil on its head. #FactsOnly
@SenTedCruz I see Ted Cruz as C3PO, except not as masculine.

@sentedcruz @mike_beacham And yet there it was tucked into the highway bill!
@SenTedCruz  The Ex-Im bank seems to only benefit a few corporations.  If it would benefit many, I'd be more for it.
@SenTedCruz So what, exactly, do you plan to do about it? Just more talk?

@SenTedCruz You really need to get the GOP off their butts, no more lies, politics and so forth.  Get Obama out before it's too late.

@SenTedCruz Washington Cartel is just an empty phrase with no meaning.
@SenTedCruz 

Can't believe you voted to let people on the Terrorists Watch List buy guns. Then again, NRA gave you $69,000. #CruzCartel
