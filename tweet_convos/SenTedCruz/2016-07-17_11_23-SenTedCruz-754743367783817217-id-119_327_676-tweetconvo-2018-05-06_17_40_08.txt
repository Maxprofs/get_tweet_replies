@jerrilyn71 @SenTedCruz if the folks killing innocent blacks believed all lives mattered we wouldn't have to say Black Lives Matter
the crime phenomenon is more complex than a couple charts. Let's not forget poverty and poorly educated  and.
then do something other than lip service. We beg you.
the fuck is he supposed to do? A coup?
prepare and pass laws
like he hasn't fucking tried that,, FFS it's trumps buddies both R's and D's that shoot everything down.
I'm sorry but clowns and trumptards  freak me out. Again I ask is Ted the only person in congress?
no but he says he has balls to get things changed
??? What are you smoking?
Thanks for letting us know the obvious Sherlock.   And,  since when are you into journalism.
he's probably been into journalism longer than you derp.
Just like the T that was "in"  the P.  He screwed it all up.  #trumpencelogo
who screwed what all up? Yes the TP logo was a brain scratcher but so are @realDonaldTrump supporters.
On the same page,  or tweet rather.
I think you need to realize Trump won the 1237 delegates and this is a great time in US history as he brings in Democratic Votes
"senseless violence" "heinous acts"... see you really dug deep into your tired bag of politcal jargon for a meaningful comment.
Cruz you will go to hell for what you did at this convention I was for you ,but I saw something different in him and I see I
You are so right! Thank you for saying a kind word for these fallen heroes!
Hey teddy, did you bother to tell your stupid followers that you had DUAL citizenship while running 4 your Senate seat? #Trump
UR A MOLE FOR OBAMA....#EVIL

SHAME ON U
as a republican  please support trump help unite the republicans so that we don't answer to more corrupt from the democrats.

Art.I,Sec.3:"they must have been citizens of the United States for at least the past nine years, and." CAN'T BE DUAL! #Trump
2/2
Senator there is no better time to help unify the party. Please give the speech that can do that at the convention.
well your support for Hillary won't fix that!  I expected more from a Texan!!!!
Sure hope you Actually side with the majority of us who realize Trump can beat Hillary. Sure would be nice to see some unity.
Traitor!!! You have no honor!!! Go back to Canada!..Ur born home country
this behavior at the RNC is NOT Christ-like. By your fruits Ye shall know them. 
Hey teddy, did you bother 2 tell your stupid followers that you aren't eligible 2 be where UR according 2 Article I, Section 3?
Remember when Cruz said it was ok if we lose the senate because he, "Doesn't mind being a free agent"? Oh wait, that was Don.
Your point? #LyingTed @SenTedCruz is a fraud.Ineligible 4 #Senate seat.U can bet voters wouldn't have elected him if they'd known.
made the right choice With Trump you are no Republican you are a Rhino
Ted your embarrassing omg
Ted you're such a poor loser!
As a republican for more than thirty years, I will never vote for you to be President.
I PRAY #PresidentTrump brings #LawAndOrder by removing from Senate seat. HE'S NOT ELIGIBLE! Refer 2 Article I, Section 3.
1/2
Cuban/Canadian has the balls 2 disrupt America's #RNCinCLE &the guy isn't eligible 2 be in #Senate seat. WOW..he is that stupid.
#PresidentTrump did say he would "get to the bottom of a lot of things" .. #Pray teddy is TOP priority. #RNCinCLE
#NeverKasich #CrookedLyingTedCruz #RNCinCLE
@realDonaldTrump blessings Mr President Trump
Hey teddy, is that why you never bothered 2 pursue removing fraud-in-chief because you're BOTH INELIGIBLE 2 be where you are?
RT Article I,Sec. 3 of Constitution: (2) must have been citizens of the United States for at least the past nine years.NOT DUAL!
You are a shameless Snake lying Ted, leave office so some real American can fight for this country not dividing as you do!
#WeThePeopleVoted #Trump

why haven't you ENDORSE Trump .. ?? you said Yes , So did  Mr Rubio @marcorubio @seanhannity
@SMLBound Will you hop on a plane w/ Obama to go there?
#Potus has fueled this divideHow about investigating this #blacklives movement I suspect the motives go further than the message
racial violence
^he isn't wrong terry o. Calm down
They weren't attacked by the giant army bent on destroying America.  They were attacked by some guy with a gun.
.@SenTedCruz Please look carefully how Dallas deals with this issue addressing both trust & safety. Support the Dallas spirit. #DallasStrong
.@SenTedCruz More Cruz bla bla. What r u doing to restore community trust and ensure police go home safe at shift end? - besides bla bla.
no thought and prayers this time? Are you actually going to vote for or write legislation to stop this sort of thing?
I agree with Terry O'. Terrorism. Plain to see.
STOP PC (Political Coercion Elite Politician) TOOL 2FORCE ppl in Slavery It's NOT "SENSELESS" crime - IT'S #OBAMA's HATE 4POLICE
Back Trump to stop HRC
You helped arm the perps with your stand on gun control.  Don't be a hypocrite.
how do you know? @BRPD reported officers called in to ongoing situation. You're making up stuff for political gain. Shameful
senseless violence? Speaking so political .
I don't think senseless is the correct term. Pre-meditated, specific targets, with a desired political outcome. Terrorism.
agree 100%.
so pass gun control or stop bitching.
this we know. What can and what is going to be done about it is what we want to know.
A REALman doesnt hide behind a buildinghuntingdownpolice like a cowardHavesome maturity,act like an adult.Speak2thepolicew/words
because you don't do shot about gun control
When is elected GOP going to have POTUS condemn violence. Back our candidate. #NeverHillary
Obama is to BLM what Osama remains to Jihadis, and too many Americans--white and black--are letting him destroy our communities.
#domesticTerrorism
So sad to see more escalating violence while GOP  lawmakers stand idle bye hating on Trump and leaning towards Hillary.
@OmegaMan58 @SenTedCruz yes  they could be impeaching that POS in the WH right now
go get these bad people and save our cops
smh reading stupid ppls comments!Violence grows!BO siding w/terrorists!There's the problem!We need PrezCruz!#CruzOrLose
@Texas4Cruz 

Don't you mean organized violence incited by President Barack Hussein Obama?
Sadly, again. Will you stand up for bipartisan #CommonSenseGunLegislation when you return?
Thanks to Barack Obama and Dems!
Well no shit Cruz, it's all over Twitter, news channels are focused on it so yeah, you're still irrelevant as well as redundant
Says somebody with an irrelevant anonymous Twitter account.
wish u were trump vp!  I'm glad ur speaking at convention.  I hope u endorse him.  We can't allow Hillary to win!
is already takin advantage of tragedy. His Christian fascism would cause more violence. Ask fascist @realDonaldTrump .
It's Obama's strategy of a 'Manufactured Crisis' working perfectly!
BLACK LIVES MATTERS needs to be listed as a TERRORIST organization, PERIOD... NOW!! #AllLivesMatter
Not senseless, just unjustified & tragic. Murders were coordinated with intent to incite further violence.
We're praying for the police everywhere in America. This republic needs your leadership SenCruz!#WriteInTedCruz
SO why don t the US Senate DO SOMETHING..Like Pass resolution 2 PUT #BlackLivesMatter on the #DomesticTerror & #HateGroups List?
Time to introduce legislation making it a crime to issue a threat against a police officer, threats to POTUS treat them the same
https://twitter.com/alert5/status/741832071367168000 â€¦ why are we loosing our greatest asset? @GaRepublicans
HMLA-773 departing Robins Air Force Base for good http://dlvr.it/LXgR5x  
Maybe we'll get tough with Obama now? The police on air today were blaming him & MN Gov., others in leadership.
Something needs to be done. What about the National Guard walking the streets until our police R safe. Theycan B eyes&ears4 them
#StepDownObama  It starts at the White House
this is ridiculous! Our police shouldn't need protection from HATE groups! Terrorist.
Like all unarmed people of color in America killed by police. What about them Ted?
More like violence incited and driven by DEM oppressors that prefer chaos so they can blame Rs for it...
Cruz..quit your yapping and do something positive to help stop the violence @Foxnews
what ur yappin about?@SenTedCruz is talking&trying while BO is playing golf!Make Cruz Prez &he will change things!@FoxNews
