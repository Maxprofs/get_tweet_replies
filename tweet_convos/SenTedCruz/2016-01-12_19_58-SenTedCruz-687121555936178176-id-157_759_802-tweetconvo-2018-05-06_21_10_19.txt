@SenTedCruz Sent back if not mistaken...the money was theirs to begin with it. Those were seized assets.
@SenTedCruz @Texgalleslie Plus over a BILLION in Interest from 1979!  Who made this cockamamie deal? @BarackObama @TeamMarco @MarcoRubio2016
@Kegan05 @SenTedCruz @BarackObama @TeamMarco @marcorubio2016 The Iran Deal was cooked up by the infamous .@potus and .@JohnKerry #epicfail
@Texgalleslie @SenTedCruz @BarackObama @TeamMarco @marcorubio2016 @POTUS @JohnKerry Yep, that was a rhetorical question 2 irritate Obozo. :)
@Kegan05 @SenTedCruz @BarackObama @TeamMarco @marcorubio2016 @POTUS @JohnKerry Loved it!
@SenTedCruz plastic money
One more time: unfreezing $150bn of embargoed Iranian assets is not the same as "giving Iran $150bn". Stop lying. @SenTedCruz
@fawfulfan @SenTedCruz , Matt .. His dim voters don't know that AND don't care . We all know Toronto Ted is full of crap
He's exaggerating the amount too. Experts have said possible value of the assets ranges from $25bn to $150bn. @TheeCalifornian @SenTedCruz
Most experts think around $100bn. And that's if only you count reduced opportunity costs from increased trade. @TheeCalifornian @SenTedCruz
Either way, Cruz falsely makes it sound like the U.S. just wrote a check and handed it to Leader Khamenei. @TheeCalifornian @SenTedCruz
@fawfulfan @SenTedCruz Ted makes everything sound scary for his base
@SenTedCruz @HallettMatt how about instead of sending it to Iran, Obama give it to every disabled veteran in the U.S.? We're dying daily!
@SenTedCruz $50 billion in frozen assets that are mostly in countries outside the U.S. The misinformation you strive on is mindboggling.
@SenTedCruz Sweetie, it is THEIR MONEY.  You are a fear mongering LIAR.
@SenTedCruz @Ganshohawanee That tweet pretty sums up O's presidency in one sentence! #RestoreAmerica #ChooseCruz #tccot #Ccot #NHprimary
@SenTedCruz actually its the republicans who created and funded al qaeda, the isis progenitor.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz Ted is the man America needs
@SenTedCruz  all you seem to do is have lip service and criticism, when the shoe is on the other foot, then what would you do -- run & hide?
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz the entire Obama admen. chant "death to America"
@PaineFan01 You weren't dreaming. He did actually say that.
@SenTedCruz this $150B should go to reparations to families of ISIS violence.
@SenTedCruz that's hardly all Iranians. Just their lunatic right wing. You know. Like you.
@SenTedCruz Obama has done All He Can to improve foreign opinion of the USA. History will remember the bridges he repaired.
@SenTedCruz unfreezing their own money isn't giving them 150 billion.  Stop pawning your ignorant followers
@SenTedCruz for 5 Israeli soldiers.  Ted, make a sign and chant if it makes you feel better
@SenTedCruz The sanctions that Hillary Clinton designed worked. It crippled their economy. It is Irans money. Israel swapped 1000 prisoners
@SenTedCruz death to America, this say All Persian People, not just Ayatollahs.
@SenTedCruz please stop; history shows that Pres. Reagan is more responsible than Obama and the Bushes combined for the state of mid east.
@SenTedCruz The GOP presidential candidates really embarrassed themselves during the Iran navy incident
@SenTedCruz MY GOD PEOPLE OR?
@SenTedCruz Is that in cashier's check, money order or bank check?
@SenTedCruz HE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED ! WHY CANT HE BE SUED AND TIE IT UP IN COURT UNTIL YOU TAKE OVER?
@SenTedCruz pretty sure Reagan started that trend there, Teddyboy.
@SenTedCruz  then impeach the traitor. .. what are you waiting for?
@SenTedCruz dumbest deal ever
@SenTedCruz And Reagan(your boyfriend)literally gave Saddam weapons that got used against us. So what's your point?
@SenTedCruz Hey Ted, you're not an American, you're Canadian you houser!
@SenTedCruz @MentonGini @BarackObama-@HillaryClinton success: Was it the plan 2 have Russia in Crimea, ISIS in Syria, Iraq, Libya, San Bern?
@SenTedCruz @FreedomChild3 Sen. Cruz. Everyone knows it ain't cheap building a nuclear weapons program. Come on now.
@SenTedCruz congress please stop that
@SenTedCruz Cruz talking about giving Iran US$ 150 billion is just working as a cheap skate and not very constructive you should do better
@SenTedCruz this is what u get when a community agitator (obama) is made president.
@SenTedCruz why did you not vote on rands bill?
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz because Valerie Jarrett said so.
@SenTedCruz Government shut down. Who benefits? Not America.
We're #2...maybe behind Canada?
@SenTedCruz
Is bomb-bomb Iran any better?
I question your allegiance to the US.
You support #KeystoneXL
Who benefits from that? Oh...Canada!
@SenTedCruz zis there any way to stop it?
@SenTedCruz Presidents speech....delusional
@SenTedCruz Sen Cruz Obama doesn't have many "high points" of his presidency too work with! So he has to creat them. Media will help push!
@SenTedCruz it is their money that others were holding at the @potus request, if your side wins they would be paid interest too
@SenTedCruz @etabori Cruz is best hope for president to right our nation and its values. Trump attacking conservatves is bad.
@SenTedCruz people are serious Cruz you're not presidential material and soon will be forgotten, gone from Washington , embarrassment !
@SenTedCruz Tits are fun Ted, wouldn't you agree?

@SenTedCruz U keep lying when you say #Trump doesn't beat Hillary! NEW OANN Poll Trump wins over her and you tie her
@SenTedCruz They will destroy us from within by replacing our Constitution with Shariah law.  Obama is helping them to do that.
@SenTedCruz time for positivity, Sen.
@SenTedCruz MR. CRUZ WHAT ARE THE REPUBLICANS DOING TO JAIL OBAMA FOR THE CORRUPTION COVER-UPS? OH! HIS SPEECH WAS ELOQUENT BUT DISCONNECTED
@SenTedCruz Rafael, you will never be 1/10 as noble and adored as @POTUS
@SenTedCruz  ... And who hold our soldiers hostage. Shame on him.

@SenTedCruz and yet our congressmen do nothing!
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 Obviously has great faith.

@SenTedCruz @creathechaos I wonder how much money Cruz is going to spend on that
@SenTedCruz Stop smuggling midgets under your coat.
@SenTedCruz 
I really hope you or @realDonaldTrump become the GOP nominee. 
Democrats will sweep the elections.
@SenTedCruz He couldn't even say the word EVIL about ISIS. Only a fleeting remark about Reagan's Evil Empire as if Communism is dead. Hello!
@SenTedCruz  No show at Audit the Fed? Not good
@SenTedCruz Don't be an ass. It's their money.
@SenTedCruz @lukejoh01158045 - U would be no different.... everyone is voting #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

@SenTedCruz this tweet is a prime example of why people are so fed up with our political system.
@SenTedCruz Acheivement. That's rich.
@SenTedCruz False. But you Republicans will be happy to sell them guns here in America.
@SenTedCruz I guess you need a spanking for that statement.
@SenTedCruz You didn't notice anything else because you've been too busy campaigning for the position?
@SenTedCruz
We, members of your own party hate you. Ask any of your fellow Senators.  Go back to Canada.
@SenTedCruz @domenic_toronto that doesn't sound good.
