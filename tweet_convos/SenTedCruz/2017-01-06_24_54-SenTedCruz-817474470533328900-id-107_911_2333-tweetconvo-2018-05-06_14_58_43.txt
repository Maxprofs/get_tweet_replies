Yep I could throw a Rock from my house and hit Camp Pendleton and was born there also 1958 . Enlisted Marines loved him Mad Dog
@PolitiBunny he wears t new uniform like a champ. Will someone please document t day before & t day after he takes t reigns
If trump's bozos truly respected Gen. Mattis, they'd consult him on DoD-related decisions.
we've been at war for 16 years, what ethos do you speak of? You couldn't last an 1 hour on a battlefield Mr. Canada
@luvofUSA amen Ted my father was a marine Guadalcanal Mattis will get it right
Funny that the softest man in govt this side of Lindsay Graham wants to talk about warrior ethos.
You really don't have a clue buy still strive for the limelight that gets dimmer by the day.
what the hell do you know about the warrior ethos?
Do you know about @SenTedCruz's work as TX Solicitor General? He's every bit a war hero.
You can't be serious.
I'm deadly serious; invest $4 postage included & get the whole story on how GWB nearly gave away our national >
>sovereignty to the UN & @SenTedCruz fought him & most of the world & won.
Enjoy your hero worship I guess. Yikes.
Oh, I don't worship Cruz at all but I do respect him. You might too if you gave him half a chance but likely you're afraid.
Your entire timeline is dedicated to talking up Cruz. It's odd.
.@SenTedCruz Because Obama went easy on radical Islamic terrorism.
*COUGH*BINLADEN*COUGH*
Gen Mattis is an excellent choice. There're many great generals to choose fm. Some will lead the next American revolution if NB.
what do mean by banishing PC?
Cruz still has a way to go for me to like him again. Can't believe he was at one point my #1 for prez.
not finished sucking up to Trump yet?
Warrior ethos?  What do u know about tht?
Do you know about @SenTedCruz's work as TX Solicitor General? He knows quite a lot about warrior ethos & defending America.
oh sure,  he knows a lot about being a warrior,  ok
Invest $4 postage included in a used copy of @SenTedCruz's book & you'll be surprised what you learn... I certainly was!
.@ArroyoEacid @SenTedCruz
he coulda shown his cojones when trump dissed his wife but instead  he phone banked for him Lol
You slander men & women who serve (as you never have) when you speak of warrior ethos as needing restoration, you odious coward.
You need to get up to speed on @SenTedCruz's work as TX Solicitor General; he very much knows about war & winning them.
This is fatuous and again it insults actual warriors who have been to actual war, about which Ted Cruz knows nothing
A soft oily chickenhawk talking of the need to restore "warrior ethos" while real warriors strap on prosthetic limbs
It's a luridly repugnant spectacle.
Peter: by no means is @SenTedCruz speaking of our fighting forces but of the "social experimentation" politicians have done.
Do you think having a woman on a sub or in a foxhole helps with battle readiness? What about the transgender issue?
I think any woman willing to get into a foxhole has infinitely more warrior ethos than Ted Cruz.
what war have you ever been in? what FIGHT have you ever been in? you didn't even have the stones to stand up to Trump.
why would he ban PCs?
Because PCs can be used to access information which can lead to the ultimate Republican enemy: intelligence.
why did you vote to raise the debt ceiling after years of posturing against doing so?
Just expressing his warrior spirit.
the right man.
@mdsmelser Tell the General now why immigration MUST STOP 4 a prolonged period of time!?! https://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/01/08/isis-shows-preschooler-killing-victim-tied-to-carnival-ball-pit/ â€¦
@bcwilliams92
Bannish PC sounds like a great start!
What a novel concept.
I'm a firm believer that this coming years will be great for America. Please keep fighting for our rights!
@transition2017  #MAGA
what the domestic terrorism Senator?
Can't wait.
But will he allow Christians their Bible say the name of Jesus? Can they perform in religious holidays? Say who the enemy is?
I Support Gen. Mattis! Semper Fi!
thanks trump.
This is a parody account, right?
how did he feel about you cutting funding for embassy security by 50%?
EXACTLY!! Our military culture NEEDS the restoration of a warrior type code!! It's essential to functioning mil.
My husband is a proud United States Marine who is going on his 20th yr in April. Now he wants to stay in because of Gen  Mattis
@transition2017 but Hillary is a war hawk?
God blessing
@Sansone215 this is the first thing you've said that I've agreed with.
@Sansone215 you are a leader. So glad to have u on our side
sign up big boy. Don't forget to wear those Depends.
@MattMackowiak the rest of the tweet should read... "PEOTUS should stay out of his way..."
just revert to caveman Cruz.  Warrior ethos?  For real?
How about focusing on the mess you clowns have allowed for 12 years +. SAD!
watch out for tpp weasel ted.  He loves illegals.
.@MountainRancher @SenTedCruz @transition2017
Liar. Gave toys to invading filth mocked the wall during the primaries. TX is tijuana
The toys were a private charity measure while ICE made arrangements to return children who were dumped here. FACTS.
Cruz campaigned for a wall himself and you can't give me one single quote where he mocked the idea.
get real.  He had years to expose the treason at the border and he gave away bears instead.
You spelled insipid wrong.

@SenTedCruz
MAGA!!!!
By "PC" -- do you mean common decency?
Sen. Cruz it warms my heart to see you back on the team. Now get your ASS in the game and WIN!
It's totally in your ball field.
, How you acted at convention was http://unconscionable.How  you respect & support Pres Trump from now on can regain my respect 4 u.
Vote you conscience is offense to you?

these are remarkably shallow and hysterical criteria on which to assess his qualifications for that role.
you're a joke
no need to fight RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR. You said the magic words, now they will give up and go home.
Restore warrior ethos?Those who served never lost our Warrior Ethos!How about you grow some balls and serve!
Do you know about @SenTedCruz's work as TX Solicitor General? He has severed our nation well as much as any battlefield.
we never lost our warrior ethos despite all his BS.We fought two wars and considers America always great!
I believe the PC in military terms is speaking of "cultural experimentation" in the armed forces >>
>> and most if they're honest do not think it lends itself to making us stronger militarily.

How REFRESHING , we are back America!!!!!!
@transition2017 can we at least expect a temperament correct for public correct since politically correct is out. WWTD???
@transition2017 WWTD = what would Trump do!
-- Why not focus on defeating radical Masonic terrorism, starting with the CFR, TLC, UN & the CIA? Start here at home.
DOD does not currently have a "warrior ethos"? That's highly insulting to the men now in M.E. fighting daesh.
He'll do or say something ignorant & end up killing a lot of US soldiers. But hey, at least you get to tweet like a tough guy.
Hes going to have to sift through a lot of progressive shit thats being floated around as intel...
-- War and debt are the globalist tools being used to disassemble us. The warrior ethos seems good when war's your main export.
@transition2017 Can he also restore the professional appearance of our military personnel?

@LyellBan Hey LYING TED how about we stop arming and funding the JIHADISTS?
<< @SenTedCruz You should have reminded Obama admin about that.
And BUSH,CARTER,BUSH.W
Glad you like him Senator. So do we.
@shawgerald4 @SenTedCruz Is it official yet? Are the electoral votes certified?
digging the boots
