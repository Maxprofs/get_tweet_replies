@SenTedCruz @tedcruz
Sen Cruz,Does Ryan's healthcare bill cover illegal aliens?
Please hold  @tedcruz accountable to his words. Americans deserve this.
DO EVERYTHING TO  AVOID!!  WATCHING!!  CRUZ IS POISON!! - WE DO OUR DEMOCRACY A DISSERVICE TO EVEN LISTEN TO HIM!
TRUMP is PUTIN'S BITCH!
Трамп - сука Путина
TRUMP is a LIAR & a TRAITOR!
Ted Cruz is a KISS ASS!
Under Obamacare, a 64-yr-old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 in 2026.  Under GOP plan, same person would pay $14,600
Ted Cruz has been an excellent Senator for Texas. He stands by the Constitution and for that he makes me proud!
#Lyin'Ted. Can't watch him anymore.
Stay the course Senator Cruz. Repeal period and replace with a free market system!
The only interesting question to as Ted. At dinner with @POTUS, was he offer a SUP COURT SEAT, if he get on board.
Won't miss it! America is broke! Just repeal obamacare -catastrophe insurance for everyone else. Move on 2 tax cuts.
OR Trump could take a few less golf weekends, and his mail order Russian bride could live in WH.
@alycialeah @tedcruz Striking similaritieshttp://forward.com/opinion/335661/meet-the-evangelical-christians-behind-ted-cruz-theyre-super-jewy/ … https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/christian-identity …
Hey Ted - did you use your Government Expense Account to go to Mar-A-Lago?  Goes for Mike Lee & Meadows too!
Face the nation is desperate for ratings
One of the top people hated in this country do not give hm a chance to talk
And you are the expert on who is most hated? Try Obama. @FaceTheNation @tedcruz
Obama Approval Rating 63%
Trumps Approval Rating 41.9%
@SenTedCruz is NOT for AFFORDABLE health care. He's agenda is ALWAYS against BIG GUV'MT period. #BigGuvHater 
Don't be fooled
Why is GOP Reps. so sure Senate rules will not allow one repeal bill?  What are we not being told?
Your constituents will find you Ted, YOU work for them, remember?  They're looking for you.
that got damn Speaker is in bed with Obama and all of these protests got Trump in the I don't give a damn mode
Poor poor lost Ted. The caboose.
Do your job stop trying to normalize Trump you and Ryan are a disgrace and the biggest hypocrites around. Impeach the orange Blob
@SenTedCruz #TooLateTed #No2Ted2018
sorry Sen cruz, can't watch you on that one sided show.
i do not like green eggs and ham sam i am sam i am sam i am
why do you not speak up against the continuous lies from the Donald Trump Administration have a backbone
don't watch fake Clinton broadcast service
Conservative Christians make for the WORST type of politicians. Ted Cruz is 100% the example.
is an excellent debater, wonder how often he gets trapped in front of mirrors trying to convince himself he's right
I hope they ask " What do you tell ranchers getting notices to take their land?"
God no. I only stomach Cruz for about two minutes more than Trump himself!
Attention: The Preceding Has Been Approved By State Sponsored News Agency.
Ask him why he canceled town hall meeting?  Across river a big Dallas fund raiser I doubt missed. Afraid to face those who might disagree?
I'll be watching paint dry.
#ImpeachTrump
is complicit in #Trumprussia and #TrumpcareFail
Who cares? Cruz insulted Texan constituents (remember his "bat crap crazy" comments?) & ignored calls 4 townhalls
Thanks but no thanks!If you didn't stand up for your own family against Trump, your constituents have it even worse.
THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP. I CANT STAND THE SIGHT OF THIS LIAR. I WONT BE TUNING IN FOR A DOSE OF PROPAGANDA
Will he say he is leaving politics? Anything else is useless to see. He is an anti-govt, govt employee.
Wrong. Limited gov, lower taxes, like those who created the country. At least get UR facts straight @FaceTheNation @tedcruz
To a Conservative Christian, its only limited Gov, when it's time to help poor.
..Otherwise, Conservative Christians are legislating their religion onto others.
Plz ask him why I can't get my kidney/cancer tmts @ hosp that is funded by taxpayers? Just because I'm ACA.
There isn't nothing but crap that comes from ur mouth. U allowed Trump to be next to ur girls, when u swore never 2.

That's OK. I'm good.
#RepealAndReplace @POTUS #Budget #confirmgorsuch NOW out if political capital? then pray 4 a well formed conscience
or, alternatively, gauge out your own eyes or vacuum or something.
I'm going to be busy, but if Lyin Ted starts talking about a grassy knoll and his Dad, let me know
I don't watch FAKE NEWS...
Any show with Puppy Dog Teddy will be chock full of lies , whopper stunningly sleazy ones ! Hot dog ~~
m
you have no face Ted, you have to remember the Trump incident first.
The alternate Trump. Crazies all over the GOP these days.
chinless ass kisser
ANOTHER WASTE OF TIME.ASK TED IF HES GOT THE OK FROM TRUMP TO EXPOUND ON TRUMPCARE.
I am sure all of the people will come running…
Why not put @tedcruz & @NancyPelosi on at same time to discuss healthcare & budget. I would tune in for that.
Ted Cruz lives a myth-guided life where he believes in Jesus with no evidence whatsoever but denies climate change.
You just blamed Jesus for climate change.
Jesus is a crazy story about Horus   13.0.   No mistake about that.
Yeah I'm going to pass on this.  Dude's voice is like nails on a chalk board & at the point he endorsed cheetoh -SAD
No thanks
nnnnnnnnn
