THAT'S A DARN GOOD IDEA!!  He has that much.  How can we do it?
Feds are already going after the money & it's $14 billion.
Great idea. I always wonder what rat hole those confiscated assets go down.

Ted Cruz voted against the border wall. He's a  conniving piece of globalist CRAP who wants the spotlight at any cost. #UntrusTED #BusTED
Ted Cruz is only supporting the wall for political purposes! He knows that we the people want the wall!
Don't let the facts get in your way folks.
There is NOT a consistent thing about this fool. Move along CruzCultist. He says one thing and does another.
@SenTedCruz @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump  SINCE THE LIBS AND DEMS ARE AGAINST THE WALL LETS START A GOFUNDME FOR THE WALL!!!
Do you happen to know what percentage GoFundMe takes?  It's not a free service.
Agree build it with all the money that is confiscated during drug arrests. Legislation that states that all money, and assets go to the wall
Local police usually keep local/small confiscations of drug money but feds are going after $14 billion of El Chapo money.
We don't need a fu king wall. It's just a gimmick to promote hatred.
Cruz supported a border wall long before Trump was a factor but without the rhetoric and hatred; just border security combined w/tech, etc.
BAM!!! There it is! Paid for by Mexico, I love it when a plan comes together!
Thats not a plan. Its ridiculous.
Entirely plausible.We already give drug money and other seized items to law enforcement.Police use these to increase security.Same principl
Fabulous!
Might as well have some good from him and his money....!
You rock Ted Cruz! U r a CLASS ACT w phenomenal grace, rising from defeat to support ur opponent! Hope Maxine & the DEMS tuned in tonight!

I really want to know: where was that money going before Cruz had this brainstorm?
Brilliant!!!!!!!
@Haywire1970 @FoxBusiness great idea
Good idea!!
Good idea, too many people suffering because him.
Good way to use the money
Finally a Senator with vision
It ain't gonna happen, pipedreamers
Best thing Ted ever said!
Sounds like a great solution to me.
I say heck yes!!!!
First of all we don't need a wall.   But if the WH idiots continue let the drug lords pay.   But NOT USA TAXPAYERS
the wall is stupid! just deincentivize illegal immigration & tighten visa distribution.
Excellent idea
Now that is a great idea ! Also they should  have pay a. Fee to get anybody's name or names on the wall! Good Ideas
Only @realDonaldTrump @POTUS can have his name on the wall in great big gold letters so we can pay him branding fees
Totally in agreement! We do not need the $$ to go to the Treasury to fund more stupid grants to liberal Universities (for example)
The left will oppose this, too.
Our current RICO laws will take care of his USA holdings. Foreign holdings will be much more difficult to acquire.
I FREAKIN' SAID THIS SINCE DAY ONE FOLKS!!! USE SEIZED DRUG MONEY TO BUILD THE WALL. WHO WOULD OBJECT TO THAT??? FITTING!!!
Works for me!
Great use for seized drug money!
In addition the money that gets sent over to Mexico should be taxed as well. That money should stay in our economy! America first!
Good idea.
Tax all the $ that the illegals send back to Mexico it's over 120 BILLION!!!!
Great plan thank you Ted Cruz
Now this is a plan everyone can get behind. Thank you Mr Cruz
Awesome idea!! 
Do it
El Chapo made the money over the dead body of Americans
Excellent idea Senator Cruz,
What a great deterent for all drug dealers inside & outside of the US. Hit them where it hurts, in the wallet. All that $ would pay Nat.debt

@realDonaldTrump AND MAKE EL CHAPO DRUG LORDS PAY FOR THE WALL ALSO! THEN WHAT ARE THE DEMS AND LIBS GOING TO CRY ABOUT???
I have been saying this for months
Brilliant idea  @tedcruz
@SenTedCruz @FoxBusiness make el chapo and his buddy obama pay for the wall.
I vote YES
Can we get a realistic proposal on its cost and put it in the budget for debate? You know, like normal adults would do?
brilliant idea.
Great idea!
@nooneishere51 @FoxBusiness Now your thinking Ted

What a great idea

Libs are all about taking other people's money and redistributing so I don't know why we wouldn't get bipartisan support on this  #MAGA
Genius! Who wouldn't be down for this idea for funding the wall?! Take the money from the bad hombres 
Smart idea .@tedcruz !
Yeahhhhh!  He has the money. Great idea!
Yes, having drug lords pay is good, but also using Mexico foreign aid.
Isn't Sean Penn POA on El Chapo's bank account?
Love it!!! Such a clever idea!!!
GREAT IDEA, IAM SURE LIBERALS WE FIGHT
@SenTedCruz @FoxBusiness Alternatively, how about paying for opioid addiction programs/services in the US?
Of course and use Sanctuary city money and let American business build prisons along sections of the wall
Is El Chapo Wall a new slogan for Repeal and Replace? Where's the legislative language (plan) to actually do something? All hat no cattle.
The point,this is more complicated than a slogan,and Ted has shown no ability to actually get hard things done. Plays on emotions and fear.
Lastly, 61% of Texans oppose the wall, mostly because we know it wont work and we aren't afraid. We want real, lasting solutions.
Ted Cruz is sto
Good for you Ted Cruz that is how the wall should be paid for.
How did that conversation workout with El Chapo
Well I'm still interested in knowing how that discussion with El Chapo when about paying for the wall
@txlege  Your man is trying to fool voters again,but wont open his mouth on #TrumpRussia #nepotism #townhalls @TXDemWomen @RepBetoORourke
Take his money, but fund healthcare or infrastructure maintenance, not a damn wall we don't need.
Cruz needs to grow a brain.
Great idea Senator Cruz.
So agree and great idea.
@potus @foxandfriends @FoxBusiness @tedcruz  @kevinomccarthy @GrahamBlog @SenJohnMcCain @SenateMajLdr #FUNDTHEWALL
But frankly I'm more concerned about the rabbit dying on the plane n the cargo section. Why put valuable animal in cargo.Small enuf 2 carry
Great idea Ted Cruz!
Okay Ted have you had any luck getting any information on financing the wall from El Chapo in New York
• Right on ! •
Great idea!  I like that!!  How do they get to El Chapo's billions?
Okay well when you have all those guys in jail try to get the money for the Wall. Who's really needs a reality check??? Cruzing along
Thats the best damned Idea ive heard out of Ted's mouth ..like ever!
PROBLEM SOLVED! No debates, no arguments, no problems! COMPLETELY FUNDED W/Chnge 2 spare! Democrat approved
So Mexico will end up paying for the wall after all
Good idea Ted.
What is the catch leave a hole only chapped knows where it's at  mmmmm sounds good as long as border patrol is waiting on the other side
That is a Great idea.  I also propose adding that All $money$ #POTUS #Trump holds back from Sanctuary cities should go to #BuildTheWall
3 best actions to help immigration issue:
1 Decriminalize drugs
2 Enact the Fair Tax plan
3 Reduce red tape in the legal immigration process
Good luck with that you don't have the BALLS to stand up to the DEMOCRATS how are you gonna get anything done before you all lose your JOBS
This actually makes a great deal of common sense. Use drug money to stop drug trafficking across our Southern border. + Mexico pays!
And put up signs along the Wall & border saying "Compliments of El Chapo" #BuildTheWall #MAGA
Brilliant! #BuildTheWall 
Great solution
This totally makes sense.
Now this is a really good idea.  1 vote for yes
