Not all of them are in Harvey's path, but the ones that are could close. "We will not abandon our law enforcement duties.” - @ICEgov

Maybe Ted Cruz will get caught up in 35" rain. He does stink.....

As a Senator
now is the time? You're kiddin right? We've all watched this storm coming for 3 days & NOW is the time to prepare? #Incompetence its best!
In other words, "good luck, and listen to the NHC, because we have no idea what we're doing at the White House!"
Praying for all the folks in the path. Hang in there God is watching & will keep you safe. 

Must have missed POTUS's briefing on this issue. Could you provide me with a link to it? All I can find is Tweets about how great he is.
I live in Houston

To all Texas residents: Please be safe and observe all evacuation instructions. All emergency services are ready to respond. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901057864516734978 …
#harvey should be top of feeds.  This is the most urgent threat to life and should lead every news site. I fear it's being underplayed.
I live in #CorpusChristi and actually does feel that way, not that we want the national spotlight for this, just some more awareness
You need to hang out in Austin for the the weekend
Hang on Texas. Stay safe, stay smart.
