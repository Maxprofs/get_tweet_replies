@bosseone2 @tedcruz Obama didn't go to Mrs. Reagan's or Justice Scalia's - let's see if he can abstain!
difference being...castro was a murderous dictator...obama has admiration for dictators and thugs...
You must be thinking of trump
actually...it could apply to both trump and obama depending on what time it is...
Name some thugs in Obama administration.
holder, lynch, jarrett, emmanuel, power, rice, clinton...
Clinton is probably the only one
so you don't see the total destruction of race relations under the obama admin? their actions are thuggish
Sign this petition telling Pres. Obama to not send anyone to Fidel Castro's funeral!
We hoped we wouldn't see the likes of a #SteveBannon in the Trump cabinet. @POTUS can do as he chooses.
So you think Fidel Castro's death should be mourned by Americans & Cubans?
@ThisWeekABC @ABC @tedcruz @POTUS
How could you even imply that? Castro was a murderer & a true dictator. You disagree?
@ThisWeekABC @ABC @tedcruz
Mike Pence, it's mystifying to me that you can sleep at night.
@ThisWeekABC
Many of the Dems would like to implement Castro's policies in America.
Sign and RT this petition telling Pres. Obama not to send anyone to #FidelCastro funeral!
Aw, gee, Lyin' Ted, appreciate the tip. Looks like Obama listened to your pandering ass! Back to sucking up to Trump.
@GMA @tedcruz oh shut up Ted Cruz... Nothing you say is ever helpful
Well, why would Obama suddenly care what anyone thinks of him. I sure don't care. 53 days.
WHY NOT - YOUR FATHER SHOULD BE THERE - DIDN'T HE WORK FOR BATISTA?
mhh! !
Wait a minuet, are you Canadian or Cuban, 'cus Canadians apparently like Castro.
Dnt count on tht. The democrats philosophy is if I say evil dsnt exist it dsnt unless I am telling you, you are.

@marilouinaz @POTUS #speech A real slap in the face to all tortured and #Exiled. God will have vengeance #FidelCasto 
I bet if we google videos of Bush Sr and Bush Jr and Reagan we'd see at least lower staff at enemy funerals.
But....but...health care and the kids read gooder than before.
Sen. Cruz's right, that should be the spirit!!!
@SpecialKMB1969 @tedcruz Going to Castro's funeral and pardoning Hillary Clinton would be a fitting conclusion to his "legacy."
@Oxco @tedcruz he will be he always supports no count worthless good for nothing murdering terrorist dictators he loves them
@GMA  if they do, it will speak volumes on their intentions for this country-GOOD RIDDANCE
tell it like it is and don't ever stop!
But you know they will.
You don't get to tell the president what he does!!
#@#@yu
Send Rubio, for good
A new tune overnight from Ted Cruz What happened to that integrity? Sad to see the hypocrisy....
well we hope we never see your face any where...ever!
trump said ur dad killed jfk
@GMA @tedcruz well, that's Obama for you! Disappointed in Trudeau though. Poor Canada!
Obama will go be a doormat!
I was hoping to never see you again, sooo we can't always get what we wish for tc
Trump insults wife, family and credilibty hopes Trump will give him job. Jellyfish spine Ted Cruz
Ted Crus Trumps bootlicker.
Fidel gone, now we must pressure Raul for democratic reforms!
@BethReynoldsGSD @tedcruz they'll be taking selfies and giggling in the back row. ban flights from Cuba while they're gone
Forgive, never forget, teach a better way, educate and strive for peace and freedom for all.
I agree with U completely. Thank you.
Can U help get rid of Hillary/gang?Glad to hv U on our team! #MAGA
Spoken like a true Christian, Ted.
Maybe Mr. Trump will go with his friend Putin who praises Castro.
oh goody. Ted is pontificating again.
Fuck Ted Cruz.
why would he? You're being ridiculous again
Ted, I hope you don't attend! You are a true pot stirrer!
@KAFosterSowell @tedcruz send James Taylor or Hanna Montana
Ted Cruz is weird. I never cared for this guy. He is an odd ball. Slightly, two, French fries short from a happy meal. @ThisWeekABC @tedcruz
Untrustworthy
@JEstevezWFTV @tedcruz but if he doesn't go as the US president what does that mean about our country...respect for the loss...
please tell how Cruz could even think he could be pres he wasn't born on U.S.soil when I was naturalized I can't
.@ThisWeekABC @tedcruz Except that BHO owes his political career to Castro via Commie BillAyers, so he's like family
#FidelCastro endorsed BHO & backed communist Bill Ayers who launched BHO's political career.Will BHO attend funeral? http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/19749-obama-s-political-career-began-with-castro-backed-terrorist … 
I'm tired of all the Obama bashing! Wait and see what trump is going to handle these matters.
give them bastards hell sen cruz
I very much wish we wouldn't see Donald Trump go to the White House.
why it shows professional and leadership not to mention it can heal the land gee I didn't go to college 4 that
We don't really care what you hope. What was that lie you told about Cuban heritage & your dad? I'll google it.
but you know they will!
We didnt think you would sell your soul either Look in the mirror before judging someone else
Republicans bash Castro,  consider THIS puppet murderer a hero.
#Servile @SenTedCruz is a #FlipFlop & let down even his family! 
@tedcruz has no #Intention or #Credentials to protect #Cubans!
@ThisWeekABC
Make him ambassador. I want to be able, to travel to Cuba, some time.
the never ending laughingstock that is your life ...
cc:@SenTedCruz @tedcruz
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz you know he will go just to anger Americans.
STOP. get Ted off the screen
His voice hurts my ears
@GMA @tedcruz who cares what Ted Cruz thinks. He's history. Bad history
Comrade #ClownMeat said best. Lying Ted! @tedcruz #GOPG #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain
Right, Reagan would never do anything like that! Oh, he did?
@MarcusJ96111936 business. Quit demanding from other's wat u aren't even doing yourselves.major hypocrisy!
@MarcusJ96111936 judgement on other's get your own house in order.thts your problem now always in other countries
@MarcusJ96111936 lmmfao this country is so hypocritical.the same thing u have done to people.u have the nerve to pass
@SenTedCruz We will pull back on Obama's Cuban fiasco after January 20. Obama sees the funeral as an opportunity to be on stage
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz does he want to do the honors?!?!
yes or no, spineless slug. Do you stand by what you said to trump? Or not! Be a good Christian and tell the truth.
CORRECT; it's a MORAL ISSUE, NOT a 'PC' one where ethics & SPIN carry the day.
@ChuckNellis @tedcruz    Amen Senator Cruz
.@ThisWeekABC .@tedcruz Fidel Castro glory days https://twitter.com/ValeriaPugliesi/status/802740794713079808 … … , not to be mourned or praised.
@EricSteeleLive Obama is a leftist: leftists love murderers and tyrants. 
@Fastcars2016
Thanks, this is the first time I've seen it on my twitter feed.
Headlines across #NYTIMES 
 "Obama HEADS TO CUBA"
"Mourns the Life and Death of Mentor and Friend, FidelCastro!
Fidel Castro is dead, you're still critiquing Obama, as this person @iyad_elbaghdadi makes terrorist threats.
just as Jesus Christ would preach ?
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz 
The only way I'd be happy with it if they sent you and/or @marcorubio to spit on his grave.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Obama should go to Fidel's funeral. Not because we need representation but because he is mourning
Would like to see Cruz in Trump's Cab
.@ThisWeekABC @SenTedCruz @tedcruz How about if going to Fidel's Funeral is in a Spirit of Celebration of the Triumph of Economic Freedom?
@SenTedCruz Yeah use our tax money for a person we don't admire 
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Unfortunately Jill Stein & POTUS Obama classify him as a "revolutionary", not a criminal dictator.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz oh but he will.  Obama hasn't seen a communist or socialist he hasn't liked
:You will. Think Obama wants to run for president there.
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Would you be surprised if he did, I wouldn't. POTUS is a soc/comm so he must pay his respect to another
thrown in prison ... and tortured in Cuba ... 
waterboarding and everything else.

#CloseGitmo
@SenTedCruz @forarticlesonly
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Ted is correct.  Don't honor a brutal communist dictator.
@k9rotts @tedcruz You know Dems will go. The stupidity#of democrats & the MSM is an embarrassment to our nation.
This man so reminds me of the Penguin from Batman in every way
@SpecialKMB1969 @tedcruz dang skippy! No more excuses!
as he di erts away from the questions he was asked about believing Donald Trump is a liar, spineless
Egypt jail and oppress journalist, the Arab States oppress women and LGBTS but America back then and criticize Cuba. Hypocrites
@bosseone2 @tedcruz 
Hear, hear !!!
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
lying Ted strikes again. Just stop!
if he does go than it is really none of your business. Still trying to be relevant.... People are aware.....
you voted for a birther. Shut up
if he goes so what. It's call RESPECT something that you don't know nothing about
.@ThisWeekABC Didn't @tedcruz used to be famous?
You support @realDonaldTrump  and he praises a dictator. So what's the difference.....#Putin
Bet Doh-bama will! From one communist to another!
And you backing Trump after all he's done and threatened to do? What a hypocrite. You have no room to lecture/advise
This comes from a man that HELPED a Nazi win our Elect College!  Stop worrying what POTUS does u hv bigger probs
Fuck him.
Castro was a world leader we might not like how he led his country however we have no right to judge God will now
But it's cool 4 u 2 endorse Con Don after he publicly insulted your wife & father? Where is your loyalty hypocrite?
@ABCPolitics @tedcruz no kidding Ted. But, he sent official to the Michael Brown funeral so.......
Going to a world leader's memorial is respectful, you twit.
https://www.facebook.com/YaakovLehman/posts/10105074091886017 …
I'm absolutely sure he won't be attending @tedcruz funeral...
we must go we have a new embassy now. We are trying to bring some type of relations there after 60 yrs its time

STHU..
.@tedcruz: "I very much hope" we don't see Pres. Obama, US officials going to Fidel Castro's funeral http://abcn.ws/2gjRusY  #ThisWeek 
unfortunately  they'll be there they are liars
THERE R A GROUP OF PEOPLE SAY "OBAMA" IS A MONSTER / & A GROUP THAT SAYS TRUMP IS A MONSTER / GO FIGURE DA USA
does he know Donald Trump had Putin help with his campaign and he loves Putin? And ha dad shot JFK.
is the most divisive career politician in #washingtondc litterally lying to further seperate the country #TermLimits
it's 'Ly'n Ted'
mind your own business ted. It's for possible.for people to go to support the Cuban people,not Castro himself.
Well..., one thing is clear about this Obama, he has No Morals and No Principles, So anything is possible.
that's how dictatorships work Ted.
@ABCPolitics @tedcruz What about Putin?!  Trump praises him like a god. Don't be hypocrite.
Haven't the GOP learned yet. You can't tell POTUS what to do or how to think.
Recount votes for Jill only 33,000 the amount of people at a Green Bay Packer #game we won get over #it #DNC
This man has proven not to have conscious while telling people to vote theirs. Who cares what he says?
by the way where is all this Big boy talk when President Elect speaks so highly of Putin  everyone quiet
why not....? He has the element of humanity.... Not controlled by hate, and politics of grand standing like you..
That would be a slap in the face to all Cuban Americans and family and victims. 
Sorry Teddy, we have diplomatic relations so someone has to go. Is your dad free?
Oh Ted, crawl back in your hole. No one likes you or what you have to say.
Noticed @tedcruz couldn't say @realDonaldTrump a wasn't liar. First honest thing he's said since calling Trump liar. No Mandate
and for that reason and this alone, Obama should head straight over to that funeral!
he always looks constipated! He is full of 
I can assure you Ted will completely change his opinion if any republican attends.
STARTING TO THINK HE DREAM'S TO B  PRES. OBAMA  U KNOW  IF " OBAMA " CAN B PRESIDENT I KNOW I CAN  BUT HE CAN'T
Screw @tedcruz   Black meet kettle
oh shut up where was this talk during Trumps bromance with Putin the murderer and tyrant.....coward
- You aren't relevant anymore Teddy !!
Sen Cruz,  bHUSSEINo thinks America was wrong & will do all he can b4 he leaves to destroy us
Gee, isn't Cruz supporting the "thug" that accused his own father of assassinating JFK! Didn't Trump do bus n Cuba!
And here is Cruz, right on cue. Heads of state will do as they choose
EITHER SPEAKING 4 A NUMBER OF PEOPLE / R HE STILL SUCKING ON PRES. OBAMA CAN'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT /
he always looks constipated! 
@ABCPolitics @tedcruz omg, Tedder Cruz will say anything to get attention, give the man some Ritalin
