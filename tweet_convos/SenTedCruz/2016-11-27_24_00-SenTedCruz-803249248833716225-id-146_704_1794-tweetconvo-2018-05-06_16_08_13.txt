@tedcruz 
Do not elevate murderers position in history ...
I agree completely!
@tedcruz nut job! You don't give POTUS orders! That's your problem. You should spend more time doing your job first!
. Obama is going to the Funeral of Castro but he is a no show at Nancy Reagan and Justice Scalia. There is something wrong with him
@tedcruz Ted Cruz has no business telling anyone what they should or shouldn't do he is a moron
@tedcruz You know that Obama will go. He wants to honor the communist dictator! It's part of his failed legacy he wants to save.
@tedcruz why????
@tedcruz Dear Mr
! I  am very happy  because  the day will. at  Hungary  Parlament. Good bye Andrea
@tedcruz Obama is jealous Fidel Castro. A Successful dictator in Obama's eyes. Obama wishes he could take power like that.
@tedcruz He should listen to someone like you who was affected by his regime!!
. Obama is up to something crooked before he leaves office Michelle is a disgrace to America not doing the photos of next POTUS
@tedcruz Wow! I thought Blaze was done 4. Why R U working with Glenn Beck who is ROMNEY pretending 2 B Christian
@PatVPeters  Are you kidding.......#Obama's going to attend.
Obama likes dictators, maybe he will stay. Mail forwarding possibilities?
I wouldn't be surprised if Obama himself went to Castro's funeral. Obama loves murderous communist dictators. @theblaze
@AbbyKPace Cruz is a phoney ,he is full Washington ,and could care less for his base .or anyone else for that matter jobscared!!
Yes I agree lol just bc I posted that doesn't mean I can even stand the man just agree with his statement.
it wasn't directed towards you  just a.general observation :)
Obama will want his ashes
@SenTedCruz Obama wishes he had Castro's kind of power here. Imagine Castro's power with the US backing it. ISIS on crack.
Maybe Micheal O. should go their on vacation and or sympathy tour.
@SenTedCruz That's right.
@tedcruz The Castro regime hates the us and the liberties we have. They had spread that hate to all their communist allies
@tedcruz sounds angry, maybe you should read the Bible again, I think you missed the message
@tedcruz umm funerals are for the living, and besides, wouldn't it be a good time to try to have a positive influence on Cuba
@tedcruz . Obama us showing his hate & distain for,Americans of ALL BIRTHPLACES by glorifying murderous dictators such as Castro.
What does it matters? He's out January 20.
So very true Ted. But the left are mere extensions of Castro's design. Dem's brainwash, lie,cheat,steal,kill. no diff
@tedcruz Ted Cruz should be sent to Cuba, along with his father to stand trial for treason and abstract stupidity.
ew what an offensive repulsive man Ted Cruz is
@SenTedCruz plz. Like he will listen.Doesn't make one statement re: cops being ambushed, no calls 2 their families, he's an a-hole
.@theblaze @SenTedCruz The Gipper would never do anything like that. Or would he?
. Watch Obama is probably going to Fidel Castro's Funeral. When he didn't show up for Nancy Reagan and Justice Scal
Obama will probably go, himself, even though he shouldn't.
@SenTedCruz dear Lord this just shows the kind of person obama is by mourning this monster
Like you, @SenTedCruz and your father, my father was well acquainted with communism and took any occasion to set record straight.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz if Syrian refugees should stay to fight Assad, why did Cruz's father leave Cuba?
@SenTedCruz Cruz has bigger problems...his waistline!
Ought to get his OWN life in order,before telling others how to lead theirs
@SenTedCruz Can send James Taylor--he can play "You've got a friend"
https://youtu.be/-kATwwRomMs 
I agree with you Ted Cruz
@tedcruz He will, to embarrass us further.
@tedcruz He should go himself!
What do you care Glenn Beck .. you've ditched Cruz
@tedcruz grandpa munster has spoken
@tedcruz     http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/batista.htm …

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista …
@tedcruz    Cruz was a supporter of previous dictator
@tedcruz who cares what #LyingTed has to say!  He is a fraud!!
@chrisenloe Bernie Sanders has always championed Russia & Cuba! He would be right at home attending Castro's funeral!
@tedcruz more "wisdom" from the Canadian born never-gonna-be
@tedcruz you should go yourself Teddy, maybe stay with some family and get caught up!
@tedcruz his entire cabinet will be attending along with Hillary and Bill.
@tedcruz Why not Bernie? He's got some frequent flyer miles coming.
Nice, we embrace China on one side and we hate Cuba on the other side. What China did to Tibet? we do business with them
Obama is so unAmerican he would go just to rub our noses in it. Never misses an opportunity to screw America. #SickOfObama
Yeah, yeah Ted, we hear ya. Fist bump, Now from one Texan to another, just go away.
Anyone who goes should not be allowed to return, have their passport confiscated, & citizenship revoked.
@tedcruz Thankfully Obama has never listen to you Ted that is why America is great today, tomorrow??
@tedcruz @chrisenloe Amen
@tedcruz dear Mr man sputum in light of your remarks can you please clarify your position on Putin
Obama admired his dear socialist comrade, Castro!
I think he will go in person!
@TreeTreeTweeTs only if they bring back terrorist cop killer Joanne Chesimard in handcuffs
@tedcruz dang skippy
@tedcruz it's not his place to tell the President what to do.
@tedcruz to Ted nothing but props! Perfect.
Except...Himself as POTUS..Watch the "House of DEM's" Crumble
@tedcruz so you're the #POTUS and you decide what the other @POTUS gets to do? Wow, I didn't know we had two of them!
@GreerBarnes1
I think we should send Ted Cruz or some dissidents to crash it and expose Castro as the monster he is.
@tedcruz  it would be a disgrace - don't do it - speak up America
NOOOOOOOOOOO QUEDARÍA COMO UNA CHUCHA.
@tedcruz Like Obama cares what this loser thinks? Ted should worry about Texans. He hasn't done squat for them in years. #LyinTed
@tedcruz Id do it just to piss Cruz off,hes a choke artist
BO didn't go to the Paris shooting victims memorial.
@tedcruz - I think the ship has sailed on President Obama listening to anything you might say. Go away Ted. 
@tedcruz Red Cruz is a disgrace Trump walked all over him treated him like a dog and he still kisses his boots like a dog
Why would we show support and approval for an enemy of America?
@tedcruz pack your bags teddy
Too late @CKapernick7 is on his way to mourn a hero ... I hope 'Kiko' made permanent damage today. Saludos!
@tedcruz I am on the #NeverCruz platform. You blew it Ted. Lost all respect,  can't listen to anything you say!
Ted, Obama can do what he wants
@tedcruz still politicizing it. You need a new social media manager....
Well Senator Cruz, at least you're focusing in on the important stuff...
@tedcruz Why don't you go, for old times sake Teddie? Your dad admits to serving Castro before running away to U.S. & Canada.
It will be in contradiction with new relation we are trying to do with people of Cuba if no one show up.
@tedcruz Ted is absolutely correct.
@tedcruz ...that we even have 2 have this debate....BO has certainly changed part of America.....un-American
Well I wouldn't be surprised, he did send two representatives to that thugs funeral in Ferguson.
@tedcruz he did not make #scalia funeral but I bet he goes to #castro. All about @BarackObama and his #legacy
@tedcruz who cares what Cruz thinks

@tedcruz 
What a phony proven useless c ser Cruz is
@tedcruz i full expect Obaa himself to go and bow at the grave in tears.
@tedcruz Of course he shouldn't, if he doesn't go himself, he'll probably send lurch!
"send?". Don't you mean "go?"
@tedcruz Send Hillary.
Yes, and @POTUS should send a delegation lead by #luciferintheflesh.
I agree, but I don't think he will listen
this guy should of been the president. I hate stupid republicans.
Surprised Obama isn't there now, throwing himself on the coffin and wailing.
.@tedcruz 

Worry about
The Constitution 
The Law 

PLEASE

The fact this even needs to be said is appalling. Thank you @SenTedCruz for saying it, though.
Ted Cruz is not the president. According to Trump his dad killed JFK
Obama should go and stay.
he can send his family
the Honorable Senator Cruz from the Great state of Texas#ForeverCruz
He probably won't send anyone; he will go himself.
Obama is going...  guaranteed.....  selfies to follow.
is @JohnKerry still in Antarctica?
.@theblaze
@chrisenloe   OBAMA is an idiot.  He never know his place. Let him go. Maybe they'll lynch him this time. @BarackObama @tedcruz
knows***
