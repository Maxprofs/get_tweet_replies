One day soon, ALL of Tex-ass will be blue
Lib are you a raised and bred Texan?  You are living in the wrong state!  Move to Chicago or Detroit #keeptexasred
I live in NYC, like Drumpf
this is how it should be done !!!
I respect you so much Gov Abbott.  Wonder why all the liberals are leaving CA and moving to the great state of TX? #keepTXred
Whatta crap talker-- most txpds were against open carry. NRA was for it though!  U know, ur pimp. #NRAwhore.
not sure what part of Texas you live. Every Texan I know totally supports open carry. Shooting a gun probably hurts your hands.
- 68% of Texans oppose open carry. You must not know too many Texans. #gunsense
Nice photography. Is that an night-time time exposure?
THANK YOU for recognizing and supporting #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay

Obama lit the white house in rainbow. Go figure!
Awesome lighting job. Would've loved to see it at midnight when its darkest
Something OBAMA Whitehouse refused to do.
Beautiful, and needed.
How a day to remember all of those wrongfully killed by police, or who die while in prison?
It should be lit up in red, the colour of the blood of the countless victims of the drugged-up #coproach gangsters.
@SheriffClarke @KHOU @houstonpolice @EPPOLICE @DallasPD @fortworthpd Great to see this support. LONG OVERDUE #TRUMP
I love the law!!

Thank you, Governor.

@SenTedCruz
The White house was lit with rainbow colors,it was asked that it be lit in blue, NO was the answer. #BlueLivesMatter
why are we wasting electricity on a building that should be empty?
@donnas0818 - Love it
@satin_silkn nice and about Time!
@WEdwarda and what color is the white house tonight?

Sensible people stand with their protectors!
@365ThingsAustin If you really appreciated them and or any Texans you would simply vacate the place....
Why would he ever do that? He's an awesome Governor
ummm no not really, not at all.... not even a little. He is a blemish on us worse than Bush...
Give me specific examples of how exactly Abbot is a bad/poor governor?
1 ok for one his attack on female health care, his attack on the LGTB community, his lack of ethics as exhibited with his
Sure let's hear them all
Looks great. I posted one last yrs taken by a DPS person. Was well liked.. Maybe nxt yr WH will light up in blue...
Thank you Governor Abbot for having Class - #Texas proud. #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay Thank you #BlueLivesMatter
@StopStopHillary thank you Governor Abbott#BackTheBlue
Way to go, Governor! Can't wait for Trump to light the White House blue for Law Enforcement.
thank you governor
and the rest of the year lobby for more guns in public places?  Makes no sense.
Sure it does
@sokeijarhead Beautiful  
Thank You To All Law Enforcement 

#NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay 
Abbot thinks he's going to be President someday. I mean, how is he going to answer ordering TX guard to monitor US military??
Not rainbow?? Still waiting for my Jade Helm 15 update.
@KXAN_News thank you for your support of the law enforcement. Makes me proud to be a Texan.
Thank you Governor for your support of law enforcement.  They risk their lives everyday for us and deserve our respect.
nope still mad at you.
- Texas has the largest prison population in the USA, which has the world's largest prison population. What was Freedom? 'member?
. Don't break the law then prison is not a problem. #freeman
- let me know how that works out for you when not being 1% wealthy becomes illegal, lol. They may come for you last, but ....
You are a PATRIOT
SALUTE. THX
very cool. The police keep us safe and they get spit on. Thanks for leading by example and showing some respect.
Don't like Abbott at all but I support this #backtheblue
I hope when @realDonaldTrump is sworn in, he'll light the White House "Blue" to honor law enforcement. Obama doesn't...
That would be nice?
Thank you from TMPA.   Also, thanks for the video today.
As a bus driver, I'd like to say on behalf of all my fellow law enforcement officers: you're welcome.
That's cute
It's, literally, the least you could do.
