Why not channel your efforts towards saving lives. Florida has ZIKA emergency. FL needs clean funding bill passed.
Ahem: Ted Cruz & Texas GOP delegation DEMAND answers fr Obama on Zika funds
The answer is @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee & GOP won't agree 2 pass clean bill. They're loading the bill w completely different issues.
Cruz tried helping pass a bill to help with Zika. @POTUS said no cause the amount wasn't 1Billion. Obama Pork bills?
The bills include defunding Planned Parenthood. All Dems would authorize $1 billion for ZIKA. #LyingTed clean bill.
Planned Parenthood is a private business. Why does it need funding?
PP is a great organization. You regressives just never stop.
Except when they split the baby's head and suck out the brains. Or use forceps and tear him limb from limb. #murder
what a beautiful world this would be if Ted Cruz were president of the United States
#GOPe #RINO's u are proving to be wot #WeThePeople are tired of!

#ENDORSE #TrumpPence16 #MAGA
Or don't support Trump. U would b a black mark. We all no u want H & her corruption 4 personal reasons. We r not dumb.
Thanks guys! Keep the Faith, hold the fort! No retreat--no surrender!
For those complaining, Zika is NOT a life threatening emergency.
It's time to put your country above your foolish pride & endorse & rally around @realDonaldTrump & beat Hillary.
It's really not news, when #LyingTedCruz desides to do something and his little buddy Mikey says, "ME TOO!"
How about a full accounting of why you 2 copitulated to Obama
Right, you'll get it on the same day he provides his real birth certificate
more waste of time and waste of money
Awesome! Thank you so much for both of your hard work, dedication & persistence.
WELL TED....THIS IS KINDA DUMB...YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL ANYTHING THEY DID IS CLASSIFIED!  REALLY?
@Texastweetybird @SenMikeLee That's fine & dandy,but when are u going to do right thing &support the Rep.nominee to beat Hillary
Who cares? U r all 4 urself. How u take ur behavior &=it 2 The Word?? Ur chosen words when cordially invited 2 speak at RNC.....
Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum are too dense to understand that it was Iran's money since 1979. Just grandstanders.
ANSWER WILL COME ON THE 12th of NEVER

@OANN @NRO @SenShelby @SenatorSessions @TGowdySC @DarrellIssa @RealJamesWoods

Two key issues effectively nearly prove a quid pro quo: The timing and the use of foreign cash.
Wah Wah Wah  Stop it potus before I slap u with my purse!! 
#WAKEUPneverTrumpers

#hilLIARy #SlickWilly back in #Whitehouse will complete destruction of #America
Are GOP neverTrumpers willing to put their ego aside so that Scalia isn't' replaced by a Mrs. Bill Clinton activist? 
Don't you have something better to do? Like govern? #DoYourJob

Jerkwades ask political bullst. R U2 coming back to work it? Surprise, NO.   Ask Iran 4 answrs. Waste Iran time/$$
@WarriorsHart444 @SenMikeLee Just pass a clean ZIKA' no add-ons, work on that later.
@MayIrmamay14 @SenMikeLee Thank you senators for fighting for We The People against a corrupt Administration! Heroes! 
Meanwhile Iran celebrates Hezbollah
good luck with that
O AWAY CLOWN
Thank you for holding Obama's admin feet to the fire and demanding answers. We will see if you get a response Monday
get behind trump or find a new job
Ted, I'm surprised you found another senator that would actually want to work with you.
@DebRuiz319 @SenMikeLee   Lol good luck with that!! Do your damn jobs!!! Impeach the sob
So l Texas But I wouldn't you
glad to see but you claim to hold constitution high but go back on your word to help party against HRC. Shame on you
does it really matter Obama has his own rules and is above the law and you guys can't unite to get America back
Good luck with that.
Zzz
So what!
You know it's never going to happen, so work on something more important
WhatTransparency?
@LindaRoyer1
At least they are doing something.
How many OTHER unknown cash payments, I wonder?
Most transparent administration ever! /sarc
thank you Senators ..
thank you for taking this on!
Obama admin won't tell you. They don't answer to you.
How about an accounting of St. Ron of Reagan and his arms for hostages deal?
do you really believe you'll get a truthful response? Nothing will happen no matter what. Corrupt and unstoppable.
Some of that $400. M could have got me and a "few" others off Food Stamps.
Have ya thought about helping out on Zika?

a nice political move. Perhaps the msm should start pressing a possible clinton admin on this issue.
it's time to step up Ted
do u really think this guy is going to tell the truth about paying a ransom with laundered tax payer money.
Eho gives s sh*t what you want
great job. Hold these crooks accountable. 400 million to Iran is a joke
Obama doesn't care, we keep letting him get away with whatever he wants
Do you really think you'll get it? Or be ignored?
Thank you!
Sen. Cruz, I didn't really like you until you showed real cajones with what you did at the convention. But now, I'm behind ya.
@RestoreHistory @SenMikeLee do something constructive, endorse @realDonaldTrump and tell your followers to do the same!
hold that corrupt executive branch's feet to the fire.  make them dance and explain EVERY step.
why hasn't anyone called on @pryan to start impeachment proceedings? Boehner set the rules?
congrats..... after 500 bull shit requests you finally got one right. Good job. Dont play pro baseball cause ud suck
Wow! Great job guys. Really. Thank you so much. Please. Let's us pay more of your salary so you can write letters.
you are so irrelevant Cruz change careers
Ya, you might want to request copies of all related communications, before they are deleted.
Stop grandstanding. Spend your time getting @realDonaldTrump taxes Find much more to run your next campaign
Why don't both of u do what u are supposed to do. Support the Republican nominee. U are pretty sad if u don't.
OBAMA NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE
@PSTeach4USFreed @SenMikeLee   I can Imagine Obama laughing so hard about your letter. Obama is a traitor! He will not respond.
Good luck with that!
And how many years have the Clinton hearing gone on!  Gotta keep your name in the news I guess  What a Joke!
Thank you sooo much.
Requested?   Try demanding and start hearings.
It's time for the appearance of lawless acts to come into question. If  true,has BO given Iran ok 4 Nuclear plants
nice! But we all know he will crawfish and lie about it. Per the usual.
Thank you! Know its hard but can y'all please help unify behind trump.no time now to b purists  #keepsenate2016!
They have been working on that fiction novel since the media reported it.
thanks to both of you for continuing to fight for the good of the American people!
Yeah. Good luck with that.
Stealing other Country's Money is like Israel stealing other people's lands. It's their money in the first place.
go home cruz quit spending tx mony
@ScottTameling @SenMikeLee 
Will you and Sen Lee please consider endorsing @Evan_McMullin 
A principled conservative choice.
Thank you.@SenMikeLee Thank you.
Stuff it.
@SenTedCruz @JimHoliway @SenMikeLee
nice you did this but you sould be supporting Trump the reason you lost is for one reason you are not a team player
Good luck with that. He'll be turning it over just like HRC turned over emails and transcripts.
TWO TEA PARTY SCUMBAGS , PLAYING THE LIE GAME .
EXCELLENT CRUZ!
WE the PEEPs NEED UR PUBLIC SUPPORT OF
@realDonaldTrump/@mike_pence NOW PLZZZZ!
WOMEN 4 TRUMP!!! ;D
why don't R's fight to win but they don't do anything thing about it to me R's are part of the problem Rhinos out
.@SenTedCruz .@SenMikeLee I wish he crumple this #BS and toss it in the garbage! Better yet, wait until February '17 to respond! #IranDeal
what do you care you both are helping to elect #CrookedHillary much worse than Obama! Traitors!!
How did you feel about Reagan trading guns to Iran for hostages?
Wishing you best of luck. We need answers and actions!
nothing will ever happen unless Trump wins in November all you're doing is the same old thing look corrupt that it
SURE, WASTE TIME instd of DOING YOUR JOBS;Know damn well it was sttlmnt&cant give US$$ 2Iran http://www.oregonlive.com/trending/2016/08/that_iran_400_million_payment_wasnt_really_a_secret.html …
not impressed  you've lost all that was good about you could never support again I'm a R & I'm tired of loosing
And do both think you will actually get it?!?  Don't hold your breath, we need you in the Senate!!
The $400M was just the cash, please don't forget the remaining $1.3B potion of the rest of the deal.
you got balls now?
leadership by strongly worded letter
Isn't there $400 million missing from a zika fund? I would look there first...
TODAY I and millions of conservative voters are asking you (our ex hero) to help beat HRC  come home Ted we need you
Secretary Kerry should reply to you in the language of diplomacy, le français, thusly:
"Monsieur, bite moi."

@SenMikeLee
Don't any of you think Obama should acct for the money? Or do you think he can draw money out like it his money!
We would rather have a full accounting why you 2 assholes sit there why Vets are still dying waiting to see a doc @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee
smartest thing I heard you say.
lol. I look forward to seeing his response. lyin' Ted will try to raise money off sending this letter. Total loser!
let's see how well that works a broken system at work
sadly you will be stonewalled
#NeverRubioCruzRyan
how did they deliver $150 billion to Iran? How many plane loads was that? #ObamaLies
Lyin Ted..lol
Good to see some senators demanding answers from Obama administration.
Yes. The problem is when the truth is revealed, nothing will be done about it.  Hence, #Trump
EXACTLY.
Good luck with that& how about supporting RepubvPres Candidate, that would help a lot more to fight #CorruptHillary
good luck!
to negotiate with terrorists is against our policy we all know this...and especially behind closed doors ...treason
#Yawn @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee
Have you absolutely nothing better to do after your failed presidential run...?
It's called accountability. Do ppl think that POTUS can take tax payers money, without Congress. Naive
truthfully, if true..this really can be construed as treasonous really honest
If you guys have balls demand Trump's Taxes. Idiots.
he's under audit jackass, u don't do that when ur under audit
Why not release the years that are not under audit?
he said he's been audited 4 last 15 yrs but I agree he should release something
it's good that we can agree on something.
Trumps a wildcard but we know we are screwed if Killary gets in
Actually that's where we don't agree.
so you would rather Mrs. Bill Clinton get elected?
