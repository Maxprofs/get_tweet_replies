@tedcruz Obama is a scumbag.
Standing with savages who want to exterminate Jews earns him the title amongst other moral failures.
You're a leftie. Moral doesn't mean anything to you. Move along.
hey aren't you the guy that got arrested for lewd behavior in a park?
Oh look, a troll. 
@SenTedCruz https://goo.gl/tAagQR  Israel,  makes public 200,000 documents on missing Yemenite children
@tedcruz BHO has now earned his Nobel prize. Not!
he is in good company with Arafat.
BHO new spokes person for PLO. GREAT LEGACY
and you're a stand up guy! Oops, there's a false equivalentcy again
@SenTedCruz @BarackObama Pres. Obama, your behavior, against Israel and Jews is not what we voted for! Nor, your ret. of Russia?
I've never been so enraged as I am when thinking of Obama or Kerry!Despicable pissants!
@SenTedCruz I can't wait to see it! Someone or congress needs to stop OBAMA from playing with Americans lives and poss have war
@tedcruz But the @gop doesn't believe the CIA or FBI re: Putin KGB style election hack! Ha f'en Ha!
@RoberRenteria #America does NOT feel this way! What a betrayal OBAMA! Can't wait until JANUARY 20TH! @realDonaldTrump #POTUS
@WeThePeopleFor @dcexaminer @RoberRenteria @realDonaldTrump that's ok Donna we'll benefit from his "hissy fit" & drive the future
@tedcruz We need fix Obama 's Kerry mess. We won't leave our loved Israel alone,
@netanyahu @POTUS is EVIL WE hate him more than Israel does...bye bye COUNT DOWN to SANITY
President Obama I love you and I wish we could put you in office for another 4 years
That is probably the only HONEST act that Obama performed during his Presidency. Netanyahu is pure evil!
that's the way Muslims are underhanded and cheap with know class
Would this actually surprise anyone?

@dcexaminer @ElfindaleLane
Never seen such obvious contempt for Israel as is on his face right here.
like TRUMP said, "After 1/20/17, things WILL BE Different"

UN BETTER Brace Themselves.. for Alpha Male President TRUMP
.@dcexaminer @tedcruz Add this to the list of ObamaShame --> Obamacare, Obamaphone, Obummer.
@ryanra  OBAMA, is a TERRORIST, FUNDING IRAN , and ISIS, and TRICKED the AMERICAN PEOPLE into supporting him, not once but twice
@VictoriaCoates The Mosad also has information on Obama real nationality
I have no doubt.  I don't need any evidence.  It's been apparent for the last 8years.
@causticbob 

Ruuuuskies!
@causticbob Obama interfered with the Israeli election and failed so now he wants to punish Israel for it.
@coinabs That bastard OB has done all he can to ruin our country. The SOB Muslim.
Israel needs to stop building illegal settlements period.
@jovanclordim what goes around comes around as he will soon find out when the rats start jumping ship
@tedcruz they got it from Putin
@SenTedCruz this two men have killed more Biafra's more than Buhari have killed, in there so called peaceful protests
The Administration should have pushed for the U.N. resolution.  Bibi needs to get the hell out of Palestine.

Obama is a traitor.
Good for our President! Israel is worst violator of human rights. UN needs to halt them!
i'm proud of the us governement. the palestinian territories have never been and will never belong to israel.
Team Obama's doing everything possible as  left wing A-holes before Jan 20. Expect more A-hole action later.
@USATODAY @guardian @WSJ I have always believed vicious, EVIL Netanyahu MURDERED Israel PM Yitzhak Rabin, a great and good man.
Rake that POS over the coals! #IStandwithIsrael
@SenTedCruz Bet on it.
@AppSame If true it was done w/out knowledge of the American people. Don't always agree with Israeli tactics but stand with them
@SenTedCruz Then you can bet the farm, they do. God help the Democrats, I won't.
@SenTedCruz I have no doubt you are correct in reporting this. Dems beware, truth is coming. Life isn't a lie.
@tedcruz two faced traitor to Israel and to United States with Iran deal
@tedcruz If true, this is despicable. @netanyahu we stand with you.
@SenTedCruz So what? Do we continue to allow Israel to build settlements in Palestine simply because they're more powerful?
"Stand with anybody that stands right, stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong."
@SenTedCruz I have no doubt.
Very Sad! Israel is our only true friend in the region.
@SenTedCruz Of course the administration did. They continue to resolution away US Constitutional rights.  NWO
he is nothing but scrum he never like Israel. Can.t wait,until Jan. 20 kiss your A_ S good by!

@tedcruz
they are disgracing Israel. American people love Benjamin. Why cant the obama administration cut it out.
@tedcruz No money to UN.
You are a propaganda outlet!

Because @POTUS is anti-Semitic pro-Muslim with many hidden agendas and an extremely sore loser!!  Good riddance @POTUS!!
Obama has been nothing but rude, condescending and plain USELESS supporting Israel, thank God Trump will undo it!
Sign of Obuma's hate for the Jews and Christians. This bathroom boy is nothing more than a devil worshiping muslim.
@SenTedCruz this two men have killed more Biafra's more than Buhari have killed, in there so called peaceful protests
TRUE
@SenTedCruz bibi ,next time u c this putz punch him in the mouth just once for fun
@SenTedCruz they don't have to have anything we know he is traitor Muslim sale out
@SenTedCruz I don't doubt it. Everything else he has done leads me to believe this.
I don't find Obama to be a supporter of Israel, in fact a supporter of nothing not even America.
@SenTedCruz Netanyahu best learn that all things leading to peace can be only his way. This was no new issue.
@tedcruz meanwhile you support Spencer's anti-Jewish march in Montana. Give me a break
The most hateful president we have ever had in the U.S.
@SenTedCruz So we are concerned about using legal maneuvers to lobby a vote but not Russia using illegal maneuvers to sway ours?
if the whole world has problems with Israel maybe they should consider regime change.
Not surprised. Obama has shown his hatred toward Israel and Netanyahu from the day he came into office and it seems to me he doesn't care
@SenTedCruz Senator, shame on u. U know better than 2 retweet questionable material. Don't catch the Trump cronies' bad habits.
@SenTedCruz Disgusting behave! !!
No Shit, Sherlock. Obama hates Israel! @SenTedCruz
@realDonaldTrump 
POTUS is such a J_e_Rk! 
 so glad when his term is up but don't expect him to be quiet as GW has!
I am thinking Obama wants the ME in turmoil for the next President.  He hates losing.
Publish it, please.
SURPRISE! He spent our tax dollars trying to rig Israel's last election, too.
Get the UN OUT of America!
@SenTedCruz one gets the impression here that its the US that needs israel...
@HillaryClinton "What difference, at this point, does it make!!". Lolz
Good. This was 50 years overdue.
@tedcruz the bible says " I will bless those who bless Israel and will curse those who curse Israel. Thanks Obama!!
liberals and Muslims are like that
@tedcruz 

Talk about a sore LOSER
@POTUS @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich  @DonaldJTrumpJr
We should have authored UNRes. Israel takes our $38b check, doesn't listen when told to obey int'l law. Dont mess w US.
I believe it! Obama hates Israel.

US support for Israel vs #Palestinians was primary 9/11 motivation:
@tedcruz Then can we get our $38bn back? Isreal is a regional power that can defend themselves!
@tedcruz #FecklessForeignPolicy driven by a Hamas sympathizer. We're just lucky he's out shortly.
@tedcruz about time Israel is called out for crossing the borders and colonizing.
For 8 years Obama has no opposition to anything he has done. His UN move was expected in political circles for 2 years.
created it too JAN 20TH
.@dcexaminer .@tedcruz Well Teddy. I guess the rule of law applies only when it suits you.
release the info and embarrass the 
@POTUS so glad this failed leader and these last 8 years of continual failed leadership is ending. He has destroyed the USA.
@tedcruz Obama 's agenda,  Is  no secret , his agenda is a very radical 
Islamic one .
SEND THIS MAN HOME PACKING WITH HIS FAMILY.
"I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you." -gen. 12:3 God doesn't lie. This is on Obama, not us.
@classygal21 I truly believe hell awaits him, if he don't ask Gods forgiveness !
how about all the lies of not building settlements and then opening up more settlements.
@tedcruz glad when this corruption is gone.  after his presidency he's will be that annoying neighbor you can't get rid of .
and this surprises who???
@tedcruz : Obama is the biggest terrorist threat to America.
@TedCruz. It's time to bring these jackboot UN THUGS DOWN!!!!  Lead the way Senator Cruz!!!!   
O. OBAMA  YOU ARE A RAT IN THE TRAP. ARE U BITING OFF MORE THAN U CAN CHEW? U DON'T PLAY WITH GODS CHILDREN.
@tedcruz the "Palestinians" do not have historical right to Jerusalem.
So What? Who thinks UN ambassadors ever do stuff without the approval of their country's leaders? Are you that naive?
@monkwatch  Obama the loser.
@monkwatch Obama pushing his Nation of Islam #globalist agenda. Will the blind EVER see?!?
#012017 cannot come soon enough
Just listened to the ambassador on CNN he said they will turn it over to the new administration very interesting
@POTUS @PressSec Obama's a coward & sooner he's gone better off US & Israel will be;his FP is worst in US history, a disaster
@tedcruz @netanyahu @realDonaldTrump will change that immediately so sorry at this moment what we have isnt a president.
very plausible ( with Ram Emanuel)
@tedcruz are we surprised? Obama has never truly supported Israel.
@tedcruz Our only democratic alley in the Middle East. BHO has disdain for Israel! Yet all the lib Jews voted 4 this loser. SMDH
Traitor to the US, enemy to Israel. That's @POTUS.
we know is full of his self it shows big time he acts like he saved america he screwed america more like it hired sharpton crazy
@tedcruz of course they did.  They also messed with the past election..  what will they not do?  This is true evil
@tedcruz what did we expect from a Muslim administration?
obummer is a traitor
Well....He was disrespect to OBAMA about a year ago by speaking directly to Congress to go around him. Pay back is a mother.
@tedcruz I don't get it. Wasn't Israel settling on land that belongs to Palestine? Politicians got mad when Russia did it.....
@tedcruz shame on the USA for ever voting for this muslin president. Can't wait until Trump takes over. I am pro Israel 
@tedcruz God bless Israel and His people.
so now..if you could do it all over again ...?
I will imagine your next book may be a cook book of sorts?
@tedcruz #looser
@kittreantanner I am sure he did as this is his style. Very evident he is anti- Semitic!
Obama MUST be Impeached and tried for TREASON !!!! @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
Obama has been an enemy of Israel and Christianity from the start! Bye, bye, Obama :)
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! Pray that the Trump administration will stand solidly in support of Israel!!!
@tedcruz @potus is just a tad Antisemitic truly shows how little BHO is on the world stage.The most wasted Presidency in HISTORY
@tedcruz It appears BHO is behind every American disaster. 25 days very long in Obama terms
No suprise, don't doubt that for a minute.
God bless Israel, God's chosen people.
Yeh, and it's successes like that that give obama that smug kindergartner puss shown in the picture...
@tedcruz Seems to me Pres. O loves Israel but hates Jews. UN Res + Iran makes it look like he wants jews out of Israel?
if true, it's one more reason i like President Obama.
Thank you Jesus, for showing your power before we celebrated your birth! 
that why they abstained from voting for it....right. Riiiight. Your hard on for Obama is small but visible.
No other way to say this-Obama disgusts me. Remember his first foreign speech was to Muslim world including muslim brotherhood.
Trump is on the way. Obama could never hide his hatred for Bibi and Israel and now everyone knows it. I STAND WITH ISRAEL.
@tedcruz Americans stand with Israel!!obama is a disgrace
@tedcruz yeshit's pathetic and shameful and embarrassment American people
@tedcruz I'm sorry for our president Israel. Things will change January 20th.
You must be talking about university and college campuses
@tedcruz @POTUS Of course he did. The only people obama fools are the blind democrats! #blindleadingtheblind
LINES DRAWN ARE PRETTY CLEAR. NO GUESSWORK HERE?
Despicable what Obama did!
@tedcruz I BELIEVE NETANYAHU
Bitter, petulant lil' president... Meet the new boss same as the old boss... #LyenDon
@tedcruz If Bibi isn't fair and balanced, who is?
@tedcruz Another feather in Obama Legacy.
@tedcruz Rep. Joe Wilson was a man ahead of his time!
they believe the lie, that national socialism (nazi's)was right wing.
@23aaaaf619fc4a7 
That will change in a few weeks. President Obama will be remembered as He was President?
Of course he did.
@zeroinscw Trump stole this election by using the Russians in the FBI he's not our president
is this really that surprising? He's hated them from the beginning unfortunately
ISIS isn't whom worries Obama but proof that Extremist Pakistani's can get into US & take orders from Al-Qaeda & ISIS his FEARS.
it's a shame we're losing a real president and putting in a thief and a liar

Gorilla justice!
GOD BLESS ISRAEL 
Hear, O Israel: The LORD thy God is one LORD. Deut6:4
Obama attempting to portray self to ISIS in mannerism to protect him from assassination by ISIS; indeed @realDonaldTrump Freedom
What? He's stopping an assassination of self by ISIS? How honestly did you come to that epic theory?
No doubt there you could tell by Samantha powers half hearted Response as well as here over prepaired text written weeks ago
Did anyone ever doubt that? Obama's Islam roots show in his treatment of Isreal
he's a liar and a thief and he'll destroy this country and probably the world
Too late, lying Obama & Clinton  damaged US profundly. Would have Muslimize us if we hadn't stopped
