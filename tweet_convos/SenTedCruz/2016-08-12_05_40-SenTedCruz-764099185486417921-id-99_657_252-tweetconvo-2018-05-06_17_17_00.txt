Don't worry, he is only doing this so US defense contractors can make millions on Israeli missiles used to bomb them
I'd say true if BHOdidnt hate the Jewish people so much.
Joking about BHO's intentions. Israel may act independently if threatened though:
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @HillaryClinton   Obama has created  a monster with failed policies favoring terror growth
@tedcruz I can't say WTF loud enough, seriously.
@FreeBeacon Just what we need.  Iran with a nuclear bomb and Hillary Clinton in the White house. Both a death sentence
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon if if you believe this why are you supporting Hillary
@tedcruz Iran has plenty of oil. They sure don't need nuclear plants for Entergy!
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon I've always said that @POTUS & @HillaryClinton  are the biggest terrorist America has ever known
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon Israel won't care what BO says.
@DividendMaster lol this is a joke!
@FreeBeacon Obama is doing all he can to see Iran with nuke weapons before a new prez can stop them . Democrats are insane
@FreeBeacon Sayyyy whaaaat?!
@JamesRitch1 No big deal, these are ONLY for domestic power, barry pinky swore on it
@NoSilentConsent @FreeBeacon has the plane landed?
@NoSilentConsent @FreeBeacon
@tedcruz WHY?!?!? This is insane!!
the bigger picture is the eye in the sky sees all people r so quik 2 assume or worry about some ish they shouldn't be worried about
@Richzeoli @FreeBeacon I hear it's the lasted micro technology. Reactor can fit on the end of a missile.
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon God help us all!
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon.I have no reason to believe Obama likes America if he is giving Iran nuke plants. Go Trump!
@SenTedCruz time to vote for Trump
@tedcruz I don't know why anyone is surprised, he just admitted to give 400M, IN CASH, to Iran. What's left to be ashamed of?
@FreeBeacon 
The beginning of the end
@FreeBeacon .
@SenTedCruz just out of curiosity: is there anything Iran could do that WOULDN'T be ok under this wonderful deal?
@FreeBeacon wtf
@FreeBeacon @SenTedCruz  Iran must have made some nice donations to the Clinton & Obama Foundations
@tedcruz Watch out Americans, Obama and Clinton will destroy our Nation.Trump correct: Obama & Clinton is on the side of ISIS!!!!!
@FreeBeacon ChaChing! And the list of Obama's treasonous acts grows yet again.
@FreeBeacon Christ this half-white president is giving aid & comfort 2 the enemy
When's the trial?
I hope these New Nuclear Plants are used to destroy undesirable neighbors....
@FreeBeacon  That's all Israel needs is for iran to have nukes. Iran has said that as soon they have nukes they will destroy israel
@FreeBeacon  I think Trump is correct about Obama founding Isis.
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon Yet U support Hillary in Nov. #traitor #rino #demoinhiding
@FreeBeacon Jan 2017 can't come soon enough. Go Trump!
HOW is this not criminal?!
@SenTedCruz ummm this is bullshit
@rxpatriot46 Fuck
@FreeBeacon but years it would take to get approval from these bureaucrats to build nuclear plant in the #UnitedStates is daunting.
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon more of Obama threat to America..
Idiots
RT @Kredo0: BREAKING: Obama Admin Gives Green Light for Iran to Build Two New Nuclear Plants; Confirms Nuke Plants OK Under Deal https://t.â€¦
That's a big BETRAY to Israel but Israel is ready...to shut down any nuclear facility.Obama is the leader of ISIS. BETRAYING AMERICA
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon old news.  obama & his administration has a short time in office they don't hide stuff like this anymore.
Thank you Senator Bob Corker, for paving the way for a nuclear-armed Iran.
this will just continue with Hillary as POTUS. Thanks to Ted Cruz for not endorsing/supporting Trump.
You contradict yourself.
@tedcruz : bye bye, Israel!
ALL GOV LIED TO US
@tedcruz Makes perfect sense for a non-first world country that small, sitting on a pool of oil, to have TWO MORE nuke plants.
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon the first radical Islamic president is trying to destroy America
His Presidency has done more to endanger this nation than all previous presidents combined.
@tedcruz What happened to 15 years?
@SenTedCruz remember when Bush did nothing after a North Korean nuke test? I do.
I wonder if @POTUS BFF #JeffImelt  of General Electric is involved in any of the #IranNuclearDeal ?
@FreeBeacon ,THATS WHY OBUMMER IS THE COFOUNDER OF THIS TERRORIST GROUP.
@JimKelley7 , we're nuts ?
@tedcruz two entirely diff animals. Can't weaponize nukes in light-water.  Buy a science book please
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon. Just remember that Bibi warned the world about that. No surprise there
Why has @POTUS made it easier to build nuclear power in Iran than America?
@tedcruz @FoxNews @ericbolling   LOL Obama to USA " We need gun control" Obama to Iran " Its Okay to build a nuclear plant "
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon And if you think, Secetary of State Hillary Clintons uranium deal was not paet of this plan your wrong.
@FreeBeacon wth? Valerie Jerrett# Obama ## Hillary
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon Not only did Obama green light the construction, he gave them $400 million for construction cost, wakeup people
And Iran has agreed to short notice international inspections that will prevent them from processing Plutonium.
@tedcruz     I have been wondering whose team Obama was on ...   In the past week it is evident not team USA
in the last 8 years he hasn't been on America's side
@tedcruz Business as Usual for this administration! Corrupt and inept!
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon I suspect it will be a couple of years or more before they r active, Pes Cruz will use bunker busters in 2020.
@FreeBeacon Quote from @netanyahu - this is a very bad idea. #StandWithIsrael #ObamaSUCKS #IranDeal #CruzCrew #StandUpWithEvan #tcot
@FreeBeacon Can't stop the Nuclear agenda.
For better or worse.
Hypocrites may say so.
@tedcruz #YGTBSM Appeasing #POTUS cannot be relieved by another Appeasing Islamic Shiite sympathizer in @HillaryClinton VOTE #TRUMP
I think he's intentionally giving them nuke missile capability to strike the U.S. and Israel so Islam can rule this nation.
@tedcruz    Thats good news!   Maybe they will toast themselves with it!
Dear TED, Is this really Breaking News? Or was it AGREED to last yr.Tell The Truth! Sincerely, Progressive, NO Nukes.
it would bring them closer to enrichment
Dirty bomb is the so what
@tedcruz I can't wait all the armchair nuclear physicists to tell us how Israel is going to be destroyed tomorrow
@tedcruz OMG~distorting evidence on ISIS~directed by Valerie Jarrett&Muslim Brotherhood Huma & Cheryl Mills~cooking  books on ISIS
Looks like they just xeroxed the N. Korean deal and changed it to Iran.
@tedcruz is this more play for pay?
@tedcruz @FreeBeacon what--- Obama is trying to kill us all
@FreeBeacon These are 4 "energy" & if Iran can convert them into weapons, then world can have fun again. Just another transformation
@FreeBeacon And this is a surprise,  HOW....  EXACTLY?
.@Kredo0 @FreeBeacon 

WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
@FreeBeacon what? I thought this was to delay their building
