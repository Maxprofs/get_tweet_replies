sorry to have missed the debate
The future is Democratic! 2018! #RiseUp
Looks like Cruz was really feeling the Bern. Nice job on the part of @BernieSanders.
Hilarious!  You have a great sense of humor, this was a joke, right?
More Talk
kick his ass Ted!
Ted can't find asses except in the dark when he secretly sucks on his partner's bare bottom. #awkward
or Trump's as the need arises
I love Ted Cruz but I'm boycotting @CNN . I don't want to help their ratings.
LOL. Please do. And please put a plastic bag over your head to cover your eyes and save society.
why do the people on the left always, always reply with nastiness?
#death to those with #preexistingconditions and all those #oldpeople and #sickbabies.Oh, well.
I happen 2b 1 of those old disabled who paid in all my life&struggle2survive can't even get my disability
That is unconscionable. All Americans deserve health care and dignity.
thank u
yes
I hope you do an AMAZING job for our country. This is a convo that needs to be had & a debate that needs to be won!
actually Bernie is one of few representatives who cares about the people of the nation.
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/RepMarkMeadows/status/829092786574065664 … (Ranked 10th for Feb 7.)
Cruz is a corporate republican and useless. Bernie is one of few true patriots who serve in congress
I agree. He would ba a great pick for Supreme Court!
Canadians just shake their heads at the dogmatic Stupidity of the U.S. on healthcare.
@CNN @BernieSanders I don't think the left has the ability 2really listen and learn.they seem 2 have a mental block
I was just saying this about the coporate democrats and republicans myself.
@CNN @BernieSanders Why Socialism fails!
Except when socializing profits.
ate bernies lunch while bernie was waving fairy dust around the stage
You will face the consequence of your DeVos vote in 2018.
lol he'll win big again
talking about GOP as a whole. And not just the senate- eyes on the house. Resistance is building more rapidly than tea party
GOP is picking up seats in the House and Senate. Dems are done.
Until the crash.
I can't watch the Crazy News Network. They lie or twist President Trump's words to make it looks like a lie.
CNN are desperate for their ratings to go up. You could start by not lying on Trump.
When Trump denies saying things the day after he says them?
I applaud  Cruz for doing it..as this is our only hope for the countryTwo-sided debates But Bernie won
Darn I missed it!!
Heathsavings account?  Buying insurance?  HOW?
impossible4me0 income 4 3 years,0disability,held up in approval I guess,how can I pay r save.impossible
you mean lying Ted?
I am watching right now, and Sen. Cruz is schooling Sen. Sanders.  Bernie is pushing Medicare for All vs. Freedom.
@CNN @BernieSanders I agree
ted can churn bullshit like hardly any other.
@cnn Why is Ted dancing around the "pre-existing condition" issue? It must be a pillar of replacement. Say it!!
my only problem as a republican  is that nobody trusts @tedcruz . He ran a dirty campaign thus noone respect him
Cruz mouth open out comes lies
I refuse to watch anything on NBC, ABC,CBS, & CNN!. I estimate 85-90% is fake or twisted news!
who cares?
Americans will loose Hitler will win
Nah. I'll pass on lying Ted
@DavidSPJM @tedcruz Nope. That network doesn't exist on my television.
zodiac
Should be good.
it'll be the first time in a long time I tune into that shit stain of a news network. Only for my man @SenTedCruz!
your friend is a sad and lonely puppet...
rather stick a fork in my eye!
#NOshame #NoSoul
Thanks @RepMarkMeadows for the kind words about my senator @tedcruz #CruzCrew
why don't you educate people on what ACA is instead of just saying obamacare.
explain to these people that obamacare is just a stupid term you keep using instead of ACA
you should explain to people ACA make sure employers give reasonable insurance to employees
Bernie will send his ass home
GO BERNIE
@MyBrianLeyh He will tear up the Democratic myth.
@kksheld @tedcruz I would love seeing Cruz chew up sanders but I can't stomach watching anything on CNN
We'll see how much the deck is stacked against Cruz. I'm sure he'll be up against Sanders and the news anchors.
Oh No, I have to tape @TuckerCarlson! I have to look up and see what channel @CNN is on.

why on that hack network Mr Cruz
@Frank_RB96 @tedcruz the Zodiac Killer makes his return
I won't watch Cruz shame Americans who need affordable HC into suffering w/o. Few things are more deplorable.
How can you trust anything he says? He bashes Trump in the primaries, but seems to back his every play now.
You confuse talking spin & smoke & mirrors w/ being articulate. I won't be drinking the Kool-aid, thank you.
If I thought Cruz would actually talk facts re ACA I would watch but he will only talk GOP alt facts. NO THANKS!
be nice to Ted
other Ted Cruz skills include: lacking a backbone, disregarding science, and subservience to Herr Trump!
@djdoobs @tedcruz I've blocked CNN. Friends don't let friends watch CNN
nothing like watching Ted refuse to EVER answer the question asked. He is truly the #kingofbullshit
Who is moderating the 'debate'?
@THETXEMBASSY @tedcruz @CNN @BernieSanders Wont miss it!
Any law that's based on lie--U can keep your doc. etc,--shd be repealed. Affordable care act is misnomer-skyrktcost
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Cruz is a sycophant, not true conservative nor Republican.  Has no true moral compass: now Always Trump
It's not humane 2 dump poor ppl into Medicaid; they should have choices like everyone else; Socialized med=disaster
@CNN @BernieSanders Must I turn to CNN? To watch Criz destroy the socialist I just might have to.
CNN?
YUK!!
can't wait!!! First time to turn @CNN on in a long time will do it this once lol
I refuse to watch the Clinton Nazi Network. Cruz will kick Sanders freebie ass!!
Your excellent tweet about your friend @tedcruz has been added to a blog essay I published today.

@SenTedCruz @tedcruz @CNN @BernieSanders like Cruz a lot but this is just a desperate ratings grab by #CNNfakenews
I have no doubt Ted, can out debate the Bern...Cruz is a very good orator&facts on his side..but I am boycottingCNN
#BoycottCNN
Sorry can't watch CNN
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz 
I don't like fake news @CNN
Be careful Ted Questions was given ahead of the debate to
Sanders .
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz Too bad it's on #CNN.
I can't it's on CNN....sorry love Ted Cruz though!
masterdebator
I'd love to, but I refuse to watch CNN, so I'll wait for the clips on here. I won't give them ratings or ad $s.
mass debater.
Ted is going to shred the poor old communist  Even going into a hostile and uneven playing field, Ted's wipe floor.
give um an education senatore.
Sorry! I don't watch fake news networks.
Sanders fanatic
While I know @tedcruz will disembowel Sanders in the Debate I refuse to give @CNN #FakeNews the viewership they need
can't wait to see Ted tear him up. Gonna have to force myself to watch CNN.
LOL. Then you clearly need new friends, sweetheart! Bless your heart.
Sanders doesn't stand a chance...
@CNN @BernieSanders will Bernie comb his hair for the debate?
Probably not, but someday, he may find his balls...
Funny a Cruz fan would say that.@BernieSanders
I'll be there, wouldn't miss it.
it's ted Cruz vs sanders & cnn, very brave.
Oh goodness, whatever will the Zodiac killer do against such a stacked deck?!
he is a pretty good debater, better than Bernie. Taller than Bernie too I bet. 
All evidence points to Zodiac killer at 5-8/5-10 and Bernie at 5-11.
Sanders is going to hilariously run policy circles around Cruz's podium
he has no policy. He's a sell out 6 homes? Wake up blind sheep the slaughterhouse is around bend

Best part? No Candy Crowley playing lib wingman.
wish I could watch but cannot tune my tv to #CNN ever again
And another Snowflake is in danger of melting! Damn that globe for warming!!!
Chew that LIBERAL SOCIALIST a new asshole TED!! But don't STEP in whatever CRAP he's spewing!!
Hope he blows leftist Sanders out of the water!
he might just kill him #zodiac
Don't let @cnn get away with dirty tricks!
