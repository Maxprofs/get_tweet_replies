After he's been found guilty? @SenTedCruz @newzealblog
Here is the text of the #ElChapoAct https://www.cruz.senate.gov/files/documents/Bills/20170425_EL%20CHAPO%20Act.pdf …
I'm not comfortable with the whole asset forfeiture thing, unless convicted. @newzealblog @SenTedCruz
Seems Cruz agrees with me. @newzealblog @SenTedCruz
Do It. The wall is not only a physical barrier. It sends a message loud and clear. We have had enough!
Why didn't you support the border bill? #Hypocrite #GlobalistShill #LyingTed #Useless #UntrusTED Go back to Canada where you belong.
sounds like a good idea
Thank you Senator Cruz!
Great idea Ted Cruz
@SenTedCruz are you remotely aware of the implications of actually building a border wall? #ElChapoAct Time to serve TX not your party
Dear #Texas, PLEASE DO NOT VOTE FOR ADAM BELL. He is not interested in the security of the United States. #MAGA #ElChapoAct #ElChapoActNOW
Great idea except the Mexican government is in cahoots with El Chapo and they won't cooperate
@RepublicanChick Woo-hoo about dam time.
How about a little cash for a liver transplant for You Know Who?
Think this is brilliant!  This is the out of the box thinking that Congress needs desperately.
Genius Idea! ThankYou! ThankYou! #WeThePeople #StandUnited With You & Our @POTUS  #PASSTheElChapoAct #WednesdayMotivation #BuildThatWall
This is a joke
#BUILDTHEWALL
Big and beautiful
Use that illegal drug money for something positive, let these people enter America through the front door.

Or the "ECA" in future pleadings and briefs.
increíble que haya gente tan pendeja como usted Por eso están como están Sabe lo que es oferta y demanda? De Tarea quién consume
 what is happening with the tax on cash wires? That was another good idea?
Will this just take 51 votes Sir?
Si esto fuera posible? Quien estaria pagando el muro? Los adictos gringos no MEXICO
Billions from seized drug money by ICE!
Recreprocity baby! That's "Our money". Take it. We found it. Take it. That's OUR MONEY.
This is an extremely creative way to get the wall built! And get Mexico to pay for it! @berkswomen
Border security is good. Walls are giant boondoggles. Let's be clear on what's what.
viva el Chapo, Cruz!  You understand me Hispanic shit.
Thank you.  Proud you are representing Texans.
Awesome idea!   @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@SurvivorMed Oh..that's what Trump means when he says Mexico WILL pay for the wall.
Cant wait until they go after regular folks. Legalize drugs now and stop the gangsters.
Way to be Senator Cruz. Great move!
Some kind of special stupid.
So, you're a boastful socialist gangster who takes a firm stand against property rights of the servile and idiotic electorate? Good to know!
We are finding several ways for Mexico to pay for the wall. This is genius.
Awesome idea! Do it. #BuildTheWall @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @potus @RandPaul 
#StopTheDrugs
#brilliant
@Justicegroupie2 BUILD THE WALL !! #stoptrafficking #pedogate #obamagate PROTECT AMERICANS
Like. Like. Like.
I'm getting that loving feeling again! Way to go Cruz! Hopefully our next Supreme Court Justice.
@RepublicanChick Brilliant thinking do it .
@cmarkcarroll 
AMEN!
If Obama can gv Iran billion in cash seized in the 70's with out Congress approval y not? 
Brilliant
Can part go for treatment for addicts also? Help those people suffering from the damage he imported?  So we can rebuild our citizens as well
this sounds like a great down payment... put the criminals cash to work making America great again... awesome
Fantastico! Going to celebrate this idea at taco Tuesday. This is a great plan unless you're a sanctuary city mayor in need of voters.
Why save billions when we can spend trillions? (Obama 2009)
Excellent do it
Yes !! We the people support the Act !!
dinero deberia de entregarse a familias de victimas inocentes del narcotrafico en Mx gracias a la demanda de drogas de  E.U
El chapo can pay for wall!
Good grief, how many times you going to tweet the same lunacy?  Seriously, what a stupid bill..use $ for American's needs not a DJT ego wall
Igualmente hay que detener el paso de armas de USA-MEX
ALL Bull Chit Politics to sell a rabid gestapo asset seizure bill thats going to widely be used against everyday INNOCENT US Citizens assets
Civil asset forfeiture is theft.
Yes we do want a #BorderWall    #BuildTheWall.
Great idea, and I don't even like LyinTed! One caveat, How long will the courts keep the money tied up? Praying it works out #BuildTheWall
@AGJeffBSessions    @SpeakerRyan    @realDonaldTrump   @POTUS    #BuildTheWall. #NoMoreExcuses.
Point blank thinking!
TX border agents routinely ignore the drugs entering the US, the prefer to wait until dealers are leaving with cash to stop

Yes let's get it passed
Way to go Ted. Fight for America !!!
Great bill Senator. Finally someone working WITH the president to tackle these issues and reduce our deficit. Both can be accomplished.
The best use of an acronym I've seen in forever. Well played, Senator!
@Trump_Support HOW ABOUT USING THOSE FUNDS TO BUILD THE WALL?MAGA
That's AWESOME!!!!
Excellent Job !! Finally,,,,,,it's time for convicts to pay back!!!
 love that idea!
Good idea Ted smart thinking
#ElChapoActNOW #BRILLIANT #AbsoluteGenius I Senator Cruz! Let's make it go viral #OverAndOverAgain #USA #MAGA #BTW
The EL CHAPO Act will reserve billions in assets forfeited from El Chapo & drug lords to pay for border security http://bit.ly/2otlZ7B  
Why is NAFTA bad Ted?
Texans along the border don't want a border wall. If he was in touch with his constituents he'd know this. However, it's why he's done in 18
Then you are not living in the real world with your neighbors. Enjoy your wall buddy! 
Take drug money that the law enforcement take from drug dealers
And use it to pay for fencing
What forfeiture act was designed 2 do! Be used where the Criminal Acts occurred & support enforcement in those areas! #BuildThatWall #MAGA
PRAISE GOD! ANSWERED PRAYER FOR AMERICA'S WALL AGAINST "ILLEGAL INTRUDERS!" PAID IN FULL BY GOD'S PLAN!
ted go on chapo
We don't want a border wall in Texas. #2018
#CantbruisetheCruz2018
If he builds a wall and blocks the Rio Grande, he will lose.
That won't happen
A wall through Big Bend would turn Texans against him.
He obviously won't do that because he'll lose his seat. He's obviously going to listen to his constituents
yes 
I  this, what an awesome idea
And the wall!
Get it done! No excuses. Also great idea.
Love it!!!!! GREAT !!!!
Ted go on @CHAPOTRAPHOUSE
He literally used a tunnel
Oh wow I had no idea
Brilliant

BUILD THAT WALL AND MEXICO WILL PAT FOR IT!!
Pat for it. Who Tom Brady? I don't think there's a Hispanic @Patriots and I doubt he'd pay for it. #IdiotTrumpSupporter #NoWall
BUILD THE WALL!!!
