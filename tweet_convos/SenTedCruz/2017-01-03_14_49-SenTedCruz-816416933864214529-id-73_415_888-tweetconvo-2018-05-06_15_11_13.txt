@saintinthemakin Yea, TED!!
Does anyone know why Congress passed the 17th Amendment that changed the way we elect Senators?
The 17A removed the States from the election process, and made election of Senators possible through popular vote. This is bad
It's as bad as it would be if we elected our President by popular vote instead of by electoral college.
Before the 17th Amendment...States could do a recall vote and remove Senators from office at ANY TIME!
@DrSueDVM thanks Ted, you are a man of integrity.
Why the Hell isn't he President Elect?
people didn't want a person of integrity, wanted a loud mouth chicken draft dodger.
Ya think? Don't suppose I could put you on a list of intelligent persons? (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)
As usual, @SenTedCruz is doing what he said he would do if he was president. God bless him! Grateful we have Cruz in the Senate
Article V if that doesn't work @COSProject
@SenTedCruz I wish Cruz's term were more limited
use amndmt 22 to sep presidence! TY Ted!
@SenTedCruz FINALLY AN AMENDMENT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON (depending on the # of years he's taking about). 1 term=Sen; 2 terms=House
No way in hell that most of those DC politicians will vote themselves out of a lifetime appointment. Gotta love Cruz for trying.
And it's a notch he doesn't get credit for among DC media.  Points for bringing up issues at the very least.
@SenTedCruz when I thought it couldn't get any worse. You TOTALLY redeem yourself!
@ChuckNellis Good for him.  Now it's time for us to repeatedly contact our representatives and tell them we want this!
@SenTedCruz Thank you! Thank You! Thank You! 
@SenTedCruz Ted you are my new hero. Your campaign was a disaster but you are doing the right things all of a sudden. Good job!
Not all of a sudden, he's been doing what his constituents wanted him to when we elected him!
@SenTedCruz 

Let's see if it goes through
that would be the best thing for the American citizens
@GovPenceIN @GenFlynn Cruz is biggest sycophant of all as he helped craft Iran-Cuban-TPP-SPP-NAU in Ottawa, CND
but I want Cruz to be in the senate forever
Whomever down votes this has oligarch written all over them.
@DrSueDVM We already gave term limits. It is called ELECTIONS. Worked real well this past NOV. Founding Fathers got it right.
it can't come soon enough these career politicians have got to go this would really drain the swamp
@tedcruz @RepDeSantis Thank you!
@SenTedCruz for Supreme Court.                                time for @realDonaldTrump to make the the selection #SupremeCourt
GO Ted GO!
Bet he gets laughed out of town !
@SenTedCruz Well done Senator!
good call Ted. Only a true American with the desire to serve the ppl would do this. I hope it passes but some would stay forever
@SenTedCruz Terminal limits are EXACTLY what we need. Go Cruz!
@realDonaldTrump IT'S TIME!
@dwthompson1945 I'm all for that!
@SenTedCruz Thank you. Good man. Go TEXANS!!
That's not going anywhere!
Need this!
WELL WITH THE WAY THE TEXAS SCHOOL SYSTEM IS RUN. CANCEL ALL TRMS USELESS
Bravo Cruz about bloody time!
McCain McConnell Schumer Pelosi Warren will all oppose it but we will get names extend to buracrats lifetime blocking bottle neck jobs
@MaryCatron Like that's going to happen. @COSProjectTX They won't vote to undermine their own power.
@SenTedCruz right after he sharts himself
What took so long?
@SenTedCruz Who does he think term limits would help? The Republicans?  The Democrats?
it will be interesting to see who supports and who is against this bill.
@SenTedCruz you know that means you too Ted
Those fat cats are never going to go for it
Just let Ted Cruz handle the Senate with Rand Paul and Rubio beside him.
@SenTedCruz bills like that should be voted on by the people not the self-serving politicians
Miracles never cease!  I actually agree with you!
1st 2go- Pelosi, Feinstein, Graham, McCain
now that's a fair bipartisan choice!
Finally! Something CRUZ and I agree upon.
Should have been done a long time ago - next stop, repeal Congressional pensions.
THANK YOU! You get that public wants #termlimits to reduce the political class. Gov't service s/b honor not career.
@SenTedCruz Good job Teddy Bear! All the Republicans need 2 stick together 2 get it done! Let's get it done HELP Mr Trump!MAGA
put the pressure on people. Get rid of these career politicians!
@SenTedCruz I don't want politicians in office for decades. Term limits can control corruption.  I am for term limits!
@SenTedCruz would b great but never pass. Suicide for those voting for it
No it will show exactly who the Rhinos are!
@SenTedCruz 
@SenTedCruz   Wonderful! Finally a politician who's listening 2 the People!  
And way 2 go on restoring the Israeli capitol!
Ted has always listened to his constituents.  People have really messed up believing MSM about Ted.
@SenTedCruz Term limits are a BAD idea! It gives too much power to lobbyists who have no term limits! Exhibit A-California.
Good move Ted!
I 4give Cruz- this is good
Next voter ID
I'm glad you 4 give him, he really is a great, stand up guy
You are the best...if all politicians were like you then we would have few problems.
@SenTedCruz it won't fly...@SpeakerRyan needs a full time job along with his buddy @NancyPelosi
@SenTedCruz it will get shot down by all of the career politicians but I'm glad someone made move on term limits
@SenTedCruz Only way Washington gets integrity back!
Here we go....all aboard The TRUMP TRAIN #MAGA
good.
