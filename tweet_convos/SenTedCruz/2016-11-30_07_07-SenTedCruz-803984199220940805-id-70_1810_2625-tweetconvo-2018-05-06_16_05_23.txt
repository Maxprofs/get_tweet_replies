Hurrah!

@PoliticalShort He was the most inspirational leader during WW II. Hate to think what might have happened without him.

@BillKristol Not many leaders like Churchill.  And then there is Trump, God forbid there r  twolike him, the other extreme.
@Hardline_Stance We will heed the words of great Winston Churchill. We will never, never,
Never give up. USA will stand. 
Bessie Braddock: "Sir you are drunk."
Churchill: "And you madam are ugly. But in the morning I shall be sober."   Churchill
Lady Astor: Winston,if u were my husband I'd poison ur tea. 

Churchill: If I were ur husband,I'd drink it
@Catalinapby1 Bring back Winnie's bust or bust!
@TANSTAAFL23 my hero
He died in 1965.
What is a record without a record player?
@EWErickson Churchill was a colonizer and racist.
Also a chronic alcoholic who hated himself.
truly a great leader during  most difficult of  times representing a great generation.
"Never, never, never, never give up." #WinstonChurchill
...a great hero & brilliant military leader...a man ordained with others by God to defeat the dark evil of WW II...
@heidiganahl @zstov7 @jxstovik
Amen!! And soo right!
He was the only leader back during WW2 that saw Communisn and Socialism as evil. A true leader
@cc125 Churchill was a great man!
Great leader. Needed one like him today
Perhaps his bust will soon be restored to the white house, where it belongs.
@EWErickson A gold standard 4 Leadership!
"Dangling participles are something up with which I will no longer put."  The man had a sense of humor.
Lest we forget that his Mom / Mum was American. #BrooklynGal
@stepheninthevi True story. My wife has the chair WC sat in at the Fed when he came to meet with FDR during the war
God bless the soul of this great man!
Lets hope he heard that...

@SenTedCruz I sure hope his head goes back into the White House
my fave: If not liberal when you're young, you don't have a heart. If not conservative when old you don't have a brain.
Dunno, sounds kinda like Latimer to Ridley. At the stake.
@SenTedCruz Look at that, a real man leading men. Imagine that....
Huzzah!!
he also caused massive famine deaths in bengal in the 1940's, preventing food from being shipped there to alleviate it
"You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life." Winston Churchill (Great Leader)
obama is evil
"Democracy is the worst form of gov't, except for all the others"
wonder whether Trump will bring back bust of Churchill into Whitehouse that Obama removed?
@SenTedCruz Happy Birthday!
@HeyTammyBruce 
Looking forward to his bust being returned to the Oval Office
A Great Man!
Indeed!
"When you are walking through hell, keep walking", WC, like 8 years of #POTUS Obama! Just saying
che has his stupid face on tons of T shirts- I've yet to see Churchill's... Business idea
@Fahrenthold
In case you were thinking about celebrating Churchill's birthday or quoting him on freedom http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29701767 … 
My dad's favorite historical person ever. He had a Churchill quote for every life lesson he tried to teach us.
I hope he's right...
also Mark Twain and.... Me #1979
@tedcruz The bust will appropriately be back in the Oval Office soon.
@jaketapper "The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." He'd be horrified.
Happy birthday to the eminently quotable Duke of Marlborough. #NeverSurrender
Justice Don, when are you moving over to Gab? I keep looking for you there.
John Lithgow's portrayal of the great leader in The Crown is superb.
Thanks for the reminder. Time for my annual tradition of watching Churchill bio on DVD, He must not be forgotten!
he also ensured millions of death during Britain induced Bengal http://famine.read  @ShashiTharoor new book
@tedcruz @chuckwoolery @GenChuckYeager sounds spot on!
@tedcruz Obama was wrong to remove the tribute of Churchill from the oval office
Group hate doesn't = guilt. Are you all going to keep this up after 1/20?

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-explains-winston-churchills-bust-removed-oval/story?id=38602120 …
I repeat:  it was a mistake for Obama 2 remove the tribute of Churchill. Not sure y that upsets u.
Oh, well that changes everything. 
It changed nothing. Based on our history w Churchill it was a mistake to remove the tribute. Period.
Will be so good to see Churchill back in the White House!
We need to get his bust back in the white house after that bum obama sent it back.  obama couldn't lick his boots
@tedcruz Great quote!
