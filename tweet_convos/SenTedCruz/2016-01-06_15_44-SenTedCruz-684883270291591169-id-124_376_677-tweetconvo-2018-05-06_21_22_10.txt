@SenTedCruz Cruz says 2 his MIDDLE CLASS GOPs " Put us in Office So that WE can take your healthcare AWAY
@SenTedCruz @STOPTHiS  The RINOs better kick it down the street & outta town
@SenTedCruz now we need a president to sign it #cruzmissile2016 :)
@SenTedCruz  I'm still on fence, but isn't this citizenship also like Obama?
@SenTedCruz Cruzer you're a heartless soulless ghoul. WWJD?
@AttilioArmeni @SenTedCruz how so? Keep making people buy unaffordable, unusable insurance or get fined??
@shannonbarker66 @SenTedCruz propose an alternative. Obstructionism is not productive. America needs ideas and solutions. Doing nothing = BS
@SenTedCruz @SpringSteps Everything that is unconstitutional needs to be repealed. It's not going to be easy.
@SenTedCruz I'll share in your praise when they override the veto or cutoff the funding - otherwise it's a meaningless vote.
@SenTedCruz ...only if it's #VetoProof !!!
@SenTedCruz thanks for sharing Senator Ted Cruz, have a great Thursday :) (insight by http://commun.it )
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 it's a rouse for re-election only, nothing can come of it
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 An act of futility, Obama is ready to veto it as soon as it lands on his desk!
@SenTedCruz #TedCruz Will your Healthcare be Repealed?  Why do you #GOP hate Americans that need medical care?
@SoniaPennell @SenTedCruz You'll probably volunteer to help build Cruz's internment camps for gays & lesbians
@SoniaPennell @SenTedCruz Supports Gays and Atheists?  Yes or No?
@SoniaPennell @SenTedCruz I think ALL PEOPLE have the same rights.
@SenTedCruz Will you commit now to repealing Obama's gun control legislation if elected???
@evil_avatar @SenTedCruz    My healthcare premiums went up 50% this year. Ted Cruz please help us.
@SenTedCruz can you sing the Star Spangled Banner?
@SenTedCruz Such a tool. You only know how to tear something down, no ideas on solving anything.
@SenTedCruz leave my healthcare alone.

@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 EFF THIS BAND AID POKITICAL STUNT AFTER THE OMNIBUS!
@SenTedCruz @Callisto1947 Why did you pass the $1.1 Trillion dollar budget if you want to repeal Obamacare and Planned Parenthood?
@SenTedCruz Proud that they voted to take away health coverage from millions of Americans? #pathetic
@SenTedCruz you need mental help
@SenTedCruz To be replaced by...
@SenTedCruz Republicans are proud of their failure.
@SenTedCruz @JoLissa13  bullshit ted, the GOP gave obama every dime he wanted & u belong to the party who did it!  lawyers cant be trusted
@SenTedCruz You mean after you lose the Senate?
@SenTedCruz I guess Ted Cruz will have to go without healthcare since he currently has insurance through ObamaCare...ain't that right Teddy?
@SenTedCruz CONGRESS NEEDS TO SANCTION THE IRAN DEAL AND STOP GUN CONTROL LAW
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 seriously? Why didn't you defund it.
@SenTedCruz This is great news and I want to see you a sign a full repeal of Obamacare as president next year!
@SenTedCruz you aren't even born in this country. You and your party said Obama was not a citizen...so now you aren't a citizen! Hypocrites
@SenTedCruz your alternative?
@SenTedCruz NOT!
You seem like a nice person, @SenTedCruz, but I must go with @realDonaldTrump. https://twitter.com/myGianLuca/status/684803427235311616 … @DEMAGOGSSUCK

     HEADS UP, IOWA!!
 A Cruz Admin Will In Fact
         SHUT DOWN
…
@VickyBrush @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @DEMAGOGSSUCK @petefrt @AppSame Yes, if Trump wasn't in I'd b4 u. U can try 2 out-Trump him though.
@SenTedCruz @peddoc63 Still a show vote. Guys like McCain who like ACA can vote against knowing it will be vetoed
@SenTedCruz I thought I heard you say these are all show votes.  We had the power to defund all of Obamas trash but the debt keeps climbing
@SenTedCruz problem is they already funded ACA and PP through Omnibus
@SenTedCruz This would be great now if the king wouldn't vetto it. Government has no business in health care or forcing it on us
@SenTedCruz maybe if you pray more it will repeal itself...
@SenTedCruz @JadedByPolitics sort of too little too late. Defund was better
@SenTedCruz You're proud of them wasting time on a bill you know will be vetoed?
@SenTedCruz What's your plan for replacing Healthcare for MILLIONS of Americans?  Why do you hate Americans that need medical care?
@YAYASEZ @SenTedCruz what's the assumption they can't get insurance?
@fairtaxman @SenTedCruz DUH - the fact that they couldn't get it before the ACA?
@YAYASEZ @SenTedCruz have you counted the number of people STILL without insurance? ACA not doing what it promised.
@SenTedCruz @rogertvandamme There should be a provision to refund all the IRS penalties taken from those that paid it and refused to comply
@SenTedCruz about time
@SenTedCruz Bullshit, you corrupt cronies already funded Obama for the next year.
@SenTedCruz
I'm looking for you or Mr. Trump to be in office! I love you Both. God Bless you and your Family!
@SenTedCruz you are more loyal to the nra than our children?? WTH?
@SenTedCruz great job. Started off when you left off. Definition of insanity?? This will be 61st try? LOSERS
@SenTedCruz Are we ready for the veto over-ride? Do we have a super-majority?
@RightToTheRight @SenTedCruz GOP won't even have Senate. Defending many more seats than Dems, many in blue blue states.
@SenTedCruz @kinxbitz A fake vote. Republicans can vote to repeal safely because they know it will be vetoed
@SenTedCruz @FiestaBuckeye I guess Ted, but u know well that it's all show for this group. They funded it. Unlike u, they are dishonest
@SenTedCruz so, not even a full week into the new year and already wasting  taxpayer's dollars I see #partyoffiscalresponsibility
@SenTedCruz Can't wait to see the faces of millions of Americans when they watch you take away their health care. Not gonna be pretty!
@SenTedCruz Mr. Cruz - What's your solution for health care?
@SenTedCruz yeah, but won't b votes 2 override veto, so then what? Where's proposal that's veto proof?
@SenTedCruz What are you going to do  it is repealed?  What health insurance will you use?  I understand you are using the ACA.
@SenTedCruz #moron alert  #gop #tcot #pjnet
@SenTedCruz what will you do without your insurance through Obamacare?
@winstoncollege @SenTedCruz uhh, what we did for decades before the ACA?
@SenTedCruz @dennygirltwo I'm for full repeal but the reason GOP has little credibility on this is no public announcement of an alternative.
@SenTedCruz Proud of taking away health insurance of millions of Americans?  YOU SHOULD ALL BE ASHAMED OF YOUR CRAPPY SELFS!
@SenTedCruz where can we find out what's in it? I.e. Read the bill?
@SenTedCruz I want CruzCare!
@Youxia88 @SenTedCruz What is that?
@mitchlreynolds @SenTedCruz It ain't ObamaCare! Choose your own Doctor, cross state lines for insurance, get Care at reasonable price!
@Youxia88 @SenTedCruz So you hate state's rights. Why?
@mitchlreynolds Boy are you stupid. I'm not paying for your free stuff blacky!
@Youxia88 @tedcruz What is stupid is making unfounded assumptions. Again, I ask, why do you hate right of states to regulate industry there?
@SenTedCruz Cruz says" I am entitled 2 Government health care and other Americans Should have NO healthcare"
@SenTedCruz They repealed Obamacare!? Oh wait, no. It's just a waste of time stunt. Relax America.
@SenTedCruz @dixie_pudding when are you guys finally going to impeach obama.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz How about that override? Are you influencing your colleagues?
@SenTedCruz Thanks for spending all that time and taxpayers money on a vendetta.
@SenTedCruz Proud of what? After more than 2000 days of promises and 60 failed attempts, Republicans don't have a replacement plan for ACA.
@SenTedCruz you need to get lost. What an embarrassment to our state.
@SenTedCruz #TeamRubio @marcorubio #Omnibus success! Remember who did this when it's ultimately defunded!
@SenTedCruz @MenesesRudy Save the theater. Worthless GOPe could have not funded it. Instead meaningless gesture that will Veto. Stuff it.
@SenTedCruz being the devout Christian that you are I'm sure you have a plan to help the poor afford healthcare.
@SenTedCruz
@SenTedCruz This is a phony vote bill cant get passed.Ryan knows it, gave away the farm. Not stupid enough to not see through this BS.
@SenTedCruz Are you really that clueless? That was Ryan's price for passing the budget! Later he gets to repeal ACA so O can veto it? Dummy
@Anumbr1 @SenTedCruz 
Wait.  If O was gonna veto anyway then why the anger at Ryan? What, shut down govt?
@TimSigmund @SenTedCruz Cruz wanted govt shut down again if PP was funded, Ryan passed budget & now Dems let him pass repeal 4 veto. Futile.
@SenTedCruz I ment the repeal of this extortion of the American public.
@SenTedCruz Thank Senator Cruz for whatever hand you may have had in this extortion by the current administration. The man is a crook!
@SusanRothenberg @SenTedCruz 
You're kidding right? #FreeMarkets #tortreform
@SenTedCruz ANOTHER WASTE OF TIME AND TAXPAYERS MONEY 
WHAT A STUPIDITY OF REPUBLICANS
@SenTedCruz STOP him. He is spreading the Constitution and an illegal act of ObamaCare. Can't call it Affordable as it isn't even close.
@SenTedCruz that ain't going to happen.. crazy like your father..
@SenTedCruz You're proud to pass a bill that has no chance of getting signed? The Rs & Ds, spending our money on nothing....
@SenTedCruz Wasting our tax $ repealing signature law of a twice popularly elected pres. knowing he will veto is working against The People.
@SenTedCruz ...if you become POTUS I hope you keep your word or at least try your best too.
@SenTedCruz let's make it stick!
@SenTedCruz That's a good one. Tell me about the sky falling again...
@SenTedCruz the ACA is crap written like the Stimulus theft! Pelosi's liar Grouber! STIMULUS! $853B 600M to Cali  fishing! Pelosi owns 40%
@SenTedCruz it will be vetoed. We all know that. Just political fodder for the Nov 4th fire, Mr. Cruz.
@im_ulysses @SenTedCruz 
This will be repealed at a later date thanks to Rubio, believe it or not.  This sends a message.  #notashowvote
@TimSigmund @SenTedCruz Rubio oh Rubio, where for art thy Conservative values and principles? They dost lay in the dust of thy campaign.
@SenTedCruz Obamacare repeal vote useless after omnibus.
@SenTedCruz Thank Gd you are doin God's work- using our tax dollars to ram your head into a wall to take away poor peoples health coverage!
@SenTedCruz thanks for the tweet.
@SenTedCruz They should have made this part of the budget deal. Doing it like this gives ya'll ZERO leverage over a veto. Stupid move.
@SenTedCruz pointless, the GOP is dead.
@SenTedCruz Just like your campaign. Failure !
@SenTedCruz As we all know, this does nothing unless Hillary is defeated. At least it shows backbone, though.
@SenTedCruz cc: @daveweigel
.@SenTedCruz Waste of time and money. I can't fathom how, after 60 previous times, you think 61st time is helping this country. Failure.
@SenTedCruz: Well, just be prepared for the uproar repeal will cause.
@SenTedCruz me too.
@SenTedCruz another ass proud to strip health care for millions and revert to a system that was bankrupting families
@SenTedCruz Now, keep the ball rolling.
@SenTedCruz please get it gone!!!!!!!
