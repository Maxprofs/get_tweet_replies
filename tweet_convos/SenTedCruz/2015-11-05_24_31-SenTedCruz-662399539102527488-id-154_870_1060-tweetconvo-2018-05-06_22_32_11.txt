@seanhannity @tedcruz Does Dirty Harry hate America? GET IT PASSED!
@seanhannity @tedcruz I like Cruz Harry Reid should be charged as an accomplice for protecting these criminals
@seanhannity @BraveLad It is complete Dem BS propaganda that illegal immigrants should be lumped up w/ legal immigrants! #StopHillary
@seanhannity @tedcruz Cruz is awesome. Reis is a moron. Apparently he cares not about safety of American families, only illegal families.
@seanhannity he is only defending all the immigration that is taking the road through naturalization, like my girlfriend and many others
@seanhannity @FAMDOC7 Harry Reid is a stain on the United States Senate.
@seanhannity love Cruz. . . he'll make a great Vice President for Trump
@cjostrowski how about this . . . Christie for Attorney General and Carson as Surgeon General!!
@seanhannity @FoxNews 
The sooner #Reid gets out the better for America he and his best friend #Nancy Pelosi are #Obama Ass Kissers #Get Out
@seanhannity @BraveLad Reid needs to go lay down somewhere, smells like he died a week ago
@seanhannity @tedcruz
@seanhannity This is what I want to hear from my president. #Cruz2016
@seanhannity @tedcruz he is great, love tedcruz

“@seanhannity: Watch: Senator Ted Cruz Destroys Harry Reid Over Opposition To Kate's Law  http://www.hannity.com/articles/hanpr-immigration-487258/watch-senator-ted-cruz-destroys-harry-14099691/#ixzz3qeQlJxPW …” #CruzCrew #mepolitics
@seanhannity @tedcruz made Reid look like the dirt bag he is - would make a great president.
@seanhannity Wake up America and listen to @tedcruz wisdom about Kate's Law. It defies logic that anyone would vote against it.
@seanhannity besides. does this daddy-issue bearing fool ever "destroy" anything other than his credibility simply by existing?
cc:@tedcruz
@seanhannity there's gotta be another verb out there in the universe you can where out other than 'destroy' eh Sean? LOL
cc:@tedcruz
@seanhannity @tedcruz I'm so used to watching Harry Reid bury himself, it's refreshing to see someone else do it for a change :)
@seanhannity @tedcruz I dont understand how sanctuary cities even became but they need to disolve. Why are we giving illegal aliens rufuge.
@seanhannity @tedcruz How do U allow a crazy, senile man to hold us back from Kate's Law.Have him checked by psychiatristGet a court order!
@seanhannity @tedcruz are silent on #Speaker calling for a vote 9/11 1st responders Heath bill & fully funding #clayhuntact @PaulRieckhoff
@seanhannity @tedcruz A good man, Ted Cruz.
.@seanhannity Cruz destroys liberals regularly yet you support Trump who spends all his time attacking republicans.
@Con_Metal_Fan he is a total sellout fuck him his show his website and his network. HANNIDERP DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ME!
@hyperion5182 It's disgusting how so many people I use to respect have been so completely duped by an asshole like Trump.
@seanhannity @pricklypear12 Harry Reid is truly evil
@seanhannity ITS ALWAYS HARD TO STAND ALONE BUT ITS A HELL OF ALOT EASIER WHEN YOU ARE AS SMART & ELOQUENT AS @tedcruz
@seanhannity @freedomtex Anybody who shows Reid for what he is deserves an American hero award.
@seanhannity @freedomtex You cant get through to a villain.  Harry Reid is a villian and unredeemable.
@seanhannity @tedcruz is right! Reid and his cronies DO align with the criminals. They are thugs, liars, cheats and downright self-serving!
@seanhannity @tedcruz Reid makes me so furious, I wanna punch out his other eye! Ted, as always, is a champion, uses words likes bullets!
@seanhannity @tedcruz   Please Talk about Electoral vote so voters know how that effects the election. America needs informed on this
@seanhannity @tedcruz Cruz couldn't destroy a pie let alone another human in a debate.
@seanhannity @tedcruz That's nice, but let me know how many illegal aliens Ted promises to deport, will ya? We have 30 MILLION!
@seanhannity what are you smoking? Destroy?!? HAHA.  I'm sure @tedcruz dad came here "legally" like all other Cubans during that time...
@seanhannity @tedcruz 

What is this Dufus from an insignificant state like Nevada  doing dictating what we the people get and can do....?
@seanhannity @tedcruz Ted Cruz is our only hope! Period!
@seanhannity What a outstanding performance by Sen.Ted Cruz! #Right #On #Ted, #Right #On!!
@seanhannity @tedcruz #CruzCrew
We dont need another feel good law

@seanhannity @tedcruz
@seanhannity Notice how @tedcruz routinely omits the stop his father made in Canada, which is odd since the Senator was born there? Hmmm.
@seanhannity @bigredmatt1011 He is the most qualified guy running for President.
@seanhannity @1_Hoof_Hearted Cruz tells it like it is & leaves the vote decisions to us while democrats buy your votes and spread deceit
@seanhannity Ted Cruz sure is no fan of democracy.
@seanhannity Since when does the minority over rule the majority?
@calaiscl200 @seanhannity @rtoberl @BettyBoopDooper @dallas_413 @bullcook11 @GretchenInOK That's not fair to scum!! :))
@g_makay @seanhannity @rtoberl @BettyBoopDooper @dallas_413 @bullcook11 @GretchenInOK  What was I thinking?
@calaiscl200 @seanhannity @rtoberl @BettyBoopDooper @dallas_413 @bullcook11 @GretchenInOK Or were you?? Tee-hee!!
@seanhannity @CITIncUS   that old pussy was destroyed when he was born.
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz Ty Sean for a great show especially pleased with Ted Cruz ripping apart Harry Reid re Kate's Law.
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz  I stated previously why would anyone oppose KATE LAW. If Reed had member of family killed would he change his mind
@seanhannity @tedcruz @HarryReid  Harry has proven is Money , Greed and too much Power dose to one Person !
@seanhannity
@seanhannity
@seanhannity

@seanhannity @JHWalz32 NO CRUZ
@seanhannity one day someone will say Harry Reid is what is wrong with Hell.
@seanhannity 
#Cruz defends unconstitutional re-distribution of fedtaxs to States and cities.
Watch what they do...
@seanhannity #HarryReid #WTF he's still around~ He should be rocking on the porch at #APlaceForMom giving directions to the visitors center
@seanhannity Yes. Good job Senator Cruz. Thank you.
Hey @SenatorReid, the next POTUS had a message for you & @SenateDems for your opposition to #KatesLaw @seanhannity
@seanhannity @lance4usa Another velvet avalanche of truth from @tedcruz.
@seanhannity And no one give a crap what Canadian Cruz has to say. @tedcruz #SendCruzback
@seanhannity @lance4usa
If MSM did its job, filthy Harry would've  been in Leavenworth long ago
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz   explain how this can happen theat Harry Reid controls the Senate? #defundGOP #KatesLaw
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz Harry Reid: the most miserable form of fossil to ever contaminate the floor of the Senate. toss his bony ass out.
@seanhannity "Sean, Harry Reid is low hanging fruit because he's a ..."
@Doc_JJK @seanhannity very nutty, needs therapy
@seanhannity Gotta love Cruz!!
@seanhannity Sean: Republicans have something that Dems don't. Minorities
@seanhannity Sean: The Republicans debates have something that Dems Don't http://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/11/04/men-magic-president-obama-donald-trump/ …  Minorities
@RADIOTALK101 @seanhannity who is president again?
@seanhannity Grandstanding again. Cruz cannot get anything passed. Does not build coalitions like @realDonaldTrump can do. We need action.
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz those on the left oppose this Bill for same reason they oppose Voting ID. They lose if Illegals can't vote!
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz HARRY REID NEEDS TO RESIGN
@seanhannity Re; "Kate's Law"; those on the left oppose this Bill for same reason they oppose Voting ID They lose if Illegals can't vote!
@seanhannity very well put Ted Cruz
@seanhannity WHY IS THE NEWS MEDIA CONFLATING ILLEGAL ALIENS WITH IMMIGRANTS.THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. ARE THEY STUPID OR LYING.
VOTE TRUMP
@seanhannity so many people ; Republicans included say they would NEVER vote for him keep up the good work
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz Harry Reid is a disgrace to our country, senate and to our people. I will be so happy to see this old snob leave.

@seanhannity The Brilliance of Senator Ted Cruz - The Democratic Party exsist by contradictions - law breaking-immoral Anti-Constutionalist
@seanhannity I didn't hear that. Was it good?  That would really make my day. Thank you Ted Cruz. Crush that little bug Harry Reid. 
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz Going with Hugh Hewitt advice for Clinton: If you have to debate @SenTedCruz just don't show up  #tcot
@seanhannity Ted Cruz is a good solid man,Harry Reid he ain't much!
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz Some one needs to finish putting that old fool in a nursing home. Maybe, that treadmill will crank up again. LOL
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz I can't wait until Hillary gets asked about Kate's Law in tomorrow's debate. And then they'll ask about Houston law
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz The only thing Ted Cruz destroys is a five dollar foot long.
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz you go Ted Cruz. Harry Reid needs to go, he is awful
@seanhannity @SenTedCruz Dying is just the hand of the free market clearing up warehouse space. #LaissezFaire

@MiceeMouse @marylene58 @seanhannity
@seanhannity So you have nothing to say about G.I. Joe cop that killed himself, had plenty of things to say before like BLM and Obama did it
@seanhannity Harry Reid needs to be psychologically evaluated! He is very bothersome to our country!
@seanhannity this shows that dems value illegals more than US citizens.
@seanhannity Good for you Senator Cruz.  Well said.
@pwdrhounder @seanhannity LMAO,He Couldn't do his job as a Senator,No showfor Votes for the American people,He's a Scripted Scumbag attorney

@seanhannity  This man scares the hell out of Dems & RINOs alike more & more each day.  Doing exactly what he said he'd do.
@seanhannity I'm not aware of Cruz ever destroying anything, he talks, but let's get past the showmanship and see what happens to the bill.

@seanhannity Hey Hannity now that Biden isn't running,how much you want to bet Obama will vote for Carson because he is black?Fair question
@seanhannity believe me there isn't any love lost between Hillary Clinton and Obama.Deep down they don't like each other.
@Viper1600 @seanhannity but both are despicable
@seanhannity I think the only thing @tedcruz destroys are Simpsons impersonations
@jlpark18 @seanhannity @tedcruz How can anyone be against Kate's Law.
@seanhannity we thought us conservatives didn't believe in new laws just enforce existing laws?
