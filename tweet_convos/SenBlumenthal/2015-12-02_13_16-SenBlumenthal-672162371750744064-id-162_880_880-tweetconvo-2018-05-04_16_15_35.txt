@SenBlumenthal @TNsWesBoling And what action would have prevented this one?
@bill_mynatt @SenBlumenthal The same passion for curbing gun violence that we have for fighting terrorism.
@TNsWesBoling @SenBlumenthal I understand, but that doesn't answer the question. What legislation would have prevented today's incident?
@bill_mynatt For starters, an assault weapons ban. In many ways, the toothpaste is out of the tube. But that doesn't excuse inaction.
@TNsWesBoling Do you know that the weapons used today were bought legally? Were they stolen? Were they smuggled over the boarder?
@bill_mynatt Feel free to have the last word. I like and respect you and we'll just disagree on this one.
@TNsWesBoling @bill_mynatt he never actually answered your questions he just tried to sound like he had the moral high ground #democrats
@HLow29 @bill_mynatt I'm conservative. I'm just part of the majority that wants better legislation.
@SenBlumenthal maybe if people in the building had guns they could have stopped the guys? But no just blame all gun owners
@HLow29 this more gun theory stops crime is ludicrous
@HLow29 check out the crime rate in countries that have less guns. You will answer your own question. USA is not safe with all these guns.
@u233tech pretty sure the UK has the highest crime rate in the world and they have no guns
@HLow29 crime rate and gun violence are two separate things, pretty sure is no one to prove a point.
@u233tech when I measure guns effect on crime I don't count school truancy, domestic violence, disorderly conduct an other unrelated things
@HLow29 here you go, check out Wikipedia List of countries by firearm-related death rate. The Internet is for full of useful things.
@u233tech you know that includes killed by police, criminals killed by lawful gun owners, and most of that is in gun free liberal cities
@SenBlumenthal Every illegal alien that commits crimes against citizens, is YOUR FAULT and you don't have to violate our rights to fix
@SenBlumenthal @owillis only helps bad people commit serious crimes. You dont see these people running into the local PD for a shootout
@SenBlumenthal pls Senator Blumenthal respect your own office and its prerogatives defined under the Constitution.
@SenBlumenthal @owillis congress does need action, but if a few more bans is sum1 solution & no real $ is put up then clearly THEY DONT CARE
@SenBlumenthal @CGasparino The bad guys will always find a way to hurt others.
@SenBlumenthal So Senator how about supporting mandatory 10 year federal sentence for possessing a gun during a crime? Thought not.
@SenBlumenthal How stupid is it to say people are fleeing crime and violence, them leave border open for crime and violence to walk in
@SenBlumenthal By all means but first some border and criminal control. You know, something that would actually work
@SenBlumenthal Then I guess you are complicit in driving out GE from CT for your support of confiscatory taxes. Sen Stolen Valor.
@SenBlumenthal You should resign in protest in that case.
@SenBlumenthal Bill Clinton let Atta in the country on expired Visa, thousands died due to border control failure not gun laws @DLoesch
@SenBlumenthal 32,719 people died in traffic crashes. The Obama admin is effectively complicit for its inaction.

Just as stupid.
@SenBlumenthal Congress is complicit in allowing terrorists into the country, but Obama is the guy holding the door open for them
@SenBlumenthal Largest attack on innocence that killed 2000 people didn't include any guns; did include gov border control failure @DLoesch
@SenBlumenthal 2/3 suicides. Being loose w the facts doesn't bode well for your argument sir
@SenBlumenthal Nothing makes me want to do something MORE than government trying to police me when I've committed no crime! Nanny State BS
@SenBlumenthal Please convince your Dem comrades to make sweeping gun control their priority during the upcoming election.
@SenBlumenthal @CGasparino 
Please describe how controlling guns of law abiding citizens will stop criminals and terrorists from using guns!
@SenBlumenthal   We need much tighter gun control in this country especially concerning the sale of military type automatic weapons!
@SenBlumenthal @owillis Lets be clear that CT did almost nothing to INCREASE safety at soft targets & only slightly better w/mental health
@SenBlumenthal So this women wouldn't have killed anyone but for a gun? Idiot. What about her bombs?
@SenBlumenthal is that the same kind of inaction you did during the Vietnam war? #stolenvalor
@SenBlumenthal @CGasparino You would know something about weapons if you had been in the military instead of lying about being in military.
@SenBlumenthal 
If you take away guns, you will be responsible for treason. A future responsible government will punish that accordingly.
@senblumenthal @cgasparino Aren't you the one who lied about Viet Nam service?
@SenBlumenthal you should stop letting suicidal people buy guns, bro.  Maybe that would help.
@SenBlumenthal maybe if you would work on reducing the suicide rate you could cut that number by roughly 70% #2A
@SenBlumenthal @bannerite Even if the #SanBernadinoShooting was terrorism isn't that even more of a reason for better gun control?
@SenBlumenthal @COCeasefire
@SenBlumenthal California has all the ridiculous laws you propose. THEY DIDNT WORK. They never do. Criminals don't give a shit about the law
@SenBlumenthal Trample the rights of the law abiding because of evil actions of lunatics? That's your solution?
@SenBlumenthal Glad to see your press conference today on gun control.
@SenBlumenthal what? We complicit???? put your liberal shawl away, please Mr. Blumenthal, and think like a rational American.
@SenBlumenthal  100 million who never got a life due2abortions by selfish women &confiscating guns?still had killings in France
@SenBlumenthal Ohhhh what an "intellectual post"...Are you also for Pipe Bomb control because they had dozens of them?
@SenBlumenthal Blah blah blah
@SenBlumenthal how about banning utensils and tools since they can be used to kill someone. How about the buying of illegal weapons? Think
@SenBlumenthal yeah maybe they should look into banning vehicles and alcohol since drunk driving is a part of those 30,000 tragic deaths
@SenBlumenthal Government hand-wringing, posturing & debate will not save the next lives lost from another mass shooting. Act now.
@SenBlumenthal Take the first step today & honor life! Vote to defund PP. Women & our country deserve better #cultureoflife #AllLivesMatter
.@SenBlumenthal I am a legal gun owner, I have NO tactical gear, NO assault weapons, nor is my home an IED FACTORY. Stop lying>>>TERRORISM
@Chloecat317 @SenBlumenthal Ricky, 100,000 suicides a year, 20,000 used a gun, that leaves 10,000 HOMICIDES and that includes self defense
@SenBlumenthal Remember that majority you guys had all those years ago and all you passed was Healthcare reform? Good times huh?
@SenBlumenthal Wait r u not in Congress?
@SenBlumenthal But, wait: don't you represent CT? Is that a It Couldn't Happen In CT remark? How effective is your record, Richard?
@SenBlumenthal yes, please stop Islamic terrorism
@SenBlumenthal Please take a leadership role to stop the complicity and #stopgunviolence. Thank you.

@SenBlumenthal @troycorley 
I blame corrupt corporate media for inciting hate and devision, NOT our Bill of Rights.
@LibertyIsALady @SenBlumenthal  The Congress is complicit for not taking action to control weapons of mass destruction.
@troycorley @SenBlumenthal 
We export most the world's war weaponry.
@SenBlumenthal @TheRealAnaOrtiz TOTALY! And they're getting BLOOD MONEY for their financial association with the NRA who make money from Gs
@SenBlumenthal @prairielive They should be sued for their complicity!
@PoliticallyLib @SenBlumenthal Agree totally.
@SenBlumenthal @DrJudyStone Ya think so?
.@SenBlumenthal I see the neurosyphilis has completely replaced your brain tissue, you hack.
@SenBlumenthal @thesilverspiral you can not control the actions of others. Punishing those who are just & right solves nothings.
@SenBlumenthal your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/02/the-new-york-daily-newss-very-provocative-front-page-on-the-san-bernardino-shooting/ …
@SenBlumenthal fire staffer who posts or slow down a tick. leaders all know 1st info is always wrong. Develop SITTEP 1st to see what deal is
@SenBlumenthal
@SenBlumenthal @DavidPoland maybe it's a Hundredth Monkey scenario.......
@SenBlumenthal THANK YOU, SENATOR. You speak for so many here in CT & around the US. Your voice is important in this battle--Keep Fighting!
Once again @SenBlumenthal uses a tragedy to push his misguided agenda on the law abiding citizens of this great nation. Shameful.
@SenBlumenthal stop being the ct attorney general and start being a us senator who represents all of ct not just the left loons
@SenBlumenthal @NBCConnecticut I reiterate, Senator - When will you resign as a consequence of your inaction as part of Congress?
@SenBlumenthal @nsw43 And MSM are gutless to remain silent and not report all 30K gun deaths & Congressional inaction, r in cahoots.
@SenBlumenthal @NBCConnecticut the culture has to change; not just legislation. #responsibility
@SenBlumenthal @NBCConnecticut cant wait to get these guys out of office. gun control doesnt stop acts of violence. just hurts the good guy
@SenBlumenthal you said it
@SenBlumenthal California has virtually every gun law imaginable.  Which new one are you suggesting?  Be specific.
@SenBlumenthal @kharyp How dare Paul Ryan conduct a moment of silence for these victims. He has blood on his hands, wants to pray for them?
@SenBlumenthal  "you just don't get it" No laws passed will ever keep guns out of the hands of criminals - criminals obey no laws!
@SenBlumenthal San Bernardino is a terror attack you nit wit?
@SenBlumenthal I agree.
@SenBlumenthal Alright, and what the hell have you done to change it?  pointing fingers is no better than pointing a gun - not a solution
@SenBlumenthal Every Congressperson and Senator accepting money from the NRA and the rest of the (cont) http://tl.gd/nlfauq 
@SenBlumenthal @shannonrwatts is addressed, the violence. What do you all not understand? The UK is now discussing knife control. WTF??????
@SenBlumenthal @shannonrwatts This is just more proof that strict gun laws DO NOT WORK! This will gontinue yo happen until the REAL issue
@SenBlumenthal @shannonrwatts Blood is on their hands.
@SenBlumenthal    That is BS and you know it.  Just more leftist anti-Constitutional baloney.
@SenBlumenthal The people feel it's them against Washington! They need TRUMP NOW or they might start a civil war! TRUMP NOT GOP
@SenBlumenthal Trump is the ONLY 1 who says buildings need security or armed guards for protection. The people need TRUMP NOW!
@SenBlumenthal Yes why won't Congress make shooting people illegal?
@SenBlumenthal @CAPgunsandcrime They're busy. Those 61 attempts to defund the ACA aren't going to run themselves.
@SenBlumenthal So someone who is willing to face the consequences of committing murder, which I think is also a law, will obey gun laws?
@SenBlumenthal Don't know what the Senator's proposed solution is, but this is at least the right mindset.
@SenBlumenthal @TheRealAnaOrtiz Tragic
@SenBlumenthal yes you are, please resign
@senblumenthal @officialkat enough already...or fire Congress
@SenBlumenthal Sure, you can give up your guns anytime. Enjoy being a victim.
@SenBlumenthal So you think criminals and mass murderers are waiting for a bill, are you serious? #every2ndmatters
@SenBlumenthal  #SanBernardino Prayers for the victims. Many in the world can't understand why America is so virtually clueless with guns.
@SenBlumenthal And what exactly is Congress to do when the vast majority of these atrocities are committed with ILLEGALLY obtained weapons?
@bamajessiej @SenBlumenthal Actually, most of the mass murderers guns are LEGALLY obtained.
@SpartanTango @SenBlumenthal I would check that information.
@bamajessiej @SenBlumenthal Yes.  You should.
@SenBlumenthal What about the mayor & other leaders in Chicago they are all democrats and what do they do about the daily shootings there?
@SenBlumenthal You don't even know what happened, yet you are blaming Congress( aka GOP). Why don't you wait to LEARN the facts first?
@SenBlumenthal @OfficialKat what about all the deaths related to medical malpractice?
@SenBlumenthal @OfficialKat people still live in san bernardino?
@SenBlumenthal @owillis Im not a gun nut, i dont need one behind every blade of grass BS, but I also think just Banning guns everywhere
@SenBlumenthal @owillis NO ONE is willing to pay for peoples actual security, and to act like new CT laws make a diff. they dont
@SenBlumenthal.  Congress is complicit in what way....and for what inaction?  Please elaborate.
@SenBlumenthal @OfficialKat When they show up in body armour and masks, they are NOT "some kind of a nut job with a gun".  This was planned.
@SenBlumenthal @OfficialKat This is silly. Please indicate which laws would have prevented which/each of those deaths.
.@SenBlumenthal @jamiekilstein Not just effectively complicit. Congress, and some members way more than others, have hands covered in blood.
@SenBlumenthal @zoeinthecities So true. Reminds me of the phrase...Evil flourishes when good men do nothing.
Really...@SenBlumenthal  How is Congress complicit? #MoronAlert
@SenBlumenthal so do something.
@SenBlumenthal You are complicit in the murder of 500,000 people per year. You stand with planned murders.If you want to save lives stop pp.
@SenBlumenthal @CTDems In such a sin a person has a chance to do what is good but he willfully avoids.
@SenBlumenthal @jfagone Hi Senator! You know how to amend the Constitution right? They probably taught you that in Senator School. Do it!
@SenBlumenthal bravo. Now let's act.
@SenBlumenthal What are you doing about it???????  Why are you on Twitter?????  Go save lives!!!!!!!!
@SenBlumenthal @LibtardLimbaugh If you use "inaction" as the rationale, Congress could be indicted for every problem in the country.
@SenBlumenthal Typical Blumenthal,speak first,get facts later!Disgrace!
@SenBlumenthal I've been saying that for ages! They have blood on their hands
@SenBlumenthal what are you doing to stop this epidemic, Senator?
@SenBlumenthal Considering what the state has been known to do to its ppl to maintain order & control; we cannot COMPLETELY disarm CITIZENS.
@SenBlumenthal By that logis, they would also be complicit for the 32,000 + car deaths that will happen this year as well!
There is No Excuse for this. We have to Do Something. NOW. 
#gunregulation
#gunsense @SenBlumenthal
@SenBlumenthal The 2nd Amnd. is a Double Edged Blade; it puts defense AND aggression in the hands of the people; rather then just w/ state.
@SenBlumenthal complicit in what? We don't even know what happened yet.
@SenBlumenthal I agree arm everyone
@SenBlumenthal @CTDems there is also something called as sin of inaction and apathy.
@SenBlumenthal pretty much the only thing they are effective at
@SenBlumenthal What a disgrace you are to politicize this tragedy, much less on the same day and with no facts available. #politicalhack
@SenBlumenthal never let a crisis go to waste! #stfu
Yes MT @SenBlumenthal: In 30,000 tragic deaths every year — & now #SanBernardino — Congress is effectively complicit for its inaction
@speechboy71 @xpostfactoid1 @SenBlumenthal Our default assumption should be "Congress is complicit for its inaction" until proven otherwise.
@SenBlumenthal - when unarmed people are shot by terrorists/criminals the solution is not to require people be unarmed.
@SenBlumenthal You're a good guy, keep up the good work -   listen to live police radio in #sanbernardino active http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/13038/web …
@klangfarbian @senblumenthal Hate to burst your refugee hate-bubble, but it already *is* happening every day… http://theslot.jezebel.com/there-have-been-more-mass-shootings-in-2015-than-days-i-1745776127 …
@SenBlumenthal Senator, you can't shame people who don't know what that is.
@SenBlumenthal Will you stop! By all accounts this smacks of terrorism...your meme of more gun control is not the answer.
@NJCJR1979 Oh. So they DIDN'T use guns? Now I'm confused.
@brewfangrb Ahh the village idiot speaks ...now take your Soma
@SenBlumenthal When will something be done?
@asterixaverni @SenBlumenthal lol that's easy.. when every gop is removed from office.. including from scotus
