Puerto Ricans are AMERICANS, Mr. President. We don’t head for the exits when our fellow citizens are dying.
Congress must provide aid for the millions of Puerto Rican people Trump seems intent on leaving behind.
Abandoning Puerto Rico now by withdrawing FEMA would be a betrayal of fellow Americans.
I saw a Puerto Rico struggling w devastation&death in dire need of FEMA, military&federal relief. Mr. President, it's a humanitarian crisis.
Trump's threats to cease active aid for Puerto Rico reflect a double standard of disaster relief. America is about to fail fellow Americans.
When did money become people.
He is just stating facts as they exist. Never said MISSION ABANDONED. Get your information correct
Blumenthal falsely claims to be Vietnam veteran, still gets elected!
This is now up to the Senate and Congress to Support Puerto Rico and to take this maniac out of the White House.  Impeach him now!
Lock him up!  Trump’s a murderer of his own people!
they are not a state but want all the rights of a state, how does that work?
Maybe the last box delivered should be a gross of pacifiers to the Mayor of San Juan.
MY taxes are paying for Fema/military/firstresponders, I would home they get their job done and get out. #stopwhining
Talk to anyone from Puerto Rico!  They claim there Puerto Rican until they need help!
Unfortunately 45 is a narcissist Who only cares about himself. Please, please, please help our fellow Americans

#ImpeachTrumpNow
Thats YOUR job as a senator.  Do your job or leave office!
The financial stuff he is talking about was there before the hurricane  Someone had their hand in the cookie jar.  Why do you democrats lie?
No, you have applied your own meaning to exactly what is written.   The president is surfacing an issue which must be addressed.
trump is mortally callous hipocrate, he doesn’t care for PR one iota
what is Congress doing???
Can you plaese challenge the president to say the 50 states alphabetically. And sing the anthem i bet he dont know any.He our leader
Odd I didn't see anything in there that mentioned "abandonment". Do you work CNN or NBC?
a very enlightening read. remind you of anyone in Washington?
@Cynthia78939112 He also hasn't signed Russia Sanction Bill. This is Fascism!Senate stop trying to be politically correct!
He signed  just has not implemented
Yes Julie. My mistake I should have said that. Too me when he does that same thing lol
Thank you senator, now PLEASE stop this monster! He's a danger to Americans on so many levels, not enough characters to list them all
This is genocide. History will not be kind to trumps enablers and handlers.
We should bail on that hell hole, rape filled island once and for all. It’s time to de-annex #PuertoRico
You are a person who can do something about it. The Senate and Congress can remove him. Do it now.
Losers always quit. Losers never win.
Nicely turned your way.  Guess truth isn’t a priority to you.
Please do something about him! Or tell us what, if anything, we can do! Puerto Rico is dying!!!
Awhile passing the buck
THIS behaviour/attitude from 45 is a CONTINUING CRIMINAL ABOMINATION! 25th Amendmt. pls. Mueller coming too late 2 save from nuke winter!!
he just sees it as a non-profitable business entity.  Dude, you cant chapter 11 your way out of PR
Congress RISKED JUST AS MANY LIVES HERE by not passing HC? How many VETS suffered BEFORE TRUMP STEPPED UP? YOU ALL headed for the EXISTS!
This man and his fellow vets are Angels!  https://www.facebook.com/jason.maddy.7/videos/1639085836163967/ … https://www.facebook.com/jason.maddy.7/videos/1639077166164834/ …  Please support: https://www.facebook.com/jason.maddy.7/posts/1639191129486771 …
He declared it "Mission Abandoned"???   Did he pull everyone out?
How Do u fix Ur mouth to call your self American u were never supposed to be president u will go down in history as a murder of americans
But Richard they are not quite white are they? Trump really is a white supremacist
Please do what you can to protect true American values. We are better than this man.
But it's OK for him to play golf on the weekends and use text payer money for Secret Service that's OK though
There has to be some fiscal contributions from PR too. It is a humanitarian crisis, no doubt, but not sure it is entirely up to US to repair
More partisan lies.  That is clearly not what he said.  CT derserves better in its senators.
#45 the devil has not built the hell your going to you will bust hell wide open
Your a new fool ur signing a executive order to dismantle OBAMACARE god said he takes care of babies and fools
Why aren't you in #PuertoRico volunteering your help? Shame on you!!!
A TRUE AMERICAN is the IDIOT fake potus45 !  If it doesn't benefit me, my family and my nitwit supporters FUCKEM, they're on their own!
Please.  You HAVE to get rid of this guy before he kills more of us.
He'll cut aid AND he's let the restrictive Jones Act to go back in place--so other countries can't help. He's clearly punishing US citizens.
Senator America begs you- do all you can to get the inept dangerous POTUS out of office! People are suffering!!!!
What does it take for impeachment @SenBlumenthal? This president is reckless and dangerous-costing lives of Americans! I'm so concerned!
POTUS on full display again. Shameful. Impeach and convict them all.
Trump has a way of inflicting the most pain here.
Taking help from those people u should be charged with mass murder and the gop u are helping him THEY ARE AMERICANS this is murder
Come Rich,,, we know your distain for the POTUS but he. Ever said he was going to abandon them..
Ur fighting the damn NFL over the flag but it is ur duty as a horrible president to help Puerto Rico
@SenBlumenthal It’s time to stand with @RepMaxineWaters and call for his impeachment!
Impeach- dereliction of duty: that is what the past 9mo have been.  It will be a stain on America
Trump is now a genocidal maniac!! What more does Congress need to impose the 25th???

That SOB needs to be #Impeached ASAP
What is CONGRESS, CO-EQUAL branch of government going to do about it? Can’t congress take action to protect & support Puerto Rico.
Can we slso focus on the PHARMACEUTICAL companies that manufacture in PR that are NOT PAYING TAXES to build the infrastructure!!!
This govt. has to help its people.Disasters in PR,US V.I.'s, Cal.CHIP expired.No regard for 4 souldiers  killed in Niger.Mitch & Paul SUCK!
Will someone please tell that man who is the president this not his money this tax payer money so you need to keep right on helping Puerto .
How many states run same way w/debt, poor infrastructure  &power grids? DT shld lead & find solution to help modernize-wasn’t it a pledge?
He's despicable beyond words. Lock him up
This is genocide. Period! Trump must be REMOVED from office via 25th amendment or impeachment on emergency basis! What's holding this up?
Exactly
You are expecting miracles if you think he is capable of caring about anyone.Republicans must be convinced to impeach.
OMG, a new idea - get a plan going instead of throwing money at the feet of CORRUPT politicians- you know- how they got into this trouble.
quit twisting everything to fit your narrative.,we'll be there, you people are useless.as bad as nbc news.
Wow.  Such a lie.  The onus is on Congress to fund FEMA and on Puerto Rico to get the work done.
thanks for fighting the good fight for us. I hate waiting but I hope 2018 will usher in more dems to Congress as well as results by Mueller
Yessss my sister yes hope and pray if they do he will be gone
I think they should drug test @realDonaldTrump. Like seriously, this man is not all there...
Will Congress let hundreds more American taxpayers die just to prove how incompetent our POTUS is?
#ImpeachTrumpNow
One word: disgraceful.
Hurtful but not surprising that @realDonaldTrump would abandon US citizens in an area he probably didn't know existed until a month ago

There was another Hurricane? How did the situation get worse?
No one believes a word you say other then stupid liberals......dude we can't just spend tons of cash to PR ! Liberals will just steal it !
DO SOMETHING! we gave you that power. This is genocide
The @UN needs to intervene - a crime against humanity.
He is pathetic!!
He is unfit #ImpeachTrumpNow
Has he done the same for Texas and Florida? 
WHY WHY WHY can't  our government do anything to get him out of office? Dereliction of duty, no? Or Article 25, he's insane!
