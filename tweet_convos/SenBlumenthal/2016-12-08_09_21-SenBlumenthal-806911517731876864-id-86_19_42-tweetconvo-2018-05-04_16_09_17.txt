.@SenBlumenthal that's odd*, considering I've been using #ecigs for almost three years, and I'm still alive & healthy. 

*a bold-faced LIE
it is not a lie. You need to dive into the research.
.@dshepherd62 @anImaginaryEcho @SenBlumenthal Uninformed, uneducated silly little egg...Let me know when you grow into a chicken. #hangry
Ecigarettes do have a small amount of tobacco in them that has been vaporized. They do help chronic tobacco users reduce if not quit cig use
SHOW ME WHERE THE TOBACCO IS IN THIS. I DARE YOU.
Look it up
btw hint: nicotine is not tobacco
Nicotine is contained in tobacco. Where are all you coming from
What do you base this on? This is an uninformed statement & if you would care to know the truth, I would be happy to share.
They said smoking had health benefits in the early days. @senblumenthal
Please enlighten us  as to how this is so? Thank you in advance.
.@SenBlumenthal 

What is the #ROI for your statment?
Might you back that up with a single citation to a study?
throw smokers out of insurance pools. Let them die. Why should we pay for their stupidity? Let their co-dependent family pay
.@SenBlumenthal Ur right ... IF i burn my #ecigs to SMOKE them, THIS would be unhealthy ...

Everyone knows politicians lie w/ ease @SenBlumenthal I'd rather trust science than your words

#vapingsaveslives
all these people asking you for honest scientific proof to your statement and still no answer ??? Because it's a lie
not sure I agree with you on this one. IMHO not enough data on this yet
Over 100s of studies. 95% healthier. Less than 1% the cancer risk of cigs. More than enough data.
My god, the level of fatuousness in this one tweet is astounding.
The letter you sent today is an abomination. You will always be an absolute charlatan. Selling constituents health 2 highest pharma bidder.
Smoked cigs for 45 years. Two paks  of Marlboro Reds ~ started vaping and haven't had a cig in 5 years! #vapingsavedmylife
So is your state loosing too much money from the MSA then . Gotta get those folks smoking again at all costs. Shame on you.
Dick, why don't you let me worry about what I put in my body and you worry about...well, whether your tighty-whities R clean
Jesus, being that stupid must hurt. And I mean A LOT.
Are doctors that recommend their adult smoking patients switch to vaping trying to kill them then? #TinFoilBlumenthal
Back when I had a vape shop, before filthy animals like you bankrupted it, new customers wld routinely say "doctor sent me".
Thank you for perfectly demonstrating why @Surgeon_General should be fired. Now tell us more...
I apologise in advance, but there is only one possible response to this utter bullshit. ....
#JeebusWept
based on what evidence
We are not big tobacco. We are mom & pop's nationwide.  RCP says 95% safer - they are not lying.  #wearevapor #ecigssavelives
Lobbyist monger. Show us the science!
liquid "nicotine!" Most deadly. OD killed children. In literature before granted approvals @DEAHQ @FDArecalls @USDA 
.@SenBlumenthal
Garbage, plain and simple. I've been vaping for 8 years. Still alive, BP down, lung function improved, no more bronchitis.

you are not a scientist. You make such ridiculous claims..your words could encourage smokers to continue2smoke&die.
I'm a specialist, I have patients whose blood pressure have gone from high 2normal just after a few months by switching2ecigs
You are contributing to a chain of thought that will lead to more deaths than the holocaust. Mostly the poor.
I'm 62, run marathons, and vape.  Your comments will keep ppl smoking.  Is that what you want? (Sorry folks - same photo.)
what utter bullshit. Try some science?
.@SenBlumenthal are @RCPLondon @UKCTAS and @PHE_uk part of the tobacco industry?
.@SenBlumenthal or maybe the man who led the creation of the WHO FCTC?
.@Surgeon_General http://goo.gl/3a2HZF  Full of false, misleading , deceptive statements re #ecigs. Needs a health warning: do not read!
Contrary to #fakenews spread by @SenBlumenthal, #ecigs are #harmless & cut into the #tobacco tax #con that #democrats use to rob the poor
Now now, it's not just the democrats. All politicians use it to rob the poor.
Does ignorance run in your family or are you just a "special boy"??
And to think that the Democrats were allegedly the party of science. At least, that's the brand.
ROFLMAO.....and yet you wonder why DEMOCRATS keep losing.......
WHEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND? WE ARE NOT FUCKING SMOKING.
Contrary to what @SenBlumenthal would have you believe, he's taken millions from Pharma and is doesn't give a crap abt his constituents.

you sir are unfortunately the one of the idiots in charge who have no clue about what you speak of.
Proof? No?  Just lie then
LIAR
Proof? I have dozens of pieces of research that state otherwise. What about thousands who were able to quit analog cigs?
. You, sir, are an outright liar.
*citation needed.
aha would you ate me arse! Back that up with evidence of back down.
it's difficult to fathom why you would advertise your stupidity so openly on such a public forum. #thinkbeforeyoutweet
5+ yrs vaping. No more strokes & BP now normal. FYI, you can't smoke an ecig. BTW, vaping is not tobacco industry!
I thought GOP were supposed to be the science deniers?
Politics of fear. Go suck a solar panel.
So go on, how much did you just get paid to spout that nonsensical line?
Does it hurt being this stupid?
#fakenews
You know nothing. Mind your own business.
.@SenBlumenthal Should we be concerned about all vapor in the air?
How much did the makers of Nicorette pay you to post this?
Do you have ANY proof of that?
Well thank God we have you to protect us from cradle to grave, you whiny busy body.
Nobody but a complete fool would say they are deadly!!
perhaps do some RESEARCH before you say something. I mean, iI know you have interns to do that for you.

do you believe everything you read? #cretin
It is you who is the deadly hazard with your utter lies.
tell you who benefits more big p, cancer's a big ticket item
E-Cigs DO NOT 'smoke' There is no combustion whatsoever!
#DoYourResearch
how?
It's a shame that you can't protect children from blatant lies and "studies" most probably funded by Big Tobacco...
think you wanna look more at big pharmaceutical for this shit
5+ years vaping, no more strokes & blood pressure normal again. BTW, you vape e-cigs, & it isn't tobacco industry 4 vape?
Deadly, eh? Care to back that up with a shred of evidence, or you just going to keep on making things up?
Boy the IQ bar to become a US senator must be set REALLY low
so the British government and health service are wrong then??
We hope in the light of this you'll support reducing our children's exposure to nightshade vegetables.
People who know anything about ecigs can identify that they are not smoked.
But they are less deadly than regular cigs AND you can regulate your own nicotine levels, and thus break the habit entirely.
Deadly? Has someone died from using them?
The only things dying from e-cig use are MSA tobacco bonds and the pharma cessation scams.
