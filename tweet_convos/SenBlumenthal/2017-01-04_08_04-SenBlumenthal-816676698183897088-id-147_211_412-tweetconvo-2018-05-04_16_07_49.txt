@SenSchumer @SenateDems -when will people learn that you take øbamas word as the exact opposite! ACA has increased costs.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems you messed this up from the start.  Let it get fixed.  Tell the truth st least once in your career
Insurance was cheaper the old way, better deductables, and Wasn't paying for other people.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems where r u coming from? My healthcare cost increased 62% & my deductable $14,900 not a happy dem here!
Actually this is a lie.  We still have millions without healthcare:Millions of middle class without
U mean like "u can keep ur plan, u can keep ur doctor save 2500.00/year." How is all that working out for you?
Well, Senator, you're from Connecticutt.  So it's expected you'd give full-throated support to Obama.
i think we will prosper&survive wO the 2700 pages of bill &20000 regulations. What a pack of fools.
Dem get heads out of Obama's butt y'all already loop holed over 100,000 retired auto workers loss Thier coverage
It would not. We have already been traumatized by this horrible law. Go away like you were suppossed
@SenSchumer @SenateDems this is false Dick
What do u pay Senator 4 health Ins - mine was 608 now 915 a month - 3000 out of pocket - this is not ACA - repeal it
LIE!
Why can't it be demanded that Trump show his tax returns?  He's in cahoots with Russia
My premiums should have to go up to pay for the lazy fucks to get insurance who don't want to work #repealtheACA
@SenSchumer @SenateDems RAISE COSTS??    Are you on planet Earth.  Haven't you heard.  Obamacare= JOKE.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems 
FAKE NEWS!
Raise costs?  Obamcare?  Looke at Arizona and other states, your guys are crazy.  Drain the swamp
Wake up! Obama's legacy will be in ashes. One of Americas's  WORST Presidents.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems I'll let you ass' come no pay my to then if your think Obama care is so great what's your address
Lying Obama & Dems desperate to scare ppl into thinking it'll be repealed w/o being replaced.
For those upset about the costs - it's called market reality. If ACA is dismantled, you will get a real taste.
If it's so good, why did Chris Dodd require $100M for a new hospital in order to vote for it?
Please stop it, If Obamacare was good U would be on it. We can start bye putting you all in 1st

How many Americans have Healthcare they can't utilize because of High Deductables? It's Useless to many of us
Obama had no govt experience when he took office and he still doesn't.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems That is what ACA did- because "you can keep your doctor " was a flat out lie from the start!
We should trust this zero-integrity scumbag who lied about serving in Vietnam? #StolenValor
Wrong! You don't listen either. Eloquent remarks? He can't even talk without a teleprompter.
SO BE IT!
Come up with compromise plan minimizing losses within reasonable cost parameters. Stop talking,DO it!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Rates couldn't go any higher than they have went up #YouWouldntKnowThatDueToMePayingYOURBill
PRoblem is 2 many Americans who voted Trump dont' realize they are on Obamacare wait till gone shock
@SenSchumer @SenateDems If Obama's stupid ACA is so great why did he exempt himself from its punitive provisions? Repeal it!
- These negative people have never read nor understood what is in the ACA. Dems need to send info out to counter
60% of physicians claim ACA has reduced the quality of care. What are you going to do about that horrible fact?
Doctors/hospitals charge what insurers will pay;stupid system. Break the system so the consumer rules
ACA  NOT consumer friendly. Health care must be consumer driven.Let's see doctor and hospital prices.
ACA isn't health care reform,it is health insurance reform. It's time to address cost of care and healthy living.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Bull 
@SenSchumer @SenateDems the only people happy with it are those getting it free!
maybe you should have read the #aca before passing it?
He lied when he sold it to the american people and he is lying now.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Is it true that none of those in Senate and House of Rep  are on Obamacare? If not, why not?
@SenSchumer When you pay a premium and then have a high deductible who would even notice except the insurance co's
oh like what Obamacare has done?
@SenSchumer @SenateDems OBAMACARE IS WHAT IS RAISING HEATH CARE COST
@SenSchumer @SenateDems If you control people's healthcare& $ you have total control of people! No way Dems., Why you lost!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems IS ANYONE SURPRISED? OBAMA SPOUTING MORE LIES W TOTAL DEM. SUPPORT! Not HC,All about political power!
Bravo, Senator Schumer, for standing up to the sociopath!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems my rates tripled via the ACA and are more than my house payment. How is that fair?
Dem lefties have no idea what might happen.  Provide evidence not hysterical speculation.
Sounds like what happened when Obamacare was enacted... Except now we might be able to get out Doctors back!
Keep pushing that phony narrative you political hack!  No wonder Trump won #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Really? You communists have have created divide and chaos for 8 years. We are sick of it
BULLSHIT!! You worthless politicians are forcing us to buy a product/service from the govt via AHA
@SenSchumer @SenateDems  Obamacare has created chaos for those who had healthcare before Obamacare
Then I suggest you along with Pelosi, Schummer, Hillary, and Obama pay for the ACA. We quit paying for moochers.
Roughly 60 million ppl ironic almost the same amount that voted for  Hillary
Focus on Bridgeport, CT
Is ripping away Health Care we overpay 4 as not to go to Jail that covers 0 bad? Its not. Learn truth
@kflo210 @SenateDems Let them do it. I can't WAIT for the backlash from those screaming REPEAL who will lose benefits.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Bullshit!!!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems, deal all... It would be my Pride to prove you wrong ! Just need my "Ball"...
time for @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi to call #ACA repeals #GOPDeathPanels via @PRyan & @SenateMajLdr! @sherrilee7 @SenateDems
@SenSchumer @SenateDems 
@SenSchumer @SenateDems can't raise cost any faster than you guys are already doing!! Great job on failing America
@SenSchumer @SenateDems liars... no one is listening to you
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Pelosi said costs have decreased that is not true for self-employed middle/upper class big increase
Been wrong on everything else not good odds this is right.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems 
Under ACA millions lost their private/employer coverage and they lost their Doctors.
#SchumerClowns
@SenSchumer @SenateDems crying liberals so fun to watch.

Raise costs, THAT is funny! I now pay nearly $12k/year for health insurance, $450/pay!
People can't keep doctors , doctors dropping medicare , oh yeah jobs being lost / hours reduced
Wait its already cost triilions from the start , raise costs on people with private insurance
@SenSchumer @SenateDems and you know this how? ACA has already skyrocketed premiums.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems why didnt you tell us aca would be this crappy
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Obama lied when he said our premiums would go down with ACA.Elections have consequences,he said that.
Exactly. Ppl seem 2 4get how expensive healthcare was b4 ACA, lifetime caps, preexisting conditions etc, etc!
We need u all to stay strong on ACA, Medicare & Social Sec. Repub's are messing with people's lives!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems sure Obama articulated it well to you, though - you bought it hook, line & sinker ELOQUENT my A**!
if you think Pres Obama's remarks are eloquent than you sir are as delusional as he is.
Just like ACA did when it was FORCED on USA.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Obama is an embarrassment & disgrace, with Schumer & Pelosi!  LOSERS!!! Oh, blame it on Russia too
@SenSchumer @SenateDems If OBAMAWHOCARES is so great, why aren't all of you Dems on it !! Stop lying !!
WHY IS CONGRESS EXEMPT FROM OBAMA CARE if it is so great for the rest of us???  HYPOCRITES!!!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems I'm a citizen who called spkr Ryan's office. Asked if kids can see doc "day 2" aide was rude. No ansr
None of you cared when the exact same thing happened under Obamacare. You hypocrite!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems... looks like the poor are getting HC.. doesn't cost them a dime with Medicaid.. #DeathByDemocrats
Another Obama lie.  Nobody believes it but you.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems quit limiting ins. Companies and let them compete across borders
Please keep fighting to save the ACA! Can't you put a cap on the insurance companies rates? They're all crooks!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems # anymore lies
@SenSchumer @SenateDems they don't have accessible care with high premiums and high deductibles
@SenSchumer @SenateDems how much more propaganda are you people going to put out there stop with the lies we are tired.
@senschumer 20,000,000
You are so full of it. Take the blindfold off. America knows better stop insulting their intelligence
Didn't that already happen?
