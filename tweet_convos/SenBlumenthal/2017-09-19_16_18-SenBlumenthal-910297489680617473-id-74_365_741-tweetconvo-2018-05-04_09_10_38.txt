Clapper,Comey,HRC and Wassermann should be the ones looking for a pardon....
There's no evidence, trial or conviction yet!  And you all have pardoned him????
Any president that defends Russia and Russian colluders against the evidence of his own intelligence agencies is a traitor.
Not necessarily
You know that you all led DICK! He was tapped and you're ok with that?
Nazi Mueller is going to start FRAMING people so it looks like he's doing something.  They will sue his pants off, but we will pay Billion$
It's a good thing Bloomy was in Vietnam to save the day or that sh!t would've got really out of hand. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYOqqLKq1_g â€¦ You have a problem with President Donald J. Trump pardons? Did Bill Clinton have a different standard?

Russian problems go both ways. The left wouldn't have you hear it.
Russia on both sides, both sides... yeah, right. Spare us the ridiculous equivocation.
Sorry, Rem. Didn't realize the New York Times was #fakenews. Did you even have your mom read it to you before firing off that drivel? Night.
So lame. You cornflakes just can't stand the truth
Russians win by having you believe they aren't influencing all sides of our government. That your side is "right". You'll ignore evidence!
DID YOU HEAR THAT @realDonaldTrump ??
YOU ARE GOING 2 JAIL
#MUELLERTIME
Plus Trump can't pardon state level crimes.
Manafort will roll to try to keep his kids out of jail.
Same as Flynn.
Dems said the same thing when Bush 41 pardoned Cap Weinberger. Same predictable playbook just a different decade. Support @POTUS #MAGA
Presidential pardons and electoral college, two obsolete things that need to be corrected now that candidates can be anyone.
They will  get him in a state charge so he can't be pardoned
Keep talking Blumenthal, I love hearing the truth come out of your mouth, it gives me hope
What an " IDIOT"

.@TuckerCarlson Breaks Down New #Trump Wiretap Report: 'Rogue' Intel Agencies or DC 'Collusion' http://bit.ly/2w5ziuM  | #Tucker 
Trump is going to pardon them all, including himself. We all know they are crooks and in cahoots with the Russians!
Trump Tower was wired tapped and you need to apologize to President Trump.. you got caught again for lying ! Shameful !
From your lips to gods ears.
let me get this straight...exercising a constitutional, plenary power would be a crime?
How do we call Hillary Clintos pardon? Obstruction of justice as well? Just wondering
A pathetic interview from a pathetic egotistical Senator - just surmising with no real facts
Using that reasoning i guess nobama is guilty of treason for releasing Bradley Manning!
Don't you have to be found guilty  to get a pardon,  is this your evidence #hatersgonnahate
#term limits
Oh please the people on the left got away with so much Hillary and her pay for play Obama destroying us giving money to a terrorist country
You people on the left have broken so many laws N no one has done anything.this countryWill not comeTogetherUntilTheLeft  paysForWhat it did
@MSNBC: #Blowhards & #Fools! #NeverWatch! #Boycott!
but bama pardons, including a traitor is ok with blum, a fake Vietnam vet? Only on fakenews!
The phony Vietnam vet Sen. Bluminidiot, the epitome of disgrace, is once again dragged out by Matthews as some expert on ethical behavior..!
. Blumenthal is peeing his pants, things just not going his way these days. Wonder what's in your closet Senator.

Should Trump pardon Obama?
@HardballChris What does it say when a sitting president wiretaps the oppositions campaign?
Exercising the constitutional power of pardon can't be an obstruction of justice
just when you thought blumenthal couldn't be any more dopier...
Additional evidence? There is zero evidence of obstruction
Is Manafort worth it? We will see.
Omg, or evidence of improper/illegal and untruthful denial of wire tapping
There they are an IDIOT and Shakey legs
Additional when was first!? Comey lied under oath dragging him back to court.
@SenatorBurr @MarkWarner The Sen Intel Committees actions today is exactly how the USSR committees did business. It is entirely UN-American.
Wasn't that what Comey, Lynch & Obama orchestrated for HRC in June 2016, Guess that was evidence of obstruction also!!!
Sen. Blumenthal also approved of shutting down hearing because citizen Cohen exercises his right to make a public statement & defend himself
Lololol! 
Obama, Fisa & Trump.
#FAKE NEWS Paul Manafort hasn't been accused; let alone been indicted of a crime. Pure Propaganda. Sen. Blumenthal is push innuendo campaign

Wouldn't every pardon, by its nature, be an obstruction of justice?
Just shut up already, why dont u talk bout previous admin spying on political opponents. Talk about russia dems tried 2 cheat the whole time
If he does that, shame on him! This man is an enemy of the state!
Senator, I applaud you.
I applaud your stolen valor senator. Which by the way, is against the law.
And Obama & his administration ordering the intelligence apparatus 2 spy on an opposition party during a presidential campaign is outrageous
Not too mention illegal
I really think they're gonna try it though
You're an ass
"Could be." I'm ready for these assumptions to be definitive.

Clapper lied.  Trump was wired-tapped. Dishonest CLAPPER!
What more do they NEED, ffs?
I thought something was strange. Clapper's nose was literally growing
At last, his nose matches his pointy ears. Fuckin' bureaucrat creep!
