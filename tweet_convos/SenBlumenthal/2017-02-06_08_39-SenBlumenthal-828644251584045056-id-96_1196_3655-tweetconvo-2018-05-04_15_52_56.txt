#StopDeVos she doesn't believe in accountability standards 4all schools & her plans exclude kids w/disabilities on IEPs/IDEA
can believe anything you say you probably got one call
riiiiiiight...and she'll still get the  bc this is all just a fucking game...#TheResistance needs to WAKE UP @BFostersbox
what would the next step be? Impeach her?
And the Republicans will ignore it anyway.The only thing that can stop this mess is voting
them out of office next year
Apparently they can.  Republicans have a lock to rubber stamp whatever Trump wants.
@billyeichner Well, sadly America was ignored and the ramifications will be felt for years.
The empty suit has spoken
Her children never attended public schools!
Nor did Sen. Blum.. or his kids! Greenwich schools aren't good enough, yet he wants kids stuck in bad schools!
DeVos Schools that she has ruined perform in the bottom one third! Who wants kids stuck in bad schools?
@BetsyDeVos @tedcruz @JohnCornyn. They can and they have. That's the most shocking take-away from all of this. #resist
How much money did you get from the teachers unions?
Less than DeVos paid out.
Nope. #devos gave $121K in 2016. Family single digit millions. Teachers Unions - $33.2M 2016, 93% to dems
20 plus years ago uou could receive an education in Ct. Today is questionable common core is not a proper education.
Well I'm happy it worked...
Thank you for your work on behalf of veterans chaptered out of the military. I was, but my senators won't help me at all.
Wants to teach christianity in all schools no matter the law. just saw an ad in AZ that demeaned pub schools
I got a *fantastic* education in #publicschools in the 70s & 80s. What led to privatization efforts in 1st place?
you're not fit to serve. You did the ultimate disgrace. You lied about military record. #pathetic
We need to think about term limits. Would you agree ?
I've already called my republican senators. They are still voting for her. Any other ideas?
@ElaineSowersby Thank you Senator Blumenthal, because of you and Chris Murphy I know you have our best interests in mind.
what a pair. One lied about his military record the other lied about his finances. Too much lying
stolen valor??!
1 step above a child molester as far as I'm concerned. Y should anyone care what u think? Dirty liar.
you would like to think so 
Devote is the best for our educational system no more indoctrination of kids by the federal gov
Yep, just hearing from liberals. The calls you had before the election didn't tell you much either. lol
-  then again, you don't take or answer calls from those who disagree with your crony bias.
And yet...
Thanks Senator Blumenthal.  Proud to live in CT.
Yet...we have her anyway.
@billyeichner as a #CT constituent, thank you for voting no. I wish we could've gotten one more #GOP vote but we fought hard.
@kharyp  can you stop it, did you convince even one more republican? Complaining won't do any good.
Sandyhook shooter used the gun of someone else as all criminals do -leaving us without gunprotection
speaking on behalf of Sandyhook is reprehensible how dare you guns would've saved their lives
@billyeichner given the state of public education as it is now. She couldn't do to much more damage.
For many low income children, their only chance of escaping poverty is education.  It is unacceptable to even consider her.
@billyeichner Teachers Unions say, "Jump". Dick says, "How High!?"
American libs have been clear, all you care about!
@RealLucasNeff Thank you , Senator. #resist
@billyeichner who should I call?? She shouldn't be in charge of our kids #goawaylady
TY @SenBlumenthal! My niece & nephews receive(d) outstanding public educations in CT, something DeVos would never understand. #NoOnDeVos
From her home town, went to school with her daughter. Consensus in Grand Rapids is the same. She has no grasp on reality.
thank you!
.@SenBlumenthal @billyeichner well can you help with @marcorubio and @ who isn't  receiving calls ... been calling for a week #FL #Senate
@billyeichner yay! CT represent!
@NEAToday Answer the question..how much have you taken from @NEAToday ??
thank you!
if we've been clear, why is @SenToomey ignoring us?
I wonder why everyone is NOT addressing the things that would have kept delusions out of The White House. Melania knows more.
@NEAToday #notdevos
right, she is unfit for education secretary
@ChrisMurphyCT @greta @MSNBC I support Ms. DeVoss as she fights for equal rights for children!
Just because some morons held their daily temper tantrum doesn't mean they are right.
paid for by @georgesoros
Finally!
Never underestimate ignorance of American ppl! We still got Trump & Devos wud of destroyed what's left HOP education cuts.
Preserve and protect the education system that produced citizens who know better than to be misled by an anti-intellectual.
PLEASE tell me that's true!
Hard to believe there is anyone FOR her!  Thank you for speaking out against her.
thanks for listening!
Liberals make it clear that children will not win, and the left caters to the powerful teachers unions
I called my Senators and asked them to support Devos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eUlVxo3x14 â€¦
thank you
all the calls are from teachers unions  who dont want thier playhouse turned over.
You mean liberal demacrats have been  clear. What about the Republican majority?  Screw us right?
majority?!!?? #alternativefacts #alternativefacts #lies
It does not appear anyone (else) is going to defect from the GOP. She will get the nod. Let's move on to getting Trump OUT!
With all the electoral votes Trump got you should stand with his nominees
before 1980 department didn't exist, education has gone down hill since
@KillerMartinis but they are being ignored. @SenToomey claims we're paid protesters & denies all efforts made by PA voters
Thank you Senator.  #DeVos is not qualified!!
While you're at it, you mind keeping your son in-check? kthxbai...
ITA. And Donald Trump is showing that he is not fit to be President.
are you part of the global elite? Hmmmm
Can you convince even 1 more fellow @GOP Senator? @marcorubio ? @SenJohnMcCain? Not one more honorable?
is FL senator where #SchoolChoice is VERY succesful!!!
yes, & image how much more congress would have received if your poor tech could ensure everyone could actually reach congress
@Lee_in_Iowa Not fit in the least.

You are correct. Thank you Senator.
And will there be a third Republican joining the no vote?
Neither is Pruitt for EPA.
Wrong, @SenBlumenthal!!! @BetsyDeVos is so good at education, it's unbelievable. I mean, she can totally read. Not sad.
who is setting such a low bar? You? Go away troll. Rep & Dem both do Not want this unqualified billionaire.@SenBlumenthal
but the ones that tell you to just vote can right?
convince your GOP colleagues, please.
