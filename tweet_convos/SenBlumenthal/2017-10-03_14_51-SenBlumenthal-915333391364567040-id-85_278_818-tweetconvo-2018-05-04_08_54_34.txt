I will introduce a measure to close the loophole that lets a buyer walk away with a gun if the background check is not complete in 72 hrs.
Enough of the evasions and euphemisms. Vast majorities of Americans demand action – it’s long past time for Congress to deliver.
the democrats had total control of the house and senate and were not able to do anything after Sandy Hook
Wrong. Democratic Senate, Republican House.
house speaker Pelosi
i stand corrected i apologize but the demand of gun regulations have been needed for years Columbine
Thank you. We desperately need courageous politicians who can resist the #NRA's #bloodmoney.
your about stupid the bump stock does not make it automatic ask any military armorer
Sorry, but we don’t have it in our power. Look at Chicago with toughest gun laws in country. Z Left’s anger needs curbed.
Not sure if you understand that Chicago is in America. Where we have very lax federal gun control laws.
Chicago isn't in Canada, England, Japan, or Australia where they have excellent gun control laws. That's why Chicago has so many shootings.
So congress has power to outlaw evil???? Wow so congress is God??
In yourpower yes. In your methods, no!
U & Dems did zip when U had Prophet Obama, Pelosi Maj N House, Reid Maj N SEN. U did O-care why not GUN Care. Doing nothing lies at yer feet
Unconstitutional and wrong. Read the constitution or resign.

Yeah, ban Democrats from owning weapons.
I lost my sister to gun violence. I speak for her at every parole hearing.  I speak for her now. WAKE UP AMERICA.  IF NOT NOW, WHEN?!?
LMAO you do nothing about Chicago for 8 years now you want my 2nd Amendment rights. Weapons apons have no minds

To have rights taken away; a person must be adjudicated mentally deficient by a judge not some gov worker. We have due process in the US.
You say "complicit" I say "guilty". Congress takes NRA money and people die. Congress takes NRA money and votes AGAINST the majority.
Blumenthal 2020
Great idea! Because that will stop criminals! Don't we have laws against murder?? Criminals don't care about that
Yes, they are.
that is astatement by a man who has no clue what he is talking about. congress isn't responsible for the asshole in vegas
Go pound sandy
#PickADate Don't let republicans say now is not the time/we'll discuss later. The can has been kicked too many Xs. Time has run out!
Was a American.All you want to do is stop guns.Hillary and these Hollywood  starts doesnt need secruity or their family's. Trump supporter
You can not stop this it find for a gun check but not to take people guns away.I think you need to stop people from coming here.I know this
You lie and we see you.
any and all men who own automatic weapons are psychologically unstable growing worse and more dangerous over time, no bkg check needed
Bull shit
Absolutely complicit. We will find each & every one of their balls snugly papered with $100s from the NRA.
Push the issuehow many more need to be slaughtered

So are the enablers who declare they will kill government employees if they come for their guns. #GrabACrowbar
How will you control guns sold on the streets that don’t require paperwork, or have a serial number.  Solution senator?
All rhetoric, no basis in reality.  Your modus operandi, CT deserves much much better
What is your recommendation on gun control?
Where do you find the time? Taking credit for PR, getting gun control, impeaching trump, lying about your service time...so many hrs/day
Right on!
Make murder a crime
Since the USA government did  9/11, is disarming the citizens really a good idea?
how did that work out for the citizens of Mexico? How about at the bataclan theater
How are  you going to keep illegal guns from criminals and anyone else who would pay the price?  We'll wait, let's hear......
It hasn’t worked in Chicago - it’s that simple.
It’s ok to say it. Congress is elected, run and controlled by @NRA
You misspelled "Soros"
and each time, we have the same tired conversation..
I agree with you in principle, but not strategy. You call for incremental steps. The other side points out that what you propose won't /1
be effective. You have no answer for that, and your position is to get more moderate and incremental. Instead of going wimp, go bold. /2
You were complicit every single day you lied about your military record. #fakeSoldier
Can you please tell me ... what do you propouse? Put you money where you mouth is ...why when Democrats had a veto proff congress you did 0
there are no solutions to current gun laws, repeal and replace on federal level is the only real solution
And Congress is complicit with every dollar they take from the #NRA
Well you might want to tell your GOP members that because Americans are sick of it!!  We need the NRA out of our government
@gop is complicit period
We must expose the greed.  https://stopgreednow.com/greed-economics-and-the-customer …
Flood the floor with gun control bills.  Let people see who is actually out to improve the situation
Do you really @SenBlumenthal? How's that working for Chicago? You fake politicans are all talk and no action.

#WelcomeToAmerica
346 deaths in mass shootings so far this year. 302 Republicans in Congress. How many will vote for gun control to help save a life?
complicit is more like bought and paid by the NRA, no shame!!
Dear, Sen. We have communicated in the past and I am grateful for that, but please do something to end this madness! Thank you.
I wonder how many would change their mind if they were in the same situation as the people in Las Vegas.
Same with pillaging of our democracy being carried out by Trump & co. Impeach
By taking everyone's gun go for it your not getting mine!!! Veteran
How would you have survived 'Nam without your gun? Oh, wait... Poser
So quick to blame the tool and not the nut.  How did you protect yourself in Nam?.....oh wait...
all dems Must remove guns from taxpayers funded body guards! Then talk gun control!
How about passing a bill requiring all gun owners to take and pass a Drug Test.
You are giving up the last line of defense for democracy.
Focus on preserving civ rights of VICTIMS of gun violence, NOT whether *might* violate rights of a few mentally/emotionally deficient folks
KKKongress supports & funds Domestic Terrorism.. So does the GOP! Vanilla ISIS for security detail?
Especially @SteveScalise
Lobotomy for you sun shine
You haven’t acted for years
There are more guns than citizens what are you gonna do knock on everyone’s door and demand their guns.  That ain’t gonna happen.
We the people must insist.
Huh? Maybe you should have a talk with Hillary first..
Hillary Clinton & gun control. 
Gun control! How's that working in Chicago. Please explain to us sheeple how not being able to protect ourselves has anything to do with a..
Never Trumper Liberal lunitic x 2 now?
Precisely same is true...about impeachment Senator.

Exactly how many crimes does it take before Congress will do it's job to protect COTUS?
Tele novelas @jimmykimmel actor see read what calls to him as needs to advance! See known in California ©™® Barrio boy need dialect
Scrap books  at Gary Coleman plan future now ©™®
@GOP @NRA seem to disagree Senator...Hate to break it to you...
you illuminati masons organized this massacre  so you can push gun control
Political grandstanding.
They are in no way complicit - stop sensationalizing murder to push your anti-constitutional agenda
