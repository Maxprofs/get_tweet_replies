How many reached out to support you in Vietnam?
they didn't....
@SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @SenSanders @SenFranken THANK YOU! #holdthefloor #VoteNoDevos #DumpDevos
@TrumpysTaxes  Still buying her way into the job, guess if you're incompetent that's all you can do!  On CNN @ 6pm
Her way may work. The liberal way sure hasn't worked for years and is just dumbing down our kids.
Must not allow GOP to run entire gov't like Gestapo. Need true majority and NO Dems excluded like a kindergarten. FIGHT!
GOP senators need to know, not the time to vote along party lines at the expense of our students. #NotoDeVos
@SenateDems AWESOME WORK!! #holdthefloor Vote NO to Devos. #noDevos #VoteNoDevos
when will you stop acting like #SoreLosers and support #Potus to #MAGA ? #Connecticut
@SenateDems  you all will be voted out , we the people are sick of you're indoctrination of liberalism into our schools ..
@People4Bernie we need to engage enough where 14000 is an average number of calls a senator gets about all bills.
Thank you for representing Americans who demand "unchallengeably qualified" SoE. #NotoDeVos #holdthefloor
@athens_lawyer -- I'd love to know the number of people (myself included) who reached out to @senrobportman.
I was one of them! Thank you for listening and for doing the right thing!
tell the GOP senators to vote for our students, not for the party. Thank you for your efforts.
Thank you for standing up against DEVOS @SenBlumenthal
thank you for your support on this issue!
ok. What's Plan B? Tell me what's next!
@SenateDems    #VoteDemsOut.   #confirmDeVos
@People4Bernie it's not that big a number. It proves that generally we're just not paying attention and this is the result.
I hope not. Because #WeThePeople were ignored in the primaries. Hope you truly plan to act and LISTEN.
wow never realized how unfairly women were treated. You didn't put up this big of a fuss for his other picks. #notmysenator
All Democrats lol. That's not bi partisan support
@SenateDems Thank you for standing up for our public schools against those who want to destroy them.
I was 1 of the 14,000. Thank you for listening!
Thank you!
Bridgeport, CT.
Loser!
@SenateDems @SenBlumenthal Thank you!
@thepoliticalcat Make it 14,000 and 1.
@march4teachers Thank you for your support! We are there with you in spirit tonight. Keep fighting the good fight.
DeVos must not take over the education of our children.
thank you Senator!
Thank you for listening!
Thank you! Proud that you're my senator.
@SenateDems #GOP doesn't care they send their kids & grand kids to private schools,probably with our tax dollars,r her's

Thank you for opposing DeVos!!
@nansmith61 Thank you!

@SenateDems How many were hired by George Soros?
@SenateDems I'm sure if @SenTedCruz & @JohnCornyn would have more. If they answered their phone! #VoteNoDevos
@chrissyjensen to the detriment of poor kids trapped in a failing corrupt gov ed racket. But yre ok, Your base goes private.
Not true.
Vote No DeVos. She bought her way to this appointment.  Totally unqualified.  We need an educator for this position.
@SenateDems wait 14,000? 14,000?!?!?! That's like 0.00000000000000000002% of the population! Wow!!!
@SenateDems that's almost half a percent of Connecticut's population! #BetsyDeVos
@SenateDems @SenateGOP which GOP senator is going to man up
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr The sad thing is Republicans got more but won't tell anyone. Rather hide & disconnect
I'm sure you're not smart enough to realize you hear primarily from Democrats in your district not Republicans
Has anyone ever told you how astute you are? Nah--didn't think so.
Red taking over as your voter base is the minority and out of touch. You will be out of office soon enough unless u wake up
thank you Senator for speaking on behalf of your constituents!! Elm City loves you.
@SenateDems how many have reached out in support of her?
@SenateDems Please + thank you! We won't forget who stood up and who stood by.
I would have reached to your office too, but I was trying to get @marcorubio to answer his phone!
@SenateDems vote No on DeVos
Thank you, Blumenthal!
