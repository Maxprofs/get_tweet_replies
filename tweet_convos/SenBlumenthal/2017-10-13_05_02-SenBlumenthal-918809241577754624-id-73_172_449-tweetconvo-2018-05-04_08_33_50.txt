Mean-spirited, rash, irrational - Trump's ending critical ACA subsidies shreds health care protections and shatters promises.
Congress must rescue health care from Trump sabotage. Onward Sens. Alexander & Murray. Bipartisan work is our only hope.
Yeah, and what are we going to do about it ? This is just one in several hundred Trump disasters. Tweets are not working.
You mean one of Trumps success stories
If that rods the world of scum like you. Sign me up.
Seriously Obamacare has her millions of Americans High premiums High deductibles 9 million don't have it.. stop lying to the American people
Do you have a phone attached to your hand is this what you do all day you tweet more than YOUR PRESENT Richard did you tweet in Nam
Sabotage Definition: The termination of the illegal unappropriated funding of subsidies to insurance companies brought forth by Obama & Dems
It was destined to fail from the beginning
About time Freeloaders were asked to pay for something. Premiums under Obamacare skyrocketed! Middle class getting killed. Want it...earn it
Senator, agree with you. Now get this moronic dotard out of the WH
Yea! Onward Alexander & Murry! Where is your name? Yup you got it, it's up to congress to get off their butts, but UR a spectator
I really don't mean to call you out all the time, it's just that you aren't honest with your constituents. The truth works better. Honest.
You said mean spirited about Daca. What have you done about that? Nothing? Thought so.
The subsidies were already determined to be unconstitutional by the courts. What leg do you stand on?
All I see is a move in the right direction. You didn't give a darn about your constituents to fix a broken system. The ball in your court.
He is evil doing this  when  do the people wake up?
You own Obamacare and you know it's a loser that will harm all Americans! What did you do to fix it? NOTHING!!!
Don't blame Trump. Been a disaster for years,  getting worse daily. Republicans suck too, 8 years no plan.  I could figure this out in a day
The payments were against the law.  You are lying but we would expect anything less from Dick B the Vietnam vet.

Shut up @SenBlumenthal. It’s UR party that forced this crap bill down our throats. How dare u try 2 blame it on Trump. He’s trying 2 help.
Except the 12 million who couldn't afford it 
sorry we don't steal money from other programs to fund other programs. I guess u r okay with stealing and misappropriation
Haha it helps Americans and you can't stand that.
Obama illegally provided subsudies to providers. But let's not focus on that.

Again nothing done to stop this just talk
4 ALL Americans, Senator; At ths point, pretty much EVERYONE benefits frm #ACA, or family tht does. Doesn't #Congress gt 2 KEEP their #ACA?
He hates us all!
Doesn't hate us. Hate is a human emotion therefore must be human to feel it.
Are You on the Russian payroll to divide our Great Country? I think so       I am calling for a investigation of you
Obamacare is a broken mess
The people who are really responsible for this...their names should be in the headline...mercer and kochs.
Wait till alla psychotics get off their meds and go to washington w their newly purchased bump stocks.
Will Trump's two executive actions on ACA get scored by the CBO?
I hope so. Not that the base will flinch. I don't get it. This guy is sub human and they still love him
Then do something!
Must an Alexander-Murray proposal pass Congress and be signed into law? If not, how would it get implemented?
This is how he is doing it. https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4107922/ACA-Dccircuit-20171013.pdf …


It was doomed before he ever took office. Maybe if democrats worked with republicans to pass it initially it wouldn’t of failed so quickly.
What about Obama stealing money from Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac to pay subsidies to insurance companies. U think that's legal?
3 million ppl now have the freedom to by without being fined
Get the Ins Co. Lawyers away from our Dr.'s
Tragedy? LOLOLOLOL He's improving that abomination. Since congress won't repeal
Welfare and government cheese still available calm down
D.C. Had 7 yrs to fix it
Now it goes back to where it should be
To the States & Free mkt
Get over it , Ins Co.'s left
Citizens could not lve
He is so full of hatred for most Americans and he's unstable, unhinged. #25thAmendment
The depths of his spiteful scorn for the American people knows no bounds.  Truly a catastrophic moment in our history.
Your state is about to take a bigger hit. Keep targeting trucks there's more than one way to get to Massachusetts. Without paying pilot move
We are all in discussion to eliminate driving through Connecticut. The revenue loss will be felt immediately
NastyCrat only upset their donor insurance companies are getting cut. See, we are hurt under ObamaScare, Dems. don't care they R being Paid.
#RIP now #BigPharma #Healthcare #HealthInsurance will just get #richer #republicans #RepublicanMorals #republicanValues
Wait till his base starts seeing their premiums rise. He’ll be holding on to that swamp drain by his fingernails
If only.. I swear he is right. He could kill someone in cold blood and hang on to his base. I guess that is what he is doing-murder!
@ELD_or_ME @RealTrump2016 we need your help stop eld or hr3282
There you go again with the daily democrat buzzwords "sabotage, tragedy".  I see Nancy got the memo this morning too
Tragic for me. Rare disease.
I am so sorry. Makes you want to be Canadian doesn't it?
#ImpeachTrump #25thAmendment
Many are his supporters as well.
