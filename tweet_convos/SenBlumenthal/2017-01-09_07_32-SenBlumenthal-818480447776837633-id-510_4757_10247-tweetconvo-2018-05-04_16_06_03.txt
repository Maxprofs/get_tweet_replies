Thank you. Whether Dem/Rep/Ind, should be no shortcuts for vetting.
all financial  disclosures should be made available several days before hearings. follow the money and DT too

@edlane3 thank you Dinah for you follow
@montanamissoula One can only cringe at the thought of screams coming from GOP and MSM if Dems were trying to pull this crap.
Thank you for trying to stand up to some of the Republicans games.
I wish I could "like" this 1,000 times!
One would think Session's disregard for preparing for a hearing would automatically disqualify him. It would in the real world.

.@SenBlumenthal @DeeLoralei @realDonaldTrump
..... work for a special prosecutor to determine why Hillary had her server cleaned with Bleachkit!
.... Why did you not support a Special Prosecutor on Hillary Clinton?  Are you two faced! It appears so!
Thank you for doing this. Several of these choices need to be looked at further.
@benjamingritton how about requiring @realDonaldTrump to submit HIS financials prior to being sworn in. Hold him accountable
Great Something must be done to hold those accountable who will be in positions of power especially after the info released
@MeatballMom2 Enough of this Wall st/donor satisfying cab picks to raid our gov. Let Cituzens know GOP diesnt support them
Do it! We the people deserve to have due process! Thank you!
.... Democratic Socialism is a wasteland!!!  And, that wasteland was the result of Obama!
Good idea. Should be applied to the President also!
Great idea - how bout we start with sharpton?
Trump should not be allowed his inauguration w/out submitting his tax returns, either.
@onlxn What about President Elects?
You are absolutely correct! There should be no exceptions
thank you, Senator. What a reasonable request.
thank you senator. Hold the line
@TinyPrezHands thank you for your courage!!!!
Thanks.
yes and how about starting at the top! #trumpstaxes
Thank you!
you've got that right, trump doesn't care what the correct way to govern is,he makes new rules & gets away with it
you lost any credibility you had by not supporting General Mattis, Loyal only to your party, and not another Marine!
@yorgus thank you!!
@mo_lazarus and no President as well
Absolutely! Dont make it easy on them the rules apply to everyone even billionaires
yea!
Thank you, Senator.
shameful partisanship by you and dems today with senator session.
Yes! Take control. Please do not let them get away with this.
Thank you, if we let the rule of law and norms fade, so will democracy!
Dems should refuse to attend any confirmation hearing until background checks and financial disclosures are provided.
Do not legitimize an illegitimate process by attending, otherwise it is just words.
Thanks. As an American I feel very worried about conflicts of interest, specially after possible compromise of the election.
how is it possible that the average worker is scrutinized less that Trump nominees.
Thank you Senator! You are a true patriot. We will not forget.
Yes!
And add mental evaluation including the President!
Thanks Blumenthal! appreciated UR work today. Thank you for pushing Sessions today! PLZ get fellow Dem. 2 follow!
thank you!!!! May sanity and patriotism prevail
Thank you, Sir. We need strong democratic voices.
Agreed!!
yes please
Thank you!
Thank you @SenBlumenthal
Thank you for standing up for what is right.
@TuxcedoCat What about applying those rules to #notmypresident Trump? @realDonaldTrump #goldenshowers really?
thank you Senator
Thank you
And a urine test...
Thank you!
thank you. We need to know and see trumps tax ret.#nevermypresident
How about every Senator and Congressman as well. How do you all get so wealthy on a govt. salary??
your Democrats should just stop crying, everybody will have their disclosure vetting process will be the same as it was past.
that's what I m talking about

Especially now when so much information keeps us wondering just how compromised Trump's administration will be.
this should also include the president elect!!!!!!
Politico scores it Obama 7 of 7 OGE cert by hearing and Trump 6 of 9. 1 diff. OGE is complaining overworked . Oh Really?!
GO RICHARD! Most of America supports You!
thank you for your voice of sanity. We need all relevant information prior to confirmation.
. Thank you for your courage !!!
...and for POTUS also.  No person should put thier hand on a bible and swear to lead my country w/o FULL financial disclosure
why should this be a surprise we never saw the "taxes" after "November audit" no no one seems to care
Is it because nobody gave you any awards . I'll give you the award of "ass of the day . You beat out Franken .
thank you, If my company requires a background check as well as drug screen, same should apply to cabinet appointees
Thank you , sir.
Continue to push for full disclosure on nominee background info
@MikeJUofA And now Trump's picks don't want to disclose.
no they wont. Wld prove @realDonaldTrump #Drainstheswamp into the #WestWing @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @SenBlumenthal
Thank God for you!
@MikeJUofA It's time for McConnell to go. Republicans in Washington are deceivers
I guess @realDonaldTrump wants his nominees to be led away in handcuffs?
: Thank you, Mr. Senator for your principled stand. As a citizen, I deeply appreciate it.
I couldn't get hired without a background check, including credit; I work in the private sector!
thank you
Thank you, Senator Blumenthal!
Thank you! Insane to proceed without what should be fundamental requirements
Thank you for your leadership. Confirmations should never be rubber stamped.
Yes! Thank you!
Thank you Senator...we absolutely agree with this.
@CNN @FoxNews @CNBC @NBCNews @MSNBC @GOP @DNC
Good job at today's hearing. You asked real questions re:Trump's illegal activity and Session's response showed his colors
All the required information. All of it.
Welcome to Trumps world.
Thank-you
maybe someone should have done that to you and your sidekick Dan Malloy you guys ruined this state
Thank you, it's a start.
thank you
thank you Senator!
Bravo, and hold strong! It's the law to be vetted. Don't let them get away not abiding by it
I believe several Obama appointees had hearings by the time this letter was sent including Hillary Clinton.
Funny thing is this February 2009 letter is after Hillary Clinton confirmation hearing Jan 13 so was Hillary why it needed!?
please ask Sessions what will he do if administration breaks emoluments clause
Thank you for this.  More need to stand up
just send Senator Dueling Banjos a copy of his 2008 letter to Harry Reid.
@WhiiNot   Start now !!!
They all should show their financial records, including Trump, or be denied entry into our government in DC.@senblumenthal @paulrovira1
agreed
AGREE
Thank you for standing up for the ethical integrity of our processes. @SenBlumenthal
if our country allows this to happen then we're a corrupt, fake democracy. We must not allow this corruption to rule!
thank you sir, from a grateful nation. You are a patriot.
@BlockTrumputin no POTUS or PEOTUS should be either!! #DonaldTrump
@TheTrueAllure an illegitimate president and an illegitimate cabinet.
#HeroRep
Thank you for trying to hold rogue Trump administration to ethical norms. If you let them be above the law, we are finished.
Good luck. But the takeover of the country and the government is almost complete.
Thank you for trying to do your constitutional duty!
Finally the voice of sanity on this issue. Thank you
Thank you sir,for fighting for what is right !
Very reasonable request. Thank you.
@WolfsonLiterary Thank you!
@chrislhayes how about the president elect we have no documentation on him!
That is the right way to do things. Enough with the back door mess
Thank You, Sir!
it's ludicrous to think they could be appointed/confirmed without proper vetting.  But then our new president isn't vetted.
confirmation hearings sound like a GOP opportunity to pat themselves on the back and talk about themselves. theTRUMPinfluence
Excellent! Keep fighting the good fight. #ResistTrump
thank you
Thank you
@SenWarren @RepCummings That's right! It'll take them the next 4 years to finish-then won't be full disclosure!
absolutely they ask that of the Obama administration.
Thank you!!!  I knew you would be on the right side!
please be a patriot!
@Stop_the_Morons without background check, r they related to Russian Oligarch? Who & how they commun,
.@BrianStelter's big question about Trump: "What are his trusted sources of information?" 
yes sir!!!
@vickscan Exactly.
but u got a prez elect that disclosed nothing! No tax we don't even know his real name! Orange Scam @JoyAnnReid @GeorgeTakei
at least we new england folks still have some sense.
@chrislhayes please, please, this is crazy how they think we're stupid and are going to roll over for this, please stand 4 us
@onlxn Please speak out often and clear! I'm one of your constituents.
thank you ..keep fighting for what is right ..help us ..
This is Crazy. Americans must reject this. Nobody or no President should be accorded special treatment
Thank you. Why do the Republicans want to change all rules or ignore rules to accommodate Trump?
stand your ground!
@MJoyce2244 @SenBlumenthal @patrick_darleen DT's biggest con of interest is it's directly w/foreign govt,Thier influence on DT
@chrislhayes It's like he said he's a star he can get away with anything. They let you do it
@chrislhayes great, can you get the rest of your team on the same page?! It's like you guys don't talk to each other!
perfect!!  Say no to Jeff sessions!
Can't they at least go pee in a cup? Won't take long.
@SenBlumenthal
-wow, too late for rapist trump going into the dirty house...
I'm with you. Thanks
say it loud. Like trump taxes, the answer seems to be, "rules don't apply to us".Their goal is to push their agenda,making $$
thank you for your common sense and courage. Be brave!
thank you
Thank you for your pragmatism and action.
Thank you, Senator.
@chrislhayes ethics? eeeethics? We don need no steenking ethics.
@TWalk, Approve them all! They'll be terrible and corrupt. It will sink Trump and maybe get Kushner jailed.
Let's hold this up until 'we find out what the hell is going on!"
You should also demand that Mitch McConnell live by what he said about Obama's nominees in 2009, with #No_Deflection_Allowed.
@chrislhayes So first Trump is pilloried in media for not selecting nominees fast but when selected now you want to delay?
THANK YOU!
@chrislhayes was Hillary Clinton required to disclose for her confirmation hearing? How did you miss that Foundation scam?
Thank you.
Yes to transparency!
@SenateMajLdr needs to use the same rules he insisted on in 2009. Why are there 2 sets of rules? HYPOCRISY
now we understand why the GOP was so eager to dismantle the ethics committee
.@SenBlumenthal @NPR_Dezign 

Where is the financial disclosure on certain #nicotine becoming #tobacco?
Thank you for standing up for fairness @SenBlumenthal !
changing rules and regulations new normal #
Thank you. I hope more of your peers do the same.
Thanks. Make them play on equal terms.
thank you! Please do your best 2keep this craziness n check until 2018. I promise we will get 2polls give houses back 2 Dems
Thank you I agree#
send him his own letter back
thank you!
Thank you!
Please just focus on Sessions and Price.
@AndyRichter Same should go for the President too. Just sayin'.
Even BETTER. Why not have a TIMEOUT on allowing a pathologic LIAR/NARCISSIST into our WH? WTH happened w/ our election? (O_O)
thank you!
thank you, but that'll make McConnell's chins wobble. And nothing.
how far do you think that will go? @realDonaldTrump has violated constitutional and Federal Law, 18 USC @ 2381  Art III sec.3
@CHHolte No representation without taxation
McConnell is so full of it.
So put a hold on each one! Simple solution!
@chrislhayes Is this really sustainable, is is something other than Political Grandstanding?
This simple statement is predict for hold on all nominees. #cloture
thank you, Senator.
stand against these corrupt appointments & don't fold!
Nor President elect for that matter.
#theRESISTANCE Can you be our Senator out here in Kansas? We need one (2 actually) with a spine...
Thank You Senator.
thank you! @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @SenFranken @KamalaHarris @SenSanders @SenFeinstein @SenReed @SenWhitehouse
