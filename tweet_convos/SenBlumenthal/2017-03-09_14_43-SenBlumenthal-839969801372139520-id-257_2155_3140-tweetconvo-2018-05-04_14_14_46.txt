How Senatorial of you..No class and no gravitas ever seems to come from. @SenBlumenthal , most entrenched ideologue ever fr #connecticut Sad
But the guy gutting the State Dept per Putin's orders and diminishing America's influence in the world is classy!
sure, you just keep on believing that, make sure that tin foil hat has a latch that fits you
Comey time.  Time to wakey wakey.

That straight jacket should be Orange.

Much better but still not quite Orange enough.  
Can't do much better because of the underlying coloring. Did my best w/ this one. :-)
Once again... I'm just super HAPPY that I voted against Primary Election Fraud Hillary and Trump won. :-) @SenBlumenthal @raymond_shelley
one f'd up indivual you are! Proud of that r ya? Great, just great...
Me? I'm not dem. I'm just human . No need for rudeness.
No need for defending Election Fraud Democrats. Get a Clue @raymond_shelley @MegRichly @SenBlumenthal
whoever they are..I don't have a clue..you are correct.
Don't forget Trump has been sued many times and has testified many times. Probably accustomed to be questioned under oath.
Also... That "When they go low.." bullshit does not apply to Nazi, fascists, autocrats and authoritarians. Allowed to punch.
When they go low, we wipe the ground w/ them. High road doesn't win elections! @SenBlumenthal
you can't bargain with merchants of those things because they don't care about you're high ground. It means nothing
Was never a fan of, "when they go low we go high". Politics is a dirty business & you have to fight w/ ! @SenBlumenthal
to authoritarianism. Much faster than the Nazi by my understanding.
We're in dire straights. IC de-fanged; crazy ppl can buy guns. Russia own us if we don't stop this NOW! @SenBlumenthal
#Impeach #Arrest #LockHimUp
Get a life, get an agenda, get busy for people. #ridiculous

@nytimes
Richard No one is Listening! your old and senile! Haha just Shut Up!
well said
I hope so!
@Jackymax @nytimes As soon as Trumpty is out of office, maybe sooner, all those sexual harassment suits will engage.
NY Times and @SenBlumenthal have alot in common both trade in #FAKENEWS #LIED #
dickblumenthalsucks.it
Let him keep talking/tweeting, the hole only gets deeper. He's not very smart, so he can hang himself on his own petard.
dt will just fire them.
@THC1 oh, & ANYTHING!!! you're gonna say WILL!!! be used against YOU!!!!!!!!
However please use a lawyer who isn't a co-defendant. Thank you. @MichaelCohen212
LOL ! Cohen you are especially FUBARED since Louise tracked all your flights to RUS n Ukraine
@realDonaldTrump That's what I am talking about Rich
He is incapable of silence.
That's because they can not comment on any investigation. Open or non existent.
@just_old_joe @nytimes ...Mr Blumenthal you are like a dog with out a leash... wisen up
...Lawyer time for sure
Sen Blumenthal, justice dept is hardly where my trust lays. sessions comments about #BlackLivesMatter? excuse me?
He better be and they'd better do it fast before he finds a way to get rid of the rest of them.
several. I hear Cohen needs a new gig.
Is this really you!THANK YOU 4 this tweet!Trump thinks he&his staff are abovethelaw;Justice not protected by us,is denied 2us
what about Hillary Clinton....crickets
1.yes, he is and yipeee or 2.no, but we'll let u think he is or 3.just waiting until Pence is ready-not good either
@FerrariERA Articles of impeachment, Senator. Dems must demand action. No more speeches, TV spots, tweets. Force GOP hand.
Agree. Trump always projects when he is upset or cornered or found to be lying. Keep up the good work Senator!
@JerseyJeff_ @nytimes trump is too stupid and arrogant to remain silent.  He thinks he's an emperor.
@Roolbreaker1 Trumps lawyer is being investigated right now.
I hope they nail his ass! Stupid lying pig!
@blaha_b @nytimes He had better be investigated.
are we to think that pence and ryan's hands are clean in all this shit........
let it please be so. And let's keep paying attention to Rachel Maddow. She's (hopefully) the Woodward and Bernstein of 2017
Turnip is always lawyered up and he pays cash to get out of trouble. Not this time.
that's my Senator!!!  Please pursue the truth for us as you have been.  This administration has too many lies
@GoodwitchResist He will never exercise the 5th- unless his phone is taken away
#LOCKHIMUP
How is it that you seem to know things , before events happen. I'll wait for an arrest
@Mama_Liberal @nytimes Lol. As if this blowhard could ever remain silent for more than 30 seconds.
You are so right! Runs his mouth more than my 3 kids combined! 
translate "You bet your ass."
Show of hands, has anyone in the Trump admin NOT had contact with Russia . . . show of hands. . . anyone ?
Dear Senator Blumenthal,
re: "You have a right to remain silent."
Perfection..!
Keep up the good work.
can you hurry?  Asking for a country.
You and your pal Chris Murphy really need to stop with your obstruction of Trump and the people! You're fired!
My Senator is probably part of the coup, so I can't ask him. Richard Burr.
@elacs @nytimes Please get this Russian coup out of the GOVT. Daily they dismantle our democracy and Constitution.
I just hope that when that happens it will wipe the smirk off of his face and the rest of the #GOP
please say it is so!!
Keep up the pressure! There is a there there.
@DJTrumpresident @nytimes thank goodness  finally !
we all know how he looks in orange
the corruption is surreal
Trump towers has been tapped. How about Flynn and the Prez convo with Australia PM. Coincidence. I think not.
it's funny because it's true!
#ImpeachmentParty SOON!!
He may have the right but he doesn't have the ability.
Fingers crossed 
A host of attorneys is the only way Trump can dodge all the bullets!
If you want to begin your day with energy and enthusiasm, envision the day Trump is led away in handcuffs...
He'll need more than one.
We understand evidence must be irrefutable in this case, but these charlatans must be removed from office.
please be quick  America is fed up with this crap, we would like to go in with our lives.
@puppymnkey impeach & remove!
@puppymnkey maybe after 2018 if we survive until then and we regain control of the House and Senate
Why hasn't he been impeached yet?Liar
They're trying 2 keep #Pence clean.Awesome work by @RepCummings keeping his feet 2 fire
@ThreeTouchDowns @nytimes Too bad Cochran and Kardashian are no longer with us, boo hoo
Trump would have a unique experience for himself if he remained silent.
@DJTrumpresident @nytimes But please continue to Tweet so there is admissible evidence.
Very compelling evidence/coincidences that stink high 2 heaven put together by various @MSNBC hosts & I find frightening
You too have the right (if not the ability) to remain silent.  Would you ever consider being constructive in your comments?
You implications are unconscionable! Facts not fiction! Fake Narratives is unacceptable! Please be truthful
your a fraud and shouldn't talk!
Please get your head out of the sand!
@realDonaldTrump Heed the warning from the greatest Attorney General this country has ever produced.
You have that wrong Sen. Hillary should be read those rights and the number of Obama's staff next
@LeslieLee327 @nytimes Intelligence Community makes special request to fund training for BS sniffing dogs.
Good thing HIllary didn't win, her ties to Russia and other not so cool countries would really have kept you busy. Or not!
And I thought the president had a tweeting problem.
Do you legislate in DC or just spend your time trying to overthrow the government?
The house of swamp will come tumbling down. I hope very soon!!!!
@2020pleasehurry Please nail this SOB.
Trump has never been able to shut up. Never.
waterboard him!
not might he will he better start liquidating some of his billions if he in fact has billions
trump may have the right to remain silent, but he doesn't have the ability!  
should of told that to obamav
the walls are caving in.
Or maybe your candidate.
He must have believed your propaganda paper.
the worst part is we won't be any better off losing the clown and getting stuck with the fanatic
Quit with this BS. Get to work on fixing our healthcare insurance. Work together.
words matter, this supposed administration is just starting to recognize it
I hope they drag him out of the white house in handcuffs.
This is the best line yet
We've got to have a special independent prosecutor.  The links are there.  Flynn, Sessions, Manafort, Kisylak,  Kilimnik
GOP has to do the right thing.  Trump is an agent of Russia.  He's gutting the State Dept for Putin -- diminishing the U.S..
Lock him up!!!
We need to get Pence as well.  Pence is not stupid like Trump.  More dangerous.
AND the rest of the deplorables ASAP
let us not stoop to his level of rhetoric.
Oh, brother.  As soon as I saw it was a FAKE NEWS article, the eyes started rolling.  Dream on.
Don't worry, he has plenty of lawyers and lots of practice using them to screw everyone else.
@PrincessBravato @nytimes Alarming, but he has a legitimate insanity defense.
@miguel_nan @nytimes rofl! Trump may have the right to remain...lol...silent... Rofl...but lol... Oh forget it! Omlolol
Can we make him go away and never ever hear from him again????
@PrincessBravato and if u can't afford an attorney no one will be appointed for u
@TeamKCP @nytimes He will  say it's Obama's fault.
duh!!! A year from now he'll trip over his own ego and it'll still be Obama's fault.
@PrincessBravato @nytimes I play the music to Rocky as i re-read this yet again.
@PrincessBravato @nytimes No! No "right to remain silent" for President not yet charged who owes massive explanations.
YOU'D BEST PROVIDE HIM WITH THE S SECTION OF THE DICTIONARY SO HE CAN LOOK UP "SILENT". THE MAN'S NOT FAMILIAR W/THE WORD.
, can we hang him for Treason once he's convicted or are we going to give him a slap on the wrist after impeachment?
Watch MSNBC is putting the Trump/Russian connection together
@WomenG4Hillary Thank you for your continued work for CT.  Eileen from Norwich
@GaillevittGail @nytimes
Get him NOW!  Time is running out!

please do everything you can to save our country from this crook
@thereallisababy can't happen soon enough
if he ain't he needs to be and quickly please - for the sake of our country! OUR COUNTRY! NOT RF / USSR

@joolsrenee Oh, he so hates democracy and 'tradition'...what say we simply hang him without due process and undue delay?
it would be a win of investigation just gets him to be silent
@BonhoefferLives yeah he kind of went a little to far on his last tweeting rage. Lying false claims. Should have to pay
@Emeraldluxury @nytimes I hope it's a really bad lawyer
please lord let this be true
@BonhoefferLives They better be!
The ugly silence of the Trump administration throws a very sinister shadow over the whole thing.  Shine a bright light on it
Mogul, Entertainer, President, Spy.
The traitorous Quisling-in-Chief has to go.
Manafort, GRU?
Imagine my surprise.
Who was expecting them to do that? Seriously?
@Margaretherapy @nytimes oh trump will love this.  Countdown to tweet storm loaded with alternative facts.
@csd Sweet tweet Rich
@ManMet80 @nytimes  Are we finally at the point where what he says can and will be used against him in a court of law?
"if you can not afford an attorney, one will be provided to you " I think that is the way it goes, but time will tel
@tinaissa if i could like this more than once, I would
I'd love to hear why you didn't pursue the #failingfoundations in CT over 10 years ago.   got paid off.  #corrupt
yes yes yes... say it loud! @Rosie

"But the court shall sit in judgment & his [Trump's] dominion shall be taken away to be consumed & destroyed to the end."

Or you can do what you usually do, and talk and talk, tweet and lie. You are so much smarter than everyone else. Ask Bannon.
people used to respect the work of blumenthal.not anymore pure political puppet.too bad.
you quack like a duck
when they go low, we send them to Leavenworth.
Dick Vietnam seems to have taken its toll on you!!!
and don't think we won't taser your ass!!!
@MargieHagen #trumprussia #russiagate #resist
fingers crossed.
If you believe this to be true that remember no one elected in fraud gets to pick a supreme court justice
@softballscifi @nytimes stay focused Senator you are now an enemy of #Trumpland
Make it happen. Please?!!!
something is happening. Trump is sedated at the WH or Repubs have shut him down or his lying ass is scared.
I think we're at max 72 hours out from the NYT officially reporting that Trump is under counterintelligence investigation.
This too. And if it happens I think it could kill Trump with the GOP finally. Beginning of the end.
Sources: FBI investigation continues into 'odd' computer link between Russian bank and Trump Organization 
and anything you tweet might be used against you in a court of law! #resist #Trumprussia #russiagate
I LOVE YOU
this is serious
he s going  dowwwwwn.
the shit is about to hit the fan
wow
Sir,who is going to enforce the laws of our country?Lies,Russia,Emoluments,the elimination of the state department and EPA+++
In  your dreams you are do nothing as always , Grand standing to under mine this President
'You have the right to remain silent that'll be the day.  aha! get 45 on the stand and he'll crack like Jack!
nope. He will remember NOTHING! He has pulled this before in depositions.
Don't let colluision and anti American gov't ran by conspiracy nuts & russian agents become the norm. Get them out
If you impeach him for treason, can we make him pay back all the money he's profited from his official position.
already hidden offshore, i expect.
Beautiful.
Can I like this a million times?  #impeachtrump or #LOCKHIMUP #Trumprussia
I am working tirelessly to make sure you do not get reelected!!!
You are the ultimate in hypocrisy!!! We have intelligence agencies that are incompetent!!! Get your head out of the sand!!!
Good one, Senator! 
Yes!!!!  Get to the bottom of it!
And #Trump MAY just need an atty fr a btr school than WMUCLS, f/k/a #ThomasMCooleyLawSchool, rt up there w/#TrumpUniversity
