Yes, so they need to roll up their sleeves and get to work.
Their government is OUR government.
No not quite, their government is local leadership which is corrupt and inept.  We could annex them and make the number 51, and fix
Congress doesn’t want them to be 51!
Not just this congress. But decades.  Plus, Puerto Rican's have not wanted it in the past. They've voted no several times.  
States don’t get to choose to be part of the US without consent of Congress.
The PR problem is compounded by 3 factors, 1 poor financial status and poor infrastructure to begin with, 2 serious hurricane damage, 3 PR is not a state. The closest comparison is Katrina when 1800+ died, and many areas months unoccupied. So, get practical, Fed has no magic!
unfortunately Puerto Ricans we the wrong color.
Thank You Trump and the GOP have no care about Puerto Rico they are not white and not the 1 precent
Thank you, WAPO. The deaths occurring  now are on POTUS head. He doesn't care and has no shame. Since when do we leave Americans like this?

Fixed your headline: The inaction on the part of the current administration regarding Puerto Rico is entirely unacceptable, cruel, & racist.
There has been plenty of action.  What is. Unacceptable is the local leadership and the corruption in . Let's just annex it - make it # 51
Puerto Rico is in life-and-death circumstances from a natural disaster. We could so easily do more to help them survive.
We've done a lot, but efforts are hampered by poor local leadership, corruption, Third World infrastructure. Let's annex them and fix.
When Rita hit TX we were out of power for 4 weeks
What’s your point?
We have a Golden Opportunity to restore PR to an infrastructure showcase that would be the foundation for an economic rebirth.
And it would inspire the rest of this country! Coal is dead!
The parasite loves inflicting misery. He needs to be removed from office & news outlets should start the call.
Any major natural disaster takes time to recover from. fires in California, three hurricanes, Obamas hurricane Sandy --- all took time.
Surely WaPo has sent it’s newsroom to PR sans equipment, to help with the disaster...lest they be hypocrites
Yet the Pres wants to give tax cuts to the rich but we can't afford to rebuild PR. If we don't rebuild them how will they pay their debt?
It wouldn’t take that much.
Except “the right” runs everything right now! Right into the ground.
Not 2 Trump & his followers, these are non-white people looking 4 a handout again!
PR was in shambles before the storm&will need a lot of help.It’s also clear that many on this thread think gov is the answer2everything
This is why we should just annex PR and make it a state.  We'd fix the infrastructure and handle the corrupt local leadership.
Why do only Puerto Ricans matter?  What about the people from Barbuda, St Barths, St. Martin, Turks and Caicos, Cuba, Dominica, and Guadeloupe?  Your headlines don't include their suffering?
This is one of the most well written pieces regarding Puerto Rico I have read! Thank you!

#unidosporpuertorico
Trump needs to DO HIS JOB. What a pathetic loser.
And yet, we continue to accept these outrages.
Where’s that cowardly governor?
Don’t you mean the #FakePresident?
We have a government that will not take care of its own people. Shameful! How low the US has been pulled by @realDonTrump45 !
@POTUS #FakePresident #Liar #impeach #treason #Guantanamo
This amounts to genocide from our racist POTUS. Welcome to his sick world.
It isn’t acceptable. But neither is a President who doesn’t know PR is part of America! #FakePresident #liar #impeach
Why should trump care about PR? His base doesn't care. PR has no electoral votes. trump's thick, black heart rarely beats.
Start doing something- anything for yourself rather than sitting and waiting.
I agree!
This is not how you treat our fellow Americans! DO YOUR JOB TRUMP!!
We outline possible paths to #rebuildpuertorico
Inexcusable that Trump & Co. have refused to help these AMERICAN CITIZENS !!!
#PuertoRicoGenocide
Puerto Rico needs to become the 51st state when this catastrophe is cleaned up if they want to end their second class treatment.
Those who support the current territorial status (aka "ELA"/"commonwealth") are going to have to suck it up and get over it. The ELA is dead
No supposed benefits of the status quo can outweigh the benefits that come with having 2 senators and 4 congressmen & the presidential vote.
Socialism has its consequences.
They're Puerto Ricans, not Americans -- am I right, Trump family? @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @POTUS
.@JeffBezos needs to respond to @rosemcgowan
It's TERRIFYING.    Who said "Do unto others as you would have them Do Unto You   ?"        Donald Trump ^ his cabinet NEED TO GO --- NOW
Sorry, evangelicals have removed that part of the Bible in favor of more OT hate.

It shows what used to the normal before WWII as Puerto Rico is still a colony where citizens are cash tax machines.
It is acceptable2Trump&his greedy GOP slicing chunks of healthcare from American lives Shame

It will continue for the lack of cooperation between both governments and their agencies
So is the the yellow journalism of the WP.
genocide by another name
Understand this is TERRIBLE and local...But the entire WORLD is talking UNESCO WITHDRAWAL!!!! Please cover!
But Sharyl "Obama deleted my document" Attkison says it's PR's own fault
So why isn’t @realDonaldTrump responding?  These are Americans in PR. #PatientAdvocacy
@GOP @SenBobCorker @SpeakerRyan The people will remember hurt and suffering u allow to happen. You all watch & do nothing.
What a bunch of crap over 10,000 FEMA & US military there.. Their national guard still partially a no show.. was a disaster before..not much internal initiative compared to Houston
Dock workers on protest n wouldn't unload ships cuz they want more pay  so sad wish they'd all pull together get Puerto Rico safe nthan b4!
Not true. Don't believe bad sources.
The misery of Puerto Rico is a sign of things to come in the continental US under a Trump presidency.
We all agree! Can you please tell us how much money is @amazon and @JeffBezos donating to the effort to save and rebuild?
You are disgusting, George. What a waste of skin.
What can we do? I don't have infinite funds. I can't take time off work. But I want to help. What can I do? Call my congresscritter??
Give what you can. Research charities. I give to Heart to Heart International. Only a suggestion. Every small amount matters!
Opinion.... No one at your organization is capable of wiping their ass with a bed sheet...
Goes against the oath that was taken. #25Ammendment
So, why do you offer a plan to completely rebuild what was already a dilapidated power grid for an entire state...Huh??? Listening???
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
Tell mother nature how it is unacceptable.
