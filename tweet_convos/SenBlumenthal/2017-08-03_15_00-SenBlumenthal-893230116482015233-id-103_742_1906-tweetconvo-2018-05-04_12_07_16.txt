Special Counsel Mueller impanels Washington grand jury in Russia probe http://on.wsj.com/2u5bpCw 
Specter of Presidential action to stop or stymie criminal investigation makes safeguarding the special counsel urgently necessary.
Congress must act ASAP to avoid potential constitutional crisis raised by Trump's ominous, ongoing threats of improperly firing Mueller.
at least Richard, you'll be on the right side on the record...many GOPs will suffer terribly in '18/'20...TU for #Resisting
Why not just say the owners want mueller to do it so it will be done. All hail the state, government is god, obey consume and sleep!
Or you can call them racist that works good too
When people fear govt there is tyranny. When govt fears the people there is liberty. See you at the polls scumbag. It is time end DNC regime
You and the screw ball Maxine Waters >>> perfect together!
You hack , you're the last POS that should be weighing in on this. You're a liar and a cheat !
Yes it is. This country will blow up if he tries to fire Mueller. We just need to let the truth come out and the process continue.
The truth ?? How can the the truth come out when Mueller has appointed Clinton supporters and Clinton lawyers. The fix is in . Very unfair.
Here you go with your Grandstanding BS AGAIN. you should do your best to get your head out your ass and start supporting the president
Majority of all Americans are in agreement with you! Just name it..what can we citizens do to assist?
Educate yourself, for starters.
Yeah
Get him Blumenthal... you're a good person. Now he's coming for you. Help bury him with evidence. Get him out of office
and the leaks continue...

Hey tricky Dick...

Shouldn't the proceedings of this grand jury be SECRET?
Absolutely agree Sen Blumenthal. (PS= many of us are on YOUR side!)
We need you all more than ever.  You're the only ones protecting us from this WH. He cannot be trusted. He lies every other breathe.
Need an Amendment to take away Presidential Powers Why don't you start working on that?
What happens when they go after the dnc ,clintons, lynch,and the rest of you terds
Exactly what steam do you think Mueller is gathering. It's all smoke and mirrors once again. Hillary's crime are right in plain sight. SEE!!
It appears Mueller is a dirty cop just like Comey.
What ever the outcome, please make it sooner than later.  The 2018 election is upon us  this rhetoric is going on to long!
Democrats leading the way obstruction against investigation senator Blumenthal and Senator Murphy Leading The Way of obstruction
Unless they come up with a Veto Proof Bill, it will be DOA.
Does people know that mass media is part of the CIA? When the goverment fears the people there is freedom let freedom finally come!
Says the Senator whose state rest areas are only open 8:30 to 3:30 then taxpayers have to use a stinky porta potty.
This is a witch hunt! It's outrageous! Republicans should be supporting President Trump instead of supporting Mueller! Shame on them!
Its's all not b/c he did anything wrong, it's just b/c you don't want him as @POTUS. That's an attack on democracy. He was duly elected.
Looking at Trump finances going back years before he was even a candidate is over the top ridiculous. That shit needs to stop now.
wife has furlough days, mortgage up with taxes every year, make less as a nurse annually due to Medicaid cuts. Can u help ct? Or just tweet?
Surely any nuthead can see it's a set up
The American people will not allow this interference.
A Bill should also be introduced to prevent the president from firing the head of any of the intelligence agencies without good cause.
White Anglo-Saxons are very brutal. You haven't seen what they can do when provoked. Be very careful here republicans...it's time to defend
What a world we live in where the politicians have to protect us from the mad king.

8) Unless Mueller 'not fire' bill becomes an Independent Counsel re-enact bill
45 will go free no matter what he did & we won't hear or know
@realDonaldTrump AND WILL HE STUFF THE JURY WITH DEMONIC CRATS LIKE HIS PANEL..
Warning to Deep State Republicans and Democrats, you can bet you are going to have some big surprises on next Election Day!!!!!
All these corrupt dirty Senators need to be fired ASAP. Or Arrest them LOCK THEM ALL UP along with Hillary,Comey,Lynch,etc
clowns. Sanction president and now this. But can't do tax reform or Obamacare no wonder y'all approval low hate high
Special council investigation Trump/Russia is the swamps years long taxpayer funded opposition research for the 2020 election at our expense

Let the investigation finish,  the country moves on, guilty - has to go. To me it seems simple.

Wow!  Do we have the biggest, lying, stealing, snake, ever in office??!!  I used to look up to presidents, not anymore
All this because the FAKE president, is guilty as hell!!!
What exactly is the criminal statute Mueller is seeking to enforce??? #Mueller
It's a shame you aren't equally concerned w/ "possible political interference" of team Mueller has assembled & his own #ConflictOfInterest
Your a disservice to Connecticut and the American People! You Leach!
@SenBlumenthal is a LIAR. He should not represent anyone. Even NY Times reported his fabrications. War hero BS.  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18blumenthal.html?pagewanted=all …
If he doesn't prosecute Clinton, then we're no longer a nation of Laws. But with Clinton lawyers in D.C., Mueller is a Clinton Stooge
Lots of one follower pro Trump bots on this thread. Russians working over time on this one. #MuellerGrandJury #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Tell me something I don't know #MuellerGrandJury #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #ComeyFiring #Flynn
Thank you Senator. Please get this bill through before Trump fires him.
What do you people want out of this witch hunt? You trying to tear the country to pieces? The people voted live with it!
We're with you Senator! #BulletproofMueller
(2)to protect an out of control witch hunt..hunter's...and then go on vacation for a month...disgusting bunch ..vote em all out
The same Senators who couldn't get a healthcare bill for the American people...and didn't hold Obama, Clinton,Holder acct...has time to
Equally important is Mueller's hard-won rock-solidified lately job security, in addition to unlimited resources...
Once again you should be prepared to be disappointed
Yeah lets start with this guy Dick !
There you go again misleading people with your big words....
Another unconstitutional thing our congress is trying to do. They don't know anything. They're pathetic...go repeal Obamacare, u PROMISED!!!
63 mil Trump supporters want Mueller FIRED and you will create a War in America if you allow Mueller to corrupt the Justice System!
The congress caused the crisis, how bats ass blind are you
Yes!
SO CLOSE!!! lol #neverhappen
A new, 3rd Party, will rise from the ashes. You will destroy this democracy
28 CFR 600.7
CT deserves better.  This has become an obsession with you when they are many more pressing issues that need addressing.
You should know about protection. Like the lie you told about your service during the Vietnam War!
Or Trump's lie to avoid service?
Pres. had nothing to do with the condition CT is in.  This Investigation is the SWAMP.  Please FOCUS on what matters to CT...Bring Us JOBS!
Blumenthal doesn't care about small biz in CT, that's why businesses are leaving CT.
@WSJ Muller is on clinton crime family payroll! Our independent counsel will now begin, bama,hill,rice,lynch,comey!
Just shut up and see how things progress
Yes! Please @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein @SenatorCardin @SenateDems @SenWarren @SenFranken This needs to happen ASAP! 
#ProtectMuellerAgainstPolonium
What is Polonium?
Russian favorite poison.
I think it is the one that causes the heart attacks, but not 100% sure.
No its a radioactive substance. Years ago I watched a man slowly die from Russian agents slipping it into his cup of tea in a London hotel 1
Thank you for the info. I knew it was fatally toxic, radioactive.  Wasn't sure if it invoked a cardiac response.
I have never heard of it. I have dealt more w/ arsenic
Don't worry. The Resistance is ready to take to the streets.
Indeed
Getting lots of tweets from Trumpsters asking for Mueller's firing....nasty nasty tweets...please do all you can to secure Mueller
Mueller is far from impartial, one reason it looks like a witch hunt.
Highly doubtful....
Meanwhile, in the non-Russia hysteria world:
Golly, Dick do you not know that a GJ is needed for subpoenas, witness depositions, etc? Don't get too excited yet.
