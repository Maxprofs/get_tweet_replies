please urge them more
Dangerous Cruel & unacceptable!!!
Thank you!
We also needs answers about these sustained reports of planes spraying something on protesters.
@UN @amnesty @POTUS @Pontifex @RobertKennedyJr @realDonaldTrump There were atrocities committed  #NoDAPL
Thank you. Now please ask Obama why he isn't taking action. @TheJusticeDept
TY so much for writing this. It is such a disgrace that this is happening once again to the Native Americans
@lionheart_erin @TheJusticeDept Yes I 2nd this
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept stop life because you lost is NOT RIGHT.  You get equal to what you give
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept Trump wants to water board again, isn't this similar?
stop by a local protest!  This was yesterday in Torrington
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept disagree, people need to get out of the way of progress
.@SenBlumenthal Please send DOJ a letter Mr. Blumenthal, as other brave Senators have done @TheJusticeDept
encourage the criminal protesters to leave ND and restore peace
Protesting peacefully is now a crime?
Thank you @SenBlumenthal calling on the  @TheJusticeDept to intervene
please continue to urge for an end to this horrible injustice.
You should do more than "urge."
I'm afraid the only hope for stopping this is us going up there and stopping them
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept maybe if these peaceful protesters should ask #AmmondBundy to join protest, no consequences then
you're misinformed. Protesters lit a bridge on fire, broke barricades and have gone into Bismarck trying to shutdown roads.
You sir are the one who is misinformed. Your troll hat is showing. Now run along
I never run from the truth. Jump in your car and drive up there this weekend. It's a 20 hr drive for you.
You can't run from what you can't find
and what is the response??? A deadline December 5th. Bullshit.
Time for the Senate to hold a hearing on treaty rights.
@McDermottMike1 @TheJusticeDept Corrupt intl banks, fossil fuel executives & politicians give back our sovereignty now!
thank you!
@Alyssa_Milano @TheJusticeDept I agrre! Federal govt stop this and fix it!!!!!!!
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept I have friends up there.  This is a Police Riot,  that is the national emergency.
@sensanders @SenJeffMerkley THANK YOU for #StandingWithStandingRock & Water Protectors. Stop #DAPL Violence! @thejusticedept
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept I'm a trump supporter and I approve this message
@jeffkessock @TheJusticeDept Thank you @SenBlumenthal for speaking up on behalf of #NoDAPL.
Ummm... you mean the dept run by @LorettaLynch? Seriously, like @EricHolder she will do ZIP for the people!
Cruel and unusual punishment = Constitutional violation. Not to mention bypassing due process.
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157781601320357&id=704800356 …
thank you for standing up for indigenous people. Stealing their land & putting in a pipeline is as egregious.
Bull! When protests turn to riots that destroy expensive vehicles, rioters deserve being sprayed!
Thank you, @SenBlumenthal . I hope @TheJusticeDept heeds your advice.
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept thank you
thank you for standing and adding your voice.
#NoDAPL
They're not going to. The justice department sold us out when pardoned #Hillary
Thank you Sen. Blumenthal. The more elected officials that stand up against this police brutality, the better
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept it's another version of water boarding.
DOJ? You must be kidding. Shes,too busy plotting insurrection to in talk Hillary. They are using dupes
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept and perhaps The President??
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept  - STOP them oil companies! Native Americans deserve better!
please. Why is this going on?
.@SenBlumenthal Thank you Senator Blumenthal. We would all appreciate it very much if you went to Standing Rock. @Brokenf8 @TheJusticeDept
Call the Gov of ND, Jack Dalrymple. Let him know that his mistreatment of citizens is intolerable. 701-328-2200
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept Less urging, more demanding . Your a US Senator. You have a platform for  a reason. Use it.
can ask @POTUS for a meeting and if he can save standingRock so he can stop the pileline tell him some one lost a arm !!!!!!
Justice Department, Please do your job! Why are you sitting by? People are being abused!  Affluent Entities R being appeased.
Thank you for #StandingwithStandingRock In 2014, @BarackObama made a promise to have their backs
I've been there n know what's going on 1st hand, you ppl speaking up for the pipeline  r painfully uninformed
@SenSanders  tip of the  to you senator
Thank you Sen Blumenthal for speaking out against this atrocity!
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept You think? I mean months have gone by, no media, it's like no one gives a shit abt ppl or water.
Where is @POTUS in this?  He's still the president until January.  He needs to act.
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept thank you sir for being one of the few to speak up about this!
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept Please Please Please help your citizens. This is inhumane.
no joke. it's sad it even has to be said.
@SenSanders  can you phone @POTUS  and ask him to stop it
you can thank Obama's team for that, he could stop that immediately.
Senator Blumenthal and Senator Sanders, we need more elected officials like you.
Thank you, Senator!
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept don't count on Obama. Company man doing corporate neoliberal bidding. Won't pardon Peltier also.
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept Thank you, Senator!! DOJ, stop these atrocities being done to our water protectors! #NoDAPL
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept you blame them when you jump in front of a speeding car.. how about you move.. or get more of it
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept Is this the waterboard alternative?
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept quickly B4 Trump takes office-American Natives won't be treated fairly under him
multiple pipes already running through the area in question.
water wasn't used as a surprise. they were warned and continued to stay.
it's not a gov. project, it's a private industries project &not their land idiot
