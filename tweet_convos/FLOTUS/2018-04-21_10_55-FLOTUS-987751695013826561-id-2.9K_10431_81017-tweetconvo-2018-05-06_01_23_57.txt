You are the most gracious and beautiful first lady. Praying daily for you and the president daily
He needs all the prayers he can get
...and thoughts as well. He has so few that are worth a shit.
You win! So much winning
Melania smiling because she is not having to sit next to pervy the rapist Clinton! She knows Okenya swings another way....safe zone! Or she knows they are all getting their a*ses beat by her husband. I wld smile too! #Winning #KAG
Well done & classy Melania  
RIP BB
Mooches face!  Omg!!  She’s mad!
His nuts itch.
Michael always looks constipated. Seriously though, I would smile too because @POTUS is still their President! 
Trump is just peachy!
It Touched My Heart That You Took Staffers With You To Pay Respects
You're truly an inspiration as a person as well as @Flotus - you represent us with extraordinary style, class and dignity!

Your respect counts. What was with your husband? Did you have a good time with the Obamas? Nice to see you happy again.
Amen to that First Lady!
Thank you for attending
Beautiful Melania! 
Melania you are a class act! I just love you!
Glad you were there to pay your respects. 
You were amazing and made us proud, as always!
Thank you for representing our country as our beautiful and gracious First Lady.
Hopefully you will stand up to your husband and do what’s right for the country. It is time.
Your a gracious first lady, may God bless you and your family always!
Elegance, dignity, grace, beauty, intelligence and fortitude. @FLOTUS you are the consummate First Lady and we are very proud!

#FIRSTLADYBARBARABUSH
You are so beautiful and lovely
You need a husband that gives you respect and real love
You looked so happy with a REAL man today.
You looked gorgeous today. You are a class act lady.
You are always gracious!
Do you ever wish you weren’t a Trump? The money can’t be that good surely.
So true Col. Trump just looks way out of his depth in everything he does.
Excellent Mrs Trump . You're the best . Love & hugs
Thank you for being such an awesome First Lady for our great country.
CLASS ACT ALL THE WAY
You are wonderful,  we love you 
It was a beautiful event for a wonderful woman.
So Much CLASS !!!
It was very kind of you to take those who worked  for the Bush's to Barbara Bush's funeral.  I am sure they appreciated it.
She was a strong woman.  Thank you for representing us.
You are such a gracious & kind lady...bless you much!
You're a classy & forgiving lady, Melania!  Barbara Bush was nice to corrupt HRC & her rapist & sexual harassing husband, Bill,.....while treating your husband & our great POTUS with disdain just because he beat her son in the 2016 Rep. primary. The Bushes have disappointed me!
Melania, I initially had doubts about your role as First Lady. So glad, I was wrong. You have manage to keep the balance and faith of the WH with your lovely and kind personality. I am thrilled you present the women of the US. Thank you . Keep up the good work . María


This is an amazing woman. The classiest First Lady in a very long time.
We are so proud of our FLOTUS! 
Dignity
Grace
Love! 
God bless you always!
You are a very gracious First Lady
Thank you for your integrity and grace
I love @FLOTUS she’s a gem and not nearly given enough credit as the First Lady. She’s amazing. 
Thanks for paying your respects, it could not have been easy to be in the same room with people who have tried to take down your husband/our President.  It goes to show how classy & full of integrity you are as our Firsr Lady.  You make us proud!  
My Dear First Lady, 
It was so nice of you to take some of the White House staff with you to Houston for the funeral to honor another great First Lady.  Your kindness, thoughtfulness and Christian compassion is so admirable.  For many-many of us, I say Thank You !
we could ALL learn from @FLOTUS . #somuchgrace
SPEAKING AS A TRUE FLOTUS 
AWESOME class act
Happy Birthday, Flotus!! You make us very proud!!
Our elegant 1st lady privately took 2 from the White House staff from the Bush years. What a giving and elegant 1st lady we have. Thank you for all the gifts you have given to many. Openly and without fanfare.
First Lady Melania Trump you again showed America your class and charm. First Lady Trump showed compassion and respect for the Bush family despite their chilly relationship with the President. It takes fortitude and class to represent our nation without prejudice. Thank you
You are amazing. After everything those people have done to you and your beautiful family, you walk in with your head held high and a beautiful smile. Thank you
@FLOTUS Melania continues to be a strong,  compassionate and courageous example for American women to follow.
And, she does it with such grace.
Much loved by the American people.
As usual you were the best Thank You
Another classy First Lady

We love you Melania,you are a very special lady,keep up the good work.
THANKYOU FOR REPRESENTING US MELANIA
Nice 
You looked happier sitting next to Obama than you ever look in the presence of your vile husband. I hope you recognize the class & grace Barack & Michelle has repeatedly extended you after you participated in your husband’s hateful birthirism. You could learn a lot from them.
You are very gracious and a wonderful first Lady!
And thank you dear First Lady.
It was a beautiful service. It was an honor having you in our City. We loved our Barbara very much. GOD BLESS.

ི
First Lady. Salute You.

God bless you, Melania! True class having to sit by Obama. Respect for our country & the former first lady. Thank you
Your husband should’ve been there too
Crazy how that’s not even talked about.
He’s disgraceful and so is his whole presidency
Thank you. Finally a first lady we can be proud of!...
Malania thank you for always having kind words and a caring heart, we are lucky to have a beautiful, elegant and fearless @FLOTUS representing our Country

You and your family are are a Blessing from God

 #WeThePeople apologize for the ignorance of #Dems
Spilling the beans on DT would be a great service to our country.
, I must agree with you though!!
You did an outstanding job.  When you and President Obama started chatting and you started smiling, that was great.
Good job!
You are a sweet soul. I am sorry you were subjected to the Hildebeast and the BHOs again. We had you wrapped in prayer
Classy, and fearless
First Lady and I respect you and appreciate you intellect and style.  Hope you are happy even though you have to take the undeserved Hate. So proud of you and pray for you to be able to endure the pressure of being First Lady.
Amen First Lady M.
We love you Melanie!!!
Texas is honored to have you here
Our state will be the last Bastian of freedom in the world. Thanks to the President and you freedom remains
Wonderful caring First Lady
Praying for you, your precious family and staff today!
Dear First Lady, you were outstanding!
You are an honorable first lady. Keep up the good work.
Thank you. Your kind words are greatly appreciated.
There’s not many things to be proud coming out of this administration...but I must admit that I admired your respect, poise, and class at Barbara Bush funeral. You did good...better than your husband ever would.
love this first lady!! so dignified and a fantastic first lady!
Thank you always for your kind words. America is proud to have you as First Lady of USA. God be bless you and President and family.
If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing! All you hateful trolls seem to be able to do is bestow negativity into everything you encounter! @FLOTUS, you are such a great woman! In the midst of a total shit storm against @realDonaldTrump, you stand w/ Distinction & Grace! 
You are the best I’ll be praying for the three of you may the almighty be with you always.
You represented well.
What was it like to be surrounded by real Presidents who have class, dignity and grace & don’t tweet childish names towards their adversaries? What was it like to be around strong women, who led with honor and values? How do you stand by that lunatic we currently have in the WH?
Thank you. I apologize for the ignorance of others. Those so willing to except immigrants who stand for immigrants mock your accent. We The People appreciate you. Your intelligent and represent us beautifully. Your proof of grace & patience is loved.
Beautifully said!
Your a sweet lady.

 @POTUS you have less than 2 hours to help save baby #AlfieEvans . Please call Theresa or the Queen . Please please please @FLOTUS https://twitter.com/teresahantschke/status/988336918982250496 …
Thank you for going and for the kindness to bring along WH staff members who worked for the Bushes. RIP to the wonderful Barbara Bush.
You’re a class act & a beautiful First Lady!
So proud of our beautiful, smart and gracious FLOTUS
You are such a beautiful woman. Stay strong
I am so proud of you Melania! You are a first class  representative of what a FLOTUS should be. You showed what is really important at the funeral of Barbara Bush. You put aside all party lines, were kind, gracious and polite to all. You deserve much praise. I applaud you!
Thank you and God bless you!
Thank you for representing The US in this sad time!
WE LOVE YOU, @FLOTUS. You grace every occasion with your presence.
Melania, showed grace and dignity at these services and seated with the other former presidents and first ladies.
Your beauty is only exceeded by your graciousness...you make us all proud!
Good job flotus!
So nice to have a classy , beautiful First Lady back im WH.
Thank you for conducting yourself as @FLOTUS. It was Lovely to see you have a real genuine smile in a very long time, Thank you for paying your respects to former #FLOTUSBarbaraBush. I am not a fan of the man you married, But you carried yourself with poise & class. Thank You.
I'm surprised that the moron husband let her go, I don't think he lets her get involved in anything because he is afraid she would embarrass him and I kind of feel sorry for her
We all love you keep up the good work MAGA
Thank you for going!


Watching her celebration of life today was like reading a book. A beautiful beginning, middle and end.
Amen! Keep doing your thing no matter how crazy things get.  Pray/tell God your complaint (after acknowledging him of course).Tell Him everything-he already knows (you should talk to him out loud-in privacy of course- scream, holler, cry, whatever is on your heart.
Surrender all!
God bless you  Barbara 

FLOTUS  Bush . . .  your forever in my heart 
Jackson in Tennessee  
You guys should come to Alaska, and visit one of the last remaining blockbusters 
Mrs Trump, FLOTUS, you are one of the finest women walking the planet right now, and you are a remarkable woman; you have my deepest admiration!
Our Flotus you r such a wonderful woman mother & most of all First Lady. Thank you!
Well said!

Thanks for leaving your gasbag husband at the golf course
Lady Melania is truly a class act! #MAGA
Thank you Flotus for representing the White House with grace and compassion. Americans love you. 
So you'll have your husband stop bullying them and calling them childish names?
Obama, tho! Amiright?
Change your last name
Glad you could make it
Trump has his cronies making the Sunday talk show rounds
What did President Obama say that made you smile?
It was the AMERICAN PPL's honor to have you represent us mam...#MELANIA#CLASS
You represented our country beautifully and displayed incredible grace.
Thank you for representing all of us.
You are Amazing, America is so proud you are our FLOTUS
Haters will hate and do what they do best, bully.  As far as designers that don't want to dress you...tricks on them, you could wear a paper sack and still look better than in anything they design.  Always classy Mrs. Trump
You looked wonderful and relaxed that day. Thank you Melania for representing us. God bless you and may every place your foot treads upon may it be blessed.
Beautifully said.  Thank you!
How did U feel sitting next to the President & First Lady, KNOWING that your hole husband ordered 2 PROSTITUTES to PEE ON EACH OTHER in the SAME BED they slept in at in THEIR OFFICIAL visit to Russia?
My very liberal friends and colleagues and I are incredibly impressed by your exquisite graciousness as our #FirstLady.
I guess  we can take it from your tweet that you don’t speak for your husband in that same regard
Thank you for representing the nation with class
re: Melania at Funeral;
   In her attendance, she raised the bar for the honorable Barbara Bush.
   Barbara is proud in heaven.
I'm happy you had a good time.
@ponyexpress_gsc America's most eloquent #FLOTUS & You can't #TRUMP THAT! Original #MAGA Video
Lovely sentiment. Now blink twice if you want us to get you out of there.

Sweet of you to attend the funeral mam! May Mrs. Bush rest in peace! Thoughts and Prayers are with the Bush family!
Birther.
A wonderful woman and she was a great First Lady, as you are also.
You are a great First Lady with excellent class and upbringing.  Please hang in there against the Swamp, Alligators and news media!
thank you for being there. it's awesome to see everyone come together to honor a special lady
It's awesome
A beloved and honorable family!
Thanks for honoring, representing, and being there for Americans 
Melania, you are one classy lady. America is very proud of you and so glad your our first lady..I pray for our President and you to grow stronger together and your love overcome all challenges.
can i just ask who wrote this for you? who’s writing for you?
It was such an honor to see you, beautiful Melania, and the other dignitaries there, @FLOTUS Trump. The funeral service for Barbara Bush was simply honorable and graceful. Barbara Bush was such a lovely, gracious, and remarkable First Lady.
I'm sure they didn't want you there.
Thank you for being a gracious first lady in all circumstances.
Thank you for the wonderful respect you showed, to a previous First Lady and as a representative of the American people!!! I’m so sorry you were alone. I would’ve gone with to sit between you and BO!!!! Thank you
Beautiful you look happy. Continued prayers for the Bush family.
Mrs Trump I am so proud to have you as our First Lady. You are a beautiful lady inside and out. Please continue to be the classy and Sophisticated woman you are. #MAGA
Some one to strive to become. Hopefully you took notes.
We finally saw you smile. Obama has that way, we all smile. Time away from your captor is time well spent. Your presence at our former First Lady’s funeral was noted by all. #freemelania#dumptrump
Thank you!

Trump promoted a racist “birther” conspiracy questioning Obama’s legitimacy. Melania stood by her husband’s insanity & parroted Trump’s stupid birther claim. And here is Obama being gracious to her. Say whatever the…
Dear Melania Trump,
You shouldn't have attended.  You are complicit with your statements and actions, and yet they treated you with RESPECT.  The Media is applauding.  But, you don't deserve a pass or sympathy from the taxpayers of America. #SundayMorning
Class!
Beautiful picture
Meanwhile our @POTUS working 24/7 for the best of the country.   Liberal leftys cant accept that. Viva our POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA 
Our First Lady is gorgeous!!! Thank You Melania! .
You're such a Class Act !
So proud to have you as Our @FLOTUS 
We are with you, my dear! #FreeMelaniaNOW
Barbara Bush has class. She showed compassion, tolerance, and the ability to change with times. She deserved her popularity. How things have changed!
Thank you for your work for the American people! Mrs First Lady 
Class
Thank you so much for coming.  Much appreciated.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush Family as well and I so wish I could of met them as in my business I had heard so many great things and my boss at the time couldn’t wait for me to meet them before his unexpected death in flight!
You deserve all praise you are a better person than most........
Melania’s husband abandoned her, so, even though she promoted the racist birther conspiracy, Obama sat next to her. 

He is pure class.

#BarbaraBushFuneral
So much more class than President Trump!
