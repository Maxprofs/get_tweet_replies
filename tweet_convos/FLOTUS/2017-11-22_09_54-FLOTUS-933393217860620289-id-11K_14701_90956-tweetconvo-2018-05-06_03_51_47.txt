But you're in Florida. And how do you keep the jacket from falling off?
 omg I didn't realise she's in Florida. It's hot as hates and she's wearing a winter coat. I'm dead 

It doesn't matter! What matter is Melania has a beautiful heart and soul! That is all that matters. She is quiet, polite, nice and kind. God bless Melania
Lol 
Blessed to have Donald and Melania in the WHouse. USA!
I can hardly wait to see when The White House Christmas Tree is finished.
Make that staff trudge and toil to throw together the holidays for you while you eat bon bons while lounging around in the second floor private quarters.

Nothing against you but how about decorating Trump Tower and getting your husband to resign. That would be an awesome present to the country.

Happy thanksgiving to you First Lady

#LatinosWithTrump 
So excited about a nativity being there . Thank you
Now @realDonaldTrump will have some dolls to play with.
Does Melania not understand how coats work? And central heating?
I had enough of the coat on ur shoulders get over urself
Looks great. Thanks for bringing Christmas back to WH!
Is it freezing in the White House OR are you pretending still that you're a "model" doing a lifestyles fashion show. Who wears their coat on their shoulders and inside?? You're such a loser Melanie. Married for money gold digging loser.

It's simply amazing how much liberals hate a real man who loves sex. I don't know how lib men EVER produce children.  They have more estrogen than any woman I've ever known.
There is only one white house dummy

How’s your cyber bullying initiative coming?
Ditch your husband, he is a most hateful person!


Donald will spend next Christmas in prison
For what reason?

Ahhh, a true Catholic always gets “holiday” tree in before Thanksgiving!!! Nice job, glupača!!!
Ok have a nice preparation  but what's for?
I'll bet Donnie Dicklicker sat back and didn't do a fucking thing.
Holidays? Didn't elections your husband mean that you could finally say "Celebrating Christmas"? *Rolling eyes*
Really coooool, mam  1st Lady
HOLIDAYS??!! I thought the official WH position was that Christmas is the only end-of-year celebration we're allowed to acknowledge.
Are you saving our tax dollars by turner my the thermostat down? Why else where your coat indoors?
Definitely spell check. “Turning down the”
No "we" don't. WTF has she done that's so amazing? Besides married some old dude for money, and was born white? You repugs are revolting
Another jealous unattractive liberal Envy doesn't look good at anybody lady
Have you looked on the mirror sweetheart? You and your wife/sister aren’t winning any beauty contests 
Ohhhh did I touch a nerve? What accomplishments? Supporting a pedophile ? Boosting his broke ass with the presidency? Collusion? Corruption?
He’s sitting beside me laughing at the ignorance and naïveté of America repugs

When putting decorations on Christmas tree I often feel the need to casually drape a cashmere coat over my shoulders, said no one ever.
Thank goodness FLOTUS never took her kids overseas to be paid as advisors at taxpayer expense or hired their grandmother for 160,000/year nanny with full retirement.
Eric, Donald Jr and Ivanka are LITERALLY being paid as advisors - you must know that, right???
Yes and the actually ARE advisors unlike Malia Obama and her baby sister Who do you know that's as smart or successful as Trumps kids?
I can't stop laughing - I'm not sure what is funnier, these portraits you posted or your thinking straight up inheritance = success
Best FLOTUS ever!!
Hardly
Jealous much!!
Let them eat cake!
Enjoy another multimillion dollar tax payer paid golf resort vacation. 
I’m just really that the Obama’s never used tax payer money to take trips. 

#EducationFailed
Not EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND!
How many world wide site seeing tours has @FLOTUS and Baron taken?  Seem to recall Michele taking the girls on a few of those. Call it even.
Jetting to Trump's resorts, lining his pockets w/gov't money (paying himself for Secret Service lodging, golf carts, etc.). It's not even. Not even close.
Please tell me you didn’t vote for Hillary after that “lining his pockets” crap.  #Hypocrisy 

The man could cure cancer and AIDS, end world hunger, and bring peace to the Middle East...and you’d still talk about how horrible he is.  Policy/money has nothing to do with it.
Yep. Families take vacations together. The Trumps use tax money for all expense paid business trips, also.

Melania, please post the picture of the White House Nativity Scene. THANK YOU FOR bringing it back.
It never left? https://www.snopes.com/no-nativity-scenes-white-house/ …
White House Creche?

Thank you for restoring dignity to the WH.
I've had to retweet this and read like this post many times something or someone keeps going on my Twitter and unliking and I'm tweeting all of my retweets and likes I don't know who or what you doing it but I wish it would stop this is not right
Why are you out of the kitchen?
Love our President’s sense of humor 
It's a shame that his supporters are not very observant.
I’m a Trump supporter and what I’m observing is insanity, screaming ,crying, coloring books and play dough from the left.  I’ve never seen such a weak bunch of buffoons
And Trump supporters wearing diapers and tossing Kuerigs
Are you that hard up you have to use someone else’s identity? Afraid to use your own?
Since your hubby didn't have the decorum to tweet anything about remembering #JFK, will you?
Really? JFK died 50 years ago. Is he suppose to remember everyone who died?
Yes, really. if you're a real American, you should know this is a modern day president that was assassinated in Texas. He was beloved around the world. He has always been remembered on the day he was murdered. He wasn't "everyone" ...this was a president we were proud of.
I know JFK was a good man. I'm a history buff, but I even forgot today was the day he was assisinated and I dont even have half the shit to worry about that our President does.
Right. Like tweeting about how basketball players should be more thankful? Give me a break. Maybe if he had the sense to tweet about JFK, you and others would have remembered.
Well, that was just yesterday. And almost every channel has covered it. No one yesterday even mentioned that today was the anniversary of JFK's assisination.

Melania, if you need help, blink once.
It’s under SPACE way ... two words

NICE
How can you all be Hypocrites? You pardon Wishbone & Drumstick but allow the slaughter of Elephants for their Ivory!
The HOLIDAAAAAYSSSSSSSSS omg she didn't say Christmas!!! Blasphemy.
I thought we were saying Merry Christmas now! The liberals got to Melania! 
Wait, what?  Only leftists refuse to call it by it's name.  It's Christmas!

//Sarcasm//

Axial Tilt is the reason for the Season.
Give me a break, Melania did not decorate the trees.
LOVE
How cold is it in the White House? And do you change outfit every time you go into a different room? Oh, and you know it's still November? Okay...I see what you're doing 
Eeeeek!  Be careful.  Hubby wants everyone to say "Christmas" not "Holidays"!
What's pic 4, the brown triangle & blue fabric?

Where are the people?
Can you look anymore depressed?
“Holidays”?

WHY DO YOU HATE CHRIST?
Who decorates for Christmas with a coat draped over their shoulders?  Did she decorate the entire White House?  Lol. Maybe she was the one who baked Sarah's pie.
Oh for Gods sakes.  It’s Christmas!   Get over yourselves.  all that negativism  and it’s Christmas!  Move on
NO ONE LIKES YOU.
Its easy when your rich.

Blessed festive season to you and the President
The Christmas Card you sent from Whitehouse. Thank you.

Thank you @FLOTUS for returning Christmas w/o Mao Communist Christmas Ornaments. You bring so much grace and beauty to the #WhiteHouse and the whole world is in love with our first lady!

Thankful for a gracious First Lady with dignity & class!
Unlike her husband.
Glad to see class back in the White House. Thank u. #MAGA
Maybe that’s your definition of class.
Beautiful Melania, have a merry merry and beautiful time at the White House, You, Mr. President Trump and Baron, Thank you, myself and Liz my wife, enjoyed it. God bless you and keep you well.

Melania having her spotlight @WH. Trying to live up to previous First Ladies. I think not!
uh oh.....you said "holidays"  Didn't you get the memo that you're only allowed to say Merry Christmas?  You do talk to your husband, right?
Is it cold in the White House @FLOTUS? You always have a coat on. Turn on the heat!!!
Its our gracious First Lady in some pics enjoying thanksgiving.. dont make an issue of that too..
It will be a beautiful and Merry Christmas in the White House.
idiot prostitute.
Most pathetic @FLOTUS ever!

Wonderful. Inspirational. Well done.

You’re so brilliant Orson!
You live there, why a coat?
#Hotus
I have nothing against Melania, but she needs to control her crazy old ass husband.
"the holidays?" Didn't your husband campaign on saying Merry Christmas?
I thought @realDonaldTrump was bringing Merry Christmas back? He is going to be mad at you.
Thank you for bringing such incredible class to the White House
Happy Festivus!
How wonderful to once again say Merry Christmas!

Holidays? LOL!  I thought you people were only going to say Christmas?!  
Can’t they turn up the heat?! Why does she need a coat? Or is it from the Ivanka line of outerwear?
How can one look so unhappy when Christmas decorating???
She’s a product of Soviet parents. No smiling!
So we, the citizens of the United States have decorated the White House AND Mar Largo?
Do you even know how to smile?
I too wear a jacket without my arms in the sleeves to decorate my tree.
Do you need someone to check out the heating at the WH? You’re always wearing a coat inside and it looks super awkward.
Who taught you how to wear a coat?
Maybe the thermostat needs adjusting...
Such a graceful first lady.
Because THAT’S Important.
Enjoy, it’ll be the last one you spend at the White House.
Y'all enjoy! Hope it's your last!
You celebrate the holidays but shouldn't say happy holidays?
Please note if you don't engage with the new wave of neoNazi bots they'll skedaddle off to troll elsewhere-engaging them is counterproductive. Once Engaged triggers little Nazis to diatribe propaganda.
Very beautiful!
Tell me Mrs Trump what first attracted you to billionaire Donald Trump?
At the White House, so cheerful,calm and refreshing indeed, while, glancing back at the hectic time of the election tour days.
Beautiful
@realDonaldTrump she called CHRISTMAS holidays. Deport her! This is AMERIKKKA WE SAY MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS RIGHT @FoxNews ?
Start packing!
We The People Very Much Appreciate Our First Family @realDonaldTrump, @FLOTUS, and  Barron Trump Are Bringing Christmas Back To Our @WhiteHouse Wishing A Very Merry Christmas To Everyone!
That's all she's good 4 & doesn't even have to decorate
You make us PROUD! Stay beautiful in your heart, Dear First Lady.
Seeing these criminals in the people’s house makes me throw up in my mouth. Fucking traitors all.
You'rs going to be in trouble fir not calling it Christmas.
OMG...are those bare arms I see...how disrespectful of a first lady to bare her arms...where is the outrage from the right?
Stay positive, some people have nothing better to fuss about. Y'all have a wonderful Christmas season. Keep trying to be the best First Lady that you can.

Thank you for wording this in a way that is inclusive of all Americans, regardless of how they celebrate this time of year. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
Surely you meant to say “Christmas” because isn’t there a war on Christmas in which your husband @realDonaldTrump is the general?
Didn’t your husband say something about this is America and we’re going to start saying Christmas again? Guess you didn’t get the memo.
Plz help save alfie
Holidays? What’s with the war on Christmas?
I thought it was going to be "Christmas" during Dump's term.
WE WANT MICHELLE BACK
Sure there will be no Mao ornaments this year!
Attack on Christmas!! Melania said "holidays!!"
Thank you for becoming the biggest joke in the free world. One step from Russia, thanks Trump. Disgusted
It's Christmas!! Say holiday one more time
Dear Madam
I'm from Bangladesh. 
Merry Christmas to and all your family members.
Azizul Haq
Whoa outfit changes hahahaha
Why aren’t you ride-or-die Trump supporters up in arms because she didn’t say Christmas?
Who puts up Christmas decorations with a coat drapped around their shoulders?
What's with the hair? Afraid to show your face? I would be too, if I were married to THAT.
It must be cold in there.
Ni el abrigo se quito se ve que la obligaron a fotografiarse, ni una sonrisa.

Why do you wear a coat draped over your shoulders inside the house?
Why does @FLOTUS flotus always where her coat inside? Like, seriously, turn up the heat or buy a cardigan.
How does it feel to be sleeping with an obese, impotent LIAR? Seriously - you couldn't do better than that?
If that is a big chocolate house, it would be a dream come true to have something like that.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR VERY CAREING HEART AND EVERYTHING YOU DO TO REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES. WE LOVE AND APPRECIATE YOU.
Why is she wearing her coat in the WH? Is the heat off?

It’s as fake as you are
Merry Christmas to the Trump family. #MAGA
Say it in a language that the Trump family appreciates!!!!

счастливого Рождества #MAGA
Help me my bagarpepuls nohelpme
Holidays? Isn't it Christmas?!

How much does the temperature vary from room 2 room in the WH?  Enjoy the decorating.
Who decorated a tree with a jacket thrown over ones shoulders?????!!!
@SHSanders45 has been preparing too!
It's a store-bought pie LOL.
there was never a pie. it was all lies. 
Charming First Lady, you can order Christmas tree from my company
Ok.  Let’s all take a rest.  We all know that Presidents’and their families’ “vacations” have run up the cost to  taxpayers.  A mere pittance compared to the billions upon billions squandered by waste and fraud throughout govt.
Trump supporters have to be demons, because what else promotes this BS?
“Please watch as I touch things other people worked hard building. Because it’s not a Christmas in the trump household unless you are taking credit for the hard work of others.”
