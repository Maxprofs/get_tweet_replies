Class . God bless you Melania
She’s just a nice person I don’t get how we can have all these hateful people post ridiculous immorally wrong comments and Twitter does nothing. Bottom line our FLOTUS is the MOSTTIS 
Thank you @FLOTUS with love, from Texas 
Melina, you are an extremely intelligent, strong and beautiful person, inside and out.  You have grace, and spirit, which is why I cannot understand your devotion  to a man with no morals, ethics, or empathy for anyone.  Just doesn't make sense.
If THAT isn't a backwards compliment! 
Thank you for setting the example of Jesus pray for those that are against you you are a great example of beauty grace and wonderful Flotus
Amen First Lady @FLOTUS 
Melania you are a wonderful person, a great representative as FLOTUS for our nation and a true model of class, grace and warmth. Thank you. We love you!
Amen 
Thank you for saying that; I join your thoughts and prayers for President 41, and his family!
Total agreement with you in Jesus name.
Amen
Amen!  May God continue to bless  all the Bushes.
God Bless The Whole family. 
 Especially"
 President Bush..
God Bless You and Your Precious Family.
Gross.

Happy Birthday Melania, May all your dreams come true on this special day...
Happy Birthday to our beautiful, gracious First Lady!
You, madam, are one class act, and I’m proud to call you First Lady Of The United States!

With sincere love and appreciation from a grateful Vietnam Veteran...

I feel the same way. Here was a man and his wife who truly cared about the country and treated the people who worked for them as real friends and like family. I hope his last days will be filled with the knowledge of how much they were appreciated and loved by citizens.
You have my greatest appreciation and respect as First Lady.
May the God of Abraham,Isaac and Jacob deliver him and wish him a speedy recovery
Very sweet message on a very busy day of #FirstLadyMelania #StateDinner #GetWellPresidentBush41
Melania, you are just the sweetest kindest person!
You are very thoughtful and caring. Thank you for attending Barbara Bush service. I bet you enjoyed organizing the State Dinner it looked beatifull.
Pure CLASS!!!!
Get well soon President Bush.
Hmm he misses Mrs. And it's time to fly on sailor.... God's speed and semper fi
You are a tremendous woman God bless the First Lady God bless George
I can't imagine. It's so sad to lose your loves. He looks so lost when they show pictures of him. God bless him.
Happy Birthday Mrs.Trump. You are very brave. Don't let the press break you.He married you not the others trying to get your position. Smile
Happy Birthday Mrs Trump
Send some to @NancyPelosi she is having a hard time wrapping her head around things.
Amen !
#ClassyThoughtfulFLOTUS
As a society, we need to learn how to deal with death and dying. Here's a man who has just lost his wife, is 93 years old, and he has sepsis. Why is anyone praying for his recovery? Why not pray for a peaceful outcome, whatever that may be?
This after all the Bush's have bashed everything that You and @POTUS have done...that is what Christ told us to do..."Love Your Enemies"...it heaps hot coals upon their heads...keep up the good work @FLOTUS and have a blessed day...
Lol yep, that'll do the trick.
I'm no fan of Melania, but belittling someone for having a heavy accent sounds a little cruel, my family is full of people with accents so I'm sympathetic.
Trump belittles the Mexicans! HYPOCRISY!!!!!!!!!
He belittes everyone, even with the French President with his passive aggressive physical gestures, school text sublime bullying.
I am glad that You are our First Lady & I feel secure knowing you are backing your husband. We know you didn’t want to live in the swamp @the White House where ‘they lived’....but you 2 are doing a great job.Must be painful to see truth of Who these swamp people actually are! :(
Total class
Thinking of their family even though they photoshopped you out of that group photo.  Our First Lady has total class.
You & our POTUS are so loved Melanie. Thank you for loving our POTUS  & him loving you, our wonderful FLOTUS! We are so proud of you both!
Happy Birthday to You!
Happy birthday Mela
Happy birthday! We are so proud of you!!!
Awesome. I love you. From Nigeria with love.
Thank you for being the most thoughtful, loving, classy and, yes, beautiful First Lady this country has ever had. You have a grace that makes every previous one fail not just pale in comparison.
She is nice for this. My grandpa outlived my grandma, he was waiting for her. usually when you are married a long time, and one passes away the other is close to follow

You are such a classy woman. Thank you!
Beautiful Mrs. TRUMP.

All 3 of you please just take each others lives? 
STEP 1: Have a secret service person with you to make sure the last one is deceased to.

The Real, Vibrant, Inclusive & Progressive citizens of this great country would really appreciate it.
Melania you deserve so much more than you settled for as a husband. But even more important how do you explain this to Barron. Be the example he needs; stand up for your dignity.

Nice

Evidence? Did they Ever hear of “Innocence til proven guilty”? No so ignore them!
Nos pensées et nos prières sont avec  l'ancien président et  sa famille et ses amis. Dieu est avec nous tous.

I also pray for his health,, and apparently he is getting better. ! PTL

Thanks Mrs Trump!  Your well wishes for President Bush-41 show your respect and concern for a great family. It’s nice to see someone in your family show a little class.

Send thoughts to your husband to stand up and be a gracious president and has some manners. No matter what you do or say you will be associated with the adulterer, racist, liar!!!
Melania, Thanks!
Melania U r the most classiest first lady ever. Happy birthday to you,  and thank you for u & your son giving up your life to be our first family.  People r praying around the world 4 u  2 hang in & not give up.  God bless you.

Why don't you just leave him it would be the best thing you have ever done in your entire life
What makes @Flotus awesome is she clearly hates every fiber of her husband. As does most of America and the vast majority of the world.
I guess how much the world hates him depends of which news source you are using or whether you pay attention to the fact that he won the election. Personally, I'm going to go with the election winning thing. Idiot.
On Thursday, wishing a Happy, happy Birthday to our wonderful Flotus!! In Hawaiian, Hau’oli la Hanau! Many happy returns!! Thank you for the terrific job you are doing as First Lady for America! 
Happy birthday to the nicest, classiest first lady.... Love you...USA
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to the first lady
Thank you, Melania, for being so supportive and classy, in spite of such ugly attacks by the left. Keep the faith!

Yes, I agree that you are graced with beauty inside and out! Seeing you this week all in white was what I can only say was a real statement of Dignity! God bless you Melania Trump! The left could never appreciate a REAL woman!
Just wanted to wish "Our First Lady" a Happy Birthday.....Happy Birthday Melania....we are proud of you!!!!
Ryan that’s not going to happen so i would quit hoping if I were u!  God sets up “kings” and takes them down!
Amen!
GOD BLESS YOU PRES BUSH

Happy blessed birthday, Melania. We love you and pray daily for you and your family.  Remember, when all the evil happens around you, Jesus loves you and is protecting you.

Class act all the way. Love you.
Soooo how is the divorce proceedings going against me golden showers
Hello,

I was not a fan of yours but I’m warming up to you. Good job on the state dinner.
Just wondering
@Luciano09480407 Dio è grande.le preghiere dette con il cuore arrivano direttamente al nostro Signore onnipotente. Thank
I can see that you respect President Obama because you know the real Donald Trump
That Is Soo Kind Of You First Lady Melania. Iam Praying For Him And His Family For A Rapid Recovery. Very Pleased Attended Funeral
Me too wishing him well
You should just divorce Trump during the presidency.
A charming and gracious statement from a genuine lady.
You carry your role as FLOTUS with grace, kindness, and poise. I hate seeing the way you are treated because of the vitriol & hatred so many direct towards our President. Stay strong! You are a great FLOTUS!
When will you manage your own Twitter account?
Just a beautiful shout out to a beautiful lady for a beautiful state DINNER 
You did a wonderful job
God bless you beautiful first lady of the United States
I really think Melania is doing her best as First Lady besides the distraction created by POTUS...
Wonderful sentiments.
Q0
Thank you for taking Barbara Bush’s staff to the funeral with you! That was a very kind and gracious act! You are beautiful inside and out! You make us proud!!!!

Healing?
Glad you didn’t bring your idiotic donald. Nobody wants him and nobody cares for that MORON! #realDonaldTrump
RIP
Blessings for you as well.
Why does every post have to be made about politics? 
We love you President Bush we're hurting with you. Know one can know your lose completely, we're with you.
Sending thoughts of you being with a younger,  way more attractive man who is not a complete narcissist. Such as literally anyone else.
