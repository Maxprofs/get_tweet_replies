Dear @chrissyteigen congratulations on your recognition tonite at @CityHarvest Gala! Well deserved, your husband is lucky to have you on his side @johnlegend 
Get a fuckin life, dude. It’s a TV show.
@chrissyteigen it's a reality TV show. Not just "a TV show" . Calm the fuck down and wash your mouth out with soap. Don't be mad you got caught backpedaling. You said you were friends with @Kimzolciak on Andy's show. Why are you so amped up?? #RHOA #RHOAREUNION

John is a better Jesus than Me.

:(
Because you wear sandals.
You mean Michael lol
I miss Michelle Obama
Dear lord ...

@chrissyteigen Congrats on your award! Can you help my employee win our goofy hat contest? Her name is Shanae and she is the best. Like a too proud parent I need her to win!!!! https://www.facebook.com/PCLiquidations/posts/1610586415656879 …
You can go to galas?
Behind every strong man is a strong woman! You are so cool @chrissyteigen 
I love this whole interaction
Thank you for sharing this generous exchange with a Gentleman.  Refreshing and inspiring
Am I seriously the only one seeing “congratulations, your husband is a lucky man”?  If that doesn’t perfectly illustrate sexism, what does?
When foodies/chefs support each other #noheatinthiskitchen 
Yous a badass beotch, Chrissy. 
This tweet makes me so happy. So many of my favorite people in one place.
Congrats! Big fan of Chef Andres. Who or what was /is your biggest “omg they tweeted at me” moment?
