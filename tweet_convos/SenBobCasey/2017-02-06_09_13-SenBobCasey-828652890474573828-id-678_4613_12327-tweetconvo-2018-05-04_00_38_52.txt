whatever you have to do to keep her out of that office, thank you.
you do have a choice. Public or private school. But you pay for private.
Seems to me an educated public benefits you. Your % is tiny. #HoldTheFloor
I disagree. And vouchers and charter schools would only worsen education. #HoldTheFloor
This is not a matter of "winning" or "losing." It's a matter of being able to provide a well secured LIFE &
FOUNDATION to kids & seniors. There is so much at stake, WE need to stand TOGETHER and fight this. Otherwise
WE can have another repeat of HISTORY and that is NOT what WE want. WE should have a much more strong values
and understanding. WE know Congress will NEVER agree, that is why there are DEM's & REP's. WE the American
People LISTEN AND VOTE with whom should be our next leader. A follower will only follow a leader IF he/she
leads in the right direction. Otherwise, the followers WILL make their own direction until changes are made.
This has already been proven since the "so called" @realDonaldTrump has been in office. There are protests
thanks for trying. We're all screwed now. I'm a special education teacher and while I love my job I'm mortified
Too bad it didn't work. GOP just shut off phones and took government out of the hands of the people!
thanks for fighting!   Apparently payments work for votes.  Thanks for taking a stand anyway.
devos is gonna kill the nea
thank you!  Keep it up!  #WeThePeople are with you!
thank you for your NO vote. Thank you for not being for sale.
you guys are amazing and thank you for loving our country as we do!
Yeah, and how did that work out for y'all? :)  #DrainTheSwamp #TrumpPence16
Thanks for trying to stand up for our kids.
all you libtards are beyond redemption. Sick puppy's for sure!
Senetor Casey @PatToomey is a coward and a two face traitor! He never answer his phone! His working for himself!
thank you for bringing #truthtopower
thanks for representing us
the sad thing is that not one of you dems can pull a Republican to vote against her. Sad
If the only way is to get our point across and showing the Republicans that the "NO EXPERIENCE" Betsy DeVors is NOT
How does experience in a failed system help? @SenBobCasey @SenateDems
Simple, she is nominated for Secretary of Education. Taking that position means you should have at....
least some knowledge and/or Experience. She already admitted that she has NO EXPERIENCE & NO KNOWLEDGE
during her hearing when asked by @SenWarren. I posted that video, please watch that. Then ask yourself
this question, Do I seriously want someone in this position that has NEVER ONCE dealt with the kind of
money handling that she will be in charge of or take a chance on my child education? I'm sorry, but
I personally take education very personally. With the proper tools that are given and funding that is
Great effort.  Thanks! Let's get DeVos dismissed asap.  Get some sleep first to fight another day.
This filibuster was just a political stunt. If u really wanted to take a stand, carry it on indefinitely so no vote
yes yes yes
thank you senators
I get what ur doing,  ur not going to get mileage out of a protest. we the people need to stand up
#WeThePeople
Thank you for standing up for us and our schoolchildren. At least if we lose, we went down swinging. #HoldTheFloor
You lost!  Just like you will lose in 2018!
Mr DeVos gave $2 million $ to Republicans. Can't cut $ supply! Check HobbyLobby's $.
Can you explain how you've heard "vote no" on DeVos from PA voters but @SenToomey says he hasn't? #heslying #doyourjobToomey
Thank You.
thank you!! Even in the Trump alternative reality she is an uneducated pick. #DumpDeVos
just one more and then we can watch the show in the WH
Thank you for supporting our education system! #holdthefloor
Try to stay awake during this time. My vote is "Trash DeVos". That bitch shouldn't be on the ballot anyway.
thank you!
Thank You!!! Signed, The American People
I am #TheResistance #DumpDevos

Yep we know you are a union go up for election 2018. Need the money. Screw kids and their schools. Good luck bob

Thank you for your courage and hard work.
Sen Casey: I hope to God you get voted out of office. Remember Pa. went for Trump. Brain dead democrat!
Good. Get a better nominee, @realDonaldTrump. I'm happy with a competent conservative but not DeVos.
Thank you, Sen. Casey and all other Senators staying up all night to argue for what you believe in
Do not B bullied or cave 2 pressure 2 vote 4 Trump in show of unity  !!  It's only going 2 B 1 way
thank you! She is completely unqualified & will destroy DoE & education for #realPA kids. Wish @SenToomey heard us

pLEAse vote NOOO on DeVoss !!! You will have the public majorities respect!
Thank you @SenateDems!!!!
This 8th grade public school teacher thanks you for standing up for education. #holdthefloor
Thank you for protecting our education--the key to shaping the future America.
.@SenBobCasey @chrysta10 @SenateDems Hope there is at least one more GOP with Principles that does not always choose Party over country!
Fingers crossed  Our children deserve better than DeVos @SenBobCasey @SenateDems

Unless this actually does something, it's pure theater.
Thank you

@JoyAnnReid @SenateDems Betsy DeVos is not qualified to be in charge of our children's Education. Please oppose the nomination.

This is a litmus test Show us that a CabinetSeat can't be bought by an unqualified candidate! Do you have integrity
@JoyAnnReid @SenateDems please tell senator Toomey that she better be perfect, because his ONE vote will live on.
Thank you!
@JoyAnnReid @SenateDems please stop the madness.  Release her.  Let her go.
@JoyAnnReid @SenateDems Ben Carson as head of HUD is just is as dangerous but he got right through

HOFLOOR!! HOFLOOOOOOR!!!
I almost got us into a linguistic scandal by trying to do that
Ha!
Almost like the search for a spine is within reach.
Hang in there for our kids.
This seems more of #NotMyPresident and billionaire club. If you can't  afford education you don't get one. #NoDevos
I wonder if laze Bernie will be there?
@RagingHeretic @SenateDems grandstanding. It will be a 50-50 vote with Pence voting her in
because they care that someone who is fit should be appointed. Please do the same. We are appalled w/ #Devos
thank you!!
@ActualEPAFacts @SenateDems Thank you!  Where are you @SenToomey?

Because you guys don't have anything better to do with your time. So glad our tax dollars are being used wisely.
#holdthefloor #onemorerepublican
