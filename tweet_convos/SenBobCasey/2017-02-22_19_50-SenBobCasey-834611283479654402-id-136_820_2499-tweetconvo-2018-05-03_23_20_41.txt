I will continue to fight for the safety of all children. No child should be afraid when they go to school. #TitleIX
thank you senator, the trans children in this country need support now more than ever.
Less than 1% of the population is transgender.  Stop pandering.
Exactly! Majority has rights2.  The majority is supposed to be subjected to chaos to appease 1%
HA! the true MAJORITY has been subjected to TRUMP chaos. So much worse.
Ha!  You're funny.
U couldn't be more wrong.  What about the confusion the majority of kids r subjected to at the hands of a few?
It's called LIFE, they have to deal with it. How nice to be taught tolerance at an early age
The only ppl expected to be tolerant are Christians.
The cute little platitude love trumps hate is garbage. That has been proved by the hate shown.
try and keep up he's handing the power back to the states where it belongs
protect our trans kids.
Protect the overwhelming majority of kids who should not be subjected to chaos and confusion.
this is called sexual reprogramming in #Children and it's #ChildAbuse. A penis is a penis. #transgender
And means you were born male.  What is child abuse is subjecting the majority 2the confusion.
yes.   Jackie Evancho's sister is transgender.   She sings for his inauguration and then he  screws her over.
um like you all were going to screw her over BC she DID? My you are such a moralist. Want a trophy?
not at all.  She's in my area.  I love her!   He used her like he would use you or I.
the children you speak of need counseling - how about working on that...instead of wanting to violate privacy
why is this a priority for this admin? Not going to create jobs. Focus buddy focus. Not going to maga.
Priority because it appeals to his audience. He knows what he is doing on this one.
that rest of country don't buy into his crap.
Trump doesn't like barriers to bullying...sad!
you all don't like barriers to perversion. Plain and simple. You can't deal with life so u cry.
maybe if all u liberals didn't brainwash & drug our kids we wouldn't have transgender bullying. Evr thot that
Senator Casey, the new science denier.
thank you for standing up to @realDonaldTrump. PA is counting on you to keep standing up to the Trump administration.
Agree since Toomey has had amnesia since he got elected...he forgot who he works for!
get over it Senator. Somehow they survived before 8 months ago.
in K-12 schools, 35% experience physical assault & those bullied report a 51% suicide-attempt rate. Not OK before
1. Source that in criminal stats, not some 'study' 2. Compare that to all with some disability.
they should outlaw transgendering children until they're of age to make up their own minds
Are we surprised? He's the ultimate bully #transgenderrights
and you all are pacifists intent on getting us all killed thinking every1 is like you. Hav a will
wait, how is a transgender child using a certain bathroom gonna get you killed exactly?
Thank you for standing up for what is right and not what powerful conservative white males think of the world.
#impeachtrump
Contrary2the absurd liberal belief, the majority who live their lives as intended by birth/design have rights2
He is just adding to gender dysphoria. And he is a relentless bully himself.
the real world has bullies, stop adding to 'gender dysphoria' by shining a blinding light on it.
It's bullying to our daughters to allow boys to use the same BR and LR as them.Boys-boys room.Girls-girls room
DJT is bully in chief.
but Trump is well-known to be a bully, so for him it's par for the course
With all do respect Senator, these children need psychiatric help...
and they get it. Doesnt change who they are. How yould you feel if you were female in body?
Republicans are for WHITE,RICH,STRAIGHT, and Religious wannabes!
@Pat_Francis @realDonaldTrump Bob u have the power to do something to protect these kids that're vulnerable. What will you do?
sounds like we need better parents not the government trying to control
how can there be transgender children they're not old enough to vote let alone pick their own sex.... dumb
Using the wrong bathroom is wrong & troubling Bullying is never alright, stop bullying me with bathroom issues
Apparently @realDonaldTrump #PresidentBannon haven't met public school  moms. They have angered the women who get things done.
I thought the FLOTUS platform was against bullying?
But not surprising. Not proud to be an American.
@CrochetJanet @realDonaldTrump Thank you Sen Casey for speaking up to protect ALL children. #TheResistance
The DSM used to refer to menopause and PMS as 'Hysteria'. It's not a bulletproof manual
@Shakestweetz @realDonaldTrump and where is Melania? She said anti bullying is her platform.
very wrong! He must not be that wealthy because this is clearly a repayment for political favors
Thank you Sen Casey!
Hey it's time we the people go back to the courts let's see what they have Go say
Senator, your an inspiration to those of us who feel strongly that rights are for everyone! Thank you!
maybe someone needs to explain equal protection under the law to @realDonaldTrump.  Don, its the 14th Amendment #ImpeachTrump
What I hate all about of this, what about the feelings of everyone else?
Make "family bathrooms" that they can use. Worst thing: send transgender into boys bathroom.
The decision will be passed onto states, local districts, where it belongs. Good decision by @realDonaldTrump
T children need help.  Safety & privacy of others must not be secondary to â€œprotecting" Ts.
Bob why isn't the senate sharing bathrooms? Go take a shower with pelosi and see how uncomfortable it is
what percent of the population is this?
What does it matter? If it's one American constituent, it should be mentioned
i am genuinely confused with all of the problems we have as to why @realDonaldTrump had to target such a vulnerable group.
healthy children also face constant bullying from children from unhealthy homes. Let's focus on that first.
It's bullshit and you know it! Children need the correct teaching! God made man! God made Woman. No in between
so much of perception of trans community is fueled by ignorance & fear. Thank you for trying compassion instead.
it's even more troubling that parents let them mess with their gender.
Right thing to do. Why don't you trust this to the states?
thank  you for once again for protecting the rights of all Americans, especially those that are so vulnerable
@GOP stop calling ppl at #TownHall Paid Bullies-We r VOTERS & we r watching. GOP seats will b lost
we are all more alike than different and every student deserves the same rights/protection #CivilRights
Hey Bob, why don't you fight for the privacy of regular kids? Aren't they important too?
@GOP trump is vindictive and heartless and only cares about himself.
because trump goes after those who are the weakest and can't fight back. That's why we are here! #resist
you don't need to label trans children! They have enough to deal with. 13 mill other ppl in PA NEED HELP!!
I agree, kinda the same way people who voted for Trump faced from Democrats..Love to see one of them try me!!
Thank you Senator Casey! This is a disgrace coming from a potus.
Thank you Senator Casey
Trump is a bully and thinks bullying is OK.  Trump needs to resign.  He is a disgrace to our country.
wondering if kids care about this issue.
It shows an uneducated view and lack of understanding. @SenToomey @PatMeehanPA
he's a bully so he sees no issue with this.
Thank You Senator. Seems like compassion is a Democratic Thing
because showing compassion to millions of concerned parents and kids who oppose this doesnt count?
Yes, because they haven't been victims of hate crimes. The worst thing they'll face is occasionally feeling uncomfortable
he's a bully so he doesn't care about these kids
handy work of jeffy sessions
Trump is the biggest bully of all
@CBS21NEWS @realDonaldTrump you just earned a vote against you. ;)
all kids face bullying&law doesn't stop or enhance it
This isnt re:KidsOnly
rights/equality4all2 be considered
but kids are such an easy target for our bully in chief
this is so 1950s
If you were born with a penis use the mens room. If you were born with a vagina use the ladies room. SIMPLE!
My constitution doesn't seem to have that article... where did you read that this was required?
thank you
This is not a federal issue! And how many of the transgenders really care which bathroom? Feels manufactured.
Bullying is bad but seriously so do kids that are smarter, wear glasses or can't afford fancy clothes....
and this sort of order sends a message to hate groups that bullying or worse is acceptable. Saddened!
@MazJobrani @realDonaldTrump Trump is a Bully himself @MMFlint @askjillian
@MazJobrani @realDonaldTrump #Transgender people are also more likely to consider #Suicide, that's even more troubling. #Help
Thank you, Sen Casey, for your continued vigilance on these matters.
Thank you Senator !
I always find the nicest people to block in your thread.  Thank you.  Where's Toomey?  Will he stop the bully?
Who's the REAL bully?  Someone who tries to FORCE people to accept 'boys' with penises into girls bathrooms?
Sooo... a boy who identifies as a girl, but still has 'his' penis, should shower with my daughter?  Not!!!
Enough of the pedo regs. We're not going down that road. Grown men going in the ladies room - you're insane
Thank you @SenBobCasey!You are doing an awesome job!(Unlike MIA @SenToomey)As for @realDonaldTrump,let's make him less than 1 term president
very true Senator. It wasn't right.
Thank you!
Thank you for speaking up for the children.
He speaks for 0.2% of the children, screw the other 99.8%. My daughter is supposed to be ok if a boy comes in?
yes it is, as well as his ties to Russia that need to be investigated along w his taxes.
I would think that you would applaud this decision as it ceded power back to the states where it belongs.
it is also petty and partisan. Our country has greater challenges worthy of attention.
- lots of children are subject to bullying.  Deal with the bullying problem - this is not a bathroom issue.
Franky most what #45 does is both wrong and troubling!
make sure, make god damn sure these kids are protected. Not sure trumps youngest would make the cut
hey sounds like it's time for you to remind him of his own words
Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
transgender bathroom choice is not a right
We must have equality for all. Nothing else is acceptable.
Troubling is putting it mildly. High suicide rates, bullying, discrimination. This madness must stop.
stand up to Trump! We fo not want to go backwards
Transgender is the most difficult life situations for psychologists to help. Our government must support!
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump *almost always FTFY
Thank you, Senator for standing up to bullying and the biggest bully in the land.
Trump is a bully, so are you if you intend to fight against human rights. I will stand up to you! #EqualityforAll
No you have twisted views of what it is to be human. You apparently aren't one. Have a seat. #EqualityforAll
Do not call yourself a Christian when you do not believe in basic rights for all. You know nothing of Christ's love.
so much for little Trump being LGBTpositive....what a coward he is
thank you for standing up against the hatefulness @realDonaldTrump is spewing across our country.
"wrong and troubling". Harsh words
Everything troubles you people.
Our students have enough trouble these days. Why make it harder than it has to be?
thank you Senator Casey. @SenToomey are you ok with this?
Thank you for being our good senator
is there a "good" senator? Doubt it.
He took the coward's way out.
The only thing being undone is a threat to withhold education funding. Do you understand the 10th Amendment? @realDonaldTrump
Agree with the premise of your argument, but Trump has threatened to withhold money to multiples cities & a university.
Amen!
the bullying directive stayed in the order stop lying
