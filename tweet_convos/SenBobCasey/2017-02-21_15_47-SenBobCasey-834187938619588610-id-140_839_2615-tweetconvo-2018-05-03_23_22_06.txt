The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!
This lady is my new hero
Angry constituent gives Mitch McConnell the what for 
Ignorance and incivility are not virtues. @SenBobCasey
It's called the art of rhetoric.  Perhaps you should learn it, instead of confusing it with something else.
Yeah, I rarely take the advice of anti-Constitutional communists but, thanks for playing.  @SenBobCasey
So, no logic, no reason, no evidence, just a strawman argument. 

Awesome.
Not a straw man. Your profile page notes your objection to the Bill of Rights. @SenBobCasey
Huh.  Which part of not denying science and wanting equality for all is an objections to the bill of rights?
You may want to get your meds adjusted.
You are correct that we demand policies that keep us safe so why not get on board. MAGA
DJT must have these phrases on auto. fake, fake news, sad, so-called ... soooo repetitive...
@lafloran @realDonaldTrump trumpty dumpty would like to believe that.
@realDonaldTrump Planned out? Hell yes, and we citizens ARE activists, not lobbyists. Better get used to it. TY Senator Casey
@realDonaldTrump EXACTLY! The majority of Americans. If you want to be popular DT start being the Prez most of us want!
Yes, that's the main promise @realDonaldTrump needs to keep: To be so presidential we'll be bored.
Indeed. I'm so not bored yet. DT so wants to be as popular as #44. He should try acting like him
@kat_is_in I don't believe a word trump says anymore
Thank you, Senator Casey!!  We value you!
He seems to believe that liberals are, by definition, not citizens.
someone better tell him that we're still citizens even if we didn't vote for him...
Although Trump is trying to posture himself for the misguided to believe he represents the True News he will not succeed.
Thank you, again! Keep the pressure on, please! @SenBobCasey
Naive! They are paid protestors from Obama's Organizing for Action group.  Don't try to fool us.
happy to be one of the "so called," but can the so called president please be impeached now? Psych evals for future nominees...
@kathy19641 I second that! Senator Casey,TY, you have aides to talk to.Toomey is unreachable why are we paying him to avoid us?
@KaraCalavera Gotta love that "liberal" is this Presidency's version of McCarthy's "communist."
My favorite part is that he's insinuating it's a bad thing that people organize, as if protests are spontaneous or aren't real.
There's probably a 75% chance I'm going to end up having to seek asylum in Canada.
Thank you for recognizing that people are genuinely angry.  Not snowflakes, real people who The Donald doesn't understand.
You are amazing!!
.@SenBobCasey  trump just reflecting how he filled sits at rnc nominating convention and his inaugural.
Stronger Together! Thank you, Senator Casey!
bull shit. Breaking the law is NOT our values.
@realDonaldTrump exploited prejudice and ignorance to become a minority president...his values do not reflect the majority.
@MichaelROrtiz He's so full of hot air, somebody needs to deflate this piggy !!
thank you for speaking out for us again. I am one of your constituents, and your actions put @SenToomey to shame
keyword CITIZEN. if u don't go thru the process for citizenship u are not a citizen. PERIOD. Have u read the definition 4citizn
@realDonaldTrump If you live in a Republican district, you still get to be HEARD!  BE HEARD.  By the people, FOR the people.
Sure, Bob. No Soros money or central planning at all! /sarc
They are paid provocateurs! Civility has been lost, and you encourage it?
bob bob bob we're not buying into your lib lecture. That is why Hillary is not POTUS
I am a PA constituent and am angry with the republican agenda. Sen Toomey refuses to hold a town hall.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Senator. It would serve POTUS well to be reminded that we are also voters.
@realDonaldTrump Bobby are you really that miss informed???
I suppose someone "gave him this information" so it must be true. Keep fighting the good fight!
And so, what's his point?  The last time I checked, people with different viewpoints are allowed to express them and organize.
Ordinary citizens organizing to protest Trump
was there in ky. I wish he'd stop labeling people to satisfy his publicity needs.
We have a President who is successfully fostering division among Americans to convince his base - we are the enemy. Impeach!
@realDonaldTrump don't forget, @POTUS won PA, his policies are what we voted for, not yours
So happy someone understands!  Maybe someone should explain this to @SenToomey , as well.
how come democrats don't want to follow existing laws
@bryanbehar Thank you, Senator Casey, for responding in kind (via Twitter) to this statement. People need to know the truth.
@bryanbehar @realDonaldTrump Trump is just shocked that anyone could plan anything.
(Contrary to actually enhancing security too.)
thanks for trying to explain democracy to the potus. He still doesn't get it
thank you for doing your job!
Sen. Casey! Sane Pennsylvanians THANK YOU! #ToomeyDoesNotCare
tax paying citizens, motivated citizens, unpaid, focused on policy, holding everyone acountable citizens
Keep talking Sen. Casey. You are talking yourself right out of re-election. Attack the president? Lose votes!
@NetworkJunkyz Hey @realDonaldTrump, tell us why you believe the anger is not real. The anger is real & the root-cause is YOU.
investigate Donald Trump. Investigate Russia gate.
your Alt Left values are not mainstream American,you'll find out in 2018 that we're a red state now,term limits are coming
@realDonaldTrump I'm one of the non paid PA protestors and a citizen of the United States
@drumpsterfire damn right its planned & active. Guess what?Not going to end cause you send a tweet POTUS. Thank you senator BC!
Crafty Liberals! Brilliant enough to coordinate fake protests but not enough to win an election—even after stealing 5MM votes.
the majority of Americans know you are a destroyer and want you STOPPED..not everyone is like you and only motivated by $
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Please continue to fight for our America!  Fight to impeach this #UNQUALIFIEDPUPPET b4 it's 2 late
@realDonaldTrump Casey this Pennsylvanian cannot wait to vote you out
we would like to have a town hall with you in #Erie bob?
Nice set of rebuttals on the issues.  (Not "Alternative Facts!")
keep fight with us. Demand his taxes he has Russian ties. Do not let him destroy our Mother Earth.
@joshtpm  Butrightwing GOP Teapot activists you're okay with?! Please. We ALL have the same rights to protest, like you or not!
Thank you for telling Trump the truth
He really likes using 'so-called' doesn't he?
@realDonaldTrump No I really do live in @SenToomey 's district, unfortunately. And I'm very frustrated.
so-called crowds? so-called angry? These are crowds of citizens protesting harsh immigration policies & repeal of ACA!
@realDonaldTrump "Liberal activists" are voters too. As constituents, we are holding our representatives accountable to us.
@swim2. What's so hard to understand about citizens being pissed off about their LACK of representation?
someone please explain to me how people living in one area are only of 1 political party. It's not logical. Therefore more lies
@realDonaldTrump 

donald trump disgraces the presidency 

donald trump insults the nation 

donald trump is poison
so the only ppl living
 where these attacks are taking place are Republicans home areas. I don't believe that
TY @SenBobCasey America is better than @POTUS policies. PS Still waiting for POTUS to pay my invoice for protesting his policies

u will be voted out 2018 so the out of state protesters won't save you.
@jitterbug212 @realDonaldTrump No way !!!
@octoberskeye and @realDonaldTrump we ARE the majority & are NOT going away. We are watching. #ExpectUs #Indivisible
@joshtpm  So-called President.
you sir are a liar.
can he prove that...
Proud to say you're my hometown senator.  Keep standing up for our values.
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump

We're not paying you two nitwits to slap fight! Get back to work!!!
Thank you for speaking truth to power.
@joshtpm  We are just citizens trying to get our representatives in #Congress to actually represent us. @RepBost
You are a hypocrite & a fraud.
You believe in burdening Pennsylvanians with paying for $4.1 billion in welfare to support future illegal immigrants.
I think it is wonderful to see Americans stand up to this admin. Republican leaders won't do it!! Voters must!!!
You subjugate morality 4 votes. You're against the expulsion of Kate Steinle's killer, an illegal immigrant, career criminal.
Thank you so much for standing up to 45’s nonsense.
@EarlyFaye @realDonaldTrump another sound bite he heard on Fox while eating his TV dinner
@joshtpm suppress the media, courts and anyone who doesn't agree with your views Mr President?
Also, they want to keep their health insurance. @realDonaldTrump
thank you for representing Americans
Bullpoop.
@joshtpm Bravo Senator Casey!
R U READY TO TAKE  CHANCE ON SAFETY OF CITIZENS OF  COUNTRY BEC. OF SO CALLED VALUES. EXTREME VETTING & OUT W CRIMINAL ILLEGALS
thank you @SenatorBobCasey. trump should get off twitter and start working for all the people.
amen
I am a liberal planner, I guess, because aside from you yourself, every single other rep for my state and district is IGNORING
can you tell Toomey to stand with you on more issues,sorry to bother you but can't reach him at all.he is a coward hiding frm 
from us and give it to others that they set the parameters on for who gets it. 
but we need to have compassion they say!!!!  Well who has compassion on us who work our butts off only to have someone take it
You are a #Schumernista You will regulate US citizens and protest when non-citizens are regulated. YOU are endangering America!
talk some sense into your republican peers. Dolt45 is hazardous to our country.
Senator, FYI it took too many clicks to learn you're a Democrat! Maybe out "(D)" by your name?
Citizens demanded this ban when we voted @realDonaldTrump into office. These are sore losers, organized by bigger sore losers.
Rick Saccone 2018
not if their paid to be there
Thanks Sen. Casey! These are citizens, whom our so-called president claims he represents!
....bussed in idiots.....
Thank you, Senator.
no they aren't - the organized professional protesters; with support like this no wonder left is violent
trump calling like it is, they are organized to put on a show
it's really despicable that a president would disparage & de-legitimize US citizen groups regardless of how they are organized.
a lot of these groups are supporting terrorism, the left has gone insane
What on earth are you talking about? That is goofy. What groups are supporting terrorism?
nope they stand with demostic terrorism Casey getting the pink slip in 2018 because he supports these lunatics
What domestic terrorism? Name it. What kind of goofy myths are you buying into? Can I sell you the Brooklyn Bridge?
attacks on Trump supporters, shutting down highways, destroying public property, shutting down free speech
@realDonaldTrump dare you to go to a town hall and tell them they're fake constituents.
nope they are paid by Soros, left is insane
No. We are the majority and will protest until we are heard. We have moral high ground.
retraining miners to install solar better for all except profiteers don't know how to profit from sun
Sad is the complete lack of regard for the US Constitution by this administration.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, many have organized, but they're not paid protestors, they're constituents who live there, you buffoon.
soros troll
This is not my president. He should go back to the swamp
actually, he is your president, like it our not. I happen to like it.
so, even the conservatives I know, who didn't vote for him are Liberal because they put country before politics and party?
I wasn't an activist until Trump was elected POTUS. And yes, smart people plan. He's an idiot.
Thanks, Sen. Casey, for telling it like it is. Truth to power.
please fight to impeach this idiot!
@realDonaldTrump no Donnie,  your sad #impeachpresidentbannondumptrump #makehisamericawhiteagain
