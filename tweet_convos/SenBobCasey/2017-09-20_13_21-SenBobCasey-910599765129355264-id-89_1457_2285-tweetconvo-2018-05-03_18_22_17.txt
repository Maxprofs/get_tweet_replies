GRASSLEY: "I think we’re one or two votes short and I don’t see those other one or two votes coming." http://dmreg.co/2xjuzHm 
Senator Obamacare is a tragedy shut up
You don't know what your talking about. Plz get some facts. You'll be sorry if you don't!
I am 64 years old I have all the facts I need why don't you go away
Ps. Your supporting cutting Medicaid. Did you know it pays for most senior's skilled nursing care/home?  Fact
Okay Fact one Obamacare does not work will not work
Again, an opinion. What answers/solutions do you have?   I worked in medical field. I remember what it was like before.  ACA was good start
Like I said Obamacare don't work that's all I need to know
I'll check back in a year & see how that medicare is treating ya.Sure that you'll be whining when your coverage capped, cut. U don't get it
#AMEN!!!
Grassley probably said that to convince Americans that it's all over and they can stop calling. Yeah, no!
Never believe what a Republican says.
A sad but necessary lesson learned from this election cycle!
Yes, watch what they do not what they say.

Is it worse than the last "travesty of a health care plan"? #MAGA #RepealObamacare
Your MAGA plan is not healthcare.
Neither is Obama Care!
True, but it offers consumer protections from greedy insurance companies. It is a step forward. Reminder that it was Repub plan originally
I've contacted your colleague @SenToomey, but I know there's no way he'll ever put healthcare above tax breaks for the rich. Disappointing.
We will fight it @SenBobCasey @TuesdaysToomey
Yes please keep it up, maybe you can get me to have 4 plans, 1 for each member of my family. Bob you just don't get what you're doing to us
DO NOT BELIEVE IT. DO NOT LET UP.
Never believe anything they say!  They're adroit liars!  Please call!  I'd consider it a great favor!

Toomey always mysteriously vanishes from Twitter before he votes to screw over his constituents.
Good!This plan is worse than other two!
Wtf is wrong with the GOP? They are evil personified?
Bingo!

20% of our household income is currently eaten up by our premiums and will increase again starting 1/18.

Maybe it's time to take to the streets.....#Women's March2?  Time to get VERY LOUD!  Call senators again & again! 
cc @washingtonpost @nbc
TY for your vocal opposition. Now if only @SenToomey would be as concerned about the welfare of his constituents...18974
Regardless of substance?  No.  Why not a bill that helps Americans.  This is why I hate the GOP.

Just sent a fax to Sen Toomey to oppose this bill. Will do so every day until the vote....
Ditto. Plus phone calls.
Why do we have to constantly BEG for our lives? Fix the ACA. It would be cheaper.
It would be if mandates had not been gutted which reduces the number of younger & healthier Americans insurance.
 The Rs R made cost higher.
Vote our all who vote for the bill killing healthcare for millions & take away their tax payer provided healthcare.
Travesty of a healthcare plan is ACA, where your premiums would go down, you could keep your doctor, let's pass it to see whats in it
The hopalong Cassidy and Graham cracker "get it don quick" approach is lunacy. Like calling the people in lifeboats back to the Titanic.
Gee Bobby where is your bill, I must have missed it ?
#KillTheBill All Americans deserve affordable, inclusive, quality healthcare!
I called 10 Senators today and left voice messages.#Resist

Ha ha. Wasn't bragging. Just trying to motivate people to do SOMETHING! My Indivisible group is making calls.
I'll never back off the GOP!! I don't like what they've become.
I am a Republican who's party abandoned me and millions who actually believe in compassion and care about middle Americans and strivers
Here's the trump effect:  I see a Repub statement, and I don't believe a word of it. Period.
Mean like when Obama (Democrat) keep Dr. keep  H/C & save $2,500.   lies
Insurance companies did not want to comply.
Yes keep it up! It's a damn shame it's one or two short...should be majority opposed. GOP is the new death panel
#noGrahamCassidy #ProtectOurCare
Regarding the Repeal & Replace, Grassley also said that fulfilling a campaign promise is even more important that whats in this bill!  HEAD
#TrumpCare
US will defeat you and a complicit #GOP.
#KillTheBill stop this terrible healthcare plan!!  Thank you for your opposition to its heinous plan
Grassley must have a rat in his pocket
Travesty is ObamaCare!  New plan...start over or just plain repeal!
We won't quit until No American is left behind! Berniecare Now!
Dont believe it. It isnt over till it's over! #Resist 
"we defeat this travesty of a health care "plan.""

Americans must now look to political bosses for wisdom/mercy
We have surrendered freedom
Too bad me calling Patrick Toomey every day isn't working.
You're not alone!
Just pile it on em. Give them everything you got for as long as it takes because children's lives are at risk
Keep the pressure on @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins - Please consider people in your states & US #GrahamCassidySucks Vote NO
Please God. Please
How about those three democrats that Trump has been courting lately?
Donate to @SenBobCasey  relection campaign 2018. A real jerk is running against him http://www.bobcasey.com/ 
Thank you so very much, @SenBobCasey #PAProud
Yes. I agree. They say Sen. Rand has a bad habit of changing his mind. So we work esp on Collins, Murkowski, Rand and McCain.
Still looking for your suggestions... Anything?  Just one...   going to help fix this or not???
Democrats have been offering a bipartisan fix to Republican sabotage of healthcare for months. This isn't it.
So make your case.  Saying  the GOP plan sucks fixes nothing.  Make your point, get some support.  ACA sucks, this sucks.  FIX IT!!! Sell it
Actually, Graham-Cassidy is currently far worse than letting Republican sabotage of the ACA stand on its own. (1/2)
Your text actually sounded like you give a shit. We know better you are in trumps pocket , just like the rest of the GOP! #impeachtrump
Ummm... He's a Democrat...
I was referring to Grassley
Ok! 
I am just so pissed off at the GOP. I sometimes feel they are all just greedy mfs #the resistance 
I'm afraid it's become all the time for me. They want to be in power, but not to serve #LindseyGrahamsATraitor
#BillCassidysATraitor
Good news...so far.
So that means Murkowski, Collins, McCain, and Paul are all firm NO as of right now, but of course that could change WHEN they're bribed.
Let's hope so / not

Called @SenToomey in DC today and they said he's not releasing a statement. Then hung up on me. Wouldn't answer ? About taxes
Tell the resistance we have engaged the republicans
Indivisible 6 caught up with Rep. Black about the Graham Cassidy bill. @Rep.DianeBlack #Indivisible #GrahamCassidy #LetThemEatCake
Keep calling 202-224-3121. Every GOP Senator needs to hear from us! Call every day & let them know Save #ACA Vote NO on #Trumpcare
You working on Toomey?? Any hope?
Should I call you too, Bob? I have not yet because I am fairly certain of your vote :) but if you need numbers I'll be happy to.
#noGrahamCassidy #keepACA
Thanks, Senator Casey, for your voice. We appreciate you fighting for our health care. 
Sen Casey is Fighting to take away HC from millions of Americans.
Lucky you, no one you love or care about has a pre-existing condition.
Why did you vote yes on giving the president more power to wage war w/o consulting congress?
Thank you @SenBobCasey.  Your fight will save families.  It is very calming to know that I have one senator who actually cares.
The GOP are killing Americans if they vote for this bill. It should be a bipartisan effort to fix the ACA.
It was almost headed that way, FINALLY, until Koch threatened to pull Republican $. DISGUSTING
Toomey is unturnable. Can Pennsylvanians affect Portman or others?
Hey bob are u going to cut my premiums this year I think not
Senator Boob Casey...you voted for the real travesty, Obamacare. Nothing but a DNC lapdog.

Go Mr. Casey! Keep up the good fight!
I can't wait to vote for you.  I was on the other side until Trump.  Thank you for being the real deal.
Help us please
GOP are known to lie I hope it is true but it would be even better with more GOP not voting for it.
This plan is an act of terrorism on US soil.
Do you need Toomey's phone number? You should call him too.
