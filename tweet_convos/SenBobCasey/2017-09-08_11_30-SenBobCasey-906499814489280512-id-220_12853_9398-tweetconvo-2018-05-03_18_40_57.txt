What about Orlando, Fl?
Hi. You can text SHELTER and your zip code to 43362 (4FEMA) - std msg/data rates apply. Web: http://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter …
Thank you.
FEMA has an app? TIL
We do! https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app 
Since when?
Will Lakeland be effected or evacuated?
Hi Margie, please listen to your local emergency management agency for instructions on if, when, and how to evacuate.
Thank you. It is my father-in-law who lives in Lakeland. He refused to evacuate because he has no records for his dog. Praying...
Its evil not to except pets@shelters. That's whats worrying me the most about having to ride out the storm. Not going to leave my little boy
I wouldn't leave my baby, either. I'd go down w/ the ship rather than leave my cat behind. BTW, cute kitty you have, there.
Yep, it sad that they make people choose between their fur babies or their own safety in emergencies like this! & thanks, he's a sweetheart
I have no children & my pets ARE my children.I once put myself between an unleashed Akita & my cat. I was willing 2 take the bullet for him
My cat is my child too&we've been through a lot together. Keep your fingers crossed for us in Tampa! &good you keeping your baby safe!
Wishing you the best w/ the hurricane. I've been to the Tampa area. really nice. Keep the kitties safe!
Thank you! We're all ready to ride it out and have backup plans in place. Pet friendly shelters are within a 20 minute drive thankfully.
Best of luck to you & your babies.
And if you only have a computer and not a mobile phone?
You can check local emergency management websites & social media accounts, or the Red Cross website: http://ow.ly/AFqX30f1fTM 
Thought those were tornadoes!
Thank You 
Didn't see where @oliviawilde is opening her homeup to refugees of the storm

FEMA, please talk to Polk County Sheriff about endangering lives by threatening to arrest people for minor violations and immigration.
Why don't we see contra flow traffic on evacuation?? Open up those southbound lanes for traffic north. Leave one lane for south!
I've been asking that of many people here in FLA. No answer. They did it in NY w/Sandy.
See those people at Gandy Bridge going down to the shoreline to look at the water receding?
Lucky to get my twins going to school down there out of south Florida just in time, so sad, prayers for all
Thanks but Trumps got this.
Mar a Lago? Unpresidented
#GISINACTION

I'm gonna hangout with the news crews
That hurricane is nothing haha. Maybe in Miami but, that's where most of the shelters are anyway.
I have been there and it is very upsetting to see this! #Pray for those in the path of the #Hurricane Irma!!
@splurt
@haley6michelle
Wheres the fema camps when u a tually want one? Even sauxi arabio has 100000s of A/c tents. Post katrina nothing ldRned
Additional safe havens available for leggy blondes.
@noaramz  


Since this all a @fema orchestrated hoax, please ensure @rushlimbaugh is escorted back to his residence and confined there.
#FortMyers Shelter is Not Full as reported.. Per @DrewGriffinCNN on site. #StaySafe everyone and Thank You for your support in #Irma2017 !
Wow that’s an amazing thing
@ndmaindia Lessons to be learnt. #Cyclones
Because FEMA camps are SUCH a good idea to "go visit."
You are a great country
@TI3RRV_
@buzzzbabe idk how helpful this is at this point but...

More Fake News from HUMPTY TRUMPTY BAD very bad
Looks like your shelters need to evacuate to the North.
Stay safe 
Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/fema/status/906223106775232512 … (Ranked 10th for Sep 8.)

@ScottieBaugh 
IF YOU NEED A RIDE TO A SHELTER, CALL 1.800.955.5504.
@Jessitoburrito
@missmiameo !!!
If people evacuate without their pets can you sent them back in to save them?  Take your pets or don't evacuate.  Should be a law
don't trust anything you see or hear on TV or on radio or on the internet
@DaSaucyJ_49
 #irma
FEMA= concentrated camps
saying that, if these persons have the Internet.
I pity and pray all evacuees in FEMA shelter west of St Pete. Deadly wind plus storm surge there... What the heck?
So this is the new world order...
Check out @Space_Station’s Tweet:
The space station flew over Hurricane Jose at 10:10 a.m. EDT today and over Hurricane Irma at 11:40 a.m. EDT today. 
Best of luck Tim @timfargo @alphabetsuccess
Stay safe
Tell ppl to take their pets too, not board them in a clinic forcing those employees to risk their lives to stay to protect other ppl's pets
Geo engineering
Climate change
Have you checked lately - many of the shelters are completely filled
You should be calling on Liberals to open their homes and share their wealth...since they're so compassionate and all 
Sex offenders are being denied into shelters. Id is required. They will die. Sex offenders today, what groups tomorrow?
Stop fear mongering bro with this "they going to die" shit smh
Honestly tho, those are the ones that can go . 
I feel u but im tired of every1 talking like irma gonna kill every1 in Florida lol fucking ridiculous how fear mongering works these days
Lmaoooo okay true
Trust,I have a 10yr old girl and I would murder any1 with my bare hands if they harmed her so I know where u coming from.
If you put your life in the hands of fema you are a fool
Great fema...... Now just give us the gas to get there 
Re: gas being takin misstate to get those trapped there won't gas out.
Many prayers to Florida may everyone stay safe
Official guide about humans 2.0
Death Camps.
This is what FEMA is for! Good job
@charlieINTEL florida about to get ass fucked
Your attic or basement are the safest places to be right now!
@KTVU where is maro-lago?
And please for the Love Of God don't stay and then when the Hurricane hits and then leaves say "I did not think it was going to be that bad"
you have been warned for DAYS
There should be some in Orlando.
Please head south
F the app! Just put the damn list up.
But No Climate Change
List includes... Anywhere but Florida...
Prayer for my godmother's aunt
Flats we best us navy
Flats we best
@nisha_miller192
Yeah is Hitting Tampa now.
Orlando has none. You would think that a town full of theme parks could manage to do some hurricane preparation.
Warm seas causes deadly winds
Dosrnt work
Pay the victim's of Harvey! Cent get back into site. 15 days isolated!
Just down loaded it , thank you
And most of them are on the coast. Smart move.
As it stands do people need to be concerned if in Albany, GA?
You guys will deal with a lot of rain. You'll be fine
#HurricaineIrma #Florida
If you’re directed to evacuate due to #Irma and need a safe place to go, you can find a list of shelters in our app: https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app  
My elderly parents won't go to a shelter. Too hard to pack and go. @fema you need a place specifically 4 elderly w dementia & health issues
Jesus Christ.. You didn't go help them????
Hope everyone that needs this finds this.
@shari_pronobis thank you @POTUS
President Trump's Budget Would Cut Hundreds of Millions From Disaster Relief Programs http://time.com/money/4918458/trump-budget-targest-disaster-response/ …
And he didn't invent FEMA
just signed a $15 billion disaster relief package with the help of @chuckschumer & @NancyPelosi .
Yeah and the Republicans are so mad!
@rspi__ for your dad
Okay thanks bro, thankfully he got a full tank of gas and is about to head out now but I'll send that to him
No problem and alright good
Looking for one in Savannah GA, lmk asap before this shit hits
Alright thanks I guess I'm dying here 
Lmao
Folks that aren't evacuating need to look at #Barbuda #Maarten
LOL SIKE

I was honored to speak with you @refee00!! Thank you and you are truly a courageous #Whistleblower. I hope our interview goes viral!! https://twitter.com/refee00/status/899469441230139392 …

When I see the traffic leaving I'm curious as to why there are no school buses or @uhaul trucks on the roads! That would save lives & trucks
So many do not means to evacuate.
@Punch2u
is the list updated when shelters are full?
Look for the old schools built in the 30's in Camille it saved us.
Are the goddam sheriff deputies going to arrest people with traffic warrants?
Evac with pets?  Lots of folk.
#ClimateChangeIsReal #Trump #openyoureyes #HuricaneIrma #huricaneharvey a fact #parisclimateagreement a must!
@LemonLimeBacon
Thanks. Very useful.
BEEN HIT ALL YEAR BY CELEBS REFER TO TIMELINE INCLUDED ALL GOING ON SINCE 2010 ALL RELATED TO FAKING REAL HURRICANES #HELP #ATTACKED
@Hot1015Rico @2reezy
Be safe. Think. We felt our truck lift up and we jumped in a deep ditch. The hurricane dropped the lifting truck thanks to our trailer.
Dear .@fema:

Stay safe; stay funded.

Sincerely,
The American Taxpayer
REVERSE LANES! What's wrong with u people?
Reverse lanes? That's not how that works 
Someone don’t even know about the hurricane and is like “crap did I leave the stove on”
I don't understand why they can't open all 4 lanes north?
Because some people might forget something very important and need to go back. (Family or pets, mostly family that can't get out)
Searching the shelters is hard, goes by the nearest large city(i.e. Plantation has to be searched under Fort Lauderdale)
If you are a Republican who doesn't believe in climate change, just stay home and ride it out. There's nothing to worry about.
Please be careful about everybody resident in Florida, a hurricane Irma. 
I'm praying from Japan 
You & your prayers are appreciated
Just saw on the DC news that some folks are being turned away from shelters bc they didn't "register in time?" Is that true?
See latest 12z #ECMWF Ensemble spaghetti, example #Miami #FLwx gusts - check any place/parameter via menu

God Bless this good team keep it up!
if U have pets The Gov of Fl proclaimed all hotels/motels accept pets Pets must be allowed in shelters also this is great
I think u goofed up. Irma going up the west side of FL
Great solution ready for deployment

New ISIS plan to attack the West = Poisoning random grocery store food with Cyanide. Lecture me more about why we need more refugees...
@indepndntchick
How do you join fema or help volunteer red cross ect
I would look at their websites for info. for TX, they had a list of shelters needing help. I know Red Cross has an application process
Thanks
Ms. Clinton, do you have info for people w/ pets?!!! Don't leave pets behind.
@ScoutSteveR for your sister in law
Hope you can send the illegals back who go to the shelters
Pls send USA troops inmediately after the hurracaine. Criminals always take advantage under this situation.
Hi your Columbus, GA location is out of date. The shelter has been moved from the FDC Rec Center to the Columbus Civic Center at 400 4th St.
Thanks for sharing! Info for those in search of shelter during #HurricaneIrma : http://fema.gov/mobile-app 
Stay safe guys!
And there's apparently nothing in Orlando or on the east coast...
Orange county now has shelters.  Also a host shelter for coastal evacs. FEMA app doesn't show.
@TaylorJayLive
I heard that people we still lounging on Miami Beach. Seriously, get off the beach and get out.
Let those fools die.
And if you have unpaid parking tickets, do not seek shelter in Polk County. Sheriff Judd is more concerned with his numbers than human life
Unless you have unpaid parking tickets. In that case, go directly to jail.
Jesus Christ come
@FLGovScott will fema attempt to disarm us the way they did during Katrina?
were you in a FEMA shelter at the time of Katrina? How did they treat the people? Reports r coming that r not favorable at all!
I wasnt that's why I'm asking
