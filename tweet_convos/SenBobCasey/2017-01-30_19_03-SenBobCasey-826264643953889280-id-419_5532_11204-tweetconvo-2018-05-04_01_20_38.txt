u are so full of it. I consider u amonst many that ar traiters to our country. U will be replace one day soon. Thank god
WRONG, Senator. She blatantly disregarded a perfectly legal Executive Order. She is insubordinate.
she did what Jeff Sessions told her to do under Obama but now it's insubordinate?
That is plain wrong. Where do you get such drivel?
@SenBobCasey here:  https://www.yahoo.com/news/video-shows-jeff-sessions-pressing-sally-yates-to-defend-the-constitution-against-presidents-unlawful-views-151137405.html …
and here: http://www.newser.com/story/237663/sessions-once-told-yates-to-refuse-improper-requests.html …
and about 30 other places yesterday.
Nice try, genius. She broke law by refusing to enforce a lawful #EO. She was rightfully fired.
AG's job is to remain loyal to law, not the President. NIxon didn't get that distinction, either. She is a hero.
A Dictator's response ppl
Prez. Trump betrayed & is still betraying the American people. All of us around the world watch in horror this DT reality show.
If you are not doing the job you are paid to do,  you should be fired. #toobadyoucantbefiredtoday
I Wish all Elected Officials, and their aides, could do the same...http://www.kcra.com/article/former-aide-to-mayor-charged-in-credit-card-scandal/6414739 …

@POTUS  All the more reason to oppose Jeff Sessions who wouldn't defend the law and constitution - would only do DJT's bidding
THANK YOU! you are a giant among men these days.
Sir, you better have a backup plan b/c these jerks aren't playin. They have hijacked r govt. 
Show us where she upheld Constitution? Recite Article?  Prove your traitorous case.  American citizens elected our @potus !
Deplorable Citizens  mean bigoted elected @POTUS
Tonight's creation.
@POTUS and if a soldier defied an order it would be imprisonment. In the real world insubordination deserves termination
you will not be voted back in, by democrats or republicans....
NO she did not do the JOB we pay her to do, playing politics is not working, upholding the LAW is her job
thank you for doing the right thing
She was fired for saying screw you to the President. @POTUS was completely within his rights to fire her.
yes she is a hero. Don't let her work be in vain.
I agree with you!
When can you impeach Senator? #MondayNightMassacre
For what? Lol
She didn't even make an effort but went with her political opinion instead of law which her dpt. had already passed & executed.
@njm4250 Funny how an equally trained and qualified person thinks opposite?
our president thinks he's in a Bruce Willis movie.
She betrayed her oath and was derelict in her duties.  Therefor she was releaved of her post. Not a damn thing anyone can do.
@POTUS Thanks Senator Casey for defending Sally Yates and stepping up against the worst of the #SwampCabinet . You're a hero.
@DNC @keithellison If you confirm @SenatorSessions American people will know UR w. trump not us #JusticeDemocrats @TYTPolitics
2. But don't just vote no. Withhold consent on Trump's nominees until the ban is lifted.
IF a democrat gets back in office they will return the favor
Maybe, maybe not. This is an alarming attack on a basic tenet of our democracy. Stops must be pulled.
he is not breaking any law he is not targeting Muslims and the Democrats don't have enough seats to keep sessions outlol
Vote NO to everything. These actions are flagrant violations of the law and are unconscionable acts against this nation.
Actually Nina, they don't violate any laws. Sally made no legal argument.
The constitution is the legal argument.
No Nina, read the constitution.
I have
What part of the constitution are you arguing? Specifics please.
Lol another liberal fake trying to justify AG repulsive actions
you're right, Senator.
If we don't defend our Constitution who will. Trump does not respect or defend Our http://Constitution.How  much proof U need?
@Varidienne amen.
@FrizzleFelicity yeah, isn't the president supposed to uphold the constitution too? I seem to remember him vowing to do that.
I think he lacks the capacity for memory, facts or intelligence of any kind.
I resent this Administration's #alternativefacts and bullying of Government employees, journalists and citizens.  #impeachment
Thank you for standing up for Sally Yates, an American hero who spoke truth to power!
Who actually wrote that?  Sounds more like Bannon?  Betrayed who?  She honored the COUNTRY and the LAW.  FY TRUMPY.
ReTweet to shout our support for Sally Yates and all patriots #ProtectheFreeWorld  
#RespectSallyYates
She is a Dem political hack, not someone standing for justice.
Remeber Bob, you represent more then just Pitt & Philly. PA went with Trump & we will go against u if u continue to play games!
.@SenBobCasey @Vickie627 Great! What will you all do? How are those articles of impeachment coming along?!
Isn't this "betray" thing akin to what woman from Oral Roberts Univ said re allegiance to GW Bush/a Alberto Gonzalez trial?
@WendyMarcinkie1  Trump never read the Constitution
He uses it for toilet paper... That's about it.
he certainly doesn't respect it.and at this point I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to rewrite it
That's what people fear the most.
Not true.  Demonstrates your stubborn willingness to obstruct the law and Constitution.
@DebbiePeter3 @POTUS thank you Senator Casey!  Make PA proud!!!
@POTUS the President disgraces the office, our constitution& our founding fathers.
@POTUS  we love you Senator Casey.  Keep up the fight.

One man will not destroy a Nation
Spill into the Streets Sat. Feb 4
We the people demand he be removed
#TakeAmericaBackMarch  #TheResistance 
I will like he says
Bobby more PC baloney ,who writes this stuff for you.
views like yours is exactly what we don't need in Washington. You wanna twist what the constitution means.
@POTUS Thank you!! #The Resistance
@POTUS her twitter handle is gone. SAD
@POTUS She did betray Justice Dept, Constitution, most importantly, the CITIZENS OF USA!
Sally has more balls than TrumpBannon and rethug congress put together. You go girl!!!
@POTUS sally Yates defied the Constitution. She needs prosecuted
Didn't know Casey was still alive. Never seen in PA
Bull.Shit. She was fired for failing her client.
@POTUS And why the fuck is he using Facebook for such statements?
Good for you!  A voice of reason. Thank you. Vote NO on AG nominee to make our voice LOUD & CLEAR to Trump/Bannon
@POTUS illegals don't have constitutional rights. The president did the right thing.
@Nica24 @POTUS Absolutely!
Just like Pennsylvania did when they voted Trump. lol

@POTUS Projection.... TRUMP IS THE TRAITOR
All of PA is watching how you vote, Senator!  Please fight Trump's cabinet!
please vote NO on Sessions
@POTUS so you believe anyone can be President of the U.S. At any moment if you agree with their politics?
@POTUS Senator Casey, the day you are voted out of office will be a wonderful day Pennsylvania.  Living in the status quo!
@POTUS thank you Senator Casey.
Now your turn to defend it, Senator, on behalf of all of us in PA. Vote no on Sessions and Tillerson.
Kelly what did he say he do for you
Twitter is full of misinformed trolls but you know the constitution and your ethical obligation to hold up the law.
please keep up the fight Senator Casey!   And no to Sessions.   No to DeVos.   No to Autocratic rule.
@POTUS Sally Yates is a partisan hack. Just like of Dog Whistle Casey. The DNC must have got your talking points to you early.
Bannon has created a "shock" event. Very important lesson from Heather Richardson, professor of history @ Boston College. Read!
https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/826282086717722624 …
Democrats might back off on Trump's SC nominee. Are you kidding me? What the fuck is wrong with you?
The Democrats remain hopeless. Can someone who understands politics please take over the party. https://twitter.com/CNN/status/826251409616171008 …
Thank you Senator Casey!
I can't wait to vote against you in 2018.
US code title 8 gives @realDonaldTrump the authority to deny any non-citizen entry. Yates refused to uphold the law.
@POTUS Since when are people from other countries covered by our Constitution?
Will you stand for the students on our campuses who are denied Due Process, procedural safeguards, support & care? @POTUS
This is a book you need to read:

@POTUS her job is law not politics. Yates is national hero in my book. Let's find more like her.Courage and loyalty for USA 
Thank you. Please withhold consent to all of #presidentbannon confirmations until Muslim ban is revoked. #nojusticenobills
Thank you! Keep fighting for what's right. And please...put an end to this madness. #StopPresidentBannon
@POTUS May not have happened if you would put through Jeff Sessions! PA voter.
@PADems Thank you, Senator. Can we impeach and remove the current President from office yet?
thanks! We should encourage the Senate to ask Session his own question when he grilled Yates: https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4653685/ask-sessions-question …
she should b held in contempt and locked up.
@POTUS Impeach this Clown Show!! #ShowUsYourTaxes #RussianInvolvement #PresidentBannon #MuslimBan #mediablackout #NixonRepeat
@POTUS Bob, and whoever writes your tweets for you, you are really starting to embarrass PA. Please go back to your GH hole...
it's not unconstitutional you twit. Even Alan  Dershowitz called her out for making a BIG mistake, & for being political
He called it "Holdover Heroism". It was a big mistake & was unprecedented but does not surprise me that...
...Dictator Bob of the Dictator democrats would support and invite this disregard for the constitution & settled law..
... And then try to foist that on ignorant followers fanning fear that their President is some sort of evil Nazi! Shame!
The lier is you Bob!The flouter of the Constitution is you!!The danger to the republic is you!!!Why do you hate America?
... And why Bob do you hate American workers so much?You are a stain to the Casey name!Your father was a great American!
sir you are totally incorrect in this statement.
Will you say the same about the mayors of our sanctuary cities when their funding dries up? #Trump #yourefired
@POTUS Please vote no on Jeff Sessions confirmation. We need someone who will uphold our civil rights.
@realDonaldTrump I wish Trump understood difference between President and Dictator #StandUpToTrump
totally disagree Sir. We both know that Holder nor Lynch would have done the same to #44. We lost a SEAL in Yemen yesterday.
impeach now?
Yates did not defend Constitution she trampled it just like Obama
@POTUS Yates a hero
Yes, she did. She's a true patriot and a real American hero. Remind your colleagues on The Hill what having a spine looks like.
@POTUS PLEASE VOTE AGAINST THE RACIST JEFF SESSIONS!
@POTUS I'm so glad you're my senator. Please keep siding with We the People, and not this administration bent on destroying us.
For the love of God, why the heck do YOU Liberal politicians spin the actuall FACTS to the American people, pushing Falsehoods
Please stop Trump.  He is unfit, out of control, dangerous.  He and his appointees do not represent America.
@RepTimRyan @POTUS  this ban will make the leaders of those countries affected to fight terrorism in their countries period!
@RepTimRyan America needs a strong man like Trump not a weakling like Obama
@RepTimRyan you guys are hypocrites
support & defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign & domestic;
How soon can we get her on SCOTUS?

#YatesForSCOTUS
Sorry, Senator, but the Constitution does not guarantee ANY Foreign National "the RIGHT" to enter The United States.
You need to obstruct everything. No cooperation. NONE. DJT is a catastrophe - impeachment or 25th Amendment.
She didn't do her job, which was following Trump's executive order, guarantee she followed Obama's on the Iraqi ban.
An awful habit of a weak personality is to accuse another as traitor.
Thank you! Please continue to oppose this outlandish agenda. #itsacoup
Thank you, Senator Casey!
Better read 8 U.S. Code 1182. Uneducted liberal hack.
Nah Sen she acted like a political appointee. And down in flames
Funny how democrats talk constitution now.  After they watched and approved as obama trampled it for 8 years.
@morgfair @POTUS #theresistance @KellyannePolls
@morgfair @POTUS FYI
Amazing. Sally Yates at her confirmation hearing answering her job-ending Q. Look who's asking. Via @charles_gaba  
FAKE NEWS....
wishing more old senators would step down and let some new blood in Washington that can get things done like Donald
answered survey on FB replies got rejected for no donation what a political  joke you are
so much for separation of powers.
Well said. Now go out and convince some GOP senators that we are in trouble. That's your job; it's called governing.
@POTUS She got what she deserved for being insubordinate.  Every partisan statement you make gets you closer to losing in 2018.
@POTUS  Senator, Please cite which articles of our Constitution are being violated by this temporary ban.
#ImpeachTrumpNow
@adigoesswimming impeach him now!
@mpac_national untrue sir.
@realDonaldTrump has created an unnecessary crisis in America tonight! Amendment 25 section 4. Start now. #UnfitToLead
These last couple of weeks, I have been proud to call you my senator. Thank you.
"betray" is a chilling word. Does he think her oath was to him, rather than the constitution?
what part of the constitution exactly?
@POTUS that's right
Thinking Little Sisters of the Poor would disagree.
I'm speechless
obstruction 8 years say no to all! We the People are not laying down, you better fight every nominee including SCOTUS'
@POTUS Thank you, @SenBobCasey!
@POTUS Thank you, Senator Casey! #TheConstitutionRules
Is Sally Yates, Serving Republic USA HERITAGE UNDER GOD, OUR JESUS CHRIST AND LORD?   SALLY RISK USA HERITAGE & Jews Safe?
Keep defending America
yet we're not doing anything about @POTUS disgracing the Constitution every day? How long do you let this go on? DO SOMETHING!!
Which DNC doesn't do. She has more courage then all of U who stand on sidelines. FIGHT, ATTACK, MAKE ME PROUD OF BEING A DEMOCRAT!!
Thnk U 4 Yr WORK! Plse start impeachment process tomorrow. Once cabinet in none will be able to touch Trump. Thx!
@beermeyo When may we expect impeachment?
@SenatorDurbin @SenSchumer Speaking of the Constitution, can you start Impeaching him now? #resist #impeach
@LeslieMarshall @POTUS Let's send that question to a judge in a courtroom and have appropriate actions occur. No more Hillary's
@akmk and just when are you guys going to do the same? I know you see the writing on the wall. Stop them
@MeezerMelodrama which constitution? US checks&balances referenced in our seriously revisionist "constitution" Mrs Yates failed
Another Democratic shill tweeting.
Fired with cause! On her resume. Forever.
@LeslieMarshall @POTUS omg. . The constitution is to protect AMERICANS. Was not designed to give ILLEGALS FULL RIGHTS.
@JChrisPires @POTUS You should have been born on April 1, Casey.
Once again, thank you Senator for speaking out on the side of the constitution & America.
@kevinkcahill 
@POTUS Sally Yates is a hero. So proud of her for upholding anti-discrimination law. Yup, she's a hero.
but what are you all doing to stop this madness
@mrl403568 @POTUS and what will you do to stand for her?
You now have #fascism happening to #America
@POTUS don't let her down by caving in trumps Supreme Court pick
We need you to help with working to find out how politicized Sessions is. Will he serve us Or President Bannon/Trump?
@ActDontReact @POTUS exactly, @SenBobCasey . I agree with you. @SallyQYates is a national hero.
It is against the law for the President to tell the department of justice what they can or cannot do.
on what legal standing Bob???
@POTUS not really good to get fired on the job. Hope she's doesn't need the money. Well at least you're happy about it.
You LIE #NoMoreLies, #DraintheSwamp #LoveMyPresident @realDonaldTrump
. Senator she was fired for insubordination. Her  job was to defend our Constitution  not to make policy!
you keep digging your hole of America hating deeper and deeper,can't wait until 2018 we will not forget,protect us not them
Huh?  She sworn an oathe to defend the constitution and the laws of the land and failed
President Trump is following our Constitution.
@Dascoochie @POTUS Sally Yates, American hero! Donald Trump, Russian puppet. Steve Bannon, human waste. MAGA????
FAKE NEWS
This is shameful. Senator, EVERY representative needs to FIGHT this dismantling of America. We the People demand it!
I disagree
wrong, us Americans want to be safe! You work for us!! #Maga
@POTUS Sally Yates is a hero!  We hope that our representatives on both sides of the aisle do the next heroic thing #impeach
@POTUS
It is fitting--and sad--that the very last act of the Obama DOJ is for the acting AG to defy the newly elected POTUS http://bit.ly/2klqspB  
Come back to Johnstown. We need to talk 
She was wrong on the law and so are you.
You betray the people. She violated the Law & her oath. You Senator have no integrity= political hack & anti secure US!
@TarHeelInNYC @POTUS This creature is not my president! He CHEATED HILLARY out of her rightful PRESIDENCY! IMPEACH HIM NOW!!!
