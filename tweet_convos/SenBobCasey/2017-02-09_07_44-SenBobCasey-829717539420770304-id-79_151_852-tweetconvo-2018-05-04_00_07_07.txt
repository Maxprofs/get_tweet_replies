we're counting on you!
thank you!
Why would he do that?!?
When are you going to FIGHT To Prevent MY SOCIAL SECURITY Benefits from being STOLEN By ILLEGAL NON-CITIZENS??
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
Good for you Roop Case no1 cares
Why? The Baby Boomers drove up national debt. Why should Millennials pay for benefits they will never receive? @SenBobCasey
The president ran on the promise that he would not cut MEDICARE. I need more than every penny I get.
Good! Now go punch Toomey in the taint and make him listen to his PA constituents too! 
How has tha worked out so far ex Senator Casey. It seems you have failed at everything you opposed
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Hands Off! Thanks for Defending Your Constituents. 19026. #Indivisible #TheResistance #DividedEqualsZero
no you won't!  Politicians have been funneling Social Security money for years. Nothing will change!
Quit the fearmongering!! @SenBobCasey
What do you mean @WMS4Yeshua? You don't think @RealDonaldTrump is a huuuge con? Thank you, Senator!
I think @SenBobCasey is more of a con than @realDonaldTrump
lol you DO have a sense of humor!
Thank you, Senator Casey!
Apparently he is planning to tie up federal resources fighting to save his horrible EO.
So with you Senator
to be honest do that to me and the rest of the other the has to be on then you have to get ready for war

@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
Social Security @SocialSecurity says u can get replacement card online. Hassle: Create acct password, hints, etc. Then it just says this: 
the Silver Panthers will too! In wheelchairs and walkers!
he isn't never said he would why bring up things that aren't true. You are dishonest and should be ashamed
Thank you Senator Casey.
how do you know this? Proof.
you mean if the #RepublicanAdministration tries to cut it!

Great! Thanks. Step it up - reckless disregard for rules, decorum, status quo. FIGHT like they do.
Thank you. We stand with you, Senator Casey. When it comes to standing for the common citizen,Trump is a fraud
THANK YOU.
Please do.  I am old and poor and hope you will stand up for us.
I suspect more of his followers will start unfollowing if that happens.
please stay after them to investigate Russian interference in our elections. Don't let this die.
ty Senator #impeachtrump #unfittolead
I NEED YOU TO.  I'm as good as dead without.  THANK YOU FOR CARING
you took Big Pharma bribe $300K+ .. Mr casey your only concern is lining YOUR pockets. corruption at its best SHAME ON YOU
thanks Bob Casey you are our PA Fairness Warrior 
You and I both know it's coming...
I'm on disability & MediCare. I know I won't be for long.
Righteous Repubs could also decline receiving SocSec & Medicare benefits. But I'm sure they have an excuse.
Cut SocSec & Medicare and 65 million people will march on Washington to physically remove @POTUS.
Just like Devos was fought, but nothing you can do while the Reps. outnumber the Dems, unfortunately
We are relying on you to protect Americans from DJT's special interest & billionaire #SwampCabinet
you need to stop talking and get @SenToomey to stand with you on this pledge
ill be fighting with you. That man don't know what injury he would be committing.
I believe the Trump should just be using his POTUS twitter handle. This will alleviate personal vs political.
By all means, keep them on their current unsustainable path, Senator.
Senator - On what issue haven't you fought POTUS on? Kind of a stupid statement.
will you fight him also if he wants to make cuts to welfare recipients who make it a lifestyle?
how can you handle the stupidity?
Thank you, but we need to find a way to stop this madness, not just voice our opposition to it. impeach, 25th.
you could have lowered med costs by voting to import medicine from BUT you didn't. Get to work on that too! PA voter btw
Please fight and win!!! We can't afford any more losses like Devos, Sessions et al
such a blow to us, our economy, our health! How much can these idiots take away from the people? #ImpeachTrump
you have no one to blame but yourself. Because you refused to listen to us, your voice means nothing
And you believed #DonTheCon? You have been CONNED.
Thank You Sir
thanks!  You're the best and we truly appreciate it, but that doesn't seem to help. What are we going to do? #Scared
Thanks Senator Casey, our country needs you to fight for our citizens
Thank you, Senator Casey. I know you're doing everything possible.
@SenToomey @RepRyanCostello Counting on it Senator. From a senior not paid by anyone to voice my concerns.
He is on the record promising that he wouldn't cut those programs. People in rural PA are counting on his word
Keep fighting the good fight @SenBobCasey !!! This #realPA mom is behind you!
Please, keep my social security. I can pay my bills and eat, because all I have is social security.
Good.
Thank you, Senator.  Keep up the good work.
And millions are with u! That's our money not an entitlement! I pay SS every day @realDonaldTrump
Thank you from Pittsburgh. Please fight it all! #2018PaybackIsFemale #ResistanceInPittsburgh
Thank you, Senator Casey!
I have ben paying into SS since I was 15 years old. I have come to count on it to live in my old age.
I mean, @SenToomey trotted out his mother to film that commercial about how he would fight cuts too so united PA!
is a Political Hack. #CaseyStrong

But how else you would balance the budget?
???? 

1) Republicans don't care about a balanced budget, they just added 9 trillion to the debt
2) we could balance the budget easily by cutting the military spending and Pentagon overspending
3) raising taxes on the 1% so they pay their fair share & get rid of corporate welfare
Thanks, Senator Casey!
