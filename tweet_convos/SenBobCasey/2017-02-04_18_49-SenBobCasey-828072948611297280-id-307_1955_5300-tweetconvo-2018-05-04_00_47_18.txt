He's crossed many lines. What do you intend to do about it?
Why is the judge halting this? When Obama did this no one complained.
@Senbo Casey's @realDonaldTrump. Pres Obama Never banned Muslims + Pres O. lots Smarter as constitutional lawyer.
. If  a poor decision initiated impeachment of a Pres, at least the last 8 would have been.
TODAY?  TODAY?
. So  the judge  is  more respected than the president because he ruled in your favor.  The  Hypocrisy
Bullshit. @realDonaldTrump
Senator, you said it very well. Nothing to add except a thank you.
Thank you for having the integrity to say this publicly.
@sawsharee @realDonaldTrump Really how about when Obama attacked the Supreme Court at SOTU?  Hypocrite!
Then do something about it. Trump is a total disgrace and needs to be Impeached
how many lines this individual have to cross before you impeach him? Sell US to Russia?
he's crossed so many lines that if you look behind him it looks like a barcode...
payday you've been stealing from the American people for years GOOD BY SKUNK PISS
That's line no. 54 he's crossed...now who's going to stop him?
IMPEACH!!
Does that surprise you, Senator?  Because it doesn't surprise me.
what do you plan to do?
. I felt safer Before Trump made his hairbrained Ban move + botched Yehmen. Now we're a bigger target for ISIS.
@kathy12985 @realDonaldTrump he crosses the line almost daily and he's not done, he will stoop to even lower levels than this.
I'd looove to get paid! I don't even think any of my friends are getting paid either!
its an judges job to uphold the constitution not to make national security decisions
this man needs to go
crossed the line months ago with his comments on Judge Curial. Trump is dangerous & maniacal. #ResistTrump
but don't judges need to set an example by standing behind our leaders decisions. we are a stronger nationas1
uh no they need 2 enforce the rule of law/the constitution. that's their actual job description
yeah let's read the law.
no we attack the citizens of this country right you quack your just afraid of losing
Ridiculous.  Currently, in this nation, we attack everyone including the President. No respect or cooperation
Today?
wrong again. That judge made a POLITICAL decision.
He did cross a line. A dangerous line. The judiciary is well within its bounds to check pres. power
wake up Casey the left attacks a US President every single day
I applaud your resolve with mr trump.  Please stop him from turning our democracy into a dictatorship.
He wants to keep Americans SAFE.
how about @SenBobCasey worries about getting 1.8 million people in Pennsylvania off of food stamps. Lazy ppl
@PayDownTheDebt this 'so-called' president is 'ridiculous' n #notmypresident #impeachtrump
He crossed the line TODAY?
#highcrimesandmisdemeanors
Not just him, but all republicans that support him. Turning their back on real republican values. Hold them all accountable.
@mcroul @realDonaldTrump The line was crossed way before this statement. Time for more lawmakers to speak out against him.
Trump can't conceive of anyone or anything with more authority or importance than himself!
I. M. P. E. A. C. H. !!!!

"TODAY He Crossed a line" .@SenBobCasey ?!! Where Have You Been 4 Last 2 Years? #NoDAPL #NoBanNoWall #NoACARepeal
.@realDonaldTrump is free to disagree with a ruling, fine. But in this nation we don't attack judges. As President, he crossed a line today.
@rscandarion #ImpeachTrump @realDonaldTrump $100Bilion is #ReasonForTreason #Putinspuppet
Whatcha gonna do about it Senator? The world anxiously awaits courage to stop this Insanity
do not relent on demanding tRump release his taxes. We also demand update on Russian hacking investigation
Senator Casey please cosponsor senate bill S291
he's been crossing the line. You need to keep being the voice of the people who elected you and fight this!
@martin_wolfie @realDonaldTrump He crossed that line months ago with curiel. And that time it was racist.
@MatterFeminist @realDonaldTrump Yes he did. He needs to be Impeached. #impeachTrumpnow
this is what you do all the time. ..now you're the pot calling the kettle black
trump has been on the wrong side of the line for decades...
with what politicians have done to water down the constitution, it's time to blast these calls.
@cattleranch1 with all due respect, he has been crossing the line since he announced his candidacy. He is a pathological liar.
@SenToomey @MattCartwright6 Seems to be crossing lines at least by what he says and tweets Every Single Day. STOP HIM.
@lynn_matney @realDonaldTrump As President he has crossed a line every day! Glad you're finally noticing it!!
dear senator Casey.  Thank you for your service in fighting this insane religio-corporate coup d'etat.
@EvLTxiCaN @realDonaldTrump @GovPenceIN just told @chucktodd Trump's speech is Unique & Refreshing. @MELANIATRUMP approves.
Again, this is the second time he has attacked a judge who disagrees with him.
What does Putin have on DJT? It's GOT to be something!!
Not the first time Senator! Try US killing machine he referenced with OReilly
so we only attack Presidents?? Don't speak out of both sounds of your mouth!
why you guys are attacking our President 
Senator Bob Casey for President!#CaseyVoiceOfIntelligence
thank you senator, at least we Pennsylvanians can reach you and you listen to us,  unlike the other one @SenToomey
he crosses a line every day #impeachTrumpnow #ImpeachmentSoon
@55andwhat ... @realDonaldTrump crosses line EVERY DAY-NOT sharp knife in drawer & he's gonna get us all killed! #ImpeachTrump
agree
Thank you, Senator. Too bad we don't have a finishing school to prep presidents on behavior.
We just attack our @POTUS right? But whatever you do, never attack a #LeftyLib
THIS is the line??! How many lines will he cross before you or GOP do something to stop him?
All he does is cross lines. What are we going to do about it?
Disagree..judges should enforce the law not make it an emotional decision
thanks for standing up for what's right
your right unless your a Democrat then it's acceptable to say anything you want about a judge or President...
he does not respect the office of the president. How can we respect him and his staff?
Agreed. Where was your ire when Pres Obama attacked the Supreme Court in front of a joint Session of Congress?
Sen Casey, TY for saying @POTUS doesn't respect Constitution - the document our Founding Fathers. No dictators
He's crossed that line again and again!  NOW is when the line stays put and I say ENOUGH!!!
I miss you, Sen Casey. <3 (I left home state years ago, so I can't vote for you. Just saying you rock)
@sonyagracie @realDonaldTrump He would have fired him if he could
He also equates the US morally to Russia today.   Wonder how the Trumpkins can defend that?
Lines of the past are gone !!!! Today we are drawing new lines....
glad PA has one Senator who gets it. @SenToomey is sipping @realDonaldTrump koolaid.
all he is doing is crossing lines. #impeach and rid the WH of the rest of his cronies!! #notmypresident
This administration can not deal with disagreements. Comparison to Dictatorships is appropriate
Crossed a line TODAY?!? Many lines crossed in the past year. @GOP Republicans need to start calling him out!
Thank you Senator for speaking out.
Obama attacked the Supreme Court while they were sitting in front of him!!  But that doesn't support your Lib
@NumerologistAli *trump has crossed more lines than the Falcons this year! GO FALCONS! Beat *trump's buddies on the Patriots!
but it's ok to attack the constitution, rights, Starbucks, other countries, privacy, pensions, paychecks?? 
Senator - he cross the line a long time ago.
@Mzeclectic @realDonaldTrump At what point do you IMPEACH? How many lines does he have to cross
*AGAIN
@BalmyBalmer @realDonaldTrump Trump lacks the mental horsepower to make anything other than ad hominem attacks. He's weak. Sad!
Go! Go! Go!  Thank you, Senator Casey!
Thank you Senator Casey for standing up for PA and our nation. The President could learn much from you.
Agree! Senator Casey - thank you - proud to live in PA with a person like you listening to your constituents.
Senator, Thank you for the fight! As a Republican even I can see this guy is way over ANY and Every Line.
face it, he's totally classless
second time. Consequence? None
@221Kohm @realDonaldTrump No Scotus Confirmation. Merrick Garland!!!
@221Kohm @realDonaldTrump Only way to redeem ourselves worldwide is Impeach, not just Rump, McConnell, Ryan, Pence.All top GOP
yes. Yet *another* line.
Just today? Any line crossed can't even be seen on receding the horizon anymore. What are you doing about it?
Thank you Senator Bob Casey for having integrity
@DrMichelleFried @realDonaldTrump so senator let me get this straight freedom of speech doesn't apply to the president REALLY!!
I don't agree with him, but you as a #Senator need to use your position not #twitter. #VeryUnprofessional
Also in this Nation we don't attack our POTUS. Which is what you are doing. Pot call the kettle black much?
He crossed a line attacking a judge,but that isn't 1st & won't be the last.I am concerned about the democracy.
You mean "So Called" president..
here here make a great impact and that will make America great.  #peaceloveandhappiness @The_Dudesons
@nhojhpesoj @realDonaldTrump  What are you gonna do about it??   (Sincerely)
the judge crossed the line
no he did not
The American people have elected a child, propped up by neo-fascists and banks. Very nasty.
@Kim_is__bored @realDonaldTrump he crossed more than a line today-he stepped on all the cracks today siding w Putin
Fight the illegitimate president at every turn! Fight as if our very lives depend on it!
.@SenBobCasey @tadros_s @realDonaldTrump Why double standard: http://www.globalresearch.ca/april-gallop-versus-dick-cheney-court-dismisses-9-11-suit-against-bush-officials/24557 … ??????? #MAGA 
 2/2
exactly
He has crossed a line each day of his questionable presidency.
.@SenBobCasey @tadros_s @realDonaldTrump The "so-called" judges weren't so proactive in 9/11 terror the deadliest attack on U.S. soil. 1/2
I agree.. & always wonder why we don't prosecute #saudi & #bushfamily link tight ties w/house of sau
Bob buddy, he crossed the line a while back, keep up Bud
@elite99thc @realDonaldTrump That's because he is not a qualified...so-called President. He can't even read.
Cross a line.  He has done nothing but cross lines; and this isn't his most egregious crossing.
@RiseUpAbove @realDonaldTrump so when do you challenge president Bannon? Trump is his press secretary
@Gloretired @realDonaldTrump Today?  Are you kidding me?  He crosses the line everytime he opens his stupid a-hole mouth.
#socalledprez
he's been crossing lines since June 15,2015 and both parties have allowed it to go on and on and on......
@bkabumba @realDonaldTrump Ain't seen anything.
just today?? How about this entire broadcast has been a sick demented joke & we are going to suffer
This is only the latest line the #SoCalledPresident has crossed. Add it to a long and growing list.
TODAY he crossed a line? Just today?
O'Reilly attacked a judge on TV and the judge's family went through hell. Later admitted ruling was mandatory.
Senator Casey says in this country we don't attack judges. Oh really, but we attack the President?
@bqbinkc Disrespect to a Federal Judge is unconscionable. There has to be punishment for that!!!
@Laurie_David @realDonaldTrump what's nice is there is less and less bone heads who support trump, too scared or wised up.
today he crossed a line? He's been over the line since day 1. If you realise it now, welcome aboard. #impeach
@TracyB80484834 @realDonaldTrump one of many disturbing precedents he has created, sir.
@ealight461 @realDonaldTrump What are you going to do about it Sen. Casey So far you and @SenateDems have shown you're feckless
he's been crossing the line for 2 years
lock him up!!
Do something about it.
.@SenBobCasey use your political clout, please start impeachment discussions! I'm bearly sleeping and I know I'm not the only one! #Resist
@coasterinoregon @realDonaldTrump a
This was what did it for you? Up to now everything's been ok?
TODAY!!!
@mbeahall @realDonaldTrump He crosses the line very day!
Could you make a statement about Bannon and his role on the NSC?
As president, he crossed a line right after he was inaugurated and gave a speech about "American carnage".
he crosses a line every day
@lorriebellbrook @realDonaldTrump federal judge has spoken. If u don't like the result appeal it. Keep talking &on in contempt
He crossed it long ago, but we feel you!! #RESISTANCE
@PhillyChristian @realDonaldTrump imagine if the judge was Mexican, we know what he thinks of Mexican judges.
Obama set healthy precedent of scolding #SCOTUS in speeches. Were u bothered about this so called line then?
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
you believe that the judge knows more abt our security n the ruling was not rude? Who crossed what?
He has crossed a line every day. When will he be stopped? How tobwe get this threat to America out of office?
@AltMtRainier @realDonaldTrump what? Another line? A red one? Which line is too far?
@HahnAmerica @realDonaldTrump I think the judge crossed the line
and RBG didn't cross the line when she voiced her displeasure of Trump? #Hypocrite
crossd line 2DAY?! Hes crossed so many lines in the last yr there r no more stars on our flag just stripes
@chellelaine He's done it before. Remember the judge with "Mexican heritage?" Of course that was before he'd been sworn in...
yep, attacked a fellow Hoosier!
we don't attack judges?  But we attack @POTUS
He has crossed quite a few during the last 2 weeks. Unacceptable!
Thank you, my senator!! The silence has been deafening. and disturbing. thank you for speaking up!!
you're a senator of a red state last election,come 2018 we're getting rid of America haters like you
we r getting rid of ignorant uneducated American haters like u. & PA is a blue state 4 pres elections
@AltMtRainier @realDonaldTrump And what are you guys going to do about it?
As a nation judges are to be respected. As a nation public opinion is supposed to be considered.
checks and balances all guided by our constitution. Our democracy will not be destroyed. Thank you, Sen Casey
actually we do...they are not untouchable
uhhhh yeah, they kind of are. Unless they resign or commit a crime.
He's left you no choice - impeach him.
Trump quest for dictatorship will cross a line daily - maybe hourly - please block him and his appointees from dismantling USA
well said
he did this by racially profiling a judge MONTHS AGO.
@rappahannockmag @realDonaldTrump Agreed!!
@Melodyyounger1 @realDonaldTrump Finally! Someone standing up ! 
@Bestinshow_Miss @realDonaldTrump He crosses the line every day, and nobody is doing anything to remove him.
he is mentally ill and needs to be hauled off in a strait jacket.
We're counting on you to protect our nation from him. He is the biggest threat to our safety.
, @timkaine @SenWarren @BernieSanders Can you do something to remove this man form Office/Power??? Please!
Crossed over one line? This so-called Pres has jumped the shark.
@jjmplsmn @realDonaldTrump  Senator, your memory is short, remember when he attacked another judge for having a Mexican name.
@SenJohnMcCain @SenateMajLdr FYI https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/videos/837181963086367/ …
You have made America unsafe for political reasons.  How do you sleep at night? The fight has changed. Democrats are the enemy.
ur fellow citizens r the enemy??? How do YOU sleep at night? treasonous traitor. You & ur ilk are a dying breed.
