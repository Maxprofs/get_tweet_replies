My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.
you're one to talk. U supported a rush to judgment and zero due process against penn state. Can't wait to vote u out.
I'm dumber for having read this tweet trashbag.
Maury, these people love their pedophiles. You're fighting an uphill battle here
I agree with you that pedophilia is not good. But PSU Proud people actually love pedophilia
. @SenBobCasey we also expect our president to be a decent, moral man without ties to Russia, but instead we have @realDonaldTrump. Sad.
Opposed to the innocent Clinton's where I learned the definition of "is" & "personal server"?
We aren't talking about Clinton and Trump is using unsecured devices.
and what devices are those?
- YESYESYES.
we're all very lucky this "error" happened with Sweden...next time (and there will be a next time) we might not be so lucky!
so your saying that Sweden doesnt have a problem? People getting beat up and girls raped. CBS had their camera crew beaten
I expect that as well. So, are you as frightened as I am by this madman as well?
remember when it was possible to respect and trust the president? I miss those times.
no I don't
