Which Republican do we need to convince?
, PA needs to convince @SenToomey -- he has been quite elusive but I got through this morning!! #DumpDevos #noDevos @SenBobCasey
I called Toomey last week but I don't think he cares what his constituents think.
vote him out. Tax payers pay his salary. He isn't representing his constituents. #enough
I didn't him in, but he was elected nonetheless & I will continue the fight. @SenBobCasey has our backs
Yes, thank you @SenBobCasey for accurately representing your constituents.
you keep forgetting Trump & Toomey both won our state,you had better get on board & stop your obstruction & American hating
would you hire a guy with no general contracting or carpentry experience to build your home????
please. She has ZERO experience.  Would you hire a person with no carpentry or gen cont exp to build your house?
WI schools are amazing.  False narrative that our schools don't work.
@LibertyBelleJ  Ohio children are depending on @senrobportman even tho he took $58k in donations from her.
good luck with that.
Can you mention to your fellow PA senator that he needs to clear out his voicemail so that his constituents can leave messages?
thank you Senator! Your efforts appreciated greatly.
This is insane. If she gets in, we will remember who resisted when she completely screws up the school system 4ever
If my kids were still young I'd #homeschool them b4 I'd put them in one of her "public" schools
#HoldTheFloor @SenateDems 

@WynGalbraith @sandicast @SenBobCasey https://twitter.com/wyngalbraith/status/828780888905256960 … #holdthefloor
If my kids were still young I'd #homeschool them b4 I'd put them in one of her "public" schools
Besty DeVos's plan will invite a form of SEGREGATION into our children lives. We are a COLORFUL NATION
#KeepPublicSchools
Besty DeAVos view on education is very appalling.Y cant anyone see that she wants 2SeparateChildren by religion race & gender
I just called @OrrinHatch Demanded he vote against DeVos nomination. She isn't qualified!
She's seems very arrogant to me
@Sharmisha14 YOU, Senator Casey, are a great man!  Yes you are!!!!!  Take it
VOTE for DeVos.
Which GOP senators are most likely to see the light? I work full time, can't call all day. (not a paid protestor  )
keep working.  These guys aren't listening anyway.
I've tried, but @SenToomey hat taken his phones of the hook and his vm is full, for 2 weeks now at all offices.
they all have.  I'm in WI.  They should all go!
Mail boxes for Toomey & Mehan not taking calls or voice mails. Now that's real representation!
WI REPS AS WELL.  THESE PEOPLE SUCK.
@Raizing_Cain too late
What aren't they getting?? The public has spoken loud & clear. NO DeVos!!! @SenJohnMcCain @SenThomTillis @SpeakerRyan #enough
Dems look pathetic and Republicans look a basket-case of nuts. How the hell did we come to arguing over this dreadful SecEd?
would you hire a person with an English degree to general contract building your house?
Which one has been bribed with the least amount of money?
@TheCrunchyCap The Repub Senators aren't listening to constituents.  What can we do once she's confirmed?
what about toomey
education before business, before adulthood, before politics, before religion
#VoteNoDevos
games, political games, people should be in a freaking panic, education is the core foundation for your country, #VoteNoDevos
I've heard thousands, millions have phoned to say NO 

"A Government By The People And For The People"

Ugh

#VoteNoDevos
it's really crazy that these senators are not listening to their constituents. I haven't heard many people fighting for DeVos
I called, but my senator, Marco Rubio took money from her - you know how that goes.
@prairiewindspr I called @tedcruz , and @JohnCornyn  today!! #noDevos   #NoPresidentBannon
@Will_Liam_Nerd and one more day to convince a Democrat to allow our government to run the way it was ment to
Thank you! I've called but cannot get through to @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander. They don't seem to care what TN voters think.
People ARE calling - all lines are jammed
I am hoping that there is one Republican who cares about the American people - especially our children! Yes, more calling!
Thank you Senator for standing up for us and the will of the majority of people who did not vote for @GOP & @realDonaldTrump
How about your colleague @SenToomey? Does he answer your phone calls? He doesn't answer ours, but we didn't pay him like DeVos
You can also FAX a letter to his office:  Fax: (202) 228-0284 @SenToomey
How can it not be shown a bribe for office when Betsy DeVos contributed over $60K to Toomey???
@senToomey I know that citizens united made unlimited contributions legal...but is there no public discourse on buying office?
How bout you try talking to one of your 50 R friends one on one??
@LigayaLoyola you won't get it. Politics now it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong. Party lines are bigger than country sad
@Oregonemom Lol I just tweeted the same thing.
our other Senator @PatToomey won't pick up his phone. We will remember
@CleverTitleTK thank you for saying no to very unqualified nominee.
I am. Calling, and tweeting, and e-mailing.
Thank you for putting our kids first! I am here in rural PA and there aren't enough "customers" for DeVos's friends!
who would you recommend? Heller? McCain? Flake?
CALL&tweet ALL 8 Rep senators up for reelection 2018 Senators Wicker, Fisher, Corker, Cruz, Hatch, Barrasso, Flake, Heller
VOTE YES !
What about Ben Sasse?
the NEA bought two Republicans for you. I will keep calling to make certain this is your last term
@MomToBea Protect those teachers unions. They line your pockets. #corrupt
if only Republicans would #showup to listen to the people they claim to represent!
••••what's wrong with Betsy?   Or, do you like the way things haven't been working?
as a resident of PA a democrat,, who didnt vote for you,,  you are changing my mind on you   thank you
senator Casey please stop Devos and ALL those other crooks
..I will vote no on you next election cycle  
:THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT: THIS IS A #NAZIKOCHBROSGOPCOUP WISH DEMS WOULD GET THE PICTURE AND GET SERIOUS!!!!!
Republicans need to break w/ the propaganda-ridden, racist, lying regime of 45, Bannon, & friends. This isn't republican.
No response to constituents via email or fax from @SenToomey  and phone lines always busy. We are trying!
the trump state of pa...we want you to vote for her..ha ha..Trump supporter are watching..
Help convince Toomey! He needs to reflect what PA citizens want, not his $55K campaign donor.
I've called but Cornyn and Cruz are lost causes. #nospines
my senators are cruz and cornyn, so, futile
Thank you for your support!
.@SenBobCasey @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP #CauseAndEffect Hire someone who's an expert in the institution! #GetAnEducation on education! 
.@SenBobCasey: Bob--Perhaps you could pass along Pat's number since his constituents have been unable to reach him @SenToomey.
I agree but you should use hashtags in your tweets!
please confirm DeVos. We need a new voice in education.
since we can't get ahold of @SenToomey can you please tell him the ppl of PA dont want DeVos
Vote YES for DeVos.
why dont you talk to them
@lovehatepolitic number?
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/2/1629046/-Call-your-senator-Phone-numbers-for-every-office-of-every-U-S-senator …
thnx!  Called.
What a legacy buster this one will be for oldest Senators:
Wrecking other peoples’ kid's educational system.
Not going to happen!  She is in...
@left_republic But taking for grntd the power of a mother against someone f*cking over her kid!!!
@left_republic Sadly ALL but 2 are in Devos pocket or afraid of Trump. Anyone w eyes & ears knows she's a sh*t pick.
which ones are leaning?
tell @PatToomey to do what's right for our kids for a change
JUST DID! You can still leave messages with @SenToomey (202) 224-4254
You are ok with an unqualified toad? Of course you are you voted for the so called president
@CapehartJ . Ads running in VA supporting her nomination.  VA 2 senators are Dems.
Sen Pat Toomey (R-PA) is basically no longer taking phone messages. Go to http://toomey.senate.gov  to use email form.
I got through to Pittsburgh office 412,803.3501. I try different offices until I get someone, all the numbers r in my contacts!
@MonicaNocciola   Will call my senators.
They're very good vote counters aka "fakers"-that is what Barney Frank once told me. Just enough "no" to give GOP shred of cred
Please tell us which Senators to contact. Obviously Toomey is a lost cause.  Thank you for all you are doing.
keep up the pressure; we support you!
#bignobetsydevos
@PSEA @SenToomey has been bought & lacks the depth of character to stand up for our schools and children #notodevos #notoomey
@ryan_kravontka for real!!!! No to DeVos
@Shakestweetz Could you please help with Senator Toomey?  He is not taking calls.
done
maybe you should vote yes
@CapehartJ i tried but little Marco's mail box is full!
@jimmyj48125 Which Republican do you thing is more approachable?
How r we supposed to get through???
sad, they couldn't come to that conclusion on their own.
Let's just confirm her
lol let's not let Republicans do it . You all need to stop following the damn antichrist trump
who may be convinced? We need names to push. #education
Bob, Pat doesn't listen to us. Can I challenge him to a duel
May I be your second?
@SenToomey Private sector and DeVos family are waiting for you. You will go down as the biggest embarrassment in PA politics.$$
@NicoleisNik tell @SenToomey to clear his voicemail!!!!
@SenToomey Another billionaire placed on DT cabinet. Pennsylvanians are smarter than this. #NotoDeVos is not qualified 4 R Kids
@SenToomey is proving his vote can be bought. Lying about paid callers...shame on you @SenToomey
@SenToomey will be bought off by the #NotoDeVos family. We Pennsylvania's won't ever forget, and I mean never forget. 
Do not worry Senator 2018 Midterms around the corner, WE PROGRESSIVES are going to give congress the ENIMA they deserve.
how do we get in contact with Toomey??? @SenToomey
We have one more day to convince ALL DEMOCRATS to vote YES on the nomination of Betsy DeVos. Keep calling.
is @SenToomey lost cause? Been trying multiple times/days to convince him to #DumpDevos.
In some cases, it's keep faxing - like your fellow PA Senator @SenToomey
@CapehartJ Do it.
Just tried all of @SenToomey numbers again. VM full again. Please listen to your constituents & vote #NotoDeVos. Follow @SenBobCasey lead
The waste of tax payer $$ @SenToomey won't answer his phone or communicate with any of his constituents. $60K goes along way.
ahem, @SenToomey
I have been calling and attending rallies. Suggestions for more when can do since he has already stated publicly its a yes 4him
@KathrynCroft get it done guys! #noDevos
Thank you, Senator Casey!
Also, the sheer volume of calls, voicemails, & faxes alone urging your colleagues to vote no should be enough...not listening.
We are.  Please help us by providing your colleagues w/ the facts which are non-partisan.  She is unqualified. #votethefacts
Then give a call to @SenToomey because he's not answering his constituents. #VoteNoDevos
Getting through this morning to Sen. Toomey's DC office: (202) 224-4254
can you please tell @SenToomey to listen to his constituents and recuse himself #DumpDevos
Hey Bob, keep pandering to the far left and you will be an ex Senator in the next election.
can you please let @SenToomey know I'd like him to vote no on Devos? He's been hard to reach at his local office.
just tried ha A'town office mailbox is full @SenToomey. I read the fund is up to $64k
Thank you!  @SenToomey Please vote with Senator Casey and say NO to Betsy DeVos #NoOnDeVos
I was able to leave a message on Sen Toomey's Allentown voicemail.
@SenToomey  listen to Senators Casey, please
#ParentCHOICE #Homeschool #Online #Charter We're taking our schools back. #FREEDOM of choice Vote for DeVos #MAGA
THANK YOU for your leadership.
In CO, calling Sen. Gardner.  Is anyone in DC working behind the scenes on a compromise?  We'll give you X for a no on DeVos?
Hoping you can get through to @SenToomey when the rest of us can't!
They are delaying Sessions so he can essentially stand in the way of what the people of the U.S. want.  That is BS!
Too bad @SenToomey is a no-show on the lines. Thanks @SenBobCasey for getting the word out ---->#dumpdevos
.  Unfortunately @SenToomey doesn't have a backbone to stand up to Trump!  Know too many people who have called him-disgrace
Any suggestions on who has some basic human decency and respect for functional government?
Do you have time to read things you vote on since your on twitter incessantly

well said
Republicans are calling too.  We want DeVos, we like the Trump vision.
call toomey he may answer for you
talk to you State colleague @SenToomey who has financial ties to her. Work together to protect PA. Do what's RIGHT.
Is there some sort of mechanism for PA residents to recall Toomey? If he refuses to hear from us, he isn't representing us.
Seriously can we recall @SenToomey this is ridiculous election was as close to 1% as possible what options?
yes, I will. Thanks for the reminder. Have a good day, Senator Casey!
If people have to called to be convinced she is a shitty pick then we're all screwed!
Thx @SenBobCasey Finally able to leave a vm for @SenToomey just now. I've been calling his #'s for days. Pls tell him this is unacceptable.
Can't call when Spineless Pat Toomey makes sure the lines aren't working!
Could you pass messages along to your colleague from PA? @SenToomey has been tough to get in touch with lately.
