Thank you for asking the tough questions.
why would we even think that Trump is going to put people into positions they no nothing about? Past Practices
Your Republican counterparts must Man/woman up and stop this travesty b4 it goes to far &Trump creates his NWO
please stay strong and stand up to the Republicans they obstructed for eight years will follow there tactics.
why do you guys even bother with the hearings, when your coworkers blatantly ignore the responses given during them?
Why are we surprised? This is the norm for @realDonaldTrump and his cronies.
@Thom_Hartmann @theintercept 
Remember Dem. FDR interned Americans??? Yet USA System survives. Love this USA. This just AntiGOP
keep going Sen. Casey!
And yet....they approve him.
who is that idiot in the middle .. oh it's al frankin
Dems well aware of obstruction Learned from GOPs 8yrs of obstructionNEVER 2be forgotten
To tuff-luck: I'd advise U 2 get URfacts straight & I mean not from watching Fox News
.... @alfranken either trying not to laugh, or covering it.... Can you imagine the lies these appointees
weave?!
@SenateDems @theintercept #whitehouse seems like the pope himself couldn't get a fair shake with the dems, give them a chance

.@SenBobCasey @SenateDems Go ahead and say Mnuchin is a racist/against women/misogynist/xenophobe, then lose 48-52 again. Waste of time.
@SenateDems @theintercept @potus lies and more lies! How long will this be tolerated? The swamp has become an ocean!
@SenateDems @theintercept  Proud to be your constituent.
@SenateDems @theintercept Senate needs to do their work for legal Americans by doing their jobs & quickly getting Cabinet in
the longer the Dems stall getting new cabinet together, the more Americans see Dems aren't for us
Papi @SenBobCasey @theintercept you are a sore loser. If you keep doing this to yourself you are going to have a long 4 years
another wasted vote
give a listen and share. i'm a constituent who has voted for you
All you melting do good doers did nothing when gov took over $63B from shareholders on a lie. #fanniegate
This is clearly an administration comprised of liars, cheaters, scoundrels and incompetents. Mnuchin will fit in perfectly!
He will get confirmed and you will be voted out of office. #obstruction
@ggreenwald @theintercept Another day another obstructionist Democrat who can't deal with losing.
@cindy_bogardus @theintercept Block jom!
I am glad you oppose him but who have you tried to talk to on the other side of the aisle?
@SenateDems @theintercept Please do not support this nominee.
@Thom_Hartmann @theintercept lucky for Americans the Dems have a strong back bone....oh wait... they don't
another day more Dems obstructionist delays,we won't forget you're on the wrong side against us hating America's greatness
You know that Dump supporters DO NOT watch these proceedings, right? You have to love the uneducated Dump voter.
@realDonaldTrump my boy doesn't like the truth. It's trump style from now on. Only lies. Deal with it.
In other words, pretty much the same as other nominees over the last 25 years. Check'
@ggreenwald @theintercept Wait now.... this guy is called Munchkin?
it's a shame you need to ask questions with objective, verifiable answers, just to measure the nominee's ability to be truthful
@ggreenwald @theintercept yeah but Alternative facts??
.@SenBobCasey not to mention the lying...
Oppose his conformation!
Says a creature in the swamp.
@ARationalRebel @theintercept He's totally unsuitable for the post. So, he should get it. The madness continues.
Thank you for calling out lies @realDonaldTrump Steven Miller are at war with reality #resist #stopPresidentBannon
another day another dollar Wasted by the Democrats try to unify rather than divide us
@SenToomey  vote NO
sadly the GOP Senate doesn't care, unless they are Democrats
Everyone keeps forgetting that "facts" don't matter to @GOP  #alternativefacts #Lies
Astounding that any intelligent person would vote this guy in! What is wrong with @SenateGOP?
@GOP @theintercept GOP R Shameful in their support of noms along party lines instead of common sense Don't allow DJT to bully U
I don't think it's questionable that Mnuchin is a hideous nominee.
Stop obstructing the POTUS' cabinet confirmations so OUR president can do his job!  The Dems are acting immature.
why do they still get passed through it's ridiculous to watch this I can't wait til we vote these people out
don't hold your breath
so you're saying you're gonna vote for this one too?
another day and you and the rest of the socialist stealing money and not doing your jobs
@SenateDems @theintercept everyone in congress should be stripped of consciences provided by people's tax dollars. Do their job
doesn't matter #pattoomey will be selling us out for the republican party line
Thank you for not taking this lying down. It seems we can't win, but with your help, we can tell the truth, every day.
sen, you needn't vote for any of these.
and the illegality of this warped administration must be addressed
Democrats have lost all credibility.
Draining the swamp ... into the West Wing.
.@SenBobCasey @theintercept Would you know a fact if it smacked you in the face?
fight on!
How about nothing moves forward until we have bipartisan investigation of RU infiltration of .@realDonaldTrump.
@SenateDems @theintercept I'm watching the hearing live and it's frustrating to hear that democrats shouldn't do their job.
@SenateDems @theintercept Says you.  How do we beleive when you lie and mislead so easily
Please consider rephrasing. The clearest way to say "at war with facts" is "lies." Allowing ambiguity in this is dangerous.
PleAse try and talk to your less moral colleague about these issues.  Thank you.
you would be more believable if you didnt have a gripe with EVERY nominee! Cry wolf until nobody listens any more
@SenateDems @theintercept meanwhile you funded the murder of 450 female babies today.
Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to disAPPitchfork everybody you meet.
@SenateDems yet another swamp dweller
all appointments must be put on hold until we can figure out what the hell is going on!
It's no wonder we're fed up with you guys! Term limits are next up. Drain the Swamp!
@SenateDems @theintercept but they will lie not tell everything and still get confirmed.  Frustrated with senate
another terrible cabinet pick! I do not trust this man who has made his living on the backs of hardworking Americans and Vets!
If he made much money from the last recession, will he try to prevent US from policies creating the next Republican recession?
No surprise. But the nomination will go through.
You Dems have cried wolf too many times to have any credibility.
Are we taking bets his ethics form is just another worthless crayon scribble?
@SenateDems @theintercept and then there is Manchin, HeitKamp and others who Dems cannot count on.
@SenateDems @theintercept More lie So! #factsmatter #alternativefacts #resist #persist
@SenateDems @theintercept Unfortunately I do not hold any hope that any republican will do the right thing.
@SenateDems @theintercept he didn't drain the swamp he dredged it and came up with the sludge he calls his cabinet
THE LIES MUST END.  WE MUST HOLD THIS ADMINISTATION'S FEET TO THE FACTUAL FIRE DAY AFTER RELENTLESS DAY.
this is not putting the fox in charge of henhouse. This is razing henhouse to ground and salting earth.
You know the outcome, how about dealing with some issues for a change. I know character assassination is easy but move on already.
Typical DO NOTHING liberal lapdog who makes accusations with NO proof! #HonorYourOath and #ConfirmGorsuch!!
@SenateDems @theintercept isn't that the platform of Democrats? #atwarwithfacts. Big government is better, minority rule etc.
agreed.  @realDonaldTrump and his associates are immoral, corrupt liars that are not fit to serve in our national government.
Hey, good interview on MSNBC the other day, Bob. Keep at it.
another day, another obstruction, another nail in the coffin of the prehistoric Democratic Party. #2018comesfast
If DeVos & Sessions could get in Mnuchin will as well. It's sad when more than half of America doesn't have a voice
We have a voice. Your picks are more swamp people.  They hate America &Americans,  just as you do.
FAKE NEWS! SAD!
@SenateDems @theintercept resist.thank you
Thank you, Senator, for asking these questions. I sincerely hope you get answers. But... not holding my breath.
.@SenBobCasey Lying has become the Badge of Honor of Trumpism. That they get away with it is a travesty.
Another day, another waste of time.  Do something constructive.  #Obstructionist #theyhavethevotes #wasteoftime #zip18640
But yet they ALL keep getting confirmed. Time for the Senators to take a stand. We need ACTION
No Vote. Just another Trumpian Wall St. Banker who was involved in putting thousands of homeowners out on the St.
but he will get confirmed regardless
keep up the fight sir
Keep fighting #Resist
good luck!
Hang in there!
