Thank you! Please keep up the good work!
Thank you.
Impressed U took time to get these #SXSW Majority GOP House&Senate don't even know how many ppl in their own states use ACA!
why pretend you care?  Why dont you have obamacare?
it is a PROPOSAL that ALL Senators should be adding to. Bitching on Twitter while adding nothing shows your character  & value.
you rock!
@MollyBligh Don't forget the working poor. They also get shafted.
Right, even worse. @SenBobCasey
- please tell me someone else is doing this for you. I hate to think this is how my tax money is being spent.
I want the info. Casey is a good guy, and a great Senator!
I want the info too - but not in 67 separate tweets. This is about theater, not information.
Unlike the Republicans theater? "repealing" ACA 62 time under O? And they came up w this?
believe it or not, I'm not partisan about it - they all drive me crazy with their endless theatrics.
.@SenBobCasey is going COUNTY BY COUNTY to explain how bad Trump/the GOP’s #1 Awesome Goodtime Health Plan Of 2017 would be for Pennsylvania
#TrumpCare is such a raw deal for the middle class & seniors that it deserves its own special, 67-county tweetstorm. So here we go.
Wait didn't Pennsylvania help to put this madman in office?
A lot of us Pennsylvanians didn't vote for the madman.
I think the majority of us didn't. My grandma (RIP) could hack PA voting machines.
FEARMONGER WHO WANTS OBAMACARE PONZI SCHEME WHERE HEALTHY YOUNG SUBSIDIZE UNHEALTHY OLD.
What's your point huitecouture?
Those unhealthy old people worked their whole lives, building US 4 U? I call BS.
.@SenBobCasey I'm going to enjoy utter disbelief of PA Trump voters who told me "just give him a chance" when they see these ins premiums
tell them to give it a chance, he says they'll go down in a few years. They have not buy those 35 iPhones they 
This is amazing! Thank you!
Thank you.
your a raw deal that needs to retire
Thank you Senator for bringing to light and disseminating the troublesome particulars of the Trumpcare proposal.
thanks for sharing Senator Casey
trumpDON'Tcare. DonDON'Tgive a shit about middle class.  Don uses middle class
new name for #Trumpcare #TrumpDontCare
59 & #RealPA - Deco. Can barely afford premium now. Thank you for fighting for us!
That's Delco ...
Godspeed, you noble legislator
love the county check in tweets!
Great job, Senator!
@Austrians@westgal51 Let senator n govt refuse there help care and families.. so tax payers can pay 4 healthcare
You left out the poor...the neediest among us.... This will GUT medicaid and medicare and kill women's reproductive rights
.@SenBobCasey  Here's my daughter, Annie McKee.  She has Crohn's Disease, this plan will put her life in danger. Healthcare is not a luxury!
Don't forget, this plan will also give the wealthy a big tax break that they need so terribly? Poor peeps they are?
as a twice cancer patient I will pay more with less care Count this Westmoreland County resident against #TrumpCare
Better known as the GOP's #TrumpDontCare plan. Aka #RyanDontCare & #GOPDontCare
says the same guy that said Obamacare would lower costs. We don't believe you.
great facts for advocacy.  Democrats need to get this one single unambiguous message out there over and over and over.
I tried calling @SenBobCasey to thank him for this tweetstorm, but his office already closed. So via Twitter: this is awesome. Thank you!
@marcorubio @SenBillNelson @RepDeSantis Can YOU do the same as @SenBobCasey? I have #preexistingconditions. #ACA is my ins!
THANK YOU, sir. Live in #Florida. Can you tell them to do what you just did? I have #preexistingconditions. #ACA was my ins.
You should build a calculator where your info can be extrapolated for each county. It'd be interesting to see a map and the data.
This is amazing. Way to represent your state & show real understanding of this new plan's impact on your constituents.
Agree!  #StandWithRand Put into place something better! @RandPaul
thank you for standing up for PA!   This info is so good to share!
@sibenjam Bob, did u drop an 'r'? As in, '67-countRy' tweetstorm? Good thing I love working & am in microbiz or I'd b suffering
its #TrumpDontCare Wealth Insurance
YAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!  GO GET EM, Senator!  xo #Pennsylvania #67Counties #SenBobCasey
you are awesome. Keep it up!
Senator, a TV ad campaign would be welcome now. Reach more people. Remember Harry & Louise, day after day?
I just have to say - I'm lovin' ya' right now. 
May @SenBobCorker, my TN Senator, and a decent, compassionate man, follow suit.
.@SenBobCasey Thank you so much for this #PA county-by-county assessment of the impact of #TrumpCare. #PHL #Obamacarerepeal #NoAgeTax
Obama robbed from Middle Class mortgages to fund ACA>>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fannie-freddie-were-illegally-robbed-204823119.html … Tarp"sters" took our $ & fleeced US!!
thank you sir. I'm sorry that the idiots from Oklahoma are against you in this. Keep fighting for us w/out real representation
The Rs are still on their witch hunt to undo everything Pres Obama did.
Wow. Seriously well done, Senator. Thanks.
Is Ryan actually this moronic? or does he just think we are? This plan is a grave joke!! ACA needs work..but this crap is worse
Thank you for doing this. thank you thank you. Keep fighting this.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Here are some of those statistics you didn't want for TrumpCare. #GreedyOldParty #GOP #Greed #Money
great work! excellent job keeping your voters informed.
If I was registered to vote in two states like all the trumps and his advisors, I'd come down there and vote for you!
Right Bob, The Affraudable Care Act Is Such A Great Deal For US! DEM POLITICS 1st! America, Whatever. @tmims50
don't think it was the best plan but my concern is that it's so expansive how will replacement impact markets
If the solution expands our choices, allows for competitive Free-market vs a top-down Marxist gov-centric one, no prob
the replacement act drops mandate appealing to young citizens who won't buy in, lose strength of large consumer pool
Gov needs to exit private mkts; its primary role, as a referee not an active player: defend US and adjudicate disputes
if you examine case law of past 100 years we are well past that point, that line was irrevocably crossed w New Deal
Have. Disagree. That's a defeatist attitude -- it is never too late; Trump's election proved that.
Thank you so much for doing this!
in case you forgot Mr. Casey, PA hates you.  And we can't wait for you to be voted out.  @NolteNC
Take a look at the stats. What a disaster Republican ideas on health care would be. #TrumpCare
If you are middle class, and/or a senior and a Trump supporter, please, please read some of these emails. That's all I ask. T-Y
is the realest out here in PA rn
@mummievolution Yes; here we go; making America better than ever be4!!!
we need a replacement for the ACA. Long overdue.
@SpeakerRyan Ryan been trying 2destroy life 4 senior citizens as long as I can remember. His mom is a millionaire.
I’d like @SenBobCasey to replace @SenSchumer as minority leader, please.
#TrumpCare is such a raw deal for the middle class & seniors that it deserves its own special, 67-county tweetstorm. So here we go.
you are awesome
Do you think defending #Obamacare is bad politics in the Rust Belt? @SenBobCasey doesn’t.
#TrumpCare is such a raw deal for the middle class & seniors that it deserves its own special, 67-county tweetstorm. So here we go.
SENIORS? No. 55 to 64 yr olds like myself are going to get hammered.
CASEY AT THE BAT - GO GET 'EM
stay strong for us Pennsylvanians. #resist
GOP is trying to ram this through as fast as possible so we don't see it. Fight 24/7. Expose. Go to the people
@SenateDems Paul Ryan is pretty clever. HIS bad Healthcare Bill with Trump's Name on it! "Trumpcare!" BLAME TRUMP! Smart!
@CoryBooker @SenBookerOffice What fresh horror is in store for New Jersey residents?
@RogueED Keep standing up for what's right for the American people
@sunbonnetlee Trumpcare is an act of terrorism against the American people by the GOP and the White House
Fight for Americans Bob! Keep America GREAT! Please don't give up fighting for AMERIANS  don't worrythe Billionaires will be ok
You sir are my hero!  Keep fighting the GOOD fight.
Thank you for all the effort you make for your constituents.
Bravo brilliant
I don't live in Pennsylvania anymore but you've been a great activist lately!

It's criminal people work and pay for ins their whole lives and when your at the age to really need it you can't afford it.SAD!
thank you for informing the public about the healthcare offered by Ryan/GOP  It takes courage to fight power & lies.
When was last time you visited most of these counties to talk to us?! Too busy pushing Dem agenda & meeting with patrons.
How about it, all you Trump lovers who said Trump stands up for the little guy!  Are you FEELING SCREWED YET? You should be!

@RogueED Senator, could you have a word with @PattyMurray  and @SenatorCantwell that WA would like them to do this too? #Resist
you're the man. #Trumpcarefail. #Trumpcare #russiagate #Trumprussia
Thank you for this.
THIS is what Democrat Senators do : CARE and WORK for their constituents. 180 degrees of separation from GOP corp.-owned.
trumpnocare is an abortion
It's more raping and pillaging by the @GOP <--- hates Americas, loves $$$.
@SheWhoVotes Yes, Senator Casey, this Trump Care Is A Cheap-Imitation of the Democrat's Obama Care...In fact, IT IS A RIP-OFF!!
Breitbart calls GOPs healthplan RyanCare. 
White House says dont call Trumpcare. Come on, lets call it for what is, Shitcare!
Keep reminding REP voters it's them too...OUT LOUD! Some think they are insulated from all of this! Or just don't think!
--I live in Oregon, but you're my new hero. I'll volunteer on your next campaign. My daughter graduated from Univ. of Arts 
And if we continue Obama care what will they have?
@SenSchumer @SenGillibrand I would love to have the same info for NY put out like this. It gets a lot of attention!
i think ppl want to go back to the old ways and just not have insurance,waiting for catastrophe or getting healthcare in the ER
- Here we go! Reveal the greed and corruption of the republican upper crust. Friends on the other side! They do not care!
#TrumpDontCare
@rolandsmartin interestingly enough Congress democrats exempted themselves from obamacare. Remember the brain drain comments
If insured through an employer's group plan, even if the employee pays the full premium, the employee won't get a tax credit.
@AuthorDMHoffman I'm screwed!
DonTCare is how we should refer to it
thank you for this! 15217
Wow, this is great information, thanks.

@SenBobCasey
STOP #Trumpcare in its tracks or our middle class and seniors are screwed.
Thank you for speaking out and standing up for us. Keep tweeting!
thanks for the real story
HOLY HANNAH!! A TRAIN WRECK THIS HEALTHCARE ISSUE. TIME 2DRAW N QUARTER THIS ASSHOLE WHO THINKS HE'S SMARTER THAN ANYONE!NOT!
So who is paying for those credits now?  I believe that is the true raw deal.  The country is already 20 trillion in debt.
Thank you for your continued hard work, Senator.
This is great! Every Pennsylvanian needs to see this!
seriously, what's wrong with these people? This will kill people, actually kill sick people who could be saved. WOW
This bill is Horse Hockey. It gives tax breaks to insurance companies and hurts our most vulnerable neighbors.
Ryan should name it CrappyCare.  That is what it is.
This is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
#TrumpNoCare
not just #trumpcare,  it's #republicare.  They all own this disaster.
Remind the missing @SenToomey these counties will all be voting

@SenToomey you are getting smoked on twitter. #hireastrongersocialmediacoordinator
Thank you Senator...I work in Philly, live in DE; 3/4 Senators getting the job done...@SenatorCarper @ChrisCoons
what about Obama care I got left out
you are amazing. Why are we not hearing these sad facts from @SenToomey?
Thank You Senator! Keep fighting. #NOAHCA
appreciate what you're doing here but wish you'd refer to it as #Republicare - this is not just a Trump disaster.
Every Senator and House Representatives MUST be as honest and as forthright as you have been sir!
@MBeckAZ #maga. Thanks donald.
Thank you so much, Senator! This is a brilliant way to illustrate the many affects this debacle will have. #Trumpcare is wrong.
Thank you, Senator Casey. That was very informative.
the raw deal is ur quality and quantity of work performed fir the pay and benefits received. Abysmal
The GOP certainly doesn't care about the people that put them in office.
thank you! Please continue to work for all Americans this bill will undoubtedly will hurt!
Competition on procedure pricing and allow to by across state lines. ins is high bc cost of procedures r insane
thank you for doing this for us and thank you for voting #NoAgeTax
thisnis only due to the change in credits ... still need to take into account the rate changes that will happen to +50
eviscerated the Less Affordable Care Act per PA county, epic 67 round tweetstorm shows cost of age tax #NoAgeTax #Indivisible
When are ever going to be the Senator for all of your constituents! You don't reepresent me sir!
I guess this means I don't have to call your office asking you to oppose it!
you Sir are awesome 
I'm saddened at how many will suffer under Trumps healthcare plan.
I hate it. Want to see holes in the ACA fixed instead. No tax cuts for the rich! Everyone needs to be insured,
Dauphin County Constituent
@mostsmartest I don't live in PA but kudos to you for making this concrete - maybe folks will wake up.
. @SenBobCasey Maybe if #ObamaCare didn't cause rates to skyrocket in PA...
thank you for this Senator. You're a valuable representative of the state of PA.
.@SenBobCasey We had a 53% premium increase under #ObamaCare.
increase to premiums in 2017 was Ave 33%. Small group up 7 %.bought on the exchange about 10% pa market
That's actually not true. Due to survivorship bias, the benchmark silver plan in PA increased by more than 50%.
The surviving plans only had an increase in the 30s on average, but less expensive plans left the PA market.
If you're not familiar with the concept of survivorship bias, Wikipedia is a good read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias …
the hashtag and the bill might be better dubbed #TrumpDontCare
we need help as Americans we can not allow this gut to Obama Care
.@cnn MNS 4 #GOP to reinvent #Obamacare when all they need do is just improve the current #ACA law protect beneficiary coverage
I hope Democrats will start calling it what it is - Republicare - it's their mess, they need to own it and be haunted by it.
can you move to fla!!! Help!!
Go @SenBobCasey Go!!!
I bet they're are pissed off if they voted for Trump
You are awesome
PROPS.
the GOP had EIGHT YEARS to come up with something, and this is it? . #Trumpcare stinks, do better GOP.
Awesome thread!
That is the way to display facts. Hope they see it and get it.
Thanks for making it perfectly clear to the people who would be impacted, were this terrible plan to pass!
@Lee_in_Iowa 
Well done. Thank you for caring about your constituents.
Rule #1 in #Pennsylvania - Never, EVER, take on a Casey. #reputation #factual

Please I beg of you, don't call it trumpcare,  it strokes his ego.
#Chumpcare
Can you also do this for Speaker Ryan and Wisconsin? I know he's busy but I'm sure he would appreciate it.
Go for it, Senator!!
Call it Republicare. This is what they want for the American people because their health care pensions and raises r guaranteed
way to go Senator!
