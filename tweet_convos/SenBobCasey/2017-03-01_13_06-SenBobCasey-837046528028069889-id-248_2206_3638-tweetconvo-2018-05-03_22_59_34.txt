I've asked the Chair of @GOPSenFinance to use his powers under tax code section 6103(f)(4) to force @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes.
TY Senator. There has to be somebody honest enough to do the right thing at least I hope so.
.@realDonaldTrump's conflicts of interest pose a threat to national security & the integrity of our government. His taxes must be released.
In 2015 Rs used 6103(f)(4) to obtain more than 70M individual items of taxpayer data. Time to use power to hold @realDonaldTrump accountable
The @GOPSenFinance should vote to obtain @realDonaldTrump's taxes and vote to make them public. http://www.casey.senate.gov/download/trump-tax-return-letter …

Get over it...there's nothing there
How can you say that? How do you know? We won't know till they investigate.

They did investigate Benghazi ad nauseum.
Nothing there, right?
