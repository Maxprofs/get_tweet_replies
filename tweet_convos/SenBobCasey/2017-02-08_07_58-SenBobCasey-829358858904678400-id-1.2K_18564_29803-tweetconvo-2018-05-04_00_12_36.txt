My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!
Nordstrom should have kept thier left wing politics out of it   My family no longer shops there
@_ctgray_ @OfficeGovEthics MY MOTHER IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN! U R TAKING HER MEALS ON WHEELS AWAY FROM HER!! DON'T DO IT! PLEASE!
@TrulaTener @OfficeGovEthics are you Fucking kidding me you ignore @hillaryclinton Crooks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8SLgf_BCCQ … @POTUS wont!
@dacollar1 @OfficeGovEthics *terribley FTFY.
@RileyKilburg @OfficeGovEthics this is fabulous 
tomorrow morning, Monday first thing, start contacting your elected representatives. http://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep 
make them listen, call them, find out when they have town halls scheduled, show up. Get involved and stop this
I'm ashamed of you being the Senator of our great state. We the People will change that next year. #YoureFired
I didn't.  Don't put family business on twitter.  Besides, it's Ivanka's business.  You look foolish.
@RepJerryNadler @OfficeGovEthics 
Constant and persistent bashing of the POTUS & family has gone too far. Conduct unbecoming!
Thank you @SenBobCasey @RepJerryNadler! Do your job @OfficeGovEthics #investigateDonaldTrump
Lots of great people fail at business.  Don't take it personally.  Free Market =Survival of the Fittest
This is very, very bad. No one wants to buy her ripped off designs.
This has to be addressed and you need to keep pushing. PA resident.
Yes, @Nordstrom, I'm the President, dammit! Demonstrate the proper deference! Assume the position!
@Bmasemath @OfficeGovEthics @Nordstrom
This was a fathers love&sympathy bc the cowards wanted to really hurt @realDonaldTrump
I mean, whatever you need to tell yourself.
Human nature of a loving father ur questioning? Wow, u ppl are low!
@Bmasemath @OfficeGovEthics @realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom
Unethical was $150B Iran deal!
Unethical was Clintons unsecured server
@Bmasemath @OfficeGovEthics @realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom
No,
Unethical was when attorney General lynch ignored 1st amendment
Remember PA  went for President Trump serve your constituients
Geez, did he follow that tweet with a petulant stamp of his foot like a callow adolescent?
@normangoldman @OfficeGovEthics #getoffthephoneandgetbacktowork
.@SenBobCasey .@iowalisa .@OfficeGovEthics Ivanka's shoes have a sweatshop problem!
Please tand up to all Trump family and staff conflicts of interest. #ethicsviolation #conflictsofinterest
RESIST !!!!
It probably won't go anywhere which infuriates me! Kellyanne has been counseled so who would care about dt?
please please pleas investigate
investigate!!!!
You tell 'em, Senator!  At least PA has one senator that isn't Trump lap dog.
@DebraMessing @OfficeGovEthics Show us your taxes.  TRUMP'S share of ivanka's business?
business is business and when you violate the rules, you're fired!
@realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom Thank you sir.
We only just begun! The White house should be held to the highest standard! Very poor job!
President shouldn't have to be PUSHED to do the right thing.  Should be automatic!
This is a violation of § 2635.702 Use of public office for private gain. It's time to punish Drumpf for this!
Raucous guffaws followed by soaring hope for impeachment or indictment. Keep up the great work
Please advise Trump to stop publicly bashing businesses!
Trump's numerous conflicts of interest are sure to endanger our country's security.
please stop the gross conflicts of interest by the Trump family
Wtf?!?! Trump is clearly involved in his daughters business and so is KELLYANNE!
rest assured I will not vote for you ever again It is a shame what you and your fellow obstructionists r doing
She isn't pushing hard enough in the right direction.
#fire @KellyannePolls NOW #ethicsviolation #trumpcrimefamily
so now it's unethical to stand up for your own family?!?
They are hawking Ivanka's crappy clothing line! It didn't sell! You're fired! #GetOverIt
why do we not care about the Russian hacking anymore?
Nice! A man of few words but makes them count!!!
Who cares? You're too easily distracted. 

Focus on 1)Trump's Tax Returns 2)Putin Connection 3)Bannon
is kellyann conway allowed to promote ivanka trumps products on television
Government and Ethics don't belong in the same sentence.
this a sign of a kleptocracy, not a democracy
BS! President has first amendment rights.  Real desperate reach CryBully.  Too bad KAK did cross line.
so, what are you doing about this imbecile?
This is also a big conflict of interest. Please investigate. It is starting to look like QVC!!!
Would be nice if the leadership under @SenateMajLdr would do something.
@yxnting @OfficeGovEthics Kellyanne did some more shilling for Ivanka products this morning!
DT is a bigly crybaby!
You'd think a businessman would understand... 'if it doesn't sell, clear the shelves' .
well, @OfficeGovEthics what are you going to do? And conway also urged people to buy. This is beyond the pale.
That Trump tweet only meant 1 thing, he really want to fuck Ivanka so bad...so sad
Sen, theOffice of Gov't Ethics requires Congress to investigate. That's YOU. No more Mr. Nice Guy, plz! @SenBobCasey
3/Congress, GAO, the FBI, Inspectors General, and the Office of Special Counsel have the authority to conduct investigations.
are you going to so something? Or is this office a farce?
don't bother. Nothing will come of it. They're all in the bag.
Please look into everything this Putin Puppet and his Republican Party is doing to this country. UNETHICAL!
wow unbelievable coming out of the mouth of DT you need to do something he is not well or fit to serve
treated unfairly? Was she detained for 19 hours for entering the store? #perspective #inappropriate
is your dept intentionally ignoring the ethic violations from @POTUS?
https://twitter.com/ReaderAdrift/status/829727074239860737 …
I've noticed that on several occasions. There must be some way of automating an account. Seems dumb to me. What's the point?
bots. trying to spread propaganda. they were used widely in the election, but interesting to see them deployed here
So far, I've seen them tweet click-bait links- I don't think it's political intentionally.
go away, you're an embarrassment to PA voters
You win the internet today Okay enough of this administration being unethical The voice are calling out LISTEN
@realDonaldTrump act lk a president not a  baby. Sad if UR daughter has 2 keep U in line
"pushing me to do the right thing" like off the roof of Trump Tower?
well.. he just admitted that hes usually trying to do the wrong thing.
@PandaJerrrk @OfficeGovEthics @realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom "pushing me to do the right thing" WTF? we r fuckd,thanx Nordstrom!
@georgianne_bone @OfficeGovEthics i wont support those stores
It gets worse. He retweeted it from the @POTUS account. I think you know what that means.
bad
Unfair and hateful
I really would hope you could relate to a father sticking up for a child.  I think your dad would have done so
this is just unacceptable you should investigate further
You are shameful in your abdication of ethical responsibility to the people.
Thank you Senator.
WHERE IS THE ETHIC COMMITTEE? Why is this 1st family allowed to continue with their private businesses? @SenBobCasey @OfficeGovEthics
202.482.9300 Press 5. I did!
This is unbelievable!  Did you see Kellyanne's plug for Ivanka on FoxNews?
obviously its just for show cuz if this isn't unethical that shut the damn committee down now
You can probably keep them cc-ed for most POTUS tweets... Seems like a sane default.
is there anyone even home at govethics? I thought it was a broom closet these days.
@vickscan @OfficeGovEthics fuck trump brand
Good Lord he has thin skin. Can't he separate his job and his family businesses? Pathetic and unethical.
@GOPoversight @SenWarren @SenMajLeader How about Rule 19 when Trump attacks &impugned 2 Senators in one day?
next off 45 will be endorsing cereal... "Before every morning tweet crispy I eat."
Wait - what?  Does our president not already know to "do the right thing"?
thank you Senator
@KellyannePolls Just told people to buy @IvankaTrump 's products.  NO ENDORSEMENTS ALLOWED!

Trump not the 1st president to rush to daughter's defense. Check out this letter from Truman to WaPo music critic:  http://bit.ly/2kTFlQf 
I U
@POTUS needs to relinquish his Twitter acct. His emotional outbursts are comical and inappropriate for a POTUS
when is anyone going to make a move about this..and @KellyannePolls doing "free promo" on Fox News!
.@SenBobCasey @OfficeGovEthics SCRAPPY KIDS FROM SCRANTON UNITE!!!!!
"to do the right thing?" That's an understatement. I'm now no longer her fan.
quick, dissolve the office! And turn off the internet! Can't let people comment on my actions.
@realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom third world crony capitalism Marcos would have been proud of
all capitalism is crony.
Make them do their job, Bob! Good on you! @SenBobCasey @OfficeGovEthics
CC: @OversightDems
@LouiseMensch @OfficeGovEthics Unethical Unacceptable Revoke Election&Overturn 2Popular Vote Electoral College Unconstitutional
1Vote=1Vote=Eqaulity for All Validate Near 3Mil Votes. Electoral College is Unconstitutional!
Thanks! I've been sending these to the wrong department, obviously.
@realDonaldTrump Nordstrom's made a smart biz decision. LEGAL & ETHICAL. But U don't care about the law.
question for once he told the truth he needs to be pushed to do the right thing OK misogynist  sexual abuser?
Made in China dude!

Build the wall! Around Trump. Seems he can't stop himself behaving alternately like spoiled toddler & mob boss
@xoxoLizza @OfficeGovEthics  Add KellyAnne to that list now .. Office of President  looking like #Grifting101
Only a fool wouldn't recognize that the Nordstrom move is political; it's picking on the prez' children.Not OK
This Philly girl will do everything possible to make you a 1 term senator. Obama destroyed coal with comments.Hypocrit.
Trump has repeatedly violated ethics clauses of the Constitution, a FELONY. INVESTIGATE NOW.
. @SenBobCasey @OfficeGovEthics the number you have dialed is no longer in service #AMDG
@SgtSabs @OfficeGovEthics @TulsiGabbard

You gonna go after war criminals, or?..
http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/rDTxS …
Pls investigate!! @BeauWillimon @womensmarch @GloriaSteinem @RevJJackson @_juliannemoore @ReallyMarcia @rosie
this has gone too far!  Do something!!
Trump and his family as well as their friends,are using The White House to line their pockets/ businesses
How much crazy things does this president have to do to get an ethics investigation huh?
everyday is crazy! Check out trump tweets this morning. #insane
Just went & read them. It's unbelievable that we have this man as a president. Attacking a war hero.
Get em, Bob! You're the man!
Ethics violation for sure .....
Why must 
1 be PUSHED 2 do the right thing?????
We all should just do the right thing,ya think?
Do we let trumps tweet just pass by? & Kellyann promoting Ivanka's clothes on Fox? Violation of the law!
Please add @KellyannePolls  for violating § 2635.702 Use of public office for private gain.
@KellyannePolls (a public employee) just shilled for @IvankaTrump products on @foxandfriends   #LOCKHERUP
Surely as POTUS, @realDonaldTrump can do what he wants? He has so far,,, DEMs need a better defense.
You can add Conway promoting Ivanka's products to that.
if she's pushing him to do the right thing, it's not working
I am appreciating your boldness. Are ready to be more (seemingly) radical? It is & will be what is necessary.
Anything here you may need to look at?
our general counsel addresses the exemption in ethical standards for POTUS & VP here:
@realDonaldTrump watch your back Mr President there are snakes in the White House and government I don't trust them!
this crosses so many lines of ethics@donaldtrump
the republican administration doesn't support a livi g wage!
Kellyanne jumps in as a senior advisor to the POTUS - tells people to "go buy Ivanka's stuff"!
He has to be pushed to do the right thing???  Sad.....Bigly Sad...
now Conway is on fox telling ppl to buy ivanka brand. R u serious
I hope you file something officially!

I think it is time to drain the swamp& you are part of it. Time for you to go & let a real American sit there.
@RepJerryNadler @OfficeGovEthics America has been treated unfairly from The trumps
Can't you have a deep discussions with Pat Toomey and how detrimental his yes votes are to US?
@RepJerryNadler @OfficeGovEthics #impeachTrump
Wahhhh..winer
Are you against free enterprise? Why are you against fairness? Why do you hate the @POTUS so much? Deplorable!
If this were Hillary about Chelsea, you wouldn't have a problem.Right you & Clinton's, suck the tax payer teet
.@SenBobCasey @OfficeGovEthics please act with all possible means
waah waah waah... Sounds like poor people who are denied food stamps. Chin up.
I think that your days as a senator are numbered.  All of you are unethical when it comes to decency, truly.
Don't forget the same tweet from POTUS account. Thank you
@IvankaTrump did nothing to deserve poor treatment and he has every right to defend her. You'd do the same.
Thank you Sen Casey. This is on both his personal account and the @POTUS account.
We'll done Senator. @GOPoversight you should be reining him in. @Nordstrom you should be suing him
please; someone,anyone, INVESTIGATE!
Bob, your "so called" colleague, the illustrious hand-cream salesman Chaffetz will block that one.
@JohnnyZito @OfficeGovEthics president snowflake
My tax dollars are not paid to help our so-called President promote family businesses.
Defaming a business or a Judge's qualifications ('so-called judge') would that be grounds for lawsuit?
I guess boycotts really do work. Everyone cried foul when it's their team.
@megkwall @OfficeGovEthics if you think @jasoninthehouse will do anything, forget it. Jason is a hypocrite & Trump kiss ass.
thank you so much for your voice!
@realDonaldTrump apparently she hasn't pushed you hard enough or close enough to a cliff.
Thank you for doing the right thing, without being PUSHED
@nukacola11 @OfficeGovEthics @realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom He means it's terrible that she is always pushing him to do the thing.
Wow! He's blackmailing us. Either Ivanka gets Nordstrom back or he won't do "right" thing.
Then she should push him to step down - immediately.
