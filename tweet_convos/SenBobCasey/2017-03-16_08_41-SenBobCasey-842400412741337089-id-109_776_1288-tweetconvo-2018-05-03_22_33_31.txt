45* budget plan will negatively impact seniors, children and disabled civilians & Vets
my god democratic's stop it your killing me you forgot the abandoned animals try again
@JMS155 @realDonaldTrump Senate approves budget. They need to protect our most vulnerable citizens or pay the price at polls.
He's also cutting thousand of jobs with the same budget cuts. How will he "grow jobs" by starting in the hole?
democratic's should thank trump for baling them out of something that would destroy millions of Americans
lol try again schumer the American people have listened to your lies long enough
SEN. YOUR DAD IS ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE ABOUT YOU!  SO SAD!
Thank you, Senator. Please continue to work for average Americans and protect our environment.
Well if @POTUS acted like a republican he would be repealing it with zero replacement. You rather have nothing?
they would rather keep the Obamacare taxes, and have the working class pay for all the dems free stuff
Typical democratic senator who has no bills only rhetoric! Blind to Obama care failures!
Budget: Corporate welfare codified.
I think you're very confused. Trump hasn't done anything except screw ppl & make $ for himself
screwed middle class, woman, immigrants... makes money on maralago trips and Melania at TT
his health plans - anti woman. Defund PP - anti woman.  Plus How he speaks to and about woman
gov funding doesn't cover abortions
Fight him every single day!
really? Projection already have us saving? What vital program?
programs should have been cut a long time ago
Very true, Senator. As a PA resident, please keep basic programs. No telling when any of us need help.
Feed kids or build a wall? 
#NoBanNoWallNoRaids
@Enrico056 @realDonaldTrump y z everyone so surprised. He's a salesman say something to your face & sell your sole behind u
Appreciate everything you do to minimize the damage from this narcissistic sociopath in the White House.  Keep fighting!
stupid trumpsters don't even realize as they dance at his rallies
@TruckersVote @realDonaldTrump better start working for the people Not Trumps Dynast They may b living like the poor.
It took me not even a minute to look at that budget If reps. vote that in they r done.
@TruckersVote @realDonaldTrump He's trying. He can b stopped. Unless the Reps. want to see 100% Dems in next election they...
I'm sick to death that this is our Country right now.  It becomes more unbelievable daily.
@LoucksSteve @realDonaldTrump take away his passport. If he can't visit his wife Putin...#Trumprussia
To defeat this, it must be framed right; call it what it is. Trumpâ€™s Budget: Economic Terrorism
He thinks they are bargaining chips, his negotiating style, draw extreme position, then give back small increments
DT cant b allowed 2 slander PrezO promise lies take food heat & services frm needy & HC frm those who have&need it.Get him out
It isn't all tax cuts for the rich, some of it goes directly into his pocket via Trump Organization #Conflict
Comrade Trump just wants to fill up the private prisons
An aircraft carrier costs 4.5 billion .  A Meal on Wheels is $7.15 x 200,000 meals = 1,430,000  #Cheapskate
Nice Bob. A guy who is not taking a Presidential salary and pays a 25% tax rate is doing this for the rich!
So...9 trillion dollars and a new president later, and decreasing the deficit is suddenly a priority of yours?
your idea of vital programs is our idea of govt waste,we need term limits on you spenders for 2018
why must money for boom boom come out of already beleaguered social services and arts and culture programs?
Meals on Wheels?  DT, you are a cold-hearted, greedy, misled twit.
I don't recall seeing a budget for the past years. Where have you been, congressman?
bull. Quit drinking the kool-aid fool.
if you want to reduce the deficit start with defunding Planned Parenthood - the nation's abortion mill
your message is sad and tired Sen Bob. Think of something else to complain about
I thought it was to find our decimated armed forces.
Why is govt supporting one radio station over another?
Hey @realDonaldTrump the democrats would rather you do a #FullRepeal with no replacement. Let's do that instead.
#BenedictDonald and the GOP ain't repealing shit.
Not necessarily a direct relation with all due respect, Sen. 20% military & 70% social. Where else to cut?
don't forget the increase on the already overpaid Defense Dept. !
"Vital programs". Code for tax dollars given to deadbeats.
@MuffinMcEgg @realDonaldTrump Please fight for our programs that help the American people live healthy and enriched lives.
@stevegates62 @realDonaldTrump What do you expect when you nominate 5 guys from Goldman-Sachs?
Thank you for protecting us all
Any thoughts on how to salvage LIHEAP and weatherization programs?
AMEN!
it should be illegal to hoard money as they do.  It leaves very little for the rest of us
Can you not figure out any way to save our money? Democratic talking points is all you have.
@snowflakeunited @realDonaldTrump They want us dumb, poor, sick and preferably dead.
. @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Bob u don't fool us, such a liar! Try writing a state budget 2 cover ur own costs doofus.
Tillerson says State cuts okay bcuz fewer military conflicts then why more money to military #trumplogic
@RepDwightEvans @realDonaldTrump Needed change  from thus to be taken to supreme Court, Bm.
trying to  change supreme Court ruling  fought over for yrs; step in needed ,Bm.
didn't putn@ real Donald Trump were that come  from?,Bm
@RepDwightEvans @realDonaldTrump cutting laws to our Constitution already implement, bm.
why do you have trump on here?
This won't stand. I hope you fight it.
Thank you.
Correction; he's cutting vital programs to fund tax cuts for himself & his family. If it benefits him, it's 
Stop your LIES! This is only a partial budget.  You're turning into a true blue Democrat.  (Not a compliment)
- #TrumpCare
@marklanegan @realDonaldTrump Precisely same thing happening in UK... no wonder our PM trying to be Donald's best pal... 
thank you mr casey  impeach trump
... and a huge increase in an already bloated Pentagon budget.
These cuts are evil enough on their own, but $54 billion increase to defense budget larger than the next 7 countries combined?
Are you all so happy with the US being $20 trillion in debt? Casey is lying. Budget will cut deficit.
all for the rich/he doing this 52B military build up for his war? He sees himself as a great plastic soldier
Keep fighting for us Bobby C !!
Bob. You're such a prevaricator!
#weakdonald is out of touch and doesn't care about the American people
He and the GOP continue to show they don't care about the poor/marginalized/underserved
work with your counter parts in fixing America. 45 is only as strong as you allow him to be.  Help America 1st
Thank You Senato Casey, no thanks trump
Please keep speaking truth and reason.
And the military.
social security is our money. Pay back what's owed and give us the raise that y'all give yourself. Its ours.$$
He is insuring the wrath of more Americans on him and the GOP party and more deaths in America. @realDonaldTrump
Obama care has issues that can be worked out. Find a way to fix it. Work together on both sides of the isle.
The budget will however solve his "refuge/immigration "problem." bcz ppl will no longer want to come here.
For vacation either. Trumps ban is killing the travel industry already.
And to build his military regime.
#POS45 already raping citizens economically 3$mill/trip for FL golf 1$mill/day for TT#GoldenShowerTower 
I'm concerned about the cuts/funding regarding lands. I hope they're not planning to rape our National parks for oil & $$$ 
thank you Senator. Please act to stop this gutting of our society
he is destroying us. I don't understand how everyone doesn't see it. He is NOT #MAGA
agreed. @realDonaldTrump is an immoral liar who'll do only harm to ordinary Americans, to our economy & our security #TrumpLies
Oh Bob, he doesn't care. The Ayn Rand inspired @HouseGOP and @SenatatGOP do. not. care.
No surprise there.
Thank you!
