Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
Great All emails from Clinton, Podessta, Schultz all could be made public. I would love that How about you?
The Don seems really touchy on this subject. I don't know why?
LIKE ME HE'S FED UP THE DEMS R JUST GOING NUTS THAT HE IS THE FIRST "PEOPLES" PRES & DOING GREAT
@VashBandy @realDonaldTrump love you Senator Casey!!!  so does @TuesdaysToomey
aren't you in the Senate Senator Bob?  Why don't You initiate it?
Seems like "the lady doth protest too much". Blasting media & intelligence are viewed as diversion tactics!
completely agree with you Senator Casey
Not sure why him and others don't want to investigate.  Maybe because will implicate their duplicity?
Most Dems just don't get it. An real investigation into Russia will prove Dems were behind it.
Weak argument; find the truth regardless of party.
Idiocy & lies reigns supreme.
thank you always should have investigation no matter the side. May hate result.
@Franield AMERICA NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP ARE HIDING ABOUT #TRUMPRUSSIA. IT IS OUR RIGHT!
why can't congress demand investigation?
agree,  The reason is @realDonaldTrump is a meat puppet for Putin.  Putin is pulling the strings, not Donny #TrumpNotFitToServe
HAHAHA! As opposed to the leaks Trump loved & requested of Russia & Assange during campaign?!
Ted Kennedy wanted Russia to interfere back in 84. And it's obvious Pres Trump was bng facetious
EXACTLY!!! People who have nothing to hide hide nothing
like Hillary?
NOT fake. Cabinet and campaign staff feature lots of Russian friends. #FollowTheMoney
@marcylauren @realDonaldTrump says the people tht don't wnt stop n frisk r guilty...what's it say about opposing investigation?
that's right! If there is nothing to hide, why be afraid of the investigation! Only guilty hide!
You can't imagine why..??? A joke, right? We all know why. It would end his Presidency. #guiltyaf
exactly!
senator bob Casey the great defender of a corrupt democrat party in transition to socialism must be very hard
Exactly
Trump's obsessive tweeting on this assures me he is guilty.
the only way to get the truth out with the fake news
Or his (and his "former" corporation's) tax returns, senator Casey. #FollowTheMoney
it all goes straight back to CGI. U know the 96% of Hillary's contributions went 2&pay no tax
you know all about this too America doesn`t need anyone else just you. where have you been answ. man
@JLownLaw @realDonaldTrump really? Really? You can't imagine why? Perhaps, sir, your job is too big for you.
So now money laundering cozies up to big oil in the Trump cabinet. Thanks for the Ross vote, Bob #oligarchy #vichydemocrats
@SenToomey Senator Toomey should join in a united call for independent inquiry. -PA Constituent
talk to your republican senators about that. Tweets won't help us
because imperial president cheeto knows he's guilty of treason!!
I cannot trust a winner who acts like a loser. I have never in my life heard a winner talk about "fair"
will you stop the BS and actually do something other than waist my tax dollars.
fake news is not as easy to pronounce as racist. The good ol' stand by when you got an invalid argument.
WikiLeaks has proof Russia had no part in why YOU LOST. Hillary proved how desperate and corrupt she was to wn
YOU  ARE BROKEN RECORDS ALREADY. FBI SAID NO CONSPIRACY EXCEPT HILLARY'S GIVING RUSSIA URANIUM NOWTHAT'S SCARY
Thank you Mr. Casey. If the results were reversed we know there would be a special prosecutor. Go for it.
exactly. If he has nothing to hide, he should welcome an independent investigation.
Releasing of his taxes would be a good start!
because he's guilty....the man doth protest too much. Plus all roads lead to collusion with Putin and company
or @SpeakerRyan or @jasoninthehouse - of course if they knew...
So what is involved in getting special prosecutor?  I think I speak for your constituents when I say, "Let's DO IT!"
someone unbiased & works to get all the facts. Beholden to nobody without an ax to grind. So who is such? No1
Fake news and I am sure you know it - stop wasting our time and money
Fake news has become a lovely buzzword for the enraptured masses. It is easy to pronounce. #eyeroll
It sure is easy for us deplorables to pronounce.
it must be, since you vomit the words constantly. But don't call yourself deplorable. Super rude.
then do your job and fix it. @realDonaldTrump
please tweet your next town hall meetings,many want to question your Alt Left answers to problems,chicken?
Please continue the push!!  There HAS to be a special prosecutor.
This so-called president is afraid of what an investigation will reveal. We need an independent commission.
Donald, did the Dems lose bigly--I read where they won by2.9 million.
Exactly! If it isn't real, logic would dictate he'd want to prove his innocence.
@JJohnsonLaw @realDonaldTrump 
And the stupid CIA....and FBI who won't denounce it....and that dossier....and all that evidence
Can you clear up the Human Trafficking issues from Trumps meeting last week? A lot of nervous people in DC
Special prosecutor needed. Call on fellow senator @SenToomey to support independent investigation.
How about his tax returns.
Full, independent and transparent investigation is essential. I don't trust congressional Republicans @SenToomey
and we don't trust the witch hunt Democrats are notorious for.
Hey. That sounds like a great idea. Let's have a special prosecutor confirm what Donald says and move on !
can't imagine? Really? Doesn't actually take much imagination. Need an independent investigation.
we all want to know...good time to release your tax returns, show there is no connection..unless there is one?
@JJohnsonLaw @realDonaldTrump this is all going to come to a head at some point , it may take awhile but it will happen
thank you for standing up to this independent panel is the way to go let's just do it and find out what's going on.
@RepDwightEvans @realDonaldTrump thank you Senator Casey for standing up to find the truth. PA is proud
I can imagine why he doesn't. Guilty Guilty Guilty
sounds to me like he has something to hide.
Weren't you were elected to serve the ppl of Pa? Seems like the only thing u do is respond to @POTUS tweets!  #DTS
2nd way: Independent Commission a la 9/11.
@NoFascistsPls @realDonaldTrump unless of course he's guilty of something, then that would explain why he hiding them.
@NoFascistsPls @realDonaldTrump he could easily do that by releasing his tax returns and put this all to rest.
Bring back Kennith W Starr
#SpecialProsecutor
We will keep hitting him on this. We know he's hiding something. We need the truth
Impossible to MASK election defeat with fake news.
He doesn't want Americans to know he won the election with the help of Russia. Not a legitimate POTUS
Maybe Trump's like OBAMA:  eg:  Benghazi, Fast and Furious, IRS persecuting conservatives.
why not get this done then
there are numerous reasons he doesn't want to clear this up. They all have to do with him colluding w/Russia
WTH have Republicans done, putting this weird,  world wide laughing stock in the WH? He is positively bizzare
If nothing to hide, why work so hard hiding info?  Please work on bipartisan investigation.
Pravda?
#agreed! even @DarrellIssa agrees. Maybe a bipartisan effort that no matter the outcome shows why #USA is true #democracy?
No such thing come off that high horse Potus  stop all this talk about the defeat that's over move on!
Thank you Senator Casey for standing up and being a true Patriot!
Thank You Casey !! 
Executive & Legislative Branch COMPROMISED !
MUST BE INDEPENDENT & or JUDICIAL !!
17339
Because little Donny is a sleazy conman and a fraud. He knows it. We know it. He knows we know it.#TrumpRussia
if it is all "fake" then he should be demanding independent investigation!
Sounds logical to me!
Special pros, 9/11 style commission. No matter what we need independent investigation and the truth!
Yes, a special prosecutor so that Senate committees cannot hide the facts from the public!!!
Trumplethinskin is afraid when the layers of the onion are peeled back it will be rotten
Adjust that tinfoil hat, Bobby. It's cutting off the circulation to your brain. @realDonaldTrump
who is looking out of us while he is in bed with putin. I don't feel safe.
(@davidfrum) says an independent commission would be better.
I'm confused as to why we wouldn't have both.
if hrc did a third of this they would be drawing up impeach papers. Why is this taking so long.
