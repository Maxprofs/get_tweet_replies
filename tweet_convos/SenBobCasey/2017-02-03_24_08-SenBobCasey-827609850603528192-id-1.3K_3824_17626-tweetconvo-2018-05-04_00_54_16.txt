@SenToomey is listening! The majority has spoken! 35th in the world in education #MAGA
they let you graduate from Penn thinking 62 million is a majority compared to 65 million, lmao
No way to 270 remember!? Calif. doesn't choose for all! #lameargument
Regina, what number is higher: 65,000,000 or 62,000,000?
what doesn't matter lol #ElectoralCollege
please answer the question, Regina: what is a higher number, 65,000,000 or 62,000,000
you first
and will remember that come reelection! U did it just bcause unions backing u what a shame! Not good 4our kids crap u r doing!
We the people, want Devose in. You better confirm her. 2018 is coming up fast. You will loose your seat if you don't confirm.
who is Devose?
nominee for Secretary of Education.
I thought that was Betsy DeVos? Who is Devose?
can you please have some words with Sen. Toomey????
@SenateDems Well done!!! Scranton is amazing for two reasons now!
That's too bad and will be remembered on election day.  Vote yes for Judge Gorsuch.
thank you for fighting for public education and ALL students
Didn't you ever go anywhere and find a cashier who couldn't make change? If the read out doesn't tell them, they can't do it.
Thank you thank you Mr. Casey!
#Hack!
@SpryGuy thank you
looks like nobody cares about @SenBobCasey's opinion. lol
I am voting NO ON YOU IN 2018
Although you have done things that are questionable I appreciate your NO vote. My kids thank you.
if our federal funds get cut because of your sanctuary city declaration,  I hope to see you in court.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for voting NO on DeVos! Let's not dumb down our education process.#NoonDeVos
THANK YOU!!
THANK YOU & ALL @SenateDems !!
Thank you, Senator.
thank you Senator. Please talk to your fellow PA rep, remind him country before party.
I am contracting you for the confirmation of the Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch. I am one of your constituents in Pa. If U won't
If you had voted yes, you would be putting the students of PA first, rather than being an obstructionist.
you don't represent the people you represent.  We voted for trump!  Will fight you getting voted in the future!
obviously you are under contract with the PSEA. And another question why do all politicians send there kids to private school?
Thank you for your work
Then we'll be happy here in PA to vote in someone that will work for us. Division isn't helping things, ur against us not w/ us
Thank you for voting against DeVos.
Thank you for standing up for the children!
@ActualEPAFacts Thank you Senator.  Take note @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander @RepChuck the people are watching.
another good for nothing thats trying real hard to ruin this country afraid going to lose his big pay
Thank you for your No vote. If you happen to run into @SenToomey, pls tell him all of #realpa is looking for him
@cwcarpenter2001 Thank you, Senator!
: TY for putting PA school children before DeVo$ and Koch brothers. @SenToomey sold us out for 60,500 "silver pieces" #NoOnDevos
THANK YOU! get @SenToomey on page!
thank you Senator Casey.
Thank-you for standing for PA's and the country's kids! It's hard to keep up hope at the moment, but your commitment is helping
Did you tell @SenToomey that he's voting for a plagiarist who bought her cabinet position? He won't talk to us.
he talked@2 me & HE did the TIGJT@rhing ' voted YES
Thank you, Sentator, for listening to your constituents.
REMEMBER THIS: The education system is not working. Ranked 35th with the highest costs, and inner city kids can't read/count.
What can we start doing right now to get this man reelected? Happy to have a senator that stands up for our children.
@RedAnneBolynn thank you!
Please Stick to that pledge, Sen. Casey. No more brown nosers on the Dems side.
well done!

@ActualEPAFacts Thank you
And I will VOTE NO on your re-election............
Thank you Mr. Senator.
I'm one of your constituents.  Thank you!  Perhaps you can talk to our other senator about DeVos.
Thank you Senator!
I stand by you. I voted to trash her nomination. She shouldn't have been on the ballot in the first place.
And we will vote NO for you. How much money does the Teacher's Union donate to your campaign? What other perks?
THANKS YOU SENATOR CASEY

Thank you, Senator Bob Casey from Addison Texas
Thank you.  Now get one more Republican to block this evil pick.
and you will be remembered for that vote.  Thank you.
thank you for voting no senator! her inability and unwillingness to answer questions is enough for me to question her.
Good move, don't give poor minority kids the opportunity for a better education, their parents want it, who do you represent?

thank you!  Please ask @SenToomey to join you. She is the wrong choice for our children. I'm a mom of 2 in 19067 #noDevos
thank you!
great job
Our children thank you!!
thank you, Senator
@djmincey11 Thank you!
Thank you for listening to your constituents & doing the right thing.
it's all about teacher union $$$$$/votes just admit it
Thank you.
Thank you! You will always have my vote because you are fighting to protect us!
who can we contact on the Republican side to get that third Republican NO?
that means you voted against minorities opportunities to have more of the same choices in education your own children do.
@JadedCreative 
Thank you!
Thank you Senator! 
Please use your powers of persuasion to work on some Republicans to change their mind. Maybe @SenAlexander ?
keep it up!!!!!
Thank you Senator! We know there was a better choice that Republicans could rally around w/Democrats
thank you for standing up for our children's education
thank you, Senator!
@SenateDems all you libs and teachers union members still don't get it, that's what makes me laugh. Casey should remember 2018
and I'll vote "no" to you in 2018!
Thank you for your support. Pledge a thank you donation!
Thanks for voting against this highly unqualified person! #DeVosvote
Thank you!
Thank you! Please encourage your honorable colleagues to vote NO on Betsy DeVos, thank you.
snd i will vote your ass out the door
She plagiarized (cheated) answers during the hearings. This should be the closing point to every speaker over the next 24 hrs
.@SenBobCasey @helenmag Thank you, Senator Casey.She is manifestly unqualified - this from someone who spent 50 years as an educator
thank you Sen Casey. I was I volved in education when my kids were in school, now w/my grand daughter.
yeah but try to do more. Maybe call some GOP senators to sway them. Make a deal maybe? You can DO more. Just talk right now...
Proud to have one senator concerned about qualifications of appointments, education of our children & the voices of the people!
thank you Mr. Casey! Our children and constitution thabk you. Charter schools are not the answer
Stay strong!
Thank you!
thank you; we appreciate and take note of you efforts on behalf of the people of PA
thank you for voting no. U can bet @SenToomey got the same number of calls u did. He just refused to answer!
You should look at wat  voters  want  , vote cabinet yes
thank you for listening to the people.
Thank you Senator! Great job on today's senate floor. Any chance on buying Toomey a drink and sharing your (our) concerns? 
Thank you!
THANK YOU
