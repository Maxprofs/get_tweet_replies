Using cell phone flashlights to better view confidential documents isn't a great idea. http://wapo.st/2koqNEp 
no, honey, sanctuary cities is a "truly dangerous " practice.
now be honest. No matter what he does, you're gonna bitch about it. Why don't you get a life?
actually it is, he's doing everything he said he would. Snowflakes don't like it, but we had to suck it up for 8 yrs, so...
you can hope and dream and listen to all the MSM you want, but HRC WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT.
@LorraineJDion @realDonaldTrump Right now, so-called president is dancing between rain drops. Soon, deluge arrives. #BuhBye
So what is congress doing about it?
Keep us safe.  Time to pick a fight.
@pbump I wish u showed concern about HRC's casual approach to national security- u have lost all credibility.
Your approach to boycotting hearings is dangerous!  You're in lockstep with Obstructionist Schumer!.
@LMplusG @realDonaldTrump so many more issues. Trump's Android? Could be used to explode
youre kidding, right? This has to be a joke! According to libs: Trump damned if he does/damned if he doesnt!
we are promised an expensive wall and a travel ban for "National Security." But POTUS is our biggest threat.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump @pbump @washingtonpost and yet again the eunuch senate will do nothing
so is putting a private server by your toilet but you guys didn't give a shit then
why does he not do state biz at WH or Camp David? Wedding guests, waiters - are they vetted?
wondering when the GOP is gonna wake up and smell the coffee. Hopefully soon. Keep pushing senator. The swamp is deepening
Had this been HRC she would have been excoriated by the @GOP & @jasoninthehouse would be investigating in perpetuity.
the level of hypocrisy is surprising even when you expect it.
Please make U. S. secure, again! No phone calls in crowded room or "football" being photographed. Respect job.
He's going to get us killed.
But...Hillary's emails... #resist #impeachTrump
@DavidYankovich   Senator, he has no security or diplomatic experience. He was elected by people who also have no knowledge.
@Lee_in_Iowa @POTUS is a threat to national security. He is illiterate, ignorant and insane. He must be impeached.
I will work tirelessly to see you defeated in PA! This is why Democrats will never control the senate again.
My 16 year is more savvy about cell phones & privacy than these turkeys. And attended public schools.
You're getting hysterical.Soon you'll call Trump a cannibal."The Trumpo ATE your baby!"Bob put your hair out.
agreed! What are you and your colleagues doing about it?
Trump is terrorizing US citizens with his cavalier disregard for our safety.
thank you for all your posts and continue to hold @realDonaldTrump accountable!
Says a defender of HRC's unsecured server in her bathroom
@Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump @pbump @washingtonpost maybe it's not a flashlight but camera transmitting info
@Leta_says @realDonaldTrump He was probably taking pictures of them to send to Boss Putin! If that weren't actually possible. 
@Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump if they were in a train car full of dynamite they would have struck a match!
8 more years? Try finishing up 4
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump @pbump ya think?!
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump yeah, but Emails/Benghazi/BenghaziEmails
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump some would call it reckless
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump But Hillary's G D. Emails! Ahhhhhh!
the pics of this are actually terrifying. does @realDonaldTrump take anything seriously? it doesn't look that way.
there should be an investigation & consequences for mishandling national security & confidential information!
Fake News- you're out in 2 years thank God
Excellent article and very concerning.  What the hell was he thinking? It's only a matter of time I guess.
impeach him, do something quick
You're a US senator. OF COURSE this is dangerous. THIS ADMIN IS DANGEROUS. DO SOMETHING.
& the FB post of the guests posing w/ the "nuclear football" carrier. Any rational GOP Senators? Just need 12
Guest posts on FB the name and photo of aide who carries nuclear football???
Ya think?
.@SenBobCasey @chickilopiccolo @realDonaldTrump Yeah, he should be more like  #flynn.  Maybe encrypt some calls?
We need fierce oversight and it is time to question how patriotic our GOP politicians are, not their motives.
@JCTheResistance @realDonaldTrump @pbump @washingtonpost Then do something. Tweets are not enough.
Time to rechristen POTUS SCROTUS -So-Called Ruler Of The United States #illegitimatePresident
no matter what he does it's gonna piss you off, Casey.
agreed.  Everything about @realDonaldTrump is dangerous #TrumpNotFitToServe
hahaha your candidate had nations secrets on unsecured server
This casual approach to security needs the solution trump's campaign offered. Lock him up!
You all need to get off the president's back. Dems & Liberals need to back off.
Democrats, like you, need to stop. Remember elections. Shameful to your father - a good man.
He's so casual because Russia's had our secrets for weeks.
@DavidYankovich @realDonaldTrump @pbump @washingtonpost that's the best you have? #impeachtrump
@DavidYankovich @realDonaldTrump You. Have. Voted. for. Every. Single. One. Of. His. nominees.
cmon Bob! There has to be something you can do bout this! This isn't an email! In public with cellphones? WTF
and you Sen. Casey supporting sanctuary cities and refugees isnt only extremely dangerous its also UN-AMERICAN
I guarantee if you don't get on board and start supporting POTUS and representing Pa voters,YOU WILL NEVER WIN ANOTHER ELECTION
Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to disAPPitchfork everybody you meet.
Senator Casey- who does the @SecretService answer to for this breach?
@DesertBeacon @realDonaldTrump Sir, SCROTUS is a disaster compromising our country's security. Help!
what are you going to do about it? We are in danger from Trump's ego and incompetence.
And the GOP is fine with it.  But Hillary's private server was disqualifying. Lying sacks of dirt
IDIOTS!!!  Every last one of them!!! #impeachTrumpnow
Considering the private server was such a big deal, not quite understanding why GOP is silent on this.
Impeachment must start immediately, we are so unsafe right now.
impeachment on what charge??? You're ridiculous!
