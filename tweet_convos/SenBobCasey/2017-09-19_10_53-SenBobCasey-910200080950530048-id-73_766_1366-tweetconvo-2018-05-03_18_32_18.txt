@SarahMMimms Why should GOP listen? U Dems didnt for past 8 yrs! OCare biggest joke ever! Listen to ALL Americans!
The GOP had control in both Houses for over seven years.  THIS IS A GOP PROBLEM.
In the House they did but not the Senate. Besides wat B O wanted Dems & illegals gave him.
The GOP controlled the senate by filibuster, abuse of the system to prevent anything at all useful.  THIS IS A GOP PROBLEM.
Oh I see! U mean like the Dems are holding up everything Trump/Gop doing now?! Got it!
Three republicans held up the Billionaire Wealthcare Act also known as the ACA Repeal bill.  You in Mother Russia that you don't know this?
Lolol! I wondered how long it would take u to pull ur lefty agenda..name calling.
Your righty agenda is to make excuses for politicians paid by billionaires to cut everything that doesnt directly put $$ in their pockets.
And nearly every professional healthcare organization is opposed because it harms their patients, families.
There is already an incredible shortage of healthcare workers. This abomination will drop the number of h.c. pros & students to crisis lvls.
Abomination!!
Only thing they're listening to right now is the 400m campaign $ they won't get w/out ACA repeal and tax cuts.
And in due time their Russian money will be gone too.
Fight them all the way. I love having you as my Senator. Thanks for looking out for us.
No they are not listening. GOP just wants to play a game of "Winning." People are no concern to them.
Are American Citizens lives worth more than $400,000million from Kochs, I guess we will find out soon, R's Soul is about to be REVEALED
Maybe you could take @SenToomey out for a beer & ask him why he wants millions of people to unnecessarily suffer & die. #GrahamCassidy
Senator Casey is a good man.  I've met him.  Toomey won't budge.  Sad.
Agree.  Sen Casey is great. 

Sadly, his counterpart doesn't seem to want to represent the views of the Commonwealth.
Add NJ
They don't care. They want to kill us all. I'm disheartened. 
I didn't beat cancer to fight this shit every day.
Too bad @GregAbbott_TX will not stand for Texans! He doesn't care enough to look into how Texas will lose $ and Texans will go bankrupt!
We need 2 @SenBobCasey and 0 @SenToomey 

I know, let's paint the Gen Assy blue in 2018 and pass a way to recall Asshat Pat!
Don't forget California!
Big Bucks!!!
No Whammys!!!
Nope. They are tone deaf, Senator.
NO. They are not listening. They are too busy hurrying to destroy healthcare, before Mueller opens up the can of worms.
@NicoJStarr @SenateGOP @SarahMMimms No, if they listened they'd never try to pass this crap bill which would hurt MILLIONS.
No they are not... In case you haven't noticed, they don't care
What is your stance @GovRickSnyder ?
Appreciate that you asked, sir, but the real question is does @SenateGOP *care*? (Spoiler: no, they do not.)
They stopped listening to the American people, years ago.
they are listening to their donors who are expecting return on their investments!
NO
Justice hasn’t received his marching orders?
I don't put a lot of stock in PA governor
Nope.  They're not.
Also Maryland (Hogan a Republican)
Because they all lose money in this. I'm not for any plan other than getting you idiots out of my health insurance/care issues.
Glad you think so @SenBobCasey , now add your support to the #MedicareForAll bill like the other Democratic senators!
Yeah!!
Cassidy's own Governor is opposed to the bill.
Is .@SenToomey listening to us? Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy!
Um . . . no?
It would helpful to know if these governors are GOP or Dem.  Shouldn't all the governors be against this bill?
Follow the link - some D, some R, and also an independent.
@SarahMMimms this bill takes away safeguards for pre-existings, lifetime caps, and penalizes women GOP not pro-life

A big shout out to my home states of Ohio & Pennsylvania! Listen to your governors!!!! @SenToomey @senrobportman #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
You know they aren't. They will put party over country, always. They lack integrity. They are cowards. #SaveACA #AffordabilityEqualsAccess
Trump is unfit to have nuclear codes and GOP is just plain unfit.@SenToomey @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @patmeehanpa
They don't care! Evil never sleeps!
I watching Schumer right now. This is nothing more than usual drama, playacting how vicious GOP is. This is like grade school.
Sending Healthcare back to the states is NOT going to reduce costs. Dr's need to work for LESS. Drugs Need to cost Less. @foxnews
I get the distinct impression they don't care.
Listen up GOP the people do not you to repeal ACA!! get to real work and effing fix it!! Or shut up
Hint: they're not.
They care not for the people; rather care about their own skins and pockets. Public service is unknown for most of the GOP.
Only FULL REPEAL will do. We ALREADY had the election & we the people voted to end wealth redistribution ObamaCare.  Do YOUR job for people

Are YOU listening Bob. #MedicareForAll
All liberal governors of course. Forgot to say that senator. #VoteCaseyOut #VoteYesOnGrahamCassidy
Our budget is bust and state credit rating is about to be downgraded. ARE YOU LISTENING???
We sure don't need anything that could work oh no. It's better to keep the one that's not working.
Sadly no. No they are not.
WTH? Where is Calif Where is Brown. We should be first to be aganst.
They only listen to the Sociopath @SenateMajLdr he is a racist murderer who has spent the last 8 months trying to erase Obama's existence!
Unfortunately Senator, they are not listening.  They are deaf to all the talk.  They don't care about what the People want. Only want $$$$
Medicare For All
Have you even look at that bill? Or just going with what's said
@GovRauner why don't you speak out against this for our state?It will cause our state a huge loss of $,not that we have any & many deaths.
They won't listen because money talks.
No, no...are you listening?  Why yes you are #WIRETAPPING
Do any of those ppl listed give big $$ to the GOPers?

If the answer is "no", then, no, they are not listening.
Anyone let Dean Heller know?
@SenateDems @SenSchumer Please do everything you can procedurally to stand in the way of this abominable bill.
Are you listening? Do your job and reduce the trillions of dollars of debt. Return your salary until you get this fixed.
If you give a damn about our people #VoteNOGrahamCassidy  if you vote yes, shame on you for letting your people down! This is inhumane
Thank you @SenBobCasey  and @GovernorTomWolf
Hey @SenateGOP: my life is more important than giving handouts to billionaires.
A lot of those handsouts are your representative also. Have you thought about that
Maybe you have better luck getting through to @SenToomey than his constituents....
Doubtful, but we can hope. @SenToomey only works for the Koch brothers, not his constituents. From PA-18, zip 15017.
Have they ever listened?

#SaveACA #ProtectOurCare #SinglePayer #MedicareForAll
Nope. Your PA colleague is "still reviewing" #GrahamCassidy. We know what he'll do. 
"Still reviewing" means @SenToomey is busy having his design department whip up some terrible infographics about it for him to tweet.
