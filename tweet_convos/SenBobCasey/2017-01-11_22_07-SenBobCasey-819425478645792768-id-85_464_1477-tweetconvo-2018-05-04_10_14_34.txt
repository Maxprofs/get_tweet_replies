Thank you, Mr. Casey. But why on earth did you vote against the @SenSanders amendment to conrol drug prices? We need you.
had a concern related to whether wholesalers would have to comply w/ safety provisions. Imp to ensure integrity of supply chain
Thanks for the quick reply! I hope you & Sanders can spearhead a way to add the safety provs. Big Pharma is not our friend.
#BigPharma may not be OUR friend. But it's definitely Senator Casey's. And Senators Bennet, Booker & Murray's. 
But Mr Casey, why did you vote no against the low drug price amendment?
The rest of Americans across the USA must suffer and die under OBAMACARE for 30 million! The 30 million already get it free!
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Dems continue to lie to American people
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP_ SenateGOP it is not enough to vote no.  Your leadership is required to oppose unethical govt
Sen Casey. Govt. is not the keeper of healthcare. Healthcare can be done by healthcare sharing organizations.
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP A 'no' vote is still a repeal going forward.  What can you and all the others voting no will do to stop
this train wreck from going forward?
you voted yes for all the losers. Do PA a favor and go away.
Thank you Sen Casey. I will lose my HC. I have history of cancer & chronic issues due 2car accident over a year ago
thank you!! And thank you to my representative, @RepBrady who I know will follow suit tomorrow.
what about your pharma vote?
Thank you so much, Sen Casey! Have #ACA coverage (not subsidized) allows my husband & I to work & contribute!

Thank you
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP I'll be proud to vote no when/if you come up for reelection #RepealAndReplace please
More bullshit Bob, " millions of PA " residents. Tell that fairy tale to someone who will believe it.
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Hope those PA voters are happy now that they lost all protections voting for that Orange Turd.

@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Thank you!
@bgmacneill @SenateGOP Thank you Sen Casey! @SenateGOP Now we know who the real death panel is. The GOP!

Of 11.5M ACA marketplace enrollees nationally, 6.3M live in Republican districts & 5.2M live in Democratic districts http://kaiserf.am/2iGMGPf  
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Thank you for your no vote, Senator. #resist. @SenateMajLdr
Thank you Senator Casey.
Great. You voted no. Now DO something effective. Shut it down. Force a full floor debate for each of the 600+ Trump nominees.
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP thank you!!
How is our other PA Senator Pat Toomey voting this evening?
yet you helped sell this program on the lies of saving $2500 a year in premiums & costs going down #liar
I wish you had more information on this. Health care coverage is such a rapidly changing expense we need to know
Thank You & god bless Senator Casey
thank you for your support! Young Americans NEED the #ACA!
Be more then proud. Be emphatic. Be persistent. Be unyielding. Health is not political.
thank you for fighting for those who need healthcare.  Keep up the good fight
cool. leave a system in place that has my parents (lifelong Pennsylvanians) paying higher premiums for less coverage.
they don't care.they only care about their own. Fuck everyone else, am I right Bob?
don't know if your watching but these asshat Dems are throwing fits while they are voting No.
