More hoaxes from your voters
Why oh why?
You need to do more than tweet about it.
please know acts of hate against anyone non white and Christian are happened everywhere. Anti Muslim anti LGBT anti black
how do we know they are hoaxes like the last umpteenth times? Stop spreading rumors and hysteria
@jaketapper @phillydotcom We have a lot of work to do
@jaketapper @phillydotcom u right @georgesoros should stop paying people to do it
and what about; KKK celebration parade in his honor http://nypost.com/2016/11/11/kkk-celebrating-trumps-election-with-victory-parade/ …
Today Trump denounced protests against him, but so far nothing denouncing the KKK celebration parade in his honor.@emmyrossum
it is in the schools too. And parents are making excuses https://m.facebook.com/councilrockparents/posts/1844854259079276 …
Agree. When will we hear from pres-elect @realDonaldTrump ?
yes by the Hillary supporter who wrote them wasn't anyone who wanted Trump.Deplorables aren't that way!.
guarantee that is a hoax from a Hillbot.  #MAGA
@jaketapper @phillydotcom obviously coming from the left. Why would a republican right that. Think we're stupid?
thank you senator for speaking out. We are all so scared. Please help us and congress
@lmichalch @phillydotcom ι'м мean wнaт can ι ѕay!!ιтѕ tru
It's actually not, gross hipster.
you know just as well as I do that this is being done by your nutty dems to blame on trump voters.  Predictable.
please ask President Obama to tell the anarchists to stand down. Stop the destruction.
@jaketapper Dems have to be doing this crap.  @realDonaldTrump supporters don't support such things
@jaketapper @phillydotcom Hispanic, Black, Muslim Kids in school are being bullied to get out of USA, thank you Trump.
It starts with jokes and graffiti and beeing discriminatory against woman and it ends with a dark nation or "white"
@KeystoneReport Did Bob Casey just get a gut check on Tuesday night? One of the most vulnerable Dems up next!
Now do this one:
finally Mr. Casey, something we can agree on
Where were the "white nationalist" poll watchers you were describing? Your vile rhetoric needs to be condemned.
amen
Are you condemning them or just asking others to do so? #AmericaFirst
why no condemnation of the violent anti President-elect protests? Is violence from the left ok with you?
@jaketapper @phillydotcom there's literally no way of knowing if these are fake, To make Trump and supporters look bad
the demagogue has allowed this level of hate 2b acceptable. My vote was not heard. Repeal electoral college #hesnotmypresident
@jaketapper They must be laughed at, then ignored.  MSM's "condemnation" best way of helping these groups advance. Idiots.
@jaketapper Disgusting bias like this makes me so happy Trump neutered the MSM. #ProHillaryRiots
agreed.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom Once a protest becomes violent, or vandalism, LAW ENFORCEMENT should bring order by all means needed.
How do you feel about 11yr.old beaten,now on crutches for voting Trump in mock election w/EVIDENCE which no HOAXES have?
I agree, tell your South Philly supporters to stop vandalizing
Prob the same ones that did this
You people should not be allowed to share stories without proof to incite more violence against Trump supporters whichhas proof
She misspelled P.I.M.P.
I'm with you @SenBobCasey
If this upsets you, then tell all these progressive liberals to stop the vandalism & protesting & rioting. #MAGA
@jaketapper @phillydotcom considering events of last few days, I assume it was a product of anti-Trump crowd. Esp the swastika.
looks like someone realized he is up for re-election in 2-yrs & PA is no longer a safe blue state
@jaketapper Trump has emboldened those people who promote hate and fear.
closed circuit TV caught black guy doing it
Lol..c'mon! U rly think Trump supporters did that? Far more likely it's the ones out rioting. Stop w/ propaganda
@jaketapper @phillydotcom Like these ones. Trump has to clean the mess he created.
These are members of your own party, comrade. The Democrat cockroaches swarming out from behind the baseboards #TrumpRiot
@jaketapper @phillydotcom Paid protestor r doing this.
@MrJoshCharles @phillydotcom So far silence from the president elect.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom
Senator, the American people are relying on you & your colleagues to make sure public servants of both parties do just that
Guaranteed that was sprayed by a hillary supporter! Get your facts straight crooked media! #CNNsucks
@jaketapper @phillydotcom

You are my Senator
Be careful!

NOTHING like your Father!
Quit the Trump is a Racist Game !!!
is there a large German population in south philly?
@MrJoshCharles @phillydotcom they better be, Philly.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom 

I pray for President-elect Trump.

The Dems and Media will get him assassinated
Thank you Mr. Casey! Let's work together to heal our fractured nation. #VeteransDay
: If the Democrats allowed you to run for President as the pro-life Democrat that you are, you would have trounced Trump.
There goes the neighborhood.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom 
By the acts of men freedom will ring or die this day upon whom serves office. By their acts.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom I hope we still have law and order in the country
Would you guys think that a "Stop Obama's Communism" graffiti was put up by Obama's supporters?
@jaketapper @phillydotcom Was the Senator referring to Trump's acts of hate?
@jaketapper How about calling on @realDonaldTrump to denounce this?
@jaketapper @phillydotcom MAYBE a well regulated militia is called for? 
@jaketapper @phillydotcom no doubt, but hv U seen the anti-trump, anti white lefties beating motorists, writing racial graffiti
@jaketapper @phillydotcom so must these...CNN doesn't  show this. It doesn't fit their "agenda"
WATCH: Chicago Democrat Thugs Beat up Trump Supporter ‘You Voted Trump. You’re Gonna Pay for That Sh*t.’ http://heat.st/2g1pLka  @heatstreet
It won't be Trump's ppl condemning it. They inspire it.
yes but it is very obvious that a lot of people in PA are racist good luck with keeping peace
@jaketapper @phillydotcom One would think this is from HRC supporter who believes Trump is Hitler. What does Casey think?
what did you expect? Wake up.
@girl_writing  I agree I don't know why and don't think they do and it's sad if this is what we must expect
@jaketapper @phillydotcom I agree senator but this is the hate Donald Trump stoked to win. He is partially to blame !
Wht are they protesting?Democracy?Voting?Do the even know?Want a do-over?A new political demographic,the uneducated HRC votr?
What are you going to do to stop them from destroying our cities?
Unfortunately Trump set a strong precedent, and has to expect a response.
but yet Trump remains silent.  He started and now must condemn it.
I agree, but that would mean OWNING it...doubt that will happen.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom This is not what our nation is about and will set us back rather than move us forward.
Have you re-tweeted condemnation of those.. If so thank you if not ..WHY NOT
I don't hate Trump, but I believe I have a duty to call him what he is--what he has announced from his own mouth.
Jake you might mention the possibilities.. Since there are opposition ppl calling for assassination attempts
@jaketapper @phillydotcom
Well, GOP can thank DRUMPF for this
He has given permission & encouraged
Bigoted rhetoric 
BELIEVE ME
…I honestly can't tell if this is pro or anti Trump? Does it mean, "I like Trump and I'm a Nazi," or "Trump is a Nazi?"
it's anti Trump.
For too long people hesitated to announce what Trump really is: small-minded racist and misogynist.
@jaketapper @phillydotcom this is the hate that's an extension of the Hillary Clinton's campaign
@jaketapper @phillydotcom it's wrong , trump's fault. He started the hate.
If this is a Trump supporter there is no room on the planet for this crap ... If this is Opposition its ever worse
@jaketapper @phillydotcom scariest aspect about this is that it's hard to decipher if it's proud supporter's or angry anti's
This is what the ppl want, they elected a racist President who thinks it's OK, what did you expect would happen
@jaketapper @phillydotcom Should be condemned by Obama/Clinton.
Why--because these words speak truth to power that Trump is a racist and a fear-monger?
@jaketapper such obvious false flags
The party of peace isn't very peaceful
