uh huh. Already emailed & called to support Ms DeVos. I say this is a Lib attack on woman!
NOT a lib attack! I have 2 be highly qualified to teach. She's NOT HQ to lead
BTW HQ, stands for headquarters
may I ask your profession?
Engineer in Heavy construction & BS in political Sci & I/O psychology.
then would it be appropriate to assume that you oversee considerable sized construction projects?
$65 million was my largest.
the same for my field? Lack of knowledge and expertise can lead to incredible downfall. Not just my students but all students
Talk to Toomey about representing the wishes of PA voters.
I read a Cong. staffer said email is next most effective after calls. http://toomey.senate.gov/?p=contact 
We have been calling, emailing, letter writing and faxing. Toomey has been hiding. Staffers are overwhelmed to the point of inertia.
@SenToomey well then I look forward to your relieving him of his duties next time
In 6 years, sadly.
here's hoping the republic is still standing thenB
Can you talk to @SenToomey ? Will he talk to you?We can never reach him. He always ignores his constituents. Thanks.
@KathleenHeuer @SenBobCasey @SenToomey  Send him a pizza with a note.
Hmm, he's very proud that he got the "coveted" candy desk. Maybe I'll send him candy from Philly. Thanks!
@DebraMessing @SenateDems @SenateGOP Vote for Devos is vote to end your term. The resistance is real!
@shredderfeeder @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos thank @SenatorReid for giving us the #NuclearOption -VP will vote her in
Doesn't make @BetsyDeVos any less an idiot, and since she's refused to divest we'll keep her busy in court-limit the damage.
you lost pal. All you're doing it making kids lives harder.
is anti-education, she doesn't know the first fucking thing about the job. I have kids, she's a threat to them.
Casey Election is coming, confirm or be cast out. tired f leaders acting like toddlers
Thank you, Senator Casey! Now if you can get @SenToomey to answer his phones, THX
please help us! She is not qualified. This is a mockery to educators.

So everyone can be as ignorant as you?

It isn't a contest little boy.

We tried but cowardly @SenateGOP members unplugged their VM. We're furious! We won't forget how they ignored voters
I oppose Casey and will not be voting for him again in 2018!
@wtf_imtooold @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos is ABSOLUTELY NOT fit to manage education
Just called Toomeys office. DeVos is completely unqualified.
I have called or Faxed @SenToomey every day for 2 weeks. He's not hearing our message @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos
Thank you, @SenBobCasey &  @SenateDems for putting our children's future ahead of $!!  Keep up the good fight!
who is the Republican most likely to change their vote?
too bad losers she is now Secretary of education
@thepoliticalcat @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos Us there a limit to the number of Filibusters? Why are you not doing so?
Made the call. Stay strong!
Thank you! Keep up the fight. Children deserve much better than this @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos
We the people oppose DeVos b/c she is one of the most unqualified nominees for this post EVR
No we don't oppose Betsy DeVos. Anyone obstructing is a whack job.
@PrescottTwinz @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos 

Sen Casey how can the ppl fight our bribed Senators like @SenToddYoung?
@SenToddYoung The majority of your IN constituents don't want DeVos. Why do you? Vote NO!
@Dr_of_Nursing @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos Sadly, GOP'ers ignoring overwhelming pushback by their constituents
.@KMForeman1 @SenBobCasey @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos constituents will have their revenge at the voting booth.
Betsy Devos is the most unqualified candidate in history and apparently most other subjects.
@DebraMessing @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos please don't confirm her we need someone who knows what their doing
Keep up the working for yourselves, the country is fed up with do nothing congress
Actually no, no we do not oppose her. In fact we support her.
Done
I told @RoyBlunt already - despite many, many calls - he's with DeVo$.
NCThom Tillis's office says he's undecided and wants to hear from people (202) 224-6342 I just called. EVERYONE SHOULD. NOW
Done everything we could think of-perhaps propose a gr8 replacement you can support-the GOP must realize another better suited!
Have been voicing NO on DeVos! GOP needs 2 say nay! The Amer public DOES NOT want her!
@DebraMessing @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos Republicans should stop selling our country out! #Shame
@DebraMessing @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos Where was this #weneednine when Obama was in office? Pure Hypocrisy!!! #SHAME
we are with you. DeVos is unqualified and unworthy. She bought her way with $200mm to GOP!
@DebraMessing @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos Does it really matter what we say? #NottheElite
@DavidYankovich @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos making calls. My senator, @SenDonnelly on board.
it would be awesome if I thought the GOP gave a damn about anyone but their donors.
@DavidYankovich @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos what time (eastern) is the vote?
u were wrong about the Pats, but I'll still support u tomorrow. NO on #devos
BUT I DO NOT OPPOSE HER. So no way. Let Trump have his picks.
By the way Cruz & Cornyn, we know we only need ONE more vote. Man up!
In TX teachers tend to be republican. Attact public education and they will flip.
@juuuraaa27 @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos I have been trying for days. Could only leave a message at local offices.
I have contacted my own senators including @SenToomey  and senators from other states #NotoDeVos VOTE NO
She is very well spoken as a privileged person apt to be,  But she says nothing.
I oppose @BetsyDeVos for Secretary of Education - she is not qualified it it sure smells like #Pay2Play
Back to real 
WE have and WE will!
@indivisibletx03 @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos  do not vote her in! She's AWFUL for Education!!
#NoDevos Man up @senmarcorubio #DoTheRightThing oh yeah she paid you off #RuinPublicEduc
educators do not want DeVos. She is not qualified.
@elissayancey @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos unfortunately I'm "represented" by Jeff Flake
.@SenBobCasey it'd be great if @SenToomey would answer his phones... or at least check messages. He's been missing [aka hiding]. @SenateGOP
I am #realPA and I absolutely oppose DeVos.  Do the right thing.
@b @lionessmom76 Weâ€™re with you Bob! Keep fighting!
@District15Ohio @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BetsyDeVos @senrobportman is doing everything he can to ignore his constituents.
Many of us don't care whether Sec. Ed. is Dem or GOP, but s/he MUST BE AN EDUCATOR. @BetsyDeVos IS NOT!
is THE LEAST-qualified nominee Trump put forward. If you confirm her, WE'RE VOTING YOU OUT!
To you in @SenateGOP who took $ from @BetsyDeVos + her fam., if you vote FOR her, you're saying U.S. is for SALE!
, You owe U.S. kids a quality public education. If you vote for @BetsyDeVos, YOU'RE sabotaging education.
