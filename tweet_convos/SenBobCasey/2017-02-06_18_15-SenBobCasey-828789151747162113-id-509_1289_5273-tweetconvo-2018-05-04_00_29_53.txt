@bullwinklecat1 I can't believe any sane person is voting for Betsy Devos to run a dept. dedicated to education of the future.
and how has the DoED done so far without this woman??? US has worst education in world
It does not have worse education in the world  However, states keep slashing education $$
They call it "fiscally responsibility." But totally insensitive to 4 billion military hardware 1/
the problem is the truth is helping the poor puts more $$ into economy than that form of taxation
.@bullwinklecat1 @therealPhiz @Mike30362293 @SenBobCasey 
That expensive military hardware is often destroyed after use.
(See: Yemen raid)
The minds of Conservatives and Republicans in general are apparently impervious 1/
to reasoning. You can't make incoherent arguments for a principle you claim to love.
Thank u Senator Casey for giving us, your constituents, a voice. I'm grateful. @SenToomey Could learn a thing or two from you.
That suggests that @SenToomey is capable of learning. Or cares what his constituents think.
Duly noted. All I can say is this particular voter won't forget this. Not today or in the next 6 yrs.
Nor will this one.
Thank you for your efforts to oppose DeVos.
thank you g or trying
@SenateDems u didn't do very well. Handover ur paychk education in USA ranked 28 in world blow it up
thanks for your hard work Senator Casey. Keep fighting the good fight. PA appreciates you.
thankfully you were unsuccessful.  Represent you constituants, we are watching & will remember when you are up for reelection
Great job holding the floor. You do us proud!
@SenateDems public education now in jeopardy. Administration takes down data on USDA website on puppy inspection
thank you for standing up for our kids.  What a nightmare.
thank you for taking a stand on this. I will remember at the next election.  #realpa #pavoter #ResistTrump #wedeservebetter
thanks for your hard work.

glad she was confirmed
Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to the PA voters. I'll remember you in 2018 and VOTE YES for Casey!!
Thank you for looking out for us. I feel better knowing we have you.
@SenateDems Sen Warren silenced by Sen McConnell outrageous
@SenThomTillis just sold us out. Horrible man... will leave his legacy as the dumbing down of education in America.
thank you for all you have done in this fight
thank you for all you do.   Your constituents notice that you are with us! #Casey2018

Thank you for your vote! Next?!
Thank you for being a champion for education!
Get 'em, Bob! We got your back!

how about the "Maverick" @SenJohnMcCain? Remind him how Trump called him a loser for getting captured!
Thanks for all you do for the citizens of PA...and the USA!
You have my contempt....
need to get @senrobportman to #VoteNoDevos and represent #ohio better #educationmatters
Am I correct in my assumption that you have tried to convince @SenToomey  and failed?
thank you for doing this for PA and listening
how about real ethics and get 46 dems to vote yes.  Dem's turned public schools into public baby sitters teach to test only
@SenateDems u will lose ur job soon
Much appreciated. Too bad our other senator won't be joining you. Pat Toomey should vote "NO."
THANK YOU SO MUCH. You have no idea what this means to ordinary Americans. I feel like you have my back. Have a great day!
@Kelly_Amber redemption PA!!!!
liberal freaks!!
Thank you, Senator. I've called both my senators. They won't be changing their minds, so I'm glad you're fighting for my kids.
thank you, Senator Casey!!!!
Thank u kindly Mr.Casey
Thank you. Too many Rs got campaign contributions from #DeVos family and should be exposed.
Thank you and your colleagues (and staff!) for your  support!
thank you for YOUR support.
Yes! Thanks!
If you see @SenToomey, tell him PA has been looking for him, and we'd like him to vote no, and he should check his voicemail.
I wish @SenToomey would listen to his constituents. Thank you for looking out for PA and our kid's education!
Thank you for your hard work. Keep it up!
@heathermackey Thank you.
Funny Bob, you work so hard on the negative,  and nothing on the positive.
thank you, Senator! 
keep up the good work!
@SenateDems thank you please talk to Toomey.  Enough money raised to support his replacement next election if he approves her
Can Sharia be practiced freely in the US?

@SenateDems Thank you for standing up for us!
