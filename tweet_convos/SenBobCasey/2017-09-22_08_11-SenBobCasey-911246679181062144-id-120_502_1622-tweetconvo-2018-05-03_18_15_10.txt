I implore @SenBobCasey and @SenToomey to reject #GrahamCassidy, which jeopardizes the wellbeing of the 12 million Pennsylvanians we serve. 
Thank you Senator for not signing onto a death warrant for millions of Americans! Please help force a debate! This Bill will Kill
Thank you
Thank you, Senator Casey, for protecting the people of Pennsylvania.
He's helping Medicaid.middle class are paying out big premiums, one pa family is paying $1100 mo. prem. w/$12,000 ded. Paying $25,200/yr
Hazzah, a stranger is arguing with me on the Interwebs! Behold as all my deeply held convictions melt away in the blazing heat of his tweet.
Thank you, @SenBobCasey for doing what is right for your constituents!!
Thank you @GovernorTomWolf for your outrage - unfortunately that stooge @SenToomey is firmly in the @GOP pocket and puts party over PA!
.@SenToomey keeps showing that he doesn't care about any of us. He's totally in @GOP pocket & only cares about money, not Lives. #shameonyou
Profoundly said, but they are all in it for the ¢$$$$$$$, wasn't for lobbyists Senators haft to go to work, make honest living!!!!
Please let @SenToomey know how important it is to reject this bill. I’ve called his office several times and  it’s just falling on deaf ears
We can call all day long and he doesn't care he cares about the tax cuts for the rich only.
No surprise, you have been saying no to working class for years. I glad your up for re-election next year
Thank you @SenBobCasey & @GovernorTomWolf for caring about PA's healthcare. If only @SenToomey cared about his constituents' well-being too.
Thank you Senator Casey!
I always vote for you as many do... we deserve an response from you
Thanks Gov for showing the concern!
I am just lucky Sen. McCain has also vowed to not vote in support for the Cassidy-Graham bill, Gov. Wolf no worries, we  win the oligarchs!
Vote NO please
Thank you!
Thank you Sen. CASEY!
Thank you Sen Casey for standing up for the people of PA .. if only Sen Pat 1.43% Toomey will do his part now
Still waiting to hear why you don't support single payer @SenBobCasey - you're on the list of ppl taking money from insurance companies
Pls President Trump, let Obamacare fall on its face!!!!
We Pennsylvanians have begged and pleaded with Toomey, but all he sees is $$$$$. He only hears his corporate supporters , not the people.
I live in Pa & I say Thank You!
Ad s disabled person on Medicaid taking care of a disabled child on Medicaid, Thank you.
Thanks to you & @GovernorTomWolf you make me feel a little safer in Pa. It feels good knowing you are looking out for us. 
Thank you and thank you @GovernorTomWolf  hopefully, @SenToomey will get the message of what the people in this state want! #GrahamCassidy
Washington D.C. should not be involved in Pennsylvanian's individual health care insurance!
obamacare which YOU voted for puts Pennsylvanian's individual health care insurance at risk.
Proud Pennsylvanian right here. Thank you, @SenBobCasey & @GovernorTomWolf. @SenToomey, I assume, is back in his undisclosed location.
Thank you @SenBobCasey
@GovernorTomWolf  you can forget @SenToomey.  He's so far up Trumps butt we may never see him again.
WHY do millionaires like you have health care subsidized by the taxpayer who is already stretched thin from obamacare, which YOU voted for!
We know u will vote no however pat toomey will never look out for his constituents
Thank you Senator Casey!! Keep up the fight!
Glad to see you don't care about the ones paying your salary.
So what's yours,& @GovernorTomWolf  plan for the massive inc in premiums here in PA. Are u going to put all of us on Medicaid?
So glad that #SenJohnMcCain believes bi-partisan is the way to go on this.  Keep at it Sen. Casey!
Toomey's a dork. Bob Casey for President.
Doing something in a bipartisan way would at least turn the country in a direction to think about healing.
Thank you.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for your #leadership on this #ProtectOurCare
So where's Traitor Toomey stand? @SenToomey @RecallPatToomey #CassidyGrahamBill #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #Pennsylvania
@GovernorTomWolf @SenToomey Oh! And ANYONE running against you Tom Wolf!
@GovernorTomWolf @SenToomey Yes Bob. Just as I will emphatically vote for LOU!! R u ok with that Pat Toomey? 
Somebody is gonna start plucking these fools off one by one and i'm gonna sit back and enjoy it
Ya'll going over to Kimmel's house for a tickle fight later?
Toomey will not vote No! He is bought and sold by trump.
Thank you!
Heard @SenToomey hedging on a news interview last evening re ACA repeal. Not hard to guess how he'll vote. #IndependentVoiceHA
Thank you! See if you can get @SenToomey  to do the right thing.
Sadly, it's very clear @SenToomey doesn't do what is best for the citizens of Pennsylvania. Thank you @SenBobCasey for putting us first!
Yes the Gov would actually have to do something with health care .
Thank you!!!
@GovernorTomWolf Anyone who believes @SenToomey has a conscience is sadly mistaken. He cares only for himself and his donors. His vote: yes
Oh what a surprise 2 limp dick legislators agree  ..... awesome to see you too taking risks and bucking the establishment..... not!
So your saying you can't do a better job than the disfunc US gov if you are put in charge of your state health care?
Thank you, Senator Casey, for opposing this harmful legislation.  Thank you for standing up for your constituents and all Americans.
Thank you, @SenBobCasey!
Thank you!!!
Thank you for standing up for us and doing the right thing!  If only @SenToomey could find his spine and do the same.
I'm sure the rubber stamp Republican counterpart of yours won't be reading that.
Thank you, @GovernorTomWolf, for acting in the best interest of your constituents!
Is this becuz PA isn’t capable of handling healthcare if it’s left to the state? You’re likely right cuz OA govt not doing too well.
Thank you Senator for protecting the American people
Thank you @SenBobCasey !
@SenToomey please vote with PA, not simply your GOP
Thank you, Senator. I just saw an analysis showing that just over a million people in PA alone would lose coverage.
Thank you
You're lying just like the rest of your party this bill puts control back to the states obamacare sucks
What does this bill have to do with "illegal invaders"?
It was a simple question. I am sorry that you are unable to answer.
Hey Bob, this whole year you voted NO. You belong to the party of NO. And you will vote NO the rest of the year. Where's the big surprise
I'll be disappointed if your saying "no" on the floor is not objectively emphatic!
Please let us know why you haven't signed onto #MedicareForAll Mr. Senator.
Matty thanks you!!!! #Trisomy8Mosaicism #Medicaid #VoteNo
Thank you!!
Thank you, Senator Casey! 

@SenToomey, please vote NO #GrahamCassidyBill
THANK YOU SENATOR CASEY. Please talk some sense into Toomey.
Thank you!
.@SenToomey  ohhhhhhTooooooomey!
Thank you, Senator Casey! For speaking on behalf of this who will suffer from this bill. #votenotograhamcassidy
Thank you for doing the right thing.  @SenToomey you're an ass.  Period.  #2points!!  We won't forget!  #Fetterman2022 @JohnFetterman
Thank you to you and your governor for speaking up.
Thx you sir!
Thank you senator Casey!!
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you sir.
What about the ppl who are tired of having a choice between expensive health coverage or a penalty? Screw then right
Why don't you help fix Obamacare? It is not working and you don't care.
He tried. They were working toward a bipartisan solution but the GOP threw that out in favor of Graham-Cassidy.
Thank you for all your hard work!
Too bad Sen. Toomey doesn't have the same moral standards as you!
THANK YOU @SenBobCasey 
America  Will Not Forget!
Thank you, @SenBobCasey, for your vote and your activism. And, thanks as always to @GovernorTomWolf for his policy and work as gov! #PAlove
imagine two dem hacks think alike, both are losers that will be voted out soon, thank God
Thank you sir for having our best interests and health in mind.  I applaud you Sir 
Thank you for caring about the people of PA, Senator! Now, if you could give a nudge to @SenToomey, that would great!
Thank you for putting constituents first.
Thank you, Senator!!!
Thank you @SenBobCasey for voting no on this awful bill. Your voice is much appreciated! I only wish @SenToomey would care as much & vote no
You'll do whatever your party tells you to do. Always have, Always will. #DraintheSwamp & #MAGA. @USTermLimits needed now!
Read the bill!!! There is a reason people are against it... and the same could be said for Republicans who want to kill everyone off.
Thank you for not supporting #GrahamCassidyDeathBill & genocide of constituents. Who wouldve thought such a decision would require courage?!
@SenToomey does not serve the citizens of PA.  He serves the Koch brothers & other wealthy donors.
Thank you!
Thank you from Texas Senator Casey. My Senators @SenTedCruz & @JohnCornyn don't care about Texans. They are intentionally trying to hurt us
We can be sold for a price..this time its Koch money. Is that any surprise coming from a former slave state? Nothing has changed.
Thank you, Senator!
As usual, you put your Master Schumer & corrupt party ideals above your constituents. We'll remember this in 2018, and #VoteCaseyOut!!
Did you read Graham-Cassidy and see how it will impact everyone??
Meanwhile @senToomey 's voicemail is full.
Thank you for protecting us and our children!
Can you tell @SenToomey to do the same?
Thank you Senator. Any advice on how to reach @SenToomey?
Thank you for standing firmly against #GrahamCassidy, Senator. Your constituents appreciate your advocacy!
