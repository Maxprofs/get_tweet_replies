Thanks loads GOP.I've effectively lost my insurance. GOP did this to Americans Never forget the GOP
you lost your insurance because of you.
I think your old enough to figure out, nothing is free in life. Your burden is not my burden to carry.
They're hurting real people, fellow Americans. Have they no compassion or empathy? Jesus.
Where do you come off as they? American tax dollars pay for this.
soon your taxes will pay for a wall.
Chump change! And pretty soon, you'll be neighbors with a bunch of entitled liberals from America.
You better pray hard every night that you never end up with a debilitating disease/disability. Then you'll know how it feels.
why? I have insurance and it's pretty good.
Keep saying that, until you get a chronic disease and they drop you/won't pay for "reasons"
Your pretty paranoid for someone who lives in Canada.
Dems should refuse all SCOTUS nominees until Trump releases his Taxes.
he doesn't have too.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Congress must tie themselves to same program as ppl. Anything less is hypocritical.
should of told the exempt Obama that.
To be expected but will generate protests in every state!
@Honey17011 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP GOP only does what helps themselves!  They could care less about the American ppl!
can you post a link to the legislation for everyone to read?
should be up on http://thomas.gov  tomorrow, is approximately 1-3 pages in length. very straightforward
John I have not seen it yet. Would you happen to have the link to it?
I think I found it. I didn't see any FDA provision in there, which Sen Sanders's office said was in there?
Which way did Toomey vote do you know?
The way you think. Tried calling Toomey's office but mailbox was full. Good job fellow citizens. Let's keep it up.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP You expect us to belive that Donald Trump LIED about something!? #Shocked
they can't even pretend to care. So eager to save taxes 4 themselves and 1%#ACA
Thank you for continuing to fight for the over 100M Americans with preexisting conditions.
@BarbB0925 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Donald lies...don't you realize that by now?
My sharp @SenBobCasey forced @SenateGOP to explicitly reject his amendment to protect ppl w/ pre-existing conditions. Stick it to them Bob!
.@realDonaldTrump says he supports protections for those w/ preexisting conditions yet @SenateGOP voted against my amendment to do just that
Thanks @SenBobCasey, a real voice for the people of PA & the nation. Standing up against the callous @SenateGOP in fight to save the #ACA.
on final #ACA budget vote @SenateGOP is trying to gavel us down. The voices of millions of PA residents will not be silenced
an alternative- flat tax, abolish the IRS, savings to expand Medicare for the poor and uninsurable
I project often.
and DT are full of shit and don't give a fuck about the people. Only care about $ & re-election
@AkaMsCrowley @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP and one is  shocked?
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP I've seen kids with cancer booted when ins ran out. What would he do 4 his own child?
PROTECT THOSE W/PREEXISTING CONDITIONS! #cancer #diabetes #children #elderly #PREEXISTING #promises
@chickilopiccolo @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Trump is a LIAR
I've lost respect for so many Republicans
Is he learning that he's not really the dictator, and not everyone will obey?
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Also against wishes of vast majority of Americans.
trump lies. You know that.
well clearly they have no respect for @realDonaldTrump and think he is a joke.
Thank you @SenBobCasey - please keep fighting! Don't let @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP take away something that has helped so many ppl!
as a PA constituent with a 5 yr old with a big heart condition, I beg you to keep preexisting conditions in there.
Don't tell me that surprises you?
I'd like to see our politicians live with the fear of being sick without insurance.They're clueless
I'm sorry, Senator Casey. Thank you for trying to protect your constituents.
keep fighting for us Senator Casey! We have your back if you have ours! #aca
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Proud Senator Casey is my Senator!
Yes I know. :( That's why we have to support Casey even more thru 2018!
Wish you were my Senator. Thanks for fighting for us in PA! Much appreciate!
wont GOP need 60 votes to change the programs basic tenets?
Any Senate Democrat who votes to confirm Sessions as AG should be expelled from the Democratic Party. No exceptions.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Well I truly hope Trump supporters who were using ACA have a back up plan
@USNavyMomPA @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP I'm at a loss. I don't know how to help.
Either Trump or GOP have been lying. He thinks his base will accept anything- but not about health.
.@SenBobCasey @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP ...proof positive that Drumpf is a pathological liar.
- thanks for supporting Americans
 @SenateGOP and @SenToomey - you should be ashamed of supporting TRUMP!
#TheResistance
@DrJenGunter @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Time for everyone who this law has helped or literally saved to call their reps.
They are either CLUELESS as to the terrible impact of this or don't care. SHAME
This disparity adds to the tension & anxiety caused by the prospect of what's to come. CHAOS reigns
@randyprine @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP We are Doomed.  Thanks GOP 
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP are you surprised? They don't give two hoots about providing decent healthcare coverage.
@PricklyPam @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP REFUCLICUNTS
Thank you Senator Casey for your efforts.
@nancymoskowitz  @GOP have their own agenda &don't care about their constituents at all.Thanks Sen.Casey 4 efforts
Trump will fix the disaster you & Obama have created. Go play with Schumer & Pelosi
Keep working to get this right! $32K+ for medical in 2015 for hard working people NOT affordable
Employed Son loses ACA? Epilepsy med becomes $2000 a month. Can't afford. Goes on disability. #Shortsided #Cruel
Middle of the night. They're making decisions to benefit businesses & wealthy. Not avg Americans.
@scue @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP They lie on top of lies with more lies thrown in! YOU pay my medical bills. Morons!!
So it appears we have a quasi-puppet President the @SenateGOP will summarily ignore!
Because they're evil, greedy people who care for no one.
@TheDemCoalition Sen R Portman Sen R Johnson Sen P Toomey Sen Burr Sen Blunt all would've been replaced & now watch the damage
@JamboSchlarmbo @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP follow the money. Repubs aren't the party for and of the people.  They're selfish.
@USseriously @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP that's because Trumpers are idiots!
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Of course, they think $800 to $1000 dollars a month for high risk pools is workable.
@LeaBlackMiami @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP
My heart just dropped. It's time to lead not obstruct/destroy.
What else was in that amendment, Senator?

is a pathological liar, too. @SenateGOP
@lightheart1 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP So killing babies w cancer OK with GOP
@jeffstrabone @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP This feels like we r watching a slo-mo car crash & we can't do anything to change it.
.@SenBobCasey @akabeth10 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Thank you for your amendment. They are killing many of us off. Literally. Replacement?
@TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP They are evil little trolls
my son has T1D. Just Let him die? W/o insurance just insulin is $917/mo.
I'm very sorry to hear that abt your son I pray everything will be ok w/him
That's because they are hypocritical.  The would rather lye than tell the truth NO SELFRESPECT WOW
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP 
The GOP lyes about everything. That is how they won the election. Gullible constituency
@grigs @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Trump lies. Get that through your naive skull!
@Lawrence No surprise.  GOP never cared abt hlthcare. 2000-2006 did nothing. They are & care only abt rich ppl, don't need it.
If you didn't know this by now you haven't been paying attention GOP:  bought and paid for by rich.
This is outrageous! Does GOP realize there will be blood and lives on their hands? Disgraceful!
I've got Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and a primary immunodeficiency - I already had to choose groceries > treatment, even with ACA
I'm terrified of what's going to happen to me & others like me now. We need your strength in this fight.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Senator thank you!
Senator I'm CA b7t will die if pre-existing condition not upheld so I thank YOU for helping PA ill
bastards everyone
@DeeVirgo914 @SenateGOP Mother of 3, small business owner & breast cancer survivor. TY Rs 4 putting me & my family at risk.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP It's ansoktely criminal!
Keep up the good fight, Bob! Gotta resist giving our country to grubs eating the roots.
49 Senators who voted Nae are all on my sh!t list:
http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00015 â€¦
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP It's Trumpcare now! Make America sick again!
Trump is too busy to care, and they have zero accountability.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Be honest don't get our hopes up that we will keep our coverage!
Many Americans will suffer if this occurs.
Thank you for standing up for the people of PA.
this news disturbs me. My congressman also is against healthcare for preexisting conditions
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP That was why ACA was created, can't work w/o mandate. Lying to us!
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP GOP cares for nothing and no one but their own power. Will be our downfall.
If they do #RepealAndReplace, the Dems should run in 2018 on #RestoreAndImprove
Awesome idea, Yonside!
Thanks. @SenBobCasey gets that one for free. But he should put me on his staff 
 I agree 100% @YonsideNews! 
I love @SenBobCasey & think he'd consider giving you a shot! In the meantime, keep those Great ideas coming!
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP  That is a total lie NO WAY will Ins. Co. agree to cover preexisting
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP   Thank you Sen Casey. @SenToomey  betrayed PA 's hard working class tonight. @WPXI
Here's a hint: every single thing Trump says is a lie. Other than his slavish devotion to Putin.
everything he says about others is true. He sees it in the shiny 1/
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP A lot of you Trump supporters are getting the green wieny. GOP doesn't care about you!
So he lied when he gave the interview to 60 min days after the election. #FlipFlops
yes he lied about everything the wall, Putin & David Duke
Plus Melania's immigration papers.
I have an autoimmune disorder & heart arrhythmia. My hubby has a-fib. So we just die? #deathpanels
I'm 36, hubby 37, we have 3 children
What? GOP again doing harm. & what's up with this legislation about hiding costs?
@UnityDefeatsAll @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP What are the Repubs doing?!  This is tantamount to a death sentence for Americans
We will fight to remove pre-existing cond. cov from Congress' LIFETIME ins.  You want it; you pay.  No tax $$ for it
Don't look now but the BUTCHERS are in charge = SAD !
WTH? - why would they do that?? - just shows again the true colors of 'Pro-Life' Republicans.
I saw we are watching on @CSPAN thank you for fighting to save #ACA #Obamacare
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Now who didn't see this type of thing coming months ago?
literal answer: #maga
It must be your amendment that's the problem.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Then go at it again
funny how that works eh?
What else was in the Amendment Bob ? #Pork ?
Why do they hate us so much?
They don't recognize our existence enough to hate us.
