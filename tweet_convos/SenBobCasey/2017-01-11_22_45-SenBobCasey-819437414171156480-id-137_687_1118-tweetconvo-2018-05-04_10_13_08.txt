I would like to see more of you follow the example of Rep John Lewis and refuse to attend the inauguration. #NotMyPresidentElect
we won you lost.  btw...we don't care what you Democrats say.  Enjoy Trump for the next 8 years. LOL
tell DNC we want them to stop taking money from BIG PHARM so R meds R affordable
@SenateGOP Negative, those that voted no simply votes to TAX Americans more with higher premiums and deductibles.  Nothing more
What about this !!!
Make us the people sick !!
Drain the swamp corrupt politician
when you vote against making drugs cheaper for Americans, then some Dem Senators (13) already want America to be sick again.
Those of you that VOTED NO on the SANDERS-KLOBUCHAR Amendment to allow Canadian Drugs to be Imported to the US.SHOULD BE ASHAMED
u plp r sick puppies.. Ur BarryBHO screwed my country I fought for! @realDonaldTrump called u clowns, I call u schmucks! #Vets
@SenMarkey Patently dishonest #democratdogwhistles
@HouseDemocrats Cut the lies and bullshit. Obamacare IS a CRAP LAW. Tired of you people lying.  http://dailysignal.com/2017/01/13/new-numbers-show-strong-support-for-repealing-obamacare/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=thf-fb …
opposite of what it claimed it did. Made healthcare more expensive instead of affordable. I know, I know. Judge your intentions
you can't be charitable by giving away other people's money. Oh also, ACA was terrible policy which did precisely the
You voted no to repeal the law that you exempted yourselves from....for the people and stuff. Got it.
please explain this to me.
Thank you Senators for bravely voting against repeal of ACA! Many lives are at stake, incl. mine! I am proud of you! #SaveACA
Thank you for standing up for us. Keep it up. We are with you!
LOVE you all beyond measure. Thanks for fighting for us. Just one of my chemos is $12,000/month! #SaveACA
amazing way to stand up to republican senators!  Stay strong!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!! For standing up for Americans utilizing ACA! Thank you! There is a special place in hell for #GOP
I cried when I heard you as my voice on healthcare.  I'm disabled, desperate & terrified & you spoke for me.  Thank you.
Thank you for denouncing #ACARepeal http://bit.ly/2jdtSKz   #SaveACA #standindivisible #afordablecareact @MaddowBlog @maddow
You went above & beyond.  Not going to use the "patriots" term going around; fascist...you are true patriotic American fighters!
If you need me, I'll be over here watching CSPAN footage of @SenateDems voting no, proudly crying. Thank you for standing up & speaking out.
pathetic attempt to evade the inevitable! out of touch career politicians still don't get it !!
Enroll in the crappy long wait Obamacare networks - pay too much, get lackluster doctors and report back in 3 months ! Morons
Partisan politics combined with lame slogans disrespects the intelligence of the people. Why you lost.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR STANCE and for shouting over the gavel. We're watching, and we support you for standing up for us.
Thank you. Keep up the fight.
Very proud of the stand @SenateDems took for the American people last night. It will be a tough fight, but I'm heartened by your tenacity.
you are the party of no, no performance, no integrity, no truth , no due process, so was else is new
you don't get it ! 
You dems will never be in power again! 
Please keep talking like this! Please!!!
Trump 2017!
"Who is this, Dwain stop trying too buttfuck us and put reality back on the line"
.@senatedems #CleanHouse.13 of your members voted against lower prescription drugs,including @CoryBooker. http://ln.is/www.senate.gov/legis/BePzF …
Politics is sickening. Trump said he would replace w/something better. Can we at least WAIT UNTIL HE TAKES OFFICE?
made fools of yourself today. #notaffordable forced onto Am ppl. ..a LOT have lost their doc & prems escalated #obamalies
@SenMarkey Not enough! What about the 13 betrayers? And the one who couldn't be bothered to vote??? Disgusting Trojan Dems!
...obamacare is dust...
@RyanPimentel - @SpeakerRyan and his minions are the real death panels.
@SenMarkey dose this mean the tax penalty is gone too?
Great job!
From the same people who killed #singlepayer. Get off ur butts,quit fund raising & start representing the American ppl
Thank you for your heroic efforts.
Shut up! I can`t afford the stupid deductibles, you morons! Screw your DEATHCARE!!!
@realDonaldTrump @wikileaks ! America is already sick, thanks 2 BHO & Dems! ACA=IS NOT AFFORDABLE! Plan WAS always meant to FAIL
Why did so many Dems vote against the Sanders amendment, then? I'm especially shocked by @CoryBooker
Bought out like Repubs
once you take a bribe from big pharma you're stuck in their back pockets.
I did but they don't listen
But 12 voted AGAINST cheaper drug prices because they are in bed with big pharma.  Booker, Murray..even Cruz and Paul voted yes.
so proud of everyone who fought for the the best interest of the people. Thank you and please keep it up.
Thank you for standing against these craven monsteres disguised as human representatives!
Repeal ACA. #thisiswhatnohopefeelslike
do you guys have ANY clout?  Really....do you?
Very Shameful that you post then and then just NOW vote against Amendment (Klobuchar Amdt. No. 178 ) @SenSanders
Senator Bob Casey D-PA owes Americans an explanation.  Since I know staff won't write why, I will write
Please add an amendment repealing Congress' insurance w/any #ACARepeal #UnInsureCongress
we are sick of the constant bickering, the lies, the fraud in the DNC and also republican establishment!
HOW JUVENILE!  we have millions with NO INSURANCE Obamacare is failing! Allow Trump to REPLACE IT
Keep up the good fight. We are with you.
@SheWhoVotes You need to do more than just vote no. The @GOP are a bunch of cowards. Healthcare is a human rights issue!
Thank you! The American people stand with you.
Thank you for your support of the citizens of Pennsylvania.  Please don't give up on us.
The only sick ppl r the democrats, your insane maybe Prozac would help.
Elections have consequences.  There will be chaos in the insurance industry so fight to win Democrat seats in 2018.
Thank you for voting "no"
and 13 of you voted against lowering prescription costs. Both parties are worthless
What about your members who voted no? The cowards who won't stand up for us? The frauds who take money and ignore the people?
Thank you Senators for upholding the values of America when most are afraid to.
Please explain ur NO vote on the Sanders-Klobuchar plan to import drugs from Canada. DYING to know why. #2018 #ACA
Keep standing up. Let GOP own the debacle alone. Hope gerrymandering/voter oppression doesn't get crazy so wiser minds can fix
@SenBobCasey THANK YOU! Help us!
I have found that the people who support ACA are not on it/have other insurance like Congress..
Our Republic voted for Trump's vision.  Support him or Americans will turn their back on you.
@MichaelThomas82 make America sick again?ask the people who have to search around for weeks just to find a doctor on obama care
thanks for voting for me keeping $2,700/month premium. That's a $33,000/year tax + a$6,000 deduct before I get any benefit
Health Insurance does not keep people from getting sick.
#Resist&Replace2018/20 let's bring sanity back in 2018 & 2020.
Please speak for all your Americans who need health coverage. Don't let them win.
Thank you for fighting for Americans & what is right- No #ACA repeal!
Thank you for fighting the good fight! You stood up for America, while the #GOP betrayed her. Thanks to @RandPaul also.
you are holding on to a ticking time bomb, be careful! You own Obamacare politically, ends in disaster no matter what #wiseup
Please keep fighting. No one wants this, well 70% don't. They are not representing the people, just #Trump and #GOP power lust
Look beyond the rhetoric - please
Thank you. Now you all need to be all over TV tomorrow, letting people know the GOP are the merchants of death.
@KamalaHarris Keep fighting for me from Redwood City. @SenFeinstein get well soon and don't give up an inch against GOP..
I lit Sen. Ron Johnson's voicemail up.  I'll be back for round 2 tomorrow.
Thank you for fighting for us, but slogan, "dont make America sick again" just fails to deliver a punch.
@deejay90192 YOU tell every hometown paper tomorrow that every US family  affected! By GOP actions from birth control,kids to 26
Thank you for fighting for us...I wish there were more of you and less of the GOP
@jaketapper @chucktodd @maddow @BrianRoss @BWilliams @GStephanopoulos @wolfblitzer @NYGovCuomo Please REPORT GOP has NO plan!
But America voted to be sick. Bigly. #obamacare #election2016 #consequences
No, Americans voted for HRC. Trump won on a technicality. Stop lying.
House & senate went solidly red, re POTUS the fact that it was even close is a loss IMO.
My family's world is going to collapse if you cannot protect pre-existing condition.
Um, not all of us do FB.  Alternatives?
your 1st line of work is to make ppl know that Ocare is ACA. They still don't know that!!! They want ACA not Ocare....silly ppl.
Make sure you tell your constituents that not only is GOP repealing Obamacare, but ACA as well. Many unaware they are same.
Anyone in Kentucky needs to tell neighbors that Kentucky Connect is Obamacare.  Maybe they will call Congress
Over 20 million Americans rely on Obamacare. R U telling them their lives don't matter? Focus on the problem. INSURANCE GREED
thank you for the hard work you're doing. Appreciated. Please by more vocal and do whatever you can to stop these monsters.
Why do they want to kill us?
GOP wants to harvest our souls for Fel Magic 
Hahahahahhaha!!! I knew they looked like something familiar!
After 8 years of waiting to gain power, it is incredible to me that Republicans HAVE NO PLAN. NOTHING. ZERO. ZILCH. NADA.

Fight harder for us. You know damn well they don't give a hoot abt phone calls or letters. They want poor people to die quietly in a corner
Guess it's back to clogging up the emergency rooms for 30 million. Make sure you post each Senate Republican's home hospital.
good idea!
thank you. keep fighting for us -- we need you!!
Maybe gop should of tried to amend it instead of doing nothing.
Don't give up
I hope when this falls apart and it will that the American ppl remember it was you that stood up for us. THANK YOU. @SenSchumer
thank you Senator Schumer and Dems who keep after him.
You better fucking fight for us.  Trump is a sociopath.  We NEED you. Don't be nice!

Thank you
Thank you.
tell @GOP #HandsOffSocialSecurity #HandsOffMedicare #Handsofmedicade
Dems crafted a program that isn't working for people.  Man up!
where's the Republican plan?
intelligent blue states should set up their own Obamacare and let red states suffer the consequences.
What about us who are TRAPPED in red states ?
