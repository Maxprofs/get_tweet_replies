how about it's time to call out the Pres elect and ask him why he seems to kiss Putins butt so much. He is a traitor.
Bob Casey - Pennsylvania's real Senator.
I agree wholeheartedly, Senator. But make sure you also look into Mitch McConnell's complicity as well.
Bobs number 1 fan
@wbrewyou  Your first 7 words are true but you should get your priorities straight.
Like this was investigated? http://nyti.ms/2ihV22p  #hypocrisymuch?
thank you.
yup, time to put all that practice with emails to good use
@Picatryx we need you to say that you will stand against Trump and his agenda #FearNothing
I will stand and I #FearNothing
than you Senator Casey
how about  a special prosecutor for Hillary's crimes she broke the laws and gets off Scott free. Where's your outrage on her.
@metaquest
meanwhile bob Casey takes millions of Soros money
so true- thank you!
Sure. Now that they are hacking electrical grids in US, perhaps they'll think about doing their jobs!
@davidpsdem Impeached Clinton for a BJ what does DT get if he f**ked America?
It is imperative! Blurred lines of right and wrong should not deter us from addressing this!!!!

thank you Senator.
@donnabrazile Don't poke the Bear. Are you that obtuse? The same Russia Prez Obama mocked Romney 4 ID'ing as #1 threat in 2012?
Yes!  Don't let McConnell control this with his committee.  A special open committee is the only justification for Americans
good luck with the do nothing Congress, worthless as tits on a bull. Only want more money & power for themselves @Khanoisseur
there is money trail to Comey.
thank you for your patriotism!! I am a constituent, and I support you!!
Thank you for working to protect our country from foreign attack! True patriotism!
Thank you!
Force Merrick Garland or delay EC vote for prez
@SallyResistsDJT also Sen. Casey please protect ACA, SS, Medicare and Medicaid. Pennsylvanians are counting on you.
#Crosscheck voter purges. Not just Russia
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1781559/posts …. You're a hypocrite you take money from George Soros.  Please advise how you're not influenced by this
@donnabrazile And charge Trump for his involvement in Russian conspiracy to hack our  electoral system.
#CriminalTrump
wow you're believing all the lies put forth by the mainstream media. Fool
And DJT.  If Russia's hacking is treason, then DJT should be tried for treason as well.
time for Dems to resist Trump. Fight for the people. Do not allow GOP any of their austerity agenda.
this constituent agrees. Thanks
What about all the Soros money you take? Isn't that another foreign entity swaying your policy? Please advise?
thank you so much for supporting the sanctions! Russia's involvement is not something we should "move on" from with no action.
you either you do job ON Russia or be doomed doing it FOR Russia! @SenSherrodBrown @robportman @RepMarcyKaptur
What did Trump know, and when did he know it? #RussianHacking. Also: Trump/Giuliani/FBI NY Office conspiracy. #TheResistance
@metaquest what about Trumps multitude of conflicts of interest this is a debacle
Republican leadership is going to be Trump's puppet. Ryan,Mitch will say "yes sir" on every nomination, proposal.chao is Tr sec
It's well past time to stop traitor from benefitting from his acts of treason. DO SOMETHING TO STOP HIM
Not to mention, the associated outright collusion of Trump campaign and team with Russia.
@HerMillennials be sure to spend as much time investigating trump and russia as those stupid emails and benghazi
@PrincessBravato are we going to get an impeachment  also.
@metaquest read please !!!
ICYMI: Trump is fine dropping nukes on Europe and Middle East + has been trying to partner with Russia for 29 years http://qz.com/871436/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-putin-and-trump-release-statements-that-hint-at-increased-nuclear-armament/ …
@SenateMajLdr WE want a special select committee to investigate the Russian hacking which U knew abt bef election! DO IT!
We need a full investigation. FULL. What they did and how AND about Trump's business and campaign ties to Russia.
Absolutely. A rigorous and comprehensive investigation. With all due dispatch.
@donnabrazile how can Congress investigate the allies they are in bed with, and besides we see them as Russians too....
republicans have sold out USA and their souls to satan in order to obtain power.. worthless all
My question is where. Was you at back in Aug 2015 when the Russians tried hacking into military emails..why wait until now
Agreed! How can we help make this happen?
That is just a start Senator there are many more issues to investigate dealing with Trump.
@irisbreeze yes, yes it is. We're still here, and we're still waiting for our representatives to actually represent Americans.
Investigate Trump first.  Let's have a run-off. Paper ballots that can't be hacked. Russia's interference will be history.
thank you for standing with the people of Pennsylvania and on the right side of history!!
just appoint an independent commission - no need for congress
@donnabrazile You are my Senator..PLEASE keep the pressure on and DO NOT let up..PLEASE
@donnabrazile So you're saying that Mitt Romney was RIGHT about the Russians way back in 2012? "The 1980s called." HAHA! #dopes
Please do your job well. You are the only country which can save the world from Russian aggression.
thank you for your strong stance on this important issue
@MarilynAEdmonds Actually time for independent commission, can not trust McConnell and Trump.
FBI and himeland security both said that is false the Russians did nothing this was all over a false article
.@SenBobCasey Russia is - if I may be so crude - totally fucking America up the ass.
AND Trump's collusion! And his team's collusion. Like Bannon, Flynn, etc.
Russia's meddling must be addressed severely; who knows what else they will mess with?
Right U are @SenBobCasey. Now it’s up to @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan to put country before party—or fail to do so.
Time for Congress to do its job on Russia as well-convene a special, select Committee to investigate Russian hacking.
Sanctions are irrelevant.  UNDO the damage.
Please investigate Trump and how he ties into these hacks. What did he know when?
I appreciate having one Senator from Pennsylvania who is paying attention to possible Russian election hacking.  Thank-you!
Does special select mean independent bi-partisan investigation or the just between us do we can cover it up investigation?
And what did Trump know and when did he know it?
@JeffersonObama 
Thank you! Please work on Repub Senators 2. I know Collins, Thune, Coker are true patriots as McCain & Graham!
@donnabrazile The GOP had Benghazi and now the DEM's have Hackgate. Americans wanted special select committee in Benghazi. SMH

russia already had a test case for usa: ukraine https://www2.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/GWASHU_DEMO_13_4/D761010XT7H55W67/D761010XT7H55W67.pdf …
@Khanoisseur what say you???? @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn
.@SenBobCasey Thank you for supporting Obama's call for sanctions against Russia! So proud to have you as my senator.
give of evidence and fix un-democratic DNC if you want us bad, right now you are slightly below Putin.
Thank you for your integrity--I'm so proud to have you as my senator!
Agreed and yet our feckless President-elect tells us we should just "move on". What's he hiding...
@donnabrazile yeah sure - whatever you say
@donnabrazile 

Right Senator Casey.
thank you!  You have my support and my vote in 2018.
Thank you, Senator Casey!
why bother, if it's like the rest of y'all's investigations? #worsethanablindsquirrel
No need to investigate something that was investigated.
You and congress had all the time to do so, but was enjoying the emailgate and fake news.
time for congress to start thinking "impeach"
Republicans Congress will not do anything that may jeopardize their chance to have a monopoly over the Supreme Court.
please continue to push for a full investigation. Country first.
Thank you my Senator Casey, Please stay focused on standing up to Trump. We have your back.
And investigate the conflicts of interests and the Emoluments clause. Don't give #PUSSYGRABBER consent to ignore it.
100% support you on this. It's a direct attack. if true, this should realign our fp as much as 9/11 did - phila, PA
With respect, senator, you really needed to bring in your state for the D team to make this happen. You lost, we all lost.
is AMERICA this stupid???
@CNN @democracynow @TheYoungTurks
@SenBobCasey
How about bringing Joe McCarthy & the House Un-American Activities Committee while you at it!

if no1 is arguing the authenticity of the data leaked by these so called hacks, what's worse, hacks or child sex trafficking?
thought NYC is a sanctuary city,72 hrs won't work trying to toss out Russians, the comrades can stay a long as they want
Thank you.  This is important.  This is your chance to be a real leader.
, we need help in Liberia to eradicate corruption and end poverty.
@NormOrnstein YES, SenCasey! GOP complicity MUST b exposed;T's campaign's collusion MUST b exposed; Russn assets here, forfeit
@ginag63 Congress hasn't worked for years.
James Comey, too, right?
@donnabrazile & Trump with his campaign team!
@donnabrazile thank you
Ok.. stop talking about it and just do it!
@JuliaDavisNews
And investigate trump & his cxn to a spy agency of a nation at active hybrid war with the US
#DeworkinReport
obama strikes back at russia for hacking

Shut up - Trump will handle. Stay out of his way when he gets to DC. Your out next cycle
time expose trump/Putin plan b4 election, all too fishy. Don't b afraid to challenge illegal election. R's wld
@donnabrazile time for special prosecutor on that criminal liar Clinton
what is your viewpoint on the Israel UN vote?
@ggrushko
Can't you add your support to @LindseyGrahamSC & @SenJohnMcCain? Can you add your name to their letter?

@donnabrazile senator zero
@NealKRed we don't have time for That, look at Trumps ties 
He asked them to do this  they did !
look at #TrumpLeaks @funder
the server in his tower communicating with Russian servers & statements similar to Russian propoganda
I cannot believe nobody will do anything
absolutely. Especially investigate McConnell & Giuliani's role
Find out how much Trump knew about what was going on.
@donnabrazile Select Committee to ferret out the fat kid in the basement.
we need special prosecutor - they're not only for sex problems.
I concur. It seems to go so much deeper. Don't let the Republicans stop the independent investigation.
@donnabrazile @SenBobCasey u are part of her down fall like it or not.
Way to change the subject away from Obama & Kerry screwing over Israel!
Keep McConnell off the committee he will gum up the works&mess the investigation up.
@DrCrane72
thank you senator Casey!
@NormOrnstein Yes, an open public hearing. Citizens deserve to hear UNEDITED facts of this Russian meddling into our election.
Indubitably!
Thank you, Senator.Please continue to speak out on this issue.Your constituents & fellow Democrats need to see your leadership.
@NormOrnstein Thank you, Senator!  We need others like you w/ spines!!
. @SenBobCasey @DanteB4u Not a select committee... a special prosecutor independent from Congress. Give it the attention it deserves.
Right! 30 to cover Hillary but 0 for a hostile country infiltrating our election? Something's up with a lot of the GOP.
& do what? China has been hacking us 4 years & you guys go out and play off with them.Do you plan 2 Invgt the rigging by #DNC
smoke screen to try de-legitimize Ppl electing @realDonaldTrump. We elected him eyes wide open. OBama/ Dems needs to stop now
you're a hypocrite Bob. Why not Ban Soros for his meddling in our elections? Or are you one of his lap dogs #draintheswamp
Russian hacking unlikely given what NONPARTISAN experts have uncovered
https://consortiumnews.com/2016/12/12/us-intel-vets-dispute-russia-hacking-claims/ …
and then you can have an investigation into the DNC and how they rigged the primaries
Yes! I am a PA voter. PLEASE fight HARD for this. The citizens need answers and transparency on this!
Seth Rich,Guccifer are not Russian !
Seek The Facts !
I want to see a Jury Trial !
Evidence always Rules First !
Stop the Lies!
So what are you doing about it? Do your job for the American people. Remember: you work for us!
But will it be stopped once findings get ugly?  Like JFK  HSC did; cousin Donovan Gay (RIP)was lead investigator
I thought there is evidence in this hacking? Why not provide the evidence or am I missing something that there isn't any?
https://twitter.com/ghhshirley/status/814583358567149568@SenBobCasey …
What can citizens do to make this happen? I support this completely. Carla, Pittsburgh PA
