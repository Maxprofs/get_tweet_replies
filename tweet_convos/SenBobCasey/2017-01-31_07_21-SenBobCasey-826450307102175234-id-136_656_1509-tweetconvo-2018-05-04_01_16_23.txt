@SenSchumer No, she will eliminate common core so we can help students more.
ALL KOOL-AID DRINKERS!
Obviously you don't want change to help give  students more choices .We need to bring it back to states
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes ...anyone who is out to help our Country!  Shame on all DEMS!!!!!
Shame on the BIGOTED WAR MONGERS
I wonder who you will be calling war mongers when ISIS show up on your doorstep!
IF THEY DO ITS BECAUSE TRUMPLETHINSKIN HAS POKED THE LIONS
It's because Obama is part of ISIS and was selling our Country to the Devil!
No one believes you
Completely not true!

PATHETIC-CALLING PEOPLE ASHES OF THOSE FROM THE OVENS.  A DISGRACE! @JoyAnnReid @jonfavs

Jeff Sessions is even more dangerous. Please oppose him.
yea soros paid each of my siblings and me 3 head of cattle to protest, don't be jealous cause you chose the wrong side
actually it made paid protesters more valuable so my take is even bigger for the tax day March, nice try

@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes This is par for the course under the blundering and ill prepared dog that caught the car theme
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes worried, because my kid is almost out of high school. She'll need a student loan for college
@SenSchumer 
Would you please reject Besty DeVos cuz she doesn't know abt the ICDA and others Disabilities also LBGT too!
@ @BetsyDeVos @nytimes - vote NO
We need Educators not Socialites leading our Educational system. Public schools must be improved not lost
you are gone next year!

@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes yes! Thank you Senator!
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Well why didn't you say so earlier. Such a reliable source as NY TIMES has never been wrong
Now the ungrammatical plagiarist has been confirmed. God help us all.
You believe the Times? Investigate on your own. Encouraging all PA relatives to NOT vote Casey.
NY times for information? That's funny
Under her, neither me, my sister, or my nephew would have any right to an education because IDEA/504.
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes So, since the @nytimes said it...it's Gospel?   Don't think so!  You're out to get
..contd
Hey Bob. remember you're election is coming up soon. Won't vote for you if you obstruct & lie.
Thank you, Senator! I choose to send my child to private school. Taxes need to support public schools.
an evasive conclusion.NYTimes aside-how about some independent thinking/analysis re school choice?
CUE THE DEM WAR ON WOMEN.  SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR ALL OF YOU
Remember when Chuck Schumer cried over this?

Nah, me neither.
She's in loser!
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes All Rethuglicans in committee voted YES.  How do we stop this? I'm scared 4 my kids' education
@SenSchumer No on DeVoss and the destruction of public education!
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/260471-schumer-refugee-pause-may-be-necessary#.WI-Plx5bF60.twitter …
NY Times is gospel right? LOL Vote yes.
you need to stop quoting the activist/biased NYT, just a hyper-partisan hit job
Everything about this administration is unparalleled in the U.S. 
We need to get rid of them.
school choice!!!
public education isn't all it's cracked up to be when it's not educating rather indoctrinating. So.....
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Really have you seen the public schools. Give her a chance and see what she can do.
@SenSchumer the New York Tunes is not the voice of America, you do not think for yourself. You vote your party line only
NY Times, wow, that sure is an honest news source.
Thank you for your No vote.
@Vicious2707 @BetsyDeVos @nytimes  Yep, and she WILL BE passed by senate anyway!!! BIG TALKER ARENT YA Sen. Casey?!!!!!
thank you Senator Casey for voting NO to @BetsyDeVos
thank you Senator Casey! 
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes @BarackObama 's education policies resulted in regressions in math, sciences & lunches. FACT!
sad day for our children
Crybaby Dems won't have a party in 2 years. Obstructionist losers
again ur not listening to the voters of PA. The Democratic agenda ceased to exist back in November. 2018
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes And the NY times is not a huge Union / Progressive supporter that would never skew their view
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes or maybe she will energize education senator. Currently test scores of r children have stalled
Thank you Send Casey. This retired PA appreciates how hard u work 4 us
The fish wrap of record is not the standard bearer for looney left policy.
Yes, because the current inner city public school system is top notch
She must be stopped. Ed is too impt to leave up to charlatans and snake oil salespeople. We won't be bamboozled, led astray... @wkamaubell
@AltMtRainier @BetsyDeVos @nytimes  The only person more unqualified to run the Dept of Education is Donald T.
Oppose DeVos and Price with all you've got!!
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes If this means that you you will vote NO on DeVos,  THANK YOU!
do whatever you need to block this woman. Another unfit to run our education system. Disgusting.
keep digging in. Will be white only schools . All others to second class place , with handicapped and ethnic unfunded
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Another Washingtin dinosaur speaks and nobody cares. You are irrelevant.
@bobbybnews @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Such bull Instead of listening to biased political Rhetoric read up on this woman
.@SenateDems stand united and vote NO on @BetsyDeVos  - @SenBobCasey @SenSchumer @nytimes #GaslightingAmerica #ImpeachTrump #VoteNoDevos
I'm trying to contact @SenToomey but his voicemail is full. Thank you Sen Casey for keeping PA residents informed
as a registered PA voter, I will fight just as hard so you aren't reelected, vote for DeVos
good, public education is a travesty teaching lies instead of facts
she ruined education in Michigan. To the point parents cried. #notodevos
@SenSchumer All she wants is a “return on investment”. Sad she can just think she can buy her way in
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes 4 DeVos, Price, Munusion block. SCOTUS nom filab. Force nuclear. Rem POTUS44 nominee.
"Fake Tears @SenSchumer" -@POTUS

@BetsyDeVos @nytimes
The question is, "Can public education after 8 years of the Obama Admin sink any lower than it is now"

Louisiana's education system is a disaster thanks to her & Jindall. Seriously a catastrophe&epic fail.
So is the rest of America's.  Blame them for all of it?
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Remember PA voters Midterms in 2018 for our elected officials. You must vote!
@apwriter @BetsyDeVos @nytimes IN OTHER WORDS BLOW IT UP!
Since when does the @nytimes know whats best for the education system.
the #nytimes is all left wing fake news. No fair & balanced!
Dear Bob, our education is a fiasco. Low global scores, unaffordable liberal colleges.
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Doesn't matter. Feds will soon be removed from public education. It destroys kids.
@SenSchumer @SenBobCasey @BetsyDeVos @nytimes you really need to take a box of ducolax you are full of it
Our public education is currently a fiasco........ Have you seen our test scores?
@SenSchumer  @nytimes how about per suing term limits for career politicians?
BS approve the cabinet. This is why we hate the 2 party BS in congress. Damn fools
current education system is broken. We need @BetsyDeVos to fix it by the Grace of God.

@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes yes and not just K-12.  Higher ed is at risk.  Stop her.
At risk? I'm not sure where all the $ from insane tuition goes, i guess to libs.
If the NYT says it, we know it is #FakeNews.
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes Casey and Schumer how much money did the teachers unions give to your campaigns?
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes You guys are like Obama.Never going to be elected again, make as much damage before you leave!
I hope this means a NO
@SenSchumer @BetsyDeVos @nytimes you will lose again in 2018 ! Obstructing the will of the people
Stop obstructing I live in PA we voted for Trump. Support your constituents! I'll remember that 4 election
