Tonight, Acting AG Sally Yates was fired for standing up in defense of our Constitution. Our nation owes her a debt of gratitude.
I'm looking forward to the American people firing @SenBobCasey!
OMG I live in Pennsylvania and I am going to work for his defeat!
amen He needs to go!
To iranunaware - not in ur lifetime baby  
You are wrong and a pathetic representation of PA!
where were you when Obama was putting forth all of the unconstitutional EO?
@dale_bernadette @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @nytimes   I am thinking u are fake news Sen. Casey.
Oh he's fake. Just ain't news. POS removed me from email responses. Done nothing for PA.
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Not according to lawyers. Obama banned Iraqis for six months.
CASEY when did you get appointed to the federal bench#political hack
Why did you never bitch about Snobama doing it? Oh forgot, he's a progressive nutjob.
My hat is off 2 AG Yates.;need more brave & courageous gov. emp. like her who has convict 2 b4 rght.
Hey Bob remember this state was red for the first time in a long time maybe you need to change w/ the times or be replaced LFOD
she's our hero and let's follow her and stomp on Trump
if so, why aren't you immediately seeking impeachment?
who r u?  Self deport 
what are her options we need someone with integrity in positions. #SupportYates
This wasn't politically motivated at all, right? A leftover from previous administration. Move on.
Will you consider withholding consent until the travel ban is lifted? #withholdconsent
Legal scholars disagree with you. You're protecting Democratic instinct to protect party.
If you truly believe that Senator, I expect you to take appropriate action against it.
where were U acting like an ass when Obama and the 4 Presidents before him did this?
Bannon created a "shock" event. Very important lesson from Heather Richardson, professor of history @ Boston College.
Speaking on a Executive order you can't change. Take it to Supreme Court.
Explain how #COTUS covers people that are NOT on US soil.

@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is right. @realDonaldTrump's exec order is unconstitutional and indefensible. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/attorney-general-civil-rights-refugee.html …

#SenatorBobCasey #StoptheHateandLies #DoYourJob #DraintheSwamp @realDonaldTrump
Please support the rule of law over the executive in this matter. Without respect for the judiciary, democracy crumbles

@habpipes @nytimes so, how long before you can all actually DO something about it? About HIM?

How can you violate the Constitutional rights of non citizens when they don't have thiase rights?
SO IMPEACH HIM!!! how far does he have to go to prove he is a dictator!?!
Ooooo....the NY Times....well then it MUST be true BWAHAHA #MAGA

 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
whatever it takes Sessions appointment must be blocked!
Thank you Senator for being outspoken in your opposition to this #MuslimBan. Please keep fighting
Wrong!  @POTUS is within purview of US Constitution.  Stop trying to make Sharia the law of the land.
I am so happy that we finally have a POTUS that doesn't play the "political" game! Great job!!
Glad to know you are a SCOTUS now.
is not!
you're next, Boob, I meant Bob

Well good thing no one has to worry about her anymore 
Were you as outraged when Obama implemented the same policy a few years ago? #crickets
Wrong

This lunatic has to be stopped.
Sally Casey showed courage and integrity which is what this country needs. A true hero in a dark time
Again, Casey, you don't know what your talking about.  Some cheering you on aren't in PA
Put the country ahead of your party.  I'm in PA and can't wait to vote you out.
assume you spoke up when Clinton Carter and Obama did same
Trump just fired the Attorney General!
Seriously! You can't fire everyone who disagrees with you! That's not how real life works!
and Mango Mussolini fired her for standing up for the Constitution.
Pls speak out strongly against her termination; she was upholding duty to Constitution, he is not.
acting attorney general Sally Yates has been fired. New one needs to be approved by Senate correct?
yeah, Dana Boente was just filled-in for Sally Yates' position until Sessions gets confirmed by Senate.
The inmates don't run the asylum....anymore! Obama is gone!
HE FIRED HER.  PLEASE VOTE NO TO SESSIONS ...
and he fires her.
#RESIST
Evidently u haven't read the Constitution. 8 USC 1182. Gives the President authority to do this.
GO Ms. Yates!!!
how unconstitutional? even lib Dershowitz says Yates made a serious mistake - "This is holdover heroism."
@ItIzBiz @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Oh wah! Our team lost! Let's protest!
thank you for standing up for what is right.
Can @SenBobCasey organize resistance to & slow-walking of Sessions' appointment?
no. He can't organize his sock drawer!
she is my hero!
Acting Attorney General, read what you swore to defend and uphold, or resign immediately!
defend and uphold Constitution moron-Not a orange draft .. real pic
ty senator
No Sessions confirmation 2B made until ban lifted! @SenateGOP your opportunity 2 defend USA values.

Then why can't we impeach him now!???
the real foreign interference & compromising influence in American  justice system.. #SelloutSally
THIS IS BRILLIANT! @KStewKrew @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @nytimes MUST RT!!!
No, it isn't, but panderers and the cesspool that is Capital hill should be flushed. @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
How are you voting on #FascistPOTUS appointments?
Fire her Obama loving ass
I love how Trump supporter think they know the law better than Yates.

Yes, Senator!  Each brave act to protect the Constitution must be recognized and supported. #SallyYates is a big damn hero!
Senator Casey you are disgrace in playing politics with National Security! Obama Crony!!!
what's unconstitutional about it?
WE ELECTED A VINDICTIVE VENGEFUL MANIACAL MANIAC! WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO STOP THIS?
BS!
Completely Constitutional. Read the document before you comment on it Drama Queen.
Bob it's not even an election year.  Calm down.
@SenCoryGardner do not support Trump on this!
can't say I agree with you there Senator. Why not get busy and confirm Mr. Sessions.
a court has not decided constitutionality yet. Constitution is for citizens, not immigrants though.
what part of constitution deals with citizens of other countries?
I appreciate (and support you) for saying this.
Might want to actually read the Constitution and the authority it grants the President before making such stupid comments!
Senators really should be more educated. smh. -VJ
To "real" vinny - ur wrong u need to read up. Ur lying fake news days are over  
what's great about information is that people can read that article themselves. -VJ
Haha just bc something is in writing doesn't mean it's true. False equivalence no go
Straw man argument. I never stated writing makes it true. See? -VJ
We know what Obama did but Obama never gave an exception to Christian refugees.
Neither did Trump. That's CNN spin. Isn't real. -VJ
Is that what Fox News said
@wbrewyou @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Time to make this state a solid red!
She has to do it because no one in Administration has balls to stand up to traitorous @POTUS #Trump.
Look up US Immigration Law you fool & simply enforce it!
yes! Ride SALLY Ride!
Federal Immigration Law Section 1182(f). It's legal folks.

You're quoting an outdated version of the law. Check out https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-1016.html#0-0-0-180 …, from USCIS.
thank you.
lies
That law was revised since 1952. Check out the first paragraph of the USCIS https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-1016.html#0-0-0-180 …
carter used this to keep Iranians out.
I'm quoting federal law. You're quoting WordPress.
your illogical as there are laws since and have been used in history.
that's not for you to decide, since it wasn't unconstitutional the when the last 5 presidents did it
@wbrewyou @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I will be helping to make sure you are out of here in 2018!
She is what a hero looks like!
How come Obama was allowed to do it in 2012???????

Thank you again, Senator Casey, for standing up for what is right. Proud to have you in office representing me.
u r a moron
You're OBSTRUCTING & creating an atmosphere of LAWLESSNESS. SUPPORT our President and WORK WITH Him!
no its not read the constitution 212f
She's absolutely wrong, as are you; it is constitutional and must be defended. her, voters will U.
shame you won't defend your own State of PA.
U.S. Law: 8 U.S. Code 1182 –– Pundits, Politicians, Candidates Need to Get Over Themselves
no it's not. President has the right to curb immigration any way they see fit. Look it up.
Hope you both updated your resumes. 8 U.S. Code § 1182 - Inadmissible aliens...The law.
she should be fired. She is a virus of the left over losers.
No one has a right to enter this country so maybe you should read the construction and declaration.
seeing Casey get ruined in his own tweet is delicious.
it's sad when elected officials don't know the law of the land
Exactly why is it unconstitutional Bob? Democrats are the party of dictatorship. Last time I checked
You were a US senator not a SC justice.But I forgot, your are one of the great legal minds of the age
So this unelected democrat underling launches a hack stunt and you say she is a hero I guess...
She is NOT the President is she! Talk about pissing on the actual constitution! Dictator Bob!
We need you to do something about it. You and your fellow senators. Please, stand up for AMERICA, not Trumperica.
another dumb lib who fail to comprehend the constitution and laws
please vote against Sessions, DeVos, Pruitt and Price. They are all a radical departure from this constituent’s American values
Not this American's values!
We're with you! Talk to Toomey!
Follow the law, the checks and balances, and the constitution. Bullies with no idea what they are doing cannot be above the law!
Thank you Senator - from PA! #StopPresidentBannon
Really! You know it is NOT unconstitutional.Supreme court has validated presidential powers here!
Bob...You are a hack playing a dangerous game as you make this crap up as you go along. She's fired!!
BOB, WHAT WILL YOU AND YOUR HACK TRAITOR PARTY NOT DO? This is settled law! Guess the war is on...
Deport Melania the KGB Russian spy
What would Sen Casey know about anything this man is worthless to PA he has to go next election
It's these sorts of actions/games that got @realDonaldTrump  elected in the first place.
I don't support the ban, but she need to do her job!! Or get fired
Her job is to follow the constitution

They arent doing us ANY good. Theyve tried to stop NOTHING & we're sick of it.
