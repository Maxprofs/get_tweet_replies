@SenToomey Senator Casey,  Please talk with Senator Toomey  let him know we can't afford to hurt PA PUBLIC SCHOOLS!  #noDevos
Thank you for listening to your constituents! Your NO vote on Trump's nominees earns my YES vote on your re-election!

2/3 @SenBobCasey @BarackObama:"up or down as they did"!As Colbert said"What happened during Obama's 2nd term??!!Oh yeah!"Throughout my life
You finally showed up for work.
1/3 @SenBobCasey @BarackObama :Hooray!Another step in the right direction.And How Dare Hypocrites like McConnell order Democrats to vote
This member of your constituency will make sure to vote against you in the election

You and the rest of Democrats under Obama didn't do jack. Now all of a sudden you want to puff your chest and pound on it LOSER
Thank you!

I think your decision was partisan 
And a mistake,
3/3 @SenBobCasey @BarackObama: My dad&I got the short end but if we  complained,"WE were being UNFAIR!"!I say ENOUGH!We Deserve Justice!
Thank you Senator. You are listening and hearing the voices of your constituents

You need to vote for these excellent candidates. Why are you playing politics when you should do what's best for America?

Congratulations to Rex Tillerson getting appointed Sec of State! Obviously your not as relevant as you think you are!

Thank you Senator! Can you talk some sense into Senator Toomey?
DEMAND an Independent Russian Espionage Investigation away from Congress so no Trumper sabotage #GetThemALLout #NoPence
Wrong. Russian agg. has always been confronted with equally sinister yet pofitable American agg. And also better
Thank you for standing for what is right, Senator. Please also vote no on Price and DeVos.
Thank you Senator Casey!
, you're a dish rag, have you ever had an individual thought?  You follow Obama, Reid, and now Schumer to the letter.
please vote against Betsy DeVos also.  Our children and teachers  will perish with her in charge.
Good work Senator.---from Glenmoore, Chester Co. Keep the fight!
Thank you Sen. Casey. Now what are we going to do about that other senator from PA? The one on the wrong side of every issue!

@DavidHenry6abc http://endcitizensunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Web-DeVos.pdf â€¦. Sen Toomey is apparently bought and paid for by DeVos.  Thank you Sen Casey
@POTUS Lost again eh Senator Groundhog!Didn't know you were such a war monger for going toe to toe with the Rooski's.
So you think today's Russia with less than 1/2 our population and crappy economy is really a threat to US??
Let alone Europe & their population and economy which combined dwarfs Russia.Soviet Union is gone Bob...
Now you and the dictator dems want to be seen as standing tall to kick the Russian bear?
Where were you guys in the 80's when it mattered? Oh yeah Reagan was a cowboy gonna blow up the world...
so we need to make nice with them and do a nuclear freeze and leave Eastern Europe occupied. Faker!! Shame on you!!!
Really appreciate that you inform & keep us updated.
Thank you, Senator. Please tell your colleague @SenToomey that we are calling and faxing. NO on DeVos.
you are clueless!
thank you, senator! Now if only you could convince your colleague Toomey to vote against DeVos!
You have shown extraordinarily poor judgement since the inauguration. You're wrong on this too.  #notmysenator #recallcasey
Thank you Sir.  Please contact Sen Toomey.  He is dodging calls. #Resist #callyourrepresentatives
Thank you for standing up for America! #resist #TrumpMakesAmericaWeak
