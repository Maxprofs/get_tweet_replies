Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!
@realDonaldTrump:At least the judge is taking affirmative action AGAINST him,which is MORE than our REPRESENTATIVES are doing!
Such rhetoric and behavior won't stop until Trump and his cronies are out of office! Question is - When?
Or Senator, how about we hold them accountable to the, big word for you, law?
I agree. I hope congress is watching. America is SCARED of our president.
good you should be scared
Say it on the floor and on the record @SenBobCasey
Stop Him!
disagreeing is fine but calling our elected judges "so called judges" IS reprehensible
I am sure  you have  family, stop  your o bsession with the president  Take  time out to spend with your wife  and  children
really? You just said what!
that you are a moron
hahh hahaha
@POTUS Scranton Bob, in your dictator dem world only you and your ilk can express themselves.Why do U hate the Bill of Rights
if you were an actual human instead of the 56th most well known groundhog in PA, you would be "reprehensible"!
just say LIES.  Time to call him out on it.
@realDonaldTrump I just can't believe Trump is such a baby
And @SenBobCasey did you expect anything more from @RealDonaldTrump?
and get @SenToomey to vote against Pruitt DeVos & Price
Toomey is MIA.. Good luck finding him try Palm Springs
with haters like you after him.... Maybe he just doesn't want talk to you.
hater? Constituent
yes. I'm a Casey hater.
@realDonaldTrump Can he be brought up on charges? 
How about: Creating anxiety and fear with mis-information from the WH?
him and the gop can. But Dems are insisting on 2018. #quislings
@realDonaldTrump These continued attacks on our President are reprehensible. We won't back down Bobby. You stop. Get over it!
The President's attacks on the Constitution are what is reprehensible!
Next attack on US is on this judge and of course you as well turd casey
absolutely disgusting that @realDonaldTrump shows no respect for the judiciary
How do we stop him? This can't continue. He is setting us up for an attack and scapegoat.
@mfrank694 @SenBobCasey (2) SCOTUS case on docket #16-907 re legitimacy of presidency. Call SCOTUS 202-479-3000 (9-5) to
Thank you! I hope you will help press for full wide ranging investigation into Trump's Russian & Business affairs NOW
he doing the wishes of the people who elected him & there is nothing you can do losers!
His debt to Putin is putting is in peril.
I love the way you try to reach @realDonaldTrump where he lives: on Twitter. I hope he listens to you. Good luck, and thanks!
It is a shame you are a PA Senator and embarrassing us working folks. You and Wolf are seeking your own agenda, don't care..
get out
attacks on a federal judge are concerning and delegitimize our judicial branch--unacceptable.
@realDonaldTrump The President is the one causing peril
he's setting the stage for his Reichstag fire.
and by "being the bigger people ", you're putting the planet at risk. Blow the whistle so people can sleep at night
this is his second allusion to authoritarian state between this and sending troops to Chi to take away guns.
always blame somebody besides yourself @potus
-- if something happens (God forbid), look to Bannon and Putin: dirty trick masters supporting Trump.
when we finally unite trump will no longer be our president.
Mr Casey what little brains you have left with your hair.
blame judges, press, Hilary, "illegals" but never blame Russia?
Thank you for representing the majority of Americans and your constituents in PA!
Anyone not thinking Trump is racist can see this restriction makes sense. Your hypocrisy will haunt you.
hmmm constant attacks on our President are ok? Do you see what's going on around you? Are you awake? Hypocrisy at its core.
I genuinely think he's clinically not right. Impeachment is only option
well trumps right. The law is clear on this. The first attack, the blood of the victims is on the judge and Democratic party
What falsehoods or insinuations? He's right, illegals are pouring in. We need strong borders. Have you forgotten 9/11? I can't!
I agree. He is a big bully if things don't go his way. He brings sadness to that sit
They will stop only when he is out of office. And, Bob, don't just talk and complain, you're a Senator! #DOSomethingDAMMIT
#impeachTrumpnow
We believe D.T. unstable; does not have the ability to stop himself. Literally, out of control. Relying on the 25th amendment.
he's entirely correct, and his ban was also within his influence of power and legal. So wtf are you crying about?
Thank you Senator.
Honestly trump is a danger to our country.
it is frightening and disgusting.
when I saw this tweet, first thought is what's he planning. Scary that it was my first thought.
NOW you're outraged? This is what he has been doing all along- all of the GOP competition, Hillary, EVERYTHING
He has to go.
thank you for pointing out his reprehensible behavior!
#impeach
@Sashworks_com @SenBobCasey Trump & Putin communicate w/each other w/o recording in WH, what are the chances of them creating an incident?
Trump says if something happens, blame the judge. Far more relevant 2 look at Trump&Putin if something happened!
Please work with your fellow Senators to remove Bannon and Trump from the White House. They represent a danger to our country.
@ElizabethElliot POTUS is CORRECT! Remember all of the blame on Bush not dotting I's and crossing T's?
Casey, shut up about it!
Trump has gone beyond "alternative facts" & landed head first in an alternative reality. He is frightening people unnecessarily
it's only about him.  That's why he needs evaluation for Narcsacistic Personality Disorder. Never had real Physical or Taxes
Please help save us from this unhinged individual.
I think that line you mentioned yesterday has just been crossed.
what can we do to STOP THIS INSANITY?
It ALL needs to stop.  We are approaching a constitutional crisis. He needs to be led out of the WH in hand cuffs.

are these impeachable issues.  Please say yes
be vigilant, he's desperate, & likely to planing some event to validate his stance! He's dangerous!
He knows very well that nobody will be pouring in unless they are qualified to do so
thank you for speaking up!
Dems and liberal left coast judges are putting us all at risk,worry more about immigrants than us,why do they hate Americans?
Now you and the rest of the world know that @realDonaldTrump is a dangerously ignorant, reckless man #TrumpNotFitToServe
#ResistTrump & #ImpeachTrump
Trump, by fundamentally attacking the separation of powers, has violated his oath to defend the Constitution.
impeach the axum. He has crossed the line bigly.
So is President Trump's. I didn't see any of that from Obama with his workplace violence narrative.
#Trump #POTUS @SenBobCasey + @akamrt That's what you get from the so-called President of the United States of America, @realDonaldTrump  :(
what about the comment made Obama made about the police acted stupidly. Their mission is to serve and to protect......
He set precedent in his public campaign against Judge Curiel in Trump U lawsuit. He thinks gov't = exec branch only!
@KatCapps nothing has changed except fear mongering. #fire_the_fool
But they won't. IMPEACH NOW
and then Pence would be president. No matter what happens to Trump, HRC won't be prez, snowflake.
You are a fool and a disgrace to America.
Blocked
Then push for his impeachment please. #ImpeachTrump
@TuesdaysToomey thank you, Senator Casey. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump A matter of respect,respect for the institutions,which keep our democracy strong,&undermining is treasonous.
.. and our judicial system is one of the prongs of our system of our democracy, which protects our lives&hopes
So POTUS isn't allowed to disagree with a judge and his ruling? So judges can't be criticized? We'll remember that for Gorsuch.
Not an attack. Constitution is for US Citizens how  judge in right mind claims executive  order is unconstitional. Bob?
Impeach!! He's a danger to our country.
This statement is completely beyond the pale, IMO. He's basically put a target on that judge's back. He needs to GO!!
@realDonaldTrump I agree. Now do something about it!!
thanks Bob...Glad you are finally speaking out on something! You should remember Trump won PA
He needs to be relieved of his duties.
@realDonaldTrump maybe you could suggest he sign up for an online civics class. It's obvious he has no clue
@prezthentonow Trump can't stop. His brain is damaged. He has to BE stopped. Stop him.
stop him. Demand a psych eval. He is sick.
then get on it now! You were elected to take action #TheResistance
not my Senator
Impeach Insane @realDonaldTrump #unfit #traitor
DO SOMETHING.  DO SOMETHING.  DO SOMETHING.
thank you for standing up Senator Casey 
thank you!
hey Bob, might be a good time to talk to the folks across the aisle! America is being hijacked!!
keep up the fight! Trump is going to destroy our country!!
you had nothing to say when the Great Obama did it to the Supreme Court did you?
what are you talking about fake news again?
it's terrifying that we've elected an egomaniac that tweets insults toward the branch of government checking his authority.
he needs to go. He's a disgrace to our country. When a terror attack happens- it will be on him. #UnfitToLead
forefathers rolling over in there graves! bet they would never have guessed America would elect an orange puppet w/ tiny hands!
Thank you, Senator Casey!
he's creating a scapegoat for the next attack which will happen as he continues to ignore briefings.

He is our biggest threat.
Telling the truth does not equate to an attack. He had NO constitutional authority to do what he did, and u goons KNOW it.
He absolutely did!
His reasonings were absolutely NOT based in the Constitution. Would u like to bet on that?
This Republican appointed judge did what he was put on the bench to do.  Proud of him!
So he was put on the bench to over reach his authority and power? Non citizens do NOT have Connstitutional Rights.
Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Article 4. It's time! #UnfitToLead

Is this enough to start Impeachment proceedings? This is unconscionable to attack a federal judge.
high crimes and misdemeanors sweetheart. All he's done is try to keep us safe.
@gavinsblog We get it, Donald. We get it.
Thank you for being the #grownupintheroom! Please #StopPresidentBannon from undermining the safety and security of our country
too many big words, Trump will never understand what you are trying to say
what are you and your colleagues going to do about him? Talk is cheap. Show us some action!
it is a child throwing a temper tantrum because he didn't get his own way.  #disgraceful
@realDonaldTrump you simply hate the fact that President Trump is speaking the truth
.@SenBobCasey So what will you DO? TELL US YOUR ACTION PLAN.
Then listen to the people & move to #impeach him. This is ridiculous & irresponsible.
Senators can't vote to impeach, that's the house of reps job & the Republicans gerrymandered the house so badly
that even though dems got more votes, Rs have 24 more seats.  We can't impeach w/out a simple majority
well get your counterparts need to get their heads out of their asses
Thank you.  Please wake up @SenToomey He doesn't seem to get the point unfortunately.
So did you take this stance when Obama went after the SCOTUS?
HE IS CORRECT!!! You are backing the wrong horse!
, thank you for speaking up.
