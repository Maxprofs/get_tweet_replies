@jimmyj48125 @SenateMajLdr Keep up the work. Stall delay. Whatever. Only thing we can do right now against fascism
@23SkadooSt @SenateMajLdr thank you.
@DSenFloor GOP seems to be invoking every slimy maneuver available to push&shove its ill-qualified people through
thank u senator at least we have 1 senator in Pa who worries abt kids @SenToomey
Support the teachers union screw the kids. People afraid of options are corrupt and self interested.
You voted yes on many of the others. I'm not happy about that.
Thank you!
u WOULD've had support on this decision if u and ur party hadn't obstructed every1 for political games. Work 4 us
Thank you, Senator.
It's awful that GOP  would try this.  Thank you for being there to vote no so that we can have full vote
Thank you for standing up for what PA citizens want & not what big money wants, unlike @SenToomey who ignores us.
vote no  @SenToomey.  We are watching.  You're offices and emails are flooded
wrong vote. Time for u to go. Can't think for urself have to go along with the rest of the morons. Gone in 2018
thank you!!!!!
thank you for being accessible and for standing up for public education and voting NO for DeVos!!
I'm hopeful you were able to sway your PA colleague to do the same. I've been calling, emailing and tweeting him
@mcall @SenateMajLdr and I will vote no to @SenBobCasey come time for reelection!
Any chance you got Toomey to vote no? Or will he vote to hire the person who gave $55,000 to his reelection?
thank you
Thank you @SenBobCasey the @SenateMajLdr @DSenFloor are operating like the 1984 Balt. Colts who snuck out of town in the mid of the night
Thank you Senator!!!
this move has sewn up the #House going backs to @DNC in 2018. Thanks Mitch!
DON'T BACK DOWN DEVOS IS A DISASTER FOR KIDS
Thank you, Senator Casey!
@mcall @SenateMajLdr Working to defeat you. Worthless.
@PADems @SenateMajLdr. What a Sin!  Pay to play politics at its finest
Thanks Sen Casey you're the man! Can you tell @SenToomey his mailbox is full? And ask if he got all our faxes.
@painter_nancy @DSenFloor Thank you.

Lead the rebellion Senator. Need more public minded leaders like you , not those who think of themselves & $ 1st
and ever parent in America is awake and watching. Do the right thing for our kids! #VoteNoDevos
Thank you!
@PADems @SenateMajLdr @DSenFloor senator call for impeach Don he is the con cover up in Wh  very evil man@
Thank you! Parents across the country want competent leadership in Ed. DeVos is unqualified. #VoteNoDevos
Hood Bob McConnell is now welded at the hip of Trump! He will go down in history for supporting a fascist!
NOT DEMOCRACY
Thank you, Sir.
Will your boy @SenToomey grow a set of balls ? Or cave in to his #PayToPlay sweetheart! #noDevos
no...he proved he has no backbone early with keeping us in suspense over DJT support
at 7 in the morning?!
don't stop fighting the fight!
Thank you! #VoteNoDevos
Don't stop the debate. Don't let them vote.
unfortunately, Toomey will most definitely be voting in favor of DeVos. He's in Trump's tiny hands.
