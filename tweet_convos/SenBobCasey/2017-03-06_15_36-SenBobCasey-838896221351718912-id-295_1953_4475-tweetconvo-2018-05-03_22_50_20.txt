House Republicans release long-awaited plan to repeal and replace Obamacare http://wapo.st/2lxCvBW 
This would mean cuts for seniors, those with disabilities and those with low incomes. Hell no, I won't go along with it.
The GOP are playing with people's lives and these cuts will have real consequences for Pennsylvanians.
Medicaid is vital for seniors, those with disabilities and low incomes and the GOP are selling snake oil as a viable replacement.
Most seniors have Medicare which they are forced to pay for. Horrible plan. Medicaid is free for all the wrong people. Facts
Thank you Senator Casey
Tell Paul Ryan to REPEAL & REPLACE Congressional Healthcare Coverage to match what he is proposing for the American people!!!
why specifically is it a disgrace
Thank you Senator
@SenSchumer  shitty Obama care cost me 250$ a month and had more bills than when I paid cash
Without ACA I couldn't afford insurance.
i see you can afford a dogI work 50 hrs a week and I don't get assistance  I am the working poor
Your state didn't take the expansion. Sucks to be you.
I don't want the government's help I'm not a career welfare loser that's what's wrong
They are the same toilet content
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn Demand Ryan and McConnel hold a nationally televised presser with questions make sure it's on all networks
it wont be on all metworks.  Liberals will only let as much coverage as they can twist
do you care for Americans enough to actually post the bill for us or do just want us to take your word for it?
thank you#good man#gets it
Stay on it Senator,  we need you!
your first fight ever
This comment by @jasoninthehouse is a disgrace. 
Wow. My "extra" funds go to medication & groceries.  Once again shame on
@jasoninthehouse @GOP #Republicans

@SenSchumer. This plan is a total lie. They are taking away care from the ones that need it.
unfortunately make money at any price, the American way I'm afraid, people don't matter.
@ArgusC It's A Disgusting Plan and @Repubs will pay 4 This Action!
specifics?
@SenSchumer The GOP Never had a health care bill in place for 8yrs they just spoke against Obama's with no counter. Frauds!
are you paying attention or just regurgitating liberalese?
LOOK AT THE FACTS BOB... MEDICAID PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE WILL BANKRUPT AMERICA!  CHECK IT OUT!

Thank you sir. Tell ur cohorts that they do the same if they want to remain in office please.
Fight it with WHAT? WHAT will you replace it with? STAND for something? How's about MEDICARE FOR ALL?
Thank you Senator Casey!
Thank you! Just a Democrat from #Michigan
@SenSchumer Do it!
hold Rx and health insurance companies responsible, they cannot cause ppl to pay more than a percentage of their AGI!!!! #idea
until single payer system is feasible, advocate for things that measure a person's health OOP resp against their AGI.
please do. It seems to short change the most in need people. Shame on our government for working against it's own people.
we're behind you  1000%
.@SenBobCasey @nawlinsred2010 GOP health plan = #TrumpCare
GOPonly interested in tearing PBOlegacy down regarding ACA they donot careabout the poor middle class Athis is what u elected
Thank you, we are with you!
thank you!!
can you get @SenToomey on your side?
you don't have the Senate, you should fight for your seat, remember 2010 in the house?
@PaulBegala - so you're talking about #Trumpcare
@SenSchumer nothing is worst than Obamacare. You know it but just don't want to admit it
MAWD participants in the Pittsburgh area are already being given the boot.
@joncoopertweets #The real reason Republicans don't want to repeal ACA.
Golks it's s smoke screen  he just adjusted Obamacare a little bit it's still Obamacare who does he think he is fooling not us!
we can do better than this. ObamaCare has to go. The bickering over the replace package must end. We were right.
Medicaid is a big hurt on the Commonwealth's budget. I don't considered ObamaCare ppl under Medicaid "covered."..
thank you.  It is nice to hear a sane person in the cacophony of madness
I am depending on your values and service Mr Senator... Thanks
Thank you!
What's your solution? ACA that Dems forced on us is unraveling - so you stand by n gripe? Why not do your job n fix your mess?
What world do you inhabit? WE CAN'T AFFORD YOU, LIBTARD!!
Any specific examples?
you need to read it before you comment!
Thank you! Just spoke with @RepRyanCostello's office asking to do the same on behalf of families with special needs children.
@SenSchumer @SenBobCasey are you both using the healthcare exchange?
thank YOU for your Voice Senator 
thank you. Please keep fighting!
stay strong keep fighting   Thank you, from a PA nurse.
thank you. I'm glad at least one of PA's senators is sensible and compassionate.
Yes! Let us know what we can do to help you fight.
America is tired of paying for entitlements. And just who is getting them????
It is a disgrace.The idea of tax vouchers is a slam in the face to people who don't have the income to pay that amount in taxes
@ElizabethWarren  perhaps having Ted Kennedy's speech could be shared, his booming voice at a rally would inspire others.
@SenSchumer Helped Pedophile Tanveer Hussain #sick #resist
thank you.. we need more people in congress like you!!
@iamfonda You have lost so many fights recently  I can't count that high!
GOP plan: MAKE AMERICA *GRAVES* AGAIN 

Thank you
We are with you Bob. If Medicaid expansion is too popular to kick people off now why end it in 4 years. Tax cut for the 0.1%...
Thank you, sir.
@joshtpm Thank you Senator!
@SenSchumer Why???
@joshtpm Thank you. Our lives depend on it.
@SenSchumer another Dem lie
Thank you for everything you do.  Please run for President!
Please call it #republicare so we can attribute blame directly.  They need to go down with this ship
it's actually not too bad definitely not as bad as initially thought. I called Medicaid and asked to speak to a rep
the rep told me that if the bill were passed today Medicaid would have coverage guaranteed thru 2017 for all consumers
funding can't be infinite we need to get that. Apply early and get off when u no longer need it
if jobs are created mr senator then people won't need Medicaid as much as they need it now let's just b honest here
I'm a young college student I rely on Medicaid for ailments very much. I was very worried bout this but it's not so bad
I remember right before Obamacare I couldn't even get Medicaid because of age restrictions I had to be under 19
so trumps new bill doesent reset the age restrictions that's actually the main obstacle for ppl that OC itself cured 
now the replacement isn't perfect. But it is an improvement. Middle class ppl seem happy w/ it. That was the other deal the fee
@SenSchumer HELP STOP THIS #TrumpCare not acceptable. #SaveACA Can't cut taxes for wealthy by cutting healthcare for anyone.
About time you did something ?

#dumptrump
Or is @SenToomey too busy handing out #candy to care about the health of people in his state and in the US?
please do. Help us
@GeorgeM51741419 Thank-you.
@BarbaraRacek Yay Bob!!!   @SenToomey @SpeakerRyan @POTUS @CNN @MSNBC @maddow
sir. Thank you for your insight into what it takes to have an insurance plan for all Americans. We support your out rage!

Thank you, Senator. Just reading how they are gutting everything & are creating death panels for disabled & elderly is scary.
thank you on behalf of the American worker's and those who would like jobs, as well as those with disabilities. #Swampcare
You're doing good work, Senator. Keep fighting.
@SenSchumer  Obamcare Imploded. Doctors are not accepting Medicaid in many towns because the Dems won't pay the docs LIARS
As a CEO of a company exactly what is your experience with medicaid to feel the right to call several Senators LIARS? Share!
THANK YOU SEN CASEY! YOU HAVE US BEHIND YOU 100%
please fight this awful crippling decision by GOP
thank you for your support. It's ridiculous
@SenSchumer Stop being baffled by their lies. They serve money, Russia, and their own cleptomaniacal interests.  #TrumpRussia
@SenSchumer @BroaderVoices FYI Q loud mouth big spenders. Interest on National Debt goes to 4% how much of *tax revenue to pay?
*** Answer all of it! Entire tax revenue would go to interest. Stop screwing my family. Fact can't
have everything. No more raises on your limit. Learn how to deal with as good as we can. It's not a
perfect world and not everyone wins all the time. It's going to end you can't borrow 50% budget year
Thank you. I'm alive because of the ACA.
- GOP knows thousands will die preventable deaths. Premeditated murder. Crimes against humanity.
Thank you Senator Casey!
@SenSchumer 
Gosh, @SpeakerRyan, all of your weaseling tactics and STILL 
GOP can't trick us.
Better Way...pfft!
Thank you. We Pennsylvanians have your back. Tell us what you need.
please do
Why? Because if you can't steal my money to buy votes to keep you in power then you might actually have to work for a living?
@SenSchumer what else wold one expect from these seditionists. They must 'resist'. Truth is irrelevant.
fight fiercely Senator
YOUR A DISGRACE! Do you people ever go out and as us, the people what we want?
thank you!
@joshtpm Please convince your craven colleagues across the aisle!
the Trump can't care less Act-TCCLA
@joshtpm In the 21st century, @GOP health plan is just plain human savagery
Spell it out Senator. Loudly. Don't let insurance companies & their properties  (ryan & mcconnel) get away with double talk
The fact that healthcare is even a partisan issue is appalling and you clowns need to stop the bickering and fix it now.
We're counting on you!
you've got nothing,especially after 2018,term limits
Thank you for standing up for those who can't. Please continue to resist.
@PaulBegala it is a flaming pile of poop, or  . That is what they came up with after 6 years, Sad.
MEDICAID IS A DISGRACE TO OUR NATION. NEVER ANYWHERE IN OUR CONSTITUTION DOES IT SAY TO PAY EVERYONE'S BILLS. NO WHERE.
because she made 28 dollars extra 787 was how much she could make she made 801 on SS
@PaulBegala Thank you.
Your Obama care killed my mother
Try to leave a little gas in the tank for defunding Planned Parenthood, please.
Thank you! Please keep fighting for us!
Obamacare is disgraceful!  Dems lied and relied on the "stupidity of the voters"
Thank you.
Thank you, as a physician & on behalf of all my patients who will all lose with this sham of HC proposal by GOP.
it's the Care Less Plan! We get less care, and the GOP couldn't care less. #dontbecareless
thank you Senator!
What happens to seniors and others who need Medicaid if the go into a nursing home? Bankruptcy?
@joshtpm thank you
thank you for standing up for us Senator!
@SenSchumer @washingtonpost Keep it up Bob!
I AGREE! Their are unforseen circumstances in LIFE.
You going to cry again? T_T
Yes, do this, please. #SaveACA 15126
Thank you,  Senator
@SenSchumer guess it's a real good thing that y'all got nothin'
Thank you Senator.
@mayread3  Thank goodness, sir. Stand your ground!
it's unethical and immoral not to provide healthcare to people who have limited or no access.
Thank you! I am a single mom, college degree, working poor, have a handicapped son in Medicaid exp state. Will lose healthcare.
Thank you, Senator. We need your help!
thank you from 19020
.@SenBobCasey ObamaCare is not Medicaid
Thank you! I don't like the part if you lose your job you lose your insurance & have to pay more when you get another job!
@SenSchumer How about an amendment requiring U.S. legislators to use the new plan, exclusively?
Thank you, Senator.
This may be the last chance of the GOP' to the White House if they don't protect the future of Americans now they're in power.
better eat your Wheaties
@SEIU THANK U SEN CASEY!!
@SenSchumer ACA was A-OK though?
@SenSchumer Thank you Senators.
I find it hilarious when u give facts and not distortions and get called a "bot" and get blocked. REAL MATURE. Can't hndl truth
Thank You Sir
Behind you 100%. So proud that you're my senator.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for doing the morally imperative thing Senator Casey! #resist
thank you Senator! This is not political issue but an American issue!
maybe you should vote for it to see what's in it. Did u not say that when the ACA was passed? afraid this program wld b better?
thank you gentleman.  You are doing great work for lwr and midd income who struggle.
I'm with you
@SenSchumer term limits!!
The elderly & disabled may not be able to speak out so Thank you Senator Casey for protecting the vulnerable in our society.
To tie healthcare to tax credits won't help at all as under $25K/yr don't pay taxes. Poor srs/disabled won't be able to pay.
I think @senschumer is a disgrace to our nation.
@SenSchumer American citizens should NOT have to pay for Donald Trump or his children's medical insurance!
You are insanely misinformed.
@SenSchumer please do. We're with you. ~PA Voter
isn't Medicare the one covering seniors? And was the ACA "supposed" to replace Medicaid? At least that was the lie America got.
All part of ACA now. Until GOP ENDS IT.
@SenSchumer wish you had the same passion about retiring !
@SenSchumer @washingtonpost All 3 in this tweet lied about #ObamaCare and now want you to believe them about its replacement
@SenSchumer please do fight. GOP is out of control! This is horrible. The republicans are destroying this broken country.
@SenSchumer Let's rephrase, REPUBLICANS are a DISGRACE to our nation.
@SenSchumer Bob, Bob come on now its time for you to retire. Stop twisting things. Dems are going down in 2018! Lol
@SenSchumer  And what would u call Obama care? Pushed thru by Dems only. Peloton said we have to pas it to see what's in it.
@SenSchumer people will die bc of this. The casket business will boom while Dr's and Big Pharm collapse
Thank you for standing up for what is right.
Thank you Senator.  Repubs hate poor people that need help.   Why do they keep winning elections? I don't get it ever.
heard its a disaster, several times. By someone I trust.
@SenSchumer why don't you explain it instead of throwing your hate around without fully knowing
.@SenBobCasey You fight everything else, why would this be any different?  Democrats are all #obstructionists.
The disgraceful part is Dems would rather wait for the last insurer to pull out...then what?
@SenSchumer Thank you. Trump & Ryan want to destroy #ACA.
@SenSchumer Thank you from someone who will lose their coverage under the GOP plan. Also, why does the GOP hate ppl so much
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace to our nation. So, there's that...
