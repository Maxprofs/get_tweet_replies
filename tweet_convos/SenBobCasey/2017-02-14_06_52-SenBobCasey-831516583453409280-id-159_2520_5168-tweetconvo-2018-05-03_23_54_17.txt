The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?
  @Sam10k @realDonaldTrump
@pacollegedems The person that leaked National Intelligence information about #Flynn needs to be prosecuted. #tcot #pjnet
hey now... not cool... it's a Trump's Wedge Salad.
Or require everyone who vacations at Trump's resorts already have top secret security clearance. ROFL
Our potus lives part time in a gaudy hotel, and part time in a gaudy garish penthouse  smdh!
@mdyer56 Wait a minite...let me check facebook& see if there are any leaks on North Korea
Wait-are those CELL phone flashlights
I have no idea how members of MarALago had classified info on their phones & I am sure there were no spies there ;-)
so true!
Step one- get rid of Obama holdovers/traitors to our country.
please push for investigation. Our country is at great risk.
we are at great risk. From your ilk.
Are you saying Casey is a Russian collaborator like your Dear Leader & his hapless gang?
your on fire. Glad to see you fighting!
I love my senator throwing shade via wedge salad
@ProgressWeekly Wedge salad is so  trump
is dc swamp monster next time he tells truth will be the first
It was the greatest wedge salad ever. You've never seen a wedge salad as beautiful as this one. So crisp, so much bacon.
@BrianStack153
Sick burn, dude.
Maybe the Republicans should have chosen their candidate from "Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?" instead of the Apprentice
@ckarmi Hope those waiters are extremely vetted, for goodness sake!
Oh, they're the best waiters! Absolutely. So good, best waiters anywhere.
Everyone knows that Trump likes word salad with Russian dressing.
your snark game is on point. Thank you and keep it up!
nicely done Senator.
He was showing off for his Mar-a-Lago pals. BMOC
Amen to that, Senator.  Amen to that!!  #Resist #TheResistance #NotMyPresident
trump is a traitor to the United States
Nice.  Oh, and he should lose the unsecured (hacked?) cell phone he was using to illuminate the documents.
I gotta agree with you on that point. Take it to a secure room or table it until later.
@ShawnACoe StepTwo: try not to insult CIA and DOJ they r the ones listening on the other end of your phone
whoa. 1 step at a time. He's not Einstein here.
Better yet, you Democrats and blind followers stop interfering with POTUS and admin, support them and do the job!
@realDonaldTrump Diverting as usual. When cornered they bring out the shiny keys and shake them
Squirrel!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you! Fight like hell for us!
@mlalli01 just another Senator who wasn't there and has no idea what was discussed there. Typical Washington
Shaaaade! And so legit!
@laxgirl016 His hypocrisy is truly staggering.
this would be funny if it weren't true 
@TheRichWilkins want to learn our nation's secrets? Become a waiter at Mar-a-Lago

Are you also laughing at the lunacy? It's time to get serious about the lack of security. Our Nation is at risk.
@ParisNeully 'Cause ya never know who might be in the salt shaker.
@Takahata101 rekt, best senator from my state
so you knew about Flynn and didn't do anything Shame on you and thank you media!
@rm1268 and stop selling access to you & Mr Football to arbs for $200 000.
'There's no fool like an old fool' adage is so true with #Trump.
guy needs to be impeached!  Not my prez.   Nothing but lies from the guy's mouth.  Shameful.  The rest of the world is laughing
so tired of Trump blaming others.  Poor Spicer,  speaking for a total lier.
Go get 'em, sir.
-a constituent
I wish Congress would hold him accountable for this & other issues. I have no faith in @gop though. @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Too many leftover left leaning liberals still in Govt positions. And Democrats don't care about spilling America's secrets
@realDonaldTrump The leaks are clearly coming from the WH.
Amen Sir! Well said!
@Jury @realDonaldTrump câ€™mon Bob. Does it look like So-called President Cheeto eats a lot of salads?
Special prosecutor, please!  Page. Manafort. Flynn  all cut loose b/c of Russia ties. You MUST look at the boss.
it really is simple thanks senator Casey you're the best!
I love you more and more each day. Happy Valentine's Day!!
@RoyalBlueTrue Step 2: Stop having wealthy friends take selfies with guy holding Americas nuclear response.
If only we could clone you! Hats off to being a voice of reason, Senator Casey!!
The library is open! Good read, sir! #makeamericafierceagain
Traitors.
There exist traitors in at least one branch of government.
Say it: Traitors.
Any attempt to block Trump-Russia.
I agree with you Senator Casey. This president has no clue
yesssssssssssss.  Exactly.
@realDonaldTrump RESIST PERSIST IMPEACH #45notmypresident #StopPresidentBannon
@azalben Well you should know #Scrotus @POTUS
(@SenBobCasey)
Gets it.  Not sure if you tweet yourself or if you hired staff to do it,  but whoever tweets your stuff is good at twitter.
step 2: send back the wedge salad.  Total baller move
Considering leaks can probably account for his margin of victory in the election, why is he complaining now?
indeed.  If a Dem had done that, McConnell and co. would be screaming- only the sounds of silence instead
@maudglib 
Yesss! and The Real Problem is Paul Manfort,General Flynn,Russia's Hacking&Trumps Taxes. Investigate, Investigate & Investigate
you bad for pa.
The wedge salad mention is a nice touch.
@AustinSonger Serious Bunch of MOE-RONS!!
Whoa, now. Baby steps. To go with Trump's baby hands.
step 2: Don't be an incompetent Russian mole and antagonize the people that can prove it.
really shows incompetence doesn't it. Scary
@realDonaldTrump BOOM. roasted.
why are key CNC systems in public photos? This is an invite for some one to try to take them. Risk is now high.

The issue is that most of the leaks are coming from the White House.
Yeah! Don't let up
We are depending on you!
oh snap, Taking some lessons from @daylinleach ?
@azalben  thsnks for showing your true colors Dumass
Also try avoiding using your cell phone to light classified documents. Biggest source of leaks is POTUS incompetence
how do we know his guests are not foreign operatives?

It was in a private room Idiot!
@hotelkeys blaming the snitches is the behavior of a mafia boss
Step two. Move to Russa.
@AbeSylvia
better yet fire everyone hired from 2008 to 2017. Taxpayers can use the savings
.@SenBobCasey First reality TV show presidency. Trump loves to be cent of attn. Sees nothing wrong w/what happened in FL. #TREASONOUS
Your petty attacks on @POTUS are deeply troubling. #DoYourJob and cut out the whining.
Maybe if 45 would stop tweeting and paid attention to security briefings his own staff would take him seriously.
THANK YOU for stepping up your stance and representing your constituents!!! We love what you're doing!!!
I realize this is new territory, but can't you do more as US Senators to prevent this stupidity than tweet back at the man?

especially with those "foreign" servers who have not gone through "extremel vetting."
I never discuss North Korea with anything but a Cobb Salad.
@realDonaldTrump why don't you worry about the leaks in DC
DC is evil. This is where my tax go? No wonder Trump won. STOP LEAKING
Seems pretty obvious!!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you!! A simple solution I hope the President implements! #CommonSense
or on an unsecured server huh Senator? Clown.
Indeed with membership onlooker's who could have heard something that was classified!


Let him know the Chinese have hacked him on behalf of the Dems. He will understand that sort of thing is reasonable #Flynnghazi
In fairness, everyone in that room had paid $200000 to be involved in presidential decision-making. #valueformoney
thank you.
my thoughts exactly
b/c we all know senate democrats are all security risks
Bobby , please stop being so relevant and PC!! .. we know all is Dem talking points
the question is should the WH have security clearance? Is the President being blackmailed? Independent investigation
Also, he needs to stay in WH. Taxpayers already tired of paying for three residences WH, Mar-a-lago and Trump Tower. Ridiculous
It's the IC and you know it. They are broadcasting it. Broadcasting they are withholding important intel from President.
Because the president is compromised and will spill that info to Putin. They should keep it from him.
Oh I love you for this one comment!
DO YOUR JOB.  FULLY INVESTIGATE T.D. APPOINT SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS!!
maybe they could go to one of those secret pizza parlors old Michael "Lock her Up" Flynn is always whining about!
Please hold this administration accountable.
Independent commission w/subpoena power (a la 9-11) mandatory now! Flynn is a thread...pull on it and the cloth will unravel.
Ignore Trump's talking points, speak your truth.
bob! The GOP is worried about leaks! Not the treasonous actions of Flynn trump pence! Investigate them! Pressure them! Fight!
I love you.
I think I love Senator Casey. Happy Valentine's Day, sir.
He needs it.Scranton Bob the woodchuck senator hasn't been feelin the love as he loses time and again viz Trump
please senator, call for an investigation!
When do the hearings start Senator??
If true, I agree completely.  But other leaks from inside the White House are troubling as well.  #saynotoobstruction #zip18640
no wedge salad while discussing missles...awesome advice    no crayons either Donnie
@FightTrumpUnite is it considered a leak in that case, or an open faucet?
It was a Gorgonzola salad with Caramelized Walnuts. Get the Menu straight, sir.
DON'T TALK ABOUT LEAKS. THAT'S MISDIRECTION. TALK ABOUT TRUMP/RUSSIAN COLLUSION. Come on, Bob, get on the ball!
You are on fire, Senator! Happy V-day and thanks for all your hard work on behalf of #realPA
