You believe faux news too like the other loons? @washingtonpost
I guess this news can't be true, it wasn't reported on @infowars.
Guessing that's how fake news is born, never guess leave that to dishonest politicians  @SenBobCasey @washingtonpost @infowars
didn't come up with this the CIA and FBI investigated this. But go ahead, stay in ur bubble
Since CIA & FBI disagree, ru going to keep "guessing" My "guess" is Martians did it @washingtonpost @infowars @SenBobCasey
FBI & CIA agree on #RussianHacking, just not on their end game, but let's go with martians so u can stay in the bubble.
Ur getting better at "guessing" ur at "controlled guesswork" stage now ... Russians are not only hackers in the world
Whatever, don't care about facts, just stay in your bubble.
WHAT A BUNCH OF *#&@&%   #FAKENEWS... SHE LOST, GET OVER IT!!!!
Was Trump's attack on Chuck Jones fake news too? He's the people Trump claimed to be representing.
I bet you voted for KILLARY?  YOU BELIEVE this BS?  LMAO.  YOU'RE BEING LIED TO! TRUMP WON! PERIOD!
you about stupid like the rest of the people that got Trumped
Can't do any worse than INMAN OBAMA! Commander in ISLAM!  MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
Oh you think so do you? Ok go ahead and believe in the dictator be my guess!

@faobobindc @washingtonpost there better be! This is the only way to stop the madness of Trump. If so he goes to jail for it!

.. There is evidence of Trump / Kremlin collusion.
I hope so! We as a country can know longer take this crap!
thank you from Pittsburgh!
@ElaineSowersby thank you senator
thank you sir,  Now please. before he takes office.
Is there a way to delay the Electoral College vote until investigations/review is complete?
As long as we review the primaries first
Big duh. Of course the Party favored Clinton. SHE's a lifelong Dem, fundraises for Dems. BS never helped any1.
not just favored. The DNC cheated multiple times in multiple ways. #DemExit
Thk you. This information not new. Election seriously compromised. Electoral College shd be postponed.
PS - while we're :reviewing", how about a look at Comey's blatant interference in the election as well?
Thank you for putting America 1st!
Accusations and hearsay are not EVIDENCE of anything.
A plurality of voters agree with you.
as long as we review the primaries first.
Party establishment favored the candidate who was a democrat. Shocked. Bernie supported HRC.
the rigged the election in multiple ways for a war profiteer.  #DemExit
so, essentially you voted for Trump?
nope Jill
LOL. So Trump.
nope Jill.  did you vote for the corporate war profiteer?
a full review takes years, don't bury the issue. You need to start today!
.. The communications between the Trump camp and the Kremlin are VERY revealing. #treason
@JadedCreative @washingtonpost YES!! WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING!!! THROW OUT ELECTION!!!
I don't think he's saying that, but he's on it!
He will be.. Forgive me for using my 
@LauraVanVleet @washingtonpost I'm siding with anyone who thinks we need a second look, while the Deplorable ones think it's ok
@MrJamesonNeat @washingtonpost Why haven't we heard from @SpeakerRyan on this? We cant have our country attacked like this?
Thank you for your investigation
Senator:THANK YOU for putting yourself out there in support of Congressional investigation. Please stand up 4us
Thank you now talk to your coworkers
@DrKC4 @washingtonpost don't forget to review what was actually in the emails or we will think you're biased?!
Bring a Republican with you please. Needs to be both parties.
@polyman71 @washingtonpost 
Only way2find truth is Cong investigation.Bc only 
narrative comes fm Obi's agencies,not truth
No matter how you get there the truth is still the truth. @DNCWIKILEAKS @wikileaks @Project_Veritas
@Patrickesque @washingtonpost When will McConnell's link to cocaine shipment be investigated?
What about pushing for a new National Election
Thank you! We cannot inaugurate a POTUS chosen by Putin rather than the American people!
Trump will take office, that is not the point of the investigation
@WonderWoman934 @washingtonpost NOW!
I live in PA. If Dems do not step up against this horror I will never vote Dem again #notmypresident
Do the review, but do your JOB on Jan.6th & defend us against "all enemies,  FOREIGN and domestic". Do THIS:
thank you
Don't go away for Christmas. We need you and all Democrats out on TV to fight this.
Good!
thank you!
Russians able to focus effect of leaks on important swing states while avoiding NY and California. genius.
You and the silent democrats need to do more than"support"congressional review You need to find your spines.@washingtonpost
I'm "very concerned" about the occupation of the USA by #Putinspuppet New election.
Will mark you down as "un-American" @SenBobCasey Sad. @washingtonpost
Thank you Senator
@trcfwtt @washingtonpost So, have you been off the planet for the last few months?  Welcome back to earth.
concerned enough to #dosomething
You & me, both!
@LisaMoraitis1 @washingtonpost Thank you Senator Casey.
@MattMurph24 @washingtonpost then do it. Subpoena Trump,Tillerson, Bannon,Comey & rest of cabinet emails.GoodenoughforHillary.

@Senator Bob Casey please investigate the Russian hacking of our Election & FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS .
We're you concerned at all with the content of Hillarys emails?
whatever happened to server in Trump Tower that was connected directly to Russian Bank? Seized or destroyed?
thank you, Senator!
oligarchs and Putin can't get their way with sanctions & policy thru T. #crimeofthecentury
Thank you for supporting a full congressional review
Thank you, Senator.
thank you!
thank you sir!
Thank you sir!
Happy to see you fighting so much, being so vocal.
.@SenBobCasey, a @washingtonpost op-ed for yr Twitter followers who read: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/12/10/lets-get-the-facts-right-on-foreign-involvement-in-our-elections/ â€¦
Thank you, @SenBobCasey. Important we know the scope of this before inauguration, and not inaugurate if Trump is implicated. @washingtonpost
No story is more important than this one. #LiarinChief can not take office. He is not legitimate
I hope the review will take place before 12/19. Electoral College must not vote until this has been fully investigated.
We are all concerned Senator. Up to you Senators to reject anyone with a whiff of Russia on them
Sen Casey, please be part of this. I fear that PEOTUS is a "Siberian Candidate."
if Russia effected our election, we need a re- do.  Trump should not be President without a clean election.
WHERE is the GOP? They seem to be MIA on this. As citizens, we are terrified and feel helpless! Any advice?
Thank-you for your service in protecting our democracy in such a time as this!
@ealight461 @washingtonpost The time to contact the Electors is NOW. Donald Trump is unfit and unqualified to be President
THANK YOU Senator.
Thank you, Senator!!
@1arupprec Thank you,  Senator Casey. We cannot let this go! #RussianHackers #stoptrump PA voter here, ty!
Thank you, so I guess you're not still in the running for SecState, lol.
@kindnessNow16 @washingtonpost #resist
Please Senator Casey - DO SOMETHING this is still #America.
, Thank you,Sen Casey.
@RadioFreeTom @washingtonpost Bob, did you give a damn when one party rigged their primary? The US MSM actively campaigned?
@RadioFreeTom @washingtonpost sure Bob. But did you care when videos proved Dems were committing voter fraud? Staging violence?
get what they know out now, EC in 8 days. Even if means giving "sources", Putin will get that 1/21 anyway.
@AndthenIsleep @washingtonpost It's a sham and a shame for the @GOP if the @CIA report rings true. Grow the #HamiltonElectors.
Where does @SenToomey stand? Will he speak up?
@summerbrennan @washingtonpost Respect.
@summerbrennan @washingtonpost Need2 envision, sppt more thn invest: rad solution will b needed. If EC flips, GOP will overturn
@summerbrennan @washingtonpost thank you!
But are you ready to call a revote for a corrupt election stop Trump taking office before one?
Time to #LockUpMitch #LockUpComey #LockUpTrump for being Traitor 2 #USA .  Make Hillary The President
If Russia hacked voted, horrible cyber-security is another @BarackObama failure to his legacy.
C'mon, @SenBobCasey , you're smarter than that. I expect better of you. @washingtonpost #FakeNews
Thank you Senator Casey! PA loves you!
Support and INSIST upon it. Our democracy hangs in the balance, this is imperative.
.@SenBobCasey @washingtonpost #FakeNews #MSMfakeNews Where's @CIA Evidence? LOL! With those #WMD in Iraq? WaPo NOT Credible #TrumpTrain
@ALCassady Thank you Senator Casey!
@Sunnysgrl62 @washingtonpost what are you going to do to make sure it happens?  This is an assault on our country.
@laureldavilacpa @washingtonpost Thank you! At your earliest convenience please! Before Dec. 19?
Whoever "hacked" emails>not the point. Content incriminates Clinton/DNC. Glad you keep the emails in limelight! @washingtonpost
Some of the worst emails demonstrate Hillary's bloodlust for wars ... the world dodged a HUGE bullet @washingtonpost
.@SenBobCasey @washingtonpost Hillary IS Hitler,focus her war crimes indictment. Millions suffer her crimes against humanity! @IntlCrimCourt
.@SenBobCasey @washingtonpost @IntlCrimCourt 
@JulianAssange_:"We can say that the Russian govt is NOT the source"

@SheilaNJ @washingtonpost Excellent! Please, get started immediately!
@IowaJudo @washingtonpost thank you can we do full review before dec 19?
@emigre80 @washingtonpost I love this country and as such support a full congressional review
Thank you.  Electors should also have the report.
Same report, 2 different narratives from the WaPo. 

Why is that?
Thank you, Senator. Please do everything in your power to make sure this happens.
Dear Sen C, thankyou, we 2 want a  review.Please also block nomination. We want democratic process 2 prevail.
I'm guessing you're a democrat. Let me know if any of your Republican counterparts get behind this. @washingtonpost
@ericlewis0 @washingtonpost Thank you Senator

@SupermanHotMale @washingtonpost Thank you, sir, can you get more to join you?

Finally, an intelligent tweet attached to the hashtag.
Please fight this as hard as you can. Things are spiraling out of control quickly. Trump needs to be stopped ASAP. Insanity.
@thegarance @washingtonpost Senator,u guys have no balls to push anything that helps this country.When u say support not demand
@JMCFRAVA @washingtonpost I'm quite certain we need MORE senators D & R saying same. Even now you must ringing your colleagues!
thank you!
@bannerite @washingtonpost you are my Senator..this is beyond being concerned..PLEASE, PLEASE do something to stop Trump
What is your stance on Trump ascending to presidency w/this dark cloud hanging over legitimacy of the process.
FYI
Thank you @SenBobCasey  we need your leadership and that of others who will defend our country. @RadioFreeTom
And after the "full review"? Make another committee, perhaps?
On Jan 20, Trump will control world's largest nuclear arsenal - what will stop him from using it as a distraction from this?
@RadioFreeTom @washingtonpost As a republican, I also support Sen. Casey for re-elect. Need resistance to Trump.
the election was compromised, the results should voided!
@Smith83K @washingtonpost what does your Co R senator feel? Or is he for Russia?
@juliawb @washingtonpost 
@Smith83K @washingtonpost Those who don't support it are part of it.
If possible , we need a new election.
Release the October 2016 report.  NOW
Please investigate please help America
Thank you,  Senator.   I read Malcolm Nances book before the election and it was an eye opener! If you get a chance please read
@KansasLib @washingtonpost President Elect says move on..Mussolini said same thing..
Thank you, Senator Casey, from PA.
@girlsreallyrule @washingtonpost Thank you!
let's check voter legitimacy.. citizenship and registry too.. see how it all goes down then. Fucking hypocrisy
this is bullshit.. Russia did not hack our election.. come one. Common sense.
Also concerned with McConnell refusing to tell Americans. Threatening then wife gets cabinet. #Traitor
Concerned? I'm outraged. We're counting on you
investigations out  wahzoo, trump requested Or aided Russian interference in election integrity. GOP forfeit
#fauxoutrage our gov't has always been a few elitist playing monopoly with our lives& no party is innocent
thank you. This should shock and concern ALL Americans. Glad you are fighting for us.
.@SenBobCasey @washingtonpost The review needs to be immediate, demonstrating sense of urgency which citizens do not see. Reconvene Congress
@hillmanjudy1 @washingtonpost Get busy we don't want to hear anymore lip service. We The People want answers.
You are vulneralbe in 2018. It will be a joy to watch you go down in flames. #RussianHackers will make sure of it!
the results of the election. This #RussianHackers will throw them over the edge.
Stop being idiots! Conspiracy theorists and trying to scare already WIMPY idiots! who already fell apart after
Trump a racist,didn't work.Trump a rapist,didn't work.Recount in 3 states,didn't work. Now Russian hackers.... #shelost #moveon
Oh great I see Pennslvania can get rid of you in 2018. Who is your opponent? I will send him campaign money. #RussianHackers
those who would be doing the review are the same people who are the crooks and liars needing review..aka, the GOP
Thank you, Senator
Congressional review is not going to happen. The GOP needs all the time to clean up Obama's mess. @washingtonpost is #FakeNews
You got caught sleeping, now you wake up? Geez
YES!! Thank you Senator!! Proud to have you represent us!!
Trump is going to help Putin rebuild Russia to Superpower status. #MakeRussiaGreatAgain
@bannerite @SenBobCasey @washingtonpost exactly as they planned
I'm very concerned that you're this uninformed. https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/ â€¦
hey senator Casey..how about growing a pair? We are getting taken over to be turned into a Russian suburb!!
And what are you and the rest of the @TheDemocrats going to do? Just say it or actually fight to get it done?
Welcome aboard @SenBobCasey! Better late than never. Now do something to stop the train wreck.
very concerned?  Thats it?  And you are a D....sad.
I'll put your mind at ease... WaPo is a propaganda rag with less credibility than the Natl Enquirer these days.
As one of your constituents, thank you for speaking up; please continue to be as vocal as possible about this!
Thank you. I hope your colleague @SenToomey agrees!
Would also love to see some support from Senator Toomey on this.
the Russians did not hack the DNC the puppet master did...
I support your efforts as one of your constituents.
Thank you.
Don't just support it.  How about doing everything possible to make it happen.
tepid response 24hrs later...you sir get a "Participation Trophy".  Step up defend your country.
Thank you! It was looking like most elected officials were letting us down.
This McCarthyism is going to backfire, miserably. 

If you want a return to power,  -  GO BACK TO THE LEFT!!
WHY?? Because @HillaryClinton  Lost Russia didn't do that SHE did liar cheater and hating on we in Heartland
Dang man...where you guys been? Story posted online last night. Thanks for finally chiming in.
I have called your office since October asking for this. PLEASE keep the pressure on.
In case you missed it, Saddam has WMDs & don't ask us to investigate Saudi 9/11 funding.
