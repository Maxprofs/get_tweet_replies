JUST RELEASED: 32 million to lose coverage under Graham-Cassidy ACA repeal.

http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2017/sep/potential-effects-of-graham-cassidy …
Heard you speak yesterday at Temple when I was leaving work. Great! Let's keep fighting. This is too important!
And one reason why the GOP is
Fake news. All states will get medicaid expansion money something Obama couldn't do. No tax cuts. You can have single payer in your state.
STOP TOOMEY!!!
How about trying to convince Sen.Pat(hectic) Toomey of that! I called but he just ignores!!
I got through on phone, but don't think he cares what constituents want
Try this:  it sends a formal letter via fax which has to be acknowledged AND counted
Already done and called directly! But TY 4 spreading the word!

#RunOutTheClock Vote (((NO))) on #GrahamCassidy ! Stop cuts to #Medicaid for millions of disabled Americans! #healthcare  #DisabilityRights
If this monster is slain, it should be remembered that an American politocal party tried THIS hard to harm us all.
If we forced all members of Congress to enroll in the replacement for #ObamaCare, would that make it better?
I am thankful at least one senator from PA has our best interest at heart and votes with conscience.
Would it be too much to ask @SenToomey for you to do the same? Actually represent the people of your state, instead of hold the party line
Thank you for listening and doing what is right for Pennsylvanians. I wish @SenToomey would do the same
Why is it every new bill is actually worse than the one before? Is the GOP incapable of learning?
So glad you are our sentient PA senator! Take Toomey to the woodshed!
Memories of Dems screaming millions would lose the roof over their heads if Slavery were abolished as @BoSnerdley says better than I.
Different issue different facts different time
I do like an assertive Angela. @BishopBarron so gets why. And yes we still love her. Really. Seriously.
There is always love. We can agree to disagree and still appreciate each other.
Oh yeah. You're great. And this is just Twitter.
Actually one of my best friends on Facebook is my ex-wife so there. ~lol~
Complete lie. You should be impeached for breaking your oath to the Constitution and the American people
Only est 12 million ON Obamadontcare so numbers don't work.
Vote for the wellbeing of the population: No to Graham-Cassidy.
Casey is a NO on this Trump death care bill. It's the knuckle draggers like Toomey and the GOP Koch addicts that are trying to kill us all.
Thank you. You are my only Senator who represents my interests.

@SenToomey  not so much.
Many people say that Toomey is a bought and sold mouth breather. That's just what they say...
Trump says GOP's health bill protects pre-existing conditions. Here's the truth
socialized medicine is failing. Look around the world
PA people: When I call my Senators and Representatives, I get right through! Is everyone calling? @WhatsPatUpTo @TuesdaysToomey
Haven't called yet.  Also may want to call your Senator's nearest field office
Let's remember!!!!!!
Dems: 435, GOP: 0, in the House. Done.

Thank you @SenBobCasey
And MORE of us who supposedly HAVE coverage can neither afford it or benefit from it due to the COST of health insurance under OBAMACARE!
Thank you for speaking the truth, Sen Casey! #ACASavesLives #SavetheACA
So? What are YOU doing to convince the fence sitting Republicans to vote against this bill & resist their colleagues' blandishments?
GOP= #GreedOnlyParty
Thanks for pushing on his, @SenBobCasey!
And somehow people believe this isn't as bad as when Obama said "If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor".  
If at first (and second) you don't succeed, toss more people off of their health care plans.
Let's call this bill, which will deny healthcare to millions of most vulnerable Americans, by what it will mean to them:
#SlowMotionGenocide
32 million reasons not to ever vote for Bob Casey

27 million uninsured now. 7 million took the penalty. As prices go up more will not have a choice and take the penalty.
If #GrahamCassidy and the rest of the #GOP aren't willing to 86 their personal healthcare for THIS, then why should ANYONE want it? #Losers
WE PAY a $10000 subsidy 4 their med cov.  In addition 2 $174000 salary, 67 paid holidays, unlimited sick leave + sweet retirement deal
Please vote Yes. If we continue to creep toward "Medicare for all" we in fact will have more stringent caps/rationing = socialized medicine
Awful 'representative' of the people. Washington doesn't understand how to do their job anymore #failure #badsenator #nobodywantsthis
The GOP never lies. They just don't tell the truth: more people can be covered under the latest healthcare bill-BUT fewer can afford it!
Thank you Senator Casey.   Do you have any influence over Toomey?
Americas population reasons to vote no
Oh is that all?come on you heartbastards,you can hurt more people than that
And we are supposed to believe you!!!
Call, call, call!!  Don't become fatigued or discouraged!  CALL!!!
@RepKevinCramer, @SenJohnHoeven @SenatorHeitkamp is this true? If so country over party people! Obamacare is bad but not this bad is it?
I know my senators, Durbin and Duckworth, will vote NO!
Senator Casey is a NO. It's @SenToomey from PA that has a black heart & blinders to 32 million people. #noGrahamCassidy


I hope you do!
If the @GOP passes the bill the #DOTARD in Chief will sign it! Even though Trump has no clue what he's signing.
I need to ramp up my involvement. Americans will die under graham Cassidy
Just a question.
Who cares about tens of millions of people as long as the wealthy get to be a little bit wealthier?
Thank you Senator.
Evil
Thank you.
Yes! @SenToomey,are you listening to REAL facts? Or are you determined to stick w/Trump's fake 'facts'?Choose wisely. PA voters do research.
Save lives by saving ACA #VoteNo
Vote No!
Horrible!
True. So true. 
But, sadly, it seems a win is worth more than a person.  Or 32 million persons.
Voting NO should be a no-brainer...Health Care should be for everyone!  Non-Partisan...WTF are they thinking?
We easily find money for bombs. However, no money for healthcare?  GC Bill is not healthcare, it’s a first step for tax cuts for the rich.
Current Plan Isn't working.  Half of our population may get coverage but they  go into huge debt from copays/deductibles, etc.
Of course ACA is not perfect but there are possible fixes.  The GrahamCassidy bill is NOT the fix
A healthy electorate can support a healthy economy. A sick one cannot. Vote no to the GOP rollback of benefits to deserving Americans.
They don't care about the citizens, they only care about their donations & PAC's #gopswampeople
Tell that to your PA colleague!
A fake news site. Just say CNN
Simple, direct, reasonable. Thank you.
1,066,000 in PA alone...
And their smiling about it!
Koch’s promise $400 mil to GOP for repeal of ACA.
@OwenColby wait isn't this much worse than before
Amend #GrahamCassidy to end gov't health insurance for all US legislators. Make GOP senators be in the same boat as many of us.
Thank you, from 15235.
Then Vote No! Save ACA then Implement Medicare For All! I’ll Gladly Pay a extra $7.77 a week in Medicare tax! @SenBobCasey @SenSanders @AP
We can't be afraid to call it what it is: Radical Republican Terrorism
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10210248647633617&id=1263177953 …  #CHDawareness
And @ChuckGrassley can only think of 10 reasons to vote no.
Thank you @SenBobCasey now we need @SenToomey to stand up for PA healthcare as well!
Senator Casey if your office could contact major medical personnel and get a televised forum that could highlight all the reasons it is bad
It may help to make all aware of the true defects in this bill.
Call the GOPenis Senators!
You are one big reason to vote for it.
@TeresaFeldman2 @ASlavitt @commonwealthfnd and the most vunerable of all..disgusting
32 Million Americans will lose coverage. 202-224-3121 How do you kill a Zombie? Make your calls. Kill #ZombieTrumpCare NOW!
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz how many more do you need?  Vote no for Texans.
Thank you @SenBobCasey
Thank you!
Baloney...Casey read the article...it's all guess work ...so r u happy with Obamacare sen casey
We the people keep up the pressure and beat the vampires at the polls... Thank you Sen. Casey...
@SenBobCasey is awesome & he has been a true leader in this healthcare fight since the beginning! He really cares! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
This plan is so GOP can get their payola from Koch Brothers and intimidate non trump states into supporting him not going to happen
Born in PA, live in CO. Heart attack and quad bypass survivor. Pre-existing condition to the max! I'm so screwed if it passes!
Passage of G-C bill is purely politics. Erase any policy passed under Pres Obama. #GOP won't care about fallout...until 2018 election.
So sad!If they pass it so many more will die as direct result :( What disgusting humans "leading" us/#GOP! #shameless #Trump #GrahamCassidy
If you care abt Healthcare read it share it call your Congress person
#BountyHunters Graham/Cassidy. Koch Bros gives GOP $400M for 2018 only if *ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes. Graham urgency.
in dollars and cents how much is 1/6 of the us economy worth
1 in every 10 people in this country lose healthcare. This is a cost reduction bill, not a healthcare bill.
Where is the order ? Amendments, discussion? CBO Score ?
We need you to fight this bill fo us.
My husband was never sick a day in his life. Then came 2017. First came the shingles, then a double bypass. You never know when...
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NO LONGER AN AMERICANA POLITICAL PARTY. IT’S VLADIMIR PUTIN’S COMMAND CENTRE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
How many working people lost their healthcare when Obamacare went into affect

Stop the BS that ACA is great:   Illinois: 16 to 37 percent increase next year for the lowest-priced plans
One thing that would make plan more palatable-Congress applies plan to all the Federal Govt, including themselves.Should not preclude them
No complete CBO report. Would you buy a car w/o knowing how much it cost? NO! VOTE NO! They only want a repeal at any cost!
Tesla?? On that one, you gotta kinda sorta believe in Elon...just sayin'...other than that...No, you do a test drive.
Thank you!
How many millions lost their coverage or jobs because of Obamacare?
Called #toomey again. Officially"he is still reviewing the bill" so can't give opinion on pre existing. What a disgusting response.
#save32mil

Thank you, sir. Keep fighting the good fight.  We are behind you

Kochs pledge 400 million to GOP if they repeal Obamacare.

400,000,000 / 32,000,000 lose insurance = $12.50…
Sen. Casey, PLEASE--hold your colleagues accountable! Continue to stand up for what is right. Defend American health care for ALL.
When you say "ALL" do you mean members of Congress too? I suppose they need healthcare too, right?
I'm OK with everyone in the whole wide world having adequate healthcare. In fact, I'd prefer it.
Amen! Indeed. Same here my friend.
Please continue the NO vote!!!  NO on Cassidy-Graham!!!
Please vote NO
http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/whats-new-gop-health-care-bill-one-simple-chart/ …

Every American should see this chart.
how many voluntarily?  don't distort the facts!!!  ACA forces people into something they don't want
Don't tell us, Senator. Scream it in Pat Toomey's face.
Thanks Senator Casey for being such a staunch supporter of your constituents and our healthcare.
Cassidy said working ppl cant afford ACA. what a lie. I know ppl from all walks of life happy w it. The happiest ones are surprised Rs
This bill is not about healthcare. It is about GOP wanting transfer burden from federal govt. KOCH brothers want this yes he contributes G C
? Andy, what impact will this have on Health industry jobs?
,AAP Statement Opposing Graham-Cassidy Health Care Proposal
https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/GrahamCassidy.aspx …
He lies and u folks suck it up. Welfare people free health..gov employees can afford. So it's us whom get screwed paying for all.
Uhhh, according to the Obama care numbers, 24 million have coverage. So Bobby, care to 'splain where the other 8 million suddenly came from?
32 million reasons not to vote for incumbent @TheDemocrats who support endless $ for wars, but can't support #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
Some of us have done all we could called tweeted e mailed its out of our hands. Do the Rep really think we don't know why they are doing ...
Are you talking about those getting it for free or for those of us that actually pay for it?
Senator, please try to talk some sense into Sen. Toomey. I can't believe we are represented by such polar opposites.
Much like Ohio with Brown and Portman.
And how many exactly are being EFFECTIVELY covered under the #ACA??
Go get 'em Bob.  Kill this KILLER bill.
Prove that we will lose that many.
No rhetoric Bob.
Prove It
Thank you

@SenToomey @SenJohnMcCain @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @timkaine @SenWarren @SenFeinstein @SenGillibrand @SenFranken #WeMatter
As you should know, the GOP has controlled the house and senate since 2011. Look at the rise in debt since then. 
Theft of healthcare @JohnMcCain will be allowed to finish his cancer treatment, no caps now, but we won't.
But hey let's not address the elephant in the room that Casey won't tell you. THERE IS NO PWR GRANTED IN THE CONSTITUTION TO DO THIS.
It took Justice Roberts to call it a TAX to even keep the ACA alive when it went to court. A TAX created in the SENATE where it can't begin.
@ASlavitt @commonwealthfnd I have a question Bob....is your nose growing? My Mom asked me that wen she knew I was fibbing. 
What program run by the gov't has ever been on time, on budget and provided you a great product?  NONE....
Why would you want the same ppl who run the VA, The postal service, and the DMV to run your health INSURANCE program?
thank you for standing up for those millions Sen. Casey. What about you @SenToomey ?

Only reason no one wants to see the ACA go away is because they are getting kicked from the teet of Uncle Sugar.
That would be cool if true. But it's not. Just another mindless drone spewing ignorance
So somehow these guys evaluated the effects of this bill on each of the 50 states... Ppl with INTELLIGENCE know the CBO is garbage...
Might as well go down 2 local tarot card reader. Likely 2 get an equally correct guess on what things will do. Horribly wrong on ACA.
thanks for propagating a false impression - the 32 million estimate is at 2026 and only if Congress does nothing until then
Senator, on our current course we will be Greece in 5 years, and then the gov't wont be able to fund anything.
Thats the Dem plan, Dudley. Crush the U.S. economy so we all have to depend on Govt for everything.
Great job this morning on @CNN @NewDay
Please encourage all to vote no! Thank you!
If you care about healthcare you should join other dem senators in supporting Medicare for all. Your donors preventing you?
Why do they want a $6,000 deductible and $117/month for healthcare.  She works as a cashier for Shell
Won't make a difference to your heartless counterpart in the Senate @SenToomey who will vote for it anyway.
32 Million Americans will lose coverage. 202-224-3121 How do you kill a Zombie? Make your calls. Kill #ZombieTrumpCare NOW!
Wow.  Stunning.
Politicians such as yourself damaged healthcare with Ocare. Let it fail, then  keep your dirty hands off healthcare!
While you're off whining about this, PA credit rating takes a downgrade because you aren't doing your job HERE!! Get us a budget!
you do nothing to fix this just obstruction and confusing the issues,you need to go in 2018
@LindseyGrahamSC How do you explain this away?!!!
In the simplest way possible. You deny it and say anyone who repeats the truth is a liar
Until now I have tried to respect others beliefs, religious and political. Christians that back this bill are admitting their religion is BS
Healthcare is not a right sweetie, it's a service you pay for. Like when you fix your car. Religion has nothing to do with it. Get a clue.
