you mean Ms DeVos will undermine your campaign cash cow from the UFT when Charter Schools come. They're going over great in NYC
Thank you Senator Casey.

#StopDeVos  #StopPresidentBannom

dems turning public schools into public baby sitting
@educatorsresist Hold the floor
The parents of "those" kids think you are slap wrong.
Keep it up, Democrats. Get DeVos gone.
I live in Pa and can't wait to vote you out.  #SchoolChoice
Government monopoly schools and teachers' unions use red tape to abuse students
Teacher masturbates in class
that's what they r doing now kid r more ignorant then ever before liberal agenda Islam teachings
Thank you Senator for standing up for what is right. You make PA and all of us proud. We know who is on our side
it's all about the unions

Everyone is education MUST read this to see what is in store. CNP is central to this administration http://www.cfnp.org/file/ERR-CNP-Site.pdf â€¦
#goBob!  #PAStrong 
I disagree, Ms. DeVos has been a champion for education for many years.
Keep up the good work!!
can't wait to vote you out. #draintheswamp

Devos is a person to fear more than the new Hitler - Trump himself. I feel we have seen the last of public schools
THANK YOU, Senator. your leadership and dedication to our schools, children and future is vastly appreciated!
sorry his dedication is to the Union's not the children
@educatorsresist Thank you for speaking for us, Senator! #DumpDevos #noDevos #RejectDeVos

@dollyllamaX There is bound to be someonne better than she is,
From a PA resident, 17522, thank you for your NO on Betsy DeVos
Based on what information?
Thank you Senator Casey!!
Dems must have a lower dependant class to stay in power by giving entitlements,have no reason to break up edu union monopoly
: thank them every one.
want to keep people poor and stupid so he can have power
Go! Go! Go!  Thank you, Senator Casey!
Obstructionist Dems are powerless. DeVos is the most qualified. Bye bye teachers unions
Thanks for not supporting her nomination!
thank you, Senator.
Yes!!!! Thank you!
If people want to go to a public school they can go but to force kids to go to schools that are high in crime etc is pathetic
pA ranked 23rd in public education but it is Betsy devos' fault? What did you do last eight years to help?
she is for school choice what the heck is wrong with that. Why do we have to monopolize schools w gov interjection
Thank you! I wish @SenToomey would understand.  #VoteNoDevos #USKidsDeserveBetter

@SenateGOP @SenateDems Education is the foundation of our economy and our national security.  You must reject @BetsyDeVos
Thank you for hearing our voice, Sen Casey! @SenToomey has let the people of PA down. Keep the fight going! #VoteNoDevos
Well said 
tell that to @SenToomey
HOW TRUE! She is so unqualified. Hey @SenToomey take notice
At least one of #Pennsylvania's senators are doing right by PA's #teachers, #students, and families. @SenToomey should, too!
She is exactly what the students. She is someone who works for kids not unions.
Thank you senator! Please don't give up. @SenToomey could learn a lot from you. We know who stands for PA. #noDevos
thank you for standing up for students and for parents of students. #DeVosvote
