Let's go pens!!!!
1 to go!
Do it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Back to back Stanley Cup Champs.
@BillyDavisRacin @Jamesomac26  our pens one win away boys
Cheaters
Both teams have done great at home but horrible at away games.
Very true!
Oh my, is this the actual score in a Stanley Cup Final game?
Yes it was the actual score.  Just like game 3, 5-1 blowout.  It's been a crazy series with a few more surprises I'm sure.  Should be fun.
#PrincessCrosby
thanks this far for this crazy playoffs and finals, one more win for the repeat, and I have a pacemaker now
Missed PAT
Yes !!!
Conor and Jake are so young and so cute speaking to the media. I bet their parents are so proud. I know I would be.
Hainsey has more goals than Ovechkin in Cup Finals
Even if he were to retire after this year, Hainsey will always have more Stanley Cup goals (and Cups) than @ovi8
Still a Game 6 and or 7 to win
Yep but we draw closer with every win
As do the predators
That is true
Lol


Best smile ever today!!
Awesome
Yeah Baby!!
A good night to be watching comedy
15 down and 1 to go boys!!! Let's do that again on Sunday. Go @penguins  Go!! #WeWantTheCup #Repeat #StanleyCupFinal2017
@joshlabonte3417 it's easy
& That's how it's done - Way to go @penguins 
Man, I'm on cloud 9. Thank you Pens for an exciting game! Oh... baby!!

@CallMeMaloney @The_SportsPaige @ClayTravis crickets. Looks like press have no pekka

Hell yeah!!

What an amazing comeback!! #StanleyCupFinals
Smiling like a butchers dog!
Take this stuff to Nashville...it works
Go Pens!


Need more though!
can't stop smiling
Lol nice job paying the refs extra fora good game
Tell me again @PredsNHL how you had the Cup sewn up after only holding serve at home.  Winning in the burgh is another matter entirely #Pens
Two goalies=0 to 6
Thank You! Thank You!  #StanleyCup
Okay-caught me...a smile so big, yinz can see it from Space, apparently! 
Uhura! You're a Pens fan, too! Vive la Resistance!!!

Gosh those refs have scored 6 times!?


@AlexLanglois15 Champions
Going to 7 I hope! It's been a great series. Great game by the Penguins though!
I am crying i love life BUCKLE. UP.
No cup for Trashville!!! F  the preds
What do we do if we can't figure out what the fuck is happening?
Oh, God! Yes! I'm loving that result about the second period. #ImpactOnPop, #IMPACTIndia, #StanleyCup, #NSHvsPIT.
This team is incredible. What a message they are sending to their fans tonight!  We believe in you guys! #PITvsNSH  #StanleyCup

Can't stop yawning....
We need the P.A.T
AGAIN, I LOVE YOU
Like a butchers dog!
Come on fans at the game. Chant for 3rd period. "We have Class! We have Class!
THE BEST FEELING
If Sidney Crosby is Conor and Jake's dad, what does that make Matt Cullen? Uncle? Grandpa? I've always wondered this
Live look at the pens bench cause we are winning by 6 goals 
I love it.  This is just great
End of second. @penguins are leading 6-0 and Subban's breath is still shit. #NSHvsPIT #StanleyCupFinals #yesimstillmakingthatjoke
Retweet if you paid the referees to call asinine penalties.
#preds getting beaten harder than pks head by crosby #letsgopens
That's some great irony right there
WE WANT THE CUP!
Hey I need a signed hainsey puck ;) please
THOSE AMAZING PASSES!
The preds are playing the SC Champs you didn't think we would go down without a fight.  Well you are wrong.

RON FUCKING HAINSEY SCORED OF COURSE I AM!!
Penguin hockey at its best!!

Is Eddie Olczyk wearing a Preds jersey under that suit?
He's butt hurt that they sucked when he was coach...
