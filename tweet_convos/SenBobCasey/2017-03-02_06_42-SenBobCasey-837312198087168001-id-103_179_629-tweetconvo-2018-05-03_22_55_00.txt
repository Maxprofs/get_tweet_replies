... and let's not forget, Mr. Sessions is a lawyer. He knows how to answer (or not answer) a question. In fact, he volunteered his response.
why upset demo. A g lied about tarmac meeting billy clinton.
Sessions is a liar, he must resign.
#Sessions should resign. He lied under oath. #Trumprussia #ResignSessions
please withdraw senate confirmation of Jeff sessions.
He lied .. UNDER OATH! And he's now heading the Department of JUSTICE?!? This is beyond absurd. He must resign!
I guess it's OK for politicians to lie under oath and not commoners "lock him up" or is it only females
Recusal is not enough. He must resign.
no your just being an obstructionist that's all democrats have left so sad for you
Sessions lied under oath. He must resign.
Sources now indicating top Democrats & Republicans were aware of the surveillance of Trump Tower - Schumer, Ryan, McCain knew? did you know?
AG Sessions DID NOTHING WRONG  #altleft #Obamaleaks
Not necessary. Please accept the results of the election. You are placing our lives in jeopardy. Stop antics!
Sir, have you ever met with the Russians ?
An independent commission would be better.
AG sessions must resign and go to jail. He lied under oath.
Recusal done, but a full investigation into perjury charges must also happen #SessionsLied
So it's unreasonable for the Senate Armed Services Chair to meet with a foreign ambassador?
Then why in the world did you confirm Wilbur Ross' given his Russian connections?

Recuse? I'd like to see the language escalated. Sessions lied under oath. Pressure him to RESIGN.
Weird, I don't remember you asking Mr Holder or Ms Lynch to recuse themselves
I'll hop on the pile here calling for his resignation. I'm also curious if he should be disbarred.
Sessions should be investigated and charged
.@SenBobCasey Recusal isn't enough at this point - he lied under oath. He must resign.
Please tell Senator Casey that at (202) 224-6324
what would happen to me if I lied but I guess he is more important than me
Bobby maybe they can look at Senators for sale...
no! He should resign!
u got to go clown.  The end of January 2018 you won't b in office. Mr. Do-nothing sucking up our tax dollars.
I wish @SenToomey would follow your lead he don't care about real pa citizens Thanks for standing up for us much appreciated
Thank you. 18976
sessions should be fired immediately for lying to congress. Anyone else would.
You shd quit cowering to Dems lies & character assassination. Stand up & shut down lies against Sessions. You may be next
sesucker bob casey should recuse himself from the political arena because his criminal intent and treason .
The American people call on all Democrats to resign because of the conspiracy and coverup of corruption they do
Thank you!!  This should not be a partisan issue and he should step back immediately.
Thank you, Senator Casey. I was just about to call your office to ask.
if there's confirmation of presidential-Russian involvement in election results, is that impeachable?
.@SenBobCasey Recusal is not enough. This was perjury. And @TheJusticeDept can no longer be trusted under @jeffsessions command.
also look into the 30 Dems who met with Russian diplomats in 2015 help grease the skids for Obama's Iran deal.
While I support your calls for recusal and investigation, AG Session's resignation would be appropriate.
. @SenBobCasey @TheJusticeDept No, he needs to resign. He lied. #SessionsMustResign #SessionsLied
,@SenBobCasey @TheJusticeDept CORRECTION: AG must resign or you must remove him. Recusal is for conflicts of interest, not perjury/treason.
He needs to resign. He can't be trusted.
In real life one's likely fired for lying during job candidacy & you go to jail for #perjury. Lockup #Sessions!
Thank you for speaking out.
In what world would Repubs have not demanded the resignation of Obama's staff. Sessions needs to go and #45 be impeached.
recuse? We can and need to do better than this, Bob.
@PADems @TheJusticeDept Recusal is NOT ENOUGH. Sessions LIED UNDER OATH. He is unfit to serve as AG.
A President was impeached for less.
There is no recusing! He sld be charged with perjury & lose his position!!
@CruzWhobris @TheJusticeDept Not enough. Sessions must resign. He lied to Congress under oath. #resist
Perjury in testimony to congress; he needs to resign immediately.
so must Comey
recuse nothing. He must resign NOW
Recuse? He lied under oath. Resign is the correct word.
he must resign #sessionsmustgo
I just sent an email to Sen Toomey about this! Proud I voted for you!
recuse is not enough. He should resign AND be prosecuted for perjury as should Pruitt
AG Sessions should resign and be prosecuted for lying to a congressional committee.
Thank you Sen. Casey. What are your next steps to force accountability?
Go ahead with special counsel. You'll  root out Dem & Obama admin involvement which you'll find is deep-rooted!
include his resignation and we have a deal.
He should resign! He lied. How can anything he says be believed if he lied to the Senators questioning him.
he must be fired and prosecuted!
Can't wait until Casey is out in 2 years
.@SenBobCasey @TheJusticeDept Sessions must resign and be prosecuted for perjury.
resign!!!!!
Forget recusal. He lied under oath. He must RESIGN and face criminal charges.
@SenToomey He needs to resign and be prosecuted for perjury.
#TrumpRussia #FireSessions #Resistance
Lying under oath calls for resignation, possibly prosecution.
@TuesdaysToomey @TheJusticeDept Bob, Sessions should resign.
thank you Senator Casey! Please keep pushing to make this happen! #Sessions
Your defeat is taking shape, Your ideology died last November!!
@alyssakeiko @TheJusticeDept HE SHOULD RESIGN.
Yes, recuse, but still no 'there' there.  Spoke to RU ambassador as Senator, wasn't part of campaign. Stop!!
Thank you Senator. Next step: perjury charge and resignation! He doesn't deserve to be our AG.
As Session find the slush fund to fund left-wing activists. It was shake-down $ from Corporations
stupid propaganda investigate Obama's deal with Iran and ties to the Muslim Brotherhood instead
that's not nearly enough.  Sessions needs to resign today as he is unfit to serve as the head of @TheJusticeDept
For perjury?  Maybe step down as well? #GoldStarDad
resign and jail ..
no Casey, that's no longer enough, lied more than once to become Atty Gen. recusing himself is no longer enough
He should resign. Sally Yates was fired for upholding the Constitution.
No perjury charge? Why not?
Also, why a postcard image of the DOJ building?
and does that mean you all are OK with the top cop lying under oath? Please address that shit! No sidesteps.
After watching Schumer, I'll rescind my question. Kudos to the Dem leadership!
Thank you, my senator.
AG Sessions should resign.
