This bill will hold all future Presidents & VPs accountable by requiring they divest from conflicts of interest.
In order to #draintheswamp @realdonaldtrump must divest from his business.
The President should not have financial conflicts of interest, @realdonaldtrump must divest.
This bill will also prevent @realdonaldtrump from receiving payments from foreign govs through business holdings.
Bipartisan experts have called for @realdonaldtrump to remove conflicts of interest by divesting, this bill would make it mandatory.
Unless @realdonaldtrump divests from conflicts of interests, citizens will not be able to tell where @Trump Org ends and Trump Admin begins.
please work til this is passed, even after trump inevitably caves.
2008 me wants to scream "DICK CHENEY MADE MONEY ON THE IRAQ WAR" over and over again.
Thank you Senator
YES !!! THANK YOU !!!
with laws that will keep us free and safe.
YEAH... I'll back that when you congressmen do the same...and you tell me how ovomit's worth went to $17M...
great work, but I'm struggling to understand how this legislation didnt already exist.
perhaps previous presidents-elect didnt need to be told "it's literally illegal if you don't divest."
That, and previous Senates didn't signal that they were happy to overlook even the illegal stuff
i hadn't thought of that. good point.
GOOD JOB SIR
NOT YOU TRUMP BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME   ,,,NOTSOSAD,,,
@WILLDYE4U @realDonaldTrump I think you don't like him because u cannot continue to stay crooked
should release taxes if nothing to hide. He should prove he's not the crooked one.
when u ask Hillary to show33000 emails and donations she received as sec. Then u get
They call it 'PUBLIC SERVICE' not 'Self Service'. No one is to gain from being employed by our govt.
Good luck with that even if its passed Trump won't honor it
YES thank you!! The constitution doesn't mean anything unless the govn't upholds. Hope the @gop steps up too.
and I asked that as you gentlemen run this great Country, make laws that help People live Better lives.
Today is a good day, I pray to  the God of America that Jehovah will cause u gentlemen to have a great day.
the PIG needs to be impeached on day 1 if he is not in compliance !  BLIND TRUST NOTHING ELSE! crook
Can we expect that you will do the same?
Senators are already subject to Conflict of Interest laws and rules http://www.ethics.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/conflictsofinterest …
but Hillary Clinton was not as Secretary of State?
Clinton lost we r talking about the new president & what he's hiding in taxes. She released them
ask Putin
Because how can America help her Allies. If her children are going hungry and dying.
thank you, sir! You make me proud to be a Pennsylvanian.  #TheResistance
Thank you Sen Casey. #ResistPutinism
while I certainly agree and support your decision I can't belive this wasn't all required. @SenateDems
Prior Presidents voluntarily complied with ethics guidelines. Trump ignores them.
Just to be clear these hotel stays are examples of law breaking. #impeach
and may God bless you with wisdom and strength to take America into another next day. Make us safe.
Why was this action not taken before the Muslim in Chief took office?
great job!  We love that you will be a leader!
Thank you Senator. Anyone know where we can find a full list of sponsors?
Amen
have a good day. Remember you were elected by the people and for the people. Make it work.
Yes.. I am with you.
Are you also supporting term limits and insider trading rules for the Senate? @realDonaldTrump
Casey is a long-time supporter of insider-trading rules https://www.casey.senate.gov/newsroom/releases/casey-calls-on-senate-leaders-to-include-anti-public-corruption-measure-in-congressional-insider-trading-bill …
As for term limits, their value is very questionable. Most believe they end up making lobbyists 1/
the most powerful group, since they know system better than constant influx of new Senators 2/2

that's judge Judy!
Pictures are cute, but there's empirical research on this
My family has lobbyists in it. Trust me, term limits make their job much easier.
Help America, help Her keep her children free from bondage and laws that are to heavy to keep.
Oh yea that's going to pass like diarrhea through a baby!
Thank you for standing up for ethics and integrity. Divestment and a truly blind trust.
Thanks Senator, but do you have votes? Drastic times call for drastic measures. If you fail then what? #SitIn @SenBobCasey @PrincessBravato
Thank you, Senator!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP what's ur response? Certainly you would support such transparency for ALL inc nominees
He needs to release his taxes. He's proven himself to be a blatant liar so right now I trust nothing he says.
include all politicians in that law. we need to #draintheswamp
How about backing legislation to declare election #illegal? How much more scandal does it take? USA is a joke @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
@DidiFrench @realDonaldTrump congress should back legislation to force any presidential candidates to show 5 yrs tax returns
@JolieandElvis @realDonaldTrump How about those pesky TAXES?
@nypapajoe @realDonaldTrump With this, Russian interference & Russian connection with trump why is this person taking office

@robynslcsw @realDonaldTrump     Right on, Bob!!

I agree with this fully!!!
@ValuesCommon @realDonaldTrump thank you Senator.

Why don't you go play with the play dough represent the PA voters who voted in majority for President Trump
what about Jr and Ivanka who is going to stop them they are all involved with daddy warbucks.
does that include his family who he is surrounding himself with. They are still doing business as usual
@mms5048 @realDonaldTrump -Trump would rather resign than do that!

@marcyrw @realDonaldTrump Hopefully the @senategop understands that this is what the American people demand!
Thank you. Someone has to uphold the Constitution, and it won't be Comrade Trump.
Thank you for standing up. The president should be an examplar not dragged down by overwhelming conflicts.
Thank you senator. Keep up the good work.
I would prefer legislation that removed Donald Trump, but we'll take what we can get.
is there bipartisan support?
Thank you for standing up to @realDonaldTrump , we stand with you to oppose these improprieties no rank & file gov ee cld do
@Nebula63 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for doing your job. Hopefully your colleagues will step up as well. Best of luck.
Great! Thank you. Now see if you can get some GOP support. Tough sell as bi-partisan in this climate.  Go get 'em!

Thank you Bob
Talk to me when you have a veto proof bill/law, until then stop the BS.
