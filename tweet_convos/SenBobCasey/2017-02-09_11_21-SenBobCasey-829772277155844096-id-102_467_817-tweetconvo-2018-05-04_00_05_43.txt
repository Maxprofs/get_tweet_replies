I joined @CoryBooker to tell @realDonaldTrump not to take the eyes of the federal government off of violent white supremacist groups.
Targeting just one religion – Islam – for these programs is divisive and damaging, not productive. Hate crimes are already increasing.
We must remain vigilant against all violent extremist groups. The security of Americans must be our top priority.
Stop this weakening of civil rights!  These groups are against the Constitution and American values!
man quit with the lies already your group let in the real threat
One reason why I upped my small monthly donation to the SPLC from $10 to $15. They will be busy. Great Org!
Exactly!  The Bannon agenda is war and violence. He needs to go.
Of course not!  It does not fit the Bannon agenda
Are you kidding? Majority of Trump supporters, plain working class. Better watch those Amish, very dangerous!
I'm a LOT MORE than concerned; I'm afraid and I'm white, @SenBobCasey. Racism is still a real problem, @realDonaldTrump

I wonder what it will take for @SenToomey to be troubled by this administration too & care about Pennsylvania.
He does, it is Casey that only wants to play politics.
and reminding nazis that nazis/white supremacists are dangerous isn't "playing politics".
but by all means don't confirm it before you ramp up the rumor mill
@POTUS  we'll boycott Ivanka & 
shame her greedy fam. Trump needs electric shock treatment b4 incarceration
OMG How can it be stopped? Everything we want to know is gone left in place is you @realDonaldTrump A Tyrant
That IS troubling.  If @SenateGOP really want to protect USA they should be addressing all violent extremism.
How troubled are you?  Troubled enough to wake up and do something?
White supremacy groups have been responsible for crime, violence and terrorist acts and need to be monitored!
Hope that's not true.
Why would Trump target his own base?
yea! Because they have been doing a lot of terror killings lately!
trump is a criminal handing us all to Russia
Terror is terror. Trump obsession with Muslims leaves us vulnerable
,@SenBobCasey Ur ALWAYS a day late and a dollar short ~ WHINING doesn't do ANYTHING ~ Either STEP IT UP or GET OUT OF OUR WAY

#Resistance
don't be divisive. Only together is there any hope of slowing the March of Hatred. Late is better than never
this is always the way .@SenBobCasey approaches his job.
I'm not saying he's perfect and doesn't have room for improvement. I'd just rather have him with us than not
@dizzleone73 @realDonaldTrump Its not like any of you are going to get him out of office so must not really matter to any of U
@JJohnson2u especially since a white supremacist was just arrested in Georgia. He was playing around with ricin for some reason
Troubled maybe, but I hope not surprised.
. Thank you.
I'm much more worried about domestic terrorists.
@OlafWipper @realDonaldTrump is there any sensible explanation for this?
@Skamama01 @realDonaldTrump
what will you do about it?
We're far more than 'troubled'. Many POC, including Hispanic & Native have died at hands of white hate groups.
"Troubled" is the best you can do? Shame!
At this point I have moved past hoping he is just bumbling around. Things feel intentional. #womansintuition
UNACCEPTABLE
Gee Bob, you've got a million of em! When are you going to tell us about Trump eating our babies! U R a Dork!
as a PA lifer, I would rather exhume Hugh Scott and have him fill your seat.At least he would show up
president has too many friends in white supremacy organizations, and Bannon whispering in his ear.
Please support Sen Pascrell's request to Sen Brady to have treasury examine 10 years of Trump's tax returns
this is insanity. Fight, Sen. Casey. Fight like hell.
Will probably target EPA and real climate scientists!
So am I. tRump still hasn't mentioned the attack on Muslims by white nationalist in Canada last week.
I agree. That is very troubling
Keep the focus on the Trump administration's actions.
U know damn well,,,, that's Crap ! @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
Hello Senator - It isn't Islam or Muslums, it is Islamic TERRORISTS. Get it right Senator!!!!
It's a ban on persons from proven terrorist producing states where the facts of their identities cannot proven
AND it's a temporary ban until a proven vetting process can be defined.  Right now the UN chooses for US
of course not, that's a large part of his base.
Stop fooling around and get this fascist regime out of the White House. Do not come with a problem and no solution!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump ENOUGH! Breaking laws every day. #endorsements  #RUSSIA #Taxes #noblindtrust
as you should be!! Just caught one of Trumps supporters with riesin in his pick up..
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Extremism is Not an Issue of Race or Religion. 19026. #TheResistance #Indivisible #DividedEqualsZero #P2
this is not keeping America safe. It's putting them n danger. Ur violent rhetoric has already killed n Canada
Target as in ignore or just not at the top of the list? @realDonaldTrump
the white supremacist groups have killed more, are the much bigger threat.
@sheenA_8886 @realDonaldTrump do something about it!
First they have to admit the crimes those groups or their influence on others to do them.
You are promoting racism and should retract. It's troubling that you get nothing done. #Obstructionist
With all due respects Mr Casey, Im tired of hearing congress is troubled.. its time for ACTION.
@calicobayfarm @realDonaldTrump so "SAD"
Also, FBI investigating white supremacist infiltration of police forces. What happens now given today's Trump/Sessions EO?
When are Democrats going to grow a pair and stand up for what is right, instead of just suffering through it?
I'm studying PoliSci @ UMUC. Did Lit review on Dom Terror. Problem some don't want to face & wont go away.
how can that group NOT be violent & extreme? Because a racist is AG & @POTUS? No equality! @SenSchumer @cnn
Thank You Senator Casey for standing up to this man. We need ones like you Warren and Sanders IN this troubled time.
Are we going to continue like Republicans won like we did in 2000?
are we now convinced that this is hate-mongering bully?
Sentor, how long are Democrats going to legitimize this FRAUD being perpetrated on the American people?
there is no basis for these remarks other than stir up your base & riot. Clever you must be proud of yourself
are you really surprised given who is now in charge #smh #sad
Uumm, why would Trump, or his sycophants, target his base? #TrumpLiesMatter #sessionsdishonor #ResistTrump
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump They won't target them because they ARE a white supremacist group. Please stand against the kleptocracy, Sir.
What?
I call this a complete abrogation of the law in a manner so egregious that it undermines the basic principles of justice.
no kidding #2 on list.  He's letting them lose on the Muslims & Hispanics.
loose
what is this based upon?  I want facts, not "reports" of what "may be".
Troubled? What will you DO?
I appreciate your voice on this- but I'm asking seriously- is Congress going to do anything about any of this?
How did we go from "no drama Obama" to "shit goin down, everyday"?
White extremists have done so much damage!  Racism, sexism, homophobia.  It's what's for dinner @ Trump Tower
#PresidentBannon feels fine about it I'm sure
Absolutely. Casey wants to obfuscate & hide behind platitudes to win over ignorant electorate
what reports? Is this just fearmongering for sake of sensationalism? Provide source please. Yes, I'm PA voter.
Please elaborate. An informed electorate is a powerful electorate. Details please @SenBobCasey.
scary here in PA
Please do what you can to make sure that doesn't happen. White supremacists take lives too. Thx for your work!
proud of u..from fellow,HC alum
why would they. They're Trump/Bannon's allies
Steve Bannon........
utter bull and you know it
