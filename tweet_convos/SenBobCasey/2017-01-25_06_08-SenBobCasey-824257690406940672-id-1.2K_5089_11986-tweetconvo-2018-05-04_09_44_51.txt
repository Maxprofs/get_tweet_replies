even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!
Senator, it's a damn shame that we now have to wake up every day worried about what rights he'll take away next. It's insane. 
I'm certainly worried about this voter fraud nonsense leading to more voter suppression & DAPL, that's just sad
Look into what's called 'gerrymandering'. It's a Google away. Usually follows some fraud claim like this one.
An AL court just found that the use of gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Check that out. Will pass link if I can find it.
@FightingMad1 This is no longer evil rantings, but evis actions. Spending tax dollars on this is an astrocity!
time to stop paying federal taxes
I'm with you on that. CA sends a lot more $$ to DC than we get back in federal money / services. @sandio5o9 @SenBobCasey
imagine if all of CA refused to pay fed taxes. We could do serious damage. I'd rather give my $$ to CA.
imagine if Feds confiscate every pot shop,  farm and assoc bank accts if CA stops paying FedTax
Many CA lawyers are eager  4another go-around w/ the feds, so they can take it before SCOTUS and decriminalize in all states.
you are a good man. I want some demonstrations to come to Wilkes Barre, so I can join the Resistance!
Hey, @altKateLee , we are small but mighty! There's a rally happening in the square tomorrow at 1, we r trying to connect with others also
where and when?? You mean in Wilkes Barre??
yep! It's on the Wilkes Barre Square, starts at 1pm.
but good to meet you. Maybe we could get together for a cuppa on the square later this week?
so sorry to hear! Hope all is well. Direct message me and we can figure out when and where to meet up :)
thanks, will do
We all know that the Democrats don't want voter I'D BECAUSE it makes it harder for them to cheat. They aren't fooling anyone.
that is why they just knew Hillary would win, it didn't work this time thank goodness!
@realDonaldTrump nobody is suppressing LEGAL voting. I  asked 6 times a wk for photo ID. Voters should too
@JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Sen.Casey!  I'm from TX, so my complaints fall on deaf Republican ears.
@realDonaldTrump This is an obvious DOG WHISTLE! Trying to suppress POC. #Racist #Gerrymandering
is that how you won? Why fight so hard? #ridethetrumptrain #dontbeajerk
When well intended patriots disagree, that's democracy. When POTUS says it's not fact until he approves it, that's tyranny.
@EJLandwehr  It's the beginning of a lot of shit. FIGHT.
First, we should start calling #Crosscheck & #votersuppression what it is:  #VOTEFRAUD .
(Not voter fraud, but vote fraud.)
Begining of an effort? It's a continuation!
Get Started, Bob!
But without dead Muslim mexican hooker's abortions voting, whose going to build your tacky buildings and pee on you?
Thank you
What she said x 100000000
@joyannreid 
Because you want all those illegal votes Dems know they have lost the white vote so they pander to minorities
our news in hburg va said they're going after changing electoral vote in our area so he can get more votes sick what he's doing
@realDonaldTrump Casey hasn't fought for anything his whole time in office. Senator Zero. Zero legislation. Soon to be replaced
You know that's exactly what it is!
Independent Commission to investigate #CrossCheck or civil suits via E.Holder's new effort. Away from Congress so no sabotage
@Badander86 @realDonaldTrump maybe too little too late
Weak Dems did nothing for 8 years, now can't do anything but watch. Civil disobedience is the only way. Take out our financial participation
@MoMan60 @realDonaldTrump Restricting voter access is a GOP wet dream. Who would had guessed POTUS would be the lead advocate
Our right to vote is literally being thrown away.  Should be illegal that GOP can decide my vote with proper ID doesn't count.
The "voting procedures" are already too strengthened. Ridiculous the amount of ID, proof of residence to register, then vote.
if you want to help democracy survive, you must nullify @realDonaldTrump Kremlin-Infiltrated presidency. All else is fluff.
Publish how much "Investigation" will cost. Serves no purpose but Trump's vanity. Organize Congress not to pay for it.
@realDonaldTrump Vote NO on all lunatic Trumphs picks. If Dems won't fight back we will vote you out. #
We should turn this around on Trump, and use it to get better protection for our votes / more Americans registered!
I felt this would happen. The MAGA slogan would mean a step back to voter suppression aimed at minorities we must fight
any intelligent person knows this is exactly what the "fraud" bullshit is working towards
@neeratanden : Wow, does trump really believe many people have been dead for a long time ?!?!....
@msnbc @joyannreid PLEASE have @greg_palast on daily now that Fuhrer doubling down on his delusion w/ app VoteStand #CrossCheck
two words I'll clean it up our of respect for U but screw trump...he is one crazy SOB. We need more voter rights upheld.
Excellent!  You have our support!
