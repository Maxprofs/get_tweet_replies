Question: what evidence did the White House counsel's office use to clear Gen. Flynn of legal wrongdoing?
Question: Did @realDonaldTrump authorize General Flynn's conversations with Russia regarding sanctions?
Question: how long has General Flynn been in contact with Russian officials and did any of that contact predate the election?
These questions can only be answered by a thorough and independent investigation into the Trump Administration's contact with Russia.
Because he knew from day one
Trump believes that is Fake News. I don't. I don't Care for that Russian Spy Ship sitting off the East Coast.
You forget about the 15 US spy ships off Russa's coast?
I will be Honest I did not Know that. Loaded with weapons?
@I_Am_Here_Still @bannerite #Veterans Becauuussseee They Needed Time to Shred Evidence of TRUMP/Putin Collusion?
@Jgucciardo2 @realDonaldTrump Answer= because he is POTUS
Why did you think it was OK for Hillary to have secret information leaked to all via private server????
13 investigations of Hillary and still nothing.  You think there will be 13 investigations on this?
 PA thanks you!
When did then sitting president #bho act on #russia dnc #hacks Suspected  2015(?) @SenBobCasey @Sam10k   @realDonaldTrump
they are all in bed with putin follow the money and investigate. The writing is on Wall. GOP compliance
my question is why did democrats coverup the Clinton lies and is she not in jail
because he's a liar
I swear they stole this idea from House of Cards.  #pussyriot
@POTUS @KellyannePolls because they didn't think they'd get caught, duh!
good point! How did accusations of your pedophilia stay out of headline news?
is this like blaming bengahzi on a video?
BENGHAZI
Why did the Democrats IGNORE every single Obama WH scandal? Why not condemn ppl calling POTUS -Hitler?
wrong. Question is flynn was victim of felony crime. that gets  solved first. wh did nothing wrong.
Establishing damage control. The more time to do it, the more time to bury it.
Another question:  where is Manafort?
because they hadn't gotten caught.  Really not much of a riddle. 
@Jgucciardo2 @realDonaldTrump Think we need a investigation on these leaks first. Most dangerous thing to democracy I've seen.
release the taxes and the wall will crumble.
because Trump thinks like a Autocratic ruler.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump Why did they wait weeks to tell the VP??
@marycmccormack @realDonaldTrump Obviously it didn't matter until it was leaked. #TheSwampGrows
Survey says....
The bigger question is who leaked the wiretap, what was in it?
that's not the bigger question sandy. Jesus Christ, country over party. Get it together.
because they are complicit
They were busy getting stuff done while you wait around to read his tweets.
@DebraHange1 @realDonaldTrump He did he fired attorney that brought that to his attention and wouldn't support his muslim ban!!
Do you have an intelligent question instead of this political one?
Go for it! Impeach @realDonaldTrump!
um I believe it was immediately turned over for investigation.  Don't fudge the facts.
they hadn't been caught yet!
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump was awaiting instructions comrade.
The American people demand answers to these questions.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump because they were caught. Duh.
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump we need a full investigation.
Trump had no intention of firing Flynn. Flynn knows dirt on Trump. Patriots leaked to save US.
because President doesn't care what the people think. Look at taxes, comments on women, transperency. #resist
, He will probably wait longer for Conway.
Agreed Senator, please investigate! Your constituents have questions and deserve answers
#Indivisible #Resist
You have to sound abit tougher Senator. Take action. Follow through. Don't give an inch.
That's an easy one Bob: 45 can never admit that he is wrong, flawed or would misjudge.
What did he know and when did he know it?
Why did he lie to reporters that he hadn't heard anything about Flynn/FBI investigation, just the other day?
O another question Casey why didn't Obama raise SS tax base amt from $106k? Or keep SS Tax rate low @3.1%both?
My qwuestion is why didn't Prez OBAMA nor you senator show up to LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES 75th ya hate kids?
@kwn1170 @realDonaldTrump 
...because he's in on it. That's why. He didn't want to bring attention to himself.
@LosGIANTS @realDonaldTrump because Trump is deeply involved in everything..waterboard Flynn and he'll spill the beans!
I think it's absurd to believe Flynn acted independently of trump. Russia holds trump hostage. Demand taxes!
Nothing illegal
you lie trump you sent him there to tell them to calm down --u would be Putins boy if Russia played nicely
@dawnmichele @realDonaldTrump cause it got out. Only reason. Despicable.
exactly. They would have never admitted it. What else are they hiding?
And why is Flynn calling himself a Scapegoat????
Answer: Because he's hiding something!
Thanks for taking the lead on this Senator Casey. Glad you're my senator.
Well duh, because they know Flynn knows what Russian has on #Trump
The administration allowed Flynn access to National security information with no trust and confidence!
sounds to me like the Trump administration is a much bigger threat to our security than refugees.
Because Trump knew and now it will come out.
Thank you, Senator.
they didn't. White House counsel did an immediate investigation to see if anything illegal was done. After
they determined there was not a legal issue it became a trust matter. If someone says I want to give you a
heads up you do an investigation you don't just fire ppl! You're playing politics and I don't care for it.
if congress wants further hearings Trump admin will comply. Now it's up to them.
none of this makes sense. Please find the truth!
@Only4RM @realDonaldTrump you need to find out. Keep digging.
I assume you want American ppl to draw their own conclusions from these ???...Bc I'm sure you already know: Trump's compromised
These are excellent questions. We need answers.
Let's hope we get any answer to that question.
Because Trump told him!!!!! They got caught!! Only reason this is happening!!!
watch the WH press conference, give the man his cabinet, too late for credible democrats after Nancy & Chuck
By a vote of 23-15, Republicans just voted to not request President Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department.
Does seem strange that they'd wait several weeks for legal analysis if end Q was just "hmm, do I trust you."
have you noticed, senator, that this story @realDonaldTrump is telling makes no sense? @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
Better question. When will the democrats will be prosecuted by the DOJ?

the  were to BB troll
So important to get to the bottom of this.
None. This is not the White House, it is a country club.
We need to understand this.he knew Flynn was susceptible to blackmail and did nothing, he put our sec at risk.
kremlingate kremlingate
& why is @SpeakerRyan trying to deny the need for an investigation when the American People deserve the truth?
cause they are all in this mess together.
And how many weeks? Only been in office for 3!!
Nothing to hide? Release the transcripts & his taxes!
*cough* election *cough*
why did Dems take weeks to admit a video was not responsible for Benghazi? faux anger and concern, shame on u
If dems took too long, you should want this investigation ASAP, rt. Better than the dems, rt?
they blocked the investigation, which was why it took so long. Flynn lied, people didn't die
But now republican are blocking/wont investigate. People died in Yemen. No investigation.
They aren't blocking, Chaffetz also said there should be an investigation. Yemen is classified
good question impeachment hearings
