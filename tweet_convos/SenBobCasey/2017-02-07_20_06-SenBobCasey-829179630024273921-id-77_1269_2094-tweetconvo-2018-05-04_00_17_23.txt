@tullymox In all concerned seriousness, can anyone stop the tragedy occurring in our country? Frankly am petrified.
every single democratic senator should read this letter until you are all silenced.  that would send a message
Please read her letter in the Senate. Can @SenateMajLdr shut you all up? #letlizspeak #mlk
@realDonaldTrump u can shut up n sit down too. U do not represent PA residents
Can you get any GOP Senators to ABSTAIN from Sessions vote (that way they don't have to vote No - just ABSTAIN)
- senator, make PA proud - take the letter and pick up where @SenWarren left off
:well done
@barbaraJean1980 more supporters in Senate
Kudos to you Senator Casey...you have my utmost respect because you are not afraid to do the right thing.
Dear Sen Casey please join Sen Jim Merkley He read same letter was not in violation of senate rules
where were you on the prescription drug bill!? You can't pick and choose.  #$250,730FromPharma
not at the head of the class were you rebecca?
And you Serve on Fiscal Responsible, Under Obama How much Debt Was ADDED ?  HOW RESPONSIBLE Are YOU ? @ABC @CBS @NBC @FOX
shut her and other trash talking libs up. we are sick of this. look around you democrat party is burning down. @SenBobCasey
speak over them. At this point now it's the Dems who are "just following orders."
You make me proud to say I am from NEPA!
The @GOP is using misdated rules @ appropriate times 4 their own gain. Silencing a critic is an injustice to democratic process
you guys are listing to a few insane people in the party and calling it the base you lost your base over the last 8 years. @SenBobCasey
#LetPocahontasspeak #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
My hope is Warren would,be nominee in 2020#socialist

Thank you, Senator!
and have your children ever been in public schools??  NEVER!!  Give people a chance
@SenToomey Fight Fiercely Senator Casey. I don't think  toomey wanted to vote for Betsy DeVos but did because of contributions
when's it's the Dems time in 2 or 4 yrs, I hope to God you all remember the way these asses acted
Why don't you also publish the fact that the case in record was requested by BLACK voters and Def. ADMITTED breaking law
How does McConnell‘s dick move against @SenWarren ‘s right to speak not exactly underline that Sessions is a racist?
Why not publish Sen. Arlen Specter's remarks regarding Sessions? Your behavior in demeaning another Senator is DISGRACEFUL!
UR being rude&smear spirited BC U know it was a smear then&still is NOW. Shame on U,Sen.!
McConnell is the one who needs to be silenced.  Such has been the case since Bush led the nightmare.  He needs to go.
@LemieuxLGM the confirmation system is broken when the worst cabinet ever gets all confirmed. Rs may have killed the Republic
ironic given Strom Thurmond's overt racism.
Another good Tweet, Senator. Keep on it. Thank you.
prove it's a legit letter. Liberals have a history of falsifying documents. Warren even lied about heritage
Thank you for supporting that amazing Woman!
Thurmond apologized for this.
@siliconvalleyex Bob Casey is one of if not the biggest crook and liar in the Senate. If he's all u got, forget it.

You are the best senator we've ever had. Thank you!!!

As a constituent, thank you! 
Too bad @SenToomey won't stand up to Trump!
so you have zero regard for the rules?
thank you. Read it on the floor yourself and ask every Democratic colleague to do so too. This cannot stand.
.@mamagrainne @SenBobCasey

Senator, you represent our family from Pennsylvania. Please read CSK letter. We will never forget this Republican attack on Liz
Senator, I'm so proud you represent me and other Pennsylvanians. Thank you for fighting the good fight! #letlizspeak
Thank you, Senator.
Is it possible to get the letter entered into Cong record since Sen T "forgot " in 1986?
See if you can read it on the floor?  Maybe it is only bad if an uppity woman reads it.
did you really take money from big pharma?
shut her up and get her Ancestry DNA kit.
Is that what you do with your employees? 
do what to my employees?
Thank you for posting this and your support for #VoteNoDevos. It is appreciated from out of state. Shame on @SenToomey
