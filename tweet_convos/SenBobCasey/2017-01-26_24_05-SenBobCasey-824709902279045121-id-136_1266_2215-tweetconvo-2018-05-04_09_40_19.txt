@billy_penn 
We support you, Senator!!!! Keep pushing back for us!!
@esabbagauthor "terribly increasing"?
Bigly...

Idk Bob, you and fellow dems have done a great job at rolling over so far. Your words are hollow
@billy_penn Thank you for looking out for us! @SenToomey wants to throw Philly under the bus
How very Christian of you
TRUMP IS A LIER AND A RACIST MAN.
@SharonJ44257163 @realDonaldTrump @billy_penn he is still trying to spread hate and fear wake up see the similarities
Thank U for being 'truthful' &  defending Phila.  There is no such thing as alt-truth', there is only Truth or Lies :)
Dont let him keep lying. He's an embarrassment to our country. Please do all you can stop him.
.@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, here's an Inquirer story titled "Why is Philly's homicide rate going up?"
The Enquirer is Trump's fave..it's where he gets 'his 'facts'... along with recipes & fashion tips!
...Inquirer...as in the third oldest newspaper in the US...
Art...is got Philly Inquirier confused with Nat'l Inquirer. Honest mistake.
@billy_penn Thank you Senator Casey
Better talk to the Philadelphia PD first.  They report homicides up 37%! http://www.phillypolice.com/crime-maps-stats/ …
he will NEVER USE THE REAL FACTS.

Thank you for standing up to the president's blatant lies.
He says it and his followers believe it.  How do you break that connection?
Trumpo continues to lie- the only way he can try to make point - lie and people will listen.
@billy_penn thank you!
@billy_penn Thanks for holding up the truth, Senator.
@billy_penn American spies being arrested in Russia as we speak, did Flynn turn over the list to the Russians?
Thank you. And thank you for your work as my Senator here in PA.
So many Senators showing spines after the past few months is so refreshing.
#FakePresident #MakesShitUp #MentallyUnstable Trump is incapable of telling the truth.
He never lets the facts get in his way, Senator!
Thank you, Sen. Casey for fighting back.

@billy_penn thank you for standing up for us!
: he must be stopped. Please. It's up to you and your Democratic elected peers. This is NOT normal and it is not American
@billy_penn because when u schedule a "retreat" (i.e. peace & calm) u pick a slaughterhouse to do it in #fool
it's amazing how easily he lies.
@phillywerise

And neither will we...
RIGHT NOW: Huge protests outside Trump and GOP retreat in Philly #ProtectOurCare 
It sounded like you are going to vote for Price. If that is the case m, goodbye.
If you do not vote no on the rest of the nominations, you have failed and we will let you know in 2018.

no to every cabinet nomination
@billy_penn Senator Casey I stand with you

@billy_penn Thank you ! We want our political reps to hear our pleas! 
Each and every one of you.
@Roxy4080 @realDonaldTrump @billy_penn call it a lie until he stops lying. There is no other word for it. #TheResistance
Please call Chump a LIAR because he is one! #Resist!
Don't stop there! This man is maligning everyone/everything that isn't 'republican'.
@stgert @realDonaldTrump @billy_penn senator stop approving ANY of his nominees. Zero. Now.
@billy_penn trump is a mental Case
@billy_penn Casey.., your days are numbered. How's the budget working out for you? #slacker
Those r called #Trumpfacts. @potus = #DelusionalDonald or #LyingDonald
@billy_penn I would prefer an impeachment to start.... he's trying to be a dictator
@billy_penn thank you for standing up to the alternative fact Senator! He couldn't be more wrong! #lovephilly
@billy_penn He wants everyone to think every major city there is nothing but carnage &  he alone can fix it!
The fix? Ya...well...being "great again"...
@mlcreader @realDonaldTrump shows clear signs of Alzheimers dementia. Erratic temper ego repetitive speech patterns trances.
Don't you mean increasing, terribly? I thought a HS education was required to be president #alternativefacts
@PADems @realDonaldTrump ...... the voters of PA have spoken and they want Trump and his vision! Aren't you up for election?
How bout if u & my party gets itself together & not aid #TrumpPropaganda by referring to #LIES as AltFacts/falsehoods; ComeOn!
You should watch, he might blame you for the nation capital being moved from Philadelphia. #AlternativeHistory
Buying into his marketing terms hurts by giving it visibility that leads to its legitimacy. Lies, bullshit, are replacements
@marina282828 Trump's silly game is to act like all has gone wrong and sell us the falsehood that only he can fix it! Comical!
@billy_penn Why don't our leaders stand up and challenge this in real time?
thank you Senator for calling out the "President's" lies. And that's what they are, lies.
#alternativefactsarenotfacts  they are #LIES
yes, stand up to all this anti-democracy action and ask your colleagues to do the same! @billy_penn
@billy_penn @realDonaldTrump Senator call them what they are LIES
I'm glad, but he doesn't care. This fight is going to take unprecedented battling from you and your colleagues in Congress.
@billy_penn keep in mind, he is setting up "to send in feds". Watch out for that while u argue
We will welcome them, give them flowers & ask them what the fuck they're doing breaking the 10th amendment
@billy_penn did u see the crowd that was protesting? No fans in #Philly. Not in the whole #jawn town

Don't say "falsely maligns." Say LIE. They don't want political correctness. Don't give it to them. LIES!!!
We are With You!!
@billy_penn thank you Senator for standing up to our lying "President "
