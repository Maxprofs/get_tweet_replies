@Smileesalot @SenateGOP You mean you don't want the GOP to back room deals and tell public lies like the libs did with the ACA?

The problem is he's in until 2022.
Keep it up!  Thank you for fighting for us!  We need more politicians like you in office. #ShowUsTheBill
Withhold Consent to EVERYTHING until we can see it, debate it, and the CBO can score it!
Thank you 
THANKS Bob!  Disappointed GOP Senators are afraid of open discussion of their health care bill, or input from citizens, taxpayers, & voters.
Dear Senator Casey,
Thanks for fighting for your constituency. Unlike the other Senator from our great state. Godspeed
Senator casey voted for higher drug costs and was top 10 on the list from big pharma lobby money.  He's a snake.
Hmmm didn't seem you weren't applying this standard with Obama care! Remember you got to pass it before you see what's in it!
Go Bob!
You all tried and failed, now the other guys turn
Where were you when Obama rammed thru his bill? Such a double standard.
Thanks Senator. As a PA resident, I'm glad someone has some backbone left in their body to speak out. Elected officials need to work for us!
Do not relent!
thank you!!
thank you Senator Casey. @SenToomey you know jamming this bill through is wrong. Real PA is watching & won't forget
Thank you, Senator, for fighting for my child! #HoldTheFloor
Mine too!
#WITHHOLDCONSENT #FilibusterByAmendment
Are you crazy. Costs of Obama care are not affordable.
I bet you were not upset when the democrats passed obamacare when nobody was able to read it until they passed it
Your constituents thank you!!!
Thank you from a PA constituent!
Thank you @SenBobCasey ! @SenToomey PA deserves better than secret deliberations on how to take our healthcare & bankrupt state.
Nice job Senator Casey!!
Many of my patients will loose vision without insurance. Don't keep them in the dark. Open up the process - let in the light! #HoldTheFloor
We all know what the GOP healthcare bill is: "If you get sick just die quick" , because we need more war weapons & tax breaks for the rich.
Thank you!
Thank You #HoldTheFloor #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you, Senator. Give 'em heck! #WITHHOLDCONSENT #HoldTheFloor
Thank you, Senator Casey.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator! Give 'em hellk!!
Thank you, Senator Casey
Thank you!
Thank you.
That's MY Senator
Go get them.
It is pure insanity that we have to beg for info concerning bills that affect our country. Thank you, Senator!
Keep it up!!
Thank you
Thank you for making us proud, @SenBobCasey!  Wish we could count on @SenPatToomey, but he sold us out a long time ago. #Resist
keep up the good fight!  We are behind you!
what a guy???
Yet the secretive coward colleague @SenToomey hides with his conspirators so no one can see how bad it is. Who are you working 4 @SenToomey?
Thank you, senator!
Thanks for looking out for us.  Where is @SenToomey = @realDonaldTrump
Only reason u want hearings is to use the MSM of the Socialist/democrat party to rin a megative campaign. Y? Because its a CAPITALIST idea
You mean like the open hearings your side DIDN'T HAVE for Ocare??!

'Have to pass it to see what's in it'
Why didn't you do the same for Obamacare? Oh, right, your campaign and grandstanding has begun. #onlytimeweseehim #fraud #resign #hack
Thank u senator. U make PA proud!
Thank you Senator Casey ! Pennsylvanians know you've got our backs. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about Senator Toomey of PA.
Go get them, Bob!!
Give 'em Hell, Senator!
Give 'em Hell, Senator'
Shut em down @SenBobCasey shut em down.
Give 'em hell, Bob!  Thank you for fighting for us.
Thank you, sir!
Thank you Senator! #HoldTheFloor #WITHHOLDCONSENT
I agree that this time around Healthcare needs to be done in the open and I suggest in pieces, e.g. allow insurance across state lines.
Did the @DNC hold open hearings on #Obamacare?
Yes, they did,  as a matter of fact.
We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it,‚Äù is what Pelosi said March 9, 2010 to the National Association of Counties.
Thank you, @SenBobCasey. You stand with us and we stand with you. Give 'em hell. #ShowUsTheBill #WhySoSecretYall #Healthcare
Thank you for representing us.
@SenBobCasey  Thank-you
@SenBobCasey please use my story
@SenToomey at least PA HAS  1 Senator that puts constituents needs 1st over personal profits @SenBobCasey TY 
@TuesdaysToomey @WhatsPatUpTo
Thank you!
Thank You!
Thank you! Us Americans need to be heard! #SaveMedicaid #SaveAmericans from being uninsured under reform.
You said screw the GOP when it came to Obamacare there Bob. Let me quote Obama..."Elections have consequences". Swallow it.
Thank you, Senator Casey.
Thank you Senator Casey!
Atta boy 
Keep up the fight
I don't see why open debate will hurt the bill if it is good. The people deserve input.
Somehow I doubt you felt the same way about the ACA. Maybe I'm wrong, and you did want that to go forward with zero debate or transparency.
He is one of the 13 men writing it, so I would say he supports the secret side.
Thank you!
Go get 'em!
Tell them how it is, sir!  We will NOT tolerate this backhanded crap from Repubs only interested in protecting their rich benefactors!
Please keep fighting the GOP! Americans need quality, affordable health care.
Thank you, Sir!
Okay....just like you & the Dems did with Obama Care?
Exactly. Look up how many hearings were held, amendments considered, etc. on the ACA in almost two years
You must be forgetting the part when it was passed before any of them read it.
Bless you Bob, doing the people's work!
Bob, you're nothing but a Democrat party hack. You have done nothing positive.
Thank you Sen Casey.
Stay strong, don't back down. Millions in PA are counting on you to defend our healthcare!
Thank you!! You are appreciated by this #RealPA
Good luck
Glad you are our Senator! We need you!!
thank you Senator from a PA constituent! give them no ground! #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you! GOP does the very things that they were hysterical about. Total hypocrites. Untrustworthy. 
By all means available short of violence, stop this disaster!
Thank you, @SenBobCasey! You're a champ!
THANK YOU, SENATOR
THANK YOU! #witholdconsent
Keep fighting the good fight!
Grandstanding good for you. When democrats pushed Obamacare through in the dark of night it was ok. You Hippocrates
Thank you, Senator!
PA voters are counting on you to make sure that this healthcare bill is openly discussed and debated ASAP
Go get 'em!
Thank you. Constituent 19341
The people DO NOT want your input. We saw your "input" in #Obamacare. We want it repealed. Nature abhors a vacuum. No replace is needed.
Thank you for your service!
might as well demand a jet pack.
Give them hell!
Good luck. Never happen. They are evil. 2019 must go blue.
Now is not the time to be soft spoken, Sen. Bob. Give 'em "heck"
