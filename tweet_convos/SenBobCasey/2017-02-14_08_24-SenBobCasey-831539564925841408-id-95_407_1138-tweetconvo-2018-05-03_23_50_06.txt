Thank you for DOING YOUR JOB! Dont let them continue to bullsh#t us. #ResistanceInPittsburgh#2018PaybackIsFemale
2/ if Ellison gets DNC chair, he's out of Dem party. 60-70% white working class voted for @realDonaldTrump . You'll lose them.

you're such an embarrassment you alt left must really hate Americans
sounds familiar. Sort of like Benghazi. THE PEOPLE know it wasn't a video but an inept foreign policy by Obama/Clinton. Waiting
remember bob..your in a trump state..stop trying to grab headlines your party failed in November.
Where were you -Benghazi, IRS, Solydra? When President Obama promised "flexability" after his election? Politics!
RESIST I RESIST you ughhhh
We are sick and tired of your stone walling and trying to do whatever you can to discredit this president. Flynn stepped down
Liking the new more vocal @SenBobCasey
Agreed!  So proud.
me too!  Inspired
grabbing at every straw you can find.  Can't wait till you're gone! Trump isn't going anywhere.
Proud in PA! Keep this going - country before politics!
Make America Sane Again. Dump Trump
1st the illegal leakers. Doug Schoen says if you don't start working with Trump, you'll lose Dem party forever 2/
Tweety Amin is actually calling it FAKE NEWS 
do something about repealing and replacing Obama care. U know the insurance that doesn't apply to u because of the laws u write
"Lock him up,! Lock him up!
Monotone deaf zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz huh? oh still talkin ughh zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
You blocked his attorney general. Distraction? You are in full attack.
will you be my Twitter Valentine? Because you are killing it lately and I truly love it.
@wbrewyou Hot mic. I'll have more flexibility after the election. Let's investigate the Uranium sales to Russia, too.
@Shakestweetz America's just gone from Obamacare to TrumpDon'tGiveaDamn in a nanosecond.
I'll save you dudes a lot of work: #trump knew everything and has known since b/f he announced his candidacy.
Flynn has no foreign policy experience - look at his background. This job was never a good fit for his experience or skill.
What other investigations have u called for ?P.s.  ~> a weak Candidate/failed policies =election loss, lol not the Russians 
Keep pushing those do nothing republicans!
@JaxDeeDee thankyou senator there is no more important business than clearing up this matter.# RememberBengazi
how about we start investigating why Dems didn't care when Obama did the same thing (hot mic comment) shame on you
Stay on this Senator Casey! Do not let up!
Uphill battle Keep the course
that line should be in needlepoint
@gbollmann01 yes demand it- check out:  #TrumpLeaks - chronology of corruption & Rissian ties in there.
you have the support of at least 65 million people!!!!!
YOUR A FRAUD
go get 'em!
yes, the Obama WH. Why are employees of Ex-POTUS spying on the 2017Transition and how many are there?
Thank you for pressing the issue!
thank you for taking a stand. I wish @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein weren't so quiet about this.
Thanks Sen. Casey! From a constituent in East Stroudsburg!
@SpeakerRyan the investigation of @realDonaldTrump should begin immediately
and bruh, we expect you to handle your business.
YES!  THANK YOU!!!
Thank you Senator Casey.
This started under Obama. What did he know or plan and when, who, how?
Do you support the firing and any criminal prosecution of those illegally releasing information from the government?
@wbrewyou step down
Thank you!
Thanks for all you do & taking the right stand.
Democrats are such hypocrites. Susan Rice lied to Americans deaths caused by a video!
Yes, Senator Casey. Please keep pushing!!
is making us proud!
when your party controls congress you can do that
Thank you, Senator Casey!
Agreed. Let's also go ahead and investigate Hillary and the Muslim Brotherhood IT guys the Dems just fired.
Trump told Flynn to do that & hoped it wouldn't be found out. Once it was he forced Flynn to resign so he appears not guilty.
Thank for representing your constituents and standing up for what is right.
.@SenBobCasey @changingger Less talky more do-ey.
Seriously, what's it going to take for @DevinNunes & corrupt @GOP to investigate @realDonaldTrump & his employees? @SenBobCasey #russiagate
please b treason. Please b #treason. There's no library, right? Get the Real#45 in

Promise you will run in 2020
yes! Investigate, investigate!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely!!! Trump's collusion with Russia to win an election?  Isn't that jail worthy? He's so corrupt!
At least Nixon did his own dirty work. Trump had to have Russians do it.
Thank you, Senator. Keep pushing, please?
unfortunately the @jasoninthehouse and the @HouseGOP are so partisan & out of touch with constituents they will do nothing
keep the dominoes falling senator
is the AG the only person who can appoint an independent counsel to investigate?
fake CNN and anarchist  senator in action
Flynn was previously hired by Russia Today, an Eng-language propaganda television station funded by Putin and the Russ gov.
Do not let them off the hook for this or handling nat. security matters at dinner in a public place. Keep the pressure up!
.@SenBobCasey Thanks, Senator. I'm proud to have voted for you. Keep fighting the good fight.
and why the FBI director sat on the dossier & told Yates not to tell the WH about Flynn
I expect you to get on board w an investigation, @MarkWarner @timkaine @SenBobCasey
Trump, Pence, Flynn... they ALL need to be investigated for treason!! Please, congress needs to do something!! @SenSanders
time to drain the swamp and start #ImpeachTrump process. #TreasonousTrump
Go after these guys. They'll make Watergate  crooks look like Geniues
And if they directed him to act as he did.
u need to investigate wen trump was on campaign that's wen it started
Pleased to see this; I just left you a message about it a few minutes ago.
