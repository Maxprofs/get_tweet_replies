Awesome! I'm coming to Philly from UK for first time this May. Looks great!
If u want to truly understand essence of Phila go to City Hall Crtyard & read Wm Penn's prayer.
Thanks Susan
You're welcome. Always brings tears for me, especially when I see the city suffer with urban difficulties. Hope remains. Have fun
