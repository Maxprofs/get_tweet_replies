Vipers nest

Thanks again and again.  Keeping us all working overtime.
Ghost of Nixon wakes up...stretches..says "Don, you could use my help" DeepThroat says "Let me know when its MY turn"

Best. Casey. Tweet. Ever.
It's Kushner. I'm calling it.
Sources saying it's Jared kuschner
Story after story being exposed as lies from WaPo and you leftist morons keep drinking the kool-aid. Wake the Hell up.
Make sure our healthcare, internet, environment, education, press freedom, right to protest and many other civil liberties are protected.

Surrounds himself with only the best and most serious people.
I am saying Jared!
I hear the Hindenburg was well oiled indeed
A well oiled machine?  As well oiled as an Edsel.
Shame it's Soviet military surplus oil.

#TrumpRussia is a hoax and trying to score political points on it is immoral and pointless. @theDemocrats are obstructive and misleading.
A hoax? Can I have some of the drugs you are doing?
You are well aware there is no single official proof of that "connection" revealed. There will be none. Just political game. We all lose.
Keep drinking the swamp water...
@realDonaldTrump will be the president for the next 8 years regardless of what kind of water I drink. And Dems base is falling apart.
OMG!!!  Stop smoking wacky weed or I will give you the name of a reputable dealer.
Yep, 8 more years. He will build the wall by the way. And the reason for this success are @TheDemocrats bogged down in #TrumpRussia nonsense

I'm saying Reince Priebus.
The best vetting.
Who in WH ISN'T involved?
The White House is bugged and I'm pretty sure that's illegal.  Not a smart thing to say IF it is true.
The oil is Russian
So grateful you're my Senator!
Yes well oiled.... with dirty oil
I LOVE that you are MY SENATOR!!!
Thank you for ALL that you do Sir !!!!
My question there Senator is why does the Wapo already know who the persons of interest are?  This gov't is like a ship made of swiss cheese
Bob Casey, you rock!
Fine-tuned fiasco.
Definitely oily.
Winning!

Snake oil?
