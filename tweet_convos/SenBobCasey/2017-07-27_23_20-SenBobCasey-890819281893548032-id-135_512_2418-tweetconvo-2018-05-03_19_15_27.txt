McCain is a Scumbag.
Thank you for doing the right thing from the beginning. McCain's vote wouldn't have been possible without you and the rest of the D caucus.
And Senators Collins and Murkowski.
Thank you democrats, Senator McCain, Senator Collins, and Senator Murkowski for voting against the skinny health care bill.
And @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins .... RIGHT?
Please do not forget to thank Susan Collins & Lisa Murkowski. Both women have said 'no' from the beginning & got a lot of heat for it
Its only right that @SenBobCasey and his staff sign up for Obamacare to help pay for his voting base's HealthCare #DumpCasey
We're already on Obamacare. I have to buy my plan through the DC exchange instead of selecting a FEHB plan like the rest of fed employees.
I feel your pain.
Indeed. The Maverick strikes again. Proud to be a former Arizonan right now. Country over party.
His motivations were nothing to be proud of. Right outcome, wrong reasons for it.
Not courageous to lie to the people that voted for you !
and the other female senators that have not waivered.
I hate D.C. Lies.
Ah yes, courageous indeed. Take away health insurance from tax payers, while demanding they still pay for yours.
Take McCain, please!
Let's thank the women, too!
Thank YOU @SenBobCasey for listening to your PA constituents!
McCain did something you never did with Obamacare. McCain stood up for the people- agree or disagree with his position.
Courageous?  I think you meant to say "cowardly".
Too bad PA did not elect Katie McGinty to displace the disastrous cretin Toomey. Thank you for your vote
What about Senators Murkowski & Collins?  They never voted yes - he did.
Repeal the 17th Amendment! It's time for you to go, Bob. #repeal17
songbird McCain
He's a weasel. That's all. He knows it
And he made the best vote going........
Courageous??? He told his constituents for years he would repeal ACA. Betrayal.
It's not courage to vote no on something because it didn't do enough to hurt Americans.
Also that you @lisamurkowski & @SenatorCollins
McCain is a democrat and an ass just like you
Thank you for your vote to save our health care.
don't forget @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins as these women are also deserving of hero status.
And thanks to you, Senator for standing up for us all along.
Do not forget @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins. McCain DID NOT DO THIS ALONE.
And Senators Murkowski and Collins!
Well no. It's really called betrayal. Right, Mr. McCain?
Casey is an idiot period
Will be voting u out! Why don't u pay my healthcare bills! Did u read Obamacare bill before voting on it?
Yes! And @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski thank you Senators for being sensible and doing your jobs. As opposed to the rest of the GOP
Thank you Senator Casey for your tireless work. You are Pennsylvania's hero!!!
Thanks also to Murkowski and Collins who were bullied by their own party.  Mend it, don't end it. #Obamacare
your both pathetic i will work to see you not reelected casey you have screwed working families in pennsylvania long enough
He is.... Mr Wishy Washy!!
This picture says it all.... You can have the traitor!
Thank you both. Sen. Casey for your tireless efforts on behalf of the people and Sen McCain for your vote
Thank you to all those like @SenBobCasey whose vote was never in doubt
RINO, brain cancer is deeper than first suspected.
Agree thank you Senator McCain
Thank you Senator McCain. I know you took the hit for many moderates. Sept will be time to find a bipartisan way to fix ACA.
Thanks to both Senators and hoping  that everyone can work together for the best interest of all the American people.
Thank you. Now get back to work; do all you can to engage bi-partisanship.
And Sen. Collins and Sen. Murkowski for standing up to bullies
There are no words thank you doesn't seem enough
And actually Collins and Murkowski were more heroic if that's the spin you're looking for
Thank you, too, @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins, for standing firm for the people from the beginning. That took guts!
I think he's faced more dangerous situations, senator. Sen McCain did the right thing, eventually. Not your best tweet.

Thank YOU Senator Casey for speaking up constantly and bringing this evil to light.
Thank you both, restoring my faith (a bit) in the dignity of the Senate.
More like Coward!
Thanks to the women @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski as well. Courageous in consistently standing up for their constituents & what's right.
You're a joke!  There's 1 insurer in PA. My rates up over 200%. obamacare is falling apart.  RUN ON GOVT MEDICINE! #CharlieGard #DEATHPANEL
What about the women that voted No earlier than @SenJohnMcCain did? #femaleerasure
It takes courage to cast a vote that DOES NOT strip millions of health care?

What fucking planet is THAT?!

Leave the senate,ur of no value
Tommy this is a small win, but we are desperate for wins right now with a president who is a pathological lying narcissistic buffoon!
Welp, it is not heroic to defy a "pathologically lying narcissistic buffoon".
I'm all for incremental victories not shaded as such -
Thank you BOTH! This Pennsylvanian thank s you for your vote!
Thank you, Sen McCain!
And @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins
I am happy for John.
Amen and God Bless Senator McCain! Always Brave!
Don't thank him. He left his sickbed to be psychologically abusive to his constituents just so y'all would do exactly this. He's scum.
Let's not forget these people will be replaced.
@JenniferGassman @SenJohnMcCain Mc Cain will always be an Americans hero
Had McCain voted No, obviously..
which we could have avoided had you voted "No" on the debate..
It is an indictment on the state of the US when it takes courage to vote NOT to take away millions of people's health insurance. But thanks!
@SenToomey this is what courage looks like

Giving McCain the credit for defeating this repeal when female Senators Murkowski & Collins were early NOs is EVERY WORK MEETING EVER.
And @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski. Real leadership. Onto improving the #ACA for ALL Americans
He is a democrat. And an embarrassment to republican voters in AZ who have premiums up by 120%. Which insurance company paid u off?
@SenJohnMcCain thank you so very much. U are truly a Maverick and an honorable Gentleman. You are truly a hero!God Bless You.  @maddow
Forgot the 2 women senators that didn't back down the first time didn't you Senator? @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins
God bless you and thank you for putting your country over the party
Why Couragous? At Long Last He Did His Job. He Simply Did The Right Thing. He Gets Free Healthcare & So Does His Family. Lifetime Income $$
courageous?  to screw of the American people who are fined because they can't afford healthcare?  I hope he is voted out of office soon.
Thank you John McCain 
Don't worry, @SenBobCasey, your time as Senator is up soon. Looking forward to the vote of courageous Pennsylvanians ousting you to 2018.
Single Payer needs to be next!
Thank you Senator Casey for your tireless work through this!
And what's your idea? Single payer? Bankrupt America? Socialism?Democrats are cowards, not one went against their party! All cowards!
Don't forget the ladies They have been with you from the beginning They are true Sheroes @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins 
What's Courageous about it he's been on the record forever against Obamacare used personal animus to stick it to Trump. Just a vendetta
Fuck him
I don't have to be terrorized tomorrow. 
Agreed plus @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski thank you.
um, no. McCain has kept me up at night in panic for 2 days. Courage is @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins who faced WH threats
How about we get ur colleague @SenToomey on the same page
Don't forget the bravery of the other two. Not bullied by their own party.
And thank you, sir, for yours.
And @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins and @SenateDems
And @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski !!  

Senator Collins has been on the right side of this fight since day one.
Also, Senator Murkowski stayed true despite what essentially amounts to ugly pressure/mafia-like tactics from a very embarrassing president.
All kudos to Murkowski, but she actually is voting for what is best for Alaskans. They'd get crushed by the expected premium increases.
As will MILLIONS in other gop states who simply votes to protest the past pres and with party lines.
I'm grateful, but still miffed that it didn't have to be this frightening because McCain could have ended it days ago.
Murkowski and Collins were nos from the start. They deserve your thanks too.
Absolutely I thank all 3 for putting country over politics
Don't forget Collins and Murkowski! They took heat for this and will probably continue to.
John did good. Thank you, Senators.
You MUST thank @SenSusanCollins & @lisamurkowski , too!
You all are heroes
Let's not forget Markowsky and Collins
thank both of you for your votes ..you did PA proud, Sen Casey
And thank you @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski
And thank you Senator Casey!!
From a family who had catastrophic medical expenses pre-ACA, I thank all of you who voted to protect our health care. I was terrified.
Statists gotta' state.
A true statesman. Thank you for putting the good of the people over the good of your party.
....and @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski (fixed that one for you, buddy) #SkinnyRepeal
Dont forget @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski they were courageous from the start.
Thank you to two BADASS women 
Thank you for the fight..
And thank you @SenBobCasey for yours and all you do daily to fight for us here in Pa.
Thank the women
and thank you Senator Casey for yours.
Don't forget Murkowsky and Collins.
