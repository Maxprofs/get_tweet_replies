Disgusting that these individuals have no heart or souls. Those may be the only meals they have all day!
Trump is only cutting Federal funds!!! That's about 3% of Meals on Wheels funding. #fakenews
How many elderly people going without meals does that 3% translate to?
7 million meals actually.
I know who to donate to this year.
exactly!!!!! DONATE!!!! Not force my money to go to it if I don't want
Your greed will eat you from the inside out.
no, no, no. It's only 3%. That will be made up in donations
God Bless You
This is something surely all Americans can support. Food and friendship to people who appreciate and need it
Outrage on Wheels
My grandfather retired from his job and then worked YEARS delivering meals to seniors and he did it because
he loved knowing those people had someone to talk to everyday because for MOST he was the only person these
people saw all week. How can anyone be so cruel as not only to deprive them of meals but also their
contact with other people.  It breaks my heart that this program that help so many could even be up for
discussion in a budget while we buy more bullets and bombs than anyone else on the planet.  If this passes I
will have officially lost hope that this is a good country because this budget says we only care about wars
Isn't it the "Christian" thing to do? Help those in need? Why do Republican's hate so much?
@esquire666 @PeterAlexander I'm sending them a donation
How much does it cost to keep Melania in NYC with security where she clearly does not have to be? How much does it cost to fly to Maralago?
Meals on Wheels is about spiritual generosity, human connection & genuine compassion. The nourishment goes well beyond food.
Well said, so true
Unfortunately, we have to pay for his weekend getaways, his wife's captivity and security for his adult kids
You are not a truth teller.
before MOW, housebound seniors paid money didn't have for delivery or went hungry.  Take care of them!
@tammylynne89 Tammy, had 4 people try n flip me warning me abt you and false media. Blocked them immediately
Warn u bout me??
yep said "that socialist Tammy Lynne" Your famous! I'm with you, no worries
Thank you. I'm famous!
Problem with the #republicanparty members think @_MealsOnWheels go to blacks #MOW feeds #All #Americans elderly & Vets @PeterAlexander
#LyinRyan #GoPISStealing #TraitorMitch thanks for the fxxxxx mercy

@_MealsOnWheels @HelpThe99ers 
#rediculous 
To scare elderly and shut-ins like this, they barely get by thx to Part D now this?
@JuddApatow @ProjectOpenHand @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @cher @GeorgeTakei @margaretcho @BetteMidler @godslovenyc
my dad uses Meals on Wheels. Thank you for all that you do.
@Rosie @PeterAlexander How can we donate to meals on wheels????
@Semperfelix @PeterAlexander in other words, a total failure. The priorities and incompetency of this admin is breathtaking
most helpers are all on volunteer to help. @JedediahBila
00% agree I benefited when I fractured my foot & gave to MOW for 1 year I was so grateful. They check on u.
I
@davidpsdem @PeterAlexander my mother would not have made it. She had nutrition and companionship and that is precious
@davidpsdem @PeterAlexander my retirement papers and come home to care for her. That is a gift I cherish because without it
@davidpsdem @PeterAlexander overseas and could not return to help her. You all stepped in till I could finalize my 2.
Thank you #MealsOnWheels for providing my dad with nutritious meals at a time in his life when he needed it
@antipandemonium @PeterAlexander my dad had Parkinson, he depended on meals on wheels
@VeeVee @PeterAlexander this is fake news. Published this morning. You're a paid agitator. People are onto you.
I also volunteered twice in my state.
@mommala728 trump is a trash president who does NOT care about Americans!
your organization, MOW, does amazing work. Thank you!
Fake @potus wants to kill program that serves 2.4 million+ seniors, including 500,000 veterans. Insane.
my nephew w/down syndrome goes to an adult program. one of their jobs is to deliver meals & he <3 it
fake.they pay a monthly fee for the sevices.All workers are volunteers.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump R INTENTIONALLY committing GENOCIDE onneedy
Thank you. I am one of those Seniors that he's trying to kill. I'm younger than him, didn't rip off govt.
well apparently it's not going to meet anyone's needs!
Making war on the elderly. The children and clean air and water. This is America!?
These are facts! This administration doesn't do facts.
It's most productive to combat complaint with action; thus, I've now volunteered time & to #MealsonWheels.
... if they can't continue living at home, maybe their homes can be purchased cheap by developers.
Hmmm.
@WhiteHouse @RevDrBarber @BishopJSelders @CNN @HouseGOP @BernieSanders @SpeakerRyan @NBCNews @McFiredogg
@PrincessBravato @PeterAlexander we know that. But for politics sake, they'll lie. Sad!
according to charity watch 24 % of your budget goes to overhead, can you elaborate? @CNN
Meals on Wheels rocks! I'm behind you!
sometimes their only interaction and meal in a day.
@peterframpton @PeterAlexander hey Peter, stay out of politics and try to get your failing career back. Stop gloom & doom
@billyeichner @PeterAlexander They get 3% of funding from program being cut
Christian thing is charitable giving of your money. Not charitable giving of other peoples money.
MonW is not individually funded. Part of Community Block Grants. States fund as they see fit
Sadly your President doesn't give a about seniors. @PeterAlexander
amazing that they believe these programs don't work because the data is not what they want it to look like.
In 2016, majority of seniors voted for Trump. Majority of seniors voted against Meals on Wheels. Sad.
Meals on Wheels is an important program. Only an immoral person would slash funding for it.
I don't have many followers, but, pls follow Meals On Wheels. They need our support more than ever.
it's
I've worked w/ #MealsonWheels;many of our elders use this program & they r SO humble&grateful.This is wrong!
God Bless the good work you do.  This program will not be terminated.
What sort of country where leaders say feeding elderly doesn't work?
MOW programs - a life line for millions of seniors!  Demonstrate outstanding cost, health & personal outcomes
Meals on wheels is state run program.
Someone at WH Press meeting, needs to ask dT if he knows how Meals on Wheels works. Prob. not.
@GunnerGale it takes a special type of bastard to take food away from elderly any lower & it'll be taking edu TV from kids
ARe they suppose to be free?  Not in my state.
thanks to meals on wheels my grandma  gets at least 1 cooked meal a day!! Sad the will defund
Many Elders aren't checked on by family's, WHY, Back to  topic,for MANY it is the only socialization &HUGS

@billyeichner @PeterAlexander you could donate your big bucks for this right? How much do you donate?
States and Communities have to take responsibility for taking care of their seniors and disabled.
It is about creating social unrest. Pitting one interest group against another. Their goal.
@powhatannative @PeterAlexander they get to visit with who delivers. Best program ever. Spreads the love to the lonely.
starvation by the #Governts is population control...acceptable genocide.
@ericgarland @PeterAlexander  They won't touch meals on wheels. Other programs - lunch for kids, Yes & others
Thank you @realDonaldTrump - all because of you (who I do NOT follow), I started following @_MealsOnWheels today. So glad I did! 
gov't doesn't need to feed people,should be self funding or run from donations and volunteers
I'm a home health nurse in a rural community. Meals on wheels saves the lives of my patients.
@powhatannative the disabled can also access this. It's not results driven unless the result is so they EAT! Some won't.
Well apparently the Fake President wants them to starve.  For a damn wall!!
@ericgarland @PeterAlexander let's get it burning #feednotwar
@OHDems @PeterAlexander I wish the shoe was on the other foot for just 1day! GOP wants the poor 2 die & rich 2 get richer
It is a necessary service to keep them alive .. some cant cook r afford this One Meal A Day ...
@ericgarland @PeterAlexander I am heartbroken that this is happening. If you've ever cared for elderly, u know what I mean.
@GunnerGale @PeterAlexander Yes! It makes ends meet for someone in need just one meal could make a difference!
it is a mortal sin to take this program away because it will kill people
#maga @_MealsOnWheels @PeterAlexander
.
#christian people, see how suspect your sanctimony becomes when your Trump does evil in your names?
I respect what you do & think Prez is making a huge mistake. @DianneWing2 @PeterAlexander
not really as in ohio you only deliver microwave meals back in the day you did hot meals
Thank you for all you do!
We need them out! Everyday is a new freaking horror!
@SenBobCasey @PeterAlexander Meals on Wheels feeds 500,000 veterans annually. Taking food from hungry veterans is not ok.
-> @VanJones68
I have witnessed years of #MealsOnWheels gracing the doors of many a lonely senior in my town! Thank YOU 
My grandmother was on MOW
Lived to 101
Allowed her2stay in her home
Kept public costs down, gave her dignity & peace of mind
Great program but not specifically funded. Trump isn't cutting it, but is cutting generic federal funds
@MsBirch @PeterAlexander Great program. #ROC @LovelyWarrenRoc dissed 25 million Maybe @ThomasGolisano will help out!!
This is sadism.
You deliver a lot of value
@SenBobCasey If there's a HELL Mike Mulvaney and @POTUS are heading there. MoWs & LIHEAP help the poor. SAD!
You can't be a Christian and a supporter of Mutant Mussolini.
@billyeichner @PeterAlexander how does he sleep at night? Special place in hell for people that think like repubs
And helps keep folks out of nursing homes, which costs too.: http://m.content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/10/1796.abstract …
It's so far beyond disgusting that this is even being considered. This shows true character of Trump/GOP.
I've contributed to @_MealsOnWheels, have worked w volunteers who went door to door. #MealsonWheels is a lifesaving program. #pressbriefing
Obviously @POTUS+@VP+@PressSec+@GOP & Mick Mulvaney all hate seniors and want the opposite of whats shown in the infographic
@EricBlake12 @PeterAlexander can't believe we are even having to discuss this :(
@FPWA @PeterAlexander providing hot meals, and a little bit of human contact, as well! Must needed during isolated winters.
why blame trump? We know the Russians did this!
@JuddApatow @PeterAlexander I have had the privilege of volunteering with this amazing organization. They do amazing work
well I think it's time to say goodbye.
i hope all the folks that cheer on trump nvr find thmslvs or families n need. there but for the grace of god
@iamfondag @PeterAlexander Don the Con doesn't think feeding poor seniors is important #trumpbudget You get what you pay for
@JessicaValenti @PeterAlexander @mickmulkvaney#mickmulvaney
@SenateDems -this man that slithered n2 our WH  is insane..Seniors now...the Poor.. children..Cln water..ACA
@JessicaValenti @PeterAlexander And feeds how many veterans? 
@JuddApatow @PeterAlexander anyone who wants to cut this program is unfit to serve in government
You don't understand how it's funded. It's not specifically funded
Just LQQK at all of the simpletons that are commenting.  They are precious!!
EXXONMOBIL IS MORE IMPORTANT...... WEALTH OVER HEALTH WEALTH OVER HEALTH WEALTH OVER HEALTH... TRUMPF HATE
@lpolgreen @PeterAlexander We love you Meals on Wheels! @realDonaldTrump
We believe you and believe in you. @_MealsOnWheels @PeterAlexander
@ShaneWatch @PeterAlexander how can #MealsonWheels possibly survive with 3% less funding.
yes it is!!
feeding Americans not on Trumps agenda, his hero USSR KGB Col Putin helped starve millions @_MealsOnWheels @whitefishglobal @PeterAlexander
only 3% of MOW budget funded by Feds.  #sheep
My parents get it. Valuable help. Neither of them are capable of preparing meals any more.
I don't know anyone that hasn't been touched by the Meals on Wheels program. It is invaluable!
it's like they're trying to target the most vulnerable among us. They're Dickensian villains
MOW gets less than 3% from Feds.   By the way, how much do you donate to MOW?
@SenBobCasey @PeterAlexander  WE DO NOT NEED THE FEDERAL GOVT TO FUND EVERYTHING PEOPLE!!  THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY!!
For many seniors this is their only meal & human contact.They already don't have enough $to meet the needs
, MOW IS WORKING A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN CONGRESS!!
we will all be seniors under the toxic umbrella left behind by incompetent admin.
Because FACTS, ya'll.
Thank you for all you do! Just donated!
Do you think we should kill or keep #mealsonwheels? Tweet:

#keepmealsonwheels 
OR
#dumpmealsonwheels
It's ludicrous to take something that means so much to others away.
As a child I would help deliver meals and people were so appreciative of just  basic human connection and kindness.
@SenBobCasey @PeterAlexander Sadley, the democrats favor funding abortion over feeding seniors
You have no damned clue what you're talking about, do you?
@thepoliticalcat @PeterAlexander Yes but how else can Trump get you to look the other way & forget Russia stole your country
@sciencebetty @PeterAlexander Many states, usually GOP-controlled, put tax cuts ahead of social safety nets.
less than 3% of MOW budget funded by Feds.  Educate yourself
I wish a pox on the entire disgustingly selfish administration!
welcome to #TrumpEugenics
please don't let this sorry excuse for a government take away Meals On Wheels
America supports you.
It helps seniors 'age in place'  policy nowdays; it lessens/delays expensive nurs/home costs-pd by Medicaid.
Plenty of people out there looking for legitimate charities like MOW, should be privately funded not taxes.
This "administration" has no common decency or respect for people. We know your program helps those who need it.
You forgot common sense...
so how much do you donate to MOW?
Volunteers also call in if the senior does not come to the door and their family member is notified.
Thank you for everything you do for others. Those of us with hearts & souls will support you 100%!
will you support them with your donation $$$. ??
Trump is  heartless & inhumane living in Trump tower all these yrs no empathy for anyone but wealthry
logic & facts doesn't work with this group.  Win a lottery for millions and they might care about you...
I've volunteered for MOW— it uplifts EVERYONE involved; feeds the hungry; and is preventive care for srs! @_MealsOnWheels @PeterAlexander
Great Potato Famine Mulvaney doesn't look like he knows the results of famine
Good 'ole racist genocide jokes.
Thank you. It's a wonderful service.
HEY @DomenicoNPR what have you got to say now.
what'd he say?
When Spicer said that there is no proven benefit to Meals on Wheels, I was irate!! Feeding the elderly :)
Or the program for feeding children-he said no evidence that they learn betterWow.
