The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even......
People are losing faith that anything will be done. No investigations, not even a sternly-worded statement.
Wait til  Monday when Congress is back. We will hear more then. I think it's still game on
a Special Council is needed as @SenBobCasey tweeted.
we the people demand a special investigation council
please make it happen
@respectinc @realDonaldTrump @FBI Yeap ties.
Have sense of humor will travel.
just found out abt House Bill610 -please mobilize on this. Our kids are at stake.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/610 â€¦
Thank You for sharing this! It is one of the primary goals of Education Secretary Betsy DeVose.
@cbvet420 @realDonaldTrump @FBI Now that the leaks and tweaks have come full circle, 45 can't take the pressure #PressKeepOn
and an investigation into why Comey got to keep his job
agree 100%
Absolutely Senator!
A special counsel really is warranted at this point.
Could someone please investigate this bad hombre = @realDonaldTrump
while we are calling for @FBI investigations maybe they can look into your campaign donations from big Pharma Bob.
I thought investigations already underway? This cannot be delayed.

please protect the first amendment
this is conflicts of interest corruption at the highest level INVESTIGATION Now!
your party lost the election fair and square. So stop looking for a scape goat.
this is so troubling--a sitting POTUS publicly attacking his own investigating agencies. I'm at a loss.
Bob with all the haters out there if there was a connection would be out already. FBI said none. Go home.
when did they say that?
"no evidence"
we all agree outside investigation please! How?
and after @FBI handed him the election on a silver platter.
stop the hate
about Soviet Union is miss understanding KGB n FBI to understand how my policy.
Waiting for him to start in on Congress. It's bound to happen the first time you folks don't do what he proposes.
Agreed!  Special Counsel immediately.
I thought freedom of the press how about the press secretary leaving out some news outlets.
Thx Sen. Casey keep fighting for the truth!
Is DJ Trump only aware that he is a mere puppet into #Poutine's hands and will to attack democracies?
have you seen Trump Dossier Analysis:Corroborating the Evidence:
@PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump @FBI thank you #SenatorBobCasey @MaxineWaters @funder @SenWarren #truth #democracy #justice
So who can make this investigation happen?Less talk& more action
perhaps you ought to investigate the leakers but they're 44s holdovers so I won't see you asking that
How much more lunacy are Americans expected to take from this cesspool administration?
@awesomemom5150 @realDonaldTrump @FBI America supports your efforts! We need the truth!!
@awesomemom5150 @realDonaldTrump @FBI trend up this issue!!
Give'em Hell Bobby C !!!
WAY TO GO, FBI !
@masg66 @realDonaldTrump @FBI he continues to act like a spoiled rich kid not getting his way. So over it! Not my president
Unless you live in a different country, he is. Get over it, snowflake
What DJT calls leaks translates to patriotism Time 4 ur fellow Congressppl to show theirs. Thanks 4 yours
#Investigate!
@thenurse75 @realDonaldTrump @FBI It's only a leak if you're hiding something
@marcushjohnson @realDonaldTrump @FBI Thank you for standing up Senator!
He was fine w leaks when they helped him get elected. American public deserve to know the truth!
A "Wall" was built by all the corrupt cabinet picks like Sessions. Those who should drive an investigation will squash it.
Couldn't agree more.
I wish you were my senator. @realDonaldTrump @FBI
Independent and non-partisan, please. If you want us to believe the results, that is.
But FBI went to WH to tell them about their investigation! FBI is guilty here too!
Isn't there one?  Can the Dems get together and send unified message?
Dems get together? Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha nope
and Comey, Chaffetz, and any GOP leaders who may be complicit/compromised due to info Russian may have on them.
I sincerely hope this happens.
Senator Casey, as a constituent, I support you in standing up to those who want to take down our gov't.
@damonbethea1 @realDonaldTrump @FBI @HerreraBeutler What is going on? Investigate now! We have a right to know!
that's how DT operates attack when he doesn't get his way throws a tantrum like a 2 year when told NO
@gary_weiss @realDonaldTrump @FBI For PA voters. Remember this guy is up for election in 2018.....has done 0 in Senate.
If POTUS truly says there are no ties then he should appoint a special counsel himself.
That's one lesson he learned from Nixon; never appoint a special council against one's self
poor poor Donny. Is that the smell of fear knowing he finally went too far obstructing investigations?
Thank you, Senator Casey! Please continue to push for an investigate into Trump Admin ties to Russia! How can we help?
R U doing all U can 2 facilitate the naming of INDEPENDENT COUNCIL w/ abilities to Prosecute???
@ZeddRebel @realDonaldTrump @FBI irony--encourage foreign hacking and release of classified info when it help you but now......
Stay on it Senator!
agreed. @POTUS is a danger to our democracy and safety of the entire world.  Vigorously investigate Russia/Trump conspiracy.
Please stay on this like a dog w a bone. This must not be swept under the rug!
thank you! And yes! This is essential. 
, 
One of your constituents

where's his taxes can do that it will tell alot
@RepErikPaulsen please investigate now
someone is nervous about what the FBI might find.
thank you senator! Keep up the pressure for a special counsel.
We need to put pressure on Washington ourselves.  We need to protest for an independent commission
What r u doing to exert pressure on Congressional R's to make this happen?  Seems like just talk lately.
