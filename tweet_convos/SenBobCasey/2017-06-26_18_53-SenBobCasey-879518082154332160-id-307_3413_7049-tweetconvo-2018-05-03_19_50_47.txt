Thanks for fighting when my senators won't. @JohnCornyn & @tedcruz must thaw their frozen hearts & stop stuffing pockets! #AmericaSpeaksOut
Good news for you: its a long shot, but Beto O'Roarke is running against Ted Cruz next year. Together, there is a chance we could take Texas
@BetoORourke is not a she, and YES he does!
I don't care what you think. We actually care about helping people. That will always win in the end!
You collect your participation trophies while we actually win.
We play the long game while you only think about today.  If you think the senate healthcare plan doesn't effect company plans, you're wrong!
Good 4 U Chuckles Can U line up former NY residents who left because the economy taxes housing and energy costs are crazy and no 24oz Cokes!
STOP! The real point here is that its a huge transfer of wealth to the rich. You can't see that? Use that! Or are U colluding with GOP?
We all know this, but that wealth transfer is a far slower cause if death than the sick losing healthcare!
With respect. Not everyone knows. People need to know that greed is ruining this country. The diff betw haves & have nots is growing. FAST!
We know it's greed, but when your whole house is on fire, you try to put out the fire closest to you, and that's deathcare, then wealthcare.
Those in power are stronger when the masses are at odds. That's their ONLY source of power. We all come together & they are in trouble.
What nonsense. You passed Obamacare, I lost my doc & plan each year my premiums are now $800 a month. You are responsible for this disaster
Yet the insurance companies are making more money than ever. Someone is to blame, just not Democrats.
You are kidding... right? Dems allowed the Ins companies to write the law which included tax payers bailing them out to give them profits.
You mean ending the recession?
My sis has two brain aneurysms. She will die w/o medications and biyearly mri's to keep eye on size. This bill is a death sentence for her!!
Bet there's not a Republican there. They probably all cleared out ASAP so as not 2  b late home for dinner. Forget the American People
This is what representation looks like! Thank you.
I heard Schumer and Booker were making out - but you didn't hear it from me.
Every person in my family has a preexisting condition!
We are already paying a $7,000 deductible!
I understand your pain.
But where's Donald???  I thought  he was a 'man of the people'???
Thank you for doing your job. Thank you for being there for these people. Thank you for showing these people that they matter. Thank you !
Yemen's children are killed on a daily basis by Saudi Arabian Airlines and in the protection of America
You clowns have ruined the health care in this country ... wanting a single payer system.  Like they have in Russia... ass clowns
Still waiting for my $2500 in savings.
zThanks for caring enough to be there for the American people.
Probably exhausted lifetime cap  two cancer operations one lymph node operation, gall bladder&bladder operation+cancer care
Get those who have Obamacare but cannot use it because their deductibles are so high!  More of those than your group of preexist conditions
Obamacare is a disaster.  Best political strategy is to let it fail.  Potus can't do that.  He is saving your asses. Not that you deserve it
Deathcare
First thing stop calling it Trumpcare.... It should be tagged as it is.. #wealthcarebill
Trumpcare.
#TrumpCareKills
As a fellow American with High Blood Pressure with a husband who has type 2 Diabetes, I thank all of you for speaking out.  We all must..
Thank you listening to these very important voices in the healthcare debate!
These are the same people who have such high deductibles Insurance does them no good! It's always been a scam on the taxpayers!  #scammers
= liars
Mother was diagnosed w breast cancer in 2016. Had GOP bill been in effect at the time she'd probably be dead now. Under ACA she's thriving.
Chuck, you remind me of my defense attorney. So, I guess Trump should start doing his cultist rituals, before you crucify him.
THANK YOU!!!!!!
So happy and proud to be part of this movement #Resistance
Democrats are listening to the constituents and fighting for we the people while republicans fight against us hide from us+commit treason!
Nothing more then Demoncrat fearmongering. The sky isn't falling and no one is going to lose their healthcare
I guess you didn't bother hearing the CBO score.
Let's be very clear, GOP does not give a sh*t if ppl live or die.
Every day I wake up unashamed of being a Democrat. Today is another day I can live with pride for supporting you. #TrumpCareKills
#AmericaSpeaksOut Why are you blocking #SinglePayer in California? Why did you block #SinglePayer in Colorado? #Democrats
Because they were paid to.
My daughter cant visit her dad. Preexisting conditions. She's 10. Thanks GOP.
Thank God I'm Canadian and she is still alive.
UrFuckedIfUPass #TrumpCare @realDonaldTrump!
Haters&RacistsLoveTheirFriends&FamilyToo
Pass @SenSanders' #MedicareForAll  2 #RepealAndReplace

Wont see the senate republicans out there..
Do you think they care about anyone's story?
They care about bad publicity and votes.
My 9 year old grandson has a heart defect which has required 3 open heart surgeries so far.  His sister has asthma.  I am on a fixed income
And what are you people actually doing about it?  Stories are great...where is the action? And pleeeeease stop whining about gop.Take charge
We're the minority party in both houses of Congress.All we can do is oppose stuff. Putting forth suggestions is a waste of time @ the moment
Is there. Some think this crap is the only option. To inform as we resist is very important and I believe knowledge isn't a waste of time.
That was a nasty straw man. I never said that knowledge is a waste of time. Ppl should educate selves. However, that is not the job of sens.
I was explaining my position.
Real people, real representation! Bravo
#Trumplackofcare
And so they should. Not my responsibility to fund the irresponsible's health care. Pukes.
Stop #THEHEALTHKILLBILL
I'm tired of sending my money to government to squander on failed federal programs. Look at BOcare crash and burn in front of us.
Save our grandchildren from the spending Dems who don't care how much you your money they spend.
Perhaps, the Senate Dems could support their position by at least telling America what they are proposing? Bankrupt Party without ideas.
Why don't they spend there time more productively presenting ideas to replace a failed system while thanking the GOP who shaw the problem.
Thanks for the good fight. Sad @SenBobCorker and mean @SenAlexander are leaving us Tennesseans in the dust.
#TrumpCare = tax cuts = more loss blood+treasure, baby killers, #back to gilded age (no nothings). Voting power! @SinglePayer4USA
@SenateMajLd: Starve out INSURANCE COMPANIES. When there is no health insurance, we'll enact #SinglePayerNow. @GOP @SenBobCasey @SenSchumer
Come back with single payer. Get a CBO report on that.
#SupportACA #VoteNoTrumpCare
Thank you for fighting for my daughter and others with preexisting conditions when others won't. #crohnsdisease #AmericaSpeaksOut
Thank you. Keep fighting. We will too.

A tale of two parties...
Thank you for representing #WeThePeople 
Even the haters & the losers because we're all Americans & we all pursue life, liberty & happiness
huh... I don't see @VP there?!
Looks like it's better outside that building than in.
Protect the weak from those that will destroy them for those that are strong must stand for all & keep Americans from the GOP DEATH ENGINE!!
Is that what the drug company lobbyists told you to do? So much for middle income Americans. You are just worried about big pharma.
This is awesome!  Do you think and R Senator would dare do this right now??
This "healthcare bill" is #WelfareForTheRich
That's why it's important that we repeal Obamacare with better insurance.
With lifetime caps, my mother would be dead. With annual caps, I would be permanently disabled. #Trumpcare.
Yep, keep up the fear mongering. ACA was nothing more than to control healthcare as an election issue for you to bastardize.
Every time......"The Children"
Lord I pray you're able to stop this madness. I'm also praying for the cruelty we're seeing in fellow Americans.
people with common sense know y'all are doing the right thing we stand with all of you KEEP FIGHTING 
@SenateDems y'all did the right thing by not being part of a bill that is just WRONG I applaud you for standing strong for the people
#trumpcare has no heart @realDonaldTrump
It's time to start pushing for universal healthcare. Get private insurance out of our healthcare.
I can't imagine the stress & tragedy of living in the richest country & having the worst access to HC. Why does the US gov't hate its ppl?
Americans need to hear these stories too. Please record video so everyone can learn about the real ppl affected by this horrible new bill.
Democrats are lying about the facts of the health care bill. MEDICAID spending would INCREASE by 20% over a 10 year period. NOT A CUT
Thank you
We've heard all the stories.  Now we need to know what the plan is to fix Obama care.
@DonaldJTrumpJr THIS is real, Junior! But you and your family have the $$ to afford good care, right?
So U support & will fight 4 Universal Health Care? Didn't think so
Stories are compelling, but we need ACTION! ACT! STOP THIS BILL FROM PASSING, BY EVERY MEANS NECESSARY!

@lisamurkowski @SenCapito @senrobportman @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr are you listening? #VoteNo #DoTheRightThing #DoTheResponsibleThing
Demons sitting on their hands listening to the imps who want stuff free. Govt should be out of healthcare business. Don't forget your checks
Now go get single payer passed.
This is the country in which I believe! 
@SenBillNelson STOP barbaric #BHCA ! STOP @marcorubio & @GOP ! STOP this or will be ANOTHER BIG step closer to tyranny ! #ResistTrumpcare
So with a bunch of suckers who fell for your lies nothing new there they are called Democrat voters they live in fear of everything
Thank you
And your repuglican colleagues are where?? Hiding???
Oh, yeahhh. That's right. That's what will defeat the GOP. Appealing to their feelings and sympathy. Thanks, Dems. We got a winner, there.
Staged politics.Cute.Ineffective.Get engaged,lose the Obama care egos and start contributing to a solution for America not just NO.
From the people who gave you 70 million abortions.
50 and 60 year olds mortgaging their homes to pay for medical care for their younger adult children who lose coverage...
@DaleKanzler If corporations are people then reverse should apply; time to divest, put everything in corporate name in Caymans
Inspiring & exhilarating.
Congress - listen to the people! Stop listening to the Koch brothers. What you are doing is Wrong. 
Black / White.
Inspiring!!! Thank you. This is going viral.
If you do not get to work you hopefully be sitting out on the steps for good!
You are truly appreciated! We know how hard our Democratic Senators are working for all the people & you are so awesome! We are with you!
Please crank up the sound,or drag your R colleagues out there with you. They're the ones who need to hear it!
Can't help but think this was all staged by Dems
Trumpdumpcare will dump Republicans out of office 2018. 
its not going to work the Republicans do not care about anyone or anything except themselves and they have great healthcare coverage
Telling stories to each other like masturbating. You make yourselves feel good & accomplish nothing.  Clock  is ticking. Use time wisely.
Why don't the Dems offer to help fix the healthcare bill publicly so its on record you offered again and the republicans still refused
Now that you know DEMS, tell us your plans to FIX IT! Start telling the American People yours plans to make America ACTUALLY Great Again!
Thank You! I'm disable,preexisting condition..Republicans have hearts made of stone!!!
Most people are now desperate to hear solutions, we feel buried in problems; revision to Obamacare to finalise the message
Please start to introduce a Revision of Obamacare that lowers cost by raising cap gain tax to 8%
Ok socialist commie's. Since when is health care a right! #socialMed Destroyed countries ww. US health care was best until u hijacked it.
Amazing Senators!  Thank you for reminding us that many in Congress remember why they are in DC.
I've got 5/5 w/ something that @SenateGOP  think is a preexisting condition. I have health care through work...until I don't. #Scared
And stop thinking @GOP are civilized patriots who will do the rt thing, they won't!
Get ur ass off the steps and go fight like wild dogs... We're sick of talk, get shit done, get on 1 message and go lower when they go low!
This is horrible parents have to worry like this. I don't know this country anymore.
I agree! Not my Country, but as long as I'm still living in it I'll fight for it! Because it's the right thing to do!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RUSSIAN NARRATIVE??????? HAHAHA LOSERS YOURE OUT ON THE STEPS ACTING LIKE CHILDREN. GET UP AND GO TO WORK. Losers
Where are the Republicans?
My daughter had a preexisting condition when she was 16 yo and in perfect health exc a history of asthma, had to be in hi-risk pool >300/mo
I need to go to one of these and speak is there a list of times and dates for meetings ,anybody in the state of Washington know when & where
What about Moms & Dad's w/cancer (other diseases )that need to take care of children? We die guess who will be paying 4 them!? ??
Amazing #crookedmedia
Getting to be a regular press conference?
@CNN / @Acosta
My son was diagnosed with high functioning Autism a few weeks ago and he's 13. Trumpcare is cheap. Its evil
Bless them
#SickPeopleB4GreedyOldPharts
Advocate for healthcare, not Billionaire tax cuts! People before profit!
You hear us!!!! thank you for fighting 
You should be in California figuring out why Democrats killed Single Payor...FFS
Some times it just feels good to do something when there is no clear path forward. I hope it is a warm evening for you! Bonne courage.
If Corey Booker is there you can bet it's a photo op to be used after...look what we did, we were listening to you. Now you're listening? 
Someone just said that he must be wanting to run for president because avoids issues
Corey Booker is one of the most two-faced I have seen. Didn't start out that way.
Do all that you can to stop this bill. America is depending on you to fight hard for improving ACA.
Save their lives!
36 yr old daughter had stroke preACA.
We paid insurance & all costs til qualified for Medicare.
4 yrs later could work p/t.
Medicare 4 all!
Please, Lord, don't let this bill become law.  Amen.
THIS is exactly what the US need right now! Great job!

Thank you for listening & please know there are many more Americans who will suffer from the GOP's health reduction plan.
How true
#proudtobeademocrat
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE....and this http://tinyurl.com/k9plysn  video has 7 million views #Resist
You are all AWESOME!  Thank you for standing up for the American people!
Glad the weather cooperated with you today, it's a beautiful night in DC.  And Thank You!!
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for caring...#RESIST
Thank you from one of the 22 million!
Thank you for doing this. Stay out there every day. Millions will join you
.@SenateDems .@SenJeffMerkley .@RonWyden THANKS for trying so hard to save #Obamacare.
while you are all there you may want to stop the lunatic from bombing syria again w/o your approval!
March out the kids..pathetic Democrat move. Will not change reality that ACA is dead. Only market forces can fix problem.
#AmericaSpeaksOut 

Thank you for standing up for us. 

This is our story:
I'm terrified by lifetime caps. Meds that cost $10-20,000 per month. Won't take long.

#CelebratingA4ThOfYourLiesTrump: Next Stop Impeachment & Jail Time. Sincerely yours, one combat veteran. 
While you're there, see if that Schoolhouse Rock bill is walking around. Maybe he can teach you how to craft a better bill on your own
So beautiful
Thank you for representing real people. Any GOP there (rhetorical question)?
Take action.
Help those who are innocent living human beings with pre existing conditions!!!  Make it work for us like Obama did! Prayers & Miracles
Senators, Get up, roll your sleeves up and fight. Resist! Do your job!
What if #ACHA is actually a GOOD thing in the long wrong. You've gotta put tea in hot water B4 the flavor comes out.
Maybe #ACHA will end up being a GOOD thing. #SinglePayer 
Please don't approve this healthcare plan. It will destroy America.
Let's put a cap on scoops of ice cream & see how POTUS does.
Instead of sitting on the stairs why aren't you working to come up with something better?  "Resisting"?  Ocare is your fault. Own it.
The government is being actively demolished and my party is sitting around playing believe it not with a freaking flashlight.
Thank you @SenateDems 
#holdthefloor 
#standthesteps
We support you!!
Is that Ted Lieu??
Historic.  Booker, Schumer
Democrats party of evil and corruption!
U dems will take Texas when Hillary is elected president
I don't know a single person who doesn't have a pre-existing condition.
#AmericaSpeaksOut I know people with MS, Diabetes, Bipolar, High BP, A Fib, Migraines, Asthma, HepC, Cerebral Palsy, Downs, Anencephaly...
All debilitating, most deadly, without adequate treatment. And I didn't include the healthy ones who became paralyzed in car accidents.
Did all u dems major in dramatics and bullshit
It should be called #bogus care or #fake care or #taxcareforbillionaires
@realDonaldTrump This should not be necessary in order for 45 to tell Congress to either come up with something better or fix the ACA 
#sad
I love my Senators!!  @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal .
We are healthy but were very grateful for affordable health insurance due to Medicare expansion. Now I'm very afraid for my son and I.
Thank you all who participated stay safe
