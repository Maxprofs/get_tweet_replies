I'm glad you don't want to be re-elected. You learned nothing from Nov 8.

@potus needs his team.Its sad ur holding up the processes. Do u realize if DeVos delivers u lose credibility in 18
do you realize if devos wins we lose our future - our children?look at detroit!
did you actually watch and listen to DeVos' answers, really grizzly bears?puleeeeze!
That's not my job. My job is to vote for the right person to make the right decisions.
it's not your job to be informed? You, trump and his cronies are one and the same!
What part of right person don't u understand? Only have 140 letters minus names silly.
SHAME ON YOU ALL.
Thank you!!!
i don't even have kids and i don't want her approved!! Made calls to my reps & emails... Thx.
As a parent of a child with special needs, this nomination is unjust!  I fear for my daughter's future, her rights.
You can't be serious!
Extreme vetting for trump nominees, but not for those coming from countries where terrorists thrive. #Schumernistas
Public schools are a disgrace and discriminate.  My son expelled from public school since he was a hunter.
You forget  PA turned red this election. We want who Trump wants.  Make it happen instead of ignoring our will.
U must despise low income minority voters who benifit the most from school choice Rich can afford poor can't Shame

Where is @SenToomey..?
You know their is an extensive Private school system in the Philly area which is much better than Public schools.
#SchoolChoice for everyone.  Why would you subject kids to the terrible Public schools in Phila?  Is it the $?

@WestWingWeekly Stackhouse!!!!
Are you going to share the story of the absolute failure of the PSSA and Keystones? #teachtothetest #therealproblem
Ask about my sons story, we need your help.
7 Billion with the Obama administration, no positive results. Time for a new direction. VOTE DeVos.
What are you basing this on? What are her qualifications?
Pls keep up. We are watching and much appreciative. We support you all.
But at the end of it all, she  would be confirmed.. Pennywise pound foolish!!!!
thank you senator!
Thank you! Keep fighting! We need you to be OUR voice and to perserve our CHILDREN's future
Vote for DeVos. Competition is good, everyone will have a choice in how they want to educate their children.
She's ruined MI charter schools, they're ranked 50th in edu standards under DeVos. Look it up
thank you for working hard & standing up for what's right. Please fight against Sessions, too. We have your back!
yay!   Now get the other PA senator Toomey to do what the teachers want.   That was his campaign promise.
give it up.  You are not Mr, Smith goes to Washington
THANK YOU Bob, you INSPIRE all of the people in the USA!
Thank you Senator Casey
don't give up Mr Senator.
Thank you for standing up for America's children and teachers. #holdthefloor
Joke all round
remember, educate, not indoctrinate!
