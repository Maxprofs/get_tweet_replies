What's sick about Cassidy is that he has an M.D. after his name. A sane doctor wouldn't do this.
A sane but desperately greedy doctor might. One who anticipates a big Mercer payoff for services rendered.
Good point. Unfortunately, anyone can get corrupted these days.
I figure people have been corruptable since people existed. These people are sworn public servants who have lost sight of their purpose.
Gee, if only the AMA could revoke his accreditation
That sounds like a good idea.
Even with insurance my meds are costing thousands. If we had Canada’s system my cost would be 75% less
Source?
News flash: healthcare, as we know it today, will be gone. Even for people that have health insurance. Too many HC companies depend on M/M.
thank you
ObamaCare cost Americans a fortune/the insurance companies have all the politicians paid off/we need a medical program like Germany, Canada!
That is depressing considering that every good social program and environmental regulations are being repealed.
Wellllllllll, Trumpcare is going to be so popular. Not!
I can't believe any elected official would vote for Graham/Cassidy bill. 32 million losing healthcare; increased premiums; cuts to Medicaid?
Repeal and replace Obamacare - the Government (Democrats and Republicans) cannot run the VA and they cannot run country wide healthcare.
So Billy are you a Russian sympathizer like Pres. Shit-for-Brains?  Maybe we should repeal your health care first.
@senorrinhatch & @SenMikeLee are you ok with these results?
If it does get passed and signed into law, Americans that wants real change needs to call their provider or HR Dept. and cancel insurance.
GOP elected 2 serve people & country. This serves special interest & trump. Time for all 2 go. Ignore GOP & red ads 2018&2020 flip all BLUE!
Most in Congress have felt the effects of cancer. Given that, how could they vote for a bill that increases treatment costs so drastically?
I don't see productivity happening under so called conservatives. This current administration is going ching ching at our expense. SMH
And to think there are 48 Senators that are okay with this just to "pass" something. Not one of them care at all about people. 2018 folks...
While Senate unanimously commits $700 billion to MORE WAR -ANYTHING TO MAKE WAR. NOTHING FOR PEOPLES' WELLBEING. NO FIGHT AGAINST G.WARMING
Just wish GOP had a moment of honesty (for once) & called this what it truly is: Legalized Genocide. They're Shakespeare's classic idiots.
Enough with these half assed insurance plans. #SinglePayerNow . Vote for DEMOCRATS! If they get the majority @SenSanders will get it passed.
And this
.@ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews Do your job & tell #truth @ repeal! Help save healthcare. #fixACA @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenDeanHeller
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski the GrahamCassidy bill is cruel & will result in needless deaths.  #SaveACA 
Deaths and bankruptcies and people losing their homes and their retirements.
Like I said USA is suppose to care for us.
#Trumpcare
@realDonaldTrump   This is not a great bill. Read this or have someone read it to you, you dope.
Trump wouldn't give a shit if it called for hanging 32 million Americans. All he wants is a win and the Koch brothers 400 million.
And to erase President Obama good work!
So if there will be 50 different health care systems in America, will I need 2purchase HC travel ins to cover me when I leave my state?
let's cut the snake at its head to keep it fr biting back.Boycott Koch Bro companies given they r so brazen with threat of no $ donations.
Easier said than done.
This should be a crime!!
@mikebarnicle for the dodging @GOP
I'll send it to every wavering Senator myself.  As an AMERICAN, I believe I have "standing" as to this vote, as it affects us all
Andy, do you have an up-to-date and comprehensive list of EVERY organization, including the bipartisan group of governors, who oppose this?
The shitty plan being proposed by shitty people is shittier than the shitty plan designed and passed by other shitty people. #singlepayer.
@SenToomey don't even think about it
Can the @GOP possibly believe anyone in their right mind would buy this piece of...
legislation?
#RESIST
Hey, so far, the Republicans are not as bad as Hitler.
FACTS MATTER
3RD TIME NOT CHARMING
Each Rep try at HC is more
destructive!
Strips protections and HC from
millions giving tx brk to wealthy!
@TeamMcCain @JeffFlake  @dougducey sounds pretty bad. You would have to be brain dead or have an alternative agenda to vote for this
Country before party boys
Source this?
Clearly worse than the TrumpCare v1.0 and v2.0. The number of people losing coverage was in the 22-26M range with those. This one is 32M!
Awful!
OMG I don't know how the GOP can even sleep at night. Disgusting excuses for humans
THE CULLING OF THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION / STATE SANCTIONED GENOCIDE... so much for Life Liberty & Pursuit of Happy-ness
congress can approve 700 billion budget for defense surely we can afford to fund the ACA and Medicaid. Affordable healthcare is as important
@senalexander @senbobcorker Here are what the analysts say!  Either vote No now, or wait until CBO looks at it
If this passes for wealthy tax cut, we MUST pass an enormous penance tax on them. 70+% income & estate. Clap back so hard they never forget.
Is there a place I can read these studies and visit the links? Trying to do a deep dive for a newsletter and some strategic stat pushes
@realDonaldTrump Here's an easy quick read for you to use when you tweet about this bill.
My senator wants to kill me. Thank you Lindsay
@LindseyGrahamSC Can't defend the lies after this analysis of yoūr bill. If you stick to your story you have no credibility. Check it ōut.
@LindseyGrahamSC what was that you were saying about pre-existing conditions?
Have to wonder why anyone would want this piece of crap associated with their name. Lindsay Graham shows his true colors with this one.
So, he did lie to Jimmy Kimmel! How can this man, a doctor, be willing to cause so much harm to people?
"The return of annual/lifetime limits would affect the 150 million on employer-provided plans." Thanks for pointing that out.
#NoGrahamCassidy #NoTrumpcare #resist
I think they thought people would be too tired to keep up #TheResistance and would just let it pass...
Free stuff is not a right.
read it & weep folks. Then we get off our butts once again & do something. Keep going. Don't give up. They're counting on it
RESISTANCE, stay at it! Lunar Sea is right, GOP thinks we will give up. Please call every single day.
We should all know they are lying.  They always lie about health care.
I keep wondering what the @GOP line is on how this makes life any better for us?
This is criminal. Disgusting how low our "elected officials" will go to make a buck. Graham, Cassidy and all yes votes should get herpes.
This should be called the Republican Congressional Unemployment Act. If this abomination becomes law the GOP will lose bigly in 2018.
No matter how many people will die @GOP doesn't want to give up 2018 campaign donations from #KochBrothers
Will Lisa Murkowski be courageous enough to do the right thing and just say no to this abomination or will she cave to Koch money?
Sure gave the insurance companies a big old boast to make more money on the back of the poor and seniors along with the rest of the country
@SenatorIsakson,@sendavidperdue, Now explain to GA voters why you are voting for this Bill please!
This terrible bill is really to give their billionaire sugar daddies..ie: Koch, Mercer, etc.. a huge tax cut..take it from working people
Yes!!
If only all the people who would suffer could be Trump voters!  Damn them!
The very kindest thing that can be said about Senator Doctor @BillCassidy at this point is that he might be totally ignorant about his bill.
Of course, if we don't want to accuse Senator Doctor @BillCassidy of being negligent and ignorant, that leaves him being a bald-faced liar.
Can you tweet this to every Senator?
Graham Cassidy health care repeal is DEVASTATING. 
Andy can you tell which independent non partisan outift provided the data and number crunching?
Sources, please.
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC are lying to the American people. Stand up!!! Be counted!!  Call your senator.
What the actual fuck is wrong with these people??
Can you send to @lisamurkowski ?  I think she wants to do due diligence, but she's counting on Trump Admin #s ... (yikes!)
Nit picking but next time make text in narrow newspaper-like columns. Thx
Thanks for the summary. Very informative. Are the Medicaid cuts just a spending cut or are they offset with tax cuts?
You do know Republicans don't care about facts. Only their political future
@SenateGOP what will it take to get you to stop pushing this rushed, incomplete, and counterproductive bill?
More money than the Mercers and Koch Brothers who HIDE behind their money and dont have the balls to run for office but buy those who do.
"non-partisan" ... that's funny. Let me guess, some of them are actually from Conservative sources.
Follow the money someone is benifiting
Jimmy Kimmel knows what he's talking about on this trumpcare mess!
Gross that Cassidy's 17-yr-old pregnant daughter got top #healthcare but he wants to deny others. #ACASavesLives
This is the same BS we went through with Obamacare that you rammed down our throats!! Time to retire old woman
Wow...TrumpDeathCare
This is bizarre, why are they doing this? Has the GOP lost their mind?
The Koch brothers promise of 400 million have turned the GOP into rabid dogs frothing at the mouth to pass death care.
This is repeal of ACA. Trumps cuts ads for ACA enrollment, GOP kills the ACA. Make them pay next election season.
Please make those calls.  Choose 2/3 top concerns. I have a list of 16 I call and it takes about 15 minutes.
We all know when they use the term non-partisan they are just blowing smoke
Given our other senator is @SenToomey is there anything we can do outside the Capitol?
Nononono!! @LindseyGrahamSC & @BillCassidy have ASSURED US ALL REPEATEDLY...that is NOT the case! 
Isn't that right Senators? @MikeBishopMI
Any Senator/Representative voting 4 this MUST tender their resignation immediately. Not a health care bill. @SenCoryGardner @RepMikeCoffman
Or we will tender your resignation for you in 2018.
Those pushing such legislation do not have Americas at the center of their promise delivery system. #economicterrorists
The fact that this is called a "Health Care" bill is a lie. It is a cruel piece of legislation to dismantle H-care for all but wealthy.
@gop @SenateGOP Where would you like us to line up? Put us in a convenient place before you kill us so you don't have to move the bodies.
You know the Nazis did this in World War II. Killed off sick, old and disabled. Is that where the GOP learned it from?
This is really important. Immediate public knowledge critical. (Public fatigue given # times repeal has lost) @ASlavitt most crucial voice.
thank you
Don't worry, @BillCassidy will simply lie through his teeth again and refute it all.

They don't let facts get in the way of their grifting.
They want their Koch Bros. $$$$. They don't care about the American people. They're vile, disgusting men who need to be voted out of office.
Now, you've got it.  The Kochs represent their version of "trickle down" economics. 
Kochs>>>-----$$$------>>> Republican politicians.
That's what it's always been about!!!!
VOTE NO ON #GrahamCasiddy @SenateGOP @JerryMoran @SenJohnMcCain

#ProtectOurCare This is an outlandish proposal
Do you have a list of these links? Since it's a pic, the links aren't preserved. I want to share image but links would be helpful.

Rock and hard place Cassidy is my senator. No did not vote for him.
Showing you lied on @CNN to @ChrisCuomo this morning @BillCassidy not that it is a shock.
Cassidy lied on Jake Tapper too. Then they had a reporter completely discredit everything Cassidy said right after. It was perfect.
OMG this is horrific! I don't understand how anyone could support this cruel, heartless bill. @senrobportman @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski
The GOP are sneaky liars who don't deserve to govern.
Can you cite the sources for this analysis synopsis? I don't doubt what's asserted, but would like to know what non-partisan orgs compiled.
Can't hide from this @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy. You own it so let's hear you try & defend it. #ProtectOurCare
NEW: Graham Cassidy repeal: A series of independent non-partisan analyses have just been released.

Here it is in one place: 
@SenRonJohnson @SpeakerRyan What about this is good for our country or good for our children? You promised better & cheaper. FAR WORSE.
@GovWalker WI needs to come up with $B for FoxConn. How will we deal w/ massive decreases in Fed funding for health? Let ppl get sick & die.
And they want to do this w no hearings or any regular legislative process. What a disgrace. Compare the hearings for the ACA.
Is there a link to share?
All numbers begin 202-224:
Graham 5971
Cassidy 5824
Capito 6472
Murkowski 6665
Collins 2523
Gardner 5941
Flake 4521
McCain 2235
Portman 3353
Please retweet this over and over, it's the clearest thing I've seen on who to call and what number.
Thank you, Jim Murray, for providing these numbers.
I would love to see the detail behind this.
32 million patients. Cruel and heartless.

You have trumps 34% that loving this
Isn't this sick GOP IS KEEPING #ACA

This sucks!
Hey @BillCassidy, guess what:  

#SenCassidyIsALiar
@SenGillibrand. Hint the remaining left. How many people will be off the health care insurance from the Gram-Cassidy bill. 26 million
People. . No results yet. How many people will be off the health care market yet. Guessing
Embarrassing
