President Trump on tax reform: "My plan is for the working people, and my plan is for jobs. I don't benefit" 

Maddening. 
3,000 shipping containers packed with food water & medicene have been sitting at the port in Puerto Rico since Saturday 
But Trump does NOTHING!  Doesn't know they are part of US!  Bet he trots Melanie there next Tuesday!
This man is a bold, flagrant liar. People do not expect to be lied to so directly and consistently. He is a dangerous man; must be stopped.
@realDonaldTrump is the Picasso of con artists
Offer him a deal... his tax cuts for a single payer healthcare system.
Why not?
My comment has nothing to do with Casey's comment...... try again.
Thank you Sen Casey!
Middle finger for the working man
He's never done anything that hasn't been to his benefit.  Trump is for Trump and no one else.
You're gone next year pal.
He lies again.  It's his M.O.
It's another Shell Game.  How many poor and lower income people can we FOOL THIS Time?
Trump never does anything that doesn't benefit him and that's a fact.
Why does trump lie so blatantly ? Because he thinks we're stupid or does he have an agenda?
You're surprised by him lying through his teeth??
Liar!!!
@realDonaldTrump release your tax returns today
So it's a LIE. Why is that word so difficult
i'm glad he actually said that; because now, when we examine the bill, we will see just how big a liar he is
How 'awkward' for Trump - we have no idea just how much he'll benefit. That should be a key component first - see his taxes. #conflict
you're a liar, and plutocrats don't reinvest.
Yes it us, as usual.
He might be telling the truth. Hasn't paid in the past and won't in the future.
@realDonaldTrump is #liar and #crazyinWhiteHouse  Why do you think he would tell the truth?
Sure...

Heard about robots?  Self-driving trucks?  Online shopping?  Wake up!
When he speaks I leave the room. Why? Lies, lies,and more lies . #25thAmendmentNow
Me too. Cannot stand lying
All lies
Of course he doesn't benefit. He doesn't pay taxes.
Enough with the class warfare BS. Government is currently consuming 33% of our GDP. In 1900 it was 7%. YOU are the problem
Same old talking points, the Democrats are happy with over taxing the middle class
GOP=Greedy Old Party
what a concept, a president putting forth a law that has no personal benefit to himself. he's just such a fount of giving, what a guy!! #Oy
Somebody wake Bob up. Trump has said since he campaigned that he would reduce corporate taxes.
Trump is such a bold-faced liar! It would be a joke if his base didn't buy into his BS!
It's hard to watch him speak.... and will he stay on prompter
He doesn't benefit because maybe he doesn't pay taxes?
Liar liar, pants on fire!      #DotardDonnie you don't fool those who will be paying more in taxes! #GaslightingAmerica
Trump saying something untrue? The hell you say.
He will not stop lying. And his defenders will not stop DEFLECTING!
#TrumpLies #ImpeachTrump #DotardTrump
Tweeting isn't gonna cut it. Gotta be publicly vocal w/examples of results of previous Repub tax policies. Contrast Dem results 1945-80.
@DisTrumpia @NBCPolitics The Dump benefits from everything he does. He's a liar
Trump lying  again! Claims he doesn't benefit from #TaxReform ! Show us your tax returns!
He never does anything that doesnâ€™t benefit him
It is easy to know when Trump is lying. His lips are moving.#ImpeachTrump
Bob 
Simply not true is not proof ...where's your proof that the President is wrong
Casey just 
He lies as much as he breathes...
@realDonaldTrump is a serial liar and a con man
Trump only lies. Reflex for him.  Pathetic dotard
I'm surprised you are whining? You mean you are not for it?  Especially when you say it screws the middle class!
You benefit, too. That's the whole point. Trying to turn this idea on end only makes you look silly. What have you done for taxes? 
Instead of giving the rich and corporations big tax breaks create more demand by giving everyone else more $ to spend.
Exactly
He just lies like the rest of us breathe.
...and the fear mongering begins...economic theory be damned, right Senator??
Bob, are you implying that Trump is being untruthful?  Our Christian POTUS would never lie to us! He is all about self-sacrifice. #Sarcasm
Yes he is implying that....but unfortunately Boob has no proof..
Has T even seen the plan? As is, he benefits "BIGLY." The lowest bracket will pay more, Middle class w 3 or more children will be CRUSHED.

Just another of the less than truthful statements from trump..solid 95% of the time.
Newsflash: big corporations hire > lower unemployment > increase disposable income > increase spending at other businesses > #biggerpicture
@NBCPolitics If it came out of Trumps mouth it's a LIE! #ImpeachTrump & GOP!
Republicans have no shame and no soul.
#LiarInChief
So we should listen to you? 
You've done nothing for the middle class or lower class
BS served up warm, stinking & thoroughly disgusting. Middle Class & Working Class Trumpies, he's just not that into you!!
Trump lies?  No way.  Lol
He is so full of...well, you know what he is full of.
Perhaps he could show us his tax returns?
Get money
More of the same old lies.
Right, but @SenBobCasey, the difference is he names working class people. Dems stick to the generic 'middle class.' Tell'm how it really is.
@realDonaldTrump "since I lied abt #DrainTheSwamp it's time to feed it's occupants. U didn't really trust me did ya?" #Grifter-in-Chief
I'm curious what you and @SenToomey  talk about when you run into each other
And we don't know if he benefits until we see his taxes
Well be sure to introduce an amendment to exempt the DJT estate from the elimination of the estate tax.
Singling out individuals is illegal...individual discrimination...nice try lol
Stop slaughtering America's Wild and Domestic Equines
This cannot be bought by a lying President that lies to the American people everyday how ignorant does he think we are
There is only one particular president that will benefit from this tax reform thats him his mafia and his thugs of billionaires
And Republicans are even dumber thinking if they cut corporate tax it will get back to consumers instead of CEO's bonus
Wow that took you a whole what day to start firing up BULLSHIT you know who that corporate tax cut will benefit me that's who
And just so you know I'm not surprised super rich either you dick head unlike you who made his money on the backs of others
You do nothing you're produced nothing you contribute nothing you are a nothing Bobby go away already no one cares about you
And we don't know if he benefits or not, since we haven't seen his (probably filled with illegal stuff) taxes. Mueller knows, though.
In other words a play from the usual GOP playbook.
Tbf, he probably doesn't even know or understand the plan.
