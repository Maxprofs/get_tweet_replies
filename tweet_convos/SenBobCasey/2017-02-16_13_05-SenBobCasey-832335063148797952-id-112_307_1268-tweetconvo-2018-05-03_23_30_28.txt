Thank you for fighting for clean water.
What will Trump do when people get sick and die from polluted water? Remember Flint!!!!
Democrats like @SenBobCasey ran Flint. @realDonaldTrump
No, that would be the republican governor who appointed the financial manager that caused the Flint water crisis
Who was a Democrat as well. @SenBobCasey
I think you are ignoring the republican in charge...his pick, his decisions, so his responsibility.
Nice try. Pick up your parting gift on the way out, snowflake.
Ah, very sorry, I didn't realize you are a pass the buck person.
You're an indoctrinated idiot.
Thank you Senator Casey. I wish the rest of the Senate believed as you do.
this is ironic since #Pittsburgh has experienced not 1 but 2 water advisories in 2017 already. #WeNeedtheEPA
Thanks for voting against it!
thank you.. and that is why you have my Pa vote....
. @SenBobCasey Please also explain to 45 & co that coal jobs are never coming back to NEPA. Signed, proud but realistic Coal Cracker
Thank you Senator, we need to stop this trainwreck!!!
Thank you sir.
@KathyDu19806035 @realDonaldTrump Thank you @SenBobCasey
Thank you, @SenBobCasey!

Thank you Senator Casey.
I've watched the Conemaugh River go from completely orange to now being blue/green. Don't let it go back 20 yr
Thank you, sir.
Thank you Senator Casey! Fight for the better of the people - not like Repubs who put party 1st #resist
so will #pollutingPruitt! Vote NO on #scottpruitt for the EPA @SenToomey
Thank you, Senator Casey.
Rick Saccone 2018
why does this need to be a partisan issue.  Polluted water affects everyone
thank you!!
Thank you Senator! We appreciate you consistently resisting DJT and the republican agenda!
no brainer clean air is right
Miners need to know that these rules did not cost heir jobs.  It was mine owners greed.  Will the mines reopen
Thank you
Thank you!! I like my water clean... Orange is bad!
thanks Sen. Casey! Keep fighting and so will we!
Thank You.. on behalf of myself, my children & future generations.. WE thank you!!
Thank you, Casey! @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump This is unacceptable and irresponsible. This man is dangerous to our planet. #ImpeachTrump
Thank you Senator for protecting our children's environment. People before profit. No on Pruitt.
did you protect Pa Citizens water during @POTUS44 ? Fracking allowed their water to light on fire in Dimock!
obstruction politics strategy will be your demise! Be a respected leader like your father was #independent
You voted in hate, not virtue. Staving people so you can seem righteous is false.
Thank you Senator!
let's talk about how you sold your soul to Soros. You're a fraudster
Thank you; now how r u going 2 handle the attack on women in PA?
Thanks, Senator Casey. @SenBobCasey @ezrateach @realDonaldTrump
but you vote for fracking. 
Senator, what is your plan to introduce a clean water initiative to fix that bill?  We drink water!! Thank you
you voted for the UNAFFORDABLE care act.  It raised my family's costs by $2,000 ayear...
Thank you Senator Casey!!
Thank you
. Today?  @realDonaldTrump People should trump profits!
Omg thank you @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump needs to be #impeached, his administration #investigated. What's your plan to accomplish this?
we in Pennsylvania love you Sen Casey
Thank you Sen Casey for your vote. Do republicans not have children? How can they not care about clean water?
thank you for taking a stand against them
So why weren't you behind Bernie when he said we should lift the cap on FICA? Please explain yourself.
you do know Trump won Pa. You may lose your seat if you keep voting against him
what bill is that, Senator?
sure there's some anti liberty repercussion you're not talking about naturally
thank you Senator for trying to work for the health of our world, don't stop please
@Nerrh @realDonaldTrump thanks
Again THANK YOU Bob Casey
Of course you did Senator Groundhog, because you hate American Workers!
So, when all the cancer blooms start happening in Appalachia, are my taxes going to go up for their med. care?
way to go Senator Casey! Need your support for NEA too! #NEA
Thank you!...what more can we do!
Why do you hate miners? You buy stock in unreliable wind turbines? @realDonaldTrump
Senator Groundhog hates all American workers, not just miners.
is there anything that WE can do to help/prevent?
Thank you @SenBobCasey for taking a stand!
Thank you Senator Casey for standing up for us.
Sen Rand Paul-75% of coal country in Kentucky voted for Trump - what % of coal country in PA voted for Trump?
Press Conference - there was Senator Manchin, Coal Miners and Enviromentalist - no Senator Casey ?.
@Sen_JoeManchin has voted to confirm 2unacceptable Trump appointees. Defeat Punish nov 2018
I hope Senate dems established a record during debate that can be used when the new law is challenged in court.
thank you Senator Casey for standing up for the people!
Of course you VOTED against it.  Wonder is PA Coal Miners feel the same.
thank u senator
Air and water are very important to our sustainability.
thank you @SenBobCasey for caring and voting no
@stateofemotions
If you have ever worked an environmental project, you would know the regulations need to be simplified.
Thank you Sen. Casey
thank you Sen. Casey!! Now if only @PatToomey had your integrity to vote to protect PA and our water sources
So the trump voters in PA will start drinking polluted water. KARMA
Yeah yeah yeah... @realDonaldTrump
Thank you Senator Casey. @SenToomey
Thank you, again!
can  you  please  explain,. Or  as  usual  want  to create confusion. since dems senators are  anarchist
If they want to pull this crap, go do it in Russia. I'm sure they will accept them with open arms.
trump does not care about people or the environment
Atta boy Bobby!  You're doing great.  Your puppet masters must be proud of your obedience!
Harry Reid gave his lapdog to Schumer as a going away present.  @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
Agreed!  Hand picked by Reid and Schumer so he follows them like a little puppy.
so you think it's okay to control small steams that dry up in summer and call them navigable waterways?really?
The Republicans seem to think they can slip by any old bills. Not in my country you won't!! We will fight!!!!!
The irony is that sludge is going to get dumped into Trump supporters drinking water.
the water here is already spotty. It's clear @SenToomey doesn't care about us
to me is Pennsylvania's Traitor
toomey is PA Traitor
not to me. Love Toomey.
Thanks for trying, Senator!
duly noted but is there anything else you can be doing to stop Pruitt from getting in?
wait, you tried to preserve the Earth? BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BILLIONAIRES? Jk, thanks Senator Casey. You > Toomey
Thank you!
At least you have this country's interests at heart @SenBobCasey unlike your creepy compatriot @SenToomey
thank you Senator.
it's really sad
