Hooray for politicians that are aware they work for the people and not their own self interests!!
Don't trust anyone who is linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam, go tell others, too.
as a constituent, thank you for hearing me and representing me in our government.
Tell @SenToomey, who appears to care more about his $55,800 donation from DeVos than his constituents!
Since @SenToomey shut off his phones, could you find our wayward Senator & relay a message from the people of PA? #NoonDeVos
So tell @SenToomey.
you don't speak for PA voters you speak for the teachers union you hack
You bet! Keep pushing.
Can you help convince Toomey?
This is key! Toomey needs to separate donations from decisions.  Nothing should be conditional.
Don't trust anyone who is linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam, go tell others, too.
VOTE NO! Even if she'd been picked by a DEM she is still unqualified for the position. Tell @SenToomey !
Can you convince Toomey to listen to his constituents? Isn't he working for us, too? Thank you, @SenBobCasey !!
Well put, @SenBobCasey.
#resist
I, and more importantly my constituents, are not satisfied with the evasive answers from Betsy DeVos. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/02/01/the-good-evasive-and-very-bad-answers-betsy-devos-gave-to-questions-from-democrats-about-education/ â€¦
does it honestly boil down to answers or. $$ let's me honest for once
I'm satisfied. You should vote yes. @PSEA may give you money, but 2.9 million Pennsylvanians think you should
can you help convince @PatToomey since you share the same constituents (me included)???
thank you for listening. Unfortunately, Sen Toomey is not!
Evasive is being too kind. She clearly showed her ignorance of public education.
Right!!! No experience, won't enforce Title IX, and who thinks guns anywhere inside a school is a good idea!!!!
yes we are not! Vote no to DeVos!

Don't trust anyone who is linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam, go tell others, too.
Don't trust anyone who is linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam, go tell others, too.
how about informing Toomey cause we're his constituents too but he's hiding!!
screw this obfuscation strategy of Trump's appointees - SO OVER IT!
Thank you, Senator. All DeVos is capable of teaching us is that money is more important than qualifications.
Funny, neither are @SenToomey which he'd know if his staff answered the phone or he read his faxes.
nor are we satisfied with evasive actions of #sentoomey #TuesdaysWithToomey
Don't trust anyone who is linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam, go tell others, too.
@SenToomey, I respectfully ask 4UR #NoVote
@hickeyhouse15 @washingtonpost just say no!
NO
NO
NO
I like her. I think I'm one of your constituents but you wouldn't know it the way I'm spoken to by your office.
I recall that Loretta Lynch didn't answer most  questions.I thought she was too smooth as I watched. She was.
thank you senator!
That's amazing! All of your constituents are of ONE mind? No one disagrees with you? You won with 100% of the vote? Interesting
Don't tell us she's learned your method of dodging the questions and spinning half truths.
and I'm not happy with over priced public schools that are failing. Look at Philadelphia as an exame.
thank you now convince Toomey not to put our education system in jeopardy
you dont say? luckily for the public nothing will be done about it and we can celebrate cronyism once more.
Thank you Senator.  She isn't remotely qualified for that post and would be a disaster for public education
those who stand up to Trump and his nominees will not be forgotten by the people who asked for help
please stand up for us and our children don't approve this women. You know it's the right thing to do.
so glad that at least one of our senators thinks we matter
building the wall between dems and republican bob? Not what we elected you too do. Remember who pays salary!
Or Rick Perry? Ben Carson? THESE choices you're cool with but Betsy DeVos is the worst? Seriously, stop punking democracy.
But Rex Tiller gave you some great ones, eh? And Sessions? And every other garbage hack Trump picked? You can't pick and choose
well if you can't speak to current situations in education how can you be put in charge of it?
Does she even know what a number 2 pencil is and how it can be used as a weapon?
please find an impeachable offense to nail trump with.
@valeriestrauss ..This nominee should receive a NO vote for the sake of all of us. Please, follow through w/this,Senator.3)
@valeriestrauss ..is cheating!& she knows nothing about the Ed system. Our children would suffer & consequently our country 2)
@valeriestrauss Evasive answers & proof she has the morals of a snake. Don't we teach our children not to cheat? Plagiarizing1)
Watched biased/convoluted/disrespectful questions to DeVos & am appalled. Questions were evasive.  Answers good
what are you going to do?
thank u senator hope @SenToomey feels the same way
PLEASE encourage Senator Toomey to vote No on DeVos.  I'm a constituent from Butler County, PA.
Correct, Senator Casey. Too bad your colleague @SenToomey doesn't care what Pennsylvanians think.
from district 13, keep up the pressure senator Casey!!!!!
Thanks for listening to our calls and emails, Senator. Hopefully you can get Sen. Toomey to do the same.
thank you for standing up for education in PA 
#VoteNoDevos #DeVosvote
vote no
unqualified! Not good for education! Bad choice! Refilling the swamp with big money! Bad very bad!
#noDevos @SenToomey It is imperative you bring someone in/w the knowledge to run our ed. system. Not Devos
gone in 2018
ur opinion doesn't matter. Ur suppose to vote on what ur constituents want. U didn't c the election results.
Can we bring Pat Toomey along?
dear senator, ms de vos really disqualified herself and is too hostile vs accountability & equality. 

tyvm.
do you know where @SenToomey is? Will he pick up the phone for you? He's made it impossible to reach him with our opinion
Thank you for listening to us! #VoteNoOnBetsyDeVos
I have called both my senators (Grassley
and Ernst) and urged them to vote no...slim chance but I tried.
Tell Toomey we got a go fund me set up to buy his vote, because apparently he only listens to $$$
.@SenBobCasey Not qualified. Counting on you voting no! @mcall @washingtonpost
did @SenToomey get my email?
thank you for voting no!!  I'm happy to have you representing us! Keep fighting. #RESISTANCE #StopDeVos
plz tell Toomey to vote NO!
Any chance you've spoken to @SenToomey? Been trying to call him all week re:DeVos, but phone lines all busy or voicemail full
Thank u @SenBobCasey ! 1000s of Pennsylvanians are also dissatisfied w/@SenToomey. Our kids need him 2 save their schools fr DeVos & VOTE NO
Thank you Senator Casey!  As a PA voter I support your NO vote on DeVos. How about you, @SenToomey?
thank you for fighting and listening to us!     get @SenToomey to do same!
Thank you for all of your hard work, you're a beacon of hope amid all the turmoil!
Interesting. Hey @SenToomey, guess who has the same constituents!
.@SenBobCasey thanks for your leadership again on this issue!! You are representing PA's wishes. No to #devos #DeVosvote #DeVosHearing
We. . . me, have been wanting someone in education like this for years.  Casey is done in PA.
Trump could have picked anyone for this. His teams is smart. She is qualified.  Dems stalling.
Qualified to lead the Dep of Edu based on what...her ability to plagiarize?Buy her way in??
Her leadership in school & program development. Plus, @realDonaldTrump picked the best. Trust, I will
Yeah she lead the Detroit schools right down the toilet. Good luck with that.
Detroit went down the toilet.  8 of 10 kids in poverty.  She saved some of it.
No she did not! Her charter schools did nothing and were worse than the public schools .
She received as much praise as criticism.  Criticism comes cheap.  Many success stories.
@mcall @washingtonpost Please sup HSLF comprehensive legisltv agenda for 2017.I will carefully watch ur record on these issues!
Thanks. Now how about Sessions?
I've watched the so called "gotcha" tactics with DeVos. Trump picked her, she will pass.
Thanks Senator Casey, DeVos would destroy the Dept of Ed. Highly unqualified
thank you for having a spine unlike that invertebrate @SenToomey,  she did give him $55,000 for the endorsement after all
Thx for listening to us. Your fellow PA @SenToomey doesn't seem to know he works for residents of PA. Tell him
I am satisfied that she's unqualified for the position. #Constituent
Nothing is going to make you guys happy.  I'm disgusted with the lot of Democrats.  Never voting "D" again.
thank you for voting no. Maybe you can talk to @SenToomey , if he will take your calls. All ph#s busy for me.
Why is Toomey supporting her?
pls reach across to @SenToomey -we have been calling, writing, faxing, but it has been challenging to get thru w/ busy lines.
Don't trust anyone who is linked to the Amway mafia-like MLM scam, go tell others, too.
Thank You. Let @SenToomey know how we feel. Voters here in PA have long memories. WesternPA is watching
YES. Thank you for supporting PA's families and children
Thanks, Senator. You talk a good game on Twitter; I'm pleased to see you backing it up with your vote on this.
Thank you for standing up for PA kids!  @SenToomey - I'm pleading with you again, please don't do this to our kids!  Be brave!
Thank you!!!
You should be more concerned about UC Berkeley BC our schools lost it.
wake up Casey PA went RED    VOTE Yes for Betsy             and 2018 you want in or Out
Thanks for standing up for what's right. Hoping your colleague @SenToomey does the same.
Thank you. Lead Bravely.  We are paying attention.
plz encourage your #GOP counterparts to vote #No on #devos
thank you for defending our educational system
