If it ain't single payer, it ain't worth the paper it's printed on.
Thank you, Senator Casey!
The Republican plan to take care from the most vulnerable and working poor is a cruel & heartless plan.
By "getting it right," you mean even more draconian cuts to the old, poor, & disabled?
We need Medicare for everyone.
and some how were going to view u out in 2018 Casey
THANK YOU @SenBobCasey THANK YOU for being the courage others shd be when bullies try to rule
Sen Casey why not try and fix and improve O-care? But no, continue being an obstructionist
Not a scheme, Senator, with all due respect. The scheme was ObamaCare: to steal our rights!
#wrong
This is just bananas. Doesn't anybody have any other tasks for this guy to do? One trick pony. #inept
.@SenBobCasey @cramer_j @SpeakerRyan @washingtonpost & we'll keep calling, writing, protesting, & voting. GOP is a dead party. DT killed it
You and the #FreedomCaucus keep at him.  We don't want #Ryancare.
and we will vote you out. In case you haven't noticed, PA is a red state now. Go @PatMeehanPA
@TuesdaysToomey @SpeakerRyan Single Payer Now! @BernieSanders @NationalNurses #MedicareForAll @SSWorks
Way to go Senator!!!!
what are you doing to help expensive unusable insurance called Obamacare?
Thank you for fighting for the American people Senator. You are our hero! Ryan and @gop is pure evil.
Thank you Senator. PA needs you. Also, Medicare for All should be the next step.
hell no. Not affordable.
that's why we don't vote for you @SenBobCasey
Pat Meehan for PA senate 2018. Vote out the obstructionists.
YOU voted for obamacare that has jeopardized our healthcare. You ARE a hypocrite! @SpeakerRyan
uh u'll be out on the street pal.
.@SenBobCasey.@SpeakerRyan are u listening #PatriotsNeeded #WhatareyouWaitingFor #IndependentCommission #SpecialProsecutor #GorsuchVoteLater
Why a shocker??  Ryan's anti ACA, anti Medicare, anti Social Security and anti anything else that help people!
please do oppose @SpeakerRyan.  He's an immoral liar who'll cause more American suffering and deaths than any terror group.
@TuesdaysToomey @SpeakerRyan @washingtonpost Be on the offense. Write a bill for single payer. It's the only viable ACA replace
Please do.
call @realDonaldTrump 's bluff and propose sensible changes / improvements to ACA then work with moderates to get it through
thank you senator!  Proud to be your constituent!
single payer for all!
he wants to Back up Potus, his party is against Health care and afraid of electoral suicide
investigate Trump Russian ties!  We demand an independent investigation!!
independent council to investigate Trump's Russian ties!!!!!
What donors? Why are donors and a retreat needed to pass a healthcare bill? What's going on here?
Instead of speaking with donors, you might want to hold a town hall like @SenBobCasey or something.
Shocker is PA is suffering everywhere budget. Education, drugs...so what is your plan to make a change Bob?
Why are they so hell bent on screwing over us average Americans? I just don't get it.
everyone wants a free ride and hard working folks get screwed over. So wrong
thank you, Senator, for fighting this. Agree with Medicare for all. Ryan, et al do not have a clue.
thank you
remember it was a scheme when you pushed last time.
thank you, happy to have you as my senator
Not going to happen...face the facts. You were trying to screw us by giving the rich & insurance companies breaks.
Ryan is working to be the scapegoat.  Wonder how much he'll make from trump?
why wont you HELP make a better plan instead of waiting to fight something that may actually work? That's sad!
Thank you @SenBobCasey.  What about you @SenToomey?
Thank you, @SenBobCasey ! We have your back in #MontgomeryCounty PA!
You be da man Bobby ==PC perfect always
thank you for your continuing fight for health care justice. #ACA
Shocker: and we'll keep fighting back!
They need to repeal it they would eat nails to repeal it That way the big orange cancer can rant
Briefing donors? Are you freaking kidding? You work for the people @SpeakerRyan, not the donors. #naive
Right on, Senator Casey. #ACA
while I’m no fan of the Ryan bill I’d love to hear how you’d go about fixing some of the problems with ACA Senator
Step One: vote out Conservative Republicans  and then Democrats and moderate Republicans can work together sans obstruction
reality is far left poses the same problem for Dems in moving any moderate legislation forward
Thank you @SenBobCasey. I hope your boldness continues to grow. 

@SpeakerRyan
look bob as I live here in PA how about working with them for the changes needed instead of waiting to oppose
My guess is that Ryan will be gone before you are, @SenBobCasey
Thank you. PA 11 constituent. No on Gorsuch also. Too many unanswered questions with executive branch. Vote 2018!
#scheme"   LOVE IT!
this is why we can't get any progress out of Washington. Fighting gets nowhere. Negotiating is what u are to do!
thank you Senator Casey I will keep fighting it too, and his misguided plans for more tax cuts to rich
Pat Meehan said 2day he was a firm no ! Remind him if this comes back around!
Thank You, Senator Casey! PA needs you!
thank you Senator Casey. Keep up the fight, we are with you all the way.
would like to see a public option for those who can't get coverage in the free market due to no companies covering
This is part of what needs to be fixed.  Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.
Healthcare "scheme" or healthcare "scam"?
@SpeakerRyanthis is where we've failed in this country. Pic of politicians family with vulgarity. Very tolerant
like his boss he likes flogging dead horses
Got  get 'em, Casey!  U're making us proud!
ryan may continue as a private citizen because he compromised his trust enabling nunes obstruct
abandon the notion of "health insurance". we aren't rich/poor cars, we aren't good/bad drivers #fairtax #betterway
speaker Ryan you giving up your lifetime insurance to buy what we get.
that goes for Casey and the rest of government also.
Donors! He's briefing donors on yet more killer crap developed in secret. GOP donors are more important than lives
please support Bernie Sanders' Medicare for all bill.
His hatred for Americans is adorable.
He wants the money for idiotic TAX CUTS!!!!!!!
Now work on indicting Sessions for perjury & demanding that Nunes recuse himself.  ENOUGH BS!  US deserves better!
Tell Ryan to keep and fix what we have.  Thank You
your not in the house stupid
