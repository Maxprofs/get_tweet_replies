Wish your counterpart @PatToomey would do this. Haven't been able to get through at all.
I was able to get through to a @SenToomey staffer on the toll-free number to the Bethlehem office today. (855) 552-1831
For your one completed call, I've made hundreds of calls to all offices - to no avail. #shameful #dumptoomey
We just need to keep it up. I've been sending emails, too. They are effective.
Me too!  Trying every approach I can. Don't have the $60k+ it presumably takes. #sad
Power in numbers. Make sure to call your representative as well to put pressure on an investigation into Trump's ties to Russia.
Mark Pocan (D-WI) has suggested impeaching Trump called his office to tell him I support that idea 202-225-2906
Do you live in his district? If not, what was the response? A lot of them won't log calls unless a constituent.
This is what CASEY does---keeps a FULL voicemail
ok so what can I do for you??????????
In my experience your phone is always busy and your voice mail always full, Same with Toomey,
MY experience- that CASEY's phones are sent to VOICEMAIL I can always get through to Toomey.
Thanks for checking in, Mrs. Toomey. I & many other peons can never get through to #BoughtAndPaidForPat @Deogratias93 @SenToomey @jdprose
You are WELCOME.  SIlly boy!  THANKS FOR THE COMIC RELIEF!
maybe you can help @SenToomey out with his phones. Something seems amiss there. #canyouhearmenow
I DOUBT IT.I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU THE MANY MANY times his office would not answer thephone only voicemail
@Celeste_pewter Hey can you go down the hall and help @SenToomey with his phones? He seems to have forgotten they exist.
I find JUST the OPPOSITE. Casey's office puts you on answ. machine or does not answer!
@tedcruz @JohnCornyn To my TX representatives: TAKE A LESSON from Bob Casey!
If they do, they will not answer the phone!  I get an ANSWERING machine when I call!
Thanks. We know U try. Isakson took down his quick email in the mid of my response today! Chicken!
as a Pennsylvania resident and a Trump voter I'm asking you to please vote Yes for the Supreme Court Justice
I am with Karen's  sane mind!
thank you so much for setting the example & listening to your constituents' concerns!
I can't get through on the phone.  I get the answering machine. It seems Casey answers to only certain issues!
interesting. I've gotten through every time.
Thank you for having our backs!  We have yours. You and your staff have been fantastic. This is not the time for compromise.
I can hardly wait to vote you out!
ME too !  We have to pray and work HARD to get CASEY out. He is not like his father!
Vote to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court!
Finally ---A sane mind (@acebb20 ) in the group!
Hey @SenToomey, are you taking notes? How To Answer a Phone 101 with Prof. @SenBobCasey
I don't answer my phone at home when someone wants to talk crazy and swear at me
??? Not going to swear or yell. I'm asking Toomey to answer his phone at work so I can voice my opinion quickly & respectfully
too bad, @SenToomey doesn't give crap about acknowledging his constituents.
NO, I get a real person when I CALL Toomey-- BUT NOT WHEN CALLING CASEY!
Please confirm all of trump's cabinet, and stop playing partisan politics.
THANK YOU! Finally a SANE mind on this tweet!!!!!!!! CASEY is NOT like his father!
need to go away in 2018. Repeal and replace you so to speak.
I am WITH you!  Casey is not like his dad!  AND his office does not answer phones when he does not agree with you
can you go answer @SenToomey's phone?
Well, in my experience with the CASEY office, they DON'T answer their own phones!!!!  FRUSTRATING!
Sorry, vote no for Toomey and Marino 
 The ARE NOT for PA voters. Can't even get them to respond. Remember this in 2018
Well then the same holds for CASEY BECAUSE his office does not answer the phone when they don't want to
@SenateDems I say suspend all senators that boycott without pay. Until they SHOW up & do their job.
Thank you for being there for your constituents.  @SenToomey has been avoiding them! #NoBanNoWall #noDevos
He is rarely there for us in PA who call him!  I get an answering machine! TRULY frustrating.........
HEY! I find this NOT true because I am a regular caller to his offices (D.C.) and I get voicemail.Rarely a real person!
bow do we begin impeachment of Trump and get Bannon out of the NSC?
thank you from the bottom of my heart
Its nice to see one Senator doing his job! PS voters remember this in 2018! Vote No on Toomey and Marino! They are for us!!
@SenateDems funny... I tried calling Cornyn and Cruz all day and of course, no one answers and box is full. They don't care...
Sounds  like when I call CASEY AND I CALL him REGULARLY ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES.!
Thanks for answering your phones.  I've tried over 30 times to reach Toomey and only reached an answering machine once.
Sounds like when I call CASEY with other issues!
Hey @SenToomey Talking to constituents (like @SenBobCasey is) is also part of your job. PICK UP YOUR PHONE! #noDevos #pickupthephone
PICK UP YOUR PHONE, BOB CASEY!!!!!!!  BOB CASEY needs to answer ALLLLL the time!
@SenateDems ALL phone calls into the whitehouse have been Busy! No way to get in to anyone!
Sounds like when I call CASEY"S office!
TRUE!  I wish Casey were like his father!
@SenToomey Please vote NO to Betsy DeVos.   Senator Toomey, I voted for you.  Please don't let Pennsylvania teachers down.
senator Toomey, Betsy DeVos is exactly what we need as the head of our Department of Education vote Yes
Thank you!

@caitiecait21 On the other hand, Sen Rubio's voice mailbox has been full for days.
Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI) has suggested impeaching Trump Just called his office to support that idea.  
202-225-2906
Thank you for taking care of your constituents!!!!
confirm them all and fast. Yours Truly, Washington and Greene Counties.
Thank you for this! As a longtime resident of DC, I don't have any senators. May I adopt you?
Shout out to all of the aides answering the phones. They have been professional and polite.
@PADems better add some phone lines. And I hope you hear the message. Stand strong
you rock Senator Casey.  Keep fighting.    Impeach trump
Thank you for for caring so much about your constituents and letting their voices be heard! It's refreshing!!
Senator I'm making calls half the day every day. Thank you for standing up for AMERICANS.
Maybe you could show Toomey how it's done!
Thank you for standing up to nominees.  I'm concerned about all of them but especially deVos right now. Vote no

much better than your opponent @PatToomey @SenToomey he's not even trying! You have next election in the bag if you #keepitup
thank you.  We can't say the same for your colleague Pat Toomey.  Who is showing us what a slime ball he is
Robert Reich with same questions 68 million of us have. Democrats Must Fight https://youtu.be/LDNnPgAVpJY  via @YouTube
Thanks Senator Casey.  Maybe  @SenToomey should learn some lessons on how to treat his constituents.
Thank you! Wish @SenToomey could say the same - no one's getting through.
@SenateDems Thanks for taking calls. McConnell @SenateMajLdr hides from his constituents by not answering or turning on vm.
thank you for making time to hear your constituents. Hey @SenToomey this is what doing your job looks like.
HA! Thank you Senator! Pls encourage your other Dems to fight against SCOTUS pick. Dem base will have your back if you do!
Thank you, you are appreciated
- Please tell @SenToomey - that they should be doing the same. #blockdevos
.@SenBobCasey Pls keep fighting!
thank you for answering your phone. Too bad @SenToomey can't manage to do the same.
Good! Tell your colleagues to clear their mailboxes!
Can you maybe send some help over to @SenToomey?
@SenateDems now if the Republicans would do the same, we might get some true bipartisanship.
please get your colleague Toomey to respond to his constituents
Demand that Bannon not be appointed to NSA
Thank you for being responsive to your constituents! Any chance you can convince @SenToomey to change his vote on DeVos?
I strongly urged you and your colleagues to stand up and fight back scream for trump legality investigation
thank you Senator!!
@SenateDems Vote no on DeVos,
@SenateDems Thanks for being accountable to Pennsylvanians. #VoteNoDevos and tell @SenToomey to take a stand for once.
Any chance you can lean on @SenToomey about DeVos? #OneMoreNo
toomey is unreachable...thank you @SenBobCasey  for all you do... #noDevos
tell your buddy pat to pick up!
I’d prefer if you tried getting some GOP support against DeVos.
Thank you. I have faxed.
While I liked your white-tie and tails look better, do keep it up, sir!
@dinkydo1 do something about trump dangerous man. Impeach now
Thank you!
maybe you could teach some of your colleagues to do the same
Block and Filabuster any SCOTUS pick by Trump. Our future is in your hands. #illegitimatepresident #resist
Did Trump just lift the Russian Sanctions?
So  Donald Trump  just lifted sanctions against Russia's FSB cyberspying @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/cyber_gl1.pdf …
@SenateDems what r we doing about republicans just putting every nomination through
Awesome
@SenateDems THANK YOU FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON DEVOSS!
At this point just picking up the phone make you look 100x better than your colleague. Low bar, but thx for clearing it anyway
@SenateDems please please please call in whatever favors you can to stop DeVos.  Do it for the children of PA.
Thank you. If only someone @SenToomey would answer...or at least empty their voicemail.
can you ask @SenToomey to do the same?
So why haven't Impeachment proceedings begun, it is not like enough evidence hasn't already been gathered.
@SenateDems goods things can happen in Scranton especially if you endorse trumps ed sec
you should help @SenToomey do the same! I think some people want to talk to him about his #Devos vote.
If you can find the time, then @SenToomey and his staff can. NO to DeVos!!!
you are a better man than @SenToomey. It is nice to see a man with such dedication to the people he represents.
@SenateDems #ImpeachTrump #Trumprussia
your staffer Gordon in Pittsburgh was a very nice young man. Thank you for your work! #StopSessions
get on the floor and support @SenMariaCantwell in her debate to keep the #StreamProtectionRule fight #HJres38
Unlike @SenToomey, who's phones have been taking off and who's vm is full! He knows he's on the wrong side of this one!
@SenateDems Please fight for us until the end.
glad you're on the phones. Toomey is unreachable.
doing his job. Awesome senator.
Were you aware @POTUS was removing sanctions implemented for interfering in our election? Because he just did.
@RodneyAnon Slight correction: this sanction was put in place in 2015.
No, these are the ones placed in late december 2016 for interfering in our elections.
it's bad either way, but here's my source: https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20170202_33.aspx …
Were they separate or added on. The articles I see are not making a difference between the 2. 12/28 was specific to FSB
And this one is lifting specific FSB sanctions.
well you've got me there. I lack the expertise :)
Trying to verify timestamps & failing wrt when Congress was notified. But lifting FSB sanctions is not good.
@SenToomey we are calling you and Toomey non stop.  And loom out for our mail too.
- can I leave a message for @SenToomey or whoever has the office next to his? #devos
you make PA proud. My daughter wrote a paragraph for her class about meeting you yesterday-  thank you for your leadership
Thank you for speaking up. And also, thank you for not being afraid to answer your constituents!
We Need Property TAX Reform NOW!
good luck with that
