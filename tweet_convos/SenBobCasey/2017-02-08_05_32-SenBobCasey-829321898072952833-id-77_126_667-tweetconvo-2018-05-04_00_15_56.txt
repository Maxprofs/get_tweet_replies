Casey hates American voters that's why he's holding up the will of the people. Vote this anti American out of office
What ? are you serious?  what on earth do you think the Republican Senate did for 8 years?  Trump is ruining America!
how is he ruining America?
Bannon, Immigration, Health care, pipeline, mentally unstable, insulting our allies, shall i continue?
.  Your bigotry and Trumps inability to see or tell the truth is what is wrong.  my sanity is intact.
Thank you Senator! Oppose Sessions!
@Morning_Joe @JoeNBC Sen Casey making move for 2020 run but has done zip in PA except talk. Losing jobs educ sucks too.#swamp
srsly cant express to you how impressed & grateful I am for your support & determination in the past weeks #proudconstituent
Thank you!
Thank you!
All the Dâ€™s should have come to the floor this morning with their mouths taped.
Fight on!
maybe one day the Democratic senators with work with the republicans rather than being obstructionist
I love you!!
@CherokeeNative3 Thank you! We depend on ethical Senators to defend our Constitution.
thank you! Hope your white male privilege keeps you from getting shut down! #LetLizTalk  #resist #gratefulforsenatorswintegrity
obstructionist!
thank you for standing up against #SwampCabinet nominees!
atta boy! Keep up the good work!
u need to go away
you're mistaking your support coming from your small base,2018 will enforce term limits on you,had Obama's coattails in 2012
Read CS King's letter about sessions. And get your colleagues to do the same.   Force the Senate to censure everyone of you.
thank you sir
thank you.
Please release your constituent contact logs for DeVos and Sessions - pressure your colleagues to do the same.
we know he payed for that seat how else is getting in we are watching 2018 gonna bring change
it's nothing more then a tantrum. You cannot stop confirmation but you have lost my vote next election
Disgusting action by @MitchMcConell and mouthpiece @SteveDaines for shutting down @SenWarren simply quoting Coretta Scott King
I hope you can accomplish this. I'm beginning to lose faith in our system of checks and balances.
your voting record is all over the map. Seems like the Dems worked with him and are now mad because he went with Trump. Sad.
read the letter
#readtheletter #letlizspeak #resist #theresistance
you & I know Sessions is a good nominee for the position, sad day for America to oppose just to oppose. This PA voter watching
Thank you, Senator Casey!  At least one of my PA senators is doing the right thing! @SenToomey
don't let them silence you!  You are our voice! #letlizspeak
why?  Who would you pick?
@SenToomey should learn a few things from you
read the letter. #LetLizTalk
Thank you for trying so hard.  I feel defeated and I don't know how you all have the energy to keep fighting the fight.  Thanks
read the letter #LetLizTalk
DeVos was terrible but Sessions as AG would be a Tragedy...
Holder was tradgedy
thank you!
thank you Senator
rather than work against republicans, try to work together. Radical new concept.
Happy to have you as my Senator today!
Thank you.  We The People.  Rarely found.
you make a fool of yourself by exposing what little power you have. Why not try to focus on what will gain your party power?
Thank you! BTW, is @SenToomey there? We, his constituents can't seem to locate him.
thank you Senator.  A true leader.
Thank You SenCasey #BetrayedByGOP #LetLizSpeak #StopSessions #StopTheTrumpRegime We Stand With Liz and Bob
Rock on, Senator!  We appreciate you standing up for American values!  #standindivisible
every one of you should read Coretta's letter.
all that racist evidence from the eighties was retracted as being false witness. You guys are pathetic.
thank you for standing up for decency.
thank you sir
VERY Proud of You today on "Quoting Coretta Day!"  
Please announce this new important day of defiance!
Meanwhile @SenBobCasey..
Careful they don't silence you for speaking out against a fellow senator, too. But good for you for speaking out!
@SenToomey  @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Fight Fiercely Senator, the AG should represent ALL Americans and Jeff Sessions will not do that
thank you.  Sessions is a racist and should never be AG.
" true courage consists in doing what is right despite the jeers and sneers of our companion" Casey you should try to unite us
Stop obstructing and get to work on ISSUES.  Wasting time trying to stop a nominee that is going to get in anyway.
Thank you for all your hard work & resistance, .@SenBobCasey. (Someday you'll be able to sleep again.) Vote "NO" on Jeff Sessions!
if this was Star Wars your efforts would be awesome. Get back to work.
Thank you for everything you are doing!
thank you Senator! I'm on my way to DC right now to advocate against Pruitt's confirmation.  Thank you so much !
Keep up the good work.
.@SenBobCasey when do you sleep? Keep it up.
You'd oppose god if @potus picked him for his cabinet. Ur fighting president as hes trying to do good but did nothing on Obama
We are SO SO SO lucky to have you.
do the thing, Bob
Thank you, Senator. Knowing that you're there for us means more than you know. Especially today. #NoSessions
thank you
nope
there you go trying to speak for everyone else.
It is you sir speaking for everyone else. I affirm now that  @SenBobCasey speaks for me & my PA family.
Thank you!!!!
