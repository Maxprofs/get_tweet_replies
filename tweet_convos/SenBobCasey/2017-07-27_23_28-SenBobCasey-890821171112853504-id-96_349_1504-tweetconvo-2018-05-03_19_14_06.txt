Thank you to all and to you Senator Casey for protecting your fellow Pennsylvanians
Good job guys, now on to IMPEACHMENT!!

7 YEARS, You ALL have had 7 YEARS to create & execute a PLAN to REPEAL THIS MONSTROSITY!
And when it implodes, will you be blaming them while you are taking the blame you so richly deserve? Nope...it will be trump.
these 2 ladies have quickly become Heroes of the resistance! TY both 4 ur service and wisdom!
Don't forget senator John McCain....
yeah who could foget that songbird
I lost mine because of obamacare.. never hear about that huh ?

And thank you @SenBobCasey for your consistent votes as well
The ACA is doomed to fail and yet you celebrate - You like your Dr, you can keep it.  You like your plan, you can keep it, you save $2,500..
So who will offer insurance to residents of PA since large insurers are bailing out in 2018?
Thank you from PA-11! My continued support.
Healthcare is imploding & you Democrats laughing. Insurers are running out of states premiums are astronomical. Do your job
You should. They led the way. #GirlPower
ACA insurance is expensive for people who become disabled & lose their jobs.cobra is too costly and so is ACA marketplace.
REPEAL THE 17th AMENDMENT! PA should recall Casey!
Thank YOU, @SenBobCasey!  Every vote counted.  Pennsylvanians couldn't be prouder!  Keep up the great work!
Please don't let them get away with this:
When do you plan to protect patents rights? Force judiciary to enforce constitution.
Thanks all of you for voting NO
Thank you Bob Casey for voting NO 
THANK YOU!
Thank you from your PA constituent. Give credit where credit is due.
Oh give me a break. What you want is one payer system. Socialized medicine! We all know it.
Thank you for standing up for what is best for all American's.  Maybe now healthcare can come together in a bipartisan way
And thank YOU for standing tall throughout. Proud that you represent my family.
And sadly, most of America has no idea ... .
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you all.
Thank you, @SenBobCasey, for your unflinching loyalty to the healthcare needs of your constituents.
,so now senators when will you craft a bill that fixes ACA?
Senators should be mandated to get insurance through exchanges too:
As swamp celebrates condemning Americans to heath care collapse, priority for @realDonaldTrump should be killing Congress' Obamacare waiver
And thank you Bob Casey and @SenateDems for never letting up!
thank u Senator. I am PA Proud of your work on behalf of its citizens. History will remember.
Thank you for voting in the best interests of all Americans!
Thank you, Senators.
@mcbyrne @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski I commend Murkowski, Collins AND @SenMcCain
Yes, thank you Senators!
Thank you from PA, I was able to go to sleep happy last night.
Ok 'bob' My premiums have gone up over 200% since o/care. Your goal is govt medicine.  Tell the truth liar!  #CharlieGard
In American heroes week the Dems and 3 gop senators should be remembered. 
American zeroes week is 49 gop sens. @Vp pence & @realDonaldTrump
Amen &Thank you for speaking for us as Pennsylvanians ! Now let's fix it &show naysayers how to do this.Communication is key in everything
Thanks for standing strong for America and PA. You are the only senator in PA @SenToomey voted against us every time and we will remember!
Thanks for your support, senator!
Congress should publicly condemn the threats hurled by Scaramucci to the senator & state of Alaska! It's criminal & violation of democracy!
These two GOP women show what courage really looks like.  They've been attacked for their gender, pressured, yet still held strong. 
Thank you @SenBobCasey for being a strong voice for folks w/ disabilities. And your deft parsing of the bills helped us dig into the fight.
As a Pennsylvanian, I thank you, too, @SenBobCasey #ProtectOurCare

And thank you too. You worked tirelessly for the healthcare of your PA constituents.
We also....??? come on Senator.  Get it right. Why is this hard for you?

The people won't forget. Most of us didn't want this bill to pass. We want all of you to fix the ACA and expand Medicaid and stop opt outs.
Yes Thank You Brave Women ....!!!All over America..
Yeah, govt programs. Run by incompetents
Okay, ACA continues. Congratulations Senator. I am unhappy though. Things will continue to get worse for those in exchanges.
Thank you!
Raise a glass! Well done and Thank you
Yes we do
@DebraHange1 Fist Bump!!!
Don't you mean Skelator?
oh, well I'm sure they appreciate your "also" mention. U senator, but who were the real heroes
Your father would be so disappointed in you. We will not reelect you because you and your liberal cronies are destroying America
I already thanked them. Thank you!
And thank you, too @SenBobCasey
Please add @SenJohnMcCain!
Thank you to all!
Thank you for standing up for the democratic process and not playing to party lines. You women will go down in history as heroines.
They were with us the entire time
Thank you!
Is there anything you can do to stop Trump's plan of let the aca implode & force the people to accept whatever replacement he comes up with?
True patriots. Not easy being a female in this Republican Party. Stood up to the bullies.
Thank YOU Senator Casey who has been touting the ACA from beginning! Thank you all the Senate Dems for sticking together!
Yes, thank you! They have been steadfast in their work protecting us all.
Thank God.
Thank you to them.
