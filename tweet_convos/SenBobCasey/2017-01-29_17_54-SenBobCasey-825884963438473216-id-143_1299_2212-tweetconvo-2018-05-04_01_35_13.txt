Thank you, Senator Casey!
@bannerite @POTUS while you are there, you can convince the higher ups to return this unfit man to his golden potty?  Thanks!
that's great. What are you going to do about Bannon. His elevation to NCS skipped proper channels
you're making this PA resident proud. Don't stop fighting. Fingers crossed impeachment isn't too far away.
Thank you. Now, pls get the other @SenateDems 2fight for justice too. No kowtowing to #NaziTrump He's an unhinged madman
Thank you! I'm proud of you!
I'll be there in spirit, thank you for sticking up for what's right, (proud PA constituent here!)

Hey senator, extreme vetting protects ALL Americans including Muslims!  @SenBobCasey @POTUS
@dem_happy Thank you for actually representing the people! We want #MuslimBan revoked, Bannon ousted, trump IMPEACHED!
Casey in case you missed it Trump won your state and carried Scranton do your job your constituents want.
Doesn't a ban based on religion violate the Constitution?  What about separation of church and state?
He plans to propose SCOTUS today in light of these recent developments! You need to be aware this pick has been PAID OFF
should call for @POTUS resignation and removal of all cabinet members #draintheswamp for real.
not going to happen
Will join in spirit @SenBobCasey #solidarity  @POTUS #conflictsofinterest of countries not listed #Unconstitutional #NoBanNoWall

Thank you for speaking out against @POTUS Executive Order against Muslims. #NoBanNoWall #TheyCameForMe

Senator with all do respect #impeach this lunatic and his henchmen or we wont have a country within 3 months #wearetheresistance #StopBannon
@chrysta10 @POTUS @SenDonnelly
GET BANNON OUT
also to demand a new election-there's a writ in the Docket right now but to rescend the order comes first!
Wish I could!
Sena Casey, your protest more honored if you would open all your doors and invite the street refugees in to keep warm.
@Loca2733Mc @POTUS ask him to resign
Senator-wonderful, but i urge you to shutdown the senate until this bannis lifted
Today @GovInslee called DJT an enemy of the state. Will you be so forceful? So courageous? #AmericaNeedsU
thank you Senator Casey!
#Impeach #StopPresidentBannon #
I hope @SenToomey is joining you.
I Will!
That's the way Democrats should respond! Thank you, Sen. Casey!
People including myself are pretty infuriated about this, and Bannon! Please do Something!
You call yourself an American? You're a mathematician.....a real divider!
keep up the good work! PA appreciates you!
@SocialPowerOne1 @POTUS please call for his resignation.
Start his impeachment! You have the country behind you. Live up to your promise to protect us from domestic enemies.
do all you can to block him from filling the seat that should have gone to Garland
thank you Sen. Casey. PA is with you!
Stay aware. Stay informed. Follow @ACLU.
@Earnest_One @POTUS  Better idea: How about rescinding the entire Trump administration...?  
#ImpeachTrump
...Bob casey...you are a sorry POS  anti American
DT is not going to listen, WH website on govt. doesn't have Judiciary listed.
@SenateDems have to withdraw unanimous consent, no compromise!
and please save education by voting no to Betsy devos
Meh. SCOTUS no longer Exists Per Official WH Site @whitehouse.gov @SenBobCasey @bulldoghill SO what were you saying?
@Honey17011 @POTUS then introduce a Bill to have Trump receive a full battery of psych tests. He is insane
Stand Strong  #NoBanNoWall
Coming down from Philly for a meeting at @HRSAgov - will def come to this event when I get to D.C. #resist #nobannowall
wish I could be there!
why weren't you upset when Obama did this when Clinton did this and Carter also
wrong.Obama didn't do the same thing. Trump is detaining people with green cards. LEGAL immigrants.
once they are securely cleared they will be allowed in.
thanks to a federal judge. Not trump.
Now recant false tweet about Obama.
THANK YOU AGAIN
senator thanks for your work to save democracy!
Thank you for really representing me, unlike absentee @SenToomey. #NoBanNoWall
thank you for representing Pennsylvanians on this! Shame on @PatToomey for his silence!
America (and PA specifically) elected President Trump to do just this. Do YOUR job and support your constituents! Protect USA!
way 2 go Senator Casey! You are making us all proud 2 be from PA
I WISH I COULD BE THERE!!!! BOB CASEY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes, unite to support the American people!
Please do all that you can to stop POTUS from his tyranny on what should be inalienable rights for immigrants.  Thank you.
While you're at it, stop all Senate business entirely and get your house colleagues working to impeach. PA resident.
making PA so proud. Thank you for your leadership
Thank you, Senator Casey, for doing the right thing.
Thank you for your efforts the past 24 hours. I'm glad to have you representing PA. Where is @SenToomey? No show #complicit
you're on the wrong side reading public opinion wrong again from MSM,you're out in 2018,super majority for GOP coming
Please support Sen Feinstein's bill to rescind the Executive Order on immigration.
can't be there bc of financial constraints,there in spirit! Praying for Congress to take charge and rein him in.#resist
@WholePlateWay @POTUS thank you Senator Casey for holding @realDonaldTrump accountable
Your actions give me hope!  Thank you!  Keep fighting! #resist
Thank you for standing strong; checks and balances from Congress & Judicial branches are critical in this era.
Strongly suggest some bearing signs reiterating he lost pop vote by 4M, and only 250k attended his little ceremony. NOT KIDDING
Keep dream. Not going to happen. #LoveMyPresident @realDonaldTrump
thank u senator
Way to go, senator! I'm proud to have you represent PA!
PA Proud!
@OccupyDemocrat1 @POTUS How about filing impeachment papers while you're at it?
Thank you for all you are doing for us!
Thank you
i would love to go! But i have work tomorrow and have to get up early!
he is fulfilling his campaign promise. Remember the people vote
Thank you Senator Casey #NoBanNoWall
thank you for doing the right thing
How much did it cost George for your soul?
.@SenBobCasey @mharvey816 @POTUS Good start, but can you also commit to slowing all Senate business until this policy ends?
@ann_leckie @POTUS how about to get starting some legislation to stop it?
wow that was typing failure. Basically, we need real action
Go do your friggin job first liberal. Like Confirming the cabinet
#SayNo2Mnuchin  Please say No to Steve Mnuchin 4 Treasury Secretary!  He is not good for any of us! Rep/Dem/Ind Thank You
how about getting to work and get the President's cabinet confirmed instead of wasting taxpayer time and money?
thank you Senator!
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ONE PERSON IN SUCH A BIG COUNTRY ..MILLIONS OF PEOPLE..ONE MAN..CAN DO THAT..
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
What time??? Thank you!
Just saw it in the link. Anxious fingers working too quickly! See you there at 6PM!
Will you ask for Obama Executive Orders to be rescinded too? Cannot just go after opposing parties @delcotimes @PhillyInquirer
Dale has a point. It's in fashion to bash @POTUS
Bob Casey, you're a true patriot and American hero!
ur the best
how about #TaxReturns while you are at it? we need to know if business is also motivating this.
Shouldn't you be more worried about Homeless American Citizens and our Homeless Vets Sen. Casey?
Its not like he only can worry about one thing at a time.  #sad
But what is he concentrating his attention on? Brining in MORE people! #helpthehomeless
No.... hes focusing on religious persecution we do not target people due to their faith. Saudi Arabia left off the list,not about safety..
Have you ever been Homeless?  I have!  Forget who was/was not included. Fix America first!
Fix america by ignoring our values, sounds like a winner of a plan.
Fix America by taking care of Americans!
thank you!!
Thank you, Senator Casey, sincerely!
wish I could but contrary to popular right right-wing propaganda I have to work. Thank you ,be there in spirit
Thank you Senator for showing leadership during this dark time. Stand tall; we support you. #NoBanNoWall #nomuslimban

way to represent PA. Your fellow senator from the state @SenToomey has been absent. Silent and absent.
you go, Senator. The world needs to see that we have good people in government, too. Thank you.
the people in the GDR did this in 1989! Help your people to tear down walls that wasn't even built. This is peaceful revolution
don't forget, vote NO for all the cabinet nominations!
isn't going to happen. We the people approve of this measure. Serve and protect the people of the commonwealth follow your path
We the people?  You quote the language of rebellion to support blind adhearance to power.. #ironic #educateyourself
Fact of the matter is President Trump addressed this prior to running and won!
Respect and except!!!!
Lol.
@realTonaldTrump 
When you do what is right and serve God you do not fear.
One nation under God!
More like selectively serving God.  Cutting and pasting your way through scripture.  #hypocrisy
Ignorance is bliss.
Why you would choose bliss over knowledge and understanding is beyond me
Bob, we need real leaders to step up right now. You are making Scranton proud!
