you are sick.
Aww thanks
@PPact @PPFA @SpeakerRyan PP saved my life! Diagnosed breast cancer! ACA pd for chemo,radiation&surgery
Great to hear! Too bad the right ignores this!
We are #Defunding #PlannedParenthood
thank you, sir. Appreciate you standing up for Americans - so few are doing it now.
We are simply taking the #abortion industry out of #Government's hands. No more $$$$$$
hey Barb, get your facts straight. Fed $$ is not used for abortions. Thx bye
Want abortions? You pay for it then. Tax dollars from people who are against abortion don't want 2 pay
Planned Parenthood is America's largest abortion provider. Did you see the videos of them picking through baby body parts?
Actually, PP is not the largest abortion provider. Privately owned abortion clinics are.
Thank you, Senator Casey!
U r Catholic & support #PP? How can you support such evil? Maybe you should pray about it... there's no excuse for supporting murder!
Thank you, Senator Casey! @PPFA @SpeakerRyan
You cannot call yourself a Catholic. Abortion is murder and that is all there is to it. I will pray for you.
PP provides essential healthcare. It should not even be a debate!
how many little girls never celebrate a birthday due to Planned Parenthood? I stand with vulnerable mothers and children.
You stand with killing children? Your father would be disgusted with you spinelessness. So am I.
PP is one of our impt healthcare providers in SEPA. Thank you for standing w/ #PlannedParenthood @PPFA @SpeakerRyan @PPSPtweets
why don't women go to real doctor's offices that don't kill babies instead? #defundpph
OBGYN's do perform abortions for their pregnant patients in emergency situations.
Thank you for standing with PP!
You're a disgrace to your father's name. @SenBobCasey

Phil, you're right... His father would be disgusted. Standing against children. He's a disgrace... An utter disgrace.
So disappointed. Planned Parenthood destroys lives. Women and babies deserve better.
If you care about low income women, ask Planned Parenthood why their money is going to increase abortions and cut services #StandWithPP 
Destroys lives?? PP has been there to provide me with many gynecological & breast exams, birth control, and treated my ovarian cysts too.
So what exactly is @PPact asking not to defund if they claimed the Gov sends no funds to it ? LIARS.
@realDonaldTrump Funny how the left always claimed GOV #TAX DOLLARS don't fund @PPact are now begging not to #DEFUND
It is not what certain people want, it is what we the people want TRUMP to do. #defundplannedparenthood
46% of women in PA who had an  abortion last year had a previous abortion- 36% more than two.Stop funding!
how many of the petition sigs are from actual real ppl? More #fakenews generated by #Democrats .
I am a poor woman in Pennsylvania that depends on the service's of PP. Fund it.
thank you for standing up for this!  It is appreciated!
Yeah....good luck with that. You give them YOUR money...not mine.

Thank you for your support, Senator!
.@SenBobCasey Thanks for standing up for the millions who will suffer and even die at the hands of @speakerryan's greed. #istandwpp

Senator, didn't you run as being Pro-Life? Why lie & say no other options? #stopkilling #defundPP
