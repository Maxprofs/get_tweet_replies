These are not “paid protesters,” as some like to dismiss, but concerned parents who love their children & worry about their future.
And not only that, we're registered voters!
and 2.9 million voted for Trump and Toomey. Your point? #yestoDeVos
That's less than half of the voters in the state, and not all of them are blinded by partisan politics
apparently blinded only applies to one side. #yestoDeVos
unless you actually have a logical argument for why someone completely unqualified should get the position
unqualified is an opinion. And you know what they say about opinions...
& mostly we're trying (unsuccessfully) to call toomey, since you're presumed to be a "no" vote… imagine how many he's ignoring!
Betsy Devos did was broke the law to commit illegal bribery to pay those corrupt politicans to get her approve lock her up!
thank you for listening to us Pennsylvanians
Tens of thousands! SenToomey PA is watching you.
have you considered because teachers are afraid they will be held accountable and will have show performance to have a job?
you just ignore the majority of us PA residents
School districts don't count they are afraid they may have to actually work for a change and they know they have to learn how
bet most were from teachers.
Didn't Trump win PA?
BOOM 
@burberryant PSERS for Erie, Pa already bankrupt. It will only get worse. Look at what LNCB did
thanks for answering your phone!
VOTE for DeVos!!!!!!
so has @SenToomey but he works for the Republican Party, not his constituents.
please talk w/ fellow senator of PA @SenToomey 2vote #noDevos? I'm Navy Vet, w/2 kids and I'm in school for a teaching degree.
please talk with your colleagues Sen. Toomey.been calling his office but I'm afraid he'll vote yes for Devos.
- Thank you Sen. Casey.  Concerned grandmother of 7. Not a paid protester.  My grandson is special needs, very worried.
Thank you for listening and responding. Our children deserve the best. #DumpDeVos
@LindaCrowNEA just curious Senator. Have any Pennsylvania contacted in support of #DeVosconfirmation?
So do the right thing and vote NO!
bravo for listening! DeVos's record speaks for itself. She isn't experienced & hasn't shown concern about our public schools!
who cares!
YES SIR.  TOOMET DID ALSO I ASSURE YOU
Thank you for listening to us! #holdthefloor
funny your republican counterpart toomey doesn't seem to hear us
but have you spoken to @SenToomey? DeVos  not qualified for a job in a school. How can she be Secretary Education? #StopDeVos
I'm one of those - thank you for standing up
and probably equally as many for her
. @SenBobCasey can you help @sentoomey grow a pair and do what we (his #realpa constituents) are begging for.  Vote NO 2 #devos #toomey
so has @SenToomey. But will he do anything about it, of course not!
tell that to @SenToomey.  He seems to think all this opposition is from out of the state.
Please talk to your fellow PA Senator, Pat Toomey. He has been ignoring our earnest phone calls, emails, even protests. #RealPA
and you have listened,  unlike Toomey
Thank you for opposing @BetsyDeVos. She knows nothing about education and has no qualifications for the post.
well those are the only ones you listen to my voice said to vote Yes
So you put special interest groups before due process rights for college students and good schools for inner-city kids?
.@patriot17761980 @SenBobCasey or he just realized that @BetsyDeVos doesn't know what IDEA is...
Thank you for listening to your constituents.  I wish I could say the same about @SenToomey
Count me in. Thank you for Standing Up!!
@SenToomey 1 More Vote. U could be that Vote. The voice that says, I stand for what's right. Please consider voting #NotoDeVos
Please say no to ALL of the cabinet picks! They are all extremists! Cmon Democrats, have some courage & don't give in!
disband dept.of edu,give savings to states & let local govt handle schools,kids will actually learn more with lower taxes
Cheers Senator Casey for standing up to an inadequate choice from the senate. As an educator & parent, thumbs down  DeVos!
.@SenBobCasey forward the calls to @SenToomey oh wait-his line's mysteriously down.
please do not waste our children's Education and rights. We need education for all. Vote No on Betsy Devos. Clifford 18407
This guy @SenToomey would hear too but he's to Lazy to pick up the phone or answer a tweet. #PAStrong will know the Vote
Please get through to @SenToomey, who seems to be denying that we're calling & writing to him. #noDevos #PHLED #phillyteacher
DeVos will be confirmed tomorrow. Get some real work done dummy
add on one more please
#Betsy DeVos is absolutely WRONG to head the dept. of educ. She's not very bright and could use educating herself. NO NO NO NO!
tell @SenToomey yo have aids answer phone- constituents cannot get thru. We want all T's nominees denied & To keep EPA.
Please tell @SenToomey if you can find him. NO to DeVos.
.@SenBobCasey - and that doesn't even count the people like me who knew you were against her and knew they didn't need to call you!
tens of thousands who oppose an education secretary based on biased rhetoric is not an informed opposition.
Just nail her for the fraud she is. We do not want this controlling the education of our children and grandchildren!
because of the teachers unions.
You mean to say you only listen to people who agrees with you.
I beg you to please stand up for youth in this nation.There quality education ensures our countries  future!
liar I know 100 people that contacted ur office FOR DeVos and u chose not to hear them.. we are new voters in PA.we see u!!!!
and I know more than that who realize she's totally unqualified.
Thank you for voting against Betsy DeVos.
@Roadto18 Please consider not voting for her. I used to live in Bucks County...I was appreciative of the good schools there.
Trying to address the actual problems with the education system would be nice. #EqualityofOpportunity
And @SenToomey - heard from those same Pennsylvanians, when his phone lines were open. #noDevos
Are you hearing voices in you head again? what about the Pennsylvanians who voted for Trump & his policies @POTUS @ChristiChat
The only reason I didn't call was because I think you might be a ray of hope. Now tell me why we can't remove the cap on FICA
these people don't even know what they're opposed to, Sen. Casey. You're gone in two years anyway.
I have called for days and cannot get through.  Count me among those alarmed by DeVos' lack of knowledge, esp IDEA.
Nice that you acknowledge we're Pennsylvanian. Unlike @SenToomey who thinks calls are from out of state. Ummm no.
That's because many parents want to see their children in public education actually get an education.
what the heck is going on with @SenToomey? We've been trying to contact him as well.
Who cares? We are not all Pennsylvanians. The rest of the country likes her. Stop going by your own opinion and do what's best!
Why?  I honestly don't understand the trust in someone who doesn't know what IDEA is.
There are issues & questions of qualifications with Mnuchin, Sessions, Puzdner, DeVos, Price, Pruitt & Perry.
and just imagine all the people who are trying to get through to @SenToomey. We know you're listening, THANK YOU!
tell @SenToomey that! He seems to think we don't care or are all from out of state
@CBS21NEWS...SOROS PULLS YOUR STRINGS PUPPET.. PA IS RED..GET WITH THE ACT..WORTHLESS.. #YOURFATHERROLLINGINHISGRAVE
So has @SenToomey
I can't think of anyone less qualified. Me, maybe. But I send my kids to public school, so maybe not me.
.@SenBobCasey 

Why won't @SenToomey answer his phones or meet with voters? Is he a coward?
convince your GOP colleagues, sir
now you need to talk to your fellow senator @PatToomey
education is so important to build our future and create a trained modern workforce. she has no clue. PLEASE oppose her!
Tell Toomey #VoteNoDevos  Time to find the spine for the good of the kids,
I oppose Ms DeVos. She is unqualified and seeks to undermine the foundations of public ed.
thanks Senator for hearing Pennsylvanians
because she's up for the "shittiest pick" award with Pruitt, Sessions, Mnuchin, and Price. It's a close race.
Stand firm!
If she is voted in, the cornerstone of our democracy that IS public eduction, will crumble.  #DumpDevos
add one more.
I can't think of anyone less qualified ... maybe POTSU, but that's about it.
Who is that? DId Trump pick her? I bet she is a fascist.
