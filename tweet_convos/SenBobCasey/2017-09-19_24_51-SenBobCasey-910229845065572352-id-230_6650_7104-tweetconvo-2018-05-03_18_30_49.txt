NEW: AARP urges senators to oppose new GOP health care bill: http://abcn.ws/2ybLmem  
First they need to grow up ! It's called the Affordable Care Act
You're lying.  Money is moved from Fed to state pockets.  But then lying is what you Dems do, just like DT.
#No #GrahamCassidy
Grandma moving in to share a room with the thirty something "kids." The new nuclear family reunion
Can you convince the other PA senator to vote NO?????
PA voters are stupid for voting that animal into office.
There will never be a healthcare bill that satisfies everyone......just look at obamicare!!!!
Yes it must be stopped. And so must THIS, why did you vote yes do give 700 billion to the #Military
#Senate just voted to give 700 Billion to #Military 89 to 8 in favour
@KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker voted Yea @SenSanders Nay
…
Nursing homes will end up putting patients out on the lawn. This is serious business! What kind of country are they creating? CALL REPS!
The Congress should not have health care if the people don’t have it too.
Did the Politicians just get another Pay Rise?
@LindseyGrahamSC are you serious?  You are going to put elderly people, dementia and Alzheimer's patients out in the streets?  WTF?
yes they are bc they don't care!
Individuals with developmental disabilities living in group homes will be affected in same way. Deplorable treatment of vulnerable citizens
Casey and his NAZI kind don’t care at all.
Just got off the phone with your staff at the Scranton office. They are very well informed and prepared on this issue. Thanks for opposing!
Toomey is undecided. Pls call tell him your stories.
Toomey would step over our dead bodies for a dollar. He's McConnell's little pet project
That dead body will be Caseys when Barletta hands him his ass
Lou Barletta, there's not enough Nazi skinhead votes in all of Pa for him to beat Casey
Good luck w Barlerra. He's the most hated man in Hazleton. His bigotry created near riots filled w hate for Hispanic peeps.
High 5 on that one. People hated Barletta before Toomey stepped in the scene.
Yeah that's why he has been elected 4 times in a Dem region. Casey is a dead man walking. Literally! In case u didn't notice trump won Pa
Where will they go? Will their children (if any) be able or willing to quit their jobs to spoon feed, change diapers around the clock?
Trump and the GOP are just the most evil, mean, and heartless people. My Mother will probably die now.
@MorningEdition- hospit, doc.s, gvnrs, aarp, insurers, most Americans. The angle is why does GOP turn its back on all and refuse CBO?
Thank you, Senator Casey.  This is where it would hurt THEM...Republicans...
Those two shitheads are a real piece of work.
Republicans.....the stuff of nightmares
Just where do they think these seniors are going to go? Into the street to die? Would that make @GOP and @realDonaldTrump happy?
Yes it would. They don't care.
Because AARP can be trusted, made $2B of Obamacare, do t want the well to go dry.
@LindseyGrahamSC Vote YES on HOUSE BILL
#SaveACA #VoteTheGOPOut    The GOP are deplorable!
Are you trying to start a civil war? Get your head out of your ass, clown.
Or clean out that extra bedroom because dad is moving in soon.
And his 24 hr RN to care for him. $$$$
No, you just quit your job, move in with Dad to keep him from having to pay $5k a month for memory care.
OK if you can afford 2 quit your job. Most can't. This is nothing more than Government murdering&robbing people. Our family has been thru it
I sure as hell can't afford it. Had to do it to take care of parents. Both needed 24/7. Can't afford nursing home and prefer Dad to stay out
Well, bless you. It's sad we are not like other nations with Healthcare. Life is hard enough.
Hope these Trump voters are ready for their parents to come out of the nursing home to live with them when their Medicare gets cut!
Medicare does not pay for nursing home care.  Private insurance or Medicaid.
Just typed the wrong word. But what difference does it make if Medicaid cut seniors out of nursing home. Part of GOP death panel to save $$
Understand. Some ppl don't understand the difference.
Yes some people think Medicare not government run healthcare
Senators Graham and Cassidy are murderers.
Nahhh Stop the scare tactics. Provide a solution!! States will be given subsidies.
I agree with you!  People in nursing homes need the care. They can’t go home.
Thank you for giving accurate info! Vote NO #GrahamCassidy
This better not happen. My dad was in NH with Alzheimer's-no way we could pay if not for Medicaid. Only the rich can pay for 24 hr care.
Thanks for opposing. I've been working hard on @SenToomey. Hope never dies he will vote for his constituents interests, not the Kochs.
For my father in Pennsylvania. A teacher all his life. A year in a nursing home for Parkinson's decimated his savings. Medicaid a lifeline
There are also over 1 million veterans that depend on Medicaid.  I guess the republicans don't care about military after the come home.
#ImpeachTrump
Lyndsey Graham just wants to pass anything to avoid single payer while pretending to b a sensible Republican-u can't trust any Republicsns!!
What can we do?
@lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenatorCollins Listen you your colleague.  Are you cold enough to hurt vulnerable seniors? #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Whocares?? Just bring on those cabinet billionaires charter planes
Thank you for your support! @LindseyGrahamSC this bill is a travesty. You are HARMING all of us with this bill! Shameful, hateful.
GOP=WE. DON'T. GIVE. A. SHIT. PARTY....
My mom with ALS won't survive without Medicaid. She's just supposed to die sooner so the rich can live happily?
@realDonaldTrump you called the last bills mean this is worse. Nothing you promised. Read the bill! This is presidential suicide
Basically a hate Bill.
The bill does provide for funding of high quality wooden rafts as an alternative.  You place your elderly on a raft and set them adrift.
Many forget that Medicaid recipients often are the elderly who can no longer stay in their own homes. How about some compassion?!
With #GrahamCasiddy, and #RussiaGate, Republicans have redefined the term #UnAmericanActivities.
Americans get to have their parents move in with them . Most are trump and GOP VOTERS.  Enjoy idiots.
This will hurt veterans and people with disabilities too!  So dangerous for the citizens of our country!
Thank you for speaking out against this travesty in the making.
My aunt in Houston just entered a nursing home after years of shuttling btw kids. S&L crash took her home. SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.
Thanks for opposing the latest GOP HC bill. When it comes time to vote on this disaster could you lock @SenToomey in a closet for abt 30min?
Thank you Sen Casey for your continued fight for your constituents. Please talk some  sense into @PatToomey


It's starting to appear to be a genocide bill sponsored by large corporate interests. When will you guys start working for the people?
My father depended on Medicaid in his last years in a nursing home . He was a WWII vet. This would deny care to our elderly. #SavrACA
@staggs8309 @ABCPolitics But @LindseyGrahamSC & @BillCassidy will get their Koch bucks. That's all that matters to them.
Might as well come over and shoot the elderly. It would be more humane.
@SenToomey do you stand with Casey in opposing this uncaring bill? Or will we see you fall in line with GOP and hurt pa families in need
@realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenateGOP this is what you stand for? Good to know the truth about the GOP
Thank you for fighting for what's right
Americans have no one to blame but themselves.This is the definition of American exceptionalism.Lack of healthcare.
Those parents grandparents any family in nursing homes bring relatives home to care for yourself Better learn iv bed pans daily baths meals

and how exactly can an 80 yr old w/dementia care for themselves, are they to be left on the street many hv not a single relative alive
According to #GOP the wealthy in this country are more important than its elderly.   @SethAbramson   @funder
Cutting nursing home care in an area already hurting and struggling?! Is this how we treat our seniors?! Pathetic. Makes me sick.
SAD to think that Republicans will vote for this.
So your going with throw grandma off the cliff http://again.you  liberals are so pathetic
Pray that Republicans recognize and change their cruelty/Universal health care coverage (including pharma/dental/ home) 4 all is the answer.

Glad to see him rip Cassidy -> Jimmy Kimmel: 'Bill Cassidy Lied To My Face' http://crooksandliars.com/2017/09/jimmy-kimmel-bill-cassidy-lied-my-face … via @crooksandliars
My Mother had to use Medicaid to be in a Nursing home. What would she have done without it?  Be Homeless?
Retweet please
Please call Sen.Collins, Sen. Murkowski and Sen.McCann and Sen.Paul concentrate on these 4 make sure they vote "No" to TrumpCare
LITERALLY NOBODY OUTSIDE THE DOME BUILDING WANTS THIS-NOBODY! 

The GOP ran on a false narative now trying to save face vs doing right thing
YES, I AGREE!!! THIS IS NOT A HC BILL FOR US!!! IT IS A KILLER BILL FOR US ALL! PRAYERS THAT IT WILL NOT PASS!!!
This terrible bill is also opposed by AMA, Am. Cancer Society, Am Heart Assoc., March of Dimes and many more. http://www.nationalmssociety.org/About-the-Society/News/Patient-and-Provider-Organizations-Oppose-Graham-C …
@StephMillerShow @szwest1 @frangeladuo GOP healthcare plan?
I think those, who voted for Trump, are going to be very sorry & very angry if this HealthCare bill passes. They just don't know it, yet! 
Does @GOP have ill children, infirmed parents, or pre existing cond'ns?
REPEAL LIFETIME HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO SENATORS & ELECTED OFFICIALS.
IT MUST BE STOPPED THANK YOU JIMMY KIMMEL
Thank you Senator. My continued support & vote! PA-11

G-C bill is insane.  Can the Ladies from AK & ME along with the hero from AZ save us again?  Keep fighting Bobby Casey. Scranton's best
@GOP doesn't care about seniors, @LindseyGrahamSC isn't even one yet. How will bill effect rich white guys from South Carolina?
Why would the Senate do this knowing full well it is NOT what people want?  They can never again say they speak for Americans.  It's a lie.
They just want 2 be in the news,
@SenJohnHoeven - Care to refute this?  Asking for ND seniors (I am one).  If you can't refute, you must vote no.
America, don't fall for this smoke and mirrors on health care repeal. They are not planning to show the real human cost.
So , I guess Cassidy and Graham are starting nonprofit chain of nursing homes for all these folks who must leave
their current ones.
No, just getting more money for millionaire tax cuts by making life a lot harder for seniors and their families. That's what GOP does!
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski    Cmon senators.  You can do better
So frustrating! We all have a mom or dad in a nursing home! The family values party are anything but
Our beloved #WestVirginia has a large population of the elderly poor. WVians, let @SenCapito know where you stand on Graham-Cassidy.
Here's some more info...
Just wait.  Logic behind Graham-Cassidy can be applied to MEDICARE.  Speaker Ryan likely is already salivating.
@StrHon2016 @ABCPolitics True.  The Bill sucks.
@marcorubio ur voting to cut nursing home care.what a nice guy! Tell your mom

.@RosLehtinen  @SenatorCollins  @robportman  @SenJoniErnst  @SenCapito  @senMikeLee Why is this ok? #ProtectOurCare
Death squad for grandma. GOP is literally heartless
Yes. Why does this keep happening sir? It's a horrible nightmare.
I hope that one of them has room for my dad if gets kicked out of his nursing home. do you @LindseyGrahamSC ? @SenBobCasey ?
Sick! They will let people die for greed!
Thank you Senator Casey, knew I didn't have to call you because you will do everything you can to protect ACA. @SenToomey please protect us
Thank you @AARPCA
The same AARP that funded Dems last election? A little late for u to show signs of life. Barletta a comin, Bobby! Be afraid! Be very afraid!
Get your extra room ready or move to a larger house if you need to Mom or Dad is moving home, oh and quit your job so you can care for them.
The "children" of those patients may be in their 70's themselves.
No, just 50's. Been doing it for 3 yrs now. Prisoner b/c I can't leave him alone. Dementia is not a death sentence, no medicare billing.
pitchfork time...
Clean up the Medicaid/Medicare Fraud before popping off.
Bye Bye Obamacare as we know it.. No more illegal mandates, subsidies.. we've HAD IT.. no ones going to cut Vets or the elderly off Medicaid
@Senate @Congess @SenGraham @SenCassidy You Are: Heartless, Inhumane, Un-American! USA CITIZEN'S! OUR HEALTH, OUR LIVES, OUR BANKRUPTCY'S!
@gop @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain DON'T YOU DARE!!!
and just where are these citizens going to be cared for- the streets?
Hey @senrobportman grow some balls like your peer here
Unbelievable those sorry ass people that would vote to put this thru. They all need a mental evaluation starting with NumbNuts.
Death panel!
But of course! Who can profit here? Follow the money.
Thank you for fighting this ridiculous bill!
Thank you Senator #keepfighting #savetheaca
https://twitter.com/funder/status/910246473849241600 …  .@aarp
Watch this Dad say what every other American is feeling. Stop trying to take our healthcare away & start helping us! 
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan  @gop @SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain   @senorrinhatch DON'T YOU DARE SCREW OVER MILLIONS OF AMERICANS!
Why do Graham-Cassidy hate so many millions of people. What harm have we done to them that we should suffer such cruelty.
They don't like peons (seniors, disabled, Vets) who take $$$ away from THEIR pet projects. So get rid of them! Or have their kids pay elder
what are they doing???? have they all gone mad
ANYONE could end up needing Medicaid.  2 yrs of nursing home care wiped out my Brig. General Dad life savings.  Mom HAD to get on Medicaid!!
Unreal.
@SenToomey @SenJohnMcCain how about  whatever you pass is the healthcare insurance that all congress and their families are covered under.

We need to call it what it is: #Genocide.  It will kill millions of Americans. Its despicable.
Exactly. Leagalized MURDER.

He'll just lays a false blanket statement because he thinks his supporters wont find the truth.

https://twitter.com/SenBobCasey/status/910229845065572352 …
Would you like to more accurately describe that or just stick with your manipulated interpretation of the stats? Truth wins.
And Cassidy is a physician?
But facts and lives don't matter to GOP. They do not even understand basic concept of insurance
The age group that voted for these guys...
If u made sure that only people who paid into the system benefited from Medicare/Medicad wouldn't be a problem but no, u need illegals votes
Do whatever it takes to stop it. Offer amendment and slow down business in the Senate. This cannot pass. Thank you.
@senrobportman must dislike seniors because he supports this atrocity. I wonder if Rob even cares??
Koch network 'piggy banks' closed until Republicans pass health and tax reform.
AARP#THE BIGGEST SUPPORTER OF Obamacare #AARP made $millions on the backs of American seniors
We are behind you and support you!
Thank you for your opposition to this travesty of order, justice, transparency and wisdom.
#FamiliesHurt #SeniorsHurt #veterans #nursinghomes #MedicaidCut #KOCH demands this #GrahamCassidy bill #TaxCutsForWealthy #GOPcorrupt
And THERE'S your death panels. @LindseyGrahamSC does not care about the sick and the elderly. He's out to kill them.
Republican Senators will pay dearly for their sins.
one more time for the cheap seats....TRUMPCARE 3.0....stop giving it an innocuous jingle of a name that hides the horrors.
What are these people thinking? So Repubs don't have elderly parents?
Yes but their elderly parents can afford the finest care. Look at Dick Cheney. How much has his healthcare cost?
Real Comparison w/#ACA: Choice between potpourri v consistency, access v  barrier, affordable v poverty, quality v bureaucracy, living & NOT
AARP proved they are for profits not for the people by promoting Obamacare
So when will you sign on to Bernie's Bill?
Vote no. We don't want this.
I hope you can convince your Republican counterpart @PatToomey of that. I'm so glad we have you so there's some sanity representing PA.
@senorrinhatch & @SenMikeLee will you be voting to strip Utahns of healthcare?  Cross the aisle, put America ahead of partisan politics!
Jerry Moran's office taking calls. #202.224.6521
How do they even have the NERVE to call this bullshit healthcare? Who does it even help?
Thank you Senator Casey for standing up not just for Pennsylvanians, but for all Americans!
Pa will be given money and if you want to keep medicaid and keep pulling down PA, go ahead.
Medicaid shouldn't be your healthcare and keeping thesecold entitlement programs doesnt make sense when you can upgrade the whole system.
where is the "return" for funding seniors? Isn't the the GOP's stance? No return? No funding.  Just like Meals on Wheels
If Senior Groups or some Churches & Groups didn't do volunteer work home bound elderly alone wouldn't eat. MEALS ARE NOT FREE EITHER, they
Thank you for doing all that you can to stop it Senator Casey.
PA budget is a mess as it's bond rating will show. You want to spend federal dollars similarly.Cut something senator.Dollars aren't endless.
This is insane.

@lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenCapito @AARP @SenateGOP 
TrumpCare 3.0 will kill the elderly. Tax break for wealthy, take from poor.Sick
Medicaid, Medicare, it's all the same garbage healthcare, try the Universal style & the universe's greatest people will thank you!
Those selfish, greedy Repub congressmen & their selfish, greedy, self-righteous constituents!
How do we stop it? We don’t have $400 million to offer elected R officials. We call. We plead. It doesn’t seem to help. So frustrated.
Mel Brooks captured this best in History of the World.
@LindseyGrahamSC
Trump using campaign, RNC funds to pay Russia probe legal bills
https://goo.gl/uypNEE 
Trump lawyer: "That's none of your business". #TLBBN
This should be sent to every nursing home in the country. Do they think these people don't have phones?? Their own lives are at stake now!

@chrislhayes @ABCPolitics I thought Medicare covered seniors? Not Medicaid?
Thank You Senator Casey! #SaveACA #SaveOurCare
Call your Senators today, PLEASE! Tell them to fix the ACA not repeal it and replace it with this cruel bill. #SaveOurCare #saveACA
What doesn't the @GOP understand? These proposals are terrible for the American people. All for a "promise"
What do they expect people to do when they wipe out medicaid and make it impossible to get insurance? Do Rs really just want people to die?
From what I've observed of GOP members, yes.
They must have had actual human hearts at some time. What happened?
@LindseyGrahamSC you call you'd working hard? This is a disgrace! You and @SenMajLdr should be ashamed! If you had any shame
