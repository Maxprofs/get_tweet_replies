How much did the corrupt Teacher's Union pay you people to yack about failing public schools
Well we KNOW How Much #Devos PAID @GOP To Gut OUR Public Schools for her Profit~
I'll Pick Teachers
I have a problem with School Grants going to Dem Towns that hoard the money for themselves and not t/kids
Thank you for trying Senator Casey.
please get Bannon as far away from ANY governance position as possible.
thank you for trying, we won't forget
thanks for doing right for the future adults.  You get my republican vote.
I don't know #about holding the floor, but your certainly lying on it kicking and screaming like little babies..
Why do you hate inner city kids?
Thank you!!!!!
thank you for standing up and fighting back!
THANK YOU!!
thank you for fighting for us!
also @SenBennetCO 
thank you!
Casey at the bat, hitting a home run! Thank you, Senator!!
Take the union money and run for reelection
i was watching last night.  I'm a North Scranton boy and I was quite proud of you Mr.  Casey.  Very well done sir.
First Priority is to straighten up the Universities throwing out disruptive Students, Teachers BLM
Common Core is history, Public School Grants will be given to the schools not unions. School choice
R U blocking school choice? DO your kids go to public schools?
What about the people who don't agree with you?  Are you going to give them a voice or turn a deaf ear?  Deaf ear.
Thank you for doing what is right! If only @SenToomey could join you...#holdthefloor Vote NO for DeVos!
thank you!! #holdthefloor
@educatorsresist @SenateDems Keep fighting the good fight. Your action inspires dissent which we really really need. 
Also, do y'all need pizza or anything? I'll call for delivery.
What a useless stunt Sen. Dog Whistle. Why not a march on Washington? Or, at least a pep rally.
remember Senator Casey Pennsylvania turned red this last election. Will be keeping a close eye on you and your vote
Public schools are failing our children. Just look around. School choice is needed! Parents need a voice!
thank you for standing (and staying) up for us
I am proud of everyone who is voting no... Keep up the good work
Are you serious?  She is great, you need to support her
what do you think is so great about her?
She will not bend over for the teacher’s unions which have largely gutted public education
Please due US favor and imigrate to IRAN since you support Immigration so much
thank you.  Unfortunately, where we must provide #NOTONEINCH to these awful nominees.
Feckless cracked up Party.. can't wait until we have a filibuster proof Senate in 2018... Worthless
you are on the right side of this, but don't think we don't remember you voting AGAINST Bernie's Rx amendment.
Thank you, all of you who are #resisting
