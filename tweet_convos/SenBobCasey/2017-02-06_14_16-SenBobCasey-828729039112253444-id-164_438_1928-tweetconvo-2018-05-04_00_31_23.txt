Thank you for caring about the children. You've done everything you could. Job well done. #holdthefloor

@retail_recruit    Call to #ImpeachTrump.  Say no to #DisTrumpia.
thank you! See @SenToomey, they're called constituents, and you have many.
Thank you! Keep in touch with us. Tell us what you need!
We have never needed champions and voices of reason on Cap Hill like we do now. Thank you for being one!
Thank you ... We can't allow this to happen!! #StandUpForPublicSchools #ResistTrump
@ealight461 Thank you for not hiding from your constituency. Our other Senator can expect us to work for his opponent.
, vote no on DeVos! American children deserve better.
Thx @SenBobCasey I wish Sen's @tedcruz & @JohnCornyn cared why we want them to oppose #devos. For the 5million TX kids in public schools!
do we know if @SenToomey  is taking calls too?
I just called.  Got disconnected first called again and left a message.  High call vol
was told by an acquaintance she reached him and he's voting yes
yep, his statement is now posted on his government webpage but I'm not happy.
Thank you for fighting for us.  PA won't forget you.
WE LOVE YOU CASEY!
Hmmmm my call kept getting disconnected and my emails have gone unanswered - Democracy I think not !  Group think !
I think that she is just not qualify she just one more yes person for Trump to take control for all his rich friends
Thank you for standing up for us. Please get Bannon out of NSC also. He does not belong there with his views. Scary!
Thank you for leading the way to a better education for our kids!
Thank you for opposing #DeVos.
Thank you for answering phone calls. #WheresToomey
@SenToomey This is how a real Senator works for his constituents. Waiting to see how you justify taking $$ over the needs of PA
thank you, you took time to actually answer the phone to talk to my wife, a teacher horrified at the prospect of @BetsyDeVos
thank you!!
Thank YOU, Senator!
I wish@SenToomey would take the same approach. However some of us will work just as diligently to get Pat Toomey out of office.
thank you for listening.  Now can we get #senpattoomey to do the same?
thank you. She is even less qualified for public office than the so-called president.
Thank you, Senator Casey for listening to and voting for your PA constituents #noDevos
VOTE for DeVos, Vote for DeVos, VOTE for DeVos.
thank you for supporting PA children!
from PA, live in CA, lifelong #educator - I #OpposeDeVos - I appreciate your effort and hope all realize she's not best 4 kids
Senator Casey I can't thank you enough for working so hard for our children in Pennsylvania. Thank you being our voice 
Could you call over to Pat Toomey's office? They've shut down phones and faxes.
as a PA resident I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Wish @SenToomey would do the same.
Thanks for listening while our junior senator is MIA
easy. She's not qualified for the job.
hopefully, next election you won't have a Senate seat. Dems are ruining this country.
thank you for communicating with PA while @PatToomey hides.
where is @SenToomey?  Is he going to speak with his constituents or keep hiding?
thank you senator Casey!
thank you for opposing #DeVos. We see you & appreciate you!
No actually it's probably George Soros on the other line demanding you organize riots against Trump.Or to secretly poison Trump
thank you for all your hard work on this critical issue!
thank you for listening to your constituents, wish @SenToomey would do the same - our children deserve better than #DeVos
thank you for everything you're doing. I called your reelection campaign HQ today to volunteer just as soon as you need me!
thank you from Pittsburgh, 15212 for listening and responding to constituents by phone, email, and for voicing our concerns
Thank you from Bucks County, PA!
Thank you!
please do the right thing by our children. It's very clear she is grossly unqualified.
I live in Pa and I want #SchoolChoice  for all.
I want her as next head of ed!
DeVos is a slap in the face to those who've attained a measure of expertise in education. Not qualified
I'm your constituent and the lack of education standards are a threat to my ever-relocating Army family. Keep fighting for us.
Thank YOU , Senator Casey. Proud to be in PA represented by you.
oppose trump immigration stance as well
thank you 
thank you for listening to your constituents! My two senators from Georgia are ignoring their constituents.
DeVos is in favor of guns in school. We don't want another Sandyhook. Vote no!
DeVos has absolutely no experience in public education. She is not qualified to govern over public school decisions.
How much more do you need than "she's an idiot with no experience & our children and the future of our country deserve better"?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CARE AND SUPPORT FOR ALL STUDENTS !
thank you for listening and acting on your constituents behalf. #MySenator
thanks Sen Casey! I was shocked to get a person when I called today! You make me proud to be from PA!
can you talk some sense into @SenToomey about DeVos???  He's not listening to his constituents, maybe he will listen to peers?
thanks for responding to ur constituent, wish @SenToomey would listen to us #StopDeVos
I don't need to tell you, it's that other Senator whose phone lines are jammed.
Thank you for your impassioned participation in this fight. We have your back!
thank you for standing up for what really matters....our children's future.
You should teach @SenToomey how to answer the calls to his office.
bears in classrooms, no experience, supports guns in schools, pro charter, conflicts of interest. The list goes on . @toomey
Thank You for listening to all Pennsylvanians (GOP, Dems, et al.)!
thank you senator! Perhaps your colleague can show his constituents the same respect! @SenToomey
Toomey needs to take a page from your book! Thank you Senator Casey!
thank you for listening, sir!
Sen Casey Betsy DeVos not only isnt qualified she is actively against freethinking public education Please vote No
We appreciate you listening to us. Now how about helping us with  @SenToomey ?
sad that Katey McGinty didn't beat Pat Toomey
no on DeVos!
you are amazing. I cam guarantee Toomey is not doing that right now...
I oppose her b/c she lacks experience, does not support public ed, thinks guns should be in schools. Not good for kids!
relay those reasons to @SenToomey since he seems to think we aren't really PA residents... Trying to call. Thanks! #JustVoteNo
Thank you for listening!
thank you Sen Casey
thank you for fighting for our children.
that's odd, I can't get a live person at @SenCoryGardner office to discuss #devos because he says we are fake paid protestors
@SenPatToomey vote no on DeVos.
@SenToomey Vote No on DeVos.
Appreciate you listening! Hey, @SenToomey -- clear out your voicemail and listen to your constituents.
and keep restocking that fax machine!
thank you for listening to your constituents and fir caring about education for all our children.
She's I experienced. Never went to public school. We can't afford charter schools. Zip 17870
thank you for opposing #DeVos and for your filibuster!
Really, what have you done for education in PA? Nothing! Might as well give DeVos a chance. I'm a retired public educator.
thank u for working for our state and America so tirelessly♡
No sir thank you for standing up for us!
Thank you for the strong lead you're taking, Senator! *19027*
kids with special needs deserve public education. IDEA!  Ask the republicans to list her qualifications @nodevos
Thank you,@SenBobCasey!  We need you, too, to reach out to your colleagues and find that one additional "no."
Thank you Senator Casey for responding to your constituents and for caring about our children's future. DeVos is unqualified!
I can't wait to campaign for you in 2018.
I can't believe @SenToomey blamed out-of-staters for his call volume. I tried AGAIN to call him, but STILL no luck. Shameful.
Can you try to persuade Toomey on behalf of PA parents and children? Do you have any dialogue with him?
Thank you for listening @SenBobCasey. Too bad @SenToomey, @SenateMajLdr and rest of @GOP are deaf. Vote NO on @BetsyDeVos!
Thank you for listening to the reasons.
Please let Senators Toomey & Scott know they can have Murkowski integrity despite DeVos campaign $ #StopDevos
Thank you and your staff for actually listening! And for connecting w/ Twitter
No, thank you. We will never forget your effort. This women is not qualified, period. Again, PA Voters will remember @SenToomey
thank you for being such an advocate for our public schools, students and teachers.
thanks for representing the Pennsylvania I know and love
Well said!
Thank you, Senator Casey!
I think the fact that she couldn’t even be bothered to prepare for her “interview” enough to know IDEA speaks for itself
@JJohnson2u I am #TheResistance #VoteNoDeVos
good job for you after 2018 except you'd have to go to India each day to answer the phone,our workers forced to compete,thanks
that's the problem with a lot of politicians, they keep referring to our "Democracy" when we are a "Republic"
please call our other Senator @ PatToomey and tell him to answer the phone. You're doing a great job Senator Casey, thank you!
agreed, I wish I had your poise to communicate such 
I called. Will say it again: No DeVos. Thanks.
Thank you for listening to us, unlike a certain other PA senator.
Did you take any calls from anyone who supported her Or were those calls ignored?
Thank you for looking out for PA taxpayers who are stuck paying for all these special schools. @SenToomey is hiding from us!
thank you Senator Casey you're a fighter!

. It's a shame you can't get your colleague, Sen. Toomey, to get on the phone. Or listen to his constituents at all.
There's only 1 reason to oppose her: We need someone in charge of education who is smarter than a 5th grader.
Thank you Senator Casey! We see you!
thx! Still can't get through to @SenToomey
If only @SenToomey would too . Our kids and their future should matter MORE than big donors and Party politics. #noDevos
totally agree!
thank YOU for taking an active role & caring what we think!
I fear for my children with DeVos in charge! Not qualified.  Keep guns out if schools. Keep public schools
thank you for listening to us! Please teach @SenToomey your wise ways.
Thank you for listening!
I'm republican but you got my vote.
Haha you're Republican just because you've never changed parties lol
Has kindabeen like mob rules hasn't it Senator #yestoDeVos
Thank you for working on our behalf Senator !
thanks for listening to our concerns!
thank you for listening to constituents & standing up for pa's public schools & students
Thank you for caring about your constituency. Wish @SenToomey would do the same instead hiding from us.
some reasons: no experience in early childhood, higher ed, or public schools
who are you really on the phone with Marxist leader across the world maybe Fidel Castro & ilk @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods
Senator I'm a mom of a child with autism. I oppose DeVos.
Used to work with autism in wrap-around. Intervened @ schools. #devosdoesntknow
Thank you! This is how a senator gets the job done.
Fine, I'll say it: FUCK PAT TOOMEY!!!!!
thank you for saying it... the tension is decreasing as I type 
no thank you Senator Casey for all you have done to promote education for PA!
hey @SenToomey, do you see how it's supposed to be done?  Thank you, Senator Casey for listening to us!
Thank YOU for listening to your constituents, unlike @SenToomey
really?
