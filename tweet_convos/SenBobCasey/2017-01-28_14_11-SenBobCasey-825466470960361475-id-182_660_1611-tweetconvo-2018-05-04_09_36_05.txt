somebody has to stop this maniac Trump. He thinks he was elected King. He is alienating us from the rest of the world
Maybe that haven't been vetted. Nice pandering there Senator.
The president and his cabinet weren't vetted
they must be stopped from coming to the USA,it's a fact that the only ones coming in are Isis.
They must refuse to sign anything and contact ACLU
Do the right thing, not just your jobs. Thank you Senator Casey for working on this.
stay out of it. Signed, a voter and American
don't forget the people of this state back Trump not you

@TuesdaysToomey @PHLAirport @DHSgov Senator Casey - we need to see a strong unified Dem front. Tweets aren't doing it.
Stop this BAN.
You might be too late according to news reports.
Thank you
@KayCapasso @PHLAirport @DHSgov thank you Senator. #NoMuslimBan #ThisIsNotWhoWeAre

You will have to do more than just make inquiries, @SenBobCasey. This EO goes against all our values and must be stopped
thank you Senator Casey!
Thank you Senator.  Please make this madness stop! #resist #resistwithpeace
Thank you Senator. Does your fellow Senator from this great state have any comment? @SenToomey
please help those families America should be a safe haven for them.
Thank you! Please fight the refugee ban. Please, please, please. As a Jewish American, I won't stand by as refugees are denied.
Senator I think it would be best if YOU went to the airport.
I would love it if this were not true. Reports are they have already been sent back to Middle East.
@TuesdaysToomey @SenBobCasey @PHLAirport @DHSgov what are the more noble flight and bring them back to the United States
thank you!
thank you for standing up against this profound injustice and showing that a #MuslimBan is #UnAmerican. 
thank you, Senator, for your commitment to the values of America and our constitution #RefugeesWelcomeHere
sorry Bob being detained and vetted properly would could and will save American lives .. #usfirst
Brian that's already being done and you know it
if it was then people wouldn't be detained right now.. So no, not its not
that's a leap in logic
Heard forcibly been placed on return flight.  I'm outraged! DEM LEADERS WHERE IS YOUR VOICE AGAINST TRUMP?
Thank you, Sen Casey, for not only stating a position, but taking action. #WhereisToomey #TuesdayswithToomey #PhillyResistance
