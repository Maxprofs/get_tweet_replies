per CBO: Trump ending subsidies increases premiums 20% by 2018 and 25% by 2020. Deficit goes up $6b by 2018 and $21b by 2020,
This is EXACTLY what Trumpsters elected. Sad, they got screwed, ROYALLY & STILL don't know it! (Or got to "ENJOY it" #HillaryWarnedUs
Screwed? Na we loving this. 
LOL oh really? Let me know when I start enjoying it.
A total out and out lie the issue of subsidies was not constitutional
Bob. If. You had not invented this. Shirt Obama care and just gave money to poor and sick to begin. With. We wouldn't be here.
@damonbethea1 @samstein that is what he is trying to do! Create 2 classes! Wants to be King wake up! He does not care!
That's what the ACA was. Takeing from the middle class to give to the poor. Trying to keep us all down. Wake ip
now troll elsewhere w/ 4 followers
they are out in full force
Bob Casey, just another ordinary everyday lying democrat !
A Democrat talking about deficits what a joke
@damonbethea1 @realDonaldTrump @samstein How many things does DT have to do before politicians & MSM wake up! #Unfit!  @MSNBC
@POTUS throwing 7mil people off insurance by raising premiums is #NOTMakingAmericaGreatAgain. Many of these people are YOUR base.
You realize ACA priced 18 million out of insurance, and we don't qualify for subsidies.
Fake news!
I really just need to know if there is anything I can do about it.
Surprised to see you support Insurance Company Bailouts and Subsidies...ACA is the law of the land and failing.
Obamacare is a quagmire and a mess!!!!!
When does this take affect will we lose our coverage immediately if we can't pay?
Pennsylvania and other state Attorney Generals are suing. Hopefully it never takes effect.
Congress never  passed a bill authorising the money to be spent. If anything the payments themselves are unconstitutional.
so you want them to stop and premiums to skyrocket and become unaffordable to a large amount of people like before the ACA?
It would be much better if Congress passed a bill opening up the federal employee insurance system to everyone.
It'd be better if we had a dual private/public universal healthcare system. hc for all, private ins policies for those who want them.
What? Didn't Don the Con artist just promise everyone "Great Healthcare"? They got what they elected! #ImpeachTrump
@SenBobCasey Unfortunately people will need to feel the pain before they disavow. Sad!!
Anything, anything to be done?  He could have never thought of this on his own.
Keep fighting the mad man, Senator!
Sorry, that was ACA, and on you to fix
And it hurts the poor. Not the middle class. The poor. Millions of poor people will be devastated by this. Many will die.
This hurts middle, like me, too. I buy thru aca & struggle w/the premiums. This will likely price my family out of HC-maybe bankrupt us.
Yes that's another blow to the poor which we know he doesn't care about. 
It time to invoke the 25th Amendment.
GO TRUMP MAKE CONGRESS DO THIER ELECTED JOB
Impeach the SOB already

#ImpeachTrump
no that's what Obama care does senator if you guys didn't pass the garbage bill in the first place this would not be an issue like it is
Right.. people will help struggling kids with grandchildren or aging parents as needed.
Do something besides tweet
Consistent with the GOP effort to kill unions...They want feudalism
Do your homework
So do,something about it
Suddenly .@thedemocrats care about deficits 
the republicans sure as hell don't   #totalhypocrisy
The Problem is not ending subsidies it's states like Oregon telling insurers to jack up rates that hurts.
Trump is terrible, as are his enablers.
This has now become Trump Care @realDonaldTrump  by his continuing actions to destroy ACA.
You really don't give a damn about all the people you hurt. This is all about your ego.
You are failing Bigly as a man& President.
It also means the illegal unconstitutional theft from the taxpayers by the government stops. I'm guessing you support theft?
I already pay $1700 thru aca & i & my son have preexisting conditions. We will be bankrupted & likely lose coverage anyway. A disgrace!
And PS I am the very person the GOP claims to be for-middle class, small biz owners, married w/2 kids & we are getting screwed here.
And yet @RepLouBarletta slouches along, stained by the taint of Trump’s cruelty to @WorkingFamilies.
Since when do you care about the deficit?
Yes! I would wait for a good solution. Literally paying more for so called "win" so tired of this administrations drama
Those subsidies were illegla and unconstitutional. Congress didn't approriate money for those subsidies. Pass a bill if you want them kept.
And you all are going to let him do it.
Sir, are you saying the government should continue the payments the courts said are illegal?
For the first time I'm glad I'm so old i'm on Medicare.  Just please don't toy with that!
GOP&Trump don't care about sick children & people by taking away subsidiesl who are too poor to buy insurance on their own! trump heartless!
SHAME ON TRUMP WHO IS REALLY TRYING TO GET RID OF VERY GOOD PROGRAMS INPLANTED BY OBAMA! ALLFOR SPITE! HURTING PEOPLE!
The ACA was the middle class wrecking ball! Who do think is footing the bill for Obama care? That’s rite the middle class!
This is the problem Congress created by doing Nothing to fix this,the only people who benefit the most are special interests& Insurance Co's
OMG. The sky is falling, the sky is falling.

They don't care who they ruin in their race for wealth and power. We have no president. We have no representation.
That’s what Putin wants.  Is infighting. Then we attack North Korea.  Then Russia intervenes.  While our market is inflated causes crash
#BSBobCasey remind them as well that YOU and your 534 friends don't participate at all in this disaster that you created. #ACAFail
#BSBobCasey remind your devout followers how right was the CBO score on the ACA? Oh thats right 2500 decrease in premiums. #Lies #Fail
Isn't it on face an illegal action?
Affordable Care Act was the middle class wrecking ball
@samstein Says the Left! Also said if u want to keep ur policy, doctor, etc. Coming from Cadillac policy users
What are the #DEMS going to do about it.
They already fucked us with ACA. Trump just forcing them to do something now
Liar Seen Casey
CONGRESS POLITICIANS NEED TO DO THEIR JOB! OBAMA STOLE OUR TAX DOLLARS AND SHIFT COST TO MILLIONS OF WORKING CLASS ! 
Thank you POTUS
You have evidence of an American middle class? Please share.
It's now Trumpcare. Let the chaos begin!
So what is Congress going to do about it? Don't wait until we have no recognizable country!!
Make sure you start calling it Trumpcare!!
Well tax cuts will help those affected, 
I'm so sorry 
@SenSchumer @SenJohnMcCain It’s time for Congress to overturn the EO and pass a law to counter it! While you’re at it, Article 25!!
Much much much higher !
He is a nightmare determined to destroy this country
Exactly as planned by #DotardDonnie & his "values voters". They care nothing for #WeThePeople  Oppressing the middle class is job 1.
They can pay for the increase with their HUGE tax break
Please do what it takes to remove the GRIFTER Administration!
What are you going to do about it?
The wrecking ball was the ACA to begin with. Hopefully Democrats will get off their stump & get to work.
Won't matter bcz he's gonna get us all killed anyway

“Wrecking ball”. 
Save our care! Take immediate action to reinstate the CSR payments at least for the rest of 2017. Work bipartisan 4 healthcare reform!
Your honestly trying to say premiums going up now because of this I mean really senator they have already been going up gimme a break
how much would they go up with the ACA continuing to stay in place?
Doesn't it mean the middle class doesn't pay twice? (Their premium + not optional 20% surcharge?) It's not like you were picking up that 20%
Do your job. Appropriate money for Exec to spend.
Invoke #25thAmendment  the man is demented & clearly unfit for office!
Trump is saving middle-class after you liberal Dems destroyed us,thank God Pa is still a Red State, 2018 soon
And Obama care made my work get rid of there best plan because it was to good.  They would had to pay a huge tax on it.
Looks like you're a big Myle Cyrus fan.
This is great. I was just saying the other day how my insurance premiums are so low I feel like it's stealing /sarcasm
Well...everyone knew running a business was not in his skill set hence the 7 bankruptcies. Unfortunately the Federal Government
and it’s people are not a shell game. This is more than an abdication of his oath of office. He is intentionally harming country.
Time 2 #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow #donthecon @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
STUPIDEST GARBAGE I HEARD! OBAMA HAD NO LEGAL RIGHT TO SUBSIDIZE! OBAMA CRIMINAL
For what's left of the middle class. Economic inequality, stagnant wages, housing costs, medical costs--on our way to 3rd world status.
Then stop it. Do something and stop it.
Only in government would not spending money add to the deficit #amimissingsomething
Where were you for the past five years?  My premiums up 60%...I didn't hear you crying then.  Obamacare is the true scheme
I don't think you understand. This will increase EVERYONE's premiums, not just "OBamacare."
The entire government has been assaulting the middle class for many years. Always wanted rich and poor with nothing in between.
And what exactly did you do for the middle class to fix ACA in that last 8 years--absolutely nothing!  TERM LIMITS!!
I guess. The Senate better stop SCREWING around and get some real healthcare passed. Instead of being obstructionist against Trumps agenda.
Told you there were death panels in Obamacare.
Not only will this affect every single insurer policy including employer paid. But the resulting budget deficit will mean they will come
After medicaid then Medicare and Social security.
Throw grandma off the cliff.  Old ploy.
Bot
Hey Bob, after reading much of this thread I now understand why you Dems insult the intelligence of your base, they’re all masochists.
And it will continue until those we elected, who are supposed to be working for "We the people" do something
Who should die all of us or the corrupt individuals that committed treason
So is this you doing something about it. I don't think so. We need you guys to stop whining  & get to work. Bring us great healthcare.
Must be the #25thAmendment distracting @realDonaldTrump 
You lied to us in 2010 Bobby, do you really think that normal. Americans don’t remember the ‘big fking deal’ your Dems promised?
.@SenToomey Not paying CSR to insurers causes higher deficits from increased costs for tax credits 2 offset premiums
When our legislators make laws only to benefit themselves w no conscience, We the People lose out -  Dems AND R's. #Resist to save ourselves
Fake Fiscal Conservatives like @SenateGOP don't mind deficits @heimudan @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey
DT had said he'd stand up 2 multinationals & bring factories back
He hasn't, he can't, and he won't @alfredanchor @SenateGOP @heimudan @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey
Set-off chain reaction of change 2 next party, until ppl go 2 Sts
nothing worse than diarrhea of the mouth! Look into my Chrystal Ball, I see you have problems getting reelected!
No! Trump reversed corrupt theft of GSEs to fund ObamaCare. We the people voted to end wealth redistribution ObamaCare. Congress FAILED us
He is the law & order POTUS, righting the illegal acts of Obama
The pot
Considering those payments are illegal, be happy Congress isn’t under investigation for dereliction of duty!
WE KNEW THIS, which is why we told u #MedicareForAll was the only way forward. The ACA cannot b saved. Stand up 2 big Insur&big Pharma.
Ha! @davidaneves @SenBobCasey The @GOP will NEVER give @realDonaldTrump Medicare for All. They won't even give him ACA Repeal
The GOP WILL DO ANYTHING if it imperils their seats &this is where grass roots populism comes in. Check the poll #s. If people demand it...

Death by Trump.
Pre existing conditions will return. Employer provided HC rates will also rise.  This is #Trumpcare #GopCare
Do u know what eliminates this BS? #MedicareForAll If u guys don't stand up 2 ur Insur Comp donors, many Dems will still lose their seats.
I'm ONLY voting for progressives.
Makes his EO illegal. Send another piece of shit paper for the lawyers to grapple over. Tax payer waste of funds strikes again!!
Everything he has done and will do is about destroying the middle class and widening equality gap. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Don't you mean income inequality that's what you're talking about the more you work the more you earn that's the way it should work
Semator Casey I look to you for leadership  please keep up the good work. Don't ever cave to the caveman he will get  is on another war
If the GOP backs him on this, they will be committing political suicide. I find it hard to believe that they are that stupid. #25thAmendment
Hope so.....
Congress is the wrecking ball! The unprofessional behavior by petty political stooges sabotaged HC. YOU HAVE HAD YEARS, MONTHS, to fix this!
Once again you stoke people's anxieties and tell us what we already know. GO FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT besides tweeting!!
When is Congress going to actually work together to #GetStuffDone? Do your job. Work together. Legislate instead of polarizing rhetoric.
They are working together...both parties...to screw middle class &enrich the already wealthy. Where have u been? Cooperation isn't the prob
Thank Dems for the ‘Unaffordable’ ACA,but I’m guessing you aren’t bright enough to know that the ACA was never about cost&all about control
No, It means the law is actually being followed, since the money to do this was never authorized. #ruleoflaw
The saving grace in all of this is that he won't be able to avoid blame.
Oh trust me, it’ll still be the Democrats fault. Just watch.
I honestly don't want to watch anymore. Can't stomach what I'm seeing.
