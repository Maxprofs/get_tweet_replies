How does doubling the standard deduction and lowering tax rates increase taxes on middle class? %75 of Americans do not itemize deductions?
Because the also eliminate the individual exemption.
Has anybody looked at the %15 capitol gains tax. REITS, lnvestment Banks and Hedge funds biggest tax loop hole. Negotiate 4 bipartisan fix!
And, how much would it be if the spend and tax Democrats were given their way.
Don't forget removing the CBO requirement.
More spin from the left! Basic math: If you have a fixed percentage for everyone, the more money you make, the more taxes you pay.
Furthermore, loopholes will be closed, & the more you make, the higher the percentage of tax you pay. How is that unfair to the middleclass?
OK, again, my fellow Pennsylvanians...If you have a flat tax, you take proportionally a greater % of income from someone making $20K than from someone making more than $1million.  FLAT TAX IS REGRESSIVE and benefits THE TOP INCOME CLASS.
Correct...he is an asshole that lies everyday
He’s hoping it’ll be a miracle that middle class-poor don’t see the increase...
I already pay too much in taxes.
And "bob"....maybe California and New York should quit taxing the fuck out of their people...just a thought
I thought you were for higher taxes?
The "miracle" is that people believed he would tout tax reform that he keeps saying won't benefit him and his ilk.
The miracle is that anyone believed him on anything. Ever. At all.
Miracle of Fish maybe, miracle for the middle class, not a chance.
