Individuals who are "extremely careless" with classified information should be denied further access to such info. 
@TeaPainUSA @SpeakerRyan yep. Let's see if he tries to weasel out of THIS one. The Russians probably can't believe their luck
Watch the fifth amendment become DT's favorite. He'd better hurry with getting his big new tax breaks into law.
Do your job Bob and make something happen please
What did Hillary do wrong again? Really struggling with the hypocrisy here.
She came from a political family and we're tired of qualified people being in office
Now the fools see what electing a non politician is like. Like hiring a cleaner to operate on your heart.
Sounds like a bad idea. Like hiring a plumber to buy your Electricity 
Some people say they wanted out country run like a business, which one ? CrooksRus Inc?
Do they realize that Trump filed for bankruptcy 4 times though? Not even good business
So impeach trump!!!
Not to worry, Senator. He'll find a way to spin that. He IS a weasel, after all.
I'm all for twitter burns as much as the next guy, but can we actually get the impeachment hearings started or is this all yinz are gonna do
Lovin me some @SenBobCasey this afternoon #ImpeachTrump
Did I hear his voice with Trump's saying "Lock her up" too? Should the pronoun be changed?
Yes. Obama staffers will be charged.
That includes traitor reporters @gregpmiller @evanperez who gave details to the world on @CNN possession of intel = crime #treason
Individuals meaning the Trump administration.
Omg seriously!  How about #HighCrimesandMisdemeanors!  Shouldn't that be a bigger concern?  #ImWithComey #SupportFreePress #TrumpNeedstoGo
Bob Casey, did you have the same outrage when HRC criminally had a server to divert govt emails, lied about Benghazi, sold uranium to USSR?
No because after years of your investigations you proved nothing. In America that means not guilty.
Donald Cushing proves himself to be total dumbass by choice, avoids FACTS staring him in the face. Comey laid out her crimes but did nothing
It only took you one tweet to start name calling and demonstrating your ignorance. Benghazi is history and now you have your Trump rejoice.
Individual who;s demonstrated years fraud &corruptions &law suits!Shouldnt be given pass on Presidency!Hello reality 102!
Why didn't anyone ask him about his remarks?
The people of Wisconsin need to vote out lying Ryan. #TrumpRussia #russiagate #impeachTrumpnow #TrumpLeaks #Trumpeachment
Louder Senator. In unison. Please.
Ryan: crickets
The President has not been careless with National Security. How do you even look yourself in the Mirror knowing Hillary was not charged.
The amount of tax $ that goes to pay to keep our Classified data secure is huge & to have the SoS criminally act & not be charged is wrong
If a president is denied access what good is he? Time to impeach this idiot
That dog is still bitting ryan. good.
You are the best Senator Casey! Love this!
@SpeakerRyan is a self-centered hypocrite!!! ...an unfaithful representative to the country...a slave to his & @SenateMajLdr agenda. Sad!

Now Ryan and others are saying the rules that applied to Hillary don't apply to Trump.By the way, Hillary's few emails are nothing compared
Um not sure if you all know this but the President has the AUTHORITY to declassify and pass any information he deems appropriate #civics101
I'm beyond ready to hear something more substantive than polite throat clearing.

doesnt apply to GOPers
@Rosie #impeach
What else ya got, Bob? How about Articles of Impeachment?
@SpeakerRyan you'll never live this one down..
He needs to go.  Now.
OK Ryan vote to impeach trump.
@SpeakerRyan Really?? Does this mean you're finally thinking more about country than party Ryan?? Amazing! But why don't I trust you../
For thee paul, of shallow memory.
In his defense, a LOT has happened since then #Trumprussia #trumpLies #TrumpTaxes #Kremlinklan in WH
#100DaysofShame are now 120 DaysofShame
So Paul has been a pretty busy guy covering up @realDonaldTrump's incompetence
So does that mean Trump isn't getting briefings anymore?
Hmmm...
Ryan- does that now include the POTUS?
For the first time Ryan you told the truth so what do you plan to do about the POTUS now?
Ahem you wanted Hillary to win even with her bathroom  server
You have to wonder if  they even care how obvious their hypocrisy is? Try to pull your foot out of your mouth long enough to explain please
Not important because R's in hurry to deny 24+M people healthcare. McConnell anxious to move on.
It might be time we learned what facts are, senator!!!!
Hey Bob, time to stop tweeting and actually do something!
GOP wanted so badly 2 create obstruction for 8yrs 2 show Americans they were better at steering the boat, only 2 show they wanted to sink us
Does he still believe and feel the same way today? He is a puppet Shame to see the Congress and the Senate failing to do their job!
Well, erm, said...the rest of the world is watching and waiting....
That should be written on a chalk board & hung around Ryan's neck while we Hillary voters jeer at him. Smug, heartless, ignorant fake he is.
These people in the GOP sounds more stupid every day! The GOP is a TOTAL disgrace!
I know a guy...we shall call him Tonald Drump...who fits that description to a T Mr Ryan
Stand by your words Paul Ryan. What's good for Hillary is good for trump. Or. Is it that only GOP are careless with classified
Yes must look back first just saying
@ar1511c @SpeakerRyan  Are you serious Ryan? If u grab a pussy and brag abt it you will do anything and you support this shit
shame on all of you what are u waiting on?  A tax break I hope you all get voted out ! I will help u go
Im so exhausted and disgusted by the hypocrisy flowing from both parties. Why do we vote for the self-serving liars? When is enuf enuf?
Paul Ryan is a fraud. Dems need to link him and McConnel to everything that's going on. They could stop this.
@SpeakerRyan now can impeachment proceedings begin? Get a backbone & do what's right for the country not your political arty. #impeach45
Open mouth/insert foot
I say "THROW THE BUM (s) OUT !!!
@SpeakerRyan remember this?
You've said so many things that are coming back to bite you now 
#NationalSecurity is at stake - DO SOMETHING!!
so why is trump still getting briefings? he is the enemy of this country. he bows to Russia. I will NOT
Seriously? Pack your crap, next election your gone.
This time it's not an opinion from a life long republican that Trump fired, It's actually true.
Shade.
how quickly they forget....
Your basic Republican hypocrite
Yes keep calling them out! #RESIST!!!
Enough with running your mouth! Kid off your ass, and put something on the floor!
@SpeakerRyan seems like you should probably stop this roller coaster before it goes any further off the rails
but but but.Ryans THIS CLOSE to his dream! Punishing the poor and elderly! Just because we rejected it nationally-doesn't mean he's given up
Ahem what? Don't you get tired of distorting perception for political reasons?
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Another @GOP tweet that has not aged well 
Unless our party is the president. Then all the laws change.
#GlassHouse
Gee, ya think? "Hm, this person's a dolt, so, launch codes? Yeah, good plan." 
HMMMM...? DIDN'T THEY SAY THE SAME ABOUT HILLARY!? CAN WE LOCK HIM UP NOW!? IS THE PRESIDENT A TRADER!? OMGOSH!! THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS!!
Word , P, word
Hahahahaha
@SenBobCasey  Thank you for this timely reminder. You are my Senator
Please, please, work hard to get rid of 45. Aren't any Rs honorable? Don't you have one R colleague who will put country first?
#GOPCoverUp into #TrumpRussiaCorruption they allow treasonous #Trump to continue LIES & puts USA & allies at risk! UNTRUSTWORTHY #Resist
Amy Klobuchar said it all, "This should not have happened."  But like her, you too, let it happen.  You are in a position to do something!
It's obvious this man ruining our country is trying to see what it will take until his is fired.   Start impeachment NOW. Please.  Thank you
ahem indeed
Does this stop trump or just someone running for president
@SpeakerRyan @alfranken @JoyAnnReid @AC360 very interesting
mentally ill and not able to control what slithers from his mouth or spying FOR the russians with purpose and intent
As your constituent I call on you to #ImpeachTrumpPence for the good of our country! @SenToomey
#resignmrspeaker
I guess it's ok to be careless with classified information if you're a republican
What will you do about this???
 
But this doesn't apply to Trump.  Only HRC
Would you consider looking at classified information on your unsecured phone at a dinner in a public location as extremely careless?
This cannot be shared enough. @SpeakerRyan has the power to act. Let's see if he will
But now it's about power consolidation and autocracy so those rules don't apply anymore
And yet, this is the party that always points out how the constitution proscribes the powers of the executive so stringently.
#TrumpIsATraitor  abdominal #GOP are complicit.
Very nice reflection of shade there Sen Casey. please do right for PA.
#RealPA voters 
Angry? Then you must #VoteTODAY! May 16th

Everything about candidates & ballet in non partisan tool
So like...does this apply to orange men in office too? Or just women? Just want to clarify to make sure I'm on the same page...@SpeakerRyan
Removing 45 means we are still stuck with the oblivious GOP. Pence, Ryan and the rest should be part of the impeachment. Kiefer Sutherland?
I know he will NOT apply his prior statement to include his "uncle Buck."
Do something now please @SenBobCasey @SenateDems
If that's not the pot calling the kettle. . . .
And Amen
@SpeakerRyan Hey Ryan. Tell that to the president.
This is beyond the ridiculous.
Paul Ryan has a banana for a backbone
Thank you Sir!  Our Republic is at risk of Falling, Of Failing, Of great threats if we continue to allow this President to continue onward!
@SpeakerRyan so when do you really start worrying about your seat??  Good luck with that your lifeboat is leaving soon. #resistance
Can we just have another fucking election tomorrow and for an actual president please?
This country is rotting from the inside out thanks to the Grand Old Partisans.
I hope the Republicans go extinct like the Whigs.
Do your job @SpeakerRyan #FulfillYourOath
And Paul Ryan's hypocracy is actually the least troubling piece of this. I mean we all know he's a hypocrite but our country is under attack
Remember how during the #Comey hearing #GOP was so adamant about punishing leakers? Lets punish the leaker in chief.
And impeached.
I finally agree with @SpeakerRyan
Ryan/ Is/A/Weasel/Snake/In/The/Grass//P.O.S./TRAITOR/ 
@SpeakerRyan When r u going to speak u spineless weasel? Americans deserve better than @gop incompetence. #WTF is happening to our country?
Valid Source from the IC Community. This is why Paul Ryan is hiding. #Trumprussia
GOP was bought by Russia?  No wonder these people behave weird and always have excuses...
Was the Russian  news photographer  in the room while Trump was spilling code words? #russiagate  #russia
Senator Casey.. Thank you for renewing my faith in Congress! Well said Sir .. Well said. 
@SpeakerRyan well Mr hypocrite! What say ye now? Better step up & put country above party! Or will U just be a coward as always-LOCK HIM UP
Isn't that something!!! But Ryan will forget he said that sir!
So Impeach the bumb
@SpeakerRyan - tell that to the "so-called president"
@SpeakerRyan Haha. It seemed like a safe statement to make at the time.
Sir. Thank u 4 saving OUR America. ( ps. U may want to hurry; the tilt a whirl is out of control at the WH carnival!)
What's the big C mean because after all I am Hillary 
Oh I'm loving this!!?
Thank you Sen. Casey 
Thank you! We need all senators to be part of the Resistance.
you need to push Ryan & the other boobs to do right by thecConatitution & their constituents.
All aboard the @SpeakerRyan bullshit train #hypocrisy #opportunist
Please send to Paul Ryan a million times.
I also like you to look into your corrupt buddy WOLF. What is happening to this extremely high gas tax. THE ROADS IN OUR STATE ARE HORRIBLE
You need replaced CASEY maybe at one time you had clout. No. You have put your party in front of the voters in our state. U R the problem
Will he apply this to Don?

Yes
What was shared? We just have the word of the press to tell us. Why should we believe them?
#Howdoesyourfoottaste
Well said, Senator...Well said.
@SpeakerRyan Do your job! Trump needs to go #Trumprussia #wedeservebetter
Speaker Ryan do not let Trump leave this country as POTUS he will not come back he handed Russia the plans to over throw American
that's so pre-election.
"Ahem" hell. Remind him to his face. And Remind him every day.
@SpeakerRyan remember when you made everyone believe you had a spine? Good times.
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
DO SOMETHING.  WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO IMPEACH A TRAITOR PRESIDENT.
.@SenCoryGardner Trump is endangering all of us. He must go! 80301
Trump is no longer a disaster, he's fu..ing dangerous!!!!

@SpeakerRyan #IMPEACH the #UNQUALIFIEDRUSSIANPUPPET
