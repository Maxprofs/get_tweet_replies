If this is the beginning of an effort to suppress legitimate voters from exercising their rights, I will fight like hell against it. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/824228768227217408 …
Please co-sponsor @RonWyden’s bill to make #votebymail nationwide.
and increase voter fraud! Pffft
Voter fraud is a myth created to ease pain of losing popular vote, don't be a fool
keep telling yourself that and you'll be just fine.
Please tell your doctor you are allergic to facts
please try to keep up, and stop watching CNN
Even DT's lawyers say no voter fraud. Stop being duped:
Russia will be glad to know that.
@blightygamer I had to show my ID at my polling place and was not happy. I'm with you. No restrictions on voting.
yeah, wasn't it terrible they id you to protect your vote.
.0009% voter fraud. Respectfully, it's not a concern and keeps peeps from the polls.
you are citing actual caught cases, here's some light on the subject.
yes that article supports my point. No evidence but author provides a "feeling" that it could.
the article, however, omits any evidence that doesn't support his claim. Such as poll workers.
and election officials. Non partisan. My hope is that you trust these good local people.
if youre concerned that fraud could occur because voter records aren't instantly updated. Volunteer.
-your new hashtag s/b #FightLikeHell. We should all be fighting like hell for our democracy!
Democracy includes secure voting processes to protect the most precious right in the US.
There is no evidence of significant voting fraud. Republicans invented problem to suppress voting.
and by the way, republicans fought for the voting rights in the first place. 0 support from Dems.Moron.
So typical change the subject and resort to name calling. I may be a Republican as far as you know.
A sorry one of you believe wanting secure elections is for "voter suppression". Give me a break.
good points both, if only this had been studied... Oh, wait.

So your afraid the fraud investigation will prevent the illegitimate from voting as they have for years. I would be if I were you!
thank you for seeing what was always there. Thank you for your commitment to fight.
@JoRichardsKent @POTUS sadly your country is perpetuating fascism. @realDonaldTrump may not believe he is one but but he is.
Thank you for your courage Senator.  You are the firewall for the Republic.  We need you!
if the voters are legitimate, what do you have to be scared for?
Do NOT vote for DeVos or Sessions!
Devos will drill some edu into UR KIDS. Sessions will be ROUNDING THEM UP COWBOY. Including HRC,AG YIPPY

You & other congressmen need to do whatever it takes to remove trump/cronies now before U.S, citizens step up & do it by force!
Better start fighting like hell, especially as our state is so gerrymandered to start with.
You will have lots of company...and lots of White House opposition.  Company "trumps" opposition.
.@SenBobCasey Give @POTUS copious amounts of hell! #RESISTANCE
