Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision
Refugee screening is 18-24 months. I'm open to improving it but it needs to comply with this document we have: the Constitution.
In 2015 Congress strengthened visa waiver program. More security can be done legally, exec orders written on the back of a napkin however...
You're getting a ton of anti DeVos constituent calls. @SenToomey must be too. Then why wouldn't he also vote "no" on DeVos?
He's bought off.  Devos donated $60,500 to his campaign
It's clear that this is conflict of interest for @SenToomey. Shouldn't be able to vote if vote has been bought.
yup. But still legal thanks to citizens united & the GOP not passing legislation for campaign finance reform
Ugh. So this falls under Citizens United decision? Awful. Just one of the many reasons to oppose Gorsuch...
Yeah. It's so bad, it's destroying our republic. We're going to need to take drastic measures to fix this.
trump has no idea how the laws work. He is truly clueless and that's dabgerous. Dangerous to our democracy
trump is a terrible decision
@dan_bernstein @potus have someone read you the constitution. Great document. So important. Stop trying to go around it.
If Clifford the Big Red Dog was around 25 feet tall, he would produce an estimated 1,320 pounds of dog poop a day.
trump is one of them...
The so called president is not that smart
thanks for speaking out. Please find @SenToomey and tell him that PA constituents expect the same from him! No DeVos!
@OregonsFan I can't help reading trump the way @Trevornoah does him
#DonaldTrump TheOnlyThingDeplorableInThisCountryISTrumpIgnorance
I stood in line for 5 hrs last time I came into this country. And my mom was vetted for 16 yrs before she came here.
thank you for standing up for what's right
kudos to you for speaking out
He believes his own words about the Muslim Ban he called for. He should withdraw it and see what we do currently.
I have called to vocalize how proud I am for you for represent America and our values for Pa.Thank you and you earned my vote.
Thank You! @realDonaldTrump is used to private jets the rest of us who've traveled know no one strolls in.
@hwaadt so why do you think @realDonaldTrump, who has traveled extensively, not know this Senator?  Dementia or he's a liar?
By my count at least 4 judges have blocked parts of the ban.
@jasonkwatkins   What is Trump's end game with Russia? I hope it's only about money. And how many allies will he give up?
You're using reason against insanity (paranoia?). Good luck with that!
trump is mentally ill and should be monitored very closely.
@marcylauren all I can say  is why do it seem like we being going through  this forever
issue is Putin controls his BFF Trump.
I solemnly swear  to uphold the laws and NEVER say a negative word against Mother Russia.
#TraitorInChief 
your pride and need to be recognized most likely put many Americans in danger. I wish you would have cared about our safety
he recognizes that the CONSTITUTION runs this Country/sorry, NO WHERE in that doc does it say CHRISTIANS ONLY
Senator you should know by now that the truth is of no consequence to Trump.
President Carter & his Iranian ban under (8 USC 1185) June 27 1952 Does #Trump not have a right & duty to protect the nation?
I can't believe you have to explain that to the President of all people
i bet now terrorist all lined up to get in while the band is lifted
@ProvaxShill I am a white English male married to a US born white American.. took me months of thorough scrutiny to get here
@realDonaldTrump Can't wait to watch Senator Casey win the 2020 Presidential election!  Casey and @CoryBooker in 2020!
his vocabulary is so simple so plain. It's as if he obtained his sound bites from  "How to be a dictator for dummies"
Thank you @SenBobCasey for standing against this gross abuse of power & fighting for Muslim brothers and sisters at PHI. I'm a proud PA boy.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Your order was dangerous & unconstitutional. The judiciary did their job unlike you. Get over out SF
Part of problem is most Trump supporters aren't open to traveling outside US.So don't understand process. DJT is fearmongering!
Tell me this senator. How did the people that flew into the twin towers get here?
@ThomasJ17762016 @realDonaldTrump If that's true, how shall we be panic-stricken?
"Pouring in" lol. Even from UK/IE with an ESTA takes forever. Don't find customs stickers all over my stuff traveling elsewhere
I really can't read his tweets. It's like he never learned anything in the language arts
Any country for that matter has similar  laws & regulations
Senator, teach DT something about govt.  A little Civics 101?
Thank you!!
@realDonaldTrump 
That is a lie. Why would u tweet that?
You're missing the point! Why bother discussing improvement when Trump tweets outright propoganda? Hammer the lie. Do your job!
thank God you are sane.  The @GOP can't face reality yet
"pouring" into the country, right. Enough with the alarmist bullshit.
tiny hands you are a bad and dangerous person ...how did you get in here!? #impeachTrump #NotMyPresidentTrump  #resist
@realDonaldTrump trump: the number one source of #fakenews. Does he know nothing of our government?
and he uses fear mongering so expertly. "Pouring in". He has gone unchecked & this will cost us all dearly soon.
U R aware the Constitution only applies to those in the US. Not those that want to come.
checking is questionable, did you ever read the current vetting procedures/ total Joke! We needed a temp. Halt to do better vet
Does he mean "bad & dangerous people like himself & Bannon?
unfortunately I don't think he actually knows that.
@GOP trump should be required to go through airport passport control to see what an ordeal it really is even for US citizens
@realDonaldTrump trump should be required to go through airport passport control to see what an ordeal it really is even for US citizens
@realDonaldTrump keeps lying to the public; inciting hatred and violence #DishonestDonald
I find the "pouring in" speech, min. such, like yelling Fire when there is none. ridiculous and grounds for reproach
Thank you for all that you are doing, Senator Casey!  I know it's demanding but you rise to the occasion...tux and tails!
There are a lot of checkpoints. Plus PHL has a beagle sniffing ur bag.
Sad that we have to state the obvious, no?
exactly, it takes months if not years.
good point and I concur with your statement -
He so desperately needs that fear
This isn't about what happens at airports. It's about the documents the airports have to do the check.
I am taking bets he has NO idea what the current process is.
