Yes, these are war crimes which Obama totally ignored. Never followed through with the Red Line. The BLOOD is on @BarackObama hands.
No douchetard, the Republicans refused to let him do anything. Blood is on their hands.
Obama was Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces he droned whomever he wanted to, he ignored this for years.
No, he tried to do something and Republicans blocked him.
The party of no really screwed the Syrian and American people
And they just keep on going with it.
#RedLine
Sadly, it's true
They send a 38 year old real estate guy with his body guard wearing a sweat suit to Iraq what we expect.
Where were you when BHO discussed crossing the line in the sand?  Crickets...

Senator Caseyvplease N
He can't-Putin has Trump's Rosneft oil check.
Thank you, Senator Casey. I wish you would run for POTUS.
Hahahaha
Careful Senator, attacking Russia could hurt @POTUS's feelings.
thank you again for continuing to speak up,  #BobCaseyforPresident
#ThanksObama #RedLine
Obama requested to Congress to take action against Assad, they refused https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_the_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_the_Government_of_Syria_to_Respond_to_Use_of_Chemical_Weapons …
Who's nagging them on
And Trump administration is in bed with Putin!  No on Gorsuch!!!
@frustatedinid @realDonaldTrump 
They're strategy  is2 make as much money as fast as they can b4 ppl realize what they're doing
2/2 It's a lose-lose situation now. We ignore,we look weak;We go in we'll cause more devastation-either way enemies will say we don't care
This is what we knew all along.Will Judas Trump revise his statement about Syria when he finds out his boy Vlad involved with kids murders?
He said today his opinion of #Assad has changed. There may be some semblance of humanity in him, even if very minute. However, it's wait&see
I know you must love @KamalaHarris - you're no longer the dumbest senator.
yup and bigly huge profits for weapons/arms mfg
Russian jets bombed the hospital where the victims were being treated AFTER the chemical attack!
It's just beyond heartbreaking. 
We wouldn't be so deep in this mess if Obama had done his job instead of making excuses. Be didn't act, but @POTUS Will. Obama weak potus!
WRONG!  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_the_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_the_Government_of_Syria_to_Respond_to_Use_of_Chemical_Weapons …
This @realDonaldTrump  is indebted to @PutinRF_Eng and will not anger Putin. Will do nothing in Syria which is Russian dominated country.
You're the *LAST* person the President will tell about his strategy - what he is going to do about Korea and Assad.
We'd never be in this situation if the previous administration had a set of balls. Our new president will handle this in due time.
and so I guess the same shit didn't happen when Obama was occupying the White House one sided for you Dems
Same old false flag bullshit for seventy years
Except that the war criminals are the Rebels. They started the war. They have used Sarin on their own. Let Russia/Syria end this ugly war!
did you criticize Pres Obama for his complete failure 're Syria and Russia, just to start the list. Tow the Party line as usual
And wait! Let's not let any of these desperate refugees into our country.
Assad did this and the Russians are backing him.  Do you want to start a World War?
DJT pretends to be upset about Syria but blocks the ppl from escape... tell it? He doesn't even know it!!
1/2-To speak w/"moral authority" one must have morals-DT doesn't.RexT said US doesn't care what Assad does-so he did this w/Putin's help
No bootsonbthevground.?trum
Who is providing Assad with chemical and non chemical weapons?
And Trump funds it.
That's my Senator
He can't say bad things about his bestie putin
You tell them
But Putin is such a great leader! He's fantastic! The only one that's better is Donald Trump!
Thanks to Senator Casey for calling it like it is. Putin is behind this slaughter like so many other atrocities.

@AleciaWarrenXO @realDonaldTrump Trump just changed his mind on Assad.  And he hopes his boss (Putin) did too!
@SenBobCasey @SenBob, US said the same about the Gaddafi n Hussein, now Assad,  it's just lies, bc, US wants war n everyone's resources.
He can't say that, since multiple members of his staff were taking money from the Russians, and Roger Stone colluded w/Guccifer2.
POTUS is blatantly flouting the emoluments clause for rubles & you guys are doing nothing! You expect the world to look to us for guidance!
Thank you! Now do something and help these children!
Congress refused to authorize strike on Assad. Tell it like it is.
Casey for President 2020
get on it or under it
He will never admit to Putin's war crimes, murders or spies in his Tower.
@VLVANCE @realDonaldTrump TRUE WORDS WELL SPOKEN!!!?
Mr. Sen. you take the word of Brit terrorist in Syria whose med license UK revoked as excuse for more war crimes?
so tell me what u think we should do...I'm betting u don't have a clue
Scary thought: When will Putin start to orchestrate attacks in the US?
He can't and won't.  It comes with the Gold "Putin Package' he signed up for in 2013 when he had hookers urinate on a mattress in Russiavill
No one knows what 45 will do. His son-in-law and daughter have not told him yet

The empty suit speaks
@military_widows Senator, CNN reported that benefits will run out for this group next year - MoC, pls help @SenToomey @RepRyanCostello
If you  want to look at the worlds Great War Criminals look no further ... they're American using 'spent uranium', starvation, rubbleization
The @POTUS has himself in a complete mess.... Putin has a collar on him!!!
Paula This makes sense. @POTUS on a leash! No wonder he is willing to kiss up to the person at the other end-Putin. (he does Whine a bit)
You can't do anything about Assad or Russia.  But you can Name Americas WAR CRIMINALS ... or is that a example of American Exceptionalism?
The secretary State he don't deserve to be in the Job,He don't have any experience.
Exactly, we cannot allow this wrong headed America first  policy-as we pull back, China ,Russia, Iran step up : Trump had no foreign policy
and Dems let Assad get away with it for years
When you're sleeping w/the enemy, its impossible to condemn their actions. Don't hold your breath, criticism of Putin is not forthcoming.
@Senator the USA can't point fingers while openly starving civilians in Yemen.  How about naming American War Criminals starting with @Bush
This calls for a red line.

Not to mention Obama/Hillary's illegal arming of the Syrian rebels.
Okay.  So...invasion? Sanctions?  Strongly-worded letter like President Obama did?  I don't want to hear talk about this.  DO SOMETHING NOW!
Like it t.i. is
& to Donald Trump who gave a wink and a nod. #Complicit
You always wanted @POTUS44 to say radical islamic terrorism, take just a minute & call out your boy Putin & the Russians #Trumprussia #sad
Don't leave obama bombing hospitals that is a war crime too bob
Will ONE Senator sponsor a bill to do SOMETHING about Assad and Syria.
Gain a pair, would you please!
We need term limits!
So proud to be represented by you.
Same thing going on for years under democrats and obamas watch. Tell it like it is bob!
Did Shumer tell you to say that. Shumers puppet!
GO CASEY!!! MAKE US PROUD.
Please ask where the Sarin came from.
THE RUSSIANS ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED AND I HAVE NO DOUBT PUTIN DID THE GAS TO TEST TRUMP
Putin is definitely testing Nato, EU and US. Has been doing it for some time.
Oh, look!  A democrat suddenly interested in Assad's crimes. And are you suggesting we go to war? Where was your concern 2012-2016?
the concern was there & Obama asked congress for a vote action..GOP refused to vote on it
