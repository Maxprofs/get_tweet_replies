.@SenBobCasey what about Planned Parenthood. @PPact  Will you oppose those cuts as well?
Let's take care of the living instead of telling women what to do with their very own bodies, k?
How about we all try take care of both marginalized groups at once? Intersectionality is important
afraid Mr. Noon does not understand health care at all.
Jodi, being a Canadian, I do understand healthcare. Ours is actually quite awesome.
apologies. Misunderstood your first reply
All good
again, apologies… misunderstanding!
@T_E_D_1949 @nytimes Thank you Senator for your firm opposition.
thank you! @nytimes
@KeepObamacare @nytimes I am 51, disabled. I Would become sicker, cancer survivor, arthritis. Don't let this happen, begging.
Thsnk you sir!
Explain why, please?
Bombard republicans what will happen to them in 2018 they have to remember some republicans are seniors also!
Don't forget, they are rich seniors. This is where the first cuts need to be made. They are traitors.
thank you for working for the people Senator Casey
Thank you for your opposition! PA Kids with disabilities are counting on you!
Thank God there are some glimmers of reason and sensability in those hallowed halls! Bless you!
could a democrat ever tell the truth.
@TinaPirlot @nytimes Is he going to run over homeless people too!? Get him out of the White House
@KeepObamacare @nytimes My stage IV pink sisters are frightened they'll die if #ACA gone. The "Replacement" is cruel. Anguish!
stop the bullshit.  Moving to the states.. guess pa@has some adult deciding to do. Only so much money.
How is it "bullshit"? Did you read the plan that they've outlined?
Block grants put patients at the mercy of politics/State. It's cruel! What if Govs  refuse funds again like in #ACA ??
@AleciaWarrenXO  Sen Casey HOW many of your fellow senators will oppose this bill?HE WILL get away with it he has CONgress side
Thank you! And thank you for opposing the DeVos nomination. Thank you for fighting for the greater good!
How kind A love you to a oppose cutting help for those who aren't on the tax payers teat We deserve what we pay for.
senator with all due respect let's wait and see their bill, you sound like @SenSanders folk of crap
please know how much we appreciate you here in PA! You are a fine man.
TY @SenBobCasey
We need you to go to the mat on this for us. Trump is destroying lives.
reported that you voted against lower drug prices, accepted over $450,000 from big Pharma over the past 5 years - fix that too.
Please consider a NON-govt. solution to all healthcare issues. Healthcare sharing org's, great NON-govt, faith-based solution.
TRUMP admin colludes with McMonster & ButcheRYAN to murder 1000s of AMS with a pen. Not so bloody, but dead is dead.
. Thank you Senator Casey
Thank you.
I will die without it.
Janet! So sorry they are doing this to you! I hope You live! So sad what they do. :'(
Ryan already had that shit ready to roll.
P.RYAN is the worst smug thief, robbing the 99% we the people, to give tax cuts to the 1%! Pure Evil!
@AleciaWarrenXO @nytimes hi trump supporters wake up
Thank you, Senator Casey. It's reassuring to know you are there for the citizens of Pennsylvania and the U.S.
I would hope u would oppose any cuts to seniors how about working on that other guy to see the light @SenToomey
anyone who can take  from the people that are the most vulnerable are evil s.o.b.s .... period
@kilgoret95 @nytimes Thank you, Senator.
Keep fighting for Pennsylvanians. Low income and elderly are not second class citizens! #resist

Dear @UN & @NATO

Liberal America did not abandon you…
THANK YOU! When the ED budget was cut in PA and teachers lost their jobs, we relied on #Medicaid and #CHIP.
@citizengatsby https://twitter.com/dodi70/status/823384789843517441 … PLEASE READ. WE THE PUBLIC NOW KNOW PUTIN PUT HIM IN. HE MUST GO!
Here is how Trump/Putin Stole the Election... https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-mr-putin-lets-play-chess-louise-mensch-trump-russia/ …
Thank you. We support your leadership. No to block grants and high risk pools! @SenToomey  what about you?
so you're finally going to do your job?
Red Tape Govt Adm takes up more of the $$ than goes to the Doctors for Patient Care-Block Grants would work  better
@TranBuhbling @nytimes GOP seems to be doing bidding If donors and not the PPL they were elected to represent!
TRUMP WILL NOT DO THAT
Thank you for all the good work.
Please speak out about this on talk shows. Most people unaware. NO PRIVATIZATION or CUTS to Medicare, Medicaid Soc Sec
GOD. BLESS. YOU. SIR. PA. PROUD. #Indivisible
you can also blow the whistle on illegitimate leadership, securely.
Keep America Truthful. The AP's investigative journalists are standing by for your leaks: https://securedrop.ap.org/  - Let us hear from you. 
way to go Casey... Keep up the good work!
I won't live w/o medicaid. DX is SMAD3 Loeys Dietz Syndrome & a dilated aortic root valve aneurysm. I'll need surgery.
@HouseGOP  Thanks for fighting for the marginalized  - why are the @GOP disenfranchising ? Doesn't sound like it will #MAGA
Thanks for fighting this. No way should this pass! @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand
thank you Senator
How will you deal with the LIES from the current administration? Will you let PA know the truth?
You had a chance to clean up the Medicaid abuse....WHY DIDN'T YOU!!
thank you for your continued fight for us. @SenToomey please oppose this. Our seniors deserve access to affordable healthcare
thank you
Thank you. This is important for many Pennsylvania residents.
@JustSchmeltzer @nytimes The consideration of cutting funds 4 Medicaid, while giving a tax break 4 the 1% is absolutely vile!
@JustSchmeltzer @nytimes I surely hope you will
Thank you!
thank you!
THANK YOU!!!
So much for promises. I may be homeless. #TrumpLies
I'm a senior and you still make a fool of yourself!!!!!
Block grants are often diverted by states, misused, then eventually cut. It's a way to kill Medicaid. Thank u senator
@beatgozon @nytimes
Anyway not so much was solved before 2 years in medicare I could not see a doctor once and 2 month 2 make appointment and $30
Thank you Senator. Don't let this corrupt administration destroy our country. Keep them accountable to the American people.
Thank you for fighting for us.
thanks.  How can we help?
@ElMonte08 @nytimes Thank you! For those of us that have loved ones dependent on Medicaid this is a huge concern.
Thank you ....please fight for us
have ever done a budget Sen Casey? I doubt it since you live off my taxes
Thank you for being the voice of compassion for PA!
where is this pledge?
@ElMonte08 @nytimes 
Democrats giveth
Republicans taketh away.
We all knew that Trump and the GOP had no intention of giving healthcare. If they did they would have done it years ago
Thank you. We need you on our side!
What's the best way for your fellow Pennsylvanians to help in your efforts?
What was your problem with lower drug prices?
Thank you. I hope you will work to convince @SenateDems to stand strong together in opposition & pull some GOP Sens over.
Oppose you must, fight you must, do not give in!
thank you! We stand with you. And we appreciate you standing for us.
Please talk to your friends across the aisle. We are counting on you. #workingpoor
Thank you! Block grants will gut Medicaid.
impeach him and all his threats go away
Thank you. We are counting on you.
So much for making America great again! So much for keeping his promises too. Don the Con gutting America.

Thank you senator.
