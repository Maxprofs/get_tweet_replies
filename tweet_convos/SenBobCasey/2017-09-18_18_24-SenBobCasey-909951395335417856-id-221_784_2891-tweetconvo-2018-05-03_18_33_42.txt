Thank you
Thank God for sense and reason#Senator Pat Toomey#victory for the working families #obamacare is not affordable or free
Love this, but why won't you support the Medicare for All bill?!?
Thank you Sen. Casey. As a 2-time cancer survivor, this "plan" would be devastating for me and my family
Thank you for working hard!!
Senator Casey, the Unaffordable Care Act isn't a plan. My healthcare costs are up 250 % since the ACA passed. What is your "plan" Bobby,!?!?
It's not the affordable care act it's Obama care.
Thanks Bob for being the representative who cares about Pennsylvania!
Sit down and be quiet #obamacare is history #failed Democratic Party plan#keep your doctor hypocrite
Please defend current plan and oppose strongly!!!
We are with you! Thank you for fighting for us!
Keep up the good fight against GOP killing millions of people
Thank you!!!!!
Go get 'em Senator Casey! Thank you!
Thank you @SenBobCasey. It's unfortunate your PA colleague @SenToomey does not share the same humane interests. All repeal acts lack empathy
Thank you. I feel helpless bc Toomey is a lost cause.
Really, how are you plannning to hurt us now? Don't look forwrd to re-election.
Are they just trying to sneak this by us or did they make any good changes? Seems sneaky.

Sorry i missed it. I was watching a Mickey Mouse cartoon. Kind of reminded me of Congress.
So what's your alternative?  The Dems will not lift a finger to FIX ObamaCare, and they know it needs fixing badly.
Thank you!!
Please help save us from this monstrosity.
Invent legislation that does away w/the Obamacare fine.
Thank you!!!!
I did not miss it. I just don't care. Both of your parties are only in on it for what benefits you both...
$80 billion should be for the illegals.  Should last them at least 2 months.
Thank you!!
Vote no. Don't let McConnell bum rush it!

Pennsylvanians thank you, Senator.
Sen Casey..was there a video made....I'd be interested in seeing it?

you & your staff are a credit to PA constituents & to the nation. Thanks Senator!
Watched you speak Senator, hopefully Senate Republicans will examine their consciences and vote against this evil health care legislation.
Thank you Senator!!!!!
You know what it is and can speak to the specifics ??
Push MEDICARE for all. Be PROACTIVE not reactive.
Good Luck Senator.
Gov't needs to get out of the healthcare business. American people can make better choices for themselves! #ABETTERWAY
Healthcare is a human need,a human right. Single payer, universal, equal for all.
Great job Senator supporting a program where the government is in control and the individual does not! https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/us/politics/senate-health-committee-obamacare-bipartisan-fix.html?referer=http://www.google.com/ â€¦
Thank you, thank you, thank you! You're the best

Thank you, Senator. I wish our other senator had even half as much desire to serve the people of PA.
Proud you are our Senator!
Thank you Senator Casey for representing PA. Once again in a awful bill heading to the floor. The weakest of us will suffer.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for fighting for us and our access to affordable, life-sustaining health care!

Thank you and  @RepBrendanBoyle for standing with your constituents. I wish @SenToomey would do the same. 19406
Thank you, Senator Casey.  Here's a task. Convince Pat Toomey not to hurt his constituents just to give trump a win.
Will the Junior Senator from PA be joining you or will he be busy cashing Devos and the Koch brothers checks? @SenToomey
Just continue to oppose everything, and make sure your resume is up to date
If private health care is good for the American citizen, it should also be good for members of Congress. #Trumpcare
Zero credibility after Dems foisted travesty of Obamacare on America with blatant LIES
Thank you!
Good luck  
Go Socialist, go!
Govt run Healthcare for all
Govt run college for all
Govt run childcare for all
Why
Bother 
Working 
We'll all b venezuela
Why oh why is there this endless reprise? Waste of time money and whatever goodwill is around
Please fix the ACA and use this as a bridge to #MedicareForAll. Please cosponsor the bill, for all Americans. We deserve better.
Thank you for doing this! Hateful that the GOP is trying to sneak this awful "health" bill through. WE WILL FIGHT THIS TOGETHER!
#DeathByGOP will be the leading cause of death
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you for sticking up for our healthcare, Sen. Casey!
Destroy this abomination of a bill, Senator
Thank you, sir.
Please tell @SenToomey  bill for veterans is useless if the bill passes & all the children & seniors will die from preexisting conditions 
thank you, senator, seriously. you go up every single time.
Do you know Lyme Disease is in 67 counties. DYK how these ppl feel? DYK many of this ppl are bedridden? DYK this ppl are in pain & depressed
Plz keep fighting the good fight
Thank you Senator Casey. So proud you are my Senator. I wish I could explain my fear for my daughter with MS. & Myself included with CIDP.
The reason my daughter is ok now are because changes that happened with the ACA. Its made it possible 4 me to work be productive care 4 her
But I need portions of Medicaid for that. Homecare workers will be jobless because very can few pocket. When they need institutionalized
Instead of being home. It costs huge amounts to pay the institution.
Let the senate know how hurtful this plan is. Shame on Cassidy-Graham
Yeah...just piss and moan ...dont present an alternative....you go Bobby.... #worthless
Go ,Bob Go!
Thank you.
Thank you Sen. Casey for representing the people of PA with conscientious care & integrity. So many rely on the ACA. #SaveACA #noTrumpCare
Thank you Sir
Thanks for all you do.
Give them hell!
Please watch this, and I dare you to oppose this.
Knock it on it's Ass
The GOP plan is a disaster. This is the perfect time to support Healthcare as a basic right. Will you publicly endorse Medicare For All?
Maybe mention if you support Bernie care or not! Maybe it needs to be tweaked.. Please tell us ur opinion!! 
Thank you!
Thank You
Thank you, senator.
I'll just leave this here.
Thank you Senator Casey!
Good luck sir
Speak loud & proud ~ thank you!
