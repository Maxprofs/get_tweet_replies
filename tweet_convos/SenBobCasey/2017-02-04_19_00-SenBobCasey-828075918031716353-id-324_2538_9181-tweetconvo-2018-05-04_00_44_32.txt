Thank you Senator
@l_tucc @realDonaldTrump 
I can't believe you are promoting this propaganda. executive order is constitutionally correct
GOOD ..DO SOMETHING>>>IMPEACH !!
@Mgivens61 @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrump
vote NO to Sessions Unfit to promote Justice for ALL!  Pa Indivisible groups growing at a rapid rate! 2018!!
I was a Democrat now an independent. Carter and Obama used the same Constitution
@WLD01 @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey Thank you Sen. Casey for standing up for America values. Toomey's silence is deafening!
do more than tweet. Filibuster scotus. They must vote on garland first
why don't you do something useful with your time and get prayer back in our schools
We support you! Keep fighting!
The attack is clearly your plain envy.  Get over yourself, do something to strengthen our country or get the f'ck out.
they are the last bastion to democracy everybody understands that the laws keep government in check
Congress needs to understand the severity of our situation. McConnell & Ryan R utterly clueless. The Constitution is in danger!
Thank you, doesn't  the others  know they  are going to live longer then this election. And the pastors, SHAM!
I CONDEMN THE FALCONS LOSING
The judge is supposed to uphold the law; not put forth his personal beliefs.  The constitution is clear.
:  @realDonaldTrump is privy to security briefings, the judge isn't.   Citizens' safety trumps "this isn't who we are..."
THANK YOU!
then vote against his scotus nominee
freedom of speech for everyone including Presidents,,sorry your butthurt
lol except for the press right??
I'm sorry but your liberals do it daily. try saying something good about someone it will make you feel better.
And condemn @SenThomTillis for the dumbing down of America
Well, do something gosh Damn It!
has one of the most popular tweets to @realDonaldTrump today - via http://PolitiTrends.com 
@bryanbarash @realDonaldTrump Censure Trump on this please.
OK so what have you been doing all this time then? Oh that's right. Sitting idly by as the country becomes shit.
You sir have my deep respect and appreciation for your service to our shared America
boo

Thank you Senator Casey. The majority is behind you
no, not so fast.  Trump is gaining ground daily.  Ind are switching to him as I write.
@madcat44 @realDonaldTrump
Thank you Sen Casey. Flad we have 1 PA sen. willing to stand up for America. @SenToomey  take notice.
@joy31608 @realDonaldTrump The judge is NOT considering safety of us citizens. We come before outsiders~esp vets & homeless
I fear our ill informed leader thinks this is an autocracy instead of a democratically elected republic.
Thanks Sen. C. As a PA resident, I implore you to continue to oppose @realDonaldTrump. He's a danger and an embarrassment.
thank you. Seems like contempt to me.
Thank you for defending us in the senate from the unjust actions of @realDonaldTrump
Thank you, Senator. We appreciate your voice and are depending on you to keep fighting like hell against dangerous DJT agenda.
What will you do, then? Thank you!
Then get to work on that impeachment paperwork, senator! We have a tyrant in the White House
Good on you, Senator. But words aren't enough. SHOW us.
SUCK IT UP, SNOWFLAKE. There's a new sheriff guarding the country.
Then grow a pair Sen. Casey and stop voting against what is good for working people. #twofaces
thank yiu you Senator Casey
Thank you Senator. You represent our great state of PA with integrity and intelligence
Thank you. He needs to be told loud and clear. not OK AT ALL. #Reckless #IllegitimatePresidency #Liar
Where r the rest of @SenateDems @SenateGOP in their condemnation! It's not about what DJT wants!
I'm so glad you are our State Senator 
@tllanes but did you object to all his appointments?
Thank you Senator.
I applaud and thank you!
@MATclinpsych @realDonaldTrump what can you Sen. Casey? You should be doing it.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump Where is the rest of your party?
Thank you Senator,sincerely,now what actions are you taking?
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump Thank you. Now investigate Russian ties DT business conflicts and vote fraud
THANK YOU Sen Casey for speaking up. Why aren't more senators doing the same?
@PaulBegala then go talk to your fucking colleagues on the Republican side who are continuing this party over country crap
all this talk means nothing if you do not filibuster scotus nominee.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump what ARE you going to do? We're watching & waiting!
Qualifies as contempt of court?
Glad to hear it.  So, what are you going to do?  Let's see some action. Not just empty words.  Impeach him!
impeachment will stop all of this and his Traitors in our WH
cry, cry, bobby
unless you push for contempt charges & possibly impeachment, not strong enough
WITH VISAS YOU MISINFORMATION PEDDLING NARCISSIST!
Please say this LOUDLY on the Senate floor.
Will you convince @SenToomey to vote NO to DeVos? @RoyBlunt can only follow & doesn't have the ability to vote for Missourians
can the Senate at least censure him?
Bob must not believe in safety for our families, children, LBGT, & women with this comment. This is why Trump won the election
Remember Nov. 6, 2018=33 Senate seats, 435 House of Rep seats, & 39 governorships will be up for re-election.
please do everything you can in your power to stop that monster from destroying our fair country!  @realDonaldTrump
thank you from this VA voter
Americans should sit idly by and let our country be overcome with immigrants? Shame on u !
then be a leader not a follower. Vote with America in mind. I am #TheResistance
Trumps attack on a federal judge is an attack on this country's constitution
Well people.need to do the same for him! STOP ATTACKING THE POTUS
Thank you for speaking out! 
He's been impeachable, but I'm guessing @SpeakerRyan has a bit more for his martyr to wreck first.
who are we exactly? We keep bombing! For What? Supreme failure to settle your differences! #paradiseoroblivion
It was not an attack. You Democratic politicians always talk in extremes to make your point.
Although it is true that Trump sometimes response will anger, his intent was to say that the ruling is unfair.
I am sure that with proper implementation of the executive order will keep ourco untry safe.
When a new executive order of this magnitude is implemented, there will be glitches.
So what if a few people were inconvenienced. I would rather have that than someone sneek in, & attack us.
thank you Senator Casey!
thank you for representing Pennsylvania! our other one is a spineless embarrassment (@SenToomey)
Thank You Senator Casey!
@MaggieJordanACN @realDonaldTrump God bless you for saying that. What is being done about it?
Then call for his removal. He has proved that he is unable or unwilling to fulfill his duties.  You know this.
Thank you, Sen. Casey. #Respect
#Dworkingreports
@MaggieJordanACN I am #TheResistance
Please vote to OPPOSE Betsy DeVos
@marcvetri @realDonaldTrump your side is very sad
@marcvetri @realDonaldTrump Thank you for standing up and having a spine.. we need more to follow! @SenToomey what's your move?
Thank you senator. Keep speaking up for democracy while it still exists in the US.
- Casey get real and protect America - have not learned anything from the past.
Thank you
So what are you going to do? #DemocratsNeedABackBone
thank you, Senator. Sad how many are revealing themselves to be weaklings who look the other way.
You need to be replaced
Well look who's puffing his chest!  You get a trophy
Thank u Senator. We must protect our Constitution. @GOP needs 2 take responsibility 4 this mess @Sheare_Bliss @realDonaldTrump
Judge Robart that halted the travel ban represents refugees in immigration cases.He should've recused himself.
Thank you Senator Casey. You make NEPA proud. The Trumpeter just embarrasses us.
please call him unfit to serve
thank you Senator Casey for standing up for what is right.
@elissafield @realDonaldTrump thank you. We won't either. We've pledged allegiance but he and his cronies clearly have not.
Thank you for standing up for the people of PA. Too bad @SenToomey only represents the $$$.
@DCFanCJ @realDonaldTrump We're with you, man! (UK) 
I will stand with as they come against you.
thank you Senator Casey
Senator Bob, you plan to attack President Trump on every issue. What's one more?
thank you Sen. Casey!
how unfortunate you lacked the #courage to "not sit idly by" when pres. #Obama did the same thing
Appreciate it, Senator. Looking forward to next year's campaign and your re-election.
thank you senator! Keep on! Much work to be done against tyranny
Thank you, Senator, for being a thinking member of the Senate!
@AndyRichter @realDonaldTrump Donald Trumpis a cancer on America.

He has got to go!
Thank you.  We need more to stand up against this so-called President.
I condemn Senator bob casey's attack on the President and commander-in-chief!!!!
@kharyp @realDonaldTrump
Go find a real cause to support.  Opening the borders to terrorist is all that you can stand for.  Really!!!
@jhiattsteele @realDonaldTrump thank you for speaking out against this tyrant who doesn't represent our values! #Resist
Always!
@AndyRichter @realDonaldTrump Thank you senator. Almost makes up for the wads of cash you took from big pharma.
THANK YOU @SenBobCasey #RESISTANCE #CancelTrumpsRealityShow @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #embarrassing #bannonspuppet
thank you for standing up to this bully @realDonaldTrump- my kids need positive gov't role models like you. Stay strong!
Wish more senators like you in time of democracy in distress.
Why r the rest sitting by not doing anything. Must country be destroyed before they do something.
Thanks to Trump, we are on hyper-alert #Resist #NoFascistUSA #amjoy 
@hopkins6_joe @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump
#ThankYouTrump This election was the icy wake-up call we have needed for years. #WeThePeople will no longer abdicate our duties as citizens. 
Did you condemn Obama for his attack on SCOTUS at the state of the Union?  If not your words mean nothing.
thank you for speaking out
we will make America Great again and Bob will lose 
then I expect you wont, and will stand up against attacks on the supreme court nominee.
Sir: Use every piece of political capital to get a few patriotic Republicans to vote 4 democracy. #DoNotNormalizeTrump #resist @SenBobCasey
why don't you try, really really really try working with the President? Help America!
yes you will. You and your colleagues are cowards.
thank you for standing up for what is right! -from a life long PA voter.
3 branches=checks & balances. TY Judge Robart, Ninth Circuit, and all in robes for upholding the rule of law.
Could you be more specific than "strongest terms?"
Are you kidding me.  That judge put our national security at risk.  You need to be voted out.
@AndyRichter @realDonaldTrump  Sen Casey is on the right side. Toomey is the coward, bought by DeVos for $60,000.
haven't seen you defend Judge Gursich from liberal attacks boycott bob

# Here's HITLER
Thank you, Senator Casey!
Russian spy can't insult the foundation of our democracy&go free, even the Russians call him a useful idiot
You're right, this isn't who we are, but it *is* who he is and that's the real tragedy of it.
@SenToomey Where's your voice defending our democracy? Thankyou, @SenBobCasey
So you are saying @realDonaldTrump has to sit idly by while liberals like yourself declare their ideas gospel
thank you for taking a stand 
We have had enough of the reckless and dangerous posturing of this administration. Time for CHANGE!
@Willie_American @realDonaldTrump
Please tell that to those we entrusted, that it's time to stand up to our so-called president
@AndyRichter That's a start. Will you vote to confirm @BetsyDeVos , she couldn't be any less qualified! Listen to the people.
@nycsouthpaw @realDonaldTrump I am sure you won't! BTW how many of his cabinets picks did you vote yes on?
@AndyRichter @realDonaldTrump  deeds not just words, Senator.
Did you condemn the violence at Berkely or NYU ?  Did any Democrat ?
@VetsForObama @realDonaldTrump if you condemn him you will call for impeachment. When will the day D.C. words turn into action?
@kharyp @realDonaldTrump Thank you!
#Obstruct! @realDonaldTrump
@AndyRichter why not? We had to sit Idly by while Obama drove our country 14 trill more in debt so suck it up like we had to.
are you going to let him put Gorsuch in the #SCT seat they stole from @POTUS44?
 Impeachment 

not just a whisper anymore
