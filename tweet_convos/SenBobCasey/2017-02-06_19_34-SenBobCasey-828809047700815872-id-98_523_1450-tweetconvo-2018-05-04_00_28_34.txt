The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast!
Impeach him
Thank you Senator for speaking out against a would-be dictator & danger to our country.
I would have to disagree.  The courts are the bullies here.  President is just fighting back.  Good for him!
Agree
@POTUS the threat to our country is to resort to bigotry & discrimination, which aids the cause of terrorism. @SenToomey
@TheDemocrats @CNNPolitics
Stupid. Read 1952 reg regarding emigrants.
stop throwing around that word, Senator. You ARE a Senator; not a schoolboy.
- now now he clearly stated he respects Putin. (*insert eye roll & my rage here)
A judge who legislates is against the law! Activist judge has no right overturning eo that protects the safety of Americans
You Dems bully every1 much more. Time 4 U to stand down. Quit lecturing.
Appreciate your speaking out and your representation. PROUD of my Senator. You back us and we back you. 
Agreed, DT needs to get out.
wrong
An #obstructionist Senate that will not confirm a cabinet is outrageous.  It undermines the function of government. #termlimits
um excuse me? They aren't required to approve anything. That is a functioning government.
Not required, but without votes it's a wasted effort.  Departments are not fully functioning without Secretaries.
So the President can't speak out about acts of the Judiciary but you can speak out about acts of the President?
What did your buddy obama do during a state of the union address a few years back to the Supreme Court judges  you Hippocrates
Weird I didn't see you tweet out after Mr Obama called out the Supreme Court on national TV
Disagreeing with a decision is not the same as saying the judge didn't have the right to make a decision
so when did he say the judge had no right to make it? I see disagreement, it's wrong, it's stupid.
Well, read Trump's tweets.
...stop whining and  get to work.
You can stand up for terrorists all you want. When they target you and in time they will. You won't feel the same way about 'em
well said senator.  This cretin needs to be impeached.
I'm concerned about Trump's rhetoric. If we have an "attack", I hope there's an investigation as to who instigated/paid 4 it.
@realDonaldTrump  Fear mongering! Stop! Even @realDonaldTrump can't stop ALL threats in America! Playing to base that loves it
- KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM & THE GOOD FIGHT! 
If only we had a "Real" President...
Trump is a carnival barker.

If any one get hurt, because of the judge's rule, then the blood is on the judge, not the president.
Thank you for speaking up for what is right.
As soon as it is humanly possible, pls fight to remove this deranged madman from the WH. We are all counting on you & others.
then act on it senator! File impeachment! Save our country!
When are you going to impeach the so-called President @realDonaldTrump for treason.
@SocialPowerOne1 #treason#impeachment
Speak up forcefully Stop pussyfooting Trump is dangerous and he subjects us to bad actors globally Wake up
You had nothing to say when Obama did the same thing.  Your getting voted out next year.  You're an embarrassment as my Sen.
#SchoolChoice for everyone.  The teachers union has a strangle hold on education.
@SocialPowerOne1 is It impeachable? Pls say yes !!

my 16 year old cousin was told to kill herself today bcuz her stepdad and lil bros are muslim. He serves in the airforce.
horrible. i am so sorry.
A senator doing his job once in while would be  nice vote him out
Trump is correct, where was your outrage when islamic terrorist are killing American citizens.
His acts are not unConstitutional! You are a liar!!! They teach the Constitution @HCOnlineCourses for free. Take it.
you're wrong on constitution,you know it or you're just ignorant,either way you're a pathetic career politician that must go
Enough of your lying Crap!
DJT is using propaganda to push his agenda.
There are some radicals in Islam but most are not. This just shows how illinformed he is.
Truth. Who is going to stand against this with more than tweets, though?
preach
Since Casey won't answer...could one you constitutional scholars on this thread explain what is unconstitutional about the EO?
this is real and calls for real action. ..come on bob ..get in the foxhole and fight to win
whats wrong with you guys give him rope, you're not gonna win this choose your battles
I'm starting to like you, Bob.
@Ldyforce6 1. He doesn't know what your talking about. 2. If he did he wouldn't give a shit.
@realDonaldTrump Please stop obstructing and confirm cabinet nominees.
And you, representing one branch of government, is criticizing another. Hypocrisy at its finest.
Too many have lied to Congress; have conflict of interests; and/or under qualified.
Yes, thank you. We've elected a dictator who wants to be a law unto himself. Where is @SenToomey in all this? #DefendDemocracy
(@SenToomey) is counting all the money rich folks donated to him & enjoying legal pay for play
Democratic Party will go down as obstructionist in 2017, and have done more harm to our country then any party in History
I gather it didn't bother you when the Republicans decided to block anything President Obama proposed
Thank you. 
We are Americans. 
Living in fear is unAmerican. 
Fear is Trump's stock in trade.
Well I guess some people are stupid enough to to believe your party's blatant  lies. Lol snowflakes are so delusional &clueless
@realDonaldTrump your the biggest threat America is faced with#bannonspuppet #PresidentBannonPayForPlay  #trumprussiapeepeetape
what's unconstitutional? Can't throw that around w/o explaining & contradicting liberal constitutional expert derschowitz
@POTUS 

The danger of a paniced response is chaos and, paradoxically,  less safety.

We need cool headed leadership now.
you won't be re-elected. So yes play your partisan role. division is all the democrats are good at.
Republican Senator Mitchell made it the Republican policy to object to anything Pres Obama proposed.
This situation is untenable, it is up to you & your colleagues to harness this threat to our survival as a nation. #ResistTrump
Thank you, Senator Casey, for fighting for what's right. As a PA resident, I am proud and grateful to have you as our senator.
Yes! Will your colleagues continue to stand for this?
thank you sen Casey for your courage and leadership!
He has ZERO clue how government works.  The judiciary isn't a recalcitrant subcontractor. He is unfit to govern.  Period.
why you are so negative Senator
, apolitical question. I have no comment for or against the ban, but what about it do you assess violates the Constitution?
, I am SO PROUD to be represented by you. You re-earn my vote day after day. Thank you!
SAME.
trump undermines our constitution and way of life! He destroys American values with every tweet with his micro fingers!
why won't you start the impeachment process? We need actions not words at this point! #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow
#ImpeachDonaldTrump
Courts have a 98.1% chance of winning........ Trump effect...... Trump wins!
He is not Presidential or American! He wants to rule like Putin. He is a dangerous man to our way of life! Hitler wannabe!
"when the president does it that means that it is not illegal"
thank you!!
But @realDonaldTrump wants to be a dictator.  They don't go by the old outdated rules.
If Democrats are so worried that extreme vetting will keep out terrorist maybe we should redo our immigration without them
TRUMP & RUSSIA !!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS BOB ???
