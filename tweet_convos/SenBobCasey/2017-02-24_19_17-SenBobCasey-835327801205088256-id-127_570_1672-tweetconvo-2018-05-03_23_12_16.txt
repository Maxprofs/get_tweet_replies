FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!
Trump asked RU to hack Hillary's email from the stage and they did - you saw it happen
T's lawyer and friend know to have promised cooperation with RU in return for Rosneft stake - big $$
*known*
Mike Flynn fired for colluding with RU before election and covering it up because it was a smoking gun
Manafort hidden away before election for being too close to the source of the deal
Priebus illegally pressured FBI to denounce @NYTimes reporting on RU connections when things got hot
how much more evidence do you need? Or are you so partisan that you can't see it?
@nytimes @CNN Senator Casey...rally the Senate to bring him down
thank god for president trump and the voters that still have common sense
As Ben Stein pointed out, GOP should have delegitimized @washingtonpost before they brought Nixon down. This is a cover-up.
Attacks on press freedom are un-American!
Yes they are!
no,what's sad Bobby is the fact you support illegal immigrants,sanc cities and refugees over Pa taxpayers,start doing ur job 
We want DT impeached, Sen. Casey. Please make it happen. -SWPA constituent
@DarrellIssa @FLGovScott @MassGovernor We MUST have INDEP. INVESTIGATION of Ties to RUSSIA. RECUSE SESSIONS!
thanks for continuing to stand tall on our behalf, Sen Casey
sen casey should be tried for treason
focus on the real danger so called president, the hate you are cause that embolden shooter in KC for example
your joking right if you libs haven't gotten it by now you never will
Get off the fake news about Russia and stop wasting taxpayers money
Seems Like He Doth Protest Too Much - Thanks Sen Casey for speaking out on behalf of greater majority!
Free press may not get it right 100%. But 'alternative facts' are deliberately telling fake information.
MEDIA TELLS THE TRUTH MORE THAN TRUMP! BY THE WAY WHERE DOES TRUMP GET HIS INFO?
Oppose this traitor every step of the way.
@AltUSPressSec @realDonaldTrump #SpecialProsecutor
Where was this so called credible investigation during the Dem primaries? #DemGone #StillSanders
hold a town hall you coward
only ones who fear our Free Press are those who fear getting exposed with the truth!! keep reporting.. TY
The fake pres is so demented that he doesn't realize this just makes him look more guilty.
. I am sick of Russia & Dem obstructionist agenda. Work together or quit, Do u understand what happened in Nov
Save us Senator.  Our country is on the brink of total disaster.  Every day he is in office he does so much damage.
your joking right? After 8 yrs of socialism your so funny
Stop obstructing and get to work.  You're only vocal now because you are up for re-election.
President Trump is SAD!  Can someone on his team tell him to shut up already! Ugh
it's nice to finally hear someone that makes sense after 8yrs of of listening to a total idiot
When does this madness stop?
They're not undermined. They can still report whatever they want to.
PATRIOT: a person who vigorously supports their country&is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors
INVESTIGATE the Trump-Russia connection! Your constituents are demanding it.
so sad!
@MaggieJordanACN @realDonaldTrump Thank you Senator
Do your job!  Ensure that there is an independent investigation of Trump's ties to Russia.
The so called POTUS is what is sad!
corporate media=/=free press. They serve their own interest, always have. Read any Chomsky Senator?
.@SenBobCasey .@realDonaldTrump Be clear, these are the priorities.#investigateTrumpRussia #followthemoney #StopPresidentBannon #TaxReturns
FREE PRESS HAH, BOUGHT & PAID FOR BY SOROS & COMPANY
Don't forget habitual lying by the so-called president. I would expect more integrity from that office
Sad is actually YOU MR. SUPERDELEGATE throwing your vote to the 2nd most unfavorable candidate in history the 2016 primary!
TY from a constituent. #triaspolitica & Intel agency stay focused on #russiagate & #MuslimBan #truenews #FreedomOfThePress
Everyday u make me proud 2 live in NEPA! Thank u 4 standing up 4 us!
Trump's ties to Russia must be INDEPENDENTLY investigated.
Put the tinfoil hat down, Bobby.  @realDonaldTrump
Thanks for the witty, insightful comment genius
Senator please stop dividing us. We people of PA voted Trump for change. Man up and get on board #MAGA
he wouldn't have been voted in if this were known then. Presidents are not above the law.
Bob, did you even listen?  He said FAKE NEWS is the enemy. Do you love fake news?
bob he is right. Just look at the coverage about #Vape. Total #fakenews and everyone knows it!  Sad but true
with all due respect the press and government has been lying to us for generations! #cannabis #Vape #wmd #war
We've heard "I have no deals in Russia!" How about Russian money here in US? Let's see the TAXES!!!
TY Senator Casey! Please fight for free press and free speech. Obviously intel is leaking to inform us.
@nytimes @CNN can't he be stopped???   What happened to our constitution??
Here's whats sad. You support a media that creates news rather than reports it. The media can't support one side with bias
#PutinsPuppet and #PresidentBannon are undermining the constitution. History will record them as treasonous.
No, here's what is SAD! You were actually elected to represent the people of PA!
thank you for standing up for right and reason.
Don't be sad. Trump can't accept the pressure of real press coverage.
Sen Casey, you are the best & we will fight to Re-elect you! If you find Toomey his constituents are waiting!
Supression of the free press is nothing less than Nazi tactics aimed at promoting lies & propaganda! WRONG!
NYT & CNN is not reprntng free press. They r Dem prty
Trumps right again- the media sucks. Don't need them. Drudge, Breitbart & Infowars get your news there
Investigate HRC & Podesta for Russia. They made millions. Clinton Cash & Uranium One
how is @realDonaldTrump undermining a free press?  They are still able to run news stories. 1A doesn't guarantee you access tho
what are you going to do about it?
it's all a ruse to cover up the truth!
@mizbeck @realDonaldTrump POTUS uses anonymous sources all the time ... or just plain lies ... your call
The mass Hysteria being displayed by the Left is quite entertaining. What's "sad" is believing your own BS.
Thank you @SenBobCasey @ realDonaldTrump
@nytimes @CNN My senator Rocks!! Proud of you @SenBobCasey
Sad is how biased you are & the degree to which you carry the water for Dems . 2018 can't come soon enough!
@nytimes @CNN keeping standing up for patriotic American values- #WeThePeople need & appreciate hard work! Defend democracy!
You tell'em sen casey.
acting as a dictator limiting free press, alternative facts , arms escalation, social intolerance, braggart!
is most hated in America. He's racing 2 disgrace & possibly Leavenworth. The media will b there 2 report it.
No your sad. Our country is falling apart and the politicians in Washington are playing politics as usual!
I am so tired of hearing fake news from DJT. He sounds like a broken record! U must really b hiding a lot!
hold @POTUS feet to the fire.  We want our country back!
you can't use credible and reporting in same sentence
pattern of avoiding the RUS questions,  time for disclosure and truth,  taxes are a good place to start. Money trail.
@BethFishReads @realDonaldTrump FAKE PATRIOT wants to do away with American Democracy. Minority president. SAD.
Media did this themselves, from Rather to Mika they destroy any credibility. POTUS uses this to his advantage.
(16001) when will talk stop and the action begin? How many rights will DJT trample before enough is enough?
I am reeling today. This administration is out of control and it will only get worse. This is not America. #ThisIsNotNormal
yes! Please repeat that louder for the people in the back #resist #DumpTrump
SAD is your NEGLIGENCE!Only theCorrupt support corruption@CNN
You're onlyconfirming who you R,that is SAD
the press is not sacred. Must stop the bias that offends us. Report the facts. CNN is lefts state run media
Fox News is far far right, and throws softballs at 45.  They are fake news.
@realDonaldTrumpSAD is your NEGLIGENCE!Only theCorrupt support corruption@CNN
You're onlyconfirming who you are,that is SAD

SAD is your NEGLIGENCE!! 
Only the Corrupt support
corruption@CNN
You're only confirming who you are, that is SAD!!

and his mouthpiece spicer who won't let real media in the press room!
What can we do as constituents to help reverse this authoritarian-style ban of the free press? #FreePress
I heard Rep Chaffeitz on NPR say he is still investigating HRC but has not facts to look at Russia, really?
Because republicans are interested in power not the good of the country
thank you Senator Casey!
when will Congress act ?  This guy is a bad Dude who is hiding something very, very bad.  Trust me.
Thank you for standing up to the orange clown. Still can't believe my state (and city) voted for him.
thank god we still have voters that has a brain and still can think for them selfs
please fight for an investigation to start.
We need to protest for it.  Like they did in south Korea.  Every weekend in massive numbers until it happens
Why won't the Republicans stop this!
keep investigating !
Stay on the case Bobby C !!  The Liar in Chief must be stopped
do you not have one nice thing to say to or about anyone?
what's sad is the complete loss of principle in what is calling itself the Republican party & Mr. trUmp
From a constituent in PA, thank you!  Keep pressing this, we need to know what he's hiding!
and the GOP helping him to cover up
- thank you, Senator Casey!  (From a constituent in SE PA)
I'm very proud of you. I knew your dad, and you when you were very young. He would be proud of you too son, he would.
your dad was wonderful, and Harris Wofford , those were great days
Trump really needs a thesaurus. Unhappy!
He is such a cry baby, hard to bel. A president
Keep pushing for an investigation into ties to Russia. This is all a distraction.
This is why I will work tirelessly for your 2018 reelection!
