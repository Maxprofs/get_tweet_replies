You have to pass the bill to see what's in it!
Right & Casey said nothing when that happened with ACA in 2009. Like the lap dog he is Casey blindly voted for ACA. ACA didn't affect him so
Oh, he didn't 'blindly' vote for it, that's what his donors told him to do.
Keep fighting the good fight, Senator. We are counting on you!!    #HoldTheFloor
Thank you for all your hard work, Senator.
@SenToomey Why don't you stand with the Dems and Pennsylvanians by voting against this health care bill. Your chance to be a hero!
Co Sponser the Safe Act,  stop the slaughter of America's Wild and Domestic Equines

You're a champ in my book!  Toomey is a loser.
Thank you Senator Casey and the rest of the Dems in the Senate for fighting against this unacceptable bill.
We’re arguing about seeing a bill before voting on it now. That’s how low we’ve sunk. (Thanks, @SenBobCasey)
I'll be speaking again around 8:15pm. Thanks for sticking with us, it's going to be a long night. #ShowUsTheBill https://www.facebook.com/SenatorBobCasey/videos/1365526823500467/ …
Keep it up @senbobcasey
Keep up the good work! Thank you!
We are with you!! #ShowUsTheBill
What do you want a pat on the back? Had you done your job and been knowledgeable about health insurance we wouldn't have today's mess.
Thank you!!!!
Just like #democrats showed America #Obamacare I remember it passing without a person even reading the bill! #DrainTheSwamp #Repeal #MAGA
Casey just woke up? Where's he been? Casey is lying to his constituents. Casey did nothing for the past 8 years of ACA. Now? He's pathetic.
This is still America, we champion free speech, press but they hide in shame this thievery as if we won't notice or care should be in block
@SadBeth1 Thanks Bob I write to you regularly
Thanks so much!!
Thank you for being the voice for the people. Dems seem to understand it's country before party. GOP will learn that in ballot boxes.
Thank you
Thank you Senator Casey.
You'll see the bill when it's finalized, you grandstanding fool!  Stop telling constituents that this process is somehow any different. #lie
@EJLandwehr thank you for our voices
PA hates you
Thank you, Senator! Keep fighting the good fight! #HoldTheFloor
Thank you Sen. Casey.  And please, send our thanks to all the Dem senators for never giving up and standing united.
Filibuster by amendment & withhold consent when that fails.
Stop the exporting America's Wild and Domestic Equines to slaughter in Mexico and Canada
We appreciate it, thank you!
Proud of you, @SenBobCasey! Thank you for your work and dedication to all of us in PA!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You truly are my hero!
Pennsylvania is with you, Senator! #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you @SenBobCasey for fighting for my patients
You probably wouldn't do this but if @SenToomey vote Yes, you should deny people who voted for him any medical care! Let him deal with them!
Thank you!!! 
#WethePeople appreciate your hard work fighting for transparency!
Thank you Senator!
Thank you, Senator Casey.
Go get 'em, Sir!
Thank you!  Keep it up until we see it AND have time to review
Thank you, Senator
Franklin Graham is 'disturbed' by christian Iraqi deportation. What  about christians without health care? They will die too. #Trumpcare

Keep up the fight, Senator!!

Take all the time you need, @SenBobCasey! We are watching you proudly in NEPA. #GOPsellout
Standing with you in #PA16. Don't let them take away our healthcare to give a giant tax cut to millionaires. We are counting on you!!

We are grateful for your opposition to this secret process
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator. Keep up the fight! #ShowUsTheBill
#ShowUsTheBill why? Your input isn't wanted. Your approval isn't required. We made the decision in November to #RepealObamacare. Get it done
You're all doing GREAT! I hope the Republicans show the bill before it's time for them and pence to vote on it
Thank you for standing up and taking action. As your constituent, I appreciate it.
Thank you, Senator!
