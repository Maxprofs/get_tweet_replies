no Americans deserve an accountable govt to the People of the US. Something you haven't been for far too long.
@tkdmike @POTUS Mahalo Nui Loa that's thank you very much in Hawaiian. More Senators need to write letters  like yours. Aloha
please ask @jasoninthehouse & @SenMajLeader to do same. @gop keep showing they care for party over country.
@45cea45 @POTUS Thank you! How much of our $$ will you allow him to spend golfing at Mar-a-wherever? Its ridiculous. #StopTrump
Conflict.emoluments.costly.Marsumthin must be infested->Russian bugs.Try Motel 6 very economical w/safer bugs!
You sure the bigs are safer? Hehehe...
.. Yeah, head lice, ticks, bed bugs, ants & American spy bugs minus golden showers!
you aren't required to adhere to insider trading laws. That is unfair. It is time to change that. @afavon440 @POTUS
no offense, but no one in congress is holding him accountable!  The time for action is now!
Thank you.  Deplorable that @POTUS is double-dipping by holding events at his clubs, while billing taxpayers for his expenses.
start the process of holding this man to account he is corrrupt and costing the us taxman a fortune #fakepotus
@realDonaldTrump Thanks for fighting the most corrupt administration in history.  45's days are numbered. #StayWoke #Disgrace
thank you Mr. Casey we need more senators like you to hold our president accountable.
Thank you, @SenBobCasey, for your important work to keep @POTUS accountable.
Get him, Bob. Get him.
Good on you, Senator.  We need full disclosure.  Thank you from Philadelphia!
@JillHelbling @POTUS PLEASE Sen. Casey...keep the pressure on.
We also should not have to pay for him to go to Fla. most weekends & security for sons' business trips & Trump tower.
. Good luck. Thanks for trying.
how much longer do we have to deal with this buffoon
@PrincessBravato @POTUS Can you start by getting his Taxes
@tkdmike Trumpians won't read this. It's too long for them and uses too many big words.
how many of u are free from financial conflicts of interests? Bought and paid for by LOBBYISTS. Be honest for once.
Thanks & keep up the good fight. Never stop asking questions & keep asking until a forthright answer is given.  #peopleshero
nicely done.  Thank you again for your truthful transparency!
THANK YOU SIR! NOW...#Shutdowngovt till #SPECIALPROSECUTOR #TRUMPRUSSIA #TRUMPRUSSIA #TRUMPRUSSIA #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia #45
We also deserve a president that doesn't use his office for personal gain for him & his family.
Please do. Trump is the most corrupt president in history. He beats Nixon.
@lburbo @POTUS Thank you for your integrity! It's good to know not everyone can be bought!
Why di d you not hold  the last administration accountable.When unemployment and homelessness was all time  high, ?
@BrianPaulStuart @POTUS Thank You!!!

Yes! Thank you!
thank you for this.  We have your back, please continue to have ours.
what the heck is the matter with you bob,  we all have financial conflicts,  get into reality,  except maybe you
thx senator. Now if u can get about 59 others on board....@SenateDems @SenateGOP
he needs to go, he is UNSTABLE . Article 25
don`t throw stones  bobby.  what is your life like
Casey you still can't get over he won. You focus on this liberal crap instead of working for all PA citizens
keep on fighting Senator Casey, I truly believe that he is also invested in the pipeline too! Thank you
Wouldn't it be nice if Democrats had the integrity to do their job for the country instead of chasing rabbis down holes?
thank you
Thank you, Senator Casey. This is so necessary.
THIS MUST BE SEEN THROUGH TO THE POINT OF INVESTIGATION, INTERROGATION AND PROSECUTION. Don't just do this a campaign ruse.
Thank you Senator Casey.
Please don't just talk/write about it and be done. Make this ur life project if it takes everything you got. You will be a hero
@ManyaZuba @POTUS trump will never
Thank you!
Thank you for taking it upon yourself to do the work of the House of Representatives. The House has failed to protect us.
Hold him to the highest possible standard we need him removed from power he is obviously afflicted with mental illnesses
Any other person would have been "outed" by now.  We need someone to lead by example.  The example we see is no ethics..
How bout you do your job for once and let @POTUS do his job as we see he is a GREAT PRESIDENT! #MAGA
grateful we've one Sen in PA who will fight for us. The other's too busy ignoring us. #impeachorange
At least he did something for the country and our economy ,vs you and your constant dribble and whining . back to bed
These conflicts are further evidenced by lack of full divestment & release of tax returns.
resigning would be in his best interest@potus or will go dwn history FOREVER as TraitorTrump TRASHING name forever @senbobcasey
hahahaha.  Thanks, I needed a good laugh.   Whewww.
What about his shadow POTUS Kushner. He's making foreign policies without a vote or confirmation.I'll send a link from Adam.
How has he not been removed from CoI alone? Corrupt president.
Thank you.
Thanks Senator, what other Democrats can we contact who are with you?
I stand behind you, Senator Casey. Thank you for shining a light- Time to think about the Country over self interests.
This isn't about colors anymore, but simply right and wrong.
trup is being openly corrupt cuz gop & his supporters don't care. He sees no reason to fake being upstanding.
When was the last time you created a job, Bob Casey?
GUESS YOU DIDNT HEAR THE ONE
ABT KUSHNER GETTING A HALF
BILLION LOAN WRITE OFF FROM
CHINESE??  E M O L U M E N T S
he won't. #impeach #treason #leavenworth #notmypresident #horriblerolemodel #RESIST #GoldenShower
@realDonaldTrump  Fight Fiercely Senator. If you can find @SenToomey maybe you can get him to join in the fight
f financial conflicts. we need 1 who doesn't act like he's a 5yr old psycho and destroys the country!!!!!!!!!!
it really infuriates me that @realDonaldTrump entertains foreign dignitaries @ his private estate instead of the WH/Camp David.
thank you - I have 0 respect till he does
this is great work Sen Casey! Also we need to work on bannon and his army of racists. #TheResistance 
Thank you, Senator Casey, for speaking up for what is right!
