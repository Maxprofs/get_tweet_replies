@HouseGOP & @TheDemocrats should get together & craft Health ins that is GOOD for the American ppl......that is what GOOD Government does..
Agreed and get the reps and dems to compromise and include patients, doctors and other health pros, as well as charm and insurance
Obama had AARP, AMA, Heart Assoc, & many many more involved with ACA.....@HouseGOP didn't do that
The GOP plan is just a tax cut for the wealthy disguised as healthcare
Wouldn't want to save any lives by taxing the 1% more! Not the pro-life party!
hypocrits
Yup and they claim to be Christian
As a Christian I find the ones that yell it the loudest and claim all they do is driven by their God,are the least Christian of all.
I find this true & am not Christian Driven by fear of actual living life Bible
2)seem 2 want 2 terrorize all those not afraid to enjoy life Threats of fiery eternal
3)afterlife drive them crazy Bad as fying to have all those virgins once dead
dying
Right or not, the sorry Christian Republicans will vote to pad their pockets and deny the poor the coverage they need!!!! Sorry @GOP
Just like Jesus did, oh wait no he didn't
These sorry Christians are blinded by $$$$ all they see or think about is $$$$$ thats it!!! @GOP and their ignorant followers vote 4 them!
hystrionics
Youre not my senator I'm IN NY. But as far as I'm concerned you are a united states Senator looking out for ALL of us. Thank you so much sir
Rand Paul & ted Cruz & co. Don't have a conscience to examine
Uhmmm.. NO
Hey Bob, did you notice @ChrisStigall's QT of your tweet?
I ask you to consider our children and grandchildren,  shoot for a balanced budget
 Perhaps you and the others could take a pay cut.
I don't work so others can have free stuff. I work to pay for my stuff. That includes my health insurance. Examine your conscience.
Keep fighting @SenBobCasey! #justsayno #alreadycalledtoomey #emailedhimtoo #ProtectOurCare #NursePractitioner #AllLivesMatter
Only problem with this argument is that it relies on the fantasy that Republican Senators have a conscience to check. #SoldToTheDevil
Democrats need to stop appealing to the "consciences" of Republicans. They don't have consciences.
I ask these Senators to examine their conscience. Is it right to tear away someone's care to pay for someone else's tax cut? 
You're assuming they have a conscience...
The Republicans have no conscience. You should know that.
I'm a Republican and this us down right embarrassing.  @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
Well then maybe you are a traditional old school republican with conscience, not one of these greed monsters
#MondayMotivaton #EidMubarak #Pesticides #SCOTUS #SupremeCourt #Pride2017  #stoparmingsaudi https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/stoparmingsaudi â€¦
Tear away? You liars claimed health care costs were going to go down. You didn't say costs would go up, taxpayers would be paying it.
Thank you keep our backs
You need to get off your fake high horse. You democrats treated us with your complete disregard for our health care and ruined all care
@POTUS says YES. Even his cult members are willing to see their families hurt for rich white assholes.
They dont care Bob, the sooner Dems start acting like them you/we might start winning again
How dare we give people their own money back?
ACA was designed to fail so they could force us into single payer and u c how well that's working in the rest of the world
No! It's not right! Senator Bob, please make them understand healthcare isn't where rich get richer. Many people will be hurt by them.
And what was PA Sen. Toomey's reply?!? Oh, never mind, he must support the US becoming an oligarchy. SAD!
@SenBobCasey. I'd love to shake your hand sir!Keep calling this Republican#DeathCare bill what it is. A giant tax cut fr 400 millionaires!
Are you going to work with the GOP to fix the healthcare bill?
#Amen #VOTE2018 THEY SCREW US WE FIRE THEM !!
The audacity of you after lies w/ increased cost/loss of doctors & plans from OCare to stand there and lecture! Taking taxpayer money too!
Thank you for representing the people of PA
Is it right for you to be exempt from Obamacare while we have to pay the high price. No
But is ok for me to pay for someone else's healthcare and you jack my price up so I can't afford it! Your such a 2- faced liar!
yea   why dont you fix tne mess then?
What A Baffoon, His Dad must be Ashamed
As far as I can see everything the govt gets into they f up. U ppl are morons for wanting more govt control.
EVERY Republican Senator has sold their souls to Ayn Rand!
SEN....MY PARENTS ARE SO SCARED!
We are the majority! It's time to stand up to these bastards and say Hell No. This is a democracy! We must resist! NO TAX CUTS Save our HC!
@pghpatrick1 I don't believe any of them have a conscience left.  They're willing to let people die to make the rich richer.
Senator, you are an honerable man. Thank you. 
Thank you for standing up!!
@SenBobCasey next one to go! Remember you got pass the bill before you see what's in it Bob? Dems created this mess! DEMS losing elections!
"Are there no prisons?"
"Plenty of prisons..."
"Those who are badly off must go there."
"Many can't go there; and many would rather die."
We need comprehensive healthcare not #wealthcare
Senator Casey! Please run for POTUS ASAP!! THE USA NEEDS YOU!
SenCasey you're not my Senator but I sincerely thank U for doing ur job by taking care of ur constituents unlike TX @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz
.@SenToomey
This ACA revised to satisfy the bitch and his crooked cronies must be torn up and started over , and I cheer you on bill  back on track!
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn in all fairness your lose finger signing GOP HC bill including @Gregg_AbbottTX would also sign ur political demise
Senator, we all appreciate your advocacy!  Would you consider rallying not just against the #AHCA but FOR #MedicareForAll ?
Is it right to levee a tax or fine on a person for not having insurance that does not cover their preferred methods of healing and medicine?
Where is the heart, Senators?
Who'll buy corporate prods & svcs if the lower & middle classes are spending their $ on healthcare premiums & expenses? #EconomicSuicide
The R crowd will say yes, Until tragedy or misfortune hits them directly Amazing how Americans change in time of medical misfortune
Thank you senator casey
I wish I could retweet this a million times!
I dont think they have a conscience.
Why is the @GOP killing Healthcare for a massive redistribution of wealth to the already wealthy people
A reminder that not only did healthcare not exist prior to Obamacare but also the sky is falling...
Stop scaring people!
Thank you for speaking out against this horrid bill, Senator.
I can not wait until 2018. #noCaseyForReelection ... No one here in pa likes you!!!
Can we make tax cut recipients sign a form saying "I understand people will die so that I can have more money"?
THAT'S ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED B4 U VOTE ON THIS BILL! @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
Sen Casey, It's not right to take from the poor and give to the rich.  Keep fighting for those who desperately need health care!
@PressSec @SenMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP Do you have a report on how many people you're projected to kill w/ #AHCA #BCRA?
Why won't you give us the same health care we pay for you to have?
Thank you!
US is a house divided against itself politicians R only concerned about next election & not the next generation quit fighting work 2gether
Is it right to force Americans to buy something they do not want?
US people whether Repub or Dems better tell our parties 2 work together or we thepeople will feel pain of their inaction &inability 2 fix HC
My roots N the Dem party go back 2 Harold Ford N 70s We used 2 work together 2 help the people politics has gone mad the people R the losers
Whether Repub or Dem our HC is headed N2 toliet & both R fighting against each other& we are the pawns that will get hurt Fix HC do Ur job
While I am not happy with the new version the bill only stops medicaid increase not do away with it Tell the Truth, work 2gether 2 fix it
Where's your conscious years ago when Dems destroyed our HC & dumped us N2 this mess We pay 4 your HC @ your exempt from the pain $Increases
@SenBobCasey @PatToomey , Prior to Your vote on HC, will U show Americans the health care a Senator receives so we can compare
Share Resist Bot! Text and Resist from your phone!
@moiskd STOP HURTING  KIDS EVERYONE. STOP  ICE. KID DEPORTED  BEFORE  PROM. CRUEL  IMPEACH  PRISON FOR  ALL  I  MENTIONED
I suspect that these senators, both the 13 who created this nightmare and those who support it, are lacking consciences in the first place
Thank you, @SenBobCasey. #StopTrumpcare
Is it fair that in the last 8 yrs debt doubled to $20 trillion & GDP to debt ratio went from 60 to106%? NO. America needs JOBS, not handouts
Thank you @SenBobCasey for speaking out against this travesty
So proud to call you my Senator, @SenBobCasey. No wonder that I voted for you!
You have no conciense
Where were you when Obamacare pass hmmm
They are not members of a civilized SOCIETY if they don't believe in supporting those who need help at a rough time of their life.
Senator Bob Casey I just want to say thank you! I knew your constituents could count on you!
It's right to get the federal government out of the healthcare business,leave it to the states or the people as outlined in our Constitution
Senator, when u examine ur conscience, are u and ur staff currently on obamacare? No, because u have special privileges.

@SpeakerRyan You have no conscience...amoral just like #trump !
If you can, Sir, get a copy of Friday nite's @Lawrence on #MSNBC w/ story of Mike & his Mom, Karen AND play it on the Senate floor
Are you sure they have a conscience?
I agree; it is not right. I don't know how they can do this! America will never be a great nation if we care more about rich people!
Give them hell @SenCasey. Lord knows, @PatToomey doesn't have the guts to do it.  His price in Hell will be glorious. 
Ask DNC to place countrywide ads in TV, Cable&Radio explaining the harm to voters of individual items graphically.
Did you examine your conscience before passing a health care act that punished working people for having a job. I doubt it
Yes, that would be Obamacare that has hurt so many people. From useless Medicaid to deductibles that are so prohibitive,no care
I'm in N.Y. but thank you for standing up for what is right here.
Keep after them Senator Bob. Your Dad is proud of you I know.
No, but when you've sold your soul to the devil, you are obligated to do what he says.
WE DON'T NEED TAX BREAKS. @SPEAKERRYAN
It's very 'UnGodly". God before country? But dollars before anything else? Trust in the dollar. Let the dollar trust in God?
Thank you senator.
Thanks 4 breaking down the bill. Been inconsolable 4 days & I'm not usually shaken. Tcare will legit kill me & my husband. We're early 60s
@SenToomey this man gets us, why don't you Toomey??
Stand strong and continue fighting for those of us who are not rich. Thanks for your leadership.
They don't have a conscience. Stop thinking they do. You're relying on them caring and playing by the rules. They don't and won't.
If it's cutting their taxes......isn't their money?
Please help me tell my current Medical horror story #Medicaid waiting for #Disability about to be #Homeless
Keep fighting for us!!!
You really are one of the good guys. Sen. Casey, thank you.
Was it right to lie about savings then take my money to give to someone else with Obamacare?
Now that is a good one-examine their conscience while you use this to pander to your base.with distortions and lies
Thank you Sen Casey! From 19066
Where was your "conscience" when you voted to put us in this unsustainable mess, Bob?
Thank you Senator Casey.
Come on Bob. When costs rose under ACA you said nothing. You said nothing because you voted to exempt Congress. You are campaigning now.
Costs rose due to THE BIG PHARM & HUGE INSURANCE CORPORATIONS! OUR POLITICIANS NEED TO GET CONTROL OF THIS SITUATION! !!
We are on the same page. We need the following to correct the situation: 1) campaign finance reform2) Reign in AMA &3) drug patents reform.
Hey Bobby what have you done for Pennsylvania today and you definitely are not your dad
Hardworking PA families paying high premiums and 1500 deductibles. What about them @SenBobCasey ? This guy is a joke!
Sen Casey they are heartless $&$$. They don't care!
Casey must go.He really is extremely partisan.He spews forth the divisive rhetoric of his sad lost party.
You must be confusing w/ @GOP and good for the wealthy Toomey
Sociopaths have no conscience- @SenToomey seems $$$ is yr God- SAD!
@TuesdaysToomey @WhatsPatUpTo
McConnell, Ryan & their lemmings have no souls.
It is UNconscionable and Amoral. Period.
They don't give a flying f*ck about anyone but themselves and the fortunes they are amassing.
It's sickening
@SenBobCasey my health care was fine before your party rammed through Obamacare. Now all I here is your mouth yapping about the GOP plan.
I don't like this bill 4 a host of reasons but PLEASE stop pretending these uncapped entitlements r sustainable at any tax rate
Bob, why did YOU take my mother's doctor away. Why did you tell her she could keep her health plan. EXAMINE your own reprobate conscience.
we want that tax cut dumbo
Our GOOD PA senator!
I just loved that comment!!! That's all you had to say! 
Thank You Senator... Thank God we have 1 Senator in PA fighting to protect us ... @SenToomey = Heartless, Lying Coward.
Keep up the fight for what is right!!
You are on the right side of history.
Go Bob go!
They're just performing their fiduciary duty to their shareholders.
ACA was  hell on earth  and  robbed eter to pay  paul   while  enriching  some interest groups  ,  am sue u know  those am refering to
Thanks for your efforts for sensible healthcare bill. Our kids need healthy future.
I don't believe they have a conscience.
Say Hi to Bruce Vento, Rudy Perpich and soul sucking Wellstone, Bob!
So it ok to take someone money for someone else ok got it Russian  thinker
Thank you, sir, from Pittsburgh!
Bob, wake up soul selling, Bob! Your judgement follows your puny assed life, Bob!
Thank-you @SenBobCasey . Appreciate you.
First, why is a tax cut needed? No justification.
Bob, Bob, BOB, cackadoodldoo; Bob!
Bob, you are lying through you redneck teeth, Bob!
Ask @SenToomey  if he is able to look in a mirror or sleep at night
Thank you from California, sir.
Pittsburgh resident here. Give 'em hell Bob!
241 sheep! Bob!
Bob, Bob Bob, cockadoodledo; Bob!
A valid suggestion, sir, assuming they still possess a conscience.
Fuck you, lying Bob! Prove me wrong! No Dem has a conscience or a soul! Prove me wrong, Bob!
They only want to examine their bank accounts.
Stay fired up! Loving your demeanor of late. Looks like we all got woke after November.
It doesn't control costs; nor does ACA. States need to do more to assess+handle its states' needs+costs.ACA must go regardless. Unaffordable
There you go again fearmongering!
We love you Bob Casey for speaking the truth, and telling the public honestly, what a horror this is!  #notaxcuts
Think I got a neck injury fm shaking my damn head everyday at Trump, cabinet & Less GOP house &senate.prexisting condition?being a mom is
I cured my lazy eye by rolling them so often
But for the vets, right? 
Ha ha ha is it right for you to fraudulently claim to represent the commonwealth of Pennsylvania?
And have constituents best interest
You do know that all members of Congress and their staffs have to use Obamacare, right?
tell Pat Toomey Pittsburgh would love to chat
So would Philey & suburbs Always no sho Never ans a phone
Keep fighting for us, Senator
Looks like VOTERS will have to end the #GOPdysfunction in Congress.  11/6/2018 all states can remove Repubs from govt.
Your party runs philadelphia which has public schools which are not handicapped accessible stop calling the kettle black
They have no conscience, Senator.
