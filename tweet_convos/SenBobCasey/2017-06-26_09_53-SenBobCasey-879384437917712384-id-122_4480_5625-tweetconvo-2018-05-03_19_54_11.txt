This class of Congress clearly doesn't concern itself with the lives of it's constituents it's very sad America has turned into thid
THISis because we Doctors *know* that #Trumpcare is not just mean, it's CRUEL

#AHCA
#Obamacare
American Medical Association comes out strongly against Senate health bill, says it violates “first, do no harm … standard on many levels” 
#Trumpcare should be renamed to #TrumpKillServices.
And they do it well!
Does @lisamurkowski know? #wealthcare
NOW call 202 224 4515 before 6:30pm ET TODAY! The Senate Com on Finance is counting requests for OPEN HEALTHCARE HEARINGS until 6:30pm EST
GOP doesn't care as they are beholden to their donors, not the people who elected them.
GOP Congressmen who were elected by their constituents....now trying to harm millions of their constituents. WTF are they thinking?
Doctors take the Hippocratic oath, GOP takes the hypocritic oath.
Why do this ppl need AMA to spell out the effect of this bill?
They are the authority, so hopefully the Senators listen?? If they listen to the idiots who wrote it, were screwed.
AMA is one of the main reasons we don't have single payer.  Lower prices = less money for doctors.
Medicaid/Medicare pay Drs less. But when private insurance gone, cost of dr's staff Won't need 2 deal w/ multiple ins companies paperwork.

Did the AMA ever apologize for organizing political opposition to the creation of Medicare, and weaponising the term "socialized medicine"?
It is a violation of human rights in the cruelest way!
Your doctors don't even agree with you now....SAD
as if anyone would trust or agree with @AMA - at least they're pretending to, :chortle: first do no harm. We need better PR not the @AMA. 
How much money do they want?
It NOT a health bill, it a tax cut bill. Period.
The AMA needs to focus on reducing health care delivery costs instead of the financing side.
Didn't your hear? Trump admin amended do no harm to "do no harm...to the wealthy. Rest are optional". #makehealthcaregreatagain
Why would a single Senator voted for a "healthcare" Bill opposed by the American Medical Association? 
Justification??!
Until they present a universal healthcare bill...all just steps sideways. Enough is enough. America 55 out of 58 countries. Embarrassing
This is the least @AmerMedicalAssn can do after it's endorsement of Rep. Tom Price. If we can all please remember:
For truly powerful views from physicians, look to their real professional organizations, e.g., @aafp @ACPinternists @AmerAcadPeds, etc.
So basically Obamacare.
Evidently the Koch brothers haven't read that
@billyeichner since when did the secret healthcare meeting include doctors, women or anyone that wasn't motivated by $$$$
wait until Obamacare fails and the planned single payer kicks in,see how they like their wages set by govt
@bndsnoopy61 Will AMA stop donating to the Republicans now, though?
AMA even says it sucks!!
Only GOP and Trump's tea drinkers want it. About a 1/5 of the nation - NOT a MAJORITY
@senrobportman: AMA says #AHCA violates their standard of doing no harm. @SenateGOP how can you justify health care plan that doctors can't?
tell them
McConnell will say "Actually it's 'do no serious harm to big bucks donors'"
Probably why the GOP didn't have any doctors in the room. #ahca #bcha
They lost that do no harm thing a long time ago.
Ahhh.. what do they know.
@robportman Are Ohioans more important, or are your insurance company donors? I'd love to see some integrity.
As an outsider, this bill looks like a proclamation of an American caste system. GOP reminding the 99%ers they're actually #untouchables
"Psh, what do doctors know?" (he says sarcastically as he bangs his head against the wall)
@SenatorTimScott American Medical Association is against BCRA
I'd like to put more stock in this, glad the Doc Union also opposes this, but AMA is a labor union that lobbies, why deny this?
GOP does not give a flying f***.
How much higher could cost be then they are now. What would alternative be?
It's #ReaperCare
I'm going to invest in a leech farm. Medical trend of the new coal-powered "future"

And THAT isn't enough?  The AMA is against this money grab. This is incredibly embarrassing for US.
#AmericanDeathCareAct #ADCA #KilltheBill

Shorter @DrNealDunnFL2: First, do no..... oh, never mind.
The AMA is a restraint-of-trade, anti-trust cartel.  I value NOTHING it has to say.
Kind of undercuts arguments that MDs in #congress are making as supposed experts.
They need to stop calling a "healthcare" bill and call it what it actually is. a tax break bill for the wealthy and insurance companies.
Healthcare is just where they are getting the money to pay for it.

republicans want to hurt people so they can get their money?…..theres a shocker.
Reminder: @AMA represents less than 25% of doctors.
How can they pass a health Bill that #AMA does not support? Doctors have power+they need to use it!!
Let me stop you right there and first say that @SenateMajLdr is anything but 'honorable'.
@senrobportman are you listening?
Freakin' science-obsessed libtards!
Who should we believe?  AMA or paid off GOP grafters?
That's a tough one.
It says Honorable Mr McConnel ... honorable? Seriously?
Do no harm? I see ER patients barely treated— just passed off because of poor insurance plans. This is #americanmedicalassociation BS
Which Dr. Group Supports #Trumpcare?
If you think it's bad now Imagine if 24 million lose their health insurance
#AlternativeFacts #FakeNews
So now they can add the AMA to the CBO, AARP, VA, INS CALC, and dozens of others that are treating Trump so unfairly & are fake news
Important but doesn't change that we are in a post-expertise world now. Remember that every newspaper editorial board advised against Trump.
The Dr is 'do not harm' not the insurance companies, therefore how can that apply to an insurance company
Do @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr know more than the AMA?  Or do they just want to feel it in their own pockets?
Well we have some blackhearted s.o.b.s at the helm so there...will...be...harm...done.
If so concerned about doing no harm doctors should donate 6 months of services to those in need instead of building their 2nd, 3rd house?
heh, doctors. like they know anything about health care.
Or women know anything about our own bodies. Phfft
This is why the seditious cabal AKA the @GOP shall be called the Death Party, should be removed from governance entirely, serving no use.
You nailed it...
@Senate @Congress @RealDonaldTrump @POTUS @ABC @NBC @CBS @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews REMEMBER TO DO NO HARM? GOP HEALTH CARE HARMS  $800 BILL.CUTS
And @SenatorCassidy responds how??
Thank you AMA. Time for insurance companies to step forward and denounce the bill.
They will when people can no longer afford to pay into their scam. #SinglePayer
@PatToomey CRUEL
GOP doesn't care.
Finally, my reasoning exactly, & they must advocate for US ppl.  Can AARP&AMA sue AHA& GOP over this?
@Rhino184
Won't persuade the Randist Party. She denounced whole idea of health policy that places patient well-being first.
American Medical Association comes out strongly against Senate health bill, says it violates “first, do no harm … standard on many levels” 
Here @SenToomey-read it for yourself and then try to lie your way out of it. U have eroded the trust of the ppl in PA. U have no morality
@realDonaldTrump @marcorubio AMA people, AMA!
Feds cut, states reduce payments to MDs. People suffer and die.
It will end Up in the Courts for illegal Activities by Trump and those who follow this path Vincent and I agree @ACLU @tribelaw
@SenBobCorker @SenAlexander Are you listening? The AMA says this bill violates Hippocratic oath to "first, do no harm." NO on #Weathcare
Why are these doctors so "hysterical?"
They're afraid they'll lose business when people can't afford to see them.
I was being sarcastic.
Really?  What do doctors know anyway?
@SenToomey, you should probably listen to the professionals, not your donors.
@JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @robportman @DeanHeller @JerryMoran, this is a must read! Please think of the ppl you represent and what it means
Those arrogant Senators know much more about medical illnesses&treatment than any dr. The Rep&their child Pres are driving most of us insane
You should be investigating Hospitals and physicians who take bribes over lives. Its a form of first degree murder

#DONOHARM @senatorcollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @JeffFlake @SenToomey @DeanHeller @CoryGardner @SenBobCasey @robportman @SenBobCorker
Ha! What does the American Medical Association know about healthcare? Leave it to the professionals. /s
Unfortunately, "First, do harm" is the @GOP's motto.
Yeah, but they promised the American people "First, do harm."
@marcorubio still not ready to make a public statement?
Because he's a coward.
These ratfuckers are going to pass it anyway
It also violates the "don't be a dick to your own people" standard
Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm.

GOP Oath: You can't make an omelet for a rich guy without breaking a few sick eggs.
Shorter version of GOP oath: "Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all."
Yeahhhhhh. You tell em Libtard!!!!
These MFers....

Repub Rand Paul Argues That #TrumpCare Won't Reduce Premiums, So Just Eliminate Coverage...this guy is a doctor?
