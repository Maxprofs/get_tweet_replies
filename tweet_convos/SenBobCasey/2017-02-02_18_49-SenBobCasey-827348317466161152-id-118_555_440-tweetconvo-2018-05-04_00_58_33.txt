.@SenateMajLdr wants to cut off debate on Betsy DeVos's nomination but constituents still have questions about her views on public schools.
.@SenateMajLdr & @senategop can have 6:30am vote if they choose, but it’s not early enough to sneak one past the people of Pennsylvania.
Having a vote on DeVos before the sun comes up won’t paper over the serious problems with her nomination.
As a person with a disability, i'm scared that DeVos could head Education and be ignorant of #IDEA. Thank you for your support.
#dumpdevos
You are a wuss just like your dad.
You better support Mr Trump or you will lose my vote in next election!
Please keep fighting for us. We need you more than ever! And let us know how we can help!
@GOP in general is doing EVERYTHING possible to make POOR choices for our country! We are watching!
Thank you for listening and standing up for the people in PA! I hope @SenToomey is listening as well. #saynotodevos
Evil Republicans must be voted out! See what happens when you stop listening to the ppl!
So you oppose cutting off debate when your party isn't in power, eh, Senator?
This GOP regrets the loss of my party's integrity...it went South!
gutless...spineless... dirty handed. #noDevos  #VoteNoDevos
support my President
I thought they were gathering in Florida meeting with investors
And that’s the way we like it, uh huh, uh hug.
that's because @SenateMajLdr & @SenateGOP are spineless cowards #noDevos
@GoingPublicOrg @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Right when teachers start working! Dirty!

you're doing a great job Senator Casey-  hold firm!

Very sad, especially in light of constituents' calls and concerns.
Thank you Senator Casey for voting for what is right. Our children are our future
GOP musn't care abt the ed of a generation of youngsters.Do what you can&must to stop this travesty.
So sad.  The PEOPLE can't even get thru to @SenToomey to be heard. This is democracy?  NOT!!
@SenToomey   Toomey and GOP unAmerican & disgraceful
- Stop this woman from buying our schools.  Our children are not for sale!
@thereallisababy @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Tell those idiots we have alarm clocks, too!
@AltGlacierNPS @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP isn't this what Dolores Umbridge tried to do to Harry Potter
I am praying she is NOT approved! She is NOT qualified!
Corrupt
"A politician thinks about the next election while the statesman think about the next generation."
I wish our house and senate were filled with statesmen instead of partisan politicians.
Do the right thing Senators. Vote NO on this unqualified nominee. Our children deserve better.
THIS IS NOT OKAY. She is clearly an inappropriate choice!
A woman who can't spell, write & plagarizes Vanita Gupta &lies is in our country's best interest how?
There better be a Dem down there to #WithholdConsent!
@ACLU Is there a way to charge @MitchMcConell  @SpeakerRyan with treason based on dereliction of duty?
@halseanderson @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP The People demand you maintain a transparent process. So much depends on education.
I'm from CT but I thank you for taking this seriously #noDevos
Another odd hour move like 2 years olds having a temper tantrum
Thank you for keeping us posted Sen Casey - unlike your MIA colleague @SenToomey - the voters remember
@pizzmoe @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Their scheming knows no end. Surprised they didn't go for a 3am vote.
Thank you Senator Casey for being the stand up gentleman, doing the right thing & supporting our kids
#noDevos thank you Sen Casey for working for our kids.
Vote No on Devos!
I'm not sure I have ever seen such desperation to push something through they know is weak.
These people are the worst. I don't know how you and your fellow Dems. can deal with them. Aggravating
so much winning going on you just can't keep up,Trump has base and majority of independents on board
How about you suggest your "colleague" Pat Toomey vote no. #NoDeVos
GOP needs to steamroll right over you left wing nut jobs
Of course they are, #DeVos paid good money for her appointment! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-donations_us_5893bd80e4b0c1284f251c5f … @SenToomey
Cowards! Vote during business hours if you are proud of your vote for this unqualified nominee!
The Republicans are full of all kinds of trickery!
@FoL2009 @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP 
As usual, Republicans have to cheat to get their way.
@Lindafblue @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Vote NO. Vote NO. Vote NO. Children =future.
I hope you set your alarm!! Hope @SenToomey shows up and represents his constituents.
can Dems withhold consent to stop this?
Keep fighting Sen Casey. Shame on the GOP who disrespect the people. #NOTNORMAL
@SenToomey All cowards hijacking the future.
Thank you for taking this stand for your constituents, being on the right side of history. Proud to have you represent PA
omg those sneaky underhanded people.

@SaysSheToday @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP might as well be 3am slinking like snakes in the night
@payoungdems  fight changes to Medicare that are coming
the senate republicans will be accountable for each and everyone of these nominees going thru #2018
VOTE FOR...
Mr. Casey you sure are going against all those who showed up in Nov to vote against you. #uroutin2018
Where is @SenToomey ? Not answering constituents.
.@SenBobCasey @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP since she paid for it, she expects a return on her inversion.Who cares about anything else? #traitors
Thank you for respecting your constituents enough to keep us informed. Shameful behavior, @senateGOP!
6:30am huh? Well the earlier we vote no to Devos the better!
@tomashbrooknpr @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP They realize she's on a razor's edge and want to ram her through like the others.
that's bcs he's a coward @SenateMajLdr hear the people! You work for us! Not lobbyists
@SenToomey Can you persuade Toomey to vote no? He won't listen to us! He's horrid!
@SenToomey We can do better than DeVos! The American education system deserves better.
@LombardiTime @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Will @SenToomey be there? His  Phone/fax lines have been busy signals for 3 days.
DeVos is not an educator and has demonstrated she has no business at the DOE much less head it!
Vote NO on #devos As a public school teacher, I request you allow my students a fair edu
Per http://Faxzero.com  @SenToomey has been sent more than 11,000 faxes in the last 7 days
really- the democrats would never do anything like this to the republicans. Lol
Knew @SenateGOP were gonna try something sneaky to push DeVos through - and why does Sessions get to vote? #ConflictofInterest
Good they should have done it days ago.
Thanks for standing up for kids of PA.  Devos is not a good candidate for Education.  Fight on!
So they can vote before emptying their flooded voicemails again? NO TO DEVOS!!!
vote no on DeVos
loser; your days are numbered
@SenToomey  Shameful. She is not qualified. We will remember this. 2018.
@SenToomey Pat Toomey will vote for DeVos. A very sad statement indeed
our kids deserve better, our other senator @SenToomey won't even answer our calls and listen to us!
#BetsyDeVos is a death sentence for #publicschools. Please vote no. She's unqualified.
Fight for our children, @SenBobCasey! Your constituency thanks you. #DumpDevos  @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP
that sounds like McConnell slime tactics
have you see @SenToomey ?  I know he loves Koch. We can't find him. Tell him to vote no. Not Koch.
I can't believe that the leaders of the Senate care so little for our kids that they would push DeVos
Please remember 3+ million people are voting in 2018.  We don't have short term memory issues.
thank you for not supporting DeVos in Education-she would be a disaster for our children.
I'm absolutely disgusted. I hope there are defections from GOP. She's NOT RIGHT FOR JOB! #StopDeVos
Shame!! Harming the youth of this country! DeVos will cause irreparable damage!
they are scumbags. Vote no for that ill-prepared, arrogant, no nothing woman. NOT suitable. Shame!
hang in there!
#withholdconsent #nojusticenobills #Indivisible #TheResistance #TuesdayswithToomey
Tow the line, Rs. Disgusting. Put another billionaire with no practical or real world experience in.

Please go twist some arms, Senator.

Cowards
