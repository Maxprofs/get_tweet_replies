I'm embarrassed you're from my awesome home state.
.@his_natrgrl You should be proud that @SenBobCasey has the guts to stand up to the illegitimate & anti-American @realDonaldTrump. #Impeach
Dems are anti GOP at all costs. Temper tantrum bc HC lost.
.@his_natrgrl @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump I'm not a dem, but anti-GOP definitely. A shittier, more compassionless group has never existed.
Facist? Look in the mirror
is that "I know you are, but what am I?"  Playground insults like trump hurls.
please, what did conservatives do when we lost the last two? How many riots? No, we took back seats, gov.s and potus. Wahhhhh
you mocked hanging Obama, there were riots?  Were you under a rock? Google it, you dingbat!
.@SenBobCasey The horrifying @realDonaldTrump and his theft of the Oval Office is reprehensible. Keep opposing him!
Theft? Insane much?
.@kansas6453 @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump What else do you call 74m votes against & only 62m for? With Russian involvement? Treason?
As a Hillary supporter, I would like to know your source. Where did you find 74M?
65M voted for Hillary and another 9M voted for a 3rd party candidate.
Thanks for pointing out that there were 9M others who didn't vote for Trump.
Happy to do it. Trump got his ass kicked and I remind him every day.
if you do not vote against everything this fuckin guy puts forward, do not count on my vote next election
what if he literally pushed for healthcare for the poor?
I'm not playing this game
haha.. the thing is, trump is no unpredictable

if Clinton could transform Dems for the worse
keep hoping he is going to change, and I'll keep hoping to find the yellow brick road
Dems need to rise up, and I hope it's a movement from the left. but corporate Dems fear that the most
the Dems are a joke of a party
Listen, Liberal is a great book.. really talks about when and how they went wrong
@FightingMad1 @realDonaldTrump What did was the best ever done by a President! The best ever. Period!.
I am THRILLED you are from my home state. Thank you for your voice of reason and reality!! Please don't stop
That's a great start. Will you keep it rolling by initiating impeachment proceedings this week? #traitortrump
, Thank you Senator for calling out these unbelievable acts. Encourage your colleagues to do the same.
Casey-you are a nutjob
how did he get to his phone or PC? Take them away, no he is doing damage to himself #TheWholeWorldIsLaughing
send do not initiate impeachment proceedings just saying
Thank you Senator Casey
Thank you Sen. Casey for standing up for what is right!
Impeach?  Maybe the Senate can convict?  That would right this wrong. And I don't even like Mike Pence.
Would Pence not be as bad? These days he seems to be getting right in line with Trump & defending his bad actions!
Thank God the rule of law is bigger than Trump.  I can wait to see him impeached!!
@sumoh7 @realDonaldTrump No one is mad over the election loss-we believe that Trump is insane/danger to the world-clear enough.
why did the federal judge in Boston come to an opposite conclusion?
Bobby Casey, stepping up to the plate. Thanks man, keep making Pennsylvanians proud!
Americans screwed without even kiss!Gave Mien Kampf Trump pass fraud &corruptions plusPresidenc
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS GUY
YES now get a panel of independent shrinks to commit him. Or believe him on voter fraud and void election.redo
@TimOBrien @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump not in his book.
I hope you're right. There is so much that we will lose, have already lost.
Thank you Senator Casey for your integrity and strength.
@dollyllamaX @realDonaldTrump whatcha gonna do about it. Yeah that's what I thought
I wish Dems stood for the rule of law 2008-2016. If you did (& had fair primary) Trump might not be POTUS.
#TricksterTrump is UnAmerican
we the people would like more access to our elected officials!  How about real town halls? Why u hide?
Reprehensible indeed, like the man himself.
Senator Casey, I am filled with love for you and your team!  Thank you for being my hope!
@PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump I would say it is #ImpeachTrump
And the overwhelming majority of Americans who cherish our constitution agree! Thanks Sen Casey for fighting!
@POTUS Agreed! In less than 16 days Trump made the USA the USB - the United States of Bigotry. Shame on him!
What @SenBobCasey is doing to the country is reprehensible, you communist. @realDonaldTrump
#Meocons have practically rewritten the legal code, like legal rape, it's tme to #resist their corruption of democracy
@kharyp
Holy shit. What now?
The rule of law is not set by the democrats although you try to alter the constitution that's way Trump won
Then why did another judge rule differently. The judge reportedly has a social justice record of rulings.
Only today? We have 15 days (which feel like 15 years) worth of reprehensible.
yet you support sanctuary cities,you're a disgrace to our country,no patriot, caring more about them than us
The constitution is bigger & brighter then @realDonaldTrump can even begin to imagine
So when are we going to enforce the immigration laws which Obama ignored? You are reprehensible.
Y is today different than everyday? @BethFishReads Not 1 day goes by without @realDonaldTrump doing something reprehensible.
I totally agree with you @SenBobCasey now we shld get @realDonaldTrump to see a psy cuz he suffers from a severe narcism disorder!
Thanks Senator, keep up the pressure, Donny's going to crack.  Persist to resist.
you spelled "does everyday" wrong
why didn't u have that kind of passion in protecting our 4 borders instead of illegals who are not citizens
hey Mr Casey get Toomey to vote against Betsy he turned his phones off. Forgets he works for PA not Trump
Democrats wouldn't recognize the rule of law even if it walked up and smacked them in the face
and combined with his statement to Bill o'Reilly it's quite treasonous. #impeachTrumpnow
Absolutely reprehensible. Without question.  Un-American and disgraceful. His childish rants have gone too far
@ThreeTouchDowns  THANK YOU SENATOR!! NOW GET RID OF HIM!! #TREASON #TRUMPLEAKS #PUTINSPUPPET #TheResistance
it's bigger than activist judges in pussy hats shouting blm #alllivesmatter
the operative word is "today". Soon to be replaced by "this hour".
Plz ignore "Jill." She doesn't speak for your PA constituents. We thank u for taking a stand for our country.
p.s. "@-ing" someone twice is awkward because it is redundant and wastes characters.
@AnnH1958 @realDonaldTrump  Trump is an Ignorant and arrogant guy! Simple like that! Now for him THE BEST IS TO RESIGN!!
Thank you for taking the sensible approach!  Indeed this is what makes America great!
@PayDownTheDebt @realDonaldTrumphe is a disgrace to the world I'm a shame
its time to impeach him, He is turning the United States into a bulls-eye for hate
@ragdog1 @realDonaldTrump #Impeach #Train-wreck
What a joke. Democrats hate the rule of law! It's why Trump won. Hello @realDonaldTrump
You need to stand up to this dictator Sen Casey!!  Be brave and do the right thing
#truth
@jaredlmink is a Russian bot.
@resist_nv @realDonaldTrump The KING has spoken. SO LET IT BE WRITTEN SO LET IT BE DONE
Thank you @SenBobCasey for standing up.
Our "So-Called-President".  We stand behind you Senator.  The majority of people have your back. Majority.
thanks for all your hard work for us, Sen Casey. Some people can't get past their privilege to appreciate it.
you're a racist with you privilege hate speech

crying about privilege like a person can help if they are brown or white, born into rich or poor. Playing God #pathetic
do you even know what you're saying? Go home, Troll, you're drunk.
20 followers YOU are the fucking fake ass troll. It's not  been a privilege
Treasonous? http://www.dictionary.com/browse/treason

the people are bigger than Trump's ego.
it is core to the creed that makes this nation great.
