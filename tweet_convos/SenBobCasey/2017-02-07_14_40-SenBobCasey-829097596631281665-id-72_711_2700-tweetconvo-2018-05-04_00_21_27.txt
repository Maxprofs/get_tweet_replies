The Kid has been brainwashed.
@rockysolid82 Name calling a 7 year old for thanking someone for being nice. Stay classy.
I wasn't name calling. Learn to read.
i know the mother of this child. She is my friend and her children are wonderful, caring kids.
The mother obviously TOLD her Child to write this. THAT is my Point. Untermensch.
the other two kids drew pictures 4 our home about being kind & thankful to those who R.
Very nice........lmao
laughing at parenting 7 year old & teaching them kindness and empathy... please think.
@nameAliG Is this Charlie's letter???
yes!!
its never too early to get them started. Activism has no age limit!
. Where's your pussy hat? Lmao
. Awwww....little dumb dem in training....awww.....
yes and when one terrorist comes into our unsecured borders and kills or harms a 7 year old what then???
:Charlie has more sense than trump
@K_rol1n4 ohhhhh that is so thoughtful!  Thank you Sen. Casey.
@LouiseMensch Dictated to by mum and dad.
more fact checking in #NoBanNoWall for ye :) https://youtu.be/pSPvnFDDQHk  #talk
using a letter that some liberal forced their kid to write. Nice touch
@SenateDems Great letter! Keep up the good work!
Please keep fighting for us, Senator Casey. We need you more than ever.
.@SenBobCasey, I know Charlie and I know you. I think you both are pretty darn awesome. #KeepGoing
mom and dad told him what to write. Who are u kidding
Thank you Sen. I'm proud of you and your dad would be too! Keep standing up for America and what is right!
Shame on you Bob Casey for perpetuating the lie that the extreme vetting is religious based, rather than state based. SMH 
Thank you for voting NO against DeVos senator. We wont forget. Tell Toomey we wont forget that he voted YES either.
Pretty sure that Charlie's picture should be your new Twitter header @SenBobCasey. Thanks for continuing to make PA proud #resist
Thank you, sir, for staying up and trying to do what is right by our children. It will not be forgotten.
@SenateDems The children are watching...
@SenateDems awe
I like you too!!
....you are nothing more than a mouthpiece for Chuck Schumer and George Soros.
You lost Waahhhh.
No, America lost. Money won. That's the conservative version of the American Dream, buy my spot!
so disgusted! Please don't let all sins of this admin get swept under rug. Keep fighting for us. @SenToomey is a disgrace
thank you Senator for caring about our kids
children learn what they live! The children are watching. My grandson thinks Trump has three First Ladies (married thrice)
you are appreciated. Thank you

- You are a hero in my eyes! Thank you!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump @GOP Even a 7 yr old knows it's  wrong #SCOTUS @TheDemocrats #NoBanNoWall
After the way you conducted yourself, the 7 year old could do a better job than you. That's sad. 2018 is around the corner.
Sweet Charlie! You have a wonderful heart! Many blessings on you thru the years. 
A seven year old gets it but not the President?  Who's smarter? #NoBanNoWall
when kids make more sense than Republicans! Is this a joke?
the kid voted for you?
@SenateDems thank you senator Casey! Glad to be a constituent!
precious.
@SenateDems Thank you for voting NO on DeVos. A sorry day for Americas kids
Many 7-year-olds have more vision and understanding and patriotism than all the GOP rolled into one. Good job, Charlie.
Right, trying to isolate us from the world hurts us all, our strength has always been immigrants- why not strengthen vetting???
@SenateDems So sweet!
Thank you for all you did to fight DeVos as Sec of Ed & immigration ban. We will keep fighting.
There  are  children homeless,  and dying  of starvation in your  state and u are showing us this fake letter.. Who cares?
Please tell us how we can be most effective fighting the immoral WH and GOP Congressmen??
Your typical approach, who wrote it Nancy or Chuck?
I'm with Charlie
Senator, you've made me proud, and there's still plenty of crap trump picks to oppose. Toomey has been a disgrace. Dont give up
@SenateDems there is no ban (90-120 feeeze) and there is already a wall...
@SenateDems Can we change the voting age to 6?
Thank you Senator Casey
@SenateDems to bad Georgia republicans don't agree hopefully they won't get a return visit to the senate. Change is in motion
thanks bob for being on the side of cowards that won't stay and fight for their country. You're the beta cuck champion.
Out of the mouths of babes, thanks for all you do!
@SenateDems 
Whenever a note like this is written somewhere a repub. gets more #liberaltears to drink.i hope they CHOKE on them
They could if they knew how to read. 
Please clone yourself and replace Toomey with the clone.
and to the people  who  lose loved ones that  you and and  your terrorist  protesters are  spitting on their grave u say what?
Cute!
WOW! So sweet!
thanks for fighting. @SenToomey should be ashamed of himself. She was exposed badly! Our children deserve better!
not worried about refugees harming my children. The new Secretary of Education will. You are a disgrace Toomey!
Thanks Senator for staying up all night--appreciate your efforts!
thank you Senator Casey more sense than @senatorrobportman
REBECCA YOU ARE DRUNK.
