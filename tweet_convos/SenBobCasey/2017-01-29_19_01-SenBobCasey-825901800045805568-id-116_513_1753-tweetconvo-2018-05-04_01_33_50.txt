By trying to be "tough", President has shown himself as weak on immigration
@MMFlint Sen Casey is standing up! Thank you!  I call upon @CongressmanGT and @SenToomey, my local PA Reps, to do the same!
Thank you for representing us citizens of the Commonwealth and the values of the USA.

Thanks! We appreciate your courage.
Thank you @SenBobCasey @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain !!!!

thank you!
Is this a permanent ban? Or only a temporary ban for 90 days?
glad you've taken a stand.  Wish you'd been more forceful and said something directly, beyond "I stand with..."
thank you for standing up for American values @realDonaldTrump this is inhumane!
sorry Senator, you & your colleagues have done nothing to reform immigration.
you are standing up for our basic freedoms. Thank you
All @GOP should be working hard to stop this man from another day in office.
Continue the fight #stopSessions and #stopDeVos
the same Sen. Graham who said Radical Islamic Terrorism is our biggest threat about 100 times on the campaign trail
Stay the course. Be courageous. Be on the right side of history.  Thank you.
the president is, without a doubt, the WORST president EVER.

The past 8 yrs you guys have let this erosion occur. At least Trump is trying.
thank you for fighting @realDonaldTrump! @SenToomey history won't forget your silence.
I remember your silence over the past 8 years!!!
Trump turns Syrians away at the airport and libs lose their mind. Obama leaves Cubans at the beach and *crickets*.
Thank you!

Well you're standing in the wrong place. We voted for Trump not them

@SenToomey - America needs you all to be the adults and end the insanity.  25th Amendment
AND not talk about WW3 unless we are about to go into WW3 (which I hope you prevent by impeaching this turd)
And thank you for standing for us.
Start process to IMPEACH HIM NOW! You have enough cause!
Are you delusional?
U cant impeach just bc ur feelings are hurt.
Has nothing to do with hurt feelings...one day you will wake up and know why!
I did a year into Obamas presidency.
In the furor over the #MuslimBan please also remember to do due diligence for all appointments
Lip service is inexcusable. What are your actions. Act NOW!
"Am I wrong? No! It's my constituents who are out of touch!" - Casey

THANK YOU !!
PROUD OF YOU !!
