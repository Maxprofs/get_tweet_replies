Good afternoon, @RepCharlieDent, @SenToomey, @SenBobCasey. This is you constituent, Daniel. He has something to say to you. Please watch. 
Thank you @SenBobCasey
Thank you, @senBobCasey.
Those PA GOP are cowards, add in @RepRyanCostello @RepMeehan with that group. They are such puppets, embarrassment to our Commonwealth!
I thought Costello came out with a statement questioning trump - not a huge fan, but was happy to see this
It was pathetically weak just like his no vote on Trumpcare, it was safe for him and the other SE PA reps to vote no.
Agreed...and agreed it sad to have to give praise to..hanging on to hope by a thread.
We need a special counsel to investigate Clinton emails, Obama's unmasking,& Lois Lerner.That's where you'll find the corruption & criminals
but can we trust McCabe??
There should be a special prosecutor for Hillary's known crimes. No evidence that Trump committed a crime.
45 is a liar,to continue to believe that he is not guilty  inpunes your lack of intelligence. Pitiful he will lead his,supporters to hell
Thank you Senator Casey. Now if @SenToomey would open his eyes and face the facts, maybe he would do what is right and necessary.
#nothinglessthannullifiedelection #doover
Thank you, Senator. You're the only one representing PA & we appreciate it.
Although his silent most times and I guess that's the best way to be the silent bullet,he does represent us here in PA
I believe it is time to shut down all Senate business until a special prosecutor is appointed to look into the actions of Trump
Can we get a special prosecutor for Hillary's crimes or does that only count for Republicans?
Exactly what did she do? She was exonerated unlike 45. He is going to be impeached & jailed.
Seriously, she had an email server in her BATHROOM. Do you have one there?She sent classified info over unsecured email servers.
As a fellow PA resident I concur!!! @SenToomey needs to stand up for his constituents like @SenBobCasey
Oh boy my silent Senator finally spoke
Thank you, Senator, for doing the work of both PA senators since @SenToomey can't be bothered.
Maybe Casey should hold Toomey's town meetings for him. @phillysnowflake @SenBobCasey @SenToomey
AGREED,TOOMEY is scared to face his duplicity
Thank you Senator Casey!!! If only @RepCharlieDent & @SenToomey had the same morals and conscience.
Senator more needs to be done to for the Deputy AG AND GOP Leadership to support this.  If not it will be business as usual.
Than you senator Casey for being a soldier for the people of Pa. And a patriot for our country.
Bob, Hold tight to your #BLUESLIP
No Mercy. We support you.
#resist at every turn
How you Democrats can continue to spread lies is beyond me. You convict people before you actually find the proof. Keep stirring up people.
We are spreading facts. 45 is lying. From the beginning til he is arrested kicking & screaming. #TheResistanceLives
Agreed,it's so SAD when 45's supporters. Blindly, follow someone who consistently lies,and that is A PROVEN FACT!!!!
I disagree. You need to support all of America, not just your constituents that seem to be out of touch.
Start the ball rolling with the rest of the Senators.
Wow!  There are a lot of birthers out here today.
How about on HRC?
As soon as any crime is revealed. Since there are 3 investigations & 7 other committee's doing the same thing, is this prudent financially ?
In 10 mths. NO collusion has been revealed & it's ridiculous to spend even more money when competent agencies are doing the job now.
Thank you @SenBobCasey
Thank you Senator Casey for standing up to this circus of a president.
@Alyssa_Milano @SenBobCasey has been on our side from the beginning. He has stood up against the insanity represented by his co-senator
Aetna is pulling out of ALL Obamacare exchanges by 2018.  Premiums & deaths will skyrocket.  Comments Senator Casey?? @PAGOP @SenToomey
This is so incredibly lame.  You Libtards are just too much.
A must share; must do. Everyone has a phone with video & audio recording feature, so should not be that difficult. #StandWithDan
The countdown is on!! Rick Saccone 2018
Are you ready to support a special prosecutor @SenToomey? Time to show if you believe country TRUMPS party.
Thank you @SenBobCasey. We know you are disgusted. Now talk to Toomey. We need you in this horrible time.
Thank you for all your help protecting America and the Constitution. We are with you!
With only a handful of fed up @SenateGOP , you can help grind the Trump agenda to a halt until the #RussianInvestigation issue is resolved!
When its resolved, then things will once again be open for negotiation.
He sits so squarely in the demographic you guys say you want to attract he couldn't be a better fit. Smack dab in the middle of America
US AG may need to step down for obstruction.
First recuses himself due to Russian connections, then suggests lead investigator be fired.
@Alyssa_Milano Lets also get a special counsel for @HillaryClinton's emails while we are it, DAP will not approve a special counsel.
About a gzillion times.
Perhaps you'll have more sway with @SenToomey than mere Penn residents? Repeat calls asking for rationale for not supporting SpCo. No answer
THE Bob Casey is asking for an investigation? Oh my God this is getting real serious.
Thank you Senator.
@Alyssa_Milano  @SenToomey And you Toomey????  Constituents are listening to the crickets so far.
I think Merrick Garland might be available since he doesn't have SC duties to worry about..
Thank u @SenBobCasey at least some1 is representing us in PA.
Halleujah
Thank you Senator.  You are our only Senator actually representing us in PA.
I'm a constituent as well @SenBobCasey , @SenToomey , and @RepScottPerry and I as Greek with Daniel.
That bat-crap crazy broad has no reason to be involved in the state of Pennsylvania politics. She does not live here do not cater to her
@Alyssa_Milano @RepCharlieDent @SenToomey thank you senator.please save our great country
I"m going to congress soon to testify. President Obama order investigation why some people used my identity to meet him in the WhiteHouse.
Thank you @SenBobCasey we're counting on you
Dent thinks so as well.  Toomey has been as quiet as a whore in church.
@SenToomey is a snake! It's disgusting we are stuck with him for another Senate term.
Name 1 Russian Trump collided with? There are none. MSM is the enemy of this country & are Unamerican. You & Dent need to go
Thanks for all you do for Pennsylvania.  I live in Texas but I am from the Scranton area.
My Zip code is 18011; agree 100% with chinstrap kid.
McCabe said one is not needed haha
Doesn't matter, we're pushing for one, we'll get it too, #ResistanceIsStrong millions now want their heads to roll!
Hahahaha so funny
Thank you Senator Casey for responding and calling for special counsel.
From Phila - I agree Dan- If Trump's team has done nothing wrong this will exonerate. If they have been in cahoots, we need to know asap
Pat Toomey is a craven stooge. You may as well spit into the wind. The lot of the GOP is bought and paid for. Senator Casey I respect you.
Top senatoring!
Hey there @SenToomey! This is what engaging with your constituents looks like.
Oh hell, @SenToomey is back in hiding? Did anyone check under his desk?
our senator....PA proud!
