It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!
your a disgrace. Let trump have his cabinet and start doing the people's business. The democrats lost get over it
Senate's right to advise and consent. Shouldn't let crooked, unqualified donors by w/out questions
he passed . Democrats Are wasting everyone's time
No, they are really not. See Flynn, Michael for what happens if these people don't need to be vetted...
you can't be more vetted than a 3 star general
Who was negotiating with Russia while Obama was still president.
and vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. Just what you want in an NSA head.
who let Russia run over the Ukraine and bomb innocent Syrians. Flynn isn't going anywhere he didn't break any laws
@CloudContact #45s whole administration is a disgrace.
This cabinet is as big of an embarrassment as Trumps foreign affairs!
The disgrace is the "herd mentality" that has elected representatives vote for unqualified individuals. The disgrace is the GOP
the real disgrace is @POTUS
oh, and @PatToomey another disgraceful, corrupt, coward.
Everyone should read from Coretta Scott King letter. Make @SenateMajLdr silence all of you!
Yes, this is a disgrace. 
@POTUS Resisting based on principle (conflict of interest of your nominees) is not obstruction

He's not draining the swamp, he's restocking it!
@realDonaldTrump Because you have picked horrible candidates who have no clue.
FRAUD is fraud, and LIES are the arrows of mendacious misogynistic xenophobes, H8 mongers, and White Supremacists
The power crazed Republicans are destroying our Democracy. We cannot let them continue to follow this dangerous path.
Americans want Casey schumer Pelosi Warren self serving obstructionist stop running their own agenda we c you. OUR government
the people of PA thank you for opposing the #swampcabinet.
Cooperate, Senator. We need confirmations 2 go thru. Quit stalling.
@Vote_Hillary_16 @realDonaldTrump This is not a Cabinet. It is a group of oportunists looking to feather their own nest.
@MdlfMockingjay really, Swamp Cabinet? You want to throw stones.  Remember, Bob, I control your schools now. #NotF'ingAround
@quizquest where are the checks and balances?
#SwampCabinet  @POTUS c'mon Democrats keep em holding as long as you can
bob bob bob , ya just can't win
Says the swamp.  PA voted for Trump.  Can't wait for your seat!!
@realDonaldTrump #DonaldTrump get in your bathrob, take your hair pills, and read up on the word hypocrisy.
@JJohnson2u
That's tough talk for a guy looking at an election in a Red State in 2018... you starting to get scared about being primaried?
stay fierce senator! Resist!
get off twitter and do some real work...I'm watching
Thank you for your passion and leadership in standing up for Pennsylvanians against these horrible Cabinet picks.
Even Gold Bond can't fix this!
I understand you will need to get as much lobbyist money you can get. You won't be re-elected
thank you for holding them accountable.
Indeed they do.  All those Russian ties too.
You're a Democrat, the antithesis of pay to play and graft. What have you done for the people of Pennsylvania??
go back to sleep Bob!!
The way you and others will oppose anything @realDonaldTrump says or does is the real disgrace.
seriously senator. Thank you.
he has yet to acknowledge New Orleans tornado YUGE problem bigly
Thank you Senator Casey for facing down this bully
Philly & Pitt will not save you this time,there are no coattails for you again,2018 will bring 2 GOP senators from PA,super maj
@realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't remember that Republicans SHUT DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  Test Trump for Alzheimer's Disease.
thank you once again for speaking up for us. I have never voted in anything but presidential elections but that will change now
How quickly they forget about the 8 years of obstruction of Obama.
Thank you Bob Casey
DISGRACE IS ON @GOP and #TrumpDestruction
Thank you for ALL of your hard work and being a voice for the people of PA! Your a far better Senator then the other one!
The disgrace is the #schumernistas are acting like a mob of petulant children, instead of U.S. Senators. Grow up!
You know this is not normal. Keep fighting. Never give in,never surrender
Thank you for fighting for America, and American values, Senator!
and poor choices
thank you so much for speaking out! Please stay strong in this crazy time.
Can you convince any GOP Senators to abstain from voting - Sessions?  (That way they won't have to vote "NO" - just abstain)
Stay strong Senator Casey. These nominees are awful & the  Republican Senators are seamless. RESIST
That's the real threat, and Trump doesn't seem to understand that. Can you please impeach Trump before he takes your jobs? @senbobcasey
The R's obstructed their way into a SC pick that should have been Obama's!
His nominees didnt have their shit together! Half of them hadn't done their paperwork for vetting. Nobody's fault but theirs
I live in PA and I agree with you 100%. I have many reservations about Cabinet nominees.
@rappahannockmag everything about this administration is utterly disgraceful starting with @realDonaldTrump #nationaldisgrace
You, sir, are my hero!  Keep up the great work Senator!
this "so called President " tweets like a petulant 12 year old.
Bob, you are clearly hiding something....what is it that you are so affraid of...we'll get to the bottom of it....soon....soon
The picking of unqualified people to these positions and tearing up the constitution is a disgrace! Checks and Balances!!

they are traitors to the US
you are a savage bro
at the risk of giving away my age; Right on Senator!
#SwampCabinet - I like.

It is at the point that the qualification is only money. People be damned.
@realDonaldTrump What a pile of bull considering PBO didn't get to choose a legit SCOTUS - Karma has claws, Turnip. Not sad4u.

Thank you for your vote today
he's basically calling our democratic process a disgrace..

isn't there a law against them having so many conflicts of interest?? Or is that something else the republicans destroyed?
They just ignore it anymore. Lobbyists need to get the boot
Thank you for fighting for us! We are behind you, 100%!
Obstruction by the People!  Democrats are just riding our coat-tails!
