the Dems aren't afraid of DeVos as Ed secretary because they fear she will fail.They shudder at the prospect she will succeed.
She doesnt know what IDEA is--c'mon, put country before Party and give our kids a chance
@fatimamuhammad @BetsyDeVos 
So to help herself, she should step down.
I have 21 more years of experience than DeVos, yet smart enough to know I'm unqualified for #SOE
I couldn't agree more @SenBobCasey that @BetsyDeVos  is unqualified and I fully support a No vote!
Do not confirm this woman! Public schools are the foundation of we build our future upon!
too bad all her donations just paid off
Sen. Casey.  Let's privatize education!!!  Get the government out of education!!!!!!
@mjn101506 You'll probably talk to @SenToomey before I do, could you tell him to No on Devos? Signed: His Constituency.
if you could also tell him to clear his voicemail, that would be great.
Exactly. @SenToomey its ez 2 add space 2 vm. Constituents might get impression u r deaf to r concerns > #noDeVos
Just called again abt #noDevos, Voice mail still full. Why? Staff shld add more storage. Calls will keep coming, easy to fix. :(
Ms DeVos should be rejected
what experience did you have as a Senator?governor's son, pathetic,we got stuck by stupid voter's name recognition
Amen! Our kids in wonderful public school system in MontCo--top rated schools. Pub school DESERVES better! #noDeVos
thank you for voting NO
So, your solution is just to through a temper tantrum and not do your job?  Nice.
I agree. Please get your fellow Senators to NOT for her!!!
Thank U Senator 4 Your Impassioned speech today!
can you share your thoughts with @SenToomey? He's got some #alternativefacts about her
could you please tell your colleague sen toomey that? he's not listening to constituents
Washington is moving in a direction that does not sound like democracy. What is Congress doing to try to stop the madness?
Thank you for pledging to vote no on DeVos. PA and America need a public school friendly Secretary.
so why did 12 committee members vote for her?
Thank you @SenBobCasey #pa
Obama Admin has throw 7 Billion at Public Ed and the study shows no positive results. Time for Change>
thank you for trying, but I will not stop to stop her from hurting our childrens public ed @BetsyDeVos
spoken like a student of private education. And your kids. Hypocrite.
and creationism. Creationism!
Call out your Repub colleagues for preventing calls to their offices - Busy, no message lines, etc! HIDING!
And she's a plagiarist.
@RELenski @BetsyDeVos how will her proposals be funded. Will they be added to state obligations where education is under fire?
She doesn't even know the diff. between growth and proficiency. As a teach. that is appalling.
SAY HELL NO
She has NO qualifications. She is completely unqualified
thank you Senator for your vote for the children of our Nation!
@americansunited @BetsyDeVos All in the name of securing public funding for religious education.
I agree! Please do not vote for her at her confirmation! MI schools have tanked in the last 10 years!
@SenAlexander and @SenBobCorker will not answer. They are voting yes. As a mother and TN voter, I'm deeply disappointed.
True! Charter schools that don't teach science &  have bibles instead of books. Arts is a vcr & "christian" video
2 but with Apraxia of speech. He is talking and reading and is a great well rounded child. He's 7. No to DeVos.
@Jahmai11 @BetsyDeVos Plagiarized someone's work in confirmation questionnaire @kylegriffin1
my Grandson had CHIP, Early Intervention and Special Ed Therapy and tools needed in NPSD. He was born perfect but 1
@Alt_DeptofED "Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal, too." -Steve Bannon, 2013.
@Alt_DeptofED  Thank you. No to Sessions too. Then act to save our republic from fascism.
YES SIR.  NO TO DEVOS
@ActualEPAFacts @BetsyDeVos We know. Now cozy up to some GOP & get them to see the light please! Signed- a mother of 2
and remind me again where America ranks in education?!
@SenToomey Bravo Sen.Casey! I only hope Toomey has some sense & votes against Devos!#PAAgainstDevos!
@ActualEPAFacts @BetsyDeVos vote No and No to Pruitt out environment depends on it and you!!!
@realDonaldTrump has no experience in ANYTHING and the work he has done is centered upon efforts to destroy our Constitution.
Alternative universe: she knows all the weaknesses of ed. and turns out to be a great ed. secretary
WHAT EXPERIENCE DID YOU HAVE, MR SENATOR, TO BE A SENATOR. GO'S BOTH WAY SIR.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for standing up to @BetsyDeVos—please do the same for @jeffsessions & Trump's stolen #SCOTUSnominee
NO to Sessions also, please Senator Casey
we need school choice our public schools are not doing their job to educate our children
No experience=Trump: no problem

Tons  of $$$$= Trump: Give her the job
@ActualEPAFacts @BetsyDeVos But the most important lesson we can give children is how to plagiarize! http://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/devos-questionnaire-appears-to-include-passages-from-uncited-sources/2017/01/31/50577dec-e7be-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html …

Your colleague @SenToomey is well out of order. We need you to apply pressure and influence.
We need to do something different. Please vote "yes".  PA voter
No seriously this is not her intention. But, why would this be bad?
thank you!!!
yes! You are a patriot. Have Vannon and Trump skated close enough to treason yet?
Pls #Reject @BetsyDeVos
Thank you for standing up for our kids!
She is part & parcel of a coup, Senator. House staffers worked on an NDA basis to help Trump w/EO on ban. DeVos a distraction.
we prefer free market solutions to inefficient education paradigm. It deepens racial inequality in education, but#capitalism
so put a hold on her nomination
so you're voting against her, right?
Well Bob????
Yes, please vote NO!
Don't throw the baby out with the bath water
Like this? "Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal, too." -Steve Bannon, 2013.
but this is the job you signed up for.
I get its difficult to sell out Scranton's seniors by blocking cheap safe meds for your pharma buddies with us bugging you.
please vote no!
didnt get through once, and voicemail is full and hanst been emptied in two days.
Unfit for the job, in many, many ways!
Ive called 20 times since the busy signals started, suggesting ANYONE was even bothering to pick up phones.
please stand strong and vote not on Devos. #resist
Make sure @SenToomey knows this. Make sure he votes no. We can't have either pa senator voting against public education.
Ha! (@SenToomey) doesn't care about anything but profits.
yeh she sucks
tell em Bob
how you feel about Senator Sessions?
