and she should be silenced!
what I find most loathsome..FOUR MALE colleagues read THE SAME LETTER and NO Republican made a peep. #sexism
And so will we. #ShePersisted #SoWillWe
Let her speak she is right he is a racist
Warned about what. @SenSanders was allowed to read the letter without opposition. Suppression of anyone who isn't a white man?
POS traitor deserves a good hanging!
Sounds like a Senator of worth. The "party" is lessened by this action.
Thank you for all your hard work. #PAProud #ShePersists
WHAT was she warned about?  And WHY??  WHY are you silencing those who represent us?!  YOU sir, should be ashamed of yourself!
Aren't you vetting Jeff Sessions for atorney general? We don't need a biased atorney general!
@ChuckNellis Rules are rules. Subject the Dems don't understand.
Do you really think it is proper to just throw out the rules because you "want to"? If so, you should resign!
I am proud of Mitch ! Warren needs to shut her mouth. Mouthy woman 
She deserves all of the condemnation we can heap on her...Disgusting human being!
Why aren't you interested in what she had to say??? We already know @JeffSessionsrbx is racist, & you support him #ResistTrump
he is supporting Sen Warren
Thnx for schooling me on that! #SwingLeft
Hope citizens drop Liz. She fails at caring for her voters only using her office for poltical gain.
@crazylary51 https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259988-Scott-King-1986-Letter-and-Testimony-Signed.html#document/p1 â€¦
Lawlessness, rudeness, corruption, disrespect for others, Anti-American, slavery, hatefulness, bigotry, dishonest is liberals
W
What if you each read two sentences from the letter?
Let her speak? Why?  When was the last time Fauxcahontas had anything of value to say?
Sounds like a rallying cry to me.
@crazylary51 she was quoting texts already entered into the senatorial record on Jefferson Beauregard Sessions not impuning him
@SenWarren #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Apparently making America great is women knowing their role again... Silenced
intelligence is often only silenced by a muzzle.
@crazylary51 you should never nominate a Senator if members cannot question his character as a known racist
Coretta Scott King
For a second, my heart was crushed, thinking these were your own words. Whew!!! 

Fight the good fight - for ALL Americans!
The evil MM you have done to USA? vengeance is God's! with our eyes we will see the reward of wicked!
the only way to silence intelligence is to muzzle it.
senate Repubs are a disgrace. Rule of law?  Don't think so anymore!
To the 50 who had the spine to do it. BRAVO! MORE! Long have WE waited to see the laws & rules enforced against the lawless. US
Everyone, the words in quotes are NOT Senator Casey's. He supports Sen Warren's right to speak, & is a champion of the people.
Republicans are all RACIST LIKE TRUMP THEIR FAILED LEADER
What's happening to the U.S. Senate?? #LetLizSpeak
@MonsterMarcia @SenBobCasey The GOP members now feeling free to let their flag fly.
@crazylary51 you just joined the ranks of the idiots in my book for defending McConnell's power play
OMG,He's nominated for AG!
I want those words on my tombstone.
You people are despicable and should all be Fired! You are supposed to be elected reps. of all of us. You are just puppets!
We're going to need better than that.
@SenWarren fight fiercely Senator. You were elected by your state to represent them and democracy is in danger if prevented
This action is appalling and very frightening #letlizspeak
@bflysmile Pls find ways to read the entire letter. Repeat. #resist
So because she was warned not to read a letter that opened up a discussion she was censored, that is why the country is upset.
What is happening to our country??
America cannot stand without obeying & respecting the laws of this land. The law can be changed, but until then respect it
We will vote your ass out asap, indeed!
based on her views and past things she has said and done, it was no surprise to me
What you did was simply Un-American and goes against the very foundation of a democratic government
thank you for continuing to represent us and for defending the Republic #letlizspeak @SenWarren keep fighting for what is right
Republicans have lost their collective brains.
She alrdy knew she was in Viol.of a Rule sheSWORE2obey&YT tried2Viol.anyway. NO Special treatment.
She should line up in an orderly manner for the gas chamber or pay for the bullet, too, right? We wouldn't want RULE breaking..
Basically, sit down  shut up and go make me a sammich. Old white men in their glory now with the orange nazi
@badov49 Her obstruction of the nomination was attempt to silence We the People, guess fair is fair
@SenateMajLdr has been obstructing our government since 2008.
what ever happened to free speech?
Your daily reminder that you're in the minority and Pocahontas is helping to keep you there.
Why must she be silenced if she had something of importance to say? You sound scared of what she's got to say!
Problem is she has to SHOUT everything she says like a 2 year old! I don't even know what her indoor voice SOUNDS LIKE!
If the info in that letter is so bad that it can't be read on Sen floor then it's bad enough that America needs to hear it.

That's bc she has to continuously speak out against bigots like you. Not her fault that you don't listen to valid logic by CSK
it is her Constitutional right and duty to speak! You should be ashamed!  She speaks for the majority of US!
@RosalesRosina we can safely call it - Tuesday February 7th 2017, 7:32pm, democracy on the senate floor died...

Good talk.
Mansplaining the rules which apparently aren't consistently applied.
Must be awful to be there watching this. Thanks for showing up for D-PA. #LetLizSpeak
So she was warned that her rights were about to be violatd.Great.Worse things said about dems #letlizspeak #fascistdictatorship
@NoFascistsPls  As well as she should as this man was HORRIBLE THEN AS WELL AS NOW! #letlizspeak @boyndog @MtnMD @DebraMessing
SHAME!
@SenToomey this is a disgrace...People, swing voters, thought they were making an educated choice when voting 4 u over McGinty
Really? enjoy your power now , a tidal wave is coming
clearly you're threatened by facts and truth.
Technicality. Nominee happens to be a Senator. So Rule 19 prevents criticism of nominee during debate.
that was outrageous and misuse of the rule. A total affront to women, minorities and the truth.
.@SenBobCasey CORETTA Scott King was an eye witness to history.  #LetLizTalk
that could be, but was it a slanted eye witness ?
and you chickenshits don't want us to hear the truth about racist Sessions - deplorable
Boo hoo libtards! Liberal tears everywhere!
shame on you
and we will not let this go unnoticed. Actions have consequences, @SenateGOP YOU are on notice.
Let the GOP bury themselves, save it for Trump impeachment speeches
They just don't want to hear reasons why they should vote no... though in their hearts they know they shouldn't.#stopsessions
you win at racism and sexism and supporting a tyrant! May you get primaried!
Ted Cruz called Mitch a liar, nothing happened to him
Thanks guys! Now MILLIONS will read what Senator Warren was going to read to just the 100 or so of you. #LetLizSpeak
your actions are disgusting! Let Liz speak!
ooh warned.
#cant19themall
good for her!
He just gave us the next battle cry. Thanks Mitch.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @SenSchumer Well Scranton Bob, as the big O used to say, elections have consequences.Liz crossed the line!
It's disgraceful. This riles me as much as the other crimes committed lately. It shows the disrespect for our values.
#HoldTheFloor Senator!  #NoToSessions!  #ProudDemocrat tonight!  Thank you Senator Casey #WheresPat?
She's above the rules, apparently. Shut her up!
We appreciate all of the long days AND NIGHTs you are putting in for us. We will remember how you have tried to help us! THANKS
First they try to shove nominees through, now they censor opposition to them? Doesn't sound like a democracy. #LetLizSpeak
#goodtrouble #letlizspeak ,#2020
You've created a hornet's nest.  We will not forget your trying to put women and blacks in their place.
@NancyDStreet @SenateMajLdr knows no bounds for his partisanship.  Old Kentucky cracker!  What good have you done old man!
no good that's what!  Don't vote for him next election !!!
ripped right out of the stop @HillaryClinton playbook. #letLizSpeak
Because she's a badass! #LetLizSpeak
Can we as citizens call for censure of a Senator? GOP didn't toe the line they long jumped over it. Sick of GOP ignoring us.
She is nuts.  Shd needs s steady dose of lithium.
A letter from Coretta Scott King is not fitting for the Senate floor? That's your argument?  #LetLizSpeak
@PrincessBravato @SenBobCasey I feel sure good old Strom didn't oppose him either.
RESIST
LET HER TALK!  It's important. The warning was a BS excuse to stifle Ms Kings remarks being heard.
read the letter!!!! Make them shut you all up
Please read the letter. Speak up for us!
what in God's name is going on there???
In history despite being warned we pushed forward to persist when the cause was just...thus we are now Americans.
@SenMajLdr  #elizabethwarrenismyhero
...keep tweeting, Senator...love it.
Read the Letter, Sen. Casey! Make them vote against every single one of you.
the letter should be read. Sessions, like EVERY OTHER person nominated by our so called president is unqualified
#resist 
This is going to be my new motto to live by.
I am scared of what is happening. All of it. It's too much. Too fast,
