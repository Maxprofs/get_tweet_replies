You're Democrats only hope. Don't be voting yes 2 anything Republican. Remember how they did obama?
#LockThemUp #LockHimUp
you also lie about your money
we are counting on you. What ever happen to Trump's butler?
@torileehanson @SenBobCasey did I miss something, when are purgery trials for all these noms who've clearly purgered themselves?
It only takes ONE SENATOR to put on hold on Mnuchin's confirmation vote.  I urge you to do so.
and your ass lied about the 1.4 million loan extended to you by bank of America you never disclosed!
The gall of failed IndyMac CEO mikeperry62 (cost taxpayers $4B+) to praise RWNJs Marine Le Pen, Michael Bolton, Dinesh D'Souza 
vote NO for Trump's nominees
Did Liz vote for Carson?
You're the only liar here.
That should be an immediate disqualification. Why is this not a law?
Did anyone involved go to prison?
@ddayen @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts - Is there at least one person connected w/this administration that doesn't lie?
The campaign is Over! 
Please let's work together!
It takes A PROVEN LIAR, to know one!!! RESIGN. Become a DOG CATCHER.
Let's call him Munchkin :)
Sen.Warren,dear Liz, I agree w/U on NO DeVos, NO MUNCHKIN. But U MUST CONFIRM Sen. SESSIONS.U must
it seems you can commit perjury with no consequences just ask Hillary Clinton.
@kimmie8264 @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts And you expected anything better from a #Trump nominee? This is why ALL must be supposed
Instead of pointing out the lies, try instead to find the truths.  IF you can #StandUpToTrump
all of Trumps picks are liars. The Republican party just passively approved them all.
The only thing constant about trumnp's presidency is the lies and ineptitude.
Warren (Fauxcahontis) is accusing someone of lying?? LOL
warren mislead people about DObb frank this law is a joke, Wells Fargo. To lazy to enforcelawsinstea
I guess Senator Warren should no a lie when she sees one.Warren your a hypocrite. No vote for you.
Block him if you can!!!!
Then move to put his ass in jail.
block him please! Also not qualified was Ben Carson and you voted for him!
@RTMcFadyen @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts isn't lying to Congress kinda illegal???
LIAR

@ddayen @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts Just following the boss's example.
@joanmccarter @SenBobCasey @MarkWarner Mark, your office won't answer the phone.  Please follow @SenWarren
@ddayen @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts block this joker. Refuse to grant Unanimous Consent.
What are you prepared to do about it?
@ddayen @SenBobCasey So are you going to do your job and VOTE NO on his confirmation or roll over & sellout like Ben Carson vote?
Wasn't he under oath? Is there enough evidence to get him for perjury?
a lie is a lie....DO NOT CONFIRM!!!
thank you Senator Warren. Keep fighting.
@SenBookerOffice @SenatorMenendez vote no
the last thing we need is another liar to the administration
I guess it's similar to you lying about your 1.3 million dollar line of credit
@ford_cassie @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts wonder if Elizabeth Warren has disclosed her $1.3 Million Dollar credit line yet.
Thank you for looking out for all of us
But how, exactly, are you going to stop Mnuchin's nomination? #WeSeeYou
no offense, but if GOP is going to confirm, move on to something you can actually stop or change. We need you!
This falsehood under oath alone discredits his candidacy why vote on a man in cuffs?
WHERE R #Mnuchin's e-mails, correspondence From His Heinous Home Foreclosure Business???
Warren the corrupt political HACK didn't say that about Tim Gietner when he didn't pay his taxes. So hypocritical.
If truly caught lying, I cannot abide and am calling for his dismissal. This cannot be allowed.
i hope  you pace yourself because you have  8 years of  Trump  take a chill pill. and act ur age
You should know better than to fall for fake news but then again it is you so go figure
@charolyn_ @SenBobCasey  Say no to these nominees or dig deep, until they have all the right answers
You>@SenWarren #lied that #vaccines are safe. Back-up your #wordvomit & repeal NCVA give #parents right to sue. @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts
we live in a culture of prevaricating dribble, powerful, rich men who lie, under oath
why is trump handing us liars and people who are incompetent? This is the worse I've ever seen.
.@SenWarren Impeachment leaves complicit GOP: #RussiaGate + #VoterFraud = bipartisan call for immediate #NewElection & #50StateVoteAudit.
@DemFromCT @SenBobCasey @DispatchAlerts aren't there penalties for lying to Congress?
block all appointments.
You make millions in foreclosures Elizabeth why you complain?
@senrobportman should also vote no! #alternativefacts
Don't want lying secretary of treasury!!
Please act to block all nominees and policies and Impeach Trump! Stop this madness! #ImpeachTrump
are cabinet nominees sworn in before their hearings?    Can he be charged with perjury?
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Senator Warren...please continue to call out the lies and liars fr Trump administration.
Mnuchin needs to be blocked.
You need to oppose every single one of Trumps nominees. They are all crooked.
Do his lies constitute perjury? Can he be punished for falsifying sworn testimony?
why can't he be prosecuted for perjury?  Or is that option only available for athletes?
Isn't it a serious crime to lie to Congress?
Reject him please.
Elizabeth Warren lied about being Native American and made a huge profit. She's unfit to be Senator.
Seems like just last month this would have been an instant disqualification. That's because it WAS just last month.
please vote NO on all the remaining cabinet nominees. #resist
That's terrible. That's like backing someone who cheated their way into the election just because they're on your team.
Hoping you will be consistent and vote against and not bail based on private talk: like Carson vote
keep it up Elizabeth Warren. We need you!
All his admin picks are LIARS!  only ones I respect are Maddis & Kelly. Fight for the people Warren!
also pres Bannon is anarcho-capitalist. Wealthy congress will be fine. What about the rest of us?
Mnuchin, Sessions,Tillerson, and Davos are all Liars and everyone of them have a Ulterior MOTIVE
Can you pls not vote for any nomination? Your Ben Carson vote has really shook us who believed in u
Munch is a threat to our America society this guy hasn't a clue about real America .
i'm tired of hearing misled when the truth is they lied
Thank you for using the L word and saying lie instead of "misleading", "falsehood" etc
The pot calling the kettle black.
We are counting on you! My Senators from Oklahoma are treacherous liars and theives.
vote no! This administration has to be stopped!
Look who is calling somone else a liar! lol
fake news...
Mnuchin lied to the Senate? Does that make him more or less likely to be confirmed by Republicans?
Wasn't he also registered to vote in 2 states? #PseudoVoterFraud.
do not vote yes again!
why can't the media just say "lied" . The call trump "president" which is a euphemism for "traitor "
because they fear us, because we are taking our message to the people circumventing fakenews
Thank you, @SenWarren for standing up for TRUTH!!! Will @SenBobCasey vote No? @DispatchAlerts #SwampCabinet
U'll vote against the nomination, yea? With everything U know, won't U fight with everything U have?
Unfortunately, you have lost credibility with me when you voted for Ben Carson... #shameful
