In June, I wrote to @SenateMajLdr calling for public hearings & outlining ways to improve our health care system.
If @SenateGOP abandons repeal, cuts to Medicaid & tax giveaways for the wealthy...
...then there are common sense steps Congress can take to improve our health care system.
The Administration must stop undermining our health care system and work in a bipartisan way to improve it. https://www.casey.senate.gov/download/the-not-so-quiet-sabotage-of-your-health-care …
.@CommMiller has outlined what must be done to assure affordable health coverage for Pennsylvanians.

I joined @SenatorShaheen in her common-sense bill to improve access to affordable coverage. @SenateGOP objected. https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1462 …
I want to thank everyone from PA who has called, written, or visited my office- you are making a difference.
But let's be clear, this is far from over. We must continue to fight to protect the care of all Americans. Continue to make your voice heard
Novel idea for @SenateGOP. ACA had years of hearings and input and was based on Republican plan.
Are the Dems going to work with the reps?
6% of everyone's income Free Insurance forall eyes dental alt therapies, send it to CBO :)
Thought that's what your partisan bill was supposed to do?
SINGLE PAYER! Kick Wall St out of Health Care! Grow a pair, Sen, & stand up 2 Hillary &Health Insur Comp! GET WALL ST OUT OF HEALTH CARE!
Time to vote out both parties as they won't implement our agenda the voters spoke.  Repeal Obamacare and tax breaks now or be replaced
Absolutely correct!
Keep using your voice Senator

Time for Bipartisanship!  @SenateMajLdr Listen to @SenBobCasey and  @SenJohnMcCain when they call for same!
With growing bipartisan opposition to GOP health care bill, @SenateMajLdr should work in bipartisan way to make health care more affordable
All my friends in Philadelphia voted for Senator Casey my Hero!
you need to do this vis op-positional
Capping pharmaceutical prices is a good place to start. Obamacare gave them unlimited pricing power. Threatened to eliminate patents.
That what the trade off to get some of the GOP to support ACA, sad isn't it they want money for the rich to give something to the poor.
After you Democrats screwed it up
Medicare for all Senator! Medicare for all!
How about #medicare4all bob? U have a bad record for voting for affordable healthcare yourself.
I think that's a JOKE! What have Democrats done that's good for us lately? MORE affordable by Democrats! Another joke. So, you are 2 fr 1. 
oh, wait. There were NO Republicans invited to craft that horrible Obamacare bill.
just the way the Democrats had bipartisan support when passing Obamacare.  I remember all those Rep. suggestions.
Can they really just repeal ACA?
Senator Casey please lead this effort.
Sen. Casey I'm guilty of not calling to thank you. I'll fix that today. @SenToomey here's your chance to do what's right. Call him to. Fixit
Let me be clear.  I'm pissed off at at people in Washington who refuse to work together for the citizens.  Worse than children #gettowork
The @SenateMajLdr must be kicked out. McConnell only has self-interests for @GOP instead ofNation. He is a bully. @FLOTUS... anti-bullying?
First Repeal Obamacare
I so agree! But how to make that happen - it's seems impossible 
Yes... MEDICARE FOR ALL
.@SenToomey Casey also represents PA, but actually listens & cares about its constituents. Perhaps it's time for you to listen to him.
Your desire for single-payer HC is obvious. Of course, the wealthy like you& The Swamp will be able to afford A+ private HC. #crapHC
Hi Waldo!  Where u been?
Senator Bob have you written with Pat toomey's writing? He's as full of BS as POTUS is!
So glad Pennsylvanians have you to look out for them. @SenToomey is the worst.
I love that your in there with this mess & sorry. Its the reason I voted for u bec I knw u can handle this & poss bring the Maj Ldr around.
Medicare for all Bob. Americans want it.
He should. But then again they've been gloating that they had the solution for the last 7 years. And now it's dead. Sad. Bigly sad.
I support finding a bipartisan middle ground to fix ACA while ensuring the most people possible have insurance (not just access)
Good, they should vote full repel!
Universal coverage for life. Nothing less.
PA gets $200B over next 10 yrs. STOP scaring people. Your rhetoric hurts people!
#MedicareForAll would work best have CBO score it Ur at least Public Option @kai_newkirk
Like single payer that will save a lot of money?
Thank you Sen Casey. I hope a bipartisan committee will be formed to create meaningful legislation that cares for the American public.
And please let women have a say on direct health issues that affect us! #SaveACA #WomensHealth
Call it Republican Care & make it single payer. They can have the credit.
@GOP has proven they can not be trusted with ACA. Leave it alone or we all live a rehash of last 3 months.

He doesn't do bipartisan
PA is lucky to have you.
Thank you for fighting with & for us. Thank you to your staff for actually answering phones, taking tallies & being wonderful to talk to.
Thanks for your hard work! Now let's look to Germany, Switzerland and France and learn how they do it! I'd be honored to help!
Japan
I hope you are right but I think the GOP wants a Win more than a healthcare bill that works for everyone.
If the GOP platform believed in providing insurance for anyone, yes, but that's not their platform.They believe if u can afford it u get it
Thx @SenBobCasey for fighting for PA! I just donated $200 to u. I'll be personally working 2 dethrone @SenToomey = = @SenMajLdr  We #ACA
But Moran, Lee and the Randroid all oppose the bill for the wrong reasons. It's not cruel enough for them. You can't reach those monsters.
Or how about a UNIVERSAL way that every other industrialized nation already has? SINGLE PAYER.
#medicare4all #SinglePayer #HealthCareForAll
Remove health insurance profits and excessive drug company profits as you say just like the other nations.
Won't happen!  The Dems &  SOME Republicans want Govt. Takeover of HC!  What could possibly go wrong there?  
Brilliant. Also in areas where insurance companies have left? Offer them the Medicaid option.
have you seen the Lindsey Graham plan? Do you like it?
I've not studied it in depth yet so I can't say a lot about it. In my opinion whatever we do it's must to be bipartisan.
Insurance company bailouts.
Public option medicare for all.
Senator Collins put offer out to work the Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act. That's the path to follow
Amen.  It's time to work together. @GOP @realDonaldTrump The party of Lincoln needs to hear The House Divided Speech.
Thanks for your efforts on our behalf. Proud to have you as my senator.
Like asking a vampire to eat a garlic sandwich.
@SenBobCasey Thank you for the work you do to represent PA. (Also your staffers are delightful when I call. Thank them too.)
Great staffers i must agree
Thank you @SenBobCasey for your tireless efforts to protect our healthcare.
Exactly! What the hell is the problem with creating a bipartisan solution that works for all Americans? #AMJoy
It costs money.
