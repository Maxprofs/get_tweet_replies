Respectfully, Senator, "very concerned" does not necessarily mean "will vote 'no' for". Is it your intent to do so?
I voted no on Betsy DeVos in committee and I'll vote no on her final conformation.
@TuesdaysToomey @Dave_Cochran My kids and I thank you.
Wake up Communists and Progressive s.  Your days are ending for this corruption
.@SenBobCasey you actually talk to your constituents? That's not how it works out here in NE. We call them &they ignore us. @SenatorFischer
Remember come re-election the ones who put riches over true American values & threw USA under bus
Thank you for talking to Pennsylvanians. @SenToomey could learn a lot from you. We want a #TownHall!
Thank you, Bob. I'm concerned about the education of our population, too.
Wow! You mean that you answer your phones? Show Pat Toomey how that is done @SenToomey
I am a lifelong elementary school educator. "Concerned" doesn't even begin to describe my level of alarm.
@SenateDems please Sir, do not vote for her. There are many more qualified educators to choose from.
she is a politician
Please tell @SenToomey to do the same! I've called every office of his and haven't been able to leave a voicemail!
@SenateDems In Texas, I pay $3K local school tax/yr. What's this choice program, me pay others to come to my city? Me=0 kids
@SenateDems BETSY DEVOS MUST GO. NO EXPERIENCE. MY GOD. BE DECENT AND DO NOT JOIN CABINET
@SenateDems filibuster this!  She should not be in govt!
as a mother of a public school student AND a special education teacher, this woman is GROSSLY UNQUALIFIED!
thank you! And thanks for picking up the phones. As a constituent who calls, it means a lot right now.
she like u is a d-bag and you will not get in next term
What is happening with the Russian hack investigation? Why is it getting swept under the rug. We wont't forget Bob.
The only concern I have is that you will not vote for her confirmation. Stop with all the nit picky BS, & vote.
@SenateDems Thank you for voting no on Betsy Devos. Any chance you persuasive enough to change Senate Rs on others coming thru?
maybe fellow Senators Toomey, Grassley, and Scott should recuse themselves.
@SenateDems Yeah right, must be a teacher in a union.
robot man votes as he is told and in this case he finally got it right
thank you so much for talking to your constituents!  New Castle is happy your our senator.
Union's hands in you pants again, Bobbie?
talk to @SenToomey
cause the teachers union has them whipped into a frenzy.  And you too I'm guessing.
@TomWellborn DeVos is the least qualified candidate possible. Even worse, she would be an enemy to public school system...
More than concerned. Hope you are strongly considering voting NO. Need someone in that job who knows what they are DOING.
I'm shocked she got you on the phone.
Also thank you for your diligence and duty!
Can you let @SenToomey know he needs to clear his VM or actually pick up the phone? Seems he's purposely avoiding taking to ppl
....next election cycle...you are GONE...
I have been calling and have not been able to get through to Toomey for days - please urge him to vote no on DeVos and Pruitt.
Please do the right thing and vote No. #waynepa
Wish you were working as hard to improve schools as you are to block Trump's picks!
: tell your counterpart Toomey to open up his phones & stop blocking us - and vote NO on DeVos!
lolz like your kids goto public school. We know you got that Soros money fraudster
can you convince any of your colleagues to vote no?
Thank you for demonstrating leadership and answering the phones so the public can be heard.
She has listened to the union propaganda promoted by people like you.
thank you! If only @SenToomey was willing to listen to his constituents, too!
@SenateDems Bob, I'm only worried about your obstruction of our democratic process. Casey out in his next election!
please do not support Gorsuch, I am one of your constituents I am asking you to not cross the party stand with dems
Public schools serve the public. Charter Schools serve for profits. Public Servants Inform & Serve Everyone!
Thank you for your efforts! Betsy DeVos would be a disaster for public schools.
I am from York County have a child in public school and strongly urge you to vote in favor of Betsy DeVos.
Thank you for being a voice of reason in all of this. I'm so proud that you represent Pennsylvania!
..very concerned abt the Ed nominee & w/just cause. Please, veto her, & find more GOP to add to the two already voting no.
@SenateDems if I don't show up for work, the 3rd day must have Dr's excuse, the 4th day I'm fired! Tomorrow "YOU'RE FIRED"!!
Nothing against her as a person but shezz there is better out there. PhD in Ed admin would be a start! Experience another!
Education money should follow the child and Parents should have a choice where they send their children.
@SenateDems Get Trump out of office.
If Senators and the elite have the right to choose their child's school, so should the rest of us.
she's completely unqualified. Trumps pics are meant to disrupt their departments. Trump is a danger to America. IMPEACH
I support School Choice and I support Betsy DeVos.
we r all against common core a waste, idk about Betsy but I do know our public schools need change, where we r isn't working
Thank you for listening and being accessible
Thanks for listening to your constituents.
can you call @SenToomey?  maybe you can reach him. I know this constituent can not.
Thanks for working for us!
. @SenBobCasey what else can we do? My representatives don't answer calls or emails? I've emailed other reps outside my zone...
@senrobportman ! Answer your constituents!
there's the major diff btwn you & #Toomey ... You SPOKE to a constituent!
not in PA but thanking you anyway. It's gonna be a busy 4yrs for you all but we appreciate it! Thank you.
@make5calls If you are so concerned, then there is only one way to vote - NO. Just do the right thing.
Thank you for listening to us!!!! I wish @SenToomey would listen to his constituents-no answer /ignore #StopSessions #DeVosvote
slow down on these phone calls! You sound almost TOO excited--don't want to scare your constituents
I work in a public school. Betsy DeVos mentored in one.  That is like saying I could be a surgeon because I watch GREY'S.
She does not have the qualifications necessary.
@SenateDems Erie teachers are very concerned too. They do not want her.
You could learn a thing or two here @OrrinHatch @senatormikelee. It'd be awesome if you found time to speak to constituents.
whoever isn't concerned about Devos doesn't know much about education. Period.
Kudos to you speaking with constituents. Wish @SenToomey would do the same. Perhaps he can explain support for DeVos.
Thanks @SenBobCasey for all you do. Too bad @PatToomey won't listen to the people of PA.
Just spoke to a constituent from New Castle whose son attends public school. She, like me, is very concerned about Betsy DeVos. 
- the lady from New Castle should want change, school district has a rank of 6 out of 10. Nice low expectation.
Thank you, Senator! I live in Bethlehem and am very concerned as well!
Tell every Pub you see!
Thank you!  DeVos is BAD for education and BAD for children!  NO!!!
Thank you Bob Casey for doing all you can for PA kids. Keep up the good work!
Can you talk to @SenToomey? I hear he's going to vote yes to Betty Delos no matter what his constituents say  
thank you for being oneach of the few politicians with a spine. We need more of you while Bannon, I mean Trump, is POTUS
say NO to DeVos
.@SenBobCasey any advice on how people can get through to @SenToomey to ask him to vote no on Devos? (Or is it a lost cause?)
@SenateDems its all about money! You lost my 3 sons! Fix the problem
@SenateDems Me too. DeVos could truly ruin our public school system.
3 kids in public school--one is getting an education thanks to IDEA. Pls. vote no. She is unqualified.
go talk to your colleague TOOMEY!  GET HIM TO VOTE NO!!!!
Senator Casey; I have been trying to get through 2 Toomey's office to voice concerns... no luck. Any suggestions?
#standingunited #resist #NationalStrike #NOWARWITHIRAN#NEWVOTE
Good on you! Thank you!
@SenateDems Get over it. Public school is doing a disservice to many. Need more choice. One size does not fit all!
@SenateDems term limits please
Please vote NO. Please do it 4 kids who R relying upon U! Public Schools R NECESSARY in so many states! Get Betsy DeVos #out
Thanks. Now go across the hall & tell Toomey cause he's been absent.
i am very concerned too. Being rich is not a qualification.
@SenateDems vote NO!
@SenateDems I'm also concerned about the ease od Russian sanctions that trump said didn't happen . Very concerning
One more Republican to go against.  We can do it.  Call your Senators!
That's my hometown and I currently teach in a public school of similar socioeconomic standing. Thank you for opposing.
keep going, you have our support, FIGHT BACK DEMS on this  AND SCOTUS nom - worked for the Rs
Vote NO on Betsy DeWrong!
@SenateDems yes we must all stay alert as to what DV does!
You will do the honorable thing. Political suicide for those who vote yes. @SenToomey Should not be a partisan vote. #OurKids
@SenateDems thank you we fear for public education #noDevos
My daughter went to a Pennsylvania charter school and DeVos is unqualified
@SenateDems keep up the good work Senator Casey.  BTW have you seen Senator Tomey lately? Constituents report him MIA.
@SenateDems please find one more GOP Senator with sense.
Good, thank you for listening to us. Have you made a decision on #JeffSessions?
thank you... cAn you get toomey on the phone?
@MelissaFazli Thank you Sir!
Keep it up!
she wants all special ed , ESL and immigrants together with  white high achievers at her new schools
Thank you. Any chance you can influence @SenToomey? Been trying to get through to his office all morning. Busy line all day.
my colleague's friend in Congress suggested using his website to contact him, & I've faxed from my computer w zerofax
Get @SenToomey with the program!  #NotoDeVos
yes please!
We need to bolster public education not gut it! Thanks for standing against this nominee!
yes we do!
Thank you, senator. This is not a partisan issue. #DeVos is patently unqualified.
She must be a union teacher or someone getting paid by all the tax increases
 'for the children'
Thak you for your service.  Root issue is Trump, who is unfit.  How can impeachment begin?
Amen!
Thank you for actually speaking with your constituents! #VoteNoDeVos
im concerned about people who cant pay for their prescription drugs. Are you?
So go talk to Rep senators! Change someone’s mind. Please.
