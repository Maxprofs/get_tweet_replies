Speaker Ryan declines to call for congressional investigation into Gen. Flynn; says need to get more info before rushing to judgment.
Senator, as a resident of PA and a citizen of our nation, I demand accountability.
Stay on top of this for us Senator. We're behind you and appreciate all of your work.
This is unbelievable.  And these are the people who claim that we should care about an e-mail server.
@thekleptocracy @NBCNightlyNews @SpeakerRyan without a doubt this administration needs to have investigation!
Ryan is hiding something. It doesn't make sense that he's refusing to have an independent investigation. Why?
. As the Church Lady on SNL said Could that be Satan!!!!###
Isn't that the purpose of investigation?
@Can_ada everyone is over looking Brannon. He is on record as say he wants to bring down the government from the inside.
I ment Bannon
@tomcolicchio Easy, just check Gen. Flynns bank account and see how much he is being paid to not throw DJT under the bus.
@casanova_kara Look Trump, Spacer, Kelly Anne, etc don't know what the F**k their doing!!!!
Please hold their feet to the fire @SenBobCasey!
There's a way to "get more info" ... an independent investigation. https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/831528809669283841 â€¦
Put The Pedal to the Metal.Let the shit fly!!!##
@SpeakerRyan majority of Americans want an investigation.  No doubt, if this happened under HRC, we would have one #hypocrisy
@cmelchione @RepComstock  You can help defend our institutions. Please do right.
Rick Saccone 2018
Is this going to happen?? The America people have a right to know!!
democracy is going down fast nobody seems to want to fight against trump I don't get it party lines over country .greedy GOP
@NBCNightlyNews Keep fighting for us Sen. Casey.  This alliance w/Putin transcends political party, needs investigating.
even if you don't get an official investigation Dems should launch and fund their own investigation if GOP won't cooperate
Not expecting alot from chicken shit Ryan.Once you shit in your mess kit you're done.Astalavista Baby!!!:##
We need to remind the GOP that we will hang them with their own inaction. A failure to act = no love of country. Period.
Let's do this.
@tomcolicchio this time #WeThePeople demand an independent investigation . We deserve the truth and not 4 yrs from now
@tomcolicchio isn't that what an investigation does?
@tomcolicchio GOP spent $30m in tax $'s investigating emails & Benghazi. Must be tired of asking Q's w/ answers they don't like
@tomcolicchio @SpeakerRyan you're a coward Ryan. Plain & simple.
@tomcolicchio @NBCNightlyNews get rid of Paul Ryan he has sold out our country's national security & his integrity
I'm proud you are from Scranton. The last month you have showed character that not only defines democrats but also Americans.
Didn't need more info about Hillary/Obama deal to hand over uranium rights to Putin.
what a brainiac,how about investigating why obamacare killed middle-class with cost increases and high deductibles
did we get one in Hillary Clinton? Nope
Ryan is a coward. Enjoy the next two years. After that you're back to minority. Pissed off 2 many who vote.
@PaulBegala @NBCNightlyNews Is Ryan serious? When is the GOP going to stand up to this pseudo president. Dossiers on everyone?
@SpeakerRyan An INVESTIGATION is the way to get the INFO! Isn't that the GOP excuse for all those Benghazi hearings?
@SpeakerRyan doesn't want to give up his plausible deniability
So how do you get an independent investigation? Do citizens have to take to the streets yet again?
Yes! Keep fighting for the truth!
please please please get this done!!! This is so important
@LiberalJaxx #Trump4Treason #CORRUPTION #GTFOofOurHouse
demand answers! Hold them accountable!
please get the truth
@NBCNightlyNews  how much  "info" would Speaker Ryan need, perhaps when the phones in D C say press 1 for Russian 2 for English
let it go Bob.  Politics- ugh
@Sixstring787 Right. But bringing baseless charges against HRC 33 TIMES - totally justifiable. Fucking hypocrites. #impeachnow
isn't a large part of an investigation gathering information?
he's had nearly a year! If not more. This goes beyond Flynn. Rt up to when Trump called for Russia to hack HRC.
isn't that what an investigation is?
@NBCNightlyNews Like most, he is a corporate pawn, not capable of his own actions
let's hope the army does its investigation.
Ryan needs to do his job..if this was a Democratic issue. he would be ALL over it..all I ever see on tv is him kissing 45's ass
@PaulBegala   You get more information by investigating
Paul Ryan is a fool. Don't buy his shell game Senator. You're smarter than that.
Would you please tell @SpeakerRyan that an investigation would get the info he's looking for. Is he stupid?
Trump is now implicated by being told weeks ago by AG.  Flynn needs to testify now.
get them
Please keep this front and center.  This is key.  Their denial makes them complicit.
what does it take to get one started???
keep going after this! You have to push hard to the bottom of this. There you will find impeachment!
Isn't that what an investigation does? Does he realize that not everyone is as dumb as trump supporters?
@RealMTrombley ryan doesn't want more info. He has the info and isn't doing anything!
Not True,He's sitting on his Ass right now Twiddling his Thumbs and Scratching his Head.Power to People
Demand it on behalf of your constituents!  This is important!  Keep going!  Thank you!
Thank you. Our democracy thanks you. Keep fighting back HARD against truth decay.
@SenateMajLdr @PressSec @SenOrrinHatch @SpeakerRyan @CNN Calling 4 complete investigations of ALL @GOP The "Party of Criminals"
Doesn't judgement mean guilty/not guilty? Isn't investigation a fancy word for looking for info?
Keep pushing & don't stop pushing, Senator Casey! You have our full support.
What do we, the people, need to do to make this investigation happen?
You are making my Valentine's Day! Thank you!
@PaulBegala If you can't investigate the National Security Advisor breaking federal law to collude with Russia, then what ?
dont you investigate to get more information?
The people just wish the Dems would stop fighting the people. You are doing this to us.@senbobcasey
I guess you have to explain it like they are 5 years old, which they are not.  Just keep laying it out for them, Senator. 
Ryan is stalling. Why? What does he have to hide? Or who is he giving time to destroy evidence?
@RepRyan Unfortunately #Ryan is devoid of courage along with his fellow comrades in GOP congress so don't wait on him
Susan Rice lied about the deaths of 4 Americans..  Democrats never questioned it. Hypocrites
@NBCNightlyNews
, we will be holding you accountable Election Day.  We elected President Trump and you are trying to trip him on purpose.
Senator Ryan has lost his soul to Trump. It is shocking.
Sir- take the Train over & get in his face- Come on Sir- we are counting on you!  #GoldStarDad
DEFINE INDEPENDENT!
There is just one vitally important question: What does FBI Director Comey know? Flynn/Trump the real and imminent threat!
Do whatever it takes, Bob. PA is counting on you. Go big or go home - no compromise.
by all means; please do so then!
insider trading!
pander to Philly,  Western pa is extremely vetting you sir
why didn't you ever want an investigation on the lynch/Clinton airplane runway talk ? Hillarys server ? Pizza gate ?
@NBCNightlyNews YES! And foregoing this option shows that @SpeakerRyan shows, at least, poor leadership.
Keep fighting, Senator.  Interesting how @SenToomey is absent from everything.
Ask yourself. If the parties were reversed, what would the Republicans be doing right now? Setting up a special prosecutor.
@ Funny how Carma can come back to haunt your Ass.I remember General Flynn saying lock her up at Trumpdy Dumpty Rally!!##
GOP didn't seem to mind numerous investigations b4. It cldnt b bcs they wanted to besmirch #Clinton? The GOP is against us.
let's investigate where the leas came from and the IT Muslim brothers that took Democrats leaders computer data
you and the world now know that @SpeakerRyan is an immoral, corrupt liar.  Is he part of the Trump/Russia conspiracy?
Time to call the republicans in Congress AGAIN!!!!
Keep hammering these traitors Senator Casey. The majority IS behind you 
no way you can trust these slimy republicons
