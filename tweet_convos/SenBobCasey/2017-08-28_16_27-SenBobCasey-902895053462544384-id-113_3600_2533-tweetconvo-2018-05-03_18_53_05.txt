Nice, but they don't have computer access.
It only took a day for my 80 year old, legally blind, AF vet,  Ingleside resident father to get his FEMA REJECTION notification!  #HELP!
My application has been in pending status for 3 days. Out of work has really made this hotel difficult to afford
Nice thought except most people affected by #Harvey probably  lost their electronics in flooding. Phones may crash. #gotsocialworkers
Except videos and tweets are coming from the flood victims so they didn't crash and social workers are busy bodies that destroy lives
Many people without electricity &/or don't have electronic devices w/ them if they evacuated in a hurry. Would help if they listed a phone #
Speaking as someone who's been through many hurricanes, If power is out & cell towers are out, the only thing still working may be landlines
This is on u too. You fuked your own state. put ur own citizens in harm's way.
Here comes the fraudulent claims from Detroit Michigan
I hope FEMA helps them better than they did us during Ivan.
Most will be denied!  Ask people who have tried but received nothing!  FEMA the debris picker upper people!!  (Roads only)
FEMA:  Sunday I had a problem w DirectExpress. Today (12/11/2017 Monday) a DirectExpress Employee promised me that he would make sure that Direct Express will bill DSLExtreme $22.83 early Janurary 2018, thank you very much.
FEMA-u & trump aim to reduce it! Now u need it. paid by oil/chemistry made Harvey worse. Unlike Seagrove. WE have to pay for ur stupidity
Many #DREAMers are being affected by #Harvey and I believe TX Governor should follow TN AG on #DACA and show them some compassion.
Always knew those Death Camps would come in handy for something??!!! 
Mr governor we are very proud you. Pride of Texas
FEMA APP? We all know HEB has been doing a better and faster job getting us back on our feet. Get me an HEB APP? FEMA late yet again
How about sending affected people some free phones
Thank you Mr Vice President Pence for sharing this information with us. It's a welcome help. Thank you.
I just want to know if there any vacancy available
Yeah. Too bad applying doesn't mean you get anything... especially if you are a woman, LGBTQ, POC, Veteran, disabled, elderly or low income.
You must not allow #Harvey to break the bank...  Oh wait its white people in need
Video: “Katrina breaks my heart...but we must not let Katrina break the bank for our children & grandchildren” Mike Pence-2005 #ImpeachTrump 

Hey Smarmy Sycophant: do you actually ever DO ANYTHING?!?!?

Pence quotes the bible, implies God punished Katrina hurricane victims & argues it's not the job of gov't to help survivors rebuild. (video) https://twitter.com/funder/status/902614273607835649 …
#GRABTHEIRPUSSIES
The good initiative and efforts from Mr.Trump and his effective team.great America.
You guys are awesome
Is Fayette County going to be added to the list? I don't see it on DR-4332. Many families & businesses affected by the Colorado River flood

Here's Pence quoting Matthew 7:25 while urging Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort. Can't get any more phony. 
45* wants to cut disaster relief funding.
@VP Reminder: Mike Pence used the Bible to explain why we shouldn’t fund Katrina relief - deathandtaxes
We thank you Vice President Pence!
You're cutting FEMA and national flood programs.  And you voted against Katrina funding
Our prayers are with you all!
Where do we apply of werw unable to work?
please notify people that they only have 54 days to turn in Proof of Loss forms or they will be forever prohibited from making a claim.
We applied after chest deep #Harvey flood water came into our house but can't get help until declared disaster area. What's more disastrous?
@cathymcmorris why are you retweeting this when you're for fema cuts?!?!
Not an effective visual, @fema. My eyes skipped it multiple times. Please get someone to do a better job. Sure there would be volunteers.
Thank FEMA, US COAST GUARD
@KPRC2 Please note that people do NOT have to be in shelter to file eith FEMA. Can do so by phone or online

must be hard to do without electricity!

You post this via social media BUT did you ever think those truly impacted have no phone or computer anymore? That they have no battery?

“What a crowd, what a turnout,” Trump said from atop this firetruck, addressing hurricane victims. 
No power
Heads up TX
How are they supposed to get online, FEMA??
They usually start setting up in the shelters and will have other places to apply. Information from others like you and I give to others.
Why hasn't Jefferson County been declared a disaster with all the flooding?
Neither has hardin co that i know of
It would be nice, But they dont have power, computers or ANYTHING!

@HeyTammyBruce serious question: why does the government help groups affected by disaster, but not individuals? #HarveyFlood
There is rumor they have only until Sept 1st to apply for help. Is that true?  Asking for a state.
Not sure, heard something like that as true, apply before Friday. Not sure.
Housing, shelter, food, clothing, water, infrastructure, jobs, start with basics then work backwards.
Feed & House.
Dead people do not vote.
#Harvey2017 #GitErDoneTexas
Get, now FEMA has an excuse why they're going to be late to help this time around; bad cell reception.
Curious, is there any type of financial assistance for tens of thousands of Texans who are losing income due to Hurricane Harvey ?
Tried, your website says Montgomery County is not listed in the disaster declaration even though @GregAbbott_TX has included it in his. HELP
How does that work with no electricity, no computers and cell phone towers out?
You denied my application. So what else can I do. I am a victim of Hurricane Harvey and from Bay City, TX.
Reapply.
If they refuse again. Put it on this and social media will explode.
Sure will. Going to appeal.
Please RT!

I have a law degree. Am in retirement. Could be hired to assist with paperwork/ recovery. @ me.

Jefferson County Alligator Adventures? 8 more inches & 350 alligators will be loose?
Guys! This is looking more & more like Katrina X100...get more help! Time to call in the military?
Natl Guard has been there for days. This city of over 600 square miles. Search and rescue still not happen overnight.
this is what you are doing...? seriously? I'll be dead by then
This is what they are supposed to do
#HurricaneHarvery #houston #texas #Catastrophe #DisasterRecovery #disasterrelief #food #water #clothing #shelter #redcross #medicine #help
a home evacuation raft for floods will allow those along the Gulf Coast time to be rescued or get their families to safety
So people who lost everything and have no access to phone or internet are SOL?
Valid question - FEMA has crews that go door to door or are located at Disaster Resource Centers, locations should be posted soon
