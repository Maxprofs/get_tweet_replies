your state turned Red sir. Dems lost over a thousand seats this election cycle, the American public has spoken
and they will speak again!
you all realize it's NOT a #Muslim ban right!?!?!
then why are all of his cronies calling it that!
it's a 4 month band relax, they're welcome in ...not good enough?!?
no it's not!
well this is where we disagree.
What disgusts me is that any member of Congress would need my phone call to speak against this travesty. #NoBanNoWall
Amen!! I can't believe we, Americans, would have to pick up the freakin' phone and state the obvious. This has been the worst week ever!!
What worries me is that it's only Week 1 and clearly can get a WHOLE lot worse!
It will get worse. Michele, we saw this coming. We told ppl we weren't crying wolf. Now we are here in the midst of disaster
I saw it to everybody said I was a liar that I didn't know what I was talking about
Yes. Ppl told me that I was exaggerating, Trump was just throwing out red meat, fundamentals of USA were strong...
it's all about $$ . It always has been not people's rights
Senator u gut less human being this ban makes sense to protect our country
you want to ban innocent refugees because you're scared of terrorists, and you call others gutless?
listen I know it's hard 4 u 2 understand but terrorists hide among the refugees r all liberals this stupid
that's exactly what I said,you are afraid of secretly hidden terrorists amongst innocent people so you turn your back
yes I am and I don't want my tax dollars going to pay for them either just like we pay for illegals
Can't get thru to Schumer on any of the numbers. Started faxing
THANK YOU Senator Casey for your fight against tyranny
Maybe the #Islamics should stop killing people and blowing stuff up?
it's issis Islam is a religion stop spreading that miss conception around
It is #ISIS. And they are #Islamics. Thanks for reading http://CalNews.com .
might mention to @SenToomey his phones are never answered and his voicemail is always full.But I'm gonna start faxing!
I also called Toomey multiple times, left messages, voicemail full, also emailed. Crickets from him
I have gotten through to human in Toomey's office 2x this week. @SenBobCasey voicemail full-pls check it!
My experience opposite. Called local, Wash off4Toomey 6-7x never got person, did get thru2 Casey4x
my experience is opposite as well in fact I think this is an alternative fact
Ah, faxing... I was able to get thru and lv msg for @SenBobCasey before, but will consider fax #DumpDeVos
Thank you so much for speaking out against the #MuslimBan thanks for being my senator.
"...good people donâ€™t intend on doing anything evil for society, but bad people try to disrupt the normal working & thinking of the world."
.@SenBobCasey @mcuban
Casey needs to concern himself with Pennsylvania. I want my family protected. What's unAmerican about vetting?
syrians ALREADY go thru 18-24 month process. Today researchers in diabetes turned away. Babies & residents turned away.
thank you!  There is already a rigorous vetting process!  This is sheer persecution!
@546373Y @mcuban I've tried calling and emailing @SenToomey.  Apparently he can't read or hear.  NO RESPONSE.  YOU WORK FOR ME
it would be nice if @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn allowed constituents to leave a message. #spineless
@MichiganNation2 @mcuban promise of legal immigration
.@SenBobCasey .@mcuban how about this?
@HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @HouseGOP America is watching #TheResistance so stand up!
@brisdiva @mcuban you will be hearing from me.
America really needs to get rid of Trump just as soon as possible. Yesterday is not soon enough.
I called, emailed and snail mailed mine.
I get @ChuckGrassley 's voicemail. The only time a person answered was the first time I called. #Iowa
@puppymnkey @mcuban the voice mailbox is full
Shame the American Indians had no representation in Congress. Oh yeah, nobody remembers them.
no way
We're trying.  The phone lines are jammed and mailboxes full.
Casey is my representative and I say to him we need this ban to keep America safe
what is this promise you speak of and where can I find it? Where is it written?
Thank you, Senator, I will continue to call both you and @SenToomey daily to express my concerns
Thank you for your voice , Senator.  We haven't heard from your colleagues - What say you, @SenToomey & @RepMeehan ?
Can we also call the nearest Trump hotel and lodge a complaint there? With utmost politeness, of course. @SenBobCasey @mcuban #theresistance
#Stopthisnow #NoBanNoWall
We should all have a direct line to the Oval Office after the week we had. #NoBanNoWall
Thank you senator Casey! Also very delighted to hear that the ACLU stay against Trump's order is national.
no
Thank you!
Your my representative so "stop your opposition now"
I've tried calling all day, and my senators/rep's voicemail boxes are (purposely?) full
Should I send them all copies of "The Diary of a Young Girl" & "Night" or 1 of the 81 books on the Japanese Internment?
@VP @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump yes they need copies.
This is not the first time that Casey will respond to @mcuban But ignore his constituents. Hope Mark shows up in 2018. I won't.
when you have a verified acct, you get another tab in Twitter that shows verified tweets to you. 
I called my reps but they are dems I want a BIPARTISAN response to this NOW.
good luck getting through. They aren't talking calls...mailbox is full.
#silencethepeople
If only @SenToomey would check voicemail... I've been calling all week and it's always full.
thank you Sen.for standing up for human rights and encouraging others to follow suit! Proud of 1 of my PA Senators!!
Senator, you need to call for impeachment.
well I'm calling you right now Senator Casey. I am a homeowner in Pittsburgh so do what I VOTED for you to do
well I'm calling you right now Senator Casey. I am a homeowner in Pittsburgh so do what I VOTED for you to do, STOP HIM
I called you today SenCasey. Left a message. Ephrata, PA cares about immigrants. You should fight for their rights.
yes but you any other reasonable Republicans need to speak out against the #MuslimBan . I don't hear anything!
senator casey how fascists take over the US govt?? the beacon of hope for the world...how did this happen
@ellen_spins curious that their representatives lack the internal compass, that would not require being compelled.
calling your representatives has not done a damn thing all voicemails are full so come up with something else better
Arkansas Senators and Reps mailboxes are full or turned off.
you're one of my PA representatives Mr. Casey and I thank you for taking on the awful #MuslimBan!
...I will be first in line next election cycle to vote you OUT OF OFFICE
@TechGrlTweeter @mcuban can't be the land of the free if the oppressed can't get in#EllisIsland
no one said a word when Obama stopped Cuban refugees from coming ashore, only politics
All voice mails are full. And my Utah guys one of them @jasoninthehouse are being wined and dined by the Koch Brothers
I left you a voicemail to thank you! Unfortunately the voicemail boxes of @SenToomey and @MikeKellyPA are full. #NoMuslimBan
impossible to get through to my Representatives or leave a message.#frustrated
I tried calling @SenToomey today but he's not taking calls anymore. I guess he doesn't care about his PA constituents!
I'm tweeting you instead. Stop this Now. From Elk County, PA.
But @SenToomey and @MikeKellyPA simply don't care. They aren't listening.
i have been. i see no result. who in the senate stands and says, loudly, "this must stop now." i have hear no one.
@SenToomey Stop this now!
. @SenBobCasey @mcuban we are & they disconnect their phones & hide themselves away. So we take to the streets. Will they listen now?
Thank you, Senator. Stop this now!
As my Senator, I know that you are doing the right thing. My Rep- Congressman @RepBillShuster- not sure where he stands
Currently without representative here in LA after @XavierBecerra became CA Atty Gen. Is there anything else I can do?
For me, thats you...thank u 4 already addressing this tragic issue
don't forget your state voted for Trump, based on his well publicized policies, tho media tried to make it negative. @mcuban
Senator Casey I will contact your office Monday to thank you for your stance and encourage you to do more.
you are my senator- stop this NOW!!!
Mr. Casey: You're my rep. Stop this now!
I have tried my two congressmen and two senators. 4 closed offices, 4 full mailboxes. Next step?
@TWSnyderman @mcuban BLAH BLAH BLAH
Support the ban!
As a PA constituent, THANK YOU, Senator Casey
@roswell2001 Look at a nationwide county by county map of election, I think the people spoke loud and clear.
I will, you can count on it!
Thank you Sen. The eeviiill here is stunning. The abdication of our creed. And pulling this on Friday
I sent an email.cant get through by phone.
Where were you when your ex POTUS publicly told illegal immigrants there would be no repercussions if they voted?
Any tips on how to actually get a message through to @SenToomey? Time to hook up an old fax machine, I guess.
emails too!
How about your promise to support the President Trump won Pa support your people's choice.
You can't call! The phone lines are switched off. Try calling a Congressman.
Where is the 'promise' to take in enough outsiders to threaten our security? 
I'll refer u to France n Germany. 
Mess
great idea but.... mailbox full everywhere.
How is it that in 2017 with scalable cloud storage solutions we still face the issue of "this voicemail box is full"?
@RepErikPaulsen I have a representative who has gone underground, he is silent, will not respond to emails What next?
there's another vote in a couple years, check another box!
Does anyone have current phone list with phones that actually work?
just tried to call @tedcruz. His mailbox is full yet he stays silent.
He will continue to move farther towards nationalism and fascism till he finally gets push back
It not nice for to that to happen in America best country ever with so much power
well then you stop rubber stamping of trump nominees.  Vote NO on trump nominees and bills
a President actually living up to his campaign promises!! How revolting!! #sarcasm
Casey do you even care about people who have lost there lives or is all just a agenda for you worried about election
we do call- @SenToomey s voicemail is always full, they won't allow constituents into building,we never get a response
It's weekend and many voicemail boxes are full. Cover the floors of their offices in angry faxes.
I believe in Charity starts at home ! America First..... #MakingAmericaGreatAgain
But most Senators offices are closed and won't let us leave messages. We want to do this now.
we are too late. We, they let the wolf in the hen house already.
@POTUS implementing the will of the American citizens.  Safety 1st for us.  Soro's paid protesters.  Keep us safe.
does this mean I don't need to call your office on Monday? #RefugeesWelcome #thankyou
what does calling do? This is 2017. See the reactions on twitter and social media and do something ...phone calls?
so y'all are going to vouch for ALL the refugees being peace loving kind warm hearted people?  just take your word eh?
- I keep calling our PA crew @SenToomey & @RepTimMurphy :  they don't care - it's party over country for them....Sad!
the fact a call needs to be made is a problem. But a call from the masses isn't gonna change anything.
- @WhiteHouse @SpeakerRyan shut down phone lines! Reps should b outraged by action of pres! We should not have 2 call!
We're calling you right now. Gather up some friends, roll up your sleeves + stop this blasphemy. @SenBobCasey cc:@mcuban
ok stop this now!
Hey bozos - you understand he was elected to do precisely what he has done? Elections have consequences - have you heard that before? #trump
I believe in the LAW something you know nothing about Casey do your job confirm Trumps cabinet picks!!
Terrorists around the world are celebrating the stupidity and ignorance of @POTUS @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr .
im on it! Done with @realDonaldTrump
Americans need to impeach that bastard. It requires unlimited march. It can take months like in Ukraine. Don't go home!
Love you Mark, but don't count on any of them to stand up. Especially @jasoninthehouse . He has no morals.
25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 25/4 that's what you do!!!
Senator Casey - we coordinate and call everyday .  What should we say specifically to provoke response ?
@DHayesstoker @mcuban what is going
First Casey is a total pandering ,PC perfect DORK. Secondly Trump told us what he would do & is doing it,thus elected
yes, but our elected leaders (d or r) need to LEAD
would but @RepRyanCostello doesn't seem to know how to check his VM.
Please tell @SenToomey to unblock his phones!! All 8 offices have full voicemail boxes. He's a disgrace. He is unreachable.
I have tried to call numerous times throughout the week and have had similar results.
Congrats, @mcuban for getting a response from my Senator Bob Casey. He never responds to me.
You have to have a big bank account!!
Canada will help by taking in people. What else can we do to help? This is a global concern not just U.S.
donate to groups like the @ACLU and CAIR - they're fighting it in the courts & need support
are offices open on Saturday night?
I am APPALLED that @SenToomey has been silent. @RepCharlieDent spoke but nothing from Toomey. This needs to stop now.
