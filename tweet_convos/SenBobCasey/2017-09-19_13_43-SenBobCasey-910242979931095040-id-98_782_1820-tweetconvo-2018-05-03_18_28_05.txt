Graham on building support for health care: "I've got Alan Greenspan, Jeb Bush, and Steve Bannon. If you can do better than that, call me."
Lolz. I can find better on the bottom of my litter box.
These guys are reknowned heAlth care experts?
Don't have me, either. But we have AARP, veterans, healthcare providers, governors, the voting majority of the USA.  Better much better.
Uh...Steve f'ing BANNON? Graham is saying that walking Petri dish is an ally? Is this some kinda reverse psychology?
Apparently that’s not important to GOP!
#SteveBannon! #Graham is bragging about scouring the gutter for support!
Retweet
GOPGENOCIDE is #GrahamCassidy  by assimilation of the poor and ill American Citizens. You call yourselves  Christians! NOT GOP don't care!
LOL Senator-u have greatest tweet of today.
We have WAY better than losers like Bannon, Kochs, etc!! #SaveOurCare!! #REJECTGrahamCassidy!!
You are all liars!
@LindseyGrahamSC forgot to add his Koch backers.
Sadly, by getting Bannon, he gets Breitbart which Steve will use to lie and trick people into tepid support.
And the non profit medical sector!
Bob,,,get out there and SHOW how your constituents will be horribly hurt by this freaking bill...OMG
When he gets Don Berwick on board, let me know!
Yea Casey what about the unborn, don't they have rights too.
Sure we can do better than that group how about the Devil his very self
How about any of the major medical associations? AARP? Major insurers?
Hey Bob, why do you keep voting to give more money to the military when it could be better spent on other things to help the American people

Graham shows he true colors on this monstrous healthcare bill He won't condone racism but he will accept causing suffering and death to ppl
None of those people vote on the actual bill. And I find it hard to believe Jeb Bush would agree to this exact bill.
I believe you did in fact do better sir
@MillenPolitics @marykbruce @AARPadvocates @LLSAdvocacy @AmerMedicalAssn @hospitals4kids @PPact @MarchofDimes @American_Heart
That happens in a democracy.  We're no democracy any longer. The people simply do not matter .
Graham has rounded the corner. He's drinking the Trump cool-aid how much do the Kochs pay you, Lindsey?
Steve Bannon?? That doesn't sound real.  Why would he say that?
I think it was a “I’ve got support from all colours of conservatives” kind of statement. Whatever it was, it certainly backfired! 
here's what he's got -https://t.co/z9j2VofyHB?amp=1
Oh @senatorBobCasey no one in office now cares about them. Maybe the very few who are working to regain oder & some semblance of sanity.
Dems started this shit show when they crammed ACA down our throats..You made this mess..
Sen.Casey how about Pennsylvania ppl?  U hurt middle class constantly!  ObamaCare stole from SS which u Supported! VOTE OUT CASEY 2018 MAGA
Not hard to do better than that.

@LindseyGrahamSC How about just 4 of ur constituents that are gonna lose their healthcare?
They don't care and we are feeling broken.  Who will protect us? Not the republicans and Dems can't do anything. @SenJohnMcCain won't
Bannon? Bannon? You kidding me?????
Steve Bannon?!?!
Proud to have won over Steve Bannon?
Seems to have forgotten who signs his paycheck.
How about you do your job and reduce the debt you are responsible for and return your salary until you have a plan in place?
Side. One, how the fuck is "populists" Bannon okay with a bill that will kill people?

Alan Greenspan! World renowned expert on health care policy.

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
Americans has been known to be strong people, But are the American people strong enough to love ?
Oh, we'll be calling...
That's a good answer, Sen Casey, but you don't listen 2 or represent the people either.  DemParty has been exposed 4 the fraud that it is.
Or, you know, the medical professionals?
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @SenateMajLdr don't care about the American People. Mitch's own actions party before country. 2018!
Ask yourself that question when you support sanctuary cities and DACA.
I'm with you, @SenBobCasey. I'm also hoping that @SenToomey will also oppose this bill for the sake of his fellow Pennsylvanians.
remember Bob:the banana-republicans mantra is ......"American's 1st""..................yeah right!
Bob, they are American people. Ya gotta step up your game. Tell us how those guys are nothing to brag about, please.
Hopefully Legal American ppl
Apparently we are simply the serfs!
You have my support Senator Casey!
Thank you for your support, @SenBobCasey !! Thank you for standing up for healthcare.
The American people want full coverage. #MedicareForAll
C/O  @LindseyGrahamSC
Was he joking? I hope he was joking
No. We want health care for all
Proud of our Senator! from north western PA!
I think I can do WAY better. Steve Bannon?!?!?  JFC

How about Medicare For All?
Not Medicare for everyone! Legal AMERICANS who have worked and gov. took money out of their pay checks without a say!
I couldn't possibly do worse!
Stevie Nazi Bannon? 
That's the Damn Bar?
#wearescrewed
Exactly! Good to know a few old white guys back a healthcare bill for something they don't need
Give our healthcare INSURANCE back to us to buy on our own. I don't need women's health issues covered in my plan. #DemLies

This bill will literally kill Americans on their own soil. Why does the @GOP want to do this?
Seriously Steve Bannon is now a positive on your side. Wow that was fast 8 months from pariah to Norm to expert
I would call him. ;)
(202) 224-5972. Call Sen Lindsay Graham
senator Casey....just worry about us in Pa
Quite the lineup. 3 private citizens who once were in government? Huh.
The AMA and the AARP are opposed and they represent doctors, patients, and elderly. How's that for a start? @LindseyGrahamSC
They are both groups that lose out when the golden ticket of gov't is removed from the equation. The only thing the want is your $$$$$$$$$$$
"But these 3 are rich white guys, what do actual normal Americans know about middle class issues?"
I'm pretty sure my 14 year old doesn't care what any of those people think. She just wants me to beat cancer and her to have insurance.
Steve Bannon?
Is this why GOP is kissing trumps ass??  Does Putin own them Too??
They Don't have ME

#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
The majority of Americans think Graham Cassidy is a travesty. Does the GOP NOT listen to their constituents. No one wants this!!
his committee. Plus, Senator Corker has expressed massive tax cuts may not be the answer right now. Stand up for those you represent.
Greenspan's meaning was so obscure as Fed Chair because he was lying.
Did you call him?
They want single payer
That's right. Hopefully my Senators, @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander, can join forces. I believe Senator Alexander has a plan underway in
Bob - do you know mt Grahams CELL number? Call him!! Plus it it along so we can call him. I need a CELL number.
Republicans stopped caring about the American people a looooooong time ago.
Uhhhh, what a sad crew...
That actually sounds like what Graham would say to intentionally sabotage the bill...
We don't count.
Call him.
