Intercepted calls show Trump campaign members had repeated contact with Russian intelligence before the election http://nyti.ms/2kvdm5O 
So true! We need a FULL investigation!
TERM LIMITS
@coasterinoregon Sen. Bob, this is going global; see Newsweek article. US will be judged outside @GOP control. Sad.
@USvTrump   it's very early into the discovery process of #Putingate ... don't let up!
Yet you were never that concerned that @POTUS44 went to university as a foreign exchange student with grants?! Hypocrite!
.Why didn't FBI,CIA,NSA tell ComInChief Obama of intercepted calls at his Dec Intel Briefings?Co-conspirators?
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. If Hillary were the President and this happened, impeachment hearings would have already begun.
@DemsTalk Damn Right it requires investigation! What r TEA party Reps like @TomColeOK04  hiding bcs they say no investigation
this should not be a question. The independent committee of investigators should have been activated already.
Thank you for standing up! #RightSideofHistory #TheResistance
did President Obama authorize the wire Taps on Flynn?
who is investigating the FBI leaks. Are you at all upset about that no. 2018
no you are a solid democrat. You are pretty strait line there. No need to fake it now lol.
You say that like it's a insult. Republicans & Trump trash are going down. Best start paying attention to actual news
@CoryBooker no confirmation on Gorsuch until a Special Prosecutor is appointed #impeachtrump
That's actually a really good idea! Hope they listen to you.
@CoryBooker @nytimes Unfortunately integrity is in very short supply in the Republican Party.
@CoryBooker this is exactly right and SOON
Do you care that sensitive, possibly illegally obtained information was given directly to the media?
True. Thank you for sticking up for constituents and nation. How can we get our other Senator on board? @SenToomey
Thank you Senator Casey for standing up for the truth, and what's right!
@LoquitaAngel @SIMASTRGrace 
#IfItLooksLikeADuck..Well....you get it  
#ExpediteInvestigation
#QuestionofSecurity
DC pedophiles going down. Are you involved? I bet yes. Who wins this battle Trump or the Deep State IC? You seem awfully nervou
Have you noticed the sex traffic arrests around the country the last few weeks? Sandusky- Deep State trying to divert from this
LOUDER #LOUDER Start talking So that everyone can hear you - #CarryABigStick!
@CoryBooker amazing that you're not concerned about the security leaks
Special Prosecutor needs to be appointed tomorrow, if this is confirmed how can any Republican or Democrat still support Trump?
same way you still voted for crooked Hillary
@SenToomey - what's your position on this situation? Are you ready to stand up for democracy or are you still toeing the line?
LOL.
but Hillary was innocent..... you were not worried about integrity of our democracy then????
What type of independent investigation?
GET THEM OUT TODAY, LIKE FLYNN. They're still doing business w/Russia. Or does the Nation have to take to the streets again????
You don't care if the law was followed? Was there a FISA warrant obtained to record Flynn, a US Citizen?
Hey @SenToomey are you sure you want to be a part of this? Because right now every. single. Republican. is complicit.
you've been happily working w/Putin's Puppet. Join @SenBobCasey Stand up for our country. Otherwise, you're just as bad as Trump.
oh and your candidate was an angel.... HaHa
The people need to continue the resistance. I predicted a HUGE SCANDAL & it wasn't one month yet. This admin is full w/ #LIARS
@LauraVanVleet Name one other campaign where this Ever happened before!!!
Absolutely! I encourage you to work together with like-minded Senators and Representatives, and end this national nightmare!!
thank you!  Those with sense know it is - and always has been -about integrity.  What a demoralizing  time for our country.
@The1HonestVoice
contact AG Schneiderman, NY, he has plenty of exp, info and investigation practice with Trump and Russia.
@lnewday The integrity of our democracy gave its death rattle when hrc was supported in stealing #DNC nomination.
Definately, we are all in this together---(except the Republicans ) we all know they only care about power & control
if this is true then all other congressional activity most stop until hearings of these issues are completed.
How can we make this happen?
@CoryBooker What's the name of that song,"How Long Has This Been Going On?"@maddow @ACLU @amnestyusa @MarkRuffalo @MalcolmNance
happend under Obama administration though. If there was something to be done, he should have done it.
"The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation."
what do any of you people know about integrity? If you guys did a lot of you guy wouldn't be in the position your in, period.
I vote dems get investigated.. U Seem dirty to me..you were the ones supporting @HillaryClinton & shes crooked as one can get!
thank you, @SenBobCasey. You are absolutely right, and we, the american people, are 100% behind you. go get 'em.
@washingtonpost why is the GOP not worried about Russia and the election involvement&only worried about who is leaking the info
This requires an immediate impeachment!
Get your colleagues on board, Senator, and make it happen.
WOW Bobby you are so insightful
GET them!!!
@CoryBooker @RepKevinCramer @SenateGOP @SenatorHeitkamp @SenJohnHoeven  Do Your JOBS! Shame on you ALL & your SILENCE. Act NOW!
Just like secret Iran nuclear deal??
nailed it
well I hope you and the Dems are ready to call him out. Otherwise next election I'm going independent
thank you Senator Casey for all your hard work!
make it so
LOCK HIM UP
BYW. It is a DEMOCRATIC thing
why don't you start focusing on jobs, our safety, rising gas, utility and food prices for people of PA instead of this crap
thank you.
@MelissaFazli So we're suppose to believe NYT has better intel than Obama? Well...maybe
Thank you Senator Casey!  Don't back down! We are terrified of the direction our country is taking.
I agree. Unfortunately I have a feeling it will go the way of investigations into Obama scandals. Government protects its own.
@CoryBooker Trump is #putinspuppet in a blind GOP America. Hope those with integrity will open their eyes and see.
Washington DC is collapsing - we see it on the outside looking in - you are on the inside and don't seem to see it
@CoryBooker @nytimes please call for a full investigation and impeachment
Thank you. Totally agree!
@SimonLondonVC Who is authorised to be independent enough? Surely this is a matter for the Senate to handle immediately?
@2020pleasehurry Not only an investigation but a new election! How many in the GOP compromised themselves for power!?
@okielivin
Thanks for Russia/Trump Campaign info push! Paul Manafort, Carter Page also material witnesses. Pattern emerging.
@doloresquintana we are a republic not a democracy.
@Lonestarmomcom Country before party is the only way to be a #patriot
@2020pleasehurry Please don't let this be swept under the rug by GOP. I'm losing my faith in our government
@CoryBooker Do it, please!!
I want know how long they've had these intercepted calls?? Why are we only finding out now? #Flynnghazi
@CoryBooker 
OPERATIVE WORD being INDEPENDENT.
very true but @GOP still going to be held accountable for being hypocrites.
@CoryBooker thank you gentlemen. The people want to know #WhatDidYouKnow #WhenDidHeKnowIt
our "DEMOCRACY" was at stake when Trump was elected, this isn't the warning it's the clarion call. #takeamericaback #resist
.@SenBobCasey It's time to begin impeachment proceedings against both the president and vice president.
absolutely our democracy is at stake.  Keep the thorn in his side.
do we really want America to turn into a keystone Cops comedy... nobody's laughing
Proud of you @SenBobCasey  Wish I could say the same about @SenToomey
Yes! But can you get through to GOP?
Exactly. GOP should want to know truth. If not, they are cowards and/or liars.
@CoryBooker @nytimes GO. GET. THEM.
So you base that on an article by the same @nytimes that is constantly caught producing fake news?
Are you gullible or corrupt?
@CoryBooker #TraitorTrump
Sally Yates for Independent Prosecutor!
@nytimes yes sir and right now.
@CoryBooker Yes this is a Republican created problem & no 1 is holding them responsible but I do agree it'll be ALL our problem
My sentiments exactly. The truth will set us free!!
@CoryBooker Yes, an investigation into Obamas minions. Took down Flynn so he couldnt expose the Iran Deal BS. Karmas a bitch
thank you Senator Casey for continually speaking out and standing up for our democratic values!
Lets have the Truth about failed candidate Hillary ClintonThat story Is More Sensational and about betrayal of USA
@CoryBooker #treasonskindofabigdeal
@CoryBooker And we MUST see his taxes.  We all know they will be revealing.
@CoryBooker nails it.
@CoryBooker. Investigate Hillary instead and where is the outrage of Obama peddling his book while in office.conflict
do Reps realize that Trump isn't the type to "go down with his ship"? He'll take ALL the lifeboats and vests for himself& leave
you Alt Left just don't give up,no one cares about the Russians except you poor losers looking for an excuse for Clinton's loss

Come on give Trump a pass. You let Hillary get away with everything!
@CoryBooker Thank you for protecting our Democracy!
Does the Saying "my my my, what a tangled web we weave when we first practice to deceive" mean anything to all.
Tomorrow?! Clinton was almost impeached quickly for getting a blow job! Isn't this worse?! Stand up for the US please!
@CoryBooker make it happen!!
@nytimes Ty senator keep up the good work :D
oy vey
Yes, and any person in either House of Congress who doesn't degree should just admit they don't care about America!
@CoryBooker  treasonous trump
@CoryBooker Don't back down. Be patriots. Integrity is right. Current WH leadership lacking ethics.
@CoryBooker @nytimes Being pragmatic about it, convincing the GOP controlled Congress of is not going to be easy.
@CoryBooker yes and we need to move fast. Russia is at our shoreline
@StephEvz43 Then get off your ass, stop talking and start doing something.
when will this be announced? When???
same thing not you not democrats will we listen to
keep losing elections, losers. Take some accountability of DNC corruption mass exodus from Dem happening
@nytimes I for once agree with you Mr. Casey
so what does that change any of the actions discovered? Where's the accountability there? No acknowledgment No Win
We are Republicans that agree with this 100%.
@CoryBooker as well as the entire US government taking all it can from its people and destroying the middle class
@CoryBooker oh stop. Get to work would ya and stop grandstanding. Annoying. Do the job your paid to do and stop the nonsense
@CoryBooker Y es, please. What will it take?
what about our Secretary of State's receiving millions of dollars from the Saudis? It's PROVEN Saudi ties to ISIS
I am begging you to stay in this.
ass focus on 30k who died of opiods, the sex assaults at PSU & why r illegal alliens in our state using my taxpayer $$
@Bebeknows @nytimes thank God for the New York Times!!!
We need an to protect the operational security of our military, infrastructure, foreign service, finance, and world
like giving Clinton the debate questions? Oh wait, that's the DNC
@CoryBooker Is Trump the Manchurian Candidate? #ManchurianTrump
@CoryBooker sadly they won't act.  Our democracy is less important than their hold on power.
@CoryBooker @SenSchumer  @ChrisMurphyCT Let's keep the fire going and force them to #doyourjob Thank you!
@CoryBooker Thank you both!
@CoryBooker - ya think?
@laesqmom this is an American issue
@OmVArvind haha, I'm all for an investigation. But these congressman acting like they give a damn about "integrity" 
these lying snakes will do anything and everything to stay in power.
@CoryBooker to bad the republican congress is more attached to the party instead of our Country.
@CoryBooker I still find this an amazing news story. It's hard to believe the arrogance of the @realDonaldTrump campaign
@CoryBooker @GOPoversight @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @GOP #GOP's coverup of #Russiagate, if it continues, is #treason.
@CoryBooker it is a @GOP issue, that party is guilty of treason. #impeachtrump #impeachryan
@CoryBooker thank you! Yes! This is not about party this is about our country!!
@CoryBooker Agree, but why is @GOP so slow to get on board?
@CoryBooker please--the integrity of our great country is at stake! Please fight for us!
@CoryBooker mark my words this scandal goes all the way up to Trump!
@CoryBooker  behind you 100%. Go clean house!
@CoryBooker I agree.  Republicans have said Republicans don't investigate Republicans.
I wish you were my Senator. Please keep fighting for all Americans against this evil.
@CoryBooker Joe McCarthy would have asked you out, too.
@CoryBooker I appreciate you saying this, so please walk the walk!
When is someone in Congress going to subpoena Trump's tax returns to find out why Russia has him by the balls?
@CoryBooker Forget independent. ANYBODY , SOMEBODY lead the investigation.
Seems like we've elected a proxy Russian administration...
we are victims of a Russian coup, we need regime change!
#SupportIndependentInvestigation.
YUP. AND PRONTO. Like American lives depend on it.
Shut down congress until the treason is FULLY investigated. We are with you #resist
Yes! An independent investigation must be launched.
#WeThePeople
what about Russian spy ship off of Delware and the fly-byes in the Black Sea?! SRSLY WTH is going to have to happen 2 stop it?
Get your colleagues in Trumps Rubber Stamp Reichtag to do something. Ryan and McConnell will do everything to bury this.
so get off Twitter and do something
@LongIslander57 @nytimes absolutely!
We the people demand an independent investigation into Trumps ties with Russia! Thank you Sen Casey for putting country first.
Please work for a new, legit mate election.
@cbba21 @nytimes I don't know Sen Casey but I bet he's a Democrat.
Yes, & WORKING for PA
 --unlike his counterpart @SenToomey who's in hiding except to vote GOP party-line.
If you're waiting for our permission, you have it. Get started!
