The only way to get those answers is through an independent investigation and special prosecutor. https://www.facebook.com/1284477371605413?story_fbid=1284477371605413&id=107749545944874 â€¦
.@SenBobCasey What Senator Bob doesn't say, is that ALL 80,000 came from @Rosie. She's got plenty of time on her hands. #FailingCareer #MAGA
aww aren't you cute while you're delusional! Because everyone loves 45 all 35% of you
as opposed to the 65% and growing  of us who actually want answers, and write & call our Sen to get them
Thank you Senator Casey for hearing us and working for us
"MomFarts" thinks you're making a real difference! It showed in the election 
you think the word farts makes you smarter than me, honey? Everyone farts. Senator Casey did very well in his election.
Trump on the other hand, had almost 3 million votes less than Clinton. But hey, congratulations!
Should I write too?  I am from PA & I believe that you know that we need answers from an indepen. commission.
yes, write, call and tell Senator in hiding @PatToomey as well
I demand answers on why Hillary ok'd sale of WY Uranium to Russians & Podesta's holding in Russia funded co. @realDonaldTrump
Poor thing!  Don't you know Hillary is ethical unlike Repub thugs
#fakenews She did not!

@expatina @realDonaldTrump as long as @DevinNunes is heading the committee, the answers will be deflected
working our way to independent investigation we deserve.
it's the only way @SpeakerRyan will never step up
Yes, please no Ryan
The Nepotism in the White House is also a grave concern. @OfficeGovEthics
Closing ranks
80,000 people asking because they got nothing. Desperate for something.
I want to know why Hillary gave plutonium to Russia... Figure that one out first.

Fake news!  Give us one shred of actual evidence after a year long investigation at taxpayers expense!  Criminal!
How many have written for answers on possible ties between @DevinNunes  and @realDonaldTrump
Haven't we looked into this for months and found nothing?  Get over your election loss, move on and give this man a chance.
Thank you @SenBobCasey!
Use @botresist as a quick way to FAX your Congressional leaders! #TheResistance #Indivisible
well then let me ask you for answers on Clinton's & Clinton foundation ties, & the sale of our uranium Senator

what about uranium sales to Russia by Obama/Hillary Clinton administrations? Seems more treasonous than a hotel deal?

I was one of them @SenBobCasey -thank you for listening and taking our message to heart. We need a president who cares. #FiretheFool
Wow! Bet there's a whole lot more nation wide!! 65,844,610++++++!!!
TRUMP'S  AIDES MAY HAVE HAD CONTACTS WITH RUSSIA IN THE PAST IN DOING BUSINESS JUST LIKE EVERYOTHER AMERICAN. NO BIG DEAL, TRUMP IS REAL!
And check all Clinton's ties also..where's OUR uranium Bobby.. millions in donations to their phoney foundation.. I DARE YOU

Lol suffer from neo McCarthyism much ?
80,001: Dear Sen Casey, I demand answers regarding the links between Russia & the Trump campaign & administration.
Make it 80,001. My postcard was in the mail yesterday but looks like Mike Flynn helped our cause!
Give 'em hell, Bob.
Make that 81001 ! #resistance #TrumpRussiaCollusion
are you willing to stand up against the tyranny of Trump and Pence? It's a fake presidency.
You should be proud of your constituents for being so involved in our democracy. Now do all that you can to give them the answers.
They R Like Us N Cali They Don't Feel @Trump Election Is Legitimate!!
I agree. A Independent Investigation in mandatory to get to the bottom of this embarrassing situation.
They must feel pretty stupid,  your votes went for a corrupted administration.
@SenBobCasey provide the proof that 80K have written you. I demand answers to why Judges dont have to enforce the Constitution.
I wonder how many of those 80,000 people voted for Trump.
Those were those damn Brock Bot!
wow.
Make that 80,001.
thank you for listening to you constituents. wish more of your colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in both houses, would do the same.
you're a great Senator!  We NEED answers now!!!!!!
Make that 80,003.
and faxed too! #russiagate #RussiaGate
I petition for Podesta to be investigated for blatant stupidity.  He fell for a phishing scam. The Russians got his email.
Sen Casey if not you then who, if not now then when....we are circling the drain.
and there are millions who want answers to ties of some Democrats and Russia. WikiLeaks says they didn't do it
Release his taxes
I agree with you totally!  Such ties, if proven, shake the very foundation of our country!
work on vets awaiting backlog for years on yes or no decisions! Meet criteria or don't why wait years? 2003-?
@wbrewyou @realDonaldTrump Why don't u do something for PA?! Roads suck, bridges crumbling, no jobs, heroin everywhere!
Who keeps voting for you?
Add my voice. I am a Russian historian at @FandMCollege teaching a course on Putin; the links are harrowing.
thank you Sen Casey for listening to your constituents. We demand answers from an independent investigation!
@smille5884 @realDonaldTrump You mean 80,000 Pennsylvania Trump voters who were so concerned with Hillary's harmless emails?
Yet your Senate colleague from our great state still aligns with Trump on every issue.
#WeNeedMoreLikeYou
And yet, I still wait for your reply as a SuperDelegate in August 2008. Ted Kennedy did rply tho he was dying.
63 million think that he had nothing to do with what he is being accused, by only Democrats, Did you notice?
Thank you for standing up for us and actually *listening* to your constituents....unlike @SenToomey
What about the power of the Israel lobby in the USA?...
#corruption #ZOG #Trump #TrumpRussia
@vikingmother123 @realDonaldTrump please keep pushing forward Senator Casey!!!
@POTUS   still can't believe you're in WH
We'll continue to call and write to you & our other reps. Our country deserves better than #45.
@kakempen @realDonaldTrump go get them Senator Casey.
that's not many snowflakes they'll melt and go away with all this winning
that's encouraging.  People are really waking up to what has been elected to the WH and no doubt Congress
Answers better be forthcoming or some senators and congressmen will have very short careers!
So will you demand Nunes step down too?
Now multiply that by every elected official in DC from all 50 states. #DoyourJob Gain our trust!
Keep talking up the false narrative Boob like the good partisan hack you are.  4 months + with no proof.
@rdreynola @realDonaldTrump We are so disgusted with @DevinNunes
why no concern for @HillaryClinton ties when Secretary of State hmm?
@yogigirl626 @realDonaldTrump sure they have and mitt Romney never paid his taxes
Allegheny resident here in Oakmont 15139. Add me.We need answers. It's not about party. It's about our country
@Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump Thank you for speaking out. Count my voice among the 80,000
Yes we know it must be brought to light
I agree.
don't feel sorry for them .. the state went for #Trumprussia
@Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump  I will start writing. .from a Democrat who DID NOT vote for the orange beast
make that 80001
@uncivilobedient @realDonaldTrump - Let's see answers then! Now.
And I was one of them
You can add me to that list of ppl who want @realDonaldTrump investigated!
As they should. We need answers.

Like vacationing 9 times in two months costing taxpayers almost $30m? Make Vacations Great Again

Thank you, Senator Casey! So proud you represent #RealPA  18902
I'm bone of them. Thanks for pursuing.

I'm one of those callers. Keep pushing, Senator. Thank you.
@HITEXECUTIVE @realDonaldTrump #FilibusterGorsuch
@HITEXECUTIVE @realDonaldTrump Probably the same ones in the State who gave him the electoral votes needed to win
judging from the responses, looks like I'm 80,020ish!
80'001
I'll write another one! Thank you for your answer on Gorsuch!
YES! We need trump and everyone in the White House investigated with special prosecutor.
yep and. I am one of them! Keep pushing Senator Casey!!
I am curious on why you didn't push for investigating Hillary like this when we wanted answers then.
@HITEXECUTIVE @realDonaldTrump #InvestigateNow #TheTruthIsOutThere #TheWholeWordIsWatching
make that 80,001. Time for a real investigation.
Did you include the DNC role with Russia in the possible ties?
DNC was the victim
Podesta was stupid enough to fall for a phishing scam. They deserved to lose. 
while this is important, I'm more concerned about the high cost of health care.
There are so many concenrs. I called to demand answers on all of it. #Answers
So...
My postcard is on its way--count me in!
"The case for an independent commission and special prosecutor only grows."  Please continue to push for it.
Senator Casey, please tell Sen McCain & Graham thank you for putting country before party in regards to Russia
80k is not a small number and that's just one state! #resist #Trumprussia
I'm sure he'll have more flexibility after the election. Sorry, that was Obama that said that to Russia.
We need a Reset button like Hillary had except we should spell it right.
Stop being Schumer's lap dog and work on issues that improve the quality of life for all Pennsylvanians.
And the remaining 12,000,000 want a health care plan that works, jobs, safety, and for a gov to get it done.
talk to Mitch and his cronies. They stopped up government for 8 years
Think I care what side?  Tired of gov taking half of everything I have and wasting it!!!!!!
Then run for office. Participate. Good help is appreciated but hard to find.
Are you going to feed my family?  I am working 80hrs a week to do that now?
written/called, but it's been a while. So many issues so little time. I hope someone reads your twitter feed!
I believe I am included in that 80,000. If not, make it 80,001.
how about working to get public funding of elections to stop corruption of elected politicians through campaign contributions?
Be serious. Bobby is the least effective Senator. But he is a great lap dog. Good a parroting Schumer's venom.
you got my letter. @POTUS I sent you one too! 
80,000 need to ask their fellow Pennsylvanians how were they duped into voting for the dope
Full investigation required. Dirty Don The Con must go!
80,002 here. I want to know also. Love to also know if Stein was paid to eat caviar with Vlad.
hey Bob...how about we investigate why you guys never get anything done #selfinterest
You can thank Mitch McConnel and his crew for 8 years of moving at a crawl
me too! There's too much smoke not to investigate!
Lock him up!!!
I gave a call and a fax, thanks for listening. GETT'EM!
wild goose chase or witch hunt...probably not what we pay you to do. Swamp Boy  #MAGA  lots of potholes in PA

You can include me on the list Senator. Thank you!
- add me to the list.  I haven't written your office to ask you to do it bc I know you are already "on it"
my thoughts exactly!!
I guess Republicans aren't getting the same messages?  I've been writing mine.
Show us the 80k bob. Not really believing u have that many. If not. We will FOIA them.
did you explain the Clinton ties to Russia?
According to Trump, he's never met Putin, Russia might not be real and Sally Yates is a "danger to our security"! 
Russia is fake news!
everything in 2017 is fake something.
Fake president.....
wow that less than one percent of the people in philadelphia let alone the state
80,000 and 1.  Waiting for something to be done about Trump before it's too late.
how many calls? (I think I've called AND faxed.)
make it 80,002. We need answers to this question before we believe anything else that comes out 1600 PA Ave.
did you feel the same way about crooked hillary. Time to move on obstructionist
Change the channel from Fox, Alex Jones, Rush ,Levine Open your eyes
I sincerely hope those 80K did not vote for he who shall not be named!!
Make it 80,001! Thanks for the reminder. This must be investigated impartially now! There is reasonable cause!
.. make it 80,001!
And Nunes should not only recuse himself, he should be removed entirely from the Committee.
should be charged with obstruction..but wait, he has different stories, needs time to collaborate
Thank you, Bob
make it 80,000 and 1
Falafel Andrew insists there's nothing to see here.
