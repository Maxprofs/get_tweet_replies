#BREAKING: Senate advances DeVos nomination, setting her up for final vote http://hill.cm/pb0ub0Y  
You just don't get it do you? ALL of @realDonaldTrump nominees WILL BE confirmed. #MAGA
Debate won't convince them. You need to reach out one on one.
@MMstrikesback @thehill thank you Senator Casey
Need you Senator.  We will help you...you help us...the Republic depends on it
Thank you! Unqualified - a dangerous appointment.
Keep up the pressure! We are with you @usedgov
Shut the department down. It's a waste.
Because we just need one more charter school in Dallas.Not! 
http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2017/02/01/dallas-charter-took-kids-deion-sanders-failed-school-faces-shutdown â€¦ #BetsyDeVos
@decaro_nick @thehill Use the remaining hours to see how much more money she can come up with then tell her no
All @GOPSenate They are in her pocket.
@thehill DRAG THEM
she is incompetent and has shown she doesn't even care to learn.
that's valid and a big problem. Easy parents might be a part.
we oppose devos. #DeVosvote
totally unqualified vs. Many phd. Educators across this nation
good luck next election! We don't pay for political games! We pay 4 you to do ur job & what ur district wants!
I am begging you not to confirm DeVos. She's unqualified.Kids in PA will suffer, your name will be stained for decades
@dremmelqueen @usedgov thank you for the fight!
keep at it! The nation's children will thank you! @SenCapito be the one who stands for education. Please.
Thank you so much for this great work!!!
thank you Bob Casey.
Thank you Sen Casey for listening to your constituents and continuing this important fight unlike @SenToomey
if you are pro choice then why would you deny parents the right to choose where to school kid
hypocrite to pick and choose pro choice options weather it be education or life
Senator Casey. As a PA voter, I fully support the appointment of Mrs DeVos to be Sec Ed. Hoping for quick confirmation
can I ask why ? Which of her qualifications do you support ?
I have asked several other of her supporters the same questions but I never get an answer. I am truly curious
Mrs.DeVos has fought for the rights of parents and children to receive the quality education they deserve.
Wow that's a general and vague answer. That would not mean much on a resume.
Its Twitter, difficult for a dissertation. But, she is a charter/private school advocate, vouchers, etc.
I know that! That is not the answer to our education problems! That does not make her qualified
First EdSec under Carter was a Circuit Ct Judge. Most are political appt. First actual teacher was Rod Paige under GWB
@karenannmilo @usedgov @thehill Debate your heart's out
buy Pat Toomey's vote
Sen toomey will not be re elected again
We hope he assists you.
so how does this happen!!?? Toomey isn't budging is he? Who is on the fence??
I'm a Libertarian but I voted for you. DeVos isn't important. Dept of Ed isn't important. Close it.
We don't even need a Fed Dept of Education. Get rid of it.
@thehill Thank you Senator. I wish we could clone you. Instead we are stuck with @SenToomey one of the worst senators!
what a shame @SenToomey did not listen to the voters he represents & go against a controversial DeVos, this wont be good for ed
Pence chged IN laws 
Charters don't have 2 meet same standards as Public bc student scores were so low in comparison
thanks for helping stop DeVos! She is bad for education
will be reviewing the vote of Betsy Devos. @KellyannePolls depending on vote I can help you in 2018. @BobLeahyJr
Thank you, Senator.
@kharyp @usedgov maybe work on Cotton, Hatch and Inhofe the ones she contributed the least to
@UniteBlue @usedgov I truly hope so.
@ginag63 @usedgov Keep making those phone calls to your Repuglican Senators!
everyone of them are bad for this country
Keep fighting! PA citizens support YOU and not @SenToomey on this issue.
and just how much money do u get from the teachers union mr. Casey? Keep in mind PA voted republican!!!
Thank You Senator!!! Keep searching for that 1 vote!! The future of children's right to learn is at stake!!!
tired of politicians who promise results but fail to produce them.DeVos not a politician;has given her life to helping children
@ImpactDemocracy Please try reeeeeeeeeeeally hard! Thank you!
, please convince your fellow senator @PatToomey to vote his conscience. My Pa. nephews deserve the best.
DeVos is a great pick. What are you afraid of..putting another 7 billion into education with no positive results?
can't wait to vote you out of office. All the working dems in phila hate you now
@frayed_nerves_ @usedgov I called my Senators. They're democrats and voting against the "Education Slayer".
@ImpactDemocracy @usedgov @thehill Sad you have to convince them of something they really already know.
#SaveOurCountry @ImpactDemocracy @usedgov
Thank you for your vote of no on #devos. My child and I thank you!
Senator Casey. As a PA voter, I fully support the appointment of Mrs DeVos to be Sec Ed. Waiting on her Confirmation.
BETSY DEVOS YES!!!!! AMERICA FOREVER!!!!! DOWN W/NSDPA!!!!!
I hope you lose your reelection bid for being a puppet
We hope you can find a crack in the wall and stop this danger to public education!  Thank you!!
Convince Toomey! PA residents phone & FAX him. Phone#s here: http://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=offices 
Mrs. DeVos clearly demonstrated her lack of qualifications for the job. Any other person who walked into a job interview so (1)
(2) I'll prepared would have been shown the door. If Mr. Trump wants to run America like a business, why is he not presenting
ualified applicants for the positions he is trying to fill?
Sorry for typos, but I'm not applying for Education Secretary. *ill-prepared *qualified
If @SenToomey and other senators have recieved donor cash from DeVos, shouldn't they have to recuse? #NoDeVos
thank you
How about getting my other senator, Toomey, to vote no with you and make Pennsylvania proud of both its senators?
keep fighting for us!
@SenToomey you want to get on board with your constituents? #noDevos
Go get em! I don't have a senator so I'm counting on you to be my voice. #DCstatehood #AdoptARep
@SenToomey has taken his phones in all his offices off the hook and all voicemail boxes are full.
TY for your efforts! DeVos is incompetent and dangerous for our children. What can we do to help? @SenToomey cant be reached
TY Many of us are contacting Sen. from other states since @SenToomey won't listen. She's simply unqualified.#noDevos
THANK YOU Senator!!!! Wish @SenToomey had a conscience. Smh.
please shut her down she's a freaking disaster
Her views on charters deeply problematic--unregulated gamble for families. Vouchers do nil to IMPROVE edu, deepens inequities.
thank you for fighting for us.  She is unqualified.
don't back down! Thanks for listening to your constituents!
please let @SenToomey that we Pennsylvanians don't want DeVos!! Hard to get our voices heard when he doesn't answer phones
, thank you Senator for representing your constituents & stating that you will vote no to DeVos!
@FontainePGH @usedgov she's our best chance to stop poor kids being stuck in failed schools to benefit big union.
@FontainePGH @usedgov I fully support Ms. Devos being confirmed as secretary of education.
highlights need for #DCstatehood to restore equal rights for DC citizens under ongoing JimCrow tyranny, to defend DC citizens.
Thank you Sen Casey from my 2 dyslexic children in public school
@ARosePozzi @usedgov Good luck senator Casey, and thanks for your efforts to protect public education!
maybe you could try and convince your colleague @SenToomey to listen to some of his voice mail and answer the fan phone!
I know you can convince them. We are behind you. #VoteNoDevos
thank you for opposing!
I think Senators in rural areas are more receptive coz their states can't accommodate lots of school choices #realPA
Keep it up...Charm them! #realPA
how can I help?
Tell Toomey that those of us calling, faxing & protesting are not paid.. he needs to listen
@SenToomey :Sen. Casey, tell Sen. Toomey 2 come out from hiding @ turn on his phone, constituents want 2 speak to him!
talk to you colleague Toomey, he's not taking my calls anymore!
Please fight hard! @BetsyDeVos showed the country how grossly incompetent she would be. Dangerous ideologue.
@ReadingPA @usedgov one time I have to agree, how can normal working people afford charter schools, fix public schools
Siding with teachers over students is why you'll lose Bob. Can't wait for your reelection!
Please vote NO to DeVos! We need a Sec. of Ed. with experience and who will help ALL children!
Keep fighting!!!
annnnnnnnnnd it will fail.
tell them the 65%  who voted against trump WILL REMEMBER them come Election Day!
# I'm Praying  Amen
thank you Senator Casey for your hard work
Thank you for all you do. The children of PA will benefit if DeVos' nomination fails. Please work on @SenToomey
Meanwhile, in other news, our Senators / Congressmen are approving an increase in Mil. Spending to Trump's War Machine
Our Senators / Congressmen are just Trump's lap dogs, sure they will approve Betsy DeVos.
@TuesdaysToomey @SenToomey PLEASE listen to your constituents and #DumpDevos #childrendeservebetter #Stepup #comeonyoucandoit
Thank you for opposing DeVos! Please work on @SenToomey and convince him to vote NO!
We are counting on you, Senator. Our kids are counting on you.
@thehill keep fighting the good fight Senator. I'm proud of your leadership.
@Sunnysgrl62 @usedgov Please keep fighting Senator Casey. DeVos is not an advocate for education
thank you for your no vote
@thehill This GOP wants you to convince any Republican to VOTE NO on DeVos!!!
Vote for Gorsuch in return???
Thank you for standing up for PA's families and teachers by voting against DeVos!
@MrSpock2017 @usedgov  Please help turn more Rs!!!! We know Collins and Murkowski will vote No... Children need NO on Devos!
I urge to think of children and support DeVos I pray your eyes will be open to truth
DORK -
EPA pick confirmed. You are losing. The crack is widening senator. Time to get on board before it is too late!
- talk to Toomey.  She cannot be confirmed!
I just contributed to your campaign - we will be here when they come after you in the midterms
Outraged -- @SenToomey is a weasel. See, Pennsylvanians, this is what happens when you vote for venal Republican party
.@SenBobCasey Despite the fact that I fully support her for @usedgov, this is a lesson on why you shouldn't have backed the nuclear option.
keep up the pressure and we will too! #resistdevros
As a constituent of PA & you being a Senator- do you not think it is highly unethical for @SenToomey to turn his phones off??
I can't believe this even has to be a debate. Start in PA. Citizens make that call #ToomeyVoteNoDevos
@ilovebillmaher @usedgov find one more. She is an abomination. She will kill Education.
Thank you, thank you, Senator Casey.
@SenToomey  Thank you Bob for listening to your constituents. #realPA
it is over bob. Get on the ship or drown in your useless battle. You are supposed to be helping fix our issues.
we will keep making phone calls. I believe that Betsy DeVos would be a disaster for Allentown school district
Thank you, Senator, for your work to protect public schools.  @SenBobCasey @usedgov
lease do it!!!!!
seems like you really need 2 to avoid pence breaking a tie. Please keep fighting!
you have been in office some time now. Schools aren't getting better. What are you doing to fix the problem?
@jimmyj48125 @usedgov I'll make calls and pray that @ least one other puts our country first before lining pockets
Thank you, me too!! 
@PADems @usedgov @SenateDems We need a full court press on this!  No on DeVos!
@thehill @robportman, please!
Can you suggest a Sen #GOP whome we could call and email blast?
don't let the union decide or bribe you
DeVos wants to give the responsibility of choosing how to educate children back to parents.  You disagree?
your a political hack who's only claim to fame is your last name. Can't wait to 2018 so Pa can really go red!
use the 30 hours of debate.  We cannot have someone as secretary of education who is so unqualified. #StopDeVos
get it done! You can convince them. You can do it!
what we need is for them to grow a spine and admit it. #CountryBeforeParty

@SenToomey @TheDemocrats Fight Fiercely, she is wrong for education and America
you need to work on @SenToomey He doesn't quite get it even though his office flooded w/calls to vote NO. Not listening!
I thought they voted for cloture. No?
thank you
How can I even consider voting for you in the next election if you are abandoning committee participation?
If they've been listening to their constituents, they would know the will of the people.  NO.
thank you Sen Casey.  Now if only @SenToomey would listen to the people he represents.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO PA VOTERS!!!! We will remember when it matters. #ToomeyCanYouHearMe
please go over to @SenToomey office and tell him #realPA wants him to vote no. He's ignoring/insulting us
tank you for voting for the education of my 
Grandson and others like him
@ChuckWendig @usedgov @thehill NO to DEVOS. Worst nominee ever.
@thehill you have our support...we aren't giving up and we are grateful you aren't either
liberal Dems have already lost labor to Trump,now you die politically with teachers union,don't care about edu of kids
@thehill @RandPaul @SenCapito @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorFischer @SenToomey @senrobportman @JerryMoran do the right thing!
Put country before party. Oppose Trump Bannon. Vote NO!
The focus should be about EDUCATION not a war between democrats and republicans! #DumpDevos
haven't you seen, it is about a war. Dems don't care who he nominates. They just want to cause trouble.
We will remember you at election time, thank you! I know I will be volunteering to work your campaign!!
@thehill do not use the debate floor, this has to be done in offices, on phones, in bathrooms, on elevators.
step1. get @SenToomey to turn his phones back on and stop lying about "paid protesters". We are his constituents in PA! #realPA
keep fighting the fight, Senator.
Thank you for keeping us informed, Senator. You are a rock star in trying times!
you've already convinced us that you're the wrong choice come voting time.
Please advise...how do we do this? We in PA are not able to reach Toomey so are contacting other Senators. What do you advise?
show up at elections and show your voice. Our senators are terrible. Both of them.
YES FOR BETSY DEVOS.  YES YES YES We need new blood, new thinking in the school system.
Thank you for standing up for the students of not only PA but the whole country and public education.
he isn't. The public school system is a mess and needs an overhaul. We don't want things to stay as before
your peers that have turned off their phones are doing a disservice to the people they represent. Flat out disrespectful
agreed.
serious question: hypothetically, if one Sen has shut down communications, who are the best proxies to use to reach him?
it's called votes at election time.
at the right and responsibility of the parents.
Therefore in a pluralistic society, which God permits for a time, education, is a private matter.
Wow....have you ever talked to a teacher?  That is not true at all.
It is not our choice, nor our preference.  You must know that. I would love to tell you about it.
I don't see it that way.
I think if more people like sat down and had a conversation, we'd find we have a lot of common ground.
You oppose her 4 using public funds while yourselves use public funds 4 education? (Rom.2:1)
Please tell us who is on the fence
Senator Casey, thank you so much for doing the right thing. We'll keep those calls up on our end too!
@SenToomey get on the stick gentlemen! Work together for our state please!
you're a failure. Go find a job and get off the US Taxpayer payroll.
We need a list of senators who voted for her.
please, continue to do your best. Please oppose this. Oppose this administration. Please unify the Dems and get dirty.
Money or concessions is likely the only thing @SenateGOP cares about.
Thank you! Education is too important to make rushed and impulsive decisions like this. #StopDeVos
vote for Devos!
are you serious? Public schools are a mess. They need to get cleaned up. Have you seen your taxes?
She will be voted in. But probably not Casey next time.  American schools next saved from Democrats.
@BrianMbsusa2 @usedgov Damn shame the witch is even considerd. Could not stand Amway weakass products.
It's over you Obstructionist Dems lose again. Try & get some real work done. You're out in 2 years
good luck!
Against better schools for Philadelphia? I don't want any of my tax money going there to bail out failing schools.
she cannot be given this position- I know she paid for it but she's not what education needs
