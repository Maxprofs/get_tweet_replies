@girlpowervoter @SenateMajLdr prime example why Congress approval rating is so low&worse 4crap GOP is peddling as better HC
they have bellowed for 7yrs the mistakes Dems did on ACA gave birth to TeaParty yet here we are
About to watch GOP double down on those mistakes with full knowledge of what they R about to do
to Americans Lifeline to affordable HC and they just don't give a DAM who it hurt
Republicans are voting at midnight on a bill they wrote at lunch and unveiled at 10 p.m. Most REPUBLICANS hope it never becomes law.
Same political party who said the 1 year timeline of Obamacare was written too quickly.
The same political party that said the over 100 Republican amendments in the final bill was "too partisan".
The common refrain that the "Democrats and Republicans are the same". Compare the process. Be critical.
IMPORTANT. CBO finds repeal bill will drive up premium 20% higher EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

Not just once. EVERY year.
This is sickening. It is unacceptable
And what is your response? @SenBobCasey #ProtectPatientsNow #ProtectOurCare
The "scene" was Obamacare.  Give Americans the same insurance the senators have and we will give YOU obamacare.
If @SenateMajLdr doesn't want to share the plan prior to the vote, the only solution is to vote it down!
What are we gonna do about all this winning?
Thank you for @SenBobCasey and the @SenateDems for fighting the good fight. We'll work even harder to vote the @GOP out in 2018. Believe it.
We don't have a government any more. Real Patriots better stand up to this. We WILL remember.
Nah. They'll wave the race card and their uninsured followers will flock to the polls to vote for them.
You obviously have GOP strategy figured out. It wouldn't work if there weren't racists who buy into it. Or r they actually creating racists?
Both
What the hell!
#VoteNO
#SaveACA
But it was ok for Nancy to say on Obama care that we have to pass it to see what's in it. Really  Bob?
Good grief
I'm embarrassed and appalled that @SenateMajLdr is connected to KY b/c he sure doesn't come out of his rabbit hole to listen to us.
This is un-American.
I concur!
Wow. Ridiculous
@SenBobCasey keep fighting!!  Thank-you
shameful behavior on full display in senate tonight. Senator Enzi is so disrespectful to his colleagues. How can Republicans justify this?
@GOP You all must be suicidal. That's the only answer.
Say no
Between bad Bannon imagery & this murderous trumpcare bill it will be a nightmarish night. Thanks @GOP
I like a clean break before bed. Baby sloths are great, .@Strange_Animals  and @MythPodcast are regular nightly resets for me 
All of America and all of Kentucky would like to tell him something. Shove It Up Your Ass.
Hey Bob, sure toss the word "scheme" around. How bout when you foisted Obamacare upon the unsuspecting people. Now that's a scheme dummy.
What? At 10pm?
Seems like the sane choice is to vote no. So we will see how many sane folks are in the senate.
Evidently there were only 3 sane R's.  THANKS @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain.  Thank you @SenBennetCO 

Screw @SenCoryGardner
@SenateDems @SenateGOP PLEASE VOTE NO! You MUST #SaveACA for the millions of ppl who NEED it!
YOU WORK FOR US!
STAND UP FOR YOUR PEOPLE!
Can't you offer amendments? That each need to be debated? And by rules doesn't bill get 20 hrs of debate? (Desperate to keep my healthcare!)
Thank you, Sen Casey, for fighting the good fight. We appreciate your hard work and for being a voice of reason
Vote no!
What is wrong with the Republican elected officials? Who owns your souls? #Enough
Then vote no!!!
We see you McConnell and we know what you're trying to do. Shame on you and your GOP boys club. You are not a leader.
Of course he is- it's all they can do to keep us from seeing this GARBAGE they're calling a healthcare bill
Keep us posted
What the FUCK is wrong with the #GOP? Not a single one of them should hold office after 2020. #SkinnyRepeal #Trumpcare #ClownCar
Dear God, that alone should tell @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins and the rest of @SenateGOP to #VOTEHELLNO! If you have the balls
Stop this betrayal of American families, seniors, women, and children!
This is outrageous. Keep fighting Senator!
Thank your for standing up for our kids, seniors n those with disabilities.  Vote no,  Senator Toomey, you have the courage to do that too?
@PaulBegala @SenateMajLdr So Mitch, when I lose my health insurance because I had cancer, can I give you a call for help?
He can get bent. He is responsible for EVERY! SINGLE! AMERICAN! who dies because they don't have healthcare. every yes vote is criminal
Unethical, unconscionable and irrational.
All political, not for us. Stop the madness. VOTE NO.  @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenDeanHeller @GrahamBlog @SenatorCollins
It's called the HCFU I believe.
Thank you Sen Casey! Stay strong for Americans who have no voice!
@SenRubioPress your constituents want you to vie this secret bill down.
No
A disgrace a free to die bill!!!
It's not a health care scheme. It's a health insurance scheme. None of this has anything to do with actual health care.
Yes. Let's all vote for a health care 'scheme'. What's the matter with you people?
GOP are crooks! Vote NO!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain You call yourselves public servants? DROP DEAD ALL OF YOU!
He's a BastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastardBastard
Tell him, go do the Bannon
This whole situation is sickening and abhorrent! 
Thank you for your NO vote.  You are PA's hope in the Senate since @SenToomey  is in POTUS's pocket.
What the holy hell has happened to our country?!?!  This congress repulsive.
unreal
It's 10:40 pm Eastern time. This is ridiculous.
A boll that is going to affect a whole lot of Americans and they don't want us to know what is in the bill, why?
Please vote NO!
Thanks for fighting for the people Senator.
This is so conniving!!! They are not working on our behalf, whatsoever. This political scenario has jumped the shark. It needs to go down!
I say let people vote on it.
I have a bill I'd like you to introduce: WHEREBY we agree that @SenMajLdr will henceforth be strapped to a rocket and launched into the sun.
I blame @SenToomey if it passes. You did everything you could and more to stop this. Thank you!
Happy we have you, toomey is a disgrace
He can't afford public comment. McC knows the public would/will eat him and IT alive.
@SenMikeLee You told your constituents you wouldn't vote for anything that was rushed or not transparent/well-discussed. Please vote no.
The unimaginable destruction of the @GOP, and the  ppl by @POTUS abetted by McConnell, @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP is underway.
I'm going to go all Mooch here and say what the fuck is going on in the Senate? Or is clown car a better description at this point?
Just say no
FFS
@senrobportman You best vote NO on this garbage.
Thank you for all you do Sen Casey! Thank God @SenateMajLdr isn't my Senator. He's conniving, dishonest and egotistical.
They are murderers. @SenateGOP
This is so wrong on so many levels!  They don't give a flying F*** what they are condemning people to!
Hell of a gig
This is deplorable.
Gotta be no

This is who the Republicans and Democrats have been for years. Get both parties away from power.
@SenateMajLdr -UNCONSCIONABLE! You are destroying our democracy!
Vote no save healthcare. Ty
That's absolutely absurd.
Succinct. True.
Reprehensible
I'm so tired of trying to keep the heartless, gutless @GOP from killing its own people.
Murderers gotta murder.
Call him on it. This malfeasance is conduct unbecoming of a U.S.Senator. What @SenateMajLdr leader has set in motion is un-American. Sad!
Senator McConnell: You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency,sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?
@SenBobCasey @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @SenWarren @SenSchumer stand strong! #protectourcare Americans lives depend on it.
Is that even legal?
At what point did we stop calling what the GOP is doing to millions of Americans murder. #BasicHumanRights #EmpathyIsAmerican
@leahmcelrath @SenateMajLdr Everyone has to vote No. This is not how laws are made.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for standing up for us. Not all senators are standing up for Americans. Some only care about party and power.
Then you know what to do. Vote NO!! If asked to vote on a bill "not publicly available," you vote NO!! It's what your constituents expect.
Stand up be a #trueamericanhero Like @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski

Vote yes and move it to house. Have to keep working on it - ACA unaffordable and few insurers left.
You should be ashamed Mr. Majority "Leader"
This is a disgrace
Lolol r.i.p. the terribly named "Affordable" Care Act. Maybe my premiums will finally go down.
McConnell changes the rule to suit his self His day will come He owns this all
This is the most cynical, disingenuous, odious, un-American garbage I've seen in my lifetime. #fixACA
Your country is insane. It's so sad.
Pull the fire alarm.
Shameful. No other words.
Disgraceful. On a sustained basis, @SenateMajLdr has done more to ruin the credibility of our government than anyone, even Trump#unAmerican
Say NOVote NOEnough
The @SenMajLdr is truly deplorable.
If Republicans that voted no before this and they are there don't vote no again! then there's no hope for America! BAD#BipartisanBipolarism
#BipartisanBipolarism we need Bipartisanship on Healthcare! Repair is the best options the alternatives are ridiculous!
#BipartisanBipolarism stop the back alley closed door run it down everyone's throats and let's get some true Bipartisanship working
Noooooooo
Are we even considered a democracy still?
Because the @SenateMajLdr is an ass clown.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for fighting for PA families. The Republican Senate is sinking to a new low.
wow what a shocking development nobody could have seen this coming when the motion to open debate was being voted on. 
@senateMajLdr has flipped imgone mad like crazy nuts get him to a hospital He is out of control!!
Fight back @SenBobCasey don't let those monsters destroy USA
McConnel is #1 hated politician in America, even over Trump. This bill will destroy him and all that are connected to him. Hatred grows
Screw this bullshit. This is what winners do? Irresponsible! I'm outraged!
Thanks for continuing to fight for the people. #disgraceful
@SenateMajLdr YOU own this. Shameful.
Wrath of MILLIONS will rain down upon ALL @GOP members if their families and friends suffer unnecessary pain, illness or #Death at your 
Senator if not publicly available that means no CBO score which means 61 votes needed, correct?
Snitch McConnell @SenateMajLdr is drunk on power.Stand up to him! thinks he's a tyrant. #McConnellKnew #TrumpRussia #PenceKnew #RyanKnew
Thank you Senator Casey for fighting for us.
@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan will never be forgotten or forgiven!
"I'm sure it's nothing nefarious." - No One Ever
@SenBobCasey How bout an immediate vote for change of Senate leadership?  He clearly doesn't have people's best interests in mind.
I suggest you vote NO or HELL NO to a bill you have no idea what's in it.
Criminal level negligence and malpractice by @GOP. Vote them all out in 2018! 7 years to craft an alternative and they failed. Pathetic.
@SenToomey how are you planning to vote & why? Please advise
Have you guys looked at what this White House is doing. Are you all crazy or senile.  Disgusting and a stinky house bill
This whole process has been a sham from the start. Mitch McConnell should be ashamed as should everyone who votes yes.
I'm disgusted
Hey KY voters. Does KY allow you to recall your Senator?  He clearly doesn't represent you and doesn't care about the rest of the nation.
How is anyone supposed to vote on something they've never seen? McConnell should be tossed out of the Senate for gross incompetence!
Why the rush?
I dont wanna that guy but all the democrats who thought it was better to vote for Stein, Trump, or chose to stay to home, this is on you too
With no hearings no CBO score all this just to say to deplorable base they repealed that black mans public health care policy #shame
Shite
McConell is leader in title only. No leader at all and way way beyond his best before date. Quite pathetic politician at this point
This is embarrassing. Imagine if Harry Reid tried this.
Too bad there are no more Repub Senators that have any courage @SenJohnMcCain or @LindseyGrahamSC or @DebFischerNE
RNs, MDs, parents, uh, ALL OF US, implore you to #VoteNO #NoTrumpCare
The @SenateMajLdr is anything but a leader.
Don't repeal and replace #ACA

They don't care about content 
Disgraceful
His politics are garbage and he should resign
Why do they bother? McConnell, Trump & Ryan should just rule by decree.
Is there not a single "Intelligent" @GOP  in DC? Seems they're all rats following the Pied Piper @SenateMajLdr
So, what can we do? How do the American people take our country back from these criminals? This isn't right.
The death of the senate by @SenMajLdr cc:@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
Thanks for keeping us informed Senator!
Diabolical man with power. @SenateMajLdr is stealing health of poor to pay for rich tax cuts.
15220/PA Resident/Voter/Constituent.Thank you, Sen. Casey!This GOP bill is NOT healthcare, not governing, not representation. Resist, Sir.TY
We've gotta ditch Mitch
@SenMajLdr you need to go back to the drawing board and get a better plan together- your so transparent! Why the rush Mitch?
McConnell needs to be thrown out. What a unbelievable jerk. GOP look like a bunch of  's
Not to their frenzied loonies who rather die of diseases than give brown black or tan people insurance.
I will never be able to look at a turtle again without thinking of that pos
.@SenateMajLdr needs to act more like a leader & less like game show host. "Do you want what's behind curtain 3? No you can't see it first"
It's the reality show-ization of the Senate.
Cross between a game show, reality show, and a telenovella.
Except the audience dies after it's over.
Continue fighting Senator, Please! This is just so damn terrible. Thank you for hard work!
Thank you, Senator, for keeping up the fight and talking sense into the few @GOP who actually want to serve American people.
y are they sneaky as fuck ??
FFS! #NOTNORMAL
Without a CBO score & giving time 4 congress 2 read it & seek public input? Isn't that breaking the rules? VOTE NO ON ALL GOP BILLS!
McConnell changing name on same horrible bill that majority of people do NOT want! @SenateDems @SenateGOP PLEASE VOTE NO! U MUST #SaveACA
Are we even in a democracy any more? That was rhetorical. Of course we are not. GOP will jam anything through for spite and kickbacks
MajLdr putting people's lives at stake to give tax breaks to the rich & because he hates Obama. Also hates the disabled? Shameful!! #voteNO.
Don't let them kill us!
There are no words to describe McConnell's total lack of integrity, honor & human feeling. Who knew Republican hate for America ran so deep?
VOTE. THE. GOP. OUT.
Thank you and shame on Mitch because this is all about Obama, not ACA they want to destroy everything, Obama. They do not care who they hurt
@SenateMajLdr is PURE EVIL
Vote no!!!
What about the CBO score?
Thank you for all your hard work. What has happened to our country ?
This is a disgrace.
What about the rule requiring at least 28 hours to read a bill before voting?
What rules? The rules are in the rearview mirror.
@SenateMajLdr is the devil!
@marcorubio nothing positive you do will overshadow the vote you take today...
