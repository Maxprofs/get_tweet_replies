Thank you Sen. Casey. We're counting on you to fight the good fight. Please convince Sen. Toomey to stand with you.
Please tell Toomey to open his phones & listen to the people of PA!!! We aren't going away. He serves us not DJT. Thanks.
Parochial school-educated teacher working in public PA schools (25 yrs): I thank you for working for ALL students! #DeVosFacts
I'm a 20+ year educator (public,private,charter)I have called, written, emailed, tweeted at every #GOP senator I can #noondevos
Please tell Sen Toomey to have his staff put the phone back in the hook here in Chester County so we can tell him #NotoDeVos
I have been faxing his office on a near daily basis for the past week.
Two senators funded by NEA not exactly bipartisan support ?
please vote NO on Betsy Devos!
- Thank you Senator Casey, you're kind of the only thing keeping a group of PA moms sane right now!
vote yes to #devos we do not need any school unions to keep crappy teachers employed. We need school choice and she will get it
@mrsloctastic Can you walk down to @SenToomey 's office and tell him to pick up the damn phone?
at least you voted for the people who will start wars and make life terrible for minorities, nice job there!
@SenToomey One of you is listening to your constituents re: Betsy DeVos. Hint: it's not you, Senator Toomey. #noDevos
gets o/national TV &  states they are paid; he can lie to rest of country/Pa citizens know better
that's because those elected officials owe the teachers union! Not about kids but protection of a broken system.
support DeVos!!!
Thank You!
Betsy DeVos will be great for education.
Reps need to address their BLIND FOLLOWING OF INCOMPETENCE DeVos expected to b confirmed. Shameful WASTE OF TAX $
let's not fix the lock on education by the unions. Hope and change is bad.
/just keep at it Senator!  We'll do our part!
I would LOVE to call but DC doesn't have representation be a #goodneighbor and give #dcstatehood
We want school choice, I'm in Pa.
thank you thank you senator Casey
what a relief she is not  qualified.
thank you for listening. Now we just need to have @SenToomey to listen to his constituents which he's been ignoring #DeVosvote
Please.  This is a morality war.  Will you be truthful or continue to peddle lies?   Don't you love your country? God sees all!
My relatives in PA are calling and can't get through?
#FIREDUP! We are doing our part to overwhelm them with our opposition. #noDevos #thinkofthechildren
Thank you for your encouraging words.
Please confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Tell the other Democrats to stop acting like Clowns, its disgraceful
stand with us.  We need you.
get rid of Devos!
?i m a little slow.  Are we still playing 'America is a democracy?' Its just not realistic enough to be fun anymore.
Thank you. Haren't been able to get through via phone to Toomey but have sent 3 emails to his office.
but then again I've never been represented in my state #assholes
about time someone woke up but unfortunately not any SC reps
the fact that you think two token votes from republicans is "bipartisan" is laughable and show how out of touch you are
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Casey!
PLEASE STOP BETSY DEVOS !!!
thank you
Thank you for being the one sane voice representing Pennsylvania in Washington.
thank you..please oppose all Koch Bros ALEC pawns, stop privatizing everything. We need gov't..privatization would be anarchy
Thank you for opposing the confirmation of Betsy DeVos!
please demand that @SenToomey disclose how many of us have been calling him in opposition to DeVos.
Thank you and thank God!  Our voices are being heard!  And we're not going away any time soon.
you lost my vote 2018
as well as bipartisan support. Keep in mind 2018 is closer than you think.
VOTE NO on DeVOS! Pls, please, please FIGHT 4 AMERICA. THE AMERICA WE LOVE! FIGHT TRUMP everyday & in every way that you can!
@Mooncatadams    PLEASE don't let trump policy, for putting people back-to-work by starting wars all over the globe & at home.
@MonroePaDems It's not over 'til the fat lady sings
lifelong Dem voted for Trump.  Dem behavior convincing me to vote Repub in 2018 PA senatorial election.
voting for Ms. DeVos is a big mistake that our children will pay for for gerenations to come!
she purchased her influence & knows nothing about education. Please block this inept woman.
#noDevos
Thank you!
bipartisan?  Who besides Collins and Murkowski? We need 3 minimally.
Please try to convince your fellow PA Sen!
who?? Corker just voiced his support of DeVos.
please do all in your power to block DeVos. She is inept- has purchased her way to the front. We deserve much better. #noDevos
@BernPress Devos should never be around our children. She is a disgrace to humanity
Thank you Senator Casey, from the children who need our voice!
Betty DeVos is unqualified to speak for our children. She was only nominated because she gave heavily to Trump's campaign.
If you need more reasons read this http://bit.ly/2kS2SlD  I am one of your state constituents NEPA Please don't let #DeVos in
@SenatorCarper Really, again you support an education system that does not work! Where does the USA rank in terms of STEM! Ugh!
Good to hear but I am disgusted her answers didn't cause full opposition! DeVos is the best GOP can do? #NoDeVos @inch2high
@SenatorCarper DeVos would be a FAIL for the country's children (i.e. Our future would be in doubt).
You and asso. need to show up for votes. This is sheer nonsense obstructing.Remember Obama said "We won" before.
understands the resistance. Other Democrats should follow his lead http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/2/1629092/-Sen-Bob-Casey-understands-the-resistance-Other-Democrats-should-follow-his-lead â€¦

Thank you for your hard work regarding DeVos nomination.

Thank you thank you! DeVos is completely the worst person for the job!!
please get Toomey in a headlock and make him listen.
@XO_LM @SenToomey won't answer his phones. Devos is not an appropriate choice for this position. Maybe SundaySchool?

We don't need the Federal Government running education. Should be up to each state
.@SenBobCasey @xplrer99 let's C if Toomy gets the message
I am embarrassed by our new government.  We must not tolerate Trump.
all of Toomeys voicemails are full. You might want to remind him his future is on the line.
Hope it'll make a difference on you when Bernie proposes the new bill for lowering cost of drugs from Big Pharma...we'll see.
We can hope. I mean, it is only our children/grandchildren's future depending on it. Do the right thing, Senators!
why is impossible to get through to Sen. Toomey?  Called every office and D.C. Can't even leave a message.
you had better talk to your rotten dem. senators who are asking on tv to continue the riots. Debbie W. Schultz had the
Please use your influence to get Senator Toomey to oppose her nomination.
.@SenBobCasey I hope you are passing along PA's sentiments to @SenToomey since he is refusing to answer phones or clear voicemail boxes.
We will keep fighting the good and honest fight
@slucyyy Thank you, Senator  #impeachment #SpeakRyanHasBetrayedUs

please ask your PA counterpart to answer his phones, listen to voicemail, open his doors to constituents. Where's @SenToomey?
please talk some sense into my other Senator from PA.  He doesn't take calls or anything anymore, doesn't want to hear us.
Do we need to pass it before we see whats in it?
@ManMet80 If she gets elected, she'll be the dumbest Edu Secretary ever. What DeVos would say to students about plagiarism 
@ZazuRules my senator @SenToddYoung is voting for her even though I have tweeted, emailed and called. 
I can't believe your attitude how childish no wonder the country is divided with this type of behavior Shame on you @SenToomey
unfortunately Sen Toomey seems to be supporting her. he is not listening to us. anything you can do?
@BernieDoesIt Dear God, I hope so, we need some good news!
@noreallyhowcome keep up the resistance
@Libby_Ball She is incompetent.
@kzoojbb This is not right!
Why isn't this trending???! #TrumpsAmerica #TrumpBan 
Unfortunately, @SenToomey is still focused on religiousity versus qualifications. TY for protecting PA children's education.
@AleciaWarrenXO she will be a disaster #noDevos #resist
