CONT: U KNOW THE GUY THAT NOBAMA WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE KILLED & NOBODY SEEN THE BODY, & SUPPOSEDLY THE BODY WAS DESTROYED, U KNOW THAT 1
Exactly what did it endanger Bobby?
Did NOT happen-explain why DEMOCRATS actively & nonstop undermining this admin no matter damage to nation.  Proves Dems haven't lost enough.
Congress needs 2 ACT IMMEDIATELY OR WE GO TO OUR REPRESENTATIVES @TheDemocrats & @gop &vote 2replace!!! https://twitter.com/owenbernard/status/864232512251469831 … #Indivisible
@SenJohnMcCain @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal the United States has been COMPROMISED https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/864224477693005826 … Who is protecting us... WHO??!!!

Pro-tip: We don't need members of Congress to tell us they're alarmed by Russians story. We're beyond that. What action will you take?
I will continue to support the PRESIDENT and do everything in my power to get you liars out of office!
A disgrace!!!!
Who's to say it was careless? We're you present at the meeting?
Yup tells me you're a leftist
Senator, when are you up for reelection?
Do you mean carelessness like that of your candidate Hillary Clinton, who had state secrets on the hacked bathroom server? Hypocrite!
"Carelessness"? Are you sure? How much more "careless" does @POTUS need to be before he is stopped? Keep the pressure on.
Someone should have told that to Hillary and her Bedouin Lover.
Trump is incompetent and is dangerous to many. His mental capacity and defiance is not something that a POTUS should continuously display.
TREASON HOLY SHIT DOESN'T THE UCMJ allow for him to be arrested?!?!
But,... but, her emails!
you doing anything about it other than tweeting? Why should I vote for you
Why don't the Republicans get off their dead asses and impeach Trump.  Surely they know something needs to be done.
Or there's more to the story than any of you know ~ethically speaking #DearMrPresident #DoKindness @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RoguePOTUSStaff
Sen Casey, have you also read this?
But "there was no intentional misconduct" and "no reasonable prosecutor" would bring charges.
Get that AH out of the WH once in for all! Senate must #impeach and protect America!
MORE FAKE NEWS!  DRAIN THE SWAMP!  VOTE CAREER POLITICIANS OUT!
But Hillary actually doing it is totally ok or something
WP is such a great source.
.@SenBobCasey @SenToomey @RepMeehan What are you going to do about Trump's idiotic conduct? IT'S ENDANGERING OUR REPUBLIC! #DoSomethingPlz
I thought carelessness is not a crime according to comey.
WHATS CARELESS IS SUPPOSED SMART PPL JUST TAKING LIBERAL PROGANDA AS TRUTH.  HEARD THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN IS STILL ALIVE.  CAN U GET IT N NEWS
Like Hill's unprotected email server?
how do you know this innocent until proven guilty asshole
He needs to be impeached
Hey Casey, the one thing that you do well is operate on rumor. You must get all your information from CNN
Call for impeachment -  our country's fate is at stake.
senator, please seek review of the full meeting transcripts and subpoena any tapes/recordings of the interaction.
Senator Casey. Don't let our egomaniacal president get away with it. Enough is enough.
Were you there?
“@realDonaldTrump’s carelessness w/classified information…” –@SenBobCasey
Does he have secret,unsecure servers in his bathroom or something?
Did you say the same on HRC emails that contained classified intel?
Impeach Trump
Impeach him!!
You are a god damn liar
Sadly predictable.
Seriously????? You still think you're qualified to run this country. #resign
You are a joke SENATOR. wow. And these calls for impeachment  lack one thing a crime or proof. The democrats are so hypocritical it's funny
please @SenBobCasey DO SOMETHING! I feel less safe as an American today than I did on and after 9/11! He's incapable of doing his job.
He's not as good at handling classified info as Hillary is, huh?
Bragging in the schoolyard. #impeach
Impeach Trump NOW, damn it!  Why wait until he does something worse?
Ya think?
Introduce Articles of Impeachment, let the GOP own their president
hahahahaha
No more excuses! #ImpeachTrump
Keep standing up for Senator Casey! We need you. Watching this is so scary! When will Republicans wake up and put country before party!!
Why is our senator lying and spreading known lies? Because that's what democrats do
What does our other wonderful PA senator have to say about all of this? @SenToomey
If this is true are there talks of impeaching him?
Rick Saccone 2018
#fakenews
You need to be careful tweeting false information @SenBobCasey. McMaster "the story that came out tonight as reported is FALSE"
I don't feel our country is safe with him as president.
He probably went to the Hiliary Clinton School of Confidentiality.
Impeach him now!
Time to impeach?
He is not going to let us find out stand up @RepMcSally @JeffFlake @
wait but you wanted someone to run for POTUS who had servers in her basement and sold our Uranium to Russia?
The Post Lies and u perpetuate it. You are complicit in lying to Americans to help your party's agenda. You are a TRAITOR!
dems have the "izes" disease..they dramatize, emotionalize, and sensationize everything
Hey Bobby just jump right in even though you have no idea about how deep it is. Irresponsible.
totally irresponsible of you.A .You don't have any facts to support it other than a news paper claim.B. you 're reinforcing rumor/lies . Sad
Time for Article 25 he is not fit!
Not to mention the lives of covert agents.
Yeah, WaPo. A reliable news source good one Bob.
Unfortunately he doesn't care
Our country is being sold to Russia piece by piece with every day Trump holds office. #ImpeachTrump
Casey made to look like a fool again.  Pro tip:  don't quote Wash Post quoting unnamed sources.  You chump.
He is an extreme risk to our security!  Impeach him NOW!
The question is @SenBobCasey , what are you and the Dems going to do about it? Do something, anything. This is too dangerous to continue
Senator Casey do not let this go lightly.  Stand against incompetency.
The details had not even been shared with American allies, and the disclosure could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.
Senator Casey, it is up to you and your colleagues to appeal to men across the aisle brave enough to fight for our country's safety.
Enough is enough. #ImpeachTrump
Thank you for maintaining common sense in PA's representation.  Now, DO something.  #25thAmendment  #EnoughIsEnough
Still unhinged over Hillary's loss.  Good thing your not stuck with obamacare.  Pa will send you to an early retirement in '18.
This is getting really scary, Senator. Is this not high crimes? This ignorant clown hollered "lock her up" every chance he got. Karma's a b.
What gall, Sen. Casey! After what your party & its candidate have perpetrated on the American people, now you speak? You're a fraud. Resign
Goodbye Troll. BLOCK
It's not carelessness; it's a small man trying to act like the big man in front of Putin's boys; this is typical behavior for Trump.
Sen Casey, why so timid in your rebuke? Are the representatives and senators traitors to this country? Why such APATHY!!!!
Scary to think this may not be the first time he has done this.
OMG lock him up lock him up lock him up
@OnlyRealFred @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost -Given Trump's relationship with Russia, the word "careless" seems 2 understated
If this is not classified as HIGH CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, and IMPEACHABLE, I don't know what is
Boom! Nice try Hackjob Bob! I will trust McMaster's word over @washingtonpost any day!
And McMaster just lied his ass off.
TAKE HIM DOWN.
Are you taking about Hillary's server? Clearly that was illegal and had classified information on it.
Come on now Senator...enough! Our country is counting on you!
Senator, that's bc he's a traitor. Why aren't any of u trying to save the country? He's committed 99 offenses! Do something!
You got any Republicans on the impeachment train with you yet?
Enough with the word play. Careless went out the door on election night. This is treason and it's time it is handled that way
If I were you I'd gather more "facts" before releasing a statement
Nothing illegal - technically.  @realDonaldTrump is destroying our safety and must be impeached.
Please investigate the White House treason!
Damn
Impeach!!!!
Like I said before, Trump is making a fool of you and we're loving every minute of it.
enjoy  yourself being sold to the Russian you all Trump's supporters
We see you, Troll. Now BLOCK
“Trump seems...very reckless...doesn’t grasp the gravity of the things he’s dealing with...intelligence and national security."
This has become unreal. 

@SenToomey, PLEASE support an independent commission & prosecutor. It feels like my government is out of control!
At what point is someone in the government going to step up and begin the impeachment process? When is enough enough??
Any Legislative Branch elected official who ignores this #CriminalClassifiedLeak isn't fulfilling their oath to #DefendTheConstitution
If you could all get together and impeach him before we all die that would be great
There is only one answer: #IMPEACH
He wants to play with the big boys, but he's still shitting the bed every night like the toddler he is. AMERICA IS THE BED.
@SenBobCasey Appreciate you condemning this but action must be taken, we're way past just words now.
Ego over country. Time to impeach.
@SpeakerRyan *unless they are a barely sentient being with an orange block of stone on its neck.  #paulryanhumancentipede
he is unfit
This isn't carelessness. WTF. Kislyak is a KNOWN RUSSIAN SPY. He should be arrested.
wow
Trump is a danger to our democracy he needs to be removed
I don't know what's going to allow rural PA to see the horrible reality of this stupid, STUPID orange man they helped get elected.
Update-How many docs in that server marked "Highly Classified" & too sensitive for allies? How many were handed personally to adversary rep?
As far as we know, all of them...to multiple recipients. Bad. Very bad.
Update: Go back & review - as I have - and you will find the most secure classification any is 'Classified' and those were *afterwards*
Please Senator Casey, speak up for what needs to be done. You know it and so do all of us. #ImpeachTrumpNow
What will it take for the Republicans to do something about this insanity?
Is this enough to remove him?
@ChuckGrassley @sengraham2016 What are Senate Republicans doing about this? This has to be the final straw in a string of transgressions
Impeach now!
When will Congress begin impeachment?  How much damage to our country will occur before he is stopped?
Senator, we've had enough. Begin impeachment proceedings.
How does this not make the GOP angry?
And we're letting this so called president to go to foreign countries. Congress wake up. Your life is at stake also.
RUSSIA MOLE!!!!
Not careless...could be DELIBERATE!!!
Senator Casey is anyone else other than the Dem's worried about this? Seriously, this can't be party over country. None of this is amusing.
@SenToomey Unfit for office! @realDonaldTrump must go.
please impeach him uncle bob
IMPEACH! WE BEG YOU!!
Is this not an impeachable offence??? What is everyone waiting for??  For him to shred this country??
@POTUS's security clearance must be revoked immediately and permanently!!! He is a danger to the US!
If the @SenateGOP does not get on board now! This is a disclosure to the same country that attacked us!
Impeach now!
Impeach this fool.
Please try to talk some sense into @SenToomey. His faith in @realDonaldTrump is misplaced and dangerous. #TrumpRussia #CountryOverParty
Impeach
Never assume malice when narcissism will suffice, aka Trumps razor.
WOW!
