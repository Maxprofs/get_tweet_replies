The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!
I keep hearing phrase 'Fake News' - can Trump please explain what news reported about about him is considered fake.
Trump needs to create an enemy to distract from his horrible "leadership."
@owelor02 can u sponsor a bill that somehow orders a psych evaluation on the POTUS? Package it with gun rights or something?
we have a @POTUS citing false terror attacks & when press calls him on error @realDonaldTrump yells "FAKE NEWS" #crazytrain
@Honey17011 Senator Casey, as a born, raised, still residing in Pennsylvanian, I can't express how grateful I m 2 see ur tweet
If news ppl did their job honesty, maybe we could respect them.
More than the Repub agenda, this is THE scariest aspect of this presidency. Freedom of the press essential to USA.
Free Press is now owned press. Go Trump
@realDonaldTrump fake news=doesn't agree with trump or push trump agenda? I call that objective and informative
well Bobby, when the MSM pushes stories such as the NG rounding up criminal illegals, what should we think?
NO ONE IS FALLING FOR IT. We The People support FREE PRESS.
free press always
substitute @breitbart @hannity @newtgingrich for @nytimes etc and I would agree with him
just add them to the list
If liberals didn't have Alynsky what would you all follow?
The Bloviator in Chief seems to have a talent for undermining our Constitution at every turn. Thank you for your needed stand.
since when is BS news a constitutional principal. There are very few real journalist out there.
@Honey17011 Trump shows his disrespect to his base by telling lies his uneducated followers will believe.  Like Limbaugh does.
they are they paint the picture they are told to paint been that way since the beginning of time
Rick Saccone 2018
Is sedition protected speech? Pennsylvania when Republican in 2016. Do you think it could go Republican in 2018?
protecting the media against Propaganda Communism Treason Dictatorship Hate groups & Cult's. Protects America & it's people GBA
untrue. The media has been pushing an agenda against the American way of life for years.
thank you, Senator. You continue to make us Pennsylvanians proud. Onward and upward!
you're right. The real enemies are ones like you that take Pharma money then vote to help them keep their insane profits!
@Honeyschil What constitutional principles aren't being undermined by this GOP WH?
it's not free Press anymore. It's owned propaganda.
@devislaskar that is what dictators do and this is Trumps platform.
Senator, I want to thank you for your leadership and representation of us in these unbelievably bizarre times!
Sen McCain correct -restricted press breeds dictators
thanks for fighting for your people, On twitter....
bob bob bob u ain't gonna be prez ..
@orangepussygrab @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN - He says things like that because he doesn't know anything
@realDonaldTrump No it doesn't Scranton Bob!You and your establishment bloodsuckers undermine constitutional principles!
No, they are lying to the people. Why aren't you more concerned about the outright lies told? #redstate #2018 @SenToomey
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC we are under siege!!
@Honey17011 Then the Senate needs to do something to protect "we the people" from this mad man.
@Honey17011 Tell it on the floor, Senator.
@Honey17011 DJT wouldn't know that since he's never actually read the constitution.
TY, Senator, Old Ivory in Pennsyltucky.
thank you for being a voice of reason during this madness!
Let me know when he starts tapping journalist's phones.  Calling out MSM bias doesn't threaten the Constitution.
haha! More #fakenews It's not the free press it's the biased press that's "the enemy of the American people "
PLEASE GET SERIOUS!! MEDIA ONLY REPORTS WHAT YOU & YOUR CRONIES SAY!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Everything about him & Repub admin is wrong.
I don't understand why Trump supporters want to live in a country without the 1st Am. Do they want to live in a dictatorship?
@JenniferOBryant they are the enemy of they are airing  fake news!! Period.. not diff
It's not FREE press anymore but rather, the propaganda arm of [a particular] political party. Became glaringly apparent in 2016
He is right.
.@SenBobCasey @JJohnson2u no question whose side you're on. Don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out
MSM is propaganda slanted left which is ideology against American culture,why call it free press?is there a press that's not?
@LehighCourts Ok for libs ie Pelosi  etc to call people derogatory names over the years. Outrage ?
,,, keep up the fight
North Korea comes to mind.
Thank you for acknowledging this. But now our elected officials need to hold 45 ACCOUNTABLE on our & Democracy's behalf.
Sorry Bob. The media has sunk to nothing more than liberal minions so biased as to be rendered useless as a free press
how were they undermined? Were they censored? Arrested? They still speak #FakeOutrage
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN when news manipulates TRUTH to get u to believe what "they" want u2 they ARE
He's absolutely delusional. And the @GOP is remaining mostly silent. He's their distraction from their evil agenda.
Not only is the media the enemy, but so is the democrat party and some republicans
They have been an extension of the Democrat party since racist Woodrow Wilson
@POTUS @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SpeakerRyan @MitchMcConell @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump
@mochameo @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews #Of course he didn't mention his private news station#Fox news whohis ass
@mochameo @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews #Trump is the dumbest person alive
Fake media are just like commercials. Trying to build up markets for themselves while telling lies to American people.
and his list is getting longer.
- not when you are speaking the truth.  The media is responsible for the labeling.  They earned it
DJT is an embarrassment to the USA
The enemy of my enemy is my friend!
what undermines the constitution are politicians that are not concerned for the American people but only for them selves
May I repeat, Mr President , did you mean your Cabinet
Three cheers for @SenBobCasey, the only senator who really stands up for real Pennsylvanians
Are you saying the FAKE news is helpful to America???
The media is now ALL about advancing the Progressive agenda which means advancing lies and burying truth.
The so called free press, stopped doing their job years ago. THEY have undermined our constitutional principles by misreporting
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Every government must be curbed by a free press for the protection of rights and the Constitution
Stalin used the same phrase when talking about his opposition party.
not when the media is caught lying to the people. The only word for it is enemy.
NO Sen Casey. if the emperor is naked, someone needs to say so. Donald trump has the guts to point out thecibcious.  my pres!
*the obvious
We the people of this great open loving nation will fix this mess. We will come together in spite of him!
that statement reminds me of you-know-who in Germany. This is getting scary.
really bob...because in this election they were not able to convince voter's to the left...as I'm the previous 2
And how much risk to you ascribe intention and condemn *that* instead of #pablumtweet?
The real problem is the fake or pseudo president
Absolutely
if media misleads on important information I consider it my enemy. And the media does that ALL THE TIME! Plenty of examples!
To cause tension in a society through half-truths, creating fear is detrimental media is acting as an enemy 
@scottie_freeman @SenBobCasey
this happened. And history will make Nixon look like harder. Can't wait for the book in 2027.
The only people that will save us from this messare the press. Multiple factions, mosaic reporting, eventual true picture.
Please, go to the House and tell them to start working on impeachment.
maybe if they would be fair, balanced and truthful without their personal political opinions POTUS wouldn't call them out!
When the biased media lies about everything, they are my enemy. When they delegitmize the POTUS, they are enemies.
if they actually reported the news that's one thing, but it's their endless self-important  left wing, political commentary
When was your last mental health exam?
you must not know anything about the constitution
Bernie sanders called them a threat to our democracy same thing dummy
trump I 00% correct msm is propaganda of the globalist.  BTW pa hates yo u
Not only that, I'm pretty sure the free press is our best friend right about now.  Imagine if they didn't exist...
@1stFanofChicago Journalists should band together in a simultaneously broadcasted network event to stand up for press.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Political Activists with cameras are hardly the press
Continue showing how stupid you are. Best thing to MAGA.
Rick Saccone 2018
To protect and defend the constitution of the United States
@realDonaldTrump And to undermine our Constitutional principles would seem sorta like a high crime or something per Nixon.
Same words are used in France at the moment, before President Elections, when dubious affairs occur in the free press. Danger!
@timatad @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Dictators past & present have declared same! Dangerous rhetoric DT
Why hasn't impeachment started?  This potus is insane.
@nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN It is an insult to every citizen who has read the constitution/not @realDonaldTrump
Sir. We know. Please reply directly to the president on this and get republican senators to do the same. Stand up!
. Can't accept the truth?  Free Press would not be the enemy if they would tell the store LIKE IT IS, and not exagerate
If his cabinet does not impeach under the 25th amendment, then they should be considered enemies of the state.
which principle
This is NOT a partisan issue. It's got nothing to do with politics. The president cannot be seen as the only source of truth.
This should be directed at your colleagues across the aisle...the ones with the power to defend the constitution right now.
that is a power we all share so direct it multiple-directionally  as we all share responsibility in a democracy
Absolutely correct. But they are corporate, globalist shills like you. They are not the Free Press.
We need Republicans to start calling out his lies. See @PeterAlexander for an example how to do this.
Some have balls. @senjohnmccain & @ShepNewsTeam have called him out & get bashed for it. Hypocrisy
Nah, they're just #sorelosers
Well you can say @realDonaldTrump is a sore winner because he never stops whining
Trumps right again. You obstructionist Dems have them in your back pocket & still lose
Not sure of the attack on the media. Seems it was bc of them Flynn resigned He's shutting up those who spill secrets
Not only that.  It is also one of the dynamics that helped Hitler and his ilk establish the Third Reich.
ICE are Trump's brown shirts
thank you for fighting for transparency and decency!
then fix this trainwreck Mr. Senator!
it is when it's reporting is skewed to favor a political party
Thank you, sir. @SenBobCasey
well I blame yal for not holding him accountable for is language you have 45 talking down and degrading America
I AGREE!! LEAVE THE MEDIA ALONE
Thank you Senator.
