Russia is NOT our enemy... well at least not the enemy of God and Freedom.
#Putinspuppet I'm expecting congress to do something about this. Treason! @MaxineWaters
@BuildingBridg10 @realDonaldTrump it is, time for the senate to step up
@MSNBC @Lawrence I am so sick of Trump blaming previous Administration. #lies #trumpadministration #BadPeopleWithBadIntentions
we don't know the extent of his Russian connections. He MUST release his tax returns.
We live in scary times with an aspiring dictator in the oval office.  Thankful that you are fighting for us!
Trump cries foul, saying that the world has taken advantage of the US. (2)
because it's true
Please pursue this! For our safety!
trump has financial interests that come before his loyalty to the country.
@darlene913 @realDonaldTrump It's not confounding, it's obvious, and getting moreso. Investigate and impeach.
@Meemie24 @realDonaldTrump And Trump publicly asking Russians to hack Hill after they hacked DNC? Whole thing is outrageous!
do you know how to get in touch with @SenToomey office? They never answer the phones
and weak People who are worried about being PC are threatening are security.
@rosieburkie @realDonaldTrump what are you going to do about it?
stop being a zero .. be a hero... stop the obstruction help unite USA
very disturbing
please investigate ! I think theres plenty to find.
impeach him!
@jboogie_pdx @realDonaldTrump "Fascination" or "Bromance"?
that's a given. Question is what is being done about it.
.@SenBobCasey do something! Tweeting is not enough! Stop this madness now for our childrens' sake
Why do we hear so little about any investigation? Why isn't the House starting impeachment?
please, Sen Casey, work w House colleagues to begin impeachment. Has DT not yet done enough to justify?
Best to love your neighbors and make sure your guns are oiled and loaded.
What are you going to do about it?
the detriment to our national security sir was signed by the judge in Seattle
And you and Obama were a detriment to our security with your meaningless red lines in the sand
Bull shit Bob - You didn't bat an eye when Hillary sold Putin tons of uranium. @realDonaldTrump
@Kris_Sacrebleu @realDonaldTrump it's treason. Let's call it what it is and Investigate it.
this is a threat to the world.  Unacceptable before.  Impeach able now
so impeach him. I'm sure you can find a way.
See Trump interviews re Putin on my home post. At least,Trump owes Putin for coverup.Putin chose Pense and ..? If stay, VP won
13 & 15 Trump interviews say met & relationship wPutin. Proof sharing cover up of relationship and alliance pre-election.
why are u worrying about it. That's all u got? Repeal and replace Casey in 2018
@Kris_Sacrebleu @realDonaldTrump thank you Senator Casey, the American people definitely agree. Absolutely insane.
Ya, think? They HATE our government and SAID SO the whole time. What part did you not get?
I'd really love to volunteer for your 2020 campaign!
Dionald Trump is a threat to national security! Also his incessant tweeting compromises the integrity of our government! V. Bad
It does require investigation. You're dealing with a pathological liar in DT.
@darlene913 @realDonaldTrump Called treason there Bob, maybe get Comey in a select committee asap
his fascination with strong leadership? Rather he be fascinated with pandering shriveled progressives?
You and the rest of the world now know that @realDonaldTrump is a dangerously ignorant, reckless man #TrumpNotFitToServe
you're embarrassing yourself,stop being a political hack and start acting like a Senator that cares about us
I hope this Trump -Putin connection is being investigated.  I heard Kremlin gave money to DT's campaign.
PLEASE move on a bi-partisan investigation into #45's Russian ties  PLEASE
at least HE didn't sell the Russians OUR uranium rights. #Hillary Clinton State Dept.
what are you doing about it?
why keep this guy bottled up when you give interviews?  Your tweet stream is pure Fight and it's what the party needs.
keep fighting for a senator we need you now more than ever
@lizloganhere What are the Dems waiting for? So-called Pres is endangering the republic! This stage, demeaning the Judiciary.
This. Is. Not. Normal. Senator, constituent here. Please do everything in your power to stop this insanity.
We have to really look into what Putin did with our election. #fire_the_fool
@tresamused are you going to wait until he bombs Iran or China?
@tresamused that has bern true for a long time. Trump wants to be rich like an oligarch.
@lkproudliberal #ReVote election was stolen and invalid @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @SenateDems @JoyAnnReid
Yes sir. Well put!
@KimCamarato @realDonaldTrump You have to wonder how indebted he is to Putin. Maybe his tax returns would help.
look int #exxon #Tillerson & THUG PUTIN & $"BIGGLEY" $oil deal$ ! I think THUG PUTIN HAS #HEIR TRUMPS TAXES ! #PutinsPuppet
Thank you for speaking up Senator. Your voice is needed now more than ever.
Yea, Putins puppet- we need a select senate committee to investigate Russian election tampering
thank you for being sane
Do you have a plan to protect citizens from terrorists on our own soil?  3 Muslim bros breached democratic machine.  @POTUS
You gotta get Steve Bannon out of the White House and look into Trump's ties to Putin. #RESISTANCE
is right, @SenBobCasey. Get Bannon out. Nothing gets better until then.
Every aspect of the 2016 election is still suspect. Russia's full reach is still not known.
My Father & Grandfather, both Veterans, would be disgusted by his statement that we're no better than Russia. Unacceptable!
It  was ok 4  u guys  to be friends with  Iran & pay them  to kill  people in the world.. Do you have a life
IMPEACH!
Thank you Senator for leading on this. Your colleague needs reminded that we are #RealPA
Thank you for speaking up and please keep pushing on this. We don't want our beloved country turning into Russia!
Need to find out what russia has on him.
there is something in those tax returns..need legislation going forward..they know each other and are comrades
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN - The PUTIN Way
TRUMP say's America isn't Innocent - LOOK AT ME
- POTUS is a #NationalSecurityRisk
People have already died because of his incompetence! 

We're so screwed
there is absolutely no evidence that Putin had anything to do with it
