glad one of my Senators listens, thank you! Fail DeVos she can't pass the test!
Thank you. PA has at least one senator that is listening.  We will be there for you!
@BrendaLeeFree except they actually have to listen to constituents. Looking at you @SenToomey
doesn't answer his constituents calls
same in OK. They have no plans to listen.
THANK YOU senator Casey for listening to our stories and calls! We want to protect pup-lick schools!! I mean public schools!
have you personally spoken to @PatToomey @pattooabout #DumpDevos  ???
Public schools today haven't done their jobs; students suffer.  Y not try different approach?
. Public education worked well for pretty much everyone I know. Bad Parents are failing kids.
No way; schools in poor areas are doing worse, not parents.
Have you ever been in a "poor" area? I was poor, went to a "poor" "failing" public school, still managed two degrees.
U R very lucky
No - just good responsible parents that were involved.  Don't shift blame to schools and teachers when parents are absent.
make it @SenToomey!
Please keep working on them, Bob. I have been calling and writing everyone, even Trump.
@HelenGymAtLarge Together we can do anything! #NotoDeVos
I see you lost this so called fight..you got trumped again.
well @SenToomey shutoff his damn phone the last day or so. PREDICTION: he votes yes then puts out spineless statement about it.
Who is wavering/
Bob everyone of my pa... neighbors voted for trump..your out of touch..
thank you for all of your hard work during these difficult times!
@ccarneym Who best to target?
shameful lib. At work!
Thank you for your work Senator Casey .
: Thank you, Senator Casey! Can you please talk to @SenToomey sometime, btw? Lot of folks can't reach him for some reason.
We appreciate that but we need you to vote no on ALL Trump appointees. Disappointed to learn this was not the case. We need you
I left you several messages. I'm glad to see your voting against her. Thank you
@HelenGymAtLarge thank you!
Sessions must be blocked at any cost. We have been infiltrated by Russians. Impeach Now!

Estonian?  You are fake!
nice argument my son has to defend people lives like you is sad
Foreign and Domestic. I took that oath, I plan to keep it.
I am sorry you are so bitter god protect you
Maybe your son is in my unit. What's his name?
Rather not give info on him on here to many haters.
@JulieEhlers  not that anyone will get thru to a human, but call P Toomey all damn day if you have to (202) 224-4254  No DeVos
I have been and so has everyone I know!
@SenToomey  Dude AND his staff are ghost. Called 37 times yesterday to remind No DeVos
Thank you sir, you're a hero of our state
pa is a trump state..remember.
.@SenBobCasey, translation: call @PatToomey now!
please work on toomey. Call his local abd dc office daily. Can not get thru #TheResistance
it's sad that Pat Toomey is not taking our calls hearing our pleas to block this nomination
so proud of your work for Pennsylvania and America
Where is @SenToomey on this?!
couldn't get through any number listed for @SenToomey!!!!!! It's either busy or full mailbox
Heard @SenToomey offices are not answering calls anymore. #VoteNoDevos
So Senator you want to deny inner city parents the right to send their children to Charter Schools. Priceless.
you are ridiculous
Who do we call? Who is most likely to listen? Can't get through to Toomey. Who else is known to be on the fence?
have you been in contact with Sen Toomey? It's been impossible to contact him as a constituent. Very concerning #noDevos
God Bless you
@Pie_SocialMedia yay!!!
Thanks for transparency and being there for the people of PA.
Have you spoken to your colleague, Mr. Toomey? He hasn't been very available to constituents.
@Kat4Obama Yes!
stop the sugar daddies teachers unions - give the middle class school choice
thank you for taking the calls from your constituents and for voting against DeVos. @SenToomey we expect same from u
Your buddy @SenToomey has the phones off the hook, pretty sure.
we can't get through to @SenToomey v. frustrating
thank you, senator
Keep fighting!
you mean you can't get through to toomey either?
Thank for your support of public education!!!
@womensmarch We're on it, Sen.
@womensmarch Thank you Senator Casey
@NoTrumpJewel thank you from across the water in the UK for everything your doing.
who is still on the fence? Who should we call?
Can't get through to your colleague @SenToomey. Give him a message for me? "Vote NO on DeVos!" Thank you!
How unethical the left are. Narrow minded Hypocritical people are entirely the problem. #getoveryourself You wrk 4 the people.
why are you so afraid of someone who wants to make our schools better vote Yes for her
@TuQuoque7 Verified GOP event at Drexelhood. Invitation via @wheresPatToomey not verified. @PatToomey not responsive all day.
WTH? He was JUST re-elected, out filling coffers so early? #StopDeVos
since @SenToomey won't answer can your staff pass our messages to him and his staff?
well there's no hope in @SenToomey thanks to his campaign contributions from DeVos. Which GOP senators hasn't she bought?
Do what you must to ensure this nominee us denied the Ed position, and save our schools.
Keep after it Senator!!!!
Too bad your counterpart @SenToomey isn't getting the message... so much for that promise of a backbone.
: Yeah, how about blocking this? #StakesHigher

"Senate has voted to let mining companies release toxins into streams & rivers"
Thank you for voting no on DeVos. Too bad no one has been able to reach even voicemail box at any of Toomey's offices for days
still for someone else time.
Your colleague @SenToomey fails to answer calls at any office, no faxes accepted. Coward is hiding.
It's time for you to start working for your constituents rather than against us.
Pleeeeeease, Senator Casey... plead with your colleague, Sen. Toomey. Take him out for a beer; send me the bill.
YES BUT @SenToomey wonâ€™t BUDGE! Will senators listen folks from OTHER STATES?
@RTRustBelt Has anyone seen or heard from @SenToomey ?
@_Hope2017 Please call your representative before the end of the day! Protect our kids future 
thank you for your dedication.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am proud to call you my Senator. We'll continue to fight with you.
who are you working on, who specifically should we call? Toomey
 is my other senator SCREAM
Too bad Senator Toomey doesn't answer the phone at any of his SIX offices!
@womensmarch Please join me in demanding Senator Toomey release how many of his constituents have asked him to vote no on Devos
GOOD AFTERNOON Mr SENATOR .
if Toomey would unclog his phone we would could give him a call!
Who do we call to get DT out of office?
Senator Casey, how is your art/science of persuasion?
Hard to fathom any others breaking ranks, @SenBobCasey. The Emperor has spoken. #partyoverprinciple #TheRepublicanWay #smh
Thank you for your service, sir.
call Pat Toomey!  Yes he took money from DeVos. Tell him to show some integrity for once in his life!
I'm not impressed with Democrats blocking one nominee and pretending that's a victory. #BetsyDeVos
Tell Toomey to quit being a fuckstick then
can we out McConnell too?
FROM OHIO. I can't get even a response back from Rob Portman after many calls an emails. I will never vote republican again.
Could you ask your buddy, @SenToomey to answer the phone or at least listen to his voicemails?
we also need YOU to stop voting for Trump nominees too though. You've voted for 3, only against 2
maybe you should call @SenToomey since no one else seems to be able to get through to a person #busysignals
Have fun storming the castle.
How do we convince  Senator Toomey to vote against? #blockdevos
Thank you!
@ClaraJeffery I fear we are being played by the #GOP. Give us 2 ppl just to get our hopes up only 2 B demoralized
please talk to Toomey!!!
I'm glad you listen to us PA constituents.  I can't seem to reach @SenToomey.  It's like he's afraid to hear the people.
Please tell Senator Toomey to clear his voice mail inbox. His constituents have been trying to reach him to tell him #NoDeVos
Please go down the hall & see @SenToomey  You should remind him he works for his constituents and not @BetsyDeVos #VoteNoDevos
I wish @SenToomey would clear his voicemail so we could get through!
have you spoken to @SenToomey?
who do you recommend DC residents call?
every KEEP CALLING @SenToomey I got through yesterday and today at Allentown office.
thank you for caring!
ty Sir, we will not forget your dedication of this on Election Day @SenToomey however I will vote NO to you on Election Day!!!
Iemailed Toomey.hope he listens to us..it's our decision, not his. OUR children and grandchildren affected. Thank you, Senator!
Vote YES on BETSY
perhaps you can get @SenToomey on board with those NO votes. Please!!! Thanks for your vigilance and for listening to us!!!!
bob, keep building those walls and you will be out of a job in 2 years. Also now you can't lobby either. What will you do then?
Thank you, Senator. A few of us PA residents have tried contacting your colleague @SenToomey but he is MIA?  #noDevos
thank you for standing up! We will remember. #StopDeVos
Yes, we're all so proud of you. Enjoy your last two years in the Senate.
Could do us a favor and walk over to @SenToomey office and ask him start answering his phone ... please?
On behalf of PA voters (and country), thank you! PS, has someone put out an APB to find your colleague @SenToomey?
Thank you, Senator.
We love you but where is the other PA Sen?
Mailbox full for weeks.  Poster not mine but great.
thank you for all your hard work! @SenToomey and you should be a united force for PA!
thanks Sen Casey! We'll keep calling Toomey to get all of PA on board!
@BenSasse @SenatorFischer We are watching your vote. Pls vote for what's best for your constituents & vote no on DeVos!!
Thank you Senator! I've reached out to your colleague across the aisle. I hope @SenToomey will do the right thing too! #NoDeVos
Just found out ROB PORTMAN FROM OHIO IS VOTING YES FOR DEVOS.
also it would be great if your followers and constituents saw the best way to get in touch by fax https://faxzero.com/fax_senate/75 
I called @SenToomey office today and requested he block DeVos.
can you tell @SenToomey to get his phones working. Thank you. A worried Pennsylvanian
This man is being an obstructionist and is trying to sabotage Betsy DeVos RT call Casey tell him to do his job
You are right what a bunch sore losers
not Toomey that's for sure.  Other states are trying
bob. have you seen senator toomey? no ones answering at his office. wondering if you could swing by
He working not setting office an stalling
Whom should we lean on?  :)
that's my question. Like who's wavering?
standing up for Americans Education. Thanks
PA has some of best school districts in the US...DeVos would undermine them bigtime. This is what @SenToomey doesn't get
Can you talk to your PA peer @SenToomey for us? We can't get through!
@OhWowHmm Use email on his website too. Emails are sorted as Yes & No piles.
I was able to get through to a @SenToomey staffer on the toll-free number to the Bethlehem office today. (855) 552-1831
