just like the wall you build around the truth of pewdiepie
Apparently can't understand asymmetric warfare, sixteen years later.  At least they're making it easy to identify the problem children.
I hear intelligence reports are fake news, the enemy of the people. #SoCalledPOTUS #TrumpLies #RussianPuppet #traitor #USA #resist
Not sure why all the uproar, if vetting more rigorous than needed, all to the good. Nothing to get all in a sweat over.
@SenBobCasey   Your New World Order is OVER!!!  You lost.  The people are rising up, 1%.  We are going to shit in your 100 year bunkers
How long before thin skinned tRump bars WSJ from WH briefings as well?
WTF is wrong with you @POTUS?  These guys actually know what they are talking about.  Maybe you should listen for once.
#HypoFritz
Fire Ben Fritz for being a hypocrite or do you not care about racism when its your own journo #IStandWithPewds

One madman listening to the perpetual shit being given out daily by the media.  Could end up destroying the entire earth.
Breaking news: WSJ full of fake news and racist tweets by a certain reporter hack...we're looking at you @benfritz #HypoFritz
How many Trump supporters still do so because they won't admit they were wrong and that so is he
fking corrupted media
guess Obama and congress had it wrong then, right?
he made that list for people to require visas, not for a ban. That's quite a difference.
Report conflicts with Trump's Nazi like attack on immigrants incountry & needs to STOP causing fear among innocents!
better get behind Pres. Trump or your career will be over. how do you feel with your NEW SOCIALIZED DEM. PARTY???
like a body rejects a new , or in this case, brain. Doesn't know what's good for him.
You missed the point. The main issue is that these 7 countries lack a coherent central govt that can provide info on their citizens.
@SpeakerRyan When will you step up?
#FakeNews
Apparently @realDonaldTrump wants old information that correlates w his weak ban which increased vetting was based on under #Obama
this paper became a lot better since it switched to genuine National Socialism.
Then the report LACKS intelligence and is made up by the left over FILTH of the barry obozo regime.
@SenBobCasey. I so want a country like Sweden, Germany or France, NOT.I also don't want to be raped, beat or killed because I am female
Really?  It's not immigrants, but the dangerous ones, which is WH position. Slanting the narrative again. You think readers don't see?
How dare the intelligence community not agree with Trump.  Surely they understand that Trump is never wrong.
The headline should be @realDonaldTrump rejects intelligence.  Period.
Wasn't it the Obama WH that said these seven countries were dangerous?  Of course.
why do nazi groups have wsj fan sites #fakenews #wsj #nazi
WSJ = Fake asf
You need some serious restructuring. You have editors, not journalists.
C O N T E X T
Breaking: WSJ stands by journalist @benfritz following tasteless anti-Semitic twitter posts. #hypofritz #firebenfritz
Thanks to Intel community for speaking truth to power!
Name your sources!!!!
#FailingBusiness #fakenews #FakeStreamMedia

Fire @benfritz for his racist tweets! #Hypofritz
#hypofritz fire @benfritz right now. Do it. JUST. DO. IT.
worst thing you ever heard it says it gets information from the public sources what a joke and you wonder why people call you fake
Breaking : Media report ignoring risk of following ethical journalism in smear campaigns #HypoFritz
how about reading the freaking article before commenting?
who gives a rat' ass. We do not need any immigrants or refugees from these countries. How does it benefit the US not a charity!
Trump is the greatest terrorist and enemy of the people of this great nation
yes!!!
Their citizens pose no danger ..go visit , have a great time. Jihadist are not enemies of the state over there.
Make friends with them
Et tu, @WSJ?
why no? this is our country and it is our right.
dam you nazis
Of course 45* rejects it. It doesn't fit his narrative, doesn't stroke his ego.
protesting is not illegal, but protected under free speech...you probably learned that in the 3rd grade.
fake news
bad headline again. Let me help you "shows integrity of Homeland Security Dept" #fakenews #resist
Meanwhile, at the Halls of Justice...
your "report" quotes the DHS spksprsn calling the info "commentary" so why does WSJ call this a report...so disingenuous..cut it out!!!
apparently homeland security hasn't been listening to the soldiers who have been there
not an honest story - - story is unhappy dems continues to leak classified info putting their country at risk for politics. print that
I guess the Department of Homeland Security is "fake news" now too? #trumpisajoke
did you read it and then you wonder why people think it could be fake better wake up
@realDonaldTrump rejects everyone and everything that disagrees with him. And then calls them names and threatens lawsuits. Bully! Sad!
USA economy was left in ruins. Mass illegal and migrant entry is madness at this time. Economy set to crash.
That's right boys and girls counties that harbor terrorist training camps report jihadists..yeah right
I've dealt with Intel like that. When we got back I beat the company man's ass
#ISTANDWITHPEWDIEPIE #GETSEASON2OFSCAREPDPBACK " #IStandWithPewDiePie
when will the congress @SpeakerRyan see that shit has hit the fan.
"Donald Trump Rejects Intelligence"
and you?, where is your intelligence?
#fakenews comes from all sources. WSJ needs to be more critical of what it presents as news. Studies by biased sources! Good grief!
Please apologize about the pewdiepie situation
this is what @realDonaldTrump asked for!! He wanted their piece of mind. #truthhurts
#russiagate #russiagate #russiagate #russiagate #russiagate it's all about Russia. Keep your eye on the ball.
Did WSJ bother to find out who authored the report? Was it Dems and Obama remnants? Makes a difference.
I'd be surprised if they didn't. WSJ is a good, conservative paper.
Not to mention, they hold the prestigious honor having the Daily Stormer be their #1 fan site!
Has @realDonaldTrump ever been right about anything? Ever?
did you read past the misleading headline?
Can you read? Your question is irrelevant.
Yes.  And I did.
Don’t (RUSSIA) other issues (RUSSIA) issue distract you (RUSSIA) from (RUSSIA) Trump’s ties to Russia. (RUSSIA!) #TrumpRussia
Trump is the only terrorist we need to worry about
When will congress put this administration out of it's misery?
OK with the Nazis in the WH though?
