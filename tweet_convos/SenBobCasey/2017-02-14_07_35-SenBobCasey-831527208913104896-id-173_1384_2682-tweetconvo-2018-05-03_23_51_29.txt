Rep Jason Chaffetz R-UT tells reporters there's no need to further probe Flynn.  "It’s taking care of itself"
Thank you, Senator Casey - from a constituent. We need strong voices demanding a full investigation. This is unprecedented.
Keep working hard for us! Thank you for representing the people of Pennsylvania!
He is?  So far he's voted for a totally unqualified Secretary of Education.
good point William, he is much better than Toomey
hmm ... good be.
you know he voted no to De Vos?
well that helps, but was not my understanding.  I look into it.
@newyorktimes110 posted a list of the YES and NOs and every dem voted no
time to launch an investigation on Jason Chaffetz @jasoninthehouse . #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachPence #FireChaffetz #DoYourJob
He pounced on Benghazi investigations train with even less facts that this time. No rational reason not to now.
@GreenPeaches2 ~O no it's not!
@jamiedupree Utah voters love their little Jason and his hypocrisy.
thank you. For when we pivot to pence....
@Patbagley maybe we need to investigate @jasoninthehouse's personal role in this. What's he hiding?
thank you Senator Casey for truly representing us .
@MsDMcLaughlin let's INVESTIGATE #IranDEAL
thank you !  Need independent investigation.  Wake up @SenToomey I think he's asleep or hiding.
.@SenBobCasey @OverUnderClover Is @jasoninthehouse just a partisan hack or is something more at play?
@Dr_of_Nursing @jamiedupree Folks in Utah need to make this coward pay in the mid terms and MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD NOW
NO IT'S NOT OVER NOW UNTIL AMERICA KNOWS THE TRUTH.
Yeah, it's taking care of itself. Rather like a suppurating wound.
Hey, Bob, I'm not a constituent but, "Attaboy!"
@Mgivens61
get over it
@mch7576 the cover up is taking care of itself...not the root cause
I'm citizen of this country and I demand an investigation
Doesnt look like it is taking care of itself to me.
@flippable_org You got to be kidding me @RepChaffetz. We the people are demanding for an investigation.  
DO YOUR JOB!
@SenToomey 

There is just one vitally important question: What does FBI Director Comey know? Why go after HRC not Trump/Flynn?
yes we must know!
@Gabbiedrice78K We need to keep reminding voters which Senators approved Flynn.
None did. NSC can be appointed solely on the President's decree.
Approved in the sense of agreement, not casting votes. Poor word choice. Apologies.
@jasoninthehouse is such a Dipshitz!
That's like saying no need to investigate the accident; all those involved died. Just sweep 'em up.
@MrClameron Thank you Senator Casey!
keep it up! It is not over! It is just beginning!!

@thepoliticalcat No NYT is taking care of it apparently!
@middleclasslass absolutely not enough.
Thank you for recognizing that Flynn's just the tip of the iceberg here. Appreciate your efforts!
I want to know if the entire election was a shame. And what do we do about it. This can not be allowed.
agree. It will not.
Thank you, Senator, for sticking to your guns about Flynn/Russia. Stonewalling is a bad sign, and we're seeing a lot of it.
The hell it is!
thank you!
@jasoninthehouse It's not over, do your job. Russian connections may go deeper. Country first, party second.
Assume the most extreme responses come from collaborators.
, @jasoninthehouse needs to listen to his constituents & #dohisjob
When leaks are more plans than vetted information, you need to open YOUR eyes. It was a setup by those who should be fired.
fight yell scream. Keep the pressure on
Man he is SUCH a little weasel.
Actually there are many more questions than answers and if the administration is so innocent then let an investigation happen
pls tell us Senator that there will be investigations regardless of R refusals & coverups for trump - democracy is at stake
I'd love to see the size of the rug they are trying to sweep everything under
please stay on top of this and demand further investigation.
@bleatstreet Let the Constitution be the judge of that.
@Shakestweetz @jamiedupree Every time anyone in house takes this stance, response is "You gotta be fucking kidding me!" #YGBFKM
Get out of our House @jasoninthehouse . You are not welcome there. You are a TRAITOR!
just called your office to say thank you. Going to say it here too. Thank you.
@db771 @jamiedupree 
He needs to DO HIS JOB!!!!
@jamiedupree we have to get the real dirt here for national security purposes. Tell Rep Chaffetz -Stop playing partisan politi
@Shakestweetz Let's sit Flynn in front of the country for twelve hours and give him the HRC treatment!
Thank you, Senator Casey! Do not let this drop! We must know what he did and who he talked to.
@Mrs_Grayeyes dope!
@Shakestweetz thank you it really isn't.
Bob, PLEASE don't give up on this. 
We all know that if POTUS had nothing to hide he would abide by full disclosure. Thank you!
I mean, it *will* take care of itself, but it's better if we don't have to wait until 2018.
@theshex @jamiedupree Thank you Senator! We demand a full independent investigation in all things Trump/Russia!
comey and chaffetz have been too complicit in this. WHY?
.@jasoninthehouse doesn't care about the country Only cares about kickbacks and raising his national profile. Wants senate seat
Jason chazfetts needs to be investgated!
@ZuZuToo3 Exactly! Noooo it's not...Do your job Chaffetz.
Sure, just like Benghazi took care of itself.
@suzberf who investigates Chaffetz? Something is not right!
#dutyhonorCountry
Tell @Chaffetz2012  that he needs to act. NOW!  Thanks for your help.
@SenToomey @RepCharlieDent PLEASE force Senate/House to launch an investigation into the Flynn/Trump/White House Russian ties.
And it shouldn't. Flynn was not alone in this. There are others involved. Investigate now!
@RobinBall1961 Do your job and investigate Trump
if so, why even have an oversight committee? What a fool Chaffetz is.
@ArianeBellamar @jasoninthehouse   If you do not step up you are part of the problem and you will be investigated!#TraitorJason
Thank you Sen Casey for continuing to speak out.
Investigation needs to continue WH ties to Russia. Americans need to know. Flynn is the scapegoat!
@TomWellborn Yay Senator Casey!!
Can someone send @jasoninthehouse back to Romper Room? @1SpencerGarrett
@jasoninthehouse is unqualified and unwilling to begin an investigation. He only goes after democrats. #ShameOnChaffetz
@wemesq we need to fire him as soon as his negligence is fully exposed on all this.
@Principia I called Chaffetz' office and was told "intelligence community is looking into it", what about Trump's knowledge?
@ShebaRiddle5 keep on them Sen Casey!there is more
the hypocrisy in that party knows no bounds
not when the president states the real problem is the leaks not the corruption and lies
I Think we should take care of JASON he should be pushed out of the senate he dosnt deserve to be there to imature
Lock them up!
What are they afraid of finding?
this is unbelievable and so demoralizing! Please, step it up!!! #ImpeachTrump
@jamiedupree @jasoninthehouse CongrssmnC., worry more abt having any reputation left if you don't move your tush & do your job.
if this was an HRC admin, Chafftez would be stomping  his feet all over the hill with his hair on fire!
call for an investigation on Chaffetz.. he's hiding something !
@ChuckWendig Please keep pushing on this.
keep this going senator . good job
@jfdavisspeaks What happened to draining the swamp? Time for an all expense paid vacay at Gitmo! #Treason
Pardon but this question must be asked: Is Jason Chaffetz a bumbling imbecile and as mentally incapacitated as #45?
we need an investigation, @jasoninthehouse needs to do his job!
Growing feeling that we need to investigate capabilities of Chaffetz himself. He is oblivious or complacent. We need HONORABLE.
you are a patisan hack and whats wrong with goverment
You jerk Chaffetz, it's NOT taking care of itself, it's getting worse and worse as you try to cover it up. Damn the GOP!
thank you for taking this seriously. What actions will Congress take re: Flynn and Russia?
Please push for further probing and a full investigation of all involved including @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence
@jasoninthehouse  is clearly not loyal to the United States of America. Loyal GOP members must demand his resignation

@SenBobCasey
thank you for not letting this go! It's all VERY concerning!
Go get them Senator Casey
Please don't let this go. I know you won't. Thank you!
@missLtoe @jamiedupree I'm from Ut was not bussed into Chaffetz town hall or paid. Typical of Jason to ignore Flynn He lies
@weprogressives wow..may Chaffettz needs to be investigated for his inaction
agree.
@kate_risch Thank You Senator. 
go after them @SenBobCasey !
Agree with you Senator Casey! Investigate!
ahh, just like they thought Benghazi and the email server thing took care of themselves?
@JW4Hillary Jason wants to subvert the truth. We will not be denied.
@jasoninthehouse Isn't that putting GOP interests ahead of national security? Shame on them and God help us all.
@jasoninthehouse consistently puts party over country and his own constituents. #CountryOverParty #VoteHimOut
you know if it was Hillary they freaking out
Dems in Congress should go on strike until an investigation is opened.
Do NOT let this go. The country is at stake.
Americans regardless of political party deserve answers
thank u senator 4 speaking up now 2 it's ur turn @SenToomey we r waiting!!
senator bob that should be your answer to the ? Is it okay to welcome refugees and support sanctuary cities in Pennsylvania ???
please don't let this go!  This has in no way taken care of itself.
He is a weasel. @Evan_McMullin should challenge him in 2018. Give Utah real, ethical leadership.
@flippable_org 

How/when did we get to the point where Party supercedes Country?
@jasoninthehouse, yes there is a need to probe. We are paying you people and deserve answers.
@HappyFeminist @jamiedupree Let us know the best way to apply pressure to get an investigation, Sen Casey
Thank you Senator, for doing the RIGHT thing. You will have my vote.
investige everything involving this situation.
Thank you. MULTIPLE probes of Benghazi and our #ethics chair thinks there's no more story here?  UNBELIEVABLE
U always had a bad habit of wanting to beat a dead horse when it pertains to the other side. Where were u the last 8 years Bob?
@DavidResistor You are looking pretty suspicious @jasoninthehouse
@ChuckWendig wasn't the same kind of thing said re watergate?
@SenToomey This administration has me fearful for our nation's security. Country over party. We need THOROUGH investigation.
Manafort. Flynn. Trump.  Manafort. Flynn. Trump.  Manafort. Flynn. Trump. Manafort. Flynn. Trump.  Manfort/ Flynn. Trump. Manaf
Hand-picked NSA's resigning over improper ties to/communications with Russia "ends" nothing. BEGINS everything!
What did the president know, and when did he know it? #ImpeachTrump
Senator Casey, it is of the utmost importance that Congress dig deeper. There is much more to discover. Thanks
We need to investigate Chaffetz. Seems like the Russians may have something on him.
Keep after this mess!  This has the stench of treason all over it.
- that's why @RepChaffetz stopped the investigation of @HillaryClinton when she left office....right? #GOPdoublestandard
these are ppl who assume superbugs and climate change are myths and that women have a way of shutting down rape...r we shocked?
Keep fighting the good fight, sir. Your constituents are backing you up.
Please keep pushing for further investigating, Sen. Casey! Thank you!
It's just getting started!!
Thank you, Sir,  for standing up and doing the right thing. We appreciate knowing we can count on you.
.@SenBobCasey Please, Senator, do NOT allow this scandal to go away. GOP will try to minimize, deflect, lie. Dems must push on!
Love the new, more assertive, you! Don't back down, keep up the good work. #thatsmysenator
IKR. He must be eating his Wheaties!
Washington post says FBI cleared him of any wrong doing so which is it senator
@jasoninthehouse Remember your town hall? You might want to "Do Your Job"! @SenBobCasey
This is Absolutely Disgusting OMG SCREAM BLOODY MURDER AMERICA THROW THE BUMS OUT
