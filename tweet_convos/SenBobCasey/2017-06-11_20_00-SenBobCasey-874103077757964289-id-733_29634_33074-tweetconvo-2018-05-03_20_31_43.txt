Whew! Credit to Nashville for making us earn it! #stanleycupchampions
*credit to the refs for giving it to you*
So you don't think the Preds deserve any credit. Wow. I thought the team was supposed to have good fans. 
Hey gg from a preds fan, sucks it was a blown call but it is what it is, 2 good teams
Colin, don't worry about these fans. Us, THE REAL FANS want to thank you for the great Stanley Cup Final.
Appreciate it bro, it's been a good one 

Cry
Lmao go cheer for the team that knocked out your "favourite team" last year buddy
L

Can see this is your first hockey game
Nope...
As experienced veterans we know that the refs totally were on the penguins side the whole playoffs...
Refs were totally on the pens side yet you guys got 5 PPs plus a 5 on 3 and couldn't score

They called 5 penalties against us and called 0 against Nashville
did you miss the Goal Nashville scored ?
I heard the whistle, idk about you
that's the point ... why was the whistle blowing on a lose puck ?!!!!
Because the ref lost sight of the puck and that is an actual rule....damn y'all need to educate yourself on the rules of the game
You obviously haven't read up dummy. All goals are reviewable and the timing of the whistle doesn't matter nor if the ref lost sight of puck
Again the only time they are reviewable is BEFORE the whistle if the ref loses sight...once blown NOTHING after matters #BandwagonIdiotAlert
Maybe the grittiest cup run I've seen. Congrats, Penguins.
I kept waiting to see if the injuries would catch up.
The Pens don't get the credit they deserve for fighting through injuries while playing all these extra games.
Cole was playing with a broken hand and broken rib since early in the Capitals series
Nashville fans are cry babies.
The perfect ending! #BurghProud
That is one beautiful gif!
Congratulations!
Lord Stanley Lord Stanley give me the Brandy (no seriously you owe me some Brandy after this)
Can't afford brandy after paying off the refs
Seroiusly...what game did u watch. Clearly heard whistle no dispute. No way for a ref to know they will score after he blows the whistle.
Winning at home would've been great but winning at their house with that crowd was even more satisfying.
Do the refs get their names engraved in the cup too or do they just get to hoist it?
Rules are rules like they knew the puck would go on after the whistle.  All heard it so they had to reverse it or big gone for them.
He blew the whistle way too early anyways is the thing.
Congrats guys, from a Preds fan. Hell of a series.
Thank you guys too. That was a fun series!
Fun, intense, physical, nasty. Everything hockey should be
This was honestly one of my favorite Stanley Cup Finals of all time. Probably better than the Blackhawks-Bruins series in 2014.
EICHEL IS BETTER THAN CROSBY
......... LMAO.
are lucky. Preds goal in 2nd period should have counted. #taintedtitle #taintedstanleycup
No read the rules. Goals don't count after whistle. Clearly heard it so as much as they wanted to let it count they could not.
was a quick whistle. No reason to blow the whistle when puck still loose.
Rule states: if the referee loses sight of the puck at any time they are to blow the whistle.
don't they have video replay in hockey? Or can hire more refs to watch puck? #NHLrunbyidiots @nhl
It was a battle to get a second official on the ice years ago. Players complained about losing space on the ice.
put a ref behind goal in stands to watch puck. It's not rocket science.
You know what else isn't rocket science? Understanding the rules
3peat?

#notmystanleycupchamps
Nobody cares who you think are the champions
THANK YOU GOD
@SamDMarkham @NickGreteman

Weird... I was wondering why I couldn't find any Blackhawk fans today.. turns out they were all living in the past
@alecknight_  @alecknight_ @alecknight_  @alecknight_ @alecknight_ @alecknight_ @alecknight_ @alecknight_ @alecknight_

Preds gone cat fishin
Congrats to the Pens but also low key fuck them.
Thanls to the Refs!!
Thank you Pittsburgh in beating the Preds. - Hawks fan
Real hockey towns know... You boo when Bettman is speaking and then quit when his speech is over. It's #Smashville though, newbies.
#Predators have #noclass booing the #stanleycup  #5xChamps #5Cups #LetsGoPens #StanleyCupFinals #NHLPLAYOFFS
Probably some sad country songs to be sung in Nashville now.

Sidney Crosby 3-Time Stanley Cup Champion!
talk about a fluke whistle/no-goal, Pens.  Get a star/Captain that doesn't cry!
Get some cup wins or a super bowl win than nashville and the entire state of TN can talk than.
Okay og6 fan.  By the way, my team does have a cup. 1999.  I know enough about hockey to know that should have been Preds 1-0 off that play.
When is the parade??

Everyone that doubted, where are you now?
Oh yea that's right. Not tweeting at me.
They did it @KateJennD! Great series. 
Why did you rt this @jonna_isaac
Bc I'm a penguins fan by default of being a Steelers fan
Booooooooo 
That disallowed goal tho..
That hornqvist goal tho
You right tho
It was a fun series to watch and back to back is pretty impressive too
@macandjesus
they may b called the penguins but we all know they r snakes
NHL refs have been horrible for 3 years now, their favorite team will always win or whomever bettman tells them will win
4 penalties to 0 Preds?
One game? I'm referring to the entire last 3 seasons, like I said Pitt has skill, no class,, NHL refs are worse!!
Can't believe you're actually taking credit for it but ok
Pens had hardest route to the cup. Whatever if it makes you feel better. 0 goals in 1/3 of the finals games played. Stupid tweet
Greg, did you watch the playoffs or
Lord Stanley Lord Stanley....GIVE US THAT CUP!!!!!!!!!!!
No no no. I believe it's "Lord Stanley, Lord Stanley, breakout the Brandy".
Right now it's give us the cup...there will be plenty of libations filling it soon
On a shit call... Should be in OT
I am blaming the refs lol.. if they would've made the right call, it could've been a different game outcome. We'll never know now!
Okay now you sound like GSW fans
Haha sorry... I just looked watching a good series and hate seeing games end like that
Lol nuts busting your balls. I didnt even see the game last night haha

Carl, we all miss you at MSG. Congrats on your wedding..Glad to see you honeymooned in Italy!!!!!!
Any real Penguin fans care to tell this one not to attack grieving widowers? Sad to have her associated with your good name.
Till they lob our bloody noggins off.
Go Pens go! :)
Congratulations on the championship! Any chance you can help save the real life penguins?
Hccti
Shagadelic baby
