.@POTUS's pardon of Joe Arpaio, who illegally profiled Latinos, undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3B0E692D-FFEB-4F6C-ADF9-C3F598E94D2A …

Let's face it Trump embarrassed McCain so badly McCain has quit his day job to be TRASH TRUMP 24-7....McCain is only embarrassing himself!
Where were you when Obama released Chelsea Manning? Not a word from you when a traitor was given a pardon.
Meanwhile...
Awful - how many rapists and murders did Obama pardon? More thank any other president? Sheriff Joe was doing his job protecting us
One thing Obama wasn't and that was a racist cuz Trump and  Joe are racist and that's one thing you can't say about them too demons you too
Where was your opposition to Obama's abuse of pardons?? #RINOs
Does that in/c Prez Clinton when he pardoned Marc Rich & his wife donated 100k to hrc senate campaign; 450k to clinton library? Crickets....
Change can only come when ppl are prepared to stand by principled convictions.  I applaud this by partisan approach, let us have more.
“@SenBobCasey: I stand w/ @SenJohnMcCain. The opposition to this abuse of the pardon process is bipartisan. https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/901276851561222144 …”

Senator, standing with @SenJohnMcCain is like standing for an ice cube in hell.
Thank you, sir. Please help preserve our nation. 45 has no respect for the people or the rule of law. Please, stop him! #ImpeachTrump #25A
Where were LIBS like SEN CASEY & SEN MCCAIN when Bill Clinton pardoned his own brother? NO OUTRAGE FROM THESE GUYS THEN! HOW ABOUT THAT!
Glad you openly hate this pardon. Where was the furor when @BarackObama pardoned a traitor,cop killer, and released terrorists? Hypocrisy.
Thank you for speaking up. It's time to end this. 25thAmendmentNow
maybe you might have a civil war with whom? The 30% that approve of 45?
Oh wait the ball of collusion is about to happen  hold on to your hats
I pray you're right abt that becuz our country can't take my more of him!!
Liberals hate religion? No, we want a normal POTUS where is he? 
Trump is a carnival barker
Oscar Lopez Rivera
Please do something concrete to hold 45 accountable
Did McCain get pardoned by Nixon?
Republicans need to do more than just retweet Sen McCain. You have to take action and stop POTUS from promoting injustice and hate.
Stop talking and start doing something about it then.
Arapaio is a hero
Obama/Holder profiling whites from Day One. Even now as they guide #Resistance. How will #TrumpTrain ever trust of Democrats now? #NotSmooth
His acts were criminal!
#IMPEACHTRUMPNOW how much more does he have to do before someone STANDS UP and does the RIGHT thing by this COUNTRY????
With that Vietnam "Songbird" John McCain? He was a traitor guilty of treason then and he still is now. His stripes never changed.
Thank you John McCain for taking a stand for what is right
So impeach him then.  Casey, McCain its country over party.  McCain Honor, Courage, Commitment-remember that?
Any word from Pat Toomey or Ryan Costello?
I stand with President Trump as nd Sheriff Joe. Get over it.
No, you get over it. If you stand with them you have no morality whatsoever. I hope you have no children to corrupt. #TrumpResign
How about YOU get over it? Your hapless and message less candidate lost. Start acting like a damn American and work to better your nation.
Does anyone know -  can the state of AZ file charges against Arpaio now? Conviction in state court would not be pardonable.
@ACLU
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Please continue to oppose 45 publicly but please also VOTE against him. He is a threat!
It also undermines his comments on #Charlottesville
Yes, but what will be done about it?
HAS he actually ever claimed he respects the rule of law?  I missed that
Y'all keep talking as elections near Lol
You can stand together and tweet together, the question is when are you all going to work together to oust this disaster. #alltalknoaction
But u were delerious over Obama's despicable pardons & release of terrorists!
https://www.justice.gov/pardon/obama-pardons#PJAN172017 …
Standing with McCain does not seem to be a prudent move, his corrupt anti-President activities are catching up to him. The correct term is
treasonous. But hey, that has always been suspected of/by McCain. Nothing new here really!
What are you DOING about it?!
Congress needs to act to prevent Trump from pardoning himself and team if involved in wrongdoing.Ain't right for him to have such authority.
NOW DO SOMETHING.
Then do something to stop these outrages, Senator. He is laughing at you and mocking the Constitution. You have the power; stop him.
Who the hell is Bob Casey oh wait a nobody
Impeach, no void the Electoral College results.  #HRC45
How about standing with the legal citizens you represent!!a
oh not so illegal when democrats parton people. whats good for the goose is good for the gander
Please do something
@SenJohnMcCain is rarely on the right side of anything so I'll wait for more details. @BarackObama was an asshole who hated @RealSheriffJoe
But Obama pardon druggies and terrist.That Sheriff was trying toup hold our constitution. Wethepeople standbehind #Trump look tobe voted out
Yeah, but what are you going to DO about Trump???? Sound of crickets....

We've been covering Joe Arpaio for more than 20 years. Here's a couple of things you should know about him... 1/many
Concentration camps. Read it again. Say it aloud. Let it sink in.
http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-19646196.html …
Please take action. Trump is a pathological liar and unfit to serve as President. Get him out of office now! Thank you Senators!
Senators majority of the Americans stand with you! @SuitcaseMemoirs @SuitcaseMemoirs @bukhari_ny @SuitcaseMemoirs
Thank you. Pls do a veto-proof bill blocking a pres from pardoning self or fam. He will try so beat him to it.
Please respect my vote for my President Trump and join together to Make America Great
#replaceCasey2018
Then use your influence to convince your fellow legislators to begin the impeachment. We're tired of well-meaning lip service.
And I stand w/ @SenBobCasey
When can we expect to see articles of #Impeachment Senators @SenBobCasey & @SenJohnMcCain? Enough talk; we need action before it's too late.
Hey @SenToomey , are you going to stand for the rule of law as well?
Well we are waiting??
Big deal. You really stand with trump. Do something and stop taliking
Senator.  Could you please ask Trump to quit holding little girls like this?  It bothers women that have been sexually abused.  PLEASE
I've seen so many pictures where he does this.  If he hasn't been accused of threatening a 13 year old while she is giving him oral sex then
Stand up against this! It's a test balloon, a message of comfort to co- conspirators, and the act of a megalomaniac. Flynn pardon is next.
Senator, remember PA voted republican!!
@POTUS so do i
I stand with potus
So what now @SenJohnMcCain and @GOP? @SpeakerRyan tepid response, @SenateMajLdr silent... WTF NOW??
Stop the gasps or outrage and pearl clutching and DO something about him! #impeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpAndPence #impeach
Ok, so wtf are you going to do about it?! Being a senator against something doesn't mean  if you don't do something about it...we'll wait
DO SOMETHING.  The man brutalized and degraded AMERICAN CITIZENS as well.  YOU MUST DO SOMETHING. #GOP #ArpaioPardon
When will you do something about it ?  It's already so late  !  TAX RETURNS, NOW
Maybe a little less standing and a little more removing...
Great, awesome, now impeach Trump. Do the job that the American people elected you to do.
So when Obama pardoned people who committed treason to our country you don't say a word but now u do for a misdemeanor
I guess you 2 were too busy voting for people like Betsy DeVos and Rex Tillerson.   You're too late to criticize now, traitors. Nice try.
I don't believe a word any one of you speak anymore, not a single word! You are all liars!
Go back and #arrest that #corrupt POS for one of his many other crimes
Now let's see @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr & rest of #GOP stop talking & #IMPEACHTRUMP!
Be careful RogerStone threatened him (like Mccain gives a damn)
Does John even know his name most days
What are you going to do about it? Talk is cheap.  This is an impeachable offense.
Why does PA have highest GasTax? Pa's in trouble b/c UnfundedPensions will other RetireePensions be txed to cover? StickToYourKnitting #MAGA
WTF PA gas tax have to do with @potus endorsing arpaio's subversion of the fourth amendment?

#AbuseOfPower #Impeach
Why does PA have highest GasTax? Pa's in trouble b/c UnfundedPensions will other RetireePensions be txed to cover? StickToYourKnitting #MAGA
IllegalsAren'tCitizens protected by 4thAmend. Casey shld lookout for his own constituents McCain isn't thinking Country but BruisedEgo #MAGA
So, you're saying there is no opposition to this crap, because you people are completely unwilling to work together on anything meaningful.
Zzzzzzzz
Could y'all just get together for impeachment? Not sure you need to wait for Mueller.
If only there were some way Congress could check a President guilty of #AbusesOfPower !!
Congressional Censure of the president might be in order
Oh cram it dude. Clinton pardons a major tax cheat, Obama pardons drug dealers and murderers, none of you in DC make a sound.
Standing isn't enough but thank you. GOP keep disapproving of Rump's Dumps but remain cowards for not impeaching.
Lots of evidence of abuse of power & governing only for his "base" base. Swore to protect defend uphold Constitution.
THEN DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is that a battle cry?
The fetuses of women held for trial in his jail did not deserve to die from his neglectful policies.
Well, let's do something about it NOW
Senators, may you and your colleagues oppose with ACTIONS as well as words. The enablement must stop!
Daily violations of Emoluments, Constitution, laws, + racism & now abuse of power! When is Congress going 2 say enough & #ImpeachTrump NOW?!
If ANY Dem Pres would have done anything close 2 what 45 has done, Congress would've already impeached & removed from office! #ImpeachTrump
Let's see bipartisan "doing something about it"
Maybe you should all get together and impeach him and Pence ?
seems to me that standing there is one thing
when is .@gop going to do something?
Talk is cheap and action speaks louder than words. What R U going 2 do about this man in the White House?
Then DO SOMETHING PLEASE before it is too late!  How many times must we say this?!
tRump needs to be fired.
Then do something, coward
Gentlemen, the ball is in your park. Do something about this man who is clearly abusing his power & making a mockery of the W.H, GOP & USA.
" in its utter meaningless."
So we're going to get a bipartisan impeachment process started?
Can Republicans actually DO something other than a slap on the wrist?
We can thank @realDonaldTrump for showing the flaws in pardon process. Now you all need to fix it!
Didn't hear either of you say a word about Manning pardon. @SenJohnMcCain, you cry like the RINO you are.
Sorry Bob, but the abuse by @POTUS44 of pardon authority was far more egregious!
Bob Casey, where were you when Obama pardoned the PR terrorist? John, I don't remember much hullabaloo from I when WJC pardoned drug dlrs.
So what are you going to do about it?
Thank you Senator Casey. If there's anything that can be done to stop Trump, please help us and do it.
This "pardon" is another case of obstruction of justice!
You both realize tweeting isn't the same as doing something,right?
Funny, but no problem when Obama pardoned criminals. Somewhat of a double standard Bobby
What are you going to *do* about it?
So what are you doing about it?
And what, pray tell, do you plan to do about it?
I stand w/ @SenJohnMcCain. The opposition to this abuse of the pardon process is bipartisan. https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/901276851561222144 …
Dooo something
"Opposition" MUST go beyond chatter to action. Trump's flagrant disregard 4 the law, combined w/his bigotry r destabilizing our country.
every pardon over turns a court ordered decree, all pardons are meant to do just that.
WHAT are you gonna do about it? 

Can you rein in GOP/Congress to address the legal menace you call POTUS? 

COUNTRY over party!
Make the stand public when you get back to Washington
And what are you all doing about this abomination of a president ? Waiting .......
Thank you, Senator! Now, what are you & your colleagues going to do about it, and how can we help?
Makes sense! You're both Obstructionist UnAmerican Democrat traitors!!McCain should love the pardon!!He got one for the murders on Forestall
You should and will be voted out of Senate-every traitor will!And who cares of what you say? Where were you when Obama pardoned a terrorist?
Impeach him, or shut the hell up.
SO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ALREADY!
I wonder, regardless of this Pardon. If Joe Arpaio loses his 2nd amendment right to own a Firearm? Equally, does he lose his Voting Rights?
So what do you propose to *do* about it? #25A
I would like to believe our country is still better than this- we need unity
Thank you for showing integrity and respect for humanity!
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
Thank you for standing up....
You're useless Casey #termlimits All of this faux outrage over the pardoning of Sheriff Joe Arpaio is absurd.
in the meantime mccain voted for trump people and policies 96% of the time.
it's way too late, john.
So what are you going to do about it, other than tweet?
Thank you. Yes it was. Now what?
Wait wait wait. How could mccain an az pol and prisoner of war, know about arpaio and allow his evil to go on for so long? Now he cares?
@POTUS figures enjoy last looks from your senate office
Doesn't matter unless he is impeached. Period.
Dude. Quit being mealy-mouthed. Assert yourself. Stand up. Speak out. Louder.
Why don't you stand to get rid of DJT. People will never forget which side you were on
That's great, but what is @GOP going to DO about it?
But what can you do about it? Un pardon him? You all need to get rid of this jackass!!!
Congress must act now#trumpmustvo
Trump has NEVER respected the rule of law
N E V E R !
So do something about this nonsense
Stand smand. Agree ? Whoopie. DO SOMETHING before its too late.
Don't just "stand with". DO SOMETHING! #protectourdemocracy #protectourcountry #protectourfuture #Gethimout
Talk is cheap, Senator. What are you going to DO about it?
So are you gonna impeach him because tweets don't do shit.
Actually it's not. McCain is no Republican.
it needs to be made clear that any pardon in the Mueller investigation will lead to impeachment.
@Nixanadoo @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Don't know how Pres. Kelly allowed this. Must be busy firing Ivanka and Jared.
Thank you!
Can you tell me how many times he spoke out on the senate floor ago Arpaio when he was profiling in his hometown?
I agree that it is morally and socially wrong, but there is no such thing as an abuse of the pardon process. It's an unlimited power.
Good for you. Now maybe do something about him instead of just chastising.
Did you know that if you hadn't cheated America out of Sanders this never would have happened. You are a corporate shill...... Sanders 2020
@POTUS Any #GOP who doesn't stand up against this abuse of the law is just as evil as #DJT. @SenateGOP @funder
What are you two gonna do, though? Talk does not cook rice.
That's because it is wrong and everyone but 35% of the country knows it.
So what are you going to do about it! Abuse of pardon power is an impeachable offense. Get moving!
another good Democrat supporting you John. Pretty disgraceful in my opinion and a clear message on where your priorities really lie. #RINO
But you were all for pardoning  that thing Manning even though it's treachery cost allies and translators their lives. Think b4 you speak.
Exactly Jeff 
The opposition is vocal, but it's not useful or effective.
the constitution grants a plenary power to pardon. That means it cannot be 'abused', you half-wit
Then fucking do something about it or stop tweeting. I'm a normal person & have done more to stop him than you, who have done NOTHING
And for the thousandth time, what are you gonna do about it? He's laughing at all of us.
So do something about it.
