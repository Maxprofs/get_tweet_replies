Generations of Americans have fought for the fundamental principles of this nation. We have a sacred obligation to do the same.
If there's a way to make our refugee screening process better, I'm ready to discuss it.
But a #MuslimBan by another name is not who we are and won't make us any safer.
thank you 
We're with you, Senator Casey.
Thank you Senator Casey from one of your constituents

Thank you @SenBobCasey - Founding Fathers would be ashamed of @realDonaldTrump

thank you so so much for being there tonight Senator! It means so much to many of your constituents.
Please do more, please organize a visible protest against the Muslim ban, just as individual citizens are doing.
Impeach
Just like Obama did in 2011 and Jimmy Carter did in 1979.
Thank you for standing up for ALL Americans against @realDonaldTrump & his dangerous unConstitutional agenda! PA is with you!
Thank you, Sen Casey!
Thank God someone is standing up for true American values. Thank you Bob.
.@SenBobCasey how do we work together to get  @realDonaldTrump impeached? He's currently #1 national security threat.
.@SenBobCasey not to mention the unconstitutional EO @realDonaldTrump made AND the questionable/scary changes to NSC
Thank you, appreciate your vocal opposition to these atrocious policies, plz encourage other Senators to do so
How can we help?
bless you @SenBobCasey where is @PatToomey #coward
@chuckwendig how about the promise to american citizens
it wasn't political. People really need to understand that Trump is honestly scared shitless about terrorism.
He actually believes we haven't never been in more danger than we are today.
that is what makes him so dangerous.
if he were political he might be controllable.
Politics is what controls our baser instincts.
In a psychopaths parallel universe the reverse is true
Problem yeah, how about Toomey?
THANK YOU! As once GOP I am embarrassed by their cowardice. Fight on.
Is your "promise" the decay of American security and prosperity? Count me out, Bob.
Thank you @SenBobCasey for standing up for American values. We will not forget. #resist
impeach trump

too bad ur party lost over 1,000 mayoral, governor, state House seats, lost the Senate, House & White Hse & prob 3 scotus seats
Sad and frightening that the Republican Senators can't seem to find courage or a soul to join the fight.
thank you? And what cowardly den are @SenToomey & @RepRyanCostello hiding in? R they men or mice? #disgusted #NoWallNoBan
.@SenBobCasey @pjhnsn8 @realDonaldTrump doesn't he know US has been doing "extreme vetting" since 9-11? Thanks for standing up  #mySenator
we don't owe the promise of America to the whole world,they don't all like us in case you haven't noticed
@MrSpock2017 thank you @SenBobCasey for supporting everything America stands for
good for you, Senator...you have our support!
Thank you , sir ....//@SenBobCasey
don't worry about politics worry about country
So Obama's executive orders good? Trump's bad? Ok........
Bannon now on National Security Council principles cmte? Stop Bannon! We did not vote for or vet him!
