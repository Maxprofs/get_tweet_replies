Yes
I don't know how Cruz is our Senator.  Even my conservative knucklehead Trump voter neighbors and friends don't like him...
L. Graham said it best early in campaign.....right on senate floor!! He's got to be the most hated senator in that chamber
If the #Pharma shills "body parts & diseases" orgs hate it, it means Cruz's #health proposal is absolutely the right choice for Americans
Not The American Cancer Society
@SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis @SenateMajLdr
Little TEDDY NO MOUTH  needs to shut up ! He's a joke! And cruel!!
I am curious to know, did any of these Orgs support DT, and the GOP?
If AARP is against it then we should be for it.
.@tedcruz  Well, at least you're "consistently" pathetic.
Phone calls, faxes, letters, emails and personal visits make a huge impact on MoCs.And bigger picture, never forget the power of your vote.
@tedcruz website requires you to leave your social security # in order to communicate with him
I sent an email months ago and it was not http://required.Got  a form response so now I call.

Is it legal to require ss#? New policy?
When writing to my other reps, no ss# was required. Only Cruz. He may have changed policy.  #stillacreep
Consider the evil source
Why would anyone vote yes to a bill that has been pushed by a FAKE POTUS. Every time they re-write this bill it gets worse #KillTheBill
ACA is no longer sustainable or affordable. For ACA=for government single payor. Admit that and from there we can make arguments pro and con
@GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @tedcruz Obviously, after years of 'work', you have no good ideas!
Ppl have always talked about how smart @tedcruz Is. If that's true he does a great job of hiding it.
@SenTedCruz  nice Teddie seat up 2018 right vite him out..
You mean Ted Sarsour?
@SpeakerBoehner
Seems like the only group supporting it are the Evangelicals! Why?
$$$$$

We see you @SenToomey
What say ye .@tedcruz ?  Are you still intent upon killing thousands of your constituents?
As one of his constituents with a preexisting condition, I've given up any hope that @tedcruz will ever do the right thing about anything.
I think that Cruz should be deported back to Cuba.  Can we get that to happen?
Or Canada??
Oh no.  Canada doesn't deserve him back there.  He needs to go back to his roots!  Fascist!
Maybe Elba, Isle of Exile. Many could be sent there.
Yes
@SenateMajLdr 
@SpeakerPaulRyan
@SenJohnMcCain
@LindsayGrahamSC
@SenDeanHeller
@SenCapito - Please don't follow your Leaders -
Why would @tedcruz propose that asinine amendment? How does that help him, #GOP, or citizens? Worthless is worthless, even if cheap. #BCRA
Do u expect any less from the most hated man in the senate?
Cruz is laughable.
To anybody listening: stakeholders had no real input and have been geared up to fight this orphan bill loved by no one
@tedcruz you are dreaming of WH, never! You don't take care of #Texans, certainly blew #Healthcare with #noinsurance. Glad your wife works
@FoxNews @foxandfriends
Ha! Another left wing organization. Ignore, ignore, ignore.
Right, AARP would sell out their grandmother, which they did when they backed the ACA.
.@tedcruz #Trumpcare
@tedcruz loves this stuff.  he loves to be hated. his senate seat is bought & paid for.  he is the epitome of everything wrong in politics.
I like how the put "and Cruz is an ASSHOLE" at the end of their statement.
#FakeNews: Ted Cruz never committed to protect Americans. He is too busy helping Donald help the Russians.
I think it could be stated simpler. The Cruz healthcare proposal is betrayal of Americans.
@ShaunKing Hopefully, other groups like, NEA;NAN;NAACP&Unions will join forces 2 help protest & turn out the vote in 481 days.
@SenTedCruz he already abandoned defending his wife....Americans means nothing.
#magaFRAUDS
NV Patients: PLEASE @SenDeanHeller DO NOT FLIP. People with serious illness want to stay alive and able. Remember us. #ProtectPatientsNow
Those orgs like their operative insurance kickbacks; after all, there's plenty of fraud to spread around!
Remember, that's an insurance pencil pusher talking out of the left side of his rear end mouth; let free markets determine cost & coverage!
And he will answer, ‘I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these ... you were refusing to help me.’
Matthew 25:45
The worst part about this statement is that it won't shock anyone. Both parties have been working against best interest of  for decades!
@tedcruz These groups are concerned about people's health and financials UNLIKE TED CRUZ
obamacare was the betrayal.  govt changed healthcare to control, no care.  #FullRepeal #GetGovtOutOfHealthcare
Cruz  and Koch sitting in a tree . . ,
Here's the Cruz plan in one panel:
@tedcruz Shove this up your butt.
Ted Cruz is an amoeba who took over a somewhat human looking form. Somewhat.
Well @tedcruz does not care how many people die to serve his sick, twisted beliefs, he's a "king" in his religious cult.
: "American Cancer Society, AARP and nearly a dozen other orgs slam Cruz health…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=885167286709096450 …
Pound sand. aarp KNEW Obama stole $250 mil from Medicare and did NOTHING. They supported Obama
The ACA extended the Medicare trust fund from 2017 to 2029, protecting everyone on Medicare
Only @SenTedCruz could be against cancer victims, our elderly, and dozens others and still behave in such a sanctimonious manner in doing so
American Cancer society is a fraud
@RepChrisCollins you should be speaking out against this bill as it will cause great harm to the constituents of NY27.
Congress needs to hear more pub comment frm broad spectrum of large orgs involved w/healthcare re: why they aren't allowed to give input!
Two words for you my friend: Medigap Insurance.

Seems like the whole @gop are "a betrayal of the commitment to protect Americans" Seems like quite the opposite, in fact. Americans will die
Premeditated murder which gives states right to ignore all 10 of patient protection plans including preexisting conditions.
Attn: @tedcruz @SenateGOP
@tedcruz I am embarrassed you represent the state of Texas.
Well, sure, but what did they think about his health proposal? 

Zing!
Sometimes I wonder how Ted Cruz sleeps at night after doing something like this.
Probably just fine on fat sacks stuffed w/ donor dollars.
The GOP just doesn't get it. As a cancer survivor, ACA saved my life. Literally! Without it I couldn't have afforded treatment!
Have you ever thought about why treatment costs so much? The real crime is in the middle, not between you and your doctors! Fraud costs soar
The real problem is the GOP trying to take health care away from millions and not even thinking twice about doing it. It's shameful!
What a stark contrast to the way Republicans are describing this bill as "following through on their commitment to repeal Obamacare..."
For Cruz it is giving his benefactors money and thinning the herd.
Scruz is a fraud. He wants junk insurance!
