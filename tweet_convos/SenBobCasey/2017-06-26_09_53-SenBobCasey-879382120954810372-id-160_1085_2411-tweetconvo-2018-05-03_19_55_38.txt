How many calls & emails are for it?
In the same time frame, around 200 calls & emails were in favor of the GOP plan.
This doesn't tell us anything. I'm opposed to it too, but for different reasons than the Dems. Some of us want free market capitalism.
And yes, you're going to get calls, because you're taking away free stuff that the government gave them at the cost of the taxpayers.
I have no problem paying more taxes if it means other people get to live.
If it means better healthcare for Americans, yup.
But it's not better. Worse premiums, higher co-pays, and working Americans have lost coverage because they can't afford it.
I've worked in healthcare for years. Trust me it's better than what we had before. Fix the inconveniences. Don't throw away people's health
I'd be curious if @SenToomey office will release the opposition numbers as well. #toomeydoesntrepresentPA
Can you set call forwarding to Pat?
@SenToomey won't answer the phone when the heat is on.
He answered for me today! Dunno if he listened.
the rest of us are busy working,that's not many votes,you're heading for yuge loss in 2018,career politicians need term limits
You forgot the millions in pa that have voted for President Trump and repeal that crap you democrats forced on the majority of Americans
Does anyone believe this! Paid resisters are in full swing and are on the airwaves & dems want to have abortions.medicad overloaded
Now stand up for single payer or at least a public option! Do what's right Bob!
Thanks @SenBobCasey for the numbers.  Would be nice for #HealthcareBill #s from @SenCoryGardner if he wasn't smoozing w/ rich ppl who  him!
Add me to the list. This bill sucks
And actually most of us assume you are on board. We are all emailing and calling #LyingToomey @SenToomey
What about my call for you to go for it?
Stay strong, @SenBobCasey , and resist this punishing proposal. TY
But still going 2 pass because "Screw the Hard-working American families" is like chocolate melting n the GOPs' mouth. Greed tastes so Good!
@RepMcClintock  -what are your numbers?
thank You Senator
That's nothing. Over 200,000,000 have a problem with Obamacare.
OBAMACARE IS UNAFFORDABLE! STOLE MONEY  FROM MEDICARE TO FUND! PA RESIDENTS SHOULDN'T B FORCED TO BUY H.C.  CHOICE=COMPETITION

Congrats u have figured out when as u regularly do rob peter 2 pay paul paul will support u. I'm opposed 2 the bill n/c its still overreach
Thank you
I sent my opposition email to @SenToomey. II know that you have the best interests of your constituents at heart. Toomey? Not so much.
I wish I had all day to call and complain ..... But working makes it hard. Glad you all have so much time on ur hands
Please listen to them.
Doctor, you need to stop. 
Nurse: Patient--The bill--is in a deep coma. Nothing you can do now. 
#cboscore #trumpcare #fixandrepair 1/15 
How many emails and phone calls about the Obama care failure Bobbie? #bullshit
Maybe Sen Casey could pass Sen Toomey notes like in high school?  Because we need to get to Toomey some way!
Do whats right for the people!we all deserve proper affordable health care
are any of them also contacting @SenToomey ?  He seems to think the bill is A-OK :(
Fair to say the missing Toomey received the same?
Thankful you are my Senator. My family appreciates your efforts. It is a terrible plan.
Wow, 17,500 in opposition out of 13 MILLION people in PA.  Clearly that's a vast majority. Is PA really speaking out? #getaclue
Thank you for listening and doing the right thing. Too bad your counterpart @SenToomey can't be bothered with us. 
Dear @SenBobCasey, please convey my thanks to every Dem who endorsed Hillary over Bernie & especially those who stayed neutral.
Without your wisdom & foresight, @SenBobCasey, Donald Trump would be POTUS right now & working w/GOP majorities to dismantle #ObamaCare.
Thank you Senator Casey! Keep logging our messages and keep fighting for PA!
@SenBobCasey - thx for listening to your constituents! @SenToomey how about you???????
Please listen and act accordingly. We, the people, need you now more than ever!
How many has your office gotten, @PatToomey? Vote NO on this atrocity!
no chance that any of Pat Toomey's family are part of the 22M that will lose coverage. He is out of touch with the ppl of this country
Keep it up people. The calls r working
Can you imagine how many you get in the fall if you don't pass this bill now and have to deal with 60 votes? Get off your duff and vote yes
No one cares, your party lost.
@SenToomey, what are your numbers???
But Bob, YOU did not stand for single payer, so blood is on your hands.
That's great, but I hope those same Pennsylvanians are calling Sen Toomey!!!!!
Keep it up! How many did Toomey get? Not enough! He still wants to take your healthcare & your money! Bob, put a number on it! How much?
So when obamacare completely fails...how is this worse???
I called sir.
PLEEEZ tell me Dems are working on repairing ACA.
And +1 Tweet in opposition, Senator!
If only @SenToomey  were as responsive to his constituents as you are.
Please keep fighting the good fight. Citizens of PA need you and appreciate what you are trying to do to represent us
Paid for by????
No one is saying this so called resistance is not well organized. I believe best answer is #FullRepeal Too much wrong with OC to fix
And yet your office won't respond to my concerns on SB/ HB 76 sent to you 4 months ago. SMH
I'm 57 and I won't be able to afford health ins under this bill.  I hope there are YouTube videos on appendectomies.
#MedicaidMatters
Let it die on it's own.  They all, and I mean all, said it would take care of itself.  Ok.
#NoBailout
I didn't call you. I know you will do the right thing. But I did call @SenToomey because he doesn't know right from wrong.  Can u sway him?
Adding my voice here, and also adding my heartfelt thanks for your support of your constituents.
1 Why didn't you fix the real problem 10 years ago when you passed Obamacare IPublic traded insurers and health systems with profit motive
2 the federally protected drug patents driving up drug prices         
 3  remove state lines for insurance companies
4 Break up conglomerates like UPMC
5 make it illegal to own insurance company and healthcare systems 
6 Leave individual mandate to force people to buy insurance
Let's start there instead of just giving out free healthcare it's the job of the individual to be held accountable and you as well
This matters , it's personal, it hurts my family, Thanks for fighting for Pennsylvanians
I'd call you, too, but I know how you'll vote. Thanks!
@WhatsPatUpTo Thanks for the info. @SenToomey's Pittsburgh office refused that info to me today.
I WANT obama care REPEALED! Don't care if it's replaced but it needs REPEALED!
I've been focusing my energy on @SenToomey I know it's a lost cause, but he needs to stop pandering to the Koch brothers
Thank you for your opposition to this plan.
If you want US fairness by democracy, ask @SenBobCasy to Cosponsor annual #DCstatehood bill #S1278 2017, to restore US #VotingRights to DC.
Fully fed taxed DC citizens vote for USPresident, but ongoing JimCrow tyranny Gov't violence bans all actual legislature elections in DC.
So DC citizens have no actual USSenators or USReps to support or oppose any US legislation, law, tax, or war, so DC can't oppose #TrumpCare.
As JimCrow tyranny strangles annual locally preferred #DCstatehood bill, Cosponsoring is the only way USSens & USReps can leave record pro.
I'm focusing my efforts on calling the R's. I know you're going to do the right thing and vote NO.  Them, not so much.
Help fix the problem
Would be great if u can help fellow PA Senator @SenToomey understand why so many are speaking out against this legislation. #TrumpCareFail
Bob what have you done to improve the legislation? #Obstruction Don't be a whiner improve it and be a winner. #LeadFollowOrGetOutOfTheWay
What does @PatToomey have to say?  *Crickets* #GOPDeathCare
@SenToomey Follow @SenBobCasey and do the right thing
Senator Casey has @SenToomey made any attempt to contact you?
If you're getting that many calls, imagine how many more Pat Toomey is receiving.
MR. CASEY why do you assume government can solve all our problems? When usually government is the root of all our problems. Please advise.
Maybe @SenToomey should get his fingers out of his ears, listen to doctors and rural hospitals in Pennsylvania...
You sir are a joke. Luke before 2010 people died in the streets right.
Yes because they all read it, right? PA hates you
Interesting since the proposal wasn't published that long ago - report actual facts about the proposal - cuts versus reductions in spend
How many to not vote for or to repeal Ocare?
Thank you for listening to us whereas your counterpart could care less.
And how many in support?  Report THAT number, Bob!  #resign
Republicans are receiving the same opposition, but they don't listen to their constituents. Public servants, who serve themselves.
You are not your dad,
How many tweets?   I don't support the GOP house bill.  In fact it boils down to pre meditated murder if it passes.
If any 1 person thinks Im angry losing an essential benefit you're wrong. I would trade them all in for my boys to be #hemophilia free #true
Which means @PatToomey has gotten similar. And doesn't care. Not one bit.
Of course not. He's a shill.
please forward each and every email to the repugnant @SenToomey
@SenToomey won't admit how many calls/emails/faxes he has gotten in opposition
Because @SenToomey is a coward and doesn't want to hear us. He just keeps pushing forward his cruel agenda to make his rich donors happy
As one of your constituents, THANK YOU, Senator, for continuing to oppose this monstrosity.
At least PA has one good senator.  Thank you, Mr. Casey
Now may we hear from the other senator @SenToomey how many calls he received opposing the bill
How many are conservative voters looking for #FreeMarket competition across state lines instead of #Obamacare fail default to single payer
Wonder what's happening at the other PA senator's office?
Love to Pennsylvania. Almost makes up for the fact they gave us Trump...but not quite.
I'm not from your jurisdiction, but my sincerest thanks, Senator, for pushing the fight against this debacle.
Proud to be one of them, Senator. Thank you for fighting for Pennsylvania and the rest of our nation. #resist
think there are more voters than that in PA Bob
@SenBobCasey, do most senators count emails? I've heard they're largely ignored. Thanks for all you do.
Any of them urging you to quit the fearmongering & vote for this Bill?  #RepealAndReplace #AHCA
The bill will hurt us, Senator. We urge you to vote NO, #killthebill and block everything until this absurd and hateful tax cut is gone.
Pretty good out of 12.33 million people...would be way more impressive if there was only 120k people in PA.  Great marketing try tho...
I have yet to get through to your counterpart, @SenToomey
Your the best Senator. Thank God you belong to Pa.
Include me too, Senator. I am opposed to the GOP Health (un)Care Plan. I am an Allegheny County resident.
Keep up the fight Senator Casey.  I voted for you in the past and will do so in November 2018.
Average individual premiums increased in Pennsylvania by 120% and people want to keep Obamacare? Wake up!
Wow, and I haven't bothered calling because I know you're on the right side. I've made all my calls to Toomey!
I would call or email, but I already know that you "have our backs" in PA.  Can't wait to vote for you again in 2018!
don't believe produce the phone records and emails! Maybe it was the Russians.
How many for?
I have been calling Toomey because he is deplorable enough to vote for this horrible bill.
He was deplorable enough to help draft it.
I'm guessing someone else counted them since I am certain Casey can't count that high
Count me in.  But I'll call if you're counting
Add the tweets to those numbers, too!!
And opposition to trump.  Impeachment soon please
Can you send them over to @SenToomey he is the one that worked on this, and seems to want to shaft Pennsylvania.
What about faxes?
Can you forward those along to @SenToomey? He seems to have priorities other than the health of his constituents.
Any comments about the Lynch or Sander's investigations?
Has @SenToomey shared his for/against call numbers with anyone yet?
@RepBrianFitz @GovernorTomWolf
How many have you received, @SenToomey? Are you listening?
Now if only @PatToomey would start listening to us. Don't see that happening anytime soon
Free tip for @SenToomey: be more like this guy
Haven't contacted you, pretty sure where you stand. Wish we could change the mind of our other senator @SenToomey  he's getting my calls.
@SenBobCasey My kids are counting on you. Keep fighting to #SaveMedicaid & #ACA. We need #CareNotChaos. cc: @SenToomey
CALL YOUR SENATORS Now! Its so easy to use!
202-224-3121
Can you please deliver those to @PatToomey?
You really need to do something about rising child care costs.. $1,500 a month for two kids 40 hrs a week
Wolfe put more childcare  in this budget
My home state making me proud. #AHCAKills
I am opposed to the Senate Healthcare bill !!!
