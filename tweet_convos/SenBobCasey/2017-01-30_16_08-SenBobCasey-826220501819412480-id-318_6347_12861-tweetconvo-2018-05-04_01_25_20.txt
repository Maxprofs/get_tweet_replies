I mean, a 3.4 MILLION person protest his 2nd day in office?  He should try just being sane/polite for a week.
He's only been in office 8 days. Given that he already caused a Constitutinnal crisis, sure he'll deliver.
@SenateDems BS. These agitators didn't care when Obama BOMBED hundreds of civilian Muslims. They're just protesting PrezTRUMP.
Trump supporters had their protest on election day. It's the rest of the country's turn now.
We did. We won. Get over it. Pres. Golden Showers won't last 4 years.
Oh, you believe Goldenshowers that three million he lost by are illegal
You mean, thing in constitution? Doc. clearly limiting pres's powers?.
Even though the ban has nothing to do with faiths or backgrounds. And everything to do with safety.
safety? Bullshit. #Trump made America unsafe with this ban.
Is that something your cult leader Obama told you? You believe everything he says? Did he serve in the military?
did #Trump serve in the military?  No. He went to a military college.  He ducked the draft. He thinks he's smarter than generals
Kid, I have tons of military in my family including commanders. President Trump is listening to the right guys.
I'll leave this here.

I give credence to Petraeus' military background.   You?
Fuck Mother Jones.
you must go to the Betsy Devos school of readin and ritin to come up with that snappy comeback!
Vote No!
@inky_mark reminder here for me to add stop traffic post
You Dems keep supporting fringe groups and forget about working people and 2018 will be a disaster 4 Dems
Keep fighting as if our lives depend on it. Because they do. Make some noise. Raise a ruckus. Go!
Yep, you Dems better get in line with the people for a change.  We'll be coming with pitchforks!
Unless it is Christians, a man and woman, and you aren't a <insert demographic>. Any of those, you are just evil.
Great. Where was that America on Election Day?
Not sure what you mean.  74 million people voted against Trump.
I'm sorry, I don't think President Trump gives a shit about your irrelevant numbers. He won.
He actually seems to care very much about the #PopularVote. That's why he's doing the #VoterFraud witch hunt.
He just wants to make sure Russia didn't hack it, you know cause rigged elections
Really? What leads you to think that?
Well, the election is rigged until a republican says it might be rigged, then it is no longer rigged.
Are you from Russia?
Yeah, loved those George Soros professional signs.  World sees the corruption & knows POTUS will drain the swamp; Dems scared
This is not what America is about. America is working with our representatives to keep us safe in an orderly fashion.
Give 'em hell, Senator! Thank God I at least have one. @SenToomey, you'll want to get in on this if you want another term.
yes he'll be voting YES as Casey should if they want terms remember PAwent red 1st in18
PA *barely* went red, and only because a supreme court seat was more important than a dictator to them.
I'm sorry u r use 2Obama that was dictator this is a man of action that is completing his promises 2 ppl
Dictators follow through on promises. They don't work within their government's rules though.
too many ingredients spoil the broth....
thank you for working hard to get people to listen.
you lost my vote DO NOT REELECT BOB CASEY
keep standing strong! We need you to #resist
@SenWarren 
Thank you and the rest of the Dems who are opposing the fascist taking over America...even Nixon was more popular..

Listen to ExPresident obama!

Senator Casey, please vote against Gorsuch!  Keep the seat empty until a legitimate President can fill it.
Let's be very clear: You will filibuster & block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election.
this is what liberal idiots look Ike w/preprinted signs how could they know what 2say when no1 knew who it was Dont be an assl
☼ POWER TO THE PEACEFUL ☼ enact change asap b4 it's too late & we're too tired: treasonous Russian Hacking&taxforms
vote no on his SCOTUS pick.
GOP doesn't deserve S.Court choice. Illegitamate Presidency #russianhacking and changing the rules. How many times? Say No 
Not a scene. It's paid cry babies. We aren't dumb Mr. casey. We will remember your lies and obstruction next year!
This was a staged and planned demonstration. Someone blew a whistle on cue, and thus the protest. Soros is good at organizing
You've voted yes on FOUR of these awful people. Start protecting PA, or just switch parties.
@jackjoh01219520 Reading most of the comments attached to this post breaks my heart, wake up America beforeit is too late
We are fighting back as hard as we can, please be more vocal & fight with more emotion. Only what people understand
are u fucking kidding me?  America is screaming at u clowns to stop this madness.  We will remember it in two years,promise
... unless you are an atheist, in which case you stand alone.
Incredible scene here at the Supreme Court. This is what America is about- standing together for all faiths, families, and backgrounds. 
Yeah the crowd is standing together. Duh. Should Trump supporters also march? Guarantee Trumps crowd is larger. #wastetime
@tedcruz @SpeakerRyan @PressSec @Reince Yet Ted, Ryan, & Reince take a victory lap & Spicy will lecture protesters tomorrow NUT
@DEBRACLINTON The America I know

Stay the course, fight the good fight and we shall overcome
Continue to protect religious freedom in  USA - thanks!
.@SenBobCasey Send the jihadist refugees to your gated community; leave the rest of us alone.
credibility? Take care of your pharmaceutical connections then I might listen to you.
Thank you for standing up for what is right!
thank you for protecting democracy and equality before the law #NoBanNoWall
This is my America! Not the America of cringing cowards who'd sell the soul of the country for "security" and turn on neighbors
You know what else would be an incredible scene? Democrats forcefully opposing all Trump's rancid cabinet picks. @BFostersbox
As best they can...
I support you!
@SenateDems Dems are imploding, all you do is spew hate at your marches! The hole is getting deeper! We see you as ANARCHIST!
#stopsessions #StopPresidentBannon
America is not about this. Terrorist.
@scotusreporter The SCOTUS will be destroyed by the Dictator-In-Chief Bannon and his puppet Tyrant Frump.
Thank God the American people stand up! This is what America is! People for the People! Constitution needs to be upheld!

@SenateDems GET OVER IT!  You would have praised OBAMA if he had done it!!!
Many protesters are PAID! You ask them what they are protesting & they don't know! Wake up! ...and Yes, I'm a DEMOCRAT!
all most amerians see are intolerant american hate mongors who dont care about americas safety

@mebennui Yes it is & we will resist until @POTUS realizes what USA's values R & acts like a President 4 all the people #Resist

Trump is doing the right thing to protect this country. We had too many attacks to worry about a few inconvenienced people.
terrorist enabler.  Go to ground zero and say these things.
All dems need to be in the crowd want to show your with us that's how. Noted some H.of Rep and Sentator were not in the mix.

THANK YOU for all you do, Sen Casey!!
Thank you for your leadership! My family appreciates your dedication to fighting the administration's discriminatory policies.
Not a fucking peep in 2015 when democrats wanted immigration tightened. Fucking hypocrites.
given his profile, he must b loving it
Protesting because they refuse to accept their socialist utopia is being taken away.

We are curious what you can do for your constituents
the last paragraph states he is on their case.....
what happened to rule of law? Are we a nation of politics now? Trump gets to make up laws and force them on us?
This is our system of checks and balances?  #ImpeachTheMadKing #MondayNightMassacre
Please help save us from this autocratic narcissist. Keep the checks and balances. It has never been more important.
@MaddowBlog warms my heart to see that so many of us still remember what this country was built on. Keep it up
Now do more. Stop @SenatorSessions. The dictator #Drumpf is sacking his opponents in a play from Putin's book. #DoMore
Now AG has been fired for being ethical? When does this all go to SupCrt, if they even still exist since deleted off WH site?
I am a part of America, too. These protests have no real basis. We need to stop terrorists from coming in.

Sally Yates, acting Attorney General just fired by Trump! What the heck is going on?
Now, I'm terrified. Someone please save us from this coup.
Oh god.
maybe you could get the other Senator from Pennsylvania to slither out from under the Koch moneybags and take a look at this?
Keep it up! @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
Hope you say the same when the #NoDAPL heats up again.
America is also about freedom to choose a political side. Sad that we can't show respect to that freedom.
@MaddowBlog 
Maybe by Valentine's Day you'll have 300 million Americans in Washington DC.
Sallyyates was just hired by Trump. Spread the word there @SenWarren @SenMarkey  @chemoelectric
