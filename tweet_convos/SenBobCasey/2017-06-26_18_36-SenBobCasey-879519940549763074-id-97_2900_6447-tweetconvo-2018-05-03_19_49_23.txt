.@SenBobCasey just got here. He's telling the truth about the GOP health care bill. Calls it "obscene". 
If you missed this - sadly I did - the People's Filibuster is starting up again at 2pm today. Capitol steps.
Oh I hope they'll do it again Wednesday so I can get my ass down to DC while it's still covered! (ass, not DC)
The bill is not only obscene, it is an insult to every American and a reality check about our Congress and special interests & the wealthy.
The SENATE DEMS do make me proud @SenateDems @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris
They are lying to the gullible people that believe the trash they are spreading about the ACA & the GOP plan. Smoke screen for failing ACA!
Really? They're not the ones that drafted the bill by 12 Reblicans in the dark with no input from Democratics. Just a 2 hr vote
Nancy Pelosi said it best. Lets pass ACA will allow us to see what's in it. Over 2000 pages of wealth transfer from Middle Class!
Proud. Yes!
What wld make me feel proud wld b Dems supporting medicare 4 all.This is theater. Whenever opportunity 2 supp medicare 4 all they kill it.
@SenBobCasey is one hellof a guy.I'm proud to call him my Senator! He definitely represents his constituents,unlike evil corrupt @SenToomey
I don't have a senator in this fight, I'm from Az & stuck with Flake & McCain . For now!!
Flake is still on the fence. Your call can help convince him to vote No. 

602-840-1891
202-224-4521
Yes, kill millions of deserving citizens to further enrich the wealthy is beyond obscene. It's a financial con-job, not a health care bill.
Don't forget the great Senators from Hawaii! @SenBrianSchatz is fighting strong! Our best to @maziehirono who is having surgery!
Proud that @SenBobCasey is in the fight against BCRA(P). Sorry that @SenToomey is not standing with Pennsylvanians against this devastation.
Toomey makes $750 mil. if this passes. +$300k from lobbyists and +$400k from the tax cut. 1/2 our senators have sold their souls. Disgrace!
Thats my Senator @SenBobCasey and we are Proud to have him!
Democrats have HEART  ..... Lots of 

That is exactly what I'm talking about !! I'm pretty sure it's called compassion and values .....
Obama the traitor never shared your sentiments  he destroyed health care rammed it through the Republican ass and now you are proud?
I don't think anyone has read Green Eggs and Ham either. They actually have a substantive argument about facts and are trying to help us.
This was great. I watched for probably an hour last night. Made me proud to be a Democrat.
This is good for accessibility, should be more common. they should all start supporting a Universal Health Care plan of some sort
They do make me proud + I'm tired of everyone ragging on the Dems. They're working hard.
You're allowed to criticize your own party. In fact, it's the most democratic thing you can do.
That was amazing!
Bobby Casey? Truth ? 

Sanders slams 'unprecedented' process on GOP health bill that impacts  every American!" https://plus.google.com/107835312295887565713/posts/8mtjmHu9xPA … & https://plus.google.com/107835312295887565713/posts/MjFNGikKt7L …
They'll make me proud when they snatch up a few of those Republicans and throw them down those steps!
Yes, I'm so sick of the Democratic Party being in trouble talking point of the far right/left the cable new pundits and some weak kneed D's.
Democrats embrace the 'obscene',
The cowardly republicans cower and try to live another day. They can't defend their abomination. It's wealthcare and it's a waste of paper!
Thank you for tirelessly fighting!  Awesome! Feel the hugs from all of us who care about our disabled, kids, seniors & working Americans!
Now this is what fighting for democracy and all americans looks like.
Thank you @SenateDems!
I love my @SenBobCasey! Way to fight for us, sir!
Yes they are in the dark,very dark,dark!
Very proud. Thank you @SenateDems!
I feel discouraged republicans see dark and not light...those masses are shrouding the blinding light of common sense #democraticnightlight
Thanks for protesting with us and for us..@SenBobCasey ..   @senchuckschumer 
Keep up fighting we are with you!!
@debv219 I AM proud of all of our Democrats in Washington, they're extremely short handed but are fighting hard for us everyday
Thank you Senate Democrats
So proud to have Sen Booker rep NJ.  We have a crooked governor, some unsavory legislators, but Corey Booker  does us proud every day !
Oft unsaid: That slob is making tons/extra chaos/work for our Congress- robs time from normal stuff!
Not a closed 12 member Republicans holding secret meetings composing health Care bill and giving Democrats 2 hrs to pass or not.
That's MY senator!  I am a proud Pennsylvanian tonight.  Go @SenBobCasey ! #ProtectOurCare
@SenBobCasey: You're making a real difference! Thank you and your Dem colleagues for speaking truth and listening to people. #NEPAproud

Thanks God they are coming to their senses
" @TopherSpiro @metaquest @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBobCasey Americans Should Always Feel Pride 4 Those Who Stand Up 4 Them & Invite The Press! "
It was spontaneous.

@TheDemocrats Be specific.Give facts.Yes it's obscene &will kill,but drop drama & be clear. How much will people pay?What coverages r lost?
They do make me proud, I know they're fighting for us.
Me too!
Demented, DESPICABLE Republicans will all gets there's!

Stay the course,  PLEASE! ! We are all counting on you!
They are and they do.  For some, they are our only hope.  God bless.
So proud of the Dems! They need to do whatever they can (along with us) to #KillTheBill
I am proud, is this being televised on C Span?
I am immensely proud of @SenBobCasey ; @PatToomey, not so much
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley !!!
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenBobCasey How TF is this Bill still a thing? How is GOP approval rating not zero. What's wrong with people?
BOOM!
Thank you @SenateDems , for (literally) shining a light so democracy, and more Americans, can live on.

We are proud of our Dems!
@SenBookerOffice @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBobCasey 
Bravo, clap, clap, clap, Bravo!!!!!!
So Brave and wise!!! 
Ignore all the BS on cable news. Dems are here and standing up. I've never been more proud to be a democrat than in the last 6 months.
Thank you Senator Bob Casey and all of the other Senate Democrats who are fighting the gop health care bill!
By being obstructionist? Maybe they should try to come up with a new plan
Proud that you're my senator from PA. 
Wait. With cameras and on the record? Ive got to tell a few people about this. @SenSasse @SenatorFischer @PressSec @RepDonBacon @OWHnews
Thank you, @SenBobCasey. Imagine, a Senator who makes him/herself accessible. Don't take him for granted, PA'ians.
This PA Dem is VERY grateful for her one senator that actually cares.  #nottalkingtoomey
bob is my senator & i am very proud to have him represent me.
Why is this at night in the dark? Why not in the halls during the day??
Y did12 Republicans draft final bill in the dark and give Democrats 2 hrs to vote on it
Stand up for me too! I start Obamacare 7/1/17 
I wish I was there!
@SenBobCasey -listened to you on Cspan & everything you said was truth to power. thank you for distinguishing btw the health system and ACA
That's the back of my senator's head! Hi @CoryBooker! Thank you for fighting for Ethan!
And my guy @SenBobCasey fighting for my son
we'll be there on Wednesday. if i lived in D.C i wouldve been there as well. thank you, senators!
Believe they are at least they stand United and for the poeple
That's great, but what else are they doing? What about your suggestion of filibuster-by-amendment?
I know that @SenBobCasey was presented with a bunch of amendments by his constituents today. So hopefully this will happen.
I am proud of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand. They have really been leading the way.
This is how you do it !
Appropriate. It is a horror story in which many people will die.
Thank you for showing what democracy looks like!
