You are always complaining about health care and never have we seen try to work with GOP. So start working or shut up.
Literally every democratic sen has been trying to work with GOP on this for months. GOP shut out everyone
If they really wanted to they would. But all their names are on Obamacare too.
GOP wrote the entire bill in secret, most GOP weren't even allowed to see it. Dems asked to see it/help constantly. GOP refused
Wow! Just like Obamacare.
Nearly 200 amendments on ACA, weeks of senate hearings, debates. Obama came to both chambers to take questions on it. Stop lying.
It is truly obscene. Senator we are under attack from all sides now. PA House is now restructuring Medicaid to balance the state budget :(
@SenBobCasey I called my state Senator Ryan Aument and tried a Hail Mary tonight.  I  I don't lose my Medicaid--I will die without it.
Amy the State bill should hopefully not affect you. The big change is having families of disabled kids pay Medicaid premiums.
I hope not but I still let him know that harming children i.e. Kicking children off of Medicaid or messing with their coverage isn't Prolife
Exactly and any restructuring of Medicaid is a slippery slope. Fact that they are willing to raid Medicaid to balance budget is scary.
No program ever gets cut how did our founding fathers build this country with out a program
@ReggyMcdaniel I'm glad you don't know this topic.  I've worked with autistic children and they need every service that Medicaid provides.
People that need it not to get what they need
Do any of the republican senators realize how tragic this bill would be?
You do realize 18 of 23 coops failed the ACA.  I'd just let it fail and leave you naysayers up the creek!  Ask your illustrious Senator.
Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you have an elderly parent relying on Medicaid? Do you have a special needs child?
Time for single payer!!!
Who in hell is going to pay for it?  You forgot that....nothing is ever FREE!
When it comes to their Healthcare plan, Toomey and the GOP have just one thing to say to Americans: "Do you feel wealthy, punks?" #realPA
18 of 23 coops failed the ACA.  I'd let it fail and leave you holding the bag, punk!  Ask your Senator how O stole Bil$ to keep it afloat.
Talking points and tweets. Is that all you know @SenBobCasey ? I read your tweet on Obamacare repeal. Better idea. Full repeal. Period!
Thank you!
We need 2 create employment program that solves joblessness, while supplying health care as benefit. Think Job WPA, but with healthcare.
Vast majority of adults don't want free health care. They want, need, should work. Earning their health care rath r than having it doled out
When they can't work, collaborative partnership btween govt, business, faith orgs, local community, and individual needs to solve reasons y
Sorry ACA was obscene - no high ground.   Time to repel and permit free market options - no mandatory purchasing - I pick my coverage no you
It's also the tax plan but hey who's looking?
How about the working people? You have to go
Obscene is YOUR penchant to vote for any entitlement that #WeThePeople have to pay for. YOU voted for the o-care mess, now you whine.
Pope Francis says it all!
The Jesuit Pope knows nothing about paying for healthcare. Stay out of Gov. Fr, my envelopes pay to have you at the Altar not in the Tent.
OK.... What is You and @dnc's plan.
Because all I hear is whining and complaining... no solutions... no plans
10% of GDP now used to fund Medicare/caide would be used to fund voucher system.

3/4 Medicare/aide pts now covered thru same vouchers. Don't lose coverage. 

http://health.purpleplans.org 
2/4 Sicker individs get larger vouchers. Incentivize ins cos to compete for these patients. 

http://health.purpleplans.org 
1/4 American Single Payer System funded by govt vouchers to ins cos & healthcare still provided by private sector

Why don't you agree to look over the points of single payer Purple Health Plan if you TRULY think AHCA is obscene?

http://health.purpleplans.org 
100% premium increases, debt spiral and job killing #Obamacare is obscene. So is supporting planned parenthood
The middle class are already paying obscene costs in deductibles and premiums due to OCare.  What are you doing about that?
Little different than your plans hey Bob. You handout freebies to the poor and have the middle class pay for them.
More jobs!
thanks for continuing to work for average honest Americans and not just fat cats on Wallstreet who will benefit most from this
Bob you screwed us sp much over the last 8 years what a lier
You don't need tax cuts because your money comes from your trusts. Oh wait, how did that money come about??? #fastestswimmerclub
We are entitled to nothing. We must work not take handouts.
Senator Casey
It is time u hang up your cleats. Please don't run for another term.
BTW, as a mechanic, I don't fix things that aren't broken. But apparently you DemocRATS do. That's why we have Obamacare in the first place.
How about tax cuts for people that pay 90 percent of the taxes does that sound bad
Keep up the great job Mr Casey and keep us pa voters informed
Could you please get back to work already ... do you do anything other than piss and moan Bobby? Remind me again what we are paying you for?
You have nothing no original ideas just obstruction you're pathetic
Same old same old. Just play a tape recording next time.
Senator tell your constituents the truth! Can't provide insurance if udon't have insurance insurers. Time to stop playing with their health.
The GOP does not even have a final plan yet!  Stop scaring people!
.@SenCoryGardner Are you really going to do this??!
We (all americans) should have the same healthcare that the senate has
The plan is really no plan.  This is a blatant tax grab for the 1% ers
Shut ewer trap politician 
tax cut plan $5 TRILLION ($70,000/taxpayer).  Middle class gets only $200/yr.  Wealthy gets balance. But you may get a raise at your job.
@SenToomey Duh.  Further proof.  We know why Sen Toomey likes the plan.
Your lack of effort to improve healthcare and insurance options for the people of PA outside of "Casey campaign mode" is what is obscene!
I'm SO proud to have you for my senator.  Thank you for being an ongoing voice of reason in an otherwise insensitive Senate.
Casey and apnews are socialists. They want to control you and your health care. Can you imagine not being able to take your dying son home?
What we need and deserve is #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #HR676 #PublicOption We want what we pay for for You and your family! Say NO 2 ahca
Seniors deserve and need #MealsOnWheels (by the way we had to pay for my grandmother's. But still a necessary humane service.
Thank you for having ethics and a sense of compassion.
@SenToomey has none. He's a disgrace.

Horrible governing. Money for the rich and unaffordable coverage for pre existing conditions. Got cancer? Oh well. #savetheaca
If that is true,we NPA will remove GOP in 2018 for sure.
Plz Don't Do This! Will the rich miss their  more than my family misses ME? I have lupus & me & millions more will DIE! #TheResistance
They should be held liable for one person dying do to their negligence
It IS obscene.  

#Resist It is after all the Republican way.
Baloney!
Thank you for keeping attention on the horrid @GOP HC plan. We can't let it get lost in the crush of new info about #TrumpRussiaCollusion.
Truth. It's feels like a serious juggling act.  What we're trying to protect is that important, and so at risk right now.
This is the main reason McConnell and Ryan will keep ignoring 45 and family's  ̶n̶e̶a̶r̶  treasonous behavior: Hurting the poor and tax cuts
If no tax cut for middle class,GOP can kiss good by in 2018 in both houses.
Any chance you actually work to solve the program.....or just keep bitching on Twitter?
I'm pretty sure we all get tax cuts.  It just seems like the rich are getting a bigger break because they pay more.  It's math.  Learn it
WRONG. The tax breaks are for the wealthy who will not have to pay into the system.
show me the line that states rich people won't have to pay taxes, also show me why rich people are responsible for my healtcare.

I am appalled.
indeed it is .....screw you !! @GOP @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @VP
