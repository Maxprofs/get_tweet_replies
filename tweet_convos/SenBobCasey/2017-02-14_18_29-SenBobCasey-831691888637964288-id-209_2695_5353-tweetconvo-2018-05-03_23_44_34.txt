Intercepted calls show Trump campaign members had repeated contact with Russian intelligence before the election http://nyti.ms/2kvdm5O 
@Glorygirlone we should scrap the whole administration and redo the election.
We agree.
How far down the Trump line do we need to go to stop the cancer?Where is the root?? Someone please find it soon.
No kidding! Someone get some weed killer!
Sen.,please lead the fight to keep America a Democracy.
I think Trump had a lot of ppl fooled!
The voters wanted a change/not this change,but he fed that need well.Fooled millions.
yes, even my parents were hooked by his phony promises.
@owingso 

Let's be clear. Russia didn't "meddle" in our election. Putin feared @HillaryClinton & conspired with Trump to win.
Putin played Obama like a fiddle and would have played HRC even better
In ur dreams abt HRC. HRC pragmatic, experienced leader. Trump? Poor judgement shows
so you're ok with allowing 4 Americans to die and then lying about it? And the list goes on
Back @ u w DT's botched Yemen attack. U shld b more worried abt DT colluding w Putin
perhaps you'll want to tell that to the soldiers who actually protect you?
Don't have 2...have career military & vets in family. They aren't cray like ur acting
I'm acting cray because I disagree with you? Thought Dems taught tolerance. They dont
Definitely..I don't understand why every citizen wasn't up in arms immediately.They better catch up now if they aren't yet.
if there is anyone in history that should be locked up for treason; it is Trump! How can the R stay blind to this?
our country is literally at stake with this man in charge! It's been a month we have had more issues with this man then last 8!
it's amazing to watch them subvert our laws and institutions to gain power and break American spirits! Crazy
please keep going
@BadLuckBuffy - Damn right!!! MY Senator!!
Lucky!! 
. Not really; if Senator Casey is our Senator, then we also reluctantly have to claim Toomey. :(
- Can I put my fingers in my ears and sing "La la la la la"??
Ohio has Rob Portman but we also have John Kasich as governor. 
@RabbiJill we must demand a full third party investigation, impeachment ending in removal and new elections
@Eagfan20 they seem to be afraid oh 45
*of
So, ya'll get with it. Be vocal and demand the truth for the American people! Please! My senators wont do squat! Save us from tyranny!
Most of your colleagues are too busy covering their own asses. Russians hacked RNC servers too. The more you know.
@UniteBlue Bob, we're counting on you.
WHAT "meddling?" No one has provided even the slightest shred of evidence of any "meddling."

You're just a liar.
i wonder if he'd quit if he was offered $20b.. wouldn't be shocked if that would do it.
you or your colleagues didn't say a thing when Obama was caught on a hot mic colluding w/ Russian before the 2d election ?
You seem to have forgotten that Obama had people go to Russia before his election too, Bob. No need to investigate that?
this is all going to lead to #ROSNEFT 19% 11B .. all about donny being rich, nothing else really matters to him.
#Scumbag
Thank you, Senator Casey!  Keep pressing this.  Don't give up...we need your leadership.
Right. Independent nonpartisan investigation. Now!!!
Do 500,000 of us need to bash down the front door of the Capital before they get the picture?
because the Times is so credible?
I know you'll continue to follow in your father's footsteps, Sen Casey, and do the right thing. I am a registered Republican.
then can you do your constituents a favor and ask PA Congressman @RepMeehan why he voted against releasing 45's tax returns.
@realDonaldTrump
@SenateDems 
@SenateGOP
@HouseDemocrats 
@HouseGOP
@SenateMajLdr
We want enabling GOPs to go to prison too!!
Well said.  Thank you Senator Casey!
#Pence lied to US he knew what #Flynn said to #Russia #GOPDontCare about US #TrumpPenceIllegitimate #Impeach
Can't. Agree. More.
thank you for your attention to this problem
#MAGA understand our country's safety is compromised Isis is one thing but having Russia all up in our business is insane!!!
You guys have double standards which are causing us harm, just because Hillary lost, and your hate for Trump is harming the US.
umm...
did you read the article senator?
Bernie has been called for the investigation. finally all congress Democrats are on board?
Thank you!
Senator if you wana throw ur hat in the ring for 2020 u gotta do more than tweeting
Thank you!
#MakeItCount now!
wheres the evidence that they meddled in the election? There is none.
@ILoveBernie1 
HRC LOST partly bc she's an awful cand who's a liar & partly bc dnc rigged dnc primary.  I didn't even vote4 DT.
"Rattle, Rattle" If you Democrats worked with Republicans the last 8 yrs, no before I was born this crap shouldn't happen. On U
Thank you @SenBobCasey for taking a stand and listening to your constituents! We appreciate you!

thank you please keep shining the light on this mess! @SenAlexander @SenBobCorker should do the same
Yes it should. Fr those who care more about America than their party. Talking to you, GOP!
You had no concern over Hillary's deleted emails, uranium sale, that is true story, why people are turning on demoncrats!
Good luck with your Republican colleagues. Your best hope is McCain.
Remember, for some reason, Obama decided to get serious about Russia & put sanctions on after election. After 8 year silence?
And get rid of the rat's nests in the bureaucracy. It's reported Obama's people like Ben Rhodes set up the road blocks.
3. Not just Trump but his top aidesâ€“Cohen, Schwarzman and Kushner all did shady big $ deals @calisota91
1. Just discovered: Trump with Putin pal Leviev (did $295M deal with Jared Kushner) who blames sanctions on Russia for hurting his business 
Also into Hillary State department. PA will serve another upset with you. ;)
I implore you to act loudly on our behalf. Stop the niceties, Dems need to be savage in defending our nation.
Trying to remain hopeful but this is disheartening and demoralizing. I want to see Drumpf's taxes. Follow the money.
Do not attempt CIA/Leftist Dem coup! The people will rise against you. Blood will run deep!
- Unfortunately, *SHOULD* is an operative word for the #GOP. They should LOVE America & ALL it's ppl: But they DON'T.
the Russians could have come here and returned Hillary's little toy from Staples and she still would have lost. Work on jobs.
AND Comey's decision NOT to investigate or mention this before the election, unlike other things...
@UniteBlue Thank you Senator Casey. #trueblue
The Guardian (I believe) reported on this months ago. We should have listened to our allies.
Key word is "independent".
also need taxes to be released !   Good job Sen!
.@SenBobCasey #trumpgate #impeach! Guess it never pays to put down our @CIA @FBI eh, @POTUS ?! #crosscheckscam
let's hope GOP get their heads out of the sand!! #Trumprussia #TrumpTreason
Sen. Casey, please push for trump's taxes to be released. Vote by GOP extremely disheartening. They know he's hiding something
when does the investigation begin??? Just a lot of talk now
"no evidence"  you dolt.
Thank you for your courage#keep pushing.
More importantly, once the contents of these calls are released we will know everything they colluded on.
CUCK
Pretty pitiful R own Govt isn't doing the investigative work, instead relying on the Press! #ThankGod4FreePress
So, @SenBobCasey & @nytimes, the #FBI knew of #russiagate BEFORE #JamesComey, announced the pre-#election #hillaryEmails red herring?
@cathys808 As a US Senator, please tell us what you intend to DO about it. We're past the time for talk, get it rolling!
You mean the election that we should have been smart enough to know they were meddling in? THAT election? #ShameOnUs #FAkeNews
everything Trump has done should be overturned!
you need to do a #CongressionalWalkout ALL OF YOU until they agree to it @kharyp
@NewtownAction how any true patriot can let these crooks liars traitors tear our country apart we are better than this 
Russian Spy's. That's what we are dealing with now.
@mc_christi1  We need all of Senate and all of Congress to stand together and represent the people, as all were elected to do.
I'm tired of party over country. We have to force this issue
@ShaunKing They will not, I think Russia is blackmailing our government. We've been taken over
This is what you get when you call a news organization "failing", repeatedly.  Karma will bite you in the arse.
Pray tell, HOW would Russia effect the results of the elections insofar as election vote counting machines are CLOSED CIRCUIT?
@amylynnyoga resignation Bob, not investigation. Resignation was the word you were looking for.
@ShaunKing - If GOP ignores, we have to question their allegiance.
@SerenaMurillo Please review yours procedures and Articles of Impeachment
When are you going to call for an investigation into the @DNC and media trying to rig our elections?
Remember @realDonaldTrump starting his campaign saying OUR Politicians are STUPID! Was he correct? Its time for an ERECTION.
Than do it. The regime and the Republicans are not going to do anything.
Thank you for your service in continuing to demand answers.
@RNixonZombie @nytimes So what're you gonna do?
any chance you can talk to @SenToomey about this?  He still seems to think his constituents are "paid protestors". Thank you!
@NicAndrews So what's stopping you from doing it?
@jenerallyspeaks Slow down Bob, back in your wheel chair
@ShaunKing @nytimes I'm not super following all this but didn't the NSA just resign for this exact thing?
. @SenBobCasey @ShaunKing Except it won't, because the @GOP Congress comprises a bunch of spineless, craven earthworms.
@SenSanders @SenWarren @DrJillStein @SenJohnMcCain @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein @SenFranken Release @realDonaldTrump tax returns!
How do we force tax return release?
Bob o bob. Sorry bud we have spoken.
@ShaunKing @nytimes Finally Dems are ready to stand up. We need you 2 represent the ppl. The nation must be protected.
.@SenBobCasey what about the proven meddling the DNC did in the democrat primary? Why no investigation into that?
If McConnell, Ryan & Chaffetz won't move forward, not only is it party over country, you have to wonder if they are compromised
the electoral college is suppose to protect us from these occurances.  More govt wearing party hats and not working
@ShaunKing how understated!
you are my senator Bob. We will dink beers one day.
Invite me please
How about a call for all of Congress to start impeachment proceedings?!
I am calling for the immediate resignation of @potus and @vp #Flynnghazi
@kharyp ...we are counting on you representing PA and American Bob!
US HOUSE MEMBERS...get Trump's taxes now.
@CAGoldenBear 
I wish I could be more positive but really, don't you know these congressmen already know yet protect trump
@Dyke67ny Yes it should and I hope to see you tweet the process has started. This should include Ryan&Mitch
Is that why Obama barely said anything b4 election? Using security moles for poltical blackmail Surprises en route
@djomonde3296 #Trump's own words during the campaign, "rigged election", he knew then and he knows now. Yet no one believed him
not with a Republican dominated Congress.
#FightFakeNews
@Dialectic4Dufi anyone associated with Trumps campaign can't investigate themselves #doyourjob #TheResistance #NoBanNoWall
: Thank you for defending USA. Push for bipartisan investigation. Time for GOP to decide: loyal to USA, or the Trumpists.
Thank you, Senator Casey.
And then we laughed and laughed...c'mon Bob, you've worked with the GOP long enough to know that ain't happening.
@PrincessBravato go get 'em! PA is right behind you @SenBobCasey !!
@PrincessBravato Let's have a #doOver
@PrincessBravato aside from election meddling what's up with Americans who aren't spies speaking to Russian intelligence.
Keep up the pressure. The survival of our democracy requires it (Unpleasantly dramatic, but true.)
@RepCummings @GOP needs to support @MaxineWaters' bill for an independent investigation committee into 45's ties to Russia.
Maxine Waters is as crazy as they come
investigate investigate!
Senators that don't act will be voted out! Nixion impeachment should be clear history!
@CORYROZAY Obama tells Russia's Medvedev more flexibility after election
can we start impeachment hearings tomorrow? The whole administration is complicit. This is a constitutional crisis.
I want Trump & his aides charged & arrested for treason
.@SenBobCasey <--Seems like you are another Pelosi fake news type
Why isn't the headline: "Officials Say No Evidence of Cooperation Betw Trump campaign and Russia"- as story states. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share â€¦
Kinda makes his day 2 "patriots day" shit, all the more disgusting than it already was. I'm physically ill over this.
I'm afraid the White House has been compromised Senator Casey.
Will you please get eyes and ears?
Keep the pressure and spotlight on this investigation. Republicans can't  ignore this..  American values must be a priority.
It not a report. It's a news article from a biased paper with a misleading headline.
Wow... This is one dirty administration. They all need to go. Trump is the leader. Follow the money trail, it will tell all.
@1RealGirlWriter Senator Casey, you are absolutely correct but how can this be done when the @GOP puts Party above the nation?
You act like the Dems don't? Get real
Anyone who doesn't is likely complicit or compromised.
The republicans let this happen...they participated whole heartedly.  They are just as culpable.
All the more reason to have an independent select committee b/c this is going far & wide.
and this should serve as a call to investigate the leaks that came out! Why do you want to ignore the legality of the leaks???
i dont think revealling Clinton  was a corrupt bitch in her emails counts as interfering in the election
Must be true CNN says so
Looks like pizza gate, too good to be true.
@BactiveorBquiet Come on GOP time to put country over party
It isn't their party they stand for, it's their power. #donotreelectpowerhungrylegislators

Thank you, @SenBobCasey. Your constituents appreciate your diligence! Please keep it up!
right.. intercepted calls..
Can Director Comey be investigated too? It seems suspicious to me that he was eager & willing to compromise Secretary Clinton.
Excellent job Mr. Casey. Any location on @SenToomey yet? He's still MIA. We should do a #welfarecheck
If it weren't for those meddling Russian kids, Mother would have won the election
as the leak is a criminal action, are you advocating aiding & abetting?
Obama okayed listening in on trumps campaign telephone calls did they have a warrant
I'm from the Wilkes-Barre area. Will u ever run for President?
thank you. Impeach the #traitorsnwhitehouse
gotta love liberals ignoring intelligence leaks to the press for political gain
Keep pushing for an independent investigation, senator! The American public will accept morning less
The @GOP just looks guilty themselves by refusing.
what about Obama meddling in protests against this country. ..what shameful behavior. ..organizer  shame
as long as you want to investigate Russia, let's dig into Hillary's plutonium sale
Doug: get past the #fakenews.  1) It was uranias, not plutonium. 2). A Company in Toronto owned the Company whp
don't let GOP be a part of it they seem to want to hide something that they don't want us to know they will try to hinder truth
are you going to blame your loss in 2018 on the Russians too.  It's funny the democrats really tough on Russia now.
keep the pressure on the republicans don't do any business until they address these issues this is bull shit happening now.

Keep speaking up and standing up for America, Senator Casey!  We appreciate it and we'll remember in November!
focus on the Sudden readiness of Russian forces in Europe, that's end of the worldly important not some dumb Phone call
really the New York Times is your source. Lol let's not worry about the Russian jets buzzing our ships.
What an extreme embarrassment 45 and his cronies R 2 the USA--YET so many ppl follow them all blindly + make excuses 4 them. 
keep at it, sir. Thanks for your hard work!
Why did Comey choose to pursue HRC emails when this Russia/Trump story was unfolding. Story has many tentacles.
But what about Obama and his flexibility?
at this point, I'm not even surprised
The NYT is a garbage newspaper not fit for tp
we're counting on you!
more concerned about the leakers, and the serious crimes that involves, not a stupid dog chase down an empty bunny hole!
And to what extent the Trump campaign participated in Russian interference!
please keep pressing hard about reports like this. It's important to be vigilant at times like this. Keep up the great work!
start screaming
the bigger investigation should be why is the government spying on citizens and then leaking informatio
