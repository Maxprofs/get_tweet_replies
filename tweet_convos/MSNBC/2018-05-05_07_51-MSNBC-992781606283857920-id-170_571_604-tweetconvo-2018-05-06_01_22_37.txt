Wow..no wonder he made know effort to even acknowledge there peaceful march... Rally..
The NRA has been around since 1871, defending something that has been part of the US Constitution since 1791. YOU and YOUR OPINION just GOT HERE. As more #2A sellouts plague the US government, the NRA fights to keep those who are FOR the #2A 
.
#ShallNotBeInfringed
Fact check: The NRA was founded to promote marksmanship for Northern soldiers.

Had nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment.
"The NRA has been around since 1871, defending something that has been part of the US Constitution since 1791."
.
Learn. To. Read.
You really are an idiot....read your own statement...you are saying they have been defending the 2nd amendment since 1871~~ which is NOT true!!
You CLEARLY ARE stupid, so I'll go REALLY SLOW this time.
.
The NRA has been around since 1871 FUCKING COMMA defending something that was PART OF something that was there since 1791. I never said the NRA has been defending the 2nd Amendment since 1871.
Ok...if you didn't say that....what exactly have they been defending since 1871?? What was that PART OF.....since 1791??
They're not defending ANYTHING since 1871. They HAVE BEEN around since 1871.
I think trump needs the money to pay his legal fees and probably to pay off "others" to keep them quiet while he continues to deceive the American people. That's also why his base is so important to him, their money that helps pay his legal fees. What are PACs for????
How much did planned infanticide spend on hillary?
how much did nbc spend on saving joy's career?
Off topic, nice try
how much did the nra spend on democratic candidates?
Maybe the reason Russia support the NRA is they hope every American buy a weapon in we shoot each other.  Why would they support open carry laws for us and not for themselves.
Sounds like something CROOKED, CRAZY, LYING DONALD WOULD DO!!!
Its all about the money for Trump
It's always about the money, isn't it? Lives lost to gun violence, no big deal with this Admin. @gop GOP No comment. #VoteThemOut
In 2016 alone unions gave democrats more than 300 million to democrats, that's more than the nra has given in total in the last 20 years to republicans
Do about planned parenthood:p she will not do coz she is a slave of democrats.
Again, even with Koch Brothers, Cambridge Analytica, putin, voter suppression, Gerrymandering, etc. HRC got 3million more votes than trump. Were it not 4a democracy that's anything other than "1man1vote" thanks 2electoral college, America wld have a legitimate POTUS!
No wonder his hands are tied. They own him.
Amount of free thinking Americans believing your facts. Zero 0
So what? How much did Planned Parenthood spend supporting Hillary?
How much of that money came from Russia. The @NRA @NRATV @DLoesch @DomRasoJr @GOP @FoxNews @foxandfriends all work for @PutinRF_Eng including that dirt bag @seanhannity ALL FOREIGN AGENTS
Damn. Brain on off mode. Perpetually.  This man has no idea what he’s talking about people.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT
Trump has been bought and paid for by Russia and big lobbyist.
And how much of that $30 million was provided by Russians?
Boycott this homophobic and racist Joy
How's the hack investigation going, did you realize that Joy is the hack
Propaganda joy
That's all? Maybe next time they can give more, what with all the new members. Thanks to D Hogg. #NRA #2ADefenders #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat
TRUMP Derangement  Syndrome may be FATAL proceed with CAUTION
Amount spent for republicans through nra contributions through the last 20 years, 200 million. Amount unions paid alone to contribute to democrats in the 2016 elections, more than 300 million
Russian dollars
Criminal. Lock him up!
It’s ridiculous that even russian porn may have effected our 2016 election.
How much of that 30 million was donated by the Russians. It's all ready been shown that Russia donated to the NRA.
In our country this would mean: responsible for every bullet in every innocent body. Life in prison.
Joy, why you throw bait to the bots? You know they're gonna swarm all over this tweet.
NRA
SHAME
this number is inflated nice try trying to lie about this.
and that money came to the NRA from Russia...who had given them $54,000,000 the NRA gave $30,300,000 of it to Trump the rest they spread out amongst other politicians
That’s disgusting!
That's very little in the scheme of things. $100s of millions has been spent by planned Parenthood
Amount of people who care what you think or say=0%
Russian donors> Torshin and his assistant Maria Butina/ though Russia does not allow gun ownership! Torshin and Butina started org, The Right To Bear Arms/ which gave them legitimacy to hang with NRA 
Did Don, Jr meet Maria Butina in Alaska last year when he dumped Secret Service
what did you spend it on?
Yep. A screwdriver made from silly putty.
An investigation is needed - wake up Congress!
Amount spent by Planned Parenthood to support HRC in 2016??
@amjoyshow BOYCOTT @NRA
Wow, that's 230 PSU's
(porn-star-units).
Planned Parenthood, which is directly responsible for killing lives, donated $20 million of taxpayer money to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016.  The NRA is not tied to killing lives.  The NRA is protecting our Constitutional rights and doesn't use taxpayer money.

and most of the $30 mill came from the Russians
corrupt Mueller investigation in excess of 7M dollars to unseat a duly elected president. MSNBC cheering the coup attempt. They're upset the woman they propped up didn't win. Russia helped but she didn't explain the electoral process to them when she asked for their help.
Planned parenthood killed how many last year and how much did they contribute homophobe
How much taxpayer $$ did planned parenthood donate to clinton and dems?
While using Russian money no doubt. FIRE PRUITT
How much Russians spend on Clinton Foundation?
NRA donations are not tax dollars. Unlike Planned Parenthood’s donations to the Democratic PAC’s, which come from political actions.  CORRUPTION
The NRA has lost focus on its mission. I can think of 2 guys rolling over in their graves,  Reagan & Heston!
How much is given by Planned Parenthood to The DNC? That is the question we need answered!
Gun manufacturers fund the @NRA, who in turn buy stooge politicians like @realDonaldTrump. The key is #CampaignFinanceReform. Corporate $$ has destroyed the political landscape. Corps ARE NOT people. Introduce reform. That is where the real change will come. #BanTheNRA
NRA does not support people killing. How much was spent supporting the baby killers, like Planned Parenthood?
And you know what?  He’s still an immoral idiot. Money doesn’t change that.
Amount Planned Parenthood is spending in only 8 States for the mid terms : $20 million.
# killed by the NRA = 0
Rather NRA than PPA
Liar liar sleeveless pantsuit on fire as Rose Ann would say!!!!!
Boycott the Joy Reid show let it be known that Dems and Conservatives will no longer tolerate the double standard that the MSM perpetuates daily without forgiveness to the people they on a daily basis destroy
Thank you and we love the support it’s truly great and keeps you losing Joy how wonderful that is
Let’s see you post how much Drmocrats spent trying to rig the election in Hillary’s favor. I’d wager you won’t touch that, hypocrite.
Thanks NRA for the help defeating  the Criminal Clintons!
#looser trump #fake president
Russian money laundered thru the NRA?

Amount Russia donated to NRA to elect Trump...$20 million
@politico_z how much Russian$$ NRA many ppl asking
#AMJoy
#AMJoy very curious
After months of denials, the NRA finally admitted it received money from 23 Russian-linked sources

https://shareblue.com/nra-russian-funding-ron-wyden/ …
Rubles.
5 million members, so presumably, they each gave him $6.00? What is the devil's number?
I want to support Trump. How much for 1 bullet?
How much money has #PlannedParenthood spent to keep the failed #democrat party@in congress? Show that number please
Few interested in ALL the facts anymore, just those that support their own agendas/narratives. 

And to think PP using taxpayer $$ to buy its influence. whole system (both/all sides) of financial support buying politicians sucks.
“I don’t take any money” he kept saying

Can you identify one NRA member that was involved in a mass shooting?  I will wait ...

Let's focus on other news ...

North Korea plans to release prisoners before summit meeting.

Unemployment at an historic lows.

Black male support doubles this week. 

#MAGA
How is he going to ban guns with this. Not possible
Considering it cost about $1 Billion to run for President $30 Million or 3% is not that much $
Lying Joy! This is the list of biggest political donors . The largest called farh llc, the hedge fund  bankers fr Wall Street , all of its $100 millions to Dem.
The NRA like PUTIN absolutely LOVE an Obedient PuppetAllegedly , Although I think the NRA must have hit a Clearance Sale
I can tell she didn't tweet this, it doesn't have the slurs and spelling errors.
PP donates well over $30mil and kills a million babies a year...but hey guns are the problem.  Let's not look at root causes like the value of human life.
Amount spent by Muslims in support of Hillary $65M.  At least NRA are US citizens.
Don’t forget it’s mostly Russian money.  NRA are traitors.
#fakenews
And a lot of it came from Russia. Illegal! #MAGA fools!
This results in no Gun Controls such contributions help NRA to use legislative agenda of congress.Trump is not only recipient. America still has major Gun Violence despite background checks just like illegal immigration problems.Trying to build walls but not address issues. Is it
wrong to address this issue and bring serious control to save lives amongst which any American can be the victim ? It is not the question of " Rights but Lives ". When has Right become above Life ? Just watch the following stats what Gun violence has done to innocent lives. Just
monitor this record which is up dated and by midterm election just answer for your self if you will let this opportunity slip away.  Our school kids have started this revelation support them. They dont have the votes but you do. It is your conscious must decide and the politics.
of left or right. Let emotion be put aside and reason if it is not time to make the right move. Be the judge and the jury. Pres Trump says this violence should continue what do you say on election day.
http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/sites/default/files/toll.png?ts=1523206708#.WspV9q0Rp2o.twitter …
During Trump's NRA speech he seized on comments from Federal Court Judge T.S. Ellis reinforcing Trump's argument that Mueller's aim is to hurt Trump. Guess he didn't want to acknowledge that Ellis also said "The American people feel strongly about no one having unfettered power."

And how much money does the killing organization @PPFA give to politicians
Damn,that’s all Putin gave him.Sold the Presidency cheap..but I guess we are a third rate country now anyway..so I guess 30m is fair.
now do PP
They’re not interested in actually educating, just trying to tear down “the opposition”...
Wow look at that ego
How much of that money came from Russian sources?  Was this money "laundered" money from Russian oligarchs via the NRA?  I think yes.
#LMAO  Owned & Operated by the @NRA  he's a pathetic TOOL.
@MSNBC Page and Baker resigned right before the IG report comes out! That's breaking news dear pseudo news channel.

Can you identify one NRA member that was involved in a mass shooting?   I will wait 

#fakenews
Just about the same amount he has spent playing golf during his presidency I say. He is lazy and clueless. Just my opinion
Yeah, he's lazy spends most of his time watching TV.

@CNN  @FoxNews Trump is a puppet for the NRA...Whatever the NRA wants Trump will jump...they pull the strings... He lies in the face of the survivors of Florida about tougher gun control... HE IS A PRESIDENT THAT CAN’T BE TRUSTED
WHICH WAS MONEY DONATED TO THE NRA BY THE FREAKING RUSSIANS

How much is that in rubles?
You mean Traitor trump didn't finance his  campaign? Oh that's right. Between Mercer + Russian/NRA  that's a big NO. He bellowed at every rally that he didn't need big donors cuz he's so rich. They still believe that lie+send him .Trump has been living on Vlad's for years.
Yes, that is what I have been thinking. I have heard Trump is not as rich as he claims, so where did he get the money he started his campaign with? Unreported campaign funds?
Prove It?
Where do they get all this money if they only have 5 million members?! Russians, gun manufacturers? Aren’t they a non-profit?
Bought and paid for

Wow.

What the fuck, @NRA?…
That all you go, You most like one of the Biggest Homophobe on the planet you hear something and decide to run with it, Give it up not working
How many times did Russian bots retweet you?

Trump insists no evidence of collusion.

Clinton said he didn't get a BJ.…
I’m thoroughly disgusted 
Russian $$

AND THE MOST SPECIAL PART - They wrote his speak for him !

Wow.

What the fuck, @NRA?…
how about this 1 Joy, Americans didn't see their check up during his 8 years tenure
Drain the swamp to create a #GOPCesspool
OMG y’all are so worried about this mans imperfect life but what about yours. Do you have all your stuff straight
Out of control! That is outrageous! That should not be allowed! When will enough be enough? #IllegitimatePresident #ImpeachTrumpNow
#KillTheNRANotOurKids

And how much is @MSNBC paying you in support homophobic speech?

National Russia Alliance

What fighting your inner Homophobia

WILBUR ROSS (BANK of CYPRUS), JARED, IVANKA & DEUTSCHE BANK WERE WASHING RUSSIAN MONEY AFD & NITE.
When Joy talks about how much money NRA invested in Trump ! I think back to him bragging about how much money he did not spend!  Let’s talk about health the President snorts allot and his waist is boarding obese.  Since Donald buys people,spins lies and probably,and cons.
We need a physical “do over”
We don't trust Obama's dr? Soooooo does that mean the dr lied about Obama too?
Really, BUT, Democrats Spent over $1 Billion on Obama in 1 Election Cycle making $30 Million, "Chump Change" as Chuck Schumer is fond of saying !!
Proof??
May I just say one thing?
I hate this corrupt man!
I bet Trump got another check for 3million from NRA again after his groveling he did on his hands and knees for them. Trump is nothing but a sell out for the biggest amount of .
We need a David to take down Goliath. By Goliath I mean these powerful organizations that back Trump.

And the @NRA got a lot of it from wealthy Russians:
NRA, In New Document, Acknowledges More Than 20 Russian-Linked Contributors
Anybody done the math on how much tRUmp got from the sale of a gun?

Payback time!
How much $ came from Russians?
It wasn't NRA money, it was Russian money.
There are legitimate reasons to own firearms. 
90% of the 2nd amendment crowd do not have them.
Trump, the GOP and the NRA have created a RADICALIZED conservative element in the country.
#AMJoy
All of my guns were handed down to me by relatives. That is how most people in America get their guns
Nice, we need to double that in 20....

TRUMP has PAUL RYAN

Washing his Russian Blood Rubles

....
Amount that was donated by Russia? 

$28 million

The Manchurian Candidate Donald Trump
You just make that up on the spot or did someone from media matters give you that number? Lol. Incredible how people still believe the collusion fairytale after all that’s come out about Hillary funding the dossier & comey blatantly lying under oath about the investigation.
That's the number I figured it to be!
Ahah! So you just made it up on the spot. It must be nice to live in a mindset where thoroughgoing idealism becomes reality.
The real question is how much of that money came from Russia.
Don't fall for #fakenews
Your media outlet likes to sow the seeds of hatred and divisiveness.

Over $1.2 billion was spent to defeat and belittle Trump ... he won anyway.   He spent far less running for office then his opponents.

Side note,  he accomplished more in 15 months then Obama did in 8 years.
Every single word of that tweet was a diversion from the argument. Even the off topic, dumb shit you replied with was laughable when given context. Are you not capable of defending the things you say?
Need examples of his accomplishments ... that's easy!

Foreign policy was obummers biggest failures ... illegal immigrants, reclaiming territories lost ISIS under Obama,  North/South Korea declare peace after 68 years, China agrees to rework auto trade, etc
Alright, dumb fuck, let’s do this.
Amount #Russia Paid @NRA
Plus @realDonaldTrump accepted $108 million to fund his tiny inauguration crowd (twice as much as the biggest in history @BarackObama inauguration) then the MONEY VANISHED.
