Bravo, New Hampshire! Thank you!
a republican said he'd sign an anti discrimination bill?    a republican ?   That's surprising, very cool, but surprising considering most of the anti trans bills set into motion have been heavily back by republican party.
All 50 states to need to pass this law !! Way to go New Hampshire!!
This is way overdue.
This is what conservatives and evangelicals call politically correct and what the people whom it protects, human rights.
If it already exists than this bill is pointless
I 'identify' as a fxcking penguin, I want an ice filled pool and an UNlimited supply of fresh herring.
Someone needs to keep an eye on Ben Shapiro...
@MSNBC Wow

The fact that you’re gay has nothing to do with the fact that you’re just another intolerant and narrow minded person who wants to cause conflict and make useless noise. If you’re bothered by LGBTQ rights being extended, by all means don’t take advantage of them. You’re obsolete
I have plenty of rights. I just don't have to scream I'm gay and I want more rights because my feeling are hurt because they will not give me an extra bathroom lol. Sad very sad Just glad I'm not mouth breathing Liberal.
I doubt you need to scream that you’re gay. You see the type to be obvious. A mouth breathing liberal?  As opposed to a nose breathing liberal?  Is there a difference?  Regardless, sorry that you’re sad. And are scared of other people having extended rights. Away with you now.
Not sad lol. It's just stupid to have so called rights forced on people. States voted on gay marriage and the results were no. Well it made the Liberals mad so they had to sue and force it on the states so extended forced rights. "Away with you" lol you so funny, Always happy!
