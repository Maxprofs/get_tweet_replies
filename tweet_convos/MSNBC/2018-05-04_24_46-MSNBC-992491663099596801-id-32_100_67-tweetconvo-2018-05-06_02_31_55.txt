This, folks, is what Democrat privilege looks like.
If you're reading this and haven't seen @ChapquiddickMov yet, I suggest you do so.
Now that is privilege.
Were the Judges on the Connecticut Supreme Court appointed by Democrat friends of the Kennedy family?  Democrat judges don`t decide cases following the law, they decide cases based on the outcome they want.
WTF !!!!
Not again...........
I feel so bad for the girl's family they have been denied justice
Proving once again the Kennedys get away with murder.
Another Democrap cover up !
liberal judged need to be disbarred this case was proven and the man is guilty
Thank goodness that Martha can finally stop being a financial vehicle for so many people..  Let her rest in peace.
Oy
That Kennedy privilege! Literally getting away with murder, generation after generation.
Omg
And the Kennedy mystique lives on.
"You have the right not to be killed. Murder is a crime. Unless it was done by a policeman...or an aristocrat."
Good! Mr skakel has been wrongly convicted because of One Celebrity seeking investigator, Mark Fuhrman! Mark loves to plant or fabricate evidence!
Figures.

#wow
I've never believed that Michael Skakel killed Martha Moxley. They were friends. He had a crush on her. He had NO MOTIVE and was only targeted because he's related to the Kennedys. Martha's real killer has been FREE all these years.
Wow! That's big!
