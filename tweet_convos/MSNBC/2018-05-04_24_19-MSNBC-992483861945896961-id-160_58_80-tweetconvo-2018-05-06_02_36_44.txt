Yes, it's what all kids want, to go to school in a prison type environment...  Since there are absolutely no other solutions...  Duh!
No u idiot u need to stop taking $$$$$ from the nra and stop them selling guns to just anyone...certain schools??????? Harden them???????? What exactly do u mean?.......omg


@realDonaldTrump it doesn't call for harden schools. It calls for the removal of gun rights in the US you bum!
Trump says he wants more students to die so he can collect more money from NRA.
Yeah bc schools need to be treated like prisons...
Just a guess that he's not talking about "white suburban schools" that have spawned emotionally disturbed gunmen using assault rifles ... 
And this is why you will have the biggest teacher exodus in history this year.
How about....
WE. ARE. NOT. TARGETS!
He absolutely has no damn clue what he’s talking about and thinks he’s a god I and 80% of this country I love is so tired of his bull shit
But.... Don't we also have to "harden" outdoor music concerts, night clubs, churches, cafeterias, McDonalds, regional centers, post offices, community centers, navy yards and theaters? There have been mass shootings in all of these places too.
TRUMP is an embarrassment to every American
NO
God, I LOVE this President! SPEAK IT @realDonaldTrump
Would that be just the charter and private schools u endorse?
NBC SUCKS! NBC SUCKS!

NBC IS FAKE NEWS!

You Are Fake News

We The People Stand With Our Wonderful President Donald Trump 100%

It Still Feels GREAT To Be On The WINNING Side With President Trump

The Silent Majority Loves President Trump Now More Than Ever!!!

#KeepAmericaGreat
Yep - NRA loves it - more more more guns = more more more $$$$$

Parkland is a predominantly white middle class school . This out of touch fool needs to be kicked to the curb asap
He is such an embarrassment
Yes!
Guess he'll get to the Public schools when he's done with the Private ones.
So did they take the guns from the NRA members' cold dead hands as they entered the auditorium, or did they just willingly give them up and in turn submit themselves to being sitting ducks?
It’s Texas, they are all packing!  Would love to see some pissant try and shoot up that place.  They would last about 1 shot 
Everyone in Texas has a gun, therefore Texas is the safest place on Earth. Everyone says that. Can you recall where John F Kennedy was assassinated? I'm trying to remember.
I wasn’t born yet.  But Kennedy went against the wishes of the secret service and had an open car....if you recall.
Well that's a perfectly logical argument for unfettered access to guns then genius.
I wasn’t the one that had to go back to the early 60’s for an example 
Which schools? Who decides which children will go to a hardened school, and which children will be left vunerable?
"Harden certain schools"... WTF is that supposed to mean?
He's the STUPIDEST DUMBEST man EVER
VOTE TRUE BLUE better then being a RED DEAD HEAD. What does the color RED and the Russia have in common Comrade Tstupen.
why does this happen? read =- https://buff.ly/2FIlJ8A 
#PainefulTruth #trump #MAGA #stormydaniels #kanye #rightvsleft
Everything but no common sense #gunreformnow legislation.  Talk, talk, talk, it is all bullshit while more Americans die due to Congress’ inaction.  #VoteGOPout
Can he just shut up

Trumps speech on harden certain schools mention guns 4 teachers but doesn't say w/kind they need 2 face AR-15, Metal detectors & armed guards.Schools have R O,He never mentioned background cks, ban of all assault  guns, sm magazines or raising age. Speech was 4 2018 so go vote D


if we can't secure our schools then when this happens again the ones who are against keeping kids safe will get hit the hardest.There is no reason our kids life's should be in danger because adults don't want secure schools

IDIOT
He is a hard tool.
Just threw all the high school students under the bus
no mention of his stance on guns from back at the beginning of march, i'm guessing.
Parkland?
WTF?  Seriously.
IF you imagine children's heads where these targets are and you still WANT one ... YOU failed the psych screening for firearms.
Harden “certain” schools??
"Certain"? What the hell does that mean?

Arm the students!!!
@MSNBC Jackass
we are WAY TOO RACIST to arm teachers. The same dude who just stoked racist fears of Black and brown people wants to put guns in the hands of teachers whose students are Black and brown.
if we don't get rid of this man soon
millions of people are going to suffer for it

Fantastic. School fortresses.
Parkland Florida one of the safest areas of the country. So what are “certain schools”. What puts them in the hardening category?
Trump: CNN is fake news dont read or wat h anymore!
2 minutes later: let me read this great article they wrote about a judge in virginia
They don't become "certain schools" until it's too late.

Any organization that allows the sale of guns shaped to look exactly like cellphones, doesn't care about black people, doesn't care about the safety of Americans and DOES NOT value the lives or careers of Police Officers #NRAConvention #fakepatriots @DallasPD

Incredibly disappointed actually showed this it about selling more guns hardening school so that they have more guns about having more Mental Health care when he's the one who signed the bill that takes away Mental Health Coverage please you can do better than show this SICK diot

Once schools are armed camps will you move on to arming ushers at theatres next? Wait staff will be armed? Too many unregulated guns out there. How do you think bad guys with guns get theirs you moron @realDonaldTrump ?

all lies, he has no intention of ever 'hardening' any schools. ever.  Just talking crap for the NRA robotic puppies hustling firearms. Even they know he's lying to them. trump is incompetant. It's awful and everyone knows it but.. what ever.

Blame the victims, not the gun lobby or the NRA.
Check your congressperson for NRA rating of approval & vote accordingly.
Anybody else see it?
When he mentioned “mental health”, only one person clapped. What does that tell you? A bunch of lunatics are there? 
Omfg
@realDonaldTrump every time I listen to you speak I want to vomit. You're such a buffoon!!! BTW the NRA talking points you were given, don't help with your image.
There would be no way to know which school to "harden".  Honestly, we need practical suggestions.
No guns where he is today, to dangerous but wants guns in our schools, this #dotard has lost it..
No one knows what school will be attacked next are you serious? 
Remember when Trump promised to tackle the NRA and media outlets were full of praise?
He’s such a total DBag!!!
HE KNOWS NOTHING ! #trump
Especially if the school is in Debbie Wasserman Schultz's district.

She's owned by Pakistan and would love to see America disarmed.
Where do you even start with this prick and his lies?
His greatest hits! Still campaigning!
Build walls around the schools.
More guns is not the answer!!!  We need smart, sensible gun control!!  Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines & bump stocks!!!  Universal background checks are a must!!!!  Do this & we’ll be a safer society!
"Certain schools"... i bet these schools are packed full of white kids.  /s
Harden? Wtf does that even mean?
Turned it off the minute Air Force one was shown on TV. Watching reruns of Sex and the City.
Yes, quit giving this physo  air time.  It should be run as a political ad.  Charge him by the word.
@realDonaldTrump with every word you say, you divide this great country further and further. Pretty soon the pressure you are creating will give.
Pandering to NRA. Nothing else.
I do not wish death on anyone. I don't believe in threats to those I object to but Trump,  I may feel safe when you're gone. This chaos has got to stop.
Today Trump reverted to his strongman El Duce schtick. His term ended when his admirers hung him upside down in the capital.
The only thing he's hardened since 2006
What does "harden" schools even mean?
"hardening schools??" ...What a sutpid idea,... why not common sense gun laws? 
What's his plan on hardening all the Waffle Houses? Trump is such an idiot.
Preaching to his moronic base..... then trying to sell them a gun shaped like a cell phone.
Any organization that allows the sale of guns shaped to look exactly like cellphones, doesn't care about black people, doesn't care about the safety of Americans and DOES NOT value the lives or careers of Police Officers #NRAConvention #fakepatriots @DallasPD
The  is at it again!  If he wants to harden shcools, then why no guns at the #NRA #KKK meeting?
“Harden” bc he can’t get his little thing to harden. 

I think he’s like Dorthy & if he says “harden” 3x it’ll make his little member grow & harden. It won’t. #NRACONVENTION #TrumpNRA #NRAAM2018
which schools
Impeach this assh0le already. 

Enough is enough.
Ali couldn't resist the punch at Trump to start a segment off is an opinionated or is it facts MSNBC is nothing more than tabloid news
???????????
@POTUS is mentally ill @AMarch4OurLives
Parkland is a rich kids school. If it happened there, it can happen anywhere.
Strange how neighbor Canada doesn't have as many shootings.
Yea thats why they had a person run over a crowed of people and killed 8 gun control dosent stop mass murder
I hear you but bye,bye got to get on the plane!!!!
Fool
Trump is bad ass!!!
Because guns and mental health have nothing to do with it. :0
so grateful to live in california
How dare he even bring that up. He does not care and any word is meaningless
I have never hated a human being so much in my life.
Better to make our schools into prisons than require gun buyers to undergo any type of background checks! Unfettered access to guns “out trumps” the safety of our schools! At least that’s what the NRA told me when they gave their last hoooge campaign check!
Batsh!t crazy.
MSNBC giving free coverage to a psychopath! Congrats! See you've learned the lessons from #WHCD! #BoycottMSNBC
I agree. This is not news and I'm damn tired of it.
This is how he won the election in the first.
How about helping some dem candidates with all that airtime?
In the first place*
I bet not one, of those women or men in that audience has lost a child to gun violence.
your right because all these parents carry guns its only the people that dont carry get killed
He means more security at schools populated mostly by rich white kids
School aren't supposed to be like Army bases or bank vaults. How about we harden access to weapons of war....
No u want saftey u are going to get saftey plus weapons of war are already banned tht AR 15 u taklk sbout shoots the same rate as a shotgun
Speaking this rubbish at a “gun free zone”.  Hypocrite!
Mental health you, should look yourself mantal
Says the moron with armed security following his every move. We can’t even give our teachers supplies or a decent salary, but let’s give them loaded weapons that should help with the stress.
Do u know what let means???? If you are so stressed out then dont carry nobodys forcing anyone to carry

This is like some sh!t out of the 1930's. Mind-boggling.
Sickenning- relaity NRA helped to launder money for #trumpRUSSIA #treason . They promote hate and so did the Russian trolls promote hate and lies! #trason $uck$
Why give him this airtime he is awful

Azzhole!
Harden?????
No gun free zones.... This invites the maniac.
This comes from someone who was born with a silver spoon in hi mouth.
.@realDonaldTrump Most mass shooters kill themselves, knowledge that a gun is there against them is no deterrent! As you state. #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
Just shut up already!
What does this even mean? He's a lunatic
When you have to "harden" schools with armed guards in order to keep people safe, something is fundamentally wrong in society.
Shouldn’t have restrictions for guns at your NRA rally if you believe that schools need to toughen up
#RIPGOP #TrumpRussia
@CREWcrew was already filed a criminal complaint.
Yes!  The complicit anti American anti democratic @GOP is what's most troubling.
Let's harden background checks instead.

You spelled Obama wrong
So a prison?
