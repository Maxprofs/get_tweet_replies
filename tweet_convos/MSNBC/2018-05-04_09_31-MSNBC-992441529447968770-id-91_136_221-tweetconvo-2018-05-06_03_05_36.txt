NRA power based on the ability to deliver millions in gun manufacturers and Russian Rubles to candidates willing to sell out America......

*fewer

Please do not broadcast the hateful fear monger omg lies that come out of the NRA rallies. Trump will just spew more the same lies and catch phrases: witch hunt, border under siege, immigrants, Democrats, FBI. Why give this air time?
*fear mongering
Are you kidding? We've been gaining members exponentially since David Hogg has been pulling off those bullshit stunts.
I'm not sure you actually know what the word exponentially means…
Fewer, not less. Less liquid, fewer people. Americans are people last time I looked. I believe this is correct, more or fewer!
Depth Of Russian Politician's Cultivation Of NRA Ties Revealed
The #NRA is a terrorist organization. Plain and simple.   #VelshiRuhle
Russia funnels money through the NRA
@MSNBC , *fewer* Americans, please.
FEWER*!
PSA: Don't broadcast or advertise the speech. By doing so you're giving a platform to this nutty shit. Simply provide 'highlights' from it as 'needed'. Just make sure it's the 'dumber' parts of the speech...which shouldn't be hard.
Stop covering Trumps Rally's and outside speeches he doesn't deserve the air time it's the same old rhetoric over and over nothing new save your time and spare us.
If any #REPUBLICANS running for office would stay completely away from #Trump and the NRA and there money if they want any chance for winning come election time!
NRA will outlive the liberal media and all their supporters.
Stop covering him. It’s all lies.
Just where is all this "campaign" money coming from? Remington is filing for bankruptcy!! Gun sales are seriously down. They have backed almost all Repub candidates....so where is the money coming from???
NRA membership at an all time high= less American view the organization favorably
Majority of there money comes from people close to #Putin
He didn't explain why NRA Conference needed to be gun-free zone, while gun-free schools are considered an open invitation to murderers.
Did you poll MSNBC for these numbers?

@BobSMueller @NRA needs a good investigation to check their financial accounts keep following the crooked money  & get it for America for damages
we are millions strong and the poll you use is flawed they only do 20 percent republicans.There are many democrats who are gun owners and belong to the NRA.The lies from the media on this are unreal since we know we are the majority
Their membership sure keeps climbing and you say less Americans view them favorably?? REALLY????
"fewer" Americans. Not "less." @SRuhle cares about these things when POTUS makes mistakes, so I assume she will with these Tweets, too.
What if the nra didn’t exist?
If you are televising his remarks you will lose this viewer. Nothing he will spew today, particularly from that venue is something I care to inflict myself with. Enough.
Ba Bye ~ luckily FixerUpper is on HGTV. Annoying but a world better than Orangina and friends.
Never get the news or story right. Why don’t you just make up news. No sense reporting anything that’s true.
NRA lap dogs
When you need the cops or a gun to protect you, point your finger at the bad guy and and see how that works for you main stream twits....
Hey Steph have you figured out the difference between a revolver and a semi automatic yet?? HAHA that day was priceless girl. You and you graphics..

And it’s fewer-not less.
A recent poll shows FEWER Americans view the gun group..... Aren't you supposed to know basic grammar to be journalists?
Gee...I wonder what he'll say... "I won because of you."  "I am the best."  "Second Amendment is more important than Freedom of Speech!" "You are the true Patriots."  "Shoot first, then grab them by the pussy!"
Oh look! It's SHS's drinking buddy.
considering the amount of Russian money flowing in they should be investigated.
@TeamTrump Thank God we have Prez Trump protecting our Freedoms & Rights against those intent on taking them away, talking bout you "Fake News"
Fewer Americans.
msnbc has to quit polling only liberals    LOL
@NRA = Not Relevant Anymore
I'm not understanding why you're televising the event, this is disturbing.
LONDON IN SHOCK > MURDER & CRIME TSUMANI
LIBERAL ELITE LEADERS MUST BE VOTED OUT ASAP!
must see:
If that was true why have NRA memberships skyrocketed?  #2A
With @POTUS speaking at @NRAILA Convention, the question must be asked....

... Is the Russian-funded @NRA the secret back channel to Russia @realDonaldTrump & @WhiteHouse have been wanting???
Nazi lovefest. Hope God sends a meteor to hit the building and deliver us from this evil.
recent poll ? you mean poll of MSNBC sheeps
The NRA spent a record amount of money to elect Trump. Now, they're reportedly under FBI investigation for their financial ties to Russia. 

That's right: One of the country's most powerful lobbying organizations may have illegally funnelled Russian money to Trump's
The local school system will be running a tax levy for school safety in Aug.  I completely understand the need for this.  But, why is it the tax payers responsibility when the Gov't has zero accountability?  Maybe the NRA should fund these schools?!?!
More Americans view the NRA as favorable.
A new group needs to be started. Sensible gun owners against the NRA.

At the root of the problem is Citizens United, which allows millions of dollars to be pumped into campaigns.

We the people need access to the ears of our representatives.
Stephanie exposing all of these crooked corporate republican cronies who take all kinds of "dark corporate money" and a ton of money from the irresponsible greedy NRA!  #Enough  #NRAKills  #GOPCorruption
Ruhle is annoying
@realDonaldTrump and @GOP are owned by @NRA.
*fewer Americans
It's really not the wild wild west anymore...most of us have moved on!
A recent poll of your viewers.... how did your polls work on election night,, eh sweetie?
A resent poll shows majority of Americans do not view the news @msnbc @FoxNews @cnn as trustworthy...
Does the person who wrote this headline even English???
And in other news....
He's delivering remarks to the new Russia Alliance NRA

@MSNBC #GunReformNow
