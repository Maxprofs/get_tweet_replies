Well, I could have told you that. His entire mission was to reverse everything Obama did. He HATES the fact that our country was run by a black man.
No. just terrible policy's
Hmmm. Preventing mentally unstable people from being able to get guns is terrible policy? Clean air and water regulations are terrible policy? Consumer protection is terrible policy? That's just to name a few. Trump has reversed everything, without regard for US.
Obama hates America and did nothing but try to destroy her.  What did Obama actually do?.  He got the Noble Peace Prize for doing absolutely nothing.  @realDonaldTrump deserves the award but when people win it for doing nothing, it’s meaningless. Dems are the party of nothing
How about explain how the right is creating a socialist state?
Obama is the worst president in modern times, so it makes sense to oppose everything he did.
Obama wasnt the worst trump just ain't about nothing so you can keep your SMALL little man comments to yourself trump will never be the MAN Obama is and always be.
Weaponized the IRS, FBI

Fast and furious

Iran Deal

1.5 billion dollar paid day for terrorist

Freeing terrorist

Forcing American people to buy a product or else, than running up the price of the product and lowering the competition 

Put Criminals First.
Troll
So putting policies that the Obama administration went by on a tweet for people to see is being a troll cool I'll be a troll you be the sheep you are and we will both have a great day.
Because he is a R.A.C.I.S.T.
Because he's got absolutely nothing else in his locker. What did Obama do? Ok I'll do the opposite. That's his entirely policy making process
Trump still smarting over beating Obama gave him at WHCD.
The guy that paints himself ORANGE, HATES the man that was BORN with BRONZE skin. 

LoL
Giuliani is about as delusional as @realDonaldTrump. He thinks he can tell others what to do in our federal government like he owns everyone. That isn't how our Constitutional Republic works. PUT HIM IN PRISON!!
..."to appeal to his racist base.". There, fixed it
It all started with the birth certificate campaign that trump lost. Trump is & has always been a loser.
It all stems from the Washington correspondents dinner when Trump in the audience was mocked..
Jealousy of a former president doesnt look good on an already Orange Gorilla

#BarackObama will go down in history as being a real President, where #DonaldTrump will go down in history as being a real fake President.
And MSNBC is opposed to anything Trump does. In fact, they will make things up to report on just to oppose him. Tabloid gossip is your game, not news reporting.
He just can't get over how Obama made him look bad and the GOP. The man did it with class lets not ever forget THAT!
Loved by his wife.
That's because he's jealous of Obama. He knows most Americans loved and respected him. Trump needs to be the best but he can't compare to Obama so he's trying to erase him. Y else get rid of policies good for Americans?
Of course, he is, he hates Black people, the guy is a racist
Oppose Obama policy? Looks like a pretty good strategy.

Tell Donny that Blankenship said, “China persons,” not China people. You people have got to get it correct. Crooked Lying Don and his base attack you for things like that. China persons.
Well there is one thing that is very clear now; Trump is the Witch in Mueller's investigation.
Of course, he's a racist, ask his friend Roy Moore and Joe Arpaio, the kkk he supports!
No. These are actually the correct decisions that should have been made by the last administration.
Obama was a foreign policy nightmare for this country.
Obama did sooo much for us though....

Haha yeah. But, so are you
MSNBC is once again, garbage news!! Keep up!
An extension of GOP GIGOTRY AND RACISM.
We know on NK trump policy is working so.......
NARRATOR:  Duh
As are @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr who aid him in destroying this Country!
ICYMI: @ScottAdamsSays 

No, duh!
@Obama received country spiraling down out of control after Bush & turned things around
Now GREAT economy!
Why is trump against it?
@Obama received country spiraling down out of control & changed things to this GREAT economy
And to win a Nobel Prize. If this year’s Literature prize was cancelled due to sexual abuse allegations, the Nobel Prize will be shut down forever if Trump is in the running. #TrumpIsASexualPredator
Trump is just a flat out racist.
The left is opposed to everything Trump does
It's not just the idiot trump it's republicans across the board, that's the real reason they want to cancel the Iran deal.
Because Obama was the most screw-up president that we have ever had.
Fool. This applies to just about everyone in this “Administration”. If you could call it that. More like a revolving door at a penitentiary
Peace in Korea is now a bad thing ? fake news MSBC
Pretty sure this has to do more with @BarackObama race than anything else. 
#TrumpCrimeSyndicate
Exactly.
Obama's foreign policies was a disaster..
He appeased and did nothing .. golfing was more important to him.
Well that’s just one day in Trump’s world. Seeing that Obama didn’t do a damn thing besides divide this country.
Obama's name will be on his lips until the day he leaves this rock. Such blatant hatred.
All because Obama roasted Trump's ass hard at a Whitehouse Correspondents Dinner.
The funniest thing about this tweet is that MSNBC sends it out, pretending that @BenRhodes has some sort of believability!
Trump supporters retweet his tweets as though he has some sort of believability. Most of the Country knows he lies. His supporters don't care though and then talk about someone else's believability.
I think everybody knows this.  The funny thing is, I think a lot of Republicans will retweet Trump so that people like you respond, and then we can point out your hypocrisy for defending Obama's lies for the eight years he was in office.
You got that right. Trump suffers from “ Obama envy”!
Rhoads is under investigation by the job for his part in the spying of thousands of Americans and Trump and his family for 2 years before he ran for office.He is guilty on the unmasking with Rice who did this without warrants.The man is in trouble.
Wouldn't surprise me if 45 only lets NK release the 2 Americans that were taken hostage during his regime and lets the 1 American that was taken hostage during 44's administration stay in NK.
And yet NK came to table.  SK acknowledges Trump is the reason.  So quit.
Because everything was a failure. Its sad but true
Envy is the driving force to greed
Pretty good strategy if you ask me. Obama’s policies have proven completely ineffective. Why would he continue policies that have done nothing. We continually have people kidnapped and killed, missile tests terrorist uprisings. Also his tactics are actually effective.
We all are!
He can try all he wants but this administration has done nothing but ENHANCE the legacy of President Barack Obama @POTUS44 Hell, 45 might be lucky if he is on the GOP ticket in 2016.
Yeah, sending a terrorist state that hates our very existence billions of dollars to fund their terrorism is the smart thing to do!
Ben Rhodes? 

If Obama had a cure for cancer, Trump would find a way to undo it.  It's all about revenge.  Trump is still pissed that Obama made fun of him at that dinner.  Trump could care less about our country.   It's all about him.
Because what Trump is doing, is working.
I should hope so.
Yea and half the country was opposed to everything Obama did!!
It appears most republicans are opposed as well.
Hmmm maybe it’s his wife that’s driving this resentment?

@MSNBC Agreed
Buy N. Korea by giving them the farm. Everything that former presidents have worked to build thrown in the toilet of Trump’s ego & flushed.
Seems like a good idea. Obama did nothing with noko and they did nothing preventing Iran from nuclear weapons. Trump Is on verge of peace in Korea and has eu on board with tougher deal for Iran. So yes, obama did nothing.
Trump needs to own the president responsibility, and stop blaming others no longer in power and authority...
Rightfully so...@BarackObama did more harm to our country then any other President even Jimmy Carter
For the record, it isn’t just trump hating Obama, it’s all the old white racist members of congress who, supported by white evangelicals, are working to undo everything Obama did regardless of who it hurts. The ACA could have been tweaked but repubs all ran on killing it.

Want to know what Trump and Rudy are afraid of?  Why are they getting out front of the Stormy Daniels payment now?    How about other NDA agreements.  According to Steve Bannon in Fire and Fury - "a hundred" women
…
You mean like how liberal media is opposed to anything Trump does...peace talks in North Korea, defeating ISIS, renegotiating trade deals, low unemployment
I thought i was the only one to believe that!
and thats why he is the best, Obama worked with terrorists to get his Iran deal done, gave hem millions of our dollars, Trump has done what he couldn't do or any other President bring an end to the Korean war and get NK to the table
Obama mocked him because he is a dotard. Now he is acting like a dotard.
@nytimes @CNN @FoxNews well President Trump has done ride and Obama did everything wrong and was a failure everyone knows he’s a failure always has been a failure
@nytimes @CNN that’s a lie President Trump is only against things that hurt US citizens
This is not news... it’s not even new!
Amen! @POTUS is jealous of Obama! Second, he still cannot believe a black man actually led for 8 years because he feel privileged and entitled for everything in this country. Third, he is jealous of Obama’s brain, charisma, youth, looks.... So the best weapon, oppose him!
Has nothing to do with race. Obama was digging us into a huge hole. Another 8 years of Obama would have had America a 3rd world country. Trump has and is doing a great job of bringing America back to a leading Country again. The race card is over folks time to look at facts.
Unfortunately, so is half of America! They see only the black half in him!
No shit!
@brhodes can’t defend his/Obama’s policies on their merits so he resorts to this childish line.
This too will change! #Winning #Trump2020
like a mad dog
Because nothing he did worked
I think that is a mis-characterization. DJT BHO have very different policy views. Without judging BHO, under DJT unemployment is now below 4%, market has hit historic highs, N Korea is sitting down to talk and this country’s horrible trade deficits are reversing. These are facts
Seems to be workin!   so why stop now?
Trump is so jealous of Obama. He seems obsessed with him. But then again Trump is not smarter than a fifth grader and Obama taught Constitutional Law and is very smart.
As a staunch (almost religious) defender of the #IranNuclearDeal, I’m not sure how we’re supposed to trust anything @brhodes says... EVER!
The Iran deal is in our best interest. Ben Rhodes is right.
You’re absolutely right.  Ensuring Iran has the capacity to create a nuclear weapon... and giving them the cash to pay for it, is definitely in our best interest 
You need a heavy dose of reality, bud. Sad.
Who really cares what Ben Rhodes or any Obama’s staff thinks??? They are the SWAMP, lied, cheated, and made our country vulnerable.
Cause anything Obama did was a disaster.
Brilliant political strategy just like his legal one...well suited to someone with oppositional defiant disorder...
Just think if BHO had done anything right for the people @realDonaldTrump  would not have to be opposed to what sneaky snake did
That's not true. So you're saying enacting clean air and water regulations were bad for the ppl? It was not. It was only bad for corporations that polute the air to make money Obama wanted them to do it responsibly. Trump said f the ppl and air, make your $ easier. No regulations
BHO never hand the experience or the knowledge to make anything that he signed while in WH to work. He talked a lot & accomplised  little while @POTUS  tweets alot and get a lot done . Study and compare
Yes he did & just because you say he didn't doesn't make it true. If Obama had any problems making things work it was DIRECTLY related to the obstructionist GOP who wanted to assure his failure. He was able to do alot while in office bc if he didnt, how cld trump undo what he did
Did you see the sour pouse on DarMika's face when she heard the great jobs number. Sad.
So then, he is opposed to doing nothing. #MAGA
pure racism. Trump cannot BUY the integrity and morals that OBAMA has. And will NEVER be the President Obama was
Straight from Donnie  Duechbag's mouth great unemployment number what's going on with North Korea, and Iran the President could get reelect in 2020.
And you all are opposed to ANYTHING @realDonaldTrump  does! It's no wonder your not trusted!
Yeah....because Barry Sotoros is an anti-American crackhead idiot. Simple stuff really
Correct, doing the opposite brings results. Same thing with the economy.
L and #MSNBC is opposed to anything Trump does! What’s ur point?
Mika who is a loose cannon normally is out of control when Joe is not there to keep her in her cage. Her hatred for Trump and anything Trump is clear to the audience and yes he did insult you but be the grownup for God sake you ruin the show for many.
as for Rudy he has compromised integrity truth for a brief moment in power and spotlight. Very alarming.
Seems to be working. What's that say about Obama's policies?
MSNBC = Putin's Puppets
the MSM is opposed to anything Trump does.... NK, taxes, economy, security...... 
HES BRINGING PEACE!! Get it!? Did OBAMA?   No he just bowed!!!
@hardball when I see Trump my sub conscience take over and I see lies cheater fraud fake bully showboat perv foolish there's more but
Probably, because they were disasters
I'm glad you said probably because they were not disasters at all
Many
No they weren't.
That’s because President Obama was highly respected—Mr Trump is not!!!!
Because Obama and his administration were inept and incompetent
@hardball Trump can only see black when it comes to BO. Then his sub conscience take over.
Obama who
TRUMP IS WITHOUT ANY CONSCIENCE T/F MORAL AUTHORITY
You people watch FOX news but you're not reporting anything about the Hillary Clinton's corruption/collusion with Russia during the election & none of the Comey lies an crimes he committed. Your a pathetic one sided bias news media that doesn't tell the public all the truth.
So very true!
Bot
The vast majority of American citizens are also opposed to the social incompetence and lawlessness created and promoted by the previous democrat anti American administration.
That's a lie. The kind of lie trump tells daily. Not the vast majority of American citizens,  just the 30 something percent of Americans who are Trump's base.
No kidding! Opposed to a nuclear Korean Peninsula and opposed to the number 1 sponsor of terrorism having approval and a path to nuclear weapons. Who wouldn’t be?
Works 2 ways Mr Trump as President Obama is opposed 2 all your actions such as 150 days @ Margo Largo since in office, talking about what u r going 2 do & do nothing, except GOLF, TV & Internet, having Moscow hookers perform a Golden Shower routine & of course cheating on Melania
Trump's priorities: reverse anything the black man did
Daaah!  But only because almost all of what Obama did was bad for the economy and foreign policy and the American people.  God bless Trump.
Do people really get their news from this clown show?
That’s a pretty short list
There’s a reason for that. Trump is openly racist, his base is openly racist, his political party is openly racist, and they love it when he opposes everything the black president did.
He catches on fast
and that's a good thing
Because Obama was a failure...
Translation: "Trump is opposed to Failed policies" .
So are we common sense thinking folks! Liberalism is a mental disorder.
Obama was admittedly mentored by COMMUNISTS.  Of COURSE Trump opposes everything he did.  MOST of us did.
Noooo Ben, Trump is just opposed to criminals. Obama spied on a Presidential candidate, blamed it on a foreign country, sanctioned them and kicked out their diplomats. Obama needs to go to prison.
Keep crying.
And the left is just opposed to anything that Trump tries to do.
The little that Obama did do we are all opposed.
...or didn’t do.
Or Barrack @BarackObama , community organizer and middling student, was incompetent.  One of those, maybe.
Comes down to WHITE and BLACK
Not so He is apposed to  anything that is not good for America The difference is logic Obama had little logic for foreign diplomacy teeth Trump on the other hand knows exactly how to deal with other countries
He looks like a DAMN FOOL
Ugh yeaaa. Obama made a mess of everything now it needs to be cleaned up.
Because everything that Obama did was bad for the country and the world!
Well duh. We knew this.
