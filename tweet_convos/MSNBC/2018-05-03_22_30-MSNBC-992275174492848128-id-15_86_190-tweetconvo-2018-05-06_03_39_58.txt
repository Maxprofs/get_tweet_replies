One thing to be stubborn Missouri, but another thing to be stupid in believing this Governor who makes fools of all with his disregard for people, women in general, by deceit and ego. Do what you do but America is watching. Women are watching.

And it took this long, why?
Not sexual misconduct. Rape.
Funny how the GOP only acts when they are shamed and forced into doing the right thing.
Does Trump Get the Same Treatment For Sexual Misconduct, Embarrassing His WiFe & Pissin On Prostitutes in Russia? Oh NeverMind Since It’s Trump “Same Rules Don’t Apply!” My Bad! This “Double Standard” ShiT Make Me Confused Sometimes!!
Finally
