@timkaine , @MarkWarner
Leftists r never satisfied; we get a shit, lying, non-repeal bill & u idiots still have to oppose it bc the GOP presented it. FREE MARKET.
The problem is the pre-existing coverage is still in place, undermining the entire premise of insurance-this is why premiums will still rise
Really wish many of us heard from AMA a little louder and much more earlier.
Bi-partisanship with this group won't happen in a million fucking years!
@SethDavisHoops Not a single Republican voted for ObamaCare.  Where was your 'Bi-Partisanship'?
"ACA was debated in three House committees and two Senate committees, and subject to hours of bipartisan debate"
ZERO Republican votes.  See if the 'Snopes' definition of Bi-Partisanship has ZERO in it
but you still took money from the healthcare industries.Democrats took stocks out on these industries and made millions.This is not right
Where's my $2500 savings?
Left wing hack,no wonder most doctors arent members
Or repeal entirely and start all over to get it right.
Democrats should now realize the industry participants are completely toothless & neutered  next time they have ability to shape healthcare
Time to put congress under ObamaCare.
@SenateGOP these #healthcare professionals will help you improve the #aca @ANANursingWorld will also come to the table #dotherightthing
Why can't I bring it up to read it?!?!?? Secret???
The midnight, backwood skinny repel of Obamacare didn't work!! Awesome work by our legislators!!
Please, @SenRonJohnson  &  @SenJohnMcCain , I hope you''ll  consider @AMA 's harsh assessment of the #skinnyrepeal before you cast yr vote!
American Med Assoc says NO on Skinny Bill  @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenDeanHeller @SenJohnMcCain @SenCapito Please vote no. 
If only you all wouldn't have been so resistant to #SinglePayer in the past, we wouldn't need to be here now.
THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING UP!! 
Please disrupt this process. U r all wealthy & won't b hurt. Millions of people will. Ryan cannot b trusted; his dream is 2 blow up Medicaid
Reckless and indefensible to play rushin' roulette with healthcare for millions of American families
Thank you for your continued advocacy. #SkinnyRepeal
And Obamacare is better?  Idiots.
I do have a crush on my doc

Obamacare was a toxic prescription but you supported it anyway.

Has the @AmerMedicalAssn owned the opioid epidemic yet?
Thank you @AmerMedicalAssn for standing for the American people today! #ACASaved
We hope-silently waiting for an answer. Hoping that tomorrow she still has the coverage she needs to stay alive.
@SenateMajLdr  @POTUS Ya know every Medical group in USA is against this shit/ Do you think they know nothing about the problems?
@SenateGOP Can y'all read???

Find your humanity.
For the sake of your family.
For the sake of your constituents.
For the sake of your country.
@BillCassidy Remember them?! Remember us?!
@marcorubio I hope you read this and we hope that you will not vote for this skinny bill.
Absolutely
So says a beneficiary of the failed #ACA
PLS @SenJohnMcCain @LindsayGrahamSC and @SenateGOP don't toss 16 mil off #healthcare in middle of night w/ #Skinnybill Work w/ @SenateDems
.@SenCoryGardner LISTEN 
@SenCapito - this isn't just a constituent pleading you do the right thing, but the AMA. WV needs you to lead. Vote no!!!
PLS @SenCapito @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenDeanHeller don't toss millions off #healthcare in middle of night. Fear.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP wake the hell up!
.@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake pay attention to some experts
@SenJohnMcCain @SenDeanHeller @SenCapito 
There are none. Even the "healthcare isn't a right" physicians still want the populace to have insurance so they get paid. #positiveright
AS a physician  I concur.
I call BS
Why ask nicely?refuse to treat Republican  politicians,how about that?
Can these imbeciles listen to all of the professional medical organizations whom this policy will do tremendous damage to the patients. SMDH
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC  #VoteNo
@marcorubio
Stick to medicine, AMA; leave the politics to others, m'kay?
"Skinny" the way leprosy is a weight-loss plan.
What does @SecPriceMD think of this, I wonder.
Does @SenateGOP just ignore this letter?!
@SenateGOP LISTEN 2 the AMA! #KillTheBill #November2018
How was McCain even medically stable to vote? His judgement at this juncture is suspect at best. Without that one vote...
Sadly, there is no such thing as a bipartisan effort anymore.
