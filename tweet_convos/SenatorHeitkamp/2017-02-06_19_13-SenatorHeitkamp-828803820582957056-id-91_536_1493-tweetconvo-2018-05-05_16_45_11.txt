@BernieTheBest1 @SenatorHeitkamp @GOP  if Corps N elites paid their taxes public schools would be fully funded. Fix real problem
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Heitkamp. Thank you for trying.
@SenateDems go voichers
Thank you for fighting for our kids.
True! If Repugnicans can allow this clueless moron to become Secretary, they have no morality or scruples!
yes we need a person who know how to improve education
Thank you for standing up against DEVOS #NoOnDEVOS @SenatorHeitkamp @SenateDems
@SenateDems hopefully u will lose ur job soon
No Betsy.
, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watch "Waters World"  Millennials can't answer basis history or current event questions.  Need new perspective on education
Thank you, Sen. Heitkamp! Keep #potentialgrizzlies out of our schools! And wack jobs like #DeVos too!
Education has taken a backseat to social/political agendas. Our kids are unprepared & undereducated upon graduation.
Companies are having a diffulicut time transitioning new grads into workforce & dealing w/crybabies,safeplaces  #votedevos
@SenateDems There is certainly someone better out there. Even if  procharter, impossible for them to be less competent.
Thank you for standing up for the kids! They are the future! #HoldTheFloor #StopDeVos
You are what you you portend repubs to be
Schools have become places of Liberal indoctrination. These ppl Want to control the minds & thoughts of our kids
Current system is broke.  I worked with it for 11 years. Where is your solution?  None!  Vote for Devos!
@SenateDems Thank you!
@KeepsinItRealz "For the children!" The battle cry of manipulating, pandering libs. They only care about votes & union $$$.
THANK YOU, HEIDI!!  We appreciate that you heard us here in NoDak and are standing up for what is right for education.
@SenJohnHoeven
@SenateDems thank you for standing up for our kids
Dedicated teachers & tax $ still failing the kids.When you don't have a new perspective go with the person that does.DeVos.
@SenateDems Excellent words!
@SenateDems  It won't matter who is nominated. You're just pissed off that HRC won. Get over your self-importance!
thank you!!
@damonbethea1 Thank you so much, Senator. I wish our senators from Arkansas had the backbone to oppose DeVos' nomination.
@SenateDems thank you for voting No on Betsy DeVos.  Unqualified!
I've been disappointed with some of your votes for guys like tillerson, so I'm thankful you're saying #NoonDeVos
Thank you @SenatorHeitkamp #NotoDeVos
Please point to the ways @SenateDems have improved public schools along with some improvement statistics.

thank you for your hard work and dedication to students and teachers in North Dakota
Thank you for voting against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos! All American kids deserve better! #HoldTheFloor #StopDeVos
Do you support school choice to offer inner city kids in this country a chance for a better education?
@SenateDems in a few more hours we'll have Secretary DeVos. The more you hate her the more we like her
We can do so much better than you. You should be recalled for helping to appoint Rex Tillerson. cc:@SenateDems
thank you for taking a stand and being our voice. #StopDeVos
@eddyrogerparker why isn't the WH listening? Why have they shut down? The public is trying to get through! #noDevos
@SenateDems you are dead wrong and will be proven for what you are.
Thank you to all of you for fighting for our kids education!
@SenateDems  Thank you for standing against DeVos confirmation.

@SenateDems Do you mean the democrats? Lol
" @SenatorHeitkamp #StopDeVos Amen For Your Words On The Floor!!! "

@SenateDems Democrats are in bed with the Teachers Union and always have been. Vouchers gets kids out of failed schools!
@SenateDems no you can't. The people have voted. Stop obstructing!
@SenateDems a teacher who has taught n the Educational system for a number of years would b better then Ms Money Bag #GOP
@SenateDems Thank you senator!
@SenateDems the last 8 years not so good... get out of the way and allow progress
Thanks, Senator Heitkamp. As the child of 2 public school teachers, I applaud your efforts. Go get 'em!
@SenateDems it wouldn't matter who @POTUS selected, you'd be doing the same thing! Start helping the country vs your party
THANK YOU Senator!!!!
@SenateDems unions got to them didnt they.
What do you care? No senators send their kids to public schools. Maybe doing so should become requirement.
@SenateDems pointless whining
.@SenatorHeitkamp Sure we can "do" better. But how much did those so-called "qualified" people give to Republican politicians?
@SenateDems THANK YOU! #NoOnDevos

@SenateDems Thank you Senator Heitkamp!!
@SenateDems ...it's a real headscratcher, like Dr.Ben Carson leading HUD!!
Bought and paid for by the National Teachers Organization. We know where you are coming from!
Tell Hoeven to do the same!  #NotoDeVos
