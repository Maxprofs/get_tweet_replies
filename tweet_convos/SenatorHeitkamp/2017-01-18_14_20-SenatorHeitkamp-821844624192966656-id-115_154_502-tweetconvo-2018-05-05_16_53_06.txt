420,000 men lost in WW2 fighting fascism and you want to stand with Flynn, Bannon and Trump. You spit on their graves!
my WWII grandad...He was a Trump supporter and proud American Patriot. Quit spitting on his 33 yrs of service.

You will stand with Nazi's but not your constituents! You need to be voted out!

well tell that to trump and all his cabinet picks that want to destroy the very things they are appointed to uphold
@LunaBrandes The Dems need to pay attention to this, if they don't expel the babies, they have no hope of coming back.
please fight for EVERYONE'S rights
Thank you Senator for not following the others. I appreciate your choice very much. Enjoy yourself and be safe.
was there ever a question on attending Senator?
An honorable Senator! Character Trump's Criticim
HELL NO! Listen to the people lady, we don't want any transition! We want him OUT!!!
# not under a man who was groomed by Roy Cohn  (Google him)
Yeah....It's always an act of courage to support one's nation. #DontStrainYourself
sadly this was anything but peaceful.
whatever!!!
thank you for honoring democracy and the peaceful transition of power 
John Brennan... couldn't do much worse... is he the leaker? Etc. Etc. And I only went back FOUR DAYS. #cometogether ????
Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing...his district, which is...falling apart #cometogether
Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night... #cometogether
Thank you for respecting the office.
Class! Thank you!
Thank you for this.
. @SenatorHeitkamp very refreshing ! TY  it will take ALL OF US TO #MAGA  and that should be everyone's interest
Thank you.
A peaceful transition of power-- to a lying infantile narcissist who owes his victory to Russia. Does this not trouble you?
The peaceful transfer of power is one of the most sustaining actions of our Government. Thank you for participating in that
well duh you think...not doing anything special just patriotic duty more than rest of your disgusting party
Great attitude. True leadership!
Thank you!
TY, .@SenatorHeitkamp, for showing decency & respect for #America.
Thank you for doing the right thing. Btw, I hope the chuckleheads in your party don't come after you. Be safe 
Thank you, Senator, for your courage, patriotism and understanding of the democratic process & peaceful transfer of power.
@BobbyAxelrod2 God Bless you. wish the rest were as mature as you at this point.
thanks for standing up for liberty.
THANK YOU for being respectful an Adult!!!!! 
tolerant hyenas
sorry for the hateful comments. I've learned liberals are all for free speech til U say something they don't want to hear.
Bravo. An adult and someone that understands what it's about.
Thank you for honoring the Americans who voted and for working to solve issues to make America succeed!
hmmm ... Legacy Of Loss...LOL
thank you Senator. I appreciate the tweet I wish President  Obama's had of tried to tame the lions in his News Conf. today
I can name 60 who won't win reelection. ..adding to Obama legacy of loss
Respect.
That is your choice. But you are normalizing an illegitimate candidate. Our senators should have more integrity than that.
and we are all sure you will ride in on Trumps coat-tails. #sycophant
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you. It’s the responsible and intelligent thing to do. I respect you for going.
Your duty is to reject the fascist, kleptocrat, unqualified, unfit, treasonous, Putin puppet.
Thank you for "adulting" and paying proper dignity and respect to the democratic process we are privileged to partake in!
Thank you for being your own person, not a follower, surely a patriot and one that sets good examples & will work 4 ppl.
@TheChrisSuprun thanks for normalizing all the horrible things hes said and done
Thank you to someone who puts her country first!
Thank you for your leadership and service.
@TheChrisSuprun Not an acceptable response at this juncure.
 proud of you Senator.
Thank you
That is not why you're doing it. Nice try though.
@TheChrisSuprun How is not attending an event not peaceful?
thank you for having some sense
Please make sure you relay that concept to the President
I wish U had taken a stance.At least you could come 2 Fargo 21st for human and and women's rights?Stand w/Ur constituents,
more should follow your example. Nobody boycotted Obama even though they were very unhappy.
way to go. As an elected official it is your job I think. It is for the people
you voted against expanding background checks. nobody in your party cares what you think, fyi.
very very very impressive. Strong and brave
Many ways to acknowledge peaceful transfer of power. Attending a ceremony to empower a treasonous loon isn't one of them.
Thank you, AMERICA appreciates your Patriotism.
@TheChrisSuprun its a good thing I don't live in N.Dakota then, cause I would never vote for you again
@TheChrisSuprun That is disappointing.
Thank you
Come together when reasonable...but for God's sake, protect us from the capitalist feeding frenzy. "The economy" isn't ppl.
it is very clear that Trump and Team have no goals of working for all americans. Going supports this effort. #HaveDignity
You really need to change your tv channel! Your comment is proof you're part of the problem 
and I will have no respect for you.
Thank you, Senator. Hope you will work well with the Republican president, senate and house members.
finally, a grown up in the room.
@TheChrisSuprun Our duty is to come tgthr for bigotry, misogyny, bullying, disrespect, defamation and no grasp of reality?
you a real numbnut have no clue what @realDonaldTrump stands for
Thanks for being so stand up and brave! I'm sure being a political hack for President Pee-Pee is tough!   @TheChrisSuprun
are you going to vote to impeach him for his political crimes ?
Thank You! You've shown we are All Americans
Have fun ! I will be protesting him on the 20th and marching 4 women's rights on 21st. Not my President. @realDonaldTrump
Duty to come together? No. Trump is not a normal human being, and by attending you are normalizing him #nevermypresident
You more than almost any other politician put country before party. Hope you win in 2018!
@TheChrisSuprun okay well enjoy. I will be protesting this insanity at the #WomensMarch
Awww, another poor snowflake upset with Republican nation. The adults are back in charge.
When the toilets get redacted, we have a huge problem in DC....http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/don-johns-porta-potties-hiding-trump-inauguration-article-1.2945767 …
thanks for your courage.
"Peaceful", where have you been?
The ones who need to come together are @realDonaldTrump and those in Washington. If they can't agree how can we? #havefun
Thank you for acting like an adult and a leader.
You are the only grown up pro American democrat so far.
see problem is we are very pro america trump is pro putin and fascist state
Thank you for respecting the peaceful transition!
USA
Mahalo!
Be careful @SenatorHeitkamp, the loons in your party will show up with pitchforks and torches to your house! Congrats for rising above!
Thank you.
.@SenatorHeitkamp Thanks for being a grownup.
no thanks needed here it is what is RIGHT
Amen.... we don't always agree, but we are all Americans. #ComeTogether
Classy.
not classy but the patriotic and right thing to do...
Pls do everything in your power to hold Trump accountable. There are too many areas in which he needs that to mention here.
Thank you for being respectful to our new President!
thank you
Thank you, Senator. :)
Thank you!!!
USA! USA!
