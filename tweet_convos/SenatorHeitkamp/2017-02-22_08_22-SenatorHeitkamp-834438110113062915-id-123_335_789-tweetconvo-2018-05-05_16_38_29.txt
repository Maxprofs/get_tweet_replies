It's the only way the US and the rest of the world can save themselves from Pres. Bannon's chilling ideology.
Agreed!
Thank you!
Where were you on Hillary's e-mails/server? Nice partisanship ... Nice fence riding.
Does this obsolve you from voting for @realDonaldTrump cabinet members?
@SenateDems can we investigate your cabinet votes while we're in there?
Do your jobs .. stand up to the bully and  castrate him make a difference
WEREN"T YOU FOR #DAPL   #resist #theresistance #maga #indivisible

Thank you @SenatorHeitkamp!
@SenateDems independent investigation is what we need NOW!
@mch7576  How about Israeli influence on Dem party?
@SenateDems good luck!
@KathyStricker2 we need to stop calling Russian interference and manipulation of the 2016 election "Attempts"!
@SenateDems They should first investigate Obama meddling in Israel's elections. Can be one sided.
Thank you! Now please demand Sessions recuse himself, so investigation can be as objective and impartial as possible.
With all due respect, You are going to INVESTIGATE TILLERSON - YEA vote by you .  CORRECT YES or NO. #Kompromat
oh and Isreal doesn't bet your bought and paid for by AIPAC eh...
.@SenatorHeitkamp @COsChildren just FYI not every liberal wants to primary you out of office. Thx for your service!
Why on earth did you vote to confirm Ross then? I don't understand.
lol, really, you're serious? That is so stupid, vote DEms out
@SenateDems 
I hope this comes through better than your vote on Pruitt. #EPA
@mch7576 @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris So Senators, how can you force McConnell to move on this?
You are a Republican wolf in Democratic sheep's clothing. You are nothing but a cheerleader for 45's cabinet picks. SHAME!!
And PLEASE subpoena @realDonaldTrump @POTUS TAX returns.  #TaxReturns
please do not let this get buried the way the news is reporting it to be.
a good step. Still want #independentcommission
We do not trust u to make good decisions. U have proved that
Senator we continue to look for a Democate who caresmore for the people than her personal interests
No big.  Russia influenced our govt. on Oct. 1962 also.
while you are at it,investigate the Latino connection
@SenateDems Russia has hacked the democrats brains.
Any news on the investigation of the anti Trump insiders that gave classified info to the media?
agree. now get bipartisan on the other issues too!
@SenateDems Should not be a political issue, it's a national security issue #UnfitToLead #MakeAmericaSmartAgain
it's not a question we can leave with any doubt. Trump can't be allowed to flip flop on accountability.
Please be strong and keep on the pressure, @SenatorHeitkamp. We deserve answers!
@no2l what took so long?
@pldanzis We need a Special Prosecutor. @jeffsessions has ties to Trump & @FBI compromised by Comey.#TheResistance
@SenToomey @SenBobCasey Mr. Toomey, PA is watching YOU!  Russia MUST be investigated. Sec Svc costs must be curtailed!
Americans want an independent bipartisan committee to investigate #RussianCollusion
.@SenatorHeitkamp You could start with the Sec. of State you voted to approve...
WE NEED A "SELECT INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN" COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE!
and a light suddenly appears...
Thank you!   We just want THE TRUTH.
This is ridiculous Sibel Edmonds blew the whistle and nothing...include Hastert. #ExposeJan
thanks you!
Investigate John Mcain, Hillary and Podesta.
Come on the FBI knows Jan was blackmailed.  @sibeledmonds #ExposeJan
We need an independent investigation. Not a subcommittee where GOP has majority.
Investigate Jan Schakowsky!    # ExposeJan.
No Heidi release the 650,000 emails no more smoke screens.
@SenateDems  With respect Senator, must be 9/11 type investigation for all to feel fair. Thank you.
@SenateDems  Sessions must recuse himself from investigation. Thank you for your work.
I wonder what will happen if Intel discovers @wikileaks documents actually came from a Democrat insider.
please push for an independent investigation!
@SenateDems Thank you, Heidi!
@SenateDems oh did you decide to be a Dem today ?
anything short of a completely independent, open review will just be another coverup.  Do this right!!
You're new to politics, aren't you? This is the real problem. It a "bromance"! @MELANIATRUMP  is out! Putin's in
But NOT a select committee, which Sen. McCaskill and other Democratic senators have called for?
@SenateGOP I support this 100% and Sessions MUST recuse himself. GOP wanted a special investigator for Hillary
perhaps there is some embezzlement?  Are tax dollars lining some pockets?
...Or perhaps investigate how much Obama made while in office? His teen girls have over 250m each? ...
you are another 1 term loon
perhaps you could investigate how much the Clintons and other Dems made on the Russian uranium deal?
We need a senate select committee to ensure an honest, open and complete investigation.
@SenateDems Thank you!
#ExposeJan
good its about time
will it be just another rubber stamp for GOP?
@SenateDems @SenateGOP should be pushing for this! Stalling to push through items will haunt later as voters remember well
@anti_orange1 Oh, look, Heidi, you did something "vaguely" Democratic. You feeling ok?
DEMAND... don't urge!
Don't stop pushing for the truth.  Thank you!
You're clumsy strategy of Russia Russia is a hoax. Nobody believes it except the violent protesters you incite @SenateDems
Russia Russia? Is that like Pizza Pizza?
We need "TRUTH IN OUR GOVERNMENT"
cult members b Irish  Molly. Can't save criminals from prison time for uneducated unlicensed practices. @potus
Then that committee needs to be staffed with non-politicians.  I believe little to none  of any prior committees invest
@SenateDems and why these mysterious deaths?  The dead can't tell
@SenateDems Thanks. Please work on your Republican colleagues
@SenateDems DT in bed w/Putin &  is meddling in our Gov. but its business as usual?GOP wants 2 bury.
Senator what we need is an independent investigation not a republican led committee
Yes! Never trust 1 political party to investigate its own party.
@SenateDems URGE? Why not demand. This may be the most serious issue and people are "deciding" if it is a problem?
RETIRE NOW
@SenateDems Too little too late Heidi.  You are a traitor to the planet.  #resist
Thank you! We support your integrity! Good luck. This adm. is extremely dangerous & there is much more to uncover there. $$
What about Obamas connection to Creamer #ExposeJan #ExposeCreamer
@SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenSanders I hope Senator Schumer is on that committee...0h & NOT Sen Blunt
@SenateDems YES PLEASE.
@SenateDems we will not believe the results of the Repugs investigation. Independent Investigation Only
@SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth THIS IS WHAT WE DEMAND. #ANGRYAMERICANS #REVOLT
@Flaka_Teodoro ANTYHING less than 9/11 type independent investigation is smoke & mirrors. GOPutin has LOTS to hide, & will.
#ExposeJan @sibeledmonds
What deal was cut after FBI brief on Fri that GOP senators yelling last week are now anti investigation?@SenateGOP
Whoa, what? I thought they were more in favor after that?
No, independent committee, we no longer trust you or anyone else in Senate.
PLEASE DO YOUR JOB and do not let up on this investigation.  We are WATCHING YOU.
and oh like you have any proof of your accusations? put up or shut up.
Will this investigation cover the contact that Gen. Flynn had with Russian Diplomats prior to Pres. Trump's Inauguration?
of course I don't know, but I anticipate, once the sticks start being tugged, it will be like a game of KerPlunk.
The people demand that Trump administration is investigated as to their involvement with Russia & we want Trump removed
While you're at it, INVESTIGATE MEXICO'S BLATANT IN OUR FACES INTERFERENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 24/7/365.  Disgusting!
