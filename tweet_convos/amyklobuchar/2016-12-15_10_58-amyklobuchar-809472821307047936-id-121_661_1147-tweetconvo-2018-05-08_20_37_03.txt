Hillary did not loose because of Russia, get over it
Then why does an investigation frighten you?
did the Russians write the E-mails?
Did you fall on your head as a child? Try to stick to the topic.
yea, don't be mad a me because your Hillary sucked.
I'm not mad at you. You disgust me, but that's not the same thing. Now scoot.
#liberaltolerance
No, we need to see some hard evidence first and foremost. You don't launch investigations to support a desired conclusion.
IF USA allows Trump & his buddy Putin to keep harassing China   well, China has vowed to retaliate WW3 anyone?
there's no evidence of a Russian Hack.. but lots of evidence of democrat deceit.. thank you WikiLeaks
Show us on the doll where WikiLeaks "evidence" hurt your vote, democracy, or anything else?
@ljohn44 @StarTribune and a delay in the Electoral College vote!
Russia is way down the list of things that need to be investigated within the American political system.
while your at it, investigate that team Obama sent to interfere in the Israeli elections. double standards
Yes, we do. Thank you, Senator

hear hear!
Yes! But with GOP every where they won't do squat. If we were lucky they'd impeach Trump Pence/Ryan! ARGH
@HamiltonElector @StarTribune
it must be the Russians fault..obviously LOL
No proof Russia altered election, yet proof that DNC and HRC are corrupt and untrustworthy. Isn't that relevant??
Maybe not altered but interfered.Doesn't that worry you?How do you feel about the GOP coup in NC?
How did they interfere? They didn't hack the election results.
Hacking into Dem and congressional computers is not interfering?Tell yourself that.
so the information released from the DNC and on HRC is not worth addressing? That doesn't concern you?
Never said it wasn't worth http://addressing.You  mistake me for HRC voter.
if it's a cyber security issue then it should be addressed as such, not as a post election-issue.
Thank you Senator for advocating swift, bipartisan thorough special investigation of Russian interference in U.S. election
.@amyklobuchar @jeffjarvis @StarTribune We need independent inquiry - not run by the party of the Russian hack deniers.
@jeffjarvis @StarTribune And not in some committee that will die a slow death into obscurity. Must be independent & bipartisan
Russians have been interfering with our politics for 60 years. Where have you been?
You're a lawyer!You know people!Trump can't be inaugurated!Do something!Recruit Warren and attack.The longer,the tougher!Do it
And after the election, without any election at stake, this ought to command bipartisan support, not for the past, but future.
But, be prepared to limit the cost of doing the investigation.  Money needed for other more immediate government projects.
Then why don't we see you &Al on TV every day.Why aren't you screaming from the rooftops.Trump must be stopped now.Do it!Now!!
.@amyklobuchar We need an immediate & thorough investigation of whoever makes these terrible lede photos
Why isn't everyone in Congress demanding a full bipartisan investigation?
It seems Putin won the US election and Trump is his puppet! There must be an independent investigation.
Also follow the money for Trump and pro-Putin Congress people who did not do anything about it once it was known
@SasseePants @StarTribune Yes, but the likelihood of this happening w/ the GOP majority = low probability. #TheResistance
@realDonaldTrump we don't need any congressional investigations. we need a president who once before he leaves to be president
no govt $ to investigate FAKE stories. HRC & DNC rigged primary. Insider hack.  Wake up!
do not let Republican leaders thwart these investigations. We need the press and Dem leaders to fight hard for tr
how about northerm Minnesotans deserve a chance at high paying jobs, renew the leases.
@overrunbydogs @StarTribuneшхнннж
.@amyklobuchar @StarTribune It's about time we started hearing this from Dem leaders. We need urgent and forceful pushback.
Thank you Amy! Keep the heat on until it happens!
If they hacked the voting machines we'd have 2 do a offical recount. That would expose all the other skeltons.
if they interfered supportering trump them how did Hilbil win the pop vote?
To what end? If they just hacked the DNC what are u gonna do, close down the internet?
And we need to be implacable & relentless!
please keep pushing this! Democrats need to speak up more!
Thank you for pursuing this @amyklobuchar @StarTribune
yes we do!
Sometimes CIA & FBI job can makes us angry & mistrusted, but policy is fragile & complicated...
CIA & FBI are foundation of our democracy.  We cannot underestimated their accountability to ensuring safety 4 freedom...
Um, Amy, even corrupt Loretta Lynch ain't buyin' Russian interference. Get a grip #MNDFL http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/12/15/loretta_lynch_we_didnt_see_any_techincal_interference_from_russia_in_the_election.html … #stribpol
You're a democrat in name only.
agreed. We also need to investigate influence of illegals & illegible voters. Pass Voter I.D. laws.
Thank you!!!
I think Giuliani is behind it. "Cyber security specialist"=so he claims...https://www.yahoo.com/news/giulianis-foreign-complicates-candidacy-top-post-223835073--election.html …
Yes we do right away
Dem need to realize why there was so many that showed up at Trump"s rallys  and why many of us walked away from the Dem party
It's not just the Presidential election that was compromised!  http://nyti.ms/2hCPdx3 
If Trump is smart, he would agree Russian hacking took place to take heat off of himself. Denials beg questions of coverup
Hmmm, then why do both James Comey and Clapper say Russian interference is nonsense. I smell a Dem scam.
Yes we do. We need to find out for sure before he becomes President through th help of the Russians,
Hillary Clinton already said that trump was a puppet of puttin
heck yes Clinton should have won. I don't vote but that my strong opinion.
Yea, no. Not happening. Obama and Clinton left this country so compromised to foreign gov hacks they should both face charges.

@Deemoney521 @StarTribune and have given their implied consent to Judge Garland.
@Deemoney521 @StarTribune it's fair to conclude they waived right of advise/consent
@Deemoney521 @StarTribune But having chosen not to even hold hearings,
@Deemoney521 @StarTribune If Senate Rs have a problem w that, maybe they could have conducted hearings in last 8+ months
@Deemoney521 @StarTribune Senate Dems owe it to US & esp to President Obama to use this window of opportunity to confirm MG!
how about an immediate investigation into the DNC meddling in the election? massive voter fraud uncovered in Detroit recount
@Deemoney521 @StarTribune We also need the Senate Dems to confirm Merrick Garland as the absolute 1st order of business on 1/3
"IMMEDIATE" has to mean that -- as in, AHEAD OF DEC. 19TH EC votes OR - that date MUST get postponed. EMERGENCY
@Lee_in_Iowa @StarTribune Email the US Attorney General at:

https://www.justice.gov/doj/webform/your-message-department-justice …

We need to find the truth before 1/20.
The sooner the better.
.Whitehouse phone #  855.999.1663 direct abt releasing intell re Russia interference. Lines stay busy, keep em bz
YES, Senator, but NOW BEFORE this lunatic assumes the Presidency and America becomes unrecognizable.
#America needs a revote immediately. @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @SenWarren @RonWyden @SenJeffMerkley @DNCWomen
@HamiltonElector @StarTribune @CIA refuses  to inform Congress & is interfering in the election #7daysinmay
If we have to keep asking for this something is very wrong. @amyklobuchar @akl552
Sorry. I ranted about it on Facebook before election, emailed McCain and Flake, et al, but Party politics won.
@JumpTheRework @StarTribune back in the USSR
Once in office, DJT will be almost impervious to any effort to remove him. Should have been done weeks ago.
This needs investigated, but doubt will change anything. Repugnicans will block at every step, til inauguration.
@HamiltonElector @StarTribune AG Lynch, White House, FBI all noted no proof. Acting on this now only since #LyingHillary lost.
just like Hillary should be in jail ?
Agreed... but also disturbing to see all the emails and what they contained
And upgrade the way we talk about what Russia did from 'meddling,' which sounds like Scooby-Doo, to 'interference' which it is
Thank you for standing up for us! I'm so proud to be your constituent.
and how about coming up with a system that does not allow hacking to be possible from a foreign entity?
if you say so
no Russian interference your candidate sucked and you people still can't come to grips with your loss
maybe you shouldn't believe Trump Tweets. Proven fact: Trump tells the truth only 4% of the time. Ignorance is not bliss honey.
where is this proven fact proven at?
http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/ …
This is not proof, this is liberal politics..
facts are not liberal politics! Or Are you saying bold faced lying applies to the entire GOP?
Yes we do!!
Thank you for taking the right stand on this. This constituent appreciates it.
Yes, thank you!  And it needs to happen right away.
Too bad absolutely nothing will come of it. And we'll all be dead within 2 yrs.
@bval116 @StarTribune delay electoral college
Yes. I Agree!! Will THAT Actually Happen?? I think This IS THE Most CORRUPT Election I'VE Ever voted in-DISGUSTED
You need to investigate the Trump involvement, focusing on MANAFORT!
@HamiltonElector @StarTribune have you been sleeping all day today did you miss the news?
.@amyklobuchar @HamiltonElector @StarTribune BUMMER the "INTEL" community refused to show up at Congress today, genius.
@neeratanden yes we do
so #CrookedHillary was fine with unsecured email but the #DNCLeaks are the cause for the loss?!  Time to let go
@neeratanden Can some1 tell meY @POTUS,@LorettaLynch,& Dems generally seem2b ok w/it & Yvoters weren't informed b4 t/election?
Thank you Amy Klobuchar you make me even happier that I vote for you, thanks again
you're not too smart Obama knew about it for many months now
And voting for Trump screams high IQ
Also a better president would be a bonus too
DT did "aid" a hostile foreign pwr to "levy" cyber WARfare ag US electn.
Below is law re TREASON:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381 …
Thanks, Amy! -- a constituent

@neeratanden
@HamiltonElector so we are all saying this but who will do it before it's too late. Fight for the USA WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER

NOW! And an Electoral College delay by Congress .. do it! Talking Heads
@HamiltonElector Some electors running around like spoiled children because they lost and you think the CIA would consider? NO
And will you be the one to introduce it and pressure republicans to go there?
That pesky hacking may be unethical or illegal, but truth remains that the hacked material remains true. #CognitiveDissonance?
@neeratanden @StarTribune We need an immediate Court order to stop the Electoral College vote w/o an investigation.
@DavidPepper @StarTribune Special Prosecutor too, so charges can be brought.
Why did we not hear about this before the election, and why did the CIA cancel the mtg today with the Senate? More fake news?
This was announced officially Oct 7 - same day as Access Hollywood Tapes. 2nd debate and final debate also.
well we gave them a big hack button no wonder they did it, who would be able to resist pushing that big button
