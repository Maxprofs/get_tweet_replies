Everyone knows, you need to pass it to see what's inside. Remember?
Thank you. Secrecy isn't how our country should be governed.
Really?  That is how the b.o. bill was passed.
Maybe Obama shouldn't have screwed with his healthcare changes that DOUBLED my premiums....
That was your insurance company that F'd you, not 44.
BIG CORPORATIONS = Gained More Control, Profits, Cost Increases,  etc
Yes! We want to know!
Sorry u don't get to say anything in my book. U won't help my bro who  u put in prison because a home you recommended sold him pot. (Cont)
If you would've helped get the home my bro was in investigated for illegal activities I wouldn't be pissed at you,but you won't help fix it.
You care more about corporations, and money than people who are mentally ill or disabled. Like I said you're a joke. You make dems look bad.
If you would of fixed a problem you created by investigating @ZumbroHouseInc & @conken1 I wouldn't be tweeting you about how fake you are.
You'd rather see a mentally ill person not get any help by getting him thrown in prison because the home failed to do their job.
He's lost everything because of you, and made our life 100x harder for us because no one cares to help us. He was doing well until... (Cont)
He was put in a home you recommended that don't do their jobs. Now he has lost everything thanks to you.
Don't think it is should but Dems play so much politics and obstruct I can see how it can happen.  Path of least resistance. Work with Potus
Agree. Are Democrats prepared to present their own healthcare alternative so we may compare and contrast? Cant just gripe about Republicans
How we forget in a simple 7 yrs.  Posturing w/o solutions means nothing
Well the other one was stupid, so what difference does it make, we can't even afford to go in for anything anymore
Americans deserved to know the first time...
You have to pass it, to know what's in it... right??
Thanks Amy, keep fighting!
Why was ObamaCare drafted in secret?
#GOPDeathPanel
KEEP FIGHTING, SENATOR!
Thank you, Senator.  Keep up the good work.
Thank you
Please continue to push hard for it. #Dohealthcareright
We have to pass the bill, so we can find out what's in it. Sound familiar?
It does sound familiar!
Oh! We got to pass the the bill to see what's in the bill! Hypocrisy
So you would rather double down on a bad practice? Rather than learn from it and do differently for a different outcome?
Hello pot... meet kettle!
#HoldTheFloor for Wyatt and patients like him. He is disabled and benefits greatly from Medicaid as his secondary insurance. #SaveMedicaid
Aren't you the party that told us we needed to pass Obamacare to see what was in it?
In all fairness, that bill wasn't drafted in private. Healthcare is a joke in this country, copy a country that works, take your pick.
There were no Republican principles put into ObamaCare. No Republicans voted for it.
Doesn't make it okay this time just because Republicans are in charge. We'll be doing this all over again some day, you know it.
Took 70 years for Dems to finally succeed in trying to take over health care. I can wait.
Taking viable options away from many won't help your cause. Profits are more important than life? You a shareholder in med insurance co?
It was your side that took option away from most to serve a mere 25 million. At least be honest.
Took options away, you mean by requiring insurance? It was Reagan who signed the exec order which made Healthcare a right.
I agree!  Thanks for your advocacy!  We need to preserve Medicaid for our country's elderly and disabled.
This sounds vaguely familiar, "We have to pass it so you can see what's in it". I believe I heard this in 2009, but maybe that was fake news
Thank you for fighting for us! Everything about they are doing is so wrong and sickening.
FOIA that garbage Amy!
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar!
Such important legislation should be openly discussed @alfranken @MitchMcConell #UniversalHealthCare #StrongerTogether #accountability
Amy. Be real. The last healthcare bill "had to be passed to see what's in it" I'm not happy about it either, but this is politics today.
Nonsense. U reduce 2 yrs. of wrangling, 100 open session meetings and countless R amendments to a single out-of-context quote. Nice!
How about "if you like your doctor you can ('t) keep your doctor" ?
What about not cutting Medicaid? What about insurance for everyone? What about reducing deductibles and health care costs?
I remember back a time when Nancy Pelosi said we have to pass the bill before we'll know what's in it democratic hypocrisy
Quote taken out of context. The bill was right there for all to read, debate and amend, unlike today. #ShowUsTheBill!
Like we all got to see obama care before it was done
And we, the American people, are so very proud and grateful that you are one of those who is actually fighting for us!
Thank you!!!!!!!!!
Some murders are committed carefully & quietly, such as the health care bill 13 Republicans are trying to slide through
I live in your state. healthcare is out of control. $16,000 deductible + husbands $400 diabetes medicine is not covered. That is on you.
Thank you! I have stage 4 BC. #ShowUsTheBill #preexistingconditions #Ivote
Thank you Sen Klobuchar!
Too nice wtf ??  Do better
Thank you! My little brother has a prexisting condition and you are saving his life, and lives others like him, by keeping to #HoldTheFloor.
That's how it was drafted the first time
Killing this bill is vitally important. Then please move to reform ACA problems. Not done yet--counting on you. Thanks.
What do we know?

About the bill (we know @gop is thickheaded)
Stay on them! We do deserve to know.
Nancy Pelosi famously said... we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
Your side did the exact same thing when developing Obama Care. Inept
we have lost the freedom we once had. We are being led by fascist who lead under the cover of darkness drunk on power.
Yes. Keep up the good work.
It seem creepy that it's a secret
Remind @SenateMajLdr & your #GOP colleagues how they griped when they "only had" two months to review the #ACA #ObamaCare. #Resist hypocrisy
Remember Obamacare "We have to pass this bill to see what's in it"?
Stop your obstruction now. Quit wasting tax payer $$!
Thank you for standing up for Americans!   This SC family thanks you!
Thank you @amyklobuchar - make them #ShowUsTheBill! Don't leave until they do!
Thank you !!  Keep fighting for us !! #HoldTheFloor  #NoHearingNoVote
thank you but the vote must be stopped until the people see this bill
Dems didn't force ObamaCare for a vote with virtually no one reading it? That happened. Was a secret to those that signed it. Clearly.
As an American all I want to know is that our elected officials are working for us. Secret or not just get something done.
Keep it up!!! We need to know what's in this health care bill! Thank you for fighting for us!
Thank you!!
Whatever, just realize that in 2018, half of you (Rs & Ds) are probably going home. This is probably the worst US government since 2004.
thank you Amy! We need you and appreciate your efforts!
Thank you from Minnesota!!
#HoldTheFloor #resist  #insist #persist.
Thank you, Amy! We appreciate you back home in Minnesota #HoldTheFloor
Thank you, Senator - this is a horrible situation, I hope there is some way past it.
Let them know no we have rights we don't want to go backwards.
This health care Bill will affect ALL American's. 
Senate Repubs should not treat us like cattle going to slaughter!
Thank you for showing my MN Rep @RepErikPaulsen what true leadership looks like.
My goodness Jenni, that is an EXCELLENT pointI agree.
He doesn't seem to give a crap about us.
My idea?
#DemsGottaVOTE  
You hypocrite got to pass it before you know what's in it.
Did you tweet this back in '09 too?
yeah it's not some stupid fake reality show (or is it?) where someone comes in & redecorates your house w/o your input--this is life/death!
Thank you for standing up for the people. This is too important to do in secret. What are they hiding?
#HoldTheFloor We are with you Senator
Thank you! @alfranken @SenWarren @SenSanders
Thank you! Keep asking the hard questions for us.
Thank you. Minnesota Proud!#HoldTheFloor
Thank you!!!!
Thank you for listening to and fighting for your constituents like me. You are a shining example of our gov in action! 
Stay strong, Senator! We need you fighting for us now more than ever!
Go get 'em, Senator! #HoldTheFloor
"What difference does it make ?"  I'll tell u why - so the Democrats cant f--- it up a second time  
Thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you!
As always you are a class act!
You and the other  Democratic Senators and any reasonable Republicans must stop this bill! Stop business in the Senate, do what you can!
Remember how they criticized the way Obamacare was passed. They are such hypocrites
I remember trying to writ while the kids draw all over the paper, then have a fight . They were obstructing the process and it took forever
hello
Please do!! insurance in IA, can't afford Wellmark insurance giant. Can't go out of state. Medicaid cuts affect our disabled.
Give them heck, senator!
Oh my gosh is that a cubs baseball field
Thank you for fighting to get the health care bill into the light. Please don't stop fighting to stop this bill. #HoldTheFloor
The aggressor sets the rules. 

You were part of the aggressor gang when you crammed #Obamacare down #Americas throat

Quit whining.
@SenateGOP @SenateDems 
I don't want #Trumpcare 
This should NOT be done in secret!! 
Keep Fighting #Resist 
#Minnesota #55316
Why not cosponsor @SenSanders #MedicareForAll  Bill? 60% of Americans and 80% of Dems support. Who do you represent if not the people?
Kinda like Obamacare right Amy
Precisely !!
"WE HAVE TO PASS IT TO SEE WHAT'S IN IT" Deja Vu!
America needs to look to other countries to see what it means to have healthcare. Insurance is a waste of money. Time for universal health!
Fantastic idea! But that would mean America will "copy" and that's not what @realDonaldTrump 's "make america great again" mean.
Thank you!
Good job Amy. Minnesotans love you and we're proud of your work.
Thanks Amy.
#IaDemsAdoptMnSens
MY life depends on it AMY!!! #HoldTheFloor
When did legislating in secret become a thing?
Speak as loud and long as possible. And keep calling it #Trumpcare. It has to stick to him.
Based on last 150d of Media Leaks, innuendo, & hyperbolic issue exploitation would a legitimate/honest floor debate occur?
Go Amy! You and @alfranken and everyone else who has the courage to stand up to this horrible the GOP is ramming down our throats!
We deserve and demand to know!
Thank you, Senator! Make Minnesotans proud and #HoldTheFloor
Thank you!!
Thank you! Please continue to do everything you can to not let this pass. #HoldTheFloor
Speaking as disabled MN constituent w/pre-existing conditions, your obstruction of this bill is vital and will save lives. #HoldTheFloor
Perhaps if the Democratic party had an agenda other than "resist", you would have been included
You sound like Al!
Thank you! Nevertheless she persisted
Shut it down.
Please continue to do everything you can to make them release the full contents of this bill. It is outrageous and beyond hypocritical.
Thank you Senator!
Agreed. Do the right thing and #ShowUsTheBill @JeffFlake and @SenJohnMcCain! #VoteNoAHCA
The American public will not accept the results
Why? You already know the answer and they won't talk about it. Be more productive and hire the Shame lady from GoT to follow them around.
Thanks for being there for our children and our elderlies,for being the voice of the  voiceless.may God bless you with wisdom trough this .
Thanks, Amy! As your constituent, I expect you to fight hard to protect my health care!
@SenateMajLdr makes me cry. Lying. Hates Obama so much he's taking away my healthcare which will kill me. What has happened to our country?
Yes, Senator Klobuchar, we do deserve to know.  Thank you for doing your part to keep the process fair.
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
#HoldTheFloor
Thanks for all you do, Senator
Agree, but did U ask same Q? when Obama forced plan down the throats of America? & Pelosi said must pass bill to know what's in it? Dementia
Forced down our throats? ACA bill was open, debated, amended, passed by House and Senate, signed by President. #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you!! My senators only answer to their party.
Thank you, Senator! #HoldTheFloor
Very simple, Amy. So you can't block the repeal and replace. @alfranken @StarTribune @MinnesotaDFL @kenmartin73 @GovMarkDayton @nytimes #ap
Please keep demanding transparency
Thank you! Please keep it up - we need you!
Thank you. Now when is vote-a-Rama? We need thousands of amendments
Thank you Senator. Keep DOING for us!
Keep up the fight, Senator Klobuchar!
Thank you!  The annual/lifetime CAP will be devastating for cancer patients such as myself who hope that their remissions remain stable.
Because no matter what it says you won't vote for it!
And then they're quick to accuse the Democrats of being divisive!!
Excellent - thank you and hold the floor!
DO NOT LET THIS PASS!!  #HoldTheFloor
We appreciate your efforts!!!
