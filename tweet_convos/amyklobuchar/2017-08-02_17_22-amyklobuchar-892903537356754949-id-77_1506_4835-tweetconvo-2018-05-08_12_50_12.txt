I’ve signed on to a bill sponsored by @AmyKlobuchar that's aimed to lower prescription drug costs for seniors.
Thank you both for your leadership in the Senate and in th . You make me proud. 
I just picked up my parents meds!!  OMG!  Thank you for trying to lower these costs. Their meds, maintenance meds, are crazy expensive!!
And those of us with pre-existing conditions Thank You!
Thanks to the both of you! I enjoyed your questioning during the confirmation of attorney general sessions… Absolutely loved it#Supporter
Wait till trump get his hands on big pharmacy again shcki dropped the ball
You both are greatly appreciated!
As a senior, this will be a major help for me. Thank you!
How old is senior in your book?
60+
When I was 50, the grocery gave discount to those 55+. When I was 55, I asked. They said that it was 60+. At 60 this year they said 65+. Him
Why can't the bill lower Rx costs for everyone? We all need a break from the price gouging that's going on. Chronic disease pts, especially!
If your buddy @CoryBooker would not have voted against your last proposal we would have had lower drug options already.
Thank you
Thank you both!
Thank you both for your unwavering patriotism and support for the American people that you serve.
Latest thing to look at: why r cost & restrictions on syringes skyrocketing? Use for allergy maintenance. Can no longer fill 100 script.
Pharmacies want to restrict to 6 at a time even though script says 100! Or go to doc for injections. ALL cost patients more.
Thank you Senators! Thats the way to get H.C. costs down! #SaveACA

Lowering cost for elderly... What about everyone else, do we now pay more?
@AARP @AARPadvocates @VP @POTUS Thanks to both of you Senators for showing leadership on this issue that our potus did not care about
Thank both of you
Women power.
Thanks Sen, Klobuchar and Sen, Harris. I wish we had a president that would help us instead of sending us back in time. This is needed,
I would love to thank all of the great women in the Senate and house who stands up to Trump
Bless that women's heart! Inhalers shouldn't be almost 400!!!!
Lower drug costs for everyone. Families with kids need to buy more scrips.
Can we just get lower drug costs for everyone?
Thank you.
Did it ever occur both of you to rise up and become the face of the Democratic party? I'm an IND for 8 yrs  and leadership hasn't changed.
Women get things done. 
@KTynot @SenKamalaHarris What about the Canadian bill sponsored by Bernie Sanders 4 everyone that Cory Booker, 12 Dems vetoed
How about lowering costs for all !
Not as long as there's a huge profit motive.
You rule!
Thank you! Please advise, what is the bill so I can write to my Senators to support it?

Do you think it's possible to pass laws that control prescription drug costs? @lovemusic_mc8 #NMMUCLA
Let's see how long it takes for Bernie to claim credit.
Thank you ladies for doing this
Great work, ladies! Could you also lower them for juniors?
Thank you both!
Ladies of the #Senate keep getting it done. #Resist.
Thank you !!!
Lower prescription costs for everyone.
Thank you!
Both of you should run for president!
Yes, thank you, ladies. Where would we be without our women legislators? Abigail Adams would be kvelling!
And women get it done! Thanks ladies
Thank you for all you do for working people.
Knowing these people, it probably works by taking the money out of working white males bank accounts. Because we are so privileged
I hope it works, now all you have to do is get it passed! #EasyRight
This would be LIFE CHANGING.
Thank you both for strong leadership and unwavering commitment.
Lower corporate, subsidized, toxic food. Increase grants for local, chem free growers. Decrease need for drugs.
Erh why just seniors?
Good work by my former and present Senators
A great team.Almost reminds one of the Obama/Biden team...Harris/ Klobuchar, or Klobuchar/Harris 2020.Take your pick.Both very smart Lawyers
It's sad that the elderly has to pay such high cost for living while other countries control prescription drugs cost .
Why are drug companies allowed to advertise on television?
I agree, I think they spend more on advertising then for r&d.
They have the right but I wonder about the ROI for doing so.
The ROI is crap, but a marketing team w/o DTC is going to get hammered by leadership who is more worried about their stock options
In our country, profits are far more important than the health of citizens. We are not able to make moral decisions at the executive level.
Formidable team for 2020.
Exactly how are you going to do that?  Are you manufacturing drugs?
Glad she signed. but you both need to demand universal healthcare now
Freda, you don't get it; 13 Dem shills led by @CoryBooker & @PattyMurray were just bribed in Jan to kill an Rx Import Bill.
They're owned.
Please watch & RT this video of the awesome @SenKamalaHarris
You women are keepin ' it real in D.C. , thank you!
Good job ladies
Good job for what? The bill doesn't do anything that will guarantee lower drug prices. It's all an act to appease the "useful idiots"
If drugs cost less, seniors can actually afford to buy them, thus better health for seniors (which lowers healthcare costs). Win-win!
are @TheDemocrats planning on totally leaving disabled high & dry...I rarely see us be a consideration re: @SocialSecurity or @MedicareGov.
Ladies getting it done!
It seems like it,
Thank you!
How about life saving drugs for children #epipen
@PaulBegala @CNN @igorvolsky thank you
