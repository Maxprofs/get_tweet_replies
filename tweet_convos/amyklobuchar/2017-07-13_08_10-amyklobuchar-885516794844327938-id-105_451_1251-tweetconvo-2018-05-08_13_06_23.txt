You mean you're more focused on convicting a trump family member than worrying about the concerns of your own constituents? #Typical. IJS
Convicting treasonous people in the highest office is thejob of Senate and a concern of most of her constituents. Ones that love democracy
If that is true "doctor", Hilary would be in an orange jumpsuit eating porridge every day. You are a hypocrite
I'm okay with Hillary going to jail if found she broke the law, but you have to do better than,  "yea, but Hillary. . ."
At what point is it all too much for the Pres to say he didn't know what was going on? Either complete incompetence or willful ignorance.
But weaponizing the IRS and Clinton Foundation...not so much.
There is no bottom. This is a MÃ¶bius strip of deflection. Please, keep pushing yourself out the door with this nonsense.
Yes, impartial justice must prevail!
Agree
Were you as vocal when Hillary deleted 30,000 of her emails after being stupid enough to have a server in her house?
Gosh!  As serious as Batman croaks.  U must change into ur Super Amy kit.  Or, u may prevail upon me at volleyball, if u and Sen.Harris getm
"DD probed me with her grabasstic blue-state digits."  Continue!  Don't forget to aim me, at the critical moment, hon.
Dennis Montgomery, James Comey, Loretta Lynch, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama. Tick tick tick
Dude.  Are you Danny Aykroyd bait?  Just asking.
No more Batman?  Send for Letterman!  Retired?  Howdy ho, get the WWE, but no . . . that Trump guy is wearing 'em, Amy.  Do u gotta check?

Are the Democrats really going to let this go and start running this country ? how many millions of dollars/time have they wasted on this
Thank you Senator from one of your constituents!
Hope you still feel that way when HRCs involvement comes to light. #CarefulWhatYouWishFor
Serious? It's absolutely nothing! Dishonest Dems would sell their own souls, if they had souls, to make the Trumps look bad. You lost.
More #FakeNews .. this isn't serious ... it is more Democratic Hyperbole #FakeNews #DemocratsPartyofHate
You're a Russian bot or traitor.
Not a Russian, not a traitor, but I am a #Patriot 
Hahahahahaha.
Its just left wing crybaby bullshit and you know it. Face it!! You lost!
Thank you for the good fight!
Thank you Amy! Sooner the better will help bring back the country I want!
Calling Sen.A-Meat!  Enquiring folks want to know!  What in f is Ivanka doing, married to a guy version of Maddow-dog?  Seems odd.  +Sad!
Shouldn't we ask Sen.Al Franken JUST HOW SERIOUS is this political blocking stuff you have yet to define, to continue, given PLATOON?
Thank you, Senator.  I hope you encourage your colleagues to do the same.
Republicans  in collusion too, and Trump will get away with anything, who will stop him? Fake news that his followers believe, 
sad.
More fake news and surely you can't be serious!  Lets investigate the Dem's collusion with the Ukraine if we're going down the rabbit hole.
They are all in it up to their necks. All. Of. Them. The entire GOP.
It's only serious to the obstructionists.
Senator, please look into Chris Wray's past Russian clients before confirming him. He did not appear hard on Russia yesterday.  Pass along.
Maybe we need a wall in Alaska to keep them out?
Witch hunt. You do this to destroy Potus and waste our money to do it. You lost. Get over it. Dem party disgusting right now.
Good Grief.  It is so refreshing that you Dems are ALWAYS squeaky clean. Can you all walk on water as well? @danobrien1972 @Loren_Jorgensen
Where was all the SEARCHING INTO UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR. WITH. HILARY??? HER ANTICS OVERLOOKED TOTALLY..
The Trumps are #americasfamily. The Dems are losers, liars, and whiners. Stop spreading fake news!
Not my Senator...seriously. You need to stop the obstruction and this Russian charade. This is as low as you can get.
And by the way.  Doing nothing while Americans were slaughterd was SERIOUS.  Ya didnt want an investigation then?  You are UNAMERICAN


"Republicans block effort to revoke Jared Kushner's security clearance". Can Intel Committee or FBI do anything to help revoke? Anyone?
Enough GOP stonewalling!
Thank you Sen Klobucher for focusing on this and stressing how critical it is that we get to the bottom of it. We appreciate your work!
@alfranken @RepJasonLewis Please do all you can in the Senate and House to get to the bottom of this serious threat to our National Security
Thank you Senator Klobuchar for all you do to protect Minnesotans and Americans. Proud to have you as our senator!
Yes we do. All this is just awful!
How naive the US press is to think Putin and his comrades would admit to their meddling of our election. Why would they do that ?
The DNC running a candidate who could not be certified on 1-6-2017 under the 20 Amendment is serious, everything after is just noise.
Thank you Senator Klobuchar
Each day another story appears showing evidence of conspiracy, collusion, obstruction, cover-up re: Trump & Russia. Please stay on the case.
This can only end with Kushner having his security clearance revoked, whether the President likes it or not, and MUST end with him in jail
If even partial honesty were a part of the DNC platform then maybe this BULLSHIT would go somewhere.  #ShellGame
Yawn
I support all your efforts to find the truth-important 4 our democracy
Yes. Thank you for saying so. #TrumpRussia #KremlinGate #RussianCollusion #RussiaGate #ObstructionOfJustice
Thank you
Shouldn't there be a legal device to remove certain lifetime placements if it's found that a president was fraudulently elected?
Keep speaking out! I am so proud to have you as one of my United States senators!
@amyklobuchar @timkaine @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @alfranken @NancyPelosi @repjohnlewis @SenWarren @SenSchumer STRIP HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE
And ask why @SpeakerRyan is dodging whether he had any meetings with Russians. How deeply entwined is the GOP and Russian gov?
What about his security clearance in the meantime
#LockThemAllUp #TrumpRussiaCollusionConfirmed #25thThe45th #MakeHillary46th
This is very serious if it develops into anything!
Saw you on Morning Joe this am-smart, thoughtful commentary. Making MN women look good!
Non-story
Yes, Sen. Klobuchar. The investigation must continue without interference.
Impossible to get to the bottom of a black hole
Thank you!! Erika, i feel maybe a few GOP are still honest @SenatorCollins  & @lisamurkowski are 2 who Ive started 2include on all my tweets
Hey Amy u know @McClatchyDC have been on top of things fir a long time... had a whole series of stories '02-'03 showing no WMD
Caught you on Morning Joe this morning 
Keep up the good work @amyklobuchar
More unfounded accusations without any evidence.Time for Trump to issues several pardons so investigation on Russia can proceed. #FakeNews
Thank you for your steady and intelligent voice. You are part of the future of our country!
#IndependentCommission
Hey fyi from se mn I got your back with a lot of others. Thank you for doing a great job.
Not just this but Sessions must resign! You shouldn't be heading the @TheJusticeDept if you can't uphold justice yourself.
We get it.  They have met and done business with people from Russia.  Crying wolf every day diminishes the real issues facing the US
Russia launches rockets that bring US astronauts to space station. Doesn't that qualify as doing business with Russians?
Is there progress being made on these investigations?  It seems like things are moving so slowly.
In the meantime, no confirmation of nominees from this illegitimate officeholder.
Google Brad Parscale and read extensive research on him by citizen journos. It IS serious. #electionhack
WOW this is serious not a lot of reporting on story yet ?
Many people believe everything they read.So typical of Trump campaign to play on the uninformed and use all venues to deceit voters.

Keep telling yourself that.
Yes please. Incomprehensible
Stop! Americans are hurting. Work on jobs, healthcare, economy, tax codes. Regardless of your hate for the Trumps , these are the concerns.
Treason is national security.
This part of the complex connections is where the collusion rubber meets the road.
Story not getting enuf play is why Sessions settled Russia money-laundering case for pocket change after firing @PreetBharara 
@NatDialogues
Can someone please move to suspend his clearance???
Thank you Ms. Klobuchar, I was wondering when Minnesota would weigh in.
Are there no honest @GOP left? Please keep fighting for our country as you have been. Thank you for all you do. #ThursdayThoughts
Erika don't despair, I think 2 honest GOP are @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski I include em on tweets.they have thumb on pulse of the people
I couldn't agree more
