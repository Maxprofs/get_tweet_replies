what is the new administration doing while people are blinded with outage?  #shockevent
Thank you for standing against the Muslim Ban.
can't the executive be compelled to give us the reasons they chose these 7 countries??
Check with Obama, his choice!
Democrats are a bunch of damn LIARS. Lets talk about the Obama Iraq ban and the Carter Iran ban. Just shut up.
@lavndrblue @SenFranken u know then, how imperative it is 2 vote NO on the remaining djt cabinet pcks. We r watching u dems!
Keep watching them lose!!!
Where were you when Obama drew up and signed this order!?  Hypocrite.
Indeed! It's called selective memory!
No it should not be reversed
so make it happen by putting pressure on Trumps nominees - stall them out.
please reject ALL nominations until the ban is revoked. This is outrageous.
Poor thangs -America First!
Oh boo freaking hoo. Lucky to be in #America!!
Why aren't you pushing for more support of our vets?  That's were our support needs to go.
You are wrong
Do something about HIM!
Yes!Trump in 2020!
Unity . together we stand. We are strong together.
Thank you for responding to this serious wrongdoing.
BAGS OF HOT AIR
Please speak up loudly and forcefully against Trump's ban of refugees and immigrants.  No Minnnesota nice!
Too late! America first!
Call for impeachment!
time to call for impeachment. We need you to rise to this occasion.
thank u both for stepping up . Now pls vote no regarding  Tillerson and Sessions for cabinet posts.
Hooray for Sessions and Tillerson!!!!!!
do you also represent those of us who dont agree with you? Doesn't feel like it
flood the nation with refugees, give them whatever they need for free and let them vote! Great progressive plan!
-- thank you for being on the right side of history re: Muslim and refugee ban
disappointed to not see @RepErikPaulsen involved with this.
Thank you Sen. Amy!
Thank you for traveling here for to show MN that you recognize how important this is!
http://www.lovepeaceharmony.com  be love; carry love; spread love.  No law is more powerful than love.
thank you for speaking out
Trump is a danger to Democracy. We must take a tougher stance. He's only one man & his legitimacy is questionable!
can you look into what can be done about the border patrol not following the federal court order?!
Doesn't the stay accomplish that, at least for now?
Nice exploitation of innocent children... Anything to get your agenda out yes? You are worse than Trump.
Thank you!!!
Remember Deathocrats refusing term "Muslim" describing countries exporting Jihadist terror? Now claim "Muslim ban"
Thank you. Begin impeachment process
Thank you for standing up for everything that makes us great.
you mean the way you demanded Obamas junk orders be repealed?
do you ever look at things in a bipartisan way? Maybe you should try it sometime!
oh I forgot Obama never had an executive order you didn't like.
Vote no on Rex Tillerson. Call back Sessions for questioning -- will they uphold this? You have power to stop this
No they don't, the dems fixed that during their reign, hahahahaha
Refugees do not have the right to be here!!!
I typed it slowly so even Al Franken can read it..
what's the best way to help?
With the large & beautiful diversity of MN, including our many Muslim neighbors, we need you now more than ever
thank you both for your leadership. Minnesota is lucky to have you as our senators.
no we must move forward and protect American people lives!!!!
People are being detained without counsel at MSP, please help!
thank you - get in front of news to send message to citizens how residents are impacted
so you aren't concerned about proper vetting for the safety of our country? And you didn't take issue when BHO did
Are you co-sponsoring Feinstein's bill reversing the EO and taking some unilateral powers from #BannonsPuppet?
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 banned  discrimination against imm'grnts on basis of national origin.
keep up the good work!
@mch7576 @SenFranken What are you doing to stop him?
Where were those same tears for Kate Steinle?  She's dead.  No one died here...Maybe inconvenienced. Hypocrisy !
How are you planning to reverse it? I've had my fill of platitudes. Time to act.
Thank you. Now, please stop supporting cabinet picks. Just say NO to hatred, bigotry, injustice.
America first bigot!
please stop voting for his nominees.  #muslimban #ResistTrump
Thank you for meeting with your constituents during this time. @RepErikPaulsen Take note.
Lovely. This is what leadership looks like.
What is the plan? We need to hear from Congressional Dems. @Tina49747372 @SenFranken
Thanks to the both of you for your compassion.
Thanks to both of you for your representation of MN!  We are with you!
Please fight this ban!
You both are smart and brave. Please figure out what to do now. We need you!
Smart and brave? Hahahaha
@Politics_PR @SenFranken  Wow! Never thought I would see this day! I guess nothing is new under the sun? You all saw it coming
Trump and Bannon want chaos. Stop Them!!!!
Chaos is good! America first!
@patch1774 @SenFranken yes. Heartbreaking. Lol. Poor refugees. They may have to stay in their own country for 120 days. Boohoo
thank you for #Standingup against this abomination to our brothers and sisters.
DO something. You need to hit the ground running tomorrow and DO something, senators. Your voters are watching.
It is time for Congress to lead!  Banning immigrants goes against the foundation of our Country!
He is really starting to piss me off !!!
@DearAuntCrabby @SenFranken I thought you people in Legislative Branch had equal power under the Constitution!!!
What will you be doing about it besides making statements and showing sympathy?
@DearAuntCrabby @SenFranken Thank you so much!
Gee, who's in a position to do reverse it? Wait...You 2 are! Get the Dems drafting legislation to do just that.
maybe Saudi Arabia,  Iraq, Iran, and China will nuke the new America Russia communist.

we used to live in America now it's American Russian communist disgust
What more can we do to stop it?
#/BoycottEverythingTrump
Thank you! U of M students may need help returning home or returning to the US. Please keep them in mind.
Do Not Vote In another cabinet member!
Thank you @amyklobuchar & @SenFranken for your leadership. #AmericaWelcomes #NoBanNoWall
.@SenFranken and I met w/Minnesotans impacted by refugee ban today. Heartbreaking. This order is causing chaos and must be reversed. 
Thank you!
Hi, Senator. May Patch have permission to use this photo in our stories?
Get this fixed!! Hasn't Trump done enough? I would love to see him arrested.
Amy for POTUS 2030 - if the Republic survives that long.
Thank you. This gives me hope â€“ but let's see if your actions speak as loud
thank you both, the live video was a great way to reach out.
Then stand up and speak out loudly and incessantly.
Thank you for speaking out amidst the silence and the hate. #NoBanNoWall #SpeakOut #resist #FightTheHate
thank you for standing up for immigrants and refugees! #resist #NoBanNoWall
Obama did the same in 2011 with refugees from Iraq... but for 6 months. Where was your outrage then?
Really? I can't find a single believable source for that.
Sen. @ChrisMurphyCT said he will introduce a bill to overturn it. Will you co-sponsor? Thank you for your leadership thus far.
So what are you and @SenFranken doing about it besides voting in favor of Trump's nominees?
No chaos, little over 100 affected of millions traveling, on 1st day of implementation to  prevent terrorism
And?  We are waiting for some leadership in congress. How about tomorrow?
You both voted to confirm John Kelly as DHS head. What's he doing today to help??
#ResistTrumpNow @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @keithellison 

#ITMFA #NoBanNoWall  #MuslimBan
I'm not afraid of Muslims. I'm afraid of democrats who are against vetting to make sure they don't want to kill me
I loved your speech.
Yes, & you & other sens. could stop capitulating to cabinet picks who will drive this & more. Obama comparisons are false equiv. OBSTRUCT!
get him out of office please he's a traitor! #russiagate #lockhimup #resist #showyourtaxreturns
Sadly, will probably not be reversed, but must be adjusted/clarified to help regular people.  @Reince
may I also suggest respective staff's look over the changes announced today with the National Security Council.
The law dictates two people who must be included. They are the head of the Joint Chiefs and CIA.
Please help us and everyone not so lucky. We need to see you fight back.
Please do all you can!
maybe legislators representing citizens should do something???
Proud of my old home state, Minnesota right now.  You and Al keep up the good work!  ;-)
Try to WORK WITH FORWARD LOOKING REPUBLICANS @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain #StopPresidentBannon
Yes @amyklobuchar @SenFranken absolutely right. Now stop voting for his cabinet nominees #NoBanNoWall
.@SenFranken and I met w/Minnesotans impacted by refugee ban today. Heartbreaking. This order is causing chaos and must be reversed. 
Thank you Senators!
