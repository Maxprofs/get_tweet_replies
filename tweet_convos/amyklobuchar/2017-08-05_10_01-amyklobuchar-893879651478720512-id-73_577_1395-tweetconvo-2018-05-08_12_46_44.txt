I'm sure @POTUS will have some uplifting and encouraging words to say about this tragedy- NOT!
What tragedy? It was a broken window being propagated to fulfill an agenda, as usual! #FalseFlag #JustineDamond #PedoGate #CapitalCriminals

What a tragedy, terrorism is still terrorism when committed against muslims.
Christian terrorists are terrorists too.
Whoever did this was NOT a Christian, no matter if he/she thinks so.
Probably working on their own bombs in the basement and you find a way to turn it into something to stand by the for? They should raid them!

Love Trumps Hate 
Even more than losing elections?
No word from the hard-at-work President yet on this act of terrorism
Fake news said that the people in the mosk  were  conducting classes on how to blowup buildings, when one of the bombs exploded.
Damn lady... Yah gotta Lotta bots defending you. Wonder what Minnesotans really think? You've destroyed Hennepin county, that's what!
And not surprising, silence from the leaders of the white supremacists, President Bannon and Mr. Trump.
It is sad to see this anywhere, but truly sad for all open hearted Minnesotans. I thank god no one was physically hurt.
My prayers for our citizens in MN. We are with you. Thank you @amyklobuchar
Sorry we aren't so good at being more like Jesus. He was kind and loving to people. We try. We stand with you. We try to love as He loved us
Where is @realDonaldTrump tweet condemning act of terrorism? Bloomington Islamic Center

I am sad that this happened in my home state and am sorry for this hateful action and the ignorant tweets. WWJD?
Thank you for standing with Muslims against hatred.
Probably Muslims that set it off anyways to distract from Noor
Absolutely ridiculous... should people hate any group no... but this Muslim community in Minnesota has got to go... !!!
yes and support the cop who shot the woman in her drive way
We thank Sen Amy Klouchar for your support for the Muslims in MN, Oh! All Mighty Creator accept all our prayers and bless her
Will @POTUS say anything about these American terrorists trying to murder Muslims? Crickets...
Hope they catch the guilty. The hatred behind this is of the devil - really evil.
Thank God. That is sad & shameful. You are all welcome here no matter what #theOrange1 says. We have you n our hearts this is your home!
Relieved there are no injuries - I hope the community comes together to support the mosque members.
False Flag most likely FBI false flag terrorists
Somali Muslims Rape game in MN protect women Amy?
.@truth
So sad for our fellow Americans. Hate crimes are so counterproductive to the goal of unity. So much respect for Amy Klobuchar and MN.
These are our neighbors. Don't mess with them.
So sorry this happened. Hope all are well & know that MOST USA supports them & their right to worship their way.
No one should feel unsafe in their house of worship. I stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters. County has already offered  assistant.
Who is we. You never wrote about bombings when it involved none Muslim American Citizens. How about just keeping your bigotry to yourself.


A Trump supporting terrorist beleiveing he will be a republican folk hero for coming an act of terror and that Trump will pardon him.
So where's a comment from @potus @realDonaldTrump condemning this obvious act of terrorism?
Where you have Islam you have terrorism and bombings. Is anyone really even surprised anymore?
Not a blast...a terrorist attack and hate crime. Call it like it is
what's the best way to donate to rebuilding/recovery efforts?
REAL Christians and REAL Americans will stand up for them and rebuild their center..
REAL Americans and REAL Patriots  don't want them in our country! So glad I moved out of that #Libtard state 2 years ago! 
This started with destroyed  Grave stones all over the country and Trump said nothing now it's escalated to this.
Happy no Injuries. Such a shameful act @RandyBKantor
Society have learned nothing from are past
Let's stop Trump blasting and use all MN resources and Fed resources and find out who did this
Agreed. Similar to terrorist attacks! What a stupid and moronic act of violence. Catch him and send him to Guatanamo Bay!
Wonder who set off the blast and for what reason
Looking for someone to call it what it is...
I agree. Obviously another hate crime hoax. Getting tired of it.

When you have "the president of the US of A",Trump, continuing to incite violence against minorities this is where & what the trolls resort.
You mean like fake President #Obama did when cops were being killed and he said nothing?!?!
Jesus I'm coming home next week for my grandmothers funeral.  What is going on there?! FFS
I'm glad nobody was hurt. Very scary attack. Terrorism of all ideologies must be denounced.
Terrorism?
Happy to hear that all safe & sound.
Sickening to see this happening in my home state.
Sending prayers.
People Suck!!!
A cowardly act of terrorism. Shame.
We stand with our Muslim neighbors in Minnesota. Or as we more commonly call them, Minnesotans. We are ready to help in any way we can.
Senator @amyklobuchar, Minnesota is better than this. America is better than this. It's like burning black churches and Jewish synagogues.

Oh, no. We stand with your community all across the country. #HateHasNoHomeHere
Glad no one was injured.  This kind of thing is just wrong
@StarTribune should call it what it is. Terrorism.
Indeed. Please comment on this @amyklobuchar
