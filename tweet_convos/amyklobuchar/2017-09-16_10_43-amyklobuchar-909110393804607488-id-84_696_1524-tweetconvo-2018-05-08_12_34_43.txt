JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
Then how about joining @SenFranken and sponsoring @SenSanders #MedicareForAll bill?
Because it's a waste of energy. It won't pass this term. Let's focus on making Dems actually democratic so we can win elections.
Supporting single payer is supposed to be a democratic issue. But you're right. Sponsoring it would probably consume all of her energy.
Priorities matter. Doing things in the wrong order can destroy an agenda. We need a /d/emocratic party. We need money out of politics.
While we're letting ourselves be distracted by a bill that has no chance, establishment Dems are cementing their control of the party.
If we don't replace the current Democrat leadership, we'll /never/ get #MedicareForAll.
Democrats in Virginian are trying to bypass the primaries bc they don't want a progressive to get nominated. Party reform must come first.
Dems in Calif. used appointed delegates to overrule elected delegates and install a pharma lobbyist as chair. Party reform must come first.
Lets get govt. Out of health care buis.....
And let the consumer and privatised providers work it out .
We need to get the profit makers out of our healthcare.
Yes ....starting with greedy govt. Reps and pharm. Gluttons
To me this seems a case of stupidly going round in circles and delaying moving other areas forward that would benefit America. If the

Thank you from all of us not in MN. We need Senators who are for us too. Tell us what you need us to do.
Medicare for all!
HOLEY SOMETHING OR ANOTHER! That defies any common decency!
Yes.  We need to call, tweet, email or fax every senator we can reach.  This is dangerous to our most vulnerable citizens.  #resist
I'm shaking after reading that: Hey, I'm 70, legally blind, had a heart attack , stroke, have a bunch of autoimmune diseases. I'd DIE!
We will ALL fight for you.  I know @amyklobuchar and @SenFranken are fighting.   #TheResistance is fighting too.
Thank you for your opposition! Stay strong.
Thank you, Senator. Please continue to stand firm against the GOP attempts to eviscerate the ACA.
This Repub plans just kills people faster. So out of touch & reality.
Thank you!
@ASlavitt rural communities need better access to affordable insurance and care. Example, what's going on in Albert Lea.
#ProtectOurCare until we can implement #MedicareForAll S1804 & H.R.676! which both Sen.Al @alfranken & Rep. @keithellison Co-sponsored
Thank you
Depends how you handle the block grants . As a leftist democrat you tend to spend more then you have. Maybe no illegals?
Why 2026?  So they can fool the public for the 2018, 2020, 2024 elections??
Thanks for fighting against this terrible bill. #ProtectOurCare
@ASlavitt thank you!!! Keep fighting this life-saving fight!
Thank you. Healthcare in US shouldn't cost as much as housing. Those with pre-existing conditions need to be included in affordable coverage
Thank you, Senator. Please do everything that you can this week to stop this. We are counting on you!
Is the proposal that the GOP wanted to give money to states and go forward with that. If so it could fund Minnesota care. Right?
This bill would mean certain death for me. Please stop this. I like living. Thank you.
Too bad @LindseyGrahamSC doesn't fight for SC'ians #ProtectOurCare  #ProtectMedicaid #MedicaidMatters
I wish you wouldn't, you and all the other Democrats are not very good at this Healthcare thing...
Why do elderly people get carded in MN? #disrespectful
Thank you Senator Klobuchar for fighting for affordable Health Care for Minnesotans and all Americans with pre-existing conditions.
And Congress must NOT be exempted from pariticipating in whatever comes next!
@LindseyGrahamSC You need to read this!  We live in a mobile society, we need universal healthcare for all.  The people have spoken.
This is useful focus: defending against the horror, NOT wasting time with empty single-payer gestures before the system is ready.
lol

Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
Does this mean you will co-sponsor @SenSanders's #MedicareforAll Act? We sure hope so, @SenFranken has done it.
I'm fighting to #ProtectOurCare for those w pre-existing conditions, for MN families who rely on Medicaid, for millions who'd lose coverage. https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/908072873964826624 …
Thanks, Senator. We need your leadership now more than ever.
Thanks. The focus now has to be on saving the ACA
I'm disappointed you're not on board with @SenSanders #MedicareForAll Act. Join us! Health care is a right!
Thanks so much! Please fight hard! From a self-employed 56 yr old cancer survivor. @SenFranken
Thank you! Fervently hoping @lisamurkowski and @SenCapito are on board with you!
Will you be joining @SenFranken in cosponsoring @SenSanders' Medicare for all bill?
@kevinomccarthy  see?
You go, Senator. Keep fighting!
Keep  fighting !
#getonit #MedicareForAll
There is legislation in the Senate you could co-sponsor a piece of legislation that makes all this repeal the ACA talk moot.#MedicareForAll
Keep fighting Amy! If my son didn't have ins  thru work I don't know what he would do he had a heart attack at 37
Thank you @amyklobuchar because you fight for MN families and ALL Americans!  #ProtectOurCare #Fight4OurHealth #ACA.
The GOP is obviously not trying to get everyone coverage. Thanks Amy
@repmarkpocan @SenatorBaldwin Counting on you to ensure all Americans have health care, not just wealthy Americans.
"Fight" is the most abused English word. Used to describe killing in a war, and debate in the legislature. It's supposed to describe hockey!
Please talk to your friend senator McCain
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you Senator!
@ASlavitt Amy, dems r 4 hugely expensive & inefficient sgl payer. Will ruin this country. Give it up.
Thank you! As a person with a medical condition your efforts are appreciated. This is wearing us down!! #ProtectOurCare
This looks alot like the bill before. It probably is worse .  They penalize profitable states to shift the money to failing Red states.
What are you doing to get the MN waiver for the reinsurance program approved???
Keep fighting Amy!
We need to know you will cosponsor Bernie's Single Payer so we are ready when we take back congress
you go girl!
Really like my two Senators. Klobuchar and Franken. Almost work cold winters. Lol
Worth.
Thank you, Amy!
Thanks for fighting for workers
Thank you Senator.
Thank you, Senator. Please keep fighting! @SenFranken @RepJasonLewis
Keep fighting, Amy, and thank you!
As  my Senator, I demand you fight for Universal Single Payer now!
Thanks, Amy! As a Minnesotan I am counting on you!
Thank you
Please pursue a government option for healthcare.  Let us buy into Medicare by choice!  Private insurance is welcome to compete.
Know you represent your state but please don't vote 4 a bill that'll harm people in other states because Trump makes deal 4 your state.
There is no reason not to have a bill that is good for all & not just red states.People should b taken care of no matter what their politics
How many times do we have to say "NO" to these Republican shills?
U should be covered under your parents. I have ap and h till there 26.
Maybe they should get a job!!
Please Senator Klobuchar: the Cassidy- Graham bill is dangerous to all Americans! DEFEAT IT!
Amen!
@lisamurkowski @SenSusanCollins @SenJohnMcCain Please stay with your no vote for the good of ALL Americans! Thank you. #ProtectOurCare
It is sad that's a battle you even need to fight; but I am thankful you are there fighting it!

#Indivisible #THERESISTANCE #resist
Keep up the fight, a Minnesota voter
If it wasn't so cold and I wasn't so old I would move to MN in a heart beat! #1 on happiest place to live. Oklahoma #50 sad place.  u
Thank you Amy. Standing with you! Strong  and still #TheResistance #GodBlessAmerica
I really appreciate all that you do. I fear losing my desperately needed coverage daily.
I'm tired of paying for others healthcare. Rely on...that's the problem.
That's how insurance works. So it should be every man for himself in the the health care market?
Speak loud and long to your Republican counterparts. We're counting on you.
