@SenatorHeitkamp @SenJohnHoeven @RepKevinCramer Wish ND Members put Nation b4 supporting Republican Fascism.
Watergate took two years. We need to do better than that. The risk of delay is existential.
.@amyklobuchar continues to act as if @HillaryClinton won MN 80%to 20%. That's unwise. @StarTribune
The rigged presidential election was that of the Democrat primary stolen by HRC & DNC.  Democrat rank & file did not want HRC
@SenFranken keep the pressure on. Thanks for your hard work.
the Clinton Crime Family lost get back to the peoples work .
yes! Keep going even though the GOP is going to try to bury it and all who try to investigate
We MUST see Trump's tax returns! Do EVERYTHING you can to get them released.

PLEASE. We can't be distracted from this issue, thank you for keeping the pressure on.
don't waiver on this

@amyklobuchar @StarTribune
please continue to fight for this and thank you
I think it's time for you to find another job and invade some one or else's privacy.
Totally support you Senator!  The "Fanagalo" by this POTUS is unacceptable and I mean Russia, taxes & emoluments!
Trump and company want to do oil and gas business with Putin, so do his corp friends, need less sanctions.
And FAST.  They are trying to do as much damage as possible within the shortest amount of time possible.
#trumpskkkabinet #investigation #Kremlinscongressman #Russiangate
how about hillary the deleted emails,the 6 billion she stole and the 400 million sent to syria! Wtfu amy!
It's finding the "bottom" of this administration that remains the real challenge . . . it just keeps getting lower.
Thank you for your efforts! Americans deserve answers on this and we can't let this issue be swept under the rug.
@RepErikPaulsen - please join Sen Klobuchar to form a nonpartisan commission to investigate Russian ties to WH
Yes!!  Thank you!  Independent counsel.  7 Russians mentioned in Steel dossier dead since it leaked!  PLEASE HURRY, Amy!!
Is this so? Would you mind tweeting a quick list?
If you mean: Churkin, Krivov, Erovinkin, Mikhailov, Malanin, Karlov, Polshikov--odd in total but none in dossier.
yes - please keep at it Senator!
as long as Sessions in not in charge will be productive. Could uncover DT's long standing relationship & Putin ties.
I wholeheartly agree!!!

Yes, we do. Keep on it.

Fake news. Pls stop & just work for us. We need Hlth care, lower age 4 medicare, medical marijuana 4 disabled.
@GreenUS4 @StarTribune Never going to get them answers! CIA and FBI I believe are corrupt! Money  that's all that matters us?
@GreenUS4 @StarTribune Over a year been asking that question. Yesterday I had CIA surveillance in my wifi!! I am just tweeter2
I am curious what steps are being taken by those in Congress to answer these questions? Action speak louder...
We need an Independent Prosecutor to Investigate the Russians hacking. 
Can't be AG Sessions. 

@SenSchumer
@ManMet80 @StarTribune 

Run with it, GO! Hurry! Please do SOMEthing with this!
what do you have to say about the illegal intelligence leaks?
thank you for pushing this important issue forward!
@alfranken @SenateGOP 

The only way to trust the govt is to have an independent, transparent investigation.
Where do you stand @RepTomEmmer?
Yes we do. If Trump colluded with Russia to win the election it needs to be invalidated!
first you have to find evidence ...any evidence...
What interaction with Russia. Cite your source..............didn't think so.
YES! We demand an investigation!  Please keep us posted on how you are driving this!
Keep up the pressure  - American people deserve to know if our election was stolen from us by Trump-Russia.
so when is this going to happen,never once did you ever say anything about hillary, because your dumbocrats
I sent you a link: http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-donald-trumps-private-russian-contacts/ …
Yes we do! We need a full investigation!
thank you!
keep digging!  Our democracy depends on it!
Ms. Klobuchar, please take a look at this piece written for @GQMagazine by @broazay:
Stop Red Baiting! Or release NSA intercepted communications to the public.

 http://observer.com/2016/04/panama-papers-reveal-clintons-kremlin-connection/ …
how about working to make our country great again enough on russia
Can the Senate fight a state from a discriminating act or law?
I thought you were done with the Russians! SMH
Yes we do!
Yes!  Please keep pushing for investigation! @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr #doyourjob
you make us all proud you are our senator and Care about our country
Please, Senator, keep this on the front burner. This cannot stand.
Thank you, Amy
......just like U were in such a hurry and supported getting to bottom of Hillary Clinton email issues??? NOT
This cannot be brushed under the rug.
You need to completely cease trying to work with Trump in any way. It only serves to legitimize him.
And the FBI. Let's not make the same mistake as in '08 and not investigate the republicans.
@RachelSB @StarTribune Quit talking and start doing! Why Trump is in there!
Thank you for your leadership on this! @amyklobuchar
girl you are amazing! I know you and @alfranken have been working hard for us. THANK YOU!! 
this will backfire on you come election time.
@rizfan Republican congress, I doubt we'll ever get a fair shake.
PRESSURE #Resist make USA #trumpfreezone
I'm with ya
yes, we do need to understand the level of involvement and/or illegal activity with Russia.
let's not forget about epipen reform please.  #bigpharma #peopleoverprofit
We demand a full independent investigation of Trump's Russian ties. Keep up the good work!
@washingtonpost does anybody in the @GOP agree?
YES - Sen Klobuchar showing the kind of transparency and leadership we need
@RepJasonLewis Sir, please join Sen Klobuchar to form an independent, nonpartisan commission to investigate Russian ties to WH
This is a time when we need a good and thorough investigation.
@sfhater @StarTribune   But she isn't mccain so who will run with this story?
Maybe we could get her a strap-on and a white wig.
Agree!  Please stay with this.
keep digging.
and your lack of Molotov throwing where the current administration is concerned @amyklobuchar, we still need to get to the bottom of that
Don't you people have more important issues to handle?
Please keep focusing on this! We demand answers.
.@amyklobuchar keep pressing this and @RepAnnaEshoo / @RonWyden legislation requiring release of @POTUS tax returns. Thanks Amy!
Indeed, it has been too quiet about #russiagate What is in the works?
-About the same time after all the IRS-Targeting....Senator Klobuchar. This may be one that cannot blame Russia.
Yes we do, senator. And we need you to be strong and vocal.
thanks for your unfailing commitment, Russia plays a very dangerous game and tries to interfere in many democratic processes
but how, when the investigative bodies of Congress wont investigate...
Trump & Co. handed this issue to the Democrats. Our govt is FULL of Russia-connected people. Let's find out why.
this man has all of the proof Amy to prove treason and election fraud.
They were trying to find out what Obama meant about being "more flexible", and get back uranium Hillary gave em.
YES! America DOES need this. Thank you
there is no illegal interaction. STOP chasing something that doesn't exist.
All will be out and @SenateMajLdr and Sessions will still be covering up. See @Khanoisseur @LouiseMensch @20committee @funder
Did we do the same with @HillaryClinton or is just a partisan thing?
follow this man. He's later out all the evidence on potus, kushner. He's a genius saving our democracy!  >>
Thank you for your leadership on this! #investigate #accountability #transparency
The funny thing is, there are a decent handful of folks here and people like @maddow who already have almost the whole story.
Oh, PLEASE!  Let the Republicans squirm in their opposition to this, to their detriment... They will pay for their willful IG!
@alfranken We demand a full independent investigation of Trump's Russian ties. Keep up the good work!
@All100Senators @StarTribune YES!! #DoYourJob @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner
Yes as an American #TrumpRussia is THE priority now #InvestigateTrump #IndependentInvestigation
So what are you waiting for? We count on Senators to take care of this stuff on their own.
Standing with you, Senator!!!
