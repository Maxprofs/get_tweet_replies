no proof Russia tampered with votes nor that Trump colluded w/them. How about investigating ur own party's dirty politics?
Krysta, on what basis do you make your findings, when there is still an open FBI investigation? @amyklobuchar
other heads of government agencies testified on the Hill that there was no proof of voter tampering by Russia.
The uneducated will follow that PHONY @realDonaldTrump right down the drain.
oh I'm educated. I don't feed from the media feed trough of lies unlike some.
Please come out and say you will support a filibuster against Gorsuch.
@TimesNow_tweets @LouiseMensch writes why nunes needs to be arrested & is a threat 2 national security https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/ …
Excellent thanks for posting @HiMaui and for writing @LouiseMensch
Pls read full @LouiseMensch article as it explains why Nunes shd/B arrestd, whch I agree's needed.
he told the truth, sorry it goes against your theory, get to work on real issues, or we will vote you out?
Presidents who are currently under FBI investigation should not be allowed to appoint Supreme Court Justices. Filibuster!
yes please & thank you!
We know we need it. Who has the authority to DO it? We all keep talking about it but HOW does it happen? What is the process?
and hopefully the truth will set us free of @POTUS et al
aren't you and truth sworn enemies?
@24CaliGal if you aren't willing to call for both you're just another party hack
One will lead to answers of both, but of course. This tweet was simply about our democracy at risk by s foreign body-
no it won't. Mines said the docs he saw abt surveillance & unmasking had nothing to do with Russia
Nunez is a hack changing his story several times, went out in the cover of night, briefed the WH before the committee
bad judgment but doesn't change the facts. Otoh Russia collusion has no facts so its all politics
YOU DONT KNOW THAT UNTIL THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION.
I agree but we KNOW there was unmasking & leaking of classified info we don't know there was collusion w/Russia
INDEPENDENT SELECT COMMISSION 
So true.  Yet we are suffering this guy Nunes and his strange, politically motivated behavior.
It's Russia's fault not my terrible Superdelegate vote for deeply flawed candidate.

@NashvilleResist @StarTribune yes not party verses party  our nation as a whole demands the truth
@flightpathbook @StarTribune Nunes has shown he hasn't  sworn Allegiance to our Constitution..he swore it to Donald
@24CaliGal yes and also an independent one on surveillance of transition team + unmasking & leaking of americans' identities
dealing w/ the bigger more substantial of all that is before us 1st is the Russia problem, will lend to other answers
the bigger one is where there is actual evidence of a crime. Someone leaked classified info to WaPo & someone unmasked
@amyklobuchar @StarTribune
Then let's keep the Gorsuch vote free of "politics" too.  He's an awesome judge.  Keeps his personal wishes out of decisions.
quick and in a hurry please...it will be bad for #America when all this #russiagate explodes but time to bring it
In light of all this .@amyklobuchar WHY are you allowing Gorsuch's appointment to go forward?
You don't appoint commissions to investigate sh*t that you Dems just make up .@amyklobuchar. Did you never take civics? .@StarTribune
Which election ? 2012 general or 2016 Arizona primary.
Thank you Senator Klobuchar! Let's get 'er going and get the real story.
please insist that Nunez steps down from chair. This is intolerable.
Yes!
Kinda' tricky only speaker Ryan can do that. Good News PR is in hot water...might be a change.
A BIG meeting of many many days.
I totally agree Mrs Klobuchar!
DITTO.
PLEASE fight for this Amy! We have a right to know if this FOTUS is totally corrupt and his family should NOT be security clr!
Thank you Sen Klobuchar. Please keep insisting.
You sure you aren't an investigative reporter?
We need the truth, and we need to not confirm lifetime appts while the Pres is under investigation. Filibuster if necessary!
You're so right. This is a total travesty. :-/
also calling for independent commission on Trump surveillance?  If not, call is disingenuous.
how can we as individuals push for independent counsel nunes go to the house
I would agree.
@amyklobuchar @StarTribune
We need 2 end instit racism in public Ed & crime act, end 2 wars & weapon sales & peace. Don't need political investigations

@ChrisDuranCC   We demand the truth. No matter what the truth might be.
Keep up the pressure! Thank you.
please help us fight for the truth!  We need the independent investigation!  Proud of the MN Senators 
@PaulBegala Yes!  Nunes needs to step down and leave the investigation up to those that will put country before party.
Nunes doesn't only appear crooked & compromised, but also in completely over his head.
As I understand it, the bills for this need to pass both house and senate and go to president; he's not going to sign it...
So, what are the options besides Deputy AG if hired may call for this or special prosecutor.  how do we get this rolling?
are you still on that? Why don't you care about Hillary s insubordination. Her life style defys discription
Yes, it's about politics.
Yes we do. Thank you for pushing for this.
AGREED!
YES, please don't let it die until we get to the bottom of this!
The GOP leadership has now proven they cannot be trusted with this investigation. GOP in House is corrupt!
@lovealaska1105 could you please ask about this? Also the Russian winery thing? Nunes needs to recuse.
because the GOP controls the Senate and did then, too.
he's shifting his pants every time he sees Russian assassinations thinking he needs to serve them better
thank you for continuing to be a voice we can depend on Senator.
@KidsNotMarkets @StarTribune If it's not about politics & just about fair elections you should be outraged by the Dem primary.
@KidsNotMarkets @StarTribune Let the Truth Commission explore Dems' collusion vs. Sanders too.  Our elections need to be fair.
@PaulBegala @StarTribune 
This man seems frantic.
He appears to be actively trying to keep something hidden.
What is it?
what needs to be done to get this independent commission? Let's get it done.
Yes, a thousand times yes
Senator, yes, we do but we need Democratic Senators and Representatives to light the fight up. We got your backs.
That will be difficult without giving someone a commission #MoneyTalks
@PaulBegala  @DevinNunes must go. Not even trying to appear unbiased. Pro-DJT efforts on full display, has betrayed his oath.
he needs to go the republicans and Trump can't be trusted when they want to sell the US to the Russia
@SCClemons #LockHimUp #devinnunes @DevinNunes
Oh, but it is about politics. The further we delve into Russia the more we upset and delay the GOP agenda. It's all about politics.
@PaulBegala #Independent of Nunes!!!
@PaulBegala Putin made me vote for Trump. Thank goodness.
@PaulBegala @StarTribune @DevinNunes has Russia ties. When is @SpeakerRyan going to replace him OR RYAN has Russia ties too
What we need are messages and policy positions beyond "We oppose Trump."
Failing that, at least show some supporting evidence so we know it's not just a Bengahzi witch hunt/distraction.
@jeffsessions Needs his assistant attorney general. #SCOTUS Needs it's #gorsuch  This isn't about politics.
where was this devotion to find the truth about the Clinton campaign?
When are you going to look into @HillaryClinton selling U.S. Uranium to Russia? You have #SelectiveCuriosity   @StarTribune
how about you work on wiretapping, that's what's concerning to me
Sooner rather than later, Please. #resist #trumprussia
serious question: how can we help make this happen? Can we call our reps or do we need to wait for the FBI?
@SCClemons An Ind. Commission like 9/11 takes an act of Congress and Trump's signature. Better a bipartisan special committee
Thank you!  An independent commission regarding #trumprussia would hopefully depoliticize the process, which is compromised.
please keep pushing for it!!
Everything you leftists do is about politics and politics only as the left is a fanatical religion. Power > "public good"
Don't believe you Amy. This is completely about politics.
we need also to look at the Trump China connection and consider very strongly the Emoluments Clause
You are right Senator.  We are counting on dems like you to hold the line on Trump and his corruption. Keep on...
yes, we do.  Thanks for speaking up!
this is very important use all you influence that you and Al have to bring this to the fore front thanks
absolutely needed. Nunes needs to remove himself also, if no independent commission.
Nunes needs to go. Independent investigation is the only option at this point.
Get Nunes OFF Intel. Commitee!  His running to DT w/secret info was very wrong & suspect!!
Yes! The sooner, the better.
@tinalynnnelson Can you call for an Independent Inquiry before the FBI present their findings? Comey might fry Trump.
Sure they can. Its so needed, we can't really trust Comey, but I think he wants to divert attention from him unto DT
and the truth will set us free
@SpeakerRyan must replace @DevinNunes he is compromised
Why don't we just get it all out there then? http://ln.is/www.thenation.com/ar/4mU2V …
http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/319383-administration-discloses-bounty-of-gifts-from-foreign-leaders …
Remember it's not political
Yes we do! Nunes is either in on it or stupid or both.
As long as we pursue the surveillance charges on the Trump team before and after the election at the same time.
@AltUSPressSec NUNES SELF DISQUALIFIED WITH FISA VIOLATION SHARING FISA EVIDENCE W/TARGET, DJT. NUNES COMPROMISED, STEP DOWN
Yes. Keep fighting the good fight.
@alfranken Keep pushing. We need to know the truth so we can safeguard elections in the future, for both parties.
YES...like now b4 they feign a terrorist attack
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1544107155601352&id=191247007554047 …
strongly agree. Nunes is totally compromised and in way over his head
and how does that happen?
Not! It's always been politics. Everything You do is. #Democratlies
Yes, and please come out and say you will filibuster Gorsuch.
"This isn't about politics."  Now that's funny.
This is what America wants but GOP will block.
and?
I just found out @DevinNunes owns a winery that has Russian connections. Now this makes since...
Nunes was also on the Trump transition team.  He's in those tapes! #impeach
Persist!!
Amy then start with Obama and finish with Hillary. Now You have a scandal. You are Just being a wannabe Irelevant politician
