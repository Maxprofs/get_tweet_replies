Don't put your head in the sand Amy.
Army's head is always in the sand when it comes to Trump! She hates him!
Donny should STOP listening to Fox news.. Wakey
Stop the world, I want to get off. Lol
Majority of Americans baffled by Trump every single day-please help get us out of this nightmare!
Maybe we should be concerned with the crimes and rapes that Sweden is covering up, rape up 500%?
More alternate facts to rile up the libiots.  He was speaking of their refugee problem.  Try actually working!
U are not being honest with this...
Amy, please consider legislation to help ensure mental health in the executive branch.   GOP will hop on board soon!

Amy seriously wake up on Sweden being a Swede myself it is a major issue that is getting worse by the month
Baffled because their heads in the sand.  It's real dangerous there.
@amyklobuchar @CBSNews
Out of touch again!
japan and russia are the only ones not having a immigration problem
Again to quick to Resist POTUS. Sweden has No Go Sharia Zones the rape and violence by unvetted muslims is FACT
Please watch Steven Colbert's (if you haven't) monologue on this, super funny!
A President who makes things up about our Allies - shameful and it must stop.
this man is dangerous!
he heard it on FOX so t must be true--the real fake news!
The Sweden episode is an example of the workings of his mind.  I do wish I found it funny.
Yep!!!  #HurricaneTrump #lies to #manipulate ... #embarrassed #sick #sad

Dear Sweden I assure you that our president is not on crack our sincere apologies
how about being with America? You are ridiculous
Yeah we're baffled too
The fact that saying this is necessary is ridiculous

When Trump lies or stretches the truth he is strategicly pulling us away from the real issues.
For those that don't rely on unverified random internet videos for #factchecking There is

thanks for the levity - that is about all we have
I guess when the police chief tells woman not to go out after dark, everything is normal there.
maybe you should show him this.  Check out @TEN_GOP's Tweet: https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/833333763945984001?s=09 …
Bravo Senator 4 speaking out. ND public servants @SenatorHeitkamp @SenJohnHoeven @RepKevinCramer too SILENT on #45.
Sweden is the joke of Western Europe. If anyone hasn't looked into just how badly they messed up, they should now.
It's ironic Trump claims got info on terrorist attack from Fox News, a news station NOT labeled as Fake News. KARMA!
he's a tweeter head goof ball.
isn't Sweden now the rape capital of the world??? major Refugee problem...
Dear Sweden, 45 is delusional.  Just be grateful he isn't your prime minister.
Trump just doesn't get the Ole' and Lena jokes, I guess :)
Next week it will be a story about Norway, or New Zealand, or Name Any Country...
Look at the increase in violence, lawlessness, and murder in Sweden over the last 2 yrs. That was the crux of his mes
Poor Swedes have borne the brunt of Norwegians' jokes for years and now this? #SwedenStrong
@POTUS was referring to https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=FJDNHIfLIhM …. It's very interesting.  Watch.  Learn about what Sweden hides.
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar!

But Fox News!
