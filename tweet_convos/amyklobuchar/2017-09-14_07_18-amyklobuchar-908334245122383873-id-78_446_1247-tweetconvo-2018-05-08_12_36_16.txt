Looks like your dad taught you well/!!!!
yet you dont agree to comply with voter fraud, which is REAL!
There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud.  It's been looked at.  Audits show actual fraud rates are miniscule.
Recent NC audit showed 508 out of 4.8 million votes cast.
That's a rate of 0.000105.  Not worth talking about.  Why do you?
1 fraudulent vote is 1 too many. I have zero tolerance for it. If a Felon cannot vote, "dead" people & "illegal" immigrants dont get too!
It doesn't affect results.  Get real. Find something important to worry about besides miniscule unimportant irrelevant stuff.
0.0001 means elections aren't affected and fraud's *extremely* rare.  Basic mathematical literacy is lacking.  Maybe spend $ on that instead
Franken stole his senate seat. That is well known. why? because a box of "votes" showed up in a trunk the day after losing. can u explain?
Your truth avoidance is sad.  I'm blocking you now.  Bye.
Thank you!
Great! But we want to switch back to Paper Voting Ballots! We will never lose agin if we do, Sen Klobuchar, electronic machines are rigged!
Help us to switch over to Paper Voting Ballots, Senator Amy Klobuchar! That's the only realistic way to get our majorities back in Congress!
Americans will never have fair elections as long as the system is rigged! Paper Voting Ballots is the only way our votes will count!
U wish to lower budget for bands yet who will sound alarm 4 election intrusion? Love your work still n need of lost morals found 4 military.
Dems, interfere with elections by flooding the country with muslims, and we don't like most of them
Stop with the PC talk please, Senator. Russia did not attempt to interfere in the '16 election, they did, and they stole it. You know this.
Why is such an important issue taking too much time? The Russians attacked the US! Sorry, take your time!
Manually countable paper voting records should be mandatory as part of any election security plan.
Um, it DID interfere. That's why trump and other Republicans won.
No, they DID interfere & so far, no one has looked closely to see effect on elections, even w/MINORITY President (which should never happen)
Thank you.  It's sad that we rewarded Putins efforts by swearing in his puppet.  Hillary should be President.
Paper trail technology! Holy smokes!
You need to get bipartisan support to stop trumph care.Trumph is a traitorous enemy of the United States.
Thank you Amy for working so hard to reach across the isle on smart, needed legislation
Russia DID interfere. And they still are. Back to paper ballots. Machines are hackable.
Attempted?
Like we don't interfere with other countries.  How about pay to play Hillary liked so much . And the uranium deal with Russia .
Both debunked lies. Russia thanks you for being so ignorant. Or maybe you work for them. Who knows anymore?

I like Lindsey
Support medicare for all please!
I'm so grateful for you!
I applaud your efforts, if not the language, but when will the '16 election results be investigated? Many of us think Trump is illegitimate
What Y'all gonna do about Putin installing #trumptrash by his Thugs changing vote talliesBigger fish to fry about 2016 election FIRST
^succeeded in interfering in
ASAP!
I wouldn’t say “attempted”, “allegedly” maybe, but there’s *strong* evidence that they were successful on multiple levels.
"Attempted" is not a good term to use here but good on the amendment.
Thank you!
Evidence?  If course not.
Thank you for that. Lacking leadership on this from the White House, it's vital for Senators to step up and protect our democracy.
Thank you Senators!
As usual, again Senator @amyklobuchar with @LindseyGrahamSC are doing good jobs. Bipartisan works, for: no one was born an island. Thank U.
Take 'em down, Amy!
Thank you Amy!
Sen "Bi-Partisan" Klobuchar. Always Making deals w/ these new R's that can result in losses for we @IndivisibleMN03 the ppl.
Amy....they didn't attempt to interfere....they interfered!
That happens every election... nothing new... they fact it's the first election you are talking about it cause you lost, is the scary part!
What about single payer healthcare? Support our future!
Correct!
Obama and Gang Of 8 should have initiated this a year ago. We've lost precious time but I applaud your efforts.
Congress must act to protect our elections. Democracy depends on it.
Switch back to Paper Voting Ballots! All electronic voting machine's and scanner's software are rigged, and too expensive to fix!
Attempted?
If they did, how much effect did it make on the election?
Btw: they attempted and succeeded!!!!!  Stop soft petaling it!
Thank God someone is paying attention to this!!  The Russians should not be bragging about corrupting our elections, they are now!!!
Why do we continue to say Russia attempted, they won, in other words they succeeded; Trump won by their efforts.
Best $100k ever spent on Facebook evidently
HAHAHAHAHA you're worse than HRC . Get over it for heavens sake and figure out how Dems can win in 2020
More theater.
I take it your against VOTER ID even though everyday we read about unregistered voters voting Illegally including your Minnesota
"ATTEMPTED to intefere"...?
Sen.K
Is this lie you have to swallow to work w Rs
really worth it?
You know Rus did & a traitor's in WH
#RESIST
It's looking like they succeeded. I know nobody wants to say it but they did.
"Attempted" is Trump normalizing anti-American bullshit. They DID interfere.
Anything in this amendment regarding requirements for voter ID? That's the biggest problem with election interference.
Get rid of the electoral!
Russia didn't attempt to interfere.  Theu did interfere.  The question is how much
Lol where  is the proof stupid
Without transparency & control over FB, Google and other monopols, it's impossible not to have interference.
Evidence? I thought so
so CRITICALLY IMPORTANT to the survival of our Democracy please do all you can to protect & restore the sanctity of our electoral process
How can you propose an amendment without a full, transparent investigation & understanding of what happened?
I think we have a pretty good understanding of what happened.
Attempted?  Pretty clear they were successful at interfering.
#UraniumOne
While in the right direction, this will do little to nothing if corrupt state election boards are allowed to spend $$ carte blanche.
Thank you for trying to protect our nation!
THANK YOU LINDSEY AND AMY!
Hopefully this will come about.  I like paper validation.  Although, I think paper ballets may be better.  We can wait for accurate results.
I like you.
This is really good. One caveat. They didn't attempt to interfere.  They did interfere.
If the WH wont do it, thank you senators for prioritizing. Every day we find out more how we were hacked and infiltrated via social media.
Thank you, Senator!
Now it's just "attempted?"  So are we finally admitting they didn't?
"Attempted"?
We know they did interfere, so thank you for introducing this amendment! Much needed, much appreciated.
There is no proof  stupid. Russia  didnt  call me
They did more than attempt!
We were attacked! They are still doing it.
they didn't attempt. they DID interfere.
Thanks for using 'interfere' as it was much worse than what 'meddling' conveys.
