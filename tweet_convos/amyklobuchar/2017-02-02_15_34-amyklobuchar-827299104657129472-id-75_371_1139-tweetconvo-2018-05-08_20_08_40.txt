Sen Klobuchar, save us from the Tyrant in the WH. BOTH Bannon & Trump. Americans are genuinely afraid of what is happening! 
I'm not, quit projecting.
Self-absorbed much? Awfully arrogant to assume I was personally singling YOU out. Get over yourself. smh
Read your post again. Now read mine. Repeat. You know that feeling that you feel right now? It's ignorance, get used to it. 
You seem angry.
I'm actually laughing atm.  Not at you, yet not with you either I assume. 
Please keep close eye on @Plaid_Tillerson - he'll turn blind eye so his oil buddies can make more $$$ #Resistance
fyi, you just linked a parody account.  Epic troll. I lold.
I know. Don't have acct for the actual SecOil.
gotcha 
Speak with your votes. Your rhetoric is pointless when you'll vote to confirm cabinet picks with alleged ties to the Kremlin.
The Kremlin... lolololol 
try and tell that to Donny T and his boys so deep in with putin they want to lift sanctions and establish a new order
u wot?
glad this story is getting notice.  this is important, since djt has all but pledged his allegiance to Putin.
you're pretty easily manipulated.  Cool.
did Trump really just ease sanctions against Russia????
No, he didn't.
Senator with all due respect you should be more concerned with the citizens of America and the intolerance of your party.
Al Franken is doing a much better job in taken care of Minnesota.
Recent here @amyklobuchar @MMFlint @johncusack :
Thank you. It is important!
Amy, I apologize for earlier mean tweets, which I deleted. My lovely MN wife said "be nice". Thanks for taking this position.
Amy, I'm tired of the Democratic rhetoric. You and ur colleagues need to do something like help Dem Govs get elected.
don't cave into Republicans... Make them take a stand for Ukraine and for the majority of Americans
Is the Russian investigation into the election hacking still alive? Is there going to be closure with that?
Put a plan in place to win back the Senate I'm a Frustrated Dem who wants to see the party fight the GOP and win Talk is cheap
Putin dismantled @HillaryClinton after she publish '13 US military backing Ukraine upon her election. @amyklobuchar @MMFlint @johncusack
I do not recognise the US, the change has been so dark and so fast, used to really look up to the US but now, I don't know.sad
while we still have any
Thank you.  As as constituent who voted for you, I support your position on calling for investigation and sanctions.
Typical Putin justified aggression against humanity in general! Why is capturing Ukraine  so important to Putinites? Energy

Can we just try some diplomatic courses & not be the aggressive bully. Get Petraus or other negotiator. Sick of WAR.
Agreed.
#komrpomat
I don't how any US-American can assess what is going on in Europe. Well, I much more prefer what Al Franken is saying about it
Thank you. You are my Senator, please stand strong.
You are either clueless, criminally mind altered or black mailed.
Trump needs to be impeached, just made another childish twitter threat thinking it's the place for diplomacy.
I think it's an offensive by the Ukrainian side against separatists.
True, but Iran, ISIS N. Korea must be handled first. Can find mutual interest w/ Russia. At least they don't chant Death to US
We understand that...but Trump is about to roll back all wall street regs put in place since 2008. We are going to die..Again
@SenJohnMcCain 2 weeks in&we are close to war with Iran & China, we are mostly ignoring Russia &offending allies. Not Good.
Thank you!
Without charging our Allies!
my dad is Ukrainian.  He was a refugee 65 years ago. Thank you for your brave support. I want to help.
We demand you investigate Trump and his cabinet's ties to Russia (Mike Flynn). Sanctions should not be eased! Suspicious.
And what about what Putin did to Vladimir Kara-Mirza and Boris Nemtsov.  Assassinations/attempts of people who oppose him.
like you support his cabinet picks#justsayno
please say something about Russia celebrating the easing of FSB sanctions hours before Congress was notified.
who cares. They obviously discussed it on the call. Plenty of important things for you to worry about still.
Getting tired of your empty words, senator. Failing us. I am witnessing your ineptitude to stand to POTUS. So is my vote
They asked Putin.  He said no.  Sorry, looks like you'll need to impeach.
Shelling starts after Trump and Putin chat with WH recording equip turned off.  DJT silent on issue.  Wonder what was said...
40% in new poll support impeachment. Be bold. Obstruct, resist, attack.
if Russia has any influence over POTUS or GOP I need to know right away please.
The answer depends on how gullible you are. I'm going to be optimistic and say, no.
glad you are in DC to do what's right #staystrong
The Dude would agree...this aggression will not stand
@melissacolorado you see the new nuclear missile Russia has that can wipe out a whole country a can't be detected?

May I ask what type mining is there? Sorry from PNW & not sure what's mined where
Thank you.
#klobucharForPresident2020
.@amyklobuchar Thank you Senator for protecting our alliances & the international obligations that keep us safe!
What alliance are you referring to?
Do we still have allies?
like Israel?
agree. I also appreciate that u standing against oppression from our president against Muslim American citizen like me.
And the Democrats need to support their President instead of behaving like children!
Iran ballistic missile tests cannot stand! Ayatollahs must be eliminated.
You and Senator Kamala Harris speak for those of us with Repub Senators who will not answer their phones. Thank you!
Thank you for this Amy.
@realdontrump seems to be yelling at all of them
We don't even know who our allies are anymore.
Correct! Hard core Dems have no clue who their allies are. If there were leadership of Dems, you would know. Ciao Uno
And not go out of our way to annoy other allies. SMH I'm so frightened and embarrassed.
lol
you sign up to go over and fight. How many wars can a volunteer fight?
How now with T Rex and lifting of sanctions?? We need a LEADER to get Country back!
