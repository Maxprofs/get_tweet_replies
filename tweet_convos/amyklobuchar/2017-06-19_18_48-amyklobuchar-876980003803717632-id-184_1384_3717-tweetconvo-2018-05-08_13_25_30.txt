Thank you Amy.
You smirked at Chris Wallace re civil discourse, guess you smirked when Bernie said "any means necessary to stop GOP health plan" PHONY/SICK
Grateful to you & @alfranken, you make this MN'n proud. Few things are more vital than the #health of ALL . Especially those in need.
Make me puke
With sadness , I think Americans know why it is being drafted in secret. To hide what is being done. Someone thinks they know what's good4us
When Congress makes legislation without full representation of the American people Congress failed to do right to ALL CONSTITUENTS/Americans
Thank you! With love from Minnesota. #HoldTheFloor
@lisamurkowski Are you really okay with this?
Now that it's out, as a constituent I want to know what will you be doing to stop it from passing in the Senate? #ProtectOurCare
#Resistyourass Voting your ass out of Minnesota!!!! Drain the swamp
I'm with you @amyklobuchar. I saw you at @womenwinning in MN. I'm not just RESISTING, I'm INSISTING on a better way! #ACA #SHowUsTheBill
Thank you! I can't count on my Rep from MN02 to represent me. Glad I can count on you and @alfranken!
Fight!
Help be our voice! Stand your ground! and THANK YOU #stage4 #showusthebill #healthcare #savemylife @ACSCANMN
The only thing that will fix this is VOTING by Americans
Keep fighting Amy!
Please stop healthcare bill. It only insures that Doctors get paid. Insure my retail business. I need more help than rich Doctors & drugies.
Ur not in power, stand down #electionsmatter
Thank you for working to protect the Affordable Care Act. You have my support.
Thank you. As someone who is a 6 yr breast cancer survivor at 49 I will likely need some care - 16 yrs before Medicare. I pay $1800 Mo now!
As someone who is coming up to a year as a survivor I am very concerned about what is next.
....don't forget No Respect for the American People or our voices because after all it is about Us.
Amy, Please just start talking about a fix and repair plan on ACA. Just say the words that assures the public. It wouldn't hurt. It assures
Please stop the GOP Amy. No more MN nice.  Thank you for all you do
A bit of history https://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacares-secret-history-1497482858 â€¦

Wherein Gruber mocks the American people for being "stupid."
Forgot the public hearings @SenatorBenson . As has your party's Senate delegation. & the 5 day window for the ACA is luxurious comparatively
GOP's leader can't even commit to >10 hours to review AHCA. & you want to compare that to the ACA? #ShowUsTheBill
I'll compare this to ACA it is failing. Because dems were too stupid to get it right. So they r too stupid to be involved in fixing it.
Saw you in the Senate floor, good job fighting for healthcare
Waiting for you to #ShowUsYourZumbroHouseInvestigation for selling illegal pot getting mentally ill sent to prison @ZumbroHouseInc @conken1
Keep up the fight. We appreciate your efforts!
Thanks for fighting Amy!
you all passed obumers bill & pelosi the brain child said you had to pass it to see what is in it,  childish reply, then again she is a dem
Thank you."Political Outsider"has been twisted to imply "honest,instinctual"+doesn't.We need people like you-expert w/record to stand by.
The house bill was horrible, this must be worse so I believe they are  recommending shooting elderly and kids and giving their things to 1%
Thank you, Senator. BTW, great to see you on Maddow!
Maddow lmao  now there is some real fake news
Thank you, Amy. We're proud to know that you represent us well.
You go girl!
how is any of this even legal much less constitutional?
Thank you for standing up for all of us! #DemocratsRock
@SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley  please ask questions and see the changes being made behind closed doors!!
From Iowa, I say thank you!! #ShowUsTheBill !!!! Our kiddos with special needs have a right to live independently!!! #SaveMedicaid
Maybe if U Actually Demanded 2C what Obama was doing behind closed doors...U wouldn't be Left in the Dark.. 
w/No Control of the situation,.
Which puts the American ppl in a Vulnerable position.. ONE of YOUR Responsibilities was to PROTECT THE PEOPLE, Which YOU FAILED TO do..
Thanks, Senator, but I believe the GOP would follow this insane pres. Into nuclear war! They seem blind to facts and fairness.
Thank you for speaking for the American people #HoldTheFloor
Thank you for your speech.  The GOP will learn the hard way.  This is a horrible bill, and will hurt millions of Americans.
Thank you. Awesome work!
This sounds very familiar. Do you think you'll have to vote "for it" to see what's in it? These two parties are sooo similar.
Thank you for doing this
Thank you @amyklobuchar and @SenFranken and other Dem senators for fighting for us! I'm 56, cancer survivor, self-employed. Very concerned.
What is happening to my/our country?
This is how fascists behave-make no mistake-GOPolitcal insurgents-as a former republican 4 45 yrs Im disgusted-@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
loyalty and trustworthy to the masses
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you for fighting for us.
It is all about their donors and not about the needs of constituents. It is a crime against humanity.
Thank you Senator for working so hard for us!
kind of sounds like what the Dems did to pass the ACA.  Not right.  Time to quit the games.
Thank you! So proud to have you as my senator! :)
Thank you for your efforts. No hearing-NO BILL
what was your position during obamacare ? ... Dem use of Reconciliation Rule? with only Dem support. zero Rep's. shameful.
Keeping fighting for us! Thank you.
Did you read the last one before you voted for it?  Just asking.
Enough with the political witch hunt and wasting time and money. Do the peoples business. Work with Potus or wait till we get to vote.
This side show has no affect. What are @SenateDems doing that is useful? Shut down senate-they r violations by OUR rights to representation
What can they do when the GOP is working behind closed. This is not democracy!
After listen to y"all tonight, I had to do something!
Are you compromising on anything? Or, were you behind your original "aye" vote on the PPACA? It's about to implode Sen. or aren't u looking?
Thank you!
We are dealing with fascism and marginalization of the vulnerable. Yet they squawk about being victims.
Vote-a-Rama, please. This bill needs to die the long agonizing death the GOP is trying to impose on the most vulnerable among us
Thank you and please keep the pressure on #ShowUsTheBill
Hope you're ready to lose your seat in the Senate.
You mean just like how you passed #Obamacare?
100 open session meetings + 150 R amendments + 2 years == ACA. 

Do you see the difference?
#HoldTheFloor
Keep fighting for us!  Thank you!
Thanks for your advocacy, Sen Klobuchar!!
Thank you, Senator.
What McConnell is doing is undemocratic and unAmerican, but very Trump-like.

Keep fighting for MN and the country Senator!
When are you all going to stop being petulant children and start acting on behalf of American people?  U act like this never been done b4
Hoping my senators @JeffFlake and @SenJohnMcCain have that courage also! #ShowUsTheBill #NoHearingsNoVote #HandsOffMedicare #VoteNoAHCA
Thank you, Amy, for continuing to fight for needed openness and for representing us Minnesotans and Americans so well!
Thank u from a constituent. This is nuts. 1/6 of economy and life and death for millions. Fight on!
Thank you, @amyklobuchar
Warrior Amy!  Thank you for fighting for us! 
Thank you Senator #Holdthefloor
"Secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of." - Bill Moyers
Thank you!
Thanks for doing all you can.
Thank you Senator Klobuchar! Keep up the great work!
Thank you so much. I'm disabled, severely, and hope you'll continue to help us fight for healthcare for all.
This is what you originally did to U.S. health care system with your pals @NancyPelosi and @BarackObama. Now it has to be rolled back.
Thank you @amyklobuchar from all of the women who could lose maternity coverage and access to reproductive health care.
Thank you Senator Klobuchar from MN03 soon to be formerly represented by @RepErikPaulsen #Holdthefloor
Sounds like Obamacare! We need to pass the bill so we know what's in it. Nancy walking with the big gavel
Thank you.
TY
Please continue to help #HoldTheFloor #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you!  Don't stop....we have your back!
Keep the pressure on!
Hang tough Senator. Thanks.
We appreciate you fighting for us @amyklobuchar! Means so much to those of us who are battling serious illnesses and are too sick to do it!
"No" to Republican-I-Don't-Care!
#Holdthefloor - Thank you Senator Klobuchar!
What's the point when all you are going to do is obstruct. Rep could offer eternal life in the new bill and the Dems would still find fault
To be honest, you knew you passed a terrible Obamacare bill. Mayo told you it was bad. Now look at the mess we have.
#HoldTheFloor Senator!
Thank you!
Thank you #HoldTheFloor
Thank you.
Get three GOP colleagues to flip their vote, otherwise we are in for a catastrophe!
You have to pass it to see what's in it~Democratic play book!!
Thank you Sen. Klobuchar!!!! #HoldTheFloor
Thank you Senator! Please don't give up this fight.
Thankful for you as my senator
I wonder how they would feel if they were told they were loosing their healthcare. Have they thought about that?
Thank you for fighting for our rights.
Thank you Senator!!
#IaDemsAdoptMnSens
@amyklobuchar, you're a superlative Senator and a true American patriot! #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you for your service!
please, please continue your hard work regarding healthcare
Thank you!
Thank you for doing this. I am sincerely proud and appreciative of having such a capable representative doing the right thing. Keep it up.

#ShowUsTheBill
Go get 'em, Senator! So sorry you couldn't come to our 25th anniversary, but our push to #HoldTheFloor is infinitely more important!
Thank you!
#HoldTheFloor.  Thank you @amyklobuchar!
Thank you!
Thank you for fighting the good fight!
Very proud and thankful for your work.
#HoldTheFloor
@SenFranken We need you to get LOUD! This is insane! Minnesota Nice does not apply to this issue! FIGHT! Find ur GOP friends.
Commit to shut down the senate with endless amendments under reconciliation rules.
Take it to 'em, Senator!
Isn't there some way to censor MC for his obstruction? So unAmerican
Thank you!
WTF?! It's chump-ass bullshit
So that means the Dems are done with bipartisanship.I sure hope so.
Either you commit to offering 100s of amendments during vote-a-rama or all this talking will make no difference. Time to act. #HoldTheFloor
Thank you!  #NeverthelessShePersisted
Thank you!! I'm so glad your my senator!!#HoldTheFloor
Keep up the good fight Senator Klobuchar!  We support you all the way.
Seriously, I am confused...How is this able to happen?? Please keep fighting. #ShowUsTheBIll
#ShowUsTheBill #HoldTheFloor
Thank you from all those with preexisting conditions. #ShowUsTheBill #SaveACA
Thank you for your hard work
Thank you, senator! #HoldTheFloor
Pls fight for our health care
Thank you for standing up for all Americans, as one of your MN supporters.
Thank you for fighting for us! #ShowUsTheBill #SaveACA
They must be stopped. Their contempt for the citizens of this country is derelict. They are perverting Democracy.
Nice job, Senator. TENNESSEE appreciates you!
thank you - I support blocking all business until the GOP cooperates.
Thank You Senator. You are very much appreciated.
Counting on you @amyklobuchar
Thank you, Senator! I appreciate it! 
Bravo Amy!!!
Thank you Senator! #Minnesota knows you're here for us.
Thank you. Minnesota stands behind you.
Thank you!
we need democracy
More dramatic nonsense..... Don't you remember "You have to pass the bill to see what's in it" or "You can keep your doctor"
Of course not. They only want bipartisanship when they are in the minority.
Thank you!!!
Thank you Amy! Great job tonight. #resist  #indivisible
What amendments did you propose?
Thanks Senator. The way the Republicans are proceeding is disgusting & undemocratic. I've called my Senator (Gardner) multiple times.
Thank You senator! #HOLDTHEFLOOR
#HoldTheFloor !!!
