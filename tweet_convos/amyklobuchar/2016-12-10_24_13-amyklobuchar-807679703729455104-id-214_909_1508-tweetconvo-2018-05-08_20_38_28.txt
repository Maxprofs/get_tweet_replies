what evidence are is that conclusion based on?
I hope you and all Dems aren't going to "play nice" for 4 yrs-we need toughness and hard work to hold all GOP accountable
Amy can't help it. She's a native MN, therefore "Minnesota Nice." And she STILL gets things done!
I'm MN native (living 2 yrs sabbatical in AZ) and I'm done playing nice- our country needs minority party to step up!
Are you not at all concerned that the CONTENT of the leaks showed the DNC acting unethically?
.@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost Call on the #ElectoralCollege  to #DenyTrump and elect Hillary
@Lisabrabli @washingtonpost 
Please do what you can to protect CIA field agents from retaliation by @realDonaldTrump
This is an emergency 4  House & Senate 2 come back & take care of.  Russian's don't need weapons/war they placed #Trump on us!
We Veterans are angry that Russian has successfully put a president of their choice in office. Congress should taken action when notified.
Thank-you now kick the rest of your colleagues in the ass and get them to stand up Democrats are MADDER than MAD
As one of your constituents, I concur.
Ivestigation must not cost excessive amount. Moneys needed for more important issues in this country.
Thank you!  I'll be interested to watch the outcome.  What would happen if it is proven that Trump was involved?
.@amyklobuchar @BlueNRedState   Finally, a democrat speaking out.  We ordinary citizens have been out here fighting on our own.
fake news
glad to see some reality is sinking in for our Congress. see options for treason too (before Dec. 19th). Thanks.
@toshea66 @washingtonpost 18 U.S. Code § 2381 - Treason
@SoulFlyTry @washingtonpost Way to go Amy.
Inspiring! She really is looking out for #WeThePeople
Thank you Amy Klobuchar
@clundoff @washingtonpost thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator. We hope you will take the fight on this issue, which threatens American sovereignty.
thank you, senator. Please go one step further: call for delay in @ElectoralCollge vote pending outcome.
THANK YOU!
@VileEpiphany That's what millions of us have been squawking about since the first inkling of ANY POSSIBLE Russian INFLUENCE!!
@jonathanjewel  - Get Tough! Dammit! WORK!
Thank you, Senator.
@KTynot @washingtonpost Investigation? Whatecer gappened to retaliation?
Please encourage the Democratic leadership to strongly address this outrage. This is shocking!
at this point they are not trying anymore they've done it in cohort with our own FBI leadership @CAFalk
Democracy integrity insists on it! #Democracy #Integrity #Election2016 #TrumpNotMyPresident
@jonathanjewel  - Do Something NOW!!  Save our Republic!!!  No recess, no time-off, no weekend!! Do it NOW!!!!!
@Victoria41768 @washingtonpost   Do it now Senator!
no proof. yet this lady.. talks like all has been proven. and she has no idea about cyber security.. all BS to get more money for themselves
Sorry - but too much Politician speak lately - calling for congressional investigation - into 2016 Election??
can we get a unified statement from the entire MN Congressional delegation?
Thank you!  This whole thing is alarming and scary.  We need our Reps. to stand up for the American people.
Should investigate you as a liar,criminal Clintons ties with Russia,Ukraine and Muslims, lies and corruption. And special investigations in organized crimes by DemocRATS,CNN, MSNBC against President Trump, policemen and citizens
Yes please! Don't let them get away with just investigating the hacking. There were ppl with direct links.
@CAFalk  .And George Soros. Do we care about that? or Saudi Arabia?
Trump on Russian hacking: 'I don't believe it' @CNNPolitics http://ln.is/www.cnn.com/2016/12/Bvq4P …
the Washington Post is a rag that wipes the arse of the highest bidder
.@amyklobuchar @VoteHillary2016   Congress is hamstringed by Putin holding back RNC emails. Help them to be America first.
make sure it is completed before 19 December.
apparently they are still messing with the election
Putin is cheating always
@Smith83K @washingtonpost ok but what will your Repub colleagues do? Are they willing to have this be a puppet gov for Putin?
Please do it quickly! He an NOT be allowed to lead this country!
@freeandclear1 @washingtonpost thank you, Amy!!!
name a Post Office It's WAR:USA HAS long-standing policy to collect reliable intelligence on President #Putin & losest friends
AND a halt to the college electorate voting until there is conclusive evidence otherwise?
Finally a sane elected official.
Respectfully,this info available from Sept, info should have supplied to voters/ Should have Leak it. if necessary.  @Mattison
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you for talking about this. Too many have been silent! Hope we can keep up the pressure.
aren't McConnell's actions treason? He let this go on and silenced it knowing what he knew!
We need many more to stand with you including those across the aisle.
thank you!
Thank you from this constituent
Follow the Constitution 
Follow the Law
@metaquest All this farting around while we all know election was rigged! Will it eventually change the outcome? Doubt it!
Thank you Senator; the next step is to investigate NOW to assist electors in preserving our democracy on 12/19
@gregpmiller thank you!
Thank you. We need to understand the extent of this. Foreign tampering in our elections is unjust, should not be tolerated.
Electoral College vote must be put on hold. We must be certain that  #Trump did not collude with #RNC and #Russia to steal election.
have you lost your mind?
so what, Americans voted, are you as concerned about lobbyists? You should be
Thank you from Illinois !!
Thank you so much, Senator! Please keep fighting for us!
Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar! Proud you're my Senator!
I think this is a distraction. Please spend your time fixing healthcare
Do more. ACT. Ask the Electoral College to support the popular vote! It's a matter of National Security.
@vickscan @washingtonpost please do! This is a interference to our future!
Spend your time working on something worthwhile Amy.
thank you. If they won't run one, the Democrats need to run one on their own. Push Obama to declassify the reports.
@Suburb_Flamingo @washingtonpost thankyou Senator
@Karoli @washingtonpost I saw this happening the minute @PaulManafort was added to team..have research no one wanted. Shame
. Totally right
 I saw it too. #ComradeTrump #RussiaHacking
Thank you for calling for an investigation, from Crystal, MN
@Karoli @washingtonpost thank you so, so much, Amy!
Please make it fast!
Just words unless you have the courage to fully disclose the trail & charge #Trump with treason. DO SOMETHING!
@Karoli @washingtonpost colaboration to hush what they knew would aid our national enemy while lining their pockets #TREASON
Key word here is "Secret". There is ZERO actual evidence Putin or Russian intel rigged the election. Conspiracies undermine us
@Karoli @washingtonpost please make that investigation before the inauguration.  #dfl
Thank you but the coup already happened unless we stop the @ElectoralCollge from making a catastrophic #ElectoralMistake
We know for sure is that Mitch McConnell knew and the GOP new in the hid it from us.Trump was in on it too
Russia all so hacked RNC. Are they holding those documents as blackmail over the RNC?
Amy one word describes my distaste with ur tweet- DOPE! @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @mike_pence
@claudiamiles  Not liberal or conservative, committers of injustice can't be rewarded 4 doing so. The People chose HRC 4 Pres.
Will Republicans in Congress also call for Congressional investigation.
@msholmes2U @washingtonpost I say you start tomorrow before corrupt Russian agent DT is installed with cabal of his.
put up a decent candidate and maybe you win, just more  rhetoric, Hillary lost because she had no agenda!
YES!
.@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost And now we're reading of a meeting w/ McConnell and Comey present where they refused a bipartisan statement?
Thank you, Senator!
YES! @amyklobuchar 

@washingtonpost
Thank you very much.  We need this.
@slee4629 @washingtonpost that's great senator. But what are you willing to sacrifice for the investigation?
@realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow @GOP I say RECOUNT - everything is wrong in this 2016 elections. Good job, Senator.
Thank you Amy.  Please do not fail American democracy.
Run for re-election please Senator, country cannot afford to lose your voice on Senate at this time.
@PhoenixWomanMN Thank you, Senator! We need you to fight for us.
Is that same CIA that cooked intelligence reports re Iraq WMDs? Same CIA that has conducted coups d'etat throughout the world?
Has anyone been influenced by DNC leaked emails? For most of us it just confirmed what we already knew. Hilbots rejected them.
We need more than an investigation - much more.
senator we need to call for new election to much interference from Russia and McConnell
@TheRealYoG @washingtonpost The incriminating info against HRC came from the U.S. security apparatus, not Russia.
trump Hillary are friendshttps://twitter.com/TheRealYoG/status/807677650303008768
Thank you Senator. This threatens US sovereignty & should be every Americans most important issue-Represent us
@TheRealYoG @washingtonpost Absurd. The truth about Clinton's duplicity benefited Americans regardless of the source.
I agree with it wholly. Let's blame Trump for Clinton having an unsecured server.
Should also delay electoral college vote
TY for your voice on this. Let's hope that the call is loud from both sides of the aisle - this is an issue that concerns all!
investigation will take too long. Take to the streets! Urge EC to vote hillary.
Great, Senator. But NOW. Give this breach of our democracy the urgency & seriousness it deserves & requires. NOW.
O M Freaking G!
thank you Senator @amyklobuchar
@Ainokea88 Not just "trying"...
Thank you Senator. This is very disturbing.
Thank you and finally @amyklobuchar Tell @alfranken he needs to be a LOUDER voice repudiating every aspect. Russia,@FBI,Cross-Check,Etc,Etc.
Really. Hope you've got that on HYPER FAST FORWARD, because we have 7 days left til PUTIN PUPPET IS ELECTED.

Thank you. It's vital we learn the truth & take action. Our election was stolen.
@astorkinhand @washingtonpost @PeoplesVuePoint Correction; PUTIN DID HELP TRUMP WIN!
Yet we'll see. 12/19/16 #ElectoralCollege
Thank you, Amy!!
it was the "what" that was exposed that cost HRC; not the "who" that exposed it. Don't get it confused.
But Congress is recessing.....again.
I hope you will not let up on this. Our country is on the verge of an oligarch takeover.
And McConnell was rewarded handsomely. His wife was given a Cabinet post.
Was trying? I would say they DID rig the election.
seriously how can we help
You all need to make all the Intel available to the Electors Now & American Ppl! Can't wait for investigation
Keep doing your job!  we support you!
@MaggieJordanACN @washingtonpost about time. Let's please investigate what is going on here
We all have to pick our battles but this is a hill worth fighting for.  Thank you @NancyPelosi @LindseyGrahamSC @SenSchumer...
I support all your efforts and am so glad you are my senator!
@Glodine @washingtonpost 

Every Senator and Representative should calling for this!!
Immediately.
Take page out of Stein Playbk~>Get Off Your Asses & Fight While We're Still A Democracy! Soon Dems Will be a Mere Distraction.
.@amyklobuchar Thank you, Senator. This grave matter calls for immediate action.
@BixKaren Why Not Wait Til AFTER Coup Is Over? Your "Investigation" Will Consist Of 231 Dem Cowards Talking To 4 Walls. SHAME.
@mmwlawtaos @gregpmiller  thanks, but you know #gop has sold us out to Putin & won't allow investigation. #russiagate
that is a bunch of crap you Damolrats need to friggin suck it up you lost fair and square this is sickeninggrr
excellent! I emailed my Senators and congressman in NY today to ask for an investigation
Thank you, Senator!
Woo! Thank you Senator Klobuchar! This is incredibly important. Thanks for taking a principled stand.
This was a coup, between Russia hacking & FBI. Did GOP or Trump team have any knowledge or involvement.
You must stop this election process. Do you not see this as an ATTACK on  USA? Investigation after the fact will not save us.
Psychological Projection of "rigged" elections, email secrets and crookedness = the plain-sight clue.
.@ReneeLascala @washingtonpost Precisely. Projection is key to his rhetoric and should be important in stopping his progress.
Thank you!  @clairecmc are you in? #LockThemUpandRunItBack
Yes, please.  And be the aggressive prosecutor who convicts for wrong doing.
As should every sentient American. Also demand disclosure of peotus+entourage's trades, tax history AND telecom.
@DemFromCT @washingtonpost Please apply pressure now! This is urgent. Get your colleagues on the airwaves fighting. Start now!
@avengingmomgel @washingtonpost Thank You !
Everyone wants to know, did they TRY or DID they succeedHighly irresponsible to put this out & leave it @amyklobuchar @cbba21 @gregpmiller
@CoralSeason8 @washingtonpost How does WaPo know about it if it was a secret document?
Let's play dumb everyone! I love when people who ridiculously claim 3 million people illegally voted pretend to be skeptics.
Give them hell, Amy. Thx for speaking up.
@clairecmc hope to see the tough women of the Senate leading the way on this.
thank you for standing up for our democracy
thank u Senator, we need you. Hope others follow your lead.
Please use your knowledge so MrTrump is not our president. Remember Watergate? This is a million times worse.
Thank you! @The_Parishioner
I hope so. Something needs to bebdone and soon !@washingtonpost
Senator, when you call for an investigation, does that mean you will make it happen? Not sure of Senate rules.
We should not allow the inauguration to happen until we figure out what the hell is going on.
Thank you for fighting for us. This will be tough, but we must not give up. The people of Minnesota are with you!
@gregpmiller THAT'S OUR SENATOR AMY!!! HEARTFELT THANKS FOR YOUR  LEADERSHIP.  I need you!
Didn't the Obama administration interfere in Ukraine in 2014?
Senator Klobuchar thank you for your strong leadership! This impacts our democracy!
@peterncox @gregpmiller I don't trust her; thankfully she won't be doing investigation
. Why? Facts please. No GOP talking points or bullshit.
what should be investigated is the DNC corruption and MSM influence and bias reporting to sway voters for HRC!
regardless of Russian influence, the info brought to light was VALID truths into DNC and HRC corruption
the reports I read indicated there was no certain indication of Russian influence.
Thank you.
don't ever let up. WE need you desperately. #nevertrump
Where was the outrage in all the government hacks before this?
Thanks for addressing this. We need OUTRAGE from our Dem Senators. Game is different. No more nice.
McConnell stopped this from being released before election & his wife gets cabinet position. Call on him to resign!!
Can you get enough GOP to make this worthwhile?
@texyellowdogdem @washingtonpost what about delaying transfer of power
Thank you Amy for standing up for American democracy
I know it's important to understand what happened, and to prevent it, but will it change anything for this election? I wish...
I think we need to. The outside government has no right to impede on the U.S. anything
and then what? He's still president. Russia won.
lol.  Sen. Amy is this true report?  Stay warm down there...
.@amyklobuchar Feinstein ! Remember the CIA and investigation so keep an open mind on who is altering and affecting democracy @SenFeinstein
Thank you Senator.  Never before has your job been as important to the future of America.  Pls fight for us!
@JackieC1989 @washingtonpost trying (unsuccessfully) to feel like this will be helpful to something in some way at some point
I see a gap in Democratic leadership, Senator. Now would be the time to assert yourself for the good of the country.
It worked! And every Cabinet pick wants to undermine/destroy their respective department. Keep fighting!
Thank God. Fight like hell, Amy!
@MonaB2010 @amyklobuchar @washingtonpost I love @amyklobuchar #NotMyPresident #StillWithHer #resist #ImWithChuck #imwithher
I fully support this. Find concerned Republicans in Congress and urge them to join in investigating all of it. #russianhackers
Thank you Amy @amyklobuchar
