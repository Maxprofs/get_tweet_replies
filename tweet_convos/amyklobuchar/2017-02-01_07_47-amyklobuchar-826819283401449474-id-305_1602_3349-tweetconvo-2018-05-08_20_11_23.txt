@SenFranken @amyklobuchar NO To Tillerson, NO to Pruitt, NO to Sessions, No to Mnuchin, No to Devos.  #VoteNO
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken Voting no is nice, but how will you BLOCK? Esp when GOP changes the rules? #resist with #results
You expect magic? What else can she do?
Dems are acting like it's biz as usual. GOP plays dirty, dems can't compromise.
And for the record @amyklobuchar has voted yes on all nominees.
Point being? Not all nominees are necessarily unqualified.
GOP obstructed all Dem nominees for 8 yrs. Which playbook winning?
Good! Now please support filibuster of Gorsuch. (I'm a MN voter, I vote in every election & primaries, & I'm watching.)
apparently she's the only democrat meeting with him
The key meeting today for Gorsuch: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Lone Democrat he's visiting.
Senator Klobuchar, MN voter here. PLEASE oppose & support a filibuster of Gorsuch!
Much gratitude!
what about Perdue for ag? Are you voting no? #withholdconsent on everything #ResistTrump #indivisible
Thank you. Why the yes votes for Pompeo, Chao, Haley, Kelly & Mattis?
- looking for love in all the wrong places
still no statement on Gorauch nomination?
she's allegedly the only Democrat meeting with Gorsuch
The key meeting today for Gorsuch: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Lone Democrat he's visiting.
and here is @amyklobuchar's statement released shortly after I sent that Tweet 8 days ago:
amazing  first time in years you are so supportive of republican lawmakers-but only if they speak against Trump policy-phoney
Could have started saying no a bit earlier there. Thanks, though.
NOT MY SENATOR and I live in MN.  Trump 2020!!!
I don't live in MN but THANK YOU for these no votes.
About time you got with the program!
you voted yes for too many already. people are gonna remember that come primary season
good! Time to row the boat for her and Franken
you seem confused, chad. i'm talking about opposition from the left. this is not your right wing safe space.
no need for safe spaces
I'm surprised at automatic "no" votes without evening listening to any testimony.
you do understand that the GOP wouldnt even acknowledge #MerrickGarland 's existence. Voting is at least voting
thank you for your efforts during the hearings.
You have my support. Also block Gorsuch nom. Make them use nuclear option. No compromise!
thank you for your work!
Appreciate you not voting no on all picks just to vote no- makes you more credible when you evaluate individually.
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken vote NO on ALL remaining trump nominees!!!  Make republicans own the damage they are creating
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken Thank you for standing up and protecting us and the constitution.
.@amyklobuchar @SenFranken @JoshWatchinTV no sense doing your actual job and weighing candidate qualifications instead of political opinion.
right, like with Merrick Garland.
I didn't agree with how that was handled either.. so retaliate? or be the bigger person?
They'll get confirmed any way so it's obvious you are pandering.  Trump 2020!!!
Thank you!  Now persuade your GOP colleagues to also, please!!!
thank you and keep fighting the good fight!!
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken thank you for speaking the truth And voting "no" for the unqualified individuals. You are my voice
plz pass on to ur colleagues tht we mean biz. StandUp 4 us or we'll sit down on you.  Democrats in Congress hve failed us.
Thank you for your #NotoDeVos vote & standing up for quality education for all US students #holdthefloor
Thank you!
Lovely. Now can you announce an exp for the YES votes we're so disappointed by? #MnVoter
NO to anyone/anything related to the scum. #ImpeachTrump NOW
these are the reasons you will be voted out soon
thanks for fighting as hard as we Minnesotans are!! Please fight the regulatory rollbacks as well.
I am appalled that you voted yes on 5 of Trump's insanely unqualified nominees. You have lost my respect. #RESISTANCE
But you voted yes on others...
God, hearing from constituents is just so *annoying* amirite??? Deleting voicemails is like, so hard!
why are you alone in these efforts?  Can you share your backbone with your esteemed colleagues?
But yes on Kelly, Mattis, Chao, Pompeo, and Haley.  I can understand why people are "reminding" you.
.@amyklobuchar You are not the free thinker we expect you to be. Sad
Thank you!
The people of this country need more than your vote, they need you to put your back into it. #StopGorsuch
and no is for CLOTURE.
you've voted yes too many times. You're not too be trusted until you really prove you're in the Resistance.
Instead of saying "stop bothering me," say "how I can better serve you."
.@amyklobuchar Thank you! Do you have any friends among GOP whom you can sway on Pruitt and Sessions?
How about you not get upset at constituents that are exercising their 1st amendment rights? Obstruct or get voted out.
Why did you vote yes on all of the other nominees so far? You can't be trusted.
we will keep reminding you until you do, in fact, vote no. It's unacceptable that you haven't been voting no from the jump
And your previous votes have been duly noted, and will be used against you in any attempts at re-election. We promise.
@SenFranken Bad Choices!!!! You vote no to the cabinet, I'll vote no to you. You 2 need to start rep-ing MN not your egos.
Thank you @amyklobuchar you should hold a town Hall in CD3 because @RepErikPaulsen seemingly won't!
though why yes to the others remains a question. Per chance, to maintain an aire for conversation across the aisle?
@TheAmerican22 
Guess your NO didn't work!
You have 100% support of we, the people. Do not waver, you have 65 million people to back you up.
Respectfully consider voting FOR Sen Sessions, Ms Devos.
nice but futile. if Dems had not colluded with HRC against Sanders this nightmare would not be happening. FIX YOUR PARTY!
Thanks @amyklobuchar for no votes. Please pass on to your fellow senators that it's past time for a principled, full-throated opposition.
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken please convince Republicans to break ranks.
Thank you for representing us!
Regretably,the spirit in which such a knee-jerk partisan act is taken demands a response in kind #NoToKlobuchar #NotFunnyAmy
Great. I'd appreciate it if you passed on to your friends in the Senate that you would like them to vote no too. Thanks.
Doing it right. Thank you for listening. @PaprikaPink @BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken
thank you
Thank you, Senator!
sure you're a mindless hack. You've accomplished nothing might as well keep streak going
Thank you @amyklobuchar Proud to call you my senator
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken U r suppose to be representing all of us shame on U !
and @alfranken thank you for voting no on the nominees. I appreciate you both for standing up and fighting for what's right.
Thanks, but perhaps you should pass it onto YOUR friends (in senate), so they all vote no. #midtermsarecoming #wewillremember
@BluzzieBird Excellent!!!! Keep it up. Must do something about this travesty every single day!! Resistance is not futile!!
@SenFranken Must b frustrating 2 keep getting calls BUT hope ur keeping count so the  knows just how unpopular the choices r
done
just spread the word. Thank you, Senator (from Saint Paul)!
filibuster away-we'll lose, but tables will turn in the next election.  We're here 4 the long game. Resist
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken FIGHT! Go along or they go nuclear, today. Get same threat from now on. Fear's no reason to fold
long time listener, first time caller. Conflicted on the conflict. How to balance values and reason with the unreasonable?
You are wrong. I use to respect you but no more.
now who's the party of NO
pull your shit together. Someone needs to #RiseUp . We are watching you.
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken  glad to hear this. concerned about the next election cycle. I'm paying attention. won't  forget
Thank you so much for voting no! Keep up the good work!
OK glad to hear it senator. Please block the extreme conservative nominated to the Supreme Court as well.
My trust is in Amy. Amy for POTUS 2020!
thank you for opposing.  Time for Dems to start leading- majority of popular vote, looking for hope
.@amyklobuchar thank you Senator for taking a stand! We need democratic muscle right now! #flexit
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken Thank you!!
so where is your answer??
except you didn't...
retweeted for you. Thank you for voting no
@tweetMalena   Thank you Senator Klobuchar.
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken thank you!!!
showing that you do not represent me. Good thing your past leader made it easy for us.  Adults are on it.
I don't understand how you can say you were voting no on Trump's cabinet selection. In fact, you voted yes on all 5.
Verification link? If true this needs to go viral.
posted NY Times link.
Who did? Where is it? Not seeing it.
I truly love what you do I am sure its a stressful job, one you signed up for No should have been for all.
thank you
Thank you Senator.  The fight not to regress to the 16th century is going to be protracted and intense.
@wrightco0704 How about Price?
THANK YOU!
why did you vote yes for tillerson?  This is ridiculous
get used to losing! Oh wait, your a democrat! 
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken 

Thank you Senator Klobuchar!
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken 

Hoping you have one more R friend who will vote NO on Devos!! This is huge for spec ed families!
@bett1230 thank you
Thank you Senator, please reach out to potential Republican Senators to defeat DeVos #DumpDevos
@BarrysFreeWill We won't forget that you voted to confirm Mike Pompeo. That was a big mistake. And we're paying attention.
After voting Yes for 5 in the past shows your personal feelings are guiding your politics rather than your wise judgement.
Thank you Amy we are proud of you.
Thank you, Senator!
What happened to voting no?
You are now a leader in the Senate so please lead the much needed opposition!
- thank you and all senators who are standing up for our best interests
.@amyklobuchar Thank you, Sen Klobuchar.  Please vote no on Gorsuch for SCOTUS as well.
Fillibuster Gorsuch until Garland gets his shot. Tell Gorsuch he has to get in line!
You did not announce you would not do your job and attend Finance meeting.
thanks 4 replying to this follower. we need tough dems right now
I hope you do vote no but curious as why you've voted YES and all nominees thus far
THANK YOU!
well done.
Thank you, Amy!
I'll go ahead and keep writing to your office with my opinions, if only to help you staff keep a tally.

Why isn't this trending???! #TrumpsAmerica #TrumpBan 
is there anything we can do about Bannon? Or is it too late?
Thank you for keeping your integrity. I am not a constituant, per se, but I appreciate your efforts. Bannon is my #1 concern.
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken Thank you, Senator! You are in a tough situation, but I appreciate your grace under pressure.
Carry on, hold the President accountable for his actions and for what he says.
this is why I am proud you are my Senator!!!
.@amyklobuchar We want and need more vocal opponents to Trump. Bold leaders in your party. We expected it to be you and @alfranken
disappointed you can't do anymore than the party line. It's why Trump is president.
Thank you for being a voice of reason and conscience. MN loves you!
Expect no less from you. This is no time for Minnesota Nice and hotdish. Go hard against the GOP at every opportunity! #resist
Your job is to represent the people, our job is to let you know our opinions on important decisions you're going to make.
 for voting against Sessions. Stay strong  on Withholding Consent. B/c of SCOTUS pick, filibuster everything! #stolenseat
Thank you for the no votes.  I tell my out of state friends, my senators are on board with keeping out the worst nominees
Thank you for standing up for America - for us. GOP is attacking our rights & freedoms. America is under attack from the right
Would appreciate it if you pass it on to YOUR friends. Thanks
Still don't understand why the last 5 were a YES for you?
And thanks for doing so
@SenFranken Excellent! Please, no more yes votes. None of the nominees even makes sense IN these departments!
as a MN constituent, veteran and military spouse I believe Mattis was a good choice.
Sessions&
Thank you for revealing your true colors Senator.
Thank you
thank you for standing with us! Even though the battle seems futile at times we can't go unheard
Please post your "announcement on your Facebook and website too". I'll retweet this for you.
thank you!
I'm a constituent in 56601. PLEASE Stop EVERYTHING until, you know, we can figure out WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON! #TaxReturns
voting no isn't enough to make up for the damage you've done. You need to actively obstruct every nominee.
never one to pass an opportunity to keep things churned. Try being bipartisan once, you might like it.
Good to know. Thank You.
thank you for your promise to vote no, and for listening to your constituents!
@ttthomas1 Oh, you're getting too many calls and letters, you say?
@Varidienne too bad you voted yes on some
Acting exasperated about constituents asking you to vote no on Trump noms, especially after you voted yes on 5, is a bad look.
We will tell you every day to vote no on them if we want to because you've shown we can't trust you to resist his agenda.
and because she works for us
What about Puzder?
Thank you
thank you!
makes it easy to vote no to you
@BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken now they're voting without you?! We're losing our democracy. 
Thank you!
in fact, stop the vote. Who cares about no when we know you are going lose. Disrupt
Good because we are watching how you all are voting!
We are watching Dems...illegitimate election, illegitimate president, and gop are bending/breaking rules to pass nominees.
thanks, but perhaps you should pass it on to your friends on the other side of the aisle & try to convince them to be American
Thank you Senator!
Thank you. I'm glad to see you take a firm stand against the corruption and incompetence in this cabinet slate.
What I'm hearing is "Yeesh, stop the phone calls!" which means it's working. Don't let up.
@deray Love you dear Senator
@deray @BarrysFreeWill @SenFranken and keep voting NO!!
Thank you!
Every voice will be heard, people are concerned enough to make sure theirs counts! #NoDevos #NoSessions #NoTillerson #NoPruitt
.@amyklobuchar @SenFranken @JoshWatchinTV right.. nothing like a good 'ol partisan uninformed vote decision before hearing even starts..
Thank you!
the dems could at least show up -  boycotting serves no purpose - get in and ask questions
More @amyklobuchar -s please.
I have already announced I will vote no on all the nominees you mention below. Would appreciate it if you passed on to your friends. Thanks https://twitter.com/barrysfreewill/status/826805069802790912 …
Thank you Senator. The amateur hour.
.@amyklobuchar If nothing else, you could look at it as people thanking you for voting as such...
could you get @SenatorCantwell and @PattyMurray on board too?
That's cool, we'll pass that along as long as you tell all your friends to vote No too.
Disappointed u voted yes on 3 nominees so far. The people marching in the street wish you would "march" with us in your votes
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar!
THANK YOU.
And NO to any Democrat of Trump nominates them. Just say no.
@GeorgeBaileyDog Thank you!!!
@Varidienne Well it doesn't seem to matter anymore, Republicans decided they don't need us anymore. #DeathofDemocracy
Constituent. Not been impressed by your voting record so far in the 115th Congress. Primaries are only a year away.
