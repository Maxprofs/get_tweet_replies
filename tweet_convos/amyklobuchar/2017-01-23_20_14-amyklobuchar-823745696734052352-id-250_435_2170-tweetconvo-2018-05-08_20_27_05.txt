.@amyklobuchar There is a rumor that you will vote to appoint @BetsyDeVos I find I hard to believe. Please tell me it isn't true!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you for voting NO on DeVos, Senator Klobuchar!
No vote. She may be qualified (I disagree) but you add legitamacy to the worst and most unhinged prez ever. Dont kill democracy by 1K cuts
thank you senator Klobuchar! We're relying on your leadership to convince a few more GOPs to deny her confirmation. #Anxious
wonderful. However why vote for Pompeo who could reinstate torture? #amyklobuchar #PompeoConfirmation
I have to agree. Please address this. It's quite disappointing.
Good call, Amy
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar!
Well don't vote for Zinke! Unless the boundary waters and wilderness don't matter to you anymore.
very disappointed with #NikkiHaley based on her recent statements. #concernedforthiscountry
thank you.
but voted yes to Pompeo? #disappointedmnvoter
thank you for standing strong against DeVos. U.S. teachers and students deserve better!!
Thank you for your "No" vote on DeVos!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you. My 15 year old son, had conerns about DeVos. I'm sure she's nice but not competent.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos   Please don't support Trump's nominees.  The majority of the nation did not vote for him.  No mandate!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos  Betsy DeVos is totally unqualified! Reform is needed but not dismantling public education! Thanks!
 how about Price?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOTES.
While I appreciate most of your efforts, I cannot believe you voted for Wilbur Ross. Or Mike Pompeo.
You shouldn't vote for any of a would-be dictator's flunkies.
As a college professor, I thank you for your support of education. Please help convince others that DeVos is not qualified.
Sen Klobuchar: would you have voted for Haley if you knew she would threaten our allies at UN?
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you for your vote. Now please oppose Sessions and Tillerson
Thanks for voting against DeVos!
Thank you for pledging no votes for DeVos and Pruitt.  Please oppose #Gorsch for #SCOTUS. Please join the # Resistance @amyklobuchar
Thank you, Senator! My sweet son has high-functioning autism (Asperger), & DeVos would be a death sentence for his education.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos  thank you for standing up against Pruitt's nomination
Did you vote no for Ben Carson? As someone who relies on HUD I don't want $1 of my rent money going to Trump towers.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank-you for committing your vote to public schools and our students!!
please tell us Carson will not lead HHS, that would be INSANE!
Thank you for voting against DeVos and Pruitt!
Ty Senator for standing against #Pruitt
when can we impeach? Who initiates this?
Thank you for this, Senator, and for all your brave work!
Thank you for your excellent work!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos -- Thank you!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you Senator. Betsy is clearly NOT qualfied
Thank you for standing up to King Donald!
Nikki Haley has zero experience with foreign relations and denounces the UN. hardly a fit ambassador. Please vote no.
disappointed you voted for Pompeo. We are trying our best to stand up to Trump administration, how about you?
vote for Haley makes no sense.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos why Haley? Just explain the distinction among unqualified nominees.
disappointed in your vote for Mike Pompeo. He supports waterboarding and increased data collection on private citizens.
thank you, Amy. #makemnproud
Thank you for standing up for what's right when others won't.  I'm very proud to have you as my Senator.
Words can't express how glad I am to hear that you won't be voting for DeVos!
Thank you, @amyklobuchar  for not voting @BetsyDeVos - the choice is clear and she is not it!
what about Sessions vote?
Nikki Haley is terrible, do you support Trump's vision of the world?
Thanks for No on DeVos & Pruitt - please say No to Price too & tell all Senators they represent a whole state & our country.
thank you!
Thank you fro not voting for DeVos or Pruitt. None of his choices are qualified for their positions in his anti-cabinet
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos good choice Klobuchar. Wearing red tomorrow.
well if you're not voting for Devon and Pruitt then neither am I! Oh wait, I don't get to on this. You can be my proxy :)
err: DeVos....
Thank you!
thanks for he information.   What about Price?
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you Sen Klobuchar! The thought of her running the Dept of Ed was frightening!
Thank you for standing up for Minnesotans!
Thank you. Pruitt and DeVos don't belong in our national government.
Senator, I am a Minnesota resident. How can colleague Jeff Sessions not garner your vote vs. atrocious Loretta Lynch?
Nikki Haley - you have to be kidding — https://www.thenation.com/article/nikki-haleys-pay-play-politics/ … — what degree of corruption would trigger a “no” vote?
why Mikki Haley?
@PembrokeTF @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos tks Senator
Why? Did your colleagues on the other side of the aisle vote to confirm Obama's supreme court pick? No? They didn't?
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos that's my girl Amy!!! I'm so proud to be represented by you.
please issue a statement to your constituents on why you voted in favor of Pompeo. We deserve as much.
Thanks for opposing these two nominations.  But please don't take wolves off the Endangered Species List. Look at the science!
Thank You!
any explanation for the Pompeo vote? People are troubled
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you for standing up to Pruitt and DeVos!
She admitted knowing nothing about her position.  How can you support that?
Keep fighting for us. We appreciate you!
Care to explain this vote?
Appreciate that but so, so disappointed you voted for Pompeo.
Thank you for the advice.  It's so much more helpful than prohibiting communication like the current U.S. Const. Art II holder
I am with you on this. Very good.
We're keeping a running list of who betrays us by siding with this Fascist Regime. Just so you know. #WeAreWatching #WeVOTE
Stay strong and stand your ground, Senator. We are all counting on you!
You should be voting NO on every single one of Trump's nominees!! They're all a nightmare for this country!!
Nikki Haley?? THAT WACKJOB??? You're joking, right???
Sit down
@metaquest @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos why would you vote for any1? We need to fight at every turn #StrongerTogether #theResistance
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos ( ... is that sexist...)
You oppose school choice and any measure that increases the quality of education for the children if it defies the NEA?
@SiadAli @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thx for asking and responding! #NEA #EdMN
Go Amy!
Thank you. Haley most sane rational one I've seen. Plz vote no Sessions & Tillerson. Tillerson = Putin reward. Sessions knows.
THANKYOU for your commitment to vote NO on DeVOS, Pruitt! #ResistTrump #resisttrumptuesday
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you
#thank you for not voting for deVos!
Thanks Senator Klobuchar! We are all so grateful to have you as our Senator.  @EnvDefenseFund & @Democrats support you!
Why did you vote for Haley and Pompeo? An opposition party should oppose Trump's agenda.
Thank you Senator Klobuchar!
thank you for not voting for Nancy DeVos
keep it up Senator Klobuchar! Thank you for representing MN values!
thank you for your plan to not vote for DeVos or Pruitt.
Thank you!!!!!

thanks amy!
Thank you for not supporting DeVos or Pruitt.
Thanks Senator for all you do. We all need somewhere to live. Pruitt would be disastrous for the environment
Thank you for your thoughtful work.
THANKS for voting against these two terribly unqualified candidates! re: Pruitt - climate denial has no place in the cabinet
Thank you for not voting for DeVos or Pruitt.
I would like to know your reasons for not voting for these two nominees Amy. You should disclose your reasons to your constituents.
But NH is okay? No. Vote against whole #SwampCabinet, or we'll remember in 2018. Those of us still alive after the ACA repeal.
Thank you Sen. Klobuchar! I hope that you can convince Republican Senators to vote conscientiously - against DeVos and Pruitt!
Glad you won't vote for supremely unqualified #DeVos. Pls convince @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski to do right by rural kids.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you for thinking of the future of our planet!
Thanks  for standing up for public education by voting against @BetsyDeVos . I'm proud of my Senator!
Thanks for not voting for DeVos or Pruitt, Senator Klobuchar!
Thank you very much Senator Klobuchar!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos you look like my friend Louise
Thank you so much, Senator Klobuchar!
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Please continue to oppose his nominations and policies.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you so much for looking out for this country's best interests. At least there is one in the crew!
Thank you for saying no the the dangerous choice of Scot Pruitt!
Thank you, keep up the good fight!
Glad you took this popular stand. Would that you would have been equally responsive to your constituents on the Dark Act.
Thank you Amy Klobuchar! So proud to be able to call you our Senator!!
Thank you.  And please keep holding Trump accountable for all the lies.
sad you believe this 'unqualified' narrative yet Obama was qualified? Approve our President's picks or be replaced. #MNisRED
Nikki will be a good ambassador.  She does her homework and will be open to help.
@sjwteach Senator, will you be explaining why you voted for Pompeo?
@AFTunion @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos great choices I hate to say this but we need someone with ties to 2 largest allies.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos please stop Tillerson and Flynn!!!
@MinnesotaDFL @BetsyDeVos support your opposition to DeVos and Pruitt! Both bad for our country and democratic values
thank goodness, she's uneducated, bad quality for education nomination! Sending u a letter regarding my HUD housing.
Thank you, Senator. Please continue to share your vote intentions. But why the vote for Pompeo? And what about Sessions?
and Rex Tillerson
Thank you, Amy!
Thank you for taking a stand for education!
Please do not change your mind on DeVos or Pruitt! Thank you.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos exactly how I would vote!

@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos happy to see you're voting against DeVos and Pruitt; disappointed with Pompeo vote.
Thank you. I wish you would also oppose Haley, Sessions and Tillerson.
Thank You, Devos is dangerous for education...
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you for not voting for DeVos, she is absolutely not qualified.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos glad you are voting against DeVos, my Senator, she is so unqualified.
You voted YES to confirm Pompeo for CIA Dir. so I guess you are cool with torture now?  https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/senate-roll-vote-confirming-mike-pompeo-to-be-cia-director/2017/01/23/5cd9c208-e1ee-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html?utm_term=.033191cf1ead …

@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you Senator Klobuchar!#Savepublicschools
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos 

Please try to convince your R friends to vote against Devos. She will kill us in public ed! 
Why did you vote for Pompeo?  Scary choice.
thanks for this message! I'm relieved!
Please tell us you will also stand against Tillerson and every other appalling nominee.  We're watching!
#disappointed
I know, right?
Very glad to hear you aren't voting for DeVos and Pruitt.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos vote for people not party that's all I ask
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Happy to hear you'll vote for neither of those
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you Senator!
@jmeferrell @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos yes! Thank you, Amy!
Why'd you vote for Mike "I would hang Snowden" Pompeo?
thank you!!
What helped you make your decision about Nikki Haley?
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you Senator Klobuchar!
Good morning Sen. Amy. Indeed, Nikki H will be  great leader 4 UN.  She have background & wisdom & will ensuring UN roles...
Amy for POTUS, 2020. Our best hope. Wonderful Senator, brilliant and compassionate human being.

Please don't vote for Perdue! "Track record of putting profits over the well-being of farmed animals, air, water, and land...
What about your vote for Pompeo? You're one of only a handful of Dems to vote for him.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos That's our Senator! #proud
Why did you vote for Pompeo? Disappointing.
school choice is just location not education Interagency Day Care   Standards law taking federal funds = fed ed <> real choice
We expect a United front from Dems-no other way to beat GOP agenda, cab picks. We r very inhappy to not see this @SenSchumer
Thank you for posting it here - You were on my list to call :-)
For the life of me I cannot understand how Dems are voting to appoint ANY of Trumps picks. I'm tired of these Dem sellouts.
I wish you'd voted against Pompeo, but REALLY glad to hear a no on DeVos. Thank you.
Thank you!
as a MPLS resident I urge you not to confirm any trump sycophants. It is unfortunate you voted for Pompeo. TY for your service
@Toure @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Haley is one of the few who qualifies!
Thank you for voting against DeVos. I watched the entire hearing last week and was alarmed at how was wholly unprepared and unqualified.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you for opposing DeVos!What can the rest of us do to help before the committee vote on the 31st?
@Toure @sjwteach Will you vote for Sessions?
Davis, Puzder? (And please explain your Pompeo vote.)
Thank you for those but voting yes on Pompeo? He wouldn't rule out torture or domestic spying. Really?
really how is he qualified?
or did Pompeo agree to a full and accurate CIA investigation of Russian influence on the Executive Branch?
thank you for voting responsibly , very grateful to have you there!
yet you support Pompeo? Aka torture and warrantless spying?
are we negotiating now? I'll give you Pompeo if you commit to NO on Sessions, Devos, and Tillerson. #MN55401
DeVos is unqualified and completely clueless. Thank you for not letting money buy seats this time.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you, Amy! We need someone who cares about students and teachers!
Great job!
thank you for standing up for our kids!
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos thank you senator for standing up for a qualified candidate to run the DoE.
At 400 ppm, EPA endangerment findings in 2009 was fraudulent when you exhale 40,000 ppm in each breath. Wake up Senator.
@sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Those are the right votes. Thank you Amy.

@SenFranken has already indicated he would vote no on DeVos. Thank you, senator!
