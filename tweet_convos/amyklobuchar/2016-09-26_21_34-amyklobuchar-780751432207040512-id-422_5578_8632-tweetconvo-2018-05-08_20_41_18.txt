Nah.
CNN poll is a legit random selection of voters. Like this one from PPP.
Online polls mean literally nothing. I hope Trump supporters know that and are just trolling.
1002. http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_PostDebatePoll_92616.pdf …
well CNN just came out and said that they feel Dems were oversampled in their poll actually
Why should they? User polls provide no valid information. They called people.
Yes they called people in PPP. Serious question though. Where did they call a lot were asleep by end.
The random sample had agreed ahead of time to respond immediately after the debate.
That would seem more likely. But in that case isn't that hand picking people to ask ?
Not if the folks they selected were random. Asking them to wait a couple hours doesn't matter.
I'll give you that but still my a terrible result. Hillary should win the debates as the vet.
.@NateSilver538 Oh, Nate... your myopia in this matter is truly remarkable.
Deliriously skewed #CNN is your reference? Seriously?
#GoodLord
Anyone can vote in those polls, multiple times if they wish. They're meaningless.

Yes, but... http://yhoo.it/2dfPHqs  
“definitely skews Democratic” - @DavidChalian, Political Director @CNN
@NateSilver538
@YahooFinance Tell yourself whatever you need to, bud.
But, I do see your point about the many online polls too, though they do speak to the zeal of supporters.

@NateSilver538
That I can agree with.
@richardpbacon CNN said the majority polled was Dems so don't get too happy since 47% said they are not decided yet
but it's cnn...
She is the blame for everything!  and she can still laugh even though she got men killed in Benghazi.
Internet polls have Trump winning the #debate handily. Hmm...
 #satire #LaughAtTrump
but when will this show up in the probabilities?
@Toure why has KA Con...been lying all day?!

Nate, I am not joking when I say literally EVERY other poll I've seen has trump winnig by double digits.
Online polls have zero statistical significance. CNN poll was an actual poll.
The poll they conducted had literally no one under 50. I doubt hat makes it an accurate poll.
As opposed to online polls, where getting a statistically valid sample is literally impossible?
How can this be?!?! @realDonaldTrump's best asset by far is his temperament!

Which is TERRIBLE!

TOTAL DISASTER!!
is that one they fixed? 
failing CNN is something you take seriously? Seriously?!
America now knows the truth
"Do not deceive yourself," @Abihabib, an analyst's first rule. 1) It's CNN, 2) it's Nate Silver. :)
Wait, regarding Clinton's 35 point win: is that an online poll or a real one?
what does a CNN poll mean? It's the media arm of the DNC. I saw 10 polls that say Trump won and so did Michael Moore
CNN doesn't do an online poll. They do the kind that has statistical significance.
No, phone polling of a random sample of Americans.
because there are literally 12% more dems than Rs in this country. Math and science bitches
im sure what you were trying to prove but your link just proved you wrong. More I aligning to D
Romney did win that debate bigly, he threw out his whole campaign and pretended to be a Democrat
Bill got a new Bimbo:

http://www.laopinion.com/2016/09/14/alicia-machado-hace-campana-junto-a-bill-clinton/ …

yep that Alicia:
Well, if you get an abnormally large pool of Dems this is what I would expect.
http://time.com/4506217/presidential-debate-clinton-trump-survey/ … Gee Nate as a numbers guy you'd think you'd look at the other 100 polls that said Trump won.
@LisaHendrix What about other polls?
agreed he won in other polls by landslide. Cnn is part of liberal bias
as is Breitbart? Who's poll has HRC as the victor? 
1980: 80M viewers-86M turnout all voters watch the debate
2016: 84M viewers-130M turnout est. who r those 46M? not undecided
yeah we know you want clinton to win but she's gonna get crushed election day come, just watch.
Wait more coming.Hillary is presidential
Did those move the polls?
Hillary just sent this Biggest, Best New Microphone FedEx to Trump for next Debate! Wink Wink (; (;
Lets see, one who lost the debate, won the election. Interesting tidbit there. Shows what little value this debate had.
When this over we will never believe Nate "Shilling for Hillary" Silver again?
why did Trump get praise for not going after Bill Clinton's infidelity vs. his own;wife #1 with wife #2;wife#2...
You just lost credibility by giving credibility to a bogus poll - MANY more Ds than Rs polled. Taleb is right about you.
it's a well known fact that reality has a liberal bias #suckitup
Mediated reality - what you're confusing with actual reality - certainly has a liberal bias.
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @CNNPolitics @LesterHoltNBC @NBCPolitics LOL!
what about virtually every other poll? Isn't it weird how different CNN's poll is. Both were bad but this tweet misleading
http://youtu.be/303nMjmuIog  via @youtube thank you.
@ladeyday Hillary is up there with the big dogs!!

Hey Nate Slither CNN poll sampled 41% Dems 26% Reps.......RIGGED!!
Among all people who like her, She won.  Unfortunately those won't be the only voters.
zž5v5zo5z
https://twitter.com/immigrant4trump/status/780657376575754240/video/1 …
......anyone surprised given the D/R ratio??
We get closer to a Trump Presidency every day! It's getting exciting!
@MichaelSkolnik that's about as fair as a conservative using Drudge poll. I
@MichaelSkolnik lol CNN
and it's also the only one she won #propoganda
And it's the only "win" she got out of about 30 polls, so it's wrong.
CNN admits it's a biased poll. They probably closed it quickly before the votes were sufficiently measured.
@MichaelSkolnik c:@MMFlint
obviously that is the only poll you knew.

All but @CNN poll shows that #TrumpWon last night's debate. I expected so much more from  @LesterHoltNBC as moderator. 
I bet CNN cheated on the poll like they do in the news
CNN Poll...Nate.....
CNN? You can do better than that.
@RossDeLeonardo CNN is the only poll she won. Go figure.
sad Nate, your true colors shine. 
CNN a proven HC collusionist via @wikileaks - polled 45% Dems for fake win..
UR obsolete
Please tell me what Trump did to prove he was even qualified to be on the stage last night?
@milfinyo
i appreciate what you do but what is the relevance of this commentary? elections arent good in & of themselves, fyi....
CNN ? Breaking News!!! Stop the presses!!! LOL
You're cherry picking. Look at the Time and CNBC polls
...as was saying, outlier:
Ask Jake Tapper about that so-called poll
@roblmo Did anyone have Trump to cover the +25?
considering only 24% polled were GOP, why do you think that was? Most polls gave it to Trump
why do you give so much weight to the @CNN online poll in your article and ignore all the others?
Does this historically translate to votes?
Really meaningless. The next national polls will tell us which spin machine is in high gear.
Only CNN?  Haha. That's funny
cnn are you kidding. They even admit it was slanted to dems. 500 or so people really?
where are ppl finding pills that say trump won lol even foxnews and Repubs were admitting defeat in the aftermath
@waltmossberg CNBC has it Trump 55% Clinton 45% winning the debate. To each his/her own.
And in other breaking news, grass is green. @CNNPolitics & @CNN is in her back pocket. @NateSilver538
oh thank god
Love your polling summaries; but why do you post Twitter feed troll infested "poll" results?
how does the huge Dem slant factor into that? CNN said Dem make-up was +10 of normal and Rep was -2 of normal.
Wonder why she didn't win more post debate polls. Her rehearsed sound bites were perfect.
@AdamWBatchelor
@continetti Keep throwing out those false poll results. ABC,CNBC,TIME,and Breitbart polls show different. 4th Hillary, ABC.
LMFAO !! Tiny sample size and D+15. Not even close to being credible
Why did CROOKED Hillary avoid Trumps proposal he would turn in his tax return when she turns over the yoga emails. Holt sucks
yes but trump won every other debate poll but for CNN.
Ever? Bigger than Cleveland-Harrison in '92????
Did you forget. . It's CNN your talking about. Did you expect something different. Upside down cf. all other polls.
@YahyaJohn Only poll she won and they admitted it was biased.  Not your normal election

Neither should be President. They are both losers.
is that the only poll you look at?
@waltmossberg I stopped reading at CNN.

Of course that didnt result in much for Romney.
was it this poll? If so, I beg to differ
@waltmossberg that's shocking that a CNN poll showed that Clinton won. CNN is the biggest garbage news network
Nate, you lose Cred if only mentioning the Clinton News Network poll.
If you believe that she won, and won by 35%, then you are more delusional than the NYT.
seriously quoting a CNN poll.  They are practically state controlled media.
what about the other flash polls?
Trump supporters will rally now!  Watch out for October surprise with Hillary!
ummm ppl in masses have turned off CNN no one cares about CNN HAHA good try

but appears to be an outlier. Nearly every poll I can find suggests he won, no clue how they can suggest it but they do.
a pathetic sampling of 521 people in the CNN poll and you're bragging? Time has it 53% Trump with over 1.4 million people!!!!
CNN self admitted that this poll was weighted heavily with democrats,how does that affect your thinking and analysis?
@jorgeramosnews except nobody cares about your CNN poll just like nobody cares that Clinton was drooling over trumps wife LOL
A secret poll, conducted by CNN. Yeah, that's accurate. All MSM who put a poll out on Twitter,  shows Trump won. CNN scared.
@jorgeramosnews

"We won!  Did you see the polls?!?!?  So awesome!"

~objective journalists
who won the drudge?
@peterjukes Notice the Black tops have buried it again. Trumpy on his backside again. I'm expecting his old shotgun out?
@JessicaValenti ok wink wink Trump won.  God help us.
PPP poll probably more accurate
Oh Please. You're such a joke. Compare CNN and maybe 3 other websites to THIRTY. 
http://www.infowars.com/poll-who-won-the-first-presidential-debate/ …
@jorgeramosnews Jag tittade på videon som Expressen presenterade och hoppas Trump vinner Rena pajkastning
.@NateSilver538 @forewit what did u expect? It's the Clinton News Network.
@jorgeramosnews Dude its a Cnn Democratic poll. You guys lots the election lastnight
CNN? I'm shocked. The Clinton News Network you say?
if that were a fight the ref would have stopped it.
Wow.
@realDonaldTrump was i'll & didn't look good. Wonder if results would have been different if you listened via radio
also leaned Clinton voters more than before!!! You're biased!
http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/09/voters-nationally-say-clinton-won-debate-5140.html …
what happened to other polls? You are better than that
Even 'Stormfront' Nazis think Hillary won. And Guiliani.
http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/even-stormfront-thinks-hillary-clinton-won-the-debate-1787121521?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=The_Concourse_facebook …
What about all the other polls? You rely on the Clinton  News Network for your data? Not very scientific Nate.
@waukeslosh the only poll she one. CNN admitted poll was skewed on dem side. Thats called propaganda. Debt didn't double?
I watched the debate; she won. I'm skeptical of a poll that shows otherwise. @NateSilver538
thats your right. CNN admitted poll was skewed. Cnbc poll? Times poll?
do you think Trump won?  @NateSilver538
please be sure to adjust it down 15 points for the model.
Well, ya know, CNN is not the only one doing the poll.

PPP has Hillary, and many others have Trump won.

imo, Hillary won
Did HRC win any other poll?
only 3rd? That looked like a natural disaster. How is it not higher?
Oh..he picked the Clinton News Network Poll. Hmm...
and they shutdown the poll as soon as Hillary had a lead. Lol.
Except for every democratic primary when Sanders wiped the floor with her. Untill they included people who just read about it
Sander won with people that watched. Clinton won with people that read the biased media recaps. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-CRUt9XEUd2e3FNSYSuWB9Ac8u3kUtUk …
I want to know who those 27% are who think Trump won.
In case you missed it
Thank you! CNBC #DebateNight poll with over 400,000 votes. 
Trump 61%
Clinton 39%
How is Trump's margin in every other poll especially Drudge? You're oddly quiet but love cherry picking?
she did better than him.He can't stop interrupting himself. But CNN,really? Amazed they gave him any points at all!
disturb the peace
from the looks of it, Trump didn't do well but he wasn't expected too. He will improve in the next debate
What do you expect on the Clinton News Network ?

With CNN it's hardly surprising. Time + NBC have Trump as the winner and many bookies have shortened odds. :/
but Hillary lost every other poll
you should be ashamed of yourself, posting fake propaganda with no links to back-up your claims
@julianhuppert Clintons disaster in Libya and no solutions to ME cannot be experience she can be proud of.
Mr. Silver....that's only one poll. May we see more?
lol
.@NateSilver538  CNN admitted their sample favored Clinton. More dems in the sample. How can that be fair? You guys are so biased.
+15% Democrat? How is that not an unbiased or fair poll sample. Nice try.
LOL Its the only poll that has Clinton winning. Every single other poll has Trump 52%+. Clinton News Network...

.@NateSilver538 @McnealyGeorge and the sampling is what Nate? Go ahead and mention the sampling breakdown of D R and U. CLOWN!
the next election you'll be unemployed
Thoughts on this historical statistical analysis of debates? http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/09/clinton-v-trump …
@JoyAnnReid gotta be vigilant. Mitt Romney won the first debate. But then again... Trump is NO Obama.
Ever heard of ClintonNewsNetwork i.e. CNN? Maybe check out some other polls. CNBC for instance. #debates
It is a joke - they don't do polls accurately - they do them to protect Clinton- SHE IS STILL A LOSER AND WILL LOSE BIG
But.... but.... I thought Trump said he won all the post debate polls.
@HerringWSJ watching people so completely misunderstand sampling/polling in this thread is very telling and disheartening
Is this a significant poll?
Seems like a self-selected demographic... and were those numbers different *before* the debate?
Must be smokin' a lot of cracked on that one.
A reminder for everyone that @NateSilver538 has no credibility whatsoever. Anti-Trump from day one: http://i.sli.mg/CYW1op.jpg 
@AdrianKavanagh Yes, President Romney. Whatever happened to him?
That's because conservatives stopped watching CNN a couple months ago when it turned into the Clinton News Network.
you mean the #clintonnewsnetwor? Abc, cbs, nbc, time, fox, cnbc all show Trump winning.
laughable poll only one that said she won.. Dam you guys are funny
Interesting. Trump won every online debate poll I looked at (about a dozen), even on leftwing sites. #corruptmedia
The @cnn debate poll asked the question to 41 percent dems and 26 percent repubs thats why its so skewed.
John Wooden- He who fails to prepare, prepares to fail!
