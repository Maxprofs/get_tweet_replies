Spoke again on senate floor: pass bill to prevent those on terror watch list from buying weapons and need for background checks #enough
the government cannot deprived citizens of Rights just because they're on a secret government list...
.@amyklobuchar People were put on watch lists for writing articles this arrogant government didn't like. I know. I was one of them. #Enough
Nicely done!  Thank you.
@amyklobuchar
cheap ammo
Who decides who gets on the watch list? Is there an avenue to correct the list if a name is on that shouldn't? the Tea Party?
@NormOrnstein Finally! This is your moment to take a stand.
Thank you for voting to prevent terror suspects to buy guns on Dec. 3, 2015.
.@amyklobuchar so due process doesn't matter anymore?
.@amyklobuchar pass anti-assault weapons bill/this bill just punishes w/o due process people who haven't committed a crime
What about Due Process? How do u get on/off this secret list? How do u face accuser that put u on list? #bettermn #mn @kare11
Watch list needs due process and more transparency before using it to deny rights.
Thank you!
Thank you so much. #holdthefloor
@NormOrnstein 
@NormOrnstein But the problem is how terror list is made and maintained. Did you know this?  https://theintercept.com/2014/07/23/blacklisted/ …
.@amyklobuchar Secret government lists put together by whomever is in power. That doesn't sound dangerous or anti-American at all. (Sarcasm)
because you read @theintercept and like stripping rights from citizens with no evidence and hate due process? @CherylRofer
YOU ARE MY HERO
Thank you.
@carmenvellon thank you
@grammalilx12 Thank you - appreciate Dem Senators for bringing out in open the fact Republicans allow terrorists to buy guns
Thanks you @amyklobuchar #enough #filibuster #holdthefloor
#wheresbernie
Due process. 5th and 14th amendments. It's a thing.

SuchGoodPoints. The fact that so many senators refuse action on this issue equates a failure to protect their constituents.

Great job! We cheered for you from our laptop and kitchen table in Brainerd. #enough #AsLongAsItTakes
Thank you! I would also like to voice my support of banning the purchase of assault rifles and high capacity magazines.
@jconsolantis Thank you!  The NRA is not a branch of government & GOP has to stop letting them dictate our gun laws! #NoWayNRA
This isn't a horrible idea if you also provide for due process, less we forget who places people on list.  @UpAndAtEmShow
@stephaniemagui4 Thank you for supporting the Dem filibuster. #Enough!

But it's OK to be on #terrorwatchlist and be a DHS employee, as long as they are #Muslim https://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/12/congressman-72-dhs-employees-on-terrorist-watchlist …

Thank you so much for speaking (and supporting Sen Murphy) on behalf of myself and the rest of my fellow Minnesotans! #enough
How about no more handguns, no semi-auto rifles, no removable magazines. Limit to pump/bolt long guns for hunt/target/def.
Thank you for giving a voice to the women who have died at the hands of their intimate partner. #enough @ChrisMurphyCT
Thank you for showing Republicans in Congress how to stand up to the gun lobby. #Enough
You have my sincere thanks, Senator.
will there be restrictions, we don't want 2 infringe on R2B arms but still want to protect citizens?
Thank you! And thanks for your nod to "Uncle Dick"--that's my dad's name and he too loves to hunt and shoot competitively. ;)
thx 4 nothing! Prohibiting gun purchases by those on "no fly" & "terror list" would have stopped:chirp
