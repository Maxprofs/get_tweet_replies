@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Please run 4 prez in 2020. We'll need your leadership after America has been gutted
Sen. Amy, MN have proud to have you everyday. Keep up good spirit of democracy & human right in DC...
Thanks for voting against racism, hate and voter suppression!! #mnproud
Thank you. Would that more Democratic Senators follow your lead.
@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Southwest Minnesota opposes Devos, Tillerson, Sessions!
Until Dems learn to fight the GOP with the same vigor they fight us, we'll continue to lose. All Trump noms should be opposed
Truth. Wake up. Its time to steel ourselves. No legitimacy should be lent to this admin. Dems have had 2 stolen elections in my life. Im 31
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar!
Thank you Amy!
Re statement on Sessions:  the greatest violence against women today is abortion. Please help end it. #whywemarch #prolife
Nicely said, Senator. Im glad we have you.
Just need to get some Reps on board. Sounds like a few hopefuls have caved. Need to know why!
Thank you Senator! Resist all unconstitutional nominees and policies!
Thanks for opposing both these nominees
Thank you for votes against Rex Tillerson & Betsy DeVos & protecting America. Not the best for USA.  #MadamFuturePresident

#trumpskkkabinet
Rex is a really really good man. I think opposing him is a mistake.
Partisan politics all the way. That's Amy Klobuchar.

@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos 

But we need Rs.... please convince somebody like Graham or McCain or Collins!
Thank you for opposing Sessions and any attempt to suppress voters' rights.
Thank You Sen Klobuchar,  for not voting for Sessions

Thank you Amy for voting against Tillerson!
.@amyklobuchar @Medium
Thank you!
Thank you. Wish you were my rep.
Thank you. Although a number of Trump's cabinet picks appear incompetent, I think Tillerson is the most dangerous.
but you voted in favor of Pompeo to head CIA, who  depicted the war on terror as Islamic battle against Christianity.
Thank you Amy ! You take good care of our country
Thank you for the NO vote on Tillerson and the opposition to Sessions, Senator (constituent in 55455)
Thank you Senator! Please continue to do this hard work, it is more important now than ever!

@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Please STOP the madness efforts to destroy our country by taking down our president
Thank you. Although ultimately, and sadly, symbolic, your 'no' votes indicate your willingness to fight this damaging admin
I support your position on both Tillerson and Sessions.
@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos How can a sitting senior sitting senator be unqualified , but by POLITICS. Shameful

@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos  TERRIBLE DIVISIVE DECISION playing games..Sessions is a senior senator and judge
@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos great job! Now please keep Betsy DeVos from destroying our Education system!
Thank you, Senator!

Thank you Senator Klobuchar.   Voting against Trump's nominees and being "loyal oppostion" are compatible.

Excellent. Please keep up the pressure on this new administration.
@nancypreuss @sjwteach @BetsyDeVos Thank you senator Klobuchar!

Thank you, Senator. Why other Democrats are voting yes is beyond me, the Russia conflicts alone should disqualify.

Thanks Amy.
That's great. Where do you stand on Ben Carson?
