@NickKristof @washingtonpost The Corrupt Trump dictatorship maybe upon us?
Spicer is a PUPPET like PUPPET PENCE and says and does as told by TRUMP
@abigailtracy @washingtonpost Controlling the media is what a dictator does. 6 corporations control 90% of ours. Nearly as bad
He really needs to retire. Maybe he and Milo cabildo start a day care center? Guilt by association, Sean
Beyond frightening! What is going on indeed!
the illegals need to be removed...NOT GIVEN DRIVERS LICENSES!
.@amyklobuchar @freedom_306 @washingtonpost So, okay for Obama to do it but not Trump?
@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost
@PressSec @CNN now we know what a dictator we have
Amy, you and the rest of the pols need to turn up the heat. 45 has already done enough damage to last years
@SCClemons @washingtonpost Well @seanspicer you must correct the record & not go against Freedom of the Press
What are we going to do about all of this?  So much disturbing news - not sure where to start.  Impeachment articles?
@cnn 25th Amendment Article 4! @realDonaldTrump is psychologically unstable and unfit to hold the office.
Keep dreaming. Everyday you all cry about something new. Accept it. It is now being done this way. MAGA!
The body of hulk to hide the small brain of a troll.
just tired of the whining and"let's impeach because I don't like him" none sense. Let's get together and MAGA
it's more than "i don't like him" was not a fan of hrc. bannon alt right bs scares the shit out of me. listen 2 cpac
USA have sacrifices & fought war past/present 4 dictators were oppressed on civilized society...USA must maintain moral value
Oh just wait, Spicey is going to get it on SNL
. @amyklobuchar Amy, what can we do?
Spicer is only a sidebar...the real story is #TrumpRussia.
the national debt has gone down by 12 billion in Trumps 1st month ...
The Press Corp should have booted Spicer out by refusing to cover him after he was a confirmed liar!
that would have been interesting.
So, are the other legitimate news organizations going to refuse to attend until this rectified?
it would be cool but the fake news would really be flying
if only he would stand up and admit the lies he's told on behalf of 45 and tell the truth, he might save his career
This is insane.
Hmmmm....so the media that attended are not media? Some media are "entitled" and others are well, just upstarts?
yet Breitbart  was allowed...why are we standing for this?
Well, he hasn't named them as a co conspirator like James Rosen was, now has he?
HYPOCRISY!!!! but hey if he said it- you got it on tape- it's gotta be fake- right? Right!
So unacceptable!  I called your office on Friday to voice my concerns about this!
He did not bar them they just get the info from their peers who write real news not #FakeNews
chirp chirp Chris, go back to the impregnable Breitbart bubble. Only WH friendly media were allowed
Only the NON FAKE NEWS media was allowed...We are in a war to find the TRUTH
https://www.google.com/amp/s/weather.com/amp/news/news/breitbart-misleads-americans-climate-change.html …
can the Senate or Congress  request a mental health exam for Spicer? I'm serious. He is not stable.
It's not Spicer. He's getting his lead from Bannon
Look who else has dementia in WH. Wow, some folks don't get how much citizens value integrity in government. Sean is a joke!
he barred some media, not all. Granted, it was a stupid move, but your comment is misleading
Angry lill Leprechaun.
How does inviting over a dozen reporters constitute being "bared"? He didn't invite selected networks. Just as Obama did.
We're also very grateful for the wonderful letter you wrote to @kenwoodcommunitySchool
Wow!!
It is called #TheNewUnitedStatesOfRussia
@ehcsztin @washingtonpost It's his way of leaking to us to tell what's going on.
I Agree (BUT)  This is not your Fathers or mine Democratic party no Labor no JFK no Big Dog (Clinton) you're his pride & joy
@cspan @NPR Uneducated citizens, who can't separate fact from fiction= REAL danger!
what have you to say now @seanspicer? Try wiggling your way out of this!
It does make you wonder how Spicer looks at himself in the mirror each morning without crying.
Why would any news organization attend, news agencies need to stand together. Just subscribed to L.a. and N.Y. in solidarity
@RogueED @washingtonpost #lugenpresse #onlybookheowns
#ImpeachTrump now!! For all our sakes, #ImpeachTrump now!! Please.
hope those words have the flavor of uncooked chard. Quite sad.
Spicer has read his Nazi history and is repeating history today.
I would guess he got tired of SNL making him look like a tyrant and thought hard and long of a solution. ..
<sarcasm> December? That’s a long time ago! Nobody remembers.  Let bygones be bygones. </sarcasm>
Such fraudulent false words now.

REAL NEWS: In December,Spicer said barring media access is what a ‘dictatorship’ does. Today, he barred media access https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/24/in-december-spicer-said-barring-media-access-is-what-a-dictatorship-does-today-he-barred-media-access/ …
he was just being honest
Like an obedient Nazi.
@NickKristof @washingtonpost 
Because these media outlets became radicals ..
We are screwed
Amy I am worried about the growing appearance of fascism. Where do we go from here?
I think the people need to take a stand. I'm trying. Marches, rallies, postcards, calls but it doesn't seemm like enough!
@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost
.@amyklobuchar @red_winger Do we know anybody else who has barred media access? Think #Manus & #Nauru Cite operational matters #liblies
banning freedom of press is actually one of the scariest things they can do.. this is really worrying.
Today bar the Media
Tomorrow dissolve the Constitution
The Trump Doctrine
Real News: The news doesn't cover anything that matters. Elites crash the economy, News about Obama defanging dodd frank? nope
News about Wall Street getting bailed out and totally escaping any repercussions?  NOPE
News about tuition increasing exponentially while wages flatline? NOPE just complaints Millennials aren't buying anything.
News about the Nobel Peace prize president bombing 8 muslim countries so we can create more terrorists? nope
News calling for Stumpf to go to jail after defrauding customers? Nope.
The only News we get is pre screened to make sure that there isn't anything too damning to the billionaires.
I hate everything about this horrible country and all of you cowards who refuse to stand up to money.
@iprefer_pi @washingtonpost We need an independent investigation now!
@RogueED @washingtonpost Spicey talk out of both sides of mouth! Doing at same time, real accomplishment!
And he described this restriction as "expanding the pool."
hasn't stopped them from trying to smear the President at every turn...
that's been happening in VENEZUELA! Right or left are the same shit! They just want Power and Money!
Please keep resisting and focused on the real stories! Thank you!
@PressSec No one trusts a word he says ! The all need to go ! We went from Obama to liars
So we have to assume Spicer is now realizing he's working for a dictator-in-training!
@NickKristof @washingtonpost Let's see if he does it again and if so, Will almost all remaining reporters walk out?
.@amyklobuchar @OddlyB
This is what Trump wanted 2 deflect U from today when he banned media from presser
what action can be taking to fight against this?
@Hannah3219 @washingtonpost Hypocrites!!
@PressSec @realDonalTrump Did Sean forget what he said??
Seems to be a pattern of lying in the administration.
Bannon continues his agenda while Dippy Donnie is clueless and entertains himself. @amyklobuchar
@YarosisNancy @washingtonpost JERK
@svensundgaard @washingtonpost this Administration is untrustworthy and dangerous to our Democracy.
Yep, Spicey done a 180 on this.  Can't wait til SNL tomorrow night.
I honestly think this guy is just following orders. I don't think he even believes what he says anymore
@EricBoehlert @washingtonpost It's cowardly. It's a sad day. Never thought the @WhiteHouse would be filled with cowards.
This is so sad and scary. Does the 1st Amendment and freedom of the press mean nothing to this administration
Why are the Democrats not screaming about this on every media outlet? Yell, scream,filibuster. We need you.
@Questar1959Ron @washingtonpost #PEZ45HITLERPLAYBOOK =SPICEGRRL controls MEDIA @seanspicer @realDonaldTrump
This administration is getting more frightening everyday. Please have our backs Senator Amy.
Will you ever have Anything positive to say about the President. Half the state you represent voted for him!
Yet you endorse Keith Ellison whom is antisemitic, will not denonce Farrakahn or Sharia law, and ties to Saudi
yawn
#trump stepped on CPAC speech story AND diverted attention frm #russiagate & #FBI/Preibus problem.Dont let him
@EricBoehlert @washingtonpost Dictatorship is "your word." He was just repeating "your word" not his word. Watergun please!
@EricBoehlert @washingtonpost That's bc he's what you call a person where number 2 comes out. This guy is a jerk!!!
@EricBoehlert @washingtonpost Well, what do you think we are evolving toward!
@EricBoehlert @washingtonpost the worm has turned
@EricBoehlert @washingtonpost 
Therefore, he works for a Dictatorship.
Time for major news orgs to freeze out Trump admin officials from their pages and airwaves
no amy just barring the fake news! The rest of them that act like responsible adults get in !
Thank you for pointing this out! What can we do to stop this dictatorship?
@akhanukov @washingtonpost ...oh well.
Please keep us safe and protected
Disgrace#
Please pursue the Russian questions. Trump is afraid of the media and the truth.
@julietemmer @washingtonpost This should be the most tweeted tweet of the day and repeated until Spicer & WH make corrections
Good Great !!!
@NickKristof @washingtonpost So simply put, we are now in a dictatorship!!
Democrats MUST stand together and fight what is happening!!  INVESTIGATE Trump and Russian ties!!
How quickly they forget...

can't say we weren't warned about all of this.
TIME 4 ALL PRESS TO NOT ATTEND WH PRESS CONFERENCES. STAND TOGETHER FOR FREEDOM OF PRESS W/ THOSE BLACKBALLED!
that's a great idea!!!!
this is where our legislators need to keep the executive branch in check.
"deconstruction" is verbal barking for "destruction"
feels like we're living in N. Korea or Russia. Scary stuff. Please don't stop your important work.
What really sucks though is @washingtonpost & MSM have rid themselves of legit journalists. It's all propaganda all the time.
out of the mouths of Deplorables
care to comment @PressSec
Hypocrite! @amyklobuchar @danahaswell
he will continue to do what daddy says.
They are scared sh*tless the truth will be uncovered. Follow the money! #resist #russiagate
Well, depends on what your definition of media is
Trump checks "control the media. Destroy the first amendment " off his "how to be a fascist " list.
THAT WAS THEN BEFORE TRUMP BRAIN WASHED THE MAN.
What can our Senate or House do about these actions? Do we have to wait to vote GOP out in 2018?
So witty. You should write for SNL.
Please continue to draw attention to these outrageous sideshows, but INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN TIES PLEASE!

you're projecting deranged honey, it isn't pretty. This is the funniest thing I've seen yet though LOL
and with a straight face.
Stay in this, Amy. We need you! We also need an independent investigation into Russia.
Press should be relying on its own resources to investigate the White House!
So now we have confirmation.
Well, at least he admits their goals and objectives then!
but what can be done about it? The people putting pressure on @SpeakerRyan and the @USRepresent?
There it is. The shell game at work. Don't get sucked in, don't play their game. Stay focused on truth.
let's all be clear @PressSec aka #spicey is more like a castrated pig. He did nothing. His boss #PresidentBannon did this
this administration is marching towards fascism at a rapid rate.
@seanspicer sold his soul to the devil.  This will be his only gig ever. How could U do this to colleagues?
.@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost This is frightening and unAmerican. Every member of congress should STAND UP to this man.  #impeach
@RowanKavner @washingtonpost no they didn't lol such deceit, plenty of media was there today hahahaha nice try though.
@JanFinkCall @washingtonpost the hypocrisy coming from the Republicans is appalling. #reapthewhirlwind
Freedom of the Press - what can we do, Amy?  Tell us!  #RealNews
Real nice spicy, the first step to dictatorship.
Senator Klobuchar, thank you for speaking out against today's outrageous attempt to intimidate the press.
Interesting how the hyperbole changes depending on which constitutional amendment is pushed on.
Only those who will support and report the lies will be allowed in...things that make you go hmmmmmm! #WTF
the single most terrifying action of this administration to date.
When they tell you who they are, believe them!!!
Obama tried to do it too.   http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-obamas-feud-with-fox-news/ …
@dan_bernstein @washingtonpost This dude is a TWIT!
That is a bummer but can we get back to the WH/FBI story from yesterday please? We're all getting distracted again.
When do more ppl realize we've went through the looking glass long ago? Truth doesn't mean a thing to these folks.
The big danger is if the cult turns into the mainstream.
Or an entire political party. *Ahem* @GOP *Ahem*
It's not a question of becoming. I find the @GOP has had many characteristics of an idealogical cult for decades.
here's an article on Obama's bad relationship with press
http://www.cjr.org/analysis/the_president_and_the_press.php …
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP  #censorship?? Any outrage? 
That's all part of the fake news Amy, he in fact didn't bar the media at all..!!   @amyklobuchar @Yogini @washingtonpost
Garbage news.
@AlexanderSoros @washingtonpost He didn't say all media just the chosen ones just like Obama did. That real news too Amy.
"Information is the currency of democracy" - Thomas Jefferson
These guys R trying to take over the country, ignoring the Constitution & replacing w/Bannon's schemes
What can be done to protect our guaranteed freedoms?!?!
This is a really big deal. Something needs to be done to this administration. They are becoming a dictatorship
are we're living in Zimbambwe?
@CheezieBreezie @washingtonpost STOP, STAY FOCUSED on RUSSIA these are created distractions on purpose. RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA
how about no one shows up for the next press briefing?
This is reprehensible behavior and something we see in Communist countries,,,not America!   Invite them to Senate for info
need for press to band together and boycott whitehouse press briefings   #josefgoebellsrisesagfain
Call your cable provider and add CNN to your chan els. CNN cannot be silenced. Support free press.
.@amyklobuchar @NickKristof  spicer did it for the benefit of those who didn't really grasp what bannon was saying at cpac.
@SheWhoVotes @washingtonpost  bunch of cowards. They can't answer their questions. This is also a threat to the others. Sick.
don't stop reporting.
@halfofdave @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @KellyannePolls The Cheeto administration needs to get their act together
agreed
I believe that's called "foreshadowing." #TheResistance
.@amyklobuchar With respect Senator...it's time we ALL called it as it is....#AmericanFascistMovement.
becoming a dictatorship government
At what point does impeachment become a reality?  Seriously, Senator, how much more do we need??  @amyklobuchar
@NickKristof @washingtonpost who is bullying him...trump or Bannon? It shows that he is being totally controlled
@NickKristof @washingtonpost Okay.
He is essentially, white trash
THIS certainly is not what he told the people he was going to do if elected.
@NickKristof @washingtonpost please don't give in to a bully. Fight hard even though you might not win. Don't give up. Thx
Please do your part in demanding freedom of the press.  I called your office today.
trump not only likes putin he clearly wants to be like him and transform the USA into a 2nd Russia.
