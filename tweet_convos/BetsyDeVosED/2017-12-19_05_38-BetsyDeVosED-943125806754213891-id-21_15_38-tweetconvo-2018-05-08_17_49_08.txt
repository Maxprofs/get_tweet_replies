Make sure you blame teachers, not policy created by bureaucrats who have not studied research, have never spent a day alone in a room with 8 yr olds & don't listen to experienced professionals (teachers).
Glad they already fixed that! (I know this because I learned about past tense in my public schools.)

Trouble is, @BetsyDeVosED will ensure that his district soon graduates students who don't know how to *think.*
We cannot teach students the basics in education until they get past what's going on in their private life. How can a teacher teach a child whose idea of school is a place to vent their anger
THIS!!! Why is this so hard to understand?!
In the #USA, we have a HUGE number of TV hosts, TV commentators, politicians, Commercial AD developers who DO REGULARLY use improper #English #Grammar. @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @cnn @ABC @CBS @CNBC @NPB @NBC
Support public schools!
What is the alternative to students that just aren't interested.  Keep them in school until they actually learn???  Do you really think that can happen?

DeVoss could care less about public schools. She is for private schools only. Damn she even sound proofed her office. The woman is a menace to our children. She needs to go.
Oh Betty how much did you pay these people to say that?

That's simply disgusting! When are we going to teach kids the skills needed to get jobs, manage a checkbook and a household? How about bringing back Civics?

Not only is @BetsyDeVosED not qualified to be Sec. of Education, she also awarded a student loan debt collection contract to a company she has a financial interest in. How is this not a conflict of interest? Our students deserve better. #CA39 #PhilForHouse …

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …

Register to vote. Get two friends registered to vote. Throw a voter registration party. 

At the end of the day, this administration is bad for you, it’s bad for us,…
The @NAACP backs up its call for a moratorium on charter schools with something often missing in today's political environment - #facts. #CharterTruth
.
Can you tell me where this district is located? Wondering if it’s the one nearby.
