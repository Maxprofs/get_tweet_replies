It was not an honour for her to meet an uneducated rich entitled woman with no clue of the true importance of public education.  Clearly.
Steve you talking about every Democrat and RINO currently elected?

Did you ask her if she had seen you on 60 minutes ?

You're still here messing things up Betsy? That's very disappointing.

#resign and #goaway
It is a tireless activity reading these tweets...get a thesaurus. Even the bears have grown weary of your limited vocabulary.
Good to hear Betsy!
Betsy, you should never use the word "honor." But you should enjoy "Donald Trump And The Great Easter Egg Hunt," a delightful story that is appropriate for all ages: https://furrymike.blogspot.com/2018/04/donald-trump-and-great-easter-egg-hunt.html …
Look! A real teacher next to a fake.
Such a shame that you're now working to undo all her achievements. Resign.

Congrats, no mistakes on this one.
Psssst. You EFFECT change. Where's your proofreader?
Your praise is well deserved but it isn't honest  If it was you wouldn't be messing with protections for students. You are a liar!!!
This is just sick!
If this  is true, you need to resign.
Repeat after me Betsy. 

They’re called whistleblowers.…

Nah.  Every union hack administrator and union hack teacher should be fired.
Please define "union hack teacher"
Anyone teacher that belongs to the NEA or AFT.  There shouldn't be any public sector unions, and doubly so in the education system.
So why "hack?"
I can't believe you can find a person to stand next to you for a picture.
...get out!
The least qualified Education Secretary in our history. You are a stain and will be remembered that way.
She probably didn’t buy her job unlike you

It’s an honor to meet Civil Rights leaders? Who are you kidding you vile and morally bankrupt woman? You & @CEJacksonLaw gutted Section 504 and ADA with March 5, 2018 revisions to the CPM & they will be rescinded! You are worse than disingenuous!
Anything like your tireless attempt at DESTROYING the public school system you uneducated hack?  #fake
Considering how the union run public US schools fail to properly educate the students they need shaken up if not totally destroyed.  Since Carter established the Department of Education our students have constantly lost ground to most other countries.
This fine lady has forgotten more about teaching than @BetsyDeVos could hope to learn in a lifetime.
Since you want to attack the educators that are on strike, why don’t you fly your goofy looking ass to Oklahoma and say that to their face?! Better yet, just STFU!!
You don’t deserve to stand next to this amazing PUBLIC school educator!
Except that your tireless millions supporting charter schools and initiating cuts in education as secretary will always defeat us, the common teacher working within the system of public schools we all know you hate! #swampthing #educationdefunder
How many people do we pay for just to review your tweets for misspellings?
Not enough.
Read the room Betsy. It’s not going well, is it? #RESIGN

When are you going to get Islam out of our schools and get left wing indoctrination out of our schools? Please respond to this inquiry!

Divided Nation by "Those Who Write History"
Pretty cool you actually talked to a teacher! I’m certain you understood nothing and took away nothing useful, of course. Have you tried reading? Ever?
And it seems you wanna undo all that great progress and change. Betsy you are a garbage human being, and the people of Michigan detest you.
She should replace you,  #resign @BetsyDeVosED  all you did was buy a job you aren’t qualified for.
How the hell you still have a job 
 I'm sure you can give over $200million excuses on why you should stay...
And until today, you had no idea she existed!
I'm sure you could learn some things from Dr. Abrams.
Dr. Annie Mabel McDaniel Abram’s expression....
Did you wash your hands first?
You and Pruitt need to pack your bags & GET OUT!
Or...effected? Or impacted? Or anything else a 6th grader could write? That is, a 6th grader with a PUBLIC school education #shuturpiehole
I promise she hates you.

#STFU #HorriblePerson You make Jesus cry
Ohhh Betsy
You are cordially invited to my classroom from now until the end of the academic year so you can see first hand the Effects of your policies on public education.
Great job, Betsy!
If she was a rich socialite with connections she could be #SecretaryofEducation
#yousuckbetsy
Air head Betsy hasn’t figured out that the MLK  assignation date is about MLK’s sacrifice for freedom, justice, equality, constitutional rights of Blacks & non violence. Photo op doesn’t hide your ignorance.
Did you bother to stop & listen to how it’s done?  Or did you just pose for a pic & claim to be enlightened?
I wonder what she would think of you and your “ideas” on public education?  I can only guess!
Ms. DeVos you need to go visit “ ALL” the schools in Oklahoma and see what bad shape they are!!! Instead of B S photo ops!!! You are NOT paid to do prissy Photo Ops!!! Ma’am

Be quiet loser. You help support a racist. You care nothing for us.

Which you are trying to dismantle
Maybe Dr. Abrams should replace you as Secretary of Education.

Betsy-If u truly cared about our Education system u would not have taken the job. Having done so proves that ur judgement is flawed.  There is still time. U can restore our faith in our Education system by resigning. Do it for the Children. Do it Today.

You haven't a clue#unqualified
Just in time for her to see you destroy them all without you batting an eye . You yet again used someone for a photo op rather than do your job . Can I bring a plus one to your resignation party ?
Sad MSM didn't give it the coverage it deserves but would been all over it if some fools disrespected you.
Was it really? @BetsyDeVosED
Dearest Betsy—As the head of DOE could you please have someone grammar check your tweets before you post?  Pro tip: learn the difference between effecting and affecting.
Im sure she also wants to cut funding and student aid to public schools too
affect/effect
Dr king would not had any time for you DeVos
And here you are trying to destroy what she worked for. Resign’
Priority never given for the Teachers Protests yet? When do you plan on speaking or meeting about it? Thought Education was a Priority, Time to show your strength an get them out of this mess, get them what they need, take away broken chair, HELP NOW! @cnn
Betsy no one liked you in Grand Rapids, and now the ENTIRE COUNTRY knows you are an unqualified moron too!!! Stay out of politics, and go back to making soap with your hubby at AMWAY!!!  #DumpDeVos #UnqualifiedBetsyDeVos #AmwayIsNotOurWay #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
I LOVE her outfit!
whoa...you deigned to meet with a black person!!!! whoa...musta been some serious culture shock for ya, Bets.....betcha went home & took a shower and then told all your buds how you 'have to mingle with the unwashed' with this job, and they sighed with you...right, Bets?
The best change for our schools is a QUALIFIED Secretary of Education!!!
Even Grizzlies know #BitchBetsyDeVos doesn’thave a clue what she’s doing! #DumpDeVos #TrumpCrimeFamily
From AZ
Why not get rid of this stupid common core shit?
#ArmTeachersWithPencilsAndBooks.Future is in our children's hand! Our Teachers need to be well paid, they need supplies, accommodations, healthy schools with Classrooms furnished, to be able to learn, not rip you clothing old broken chair! Disgusting, Sec Priorities! @cnn
20 bucks says this incompetent walking disaster had to hire someone to check her tweets for spelling and grammatical errors so she wouldn't look like an idiot again.
(Eye roll)

It’s unconscionable that our top Education official won't commit to speaking out against discriminatory policies:
DeVos refuses to say on sending her kids to Milwaukee voucher school. Just 2% proficient in math and 0% in English.

Thats a cardboard cut out. WTF has happened to our educational system? Your kicking the can
Hi, Betsy. It’s “effected change” in this case. Tricky, I know! That’s why good public school teachers are invaluable. Grammar is hard! Also: PLEASE RESIGN.
Hate to say it, but Betsy is correct.  Affect = verb.  Effect = noun.  I’m sure someone wrote the tweet for her.
Hi! In most cases this is correct. However, when talking about change, effect is the correct verb. Here’s a link that can help (read to the end):
Pleas learn from Dr. McDaniel.  Thank you.
thank you secretary devos for believing poor kids shouldnt be forced to stay in bad schools because of where they live. Our kids deserve to go to the best schools regardless of what their parents make
Did you ask how they dealt w/grizzlies during segregation? You might get ideas for bringing it back safely!
Don’t sully our name! And I can say we were on the right side of history then and so we stand on the right side of history now. #dumpdevos
Take it up with @BetsyDeVosED. She's the one wanting to hand out pistols!
Actually she said it should be up to the individual school districts,and schools to decide about firearms in them.  Not to have beaurocrats in DC demand a one size fits all policy.
Points to you for defending the indefensible!
Resign.
It would be amazing if you resigned.
Great photo op.  You probably took a shower afterwards.
And you thought your statement was funny. 
Betsy,
I say this with love and respect (No Joke) that today would be a good day to resign.  You would help the most kids by doing this.
Your leaving this world would do more to help the kids than her resigning.
why?
