Dear @BetsyDeVosED,Please view and reply to: http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal … Emailed @usedgov 
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse please assist - thanks! 
Public schools?  Are you asking them how your cut in their funding will hurt the students are will the truth make you run to secret service.
Closed down Special Education Department
Semems like a rather odd and personal and bigoted position to take.
Betsy Devos dosen't trust Special Education Teachers because there has been physical and verbal abuse against Special Education students
Watch out for bears.
@BetsyDeVos Bucolic pics of rural sunsets won't distract the public from your anti-public ed agenda.
You mean the creative ways they're meeting the needs of their students despite your dept's best efforts to divert funding from public ed?
Take your gun. There might be bears!
Hope you the best success in transforming our educational system
In WY!? Really!? No offense WY! But How about visit a school with a diverse population, oh wait, you're racist like your boss.
Shame on you!
Plz come 2 rural S Dakota & help advocate 4 our kids w disabilities who cant access out of distncharter schools that offer better options.
These same ignorant folks still don't see how trump is unfit, intellectually challenged, a sociopath, a con man, racist, & a sexual predator
If people were educated and had critical thinking skills, they would never vote for a party that redistributes their $ to the ultra rich
every person trump appointed to a cabinet position is there to destroy it. DeVos will destroy public schools.Republicans love the uneducated
@BetsyDeVosED Public schools make our country great. #SavePublicSchools
Haha...tour any schools with #guns to keep out the #grizzlybears ?
I wish you were qualified at all for the job you hold.
If you haven't stepped foot in a school in 15+ years, you have no business commenting on anything related to schools! Much like Betsy here..
WY matters, but hope you prioritize states/districts most diverse in color & socio-economic status. #keepSchoolsSecular
By showing how they shoot sleeping bears to 7 yr olds. Great education. Way to go
Keep wasting taxpayer's $, traveling all over the country for photo ops. You lack the vocabulary to hold meaningful discussion on education!
What exactly is involved in this policy? Please be specific. A catchy title and some buzz words do NOT make good or effective policy.
Wyoming is a great place to find grizzly bears
Careful! Lots of grizzly bears up there.
Finding more dollars for charter schools in every corner of the states.
Excited for the day you're no longer ruining public education. #BetsyDeSaster.
It's a national shame that you are the secret of education.
#DumpDeVoss
Maybe they can teach you about education while you are there because you do not know crap.
WHERE IS THE FREEDOM?  
95% of students are federally mandated to take Com Core Compliant tests?
@stopfeded #stopcommoncore @realDonaldTrump
Ms. DeVos, I am inspired by your work. I would love to have you visit my classroom anytime you are in Massachusetts!

how about just keep funding for the public schools that don't need "rethinking" oh wait, that's not on your agenda.
It would help if you'd acknowledge #CommonCore is NOT gone due to #ESSA 
#RethinkSchool? How is this done w common stnds in common mkt?

Public schools are not all a "mess". You disrespect hard working educators when you talk like that.
Watch out for bears
Many friends here in #Gillette horrified by what you are proposing for our schools. Especially those parenting children with special needs.
#RethinkDeVos
You are despised by many here in beautiful Wyoming. We need strong public schools with equality for all, not your evil voucher plans.
@BetsyDeVosED, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana are lucky. Would you consider a stop in #SouthLA, CA?
No vouchers unless accept ALL & accepted as full payment; otherwise just a stipend for super rich 50 thousand yr Schools. @realDonaldTrump
U have more $ than U will ever be able to spend & no exp in edu. We the People do not want to invest in your for profit schools.
Great Betsy!
Are we only visiting Charter Schools Betsy or are actually going to help public schools now your budget was turned down?
When are u planning on visiting public schools throughout the country? #education ALL #students matter!!!
Why not come to New York...oh yeah.  We don't want/need you or your policies here.
You've literally never spent a day in a classroom that wasn't for a photo op. Must be nice to be able to buy cabinet positions!
I hope you have your gun in case there's bears!
Why? To see if any female has been raped lately and kept her mouth shut, as you would like???!!!
#RethinkBetsyDevos
Can we #ReThinkYou ?
We must protect the Consumer Finance Bureau , CFPB,  students need to be protected from predatory lenders and DeVos #DeloresUmbridge
http://CongressionalOrder101.wordpress.com 
Can you please get attacked by a bear??
.WATCH OUT WY!!!! This crazy hateful woman will destroy your schools!

ART FOR THE RESISTANCE
How would you even know?
Look out for the bears.
@usedgov you are a major threat to this educational system in the US...
Please get out of our schools BETS. You are doing nothing but hurting them.
Ma'am what does a photo of WY water way have to do with meeting teachers?? Do Your JOB or resign

Hey Betsy DeVil, I didn't know you could think! I was under the impression that you just did whatever your evil overlords wanted. #Fraud
Watch out for them bears out there!
Don't forget your gun Bets!!! Sure those bears will be out! 
Because they are desperate for resiurces@and funding they the federal gov denies them. You're a loser Betsy!
They frequently meet the needs of their students out of their own pockets because the Sec. of Ed. is an imbecile.
Betsy, Malpractice,
Academia’s failure to solve the Mystery of Human Existence is Intellectual Malpractice.
Shoot those bears... I don't care if other people posted it. Still a dumb thing to say.
What in the hell do you know about education, we all know you bought your cabinet post!!!!
#DearBetsy how about you rollback your rollback on #TitleIX?
#STFU #MAGA
Glad you're headed to rural areas. Let's focus on the issues that affect the most kids. Our 50-state report: http://www.ruraledu.org/articles.php?id=3297 … @AASAHQ
Wow. Just wow. SD is hideous
And then proceed to take many away from the teacher's resources
Nice to see someone in charge of the Dept of Ed who's focus is the students, our children.
The best thing to do to meet the needs of students in America is for you to step down ASAP
Keep tweeting your awesome work Betsy!  It's the only way we get truth of what's happening.  Don't read responder trolls just keep on #MAGA

Add music in middle schools and expand creative minds.
Thank you for your hard work. I am aghast at the low level of education from graduating students. Returning power to parents is key.
We have to be creative with you wanting to take our funding.
Please join us in Indiana to experience public schools meeting the needs of all students in this digital age
See this:There are no private schools & all public schools are very good schools so parents don't have to choose.
I thought you were hired to help the kids in school You lady haven't done anything to help NOTHING!!
#StopCommonCore #StopIslam Or step down
Fascinating. Starting in what, fly fishing country, Bitty?
#rethink?...why not simply FUND?
sitting here in Florida with no power wondering why I still have to speak this truth to idiots.
@davetg
Teachers meeting needs of STUDENTS, what a concept.Im guessing teachers in WY don't have unions,where students come LAST @RealJamesWoods
Thank you for all of your efforts!
Youre a ridiculous person and its insane you think you are intelligent enough to fill this position.
Thank you for your courage to challenge old standards.  Future progress depends on new thinking.  Old guard needs to retire.
They must necessarily be creative because they are underfunded. Your plan will make this worse.
Make sure the kids have guns so the bears dont eat them. Make sure u push ur crazy religious beliefs to them through my tax dollars #MAGA
"creative ways teachers here are meeting the needs of their students" = fun way to say schools are underfunded. also... [joke about bears].
If teachers are creative & meeting the needs of their students, why are we rethinking school? Sounds counterproductive.
#CruellaDeVos
We need to stop you from destroying education in America.
Please DON'T come to Idaho. No one wants you here. You have done enough damage.
Betsy DeVos - doing for the school system what she did for summer homes....

reminder that this is what Betsy Devos's house looks like

Architect: what kinda house u want?
Betsy: Just fuck my shit up 
I can't imagine a teacher being anything but horrified by having to interact with you. Luckily they're professionals and hide it well.
FOR GAWDSAKES LOOK OUT FOR THE BEARS!
The status quo in reformed Douglas County CO underserves SPED. Not one of 15 charters enrolls significant needs kids.
#RethinkSchoolChoice
Get DeVos OUT of our schools
Yu know nothing about teaching. You should not have this job.
Name some of those ways.....
Can't wait to hear about it! Share some pics with us as you tour. #JoyfulLeaders #Kidsdeserveit #EduAR
How would you know anything about education ? RESIGN
Let's #RethinkSchool by removing @BetsyDeVos from her post! #DeVosHatesPublicEducation #SavePublicEducation
Usually when one is in charge of the educational institution he or she has an education and understands the issues. You have neither.
Where are Vouchers!?
PLEASE end Common Core!!!  Get the federal government out of our classrooms!!
She loves common core. Honestly it was one of the issues she supported during her hearings.
Not good!!
No Common Core!
Humm, perhaps @realDonaldTrump needs to give u a "Sessions" lesson! @seanhannity @jessebwatters @LouDobbs @SteveBannen @rushlimbaugh
What about kids w/families busy w/ finding food -they can't choose a school-these r the most needy-I know it's hard for a rich lady 2imagine
So thankful for our schools being cleaned out, get common core out. God bless you.
Name 1 thing wrong with common core
It's not taught in a church 

So, just when ru going to take action-Common Core? @rushlimbaugh @IngrahamAngle @jessebwatters @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine
Horrified that you're in a position to have any affect on schools in this nation. #RethinkSchool
Its because of liberals destroying schools that home schooling is on the rise. #fixourschool #endindocrination
Yeah, I hate that my daughter is crushing math, science, Spanish and reading at 11th grade level in 4th grade, too.
Maybe stop having stupid kids that can't keep up? Signed, parent w kids in a VERY liberal school district.
You are woefully unfit for this job.. whose needs exactly are you meeting?
Come to north jersey and help our schools Chris Christie has put our children in a mess get rid of common core and invest in our children
And help spread rape culture
Your ONLYGoal, Turn Education, Into Indoctrination Centers. Private Sch Feed Your Ilk. Public, The Robot Minions. History Will Say How WRONG
Stop forcing your failed charter schools and religious beliefs onto a country that doesn't need or want your dimwitted and cruel "ideas".
Watch out for BEARS, you fucking twat.
keep up the great work
I am proud of @BetsyDeVosED. She is consistent, serves all children to excel. She served the community well before holding office.
'privileged White children...'
What limited and lying scope are you looking through? She invests in the communities that are underserved. She does it without a parade.
Most of these are facts, NOT opinion...
Must b teachers u understand @NOAA first accident is terrorist acts! Flash floods roar loudly ©™®Arrest unaccredited frauds.Arrived to harm
You are a walking rubbish bin.
You're a fraud and a loon.
Maybe we can get someone qualified to do your job sooner than later. #DumpTrump #DumpDeVos
Getting government out of education is the beginning of actually educating Americans.  The Govt destroys everything.  Let's make real change
Please consider stopping in Omaha, Nebraska on your tour. The Wilson Focus School is an amazing public school with a year round model.
Except she doesn't believe in public schools. She's a fraud and an empty-headed wallet for Republicans. And her brother is a murderer.
Watch out for bears.
Should the rethinking be done at the community level, where it is accountable? Will @usedgov empower localities? @SenAlexander @PattyMurray
Is that before or after you funnel tax dollars to charter schools?
After she spends a contemplative morning catching trout...maybe then.
Get Islam OUT of our schools
get Scott out of USA
You paid for your position. There is no way you are qualified to make decisions regarding the US education system.

#DumpDeVos
#Impeach45
Go to jail.
Bot.
Thank you Betsy!! Doing an amazing job!!  #DueProcess #IndoctrinationMustEnd  #MAGA
Bot.
Grow up. Bot u bud!  U sound ridiculous. Twitter is liberal. If there are any bots they certainly aren't on our side. #truth
U cute. 
i know, Bets!!!! Its great how they spend their own money to get basic supplies for these little peasant children, isn't it!!!!!!!!!

#DumpDevos
Resign. You are awful for students.
Do you have your outline posted of how you're going to remove the power out of the Union & harsh punishments for teaching propaganda?
Any grizzle bears?
Why don't you stay in your mansion and let QUALIFED people figure it out
She has a mansion? I wanna learn how to get me one of those!
