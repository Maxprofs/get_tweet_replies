All students, as long as you're white, Christian, & male. Oh, how are our fellow PR citizens doing? Most still have no power...
Not surprised!
Is this school part of your re-segregation plan?

Please resign.
DeVos is most ineffective/racist women to hold office. history books will detail her many failures both professionally and as a human being

Tell them to come to the U.S..
Notice the uniforms--maybe the US should try that-we let the Dems destroy our school system with their idiotic ideas
yes, we need a full on dictatorship.  Heil Hilter!
Yea what we don't need is another 4 years of Dems that hate the Constitution like that Muslim sympathizer we had for 8 yrs-couldnt say ISIS
remember when Bush got a bunch of killed in 911, then the recession?  remember Obama cleaning that up? no,  because you're a bigot
Each year just to break even with a normal economy- so 146 mil plus 2x8= 16 mil brings us to 162 million-- that's a huge employment deficit
See the real problem yet?
Betsy DeVos needs to #ResignNow
Heard the Great News! America is excited!
You're going to resign! 
That's absolutely the best thing to do @BetsyDeVosED
Why not do you [ #USA & #EU ] decide to propose an education law that includes "SOS: firearm injuries” ¿?

https://vivlium.com/documento-sos-people-with-firearm-injuries/4787/ … [ $14- ]

Every department is DESTROYING the regulations designed to protect the vulnerable, the poor, the disabled, the sick. #Reprehensible 
How about we ignore Betsy D, and donate to some kids in need   https://www.donorschoose.org/project/open-the-seating-open-the-mind/2874238/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=project&utm_campaign=twitter&rf=twitter-siteshare-2017-10-project-teacher_4616562&challengeid=20972180 … via @DonorsChoose
you're unfit to lead the educational system...
My 8 year-old ask why you don’t like him then he prays while crying that you won’t take away his dyslexia teacher. Shame on you.
Too bad not the same in Puerto Rico. Also some town have no Street names so how are people to fill applications on line?
And you are the second most incompetent person in the WH. Worse, you're a 'role model' for girls, & send a message that it takes a sell-out.
Shouldn't "Betsy" be making sure our schools & children are prepared for nuclear attack? It might happen while our children are in school.

Betsy, why don’t you go and defend some rapists and leave us alone...forever...

You're the worst thing to ever happen to American Education. You put corporate profit above students with every monstrous decision you make.
Private schools pick their students.Public can't. Funding is based on test scores. Public will lose funding. Don't fund private w/ gov't $
Clarify if it is true that regulations affecting disabled students were removed? Word is you did. I hope not.
You care NOTHING about schools or the students who attend them.  NOTHING.
DeVos rescinds 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students
DeVos is a child of the devil STEALING from American and education.  I applaud her botox for her age, but she's a FAKE mess!
Hey teach why don't you learn #DCDONALD some math...how, does the Market being up OVER 450% since Obama took office. And Corporate Executive pay up 9000% since 1978. $3,000,000,000,000.00 offshore. Equal higher wages for poor people. It hasn't yet..#DCDONALD idea i think..lol
Hi Betsy. Who hurt you? Who abused you? You can tell now! Women have voices now! Speak up. Now is the time. You are filled with pain.

Betsy - responsible for helping Trump/Mercer return the US to Robber Baron days. History won't be kind to her.
Know how to work. Are you grooming a new generation of illiterates. Maybe to do the dirty work as you eliminate our immigrant population.
You are taking away educational opportunities from children with special needs. They will grow into adults with no abilities.They will not
Is it true you rescinded 71 guidelines to follow for handicap students?!!!!
@BetsyDeVosED you must be proud rescinding 72 docs that helped parents & schools understand disability rights! #MAGA
DeVos rescinds 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students http://wapo.st/2xdvurM 
Hey Betsy. No offense, but there's a special place in hell for govt leaders (or any adults) looking to hurt special needs kids & families.
Kids are amazing and resilient. You are neither. #LevelThePlayingField
They went to school without electricity?  You thought that was a bragging point?  How 1% of you.
not enough.u need 2 find a sense of urgency 4 the ppl of PR.& if u would stop w/policy tht makes struggling kid's lives harder, wud b great
sending condolances to your family
Why aren't you speaking out about some to the socialistic indoctrination that is happening in our public schools?  What do you even do?
Sexual assault should never spell the end to a young person’s education. We won’t let Betsy DeVos break that commitment.
SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU Title IX is a promise to students: Sexual assault should never spell the end to a young person’s education.
Take them all back no more there friend.
Because you lead by example
LOL!  Her purse is "crying" because Betsy DeVos is using this photo to show her socialite, drunken friends how IMPORTANT she is to #Dotard
Devo's companies laundered data via Cambridge Analitica.... TREASON!
@DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS @CHPsouthern @CHP_Chico @AaronRodgers12 @ParisHilton 
Have started researching about sexual harassment and abuse by Catholic families in US who are related to the police..!
Long recovery process. US needs to help long term
Wow, thanks for the retweet Betsy. More minimal effort from you. #betsydevosisworthlesspondscum
How are the schools in PR and do you care
Nope, she doesn't
That's great, but how about #PuertoRico? Rather than @realDonaldTrump threatening to take away their assistance maybe make sure people have water and power??!

#PuertoRicansAreAmericans
Resign!
Can we send you to PR, Betsy, with a shovel and some waders? Get to work.
Stop effing around and help Puerto Rico
@DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrumpHQ @WhiteHouse @SecretService @FLOTUS B6603224/CAPops only bio child @ChelseaClinton 
No schools in PR are open. Is your plan to just let them all die so 45 can go in and make it a sleazy resort island?
You'd rather Hillary use them as slave labor like she did in Haiti?  Didn't YOU do an audit of her Foundation?  I did.
wow so you got all the foundations books and did an audit, lucky you
They look like Young Ladies! Very classy  They must not have filthy Communist teachers out there like we do here thanks to Obamba
Are you kidding me... That is their school!?!
That crying face purse is perfect for this press release.
I'm curious who thought it was cute to insert a crying/laughing emoji over the girl's purse?
That's the purse.... 
I don't buy it.
Zoom in.  I saw that purse just yesterday in a store.
It's a purse!

Amen

Yet Puerto Rico kids have no schools to go to, why? Bc fema is ignoring their needs
The process continues!  This is a great beginning. Thank you!
Great! St Thomas beautiful island!
But the area is still devastated... quick, someone get the president to tweet about the NFL or NBC, that will certainly help.
I understand the Hillary. Obama and Harvey Weinstein will be visiting soon.  Lock up the women and young girls
That was a little awkwardly phrased. But keep working at it, товарищ!  You'll get it :)

Only problem with this is Charlotte Amalie High School Students does not wear White and Maroon

All I’m saying is that Charlotte Amalie wears Powder Blue top and Dark Blue bottom.
So, by that narrative, yes
More boots on the ground @femaregion2.
Not to much to ask, @FEMA_Brock
More boots on the ground.

Ppl would like to know when u will submit ur resignation for refusing to help PR & comments about Mayor of San Juan?
Try some self help first. Might get a , little more sympathy.
Agreed, all the whining could be put to better use in helping help each other.
No whinning, called accountability, ESP for the gov agency in place for situations just like this.
