You are woefully unfit for the office you currently hold and in completely over your head.
I hope your ready to pay for private schools bc Betsy's goal, with Trump's approval is to rid the country of public schools. If private school is ok for the richest of American's well the rest will have to get another job or 2 to educate their children.
Fact check it, I dare you.
Also doing away with EPA & CDC, reducing Medicare & Medicaid, privatizing VA medical. Passing a tax cut to benefit the rich. 
The list goes on and on. But then cheating donnie can't really help it.
The GOP wants to return to the days of rich white men controlling everything. They resent the ideas of POC having anything & women having birth control. Make no mistake religion is NOT the reason they are anti-abortion & anti-birth control, it's all about controlling women.
Hi from Austin. With all due respect and reverence, your use of "they" is incorrect with "child."  A singular noun such as as "parent" or "child" requires a singular pronoun such as he or she. Alas, no worries  My .@devryuniv students do it too   #ProfessorP
Public schools are a joke. Loaded with communists teachers.
I agree. I advocate government support for homeschooling parents, provide funding for stay-at-home parents and the materials to do it. I am NOT sending my kid to public re-education camp with armed staff who may not be trained well.
All schools getting federal money must have to abide by the same rules and standards.
My wife is an awesome public school educator and I serve as a school district police Chief. Public schools served us well along with our children. If we adequately fund our schools, we will reap the benefits.
Truer words cannot be spoken.
Great. Where’s the funding?
This is about as clueless as it gets. What about students with special needs, which charter and private schools do not have to  oblige their IEP. Please tell me you know what an IEP is. You really have no idea about any children that aren't "typical" do you?
True, but when State and Local governments aren't fully funding teachers with the resources, it makes a differences.
TWO reasons existing tax dollars are NOT adequate; 
onerous Retirement Packages & Illegal immigrants! 
It's that simple!
How about video proof? Will that do it for you? What ignorance! Apparently none of you self-proclaimed experts have many facts! School choice is not only about charter/private schools. It’s mostly about being able to choose other public/state schools.
Caring and hard working parents not having the time or logistic means to send their child to another school is not settling...how insulting.  Help neighborhood schools become great. Spending time in them is a good start. Do something. Your inexperience is appalling.
We've got no where with the "experienced" . Thanks @betsydevosED for all you do
Only she literally does nothing but repeat words she doesn’t understand and smile for photo ops.
That isn't true - just because you say so does not change that fact. I guess you're repeating talking points you heard from somewhere - the teacher's union perhaps?
No, my repetition of a fact will not make it more true.  However, it is a fact.  How many minutes of her smiling while being completely unable to answer basic educational policy would you like me to provide as evidence?  Start with her flubbed 60 Minutes intvw.
Not true. Give me an example. I watched the 60 minutes interview. Just because you don't agree with her policies you just make up stuff hoping if you repeat it enough times folks are going to think it is true. People are smarter than that.
You are making a circuitous argument.  I am not making anything up.  She doesn’t know where the state she resides in stands in comparison with performance of other states.  She doesn’t know the difference between proficiency and growth.
Furthermore it does not make what I’m saying untrue.  You have yet to add any facts to your side of the argument.
Do you really realize just how STUPID you sound tonight on 60 minutes????  Maybe, just once, try actually ANSWERING the question you're being asked???  Or is that something you're just not capable of doing???
Do you realize how unprofessional Lesley Stahl was in her interview? Her bias was quite clear.
You mean by asking questions that were designed to expose @BetsyDeVosED ‘s ignorance & incompetence through her very own answers? Okay.
LOL, yes, by confronting Betsy DeVos with FACTS.  THAT really messed her up.....
I do not want my tax dollars going towards private schools.
I don't want my tax dollars going to public schools.
Why not, Jeff?
I don't agree with the anti-God curriculum.
I’m a former teacher and am unaware of an anti-God curriculum. Do you think public schools should push one religion?
They already do push an anti-God curriculum.
Alright, I’ll let it go. I can assure you that in the schools where I worked, there was no “anti-God” curriculum. Not sure why you think there is. Sounds like conspiracy theory, which can be very exciting when you think you’re on the “right side.” Have fun with that.
From 1950 to 2015, for every new student they enrolled, US public schools hired nearly four full-time staff, most of whom weren’t teachers. While schools hired teachers 2.5 times as fast as they added students, they hired more than 7 times as many non-teaching staff in that time.
Please please work on a voucher system where I don’t have to pay to support a failing public system AND pay for my kids to go to a great private insitution. That is taxation without representation @BetsyDeVosED
Everyone in my family is a product of public education.  And we all have been successful in our chosen professions
Cool.  And those parents can pay for that private school.  Nobody is taking that choice away
YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HELP THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD??!!!!! The FUNDING needed to have access to resources that will help them!  Another government snake killing our schools so they can profit.
No public funding for religious schools.
No public funding for secular schools!
Wtf is wrong with you?
From 1950 to 2015, for every new student they enrolled, US public schools hired nearly four full-time staff, most of whom weren’t teachers. While schools hired teachers 2.5 times as fast as they added students, they hired more than 7 times as many non-teaching staff in that time.
Where is your citation?
No parent should be faced with many bad choices like what you’ve done to the families of Detroit with your terrible charter school law in MI. You should be ashamed of what you and your family have done to the children of Detroit.

You know what would help? More funding for our schools. We are limited by what we can do, because our resources are constantly being taken away. Stop standardized testing these kids to death. Stop taking away arts education.
Stop pretending that school choice is the answer.
Yes !!! Proud of our twins stepping out today #never  Again !! Thank you ! Long Island , NY
Notice the lack of any reasoned response. The negative reaction from these irrational few is purely emotional. And these are the people teaching our children.
You don't even bother to visit and gain insight from low-performing schools. You don't know the performance of Michigan schools. Lady, you're worse than incompetent and you most certainly are derelict in your duties.
I’ll watch your 60 Minutes interview next time I accidentally swallow poison and need to throw up.
Leftists would shackle them to the desks rather than let kids escape their government indoctrination camps.
Finally an administration doing something about school shootings! Thanks @realDonaldTrump & @BetsyDeVosED
There is a reason you are so hated ~ and spewing your canned answers to real questions and challenges might go over big in the country clubs and your church but it will not work for our children. OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR EDUCATIONS ARE NOT FOR SALE!
And take more away from already underfunded public schools
You mean no “white” parent
I have to hand it to you. You are uneducated and clueless, and you don’t care. That takes courage.
#ShulkinMustGo
No secretary of education should ever spend their first year without visiting an underperforming school in your home state
Instead of walking away from public schools, get involved and improve it, people. We have the power to do that. Mrs DeVos isn’t asking for that kind of change.
So where are all these choices in rural areas when a parent is "settling"? Give parents tax breaks for homeschooling? Isn't that part of your plan as well?
We’re trapped and stuck with the worst Secretary of Education...#ResignDeVos
Maybe your brother can merc them up all Blackwater style. is that what you me!n?
When you don’t fund public schools how can they work for anyone?  You can’t siphon all the money away then say “look, they’re underperforming! I told you I was right!”
This would be great as long as public school in any place do not suffer the consequences.
Do you know what an IEP is?
We “settle” every day when learners as young as 3 are “housed” with 18-22 of their closest 3 yr. old friends.  EC education should mirror that which it replaces- the family.  Overworked teachers can not meet the needs of hoards of same-age learners.  Right, mom’s?
But perhaps don’t develop a policy focusing on just the few it doesn’t work for, genius. Oh wait, you achieved so much in life yourself.
I feel trapped by @BetsyDeVosED failure to support for public education.
Public education should serve the public interest, not private privilege.
As an educator I am deeply saddened and angry at the representation of our educational system. To honestly not fully understand how education operates much less understand how funding cuts will only harm the neediest of students is appalling!
The limitations on how public schools teach is placed by YOUR Department.
Shush
Parents shouldn't feel trapped or stuck with you being Sec of Education! You are grossly unqualified and unfit for this position! #Resign
Then create PUBLIC SCHOOLS to meet various needs.

Don't give education dollars to commercial or religious interests.  

No publicly financed madrasses - not Islamic, Jewish, Christian or  anything else.
Resign
Private schools are already an option. Don't like public schools? Go elsewhere, including home school. You're not changing anything, you're just selling it to corporate schools.

Plus. There's no viable benefit to leaving public schools. The education is the same... By law.
You know nothing about education.
Were you always this ignorant  or has it taken you years to achieve this level?
School choice isn’t a bad concept, but the way you want to operate it with tax dollars funding private Christian schools for already wealthy white families is not okay.
But no child should be left behind and there has to be a balance... So taking money from schools already doing bad to give it to a school that is doing much better is not right... It's not fair for the child that can't get to another school and doesn't have the choice.

It's your JOB to worry about the many and the individual.  By options, you should be talking about investing more in special needs programs and after school programs. But, you have no idea what you're doing.  So, I'm not surprised you don't understand that.  Please quit!
And your solution is taking money away from public schools
You are speaking in unrealistic absolutes!!! “NO PARENT SHOULD FEEL STUCK OR TRAPPED” implies that you desire for ALL parents to have options; however you don’t mean ALL, you mean “some”, leaving A LOT of families left behind!! GIVE US A PLAN...

What about rural schools. Choice is okay when you live in a city or suburb but when the closest school other than your local school is  an hour away or several schools in your area are failing... then what is our choice....move?? Please..Lets fix our public schools.
Also, I have a comment about your comment, "No parent should have to feel like they are settling..."

That's an interesting statement. That is considering, all of us public school teachers have had to settle for you. We will not stand quietly!!!
Help every public school becomes the BEST public school they can possibly be by FULLY FUNDING THEM!!! A Then I promise you, most schools 2ill work for most children.
Also,  you’re just focusing on a Michigan focus on all the other ducking schools.
Yea but not everyone can afford private schools like your rich self. If you want everyone to have a chance then YOU PAY for kids to go to private schools out of your own damn pocket. Someone who has little to no knowledge on how schools work shouldn’t be in your position.
leave our kids and grandkids alone go home and count your damn money
School choice as you have defined it only perpetuates inequality.
There are so many reasons to hate you; but my God, that awful nasaly Michigan accent is towards the top.
if public schools had the resources they need, there wouldn’t be any “settling”
Why not? We settled when we got our secretary of education!
If a kid's education "isn't working", there are many solutions:
-Hire a tutor
-Go to a different public school
-Go to a trade school
-Home school
-Private school (paid by the family)

This isn't the 1800s. There are many options. Publicly-funded private schools aren't the only 1.
Bravo!  Thank you!
@BetsyDeVosED is doing a marvelous job!

California voters wanted this 20 years ago!
They do have options, always have. But as a taxpayer, I pay for public schools, not private schools. Let those who want to attend private or religious schools foot the bill themselves like my parents did when they sent 5 kids to Catholic school. That's personal responsibility.
Well, no US Citizen should have to feel like they are settling when it comes to their reps in Govt. & yet we're stuck with you. #FireDeVos #Unfit #BuyAJobBetsy #Resign #SaveOurSchools
Even worse, no parent should ever feel trapped or stuck with such a clueless, incompetent person responsible for the policies that shape their kids’ education. You are THE WORST thing that could happen to education in the country.
What are you doing to help the public schools? They are tasked to educate all students from all backgrounds. Private and charter schools can pick and choose their students. Public schools cannot.
How would you know?   Answer that Secretary DeVos.
You are so full of crap. Why can't these "options" that you champion be available to EVERY child by additionally funding & expanding upon the current PUBLIC school system?  Hmmm??? 
It takes a village to raise a child.  Even though you’re denying it, every individual child is a part of a school community- school system. It’s like a perfect puzzle. Interdependency galore. Invest in PLCs and communities and watch what happens with a child. #SchoolBiome
Stop tweeting and resign.
Shouldn’t you “intentionally” have visited low-performing schools to find out why some students are trapped or stuck or why parents may feel like they are settling? How can you fix problems if you don’t know what they are???
You’re a racist who is creating a path for white students to get an education at an all white school! I’m shocked and surprised you didn’t wear your hood last night for your interview! Your grand wizard @realDonaldTrump should be pissed at you!
Why wouldn’t it work for certain students? Do research, get answers, and fix the problems! It’s a process! Your stupidity, ignorance, and lack of experience make you unqualified for the appointment you paid for!!!
I feel like I’m settling when it comes to my children’s SecretaryEducation. How can I get them a competent one? Please advise.
"No parent should have to feel like they are settling when it comes to their child’s education." Good points, Bets'. Likewise, our children shouldn't have to settle for a Secretary of Education that was handed the job based on money, not knowledge.
Nitwit alert!!  Secretary of Ignorance
You are like a bank manager standing at the back door, shoveling money into the truck of a venture capitalist while screaming at the patrons that the banking system is failing. You are failing it, and ensuring failure through redistribution. Resign now!
This is meaningless drivel. Work for what? What is the vision for public school? What exactly is being done other than cutting funds to achieve that vision? What specifically denotes a successful school?

You talk like public schools have no idea how to handle kids outside a certain learning ability. That is so far from the truth. You don't do justice to the teachers there. What I have seen in these schools are teachers very willing and able to do for each student. You're wrong.
Great public schools would work even better if you and your family weren't diverting tax funds for charter schools that only work for some.
You’re clueless.  Fix the public schools. That’s your job.
Schools should not be allowed to teach there r more than 2 genders and don't take religion away bc of a few that don't believe
Get a clue.  You wouldn't know how to teach, reach kids, support parents, develop engaging lessons, prepare materials, implement constantly changing curriculum, help motivate and foster....in other words, you are a clueless shell. #iteach
Oh my Lord! I watched your last two interviews. I actually believe that you may need to go back to school and learn how to answer a question properly. You are the epitome of a Trump appointee... Deficient! Sad!
You can’t focus on the few when the many are struggling. Focus on getting the basics to the schools and the teachers before condemning public schools.
What are options? You are using safe words for private pricey schools. Most people cannot afford
Choice is always been and always will be available for all.  No one is trapped, that is simply an excuse.  Public funds for private schools is an astonishingly poor idea.  Your ignorance is not bliss; please start doing your homework.
What about kids in rural America?  How can they possibly go to another school of choice if the only school that have nearby is already an hour drive by school bus?  Please explain...
You only advocate for private schools. Not trying to improve the public school system. Stop trying to make excuses for yet another terrible showing. #Unqualified
It's so annoying how you can never say anything positive about public schools.  Being in the position you are in, you need to fight for ALL students, not just take tax payer money for for profit organizations that YOU benefit from.
What's the number of days before you're no longer Secretary of Education?  @realDonaldTrump hates being embarrassed by his lackees.
I work in public education, meaning I work for ALL kids. PLEASE visit public schools and find out how you can help.
Then put your money where your mouth is and start a grant program with your billions.
US spends more per child than superior school systems around the world. Send the responsibility back to States. Stop forcing public school. It was always unconstitutional.
Just get the public schools out of the indoctrination business and back to providing an education.
Or, you should fix the damn problem
Choice is not the solution. It’s the problem.
Shouldn’t we focus on making ALL public schools great FIRST? Then if someone doesn’t want the GREAT public school in their neighborhood they can choose to go elsewhere?
In Detroit when will you start providing transportation to students who want to go to quality public schools. Not neighborhood charters.
Corporate schools aren’t a choice. Making profits off of children is not a choice. It’s disgusting how you present this lie of education to make a profit
What do you know of this. Have you ever attended a public school?  Have your kids?  Have you EVER taught a class? You are out of touch and unqualified.
Why not?  We’re stuck with you. Why don’t we have options to get rid of your sorry ass?
Is that how they can all end up as clueless and moronic as you???
It's your job to get all the public schools funded and level, not to push kids into private schools.
Raise your hand if you were a dowry for an amway inheritance #googleitillwait
So what are these options?
What's with PrivateSchools that Produce Great Intellects the Likes of You Donald Trump and George W Bush and Public Schools That Produced RhodeScholar Bill Clinton, Editor  HarvardLawReview Barack Obama? Perhaps Private/Charter Schools Academic Proficiency More Wishfull Than Real

Then they can pay for it.
Then out the money back into the schools instead of taking it out. Your lack of funding and real empathy has lead to this.
You're right. Please resign immediately so that so.done who knows how to help the schools can be in control. Kids will suffer under your "leadership."
You have shown that you clearly have no clue.
Quit perpetuating the erosion of the public school system!
This sounds like you want people to pull thier kids from public to private schools! Bet you could get involved with that, know anyone that could help you with that, i bet you do!
"No child should ever".....that's the plan?
Then why are working so hard to gut rules and services that help these people?
Parents should have option of being able to homeschool for personal or religious preferences, and be reimbursed for being forced to pay taxes into public schools systems they don't use or approve of.
It seems like parents have to settle for, and are stuck with, a morally bankrupt president and incompetent corrupt cabinet.
Pay for Play at its best.
The Swamp has come to education!
Resign!
Should a parent have to feel like they are settling when it comes to their child's education by having a useless person like you in charge of it? No. It's time for you to resign and put your money where your mouth is.
So instead of paying $81,000 per teacher for guns and training, invest in the education programs and equipment!!! Is that an option you will be giving teachers?? Buyout the gun option?
Once you suck the funding out of public education, those kids will truly be "stuck." Your kids attended private schools. The wealthy have that option. Yes, you pay property taxes for schools your kids don't go to but it's the price we pay to keep America strong.
just quit and go away - everyone knows you can not handle this job , i'm sure you know this to
Here's an option - make great public schools greater #MGPSG
You’re goal is to destroy public schools. How much money will your company make with ‘choice???’
Idea: distribute funds EQUALLY to public & charter schools & $0 to private.   taking funds from public schools!
You’re a disgrace!! RESIGN!!
You’re an old hag who is full of 
We all feel like we're settling (or worse) when it comes to you as our secretary of education.  ALL OF US.  You lack even basic knowledge of how our education system works.  Please resign.  That's the only way the kids get a fair shot.  (Bears in schools... WTF?)

If u knew anything about public ed.,you'd know that a child who's not doing well has many more choices in public rather than private or charter schools.AVID,SPED,IB,AP,gifted&remedial programs r available 2 all students.Teacher certification isn't even required in many charters.
Then I feel trapped and stick with you, so why don’t you just resign and fade out the public’s eye?! Mmk 
Speaking empty words, talking in circles, and using catch phrases will not change anything. Face it, you look down on the poor, you don't care about the education of impoverished children. You only care about your rich friends.
That's true, which is why there are magnet schools, which are held accountable to equity standards, unlike charters. The thing is, not everyone can drive their kids across town to go to a choice school. We need good PUBLIC schools and decent transportation systems to access.
You’re not even qualified to wake up in the morning. #resign
Parents who don't want #CommonCore or rebrands feel like we "settle" every single day. Bill Gates told Nat'l Gov Assoc what would happen when Ed standards, curriculum & testing aligned: a powerful market would emerge---it is a one size fits all market failure for kids 8 yr$ in.
My grandson tried to kill himself cause the school board here in Arlington, WA 98223 wont help him the school has been very abusive to him emotionally, physically and mentally abused him for the last 4 yrs Mr. Olson at KENT PRAIRIED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, ARLINGTON WAS HELP MY BOY
Miss Betsy pls help my boy here in Kent Prairie Elementary school, Arlington, WA who is suffering from emotional, physical and mental abuse caused by the principal Mr. Olson and the counselor Mary ? the school board wont do anything for me he tried to kill himself pls hellp
So that’s why you are tearing apart public education every chance you get? It’s not due to you making money with your for-profit education corporation?
You want public school dollars to subsidize private school tuition, so kids can go and learn that the earth is flat, evolution and climate change are mythical, and that an invisible old man living in the clouds hates gays and minorities. You’re pathetic.
Why are we stuck with you? Oh wait ..... $$$$$
Not a bad sentiment, but charter schools have failed miserably in your home state. That aside, the #60Minutes interview only further reinforced how outrageously and embarrassingly unqualified you are.
Omg woman. Go into a public school with broken desks, no heat, no paper or pencils, old books and no sage playgrounds for recess. How are their choices working out? Fund our public schools!!!
You're hated because you're an uppity rich woman who bought her fucking seat. You're a moron, a lunatic and don't know shit about schools. And this is coming from a PhD candidate. I needed to use words YOU can understand since you are well below the genius rating. Fucking resign!
gifted students, special needs students, or students with English as a second language. You are what happens when we allow money to cloud judgment. How congress can say you are fit for this position shows that partisanship is more important then our Country.
U INTENTIONALLY don't visit schools U think r beneath u. U have a Title. America don't respect U. U n ur brother bought ur title, but u can't by RESPECT. QUIT or do ur JOB u r unqualified 4.
Access to what options? In Pensacola Florida where a pilot study for vouchers was held, 80% of the private schools in the area would not accept a voucher. Moreover in your state of Milwaukee it was shown that Private Schools do not have programs to support (1/2)
Parents feel stuck and trapped with you!
Mrs. DeVos, why is that nightmare, Common Core still in place. Why are my kids still having 2 deal with that garbage? We voted 4 that C.C.  2B gone. Please end it now! I can say from having to deal with this, that Common Core DOES NOT help our kids! It only makes things harder.
You’re incompetent for so many appalling reasons
Stop pushing your lousy agenda. The facts don't back you up. You made a mess of Michigan and now you're ruining schools across the country.
#resign for the sake of our children please.  You literally make us look bad.
Do the right thing please, and let Trump put someone more qualified in your place.
Betsy resign please
Just quit, you're obviously not qualified for your position. Your greed will directly screw up young minds. How arrogant are you to pretend you know what you're doing? I hope one day you fly on an airplane where a business man shows up that day an call himself a pilot
@BetsyDeVosED, in many communities in the US choice has led to economic and racial segregation in schools. Your plans will only increase this divide and the school-to-prison pipeline. Do better.
We see right through your unintelligent bs. Nice try. You are a sham and a criminal. Servers at spectrum health much? Russia?
You have no effective vision on education, and no understanding. Resign
Did she even attend school?
you’re a joke, sweetie.
Yet you refuse to visit underperforming schools to better understand and assist them. You showed you incompetence on 60 minutes. You really have no business being in your position. Except of course to support a wannabe dictator. Receive a few bucks from the lobbyists like NRA
Unfit! Idiot! Resign Immediately!

Hahahah hahahahah yes options for rich people to remove their kids from wider society. Options is such a euphemism here Bets.
https://twitter.com/VanityFair/status/973262381714468864 …  DDeVos: Well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school, school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems. So let's defund public education? Wow - how ignorant.
One year after her painful confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos still has no idea what she‘s talking about http://vntyfr.com/JfNWcIU 
What an embarrassment you are, and such a slap in the face to the millions of families who rely on public schools for so much support beyond education, considering the dire economic state that greedy GOPers perpetuate. They will be removed from office. RESIGN.
You are unfit for office
Betsy #payforplay Devos.  Corruption and stupidity at its finest.
If you're a reflection of an "individual" who had choices, it seems then that you'd prefer actual education be optional. You seem to be the most uninformed, unintelligent huckster of "religious" education, aiming to impede US progress in education in favor of Christian zealotry.
You're a true moron. You are not an educator. You are unfit for your office which you bought from our illustrious #MoronInChief. #FireDeVos #FireDeVos #FireDeVos #FireDeVos #FireDeVos #FireDeVos
Please resign. You are unfit for the position you hold.
