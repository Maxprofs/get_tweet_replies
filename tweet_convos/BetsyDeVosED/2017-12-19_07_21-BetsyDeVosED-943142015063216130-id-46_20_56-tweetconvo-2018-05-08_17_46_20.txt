Knocked it out, cold. #rethinkcronyism #AlabamaSenateElection showed what your type of school system will yield, bigoted, small minded sheeple, with no morals, who worship their corporate masters like the Jews were expected to worship the Pharoh. Merry #resistmas you swampdweller
Hey, how much do I need to donate to the @SenateGOP to secure a high level position? I actually have education experience, too!
All the money you steal with a pyramid scheme
Here's a big idea, how about you and your brother get your sticky fingers out of Americans pockets.
Betsy you are not an advocate for public school children.ONLY for rich children.Stop lying.  I pray to the Lord you will not take away too much money from the public school. Many people cannot aford private school.
Yes, let's rethink education, let's get rid of common core already! Let's burn the common core books and delete the CC Standards! Enough already! Stop ruining our children with common core. States aren't stopping it. We need help.
Only 1 in 8 "Common Core" textbooks really are!! Focus on how to improve instead of rejecting.
No, I won't. See, Facebook is part of the problem. It increases exposure to Russian #Propaganda, and it's bad for #mentalhealth.
Furthermore, Facebook (and other social media platforms) is detrimental to strident educational outcomes. As Secretary of Education, you should already know this, Betsy.

Thanks for sharing this article
You're welcome! I try to provide evidence as often as I can, something this administration appears incapable of doing.

Suggestion: Offer inexpensive online college classes nationwide for under graduate classes with low cost test centers.  1. You will eliminate college debt for these students, 2. You will look like a champion for the poor, 3. You will remove the funds that propel the liberals

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …


Betsy DeVos will personally pocket more than $2 million from the tax bill while denying relief to defrauded students. Everything about this administration is insidious. https://twitter.com/cnn/status/944081581416898561 …
Right. Then force standardized tests to keep the schools opened. At what point does this make any sense.
Get educated on the issues.

Not only is @BetsyDeVosED not qualified to be Sec. of Education, she also awarded a student loan debt collection contract to a company she has a financial interest in. How is this not a conflict of interest? Our students deserve better. #CA39 #PhilForHouse …
Enjoy your TWO MILLION DOLLAR BONUS, you fraud. You don’t give a teacher’s damn about our kids or their/our futures.
Wondering what in your background qualifies you to discuss education. You have never taught, all you have ever done is  make money of schools. You may well be the least qualified cabinet official ever. Congrats- go back to producing broadway

Someone said Sleazy and you came to mind. Wow!
How about rethink the department of education, without DeVos....
You need to be questioned by the @FBI in regards to your brothers activitys in trying to secure a nuclear deal for Saudi's using Russian reactor technology paid for by the Trump campaigns promises of stopping Russian sanctions. #MuellerTime
BETSY ONLY HELPS WHITE RICH KIDS! EVEN ONE STUDENT SAID U WERE @ HIS SISTER'S GRADUATION & U MADE A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF! STUDENTS WANT TO GO MARCH @ YOUR HOME NOW & WANT ANSWERS!

Register to vote. Get two friends registered to vote. Throw a voter registration party. 

At the end of the day, this administration is bad for you, it’s bad for us,…
I’d rather be struck by lightning than listen to that dumbass talk

#California Watchdog Taking On The Teachers Unions' Political Agenda

Teachers should not fear to speak out, but they do in CA. 
California kids can't go to school unless they are injected with Bill Gates Guinea Pig Vaccines. Something needs done NOW!!
Between Communist Core & Mandatory Vaccines, school attendance has dropped dramatically in COMMIFORNIA. 
TAX BILL#HOMESCHOOL
How do Californians feel about SB277
743 Came to that hearing AGAINST MANDATORY VACCINES, incl Doctors
53 wanted Mandatory Vaccines…
#ChartersWork? The @NAACP backs up its call for a moratorium on charter schools with something often missing in today's political environment - #facts.

Fuck you, Betsy.
Brilliant idea: Schedule around educator availability. Avoid one sided conversation.
