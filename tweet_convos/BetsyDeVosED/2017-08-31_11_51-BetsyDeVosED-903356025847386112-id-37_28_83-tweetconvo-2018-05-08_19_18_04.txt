Pay-for-play "Secretary" who costs taxpayers $8 million for her endless photo ops. She wouldn't last a day working in the real world.
What do businessmen have to offer education? How are they remotely relevant?
NONE. Business Leaders and politicians are why our education system is so screwed up now. They're clueless on education
Creative ideas brewing are welcomed! Please kindly view, and reply to positive vision proposal emailed @usedgov  -- http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal/ …
I pray & certainly expect we would bring in some spiritual guidance in the failed education system.The end product is seen in streets 2day
Nah. Public school classrooms are no place for religion.
Character building, Respect, Good Morals, Discipline, Love for others are all necessary traits for a civilized society, not liberals agendas
Those are things that should be taught.....at home.....by parents.
Assuming all the parents had been taught in order to teach.People must be taught right frm wrong or you have what you have,GovParentalRights
What do business leaders have to do with education other than provide funding so that they are able to push their own personal agenda?
Where are the education leaders?
You have terrible ideas. Schools should not be for profit. They should be for education. Not for you or your friends pocket books.
Statstically 1-2 of the women you are standing with were raped and you just repealed legislation that protects them.
Social Engineering in our schools MUST STOP! Teachers Punishing Students4 GOP Beliefs Must be FIRED! Tick-Tock  @BetsyDeVosED #DrainTheSwamp
Business leaders? Why not teachers? Business leaders have no clue about teachers and public schools. You've got it all wrong Betsy DeFraud.
Gross.
Too bad there are no professional educators to talk to about education needs. Oh wait...
Devos should be meeting with school officials both private AND PUBLIC! Anything else is a waste of time!
They give you some stock tips to get even richer?
Because business leaders know so much more about educating children than educators. NOT.
She's a dumb witch ...another photo op

Education is not a "business" and this party missed having educators in the mix. Here is an "idea": quit and go back to just being rich.
How much they all #paytoplay for that photo op?
Did they demand to know how much she paid for her position? Why she even wanted it in the first place?
So u all can dismantle our education system & give charter contracts 2 her billionaire friends?
Yes. Any adult that takes their picture with @BetsyDeVosED cannot be trusted.
Why should business leaders be involved in decision-making about school?!?
Many sour faces in that picture; they have @BetsyDeVosED figured out.

#WhatTheyToldBetsy
That explains her befuddled look. Wait-that's her normal expression.
Please let me know if you have similar meetings with educators! We have a plethora of ideas about our industry and would love to share.
