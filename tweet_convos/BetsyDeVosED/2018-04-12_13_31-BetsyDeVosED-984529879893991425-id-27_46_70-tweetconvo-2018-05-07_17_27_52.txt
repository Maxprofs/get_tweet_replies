Betsy is not qualified to discuss any of those topics!  Has she even visited a public school yet?
And of course you are.
Well I've worked in public schools for 20 years so yes, I actually believe I have an advantage over Betsy "I bought my Secretary of Ed position" DeVos.  Don't be so snarky - it pisses jesus off
Oh I’m sorry! So you are one of those pushing the socialism agenda. I’ll be praying! 
LoL #PeopleOfTheInternet
Yeah, I would think a man with the handle ‘ Grandmommy might be more progressive!
More money to public education. Privatizing it and deregulating it will only leave us further behind other countries than we are now.
Start w teachers - screen for the right temperament. We don’t need bullies teaching. Get rid of common core/new math. Put critical thinking back into classes. Smaller class size - no illegals. Put vocational programs BACK, yes BACK into HS.
Greater risk from bad to worst if continue down the same path of lack of training a child in the right way to go & when he/she matures he/she will not depart. Lack of character moral values destroys a culture. Must turn a culture of hate to a culture of Love & with it comes Peace
I’d rather eat shards of glass. I’d rather lick the inside of a dumpster. I’d rather have bamboo shoots shoved under my nails. I’d pretty much rather do anything than watch @BetsyDeVos say or do any damned thing other than #resign
Devos did a respectable job of breaking the education system in Michigan.
I cannot think of this woman (@BetsyDeVosED) without becoming irate.
Her appointment was a favor granted her and an insult to every #Student (barring Christian #Homeschoolers — those going through #SchoolSystem programs don’t count to her) — in the #US and #USTerritories.
#VOTER
DeVos , as former School owner, often GOP voter and fan of free markets, I am aghast at your policies that benefit the worst for profit schools and allows rapacious owners feast on ignorant students. I believe in level playing field. This is just sending students to ruin.
More blather from the devangelical fascist queen of the christaliban.
One parent, or guardian must accompany the child to school every day.
No one believes in Betsy Devos!
Rethink? Get rid of common core! Get rid od standardized test!! Start with that Betsy!
Common Core repeal actually improves it!!! The problem is Local control turns improving ed into a chaotic mess. Need a smooth way to improve.
Dr Vos has as much chance improving education as I have of making a 24mi broad jump. Her appearances before Congress both before and after confirmation prove decidedly that she is inept and a trumpian drone.
This is education in the US.

@GOP @onetoughnerd Gov. Snyder appointed Evangelical @BetsyDeVosED head of Detroit Schools. DeVos discovered Evangelical Charter Schools did HORRIFICALLY on standardized tests. Did she give them extra money for resources,recruit better teachers. NO, SHE EXEMPTED THEM FROM TESTING

Talk about the blind leading the shill.
Part of DeVos's plan to dismantle public education, is to foster school shootings by funding the politicians who protect the NRA.
Discuss and rethink is a poor substitute for a sound strategy and action. Go back to private life and leave public education to people with experience.
Lemme guess: more Jesus, less science?

Rethink education is betsy wetsy speak for charter schools
When is that stupid b**** going to resign?
No, thank you.
