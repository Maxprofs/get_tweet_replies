the face of a woman who has never worked a day in her life; lives off daddy, buys her job, brother kills 4 a lvng ; let me guess? christian?
whats it like to live off daddy & purchase a position?  u do it with heels & a short skirt on @BetsyDeVosED #govwhore 
ever work a day bets?
What will she do?


#SignsYoureABadPresident When you pick this moron to your cabinet.

Can't you get her to petition the Fed to print more illusions to support education? She could help PR by making her response mean something!
Public education killer
¿@SecEducacionPR, cómo se siente ser tan incompetente y malcriada?

Thank u 4 speaking #truth Madam Sec. It’s never failed 2 trigger crazy left #haters. 
You are truly delusional if you think BD has a clue.
Thanks to Betsy DeVos, future American students won't even be able to find Puerto Rico on a map.
So much hate here .. Bunch of Debbie Downers.. Are u that miserable with ur life ?? #commoncore has 2 go school choice=good Pledge mandatory
@LibsRLame no, we're not miserable with our lives, we know the truth & the truth is that Betdy here doesn't care for our education system
Our education system has sucked for a long time . No child left behind , remember that? Common core sucks 
What are u talking about ?
Mam, do you know what YOU are talking about? Betsy thinks guns in schools are appropriate in case there are bears. That's pretty psychotic.
Well like it or not she’s the Sec of Ed I don’t care for her but she needs to do something!
Too much tweeting, not enough working!
Betsy is proof that MONEY can buy a job but MONEY can't buy intelligence and class.  INCOMPETENT AND CLUELESS
Nice blurry pic of a woman everyone hates
Her Boss @realDonaldTrump called Hispanic Catholics "LAZY" for expecting help from US,funnels billions to @TexasGOP @SenTedCruz Evangelicals

Why not do you [ #USA & #EU ] decide to propose an education law that includes "SOS: firearm injuries” ¿?

“Calling to express her support”? What is she actually doing about it?

The new tax bill would tax tuition waivers for graduate students, many of whom subsist on cat food  http://www.chronicle.com/article/Republican-Tax-Proposal-Gets/241662 …
Just not for handicapped kids! This WOMAN IS UNFIT FOR THIS JOB!
She doesn't care about your students or any others.
This woman just cut funding for children! She is disqualified disgusting human with a crazed agenda. She must be stopped not thanked!
When their are unilateral improvements in education for all students everywhere I'll be the first in line to applaud.
Notice her "expression" vs actual support. The laws she's passing are discriminatory to the poor, POC & the SpEd students. Calls are free.
You are ruining American education. Siding with corporations and profiting off poor students? You people are morally bankrupt.
The face of disenfranchising Americans.
She needs to resign
You care about the schools of Puerto Rico as much as you do for any of our educational system. That is to say not at all. Please resign and let us other educational professionals that know what we’re doing try to fix what you’ve done.
That's what she gets paid 2 do. I think she's also paid 2 make policy that strengthens our PSs, using our tax $$$. She's much better @ calls
I hope they all know about the difference between education & propaganda; Edward Bernays. The Century of the Self is nice for beginners.
Another greedy, soulless know nothing political asshole who is sucking America DRY. That would be DeVos.
Is the pro scam artist @BetsyDeVosED working on building shady for profit colleges to pad her bank account?

DeVos needs to stop traveling and instead do something to put a stop to all the transgender/gay/binary policies schools are implementing.

How much does it cost total in dollars to educate a Mexican citizen from  kindergarten to grade 12 $$$ do you have those figures?
Yep thanks for nothing Betsy. A phone call. Great. 3 weeks after #Maria, only around 10% of schools in #PuertoRico have opened again.
Please re-introduce George Orwell's "Animal Farm" & 1984 into the school reading curriculum. As the assault on liberty continues kids need 
Don't thank this monster. She is a soulless bigot who's greatest contribution will be fertilizing the ground when she dies
#FlunkDeVos
So true ...
All schools on PR are still closed and what are Betsy doing about it? Not a damn thing. Such a hateful and vile woman
Lady you need to be fired
These words are hollow, since she is actively working against public school funding and teachers unions.
BIG of her to pick up a phone.  Careful... she'll sell your schools to the highest bidder. No vouchers unless only accepted as full pmt.
Betsy thinks teachers are paid too much money while she wears a necklace that costs more than a teachers yearly salary.
And
The way the #TrumpAdministration works, soon you'll be describing #SchoolLunchIn4Words as:

"eliminated by Betsy DeVos"

Let them eat cake.
@BetsyDeVosED  is She under the same order, don't respond for any reason, sfcc wants me dead, buried!?  Please Respond.
What? Betsy the scam artist trying to figure out how to open a for-profit school on PR now?
I'd like to know why "teaching methods," which are really anti-American indoctrination, such as this are allowed?
Parents upset by multiple choice answer: 'shooting at @realDonaldTrump' 

Stop this stupid s**t teachers!
…
@LJChiov you're confusing American with Trump & you're forgetting that @BetsyDeVosED supports the use of guns in schools in case of bears
I have no confusion whereas U plainly are. The anti-Americans R leftist socialist/commies who want children sitting ducks in gun free zones

you do know that she never went to or taught at a public school and is just a billionaire in the swamp
End Common Core
Mrs. De Vos, can you please visit Los Angeles Unified School District? They always say there is no funds. They should be investigated

@realDonaldTrump, your moron boss, could land us in a nuclear conflict, because he badmouthed a N. Korean dictator at the UN & on @twitter!!
By the way Ms. DeVos, @realDonaldTrump the moron hired you.
Julia no solo una llamada protocolar de Betsy es buena. Que identifique fondos para ayudar a reconstruir nuestras escuelas.
Finally figured out how she got hired.
She is intelligenter than the rest of us, though..... #ignorantgit
@BetsyDeVosED  A call  hahaha lol.  a call.  Don't believe a thing she says
Probably why you aren’t getting help....
So true:
DeVos Defends Trump by Saying: 'Would a Moron Hire Me?'

I think she just answered the question and insulted herself all at once.
She will go down quickly when DT is impeached.
How is her verbal support going to restore electricity. ?
LOL SHES PATHETIC
Now show it and send them some money!
#BetsyDeVos #BetsyMustGo @BetsyDeVosED is the second biggest Swamp Monster out there. #DrainTheSwamp #BetsyNeedsToGoNow
Yeah well if you believed that then I'm sure she has a bridge she'd like to unload as well
Her job is to destroy Education, she's doing a great job!
It was never perfect. Never will be. Where have you been ?
Agreed it was not great at all. But she is taking away grants, trying to dismantle unions. And eliminate all public school = destroy system
Does not matter what one does , someone or many will  always be unhappy. As I said, system will never be fix
Well my bot friend that's not what you said. And I don't share your pessimistic attitude. Say hi to Russia.
Betsy DeVos-Moran who works for Moran In Chief.  Pay to play and buy a seat!

@BetsyDeVosED Betsy has no I.D.E.A about F.A.P.E
If it's anything like the support she gives public schools then you are in big trouble.
She had to call for public relations sake. She really doesn't care. Cold-hearted monster.
Nothing to thank her for, she is turning millions of college students into indentured servants.
Nice! Thoughts and prayers for y'all!

Would a moron hire Betsy? He would and he did!
Thanks to @BetsyDeVosED for helping to demonstrate just whan an effing moron tRump really is. @realDonaldTrump
She called, she didn't say she'd help. 'Cause, you know, the people of PR aren't white Christians.
Or rich.
oh please she is rape loving scam artist
What does that have to do with the crisis that's happening in PR now?! Stop drinking the trump coolaid!
Julia, if you haven't already hired battalions of Marxist FEMINISTS as teachers, don't.  Your kid's education will drop to all new lows.
She’s a pathetic joke, an insult to hard working educators everywhere.
#CruellaDeVos' moves are all for PR effect or towards defunding #PublicSchools4America. It's easy to "support" & pray. It's hard to serve.
Americans will not forget the months their counting down this   Admin departure. One for the history books. PR that!
Were you told to praise her in order to get funds for rebuilding schools? Don't let her near your schools; she'll privatize them all.
Trump donates $100K to Dept of Ed. Only $9,199,900,000 to go to make up for his $9.2B in proposed education cuts.
of course so he can start up his propaganda - his money is not clean or neutral
DeVos wrongly interpreted the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter & met w/a group that published photos & info on survivors.

Resign @BetsyDeVosED
Canada luuuuuvs her too!
hates her you mean omg she is nasty - Toronto teachers refused to talk to her bc she is an idiot
She's the worst.
Keep her away from our education system. We don't want her dirty money. Her support is empty.
¿Expresarlo? ¿Cómo lo demostrará?
She’s a witch
Thanks 
Some private schools need a lot of help too from Washington - so students can continue classes
