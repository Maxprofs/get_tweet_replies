I sure hope none of them have disabilities, because that'd be ironic.
@BetsyDeVosED Did you bring a gun to fight those Grizzlies
In the meantime Corinthian students still have millions in debt for worthless degrees, do the right thing!!!
DeVos a paid puppet to privatized public schools...that isn't a win!

Did you apologize to the students after and tell them that @BetsyDeVosED has a vested interest in destroying public education?
Another taxpayer funded photo op for a woman who hasn't spent a day in a classroom actually working. She is disgusting.
She has supported and funded charter schools as an alternative. What’s wrong with that? What is wrong with you? Why are you so hostile?
Hostile? I'm an educator. I have more experience than DeVos. She donated money to fight against charter accountability in MI. Disastrous.
Okay, so go and make your case. Not be hostile towards her. That’s not helping anyone. If anything, it’s hurting you and your side.
I've clearly made my case. How have I been hostile? You know what's hostile? Rescinding 72 guidelines protecting students with disabilities.
That are federally required. If a school wants to have said guidelines, they can and probably will adopt it.
That's not how federal disability law works. Do you know what an IEP is? FAPE? Do you know anything about education at all?
I’m telling you, these policies can be adopted by state DOE’s and municipal governments. Hell, colleges can continue to enforce these rules.
Why not do you [ #USA & #EU ] decide to propose an education law that includes "SOS: firearm injuries” ¿?

We thought defying the law was her mandate from Trump http://ow.ly/Zc0q30gO6Yn 
Are You Brave enough to introduce GOOD MORAL teachings in our schools ? Are you brave to save our Children's Future?

Ruining one school at a time

You rolled back protections for transgender students, sexual assault victims, & kids with disabilities. You only do more harm.
Why would you let her into your school? Did you hear what she did to schools in MI?
Please speak out regarding oppression by hijab/burqas in public schools.
kakistocracy def: a system of government which is run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens.
DeVos is a monster and an advocate of harming disabled students. When this is all done may she live in mortal terror of parents but not long
Any school willing to host @BetsyDeVosED cares nothing about its students.  You are disgraceful.
those poor students don't know you hate them and taking away things to protect them.
And then she rushed to make sure that those students lose any rights they have under law.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinds 72 guidance documents outlining rights for students with disabilities http://trib.in/2yZZBYj  
She is one I wish cancer on. Painful, debilitating incurable cancer that takes her out slowly. She targets our most vulnerable children.
So were any of these kids special needs? If so do they know that you took away the guidelines outlining their rights? You are the worst thing to happen to education ever please do us a favor before you completely destroy it resign.
Are we still teaching the myths about addiction, Sisyphus, 911? Milt Friedman advocated for a negative income tax 
Oh! Were those the Grizzlies you were talking about at the confirmation hearing? They don’t look dangerous to me.
Let’s hope one of her policies isn’t to hand out NRA sponsored guns to all students
Universities refuse to reform policies on sexual assault. There is hope. Hold on to it. Keep fighting.

DeVos Defends Trump by Saying: 'Would a Moron Hire Me?'

I think she just answered the question and insulted herself all at once...
So proud to know these kids. Blessed.
well...at least she found a school full of Grizzlies...was she armed?

@davetg @laflynt @VickiRodrigue11 @VoteYourJob @coachmufasa2806
Betsy, u are unqualified for this job and got $ off of scamming poor folks trying to get ahead.  Also,your brother should be in jail.

#quit
#FlunkDeVos
Grizzlies? You cannot be fucking serious.
I just got that. Fucking unbearable.
Little do they know that you're actually terrible for the education system itself.
It’s too bad she never paused to get any experience in education. Nor paused to consider selling out our kids for big bucks is evil.
Thank you Secretary DeVos.
Disgusting.
Did you think there would be a real grizzly?!

#DumpDeVos
Thank you, Betsy, for shining a light on the reform our education system needs.
Did you ask how many are union? Bet it was 90% or better!
Please don't shoot the grizzlies.
God bless Betsy and God Bless our Youth!
