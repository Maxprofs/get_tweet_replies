Was this before or after she rescinded 72 policy guidelines that were to protect our children with disabilities?
Did you read the recinded guidance letters? Which ones do you feel should have stayed and why?
DeVos wants schools that don't have to be "burdened" by federal disability rights laws & protections for students w disabilities.
Gag me with a spoon! @BetsyDdid not convene a Parent Roundtable! She met with the big shot/no action Fluffs of LD!
I'm a parent. I was there.
Great for KY kids that you attended roundtable. Do you happen to know if @BetsyDeVosED held similar mtgs w/diverse parent groups as well?
Yes, the Secretary met with parents of Autism. https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-education-betsy-devos-convenes-parent-roundtable-special-education-during-autism-awareness-month …
Sorry Phyllis, she’s all talk and no substance.
Anyone who tries to spin this as a negative, is no champion of students with disabilities.
I'm pretty sure that you don't actually understand what she's doing. But don't worry, we will save you from yourselves.
Teach @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Where Toyota makes their cars!! He might need a map!!the Toyota manufacturing plants in the United States
OSEP needs 2fix the SLD debacle created through final IDEA rule promulgation in 2006 &restore fidelity 2 evaluating kids 4 SLD! #50StatesSLD
under Secretary Duncan who would never convene a parent Roundtable
Under Arne Duncan I was at the White House twice as a parent leader w/NCLD and met with Michael Yudin, Melody Musgrove & Ruth Ryder!
under NCLDS Organizing &did you meet with DUNCAN? Did parents have their own meetings w/Duncan not organized by a large NPO
Who organized THIS one? It was posted on FB these women were hand picked, asked in secret, and if they told meeting would be canceled.
Isn’t that transparency and democracy at its finest! @BetsyDeVosED is the worst education secretary money could buy!
So you roundtabled? What’s the plan? I’m paying $40 an hour for my child’s dyslexic instruction after school. Her tutor is next door to class

#DeVosResign

Betsy, just quit already.. Remember, history records everything and you already have plenty to be ashamed of. Limit the personal damage?
Noooo...please don't go!! Pray through this valley!!!
Was this before or after she cut $ to sped programs?
RESIGN ALREADY!
Where are the parents and/or teachers of color?
Exactly @krista_bolen - this sample size does not represent our population.
So..very..white
I saw that too but I also thought be nice to have a male in the crowd…
Right
How come @BetsyDeVosED is so fast to destroy programs/funding for students w/ disabilities?
Because she is a selfish sociopath like every other Conservative. Conservative means to conserve everything they can for themselves only.
True, Stephen. People like @BetsyDeVosED only care about themselves. True case of 'Hurray for me & screw you.'.
People.  Vote the vermin of the Hill in 2018. Next stop 2020. If Wake County School Board of North Carolina can get rid of the Koch brother fleas from their school board by voting, we can rid ourselves of this monstrosity of a false 'educator'.
Smiley pics won't save your job. #CruellaDeVos must go! #PublicSchools4America & students of all ages will benefit from her departure.
You are in waaaaay over your head. Resign before you make a fool of yourself.
Moral Campus is Missing from 1/2 of Our Children, who will teach us morals ? Parents Missing, Bible Missing, WHO WILL TEACH GOOD MORALS ?
@BetsyDeVosED is an unqualified bigot who bought this position and is actively harming students with disabilities. She's shameful.

I would not be so cute and retweet Tweets from groups advocating for students with disabilities, then turn around and repeal guidelines governing special education and rehabilitative services WITHOUT ANNOUCING IT TO A BROAD AUDIENCE.

Resign!
#Resign  You are unqualified and you've done enough damage to our public schools.  Go back to Michigan and volunteer at a Christian school if you want to feel useful.
Pay attention. Sooner or later there will be other than vetted groups of #WhitePrivilege demanding meeting with teeth no photo-op
What’s taking you so long to resign Betsy?
Her mentor, @POTUS, makes fun of people with disabilities. I'm sure she does, too, behind closed doors.
#RESIGN
The table does not look round to me.
Are you still here? America is so excited with news of your imminent resignation. Sooner than later, please! Buh-bye Betsy!
After rescinding guidelines for dealing with this kids and their parents!!! SHAME ON YOU. Parent of dyslexic son & educator here... RESIGN.
As the walls cave in on the Donald Trump administration, Betsy DeVos prepares her resignation
do us all a favor, and resign today. We heard the rumors that you are going to resign. Do it now. No need to wait.

As somebody who has dyslexia it’s wonderful to see this getting national attention
And our taxpayers should go to 275 student charter schools that pay CEO salaries? Puhleeze. No.
http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/amp/Small-Houston-charter-school-pays-top-dollar-to-12332395.php …
RESIGN NOW

Hope the door hits you on the way out. #grosslyunqualified
Is it true that you’re going to quit? I hope so, you are horrible and so unqualified for this job.
If this is true, hallelujah.

Why not do you [ #USA & #EU ] decide to propose an education law that includes "SOS: firearm injuries” ¿?

https://vivlium.com/documento-sos-people-with-firearm-injuries/4787/ … [ $14- ]
After you took away guidelines that were used to protect my child with autism....you pose for a photo op.  http://Shame.On.You .
You realize charter schools aren't obligated to support students with needs.  How can you even look anyone at the table in the eyes?
Agreed. I don't know how this woman sleeps at night. America's children deserve better!
Look how small you are. Literally and figuratively.
You know what's also helpful? Sex education. It's a drag when teens are hospitalized with STDs and don't have a clue. And their mommy prays.
So very pretentious and disingenuous. Did you tell them you rescinded 72 guidance documents outlining the rights for disabled students.
Another BS photo op for #BuyAJobBetsy #Resign

DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM YET!!!?
Dyslexia isn’t a Learning Disability. It’s just a different way of understanding. Different doesn’t = disability.  @DyslexiaBarton
I both agree and disagree with this on different reasons.  Shouldn't always be seen as disability, but it has many of the same concerns.
In my case, it made reading comprehension much more difficult, hence a disability (though I didn't know I was dyslexic until college).
Yet, my math and science abilities were off the charts.  

I think it is more a special needs idea than disability, but how to address it?

It’s time to go Betsy you gave it a try and like we all knew would happen you failed
Well, that's mighty fucking white of her. Where are the POC? Do their children not matter?
@realDonaldTrump Please let it be true that @BetsyDeVosED  is resigning. She has done nothing for public schools#StopCommonCore
GET TO WORK FOR MY KIDS!!
WHAT R U DOING ABOUT THIS?!!
DeVos, gather your things and make haste for the door. Show some intelligence and recognize your ineptitude. Leave our students alone.
You've locked up the dads? So just white women are the only parents that count? Typical.
You are a monster that truly does not care about children. you need to step down!
She has no idea what's she's doing and she's ruining the future for children #maga
We r around 23rd-26th in the world’s Educ Sys. So why r we not looking @ #1-3 in world & implementing those here? Does anyone even care? 
Get Soros’$ out of our state level school board admins! American students deserve better!
Step down you are unqualified
Everyone hates everything you do
Rather than spend the $ on fanciful parent/secretary conferences like this, y not spend it to benefit the children of ur rescinded policies?
Come on.  This bottom feeder shared the same womb as the guy from Blackwater.  You need to ask?

You are the worst thing to happen to education.
The bitch BOUGHT her position.
Were those mothers happy about you cutting  funding for children? Stick to your amway, leave the position for someone with knowledge/empathy
U screw w/disabled students, U undue protections those RAPED on campus worked R asses of 4 and u complain u were “undercoached?” #grizzlies
You have been voted the least productive secretary of ed. ever! At least you weren't more productive! Public schools would be in shambles!

#Resign Betsy!
You suck at this. You are under prepared, under qualified, under educated, and Underdog's Polly Purebred.  Go away!
She needs to go . Most ineffective person ever to hold that job. Another trump loser.
Did Betsy explain why she wants to cut funding for special ed?
you weren't undercoached for your confirmation hearing, you are just completely unqualified and a total incompetent. No wonder Americans hate your guts to the point where you are the most unpopular cabinet member.  You SUCK as Sec of Ed.
Ma'am you are clearly unqualified for your position. In all fairness resign. You are harming children and their education.
@betsydevosed Upper Arlington OH Schools get F on state ODE scorecard. 2nd year w F Failing kids w disabilities. Need teachers not new bldgs
And yet destroying healthcare and Medicare will cut valuable services to these children who need it. You call yourself a Christian????
Growth and proficiency! Know the difference now you ignorant Sec Of Ed! Most unqualified person ever for that position! @IvankaTrump
Resign! Giving money to GOP is not a job qualification! You are incompetent as Sec of Ed! @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @SenJohnMcCain
RESIGN! YOU ARE INCOMPETANT IN YOUR CURRENT POSITION! @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump
I hear you are on the way out, couldn't happen too soon. You have no desire to better public education.
You have not accomplished one thing.  You your and hold round tables.  Our children and schools deserve more.  Resign now.

You are most most inept and incompetent clown in Lord Dampnut's posse.  You bought the position for which you have no talent.
I hear you may be thinking about stepping down from your paid for perch.  When should we expect the good news?
Didn't she take away rights & protections for THOSE W/DISABILITIES?!  BETSY IS TRASH! AN OPPORTUNIST WHO PAID MILLIONS FOR HER JOB! #LOSER
When they're right, they're right!  Ta ta, darling!  

Buh-bye!
Like all Trump appointee-grifters, it just gets better and better...
Make it a mandate that schools teach kids about credit scores, borrowing, saving, and retirement in 6th -12th grades for REAL LIFE.
If Betsy needed to be coached  on the basics she is not qualified for the job! SAD
I hope you are addressing the disparity among SpEd services among states. Don’t add to the problem!

Where da black women at?

She is the exact opposite of Ms. Frizzle. How dare she.

UGH 
Really? When did you ever advocate for students with disabilities????
When will Betsy De Voss defund schools that teach anti white, anti American values, sensor, fire and denigrate conservative professors????
"BLACKWATER RAISES DEEPLY DISTURBING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE AMERICA IS BEING LED BY THIS NEW BREED OF FREE-MARKET MERCENARIES" @BetsyDeVosED

Every department is DESTROYING the regulations designed to protect the vulnerable, the poor, the disabled, the sick. #Reprehensible 
There's never been a more uninformed person on education than Betsy DoucheBag Has she ever gone to a school where they didn't protest her?
And took away the 72 guidelines for the IDEA. Hypocrite.  Worst cabinet member.  Worst person.  God have mercy on you. You aren't Christian.
Betsy " coz I'm rich! " De Vos
betsy is smiling because she'll make money off this as soon as she gets a new law tailor made for her.  "cuz she owns the gub'ment!
I see know women of color in that room

DeVos rescinds 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students
the kids have no hope with Devos.
You're an awful, awful person Betsy.
Betsy, who thinks teachers are paid too much, is wearing a suit that costs more than the yearly salary of the average teacher.
Why would you rescind a total of 72 whopping guidance documents thru the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services earlier?!
You want Vouchers, charters, private options, fine! But Don't discriminate against these kids because that's what you are doing!
Let's talk about how when voucher money is taken from public schools it hurts these children with no other options
How and why she sucks so much...
@BetsyDeVosED is a disease!

Dear @BetsyDeVosED,Please view and reply to: http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal … Emailed @usedgov 
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse please assist - thanks! 
Gawd she is awfulness!
betsy devos does not care for our nation's most vulnerable children. as a billionaire, she only cares for more $$$$$
Dollar bill is the only thing the Republicans know how to suck on.
I’m confused... is it only white people who know about Learning Disabilities.  Really?
What isn’t confusing is that @BetsyDeVosED sucks.
Because, obviously, no POC has a special needs child.
Or is it that Betsy is too scared of POC asking hard questions and demanding answers?

This is laughable. Celebrate students with disabilities by ripping away ways to help them learn.  You're an embarrassment to humanity. Quit!

Would have loved to be a part of this discussion dyslexia
Get to work Betsy! Just seen your calendar & all the off days you give yourself...it’s disgraceful. You are the worst thing for education!
We don’t want her to work. Then she might actually accomplish one of her sick goals.
I definitely see your logic! I agree! She needs to just go home...
I need sunglasses--so much whiteness!
Bigoted racist lying ZEALOT bought seat religious rich *itch. No cares about handicapped children. All LIES from ano MORON in tRumpland!
...and those are her good points!
Was this taken before or after she cut protections for students with disabilities?
Ask her how many truly dyslexic and disabled kids go to her school w jets donated by evil Blackwater??  Whaddaya think??
She is only interested in rich white Christian students. She’s taking notes on how to keep special needs kids out of charter schools.
you sit with them while this is happening??
Let's talk about how charters and private schools aren't required to accommodate these students but can still receive voucher money.
TY @ED_Sped_Rehab @BetsyDeVosED for including & listening to parent voice from Decoding Dyslexia! #SayDyslexia @EducateIN @suptdrmccormick
Not just all white but all women. Come on! Do better.
TY for engaging parents & educators @ED_Sped_Rehab @BetsyDeVosED in discussions about #dyslexia in education
@EducateIN @suptdrmccormick
@BetsyDeVosED does not care about kids! She cares about herself and her wealthy donors and ruining the state of education in this country.
She likes a good photo op.
#Parents no 1 seems 2 really care. #Listen 2 some while silencing the many? Do all kids a favor #RestoreFERPA https://wp.me/P4qgkb-5O 
LDA represents the 1 in 5 children w/learning disabilities including not only dyslexia but dysgraphia, dyscalculia, & processing disorders.
Too bad we have a clown dealing with serious issues.
The diversity of this group is staggering...
And immediately tells them if they want special education they will have to pay for it
How is it *possible* to come up with such a white group of parents, given the demographics of our nation's schoolchildren?
That’s the demographic of Devos sycophants
No minorities have kids that are learning disabled?
In Betsy’s mind all minorities are learning disabled.
Unfortunately, You are probably  right on that one
That’s because she’s a monster.
All Republicans are after supporting and ushering in this disaster of a "president" upon our nation. Damn them all.
she does not care
Where are the non-white parents? Where are the dads? Why is there nothing except white suburban women?
Because that’s all Betsy feels comfortable around.
Everything
Looks like a representative group to me ... but representative of what?
Any organization willing to work with @BetsyDeVosED has no actual interest in helping children.  Shame on all who attended.
Apparently only white children have dyslexia and developmental issues. Sad!
#TrumpAdministrationSoWhite
See? There is *no* such thing as white or male privilege! Why do only white females have kids with learning disabilities. Checkmate, Libs!
LMAO! 
While I commend the meeting, why are the parents not more representative of the US student population?
Such diversity!
Thank you, Betsy DeVos!  Teachers need Structured Literacy training!Schools need early screening in Kindergarten. Illiteracy is preventable!
Betsy is a dolt.
Descartes should trump DeVos
How many ways will Betsy be undermining the education of these underserved students?

Great job ladies 
Thank you for listening to these ladies concerns about our kids who are struggling with dyslexia in public ed system!  #saydyslexia
Talk, talk, talk,  followed by.......didn’t hear anything? That’s because nothing is going to happen so long as @BetsyDeVosED is in charge.
Thank you so much, Ms DeVos, for speaking with Decoding Dyslexia.  Our kids only need proper instruction. #teachertraining
Since Trump took office and nominated the worst Ed Sec money could buy-no one is home at @Ed_Sped_Rehab and won’t be in this administration.
@BetsyDeVos Thank you for listening to stakeholders about the struggles facing children with dyslexia. Now help them.  #saydyslexia
