You are a special kind of dumb. The evil kind.
I question why you are the Secretary of Education. RESIGN!!
It's time we rethink who is in your position. #rethinktrump #makeamericathinkagain #maga
How about that paradigm shift include actually paying teachers a good salary, fulling funding classrooms so teachers don't have to buy basic supplies, and expanding arts and music programs (which have been scientifically proven to help children in all of their subjects)?
Because then the rich wouldn't be able to segregate the poor from the middle class, whom they distract by vilifying the poor as stupid, lazy parasites. A government of the people, by the people, for the people has been bought and paid for by lobbyists and Citizens United.
Smarter version of you, but otherwise knocked it out of the park
So did someone tell you what "paradigm," "paradigm shift," "fundamental," "reorientation," and "a fundamental reorientation" mean, or are you simply trying to make people think you're smart? Ain't gonna work, ladybug. The American people have your number, which is a big zero.
Paradigm shift is Stephen Covey speak from 1985.
Big time!  This whole administration is regurgitating the 1980's!
PLEASE question everything!  It is terrible what the public school administrators have done to "dumb-down" America's children for too many decades.  I am praying you will be BOLD Betsy!  Thank you and keep up the great work!!!!
Your use of an Em dash is Horrible—just like you
It’s time you rethink your position, a fundamental reorientation and go sell some Amway crap. You need to step down

You're a disgrace
Want to REALLY make a difference? Make this happen
We are doing this. Why don't you actually go to a classroom and see how things work? You know nothing about our schools. You only care about pushing parochial schools! Not your place. Become a nun if you're so worried about it
This is complete and utter BS. You can’t talk about a budget and “ensuring” every child gets fair and equal education until you completely overhaul district line and how money is allotted to each school.
Paradim shift...RESIGN NOW
Learn from other successes instead of trying to privatize education.  You are barking up the wrong tree and part and parcel with the rest of this administration on destroying America!
Your vague statements aren’t fooling anyone. You are completely incompetent.
She's worse than incompetent, she's actually detrimental to the education of American youth...honestly, your national educational average is embarrassingly bad for who you are and what you proclaim to be and she's utterly incompetent... SAD!
3. Question the fitness of the Secretary of Education. Is she just a shill for for-profit corporations? Does she really know anything about or have any experience of educational systems? Has she ever been to a struggling school?
It's apparent she struggled in school.
In other words, eliminate the public school system completely and give tax payer dollars to Christian Fundamantalist schools and religiously oriented home schooling.
@BetsyDeVosED  Rich lady, you have no idea where you're doing, and unless you're eaten up with ego, you know that. If you wanted the best for American students, you'd resign, go home, and bake cookies.  In short, go away--the current resident & his other rank choices with you.
Well you're not the one to do it. #unqualified
Your graphic’s misuse of a comma makes the sentence annoyingly incomplete—just like you.
Today would be a good day for @BetsyDeVosED to intentionally visit an underperforming school.
#SaturdayMorning
Leah, give us ONE example of an “idea” that you love. Just one.
I keep data at a HS. If done responsibly I'm for school choice. However, when parents enroll and withdraw their child in 5 to 7 different schools in 4 years time they are setting their child up for failure. In addition, more accountability of charter schools needs to be in place.
This is limiting my daughter #CommonCore
No it isn't. If your daughter is limited, it's likely genetics
You mean defund public education and funnel money into more charter schools like the ones that FAILED in Michigan???  #ResignBetsy

Finnish Lessons:  What Can the World Learn from Educational Change in Finland? By Sahlberg.  America is falling so far behind other countries & we need to learn from their successes.  Finnish revamped their entire educational institution. Privatizing schools is not the answer.
It’s time we #ReThinkDeVos #DumpDeVos #CluelessBetsy #CurellaDeVos
Lip service. What are you up to. What happened to private school vouchers and real change in the socialist school system that teaches socialism. Have you  been assimilated?
In what she quotes, it is a verb (rethink). In her tweet it is a noun (a rethink)  Together, rethink school is a verb and a noun
We should rethink u as secretary
To rethink requires thinking. But I am questioning your qualifications, other than pouring $ to the Kochs & the Trump campaign
And also....


Parents are completely shouldering the burden of raising their children, financially, physically, spiritually, intellectually. All to be handed over on a platter to the mind numbing propagandism of the left? They will NOT infringe on my God-given rights! That's why I home-school. …
It's time you learn something about the educational system. Now.
FYI - paradigm shift hasn't been used in years
Fully fund public education.   That is a good start.
You are the person heading our education department.... really?? #idiotsincharge
How are you going to stop this?!
How about you master thinking through things once before rethinking them? #stoptheignorance
It’s time for you to step down ... everyone else is leaving Donalds sinking ship .. you should too #ignorantTrunt
man, you're so dumb.
No it is time for someone else to consider a Paradigm shift that sees you nowhere near the US education system. Do you realise how ridiculous you sound every time you open your mouth. America great again? Not with you in charge of education.
I hope American children get a better education than yours.
I love this slide! It is so helpful to those of us grizzlies learning to read and write!
Says the woman who can’t form a coherent and meaningful fact-based statement about the actual state of public education and has not “intentionally” visited an underperforming school. #rethinkthis
A so-called war on schools?
Wait, "rethink school" is not a verb. How did you get this job?
In what she quotes, it is a verb (rethink). In her tweet it is a noun (a rethink)  Together, rethink school is a verb and a noun. Not an English major, are you? Even in American English these stay the same.
Maybe. You’re just not the person to do it.
You have no IDEA about FAPE
Why are you the Secretary of Education when you apparently don't know how dictionaries work?
@realDonaldTrump

I know I’m late to the game, but this is a sentence, not a verb. You have proven your incompetence time and again, so I guess we should be dumbfounded at the professionals who gave you this graphic, not you. Hire better help.
Damn. You’re dumb.
cunt
Hey, @Rolling_710 - take that neanderthal bullshit somewhere else. If you can’t disagree with someone civilly, put your phone down. This woman is a direct threat to our republic, but people like you are as well - just in a different, insidious way.
1. Define ‘school.’ Include the physical aspects required: a) a building with rooms? b) personnel to staff it? c) equipment, supplies, library, etc. Let’s start with this definition because students need the physical reality first.

#Resign
Cute graphic. Is this how you spend your time?
FYI - these are questions the dedicated and committed staffs of public schools ask themselves daily! They also ask a 3rd Q: How will we obtain and pay for necessary tools?
I’m surprised you can even think, let alone tweet. I’ve seen vegetables with more brain power than you.
Hi Betsy, appears you are in need of a competent editor/advisor. PM me, I’ll telecommute PT!
All about profit
The only paradigm shift we need is one that changes the lack of funding our public schools are given.
That isn't even a verb...
Idiot gene pool abscess doesn't know grammar
If the legislators  did that you wouldn't be in your position.

That’s a sentence, not a verb.


Question the secretary
i’m not sure you even know what “school” means
Is this a parody account?
what she means by this to throw out public schools and just teach christianity in for profit charters and christian madrasas. throw everything out about how divisive religion is, how it pits students against each other, how it teaches that women are men's playthings, back to 1954
They used to teach christianity in schools to show students how and what to think BEFORE there were enough newspapers, libraries, telephones, TV, or the internet to teach them any other way. Now we have those things for students to CHOOSE from, or choose nothing at all.
It's UNCONSTITUTIONAL to: have a public school employee lead a prayer or participate in a prayer led by a student, to say a prayer before a sporting event or graduation ceremony to the audience, for a school teacher to mention christianity in her/his role as teacher WON'T CHANGE!
Why don't you ask public school teachers how to make education better? We actually have background and knowledge that can help you.
Like maybe getting an actual educator for the job of Secretary of Education?
Have you gotten the message yet that you are unwanted, unqualified, and unable to comprehend the logistics of education? Or should we draw you pictures to help you understand?
I think your time is up. You've proven to be incompetent, uninformed and totally clueless about the reality of a school system. What you've done in Michigan is just lower one set of marks by moving smart,rich children to another place. That's not improvement.

You’re such a rebel, er, grifter.
#PhotoOp
Yes, question EVERYTHING. Such as,
How do we get an unqualified person  who ran her own state’s school system deeper into the abyss to be in charge of the schools for the entire country?  (Oh yeah, money...)
Or,
How do we get said candidate confirmed by the senate? (Money?)
U R so full ofUR eyes R brown!It's time for you to take a hike and go share UR ignorance w/URgrabing friends and give R children the opportunity to succed w/knnowledgeable,qulified representation and real teaching credentials!
Rethink YOU as Secretary of Education.
Try rethinking yourself out of your job.
How about rethink your posistion and resign?
This is what school has always been. You should attend one.
The rethink should be as to whether you have an ounce of competency in your entire body.
Oh good! More meaningless word vomit from singularly  unqualified and compassionless Education Secretary.  #GohomeBetsy
Okay. 
My questions: why guns for teachers & staff; why teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution; how to make teaching as important and respected a profession as, say, law or finance; why let charter schools suck $ away from public schools tho outcomes are no better
Perhaps, but not while you oversee the department because you haven’t got a clue what actually happens in schools. #WhitePrivilege #StopBetsy #MakeAmericaSmartAgain @BurbankRob
What does this even mean????? First question: do you actually know anything about public ed besides what your billionaire friends tell you? 2 When will you start visiting real public schools? 3 Will you listen to pub schl teachers?
Yeah, you should rethink everything, and RESIGN ASAP.
It’s a good thing you have money.  Too bad you couldn’t buy some intelligence.
So you’re saying you support the #NationalWalkoutDay then right?

Before you rethink something you actually have to have a level of competence and knowledge rather than be intent on reorienting the system for your own financial gain. And you've shown you know nothing.
Betsy, were you homeschooled? This is a full sentence, not a “verb”. The subject “you” is implied (imperative), the verb is “rethink”.
Go home rich lady. You don't have the experience, education, or heart for this job. You're just there to destroy and hand over education to your rich buddies to make money off of.
You are an educational nightmare.
You’re a national disgrace.
#rethinkDeVos
Or you could rethink being Secretary of Education and resign.  I would say that’s another option.  That would be my suggestion.
YOU ARE SO FREAKING DUMB!!! OOK WHAT YOU WROTE! Pease help education! You can do it today by RESIGNING!!!! Go back to Michigan and eat bon bons!!!!
Nope. Not YOUR way, that's for fucking sure. 

Go fill god's kingdom from your own backyard.
My son was a student at a WELS Lutheran school.  We were excluded from church & tuition raised to non-member rate.  Why?  Because my son is a Boy Scout.  This is a WI voucher school.  FACTS matter.
Heavens to Betsy... look around your own state before messing with Texas public ed  and other states.    We do not want you here.
Rethink the Sect. of Education

Discipline and basic R's.  No social garbage!
How about you “rethink” investing in schools? (Which you said we shouldn’t do, in case you’ve forgotten.) While you’re at it, rethink your current job position because you’re grossly unfit.
@BetsyDeVosED Our kids learn differently now. Structure HS like college. Lg lectures by the best teachers via video or okay 2 do at home.
That’s not how it works, actually.

I question your qualifications for this job, your ability to carry the job duties out successfully, and the grammar in this poster - Among many other things related to you holding the Secy of Ed post. You’re WHOLLY unqualified. Please resign.
Prepared? Like you were for those disastrous interviews?

Big words from the Amway MLM lady.
you have no idea what you're talking about MEGAFUCKYOU
This coming from the pyramid scheme queen!
Just stop!  You are so ignorant it is embarrassing!
Ok but, what that "rethink" should NEVER include is the siphoning of PUBLIC funds to religious organizations. There's this thing called the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, you should really check it out. Have somebody read it to you, it's interesting.
Why do you hate educated children?
Choice

Your God above all.
You
Are
So
So
Sad
Rethink, a new President and Secretary of Education. We see you Lying Betty
Hey Betsy, rethink what you believe public education is. I rethink how I teach each student HOURLY. What holds me back? Money. Public schools already do an amazing job of rethinking each kid’s education with limited funding. Rethink what we could do if you gave us what we need.
Agreed - #Resign
Why don’t you rethink taking this position as Secretary and resign.
You are incompetent...get out
Why not look at places like Finland who radically changed their system to even the playing field and foster a love for learning and love for self and others and don’t let standardized testing speak for humans who are anything but standardized??
Sometimes I wonder if @BetsyDeVosED is just some sort of f-ed up experiment where they are trying to prove that someone who's wealthy can "overcome" their intellectual defects simply because they were given a position.
Idiot
Please rethink and reconsider resigning for America's sake
It's time for you to resign.
Go to bed Betty! You have lost all the little credibility you had in the tip of your pencil!
Could we rethink who is in charge of education department?
Only if the shift includes firing the incompetent person who is the 11th U.S. Secretary of Education.
It’s time you pursue a new career. Total embarrassment!
Go back to basics. Allow teachers to teach their students the way it works. No more cookie cutter teaching!!!
We can start by rethinking your job
https://twitter.com/wkamaubell/status/973758995356778496?s=21 …. It’s scary that you are the Secretary of Education 
Ummm... @BetsyDeVosED, "Rethink School" is NOT a verb. It is a sentence. Specifically, it is an imperative sentence. (I looked it up.)  Normally, I'm not the grammar police, but I figured since the word "education" is…
The Simpsons predicts the future again...
Worth noting that you used it as a noun in the text of your tweet.
Maybe you should learn what a verb is, because ‘school’ is most definitely a noun.
A two-word sentence is not a verb, Betsy.
Public Ed taught me that. What substandard private education put you through?
It's time you "rethink" your job as the secretary of education.
Let’s start with tuition-free colleges.  Or are you just paying lip service?
Are we also rethinking the English language so that a statement now constitutes a single verb? This brilliance must be why you were placed in this position.
So how about we start with questioning how private and charter schools spend the money they receive? We can continue by questioning how they will be held accountable.


You are totally unqualified to be in this position. 60 minutes interview proved that without a doubt.
WALDORD EDUCATION, Secy DeVos!! THE BEST model for education EVER!!
There is a great deal that we need to rethink but in order to move forward at the same time recapturing what used to be the best about American schools we need to be like parachutes - we will function better when we are open! #IAmReady Are you>
Such a sad time for our country when the Dept of Ed is releasing propaganda material in an attempt to systematically dismantle our great public school system. You should be ASHAMED. No one supports your bogus agenda.
Great slogan. Now fix the schools without making your friends richer and the kids more ignorant.
Yes, and let’s start by appointing a new secretary of education!  #LoveKYPublicEducation
How about you look around the world and see how they provide for low cost or free colleges.  Perhaps if these children saw a future that everyone could afford it would be different.  This includes secondary vocational schools.
You already showed  your true colors.  It's time to rethink how to get someone qualified to be in your position.  Someone who doesn't buy their way in or use their brother to Trump has to back pay him and put his sister in a position she is not qualified to have.
It's time we rethink YOU you big blonde idiot.
FIND A NEW JOB
Most young people have no idea which way they want to go, so they need a BUFFET of knowlege to choose from.Tasting from the selection and going back for the one that hits the spot! Although I have always said, "You can lead a student to knowlege, but you can't make 'em think!"
Yes. Like letting teachers who’ve studied & trained make Education decisions not rich entitled politicians. RETHINK that teachers are professionals- you’re not.
What the Hell does this even mean?
I'll wait.......
LET’S RETHINK YOU...BET YOU ARE GONE SOON...
