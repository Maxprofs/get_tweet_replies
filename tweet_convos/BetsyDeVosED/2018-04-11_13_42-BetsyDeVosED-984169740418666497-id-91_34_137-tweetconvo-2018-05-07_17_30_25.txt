You bought your job.
You are not qualified.
Hey Betsy! What is 2+2? You can't use a calculator.
Very witty. You should feel good
How about don't fuck them over with student loan debt you profit off of...there's a start.
I can just feel the electric excitement at the meeting from that amazing photo. Can you throw a party or what? I’m sure the other attendees will cherish their time with you forever and ever.
Omg you are still around??? Please go away
Why do you continue to demean our education system by pretending to have any relevance? Please resign. You are an insult to those of us who actually know what we are doing!
One way would be to reinstate protections against preditory lenders and scam schools
Yes!!
Wow! What a horrible picture. You look like the evil old hag that you are!
You ignorant POS....
You can barely spell higher education. #ResignNOW
We need to start with public education, starting in preschool so that children will be guided to the path of higher education.  There are still seven countries ahead of us in quality of education; https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-full-list …
How about actually FUNDING education, funding programs for underserved students, and helping families to AFFORD college educations for their children?  Oh - and regulate charter schools that steal tax dollars from PUBLIC schools.
How is teacher moral? You are too dumb to mow grass, let alone run the education department.
When did the  chamber of commerce become experts on education?
OPEN YOUR EYES! Student Debt is Crushing an entire Generation. Is college still worth it? https://www.facebook.com/TuckerCarlsonTonight/videos/619954631673193/?hc_ref=ARSHQuixQDfTbMccB2nBK-HUkQo60y4QcRCImvDV1Um-V7VFm7hvWYjL4U863ABAH6c&fref=nf …
Resign Betty! Your a joke!
America Hates You
You are supremely unqualified and lack even basic knowledge of education. Your opinions are irrelevant. Please show a scant amount of compassion for our nation’s children and resign.
Read. A. Book.
Student loan forgiveness is part of success.
They aren’t students if they graduated, imbecile
Let’s be clear, nobody willingly joins you. No one who is serious about education heeds you at all. You are wasting our time. #resign
Student Loans....?
Good to hear Betsy!

Animals aren't put here for us to torture and use for food.  #SomeoneNotSomething 
You are really, really dense!!! NO ONE likes any of your policies!!! Resign!!! Do the American people a favor!!!
Get out.
How did all those people in the room not throw up from listening to your stupid voice?
Resign. You don't know anything about anything.
How are you going to support & advance higher education when you're dismantling K-12 education?  With your anti-science, anti-history, anti-education agenda, there won't be any "education" left to support & advance.
Madam Secretary, still trying to show you this fabulous STEM program, Pre-Apprenticeship... https://studentrunbusiness.com  #Apprenticeship #apprenticeshipsthatwork #apprenticeships #STEM #jobs @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @SecretaryAcosta @SecretaryPerry #Idaho @PRyan
By support, do your really mean "$upport", right.
You have no supporters, Betsy.  You have no business in education.  Resign, please.
What are you doing to make our schools safer???  What is taking so long???
Here’s a thought!  Gather every states teacher of the year to hear their thoughts.  Their best practices.  Their visions.  That’s who knows best.

Teachers should be getting paid the same if not more than correctional officers.  Teaching is being proactive, prisons are reactive.  Let’s invest in our youth so they don’t end up behind bars
I think you have the hardest job of all the Cabinet Members.  You are like a captain trying to do a 90 degree turn with a supertanker.
One way is to end for profit colleges. One like the corrupt trump university. #TrumpsFoolCabinet #TrumpsMorons #HowDoesSheStillHaveAJob
Why does everyone in the room look dumbfounded by ur stupidity?
Take @SpeakerRyan cue and QUIT
You’re a disgrace and unqualified. Resign!!!
Courtney  @thewoodworkher is right. You are a disgrace - please resign.
Our education system will never improve as long as you are in charge. You are an absolute disgrace to teachers all across this great country.
This is all great.  Stay away from private vouchers with my tax $ please.
Pooyie. My O&G flashback  Amway industrial products stockpiled by Oil Execs- > sold to their own oilfield service cos  = IRS tax crimes. But back end pts. Did Erik revisit Scamway playbook? #SpectrumBank #CambridgeAnalytica #NRAinMoscow
@HUDgov Ms DeVos local schools/communities need to address pblm of disruptive kids in class; pblm parents/brokenhomes; teachers cant teach, students cant learn; unfair to all!

2 ideas to help:
Fund primary schools so they have a better start going INTO higher ed
Stop loan companies from preying on college students and stop colleges from jacking up tuition to fund out of control sports programs.
Resign.
This woman needs to go. The people respect the office and not the person. She is clueless
18 AGs sue the Department of Education over Gainful Employment Rule
Attorneys general sue DeVos over delay of rule to protect students from predatory colleges
Once again, @BetsyDeVosED put interests of for-profit career education programs ahead of hardworking students.
Company with DeVos ties awarded Education Dept debt-collection contract: report | TheHill
DeVos Is Sued By 17 States; Richard Spencer And Colleges; Race and Student Loans - http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/10/21/558825046/devos-is-sued-by-17-states-richard-spencer-and-colleges-race-and-student-loans … via http://news.google.com 
Hey @BetsyDeVosED, your job is not to punish students that struggle to repay their loan debt. Unfair and cruel.
And just so no one forgets how bad you really are DeVos:

Schools began ignoring rape reports after DeVos' campus sexual assault policy changes, lawsuit says https://www.dailykos.com/story/2018/1/29/1736910/-Schools-began-ignoring-rape-reports-after-DeVos-campus-sexual-assault-policy-changes-lawsuit-says … …

In case you haven’t noticed teachers are on strike in various places across the nation. The issues are clear! Pull your head out and start addressing our education problem instead of traveling all over to talk. Actually do something!
Why haven’t u Resigned?  I’ve asked u several times weekly.
Isn’t that all the stuff you want to get rid of? Please resign you have no business being Secretary of Education!
Maybe we could make sure our kids live that long through #GunControlNow . #OutlawTheNRA #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #NeverAgain
Resign
What do you know about educating young people Betsy? Seriously, what in your past has prepared you for this task? Nothing. That's what. You have zero credibility, and zero integrity.
#BlueWave #Resist #FBR
Cutting down on the loans needed and adding additional loan forgiveness programs
Where's the money Betsy?
Oh yeah I forgot, the wealthy entitled figure it's up to locals to figure it out.
#goptaxscam
Pretty sure you should be focused on the stuff before graduation.
The absolute BEST way to advance higher education in the USA is for Betsy DeVos to go back to selling soap at Amway, or just join her corrupt brother Eric Prince in the Seychelles Islands and stay there!!! We DON’T LIKE you #BitchBetsyDeVos #DumpDevos #AmwayIsntOurWay
@BetsyDeVosED Earlier This Week: “Our K-12 system is failing our kids”

@BetsyDeVosED  Today: “We must advance higher Ed and promote student success beyond graduation.”

You and your brother are going to prison for your lives.
We can start by accepting your resignation.
Go away. Far, far away.
Take your crooked brother with you and disappear! #MAGA
The worst secretary of education in history.
Dumbass #DumbassDeVos


The best way to improve higher education in the US would be for Betsy DeVos to resign. That's not a joke.

Please resign.
Here's a great one-step program to promote student success: Resign
Don’t you have some children whose hearts you should be eating now?
