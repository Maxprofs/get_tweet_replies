That's a great idea. Maybe put more money into PUBLIC schools and rid the system of student performance and progress as the sole process for measuring a teacher. Also, let's find ways to pay teachers more and give them access to resources. So...
Let's KEEP #NetNeutrality so that teachers and students can access content and let's stop pushing for school vouchers for private institutions. 
You want to #RethinkSchool ? Do something about crushing student loan debt. @BetsyDeVosED is making it easier for for-profit schools to scam students.
Like I said DeVos and the GOP want no one in college else they are rich It alabout DeVos and hubby are too cheap and greedy to pay school tax
Maybe cause of all the fraudulent debt from predatory schools you like to sponsor.
How ironic. You are actively squeezing college students and victims of scams and fraud for every penny you and your rich cronies can get out of them. Careful Betsy. Your family is riddled with crime - and your skin tone would look fabulous in prison orange.
@BetsyDeVosED will turn higher education into Trump university: for-profit scams that line her pockets
But Hillsdale College, tho
Hmm, a noteworthy focus, student loan relief initiatives must occur or we will push students through college to dwell in student loan debt.
Please get rid of common core as fast as you can!

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …
What about no child left behind? It has left many behind and now this crazy common core!!! You said you were going to get rid of it!

Register to vote. Get two friends registered to vote. Throw a voter registration party. 

At the end of the day, this administration is bad for you, it’s bad for us,…


Graduating students turn their backs on Betsy DeVos at University of Baltimore — https://shareblue.com/graduating-students-turn-their-backs-on-betsy-devos-at-university-of-baltimore/ … #Shareblue
@BetsyDeVosED.  Lets redefine the pathway and broaden its scope so we can get back to real teaching.

"In college, of course, students have to flourish without constant supervision. Although charter students are admitted to college at higher rates than students from comparable public schools, their graduation rates are dispiritingly low."  http://ow.ly/qs4k30hb1B4 
You should be ashamed of yourself! You don’t belong in this position. Do you have a PHD in education? No, what you do is buy yourself a position.
How many are squeezed to death by student loan debt and college costs?
If All the educated would Stop, Think & Realize; It is More about the Heart of man First, then All other things would be in harmony;Love, respect, character, morality, Charater, honor, dignity & integrity.The Spirit man Needs spiritual food for his spirit to be at Peace
Plus we have dumbed down the public school system and dumbed down the people we hire to teach to the point it will take years to overcome.  Too many changes like the new math that didn’t fly .  Need more vocational opportunities for the 35% who should never be in college.
