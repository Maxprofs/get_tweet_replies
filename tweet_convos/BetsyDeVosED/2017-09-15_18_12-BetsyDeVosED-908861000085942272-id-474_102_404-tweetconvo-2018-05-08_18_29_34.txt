Now what? Bankrupt the schools and cash in on vouchers?
Lol wut. The vouchers go to the schools.
Bankrupt the public schools and give cash to the for-profit private schools.
Profit creates incentive to do good. Twitter is for profit.
You may wanna read the research on dismal effects of vouchers:
That's because it's not done right. You must allow the school to go out of business so bad schools fail and good schools do better.
Yeah cause that won't fuck with a kids future...
How would it do that?
We won't let you turn our schools into a pyramid scheme. Go away.
Millions of taxpayer dollars wasted on your photo ops, while you want to defund Special Olympics & public schools
Just found out you did that tour on your private jet, but made tax payers foot the bill. Good on you for perpetuating your evil. #DumpDeVos
Republican dictionary "school choice" = bucks in the bank accounts of my pals.
Mrs. De Vos, a lot of corruption in Los Angeles Unified School District. They always claim "lack of funds".
I like it! Betsy DuhVos. Much easier than Toe-curling Blood-curdling Breaks Mirrors DuhVomit.
Dear Ms. Sec. Please, help our kids & http://dreams.Tax  payers bailed out Banks. Invest in our kids.Why not moratorium on collecting student loans4 10 yrs &banks obsorbs10% of loans4 10 yrs. Start fresh later. Thnx.. Happy Thanksgiving Holiday
You should quit now. You're doing a bad job.
#RethinkDeVos.  She is trying to steal the education of poor urban Americas. #unqualified #ivorytowerelitistcoward
DeVos has just rescinded 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students.@cathymcmorris @SenatorHassan
Support early childhood education!!
Wrapped up because people don’t want you in schools!
You know nothing of education. Just making money off of education.
The GOP budget would slash Pell Grant funding, which makes college more   affordable for more than 8 million students, by more than $100B.  Don't  let them do this.  If you do the US is going to fall behind and they're  won't be people to fill the jobs that do require a college

Duh. Can't believe trump picked her for education post - wait, I do believe it because he picked the worst person for each cabinet position.
You should be utterly ashamed of yourself.

Dear @BetsyDeVosED,Please view and reply to: http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal … Emailed @usedgov 
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse please assist - thanks! 
This is so true:
DeVos Defends Trump by Saying: 'Would a Moron Hire Me?'

I think she just answered the question and insulted herself all at once.
Ma’am, did you visit any public schools at all? Your one-sided, close-minded view of education helps no one, least of all our children.
How about did you talk to teachers?  The ones in the trenches?  No.  Too busy with amway, right?
Did u know a hi % of Antifa Activists are School Unions/teachers/professors? Bill Ayers has the unions promoting Hate & Anarchy. Can U STOP?
As education secretary is one of your job requirements the ability to speak and preform math appropriately? U did say 3 people = 4 people
Trump sure likes to be surrounded by kin folk #MORONS
How do you plan to close the gap between the quality and appropriateness of education for special needs students vs. mainstream students?
Dear Sec.DeVos.Our kids& future needs you! Please, help&Invest in our kids. Student loans R a mess & our kids unfairly duped. Why not start fresh after reducing those loans2 principle& split it4ways,fed,bank,state, &Students.Erease& stop collection after 10yrs. Start smart loans.
And our taxpayers should go to 275 student charter schools that pay CEO salaries? Puhleeze. No.
http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/amp/Small-Houston-charter-school-pays-top-dollar-to-12332395.php …

The new tax bill would tax tuition waivers for graduate students, many of whom subsist on cat food  http://www.chronicle.com/article/Republican-Tax-Proposal-Gets/241662 …
When is Sec DeVos going to focus on her primary responsibility - PUBLIC SCHOOLS?!! Most of our children are in PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

DeVos Defends Trump: 'Would a Moron Hire Me?' 
Yes, Betsy, only a moron would hire you, and then only if he was paid.
Better check with @realDonaldTrump tweets before we can believe that this is not #FakeNews!
Absolutely.  The moron DID hire you.
I still can't believe you got appointed to Eductation.   You suck.  Go back to where you came from.

Shhhh

Please stop wasting our tax payer money! You are not qualified for your position. Resign!!
Are you going to pay back Americans for your $6.5 MILLION in security detail?
Culture must be addressed: Gov. Public School System must inspire Love, Respect, Integrity;Character building w/love for one another as self
Know this: History will list you as a member of the regime that blighted this nation. Shame on you.

You profit and students suffer.  Quit!!!
Devos! You are absolutely unqualified to hold an education position.  Quit now.

STOP EXPLOITING BLACK WOMEN AND CHILDREN
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE BEING TAUGHT OUR HISTORY.AMERICA'S HISTORY.THE LEFT IS TRYING TO STRIP OUR SCHOOLS OF OUR HISTORY.
Hey Betsy, I'd be VERY concerned about that Spectrum Health server if I were you. You are earning #MuellerTime! Not to mention NY crimes.
Talk to your brother, he's due for his time in the barrel 

Lord, she has tweeted for 11 days. Maybe our kids are safe. #RethinkDeVos
Here's one OLD retired school principal/univ prof/former U S Marine that thinks you're doing a GREAT JOB!


#filltheswamp
WOW!! So many haters and DUMB DUMB tweeting. I support President Trump administration. MAGA !!!
dear madam - I am researching all of the 50 states' truancy laws. what an eye opening experience!
What about the kids who are American citizens and live in Puerto Rico. How about advocating for them and getting an aid package to PR asap!
What a disgrace. The entire Trump cabinet consists of low life creeps.
Betsy DeVos, who was born into billionaire family and married into another, mocks defrauded students as greedy http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59c9239de4b0f2df5e83b032 …

@BetsyDeVosED you are a menace to students and women
So do you even care about public schools and institutions at all?
So, u went to a bunch of schools that were already doing innovative things b4 u ever showed up. And your point is..."choice?" #yourefired
You suck at your job. Quit now before you destroy the education system in this country.
#unqualified
How about we rethink who should be secretary of education? Maybe someone with experience?
#College women, Devos is making sure that getting #raped is a part of your curriculum! https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-22/obama-campus-assault-guidance-gets-scrapped-under-trump …  #rape #sexism #rapeculture
@BetsyDeVosED is making #campusrape better for the #rapists!  Stops investigation on #sexualviolence.  Devos doesn't care if you are #raped!

#HelpPuertoRico Public schools in PR need help and those kids need help they pay us taxes help them now
Why do you hold any position? You are the very worse thing to happen to education you under qualified rich white woman.
your depraved behavior toward rape victims really makes me wonder if your sons raped girls in college and u were angry you had 2 pay victims

You are detrimental to every person both young and old wanting to get a better education for themselves. Resign already. #youboughtthatspot
Yes!! DeVos will be known as the spolied opportunist who ruined American public education for her & her entitled friends own gain. SHAMEFUL
Thanks for your dedication to kids & strength to ignore the haters. Proud of you ridding us of the Title IX nightmare so destructive to many
You don't care about education you don't care about anything. you are possibly the worst pick #45 made.
What a sick lady. You should be ashamed, Betsy.
All schools in my district offer special ed services and are non discriminatory. Rethink?
A public pre-k in my district is a Reggegio school! Do we rethink that?
a public high in my district known as rough started offering IB to students. Do we rethink that?
My public high school offered courses like, good vs evil. Great books, AP courses, 4 foreign languages, now its bio med focus. Rethink??
and crushing down education like this! This is the most inhuman thing I've seen. 
...big time! Tearing every inch by inch of people's love for intelligence and wanting to be successful. #betsydontcare :/
You're ruining everything!!! You're not helping the world, you're destroying the world. and not only that but you're also ruining education
You're a failure at your job. Resign. Failing to protect and promote student interests. Just a photo op.
"Betsy DeVos Rescinds Key Obama-Era Policy On Campus Sexual Assault." Cui bono? Young men.
@BetsyDeVosED Have you thanked a rapist today? Yes you have- and are supporting them! #sickdevos #immoral #buyaconscience #Hellistoogood4you
You don't invest in public schools or unions and you are now empowering campus rapists. Hell is now constructing a large city in your name
Is your puppy coat done yet?
Name one teacher or student. You Trump people only seem to like black people when you need a picture. #yousuck
What kind of barbaric demon rescinds protections for sexual assault victims??  I see you're touring schools to find new ways to hurt kids.
Thanks Betsy. I'm sure your very very proud of what you did today. #BetsyDeVos
Those figures are liberal lies, no one would go to college if they were accurate. Stop the divisive tactics, you minimize real sex assault
#resign You're a disgrace on every front.
Do u know how many campus rapes go unreported bc women r afraid they won't be believed? I wasn't (after my 3 hour stranger rape) Shame on u.
Hey @BetsyDeVosED stop blocking people who want to tell you about their rape. Your actions have real consequences and you need to face them.
SHAME! You are unbelievable! How can anyone support this admin and especially this hateful woman!


(1/2) Sec. DeVos is putting rights of the accused above those of sexual assault victims. Absolutely unconscionable. http://lat.ms/2xklwIw 
What schools are they .inner city schools with a high percentage of black/Latino ??
Your anti-Enlightenment drive, Ms. DeVos, to remove Publick School from the Gov’t’s expenses, is duly noted.
You suck
U R an #evil incompetent who has no business being anywhere around education!
Stop hurting this country.
Betsy DeVos just undid one of Obama’s most significant efforts to stop campus rape http://ow.ly/rqTr30fmH6Z  
Do America a favour and resign.
