I am completely in awe. Dummy DeVos made it through an entire tweet with no spelling errors. This is now the pinnacle of her tenure.
She made an error look again! Nation’s
It was not her typical spelling, but merely grammar. I give her a D-.

Senate Democrats 'deeply troubled' by 'racist, bigoted' views shared by Trump education appointees http://politi.co/2jYsGeb  via @politico
It’s unconscionable that our top Education official won't commit to speaking out against discriminatory policies:
How the Right-Wing Koch and DeVos Families Are Funding Hate Speech on College Campuses Across the U.S. |
You have never stepped foot in a classroom for a day’s work. You’re a national embarrassment. #Oligarchy
Resign.
Can’t you spell, for Christ’s sake? nation’s
Of course she had the requisite grammatical error..... nation's
Betsy Devos: Inept and unqualified. #Resign
Knowing you Vicious DeVos is he a Republican NAZI or KKK?

Oh, how are you going to help the teachers of West Virginia? You going to help them get that pay raise? Or just figure out another way to screw them over?
I am not excited. Trump appointed you, so far your a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! So I am not going to expect anything from Johnny, another person appointed by Trump!
We have an Education Solution that will provide EXTREEME Unequaled HELP to the black community, don't have any black schools engaged yet. Please help us help them...
*nation's
nation's ...
Hey Education Secretary, you surely must know that the word is nation's ... possessives require an apostrophe.  Or, were you absent that day in grammar school?  God help us!
#MAGCA
There is no way that Donald Trump could produce that statement. I challenge you to ask him to say this, in front of a camera, today. He won't, because he's never said it, never will, and is incapable of any sort of consideration for non-white groups in academia or elsewhere.
You can’t even spell! SAD
See you failed your first year review with a solid F! Surprise, surprise!
Since #CruellaDeVos can’t be trusted, we’d be justified in looking closely at @JohnnyCTaylorJr’s resume:
- graduate of private universities (UMiami & Drake)
- Trustee of private college boards (UMiami, Drake, & Cooper Union)
- current head of SHRM, a pro-Corp/anti-worker org
It is clear that you still don't understand the difference between growth and proficiency. Do you still think guns in school are a good idea? Children are DEAD. What are you doing to protect our teachers, students, and staff from being massacred? You are not qualified. RESIGN.
@BetsyDeVosED
@realDonaldTrump Keeping your word  GREAT Work 

youre shit
Great work Betsy! End the monopoly on education! #vouchers
Betsy, you are not doing well. And you look so, so tired. Aren't you tired?
Will you quit already?  #paytoplay #BoycottNRA
Are you also Excited to announce,  you will protect companies that scam students? EVEN when the break state law? Asking fo my son.
Why have you proposed protecting student loan collectors from state regulators cracking down on their abuses?

You're an unqualified fool who just wants to get free tuition for your rich Christian friends.
You are not qualified. #Resign
