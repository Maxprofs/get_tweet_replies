Gobernador enfoque esos fondos federales en preservar las escuelas modelos y no se despifalrre en contratos inutiles del Dept.Educ.
Good.  By the Trump Administration.  Don't forget.
I remember how they’ve virtually ignored PR for the last 9 months.
Please don’t steal it again.
Don't count the money until you get the check
Well FINALLY!  What’s your next move, Betsy?  Get an expert in there before you blow the funds!!!  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @IvankaTrump - Betsy needs your help!  She has NO clue!!
Lets make sure it gets to the schools and students!!!!!
You're still a pinhead, Betsy.
Noticias como éstas no le interesa a la Asociación pq 
son soluciones. Soluciones q ellos no traen ni traerán. Ésa es la la diferencia d un Gobierno q trabaja a un par d idiotas q sólo critican y hacen paros. Big deal!

Otro logro,Sr.Gibernador,gracias
It would be great for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to retweet this.
She would take an actual shit on Puerto Rico if she could

Betsy DeVos wants to destroy public education. Also, she supports the politicians who protect the NRA and enable school shootings to continue. Think about that.
Boughsty only cares about how much money she can bilk out of these people. Don't you @BetsyDeVosED , the most INCOMPETENT person on Earth.
as long as these funds are used in public schools these are great news.
(please keep track of how and who is spending that money)
Lol to public schools or charter school garbage?
Our schools need that too!  Happy for Puerto Rico, very needed.  Our schools are really old and need help
Por favor no cierren injustamente la Escuela Jacinto Lopez Martinez de Dorado Pueblo, en la cual hay mas de 300 estudiantes y buena planta fisica. En donde los estudiantes de Educ. Especial resiben servicios de terapias entre otros.
