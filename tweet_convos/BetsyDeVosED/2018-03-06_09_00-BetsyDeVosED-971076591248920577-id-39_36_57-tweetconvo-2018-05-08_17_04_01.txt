Poor form. She doesn’t deserve a platform to spread her ignorance and lack of the respect for our teachers
@Melissa1Kelly @KellyClewell @larrylabue @CrystalTrotter did y’all go to this?
Attended lots of great sessions @sxswedu but missed @BestsyDeVosED There were more qualified presenters at that time
I bet!  Hahaha!!
I sure hope she shares the backpack full of cash trailer.
It's a must see if you want a good picture of Betsy DeVos plan for our children's future.
Curious to see how this s out... Especially when we teach Ss about the theory of healthy and respectful debate. Do we practice what we preach? 
Why?
Boycotting the bigot known as @BetsyDeVos ,@BetsyDeVosED .
Are bears invited?
@BetsyDeVos isn't qualified to speak.
Wish I would have known I would have flown to Austin
Just lost all my respect for you guys. You deserve all the bad press that I hope you get.
I thought they were only allowing qualified people to speak at the conference. Very disappointed in @sxswedu for letting frauds like Betsy DeVos spew their hatred. #fundpublicschools #supportpubliceducation

Booooo
In over your head
I hope she got booed the entire time.
Betsy DeVos can only credibly speak on how money corrupts government and allows people who are not qualified gain positions of influence and power in our country.  Students deserve better, teachers deserve better and our public schools deserve better.
This should be good...
A1: Certain kids already get suspended more, in #SPED they get physically restrained more, and in states that still allow corporal punishment, they get paddled more. Wonder how strapping educators might backfire? #BMEsTalk http://hechingerreport.org/controversy-corporal-punishment-public-schools-painful-racial-subtext/ … …

"Does a Lack of Paddling Cause School Shootings?"

Some people--including a lieutenant governor--say corporal punishment of kids at school (as well as home) is the answer to mass shootings. Chris…

Do well to share the truth about education, training, teaching a child in the right way to go in life to fulfill their GOD given potential using their talents with moral character & do away with the Liberal ARTS Curriculum Indoctrination which has given us our decades of culture
Austin has no love for Betsy. She will #keepaustinweird in all the wrong ways. #SXSWedu #sxsw
Ask her why she isnt asking for more money for public schools and especially for special education.
Give us a shootout at @weliveitout
