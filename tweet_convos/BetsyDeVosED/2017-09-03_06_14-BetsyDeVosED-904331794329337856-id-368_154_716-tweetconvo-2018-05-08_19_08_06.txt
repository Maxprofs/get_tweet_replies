President Trump proclaims Sunday, September 3, 2017 a National Day of Prayer: http://45.wh.gov/Sk3CB4 
Who in need has this admin passed any legislation to protect? Those in need have been thrown out in the cold in favor of rich & powerful!

How can you make it safer for rapists? And not watch out for rape victims ? How can you live with yourself!?!?!?!?? You are the enemy
Praise Jesus
You don't 'PRAY,' you 'PREY' on the American people. God will judge your evil ways.
This is NOT A THEOCRACY FIRST OF ALL. Secondly, you are NOT QUALIFIED TO LEAD ANY DEPARTMENT... YOUR HATEFUL RHETORIC IS NOT CALLED FOR.
Not only hoping that on a sum1,but ona wife&grandmother! Ur fine as gold but the only man who should sexually assault u is ur husband!woooow
I just read something that struck a fuckin nerve! Who the fuck hopes that om someone! Sorry for the language but curse that lame ass dude!
We DEEPLY PRAY that Betsy Devos masquerading as an Educator will resign and the system can heal from the cancer she left.  AMEN!


Why did you strip campus victims of sexual assault of their rights?  What the hell is wrong with you????
My mom's a victim of repeated rape & sexual assault by my dad so I have sensitive spot about that. He's away4life but I remember the fights!
You may call ur-self a republican but don't u dare call ur-self a Christian! Protecting rapists and not the victims - #StopBetsyِ #Resist
Hoping each of her grandchildren gets raped in college… Without recourse...
I would not wish that on any women. She is violating the victims all over again - these people in office have no soul or humanity 
Put prayer back in schools.  We grew up with it and those who didn't want to , We need God
That's great! I pray you get new highlights! #gaysserveapurpose
Go on Betsy. Get your hands dirty by assisting in the clean up of a TX school. I dare you!

Betsy, go lick a cactus
Perhaps I missed it...would love to know the rationale for taking away Title IX
Thank you for your dedication to our country and its children, our future. Continue leaning on God's truth and not the ugly words of humans.
God was created by ugly words of humans.
No, my dear, God was not. God is love.
Have you read the Bible? That's the only "evidence" and he doesn't seem very loving.
As for evidence, God loved me and met me in the middle of my unbelief and delivered me from a place of deep despair. My testimony is real.
That's great for you. Religion and the idea of God made me deeply unhappy. Believe what you want - but keep it out of PUBLIC school.
You still appear to be quite unhappy, or at a minimum, angry. So, how's unbelief working for you?
You know what's working for you? That self-righteous judging thing.
You satan's spawn shouldn't pretend to pray!
All I  wannna say as I do on any day for any other man who doesn't understand is that if a woman says no b a man&let it go. no remorse4force
I fear deeply for the immediate future for our country!  Between you and @realDonaldTrump our immediate future is bad & the distant 1 is too
Separation of church and state. WTFU
Again by leading separation of church and state. Please read the constitution. You know nothing
We are in awe of the courage you have shown in the face of all this lunacy
I there really was a God, you & Trump would be far away from government. Thanks for shitting on our Education system!
Why do Republicans keep getting Rape wrong. I mean Who Gets Rape Wrong? - @RealDonaldTrump doesn't have to repeal Everything that Obama did.

You're literally the worst
Fake Christian, you're Secretary of Education position is バカ that could care less about disabled students, and rape survivors. #Shame
Your ignorance and stupidity amazes me.
Pls if illegals are allowed here  increase funding for education, lots of illegals in the schools in CT My city has 28 kids in a class :(
You're sickening ...  please please go away.
Separation of church and state .... no prayers more actions !
do all of us GOOD patriots and our children a favor.  RESIGN.   you don't deserve a position you know nothing about.
Shame on u. U too shall be judged
Including rape victims? #TitleIX
They couldn't think of who else they could hurt. Then someone said-- what about rape victims?  And  Betsey said PERFECT!
Lying SOS!

Apparently private schools don't teach separation of church & state?  Our Forefathers didn't want a "King George" in the United States. SAD
I bet you think of the victim and the rapist like Trump and his "both sides." I hope you're never assaulted by a "fine rapist klansman"
Oh this is rich.  You..pray...for what?  Rapists to get away with raping on campuses?  Oh okay.  That I see.  #supporttitleIV
Hi Bets, you're right along side Michigans Todd "legitimate rape" Akin. and Idahos Pete Nielsen "you can't get pregnant from rape.":)
Are you going to pray for the rape victims you're taking protections from?
You have two daughters who must be horribly ashamed of you. You are a horrible example of woman......
Was it prayer or money that helped get you this job?
Amway actually
Very fine people on both sides, right, secretary? Rapists and victims alike...
#impeachTrump and all his awful appointees, too.
Government employees should pray on their own time, not ours.
your prayers are a clanging noise I'm sure you'll never get your lily whites dirty #dontforget2bringyourstilettos when you go to help out
Pray for the rape victims you are NOT protecting! #Resign
I am praying that we survive your corrupt and incompetent term of office.  I am praying you leave office soon.
You're a digesting excuse for a human being.
What the hell is wrong with you? Are you even human?
You have got to be the worst person to ever have a part in education
Empty words from an empty woman.
Pray for the young women off to college with few protections against sexual assault.
Are you advocating Prayer on a Government account?  Naughty Naughty Ms. DeVos!   You ARE going to have to change YOUR Trump ways!
But you want to protect rapists? You piece of 
God doesn't hear prayers from a villain like you!
praying for all the college girls who get raped and you rolled back protections? Keep praying Betsy but no heaven for you !
We are not heeling! You need to resign, unqualified, uneducated crook! YOU ARE NOT RESPECTED
Clergy consulting on sexual assault at schools is a smart move. They're very experienced and will really help in your fight against victims.
I mean, clergy have sexually assaulted pupils and covered it up for decades. So who better to advise you in your holy crusade against kids?
DeVos takes the side of rapists.
unless you are a victim of campus rape
Some nerve speaking of prayer you evil  practitioner of witchcraft to reap financial gain
How about you pray for your soul. You just condoned rape and showed your support for rapists. #BetsySupportsRape #NotHuman
Yeh, pray 4 the kids ur taking good education away from. #LOSER u don't know meaning of prayer or caring #LIAR
How do you sleep at night?
You know you are full of shit, right? #fakenews
I never expected such a christian administration to be pro-rape and soft on rapists. How odd! "You shall know them by their works."
They rape and go on their way and ask for forgiveness and all is well. And then they blame the woman…
How many rapists are going to get away scot-free and laugh thanks to your policies, Betsy? Jesus cares more about that than your tax cuts.
You are an embarrassment to the idea of higher education. Your appointment was a joke. #youknowthatright
You are truly a horrible human being. I hope what happens to women across college campuses never happens to you
I am deeply grateful that you are putting a stop to unjust false accusations

Bullshit. We have a separation of church and state. This is unconstitutional. You're too stupid to even realize it. Department of stupidity.
Forget this little speech. Do you know how stupid and ignorant you are?  I mean you make Donald Trump look smart & that is something!! GOD!!
Separation of church and state....it's in the Constitution.
And hope you predecessor will quickly rescind your harmful policies. You should be ashamed of yourself, but you are too shallow for that!
What a pathetic and  poor choice you were. More than any other cabinet member I look forward to the day you leave office.
I am absolutely disgusted by you and your move to rescind title IX guidelines. As the mother of a College student I find it disgraceful!
U are an unqualified, evil witch & u prove that @POTUS hands out jobs to donors with no moral compass or soul. History will judge u harshly
LmFUCKINGao it's called separation of church and state you robot
You literally are the worst of everything.
You are a fraud.
Rescinding Title IX Letter is just another RACIST step taken by the Trump Administration. They should all be thrown in prison! #LockThemUp
you better pray for salvation. hard.
You just made campuses safer for RAPISTS! Congratulations! I hope the're class action suits against your evil vileness! RAPISTS R in w/ U
Boss is a rapist so gotta remove any rape reporting from colleges. Only makes sense.
Exactly! Why else would she do this. She is clueless and for those that believe "godless". Sickening!
Just like Brock Turner, the Stanford Rapist, he got 3 months in jail. Sickening what e got away with.
How do you even sleep at night?
@WhiteHouse ... #thePeople pray for #Irma to wash all your evil asses straight to Hell... #CabinetofDeplorables #Amenofcourse
Hail, Satan!
Hey @BetsyDeVosED, where did your demented Daddy & war criminal brother, Erik, touch you to make you believe, "rape is cool"?
You're disgraceful!
CorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorruptCorrupt
BullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshit UGH
You're disgusting @BetsyDeVosED
PS @BetsyDeVosED  your fake president proclaimed the "National Prayer Day"
Then he decided to destroy DACA
What a bunch of rotten apples
Be sure to tell them to have a good time in the shelter
Make sure they're armed if it's bear country,  Right?
You're the worst person to be in charge of the youths education, you need to fix that tan your neck is like 100xs darker then your face 
"we need to stop Betsy Devos" - America
#StopBetsy
Your religion has no place on college campuses. Pray for the students who will b assaulted bc of you. Shameful. You + rapist against victim.
Your a sell out!
You can't pray when you're Satan
Rolling back campus sexual assault guidelines and protections?  Have you no decency? You should be ashamed.
They're unfair as they currently stand.
Albatross
I love your savage.
Soooo now you don't care about women who are sexually assaulted on campus....very sad
Betsy you are Christian Tailban, evil evil hypocrite
Keep your religion to yourself, Betsy. Oh, and how lovely of you to support rape culture in schools. Go away!  #resist #NotMyPresident
Oh she's full speed to get rid of it
#FAKECHRISTIAN
The most HATED Secretary of Educations has no clue what education mean
Pervert always pray.BdVos is an accomplice of criminals,she siding with pervert by removing prior administration sexual assaults protection
Praying while rolling back Title XI protections for sexual assault victims...You are worse than a Pedophile Priest!
You and this administration don't do anything but harm, so what are you praying for?
What you're doing to this country is evil. When the majority of Americans say NO, and our "leaders" keep saying yes it's a dictatorship!

DeVos, the antithesis to education, is taking away #TitleIX protections.
Next up, no Ed for women bc it'll make campuses safer.
 #StopBetsy 
Betsy, you suck.
Betsy. Do your homework honey.  National prayer day has been in existence since when?   Newsflash: u can use google for extra credit.  Dumb
