@POTUS had absolutely ZERO interest in anyone dying until this last group of amazing kids FORCED him to act like he cares. All he is doing now is trying to find the easiest way he can pacify us, while still doing exactly what the NRA PAYS him to do.
I am INFURIATED that DEVOS is being given this job. HER of ALL people. #GFY

You mean there are things that don't involve outlawing guns that can make schools safer?  Huh!!  I wonder who knows that?


Hey everybody, let's vote out of office any politician that has an "A" rating from the NRA!
Eat broken glass, Betsy
Then get the grizzly bear  lady to resign
What are you going to do about the teacher in California that shot his gun today and injured 3 students? We will be seeing many more incidents of this under your plan by allowing more guns in our schools. What are you going to do??? Don’t arm teachers!
@BetsyDeVosED #Resign
Have you received a tweet from Trumpty Dumpty yet?  Your time surely is coming up! Watch out for that "compliment".  Don't let the school door slam you in the ---.
You can keep children and youth safe by resigning.
Why is wrong always allowed to rule? If Right thing to do was taught in the Public School System we would not be looking for Armed Guards to protect the schools from children. Teach a child the right way to go, when he matures he will not depart & Creates a new Culture of Peace


I promote YOUR RESIGNATION!
