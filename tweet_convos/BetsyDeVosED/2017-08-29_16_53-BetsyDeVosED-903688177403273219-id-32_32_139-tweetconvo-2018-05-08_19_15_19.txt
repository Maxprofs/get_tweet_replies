Isn't this the same legislation you vetoed because you did not want to help CPS?
Hey, he is probably giving up and deciding he can't fight the Democrat majority in continuing to make sure IL goes down the crapper $-wise
So there is no fighting @ilsendems & @housedemsil majority in their quest to make sure this state burns financially. #byeillinois
Lol State only had 4 billion in back bills and were set to get them caught up.  The head count of state employees decreased under democrats
Gov Never proposed a budget to show democrats the better way. but his buddies will roll in the dough from higher interest payment on bonds

Here you go. Here are the budgets he proposed. Again, not the best, but better than what the GA wanted.
It doesn't surprise me that you know nothing of educational policy:
This research is bunk. Doesn't take into account that most ppl will choose their districts, but will choose otherwise if inner city
& bring in vouchers which will decimate public ed. Congrats. U R worst gov IL's ever seen. with our history that's really saying something.
So you are saying I shouldn't be able to use my tax dollars to send my kids to a school of my choice?
It is a  shame you're losing your base Gov
A shame but not a surprise. He's traded his morals and the needs of the CITIZENS of the state with acceptance by liberal democrats.
.@GovRauner Do Your Job. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C66wE_2UwAETi5v.jpg …
Why don't you tell us who "did their job" that gave us 15 years of deficit spending?  Go on, tell us.
Your precious Democrats had 15 years of iron fisted majority rule to do right by this state.  But they didn't.  Oh, but 2 years of Rauner??
Also, potentially takes away my teaching job/career. Thanks Rauner, you are a hypocrite or delusional if you think you helped "kids" today.
If you're doing a bad job, you deserve to be fired
It's completely illegal though. No state money for religions.
: your press staff doesn't return messages. When, where are you signing the bill?
You're a disgrace. 
Resign already. 
I am truly embarrassed as a Republican that I voted for you. It won't happen again.
Two pathetic people who've never spent a day in the classroom!
Congratulations, Illinois.  You have decimated public education with a smile.

Why?  Said you wouldn't cave,  you'd change the direction of Illinois.  You are a puppet to Rahm the criminal and Mad Mike.
Severance packages for broke public pension/retirement/health ponzi scheme plans and leave education to families!!
Sellout!
thank you Govenor Rauner
Today Gov Rauner made Illinois a Sanctuary state so all that $$ he is telling you he w/spend on education reform will be ate up on illegals!
Dear Governor, welcoming immigrants is great, but harboring ones that have committed crimes isnt.  U have done a disservice to People of IL
What did the tax breaks for wealthy donors have to do with this. Tacked on pork to make it more palatable?
Who's going to pay for all the Illegals Immigrants you just gave Sanctuary to?
No they didn't. They bailed out the CPS & the CTU bankrupt pension program. We'll be revisiting this again in 3 years.
Who. Is. Paying. For. That.
Those that stay behind and voted for the majority of the crooks in @ilsendems & @HouseDemsIL
