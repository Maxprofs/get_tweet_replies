DeVos corruption once again:
My hope is Mueller ties you to the corruption and you resign in disgrace. Your policies are destroying public education. Just resign now 
Reading the list of programs you’re cutting broke me. Does my 17yo autistic have no value or merit in your rich privileged entitled world?
Is he lesser than because he is different? Is he without value because he has a disability? Is he disposable because he’s not “normal”?
My son is also Austistic and requires an IEP. She picked the wrong parents to fight with.
She has no concept of how vicious we can be fighting for our kids and their programs.
Hey Betsy,

Charter schools, formed to offer a better alternative to failing public schools, are among the nation's most segregated. http://apne.ws/A5kKilj 
DeVos voucher plan would exacerbate educational inequality | TheHill

How many pencils did you steal or break during your visit?   Did you have your brother map the place to destroy it later? #resign

This Thanksgiving there appears to be a War on Education 
The Tax Bill would:
1—Kill the tax break for student loans,
2—Vastly increase taxes on graduate students,…
Resign.
@BetsyDeVosED you don’t care about student success. You care about your money. Such a fake person, I don’t know how you live with yourself.
I am just sorry I missed the protest!!  I would love to talk to you about how Corinthian Colleges ruined my credit with my worthless degree!!
lol. Surprised they let your ass in.
NO:
GOP war on education
Why have Trump & the GOP declared war on education? Their tax bill:
1) Kills tax break for student loans
2) Raises taxes on grad students
3) Taxes employer tuition assistance…
I’m curious to hear what Betsy DeVos’ plans are to rebuild our educational system. I was extremely excited when she was selected to head the DOE, because I believe that she is the person who will succeed at improving our schools!!!    Her
You stripped away provisions that protected sped kids.What will you say when you get before Jesus?  That they were expendable?  http://Shame.On.YOU

Help my classroom. Make a donation to my project. Any amount will help and is appreciated.

This tax bill has had very low public support, but that'll surely change once people find out that while their local taxes to support their kids' public schools are no longer fully deductible, wealthy families can now get huge tax breaks for private school tuition.
How’s your bro doing?
You're an unqualified hack who bought that job. Resign.
Sec Ed. Proof that bribery is legal if done correctly.
Don’t get comfortable. You’ll be gone when Trump is removed.
Oh @realDonaldTrump is staying for 8 more years and DeVos are going to remove that disgusting Title 9 and make education great again! #MAGA
Trump won’t win the nomination
I know Republican party are full of #Cuckservatives while Trump is the least RightWing Republican President in the modern time He should win
Whoever helps America long term will and stop China from finishing “One Belt, One Road”
Well Trump is in support of Taiwan rather then PRC Which is great for Freedom and democracy and stop P.R. China long term  #MAGA
You should be ashamed of yourself.  You are deplorable.
Traitor
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You are the most unqualified person to ever be appointed. You need to resign. You're making a fool of yourself
How about helping defrauded Corinthian College students whose lives have been screwed over by debt from worthless degrees???
We don't want big government dictating what our kids should learn it's out of control! Create competition and bigger ideas will come, make it fair for all families I want my kids money to follow my kid!

Quit trying to ruin the US public education system
Thank you for working tirelessly and without a paycheck to boot! Your efforts do not go unnoticed we appreciate all that you do! Parents know best!

So many, many people hate what you're doing and what you represent.
You’re just a scam artist lady
Hey Bets. Keep bibles out of schools. Thanks.
As a teacher and an atheist, I have no issue with bible's in school. As long as the school itself does not endorse and prosthylyze.
I am against teaching creationism and actively proselytize. If they do, I demand they let us teach science during Church Service.
All I can say, is open the door to religious bullshit in the classroom, and I will give you a generation that laughs at their gullibility.
I appreciate your optimism on the matter but even If I saw it that way, for me is a matter of teaching what is sensible,logic and rational
I teach physics by the mandated curriculum. I dare them to mandate I teach biblical bullshit. Kids spot bullshit a mile away.
RESIGN.
Dear BetsyDeVos. Sorry you’re getting creamed on Twitter.. I recommend a direct attack on communist teachers and teaching in gov schools. Make a hit.
honestly,,, you really look mature and decent

devos is a clueless  rich BIGOT, she know nothing of schools, she had her way paid through it, #StopHarmingChildren

Resign immediately. You are an embarrassment.
I heard you'll be resigning? Are you also being investigated?
You should definitely resign with dignity and America would thank you.  Education depends on your resignation.
And our taxpayers should go to 275 student charter schools that pay CEO salaries? Puhleeze. No.
http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/education/amp/Small-Houston-charter-school-pays-top-dollar-to-12332395.php …

To be fair, Betsy, I think you are one of the few people in this administration with actual beliefs, who actually does work.
I am opposed to your entire ideology of education, but I think you are coming from a place where you want to help and think that will help.
I suspect on your cross country tour you met a lot of people who weren't very nice. It would be great if you learned something from that.
Hey Bets, have you resigned yet? I hear it's coming. You suck and it sounds like even you know it! Props for being self-aware.
I would like to thank you.

for resigning. #maga
Betsy is proof that MONEY can buy a job but MONEY can't buy intelligence and class.  INCOMPETENT AND CLUELESS.
Why not do you [ #USA & #EU ] decide to propose an education law that includes "SOS: firearm injuries” ¿?

Betsy MAGA and save our children from lunatics who teach there are 4 genders, not just male and female.
Betsy our babies have been hijacked takeing away from them what makes this nation great for some liberal sell out the US agenda.
Being unable to deduct student loan interest from taxes will INCREASE taxes for millions of Americans.

Teachers would lose a $250 deduction for classroom materials under the GOP tax bill. http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/teacherbeat/2017/11/under_gop_bill_teachers_would_lose_$250_tax_deduction_classroom_materials.html?cmp=soc-edit-tw … #GOPTaxPlan 



Is that you seated back in coach @BetsyDeVosED?

Teachers spend nearly $1,000 a year on supplies. Under the GOP tax bill, they will no longer get a tax deduction. https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/education/wp/2017/11/02/teachers-spend-nearly-1000-a-year-on-supplies-under-the-gop-tax-bill-they-will-no-longer-get-a-tax-deduction/ …
Betsy I believe you have the hardest and most important of jobs.
Heard you were resigning soon? Today is a good day. It will save our education system from your utter failure. #Resign #DeVosIsUnqualified
Go away
Its time to go Betsy. Buh bye
IF ONLY AMERICAN STUDENTS WOULD SHOW THE SAME RESPECT AND APPRECIATION! LOTS OF WORK NEEDED TO TURN AROUND 8 YEARS OF OBAMA, GODSPEED!

You were never ever qualified for the job. Just like Trump isn’t qualified for his either.


You are a two faced witch- you are eliminating student loan forgiveness on needy ppl - what a freak

The end is near. Do the right thing and step down.
Qualified professionals don't need coaching. Just ask anyone that's ever had to work for a living. @BetsyDeVosED
"I think I was undercoached": Betsy DeVos blames the Trump transition team for its handling of her confirmation http://politi.co/2A8osX6  
Everybody hates you, and you're terrible at your job. #QUIT
You know what would really help our education, more extra curriculum activities. It would help kids stay off the street.
If you needed to be coached on the basics you should not have been considered for the job!
JEEZ PEOPLE REALLY DO HATE YOU. ACKNOWLEDGE IT SIMPLETON.
Is your brother still murdering foreigners for money?


Every department is DESTROYING the regulations designed to protect the vulnerable, the poor, the disabled, the sick. #Reprehensible 
W/ no thanks to your incompetence at DESTROYING our schools and children's futures! I see you ONLY go to PROFIT charter schools! FOR SHAME!
you suck! You are NOT amazing!
What don't you understand about the separation of church and state? #Swamp
Looks like it's going to be an early Christmas for the Devos family this year.
#BREAKING: Trump admin may reverse Obama rule erasing debt of students at fraudulent for-profit colleges: report http://hill.cm/LwCJUf4  
you're the WURST.
This is priceless since you are doing everything you can to help students fail.  If you had any morals or conscience, you'd resign.
Still haven’t found a profit incentive for visiting a #publicschool ?
You should be ashamed of yourself. How can you honestly believe you are helping any American child with this system? #Trader

Dear @BetsyDeVosED,Please view and reply to: http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal … Emailed @usedgov 
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse please assist - thanks! 

So this job is a vacation? We knew you don't want to work so quit
Inept. Hated. Dangerous. Please give our children a bright future by stepping down.
Why are you not stopping Gov of MS from partnering with Kellogg's Foundation?
Evil.
OMG #America is truly in deep deep trouble . Stripping away the rights of disabled children with a fake smile.
Thanks for threatening the education of special needs children and staff. We see you.

Raise your hand if you despise Betsy.  https://apple.news/APgo7gviITRamIS94BQ4GWA …
I hope you’re strong enough at the end because it won’t be pretty.
I don’t care what kind of power you have, but at the end, Karma will bite you hard for not standing up the American people. You’re a fraud.
If I were you, I would start praying because I wonder what God thinks of you since you’ve disgraced the disability and assaults rights.
You completely just screwed over students with disabilities! How do you even look at yourself in the mirror? #Horrible #NoCare #HumanRights #RightsToEducation

Yes! She can not change the constitution! Handicapped kids have the right to a FREE PUBLIC APPROPRIATE EDUCATION
Hopefully, there are no students with disabilities at that school, because you are certainly no friend to them.

#PublicEducation
Stop pretending like you care about children.
Despicable Betsy!
@usedgov @AASCU @CollegeBoard As initiative nationwide colleges and universities which abide by SAT and @ACT now to institutionally select.
You rolled back protections for transgender students, sexual assault victims, & kids with disabilities. So only wealthy kids get to succeed?
Is oppressing girls by hijab and burqas permitted in public schools? This video is disturbing!
. @BetsyDeVosED is working against public school teachers & everything they stand for. She strips students of their rights as she smiles.
You are one of the most evil cabinet members/member of Trump’s villainous cabal because you target disenfranchised children.
They’re helping students succeed?  I’d think you’d be against them.  All of your policies and actions certainly are...
Did Trumplethinskin give you direct orders to ruin public education?
I heard your finances are being scrutinized, and you might be going to prison soon. Is that true?
Let’s pray it is! This woman is EVIL!
You are despicable and only out for yourself . Clearly you rescinded 72 guidance documents for disabled . Disgusting
Hard to believe anyone worse than Trump, but here she is: Betsy Devos is the worst.
When Evangelical Christian Schools did horribly on standardized tests, Vicious DeVos exempted to cover-up that fact.
*Unless you are disabled
when will you be removing policies protecting minorities victimized by hate crimes in schools?
Can you explain why you hate special needs children? Is it just that you have no soul?
But not the special ed kids. Dont help them. Right?
Do you know the way to San Juan?
Karma will come to you one day.  With interest from all the special ed kids you stole from
History will NOT be kind to you DeVos.
You have absolutely no credentials to be in your position except for your pocket book. Surely no intelligence.
All the while you are rescinding the rights of disabled students 72 to be exact.  You are as pathetic as that con artist sitting in the WH.
Didn’t this bitch just rescind a bunch of regulations supporting students with disabilities? Heartless.
you are shameful and evil...taking away guidelines for handicapped rights??? how do you sleep at night. EVIL personified. Pawn in the game.

Why do you hate and attach autistic children?
You should be ashamed to make education policy. You are a rich person with no business doing what you are doing. Shame. Shame. Shame.
Individual students needs??  Really?
Unfortunately @BetsyDeVosED has no interest in helping students w/ disabilities succeed. You have unleashed the fury of millions of parents!
You are destroying the education system through your ignorance and what you are doing is disgusting. You are totally unqualified.  Resign!
YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH EDUCATION.
YOU SUCK BETSY ENDING HELP FOR DISABLED STUDENTS - YOU AND YOUR BROTHER GETTING READY FOR HOLY WAR.. RESIGN.
You should do with most of the trumpet administration is going to eventually end up doing? resigning! You & Trump National embarrassments!
Only non disabled students tho am I right?
Betsy DeVos has rescinded 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students. http://wapo.st/2xdvurM 
Why are you killing the abilities of special needs parents to provide the best care for their children? Do you hate disabled?
You are the worst person for this job. You are already fucking shit up! Leave, resign, whatever, you have no idea what you're doing.
Saw what you did to the disabled.  Keep doing the Lord's work, Betsy.  I'm sure He's super proud.  :P  NOT!
So, probably not your brightest idea to pick a fight with the parents of disabled kids.
You commend Students that don’t have special needs. What about those with special needs? They shouldn’t succeed? You take their rights away.

DeVos rescinds 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students
Reminder that Betsy Devos not only doesn't care about students/education, she is cruel & heartless. #fuckbetsydevos
My autistic son thanks you, Trump and 3rd party voters.

DeVos rescinds documents outlining rights for disabled kids http://wapo.st/2gWan7l?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.a5c1a862f7f2 …
No, no... You don't get to act like you care. Not after this bullshit: https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/education/wp/2017/10/21/devos-rescinds-72-guidance-documents-outlining-rights-for-disabled-students/ …
If you care about school success, why are you undermining students with disabilities?! Shame on you. #wwjd?
Figures a bullshit artist like Trump nominates this this hack, who has never attended or sent her kids to public schools.
She lied to Congress and misstated the online learning graduation rates. Only reason she got the job was she helped #TrumpRussia with data.
First sexual assault victims and now she rescinds disabled student rights. This woman is beyond disgusting. Woman is a fraud.
AGREED SHE HAS GOT TO GO!
What exactly do have against kids w/disabilities? I only want to know b/c I have a son w/autism who is in a great school w/great program.
Only because he is protected under the constitution! This evil uneducated witch wants to take that away. http://eduptcwwwp01.ed.gov/policy/speced/reg/eo13777/eo13777-osers-outdated-guidance-list-20171002.pdfhttp://eduptcwwwp01.ed.gov/policy/speced/reg/eo13777/eo13777-osers-outdated-guidance-list-20171002.pdf …
