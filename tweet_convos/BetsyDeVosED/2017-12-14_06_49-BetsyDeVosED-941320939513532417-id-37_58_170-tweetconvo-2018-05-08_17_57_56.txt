You know what keeps Special Ed students from falling through the cracks? Enforcing IDEA and following the 72 guidance docs that YOU effing rescinded! And having OCR involvement in cases where disabled students rights are being violated, but @realDonaldTrump ended that! 
For CruellaDeVos, “personal touch” is taking lunches away from poor children and promoting her religion at the expense of #PublicSchools4America. Her crusade against education for ALL, is straight from the 1300’s. Creationism anyone?
Sometimes it takes a personal touch? I'm a teacher. The correct wording is, "usually" it takes a personal touch.
You let 98,000 students fall through the cracks, and then you paved over them to hide the bodies. #DischargeTheDebt Honor your commitments.
He just discovered that? Wow!  How did he get his job as a teacher, let alone a college president if he’s just becoming aware of that?
Ugh. You people need to stop tweeting out vague statements. #RethinkUSEDGOV #FAIL
If only...
Give me a break people. You just keep proving that @usedgov under @BetsyDeVosED is an incompetent joke. The agenda being pushed is 3/
@BetsyDeVosED but promoting private/charter schools does NOTHING to address these simplistic issues that are being tweeted. 2/
@BetsyDeVosED OK for real. These things are PAINFULLY OBVIOUS to those of us who actually work in schools every day. 1/
But the modern public education system needs to acknowledge computer’s exist instead of relying on the pencil sharpener!
Then get Betsy out of there.
Betsy’s personal touch from Americans: leave our country, buy an island, and never come back.

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …
And resources.

"In college, of course, students have to flourish without constant supervision. Although charter students are admitted to college at higher rates than students from comparable public schools, their graduation rates are dispiritingly low."  http://ow.ly/qs4k30hb1B4

We should be using tech with the focus to improve our reach and contact to support our students
The cracks became craters when DeVoss was put in charge of Education. The woman is poison to our children and teachers

If All the educated would Stop, Think & Realize; It is More about the Heart of man First, then All other things would be in harmony;Love, respect, character, morality, Charater, honor, dignity & integrity.The Spirit man Needs spiritual food for his spirit to be at Peace

I should add that I'm sure there are caring, intelligent people working at @usedgov and I shouldn't lump everyone into one category.
@BetsyDeVosED transparent and shameful. Get out of your bubble and away from the yes-men and listen to actual educators. /end
Absolutely!
Someone gets it!
Wowwww. What a brilliant observation. 
They can't wire a plug to plug themselves in.
Almost everything can be solved by computer except unpredictable nature. Live with nature, play with nature and die with nature.
