The vast majority of Americans can't afford college anymore without taking on crippling debt. A debt that you gave out and gave two thumbs up, even when it's given with intent of fraud.
That's the point. You should already have a trade before you go to college, in order to pay for college.

HVAC/plumbing/electrical/roofing do not require "degrees". Almost nothing actually needs a degree.
That doesn't make sense for all career spectrums, not for individuals who work digitally or those that are programmers. And at this point you could work for years and not have the money to pay for college. It's about 38,000 A YEAR. That's leaving kids with a 152,000 price tag.

WOW, NOT ENOUGH YOU ARE CAUSING THE FAILURE OF EDUCATION IN THE US, NOW LEGALIZING THE FALSE UNIVERSITY FRAUD FOR ILLEGAL UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOLS FOR A WORTHLESS EDUCATION.  YOU BELONG IN JAIL WITH trump
Most states have waiting list for kids trying to get into trade schools. Nore money should be spent in increasing the amount of trade schools especially in urban/suburban areas.
They want your children to go to college only to fill their coffers and keep your children in debt
All students are not destined for college, more emphasis should be put into trade schools where there is more of a guarantee of a career, even with only a trade school diploma. The trades are what built this country

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …

Register to vote. Get two friends registered to vote. Throw a voter registration party. 

At the end of the day, this administration is bad for you, it’s bad for us,…
No one cares what you think
@BetsyDeVosED  We would agree especially in consideration of building human capital for the long term sustainability of our nation.

"In college, of course, students have to flourish without constant supervision. Although charter students are admitted to college at higher rates than students from comparable public schools, their graduation rates are dispiritingly low."  http://ow.ly/qs4k30hb1B4 
consider the à la carte college approach- learn what u need- build your specialization- no more degree glass ceiling- humanities are important, but not every career pathway needs an intro to psychology

#SandyHook was 5 years ago. Nothing has changed
This is why distance and adult Ed should be embedded within college departments, not segregated #lifelonglearning
Not quite sure why you think this iscnews. "Learning for life" has been a thing for ages.
