That’s really great this private school that doesn’t represent the general public (mostly white students) were privileged enough to have those opportunities which allowed this recognition.
This is a public school.  3 different high school campuses in the district are able to send students to the BCTAL campus for additional learning opportunities.
Actually this is a group of schools in the Birdsville Independent District that are public, private and charter. The one she’s visiting isn’t public. Guess you didn’t read the eligibility form? https://www.birdvilleschools.net/cms/lib/TX01000797/Centricity/Domain/6766/1819OpenEnrollmentWebInfo.pdf …
That form is for open transfer students who are wanting to come to Birdville ISD. Students who go to the 3 high schools in the PUBLIC school district take courses at this magnet school in the career and technology program. This magnet school is apart of the PUBLIC school district
It’s not a magnet school. It’s just another campus.  There is no application to take classes at that campus.
Didn’t say it was a magnet school, said it is not a public school and please don’t respond without reading their enrollment process. I even posted the link for you. It’s apparent you haven’t read it otherwise you’d have seen that you do have to apply  in order to take classes,
This is a public school.
Always good to see the young women in science and technology, and the basics of mechanical engineering and physics. ISO standards appreciated. Julie Ann Racino, Rome Science Academy, 2018  STEM Education

@BetsyDeVosED is unqualified.
DeVos doesn’t care about public education. She doesn’t visit them and her school Choice initiative is taking public edu funds and giving it to private schools. #ResignDeVos
Again, Birdville ISD is public.

@BetsyDeVosED DeVos's ultimate objective is to end public education in the U.S. She does not want people to learn. She wants people to be ignorant, especially about science & history. Indoctrination of biblical literalism is the only kind of "education" she truly supports.

Looks like Mueller's got Betsy DeVos' brother, Erik Prince, on national security crimes and perjurin' himself before Congress.

The real irony for Betsy Devos is that our kids are gonna study about…


An internal Education Department report shows that Secretary Betsy DeVos inquired about prosecuting employees who leaked information to news outlets. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/04/04/education-secretary-betsy-devos-asked-if-leakers-could-be-prosecuted-internal-report-shows/?utm_term=.5f2fcf026e1b&wpisrc=nl_daily202&wpmm=1 …
Great! step by step!

Birdville ISD serves Haltom City- "As of the census of 2010, there were 42,409 people and 16,626 households in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 69.8% White..." NOT DALLAS.
As our Creator intended, He created us in His image and likeness to be creators doing His will on earth as it is in heaven, children of GOD; Good, Acceptable and perfect, Blessed to be a blessing to others fulfilling our lives in Joy, love and peace; the kingdom of GOD on earth.
Betsy DeVos is a class act! I love her, I love her poise, her composure when dealing with the foaming at the mouth savages of the left! CHOICE & VOUCHERS all the way to freedom from the death spiral of the liberal indoctrination centers AKA public schools!
