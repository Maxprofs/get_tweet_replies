There was NO consensus among twitter users even close to what you’re claiming. The focus MUST always be properly funding public education in order to strengthen the system and allowing for the best teachers to teach students in modernized ways. 

You are so backward.
One key skill they must learn is...HOW to learn AND to LOVE learning throughout life. #RethinkSchool
In other words: How can we help the .01% make even more money on testing?
Please stop confusing skills with content.
You are unqualified.  #Resign
#EndCommonCore then, because it is ruining American education. Obviously it is a failure. Instead of getting rid of it, schools & colleges are lowering standards.
End Common Core
@BetsyDeVosED what a tone deaf comment. #captainobvious
But in Texas all our kids do is prepare for the STAAR tests. Our teachers are robots and are told what to provide. Both student and teachers are prevented from reaching there full potential.
Wow. That’s brilliant. #CruellaDeVos just defined Education. Who would have guessed that she had the key to success? Next: College is a good idea.

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …
We talk to manufacturing employers everywhere, they all say the same thing, even though we teach technical skills, they are in dire need of the soft-skills we teach...more so than the technical, someone who can read a watch, calendar, someone who can take instruction, etc...

"In college, of course, students have to flourish without constant supervision. Although charter students are admitted to college at higher rates than students from comparable public schools, their graduation rates are dispiritingly low."  http://ow.ly/qs4k30hb1B4

That’s the difference. Expectations must be raised across the board. Actual practice and memorization must be used.
"Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it." Maybe don't cut history classes for American students.
If All the educated would Stop, Think & Realize; It is More about the Heart of man First, then All other things would be in harmony;Love, respect, character, morality, Charater, honor, dignity & integrity.The Spirit man Needs spiritual food for his spirit to be at Peace
Seriously. Next you guys are going to tell me that self-reflection is important. Good thing I've got @usedgov @BetsyDeVosED to fill me in. 
@BetsyDeVosED No way! You mean I can't just drone on all day and not worry about whether kids are learning? So profound. I'm shook.
So why are you still teaching so many skills that were valuable in the previous century, but useless now!
Betsy when we have someone who has the credentials running the education Dept we will have a leader to teach education and listen. You my dear are just making money from your companies that go after student loans. Your a joke. You’ve raped the education Dept for your own profit
Betsy DeVos is incapable of learning how hated she is amongst the American people.
