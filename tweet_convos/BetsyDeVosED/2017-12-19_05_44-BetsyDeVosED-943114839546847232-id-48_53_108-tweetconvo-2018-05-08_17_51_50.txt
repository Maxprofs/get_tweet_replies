Did you see that 16y/o who was just admitted to Harvard thanks to the education he received through the voucher program. I see your point is to keep minorities uneducated. 
Actually not, and that is what dummies who can’t form an actual intelligent argument do, deflect.  And you seem like a REAL miserable person so you keep on resisting while the rational lot of us laugh.
Roll out that voucher program already! #SchoolChoice #MAGA
Why not? I teach myself, and school choice will help students who are smart and motivated in poor underperforming schools.
The day this woman dies , is the day students & our future kids will have it easier
This woman has never worked a day in education in her life. She bought this position with her massive political donations to the @SenateGOP, and now taxpayers foot a $8 million bill for her contrived photo ops
She is unqualified. Get her outta here.
Michigan. For Profit Schools. Title IX. You’ve already shown how you #rethinkschool and it #Sucks. #rethinkDeVos #BuyAJobBetsy

A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …
Her necklace costs more than the average yearly salary of a teacher.
Stop trying to destroy our public schools. Why not try getting educated as to what happens. It will slap you in the face as to how hard we all work for any kid. No child should be left behind or forgotten. Maybe money shouldn't matter to you, selfish on your part.
Sleazy person in charge of public education who knows nothing about education who lacks a degree.... wow! Pathetic can't way to get you all out of power.

Register to vote. Get two friends registered to vote. Throw a voter registration party. 

At the end of the day, this administration is bad for you, it’s bad for us,…
Support public education
Oh look another GOP #paytoplay #lackey
The smartest thing DeVos ever did, was get smart educators together, let them speak and not say a word.
.@BetsyDeVosED LOVED the first speaker, brought tears to my eyes. Learner centered education. Whole child development. Partnering with families. Yes! We should expect more from our educational institutions.


Not only is @BetsyDeVosED not qualified to be Sec. of Education, she also awarded a student loan debt collection contract to a company she has a financial interest in. How is this not a conflict of interest? Our students deserve better. #CA39 #PhilForHouse …

Publish a list of all educators who have a record of sex abuse
I’d rather be struck by lightning than listen to that dumbass talk
Looking forward to watching this later.  I deeply appreciate and respect @BetsyDeVosED !  #MAGA
The Liberal Arts Curriculum Indoctrination of public education has not worked since removal of God & Prayer from schools. Kids are taught the way of the devil, darkness of evil & destruction with hearts of Hate. The Heart must be established on God, Good & Life w/love & Respect
Put God back in school & focus on academics & God will bless tremendously! Children will learn morals & respect & humility!
Uh oh
Has @BetsyDeVosED not resigned yet?  We need an educator in charge of education.
Paper bag please!
How many more people boo you at this one?
This is great news! We would love to have you come here to Clay County Florida!
bet that the lack of support for black kids & girls won't even be subtle this time 'round....nope, no need to bother.....its okay to be a sexist, racist & just downright ignorant now, isn't it Betsy?
No one cares Betsy. Your of no use to improving education in any direction. You bought your seat at the table that in no way brings credit to you and the skill set you lack to do your job.
End Common Core
Betsy Devos needs to resign.  Our children and public schools deserve better!
Education needs to be about students getting most from education; NOT tenure, pensions, all focus on teachers for votes  #Senate #Congress
This robotic woman speaking should be interesting. It is a good thing she inherited money, her educated is a slight on the school system.
So, are we "rethinking" having schools at all or just who should get to attend them?
WHY?

She is getting rid of supports for MY SON!!!!

#Resign
Betsy hasn’t rethought a damn thing in her life. Buy an island and never come back!
