So you'll be in my neighborhood. I gave up caffeine a week ago so no coffee after for me but I'll do a decafe tea & we'll chat.
You do know you are the anti Christ of the education system? Opportunity all while you r slashing these peoples budgets? REALLY? #disgusted
Thank you for visiting Omaha!  #schoolchoice Parents need opportunity to CHOOSE what school is best for the kiddos, NOT the zip code.
Please bring civics classes back K-12 & college. The book "The Big Lie" by Dinesh D'Souza should be part of required History reading in HS
Liberal Teacher Unions will never allow anything that counters their brainwashing narrative!
bullshit! Liberal education is about critical thinking - not burning books and censorship - bring it on .. bring it on .. stop lying
Hey Bets, just thought of one more."YOU ARE FAKE NEWS!!" Look up a hurricane may drop a house on you with a bucket of water for good measure
Literally no one thinks you should have this job. Your policies are disgraceful & you're a walking bag of corruption. Have fun on your tour!

Dear @BetsyDeVosED,Please view and reply to: http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal … Emailed @usedgov 
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse please assist - thanks! 
Have you considered visiting successful schools in states that did not vote for Donald Trump? I find your choices to be rather biased.
#Unqualified #unresearched #racist #dogma.#Resign and go back to your religious fundamentalist compound.



I'm pleased to see you're out there doing a great job. Thank you for working to improve our school systems.

Great job on Fox this morning!! Please get out there more!  We need to hear your message!  We have no trust in schools anymore = liberals!!
Most noble & best trained? They're jaded by years of summer jobs and 7yrolds. Bullying children, humiliation as teaching tools. Sick.
Great schools Coming soon, thank you Secretary DeVos!  


What are you even doing? A tour, photo ops at tiny tables w tiny humans? Get rid of common core already. Show some progress! #rethinkbetsy
tell the guys it;s ok to rape and young girls to just expect to be raped bc the state is ok with it love @BetsyDeVosED
Not today, Satan.

#RethinkDeVos ... You're not qualified. Quit.
Big improvement over 2016 Washington DC Public Schools student proficiency numbers of 25%! Obama must be so proud! Please shut them down!
Washington DC Public Schools proficiency numbers of 30% are dismal! Please have Fairfax schools take over the district ASAP!

Nice 2 see u on FOX #ReThinkSchool very concerned abt teacher classroom brainwashing, now looking at 1 on 1 w pupil!
How convenient you avoided St. Louis, Chicago, Memphis, Detroit, and the like.  You don't really care about education.
This says it all!
Which part is actually a choice? When you destroy public education and people have NO choice except for going to public schools?
Please spare us the disappointment of further recaps. When you do your job and SUPPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLS then I'll care
No. 
You need to check out of your position as head of the dept of ed. You are a joke.
This is great, thank you for an in-depth look at what you've been up to.
It is nice to find exceptional schools. Your task is to scale this up for 50 million students.

Yeah Betsy get the he'll out of education and let parents decide what's best for their children, make parents parent again. Govt screws up!
Great to see you in Fox &Friends. More charters. More innovation. More differentiation. More American history and civics.
My profession is facing extinction

Is the goal education or segregation?Here's how great your experiment worked out in Holland, MI:
Resign immediately
Check out this article about how school choice leads to school segregation:
Betsy DeVos doesn't have the qualifications to be a teacher's aide in many states, yet she thinks she knows enough to be the Secretary of Ed
Doesn't the ability to rethink require the ability to think? I'd ask about that if I were you, since you do not have that ability!
Do any of these private, charter, and parochial schools accept and appropriately educate special needs students? #IDEA Google it!
Hey Bets! Heard you're visiting charter schools in IN today... why won't you visit our public schools like Penn Harris schools?
You know nothing about education. No experience. No qualifications. If somebody must #rethinkschool, let it be teachers, not billionaires.
Hard pass
I'm glad tax payer dollars funded this trip to visit private schools.
You suck
This "tour" is a ridiculous waste of taxpayer $. Only necessary bc u have no clue what real educators do. You're a joke.
When are you going tohelp the kids in public schools #StopIslam #StopCommonCore #HomeSchool your kids You haven't done anything for the kids
Amazing how much time you have to tweet. What about TX schools? #devosshame #unfit
#ReThinkBetsyDeVos
I am very disappointed that you have Federal monies to move your personal agenda forward at the cost of American students. #DeVosEffect
Well, the committee denied the education budget of her slashing public ed to fund her failed pet project.
I wonder what poor intern has to monitor her twitter... #RethinkDeVos and get a job in real education.
#endcommoncore
Why?
Please resign. You do not care about our students one bit. If you have any decency in you, quit now.





I know you gave up so much to do what you're doing. Thank you so much, I'm confident you can improve our school system.

Self Realization is spontaneous happening-the inner awakening of residual force within us called KUNDALINI,the reflection of the Holy Ghost
You didn't earn the seat you bought it. #unqualified #RethinkDeVos. @realDonaldTrump promise to drain, not fill #swamp. You are the #swamp.
#SahajaYoga Once one experiences Self-Realization,one gets a new dimension of awareness. One becomes aware of the state of the subtle system
RETHINK:
- buying a cabinet position
- pushing religious agenda
- promoting what profits you financially
- pretending to be an educator
You should do education a favor and quit.  ReThink your ability to do this job.
