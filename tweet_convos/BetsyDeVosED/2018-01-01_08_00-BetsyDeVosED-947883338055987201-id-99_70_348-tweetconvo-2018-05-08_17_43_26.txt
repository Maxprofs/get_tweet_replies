A company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected Thursday by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans. The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/11/education-dept-awards-debt-collection-contract-to-company-with-ties-to-devos/?hpid=hp_rhp-more-top-stories_debt-devos-430pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8fde9ab248ff …
Fuckyou and thefatfuckingmoron that  calls himself president. You are both shitholes
Listen.....can you hear the corruption?

UGH
You selected Performant, a company you invested in before becoming Secretary, and now stand to gain handsomely? @BetsyDeVosED conflict of interest!
It is not a good year if U R passing out contracts paid by taxpayers that are a "conflict of interest." If you R, is Trump getting his CUT?

Wow, is anyone else outraged @BetsyDeVosED and her husbands investment company own interests in Performant who magically were awarded 1 of 2 Federal Student Loan Debt Collection Contracts worth nearly $400MM....
More DeVos corruption:
Happy New Year 
Brenda how are you today
Suggestion: Offer inexpensive online college classes nationwide for under graduate classes with low cost test centers.  1. You will eliminate college debt for these students, 2. You will look like a champion for the poor, 3. You will remove the funds that propel the liberals
You must be joking! Have you looked at the state of education in this country?
I hear kids in Missouri have no heat in their classrooms. What are you gonna do about that?
Baltimore city as well... #corrupt @BetsyDeVosED
Here’s one of your charter schools. The sadistic father who kept his 13 kids captive is listed as the principal.

Not only is @BetsyDeVosED not qualified to be Sec. of Education, she also awarded a student loan debt collection contract to a company she has a financial interest in. How is this not a conflict of interest? Our students deserve better. #CA39 #PhilForHouse …
@BetsyDeVosED you’re a crook, and I hope for the sake of our dept of education you leave your post ASAP.

Happy New Year Madam Secretary! May 2018 be the year you have time to meet with us and see the future of Manufacturing Education. Have been trying to schedule a meeting for over a year, I suspect you are unaware of that :-)
UGH, make our wish come true...STEP DOWN NOW
@BetsyDeVosED
The brother of Mercenary former murderous Blackwater want their new mercenary branches to be fully funded by our government, Bitsy wants collection companies she invests in,w/ less xp/rating 2 take education loans....How corrupt is this family?  NOT Christians, but crooks
You are worse than unqualified, you are a destructive force in American education.

Happy Birthday, @BetsyDeVosED!  Thank you so much for your service to our country.  Hoping you had a great day and the year ahead is your best ever.  God bless you. #MAGA
Oh, my... It is even spelled correctly...!  #stupidcow


To you, yours & Your big goals for our kids to_o Ma'am!_!
Wishing you a heart and new knowledge of what teachers, students, and adminstrators need in this country. Where is the equity? Get some help. You are failing to lift up educational access for all! #MoneyBoughtYourJob
Without the College Student Loan Forgiveness Program this country would not have as many high quality employees in Gov’t agencies. Graduates must take the higher paying jobs in the private sector to pay off these loans. They will not be able to work for less in the public sector.
It is not going to be a Happy New Year for people that have been working with various Gov’t agencies at lower than market wages to qualify for the student loan forgiveness after 10 years. My son has 8 years accrued w/State of TX school for disabled. He’s earning loan forgiveness.

Happy Birthday!!

Will we see the end of common core. That would be a happy new year.
What a fool you are.
You do not support education in any way. Sad!

Why do you hate children?
I'm sure you do wish everyone a happy new year....all the money you're collecting
WHY ARE CHILDREN FREEZING IN CLASSROOMS
great job,HYPOCRITE....
Quit. Just go home.
I can't help but notice you do a lot of retweeting. Is that because you can't read read or write? Does someone help you select the retweets?
Awakened to be enlightened !  You are not educated without excellence. Path 117 -Tellispectragence Junpoli ( The Free World and Your Abundant Harvest )  in progress ...
You don't mean that
#DumpDeVosIn2018
It won’t be happy or productive with destructive fanaticism in charge at the D of E.
It would be a happy and productive year if you got rid of Betty!
You Ms DeVos need to resign! You are the worse Sec of Education! You know zilch about the public school system or how to treat students with respect
Happy New Year! Why don’t people understand that a charter school is a public school?
Ok @BetsyDeVosED it’s 2018! U’ve had long enough So, when ru going to get to work?!? How about getting rid of “Common Core”?!? How about hold some of the criminal teachers accountable?!? How about teacher selection?!?
@MarkYoungTruth @SheriffClarke @VP
@BetsyDeVosED @usedgov resign!
#EndCommonCore 
ASAP
You don't mean it because you're mean.
@BetsyDeVos , stay out of our education!
May our education system begin to teach& train up our children in Character, Respect, Discipline, Righteousness with Love for one another; The missing ingredient in the liberal arts curriculum indoctrination as demonstrated in our culture, K-12, Campuses & society. Change diet
Happy New Year! Enjoy progress, and the complaints of hater losers trying to stop progress.
Was our 2017 putting you on blast not enough, Betsy? 2018: we're turning the screw harder.
Stop the liberal brainwashing of our children.
You're f*kcing kidding me, right? Understand this and understand it clearly ---> you WILL NOT DISMANTLE PUBLIC EDUCATION & institute religious based curriculum. It's won't happen unless you want to cause a civil war. You need to evaluate your agenda before it's too late. #Resist
hear me well -- you're blocked -- potty-mouth follower of the 'haters and fools' movement
it will be if @BetsyDeVosED steps down and is replaced with someone that values education over profits.
Stop making education more inaccessible. @BetsyDeVosED has made predatory practices ok in higher ed with for profit colleges. Has made it easier for sexual predators in schools. The degradation of our Dept of Ed starts at the head. #DeVosEffect
Removing money from the department of education will force state and local governments to do for themselves not rely on fed tax money.If the states were not mired in currupion and union's thay could take care of it themselvs.
We need to get rid of the dept of education.The fed gov has no business involving themselves in public education.State and local governments and parents should be in charge
As far as I know, sate and local governments are in charge of most aspects of schooling. However, there are huge discrepancies between states in the quality of education, and that's where federal-level involvement might be useful.
End common core, & teach students that Maxism Communism Socialism are a big lie and by far the systems that have murdered people under their systems.
New Year should be in caps.
If educators and students are to be happy then Betsy DeVos needs to go. Her involvement shows how EDU can be bought with $ bribes to Trump.
The department of education is the problem.The states and local governments need to take charge.
State/local get most funds from federal & I don’t know of a school that hasn’t done continuous fundraising or could support off that alone!
Wasn’t that $9.4 billion Trump wants to cut from EDU after the House just cut $4.2 billion? Yeah real happy freak’n New Year.
Hopefully Trump will get rid of the Department of Education soon. The states should be able to maintain their own schools.
If this is true, replace the guidance you withdrew and ask @CivilRights to do the same.
