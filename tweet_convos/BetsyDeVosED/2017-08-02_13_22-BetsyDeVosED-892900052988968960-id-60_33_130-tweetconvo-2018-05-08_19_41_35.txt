Imagine sitting around all day just to tweet repetitive contrarian assertions/views. Could have read a book or two with that time. :)
I'm old.  I have 3 degrees. One is a JD.  I've read books.  There is a lot out there to know.  I'm just going to let someone else know it.
Good advice 'Spanish for Lawyer'. I'm aging, have 2 degrees (neither associated w/Law), also read books & let someone else know it (healthy)
There comes a point when an educated person realizes that the more they learn, the more there is out there they don't know.
Yes, and why we are not the only ones on our planet.

People who care abt their kids urge them to stay away from Betsy DeVos. She only wants $$$ ppl to be able to read.
How fitting she read "The Hungry Caterpillar" LOL. Money hungry is all Betsy has in her brain.
Probably the last book she ever picked up.

You. Are. PATHETIC. BetSY! SHAME ON YOU. YOU have again, sold your SOUL
I wish you were gone @BetsyDeVosED you haven't done anything for public schools what about Stopping Common Core Do is a favor Step down
How about teaching cursive writing to our children. I would hate the fact I could not read the original Declaration of Independence.
DeVos is encouraging literacy? Bitsy can barely spell.
@BetsyDeVosED Can kiss my ass. She's horrible for the country's future.
And beware of bears!

I hope you realize just how much you're hated in this country.
The folks criticizing/character assassinating this wonderful hard working woman? Are the most uneducated people here I'm seeing.#MAGA2020
Oh please, she is uneducated and has no clue how to teach.  Oh that's right it requires a higher degree than she has,
Betsy DeVil knows nothing about education. She got her job through nepotism and cronyism her opinion means very little. Let kids be free!
Language you used confused me... summer slide... much less kids!!
Another great photo op by our completely inept and unqualified Sec. of Ed who BOUGHT her position. Didn't earn it at all.
I am embarrassed that she's from my state. Forgive us, United States, she has no idea what she's doing.
its Aug 3 kinda of late to bring up summer reading..lol  maybe June
Unqualified bigot who bought her job!

A sobering look at what Betsy DeVos did to education in Michigan-and what she might do as secretary of education -

She's as beautiful as she is talented and compassionate. I'm with her
@BetsyDeVosED and then she defunded their public schools denying them books to read, I guess that would be the year long slide
Please advise us as to how we should discuss nuclear war with our children.
Maybe you should be opening some of those de-funded libraries then, love.....
You just look nuts.  sorry
She totally missed the point of he book. What to expect from person who grew up in a compound, bought her position &is utterly unqualified.

U R clueless re: pub ed, yet this comment comes from U? Not an original thought. Funding = resources =  nuture students 2 actually do this.
Hmmm.... waiting until August just a few weeks before school starts here in her hometown. #toolate
How could I be so DENSE!  #1 $$$, #2 children, # 3 spouse. Makes TOTAL SENSE,,,,that's the SHOE'S way. Seen it lived it. HALF TRUTH TELLERS!
American educators urge schools to avoid Betsy DeVos #RepealTrump #arresttrump #Education
How about u @BetsyDeVosED ....u should take ur own advice. Have u been reading education books this summer or too busy meeting with rapists?
Unfortunately a staged photo op does little to prevent summer slide.
Gee whiz, Bets, we didn't ALREADY KNOW THAT!!! 
You are kidding, right?
This is your pithy plan to improve American education?
@BetsyDeVosED @MLive   There's nothing more to be said about this mockery of a federal official
And then she urged them to get better, wealthier parents next time around.  Poor people are icky.
My son chose to read War and Peace this summer. His choice. Goes to private school. Have to find a way that kids want to read and learn.
Trump donates $100K to Dept of Ed. Only $9,199,900,000 to go to make up for his $9.2B in proposed education cuts.

DeVos refuses to say on sending her kids to Milwaukee voucher school. Just 2% proficient in math and 0% in English.
They would probably be too stupid to make it in a public school.
