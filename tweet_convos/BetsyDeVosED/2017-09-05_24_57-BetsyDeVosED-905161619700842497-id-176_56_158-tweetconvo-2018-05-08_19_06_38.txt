Do you mean college women too? Or are you just wishing the colleges guys a "fun" time! Thanks for throwing women under the bus!
Perhaps you should just go away!
It would be more successful if you weren't busy destroying our educational system to support a corrupt @potus.
Much more successful if you weren't destroying student's protection against rape.
Much more successful if you weren't more worried about grizzly bears than guns in schools.
Much more successful if you made student loan policies that protect students rather than line your wallet with big bank lobbyist money.
Students would do a lot better if you weren't in office, someone who knows NOTHING about real education.
@speaker Ryan please speak up for our children and grandchildren. No more common core, gender teaching pillars of Islam and white privileged
@SpeakerRyan won't speak up for anyone except those that are lining his pocket.
Yep. Hope all Rinos up for re election get voted out and replaced with someone who will work with Trump.
They will work with trump just like they worked with Obama.   True Republicans work together for the people not for corporations
Maybe stop trying to revoke Title IX protections you demon!!!
Removing protections for sexual assault victims? How blatantly evil can you be? What's next, offender pays 50 shekels to marry the victim?
I pray that nothing like sexual assault, harassed or rape ever happens to you. And rescinding the Title IX is a complete nonsense!
Evil, evil woman who does not care about education.  Bought a cabinet position like the rest of Trump's freak show.
Unless you are black, trans, or sexually assaulted of course
Do you also wish FEMALE college students a SAFE year? Your job is to oversee Secretary DeVos' policies. What about rape reporting changes?
U have contributed NOTHING and created SO MANY PROBLEMS. I'm from Grand Rapids; always thought the DeVos name stood for integrity.U R AWFUL
Go back to your home.
Start helping the victims not the one who committed the assault! #StopBetsy
Yeah nothing says a great start to school when you are worried about oneself/family being deported OR special bonus, our country being nuked
#TitleIX #rape #StopBetsy #BetsyRapesEducation
Unless you are transgender, poor, or a rape survivor. Then you all can fail just like the system is failing you. #transgender #TitleIX
Liar. You'd rather let them get raped and abused you fraud! 
I hope you enjoy prison, you filth.
How can that happen when they are still being taught Common Core, 5 pillars of Islam and gender crap that should not be taught in school!
Common Core was built with @BetsyDeVosED and charter schools in mind.  There are no 5 pillars of Islam being taught only Christian pillars
And is that only for the for-profit schools you love?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @FLOTUS @POTUS #MAGA #IvankaTrump #JaredKushner @BetsyDeVosED #PrincessRoyal #BetsyDeVos
Unless they are falsely accused of sexual assault.
Successful?  You mean only for those persecuted "boys" right?  #youmakemesick
@BetsyDeVosED You, Ma'am are deplorable
If you want to talk with more survivors, PM me and I'll get a whole slew together for you; can't swing a dead cat without hitting one. #rape
@BetsyDeVosED Wishing the girls and women well as you send them off to campuses where predators now feel more empowered? #RapeCulture #Shame
Only if you can afford private school. Or are a rapist.
I'm sure there will be a much greater success rate for the rapist on campus now. @BetsyDeVosED made sure of that. #BetsyRapesEducation

no, you're wishing they get raped.

And defend against a bear.
And good luck with that rape stuff college women, you're n your own on that one--Love, @BetsyDeVosED #Whatareyouthinking #StopBetsy
Free from Title IX protections! Enjoy your freedom, campus predators!
Not as long as #BetsyDeVos hangs around. She takes stupid and making others stupid to a whole new level.
Are you serious? How broken do you have to be to remove PROTECTION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT! I cannot believe people like you can hold office!
Unless you're a girl
And, if you are a woman on a college campus, good luck! Your rapist is now a victim too. #resist
Unless they are sexually harassed! Following her boss' modeled behavior, #CRUELLADEVOS undoes an Obama regulation that protected children.
Thank you!! It takes courage to stand against political correctness and the liberal bias of the day. There are many who support you!!
How is it politically correct to say we don't want to be raped?
They'd probz have a more successful year if you weren't making it easier for them to be raped and for their rapists to get away with it.
@McConnellsNeck please Stop Common Core!  It is so unfair to all students. No more 5 pillars of Islam. No more white privilege or gender bs
Some of these kids will be/have been sexually assaulted in school, & @BetsyDeVosED is making sure the perpetrators are being protected.
#StopBetsy
It's gonna be a good year for rapists.
Thanks @BetsyDeVosED
Any coincidence they are all WHITE????
I WISH!! Do something to stop the political brainwashing and political bullying. NOT OK! Why are teachers given so much power!! SCARY!
She wishes children to fail. She is a fake. She is incompetent. She is Satan's minion.
All those adorable children. Too bad they all became sycophantic filth.

DeVos, the antithesis to education, is taking away #TitleIX protections.
Next up, no Ed for women bc it'll make campuses safer.
 #StopBetsy 
It would be a success if you'd quit and gave someone with a degree or some experience in education a chance to do their magic
Leave public education alone. 
Do not rob public schools by allocating a single taxpayer dollar to private or charter schools.
Just don't get raped bc Betsy don't give a fuck!
Good luck to students? and u stand with the rapists? #StopBetsy
Wishing students a successful school year? Except the female College student population, right Betsy? #Rapeculture #StopBetsy
Betsy you're a lying cold hearted person.
Safe school year for sexual predators thanks to @BetsyDeVosED ! 
How could you expect anything less from a pussy grabbing parasite?
Except the queer ones!
@BetsyDeVosED But not a safe one, right? 
#StopBetsy
Aren't you cutting 9.2 Bllion from education?
Liberal educators are destroying our young!
End the madness!!!! These are our children your screwing up! https://twitter.com/stacylstiles/status/905509266731216896 …
Don't lie.
SHAME ON YOU @BetsyDeVos for abandoning the young women of our colleges!  SHAME!
young womxn, men, and people outside the binary!! this is a dangerous and thoughtless decision altogether!!!
When is CommonCore going away?
That's what I would love to know. And 5 pillars of Islam, teaching gender crap ( not schools responsibility and White Privilege. REALLY?
You sound demented lady.....no one is teaching 5 pillars of Islam to kids.....time to turn off Fox News ....and join the adults
America's students. The Americans that fit ONLY YOUR definition of American. So NOT #LGBTQ, #DACA, #ESL Learners, non-white students, etc.
Listen all children regardless of sex or race are being robbed on an education due to common core. Please help us get rid of it! Bad for all
What, no dark skinned kids on your list of 'successes'?
ALL students right? Because @BetsyDeVosED seems to forget about the disabled, LGBT, poor, minority's and public education kids...
Except the brown ones.
Speaking of that school year: http://reason.com/blog/2017/09/06/lawyer-in-campus-rape-disputes-the-accus … @Reason
@BetsyDeVosED: You're not only unqualified, you're insufferable and a hypocrite.
Betsy needs more maids, she gets them by mentoring them in school. After causing the state's schools to fail miserably of course.
Don't you mean a successful year to dishonest loan companies?  You getting kickbacks?
Betsy, what is stopping you from taking a look at the best pre-apprenticeship program America has ever seen?
What is keeping her from doing away with common core?
Close down the 
Dept. Of Education
so telling your tweet #REPEALESSA
@BetsyDeVosED What!? UR trying 2 profit off our children! Save it Hun. We R NOT GOP Senators. U can't pay us off. You are SICK!
DeVos's Education Dept cancels deal with consumer bureau to fight student loan fraud http://hill.cm/C8hBDxu  cc: @usedgov
Does that include DACA recipients? How about ESL learners or public school kids?
Wow! They are all white? Hmmmmm
"America's Students" ??? Does that include all students entering schools or just the white ones? The White "Christian" ones?
Does that include brown students too?  Or just the white ones?  You know you are, just say it... "imma pussy"
You're still a joke DeVos!! Out of touch and not realistic. How do you sleep? Shameful leader! I will not stop.!!!
You really have a way of demonstrating diversity.  Is this your version of d perfect picture / America.  You truly r a horrible person!!!!!!
Does that include the DACA students. When are you going to man up and do the right thing? When?
She will ruin their schools then hire them to clean for her
#U Hired A.Wayne Johnson who ran for profit student loan company that charged struggling students high interest rates. This isn't public Ed
Except you students who were brought here as children, by parents who came here illegally. Not going to be a good year. #DACA
Well, EXCEPT the Brown ones!
Betsy - @POTUS is not going to give Erik the big contract for Afghanistan, so you might as well use the #25thamendment.
.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @seanspicer @Scaramucci @Reince @maddow @colbertlateshow @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP @BetsyDeVosED
Wishing America's rich white Christian students a successful school year! #BackToSchool 
Notice it doesn't say wishing ALL students a successful school year.
Only YOU would RT this on a day POTUS destroyed the lives of so many who also want the same chance to learn! Hateful!
You helped give a rich bitch control of schools and she had no idea except private schools.  Drive more between the rich and poor!
Back to school was last month!
REALLY would love to know when you plan to replace the nasty school lunch brought on by Michelle Obama with something the kids will eat.
As your boss makes it difficult for them to feel safe in schools. Good work there.
The irony is astounding.
Let's remember the students educated here who are grown and are working hard for the American dream. Reverse Trumps DACA decision.
no gun in school
except for DACA students I suppose!!  #SupportDACA #NotMyPresident
Only If they can clean her house. No lie, she mentored a kid then hired her and her mom as maids....
Tell that to the Dreamers. GOP is absolutely despicable.
Like you give a shit!
wishing @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP would rid us of common core, it's an affront 2 education, ABC's & 123's put us on the moon, downhill since
OMG the DIVERSITY!!!!  #DACA

@SpeakerRyan it's going to take a lot more than wishing with DeVoss as secretary
You only showed White Children who are now about 50 yrs old. Propoganda???
Now we are wishing that Congress will do their jobs now and pass all pending legislation by the end of September
Mke Ur learning "fun" Enjoy the sch Yr.
