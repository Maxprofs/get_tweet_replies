First a visit to a Catholic school, now a visit to a charter? Just more evidence that you do not care nor support public education.
Public school teachers are paid more than parochial schools. So what do you care.
#RethinkDeVos.  All teachers are underpaid. As are soldiers. I've done both. DeVos bought seat and has no honor. She is a broken promise.
What has she done that actually hurts any teacher
As a @realDonaldTrump you would think you would hold the admin to task when they break promises. DeVos, Chinesse trade deficit, DACA... when
Working on all of it.
Obama took almost 2 yrs to pass ACA. SO please. I am a supporter but a realist. My #1 was SCJ GORSUCH, 2nd Mattis
That is not a thing that took time. It was the wrong decision, and I won't let @realDonaldTrump break promises quietly. @BetsyDeVosED is bad
#RethinkDeVos @BetsyDeVosED is the #swampwater he promised to drain. She bought that seat and is unqualified. I will fight that till I die.
I find it quite odd that the heavy critics on here are basically newly opened Twitter accounts with no followers. BOTS
Thank you Boo. The love that eminates from your soul is truly inspiring to voters. Keep up the good work.
"Grab her by the pussy" was inspiring to you so don't come at me with that, sweetie.
Oh darling. Your beautiful words to me just make me melt.
Who the fuck welcomed you
Of all the issues needing attention, you focus on TitlelX. Only conclusion is a family member raped someone on campus & you're getting even
When are you visiting public schools? Or have you totally given up on those...?
Most don't let her in
She did in Nebraska. But charter and private schools.
And our taxpayers should go to 275 student charter schools that pay CEO salaries? Puhleeze. No.

Dear @BetsyDeVosED,Please view and reply to: http://www.stringquest.com/betsy-devos-vision-proposal … Emailed @usedgov 
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse please assist - thanks! 

DeVos Defends Trump by Saying: 'Would a Moron Hire Me?'

I think she just answered the question and insulted herself all at once.

@BetsyDeVosED, do you take commercial flights as you travel the country or am I paying for private jets for you and your entourage?

DeVos champions online charter schools, but in PA, an early adopter, not one meets the state’s "passing" benchmark
Drain the swamp!!

You are a sick  Betsy! You help not a soul but your own self
Sec Devos please do not allow democrats screw with your policies. Obama is gone. Create fair policy for all. Thank you 
Secretary DeVos, please teach this woman how to spell and construct a sentence that is grammatically correct. REAL Americans can do that. 
Lol boy, wtf? Perhaps you need to learn how to read. Perhaps you are still under your moms roof 
Did you just say "boy"!  How dare you!  How low can you go?  SHAME ON YOU!
And someday, I hope we will recover from you!
Please, only thing you care about is making money. Rethinking how to make YOURSELF richer. Selfish cow.

Thank you K-School students - brilliant question at end of video - brilliant protest! https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2017/9/29/1702700/-Betsy-DeVos-faces-absolutely-stunning-silent-protest-at-Harvard?detail=facebook …
Does it not bother you that the majority of America know your not qualified for the position you are in. Just do everybody a favor & resign

I hope none of these children suffer due to your incompetence. Especially anyone that is assaulted. Any investigating should involve police
Shame on you
Comically Ignorant cult member who BOUGHT her way to a position she has no right holding tells the normal people of society to"rethink."
NOT QUALIFIED TO WORK IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.
Did you grab any pussies while there Betsy? #TitleIX
How about the regular route of long-term treatment. Stop wasting our education money
How's that profitization working for your pocketbook thus far?
Hmmmm..would that be a public school?  #resign
What about vouchers???????
Is this one of those charter schools that takes tax $ and runs when it realizes it's failing?
PLEASE help our kids in CA schools! Cant afgord home schooling! Going to lose my daughter!!!
Sec DeVos!! Im at wits end! Stuck in Lib Ca.. full time RN, primary breadearner with 13yo in public school. Im paycheck 2 paycheck- she is
Being indoctronated.. told that 9/11 was NOt about Islamic terrorism and WE R islamaphobes 2 believe it. Her teachers hate @POTUS pot- snark
Snarky comments. Textbooks have more about Islam than any other culture (incl the "beauty" of Sharia) I AM BEHIND U! NEED SCHOOL VOUCHER NOW
Keeping doors open and students realizing they have obtainable options is huge
I HOPE you resign!
#RethinkDeVos.  She does not know service @realDonaldTrump. She is your broken word and a slap in the face of those you do know service.
#RethinkDeVos. @realDonaldTrump allowed #unqualified #ivorytowerelitistcoward #swampwater to buy seat when better people wanted to serve...
ReThink
DeVos

#DumpDeVoss
Time to #RethinkBetsyDevos  #supportPublicSchools #ResignNow
Building youth #recovery supports for the leading cause of death in America - #addiction - is vital @genfoundfilm
That's a  lot of scowling faces. Maybe they should #rethinkdevos
@devos is scouting for prisoners for her prisons
thank you for visiting Hope Academy and listening to the amazing stories of our students and families.
A picture of a salad would get more likes than this tweet
All those people and you are still the least qualified at the table.
Data has proven time & again charters, vouchers, and Achievement School Districts perform the same and in most cases worse than pub. schools
Evangelical fascists out!
You're just an unqualified rich zealot.
All these schools you visited are very inspiring. It would be great to have fed grants available to fund these initiatives across the US.
Public education is the foundation of our nation! The USA deserves a new Education Secretary...
She's a rich inexperience person who bought her job, donating a 1/4 of a million to the GOP. Wants 2 faze out the public school syst. Evil
Poor Betsy DeVos. She has never held a real job before so she had no idea that people were going to be so hard on her.
When will you ever go to an#publicschool? They are valuable to community and even serve as shelters.
How about visiting some of the awesome traditional public schools
Please pm me @Domo70J. I have something important to show you.
Thank u for rescinding that bs order, we have police depts to investigate sex assault NOT the university,@BarackObama are you that ignorant
#BetsyDeSaster, the last thing you give millions of teachers is hope.

No one cares about what your doing because your not doing much
Wonder if you know anything about prenatal alcohol exposure? They are a population that needs attention for education and vocational ed!

#loser
You are an embarrassment & waste of taxpayer dollars. Why do you think taxpayers should foot a $8 million dollar bill for special treatment?
Do it Betsy! Do it. Destroy Obamas shit policy 

Step down.
#RethinkResignation
DOWN WITH ALL LIBERAL SOCIALIST EDUCATION UNIONS & SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS & 6 FIGURE SALARY ADMINISTRATOR'S THAT HAVE POISONED OUR KIDS
Have you ever been to a public school?
She took a dump there once.
#ReThinkSchool #RethinkBetsyDevos
#fireDevos  #nitwit
K Betsy. 
Bot
I hear they do great work. It's important to have a high school that focuses on the special needs of recovering teen addicts.
Can @BetsyDeVosED try and help the public school kids with some of these great programs too?  And why is it ok to profit off of our kids?
This is a tuition free school. Where's the profit?
Her tour in general. And her philosophy overall. She hasn't highlighted public schools or introduced any policy to bring innovation to ps.
I don't see how this tour ties to profit?  Yes, she must visit with public schools. I'm wondering if she has been invited?
I wonder how her staff members  decide which schools she will visit?
Not sure. But if schools invite her and she doesn't accept, I'm sure we will hear about it.
Go to the schools that NEED INSPIRATION!!!!!
To crush their hope?
Really? She is clueless.
We need data and research and methods from our boss.
How?
You are extremely unqualified. If you weren't a major donor you wouldn't have this job. Please step aside and let an educator have your job
If you wanna help these kids get rid of this man made testes called TAAS,TEKS
Testes, huh?
Testis
yea my bad on the spelling I was rushing..lmbo  I will proof read my work next time..lol
Testes is better.
On behalf of all Hoosier educators, please leave. #teachersvsgrizzlies #devos #rethinkdevos
You are a high school teacher?
You're job involves more than photo ops. Results??
I think she is doing great. Michaels shit lunch menu is gone.
I truly wish DeVos was doing great, but our corrupt education system needs more than a lunch menu change
She is working on it!
Still waiting, tic toc..
What exactly are you doing to help? Calm down!
You're yelling. No results are deserving of no support. Betsy needs to step things up.
You're doing nothing but bitching. Pretty sure it will take some time to fix all of Obama administration BS.
I hope we recover quickly after you are gone!

You suck
