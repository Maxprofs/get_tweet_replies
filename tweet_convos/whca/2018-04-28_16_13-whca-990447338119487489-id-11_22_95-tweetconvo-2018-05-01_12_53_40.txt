No one should be proud to be there.
Disgusting event for a dishonorable profession. There's no doubt any more. Defend Tom Brokaw, defend Joy Reid and celebrate vile hatred all in the same day.
GREAT PHOTO. And great bosses.
You need to apologize to Sarah Sanders!!!
Being proud of that is a tell.......
That event was nothing to be proud of
