Congratulations to the scholarship recipients! May you be blessed in your journey ahead in Journalism.
Thank You so much!
He can take a cute picture, but didn't @SpeakerRyan just have kids arrested at his office 4 peacefully & lawfully protesting? The hypocrisy never ends. @WHCA should use their time reporting on Puerto Rico, Flint, MI, ICE abuses, Pruitt, Mulvaney, etc., instead of kissing @GOP ass
They do spend the vast majority of their time reporting on issues of national importance. This was an opportunity to give student journalists, including me, scholarships and connections with mentors in the field. Paul Ryan came to offer congratulations for about 30 minutes.
That does not discount the fact that he had lawful student protestors arrested. What message did he send to those students?
So smarmy.
So Ryan fired a chaplain for encouraging empathy, effectively oppressing freedom of speech and yet you invite him to an event like this.  What a crock!
figures this clown would support the vile organization
Journalists are lying bigots.
Did he tell em about his marathon time.  Lying pos.
You aren’t journalists. https://twitter.com/cellinoatt/status/990558042411487232?s=21 …
Don't dance for politicians, 'check & balance' them. 
'the PEOPLE' (& millions of cameras) are watching
