Another certainty for each attendant is enrollement in the hack club. You're all disgusting. Really. This is what you wanted to do?
Looking forward to your jokes about Tom brokaw, Joy Reid, Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer. Oh wait.....
That was the worst choice for comedian choice, choosing @michelleisawolf you could have made bc it was not funny in the least, rather vulgar & cringe worthy.
Another certainty is a circlejerk of pathetic lickspittles. Happens every year.
It takes the announcer 6 times to tell your guests to sit the F  down its about to start??? WOW what idiots!
Joking about murder. How far gone are you?
And abortion jokes. Because abortion jokes are just SO FUNNY. And you people blame TRUMP for why you're despised? YOU'RE the reason he WON. And THIS behavior will guarantee he wins AGAIN! Why do you not see that?

.@edhenry: “Sarah Sanders should get an apology from the White House Correspondents’ Association.” 
We say Trump is “not Presidential.”  Then how should we describe our own behavior of name calling and ridiculing someone’s features?
repugnant. Funny to attack physical features?  kids’ grade school it’s called bullying. not tolerated - by or from anyone!  Shame on us for stooping to this because we lost the election!   Hate-based “humor”

WHY is @PressSec invited when all she does is yell at you guys and lie to you all?????  She shouldn’t be invited to anything. She’s as embarrassing as Trump
