Perhaps ICE is worried the reporter might regard the defendant as an actual human with actual legal rights?
It's all very well tweeting this around. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT! HAVE YOU BECOME THAT GLIB?
This is so disturbing 
Freedom of the Press is freedom to report what is happening. It is an announcement similar to a proclamation.

Freedom of the Press does not give a Press Pass holder the right to circumvent the US Constitution, Bill of Rights, US Code, or the Federal Code of Regulations.
Freedom of the Press also does not allow reporters and journalists to circumvent court proceedings or breach established security protocols.

For all the court knows, those notes could be schematics pf the location of a prisoner or a sketch of a high risk takedown officer.
