Had a great time at White House Correspondents Dinner. Met a lot of fun and interesting people. #WHCD @FrankLuntz @edhenry @jonkarl 
Why was a former baseball player invited to this? Who invited him?
How great?
I can’t imagine that the display that was The White House Correspondents Dinner last night represented what you claim to be about.  Bullying and trashing Sarah Huckabee Sanders was atrocious! #stopthewhca
You said on GMA Michelle Wolff went too far with huckleberry sanders? So you hold Wolff to a higher standard than huckleberries daily lies and the orange baboons daily insults?  Huckleberry insults the media on a daily basis! She deserved what she got! Too bad, so sad!

Disgraceful, all of you! Condemnation is in order.
Just heard you say on @GMA that there was "no question" Wolf went too far at the WHCD. No question? If you have no questions, then you are not a journalist, but merely one more pundit whose OPINION has no place on news programs passing as unbiased.
Jon I saw @paulafaris and @danbharris mention @realDonaldTrump and The Nobel Prize on @GMA but if Kim Jong Un does the right thing I believe @dennisrodman deserves credit for bringing peace to Korea.
Another comedian? Lol
What moron chose Wolf?  OMG....she fell short big time!  I will remember this one for as long as I live!  It was so pathetic!  But...carry on! 
The fact that you liked it says it all.
