Seen many cases when WP was mostly fake especially re coverage of European events and issues. Clearly twisted, tinted and misleading. Used to be good paper - NO MORE !
Gratz to you
Could not help but notice...no sign of FOX on the list ;)

Thank God for #REALNEWS journalists! Please keep up the great work! This horrible time for our country, never seems to end. Everyday a new salacious story hits; but nothing’s changing! I miss Obama, George W & HW, Clinton, Reagan, even Nixon was better than this! When’s it over?
Hi Mr. Baron, have mailed you but in vain, what's the way to reach you. Would like to invite you as speaker for @journalism_talk
Congrats!! Keep up the great journalism.
THANK YOU. I once wanted to be a Washington Post journalist like Woodward & Bernstein that ship sailed many years ago so I hope the young adults that are the new sounding board are the future Philip Rucker & Ashley Parker. BRAVO!
So am I!  Last week I ponied up for a subscription to WAPO & NYTIMES to support the great work the do in support of democracy.
You were colleagues with this crowd as well US paper says sorry for 'fake' photos https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/14/pressandpublishing.iraq …?
I meant the free and democratic world.
Your paper does a wonderful job. A piece about how President Grifter is actually scaring the rest of the world would be good.

doesn't take much these days to get a Pulitzer Prize, Just like obama giving out medals like candy on Halloween.
Wow - POTUS is already beyond angry with the Comey book and interview. He's really gonna flip his lid now.

Winning a Pulitzer for, in part, exposing a political scam artist who pretends to be a journalist may he the most journalistic thing that ever journalisted. Congrats to all.
Proud to be a print and online subscriber to the Washington Post and do my small part to support your outstanding work!
Great reporting in a great newspaper led by America's finest editor
And you were there by the greatest editor's side (working) way back at the start of his amazing career!
