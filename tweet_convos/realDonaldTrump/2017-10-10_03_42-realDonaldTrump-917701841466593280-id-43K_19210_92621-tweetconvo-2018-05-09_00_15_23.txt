Keep your filthy racist tweets off @jemelehill!
@jemelehill is a smart sagacious Sister who told the truth about a self absorbed racist megalomaniac! Her bosses at @espn lack integrity!
Please keep your filthy p***y grabbing twitter fingers from insulting @jemelehill, we’ll have none of that from a racist miscreant like you!
Real sad @realDonaldTrump @VP & Evangelical ‘Christians’ lose it over so called disrespect of the FLAG but not real disrespect of the CROSS
ESPN: A relic of the 1990s. It's also the Worldwide Leader in Hypocrisy.
We cut the cord. I don't need political lectures from sportscasters. They are destroying their brand from within...
ESPN:  Liberal hypocrites. 
Different rules for different people...

#shoveyourspolotics @espn @nfl @NFLPA @jemelehill @marclamonthill @Kaepernick7 @49ers #MAGA WE LOVE OUR FLAG! @realDonaldTrump
*mic
False!
Every trite thought coming from ur tiny fingers  diminishes your cred.  Keep at it, u'll be at 20% approval ratings before you know it.
Calif burning, people dead, people dying in PR and THOS is your focus? Pathetic
Again may be you should focus on real world issues and remembering your wife is standing next to you during speeches!!!#DumbAssDude
You have no idea what it means to represent that f****** flag to represent the f****** national anthem.
You drunk tweeting again don? It's 'mic'. Can the WH please take his phone so he can focus on PR & the numerous things a president should be
With all due respect, you should focus on the multiple natural disasters, tax reform, immigration and healthcare. 

Sincerely,
 A supporter
President Trump realizes this culture war is critical-
He should focus on all of it & he is.
Example: NFL now forced to retreat
The cultural war that he is helping to spark? At least the players are being proactive with Police in Seattle. Report that. I'll wait......
Nothing positive from you guys. Let's move forward. Let's improve these relations not make them worse. Shouldn't that be the goal?
I'll never stop defending cops, military, & our country -
The kneeling started with Colin K. demeaning cops as "pigs" -
I won't either. Kap's opinion or poor choice is personal, not a whole. Like saying all NFL players are bad. You're just as guilty as him now
She took on Trump, she lost. She took on the troops, troops won. She took on America she lost AND she fought the law and the law won! #MAGA
She should have known better than take on great Donald that create successful Trump U, casinos, airline, magazine, etc. He MAGA after golf!
Dude you're belligerent.
*mic ... just sayin. Idk who Mike is.
The industry hating you is the talk of the industry and it's mic like microphone not m i k e you dumb lil cheese-it
The industry are a bunch of liberals who live in their own little world in their own little state and have no idea about reality!
Girl, go take a nap. A nice.. long one. 
mic.

Trump’s approval ratings are in the toilet, have been since he took office, and the #SonofaBitchTrump has the gall to critique ESPN ratings.
You’re terrible at pretending to be a president. Your ratings are the lowest of all time! Why don’t you quit and become a critic!
I've yet to see him do a majority of his campaign promises. I'm not seeing much progress so far.

Somebody call me when he makes progress.
@jemelehill Hey Trump have you seen your approval ratings? Talk about tanking... you're the KING OF TANKING, u do it daily
The only ratings that have "tanked" are yours...lowest approval rating EVER of any president, 

#ESPNSuicide #JemmelHill
Act like a President for fucks sake. I voted for you. Up all night spewing incomprehensible twitter mumbles like a 14 year old with a stiffy
ESPN ratings are way better than yours
Why do you use your platform to bully people ?
This guy is so sick! When will the Republucan party say ENOUGH!!! WTF!
Mike who?
The mike?

Did they tank worse than your ratings?
"MIKE"!!! DOTARD, it's "Mic"
If they're tanking it's because of their racism...and yours #White SupremacistWH .@realDonaldTrump
https://goo.gl/tkkn1Q  "tanked" in quote marks indicates that it's either sarcasm or not true. That's what it means in English grammar.
When will you be staging a #FakeOutrage visit to an #NFL game
ESPN still has betting approval ratings then you, so does Jemele Hill.
First of all it’s Mic, not Mike. And no their ratings haven’t tanked. If you want to continue to lie to the public to protect
Your fragile ego, maybe you should resign, because I can guarantee this job’s not going to get easier for you.
Is he really talking about decling ratings?  Pot, let me introduce you to the kettle.
Have you checked your poll ratings lately?

Especially with educated people who can spot fake news?

Don't think you should talk ratings.
Mike or mic?
Uh, yeah...about that.

Yeah, this is presidential. Mueller.
 MIC  as in microphone! Did we miss episodes of Sesame Street, where you learn the basicswhat a nightmare. #IratherhaveBush

Vote and Retweet: What is your opinion on guns?
R u serious?  This is what ur worried about? Despite Geraldo's BS, people r dying. Wake the f-k up.
It’s sickening isn’t it? Good Grief he’s crazy! 
I’ve had enough too!
i'm fromJapan
Your cool！
We sincerely respect
You tweet about the news demeaning people then do it yourself. I voted for you, please stop embarrassing yourself and lead not tweet.
*mic, not mike. Make Spelling Great Again!
You want to know what people are really talking about? How bad you suck. It is unpresidented.

You mean like the way the USA's ratings have tanked since Russia bought the presidential election for you?
W/ @realDonaldTrump in the oval office, it is no wonder America's reputation have tanked. In fact, half of his original White House is gone!
Nah. We in the industry are talking about why #Weinstein is a thing when we have a sex offender as #POTUS

#1yrTrump #MuellerIsComing
Who’s mike? 
I'm mike but I don't know Jemele and she's not with me. Hopefully ESPN puts her back on the mic.
@realDonaldTrump & scary clowns linked as #AHS becomes political fiction TV series for subliminal brainwashing.  no media conspiracy? Ha!
Can anyone reference another TV series that moved from pure fiction after building an audience to blatant political bias like #AHS Cult?
Damn do you just attack people of color  u never come for the caucasians that are against you hence 2 days and u said nothing about @Eminem
So wait. You know what the "talk of the industry" is, but you don't know WTF is happening in world politics? U should know THAT!
Don't you have more important things to worry about?
You mean, like a mikerophone?
Who is mike?
Shut up and do your job! wtf has Espn got to do with running the country?
yeah right, #liar #fakenews  stop watching tv and focus on your job
You've tanked so badly you are the talk of the world.
Mr. President, one would assume you have a staff full of people with college degrees... get them to spell check your tweets before you post.
*mic
Gee, one would think you'd be be too busy doing YOUR job to continue yammering about ESPN and the NFL. #GrowUp
Maybe you should be a constant guest on ESPN, DJ, because you're an expert at everything. ESPN would be great again.
It's a mic not a Mike. Mike is your vice-president.
You're the president. You don't have time to watch TV. I'm a student. I haven't watched TV in MONTHS.
God how we wish we could go back to 1990, when you were bankrupt, and the elites that hated you let you off the hook. you were done. if only
it's "mic"
哈哈哈
Personal attacks on reporters should be unacceptable for any elected official; much less the president of the United States
Everyday you astound me with your stupidity. Every  damn  day 
Dike
you gotta get schwifty
WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT ESPN'S RATINGS????
You lied about being under audit! Larry Flynt will get your tax returns released!
Maybe you can use that 'big brain' of your to spell 'mic' correctly.  You think?
Nfl and it's players are losing endorsements which hits them right where it hurts. Hahahahaa, I'd rather watch golf.
Resign
so, um, you sit around and watch ESPN all day ... don't you have something else to do?
Jemele & NFL R Racists, scream black power & disrespect country! Need 2 do background checks on them & fire all felons & violent preditors!
Plz donu stop mistaking 
At least at spelling words
I love that instead of having legitimate arguments, the left wingers are making fun of small grammatical errors
.@realDonaldTrump looking bad. No mention of #PuertoRicoRelief  and #CaliforniaWildfires Ranting stupid stuff.
How about you worry less about the entertainment industry and more about being a decent human being. Less travel, more aid! #embarrassment
Worry about your own horrible ratings, it’s the talk of the world
ESPN is just fine. Stadiums are still packed, televisions are still tuned in to watch games. You and your crap did nothing.
Can you just run the country
 #onTwitterBitchingAgain
J. Hill is a fool. ESPN can have her. I am done.
I wish liar’s pants would catch fire.
Have you EVER told the truth about anything??? #Trumpshitshow
your Tweet was quoted by @USATODAY
Malia Obama!
Tanked.. omg, you're delusional!
"mike"  @humpmasterj1234
"Mike"
Well then you're in good company because your approval rating...
Are they tanking like your job numbers? You racist failure!
Sir u must somehow get someone to go after all the crooks Clinton,started with Watergate and still continues
mic*
The NFL is over. Their players just ruined the entire franchise permanently
Is it though?
Not as bad as your approval rating at 37%
And how's that tweet coming along honor the four dead Special Forces Green Berets? Or are you too busy with your NFL rant?
At the mike  lmao 
You gonna comment on those soldiers who died in Niger or nah?
The orange peel continues to speak about things that he does on a daily basis, spew more bs.
@espn jemele Hill is a terrible sports announcer
You are disgusting how you deliberately go after people's careers #bullying
U mean they tanked more than UR ratings? Incredible!
Are you going to be our president or media analyst? Smh  Bigger fish to fry out here .
why are we still talking about this? So many bigger and more important problems that demand attention.
Please leave the sports realm there.. u stick to running the country. Focus on PR instead of worthless ESPN and more worthless Hill please!
Mr. President, I know you're fascinated by ratings, so I thought you'd like to see your latest:
Get your the President not white trash TV commentary. Stay off Twitter if you can’t control your mouth. Your embarrassing us
Hey @fema why aren't ppl in #PuertoRico getting water and help? Who is in charge? Not this fool.
Move on to sponsors, boycott different one each week, this week Budweiser, this buds not for you, pass it on.
Good to know that you're up to date on sports gossip while blundering your way into instigating nuclear war. 
It’s mic not mike
Challenges someone to an IQ test comparison, cause he would lose a dick comparison too, and then spells mic as "mike". SAD!
You are the most powerless, ineffective "Leader of the Free World" ever to sit in the Oval Office. Delete your account, senile old man.
Guess who has tanked as POTUS?

Lowest rating yet to come!
uh oh i think it's Jemele's turn. Go Hard DT!
THE MILITARY CALLED AND WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR DODGING THE DRAFT 5X
LMFAO! @realDonaldTrump Are we really still talking about this?? And in your position... You are one sad tiny little man. #StopTheMadness

Impeachment
It's spelled "mic".  Still wanna take that IQ test?
Oooh gossip!
Why is he at Mike? What did Mike do? You're fucking illiterate
Yes, it is. The men our neighborhood, co-workers, Gym are saying#espn isnow with#jemelehill
Don't you have other shit you should be worrying about, like running our fucking country into the ground and playing golf?
That's just not true, and not how any of this works. You think espn executives don't care about their ratings? Lol 
What? You aren't even talking about the same thing anymore...
Look like Trumplican is attacking powerful black men and women. I can see why you would be intimidated, you lack intelligence
Have they "tanked" worse than your approval ratings? Asking for a friend.
Did you mean "mic" as in an abbreviation for microphone? Or were you purposely writing a name?
You spelled mike wrong. It's mic not mike.
SAD!
Well Mike Smith lol
Your ratings are nothing to crow about either! Bring Back Obama!
Who's Mike? And why is Jemele at him? 

#MoronInChief
Mike & Mike... You know the morning talk show she is frequently a guest on and has hosted.
Ah! Those Mikes  ... It wouldn't surprise me if he sees your Tweet and appropriates it as truth ...
little late to the game there
Which mike? Or did you mean mic as in microphone?
Smh. The left is so terrible at this. Lmao
Just saying. For such an articulate and deliberate speaker... His grammar is atrocious.
I think he's just trolling smug liberals. When you let it get to you, he wins. Just ignore him!
Spoken like a true adult.
I'm 'just saying!' 
I think you're absolutely right. I really hope there's a big Ashton Kutcher pranked type reveal now at the end of his tenure
You're struggling. Just stop  #MAGA
With Donald Trump at the mike, it is no wonder Americas ratings have "tanked," in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the World!
Persian golfffffffff
I cannot understand tanking.
Don’t you have a Country to run! DO YOUR JOB!
Stop tweeting.
Only thing "tanking" is @realDonaldTrump  #Trump tweets are very revealing as #MuellerInvestigation continues to learn the Truth.
トランプ大統領を応援しております。
こんなにも、拉致事件などこれほど日本に寄り添って考えて下さるアメリカの大統領はこれまでもこれからも、きっといません。
トランプ大統領だけです。
本当にありがとうございます。
WOW have you seen your numbers?  I know fake! Bahaha you are such a child. Go work for the country that you are destroying. Worst numbers
It's called a mic weren't you once supposedly in show business? Lolololol
Sir, you have more inportamt stuffs to do than commenting on Jemele
I think you need to put up or shut up, take the I.Q. test.
@south of evan Do you think you're going to "fix" President Trump? He's done just fine without your help!
Monday morning.  How can I stir the pot of hate and divide the country today? Have a go at Jemele? Yes. Time to simmer that stew!
Shouldn't you be working or something?
My president,  defender of the weak help southern Cameroon genocide going on. Please my president don't allow us to be extinct
Give me a reason why not
