@sherrylou916 @TeamTrump Many of those without coverage were fined for not having it n it came straight out of tax refund.
yrs my son was one of them. Who works 2 jobs. Cause they cut hours so they don't have to provide.
They made it hard on so many ppl and sad thing is they knew it would n didn't care.

@TeamTrump stop tweeting. Go prepare your concession speech.
even obama's 1/2 brother is voting for Donald Trump

listen, I love my country, I'm not a liberal, I work, I don't need my taxes and insurance to skyrocket
already voting for him and encouraging him to believe the bs of a rigged election (an election he claims to be winning)
we just have to wait and see how many people vote for a traitor, liar, murderer, corrupt Hillary Clinton
you can disagree with her positions, but that is a fact.
if you don't like our founding fathers, our constitution, our rights and freedoms, letting radicals across our borders, get out
There are over 300 Million people in this country and Oscrewy aimed for a mere 20M that already were covered.
@TeamTrump @CHRISSIMSMAN1 I would love to see his health care he has and Hillary's health care

@TeamTrump The only problem is you have nothing to replace it with. #Obamacare
@TeamTrump S T O P
Boasts he can shoot someone&get away with it incites violence threatens voters& doesn't want to accept results on 11/8. SAD
@TeamTrump Don't blame the Affordable Care Act for insurance companies gouging the public while making billions in profits.
.@realDonaldTrump Trump's biggest lie is that he cares about the ordinary American. He can't be our President!
@TeamTrump: Right! Strip poor ppl of their coverage. That's about yr speed. Who cares about poor ppl -- right?
FOLLOW THE MONEY.
@TeamTrump with what?  You don't even HAVE a plan Doofus Donald!  Affordable Care was a Godsend!
U have never been for U.S.  all about u....making a mockery of  our government. I are the ultimate  joke.

#Obamacare what is the proposed replacement. We should fix problems be we need to agree who is covered for what first
@TeamTrump @MichaelCohen212 @KellyannePolls @KatrinaPierson CARL FROM PEARL,MS. SAYS READ YOUR EMAIL I SENT 2DAY IMPORTANT.

Haven't you got underage girls to be flirting with?
Replace with what?
@NavyVets4Trump @TeamTrump it was given to Congress to fix.They have their heads 2 far up their asses to try. You suck btw.
Increases are a direct result of Health Insurance Companies, period. They wrote Obamacare, remember?
The Kelly File (10/20/16) Trump Jokes This Is Clintons Largest Crowd -  ...
think 20 million Americans who now have health care becuz of Obamacare are going to vote 4 the one who wants to repeal it?
Let's see a plan, big talker.
@TeamTrump Obamacare been  in trouble 8 years - quick as the ink dried

@TeamTrump with all due respect mr. Trump Obamacare sucks I hope if you get an office you fix it government scam
You do not even have a replacement so go back under your rock.
@TeamTrump my ins just dumped me (and our entire community)due to its struggling to survive because of obamacare
if the election is rigged why are you still  on your terrible campaign?
@TeamTrump no thanks to GOP GOVERNORS. who refuse to expand Medicare
@TeamTrump
@TeamTrump I have great insurance and my price actually went down this year!!
@TeamTrump eat a dick you orangutan!
@TeamTrump False.   Nobody believes your lies anymore.
@TeamTrump So you will repeal instead of overhauling. Welfare wasn't perfect. Bill fixed that.
WRONG! My Obamacare premium is going up 7.5%, small compared to pre-ACA yearly increases.
@TeamTrump But what specifically is YOUR plan, Mr. Trump?  It is 19 days before election and you have NEVER told YOUR plan!
.@realDonaldTrump What are you going to replace it with?
@TeamTrump replace with?  Single health pay???
I have noticed you have a very limited vocabulary you seem to always use same words.
That's 1 in 10 w/out coverage. Remember that social programs ie, medicare, SS, and so on have been works in progress. 1/2
I want to see if U can answer a Q w/out hyperbole:How would U get ppl coverage that do not have it? A straight answer only.
I asked U that when U started UR campaign. U never answered. U only sent me repeated requests 4 donations.
