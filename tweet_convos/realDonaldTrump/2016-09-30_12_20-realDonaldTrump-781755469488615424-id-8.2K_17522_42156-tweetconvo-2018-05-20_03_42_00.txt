Can't handle the truth! People in your camp are talking, representing you, saying not-so-nice things about you.
What grade are you in?
@realDonaldTrump Lying so many years how can we know hes lying ? Just ask Roy Moore? He said 20 woman R lying and @realDonaldTrump said 18 woman r lying. So u believe them.
Did you tell that to your LITTLE buddy at @FoxNews ?...
In other words anything you tweet.

you were quoted in a story by @washingtonpost

Except by the government back in 70’s. Then he learned to keep his racism on down low until…..
Who is writing these tweets? We demand #proofofTrump before we believe these MSM lies!!
Donnie I love you but it's fucking 3am. Get some sleep you're gonna have a country to run!
Delete your account.
Now that's just funny:)
@HillaryClinton
Why don't you sue them for slander then? Stop lying
What if they say #ManyPeopleAreSaying ?
Donald too you every one is a liar. Funny thing is you bluff all the time true card player
Donald the guy who never lie... facepalm
Mark Levin said he would help you defeat Hillary.Just call him.He hates Hillary
All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Go back to HELL!
why? No one wants to go back to California
just like half of the things you say.
Go to bed, old man.
I never believe the hype. We All know better. Can't wait to see you sworn in as President of the United States! #TrumpTrain
but we must be on our guard to watch out for Democrats committing voter fraud
debate stage is only you and USA people,DO NOT care moderator,Hillary short or not answer,only tell your want to say,smile.
Trump you do live in a bubble and the people around you have to kiss your feet because your pre-Madonna
U r the "Best" in making up lies.Yours uncountable and pathological.These people r investigative reporters.They r credible
Right!
Leave America alone. #LyinTrump #ClownTrain #BigCheeto
I have a very good brain. Probably the best brain. I use all the best words!
Confused @Kiranshani1 wants me to learn the facts, which is fine, but doesn't like Donald's words when they're spoken by someone else! Sad!
your the leader we need! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA
.@realDonaldTrump Right! The only credible news comes from Breitbart, Drudge, InfoWars,&Putin's diary. Everything else is jst a liberal rag!
genuinely don't know if you're being sarcastic. that's where we're at in this election right now.
.@CodyBrown haha, I know sarcasm doesn't really play on Twitter but I can't help it. It's how I cope...
@CNN anonymous sources are the tooth fairly and the easter bunny. What a sad network.
no worries! People's eyes are now open. WE ALL KNOW 80% of the MEDIA Constantly LIE. Incredible.
#ManyPeopleAreSaying the sources come from the cyber


like when your sources were discovering fresh information about Obama in Kenya & Hawaii?
Should I believe you when you say #ManyPeopleAreSaying? #TrumpIsAnAbuser #TrumpIsUnhinged
Caption: "Duffer wanted to call a Mulligan, but it was too late."
That's what YOU always say before you tell a lie! "someone told me.." or "many people think.." @realDonaldTrump #ImWithHer
"someone told me Obama's birth certificate is a fake". @thenextgeddylee @realDonaldTrump
that was probably Hillary Clinton considering she started that rumor
That is also not true. @chris157522 @thenextgeddylee @realDonaldTrump

this is a false image and a lie, again your a liar for publishing lies
America needs a truthful POTUS again!
I appreciate the truth first time in my life I've heard it in 57 yrs. No way Demos can be Christians, but they will answer to God almighty.
sources say Donald Trump is a rich man and a business genius. But I haven't seen any evidence. So it's lies
@nleeCollins

Except of course when u say "someone said" (95% of the time), right, dear leader?
When tho
And you would know all about lying.
Whoah dude sik burn
Donald, can you please dedicate a tweet to the late President Shimon Peres? Make it juicy and funny as usual.
Pretty sure @realDonaldTrump couldn't pick the late Shimon Peres out of a lineup. Who calls Pres. Netanyahu "Bibi"? #ShowOff
Netanyahu is the prime minister.
Nice suit by the way, the tie accentuates your eyes! I had one once...with a briefcase & newspaper but out grew it.
cheated on both your first two wives and who knows you may be cheating on Melania they have Viagra since you're 70. (4/4)
yeah but Ivana and Marla didn't destroy the lives of other women over trump's affairs. Hillary did.
I want more than anything for u to be next pres. Don't waste time on morals of the Clintons...we all know they have none.

lay off the cocaine dude. We worry about your health. A little bit.
What about Hillary's health? Lol. Doctor says 100% healthy as she's literally dying on stage. Side of beef.

So You Like Being Lied To Howard Stern says Donald Trump backed the Iraq War in 2002
the #MSM is on suicide watch. They know it's over!!
Trump is history! He will crash & burn

believe me.


.@realDonaldTrump Reporters aren't supposed to reveal their sources.. Will someone please explain to him how the news works?
According to unnamed sources, Michael Welch has aids from banging the monkeys in his local zoo.
.@DocBrownTF2 Now how would I acquire assistants through fornication with animals? That doesn't make any sense at all! #politicaldebate
My "sources" are legit that is all you need to know. They ask to remain anonymous to avoid violence from Hillary supporters
Key indicator of the REAL fake news
Does it say  "Hi I am a Liar and Lie all of the Time" ?

@TubularPeak @realDonaldTrump Like I don't believe CNN's b.s anymore.

this coming from a chap who prefaces nearly every statement with "lots of people are saying" don't be a hypocrite #trump
is "sources said" the same as your "many people have said"???
@foxnews @FoxBusiness @BretBaier @CarlCameronFOX 
We r with you! Media, including many Fox pundits, are nuts.
so it follows suit with your campaign
ok to a degree U HAVE to rein yrself in U MUST know issues/SPEAK to issues STOP being all over the map ACT like a president
sad!
yes we could hear you breathe on the TV do you think you might have allergies! I just saying please don't take it
.Hillary lies,lies.lies then lies some more!
your campaign team will be good at spotting lies , seeing as they make them up every day #fool
People are tired of hearing about Bill. They want to know what you can do to improve their lives.Let hillary go dirty.
you're sounding desperate donny
get in to reality!  There are probably too many sources
the people don't buy into the bullsh**. Get back on track Miss piggy is old news now! Dig the real DIRT up on Hillary.
don't tell me what to do.
.@realDonaldTrump Yep & sources also say the sun raises in the East & the moon sets in the West. Guess those sources are also lies as well.
ur people that work for u don't even believe u. Just there for pay checks. Greedy people they are. Bet they can't sleep
Every tax-paying citizen should re-evaluate decision to vote for Trump.  He doesn't pay taxes!  He's a crook!
YOu should know lies, it's all that comes out of that asshole of a mouth you have
You claim you won the debate,but have spent the week giving excuses why you didn't. Don't cry take your whipping like a man
"sources say"it wasn't your Dady who made you it was cowards who ran banks that lost millions but didn't liquidate ur ass
#The people know the truth!! LYING  MEDIA! !
.@realDonaldTrump you're a phoney hack! #citrusturd! We ALL know that everything you say is gospel. Desperation is a stinky cologne #loser
I'm sorry my cohorts in the media are so yellow this election. Even Hearst is rolling in his grave. Boycott @nytimes
You mean YOUR "sources" like the CBS post-debate pool (non existent) or the letter you got from the NFL (pants on fire!)
please be calm. Your adoring supporters need you to stop being baited. We don't need U to defend yourself, we need u POTUS
Who really gives a shit?  #NeverTrump #NoWayInHell  I'm a Conservative who will vote for HER to stop HIM! #FNC
.@Kegan05 @realDonaldTrump Remember Benghazi? You're an idiot.  #MAGA
lies: 9/11 talk about this they hate this remember little jebbbie he wouldn't shut up donors pulled $ she's involved
So...the unattractive and/or overweight, yet qualified, hostesses at your golf clubs, did you request they be fired?
Anytime you say "many people are saying" you are making things up. Thanks for admitting it
Let Newt and Rudy bust Clinton out. Stay on message that we want to hear. How to fix this country....
Yes!  Kinda like your "go to" phrase..."many people have said".  I believe you are listening to the voices in your head.
you just can't unfuck the past 50 years. LOSER
No more Mr. Nice guy, Hillary is just a criminal with a silver tongue.
until @kurteichenwald releases the source - then you're F'd eh? Expect more and more of that....multiple times per day ;)
SOURCES LIKE THE "MANY PEOPLE" THT TELL U SHIT! ITS REALLY DEMONIC SPIRIT'S USING U 2 LEAD PPL ASTRAY SO U CAN HV PWR BEAST
PERHAPS BY YOU you liing son of???????. PAY YOUR TAXES
Same when Trump says "people are saying" code for "I'm full of shit"
so you're saying they took a page from your playbook? #liarliar
like when you say "people are telling me" or pretty much anything you say is a lie? #bullshitartist #conman #loser Sad.
Bueno, sí pero los campos de concentración de mexicanos y la expulsión de 11 millones de mexicanos es grave
DON'T LET THE LIES GET YOU DOWN MR TRUMP WE THE PEOPLE KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HILLARY.
stay on hillary
@aduanebrown my sources said you are honest and caring. But i knew they were lying!
The video and interviews clearly confirm you saying "I was told". "Somebody told me" - Daily. What's that about - BS.
just keep hanging yourself. The Rope is getting shorter and shorter.
in your own words, you are a dishonest liar.
unless there's a video of You saying exactly what the story says. Right?
we know 
is that like when you say "people are saying"?
prove it !
oh please, I do my research.  And you lie, all the time.
I don't fat bullies.  And that's what he is.
YOU SAID YES TO JESUS AND THAT'S WHY YOU ARE HATED. JESUS SAID, YOU WILL BE HATED BY MANY FOR MY NAMES SAKE (MATTHEW 10:22)
Yes, of course.
#paranoid
Hello Pot, meet kettle!
Aol has lies about Donald Trump in headlines every day. Would love to know who owns Aol.  Donald-Just stick to the issues
ignore the bull from Hillary  we all know she's a liar  get the new voter on issues
@Kotcha301 ...bravest american 
..@DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @nypost @DineshDSouza @CNN @AnnCoulter @infowars @DailyMailUK
I don't believe anything you say either!
kinda like "we heard" or "I heard" aren't credible either?? The dangling participle will get you every time!!
How about "many people are saying"? Please rate your spokesperson AJ Delgado, she's not up to your standards, chief!
UmmmNo. They are sources, no matter how twump doesn't want them to be.  #ThinSkin #CantHandleTheTruth
Donald is a source, and he does seem to be made up largely of lies.
But it's ok for you to say it? Or should every statement you've made beginning w/this now be regarded as a lie?

You're the expert on lying.
so then this a lie, right?
. Replace "sources" with "democrats"
Many people are saying @realDonaldTrump is falling apart at the seams.
So, when @realDonaldTrump uses the "Many people are saying", and "I've heard from some people"...he's openly admitting HE'S lying. Bravo!
Why blame Mexicans and Chinese for taking America's jobs when its wealthy CEOs sending jobs overseas to increase profits
Hillary Clinton gets away with everything & you need to just go for it !
lol Thats funny
but everyone is suppose to believe everything you say with no proof
but when you reference sources we should believe them? and  you lie all the time....
ketchup
So, pretty much like everything that comes out of your obnoxious word hole then, right?
Right...this coming from someone who said "i've heard from a very credible SOURCE that Obama wasn't born in the US."  Idiot
A lot of people, really great people, are talking about what a liability you are.
We belive she can't be trusted #FollowTheMoney #SayAnyThing
Sources told me Donald Trump never tweeted this. - @mike_pence
Sir. Listen to your campaign. By giving attention to the rumors, your hurting your chances. Focus on Hillary.
Kind of like when you say "People are telling me..."
it doesn't surprise us that you have no sources. Explains a lot
what are your sources for that statement? #facts #evidence
release your tax return!!!!
please stop commenting on the traps Hillary  camps is setting for u. Stick n stones Donald
How about, "I read it on FB"? What a lame looser, DT!
Donald, what are we to believe? All I know this S---.has to stop,If
you want this Veterans Vote.PLEASE! Talk about Problems
Every time Trump says "many credible sources", you know his nose gets longer.
Sources say that's not true. They aren't telling lies.
THERE IS NOTHING QUALIFYING ABOUT YOUR ELIGIBILITY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. FIRST OF ALL, RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS.
Hillary supporters do not do what they do, believe,  or why they do so. They are blind, yet they claim that they can see.
The devils job is to still, kill, and destroy, so he will definitely use his daughter "Hitlery Clinton" to do so. #Focus!
@StefanMolyneux I don't care if you hold a press conference saying I personally suck, I am voting trump2016
press on forget the Hillary  petty BS
wow!!  commas, important. This is awesome
The more the media and the Hillary people attack - the more worried they are.
We don't Mr. Trump, we will defend your honor on Facebook and twitter! #Trump2016
the sources are screenshots of your own tweets before you deleted them you braggadocios, orange, airbag
But believe without question "People are saying".  
LOL
This is getting sad Donnie. Just go home already.
Said the guy who can't back any of his claims with proof.
like the lies you make up?
I'll believe whomever the hell I choose. YOU are not on that list.
No Sources, but Sorcerers!
@FilmCollboratve You're tough for them be courageous
you mean *from* me or my campaign?

I TOTALLY AGREE, IT WAS SICKING HEARING ALL THE ATTACK ON YOU. WE SPOT TO 120 CHRISTIAN ABOUT YOU. MAKING CALLS NEXT!
someone sold you dank. The paranoia is out of control

Obama and Clinton funded ISIS according to the CIA.  IF you need he url, I wil get it for you.
