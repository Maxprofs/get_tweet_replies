No, it's NOT OK. Your support for  #LiarInChief drives us closer to a democratic meltdown. He called #Constitution & 1st Amendment "archaic"
@barbaralusk7 Your tweets might be taken seriously if you could spell. Showing (again) the #stupidity of #CultOfTrump Use a "dickshunairy"
Just the beginning of #LiarInChief trying to dismantle our democracy. Or did you miss the part where he called our #constitution "archiac" ?
For the people? That's a joke. Trump is about Trump. As long as he and his buddies are making money, that's what's important.
POTUS  HAS 3 HEADACHES 
HYSTERICAL DEMS 
GOP WHO CAN'T GET OUT OF THEIR OWN WAY 
BIASED MEDIA 
POTUS  FOR THE PEOPLE 
ALL AMERICANS UNITE!
The beginning of the end.
What about "OF the People". Cheez! You can even quote Lincoln correctly.
Of the CORPORATIONS, by the CORPORATIONS and FOR THE CORPORATIONS

Ha! caught ya again toying with number of likes on this video Typical leftard business. Count me done with @twitter

Love our President here in MI, USA!
Where's the WALL that was promised?!! Where's Obamacare repeal?! Yep, Trump caved. Bowed down.
Thankful to God HE chose you to lead our country! Thank you President Trump for accepting the job
USA needs you to MAGA!
RT @charliekirk11: 100 days ago a new message, leader, &amp; movement took the Oval Office! A government FOR the people ...
I still love this moment in time
the beginning of the END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the beginning of the circus
...of the end.
I just can't anymore
Liberalism + hypocrisy
'Broken by US power machine': Trump’s 100 days prove his maverick image was fake.
Good job Mr. President good job
President Donald J. Trump has tweeted over 470 times since Inauguration, mentioning Democrats 36 times and fake news 30 times.

I'm one of the people. I don't feel my values are represented by you and those on your staff. If the alt right is satisfied, my USA is gone
A government for the 1% by the 1%.
It's the end of human decency
@realDonaldTrump  you mean FOR the WHITE people BY the WHITE people. #LetsBeHonest
Thank God for Trump ! Anyone against him, is against me, and millions of Americans!  @tbeaux29 @Kyle_AZ_ @Fully_C @sillybot_ @wink_nod
Ah yes, the old, if you don't worship this man you must hate your country thing. It's still bullshit.
Old Typical lib sh!T yell hater & racist.... All they have
Low emotional intelligence
Where did I say anything about anyone being racist??? I'm saying you can disagree with the president and still love your country.
I do not always agree with him but by far he was the best for quality of life from the choices for short and long term.
@realDonaldTrump @charliekirk11 please Don. You government is not for the people. It is a modern oligarchy, did you learn that from Russia?
Understand why @POTUS @VP #Sessions #Jared all lie about #TrumpRussia.  They either need to keep lying or quit. How about the rest of @GOP?

For very thick people by very thick people
OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP !!!
Looking at FEC paperwork from 2015 through 2016 on Turning Point... odd how a lot of these Maryland donors seem connected.
OF THE END!!!
Yup. The beginning of the end. Can't wait to get him out!
You are a gift to comedic writers and a joke to the world. Unfortunately, the fallout will not be a joke...unfathomable,

The beginning of the end??? #WTF
That's a joke, right? If you mean FOR the people you mean for the Trump family and if you mean BY the people, you mean by the Trump family!
Lair, so far its been the most corrupt in American history. A government 4 trump's people by trump's people. No 1 else counts 2 him
Proverbs 16:3
Commit your works to the Lord, And your thoughts will be established.
Why do you keep quoting the Old Testament? As a Christian God told you specifically to ignore it. I mean you read the Bible right?
For which people? A minority? Lol
hahahaha. We voted for him. Half of America. Most was from Hollywood.
It's going to take more than 100 days with what he's had to deal with.
Sadly they block him at every turn then ask why he hasn't done anything
"they" being his own party, the IC, our allies, the media and the judiciary. All of whom he mocks. What do you expect? #MarchForTruth
They expect all of America to be a safe space for their lies and prejudice. True snowflakes: white people who get scared of non-white things
Remember his promises? Look at all he's accomplished... Oh, that's right. He didn't accomplish a single thing he promised!
Just the beginning... of the investigations into your ties to Russia.
It's concentrated, baby. No dilution here.
#trump100days
And your first quarter brought the worst economy growth in 3 years. SAD!
What do you expect! He had to fix Obama's fuck up first !  @tbeaux29 @sillybot_ @Fully_C @Kyle_AZ_ @wink_nod @ArmyofKek @moonlitepath17
Fix Obamas mess up huh? That's why we had 3 years of amazing growth until Trumps first quarter?  #LogicFail
Come march with us. The #climatemarch is the real news today.
Another march accomplishing nothing. Have a few more.
Marches raise awareness to issues.
Some good examples: Martin Luther King's marches, women's rights marches.
People that don't like the Republican agenda cannot change things just because they march.
Coincidence? 
I think not!

Amazing the Left can't see this! I'm perplexed by the absolute HATE they spew
If you paid taxes, you'd be upset this game show host's family was robbing you blind, too.
Please cite ANY/ALL examples of OUR President robbing us blind.
Thank you
#MAGA
1. He's charging the government (our taxes) to use his businesses is the most obvious and straightforward.
Next most obvious is using our taxes to pay businesses he holds stock in. This is why a blind trust is important.
This is absolutely childish and ridiculous to believe this. Grow up.
And yet it's factually true. Imagine that.
I enjoy watching seemingly intelligent people who willingly make fools of themselves promoting crazy socialistic conspiracies bc they lost
Sorry, but AAAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!
I mean they can say fake news?? They only believe what is feed to them.  They are unable to look deeper. Yet do they watch him speak? Wow!
They know he is a liar, a thief and a vulgar mess of a human being, perhaps they see themselves in him, minus the money.
@realDonaldTrump 

SHOW US YOUR TAXES, COMRADE!
Yawn..
Donald Trump did more on his First day, than any Democrat could have done in 100 days! He kept Hillary from office Thank You Mr. President!!
#draintheswamp
#MAGA
So much golf...
Better so much vacation we payed for bet he pays his way golfing
Idiots, that's his domain. That's where he has meetings and makes deals. Idiots everywhere

For the people By the people.
Could have fooled me with all the Trump business' being promoted by his office. Starting to think all forTrump
Gee. To think, we fought Revolution but had to wait 200 years for a reality TV character to get gov't by and for the people #KeepAmericaGood
The beginning of the end, I'm guessing
U have not delivered yet/repeal&replace Obamacare/where the hell is it/stop the crap/kick ass & get it done/spending bill sucks/dems love it
Hahaha.  Tiny hands
Less and less people are buying into the lie.
100 days ago, we all fell through the looking glass.
He wasn't the president then. So who cares what his taxes say.  Who cares what he made last year when he was just a normal American citizen
A government for the Trump family to enrich their coffers and their friends as well. Draining the swamp? HAHAHAHAHA
Some of the people ...
Fool. For the people? What a joke. For his families pockets. Greed, pure greed.
For the RICH, By the RICH, and whatever Goldman Sachs tells him to do. That is how he rules. Rules being a laughable word with him.
The beginning... of the end!
No one cares
And he hasn't kept one single 100 day promise, thank God! #LockHimUp
Other than promoting hatred he has kept one of his campaign promises he has drain the swamp although only to filled it with raw sewage.
You lie just like your leader. What a disaster this do nothing presidency has been so far. He makes American shitty with every exec order.
The beginning of the end. How sad for our nation that such an ignoramus is in charge. Not even sure how he made it through grade school.
Yeah, OF the Russians, BY the Russians. Don't think we've forgotten. And your #First100Days were LEAST successful of ANY pres. Go play golf.
@realDonaldTrump a government for $$$$$ for the Trump family by the Trump family
Yes nice
#Impeach45 #TheResistance #dumptrump
Hey, Hey, Hey. Goodbye

The Incompetence Doctrine https://warontherocks.com/2017/05/the-incompetence-doctrine/ … @WarOnTheRocks
Great does that mean you are leaving
Beginning of what? This is the man who JUST tweeted he wants to shutdown the government.
Great day for America.
No it's the end.
The beginning of the end of the United States of America. I give it less than 100 more days until we become the United States of Russia.
Then illegally taking right to speak away is it "For the people By the people"?  and then threatening during investigations- obstruction!
the only movement that's new is the McDonald's-laden bowel movement the orange fascist poops into the Royal White House terlit.

You're doing a great job! - - - despite your opposition Keep it up!  We love you and at praying for your success... Psalm 71
Come on Charlie anticipation @a great pace
@realDonaldTrump poor Charlie, you drank the Kool aid didn't you?

trump is dismantling our democracy....
Not by us. You mean by the Russians.
Leader?
100 days and you still haven't filled hundreds of administration positions. Most likely because you have no family or friends left to use.
END IT NOW!
@realDonaldTrump #alternativefacts
ALREADY Broken Promises:  His taxes, Mexico pays for wall, he HAS better healthcare program, he HAS plan to defeat ISIS, swamp, Syria, etc
Saddest day in American history
Government FOR Kleptocracy and building Oligarchy NOT average people....ONLY wealthy. Charlie doesnt get diff types of Governments or BAD.
Happy happy day
As much as I like you Kirk, you are delusional 
The campaigning Trump isn't the POTUS Trump
@realDonaldTrump So far this has been the worst thing that ever happened to America since September 11 take down of WTC.
BULLSHIT! #notmypresident
For the people?  By the people?  Please substantiate those claims w/ facts, as all I see are midguided fools and an il-equipped WH.
There is nothing for the people from this administration. Unless you are rich, he has no use for you. He has gone back on all promises.
Stop it
Poor Charlie - the majority of Americans didn't elect him.
Unless of course those people are immigrants, woman, or the poor. #WorstPresidentEver
Release your tax returns.
God, it feels like 100 years.
We know, we know, the democracy will be dead before we know it, just "give you a chance......"............to kill it. Fascist fuhrer.
You misspelled For the Billionaires, by the Billionaires ...
Just beginning of a scandal bigger than watergate. Orange square ass should follow Nixon &  step down. Save the country from pain of trial
God help us all... we'll need it.
You are letting dems still call shots. Why? You have WH, Senate, etc. What is going on? I have been ur #1 supporter i am so disappointed
@realDonaldTrump actually the MAJORITY of the people voted for the other candidate, not Donald Trump.
Problems with repealing Obamacare comes to price increase control. I'd like  costs of military service hospital health baseline compared.
Make a difference between civilian doctors and military doctors negligible by making America great again you're making military = civilian.
Trump and his administration have done nothing "for the people " !!!#TrumpRussiaTies #ImpeachTrump
btw, you are going straight to hell for lying whilst your hand was on the bible.
If this is just the beginning, then we are seriously screwed
#LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL  It's a government by an #Ignoramus, benefiting his #EvilSpawn from multiple #BabyMommas #Impeachment
The beginning of our downfall!  Elected by the uneducated, his ppl who do not know how government works, nor the history of our nation!
The people voted for someone else.
@realDonaldTrump DidU 4get "of the people"?
He'll be remembered as a joke, a stain, an embarrassment.
They get paid no matter where they are... do you people think the secret service only gets paid when Trump goes somewhere? Use your heads.
加油川普
@realDonaldTrump ...Government by the people? His advisors are his daughter and son-in law? Aristocracy government!
shits in his pants often
Nobody important likes you.
Stop Lying. Stop perpetrating the division YOU are causing. Release Your Taxes. Get Educated. Understand you are not loved by all.
Are you insane?
Of the end.....
Donny get some gonads and tell congress no vacation next week, stay in town and get some shit done
The beginning of WHAT?!? A great country that is being destroyed by a tyrannical and basically insane President?!
Right....you are as nuts as him....see you at the impeachment.
You apparently don't know the definition of some of the words you chose there...
Looked at your numbers, lately?  If this is the beginning, the end can't be far behind!
@potus is a Useless bag of bones w/ #Mush4Brains & hasn't restored anything. He's #AllAboutDistroyingAmerica #Worst100DaysEver
@RandyRainbow interviews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I think this is his best one yet. LOL! Wait for it :) https://youtu.be/TPg0BWvhMkA  #resistance

CHARLIE! How does it feel to publicly support a Dictator. Facts matter. Trump lies. YOU...Support that. Shame on you and you family. 
Sorry you missed out 2 words...FOR the Billionaire people BY the BIllionaire people.
@TomiLahren don't get how you're pro choice but work wth a bunch of white washed conservatives...oh wait
You mean by the "rich" people, right? I have yet to see an "average" person be put on his administration.
It's the beginning of  the end
You have ignored the people and created policies that support you the rich and corporations not the people
