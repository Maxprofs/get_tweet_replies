How about the four Green Berets who were killed in Niger? No mention of them? Some president...lower case intended. Too busy being a racist and trying to exact retribution for some perceive slight to attend to things of importance.
You’ll pay more taxes too!!

@realDonaldTrump  stand up against ATA they do not represent truckers or small business #eldorme
Where would we be without our farmers.......
FAKE SUPPORT
Too Bad you’re Gonna Put then out of business
Had to find a way to make it about yourself. Shocking 
Break up the monopolies of Monsanto, Cargill, etc, allow farmers to pick their seeds to feed the world with healthy, non GMO food

Did they rub your tummy and tell you what a good boy you are?
Yeah you're helping farmers - they don't have anyone to pick crops because ICE has deported all their workers.  Alternate reality MAGA
Don’t Forget tomorrow is #HappyMoronsDay
stop tweeting and get your sweaty ass to work. we're sick of your fucking tweets, mate.
Thanks for looking out for our Bread & Butter to go with our Steaks & Bacon!
Farmers are as American as apple pie 
Thus Democrats probably hate 'em 
#MAGA
Farmers; one of the most subsidized group of businesses in the country, oil isn’t far behind






Yep!
They will call a mental illness after him someday.

Retreat' played at military base during Trump/Hannity interview Neither stood and Trump joked it was playing for Seans ratings #Disrespect
Yeah, you give a shit? Give me a bigly break.
Couldn't just be about the farmers, could it? You had to make it about you.
With his signature like a heart monitor on someone who just had 6 Lucozades.
Thank God for Farmers!
Glad to have a @POTUS who puts America First!
The Left has tried to destroy farming in California. President Trump is doing a fantastic job helping to make sure American farmers thrive!
California Ag is with Trump! #NationalFarmersDay
American Farmers have a friend in the @POTUS! #MAGA  https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/821173712439259136/video/1 …
Whatever bro
Farmers hate Trump.
#legalizeandempathize   let them grow the most abundant of all plants. Marijuana will save and empower lives.
Wishing them a happy day will go far with them as they cope with growing crops in a changing climate.

Is there ANYTHING you do that isn’t about you?
Heard you were gonna plant some bird seed to get some tweety birds to grow!

This might give you a smile !!

Trump is nasty a liar a racist a promoted of violence he buys 
His crowd he pays them to cheer california burning n trump celebrating
Not sure who paid that group of idiots
The farmers around me would like to put a big boot in your ass Donnie
NAFTA Nazi BS is killin' corn

When your back and rested it would be a great idea to go to a farmers market.
Happy #25thAmendmentDay! It's #MuellerTime! How will you be celebrating, with corn dogs and groping Ivanka? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution …
Thank you, Sir.
The loss of so many family farms in my lifetime is terrible loss of Ag-reality, especially in face of population doubling global pollution…!
Mr.Trump, I am a 22-year-old Albanian boy. I am impressed and inspired by your abilities to win, shown throughout your career. #BigGoals
President Trump is a self-made billionaire with a winning temperament. That’s what it took to turn around this country in the wake of Obama
Obama waged class warfare in an attempt to liquidate the middle class, putting American in European-like economic malaise
The globalist Hollywood elite want to stop the Trump Presidency and upend democracy! We won’t let them!
When will @JoeBiden be held accountable for his creepy behavior?
Why does the left not call out @JoeBiden?

Impeach this fucking nightmare of a monster. This Russian puppet. This money-laundering fool. This racist Nazi fuck.
We're trying, we're trying
Farmers??  what are you thining. this mad is a" swamp, people "
What about #DayoftheGirl Yesterday?  No mention of that?
Trump only recognizes those who he knows voted for him.  Mr. President, you represent all of us.  Start acting like it!
There is so much going on in America, and while Farmers are of utmost importance, you ignore the majority of Americans who aren't farmers.  You ignore women, minorities and those who don't give you their loyalty.  That is not how Presidents should act!

No farmers no billionaires!
Does Donny even know what a farm  farmer is doubt it
#lowIQtrump WHAT ABOUT PUERTO RICO trump? When will you really help those Americans! Their deaths are on your hands!
Too bad the farmers of America do not like you!
One million chickens a day are boiled alive in USA (pigs also boiled alive in USA)
BS. GOP deregulation reduced family farming to today's meager 1% of U.S. GDP. Thanks a lot for mega Agribusiness, GMOs & Monsanto.

I am thinking of all the wineries going up in flames and many people dying in CA. Do you even care, Trump?

Don't get too close to the pigs ! Someone might pen you up !
Delay eld
No farming in Puerto Rico today!- Fucking Moron"- Rex T
Do these farmers know you’re cutting school lunch programs that bought their surplus crops?  One made them money, two fed the kids at school
Thanks to all our hardworking farmers!!!!
Go work at one!
Indeed - our farms and farmers are crucial to our survival - lest we forget
Liar
Happy Nacional Farmers Day!!!!
Sad

How much you pay for holding those  signs up , and show people support you?
Nice opp for an agricultural photo. Instead, you chose one that doesn't celebrate farmers, just "Farmers for Trump".
#boycotttrumphotels

I am thai,from Thailand,i loved you and respect in you spirit,for you country

The problem with this is he'll be proud of it because it called him a powerful man.  Clueless Loser Trump.
#25thAmendment
Yeah Dotard you are the shining example of farmers and old mcdonald.
We should all be pissed with NBC for airing the Apprentice in the first place. This is all their fault!


Yellow and green signs? Them's @JohnDeere colors. My grandfather retired from farming in 1974. He was a lifelong IH man.  Go plow yourself.
Mention your tax cuts while you at it, sure they will be happy with that
Thank you sir, for acknowledging and respecting a lot of folks (who are forgotten) who keep this country great.
Did you ask those farmers how they feel about you scrapping nafta?
Happy at a mass rally.  Hitler felt the same way
Thank You Mr. President. Pictured....our beautiful Ohio cornfields. God Bless 
My family has a farm in Fairfield County. Ohio is BEAUTIFUL and the people are friendly!!! 
We live in rural Ohio, many gorgeous farms around us. Love it!!  
U know nothing abt farming or u wld protect bees.U do not even know what I am talking abt. No bees,  no food.75 percent killed by poison.
Ah, what have you "farmed" in your life other than women?  @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump
Why do they have to be holding trump signs? You seriously cannot help but make everything about you. #25thAmmendment
The hayseeds love Trump.
wjat can trump possibly know about farming??? Growin' turnips up on Trump tower are ya?
Sadly the farmers in PR whom are also American citizens lost all their crops.
Thanks to all farmers.
Food is real important to the strength of our nation.
Most people would show a picture of the farmers doing their jobs.  Not you, you make it about you. 
Wonder how many farms have burned in CA? You know about the , right? Oh, yeah...let the liberals burn.
You do realize crops are rotting because immigrants are afraid to work because of you. Like a locust everything you touch you destroy.
the farmers in the #CaliforniaWildfires arent having an happy day. And you arent even acknowledging our pain. Ridiculous.
IM POOR MAKE ME RICH OK MEN OF WHITE ORIGIN BYE

They know bullsh*t when they see it!
Really...farmers?! The @EPAScottPruitt approves poisonous pesticides, which kills the bees and they grow food u can’t eat.  Feed it to DT!!

God bless farmers!!  Without them, we’d starve to death because I do Not have a green thumb!!!

What are you going to threaten the farmers with?!! FUCKING ASSHOLE!
Yo, Don! Word is they’re going to take you out by invoking the 25th Amendment. Oh, and Mueller & Schneiderman will greet you with open arms!
STOP THIS LOBBYING SCUM FROM ILLEGAL INVADERS! Give big dollars to politicians to flood our Country with criminals

#America's #children are disappointing knowing nothing, doing nothing w/#SkilledTrade #Farmers #Plumber name it!

You just made it impossible for a farmer to get medical care.  #TwentyFifthAmendment
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF OUR HARD WORKING FARMERS! THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT!GOD BLESS OUR FARMERS!  #NationalFarmersDay 
Do you seriously have to make everything about you? Just posting a picture of a farm with the cow. Keep it simple stupid.

Pop quiz: How many farmers lost their land/homes in CA this week? You don’t even care. Resign already. Failure. #ImpeachTheFailure45
Yes
Are you meaning the same farmers and ranchers who are selling off their land, left and right for a huge profit to developers?
Like, how many farmers can there be?!
what about our farmers in Santa Rosa who's homes are burned to the ground? Will you pay any attention to them?
I live in the salad bowl of US. This is a joke. They are concerned that the EPA is going to destroy everything they work so hard for.
LMAO
Make sure Marxist Canadian dairy, beef get fixed in NAFTA.
Trump’s upbeat Puerto Rico rhetoric clashes with reality on the ground
Abolish Estate Tax that are sending farmers to poverty!!! Socialist marxist free loader assh.. tax enslaving people to oblivion!!!
How FAKE is that picture #FAKENEWS #FAKEPRESIDENT
Also: a photo filled with people you couldn’t give less of a flying fuck about. #NationalFarmersDay
Really -- like you give two shits about farmers, they are like your daughter Tiffany on your list, or Baron/Eric.
As if you truly care about them.

JACOB WOHL IS A BRAIN WASHED TRUMP BRAND DEPUBLICAN ! HE SWINGS WHICH EVER WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING.
