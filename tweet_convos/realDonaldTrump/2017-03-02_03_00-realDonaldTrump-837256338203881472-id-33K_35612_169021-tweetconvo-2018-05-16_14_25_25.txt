Nice try, but Russia is the only story that matters.
Jeff Sessions lied to Congress. #TREASON #RUSSIA #TrumpRussia #TrumpTiesTrumpLies #GOPCoverUpCollusion
we aren't forgetting about Russia. This story is only getting bigger. #TrumpRussia #TREASON
@jasoninthehouse We need an independent, bipartisan investigation into @jeffsessions and your ties to Putin. #TREASON
Jeff Sessions is just the tip of the iceberg. #RUSSIA #TREASON #TrumpRussia
Jeff Sessions needs to go. #RUSSIA #TREASON #TrumpRussia
What does #presidentbannon think about Jeff Sessions lying to Congress? #TrumpRussia #TREASON #RUSSIA
It's not the act, Sessions. It's the lie. #Russia #Trumprussia
1. You weren't in office till over 2 months later
2. Stock markets gains means $ for bankers, not jobs for ppl
You yourself have said you avoid the stock market... why do you keep pumping it so hard when prices are overinflated?
It's not like we've had $3 trillion in increased economic output since the election—this is all hype & you know it.
If anything, ur policies will result in companies losing money. They may temporally create a few jobs but at a grater cost
What this will do, though, is increase the rate of automation which is the real cause of job loss—not China/Mexico!
Don't believe me? Watch what happens when you order something from Amazon. This factory is in the US—not China/Mexico.
Also, this happened shortly after your meeting with Boeing...
 NICE  WORK 
"shrinking its workforce... as the company streamlines operations"
This means automation in case u can't put 2 & 2 together
Keep telling yourself this, Donald. You have to keep telling yourself things are going well. The reality will crush you.
Russia. Russia. Russia. That is the wind that is circling you. First Flynn. Then Sessions. Keep talking through the storm.
But if you want to talk the economy, let's start with the travel industry.
oh wow, really? You sincerely believe that's what is putting me and millions of Europeans off?
'Trump is popular in Europe.' Wow. 2 million Britons have signed a petition to stop his State Visit.
Clear you don't understand how the economy works, but happy to take credit for anything that (falsely) makes you look good!
Stop shouting random words like "jobs!" Anyone can do that. Russia! Perjury! Golden showers! Anti-Semitism! Racism! SAD!
Speaking of which, y'all are sleeping w/ Russia so much you've got bed sores. When's he resigning?
?! "Officials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers’ questions..." https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/837121980436369410 …
what is the source you got this from?
can you not read
idiot I'm not a trump supporter, I check sources before I believe something. I have not heard this in any publication
The news broke last night. I believe in both the @washingtonpost & @nytimes. It was all over twitter. @Mike_P_Williams
Sessions talked to Russian Ambassador,  but said under oath he didn't
Thanks Obama, Fantastic work!
You've cost the american tax payers more in 30 days than obama did in a year, your not worth the expense honey.






.@realDonaldTrump don't forget to give a special shoutout to Goldman Sachs–stock rose 40% since election–you hired its COO Cohn as adviser
.@realDonaldTrump and Cohn is so committed to the D.C. gig, he lives out of a $450/night hotel near the White House
17. Oh look, Goldman is a huge investor in Kushner family biz, and so he picks GS president Gary Cohn to be Trump's chief economic adviser 
can you explain why billion $ salaried businessmen are going through this scrutiny to accept a job that pays $400k?
.@GodDamners Cohn is pushing for the $1 trillion infrastructure plan Wilbur Ross crafted and will get a nice cut
15. Kushner plant, Goldman's president Cohn, is telling Trump the private-industry partner scheme, widely panned by economists, is sound 
The same Cohen that had to explain to Trump how much his infrastructure plan would cost.
Trump's economic adviser Cohn wants a weak dollar, so Trump calls…Mike Flynn, at 3 AM…to verify @MartinMcCoyIII @GodDamners @starlitroom
WHAT ABOUT SESSIONS LYING UNDER OATH ABOUT HIS CONTACT WITH RUSSIA? (Courtesy of @nytimes)
p.s. The market going gangbusters? what happens when a prosperous Obama economy is fed on by capitalist wolves...
...smelling the blood of deregulation. Fossil fuels, pharma, health insurance- all posting colossal gains...
who has appointed the worst most unqualified cabinet in history- Exxon & Goldman Sachs clowns. But what's so frustrating...
is that it all is so cliché- the big business villains of our literature, the cartoonish King Pins have come to roost...
& even still your fall will be so typical when we follow the money right back to Russia & its murderer dictator president
only it won't be Batman or Superman who undo this towering evil, but pissed off M'er F'ing citizens of the U.S.A. #resist
Here's the video of Sessions denying **under oath** that he had communications with the Russians.
If @realDonaldTrump has nothing 2 hide, why is he so opposed 2 the truth coming out, asks @MalcolmNance #TrumpRussia
New Trump loves his TelePrompTer. Old racist troll Trump mocked Obama for using one.
. This retired admiral says we deserve the truth on your #Russia ties. @foxandfriends @morning_joe!
#RussiaHacking @realDonaldTrump Got Some Explaining to do
Who needs leaks. Just watch this.
Before U solve the problems of the world,start by opposing Russian cyberattacks on USgov& elections. #TreasonousTrump
"@realDonaldTrump Dnt hide behind my son's death 2 prevent an investigation"-father of slain Navy Seal on Yemen raid
YES! Those GAINS are NICE and entirely due to our GENIUS! More important: Let's make sure nobody talks about SESSIONS!
Talking about SESSIONS would be SAD! And BAD! And treacherous! After all, what did he do wrong?
He did NOTHING wrong, just like FLYNN, whom we fired NOT because he did anything wrong, but because... because...
STOP talking about SESSIONS! And about FLYNN! Let's talk about other things. Like stocks. Like the Academy Awards. WIN!

Man, that RHYMED. We are winning so bigly today, it's not even funny!
#triggered every time I see one of your troll post I'm donating $5 to #Trumps RE-election bid
.@realDonaldTrump You inherited a strong market.
ANOTHER member of Trump's cabinet was found with Russian ties—& even lied under oath to conceal them! Naturally, Trump brags about jobs:
and then just shouts the word 'Jobs!' for absolutely no reason, how are people buying this s***?!
.@a_damp_owl jobs! jobs! jobs! [becomes millionaire]
remember republicans shouting "jobs jobs jobs" under Obama yet they blocked everything and wouldn't create jobs? I do
The Russian Ambassador sat in front row of Trumps foreign policy speech during campaign.
Richard Burt who wrote Trumps foreign policy speech on board of Alfa bank..same Rus bank had activity Trump Tower server
Donald Trump JR+Devos also connected to Rus Alfa Bank
and the FBI had FISA warrants out on 2 Russian Banks..Alfa bank one of them ..see @LouiseMensch article..Sberbank the other
so does this mean Hillary and James Comey have ties to China cause they did business with HSBC? #fakenews
Did Hillary gain $19B in shares of #Russia oil giant (Rosneft) for promising to lift Russia sanctions?
#Trump did
.@realDonaldTrump "Jobs!"... you put a hiring freeze in place, meaning we can't hire anyone for our open positions... sir
.@realDonaldTrump oh and we didn't forget about Sessions lying under oath to congress about Russia, nice try though!!!
.@realDonaldTrump you and your gang of wrinkly jabronis might get a nice check from RUS, but we like our potatoes from Idaho not RUS bro!

Anyone who takes their world view from the Huffington post, can't ever be taken seriously. All Huff N puff.
I take my view from a) research B) what may now be up to over 30k MH professionals. That alone needs reporting
The stock market may be up, but money is not the most important value, @realDonaldTrump. Jeff Sessions must resign. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837256338203881472 …
And who will fill these "high-paying" jobs?  I read there are 200,000 construction jobs going begging

If true, you get a pass.
Thanks Obama!
are you still campaigning? She lost and I could care less about her now  you're such a precious snowflake 
must try harder to troll  I would recommend having an original thought 
"recommend having an original thought" u started this w "Thanks Obama".V original.Hypocrite just like ur pres
Under Obama, America experienced the longest sustained growth in jobs in history. He cut unemployment by more than half.
you must live in an alternative reality
Ha! Good one!
I am calling for a complete & total shutdown of @realDonaldTrump's administration until we figure out what the hell is going on. #russiagate
shit the whole freaking congress down that support DTs corruption.  Get them out of there.
you mean Obama's corruption right the guy was a joke
Psst @AbdellClifton,@realDonaldTrump is President now, you can stop talking about @POTUS44 #deflection #TrumpApologist #RussianTroll #resist
Obama grew the Dow by 235% and cut unemployment in half. Americans are indebted to him for  MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
that's absolutely hysterical...Obama was a complete nightmare
Ha! Good one!
stocks are also up because Trump is deregulating = kill environment & make bankers richer
He's also had 2 EO's aimed at allowing companies to lower wages.
and his budget reduces EPA funding by 90%!
Under Obama, the Dow grew from 7949 to nearly 20,000. The greatest increase in history. You’ve got a long way to go.
that jump after the election was just a coincidence, I suppose. Liberal butthurt is more #winning
Ha! Good one!
Here is what a commander in chief looks like during a properly vetted successful raid #InvestigateYemen
show the one where @HillaryClinton was asleep. #benghazi
I am fine with that then we can show the one with Trump tweeting during Yemen raid
'I will be interviewed by @TheBrodyFile on tonight at 11pm. Enjoy!' Trump wrote on 28/1. Tweet deleted 20 minutes later.
He got the date wrong it was actually on the 29th lol
Hey guys! If you really want Trump to hear you! Talk to him here! @countable gave me this 4 U http://Www.talktotrump.org 
To answer if he will really get your video the answer is Yes' He will! Don't miss your chance! Talk 2 Him!

Your Attorney General lied to Congress and spoke to the Russians while serving your campaign. 

Easy on that victory lap.
.@realDonaldTrump Is Jeff Sessions one of those "Jobs!"? If so, might be down one this week, right? Russia!
thanks Obama!

did they announce you as President, too?

.@realDonaldTrump
Thanks to Obama! Now, back to Russia. Why were ur people talking to Russia & why are they lying now
what's that in rubles?
Probably not going to distract America from the Session DISASTER. MORE Trump campaign connections with Russia. Bad hombre!
.@realDonaldTrump dude that's not what that means, it means your rich, asshole friends have gotten richer & they AREN'T spreading the wealth
.@realDonaldTrump I find your basic lack of understanding of how the world works for the vast majority of America deeply pathetic.
Buuut it provides thousands of jobs. So in the end isn't that what matters?
Just because the are Mexicans doesn't mean they are not US citizens.
.@realDonaldTrump last year, I paid in taxes more money than my dad ever made one year in his life. Release your taxes, and deport yourself.
And yet confidence in the President remains at an all-time low. Maybe that's because money isn't the answer to everything.
Yes, please talk about how you're still riding Obama's economy & not how deep the Russians are into your administrstion.
Job! Thanks, President Obama!
- And your approval rating is at a historic low. Show us your taxes.
Since November 8th, Election Day, the Stock Market has posted $3.2 trillion in GAINS and consumer confidence is at a 15 year high. Jobs!
.@realdonaldtrump Fuck you.
.@realDonaldTrump You killed a Navy SEAL while you ate dinner, you're laundering money for Russia, and all your boys are in on it. #Sessions
And you feel this is your doing? Seriously??
we're not forgetting Russia. Good try though! If anyone in the GOP had a spine you'd be gone already 

But what about #Sessions? He lied. There's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEPRZQSEmSI … and a petition: https://goo.gl/xKdR7o 
your predecessor did an exceptional job restoring our economy.
invest in lawyers... you and your buddies will need them
still Obama's economic! You haven't done anything yet! Remember orange clown running  circus!  
THE GAINS STARTED BEFORE YOU TOOK OVER. OBAMA'S WORK WAS THE REASON THE MARKETS CHANGED.
Uh...no...really..."Trumpie The Con-Man Clown" already has the "WORST PREZ" title locked up! BWAH-HA-HA-HA
Your picture is right above JESUS pic at Dan Pena's Castle seminar!MAGA
Congratulations, President Trump! I always knew you were the man to do the job! Way to go!
you cant just add up every positive tick. That's gross (gain and stupidity). The value that matters is NET gain. #LearnMath
Stocks dont indicate actual value, only perceived. Usually manipulated by deception/fraud. A lot like your own self-value.
God Bless President Trump, GOD & AMERICA is on your side! Thank you for fighting for us, Mr. Trump! We love you!
RECESS APPOINT A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL...take back control of OUR government!!!!
And here comes inflation. Nothing exists in a vacuum, except what is in your skull
It has been rising to those levels since 2009 & yours is just froth on the coffee - you love taking credit for anything.
You have let me down with who you pick but i still see potential in you. You would have to let them go Mr.. President
I agree stock market made $3.2 trillion + GAINS but how many $trillions in LOSSES? Talk about FAKE NEWS.
Please make sure to tweet when the SM goes into free fall and corrects by 30%. Will you man up & take credit for that too?
You can thank Obama for the strong economy you inherited. With 6 bankruptcies under your belt, the fate of the US is grim.
.This is the real made for Tv reality..Your getting Impeached and charged for treason....Cant wait for those ratings...
Until you can actually show policies that result in job growth and not stock market growth, just
The stock market is emotional. You are a drama queen. It will react to your theatrics. It doesn't mean more than that.
In your deluded mind it does.
i think it is more enffiency to cooperate with other countries to make America great again.
and you are the cause of the rise!
how many jobs have you ended?
no thanks to you. Thank you President Obama! The market will crash soon then you can blame President Obama for that. Loser!
you took office 1/17.... So most of the time from 11/8/16 to 1/17/17 was....?  ..... Whom?
@FoxNews Put that in your marijuana pipes and smoke at MSN CNN and some at Fox News
.@realDonaldTrump - not a surprise given the great, really great number of billionaires you've stacked the cabinet with.
@stevebannon69 Did u know that the 1.4mill illegals in Texas alone, contributed 20b in state taxes? And that was in 2006...
Still under Obama. Fiscal year not finished....
Yeah, we knew the world would become a better place.
Chump's research team at work. #watchmepullarabbitoutofmyhat
thanks obama!
Thank You President Obama!  A real Potus, not a fraud POSPOTUS!
You are a joke.
you're still riding wave of all of Obama's work. Wait till October, that's when your results come in. Get a clue already.
Also Hate crime has risen twice all Thanks to you. You'd made America Feared again.
my stocks go up ever day because of you obama don't no stock market you are a real man the south love  you
your grammatically and politically incorrect. Your ignorance is unpatriotic!
Thank you once again @POTUS44
your approval rating of 37% is an all-time low. Get a grip on reality 45.
Businesses are excited to have a real man at the helm who understands money, instead of constant moral posturing like obama
Thanks to you!  Makes us angry when Obama tries to take credit for it!  He is an evil loser.  He thinks he still rules all.
are you claiming responsibility for all of this? You were handed an economy on solid footing...don't screw it up like AC!!!
no jobs yet, just more $ for Wall Street
that has done jack shit for me.
you can't take credit for that loser
Stock increases make the rich, richer. They do not create jobs.
YOU HAVE CREATED NO JOBS? YOUR RIDING OBAMAS COAT TALES DUH !!!!!

There was only one person who could do this and that's why we voted for you.
Once again falsely taking credit where it's not due. This is a constant character fault   akin to your constant lying.
via shortsighted & non-sustainable policies..we'll be dead before the repercussions, but our grandkids won't. Thanks a lot.
all due to things YOU had no control over. You did none of this. Obama did. You lie and claim victory that is not yours.
Thank you so much.  My IRA has grown by $8K since you took office.
I'm sure Steve Jobs is thanking you from beyond for recognizing his contribution
Thanks to OBAMA & team!
And still, your approval ratings are the worst ever at with a 52% disapproval for 1/30 - 2/5. You suck, resign!
So this also means you will take the blame when the market crashes? Nah... didn't think so.
so which of your financial plans was applied oh that's right Obama apply those
yes right it's put money in your pocket it hasn't created jobs.   That's total crap.
Where are the jobs?
President Trump, Can you please get something done asap, on the Miners Insurance & Pension? Very Serious....

-The gains in the Market are paper only, nothing in Trumps plans suggest they will be anything but temporary.
Yeah, wish I knew what to invest in to make some of that money!!!!
Russia
awesome
.@realDonaldTrump -Let's see where Stk Mkt goes W/O DELIVERY of big tax cuts, drunken sailor spending, excess de-reg, neo-ACA, & trade wars!
Sad!
Tired of winning, the US economy has slowed dramatically under Trump. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/28/the-economy-grew-0-7-percent-in-trumps-first-quarter-federal-data-show/?utm_term=.4e7dff9c45ca …
stop taking credit for things in motion well before you ran for office. This is the longest running bull market in history
Those numbers have NOTHING to do with you.
u haven't done anything about jobs yet. You saved like 700 jobs & passed 2 bills letting oil take bribes & coal 2 pollute
still under Obama budget and policies. Not yours! Stop taking credit!!
Thanks to Obama
. Mr President. My name Michael D Landingham. Chairman of All Lives United Movement. This is a movement to be a family.
Yeah - Was already record highs with Obama. When the market correction comes will you take credit too? its overdue now
that's not because of you. You'd know this if you knew anything about how it all works.
Stores are still closing,destroying the clean air act will hurt fishing industry & cuts to vital programs is loss of jobs!
Thanks @BarackObama !
The Government could save more money if the stop re-electing the senators that only had been there collecting a pay check
BTW tell junior to shut up if you are going to say you have no money tie to Russia
thank u , for the update , keep up the great work .. 
keep up the fight  Mr. President 
many conservative market analysts are discussing over valuation. Will you brag when the correction ultimately occurs?
keep up the AMAZING JOB MR. PRESIDENT! #bestPOTUS #LOVEtrump
The healthy state of the economy is hardly the product of tthe6 weeks of bumbling and divisiveness by your administration.
#thanksobama

Thanks to President Obama's great run.  Please look at the FACTS as to how long the Dow has been doing absolutely great.
Take credit for work you don't do, yet hide or blame when crap goes wrong. Makes me proud! NOT!!
@TeamTrump dems trying to distract from your job. Don't let them. Dems distracting from your job. Please don't fail us.
Wait for it... Wait for it... *POP*
My biggest fear is that Wall Street has once again manipulated the markets for you. I hope it's not held up by your hot air
Not because of you 
Yes! But, fortunately it has little to do with you. Oh sad, sad lying man.
The Investment Class loves you and all your billionaires
