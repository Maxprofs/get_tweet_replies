.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews It actually shows you paid taxes...why on Earth would you say fake news?
do you just enjoy saying fake news? This shows how idiotic you are. You should be embracing this.
you should be saying "SEE I PAY TAXES!"
But all this did is leave us questions as to why you won't release your tax returns. What are you hiding?
probably hiding how much money he spent in Russia to get peed on by prostitutes
That's a lot of rubles!
Not as much as you'd think lol
You planted those tax returns. Why else would it say "client copy"?
You are an embarrassment. Stop tweeting. You're bad at it. #TrumpRussia
And yours, too. #TrumpRussia #Trumpcare #TheResistance #wednesdaywisdom
Guess who is hit hardest by #Trumpcare?
That's right!

YES! Look at us using those "SCARE QUOTES", it's almost like we didn't really mean it! Just like Spicer said: SOMETIMES WE'RE JOKING!
And look HOW FAST we responded to that FAKE NEWS thing! Even though we're still UNDER AUDIT!
WHY? Because nobody really cares about those STUPID TAXES! We have an OBLIGATION to pay as LITTLE taxes as possible!
Besides, we're REALLY BUSY dealing with much more IMPORTANT things like our SECRET plan to defeat ISIS in 30 DAYS!
And BY THE WAY, you can totally hold us accountable for that! The 30 DAYS just haven't STARTED yet!
And then there's that thing where we are giving MILLIONS of people the FREEDOM to stop having HEALTHCARE!
LINCOLN was great for freeing the IMMIGRANTS with their DREAMS, but WE are even GREATER for freeing the POOR!
FREEDOM from healthcare! FREEDOM from other people's babies! FREEDOM from Muslims that are not from Saudi Arabia!
Oh honey from the architect of FAKE NEWS you should know anything is possible specially in that tiny mind or yours
even that reporter believes it was probably U! who leaked those 2005 tax forms showing the only time u ever! paid taxes
You're the master! of distractions sweetie, you live in a place called "Crazy town" where all your fictional news resides

I find that an insult to Orangutans worldwide
Haha, no. It's clear you 'leaked' them yourself to distract from your horrendous Healthcare Act & Russian ties.
It's convenient that, after refusing to release returns for years, suddenly two pages come to light and OH WOW they show you've paid tax...
Showing the world a 12-year old tax return is as worthless as your Healthcare Act: both offer zero clarity or benefit to Americans.
Anyone with a shred of common sense can see your tactic, 45. You need to show the last 10 years of returns. But that'll expose you! SAD!
Here's @CNN sharing facts on the reporter Trump claims "nobody ever heard of".
another reliable information source cnn,really?
I'm sorry, what is it your questioning about the above report? It includes 100% facts 
OK, princess, here we go again. Grab a box of juice and settle down as I explain this to you.
the document that was in the mailbox was a photocopy of YOUR version of the document. The leak was on YOUR end.
the only thing that is fake here is your $4.99 spray on tan from Walgreens. The filing is real, THUS, no fake.
Journalists don't get fired for reporting on your copy of YOUR tax filing, they get fired for not reporting on it.
As you yourself said recently about the democrats security flaws, your security is lax and needs to be addressed.
if we can't trust you with your own documentation, how can we trust you with state secrets? Get your act together
Rumour is that it's a distraction for the Comey announcement today/tomorrow about him possibly being investigated for the Russia thing
and healthcare 
stranger things have happened 
the real question: did you leak these two pages to relieve the overwhelming pressure to release your tax returns
turned out to be positive news which is good, so why not release them like every other president since Nixon?
Thank him for doing what everyone else does?  Nope.
No idea what you're trying to express. Thx for weighing in, though.
.@realDonaldTrump @oppstn He won a Pulitzer, people have heard of him.
And if they're fake news why did the White House release a statement with the same data as the returns he had?
I think he's still working out the details of where he's headed with this....
Health care! Obama! Walls! Ice! Someone help me!
I still think he believes twitter is his diary.
And then he's angry and confused when we all know what he's been thinking. Musta been tapp'd.
Exactly!
Please stop lying. (1) A real document is not #fakenews (2) Don't pretend ignorance: you know Cay's a Pulitzer Prize winner
You also know @DavidCayJ tells the truth about your "lifelong embrace of mobsters, violent felons [and] Russian oligarchs."
It's dumb to lie about a guy who has written about you for 30 years. A smarter liar would have claimed you made him famous!
.@jackschofield @realDonaldTrump  A smart man wouldn't lie as badly as Trump, but there is this: "Prisons are filled with bad liars." 
Alas, bad liars can avoid prison if they are very rich and can buy people off, settle out of court, or sue...
.@jackschofield @realDonaldTrump Maybe Trump's day is coming? Never has he been under such intense dogged scrutiny, and it's just begun.
Even @FoxNews reports on his declining popularity. The hate must get to his ego eventually...
.@jackschofield @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews  Hence return to crazy ego driven campaign like rallies. He craves adulation; less of it there.
Saudis don't believe restriction on travel from 6 mostly Sunni nations is targeting Islam
"President Trump expressed his deep respect for the Religion of Islam"
the majority of 911 Terrorists including Osama came from SA why pick on 7 other countries?
thank you for pointing that out. Seems like people are forgetting that.
We will never forget.
You do realize you already acknowledged the tax returns were real in a statement last night, right? @realDonaldTrump https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/841966077005463553 …
That is the problem with lies, so hard to keep up with them.
Pray for @realDonaldTrump #DrainTheSwamp
He probably got it through your microwave.
He got it from Trump's WH. This is 100% their own leak. Look how they're playing it.
It's the classic double-reverse.
is that what you call the feat of mental gymnastics to keep the lie going?
paperwork from that long ago could have been stolen by dozens of people.
It says right on it "Client Copy". Somebody close to him or himself leaked it.
.@realDonaldTrump well someone's heard of him...
Pulitzer hall is basically the original fake news room.
ohhh I get it now, it's the "fakenews awards"
fake and yet confirmed by the White House...I get it...right
yes. Your White House staff confirmed it before it even aired.
...you dummy.
the news is just as fake as Your toupee 
 

EDIT: 325,000 streams now.
regardless if it was $1MIL or $1, I got fans. 
Grow up. You're a loser and you know it.
he has fans and you don't. Put the salt back in the spice cabinet.
you leaked it to distract from Russia.
you mean the same Russia that Hillary and her campaign and dealings with?

your hypocrisy is showing.

classic lib, pretending to fight with a meme, Hilary, Russia, Uranium.

.@realDonaldTrump What's amazing here is president has never heard of @DavidCayJ, Pulitizer Prize winner, New York Times bestselling author.
Under normal circumstances, amazing. For the intellectually incurious Trump, not so.
Trump obviously knows him, this is one of his stupider lies.
.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews he wrote a book about you, which we all know you obsessed over. Try harder to express 'fake' outrage
He's not an actor. He's a 2nd rate entertainment monkey. You're asking too much of your president.
Yes because you leaked it. Now we come for 2008-2015. you see, it's backfired on you... #Trumprussia #TrumpTaxes

Very clear Pres leaked tax returns & is pretending he's mad about it. But why? Chaos is how he gained power & how he'll keep it. Simple.
.@realDonaldTrump Yes. I believe it, especially as they make you look good. But I don't get why you chose to leak it to @NBCNews.
And you know he did how?
Because if someone in the media made it up it wouldn't be done to make Trump look good.
he leaked it to Johnson, an investigative reporter who wrote a bio of him. Johnson took to Maddow
.@realDonaldTrump My guess is that you are well aware of who this reporter is, since he wrote a book about you. https://www.amazon.com/Making-Donald-Trump-David-Johnston/dp/1612196322 …
If Trump released these, what is to say they are legitimate - quick to confirm Trump has forged docs before
Does anyone really believe @realDonaldTrump, a serial liar, didnt leak his 2005 1040 return himself b/c #TrumpCare is imploding?
#TrumpTaxes
He's also trying 2 distract from his traitorous ties to Russia. #TrumpRussia #PutinsPuppet #TheResistance
.@realDonaldTrump can try to distract all he wants; but we want to see his tax returns! Donald Trump is #FakeNews
Remember when you thought China was in the TPP and Rand Paul made you look stupid? It’s happening again with this tweet.
fake news is tirrrreeed u need a new thing to harp on about during your interlocking scandals
Does anybody believe an old failed businessman won an election without help from the Russians...NO
.@realDonaldTrump has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating. Why so high? http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx …
@maddow Trump & Pence approval rating is higher than #CorruptDNC #CorruptMedia .
#veryfakenews
Last time I checked, the DNC isn't an elected official.
#DemocratParty
.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews
you planted them there as a distraction so you could bait them. One theory.
does anyone really believe an idiot like you would make America great again? As if we weren't already the greatest 
you mean like Clinton?
You and Bannon's disinformation campaigns aren't even good anymore. This was so obviously your own leak.... 
lol I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd say one of their best in terms on entertainment value for supporters.
As long as you recognize it for what it is I suppose.
his tax returns are none of your business. And he is as real of a POTUS as any of the 44 before him. You lose.
even compared to some of your shenanigans, that is utterly ridiculous sir!
SIR...? I'm sorry . . he doesn't deserve that title... Mr Trump will be fine..

FAKE NEWS? You confirmed the validity of the tax return. How could this possible be fake?
The 2005 tax returns of @realDonaldTrump may have been sent to @DavidCayJ by #Trump or his designee. We need full returns.
yes.
1. @realDonaldTrump posing with 2015 tax return. 

2. Sum total of tax returns now in public domain.
.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews    Yup, sure seems like ur the likely leaker (Russian hooker pun intended). #trump
no. I believe you mailed them - considering they say client copy.
Sure! Crazier things have happened... like your presidency!
aka @potus & @NBCNews - pretty sure we know what happened.
would be funny though.  Lol. Mail does get mixed up.  But haven't heard this one. FAKE NEWS
What if it is a "fake leak", the other years being much worse? Releasing them all is the presidential thing to do.
That reporter "nobody ever heard of" is a @PulitzerPrize winner, Mr. President.
cc: @DavidCayJ
No. FAKE NEWS was your tweet about Obama releasing122 detainees who are fighting again. AND YOU NEVER CORRECTED THE NUMBER.
same people who believe obama was hiding in your microwave
I believe in the reality of that over you as President. If there's no news, why hide it? Release your tax returns.
We believe: You are a liar. You said would release taxes. Lie. Lower insurance cost. Lie. For Middle Class. Lie.
You are serving only those with more money than the middle class. You threw us under the bus with old people.
If only there was an 18 month campaign where you could’ve seen that coming
Ah yes, that "nobody" reporter who won a Pulitzer for reporting on the exact tax issues he reported on re: @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews
they are just jealous of you Mr. President. I voted for you &honored you're my President ♡
No one in his/her right mind would be jealous of such a national embarrassment!!
nope. Neither do most people the utter shite you talk pal
Ben who are you? Are you friend or foe? Be careful which path you take.
what are you talking about?!
You are nasty to a person who only wants the best for you. You can't be nice to everyone
how does he want the best for me? Lowering regulations on coal companies, Wall Street, denying climate change
climate change happens regardless of human interaction
are you that stupid? human interaction like fossil fuels? we created this. embarrassing you hold that view
will you punish the reporter？
.@realDonaldTrump @PressSec Enuf already. Just cut the shit. Ur verbal wrestling, duplicity & 24/7 lying's an insult 2 American ppl. #trump
You said it
@ramburner1 @NBCNews Start by Locking that reporter up and seeing where that leads
Nope, I believe you, yourself, leaked those tax returns, #Trump  Now, release your most recent, per ur promise
@k4artever @NBCNews

The Ravenous Bug Blatter Beast, is so stupid it thinks that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you.

@NBCNews
Trumptanic is wearing Joo Jantas too! Unfortunately for him they are black all the time!So he makes it up
BUT THEY ARE LOOKING COOL AND STYLISH WEARING THEM!!!

@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews
I grew up on the first HHGTTG radio programme and TV  show on BBC! Know it by heart.. it's on YouTube

*I PERSONALLY THINK YOU NEED TO SUE THEM. SHOW THE WORLD THAT THEY SHOULD NOT MESS WITH U= A NEW SHERIFF N TOWN!!
. David Cay Johnston is a well known reporter who does not lie, unlike Trump, Liar in Chief
Donald, maybe you should listen to your wife and stop the online bullying. It's not presidential. It's childish.
news net works are fake news. Part of the shadow government you dopes
Fake So-Called Orange President what? #TheResistance #NotMyPresident #whineylittlebitch
@dasertine @NBCNews  SO FAKE , they can't even come up with a good lie

Fake News rules MSNBC  news
and King Obama is still in Washington
Mr President keep tweeting the fake news and the snowflakes can't change your words and that really upsets them..
only when ur own WH confirms do they oh & when u say it didn't happen as we know that u only tell lies Fake denial
You set the standard in Fake News.  Almost everything you say is fake, made up, or lies.
NO you sent it to them. Russia is controlling you.
his mailbox is directly connected to your microwave Trumpanzee
I believe we the taxpayers, have a bunch of criminals in the white house, and the president is the leader.

Grade 3 page 2, get your act together!  Loser.
@popsfisherhl that's only to cover up the criminal act of stealing your tax info and releasing it to the public.
Ummmm, you love anonymous sources and leaks. You've said it yourself. 

Prove it's fake and show the real one. Simple!
,NBC is a group of loosers,low life's =very crooked fake news
We all know you're a liar and probably will never share your taxes with Americans. Bad (or sick).
I pray its not "Fake News" Trump & Cruz Pres. Campaigns were Obama bugged, or Obama is owed a huge apology @greta
.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews yes we believe it because you had it put there. You are the leak, Tiny Hands McGee.
Yes, we do. Also believe you leaked good year to make US believe you pay taxes and as a distraction. #resist

What I don't believe is that this assclown hasn't been run out of office already. #dontforgetrussia #25thAmendment
Yes #LyingDonald - many believe exactly that ... completely reasonable that a source would send @DavidCayJ your #TaxReturn
yea, considering you probably leaked the only decent taxes you've ever had it's totally possible.
@MexicoRS78 @NBCNews However he got them they must have been stolen. In UK would be arrested for receiving stolen property.

Unfortunately, you're the POTUS, so, yeah, I can believe it.
