Any thoughts on climate change now?
SORRY...read the Constitution..
Impeachment not gonna happen.
I have a better idea... move to a country with a president you like better.
I find it funny how people 2 move bc of their opinion just bc it doesn't align w theirs.
EXCUSE ME. I find negative, ugly, UNPROVOKED comments from Trolls HIGHLY insulting.
SOMETIMES I respond.
If you don't like those comments, maybe move to a different country.
I'd rather stay here and fight for my own country while pissing off cult45
This guy is just brilliant. Calming and authoritative. What a great spokesman. A true leader.
He denies climate change is real, how is that brilliant???
No matter what he denies, in a crisis he is looking like a steady hand. That's what matters.
Good Job! WELL DONE
I live in Ohio and I am truly  frightened for the people in Florida. Prayers.
Thank you!
I live in Tampa.
We must evacuate-  no choice- Storm Surge.

Even amid #irma he'll probably say #climatechange is not real on behalf of his Koch funders
It's obvious climate change is not real. Nothing more then a scare to make the people more dependent on the government
No, the government is clearly not helping against climate issues
Go back to your country and get them in compliance or at least to what the USA has already done!

The governor that didn't take calls from the nursing home that let 8 people die! Someone will pay dearly. They would if it was my parent!
He did a better job than Abbott in Texas who left if up to the mayor of each town and stiffed sending the USNG until Houston was afloat

God Bless You Governor Scott.  You are THE MAN!  and doing a great job.
Florida is so Blessed to have such a man !

Florida Governor Rick @FLGovScott. #HurricaineIrma 
You need to help the people that live in Naples FL. They have no water and no one has gone to help.
Fake New is at it again! The state hasn't even gotten the cash yet and GovScott is being acused of imbeseling the relief cash! It won't work
Good job
Ricky couldn't kiss your ass more than he did during the hurricane. All news conf had lots of praise & lip smacking. You 2 make me sick.
RT @Scavino45: Florida Governor Rick @FLGovScott. #HurricaineIrma ...
Great MAN
Our governor is just as crooked and slimmy as you are! #Slimmybag
Go! realDonald #Trump. Play golf while the others swim!
Do you remember #climatechange And Global Warming?
No such thing. Normal cycles of the earth.
Humm....very normal..... They don't seem....
Trump should resign
And why should he resign? He didn't make this hurricane.
This guy was the CEO of the company that got the largest medicare fraud fine in history. So Floridians elected him governor. Bwahahahahaha
Hey donny, isn't @FLGovScott another of your guys who denies #ClimateChange ?

I guess you'll all be 'praying' again today ?

Hows that denial of climate change working out for you? FLA will start to be fully submerged underwater in 10 years.
This is a huge wake up call for this idiot to finally come to terms with the impact and danger of Climate Change. Its real and its happening
Gove could have helped his state by not denied #ClimateChangeIsReal for years, ignored FACTS, hurt constituents

Oh @BarackObama! We really need you! Bet you'll be in the thick of #hurricaneimra cleanup, and not 45, because he thinks it's beneath him!
Gov. Rick Scott, the dirty politician who BANNED all mention of #climatechange by #Florida state employees and government officials.

Superb leadership!!  Thank you Govenor Scott!!  Florida STRONG!!
Thank God you had  governor such as this man. God bless you all for all you had done and for what you have to do.
Dan are you positively sure that's actually the governor?  Just saying, it's always good to double check.

What about those working at gas stations? They have to be saved, too!
Here is VOLDEMORT in the flesh.  Why elect him to govern you?  YOu CAN do better---and should.

DAY ONE N TWO THIS GUY PRAISED TRUMP B4 THE STORM HIT.  REMINDS US OF THE MEETING WHERE ALL THE REP. PRAISED TRUMP ABOUT HOW GREAT HE WAS.

It will cost over 300 Billion to rebuild after Hurricanes HARVEY and IRMA. Oh Well!!! ........... I guess that's the end of "Trump's Wall"
Can't believe some people are bringing up Climate Change at a time like this. Would they bring up traffic safety because of car crashes?
.@FLGovScott you don't care about Fla.  Just like the #FakePresident you only care about your $$$! #VoteThemOut #Impeach
Is it so hard to say Good Job about someone you don't agree with politically? Not really. See, I just did it. Good Job Gov. Scott.
The guy who stole billions from Medicare, right?  Yeah, that's Rick Scott.
Trump...isn't CBS fake news???
Look at Skeletor with his Navy hat on !!
Potato

Is Rick Scott still prohibiting the use of the term "climate change" in FLA state govt?  Do you think God is trying to tell you something?
NICE JOB YOU ARE DOING GOVERNOR !!!
God Bless governor Rick for wonderful job during this trying time.
But my area was not under evac orders. And projections showed it going up the east coast. We are glad we didn't go west but staying home
Trump is the psychopath that nobody dared to protest against! But, the globe dared! http://independent.co.uk/environment/ea … #TrumpResign #psychopath
Organization of the Federal, State and local agencies was the best ever. Thanks to President Trump and Governor Scott, lives were saved.
Maybe open up Winter WH
During Sandy, Ocean County NJ refused to stop foreclosure sales. We lost everything we owned. Put a stop to sheriff sales during disasters

That may not really be @FLGovScott or Irma @Scavino45 has a hard time keeping shit straight.
So proud of GOV SCOTT.

Fucking CBS telling them to make him stop talking so they can go onto the next 'segment' You can tell at the end.
Gov Scott a great American Patriot!!
Arrest the looting thugs 
Yeah, make them put all those Asian made goods back. Thank you American security force protecting Chinese profits and jobs. 
#Uaidiot
Well done to Rick Scott!  Tremendous service to Florida and it's people 
why are the police not arresting or shooting the looters?
looks like the #Nazi whose #HCA ruthlessly reduced safety for patients n profits from drug testing cannot be a real governor #Profiteer
A running list of viral hoaxes about Irma - including one shared by the White House
God I pray that you calm down the storm. I maybe in Africa but we're with you in prayers
So what’s the excuse for Miami bring in the dark tonight when the storm landed in the West? Typical American incompetence? Complacency?
@realDonaldTrump @VP @POTUS Climate Change is real.  How can you address it, if you can't even say it  Regulations (Building codes) matter

Proud and Loud to say we have a smart hard working Governor in Rick Scott. Thank you Governor for helping us endure Irma.
Yes, since he's helping to cause it by being a climate change denier. All that means is he values businesses over citizens.
The reason or 1 reason some try to stay through these storms is the coverage of The Weather Channel reporters standing out in the storm !
Rick Scott been great to Florida with this storm! Thank you @FLGovScott!  Florida strong
