Big Busn LOVEs Pres Trump u are doing things that are so common sense that predecessors highly devoid of to the POTUS!
Donald Trump has his mind up his rear end. He is close to death age so he does not care if North Korea or any other country blows up USA. I do not believe he cares about the people of USA who works their butts off to make 25,000 a year.
Ypu left out "and got himself a huge check in the process.
old news. Jobs came in 2013
he's up fuck all. He's inherited a vibrant economy.
WHAT SACRIFICE!! He and his cronies are getting even richer and his supporters are waiting!!! Dream on!
he has already made more money than he could ever spend, why would he need to make more
there are those who base their personal life accomplishments on wealth/power. NEVER ENOUGH!

That was started under Obama!





Kislyak has literally met every single person in the senate, he's an ambassador. That's his job

Sad!
.@realDonaldTrump You are no longer credible, just a crazy conspiracy theorist. You have destabilized USA with your words & deeds. SAD
do you hear a click when you pick up the phone?
Exxon mobile needs to retire. I voted for you. You said #NEWTECHNOLOGY Did you fool us, too. Unite us, retire oil. 
#NoDAPL
@Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump The White House is literally copy and pasting from Exxon.
President Trump talks about himself in the third person like some kind of lunatic.
Trump talks like a luatic.
Because he IS a lunatic.

#TaxReturns
--- wait didn't you say you wanna STOP lobbyism ?! 
true
Still no word re: your relationship to Russia? It's not going away.
Still no word? Thought you trusted Intelligence?
Clapper again said - No ties found....
Liberals 
are you referring to yourself in the 3rd person?
next he uses the royal we.
"We are not amused"
.@realDonaldTrump Jobs created and an environment destroyed.  Thanks for caring about our children!
Americans decry yet another example of corporate welfare.
'President Trump Congratulates Exxon Mobil for Job-Creating Investment Program'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/president-trump-congratulates-exxon-mobil-job-creating-investment …...
AND DESTROYING THE ATMOSPHERE...YAY, EXXON!
Practice what you preach.. 
Trump's vineyard is hiring -- foreign workers
tired of hearing of about changing of words to make it fit say what they mean & mean what they say!
Sounds exactly like a headline from North Korea #kcna #lol #trump
You should resign here and now. Such a clown in US history of presidents!
You have no honor. I hold no respect for people like you. @realDonaldTrump loves this country and has its support. Keep dishonor to yourself
#MuslimBan
Had to change it to seconds, and also had to change it to "international" after many of our friends around the world asked.
You really blamed Obama for "wire tapping"? REALLY? I don't think Obama would say this, but his anger translator might.
The most corrupt #POUTUS (Yes, #poutUS) we've ever had. #TheResistance
REALLY!   Obama was so much more corrupt than trump ever thought of
.@profbill76 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump by "corrupt" we assume you meant "black"
dude, that's literally the egg's ONLY tweet. lmao
Hang on @realDonaldTrump while I let that sink in
Urine over your head. Peeotus doesn't appreciate your potty humor.
Erm.... @rsrchmnky @realDonaldTrump it's a SINK you douche.  
Yeah, but @rsrchmnky probably shits in his sink.
Hah! @CityJohn @rsrchmnky That's an excrement point  
On closer inspection, I think @rsrchmnky might be agreeing with you.
oh shit ha
then I hereby apologies.... but I won't delete it..... as I deserve to be the douche. (I don't shit in the sink tho) 
what about General Motors is laying off 1,100 workers in Michigan -- the fourth layoff it's announced since you got elected
investment? You mean pay to play. #fakenews
You do realize that this is a small capital program for a large oil company.
Yea, yea, yea just keep those #RussianSanctions in place blocking access to those 500 million acres Exxon has in Russia.
Why do you constantly tweet your own horn? A majority of Americans don't give a hoot.
from WH statement "Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue" started 4 yrs ago why does trump get credit?
yup taking credit for this too?
Another conspiracy theory??
so sad the state this country has become
who the fuck is this president trump guy???
most of this was in the works with Obama.  You are a fraud.
You mean the billionaires you added to the swamp will line their pockets with the deals you make? What a fucking surprise. Who'da thunk it!
#GrabYourWallet Boycott @exxonmobil Renewable energy is he future
started in2013 what's it to do with you ?
more like Congratulations to Rex Tillerson, he is the  (ExxonMobil)beneficiary. You're just the puppet.
it's Tillerson's former company and you claim credit?  That's the best u can do?  Seriously?   What a joke
. Which has nothing to do with you.
"President Trump Congratulates Exxon Mobil for plans that have been in the works for years, thereby appearing to take credit for this."
Finally a "real" American President! Yours truly Rick Huston.
Oh God. No conflict there with Tillerson, huh? You're swimming in payola. Congress get on the investigation! @SenWarren
lock them up!
why do u keep taking credit for something u didn't do? And blaming everyone but yourself?
why do you hate America so much you bring oil pipe line to our rivers and oil refineries to the coast
Until you have proof about Putin, move on to something else, like, the things @realDonaldTrump is doing for our country,
JOKE!
hopefully these guys keep their words..
so insecure about your win you have to speak in first person
Exon Chemical can stay out of Florida thank you very much
Did you just refer to yourself in the third person?
Thank you !!!
Exxon-Mobil--Secretary of State Tillersons company? SAD, don't even try to hide cronyism. Corruption-BAD swamp city.

what's the investment to counter the health effects this will have on citizens and natural environment? #mychildrenswimhere
LIAR
and you are claiming this is solely because of your greatness. You are a weak embarrassment.
So you're compartmentalising your twitter profiles...
Stop deflecting from your Russia problems - Feds closing in!
is this why Tillerson is Secretary of State?
way to go! Pad the pockets of oil industry and let future generations bare the cost. Global warming poses a greater threat!
you know you are desperate when you write your own headlines! Donnie, how about we talk about  Russia?
we love you President Trump and,we are praying gor you!
Glad u r like teflon! Hateful comments would bother some folks. Keep your eye on the ball & know the majority is with you
when it is all said and done, you are a compete failure at your job.
uhhh...sorry to tell you this but Exxons plan started in 2013 under Obama #Jackhole
at what cost don.  Who did you have to make a deal with. What are your billionaires buddy going to get why everyone else 
Release your tax returns.
.Way to go!
Thank you! Now drain the swamp!
You have to resist the urge to tweet about anything that does not relate to policy.
I worked for Exxonmobil for 25 years, it was a great place to work and retire from!!
strong commitment from exxon, good job sir, you great . 
Thank you President Trump for bringing jobs back to this county and putting America & Americans first.
