Ok so trump serving his presidency, WITHOUT salary, is theft. But Obama’s $1.7 billion dollar Iran deal or an 18 month witch hunt about Russia, that didn’t turn up anything, are a perfect use of tax payers money? Did I ge that right?
To be clear....he does TAKE his salary and THEN donates it to the gov as tax write off. Let's see his tax returns. He is a repulsive.
But what’s so wrong for doing so? It’s rightfully so he can write it off on his taxes because the money is donated to a charity and not in his bank account? The real question is why wouldn’t you write it off on your taxes? Why get taxed on money you don’t have?
Nothing President Trump does will ever please the Resist group! The have been told to Resist Resist Resist no matter what! We could have done the same to Obama but that’s the difference between the  right and left ! Respect!!
Are you insane. Do you not remember the GOP obstructionists? They would not allow Obama to get anything to pass. They also held up his Supreme Court nominee for almost a yr as if there was no vacancy. Repubs have been so partisan it is sick. It is party b4 country for GOP.

SENATOR TESTER IS A LIAR AND NEEDS TO BE RUN OUT OF THE SENATE!!!!
He just showed you exactly how much the Democrats give a damn about veterans… Which is not one bit! The Democrat party has spit in the face of veterans at every single chance it’s got. They’re letting the VA crumble by not letting someone be put in place to head it!
I am the great granddaughter of a vet, the granddaughter of a vet, niece of vets, DAUGHTER of WW2 vet, sister of 2 Nam vets, and the mother of an AF vet. My brother DIED in a VA hospital in 2016. Their care for him was EXCELLENT. BTW, all of the listed? DEMOCRATS. STOP LYING.
"Very dishonest and sick!"?
OK well there's no need to add anything further.
The Democrats are all liars


Can't wait for the rally tonight!!!
"Imma let you finish, but Donald Trump had one of the best Nobel Prize worthy performances of all time!"
The Noble @BarackObama, and the Fool @kanyewest
Obama did nothing for 8 years.

This motherfucker just won't stop tweeting.
You are sounding more crazy everyday. Our president is supposed to be a person of honor. Your just a shithole.
The only horrible thing we in DC have to live with is your fat ass, and WMATA.
these people should be held accountable for their lies
You are right. No collusion. I think the more accurate description of what you did is conspiracy. Conspiracy to commit treason against the United States of America.
Fact is that the Republican Veterans committee chair, Sen. Isakson, fully supported what Tester did. Why are you not calling him out?
Birther dude says what @realDonaldTrump?
Secret Service? Or Fox 'news'??
Fact Checker:  President Trump has made 2,436 false or misleading claims so far
Guess Hillary still has him beat by at least 33,000 lies...
Well said, Brian. Funny how the Left all of sudden became focused on “lies” when they were no longer in power. The Left isn’t interested in truth - they’re just trying to take down an elected President any way they can. For them, it’s about power & not about making America great
Well said? It's funny how every time some one speaks poorly of Trump, Trumpers immediately cite Hillary. AntiTrump does not equate ProHillary. Time for a new shtick.
Well, then get over it, Lesley. If the Left would stop with all the whining and obstructionist tactics, we could move on as a nation.
It's amazing how well the minority is obstructing the majority. Especially on simple majority votes.
And now you deny the Left has called themselves “the Resistance”? Are you admitting defeat because you are so bad at resisting?

If all the allegations are untrue why didn’t you stand by your nominee?
You raped your wife.  She said so.  #Roseanne
DRAIN THE DEEP STATE
Oh dear
Take him down, POTUS.

Based on a fake dossier bought and paid for by the DNC and Clinton foundation.
I wonder why all the indictments of Trump associates if it is all fake?  Let’s not forget about poor Cohen pleading the 5th. Innocent people don’t usually plead the 5th.
You had better look up who plead the 5th in the Obama administration. You are right. Innocent people usually do not plead the 5th. 
Quick news flash. Obama isn’t in office and whoever pleaded the 5th in his administration looked just as guilty. However, I don’t think it was Obama’s long time personal attorney we were talking about either.
Lois Lerner who pled the Fifth Amendment twice over allegations that the IRS had “targeted conservative nonprofit groups for additional scrutiny of their applications for tax-exempt status.”
In April 2012, General Services Administration (GSA)’s Jeffrey Neely invoked his Fifth Amendment right when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee called Neely to testify about improper spending.
Neely also invoked his Fifth Amendment right after photos emerged of Neely sitting in a bathtub with wine at GSA’s Western Regions Conference in 2010 in Las Vegas, which spent $822,000 in taxpayer money.
Just ask Tester about what type of meat he likes to eat!! #HumanTrafficking  #cannibalism
Hmmm
Oh my.... check this out @kbk3n3
Where are my manners.    Here is the link

Hahahaha!!
This is why Deep Fake is bad.
Show us the Secret Service report.  No offense, but nobody believes you!
GOOD   LUCK  MR    TRUMP  

LOVE  MAX
So par for the course. Thank you POTUS.
Really? Because that's not what the Secret Service has said publicly--that they have no information either way about any of the allegations (which aren't Tester's, either, but were made by witnesses to Senate investigators).
Gee, to think you know more than the Potus!
You must be special
I'm confident in my ability to read the document, yes.
Many such cases! Keep calling out Fake News, Mr. President! #MAGA
Still waiting for your finding on Obama's birth certificate.
Just look up Obama telling a group he was not a citizen and how he lied and became President. He is telling on himself on Video. Go look it up!!!! He don’t think this will back fire on him but,” wrong.”
You should properly vet your “best“ people before throwing them to the wolves!
so back up your rhetoric and renominate Admiral Jackson then and we will see what happens at the hearings assuming Senate Republicans even hold them.
Somebody said something untrue? Imagine that! 
finally a #POTUS who tells the people what they're afraid of 'the truth'
You do realize that repeating yourself is a sign of dementia.
I think we've already heard this today!

Oh please just stop the LIES! Over and over. Every single day. Lie after LIE, after LIE!
Donald Trump you are the dishonest and sick one
You’re golfing with the Secret Service?
Day #461 of the hostage situation. Evil Captor sings the blues!
I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved
I've been put down, I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved
@jamesalandarby
Still your President. #MAGA
So why did he withdraw, just shows he has no interest or no guts to fight it out. Then again maybe he really didn’t want to be part of your team!!!!
The Secret Service just informed me that Hillary won the popular vote by a huge margin and that hardly anyone showed up for your inauguration. You’ll have to live with it. #ImpeachTrump #HillaryWon
The Obama police state continues
Any Dr. who gets up in front of the world to lie about your height, weight, and your physical and mental health,was either drunk, or promised a position he wanted from you. Either way, he's the worst person to help our Veterans...
Mr. President, we need to take our news media back. I feel we should pull their licenses to broadcast through the FCC. Maybe they will get the message.

No, November 2008!
Best thing ever was correction Nov 2016!
Yep,

Our side does not

Need cry rooms
Scream at the sky
Suppress or censor free speech
Support illegals over its own citizens
You simply followed a traitor. Good job Henry.
Bah bah bah, I am happy where I am at!

President Trump traitor, hardly!

He loves this country!
MAGA!

He has not given billions to number state sponsor of terror.
He did not trade one traitor for five terrorists!
He has not apologized to the world

He is cleaning up Obama mess!
You're delusional Henry 
It was THEIR money
Dump IS the traitor
He needs to resign and apologize to the world for being the King of the morons. 

He IS making a mess. A mess of democracy and a mess of our country. You're just to stupid to see it because you're one of his moron's
Lol,
Remember, when and if the light bulb goes off in that backwards ass head of yours:

Just imagine that I will be laughing my ass off!

Just like election night!
Peace!
Jackson never had a chance. Democrat slimeballs are killing our country.
Actually I don't think that is what they said, but more importantly Republican @SenatorIsakson and most Republicans on the Veterans Affairs committee joined with @SenatorTester in his statement. Dr. Ronny Jackson was severely unqualified and was not vetted properly. Your mistake!
And the fact that some felt Jackson was not qualified is why we needed a hearing and not a public humiliation (true or not who knows?)
It was MIKE PENCE'S DOCTOR that reported these issues about Ronny Jackson.
Pence's doctor alerted WH aides about Ronny Jackson concerns last fall https://cnn.it/2HEY0fe 
Only one issue.  And it was pretty weak.
You must try harder, crime Don.
that was rude
#Montana You know what to do Testerout
Sorry, we like our Senator. He works, unlike the joke you follow.
You know that Russian collusion is probably true when it's driving you crazy. Guilty people ALWAYS squirm! Maybe if you get on your knees and cry when your convicted, the judge will go easy on you. I HOPE THEY GIVE YOU A LIFE SENTENCE AS TINY'S ROOMMATE! #youwillhavesuchablast
Tester should be brought up before the ethics committee at the very least. If you're a politician is it okay to slander and libel someone. Thanks Mr President.
Well, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics quit his job because he wasn't allowed to audit the #Drumpf's Executive Branch.
most of you won't read this or care, but sometimes late at night, i like to dress up in an orange track suit and wear a green furry hat and sit in my mother's garden and pretend I'm a carrot.

President Trump you are awesome. However, in this case I disagree with you. Senator Tester has an understanding for veterans who originate from rural areas that people from the city do not understand. The lack of VA services/ job opportunity.
When recovering from PTSD/ war injuries, veterans need a proactive VA administration that will aggressively help them through the red tape. (I am a family member of a wounded war veteran, so I know firsthand the extra help they need.)
A wounded war veteran does not have the wherewithal to attack the mass of red tape that prevents them receiving adequate/exceptional service! They need doctors, etc. who will aggressively attack the red tape on their behalf.
A huge concern with privatizing the VA is that it will cause the war veterans to become a product . These men/women have laid down their lives for our country. They fought for us, now we need tofight for them!
However, rural areas are unprepared to receive them back to help them to recover from war. Very sparse health infrastructure, very little diverse job opportunity for someone with a disability. Sufficient health facilities hundreds of miles round-trip away.
In sparse areas of rural West/Midwest, medical travel can be prohibitively difficult. Full-day travel, plane trips, overnight in motels/ losing work time, expense of travel/ eating out. Causing hardship to families, or if the veteran is alone without family.
The best doctors do not choose to practice in rural areas. After the effort they spend on an education, they do not want to live in a “backward, hick rural town.” They go to big cities.
It can be very difficult to find good health care in rural areas, especially veterans who made it special care to deal with war injuries, or PTSD.o
Jon Tester lack of morality is the disease killing off the Democractic Party.
The current Democrat Party are lawless, soulless, morally bankrupt trash.  Case in point?  That vile human being that calls herself a comic at the WHPC dinner.  Her jokes on abortion were the red line for me.  I will be pulling that Rep lever at the ballot box from here on out.
Thanks

NEWS: In private, Pence's doctor raised alarms last fall within the WH over Ronny Jackson's conduct, including allegations of aggressive and intimidating behavior - and that he may have improperly disclosed Karen Pence's private patient info. Ooppss
Turns out it was VP Pence who  brought Adm Jackson's conduct to Trump's attention last month who ignored it.  It is Trump himself who put Jackson in the bad spotlight.
Montanans know BS when we hear it. You my friend are full of it. @SenatorTester stands integrity, honesty, and doing the right thing - even when it's hard and unpopular. You could learn from him
You screwed Dr Jackson by appointing him to a job he was not qualified for. I mean, gee, 239 pounds, come on. If he can't read a scale, what value is he to the VA ?  Privatization is important to YOU,  but at what cost?
Pence's doctor warned White House about Dr Jackson. Shame on this administration. Shame on #realDonaldTrump. When will we stop being afflicted with this joke administration?
Mrs Pence has complained about Dr. Jackson's unprofessional behavior, too. Are you going to threaten her?
When he said you could live to be 200, everyone knew he was NUTS!!  #crazyronniejackson #candyman
And 6'3" 239lb
Your point is?!
someone explain it to Rose 
Why does someone else have to explain anything?These nothing to be explained!!! That’s why!! Lol! And you laugh at me???
Do you honestly believe that Trump weighs 239 pounds and he is 6 foot 3?
I have no idea nor did I state that!
Keep your blinders on Seabiscuit..
Adm.Jackson should SUE Pork Chop, Tester, for slander.
Tester the Molester?
What's TRUE is that the Admiral has been ACCUSED of these things, and that they therefore need to be investigated.   Secret Service should actually talk to the accusers and investigate from there, that's how that's supposed to work
With the news about Pence’s wife and Jackson’s treatment, it now appears all US Veterans owe Tester a bit of gratitude in whatever delay he may have caused to nip this nomination in the bud.
Looks like @VP was in on the witch hunt too!
Hey Dotard, @VP Mike Pence's doctor alerted White House aides about Ronny Jackson concerns LAST FALL!! So who's lying? Pence and his doctor?
@maddow

"A lot of people" r saying that Tester's statements r true.  Some very good PI's I know (when they get back from Hawaii) are going to be looking into this for me.  Apparently they've already started working on this from HI and they're coming up w/ some very interesting stuff..
Why just attack Tester? What about Georgia's Republican Senator, Johnny Isakson? He's the chairman of veterans' affairs committee after all.
He signed off on original memo requesting background information, and has also voiced his approved of Tester's actions.
#Asking4aFriend
So, why is Ronny Jackson no longer your White House personal physician?
I lend as much credence to the allegations made by Tester, as I do the ones made by Stormy Daniels, as any intelligent person should do.  Unfortunately, there are some who will not be as discerning, and will believe the lies.
@IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump #MuellerIsComingForYou
Stop lying...you were warned about him...
Yep, almost as sick as claiming Ted Cruz’s father was involved in JFK assasination. What kind of sick person would say such a thing?
If testors comments were fake then why not put Admiral Jackson in office?
This is fake news. And BTW sir, secret service is not a judge or jury. Please stop spreading fake news to us.
. Can he be sued for defamation of character?  If not , that's too bad. Next time just pick the person you want, put them in and screw anyone that doesn't like it.
YOU ARE THE ONLY PHONEY THING IN THE WH. JACKSON LIED ON YOUR PHYSICAL REPORT WE ALL KNOW THIS.  YOUR THE ONLY DISHONEST THING IN THE WH
Dr Jackson was still eminently unqualified for the position, regardless.
Jon tester is a bum Sir
Oh, really! "Very dishonest and sick!"? Now, what would a billionaire from New York, who business bankrupted six times and who boasted about grabbing woman's private parts, know about the honesty and integrity of a 3rd generation Montana farmer and former school teacher? Nothing.
Very dishonest and sick - that pretty much sums up DJ Dump.
A false witness should suffer punishment equal to the attempted damage on the one he falsely spoke against.
YOU SCREWED UP ON DR JACKSON, TRUMP.
NEWS: In private, Pence's doctor raised alarms last fall within the WH over Ronny Jackson's conduct, including allegations of aggressive and intimidating behavior - and that he may have improperly disclosed Karen Pence's private patient info. My story: https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/30/politics/karen-pence-doctor-privacy-ronny-jackson/index.html …
Using the criteria you set out warranting a resignation, all I can say is “After you, Sir!”

Distracting from your not vetting Jackson? Lying AGAIN as only one of Tester's allegations are questionable, many are not. Tester was doing his job to protect veterans. I believe him over you!
@FoxNews @VP  Call it / express it in any style you wish ..... Corruption by anyone; esp. those working for the People, can't go unpunished with no prison time.  No wrist slaps,  No sending them home with a fat gov. pension. "Heads must roll." "Bust 'em." "Enforce the law." Votes
And this coming from the guy that proudly admits to lying to world leaders. Sad!.
Montana loves Jon Tester. Trump is a corrupt politician out to destroy patriotic Americans. Thank you , Jon, for protecting the Veterans’ Administration. Trump wants to privatize it. Disaster!!!!
Bring Dr Ronny back! He has nothing to be afraid of. PLEASE go after #JenniferPena! She has a vendetta against Dr Ronny full of jealousy! Make it right President Trump! Time to stand up to these anti America #ObamaHoldOvers
You needed to stand much more strongly for Jackson.
‘Former Republican senator Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam veteran who would go on to serve as secretary of defense, rejected the attacks on Tester, arguing there is “no one who cares more about veterans and looks out for their interests than my former colleague, Jon Tester.”’

Secret Service has just informed me that President Trumps statements on everything are not true.
A horrible thing that we in the U.S.A. must live with, just like Russian Collusion. Trump should lose race in 2020. Very dishonest and sick!

Fixed that for you.
Hope he resigns. Thanks so much POTUS for getting the word out on Tester. Despicable. #DRAIN the SWAMP
Wish you convince him to stay AND fire Pence's DOC for issuing FALSE statements against him - FIRE JENNIFER PENA NOW!!
Well, the @SecretService should certainly put out an official statement to that effect, along with some details of how they investigated these allegations from 20 members of the US military which were REPORTED by Senator Tester.

And stop whimpering.
You are very dishonest and sick. #drain the whitehouse

What? I couldn't hear you over the birtherism.
Really?  So the thirty or so witness statements never happed?  You’re delusional.
LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE
You’re lying again, Don. And you say that you know things about Tester that would make it so that he wouldn’t get elected again if you spilled the beans. Are you a teenage girl in 9th grade??? GROW UP!!!
You might want to ask Mike about Ronny:
EXCLUSIVE BREAKING: Mike Pence's physician alerted the White House about Ronny Jackson last fall, alleging that he may have violated privacy protections for Karen Pence https://cnn.it/2JImXCX  
Not fake: Russian Collusion 

Fake: your hair
He should be fired by the people of Montana.
Not true. It was MIKE PENCE'S DOCTOR that reported these issues about Ronny Jackson & you know it. It was given to Tester because no Republican would do the right thing.
Pence's doctor alerted WH aides about Ronny Jackson concerns last fall https://cnn.it/2HEY0fe 
Not nearly as dishonest and sick as you Donnie!
#stfu
MAGA NEWS: GET TRUMP Part 3 , the dirty details, how Hillary's campaign revived an old Russian Hack from 2015, one they had ignored for over seven months, but decided to employ as part of their new Trump Russia narrative in April 2016. Must read & RT MAGA
He isn’t in charge of VA so « mission accomplished «
Please do something productive for the country today beside tweeting!! Even twerkiing would be acceptable!!!
I love Trump!
What? Did you really think they were true, the source was a DEMOCRAT!
We all know you can't believe anything they say. Just ignore them and maybe they will go away.
Believe me, Tester is the worst of the worst.....used to live there. Loved beautiful Montana but he is just an attention-seeking dud; poor judgement all the way! As evidenced by his doofus statements now. SMH #MAGA #KAG


That's 239 pounds of pure BULLSHIT!
You need to renominate Jackson to head the VA!   He is an honorable man!
You're terrified of exposure Traitor!!
I would suggest a man in your position (collaborator with a foreign enemy state) should not threaten people. It seems curious that fat indulged, and cowardly weaklings threaten other people as if to project themselves as tough when all around him know of his cowardice.
Supporting You from Minnesota
Just like the attack on Gen. Flynn, the attack on Candidate Judge Moore & the attack on You.   VP Pence's physician Dr. Pena I read made up these lies and took them to Senate Democrats to smear Admiral Jackson.   Pena needs to be FIRED.  Jackson needs to be appointed head of VA.
Imagine that! Another Liar ! Seems that's what most Democrats are Great at,Lieing and bashing others while they themselves are the culprits that bring in crooked and fake people such as Hillary and Obama,just to name a couple!
"We found evidence of collusion in the abundant secret meetings & communications between Trump campaign officials & associates such as Manafort, Gates, Papadopoulos, Don Jr., Flynn & others, w/ emissaries & officials from, or linked to the Russian gov."

-Adam Schiff
With this endorsement I would absolutely vote for Tester.
Do you recall the Central Park 5?  Remember how you went after them? Remember how many times you lied? Extensive investigations, DNA and testimonies prove their innocence.  Yet YOU still don't believe it!  Talk about dishonest and sick!
I hope @USAGSessions investigates who “ forced” @SenatorTester to lie about Dr. Jackson! Probably same people profiting from VA corruption! #SES?  @GeorgWebb
Says the guy being sued for #defamation for calling women he paid off after #sex liars. Ok..
He is his own enemy. Lies has no back bone. Lord said to Moses , " Vengeance is mine. "
Pence’s doc warned u of Jackson. You now owe Liberals an apology, but would be too dysfunctional to do so.

Hey @realDonaldTrump....
What's truly a shame is that you reside @1600 Pennsylvania!!!

Focus on the graph below...
Well I'll tell you what the Lord has recorded the idle word that that Montana individual had said the consequences are going to be greater than he anticipated shame on him because he shall be accounted for Every Idle Word that he had done lied and deceit deception!
Being "dishonest and sick" didn't stop you getting into the @WhiteHouse Donny Boy.
@realDonaldTrump  Oh look if u  shuffle the deck Gen.Kelley to head VA ...Admiral Jackson becomes Chief of Staff and u get a twofer/ Dr. n Chief of Staff. Then u just "Trumped" Tester!
can you say zero taxes ( c) the morons in charge now you know why we went to war with England over 10% of our hard earned labor to elite fools who think they know best what lie we should buy into #Clue-rich works for government #GoAlllZeroTax on them they earned it Liars #kag

Admiral Jackson is the CANDY MAN!! You COLLUDED with RUSSIA! You are a FRAUD!! Russian Collusion, Russian Golden Shower, Debt to Russian Bank and Russian affair with Putin!
The only thing fake, phony and illegitimate is Trump.
Turns out Pence’s doctor sent three memos with concerns over Jackson. So there was documentation. More lies from our fake President

These serial LIARS NEED to be held accountable!!!!!
PERHAPS YOU should NOT believe everything told U by the Secret Service which has so many things to hide. Their job is to protect You, NOT deceive You. Especially since other so called intelligence Agencies say different.
Sad 
He should be kicked out of office he’s not an honorable person
Please READ And Re-Tweet
For the king of false statements you're hardly the one to be pointing fingers.
Would you prefer a blatant anti-semite in the Senate? Patrick Little openly espouses anti-semitic views on his Twitter feed. Is this where our country is going?

Jon Tester has had a pattern of story telling throughout his career.  The people of Montana deserve and should know better.
Sounds like you need to fire another swamp traitor in your midst ... Dr. Jennifer Pena .... If what she is, in fact, the source of the Jackson lies, she needs to be charged via the UCMJ

You are sick and you should resign !
Tester is an honorable, truthful, kind hearted man (you are the opposite of all these qualities)who always fights for the best for Montana. He listens to the people and he’s for the people. You don’t have any dirt on him, so quit trying to make him look bad.
Stay strong president trump your report card speaks for itself keep going forward like you have been doing don’t comment on the BAIT . Screw them . Keep your eye on the prize. Your doing a great job.
Continue ignoring all the soothsayers, cynics, & naysayers. Ignore those who NEVER have anything good to say. There’re probably miserable people anyway. The know it alls. The ones that hate life and want everyone else to be unhappy to. We are praying for you God is in control.

How bout this Spanky
 Since you are so hell bent on Tester resigning over this......If any of the allegations are proved to be true....WILL YOU PLEDGE TO RESIGN??????
I guess @SenatorTester wasn’t far off about #RonnyJackson, huh?
Let the @SecretService make their finding public!! If YOU are telling the #truth make it all transparent!! #SupportJonTester #AmericanIdiot #MoronInChief #TrumpRussia #WagTheDog #ObstructionOfJustice
It doesn't change the fact that Jackson  IS NOT QUALIFIED  to run the the VA! Stop it! You choose people who are unqualified for every position then complain when they can't pass a security check, vetting or confirmation hearings. The problem is your candidates, not the process.
President Trump, put Dr Jackson's nomination up for a vote and force them to vote him down. They are liars and cowards!!!
