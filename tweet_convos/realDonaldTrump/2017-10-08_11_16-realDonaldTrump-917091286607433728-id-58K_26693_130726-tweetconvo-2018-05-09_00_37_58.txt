Sooo, you wasted tax payers dollars on a bullshit pr stunt. You're such a loser!

Many hungry children could have been fed school lunches with the $252,000 you spent on this stunt! You should be ashamed...  BAD #Resist
Was Pence kneeling when you asked him?

do u cry everyday
But you don’t ask Mikey to get off his knees whenever he’s in front of you?
What youre jealous?
Maybe you know something I don’t know about Mikey and the Moron?
You sound like a teenager!
Keep up the great work @VP and @SecondLady !!! #MAGA  #BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors #BoycottESPN
@Americanwaste you missed some
You are the person disrespecting our country every day..every minute more you are in office..you are and will always be an embarrassment!
I wish your lack of emotional intelligence shocked me @realDonaldTrump. #NotMyPresident
WE , who love our BEAUTIFUL and STRONG USA , and ALL of OUR FOLLEN COMRADES , DESERVES A LITTLE LOVE BACK , and RESPECT FOR OUR VETS,PLEASE!
Twitter is full of SCAM ARTIST and Fake News


You tell him @BonkersMad Stupid fat orange f***wit
Pence followed like a lap dog. He won't make waves. He is waiting for U 2 finally do something so offensive that he'll slide into POTUSVILLE
How manykids are going to bed tonight hungry in the United States? @VP hope you are proud .....
Reimburse our tax $ both if you are crooks taking our money #taxCheats #demonicBeast @VP U owe us over 250k #racistDemonicPigs #impeach
You are proud of yourself for making him look like a fool. You are stealing ALL OF OUR MONEY YOU CROOK

PLEASE RESIGN!
At least I'm in good company. 
Then you should pay the police dept. the $14,000 your silly stunt cost. You're always telling everyone how rich you are. You pay!!
So you think white men carrying confederate flags in Charlottesville isn't disrespecting our country but black men taking a knee is?? Wow!!
Idiot wasting tax dollars. He will bankrupt USA
wow 
A draft dodger wanking on about players disrespecting the country, priceless
You are so self obsessed and delusional. You should be listening to the people that elected you, not the voices in your enormous head.
to obtain greatness invites jealousy, to continue in greatness invites victory, our only choice is to walk that road humbly, Good Job
So... he protested? 
Y r u orange


Lowest IQ President Ever! And Deplorable VP con artist. Sad! #trumptrainwreck
So rather than respect the Constitution which you both swore in your Oath Of Office to uphold, your stooge had a hissy fit by proxy? Got it.

Her name is Mother

You owe the taxpayers $250,000 for this stunt!
Bull Shit...this was nothing more than a stunt and cost the Police Dept. dearly. #DraintheTrumpSwamp
What a waste of taxpayer's money for an idiotic publicity stunt. "VP Pence's Colts game walkout cost police $14,000."
I can't wait to see you in your orange jumpsuit. #lockTrumpup
It is odd that you are asking for people to respect the flag when you are the first one to disrespect the people of the USA.  So if the people are not respected by you how do you want them to show any respect for a flag?
Sure U did!! Nobody wants U or VP to participate at any public event. U can't even invite people to the WH. They say no!! That started

I asked @VP Pence to leave white house if any daycare workers kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
Apparently you asked him to spend a crazy amount of taxpayer dollars to be a paid protester.
Thank you President Trump and @VP for your respect to America. It's sad that we are divided over standing for our flag. God speed. 
@POTUS @VP Sad to see the president and VP have time to talk about NFL but none to talk about #CaliforniaFires #Notashow
Hypocrite 
Spending too much time on NFL.  More important things like Puerto Rico, Las Vegas, and Russia hacking/influencing 2016 presidential election
Karen's an alien !!!
Wait, is that the Second Lady, the second wife, or the real Second Lady? 
#25thAmendment
#ICantEvenHandleThreeHolesWithoutCheating

Will you be covering the cost of his stunt because taxpayers are waiting it to be paid back??
Why is his peaceful protest okay but others exercising that right are "sons of bitches"? You need to read the Constitution again little D
Leave the White House, you are disrespecting our country.
Respect your armed forces by exercising your right to the democracy they helped to establish and defend #bendtheknee
If you aren't allowed to disrespect your country then you're living in a dictatorship
Your comment about POW's and how you like people who weren't captured was a million times more disrespectful to this country and to veterans
Me president when are going to grow up the world is waiting you act like a spoiled 12 year old

Why don't you left wing nuts Talk abt Hillary selling our uranium to Russia You don't want to admit to the fact that she is crooked Hillary
Thanks for wasting tax dollars.  Next time, flip the bill yourself.
Our country consists of immigrants too. You disrespect them all the time!!! The audacity of you!!!
You are dividing our country with you lies. You are FAKE!!
If you had to pass an IQ test & a 5th grade civics class - you would fall all the way around.

It's the players Constitutional RIGHT to kneel !!!!  Trump & Pence just cost taxpayers a BUNDLE in Tax Dollars !!!! What a waste !!!!!
I'm around of vice president also.and you&your wife!do not let obmshs take over like he's trying. To do.arrest him now!!he's a snake!
Collusion with your VP on an unconstitutional narrow minded taxpayer funded PR stunt.  Deplorable. You work for us. # resign
If they want to knee then send them to Afghanistan, I bet they stand really quick after just one day over there
Then leave our country for disrespecting millions of Americans (women, Hispanics, Muslims).
#BoycottNFL you suck  @NFL get politics out of sports #StandForOurAnthem respect our nations  we are done with @NFL
So @VP can protest but @NFL players cant?  And the ticket's already paid for so #VP 's boycott doesnt do anything.
Proud of wasting more taxpayer money?? Very presidential!
If I kneel at the White House will you also leave office?
I am asking you to leave the White House if you disrespect our country and it's citizens daily. I'm not proud of you. Leave please. Thanks.
Trump/Pence NFL stunt brings the total of taxpayer$ Trump, his family & cabinet have wasted to $1,232,943,000 That’s a good start to #FixACA
So will you be reimbursing taxpayers for that shallow, petty publicity stunt?

Must be nice to have a VP that kisses your fat cheeks!!!
Sir, So now you are bullying Mike Pence into dis-respecting his home team, who stood for the anthem?
You asked Pence to leave as a distraction to your myriad of ongoing failures and your impotent response to Puerto Rico.
And you should leave the WH as well!
You’re the most disrespectful thing in our country.
FYI- This country was founded on a protest. Players who kneel are exercising their rights as citizens,honoring those who fought for freedom.
And how much did your pathetic stunt cost American taxpayers?  Loser. #25for45
Did people applaud as he left Donnie?
In other words, you told @Mike_Pence to use taxpayer $ to stage a political stunt politicizing the #NationalAnthem
I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
You're a drama queen and you don't understand the value of a $. Of course you'd advise him to waste $200K.
I love how you don't even try to disguise the fact that the whole thing was a planned PR stunt! LOL
boy, 130,000 likes you are popular,
So you ordered/forced Pence to leave. Talk about freedom #RealityStar #WWIII
RUDE 
you’re a child
at $250k taxpayer dollars. Publicity stunt. Fail!
He was already scheduled to leave brother. Trump why can’t you bring Americans together. Some people will never understand
you were quoted in an article by @guardian
I for one am tired of a draft dodger lecturing on patriotism. Especially when you deliberately misinterpret the message. Draft dodger
Why don't you meet with peaceful protestors and listen to their concerns instead of shaming them?
Your little stunt wasted American taxpayers' money.
You would be proud of #MikePence ridiculous waste of #Taxpayer $$$ for political stunt. #TakeAKnee has greater significance than u'd grasp!
Your the only one that is disrespecting our country. You should step down, you are unfit to lead. Disgraceful human being.
So pence really is your puppet. #puppetPence
Stunt to waste time & money. Focus on real issues, i.e., Puerto Rico,  gun violence. ..Las Vegas...homegrown terrorists, police brutality
And when #Pence came back, Trump said “There, that’s a good boy.” And gave him a soft pat on the head.
But you can get on your knees for Putin?
Sue them again like you did with the USFL. Maybe th is time you will get 5.00 instead of 3 dollars and change.
So he protested the protestors ?
You are proud to waste taxpayer money? What is your problem? Oh wait I remember now, you are a rich bigot who doesn't care about equality.
Trump commiting treason is the biggest disrespect to our country of all!  Mueller is coming.....
Oh, so you told him to disrespect The First Amendment to the Constitution. He didn't do it on his own? Just obeying orders from Czar of USA.
I'm proud of them also! I'm proud to have a POTUS & VPOTUS who LOVE &stand up for this country!
THE PLAYERS SHOULD HAVE LEFT WITH HIS ASS...THEY WILL GET IT...VERY SOON
You're a child. You don't even possess enough brain cells to rub together to have the mental capacity to understand the protest. Gfy.
Not impressed. Already knew they were going to kneel! Same as ditching a NK meeting because they're rude... Just drain it!!
You sound like a broken record
Neither of you believe in free speech!
Please see the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. We have free speech in this country!
Isn't little pency such a good boy, you should give him a treat for obeying you.
So you're admitting this was a planned media stunt? Are we paying the bill for this bullshit? #resist #TakeAKnee #NotMyPresident
Please stop doing that. No one is asking for it, and it is an inappropriate use of your office and his
I thought Marla was your second lady?

You wasted a half million dollars on a publicity stunt?
You are both deranged and petty.

But it's ok to let people wave the Flag of Treason in remembrance of disdain for our US Constitution, u know Confed Flag.
A staged PR stunt .. that is truly disrespecting the flag
We R Proud of @VP too!
You suffer from partial brain death w/ everything else?! No wonder the SoS called you "moron" ...
@VP is just another scared old man AKA Trump puppet.
White guy who can't think for himself.
The kneeling bug up your ass won't work to demonstrate how patriotic you are; we know you sold us out to Putin & you don't care about the US
Think of this: Fiscal conservatives don’t disperse taxpayers US$ for their narrow interests.
You two are truly pathetic pieces of shit. #Liars #Phonies
#PenceKnew #TrumpRussia
So you ordered a guy to do something to protest free speech. Do you even KNOW the word “irony?”

So are you going to reimburse us for the money you wasted on this stunt?
You didn't ask him to.  He did it on his own.
And now you're using him to take credit for it.
#Resist
#ImpeachTrump
Did you consider the price for this charade? Unless u and VP pence r paying for it
Thanks for wasting 1/4 of a million dollars on his flight,so who's your bitch Pence or Conway,cause your obviously Putin's.Muller is coming.
Please stop tweeting.
Do you have nothing better to do?
AND PENCE DOES YOUR BIDDING.QUIT SPENDING TAX PAYER DOLLARS SENDING VP TO FOOTBALL GAMES
Use can't even stage shit well ! We have a bunch of f#%king idiots running this nation #Wow #TrumpRussia
A Russian Loving Traitor like Trump has proved he is shows No respect for America
You are CREATING strife in this great country.  It's NOT about USA...only YOU.  You're disgusting, stupid, and YES, a MORON!
You're a traitor, so shut up, hypocrite!
@NFL players kneeling is a non-event.No more attention should  be spent on it. Let it wither on the vine.It's Old news like @HillaryClinton
You spent OUR TAX DOLLARS to set that up. What a CHEAP MOVE by a MORON LOSER and VICE MORON.
THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO PUERTO RICO.
Are you aware that in sports kneeling is a sign of respect for someone who's been injured?  There is nothing disrespectful in the gesture.
I kneeled when my fellow players were hurt in soccer.  They kneel for a broken country and a broken system.  They kneel for the lives lost.
thank you for thinking this is a game show, and wasting more taxpayers dollars!  You suck, cant wait for a real pres to take your place!
Who is disrespecting the country? ?? Any sense of irony?
Thank U sir 4 honoring your country & the men who protect it and the ones who died to protect it Send NFL 2 fight in the war on front lines
@POTUS ~When will you get pissed over #SocialInjustice and respect that #BlackLivesMatter   #VetsTakeAKnee
That’s funny, when you wrote @SecondLady I thought you meant Karen McDougal!

It’s true!

Why is it that the people who benefit the most from American capitalism are the biggest supporters of the left who want to replace it with the kind of government that people left to come to America for the past 2 hundred years?
AqA
yes, people disrespect your national anthem and the Mike Pence disrespect the people of the United States, talk about acting like hes still in Kindergarten haha grow up Mike!
Heather Heyer remember her? Civil rights activist victim of Charlottesville car attack? And you’re worried about somebody kneeling?

Yeah, America is dirt poor when it comes to giving the needy a helping hand but the sky's the limit when it comes to your antics.  No action is too low when it comes to 2-scoops Donnie getting his way.  Disgusting.
@First & Second Lady- For You All, I THANK GOD DAILY.   Thank you.
je vois cmt un Pr vx se defendre
YES, YES, YES....We the people are proud also....If Roger Goodell had given CK 1-2 games penality for his disrepect to-our-flag this would have been done and over with
