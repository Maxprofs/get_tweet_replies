.@realDonaldTrump Do you ever notice all the white supremacists that follow you? Why is that? First to respond to your tweets always
@EclecticLizzie @realDonaldTrump It hasn't gone unnoticed by me and it informs my vote.
Lets just say a man is known both by the company he keeps and the company he attracts.
At what point will you focus on policy rather than pointless Twitter attacks?
Stay on the message Mr. Trump. Individuals are not important, America is. Avoid skirmishes, fight the big battle for USA.
If you have to explain to Trump that he needs to stop being petty & act like a prez candidate, should he be one?
Forget Ryan, media and SNL. Focus on issues & WikiLeaks information now and at next debate.
Do you really want this man for your leader?You all are constantly begging him to stick to issues.He can't #unfit
I know I cannot vote for @HillaryClinton. Am ready for this election to be in rear view mirror.
@MistyStrohl AMERICANS PRAY FOR OUR TROOPS TONIGHT IN MOSEL AGAIN-THANKS TO HILLARYS FUNDED& ARMED ISIS NO HRC NO HRC NO

Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
Paul Ryan along with John Boehner have failed those on the right side.
Some thing you should have checked before the first Debate! Never too late!
#ImWithHer: An Open Letter To #Hillary Clinton, From A Dad With a Daughter: Thank You | People's

POTUS 

Crazy train
you know he won a couple of times, your about to lose. Probably shouldn't talk shit
he's a bum

Women of of the world are now telling Trump "OUR PUSSIES ARE NOT UP FOR GRABS"

Thank you sir.for getting so much done in your first 6 month's of your Presidency. God bless you and your family sir.100%#MAGA
As appropriate now, as when originally tweeted.
@SpeakerRyan #Resign Take the #RINOs with you.
#FullRepeal
 Seems like old times 
How's that coming along?
He sure is winning you over! Do you ever reply to your tweets or just pleasure yourself over the amount of likes you get?
@SpeakerRyan Oh, snap. That wasn't very nice of you, Donald. You should use better manners. tsk tsk tsk
Paul Ryan is Obama's shill for the Democrat party. He has no balls to fight for the American people. We need Mr.Trump!!
you realize Trump has never held a political office, right? Republicans even generally have experience. WTF
both parties are corrupt, that's why we need a non politician. WTF  I can have my own opinion
And now???
Flunky loser. Fake president. Putin is very smart. You? Not so much... Sad!
THIS election is RIGGED by Crooked HILLARy. SO DON'T VOTE!!!!
it's not really intelligent is it
if you don't vote you're giving the election to Hillary
or was that your intention?
Come now dt. You know you shouldn’t talk about your little minions like that. Little Eddie Munster will be hurt.
The sign of a true leader is how quickly he will throw anyone under the bus. 
Ryan is a traitor to the party. replace him.
shouldn't it be you?  You have all the money!
why is it taxpayers that pay for family vacations to Mar-a-Lago?
@RichardTBurnett RID RYAN
@PruneHamp let me count the ways I love this!
but if he hasn't done anything then he is useless like the rest of them.
Let's be honest, folks. Nobody knows how to not win better than Trump! Nobody even comes close! SAD @realDonaldTrump
Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
@SpeakerRyan @ReincePriebus @RNC @GOP @Congress @Senate @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBC
Stop with the Paul Ryan/rigged election bullshit. It's like you're eight years old.
he knows he's losing, so he's trying to save face..
Hillary is gonna when and then everyone is America will be losing and paying the price
it will be a much better lace to live in if she wins, than if Trump won.
we'll all be dead due to the war with Russia and China that she wants because of cyber hacks
Wrong.  We don't go to conventional war with superpowers any more for a reason
you mean the same military you don't help pay for? #crook #NeverTrump #ImWithHer
huh?
he says Paul Ryan need to focus on the military that's the same military Drumf doesn't pay his fairshare of
you clearly have no idea how business taxes work but OK
yeah buddy! Taxes don't pay for education, infrastructure, or the military? Oh please in lighten me!
Here you go. You've been "in lightened" 
I'm having such a great time watching your campaign implode. You deserve everything coming to you on Election Day.  
I'm up. I have a great job, a home, bills are paid, vacationing.. All's good on the Harris Plantation.
What has republicans Offered the African American Community?
yeah neither has voting Republican
you must keep on message.  We need a win.

And you should focus on those things also instead of blaming your failing scampaign on other people.
@chicwillow @SpeakerRyan needs to focus on what We t People want & Not t Corrupt DC Establishment's Greed. @rushlimbaugh
AND I BELIEVE TRUMP WILL!!
I think #Trump meant to say rats. 
Why would anybody vote for the GOP down ticket if they won't vote for the Republican nominee ????
I refuse to vote for Trump. But I will be voting rep down ballot. Because Trump is #unfit. #SexAssault #racist
The problem is you think Hillary is fit after 30 yrs of nothing. You deserve Hillary
Also, are you paying attention - he acts own Rep Party. He wouldn't get anything done. Attacks Media #fascist
You're not paying attention, what has Hillary done for you, the black community over the last 39 years ???
So incompetent that the ppl who nominated him are now begging him to stick to the issues.Train wreck #NeverTrump
Lying to family of dead, open borders, amnesty, refugees, sanctuary cities, these help you people

P. Ryan, you ran on GOP ticket . Trump runs on GOP ticket-republicans voted for him. Stand by Trump Not hard to understand.
what happened to your evidence disproving you didn't grab these women
I put a pox on you #youcanneverfuckagain
Alex Jones told you to say this? #AlexJonesBitch @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #makeamericastupidagain
What would you know about #Vets #Military being like your grandfather(illegal immigrant), a #DraftDodger! He, in #Germany
#DrumpRyan but ONLY TWO THINGS MATTER - #HillaryCrimes #TrumpCHANGE
Paul Ryan will go to eighth circle of Dante's Hell for hypocrites and corrupt politicians.  What a RAT Fink he is!
Military spending is not an issue. We spend (by far) more than any country. Google:"Beware the military-industrial complex"
what are you focusing on? Your reputation?
And for Senior vote Social Security
Great way to pump up the #GOP team.  Kick them in the face, kick them in the privates, hit them when they're down! #LOSER
Paul Ryan isn't going anywhere. Focus on issues. Worry about him later.
bitter, ranting, losing wannabe dictator and Putin  collaborator http://www.dailynewsbin.com/news/roger-stone-fbi-donald-trump/26329/ …
why is @SpeakerRyan on you radar? Stay on #crookedHillary and the election. #neverHillary
you need to focus on your business!
You are unhinged!
stay on message about Hillary and ignore Ryan or you will alienate even more voters. Ignore Ryan beat Hillary.
ALEX JONES, Trump's "Sect of State"         @realDonaldTrump
Ryan was part of the demise of Romney's failed campaign
Just remind me, how many elections have you won in 70 years?

leave him alone. He will come back
Soon both of you can brag about being losers. #LoserDonald
so when you lose you'll blame Pence for not knowing how to win?
you are the equivalent of a school yard bully.
@PRyan @Reince...I don't donate to republicans anymore because of Ryan, Romney, Bush, Kasich, etc..the establishment
Paul Ryan is a great conservative leader. Stop trying to destroy your own party while you crash and burn.
huge if true
Judas
tell it like it is Donald I hope to hell you WIN This November ...... God Speed

and now you are losing so I think u and your old pal has something in common again
you should pay your fair share to support our country, our teachers and our armed forces and vets
@SpeakerRyan is a good man...he makes an effort to do the right thing most of the time.
You're unfit to lead and you're damaging this country.
You know, if Trump was not happily married, he would hv f..ked Ivanka hard & thought her as a piece of ass while doing so.
Paul Ryan has more integrity & smarts in his little finger than u do in your whole being
We LOVE you Mr. Trump #RecallRyan
you should have a mental health test you are so unhinged showing horrible temperament and judgement crazy
If @SpeakerRyan doesn't know how to win, then why is he in elected office and you're at home ragetweeting?
Maybe #Ryan didn't win because #elections were corrupt or is that only the case when YOU lose elections? #LaughableLogic
what about you? What are your policies?
Instead of worrying about what everyone else should do, wouldn't it be better for you to address the new NBC poll? 11 down

WIN at all cost.  Trump/trample others on the way to the top. dirty fighting is how YOU win.  nothing to be proud of.
With 2 weeks till the election, when will @realDonaldTrump recognize it's @HillaryClinton he needs to defeat & not Paul Ryan?
Stop talking about him and fight the real enemy #CrookedHillary @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls
yep, because you're going to have high expectations on him when your inaugurated like he's never seen before!
you clearly have a problem with people who regain their conscience. #Totalitarianism101
you r just a crazy man! Get out and leave us sane people
do you only care wining by any means
please be ready for the "its illegal to posses hacked emails" argument. SCotus already said this is not true. Get the case#

@SpeakerRyan You are a traitor. Get the bleep out of the Republican Party!
don't worry about Ryan. I predict he won't get reelected. Need to air ads detailing Clinton foundation pay to play
Can he help to get the hidden 302's
karma will get him. focus. Issues. @POTUS @HillaryClinton records attack!
Watch what you http://say.You  are going to look like even more a FOOL when you lose. Oh wait, already setting up excuse-"Rigged"
Focus on the prize, defeating Hillary.  Stop feuding with fellow Republicans.  Be Presidential and win the White House!
Cry me a river! #boohoo
@PaulManafort
Paul Ryan, is & has been part of the  'Rigged System' - why he defends it so ferociously! Virtue signalling!
Virtue signalling to the Media who he thinks will love him!
QUIT picking at stupid crap and bring out the now proven facts about that crooked bunch. Tell the stories until all know
stop the complaint, and stay on policies, border, jobs, security, healthcare, education. These r the things we want to here
YOU are speaking to the 3rd in line for #POTUS when u lose he can make ur life a living hell Donald.
Plse leve Ryan n his buds alone, lost cause. Focus on wiki leaks n how u r gning to save America n make her great n safe!!
Us Veterans not illegals need places to live, health, n something besides trash can food to eat!!!!
Ryan is a total loser.
<--- What does RStone have on you that he is threatening to release? Interesting isn't it...
You need to bring the party together - not increase the cracks. This is how you will lose support by targeting the Team.
FOCUS
please don't stop running. You are the only way Hillary will get elected.
.@realDonaldTrump What about a failed run 16 years ago?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2000 …

Overgrown bully. You'd want to lay down your plans for when your president.  sorry I just got a little sick there.
