Of course, #Nafta and other bad trade deals have decimated the middle class! @HillaryClinton WANTS MORE BAD TRADE - bye jobs
@Mitt_Fit @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton  Bill signed NAFTA!
Hopefully some undecideds were researching & will learn the truth about political hacks negotiating our terrible trade deals.
If they take time 2 learn about NAFTA, and TPP is on the board! Very serious stuff!
Bill ratified NAFTA and Hillary fully supported it. —end of story.

point noted Mel, but Bush isn't running so in the context it doesn't matter about that.
it's not the candidate running - it's the party
actually with all due respect it's really two ideologies. “Americanism vs Globalism”
@Drdetroit45 @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton trump won because he's not like her. Easy point political pundits miss....
for Years we have been demanding USA produce at our grocery store. Store blames NAFTA.
@rushlimbaugh I donated to your campaign today, Donald--We need you to go after her!
Donald, watch and learn!
so does that graphic mean that nobody fact checked any of your other bullshit?? I hope not!
Actually NAFTA negotiated by G HW Bush's team and signed by Bush, not Clinton. He just held vote

- You schooled them, President Trump. 
ones who pay attention. ...knew!
@ITGuy1959 #ur campaign is starting to 
keep telling Trump how great he is. It'll result in a much harder fall when he loses in Nov
Trump looking a reality on Nov 9
bring it up at the next debate and see if you don't get schooled on it smart guy.
Wasn't that effective? We'll know on November 8. On to the next GOP comedy - debate.
@Trump_Videos She wants raise taxes ask her last time she tried to rid budget of pork spenders Save 1St what happened to red pen
Hillary's eyes spin and roll around in every direction. She's physically unfit for office
you are so right Hilary might lose her eyesight

@realDonaldTrump #Hillary's oxymoron ad #Hillary spent her life dedicated to #children & dedicated to #aborting them @TeamTrump @AC360

and if you want even more proof of corruption #FollowTheMoney
NAFTA signed by Bush the elder.  Most people did WELL in the 90s. You choked badly.  HOW??

Go after her pay for Play !!!!!! Go after her harder Donald we can't stand that liar !!!
Hillary you are not very truthful
Too bad @HillaryClinton was far more googled name than yours. SAD!
Clinton noted that she opposed CAFTA. Why did she bring it up- because it sounds like NAFTA.
even the host was telling you to stop interrupting thats kinda rude notice she only interup. 1ce
Bore us, Donald, do.
@lynn_weiser @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton ginrich and many others were in favor. All are traitors
Anyone born by say 1985 knows exactly what NAFTA is so what does that tell you all
No doubt NAFTA killed our manufacturing in this country.
@DclareDiane @realDonaldTrump FAIR TRADE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. WE DON't HAVE THAT IN ANY OF OUR AGREEMENTS. #MAGA @twitter
2nd amendment rights!!!  Please follow!
That trade agreement resulting in millions of Americans thrown into the jobless streets = RACISM

TPP R not pro-America,just like HRCs Ref Program!
@AllenWest what does this http://tell.you  when compared to most googled
You're wrong. If you look closer, Hillary's wardrobe malfunctions. You can see some grandma nip.
lol how do you not think this will be bad for you? You need a new campaign team....
@Kingairpilot68 @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton What's most surprising is people had to look that up.
Trump proved he's a Gentleman, Hillary proved shes a bitch. End of story #TrumpTrain #Trump2016

Donald, Donald, first debate over. You lost.
Trump loves trade when he's spending money, hates it when stumping for votes. Total hypocrisy.
Geniuses... that's a BAD thing for your guy.

he knew it would never sustain a veto because it was heavily supported by congress
lol... NAFTA was written by Bush 1st. Bill Clinton only signed it b/c it was a done deal
That just shows that nobody knows what the hell you were talking about
most people have no idea what NAFTA is
we are Har hillary not trump
Amen and Amen!!!  Tell Hillary and use her own famous words..."What difference does it make!!"
Good!  Maybe people are educating themselves. She also used to support traditional marriage.
Got Analytics?
.@realDonaldTrump calling out @HillaryClinton's support for NAFTA = most searched moment during tonight's debate. #Debates2016 
 @HillaryClinton we don't believe your lies.  We Americans can fact-check for ourselves. #MAGA
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/debate-caucus-trump-clinton-228757 …
NAFTA helped bring world illegals into Mexico, making their country less safe, too. Not good!
what do you know, this is a lie
Americans care about jobs. Hilary means less jobs.
YES. Plenty of fact checking.
That's because your supporters had to Google what NAFTA is you schmuck
#debate2016
still lying Donald.
Actually that spike is when she referenced fact checking on her website
Sadly Trump doesn't understand the history of importance of #NATO #DJTIsNotPresidential
@nexxoexxon @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton you got my vote Trump let's send this old lady to a retirement home

#MAGA>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Bill Clinton destroyed the textile manufacturing industry in USA with NAFTA http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/cotton-wool/background/us-textile-and-apparel-industries-and-rural-america.aspx …
Was the clintons who signed it into law. Really worked out great for everyone but the USA!!

Millenialls don't have a clue what NAFTA is. HRC doesn't want them to know either. Explain it.
Says the guy who outsources work to other countries.
Did you check it after you lied about China and Global Warming? LMAO
.@TeamTrump U know damned well that the usual job migration and automation caused most job losses, but NAFTA did bring some jobs here.
That was just millennials Googling what "NAFTA" means. BoomerTalk.
I hope next debate you'll ask why they're hiding about the stolen funds for haiti by the @cfoundationsrws
@BillClinton created #WTO & #NAFTA & #CAFTA.
#Clintons are #globalist #Marxists: #antiAmerican!
has the Trump team gotten paid yet, I bet not
you realize NAFTA was actually a Bush Sr thing right?
wasn't that off of cnn? The network you don't watch
Good job patting yourself on the back for the worst performance in debate history?

45 times Clinton pushed trade bill she CLAIMS she now opposes

-H you were outstanding. Trump looked like a baby who wet his pants and wanted to go home.
You never get anything right, do you.. Tsk.
#BillClinton supported #NAFTA and created #WTO and #PNTR= devastated Americans!
Ya, America is a "disaster" & "in ruins".Heard it all.WTH do you think you live, Haiti?
#Canada use to be free. Sad!
#USA will not be going down that marxist rabbit hole
Keep it up, and you'll be going down the Russian Trump hole. Great, eh?
Perhaps you missed it. Russia is now a representative capitalist democracy.
Go away, you fucking religious hypocrite. Stick your head back up DT's ass. Your kind is the WORST.
When did this conversation get religious? Hypocrite is one who claims to for liberty but campaigns for #Hitlery's tyranny=You
LOL! NAFTA signed by Prez 41 not Clinton. Study your US History better than this.
@Billclinton's top advisor told me, Bill signed NAFTA because he thought China would buy our food HE WAS WRONG!
Even Middle Class/working class Democrats are against NAFTA.
She will just dip into the Clinton Foundation from her pay to play scam and pay media off

Hillary Clinton goes the distance as Donald Trump punches himself out: http://thebea.st/2d5t99w  
right before they searched out the long list of businesses he cheated
Even I had to google what NAFTA was, and I'm running for president.  #SAD #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN
Too bad even Fox thought he lost.  http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/27/hillary-won-first-debate-it-helps-to-be-prepared.html …

#Trump theorem of #QuantumMechanics, proof of #TwoStateSystems
His reality exists in two-states
US exports to Mexico increased more than 400% since NAFTA.

It's called fact checking. You lose.
oh I don't know about that - I think the tax release being compared to her emails was the best

#DonaldTrump got it right


Trump in the green room before the debate #TrumpSniffle 
hmm, all i see in the image is "Trump interrupts Clinton". is there anyone you don't interrupt?
what about your drug use?  Sex parties?  Raping a 13 year old?
Globalist CNBC and Market declare Hillary winner! USA first enemies elites support Hillary!
Payment attention @realDonaldTrump You interrupted @HillaryClinton.
You are not fit for office, rude and disrespectful to all.
As a Canadian I can say thanks to America for NAfta. There was so much work and I learned so much about the USA.

Hillary was FOR it, and there's no way she can say otherwise!

This was not Clinton's plan.  George HW Bush tried to fast track it before he left office.

Go home #CommunistClinton Troll...
Donald, do you realize how much American farmers made off of #NAFTA? You want to repeal?
you keep throwing around the same few phrases while avoiding answering HOW you will do anything
was FLOTUS during NAFTA development & enactment. She didn't work on it!
What's it like to have ZERO impulse control, you loony sociopath? #ImWithHer #Hillary2016
