@LouDobbs @VP @SpeakerRyan @marcorubio PR Govn't w/Gim-me, Gim-me Attitude Not Good Thanks geraldo, MrTrump did FANTASTIC, Texas,Florida& PR

Does anyone understand the difference between repairing an existing infrastructure and building an infrastructure from the ground up. duh
If I’ve ever wanted to trip someone it’s you, you sell out
Thanks for telling truth Geraldo tell the truth the teamsters are blocking truck drivers from delivering supply with the help of the mayor
Frente Amplio is not Teamsters.
Can u ship some drivers over from the states
77 were flown down on Wednesday:
Awesome  that's story needs to get out
Geraldo your the one that is fake and you have proven it each time you so call report. One more thing stop calling yourself puerto rican
Go away! @GeraldoRivera
Why? You don’t like him telling the truth?
He's a phony
Here is another reason to revoke press passes "Obstructing Federal Relief operations". Revoke FNN press passes.
??? Geraldo??? That's all you got? Damm
#FakeNews #FakePresident
Since Geraldo is with Fox News, he is by definition a lying SOS
Let's gather around and listen to your revelations of Al Capone.
Geraldo, as a P.R. Yourself , that went back to P.R. To report the truth, thank you for being honest about the situation, and our President!
Yahhh we should listen to u
Geraldo happy man. He's finally back in the spotlight.
When you disrespect the President by using hashtags like #TrumpIsAMoron or #Dotard, you're only inviting more mass shootings and hurricanes.

Hey Geraldo, isn't there another safe you need to open?
Didn’t knew Geraldo is still alive.
Majority of the people in Puerto Rico are genuinely awesome folks. that mayor has put a halt to her political career by her hateful rant.
Mr. #FakeHair stop with the fake news and the paper towel tosses. Puerto Ricans are people too.
So tired of the fake news label. Right. Any critical story is labeled fake news. What a joke.
Let's see...do I believe Geraldo, irrelevant loser that he is, or many local journalists. Plus... there's video of you doing stupid stuff!!
Bigote come mierda!
I haven't always agreed with Geraldo but this time I appreciate his honesty!#conditions in 
That's interesting...because he's lying
Oh and btw...you haven't been valid since opening a vault of Al Capone...i was in HS.   Lol
What's fake real video footage of him throwing paper towels at people or him saying LIVE it's not a real tragedy? #fakePresident
YUP, HIS VISIT WAS A JOKE, HE BASICLLY INSULTED EVERYONE ON THE ISLAND.
. In YOUR eyes or theirs?
No fake news. Just a fake president
How’s it fake? When there’s video of Trump flipping paper towels into the crowd? Another Fox News sheep. Do as your told sheep!
Good @GeraldoRivera
The necrophagous #MSM vultures
are spreading their #adipocere
stench around
@LeenieKatSTL
@normagilbert54
@TBERRI01
Today, and @NBCNews wrong story about Tillerson resigning threat continues to show media us the opposition, and not valid news reporting
The guy who hoaxed America into thinking he found Al Capone’s secret vault? Yeah, really credible...lol
Which part was fake?
Thank you Geraldo... we love our president!!!
How much lower can you go when @GeraldoRivera is the bar that you measure “fake news” by #Staterunmedia #fauxfoxnews #trumpeffect #failing
We call BULL! Way to add fuel to the misinformation. Send someone to #PR to talk to the ppl actually there, @FoxNews, or stay out of it! 
I agree in away with you.I know there's situation happening in my Island but the help is there, local Gov need to get better in logistics.
Supplies aren’t being moved. How are there no helicopters?Why can’t supplies be dropped in more remote areas?Supermarkets empty in SJ! Why?
This isn’t about local gov not doing their part. Full containers sitting in docks.We should be asking why.
Roads in San Juan are clear enough. Why can’t my cousin find meat? Water? Arguments blaming PR have no basis.
I think the island was not prepared for the aftermath of this devastating hurricane.The problem is logistics. Any administration would've it
Remember when he said he would shave his mustache if OJ was found Not Guilty? Well if he lies about something like that then why believe him
Christ Geraldo, you work for the mother of fake news. Seriously  ?
Geraldo also believed there was something in Al Capone's vault.
GERALDO WE KNOW YOU LIKE THE MAN.

Fake president
GERALDO RIVERA???
TALK ABOUT DESPERATE!!!
Trump toured Guaynabo area, not a devastated area like Juncos, or Laras. 95% of island has no electricity and he said flashlights not needed
Guaynabo is a concentrated corporate base. Of course it looks great there! Only place cell phone reception is 100%.

Geraldo, wasn't he human once, Crump? Credible? Please! The fake news dodge won't keep the #TrumpCrimeFamily out of Leavenworth.
Nothing like a good gaslighting in the morning.

I’ll blast YOU for fake news
Press is aggressively watchful of Pres. However, many of his challenges come from his exact quotes- he is a terribly Undisciplined speaker
Obama was "disciplined" bc the elitists used him as a puppet in Washington swamp. He did & said what they told him! We have a true leader!!!
Lana how cam you call him a true leader   he has zero leadership skills I think he is a spineless liar
No,it's the left &deep state that are liars and trying everything up their sleeve to out trump!!
Ok.
How about when Trump talked to himself in Virgin Islands? He is their president and had no idea!
Please explain what's fake.....
It's all been explained, and ur a reporter?
Lmao ya probably paid the poor guy
That's funny. I have family and friends there and not one of them was happy about the visit by Grabby. They'd rather see some choppers dropping food and water and boots on the ground helping clean up and restore power.
#AlertTheDaycareStaff
Jodio vendido you are an embarassment ti the latino community in the USA. Defending that orange guy
So sad that @GeraldoRivera would rather kneel for the Pretender in Chief than stand for his people. This guy made a mockery of this tragedy!
Click and Scroll. Everybody link back to this, my account, and my tweets:

@GeraldoRivera #Molester
Lol - it is like the Liars Club - Trump, Fox, Heraldo...what a trio...the worst of America.
Mostly Stupid. Hillary is the QUEEN of lies.
Now I wonder why they got Geraldo to do this bit, hmmm.

What is different about him compared to other Fox News superstars?

Hmmm...
You mean Gerry Rivers?
I mean Señor Geraldo Rivera.
Right. Gerry Rivers.
He is still relevent?
Most people didn't even know he was there because they have no power or communication.
I’d say when even Geraldo is telling it like it is, that the fake news is getting it wrong, it’s apparent the fake news is getting it wrong.
Geraldo needs a paycheck that bad?! Be careful, your name is still Geraldo!!
How can you trust anyone with that thing on their face. He looks so Fake.
Fake news is searching for Hoffa.  Why are you still reporting?
Yea right.
This guy looks like he would do anything for money
Someone put this guy in a vault!
we are horrified
Lol he’s not real news
Shame on you Geraldo
Do you also understand why the American people of PR are frustrated.  You’re a hack and always have been.

...and the paper towel toss goes viral!
As if Geraldo has been a reliable journalist in this decade.  PPFFFT
I seem to remember part of his interview wherr he said he was underwhelmed w/supplies coming in.....
So he never went there?
Good for him!
Did @GeraldoRivera report this from where he left his credibility, Capone's vault...
You mean “Al Capone’s vault” Gerald Rivers, that Geraldo?
Geraldo is irrelevant and has been for years
You were always a idiot and now you are a deplorable idiot.
when u last rellavant? yes never!
Fox News is the king of fake news.  Geraldo is a has been nut job.
Nobody in their right mind listens to Geraldo Rivera...he lost credibility with America years ago. Sad. Loser. Trumpet
Fox is the real fake news.

Geraldo was a true reporter in his youth, then he became a bought and sold pawn.
LOL. doesn’t this attention whore have a vault to open or a chair to catch with his face? #FauxNews
BTW Puerto Rican's are very welcoming and respectful unlike your President!
This guy is a partisan hack. We want acknowledged experts in the field of politics and media like Scott Baio and James Woods. LOL @ these morons.
@GeraldoRivera
Send help to US VIRGIN ISLANDS! They're AMERICANS TOO!
Geraldo is brain damaged and still looking for Al Capone’s vault. Be serious!
what was fake? you minimized tragedy, visited areas that were not hit badly & ignored that 93% has no electricity, & millions lack water
@GeraldoRivera Did any of you get of the beach and move inland? You only saw what you wanted to, least damaged, most afluent area.
The ppl who really stepped up to plate, long b4 trump went for photo op
WHAT is his problem???!!  DISOWNED!
He hasn't found anything in Al Capone's vault there, either.
Thank you Geraldo for reporting the facts. You have worked hard for Puerto Rico. God bless you!
FOX IS MOST FAKE OF ALL
He's the original fake news.
LOLOLOLZZZZZZZZZZ
Shut up you buzzard.   You are all wash up.

Lol Geraldo you are one of the biggest purveyor of fake news along side Alex joans
Geraldo you're so yesterday, their is an empty vault with your name on it
There, I hate spell check
You might be right. The news IS fake. That isn't the word on the street in Puerto Rico.
What happened to you Geraldo, you used to be cool. Hanging with fox crowd, not cool
Paul Krugman didn’t just get sloppy, he got caught and called for being a liar!  We should not let him forget that.
Wow! If left leaning Geraldo is taking up for President Trump, MSM must really suck.
LittleDonald's FakeNews caught up with him... he will fire the entire FakeNews Dept.
Well Geraldo needs his paycheck I guess.
FoxNews one sided and biased reporting.
Good job, Geraldo.  Tell the truth!  Blast the fake news mongers.
This guy is the king of fake news. Go find another vault.
https://twitter.com/TranslateRealDT/status/916057331368124416 … #MAGA @gop #bumpstocks NFL
Geraldo Pathetically Attempts Relevance By Parroting My 'Fake News' Excuse For Any Unflattering True Stories About Me. https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/915613492224434177 …
Geraldo had another Al Capone moment with Mayor Cruz..she wasted him. Who will he rebuild himself to be now?
And Geraldo is a pillar of trust?
I am real sure they appreciated all those paper towels Santa Claus was tossing out also.  @GeraldoRivera You are still with that fake news!?
Geraldo's longest trips take about 58 steps to the nearest toilet, where he has his stash of prescribed suppositories to help him with flaring hemroids. That's the extent of his travels to Puerto Rico. #fakenewsfox
Live from Al Capone's safe. lol
Somebody needs to punch @GeraldoRivera in the nose  tú no eres puertorriqueño. Eres un falso reportero apoyas un racista
Can't remember the last time I watched Fox news... lol
Only visited safe and relatively good holiday resort areas so how the hell would anyone know if people happy....17 minute PR press conf
Good for you @GeraldoRivera .

Poor Geraldo...good bye reputation as a journalist...Faux New Pimp Daddy
Bahaha you must be super worried about that Dossier if you’re retweeting @GeraldoRivera maybe Capone hid something in Puerto Rico! #Resign
Because Geraldo is a solid dude, and someone you wanna tie yourself to. Said no one ever.
I heard that Al Capone's gold is in Puerto Rico, and the only way he can find it is to side with Trump.
Thank you Geraldo for supporting our President!
Someone please tell Geraldo to stfu. No one has any respect for him or his “journalism”.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider Talk about propaganda! Ha!
Geraldo who?
Thank you Geraldo for speaking the truth
Geraldo Rivera 
Geraldo you are a no talent journalist who has no business being on television you're a hack. I hear McDonald's has openings
WOW how much did you get paid Gerardo? Who but a child throws paper towels at those suffering . He is a idiot trump is
... What the hell is that on his face?
Is this fool trying to get a job on the apprendice white house edition?
Did Trump or did he not see the real Devastation in Puerto Rico or was he just shown the nice parts
What was fake...the whole world saw him!  Geraldo...go dig up another vault...talk about fake news!
Geraldo who?
Gerald is a washed up has been. He used to hate white supremacists, he used to beat them up...now it seems he helped get one elected. Scum.
More @FoxNews?If u don't like fake news don't tweet it!Fox is under FBI counterintel invstgtn re:Russian propaganda & u're promoting it! smh
Geraldo is a fake as the come.  His stories are nothing but lies.

1) This is a former Staff Sergeant and Calvary Scout. He is in Puerto Rico. He's telling you the truth. FEMA and POTUS are lying to us. 
It's always hilarious to me how fake Christians can applaud the devil himself
Lol@geraldo. Who knew he was even still around
Geraldo you are so good at reporting your point of views rather that the actual news....
I did not know that Geraldo was a Trump ass kisser.  But then I guess someone has to keep the FAKE president smiling!
Fox and Lies with Geraldo reports are fake news? I think the 71 yr old QB throwing paper towels not fake @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
Blasts? That's what you call a blast? Honey...
geraldo you are fake and not a news-person..go find a vault somewhere and crawl into it.

So...@realDonaldTrump didn't say idiotic things and lob paper towels at hurricane victims or people weren't suffering or both? #MoronFoxNews
What happened Geraldo? You were a stand up guy when you worked with Jerry Provencal and Plymouth Center. Seems you lost your moral compass.
FYI Liberals, Geraldo is a liberal
What is fake? Tell us. FOX news you are on a slippery slope. Of all the news channels you are the only one who reports FAKE NEWS!!
This is a perfect example #senateintelligencecommittee investigate lying, troublemaking #fakenews they MUST be held accountable!
@realDonaldTrump Seems your "blast" helper has no credibility, just like you. #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow FOX NEWS is the #FakeNews
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider is #Geraldo even relevant?!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider you didn't belittle them & tell them they didn't have enough deaths to qualify as a real tragedy?
More whining and bullshit Fox News is the real Fake News. And you're visit to Puerto Rico is a disgrace and not presidential
Great source Geraldo Rivera and fox bahahahahaha ha
