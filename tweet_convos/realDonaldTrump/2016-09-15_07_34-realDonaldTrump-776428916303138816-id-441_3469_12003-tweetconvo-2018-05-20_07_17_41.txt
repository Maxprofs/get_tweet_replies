Presidential nominee @realDonaldTrump visited the Hall of Fame tonight. 
i heard on news you had a nervous breakdown in 1990...is that Y you & ivana dont want your divorce records opened?
nervous break down in 1990 vs seizures in 2016, hmmm...
so many doctors are saying she clearly has Parkinsons, you're in denial
not at all, nobody that has that many problems should be running this country
Oh, I agree - and Trump CLEARLY has MENTAL HEALTH issues and should be institutionalized.
neither of them should be candidates
Clinton wasn't my 1st choice - but she looks like Mother Theresa next to that POS con man
Remember that time when Trump made fun of a disabled person.
hey that was a brilliant and mature and intelligent response. Thank you for validating deplorables. 
why ? I'll conservative. Apparently you aren't. And neither is Trump
brilliant reply
Donald T:  I've always wanted a Lombardi Trophy.  I'll just take this one, it's much easier.
Donald, are you dying? The second Bornstein letter isn't as enthusiastic as the first.

Trump isn't 6'3, weighs 276, eats junk food, no exercise, 70yo. He is a high-risk patient
