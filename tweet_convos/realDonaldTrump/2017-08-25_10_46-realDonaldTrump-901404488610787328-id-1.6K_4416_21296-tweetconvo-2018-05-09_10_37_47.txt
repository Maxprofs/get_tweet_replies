Why the hell are you gutting climate programs? Your thoughts are prayers do nothing. Your policies do a lot, and make these things worse.
The climate is changing, but NOT because of people! Do your homework.
Tell me more about your science expertise.
140 characters is not enough... You might want to turn off MSM... Hint: Oceans are warming up from the inside out.
The oceans are warming as is the lower atmosphere. The upper atmosphere is cooling.  Could it be that CO2 is warming both oceans and air?
Trump retweeting this simply means he's sitting around on Twitter watching TV enjoying the last burning days of his disastrous "presidency"
Gonna be a long eight years 
And all his supporters, including me, are loving every painful moment the dems endure! God is good!
You are loving the pain and division the nation is enduring? Perhaps you would be better suited to life in NKorea because you are UNAMERICAN
I fought for my country and buried my friends fighting for my country. The division is coming from the resist crowd
You have lots of thoughts and prayers for victims of 'unnatural' disasters that you're causing by ignoring climate change. + ur fracking 
Man, you people are WAY out there and proof that your large amygdala is ruling your fact-free world. Sad to people so ignorant/brainwashed.
I'm guessing you think hurricanes are caused by gays?
I am guessing some will blame with out knowledge and start some kind of hate speech! Shame on you.
Shame on who? What hate speech?
I wonder if scientists who relate increase in violent storms to man-made climate change are onto something
They are! How to get rich off stoking sheeples fear of it! Been changing for billions of years without humans. Nature at work.
These ultra-wealthy scientists must be stopped, right?? Right? Um... 
Al Gore.

Resign.! #ImpeachTrump
Resign
If god gave two shits and ever listened to prayers, that hurricane wouldn't be hitting land and wreaking havoc in the first place.

"Closely monitoring" = watching FOX tv

And we are closely monitoring YOU. #RESIGN
Anyone looking to aid ranchers, etc with relocating the animals?
Too bad we have to think about you. #Resign
God bless you. Thank you for monitoring.
Well that's two inepts monitoring the situation.
Sarcasm. Check out my record on this nitwit
I meant Pruitt and god.
So you can can somehow try to finagle a fake study showing how this proves climate change is a hoax?
President Trump is doing things people don't like. But he's also doing the things that need to be done.
Is this tweet being shadowbanned? If so, WHY?!? 
Could you please monitor the storm by standing in the eye? Thanks. #FuckYouTrump #LoserDonald
Ocean temp 86.. highest ever in this season?  Climate change not real? What will you do if there is an oil spill? #swampcabinet
Imagine all of the runoff of fertilizer and deadly pesticides such as chlorpyrifos going into the ocean right now, affecting food chain.

Thoughts & prayers?  Fvk that! Get off your climate-changing-denying- ass, go to Houston & do your fvkking job. Do you know what it is?
Thoughts and prayers don't cut it. Time  to deal with climate change. Another Trumpass idiot

Oh dear, you got 1 or 2 positive replies from those fake trolls, but no one else believes you...
While you're trolling.  You call others trolls. That's fresh
And you troll the troll calling other trolls while trolling...circular chaos at its best. Hilarious.
Did #climate change make Hurricane #Harvey worse?

I am also dismantling the EPA so that these kind of storms will be worse and more frequent. Hope you can swim, poors. K, thanks, byeeee 
It's all good though - He's thinking and praying. That'll work.

What staff? You dismantled a good bit of it.
Really Connor McGregor just pissed off half of the nation and you are worried about a little storm smh
If Texas City gets hit hard and the oil & chemical soup spills into the Gulf and waterways the EPA stands ready to protect residents. Right
Thanks to EPA cuts, disaster victims are placed at greater risk. Science deniers contribute to future mega storms. And you send prayers.
the clean power plan clean water clean air act is here to stay in the us
Could you Paypal me?? Thankygives@gmail.com I know it's global everyone should get the support they deserve
You should fired and jailed for what you're doing to our environment and for making illegal deals with Monsanto! You sir are Evil!
Try admitting that climate change is real.
Oh now I feel soooo much better....
Thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers
Right. So much BS from the Admin
Even our #usamilitary concluded climate change is real, manmade. It affects their operations. If not for us, acknowledge it through them.
1000 national guardsmen is not enough to cover over 6 million people and the amount of land recovery this is Tinker Bell thinking
Ha! You're policies will only make it EASIER for more and more catastrophic hurricanes to form.  It's called climate change!
Thoughts and prayers will do nothing.

Some of you people are crazy. Have any of you donated anything to the recovery effort? No? So all you do is argue. Shameful.
Let us know how much your thoughts and prayers helped.
For us that believe in Jesus Christ Our Savior. Prayer does work and should not be marginalized by those who do not believe.
Prayer is our most powerful God given weapon. Amen.
Then did you pray for Harvey to basically destroy Houston?  If you prayed for it not to then it didn't work.
In The Name Of Lord Jesus Christ. President You R Blessed By God, Anointed. The Holy Spirit Governs Over You.
@GloryB2GodLordJesusChrist
Not Trump or Pruitt. They are the Devil's handiwork. Won't help you or anyone else. Hope prayer soothes you-but they won't-all about $$$
~Thank you @ EPAScottPruitt ...We appreciate all you do :)!  #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Pence #Trump #ThankYou #pray #prayfortexas

He should pray... for forgiveness. In the future, all hurricanes should all be named Hurricane Scott.
True, but God can't forgive him for that.
Thank you Mr President! We know this will not become a mess like Katrina under your strong leadership. The left will still not care though
Wanna bet?
He's already taking action.  This president is amazing
Thought and prayers....@ http://kiliedutravel.com 
If you really cared you'd accept climate science and use your agency to stem its effects and prevent future Harveys.
You're conflating short term weather event with climate. Rookie mistake.
Looks like the hurricane is blowing away a lot of fake news. Russia, gone. Nazis, gone. Mind readers who diagnose mental issues, gone.
Bot #RussBOT
That's your argument. YAWN!
Are you kidding? You are the root cause of #Harvey & all other #climatechange catastrophies! Hoping @FBI takes you too! @AGSchneiderman
Can you explain the hundreds of hurricanes, maybe thousands even, that occurred when climate was static?
Oh, your one of those trolls with the 8 numbers after your name!  Paid Russian??
Can't answer the question. Deflect with nonsense. How about the dozens of stronger hurricanes 50, 60, 100 years ago? Explain please?

While you are cutting all the budgets and revoking order 13690?
@realDonaldTrump Lets Make America Great Again we can come back Twice as Strong I believe We Can! #MAGA #Harvey

The only thing you're interested in protecting is business.
Pruitt surely caused this hurricane due to his ignorance of climate change forces. I'm sure Pruitt will take care of everything! Total dope!
According to gore texas should have washed away by now
God and your great country will see you through
PRAYERS...??? YOU NEVER PRAYED EXCEPT TO ASK FOR MORE!!!
Putin likes Nazis. GOP officials like Gorka. #GorkaResigned #GOPsilent
Christoph Hörstel, the leader of the German anti-Semitic party "Deutsche Mitte", visited Russia-annexed Crimea and met with Putin.

The media need to wake up and see Antifa for what they really are. Domestic terrorists. 
Thank you Mr president. God bless you.
Before sending your child off, make sure they have a firm foundation in values from God. Beware of the devil wearing a professors name.
What about this nuclear reactor, which is in the path of #HurricaneHarvery

The government isn't even staffed! How can you help any emergency?
Just say Good Luck. You're on your own.
Katrina lesson, don't trust local Dem. Dem LA gov & Dem NO mayor botched handling disaster. GOP MS gov flawless. Fake news blame GOP Bush43.
Save your prayers. Stop with the gutting of the #EPA and actually do your job by defending us against #pollution .

Give me a break! U couldn't careless about people and their lives!
Tweeting Harvey news to serve as a distraction from the chaotic and crumbling WH. Arpaio, Gorka, and your transgender ban are the real news.

Pruitt denies hurricanes exist 
Laughs at victims
Thank u mr trump! MAGA
Like there's  FEMA director. Please.
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of Joe Arpiao
No thoughts or prayers for the non-racist members of this country.
Yeah, cuz that helps...Faith without works is dead.
#DayLateDonnie
#TrumpResign
Thoughts and prayers with the US citizens who are in the way of a Trump storm. We are with you.
Stop trying to kill the EPA. Climate change is real. Don't believe me, ask the people of Texas.
And as long as I'm looking out the window, why not continue my assault on the environment?
A guy who's against science and wants to set us back a generation with all the work we've accomplished is sending "thoughts & prayers."

Thank you to all the first responders and people helping each other out. That's what we do as Americans. Here's one way you can help now. https://twitter.com/redcross/status/901546157238833152 …

Don't need your thoughts and prayers... seems this is the GOP go to line
oh, along with the crucial agencies the current rotten-to-the-core-from-top-to-bottom administration is gutting & trying to dismantle, them?
If there is any possible way you can harm victims, you'll find it. You gotta protect those oil rigs against Americans who love clean water.
So relieved that our government officials are sending "thoughts and prayers".

Policy trumps thoughts and prayers any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
So was all that crap about "acid rain" in the 80s real?  My parents bought a new car in 86 and were terrifed of acid rain.  Hoax?  Tell me.
Be safe, y'all, and remember: Grifter Don & Pathetic Pruitt only care about the oil wells & the refineries.

Thanks for getting ahead of and continuing to be proactive concerning the damage Harvey is doing and can do.
You should go down there and monitor it close-up and personal
Thoughts and prayers that all of the oil rigs in Texas don't topple over so I can continue to make more money*
Where's @realDonaldTrump's prayers he is a Christian, right?
Trump is Christian only when the evangelicals want him to be!  Fake Christian
THE WORST EPA CHIEF EVER!!
God help the environment and God help those of us who live in it
good thing funding was removed for flooding standards from infrastructure spending.  It won't rain again like this. standards, schmandards
Says guy that has made it his priority in life to pillage and ravage the planet. #RumblesPruittRapesPlanetEarth 
"Praying." Because it's almost as effective as "wishing it were so." Resign, you feckless Luddite.
They're going to need a hell of a lot more than that
Global warming in the flesh. Get your head out the sand

Trump "I will continue to be updated by my closest advisors, Alex Jones,James Woods,Scott Baio, & Richard B Spencer.Stay calm,& stay white".
tRump is the worst POTUS EVER and it's only been 7 months! RESIGN DISHONEST DON YOU SELF-CENTERED EGOMANIAC! It's MUELLER TIME!
I don't how people can do math.. it seems so impossible.. >n<"!! I just don't get it at all!!!
Why would we want YOU dealing with this? You'll probably deny it even happened. Can't wait until the lot of you are kicked out of your jobs.
God, are the refinerys and oil platforms ok?  I'm worried about my oil and gas stock, Scott!         AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
The #EPA THAT you gutted?
Good job

Washington Post gets it right! We bash the media a lot. Important to give them kudos for being truthful (for a change). 
I'm surprised this guy even believes in hurricanes.
Closely monitoring from the golf course?
Sorry. No tragedy here. Move on to issues
still denying climate change, bitch? Good thing you are praying, should help a lot
And literally fuelling the storms with your ignorant dismissal of science based climate change.. you utter fools.
Thought you fired all the EPA staff-  or at least gutted what was there ?
@SenSchumer
Oh did you appoint someone to oversee those areas?
You are working for a racist anti Semite but appreciated your concern about Harvey

Climate Change is a cruel master, Scott.
Gee whiz boys, you don't suppose the intensity just maybe be related to human-caused global warming? NAW! Cuz the Earth is FLAT!
We don't need "thoughts and prayers" we need a fully funded EPA, FEMA and NOAA. Human driven Climate Change is real, btw.
it is not human driven. Even if you knew for sure that it is not human driven you would not admit it because you are worried about your city
Thoughts and prayers do nothing you fraud.
The sentiment convinces his base he cares. Not much critical thinking happens after he mentions God and prayers.
Watching TV yet again...
