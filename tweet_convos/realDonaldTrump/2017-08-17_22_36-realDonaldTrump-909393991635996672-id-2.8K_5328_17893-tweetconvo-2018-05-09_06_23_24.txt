@IamSeerious They don't want to assimilate They want us 2 assimilate https://t.co/BxOW9b9gxr?ssr=true #assimilation
That's how they win, demand demand demand until they wear down their opponent. This just for starters
Look what Poland does! Muhammad not welcome! 
They have not had the terror attacks that the rest of Europe has had
Polish President: 'There is No Doubt the Growing Wave of Terrorism is Linked to Migration' http://bit.ly/2xq3eVN  
Are these the jobs you are bringing back to America? I stay tuned to see how you are going to start WWIII.
That kid frank who mowed ur lawn had bigger hands than you do. So sad.
I was just thinking about this the other day. I believe it ;)
@POTUA has done more for twitter than  ANY company and yet their stock keeps tanking and their leadership in turmoil. Explain that to me. 
twitter targets & suspends @POTUS supporters & Christians but lets isis & pedophiles do anything
lost 2 million subscribers this year
Any woman that voted for Trump is a certifiable nitwit.

Can you grow up and accept that he's president? If you let him, he can do great things.
Absolutely not. He is a shame and embarrassment to our country.
President Trump is the single greatest thing to ever happen to our country!! God has blessed us with a true American Patriot leader!#MAGA
Its easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.
You have been fooled by the racist Obama. So I see why you can't see it for the good Trump is
Please back up this opinion with facts.
#facts
That's cool because Obama still had the most liked tweet in history. Sorry Donnie.
Well that one analyst must have been smoking some good bud when he came up with that estimate
Really? You are so insecure you are measuring your twitter value. Good grief now I am starting to wonder about the size of your hands.
Insecure much?
True, everyone loves a good laugh at the absurd behaviour of those in #socalled power several times a day. Thanks .@POTUS for all the laughs
True. Trump was the only reason I started my @twitter account.
R u going to bully them 4 ur cut? Goodness knows ur actually broke. Can't even bail Jared out of his pathetic 666 deal.
Will they strip search ur grandkids when they're visiting daddy in prison?
This is a genius masterpiece! The dates aligning with such precision cannot just be a coincidence!!
I ordered it 2 days ago and cannot wait for it to arrive! Will rock it to work!!
 #Resist
Hahaha! Trump don't even have $2 billion himself!
I bet he took the donated 1 million out of his fake charity funds. He might not have 1mil in cash. That's why no show for his tax returns.
How much you want to bet? FYI, Hillary lost bigly!!! #MAGA
Yeah, Hillary lost by 65 million to Trumps 62 million.

How much I want to bet... How much are you good for?
Oops my bad. She must be president then by your calculations 
Nope, my calculations only involve imprisonment of Trump, Pence and Ryan. So you'll probably be looking at President Hatch.
Keep dreaming buddy! It is so much fun to enjoy the misery of you Hillary supporters. You concoct scandal after scandal yet Trump stands!
Me Hillary supporter? There's a lot of people on the right who did not buy the Trump bullshit. Oh, and Trump cooked up his scandals himself.
No different than "What is Kim Kardasian worth to tabloids?" Only a narcissist would be proud of that.
Fuck that watch matt c xx
Would be even bigger if he released Ivanka sex tape in a tweet.

call Kelly stat! @realDonaldTrump needs stronger meds & physical restraints this morning. How much more of this @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr ?
Really? Someone's bigly ego and TINY self esteem is showing again.
The value of Trump's tweets is incalculable as they show daily how spectacularly ignorant, inept, unstable, and amoral he is.  #UnfitToServe
#Markets Markets #StockMarket #Twitter #Resist #Racist  not according to the stock market… Twitter stock is tanking #TimeIsRunningOut
Maybe it's time to BOYCOTT till they ban him

Why  people keep bringing up Hilary.She is not president . racist trump is.The issue is trump is an idiot incapable of running his business

Hahahagahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Good one, Donnie! :D

@realDonaldTrump #FakeNews
You may be worth 2 billion to twitter, but you're not worth 2 cents to America. Get over yourself. You egotistic narcissist.
Please don't challenge us to a .gif-off when Trump-bashing is concerned. You will lose. :)
Game. On.

This is brilliant and accurate!! 
Still my fav...
Was just thinking about this. How many people joined Twitter solely because of President Trump? I wouldn't be here if not for him.
I don't follow him. Has he said anything noteworthy?
Anyone check Twitter Audit today? There are an inordinate amt. of bots today. Trump is desperate and it shows.
If trump was worth 1/10 of what he thinks he is, we would be wallowing in money! But alas, he is totally worthless, selfish & self serving!
Donald, are you threatening to quit Twitter?  Lol. Have you been reading comments and are befuddled? Go ahead. I could care less.
Trump doing what Obama can't do. Boost the economy
and families are suffering from hunger and poverty. What is happening to our beautiful world. #valueoflife
or less
I disagree. I think he is PRICELESS! Great President!
I wouldn’t be here but for Pres Trump.  How many are like me?
God is a great mathematician - He multiplies
You may have money value, but not much human value. Only one saves tour soul.
@realDonaldTrump  You're Welcome America!! 
Get your ass to church, Trump. You are in serious need of Jesus this morning.
So are you hater!! 
I'm not sharing tweets about assaulting women this morning.
Yep, that's what happens when you start dismantling a toxic politically correct society, so that it can be rebuilt with real values,Courage!
We need a new platform for conservatives; we'll take Trump with us. Twitter's gonna be finished, they have nothing without him
#DitchTwitter
Yea keep telling yourself that. Everytime his base says they will do something, 5 people show up.UR numbers mean nothing. Look at the polls.
The 2nd analyst said Trump is bankrupt and owes millions... No tax returns is proof.
@maddow shows us his tax return. Wow he paid so much !!!
The real question should be net value for society, of which I'd say you're a deficit to. You're not capable of actual leadership, #sitdown
Yeah. No like his money. It's all fake. Next time audit the account Bloomberg.

Thats why TW won't suspend him.They chose their $$ over their so-called 'liberal conscience'.Must b besties w/HRC. Trmp mks every1 $$$$$$$!
Kind of makes you wonder why he's only donating one million to the hurricane relief...maybe those billions are all tied up somehow?
He hasn't even donated it. All talk.
Enjoying the Emmys?
Well why don't you release your taxes and prove @markets right? Re tweeting an article ain't good enough Blotus McNoTax!
Regardless, Twitter stock is a bad investment.

Follow the money- must be why @Twitter won't revoke his account even when he tweets/RTs anti-Semitic/misogynistic/violence-inciting garbage
Funny how the liberal bias scum who run @Twitter walk around denying that Trump is worth anything to them.
You only measure worth in $$.  A hollow, empty person.  You won't buy your way out of the charges coming your way.

I'm proud to be an American
If you hate America, name a country you'd rather live in...then move there. Bye
#GodBlesstheUSA 
Egotistical maniac
I do think he saved twitter while he embarrassed many Americans. Most Rep have some ethics and class, he sadly has none.
https://twitter.com/the_force_1/status/909419308639547392 …
Anyone notice the article after the Twitter article? 
"Trump Is Ready to Sell Out His Base"  Obviously he does not read his RT.
Aint hate great #Twitter?
You're seriously retweeting this? Don't you have a job?
What he's worth to regular Americans ....nothing
Most of trump's followers on twitter aren't supporters, they/we are here to call the bigot on his sh_t!
 u Donald Trump
HOW MUCH DOES TRUMP OWE PUTIN, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE MOB? #MuellerIsComing AND HE'S GOING TO PUT YOU AWAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
This man sweats money!!!
Bot.
If Trump leaves Twitter, they're toast.
I don't believe this man's worth no to billion, otherwise he would not be having the RNC pay for his lawyer fees. He's a broke slob. Resign!
We DO know that he OWNS nothing but MILLIONS in debt to foreign banks!
I would guess if you quit, $twtr would do much better. It would give a louder voice to your critics.
Oh, the vanity

What the hell does that even mean? 
I am on Twitter ONLY for #MyPresident Trump. When he is gone, I am gone. #MAGA on Patriots!!!
Did Tramp aka DoNothingDonnie the con man, bigot, really retweet an article about him and twitter?
ALOT!!
This is what you focus on when you have a micropenis. #Sad
Raging elitist.
I see it's all about you again. You're for the people as long as it's for you first. Shameful. LIAR
And yet they have the audacity to block us from tweeting to our happy heart's desire... doesn't sound like good business sense to me...
Brag more, ya narcissist
@realDonaldTrump you are a walking dick
Today the world learned what Melania has known all along: Donald Trump IS NOT the Rocket Man.
yes they all like to say they arn't big fans, but they are getting rich on your dime. Sat nite live and Cobeart too. send a bill.
It always has to be about you.  Such an insecure man child
Easy there tibny hands, next step will be buying an extremely large pickup truck to compensate.
What are you worth to the US. Negative infinity.
@realDonaldTrump can destroy @twitter by just dumping it and open @getongab account.

Wow. Someone's ego needs stroking, eh?
Dude, it's not because the ppl love you, it's because they can't stand you.
Who cares-
It's like watching your friend fall for a narcissist who is going to destroy her life, only your friend is 1/3 of the country. #dumptrump
Well now. THAT explains why @Twitter REFUSES to remove his account NO. MATTER. WHAT. HE. TWEETS.
does the D and S Manual have a name for what you have?
@realDonaldTrump who th hell cares?  You are a raving lunatic.
And that's just from the Russians!

Is that why @twitter didn't close your acct when you threatened N. Korea w/nuclear violence, in clear violation of their Terms & Conditions?
Really?  You will release a speculative article but not your Tax Returns? Pfft..
Everyone knows it's about the ALMIGHTY DOLLAR; otherwise, they would've closed your account for your obvious racism and sexism.

I don't care. 
How is he going to help? #preexistingcondition 
#saveACA
one analyst out of millions and of course idiot Trump has to support him lmfao

Seriously @bloomberg, what's the $$ value of a POTUS RT'ng a #TrumpTroll named FUCTUPMIND that shows @HillaryClinton being hurt w/golf ball?
You re tweet this crap for your ego?
He is worth a lot of laughs ...at, not with
Who cares.  You need to be worried about the middle class and the poor.

Since @realDonaldTrump is worth about 2 billion to Twitter maybe he could exert a little pressure to make them behave more fairly?
Your great shame is the amnesty you're giving.
Prove it. Release your tax returns. I don't believe you paid all taxes you should have and are hiding something. #TaxersPayersRights
Wow. It turns out Trump is good for something. Just not his job.
What a sad @POTUS. Nothing but big losses in DC, so he searches for a "win" depending on people telling him to fuck off.
So now we know why he gets away with violence and lies and bullshit.  All for money.  Shame!!
I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!! I love ME!!
This story is a month old. 
No one gives a shit. 
You're mad #MAGA is burning your hats. 
Your base is dwindling each week.
Only if you count all those charitable donations that were used as a tRump family piggy bank. Illegally. Trump family = organized crime!

Bullshit, trolls and fake accounts don't yield anything to advertisersg
He's making a fortune off the govt and my tax dollars #emoluments
FAKE NEWS!!!!
Other analysts estimate a couple of million
Is there a bigger narcissist? I don't think so. You're an embarrassment! #Resist, #fakepresident
Yeah, stay on twitter, we love attacking your idiocy every single day
I think Congress would approve a $2 billion payment if it meant he President could be banned from Twitter
#Trump plays out of #RussiaGate. SAD!  #DomesticTerrorists #FakeNews #Kompromat #ActiveMeasures #OnwardTogether http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-retweets-gif-hitting-golf-ball-hillary-clinton-twitter-spree-2017-9 …
So I guess all of my "report this person" attempts will be ignored diligently. lOl
#NotMyPresident #whatajoke #nightmare #whereisthehumanity
Wow nice retweet me president 
Aug. 17 news. Bored? Today is Sept. 17.
I gotta call bullshit on this.
#maga
Whatever makes you feel important - fake news.

Delete trumps Facebook and Twitter accounts
One thing money can't buy
Who Cares. Really. Who in the hell in this World cares about your "worth" to twitter.  Except you.
Just WINNING

HOMEBOY IS SO DANG PROUD OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
This tweet? Again, thank you! Added to your own list of why you need to be 25th Amended.
worth = low US reputation
I think he's worth nothing that's why he hides his tax returns. @realDonaldTrump
What is Trump worth to our country? Absolutely nothing but embarrassment. #NotMyPresident
Only a sad, fragile little man-boy ego would retweet this — as @POTUS. How presidential...  #25thAmendment #MuellerIsComing #Resign
Hitlery? Seriously after Trumplethinskin took up do Nazis...ABNORMALS all think alike
Donny, didn't your parents teach you that it is ugly to flaunt how much money you have, especially when it is a lie. Stop it.
If @realDonaldTrump quits his twitter account, you can flush  to the shitter.

Worth every ounce what @jack & @biz would also agree that narrative has metamorphed from compassion to correction from Inequality to balance
Don't say that out loud or Potus is gonna want his cut
Do you know the current exchange rate for $-to-ruble transactions?
Shut the front door! My gosh the ego of some people
Why retweet this about yourself… Couldn't you just I don't know maybe… Show us your tax returns? LOL
I would not even have twitter installed on my phone if it wasn't for the prez
You are all about money and nothing else...
