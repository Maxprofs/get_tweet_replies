As we are currently dealing with N Korea, I remember when Trump stated during the campaign that every country should have nuclear weapons.

Любой эсминец США сразу собьет на Земле ракету КНДР-когда топливо будет полностью залито.США надо успокоится.
Россия не будет без причины пускать ракеты,а у США ракет нет,кроме крылатых,которые не эффективны.
заменить ракетный двигатель на новый,что невозможно на 450-ти Минетмен-3 в шахтах.

it doesn't bother you that institutions that allegedly report the truth actually publish lies and falsehoods?
Trump lies all the time and you're a sucker if you think the NYT is lying because Trump said so.
You can directly quote Trump in his latest book as saying Iran should not have nuclear weapons.NYT - Telepaths?
He contradicts himself. You can also find him suggesting it would be better for some to have nukes.
yes you did say that I heard it directly from ur lying mouth. I am sure NYtimes have it on tape.
you did though... it's on tape....?
but you did say this? #Dementia ?
Ummm.. yeah you did... memory failing already??

Yes, you did. We have the tapes.

Aside from lying about you, the NYTimes writers don't think as subtly as you.
#libetaralmedia  liberal media bias strong and growing
Donald, out of your mouth, saw you say that Japan and Saudi Arabia should have nukes.  Followed with "Why not"?
You did.  Stop lying.
I heard you with my own ears.  You said it.  Maybe your memory is going...

Except there are numerous interviews with you on tape saying exactly that.... Libya, Korea, Japan. Etc.

#Trump this is why I do not listen to the #MSM. They are #CORRUPT.
Trump said "Now, wouldn't you rather...have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"
NYT never gets anything right. You're a living testimony to that. Forget them, lets jump start this economy.
Trump: *spouts insipid bullshit*
Media: *reports & links to video proof*
Trump: "I never said that!"

#LIARTRUMP
yes very unreliable what a filthy gossip rag
They're still in business? MSM should report truthfully otherwise they're just instigators. †
