Why is Ronny out?
NO NO. You will enforce the new laws for TERM LIMITS..
Wow!!! I actually agree with you but have you asked Mitch McConnell his opinion?  He wasn't real enthusiastic about this right after you were elected.
You are truly a great American president trump!
Freshman Year has been matched to this tweet by a #DeepLearning model


Best thing I've seen today. 
My prayer is that there will be a less than one-term limit for you, once Robert Mueller completes his investigation.

#DrainTheOvalOfficeSwamp
Most americans do not feel "strongly" about you, at all! @ShafPatel
Most Americans think you should get out of the White House IMMEDIATELY!
Most Americans do not want a total lunatic to run their (once great) country!
As an American that supports the Best President EVER 100% I think you should not use the term "most Americans" you can whine and cry all you want... which you do everyday, but 7 MORE YEARS
#KAG #Trump2020 
He will never last 7 years lol  Tick... Tick... Tick
I'll take that bet, he's coming apart mentally, Mueller has him six ways from Sunday, and WE OUTNUMBER YOU.
Are you coming with forks or safety pins? Are you threatening? I think it sounds like a threat. He is absolutely not coming apart he's getting better every day!
Best President EVER 
You are the swamp, dotard.

I recently had some terrific meetin' wid some bipartisan group uh freshman lawmakers who feel real strongly in favo' uh Congressional term limits. ah' gave dem mah' full suppo't and endo'sement fo' deir effo'ts. #DrainTheSwamp
love ur logo:)!

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON FIRE 

He’s calling out #DeepState, #Comey and the LIES of the LEFT!…
#GetWOKE #GreatAwakening #USA
There’s an IDEOLOGICAL CIVIL WAR happening [in the black community] about people who are focused on their PAST & shouting about SLAVERY & people who are focused on their FUTURES.…
#ObamaGate #MAGA
Most Americans feel strongly that you release your taxes
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Good Afternoon! Term limits are a "Great" idea. Great job with your #JointPessConference at the @WhiteHouse today. Prayers you, Baron, and your family have a wonderful and safe evening...God bless! #USA 
#MakeAmerocaAgain

We the people give our FULL support and endorsement for Mueller to taken you down and for the Democrat's to IMPEACH you! You Russian sell out TRAITOR! 
Tic toc tic toc tic toc...
There must be term limits!!! No exception!! The Ores is only allowed to serve 8 yrs..time to cleanse congress,,,
You keep filling the swamp. It’s obviously not about draining the swamp, it’s about filling with monsters who are loyal to you and you only.
I will never vote for another Republican in my entire life because of Trump & the creeps that enabled him...
In no way does Trump represent all of the republican party
No but unfortunately no one in that party will stand up to him. That makes it worse. Evil triumphs when good men and women do nothing.
There are republicans who stand up to Donald Trump... congress is based on a voting system
Not when they toe the party line
This from the guy who suggested that "President for life" sounded like a great idea.
Fabulous!
One can only dream.  The occasional fire is good for the forest as it clears out a lot of the underbrush.. Its not drain the swamp, it should be slash and burn. # MAGA
TERM LIMITS PLEASE!!!
Dems love SUCKING the government dry.
They just love sucking on whatever they can get their mouths on.


You ROCK!!   #TermLimits
Term limits have done nothing to stop corruption. It merely gives the corrupt a timeframe.  
If you think it helps, you are exactly how #johnkelly described you.
#WrongAgain #MangoMussolini #IdiotInChief
Long overdue. We would have less corrupt millionaires for one tho g
Current: Partly cloudy with scattered tweets; 7% chance Donald Trump wrote this himself.

This is tweet number 140 mentioning Congress from @realdonaldtrump -- 64 since inauguration.


The only one with term limits is you: you'll be out of office within a year!
Why YOU want @HillaryClinton in? The most corrupt in the land

Dream on baby cake
Baby cake? Your photo proves your a fossil. No need to speak.
I earned my right to speak, baby cake !  Your diaper needs changing
That’s all you have, it’s getting old.  Seems like a repetitive come back, next
Imagine that's the worst thing they could come up worth on Trump. 
Yeah considering Bill violated the Oval Office .  But the diaper baby probably doesn’t remember that.
Mr. President whether you can't stop saying Terrific just after few words every time

Presidential term limits should have a tryout period. Don’t pass probation, you’re out.
for Trump he failed within 30 minutes.
Oh hell, he failed the second he announced he was running.
Putin’s monkey’s monkey 
Putin’s monkey 

I agree, can we limit your term to the end of this week?
For a professor, your pretty stupid
Agree. Keep trying to drain. Might take a while
The lobbyists will then always have an advantage over the legistrators. They will be entrenched.
Yes Sir !!! Keep your word on that promise and that will really help to drain the swap !!!
This is the only way we can ever drain the swamp....put it on the ballot please!!!  Time to turn Washington around!
Yes!!"Make America Great Again"Go Trump
Yes, #DrainTheSwamp, #TermLimitsForCongress, Senators 12 years, Congresscritters 8 years all with a 4 year gap for a Congresscritter to run for Senator and a Senator to run for the House. #MAGA
If the intention is to drain the swamp, we would have to make a clean sweep of your entire administration.  I’m up for that....you?
Yep you and your family
When are Trump and his clack going to ditch that hollow, completely phony 'Drain the Swamp' motto?  I think even an 85 IQ dolt realizes that motto is now about as meaningless as if John Bolton used it.
Russia.
Oh look it's another Scott dworkin disciple, you people really aren't right in the head
Right on. Even the Daily Kos hates this fraud.
Glad someone sees the light
All these guys have multitudes of sock puppet accounts that "like" and retweet their posts. It gives the illusion of numbers of supporters and like-minded people, but that's all it is - illusion.
Oh I know I did test on this back in the day by putting them all on lists and watching how they cross connect through all the accounts that were on Donald Trump's Twitter line, it was pretty funny when I expose them for it
You should see how many sock accounts there are that have like 6 or 11 followers but are followed by at least one and often both of the Krassensteins.
I tell you one that's funny to follow and easy to expose is the Scott dworkin disciples
So if it’s drained won’t you go down the drain too?
We the DEPLORABLE ONES love this move.  TERM LIMITS God Bless You Mr. President.
GREAT MR PRESIDENT TRUMP!  THE BEST PRESIDENT IN OUR COUNTRY, WE HAD GREAT ONES AROUND SECOND WORLD WAR TWO, & PRESIDENT REAGAN, HE WAS A GREAT ONE!!!  BUT LIKE MR PRESIDENT TRUMP...
HE IS VERY UNIQUE, A BRAVE & GREAT MAN. VERY INTELLIGENT!!!
Amen, @POTUS!!
It ought to be tougher to be a career politician!!!  ?
One & Done !!!
What they wanted to say is get out of office because the swamp has been made worse.
Awesome! Let’s go Congress get off your butts and pass this. #1 priority #TermLimitsCongress @RandPaul @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @senchuckschumer @RepPeteOlson @NancyPelosi @POTUS @FoxNews @SpeakerRyan @VP @CNN @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenFeinstein
Exactly so we don’t get stuck w MCCains and McConnells
McDonalds suffices 
Term limits for every FedGov position. From the Cabinet Directors on down to the janitors. Every one! 10 years tops as a FedGov worker/servant and then no more.
Cabinet yes, house and senate..yes, janitors? Really. You know the military is part of the federal government. Should they only do 10 years also? Asking for a friend.
How many more Lois Lerner’s or Peter Strzok’s do you want in position to do the things they have done? Term limits across the board.
Here is the problem I spent lot of money to educate myself for DHS job. It will take me more than 10 years to pay it off. I am not a director, supervisor, just a janitor. You are being overly castigating. Yes terms for cabinet level. The bad agents wouldn't make it under new mgt.
Is a government job the only way to pay it off? Could you do FedGov for 10 years and then private sector after that?
I agree with term limits though. Men like Comey and Mueller have been around to long. Never mind Waters, Finestien and McCain
We need term limits, but we need also to watch who runs. They can run someone who shall do the bidding of the money people. We need to stay on our toes and keep God's commandments. Sneaks are sneaks and thief's are thief's. Even Christ had a cheater in His group.
I Love this cowboy. USA really  needs you super Hero . Iranian People Loves you 
Term limits are a terrible idea. If my District has a good Congress member, I want the right to keep him in office for as many terms as he or she deserves.
Cool, time for old fogies like McConnell to go who have been in congress for more than 30 years. Time to replace him with blue.
I’m afraid to agree with him...like it’s a trick.
He only believes this if it works out in his favor, if he can get rid of Schumer and Pelosi, but would somehow want to bend the rules to be able to keep his buddies like McConnell.
I just hope we survive this guy. He’s really trying to bring down the entire system.
We will survive, the question is how long will it take to fix the mess he's creating. For me the only silver linings in all of this are 1- it should be the death of the republican party and 2- nobody can say from here on out that racism doesn't exist, Trump has proven it does.
Agreed...now how good are those cupcakes?
Cupcakes fix everything.
Red Velvet?
Your swamp
So you're telling me that Donald Trump started making this swamp over the last four decades? You're ridiculous
He's made it swampier!
Swampier ? After Obama that was impossible
Whatever you say TDAWG. An observation, you capitalized every letter, we think a lot of ourself don't we?
As a matter of fact I do I do more in an hour than you do all day
How do you know that? Do yo know what I do, what I think the. I've had a great career! I'm retired now but I work part time, volunteer a lot, sit on 2 boards, act as treasurer on another. You're out of your league with me seadog. Oops
Well kudos to you at least you're not being a lazy retiree you're actually doing something with your time. And don't call me Sea dog I'm not a Navy squid
This is the only thing you've said while president that i agree with.
That’s cuz you vote liberal
No, it's because i vote sane and informed.
Liberalism is a mental defect in my opinion
Dear President Trump..you understand the human nature better than everyone else...your allies around the world will be loyal to you only if you favor them with something they can never forget..you have to be Funding Father to your foreign allies ...
In fact, let’s have the president serve 1 year, starting now.  Subject to change in the future.
#orangejustice please, #VoteBlue #Demforce #resistsister
term limits!!! yeah! two terms and done! That will (hopefully) do away with legislators who are basically the puppets of lobbyists!
Term limits would be a great start to getting our government on the same page - two 6 year terms and then done.
Best thing you could ever do. #Ronpaulhasbeensayingitforyears
トラ様
your big entrepreneur allies..they will be loyal to you if you can protect their interests especially in foreign countries ...one of your phone call can solve a crisis for them or lower the trade barrier ...all your supporters the ordinary people they need you in their daily life
They also think they can actually accomplish something....freshman.
Honey you are the swamp. Go drain yourself out of DC.
Well if you do that all of your supporters will be gone...oh wait they're already jumping your sinking ship.  Someone want to reply with how many Republicans have resigned or said this was their last term?
Omg! I think we really are headed in the Right direction. Government was NOT suppose to be a full time job. All special interests step on Americans toes and told us lies for many many many years. The madness needs to Stop 
Great! I say we limit @mattgaetz term in both houses of Congress to 2 years,  so let's vote him out in November, and then also limit his role in policymaking anywhere and everywhere. 
Well, he might do well protecting animals. Real animals. Not people he'd like to call animals.
I can back this
Yes term for all.  Eight years just like the presidency that’s the most.
YOU are the swamp! #WorstPresidentEver #ImpeachTrumpNow #MuellerTime #FakeTaxCut
I http://would.love  to see term limit in all states too
It will never work. The ones who want to put term limits on are the ones that have to pass legislation on it. Not to mention you were supposed to executive order it right off the bat when you were elected
Something I actually agree with. However, it would've been cool if that had happened when appointing cabinet members and staff in general.

A bank that had been under federal investigation until last year has played a role in two recent real estate transactions involving Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner’s family company. https://www.propublica.org/article/bank-of-internet-kushner-deals …
Mr. President, 

If Congress won't take a vote on term limits, is it possible to get it on a National ballot and let the American people decide?

Thank you and God Bless you.

#DrainTheSwamp
Bipartisan - as in Republican and Tea Party Republican.
Please! USA needs this.
Holy shit... I agree with you!
Nobody cares except your supporters.
We have term limits, they're called elections.  Any time we want people out of office we can vote them out.  Or we can call for their impeachment, please.
TERM LIMITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I support indicting you
Impeachment will limit YOUR “presidential” term. #illegitimate #3million #resist #impeach
Don't forget heil Mueller. Look  at his team.
Drain trump
They should not be "entitled" to a lifetime pension however!! They should return to the private sector and WORK like anyone else would after only 4 or six years of "service"!!
Would It Entail Job Assessments Near The End Of A Term To See If The Party Is Effective And Can Continue?
If we get term limits for Congress, I don't ever need anything else for Christmas. Ever.

Drain the swamp. Term limits
#DrainTheSwampWorldWide
Did you put Secret Service on Kathy Griffith for making fun of you?
Did you vote liberal liberal?
Term limits, really... while your in a SANE moment why dont you address the archaic application of the ELECTORAL COLLEGE vs THE DEMOCRATIC POPULAR VOTE
Because you can't trust a mob to do the right thing.
If you want to truly #DrainTheSwamp Comrade Spanky, might I suggest you impeach yourself and open independent investigations into your family members ...that in itself will eliminate the stench of the American Swamp persona. Half the battle is realizing #YouAreTheSwamp
#maga
TERM LIMITS FOR BUREAUCRATS ALSO.
President Trump. I was hacked today by FB.  Indonesia.  Spent my whole day explaining.  What are you doing about Mark Zuckerberg’s explanation that he is protecting is.  He is not.
You realize we know when you did not tweet something yourself:

-no all all caps
-no name calling
-grammatically correct
I could care less if he's grammatically correct or spews frustation.. He's been attacked since day one, but he's MAGA..Obama was groomed for yrs.. The only thing he did for America was divide, & embarass
You're part of the swamp
Totally agree.  Some of these politicians think this government is his/her personal company.  They misuse our tax dollars without any regard for our rights.  They are paid a salary.
Sooo???
Strike while the iron is hot!  If they get a second term, they won't be nearly as likely to support term limits......frogs in a boiling pot!
A policy that crosses the political divide. But then you do talk a lot of rubbish and you will always have Obama and Hillary to blame when you don't achieve it. But and it is a very large but, if you DID it would be a revolution to American politics 
Yes! Definitely needed!
You keep saying “Drain the Swamp”, but you (and your Administration,) turned the swamp into a freaking Quicksand Pit.
Yes, yes and yes. They start like lambs and turn crocodiles after. Limit the term so the younger ones of all races  can also serve their country. It's not an exclusivity. It should be like jury duty but extended. After that, go back to your business.

Term limits is the ONLY way to go. Our gov was supposed to be made up of businessmen & statesmen, not career politicians. Making politics ur career defeats the purpose of having a republic w/3 branches of gov. Might as well have a monarchy.
Yah. Term limits has always been a great idea. Only one problem: the very people who can intact it are the ones who won't, because it limits their "career" ambitions. 

Only possible way we'd ever get this pushed through is to only elect people who promise to support term limits.
Drain the swamp then
How does she win?
Call me when you get Patti Murray and Maria Cantwell out of there...
HOW much did you offer them?
Looking for a new attorney are ya 
Did you fire Pruitt yet?  Carson? Until you do nobody can take you seriously about draining the swamp.
Drain the swamp!! Thank you Mr. Preisident!

As long as there are no term limits in #GauntanamoBay? Asking for some #Deplorables
With all due respect you have lied,  you stated you would not allow these illegals in our country yet here they come.  Are you just another politician telling us what we want to hear then doing the opposite? That's certainly  how it seems.
Probably one of the most important things you could accomplish imho.  These career politicians lose touch with everyday Americans and we get what we have today.  People “representing” us that have zero clue what Americans are dealing with.
You're more worried about fake news in the people in Flint Michigan 
You should be tweeting BHO regarding Flint.

@realDonaldTrump.    “I’m like,smart.” 
Drain the lobbyist from your administration.   That is the swamp
We need Term Limits so more legislative items can get passed in the House and Senate such as Infrastructure, Immigration, THE WALL, and other important things for us Americans!!
What the hell is going on at the border, Mr. President? Where is thr National Guard? Why is the Caravan being allowed in? This is a crisis.  We need action.
And presidential limits too , right?
But you are the swamp
U belong in jail!.
You should fire the AG and assistant AG they are doing you wrong, it’s like a bandage on a wound just pull it off, sure it will sting for a day or two but it will start to heal
Like your support is a defining factor NOT
Tão odiado,  com  tantos seguidores.
Build a wall.
Absolutely
Haha. Sure you did. What is wrong with you? @realDonaldTrump #whatiswrongwithhim
Term limits don’t work. Look at California
When you give your "full support and endorsement" it's not saying much.
Until someone takes you aside and tells you not to, then you don’t. Right Donny? We’ve all been through this with you before.
Yes, I believe it solves so much good ole boy status quo. We need change. And fresh young ideas.
You have a sewer not a swamp

I am speechless of @MBuhari hypocrite, standing in front of @WhiteHouse with @realDonaldTrump talking on #HumanRights. Freedom & the rule of law his violating, must be respected
…
Remember effective Term Limits mean the Congressional Staff & Lobbyists are also Term Limited! You can't just limit the elected & expect all to change #DrainTheSwamp #DeepStateExposed
Many people are saying that your term as president has already far exceeded all rational limits.

But then, you’ve always been a loser.

#TimeToResign
Really ! Will this change tomorrow
How about a mental stability test for anyone running for office, any office?
Oh please. This is the same man who thought the idea of a presidency for life was something to consider. @Scotttaylorva
Another lie.
It’s not up to you or the freshman.  It’s up to the American people.  Or in your case, the Russians.
Considering your administration’s record you should be  banned from using #drainthe swamp
YES!! TERM LIMITS ARE A MUST!!
Strumpf you're treading a thin line
How is imposing term limits on career politicians “treading a thin line”? You’re literally too stupid to insult.
Congressional terms are needed INDEED !!!!
Dictator
^ Uninformed shill
That is not going to happen

Who cares. Why don’t you do some work for a change rather than jerking off on Twitter incessantly.
Because you vote liberal?
What?? We agree on something?
then all those citizens need to do is to join You under the name of "drain the swamp" or "MAGA" ..you will know their needs using supercomputers and big data ...because with good technologies nobody will be neglected..you will know all the people around the country wanting
Long time overdue the introduction of Congresssional and Senate term limits.  Good luck pushing this necessary agenda.

"Drain the Swamp" starts with you and most of your cabinet.
The only way the Swamp will be drained is if you go down with it! And you will!
Notice THEY'RE making the efforts, not YOU.
Term limits benefit lobbyists.  Do we really need a Constitutional amendment for that?
And your term limit is about to be cut short.  The shorter the better.  Then we can get back to being a great, respected country again!
Digging your and the GOP's own grave, good!
Please keep pushing this.  This will truly #maga
Finally. Something logical.
Trump is the greatest of all time.   Legendary skills. I hope and pray for a full 8 years presidency.
Russian Troll
