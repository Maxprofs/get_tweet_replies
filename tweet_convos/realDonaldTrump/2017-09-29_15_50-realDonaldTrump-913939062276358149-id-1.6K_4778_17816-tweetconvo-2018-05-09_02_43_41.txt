The ones who use 'liberal' programs the most are the red states
Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana in particular.
Alabama is mostly owned by the Gov. That's why they get a lot of fed money. MS and LA are majority what race?
1. Those states have lowest education levels, lowest tax base, no productivity so few jobs and those jobs pay below national average
And then come the FACTS and bit you!
We're optimistic about #Mueller...

Look who is back from golfing. 
Obama?
The tax reform that makes you grifters even richer? Fat chance!
With Obama gone, and someone with real-world business and job-creating experience in charge, it's small wonder Americans are confident again
President Trump wants to restore America and Obama wanted to destroy it. We have to be aware the Dems still want to bring America down.
No doubt, but we now have someone who isn't afraid to fight back, who counterpunches 10 times harder. That's what drives the left bananas.
I really enjoy watching Trump drive the crazy lefties nuts. Trump stands up and Obama coward down. What a difference a election makes.
So true.
Here is some more truth for you.

"Your @FoxNews poll, your YUGELY LOSING, just saying!U see this guy here? He's won not once but twice! You'll be lucky to make it 1/4th way
Liar, liar, pants on fire!
.@realDonaldTrump this is what putin told you to retweet/do as the crisis in Puerto Rico worsens? He really doesn't like you does he? #dotus
Like, for the past 8 years someone worked to actually make America great again after a recession.
Lol. This headline is a joke.

@realDonaldTrump   For God sake, stop this and watch Rachel Maddow right now!
Why she is a waste of good time....

My other fave Trump graphic is the "Twitler" one, with him dressed as Hitler.

Ser productivos

Be competitive

Be a global economy
The Donald wrote the book on the art of cheating on your taxes
Never cheated. and I don't know one person that doesn't use every means necessary. To save money if you say you don't your a damn liar.
What businesses were surveyed? How many were surveyed?
So half the manufacturers are being honest and saying they WON'T give their employees wage & benefit increases. And the other half are lying
@realDonaldTrump there should be no tax plan crafted until Trump released his!!!!
All bullshit from right wing trash.
You’re riding Obama’s success. You know that, right? You’ve done nothing substantial.
Great plan #MAGA GOD BLESS AMERICA PRESIDENT TRUMP #PERSIST JUSTICE FOR AMERICA LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ORDER 
Only the wealthy are optimistic!
Manufacturer optimism, not worker. Notice that? They'll keep shipping jobs overseas will continue yuuuugely under DOTUS.
How can you talk about manufacturing in the US when you and Ivanka have your businesses over seas
Puerto Rico should be your only main priority right now
TRUMP GETTING HIGH AGAIN!!
Trump inherited a growing economy, but with weak financial controls another 2008 type crash could happen any time.
Wow you found a new way to lie about stats!
I'd be optimistic too if I were a billionaire.
You need a phone monitor, instead of Secret Service, wasting our money

Trump is vacationing at his New Jersey Country club while thousands of #Americans in #PuertoRico are literally struggling for mere #Survival!

Trump's version of #TaxReform is a #TrumpTaxScam that will put hundreds of millions of hardworking Americans' savings right into his pocket.
They don't have a concrete plan. Lyin' Paul Ryan keeps saying there hasn't been major #TaxReform since '86, so they've had 31 years to plan!
We  our President who's restoring progress, respect and pride to this great country and its people
I remember three recessions after three previous Repub tax cuts.. ahhh good times
You all couldn't tell the truth if you tried.
Most of you would rather hear lies
Hear lies? No, we don't watch Fox "news"
Are you prone to delusions? Because it’s a fact that CNN, etc are so biased it’s basically lies while Fox only reports facts. Seek help ASAP
Which is very easy to do, apparently
You really need more education or better education your vocabulary shows your intelligence.
I’m in the process of receiving my Master’s in Financial Engineering from Univ. of TX...but keep up those Lib talking points...smh
Another loss for the "president." He couldn't cobble together a win at Monopoly!  #sad #illegitimatepresident
If true,  it's because your plan allows rich corporations to profit off the blood of the poor and middle class. America must be rid of you!
Brought to you buy a think tank bought and paid for by those to get the lion share of the the tax cut...propaganda.

That is for Aetna bronze plan. Not silver gold or platinum. 12k copay 6k deductables 36k per year is cost. Since ACA,what a job killer.
It's destroying this country I don't wish ill to anyone but it's time for John to go.
Oh I agree,worse thing is all new hires are wage payroll under 27.5 hours per week. No benefits! ACA job killer!
I see it every day my daughter full time job never 40 they don't have to pay benefits that's how stupid obama and dems are.
Already after a few days. How can you possible know?
Of course it did the Rich get Richer and the poor pay for it. This is not reform its just history repeating itself over and over again
The GOP Budget is an act of Passive Genocide against the disabled & elderly. You LIED & will be EXPOSED Donald. #ChristianFraud

Are you serious? What planet are you on? Trump is a disaster, totally unfit and incompetent. His own staff can't believe how little he knows
YA HE GETS RICHER OFF US THE WORKING PEOPLE AND HE AND RICHER GET RICHER BECAUSE HIS TAX B.S. EFFECTS US NOT THEM AT ALL....COMES FROM US

Not at GE in Schenectady, NY. Layoffs coming
Who buys GE ANYMORE ANYHOW.
We make generators and turbines for power plants you fool. We dominate the global market in it.
Layoffs = behind the times. Old technology. Old thinking.
Who do you think makes the jet engines for Boeing. You really are a fool.
GE is not a big player. Layoffs equate to that.
But yeah, not a "big player."  Go take a nap kid.
GE. Boring company. = layoffs. Quit living in the past

Ask our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico if they care about this right now. Yeah. Neither do I. Puerto Rico. Now.
This is going to be great!!! Corporations won't pay hardly any taxes and Republicans can blame all the debt on the next Democratic president
How long has manufacturer optimism been a thing?
Savings go to highest-incomes.Federal debt would rise  $3.0trillion over the first decadeand by at least$6.6trillion next 10yrs-bad
AMERICA HATES YOU!!! LOL.
Of course, the middle/low class are fucked!
Of course it is but does this mean the Trump's will begin having their products made back in the US. I am guessing no! Revealed not passed!

Puerto Rico.
Go to bed.  You aren't doing any good awake!

@realDonaldTrump  You mean optimism in China where 45 and #Ivanka have their businesses? 
#Trump
I think that was supposed to say "manufactered".
Just because you say it doesn't mean it's true.
Your tax plan has no details. And when you fail to get it passed just like all your other legislative failures that optimism will disappear.
Swamp news.
Mmmh....  Rico @ http://kiliedutravel.com/packages.html 
you are so far from the truth...why spread all these lies to the American people? Not buying this shit...nope!!
15% flat tax across the board on all income (capital gains and estates).  No deductions.  That's fair - anything else is BS.
Great news. Read
IDIOT
Screw your optimism.  I'm not buying anything.  Contributing to chefs in PR all year & living w what we have...
People need to do their homework. Do a fact check/media bias check on the Free Beacon. Known to post fake stories.
Dan, how do you think the fact that Donny is a corrupt thief factors into this "optimism"?

People are dying. Puerto Rico is no longer a humanitarian crisis but more like a genocide. #HuracanMaria #PUERTO_RICO
Stop trying to make "manufacturing optimism happen, it's not going to fucking happen nor is it even a real thing #FakeOptimisim
Oh Bullshit. The greedy will just get more greedy. It will not trickle down to more jobs or better wages or more training.
U r pd to spin @realDonaldTrump propaganda. Tweeting for a paycheck.
Ignorant ppl complain about this because they think it only benefits Trump. Jobs benefit ppl. Why is this such a hard concept to grasp?
Yeah. Tax breaks for rich & big businesses. Real US citizens get screwed
Survey data collected over last 3 quarters, not in reaction to your tac gimmicks.
they get to bring back offshored billions in taxes for pennies on the dollar, why not be happy? meanwhile everyone else gets their ss cut
Nice try tiny hands. The puerto ricans are calling you out on live tv. And we’re watching. Youre inept. #genocide

Well no one is optimistic that you & Ivanka will practice what you preach & bring your mfg to America to employ Americans!!¡!
Ha National associations of manufacturers?  Can you pay your cronie CEO's any more to write a better Report?  #MAGA
If you want middle class Tax Cuts why repeal estate tax, lower corp tax to 20%, and lower highest tax bracket to 35%?
P.S. That means YOU DON'T HIRE AMERICANS!
