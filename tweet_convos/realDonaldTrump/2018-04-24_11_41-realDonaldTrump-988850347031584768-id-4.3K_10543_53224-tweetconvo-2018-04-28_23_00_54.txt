I remember a time that French Fries had their name changed to Freedom Fries. The relationship seemed pretty flappable then.
I remember when all off France had both their arms high in the air saying "we surrender" when Germany came in...then the Americans saved them.
I understand that American made movies generally only show the D-Day landings from the American forces perspective, but my history books claim that France was saved by Western Allied Forces.
Bull shit... Americans saved them.
The only bull shit here is your Twitter intro that claims that you are a truth and facts kind of person.
Trump is not trustworthy. Period !  Our countries will always be allies, but Trump will put a knife in anyone's back. Trump is on his way out of our white house. He's a complete embarrassment and has been enabled by our Republican Congress to undermine our Constitution.
Nuts O!
Not true trump you will find someway to break up the US-France Relationship
The Americans have more interest with same faith values.
Freedom Fries?
Hope Macron’s right arm withstands today’s repeated assaults!
Hey we are strong with France but remember your faith, its Jewish, muslims are not what America stands for.
#basta
Be your decision for the climate a part of the unbreakable......... I am confident you'll keep it that way, President.
Too bad he doesn’t have the same relationship with the American people.
He is the Traitor& Chief. We will have him charged and incarcerate for treason, collusion, terrorism and other felonies that he's committed.
What else has Iranians have to offer, let me see terrorism, I would stand with Israel.
Oil is a commodity,  we can survive without it, history has proved it possible.
The American people fought hard for freedom Iranian rule is not freedom.
-

Whis history is that? The one I am reading here, is saying that the 45th was an impostor and was thrown in Jail...
Be nice. You would have that kind of relationship with everyone else the same. Jeez.
Macron is a perv like Anthony Weiner just the opposite way
France needs to get out of the business of facilitating its own invasion

REMEMBER When
BS Donnie Promised
To IMPLEMENT Russian Sanctions
Disclose his Personal Income Taxes
Grow Balls & Back up his Rhetorical BS Under Oath?
Negative thoughts about your President of your America is emotional garbage. Throw it away and find the positive right side.
i am still waiting for that ONE thing.....
I hope you don’t insult them and embarrass us like you a million times.  The sooner your in prison the better!
Careful. By your grammar, your lack of intelligence is showing.
Is “careful “ a sentence, just asking.
The "be" is implied. Had I actually written it, it would read, "Be careful." This is known as an imperative sentence.
I really don’t care but he decided to attack my intelligence because inadvertently left out a word.
Just for test
It better be... France helped US when revolutionary war, back in 1700's

كسمك علي كسم فرنسا ياكلاب هنزمكم في اخر الزمان
Thanks for loving our country! The last person tried to make us ashamed of being Americans!

If anyone can duck it up you certainly can sir.
America is HOME in Europe and Europe is HOME in America.We share the same goal.This is the healthiest friendship between two worldwide powers (see more about NATO)Mr. President seems to be always more relaxed and confident when he is here and it's a thing hard to immitate or hide
Look what I can do
Is @realDonaldTrump a traitor? Soft on Russia, spent none of the $120M allocated to stop Russia meddling in ongoing elections. Chooses Tillerson over Romney then fires him because Putin ordered it. #putinspuppet  https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/ … April 24 13:41:09
I don’t know about that I recall that France wouldn’t let the US enter their air space when Iraq invaded Kuwait and again when we respondedto the September 11 attacks. The response by the French government was a clear no
Ive never seen two straight men touch each other so much before
It’s called the ‘You Three’ movement!    Let’s see the ‘Likes’ to support this movement!  Don’t be bias!
Until you get super mad because Macron looks better in his suits...
He is so sarcastic he has to retweet this crap
History also shows that Donnie is a racist. Sooooooo, there’s that.

I thought a Medal of Honor is a military decoration?
Not the Ellis Island one.
Oh shit well damn I gotta look that up
.talk about A GOOD GUY WITHOUT A GUN STOPPING A GUN NUT
Tweeting compliments and affirmations in third person. Lovely.
Quoting someone who is talking about you is *not* considered third person...
Dear #DonaldTrump, I’m wondering how long it will take you to acknowledge the #WaffleHouseShooting, 4 innocent people died. How long will it take you to acknowledge the hero,  #JamesShawJr who put his life on the line to save others. It’s been 2 days, still waiting.
Unbreakable? Based on what exactly? You think he will be loyal to you or the U.S. when he can't even be loyal to his own culture, his own heritage, his own country, his own people? Boy, has he pulled the wool over your eyes! He doesn't give a damn about France's history!
You disappoint me, President Trump. If you see what he is offering as worthwhile you need to be more transparent about what "that is about" and why we should rally behind this traitor to his own country. 
After the Trump administration us real conservatives will never see the country again  sad people can’t see what’s really happening
Allies feel relieved America finally has a leader in the Oval Office!
Bullshit!  Hahahahaha!
As a French, event though I don't like my president, I was happy to see how Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron managed to show the world that the friendship between france and the us is, indeed, unbreakable !
Trump aligns himself with leaders who knifed they're  own and continue to do so .
patriot fires tastes better

That's laughable...the only reason Trump has his tongue in this guy's colon is because the US owes France a shit-load of money!
Don’t touch social security and Medicare give s 400 dollar raise of cost of living for 5 years cheap fk republicans want to think in a hand out we pay its insurance soon we will stop paying tax if you mad republicans keep it up
What did you think about Macron’s address to Congress? How come you didn’t tweet about that? #WorstPresidentEver
True love....... You haven't even made a pass at his wife this time!
#ImmoralTrump should listen to Macron's speech again. There are limits to France's endurance of the erosion of Equality, Liberty and Fraternity. Very tight limits. Macron is a real leader. Trump is not.
@WhiteHouse 
@VP 
@FLOTUS 
@PressSec 
@FoxNews 
P45 must have watched CASABLANCA last night.
Cheese eating surrender monkeys aside.
I miss general de Gaulle...
Trump could end that record
GREAT JOB, MR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!
Trump has an unbreakable relationship with France cause cause he wants President Macron's wife. That's the only reason its unbreakable
How pathetic would you have to be to retweet something about yourself?
Freedom fries?
I voted for you and would vote for you again. Thankypu Mr. President. Still would have liked a chance to meet you when you campaigned in B'ham and there was a bit of a tussel an the police took care of that. Thanks for all you are doing!
呵呵
We will scream forever 
#DownWithUSA 
#مرگ_بر_آمریکا
Thank you Mr President!!!  Keep up the awesome work!!!   #MAGASpirit
This orange bozo is bipolar and as soon as he flips, he will resume the hate on everyone that is not who he likes. We are talking about an openly racist president that called nazis fine people, then denounced them, then again supported them. This man is super sick.
We should take a look at the French health care system.
Every day you hold that office is more embarrassing than the last
You can bet a new Iran deal will be in line with Israel’s demands and they own trump and macron
I am Iranian So I Say (Down With America)
You’re going to jail soon.
Great
They may be our strongest Allie.We must continue to support the french people and help them economically and morally support agreement between our two countries.They are mostly conservatively as close to our values as you can get.
I think Macron had a very different message that he gave after he met with you. The two of you are not on the same page. More #FakeNews from #Trump
The debt America owes to France for helping us gain our independence from Great Britain is enormous!  Only those who have been educated in American history even have an inkling what crucial role France played.  Their assistance bankrupted France, leading to the French Revolution!
Too.Many.Quote.Quotes.
Our relationship with France might be unbreakable but the Iran Deal certainly is!!!
Lets get tough on their iran deal then!
Until some imagined slight changes his mind and he turns on Macron. Wait...it will happen.

Smoke some quality nugs and forget about the fuck up system. Y’all hit me up for the connect.
Until he threw you under the bus in front of congress and then backed it up over you.

yES WE  HAVE HAD A LNG HISTORY BUT REMEMBER THIS: WE LOST MANY GOOD MEN ON NORMANDY. NO TO PARIS TREATY WE LOSE ON THAT DEAL. AS TO CARAVANS CHANGE NAFTA AND LET MEXICO KNOW THAT WE WILL

France's support for us in Syria is not to be lauded. There were no gas attacks. Not this time, nor the previous two.
TO ALL EUROPEAN SLAVERS:

You’re an embarrassment to the world

SCOOP: The F.B.I. first gave the White House counsel a file containing spousal abuse allegations against Rob Porter in March 2017, according to a detailed new timeline the bureau has given to Congress

We salute you from the UK  looking forward to seeing you visit .. you shine and express light and hope.. here's to the new dawning of  a new  era .
Arrests

France is at war with the Muslim situation....The two of you better
come to a mutual agreement/understanding of your two points of view..
Yep, unbreakable.
C’est vrai President Trump.
The most vilified leaders in US media, Trump, Putin, are trolling the world. Macro, May, Merkel, Abe, others are scared that their plug has been pulled. As WW swamp is being drained, watch Trump mock Macron, they both know Macron's time is nearly up. Bye bye deep state thugs!
All we have to do is watch the new Netflix documentary about trump to see very clearly how dishonest and shady he is. #FakePresident

What history might that be, if you don't mind my asking?



Would be one of the few things you didn't break or bankrupt.
So it is a witch hunt!
Recognize the Armenian Genocide.
What history?
Years ago in the United States you wanted to banish French fries now you're totally in love with them
Donald Trump is Unbreakable! Best President ever!
We have been blessed with Pres Trump and that is the only way to put it.
I think you meant "cursed."
I'm not going to waste my time with you troll boy.

Until he sees something on Fox News that tells him otherwise.  France says you're a big jerk dummy head Donald.  What ya gonna do?
So confirming it means you still find need to bash him?

Robert Mueller please hurry up @PressSec
Caution... Objects in Mirror are Closer than They Appear. 
Yeah, that object is about to run off the road, hit the end of a guard rail, and explode in shitty flames. Somewhere around Muellerville, I think.

Mueller stands with Trump!
You need to pay attention kid. Quit eating tid pods and snorting condoms...

Told you guys, trump is stone racist, liar, cheat, adulterous SLIME BALL.  The 1st lady should divorce his post haste.  lol,lol!
It is apparent that you have no moral compass and have utilized the fears and anxieties of your base to project policy for various moneyed interests. Your time is coming. A new generation of voters is dawning. All this will be undone. 
It's great to see Trump on the international stage like this. Macron reneged on the whole Paris Climate Accord thing. Hasn't even brought it up. Can't stump the Trump!
Trump's says his marriage with the First Lady, @FLOTUS, is unbearable, but look who he screwed during that relationship. I wouldn't trust him.
No one gives a damn if you trust him or not. Question is..Do you trust yourself??

Ayuda al pueblo de Nicaragua te necesitamos apollanos hermano q aigan  elecciones justas
Mr.President is in charge of how he feels and today he is choosing happiness.Well Done President.


Trump is going to try and get us involved in a war with North Korea and Iran before any more people from his campaign get arrested.
Candy man
Yes Trump with USA!!!
And USA is not YOU!!!!
I am sure he dont respect you.
He has a smile on his face , but he think what a Big M...on.
Trump resign. An Adult Qualified 
Person should Gover USA.
Not a Golf playing Redneck like you.
Greetings from Europe
@PressSec Except when the president of France  contradicts everything #Spanky45  stands for.  Hahahaha @SarahSanders you my dear are a lying SOS.  Is this you before H&M


Yup right up until you claimed to pick dandruff off his jacket and announced it to the world. You are the worse person imaginable, no wonder Mel detests you. Go have that stroke so Dr Candy can tend to you
As a Brit, I feel left out.
Honestly, same

I made it Mr. Trump, bringing back to this alliance France.

Thank you sir! 
MAGA

Remember when u banned French Fries  from Capitol Hill, when France  said no to the Anti-Saddam Coalition? At that Time nobody talked about an unbreakable Relationship
LIAR!


Hell yeah!   Freedom fries baby!!!   Hahaha
So apparently real news; White House press releases, faux news, and tweets. Fake news; everyone and everything else without something nice to say about the trumpeter.
Fortunately it is unbreakable - not even YOU can screw it up
You will be impeached.
Lafayette we Are here
Your son will remember you as the worst president ever
If you keep being such a biggot, bigmouth it will break very soon.
It's not because of him. It's because of hard working  passed presidents and outstanding cabinet. You just don't have it. Impeachment.
Uh, remember "freedom fries"? Another classy republican maneuver!

You freak!! Stop talking in the 3rd person!
So says Donald J. Trump about what President Trump said?
Thank you Presidents Trump and Marcon for strengthening this great relationship.
Those French, great allies! What a fighting force! The only French most soldiers have learned is "I surrender!"

Just like Japan , Hillary forgets a lesson in America understanding of freedom and law an order
