Stop tweeting and try coming up with a coherent immigration policy instead.
@OrangeHardie @realDonaldTrump
Are you kidding? Raping 13 year olds & green mailing is all he's capable of. DonTheCon sux

- He owns the media #WomensEqualityDay http://wp.me/p78flo-dh

Mika is exactly  where she should be. On a 3rd rate network.
Loretta Lynch, as soon as she finish dinner, will jump on it.
ALERT! RT, I hope this gets to TRUMP. No one from the Trump campaign, or supporting Trump,SHOULDN'T be on any MSM ONLY FOX.
"pastor" Burns is delusional. Separation church and state. #TrumpLies
Where's your apology to President Obama? Did I miss it? Remember, those who live in glass houses...
@realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns @MSNBC @morningmika @Morning_Joe
Even Sarah Palin worries that Trump SOFTENING signals "wishy-washy" path, "massive disappointment."
Bullshit
I did include a link so you can read it yourself.
Apologize? Practice what you preach. Lead by example.
So--apologize is actually within the vocabulary of Trump. #TrumpPaysNoTaxes
@realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns @MSNBC @morningmika @Morning_Joe
Maybe you should make a sincere apology to all the people you have hurt. Not a general I regret.
MSNBC are a bunch of liars and we Trump supporters know it.

If you put opinions out there, everyone has the right to comment. #FAIR
@Morning Joe watched the Burns interview; didn't see an attack. Did it occur off air?
.@realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns @MSNBC @morningmika @Morning_Joe 

Speaking of low ratings...How are those poll numbers?
Talk about pay to play, you do a very good job at that Con Man.
Disgusting! @morningmika attacked @pastormarkburns because he's black! Racist! Just like evil queen HRC
she's a racist white woman who the #rapeugees will do first
- you first, Donald.  For anything, everything- hypocritical request!
@mikesmith8026 @pastormarkburns @MSNBC @morningmika  
Mika has no talent. All she does is sigh and makes faces. Boring.
He is an horrible pastor. Dont need those.
That folks is why the ratings of them are low! Propaganda news channel!
give it a rest Drumpf.  Your pathetic campaign is being rejected soundly
he got everything he deserved religious people should start behaving
Burns is a terrible surrogate who avoids answering questions. He is an entrepreneur who uses religion as a business.
for such "low ratings," it seems you watch it all the time.
.. they tried..butshown n darkness & the roaches scrambled.Prov 1:11,22
she better say SORRY or the Russian will back you! #friendsoftrunmps

Disgraceful MSNBCAntiChristian BIGOTS!ANTICHRISTIAN @msnbc #BLACKOUTMSNBC

Media will sabotage anyone who supports you! YOU HAVE US!
soon trump will only have hannitys shoulder to cry on @Lawrence
Sad the media is protecting Hillary & all her lies, unethical tactics!
Not one question from bobblehead Joe to Hillary during phone in. Sheeple
so they followed your lead in attacking pastors who didn't endorse you
Clinton foundation on watch list
why don't you go on @TheLastWord are you afraid of @Lawrence ? If you can't handle him how are you going to handle Putin?
Because after 40yrs, of empty promises! Enough!
AC is a true reflection of how much DJT really cares, he did nothing

The media is picking on us whaaaah
