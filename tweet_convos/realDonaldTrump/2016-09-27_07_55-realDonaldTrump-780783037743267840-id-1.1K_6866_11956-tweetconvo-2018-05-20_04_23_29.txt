FALSE
and we all know why! Yet those who support him can't see it. Community went from 16% to 12% less 8yrs.
I wonder how much of it has to do with the increase in racism due to Trump's hateful rhetoric and his alt-righters.
He has made it mainstream again. I guess that is how he wanted to Make America Great Again.
Yes, Trump is the sick leader of a racist, white-supremacist, hateful, misogynistic, criminal movement.
where are your tax returns you adult baby
What a wonderful example of all-American Christian values.
@LALS01 @ImagineAnna @realDonaldTrump @WSJ Trumpanzees are violent, angry little creatures.
#TrumpRightAgain. #HilaryFail #TrumpWon
No intelligent woman would vote Trump.
no intelligent woman would vote for a rape enabler like #HillaryTheGrifter #NeverHillary
@MSNBC Bill Clinton is a rapist and Hillary terrorized and destroyed his victims lives 
@huitecouture @Morning_Joe @chucktodd @MSNBC Grow up! Trump is charged with Raping a 13 yr old #NOW.
he's not charged with anything. And, BTW her attorney's specialty is PATENTS. Wonder why
http://youtu.be/Jpstc9r_esA 
yes, everyone has seen that mess brought by a patent attorney
if true, then why have increased gun sales not lowered rate?
Yea, and how are YOU going to fix this, by tweeting?
is this you
nobody cares about Donald Trump's taxes everybody in America tries to pay as little in taxes as they can #CrookedHillary
I would rather have an honest asshole than a lying nice person for president #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #NeverHillary
Complete with picture of black males in background. Nothing racist here Adolf Trump.
A more effective tweet would be you highlighting methods that work and vowing nationwide implementation.
The FBI "murder rate" is not accurate: it does not include deaths that were listed as suicide rather than homicide.
That was when you started stirring up people to act on their prejudices. Your supporters began assaulting minorities.
Sad thing is that your wife is fucking one of those rich Jewish men right now...
The "FBI murder rate" does not include deaths by police officers - their investigations will very seldom result >
@Trump4Hope @WSJ
Yeah & under a President Yee-Haw Trump that figure could B expected 2 rocket stratospherically I'd say @realDonaldTrump @WSJ @DevlinBarrett
will very seldom result in a return of wrongs.  I know of a few as a former police officer and private detective!
That seems to stick a pin into the spinners' bubbles.

VIA FBI: Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions.
A year ago dummy. A whole lot can happen in a year. You oughta know.
Talk about this, trash miss ex universe is not a threat to our country, stop taking clinton bait !
Obama caused the rise of murders he brings evil to the table sir he needs arrested
Lyin Hilllary! Lester Holt needed to fact check her

When Trump started spewing hate-made it ok. for others to hate publicly. Sad!
RESEARCH! The NYPD, GOV and Bloomberg are very angry with you for saying things you know nothing about.
true s tats tics prove otherwise.  You want to return to practices that were found to be unjust.
there is a song by a Canadian band The Guess Who called Guns, Guns, Guns.The song was wrote in 1972. Could be today to
Donald My Man next Debate you got to make Hillary look like a monkey behind that podium, a real crowd pleaser
Thanks Barry!! @realDonaldTrump @maryjones1417 @WSJ
Yep, but it's down a whopping %18.3 from 2006
#lyintrump
But ....but.....Muh ...Muh global warming
Gee, do you think any of this could be because of mental health issues &NRA refusing simple back ground checks?
Increase from what date of reference?
@DevlinBarrett think it has anything to do with announcing your candidacy for president?or just coincidence?
@axlejazzo @WSJ #Millennials #LatinosForTrump   #africanamerican #NC #NH #IA #NV #CA #CO #IL #FL #VA #OH #PA #MN #WA #WI.
who are you going to blame Mr. Trump? #blacklivesmatter
With MSM must know facts to challenge their premise in questions. Town hall format at next debate is different.
@DevlinBarrett Sorry Little Lyin Donaldbut @seanhannity is. Feed you BS. Do your homework
I just started a poll on my Twitter page I am looking to hit at least one million votes go on my Twitter and vote
The murder rate in 2015 was identical to that in 1958.
yeah police shooting black ppl
Even if true, the only way to fix it is Gun Control. So, Trump wants to take away your guns & repeal 2nd Amendment.
The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%. Hmmmm.....
defending you is difficult, I feel for your surrogates. I bet the election can't come soon enough for them.
hey donny, you have the country laughing at you when they see your surrogates trying to defend you.
And yet you think the entire country should have as many guns as they want.
Well, if you will have ignorant gun laws...
10.8%? And how the heck they missed you is beyond us,all.
But your (dishonest) contention in the debate was in regards to NYC murder rate.  Actually lower after Stop and Frisk.
NYC Murders down since ending Stop and Frisk.
hmmm just when you started to run for president. Coincidence?? Nope!
- Coincides perfectly with the time frame that you've been running your divisive campaign. Hmmmmm? ;-)
Only person in America happy about increasing murder rate
@Lewis31m OK murders up, full story: overall 2015 still represented 3rd lowest year for violent crime in past 20 years
Murders per 100,000 was 9.4 in 1990, 6.8 in 1997, 4.4 in 2014, 4.9 in 2015 http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm … #TrumpPence16

wrong, wrong, wrong...as quoted by the current mayer of NYC.  You lied again.  Caught you!
@gcamp4 @WSJ   CONGRATS OBUMMER 
@DevlinBarrett why? Because of you Donald. It's the real reason. I will defeat you. Even if I must do by myself.
I believe that. We still do STOP & SEARCHES in my country and it has proved successful drugs & illegal f/arms found.
Thanks to you and the NRA.
Geez Donny  are you taking credit for that? Now the spike in suicides that could follow your election, that's all you!
is that police killing black men stats because that seems low.
You can take FULL CREDIT for this one. No surprise it increased during your candidacy.
how many people have the kkk killed?
That is 3.9% increase percent via FBI and 16.5% lower than 10 yrs ago... Thank you!
Law & Order
more lies from Trump
@cannonkel @WSJ 
Obama policy's on DEVIDE and conquer,and his cronies ,,
with you in the game, it will even increase further... #greedysob
...as a result of Democrat rot. The Dems are too busy serving themselves and their own interests. @HFA
What part does your pompous behaviour and rhetoric contributing to all this? I say a lot. @MSNBC @HillaryClinton
trump is an example of verbal violence didnt go up in gary was the murder capital of americs thanks obamano tyou trump
@DevlinBarrett you said in any it went up WRONG

that is the reason we can not vote her in Therefore Mrtrump is the rightful candidate to go for American

Libreals are trying to hide this.. sick of hearing how GREAT my country is doing.. Hillary / Obama lies to get votes
WRONG!!!!
ya probably because of all the murders conducted across the US by police. No accountablility
Someone needs to tell NBC and Comcast the truth
And the only reason NY has dropped recently is that people are doing more drugs, therefore missing their targets.
should have hit her on this, oh wait @LesterHoltNBC wouldnt allow it
because of the increase in guns funneled into the streets by your NRA and your white supremist republicans.
@Lstoud1 @WSJ @BarackObama

Life in #ObamasAmerica...

@HillaryClinton will continue his legacy...

 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thanks Mr. Soon To Be President for talking about Chicago in the 1st Debate, Hillary didn't hardly touch that topic.
SO WHERE WERE YOU ON THIS DURING DEBATE? OOPSIE?
@malski1954 @WSJ An Excellent Reason for:
#StopQuestionFrisk & #LawandOrder
#Trump will correct this Problem & #MASA
#MAGA
#Trump continues to LIE to his naive fans. The discussion was NYC.

@realDonaldTrump @WSJ #TrumpPence16 #Election2016 #Birther
#debatenight
Exactly! And you support the NRA.
#itdontmatter #thuglife
@kgeagel9s5 @WSJ yes since trump candidacy divisions have grown big league.
#thatis from2015Donald! #youspokeyetanothermistruth
POTUS and the previous Attorney Gen. have bloods on their hands. Deplorable pieces of shit. GO Trump!!
Obummer has been the most divisive president for my people in the history of the US!! #NeverHillary
#HillaryRottenClinton wrong again, desperate attempt to deceive electorate with more lies!
you cslled it tight again, clinton  is out of  touch
Crime overall, including murders, is way down from what it was 10 and 20 years ago. Stop the fear-mongering Donny.
@KatrinaPierson @WSJ @DevlinBarrett We'd like to thank you Barack Obama the wet noodle do nothing Pres!
Everyone know wsj is just fox news in print non legit sh*t.
@peacemakerpete It's midnight in America in Trump's darkened mind.
and to many of us it feels that way.
Why? Objectively, things are going well compared to when Obama took office. Hate & partisanship are badmouthing the nation.
I love when you speak like one with authority and ignore statistics showing a contrary view. Then you call it bad mouthing.
What? Again, objectively, things are far better than before. Violent crime included. Check the figures, don't rely on Trump.
the murder rate figures are not from Trump. Your hate and partisanship blinds you into a false sense of Patriotism.
Again, it's simply a fact that violent crime, including murder, is down from when Obama took office. You're being misled.
Black Pastors in Chicago begged for vouchers to get Kids out of dangerous unsafe schools! Unions say no!
the jobs that you can create & Hillary can NOT, along with better relationships will help to reduce amt.of violence!!!
BECAUSE OF OBAMA!!!!
@Faye0226 @WSJ @DevlinBarrett I recall some of my Twitter friends bragging about violent crime rates falling. Wrong.
'Sane people get it - Stop & Frisk works, its just common-sence.
SAD. :( LAW & ORDER. Bring it on, Mr. Trump!
...and are already back down in 2016 so far.
nice try murders down substantially over past 10 years: stop trying to con people with partial data
Yep, that's hope and change for ya
because of amendment 2, thank you very much
if this is true,murders over all r dwn. knowing u this all ur information r generally lies. So no don't believe u
http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/dueling-claims-on-crime-trend/ …
it's not 2015
What do you intend to do about it?  We don't need another news reporter
please don't confuse Liberals and @HillaryClinton with facts.
Context is everything...
@DevlinBarrett But you said NEW YORK.
add DNC leaker and V. Foster to the murder list #BloodOnClintonHands
no excuse for last night. Sad
probably Chicago, where Obama has ignored his whole political life.
Of course, not what you said, douch. You said increase in NYC and Chicago. Wrong again, clown.
this lawless administration can't continue hillary will have us looking like Germany
I sent this to you before the debate last night! I wish you had seen it so you could #Destroy her! #factcheck #follo
give em more guns Trumpy
with Trump as president  people will heave hope and jobs!
No pettiness, nail HRC's
2 the wall w/stats & facts! Nuke Deal: non binding & no
inspections. Crime rate, GDP, etc

bcuz GOP owned by NRA. . NO BACKGROUND CHECKS.. GUNS FOR EVERYONE!!!! GET RID OF GOP AND GUN CRIME GOES DOWN.
Another murder took place at the debate, the victim the pig Trump
THANKS OBAMA!!!
False claim as usual.  Take a look at FBI stats.  https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-1 …
#thanksnra
Did you read the CIUS report or just look at the headline?
in case you have forgotten what happened to Bush.
It would be horrifying to know what would happen with you oh, I can't even say it, much less picture it. Shoes fllying
And HRC denied that fact.
-A Black American on Facebook said he knew blacks are killing blacks and who ever they choose .
