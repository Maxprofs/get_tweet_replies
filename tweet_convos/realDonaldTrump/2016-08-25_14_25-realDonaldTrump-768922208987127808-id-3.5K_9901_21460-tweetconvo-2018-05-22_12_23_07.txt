The jig is up and you've been made. You're a racist and the entire world now knows it without a doubt. #altDelete #altRight
Who has been party to and supportive of the most destructive policies towards minorities in America? Hillary
I can either believe my ears and eyes or your willful ignorance. It's a simple choice. https://youtu.be/hQLzyP05sxs  @realDonaldTrump
3. the first woman president. Trump would have very little latitude so is far less dangerous. Easier2impeach
3. The executive branch is far too important to play games with. Trump is a political and policy ignoramus. @realDonaldTrump
It IS too important to play games with. Obama did, hillary will erode senatorial power even more.
Sorry, but your opinion isn't very convincing evidence. @realDonaldTrump
Lol Obama superseded congress and expanded executive orders beyond their scope. Don't deny it,own it.
I wish he'd bring up how offensive it is for his supporters to be called racists!! It has become old and r's just take it.
.#HillaryClinton just described #TrumpSupporters as #RadicalFringe. When #Trump takes office, that #fringe'll want U jailed
@EntheosShines @CNN
@CNN I believe in you. HRC is a fraud. Just stick to the issues at hand. The most important thing 2 do, stick 2 your guns!
You are the
#MostDangerousManinUS ... You must not be near the nuclear codes.
You are gross... You are a caricature of a real politician reading off a #Bannon script spouting lies& conspiracy theories.
LOL. @HillaryClinton  gave facts. You on the other hand use @BreitbartNews #GutterPolitics of lies and #conspiracytheories
She's just copying what she learned from Trump in the GOP Primary.
Both = sleazy & selfish
@Evan_McMullin

fat
you're right again Mr Trump!
if the shoe fits
using your words and entourage against you -smart playbook
Trumps 2 best assets #melaniaescorts
But at least it's true!
who fucking care @bestofraps
Дави их, Дон.
yes but she's smearing them with their own shit.
can someone remind her of this. praising KKK member & racist Robert Byrd as her "friend and mentor"

#AltRightMeans Supporting Donald Trump Who is in Bed with the Kosher Right, CNP, Blackwater & the Knights of Malta https://youtu.be/6FJiG0XsAWg 
@CNN is more when a Democrat policy fails they blame the failure on Republicans. Dems just call Reps. "Racist" #Trump2016
.@realDonaldTrump I'm using the Trump Playbook. Lie. Complain. Whine. Throw a tempter tantrum. Insult! Thats how my presidency will be too.
exactly!!!!!
Trump uses tactic of calling out others for what he is guilty of. Trump sued in 1970 by Feds for rental discrimination
Racist is the go-to phrase for Dems when their minds short circuit & they have no defense for failing the US people. #MAGA
Hillary is the real conspiracy theory.

go away
If you're still losing in October, do the right thing. Get Gary Busey in to run the campaign. Omaha Steaks not his fault!
@CNN you are really racist though
@mike_pence @MediaBuzzFNC @nytimes @latimes @USATODAY Trump we've seen who you are regardless of how your minders leash you

Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness IS NOT a rule Democrats follow. Why should they?
SHAME ON YOU.
thats actually true remember the saying from Lyndon B.
"Ill have them niggers voting Democratic 4 the next two hundred yr"
You can't be responsible for every person who supports you. That dad supported the Taliban yet went to HRC rally smiling.
Donald, you're racist,you're racist,you're racist.
what, he who rape 13 year olds has no balls? DonTheCon is Bill Cosby 2.0. The Archie Bunker of politics!
he abuses women like Bill Cosby, even 13 year olds.
realDonaldTrump
shut the fuck up you fat cunt
Laughed so hard when @KatrinaPierson said that Hillary was scared. She didn't look or sound scared to me
@edwiley1960 @SandraBridges1 @realDonaldTrump @CNN @KatrinaPierson
@BanjoHfuhruhur @edwiley1960 @SandraBridges1 @realDonaldTrump @CNN @KatrinaPierson
She is just a piece of S***, who gives ladies a bad name.

un educated read the sign !
Wouldn't be calling names Julie. Prove the quote!  I don't blindly buy @BreitbartNews #GutterPolitics ...
reference the crime bill Hillary wrote she said that. Hillary is racist in private just another lie.
read what she said to 17 magazine in 1995
@CNN You have no clue what it is to be a minority in America. #TrumpYourself
Hillary Clinton in Black History.   A must watch. ..
CREEPY @HillaryClinton USES OLDEST PLAY IN THE DEM-PLAYBOOK..
DESTROY THEIR OPPONENT
@CNN I'm a black Reagan Democrat who does not vote Democrat I am not a zombie.
DT
Just gonna leave this here. From yesterday.
Donald Trump calls Hillary Clinton a bigot during speech in Mississippi
Do you know what bigot means? Means intolerant of other's views. That isn't an insult, it is just a fact.
If you want to get technical...
That is a corrupted English definition, which is why Merriam-Webster is a shit source for definitions.
@XGrabMyY
She'll say the OED, the FINAL WORD on the English language is WRONG in 3, 2, 1.
locker room talk never killed 4 people in benghazi. Hillary DID!
@AmitMathur02 @CNN there's nothing she can say or do we love Trump 2016
@CNN You are the worst.

@TYRAVOICE True Story
@CNN no matter what you do, the lamestream media will find something wrong with it but don't worry we've got your back!
she's called him a bigot and a racist along with Pocahontas several times. You're a known troll
no, no its not. It's calling someone out for lying and cheating their way through school. She's a lyin fraud
what's racist is lying about being a certain race to get accepted into a college you wouldn't otherwise smh
that's all you have. Every cycle no matter what. Anyone who disagrees is racist. Such a pathetic argument
"We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population..."and Hillary "admires" Margaret Sanger
Right. She didn't want her worked misconstrued...exactly like you're doing. Sad! @4x_Clubchamp @realDonaldTrump
read the  paragraph in its context. She wanted to "hire" black preachers to keep "the more rebellious" in check
Nope. Not 'in check'. Ministers could help educated those that didn't understand her efforts. @4x_Clubchamp @realDonaldTrump
wow... drink that Koolaid...
Stop. Why did civil rights leaders support a woman that sought to 'exterminate' them? Any ideas? Good grief. @4x_Clubchamp @realDonaldTrump
in 1926, Sanger spoke at a Ku Klux Klan rally in Silver Lake, New Jersey. Then bragged about getting more invites
No dear, she spoke at a meeting with WIVES of the Klan about birth control. @4x_Clubchamp @realDonaldTrump
@wjkkarma1 THIS IS A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT! How does killary get away with it? Are we in America ?
@CNN Put a fork in you. You are done. She nailed you with you own words. Stop crying about it.
Another misinformed statement from a hater..lol!!!
sorry, unlike #Trump fans, I deal in facts
Apparently not
I feel sorry for you. Denial is a powerful thing. Have a nice day
LOL
jeez guy, really? What are you, 12? Have a nice day=bye, I'm done with you. No response required
All your supporters are racists tho @realDonaldTrump
huh?? Man kind cry constantly over being offended. Can I cry liar bully undereducated... Something?
Are you saying you need a safe space? I'm I offending your fee fees? @tlombardo21 @realDonaldTrump
oh yes please... I need a safe place cause you're scary.
I know you do @tlombardo21 @realDonaldTrump
do you believe you're analysis of millions of people?
That millions of people supporting a campaign built on racism are racists? I mean, if the shoe fits @tlombardo21 @realDonaldTrump
and you're still falling for it.

Unsure what #AltRightMeans? This will leave no doubt. (h/t @BlueNationRev) 
.@realDonaldTrump Calling you a racist isn't a new thing. People have been pointing that out since your company refused to rent to blacks
wow that's an interesting imagination you got there 
.@Jasonlovecougar Look up the very real DOJ case against @realDonaldTrump for racial discrimination. Every example is easy to confirm.
doesn't look it for me
.@Jasonlovecougar @realDonaldTrump Are you unfamiliar with how Google works?
oh dear
.@Jasonlovecougar @realDonaldTrump It's a legitimate question.
no, just no
or: when their policies are working, they attack the dumb bigots because it's fun
@Bill_TPA @realDonaldTrump
oh hi you're behind lemme catch you up that's photoshopped & he was briefly in the KKK literally 70 years ago
Not exactly. He founded a KKK chapter & recruited 150+ members.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/18/AR2005061801105.html …
yeah that doesn't actually contradict what I said at all
U said that he was briefly in the KKK. If by briefly U mean more than a decade then OK
it wasn't more than a decade. It was a couple years
1944 - 1956
you're a racist
bullshit... He wants to make us safe and the group that threatens our lives happens to be radical Muslims.
Shall I point out that right-wing nationalists are responsible for 80% of terror casualties in western countries?
You 2 are the racists that cannot bring yourselves 2 admit there is validity 2 our concerns because it isn't PC.
That's not how reality works, dude. @jonrosenberg
You 2 are the types that aren't going 2 figure out what's happening in the world until ISIS is on your street.
Has it occurred to you that maybe we have a better understanding of what's going on in the world than you do? @jonrosenberg
ISIS is a failed group with no ability to project power outside the dwindling Mideast regions it controls. @jonrosenberg
Dems have played that card so many times it has lost meaning to the average American.
.@realDonaldTrump .you're failing so badly, but all is not lost - I have reserved this Twitter handle for your real calling #POTTUS
If an AfricanAmerican did@classified emails what #Clinton did+FBI confirms lies about it,would she/he also get a free pass?
@CNN Donald orangutan ass face trump will wreck USA worse than Bush to a point even Obama can't fix it.
@JaredWyand @CNN EPIC RESPONSE! Good job Mr Trump!! We are NOT racist! #TrumpPence16
