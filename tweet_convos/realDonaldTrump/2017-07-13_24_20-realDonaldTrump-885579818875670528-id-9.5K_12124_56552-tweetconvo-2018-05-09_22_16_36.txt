Weird, because I seem to remember you supporting Marine Le Pen:
A candidate so reviled by every other politician in France for her far-right views that they all effectively got behind Macron.
In the process being incredibly critical about how France was running their own country.
Quoting approvingly comments that said French gun control resulted in terrorist attacks: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/553258779887017984 …
Inciting hatred by saying that France had let itself fall to Muslim communities: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/553851865105186816 …
And of course, now you're belittling the French President's wife by treating her like prize cattle:
Trump tells the First Lady of France, Brigitte Macron: “You’re in such good shape … beautiful”
Having already isolated yourself from most of the West - in particular France & Germany by being a dick about NATO:
Withdrawn from the Paris Accords under false pretenses causing widespread mockery:
You're a filthy old pervert. Maybe stop objectivity women. They're certainly not here to look nice for you, you degenerate.
For once, just try to act like an adult, or even a human. We've given up on you ever acting presidential, that's for sure.
The bond between France and America might be unbreakable, but Brigitte Macron's arm is NOT unbreakable.
Take it easy, Trump.
#FridayFeeling
What the hell is he doing? Absolute madman.
Right?
And then there's this.
God, he's disgusting.
"Such good shape."
*shudder*

But steals billions more!
 did @jaketapper tell you this? Or was it an anonymous source?
His tax returns did. Oh wait....
Wrong 
Those numbers are from all different years so it's misleading ...and the fact that you think Trump pays taxes is hilarious 
You're*

"Verily I say into thee grabbeth them by the pussy especially if married for thou art a celebrity and verily they shall rejoice." Trump 3:16
That verse is actual from Gropians 6:9

Thank you Mr @POTUS for KEEPING your word! may God bless you and may God bless the #USA 
God has no place in politics.
@VP Thank you Mr @POTUS for KEEPING your word! may God bless you and may God bless the #USA 
God has no place in politics. Let them pay the same taxes we all do m. Until then, separation of church and state
Religious people pay taxes
And so do atheist. Politicians represent ALL the people. Religion should never be mentioned by them.
Completely agree!
Revelation 22:21
The #grace of our #LordJesusChrist be with you all. #Amen.

#Saudi with weapons of #US killing beautiful Children of #Yemen Why? @NickKristof @hrw @UN @UNReliefChief @tedlieu
28 months of #Saudi aggr on #Yemen have created what the UN has described as the world's largest humanitarian crisis
No one in #Yemen can count on a job,
No one has food ,OR money to seek medical assistance .
@AP 
#EndYemenSiege 
If it's about "human rights" then why does the media cover Syria & not Yemen (world's worst humanitarian crisis since WW2)?
I have no good comment but want to elevate this thread.  I'm so sorry . . .
Same here.
Trump will never accuse Saudi Arabia of terrorism, because he has business interests there. He only cares about money, not people.
When you call someone your friend, when everyone knows they hate you


Illegal votes don't count.
And I'm sure you have a reasonable link to share showing how many illegal votes were casr
**cast
I'm trying out something that @crashcoursestan recommended.
The idea is to create a thread around a tweet like this. Especially if you're Twitter verified, which I am.
You can use the thread to talk about something you think is important. Like Medicaid. Read my @UpshotNYT piece here:
You may also enjoy our YourTube show @HCTriage. We have an episode on the Senate's Health Care bill here:
We'll also have an updated episode on the new revisions to the Senate Bill tomorrow. Go check it out then!
So basically you're trying to promote your uninteresting writing on a Trump tweet? Hate to break it to you, its not a new idea by any means
actually, it's pretty clever. Healthcare more impt than Trump's silly tweets
the friendship is one sided

Thank God 

Donald Trump is a fighter! 

Our Champion!

True Patriot who loves his country!

#PresidentTrump
Better watch my friend, you may anger the brain dead CULT 45. LMAO
You know how you break a friendship? You manhandle his wife. This behavior is unacceptable and inexcusable. Period.
this footage is even worse.. 
She was pulling her arm away. You ought to felt that and let her go. She shouldn't have to hide behind another woman to get away from you.
This is rape culture behavior. 
@BetsyDeVosED take note.
He never did that to DeVos!

Is that the new narrative? Lynch set up Don Jr, recognizing that the Trump family’s gene pool is tainted with stupidity? 
The Trump family’s gene pool IS tainted with stupidity (And mental illness)
This is the first time in history a Republican has have referred to something "bi" as great.
Especially in reference to you
I'm bi, do you have a problem with bi people?
Trump has a problem with anyone who doesn't sing his praises, drink his kool-aid and buy his bull. So yeah, Trump has a problem with me. 
I don't have to drink his Kool aid to love my country and want everyone to prosper!  It's called patriotism, something you know very little

The Lord is with you President Trump. The enemy may come in like a flood but the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him
thank you donald trump...you are amazing...you say amazing things...america needs your voice....every tweet burns bright as an atomic bomb

i would prefer a professional states person that was against everything the average person thinks acceptable to this fucking cheater-cheato
I like how you've combined venting your frustration and clarifying that your previous tweet was on fact not in support of him (shocker) ;)
i don't give a fuck what you like. you are nothing.
You don't have to be a 'trump supporter' to believe Hillary would've been far worse for Syria & where was all this outrage under Obama?

You got along wonderfully. Great plans on how to make America, France and the entire world GREAT AGAIN. Thank you Mr. President!

Uh, kcuf no he isn't. 
Sorry to tell you he was voted in with the majority vote.  DNC caught red handed but it's not covered because the connections run deep

Never happen. The people that hated him still hate. The people that love him are still sheep. However the middle now sees his bullshit
I've never called for anyone to be murdered. Just hoping he gets impeached from office. Treason is not a joke to me.

You know what else is unbreakable? This country's desire to get you out of the White House...
Likelihood Trump wrote this = Zero. There's no way he knows how to add accents to letters.
Between our two nations and ourselves?? 
How many nations is that altogether?
...until you inevitably say something insanely awful about them or their country, or they don’t do what you want.

Uhh...just to let you know!
I feel so bad for the leaders of the other countries. They have to deal with the US's #FakePresident.
•Your hand certainly is breakable when you & @EmmanuelMacron meet
•Looks painful
•Add France/Macron to list of nations/leaders that own you

I know you have to be presidential, Mr President, and I know you must maintain good relations, but I'd bet you'd just love to crack his jaw!
Presidential??? He sexually harassed Macron's wife!!! I think the one wanting to crack a jaw would be Macron... for good reason.
 Yeah, she's a cougar alright. She'll be seeing the taxidermist shortly.
Yeah, and it's a very down-to-earth American thing to say..."You look in great shape". Harmless stuff. Some people are rabid re big Donald.

Thank you so much for being the greatest leader I've seen in my lifetime. My heart breaks for all the persecution the Trump family endures.
Almost as unbreakable as your shared commitment to the 1%

Funny that you are using past tense..... here's hoping it will be very soon.

With friends like you, France doesn't need enemies.
But we still not giving money for the Paris BS. Climate money scam
macron never my president !
Macron's Machiavellian moves on trump are brilliant. He pushes Germany and Britain aside by ego bumping 44.5. DJT so easily played.
Macron is a smart ass. Old Merkel is so envious of this France-US approach.

Mr. President, I hope you have a very successful trip. Just ignore the goons on Twitter that have nothing but negativity to spread. #MAGA
Jimmy Carter is 92 y/o & out building @Habitat_org houses. While our sweet potato w/ mange @POTUS is 71 & rides golf carts everywhere.
Love this tweet! Honor, compassion & lifelong dedication to public service come to mind when talking about President Carter. Don? Imposter!
Correct spelling, use of accents, calm, measured tone, no monosyllabic comment with exclamation mark at the end... Trump's staff wrote this.

Decia enfrances que Monsieur le President @EmmanuelMacron  es un politico y Présidente con Angel que incluye la ternura hasta en sus saludos
Por eso y por mucho mas lograra suavizar y ablandar hasta el coloso de no importa que Rodas
And you're full of hate, it seems.
Not even a little bit.  Quick to judge
My bad..have a wonderful weekend!
No worries.  Thanks -
Didn't you support Le Pen #asshat?  And Macron despises you behind closed doors. He sees you for the oaf and liar you are.
For a moment I thought you were going to say "unbelievable"
'something cld happen' on climate accord? U hv softened ur stand on H1B, NAFTA, Refugees & Immigration too. Pl do not compromise ur promises
Your command of the English language and wording is awe inspiring
A "normal"  person wrote this, not you. There's a 4-syllable word + proper grammar & spelling usage, including the accent marks. Fake tweet!
Since you are only seeing him, you can just say “meeting.” But I know, “branding.” #eyeroll
I guess when you can hit on his wife and get away with it then it must be unbreakable.
Is France France now?

I highly doubt any relationship you are associated with is unbreaksble!
He thinks you're a clown like the rest of the world.
You said it was unbreakable and then you said: Hold my beer
You are easily played. A little pomp and circumstance - fluffing your feathers and you are proclaiming life long commitment.
amazing to see
Hey , did you say bi polar meetings?
#TRUMP,,..#forthewin,..#msm,,..is a #joke,,. #hillarylost,..#getoverit,..
Just don't try to  his wife
Macron "shakes" President Trump's hand, but we all know that inside, Macron is really holding Trump's hand. #itsjustalittlecrush
Such a shame our president is not one elected by the people. We need to end the electoral college. One person one vote is true democracy.
oh trust me honey i know you'll find a way to break it
Macron would love to see these!!!
Aww..trump thinks he actually made a friend.
We voted for you and love the job that you are doing . Drain the swamp and term limits!!!!!
Despite the fact that he represents nearlt the polar opposite of you. I can't imagine a more tiny fisted pantywaist as POTUS.
How's Jim?
I am sure Emmanuel has the EXACT same feelings towards you, Knobtwat.
Your inability to tie a necktie is an international embarrassment. Sad, Sad, Fake President.
The friendship between our nations has nothing, zero, zip to do with you. You are an embarrassment and a joke to all civilized people.Resign
Improper use of a reflective pronoun! (Ourselves) please brush up on your grammar and try again
Macron is so playing you,obviously you don't know the French and their strength,you're weak very weak in their eyes!
- I'm sure you can find some way to fuck it up!!! You are delusional !! Stop tweeting!
Love, love love this Video!
I have no doubt that you'll break the friendship between our two nations as soon as you open your idiotic mouth; because you are a #Buffoon
Well I am taking EU FIRST POLICY and stopped by American fodder. Out with coke, McDonald's, Levi's.....
I'm praying for you
You're a lying liar.
My best Muslims not sported terrorism!
Dear President Trump and First Lady Melania, I wish you together with my entire family safe flight home today!
We PRAY FOR YOUR SAFETY!!
Ne lui faites pas confiance!! Jamais!
You should really watch what you have said about France. YOU ARE A LYING HYPOCRIT!!

Felicitaciones  sr. Presidente  Trump 
In sure he had to take a shower to wash the disgust off himself apres votre departure

Your unbreakable friendship was already broken before you arrived.
This is fun Sniffles,why don't you join me on a song,Connect The Dots, La La, La La La!
My Muslim not terrier
Your the man! Lol.
But if anyone could break it, it'd be you! #giantmanbaby
GET OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE !!!!  We are sick of you !!! You are the worst president in American history !!!!
You were played like a violin. Remember when you were so sure Obama liked you.
Macron's obsession with you is, at the very least!
Okay
Sadly your grammar is not up to 3rd grade level.
#liberals are taking a #daily #youtube #beatdown,, from #trumps 34 #million #twitter #gang,..#LOL
Our two nations and ourselves? Is there a 3rd nation?
Too bad that he laughs at you the minute that you leave. He's too polite to do it to your face. All leaders know to stroke your ego.
He's just not that into you, buddy. Sorry bout it. Delete your account
Your comments to the First Lady of France really highlights how disgusting you are. #ImpeachTrump
This is such a senile man. Do you remember what you said a few months ago?  Commit this sexual harassing liar.
Love our president!!!!
Impeach
Yeah try not too mess it up 
Respectfully, sir, I couldn't care less if you're friends w/Macron. I'm however glad whenever we can sincerely count another nation a friend
On t'emmerde. Cordialement la France
You are delusional - other gov'ts are laughing behind your back! You continue to embarrass! Resign or die in jail!
