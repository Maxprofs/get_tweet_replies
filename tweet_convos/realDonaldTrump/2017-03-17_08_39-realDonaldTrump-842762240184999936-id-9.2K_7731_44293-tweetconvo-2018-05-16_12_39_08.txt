Donald Trump is the best president for me.
@NguynThnhVn16
Ok ey
Had Hillary met Merkel, Europe and US would now be stronger together.
Instead, Mr Tinyhands was unable to even handshake at photo op.
@LiveEUDebate @realDonaldTrump you spelt 'the immigrants would now be stronger', wrong!!!
You spelled »I am afraid of a skin color, because Trump told me to be« wrong.
Why should I listen to Mr Trump, I'm English. If people INTEGRATED, there wouldn't be problems!
Having a different culture does not mean you are an idiot.
Being one does.
err I never said that anyone was an idiot. I'm talking about the lack of integration from other cultures!!!
did they jest say yes min furor
Good Job not shaking Merkel's hand as she has destroyed Germany, she is hated over there!
Awkward
Great meeting with the @RepublicanStudy Committee this morning at the @WhiteHouse! ...

djt you egomaniac twat
always thanking God for your successful Presidency!
President Trump, U R our Voice. Thank you for hearing our cry. We love you.
the meeting with Angela Merkel did not go too good. Read German news- disaster
defunding the poor and elderly but tax deductions for the 1% is called social Darwinism
Great Meeting to cut meals, health care, U R making Millions as Pres. Get out of our W H.
stroked you just right. You are a very,veregotistical man your intellect is bigly impaired
There is no doubt in my mind his staff posted this.  He has no ability to understand how to post four pics in one tweet
So much stupid in such a confined area.

Hannity is a dick

That's not hate, it's concern for the US. Hate is the alt-right supremacists
Well where was your concern the last 8 years.
The Rights hate? The Left owns Ferguson, Baltimore, Berkeley.
Cop who shot Mike Brown in Ferguson admitted he lied.
nice
keep up the hard work! Thank you for your service!
Did you tell them all the info you got from FOX and Infowars?
24 million reasons to resist #Trumpcare
Give me a break. Arbitration is going on the plan at the end will have the wrinkles ironed out.
Tough week- go to FL and eat some more. Maybe you will explode. Cost US 3 mil for you to loaf.
.   You are doing a great job. Prayers, lots of prayer for you.
...Ok then.
that's good
hey Don how do you feel about your team dismissing your wiretapping from UK claims? #Maniac
Great job, Mr. President! Working hard to MAGA
would you let this man care for your children?Like, with no other adults around

Donnie you got it wrong that is your brain
or JumboShrimp, HonestDonny and other OxyMorons
Republicans study? What do they study? Certainly not social trends, the Bible, economics, ethics, math or the Constitution.
And in addition, if it wasn't for the elderly; America would have never got this far.
"And here I am telling GOP what to do. I have the best advice."
.@realDonaldTrump @RepublicanStudy @WhiteHouse If Republicans study they will realize you are a fraud!!
Fairly certain that they're a ProLife group. I feel like that muddies the whole
Hey Bro, how you going to deal with North Korea if you can't even get Snoop Dogg to say "I'm Sorry"?

Sounds like he's talk'n bout Agent !! 
We liberal tears. That means @realDonaldTrump is Winning for America everyday 
Cancelling veterans suicide line, EPA, meals on wheels, got you feeling proud?
Studying what? How to hurt the less fortunate? Amazing they voted for you b4 they knew. #TheResistance
Not my President?
No one was surprised by any "new revelations" The administration was in attack mode long before he was elected
Remember this one? 
Hoping to dissuade voters by implying it was already over? 
No truth, just desperation.
People are upset, Russians might have interfered in the election?  Yet ignore the truth; Ad/news agencies did.
Hillary spent a Billion dollars to get elected. 
The bulk of it went to the same ad/news networks.

Bought their vote on Health bill by throwing even more people off Medicaid. Are your voters disposable We'll see 2018 -2020
These Republicans are die hard trump supporters and were always yes  votes on this bill.
he's had a jealous-boy grudge against the Chancellor at least since 2015 sulky tweet.
He just has 2 b picked 1st. I was always picked last in P.E., but I don't blame U.S.!
A group without any backbone.  Embarrassment to America.
The word is awkward....
Morning liar !! Have another great day on the American people!
Enjoy the guaranteed 2 year honeymoon. Your team gets to run with it. Doesn't happen often.
where was the Secretary of state?  why was ivanka there?  Merkel can handle your weak cabinet.
isn't republicanstudy an oxymoron

I think you should meet with the Democrats. They seem to have the people's interest at heart.
Keep up the fantastic work Mr. President.
Cinco De Mayo is coming. Get your ties ready.
It was so stressful you had to take your 7th weekend in Fla. What a ripoff.
the KKK
was Louie Gohmert there?
Ha! Rep Louie Gohmert nails it on #RyanCare: “amidst the horse excrement, we can find a pony around here somewhere” 
the name of that meeting/group is an intentional oxymoron, right?

Also, might want to start studying the French revolution
At NO time in the last 57 days has #POTUS shown himself to be truthful.  Listen to the constituents outcry, read tweets. We the people of 
Do NOT want any a #wealthcare plan. We Need a True Healthcare plan that is for the majority of the people.  Not for the top 1%.
STAND STRONG Republican against this #wealthcare proposal VOTE NO!  #TheResistance #stoptherobbery #TrumpDontCare He doesn't need Healthcare
If you don't stand up for us, the people in the lower income brackets...who will. #WeThePeople need you to be our Voice! VOTE NO #WEALTHCARE
Unfortunately,  many low income people vote against their own interests.  I just don't understand it!!!
WE REALIZE THERE MUST BE A GIVE AND TAKE AND WE ALSO REALIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE WILL GET WHAT THEY WANT. MATURITY IS GOOD.
Real stupidity of the first order from a stupid peresident chairing a very stupid meeting
Watch this woman react to Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a 'bigot'

they only came for pizza
they laughed at my jokes, then laughed at my budget, then laughed at me behind my back.
OH

Trump, YOU'RE FIRED!

smh
Republican study is an oxymoron.  If they studied, they'd understand climate change & poverty
NO credibility, is inept, and no one fears him. Trumpcare is failure. Incompetence Exposed
Ohh...did you forget you SQUANDERED your credibility? "Great = Why are only Ryan & McConnell bowing to me?"
Why are you kids sitting in on  meetings? They don't belong there  anymore than you do.
Sehr gut Mein Fuhrer! Adolf also held "great" meetings with his henchmen when planning the Final Solution!
Like Sochi dogs on a bone.
138 million!!!!!! Bullshit
plans to screw his supporters and most Americans  vote blue in midterms  @RepublicanStudy @WhiteHouse
His mask is off. Forgotten men & women of America are the real losers.
I luv u
2.-The solution is political. Be aware of my proposal; «Wall No, solutions Yes».
"Your" health care plan is doomed like your Muslim ban! Buffoon!
Mr President THANK YOU for all that you do for the AMERICAN PEOPLE - May Jesus guide you daily
dude is there ever a bad meeting?
Did Putin conference call in?
enjoy meeting w/ POTUS. support #TrumpCare u will need to get out  your resume.  #loosers
what did you eat?????
"Donald John Trump lost the 2016 election by millions of votes."
Refusing to shake hands with another world leader like a petulant child does not make for a great meeting.
so many white people and gold walls and 45 man spreading
Where's FLOTUS Ivanka?
another one just  snuck on the White House property The crazies are coming for you. How does it feel to be a hated target
Talking about money ... WTSF?!! @SpeakerRyan @IvankaTrump @FLOTUS @PressSec @VP @GOP you are the biggest PO "man" EVER !!
Glad to see the MLK Bust has a good view.It's the closest thing you have to representation in your group.
Goverment at work, keep it up MR
Yah but how did u blunder thru w/out a teleprompter or script to read. U speak like a child.

Quit now before it gets really embarassing.  It is coming.  Russia will be your undoing.
Okay guys, time for a brainstorming session. We're running out of way to fuck the poor. Ideas?
in your tacky gold chairs and tacky gold drapes. You've trashed the WH in more ways than one.
Happy to see nobody with their feet on the couch.
But this article is from the  @nytimes! You know they are the FAKE NEWS!
could you be any whiter?
a deflection hiding the chaos.
Trump is losing: Muslim ban, TrumpCare, sanity.
You want jobs, but 3million will be lost with the repeal of Obamacare. Um...??????????????????
The Republican "Study Committee?" 
Putins puppet lies about crowd size, being tapped, healthcare, biggest electoral win etc. etc. 0 credibility!!
