Info Warz Video from Inside President Doneld Trümps first intelligence briefing.
Trump is an habitual liar, racist, sexist, con artist, senile old man who will never be POTUS.
Only one thing left to say....the only good place for Trump hasn't been dug yet.  He's a waste of space & oxygen.
Trump supporters are bottom feeders....dull and vapid.  Trump will lose by a landslide. Two-party system is obsolete.
Governor of state is in said state
, you have a problem with that? A politician who actually cares about the people confuses you? You must be a democrat.
it's hilarious how much you'll generalize. You can't really label someone a leader for being in the state they govern
Trump sheep are so quick to come to the defense of their master. The Gov. of Indiana is in Indiana. Groundbreaking.
what would have been groundbreaking is if the president/ vice president would have been in Louisiana.
Trying to get the point across to these morons is tiring. Some people just weren't born with common sense.
And you're clearly one of them
just using the words Logical and Democrat together in your bio shows you don't have a clue. Those words are mutually exclusive.
unless you are gay or lesbian
Most Americans can't stand Trump.  Nobody is jealous of a con artist who made his money illegally.

@Dnald_Trump2016 @mike_pence 
Congratulation Mr. President Trump
after all he is the governor
If Pence is such a great leader, then he should be at the top of the ticket, not #trump.
Pence is/was the worst Governor in Indiana history. Plus he is a thief
more leadership than you ever had!
sorry this was an older post by President Elect Trump
@Dnald_Trump2016 @mike_pence d
why have you not addressed joe weichselbaum?
He IS the governor of Indiana so YES he should be there. Was this a sacrifice for him ?
We are good. No playdoh needed.
@SenatorSessions @rudygiulianiGOP @SheriffClarke @seanhannity @EricTrump @DanScavino
Thank you. Noble men touch God's heart and mind. Don't forget who created this beautiful earth.
please Mr President tell Obama to say ali bongo must give our deads that he killed we gonna bury them Gabonese are dying
Obama is still CIC. It's his duty to see that they get the help they need. Louisiana needs the help.
now that you mention it, does look like Trump has some black blood, doesn't it?  Need to look closet at that family tree. . .
You will make America great again when you lose and Mike Pence is out of Indiana.   That will be a great day!
Critics: REMOVE the doors/walls at home. Go to bed. Feel safe? Get it? TRUMP=SAFETY!
God bless n God be with Trump n mike pence
Did he remember to bring the play-doh?
WE THE PEOPLE want TRUMP&PENCE!   Maga man!  
nice he is helping people
. that is his job that's why he's our governor and I'm glad he's on your team to lose worst governor
great governor??? Are you kiddin me?? He signed a law making it legal to discriminate in his own state!!!
its not leadership, It is actually just him doing his job.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
Yes u made a great VP choice Mr.Trump
Appreciate that they are men of prayer. We're in spiritual battle w/evil!
Hillary's America
Beyond scary. I need 2 pray more/harder! & get angels of light--not darkness--out in force/Election Day!
His bedspread is a Nazi flag.
As an Indiana resident, let me state Pence is the farthest thing from "great." I'll be thrilled when he's gone.
prayers for the people in Indiana

Your VP nominee is a thief. Stole from his campaign fund to pay his mortgage. A real Christian my ass
pence is like the name implies: he is worth a pence, one penny crap
Hoosier born, Independent turned Republican this year and very proud to have Mike Pence on the ticket with you!
<3 08 / 27 & 28 / 16 <3  $ @mike_pence $
I told you trump u could learn a lot from Obama, now you using his policies to run a campaign.
but mike is standing with a racist Putin puppet traitor, YOU.   Believe me.
u mean the worst rated governor on the USA? #sad
@ElianaBenador @mike_pence your Campaign should stay offCNN and MSNBC the will not over fairly
He's the Governor of the state, isn't he? He's supposed to be there.
something you don't show
@seanspicer @mike_pence Indiana is glad to be rid of him.
Do you even remember what he looks like?
is it possible for you to find another #SMOKEandMIRROR word. We are all getting tired of #Great @realDonaldTrump @GOP #FAILURE @mike_pence
@USAneedsTRUMP @mike_pence Yup, he is a true leader.  Not just sitting around or playing golf.  America needs to see this.
@USAneedsTRUMP @mike_pence wow, very companionate TRUMP BRIGADE. HILARY BRIGADE ARE LIARS.
HA! Because you sure don't know how to help! He's the governor dummy! He has to!!!  SMH!
..well he IS their governor! That's his job.
@BeianNorma @mike_pence My prayers are with Mike Pence & Indiana! Dear Lord, lay your hands upon all people in Indiana &
give them peace as they
@realDonaldTrump @BeianNorma @mike_pence
- that's not his job...only a photo opp...all staged like you ..you're a FRAUD TRUMP
awesome
Never Trump
while you were spreading lies and fear! He should be the top of the ticket!

#welikemike #TrumpPence16 #MAGA
@gs777gs777 @mike_pence I like Pence. A keeper.
Shouldnt you be going there to unload boxes of play dough from a truck for 30 seconds?

how many days after tornado did he wait? Campaigned while people suffered, so sad, total loser
WoW - Fires n California, Floods n Louisiana, Earthquake n Italy, & now Tornadoes n Indiana~~~
That's his state numb nuts!
hahahahahahaha what a fucking douchenozzle jesus christ
More Play Doh?
or doing his job. Maybe that
that's great. No one should ever forget their original purpose. That's usually what gets you where you are.

I bet you wish you could emulate him.  At least he appears normal, more than we can say about you bigot.
oh great! I am glad to see this! Awesome! 
it's his job d*mbass.
Hoosiers can't stand Pence & were thrilled that you took that jackwagon off their hands.
I hope the folks in Louisiana appreciated the PlayDo.
True photo op.
That's what he's supposed to do!
It's his job!
mudflap - you can't have it both ways. Pence could have used the obama/hitlary defense to do nothing
It's his job. He's the governor of that state. That what he gets paid for.
tell that to obama. It works both ways, don't just vent your frustration because your guy lost
Obama doesn't have to go technically. It would be nice of him to do so but he doesn't have to.
whatever it takes to deny goodwill to GOP ticket I get it. Noted the RT from another cruzbot
@calRINOhunter
Pence is a joke just like Trump. He is a disgrace to America for partnering up with Trump. Never Trump/Pence
 #HillaryRules
His anti-science leadership in denying climate change may have been partially responsible for the tornado
bullshit
Gov Pence must be in IN, but we also need many more soundbites from him; we all want 2 hear more from him & U
Gov of LA asked PresObama 2 not visit BC 1st Responders needed 2save Ppl not secure road 4Pres 2 drive thru
Ummm, Donald, has Mike told you he lives there? Not so much leadership as doing his job. Seriously. Idiotic.
With no delays, good job Mike, right their for your state and Indianans
Are ya gonna bring em toys again?
U mean great leadership isnt playing golf in Martha's Vineyard like Pres Obama!
Leadership? He's the governor. It's sort of his JOB. No pats on the back for that.
great governor and Mike Pence can't be used in the same sentence
TRUMP/PENCE2016
awesome keep up the good work
America will not have a future if Trump is elected.
They want everything you've worked hard for as a private citizen & abused the power we gave them. #TrumpPence16 #VoteTrump
GOV PENCE excellent VP CHOICE. USA stands with GOV &ppl. Indiana.November TRUMP PENCE dynamic duo GOP LANDSLIDE
Ummmm... He's governor of that state and probably ought to be working on the behalf of his constituents.
Notice the absence of Obama & Hillary
WHY vote for Trump?
Hillary would go but check to Clinton Foundation from Louisiana victims- still in mail-when it clears.........
If you don't know Donald, that's his BASIC DUTY as Governor. He is not doing anything extraordinary. BRAGGER!!
it's time we put attention to real life! Thank you mike pence!
maybe you should learn something. But I don't think either one of u know any better. @HFA
Is he handing out Play-Doh too?
Taxes please ...........
that's right make pence do the real work U wouldn't even sit with him on plane to eat KFC had him sit in coach
That is what a great Governor does!
I think he's having second thoughts, about being your running mate. It's political suicide being associated with you.
Are you going to give away more Play Doh?
My buddies home was hit. Thank you. #TrumpPence16
I heard people say trumps nickname at school was sdd, stubby dick Donald is this true
Guess that was God's wrath for all the iniquity in Pency-poos state. He needs to get right with the Lord, obvs.
you both suck
.... You and Obama in Louisiana.
In the real world this means use up limited resources and get in the way of those who actually help. Like ....
He is the Governor there still.  So I suppose he might want to do his job.
@KatrinaPierson shut up
maybe you should go and help too  #Greatleadership
Bet he wasn't handing out play-doh like you did, and looking for the federal handouts too!!
let's hope none of them are gay. He will try to take their relief funding away and use it to "cure" them #loser
You mean the shlub did the job he gets paid to do................? 

#ManOfTheYear
he's very thoughtful
Of course Pence is in Indiana he is still governor. So don't make this a patriot move. How about Ohio.
@KatrinaPierson @mike_pence And if another tornado comes around pence is gonna punch it in the balls.
Meanwhile, Obama claims we're "standing with Columbia in building for peace." Um... We need that wall QUICK!!!!
#TeamTrump first responders in the lame duck session while "O" works on his swing.
@Amcboxer1 @mike_pence or capitalising on votes out of misery.I love shredded wheat
no one knows him and he is probably in the way. #realitystarcandidatespinningdrama
and where is Crooked Hillary? To sick to show up?
talk to the people of Indiana and they will tell you how great he isn't!
non mr trump someone work and pay taxes he or  she  should be  able to becoming us citizens no matter what
Isn't he the Governor? It's his job. Stupid tweet Donny.
@KatrinaPierson @mike_pence Play Dough for everyone!!!
Praying for Indiana.
Don't comment on HC's speech from today. She's trying to bait you to tweet. It's unfair.
little Mikey should stay away from here he's done enough damage when he left we threw a tailgate party
good man, good brother.. You too mr. donald your a nice man..
Way to go our Trump and Pence. You are for Americans.
he shpuld have been ready beforehand. Now its too late
hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha, nuff said.
mr  trump  u thinking humanly to not thinking about deported good human being

#Hillary has me in tears thinking about my family's future. She represents light and hope, #Trump darkness and hate. It's that simple.
any governor would do the same nothing special about Pence
unlike your pandering to cameras in Louisiana...and you think you're presidential...Hack!
Yeah that great Gov who would have been rejected if he ran again for Gov. Lying DT
my prayers are with them 
...by doing what is baseline required of the job as governor...yea....
SOUND THE TRUMPENCE 
WHILE HILLARY TRIES ON HIJAB PANTSUITS-JUSTIN CASH BOUGHT 
-HEY-WERE GONNA NEED MORE CASH
Sad indeed,, my prayer for you all.
Well, at least you remembered what state he's from...progress. #TrumpSoDumb
Why aren't you there Mr. Trump?  Because there is no true leadership with you all you can do is prey on others.
bible banging fanatic against women right to chose? You can keep Pence women will keep rights to their vaginas.
I feel bad for him in so many ways he has to defend you and your changing opinions
It's his State. He's supposed to be there.
If doing one's job is to be lauded as something special, we're sunk. @mike_pence
Mr Trump you made an Excellent choice picking Mr Pence!
I won't go near tornadoes ; murder on the comb-over. Sad!
