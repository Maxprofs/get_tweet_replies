#VeteransResist
#FBR
You're a liar. And a bad one.
I thought you said to Sen John McCain on TV that you don't consider soldiers who get captured are heroes...Hmmm. Hypocrite.
Tell that to Senator Songbird McCain.
The only Vietnam POW release at heavier weight.  http://cashmccall.com/songbird-mccain-white-obama-seeks-russian-hacking-sanctions/ …
I thought you liked people who weren't captured...
I agree with you, our POW/MIA are heroes. But, YOU are a traitor.
COMING FROM A FAMILY, SERVING IN MILITARY FOR GENERATIONS, THIS MEANS NOTHING @realDonaldTrump TIL YOU PUBLICLY APOLOGIZE TO @SenJohnMcCain!
Yes I agree. Members of my family have served in every war; since the American Revolution.
But...But...You said you only preferred people who weren't caught! Which is it???
The commandeering coward has no clue what he’s going on about. He comes out with that much bullshit, he forgets what he has already said. 
Hypocrites. All of em
This is the reality. You are a liar and disrespect military service. Just the Destroyer of order and decency.
You mean like @SenJohnMcCain, the same man you degraded and made fun of?
America won't forget our POWs & their sacrifice & incredible courage. 
Like John McCain. 
A true American patriot.
How did you feel when Trump said that he preferred soldiers that "didn't get caught"?

I thought you preferred soldiers who weren't captured?
Aren't you the one who said Senator McCain was not a hero (when we all know he is) because "I like people who didn't get caught"?
I thought you didn't like people who were captured? Show the world you mean it and apologize to @SenJohnMcCain and all other POWs. #manup
Did you forget about this already??? Not too surprising
This from the guy who attacked McCain because "he doesn't like people who were caught"
Like hero John McCain
I thought you didn't like those "captured" kind?
But you don't like people who are captured right?
I thought you didn't like they ones who were caught? #fakepotus
Wait - I thought your heroes didn't get captured.
Huh. 
Remember, that one time?
When you blasted McCain for getting captured? 
I do. 
We all do. 
That was shitty.
Hey, Pres., if you get a chance, see Mel Gibson's movie, Hacksaw Ridge - one of the greatest movies of military heroism, ever!
Many of our Vietnam Veterans were left behindno closureonly questions and overwhelming grief
So why did you say John McCain was no hero because he got caught? Do you ever listen to yourself?  Your instability is frightening!
"I like people who weren't captured." -Donald Trump
#AlsoNotForgotten
After what you said about John McCain- this statement makes me laugh- all the way to impeachment!  Trump is a bad, bad joke.  No honor! 
Unseal @SenJohnMcCain Vietnam War records! Songbird should be in #Prison NOT the US Senate! #WarCriminal got OUR Soldiers killed! #NoHero

Says the man who mocked @SenJohnMcCain  Where is YOUR sacrifice @realDonaldTrump
You understand it's to late to save yourself right? You can't let RUSSIA PUT YOU IN OFFICE & expect us to allow you to remain there!
I thought you preferred people who don't get captured... #fatloser
Wait, I thought you liked people who didn't get captured?
Hypocrite! You told #FrankLuntz that soldiers who are captured are not heroes in reference to @SenJohnMcCain. Make your mind up #Lyingtrump
You mean like JOHN MCCAIN?
Yeah.  But you like the ones who didnt get captured.  Isnt that what you said about McCain?  Mr Deferment.
Then I guess you owe Sen McCain a HUGE apology, right? DO IT. You were 100% wrong & juvenile. We're waiting
Yes, but you don't like soldiers who get caught, so why support POW-MIA? I guess u were lucky not to get caught. But then how could u DODGER
“He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

Have you lost your mind?! You claimed you only like soldiers who aren't captured! Putting McCain down!! People don't forget your hypocrisy!
Can U spell JOHN MCCAIN? Do U even remember who John McCain is? Do U know what day it is anymore? But I'll bet U know who Robert Mueller is
Like @SenJohnMcCain that you always disrespect?
But um,  didn't you say you liked heros who WEREN'T CAPTURED?  Like say, JOHN MCCAIN?
I thought you liked soldiers that didn't get captured?
I'm confused. I thought you didn't like the ones that got captured. That's what you said about McCain, wasn't it?
Remember when you said you like people who didn't get captured?
I assume this includes John McCain?
Didn't you say you preferred the guys who didn't get caught when you were bashing Senator McCain? Now all of the sudden you respect POWs?
guess now he also likes the guys that did get captured
I thought you liked people who didn't get captured?
except John McCain, right?
Thank you for remembering sir! Maga
Always
I thought you preferred people who didn't get captured...

I'm proud to be an American
If you hate America, name a country you'd rather live in...then move there. Bye
#GodBlesstheUSA 
You said you liked people who weren't captured. What are we supposed to believe? Donald then or Donald now?
Hillary could never honor this day
How's your heel spur? #deferment
It is okay on the golf course, but otherwise???

Sadly! Rahm Emmanuel Mayor of Obama's city ..great job 4 Dems as always!  NOT!
So just to clarify, you like the missing ones but not the captured ones?
45 is a pathetic excuse for a human being.  #NotMyPresident
From a draft dodger.
I thought he only liked war heroes who didn't get caught.

https://youtu.be/7k1ajHAeXMU  #LyingHypocrite
Notable among them @SenJohnMcCain whose heroism and service you mocked. Your own lack of service combined with that is truly #Deplorable .
I thought you only like the ones that weren't captured?! Remember @SenJohnMcCain!?
http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317 …. Something is seriously wrong with you! #MuellerIsComing #SundayMorning
Thought you didn't like people who were captured. You said they're not heroes.
You said you don't like soldiers who got captured and made fun of John McCain.  You insulted our POWs.  Do you ever mean anything you say?
Thought you preferred heroes that were not captured.  You said it.  Or are you a hypocrit?  #impeachTrumpnow
I thought you didn't like people that got caught? #mccainisahero
you mean like the "loser" @SenJohnMcCain you referred too?  You insult one of USA greatest Heroes u don't get to post ur fake empathy.
So you've changed your mind?
Remember saying you prefer when soldiers aren't captured re: McCain? I prefer presidents that AREN'T pieces of shit.
Like Senator McCain, who you refused to call a hereo bc he was captured. You ability to suck at everything is truly incredible. Hate you
apologize to John McCain for saying he's not a hero because he was caught and we might accept what you said here.
We don't!  However, Im going to remind you everyday that DACA is a Big Fraud and we are not buying into it!  #NoDACADeal #NoAmnesty

Thank you Sir!! With all the issues going on with all the ass clowns   trying to block/disrupt your administration, like no other President
Wait, I thought you said John McCain was no hero?
You mean TRUE HEROES like John McCain who was captured?
In my eyes, Senator McCain is a true shining example of bravery.
Love that man.
@realDonaldTrump aren't you the abusive Knucklehead who put down John McCain for getting captured!
Yeah, he is. I just wrote him to ask that he apologize to McCain, but alas, don't think he will. He doesn't really like 'losers,' you know?
It is his nature not to apologize! Too many yes men telling him how right he is! Feeding his ego and paranoia!
Didn't say that to McCain, did you? No, you embarrassed him, called him a loser for being a POW. You need to apologize to him 4 being tacky.
U were being polite he was an absolute JERK!
Hard to be polite, but I try. It falls on deaf ears with him anyway.
So why did u say Senator John McCain was no hero? Your heroes aren't captured!! Now just sayin it doesn't take away your previous hate!
I thought you like the ones who "weren't captured".
Aren't you the same person that said about Senator McCain that you like people that weren't captured?
MCCAIN SURE DID 
Rip
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxwR9kCbZ0 …. 

Funny how this video contradicts nearly everything you say about our military.
https://youtu.be/Rm6xL0klXcQ   Mr President, you should be ashamed of your self,...again.  #incrediblyfullofshit
Are you FUCKING kidding me? After what you said about McCain & POWs? You're going to do that? Are you serious? Right in front of my salad?!
McCain is not one of those heros in my book...
God Bless all the military personnel who are missing in action or are deceased.
#POW #MIA Always on my mind & in my heart #USA 
I though that you didn't like heroes that got captured.
Hypocritic is too kind a word to use to describe you. NEVER FORGET what you said about John McCain.
Yes, thank you John McCain.
I thought you preferred people who weren't captured.  You said POWs aren't heros.
Not the canary McCain though 
 Fire killed too many John. Apologize you can still become a man.
Indeed, Agreed. 
God Bless our USA veterans overseas, their forever missed; always loved, and never forgotten.
I am a vet thank you for everything I hope we can bring them all home soon
Thought you didn't like people who got caught? Thought they weren't heroes? ???
Weren't you the one that disrespected our POWs and said you like the veterans that "didn't get caught"....yep pretty sure you said that
Except for John McCain. You can forget him.
You should have specifically honored John McCain.
You dodged the draft.  You're a Russian puppet.  You're losing support by the day.  Your administration is failing.  Your downfall is nigh.
But will gladly forget McCain- nothing more than a self-grandiose traitor!!!!
But not John McCain...right?
Funny you called OUR HERO JOHN MCCAIN A LOSER BECAUSE HE WAS CAPTURED. U SAID YOU ONLY LIKE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T http://CAUGHT.YOU  SUCK
Did you tell them about your bone spurs?  You've got a lot of nerve addressing the military when you avoided service at all costs....wimp.
but @realDonaldTrump you said @JohnMcCain wasn't a hero...
Unlike #TraitorJohnMCain who thwarted any efforts to bring Our POW s home. @senJohnMcCain  is a true   Traitor to the USA.
Like POW John McCain, you called him 'not a Hero!' Which one is it, Sybil?
Do you think McCain being BROKEN! by the Viet Cong has continued to make him both paranoid and Marxist?  He ran as Republican yet... nope.
"I like the soldiers that don't get caught! Ok?"
@realDonaldTrump you mean like Senator @SenJohnMcCain?  Didn't you denounce his POW experience?
You mean like Senator McCain???
I thought you only liked those who weren't captured. #Hypocrite
Wait, what? I thought you preferred people who weren't captured. Didn't you say that?
NEVER forget what Trump said “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”
I thought POWs were losers according to you? Figure out one story and stick with it.
lol throwback to when you mocked John McCain specifically FOR his POW status #asshat
Oh you mean like to honor @Sen. John McCain as a HERO!
Thank u 4 never forgetting many who have long forgotten those who never returned to America. U are true PATRIOT 2 AMERICA GOD BLESS U & ALL
July 18 2015 TRUMP says: "He was [called] a war hero because he got captured! He's NOT a WAR HERO.  I like people who WEREN'T captured."
. I thought you only like the ones who don't get caught?
But you said that people who have been captured aren't heroes, remember? We do.
You are a LIAR!

Like Sen. McCain? You know, when you said you like ppl who don't get captured? Hypocrite. Unfit to be Pres. #resist
Like McCain?? Remind everyone what you said about him?
You seem to never forget to mock, dishonor, degrade, & strip them of their benefits & retirement. Our heroes would prefer you shut it.  
You hate people who were captured. They were losers, remember?
Thank you for posting this,  Trump staffer.
Why didn't you say this instead of your slam  where you disrespected  POW's saying that you liked those who were never captured'
How hypocrite of showboat @realDonaldTrump. Yup any of them had more courage & fulfilled their oath. In a cowardly fashion you deferred.
Looks like you officially owe Senator McCain a public apology now more than ever... do you have the balls, Don?
Didn't you say you like guys who aren't captured?
One example... John McCain. Oh wait, you said you didn't like heroes that got caught...?? Which is it? You're being hypocritical AGAIN!
I thought you only liked people who were not captured…?
NEVER forget that you blamed those HEROES for "getting caught" you unpatriotic PoS.
Is this an apology to @SenJohnMcCain? Oh excuse me. You don't do apologies. Instead does this mean you are taking back what you said before?
Except for Senator McCain who you stated was not hero because he was captured. #eatyourwords
Except of course draft avoiding Buffoon POTUS "likes people who weren't captured".  What an embarrassment. #theworldislaughingatyou
Uh. What was it u said about John McCain Such a hypocritical idiot
I thought you preferred soldiers that "weren't captured"? 
I thought you only like war heroes who "didn't get captured"???
I thought you didn't like soldiers who were captured??  
I thought you didn't like people who were captured.
There are 3 Americans being held in North Korea today. Have you ever mentioned them?
"I feel like a great & really brave soldier."   ~Donald Trump
(or "Spurs" as they called him in college)
You like soldiers who don't get captured.
I thought you liked people that weren't captured?
The ones without the bone spurs. You spineless coward
Thought you didn't like "losers" that got captured?  America will not forget you said this to John McCain.  Trump is a LOSER! A YUUUGE ONE!
Wait, didn't you call @SenJohnMcCain a "loser" for being captured?
Wasn't he the one who said McCain isn't a hero because he was captured & made prisoner? He said he "likes his heroes not captured". Fuckwit
What about what you said about John McCain losers get caught in war impeachment for you
Nice sentiment but...
#WaffleWaffleWaffle 
#YouAreOnNoticePOTUS
I thought you preferred heroes who did not get captured?? Your words, not mine.
I thought they were losers shitwit.
So when did you change your tune about soldiers that were captured? You go whichever way you think will keep you popular.
WTAF? Unless you're John McCain? #POS
"I like people who weren't captured" -- Donald Trump 

#moronpotus
I thought you only liked the ones who didn't get caught.  So hypocritical!
Like John McCain? Thought you didn't like captured heroes. Was it bone spurs, oh right--kept you from being a hero.
Makes you wonder why you said what you did about Senator McCain. You make me sick. #minoritypresident
Hypocrite! Your remark re John McCain will never be forgotten by those of us who have served. You can best serve your country by resigning.
You mean like McCain?
