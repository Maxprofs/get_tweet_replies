Sure, he will press the Trump button and say, "Let there be Trump's Great America," and America will be great again.
He would do nothing of the kind.  He would WRECK the economy! His policies are inanely simplistic and will fail!
Trump’s plans add $5.3 trillion to the debt! Off course it will make Trump personally richer!! As trump said he loves debt!
Trump=end of civilization
