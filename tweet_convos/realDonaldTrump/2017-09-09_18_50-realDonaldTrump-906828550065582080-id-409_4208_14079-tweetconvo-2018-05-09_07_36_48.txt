Where can I find information for friends and others desperate for assistance in St. John? Thank you
US citizens needing assistance in US territories following #HurricaneIrma should register at http://disasterassistance.gov 
They have no Internet/Wi-Fi, cell service, power. Rare opportunity for a phone call once. Another option? They are in dire need.
They can contact local emergency services or Red Cross.  Police in St John: 1-340-693-8880. St. Croix.
Tracy Swanson Guzik  Mark Guzik and Bailey Swanson Guzik all on Dutch St Maarten
Have you submitted their full info using one of the options below?
How about the Virgin Islands? Our citizens need help! There is no food or water and they are getting  desperate.
are you in the British or US Virgin Islands?
Any updates?
Please continue to use this contact information to notify us of US citizens overseas in need of help. http://ow.ly/GT3V30f2fxa 
you mean, like Relatives?  to notify relatives of an injury or death?
To clarify - info about US citizens known to be in overseas areas affected by hurricanes who may need assistance.

At least you notified North Dakotans that they are better off with their drought since Fla and Tx are drowning in water.
Where's your 1MIL donation? Or, was that just a lie, too - like everything you say?
Mr. President, WE don't want DACA. Please don't sign it into LAW. Thank you, Sir. Don't Compromise on this ISSUE. STOP SAYING YOU ARE SORRY.

I'm curious if the hurricane could be caused from Korea  cooling their nuclear reactor power plants with sea water.
If an oceans boiler room is heated to over 27 deg it may cause hurricanes.
Sounds silly however Florida is only 7500 miles from Korea
My Thoughts and Prayers are with my beloved ones that have been affected by Hurricane Irma in Florida, stay safe & God with them!
