*fence

It won't be a wall, and WHY do you need money for it if Mexico is paying for it like you promised?!
Also, the fence won't stop drugs. They can still easily tunnel under it as they've already been doing with Obama's border wall. Also, drones
& as always, you lied about Obama's impact on this. He deported almost all of MS 13 & you want to take credit.
How about you focus more on the issues that actually impact our safety like health care instead of a silly border fence?
You keep forgetting that REPUBLICANS have a MAJORITY in both the House & the Senate. THEY are the ones saving us from your stupid FENCE.
Obama's wall has worked perfectly fine keeping us safe. We need to spend that money on health care & implement a single payer system.
I know you still have some supporters (which amazes me), but millions have woken up to your lies. Your first 100 days have been a disaster.
Maybe fulfill ONE, SINGLE promise of yours & then the Republicans who are blocking your fence may trust u more? We're fine in the meantime…


I'll give you points for that one, Mags, I don't agree with it but it's bloody funny all the same
Sovereign Nations have borders. #BuildTheWall
So you'll build one on the Canadian side too?
Is there an influx of Canadian illegal immigration I somehow missed?
Common sense dictates you build and secure where there's a problem.
common sense dictates you try to solve problems, not isolate every country.
Borders work. We can't solve Mexico's problems for them.
Borders work? Like Berlin? Or a recent one - Israel?
Anyhow this is a question of funding, where he said Mexico will pay, now blaming dems.
Yeah like Mexico built a wall recently to stop Central America's illegal immigrants.
No.
The Democrats don't want money from the budget going to the border wall because YOU PROMISE MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT.
#SundayMorning
Your budget slashes money from programs benefiting the poorest.
You tax plan gives money to the richest.
This is not sustainable.
#AMJoy
BTW: We haven't forgotten.
Show us your taxes.
Or will they prove your ties to Russia?
#TrumpRussia
#SundayMorning
#AMJoy
Your proposed budget is like your tax plan and the healthcare plan and your Muslim ban:

Not going to happen.
#SundayMorning
#AMJoy
Are Uday and Qusay still on their hunting trip, killing prairie dogs?
#SundayMorning
#AmJoy
Your approval rating has bottomed out at 40%.
Your #First100Days have been a disaster.
The world is laughing at you.
At us.

Fox News poll?
Really? 
That's like going to the Flat Earth Society yearly meeting and ask them if they still think the earth is flat.
Nobody wants to fund your stupid wall, don't blame the democrats.
The democrats don't want a war. They want affordable healthcare, programs for seniors. Help for homeless. Spend money on real issues.
Instead of wasting millions of dollars promoting your ridiculous hotels and resorts on taxpayer money while saying we can't afford PBS.
Or blowing up millions of dollars to try and distract from your Russia scandal.
Stop pointing fingers and own up to your inadequacy. You will never get better if you don't open your eyes and see you are actually failing.

The leftward shift we've seen on this issue from Democrats is interesting. It's gone from bipartisan, to a polarizing issue.
Ultimately though, if you want funding for your "wall" Donald, you should be sure you cut funding elsewhere to pay for it...
because it doesn't look like Mexico is cutting that check.
Pappas. A Greek Orthodox Christian? Disgrace to the Orthodox Faith. Go to Greece and FIGHT ISIS where they are taking over you fool....
1. I'm not Orthodox.
2. I'm only 1/8th Greek, and more German and Anglo-Saxon
3. I'm American, not a Greek citizen
4. Bug off
I'm twice as Greek as you.  Still not very Greek.
We R about to face a HOLY WAR! EVIL vs Good. Islam is in your back yard & U liberals HAVE NO CLUE who Obama is. WAKE UP & GROW UP!
You could use 1/10,000th of the money and save meals on wheels
You can do a whole lot more good with $20 billion than building a useless wall
Its all about fear.
We're paying a half million a day for Melania to live in NYC but, considering the alternative, we don't blame her.
1/ I'm a @GOP member & I don't want you spending our money INEFFECTIVELY.
Opioids = worst drug problem, half come from prescriptions. …
2/Illegal opioids coming on planes from China, not walked over border from Mexico. Mexican immigration has been negative for years.
3/40% of illegal immigrants arrive by air on a legal visa & overstay. Wall does NOTHING.
You're a #taxandspendrepublican if u build.
4/So what happened to your joke of a  campaign promise that Mexico would pay for the wall? @EPN put that to bed FAST.
#nodeal @VicenteFoxQue
Many Republicans don't either. And you promised Mexico would pay. You weren't honest.
Obama led the nation in passion. You lead in fear. Sorry but Americans want healthcare and better wages...not your fearful agenda.

Perhaps it's because you ran on the promise that Mexico would pay for the wall and they don't want to be facilitators of a falsehood.

It's a boondoggle, just like your entire Presidency. And WE have to pay for it.
Remember Mexico was going to pay? Why do you never stop lying?
Criminalizing pot as strong as they want to will only strengthen the gangs as well.
What does that even mean "criminalizing pot as strong as they want"? Who wants it? It's already legal in many US states.
Do your research, trump wants higher restrictions and "greater enforcement of it"
Yes. Greater enforcement was how Ronald & Nancy won the war.
Ronald and Nancy didn't win a thing re drugs. Education, treatment have way better results (look at the Netherlands).
Recognizing sarcasm is a key to Twitter.
Spend the money on drug prevention then! #SundayMorning
MS13 gang members have been in this country for decades.  They come from here not Mexico! #SundayMorning
Originated in El Salvador. #NOFUCKINGWALL
Democrats don't want money from budget going to border walls because $21.6 billion dollars could be spent in a thousand better ways.
Didn't Obama spend $21.6 Billion playing Golf with his "entourage?"
If he did, then Mr Trump must be spending more since he's playing way more golf
He plays for FREE, he OWNS the Golf Course!
Right. And the huge jet he takes to go to Florida and the security contingent and so forth?
You really think the club fees are the expensive bit when the President plays golf?
You see Trump and Family Jetting off on Vacations to Hawaii and Martha's Vineyard constantly?
No, I see him flying to Mar-a-lago every single week. I see his wife living in New York at huge expense to the tax payer.
Not sure how closely you follow technological breakthroughs, but scientists have developed something calls "TUNNELS."
They're underground passageways. So it's like being above ground, but you're below the ground. That way you can under things on the ground.
Do you really think he doesn't have a plan for that? Would he build a skyscraper and forget the windows? #MAGA
What's the plan for smuggling via boats?
IDK, in not part of that planning, are you?
As a concerned native born American citizen, I respectfully request to have my opinion heard. Whether you like it or not! #TheResistance 
Weeks got your mouth taped? Looks like it's working to me.
I have no idea what you're talking about! So you must be trolling. Thanks for the entertainment, I'm out! I love  Twitter!!! 
If you weren't somehow POTUS you'd be the rightist troll everyone blocks because he never says anything insightful at all.
@billmitchellvi but less amusing.

Never forget, size DOES matter!
Only a tiny percentage come over the border. Most enter legally on a visa. Like your Taj Mahal, your wall is a stupid money pit.
We have more bad hombres here! People actually born here! Wow! He is so F,ed up!
You said Mexico would pay for it, you liar. Why do you lie all the time?
They will.
Lol yeah, right after the pigs fly by my window. You've been taken by a con man.
Not only are we going to pay for it, we're likely to pay for it twice, once up-front, again when they raise prices to compensate for the tax
Making America great by forcing Americans to spend all their money on a boondoggle!
I'm setting up a ladder sales company in Mexico, along the boarder, no brainer.
I'll set up the shovel sales company.
I'll be the salesman, deal??? 
Democrats don't want money from the budget going to the border wall because you promised Mexico would pay for it
It's hard to blame Democrats when it's not just Democrats who are pushing back on funding a wall http://thehill.com/homenews/house/317011-border-district-republicans-skeptical-about-trumps-wall?amp …
"A growing number of congressional Republicans are objecting to the cost and viability" of a border wall https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/02/03/politics/border-wall-republicans/index.html …
Well they need to stop being the problem and start being the solution, most of their campaign was on building the wall.
I will not pay for a stupid wall when there are children hungry and sick in the USA!
Sounds good, let's get cracking on both.
Yeah I'm sure gangs are going to see a wall and just turn around. They already respect the fence by not digging a tunnel under it, right?
dontrump has Ruski ties
don's illegit & full of lies
don's admin full of spies
Russian ties around his neck
He sold us out
What the heck?
Any evidence of trump and Russia ties???
#AverageDeplorable
It is an icon of intellectual impotence.
You do realize they're digging tunnels right?
The Democrats want you to keep your campaign promise. 

Mexico will pay for your stupid wall.

Another failed Trump campaign promise...
I'm a Dem and I don't want him to keep ANY of his campaign promises.
But you promised the American taxpayer they wouldn't have to pay for it.
No, it's because you proclaimed Mexico is paying for it, you buffoon
your kind
Damn right. Reagan was a monster & 45 is one too.
You promised - hundreds of times - that we wouldn’t pay a penny for your wall. 

Now you want taxpayer money.

You’re a giant fail machine.
"Giant fail machine". Def my favorite part
YOU SAID AMERICA WOULDN'T PAY FOR IT
BUT the American taxpayers have been paying for NOT having a barrier on our south border. $110BILL a year goes to strife caused by illegals
How much goes to subsidize Walmart employees?
I don't follow the basis for your question.
Doesn't surprise me that you can't comprehend the question.
Gerry, does that mean you can't explain it to me either? Do Walmart employees get "subsidized?"
While Walmart continues to make ridiculous profits American tax payers support their employees. Research it and I guaranty you'll be pissed
But Mexico is gonna pay for it. Believe me.
they will.

Do you know how it works? He can easily cut trades with them or even have them pay for entering the country.
I imagine Mexico increasing the cost on what they sell here also.
well due to the government there being run by cartels, anything is possible #MakeMexicoGreatAgain
Right, so why would the cartels help build something that would cut their income? Kinda counterintuitive really
Lets hope Mexico changes base on their opposition towards Trump
"Who's gonna pay for the wall?"
"Mexico! ...Wait, actually us! ...Wait, actually no one because this president can't accomplish anything!"
Democrats don't want to spent hundreds of billions of dollars on a defense system then can be thwarted by a ladder
Every single member of Congress representing a southwest border district opposes your border wall funding request.

DEMOCRATS & REPUBLICANS.
Pretty sure u said Mexico paying for that wall not Americans, political affiliations aside
You sound like you just woke up from a coma that you've been in since 1986.
Trump is using lies & fear 2 fulfill campaign rhetoric & stoke racial divides. 45 is trying 2 take America back 2 a dark time N our history
So you are for illegal aliens who slaughter Americans, violent gangs, drug cartels etc? (or are you just girly whining for fun?)
Too right! You said Mexico would pay, you maniac.
EAT A SNICKERS!
It won't stop anything.  It would be just a big racist waste of money.
It serves as a symbol of race-based fear and hatred masquerading as a way to fix a non-existent problem.
Latinos, obviously.  Pretending a crime problem exists from Mexican immigration creates animosity toward Latinos.
It's still racist despite the ambiguous categorization of Latinos.
Remember #Trump's wall? Nothing going to happen. We'll tear it down faster than he can build it.

Also you have a majority Republican congress now, if stuff can't get passed it has very little to do with Democrats
He's not the brightest candle on the cake. Stick to something you might know how to do: Stick to golfing. Governance isn't your thing!
Legalize and regulate drugs. Now your wall is just for 100 people.
More fake news but the dumb uneducated druggies will believe it smh
I'm citing Fox and Breitbart. Are they fake news? Is Trump wrong about them? Tell me.
When are you going to stop telling these rediculus lies Mr Trump. Your wall will not stop drugs from entering the United States. There are plenty of ways other than our shared boarder with Mexico that those snuggling drugs into the US use. To say otherwise is complete loonacy.
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHERE MS13 is originally from EL SALVADOR NOT MEXICO!! Learn your history Mr President
You want to waste $25 billion on border wall funds in spite of the fact it won't, but don't let facts get in the way of your dog whistles.
build the wall then electrify it!!!!
Then we should start with you.  Electrify you.
I'm so glad I'm not you are you even legal?
1.  @realDonaldtrump @USSenate @KamalaHarris @DianeFeinstein @NRA Nothing will stop drugs! Like gun violence. Per yr cronies "NRA" say ppl kill each other not guns. Ppl choose to use drugs:
Not just Democrats. No one on the border wants to pay for your dumb wall.
Texans don't want Trump's border wall or mass deportations, a new poll found http://www.newsweek.com/border-wall-not-good-idea-texans-insist-poll-587573 …

You could provide 20 sources and they'll be *fake or slanted*. That's the new rebuttable to anything.
They won't even listen to Texans like me say "heck no we don't want a wall". Bunch of Trump bots.
How will this stop drugs? Are they floating through the air? Do drugs walk themselves?
I suspect the Democrats are more concerned with making sure taxpayer money isn't squandered on useless gestures
MS 13 is a Los Angeles gang. They didn't come from Mexico. MS 13 is an American export. 

You know nothing.
yes, they are international now but they are from los angeles. Without immigration they wouldn't be in el salvador
Yup. The wall will solve all evils..Bad bad democrats 4 not spending 21.6 Billion $$ on it! I believe u Donald. Ur always so right.

Build the wall!!!
Thank you Mr.  President.
No, a border wall would not significantly curb drug smuggling https://www.factopolis.com/claims/border-wall-would-significantly-curb-drug-smuggling/ …
What about those school shootings, church shootings, the Vegas shooting. Massive number of deaths done by whites doing all this rapes pedophiles most are whites the wall will not stop them we will be locked in here with them. Just walk away already your a disgrace to this country
You are elected as President and your job is to create a safe environment for all Americans and this is the laws you have to uphold by all legals means. Stay strong President Trump we are behind you!
of course the democrats fighting tooth and nail to keep the illegals here.they need the votes and that is there biggest voting block.
EVERY IMMIGRANT CASE IS DIFFERENT... Exactly why we say our immigration system is broken... Please help those who's family needs a fighting chance... Every aspect of the immigration system is broken and needs to be addressed
Let the CITIZENS start a GOFUNDME to fund the wall. Democrats are willing to sacrifice the safety of the country's citizens to augment their defunct voter base due to their corruption.  this is OUR country. BUILD the WALL and DEPORT ALL ILLEGALS. MAGA; God Bless
The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS...
... that you, Mr Trump, are definitely NOT a genius by any stretch of the imagination.
And the same goes for those who are members of the Salvadorian gang MS-13. We have hundreds of miles of shorelines Mr Trump. Have you never heard of smugglers using boats to get their cargo, drugs &/or human, into this country.
This argument of your's proves beyond any doubt ...
They want to open USA to global land and we can't support the world. America is first.
They do not want to stop the billions of dollars in illegal drugs coming over the border! WHY?
obamas liberal policies have weakened alot of america ..
Of course they don't....they can't get the votes they need otherwise and might lose their cushy jobs.  BUILD the WALL, NO DACA, NO anchor babies, NO chain migration, NO lottery.
, Mr.President thank you. The wall will save hundreds of  lives(illegal immigrants). They DIE IN THE DESERTS. REMIND THE demoncrats they preached it in the past!
No, it won't. Those "bad hombres" are smarter than you.
not all Americans are so forgiving when an eleagle kills a loved one. Can they take revenge on a demacrap to soothe sorrow
You pay for it you can have it..... Your weekend vacations cost us to much!!!
: Democrats ist Leere Köpfe..
Empty heads !
Anita: The Wall will not stop drugs, where there's a demand, those drugs will be delivered. As far as MS13, treat them like ISIS. MD
Release your taxes
What about the gang members who are already here?
their is no money in the budget ! You gave it to to your rich friends!!
Please don't let the Democrats win this. We need protection and we need to get the Refugees out of our country
@TrumpWhiteHouse what about the drugs here in our country how dare you keep saying they all come Mexico your wrong
Question:  How come the U.S. and the States haven't moved their military encampments/bases to the border?...two birds with one stone!
That's because you said Americans would NOT pay a cent for it! #TrumpLyingAgain
As you know mr President the democrats are the problem in America keep on fighting
Independents such as myself don't want the wall either.
They profit from the misery they cause
They would rather fund their corrupt Swamp with it then protect our citizens, that's a democrat for you!
Wall is stupid and will cost on the backs of poor people!!! Fact
Donnie, I thought you said that Mexico was going to pay for the wall.
GROW UP & GET OVER PARTY LINES. YOU SHOULD BE UNITING OUR COUNTRY NOT PITTING US AGAINST EACH OTHER. EDUCATE YOURSELF PLS.
wtf
#NoFlyZone4Rojava
Build The Frigging Wall! and then Throw the Dems on the other side!
#BuildTheWall
WRONG
no a wall won't stop them. They have tunnels and most drugs come in through legal crossing you are fake news!
Just once would you think before you open your mouth.
Dems not dumb, that cash going into trump pockets,, our nation in debt we dont need wall
Yes, definitely no way those guys would be able to get past a wall.
Sorry if any of this offends you but your thinking is illogical.
Because they have been bringing drugs into the US and making huge money from it.
you need to gather all drug money collected in all states and use it and get rid of Pelosi,schumer, Obama, soros,clinton,et
fuck yeah  build  it get  the  drugs  off my  streets
Throughout your campaign,  you fucking said that "Mexico will pay for it"!!! If UR breaking your word, why not break the whole idea?
Trump there things you need to learn drugs in gang members only in Mexico  not I don't know where you got that I dear
- I agree! They continue to vilify you rather than unify the nation!
Didn't you said MEXICO was paying 4 it? #SexualPredator #LiarInChief
The Democrats are more sensible than you mate. The wall is very expensive to build and it should be spent on more important things! #Trump
I'm from an MS-13 hotspot.  You don't know SHIT about them.
If it were that easy smh
apparently you dont want money for wall either your willing to wait instead of confronting president ryan,ms13 and drugs must not be to bad
show them real evidence instead of rhetoric. You promised Mexico would pay for the wall and now they're not.Give people a reason to believeU
Dear Mr. Trump if the bad guys want in they can just board a fast boat and land at any Gulf coast state or along Fla. coast
The Dems need their drugs! That's why!
Walls do nothing to stop drugs, for proof, see Border Tunnels. Also coastlines, trucks, planes etc..No we are not building a monument to you
Wrong. The Democrats don't want u forcing tax payers 2 pay for the wall or 2 shut down funding 4 the poor or the sick.
Your a liar. US Guns kill thousands. White males are the #1 terrorist group in the US. And you want to waste money on a wall lol
SHUT IT DOWN! Corrupt Federal Government is the source of USA problems.
bs
?
Stop bowing to the democrats!show the republicans how to stand !
Yeah, get a wall, a hammer to hit Kim Jung Un in the head, and a Man Cave to solve today's problems your own way, fossil-child.
You said Mexico is going to pay for it! Now you want the US public to pay for the wall. Sad Liar!!
Why haven't you done anything about the MS 13 gang members already in this country?
Build it!!
D-Tru, MS13 is already established here in the States. Tucson has had them here for decades School of Americas trained them
Of course they don t ...it s the right thing..have all your supporter send 10$...that should do it..
A wall slush fund
The wall must be built-that is non-negotiable. Why should POTUS & GOP give concessions to them? They lost. We have spoken
Why are judges acting as dictators.they don't live n the areas were we live and we want #AmericaSafe..We need judges to obey the law #MAGA
MS13 was originated in LA & had nothing to do w Mexico.they were Salvadorians,Hondurans & Guatemalans.Canada has an influx,wall there too?
Instead of more ICE raids,wall-beef up gang units where they r located.catch them tht way-if immigrants send them off. If citizens, prison
The "drugs" wouldn't be sought aft if we target the biggest drug issue-Pharm co here w lax rx standards.ppl get hooked on rx MEDS,then turn
To illegal crap made here/wherever.Perhaps goal of combating opiate abuse is the sensible place to start-then u hve no "lookers" for other
The Pharm co that gave to ur campaign is the place to start.or will u blame Canada since they are legalizing MJ?Tht will flow here.Easy fix
Use the money (pay/income) that you're going to donate for whatever you deemed.
It's because 1)wall is WRONG 2)better uses - like infrastructure or funding community programs 3)you're a traitor 4) you're a traitor ...
Mexican aren't the only ones dealing drugs  if the wall goes up there will still be drugs over here!
they will probably vote for a raise for themselves again too.  They only care for their pockets and not American People

Legalize drugs and solve your problem. The wall will stop nothing. Absolute waste of money
How do you think the Dems stay in business!!!!
You plan = very bad. Your conscience =very bad. Your presidency = very bad for all of us. Get it? #donthecon #Impeach45 #liarinchief
Veto the budget.
The good still suffer for the bad.  Why not focus on better mental health care?God forbid save our kids with the wall money @Julian4Justice
Which party controls congress?
It's funny that you actually believe this.
Cause ms 13 isn't already hear wtf
A wall will not stop any of that. Tunnels, planes, cars, walkovers are the real paths. #FearMonger #ignorant #Dunce #Drumpf
BECAUSE U SAID MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT YOU EGOTISTICAL SOCIOPATH!
Set up a citizens' fund for the wall! A lot of people will donate to #BuildThatWall. BTW, we ALL know that Mexico will pay via trade deals.
Spend the money on out infrastructure!!! The wall will stop NOTHING!!!
