You are a goddamn idiot
In this instance he is right
Thank you!  So many have died.  A ceasefire is a great step forward, if both sides will adhere to it.  Our enemy is ISIS!
You cannot negotiate anything with Putin. He's a master manipulator who cannot be trusted under any circumstances.
Trump working with Putin on cyber security is like working with OJ  Simpson on finding Nicole's killer.
No, @JeffTutorials, we don't. That's why his approval rating is in the toilet. Bc he's getting nothing done & is a complete disgrace to .
Unfortunately he's getting a lot done through EOs, appoints, tweets, regs etc. what he doesn't say is sending hate crimes through the roof.
What is he getting done? Trump said governing by executive orders shows incompetence. The man tells so much lies it boggles the mind.
"Defeat Isis"... such a brilliant EO.  Why didn't Obama think of that???
Trump has done nothing. He executes Obama's plan, if he fails he blames Obama if it succeeds he takes credit. The man is very astute con man
I was being sarcastic.  According to FOX this was one of his EO's that he stated months before he had a 30 day plan for:
agreed, just expanding on Trumps playbook :
Failed Yemen invasion - Obama planned it
Firing off ineffective MOAB - Obama authorized it.
But he takes credit for things like opening the coal plant in PA that the Obama authorized or job opportunities companies planned years ago.
This is not the time to be working constructively w/ Russia on anything. They meddled in our election & committed cyberwarfare against .
To achieve this aim, you need to fire obstructionist #NikkiHaley, who obviously works for #Graham & #McCain. @TulsiGabbard as a replacement?
This is madness egg. What do we do?!
I wish I knew, if we have to wait too much longer for this investigation idk. We probably don't even realize how badly we're infiltrated now
Wasnt there also a russian red head that was a high end realtor? Wonder if she knew him or associated in any way??
Oh probably, all these shady people know eachother, trump himself admitted on camera he knows pretty much all the scum. Birds of a feather..
I know how to search for this stuff....suoer fucking easy. Will train anyone willing to learn for free!! We all need to be sleuths
I agree! Let me know what you find or if I can help 
If you are serious I will.
So disturbing to see our Pres. Working so hard and not able to get Congress to do their jobs.   Remember this at the polls.
Congress We the people are watching you do the right thing work with our President MAGA 45 !
Because they have worked so well before...
Don't u think there's more to fix with Russia
Jeff is a bot, and no we dont love you, you so called president....

We negotiated a date night, every first Saturday, of each month. Now it is time to move forward with my relationship with Russia & my Putiny
I think Alec Baldwin is a better Trump than Donald Trump #WhatWouldAngelaSay
South Syria: less than 24 hrs after so called ceasefire, government launched large-scale attacks.  That's another failure for Trump. Or lie.
What's blackmail does your Puty Booty have on you PUPPET BOY?
Sounds to me like Putin wants a return on his investment. Or you could quit your new job. I think America would be okay with that.
Great job Mr president
...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives.  Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
Since when does America reward foreign powers who have ATTACKED US!?! There's a good reason everyone is dogging you #TrumpTraitor
You are tied to our election cyber attacks. Where the hell is GOP? Is everyone on drugs In Washington? This is utter bullshit. This is not
Absolutely the right time. 
@POTUS your blocking doesn't work when saying and telling truth buthole! I'm still on. LOL. Go have a heart attack PLEASE!
Ay ahora no puedo parar de leer sus Tweets  je @JuliLafont
Sameee me pasa lo mismo no lo supero y no quiero que se termine
Te juro que yo tampoco, me encariñe con el Donald
Jajajajjaja same, me lavaron el cerebro y ahora me cae bien
That sucking sound you hear is don's permanent Putin pucker. Sad. #trumpito
Out of his mind
What you promised yo me America Great Again. You are playing with an corrupt nation. You might as well be in bed with Isis. You shame the US
Vladi's got you buy the , huh?
Better than being brainwashed by the State Dept that Russia is the evil empire when it's the US that has murdered millions with #falseflags.
Both countries are complicit. Canada doesn't get off being Scot free either.
Canada had zero to do with Gulf of Tonkin, WMD #falseflags etc.
These are purely US, Israeli #fakenews creations to consolidate drums of war
I'm not speaking to specifics, but globally.
You mean more business for your family and your friends ?? We don't need Russia we need a president with enough balls to help Americans
wow buddy he really got you checkmated, eh? #failingdonaldtrump @realDonaldTrump #fakepresident
@chuckatkins311 'Re LOVE our POTUS'!!
YOU are dangerously mentally ill.

Yes good job I totally agree you and Putin can solve all the world's problems without the satanic NWO PU
U r right Mr President the current Bunch so use to fighting that's all they know.  You must show them the way, stand your ground, we got you
You are  already doing a "good" job of "working" with the Russians, you  traitor!!
Why now? Are your Russian bank loans coming due?
We have to get together soon!! 
U may not need this word of caution Mr. President, but all that glitters is not Gold.  Reset= "trust but verify."  Godspeed sir.
Life experiences are valuable lessons.  Wish we could all be so trusting.
You left veterans to pay for meds, you left women to pay for meds, and you let men keep the "my dick don't work no more" pills. FO' FREE.
YOU ALONE are responsible for the death of every single child who was trying to come here as a refugee. It is YOUR FAULT and yours alone.
Just resign. You're bad for the country and colluded with the Russians. Take your kids with you. We don't need them either.
A ceasefire in Syria is magnificent. We need to work with the Russians on Middle East & North Korea.
We need to work with the ppl in the Middle East. Not Russia.
Russia has influence over Syria's Assad, and Iran. We need them to pressure their buddies to stop being so aggressive.
No one gives up hard gained power & influence without a big fight. Pressure from adversaries (as a fact of life) is already priced in.

Guess again, traitor.
lets support our allies first; then you can make YOUR deals with YOUR friends. MTGA???
I believe we should focus more on American, college funding and teacher pay. We have people killing one another every day on the streets.
Good! Thanks President Trump! You are a Historical Great Man!
Is it a ceasefire if US-backed troops in Syria are still taking over towns?
Seriously, After Compromising our Presidential Election. Sir, You're Just a Big Boob ! Got Played By Russia.....
Very scary move.
@realDonaldTrump wish you a very good luck you are doing absolutely great job . Good luck Mr.President
Art of the Deal...Go Big, take what U can get & come back for more later. Take fm Russia what is possible & use leverage to get more. MAGA!
Ceasefire didn't last - much like Carrier jobs you supposedly saved. @realDonaldTrump
To be joined again stronger than ever to our GREAT ALLY MOTHER RUSSIA is the BEST, most TRIUMPHANT solution.
Your bodyguards are your f****** respect do you even know how it is to be normal.
@peter196155 constructive is not in the Russian dictionary,but distraction n destruction is, we all my respect my president

#AmericaFirst all others Second! 
& Iraq has reclaimed #Mosul from #ISIS it’s a good day 
Funny how oh so peaceful liberals want to be at war with Russia so bad. Liberal aristocrats brainwash them for business.
Putin played you like the fool that you are.  And you have NO GUTS to go after him.  You're made for each other

Stay out of the Middle East!! #cdnpoli #uspoli #ukpoli #Iraq #Syria #Israel #SaudiArabia #ISIS #Palestine #Libya #Afghanistan
so when is this ceasefire supposed to begin? I guess Assad didn't get the word.
absolutely!continue working constructively w/our Russian friends&don't listen to neo-con warmongers in both parties!#NoRussophobia #DTS

They are still shooting on the Israeli border
Ceasefire good - expand to all Middle East. Focus green energy not Russian petro. FYI- Fox News is fake, too-just feeds sheep for oligarchs
Move forward, you can't get over November, when Hillary got 3 million more votes than you. #Resign #TrumpRussia
Well, good luck with Syria. That is a civil war that Obama and Clinton helped to start.
Traitor
Mr President, if you use Russian dressing on a salad, vodka in a punch, or potatoes in French fries, the media will accuse you of collusion.
- You're a #liar & the only thing you'll get working with Russia is selling out America and your soul. O, u never had soul.
Like jobs at Carrier, G.M. and Ford you "negotiated to save" ?  layoffs occurred within months of your boasts.  Hope cease-fire lasts longer
So you think chiming in on the Syrian conflict gets results and THAT is supposed to make us forget Russian/Trump collusion?
SW Syria specifically, which happens to be Damascus and Assad's base of power. What a coinky dink.
You know they're not trustworthy, right? You know they're our enemy, right? Stupid.
Can we negotiate a ceasefire in chicago?
Good-bye "Make America Great Again." #Trump's new rallying cry: "Move Forward with Russia!" (#TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia @Russiagate)
Bullshit. #traitor #putin #corruption #notmypresident #tinyhands
Get us out of NATO and UN. It's not working for us. We need to stop removing and replacing dictators. It's creating more problems.
You don't want to start Liberal War 3 with Russia?? Good choice.
Oops! Your ceasefire didn't last. Don Jr. colluded with Russia to get hacked emails. Mueller is on the case. Resign or be impeached.
Russia is the enemy to America and the rest of the free world. They hack elections to ruin our Democracy, what an idiot.
Russia is like a snake with two heads; while to talk to one head, the other is biting you!
Now is the time to throw a traitor out of office.
What the eff are we doing in Syria?!
What, like 2 square feet in the southwest corner?
Keep keeping on Mr President We love  you & support you
It is wondering President Trump to see two real men sit down and talk it over, and act with civility, even war kings of ages ago, could talk
Must stop the war as soon as possible.
we have defeated those who were out to destroy us, we will continue to fight to keep you in. Let's start moving forward.

Isn't that why you are being investigated for treason in the first place? Just because it worked for you, doesn't mean that it will for us.
#try_to_act_like_a_real_president_even_once 

Fuck Russia
Because Mr. Obama inaction, so 
former US ambassador and Otto Warmbier died.
Blessed are the peacemakers , many are praying for you, stay strong #WeGotYourBack
If you let them libs will start a new Cold War just to get their way.
Not so fast, Don. There are a few issues still out there: Russian sabotage, collusion, treason, etc. Oh, & your financial ties. Tax returns?

President's son is openly admitting he met with a Kremlin-tied lawyer looking for damaging info on Hillary Clinton. How will GOP respond? https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/884156412368236545 …
Now that you've killed toddlers
Sure you did you fool!!  You couldn't find ur limousine and u expect us to believe you had something to do with a cease fire. Hahahaha
Nope! Not moving on......
You slimy spineless slithering SNAKE .  Go find a place in Russia. Bc Donnie: you're going to JAIL.  TREASON IS A HIGH CRIME.  #RESIST
We're behind you Mr. President get it done
Work wirh Russia? Insane. You have gone full treasonist. Or insane. Disgusting . #vetsagainsttrump
Thank you @POTUS ! America does love you!
Wow you really do suck at this.
It's what we all want; a peaceful relationship w/Russia since the end of Cold War. The Cons and Left are War money mongers. Tune them out.
Russia hacked America now you want to work with them to do it again.
Why don't you all go to A New Country.
What's he got on you?
You're TREASONOUS FILTH!!
You will go down as the most treasonous and disgraced Presidents in US history #TrumpRussia #25thAmendment #OrangePrisoner
By "working constructively" you mean committing treason right?

@POTUS …except that Congress and a large majority of Americans don't trust Russia as far as they can throw them. #DelusionalDonald
Hell, thats nothing new, you've been working with Russia for years now!!!
No! It is not! Russia made you the fake President but since you work for 'we the people' listen to all not just your base! Liar in chief!
Que bueno.
But Trump hasn't accomplished anything...
No you didn't, you did nothing. #FakeAdministration #FakeNews #Resign
Stop working FOR Russia. Not only are you a tool in the most vulgar sense, you're Putin's tool. Traitor.
Work constructively but verify everything when it comes to Putin. We are out of the cold war  but I think he has an anti- american bent.
Dont get too involved w t elitest. We t people &  God put u there. Please remember most of us r middle class not rich. We r proud of you
This is good news
At less you are #mega at something, #megadisappointing
successful with our own Congress to fix our Healthcare I am dying over here middle-class no insurance thanks to Bama's crap care
They Need to Get #Iran out of #Syria also
Baby Donald fucked it up for you agsin
Dear #Trump ..
2/2 .

.... But you have to know that the survival of #Bashar_al_Assad as head of #Syria means the continuation of bleeding .
Dear #Trump ..
1/2 .

We thank you for your noble efforts to stop the bleeding of #Syrian_blood , ...
عزيزي #ترامب
نشكر لكم مساعيكم النبيلة في وقف نزف الدم السوري ، لكن عليك أن تعلم بأن بقاء #بشار_الأسد رئيساً لـ #سوريا يعني إستمرار نزيف الدم
Is this why we're working with Russia now???
You mean the people who hacked and stole our election to hand it to you? No thanks.
The beginning of the end... #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment
Is that what Junior was doing? #TrumpRussia #Collusion
I don't and many Americans don't want to have a relationship with a back stabbing murderous thug such as Putin u are not president material
HELLL NOOO! A PRESIDENT of America cow-towing to A Murderous  Russian Dictator!! You can go live w/& suck up to Putin when you are impeached
Stop saying RUSSIA you just woke up #CNN and now more fake news!
How about we constructively demonstrate we won't tolerate interference w our elections
Now you see isis, etc are eu gb projects, using 'idiot' America. That's why they're not allowed #popmusic. #JAHisGreatest. #CrazyBengieFB
Why would you even mention that country? Get smart that is below diplomacy. Your making it hard to defend you. Too low rent.
You should be smarter than that type of comment. I thought you had a degree. Am I wrong? Do you have a degree
I'm lucky to be canadian then
Why on earth would you want to work constructively with a kleptocracy that clearly doesn't want anything good for a free and wealthy west?
Because "working constructively" is the price to pay for "collusions" & "meddling" that helped Mr. Trump move to the WH. That's why.
I doubt you negotiated anything, because if you did, it would be bankrupt. Like you, morally bankrupt.#DontheCon .
Thank you for all your hard work!  My family and I are so very proud of you!  We pray for you daily and your family daily!
MR Trump you are a hero, and a great American.
Traitor!
NOT SO!
YOU ARE A TRAITOR UNTO YOURSELF!
Ha Ha Ha
YES Putin s a great ally for USA ....you're brilliant Mr President
Keep on believing that. There's a reason The late Ronald Reagan called them The Evil Empire.
He was a goddamned ACTOR and changed the speed limit to 55 .....worst
WTF?
Yes, Trump is crazy for wanting to work constructively with Russia to end a civil war that has killed many thousands of people and should instead start a war with Russia over some hacked emails and partisan Facebook ads. You guys are are sick. Shame on you.
You negotiated a Syrian cease fire so you sell your country to Russia for secret personal gain for them to continue hacking election in US
Sir ,get real do you believe Putin , seek counseling ,stop the pretense and hypocrisy, you can never work with him around cyber security
...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working construc...

Why don't you quit working with Russia and be a man who is for men and women who serve our country. No matter what sexual preference
You= No one likes
Good morning Mr. President, a cease fire in the Saudi-Yemen conflict seems doable. Or Israelis-Palestine conflict.
You mean like when you became #PutinsBitch
Or just giving in and becoming a communist dictatorship
Why does anyone have a problem with one President talking directly to another President?Isn't that their job to talk to each other?
@VoteTrumpPics
Constructive Russian politics is just like constructive US politics. U have to destruct to construct. If u build it, they will come...back.
I wish you could sign my books you wrote I sent to the White House . I was told I would not get them back by your staff:(
So Russia's an ally?
