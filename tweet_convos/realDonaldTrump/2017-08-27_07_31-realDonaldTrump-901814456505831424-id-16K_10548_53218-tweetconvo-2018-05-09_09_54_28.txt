#ClimateChangeIsReal rookie.
Holly he is not smart enough to know!! I saw the news today about his lies but what bugs me is the ones that don't see it!
I see where last week a volcano in India put out more CO2 than man has since he's been on the planet is that trumps fault too
Oh such a bad bot. Bye.
Huh? What did I say? 
Not you @LewisBarber16
Ok that's after I sent the tweet lol
That's what I thought after I sent the tweet

....and the idiots who elect them....
Trolls should never practice politics
You are right, trump totally needs to get out of politics
Are you sure you can spare the time?
Meeting right before @Morning_Joe ends. A show he definitely does not watch.
Maybe the .... wait for it.... CLIMATE IS CHANGING!!
Warmer ocean temps -> water evaporates more easily -> more moisture in air -> extreme storms more likely. Simple science. Even experts agree
It's almost as if...the climate in which this storm developed is CHANGING somehow. Hard to put my finger on it.
To which experts are you referring?  You fired them all!
Why are you so excited. Why? !!!
The experts are talking about you y’fucknuckle.
Since when do you talk to experts?
I responded with the same question yesterday. Witty minds think alike
I'm surprised he didn't put quotes around "experts"
You may want to temper your excitement and use a proper tone without exclamation points. People are dying.
You fucking plum
You'd think there would be some kind of warning from scientists, meteorologists, EPA or the leaders of nearly every other country. Weird!
It's like the climate somehow........ changed
Maybe you could talk about how bad you screwed up out of hate for Obama
You're the best!
# you need to light up" soft ASS Korea Up,because,he thinks you're soft,blow they our of he country, his big belly ELF
# you need to lightup"

#AddTrumpRuinAnXmasSong @
@realDonaldTrump @Romeo50042505 @
What I don't understand is most of y'all HATE Donald Trump but most of your career start back up BECAUSE OF Donald Trump'& making millions &
so tell how can U hate him
That Dont make no dam"sense'
When u hate some 1"
Since when do you listen to experts about the weather?
#ClimateChangeIsReal @POTUS we need sea walls not a border fence prayers for Southeast Texas #HurricaneHarvey
& by experts, I mean creationist, DeVos, radio host to lead USDA, Clovis, & my replacement for PhD Muniz, Rick Perry of Dancing w/the 's.
Thank God Climate Change is A Chinese Hoax#DUH
By "experts" do you mean scientists? Meteorologists? Climatologists? People that really know stuff? Unlike you, right?
Experts have said they have never seen a worse president! Please resign and #MAGA #biglysadforamerica

It's almost like the climate is changing ..
Experts had warned about the likelihood of a large disastrous storm developing in the gulf and hitting Houston. Politicians ignored science.
What are you going to do Mr.President other than tell us good luck again?
Ya, we've never seen one like you either- another total disaster
Bullseye dear
Remember Katrina? Or didn't that count because mostly black people were affected?
Trump - U kinda sound like you're bragging. It would b nice if u would care abt some1 other than urself for once bc it's not always about u.
Are we believing experts now? I'm confused
Hurricane Harvey Devastates Houston as Scientists Warn of the Perils of Ignoring Climate Change
You expect us to believe they can predict weather a hundred years from now and they couldn't predict this Storm 3 weeks ago what up fool
Wow #DontheCon is going to a for real Cabinet Meeting? With a Tele-Conference and everything? He must be real important!
Hmm sounds like climate.....changed?? 
so you believe those experts, but not the global warming experts. At least the president of Finland commented on melting ice in the arctic
Go, read a book - what the hell, a briefing paper - on #climatechange, warming oceans.
That's the problem, our rank and file citizens won't read a book, forget a briefing paper.
Yes, most experts have never seen a worse president than you.  SAD.
Experts say they've never seen an abonimal failure like you. I love experts!
It's almost as if scientist predicted it. Science!
17-day vacation. Followed by weekend with family at Camp David. Plus the 45 days of golfing you already took.
Katrina.  Seriously, people are struggling down there, stop making this a bench level test for you.
You! Seem! Overly! Excited! This is the least of my worries (failing president!), but you could at least chill with the exclamation points
They same EXPERTS that have been telling you about global warming? Now you believe what they say?!?!
SO EXCITING! But how are the ratings (television)?!?
Don't worry Drumpf, soon all that water will fall off the (flat) earth.
Did someone say *experts*? Those people that know science??!
Why are you so giddy, Mr. Weatherman? #Impeach
Because Trump-brand hurricanes are the bestest.
Nobody could have known the climate would change like this! #yeswedid
It's almost as though #climatechange is real & is happening right now! #ClimateChangeIsReal #ParisAgreement
Could global warming have anything to do with it?
oh so now you listen to experts
The second biggest disaster in recent American history, second only to your presidency.
Igonring science is ignorant... Putting profits before people is evil
Gosh and wowie, Donny! Didn't you ever learn about the correct use of exclamation marks?!!?!!!
And yet you still don't believe in global warming
Perhaps if the experts have never seen anything like this, it means that climate change is real; think about it!
You have the lowest ratings in US history.
Bad idea getting out the paris agreement. This is just the beginning. I just pray you get out of office somehow.
Without wishing to be picky the experts DID say this will happen with global warming. And you've pulled out of the bloody agreement!
You can't even pretend to be competent, can you?
And yet no such thing as climate change!
Could that be because Climate Change is making our storms more intense as scientists say, or because bigger is better? What say you?
Do you have any fkn common sense?
Why? Why is politicizing a natural disaster necessary?People have lost everything and I can guarantee you that Obama is not on their mind.
Please, post more screen shots of his tweets. It's quite obvious you're obsessed with him. Get a life....weirdy.
So sad...@ http://kiliedutravel.com 
Are you sure they weren't talking about you, dumb ass?
Yeah, it's called climate change, you dolt!! Please resign and let someone QUALIFIED take the damn job, would ya? #OuttaYourLeague
Wow a first- you believing the experts
Psychiatric experts have never seen one like you, either.
Do u know about the fires in Montana too? Or can u only handle 1 climate disaster at a time? Perhaps u r 2 busy creating ur own disasters.
When in the hell did you start listening to experts???
please. stop. using. exclamation. points.
@potus Nice going Donny. Congrats on leaving the Paris Climate Accord.  #moron #trump #climatechange
yes because of climate change and global warming
Experts? are these the same experts that determine climate change as being real or not? Lol, #wakeupduffus
Are you like masturbating with excitement over a hurricane? Biggest one ever! Experts say is so big! It's big!
And experts also agree on climate change causing stronger and more devastating hurricanes, but you won't believe them!
It's almost as if there's something changing our climate at a rapid pace, if only we had scientists to investigate and advise...
you use exclamation points to try and convey impact/seriousness but it always just sounds like you're excited
#illegitimatePresident #FRAUD #MentallyUnstable #UnfitTiServe #CROOKED #SexualPredator #PEDOPHILE YOU FOOL NO ONE #TheResistance SEES YOU
Better late than never. No, you only believe in science when you think it can make you look good. This vet wants you gone.#asshataspresident
Don't come to Texas with your self-promoting lines of bullshit.  Texas has endured more than their share.  They don't need your ego.
Of course it has nothing to do with #ClimateChange right Dipshit Donny?
#ResignTrump #25thAmendmentNow #TrumpRussia #FuckTrump #Resistance
Experts also took into account rising seas which you dismissed with a stroke of your bloody pen.
Announce your resignation while you're at it.
It must be a nice change to hear people talking about an epic disaster, and for once not have them be referring to your presidency.
You kill me.
Denial of climate change, reasonable zoning laws & building over wet lands will increase disasters two-fold! WAKEUP-climate change is real!
Difficult to wake from a coma.
Whew! Glad it was a teleconference! I was afraid you had to cut your vacation short for this disaster. *smh* 
The Experts world wide say It is as a result of climate change which you deny on behalf of the fossil fuel lobby. What of a POTUS are you ?
You just hunker down in your big house @realDonaldTrump with its pools and golf course whilst climate change ruins the lives of you poorest!
You were too busy destroying our military and pardoning a criminal... The rest of us knew how bad it was going to be
You mean the #TrumpCrimeFamily colluding with Putin?
It's weird. Too bad we don't have scientists to predict how climate change screws bad with the weather. 
Kinda hard to have scientists around when he is busy firing them because they tell him what he doesn't want to hear i.e., the truth
He is! I wanna see how much of the $ he's screwed people out of he'll donate to help!
He can pull it out of his & his kids pockets since they are all so rich Plz. I bet he won't donate a penny But he will steal and take credit
You know it!
since you've been prez, we've had biggest flood, biggest fires, now biggest hurricane.  I think those are signs about you.
Dont forget the Nazi prick that drove his douchebag muscle car into a crowd of people. He's a symptom of Trump is as well.
Try saying doing something intelligent for once
He hasn't even posted emergency info. Others have, but not him. That's his job and he sucks at it.
Will you be reinstating executive order 13690 establishing a federal flood risk management standard and process?  Asking for Texas.
God Bless and thanks for tweeting to keep the American public updated!!! 
You mean the current situation is  different than the past? Like a change? In the climate?
#climatechange
#duh
#CheckTheDefinitionStupid
Never realized how hard the job was...
Are we great yet #morontrump
You don't believe the climate experts, remember, you pumpkin-spice shitmuffin?
Maybe send some troops over to China, just to make sure it isn't something weird like #ClimateChange or something crazy like that!
The REAL issue is RUSSIA TRUMP! TREASON! RUSSIA! TRUMP! TREASON! RUSSIA! TRUMP! TREASON! RUSSIA! TRUMP! TREASON! RUSSIA! TRUMP! TREASON-JAIL
Pres Trump,  the climate is changing all over this world.  Climate Change is real!
It’s just like the consequences of Global Warming
Crazy!  It's like the climate changed or something.  Better make sure the Chinese aren't behind it.  Get Kushner on this ASAP!
It's called Climate Change
Climate change is REAL. I hope that's enough evidence!
.@realDonaldTrump, It's called #ClimateChange. Also maybe you can ask the #Charlatan .@JoelOsteen what #Noah would do? 300x50x30 cubits.
You're a deadset flog.
Experts? Aka Fox News or real scientist. 
Ur obviously talking to the wrong experts.  Katrina's landfall wsd 2005. Have ur Cabinet read @worldTHumP, u sign it in2 law. Call it a day.
We trust you President Trump.
@realDonaldTrump is climate change real yet?
God Bless Texas and the people of Houston in these trying times. POTUS & America Stands United in its commitment to provide much needed aid.
Why have you continuously been celebrating the severity of #Harvey? What is wrong with you? You're not a child and this isn't a snow day.
It. Is. Not. Your. Hurricane.
Experts were talking about how bad a pres you are!
Gee, really? R U surprised...because climate scientists aren't. They've been telling us this for YEARS! And it's gonna continue...
From Pearland, Tx, thank you mr president for the support, and not getting caught up in the politics. Harvey is very different. #maga.
Every, single American citizen should be distraught & sickened by the thought of a fucking traitor in the WH holding cabinet meetings.
Saw pics of that tele-conference, I'm sorry, unable to spot you in the pic, were you there?
This isn't a race, you don't get a win because this is horrid storm.
What part of your brain doesn't stop you from posting these ridiculous tweets? You make yourself look like an asshat!! It's climate change!
He doesn't need to tweet to make himself look like an asshat. He was, is and always will be an asshat.
Climate change. Expect severity and frequency to increase.
Hurricanes happen about every yr. No reason to politize this 1. Keep in mind, the gov is messing w the armosphere 2. Google "cloud-seeding".
This is hardly about hurricane season. It's about the increased severity and frequency of major storms im many places.
Not disagreeing. I just don't think the gov is being completely honest w us. & the media only reports what they want us to hear.
#climatechange
You keep bragging that this is "the biggest one ever," "never seen one like this before." You do know that you don't make the weather?
No one is really confident you have US best interest @ heart. You're a self-serving man boy & we need you out!! #25thAmendmentNow #Resist
What experts?  You fired all the scientists.
In the end you will have done more damage than #Harvey , #Irma and  #CaliforniaFires . You are a menace to society. #UnfitToServe  #Resign
I think they wanted you to bring the coffee and donuts.
Tele-conference
Psychiatrists say the same thing about you.
#ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChangeIsReal
How many times are you gonna say experts have never seen one like this? We all know you're just setting up your excuse for failing Hstn/LA
Ooo. Goodie for you. God you are an empty vessel. #unpresidented
OMG. Their have been worse hurricanes.  #Climatechangeisfake. And 1 or 2 massive hurricanes in 12yrs. Not bad.
Get ready for Irma.   #CLIMATECHANGE ... heard of it?  Not too late to rethink your irrational position.
Climate change, baby 
Good thing #GlobalWarming  is a #hoax  #FakeNews Maybe you can blame the jelly fish
Yeah, Donald. Those are the same experts that are telling you climate change is real!
#climatechange #ClimateChangeIsReal #GlobalWarming How many different ways do we need to hashtag this before you get it?
What experts? The same experts say they have never seen Global warming like this and you don't believe them...
Damn... Maybe science DOES know something. Which explains why Republicans want to dumb it all down.
@realDonaldTrump Lets Make America Great Again we can come back Twice as Strong I believe We Can! #MAGA #Harvey

Yah for you not really
Using #Harvey disaster to promote & sell your #USAHats to fund your legal costs in #RussiaInvestigation is beyond disgusting.
Yes. The science on Global Climste Change is real.
It's probably fake news from the Climate lobby. Don't buy it.
And why do you think that is? Maybe climate change? Mhm. You should bring that one up at your next “cabinet” / swamp meeting 
Your cabinet meetings are a sham. You stripped protection for equal pay to guard workers from discrimination. You are out of touch.
I hope the experts don't try to tell @realDonaldTrump something crazy, like maybe the climate is changing.
Our moron in chief!   
What on earth do you think could be causing it @realDonaldTrump? Hmmm? #sarcasm #climatechange  #profit
@realDonaldTrump your doing a great job with Harvey keep up the good work.
Weird, as if the climate...is...changing? 
Why don't you just get some popcorn & pull up a seat. Your enthusiasm is just deplorable.
#ClimateChange by humans!
Since when do you listen to climate experts?
If you hadn't removed Climate change science info from the White House Website, maybe you'd have some clue as to why this could be happening

#Texans saving Texans and the federal government under our great @POTUS all battling the biggest natural catastrophe we have ever faced. https://twitter.com/flipitred2020/status/902635614834528256 …
...I can't tell whether or not you're bragging about having "the most tremendous hurricane, way better than Obama's. Everyone says so."


Try to accomplish something right and make sure you eat all up that good food.
I heard you have positions open- I have art degrees, can I be head of national security??? O please say yes #fingerscrossed
Climate Change  ClimateChangeClimateChange ClimateChangeClimateChange ClimateChangeClimateChange ClimateChangeClimateChange ClimateChang
Are you considering this bigliest hurricane one of your "wins"?
Yea!!!...... Says Donnie.."Climate change is a hoax!!!" #RESIGN #IMPEACH
Oh you believe the experts now
You do know this is ALL SCIENCE right 
#TrumpResign
It's God shedding tears because America is lost & a mess
#Harvey has searched for #CorpusChristi. It's a sign!
Of course a tele-conference.  You already should have  visit Houston,  but no time had to play Golf and bankrupt the usa.
This is definitely somehow your fault.
...and the Experts aldo have Said they never see a ass like you before Mr...Donald....
RESINGE DONALD...
AND MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
hi...take care  my  MyanMar. Pls.
Oh. You're still here.  You might wanna do something about that flooding Donald. Stop tweeting shit.
