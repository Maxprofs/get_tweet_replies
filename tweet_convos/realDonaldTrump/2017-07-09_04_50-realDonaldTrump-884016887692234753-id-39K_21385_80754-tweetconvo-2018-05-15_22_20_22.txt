Putin must be rolling on the floor with laughter. Russia orchestrated a massive hacking that impacted the outcome of an election...
...and instead of being punished for it, Russia is being requested to form a cyber security unit?!
It's like fox telling hens that he didn't eat any of them, and that he's going to keep all hens safe if they work together.
PLAIN AND SIMPLE PRESIDENT TRUMP....PUTIN ALREADY HACKED US TO MAKE YOU PRESIDENT SO GO HACK RUSSIA'S COMPUTERS TO THROW PUTIN OUT!  DO US THAT FAVOR ....HEY, I  HEARD PUTIN HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT VISITING ALL MCDONALD'S TO GIVE YOU A POISON BURGER
Yeah sure you are!! He already sold our Country down the river. Just so he can build in RUSSIA!! Make more money off of RUSSIA!!  tRump's the TRAITOR!! 
Also has a CROOKED CRIMINAL FAMILY TOO!! This is how I see him & his family in Future!!!!!
He also sent in his deposit so the Nigerian Prince can send him his winnings

First he says 

Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..

Now he's onto ZTE

& the Steele Dossier says what about China?
One of your best public ass-Kissings so far.
#PaperBallotsNow #PaperBallotsNow #PaperBallotsNow #PaperballetsNow  Do you really think anything you come up with in connection with Russia would be accepted by the American people?  #trumpisdelusional

wow Lulu.. :0)
Any progress? @PressSec  @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
You've done an EXCELLENT job of guarding the "negative things." Now, maybe you could focus on guarding the positive things. Like...election security, for instance.
Henhouse, meet fox.
WTF???
How is this going?
Same question^^
Traitor.
“Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..”

- #Trump (July, 9th 2017)
No Putin or his unit near our infrastructure or voting. No, no, no.
Such a sickening idea.
Can’t anyone hear them screaming for help? Russia IS BLACKMAILING TRUMP & GOP. They are doing all they can to prove it, to show us they need help. They don’t really want to destroy America; @FBI @CIA please send help. They’re obviously scared. Nerve gas in UK was a reminder.
I think that last word is supposed to be guided!

hahahhahahhahahhaahaahaha and lololollolololllllllllllllllllll
AKA "Putin told me how he rigs his elections so he wins bigly, and he's going to set that up for me."
NO MORE CATCH AND RELEASE AND ILLEGALS VOTING WILL BE PROSECUTED AND DEPORTED !   MAGA
No words 
I’m sure he said “don’t worry Mr President, I’ll take care of it” 
Yeah sure you are!! He already sold our Country down the river. Just so he can build in RUSSIA!! Make more money off of RUSSIA!!  tRump's the TRAITOR!! 
Also has a CROOKED CRIMINAL FAMILY TOO!! This is how I see him & his family in Future!!!!!
You are such a dope. Putin is using you like a rented tool. You don't even understand your own words.
Did YOU Say THAT? SERIOUSLY??!!
YOU conspired with #Russians, Invited Them TO INFILTRATE Our Democracy & now Want US to Let YOU Lead The Fight AGAINST Your Own #TrumpRussiaCORRUPTION?
That's Very #RussianOligarch Of YOU. #TraitorsGetOut! Run Donald, RUN!
Lol...and now @DevinNunes trying to spun #TrumpRussia as some Democrat issue. 

This trash is yours, @GOP. He is all yours. You could have done something about him for over a year. He gave you an excuse every day, but you chose to dig in deeper. 

#TrumpColluded #GOPComplicit
If the @GOP are smart, then they probably ignore Twitter except to broadcast propaganda. Twitter is kind of a mess, most of the time.
Did Trump 'really' think that this was going to fly?  He is so completely out of touch with reality he should be incarcerated.  We knew we were in trouble when he suggested this --- at the same time he abolished the National Office on Cyber Security.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaMzmH_0bW0 …  Still no #RussianSanctions, Trump is paying bribes left and right (Stormy Daniels etc). Trump is accepting bribes via Trump Organization, Trump Hotels, Mar A Lago etc., patents from foreign governments... etc. #ResignTrump
Tantamount to purposefully letting the fox into the hen house and locking him in? #RussianMeddling
Really??  What is wrong with you?  RUSSIA ILLEGALLY HACKED OUR ELECTION, 13 Russians have been indicted SO FAR.  And do you know that these tweets could be evidence against you?  Unbelievable...
Seriously: Did Putin play you like a fiddle? Or were you his unwitting puppet? Or were you BOTH in on it? Or was Putin ALSO fooled by string-pullers in his country? -- Try questioning things people tell you, especially online.
Yea, you and Putin. Nope. No. #resign and run to Moscow. Cuz you’re gonna need to leave town. #flimflamman
We don't want you discussing security with #Putin when it has been proven that #russiainterfered in our election. We want to hear you do what you do best - say he is a #badhombre and whine about how #unfair it is that he did what he did. Then pass the #RussianSanctions 
.@realDonaldTrump Frightening that those words would even come from your fingers! You had no clue what was going on when you tweeted this. A partnership with the very man who ordered an attack on our election! No one in public America has been more of an idiot than U! #Resist
#BradParscale   Texas Company + Trump Associate + "Trump Campaign Digital Director" + worked w/Trump since 2012 + #13Indictments statement + #Mueller = #BradParscale Persons known or unknown to Grand Jury. #BradParscale
It's a way for Putin to get all the information he wants about this country and it's people.
Seems he's already got it.
Like your treason.....
Geez US. And you gave him the keys to the vault? #InmatesRunningAsylum
Not US. Trump. Trump did this. #HelpUs
Yeah what about those sanctions now?why haven’t u imposed them? #TreasonousTrump
I guess this is the part where we say "Whoopsie!"
Can you believe this POS?
Whenever trump says "things," it's so obviously a stand-in for "stuff I forgot/didn't understand."
No it’s a stand in for “things I don’t want to say”
You know, reading this again I realize that the way Trump has worded this he is saying he wants hacking and negative things guarded, not guarded against.
EXACTLY!
You should resign already...No place for you and your family in our democracy..
I bet you did discuss it -- more importantly, how to make sure such a unit is never formed.  Resign.  You're a disgrace to the office.
This beauty has aged particularly well.
Trump met with Putin: “Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.”

Do you and your staff even read these replies?  If you did you would see we are not happy.
Hey Dumb Don, ever noticed that your Twitter is tiny in comparison to Obama’s ? #SmallHandsMeansSmallTwitter
How’s this working out?
Gee, looks like you spelled "guided" wrong, you treasonous wretch.
Mr President...Given today’s indictments are you rethinking this now or will you go ahead? Just wondering. 

Hugs & Kisses, 
America
Russia promised u the White House in return  Trump will left the sanctions. Just admit it America might forgive u
Putin threatens the free world with advanced nuclear weapons and it's crickets from #DonTheCon. #Seychelles #RussianHacking #RussiaGate #MuellerInvestigation #NeverTrump
So you will hack
OMG, can't stop laughing.   How stupid do you think people are to believe not one but 2 narcassistic oinkers.
This encapsulates just how compromised Donald Trump is, the "Puppet" of Russian Dictator Vladimir Putin.

#ImpeachTrump #LockTrumpUp 
#Mueller
#POSnotPOTUS
Trump: I discussed with a mobster a plan to jeopardize my Intelligence Community.
The depths of your stupidity are astounding. Go eat another cheeseburger! #RussianCollusion

When do your lies stop?
Holy Christ! Seriously?
Hahahahahahaha
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Who the hell do U think UR kidding? U never have anything but evil plans & U know it! UR naive supporters R 2 deluded 2 see it, but WE do.
Doesnt even know how stupid he is
Robert Mueller charges 13 Russians with election interference. Somehow the person that benefited from this election feel that it's in the Americas best interest to go to bed with Putin .. I smell fear .. first u.s. president to die in prison due to treason.
You proposed providing aid and comfort to our enemies. That is treason. #Muellertime #ComeyGate
You’re an idiot!! Ever heard the term “Fox watching the hen house”? You’re a fool!! Mouth moves before the tiny little boy brain engages...
How is that Trump/Russia cyber unit working out? When will you finally implement the Russian sanctions? That's right, you won't because that was part of the deal. If elected, you would not allow sanctions against Russia.
#ReleasetheDemMemo
?? Smart move??  !!! ???
You have got to be kidding me. #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily #MoneyLaundering #clown
Good. China needs to stop hacking us and Russia all the fucking time.
So let’s have the Fox guard the hen house?
This aged well.
What?
LIAR! 
HOW DOES THAT FEEL???
Oh boy, coming from a man who has no idea concerning technology.  You still think a server is the person who gives you your 2 scoops
Ha ha good one he is happy with his two scoops!
Lol  i'm sure the Russians would be very helpful in that matter
@realDonaldTrump TREASON WEASEL you are goin downhill faster than Chloe Kim 
How many times did you have to backspace to get the spelling right on "impenetrable?" Just a ballpark...
Remember this???  tRump is a fool. Sad.
Bwahahahahaha.
Of course you did. Campaign contribution from Putin for 2020.

You’re literally the worst president ever.
 
Idiot
Then why haven’t you addressed this with Congress? Lies are piling up, walls closing in. I’m rejoicing.
Who's gonna be the Dominant One....lol
Again LMAO!
Collusion
@POTUS Are you kidding?
You will be guarded. We will be screwed. Never. Will. We. The. People. Allow. This. To. Happen. Russia hacked our election and saddled us with you. You will be gone soon. Impeached. Jailed. But a warning to future generations to pay attention.
Yup you are definitely working for Putin. What is he giving you?
This must have been another presidential joke. No?
Thank goodness-finally a solution to election hacking!  So many children have died from this....
I will assume that Russians will be placed on your list of bad hombres to be banned from the US? Of course, right?
We even shared passwords....

I’d talked to cyber security professionals in my own country. Just sayin’.
Either Trump is the biggest Moron of all time in the history of the world  
...or he knew 

...or probably both 

#PutinsPuppet 
#13Russians 
#RussianCyberWarOnUSA
How are those discussions with Putin going, you traitorous fuck?
I just noticed that he tweeted this last July! He should have been nailed then. 
#TheResistance
Looks like you already had a cyber deal going as candidate Trump. T is an embarrassment resign already
This is holding up well.
Don’t remember the Trojan horse, eh?
Brilliant idea.  Brilliant.  Who thought of it first?  Let me guess...
I still can’t believe people actually voted for this traitor for president.
Wait .... remember this ? cc @PhillyD
Great, while you're at it why not share the nuclear codes with him.
This aged well.
With the Enemy? 

#YouAreBrainDead 
#TalkToUSBob
Impenetrable...except by you and Russia, right?
As you won't release your taxes, possibly because you have something to hide, will you show us your prenup with Melania? Wondering why she hasn't roasted you yet. Love always
Remember this one Donnie.  Hah.
And another reason that you are the dimmest bulb in the Presidential fraternity. But clearly you are the only Traitor in that group!
I am sure the unit will be up and running very shortly
That picture would Jesus and the little boy in the red consider that my father my youngest son. But Donald Trump you're also a son.
Can we discuss? #How I AM more than you *Being* a man? Please, sir? You #Will die without acknowledging #People #Worthy.
Stupid children. Why not build forts in Putin's living room and pretend the floor is hot lava?
@RodneyDavis so are you guys going to do anything about this mess?
Unbelievable I F.... heard it all ,you new Russia did this all along and still keeping Putin up to date with all the info you can give him
How much crap will telling Trump what I think of him get me in ????
Guarded by who, Russia?
Neither of you are to be trusted. #ResignNow #TrumpTreason #MuellerIsComingForYou
Guarded closely, to make sure they keep you in power.
I know this is difficult for you. Why not use "you're" next time?
Dude . . . Dude. Come on.
Traitor.
Do we really need Russia watching over our elections? Seems they voted more than their share in 2016. Why would you open the US to more interference from Russia? Please cut the cord now!! I promise it will only hurt for a second.
Many other negative things... Such as?
Wow. Great plan.
Just how stupid are you donnie? #IllegitimatePOTUS
Extremely Stupid! And you can’t cure stupid! He deplores anyone or anything that doesn’t agree with him, like his supporters, thus the true meaning of deplorables
You are a travesty to the United States & the rest of the world Why don't you just hand over the black bag & nuke codes because you have already revealed top secrets information to Russia
Yeah we the people and meuller see how u talked to Putin forming a cyber warfare against the USA.shame on u . meuller is coming for you .
Once KGB, always KGB...either you're so fucking stupid or you're in too deep. My vote is you're both.
Where can we get more coffee mugs
This was such a great idea. LOL!!
Fake news!
You’re Going To Jail
I'm sure Putin did suggest this to you...choke, choke...can you say or spell GULLIBLE???
COLLUSION!!!
Private Health Care Was working, but Crony Capitalized Health Care is Worth Billions ... RIGHT?
Traitor.
Did Trump mean that the goal was to guard the election hacking & "many other negative things" from being revealed to investigators & the public?
Mr. President i heard wisdom from my grandfather said do not trust Cat with your beef you want us to trust Russain with our security funny
Lies!!!
Donaldjtrump is now making Dubya look like a god damn genius! Are we already living our version of Idiocracy?
Not a smart thing to do...work along side your enemies!  The Russians are the United States adversaries!  Get a Grip!
You sincerely need your head examined - thumbs up after a mass shooting? How and in what universe is that appropriate?
It’s over, kid.
Gettin played like a fiddle smh #prezclueless
Wait...You want to guard, as in PROTECT "election hacking & other 'negative things' "? Sure you do!  And you need only ask Putin for his help.  At least here at last you're being honest about your intentions.   <<Wink>> <<Wink>>
Is that like the check is in the mail bull shit or what. You are a not only a traitor but a stupid stupid, dare I say, man.
you’re the puppet

Not a good idea to set up anything cyber security with the country who does all the hacking
Isn't that a little like letting the fox into the henhouse?
Why would you a d Putin do anything togethor regarding the US security ever! Hes the enemy and if you don't know that you need to move you and your family to Russia...TODAY! Ugh...
You treasonous buffoon, we can all see what you're doing.
I thought this had to be a joke...someone hacked your account...but apparently not...
