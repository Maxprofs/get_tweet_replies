RT @FoxNews: U.S. Markets since election. ...
Does anybody else think this has been overly sugarcoated???
Thanks Obama
Thank you President Obama!
Stock market went up 300% under his watch and his soaring trajectory continues.
Thank you President Obama!!!
I d vote again for D J T tomorrow. Beleaguered and scorned by major media the truth is he has done more than Obama in 7 months. Believe It.
Under the Obama administration the Dow increased by 300 % (6500 to 18000). That's after the mortgage crisis he inherited.
Great.  I love it.  Who says the Donald has had anything to do with it?
Crow now because the markets are about to dive
You are right, Amy. I am not happy about it, but I know it will happen.
@POTUS & @GOP preparing to fulfill another of Putin's wishes.
Another Putin wish fulfilled. President Bannon assisting in "dismantling the administrative state" along w/Tillerson

If you think that's bad. Here's pages 1-3 of the affidavit filed on @realDonaldTrump for sex assault on a minor. Pages 4-6 follow. 
Beat this record and then you can brag. Until then "Thanks Obama"!
It was increasing before the election and has been for years. Keep trying Fox (aka Trump's Propaganda Machine)
Thanks Obama!!!
Thanks President Obama
You can thank Obama for that since this president hasn't done anything yet. His tax changes are years away. Fox is fakenews
Dow tripled during Obama.  6,400 to 18,400. Trump inherited strong stock market, you guys pretending he created it.
All I see is a statement to stock changes since he took office. People claimed it would plunge, it has not.
Love it!  Making America Rich Again!

Bush = Obama = globalist = phony boom bust cycle. #MAGA
Great work President Obama for getting us out of the crisis of 2007
FAKE NEWS
sorry commies and @Rosie  but business/jobs dont like communists

What about the last 6 months of Obama's presidency?
The rise before the fall.
Q2 saw intl. stocks outperform U.S. equities as political risk in Europe abated and uncertainty persisted around the Trump admin’s ability
to implement its fiscal policies. Meanwhile, bond markets began adjusting to the idea that President Trump’s pro-growth agenda of lower
taxes and reduced regulation may take much longer and be more modest than originally proposed. In short, your attempt to make this appear as
if you created this growth, is null. You and your admin have been a hindrance.
“Obamacare is a disaster. It will be repealed and replaced as sure as you’re sitting there.” [Tampa, FL, 3/14/16]
You don't even hold a candle to Obama.  Your 10 times if not more, the worst leader America has ever seen
Thanks Obama! Since this is consistent with the rate of growth for several years and @POTUS admin hasn't passed any significant legislation
Yes, it took 8 years for Obama's job killing, over-taxing, over-regulating policies/ex orders to take effect and create jobs.
Yes, it took nearly 8 yrs to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Yes, implanting bank regulations are essential
How do minorities & women start a business if they can't get loans... or u just don't care, as long as HRC & Dems get rich off taxpayers.
That has nothing to do with Obama. Banks have been drawing lines around minority neighborhoods for years. What are you talking about?
Dems bank regulations, after THEIR subprime disaster, were so strict no one cld qualify, including the very ppl libs claim 2 advocate for.
You are looking at one small aspect of a complex issue which is Big Banks and the failure of the Fed to hold them accountable
Over-reaching by Dems destroyed many community banks, thus leaving only big banks for communities 2 seek mortgages/commercial loans.
I believe that should read-- since election of 2008.
I really hope I'm wrong, but I'm sticking with my prediction that the dow will be under 14,000 on Jan. 1, 2020. #IHopeImWrong
You just failed to repeal and replace....again, and your wall is still nowhere to be found
Thanks Obama!
Big Stk Mkt Rise predicated solely on promises-Now we see Republicans have no intentions of keeping promises where do U think this is going?
Thanks Obama!
Thank you President Obama. He led the country from recession and created a juggernaut even you can't derail. He was the greatest. #Impeach45
And are we going to mention we're still under Obama,s plan till October?
Amazing what can happen when a socialist isn't running the country.
Yeah, the markets have factored in that ignorance has taken the wheel.
Thanks to Obama forgiven food stamps! Yeah right...trump give us jobs...
Really? Did he give you one?? Has he given a job to anyone you know???
Just check the numbers do your math...
I didn't make the claim. You did. Not that math is necessary. Find me one person who has gotten a job (outside of the swamp) via trump.
Obama did't do nothing he was just a kiss ass ....
 still riding @BarackObama shirt tails.  Maybe stand up on your own #manbaby
'Nobody knows shirt tail riding like me. It's gonna be yuge, believe me. Ok...we are going to ride those shirt tails until I'm impeached.'
Jobs, jobs, jobs. Going, going, GONE.

#LiarInChief #TrumpLies #layoffs #MAGA @Carrier
Thanks @BarackObama! You really set the nation up in a good place, even with all of the opposition trying to ruin our success.
That's nice but look at this or have someone read it to you.
Fox News is for no one but FOOLS!!!!!
THANKS OBAMA!
Fake partisan news
He almost acheived the same percentage with the #NationalDebt as well...
Yes so? The rich 1% who have lots of stock are winning. The rest of ordinary americansd are losing heathcare, jobs etc
I lost my healthcare under your President. My state is now in a hiring frenzy now,with the nations lowest unemployment.What are you reading?

Don't show the whole picture. Or facts. Or relevant data. Or anything that's not fantasy. All of that is fake news from the liberal media
The growth seen in Obama years still didn't help stagnation of middle class wages. Just put more money in wealthy pockets
Which is why I also disagree with the proposed budget and tax plan. It will serve only to increase income inequality. Ex: the Carrier deal
Admittedly the Carrier deal wasn't specifically part of his budget or tax plan but I believe it's evidence to the wrong way to view matters
Fox  also Really tried to interview an actul family to view post election increase in cash flows, income
They could have called me. Im doing great this year. Months pay for an out of the blue bonus and another raise coming. Whats your excuse?
Consumer and employer confidence alone will drive the market up that high. There was none under Obama
Well, apart from 8 years of solid growth of the economy under Obama.
Twitler inherited Obama's economy and falsely claims credit.
So, using your logic, Bush got Bin Ladin? Growth has flourished because of Trump. We werent growing under Obama. Surviving at best.
Without wanting to imply anything at all, let's just make sure that's put in context and then people can come to their own impressions.

Boring graphs I know, but just take them into account - however you choose to read them - when you look at statements about the economy.
Also worth reading - how much effect does a President have on the economy and how long does it take:
Between Clinton & 0bama ~ America's jobs were destroyed. Tech, textiles, steel, automobiles, you name it. Bush was hit with 9/11 ~ anomaly.
just waiting for that trickle down . . . wait, that's not money!
You're not old enough to know anything about trickle-down

Thank you Obama!!!!!
If you knew anything about the stock market, you'd know none of it has anything to do with what you've thus far done or said. 
#MAGA?! Ha!
#FAKENEWS
It might be an appropriate time to Tweet a Thank You to Obama for riding his great wave LOL! Losers need winners, I guess you're just lucky.
numbers where going up before you got into office so please don't take any credit for this #notsogreat
NO TAX BILL THESE NUMBERS WILL TURN RED QUICK

Then Harley Davidson announces 183 lay offs in WI & KS. 70 in W VA by CSX. Total lay offs since inauguration over 60k+ #TrumpFailingEconomy

They were excited about the tax cuts to big corps! Not so happy this week with your shenanigans!
The stock markets isn't the economy tho...
Your ratings are in the toilet
#FakeNews by #FakePresident
45 seems to focus upon things like the stock market, which benefits his contributors, and not America's world standing, or the taxpayers
@foxnews no. US market was up before election. Get it right fakenews the illegitimate @realDonaldTrump has done nothing.
Please post trend of all markets in 8 years prior to election - Fauxnews douches!

Obama had things on a roll. Too bad he couldn't been in office the 2020. Instead of all the crooks in there now that are going to ruin it
Showing markets from 2008 to present will show they have been steadily going up.Trump tries to take credit for Obama and this is nothing new
You forgot to post the video of Krauthammer blaming your incompetence for the failure of the health care plan
No taxation without representation simple what we fought for
10% tax now at 50% tax min wage workers spent Their SSI give #pension to Liars
Yet the dollar is at it's lowest value since the election
Fake news


Actual economic pic DUMBFOX & foreign owner Murdoch ignore to exploit middle class & obtain wealthy tax entitlement programs at US expense.
@potus A reminder that you took an oath to uphold Constitution & serve the people of the United States. You do NOT serve the stock market.
Fox, even uneducated people like yourselves know that "since election" has nothing to do with Trump
Fake news!
Like the GOP had ANYTHING to do with this. Go back to what you do best, Trump fluff pieces.
Thanks Obama!
Is every Dumbcrap and left blind? Just look at stock market! It's been up since Trump was elected .
It is still betting on trump to fulfill campaign promises. I'm afraid we are headed for adjustment. Most Americans are not affected by this.
Listen up DT.Your riding on the great economic wave of Obama. U done NOTHING! Passed zero legislation!All U did was play golf.LOSER!!
Thanks, OBAMA!!!
Fake news brags on Trump stealing from the people again. too bad only the wealthy enjoy Trumpenomics. The rest of us enjoy Credit Slavery!
the great bull runs in stock market history. With Obama as president, the U.S. stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, returned 235%
In SPITE of you
No one likes u Donald...numbers in the tank...in bed with the Russians and u are a failure!!!
Imagine if Trump was even 1 percent normal how high the market would be.
All predicated on a Tax Rework that has not and who knows if it ever will be done means one problem will burst the balloon hurting milioons
Nothing to do with FAKE 45. FAKE NEWS. FAUX NEWS. You should be ashamed at the amount of ass kissing of FAKE 45 and his cronies you do. Sad!

32 million. That means 1 out of every 10 men, women and children in this country will lose their health care. #TrumpCare https://twitter.com/theplumlinegs/status/887784885934579713 …
Why do you attribe this increase to the election?
@showdavida @GloboNews Importante informação sobre a economia americana.

All thanks to President Obama.....
Thank you for the proof that the RICH ARE GETTING RICHER. Please state what you will be doing to address poverty. We are dying to know.
Must be fake news. Trump tweeted about this so it's fake news.
Thanks, Obama.
Nice fake news
@realDonaldTrump greedy people expecting to profiteer off the hard work of the people harmed by you econ&labor policies. Big woo.
People with money are betting that other people with money are going to make more money. Please stop, you're embarrassing yourself and us.
@realDonaldTrump Riding Obama's coat tails.  Gotta sell quick.  The bubble will burst soon.
Those are based on Obama's economic policies, you complete idiots. Trump hasn't been President for very long.
Thanks @BarackObama
Meanwhile ...
Thanks Obama.
Are all those profiting off of this going to share it with those that CANNOT invest due to the cost of living?
My gut instinct says there are some shakers and movers speculating instead of investing in #Our #Country
