Available on DEMAND now on your Home T.V - "HILLARYS AMERICA", This is no Joke People - TRUMP must WIN !
@KellyannePolls ask that any fbi agent that comes forward be pardoned, let's see if we can get some facts on the corruption
It's us against the world and..............
Isn't that the NYTs business as usual?
we have the same problem on 8chan
LOL! Useless news!!
if that's true, it's b/c your a liar. We're tired of you, fade.
FYI
I agree, whoever heard of the LA Times!!! I'm a bit nervous abt Comey's stupidity.
http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/create_your_own_president_map.html?map=HI_1,AK_5,FL_6,NH_2,MI_2,VT_1,ME_2,ME1_3,ME2_3,RI_2,NY_2,PA_2,NJ_2,DE_2,MD_1,VA_2,WV_5,OH_7,IN_7,IL_2,CT_2,WI_2,NC_6,DC_1,MA_1,TN_5,AR_5,MO_7,GA_7,SC_7,KY_5,AL_5,LA_6,MS_6,IA_7,MN_2,OK_5,TX_7,NM_2,KS_6,NE_5,NE2_7,SD_6,ND_5,WY_5,MT_6,CO_1,ID_5,UT_6,AZ_7,NV_6,OR_2,WA_2,CA_1 … Worst case, she still wins
I'll look @this. I look @ t/polls on this site but never the map. You look at 538 don't you? I also use 270towin pie chts
I look @ everything. At this pt it's about turnout. Ppl may be turned off about bogus Comey even though she did nothing
Comey s/b fired. & you're right it's about turnout.
it's not "making things up" when you and Billy Bush are on a video tape...
If this is true, that no one pays attention to NYT, then why does Trump keep talking about them? @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
you're so childish  smh , obviously a trumpett clown.
ashley the twisted liberal wacko lol
why you so mad, he just doesn't have the electoral votes , The end lmao
I personally feel 4a historical Sex assault allegation to be reported it should have a police report or law suit
This election isn't about the serious affecting America & the world anymore.  Sad.

or grope women in the middle of Fifth Avenue.......my voters are brainwashed.
doesn't give 2 shits about you. It's time fir a change no career owned politicians
@nytime  I agree but Trump is not the answer to anything great formamerica...he's too flawed
politically incorrect but I believe his hearts in the right place & he lovesthis country
hard to back a whining bully
Your already being bullied by the establishment to blind to see it or u like it
He needs to lay out his plan tomorrow...grandiose ideas don't solve problems
just like you make up lies along the way.
every President (or people who serve in high ranking decisions and advise the President) are faced w/ this
no, no they don't.
the story's he talking about have been debunk by witnesses
Did you see the people he paid off to be his witnesses? worse than deplorable
he never paid them off. Hillary on the other hand

maybe if DJT stops lying and attacking those who disagree, POTUS would have more credibility. #justsayin
Failing? Subscriptions are at all time high. You, on the other hand, are being investigated by everyone but Ronald  McDonald.
so what's new
“You know, it doesn’t really matter what [the media] write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.”
Wow, a peck on the cheek.... Trump, all good citizens are behind you! The trash follow corrupt Hillary
look, you will probably come off better if they make stuff up than you actually do when you open your mouth

wait, I should be getting paid?  AGAIN saying Trump is a horrible person doesn't = like Hillary

hmmm, I'm not a democrat. But guessing you lump all together anyone who disagrees with Donnie
You are part of the problem.
nice copy paste!! Anyone who thinks Alec Baldwin isn't great, is the Problem!- Mike 4:17 @OnLikeALight
Trump and Cosby, middle ocean, sinking boat, 1 life jacket... Where do you hide it?
TRUMP: I kiss women without permission all the time.

WOMEN: He kissed me without permission.

TRUMP: Liars. All liars.
When did he say he kissed women without permission all the time?
"I'm automatically attracted to beautiful women—I just start kissing them … I don’t even wait." He doesn't wait for what?
context and full quote.
Welcome to Twitter, it's limited to 140 characters. Not my job to Google for you.
give me the link. you can give links in Twitter. if not, it's fabricated quote. didn't they teach you to cite your sources in college?
Are you joking? It's the damn videotape of him speaking, not a "fabricated quote." Unreal.
full video sounds like the way a high schooler would talk. like you haven't said the same. smh...
cite sources next time.
the women who you touched are the sources, you dolt.
<---Disgrace! #msm #MAGA
distorting the truth, oversampling democrats over  republicans in polls. Ghosting hit pieces on trump
trump has always admitted when he done wrong hillary just wants everyone talking about trump so no one listen to wikileaks
Try  tweeting them back when they contact you.
-forget it. Just pummel your plan for better wages, security and regard for ALL CITIZENS !!
Why talk to you? Everythng out of ur mouth is either a lie or completely paranoid and delusional
can we get something other then trash talk? Give us some policy to understand what your plans are. We need more

the media is pulling out all the stops not to get u elected it makes me sick
stay on topic, your fans love you! We need you! Talk about all the things you're going to do for this country!
So what you're saying is they're acting like you.

HRC wins and does what she claims, not her public face, but private, there will be consequences.1st target of all
I wonder why.
 why bother
waaaa waaaa waaa
play the music!!!
's sexual perversion for preteens and teens plus his mental illness makes him unqualified to be POTUS
Perhaps you have nothing worthwhile to say, Donald.
So ... when they don't call, you say they lie... Did they not lie before that? Because you said they lie then too?
A conscious planned process is in place to defame you & @nytimes @CNN are major players in it. Double your efforts man.
Why would they call somebody who's gonna sue 'em??  So where's the lawsuit, Big Don???
stop talking about the women and get back to the issues
I didn't go to Harvard or any college but I am smart enough to know Donald Trump is our only hope
Trump, all of us good citizens support you! We do not believe in the lies that is spewed from the corrupt...
You need to not answer questions at debate and speak Wikileaks. Thank Chris 4 question but I have to talk wikis
All Supporters including Newt even Huckabee says enough of this focus on woman it might be too late Issues !
did your mother not teach you no one likes a bully...worse yet a sexual predator..please go away
I don't suppose you might have reflected that at some point you might have provoked them? Just saying.
I guess you are no longer "fit to print"
Haha!
Visit Hillary's twitter page. Her tweets are that of a PIG. She is disgusting and deplorable.
Sad our country is on its way to ruin. People will revolt and damn I'm glad I'm not them. They will be 1st target
WHO still uses the NY times..?
Not a shocker. Stay strong, stay steady, stay focused.

and yet @mike_pence just quoted them today on Fox. Might want to talk to your VP and get your stories straight.

is a fascist
@nytimes
Why would they call you?!? You're an idiot with no credibility!  @nytimes @CNN @FoxNews
#TrumpAlibi "I did not do it because I was doing my taxes at that time"
is try to lead Junkmedia, fighting @CNN for top seat as No1 in JunkMEDIA. American's want the truth.
Why should they bother calling you? You have nothing substantial to share. @nytimes
TRUE TRUMPIAN IN PHILA
because you're not a reliable source
81 days since you've done a press conference. Just saying.
, Lock Him Up..!! Put The Sexual Predator on Jail:
#MakeTheSexualAssaultGreatAgain. #GrabbingAmericaByThePussyAgain
why would they call you...they know you are a pathological liar like the rest of us know.
quit worrying about it.  Issues
remind you of anyone?
@Veteran4Trump @nytimes who cares? They are tainted and 94% of Americans do not believe their rubbish. #neverhillary
The NY Times, like @CNN make up fiction. They are "Today's Fiction. I don't watch them. I get my news from #Trump
The Sorry Lazy Bums R Probably using Mike Barnacle as a Source. HA I shouldn't laugh they probably are! WIN THIS!
When @MrsGandhi tries to avoid equating feku @narendramodi with liar @realDonaldTrump by quoting @realDonaldTrump
That's ok, they make shit up the way you make shit up with regards to foreign policy 
keep reminding us what you're going to do to restore our decaying country. Dem are trying to derail you by jarring ur focus
@LdyGuin @nytimes she can not win on the policies u will win she has no policies at all she's like a deer in headlights
If you keep lying and threatening press rights, of course they will start to avoid you. Why do you deserve respect
@Surfingcity @nytimes It is a sad state we're in We MUST stop HRC It appears she's trying 2 get rid of Julian!
Never seen such a colossal LOSER as Donald Trump...and he doesn't even know it! Amazing.
just like you make up your statistics
Awww they don't call any more? Maybe they're just not that into you.
that's because they are jealous of yall kicking ass and have to make up false things along the way!
@wdfx2eu7 leave any stupid reporters to lie any how they want all we is u..(TRUMP) or know America
Buy that rag and then shut them down
well since the Donald throws them out why should they call? You won't answer.
I hope you don't hold back this time... She runs a crime syndicate
I don't like you, but I agree on that, the media is worse than you and Hillary.We are all losers here no more credibility!
yea..reading it now in kl malaysia.
they have no choice...all you talk about is Hillary - the people are sick of hearing about her

You mean that neither YOU or your campaign returns repeated calls & email when told before the stories release.
didn't you say that any media coverage is good, even if negative?  STOP COMPLAINING
The rich foreign, Mexican that owns New York Times orders his yellow journalist hacks to write lies about Trump!
@jpublik @nytimes They've learnt from you then Mr Trump?
@AwwDiddums @nytimes and keeping the lawyers busy with litigation
just like Trump does
Apparently dishonesty is OK with Clinton supporters. If she wins they will learn that her promises mean nothing
Clear indication media is controlled.This makes it one sided to miss lead millions of Americans.
Like DJT with all of his unsubstantiated accusations!!  Ooooooo it's a conspiracy.  #CrazyTrump
...BECAUSE YOU LIE!!!
Yeah, you tell em. Just because you admitted it doesn't mean it's true. SMH! #TrumpTrain
when ur Pres,they will cease2 exist cuz theres no more Trump to kick around.n rags like that always lose n the end
they don't need to when everything you say is recorded and made public #imwithher #unitedwestand #LoveTrumpsHate
You've insulted our Clinton's "brother and sister".
he is going to be the new biggest loser!!
#TrumpAlibi "I could not have done that because I was committing adultery at the time with someone else"
Uh, NY Times does not make up sources. But you do.
"You never call me." Sounds like Donnie's lonely. There's a reason for that, Donnie. Nobody loves you. Go gropping

They probably figured that since you're always full of shit anyway so it would be pointless to ask you anyway
doesn't Brian Williams work with them
doesn't call you anymore because they're more likely to get an honest answer from a magic eight ball
@lenifillekes @nytimes Donald Trump zal de enige echte eerlijke nog nooit gebeurde leider worden van Amerika
I will never trust these people ever again! Sad:(
you are failing. NYT will be here long after you're gone. They'll report on your fall from your golden tower.
you claim that the @nytimes lied about you. It was your own words who got you into this mess
your campaign is over. Your campaign advisers are on CNN saying how you have no chance at this point. You lost to a woman!
you've nearly lost my interest, please do something outrageous. or minimally say something funny.
Have you tried returning their calls?
please stop trying to defend yourself. Just ignore it and talk policy !!
@HillaryClinton Bet you #NYT lasts a lot longer than you. Delusional
why should they call you? All you do is lie!
I think they learned that from you.
where are all the journalists? They should be salivating at the level of corruption Potus,DOJ, FBI,State Dept.,HRC
That's because you're crazy...........
sue them, we double doggie dare ya!
crybaby
Why would they call you Drumf Hitler? You want to sue them! They will meet you at the Fed Court! Prestigious paper
Hodor :-(
Who cares! Stay on topic economy/borders/corrupt government. Stop making it about you! Its about "We the People"
they are MANIPULATING the people!!
Someone who was not so narcissistic would not even be concerned with this
u banned them right?
your the man Ronny
