@realDonaldTrump but he is right the liberals show there ass once again
@realDonaldTrump I agree.
Trump says that he's been wiretapped.. encourages the enemy to lie about everything, then out comes the truth!
....Rope A Dope
@DonaldJTrumpJr It's a simple case of good -vs- evil
Name 1 time
@DonaldJTrumpJr I hate sayin it but just like me I said he would make U.S. The laughingstock of the world and he did!!
oh and obamanation did such a good job at holding up the U. S.? Remember the apology tour?
@realDonaldTrump Good.  Try to get FULL REPEAL right, too.
@realDonaldTrump love my president  MAGA
President Trump has exposed these jack asses for the last 2 years! Democrats and their media lackeys are beyond jokes!
he's been around he's not stupid and he doesn't lie, he has no reason too
http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/22/politics/us-officials-info-suggests-trump-associates-may-have-coordinated-with-russians/ …
@realDonaldTrump hahaha this can't only be right of you're joking. He literally never is.
@DonaldJTrumpJr can't beat good intuition from someone who can't be bought
Yeah, um..he's draining that swamp right into the WH, and he's under FBI investigation 
Clinton isn't the president, genius! Trump is CURRENTLY under investigation by the FBI. And lied about wiretap
always!
Didn't we meet off Grindr?....
@realDonaldTrump by freaky, do you mean suspicious? Also - No. #tumefairchier
@realDonaldTrump right about what?  That he's going to jail?
@realDonaldTrump he's a winner for us
@realDonaldTrump Trump is a freak...
@realDonaldTrump this statement is just as false as most of Trump's.
Except about voter fraud. He was wrong there. That's it. Oh, and crowd sizes, that too. Wiretapping....
Mexico paying for the wall... Obama's birth certificate...
...your criticisms about Presidents playing golf... that time you said buy American, hire American...
when you said Keystone would be made with US steel... okay, this is actually a really long list.
name one of great achievement your ex president did besides put us $22 in debt
Not collude w/ foreign powers to get elected, not screw over kids & women’s medical care, not support a pedophile. Not have u as assk*sser
@realDonaldTrump yea, his definition of right is alternative right. Which is in fact freaky. Our president is a nazi lover 
the left are the nazis
Leftists are fascists
yes they are
Hey there @pooterrr  it's been a while
 yes it has
@realDonaldTrump Mike Williams is a terrorist sympathizer and a traitor.
Trump has an amazing way of sizing situations up instantly. He also has amazing common sense. Obama had zero
@trumplican2016 Right about what exactly ?
@realDonaldTrump 
The farthest thing from the truth. Inaug. crowds, Obama birth cert, popular vote, Mexico paying for wall...
@DonaldJTrumpJr No Trump is a fraud
 Cry more 
no crying needed. Thanks though
I didn't say you needed to cry, but never the less you leftists are always doing it. Proceeded.
he was pretty wrong about that Obama born in Kenya thing. #JustSayin
@DonaldJTrumpJr Vote count, Sweden attack, Mexico paying for wall, inauguration crowd size, travel ban. Should I keep going?
That's a hell of a list of thing Trump got rig...wrong. The snake oil salesman has a lot of people fooled
[You are here]
no, I am at the part where Trump will never collude with Putin/Russia. Oh wait
Do you get paid to be this stupid or is it a hobby?
classic Trump supporter taking personal shots.  stick to his collusion with Russia
Noted. This has been great. Deleting my account now
@realDonaldTrump You know this not going to work out well for Trump. It's all the denial that is most bothersome. Time to go!
provide one example
Who believes you?
I wish I could re-retweet this
..it's God's hand on him;)

Ut Oh. This may include you #Propaganda man @mitchellvii @KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump #russiagate #TrumpRussia
He usually does not make statements that he is not convinced of, does not  mind criticism - when it is proven false Trump Wins
@realDonaldTrump  Trump would never have gotten where he was in the Real Estate Business if he were not credible and dependable
Or born into $.Or daddy keeps bailing out multiple failing businesses.Or filing bankruptcy over&over.
6 or 7 out of hundreds,  oh you would do so much better.
But it’s awesome !!!!!!
God working overtime.
You bet your ass!!
I think it's called Military Intelligence. Brought to you by the same people who created the internet.
This tweet...aged well.
?????
RT @mitchellvii: Trump always ends up being right.  It's almost a little freaky....
@MichalDouglas9 true...he's prescient
Because he thinks logically
@realDonaldTrump he loves the smell of dt  and all the free golf
Freeky or Godly I dont know but considering alternative i will take either ! Go DJT
You will be blessed when you come in & when you go out. The Lord will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven. 2/2 #Trump2020
Thank you are so right
Deut 28: All these blessings will come on you & accompany you if you obey the Lord your God: God will set you high above all nations on earth You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. 1/2
@mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump your right sir love it. It really upsets the liberals
@CindyDay1 
I guess when you create your own reality out of thin air then you're always right in trump la la land
I love Trump La La Land, so happy here,I want this to last ForEver!!!
Trump is literally the antithesis of Christian values& behavior. He espouses hatred,bigotry,anti poor
Jesus not approve!
Jesus put him in, Dems are full of hate. We had to put up with Obama for 8 years, did nothing, name something??
It's almost as if he has access to intel only the President of the United States has… how could he know this stuff???
Trump was SO right about Obama not being born in the US—even the nurse who wrote his "so called" birth certificate didn't know!
…and look, just flip his approval rating chart upside down & what happens? Winning again—he just can't lose, it's unbelievable!
he even found out how to differentiate between the real and FAKE NEWS polls… All news that's "not nice" is fake. Brilliant!
your vision is Left vision, they don't report real truth,do they report the rapist in school?Do they report any?
Actually, they do...google...it's not just for doodles.
Ah, but you do need to read and write. Perhaps that's where Google fails Trump followers?
oh yeah, trump followers are stupid. Seems that the thugs are all dems.
He must be a time traveler, lol.
It’s VERY freaky
Time Traveler

or not
That´s the biggest joke since his inauguration.
No, the freaky part is you buy into the lies. I have a bridge to sell you, and mineral rights on Mars.
It is a bit freaky how Trump ends up being right!  I never question, just wait for it to unravel! MAGA
U r delusional, like DT.
Got it wrong on biggest electoral margin, Obama wiretap, largest crowd ever, no contacts with Russia. #Freaky
Like my dad always said two wrongs don't make a right-and I'll add it does represent it however. #integrity
Your  trump is not American, he is from  Germany.
@realDonaldTrump trump=liar
@realDonaldTrump he is always WRONG
I'm still betting that he reads Nostradamus' Quatrains, a lot of them do match up to what has happened so far.
@realDonaldTrump Of course he is. He speaks out of both sides of his ass.
@realDonaldTrump this tweet is more freaky.  The liar is always right???
@realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump When he questioned the validity of the Electoral College?
He is smart and insightful.
I wonder how much this guy got paid to tweet this....
@realDonaldTrump WHAT?  He hasn't been right once. Except when he asked Russia to release more emails.
great intuition!
Trump always ends up being right-wing.  It's a little freaky.
@realDonaldTrump epic fail buddy.
If stupidity was painful, you'd be in agony
No he does not.  Trump is the most "wrong" person ever to hold this office
@realDonaldTrump UR delusional! He's never right! He's a pathological liar! He's mentally ill! He lies, then lies about lying!
Freaky, yes . . . but where's your evidence he's right. More really fake news.
lying to cover a lie is lying.   #liar
UR right. Hey looks like that guy William is on the troll again. Silly boy that he is.
yeah, right! Just ask him?
He completely dropped the ball on the healthcare,  then blamed it on the Democrats; 
What a moron!
pretty sure DOJ, FBI and NSA all confirmed Donald Trump lied about wiretapping 
who is this asshole, and are you paying him for this joke?
I think the other side under estimates just how smart he is, but I love his never ending surprises. 
@realDonaldTrump , I know God helped Mr. trump won election, but I don't know that God is making him right on everything !
@realDonaldTrump the only place Trump is always right is in his own mind
@realDonaldTrump HA HA HA HA!!!!! Weak!!!
Obamacare tax voted on late last night how did this happen? This tax is unfair!! Ryan should go#inept
what's freaky is how you didn't even have to take trump's cock out of your mouth to say that!
So nice of you to retweet the mentally challenged.
@realDonaldTrump ew no
@realDonaldTrump bcuz he sets it up he tells on him self. My kids did that too lol
Congrats on the retweet, but it's not like this is Obama. This is a retweet from the #FakePresident
@realDonaldTrump That's right;he's right of Stalin and Hitler and Satan.
@realDonaldTrump what has he ever been right about? are you living in an alternate universe #TrumpLiesMatter #alternativefacts
Only an old, white man would think that 
@realDonaldTrump ok then give me one instance Trump has been even remotely right since he's been placed in office
Obama &a Hillary were mythical characters lost in their liberals fantasies
@realDonaldTrump 
I kept telling people God was going to put him there. Our Lord is with our President!!! 🕆
@realDonaldTrump about what?
That's a lie.
@realDonaldTrump that's right, stroke that teeny, tiny ego.
Its because he knows what's he's talking about before he speaks. Nothing freaky about it..
@realDonaldTrump What's freaky is you don't think facts matter. They matter to the FBI! Too many lies. ZERO CREDIBILITY LEFT!
NO HE DOESN'T
Alt right:  synonym for "wrong"  Trump: synonym for lying con.  "Dont pull a Trump.  Your facts are alt right."
@realDonaldTrump omg yeah he so right 
: No one is always right. At least not for long.
lmao! How hard did you have to look for a good tweet about you? Lmao!
It's a refreshing change since 8 years of this ass clown 
@realDonaldTrump Comey lied, needs to resign, he's all in for Obams.
I just stepped in something that was smarter than you… and smelled better too.
Name one time.@mitchellvii @realdonaldtrump
@realDonaldTrump  Are you fucking kidding?
@realDonaldTrump or when he created a fake university to scam people out of money. Or when he said he had biggest vote margin
It is almost freaky how wrong you always are. Your tweet saying Nunes was right was wrong as Nunes now admits.
Yes it is.  So he thinks so anyways.  This guy is never right in any way but his own mind
@randycaputo President Trump would have never said it if He didn't have proof
@realDonaldTrump you are both clueless
@realDonaldTrump I can agree with some of that.
About what?
@realDonaldTrump So sad that you believe that. So sad!
Well this tweet sure sounds extra dumb after today.
@realDonaldTrump 
Are you related to the great Billy Mitchell? Don't like forgetting our American heroes of WW II.
Right???? You must be kidding.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh wait you were being serious?
@realDonaldTrump  He's a legend in his own mind and to those who kiss butt to his power and money.
@realDonaldTrump in what universe?
@realDonaldTrump talks in circles says nothing .
@realDonaldTrump Do you actually believe the loads of shit coming out of your mouth or are you just suckling at the power teet?
Right about what?He is a clueless , silver spoon ,privileged rich guy that had it handed to him
@realdonaldtrump wow donald, you managed to find one person dumber than yourself. Impressive!
@realDonaldTrump yeah...just like nowwith Obamacare repeal. #Loser
@EntheosShines Bill I agree and have said the same thing
@realDonaldTrump  actually Trump was wrong even  his labdog fox news come out and said so. Trump wasn't wiretapped it was the
except when he's not.  Freaky!
Trump and Wikileaks have something a little freaky in common.  Being right
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs No Bill it is good vs evil!!! Liberalism  is very evil!
@realDonaldTrump hahahaha
@realDonaldTrump so anything above 10% is almost always. Not where I went to school.
@realDonaldTrump right about WHAT exactly? Pls articulate exactly. Voter fraud in the 3M+? Birth certificate? Wiretap? #loser
