What about the deficit? Ask Kansas how cutting taxes helps the deficit. Sheesh.
If you can't pay your bills do you ask the boss for a pay cut? Do you go find a job that pays less? Fix the damn deficit first!
Is Congress some kind of new NFL-team?
Ha. So tax cuts will stop next storm? I'm a little doubtful as pardoning Arpaio (your big action during Harvey) didn't stop Hurricane Irma.
Not much of a leader, are you puppet? So transparent. Always out for the grift.
Puppet  oh you must mean obama george soros's puppet
Obama

Whatever tax cuts you make will save me, a middle class American, no more than a couple hundred a year. Millions will go to the rich.
Will those rich contribute to anything that help the majority of Americans?No. Corporate tax reduction?TRICKLE DOWN DOES NOT WORK. It hurts.
The people are tired of being taxed in to the poor house. We pay income tax, we pay sales tax. Why are we taxed on both?
Whim of the day in congress when they voted!
RT @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @tedcruz Cohn, Mnuchin & Brady are heading down the wrong path on #TaxReform. This will lead to failure also
Wouldn't healthcare for all better serve those devastated right now? #HealthCareForAll cc @SenSanders
Tax Cuts and Tax Reform ARE needed. ARE needed. Oh forget it.
Thank you. He hurts my head with this. (While poor grammar and spelling may be the least of the problems, they are symptomatic, I think...)
They demonstrate a continuing mental deterioration. But, the mind that started wasn't the best before.
This makes no fucking sense
Go Mueller Go!
Uh.. taxes help people who are needing help in crises like this. What is wrong with you
these issues have nothing to do with each other.
Wow. Cutting taxes during a period of disaster. Makes perfect sense.
What exactly is YOUR plan ?  No one has seen it and the logic here seems illogical.  Cutting taxes on top 1% =Gov has less $ to send for aid
Food and water would be nice. These people can't read your tweets cause they don't have cell phones. 
With Irma and Harvey, Impeachment and indictments are needed more than ever before.
You really are an insatiably pointless twat.
It's just so pathetic, i can't even be bothered to get upset any more.
I don't get upset either, and there's no point trying to reason with a man who's as much use as a dildo make of brambles.
Hey you make it, someone will buy it
How in the real world are these related?
No. Just no. Makes no sense and you know it.
Call me crazy but after all the devastation I'd say the people affected by Irma & Harvey want a roof over their heads, food and safety.
How does lowering taxes on the rich benefit those that are now potentially homeless???
But the idea of tax cuts for rich folk is to give them more money to invest into business's
Lowering taxes on the rich almost never works. Top-down reaganomics just isn't the way to go
RT @realDonaldTrump The new Tax Plan from the @GOP, Brady, & Cohn is a sell out to the big Corporations at #WeThePeople & #Americans expense
If there's one thing that the victims of hurricane devastation need, it's tax cuts for millionaires! #itmfa
Congress works for the people, not for you. This is not a football game and you are not a cheerleader. Pull yourself together man!

Congress don't listen!  He's off his meds.  Again.
.Sad. Using our misery to get tax cuts for the rich.
Would love to hear you try to explain what one of these has to do with the other!
Stay on topic, Don! You haven't even finished your work in #Houston yet, let alone #Florida. Tax cuts for the rich can wait
Trump doesn't understand that more money needs to come in than go out. Thats why he BK'd multiple companies
Tax cuts that will put millions in Orange45's pocket! Mmmmm do you like it like that?
*are needed
#math
Don't trade #Amnesty or the #Wall for it our you're done. #WeThePeople giveth and we will fire you.
Impeachment is needed more than ever before.
how come I feel you're lying. Oh yeah because all you do is lie!
Oh it is going to be so good and we will be very happy and we will love it, believe me.
First of all, it's "Tax Cuts and Tax Reform ARE needed." Second of all, they aren't. And third of all, you are an asshat.
Haha that make absolutely no sense.. how does the govt getting less $$ ( tax cuts) improve response to Irma and Harvey?
You're the worst cheerleader ever. #resign
He's more of a mascot...
Screw the tax cuts for the wealthy.  We Irma victims want electricity, clean water and respite from political photo opps.
Clearly your priorities are messed up.
Cleo 4 presidente
Hurricane Jose could be worse than Irma  because it has more time to pick  up  in cloud size it has been over 400 -600 miles across
JOSE means MAY GOD GIVE INCREASE so  in need guys
Anyone who doesn't believe in #climatechange should not be tweeting about hurricanes #Irma #HurricaneMaria #HurricaneJose
No wonder you went bankrupt 5 times
Millions affected by #Irma and #Harvey and your first concern is still the 1%....
Do you know how incredibly ignorant this sounds? Let's cut taxes (for rich) so there is LESS $$ to rebuild after Irma & Harvey. Really?

Isn't two disasters within a couple of weeks enough??!
Go Congress Go? Are you back in high school?
Oh Donald, you just open that teeny anal looking mouth of yours & let words drop out. You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?
The biggest problem is the GOP doesn't actually have a tax plan.  The same thing happened with healthcare.  GOP is failing to lead & govern.
People in Florida and Texas need help rebuilding their homes and infrastructure, not tax cuts. #FakePresident

How in the hell does you small mind make a correlation between a hurricane and tax cuts?
Translation: Quick! While everyone is distracted, give all the money to the rich people!
You are correct Mr. Pres! Let' s hope the Congress decides to do the right thing by the American PP rather than political games as usual!
Sure, because giving corporations tax cuts is going to help the REAL people rebuild!
That might just be the most stupid, most contradictory thing I've ever tweeted.
Good motivation. Congress always responds to Dr. Seuss.
How will tax reform help other than keep more money away from FEMA?
I think you mean, infrastructure, medication and clean water, no?
Is that even in English?
Tax cuts n tax reform for the rich #MAGA
Go Congress Go!
Would u like to explain why you denied Western states @fema for fires? I'll explain...because OUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER!
So yer rich pals can save money rebuilding there mansions?  Tax cuts for rich fuck all for the http://J.A.Ms  (just about managing)
You've got as much chance of getting any legislation passed as riding a camel backwards blindfolded through the eye of a needle

"Go Congress, go!" Maybe setting up a cheerleading squad and a marching band would be helpful here.
All I smell is #KochBrothers radical policies at work. Regressive taxes on middle class & poor 2 subsidize the rich. #DarkMoney
Can you please be mature? You tweet like a 9 year old.
Yeah but will it really help the middle class & poor people? Y'all want the economy to do good but yet only the rich get to spend $$.
Hey dummy.  Remember when you ripped on Hillary for using a private email server?  http://fortune.com/2017/09/24/jared-kushner-white-house-personal-email/?utm_campaign=fortunemagazine&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE …

#FireKushner
So true, however you're giving tax cuts to yourself and your friends instead of the American people. #DumpTrump
Congress has no clue what hard work is. If everyone worked the hours a week and the amount a year they do -feel like were always on vacation
Did you see what Arnold Schwarzenegger said about you?
You Go Donald. Agreed
If you really think you can come up with almost a trillion bicks in disasrter relief while lowering taxes, you're even dumber than you sound
Leave the gasoline stock pile for the northeast alone!!
Because the government doesn't need money to rebuild?  That makes no sense whatsoever
Without tax breaks, how will those beachfront homes be replaced?
Those private piers don't build themselves, you know!
Good        morning       行ってらっしゃいませ、have     a   nice      day
no tax cut for wall street no wall and healthcare 4all and please do not touch our social security .is it legal to touch our social security
How about tax cuts for the people on the LOWER end of the income spectrum? That would immensely help those hit by hurricanes and disasters!
how far off base can a person be?? how are u qualified to talk tax cuts with American people when u wont disclose your tax returns
As morn for my devastated state, opening my home to those still w/o power or water. I think who's dumber, Trump or those who believe is BS?
No one has ever made a more illogical statement than this one.
I'd rather have food and power. Been in the dark since Sunday
Pls explain how Tax Cuts will help rebuild our states/Federal $ comes from the taxpayer/Federal $ is used to rebuild infrastructure 
If you REALLY wanna be helpful then tell duke energy to turn the power back on! Thousands of floridians with no power for 5+ days now.
Your tax cuts and refirm only apply to the top 1% of income they do nothing for the middle it lieer classes in american
Investing in #solar #wind and smart #urbanplanning would be more useful than tax reform. 

#GlobalWarming
Apple kangaroo march leprechaun.  My tweet makes as much sense as yours now.
This makes no sense.  Also, I'd gladly keep paying the same amt of taxes if it helps families recover from the hurricanes.
*ARE
Great.... Let's give more to the people who need it least. #theelite #therich #cronies #merica The only thing that needs to "Go" is you Sir.
We don't trust Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to touch the tax code that's all lies. Just cut the corporate tax rate to 15% and walk away.
You are delusional
The maturity level of the President. Go congress, go!
How in the hell can you even say such a thing?  Is it senility or plain old bullshit?
Yes, that lady working a minimum wage job & lost EVERYTHING...if only she had that extra $5 in tax cuts...
You know what would have totally stopped the rising tides, flooding and deaths? Tax cuts for the wealthy!
Taxes pay for hurricane relief.
With more hurricanes, won't we need MORE taxes?
#NoTaxCutsForTrumpsFriends
Tax cuts for the rich will not get those affected by the storms what they need. They need electricity, food, water and homes. SMDH!
Go Donnie GO! GFY!!!
#FuckYouClownPOTUS
Your Assholiness, you have no idea what you are talking about. Remember this campaign promise? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3tg3hsMyWA … #25thAmendmentNow
Explain how giving your racist friends tax write-offs will help us? How about trickle up? Give us the money & we'll buy your friend's crap.
So how does that help?  Reducing the tax base reduces the $ the govt can spend helping these folks. But you only want to help yourself.
Where then do you propose that the federal money earmarked to help these areas will come from? #MoneyDoesntGrowOnTrees #IdiotInChief #Resign
No one who fled FL because of Irma, who lost their home, or had substantial damage, is asking for a tax cut. STOP BEING GREEDY.
I don't think that's how it works...
With Irma & Harvey devastation, I'd say staying in the Paris Climate Agreement was pretty needed, or at least a belief that science is real.
Only a crazy like you would try to associate tax cuts for your rich friends with the need for relief to flood victims.
After #Irma and #Harvey the people need support and shelter, go away @realDonaldTrump, GO AWAY!
Suppressive. 2 yr old. Now YOU GO YOU GO!
Says the guy who doesn't pay his taxes...
What on Earth are you talking about??? How will tax cuts help??

Oh, Jesus F. Christ. Please take an ECON 101 course. When you have to spend more money, you need to bring in more money. Pretty simple, huh?
And what about climate change mitigation to avoid even stronger hurricanes in future? #preventionbetter
Watch on Amazon Prime*The Enemy Within*change your opinion of all Democrats !
What does one thing have to do with the other? You are nuts.
No Tax Reform until we see your tax returns. The American People must be told how YOU will benefit
RT @realDonaldTrump #American People (your voters) reject the GOP/Mnuchin/Cohn/Brady Tax Plan. It's a sell out to big Corps. at our expense.
Do you understand how stupid that sounds?  You are saying we need to cut revenue because we have extra costs?  No wonder you are BK KING.
.@GOP Remember when you promised your rich buddies you'd get their taxes down? It's on video.
Go Congress go the billionaires need more tax breaks and loopholes!! @DRUDGE_REPORT @maddow @billmaher @POTUS @nytimes @FoxNews @MSNBC @CNN
No tax cuts and loopholes for billionaires. What is your effective tax rate? Release taxes as promised. @DRUDGE_REPORT @SenateGOP @maddow
I guess you out don't understand business!  You don't cut revenues when expenses go up. In government you have to pay your bills
What an astonishing non sequitur.
How are we paying for all this?
Can't get the image out of my head of our inept president using pom poms.
Is there no end to this man's idiocy?  Act congress act!  Cut to the chase and impeach your Führer for firing Comey already!     #DumpTrump
But what is the tax reform & who are the tax cut for? I do think that the wealthy should pay higher taxes. Sadly, they will find loop holes.
How about the 1% paying their fare share of taxes???
You have zero logic. We need to raise taxes to fund spending, like emergency funding.

With Irma and Harvey devastation, tax cuts for the rich are needed more than ever before.
Wow! How classless can one be? How about reallocation of existing funds? Maybe from defense spending?
how does that make sense?
I agree.  We need MORE tax revenue to protect and care for the less fortunate!!!!!


Taxes help funds relief yet @realDonaldTrump proposes corporate tax cuts. Corporate rate and effective taxes are "biggly" different.
Those who are against tax cuts, are those who don't pay taxes to begin with.
What does one have to do with the other?
Yes! Raise the taxes on the wealthy and corporations and reduce the burden on the middle class and poor. Those that can pay, should pay.
Actually, I need power in my house.
How does that make any sense? Your house needs major repairs but you take a part time job
RESIGN
Nobody has issues with that, what people have beef with is when billionaires are the biggest beneficiaries of ur tax cuts
When you DESTROY HUD,&other recovery/ support institutions. 
The citizens suffer. 
The True test of UR Admin is coming. 
Remember Katrina?
How does that help hurricane victims?
I think you meant power and running water.
Disaster Relief + Ridiculous Border Wall  <> Tax Cuts
Tax Cuts after two devastating hurricanes?! How does that make sense?!
PLEASE don't forget the Humane Society during our help to these Harvey, Irma regions of devastation
Using natural disasters to further your agenda is a very weak move. Your base got hit. I can't wait for you to disappear so we can #MAGA!

That sounds like something from a Dr. Seuss book.
It's the only way to grow the economy... take off the shackles.
Absolutely correct
You should try to work with both parties, but as Republicans we still will continue to support The "Republican Party".
Also remember it's  the Democrats who tried to elect Hillary into Oval Office, stab Americans in back, & destroy America.
Trump try seating both house leaders Rep./Dem. to solve tax cuts, repeal&replace ObamaCare. Never really trust the Democrats.
@TheNamibian your eReader is sharp. You did a great job.
Sir, you have no idea what you're doing. Resign now. #25amendmentnow #25amendmentnow #traitor #TrumpRussia #trump #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist
As the planet's climate grows increasingly hostile we'll need to increase corporate tax, Don, not decrease it. Figure it out.
How illogical Don...losses may call for raising money to help in Tex and Flor...two states dominated by climate change deniers
#ConDon uses #climatehange as an excuse for corporate tax cuts. Bulls**t.
This is an out of touch prick that needs a good kneeing
STILL Standing with Trump 100% to make the best decisions.
