Why were similar numbers for Obama considered pathetic?
RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: GREAT AGAIN:  +235,000 http://bloom.bg/2mqYtUJ ...
... Biff did however create jobs for the Trump family !!!
since they engage in yellow drive by journalism at http://Pollitco.com , I will call them lying hypocrites here on jobs.
Sorry to burst your lying bubble, still coasting on Obama policies, Drumpf having made NO policies that would affect jobs at this point.
What policies has 45 put in place that help create these jobs?
Those were on Obama's watch not Trumps, Trump did nothing but lie about jobs.

And those since then? Why didn't the businesses come back with Obama?
Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP

@realDonaldTrump #ThanksObama
@realDonaldTrump @business this time next year when the economy is tanking due to @GOP policies, it will be RUMP's handiwork
@realDonaldTrump @business u clearly don't understand how the economy works. This is Obama administration results. 1/
@realDonaldTrump @business It's not because of your doing, orange man. It's because of what Obama did!
You have such a "great" vocabulary.  Did your Daddy buy your degree from Wharton.
@realDonaldTrump Face it-u suck as a Pres!!! No knowledge of politics, can't work WITH others, policies suck!!
yes, a continuation of the great job Obama was doing - nothing to do with you
fake media will not cover this factual info! CA sad!
@realDonaldTrump @business Awesome news
not your work
@realDonaldTrump Yes Obama was!
It's a beautiful thing when potus is retweeting Drudge!!! love it lol
Donnie had nothing to do with this either! Only losers are so desperate as  to take credit for others' work
Pathetic that you use the Drudge, Breitbart, and at best Fox for your "real" news
Nice job @POTUS44 @BarackObama
Morons - this is pace per previous administration.

The only way I'd lay naked with you would be in a mass grave
Why is it acceptable for you to be an idiot but not for me to point it out?
As an outsider, what do you think of the human race?
Your mom sent you back to the hospital for a refund.
@Veteran4Trump @business WHY is a story on jobs considered "sensitive content" to Twitter?
Yah but, February 2016 under Obama got 237,000 jobs. In Feb 2015 it was 238,000 jobs. Obama beats Trump!
@realDonaldTrump Next thing you know you'll be retweeting Breitbart another source of the "truth".
@realDonaldTrump @business I'm confused 45 now the numbers are not fake?
Out of 100,000 sperm, you were the fastest?
Yo momma's so fat the escape velocity at her surface exceeds 3.0x108 m/s
If you really want to know about mistakes, you should ask your parents.
You're the reason women beat their husbands
Of all the mistakes your parents made, you take the cake!
What's the difference between you and a brick? The brick gets laid.
Yep I am adopted, my parents chose me, your parents are stuck with you.
I’d give you a nasty look but you’ve already got one.
I’d slap you but I don’t want to make your face look any better.
So are we going to give Trump credit for Feb 2016 and 2015, because increase in jobs were almost same? Lets look at whole pic
With a face like yours, I wish I was blind.
 Look, you aint funny. Your life is just a joke.
With a face like yours, I wish I was blind.
If stupidity was painful, you'd be in agony
Did you know they used to be called “Jumpolines” until your mum jumped on one?
If brains were made of gold, you and your family would be beggars.
You're trying to take credit for something that you have had no input in achieving you utter muppet.
Completely irrelevant! After all it was you who said such numbers were "fake", "phony" and a "joke".
If you were half as funny as you think you are, you would be twice as funny as you are.
Just because you have one doesn’t mean you need to act like one.
I know how you got so rich. Yo momma's so fat,when she wore high heels,she struck oil
Your lips keep moving but all I hear is “Blah, blah, blah.”
Someday you'll find yourself, and will you be disappointed.
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? Like a coma.
You are the reason people are blind
Your teeth are so yellow traffic slows down when you smile
Your mom must have a really loud bark!
Your mother's teeth are so yellow, I cant believe it's not butter
The only way I'd lay naked with you would be in a mass grave
(Phone ringing)... Excuse me Russia called, they want their idiot back
With a face like yours, I wish I was blind.
Out of 100,000 sperm, you were the fastest?
Why don't you check up on eBay and see if they have a life for sale.
Which sexual position produces the ugliest children? Ask your mother.
You realize that's the same number as last year, don't you?
If you were half as funny as you think you are, you would be twice as funny as you are.
Thank you for restoring our faith in The American Dream! ...and our stock market, economy, leadership, military, border security, real news.
I'm not offended by what you say. I'm just glad that you're stringing words into sentences now.
thanks Obama
Your ears are so big when you stand on a mountain they look like trophy handles
Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.
I thought of you today. It reminded me to take the garbage out.
Here's 20 cents, call all your friends and give me back the change.
If stupidity was painful, you'd be in agony
@realdonaldtrump Still lower than the last two January jobs reports under President Obama.
I don’t know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.
@realDonaldTrump @business trump is not the majority he is a liar & manipulator
@realDonaldTrump @business gimme a break not your doing dumpy. You are a disaster waiting to hapoen
If brains were made of gold, you and your family would be beggars.
It looks like your face caught fire and someone tried to put it out with a hammer.
what's wrong, her face reminds you of ur moma?
Hey, unless your name is Google, stop acting like you know everything.
You must have been born on a highway, because that's where most accidents happen.
@realDonaldTrump why bother it's just you patting yourself on the back and no issues answered
@realDonaldTrump   Come of it Matt, every one with more than single digit IQ knows BMO's economy grew those jobs.
thanks to Obama.  Just starting to see trumps rival "Obamas" hard work results
and yes your approval rating is in the toilet.  Everyone hates you.
Hi there. That report shows the effect of what as happened, back 6 months back in time sorry!
Hey Don The Con, I thought those numbers were fake!
@realDonaldTrump fake news
Thank you Obama. America continues to benefit from your hard work.
@realDonaldTrump Obama's last two February job reports were better, and you were saying how bad those numbers were.
@realDonaldTrump @business thank you OBAMA!
