Yes! That's right! And absolutely everyone has known this for decades!
Literally this is not a shock to anyone! Do you seriously think people wouldn't have done something about North Korea otherwise!?
Oh my god, watching your brain work as you figure out things that absolutely everyone else knows is actually painful!

How long precisely are we supposed to wait until you realize that Russia might actually not have our best interests at heart?!
I'd like at this time to apologize for not managing to maintain my normal calm demeanor and not restricting myself to facts and evidence.
But seriously, you have to be kidding.
Is there any policy to go with this tweedict or nah?
It feels like you might be trying to distract us from something...
#TrumpRussia
I heard they started working on your part of Mt. Rushmore.
Looks complete to me.
Ugh.
Your impeachment cannot come soon enough.
#MuellerTime
America could easily solve its problems by impeaching Emperor Trump.
Trump is a bigger threat to our democracy than North Korea, China, or even Russia. Internal threats are the most pernicious.
We have our own Dear Leader and he's currently tweeting from the White House.
For the good of our country, we need to repeal and replace the President of the United States.
ALL TALK, NO ACTION!
China has made ZERO progress with #NorthKorea, putting America in incredible danger with Crazy Kim Jong Un launching missiles
America will be forced to take the lead on #NorthKorea and and Crazy Kim's ICBM program
We know for a fact that #NorthKorea has Weapons of Mass Destruction
Obama turned a blind eye to #NorthKorea's Nuclear/ICBM program for eight years
#NorthKorea is the number one threat to global stability
Dude. Stop. USA needs NK to mantain military presence in the region, and China needs for extra space before the west. Both won't do nothing.
Not to mention that China is where Ivanka gets her bread and butter from Ur right.... Donny needs to chill! 
Reality check Easy-D, you make most of your Trump products in China.

Don't forget Ivanka and her knockoff shoes and handbags. Oh! and her flammable scarves!.
Poor little baby Ivanka selling her horrid knockoffs to unsuspecting buyers.  My ass!  She should be charged for selling fake merchandise.
I believe there are several lawsuits going right now, for the designs she stole. It is so obvious that they are ripoffs.

She could at least try to make her design thefts look better, but they are so cheap looking.
Look at the pics in this article. The inferiority of Ivanka's knockoff couldn't be easier to spot
You're such an effing whiner. All you do is go on Twitter and whine about how everybody else is unfair to you.
How about, for once in your life, you take responsibility for A SINGLE FAILURE?
After all, you said almost exactly a year ago "I alone can fix it!" Clearly, you're incapable of fixing "it".
You have a rolling disaster of a White House. You haven't gotten a SINGLE one of your 100-day legislative goals through Congress. NOT ONE!
You're a loser. Plain and simple.
Sad!
Mmk.
He's all over the map.
Bigly
These tweets are following his crazy-ass thought processes- smh
No point in trying to find any meaning. It'll change in 5 mins, anyway.
In fairness, the bird is smarter.
What is your thought process? "Since I can't play golf, I guess I'll stir up trouble with NK and China!" Is that how it is?
And since it seems your mains source of intelligence is Fox & Friends, I'm concerned about your judgment.
Is Fox & Friends how you are basing your decisions on NK and China? Scary!
Emperor Trump is the single greatest threat to democracy in the United States of America.
Hopefully he will start to trust the intelligence community more than Fox & Friends.
The next "ban" should be on you educating people
Because beauticians know so much about education.
Easy there. This person might know more than our secretary of education.
3 Years, 5 Months, 21 Days, 17 Hours, 24 Minutes, and 47 Seconds

Throwing this out there -how does he have so much time to tweet? how????
He does nothing else. He reads nothing. Studies nothing. Gives the same speech to the same people over and over. Lazy.
Wrong, he has more going on than anyone knows about.
Oooohh it's a total "secret"? Let us in on how he's got some grand plan. He's a weak, ineffectual fool with no idea what he's doing.
But he's...uh...um...but Hillary! Or wait, no, Obama! - said every trumpster ever in response
I think he must have had bad Tacos last night. Lots of "down" time today apparently.  Not that any of this is funny....
Did you say we would get tired of all the winning or the *whining*?

YOU are the President big guy, do something or shut the FUCK up already
You're going to tweet-whine all of us into a conflict with a nuclear power

Is there an adult in the room with this putz? Gen. Kelly? Hello?
With McMaster likely on the way out, I'm not sure there are any adults left. Not that would reign him in on NK anyway.
Rein* I really need an edit button.
Freudian slip. After all, Don acts like Henry the 8th.
I've been thinking about the similarities for months. Both 2nd sons. Serial adulterers. Multiple wives.
Shhhh, don't tell donny how henry viii got rid of wives he grew tired of.
Shit Henry the VIII was Gandhi compared to the Orange shit stain
...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!

Jews are banned from entering 16 Muslim countries, no one utters a word. Trump says to ban Muslims from entering US & the world goes crazy!




Oh so that why @POTUS is feared so much! https://twitter.com/trumpsterMG/status/891397342812938241/photo/1pic.twitter.com/oDXRApeDlf 
Yes they fear he knows...
Great choice with Gen. John Kelly for Chief of Staff.


New sheriff in town

The Mooch fixing the leaks.
We know these are bots, why still bring them for old time sake?
The operation didn't end with Trump's "victory". This virus spreads chaos, and those bots are part of it.
You might want to discuss your China strategy with the Kush. He was promising visas to some of those folks for some cash.  Just sayin
And if that don't work, maybe #TheMooch can get his buddies at HNA to work that out for ya:
See, we are the real geniuses, Don.
You are making me nervous, bro.

Dude..maybe enough for today. We can't handle all this winning.
I literally laughed out loud at this! Thanks @Alyssa_Milano
Ditto
Can someone please slip him a tranquilizer or something before he provokes WW3
Melting down
Or we should just say YOU'RE FIRED!
When are you going to learn that issues of international politics and economics are ... complicated?  Um ..... never.
We are tired of your Angry Grandpa tweetstorms. When is your cabinet going to repay your lack of loyalty by invoking the 25th?
“I alone can fix it.”
Donald Trump, June 2016

“I'm not going to own it.”
Donald Trump, July 2017
trump is incompetent & unqualified & with 6 months in it clearly shows! All he does is tweet, golf, whine & lie!
you would rather the fleecing of America continue with career politicians it is foolish to think they care
@snickerfritz04 @lonepatrick @WrmNewt @ReturnOfWeezer Oh look it's a trump humping cult member! #Cult45
Trump is worse than any typical politician. In 6mos he's spent more on travel than Obama did in 8yrs, he chrgs Secret Service (taxpayer $$)
A year and six months of digging through all of his past all you have is some vulgar words and a false Russia scandal
@WrmNewt @ReturnOfWeezer @ZeitgeistGhost @happyloner This ends with trump in prison! It's Mueller Time 
He done drained that Kool-aid.
This month?
Ever?
Paternity pending
Daddy never hugged him enough. It's all he knows.
You are an amazing negotiator on Twitter. Are you going to slide into China's DM and send a pic of Bannon?
Nope, he's just gonna slide into Scarmucci & call it a day!
THEN STOP MAKING YOUR PRODUCTS IN CHINA, YOU FUCKSKILLET
Fuckskillet: favorite new word
So we're clear: Does this mean they're currency manipulators again?
I'm still contemplating FUCKSKILLET. I'm really old and know a LOT of words. This one is NEW & somehow just FUN!!!!! AgentFUCKSKILLET!!!
It's just fun, right? Like literally hurts no one, makes 0 sense and rolls off with the right amount of punch. 
It's in my daily vernacular
STFU! Let smart cabinet members handle this. And please, get some help.
Smart cabinet members?

Amazing this is shared with pride. Literally makes the sharer look like a complete cult member with no capacity for independent thought.
I guess barring Trump personally admitting doing something wrong these zealots won't believe anything they hear. Scary.
And now he's attacking China. Good grief, somebody get that iPhone away from him before he starts a war.
...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
Unless, you know, he has every intention of starting war
Nothing else has worked getting MSM attention off of Russia and his criminal administration. #TheResistance
If @realDonaldTrump can tell the police to not be so nice, then can I tell the @SecretService to not be so protective?
I have reported you to the secret service for threatening the president
Ha! Ha! Ever watchful Satire Lookouts on the prowl! While your're at it don't forget to report KFC & McDonalds: They REALLY threaten POTUS!
KFC is a real threat to @realDonaldTrump.
'We will no longer allow' says the man who has products made in China. You simultaneously personify hypocrisy and idiocy. You're a disgrace!
You do not have any responsibility to blame other countries. Please be modest to all cititizens there in the U.S. first and be polite.
Apologies for our moron of a President. I don't think he understands how many lives around the world he jeopardizes with his tweets.
Threats all night and all day with you Donald.  Can you ever say something halfway nice for once?
Nope... 99% of his brain doesn't work!

I don't think Germany wants him either. Merkel is doing a fine job there.
"China could easily solve this problem!" This moronic statement beautifully illustrates how horrible this man is.
...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
Name one way Don! Tell us please
ugh i hate ppl who are just all talk
You're incompetent ranting is an embarrassment to the nation. We are the laughing stock of the world for having you as POTUS
Thank you for standing up against foreign threats! The past 8 years the world laughed at us, now we finally have respect again! #MAGA
Ha ha ha! What do you think China and North Korea are doing right now?
Real leaders don't depend on others to solve their problems. Lead, or get out of the way.

Fuck you. You're the worst president ever. Even worse than Dennis Quaid in American Dreamz.
The tolerant left strikes again
We don't tolerate a petulant child ruining this country.

Trump is tweeting instead of negotiating with appropriate parties to get ANYTHING done.
False. It takes literally 15 seconds to tweet
Sorry #MAGAmoron but your statement is a falsehood. There were 6 minutes between tweets. You just look stupid now or like an avg loyalist.
Trump Leadership 101: Step 1)Fail spectacularly @ something u said was "so easy" 

Step 2)Blame every1 but urself

Step 3)There is no step 3
Step 3 : repeat
Step 4 profit
I feel like this is the right way to go about this.
Xi is on Twitter, hanging on Donald's every Tweet? Oh right, he decimated the State Dept.
They just arent adjusted yet to a REAL LEADER who does what he says! Norh Korea will learn soon!
don't need a state department when you have twitter i guess
...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
Or an Ambassador to South Korea, it seems. Technically part of the State Dept so yeah, what you said.
China must be shaking. The queen of Mar-A-Lago has spoken
Attention #trumpflakes! Yes! You will go first!
Let's start with those three rotten silver  kids!
“I’m #DonTheCon sending jobs out to China!” 
 
#GAGA 
PLEASE, tell us how China could easily solve this problem. If YOU have the answer, why don’t you just share it with them. 
So far, you are ranting about the inability of China to solve the problem for you.
How about addressing the great Chinese capital control wall? That will get their attention. 
You're great MMA pundits.  But do you really think you are in a position to advise the POTUS, incompetent as he may be?
Someone has to do it. I feel as qualified as anyone on this staff. ;-)
RT @realDonaldTrump  Obama, Jarrett, Clinton, Kerry, Rice, McCain, Graham, Rubio, & CFR were responsible for #USA's failed foreign policies.
I could add many many more names to that list. Twitter created the "140demon" to prevent me from compiling a detailef & comprehensive review
But you and @IvankaTrump have Chinese made merchandise that you sell daily 
I think they have moved to India. India allows for them to pay workers even less. As not worry about pesky humanitarian regulations.

Trump got a Mouth gun  the most tremendous weapon in the world,lol
If you're such a great negotiator than why the hell are you wasting time tweeting and not actually talking to people? Oh that's right. LIAR

SHUT UP.... You're gonna get all all killed!!
Just like a 5 x DRAFT DODGING COWARD to BLAME another country for OUR problems....PUNK! @realDonaldTrump
If you think China will solve the problem you are no less foolish compared to your predecessors. It's not in China's interest to solve it
Here's an idea. Instead Of badmouthing them via tweet why don't you, I dunno, talk to them?
Careful with NK Cheeto... They ain't playing around. Your ego could sink us all.
CHINA IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE PROBLEM THEY & RUSSIA ARE BEHIND NORTH KOREA. THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING TO VENEZUELA & CUBA TO TIGHTEN GRIP ON U.S.!
OPEN YOUR EYES GET MATTIS CIA ONI DIA INVOLVED. SURPRISE ATTACK NORTH KOREA BEST. IN 8 MONTHS N KOREA READY TO HIT U.S. GET NUCLEAR SUBS IN

You are not a leader, Trump!
You do nothing but whine and golf.
Resign or be impeached, criminal!
Donnie, why are you calling the Whitehouse a dump ? If it's a dump it's because you made it that way. Tacky gold everywhere.
Trump drained the swamp/ sewer into the White House. It wasn't a dump before. It is now.

You are worst than 10 Kim Jong-un - it's not enough to rule America and now you want to decide wars for china? PLEASE leave us alone TY
what is the point of writing to him
Are you sure?  You're the same guy who said after a 10 minute lecture from the Chinese premier that you didn't know it wasn't so easy.

Thats all it is. N Korea is just China.
It is a matter of time Pakistan  becomes another N Korea as another Chinese Province
No. Chinese are not Muslims. That is a big factor. Pak will end up fighting with China. Chinese are also Kafirs like us.
STOP. TWEETING.
Why? Cause u don't like it? Why u here? Trump 2020!
Oh lovely. Taunt a nuclear power on Twitter. Not very smart.
Consider: the strategy of tension ploy is used to instill relevance where none existed before.
Please resign.
How do we know when a missile is fired that it's just a test? 
@AnitaDWhitee .@seanhannity .@dizzypam .@realPolitiDiva .@skin1diva
but we are MERICA and we have GUNS we should deal with it because we are GREAT

my Chinese friend and I think you should invite the North Korean President to the White House!! 
tweeting this shit is not diplomacy. nobody wants to hear your bad foreign policy over twitter. Are you afraid to pick up the phone?
We should just hit North Korea like we did with Japan in WW2
Donald, If this was an easy problem, it would have been fixed a long time ago.
Get back to me when you can point to North Korea on a map, Sunshine.

TALK can work if you are the "Art of the Deal" man right... show us smarty pants! Call Kim jong un and stop this craziness! WAR=LOST!
RT OBAMA, BUSH & CLINTON were FAILURES. We can't SOLVE PROBLEMS w/the same BAD POLICIES & SOLUTIONS that caused them. #USA @realDonaldTrump
私は、中国&北朝鮮&韓国を信じていません。
約束を守らない国だから。
生命を粗末に、扱うからです。
hey at least you know they tried!
Allow the Chinese people to finish eating their roasted dog then I'm sure they'll help out
@DarianNgreen

North Korea's ICBM will be exported to an anti-US Arab region state.
9.11 now turns into a nuclear missile.
Emperor Trump seems to have mastered use of the "Royal WE" to excuse his lack of policy and strategy.

#WEAK
This seems like #classified information being tossed away on twitter.

It is not for you to say what China should do!  Mind your own business!  Concentrate on your upcoming impeachment, Orangie!
Why not try full sanctions and completely isolate Nth Korea put them under full drive after 6 months he will be killed by his own people
N Korea had been already fully sanctioned and isolated.
Not much can be done.
Think you will find that food and other items are still allowed in for "humane" purposes I think it should be totally isolated
Good point. also that's why South Korean hate us.
They don't want us there.
Zero popular support.
We can easily win, but what be next?
What do you mean by letting CIA go hog wild?
The CIA collects and disseminates vital information to safeguard national security.. How does letting them go hog wild apply?
Diplomacy is not handled in 140 characters you tiny handed vulgarian.
Japan was once the most powerful nation in  Asia, until they attacked us at Pearl Harbor.  NorthKorean Leaders are not wise.
Solving the NK problem is not in the PRC’s interest. For if they solve it, the PRC will lose leverage with the US on Taiwan, Tibet, etc..
Just stop please.
Is thst what they told you thst they would help you just because Ivanka has her products made in China.
GO OVER THERE A BLOW THEM UP. OBAMA WAS A WEAK PRESIDENT NOW LOOK AT THE WORLD

Guess you can't solve it like you said you would, can you? Guess China doesn't want to solve it for you, it gives them an edge, huh?

来来来，中国当局给你。朝鲜两天解决。你行。
So did you put that travel ban on the DPRK because your about to go to war with them?
