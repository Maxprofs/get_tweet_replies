Don't pay those wicked, lazy public servants!  Why should you pay them when they're not doing their job?  They show up to meetings, to ruin.
I can believe it; when he took more than a week to get it done under you, it was obvious he was a phony and an extortionist. Vote him out!
He can't do crap. To much obstructing RINOS and DEMS The Swamp we gotta vote em out. We are with you Pres. MAGA 
Yes I believe it
Are you crazy? Socialized medicine is only way to go.
Another person that can't read. Bye Felicia
Hello His Excellency my President, me &my family wish you Merry Christmas &happy new year in advance in Jesus Name I luv u
As s politician seeks a higher office a national office in Roy Moore’s case,skeletons that have remained in the shadows on a local “good old boys” level will be dragged out by the light of day by the press     For an accused PEDOPHILE I say better now than never !!
You don't give a shit about anything. You're a pants pooper.
#StandUpToSabotage
Fyi all these failures are YOUR failures you know like you personally blamed Obama when the GOP kept voting everything down for Obama. Loser
Why would you replace it... When you could make it better....
Ha Ha Obamacare rules!
With the crisis going on with NK we're not that concerned with the ACA  your obsessed with President Obama deal with the current issue.
Let's see if he can get impeachment done
Well politics isn't as easy as you though, everybody (besides you @realDonaldTrump ) knew that health care is difficult...
@SenateGOP failing to #MAGA ! Disgusting RINOS! Vote them Out!
How long have you been saying it? Couldn't get it done....weak!
I can believe you are crazy for attacking everyone you need for your success. Work with R's and do your famous deals.
After your help with re'election,coal & appointing his wife @SecElaineChao 
to a cabinet job?
Seems,he'll NEVER get ANYTHING done
THIS YEAR!
Aren't you in vacation? Shut up!

Are you ready for #IndictmentFriday? I have my party hat ready. 
Can't believe it Donnie.. Could it just be that the GOP suggestions sucks?
Not one meaningful bill has been put on your desk & he says your expectations are too high? They clearly aren't used to getting things done.
They asked for the house, senate and presidency and we delivered.

Now they are failing us. GET IT DONE CONGRESS!
John McCain should be ashamed of himself. Not only did he lie & deceive Americans, but he was seen laughing about it. Sad!
He was laughing at you...like the rest of us...
"first day in office I will repeal Obamacare. You'll have great Healthcare at a fraction of cost. It's going to be so easy"
Let's repeal and replace Trump! It is time. This country cannot survive 4 years of his idiocracy. #25thAmendmentNow
Sup dude
*Whining
can you believe our President who screamed "healthcare is easy" couldn't get it done?
Both you and the GOP failed America.  Now lets get Obama back in office.
Not one person really wanted that crappy bill to pass. Trump will never accept the blame for anything!
@realDonaldTrump is a delusional malignant narcissist
Current Republican leaders should be replaced
Come to Galatasaray!...

Make Galatasaray great again!...
Must repeal and replace YOU - with someone who has some integrity...even just a little is more than u have and we're sick of your lies
McConnell MUST STEP DOWN Mr. @POTUS !  Get someone else in there to move your agenda forward NOW !
Ur the one who kept saying it. And it would be sooo easyyy. Hah. As usual u blame everyone but yourself. Never ur fault is it. GROW UP.
Keep putting pressure on them to have less talk and more action potus #MAGA
There are so many weenies in the Senate.  They are the problem, not you!
You're a looser
DTS
What we are going to Repeal & Replace is your fraudulent, treasonous, lying con artist ass !! #ImpeachTrump #FakePresident
what I Still can't get over that you are president, Screw Mitch, what about if America becomes great again  by Repeal & Replacing you 
First order of business is repeal and replace you and #EvilPence
#25ththe45th 
@VP #JesusKnowsYouLieMichael
#PutinsPet
#TrumpTreason
Mitch M has the smallest hands ever. Followed him into his dressing room & its true. Can't repeal & replace & can't pee standing up. SAD.
YOU said YOU were going to get it done on DAY 1, that ONLY YOU could fix it and that EVERYONE would have great healthcare. Belief suspended
#repeal period!!! Get the gvmt out of health care now! Everything they touch they run in the ground! Tires
Fire him.
You had the best plan. It would sail through the house. You don't have anything do you. Lying Rump.
What have you done besides tweet? What happened to that whole "I alone can fix it" thing?
I believe you couldn't get it done...#IMPOTUS
Bush league tactic. Blame others. Might work in a world you control, which is not THE world nor does it work in the USA. Lead...period.
3 Years, 5 Months, 10 Days, 6 Hours, 5 Minutes, and 42 Seconds
We need to repeal and replace the President of the United States.
Actually, a real President is in DC while the fake one is golfing away in Bedminster. His name is #TrumpChicken.
TrumpChicken would never provoke a nuclear war nor strip millions of Americans of their healthcare.
When is the last time Trump said something nice about an American public servant? 

When is the last time he criticized Russia?  
Trump's working vacation so far: 
 Provoke North Korea
 Confirm leaked classified intel via RT
 Golf
 Attack US public servants
Trump is calling out McConnell for not repealing and replacing while he's on vacation playing golf (and provoking NK).
All because McConnell half criticized him. President thin skin
Short memory Donnie?  Mueller 
I think you shouldn't replace Obama care
Excellent choice! Repeal Obamacare 100% by using the power of the pen...this Obamacare is a fraud and economic burden to the Tax payers USA
U so pathetic Donald
Must repeal and replace you
What we need to do is repeal and replace trump from the WhiteHouse.
I love Donald Trump.soon you can see .

@ChristianFraser Mr President you administration has not presented a credible alternative #Trumpcare plan.
Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal &amp; Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repe...
t.
That is because what was put out there was total garbage. Enough senators saw what a piece of trash it was.
Seriously, use a phone... You know he has one, right
Holy shit. Is he really still on this?! Does he still think he's sticking around?!
C'mon now. Trump has two brain cells. Problems is they're constantly fighting each other
Ha! "I'm the greatest!", "No, I'm the greatest!"
Carrie, you are the funniest person who ever lived.
I just followed you, simply based on your pic being badass Lyanna Mormont 
That's why I put it there! To trick people into following me! Thanks!
To be fair, i also followed someone bc their pic is Finnick from the hunger games, so...
You said that on day one you would repeal and replace.  FAKE NEWS again
No just repeal. Government has no place in healthcare.
he isn't a go-getter. doesnt talk like he has the energy to the job.
You can't keep expecting others to do your dirty work for you. Bring POTUS is your only job and you are failing miserably! #yourefired
You were (thankfully) no help
You are a sad, weak little man with an extremely limited vocabulary.
ARDeuzycse
What about you? What's your plan?
You lead the GOP. Don't blame Mitch alone! The trio of Ryan, McConnell and Trump prove ineffective and unable to lead and govern.
Most of the Senate is not fit for duty. Plain and simple. They need to be sent to a "how to work school".
Yeah I can believe that lol
He is a typical politician. All talk. No action.
you only care about it bc Obama came up with it. You don't care about the people you're hurting w/your vengeance.
Or repeal and replace McConnell!
Must replace ONLY if it is better, covers all Americans and saves money. Hurting people is easy and a sign of failure.
Yes! Hurting people helps noone
They only thing we need to repeal and replace is the current president.
Or not. How about you move on? Plus, who needs better healthcare after nuclear WW3? #justbeingpractical
The problem with our government is career politicians protecting their job instead of protecting America. We need patriotic Congress reps.
It's very sad and disgraceful!
You're still the biggest dummy president we have ever had
He's so lazy he has to tell his breath when to and go.
Lunatic,  America deserves better! What's this obsession with removing affordable medical care? The name of the Act?
I didn't believe that they'd let you run a country tbh. Anything seems possible now
I can't believe what a jackass we have living in the WH. SAD!
We have another just as big larger than life JACKASS his name is Paul Ryan!
You said you had a great plan. But you have provided nothing. Your only plan as president was to set a record for most golf played.
Mitch McConnell never intended to repeal and replace he promised to bring it up first thing this year and didn't. He is a liar  replace him
Trump wants everyone to be loyal and loving to him but he's not loyal to anyone! He should just resign.
Because Mitch McConnell is a Sheep in Wools Clothing just like his Buddy Paul Ryan !
That's the problem, he's all talk no action, put your vp heading the Senate like he's supposed to be...
I don't get it!!How stupid!!!
Repeal and replace Mitch McConnell
Drain The Swamp! He's The Biggest Swamp Monster! Mr. President The People Will Stand Behind You! Please Put These Criminals In Jail Start HC
The Majority Of All Government Is Organized Criminals! Please Get The D.O.J. To Start Prosecuting Them! Trust We Got Your Back! Just Do It!
Go President Trump. He has to move the President's agenda if he is a Republican.
YES...YOU CAN DO IT..MAKE AMERICAN BESTER
A quick reminder that this is still a Democracy!
GOPe sent Obama Repeal bill in 2015, good enough then & but not good enough now? Tired of LIES & Broken Promises! Vote out RHINO's! 
lol
@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan id say repeal and replaces the two usless cockslingers ryan and mcconnell
I completely agree and we the people are waiting for the commander and chief to bring us together with a plan.
PLS STOP ANTAGONISING #NORTHKOREA. NO MORE VACATIONS OR TWEETS. PLS DO UR JOB & PROVE UR A GREAT NAGOTIATOR BY NOT GETTING US INTO WAR.
Agreed, you would think after seven years of moaning & groaning that'd have a bill ready to be signed sealed and delivered by the president.
Mc Donnell, et. al. are part of problem and need to be removed.
YOU couldnt get it done, loser. #ignorantdonald
It's time for Mcconnell and Mccain to get to their rocking chairs and leave the running of our country to the qualified.
عطنا    الجيش   يومين   بس       يومين    بس     48  ساعة     نشيل   بشار   ونحط  حكومه    بس   يومين
Or
Weren't you the one who promised to repeal it in a day?
B/C it's wrong for your country, you have no plan that doesn't destroy and hurt the middle class. Which considering is most of your country
YOU PROMISED HCARE FOR ALL, Better covge, lower prem; not touch Mcare, MCAID. YOU dn get it done DJT so FIRE YOURSELF & RESIGN
Can you believe #45 said he could do better?! LOL He's the worst POTUS in history! His legacy is worthless #44bestPOTUS
Must be a big Joke by him
#VilePig @realDonaldTrump Are you going to see how it feels to kill all the Puerto Ricans first? B4 you kill WHITE Americans? #FOADTrump
You and @gop, #republicans are going the WRONG WAY↓
POLL: 78% of the public, including 52% of Republicans, want the Trump administration to make the #ACA work http://kaiserf.am/2wQ1y4C  
Where is YOUR Repeal and Replace Plan?  YOU PROMISED A GREAT PLAN.  Where is it?  AHCA is NOT it.
He couldn't do is job when @BarackObama was president. What did you think he would accomplish when an incompetent Cheeto became president?
Doesn't this mean that you... failed?
Stop blaming everyone else for your failures and trying to take credit that isn't due.
Maybe their is something buried in Ocare that will help him grow a pair? If not repeal and replace Mitch
You were the one screaming. You said you already had a plan. That's called lying 
#opFreedomRepossession
Can you believe Donald Trump who said he'd "drain the swamp" brought in many Goldman Sachs scumbags, didn't drain but made the swamp larger!
Pleas help Katy Ann Blanchard. A military mom hurt while on duty.  Thank you!
You had 20 years to make plans for health care yet you never went over to Mitches office and gave him your plans, why?
HAVE A SOLID PLAN.  DON'T RUSH THE HEALTH BILL.  FULL REPLACEMENT IS A MUST.  GOP CAN'T WORK TOGETHER BUT POINT FINGERS AT EA OTHER 
The people do not want it repealed..  maybe that's why it didn't happen.
No. Actually, I don't believe any of you because you are all liars.
Shut up whiny #Not my President
Sir Mr President Trump all this senior citizen in the senate are all in cahoots with one another they playing games #DTS SENATES
Repeal & replace Mitch MaConnel
Yea, like you had ANY idea what was in the bill!  Can you even read or are you just too lazy!
That right. Blame the senate. What's new. What did u do to help them? Inject direction or a single idea? NO. 
#WorstPresidentEver
I thought you were the deal maker Donny?! What happened to leaders barring the ultimate responsibility when something doesn't happen?!
Somebody has to light a fire under the Congressional GOP.
Go away
@MItchMcConnell ...at least i'll stop from calling Mc Connell a NAZI, but i wish he'd stop support for the Orange NAZI.
You couldn't get it done either Dummy...
Still just as pathetic as the first tweet.
So many establishment rep. Need to go.  Drain the sewer, we need to repeal and replace them!
there useless. Let's look for replacements so you can get the job done. MAGA!!
Just repeal it completely, then work on a replacement! Everyone will have to work on it after that!!!!
Repeal and replace Mitch McConnell and all like her.
Let Obamacare die and don't replace with anything. Government doesn't belong in healthcare.
Hands off my ACA! @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan 
Get McConnell out McCain out
I mean you are the "boss", right?
Time for you to talk to the democrats and negotiate to fix.  If you work with dems to fix you will win everyone over
Liar
Um no...YOUR THE BOSS....YOUR FAULT. ADDING THIS TO ALL YOUR FAILURES, IM GOING TO NEED A BIGGER SCREEN TO FIT ALL YOUR FAILURES. SAD.
What do you plan on replacing it with MORON? What is your plan? Another Military secret? WaterGate 2 is coming soon.
You made the promise and can't keep it. Looks like bluster and bullying have limits to their effectiveness. Knowledge works better.

A reform-D.C. party would be attacked with anonymous source accusations in the NYT&WaPo
The plan sucked. You suck. War will not save you.
Who can believe Trump said he alone could get repeal and replace yet he failed to consider the legislature?
