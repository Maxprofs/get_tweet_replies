I love America #ImWithHer
I support Hillary because she's insanely intelligent and I trust her judgement and experience to run the country
sources for why I'm voting Hillary? Why I'm the source for that lol
I don't have her SAT scores or anything lol but I've heard her speak many times. I met her once & she spoke at my college
Ever wonder where the stupid people live ..Go to a @realDonaldTrump rally the bigger the crowd the dumber the people are
secure borders, balanced budgets, reduce debt, bring back jobs, rebuild military, repeal replace Obamacare.So much at stake
so much at steak. Trump steaks
says the Hillbot.  74 followers.  How much does she pay you?  By the hour or by the tweet? Be honest
$0. You, on the otherhand look like a walking trump billboard. Your profile is ridiculous

Obama wants to "delay" and continue the insanity. Ill vote for Trump to promptly remove ILLEGALS 
wetback turning on your ppl 
The real way to hurt Hillary Clinton isn't with nicknames or mockery. Issues areher Kryptonite. IfTrumptalksissues,he wins.
LIAR! I was there, less than 500 people...it's over Donnie boy.

If you were "serious" you would be annihilating Clinton with commercials, speeches, robocalls, ect. U aren't doing that!
when you vote, take two or three voting friends. We need numbers, don't vote alone! Encourage your friends, Vote Trump

Your number have been WAY down this week - less than 3000 in New Hampshire, under 7000 (1/2 filled) in North Carolina...
It's a shame - you need to mix it up more, get off that damned teleprompter, really get after CrookedHillary and the Jews!
