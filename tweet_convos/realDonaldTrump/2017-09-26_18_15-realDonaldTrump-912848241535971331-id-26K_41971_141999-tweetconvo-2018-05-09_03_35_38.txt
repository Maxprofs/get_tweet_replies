Does President Trump realize NFL players aren’t protesting the anthem/flag, but rather police brutality?
Texan sportscaster Dale Hansen explains why athletes aren’t disrespecting America https://twitter.com/JMKTV/status/912526953508249600/video/1 …
These are some of the injustices players are protesting
Fox's Shep Smith: It's framed as players attacking the anthem, troops, and the flag… that's not what they're doing
Trevor Noah asks: How and when should a black person in America protest?
And it’s not just the NFL, here’s LeBron James
Jake Tapper: Trump called black players SOBs, but white men marching with Nazis were fine people
Do you think the President is creating more division in our country by questioning the First Amendment rights of players?
WE STAND WITH TRUMP.
Do not kneel to political correctness.
WE ARE AMERICANS!!!
We believe in you...President Trump!
President Trump: Please don't forget--DO NOT CNN! It's bad for our country.
THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO!
Thanks Cowboys....FOR NOTHING.
Well, only drones that follow the leader. Real Americans are still watching and giving Trump the finger.
Real Americans know that Trump is doing a superb job and give him the 
Blacks are so oppressed in America they have free housing, food stamps, black only scholarships, affirmative action.. etc yeah ok
Oh & Black only award shows, black only pageants, black only colleges &  scholarships... oh we are so oppressed 
It's 2017. As a black woman I went to college, worked hard & now I am successful. Guess what, my skin color never hindered me...
Well said Melissa. Wish many more would hear your message and stop playing the victims white and black. Congrats on all you've accomplished
Exactly the point. No one has too but many do. Those who don't are nearly always successful, those who do are not. Regardless of color
How do you say I'm blind. You don't know anything about me. I agree there are some issues. But your successful, how? Was it given to you?
I think it's safe to say that you are digging at the depths of this argument. I think you already lost and you know it
What you fail to realize though, is that there are multiple ways to respect a country.
For example, you can respect the country by respecting the constitution.   You haven't done this since taking office of presidency
You could have respected  this country by declaring Russia the enemy.
Oh like Trump and N. Korea?






If it ever happens no matter where he works I will boycott when I die my family will carry on my hatred for him and what he kneels for #MAGA
"and what he kneels for"
Ok so you're one of those "proud to be racist" racists. Is that acceptable now?

Dallas Cowboys didn't kneel during the anthem. Thanks for confirming this faux outrage was never about the flag 
With 32% reporting in AL ya boy luther is losing 42% to your breitbart backed buddy moore 58%, looks like he let you down and desert you.
Doesn't matter. Your real defeat happens 12/12 when even @ALGOP can't beat blowback of your regime AL elects its first D-Senator in 20yrs.
That 12/12 race looks close. But I'm confident  will happen between now & then to guarantee your political demise along with entire @gop.
You have the strangest idea of #winning w/all this losing you do ALL day everyday. ALL  has done since 1/20/17 is lose... #MuellerIsComing

What the fuck does that even mean? what is your point?
It is decades old worldwide Etiquette practiced at sports events worldwide, especially world prix, OLYMPICS
U R going to piss @usainbolt off
are you happy you found a black dude in a video that fits your narrative?
Hope and Scavino were working on this all day.
So true. We know damn well Donald can't embed a video himself. This is even more ridiculous if others are involved.
What do you think his staff think when they have to do stuff they know is completely moronic?
Some folks will do anything for money.
Like run for president?
So true!
We are truly fortunate to live in an era with @HillaryClinton to have @realDonaldTrump as @POTUS!
To be fair you can pick and choose all you want. Doesn't mean one person is right and other wrong.
Looks like Ameryca agrees with Lebron over you...
Bolt isn't even an American

Oh. So you know all the info that HASN’T been released? #Impeach45 #Treason #ComradeJackass
oh my god it’s like arguing with your racist grandpa
Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!  
“Oh yeah? What about USAIN BOLT?”
Trump translator: "Even this black guy stands for the anthem. All other blacks should too."
If Jerry Jones was black, Trump would demand the entire Dallas Cowboys team be disbanded.
Trump disrespects the flag by not valuing diversity.
Trump tears apart the Constitution, our freedom of speech, and our equal protection under the law.
Trump acts more like a dictator than a president.
Speaking of Jamaica, it's interesting that Trump would bring up islands considering how bad he has botched helping Puerto Rico after Maria.
Dimwitted DEMs thought Bannon & Gorka's WH departure was a loss got Trump! Hahaha 4D Chess & we're winning with Trump #maria #trumptrain
Trumps war with NFL & players is brilliant! It's a symptom of the culture war the left has waged on America & our values! Bravo Mr President

Let me just speak for all Jamaicans on this one: Please keep Jamaica and our national heroes out of your racist tweets. 
He spoke for me damn it  don’t bring us in anything
Hey Trump: way to lose AGAIN on healthcare. Loads of donors, I hear, are VERY upset. Can you pass anything? Probably not! Cc @BillCassidy

Believe me folks. Believe me.
Many people are saying.....
I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work.
WOW and you are any better with your words of hate. It sure looks like protest using the flag as their prop
Our national anthem is not a vessel it's represents the freedom of this country only to have it mocked by these overpaid loud mouths hs
and all those freedoms are what they are freedoms not to be used or abused. Voice your opinion but using SPORTS is not the way to do so
hey man puerto rico said they'll stand for the anthem AND build some confederate statues if you just fucking help them out immediately

Wow. A Jamaican has more patriotism than the whole NFL combined!
Yeah it's sad there are people from other countries that show more respect for us than our own citizens.
It's against official American flag protocol to use the flag in a logo. #TakeTheKnee
I'd like to see that and if so I would need to change it out of respect.
I still haven't found what he said
And there it is. Basing everything on ‘belief’ instead of understanding or knowing the facts...
Dude, it took me all of 3 seconds to find it. http://www.usflag.org/flag.etiquette.html …
This sounds more like someone talking about  YOU, but it's actually  YOU talking about #TakeTheKnee:
“Now you have this whole thing going and it’s a very dangerous thing ‘cause we cannot let anyone disrespect our country like that.”
You failed to #RepealAndReplace again, failed to get Strange elected, a failed putin puppet. You're a failed human.
You disrespect our country with every breathe you take. Your #fakepotus existence is the most disrespectful traitorous thing anyone could do
And adding more insult/injury to the numerous ones you've already committed, even you  #TrumpsAWhiteSupremacist
What other words are there for your self-proclaimed #CultureWar you've willingly shouldered than to call yourself a #WhiteSupremacist
AGREED
Oh please!  Why is a war poem our National Anthem anyway ? Shouldn't it he something more like, America the Beautiful "?
We are NOT a dictatorship and YOU @potus are tryung to mess with Constitutional rights. This newer protest #TakeAKnee , started for a
Peaceful protest for racial injustice.  YOU are gaslighting in your fake patriotism . We now #TakeTheKnee because we will not allow you to
Take away that right.
They're not protesting the anthem u bum.
U know they are
No. They're not.
They're protesting the anthem like Rosa Parks protested buses not segregation (*sarcasm*)
Is riding the bus the moment Americans take to pay respect to our flag and nation? If not, analogy don’t quite work.
The point is Kaepernick is protesting police brutality, not the anthem itself.
Also, Kaepernick stopped sitting and started kneeling out of respect for veterans.
wondering when his tweets about players kneeling to PROTEST AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY will end
You will be the best President for African Americans. Jobs, school choice will break the Dem cycle of poverty & dependency
And then she tweeted...
You've said you don't believe in exercise because we only have a finite amount of energy 
This is so hilariously weird
Sigh. But not unexpected.
I'm definitely not at all surprised
For the love of God stop talking and don't bring my country and countryman in this whole debacle
The respect shown by bolt was from 2012, when Obama was president
Translation: "Dear Usain Bolt, you are cordially invited to mercilessly drag me online. Sincerely, Donald Trump."
make that "dear usain bolt *and* Jamaicans everywhere" #takeaknee
Trump is dumber than Forrest Gump. Is everybody on his team so afraid of him that they can't explain things to him? Can't change a racist!
Healthcare loss

Strange loss

Can you say LOSER?

Flashback: Greedy NFL Pockets 90% of Breast Cancer Awareness Profits; Sale of Pink Items are Charity Scam

Love it
president Trump said of injured veterans, “They were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem”
What does Trump know about veterans or fighting in the military? They fight for freedom.
Trump is the commander-in-chief of U.S military
In name only. Zero qualifications.
Article II,Section 2,expressly designates the President as "Commander in Chief of the Army &Navy of the U.S according to US constitution
We understand that but that doesn't mean that he's qualified. He has no idea what it takes to be in the armed forces, let alone command them
It is the United States Constitution. You must abide by it regardless of personal opinion.
Exactly why Trump should not be saying these players should be fired in the first place. They are practicing their first amendment rights...
Let’s Honor Our Flag & President
Save  Picture, Make Your Header
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
These Good for nothing millionaire athletes are despicable. Kaepernick literally wears a Fidel Castro t-shirt. An murderous dictator
REAL soldiers took an oath to support the Constitution... NOT to force our citizens to give up their freedoms.
Lol amazing tweet.
Shout out Dan Scavino for the bootleg homemade video editor graphics

BUT WHY TODAY DENY SHIPPING WAIVERS FOR PUERTO RICO. 
YOU IGNORANT ORANGE ANIMAL
Kneeling is a sign of submission. An AMERICAN STANDS UP & fights for  whats right. They NEVER kneel & cry, 'oh ouch, fix it, fix it'
Yes! Kneeling is a sign of submission. An AMERICAN STANDS UP & fights for  whats right. They NEVER kneel & cry!
More Presidential?

He's not in America watching his innocent family members murderer by police & then have no justice for their killings.
TRUMP: "Look! THIS black guy is grateful! Why can't our American black guys be like that?"

You continue to support #whitesupremacy
Until #BlackLivesMatter as much as white lives in this country people will #takeaknee
How do you measure that, exactly? #TakeAKnee
When there aren't 2 systems of justice in place.
When there's some accountability when a black man dies by police as opposed to a white man.
Well how about when this was going on???
We have your back TRUMP!!!!!!!!!

BREAKING NEWS!!! The Chicago PD has changed all sirens to the National Anthem 2 force all suspects 2 quit running & take a knee!
Dear Mr. President,  PLEASE STOP FOCUSING ON WHAT COLIN KAEPERNICK STARTED and start focusing on THE PROBLEM THAT HE WANTS YOU TO CORRECT!
You don't even like immigrants
When did America become ungrateful spoiled brats?!! #  #Patriotism #maga
You do know he’s black don’t you
@KFennymore @KingJames @usainbolt 
Maybe we can trade lebron to jamaica gor usain mobing here.
Great men know respect!

That's a man who knows the value of America. Shame that the NFL does not.
You can tell he couldn't wait for the song to just end! #respectwhat
Yeah, unlike you, who keeps having to be reminded to put your hand over your heart...maybe because you have no heart?

Chuck didn’t even have to kneel in order to get his point across. He said “I’m off this sinking boat, ya’ll”.
Does that officially make him a “good negro” in you eyes, Donald?
your***
Sir, I m trusting on u
U will do good only
Amazing,big up for the respect bolt!
Yes sir 
Trump is trying to distract from the Kushner Email scandal.
Nxa lwabishi leave him out of this! Just leave Usain alone

Boom WAKE 
 Enough Said 
@jessebwatters @JessieJaneDuff @trish_regan @LouDobbs @IngrahamAngle @greggutfeld …
you dont respect our own National Anthem so why the hell do you give a damn about people kneeling? how did you even become our president?
You're making a big fucking deal out of sports players kneeling when you should be more worried about running the country #FakePresidency
Go to Kuwait once. They respect the US so much, that they squash any anti US sentiment immediately.
I think this speaks more of Usain's respect for diversity than USA superiority. Wish our POTUS could learn that from someone.
Sad when a foreign athlete has @ore respect for our flag than NFL. PROUD OF BOLT.
That was amazing. Thank you for showing respect to the anthem
God bless this man. Our NFL Slugs could take a lesson from this man.
Usain real athlete, awesome role model for today's generation, unlike punk kids in the nfl, and nba! Usain has worked hard for everything he's achieved!
He's not treated unfairly in Jamaica, #JusticeAndLibertyForAll! Which is what the flag stands for & if you're not getting it, #protest!

Mr. PRESIDENT 
CAN you revoke the NFLs Nonprofit Charitable Status and Make them Pay Taxes?
What a class act!
As a Jamaican resident, Usain Bolt doesn't live in fear for his life daily from US police forces.
What on earth is your point? Are you really this much of an idiot? Does it take practice to be this stupid?
A message from his team. Keep his name outta your mouth!
Please leave The Boss out of your politricks. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912848241535971331 …
Usain Bolt, Jamaican me proud!
@realDonaldTrump Get off of fucking Twitter and run this country (properly).
Good for him. He was brought up with manners and integrity.

That's how it's suppose to be. How sad our own NFL players disrespected our country and for sure dishonored the men and women tht die for it
Does he mean, "Even Jamaica's Usain Bolt," or "Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica" ?

Traitor trump family politricks: Losing. 
Any mature & educated person does that. That is d right thing 2 do. Mr. Bolt, u made ur country very proud.
You Donald are talking about Respect for the Anthem, when are you going to stop being in love with the Russian government
You support that idiot, Kali?  I thought you were smarter than that.  I guess I was wrong.  Goodbye.
Unlike you when you sh*t all over our flag by being a traitor with the Russians; giving away secrets in the oval office #ImpeachTrump
What a Legend... Respect!!!!
So you are using a black man as a prop? Kind of like when you say "I have black friends instead of friends
Haha stop protecting the DOD propagandizing of American sports for pro military sentiments.
You really are out of touch with reality you dnt know what respect is,ur the grand wizard of the kkk #traitor
He is true athlete.
God bless him
Well if these libtards had to live in some of these other countries maybe they would appreciate how they got it in the US of a
#NFL Usain Bolt to hold #USA national #anthem respect classes for #kneelers


Big whoopdeefreakingdoo!! 
This is what class looks like.
Video from last year BEFORE Kaepernick took a knee.
@Zetrolly Thank you Usain.
That's true

And he can really move. Good job
He's grateful why aren't you-NFL-NBA??? He did not even have to be asked! He demanded it!!!
OUR athletes have joined the progressive left and they will be sorry!
There’s a real man #NotKaepernick #BoycottNFL #USAOneNationUnderGod #StandForTheFlag 
Someone please start a 'Flio Off The NFL Sunday'!  Show the NFL the little guy has power. Sunday Oct 8 all day
Perhaps PoC are RESPECTED in Jamaica; unlike HERE.
yeah, keep flogging this, we aren't forgetting about Russian collusion.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!♡
God bless you Trump! You're so important too us all!!!
How is Usain Bolt pertinent to your irrational argument against black American athletes?
NFL you shouldn't have done that dumb thing. Trump is on a roll now.
