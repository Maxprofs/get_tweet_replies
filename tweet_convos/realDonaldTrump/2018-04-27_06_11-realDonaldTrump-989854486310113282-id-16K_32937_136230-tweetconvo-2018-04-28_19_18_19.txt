It's a shame to watch the liberal hate mob attack Kanye for wanting positive change in America...
TWO WINNERS!
Umm did everyone forget this moment
Maybe he woke up & sees all the previous lies. @kanyewest can help MAGA. He is a very influential black male. Be a leader show young Black peoples to respect & back the blue - stand up respect our men & women in the military - respect our President @realDonaldTrump.
Kanye West can’t show me anything except how to be a sellout! #fuckkanye
My my my ...look how mad some people get when they aren't able to tell someone else what to do 
Look how asinine people appear when they comment on things beyond their comprehension...this is deeper than telling someone else “what to do” but you don’t know that, of course 
Good try....it's telling someone else what to do. Lol
Black Unemployment Under Obama: 16.8% 

Black Unemployment Under Trump: 6.9%
Don't mention legacy, that's an attempt to limit my free thought. #DragonSomething
Trump could make every black person a millionaire, stop all the wars in Africa, and people would still call him a racist. The statistics are in and blacks are striving more now than ever, because of @realDonaldTrump not @BarackObama. #Facts

Even in South Africa some blacks supported apartheid. Some American blacks are going to support racists and bigots too.

This is kinda racist.
Yeah it's now racist to appreciate service for the black community. What world are you living in?

The people that respond with only gifs and can't make actual arguments have very little brain power. You clearly fall under the category
I think responding in gif form is actually intelligent because you have to make connections with pop culture and also recognize the person you’re responding to is a lost cause.
That sounds like logic straight from the mouth of a clearly unoriginal, simple minded, SJW trying to make stupid things sound smart.
How bout instead you explain to me how trumps tweet was in any way racist? Justifying dumbing yourself down because you're not capable of critical thinking doesn't do anyone good
How about you read my thread where I already explained it rather than have me do it again for your convenience?
Kanye West does not represent black America
Now you have two african americans.
Kanye X Trump colab coming after that Cudi album drops.
Today is #DragonEnergyFriday!

Trump Takes Undue Credit on Black Unemployment - http://FactCheck.org 
Need to put more black issues on the table, you,re get more black support , from your one of black Republicans
Kanye West changed the entire paradigm by putting on that MAGA hat!!!
You should hear the conversations now. Total shift of mentality in many people. Kanye is not just another rapper. He is truly a cultural force.
A cultural force.....or #FARCE ??

I'm more of an M.O.P. fan myself
You know who matters more than Kayne ? James Shaw Jr, the guy who wrestled a gun from a shooter. Duck Kanye.
I could list several others? Notable men and women in history. Your point? Your claim that a heroic deed makes another invalid is sickening to me.
god you are so cancer
Liar #liar

#MAGA 
What about this guy! He’s a HERO! And you have yet to mention his name. All you care about are people that sing your praises.
???
They should all be in prison .

this is a step towards getting him to hear what we've been trying to convey for decades/centuries
You literally would not say any of this if he wasn’t supporting you..
You’re so full of crap.

The Black community does not claim your lovechild.
Yo shut up fam
@Martina ICYMI 

$342M in global profits, nearly $200M in share buybacks to reward international investors, 1 shuttered American plant and 160 lost American jobs. Make no mistake, that is the legacy of the #GOPTaxScam. 
@kanyewest is trash, he's a industry tool. He just killed his legacy, RIP. @chancetherapper & @darrellscott they really don't get it but they slave for the cause. I wonder how stupid to they feel that Sir Pissyface tied they thank you black unemployment, this what they don't get.
Yeah, boycott everyone for having different opinions!
Just the ones with ignorant opinions.
You just liked your own reply lmao.
Pathetic 
Only fools don't like what they say because 9 out of 10 it's bullshit. On the other hand I'm confident in my remarks & I like them. So in your case you don't like what you say & nobody else either, lmao.
Sometimes I wonder why there isn’t a IQ requirement to vote.. or one to allow you to share political opinions online.
You’re the reason I think of such things today.
Congratulations.

You think @kanyewest represents the black community?!!?

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! 
Exactly!  They know nothing about Kanye.  He is all about his coins and he is a genius at it.  His new song just dropped. 
You gotta give it to him tho. He's on point. 
Lol always.  I don't know what the hell the lyrics "poopity scoop" means yet but he basically is talking shit .   #GetYourMoneyHoney. #UseEmUp

u know who did a great service? #JamesShawJr ..  the black man that saved lives and stopped the shooter in TN!!!!!!!
You are so right.
I literally don't know what the fuck is going on anymore

Hate on @kanyewest all you want, but being on the good side of one of the most powerful men on the planet isn’t a bad thing 
Most Republicans know enough to kiss Trumps ass. It appears to be contagious.
Be quiet. Please.
I think the last thing we want is to silence the president. We need to know everything for the sake of the country.
In what alt-world did this non reality happen? The kitty  grabber-n-chief, didn't have  to do with any negotiations.His team left him out of the mix to keep things on an even playing field.
You gotta stop with this unemployment rate stuff man. Parading it around like “hey black ppl, look what I’m doing for you”. It dropped from 16% to 7% under Obama.
The unemployment rate doesnt mean anything anyways. If people stop looking for a job, they arent counted for in that statistic.
The love of money breeds ignorance.
WTF are you going on about? For the first time? Seriously? You always make it about you. Go. Get. HELP! Or not.
More than likely, President Clueless, @kanyewest feels himself slipping into irrelevance. This is just an attention-grabbing stunt. You know, like you've always done. He's learning well from the Kardashians that even bad press is better than no press.

Thanks Obama.
Just because a black person is saying it doesn’t mean that’s what it’s about. Sickened by the fact that trump keeps bringing up minorities only when a minority speaks up
for him. Pretty sure Kanye isn’t tweeting to help others, Kanye’s pretty chill keeping it about himself.
How is he the president???????????????????????
LMAO
You and Kanye

Lord dampnut or Tiny Hands, (whichever you go by) Where’s Mr. Shaw’s praise?
TRANSLATION: Dragon Energy!
Go away.
James Shaw Jr. is paying for the funeral of each of the four Waffle House shooting victims out of the gofundme monies raised for him.

Retweet if you agree that this man is a TRUE American hero!!!
Kitty  grabber-n-chief,stop trying to make Kanye the new civil rights leader.We trust him as much as we do you and that's not saying much,most ppl over 30yrs old think he's nuts
Bingo!!!! So on point! Kanye like the Toddler in Chief, speaks for send of only self....
Don't you just love how racist arse ppl, feel as if we need their help within the black communities appointing a civil rights voice for the people.
There are 3.6 Million black children in poverty in America.  Democrats @DNC are more interested in helping criminal illegal aliens than American children. 

Think about that... #DemocratsHateAmerica 
#CrookedHillary #BLM #ImpeachTrump
What great service has Kanye performed fornthe black community?

Low employment? Thanks, Obama!
Um, hello? FYI, black unemployment went from 17.6 to 7.8 under Obama.
It went from 7.8 to 6.8 under you. So that means....Obama wins! Facts matter. But nice try! 
Still went down... Both winners
Yeah but Obama won more
Immature.

Keep telling yourself this
The truth is always easy to tell!
Truth? What do Trumpers know about truth?
Here is some truth for ya!


The issue this hour- explain how trump is trying to control drug crisis when his own dr. Is Doling out ambien and painkillers without scripts? Can’t wait to hear the excuse you come up with!!
No excuse. The left just lies! And you believe the nonsense. Why do all you liberals live your life so angrily? You seem soooooo angry.
LOL
What do you think about Candace Owens? I think she and Charlie Kirk make a great team!

Name one song by Chance, fast!
..... I come from a long line of patriots. My grandfather died in Vietnam, both grandfathers fought in the war. My husband left for a deployment when our daughter was 3 days old.

This monster in the WH mocks everything the military stands for.
Black & Hispanic unemployment rates are the lowest in recorded history, CORRECT! However, he fails to mention it was trending down faster before he took office & he actually slowed the trend down. This is why you never just look at the current number. https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/576552028/fact-check-trump-touts-low-unemployment-rates-for-african-americans-hispanics …
That's not fair. We all know he can't read a graph.
Ya because the billions of dollars he made and you never will just magically appeared. When will people like you who will never accomplish even a fraction of the success he has realize how stupid they are to put him down when they can’t even see his level?
You have no idea what I have accomplished, nor what is my net worth. Just like you don't know what the President's net worth really is. You understand that's why he won't release his tax returns, right? Just ask John Barron.
“I’d never support anyone who has made a career out of hatred, racism, and discrimination. I’d never support someone who’d talk about Chicago as if it’s hell on earth [sic] and then take steps to make life harder here for the most disenfranchised among us.” - @chancetherapper
Kanye's playing you & you don't even know it. 
Lol
This is 'Legacy stuff' the rest is just White Noise!!

James Shaw Jr. is paying for the funeral of each of the four Waffle House shooting victims out of the gofundme monies raised for him.
"Legacy Stuff" 
WTF!!!!!! 
Thanks @BarackObama  for leaving office w/low unemployment rates that continued as your policies continued to produce results! Stop taking credit for others work @realDonaldTrump & name 1 policy that you enacted that has helped w/Black unemployment rate? Just 1! There isn't any.
Medgar Evers, Sojourner Truth, John Lewis, W.E.B DuBois, Rosa Parks, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr, and last but not least BARACK OBAMA, just to name a few that ppl think of as far as "legacy stuff". Kanye West, not so much. 
My girl is feisty 


More junk to smoke screen your imminent impeachment. We’re hip to you.
Kanye is selling albums..hes not promoting you
James Shaw Jr. performed a great service to the community.   Much more than Kanye ever will.   You can't even say his name.  You are a disgrace.   #Resign

I won't lie, big things ARE happening, and it's definitely been an eye-opener. But not, I suspect, in the way you mean.
Tell the people the Truth about what are sptlraying in the skies of the world!!! Aluminium, barium and strontium!!! You are trying to pull the wool over their eyes for your agenda and to bring in the new world order!!! You are not a leader!!! You are a puppet on a string!!!!
My boyyy
Please take Kanye and Stacey Dash in exchange for Eminem, my favorite rapper, lyrical genius and smart enough not to be conned by a comman
This mutha-
Donald, Chance doesn’t like you
KKKanye is a traitor to America, just like you. Both of you have Grand Dragon Power.
Kanye lost all respect. How can anyone support you with your lies, bullying, bigotry, and divisiveness? You have no moral compass and are a disgrace to the entire world. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat, or Independent ,  core values should supersede any politics.


James Shaw Jr. 

He is the 29 year old unarmed man who attacked and disarmed the Waffle House shooter to save his life and the lives of many others. President Trump has completely ignored his heroic acts.

Let's all give James Shaw Jr. a HUGE "Thank You".
Make it go viral!
Lol...MAGA people forget Kanye went on a little "vacation " and is supposed to be on vacation. You trust that bullshit you want to. But, as they say, birds of a feather, flock together. Or, rather, takes one to know one. 
And none of his new MAGA followers are going to buy his shitty music or his ugly clothes so what has he gained?
Hopefully a commitment to a psych ward....one where he can take a friend (Orange Santanicus).
@imelda_ndeda did you just RT this???
Grant, your Tl says i did yeah? ... Doesn't necessarily mean I agree though..
How can you RT what you don't agree with? 
Huuuh!!! You didn't just ask that
Cannot wait for your indictment!!
Thank you trump for ending the korean war and inventing rap
Kanye West? 
Mr. Dragon blood? 
You'd praise the Devil himself if he said something flattering about you.

Plz don't speak for chance or the rest of the Black Community....sincerely black guy
And a Black unarmed man saved the lives of many people by taking a AR15 from a naked White man, but he doesn't got nothing from your sorry ass.

Trump, I used to vote for whoever I felt was best for the job,  regardless of party. Now I will always vote against Republicans EVERY TIME. The party has shown itself to be an extension of the Nazi party. #impeachtrump #trumpisinsane #trumpisatraitor #trumprussia
His new song must be dedicated to you: Poopity Scoop!

What about honoring James Shaw junior Waffle House hero.
Glad to see him realize the truth. Kanye did way more for us than Obama ever did.
No, Dr. Darrell Scott doesn't get it -- we need a New Deal for Black America, due to long history in America, not an Urbanization Deal. Bring back the New Deal for Black America.

Sadly some people feel they must apologize for speaking their mind, having their opinions, expressing their thoughts.   

Would you apologize for your freedom of speech?
The minute Kanye gets on a stage and people boo him he will have an epic melt down. This will be fun
Rule changes under Obama (must work part time or volunteer or begin training for jobs) in order to receive SNAP/food stamps.

These changes forced people to work in order to keep the benefits.

Obama stopped people capable of working getting free food which increased employment
Course it's the lowest unemployment rate for Hispanic because you're sending them out of the country
Have you congratulated the young man in Nashville who stopped a murderer at a Waffle House?
Damn. @chancetherapper, you’re officially complicit.
MAGA, Mr. PRESIDENT
Why does it have to be about color?
We are all the same it shouldn’t matter what color our skin is . We are all human beings.

Some of us are Delores
Trump sucks! I'm white and he offends the shit out of me.
You’re a fool
can't wait for the sleeves to roll up
Yep!
Thanks Obama!
Slaves had 100% employment. What does a job mean when U can't afford school or ur home? U taking credit 4 policies enacted under @BarackObama. Addr the unjustice system jailing POC, income inequality, poor education in POC communities. Real thinkers aren't buying what you selling
Remember the “good people” marching and carrying torches in Charleston?  Kanye probably  disagreed with that statement, I hope!
Eyes should be opened to your continual lies and hatred. I get it.......you are appealing to your base at the expense of the rest of the world. You make my blood boil
Can’t have unemployed black people if the cops kill em first! 

@kanyewest for President 2020

No one who says “legacy stuff” will have any legacy worth a damn.

You do realize Kanye is as psychotic as you, right.
James Shaw Jr.

I feel like I lose brain cells everytime you post

If you live in Iran or outside of Iran tomorrow you will take part in the strike to support Kurdistan and to unite all your nationwide strikes.
You just have that jumble or you just talk

He’s as messed up as you are.
This sounds racist....somehow.
Before you take credit for black unemployment, look at what it was when Obama took office and what it was when he left. Honor what he did and you can take credit for your tiny piece. Otherwise cut the nonsense
Get it through your head that you're reaping the benefits from the years of Obama's doing. It has been going down. You have done nothing.
That shows the state of your eyes and the limited range of „sight“ and mind you got one more time.....  Sad, to use your words, Very Sad...
North and South Korea are coming for you.
Dolt.
What has Kanye really done?
Oh my god fuck OFFFFFFFFF
don - about the conspiracy - does Kayne know do you think? #TrumpRussiaConspiracy #GOPTrumpRussiaCoverup
Your on met with a Russian informant!!!
I don't have to boycott Key West or whatever his name, because I don't like him, never have. I don't and I never liked you either. And didn't vote for you! I detest you as a matter of fact!
I second that! And I think it’s 
Kenya wess
Should be Kaynie White-kardashian!
This tweet is to quote @realDonaldTrump  "Very dishonest and sick!"
He has been tweeting all day! @realDonaldTrump is a very sick and confused man
That he is. Unfortunately..
diamond and silk has done more than kanye!!!!
Can i get a retweet or share. Thanks
Is it because the song “Gold Digger” resonates with you?
Spoiler alert: Kanye hasn't done a darn thing for blk community. Sorry, try again!

You are some piece of work. You praise west bc he supports you. THAT is the ONLY reason. 

How about acknowledging a TRUE hero, James Shaw Jr. He stopped a killer from murdering more people. Oh but James is black & the killer is white, so that doesn't fit your racist paradigm.
He is a crazy loon just like you.
All of your supporters do! The greatest collection of people have come together in a United front that will make history 
Black unemployment has been steadily lowering since 2010. You’re not responsible for this; Obama is.
One racist liking another one
Time for the swamp rats to do their damn job. 9% approval rating..., shameful and embarrassing!

Saying Kanye has done a great service to the black community equates to stating David Ernest Duke has done a great service to the white community.

Geez, how did you get into power?
Thanks to this real President, the one responsible for starting the real noticeable difference in unemployment going down for all races!
Yes he’s put them back 50 years. You’d like that wouldn’t you.


??? u haven’t done shit but brag off of what obama has done
@chancetherapper this is why it’s important to think before you speak or hit send. Now he’s using you.
About black unemployment, excellent news and a continuous improvement since 2010.
What are the big things that are happening? Last person to turn on the black community was Bill Cosby. That’s working out real well.
 you disgust me.
Thank you to all who support America ... the Democrats are going to crash and burn.  If they don't eat themselves first!  Love #KayneWest and #Roseanne who have the courage to think for themselves.
Why is everyone so upset by this exactly? Kanye West's biggest claims to fame are being a rapper and being married to a woman whose biggest claims to fame are a sex tape no one wants to see and plastic surgery.
Hush little baby- dont say a word
I love Kanye's music, but must admit there's nothing to learn about him..
