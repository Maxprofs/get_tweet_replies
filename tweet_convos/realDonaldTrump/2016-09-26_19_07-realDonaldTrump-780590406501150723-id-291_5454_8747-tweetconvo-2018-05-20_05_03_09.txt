Hey @DanScavino may want to dial back the #racist @realDonaldTrump "I have a AA friend" 
I guess you forget that Hilary was talking about blacks and how their super predator?
she apologized & he still is a #racist - so that's still happening
Listen Michael Doocher, HC led with the birther issue as well. The only reason she stopped was to be SOS.
great strategy Misspell someone's name.  and present no facts. #lol
And I did reply with facts, HC hated Obama until she lost, then changed her tune.  FACT!
where did HRC state that she "hated" @POTUS or is that your interpretation?
I take it you didn't watch the debates 8 years ago.
So, he actually followed through on that particular donation?
Just can't get past yourself can you?  Smh. #TrainedMonkey
As usual, name calling is what you folk have to offer.
Name calling...racists, *phobe, misogynistic...you're talking about Dems right?
Anyone who isn't moderate has been acting pretty ridiculous. Shake your head all you want.
What? Not following, DT has a hist of helping those in need, who has HC helped with her $? #Zero
.@WeaverJim @FLNJ312 @AwkwardHandle @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump #ClintonFoundation shows less than 10% goes to Charity Ask Haitians abt her
Why is everyone's argument, "the other one's worse?" It's misguided.
please don't say anyone fell for this one. She is drinking water and there is a reflection of her thumb,not her getting sick
.@DanScavino .@realDonaldTrump 
@PhilipJLarge here ya go
You are the worst kind of idiot. I'm not talking about Hillary. Nobody is talking about Hillary or Obama. Defend the psycho
you found 2 propaganda photos. Trump is a liar, a slum lord, a career racist & thief, he has turned his back on the people.
I'm done arguing with someone who has an Alligator on an ATV as their avatar. You have been abandoned by Trump. Good luck.
so proud. I bet  he didn't have to pay you hidden money into a bogus found dation lol lol
@USATrustTrump @realDonaldTrump

... of families, disruption, anti-Muslim. That kind of rhetoric has helped to seed these clouds."
...which is a dog whistle kind of anti-black, the anti-Mexican, the deportation of 15 million people..
Jackson told host Shannon Bream But I submit to you when you do the birther movement on the POTUS...
He will put u out of business u race bater

@GMOM67 @realDonaldTrump
POWERFUL
Even in the 1st 20 Seconds.
He was never accused of racism until he decided to run for POTUS... #keepdigging #libtards
oh come on! He obviously meant another @realDonaldTrump lol
- This is the number one reason for racial tensions in this country.he Aniston no MLK.
Jesse Jackson is a complete fool.
go back about 20 years or so a day look at the relationship he has with AT&T before the split interesting
Jackson has always been. In it for himself. He took money from corporations to improve race relations
jesse jackson is a back stabber like romney, clinton & anyone who TOOK $$ from Trump only to betray him.Careful
Loretta fuddy very suspicious what happened to woman behind @POTUS BC? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WdVSZOq9Mns&feature=youtu.be …
@JamesABaade @realDonaldTrump #racist. And he wasn't even running for office! What has Hillary done? Talked.

Jessie Jackson should take Al Sharpton and just ride off in the sunset. No one cares any longer.
Trump will be a Great President.
Trump is not only a great Patriot, he is a great Human who is neither Racist, Mysoginist, Hypocrite or Liar.
Why oh why didn't he look at Jesse Jackson and ask for a thank you?
and you continue to push false narratives out despite the truth. You must have idiots voting for you.
Oh, when Donnie was a Democrat (or so he said?)
birtherism isnt as universal an issue as ppl think. Two people could give a rats a$$, Lester Holt n HRC.
HOW SOON BLACKS FORGET WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR THEM
her and Bill have 10,000 sound structures in Det. They want to give syrian refugees! Pay4play. WTF?????
you need to take that down!  He doesn't support trump and posting it is a lie!!!!!!
Has been!
You call this the right Temperament Hillary. So you believe in Slaves?
SHAME ON DEMOCRATES!
This clip should run on TV -- on the news networks and/or TV ads.
He was not called RACIST until he decided to run for the PRESIDENCY
why is Jesse Jackson even allowed to speak he is a immoral, riot inciting, sorry excuse of a human being
Jesse Jackson is a opportunist that exploits the Black community however he can #HISOPINIONNEVERcounted
Thanks I tweeted this but have under 1,000 followers. Now maybe it will  go viral with your large following!
@RichardTBurnett @realDonaldTrump  Donald trump is not a racist. Hillary wants to keep blacks down
This is great!!!!
trump is still polling in the single digits among African Americans and wont change anytime soon.
was think Jr had a pardon coming form his black brother ?
Trump does not just talk,like political rhetoric does! He walks his talk by reaching out getting things done!
he has always had a big heart for black communities and getting them jobs Spanish also. 
#please tell me I'm wrong we will be in a mess. We will have The thing for the next four years too many lies
Americans know democrats couldn't care less about the plights of African Americans and Donald Trump does
more ammo for.Teump bring it up throw it in her face
#jessejackson should be ashamed went from legit civil rights now neglecting inner city black neighborhood crime
this needs to be show more often and on Facebook
@unameitdestin @realDonaldTrump trump only became a racist when Hillary said he was to get blacks upset at him
I'll just bet Mr. Jackson would love to hide this. The truth has a way of coming to the surface
on Hillary Clinton: I know her, and she’d make a good president
Really Hillary? Jesse disagrees with you
#cnn
excellent 1988 30 yrs ago Mr Trump was reaching out to the African American community.

Nice deed. 

Trump in the green room before the debate #TrumpSniffle 

How about some supporters he hasn't paid.

Donald Trump effecting change even back in the day! Caring about minorities! Proof positive!

Don't try it Your Dad admitted he discriminated against people of color use the excuse that everyone did
No,  he's a bad bad racist because #SwillaryCUNTon says so....
He loved Trump when Trump helped him but tonight Jackson congratulated Hillary after debate. Makes me sick.
Yeah how old is this source?
saw charlatan Jesse Jackson at the debate
stop pandering to African Americans!! This means nothing!! Stop & frisk was indeed ruled unconstitutional!!
it WAS ruled unconstitutional.
True
Jessie should step up and talk about what HRC has done ... crickets.

I got him to give up the birth certificate..even if it were racist.
: Jesse Jackson on @realDonaldTrump - when he donated space for the Rainbow/Push Coalition. 
#DebateNight
you bozos are an alley of clowns for sure.
Trump says "Wait I need to Do this,but I'll Stop and Frisk ALL blacks because I'm SURE they will have a gun"

"I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume. Donald Trump supported the invasion of Iraq.” https://twitter.com/PolitiFact/status/775412456839446528 …
does Donald Trump know that taking Iraqs oil is a war crime. yes it is actually a war crime.
Trumps cocaine habit has him sniffling hard tonight!?

Trump in 2002 saying he supports the invasion in Iraq. http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/02/19/sc-gop-town-hall-donald-trump-howard-stern-iraq-invasion-29.cnn … #debatenight
racist Hillary who want to bring black men to heel, called Trump racist, and he didn't hit back on her racism.
Trump says "QUICK  I NEED to DO THIS I need a Vote FORGET THAT I think that Blacks are criminals"
Tired of hearing the story so many times: "providing free office space in 1997"  I guess so few examples.
Your other example:Mar-a-Lago open to all - $100,000 for membership fee, you’re in - no discrimination there!
Please STOP CORRUPTION RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERRIFS SOUGHT TO DELAY OBSTRUCT PERVERT JUSTICE
was hoping Trump would remind public that she "admires" kkk racist robert byrd who voted against civil rights
