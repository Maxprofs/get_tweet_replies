Thank You

Senator Lisa Murkowski

Not giving in to Trump's threats

Keep Fighting!
Thank You

Senator Susan Collins

For protecting health care

not petty ideology
So grt that Senator McCain helped to stop #TrumpCare

+ Protect health care
Senator Mazie Hirono is battling Stage IV Kidney Cancer

Still helping others
Trump is so petty

His only thought to Disparage

Never cared what was in any bill
Trump's petty blame game shows his true shallow lack of character

Not interested in improving health care

Nice work.
Repeal Obamacare, or risk the implosion of our entire healthcare system
Congress passed the #Obamacare repeal 60+ times when Obama was President, but they can't get it done now -- Unbelievable!
#RepealObamacare, because the American people deserve better than that sad excuse for a healthcare plan!
#Obamacare was designed to implode -- It was a massive scheme to enrich Obama's friend's and destroy America's middle class!
Obama was simply fallowing the Saul Alinsky playbook when he devised #Obamacare, the most disastrous legislation in American History
Congress has NO EXCUSE, for not having a repeal passed by now! -- Maybe their insurance company donors aren't letting them do it
I think it's time to SUSPEND ALL PAY and RECESSES for congressmen until they #RepealObamacare
If congress lost their paychecks until they Repeal, all of a sudden they'd get it done!









Go Republican Senators, Go!Get there after waiting 7yrs! Give the Kochs/billionaire lobbyists what they paid u 4

In his defense, he has no idea what they're voting on.
But we all forgot about the sanctions bill. Right?
I thought actual grownups were on twitter??  After reading these comments?? No wonder Twitter stock in plummeting. Don't even like coming on
Sessions said today that he was right to recuse himself. That means he said you're wrong. On FOx News. All your fans saw it.

Very SAD DAY For AMERICA! Those Sen should NOT GET REELECTED THE PPL VOTE 4 @POTUS & this was one of the reasonFECKLESS FEWMAGA 
Answer is #DRAINSWAMP WITH TERM LIMITS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We the People stand with you!
This is not a middle school pep rally, you empty souled black hole of exponentially increasing ineptitude. PEOPLE WILL DIE.
You're cheering shitty steaks & badly made ties & a fake University. You're cheering what you KNOW is a fraud but this time PEOPLE WILL DIE.

#SkinnyRepeal
@SpeakerRyan functions very well for someone without a spine. He must have good healthcare.  The #SkinnyRepeal cannot pass!
Toddlers in wheelchairs are pleading w/ @GOP to protect their care. People. Will. Die. This is real life.
This is my son. His name is Rowan. Everyone who loves him are pleading for his life.
How did it go?
did you do it sir did you do it, i'm scared to look, tell us what happened!
Do you have any idea what's in the bill? If one of your voters asked about it face-to-face, could you discuss it in detail with actual data?
I know the answer...here's a hint..."NO."
I think you guys forgot. Obama didn't know what was in Obamacare. Neither did Pelosi..  "you have to pass the bill to see what's in it".Lol
Hi Lora - I think you need to turn off Fox News and try checking out actual facts. Here's the full text of what Pelosi said:
If that's too many words for you. *Obviously* she knew what was in it. Her point was that the topic had become so fraught by GOP lies...
...that only after passage, away from politics, would the many benefits it offered become more apparent.
That said, she didn't count on the unconscionable ability of the GOP for continued mendacity...
...not the ability of gullible GOP voters like you to be their willing dupe even against your own interests. Cheers.
It would leave 16 MILLION Americans without health insurance!! Details HERE: https://goo.gl/PuFC3K  #SkinnyBill
Omfg this man is such a loser ... I can't stand him . Cripes almighty ! Heartless 
You DO know they are asking the House not to pass this garbage legislation, right? No. You probably don't.
He's like the tool who bet $500 on a football game but hasn't any idea how football is played.
So true.
You're a big dopey doofus and it's important that you know that.
You're going to have so much blood on your hands. And you don't have much surface area to spare.
That was ice cold.  Well done.
Failed.... again!
Did you watch any of it? This country can't maintain this level of crazy for much longer.
I'm just about to catch up! Been ready about it..... 
C-SPAN carried it live. Check out their feeds
I love C-SPAN quintessentially American 
Isn't C-span fake news if they show the vote didn't go his way ?
 Probably !!!

You can do better than what the Senate is voting on. Their bill would raise premiums and leave more uninsured:
A win on health care would ensure more people can get quality health care at prices they can afford. This bill would do the opposite.
The news cycle on a bill getting signed will come and go, but the impact on people's lives will last. Please reconsider. It won't be a win.
Aw, so sweet. Was somebody reading Dr. Seuss at beddy bye time, Donnie? #godoggo
Sorry to hear about your loss. Have you considered re-reading Art of the Deal?
Maybe a free copy for each senator?
And a Trump Steak!
Dearest. @POTUS • Your administration is a disgrace to our nation.
FU saboteur

Why did you seek the office without any understanding of the role? A decade from now you'll be on lists with Nero, Marie Antoinette, Pol Pot – at Queens-Midtown Tunnel

What an impassioned & detailed proposal. You've given it so much thought, done so much painstaking research. Such a wonder it didn't pass.
Ahhhhhhhhh. Fuck you.
These men and women aren't dummies. They will soon see the light: The only way to insure that we #MAGA is to repeal and replace--now!!
And they did! They gave America healthcare to build on, expand, improve. #SkinnyRepeal is no more.
It wasn’t great heathcare. It wasn’t even good. That was the problem. You promised: everyone covered, cheaper, better. You didn’t deliver.
It's hard to fathom that there are actually people that still believe him. No one can be that stupid?! #TrumpLiar
So sorry. Bye gurl.
Winning, you say ? 

You sound like the bad guy in a movie reciting exposition right before executing his evil plan.
And in the end, they did give America healthcare, by NOT taking away!
Go Republican Senators, Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare!
Thank goodness for @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski and @SenJohnMcCain - they knew this would not give America great healthcare.
How does it feel to lose so much?
You sound like you're trying to make an adult version of Dr. Seuss', "Go Dogs Go"... you should stop while you're ahead LOL
Cutting essential services needed to keep disabled people alive is not "great healthcare" Don!
Being a #TrumpFan is like being a #BamaFan if you're not one, erbody else hates your guts out #RollTide @potus
I don’t like you.
You're delusional, inept or just GREEDY to push this SNAKE OIL on the AMERICAN PEOPLE. #CORRUPT & #DISGRACEFUL BILL. - HI

All you do is lose.
They are all lying, corrupted shells! They are in Dems pockets & do not care about Americans!! They only care about $$they line pockets with
This isn't a game.
Sweetie, you're a moron.
Trump sprear-heading rejuvenation of US spirit. Veterans, workers entrepreneurs, business, all races love Him, because all love common sense

Left believes way to destroy W civilization now not class but multicultural warfare: Ally with Muslim hate to take down USA; Build on ashes
Not at all what the left believes.  Therein lies the problem. You're operated on invalid intelligence.
Give rich people great healthcare
Thought u liked the cheeto n chief???
I don't like people who are mean to orher people
Me either. Good job
Really... you wouldn't know great healthcare if it bit you in the ass... #Resign #AMJoy Best job in the world? EX-PRES! Resign now!
You failed. Again.   #FailureFriday
Please remember that open enrollment occurs once a year only thanks #WHHumanResources
What was the result of the vote? I was catching up on #BigBrother. Did you see Chris DeJoseph in last week's HOH competition? He's so funny!
Dude realy
FIXED IT: Go Republican Senators, Go! Get Canada's plan and Give America great healthcare!
eat my ass bitch

They have bitched for 7 years. Now they have the power and crap on us tax payers. Give everyone in congress Obummer care!
Agree. Then vote them out, one by one.
But that isn't what you are doing. You are trying to repeal with no replacement plan ... that's not #AmericansFirst. That is #Trump4Trump
Pity the GOP has such a loser as its mascot. #theworldlaughs
We'll take the same health insurance that Congress has, thanks.
Republican Senators Losers. Replace with Pro America Senate 2018. Can't come soon enough.
The correct response is "I will work as hard as I can to see that all citizens have the best healthcare possible"
As usual they are completely unprepared, thank you President Obama for americas current health care bill which keeps 23m insured!
See Republicans go. Nowhere. Go, Republicans, go! #ACAsaved(for now)

That is not their goal it's to rob health care and give the money to the wealthy and you know it.
Just can't stand that 44 was a GREAT PRESIDENT & you are a wanna be cry baby! #FakePresident #LiarInChief #Deplorable #TrumpRussia
Fuck trump
wait ..what? I thought you said 17 years. did you lie...AGAIN?
Let it totally collapse. But take away Congress exemption first.
GREAT HEALTHCARE??? U DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE BILL!!!! CLUELESS !!
Makes total sense as long as less = great.
@realDonaldTrump ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha FAILURE!!! #getrealtwidiot
*gasp* Single payer?! That would be lovely, senators. 
Should I be tired of all this "winning" you're doing?
your missing fixing Obamacare to become Trumpfixedcare. It's the only reason you lost my vote.  Same from millions.  U will be God.
@SenJohnMcCain does not listen to you or his voters. He is a liar of the first magnitude and an embarrassment to the Naval Academy.
Fuck you
Sick burn, Gloria!
Have someone explain it to you.
Ouch!!! That hurts!
#traitor
What a disastrous week. You've been the complete disaster that you spoke of during the campaign. Try to be a real leader! When do we win?
You mean the health care plan that makes being a woman a pre-existing condition?
Are you tired of so much winning yet??  #FailureFriday
We need to get government out of our healthcare period 
Lmfao BTFO
@Morning_Joe Mr POTUS-I hate to admit it but Mika is 100% right...Today is truly #FailureFriday !! Get yourself straight
How did that work out for you, Trump?
Your cheerleading has done wonders
Agreed. Republican senators should go. And American voters will help them do that in next year's midterms.
Republicans are just beginning to get organized. Watch President Trump fine tune the Washington Machine. Lots of Slime & Gunk in the engine!
Well Donald, we're still waiting!!! What is your plan, if you really do have one??!!
Trump's delusions&deceptions has caused America to be seen as a dictatorship!This Tyrant fulfils prophecy of Daniel,chap. 7!A DAMN LIAR!
Strikeout again! Thank you, Congress, for doing the right thing!

Without doubt. While he has his elite health care. Something is wrong here.
EO zap those dogs w/Obamacare if they are concerned about us.
@POTUS providing great healthcare means socialized healthcare for all. Wouldn't need insurance. #ImpeachTrumpPence #treason
A mouth promising great things,akin to Adolf Hitler, who destroyed Germany &million's of lives!Like Hitler,Trump strives to spew hatred!
thought obamacare was here for 17 years? Afterall, YOU said it. hahahahaha
Wrong again Donny. American people do not want republican bills thank you John Mc
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha LOSER! #getrealtwidiot

You say give America healthcare? Yet trying to repeal with no replacement?? #WhatAmericaAreYouTalkingAbout ???
@realDonaldTrump Repeal Obama Care

 
Do not reelect the 3 rhinos!
Just let it crash and let all of the brain deads get to work or go to other socialistic countries
It's time to hold all Congressmen accountable!We demand that they change their Health Plan to ACA!Call your Congressmen&express your opinion
DO NOT REPEAL OBAMACARE BECAUSE TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE A REPLACEMENT PLAN!!! HE IS A ÑUT JOB! IMPEACH FOR TREASON FOR RUSSIAN COLLUSION!!
all they did in 7 years was complain instead of working on a incremental fix. You obviously don't have a plan or a clue!
Yes!!! Support our President!!
@MarieMa49685063 Republican Congress make up your Bill W/the Peoples best interest&only that in mind&go Nuclear W/No Regret
How about U?  No juice with the Party.  Pence is after UR job.  He knows Impeachment is coming. UR will quit and run! FAKE POTUS.
Hahahahaha
Oh trust me Donald your not getting re elected
luv ur new White House please stop tweeting silly things. You have a great second chance
[I should have been a cheerleader. I would have been the best ever. Best cheers. Best acrobatics. Gooooo Me!]
They weren't waiting for 7 years. They voted dozens of times. And failed. Just like you.
This ...
How’s all that winning there you human trafficking piece of orange ?
Repeal OBAMACARE as promised!
America has great healthcare, and a good ins plan that needs some work, not replaced with something that takes away their health insurance.
Sherriff Clark for US senate!!
Yes, go @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins, go!
How can you campaign on great health care for all and have no plan?
That bill was a POS. Republican robots voted for it without knowing what "it" was.Then you would call it great without knowing what it is.
They just did. ObamaCare is the law of the land and always will be.
How would imploding the system result in great healthcare? Are you hoping all the sick people die and the healthy ones don't need insurance?
Make America great again! Resign! Quit! Go play in traffic! Leave the country! #25thAmendmentNow #YouSuck
Oh ! more RINO's
#Easy fix for heath care
#Not for profit Insurance Company to give competition a chance to start  & grow 
#Monopolys will always forceAction
As a family of 5 paying over $900/mo for heath insurance. I don't see how the changes are going to help us.  #TrumpcareFail #jokeisonus
#Resign  already
A bill is not just an opportunity to put your name on something.
You lose. At least some of your party are Hero and decided not kill us with your skinny repeal. #McCainahero
Did you have "Pickle/Dylan's" totally real, not fake 10 year old sister write this cheer for you?
Republicans...what a f#&* joke!  7 years of talking crap and cannot get it done when they control the house, senate & presidency. Epic FAIL!
Mr. President, you should refuse to sign ANY bill that comes out of Congress until those clowns get their act together and repeal Obamacare.
I'm sure you have terrific healthcare.  I hope you don't injure your knee or wrist while you're cheating at golf.
This is obviously not the President's writing style.
How to Repair the Health Law (It’s Tricky but Not Impossible) -
You and I both know you don't give a damn about giving anyone great healthcare, only tax breaks for the rich.
Mr president you need to surround yourself with anti establishment people like gulliani, napalotani, instead of people stabbing u in back
Oops.
The bill was to start a debate on it, they weren't passing #Trumpcare. They were trying to cover your @$$ after all your #BiglyWhining
So, vote NO on Repeal.  We are already off to a great start witb the ACA.  Fix the parts that need fixing and don't f*ck with the rest.

Thank you @lisamurkowski for voting no on the health care repeal bill.
Are you tired of winning yet? (Asking for a friend) #MAGA

Let them work with the Dems and it just might happen. Keep doing what you're doing, it won't.
You aren't a sevant of god. You are a servant of satan. Nice try though..
Great healthcare would include natural Doctors & their solutions as an option Mr. president!
eat my foot
Yes go senators go... home! Thank you Sen Collins Sen Murkowski and Sen McCain- bully loses American people said NO!
Who are you taking to?  Your audience isn't a bunch of third graders. Please write like an adult.
We have to many imitation republicans! John McCain Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan for starters.
What gives Google or any social media the right to suppress free speech? We have a constitution! Can you take care of this?
Why not involve #Dems? Protectionism, racism and ignorance have NEVER moved the USA forward; only optimism and creativity have. Learn this.
John McCain is the antichrist....jealous and useless his bucket list to b POTUS will never happen...you'll never b Trump!
Great healthcare would be if ALL would receive it. Great healthcare is not if you shoot a perhaps shoddy one entirely for a lot, Mr Scrooge
In a country where some people can amass more money than the GNP of some states is, it ought to be possible to achieve a basic care for all.
Give us a full repeal. That's all we're asking. Our govt doesn't belong in the healthcare market.
Looks like throwing people under the bus and threatening them worked great for you.  You are pathetic!
Dear President Trump,
Please take congress' health insurance. Make them suffer through Obamacare like We the People.
Thank you
Wow, you're great, you work at mcdonalds?
thankyou Mr. President~ happy you are a mover and shaker~enough of the talk and more of the walk with our Congress/Senate~ POTUS is our hero
After 7 yrs of bitching & moaning, the GOP STILL can NOT come up with a reasonable healthcare plan.  SINGLE PAYER ALL THE WAY!
I do not think you know what real health care is.
To bad Orange Hitler seems like you have another loss to your endless list of failures.
If any tweet warrants being written in purple crayon it's this one. #simpleton #naptime
We already do. It costs about the same as rent, not $12 a month.
