I don't remember McCain campaigning on Repeal and Replace.....
Graham-Cassidy isn't Repeal and replace... its Repeal and go F yourselves!
Simply put the GOP was more focused on making Obama look bad than on making healthcare better!  McCain got this!
Take a second to read the bill and read this letter!
Take a moment to realize that everyone isn't as rich as you.  Most Americans are not money launderers!
Thank you Senator McCain

for voting your conscience against Zombie Trumpcare attack on Medicaid + health care
Conscience - Trump doesn't know about - Sociopath

Blocked Laura P. battling cancer - for commenting on health care!
https://goo.gl/q3B1Sk 
Trump calls Russia's attack on the election - "a hoax"

Sen McCain calls it - "An attack on American Democracy"
#JohnMcCain - #traitor #MAGA
Not just Arizona - #McCain let every #American down who no longer has insurance because of #Obamacare. 

He CAMPAIGNED ON IT! #MAGA
#JohnMcCain History Lesson

Fake POW
REAL POS

#TrumpNation #Trump2020 @POTUS #MAGA #RepealAndReplace #TRUMP
#McCain has been by far the most disappointing ‘Republican’ of my lifetime. 

How much does a ‘soul’ sell for nowadays? #MAGA @POTUS
#RepealAndReplace #MAGA
What happened to Congress and Senate would also be on #Obamacare? 

It’s socialized medicine and it’s KILLING US!

#RepealAndReplace #Repeal
PLEASE HELP @POTUS All the #Americans who no longer can afford insurance, the policy is worthless and too expensive or unavailable. #MAGA
It’s sad time In #American history when illegal aliens have better benefits than small business owners & self employed!

#MAGA @POTUS #TRUMP
And thank God McCain actually has the courage to stand up to Dolt45.
One thing I can say with absolute certainty: the cancer has changed his mind.
Yet Trump shows no trace of empathy & will badger a dying man on social media.
We know you.
McCain is a hero for prioritizing Americans' access to healthcare.
Does it occur to Trump that he has let America down?
Trump has criticized McCain more often than he has Putin
Trump has become the laughingstock of the world. Last night's rally made it worse. Americans deserve better. The world deserves better.
Trump is the best example that money never can replace education on personal level.
& money can't buy class or empathy either. Most unprepared, ineffective, dangerous POTUS ever!
Dangerous?  U are definitely confused. BHO gave $$ to Iran, 20% uranium to RUSSIA, now thats dangerous. DJT walks the walk while BHO talked.
McCain was successfully brainwashed in Nam
He is and always has been a evil traitor

Let's get rid of him
Thousands of dems are converting to Republicans daily who can blame them

Their party is nuts


Who wins, who loses in the Graham-Cassidy health care bill
The Graham-Cassidy bill would break with decades of progress toward improving human health,
New study shows GOP healthcare bill would leave 15-18 million more without insurance by 2019
Unbelievable.
Trump thought that McCain would vote for a   bill just because his BFF Lindsey sponsored it?  
He got fooled. Lmao
John McCain listened to his conscience. You should try borrowing someone's some time and listening to it—you'd find it fascinating.
I just hope enough constituents call @SenCapito @senrobportman @SenCoryGardner @JerryMoran @lisamurkowski & urge them to stand strong too.
Capito folds every time like a cheap lawn chair.  Same with Portman, who's a Trump lapdog.  Alaskans and Mainers must REALLY get busy NOW!
John McCain has sold out the American people for special interests. He's essentially a democrat.
McCain is a multimillionaire who lives in this palace... He doesn't care about our health care. He cares about kick backs from lobbyists.
Looks like a mosque.
Well, you know he's off the reservation.  Completely out of touch with the Republican agenda,
Yes, that is evident when he demands he won't vote unless Democrats are in agreement.
FACTS: John McCain was prisoner of war in Vietnam for 5 years & is a true American hero. Donald Trump dodged the draft because his FEET HURT

you can listen to those broadcasts on youtube
Yea YouTube is the place of true facts... Hahaha
When something is recorded and put on youtube to be heard...yes, it is a place of "True Facts" (which doesn't make sense)
BC his father was an admiral, N.Viet offered to hand over @SenJohnMcCain.  He refused to stay with fellow POWs vs Trump, who turns on anyone
 ok there bud   it's over   you can go back to sleep now
Yup. Just the level of intellectual response I expected. How about saving the reply button for when you have something substantive to say
That’s the courage that real heroes display.  It would be easy to vote with u. McCain is a man of integrity and you are a snake oil salesmen
Why don’t you actually do something and develop you’re own healthcare solution.  You can’t because you are unfortunately not smart enough
I am sure you are wishing you could make fun of his brain tumor but you can’t be the big bully you wish you could be now
All that!  hahahaha for real tho. #sad
I’m running against Maxine Waters

He has none!
Thank You @SenJohnMcCain and all those voting #NoGrahamCassidy! True patriots. #ProtectOurCare #SaveACA from #DotardTrump and @GOP greed.

The Maverick Strikes Again
Call @SenJohnMcCain 202-224-2235 to thank him for his No vote then call the other numbers to tell our Senators we're against #GrahamCassidy!
McCain voted NO to TrumpCare / DeathCare / #GrahamCassidy despite allegiance to GOP because The Maverick actually puts country above party.
This staggeringly bad bill will cost Americans tons of cash and many lives will be lost in the process. #KillTheBill
#WeThePeople demand a full #CBOscore before a House and final vote on #GrahamCassidyBill.
John McCain is a Swampy dude who lied to the people who voted for him.
President Trump was right on Obamacare, it is a disaster and it is falling apart.
Crowd booing John McCain at Trump Rally. McCain betrayed the voters.
I think you incorrectly directed this comment at Kodi when it should be aimed at the grousing dotard OP.
Oops - he's stuck in a loop. Somebody get a software engineer.
John McCain doesn't want to see Americans suffer, unlike you and the majority of republicans.
Shoving through a death sentence bill. Shame!
You campaigned on being the only Republican to protect Medicare. 
You lied.
YOU have let the American people down.
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain. A true hero! Something 45 will never be.
Yes he did and he was lucky to have his dad and Grand dad in the positions they were in! He is a coat rider not a hero
You're talking about 45 here, right?
Dont you wish, but no McCain
That story was fake news..you were told lies
Got him off because of thier positions in the Navy, where anyone else would have been CM! He is not the man he claims I couldnt believe it 2
@SenJohnMcCain war hero
@realDonaldTrump war coward
@SenJohnMcCain defender of rights
@realDonaldTrump destroyer of rights
#DotardTrump #illegitimatePresident #ImpeachTrump #TrumpsAWhiteSupremacist
No, Mr. President. YOU are letting the American people down.
Why do you hate sick people? Disabled people? Women?
I Effin KNEW IT. 6:30-645 poop time everyone..
At least he's regular. Old folks often complain about not being able to take a decent poop.
Amen.. I wouldn't even want to contemplate what a bound up DT would be. 

He is a curse and a fool.
If you mean Trump is the fool - you couldn't be more correct!
John McCain is a traitor to America @SenJohnMcCain
And to his constituents. He is a fake Republican. He needs to go, one way or another.
2012:John McCain blasts Obamacare & calls it an "exercise of Sleeze" now he obstructs an attempt to repeal & replace
McCain is behind the fake Russian dossier! He is a traitor that must be investigated for colluding with the Ukraine in the 2016 election!
Why won't this let us retweet it
Twitter shadowban. They love Deep State McCain.
My British friends tell me that the Minister of Magic tried to discredit Professor Dumbledore. I don't think it ended well for the Minister.
... or by @realDonaldTrump ? DJT wants to victimize 32+million of us by leaving us w/o healthcare! #NoGrahamCassidy #ImpeachTheSOB
He's got them on speed dial.
Awesome speech in Alabama 
As good as this one? 
Excellent!
Same Dotard, no policies, just empty promises and some egotistical rants. 
Redneck crowd loving to be lied to.
Yup. They be like...
Trump colluded with Russia and will be impeached, says Maxine Waters 
Everything Trump has done since taking office is illegal IMO. He's an illegitimate President. Please get him out of our White House!


John McCain is 100x's the man you could ever be!
McVain has evolved into a self centered egotistical all about me individual politician. He is the epitome of the descriptor RINO.
He's a treasonous war monger that sold his soul during Vietnam & is funded by Soros. Checkout the McCain Institute he won't answer questions
I am beginning to believe it
So you can't do Everything? But you Promised.
" I alone can fix it. " - Donald J. Trump
By "it", he meant his bank account.
No. John McCain did the right thing. You're nuts.
#your a loser with no facts#hater
*you’re* but please keep on trying to insult someone when you don’t know the correct your/you’re! You prove why 45 loves the uneducated!
John McCain never had any intention of voting for you. But here we are.
#nicetrytrump
This terrible healthcare bill is meant to enrich big corps. The AMA wouldn't allow it because it breaks hippo - 'do no harm'
#nicetrytrump
Sad how Trump never won an Emmy.
#nicetrytrump
go back to bed bitch

Make me puke with this BS!
Why Does The EPA Chief Have an 18 Person Security Detail?  Taking agents off investigations 
The scientists want to kill him. LOL. Love it.
Where is a mad scientist when you need one? Sheesh.
He saved kids you would have killed
Oh the Left.  How about all those babies being aborted left & right? Guess you don't see that huh?
We love you @realDonaldTrump
Always making excuses..

Can't get anything done.. Sad..
@cinders1313 @ChuckNASCAR  @SenJohnMcCain John McCain is a Traitor. He's a slimy lying DemocRAT!

You're just incapable of getting shit done!
Thankfully!
John McCain is a DEMOCRAT PERIOD! Part of the ESTABLISHMENT. WORST of the worst!
John McCain was the worst Presidential candidate in living memory. Completely useless with a total lack of judgement
Exactly the best part of that entire situation was @SarahPalinUSA
....and the dotard is awake...
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Yes  and RESIGN!
Obama still has more twitter followers
You can campaign on repeal & replace but decide not to vote for a bill that makes situation worse for millions of people
Can you focus on Italian football you know, and stop hating on the President. If only you can channel this your "hate energy" into sports
Can you focus on not telling people you choose to follow what to tweet?
Dictator? You're delusional. He's expressing his view. No one has the right to tell someone else to refrain. Whether you agree w it or not

Dayum sis 

Backstabbing John has disgrace Arizona voters for the last time, he will never get elected again. Backstabbing Jeff faces the same fate
@SenJohnMcCain Senator McCain is a disgrace to the GOP, Arizona, & America. Is there any way to fire a senator? McCain is rogue.  #MAGA
John McCain is a lying traitor. Everyone,  no matter how obtuse should realize this by now.
Counting the days till he's out of the senate! Hope his family is required to give back the dirty money he's collected w/pay-To-Play
Dotard says what?
@SenJohnMcCain has not let us Arizonans down. He chose to stand for his constituents, not with his party. For that, he has my respect.
He campaigned on your promise of better, cheaper healrhcare for EVERYONE. You have not been able to fulfill your promise. He stands with us.
John McCain IS NOT doing what he was elected to do.  His job is to cater to the citizens of Arizona - NOT NY or CA or any other state.
As a citizen of Arizona, I thank him for his no vote.
Well, aren't you a daisy . . .
I also thank him as a cancer survivor. Thanks 2 the ACA provision for no lifetime limits, I'm not broke after 18 months of cancer treatment.
John McCain the only true Statesman in the Republican Party.
Governor Ducey says he likes the bill because that's what his billionaire donors want him to say. He is a selfish & egotistical Koch puppet.
YOU are the one letting down the millions who will lose coverage under this cruel bill. DC cowards pushing the hard decisions off to states!
Talk about the Swamp, McCain is a Charter Member

#GrahamCassidy is awful bill that will cause 32M more to lose healthcare. 45 you should encourage bipartisan solution not simply "win"!
Your apologies to rodents worldwide.
Noooo... YOU let America down! You only want to repeal because Obama's name's on it, plus you blustered about it as a candidate.
But you can bluster all you want... the same way you do on every other item on the agenda. But you NEVER have a method - no plan to achieve.
When U say, "You'll see", & "You'll be surprised & happy", that means U have no specific plan. You're great at promising, but no follow thru
By the way,how's it coming on Mexico paying 4 that ridiculous wall?They R not paying?There's a shocker.Bullying them into paying didn't work
Mexico SHOULDN'T have had to pay for YOUR idea. So now you're going back on your word, & trying to burden us tax payers. U want it? U pay!
Your hypocrisy has come back 2 bite U on your big fat butt. Your "armchair president" statements from years past criticizing past presidents
are sooo ironic!Criticizing Obama unmercifully about playing golf. U've played more &cost us tax payers more in 8 months than he did in 8yrs
The rate at which you lie is absolutely mind boggling! And your "legacy" will be positively pitiful. You will then verbally attack those who
Thank you Senator McCain for being human 
.@realDonaldTrump This is what it looks like to serve your country well. You are a draft dodger that serves yourself
Last night, #VietnamWarPBS featured my capture in #Vietnam & other stories of POWs. Be sure to watch tonight’s episode on @PBS at 8pm ET. 
Thank you, Senator McCain!
You let an entire country down. Get ready to face the Mueller wrath! You’re going down Dotard
McCain puts his country first. Trump should be fired for being so consistently un-American and incompetent.
McCain part of SWAMP,m Jusge Moore better pick, dont let them rope you in Mr President, fight the swamp !! MaCain, Rombey, Ryan, McConnellL(
John McCain is the one who needs to be REPEALED and REPLACED! A total disgrace. #TrumpTrain #Trump2020
God is about to repeal and replace McCain 
MCCain is a TRAITOR!
Tick tock
Poor Meghan McCain had to throw away her career for her brain-damaged father.
(2) nothing but “Sunday Christians” all week go to Church Sunday! Nothing in the least Christian about ANY OF U INCLUDING BRAIN DEAD  TRUMP
"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.'" John F. Kennedy
THANK GOD FOR JOHN!!!
Now it's time for Arizona to let McCain down and put him in the Unemployment Line.
I'm a native Arizonan, abd he sure as fuck didn't let me down. Only you & the idiots who voted for you did that.
McCain is a commie traitor.
You're a disgraceful embarrassment to America that we will soon correct. #FuckYouVeryMuch #DotardTrump #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow
Wrong! McCain cares about the people he represents and knows the disaster this horrific bill would cause!
I've got a great idea. Rename USS McCain destroyer after a true American hero. Many to choose from. McCain opposes #MAGA.
No @realDonaldTrump he is a true American that believes you don't shove a bill through w no debate or due diligence. U let America down.
Testify.
To be clear- everyone campaigned REPEAL/NOT replace-Revert to free market- all current inducements to buy votes-indicative of$$health wasted
Handouts to states will be politicized leaving meager $$ for healthcare..Revert to private-free market.We had Medicaid/Chips low income help
@SenJohnMcCain has melanoma cancer 3X & it's now in his brain? Should he be voting on anything? @POTUS @VP @realDonaldTrump
: McCain, the SONGBIRD, the name given to him by his fellow prisoners 4 collaborating with their captors. Traitor then/now.
John McCain not only let Arizona down but ALL the American people
And you’re letting America down. Time and time again. It’s funny how your #racist admin must knock down ANYTHING the “Black man” did. #MAGA?
McCain is just another reason for term limits. He is part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. Not trustworthy!
Make sure McCain gets the same medical care as the Medicare victims. He can afford it; we can't.
#CCOT
Gov Brewer like Arpaio are as racist and repugnant as you! 3 pigs in a blanket! @SenJohnMcCain is morally responsible, heroic. Unlike you!
Because Traitor McCain is jealous of you and that's how he screws the US!
John McCain hates helping Potus more then he cares for the people. Let down all middle class! Email, call, tweet, McCain  Change your vote!
During the campaign you made me and others aware that John McCain is not an American Hero. This is what sticks in his craw !!!!
He’s been a traitor for decades.Nothing new. #Vote and REPLACE all in congress against #WeThePeople who voted @POTUS in charge! #64M 
He is screwing with you. Sooner or later you'll be able to return the favor. He is going to want something from you sooner or later.
That's because he is a decent human being #dotard
Mccain is motivated by his personal interest only.. He is jealous he wasn't elected when he ran for presidency... He don't  care for anyone.
You’ve let American down
He hates you so much that he's willing to screw his state & America, traitor @SenJohnMcCain
@senJohnMcCain #TRAITOR
#impeach
I THINK MC CAIN IS A TRAITOR AND DOESN'T CARE FOR ARIZONANS.  I'M AN ARIZONAN AND DO NOT LIKE HIM.  HE DOESN'T REPRESENT ME!!!
Well then @SenJohnMcCain needs to be recalled & fired by Arizona! He isn't representing the people of his state! #firemccain
@SenMcCain understands that repeal and replace only makes sense with an artfully crafted bipartisan bill that improves healthcare.
Anyone who loves his bill doesn't care about their constituents. #GrahamCassidy isn't a solution it's a travesty. You are unfit to serve.
No he didn't let us down, he STOOD up for us! Unlike Ducey and Flake!
McCain, like Hanoi Jane Fonda, is a traitor of traitors. I am so remorseful 4 stupidly supporting & voting 4 him for POTUS.
No one single tweet  pro-Trumpcare say something  good about that bill.

Thank you! @SenJohnMcCain
If you want your healthcare bill to pass you will have to put the house and the senate on Obamacare. We all our Americans We the People!
McCain needs to retire
McCain is a liar. Eveytime he's up for re-election  he says he's a conservative. Last election he ran on repeal & replace. All lies! Loser!
Dear stupid president delete tweeter and retired you're self from the presidency you don't deserve to be a president #fuckstupidprecident

Traitor JM. Censure his pathetic Arse.
YEAH!  He had no intention of supporting poor and sick people, young people, people with preexisiting conditions, and certainly not women!
McCain't is a Traitor !

Doesn't make the bill good, it makes the governor a horrible person.  1/6 of the US economy, with 2 minutes of debate, and no CBO score, wtf
John seems to hate every plan so what plan does he propose? Are the 3 holdout Senators for single payer or what??
And you let the country down with each word you tweet

McCain=Loser! 
Just make sure people with pre-existing conditions don't get screwed like myself. 90% of Americans have a preexisting condition.
That's because he is a hater of you. Jealous and a small & petty man. No hero him, a guy who starts the fire on his ship when at war.SAD end
Donny the LOSER.  Can't get a damn thing passed.  Hahaha
What's with you and McCain? He's a Vietnam war hero, as opposed to you, who referred to sexual promiscuity as your "personal Vietnam." Sad!
He didn't just let Arizona down, he let the country down
Make the Senate vote so it is recorded!  I have family in AZ; they are very upset with McCain!
Actually he did the right thing. Which is unusual for a Republican! Hero.
He saved our healtcare so should you reap what you sow sir he kicked your ass not bad FOR A CAPTURED WAR HERO SHUT YOUR CRAP DOWN SAVED AZ!!
I treated a young wife, and mom with leukemia, today. ACA is saving her life. You're all evil. History will show how evil you are.  
Why don't we have FREE COVERAGE for CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES? Why bankrupt families when we're the richest country and give so much away?
I love John  McCain he is so smart and intelligent I was he was our president!!!!!!!
He didn't campaign on repeal and replace with pos law that screws America
Time for the traitor McCain to retire for GOOD! He's a good reason for term limits. "Career politician" at its worst!
I think he's an undercover democrat'
No one cares about John McCain. Everyone hates U.
Donald j. Trump is stupid
|REPEAL & REPLACE| is one thing.. but the manner in which the process went & the bad bills =something totally different!!!! McCain's right!
#ShitStainMcCain doesn't care about anyone but himself
McCain has got to go! Arizona is being deceived! He's a traitor to Arizona!

Yes he did. He also betrayed the country. He should be arrested for his treason against America
Please have him arrested for high treason. He gave money along w/Graham to our enemies when BO was in shouldn't they be arrested?
John McCain is a good and proud man who has all the respect in the world. 
But you will never get any respect ever Resign resign resign
McCain is a jealous grudge-bearer who needs to be fully exposed as the traitor he really is.
I think he has embarrassed his entire family... I feel sorry for them!

I live in AZ, and McCain gained my respect.
