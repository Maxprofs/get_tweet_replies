I'm expecting something about how you lowered the deficit by $3 next
Im glad we are finally getting somewhere in the job department. Maybe this could be the thing that allows Trump to show his true adgenda.
@realDonaldTrump. give me a break! This is leftover from our president Barack Obama!
muaka travaille pour les peuple
Nothing better than ..."clear facts & figures"...something Democrats seem to give no importance to!!!
@realDonaldTrump Those jobs reflect on President @BarackObama not President Snowflake.
BULL SHIT!

FAKE NEWS
Sadly mine is going away at the EPA.  5 years left to pay off my house and retire.  Yep, I voted for Trump.
THANKS OBAMA!
Glad to see Obamacare adding jobs! Trump & the GOP are all wrong about Obamacare "costing jobs"!
@restore_US_now During the Obama years, the infographic would have read: McDonalds up 14%, Burger King up 12%, etc...
thank you @BarackObama your work showing...takes years before changes show @realDonaldTrump don't take credit for what's not yours
#fakenews
Thanks to Obama and the hard working democrats and few republicans that have brains and know how to lead!

@realDonaldTrump Government doesn't create jobs. Businesses do.
sorta, but we are trading air to breathe and clean drinking water in exchange 2 sure ways to kill many.
@EricTrump  Liaing Liaing Liaing !
@realDonaldTrump while building factories and burning trees and dangerous mining jobs are great jobs, can you hire more florists?
Yeah...wait until all the retail stores close down. Where are these jobs you're talking about?
Thanks Obama. If only trump can do at least half as well.
@realDonaldTrump This is the coat tales of OBAMA @OBAMA
too bad T-Rump had ZERO to do with that! Maybe he hired a few extra caddies tho!
@realDonaldTrump doesn't that go past regime for credit
You didn't create any of these jobs.  You are really giving yourself much too much credit.  What a joke?
You did all that in less than 2 months. What a superman! And con artist.
p.s does not look official
2014 3 mil new jobs last 2 years strong gains of 2.7 mil new jobs in 2015+ 2.2 million in 2016. #TrumpLies
Thanks Obama!
@realDonaldTrump this is the lasting effects of the great President Barack Obama before your manbearpig hybrid's policies start.
@realDonaldTrump um, what about all the jobs lost? JC Penny closing many stores. Sears before that since you've taken over. Explain
@realDonaldTrump Let's see jobs created in Feb 2015 and Feb 2016?
More than 2017.
Huh, imagine that.
DON'T TAKE CREDIT FOR WHAT OBAMA DID! your numbers of supports are way DOWN

@realDonaldTrump temporary jobs shouldn't count. These will be gone once Trump is out.
Still below the numbers Obama created in a historically healthy jobs month.
THESE JOBS WERE CREATED UNDER PRES. OBAMA and not the visitor in the White House!! Stop lying to the America!

Yeah.. under Obama's economic and jobs plan. Trump hasn't done shit but golf and help the rich. #notmypresident
