it is sad, Mr Trump... so sad
so sad..so so sad..
Let's all raise a glass of Iced Tea & Lemonade to a great player. And a greater man.  RIP Arnie
So did Jose Fernandez of the Miami Marlins baseball team. Both missed.
The sad news is Arnie was a gentleman and a humanitarian. You Trump are a manipulator and exploiter of human rights
: Sad, a true gentleman!
Great Ambassador
much respect to you Mr. Trump
This might be the best tweet you've ever made.
how?
delete your account
legend; #RIPArnoldPalmer  take the opportunity to offer condolences to the Fernandez family RIPJose prodigy
he said you cheated at golf and were never to be trusted.
Arnold Palmer discusses the honor of having his own villa at Trump National Doral.
bullshit. He was being sarcastic. Like trump is..
he sarcastically cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony? Lol okay.
bahaha and I'm blocked. I'm sure you're extremely confident in your argument though.
RIP Mr Palmer.. may God speed.
Even non-golf enthusiasts loved Arnie. A true American hero. How he will be missed. So sad. We were lucky to have him.
please answer, I have no other way of contacting you. Do you like Torn by Natalie Imbruglia?

Hell with debate prep. Hitler used to just fire a shot into the ceiling to get the crowds attention

ARNOLD PALMER DISLIKED YOU SO MUCH. HE WAS EMBARRASSED WHENEVER YOU WERE AROUND HIM. YOU ABSOLUTELY STINK. SMALL HANDS TOO

Congress Votes to Ban Further ‘Ransom Payments’ to Iran.. Another Bogus Fake Move from Spineless Corrupt Congress to Deceive the People! 
A LITTLE DAMN LATE...
probably died of disgust at your campaign

Honored to have met him years ago. Same guy in private as he was in public. He grew up in Latrobe, Pa. Mr. Rogers did, too.

UNBELIEVABLE!Anderson Cooper Who Has Been Caught Lying 4 #CrookedHillary Will Be Moderator In Upcoming Debates! 
Killing me

BUILD THAT WALL MR TRUMP! 
How come no ex employees or old friends endorse you?do they all have a sour taste?
6 bankruptcies
so what?
I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and crap out a smarter comeback than what you just said.
also he probably owns 100 LLC's how's he supposed to run all of them at once.
people don't understand bankruptcy

Does it include his numerous bankruptcy filings? Cheating businesses? Just give your tax returns
He already sent them to h@state.gov
Why not release them like he did his one page medical record? If they were released, we'd know
No, he won't be, because he died. But Trump is going to be President either way.
well that be on of trumps question 
Well you be sensitive when your in the white house.
thank you for breaking this story.
don't let devil woman frustrate you, that's all she has left!!!!  Don't fall for it, behind you all the way in Texas. ..
I guess you don't give a crap about Jose Fernandez because he would've been the first one you deported.
arnold was the man...
"ENJOY TOMORROW!!!!" Look forward to it! (I sing-I prepare & perform &LOVE IT!)
POSITIVE & STRONG 
u upp?
does a bear cum in the woods?
oh you can wrote personal sounding condolence tweets. Ah I see - not a "normal" person died.

Tiger had a chance at greatness like Arnold until he hooked up with pornstars & his ex wife beat him with a golf club!
He made golfing great in his times; people came out to see him on the coarses enmasse.
and u won't be anti-christ freak
.@realDonaldTrump #BREAKING #BreakingNews Arnold Palmer was a RACIST!! http://www.complex.com/sports/2011/06/the-most-racist-moments-in-golf-history …
You go Trump.  Love the way you debate. You are telling it like it is! !!!!!!!
May Arnold Palmer forever R.I.P.. He certainly was and always will be the best of the best..
. Wish u would join him.
*****VOTE TRUMP*****
Great guy, always appreciated the best qualities in people that others might miss. An important voice for the common man
May he rest in perfect peace! Condolences to his family and friends.

We could blame Common Core for Libs not understanding this math. But that would justify stupidity. 
your just saying you are because of the debate  he's not really your friend
Hillary offered by your supporters but NOT Isis supporters
this the same nigga on Arizona tea OHHHHH NOOOO LORD WHY?????!..........DO WE CARE ABOUT THIS!
Tomorrow, talk directly to people who HAVEN'T listened to you yet. Back to basics, Mr. Trump! U got this! @KellyannePolls
Hillary kicked his fat ass
she is a lyar!!!!
amen
He was a class act!
He was such a gentleman.  Far more than a great golfer, he was a terrific person.
true dat
she going to go after your family#stay cal#you got this
Profit and asset preservation are NOT dirty words

if crooked asks for your tax ret during debate just tell her you already emailed them over, but she must have "lost"  them
Did @KellyannePolls write that human sentiment for you? Because you would make anyone's death about you. #narcissist
New slogan for you to use. "If you haven't been part of the solution, you're part of the problem!" #realDonaldTrump
how is the war on terrorism doing Afghanistan ? Our American an Neto troops are dying there! Pray mr trump ! B-positive

Mr Trump, thank you for your kind remarks about Arnold Palmer.  We both grew up in a time when everyone admired him.

# crooked Hillary needs to release all of her emails immediately since none of them were classified what's the problem?
too kind to H. Bring out her rep as a LIAR.
I would start your debate by saying;
Hillary, i heard you were not feeling well, I certainly hope you are better now.
Donald Trump, You need to Slam Her About Benghazi. She speaks of Isis, Well That Is Just as Bad
golf is for losers!
Your political aspirations die tomorrow, Don, after Hillary makes a fool of you on stage. #ImWithHer #trumptrainwreck
And a Great Pennsylvanian and even Better AMERICAN. We will miss him.

A result of the disastrous Clinton/Obama policy! We need to take our country back! #AmericaFirst @realDonaldTrump
Really sad news: The great Arnold Palmer, the "King," has died. There was no-one like him - a true champion! He will be truly missed.
If he didn't have Obamacare, Arnold Palmer would be alive today. How many more must suffer? #MAGA
lmao idk xD
Did you stiff him too?!
hello
come on Donny, you couldn't care less. He was ashamed of you.
One of the Clinton emails on wikileaks talks about Clinton taking Provigil a powerful neurotropic. Just type in Provigil!
He would've really had a laugh at you. RIP

Wow I had no idea. I pray he was a Christian.
Sorry about Arnold Palmer. He seemed like a nice man.
