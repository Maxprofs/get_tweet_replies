FULL REPEAL ON HEALTHCARE IS A MUSTGET YOUR ACT TOGETHER GOP. BICKERING LIKE A CHILD. THE POOR GET ALL THE BENEFIT, MIDDLE CLASS IS HURTIN
Weird things happen to a program when legislators actively impede its operation, cast doubt on its future, and push its contributors away
I'm your fan

Mvtvt ummo
Enough SHUT UP ALL THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS BS
The O'Care is a product that ever will be defficent because don't give a good health Services. Indern a Lot people was triked with it.
This guy has Zero Integrity. Face of Treachery. Puppet of Soros. Usurper.
Yea McCain thinks he's a hero?  Maybe to the lobbyist that he sold us out to because of the chip on his shoulder with @realDonaldTrump
I pay taxes on money I dont make just to have health coverage! There is a problem with the system???

@lisaa171 HOW COULD YOU MOTHER
Obamacare allowed for 3 increases, GOP plan allowed for 5. Incomplete coverage is cheaper ... And risky
I myself should not be forced to have healthcare. Me and my wife went out and got our own dont need Obamacare!

If you can’t afford it, they took your healthcare from you. Get the Government out of this - “REPEAL AND GO HOME AND HAVE A NICE WEEKEND”
What's a good charity to donate to PR's relief, since you don't seem to want to help? NFL and one-upping  predecessor are > human suffering.

People angry because you are trying to snatch away their health care altogether.
Georgia Too, it's absolutely terrible. I can no longer afford to pay the high price and get nothing in return.
Mr president Donald J Trump,pls come to the aid of biafran's
#idiot
She's a RINO. I'm perplexed.She always votes with the Dems. Why is my President acting otherwise? Confused& disappointed.
RINOS Are 2Faced!
Your Badministration gas sabotaged Healthcare. 45 & GOP are a disingenuous lot.  Bring on November 2018 & November 2020. You're all OUT!!!
#liarinchief
Don't all Alaskans get money from the permanent fund?
Only because You #POTUSTrump  and #GOP  have tinkered with it until it doesn't work. Don't toss it.  Fix it!
don’t u get that’s the way it always has been?  Then fix it for real dumb ass Single payer if u do care. U said it before.
LOL
So much bullshit, so little time.
We, the people will overcome
I have been all over twitter to promote a YES vote. The only ads that show up are NO ads. LisaM. Needs to be out of a job, she failed us
Go Medicare for All, or the German model and save billions while caring for ALL USA CITIZENS! You promised the cheapest & best. DO IT!!
Komt er nog ooit iets sociaal verantwoordelijk iets voor elkaar in de usa
Insurance industry went rampant. They need controls so that the ACA would work. There are controls on Medigap, so why not for others?
Insurance Industry DIRECTLY Blaming You NOW - for the O Care Increases & the uncertainty your 2 year Bashing has created!  AM People KNOW!
Send you kids to war first before all others and all the other government kids to
and another loss for donnie "tiny hands" trump
Blame the insurance companies.
Last desperate stab at bribery
"McCain and others that voted down another debachle presented by republikkkans are listening to their constituents!"
Push single payer
Prove it.   Let's see facts from 5 reliable sources
Mr president Donald Trump, please remember biafrains they bolted for you
Mr president Donald Trump.pls remember biafrains ,we bolted for me.Thank's
ObamaCare must remain on to do list for 2018. Many of us said that Replace would be a STUMBLING block and it was!
Im donal trump and i just male up numbers that i dont admit to later and if pressed i get up and walk away...because im a loserrrrr
The choices are so limited. It's like throwing lives away. Can we take this to voters?
So fix it!!!!!! Don't break it!!!!
And what can be said for the more popular states?
33% in SC and my deductible is 13500 then they only pay 60% dam can't afford to go to the doctor. Cancelling my insurance paying cash
At least they didn't attempt to just take away insurance altogether from tens of millions like you.
Hard to believe you know Alaska is a state.
Not so much winning on that whole repeal and replace thing huh comrade? Good thing you never really cared anyway right? On to no tax reform!
But wasn't it your actions that made the prices go up with you sabotaging Obama care??? You hurt all Americans healthcare.
Government run anything has been bad , open the markets and let insurance compete nation wide.
You do know, that if Obamacare fails it will be your fault right? Taking active steps to make sure it fails, makes its failure YOUR FAULT!
If we want to save Puerto Rico we can rebuild. But, to sustain their economy we have to repeal or replace the Jones Act of 1920.
Use the word contiguace when referring to the states for which the Jones Act applies. It will save Puerto Rico and assist Alaska and Hawaii.
Wow!! I just noticed, you talk like Hulk does. "Trump smash, Democrats bad, Immigrants deport!" You should hear urself talk once in a while.
Nope, she has morals and convictions. This healthcare bill is terrible. Can't even win when you change the rules in your favor lol. Resign
@ABC @NBCPolitics @CBSNews @cnnbrk The solution 4 our country is #MedicareForAll! Best coverage; saves $2-$5 Trillion 1st 10 years. JustDoIt
After being bribed.
Who here actually thinks Trump has read even one page of the GOP healthcare bill or the ACA "Obamacare" he doesn't like
Trying to win back Alaska with a bribe? Loser! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP!
Send help to Puerto Rico! They are Americans too! #TrumpResign
Move to Alaska and that will take care of things
They will blame this on you. That was the plan and why the cost was kicked down the road until Obama was out of office.
Blah, blah , blah. No one believes a word you say
Liar.
that is great for all of us
Because you sabotaged the system perhaps?
Stop tweeting please..you are crazy.
You have no idea what you're talking about stop tweeting.
#Nomorerino
You care to talk about Alaska, but not PUERTO RICO. F U. B!*ch #Impeachdonaldtrump
Where do you get your stats?
What happened to respect? It's Senator Murkowski, to you.
Wherin Lisa Murkowski is offered a Sophie's Choice.
87% of statistics are made up
@realDonaldTrump shouldn't you be tweeting about the NFL who cares about health care
#PuertoRico
And TRUMPCARE would just make it cost more and uninsure more... who wins?
Wait until Obamacare turns into Venezuela care. 100's of doctors & nurses leaving that country. Socialist promise of utopia always fails.
They're leaving cause they are in a dictatorship and because they aren't poor they can afford to leave.
lisa not dumb enough to fall for your lies.
Sabotage works. When you do everything you can to destroy something, don't act like it's a huge surprise when it fails. Hypocrite.
Why do people keep saying that "replacing 'Obummer'-care is going to leave millions without insurance?"
Stop undermining the Affordable Care Act.
My single mother daughters insurance doubled when Obamacare went into effect. Just crazy.
If this bill passes, I WILL end up disabled because of my Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Liar, liar, pants on fire
You are horribly out of touch. You have no clue.
Ummm. Here in Ohio the working poor now have coverage... they are able to see a doctor before their problems get out of control.
That is why insurance, healthcare, and pharmaceutical companies need to be regulated. So that they can stop taking advantage of us.
You should make deals with the insurance company to stop raising premiums
Stop letting the insurance companies merge. They are not playing fair and you know they aren't.
PUERTO RICO Needs HELP. . NOW.
Sen. Collins votes "no"-you got pissed on again! Oh, wait-you like that!
Wish you'd repeal Obamacare. I'm tired  of the countless phone calls. No matter how many times I press 2 & block the #
One of the only countries where people have to declare bankruptcy for medical bills! You're a dickhead
What is VERY SAD is that YOU expect GOPers to sell their souls, on #INHUMANE bills, for YOUR WIN! Makes YOU #Unfit4POTUS reason #21!
OK, then FIX it -w Alexander-Murray bipartisan quick fix ACA NOW -NOT Graham-Cassidy cop-out giving $$s & probs to states! People suffering!
Video
But you bill doesn't fix that. Your only argument to choose your bill is that it is not Obama care. Read your bill. It does so much worse
Shut up you f"omg liar
You are such a liar! NO ONE believes you!
You’ve tried that lame story before. #KeepACA

Your plan does nothing to lower costs
Yes im so angry that people have to pay this much. There isnt any relief from thus sadness
We are proud of Lisa Murkowski, you, not so much.
Then why do they get to essentially keep #Obamacare under #GrahamCassidyBill with their bribe?
#WhatAboutPuertoRico?
Jimmy Kimmel: Senator Bill Cassidy “Got Caught With His GOPenis Out” In Obamacare Replace Bill.
People are always talking about what they don't know about.  Nobody knows what Obamacare is about.  They need to find out first.  Right?
Yeah it kept the crooked medical industry from getting richer

MCCain is a total Traitor, He said he'd Repeal Obamacare BUT HE WON'T,call his OfficeTwitter has me censored so, if you can please Rt this 
That's because ACA needs to be tweaked, NOT repealed where you take away health care from 32 million people !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@lisamurkowski this is a sideways act of bullying you. Stand up to him. #VoteNoGrahamCassidy .
Liar
Naw not gonna happen.
Because of the bill blocking tea partiers injecting their vitriol into what started out as an excellent plan. #WeThePeople won't let you win
#puertorico
President Trump, can't we just tweak Obamacare to make it work for all our citizens?
Insurance companies increased prices in Alaska and elsewhere because the law allows them too, due to no price controls. Sad!
Get your facts straight, idiot. Uninsured rate in AK cut in half, premiums to drop 26.5% in 2018, 93% in marketplace qualify for subsidies.
Then fix it!
#PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico #PuertoRico
God forbid she make people angry better to just let people die!
Repeal Obamacare
Unlike you she looks at the big picture! YOU DON'T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT AMERICA OR THE PEOPLE!
The ACA didn't raise healthcare insurance premiums, the private insurance companies did. #FakePOTUS, #DumbAssInChief, #IdiotPOTUS, SAD!
Fake news
I pay $750 a month for my AFFORDABLE health insurance and still have to fight with the insurance company to pay things....ridiculous
more fake news
And we've still yet to see you offer up a better idea! Quit pointing the finger and at least try to do your job, ok?
Stop playing games! You alone have made the healthcare unstable & insurance companies don't know what is going on. You don't pay your bills
Every working taxpayer who has a group policy at work has seen 500% increases over the last 4-5 years! Nobody ever mentions us except PREZ!
Senator Murkowski will continue to do what's best for Alaskans and for everyone. She can't be bought, especially by someone like you
Sorry Mr President, but sincerely...having NO insurance as opposed to your insurance is much better! You think!
Correction...but having insurance as opposed to losing it is 100% better than your proposed R&R bill isn't it? Smart!
Would've been even higher without O-care, same as in all states. A fact willfully overlooked by those that are opposed to anything Obama.
#MuellerhurryupandgetridoftheidiotthatPutinhelpedwinthePresidency
That might not have been the case if you weren't actively trying to sabotage the ACA. You and #GOP are to blame, NOT the ACA.
MAKE GOLDMAN SACHS FRAUD LOOT GOLDEN AGAIN. DISGUSTED I VOTED FOR YOU TRUMPET. NETFLIX $60B LOOT RACKET CONTINUES
Should sign an executive order forcing Congress to use the same Healthcare as the rest of Americans.
Is mind blowing how Rep talk about repeal BC is costly to care for our citizens but spending over 600 bil in def is okay BC this damn wars??
