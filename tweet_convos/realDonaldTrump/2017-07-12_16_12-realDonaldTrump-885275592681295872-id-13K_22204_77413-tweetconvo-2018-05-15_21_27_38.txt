Still carryover from Obama administration. Trump has signed no job-creating legislation whatsoever. Get over yourselves if that's possible.
Lolol more proof you don't understand the govt doesn't create jobs only kills them... The promise of good change is y business is hiring...
And businesses don't hire on promises of what MIGHT be, my friend. Proof you don't understand how businesses work.
Lolol we run MAJOR businesses. The entire stock market is business betting on the future. Business MUST b ahead of the curve 2 take advantag
Starbucks doesn't build a new store in a certain location because they HOPE the people around it will go. They already know.
Lolol mostly false... I know this for a fact. Demographics tell you a customer base exists... That's it. How many lose money? A lot....
I use SB  as an ex. They spent billions on R&D. If they're building a store, they're absolutely CERTAIN they can sell $5 coffees there.
Lol this is 100% false... Learn what awus is then do some research into any franchise chain you want.They rely upon awus 2 receive royalties
I wonder if any of those people take a knee for the flag?
Thanks, Trump, bringing this country down to an all-time low in the unemployment rate.
@BarackObama and his administration did all the work. You don't have to say thanks, you're already thankful.
But these numbers were fake during #barackobama ?

Thanks Obama :D . You do realize late economic growth doesn't happen over night. This is the payoff from previous years of work on his part.
More jobs in mining and logging where they're cutting down trees in habitats for endangered species. wanting to mine in our national parks

Within two weeks your world is gonna change.

How can you sit there are honestly take credit for this? Are you a psychopath? You know damn well you haven't passed any job creating laws!
You are so simple minded. You thinks it's just as simple as, Boom, if things go well, it's because of Trump, but if not, it's Obamas fault.
Hazanga!
Thanks President OBAMA 
Lies, lies, lies

You called our (BLS) jobs numbers fake news. These are the same numbers as Obama JOBS JOBS JOBS
It's kind of strange that we went from fake news to real news as it suits your propaganda better
Once the numbers start to go down, are you going to call our agency fake again?
Keep in mind that these numbers are being produced by a shrunken department because your admin terminated a sizable chunk of economists
Ugh and stop using us as a source, we're embarrassed by the primitive nature of your tweets JOBS JOBS JOBS
Obama got us out of that Bush made recession, always remember THAT.
Thanks, @BarackObama !!! You're not here to take credit for your success, but @realDonaldTrump has "taking credit" covered in spades. You set us up so well, we can't thank you enough.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! #MAGA ...
@realDonaldTrump please come to Canada and show @JustinTrudeau how a real leader rolls! Greatest president ever!! Keep up the good work!
You forgot to include lawyers on this list. You are responsible for the hiring of lots of lawyers in the D.C. Area.
Warren Buffet says you are wrong.  Should I believe a REAL billionaire or a #FAKEbillionaire?
SO MUCH WINNING!!!!!

Liberals only know about food stamps, obama phones and cash assistance....This is speaking a diff language to them 
Theres no such thing as Obama Phones. Bush was food stamp prez. The first year is the last presidents budget. Hes taking credit for Obamas
Read and weep liberal tears, even from one of your fake news media
Thanks, @BarackObama ! We'd be screwed if you hadn't have set us up with this success.
Some of us are still unable to get hired.  Unemployment is running out!!!  I worked over 20 years and now I don't know what to do!  HELP!!!
@davisindy @realDonaldTrump Where are you? field of skills? Maybe relocate if can Sell on EBay Do start-up 2 get by
I was an Admin Assis. Looking for any office job... can't move. Would love to start my own biz but it takes $$. Appreciate the ideas. :D
Temp work is a good segue to permanent job Unemployment usually has job posts & maybe new training
I've applied for MANY jobs, temp too.  NO ONE WILL HIRE ME!  Yes there's more jobs, but even more looking - I lose to the younger, prettier.
If you can work online, might be your best bet. Sorry you're having this problem
Just wanted to share that I'm working again, Fulda.  It's a temp job, but I'll take it.  Thanks for your concern and helpful ideas.
This is good news.  You had nothing to do with it: no tax reform, no healthcare reform, little deregulation.  But thanks for cheerleading
And that is THE issue for 2018
Aren't you glad Obama did all your work for you ahead of time with jobs

America is fucked. Capitalism has hit peak and is on the way down. Good luck folks.
Thanks Obama! 

Trump, glad you're enjoying taking credit for his leftovers.
Honey Bunny, try green jobs. You are living in the past, while the rest of the world looks to the future. Also you did not create these jobs
You da' man. Now bitch-slap those recalcitrant, questionable DC GOP slackards into following through on your agenda, Sir. They are sissy-men
Get rid of all temporary worker visas. That's an easy fix, & immediate job gain for US workers. If companies need workers, they'll pay more.
Hire me
All due to President Obama.  You will NEVER be as good a president as him or any of our other presidents. You are an embarrassment !!
You should get one.
Keep the swamp out!! We are proud of your leadership!! We are with you!! Twitter is sensoring many comments! Enemy is here! Build the wall!
good.  Im happy the unemployment rate is so low. If possible upward trending wages would be great, but more jobs is great
Thank you @BarackObama for building this jobs growth economy #Obama saved us from the #bush economy and is keeping us strong through Trump's
MAGA
Are you really this ignorant? The credit for all of this goes to Obama, quit bashing him and then taking credit for his work. #Sad
I give Obama policies credit for good numbers. It is a carryover. You haven't been in office long enough! No substantial legislation passed!
I got 2 new jobs since you been in office. Thanks for getting me out the dead end job I was in during the Obama administration
Yes #fast food
O.B.A.M.A. 
Where do you get your "facts" from? 
So if American jobs are important to you why is Ivanka's clothing line made in China?
81 months of job growth under and from President Obama
You have not been President long enough to effect this type of change. You liar. God I can't stand this guy. #NotMyPresident

It appears Jobs don't interest Democrats, handouts do.
You could add all the "handouts" up and they would be a fraction of the amount the rich republican tax cheaters are stealing from everyone.
Source and numbers please. The handouts are high.
Thanks to all of President Barack Obama diligence.
Thanks to President Obama's policies because you haven't changed anything.
