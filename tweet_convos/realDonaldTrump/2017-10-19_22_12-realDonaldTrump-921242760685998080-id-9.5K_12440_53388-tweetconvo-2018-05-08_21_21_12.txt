You're going to need more graveyards & a bigger DOJ. The suicide & drug problem is about to get a whole lot worse if this is passed.
Time to use executive order to borrow money from less important agencies to fund the military. Legal or not they could always complain about it after your out of office. National Security trumps any other concerns.
Here an idea. Stop funding war against Russia and reduce NATO dollars. NATO is probably the source of the anti-Russia frenzy.
UTTER DESTRUCTION and you tip toe through the tulips in it. Worse than Nero.
@POTUS @SenateMajLdr  Stop Lying...
God bless America!

The #POOR, who already #PAY_NO_TAXES, will STILL NOT PAY ANY TAXES; #MIDDLE_CLASS_FAMILIES WILL GET TAX CUTS. Thank you for your time Mr. President.
Go to bed, you’re drunk.
More for Rich & less for Middle Class.. #Sad
Oops! Looks like the #MSM anti-Trump narrative is busted again! #TrumpWins
What do I know about baseball you string bean wimp! And what I know bout banking. You present yourself like your a millionaire lol.
I'm tired of the talk get it done already
Massive Tax cuts for the  American people translated too #MoneyFunnelForTheRichest1Percent Trickle down really Trickles up The rest is LIES
#trumpfail
You forget their tax cuts for the rich not the American people
The only reason I still follow you is because I want a heads up to the end of the world...


Put on a dry diaper and go to bed.
Mr. President, how do you handle all this winning? It's getting to be too much!
Winning what?  Healthcare?...The Wall?....Releasing tax returns?....that's three strikes for loser POTUS!!!
The wall?  See the decrease in illegal immigration? Trump *is* the Wall. Winning.
Mexico paid for it?  Right?  He's spouts off idiot statements and looks like a fool.  Ronald Reagan, a real conservative, never did that!
Why are you mad? The economy's doing great. You have nothing to complain about! Tax reform is coming. Another win. Stop being bitter.
I love how you think I'm mad.   I love it...I have comedy material daily.  He's the greatest asset for stand up comedy!! 
Everyone one knows when you post the crying smiley, you're crying on the inside. Look at the great economy. Use data, not feelings.
Dude...you are a riot!!! Look at facts??? Look at the sustained lowest POTUS approval rating in history.
You’re both....
Another windfall for the rich. Once again screwing over your own followers to give the establishment a win.
wow, what a surprise!
Thank God!! Thank you.
Massive tax cuts only for the wealthiest. Middle class not among the beneficiaries. We know that. Stop lying. Fake potus.
Ahh the Tweediot in Chief.
Please go away
Impeach now
Answer this: why is it the Republicans (in recent history) who are the ones that always massively increase the deficit of ? NOT GREAT NEWS
Anyway as others have pointed out in simple diagrams even a moron like yourself can understand the plan is a big tax cut for the 1%, shown
Naturally this "so called" Great News of a budget will inflict massive cuts to Medicare
Because Republicans have become obsessed with destroying anything President Barack Obama did while in office
At the same time this will have the effect of killing ordinary  citizens which is another thing Republicans have become obsessed with
Conside the transformation of the EPA into the Environmental DESTRUCTION Agency, the rollback of environmental regulations will kill people
Clearly the Republican party hate anyone who isn't THEM and would prefer that the OTHERS will die
I wish everybody would get off your back you are doing great
Yeah, tweeting at 1AM, I love it! #goharddotard
1st step?? Talk lies and bullshit!!
#NLCS #Dodgers
Awesome
You mean for the ultra rich Americans
Specifically...what people?
Howa about no income tax..that would help
Senate GOP unveils budget resolution allowing them to pass tax reform without Dem votes:
Why does the tax plan cut healthcare??
The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 
FINALLY!! 

It’s been the SENATE holding things up more than Congress!

Before revealing #TAXReform how about showing those #TrumpTaxReturns you promised so we can see how the changes enrich #Potus and #Putin !
Why is Lara Trump reading transcripts of this *private* convo & why are you lying & saying there isn't a transcript?
Lara Trump, who does not work at the WH, says she read a transcript of Trump's call with Johnson's widow (at 1:14). 
If this is true, it's just another example of letting family members overstep boundaries!!
Jesuit Jews pedophiles and Cowards pedophiles

Voodoo economics part duex
LOL an extra $3k a year, in mid-Americans pockets?   WOW!  A WHOLE $57.69per week - city,state,fed taxes!  BIG DEAL!  Do the math folks.
Bullshit, man! The poorest ppl pay higher % taxes. Simple math & basic equality would fix the economy
AMERICA'S FOUNDATION WAS BUILT BY THE CROOKS FOR THE CROOKS!!
Tax cuts can only work if you balance them with equal, across the board cuts in Govt spending. Don't treat any group different.
Tax cuts for the poor and middle class only,please
Edit: For American rich people.
How many  billions do you want the taxpayers to spend subsidising a failed health care program?
LIES
You lying loser
The only thing they know how to do is hurt people. Conservative/rightwing ideology is alway anti-WeThePeople they are ProfitOverPeople
I think you are a Russian mole here to destroy America.

If MnM screws this up, POTUS will light him up.
Good that your little buddy Mitch is lying up a storm.
LIAR LIAR LIAR. Lol. You are so pathetic. Can’t even lie well anymore. 35% approval rating and dropping you failed business man.
I'll believe it when I see it. Cuts for you and your swamp friends I'm sure
Now we all should really understand the phrase "Money is the root to all evil".
...1.5 Trillionto the deficit. Cutting Medicare & Medicaid! So congratulations, you’re leaving your constituents behind! 2/
You mean massive tax cuts for your rich friends and you. Fixed it for ya.
ENJOY YOUR FINALLY DAY WHILE ON EARTH. RIP TO ALL FAITHFUL AMERICANS WHO BELIEVES IN JUSTICE FOR ALL.

What about Medicare
Massive cuts in benefits to the American people, you mean. S.S., Medicare and Medicaid, all on the chopping block, and tax cuts?

Massive tax cuts for your billionaire buddies, you mean.  Trickle-down economics doesn't work.
Kansas fiscal disaster headed our way.

tax cuts for the rich. 
liar
Get rid of the estate tax that only the rich pay, to benefit the Trump family! #TaxcutstosaveTrumpmoney
Lower the top tax rate on pass-through income, because Trump owns more than 500 pass-through businesses! #TaxcutstosaveTrumpmoney
Get rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) because Trump owed $31 million in AMT on his leaked 2005  tax return. #TaxcutstosaveTrumpmoney
I think I speak for all the non corporations by saying we are not impressed. Once the deficit explodes, what programs will you be cutting?
Not the "American people"...the rich.  Oh yeah, you'll benefit from that Donnie-boy!
GREAT , NOW DO AWAY OF THE HIGH DEATH TAX, NOT FAIR TO PAY TWICE.
401K investments better still be tax free

By American people you mean the wealthiest 1%. Cutting budget that keeps middle class healthy and educated in exchange for a $100 tax break.
Please look at what it is doing to the people who are working full time and bring home less than 30k a year!!! Help those who need, not rich
Way over due. BRAVO Mr President. Make America GREAT Again Thank you for your service to our Nation

For the 1% of “Americans” you mean! I am tired of “careering”the rich swines of America!

How about you mention our dead Country is broke. Your public doesn't care about tax cuts when we can't find work to cover living costs.
The FACTS are, THIS IS A TAX CUT FOR THE WEALTHY! Not the AMERICAN people. We have a Pathalogical liar in WH. FAKE POTUS.
You mean for the rich American people. That’s all you care about. And you’re ugly.
Time will tell. See if it really passes
