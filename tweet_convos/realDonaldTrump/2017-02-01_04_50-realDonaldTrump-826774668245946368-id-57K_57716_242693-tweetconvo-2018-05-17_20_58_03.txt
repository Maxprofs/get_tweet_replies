You are obviously not a reverend or a American.Secret Service should visit who ever you are.Such hate is not Christian.Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
If you look at my tweets I believe in Trumps keeping out ppl from terror countries that cannot properly vet them.Not a ban but a way to protect US citizens I think we are on same page when looking at your tweets!
I spent 6 years in mostly Muslim countries from 06-13 while I worked in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trust me, there needs to be a ban until WE get our shit together. We can't even file the right paperwork so the mass muderer in Texas couldn't but a gun. Just saying
Buy a gun.
I'm too old to carry!when younger used to.Don't want to have taken away by bad guys n used to hurt others.Do go to gun shop regularly an try to get younger good guys to carry!I buy cigars there.
I know. It will get worse before it gets better. I'm never too old to be able to pull a trigger. Stay safe.
You have called it a ban.

Then please leave our country.
gosh i wish they   would quit being big cry babys.
great tweet Mr President; there are even a few more that maybe you can add later
Crazy people easily can write good quotes!!
اقای ترامپ یه وقت غلط نکنی با ایرانیها سرجنگ بیای چون مشت محکمی خواهی خورد از ملت ایران
خب الان من دونالد ترامپ هستم؟؟؟
have someone read the list to you...73 from USA, 62 from Pakistan.  Maybe you need help with numbers?
if that were true then why not Pakistan ?
I go along with you Mr @realDonaldTrump
@TBDuce4 then YOU should keep yourself out of Our Country because YOU are a bad person with bad intentions!
Tell me: If Africans have a "RIGHT" 2 their land, + Japanese, Chinese, have a "RIGHT" 2 THEIR  land, why do "Americans" ...
I believe you, O Great Leader. Will it keep @SteveKBannon out of the country? #KimJongTrump #NationalDayofPatrioticDevotion
ojala @JuanManSantos fuese asi con nosotros!! Dejo llenar este país de venezolanos y aumento la delincuencia en colombia
Howe do you succeed to came in ???
when are you leaving then?
I have solution 2 Mexican problem: US can ship foreign insurgents to South Africa.
so sad
Your Ban plan is very poor thinking
thank you sir.  Keep up the good fight.
So where do we return you?
Then you get out of this country. We do not want you. We would rather have our Muslim brothers and sisters.
Then your u should leave.
quit tweeting you are not a private citizen!  This is not your PR machine!
lead by example then. You and your administration must leave the country now!
* this country
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" 
I totally agree with your decision and know you have your reasons unknown to us that is secret intel.
Do what you have to do @POTUS .Pres Reagan did by firing all the traffic controllers,, Keep the country safe!!
You'll never believe the great deals in this new website! …http://www.russiangoldenshowers.trumpsucks.fascist.edu.gov.org 
wow, unbelievable!  You should be ashamed of yourselves
"bad people"... define what "bad" means.
and blocking out thousands of innocent people into certain ruin in the meantime.
we need a trump ban. You are dangerous and with bad intentions.
@UberSalesDude Fear monger. Get over it
#snowflakesMelting
nobody is arguing.  You clearly called it a ban.
You called it a ban. And 5 year old kids, doctors and MIT researchers have been banned.
- handcuffing 5 year old children is about being #STUPID - you can't even launch buildings well, how could u run a gov??
.@realDonaldTrump no, it is a direct denial of aid we are capable of giving to other humans beings in need, you spineless coward.
they can fecieve Aid elsewhere. Like Dubai ? Saudi Arabia?
nah. It's a privilege of power to be able to take care of those in need.
it's a privilege to come here not a right
either way I would hope it earns you great pride at being able to extend that joy/protection to someone.
Only if we know they are safe to be here.  Not blindly letting anyone in.
the process can take up to 2-3 years of vetting
Obama did not care about vetting anyone
.@realDonaldTrump Is this what you meant by "Great Again?" Because so far every single person I talk to is frightened and/or angry. LAME!
Remember 9/11? Were you frightened and/or angry when that happened?
Odd how the comparison feels so astute. It's like our American values are being attacked!
BTW maybe you should visit Germany... I was there just 3 weeks ago and it's a mess! German people are NOT happy
I have friends in Germany. They are banning together because they fear what Trump will do next
"Words", right? Such a bummer.
you are obsessed with this guy
"this guy"
yeah the guy you constantly tweet about
Yeah where did this rando guy come from and why do we notice him?
stop it, oh my sides
LOFL @midnight trolling the shit out of an oblivious guy! Lmmfao
I think Roman forgot whose page he's on.
Out of what country ?
please donate to stock picks. if you donate anything to  ETH ADRESS we will send you a stock pick      .0xacc2d3e8cd1746ba73b371b247ae204e1d71ed5b
Too bad Trump doesn't realize he should ban himself!
Good
You have lucky but you don't have leadership quality.
Sorry Americans......
Mu bien dicho
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intenti...
Keep up the great work Mr. President!
All Muslims are bad. That's why you banned them. Got it. 

Glad your not Islamophobic, though.

No. It's about keeping Muslims out of our country. That's why calling it a ban--which you DID--matters.
good. Keep them out! I'm sick of getting bombed while you close your eyes to it!
I'm sick of you inventing fake reasons to jutify your bigotry.
and this ban is only for 90 days until the new security checks are up. How is it bad to better protect our..
@draftkingsrook @KellyScaletta @realDonaldTrump already had security checks up.
is putting up better security checks in place.
. @realDonaldTrump bad people lke the 5 year old I saw in handcuffs?
Who put him in handcuffs?
. @realDonaldTrump It feels like America has cancer and every morning we wake up and check the news to see how far it's spread.
Meryl Streep said something back at you sir
Well Mr President Hitler blamed the Jews with the same Rhetoric, and looked what happened there.
مرحبا كيف الحال انته رجل قوي وانا احترمك
interestingly, with all due respect for your Office, YOU called it a ban!
Ban, restrict, protect? They can all mean the same.
Full support here
really, when are you leaving?
Why won't you ban countries were actual terriorits come from? Oh that's right you do business in those seven countries.
Iran is the #1 terrorism sponsor in the world.
illegals should not be given court trials. They are not citizens. Kick them out
Iran is a terrorist country why are we going there and why they coming back and forth.
EXACTLY...WHATEVER IT TAKES...KEEP AMERICA SAFE. WE HAVE TOTAL RIGHT TO EXTREMELY VET ANYONE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY!
You have bad intentions, will you be leaving soon?
Who's the President of the U.S.? Sorry, we don't have one. If there is one we are ashamed to call him or it our president. It take smarts.
Kellyanne needs a vacation.  Her "alternative facts" (lies) & ignorance (Bowling Green Massacre?) are an embarrassment.
Hey... chat with Giuliani, he dropped the "Ban" word, just like you did.
Mr. President, keep up the common sense work. You are a huge breath of fresh air!
Thanks for doing your best to keep Americans safe.
Amen to that, let them put that in their pipe and smoke it, all of your supporters are proud of you, go Trump train!!!
and while doing that you can ban all the good people amongst them ^-^
so right Mr.President.I'm confused though I thought Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopie Goldberg n her crocs were leaving the U.S.
Just a lot of hot air from people who thought they had more influence than they'll ever have!
listen to yourself Donald and you can look at yourself in the mirror you've done the right thing
USATyPresidentTrumpFor Keeping Us All SafeEven The Ignorant That Don't Know What They Need For Their Own GoodMuchLove
everyone in the world is protesting against u!
soooooooo what. At least he is President until 2024
STOP BANING STUFF
We're not arguing. You referred to it on camera as a ban.
why are we NOT banning Muslim countries the idiot-in-chief does business with? BTW, same ones that sent 911 terrorists?
So when are you rounding up your posse and leaving?
what about the bad people with good intentions?
Agreed President Trump! American Patriots have to get Very Loud & Clear that we Refuse to harbor the Enemys Obama allowed!
:mms conflation of the truth : they want to divide us
like infants in need of surgery.
it's a shame we failed with keeping you out
BS its the same list of countries marked 4 war in the Bush administration & bombed during the Obama admin. Bush=Obama=Trump
dont let the refugees on the planes, and they cant get here. Ground the flights!
but look at the bad peopl you invited to run the country! #douchecanoe
you mean keeping Muslims and anyone that isn't Christian. But the ban does not extend to those
Lies & the lying liars that lie about everything #Illegitimate#FVCKtrump #TwoBitTraitor #PlasticPatriot #CardboardCommander
Then obviously it is Trump that needs to stay out of OUR country.
Unless they're from Saudi Arabia of course, one of the top terrorist countries in the world. Then you're free to enter USA.
i respect your decision to exclude all of those people from america but there are good people too dont forget about them  .
you do realize you have a boss now? We the people are your boss now. You're not a dictator.
look at all the white trash on your page. You attract the very best Donald ! Without your money your wife would be 0
try going to another country without proper papers let your visa run out they have the right to send you away we have none
They then buy $250,000 homes, they cost school systems ton of money 4 their food. They don't assimilate!
Do you really Understand what you said ,Trump 
All We need is Love 
How can it be a "ban" if it only lasts 90 days?
Then when do we create a ban to keep you out of America.
I think the bad person that needs to leave this country is YOU!!!!
I'll believe that when you ban yourself from this country. Not before.
children are NOT bad people. Sick children needing medical help are NOT bad people. GET IT RIGHT
cut their throts and make them pay
You must have been born on a highway, because that's where most accidents happen.
. @realDonaldTrump It isn't working.  You are still here.
There are tons of synonyms for bad, terrible and ridiculous. Maybe you should learn some to avoid the constant repetition.
/ yes, but we already have enough bad people of our own, we dont need foreigners coming into USA, need Marshal Law maybe??
Then why are you and your administration still here?
@edgecrusher23 defy that judge's order in Seattle he has no power how many judges did Obama defy
like Saudi terrorists?
You are a liar.  Check you facts the way you are forcing patriotic Americans to do every time U open your trap. U said ban
let's call it what it is a terrorist ban and it is good for America!
six tweets prior to this you called it a ban yourself. I hope you get impeached
what bad person ever came from those countries banned? NONE!!! ZERO!!!!
What??? You'd better do your homework again.
Maybe you should
Yeah the banning of people with the right paperwork suggests that you really respect that government departments ability.
Agreed, doesn't matter what it's called.  It's intention has merits, execution was/is rocky
Arab occupiers refuse peace w Israel so no 2 state solution, ONE STATE-arab occupiers get out of gaza, judea, sumaria now
Thank you! Finally a President that cares about American citizens first!!!!
you called it a Muslim ban. Would you like a link to the video where you said it?
you created the chaos with your poor "marketing" of the order. Sad!
Who's everybody? Your cabinet members?
then you and your whole cabinet as well as all the republicns should get out and let us have our country back. CLUELESS!!
again, if that was the case, you wouldn't be here.
why are those countries with "proven" terrorist involvement not included?
you are banning scientists, doctors, students, mothers, babies. #insane
What's the difference between you and a brick? The brick gets laid.
bad hombres....they are everywhere
why aren't Muslim refugees going to Saudi Arabia they can take 500,000  No takers they want to dominate us
President Trump is awesome!!! Finally we have a leader who cares about keeping the US safe!
I agree with you entirely.   I am 100% in what you are trying to achieve.
@dhotle Love the job you've doing! God bless you & may He keep you well & safe 24/7!
That's not what you did!  You think that little baby that needs heart surgery is a bad person with bad intentions?
There's no argument, 75% of America sez #FVCKtrump because among other things, ur #illegitimate, ur a #TwoBitTraitor 
Keep them out!  Take care of America first!
Exactly! Why do people want to complicate it?
can we keep you out of the country? You admitted to sexual assaults, you are a really bad hombre!
the word ban came from your mouth and your swamps mouth. On recorded. What exactly is your point here?
"Ponder and deliberate before make a move. " Sun Tzu, The Art of War
I BEGIN to LOVE CHINA more, there are many GREAT leaders while a CLOWN.
look within
Start with jihadi training camps here in US
@TrumpIsTheBoss3 Those of us in our right minds know that! We are with you, President Trump!
THEY'RE ALREADY HERE DUMMY. LOOK IN THE MIRROR!!
@jmanjerseyboy RIGHT !!
and helping to strengthen radical groups making it more likely for another 9/11. STUPID
Well put, Mr. President!!
but... it's a ban. And do yore homework, this will only create more terrorist problems not solve them. #learnhistorynow
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about maintaining prejudice and bigotry
If you want to keep bad people from harming Americans, limit the availability of guns & increase background checks. #resist
All the bad people come from the countries your hotels are in. Ban them!!!!!! ie: 9/11 terrorists
the silent majority around the world  worried about mass migration changing a nation's identity. Trump speaks for majority
What's Funny Trump Isn't the Problem ..U People R yr Own Enemy U make up Crap ..Get the Crap Right ." EXTREAM vetting period "
Ban Bannon!
"Everybody knows it's a ban. It is a ban, so there. My bad. It is about keeping my bad family in the White House!
its about keeping innocent people fleeing terror, who are a different religion than you, out of our country. Un-American!
@conraddalton39 this lady should be celebrated 
Sherri Kraham Talabani, President of SEED, found a refugee camp in #Kurdistan, helping 13000+ mostly #Yazidi #Kurds. 
so, it is a ban??
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
