How can we aid with the supply of potable water? @galmobiletm Mobile Desalination Vehicle produces clean water from any water source in 5min
The great USA to th rescue again.God bless our country and others as  well.
God bless those people and hopefully they will survive.
They aren't giving Puerto Rico enough. @FEMA what's the reason for the lack of supplies? @realDonaldTrump get your life together. #GolfLife
How about they get off of their asses & go get the supplies themselves? Start clearing the debris themselves?
Texans & Floridians did it,  Puerto Ricans can too.
PR is an island that sits in a hurricane path. They need to build infrastructure to handle it. They haven't done so.
They are NOT the same as FL & TX. They have citizenship ONLY because of the Spanish-American War. Assets were on the ground. Corrupt PR.

Proceeds from these sales go to @SavetheChildren for Puerto Rico. #Peace https://goo.gl/ygturS   #Love https://goo.gl/AVDg9B   #PuertoRico

.Looks like Donald Trump wants to send billions of dollars to #PuertoRico 
#speech @yahoonews @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump @USCG @RedCross @fema GO USCG!!
As a humanitarian crisis unfolds in Puerto Rico, journalists share what they are seeing on the ground

The crux of the issue is being overlooked by news:
Are you really replying with huffington post links?
I am the writer of the HuffPost article. You might be surprised if you read it.
Ur article appears fair & balanced, however, we also must ask ourselves why people weren't prepared w/food & water & gas at their homes
b4 the storm hit? I realize those r questions that may come after the crisis. But if that had occurred, drivers wld have been available. My
point is, this is NOT Trump's fault, my, fault, ur fault, etc..people MUST take personal responsibility 4 their lives, & b prepared!
Why are these "first responders" armed to the teeth?
A great reminder how God can make good from disaster. For that I am thankful. Let's show our support for our Territories above illegals.
CLICK ON THE BLUE "PUERTO RICO"...FOR GOOD INFO!!
@viking7314 
Thanks to everyone who is doing their part, and then some! The left probably thinks we're invading! Doing a great job guys!!!
THANK YOU!!
Thanks to our men & women that are serving. Thanks to your dedication & your families. We need your help & will always appreciate it.
I thank all the people helping and working so hard for PR. The problem we'd was that Trump response was 2 late. 2 weeks after hurricane late

Gracias
Beautiful!
@chefjoseandres Do you bother to read POTUS's tweets?  Or are you listening to your voice alone?  Check out his TL.
This is great but why only yesterday? 9 days ago would have been better. USCG knew a Cat5 hurricane was going right over #PuertoRico.
@pewdrdad @USCG @RedCross @fema Lazy locals sit on walls & watch? Screw them!
What world does Trump live in where it's acceptable to attack the mayor of San Juan while he plays golf with his billionaire friends?

Thank you for your service and God bless you all and God bless all who have suffered from Hurricane Maria. Sending prayers from Texas 
@realDonaldTrump the San Juan Mayor is holding the supplies and food from her own people she's a latin version of Hillary Clinton! Demonic!!
@realDonaldTrump they are killing their own people! While blaming you! What can U.S. do to see to it the people are helped??????!!!!!
Anyone common sense know SeaBees,NatGuard,ArmyCorpEng.must clear roadways for dispersal,ea. air drop supplies,takes pple back to safety!
thank you to the Coast Guard. Amazing men and women, unlike their political leadership.
You guys doing a incredible job. Thank you and God bless
We need to be realistic as well. An entire island was destroyed, will not be fixed in one day or one week. All help is there, but, it’s tuff
This is my brothers station!!!
Some CORRUPT THIEVES you can never please.
Keep close tabs on the money!
God Bless you guys  No Bitchin', Just gettin' the job done. ♡   USCG, USN, USA, USAF, USMC . Praying for the people of Puerto Rico

USCG, Please also post this on Facebook to get The word out, help is being provided to the citizens of Puerto Rico. Than you and bless you
This is heartwarming.
Too bad mayor Cruz didn't distribute the supplies to her constituents in need.
Since you didn't do it, someone had to. Wonderful embargo you had going there.
Good Job God bless you all
Thank you guys, all good harted Puertorricans appreciate what you are doing for our people. Don't get distracted by the few radical voices.
Stop with the fucking pointless hashtags.

MUST WATCH: #PuertoRican cop says " @CarmenYulinCruz isn't allowing anyone to distribute aid...its abuse, communism" https://youtu.be/5Uc1pPsKt_s 
Wonderfu!l Now we only have 3.49999999  million more people to help...
The haters will never give our President any credit no matter what he does

Thank you!
MSM spits in the faces of heroes! #EndDems #MAGA
God bless you, Coast Guard.  Thank you.
Thank you for your help....so needed so appreciated
Their work has been great.The people who should have expedited our response (especially our leaders) failed to perform, delaying rapid help!
Thanks for the hard work in the islands and fl
OUTSTANDING work by the US Coast Guard. Thank you Men & Women of the USCG for the Wonderful Relief Efforts for the people of Puerto Rico .
Where is Hollywood & all the millions of dollar's at to help. Where is all these liberal elite rich fat cats. Thats right silent whats new.
Well well well what do you know...
@RaidersReporter the help has been there for some time now & still pouring in.
God bless USCG,
Congrats to heroic USCG & thanks for your service! Let's not forget Delusional Donnie wants to cut the USCG by 1/3 to build a stupid wall!
Or that Delusional Donnie thinks you need a "rebranding!"
Ya think da rescue swimmers w/Trump logo branded wetsuits from China will be cute?
280.
GRACIAS to those on ground helping
to @GOP @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
NOTHING this #FakePresident has said is real

Lol. Yes. What a sensitive #broflake that requires his golf course safe space to tweet from while not doing any actual work. 
Hahaha! The left just can't stand it when they're wrong.  Which happens a lot.
Thank you for helping the people!
Well I guess the people don't have to be scared anymore since the Democrats aren't in power. Democrats, flush 50 times, then use the plunger

Very disturbing that DOJ and Sessions are not taking any action in the IRS scandal. Message to all bureaucrats: Do your worst. #loislerner
Thank you
Question? Why hadn't military and non profits by bringing.
Now go help the 80% left in need wether there's red tape or not. You represent the US people not the traitorous POTUS.
I love Puerto Rico.
Small parts of country inaccessible many can't get the aid.They need help to distribute supplies.What don't you understand? People are dying
@CNN here is some help reporting REAL news
Our Coast Guard is awesome!!
Don’t look like anyone dying of starvation!
This is no pick nick, this is stuff for everyone on the Island!!!
Donate to the Coastguard foundation!
Never as fast as one would wish, but it’s going to be a long long road to recovery.. Things are, getting done.
LOL
Trump haters are disgusting humans !
9 days too damn late and trying to get credit or you feel guilty. Wow are you sensitive, but why?? Sad
10 Days Late!
Praying for the people.
Wow gano el Leon 3x0 a lobos
#25thAmendmentNow
Doesn't matter. #TrumpsKatrina
If it was tweeted by Donald Trump it is definitely a lie
Ok, but we must do more, please!
And this is the reason that relief is stuck at the port....
You mean the hurricane that made landfall 10 days ago?
I think the hurricane was 2 weeks ago but isn't it great we are doing something now.  Better late than never!  I'll show that mayor lady!

It's about time it's been over 10 days

@amelia_karras
Trump says victims want free stuff.
Roads are not passable, bridges down, trees down, no cell towers, no truck drivers (no CDLs in PR?), no gas....why is it taking longer???
stop let AG &DOJ PROTECTING OF DOCUMENTS THAT WILL TAKE OBAMA AND HILLARY DOWN. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABOVE THE LAW THIS IS B.S.
You're late. #FakePresident
@zaria_hart1 @USCG @RedCross @fema Bravo Zulu to all.
We will be with you as PR is rebuilt! Bigger, better and stronger than ever! President Trump does NOT fail!
You are to lead otherwise, nothing will be accomplished.  Gnral. Buchanan with the military corps will
Difficult it's an island  cant just drive over  Takes more planning  How many have died in Puerto Rico?  Looks like many elderly
Americans are so good. Thee most generous nation on earth 
The truth
