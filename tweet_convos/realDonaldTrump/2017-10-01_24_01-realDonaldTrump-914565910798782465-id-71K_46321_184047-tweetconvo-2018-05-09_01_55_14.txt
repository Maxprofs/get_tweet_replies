He is winning at failure. He might be proud of that.
Oh I know he thinks he is the most successful president and person ever. He is so delusional.
I think that's the narcissism. Ego so fragile it can't bear shame, so bends view of reality itself if necessary to avoid feeling it.
I agree. And he attacks anyone who disagrees with him or says the truth about him, which is obviously never flattering. What a pathetic
President Dotard isn’t going to let a little something like logic or reason stop him!

N Korea has advanced more weapon systems, fired more missiles further, and detonated more kilotons under FAKE @POTUS than ANY US President
#winning

Trump, if you really love America like you say you do, you'd do us a favor and resign. Being the #potus is for adults, not children
Like they tell me, tell us how you really feel!     
Amen sister! Can u believe he dedicated the presidents cup trophy to the hurricane victims. OMGOSH! I’ve had it! Dropping f bombs everywhere
Welcome to my world!! I've been f-bombing since Nov 8th!! Will be "nice" again when he's out of office & in prison! Until then, I'm like:
Oct 19th I was posting this when i had a Facebook account, as a passive aggressive response to people actually considering voting for him
That’s kinda creepy!
To me, anyone that voted for him were
Racist 
Sexist
Misogynists 
Completely ignorant or
Cutting off their noses to spite their faces
Yes, they all failed to start a nuclear war. Looks like you'll probably succeed. GIVE THAT MAN A TOFFEE APPLE!
Also omits to mention that 25 years ago KJU was 8 years old.
Why would facts ever matter to DJT?
NK's foreign minister stated that your tweets amounted to a declaration of war. YOUR TWEETS! That's as bigly as anyone could possibly fail.
@GOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @StateDept @DHSgov ARE YOU SEEING THIS FOLKS. DANGER TO SELF & OTHERS  IMPEACH

This tweetstorm is triggered by what? News reports of Tillerson's comments in Beijing? What was on Fox when he started them?
What is intention? Get people not talking so much about PR? Show base he's still tough guy on NK? Undermine the basis of diplomacy on NK?
He is an idiot, needing to use 1 failure to distract from another, all the time. He must be removed. Nobody with any brains here wants war.
No one does want war. But Kim isn’t a leader you can negotiate with, he’s the type of leader you send our troops to murder. Like Hitler.
It is not remotely that simple. Trump is destabilizing when we should be deterring. Read:
Where's the option for "Stop calling him Rocket Man and act like a fucking grown up?"
Oh come on we can have fun too
Yeah, what's more fun than tempting nuclear holocaust!?
You guys look for anything to attack Trump and his followers. Truly remarkable behavior.
 You think we have to look! The only way you could see anything wrong is if you wandered round with your eyes closed.
Yes you do have to look. It’s pretty obvious.
Paying attention is not the same as looking. But your on the side with "the best words" so you should know that.
At what cost several million South Korean and Japanese civilians. You got China to put pressure on them. No one else has. Patience POTUS.
Not to mention the North Korean civilians, who don't seem to have much in the way of choice.
Those are real #Presidents.... So as a #FakePresident you can't fail... 
Look it's Mitch McConnell  !
I think presidents who are treasonous can be executed. I don't like death penalty.  I'd make an exception for you though.
Lmao
You're wrong! They all succeeded in preventing a nuclear war  Clearly you hv no clue how to handle international relations or domestic ones
He is a pathetical liar

Amen God Help Us  We Need It

Absolutely.

The bottom right one has an important message that everyone needs to read. Should be put up by itself. 
 Done. 
Thanks!
Any time! 
25 years? Kim Jong-un has only been in power since 2012, moron.
He think all us Kims look exactly alike. No worries about impending nuclear holocaust. We all just look the same.
That was his dad you buffoon, how the fuck can you not know that?
He doesn't seem to know much aside from an ocean surrounds Puerto Rico
Bigly water. Very wet water. The wettest water you've ever seen. Water stretching millions of miles!! PR hit by biggest water tornado, ever!
Thank God you will die someday, somehow, you little piece of crap.
Ah yes because wanting somebody to literally die is so peaceful right? Oh yeah since were under your control why don't we let NK come here?
YOU ARE INSANE

You failed at Steaks,University,Casinos,TrumpCare,Vodka,Airline,Trump Towers Tampa,USFL,Magazine,Water,Mortgage co,Media co,
(2)failed at  http://GoTrump.Com ,Trump Network,Tour de Trump,Jones Beach Eatery,Trumpnet,Marriages, and the list can go on forever
I think you should have my 280 characters. You'll make much better use of them. I'll just use them to ponder how ice cream can possibly make me gain weight. Who knew?!
Just think of how many people I could offend with double the characters.
Wow. That's the only thing I like about it.
Imagine how much everyone will offend when everyone has it.
Usually it takes me about 10 tweets to lose 100 followers...but I could lose 100 followers with just 5 tweets...that shit would be effective
Seriously, I don't know how you can stand to have so many followers. I'd be so uncomfortable with that kind of attention. I don't even like my 50 porn bots reading my dumb tweets.
When they feel bad about themselves, they read my tweets & realize @ least they have more grace&dignity than I do.I'm a self-esteem booster.

Why not?  You've failed (and I mean *completely bombed*) at everything else.
Bad idea to talk to him about bombing
get ahead of the game! #ResignNow and you #Win  
And don't forget, Failed at winning the election without Russia's help.
You and a lot of other people please don't make that mistake again Trump for the street in 2020
Remember when you signed that bill allowing mentally ill to buy guns? Las Vegas is blood on your hands! Just like Puerto Rico! RESIGN NOW!!!
You have already failed ,except you are too stupid to know it.
HE HASN'T BEEN IN CHARGE FOR 25 YEARS YOU #Dotard

The embodiment of narcissism
He spoke a good game to the right people.  Fired up the people who the American dream failed.  Sadly his promises were all lies
Get Economy roaring by freeing $fnma igniting housing access and affordability & taxes then you could corner China and Rocketman #rocketplan
You are a failure. Not only are you a failure but you are a global joke. The world laughs at you. You're nothing. RESIGN.
On Day 11, this tweet really didn't age well.
...Kim Jong-Un has only been "supreme leader" for 5 years. You're talking about Kim Jong-Il, you history-less hexagon.
I love how you are calling people hexagons.
Trying to stick to nonvulgar insults. Hexagon. Egghead. Crusty muffin. Oxygen thief. Wet flip flop.
You already have failed. Your tweet right there shows that you failed. You are failure, personified.
#Resign
What is the tweet above? Can't scroll up.
Bah nor can I.
Grrr...
Here's what it said:

https://twitter.com/LokiLoptr/status/914621440875515904 …
That's double weird. I meant what trump said. But I can't scroll up past my tweet now... Hmm... Maybe Twitter did something to me?
Cue the Sunny in Philadelphia theme:
A nuclear conflict would be the single greatest failure humanity has ever known.

Worked out reasonably well for Elton John 
I still want to believe in you my entire family stopped talking to me because I voted for you I do not want to look like an ass
too late

You know it's not the same guy, right?  Of course you don't.
@3_wd_sg @Limpbutt @DeepStateFan @BeansPorkn @__CashMeOusside Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that Rocket Man has only been in power for six years rather than 25 years?
This is what you get when you combine his North Korea tweet up there with the tax bill.
How would you like it if he called you "Tiny Hands"? Stop being rude!  You really need a social media rep!
Kim Jong-un hasn't been in office that long, idiot.

I say that every time the fat bastard is on TV
Trump is my President
And the world is sorry for you
You wish
In Trump We Trust!
I love OUR President!! #MAGA

That's why I voted for you I didn't think you wanted to fail but now you got me so confused
Why do you have to call people names? Act like someone with sense & for the Love of God...STOP TWEETING dammit!!
Stop calling him Rocket Man. Stop embarrassing your country on Twitter. Isn't there a job you should be doing on my tax dollar?? Smh
Yes Sir you will fail to the highest degree. Why When the nukes hit the USA, you'll
B the cause of billions of deaths across the USA.
Not to mention that Clinton and Bush did not deal with "little rocket man". But that's fake news right?
LOL yes it is! I mean seriously "The Rocket Man" is Sir Elton John. Mr @DT is old enough to know that! Don Trump is Not a real President!
TRUMP Will go down in history. Yup, the president who caused nuclear war, mass #genocide of #chronicpain patients, kicking Americans while 1
They are down. Bringing back some of the worst times in history, grabbing genitals, causing hate crimes, & Making America Prejudice Again.
KIM JONG-UN In power since 2011, DUMKOFF
#RocketMan was only 8 yrs old 25 yrs ago. He's only been #SupremeLeader since 2011. #Dotard #25thAmendmentNow
The experience of loving is very much a direct response 2 the experience of BEING loved. People can B like God if U treat them as God would!
Thank you Mr. President. Your a true Commander in Chief just like Reagan was!
Just like this gentleman
He was 8 yrs old 25yrs ago. Wow. I feel like I'm living in an alt universe.
Actually, Clinton had a nuclear disarmament deal in place but Bush scrapped it. Arn't you supposedly the #FakeNews vigilante?
Liar. #Impeach
We weren't nuked during any of their presidencies so I would say that they were successful. Please don't ruin that streak.
At this point I'd be happy if you could manage a single day without failing. Such a disappointment. You lie to us daily.
Why on earth would we believe you?! Your track record is one of failure..!

#ImpeachTrump
He's 33. 25 years ago he would have been 8...
In a unprecedented move by Rocket Man to be more dictator like.
Top late, Donny. You're already a failure.
I believe we should strike hard fast and out of nowhere and take out the regime and military.
This in itself can explain why Crooked Hillary LOST! We're sick of being duped by weak, ineffective & even treasonous so-called leaders!
President Trump , we believe in a Strong America , your doing a terrific job sir !
US needs to watch President Moon who is nice to Rocket man. NK re-opened shut-down factories in Gaesung,NK. I suspect Moon sent electricity.
@realDonaldTrump 25 years eh??? So he was under cover for 19 years. Don, my man, you're a genius...

Heres me being postive for today: you'll fail too Trump
Umm- you just failed at History & math w that statement...as always. #disappointed. Do NOT cause a nuclear war! Lead- don't divide.
25 years ago, Kim Jong Un was 8. Just FYI
He's referring to all of these ridiculous midget Kim family dictators that oppress their captive people & extort us of our taxpayers' money.
I’m aware genius
Okay. I hope I wasn't being condescending. Have a great week.
I hope not.
OMG!  Like ANYBODY believes you?  You have lied since the day you learned to talk!
I agree with President Trump -- he will not fail!
@Twitter @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety @jack how does this not violate any rules on here? Seriously. Literally inciting WW3
Maybe it's scale- like buying in bulk @Twitter?. Or that Kim Jong-un was 8 25yrs ago - about Trump's maturity level - so a factual discount?
"Rocket man" hasn't been alive for 25 years, he was six twenty five years ago. Dotard.
Kim Jong-un ("Rocket Man) has only been in power since 2014, how the %#*^ are you president??
Yawn.
You are a scary man. And just to be clear, that is NOT a good thing.
Between them both, they have about seven years political experience each LOL
Rocket Man would have been 8 years old 25 years ago and you had just bought Marla Maples
Smartest thing you've ever said!
God bless Trump - keep #winningatlife
yeah you’ll just get us all fucking killed instead 
Just stop !
If I'm not wrong Kim Jong Un was a kid 25 years ago.
Stop #nigeriagovernment from mass genocide in @BIAFRALAND
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Oh please 
Lol!!  You ARE failing!
Forget rocketman how adout.seniors we need a increase in S,S.
Boy oh boy, someone is confused
Just starting another world war right
Too late fatso. You’ve already failed, and miserably at that. America is a laughing stock around the world thanks to you, trump.
When was America great??
#Trump #Northkorea
I previously compared you to General Ripper, but now realize it’s all an act. You’re more like the bumbling authoritarian, Col. “Bat” Guano
The Don doesnt know how to fail.
.  We love you and support you, President  Trump.
Gonna get this Country destroyed. The former Presidents are shocked at your cocky behavior.
Your failure is a matter of global record.
In war, no one wins or loses. There is only destruction.

May G-D bless you and give you the strength to make America Great again
You fail at everything. Your approach is irresponsible.  Nobody with good sense expects you to achieve positive results.
How idiotic can you be?  Clinton,  Bush, and Obama didn't have us within one short temper tantrum or Twitter battle leading to nuclear war and mass casualties....  YOU DO!! 
How is that possible? He has only been in power for 6 years. 
of course u will
This clown. He is like a little child 
You have so far.
You win at failing!!!!
Why not? You are failing at everything else.
Hanlon’s razor: “never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”
It's about time Americans and their allies supported the president.  Funny how everyone thinks they know better!
Trump thinks he's god,, and we should all bow down for him
FAIL!!!!!!!
I will be thinking of you President  Trump on your trip to Asia and supporting your efforts on behalf of the American people. Safe return.
Thank you for maturely taunting the person that has a nuke pointed towards us. Means alot.
Ok do what u wanna do just don't nuke anyone...
I hate to be the one to break it to you, but your Presidency is a complete and utter failure to date. Nicknames...pathetic.
I doubt trumps sanity
Avoiding a war is not failure. Human lives are worth more than any amount of $
I may be wrong, but I don’t think he was in power 25 years ago. You know, because his father was. #MathIsHard #DumbTrump
Bet u will
Introduce rocketman to j-dam diddy mac
Pride is the most dangerous thing not rocket man
i agree with you that North Korea's always been a problem one that's needed to be dealt with for ages now but not with a nuclear exchange 
Just try not to get us killed, okay?  Does anyone read our comments?
I don't want you
Just updating here! AND HE KEPT HIS PROMISE!!! y’all haters can sit down and eat it. Just take it all in! Yeah!!!
prove it
I agree Mr. President. We’re going to stand around and talk about what Rocket Nan can do and the next thing we know there’s a bomb in the US
It's like when ppl kiss up to U. U respond almost like human being when it's All about U. Same for Kim Jung-Un. It's all about saving face.
You are a failure not just as a president but as a member of the human race. You have already failed.

You realize they have a new guy in charge now right?


It's what happens when you DON'T "lead from behind"
Lets hope, long way to go. They can’t be trusted.
Yes only been in office 5 and a half years.

U hve ready lost aready many Tests on your watch u r the weak one 
You already failed. In fact, you've been a failure your whole life. Your daddy would agree. #Failure #MoronDon #BankruptcyKing
You have failed miserably!
From Mylene Perlada admin of the only international Trump site in the Philippines...
Didn't realize Kim Jong Un had been in power that long. #alternativefacts
Mission Complete...
This aged well.
Yeah, because Kim Jong-Un was a major threat to our country at age eight
Just drop 100 nukes at the same time on N-Korea, it needs to be destroyed
I dont think so .you will
#assholeinchief
Just like fine wine. This tweet matured to show a true Winner. We are blessed to have you, Sir....#RealeaseTheTexts

Test of time and time would  tell ,how it's going to be deliver. Hope negotiations is the best deal so far because sanctions isn't working
if you get us into another illegal war, does that mean we can arrest you for treason and watch your ass swing?
It's like trying to start a conversation with your rapist. #wasteoftime #killhim
Great
hey hey
Against Opposed - on #SoundCloud #np
if you snuck USA marked  food aid 2 starving masses in NoKo, u could start revolution 2 depose Kim. Kill him w kindness. Think outside box
Dear Mr. President ;

You are cordially requested to show Korean people that AMERICA is back by ignoring Moon Jaein (communist) and bombing the rocketman Kim in north Korea.

You will get a big hand from most Korean people crying for liberal democracy and cleaning of communists.
