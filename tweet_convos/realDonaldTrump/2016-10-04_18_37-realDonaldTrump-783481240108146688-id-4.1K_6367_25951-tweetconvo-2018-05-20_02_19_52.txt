wow, Kaine is just spewing talking points. I wonder how long he practiced?
does that mean he'll tutor you for the next one?
he is a cool cat!
nice try Donald
This moderator is helping Tim Kaine...and the questions are turning on Pense.....
lol! In your dreams little man! #NeverTrump
He also performed well in the "not telling the truth" department...
yes he has
Trump should learn something but he won't.
Kaine is down right childish. just full of insults, and interruptions. Pence is so prepared. #Trump2016 #VPDebate
he does sound good..but this moderator keeps losing control
unlike Trump last week#
I wish Tim Kaine would let Mike speak.  How rude.

Kaine a rude loud junkie!
maybe you should try it sometime. Read a book.
@mike_pence is cool calm and collected. @timkaine is getting upset he's losing.
that's why Kaine is consonantly interrupting
I feel so bad for Pence. A perfectly reasonable Republican forced to try and defend you! A shame!
in the end there had to be evil there since he stands behind trump.
Donald Fuck-Duck. Wake up Trump supporters, is this your  "Monster" that will make America great?
@realDplease note how presidential he is....YOU need to be like this. !#onaldTrump @GeeVeeM @realDonaldTrump @Susiesentinel
Very likable. 
Clear who I'd like to have a beer with. 

Kaine uses that "Projection" thing again.
this debate is one sided, Kaine interrupts pence every few seconds, moderator does not stop him..
Please do your homework, Donald Trump.  You need to take a lesson from your own words.
.@realDonaldTrump You should be more embarrassed that a 4th grade debate student would have outperformed you vs Hillary last week. #VPDebate
Great decision on choosing Pence. Proves you have great judgment. Hillary is bad judgment!
Pence greatest asset is he's teachable.
but u weren't last week
I find it totally bizarre that a presidental candidate is Tweeting during the VP debate.  #insane
Kaine apparently came prepared to throw insult after insult - so OLD & irrelevant to voters. MAGA
it's a real shame @realDonaldTrump didn't do the same...
too bad you didn't follow suit
@nnwehby_ahmad @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel 
Pence was OUTSTANDING! Kaine reminded me of Jack Nicholson & his CRAZY LOOK
Kaine is rude!  Typical liberal!
also that Kaine looks like a moron when he interrupts and insults Pence.
learn from it.
not sure what debate you're watching. #ClintonKaine2016
yes. Next time please do yours
Kaine reminds me of a GIRLY MAN

I guess he showed his boss how to get shit done for debates! @HillaryClinton
I hope you are doing your homework Be like Pence u will win
Take a lesson .
when will it start, so far Kaine is eating him alive
he called the College Norwood.It's Longwood.He was an idiot out of the gate. Way to go @mike_pence
your boy is doing good. Kaine is a train wreck. Demeanor temperament and Look
Is this what it looks like when you hang with your friends? #VPDebate
Pence doesn't have to prepare to beat Kaine every time!

He watched your pathetic debate attempt and maybe wanted to not fail as bad? Too bad. Still did.
doesn't take much homework to make up 70% lies. No fact checking whatsoever.
#POOR_Donald unlike you
What did you learn
Cool, calm, collected. I think he gave Kaine a little break. LOL
He's not soap opera star. Bless his heart!
Hilary failed at everything
not evry where
PS. Your candidate's name is, "Kaine"... Just in case you want to look him up.
Right on! First step to freedom is getting off the Democrat plantation!  welcome!
Unlike you
he's l
what are you watching?
Bench Pence Donny Donny Donny
Stupid Pence has just been holding a fart the entire night @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel
oh please
Unfortunately not true !!!
too bad u never do urs!
obvious Kaine can't think rationally. Keeps repeating his nonsense
Then learn from him! Don't lie and release your tax return
Ummm. Then... Why isn't he doing better?  ( He's a great question dodger, though.)
OK this wins as the most ironic tweet ever, coming from the #HatePumpkin
Kaine has memorized every MSM cliche about Trump! He's terrible!
Let's go Gov Pence - fight back - stop letting him interrupt !!
I can't wait until next week when you go head to head w Hillary again. I'll get another laugh fool
Pence is just carrying your coat and polishing your shoes!
Excellent Job
What debate are you watching?
Hillary helped killed Bin Laden!? Her husband had him in the cross hairs & didn't act pre 9/11!!
Unlike you @realDonaldTrump @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel
your guy is not doing well right now
You are insane!
Kaine has no substance, just babbling rehashed talking points, interrupts with false narratives !
Unlike you did
Moderator let's Kaine interrupt all the time but doesn't let Pence.
KAINE looks like a child molester
don't get personal or take the attacks personally but pinch up w facts & truths HRC cant tell nor h able the TRUTH
If you did the same, you could kick Hillary's ass.. you have a lot of ammunition, man! USE IT!
pence is killing it!
unlike you! Bad
Yep, he's a smoother liar than you are, but same lies.
#Delusionaldonald
Pence is showing professionalism so unlike Kaine continually speaking over & interrupting Pence.
hmm I don't see it that way. He appears flustered
@anthony5505USNVQ-1
he may have studied but your pick is failing on the exam.
UNLIKE yourself Mr. Duck! He's obnoxious like YOU!
But Pence is winning big time!  Kaine & Hillary can't win without cheating!!
# you don't prepare
#NeverHillary #WakeUpAmerica #ClintonScandals #ClintonFoundation
lying apprentice lol...  Pence is 1000x better than you.  Lol
lol you mean sitting there with his eyebrows smashed together shaking his head with a creepy chuckle? Denying everything? 
we will all be winners soon #VoteTrumpPence
Yea unlike you Ha!
snap!
Kaine is interrupting sooo much. Pence reprimanded for small interruption. I can see the bias.
Not at all. He's sinking like a bag of rocks
something you failed big time, that's OK you are used to losing and claiming you won.
unlike you, right? I hate that you're so old! I usually respect my elders but you...not a chance!
now you be prepared for your next debate. Our future as strong nation depends on you defeating #CrookedHillary
Smilng, unlike the top of his ticket who does not have the mental,capacity to prepare?
Yes he did!
Why is the mediator scolding Mike Pence for interrupting but allowing Kaine to do it every time? Why?
this debate is so biased against the trump campaign @timkaine wont let @MikePenceVP get one word in
its not basis.. mike pence has said plenty.  None of which is any good.
over and over has @timkaine cut off mike pence he is low class and is showing it
so then trump was low class, right?  Trump
he said a few words to make a point kaine disrespectfully talked over mike pence
like trump did hillary is that what u mean?
kaine blatantly talked over while trump made a few comments.
@pence we will enforce the law!
why didn't you do yours! You got 1 more chance...
Its amazing how prepared Kaine is also...Go Kaine
Tim Kaine is a joke . Just because you speak louder and faster doesn't mean you're right or winning!
I suppose the dog ate your homework.
so kaine is allowed to interrupt pence but not the other way around
Pence destroying Crooked Evil Cain, all insults no substance
Um..No. Your boy is getting eviscerated creamed & slammed. @realDonaldTrump @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel
learned a lesson from Donald's bad performance after no prep!
Pence left his homework home!
you would think so he is acting like you #DumpTrump
Trump.....build that wall.
Kaine just got owned!!!!!
hillary said I was deplorable...
HE'S HIRED !

@UghToHillary @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel He was awesome,.
the winner of this debate is mike pence stop interrupting mcklaine Godbless
Take notes! You have to do better in next debate or Hillary wins!

Awesome. How about YOU do that next time as well? ;-)
#kainemeltdown
does pence do your homework @realDonaldTrump?
Yes he is ... now Trump do your homework and come out for Debate #2 like this!!
In your dreams! he's losing his shirt!!
Kaine discusses policy pence just drones on
it didn't take much, Kaine is like a child!
Kaine continually & rudely interupts @mike_pence Pence every time Sen. Pence answers a question
Yes! And did you see Kaine's hand shaking when he got a drink!
more then you did and you are the nominee what didn't you study to busy  tweeting about fat women
glad someone does their homework and prepares for debates.
God bless Trump and the wise Pence! And America!!!!
Kaine is a whiny little twerp. #KaineVsPence
@wittier @realDonaldTrump @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel  So is @HillaryClinton
unlike you and your unpreparedness
And now Mr. Trump you must PREPARE!
@timkaine He is rude and obnoxious. @GovPenceIN level headed and absolutely correct.
KAINE IS BULLYING PENCE AND WILL BE COSIDERED THE DEBATE WINNER
You have to find that black guy that was on Rush a few days ago. He'd make Kaine's head spin.
Yeah. Too bad he's not at the top of the ticket. #chickendonald
And he lied a lot Trump Style. Get ready for Sunday and leave the lies at home, Fact Checker.
Kaine is looking shaky
Pence is a true winner and gentleman!
Mr.  Trump, we love you, but please, you could learn from the way Pence is acting...awesome.
Kaine is just as much of a joke as Hillary.
A true leader works hard, puts his heart into the task. I see that in you & Mike!

Kaine- oh now we're even. Like a school yard kid. Tag your it. Grow up!
So, Mr Trump - - - TAKE NOTES!
