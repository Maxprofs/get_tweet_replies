@realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPol @POTUS Brietbart is a white supremacists fake news outlet. You are just like them. White-supreme and fake!
Um, is that your tattoo on your white skin? Who in hell made you think it's okay to feel white shamed?
what makes you think I feel white shamed? I'm just happy to be human. My tat is from Lion King
why do you want to argue with me? It seems the only ones who can't see white privilege are white men
White privilege is a label made up by liberals to control by shame. Period.
white privilege is real. I have it. Hide your head if you want. Bet you don't get stereotyped because of what other whites do
Wow. That is utter nonsense. I pray you find your sense of self-worth and appreciation for being human without remorse.
have you ever been denied a place to live because the color ov your skin? Ask POTUS about that one...
Woah You believe Breitbart supports @realDonaldTrump and thinks he has accomplishments? Color me shocked Bless your heart
You think Trump is going down over Russia?  If so, you'll believe anything.
I do and the beer of your choice bet still stands New topic @realDonaldTrump should pay the security costs for his wife 2 live away from him
No.
Interesting it only took you 20 minutes to come up with a 2 letter response Will you tweet your outrage to @realDonaldTrump ? I doubt it
I am a Republican, so I have a job.
Still living with the parents?
You are simple & simply a horrible person, like all the way to your core Bless you & yours I hope you find forgiveness
You support abortionists... ...so you really should get off mount high.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
Remember he was going to use American steel to build pipelines? Russian steel arrived last week.
- then keep Wilbur Ross' old job in mind and go look at what bank they run their money through. #sickening
@fritchee @Anastaisastweet Now find the Cornell U report on pipeline, who owns the pipes and look at 2nd biggest shareholder.

YEP. But nothing going on, right?
Mind-blowing. Do U think Congress knows & hopes public doesn't catch-on bc they(Congress)R getting paid-off?
That's an awesome question. This is all creepy. I am afraid to think what they'll do to distract us. WWIII?
