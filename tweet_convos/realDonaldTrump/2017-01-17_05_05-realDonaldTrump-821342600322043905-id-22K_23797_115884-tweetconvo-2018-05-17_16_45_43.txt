Inciting a riot is a chargeable offense you know, dotard.
Please undo the NDAA.
Except it's not 'bikers for trump'.

Dear fat greasy Chito,  can you hear the bells ringing
Obama's 2008 inauguration was AMAZING. Yours not so much. You were SO obsessed with the size of the crowd when you should have been investigating the CYBER ATTACK PARAMOUNT TO AN ACT OF WAR. #QuidProQuo #TrumpPutin
It's over.

#MyTweetWontMakeItIntoPropagandaFile
You are constructing the perfect melting pot for extreme violence at a historically peaceful ceremony.
This is your plan, of course. Create the right conditions for you to call in the Guard as a show of force.
TRUMPCARE as promised will be much better for working Americans than Obamacare. Waiting for plan!
Record LOW numbers!
Just wait until the WOMENS MARCH happens on Saturday! Their numbers will KILL your numbers-  and what does THAT SAY?
define great.
Record numbers?  So, like, 33 1/3?
900,00 Protestors should be interesting. Enjoy!!
I will be watching in Dornoch Scotland good luck Mr president let's get this show on the road !
yeah, bring in the "Hells Angels" what can go wrong? #rememberAltamont
*record (low) numbers...
Yeah, like most of those people are PROTESTING you, dude.  #WomensMarch
private security gangs ? Bikers for trump ? Will they have guns ?
haha you're in for a surprise then when you're outnumbered by protestors
Trump is the American peoples hero.  Go Trump!
No One Cares What You Think or Say.  You lie 90% of the time, so no one can trust you. Fake. Liar. Creep.
Can't wait for Saturday! Women's March will be great!
Please stop looking for attention.....
they are there to protest. foolish
Yes, record low numbers
Please spare no expense in Security. This Country will loose it's Sovereignty and Identity WITHOUT YOU. Salute 
#MAGA

SURE THEY ARE DONNY TINY FINGERS SURE THEY ARE.
they're protestors
that's funny..Thnks so much
it's so sad....you're just like Peter Brady when nobody wanted to come to his party. Sorry, Donny, gotta wash my hair 
I live here.
Trust me, they're not. In fact the city has actually seemed quiet so far this week.
you have the backing of the people thats the real DJT 
THANK YOU. We must keep our President safe! MLK and JFK had a vision for this country, so do you. God bless!
Martin Luther King jr. Didn't run four businesses into the ground
And by pouring you mean trickling in. Or a steady shower?
maybe a golden shower. Who knows? 
they are pouring in to march against you. 200 busses for you! 1200 for the woman's march against you! #Trumplethinskin
you do one of 2 things when you open your mouth. You either lie or exaggerate.
. I have never been so embarrassed of people who call themselves Americans. We did not throw "tantrums" when Obama elected.
.@realDonaldTrump Throw in some funnel cakes and this will be the most amazing state fair ever!!!
Will there be pie?
I'm leaving in the morning!

Hoping your inaugural is crashed big time.
your a counselor? ?? Grow Up,
Security is crucial. We must keep President Trump safe this inauguration!
#DemocratsForTrump

.@realDonaldTrump You know this is happening on Saturday, right?
That's because they are protesting, Donny, against the illegitimate POTUS45. #NotMyPresident
hide where?
*border
U can't treat the AmericanPeople like shit,& not Expect them 2 RISE UP
#DumpTrumpism 
Reminder"We the people"DIDN'T elect his KIDS 2 run OUR country.

Actually"We the people"by a majority DIDN'T elect @realDonaldTrump either.
Fox News' Charles Krauthammer is REALLY FED UP with Trump #TheResistance #msnbc #CNN
@Nan303030 With the arrival of Bikers for Trump, DC has seen a huge influx of Hookers for Trump and Meth Dealers for Trump
Was your Mom with them?  #CloserNation #maga @stranahan #BikersForTrump @thebestcloser
Really? A 'Mom' insult? Looks like you've had a few too many Nan
You're the one who insulted my friends!
Defend against what?! 200,000 women march? Ppl holding signs? We have police
The bikers are protesting the protesters.Good for the goose
Do you really believe that your pee-wee band of trump grunts will out number the protesters sweetie? aww thats cute







HI Mr.Trump God Bless you and God Bless America.
First big bands, then cover bands and now even holograms of bands won't play at your inauguration.
omg! No JEM?!? Def. Not going now.
you were historical!! Thank you for being You !!!!!
Well , at least you drained the swamp... maybe thats why no one came to your inauguration!

Aside from all those lobbyists
We love you President Elect Trump!  Looking forward to Friday.  Congratulations.
how many of those pouring in to DC are protesters?
no they are not#sadloser
Not really, please ssshhhh!
A total blackout of all inauguration activities will be enforced on my TV, PC, radio, and cell phone.
The people coming on Saturday are not your sycophants -- They are protesting your Presidency or didn't u get that briefing?
Hurray for Chris Cox & his fellow bikers-for-Trump! Best to supplement their manly wall of meat with water cannons in case!
.@realDonaldTrump you do realize that that they won't be there to SUPPORT you, but to PROTEST you?  Nice try spinning the numbers yet again.
ya just can't stop your HUGGGE lies! SMH
laugh my ass off you have the lowest turnout of any inauguration ha ha #putinSUb
thank God for Democrat boycott more room for good http://ppl.Now  if protesters would boycott  too.
You really shouldn't count the 100,000k+ who are protesting you. Just saying...
those are called protest, tiny trump.
CONGRATULATIONS PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!
saw them, It very touching

where's the fire dept... #donthecon's pants are onfire
Your breath stinks so bad that it destroyed half the ozone layer.
We heard that you were afraid to go there bc of the demonstrations - many, many people who do not love you.
dream on Dumpster. 370 marches to protest YOU....All over the world.
dear brother my prayers with you all time you must change American problem God give you big chance my blessings with you
Oh yes Donald, just to  demonstrate against your  presidency.
Do you mean the "Wall of Rotten Hamburger"
I know you like Rolling Stones music for events, but Rolling Stones-style security too? Altamont anyone? It'll be bloody.
Yeah, my only hope is that most of them are law enforcement, because u sir are TOXIC! YOU DIGUST ME!
Ian so proud to be an American with Donald Trump as our new president thank you God for making this happen.
Glad the bikers will be there.
- just really excited for Friday to get here!!!  We so need a change!!!  Congratulations!!
Biker's for Trump.Let them snowflake's fuck with them.Bahahaha.
fake news
u r not mentioning the protesters. Biased trump!!
the protesters are pouring
May a plague of flat tires rain down upon them.
Yea people are pouring in to protest you. More people showed up against you than for you.
The record is for protesters! It will be a bad day for the US and the World.  King Trump the Weak Minded
this was such a refreshing moment in time. Very authentic looking. Liked that the songs spoke of God for a change!
who poured in?! This shit was wack. You can't compare to @POTUS44 @BarackObama you ain't got it and don't nobody care...
I'll be in my classroom in final year teaching, but with you in spirit and much prayer too. Will campaign again. Blessings!
Aww you have your very own Night Wolves.
Really sad!
Monday is going to be the good day, When they file impeachment hearings.
it's going to be a great 8 years! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
not for the reasons you are hoping for... #WomensMarchOnWashington #marchonladies
Go bikers yeah
Scalpers can't sell your tickets lol
God has answered the prayers of the multitudes seeking the Light and The Truth, especially on a great day if hope for us!
.@realDonaldTrump 
200 bus permit applications for your inauguration.  2,000 bus permit applications for #WomensMarch .
@mflynnJR fake
could we get a retweet? We almost here!
Yes it will!  I'm so thankful to God for placing you here for us!
the Mall was "less than full", believe me, it was terrifically less than full.
Amazing how many hotel rooms are available in the D.C.during the inauguration, really cheap $350. Not like 4yrs ago when there were no rooms
I will be watching your historic day with pride that you are our 45th, President Mr. Trump.
You're excited, & with good reason. U won!
Actually, more people showed up for Obama. Let's start being honest for once.
The wall of meatheads must have stopped at a pub....They were nowhere in sight
it will be a great day for all. We celebrate it by having a few people over. Just got the cake and bubbly.
lol. Those biker photos & video were taken in the summertime. Try again.
You are the greatest accident mother nature has ever encountered
on their way in can they detour by my place and run me over so i dont have to live through your presidency?
You realize you have to work (as POTUS) on Sunday.  Start watching The West Wing. Maybe it will help (probably not). Sad.
this must be sooooo embarrassing for you. I've never seen a worse looking inauguration with so few people
#Amen
Turns out they were pouring in in record numbers for the #WomensMarchOnWashington Biggest inauguration protest in history.
would love to be a part.... what is available for my husband and I?
bikers 4 trump huh?  Red flag in my life....do u know why??? 
#iwontforget
If you say so. I'll be somewhere else.... anywhere else, watching something else.... anything else.
Are they really pouring in, @realDonaldTrump?
I sure wish I could be there to see this live. By this time tomorrow Obama is out of there, an America is back on track..
@ReneeinTx @Jr1Pittman
the majority of people coming to DC are coming to protest - doh.
glad you think so.... it will be horrible.
desperate snake oil
Im going to enjoy watching the Inauguration and watching Trump's hand burst into flames when he touches the bible.
Aren't the bikers there to protect you from the protesters? They are going to form a "meat wall" around U. SAD!
Actually, no - the bikers r going there to protect CITIZENS attending from any disgruntled/violent crap bags...
ummmm..not. the picture you're using is from bikers going to the 911 memorial. LOSER
If I had a face like yours I’d sue my parents.
: 
Richard M. Nixon,
Spiro Agnew,
Disgraced GOP felons,
The next one is YOU!
always believe in the Oxford comma
If they can get there without you hitting them with your car
Brown-Shit Shirts.
you have lied before, like the attendance in Hershey, I was there
I'm one of those Bikers! We're proud you are our President & we'll have your back, just take care of this nation. God bless

dude you can't count. plenty of hotel rooms left
@joanlapi2 God is watching all these Trump haters
You wish .
biker gangs for Drumpf, pathetic
My family will be watching with joy and a feeling of triumph President TRIUMP !
The pictures were fake - stolen from European biker sites
May God bless you and watch over you and your family. you will make a wonderful President
also, where are your taxes? #TrumpsTaxes
did you have to beg the bikers for Trump to come to your flop of an inauguration? Ha ha ha ha all 50 of them?
Trump, why don't you cut your hair and quit putting yellow coloring in. Its nauseating.
average man Americans
what is our country turning into .... a bunch of bikers omg... this is going to be a freak show
Wishing I could be there! I'm so pleased and proud because our future looks so bright! Thank you for restoring hope.
coming for the March against everything you stand for

VideoGameTiger
The day after will probably have much more people there protesting you than all the people combined on inauguration day!
