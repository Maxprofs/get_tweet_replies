A Japanese parliament member uploaded a picture taken by you and Prime Minister Abe on Twitter and sent out to the whole world that "Both of them are unqualified faces"

This person is Hiroyuki Konishi of the Democratic Progressive Party. Up to report.
品格のない顔。よく似た二人。

You are an absolute embarrassment to the world. Be ashamed for once.
Nice shit-eating grin.
Next time, don't indulge so much.

When #Trump smiles with foreign diplomats, he always looks like he is really constipated and trying to blast out a chunky. Good luck!

Mr President your speech was amazing tonight. You touched my heart. I believe in you 100%. Thank you
two  dogs
PM Shinzō?!?! Do y'all mean PM Abe, President Donald and Press Secretary Sean? #thirdstringwhitehouse #amateurs
@seanspicer the whole visit was a diplomatic disaster. No class, tact or grasp of hospitality. Trudeau knows how to deal.
Reporters: Look into the camera, please. Shinzo: look at me. Donald looks at him and smiles.
Two gentlemen with dignity
mean "I have zero training in foreign diplomacy protocols. What should I call this guy? And where is Japan?"
Spending More Taxpayers $ Flying around doing things you can do at White House!  Spending all that $You Lied about saving!
That would be PRIME MINISTER ....."ABE" !!!!!!! But DONNIE DON'T KNOW DAT!!!!!!!!
amazing
Why are you so orange? You're more orange than the Prime Minister's tie... ??? 
you need to sack your makeup Artist and get one who knows how to apply fake tan!!!!
President!! When you! smile you look sparkly
@di8285502 Hope thisJAPisworth yourrespect & friendship.Goodluck
what a great team you have with pence strong support for you
Mr president your stand alone strength and unwavering stand on your beliefs makes even the enemy kneel to your bold actions
Mr president .. you are Ronald Reagan incarnated.teflon heart  and mind that does not kneel to weakness .
ehee hee hee my precious
@seanspicer @AbeShinzo is a dishonorable man. Hey @potus, have u checked out how #Japan BRUTALLY slaughters Dolphins/whales
@seanspicer the look on his face when Donnie wouldn't let go. 
should have been briefed.  Japanese don't habitually shake hands.
Amateurs
when you're "like, a smart person" you don't need briefings.
Oh, sorry I forgot @realDonaldTrump is THE BEST ethnologist
as well as intellignce anaylyst
golfer
Tic Tac eater
we are in such good hands with this competent team
Repeal & replace the DOL rule with a standardized rule.
Mr. President I'm with u all the way, but Obama change the law of wet dry feet for Cubans,many are stranded in Mexico
请允许我说这叫做狼狈为奸。
