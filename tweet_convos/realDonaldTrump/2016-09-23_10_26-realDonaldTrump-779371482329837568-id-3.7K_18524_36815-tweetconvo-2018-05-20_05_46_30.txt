LMFAO. Are you really this delusional ?
You mean that 65% tax on people who have over ONE BILLION DOLLARS??? Yeah, real people give a shit about that!
No one who would consider "voting" for Clinton is a Republican, conservative, or anything close. :/
Amen! The RINO Elites and faux republicans of #NeverTrump vote ego over country. #XGOPSCUM

@HillaryClinton one last pesky little question, if estate is left by a couple, is it 1 billion?

Charlotte mayor... Fox or CNN reporter live shot stated "crowd smells of Weed an booze"
Donald, what are you hiding in your tax returns?
@vine we want to see the emails and wanna know why Hillary can get away with perjury and your talking taxes
.@realDonaldTrump you think that's going to stop republicans from voting for her when your tax plan has been shown to crush the economy?
So Ironic since none of Your Flock will ever have to worry about Estates. As long as your seed can keep up the Con.

I cannot believe 65% !!! She is getting to those that think the rich are evil. Just shows how ignorant they are!



yes I'm sure it all comes down to that while we're in terror of you getting close to nuclear codes.


They aren't getting 65% of anything that's mine!!
#NeverHillary #MAGA #AmericaFirst

Really??? Clinton Foundation ,pay for play,speeches?
You should really give the other side a look see.
#maga
There is no evidence of "pay-to-play" @GregEvery. But there is evidence in the case of Trump bribing Bondi to not investigate Trump U!
evidence really....clinton assigning her donors to positions in her state department isnt evidence?
who? @GregEvery
Rajiv K. Fernando got appointed to the International Security Advisory Board. He was a clinton donor.
EYC you're a Trumper you just don't know it yet. She's bad you know it, come aboard.
nope. She is gradually taking them all away from the Republican.

polls don't win elections, voters do!!
Okay, so stop citing polls when Trump is ahead.
told you my friend! Now go and cry with HRC!!

she will go beyond that. Enough Is Enough with this corrupt loser
Hillary is for slavery
All over again.
No way 65%tax. crazy.thief
#She should# do some real work

We don't pay estate taxes in Ohio. Will we have to pay them when she is Pres.?
@mquinn6162 @HillaryClinton the dictator wants most of our pay checks
69%

@WSJ America was founded by immigrants
I mean at the end of the day ‘go home’ is a bullshit argument founded on fear
what a clear and well thought out argument!
Poor Trumpy. You cannot even get Republicans to vote for you.
Incest WTF
An observation based on available evidence.
Wait I've heard of 1-3 but I've never heard 4, did he really say that!?
Pretty much
@YahooTV 

How the fuck is this guy potentially our president?
Perfect gif for this topic.  Love it!  Oh and I so agree that Trump should never be president. Ever!
we love you so much President Donald Trump! She wants to tax us all into submission, you want us to open our wings and fly!
The 65% tax applies to Estates with a value over $500 Million.  Not exactly "us all".
Trump doesn't want  ANY ESTATE TAX!
Any Estate under $3.5 million is exempt from tax under Clinton's plan.  That's basically 99% of the US.
JOHN WARNER. TALK ABOUT HILLARY GETTING GOP SUPPORT. HES LIKE GOP ROYALTY


Yeah. It doesn't help.
I want all to notice the small frog Pepe mascot to neo Nazi and alt right as well as black hate groups
hillary is supported by grand dragons of the KKK
not a single farm would pay this tax. Nor would an actual small business.  #facts
no, but many farms would pay 55% which is insane too.  if you think many farms net worth is less than 10 million your an idiot
that's false too. it's a marginal rate, i.e., pay zero on first $5.4 mil (2x if married). How many family farms worth $10MM?
we farm 3500 acres.  Do the math.  That's not equip or buildings or storage.  A combine n head is over 400k.  We have 2
okay--so if your estate when you die is worth more than $10 mil, you will owe tax on the amount above that.
Right.  So just in land that we own that's 25 million.  It's bullshit.  take away 55% of what we worked our asses off to get
There's no tax on the first $10 mill (if married). 50% (under HRC plan) over $20. And you're one of the richest farmers in US
the hell we are.    There are 4 family farms in a 5 mile radius that farm twice the dirt we do.
Crooked Hillary just lost the vote of every moron who thinks 65% tax on $1B estates hurts farmers. @realDonaldTrump
Hillary Clinton just lost every Republican she ever had, including Never Trump, all farmers & sm. biz, by saying she’ll tax estates at 65%.
Any 65% tax hurts everyone. It's called trickle down taxation. Morons, really?
It's called an estate tax. First encountered in Christian societies to avoid...½
@drrichswier @realDenaldTrump @realDonaldTrump
Pepe is deplorable trump knows it notice it's on every Nazi tweet
PEPE isn't a neo Nazi! Thats alot of garbage to keep the Libitards feeding frenzy going! All BS
realy
ANYONE can take a cartoon or picture and decide to use it for whatever! Proves nothing
well as you see I asked the trip ppl to come out of hiding and they did in droves all wth Pepe
not George Bush. 

Also the estate tax is for people that have more than $5 million dollars!!! That's not me or 90% of US.
Seriously doubt he even knows what an estate tax is
Bet I paid more taxes than you did last year!
When someone says I'm jealous...my response

Not fair Chris Wallace gets to be a debate monitor He just said DT only knows half what he really knows
You can literally count the number of farms affected on your strangely small fingers.
u do realize the estate tax only taxes estates over very large estates right, and only really affect 5-15% of the country?
Ask about the money for thr Earthquakes victims in Haiti.Where is the reconstruction?

oops sorry this actually 1 LIE & 1 Dream..the Republicans that endorsed her like @mcuban already knew this..it is NOT NEW!!
I'm afraid the markets and economy will collapse under you and the rural people will have something real to complain about
How the FUCK would you know?! Release your tax returns, Donnie! #ConManTrump #FraudTrialStartsSoon
Well, all farmers and small business owners who are worth more than $500 million. Actually, almost none of them.
not really... If it starts at 10million and over most Americans will agree because it only affects bout 1% of us...
And she's lost young voters mocking them  sitting in their parents basements.#HillarysUnfit
#MakeRussiaGreatAgain
all those $500 million small business getting taxed at 65%!
no one should be taxed at 65%.  It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make
can we tax estates at 65%?
we shouldn't tax them at all.
bring flowers and we will bring your rape victims OKAY?????
She should loose every vote
TAX PLANS WE BELIEVE IN. #BringBackBernie
EVERYONE, even black Americans KNOW Donald TRUMP is best for USA -
Taxing wht was taxed. Ruining family business forcing sale of holdings. SHAMEFUL. She is on the take.
@HillaryClinton
this is  TRUMP BS !!!!!!!  playing to lies and fear !!!!  not  true
Estates over $500,000,000 individually or $1,000,000,000 per couple.  I don't think the average American is concerned.
PLEASE STOP HER! That is like coming into my family's house and robbing them! Criminals get jail time for that!
Except her estate will not be taxed... ha!
. @realDonaldTrump Looking forward to the #debates!

#Trump vs #Hillary
Democrats bleed us dry when we're alive and continue to do so after we're dead...

http://www.politicususa.com/2016/09/23/hillary-clinton-drops-debate-bomb-trump-releasing-19-pages-fact-checked-lies.html …
Not true.  Why do you have to lie so much?
wow you got your a$$ kicked!
I'm mailing you a sympathy card..
The kind of things that Hillary is better at are the kind of things that decent people don't like to brag about.
Estates are handouts. I thought the right was against charity. Oh, only if it's millions from their daddies, like yours.
@slone 
The death tax is completely immoral, period. We fought a revolution over less than this blatant thievery.
#Iwonder @realDonaldTrump #Congess?? Checks And Balances On The Executive Require That The #IRS Chief Be Impeached
Mr. Trump, CNN IS full of hateful lies of the GOP and yourself.  I'm deplorable and Un Redeeming, no she is. Plz contact me
Salary taxed to get money to buy your house, then property and other taxes, then die and make your kids pay another 65% wow
@ChristiChat By the way, did her podium have a light? Why? Was she reading prepared notes? Why? Remember Nixon in 1960 !
#WeThePeopleDemandYourTaxReturnTrump  Reread the material, genius.Oh,you have? It's nt small biz & farmers who'd pay.It's U
Only applies to those whose estates are valued at over $1 billion, so you don't have to worry. Repubs still support her.
- Hwy 152, 200 miles, in California has huge flags and posters supporting Trump & Pence.
Never knew anyone who would actually nail her own coffin shut. But Hillary just did
I kno u just make stuff up but even this one is ridiculous from u
Jag-off, Hillary will only tax wealthy estates like YOURS.

you should bring it up in the debate
Isn't taxation "after" death "taxation without representation"..don't know how a dead person can benefit from tax benefits?
HRC probably supports Obama's veto. She  prefers foreigners over her own countrymen, just like unpatriotic Obama.
that is because you don't understand how capitalism works.  If capital is hoarded then our system does not work.
at least she's brave enough to show her taxes were are yours at #nowhere
Even Lying Ted didn't hid his income and Chump Foundation statements
if people don't wake up to her evilness we are doomed. Voted Donald Trump
softball for trump hit out of the park. HRC is the worst politician
How do you plan to cut corporate tax? If it is viable, I might decide to start my crop here instead of in Canada or Asia.
It just seems like talk. I have better odds moving to #spacestation #Musk
The biggest fraud ever to win a presidential party nomination. Good job republicans.
I was never with her and I am not with you either. Never means NEVER.

Your taxes idiot, your taxes!
So, Hillary's tweets are signed "H" to signify its from her directly, but she doesn't know what a "C" for classified is
it's not like you gained them, you twatwaffle.
you're right!  65% tax on money you already paid tax on!  I wonder what the foundation is paying.
Liar! This is only on estates over 500million. But I guess you know your supporters won't fact check you. Idiots.
STOP YOUR LIES! 
@HillaryClinton is NOT doing what youre implying. ONLY PEOPLE MAKING $500 MILLION are at 65%
This kind of brazen misrepresentation loses you every reasonable vote you ever had
#DeathOfAmericaTax one more nail in our economic coffin  if #CrookedHillary gets elected #StrangleHoldHillary wants it all

Most people are never affected by estate taxes.  This is something you're doing for yourself and the rich.
Perhaps invite Otto as well---actually it was Bill's first movie appearance.
You know, even is a german know that the estate tax does not apply to most people in america so..Up yours mr businessman

People say that Trump is afraid of farmers, cuz they don’t wash their hands. True?
Another blatant lie. You are literally allergic to the truth, aren't you. I bet you're terrified to be on stage with H! 
@Debramax  Hillary's 65% death tax includes Mom and Pop businesses and family farms.
