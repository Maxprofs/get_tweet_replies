actually you told your followers to shoot Hillary and became Prez. Next stop for Snoop: White House!
If @realDonaldTrump can become  president, anything is possible. #SnoopForPresident 
If all they people who mimicked killing Pres. Obama got jail time, they wouldn't have been able to vote for you.
like 90% of Twitter is shouting into a void, I'm just participating in that
WORSHIP ME I AM FAMOUS NOW

oops I get carried away sometimes
I Know That Is Why Joined it first,,,,,
@TedNugent #TedNugent

shouldn't you be focused more on YOUR JOB than who is saying what about you? FREE SPEECH  isn't America great?  
You forgot that he has no idea what he's doing? he has no experience....Impeachment Time!
disgraceful to disrespect POTUS! People need more respect for our leaders. It should be jail time!
Respect is earned,trumpy is a horrible twit,no respect.K?
This didn't age well the Democrats today admitted to rigging the 2016 (Warren and Brazil )election interfered & influenced  the election by paying Russia to interfere with the election! Trump was innocent of everything!! #FireMueller
.@realDonaldTrump A president doesn't respond like this... @SnoopDogg is an artist with freedom of speech. grow up
An artist? So any thug off the street is an artist. Crap like these are a dime a dozen
Snoop dogg is a legend you bag of bones move to facebook
You're being too nice, what she needs to do is get her dusty old brittle built ass off the internet as a whole.
You lost your ability to be treated with respect as a woman when you voted for a man who openly admitted to sexual assualt
Let me tell u I prefer to vote 4 a man that loves the US than a woman that rigged an election, or a socialist. Btw, HRC husband was impeache
Is this your way of dancing around the fact that you support the man who openly bragged about sexual assault?
New Snoop?! Shiiiit I gotta go check that out, thanks for the heads up dude. Glad you got good listening taste!
Enjoyed that! BigChoon. You not genuinely annoyed about his take on you tho, surely? No-one is that sensitive!
You're the incompetent so called president who libeled a real @POTUS44 over so called "wire tapping". Jail time! ;-)
BuLL SH**
Bot.
- @SnoopDogg For President!!!
running against @kanyewest ?
lol snoop would win hands down
"failing career" he's been putting out albums (15 to be exact) since '93 and just released his latest on may 19th. he's also done +
7 collaboration albums, he's been in 33 movies & 28 tv shows, and has maintained a good home life. try again.
Don't forget about his Emmy nomination for his cooking show with Martha Stewart.
Decent argument, but @SnoopDogg would never shoot at Obama cause Obama was an OG.
If he shot at Obama Conservatives would just scream....See Black on Black Crime!!
Can you imagine the outcry if the current "president" had BETTER THINGS TO DO than tweet about a rap video? @realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg

Lol try practicing,  the photo is so badly photoshopped, I can see the redhair in the back
Lol try again
Retard it literally barely happened it wasn't a thing that happened once a day for obama. The whole media is against trump every fucking day
Look at ur childish tweet "retard it literally barely happened"lol no thanks if I want to waste my time, it'll be with someone smarter bye 
Liberals back at it again with the leaving the conversation technique because they have no argument lmao
Blasting Erick Trumps tweets. I should be getting hell in a bit lol
where's the outcry from you when unarmed people are gunned down on the street by the police?
Please u big cry baby...... Obama was the most disrespected POTUS ever.  From wife to children.  U crying over a lil celeb death match.  Lol
You all remember this? Don John must've forgot his old white friends did this to Obama. #BoycottTrump
Odd you would mention someone else's "failing career" when yours is in the toilet. People who live in glass houses and all that, you know.
Funny (or ironic) that he mentions jail, too.
Snoop? Failing career? I think you're looking at your popularity.
Or when a candidate for president encourages the assassination of his opponent? You twatwaffle.
Just because you say someone is failing, doesn't make it true. You just can't handle criticism. @SnoopDogg you're a legend!
you mean one of the pioneers of hip hop that's worth $143 million and has 18 Grammy nominations? That failing Snoop Dogg??
why dont u call out Marilyn Manson 4 decapitating u in his video? Oh and Obama effigies were often seen hanging
He wouldn't have done that Donny... because Obama was a GOOD human being...NOT like you
Yea a great liar and sooo transparent. What a guy. From birth to school sealed
How was your up bringing? Must of been raised by white supremacist terrorists.
Threatening the President of the United States is a felony under United States Code Title 18, Section 871.[1][2][3][4]
No, wrong & silly. The previous White House knew humor when it saw it. You're mean AND somewhere on the spectrum. So sad!
That's what makes america great. #freedom of speech. U were silent when Nugent actually said he would kill obama
He must have said something to you for you to insult him.  Your mental health is questionable.
don't care bout gun violence u less it's directed to him  @SnoopDogg like the new video 
axl rose, Madonna, piers 2name a few #crickets i am more impressed at the grave digging
1) Snoop is not the 1 w/ failing career, U r. 2) Obama did nothing that he should have been shot 4, U have.
R u threatening a president?
@SnoopDog  Trump, multiple business failures, bankruptcies and Failing Miserably as potus
Love how you're the POTUS and you spend your time insulting the careers of your citizens whom you work for.
i hope the bloods come for trump now
@secret service
Weird because he didnt aim.or fire at YOU half assed distraction from an incestuous half wit (we see how you look at ivanka)
wow you sound really really mad

must be a liberal
Yes imply emotional instability when you cannot refute facts. Typical conservacuck behavior
 Protip:politics arent a binary
Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP
for the next rally fund us at 
http://Usapray4trump.com   @March4Trump RT&Share
. Snoop captured the closet thoughts, maybe some not  so closet thoughts about what people  fantasize happening
if Snoop Dogg did that to Obama Donald Trump would have supported  Snoop Dogg and even made him  richer!!!
Stupid to hypothesize because no one ever wanted Obama dead.
You think you're the shit. Can't really diss on a career when you wouldn't have one if it wasn't for your daddy. @realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg
MY suggestion is for you to LEAVE Snoop Dogg ALONE!!!!,He's PROBABLY got MORE to DOGG you about!, T.I. Is RIGHT!
So you're afraid of a toy gun 45.   @SnoopDogg   Snoop's career is soaring but not yours.  Obama remains #1
Could you imagine the outcry if you started a racist birther movement against Obama? Oh right, that was swept under the rug.
You mean like this?
Mr. President:  The Secret Service should NOT have the discretion to ignore the PROMOTION of violence against a sitting president.
I dunno Trump. Looks like Snoop winning to me.
Kathy Griffin channeled ISIS Terror directly to office of a sitting @POTUS - Please stop this terorism in it's tracks. #ArrestKathyGriffin
Maybe you should sit with @SnoopDogg and clear your head if Anyone can help you out donnie it's Snoop!
Would it be worse than the consequences that Ted Nugent faced?
what same that would Be haha
Yea, welcome to the USA, where we hold everyone to higher standards than the President.
can you imagine a president that didn't take to twitter in outrage?
Ask @realDonaldTrump how can Obama get any work done when he's golfing every weekend?

wouldn't it be nice to tweet something about someone without bullying them for once Mr President??
you need to focus on important things.
Dear President coocoo you need to stop
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN BECAUSE SNOOPY IS EXAMPLE OF NEGATIVE MESSAGES.  SAD
arrest Snoop and Bow Wow prison in a dog pound appropriate ?
when will Snoop and Bow Wow get arrested????

but your business have failed more than snoop dogg and he's never filed bankruptcy
Snoop is a pot smoking low-life. Terrible role model for our youth. He's been to jail! You must be smoking too.
but Donald trump isn't OK
.@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg 
1/Outcry from me/other critics would be extreme if actually aimed & fired at ANY Prez, but not quite what did.
.@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg 
2/No matter how much I criticize, violence or threats ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE, & I'd call Sec Ser immediately.
.@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg 
3/ I & assume,hope,pray all absolutely don't supp. threats/violence,no matter views.On that, support you 100%.
"Drop it like it's hot" has done better things for America than you have
LIKED the music video about Trump! It was http://theshiznit.com  - People of Color - Join Us.
What in the heck was the context of this craziness?!
This was in a Snoop Dogg music video lol
He's inciting #Violence @POTUS 
Shouldn't he be #Arrested? @SecretService
Absolutely.
 @realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg 
I GOT LOVE 4 U MR PRESIDENT
WE GOT DREAMS BIGGER THAN A PYRAMID
#BringDownTheRing
really Donald? i never would have seen that vid if it wasn't this tweet. #fail
...unless...this is just some epic business deal ya'l got going in which case good one Snoop.
Thank you for giving me an excuse to love #SnoopDogg even more ðŸ–’
We love you President Trump.
Keep up the good fight.
I'm sorry you have to endure such disrespect.
Godspeed.â™¡â™¡â™¡
disrespect. Wow what about the disrespect he shows to world leaders
Anyone communicating a threat such as this should be tried, convicted, and jailed. Daryl Cady
so liberals like violence????
don't let the haters get to you PresTrump, they have time on their hands.  Your supporters are busy working jobs
.@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg 
1/Your tweet makes it sound like Secret Service decided not a threat but you think they're biased toward BHO.
.@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg 
2/If intent: blamed intel, military (Yemen), Sec Serv? Seems bad for rel'ns & USA. If not meaning, then what?
@smoss @SnoopDogg can U imagine anyone who calls himself a 'dawg' ....taken seriously?
Okay.. 
WOOF WOOF
I AGREE! IT'S AN OUTRAGE!  I'm no longer a Snoop fan.  I'm very disappointed in the choice he made for his video
.PUPPY DOG IS ONLY ANGERING PEOPLE TO GAIN SOME SORT OF RELAVENCE WHICH ITS OBVIOUS HE IS LACKING WANKSTER #1
How's that failing career going Stinky Domuld?
Obama wasn't a traitor conspiring with Russia.America has a history of using the death penalty for treason. So tell me you're point again?
you called for the execution of the Central Park Five, AFTER they were exonerated via DNA.  You have no room to complain.
Yet you had NOTHING to say to Eminem? Coincidence?
@SecretService So WHY IN GODS NAME IS THIS NOT THE SAME FOR OUR PRESIDENT?! @FBI @TheJusticeDept The treatment of conservatives & TRUMP is disgusting! STOP MUELLER NOW! It is a Coup of corrupt power abusing unconstitutional investigations! DO YOUR JOB!
#love it! #SnoopDogg. I haven't heard your new stuff in a while. But I respect what your doing.
#MAGA
Can u imagine @BarackObama responding to this kind of nonsense? Like when #Republicans set him up on fire "symbolically"?He didn't, #growup
Media heads would explode live on tv if that would ever happen on the fake news CNN & MSNBC
Everyone or thing in the public schema that disagrees with you, is critical of you or you just plain dislike you call a failure. FAIL!
why do you have to put "failing career and all" you make an effort to criticize, and then you are stunned when criticized?
Don.... You should crack down on weed in CA & give cred to snoop.
Seems everyone that criticizes you is "failing". Did u ever consider that u have no clothes on? Grow up already!
.@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg Why should he get away with it? Someone sent Obama a threatening message on twitter and got 5 years in prison.
Except SnoopDog did not aim and fire a gun at you!  Fake news, Donnie?
OMG! Trump is so stupid!
nah. Those who disliked Obama wouldn't have said one word about it.
Has anyone who disagreed with you not been "failing"? It seems very coincidental.
Mr President, stay the course, I pray for you daily.
PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO RESCUE THE CHILDREN
So when you told your followers to storm DC when Obama won in 2012, should you have gotten jail time?
Don its not like most of the country doesn't fantasize about it
Dear Mr President. . Prayers are said for you daily. .Gods Blessings on all you do 
We the People stand Up for You
God Bless America
lol as of 2015 @SnoopDogg had an estimated net worth of $143 million
wow @POTUS is tweeting about Snoop why isn't someone counseling this man!?
LOCK HIM UP
Throw that arrogant pup in jail for treason!
But if he had done that to trump he would get a gold medal. Can't wait until trump is convicted of treason.
Saw Snoop Doggâ€™s album 2day and I liked it, the pretty flag and plump feet. Snoop was doing good then and doing better now. 
Idiots tweeting Snoop Dog for pres? Seriously, messed up mentality
Snoop, has-been, has to get noticed by bashing POTUS with an album cover. What ever happened to respecting your president? Sad 
Hey Mr President yes I can imagine 
We r allths together You r our Pres
n we love you praying 4 u always the
Lord God â™°Jesusâ™°is wth uâ™°
I LOVE SNOOP !!! I AM TRYING TO RESPECT YOU ! BUT IN MY HEART I KNOW YOU HATE BLACKS SOOOO BYE ! I LOVE OBAMA !!!!
A failing career?
No, the libs would have burned him at the stake like a steak!
But you are the President YOU can do something.

You think obama would let it slide and whine on twitter? 

Take some fucking action
@SnoopDogg  #SnoopforPresident Literally, ANYONE including MYSELF is far better than a  #BorderlinePersonality  who stole the election
WITHOUT A DOUBT!  God Bless and keep you for ALL of your days, Mr. President.  #MAGA!  We LOVE you!!!
It doesn't show u were murdered, just plain  old dead, a lovely heart attack?? Raw fish in  Tokyo,... heh heh
Too bad  you don't like  his freedom of speech. He's fired no gun at anyone. U cld hv died of a heart attack,..
Oh shut up. Eat some fried chicken and stroke.
Talk about being a snowflake, your supporters were literally burning effigies of Obama in the streets. Its called freedom of speech
Remember when they banned and put a warning sticker on M&Ms album for swearing
But you not Obama though!
He should be jailed!!!
His career is booming and remember you said you could shot someone on 5th ave and get away with it. STFU

Snoop Dogg, is that has been still around? I thought he moved to Canada or Africa after the Great Trump got it.
what?
Can you think at all?  Isn't that what Ted Nugent did to Hillary?  What the hell is wrong with you boy??  .....oh wait
You're pathetic. Grow up AND YOU never condemned Ted Nugent's threats on Hillary Clinton & Pres. Obama.
Lock him up we have to go after him or Jeff sessions on his Trail
Maybe you could share a cell with him.
Wait I'm drunk af that's funny though lol

Snoop Dogs Career is Flourishing Compared to YoursRight NOW! He at least has aTV ShowWITH  Ratings! WHAT IS YOUR RATING2TODAY 3?
SNOOP LET'S TOAST TO THAT!

wow!You should be worried about more important things son!You ain't a president. You a hasn't does--ident fool.
Snoop & Martha r good friends, bet she didn't vote 4 u even if u helped her to help yrself one time.
It's sad that you STILL don't understand the constitution, Donny.
U "get mad" at Snoop's "joke" but remove a kitten site that was harmless from the web?  WTF is wrong w/you?
@leadstickrick22 imploding fast!!!
His career isn't failing at all. I'd rather him push out a flag, then what sanctions your pushing out to destroy
STOP THE WINNING
Somebody call the #SnoopDogg catcher!
I guess you forgot about ted "crappy pants" nugent.  #WorstPresidentEver
And if it were a white "shooter" Sharpton, Jackson, & other thugs would be rioting and screaming racism.
can you imagine what a joyous celebration it would be if you aimed and fired a gun to your head? About time!
Trump, you are just jealous bc unlike yourself, Snoop has never been bankrupt or prostituted himself to Putin.
Pres Obama didn't deserve it!..But you do!!!..You also deserve a life time of jail for your atrocities!
http://thebea.st/2cAOo1m  via @thedailybeast
wow ignorance is your Name  Donald Fake Trump
TF TRUMP THIS IS THE SHIT GOING ON IN UR HEAD good god help us all
And fire all left overs from obomos
that  wouldn't happen bc @SnoopDogg likes @BarackObama 
Some day, all of this shit will be a matter of record, no matter how long you're in.
What about when Trump said "I could shoot someone and lose no voters."  Trump, you owe all of US an apology
So you ADMIT that YOU are a clown? Well... that's the first truthful thing you've said. It was a PARODY Google..
I wish I could have back the entire 4 minutes I wasted reading these idiotic ignorant comments #AmericaFirst
You forget to quickly.....
You do realize that was a video, right? Not reality? Oh wait, forgot who I was talking to here. You have no concept of what reality is. SMH
your entire illegitimate presidency is such a disservice to the American people.  You think it's all about you.  Sad!
do you what you are saying, because I don't
I totally support @SnoopDogg's cool video #FirstAmendment #FreedomOfSpeech FYI â€“ clowns scare me #scaryclowns
how many times did you file for bankruptcy as a "business man"?
Whether it's @SnoopDogg or @marilynmanson it's called the First Amendment. Do something useful & learn The Constitution.
