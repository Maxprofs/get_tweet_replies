Thank you. Stay strong!
What an honor to finally have an America loving @POTUS in the Whitehouse again. America, LOVE her or LEAVE! #MAGA
I stand with you but I wish you would only use twitter to encourage rather than defend yourself.
This is beautiful and I love our POTUS he is truly a true american
man that is stunning!
Hi


Love it
Looks a lot better than the rainbow colors that Obama shined on it
That's Intense!!!!
Beautiful

Every day will be Independence Day when you are gone.
Da derp de derp DERP
Please don't come back
Thnx Pres. T. used colors of pride 4 country God's blessed us with rather than cursing it & God by use of perverted rainbow
Orange, White, and Blue seems more appropriate for the White House now.
we won't be independent long with DJ Trump in charge!
I love this!!
BEAUTIFUL to see OUR WHITE HOUSE lit up in America's colors! THANK YOU, SIR!
It is the White House.  Not a trailer park abode to light up.  Multi-color does not work with OUR iconic structure.
Independence for your family? #TheRealAnonymousIsBack
So beautiful!!
Because of you it's still Red, White and Blue. Under Obama it would be Green and White by now.
كفو سلملي ع الوالدة
Seems a little... French.
Sure it's pretty. Doesn't distract from the times magazine of the white house turning Into the kremlin
American Pride
Oh Look! The White House illuminated in the flag of the Netherlands! b
Looks like a police state...
Love it that what ronald Wilson Reagan would believe in
#presidentialenough
