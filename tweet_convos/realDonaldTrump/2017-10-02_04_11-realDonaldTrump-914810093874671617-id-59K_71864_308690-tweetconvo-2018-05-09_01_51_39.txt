OMG I was speaking figuratively my God

Trump, Nixon's resignation letter was only 108 characters.

U could deliver Urs in a tweet—with room 2 blame Obama!
"Those who don't agree 2 cooperate will Be considered Disloyal, Unpatriotic, Anarchists who must not Be tolerated"
Didn't you say "only Trump can Fix It. "

Nascar believes fighting against injustice/taking a knee is more offensive than their fans waving the confederate flag. RT!!! #BoycottNascar
Trying to turn the kneeling during the anthem into being unpatriotic is the work of the devil and republicans. they breed hate and lies RT!!
Time to #BoycottNascar and let this illegitimate unhinged and hateful president that 2! can play at this game.

Hypocrite! How dare you say this to these victims and then quietly roll back obamas regulations on gun control
The Tweeter in Chief remains strangely silent about Las Vegas, except for this one staff tweet from 12 hours ago. SAD!
well I'm sure he's readying himself for trip to PR. Fitted for waders to pitch in and all. What? No?
GOD help us heal
Good man, strong leader.
OMG! HE'S THE MEANEST NASTIEST PRES WE'VE EVER HAD!
Oh sad another fake news victim. Bless your heart.
You need to sift your focus on gun laws but that wall!!!!
1 tweet on this? That's it? You tweet more about ..............(insert any any idiotic fox and friends news story here)
I pray that the cause of this tragedy is found/solved, so it won't happen again. What made him snap? Therein is the key to prevention. #MAGA
So what happens next POTUS? How many more families have to suffer with guns of this magnitude available SO easily!
Want to define your presidency with something good and historic? 
Gun control.
Think you're up to it?
Cheeto 1 tweet about this but a rampage of tweets about NFL.  Is it because the shooter was white?
Please invite a real president like @BarackObama to help you. You are so over your head. @GOP support this before he completely destroys us
"My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the" future gun deaths to come without comprehensive gun control.
Ummm...The fuck is a “warm condolence”? Are they not updating your os anymore? Who has ever said this, or heard this said? Are you a lizard?

Last tweet was almost 24 hours ago...I'm shocked!! Someone put your sorry ass in time out?
Steve Bannon should know what the "end of everything" is.  He's still trying to get a life....
GUN CONTROL NEEDED!!!
But you still consider it a price worth paying to support the American gun fetish! You are so full of it.
YOU did this-getting all the nutjobs all riled up with ur attacks on Innocent everyday Americans- gotAfeeling this madman will credit YOU
So. We gonna call this guy a terrorist?
Your response is dripping with such heartfelt emotion. Wow you had the nation in tears with your sentiment... shove your warmest condolences
Stop tweeting and go donate blood fam
Someone call the NFL owners, the commissioner bot they loaned the GOP is malfunctioning again.  #southparkstudios
Why can’t Americans come together for once? This is a national tragedy and the President didn’t cause it! Stop this awful chatter
Thank you. That was the 2nd time you said something humane
Why don't you shock everyone and decide the country does need some sensible gun control? It would be a great win for you, 80% agree.
Notice you're not calling the shooter a terrorist the way you do when they're not white.  You killed FBI funding to stop white shooters.
I think this is the most intelligent statement you have made....ever.....in life...@RealDTrump2k16
Where's all your fire and fury, Don? You know, the blame laying vitriol you spewed at foreign leaders when their country was attacked?
Betcha this JERKOFF is quite content that the news is off of his ass today! Remember, it's still RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. Don't u 4get it!
The Iceman Mueller cometh bwaaaah 

Instead of condolences send right now a proposal on #guncontrol and do Your job! Protect American Citizens and visitors to The United States
HE WAS A TERRORIST!! SAY IT, BIGOT.
But he wasn’t a terrorist..?
I think this proves the point?
Where’s the political aim..? 
No of course, you're right, he just did it for the "lols" 

#yolo
Until it’s proven he had political aims, he cannot be called a terrorist. It’s really that simple. He is a complete and utter cunt though.
It is the definition of "Act of Terror", Trump fails to acknowledge it. He fails to use a tweet that makes grammatical sense.

Trump fails.
"Condolences and sympathies"
For such horrific slaughter:
You raged at black men on their knees,
But now spout milk-and-water?
#ImpeachTrump
There is nothing warm about you
I wasn't talking about you bro

Prepare for this tweet to blow up
Unfortunately @realDonaldTrump your warmest condolences aren't sufficient to children who lost their families. If there was ever a time
..to tighten up gun regulations it's now. For a country I called home for 6 years I'm truly ashamed by your governments law processes
Heather Murren is wife of Mandalay Hotel CEO Jim Murren. CEO Jim Murren funds Terrorist groups like Antifa! Obama is behind  #VegasShooting
Heather Murren worked for Obama Leftist Shooter was Platinum member at Mandalay Hotel & was friends with Jim Murren!
Ur vocabulary is smaller than your wiener
POTUS says"P.R. threw my budget out of whack"! Did Hurricane Maria inconvenience you? We'll make sure to schedule it next time! #DOTARD!

We heard you the first time
Thanks for making it easier for mentally ill to get guns... your the one to Blame Asshole
You should learn something from what a REAL president would have tweeted....
Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.
Wow, she couldn't even go 140 characters before being a hypocrite.
Please take your #fakenews bullshit somewhere else.
Troll warning....
MAGA, Please have Oprah run for Pres in 20..

How many of you agree that Washington needs to address the mental health crisis & lack of common sense gun laws?

Gun bless america
Let's actually do something about it this time. No more sympathies and condolences. How about limitations and real change?
WORSE MASS MURDER IN OUR HISTORY???? Better gun control DOES WORK #DOYOURJOB!!!
Persian Gulf
"warmest" condolences? do you speak english? it's how a necrophiliac would refer to his "girlfriend"
"Warmest"? What the fuck?
Word salad
No one needs your condolences. What USA NEEDS is gun control laws. In the words of Jimmy Kimmel: your thoughts and prayers are insufficient.
May God Bless our Country
By striking trump with lightning
Trump declares "an act of pure evil", not pointing out the flaws of the american system which continuously generates gunmen /no life respect
U know something better than "warm" condolences? #GunControlNow! #StopGunViolence #StopNRAViolentRhetoric #trumpPoliciesStink
Thank you Sir for being a great leader... MAGA
Visiting to throw Paper Towels at Las Vegas I'm assuming?
Trump:N.Korea can't have nuclear weapons!
N.Korea:Nuclear weapons don't kill people, people do
NRA:lil'Kim's right
Trump:I need a spray tan
DEMOCRATS ARE HIGHJACKING THE VEGAS SHOOTING FIR GUN CONTROL DEBATE. HEARTLESS, WE NEED TIME TO GREET. COMPROMISE -BANNED ASSAULT WEAPON 
To all the people politicizing this, you aren't getting the point. Instead of arguing, send some love to the families affected. People died.
Yes!!!!!
It was a member of the Democrat Party who was the shooter. These Democrat and their mistress Clinton need to grow up and stop the Violence.

Does it bother you that President Obama has 5x more likes than you on the same subject?
Ban the sale of assault weapons, or those are so many empty words.
Please Mr President it's a proven fact that guns in the hands of good people stop crimes please don't let the politicians push more law
Warmest?  Warmest?  Do you mean deepest?  Do you speak English?
Who cares if Kim Jong-un gets a nuke? Nukes don’t kill people, PEOPLE kill people.
... see how fucking stupid that sounds? #GunControl
It's weird how un-angry you are about this, but peaceful protests from black athletes sends you over the fucking edge on a twitter rampage.
You know Mueller knows & has evidence on everything right? Prosecutors are just letting you speak (tweet) on the record! Nailing your coffin
God can't take the guns away but you can actually do something about it. No average citizen needs an assault rifle.
yes, your warmest condolences...? That makes no sense.
美国政府认为：扫射开始时，人们都可以拔抢出来，对射！这样比喊警察快，更安全，所以不用禁枪！
TRUMP-WE SHOULD SPREAD MORE LOVE, NOT HATE DEVISIVE RHETORIC.  THE COUNTRY NEED TO HEAL.  STOP THE BLAME GAME &. TIME TO DIAL IT DOWN
Thank you for doing a great job,, president Trump
In a few weeks:
Russia investigation
Nuclear threats
Toxic healthcare reform
Puerto Rico 
A massacre you called a "blessing"
#ImpeachTrump

God bless you all
And thank God I will never be in this s#great country governed by the worst of excuses for a president #impeach45
It was a false flag, Sir. And this is why:
 sad shit sad sHitthatssome depressingshit rightthere righttherethats what im cryin about right there mᎷМ НO0ОଠＯOଠOoᵒᵒ
Wow this sounds as fake as all the rest of your “sympathies”. Don’t even bother stepping foot in my state again it has lost all meaning
Get your balls out of the NRA money clip!
America should first try to stop its very own TERRORISTS. They are more dangerous to US than the outsiders.
What is warmest condolences? Heartfelt sadness from me?
This tweet should have over a million likes
《如果没有郭文贵》

如果没有郭文贵，你可能还在给博讯投稿针砭时弊、奋笔疾书，你会认为主机在美国的博讯会保护你的IP地址，而宁死也会捍卫尊严的韦石会捍卫你的隐私信息…

你错了，听了郭文贵和吴征的电话录音，你应该明白了为何国内有的人会突然被喝茶，突然被抓捕？因为几十万IP地址被卖
Where is your typical anger toward the shooter? Won't call him a "loser" or "terrorist"? Is this your "both sides" bs?!
We give deep / sincere condolences and warm regards.  You really don’t know how to show compassion to another human being; do you? SAD!
And God Bless the $30 million in campaign bribes you accepted from the NRA in 2016. Was it worth it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkPl8WjdlSk …
Yet no fucks given to shit that happens in mexico
You tweeted out pretty much the same thing as Obama but I’m still going to get mad at you anyways because I’m a brainwashed liberal
May God mercy come upon them
Save your condolences and do something about gun violence otherwise it’s all just talk
when the president uses an exclamation point in his tweet about the violent deaths of the people who voted for him
Look at that @realDonaldTrump you have 300K plus "likes" compared to the 1.6 MILLION likes for @BarackObama 's comments on Las Vegas.
It's terrorism not just shooting... call it white terrorism plz

SO NOW what are you going to do about it? prayers are not enough
DEMOCRATS ARE HIGHJACKING VEGAS SHOOTING. BANNED ASSAULT WEAPON & AUTOMATIC WEAPONS & GUN LIMITS. GPS TRACKER ON GUN, CONPROMISE
Seriously?! Condolences and sympathies? How about doing something abt gun control and not tkng health care from people who need it the most
还是中国安全
DOMESTIC TERRORISM DOMESTIC TERRORISM DOMESTIC TERRORISM DOMESTIC TERRORISM DOMESTIC TERRORISM DOMESTIC TERRORISM DOMESTIC TERRORISM
You write the worst greeting cards #alternativefacts #egomaniac #guncontrol #Cluelesstrump
The first bill you signed as @POTUS made it possible for this "sick man" to obtain his firearms.  You have victims' blood on your hands.
Somehow these heroic #thoughtsandprayers didn't end shootings of innocent citizens forever.
DEMOCRATS ARE HIGHJACKING THE VEGAS SHOOTING. PEOPLE NEED TO GRIEF.  RESPECT THE VICTIMS.  STOP POLITIC HACK, DIVISIVENESS
Still no word on the four Green Berets that gave their lives for the country.
This is sweet when Aunt Gertrude says it on Facebook, but you're the one who should be actuay fucking doing something about gun control.
If the mental crisis is not addressed, these type of shootings will keep happening. Didn't we learn anything from previous incidents?
Why would Donald Trump compare how many deaths Maria caused compared to another hurricane? Did he go to Yauco or just stay in San Juan? And why can't boats bring supplies to other parts of the island. It water and and island use your brains drive the boats around
Please do something. Sympathies don't mean much from a man of power who continues to make no change as deaths due to gun violence increases.
Your condolences and sympathies will not being back the dead or heal the wounded. Shove them up your ass! 
Remember the killing of biafra in nigeria come to our rescue
Why only condolences ,why should we stay like dummies in front of the shooter ... The real question to ask is why the shooter did have a gun

Make nevada great again
Who the fuck says warmest condolences? That is not a saying. No one cares about your thoughts and prayers (doubt you pray (you only prey))
But sure Puerto Rico, you have dented the budget... you excuse for a human. How dare you throw paper towels! #impeach45
It is also a warning that the prisoner is neither a Muslim nor a Korean. He is a white american!
LV POLICE LEAK! Stephen Paddock was arms dealer for FBI - The Rabbit Hole runs deep on the chans. #LasVagasShooting
Remember, President @BarackObama visited privately with every Sandy Hook victim's family. #leadership
Be blessed.
can you tell us what the difference between this & terrorism is? Is it a religious or racial thing?  This was more than a 'shooting'
To every family affected by the senseless act of hate. America is Kneeling in prayer. But will always Stand in Unity. 
Why can’t consider this shooting as a terror attack?
Those commies in gov't touting #GunControl need to be taken out by militias since we don't have a military protecting our country or rights.
It's time 
The only blood spilt on American soil should be those communist & islamist who are actively engaged in destroying our Republic.
A good job as our president! I would love to me you but I know your A busy man. Michael Parker is my name and may God richly bless you !
I am mentally not capable of handling money I am married and she helps me . But I have a a dream of mine that you and I would meet one day .
I have been so happy that you became our president of the United States of America. You are the best president ever . And you believe God .
I am praying for you and you're family everyday. Please know that we have you on our prayers list at church. May God Bless you !
Please let a disabled female Marine respond to McCain's crap, especially during this crisis!  Daughter and mother of Marines, PLEASE.
不管咋说，还是默哀吧
"Warmest condolences"?    Who says that?
The worst massacre under YOUR watch. Not @HillaryClinton not @BarackObama not even @GeorgeHWBush but YOU.  You!
Actually fucking do something about this instead of bullshit responses
Dear my name is Michael Parker and I would love to meet you but I know your a busy man. I love you as our president and you are doing a good
Hypocrite

Time for you call it what it was .... ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM!’  @WhiteHouse
The repatriation to bring the money back to the U.S. is a must pass under any circumstances!
Have the courage to #MAGA by standing up to Republicans and NRA. No one tells you what to do, you are the boss! Make American Safe!
and won't be a absolutely right opinion. It should be discussible and revisable.USA need a discussion about

Empty words from an empty head
your condolences are not enough -- why don't you work on regulating what allows the evil you speak of to be carried out indiscriminately?


condolences are great:however, fishing licenses say u can only fish w/3rods, why can't congress limit gun ownership to 3 on permits
Seriously now: Who SAYS "warmest" condolences? 

Someone who has NEVER offered them.

You're very bad at the EASY parts of this job, #Resign
Why don't you do something too change it? Oh because your "base" wouldn't shower you with praise...ok 
The NRA donated $10.6 million to your campaign while 49 Republican senators voted AGAINST background checks. More blood to come 
@stevenmnuchin1 why you didn't say that to the people of Puerto Rico ' or the people of the US Virgin Islands...
