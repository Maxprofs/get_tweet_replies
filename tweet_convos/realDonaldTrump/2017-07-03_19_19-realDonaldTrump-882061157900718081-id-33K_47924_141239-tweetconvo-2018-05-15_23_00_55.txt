You are constantly on twitter with your deranged thoughts..so the real question is; do YOU having anything better to do with your life??
Do you have anything better to do with your life than tweet??? Like be the President...
Do you have anything better to do@than tweet all day?
Donny Trump has just whined about the media. Does this guys have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that Melania Trump...
Cue the Democratic outrage...
He can always Sumo Wrestle.
Pot meet kettle.
Don't you have anything better to do with YOUR life than being a loudmouth bully and being weak towards real enemies like Russia & putin
You have no idea what you are doing. Jealous of President Obama. You will never measure up.
Anything better to do than tweet, Mr. President?
Take your pills.
LMAO, u r so funny Donnie, as if u don't have anything better to do then tweet
 Look who's talking!
#presidentlittlehands
He is just trying to keep up to Space X
It's better than tweeting nonsense at the media like you specialize in. You're mean tweet will definitely stop future launches. Tough guy
Remember when you called Kim Jong Un a "pretty smart cookie"? Good times.
For real though, the President's tweets are making the North Korea situation worse.
As tensions rise again in the Korean peninsula, here's some advice for Donald Trump:
Is this dude actually defending N. Korea's right to possess nuclear weapons?  You want Kim Jong to have nuclear weapons?
If we allow N. Korea to develop nuclear weapons, history will not look back fondly on this generation of world leaders.
Are you fucking crazy??
Could say the same about you
well at least he's not tweeting while he poops .....
Are you hoping they will be reading this tweet? Are you gonna wrestle China because they wont make Japan call  Godzilla to stomp through nk?
Um... this is the most ironic tweet of the day.
neg him into submission
You TWEETING "Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?" is the absolute height of irony!
Why can't you ever take a diplomatic solution to things like this? Why do you have to TAUNT a crazed ruler with nuclear weapons?
Why do you act like a puss all the time
Make America Great Again, Donald!
#MAGA
Pot, meet the kettle.
Do you have nothing better to do than this?
Lol
Lmao do you have anything better to do with your life besides tweet? Like maybe run a country?
Haven't you learned anything yet...the bigger threat you make the US look the more urgent NK needs to have a intercontinental missile.
North Korea is throwing tantrums and we have a lying, incompetent clown-baby in the Executive.
Man, reporting all the trumpbots is exhausting.
Maybe he could take up tweeting. 

The lack of insight in this tweet is truely amazing.Bigly,most huge lack of insight ever.Believe me.
Ha! You mocking someone else for how he spends his time as President ~ You watch TV 5 hours a day and then hate-tweet for an hour!
Quick, someone ask him who #CharlieGard is.  
Tweeting seems to solve everything let's get that guy a smart phone.
He's your Korean clone!
Perhaps if #USA and #Japan didn't have mock NUCLEAR ATTACKS on #NorthKorea EVERY YEAR, They might not be as Defensive??? #KoreanPeninsula
This guy is a crazy hahaha
do you have anything better to do with your life than tweet 90 times a day?
Says the one who sits and tweets all day long.  .
Stop trying to start a war to distract from your treason. #TrumpRussia
You mean the treason that doesn't exist because after over 6 months and 7 separate investigations has produced 0 evidence? #MAGA
That's why they're investigating!  We won't know the outcome yet. It's ongoing, so stay tuned!
Do you have anything better to do than egging on WW3 on Twitter? Celebrating USA's B-Day? Or working in the situation room?
"Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?" is the rhetorical question Americans ask each morning. About you, Mr. President.
US just went from Obama's polished diplomacy to Trump provoking the most unstable world leader with mafia-style "this guy" tweets. But MAGA!
Pushing South Korea, Japan & China to stand up to Kim Jong-Un using Twitter? We could do without this Reality TV approach to foreign policy.
One could argue Bill Clinton created this mess by negotiating a failed  nuclear deal. Doesn't it worry you that LA/SF are prime targets?
Seems to me we should be doing everything possible to coax China and Russia into action to prevent a major catastrophe on their doorsteps...
Bill Clinton paved the way to a nuclear North Korea and Obama wouldn't dare confront China. We need ACTION!
Where are your Dear Leader's ties made?
Same could be asked of Trump. He has spent more of his presidency watching TV, rage tweeting, and playing golf than any of his predecessors
He's spent more than 1 in ever 5 days playing golf http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/how-much-time-trump-spending-trump-properties-n753366 …
Think about this, do we really want Trump spending more time on the job?
I think it could be good. Let him wear himself out trying to work for the first time in his life.
Maybe he'll have a massive coronary climbing out of a sand trap.Can pray
Because they see what your country has done to others and feel threatened! Only truthful sincere peace talks will stop this nonsense.
Your in charge of the most powerful country in the world. You should be able make a peace deal and bring an end to shows of military might.
That guy is sick
Wow. Our president. SAD. Like, really. :/
Maybe our ambassador to South Korea could step...Oh, wait. You've never nominated an ambassador to South Korea.
account I just tweeted @davidaxelrod from ur official POTUS account so my tweeting on ur personal account my frustration 4 field of politics
Gnt@
Can you please realize the gravity of this and not say stupid crap that provokes a missile launch?
And you're on twitter
Maybe he feels your pain, having small 'appendages' - he builds missiles, you take on jobs out of your grasp!
This is a stupid remark.
Then what u going to do about it let him keep on to he makes one that will reach us or just go on take him out he dont fear u he is satan
Does @realDonaldTrump have anything better to do then make stupid tweets. Like maybe run a country
Way to handle this awfully scary situation with a tweet that makes you sound like a 13 year old. And that's disrespectful to 13 year olds
Similar to what happened to Sadam Hussein,who was judged by his own People! Many lives wld be saved!God bless U with wisdom Mr President.
more than you and your tweets?? Fake tweets, fake tweets!!
Old Don & Kim have a lot in common - mentally, egotistically, verbally & they are both bullies. Now that's a problem!
Very funny bcos it is the same question everybody is asking about you.
#25thAmendment
We feel the same way about your tweets
No he dont hes begging for a ass whipping and I think we need to give it to him
Trump has just launched another tweet. Does this guy have  anything better to do with his life?
You said you weren't going to let that happen!
They do it to piss you off, they don't know their poking a tiger in the eye with a very short stick.
guess, he doesn't like golf, like his father did
You are doing extended tweets wrong. Try posting them so they can be naturally read as we scroll down your feed.
At some point there will need to be a preemptive strive on N. Korean to protect the USA. @MssLiberty
You're a bit too transparent at times, ....or just plain lying.
You're as slippery as an eel in soapy water, you still deny the Russia hack is real, that is a problem, and probable cause to C YUR TAXES
Trump is my President
YOU need to do better things with your life as President than tweet and play golf!
North Korea will get struck missile need solve down!
This coming from someone who can't stop golfing, tweeting, watching, and screaming about news programs is moronic. You're completely unfit.
Wow, really dude?  Glass houses. Of course your hands are so small they probably cant hold larger stones.
Do you have anything better to do with your life other than tweet incessantly while you do nothing but suck up to Putin?  #TrumpIsATraitor
they couldn't have, you said with confidence it wasn't going to happen, remember? Is this more fake news.#godsaveamerica.
Says the man on fucking twitter not running his country
Great, you are going to get us killed, you aren't strong on foreign policy :( #NorthKorea #tinytrump #impeach2018
BIG SMILE!
You do these by tweeting about him almost every day.He is just like you. So he is acting out just like you....
You were a smart mouth to him & he is paying you back in the only way he knows how to, unfortunately it puts the entire world in danger.
Google the word, irony.
Why are you tweeting rather than meeting with your cabinet about averting WWIII?
Fire when ready President Trump. America has your 6!
"Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?" Wow, Trump, finally you feel what half the world feels about you!
strong statement??what you gonna? do about it?
...has universal health care?  has a longer life expectancy than americans?
taunting a guy over twitter that can easily blow up Alaska probably isn't the best idea
Don't you have anything better to do with your life instead of ruining all of our American lives? #seriouslygetaclue
Was asking same question about you. Get off your phone.
Why don't we just shoot these missles down once they are over international waters? What can they do about it?
You sound like a 13-year-old girl complaining about petty bullshit...But, you are petty and full of bullshit so I guess it works for you.
North Korea simply says, "I am now a member of the world's most powerful nuclear powered countries! I love it!" Would it true or false?
Can't tweet your way out of a "real" problem can you?
Just add more fuel to the fire. If you get hit dont blame anyone but yourself. You n your family will be safe but what about all the US
Hard for many of us to figure out why you spend more time Tweetin silly as tweets, "while our "Rome/home" burns! Please karma visit the Don!

Tal vez nos odiemos, pero en esta ocasión considero que, tanto México como Estados Unidos unan fuerzas para acabar con esta amenaza
WWTD!
At least he doesn't sit around tweeting and golfing
Blessed is the peace keepers
Do you realize that you are supposed to be the Leader of the Free World and YOU as Leader are supposed to handle these situations?
Are you for real?
Look who's asking! Tweeter in chief!
Parece  que el chico quiere  jugar, con juguetes peligrosos
S Koreans would be jumping for joy if u take these proposed actions w neutron bomb once i explained to them what they do and how they work
Ha! You asking if someone has anything better to do with his life, that's amazing, we say the same exact thing when you tweet.
No he hasn't when you back them into a corner the only option they have is to fight why don't you try backing off and lifting sanctions
This is something a teenager would tweet. You are demonstrably unfit, and your handlers are cretins. Hard to believe this is USA.
please go away
shut up!  Let the State Department handle this, you may be right, but you do not have the vocabulary required for the job.
Why are you tell me Mr President, it's your JOB so fix it. Get off twitter
The same question could be asked of you and your tweets. "Does this guy have anything better to do?"
Wait. U spend most of your day on twitter, golf or watching cable news that u say u never watch. You want to know if HE has anything to do?
Like playing golf and watching 5 hours of tv a day and tweeting incessantly? #25thAmendmentNow
Feel it for Americans, your president is a keyboard warrior
Do you have anything better to do with your?  Stop tweeting about cable news people.
Officially end the Korean War. Sit down with him. Have you really read about the horror of that war? He is psycho. But think before acting.
Work with Putin and China and listen to their ideas.
Blame Truman he should have let McArthur finish it in the first place
Don't YOU have anything better to do then starting a war w NK? Hard to believe the Mueller is taking this long #LockHimUp #Loser
That's what he probably says about your tweeting.
FFS you're going to get us all killed you hypocritical man baby. Diplomacy over Twitter.
Start by appointing an Ambassador to South Korea!
Maybe he can learn to Tweet and you two can have a TWITTER WAR numb nuts both!
You want to put up a wall ,ban immigrants to protect U.S. N.Korea wants to bomb us ,what have you done to stop that?!!!!!!!
He's a threat to the entire world, allies and enemies alike.  He's a threat to his own people, too.  Time to get rid of this psychotic man.
The same could be said about you and your twitter habits... those who live in glass houses...
you need to stop putting the United States in jeopardy do to your disability of conflict an wars GOD WILL SEE YOU
"Does this guy have anything better to do..." says the 71 year-old man who rage tweets at 5am.
 apparently that's the funniest hobby of his
Donald Trump you're the best thing that happened to America keep up the good work and God bless you
Dear President you talk about to do, and talk and talk...and North Korea launches missiles in your backyard.
Maybe he should golf more.
Do you not have anything better to do #fake president
North Korean leader Kim Jong Hoon
I thought you loved him like you do all crazed dictators? Did you forget? Did you take your pills? You're too old and tired for this. SAD.
So Kim fires off missiles, unlike you who fires off your big fish lipped face & irritates & threatens people,mostly women.
Must be bedtime. POTUS should really dig deep and ask himself the same question. Sad!
That guy isn't any smarter than you Donnie boy!
Nope just walk his baby nuts all around North Korea trying pull a hitler he is ..
Don't YOU have anything better to do with your life than constantly whining on Twitter like a teenage girl?
Well at least he isn't tweeting videos about attacking news stations
Wow. Pot and kettle. Neither of you is doing anything productive. Do you have anything to do beside believe @FoxNews and tweet like a girl?
That's it, insult the world's most dangerous and unstable dictator who currently has possession of nuclear weapons of mass destruction
Sanctions don't work. How many years now?  Mocking us. China has there back. Time to turn on the fireworks.
Well, they have o Twitter.
have someone FIND you pix of what WE did to Japan and THEN decide if you want to dis "this guy" who's got nukes that'd reach Alaska or DC?
@SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC #25thAmendment for the love of God and all that is holy- before this incompetent idiot causes a nuclear war!
This post is so comedic in its irony that it honestly ought to win a Pulitzer.
He fires missiles and you tweet. I can see the resemblance.
Maybe the missile pictures are fake behind a green screen?  Just maybe.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Really, does a President express himself that way in 2017 ? I feel like I'm standing next to a drunkard in some creepy hooker bar...
Damn, just shut up and do your job. Or, do you ever really shut up?
喧嘩売るのやめーや
違うよドナルドダックだよ

え？これドナルドちゃうん？
SAYS THE GUY WHO TWEETS ALL THE TIME BUT OK.
I'm pretty sure he's tweeting the exact same tweet
Do you have anything better than tweets to do with your life? Try studying, reading, learning about the job you have and are not doing
.......... only launch his missles if we attack first. America never attacks first. God Bless!!
@Patta_Boy
ア、メ、リ、カ、love
Really enjoying these "modern presidential" tweets.  Sad......
America have allowed this thorn to embedded deeply in it's side. And now over a period of time it has infested the whole body.
Wtf
Launching missiles  is his past time just as tweeting is yours.  Both are dangerous n not beneficial to either nation
We wonder the same thing everytime you tweet something...
Looks as if chubby doesnt have anything better to do. For one thing for sure he wants to attack the USA
You  tweet  and  play  golf.
... and the rest of the G20 has to deal with fuckups like you instead of actually fixing the world's problems
Pot - Kettle
Kettle - Pot
Have you guys met?
President Trump:  Please stop tweeting. If you have this much time on your hands I'd suggest working on strategy.  On many fronts.
What about the Russia cyber attack on our election American first
Kinda like a #FakePresident who tweets lies all the time.
He wants to take over the world. Good to know there is no one left in his family to carry on... after he is gone. God speed.
He's insane ... need to eliminate him
Mr. President. Please note that like any society, NK needs peace, justice and human persuit of happiness. USA is expected to deliver.
