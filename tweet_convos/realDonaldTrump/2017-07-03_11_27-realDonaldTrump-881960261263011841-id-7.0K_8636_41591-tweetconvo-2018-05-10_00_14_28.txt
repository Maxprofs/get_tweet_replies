I notice you missed the popular trend...
Lots of them around...
More Americans back this message than support @realDonaldTrump ....
They're available for many different sports....
I use them to wipe my ass
You can buy @realDonaldTrump toilet paper for that. In Europe, we even have Trump urinals. Google it 
I bow to your superior knowledge. I hadn't heard of any...
Good to see the twitter character count is working 4 you .. two high a number 2 count for SOME!

#PresidentBannon #Bromance #VoterFraud #VoterSuppression
Proof of #voterfraud I called all the states #ND #KY and #OR that had my Green card holder hubby registered to vote !
I've been a web / database developer and worked for local gov't. It could be a fluke with the data or someone's pet project, or yes fraud. 
A fluke in 13 states? #OR #ND and #KY had him registered with SSN. That's a big #fluke called #voterfraud by #dnc
By that I mean flukes happen. Cheap outsourced database admins (even some higher qualified) play around with live rather than test data.
If someone dicks around at a higher level, that stuff can propagate. It's often organized chaos in the database / programming world. 
And sure, people with that level of knowledge + political motives might tamper with voter data. It's possible.
Which means that anyone could vote - the state of #KY its up to the integrity of legal or illegal immigrants not to vote ok but **
3 million less votes than Hillary - 10 less than hillary and third party candidates -  Trump is the most hated MINORITY prez
I love love love our President and entire family I wish I had brothers and sisters as rich as they are.
RICH IS NOT THE ISSUE. THE MAIN THING IS THIS PRESIDENT WANTS TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW, SOMETHING PAST PRESIDENTS OVERLOOKED
Trumpanzee responding to troll
So what
@realDonaldTrump knows @BarackObama has gained more followers since leaving office than Trump since taking office. Snicker. #25thAmendment
"Data Operation" is code word for Russian collusion regarding a technological psychological warfare. Congrats. You committed treason.
0 evidence anywhere and you are still holding on to that one? Time to believe a different lie from CNN, don't you think?
So the 17 intellegence agencies  arent credible? You must still be drinking the treasonous parties kool-aid.
Can you name all 17 bey u cant just passing along bullshit
I sure can can u? The only one passing around bullshit is your ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT and his supporters.
Watched seventies series Watergate sounds very close to Trump's admin and goings on.
So what, you insecure jamokes?
You misspelled "Russian interference" and "illegal redistricting."
Due to gerrymandering.
Nice suck up Reince. Too bad it won't save your job. #failure
Trump trolls are fake Patriots!
You take victory laps over an election that happened months ago while millions of Americans are in danger of losing healthcare. GROW UP.
Lmao but he LOST Russia won #bloatedmess #trumpkissass
Old news. Last years elections. Your continued obsession is proving we must invoke the 25th, you're unhinged and you endanger the nation.
So now that You are POTUS, GET TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE, AND SHOW US YOUR TAX RETURNS. This is the least we expect. This is what we deserve.
A strong candidate?

1. Bragged about sexual assault.
2. Ran a fake university that stole millions. 
3. Insulted POWs, disabled, and women.
At least he isn't responsible for murdering soldiers in Benghazi or losing classified information or losing a billion tax dollars
Fake news
The President loves America!   Apparently the Dems don't.
Revolutionary data program a.k.a cheating by hacking the voting machines

#FuckTrump
Taken over by BOTS. Just as election was taken over by BOTS.

BOT MUCH?
Hope it last because we I'm Missouri want to throw that Right to Work klusterfck Gov out on his ass
Frank Burns eats worms.
When will you guys stop taking victory laps over a questionable election where you DIDN’T WIN THE POPULAR VOTE and actually help Americans?


Health care for all your campaign promises
Mo Ron
Wait - u won Wisconsin? Did you also win the Presidency? #jackass #resign
Thank god
You mean @POTUS stupid? He definitely is not strong.
37% support him. 47% say Impeach him.
How about carrying it with fair policies and intelligent decisions? You fight a war. In your country. @DNC @GOP  #resist #aca #Science
Do you have a lawyer yet, Reince?
With a boatload of help from Putin! Lock him up!
This tweet hasn't aged well. Y'all going to prison. Traitors.
Good news for a change!
Any state 45 may have "won" the majority vote is a lie.  Why do you and 45 keep dwelling? Because you know the election was stolen.

WOW! First time in 30yrs? Amazing!

да, что программа данных, которую мы сделали, была очень эффективной.
https://twitter.com/Reince/status/881942467578400769 …
This photo and your fake "winning" concept are so dated and not relevant that there are Christmas trees on my screen now.
You, McConell, Ryan all know it's illegal to accept foreign campaign contributions (from Russia) yet you accepted at the RNC. Hope you die in jail, Reince. You deserve it, selling out America.
This looks like good evidence in a criminal trial. Good luck Reince!
Sure, and the fact 17 American intel organizations all agree that Russia hacked the election to help Trump win had nothing to do with it.
Only 4, and still not confirmed. NYT retracted.
ONLY? An intelligent person who gave two shits about anything besides 'winning' would be worried about ANY interference in our elections!!
Lol
Wonder why?
Regardless which though I thoroughly agree...he belongs HERE.

Russians helped trump we all know that
Still your president
True
Tweet why won't you print my messages John Dawson
RT @Reince: With a strong candidate in @POTUS &amp; @GOP revolutionary data program, Republicans carried WI for 1st time...

Write your representatives and let them know you will vote against them if they vote for the Tax bill.  https://www.house.gov/representatives 
"GOP revolutionary data program" = Russian hacking.
Combine that with voter suppression and it is pretty revolutionary, albeit evil.
Cleaning up voter rolls from people who dont vote after 4 years isnt suppression.
A would be voter has the responsibilty to make sure he is registered if he hasnt voted in years.
I assume you would be outraged if pushed off voter rolls and not notified. Why would anyone anticipate such a thing happening?
It isnt the states job to notify you. If you havent made voting a priority. That is on YOU.
Voting is a RIGHT. What justifies the state setting an arbitrary deadline to purge people from the rolls without notice?
Voting most certainly NOT a right. You have to meet qualifications to vote. A right is inherent.
With today’s Cambridge Analytica new I suspect Mueller will be stopping by again.
With help from Russia
@PreetBharara @AGSchneiderman @RWPUSA @Khanoisseur wonder what kind of Revolutionary data PROGRAM Reince is talking about?
I think you and the @GOP all know what you data program did for Trump in WI....
There's nothing quite like a remote controllable tally and zero reasonable audit to guarantee success.

The data operation Parscale directed was supervised by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has landed in Mueller's crosshairs over his contacts with Russia's ambassador and the CEO of a sanctioned Russian…
Kaspersky Labs?
HOW UNBELIEVABLE @AGSchneiderman @mikefarb1 CHEATERS! @HillaryClinton is the real President!
“Data Operation” is a weird way to spell voter suppression combined with Russian cyber warfare. Go kick rocks.
Go Trump
Is this some sort of JOKE?!?

revolutionary data "program" was PII (person identifiable info) data laundering 2 weaponize fake news. Thanks for singing cc: @FBI

I find it hard not to BARF when Speaker Ryan call giving huge tax cuts to wealthiest "Transformational." I call it APPALLING!
Can you call it a "strong candidate" when he barely won, & we're still not sure about Russian interference?
Yeah, and that data operation was run by the Kremlin.
Still reliving the election? Sad! Move on and do your job
The swamp is getting drained. I am proud of the work being done.Ron from Lincoln Montana
Hmm, Real curious about that data program. It will be so very, very interesting when more info is available on that.
Voter manipulation, extreme gerrymandering & voter suppression. If @GOP isn't cheating they rn't trying. WI despise u!
So now you are bragging about voter suppression?
PS: Reince- don't forget, even though WI supported Trump last year, doesn't mean they do now. You are trying to MISLEAD people w old news!!
I am I am so x

Don't let the Runaway Bunny aka @Reince on the plane-remember last time...@FBI
Keep up great work Mr. President!
SOLD your 100 million dollar project to a madman #TrumpRussia #Russiagate #Reince #Resist America The government lies and is CORRUPT
Is this the program that will put Jared in prison and totally remove any credibility concerning the Sack O' Lies in Chief?
And the Russians hacking the DNC server while candidate Trump cheered them on and encouraged them. Still lost the popular vote by millions
fu republicansl the party that is out to screw everyone!!
I wonder what states your comrades targeted with their fake news? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @VP @mike_pence
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP is that the data you hacked and then left on a public server to get hacked?
You people need to wipe orange off your lips
I tend to believe a data hack occurred.
It's not that revolutionary.
All of you people are so funny get a life and move on

Also, what's with the Christmas trees in the background. Why are you showing such an old picture? What are you trying to pull off????
Thank God for men not "dipped in stupid."

I think maybe your thank you should be in Russian you know so you can reach the real party you need to thank #TrumpRussia
Hillary is still crying Russians. Kek. Happy 4th Mr President Trump. Pro move when you took down CNN
So the Hyenas are licking and sniffing each other's privates.  If Trump requires constant praise to function, he is not fit for the job.
He didn't win because of of that. Russian help Trump.
Would that be Russian Revolutionary data program?
That and the Russian propaganda repeated by Trump daily, along with Russian hacking, fixed the election. Tyranny.
It's time to discard the electoral college
#LOCKHERUP
I'm sure it was a "Data Operation." 
Time to sue Drs.Trump & Putin for malpractice. 
(And injuries.)
Nah, you really didn't, cupcake. #unhackthevote
Yeah, "data operation," that's what it was. #TrumpRussia collusion is more like it.
ZERO=RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. HILLARY,OBAMA,PPODESTA HAD MORE INTIMATE COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA THAN ANY CONSERVtive.look it up
Had a bad night on the soaps, sweetie? Those aren't real stories either, you know? HINT: Caps Lock Off will help you feel calmer.
You're an O holdover! Resign already before "YOU'RE FIRED"!
Was that data operation or data manipulation?
Russia's operation
Remember the importance of truly free press & the sacrifices all of   us as citizens must make to expose the truth.
With a strong candidate in @POTUS & @GOP revolutionary data program, Republicans carried WI for 1st time in 30 years.
- cough- kiss ass -cough- #idiotinchief #babyinchief #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow #Impeach45
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP @CapTimes you all should be ashamed of yourselves
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP @CapTimes my husband played for the packers.  No support from him.
Too bad you endorsed Ryan over Paul Nehlen !
but,
 We Love you anyway !
You neglected to mention his friends in Moscow.
All this winning is exhausting. #MAGA
That was that last-minute 1%, which occurred, coincidentally, in Florida and Ohio as well. Hmmm...it all happened at the same time, too.


Yes, the MANIPULATED DATA with the aid of #Russia DID help install Trump in Wisconsin! Nice of you to admit the #CrimeFamily was successful
Tired is an understatement
Trump helped Trump in WI, People heard what he said.
Strong candidate; still laughing. trump's so out of touch he doesn't even know that a 33% disapproval rate is historically bad.
Be careful, @reince. Mighty close to losing plausible deniability. Might close. Mueller WILL flip you like Putin flipped Trump.
You are all ruining America, have no American standards, and need to be removed from office before the complete demise takes place.
You mean "stole"
let's Go Lions...
Yeah it was revolutionary!! The kind that gets Jared in time out!!
The RUSSIANS hacked into the voting machines! RUSSIANS WON! Long live Russia!!!!!!
@Reince is a traitor to American values!
We're still talking about you winning the election? Great. I wanna keep talking about your connection to Russia then.
No doubt the Democrats will blame the Russians
#FakePresident
Revolutionary data program? You mean this?
https://goo.gl/GhT1qz  @KeithOlbermann
what?! another rigged election!!!!
Ever figure out what was up with those voting machines with the damaged tamper seals? What are those seals for again?
It just seems like, if y'all just shrug when you find machines that have been compromised, kinda defeats the purpose.
So easy to show WI was rigged amazing you would brag. How long before someone flips and you go to jail

That revolutionary data program was run by Russia right?
What happens when WI voters realize they  have no health care and the most vulnerable are victimized to give tax break to 1% rich.  Go Bryce
Not anymore...it will turn!
You forgot to give out gratitude to Donald's friend Putin.
I'm sure that's interpreted as the Russian data program. Cheaters, every last lying one of you. How do you sleep at night?
Don't forget Russia's help
Figures. Green Bay Packers suck and so does the president.
Got the pizza fellows.
Uh, wasn't that eight months ago?
Donald Trump for eight years amen God bless him Donald Trump for 8 years he'll be our president amen God bless him
......and a little help from Putin & Co.!
Trump's a Troll. No respect with established allies. US values exposed by him. Worst President ever. A disgrace on the GOP. A global circus.
.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump apparently has nothing to say. Why is he speaking?
WI was rigged.  Enjoy the last few weeks in our House before you're ass is booted out and charged w/your crimes. #Conmen #TrumpRussia
After all the Presidents tweets, it will be the last time that a republican win that state.
