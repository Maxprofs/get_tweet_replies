Isn't this an attempt on your part to get credit for something you had ZERO to do with?
Praise God. Thank you Pres. Trump for doing a good job for America in spite of the DNC & Liberals.
The profit margin that arises from corporate utilization of cheap, foreign labor is instead capital that goes to..
lowering the deficit and bolstering domestic business growth, thru incentive. Not to mention funding programs..
that promote the general welfare, specifically education.
can we get a reason why?
Microsoft / SoftBank
Way to go Mr. President!!!! We are so proud of you!
or is it that you just don't care? All about your business cronies? How much will Trump gain off this deal?
you really have no clue what you are doing to the middle class, do you?
wow, we (usa) have been trying to block this deal for years because of anti monopoly laws.
US security regulator is actually holding back the SoftBank deal. Thoughts Mr Trump?
u  r  going  to  be a  great  president  ,

a president like none other ! God bless  Donald trump and his family and protect them while they make America great again!
And you had nothing to do with this.

Funny, that's how this clown got elected in the first place. I have no time for Twitter trolls tho. BE GONE!
Yuge!!!! You will be the President who will turn USA into Greatest Country Ever!  Exciting news!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@Dereksnow51Snow @realDonaldTrump 
God will use Trump mightily to restore
the USA in being the great nation
it used to be.
God would never choose a rich man as his instrument. You are wrong.
God is never wrong!!!
But the American electoral college often is.
In a representative republic, the leaders are not chosen by God.
he has already sold himself out.
how has he sold himself out
bowing to corporate interests
oh, so that's why Obamas term was a big fail
but Obama actually made large dents in unemployment where Trump just saves 800 jobs
. You're actually kidding with that statement, right?  More people unemployed than ever
Obama brought unemployment below 8%
"Soft bank?" sounds like a bank for cucks, like you, the president elect donald trump @realDonaldTrump

hm, a "red pill" wrestler who likes making gay VR porno shoot photoshops, interesting
Are you implying there is something wrong with homosexuality? It's 2016, bigot. And I'm not a wrestler, thanks.
yes you are

wrestling is fake you fucking dork lol do you put on some cool cape and hop around in your underwear that's cool
See me at WrestleMania, dolt. One on one.
you are a liar and cannot be trusted.
because WP is a trusted news source.. their a propaganda rag and you my friend are pissed cuz now you'll HAVE to work!! Plenty Jobs
Actually I'm gainfully employed sir, maybe because I can compose a basic sentence with proper grammar and spelling.
Well Mr. Grammar, maybe you should spend time supporting your accusations.
What's the point when you're debating people who refuse to believe the words of the very workers being screwed?
no one got screwed more than the middle class w Obamacare.. that alone was reason to vote Trump
A loved one of mine couldn't get healthcare before Obamacare because she has MS. She deserve to get sick and die?
I'm sorry to hear that.. My son was diagnosed 10 yrs ago. None of his docs accept ObamaCare.. "u can keep ur doc"
so that's 51,012 jobs created so far and not even in office. 30k less then @BarackObama created in 8yrs. Hahahaha! Love it!
50000 new jobs with a great way to start and you're not even in the office yet
I doubt these jobs will be created before Jan. 20th/so it will be on Trump's watch
I hope so...ob is trying to already take credit for anything positive
like the NDAPL... OBAMA didn't do a damn thing for that
I remember those tears..Hot sauce in eyes for false flag SH
SoftBank / Microsoft
.@realDonaldTrump can't wait for you to say your own Department of Labor Statistics is rigged
How did this cute kid turn into a sociopath? Many people say it was a lack of love and attention. He really hates himself.
@chestnut_daniel @realDonaldTrump My bet? Abused and emotionally abused/neglected as a kid.
Nope. Just never told "No."
That, too.
Some would call it the greatest form of abuse.
damn, now liberals hatin' on children lmao love the hate and hypocracy
Now you're grasping at straws.
He's not grasping at all.
asqueroso
SoftBank / Microsoft
Soft Bank / Microsoft
Who's businesses???
You are an illegitimate president installed thru the help of a foreign adversary. Nothing you do wiil ultimately stand. Nothing you say matters.

Microsoft / SoftBank
SoftBank Hong Kong / Say
let's see these 50,000 new jobs first and then we can talk.....talk talk talk vs facts facts facts
He's already done more than that
You have no idea what you are doing and you're surrounding yourself with willfully ignorant people. Sad!
- really? he hasn't even entered office yet, and you're doubting him? give him a chance! everyone deserves @ least that.
This not the feedback we like to hear from our customer. We would hate 2 lose your as a customers. -NW
Hey there! How can we assist today? GL
It saddens us to see you leave our Sprint family. What can we do to regain your business? We would hate to lose you. CA
Not even president yet and you've already pissed off the country that makes all of your shit products. This a game to you? @realDonaldTrump
we hope you go up in flames #notmypresident @realDonaldTrump
then leave.
and your a brainless, toothless,moron who has yet to see the light or #darkcloud
stop being racist granny. Why do you have so much hate?
hard to not have hate when you've been molested and taken advantage of. And they put a pervert in the White House
sorry, the pervert would have been 'first rapist' Bill Clinton. Hey your facts straight. Trump did nothing to you crybaby.
why did you even bother to ask. When you knew you'd just be an ass?
Prez Obama builds relationship with Japan by meeting, Boo! #TRUMP takes credit 4 Japan investment Yay! #YouveBeenTrumped
@DonaldJTrumpJr 
So how is this ? You're going to cut off China but you'll open a door for Japan? Bad Muslims good Russian?
WRONG!
Does Japan know this or is it like the 'Mexico will pay for the wall' thing?
you da man
Congratulations ! ME/Felice.
What's in it for the Trumps?
Well done Mr. POTUS.  Just the start of big things to come.
You are crooked and a liar. The world is laughing at you. Resign now. #unfitforoffice #laughinstock
Now as a shareholder yourself, you know shareholders have a right to know where their money is being invested...
$$ behind Trump's tech deal from Saudi Arabiahttp://money.cnn.com/2016/12/07/technology/softbank-trump-saudi-arabia-fund/
@MamaMudaro it's good for the country. I hear leftists crying & saying all kinds of antiTrump bull shit.
When are they not?
So how much of the USA will Japan own. This is not you company it is #OurHone
Right that's all we need.  Another foreign bank owning a piece of America.  You call this progress? #sellout
If it comes to fruition I will be happy to give you due credit.  Promises can't be folded in your wallet.
Go ahead and sell more of America to Japan. Loser!
IT'S A LIE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A DEAL MADE MONTHS AGO
please put Newt in your cabinet he will be loyal and tell u the truth 
"The $50B investment would come from $100B  fund created by SoftBankSaudi government — Son saidas much to the WSJ oct 2016"
see your not staying in America.  Liar
Well, since they own Sprint they probably want their investment to do well.
QUIT lying, in the works months before you became POTUS. only your supporters believe you,not the over "2.5 million"
And why would they do that? What are you getting out of this Donnie? Something smells fishy. Believe it when see it.
Whoot Whoot!
THERE IT IS !!! MAKING DEALS, SELLING OUT BOEING JOBS AND SELLING YOU FOR LESS@ MITE AS WELL BE MADE IN JAPAN FOLKS
And all of the profit goes back to Japan you're a real genius aren't you (sarcasm)
Yeah you're selling yourself
this awesome!
That's old news. Stop taking credit for things you didn't achieve. #alwayslying
that was actually decided in October & it is part of a bigger deal & it involves $ from Saudi Arabia-forgot 2 mention that?

leaving out the fact it was already a multi country deal??
no stock market gambling for DJT, personally! Kudos Mr President!

awesome, how much did you make off that deal? Lifetime free Yakisoba?
Mr Trump I pray that your meeting with terrorist obama, you don't believe or respect anything he says? Along with Romney?
Way to go, Masa!
#Is there anything you WONT take credit for? Laughing picturing your base clapping at SAUDI money coming -OCTOBER planned!
So proud of you Mr. Trump. Keep up the great work
Please solve H1B, L1 visa abuse, EB1C green card fraud by staffing companies and Indian outsourcing companies, jobs for US.
that's amazing! Good job.. saw some of the previous responses, what an ignorant group that know nothing about #SoftBank
I wonder if that's the same investment they talked about 3 months ago. I might be mistaken, but Saudi Arabia gets a lot too
how could 50b only produce 50k jobs - is that just a number to build on? Either way, three birds one stone!
Not one on his, Masoyoshi's, website SoftBank. There is a webcast tho from today. Funny he mentions regret several times!
NOT good;
Can't wait to hear someone yell "Liar" during your first State of the Union. Since this has been deemed appropriate by GOP.
has in the high-tech economy, [Son] would have probably invested something in the neighborhood anyway."
We need the #fuelcell incentive tax credit to help expand fuel cell industry https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ab1feee4b0bef0179a1563/t/58407fd03e00befa6e934c05/1480622033250/FCHEA+Statement+Call+To+Action+MAS+FCHEA.pdf?platform=hootsuite … …
But actually this  http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/06/trump-says-softbank-will-invest-50-billion-in-the-us-aiming-to-create-50000-jobs.html …
line up for those $5/hr jobs.
You're #lying. Again. $50bil comes from previously announced $100bil intl investment fund.
PEOTUS you are amazing and I couldn't be prouder nor more grateful than I am for what you are doing for us. GBA, MAGA
GREAT JOB! YOU WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD!
liar!
My concern is when Foreign Investors buy into US Tech Startups, are they not getting a piece of the American Pie?
way to go Mr. President elect. Go President Trump.
thank you for cutting deals for America which is driving growth and spurs free markets!  got it media? @CNN @abc @CBSNews
Again, no matter how much positivity u bring & good work u do, people will ALWAYS criticize and never b satisfied.
tell Mrs DeVos to make "Animal Farm" and " Fahrenheit 451" required reading for all!
You are the Man Mr. President, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!
@USAforTrump2016
details please?  And how will you or your family benefit?
You said you would release your tax returns if elected.
Deal planned for months according to all reports not due to just you,,,,
like they just decided this? Deal has been in the works for a long time. What an idiot
this was announced on October 4th.  Nice try tho.  You had zero to do with it.
You just keep lying.   It's what you're best at.
interesting! This was announced in the anniversary of Pearl Harbor attack.
Wow! Amazing!
Don't take credit for something You had nothing to do with and now We will boycott anything to do with Softbank for lying
#pppanthersgov
the fund does not exist. If he gets the money it's over 10 years
understand how a business owner think and what attracts investments' interest! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
so, when are you bringing your manufacturing jobs back to the US? Afraid to pay a living wage to US workers?
They are all just brainwashed with hate.  God is with u you will prove it to the world they will thank u later.
What happens if we don't create jobs? Add 50 Million to the debt
Du bist naiv, Donald. Da krieg ich ja gleich nen Ständer.
I'm sure if you put a tax on cars coming from Japan they will reconsider.
Success/ Prosperity is the sweetest Revenge for anti trump liberals
I hope you prod #SoftBank enough to improve US coverage of Sprint as part of their investment deal!
Maybe those jobs will make up for all jobs lost at Boeing when you cancel A/F1 and cost them China orders
Good move putting the US even more in debt to other countries. Way to make America great, #SwampMonster.
@KenJone56612075 @realDonaldTrump then he'll default on them and put us at War
pics or it didn't happen @Trevornoah
.@realDonaldTrump so another bank in whose pocket you reside.
this is utter nonsense. Only a matter of time, before America finds out whose soul he sold for this farcical deal.
and what do they get in return?
can you comment on the fact that the money is coming from a trust in Saudi Arabia?
Just what we need. More of our country to be owned by Japan. Don't you get it yet? Everything isn't about money!!!
So you tweet about this before SoftBank (if it's true) makes an announcement to their investors
who's the guy that posted this?
My promises bind only the suckers who like to believe I've made them.
this is interesting. What were the terms of this deal? Transparency would help us see how future deals can be done.
... 1st world there, among those that are slowly withering away, with of course, exception of Israel.

What's your cut Donald?  LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON THE PRIZE! SHOW TAX RETURNS.  SET UP BLIND TRUST.
WHAT'S THE KICKBACK
at what cost to us?
thank you for helping American grow EP president Trump
thank you Mr. President!
Too bad this is a complete lie too, just like Carrier.  You are President Fugazi.
Why? Did you promise to do away with antitrust laws? NEVER FORGET YOU LOST THE POPULAR VOTE TO HRC! NO MANDATE!
#LittleBitchPresident TMOBILE/SPRINT MERGER INCOMING! FUCK THE AMERICAN CONSUMER
congratulations!!!!
.@realDonaldTrump Another lie.
More lies...this was a done deal before you even ran for election.
What's the timeline for these new jobs and when will you bring your companies back to the US?
masa-harina soft flour makes tortillas !
Sure they have
Yay!   SoftBanks rule.  HardBanks suck!   One billion for 1000 jobs.  Looks like wages are going up fast.  Thanks!
