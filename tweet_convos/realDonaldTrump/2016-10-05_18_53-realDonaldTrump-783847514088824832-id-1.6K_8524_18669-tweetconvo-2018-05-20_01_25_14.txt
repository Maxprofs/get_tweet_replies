you don't care that this man may not have payed federal income taxes in almost two decades? He's robbing the USA
No I don't care that Trump followed the law that Bill Clinton signed, I do care that Hillary broke the law over emails...
she didn't break the law. There was no law she broke.
It's against the law to have a secret server in your basement with classified material on it.
Sever wasn't secret, had 3 classified emails on it that were mislabeled by accident, still not illegal.
According 2 FBI director were hundreds. Watch his speech.Server was secret b/c department said they didnt give authorization
I've read the report. Only three emails had classification markers.
crushing you.
don't this so... Lol.  Trump is winning Florida.
not anymore..
... Is your graph the election?  No.... In other words there is more time so...
keep dreaming. BTW the electoral college doesn't have a football team..
Meaning?
he has no path to victory.
Sure about that?
you call that a big deal. This is a bigger deal @TheAtlantic endorsed @HillaryClinton , 3 time in their history. That's big
better than Trumps
what plan, you mean stump speech from the primaries
again what policy speeches, he has none
A subset of ICE endorsed you

Federal agencies do not make endorsements. Why do you lie and bend the truth as if we are all too stupid to notice ?
THE CLINTONS SPEAK OF HAVING GOOD FAMILY VALUES & OF BEING GOOD ROLE MODELS FOR CHILDREN...IS THIS A GOOD ROLE MODEL
Government groups can't and don't endorse a candidate. List the newspapers that have endorsed you. Go on. I'll wait.

Take care of the Americans sleeping in the streets first!!!  Close those immigration gates until our own are taken care of!
Hard for the gov't to take care of the homeless if greedy people like @realDonaldTrump are not paying taxes.
Absolutely!!The corruptGov't passed the laws that paved the way for the greedy rich to LEGALLY not pay taxes

I donot really agree with you neither understanding what you mean with that tweet
Even when you lie, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Trump for the Ovens 2016.
Bullshit! You lie so much you don't even know what the truth is anymore. Hint- you don't have a clue about anything
Government Agencies are not allowed to endorse political candidated.  Check yourself. You tried this already.
I was Wondering Why all The Living Democrat& Republican Former Presidents are all Supporting Hillary Clinton!
Probably the same reason NO newspaper has endorsed Trump. #Loser
u really are blonde, like HiLIARy! She'll never tax the 1%, they're supporting her. Get real 
.@realDonaldTrump 

ICE knows what is happening at the border. They bleed and die there to protect the nation.

President Trump will LEAD.
Actually, the border is managed by US Border Patrol and not by ICE.
And ICE, as a government agency, is not allowed to endorse political candidates.
ICE works w/Border Patrol & unions are allowed to endorse candidates, moron!

douche
When you have nothing of value to say, just call someone names. #MAHA
trump will be one of the best strong presidents we have had since reagen
Oh, yeah, Reagan and his trickle down bullshit. hows that working for you?
worked great better than our community leader done
My cat endorses you too! However it seems that he’s had a stroke as he often sits just staring at the wall for hours.
The same thing happened to Bernie
What am I supposed to do with this piece of information? I’m confused.
Put it in ur pipe and smoke it
And what does that accomplish? I don’t smoke a pipe. Again, I’m confused.
lol. Talking about your cat shows you are confused. Don't blame me for that.
You're the one who randomly Tweeted at me. So I'm supposed to vote Trump because Bernie had a stroke, smoke it & then my cat?
Vote for whoever. I saw ur cat stroke comment, &busted ur balls. keep it going or have a nice day. I don't care
..very impressive, must follow thru now & make endorsement count - emphasize in debate!
you misread that too. They endorsed to DEPORT you.
Are you really from official team of trump?
crap! sleazy hawker keepin' it all for yourself! hasn't any relation to official campaign!
USA Today did too, and it wasn't you.  Also, Arizona Republic, Cincinnati Enquirer, and on and on and on...

that's the Union members NOT the Dept! What a LIAR! #TrumpLies #TrumpIsALoser
by law they are not permitted to take/make any partisan political endorsement next lie #DontheConTrump

@realdonaldtrump
For the third time since The Atlantic’s founding, the editors endorse a candidate for president.  http://theatln.tc/2duTzmb  
I bet the biased media won't report this.

POLITICIANS SOUND GOOD TRUMP DOES GOOD {PROOF}.
Not the agency itself. Only some of its employees. Whoop-dee-doo.
<3 Drac
#NeverEverTrump
A union of those workers endorsed you, not the government agency. Your supporters may not read past the headlines but we do
There were a lot of firsts for Hillary but the list is too long for tweeting
. @realDonaldTrump It's the union, not the actual service nor representative of all the officers. But you knew that....
It's the union, not U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Secure our border, language, culture.Stop the flow of terrorists and illegals into our beloved country. America 1st, 2d, 3d
we love Trump.
