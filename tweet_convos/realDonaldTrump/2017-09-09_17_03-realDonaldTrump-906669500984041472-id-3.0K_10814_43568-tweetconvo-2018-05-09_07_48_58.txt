 "Trusting God." A Vero
Beach resident discusses
decision not to #Evacuate
ahead of #HurricaneIrma 

If you are a sexual offender
or have a warrant and seek
shelter from #Irma in Polk
County  you'll be placed…

Our whole life we were taught to not have babies unless we can afford them,meanwhile we pay for our replacements

And you opened Mar-a-lago to seniors in harms way, correct?

No.

Of course not.

That would imply you had a soul.
Sadly the shelters have been turning people away since yesterday. But you knew that.
I assume u R providing more than a regurgitated tweet (shelter at Mar a Lago OF COURSE) 4 state u unnecessarily inconvenience w/ traffic!!!
Many people are saying that #MaraLago @MarALago should be opened as a shelter for victims of #Irma
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd, his skin was orange and his hair was odd.

If you are seeking shelter, you can use the @Waze app to find and navigate to them. Type help in the search box. #HurricaneIrma
Why don't you open Mar-a-Lago for a safe place to shelter?
Terrible communicator.  That was the worst public announcement.  I feel dumber for having listened to it. Made zero sense.
how about Mar-a-Lago as a rescue relief center? What do you say to this BLOWTUS?

Too bad you didn't go to Mar-a-Lago this weekend.

When Harvey hit Texas, the President of Mexico offered help and support. A huge earthquake hits Mexico and our terrible President is silent
Because "@potus" @realDonaldTrump has no worthwhile advice and never will have!
#weakTrump #failingTrump #loserTrump
Florida governors are why we had Dubya in office. Do not listen to him, it is a trap.
Finally give credit to truth.
This is not Irma storm this is America distorting Riqa Syria and Musial Iraq .
People can't get to shelters  in Central Florida who worked for Disney. Nor do they have water since their shifts were extended
Heed the advice of climate scientists & take #GlobalWarming seriously. #Irma #Harvey #Jose #HurricaneIrma #HurricaneHarvey #HurricaneJose
I know for a fact that two of the shelters are turning people away. Have you checked on these places to see what capacity they're at? Full!
A pro active president rolling up his sleeves & tackling crisis in real time instead of hiding/evading/avoiding & passing the buck
Hey Don would your hair stay on during a hurricane?
THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT FOR ALL YOU DO
Hey, just want to congratulate you on not saying anything utterly ridiculous, racist, or anti-science for the last 24 hours. New record! 
Isn't @FLGovScott the guy in charge one of the largest Medicare fraud scams in US history?
Stay safe Thomas 
I am with the dreamers 
We r weather is bad heavy winds and lost power .
Stay safe 
I'm still here but no power so I'm making best
God is punishing USA for electing Trump.
Nice grammar.
That is Trump University for you, Sarah. lol
Global warming. Still think it's a myth?
We wouldn't need evacuations if climate change didn't create such a monster hurricane Stop making environmental decisions based on investors
Yes, shelter.... head to Mar-A-Lago for that.  Trump is very concerned about your safety!  Oh.... wait.
If you're a climate denier - you shouldn't govern. Coastal cities. Blind governor ignores climate change. #FakePresident #climatechange
He has been great for Florida.  Thank you Rick Scott!
You are doing a GREAT JOB!!! Cutting red tape to get Fuel, people and supplies to FL!! Thank you !!! Preside working well with everyone!!

Can we use Maralago as a shelter?
With all those families trying to evacuate you almost want to tell them to hunker down but yet their shelter will be destroyed #FreakingOut
Shelters are filling up these poor peeps are stuck in traffic and in long lines this is SO FREAKIN SCARY I pray for everyone Irma will hit..
Mr President, lead your people to a national repentance. This storm was prophesied in July by #ProphetDrOwour #PrepareTheWay
If only they could!!
Then do the right thing & open up ur precious mar a lago, since our taxpayer money goes into it! Ur a fraud!
If you hadn't lied so many times your words would have meaning.
Now it's just empty.
You had a choice , you chose lies and deception.

You giving homeowners federal insurance too?
Maybe he'll pay out of pocket. After he donates that $1M to Harvey victims.
Right. Because when the name Trump comes up -giving-is the first word that comes to mind. He's on vacation now. Such a hard life
Arpaio believes Trump is giving. Corporations. Swamp monsters. In real life? No
Trump exploits everything and everyone and would offer Arpaio as a sacrificial lamb to save his own butt in a heartbeat.
I see the pardon is being questioned. Unconstitutional. I doubt it goes far. Sessions & DOJ are sycophants. Not there to support the law
Stop telling us to heed. Find a new word or just make one up.

Scott can't form sentences... just like you
#voicejanice
plz my president their killing the Christians in Nigerian.the Muslim are killing them.reasons because the Christians are
And Donald trump look at Jacob wahl he blocked me on twitter becuse of you does he know how Steve bannon feels about James comey ha ha ha

They aren't white Europeans, they qualify 4 affirmative action
DACA makes new class of people, beating our kids not on merit but 'diversity'
But are you opening @MarALago to refugees????
#Irma2017 #MaraLago told I'd see you again

Just let #presidentkelly do his job and shut up, things are going well since he took over #25for45
I wish the President a happy life, the whole family happy, you unite and defeat the hurricane, God bless the United States
too bad you've blocked a lot of citizens from seeing these warnings. You're dangerous.
looks like the worst is over , Irma is threading the needle , not Great , but a mighty salvation from God
Gov Scott showing more leadership than you.
How about making the Mar a Lago fortress as you describe it available for shelter? We already paid a fortune into it.
#Bannon2024

Love our President, more every day!
Hey @realDonaldTrump RESIGN you're embarrassing yourself
Climate change is real! Ask Harvey, Irma or Jose! Standing with FL! @EPAScottPruitt #ParisAgreement @UNFCCC @SenSanders @algore
Kudos to @potus @FLGovScott for Irma preparedness from this Sarasota resident.
Also Gov Scott and Donald Trump: "Climate change is a hoax".
Mr. President please express your vote to name the very movement you started. Please go to my profile and participate/promote (retweet) 
Governor Scott has set the standard with his leadership on Irma. Thank you Governor.
The Dems will win if none of Trump's big agenda get passed. TIME IS SHORT. REPUBLICANS ARE MAD. UNITING NEEDED FAST.
SHUT UP! You have nothing cogent to offer The People except social media platitudes!
Be strong...@ http://kiliedutravel.com 
ICYMI Climate change.
Does Gov Scott ever sleep?
Heed the advice of the majority of Americans and resign
For every one of you Trump haters there are 1000 TRUMP  lovers we outnumber your votes by 1000 - 1 your votes are basically non-existent.
Sadly the anti-trump haters eagerly wait for EVERY Trump tweet to spread their vomit. Get a life!!!
We're hunkered down!!!!
I moved from Florida to Arkansas, but I voted for GovScott, he is a genuine person, If he says he'll do something it's done!
WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING ALL OF THE DEEP STATE CROOKS ? HILLARY COMEY LYNCH ??
Climate change is real and if you don't heed the warnings of scientists world wide. If you can't do that you'll destroy futures & lives.
Do you believe in climate change yet? Think of the food sources being destroyed right now. Why take the chance of destroying our planet?
"And make sure all your horcruxes are safe and well-hidden"
Got a feeling it's too late to go anywhere; hunker down where you are & just Pray!
Heed the advice of scientists, take climate change seriously ffs. We must make radical changes immediately to mitigate the worst effects.
enormous destructive power - Irma is dangerous also
Pray for our hospital staff that have to stay ! Job requires it!
Governor Scott is a great leader.
Thanks for your support & concern during hurricane Irma.
If you're in the path of Irma, evacuate yesterday or last week.
There are many Americans stranded in Turks and Caicos and surrounding islands. Please help us. Please don't forget about us. Thanks
Ty for doing the difficult job of being President when so many complain! Ignore them and keep doing YOU!
The shelters are full my relatives have no where to go lost power in the afternoon around 3 pm been without power all night it's getting bad
Yes  amen
#RickScott banned #climatechange from being discussed by #Florida state employees. #ClimateChangeIsReal #ScienceBitches
Yeah no shit Sherlock

I had hoped with @jeffsessions the law & justice will be restored in America.
So far, VERY disappointed
How could DOJ let Lois Lerner free 

It's unbelievable that Trump appointees at State/DOJ are opposing JW's efforts to expose truth on #Clinton scandals.

Maybe he's the one who needs to tell you to LEAVE!

Heed the advise of the majority of Americans … resign. Before We The People , impeach and prosecute you.
Best POTUS ever. Obama went golfing. Shame to those who criticize & moralize against you! Hypocrites under Satan's delusion.
I assume Mar a Lago was opened as a shelter??
I heard it's a great day for golf at Mar-A-Lago!
Send them to Mar a Lago for shelter. Aren't you ( supposedly) a man of God??!! 
You failed Hugely Bigly West Coast Floridians and risked their lives! @realDonaldTrump your 7/24 means Zero. @CNN
And listen to all the updates on CNN. They will keep you safe.
Any changes on thoughts about climate change, Donald? Surely you've got to be wondering...
Can't believe fake news blame the commander for the storm and some illegals not going to shelter because of some chance of getting deported
Gov Scott has been amazing!!
You must not be golfing then since a handful of "your" courses may be hit by #HurricaneIrma?
Nasty, nasty!
Mr President I know you have a lot on your plate nut Justice MUST be served.http://amp.dailycaller.com/2017/09/08/trumps-justice-department-lets-lois-lerner-off-the-hook/ …
