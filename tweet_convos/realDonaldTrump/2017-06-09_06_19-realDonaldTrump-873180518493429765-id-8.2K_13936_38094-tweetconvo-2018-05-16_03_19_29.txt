Your Harvard colleague Laurence Tribe said u, "couldn't possibly be more wrong," and that you've "forgotten basic principles of const. law."
Oh, but he did. Very disturbing to see the manner in which the highest office is conducting businesses. Another sad moment in our nation.
Tell The Truth!
Political sins? I love the Repubs' defense: Trump is too stupid to know better.

You're long past your prime bruh
Putin on Fox News with Hannity waiting to be tagged in and they'd say, no smoking gun.  In that case they'd be right. No "guns" there
We should never stop talking about obstruction of justice.
Another MAN who believes in DEMOCRACY..... *

There, fixed it for you.
Or another man who is rational.
Whatever. You lie all the time.
DESPERATION!
so...what's your connection to trump Alan. You defend him a lot and really say nothing constructive or helpful I don't get why
How did Comey have memo? Did he email to himself to private account? Is that why he never charged Hillary?
This CAN'T be a serious question. Please, for the sake of humanity, tell me this is an attempt at a joke.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider TRUMP 2020
Haha 
Not going to happen!
Lol you seriously retweeted this?
They should fix the healthcare system... it's violating human rights, just like the justice system does. #libertymatters
THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS COMING FROM THE DEMOCRATS! ALL THEY THINK IS RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA! WASTE OF TAX DOLLARS!
Trump is the biggest waste of tax dollars !!
1) donates his salary to charity

2) he owns the golf courses so      he doesn't have to pay

3) democrats aren't too smart
4. Dosen't release taxes
5. Owes Millions to Russia
6. Ban a whole religion from flying here
7. Lies about EVERYTHING
8. ProRussia cabinet
There is no rule saying he has to release taxes you after yesterday still believe in collusion with Russia? Did you watch the hearing?
The libs only hear and see what they want.
They are not living in reality they are not normal I'm not sure they're people
They are definitely some kind of stupid.
Didn't you work for OJ's defense?
Let's hear the supposed tapes, then we'll know who is telling the truth.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider Alan Dershowitz is your Mar-a-Lago buddy. He's biased.
No. We shouldn't.
It's Time we investigate the Attorney General Loretta Lynch squeezy Matter
We know it's not criminal, it's Impeachable
Alan Dershowitz's literal forte is to help guilty people get out on a technicality. He is also a racist! You two are a match made in heaven.
Please remember:
Say it with me: THE FACT THAT SOMEONE IS A HARVARD PROFESSOR DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE NEVER WRONG!
Doesn't that include Ohbama?

I'm sure his time is coming. He got out just in time to not be president when it happens!
You just keep holding on to that little dream.
It's nice to dream...
You keep dreaming while Trump keeps winning! 
I hope those alleged tapes being subpoenaed and/or being proven not to exist. Either way, the liar Trump will be further exposed. #LockhimUp
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider You should just stop talking, you stretch the law like Chris Christie in size small yoga pants.

First OJ, now Trump?
The biggest Fake news group in America Fake [Fox] news
This is a bad take.
As a country we should move on and put this behind us and learn from it, we stand W/POTUS to MAGA
Right.
Lies. Falsehoods. What we really need to stop doing is attempting to silence thruth and having cherry picked facts.
you'll Never convince die hard liberal leftists, even with Facts. They r stuck in their fantasies and will always remain in their bubble 
Feel free to give me facts.. not the alternative facts but you know, the real ones.
Facts: NO evidence of #POTUS collusion with Russia. Never has been personal investigation into #POTUS. Lynch colluded with comey,comey LIED!
To separate the Clinton investigation from the justice department to keep it fair and uninfluenced. Sooooo umm... I think the thing is 4/
so why did comey testify he felt something wrong with lynch, yet STILL claimed a "matter" instead of investigation? and DID nothing about it
He didn't have the choice of what to call the HRC investigation if Lynch, his superior, told him to call it a matter. Do I think that
You also helped a murderer go free -remember OJ Simpson!
Remember the American justice system? Innocent until proven guilty?
That only works for the left apparently if you are RIGHT you are guilty no matter whether you are actually investigated
To Dems Reps guilty 1st/proof made up later. An innocent Rep beat rap, lied, paid off, whatever...
It really doesn't matter Dipshitowitz. Just the beginning of charges coming against #CrookedTrump & his cronies!
Get Comey's FBI laptop.
Unfortunately, modern politics is defined by investigating imaginary crimes, then manufacturing a charge of obstructing the investigation.

DonTheCon. Shut the fuck up. You're a disgrace and the majority of Americans don't buy your bullshit. Can't wait to watch this trigger you.
RodTheNimRod..... U tired of losing yet ?
#TrumpTrain
Lol. Let me check with you to find out what losing feels like. Burn! Sick burn. Lol.
You sound pathetic
RT @AlanDersh: We should stop talking about obstruction of justice. No plausible case. We must distinguish crimes from p...
Ummm.... Obstruction of justice is a crime.
Umm, no.. no obstruction involved sweetheart... move on..
Umm, no dearie. It really looks a whole lot like obstruction, hun.
Looks doesn't count for anything. Wishing it does not make it so.
Wishing likewise does not make obstruction go away...
I could care less.. I did not vote Trump.. this obstruction of justice crap is a bit much.. wreaks of desperation
Demanding the laws of the land be upheld reeks (not wreaks) of patriotism, not of being desperate.
Desperate is spewing lies to CYA
Please help our President Elect.  Our way of life is going down the tube and how can we put a stop to this.  Our whole system is being undermined by corrupt people and organizations.  The media is not exposing what is going on. We need people like you to save our way of life.
It is possible to be both a pol sin and crime. Same is true for a pardon, which can be a crime, say if it was given for a bribe.
Alan
SHAME ON YOU
How is that trial of your friend, the child predator, going?
Would you just go away? You're soooooo tiresome.
The evidence of "obstruction" already exists, but why don't you offer your services to Trump so that you can both find that your legal views are incorrect. Trump will then be able to "credit" you and your advice for his impeachment and imprisonment. He needs a scapegoat !!!
Wondering why the champion of OJ and Trump didn't tweet out some kind words for Manson upon his passing...
Oh Alan, you keep dreaming. Denial doesn't mean not guilty.
.@realDonaldTrump-AGREE abt talk-let Mueller work. BUT clear AID to PUTIN to BREAK UP free West & Amer instit's -SOMETHING being COVERED-UP!
Oh, sure, because yours is the only opinion that counts and it would be bad for you if Trump were impeached eh?
#ImpeachTrump
How does Alan D see 'no plausible case' when perjury and meaningless words are standard?; separating crimes from pol sins will be hard too.
 Trump who is Trump ?
Thankfully nothing has to be run by you before it can go forward.
So it's ok for the prez to commit multiple "political sins" in 4 months? Any one else get that latitude at work? No!! #WorstPresidentEver
Insider 'Fox News' says it all
Why do you continue to defend the indefensible?
Trying to stop a criminal investigation is a crime. Political sin is you defending Trump's obstruction of justice as politics.
@realDonaldTrump @rushlimbaugh @seanhannity @LouDobbs Case is closed ! Time for the snowflakes 2 shut up & Congress to get 2 work and #MAGA!

What's really surprising is what the Democrats are claiming Dershowitz actually said! Really unbelievable!!!
We will not and won't stop it. There is a sealed indictment. There is an ongoing criminal investigation. You cannot stop it.
Since ur not privy to all info gathered by the investigators, u really shouldn't make such unqualified declaratives. U know better.
@JamesComeyFBI pathetic, disgusting, crooked, civil servant that should be thrown in JAIL FOR TREASON, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, RACKETEERING!
Quack attorney talking about quack Predisent. 
#TrumpRussia #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCollusion #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #LIAR #ObstructionOfJustice #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow
Doesn't Trump's retweet of this amount to an admission of committing a political sin?
Asking the acting director of the FBI to drop an investigation, is obstructing. In its purest form.
Thank you.. amen
Trump Ass kisser.Shut up Alan
Acussed Faults are not crimes.
No lie Dr. however *that is part of the Collective Fog .. unwilling or unable to Distinguish or Reason w their *own God given brains
Sir, please answer for me because I don't know. Who can initiate the investigations and then indict ALL those??

Comey is the Leaker! Arrest his ass @realDonaldTrump #cnn #FoxNews 
You helped OJ Simpson, a murdering thug  go free, and now you are giving cover to a lying bully who hates Obama more than he loves America.
sin meaning mistake, in Trump's case I would argue he just doesn't regard the status quo, not really a mistake
A voice of reason.
The fake Media & the Democrats wont stop talking about Russian spying......We are so sick & tired of hearing it in the news. Enough Already.
Donald Trump... You're the POTUS for ALL Americans... Insulting Democrats/potential votes is not very smart!!!
You are so right Mr. President. The Left is just like a NASCAR race, going round in circles. And I love NASCAR! Left has nothing left
Obviously the law means nothing in this country anymore.  Political hacks have taken over the judiciary and government
Alan Derpowitz is a possible pedophile, and doesn't have much knowledge of the law apparently. He should be disregarded.
Of ALL the brilliant legal minds NONE of them agree with Alan.  LOL POST THOSE DRUMPH.
U took what he said out of context as usual. This is not his whole view point on this matter of the Russians, other dots they are connecting
"to spur special counsel," headed by Comey's buddy and a bunch of Democrats.  Fixed, much?  Disgusting.
Yes!
Stop with the obstruction thing.
He's obviously hiding something bigger.
Investigate #TrumpRussia
#NulifyElection #NewElection #Resist
I'm still waiting for all the left's heroes and icons to move to Canada or better yet to Syria, they could help refugees
You all totally wrong!
You are, at best, intellectually dishonest and at worst, completely destroying any credibility you had. My 6 yr old could prove obstruction!
Let's see what Mueller has to say and let's let the courts decide. You believe in the constitution, right Mr Trump.
People might have paid more attention to your 'input' if you didn't just go have buddy time at Mar-a-lago!!!
If even half of what Comey said is hard fact, I'd take that to court in a second and even go up against you!!
We should never stop talking about it. It needs to be resolved one way or the other but kindly stop singing "lalala" to make it go away
Pardon Comey if he is charged and move on with the important "matters" of running the government. Taxes, healthcare, jobs, infrastructure.
too bad you have no idea of the difference, either.
Hush now.
You are truly ridiculous, everytime we see u on some news channel u make no sense....u just say a bunch of words that make random sentences.
#dershisadouche  is a sellout and always has been...from OJ to Donald J.  He is the not a friend to our Republic. He is an enemy of peace
Bullshit.
Dershowitz, take a number, sit down , and shut up.

@SenFeinstein No, obstuction of Justice. It is time to give it UP! Americans want the Senate to start WORKING and skip the summer BREAK....
@realDonaldTrump  oh boy...we see you...we ALL see you. Impeach!
I love reading the liberal trolls shit themselves trying to squeeze a life time of hate in 140 characters with these type of posts. 

Alan needs to review USA vs. Nixon from SCOTUS. He's getting forgetful in his age.
Didn't you defend OJ? You're judgement and opinion is irrelevant
@FoxNews IS FAKE, AND THE WEASELS WHO WORK FOR THEM ARE RETARDS!
Asking us to "stop talking about it" means we are on the exact right track. Thanks!!
Let's see who would I trust my faithful wife of 50yrs or the whore that just showed in the city corner . If do not know a while check track
The TAX and SPEND Democrats are the biggest waste of money. Come into office a nickel and dimer then leave a Multi Millionaire. Off R taxes
@POTUS you have to have a very high I.q.

I know.
you two should team up, it would make for great theater...
You obstructed justice. If an opponent did that you'd be shrieking non stop on Fox and Fiends.  #CrookedDonnie
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider so Mr. Trump - you are admitting the commission of "political" sins?
sorry way too many lawyers in D.C. & America disagree with you.
You got OJ off;you're defending these criminals.Let reason prevail. You are a smart person, which makes me wonder-why are  you a republican?
Sounds like you and trump might be hiding something.
1861-1865 Civil War
2016-2020 US Media War
Patriots MUST STOP Media Elite's Globalist Agenda
&
END Leftist Media BIAS FOR GOOD.
FIGHT & RT!
Comey should be the one for obstruction of justice by giving his friend confidential information.
In teaching they tell us this type of thing is called 'negative attention' because some people can't seem to find the positive kind.
This just in: President is above the laws in place! TIL we DO have a dictator rather than a president under checks and balances.
Except, it seems Mueller disagrees.
This case is based on Russia hacks, the investigation is young ''discovery'' that means ALL witnesses, paper trail, financial trail
We should stop listening to you and follow Supreme Court precedents
Traitor.

FOX NEWS is as FAKE as any other network.No better than any other news reporting network, just pro DJT all the way! DERSH,DJT a criminal!
How about asking the Clinton's with Obamas help, about the Uranium sale to the Russians
MAYBE YOU SHLD DEFEND TRUMP THEN. I HEAR HE NEEDS A GOOD ATTORNEY. #RESIST45 #IMPEACH45 #ObstructionOfJustice #LiarInChief #magafail
You have no idea what is going on in the investigation. No idea.  Calling all of this "political"  makes you sound like you have an agenda.
Get to know this guy.
Go get'em Alan. Only smart one of the bunch.
DERSHOWITZ NAILED IT!  Now let HIM and others do ALL the TALKING!  YOU concentrate on MORE important things!
Of course one of OJ's and Claus von   Bülow's attorneys is your go-to for assessing your case. #ImpeachTrumpNOW #ImpeachTrump #PutinsPuppet
Oh there's more than enough there you apologist.
#ImpeachTrumpNOW
The president does not have unlimited powers.
1st off, Alan, u just want 15 min of fame since OJ, @realDonaldTrump is guilty & most law scholars agree, so go back and read your law books
We should STOP talking about ALL of this!  This is ALL a "witch hunt"! #FireMuellerNow
Who cares about obstruction...... People should care about collusion and treason.....
Trump was set up by @FBI Comey. Mueller MUST RECUSE himself as they were likely in it together! #DrainTheSwamp
@POTUS you'll never have this title "immaculate conception.."

Dirty judge covered rape & fraud by lies fake news my trial

Its ok God will
Alan, I see you have enjoyed ur "special" time w Boris's young ladies of the night.   Classy bud
It's a planned effort to obstruct our @POTUS agenda and the people's business, plain and simple. Stop the foolishness!
used to admire Dersh, but can no longer do that since he decided 2 "pimp" himself in hopes of landing position as defense attorney for POTUS
No case on CLINTON plenty yo go around on Trump
How low can you sink? You are long past needing the attention unless, of course, you too suffer from the same narcissism as 45.
Didn't he help O.J. get off?
Please answer to HELP WANTED ad and clean up this mess! Go Alan!
He admitted why he fired Comey. Are you not listening or are you on payroll?
And double standards. Political sins only if there's an R next to the name.
Typical Republicunt response: "Nuh uhhh..you are!!" 
Stop deflecting and address the issue at hand. You're against the ropes and desperate
you, sir, are a shonde
Comey didn't leak a memo. It is his memo and he put it out there for a reason. There is no leak except that which Trump leaks!
I wouldn't advise hooking your horses to the Dershowitz wagon.
