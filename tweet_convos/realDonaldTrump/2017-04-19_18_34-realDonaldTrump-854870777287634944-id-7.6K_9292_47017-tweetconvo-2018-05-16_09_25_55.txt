How about some clean water & in tact mountains for Appalachia? You are a "business" man. You can formulate clean energy.
Do you believe you deserved the honour?
Half the team didn't show up because YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT YOU POS!
I am SO HAPPY THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT CARES ABOUT THE USA. GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP!  Linda Theis
And half of them can't stand you.
Tell the truth.
Proud of our NE Patriots and proud of all players but especially those who chose not to attend. President @POTUS44 us to be celebrated.

 really only few of them take look the pictures Obama 2016 and from you 2017
Continue doing your job Mr. President, I commend you! And thank you for supporting law enforcement!
I wouldn't have gone
Yeah, they look thrilled to be there.
and most of them didnt show up. hey, did you get a #45 jersey?  no? wow, they gave Obama a #44 jersey.  wow they must have forgot.
Too bad so many members refused to go, including your 'good friend' Tom Brady (Go Blue!) #HitlerTrump is a failure!  Worst 100 days EVER!!!!

Where's Brady's. Guess you're not really friends at all
Half of them kept away

Put down your I phone and try to do the job. Between golf, twittering and tv you do nothing!
nobody Like You DJT
No one gives a care,Donny. Get a few to show up, though.
Some Pats. Others, w/ a conscience, a sense of right & wrong, stayed home. Imagine, world champs turning down chance to see POTUS & WH

Go Patriots!!
Typical diversion tactics will not fool anyone with an ounce of awareness 
@TiffanyATrump Tiffany Trump se mi esposa soy lo sufisiente para Tiffany Trump
Lmmfao where is the team? More showed up for Obama with no excuses.
Good for Obama...that's his only legacy
At least he has some...you don't
why such a small turnout Donnie Boy?
to host half of them ya mean lol
Such a small turnout, smallest ever
A few missing faces?
No one likes you, and you've had to buy friends and wives
How do you feel, most of those people think you're stupid and bought?
A fine collection of cheaters.
To be proud of one's own in today's world of so called political correctness is an honest virtue.
WAR
You can see in this video you posted that only half the team showed up #failingdonaldtrump
Bravo "real" patriots that stayed home.
Big deal. Where are all the athletes? They didn't show up!
Nobody signed the helmet! Wow!
It was a football game, can we stop this nonsense tradition?  Has nothing to do with anything and is just a 'look at us' event... #Boring
Yeah half of them lol SAD not even the president could get them all out  lol OOPS OBAMA DID LOL
Hmmmm, I think you're missing a player or two..... #failure #winning?
but no Tom Brady - hmmm
Your such a little man Don the con! Obama was a real president! Eight players did not attend because of you and your policies! Your a joke
Honor? You have no honor!
Finally! Some winners in the White House! #10Promises10Fails
You always sucked at football Donny
You didn't serve during Vietnam and now you have no qualms about sending troops in harms way. Shameful. You had an 8 year old girl killed.

No signatures, they didn't want to admit they were there. 
When Obama was POTUS he had twice as many Patriots at the WH.  Just like the inauguration. It's because people hate you.  We miss Obama.
have to pay a crowd to come and clap? SAD! Twice as many players came to Obama's White House! SAD!
Size matters....and the number of players who did NOT attend because of YOU was an all time high.
When you work against Americans, you alienate patriots.
Fake media I removed it.

An NFL Champ Just Wrote Pres.Obama A Heartfelt Note After Visiting Trump at WH http://occupydemocrats.com/2017/04/21/nfl-champ-just-wrote-obama-heartfelt-note-visiting-trump-white-house/ …

…
that was the worst PR exercise in history for #Patriots being photographed with #Traitor #TrumPutin
How about you hire American first, and actually pay workers.
look how many didn't show up!!!
A president who cheated his way to office honoring a team that cheated to win a Super Bowl.  How pathetic. Trump and Pats deserve each other
too bad almost half the team didn't show up
I'm positive the great NE Patriot team will remember meeting you Mr President, in your first year & also first sports champ to be at the WH.
Smaller crowd just like your inauguration
the greatest Super Bowl win of my time and many others!
didn't they cheat to win one of those rings?
Patriots suck. Only bigger baby than you is whiny Tom Brady. Go suck his thumb
A great honor to host the @SuperBowl Champion New England @Patriots at the White House

Liar
What a dismal showing.
That doesn't look like the whole team, for some reason.
Of all the important relevant thing's you could be doing, and your inviting a stupid football team to the white house?
The camera doesn't lie, there were less than half of the Pats roster there! Delusional POTUS.
Too bad half of them didnt show up. Loser!!
Give'em hell Mr.President ,much love from Oklahoma City 
Where was Tom?
Did anyone sign your helmet because the one I saw had no signatures on it.
That wasn't the whole team
Small crowd compared to last year. SAD
You met with a cheating coach! The cheating quarterback did not show up, you (a cheater) met with a cheater just like you. No one cares.
Must have been too busy at the GOLF COURSE, sooooooo might as well do this......
on the BEST pain killers money can buy....
To bad most of them blew you off and no one signed your helmet
I think none of them should have gone
But then again they are the patriots 
Can never get away from deflate gate
- have a backbone
Meh...Obama's was better
Patriots are great & took on the NYTimes for their as usual disgraceful use of the media for their own agenda. Hooray Patriots & President
Half of the team didn't show up. Nobody likes you. #wakeup #Impeach45 #wheresobama

Great to see all the players didn't show up.
Too bad so many didn't want to be there!!
You should have used a smaller room because it would have made the crowd look larger POTUS OBAMA HAD A WAY LARGER CROWD 
Or at least the ones that bothered to show up...
Giselle slammed you!
Oops. They forgot to sign your helmet. Maybe you can borrow President Obama's for photo ops.
Except your boyfriend Tom Brady sold you out. HAHA!
'  But, but, but. . . your helmet was not signed.
@realDonaldTrump where's Tom Brady?
helmet without any autographs. Very telling!
#Well done All You good people. So so lucky to have a President, like the one You do. 
God Bless The #USA
You should follow in Aaron Hernandez's footsteps. The world will thank you for it.
Where's was the QB
