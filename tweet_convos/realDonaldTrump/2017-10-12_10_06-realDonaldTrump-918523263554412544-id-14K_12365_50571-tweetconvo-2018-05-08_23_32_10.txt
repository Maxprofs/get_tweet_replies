Your EO does none of that
I don't always agree with Senator Paul but he has done a great job on this EO. THANK YOU

Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh
How many Americans did you kill today, with the stroke of a pen? Sleep well, do you?
Kkkkkkkkkk Hummmmmm

RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @RandPaul YOU need to apply the Price Gouging Laws to the big Healthcare Insur Cos Premiums & Deductibles. #USA
Yes you’re right it’s time WE THE PEOPLE are granted the same healthcare we pay for you and other government officials!
Cutting ACA subsidies is a psychopathic attack on the most vulnerable people in our country! #MURDERER
Remove the mandate. It is unconstitutional!
Here: have a Snickers. You're too much like a Dictator when you're hungry.
Thanks for giving Democrats the best shot at taking over majorities in the House and Senate in 2018! Destroying health care, what a hero.
No one is above the law! @GOP @SenateGOP @VP @jeffsessions 
RUSSIAN SANCTIONS NOW!!!
Hypocrite in Chief!
Love this!
Way to go @CNN!  More news outlets need to do the same!
You just increase everyone's cost. Good luck getting re elected.
Competition does not guarantee lower costs. Do people seriously not remember unaffordable healthcare for pre existing conditions before ACA!
Best news ever for Health insurance.  After several of your predecessors considered this you finally are pushing through! #abouttime

I hope nobody is buying this BS! You have zero understanding of how ins. works & what has & hasn't been done, failed or why. Time for u 2 go
.@realdonaldtrump I'm confused. You said I'd have BETTER health coverage but what you're doing may leave me completely uninsured. WTF?!
I just lost my grant to pay health insurance. Premium from the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.....they're out of money. I have multiple myeloma.
Sorry to hear that.  People living with cancer should not worry about that.  We have enough on our plate.
Excluding older people.  Healthcare for older workers, seniors will be unattainable. Employers will purge older workers to save $$$. Shame
You will do anything you can to take away healthcare from millions of Americans. It is disgraceful. History will not be kind to you.
Dear Mr. President. 2grown kids w/serious pre-existing cond.,can’t work/we carry them. They’ll end up on the street /no ins. If no subsidy.
His Time Is Coming..Hes A Evil Low Down Bum
Thank you Mr President!! Finally competition to drive down costs and raise benefits!! Waiting long for this!!

There is no suck thing as free market in healthcare!  In your version Lower cost = less people covered AND higher copays for the rest!
The time has come to take anchovies to IMPROVE pizza, INCREASE yummy, and LOWER COSTS for HEATH BARS!
Who the hell quotes THEMSELVES?!
Need tax policy-means-tested federal deposits into robust HSAs  purchasing catastrophic insurance across state lines, routine & Direct care
Trying your best to undo Obama's accomplishments. That will NEVER happen. Obama is everything a president should be. You? Not so much!
RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @RandPaul YOU need to apply Price/Cost Controls on Premiums & Deductibles + Regulate Healthcare Insur Cos. #USA

RT @SenateGOP @HouseGOP #Trump & #Paul plan screws over all people with preexisting conditions. #USA #Americans #ACA #Healthcare @GOP #AHCA
Been preaching this on your Facebook from the beginning: Congrats for taking steps to put a stop to ins & govt. extortion!#jameswoods
We get that you are jealous of Obama.  Thanks for reminding us daily that you are not close to being the man he is.
The time has come to rig the market in favor of the rich, and fuck over everybody else by chaotically removing subsidies from the market.
Please donnie help America eat a bucket of chicken fries and a few doublecheese burgers daily and have that massive fatale heart attack
More access and skyrocketing pricing that no one can afford that is much worse than ACA.  You are so wrong, and such a loser. Terrible
You will now be responsible for people losing coverage and possibly having to make heart wrenching decisions regarding care.
Yet you just RAISED premiums by EO. What is wrong with you! The ONLY good, is backlash you'll receive for raising our premiums! #Dotard
You're going to KILL people. Will you get a twisted delight in doing so?
You literally condemned people - Americans - to death today. #25thAmmendment
How in the hell are you going to lower costs by increasing premiums? Dotard.
VP is going to inherit a helluva ACA mess after what #IMPOTUS did today. That's great. America will hate VP when they lose their healthcare.
Sone people feel Obama care is good because that's the only healthy insurance they've had. But their actually not rece'ing the Best of care
you mean Ins they couldnt use its great to have a card that u cant USE
You know you OWN THIS now right? NO LONGER OBAMACARE. Its now #Trumpcare , since you signed the E.O. THIS will be your legacy. YUGE Failure

The mandates must go
The time has come to IMPEACH his access, IMPROVE quality of life and give the middle finger to this #dotard #maga
It’s not Opposite Day.
We'll see on costs. Guaranteed they will have narrow, bad insurance. #DontheCon
Once again the EXTREME ABUSE of Executive Order!  PLEASE #MAGA & #ResignNow! #Impeachment is COMING CLOSER!!!

The time has come for me to take unilateral and unnecessary action to RESTRICT access, INCREASE premiums, and LOWER COVERAGE of HEALTHCARE! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918523263554412544 …
The time has come for trump to be impeached.
Give every citizen healthcare! One payer system for all. Join the rest of the world!
RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @RandPaul WE do NOT have a FREE MARKET in #Healthcare, because of these Corps.: AET, UNH, ANTM, CI, & HUM. #USA
You are doing nothing except punish those less fortunate. Not everyone has been bankrolled by a rich daddy. Baby Whiner liar
Dimwit, 6 states (GA, RI, OK, KY, WY & ME) allow purchase of out-of-state health plans. It's made NO difference in those places.
He keeps his promises
Hey Republicans learn something!
#Integrity

Like when Airlines deregulation prices will go down MD’S & INSURANCE COMPANY GUARANTEE PAYMENT OVER NOW THEY HAVE 2WORK 4 CUSTOMERS GBA
Evil pig
So @realDonaldTrump halts #CSR payments benefiting low-income #Americans; expect #Obamacare premiums to rise 25% by 2020. Stop  lying moron
TREASON
bawahahha that is exactly the opposite of what your actions will bring
just more collusion and price fixing.... NO COMPETITION and why should they with an imbecile they OWN FINANCIALLY at the helm?
Oh so does this mean you're resigning and putting Bernie Sanders in your place? Seriously, you are a lying beast.
You are just trying to destroy the ACA--stop it!
...Resign!
You just took away healthcare for the most vulnerable.Lack of healthcare does kill.It killed my father. Now you will be doing that to others
Thank you Mr. President for all you are doing for our Country. America stands very strongly with you! God Bless You and the USA!!!
Good job @realDonaldTrump Stock values for 5 major health insurance companies fell today after you signed that executive order. MAGA?
I love what Trump is doing.
RT @BallantineScott: RT @realDonaldTrump: The time has come to take action to IMPROVE access, ... http://tmi.me/1fjPEA 
Thank you for fighting for us Mr. President.  We are dying waiting for healthcare. We love you and The Vice President
@musicaljane1 Does O'Bummer have to line up in a queue like cattle to see doctor? I doubt it. Make congress get O'Bummer

Destruction is the only thing you excel at
CONGRESS DO YOUR JOBS or THE PEOPLE WILL FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN!

Yes we keep hearing the word action from you but not to much of it hay!! Get things moving #DonaldTrump
Your wreckage of an order will do none of this.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for taking action and starting the process that needs to be done. #MAGA 
If you & @VP don't already know that insurers can sell across state lines but don't want to. You have NO business messing w/health insurance
Dork
Remember when this is what you thought of Executive Orders? Like what you thought of Presidents traveling and golfing. #HypocriteInChief
So stopping payment on subsidies is helping lower costs? Interesting?
Here’s an idea maybe the Democrats should work with the Republicans we’ve always worked with your presidents
Proving once again that you don’t understand how insurance is sold and regulated at the state level.
Big talk, no action, no plan
#DotardTrump must be removed from office
#Invokethe25th @GenJohnFKelly
You are a delusional, impotent, idiot. You need to be removed from office for being a threat to the health and well being of this country.
No you just ripped HC FROM American's. Even Russia provides HC to it's people. Sad when Kim Jung Un isn't the craziest, meanest on planet.
IMPEACH 45!  This lying corrupt punk has just shown he will do nothing to help middle class, low income people!....C'mon Mueller!
And yet you just drove insurance premiums for everybody in the country through the roof wait until your voters figure it out
WE need a single payer health care system for all Americans...expand Medicare and Medicaid
SAD that you have to be reminded to sign, corralled like a cow. #25thAmendmentNow #ResignNowTrump
Can you not read, people? He's making it so that there will be more competition which means lower prices! Read it please!
Must be for the wealthy since your cutting subsidies for the poor
I know the people around are like this is bullshit what is this damn cry baby doing. Kelly get his ass
You are without a doubt,  the worst President ever.
You don’t know what you are doing. You don’t care about the poor or anyone else,  but yourself. Sad! #NotMyPresident
You wouldn't know how to design a health care system if one bit you in the ass.
You have gone from a "tin pot dictator " to just a " tin pot dick"! You destroy EVERYTHING that you touch!! RESIGN FOR AMERICA!!
Start by flexing your pen and removing those state lines. Competition would flood state markets with affordable plans.
And yet, you are doing exactly the opposite.. increasing costs, limiting/eliminating access, destroying lives! The time has come to IMPEACH
You locked yourself in the garage again grandpa.
You are a disaster
Thank you Mr. President
How does taking subsidies from poor people IMPROVE access, INCREASE choices, and LOWER COSTS?
I truly believe this will make a huge difference in cost.but it still needs the safety nets for the poor and pre existing.
LYING AGAIN. You LIE, Mr. President. You LIE every day. Everyone knows you're a LIAR. Nobody believes your LIES. You HATE OBAMA, that's all!
The plans the GOP put forward and your actions do none of this. You have failed and should leave office before you are removed.
The Russian collusion will bring you down. It's coming closer and closer.
45 th best president ever Impeach Now. please go golf this weekend an stay golfing until IMPEACHMENT @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @DavidCornDC
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for doing something senate wouldn't Hope you call them out make them shop for theirs #repealsenatehealthbenefits
Your words @realDonaldTrump  #MAGA #SEXUALPREDATORATWORK
You are a lying pig. It's easier to destroy things than it is to build them.  You will go down as the worst of the worst.
Thank You Mr. President For This. It will help so many Americans to have healthcare.
Vindictive and Unlawful
The plan you are presenting is shameful and heartless ... people will die. You have no right to push a plan with an executive order
My wish this Christmas? I wish for Donald Trump to get a visit from three ghosts. (Ask Barron he will explain it to you). @KeithOlbermann
Impeachment Time, I prefer 25th Amendment. You crazy fuck.
The CBO says you are raising premiums and destroying ACA.
Every thing you do makes us love Obama more.
Liar. Your exec order makes cost of ins skyrocket. People will die. All because you're so jealous of Pres @BarackObama. 
#TrumpIsAMoron
Will pre-existing mental issues effect ur ability 2 get healthcare? Ur rich, it won't. On another note, enjoy ur title as worst potus EVER!
You mean, like what we had before Obama care!  Repeal that God forsaken  invasion of my freedom of choice now!  It's breaking me! #MAGA
Despicable liar!!!! You should be impeached NOW!!!
Time to impeach this sorry excuse of a President.
So you want people to spend money for useless insurance plans.
Obama will be first with Healthcare. Anything Trump does is second place. A fix revision. Your advisors have killed your legacy.
When you say "Lower costs for healthcare" you dont talk about lower costs for the single payer. You meann the costs for the government.
If you have a health care with better conditions and lower costs nobody in senate will block a new bill. BUt you dont have.
You R Truly #AnEvilPerson #Heartless & could care less about the sick & poor! Most of us aren't buying Ur B.S. @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats
You're honestly just a horrible person.
Single payer system
Yeah, just like in your country,  Canada.
You don't understand insurance and health care and you don't care about those harmed by your ignorance.
you are a simple minded #dolt who thinks he can wish away Obama's legacy. #sad #25thAmendment
You know your supporters are among those most negativley affected, don't you?  Or don't you give a damn knowing they'll follow you into hell
By allowing worthless policies that in fact cover Nothing? Great idea!
Mr President,I am unemployed & using Retirement Account to survive. Will there be group insurance for unemployed?Obamacare is too expensive.
Trump will singlehandedly raise premiums for Americans as well as cost the government billions, in a stroke of the pen. He will try to blame the ACA, but this is on him, and he will pay the price for it.

It time to MAGA! Repeal and Replace Trump!
Big blow to Obamacare? More like big blow to trump supporters! Trump supporters are going to feel this big time
Trumpsters seem to forget "OBAMACARE" is called "OBAMACARE" because President Obama actually did work.
I work in healthcare.People shouldn't be forced to spend as much on health care as paying for daycare. If it competitive,it stays affordable
Thank you Potus for finally opening up competition from state to state for insurers!! We wanted this a long time!!
You do realize your plan will kill people and cause many thousands of others not to have insurance. YOU are the problem here - not the ACA
You're trying to murder poor children. Period.

Free market in healthcare is the answer. Break up the monopolies created by FDA, AMA, American Hospital Association, the insurance cartel.
The time has come to IMPEACH our racist @POTUS and EDUCATE the HATE that is POISONING our country.
All you lower income Trump supporters remember, it was him that cut your subsidies not congress.

We have plenty of choices, access is a piece of cake---just get on a computer or pick up a phone. Cost? Well you just really $#&@+* that up!
Insane  Tweet of the Day 6: 100% stone cold lies. Abuse of executive order (which he pilloried 44 about) #Trumpcare #UNFIT #LiarInChief
The policy might be cheaper to buy  but if someone gets sick the medical bills will bankrupt them. Be honest and talk about that.
All right. Today's problem should be solved in the way of tomorrow.
@GOP @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr Do your job and Impeach now!
Lie.
You people are so ignorant to think ACA solved anything. My $ tripled and my care suffered. The gov is the worst option to solve any problem
I pay $900 a month to not go to the VA for this very reason. The care is atrocious and the staff is the bottom rung of the field. Get a clue
you just signed the death certificate for thousands of Americans.  HOW ARE YOU MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?
