STUPID RUSSIAN HACK!!!!
OMG which one is Eric they all smell alike
It's the Trump effect.
Look at your 401k and IRA and say thank you.
If I had enough money to put into one I guess I would.  I need to put food on my table first

Stop taking credit for what take years to create growth .
give the kids their lunch money back
Trump is not only the worst President in history, already, but also the worst businessman ever! Biz council members dropping like bricks....
Make America GREEDY and disrespected. What a legacy.

So, if you are an out of work coal miner who just happens to have a large stock portfolio,,,,,, it's all good!
Yes we are going to make America great again..
bet he wishes he d have pulled out when he saw Eric
Wow...guess it is possible to have real money, real business sense and give a shit about others. #thingsdaddynevertaughtyou

Not related! Another trump lie!
How is your economy booming and being crippled by the climate agreement at the same time ?
Why is that you ask? Because deregulation means companies can poison and pollute without consequence while stealing retirement funds. #swamp

How, exactly?
Really? Keep watching your #fakenews If you were paying attention you wouldn't ask that. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
You still didn't give an example of winning. Cool American flag emojis though.
Withdrawal from #TPP #Parisclimateaccord , jobs #Keystonepipeline, #SCOTUS To name a few. Liberals give @POTUS credit
Keystone pipeline provides 35 jobs at a great risk to the environment. ALL of that oil will be exported. I'll give you TPP.
Four months and his greatest accomplishments are naming a SCOTUS nominee and withdrawing from a trade agreement. I could have done that.
He stole the SCOTUS seat so I wouldn't even give him that
So naive...
Make America Gag Again
Eric we're glad to hear daddies making your allowance grow again. @realDonaldTrump coal miners can't invest in stocks just B.S. shovels
We are praying for you @realDonaldTrump #PrayForTrump #GodBlessAmerica
The rest of the world is praying to god too!
Not to mention his frivolous private jet flights 6 times in 6 weeks! Liberals are the pollution we need to eliminate
@realDonaldTrump doesn't apologize for horrible deals @BarackObama made to hurt the Country
#GoToHellYouGreedySpoiledNitwit
How did you and junior fix your hair lips?
America has become a laughing stock on every level, champ.
The sky is falling LIBTARD.
Obama brings the market from 8000 to 19000. Trump takes the market from 19000 to 20000 and takes credit for market success.
So you approve of #Trump for his efforts to reverse everything Obama accomplished as President, out of spite & ignorance? That's depressing.
Amazing! My 401K is thru the roof! Greatest hiring surge in 40 years!  253K jobs added! Amazing accomplishment for new Presidency! Thank you
A lot of those jobs were procured by Obama.
Not really, Trump brought back/saved approx 1M jobs before even taking office
Holy shit! How much Tang did you drink?
Don't worry. The Bush administration didn't crash and burn the economy until his second term. These things take time. History repeats.
Nope, this will be more like Reagan Administration where the economy booms so well that it took Clintons second term to ruin it
Future generations - who will suffer for this short-sighed, politically motivated decision - thank you for this critical Wall Street bump.
It wasn't even related, yet another trump lie!!!
Time to melt and join the crowd .. President Trump is our President!

@POTUS we understand that you pulled this great stunt to deflect us away from Russian probe from you and family and cabinet!
It won't work!This is making us even stronger and more determined to get you all for treason and more!You won't like the stripe suit!No tie!
And HRC? What say you of her treasonous acts, hmmmm? @andreakayeshow @SgtTim911
Whattaboutism is a serious condition!
Donald should have started pulling out when you were born...that would have #MAGA
#resist
No, Fred should have pulled out first
Fred Trump proved the need for condoms...some things really are worse than STD
#PenicillinCantFixEverything
My 401k is thanking POTUS!! It's like the energizer bunny just keeps going up. So thankful for POTUS every day. Promises kept & MAGA!
Promises kept? He's violated a lot of his promises, particularly his oath in front of the small inauguration crowd
Yes ma'am he's keeping his promises but you're so far left and filled with hate. It's clouded your perception. You only see hate. 
No. I don't see hate. I'm waiting for an answer instead of a sad attempt at a deflection
What answers would you like? 1) jobs back 2) America first wait, you don't want jobs for Americans? You don't want America first? Who r u?!
what jobs ? name them don't just spout sh1t
Carrier and SoftBank to name a couple which o did name but you're one of the snowflakes who doesn't do anything but repeat
Carrier is having layoffs.  Try to keep up
So thankful for @realDonaldTrump 

#AmericaFirst
MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE
"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." 

#AmericaFirst 
#MAGA
The citizens of Pittsburgh overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton
Yes they did, and our president still affirms his commitment to them despite it. Liberals won too last November they just don't realize it
He buget cuts healthcare from millions.

Oh snd he is tearing apart @NATO
Thanks Obama!
The free market "got over" obama, hours after the election results came in. The markets rises with every obama action reversed.
Taking credit for 8 years of Obama's work, you and your family are pathetic
That's not how the stock market works. Prices fluctuate hourly based on news and bus announcements. The rise in prices reflects confidence.
Yeah great for yr rich friends
Not just the rich. Most people have IRAs, or 401Ks, the value of which may be linked to market valuations.
Fun fact: Hillary is not the president
Fun fact: Trump won't be president much longer
Right only about 7 more years!
Money usually does change hands when you sell something out (USA). You idiots did this so the rich get richer. This is evidence of that...
And how are the rich profiting from Paris?
Same way the oil folks profit from war. Certain industries will have less regulations, which drives futures under guise of more production.
Which increases the liquid value is said company, thus lining the pockets of the rich execs and shareholders.
Just imagine how great America will be when the Trumps burn it to the ground and turn every city to coal. Miners go back to work! JOBS!
What happened to all those melted ice caps. You should send Gore some more money
Nothing happened, they're still melting. By all means, come at me, but come at me with something that isn't stupid.
Really Gore said by 2016 completely gone
You should pay more attention to what scientists say about science and less to what politicians say about it.
That's it?   That's priceless
Isn't it? Imagine the libtard snowflakes getting their science from people who study it instead of people selling them shit. Dumb cucks!
How much money did Gore make on An Inconvenient Truth alone?
Can't wait for you both to be in jail. Traitor. No way u affect economy in 100 days but we will see the downturn in about a year due to you
So what? How does this help middle class? 7k to 20k under Obama, right yawns. 20k to 21k under Trump, you do a victory lap. #Joke
5/5 whose tax dollars contribute most to the economy?The rich.Who does more to damage America?NOT the rich.It's the loud belligerent left
I'm beginning to believe this whole family is delusional. But blood is thicker than water. And who are the boys momma?
Kaaa-Chinggg!!!  Woo-Hooo
@realDonaldTrump the whole government works FOR the PEOPLE. NOT to ENRICH THEMSELVES and friends!

you suck!
as a truck driver I see the country and today I've seen more "help wanted" signs then I have for a long time. POTUS is #MAGA  
@realDonaldTrump happened during Obama too!
Yup. The corporate world is smiling. The people, not so much. Have you forgotten who the government is supposed to represent? Apparently so.

Just make sure you guys keep owning the stock market when it inevitably falls.  We'll remind you in case you "forget."
Because it's all about the money, isn't it honey?
Thought you goons were supposed to stay out of politics to support the bogus optics of separating the family profits from the presidency?
Yes Eric, you're going to jail too. Have you considered an exile strategy?
So what? That exactly shows the financial markets are full of greedy people as shallow as President Trump who can see nothing but money! Sad

Very high market confidence !! Since day took office ! For several reasons ! Some intangible ! Many ridding of overburdensome regs etc

Go #SpecialCounsel #Mueller!!!
Do what you have to do and if that means making deals w/ Congress/Senate? Get tax reform & Fair Trade Passed.

nice
He Eric, do you like to grab like your dad?  Man…that’s so cool!
Stand by for record Profit taking.
OBAMA!
Amen. Pray they be honest with it...

The demonstration began after today's announcement. People are concerned about the lack of US leadership jeopardizing the whole planet. 
Thank you dad  for hell Youngstown Ohio 
Drone  delivery car which will be made Youngstown  with money trump give Youngstown

Barf 
All because of dear old dad trashing everything!
Slow down. Nothing's really happened. No real legislation passed. No real progress. You're still celebrating Obama's work. #Alreadygreat

It will be when daddy resigns and all you crooks are locked up #ImpeachTrump #Impeach45 #Lockhimup

Most people with a brain know that the stock market is NOT a true indicator of the REAL economy. Plus what goes up must come down.
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  Retweet if you love The Golden Rule.  Tweet the Golden Rule in your free time!
Thanks @POTUS44 !!!
Because they know you jerks want the rich richer. Thanks for thinking of us peons.
When the Trump family leaves the White House, America Will Be Great Again!
Good news, but in spite of what you think your father didn't have much to do with it  Eventhough he appears to believe he controls the world
That's all for the wealthy. What about the people whose health insurance you are going to take away?
All of you in orange jumpsuits would be a good start to making America great again
Why is it, you want to take credit for 30 meaningless minutes of woohoo by stk market, but never (ever) take responsibility when it tanks!??
Idiot.
And how's your dad doing in the Gallup polls?
So an increase in wealth for the FEW makes America great?! No. A more balanced distribution of wealth would be a start. #MoneyDrunkTrumps
The higher and faster it climbs, the bigger and harder the correction will be.  Didn't Daddy teach you anything?
You didn't do this! The stock market has been hitting records for years!
Yeah this is how Ur Daddy make America great again by committing crimes against American for his greedy wants so get out of here w/that shit
No thanks to you Uday or your brother Qusay...
WE KNOW WHY... THANKS PRES TRUMP

@realDonaldTrump you're fired
Get smart LOSERS!
Thank God Obama handed your crooked papa a good economy. But like most of your dads failed businesses , I'm sure he'll bankrupt us soon!
Kathy Griffin claims, "Trump broke me". How about Baron Trump, he's a child. Bet ya' he's a little "broken"?

Amazing the insight of President Trump. The terrorists who bring death to citizens is a witness against the unwilling to take a stand.
The majority of Americans aren't making money on the stock market
