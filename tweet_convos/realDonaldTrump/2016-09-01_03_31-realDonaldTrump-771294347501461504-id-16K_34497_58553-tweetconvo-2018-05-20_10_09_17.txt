you're going to make America pay for the wall, aren't you?
of course he is. He always was going to make America pay for it.
Who is more gullible than a Trump voter? 2 trump voters
@kmcbrd2 @realDonaldTrump how about 46.8% of the voters in America
Clearly 3million voters against Orange Pinocchio than for.  He can't love Constitution= not read
@tackertfg

Chinga tu puta madre.

 'This deal will make me look terrible': Transcripts of Trump's  w Mexico & Australia
The transcript is here!
Too much to hope you'd  come to a reasonable conclusion, Make America Sick,starve the Elderly& poor,pay to build a wall 
idiot!

@JoeAlv why would you build a wall when everything comes in through tunnels?
Just like you paid the Contractors of the DC hotel?
Mexico:
Who, who is going to pay for the wall?   Err, wait, #Drumpf supporters, let me get back to you on that.  #notmypresident
RT "@realDonaldTrump: Mexico will pay for the new Chargers stadium !"
Leaked transcript reveals Trump asked Mexican president to stop saying he wont pay for border wall #FuckTrump http://hill.cm/aHdBboQ 
Poor lil Donnie, mean ole Mexican prez won't go  along w/your lie? That's what u ask for a wall that Mexico wld pay, so NO, NO WALL!
I'd put ten bucks on building the wall and if every other citizen put in ten bucks it would be built...
With all the problems in the world, you're tweeting about a useless wall???!!!! #unpresidented
@MileHighGreco And the wall will be a combined series of walls and fences
I just RT it bc I think it's funny. Don't think there will be a  wall built.
There will be, but it will be funded by the private sector and not Mexico. I am a conservative FYI
I'm independent. Thought both candidates were trash.
I did as well. Didn't vote for either. Both too divisive to govern
All Eyes On #TomasYarrington 

Only chance to #MakeMexicoGreat #MMG
This tweet has aged as well as a nice bottle of Blue Nun liebfraumilch.
Then why is our government shutdown over our taxes paying for the wall?
Hey #ShitholePresident - who will pay for your bigoted wall of ignorance?? US taxpayers? #MAGA Mueller ain’t going away
umm hmm.... now today's headlines are saying you want US TO PAY FOR THE WALL!!! what a surprise. #theresistance will fight this all the way.
No need to cross the Border; get a job building the Wall. Who else wants to do it; no one from mid west for sure. Jobs?
Trump lost the election. Appointed by the electoral college, he's the most illegitimate president in US history.

oh how the tables have turned
Report: Trump will ask Congress to pay for U.S.-Mexico border wall: http://bit.ly/2ihxfN6  
.@realDonaldTrump @JuddApatow We all just didn’t read the fine print — didn’t check to see *which* Mexico he meant. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico,_Missouri …
He's a liar. His voters will find out with this request to have U.S. taxpayers pay for it.
All Hail the Conquering Hero!
Lol LIT!!! RT @realDonaldTrump: Mexico will pay for the wall!
@limelite001 aye
jobs for locals too
let me speak in words you understand:  liar, liar, pants on fire! 
you spelled pantsuit wrong
that wasn't a funny response or even clever. keep trying
The wall is another one of your delusional fantasies, like the idea that you're a smart successful businessman, or a hardcore negotiator.

@miIkwaIker I am not sure if I am happy or sad that Zach is not on twitter at this point.

You can't get blood out of a turnip... Just because YOU want something doesn't mean it will happen.. If it's that important.. YOU pay for it

@YouCowardlyLion and oh, by the way, we won't let you build this stupid wall either.

Wall at Mexican Border? this will be a great employment program for Mexicans to be paid by USTax payers; likely illegals...
.@realDonaldTrump .@DustinGiebel NAFTA gives jobs to Mexicans so they don't come here. Wall or no wall without NAFTA they will flood USA!
@NBC @ABC @CBS @CNN Trump Asks Congress To Approve Money To Build HIS Mexican Boarder Wall! BILLIONS Of Our Taxpayer Money

@PerritoFeick Pagame el pene mejo
dónde le empiezo???
It seems unreasonable for mexico to build a wall that the USA needs desperately. It's long over due. US must build!
Do not make Mex. Pay for our (USA) border. They will soon feel they have authority where it doesnt belong.
20% import fees on US products to Mexico. It's going to cost America more in the end
@DonSinpelos  WTF !!! aun así la gente le votó #ElectionNight
@AndresGzz ni le recuerdes wey!
justo me estaba acordando de ti!! Hahah, al menos Maine ya se fue con Hillary 

So, you failed in getting Mexico to pay for the wall. In fact you alienated our neighbor in the process. Now, even though border crossings are at their lowest for the entire century, you have lied and stirred up racial hatred to strong arm the American public into paying for it!
Another LIE from the mouth of Master Fornicator Donald Fucking Trump. I got a C-note that Mexico will not pay 1 peso for your wall of division; nor should they. MAGA by IMPEACHING your 239lbs, more BS,
Stupid says what?
Mexico will pay for the wall with a banana #WithABanana

Mexico will pay for the wall!
Haha haha haha
Still a liar
Let the American people pay for the wall through donations. Better a wall than millions of illegal aliens we pay for daily.
Most of your tweets don't age well, but this one... this one aged like a child actor that got hooked on meth.

Do tell
It's not the Dreamers fault that they are here, and it's not their fault that YOU made a promise you can't keep.  DACA should not be tied to your false promises.
TRANSLATION: I lied my ass off. Now I'm holding hundreds of thousands hostage to get the US to pay for it instead!
Mexico will pay for the wall!
TRANSLATION: DACA was made difficult by me ending it just so I could offer to reinstate it for my wall. I'm using 800,000 latino people as hostages to get my money. That's what I mean when I said "Mexico will pay for it". I'm horrible.
DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin’ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!

So you lied about the wall? You've lied thousands of times, it's like breathing air to you. And who could forget this zinger:  "You're going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it is going to be so easy"

Pfffttttt. #Undignified #Unqualified #ITMFA
 here’s ur wall
Lmfao
#dumbfuckdonald
#LiarInChief

WTF Donnie?
Then why are you asking the taxpayers for the funds now? We'll wait until Mexico pays up and then build the wall. Live within your means.
Um. This is awkward
Who’s gonna pay for the wall? Mexico! Who? Mexico! Who? Um I guess we are dear leader.
que?
Mexico will pay for the wall!
Fake President's tweets don't age well. #DACA
