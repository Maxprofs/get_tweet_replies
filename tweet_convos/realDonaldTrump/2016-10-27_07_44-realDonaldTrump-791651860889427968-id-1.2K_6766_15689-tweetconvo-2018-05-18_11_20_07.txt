And you're a white supremacist in our nation will not tolerate bigoted people like you!
Sounds like you have anger issues
there is a difference between anger and passion
There is also a difference between smart and educated.
you are neither
yes, your parents are first cousins.
Can You Prove that?
Why don't you did denounce your buddy Putin?
why you mad Russia supposedly stole her illegal emails? If she hadn't committed crime it wouldn't be issue
so Ethel and Julius Rosenberg our heroes to you?
how did she fail?
Trump doesn't know how to create jobs. If it wasn't for his daddy's 14 million, he would be working as a greeter in Walmart
He surpassed his father's employee count and he employ's thousands.so your wrong.
You, my mentally impaired friend are wrong. Without Fred there is no Donald
Your insane.
