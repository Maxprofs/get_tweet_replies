truly an unpresidented win!!
do you feel "honered" to have watched that game?
the Budweiser commercial was great!
the Audi one was great too!
Yup.  So was the AirBnB one.
CNN reported in 3rd quarter that Falcons had 94% chance of winning the Super Bowl. #FakeNews
don't compare a fucking football game to the election
The #Patriots came back to win against all the odds just like President #Trump! #SuperBowl #MAGA #Brady
not the same year
typical liberal hahahaha
you mean I can read a calendar?  Hopefully that's all humans
The season began in 2016, just like the inaug was jan
however that's not what you said.  So yeah.
.@realDonaldTrump I thought you didn't like NFL football?
I'm not going to be watching much NFL football anymore. Too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft. Focus on other things!
.@realDonaldTrump You used to say that the games were boring.
The NFL image is really tarnished! Now, if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down, the NFL will be in big trouble. Boring games!
.@realDonaldTrump And "such long commercials."
There are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these NFL games that they are no longer worth watching. Soft hitting & boring!
.@realDonaldTrump Maybe you could take credit for making Super Bowl exciting again?
So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
will you ever just shut the fuck up for ten seconds
thanks, gman
Thanks, Mark Howler.
it's always the damn racist eggs
lmao
Fuck you, you fucking garbage piece of shit.
this is the behavior that pushes moderates slightly more to the right.
i love that Sky continues to be right.
LOL

ppl wonder why there's so much political discord. 
americans just wanna just fight anyone online, andâ€¦
me nigga what's up
i don't wonder at all. you know nothing about my stance on the matter.
Funny everyone was booing Roger Goodell he is like the media shills.
the 3 doors down potus has no room to laugh at anyone's popularity....ever again,
you don't get it, popularity we could care less Hollywood does nothing for American people, they are nothing but overpaid
not even any help from Putin...
and this was an actual win unlike your victory.

.@realDonaldTrump cheaters triumphed just like you
This from a man who steals his bio from Ghosts of Versailles? Did you credit Glass? No; you're a thief.
Glass didn't write Ghost of Versailles
I don't know why I thought it was Phillip Glass??
it would be quite the different opera- he did the train wreck 'the voyage' 2 seasons later
This exchange is a breath of fresh air in a fart factory.
late 20th century opera trumps trump & Brady!
I love Tom Brady. He's gorgeous.
The #SoCalledPresident appreciates the #DeflateGate quarterback @realDonaldTrump. #SuperBowl
Lol you sound upset!
Wait, you can hear me @Mike_Gio123? Are you in my bushes?
Nah man, but I'm sure you have wonderful bushes!
That is as creepy as the last tweet @Mike_Gio123

it's going to feel a lot worse in Feb 2021, Ben
Trump the Patriots couldn't have done it without you! All strength comes from Trump! #BiglyWin

lol ok, that's why he's always winning.
except for court cases, I guess.
That's not over yet. It's a temporary stay.
which one?
lol
and popularity contests... He's a world class loser.
As if you saw it, we all know you were watching 'Finding Dory' again.
Yeah, press pool reported he left his watch party when the Pats were down
Is Dory what Melania named his penis?
Melania named Trumps penis "Kommandant"...
'Personal Vietnam' 
or just "NOOO" or maybe she calls it ATM
.@realDonaldTrump
hahahaha - hey Orange Dumpster Fire, go fuck yourself!
