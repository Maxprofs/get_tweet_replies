Trump will get prison. How about that?
People that bring peace dont go to jail. Obama should though.

Hello, Non American Troll
Please stuff your propoganda up Clinton's ass.

If you say that he isn't your president, you aren't American.

Bye bye!
We respect the office not the man.  He will never be my President!
Thanks for fixing the Koreas!
I didn’t realize everything was fixed already. Hmmm.
Actually, yes. The first time Kim has EVER set foot in South Korea. Complete denuclearization underway. A literal Tree of peace planted by leaders of both countries. What more do you want? You Trump haters are just pathetic people. You hate your own country, or this a fake acct?
EMPTY THE DOCTORS OFFICE AT THE WHITEHOUSE!!  DUH.
Be sure to tell Dr. Ronny!  Perhaps he can give up his stash.
I'll be there! #TakeBackDay
You have a fucking drug dealer working for you in the White House!
Do u have anything better to do then stalk the greatest president ever tweets? Stop following him. Get on board or leave.
Bot
mr president yes sir but also how have issues been with your not-so-friendly neighbour Kim Jong Un?
I urge all Americans to vote Donald Trump out of the White House in 2020! @shafpatel
Fool
EXACTLY!!!! No proof given
You’re a fool
You must have a whole lot over there, thanks to Ronny.
What a scheme, Grifter Don! Then you can have Doc Ronny sort them for you in those little day-of-the-week boxes and you’ll be set for life! Do you want coke, too? Sounded like you had quite the buzz going yesterday morning on @foxandfriends! 
He was so manic. And it wasn’t even a Monday.
Whiners
I know, right?  “Witch hunt!  Crooked Hillary! I won!! My fixer is being raided!  This is a YUGE disgrace!!”   Yep.  Nothing but whining.   
You have ZERO credibility. Just SHUT UP and let us cruise into our weekend without your pre-pubescent voice droning on and on and on...

How did he do that, its quit genius. Im on a phone, so I cant make an image like @Airvooocht just did, but I like it. Doesn't even look that easy. But if I have that message for Drumpf, I have this 1amo ofcause. Memes are my thing, like many other tweeters, only with content
Great message!
You've obviously already tossed your meds, crazy old man. #FoxRant
Do the same for AR15
I hear Dr. Ronny Jackson is heading up this program!!!!
And I need a Xanax.
Why not just throw them away?
Are you going to dispose of all those RX that Ronny Jackson has IRRESPONSIBLY dispensed in the WH?
Is this why you haven't fired Ronnie?
Take Back Day to me means take back the government from corrupt and criminal politicians like Donald Trump! #MuellerTime #ImpeachTrump #LockHimUp
Nah I pass take those pills and shove it up your behind!!
The face of the real drug dealers!
He's in BIG with the pharmaceutical companies. #drugwar #DrugTakeBackDay #Pharmaceutical #pharmacy

Will you be taking back your illegally dispensed by Dr. Ronny Jackson Provigil???
I think he’s probably going to hang on that that. You know, just in case...

Your son, your son-in-law, and your campaign manager met with a Kremlin emissary hoping to get dirt on Clinton produced by a secret Russian plot. This sent a signal to Putin's regime: Trump has no problem with Moscow covertly intervening in US election to help Trump campaign. …
#TakeBackDay is not tomorrow! It's November 6th when we TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY from you and your band of co-conspirators.

How about trying this with guns instead of medicine that’s probably needed?
Oh yeah we’ll just send the cops to everybody’s house and collect all guns, that shouldn’t take too long

@iluvchristie That's cute you would like to see law abiding American citizens unarmed. However, guns are not the problem. My daily carry is a Glock 19. More good guys should carry. 
I never said I want to see them unarmed. Simply saying a gun drop off might be better than a Rx one, especially considering all the drugs tomorrow will prob go to trump’s candyman 
I guess I should clarify my previous post, be kind of funny people just throw their birth control pills in the drop off so they can say they participated in the event so we can have another baby boom.

TakeBackDay? Like, as in Take Back America Day? GREAT!!! What do we do with you? Can we send you, your dead eyed wife and your golden toilet back to NYC, or have they locked the gates?
First good idea Trump has had since stealing office and making a mockery of our great nation. I support this tweet of his while supporting a #BlueWave and #ItsMuellerTime
I doubt he wrote this or even knows about it. And since Obama started this program, I’m shocked he would approve promoting it! 

But I agree this is a good program.
Please resign.

It's coming from Chinner and India!
Somebody has had to have already beat me on Twitter and responded with “when is takebackmyelectoralvote” day.... 
Wish i could say it was me!
Ha! I’ll step back and let you take credit for it :)
OK, if you insist!
@RonPaul on the drug war...
Almost. A few profit.
Is this a weird joke? After your Candy Man has been all over the news?
For the love of god someone wake me up from this dream...
Most Americans will celebrate "takebackday" the day when you are officially out of our White House for good!
Does anyone know where Wall Boy is golfing this weekend? He could golf here. The weather tomorrow. Cloudy in the 70's.

This one made me squeal.

What about the drugs Ronny Jackson has prescribed? Can those be returned?
It sounds to me that he needs to put the president on diet pills.
It would help if he walked instead of riding a golf cart everywhere too 
I would like those millions of people who had a brain freeze and voted for you to take their vote back p
Did you copy Dr. Ronny on this?
Sean Hannity, The Cheetos Best Bro, loved the HOUSING CRASH. Made BIGLY MONEY

I urge all republican congressmen, senators and the butt nuggets working in the White House to resign today!
I wish there was a deposit box where we could take back our old, unwanted useless orange presidents. Now that would be something I could contribute bigly to
Lol
Well, you can certainly tell our idiot in chief didn't write this tweet, no misspellings and not one person is being insulted. Wow!

Ring me when it’s take back the White House day. Until then I’m gonna need my opioids. #DonTheCon #LiarInChief #FakePresident #Corruption #Conspiracy #ObstructionOfJustice

Is Dr. Ronny gonna take back all that candy he gave you?

WHY ARE YOU, MAKING MILLIONS OF ELDERLY AND CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS SUFFER, WE ARE NOT DRUG ADDICTS, AND DO NOT ABUSE ANYTHING!! MAYBE EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS, SENATE AND YOUR STAFF SHOULD TAKE A DRUG SCREEN, I JUST BET THIERS A BIG PROBLEM ON CAPITAL HILL!!
Sorry!!! With you in office, I need my prescription meds more than ever!!!
Dr. Jackson should be first in line.
"And again, the place to dispose of your prescribed opiates is the mailbox at Kellyanne Conways' house."
@johnlegend.
Thank you @BarackObama!
Is it take back the former President Day soon? Any of them will do.
And who thought we’d sincerely mean that? When “W” looks like a genius, you know our country is in serious trouble!
No way he wrote this no way
Anyone who gives back opioids is a fool! U may not need em now, but u will later..and take it from someone living w/ disability and good reason to use em..the current practice of denying meds means u'd be lucky to get more even if u need them. Secure them in a disaster kit/ safe.
Medical cannabis solves all of this. But we all know what the Neo-conservative, Trumpster Republicans think about a plant... No profit for their big pharma lobbyist buddies and the companies making drugs that have more side effects than the disease symptoms they treat. #cannabis
Medical? Screw that...kidding, but recreational is the way to go! ! If all of America went recreational like my state..they'd have more money than they need for schools and roads..like we do. And police would be free to actually protect and serve, and worry about violent crimes
Oh I agree 100%. But, we live in an idiotic country. Baby steps. Lol
Fun fact about OR is we quietly decriminalized ALL drugs. Not officially, but we dont prosecute for personal amounts. Opting instead for diversion. Its working great! Now if only we regulated sales of things like morphine..people would stop dying from fentanyl/ heroin overnight.
What about all of us that have chronic pain and now our drs are pulling our meds from us? What about our quality of life?
Are you taking back all of Admiral Jackson's Percocets?
How about taking back some of the ones your VA nominee doled out?

Alrighty should we start in the white house first? All staff In The West Wing get back all the pills what are you didn't have prescriptions. Starting with you Donny boy
Collection vats to feed the junkies in the Whitehouse?
You didn't write this.
Turn in your Rogaine, fucknut
Is this how Ronny Jackson builds up his personal stash of drugs?
Make sure you take all your candy that Ronny gave you.
The White House is a good place to start.
You can’t blame drugs for your insanity, Donnie.
Is Dr. Jackson going to participate in this? If so, he better have some 55 gallon trash bags on hand for all the ones he handed out & takes back.
“Only the mob takes the Fifth.”
You need prescription medication!
Chew on this Donnie Dementia...We invite all Americans to participate in Take Back Our Country (TBOC).
Prison for life or lethal injection depends on the state for dog leash abuser/murderers especially white Supremacist group. The yups and their wives are active murders. Perish and end their lives for the actions and this crime they have committed against me

Cannibalism is running rampant. The norm eat real food like root veggies, turkey, stuffing. Evil wickedness will not win, you sinners. Go to hell now in God's way
Take back day should be to take back votes that made you the Compromised President.

NO WAY!

People can't get medical insurance, afford prescriptions, earn a living wage ect.... You never know when you might NEED that medicine again!
How about they impeach your ass and TakeBackAmerica before u destroy it u bloody ignoramus orange idiot
LOL, I’m going to follow you just because of this very tweet.
True story.

Lock him up.
Do you get all of your speed from the candyman?
Just in case you did not know (because having the honor of being POTUS clearly does not require one to know what the society they represent looks like) most healthcare providers (including mental healthcare)assists people in safely disposing of meds daily.
I'm guessing you slept through that part of the opioid conference when they informed you of this information and I know you've never got your hands dirty actually serving those in your community (or the country) who desperately need support.
In fact,  just STFU.
@johnlegend 
This doesn’t seem to matter. My husband suffers from a rare bone disease called Padgetts of The bone. He is in advanced stage. He is riddled with osteoarthritis and cringes with every step. His bones are brittle and twisted now, the VA said, oh well do the best you can.

You have time for this crap but not ONE word about the waffle house incident or the kid who saved everyone. I know he is black...
Is Ronny Jackson going to turn in all his prescriptions that he gave out without medical checkups?
Wow, you're actually promoting one of Obama's policies? "
Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010" 
Thanks @BarackObama !

While Taje Back day is important, on a global level, today is also Pay it Forward day. Please make an effort. (Trump would never ask...he never pays anything forward)
Are you going to threw away all your "diet" and "stamina" pills?
Sleep and wakeup pills too?
Will the White House be participating in this? With all that  being passed around I really think it's important to include Dr Ronny & friends.
I’ll just give mine to Dr. Jackson and he can disperse them properly.
Pills don't kill people, people kill people.
You’re thinking of guns. Pills kill guns... or I’m confused.
Danger to our water supply. No we are not all moving to Mexico and starting a new world order there!
God is alive in his faithFUL.
As part of this effort, please encourage states to legalize marijuana for medical use!  Opioids are are dangerous, have nasty side effects, and are ADDICTIVE.  Many who need help with severe nerve/neurological pain refuse to take them.  Access to safer medical "hemp" wd help!
The effects of hemp and opiates are not even similar. Hemp is not half the pain killer of an opiate. but it’s not half as harmful ether. The truth is Hamp isn’t half as good a painkiller as Advil. Not as bad as opiates. I don’t see that as a good argument.
It works on neurological issues better than either one.  You need to research! It's not addictive.  Why are you people so afraid of a natural plant product????
neurological issues So far from the typical reason people use a painkiller
I use advil for basic muscle aches or the occasional headache. Opiates just dull the mind and make people sleepy -- they're highly addictive.  I really don't see what the big deal is about legalizing hemp products for medical use! You can find testimonies galore about benefits!

Trump hasn’t even met with North Korea yet and you’re giving him credit.
You must have quite a stash of psych meds because you sure in the hell aren’t taking them!
I'm not sure that this will do a thing to combat drug addiction/abuse. If we don't fix the functionality of the family as in with values, morals, spirituality...nothing else will matter. It's all a bandaid on a gaping wound.
can we take you back?
Is Dr. Ronny Jackson participating?
Who are you and what did you do with Donald Trump?
I urge all Americans to participate in “Take Back Out Sanity and Dignity” day by making sure you are forcibly removed from office, you, your family and conspirators are jailed for various crimes and that you all end up poor. Stupid has been achieved already.
Where did you dispose of yours? I mean, doesn't matter, you can just get more from Ronny after the photo op, right? 
Who wrote this for you?

Mr. Trump, and I say that with great respect, president was a term we come to say for a person who was put in office for Wit just a figure head for our previous government. You are a biusness man and not a political puppet. So Mr. And or sir. Is respectfully.

You only want people to dispose them so they have to buy more. #BigPharma
Let’s do the same for guns. It’s been very successful in other countries and gun violence has decreased exponentially. In the USA the NRA controls the GOP and Trump and pays Congressmen to boycott gun commonsense laws. Right, @SpeakerRyan ?

I don't say to overdose. Just doing what I can for my life to be easy.
Maybe we should tell doctors to stop writing so many prescriptions, then we wouldn't need a #takebackday
It’s all your fault @realDonaldTrump of why North and South Korea made up!
