Who told you that? We all know you don't read.
Yes Clarke the sheriff collecting his salary but not in Milwaukee.Killed guy in jail with dehydration, a mother in cell gave birth baby died
People are dying and you're promoting a book. Ugh.
So Felix Sater was trying to set up the Trump Tower Moscow deal for you with Putin?Soon after Putin says nice things about you? Interesting.
Might want to change your spray tan color, not sure how well orange on orange works.
Hmmmmmm a year now and still no evidence. You just about worn out that #Russiancollusion thing, don't you think......
No evidence? What alternative universe are you living in?
@ChristiChat @SheriffClarke
Thick as thieves.
To all the geniuses who don't think Trump can read, how long ago did you make your first billion?
Hey David, Donald has not read your book! He doesn't like to read!
When did you become family and know what he does?
Now your promoting more hate!?! Not presidential.
No one is forcing you to buy it #cupcake
You & that stupid MF need to round up Joe Arpaio and then
Joe Arpaio is a patriot. Obama pardoned dangerous criminals. One committed murder as soon as he was released. Where's your outrage?
I guess we differ on what a great guy looks like

You can't even read though
Wow!  Really? Please put a little more thought into your response. You're sounding more like a parrot than a thoughtful human being.
3 Years, 4 Months, 24 Days, 5 Hours, 14 Minutes, and 55 Seconds
Mr. President, what about the flooding in Houston? Any recommendations?
Flooding? #HurricaneHarvery "I pardon you"
Wait a second, are we to use Amazon to buy a friends book? I thought Amazon was evil...
There is a natural disaster/humanitarian crisis, lives lost, devastation in the country YOU preside over and you...this...there are no words
Will delivery be delayed to the gulf coast of Texas?
Thanks for the Recommendation.  WILL PURCHASE.
What are you Oprah now! 

Flooding has gotten so bad in Houston that officials are telling people to get on their roofs to escape the water. https://twitter.com/NWSHouston/status/901765351960190976 …

As Texas wash's away... this is what you come up with? You can't even fucking read... look what I read...
For some reason…I highly doubt you actually read this book
Are you fucking kidding me. People are underwater in Texas and you are shilling this monster's book?
Did you "read" it "monitoring" the hurricane? Who helped you with the big words?
This is the guy who said of African Americans "they're uneducated, they're lazy and they're morally bankrupt"
Houston is facing catastrophic flooding and Trump becomes a bookseller on Twitter?
Clarke also claimed that BLM would one day join forces with ISIS. Why is Trump promoting this guy? (Nevermind, I think we all know)
Really you're doing very poorly in painting Clarke in a bad light if all he did was say the uncomfortable truth
Have you ever read one?
Poor Wittle Andy who could never into Wharton! We'll add you to the boycott list as well! You're welcome!
So this was a book on tape you heard on Fox?
Thanks for supporting amazon, save me taxes soon
You are the absolute worst judge of character I have ever seen.  I'm embarrassed for you.
is it really #WorthReading ?
who cares :/
Do you even know how to read a book?
Why are you promoting books now on Twitter.  We didn't sign up to "Trump's Book Club" when we followed you!
 How bizarre -- One day Mad Trump attacks Amazon, the next day he tweets an advertisement for it. This asshole's mind is truly unhinged.
Trump = O. B. S. T. R. U. C. T. I. O. N.
Everyone knows you can't read... good try

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." 
Don't act like you read

#जीने_की_राह Trump Sir, We are also sending you a link to a holy book. You are kindly requested to read this book. https://goo.gl/nPDh6U 
Kabir is a complete God
Please must wach https://twitter.com/DassDurgesh/status/896752924482617344/photo/1pic.twitter.com/o81EbdvGkR 
What is the matter with you? Promoting an entirely unrelated book while devastation hits Texas as we speak is borderline callous
KNOCK IT OFF with your hollow ASS tweets DUMP TRUMP.
Promoting a book this morning, while people are fighting for their lives in Houston, is beneath the office of President. #Houstonflood
Are you checking on the safety of those in Texas? No? Yeah, I didn't think so
Mr. Trump, PLEASE add more people like Sheriff Clark to your cabinet, and get rid of the globalist democrats.  I'm BEGGING you!
Did you actually read it?
You're not recommended
Your citizens are sitting on their roof waiting for rescue from #Harvey, and you're tweeting a book recommendation? Sad!
And what else would you have home do? Fly over and airlift people himself?
Appoint Fema deputy directors, NAOO director and DHS director. Assure us that there will be no govt shut down. He needs to do his job.
@FEMA_Brock just stated that Trump is deeply concerned and incredibly engaged .

Who the hell would read that stupid book anyway.
Probably plagiarized like the jerks thesis

Iii
Lots of sexual misdeeds out there, huh, Donny? #youtootrump Resign or be downed by your treachery and treason.
Awesome book!
I have great respect for Sheriff Clarke. We need him in public office.
But it. God Bless sheriff Clark
how would you know dotardDonnie, every one is  telling me that you can not  read.
Got 2 better books for you - "Trump Is F*cking Crazy" and "Conscience of a Conservative"

Hi uu I b
Why are you promoting this book and not promoting donations to the Red Cross? Maybe you don't donate to charities but most Americans do.
Do you live under a rock? He gave a million to flood victims. How much have you donated?

There are literally only a handful of Trump supporters (not even Alt-Right) at #Berkeley - Yet Antifa violently riots anyway. Terrorists.

Guarantee you haven't read it
Guarantee u have no clue. Hate preceeds logic, always.
Just another whinny crybaby who can't handle #CrookedHillary getting obliterated in the election
If you don’t have time to read it, it available on audio book. Narrated by the man himself, Sherif Clarke. Great book!
Illegal to count the book, unethical immoral and stupid as well you're in a Groove

I didn't buy the stupid book Trump tweeted, instead I donated to The Red Cross. 

Do your part;…
I'm sure Texas will appreciate it you fuvkwit
Do you realise he's black? Or did your pr guy tweet that?
You love your criminals, don't you?
You should put the sherif in a nice position. Utilizing his potential for America.
Yeah, if you like sadistic bullcrap.  You praise the worst humans. You are not worth this tweet
Yea, that's what's important now fathead
Did anyone mention there's a hurricane going on? Well, people need to do something while they wait 10 hours to be rescued. #fraud #impeach

Clip is from live chopper feed by @kcranews in #Berkeley. No cops seen, this is #Antifa. http://www.kcra.com/article/police-make-arrests-as-clashes-break-out-during-berkeley-protests/12102667 … 
Written by a guy who let people die of dehydration in his jail. I'm sure that's why you approve of him & Arpaio.
Who was it that told you this is a great book by a great guy???? First you don't read. Not sure you know how to very well.........
I really wish you read our replies to you. Then you'd know exactly how Americans with hearts feel about you. But you're a coward.
It must have had pop-ups for you to understand? Seems u live in a reverse world where all that is hateful is good. Good job child-president
By WHO ? You? not really much of a recommendation is it ....
What's it called...
"How to Survive a CAT4 @POTUS" ???
Sold, I'm buying it.
We know you don't read books, Donald. You said so in your book---which I also haven't bought.
lol @ you thinking anyone believes that you read an entire book.

I don't think so. Clarke is a traitor and crook just like u, wouldn't waste my time reading that propaganda shit.
You can read?
What is the matter with you?  During a deadly hurricane. What is wrong with you?
C'mon, you don't read books!
Oh, you do pick your friends. Showing your true abominable colours. Wonder why he resigned? You recommended his book!xxx
Where is the Law..we will have to fight back and people are going to be very badly Hurt..
You're a president, not Oprah's book club.
Oh go blow it out your ear!
how much did you get paid to post this?
Sir don't do book reviews. Stay on the Bible and the Art of the deal.
Just what the nation needs during a natural disaster, Oprah 2.0 tweeting a book recommendation. U have no idea what you're doing. Worthless
#ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
Who read it to you?
This is how you use the office of the presidency? #Disgrace #Dunce #Drumpf #AmericaHater #Traitor #GUILTY
Did you color in your book yet Donnie John? #TrumpLies
http://nypost.com/2016/01/17/after-pardoning-criminal-marc-rich-clintons-made-millions-off-friends/ …  At least you did not sell pardons for 1/2 Million plus..
UNCLE TOMS CABIN
I read that book in 3rd grade. It should sell well in Klan Country. Especially with The Grand Dragons Endorsement .
People are dying and you're endorsing a book. I hope you drown in your own vomit. #FakePresident
@SheriffClarke Like you even read it.  It is the worst POS written, full of flawed thinking!
Not interested, however i am going to read Green's great book on the trump/bannon lovefest.
Houston is drowning and you're shilling books?  I'm speechless...
Ah, bullshit. You don't read!
OK....If you recommend it, I won't read it!

Must have a lot of pictures for you to get through it
What do skeletons call their friends with? A cell BONE
Who are you kidding you can't read and your only thoughts are created through fox news.
Houston is under water and they're asking for volunteers with boats and your promoting books. #ResignTrump
Great Guy , Sheriff Clark.
Shut up, Donald.
you?! A reader if books?!

The media need to wake up and see Antifa for what they really are. Domestic terrorists. 

Haha I've seen better books by better people. So no thanks
got a movie to recommend?

My city is underwater. People losing everything. Unrelenting storm. Medical/1st responders on NO sleep. Thanks for book recommendation, tho. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901772550405070848 …
Houston needs toilet paper. Send "Art of the deal," too!!
Oh yeah? Describe your favourite part.
People are under water in Texas right now, but thanks for this book reco from @amazon (who you bashed a few weeks ago) #Resist #HarveyStorm
Likely the subject of one of your future pardons for his own violations of civil rights & ignoring court orders, right?
This is exactly what Americans would want from their president during a crisis; book recommendations. #Priorities
#realDonaldTrump i want to see if ucan autograph a copy of this book for me. Pls reply, mr. Trump. Thanks v much!! #cal_tiger #slumdogceo
the guy is a self hating clown in a ten gallon hat.  painful to watch people selfhate for financial gains
Who gives a fuck????
What about my book and action fund @POTUS ? I know you gave me the pardon, but I was hoping to put some more money in my pocket?
Step And Fetchit' was one of the richest actors of his day. But I don't think even he believed his BS act reflected his people. Sad sack of
How can a guy that doesn't read recommend a book? Did Fox News suggest it?
Promoting a book during a disaster is a new low especially this book. How about telling people how to help people if TX instead.
Ah yes, the great guy who lets people die of THIRST in his prisons.
Can the POTUS endorse a particular book or product?  If he can perhaps he should recommend national flood insurance.
He's a horrible person.
@LindseyGrahamSC why is POTUS hawking books on Twitter
https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.html … Lies lies lies. The worst president in history. #Corrupt #resist #impeachtrump
Like you read books!! LOL!!!
Let me guess, you own shares in the publishing company that's behind this book. So today you're not a racist?
Great guy??   Holy shit balls man!!  This guy is hate wrapped in a shitball. F'n wake up. We DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!!  #TrumpLies
You are an embarrassment.  Please resign
Just watched your news conf. &BOOM now you got it, it's called ammunition and believe me your well stocked.  S Joe
Weren't you supposed to be worried about Houston instead of hawking books? Houston, we have a problem!
You should resign immediately if for no other reason (and there are innumerable) that you tweeted this during a national crisis. Shame.
You can read????
Disgusting
Ewwwwww. Just EEWWWWW. Ask @IvankaTrump what she thinks of him.
What do you recommend the thousands of people who are homeless now due to the floods in TX?
Didn't you say that Amazon was a terrible website destroying small businesses?
Fuckheads of a feather flock together.

Washington Post gets it right! We bash the media a lot. Important to give them kudos for being truthful (for a change). 
The man is a lunatic.
The only thing that man's book is good for is toilet paper
