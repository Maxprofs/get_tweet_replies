The clock on President Trump's first 4 year term shouldn't begin until his nominees are confirmed and the Mueller Witch Hunt is over...

His first 1.5 years has been filled with nothing but interference & he's still winning.

Imagine if the rest of D.C. wanted to #MAGA with him!
Try again, that's now how it works. GOP obstructed Obama and he didn't whine about it. They held up the Merrick nomination and I bet you were okay with that. Maybe Trump should nominate qualified people. Also of he didn't do anything than why worry about the Russian investigation
Wrong, Hillary Clinton was nominated without any problem all his cabinet was nominated without any problems name of the person who GOP had problems with. It’s easy to go back and check

This happened to be on TV now. For Trump to fill all his positions because of the obstructing and delaying it will take over 8 years to fill all his positions.Booker&Finstine both a religious test  which is unconstitutional. Ethics violation.
How many times in the first year does Trump need to fill the same position. GOP has control of all branches
Actually you were wrong all it is is 49 to 50. McCain’s not there besides McCain is a Democrat
And the VP has cast the tie breaker vote every other time. And whose fault is it that people he has in the WH can't get security clearances
‘They are ‘slow walking’ all of my nominations’ Don’t you mean the Kochs nominations? 

‘McConnell aims to reshape courts in case Senate flips’
‘Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400. Here are the tapes’
‘The Trump administration is moving forward on oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’ 
‘Arizona GOP candidate Debbie Lesko copied and pasted bills written by lobbyists’ 

Lobbyists funded by the Kochs. 
‘New poll shows Democrat leading in every Arizona Senate matchup
Kyrsten Sinema is polling ahead of Republicans Martha McSally, Kelli Ward, and Joe Arpaio’ 
Republicans obstructed Obama's administration for years. I don't remember Obama whining like a bitch on Twitter. 
Obama was obstructing America. He was the main reason we are verbally battling. Obama is the first existing president to leave office and start challenging the new POTUS. In my opinion, that's the most disrespectful thing an existing president could do. He got his 8 yrs.
Raise your hand if you can’t WAIT till we get to see what’s in those Michael Cohen documents and tapes?  #BeginningOfTheEnd

I’m feeling comfortable writing in my own language i don’t care what you think
Based on all the horrible, corrupt people you nominate?

Screw democrats
The Democrats want to see America crumble just because they hate President Trump... how could anyone ever vote for them?!
Despite constant obstruction, the Trump administration is making HUGE gains for the American people!

If only you had the house and senate 
No, no. We went legal marijuana in the United States.
Let’s just return the favor on November! And walk the demos right out of office
Hmmm...9 years, you say? Sounds like convenient timing to me...
I, as an American citizen wish to sue the democratic party for obstructing for over a full year, the duties of the current admin. and a duly elected president. Who will represent WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA VS THE DNC/DEMOCRATIC PARTY?
Good luck - unconstitutional?!
Really? Which amendment says so? I don't want to sue my country, just dems and the DNC.
Drain the swamp
So sick of their childish games while the world watches. Dont they(Dems)realize how stupid they really look.They need to get heads out of their asses and start actually earning our tax dollars as their damn pay.this makes me not want to pay taxes to these crooks. #boycotttaxes!
So much for your "jobs, jobs, jobs" promise.
Why are you worrying about it? You'll just fire them any way!!
President Trump please enforce the death penalty for any who is convicted of trying to kill a police officer or kills a police officer.  This killing will never stop if we do not instill fear in these evil people.  Please help
That’s a lie!
That is there job now.
Ryan and McConnell step up and change the rules for vetting nominees
Oh that's right, you are both #NeverTrump
Carry on obstructing our Constitutional Republic
You mean they are going to block the approval of a supreme court justice for 12 months? #sad !
But you only hire the best - not “good”
No one wants to work with or for you. #ETTD
#DISGUSTING

When the senate has not approved, fire the top person until someone you want is “acting” head, even if you have to fire 100 people ahead of the person you want.
Merrick Garland. Google it.
They ought to be ashamed of themselves. And why isn’t Hillary being investigated for election rigging? Remember Bernie?
My good Lord u show daily how stupid and uninformed u are. You lie so much. U don't know crap! Go back to school dirty corrupt Trump!
Can't the nuclear option be used?

What?
Every day I am embarrassed that America chose you to be our president. You are a disgrace to the office. We deserve better.

Oh Donald time to think up some new lies you really have worn out all this garbage!!  Democrats aren’t the obstructionist you are to busy golfing to even appoint anyone not to mention the yugh volume of people leaving !  Loser!

@TheDemocrats how do you sleep at night? You destroy everything u touch. Give @potus what he needs, he’s a good man and u know it.
Hi Donald I know you probably won’t see this but I only joined Twitter to tell you that I think you’re doing a wonderful job, and that I’m counting on you for my future.
Get rid of Nikki Haley, she’s deep state 100%..
She’s definitely #NeonNikki weak on borders Bush template republican I wouldn’t trust her
Amen!!! She needs to go ASAP...
Nikki is the face of war
McCain part II 
Lindsey Graham likely knew John McCain then Nikki the lying immigrant from India Claimed she was white when voted election prior to #Trump She’s untrustworthy
It’s not that I am anti immigrant but at some point we have to say enough is enough & stop allowing foreigners into our gov, Obama, Huma Abadeen, Valerie Jarret, Awan brothers, Mayor of SF (was Chinese), Mayor of LA (was Mexican); i know of no other country that allows this...
So blaming dems u cant hire decent qualified people. Plus u don't vet anyone. People pay for thier jobs. U prove how ur a horrible business person over and over again. Sad, your hate for America shows.
#AmericaThirst #CandyMan
For someone (good Doc) who served two presidents without incident and excellent creds from each, the only conclusion is that Trump brings out the worst in the best people he has working for him.  candyman
There is also the deal when you step out or are pushed into the political arena. Everything in your past good and bad is going to come out. In this case, it was a whole lot of bad. Allegations so far but with something like over 20 independent sources it's not looking good for RJ
If he couldn't handle the heat of these mere allegations and clear his name though the confirmation process, then I have only one thing to say:  He's unfit for the job.
Absolutely! The innocent don't run from confrontation, they crave it imo. But then again, look who's president. The fish does rot from the head...
Agree.  If I was wrongly accused of something, I would welcome the opportunity to clear my name and challenge any of my accusers to prove their BS allegations.  The last thing I would do is run...unless of course, I was guilty.
As usual  this proves how much was reason for me leaving the left side and I will never vote Democrat again! #Obstructionist #Hyprocrits #DemocraticPartyAntiAmerican They Hate This President more then they love America and it’s Peoples!!!! Get the nominations passed now.
Sorry that you’re so disillusioned!
Stop whining.

Grow up.

Put on your big boy pants and be a real President.

This is the way democracy works,  to prevent despots from appointing sycophants who are just as corrupt as they are.

Try not to take it personally.

Unless the shoe fits.
Tweeting the same trash day after day. You've said all this and done nothing because Dems don't agree with you so you say they are the problem. What a crock'o'shit!

Again Trump tries to deflect blame for his sloppy nomination process and his perennial failure to vet nominees selected not for qualifications, but for presumed loyalty.  He promised us the best; he's given us the worst.  It isn't Democrats : it's Trump's incompetence.
2 words: Merrick Garland. Also, your nominees are historically and catastrophically corrupt or otherwise unqualified. #checksAndBalances
Gee, it must be nice living in a fantasy world where every problem is caused by “others”. No need to face the fact that YOUR party is the one slow walking everything because they don’t like your nominations!

Yes sir, it is called "Reap what you sow" and the GOP wrote the playbook during the Obama administration. 

And you supported it then.
Maybe if you picked people that could actually perform the job and weren’t just your rich friends, what an idea right?!?!
No it won’t take nine years. U will be gone by January 2019 and all those positions will be filled by competent people.
Maybe u should resign now and save your own behind from more humiliation.


Anybody out there ok with an abusive drunk, an opioid pusher & a doctor willing to lie to make #Trump seem healthier than he is with ZERO executive experience running one of the largest agencies for 9 million vets? #JonTester did the vetting YOU should have done & you attack.../1
...him? Threaten him? There is something seriously wrong with you. You made a decision without gathering all the facts. You hired someone b/c you liked/trusted them. You didn’t determine if they were qualified. What was in their past. YOU FUCKED UP. Deal with it./2
Wow- you really aren’t bright. You need a majority for your nominees. @gop is ruling party in congress and WH. Look no further than your own party and the fact your nominees are not qualified.
The left is such a waste.
Today Trump told Fox, "I'm very disappointed in my Justice Department" and threatened to interfere in Russia probe. Mr. President, it's not your Justice Department; it belongs to the American people and serves the public interest, not yours. Any interference will not be tolerated
Maybe you should do better background checks on people that you are going to put on your Cabinet. It should be noted that your Cabinet is the biggest revolving door in Presidential history. The White House has been in total chaos since you’ve taken over.
If you picked a qualified nominee with good character and a proven leader, Democrats would be all over it. How hard is that to aim for? It’s what we all want.
Yeah, They'll be sorry when the zombie apocalypse breaks out! Still building your #InsanityDefense I see!
Stop firing people and vet your nominees properly. That will save a ton of time,
Have you ever heard of vetting? You should try it sometime. Preferably before you select someone to hold a high government position. We really don’t appreciate your mob style attempt at leadership.
GOP is In Majority!
They are in Position to Confirm.
Maybe if U sent QUALIFIED lawyers 2B Fed Judges? One neverTried case
Dear @POTUS, you said you don't want to step into the DOJ mix until the #Mueller thing is over. 

What makes us think it'll be over?

Manafort, @GenFlynn, @MichaelCohen212. Who's next? I'm sure there's someone in view. along with extended paychecks.

I don't see it ever ending.
If you vetted your upcoming appointments you would get more support. Experience counts
If you really think about this ,how can it be the Dems when the GOP is in control? It,s your own party "slow walking" your noms because they know you pick the worst people.
You should of listened to the advice Bloomberg gave you??
Vetting has to be done at some point in the process.  If you did adequate vetting upfront, the process would go more smoothly down the line.  Kind of like your "presidency", actually.  The @GOP sure failed their own vetting, didn't they? #MobsterDonald

Is it kinda like when republicans would not even speak to Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a year? And all your nominees are so qualified baaahhhaaaahhaaa
I think of a great way to fast-walk everything.
Arrest every criminal politician aiding and abetting illegal immigration and encouraging illegals to vote. That would be every Democrat. #MartialLawNow
It is because they can't pass. They are not qualified just like you
Of course we all agree with the you 100%. You’re a witch and you’re being hunted, ok?Now could you possibly talk about something that isn’t about YOU? You could try. How about... forgetting the wall for one minute and work hard on your agenda WITHOUT BLAMING ANYONE.
Making it obvious they don't care about our country, only about regaining the power they had before. The left r godless ppl, led by Satan. They're deceived & blind & don't know they're being manipulated by him to do his will. They'd rather our country burn than DJT succeed.

Maybe if you nominated some people who are actuallly qualified and not diametrically oposed to the mission of the departments they would be heading. Maybe that. #BestPeople #VeryStableGenius #MAGA #Meltdown #WorstPresidentEverByFarTremendous
Maybe @realDonaldTrump your criteria should not be: willing to lie about my weight.
Then stop funding them.  Figure out how to fight back.
Since the noms are happening in the Senate, make Mitch lock the doors and force a weekend of processing...by the dims rules. Either speak up or send them through. Gotta get those entrenched deep staters out!
@WayTown1111 
Mr. President, thank you, worked all 3 of your properties in A.C., back in in the day when you ran them successfully. Plenty of latins, blacks, gay waiters were a dime a dozen. As a white man I was a minority, I know there's alot of ppl that know same facts. Thank you for MAGA!
Other people ran them into the ground, call them out from the bully pulpit someday, you set them up for success, they failed, shame on them.
well said, patriot!!

You were slow to nominate people.

You nominated people who are the Dolores Umbridge of their field.

43% of your people quit or were fired.

This is all your own fault.
‘Treason’
Shame on McConnell for not helping you. He could get it done. @SenateMajLdr
Trump tends appoint faulty candidates because a bird of a feather tend to flock together.
Well, if you would recommend qualified people, maybe things would work out for you. Most people learn from their mistakes, but not #DonTheCon
If you typed that tweet, and still didn’t had an ‘ah-ha’ moment, you’re a bigger moron than I thought.
That’s because you refuse to do a proper job of vetting candidates.
Your choices of the “best and brightest” is proven to be an ongoing list of firings. You started this with defamation of oppression  and Obama’s policies #ComeyInterview #indictments #MuellerIsComing #choen #FoxAndFriends #CNN

You added Scott Pruitt to the Swamp!! How many lobbyist go in the sound proof booth a week? $43,000 American tax dollars spent to make secret deals with lobbyists in a private booth.. Then they should head for the confession booth..

Extreme vetting is needed to fill the swamp!
Nominate decent people vetted properly and quit putting up these chumps. Remember the judicial nominees that barely knew procedures and doctrines.
You obstruct justice.

PLEASE LIST THESE GREAT NOMINATIONS THAT ARE BEING OBSTRUCTED.  IT'S A SHAME REALLY.  LIKE WHEN MERRICK GARLAND FOR EXAMPLE, A MOST QUALIFIED JUDGE/SUPREME COURT NOMINEE COULDN'T EVEN GET A VOTE.
You keep putting up inexperienced and unqualified people.
The system in place for vetting cabinet positions is no different from the one previous presidents used. It worked for them then and it is not working for you because you do not have the skill set & knowledge to perform the job.
Try vetting your selections so you don’t pick a heavy drinking/pill pusher; a wife beater; liars; arrogant divas spending taxpayers money faster than they would their own.  And WHO is the military staff member HOOKED on PERCOCET?

Have you considered nominating some qualified candidates who won't have a scandal a day if confirmed? YOUR SCANDALS ARE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. WE CAN'T TAKE MORE SCANDALOUS PEOPLE. QUOTA OFFICIALLY FILLED ON GOVT SCANDALS UNTIL THE YEAR 3000
So much winning Spanky! 
And let's not forget the behavior of these Democrats. The GOP has better have a long memory like Nikki Haley & remember each and every obstructionist Dem. Don't let the little ones hide behind the big ones!
Democrats are doing this on behalf of the American people! It is their job to vet these people.

As witnessed (by the ones they don't have power to control) you do NOT hire the best people

Also missed your outrage when Repubs STOLE a SCOTUS seat by "slow-walking" Merrick Garland
Democrats are working with the . We are seeing the corruption Obama did while in office (8years) never seen anything like it before. It can now be seen that Obama hated America#MAGA#TrumpsAmerica #Trump8years

Try VETTING them first and perhaps they can get confirmed.

Or appoint someone QUALIFIED like Merick Garland!

I'm ok with that. You're people suck or get fired or get indicted.

Boy, if you think these people are the best, you definitely shouldn't be in office.
Justice was served.  Here's hoping America catches the next one!
It is the white Houses job to Vet these nominees, which you are not doing, just because you say someone is a very fine man does not make it true, and we have learned when you say something usually the exact opposite is true
Because you have continually put people into positions that are unqualified.  DeVos, Carson, Pruitt, Hicks,  Bridenstien...just to name a few!!!  You said you know the "best people".  You know the worst people!!!!
