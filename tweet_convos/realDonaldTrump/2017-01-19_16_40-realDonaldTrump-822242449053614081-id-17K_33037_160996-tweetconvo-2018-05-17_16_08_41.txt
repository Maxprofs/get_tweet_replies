Drifting Towards Unparalleled Disaster..

Thank you we LOVE YOU her in KENTUCKY
I just can't stop laughing 
Didn't watch but the KKK said it was lit.
The kkk are Democrats so you would know.  @realDonaldTrump
is the Lincoln Memorial behind you shaking his head? Looks like it from here.
it was great thank you very much and please tell your lovely wife how proud we are to have her as our beautiful FLOTUS..
Less then 24 hrs until a truly monumental event! Your supporters are so proud that you will be OUR President! #MAGA
Let me guess, the crowd was "HUGE". Just wait until Saturday.
we are going to miss you on tweeter. God watch over you and your family.
I heard you had only about 10k people? How does it feel to suck so bad?
It was wonderful! Watched it on the internet!
Beautiful and powerful!! Loved every moment.
More people at Trump Tower protesting. @realDonaldTrump
.@realDonaldTrump Angel, tonight you said nobody has ever had an important concert at the Lincoln Memorial before.
3 Doors Down did an awesome job. The real question is "Why @bakedalaska? Why?"
but you call those MUSICIANS?  Whoa!  Too bad you couldn't get any good ones.
@DonaldJTrumpJr where is son Melania and Trump have together.Did he stay in ny city where he wants to stay?Test tomorrow
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
3 doors down was awesome. I forgot how great the song Kryptonite is.

thank u PE God Bless U
Roy Cohn is saving a nice hot place for you in HELL.
We  You!

@IvankaTrump 
@KellyannePolls 

T -Minus  10 HOURS and COUNTING...
I'm sure we can all agree that there is no other place we would rather live.
Thank you for talking to "we the people" in your tweets, you make me proud! I look forward to America being great again.
You're going to make America a laughing stock.

My heart hurts I hope that the Obama family really knows how much we love them. We don't have the vocabulary to tell it all
Passing of the torch !
A big thanks to all the performers at the concert tonight. Great show!
we are honored by your presence Mr. President
I heard this live in 2007! If God be for him, who can stand against him!

#TrumpFraud #MAGA #TrumpTrain  #PUTINGATE #TrumpleThinSkin #TheResistance #TreasonousTrump #TrumpTrainCRASH @Rosie 
no we dont... Worst president ever... Armed jihadists in syria and libya... But to dumb to see it
.@realDonaldTrump Sorry that you had a drop of 97.5% in attendance compared to Barack Obama's inaugural concert!!
like Trump has ever worked a day in his life
.@realDonaldTrump Funny, no crowd pictures. Here. 10k for you 400k for Obama
@naughtywriter2 @realDonaldTrump not a fair comparison. Blacks were taught Trump wants them in bondage.
.@AllInFunTx @naughtywriter2  I & many other Whites are embarrassed/angry at the hate @realDonaldTrump spewed to get elected #BadForAmerica
but, not angry at the hate and division spread over the past 8 years?
.@AllInFunTx @naughtywriter2 @realDonaldTrump you mean spread by #RWNJ's alt-Right neo-Nazis & White Supremacists lead by Oligarchs? Yup
like calling for the execution of police? Like spreading lies that Rep keep them in inner cities?
Some major assholes on both sides. Sad for your willful ignorance about what Obama preached.
My willful ignorance? You assume I even voted for him.
Who are you kidding? No one was there!! Lol 400,000 for @BarackObama! He is a REAL winner & legitimate president.
Thanks Mr President/ Trump together you and We the People will Make Our Country Great Again!
God Bless the United States of America.
Ivanka rocks green the bestest

sorry such a lie turnout. Inauguration was pitiful attendance to. Just post Obama pics from 2009 say it was yours.
@tubuyakkyy トランプ大統領は、今までの弱々しい善人のアメリカから脱却し、力強い世界のリーダーになると言ってるだけだよね？
Thank you ahead of time
lovely
I'd like to see things from your point of view but I can't get my head that far up my ass
@VeteransTake please turn border patrol and ICE and police loose on these people use the national guard to God help us

Thank you President Trump and we love your humor
What's the difference between you and a brick? The brick gets laid.
Everybody wants to know what was in the little blue box from Tiffany's ?

any real man would be proud for a fam. like yours. bill F.D.N.Y.
@EricTrump

Feed private sector
beautiful family Mr. President
Yo momma's so fat the escape velocity at her surface exceeds 3.0x108 m/s
I hope you meant that for everyone! All races,cultures, genders and economic backgrounds.
Those fireworks were boring! Did you see Japan's New Years fireworks? Made this look like some backyard toy fireworks.
Looks like somebody is jealous
@shortman5427 If America becomes great again everyone will benefit if US foreign policies change. No external interference.
@POTUS Congratulations

I hear when you were a child your mother wanted to hire somebody to take care of you, but the mafia wanted too much.

Do you have to leave so soon? I was just about to poison the tea.
GOD BLESS AMERICA  AND GOD BE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ALL OF US!!!!!!!!!!!!
