Lift the #JonesAct. Stop purposely denying #PuertoRicoRelief and aid it needs. #HelpPuertoRico #PuertoRico
Well, Donnie's would be "Fifty Shades of Stupid," so there's that.
I have family in Puerto Rico, & to a man and woman they thank God that it is YOU - Mr. President - & not Her Heinous who is in charge #MAGA
That damn ocean is just in the way of aid. If only we had invested billions in a Navy to help
A bit uninformed r we?  Aid has arrived.  Gov.  Of PR  already praised Pres. Trump for the quick response... need false complaint?
The leftists on this feed ought to ask the long-suffering Haitian people what they think about the Clintons and their sham charity.

Hillary, after stealing the aid money raised for the people of Haiti, it might be best if you keep your comments to yourself. #NotRelevant https://twitter.com/Truthseeker126/status/912765746337468416 …

God bless our US Coast Guard and all the men and women in uniform helping in this massive relief effort - and God bless our POTUS. #MAGA
AMEN... AND ALWAYS!
More like prey on them.
Or grab all their land and build one of his  hotels.  Disgraceful.

You didn't even know Puerto Rico was part of this country until today it seems.
Listen to what Hillary has to say.
Please just stop tweeting already.

here here!
I bet you would kneel seeing how your probably used to being on your knees

So now u side with North Korea
In thinking Trump is a dotard? Yeah. Most of the world does.
Yet you didn’t know what dotard meant till rocket Pokémon man said it
Bot!
I, was referring to Brower Strong @bcstrong031
After you rant about the #NFL?
That too. I'm not sure he was convinced that they actually were Americans. They didn't vote for him


That was biggest laugh so far today!!
But Puerto Rico will be included in his new travel ban. Can't have all of those Mexicans from Puerto Rico coming here. Build Atlantic wall.

THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT!
WE BELIEVE IN YOU!
PRES Trump: electoral map--2020.
got trump?
Pres Trump: Please support Gold Star MOMS!
THANKS!!!
Like the one he insulted during the campaign? And her husband? Great idea!!
Wait, I thought our hearts and prayers were with the flag?
Isn’t the NFL our top priority?
Yes our hearts are. Your's is not
Sociopaths cannot feel emotion.  He is a monster.
Actually that's psychopaths. sociopaths feel emotion, they just don't care! And we know he just don't care!
Are u a psychologist, counselor or psychiatrist?
Are you?
Technically, I failed a podcast quick test. However, having family & friends who are Puerto Rican and from the V.I. I can't sit this 1 out
I hope your family and friends are safe. They are in my prayers, along with everyone in #PuertoRico and #USVI
Thank you
But the Atlantic Ocean...it’s so yuuuuge. 

Mr. President, the Dems' myth-making factory ("the Media"), may try to smear the US response, but Puerto Ricans appreciate the massive ...
relief effort underway. I know. My family on the island tells me.  Daily.They see the huge pallets   of aid right behind Juan's asshat mayor
No one is being fooled; they know who the real trouble makers are - the leaders on the island, not the men and women from FEMA, Navy, etc.
U.S. denies request for Puerto Rico shipping waiver. What could be more important then human life.  Oh life!

Nothing like having your finger on the pulse and reacting to such a tragedy so quickly Donald. Go down on one knee for that.
He goes down on two for Putin
You mean "before Putin" and nothing you say about the Clintons takes away Trump's self-interests with Russia. It's Mueller Time!
God Bless Trump  God Bless America
Your image is disrespecting the U.S. flag. Better check the Flag Code. Just google it. Simple enough.
By impeachment of Conservatives
Trump is making Russia great again  https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnhudson/us-and-russia-quietly-end-diplomatic-tailspin …
And he even makes the world sympathetic to NK now
Working hard to ruin US leadership
While Japan fears it can be nuked at any moment, within minutes' notice
tRump says the NFL protest is disgraceful. I say plowing a car into a group of pedestrians, killing & maiming is worse. #taketheknee @POTUS
But see, it's different because a white guy did that.  The NFL players are African American, and Donny wants to keep them suppressed.
Seen plenty of whites taking a knee. It's not about race, it's about respecting the military

When nfl fines players for celebrating a TD but doesn't show respect to flag, it's just anti-American.


I love me some #WandaSykes!
Me too
Resign. #racist
Is Ted scratching his left nipple?
Haha! It sure looks that way!

More than a day late: by 9/18 PR had Cat 4 Maria headed toward it, after Irma damage. Closer to 8 days late ...
And what do you do? You wait over a week to even address them & then have the loathsome audacity to BLAME THEM for their dire situation.
Did Trump ever address the marines killed and Navy sailors who drown? I don't recall seeing their Commander-In-Chief say anything.
As my senior memory recalls, he mumbled something about the sailors and whether or not the ship still had internet. Really weird statement.
He can't speak in complete sentences. I can't stand to listen to him. I hadn't seen anything on my news feed.
NEWSFLASH: "The People of #PuertoRico" are US citizens. Why are you giving USVI preference? Is it because you own a mansion there?
Duh  And because his business in PR went bankrupt and he left them devastated!

Hey nobody. Rather humorous to see notification that read "nobody liked your tweet". I swear I chuckled. Excellent Twitter Name 
Freedom isn't free -- that's why we citizens protest Trump.
#ImpeachTrump
Did you make TX & FL share FEMA relief? No. They were individually appropriated. Why are you lumping USVI w Puerto Rico?
His geography teacher failed him. He thinks they're joined by a bridge & belong to Spain.
The @NFL is dead to me!


To be fair, I think he was just told today that Puerto Ricans are US citizens. #PuertoRico
and it's an island in a "really big" ocean
#USSComfort Is still docked off of Virgina...when it finally leaves it'll take almost a week to get there. People are dying & you don't care
There are only deck crew assigned. It takes about two weeks to man up and get underway.
But with all the forecasts citing almost certain devastation, why weren’t they prepping long before this?
Unclear. Apparently Donald thought they were Mexican Democrats who would would disappear mysteriously on their own, like Atlantis.
The World is watching Mr PRESIDENT, stay the course you are making an impact for the better!!
No More APOLOGIES! #MAGA 
The world is watching and wondering when @realDonaldTrump will actually do something that benefits the American people
The day he leaves office
Idea: Let's start helping Puerto Rico by YOU paying them the $30M you owe them, you grifter. https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2017/03/20/puerto-rico-trump-bankruptcy-golf-course/ …
#TrumpRussia
They are worried that there might be a mass immigration to the US mainland and people might abandon their homes in puerto Rico
Just wait. Trump's going to try to build a wall around Puerto Rico now!
PR is a beautiful country!
People just don't know anything. It's sad to read what illiterate people write on social media. Scary!
Why we need to keep the toe to toe with snowballs!  They can never handle the real!
Wes, Wes, Wes. PR is not "a beautiful country." It's a US territory.  Its residents are US citizens. Jeez.
Well, technically it is a country. We have our own government and constitution. But yes, it also is a territory (colony) of the US.
Every state has its own govt and const too. But states aren't sovereign nations. Neither is PR. But most people there are brown so trump...
Thank you. This was needed. Don't forget about PR.
Navy already on the way to help!!
And our boys in the Coast Guard and Fire Department
That's nice and all, but WHEN THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING TO SEND FOOD, WATER & MEDICAL SUPPLIES, ASSHOLE? PUERTO RICO NEEDS HELP NOW!
Stop praying and send ships.
Prayers? But you are an atheist...how does that preying work?

this made my birthday even better 
Happy Birthday 
Ayyy cheers mate 
Even more unconscionable is the fact that YOU YOURSELF are responsible for $33 million of their debt from your failed golf course there!
How can we possibly help when it's in the middle of a big ocean?
He’s going to be mad as hell when he finds out that the Pacific Ocean is between us and North Korea.

You're a Snowflake ..!
You have made your disdain for Puerto Rico abundantly clear by neglecting their existence for over a week then victim blaming them.
LOL, dotard if you really did give a shit about Puerto Rico you would have acted a week ago.
In typical trump fashion, a day late and a dollar short.
Just heard u're sending #usnscomfort, Donald! TY! Wld u plz view this? Compelling! Mr.President, u're the one who can give necessary orders
No more Executive Mulligans for Trump! @POTUS is engaging in simple revisionism for victim blaming the survivors of a devastating hurricane.
 Comrade Manafort's secrets are lurking in the #TrumpRussia background 
...please, can you make @FEMA_Brock deliver power generators to hospitals?
Most people are killed by people they know/familiar 
This applies to every "race". 
So all "races" would have the same problem. 

As a European I feel ashamed for u & everyone who voted for you. That inferieur feeling towards ppl who think/feel/believe different. Bleh.
When u compare it with our history we are yes :).  Glad our different cultures found a way to work together. Usa under Trump is a shame
We also recall your last mention of Puerto Ricans was to use them as scapegoats & bargaining chips for your disastrous GOP budget proposal.
you are so full of shit...your heart and prayers are with some bullshit fury about the NFL and the national anthem.Fuck off
#PuertoRico has
no power
no fuel
no water
no food
no roads
PEOPLE ARE DYING

WAIVE #TheJonesAct
to save their lives
Shipping industry supports #JonesAct b/c it's protectionist. #PuertoRico deserves better than policy decisions driven by special interests.
Puerto Rico, which is a country to 3.4 MILLION American citizens is in a humanitarian crisis. They have no power & dwindling food & water.
Did you know DT Puerto Ricans are citizens?? Like Rosie Perez says supplies should have been there to help day ONE!! Do something Trump
Sad to see the mayor of San Juan cry on TV because of the humanitarian crisis her city is facing. Your words don't match your actions. Liar.
Mayor Cruz is in the streets going door 2 door talking 2 ppl giving hope. Failed fake @potus could take service & humility lessons from her.

Donald Trump blocks Congressmen from traveling to Puerto Rico so they can’t see how badly he’s blown it http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/blocks-pr-trump/5167/ …
Hearts and prayers aren't enough. Why won't you waive the Jones Act? It was waived for Texas and Florida. Why not Puerto Rico?
Stop flittering back to things that mean nothing, like sports. Do your damn job! Only thing on your mind this morning should be #PuertoRico
hearts and prayers aren’t enough — send them HELP and RESOURCES, you selfish asshat
I think I like you more with every tweet.
meanwhile, i hate @realDonaldTrump more with every tweet
When are you going to actually be a leader and DO something to help Americans of Puerto Rico. I'm disgusted with lack of action. 1/2
Shipping companies won't like letting foreign ships deliver supplies. So what? You are president & PR needs help. #TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Are you sending the money you owe them for your bankrupt golf course?

Puerto Rico needs water, food, medicine, clothing and shelter ..NOT "our prayers"
Another Trump failure cost Puerto Rico $33M.
Lift the Jones Act so they can get help from as many people who WANT to help!! Worst President in History #ImpeachTrump
@KnucklDraginSam god bless potus Trump if you want something done ! go to a busy man ! Praying for wisdom & energy !
Will you push for repeal of the Jones Act, which keeps Puerto Rico from receiving goods from nearby islands and increases shipping costs?
I suggest you turn on CBS and see the reality in Puerto Rico. It's a mess, and people are dying.
Then #LiftTheJonesAct
Wall Street Got a Bailout, Why Not Puerto Rico?
The man said it, the man means it, more help on the way, hang tough Puerto Rico and Vigin isalands
Then lift the #JonesAct! Why lift it for Florida and Texas but not Puerto Rico?While you’re at it, pay PR the 33 million you owe them! #BUM
George Bush loves how you're making him look great again!
Paying them the money you owe them could go a long way in the rescue relief efforts in #PuertoRicoRelief
Yet you both embarrass America by doing nothing
How about waive the #JonesAct ?  #WaiveTheJonesAct
Don't need hearts, prayers or your visit. Get more bodies here, lift the Jones Act, and quit whining about pro sports.
Fill military planes w equipment & personnel & get them to PR before you are responsible for the genocide of an island of Americans. DO IT!
“Hearts and prayers”?? They need DRINKING WATER & FOOD.
And yet no waiver of #JonesAct . Why bother with this #FakeTweet
Too little too late. Go back to playing golf and tweeting. Btw your bankrupt in PR so you owe $30million to them. Time to cough up.
You are an epic failure
McCain; "Dpt of Homeland Sec has been given the ability to waive the Jones Act...and has done so twice in the last month"
Stop praying, you phony Christian, and start doing something. Like waive or repeal the #JonesAct.
Together. But in reality you are very alone in your http://position.Best  regards from Switzerland
please help me get my sister from Patillas, PR to Tampa for stage 4 liver and lung cancer medical care
Please, Please HELP, if anyone can do this, it's you...
They need HELP not to be CRITISIZED at,even from a President they are AMERICAN,S on this island as well
This Puerto Rican voted for you .. Thank you for your support .. I'm so scared for the people, my family ... PLEASE Mr President Trump 
Sorry, Sandy. Puerto Rico is too brown for Donnie's tastes. Your family voted for a racist bigot. #TrumpsKatrina
I just heard from people in Puerto Rico...they are fighting and stealing for their life. They need to evacuate the whole island.
People from Barbuda that got wiped out went to Puerto Rico so we have them to worry about as well. I don't care if they are not citizens...
These are human beings in need of help ASAP.
Just heard from Puerto Rico again...a gallon of water goes for $5. They are in need of batteries...at night it is pitch black.
This isn't just @realDonaldTrump ....this is a disaster of the entire @GOP gop.

Get LOUDER MEDIA...........
C U Next Tuesday, Trump!
Only way to get "through" it is by mobilizing aid, troops and man power NOW! 3 million Americans are suffering with no food & water
We don't want prayer, WE WANT RELIEF!  Abolish the #JonesAct now! #PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoStrong #PuertoRicoSeLevanta @realDonaldTrump
Hearts & prayers do not feed the starving & homeless!!!You need instructions from Hillary!! While you golf & tweet people die! Not a leader!
Hearts and prayers will not fill the generators with diesel and fill water bottles. Plus, you don't have a heart.
As #Trump brags about his tremendous help to #PuertoRico he still refuses to lift shipping restrictions needed NOW.
@KnucklDraginSam its like the Africans in America you'll never please the haters ! They just thrive on hate
Hearts and prayers don't do them a damn bit of good. They need ships and planes. It's not really TOGETHER if you let them struggle alone.

This, America, is your choice of President. Seriously??? 
Hillary or Barack would have sent help to Puerto Rico in a heartbeat. Luckily, you followed Hillary's advice about the medical ship, but far too late. You were too busy bullying NFL and John McCain to help American citizens. History will treat you as you treat others.
You in Alabama stumping for loser Luther Strange and tweeting at the NFL while Puerto Rico is suffering, 40% of people don't have water.
PR needs more than prayers. Suspend the Jones Act, as you did for TX & FL. Or are they too brown for you to care? https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/second-class-puerto-rico-1506467376 …
the people of puerto rico were trumps biggest enemys... they spoke very bad about you in the elections....Puerto rico is over 90% democrats.
You could really show your support by waving the Jones Act like you did for victims of Harvey and Irma.  Puerto Ricans are Americans too.
The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico crying on TV because of deaths caused by a dithering chain of command.  YOU, sir.
"I know that leaders aren't supposed to cry...But we are having a humanitarian crisis here," San Juan mayor tells @DavidBegnaud 
When are you going to send aid to Puerto Rico?  You are killing American citizens!  #GetHimOut!
Ummmm, explain this
You tweeted 23 times about #NFL and only 6 times about #PuertoRicoRelief SHAME ON YOU!
You haven't mentioned US Virgin Islands need for aid, they are in dire need also. Guess what, there are many voters that will remember this.
Didn't you ever learn timing is e everything?  (In deals, politics and LIFE) Once again, too little too late.
THEY DONT NEED HEARTS AND PRAYERS THEY NEED FOOD AND FUCKING WATER DO SOMETHING

But the "shipping industry" doesn't want the Jones act lifted. Therefore you are letting 3.5 Million Americans suffer. #horriblepresident
Except you put constraints on any help via making them pay full fare 2 evacuate, not sending help in time. Blood on your hands.
When?!?!
If only we had a navy or airplanes or some other resources that we could give beyond hearts and prayers.  Oh well, let's go yell at the NFL.
Puerto Rico needs help ... not hearts and prayers! We know it is an ISLAND, THANKS FOR TELLING US THAT CONSTANTLY. NOW HELP THEM DOTARD BOY!
You're doing a heck of a job Donnie!
You're doing a heck of a job Verm!
puerto rico is asking for help from trump for the hurricane. after they kissed hillarys ass during the elections.  PR is over 90% democratic
Ya can't eat thoughts & prayers .....por favor
Hearts 
Prayers 
Water 
Food 
Power 
Shelter 
Cell service 
2 out of 7 is about @potus average
Yeah the free ones. GOP all about hopes and prayers. Doesn't affect their pockets
Are you aware that Puerto Rican's ARE Americans?
You horrible man. Puerto Ricans are utterly desperate. You can and should do much more, but you are too self-obsessed.
You're doing a heck of a job Donnie.

@SenJohnMcCain continues to be more presidential than you. Suspend Jones Act--more effective than your fake prayers.
It's unacceptable @DHSgov denied #JonesAct waiver for #PuertoRico. I sent a letter urging the dept to change course. https://www.reuters.com/article/storm-maria-puertorico-shipping/update-1-u-s-denies-request-for-puerto-rico-shipping-waiver-idUSL2N1M72EK …
Something has to be done immediately. Tweeting about every situation is not a solution. @therealDonaldTrump
how about immediate tactical steps to help? F$ck your hearts and prayers.
Your not doing Shit Mr. fucken president. the entire island needs help. You are stopping ships from bring in help. have you even seen PR yet
When are you going to step in to ensure the supplies reach them then???    They need help!!!!
Together? Parted by Donald Jail Trump who know best how to seperate Americans into hate groups.
#TheResistance
If you care about #PuertoRicoRelief then waive the #JonesAct @DHSgov
please do all that you can for Puerto Rico. These people are going to die. It is not fair ... http://tmi.me/1fjIGE 
Someone finally explained to you:
1 - Puerto Rico is America
2 - They VOTE in American elections
3 - Planes can fly over water
CONGRATS!
Even more than your fake prayers, #PuertoRico needs trucks and drivers to distribute aid from port.
Maddening. 
3,000 shipping containers packed with food water & medicene have been sitting at the port in Puerto Rico since Saturday 
Flint, Michigan isn't an island with limited access. They've had no potable water since 2014.
Stop the White Supremacist BS immediately.
Waive the Jones Act, smart guy.
How about paying Puerto Rico back the 33 million dollar bond you screwed them on with your failed golf course. That would be a great start.
Why'd it take so long to even mention them?Your delay has probably turned Florida bright blue. 

People are MOVING to MAINLAND-PERMANENTLY.
Children and elderly are suffering terribly in PR. Lift the Jones act now so aid can get in! These are American citizens!
People are dying in #PuertoRico. They need more than prayers--they need you to ACT.
https://twitter.com/UniteAlbertans/status/912963649504808960 …
It would help if you would move beyond self-aggrandizing rhetoric and bust some ass to get action on the ground in Puerto Rico. Crisis Mode
At least he realized that they are Americans... or did he?
well we can also ask them if they do think they are americans. It 's another question.
lol Sad but too true! God knows they embody none of America's values, traditions or constitution (pun intended)!
2/2 the additional almost 90 million due to hurricane Maria also he can't just forgive 33 million dollars himself so learn the facts #MAGA
STOP TALKING AND GET THOSE SHIPPMENTS OUT TO THE PPL, FEMA KEEPS TURNING AWAY DONATIONS AND LIFT THE DAMN JONES ACT!!! Your all talk!! 
Waive the #JonesAct. Waive the #JonesAct. Waive the #JonesAct .
you weren't worried about them until NOW - you were to busy with the NFL - why don't you #TakeAKnee

Trump has a problem with Puerto Rico’s ‘massive debt’ – but $33 million of it came from his failed golf course there 
They don't need prayers, they need goods & services.. something you had the power to make happen, but you denied. Because-they're an island?
How about cutting them a break?  This is CRAP:

#PuertoRico and #USVI don't need prayers. They need power & water before people start dying.
Texas Debt is $272 Billion
Florida Debt is $180 Billion
Puerto Rico Debt is $73 Billion

Trump insults Puerto Rico... during a disaster.
You tweet this as if u care. We all know ur teeets are bs and lies!! Words mean nothing. ACTIONS DO! HELP PUERTO RICO  DONT TALK ABOUT IT!
Puerto Rico needs gas and diesel to transport supplies and food.  What are you doing to ensure this gets done?
How about sending support?
Are we? Let’s act more and say less
Are they really after you dissed them?
