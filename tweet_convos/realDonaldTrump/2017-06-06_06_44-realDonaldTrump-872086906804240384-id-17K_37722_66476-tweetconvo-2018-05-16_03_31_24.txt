Not Syria? Are you sure? Can not be!

So, Jared needed a billion dollars and played you.
The stinking smell of Qatari was revealed and their dirty nakedness revealed. Here is the Iranian terrorist criminal Qasem Suleimani, who is proudly placed by Qatari on their cars, and they are proud of this terrorist.
This is a strong evidence that Doha support terrorism

J. Kushner 'tried and failed to get a $500m loan from Qatar before pushing Trump to take hard line against country'. Conflicts of interest?
Make a deal and plug us corporate tax loop holes. If you earn a profit in the US give back!
Get back to your roots Mr. President, try some common sense, for a change.
We are the terrorist. We went to countries to back who? The corporations with financial interests, is that who we fight for?

Are U really this ignorant? Trump did't make the list of 'countries of concern' dumdum, that was Obama long BEFORE Trump elected.#TravelBan
#Trump did not ban Qatar #MuslimBan #TravelBan #TuesdayThoughts
The root of terrorism is Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
12bn$ f15 deal?? Oh yea may b the extremists need a strong airforce.
انت ودولتك اكبر ارهابين
You can't end terrorism. It has no one country or leader. Best to keep our nose out of things overseas. Focus on home.
how about women's rights? Driving? Ha?!
دروغ گو گو بخور تا قتی که امثال تو از تروریست حمایت میکنن . مشکل تروریست حل نخواهد شد . روز قدس نشانت میدهیم وقتی همه به خیابان ها آمدیم .
Gas will be supplied by qatar via silk road to china.usa is like escada.its finished
Yeah isolating one county as the problem instead of addressing the global underlying systemic injustices that create terrorism will work
Mr President, Am greatful for the job you are doing
I D I O T  ! Bin  Laden was Saudîarabian ! Not qatarian ! You have been corrupted by the 380 billion$ of Saudi contracts !
White guy plowed into Muslims in London. When will you put a stop to it?
Seriously you don't know what you're  doing, do you.
you do realize we have one of the largest military bases in the Middle East in Qatar right? Silly me...no..you don't know
Way to continue to show your allegiance to #Russia.
If by "terrorism" you mean your presidency, may the end come quickly.
Or maybe, you are just gonna blow some shit up because you are angry about the DOJ interview with Jared. Your deflection is transparent.

#Qatar
Qatar is terrorized by Saudi Arabia. You just gave them over $100 million. Makes you a terrorist.
What do you have to say about Israels 400 illegal nuclear weapons?
#Isis #Daesh  #Al_Qaida #ModerateRebels etc are all made and funded by America and it's allies. Blaming Qatar is just an excuse to hide Y.S!
@ABZayed  there is no terrorist came from Qatar ..  people know the source of it... but I think already they paid 
انتم اصل التطرف والارهاب 
يا اخو الكحبه 
Just to remind u, Qatar brought sergeant Bergadhl back to US while 15 Saudis and 2 from UAE caused one of the worst memory in US history9/11
@realDonaldTrump is going to "end terrorism" by selling 12b of fighter jets to those who he says 'fund terrorism'?  Please explain.
Didn't you just sell them $15 Billion dollars in military hardware? #hypocrite
never to late,to fight terrorism. but, plans and action on the ground !
إحذر من قطر 
الآن يخططون على اغتيالك 
قطر دوله عاهرة 
بقيادة موزه التى تعتبر العقل المدبر للشر في العالم
انتبه
ف قطر ستفعل كل شيء لاغتيالك
Went to Saudi Arabia sold weapons. 
Saudi threatened Qatar with US weapons.
Sold weapons to Qatar also. 
War Begins!
Business Successful.
We need to pray hardier
and after fews days you sells them weapons? What is wrong with you?schizophrenia? psychopathy? Or you are a big joker?
Be careful with Middle East affairs. Try to get as much expert advice as possible.
.@realDonaldTrump SO WHY ARE YOU NOW SELLING THEM ARMS?????
If you think Qatar supports terrorism, why do the US sell F-15 jets to Qatar? Do you want to support terrorism too?
Or do you just have no idea what is going around in your country? Btw Saudi Arabia supports terrorism too.
translation: I have no clue how the world works


Nothing says in bed with terrorism like The US Arms Seals $12 Billion F-15 With Qatar Amid Your Gulf Created Crisis
Take that, Qatar! Feel the wrath of the Trump. US Sells Qatar $12 Billion in Fighter Jets
It's fucking double moralNo way! You can not state that Quatar is supporting terrorism and selling fighter jets to it some days after!
Qatar signs $12 billion deal to buy F-15 jets from U.S.
تلحس طيزي أنت واياه
And now you are selling weapons to a terrorist supporting nation?You are really FAKE#realDonaldTrump#
But you just sold 12B$ of arms to Qatar. Any comment?
And yet you now sell them arms? The alternate reality you live in will be the end of us all. #Resign #NotNormal
Well, ain't that something?
Qatar signs $12 billion deal to buy F-15 jets from U.S. http://reut.rs/2srOqDJ  
But let's sell them weapons! @US_Stratcom
Are you kidding me?
Trumpmp sells Qatar $12 billion of U.S. weapons days after accusing it of funding terrorism http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-sells-qatar-12-billion-arms-days-after-accusing-it-of-funding-terrorism/ …
So you sell them jets? That's a bit stupid isn't it?
If Qatar is major supporter of extremism, and you sell $12 billion in jets to them, aren't you then also supporting & funding extremism??
yeah and now it will all be pointing at you the new leader of local racist extremist
Doubtless Mohamed Bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi financier of terrorism in Arabic countries and in most parts of the world.
Are you aware that your government sold Qatar 12 billions dollars worth of weapons just this morning?
Then why did you just sell them $12B in arms? You're such a loser donny. The biggest phony ever to con the American public. #Impeach45

Donald Trump sold Qatar $12bn of weapons the day after accusing it of funding terrorism http://ind.pn/2rtIif7 
Yess

Hehehe, man! This is the beginning of #Islamic #extremism in the West.Stop dreaming, back to reality
There u go with those alternative facts again.To end terrorism u must address the individuals malcontent.
It's Pakistan, Saudi, Kuwait and Iran that's harboring terrorists
Please explain to the world: You brand Qatar terrorist supporters, then sell $12 billion worth of fighter jets to them?@WhiteHouse @POTUS 

Blah blah blah...so you sell jets to them! Sooo #tough on #terror! #fuckdonaldtrump!
Maybe not-we just agreed to sell them $12 billion in F-15s...maybe a little bit hypocritical?  Sounds very, very bad Mr. President.
Remember my words.. you won't destroy our Arab Nation.. you are not stronger than Allah; than Islam .. we all with Qatar
That's maybe why you punished them by signing a $ 12B missile deal. Such a #FAKE president
Excuse me if you are right you must be proud of yourself by selling #Qatar #F15 for 12 billion.
I am 4 you mr president
And 9 days later you've just closed a $12bn arms sale to Qatar? How does that work then?
B LOVK ME
https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-14/qatar-said-to-sign-deal-for-u-s-f-15s-as-gulf-crisis-continues …
Your Pentagon is selling weapons to terrorist
Why did you and your family take so much money from these "horrible extremists"? Hypocrite. All for the mighty dollar.
Well, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Happy birthday old man you my president
I just want to say how disgusted I am at the so called American people and I pray everyday for strength and peace for you family #lovetrump
You do realise that Qatar is a US ally, right? And that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of terror?
This made it seem like you don't care about the military at all. There are 11,000 troops here. They need you to back them up, not endanger
As an American in Qatar I do wish you'd knock it off. Get educated. Then tweet.
I feel like you have no idea what you're talking about and you're embarrassing all of us.
Send troops mr. President...we need to put a stop to isis....our troops our the best in the world.....
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. - Yoda
Why did no US media report this?
Good jawb Agent Orange. Now could you look into Israel? They appear to have killed thousands of Palestinians and stolen all their land.
Qatar never tolerates terrorism.
US and Saudi Arabia conspiracy will not succeed to destroy Qatar
Bull-  #slipperysaudis are the true extremists.  the 9/11 hijackers were SAUDIS.  what is your problem.  you make everything up.
Dylann Root is a terrorist and not a Muslim.  Think about that.

Didn't you say that you would stop Isis and terrorism within one month if you were elected? Guess that was also a lie.


Are you that ignorant??
@Amradib 
@Amradib 
Was there a country in the territory of American hydrocarbons? It's messy.
hahahahahahahaha OMG  You are President!?

Are you not considering our massive military base, as well as campuses of six American Universities, in Qatar? THINK before you tweet!
Who is behind this Fake  Trump account?  Or did someone take his phone away and put him on time out? This is not Trump putting these out.
But who will end the horror of you as president?
You are so ignorant on everything USA unsafe more now than ever!
