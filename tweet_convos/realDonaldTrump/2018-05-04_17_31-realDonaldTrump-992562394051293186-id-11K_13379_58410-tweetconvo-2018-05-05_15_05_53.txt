Michael Cohen's freeing up funds in 2016 could factor into a broad probe by Manhattan federal prosecutors and FBI into his actions for the Trump campaign  https://on.wsj.com/2KAaliG 
I'd compare it to the older brother who watches the younger brother grow bigger than he is. But China's 5k years older, and has a billion more people. I can accept this.
Did you discuss not having your crap made there?
MAGA is a lie!
Go away

SEND KANYE TO CHINA TO HANDLE THIS
ITS A NO BRAINER.....ITS A NO BRAINER.
Well you have the right man for the job if no brain  needed
You Mr. Anti-Constitution are no Patriot.
Trump is trying to abolish the First Amendment!
Vote Country over Party, we the true patriots will defend democratic rule of law!. Vote out the complicit GOP!
Americans are fools to think they have a democracy. That was destroyed decades ago, and they use the word like it has some sort of freedom. Your freedom is smashed altogether, if you dont bring back the constitution in its entirety. Dont be fooled by the word DEMOCRACY.

Huh? Which is it, US trade wins or Chinese exploitation?

You have a leak, someone told CNN it was a done deal in our favor.
Porn star vs Usa President
Yeah, they're just leaning on the US. Their entire economy, their $0.50 sandals and plush animals, their knock off iPad's - it's all reliant on us.

We could (and very likely will, based on how it's been going) fall off the face of the earth and they'd barely notice. You goon.
The results don’t exist. No plan. No agreement. Nothing
Thank you MR. PRESIDENT!





It’s really sad how true this is :-/: #fbr #fbrparty 

“I’m like, really smart!!” 
His attorney who doesn’t know anything about a major case but goes on national TV to discuss it
Headed to #MarALargo for more tax payer paid golf?  #GolferInCheif
Was this your reaction when Obama was playing golf almoner frequently than Trump? Also he owns the golf course so how is it tax payer funded?
Trump has played more golf in one year than Obama did in 8 years.

It costs money to fly him there, and it costs extra for security to travel and stay there. Are you really so dim as not to grasp this concept?
Oh your funny.  Trump has played 106 games of golf and only 51 of which are actually confirmed. During Obama's 8 years he played 306 days. IDK how y'all do math but 306 is bigger. By a great margin.
Perhaps you should normalize for the amount of time and see if trump is on pace to exceed Obama’s golfing.(he is) Or are you suggesting that he will stop playing golf....
He will exceed Obama at his current pace bit only after 4 years
So he is playing golf at twice the rate obama did.  Thanks for highlighting that for us. You aren’t very good at this are you.
I'll admit that is correct. However only 51 confirmed games thus far. That puts his eight years at approximately 400 games which is only 100 over Obama's.

Not only did those companies give out bonuses to their employees, employees also got tax cuts.  Just like my family did.  It wasn't crumbs.  We are all winning, why are you whining?  Those companies give to both sides.

Subpoenas.
Oh Gawd was this so recent?  Feels like weeks ago 

Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, gained access to as much as $774,000 through two financial transactions during the 2016 presidential campaign as he sought to fix problems for his boss, public records show.
‘Trump claims vaccines and autism are linked but his own experts vehemently disagree’
‘U.S. Farmers Are Already Suffering From Lost Chinese Orders for Corn, Soybeans and Pork’

‘Tariff dispute threatens to upend exports to a key market and U.S.’s share of global agricultural markets’ 
‘Iowa's new six-week 'heartbeat' abortion bill is a blatant attempt to reverse Roe v. Wade’

This is an obvious attempt by GOP to garner votes. Single issue voters are easily manipulated... to vote against their best interests.
‘Professor of Killology’ at NRA Convention blames violent video games for mass shootings’

Really? I blame violent NRA ads.
‘I’m done trying to understand Trump supporters. Why don’t they try to understand me?’
‘Donald Trump branded a 'disgrace' for claiming knife crime turned London hospital into a 'war zone'’

Donald, you are consistently on track for over-simplifying and grossly misleading people with sensationalistic garbage.
He should take a look at the schools which had shootings before opening his garbage mouth!

China is gonna own his ass. He can't bully them like everyone else. He's a pauper
China not taking our soybeans is excellent, now we won't have to subsidize the bunch of farmers to grow things to give away at a devalue drate. It is an excellent move. Now the farmers can grow what is needed and sell it on their own. The way it is supposed to be.
Yes, that is it, if u could buy them all

They've been having even more fun since I came to office. BTW, don't forget that my irresponsible tax cuts for billionaires are going to increase the federal deficit - meaning we have to BORROW more money from the Chinese. So I can't upset them too much. #HowDumbIsThisGuy

Farmers and other businesses will suffer because of your greed.
Why can't we do something about corporate greed here in the states? Think about how much the American people are losing..
All of these corporations post their record profits and it's never once brought up..How much do you share with your employees.
This is supposed to be one of the best nations. It's sickening how badly the government and corporations treat the people. We're enslaved to making other people wealthy. It's nothing but a big mob fukn the people out of their lives.
