You do know that in 2008 a Republican president crashed us into the worst economic crisis since the great depression, right?
john wake up your president increased the debt by trillions , and uped food stamps 58% for the lazy and capable
Both major party candidates suck, although Trump lies a lot more and doesn't have the temperament or intellect.
@EricTrumpif you think he lies more,the real piece of shit corrupt pandering con artist has you fooled.wake up Hillary will  end us
Also, checkout http://factcheck.org . It's independent. Trump lies about 90% of the time.  HRC about 50%.
john o don't believe that , pence isn't "sexy " enough to win in this modern day mess we call a country kassich would have beenbest
Honestly, you want HRC to win, because after 1 term she'll lose to a GOP candidate that can get 2 terms.
john hrc will destroy supreme Court , fill it with progressives
The recession sent it to $52,700, and now it has bounced back nicely as millions of jobs have been added. That's leadership.
doubling the debt, more than quadrupling the money supply & zero interest rates support this fake Obama bubble. Get real
That debt was going to be incurred no matter who was president because revenues dried up. But it's the Fed's bubble.
way too many executive actions, overreach by bloated federal bureaucracy creating stifling baseless regulation is reason
so why doesnt republican congress do something about it?
great question. Boehner, douche, McConnel sux No balls 2 fight politically correct libs and luv their cushy DC life
Besides, how would you even know what hard work is?
seriously? They are the hardest working family that I know of and have something called CHARACTER!
Now THAT's funny. At least you weren't one of the small businesses he refused to pay after they completed their job.
were you one of those alleged small businesses? I need to see some proof before I can believe those accusations.
This is misleading. In the fourth quarter of 2008, median household income was about $55,380.17, which means it has gone up.
hows it misleading he said 2007
it's misleading because the decline came about at the end of Bush's presidency.
and who is the bush admin backing?
I don't know and it's irrelevant.
It's hillary clinton and it shows most democrats and  most republicans  are corrupt
nobody forgot and it started in 2007 because of  bankers and bubbles.
trump's response to the minimum wage is to suppress it because he thinks his maids and gardeners get paid too much @brianefallon
Hey, @EricTrump: when #LoserDonald imports hundreds of workers to Mar-A-Lago...how does that help America?

#Loser
@realDonaldTrump so rich he didn't notice the recession?
but working another job struggling every week toare ends meet and keep a roof over my families head it's wrong
@realDonaldTrump We need! Less! Hyperbole!!!!!!!
all she wants is the first.women presidency, she will then drive for one world order
@realDonaldTrump your dad could have paid a higher wage. It just sounds like pandering now.
Qusay Trump is right, folks! I will Make America Great Again - just like it was in 2007. This I promise! @EricTrump
What a scary statistic! Americans are working harder and making less! We need competent leadership! 
So Eric is Qusay and Jr. is Uday?
We can't be PC about this, folks!. There is something going on there. I think they're the same person! @BobInBoulder
Dad had red hair (many years ago). mom had blond hair....I'm thinking Donald wasn't the only one cheating.
@realDonaldTrump That would be compared to the foreign workers you hired?
@realDonaldTrump and everything they need or are REQUIRED to buy costs 30% more.
And the National debt has doubled. What have we got for the additional  $10 TRILLION IN DEBT ??? Show us Obama / HRC !
@realDonaldTrump oh my god!  Did you get those numbers from the workers at your failing clothing line???!
Not quit there yet. Still working hard for that ever so elusive The American Dream I hear so much about. They say it's out there.
Mr. Trump, what about your income change between those dates?
- Enough of leader shit we are the humans of the 21. century.
@realDonaldTrump That has nothing to do with leadership and everything to do with  asshats like you and Daddy bribing Congress
like you comprehend this. Silver spoon boy. I'll live with less. Rather then live by what's stolen. Clown
@realDonaldTrump We need to make America Great Again and that starts with Donald Trump.
AND YOU PAY NO TAXES. SHOW THE TAX RETURNS COME ON TOUGH TRUMP
's dad didn't pay taxes on either of those years.
I don't understand that I work 56 hours a week and bring home 500 week I make 14K a year in hospice care
after taxes and obamacare. Not much to live on with 2 kids
@realDonaldTrump got any idea where we could find it??? Not someone who has been bankrupt 4 times and won't disclose his taxes
Competent leadership is exactly why @realDonaldTrump will NEVER be elected! #NeverTrump
Do you have tiny hands like your Dad?
Donnie the Clown little boy. Of course he is tiny just like Papa Clown.
@realDonaldTrump ok...guess we vote hillary
@realDonaldTrump True! Poor them yet they pay taxes on that little they get! What an unfair world to live in!!!
actually with growing population, stagnate wages, those numbers dont say much
@realDonaldTrump lol what because we are less than $1000 away from where we were at the peak of a bubble before the recession?
https://youtu.be/4AWn22-JebQ 
Competent leadership and the @realDonaldTrump Trump name: an oxymoron!
what's worse is evil and smart she's already played stupid!
Waiting on the head spin, seen it shake already!,lol
green pea soup! Lol
@realDonaldTrump #LIARS https://www.census.gov/prod/2009pubs/acsbr08-2.pdf …
MEDIAN INCOME WAS 52.673$
@realDonaldTrump Gov has destroyed this country Give money away by the billions Increase taxes on Comp& Americans by the billions
-I gave facts on FB last night, our cks have gone down from $137 000 (n 1935) to $55,000 (n 2013)- eye opener
@realDonaldTrump U don't have to be taken down w/ your father. Expose his sh@t. He has rape charges; his lies r scary! Grow up!!
THIS IS 2016 STUPID!!!
@GarisonCarrell many middle taxpayers can not afford modest healthcare,just ask me,WHY DOES MY MAR? DISABLED LIFEmatter?
ty 4 sharing I live in Pgh Pa, 4127822151/ I need help...ASAP,can assist with the disaster of none care bhocare
Look at the debt? Obama's going to spend over 10 TRILLION DOLLARS in 8 years. What did we get for it? Nothing!  He's a moron.
Enuff said
@realDonaldTrump Obama deceived America with his hope and change but the kind of the change he did was all negative worst pres
All due to law makers I agree, all Republican controlled cash houses, Senate and Congress blocked job bills, duh
and that's middle class.  Most people I know make under 20 and even under 15 thousand a YR
.@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump that's cherry picking the years. 2007 was the height of the bubble:
Because your dad doesn't pay them when they finish the job? Because he files for bankruptcy 4 times?
@realDonaldTrump that's says 2015... how about u tell me what 2016 is and then tell me how well my 2017 will be?...
Ahemm. DT-1.0 said he's working harder and has no sympathy for those who aren't doing better.
@realDonaldTrump Since when have any of you cared about struggling Americans?
where is this med income,  like 2 go there, lol.  PA's income not close, lost job and the best is $12 hr, can't pay a mort. on it
@realDonaldTrump   What could you possibly understand about real life?
@realDonaldTrump and not increasing the minimum wage is going to do that...how exactly?
@realDonaldTrump Some people have to work two three jobs to make ends meet, deplorable.
good job Obama let's elect Killary and see if we stay the same of even bring the statistic down even lower a race to the bottom.
And you think daddy donnie is competent - have you talked to him lately ??????
LOL. The words "competent" and Trump do NOT go together.
Still looking!
We sure do! Glad to see you agree our country's current leader is shit
what we need is someone who will not rob us blind and then say it's good business! WAKE UP!!
Go Trump!
How can I erase your comments from Twitter?
When is that arriving then?
So give some of your millions away.
Chris, why don't u become a Successful Entrepreneur? You have what it takes - everybody does 
I didn't have daddy - and granddaddy - to start me off with $2 billion.
....I want EVERYONE to get ahead, to be Wealthy and Prosperous AND Debt, Credit free.....
Keep fighting, every day, take nothing for granted, push for every vote, our country is depending on your family. #TrumpPence2016

@realDonaldTrump and watch the rich rise.....
not to mention cost of living increases and inflation. This number going down is very bad! Upward should be the only trend.
Educate yourself. Corporate America is to blame. Those like Trump who need more. So they can brag.
you sound very well educated on the internal view of your colon.
Troy your father wiped the essential part of you onto the curtain. I'm sorry. Your not alone....GOP.
When you're at the rally anyway, why don't you say a few words!
Oh god are there really going to be more Trumps in politics and the media now? We should all kill ourselves.
@realDonaldTrump wasn't your dad the one saying wages are too high and we shouldn't raise the minimum wage ???
@realDonaldTrump  Competent? Donald? Are you serious? Naw think I'll pass on the Trump Train.....
@realDonaldTrump Are you including the salaries of the sub-contractors that your father stiffed? #CrookedDonald #helies
@realDonaldTrump someone other than #daddy #dumptrump
after 8 years, how about inflation and cost of living??it's a paucut!!
Competent is a word that should never be used in the same sentence as "Trump". Where are Daddy's taxes?
@MelBchREALTOR And the cost of living increases are killing American families
How did your family fare as they dodged paying taxes and pillaged charitable contributions? #BasketofDeplorables #NeverTrump
Because greedy people like your family sent jobs out of the country. #MadeInAmericaMatters  #NeverTrump
And how much of a raise did your daddy give to his contractors and employees within that time frame, Trumpstick
@realDonaldTrump hahaha, show the data from the years in between. #deceptivedata
> @erictrump Who Certified Mental Health of @realdonaldtrump? @jpnadda @getup @ungeneva
@realDonaldTrump In the Bay Area people work 2 or more jobs which means less time for family and little time to be healthy.
@realDonaldTrump umm. Nice cherry picking. In 2008 before Obama took office it was under $54,800 and dropping. #HonestDon #
@realDonaldTrump and those under the too 10% of ur Corp. get small raises, less benefits and no paid maternity too
@jkaccinni Pathetic.
What was it 08/09 after the Republican led crash?
@realDonaldTrump Shame that 'Competent leadership' excludes your sad Dad, Dirty Donald
@realDonaldTrump wow the apple doesn't fall far from the stupid tree... A whole family of liars
if only the Fed could get inflation going...
@realDonaldTrump so why don't you pay your staff?
@realDonaldTrump 
Trump is a Racist Birther
@realDonaldTrump Its time to stop the.@HilaryClinton's of Gov Bribes Pay Offs Fund wars & Coups Give away R military 4 free
@realDonaldTrump ummmm no we're not.
Not just that Obama, the 1st prez in 30 yrs is giving little to no cola increases for ssdi and social security
@realDonaldTrump I work 48 hrs. a week and still don't make that much per year. I'll be so glad once your dad takes office.
@realDonaldTrump So then you agree we don't need your father. He has proved over and over he is incompetent.
@realDonaldTrump     That would be 2008 vs. 2016. Good job eric. Your brother, sister and you falling apart.
@realDonaldTrump Every politician says SS is the largest part of Gov spending We fund wars by the trillions Give away billions
@realDonaldTrump your Awesome father only one with balls size of an elephant that can fix that. I love T!
@realDonaldTrump http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/12/donald-trumps-business-failures-election-2016-486091.html …
@realDonaldTrump 
What a scary statistic! My old man has filed for more bankruptcies than he has applied for jobs! Sad!
Census Bureau said that median household income surged 5.2 % last year to $56,500,the highest since 2007.Biggest jump since1968.
US sees stronger median household income, less poverty http://cnb.cx/2cURWNd 
@realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @cnnbrk  like one who doesn't think there's a need for minimum wage increase? Keep them down, right?
Disheartening.
Time for a change... We need a raise in order for our country to prosper
Every basic cost has gone up - rent, food, insurance, auto/medical,water insurance,taxes- hurts Elderly too.
Many of these are public school teachers who make less and less each year despite having 1 of the most impt. jobs
I agree. DonTheCon is a fraud and a con. You know it. He is a race baiting xenophobic bigot. He is an UnAmerican crook. No2DT
Maybe it the asshole business owners like your dad and yourself who cut hours and don't pay more, fire&hire, isn't how you save?
Hey Putz, they're making less because your father won't pay them what they earned. You can't run from the past.
why does some people live in the past??????????????
@realDonaldTrump you're an idiot if you think that time frame has anything to do with Obama.
your old man is about as competent a politician as you are his spokesman. How bout your daddy post some stats.
That statistic is not only scary, but a disgrace. You would expect a stat like that from a third world country. ..Not the USA!!
This is misleading.  The 2007 number was before the Bush depression.  US has led G7 in recovery.  Let's get real here!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe if Trump Co actually PAID people for work done, people would make more cash. Jerks
@realDonaldTrump and your economic plan will make it worse
Many of us who lost everything R NOW 2 old 2 recoup! Thx 2 BO we won't get a 2nd chance! POS BO took all.
I wish groceries cost what they cost in 2007
Static analysis has been a staple of the GOP for many years. #Trumplies. It is on the upswing BC of GWB's wars. #Bushlies
@realDonaldTrump Except you two! Lucky you !!
UNTRUE!
@realDonaldTrump it will be  worst if u and your family  goes to  the  white house so we will do everything in our pwr.2stop  it
Yeah, that will solve it.
@SassyNJcowgirl Believe me I know it and it is extremely stressful and will cause more illness
@realDonaldTrump what the hell do you know about work? Sit down somewhere or go to jail where your daddy should be.
@realDonaldTrump LIE! Medium income went up! How do you make up this crap? Buffoon.
@realDonaldTrump Have all the Trumps forgotten what happened in 2009?
We're not going to get it from Daddy.
u'r scary...and a liar just like your daddy...LIARS!

@realDonaldTrump
Michael Snyder Has more information
@realDonaldTrump your dad hire illegals n don't pay them. Con small business contract m file 11 bankruptcy n don't pay taxes
@realDonaldTrump we always need competent leadership.  Unfortunately that isn't your father, not by a long shot.
@MrEdTrain    I thought we were lazy?
, maybe because you and the other 1 percent have 97% of the wealth? AND you pay your workers poorly. #CognitiveDissonance
@realDonaldTrump forces these numbers down when he doesn't pay vendors what he owes, just declares bankruptcy
@realDonaldTrump -Now this is what I call DEPLORABLE!
@realDonaldTrump ERIC, 2007 WAS B4 BUSH TANKED OUR ECONOMY, CRASHED OUR MARKETS, STOLE OUR FINANCES, AND OUR HOMES! JUST SAY NO!
@realDonaldTrump so true!
And they are probably also paying more in taxes than your daddy!   Tell him to release his TAX RETURNS!
@realDonaldTrump Eric. For your dad. But,that stat will not register with independents. Hitlery will
@realDonaldTrump Release those taxes! Stop hiding the tax facts from supporters. Global business, charities,taxes paid and income
@realDonaldTrump how many companies have you short changed thru the years! A vote for trump is a vote for the devil!
Love all the hateful comments from the left on here. Must mean it's true and you hit a nerve.  Also worst GDP ever
@gs777gs777 you would think "conservatives" would be on the stats . Hint: not conservative.
They're doing much better since Obama took over. #Hidingsomethingbiginthetaxesbelievemebigtime!

@realDonaldTrump Muchacho, go change your diaper and leave politics to the grown ups. You tweet as many lies as what daddy says
Like to know where they get their numbers. I'm making substantially more today, same job than I was in 2007.
@realDonaldTrump This is hard , I can't keep up with the stupid, that the Trump people and followers put out
@realDonaldTrump your sister, Ivanka, doesn't seem to know what a blind trust is. What a depressing realization.
@realDonaldTrump yep..yoi indeed make le ss that's a great game coming from holland and germany.1 earth and she is fooling back.
And people want more of this??? Let's Make America Great Again! Vote @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump 2007 was a Republican administration in case you were too young to remember.
@cking64050 yes we are Eric
Your father is a lot of thing, but competent doesn't immediately come to mind.  Go wash your hair too much oil kid.
@realDonaldTrump Your dad's not it. Stiffs the little guy.
@realDonaldTrump exactly...... why we DONT need your father
meanwhile, any foreign owned businesses, get a tax pass for 3 years, can change hands, avoid taxes for years. Stacked against us.
@realDonaldTrump Your father said we are overpaid. Is this part of that statement?
Fox business, eh? @jrbixby
@realDonaldTrump personally I earn $11,000 less now, lost my job when economy tanked.  Ouch.
@realDonaldTrump you're right!  And it's not your crooked dopey father!
@tweetybird2009 Thanks Obama
