- Hearts and Prayers to Everyone Touched by this Catastrophe. Make America Safe/Proud Again.
As if you pray. Prayer is for the religious. After @HillaryClinton beats you, you should go into comedy.
where in the Bible does it say it's abomination to pray for the wicked.
DO YOU PRAY TO YOURSELF  RELEASE THE TAX RETURNS
- To shoot somebody in America you have to wear a uniform - at home or abroad otherwise it is crime.

No "thoughts & prayers" to the other 5 PEOPLE who were shot? So you d/n care!?! Your true colors are showing!
@abc7newsbayarea Why do I get a picture of animal sacrifices being part of your prayer ritual?
@abc7newsbayarea tax returns? Your 4000 lawsuits, unpaid vendors, disgruntled workers will become known
@abc7newsbayarea Ha! Bet you've never prayed in your life.
I hate to hear any officer down. I live in a neighborhood with many as neighbors, Sandy from Alabama
@abc7newsbayarea Trump reported the bomb before authorities had facts. Police might want 2 question him
@abc7newsbayarea DJT.
@abc7newsbayarea yes he will.
But your thoughts don't go out to the hundreds shot in the back, most of them unarmed. Good, Don. Good.
Okay, so your prayers go out to the police officers, but not the other innocent people that got shot in Philadelphia?
I call bullshit on you @realDonaldTrump @PhillyPolice Don't think this guy gives a damn about you for a second.  @Penn
You don't even know how to pray. You have no soul - you sold it long ago.
You don't have thoughts @realDonaldTrump impossible! andWe know you don't pray!!@CaribbeanCaptn @PhillyPolice @Penn @abc7newsbayarea
nobody wants to be in your thoughts because your brain is wired on racism, misogyny, and incest.
God bless you Mr Trump. Always the compassionate gentleman.
@abc7newsbayarea a leader who cares about us Trumps one who just wants power and money, and cares less.
@abc7newsbayarea  Please debate Hillary and call her out if it's a body double?! Her campaign is FAKE!!

@abc7newsbayarea result of HRC  promoting racial division and Bertherism. Blood on her hands
Obama's real legacy to HRC. Progressing back to segregation/hate & division. They don't condemn it.
How about the woman civilian who was killed. All victims are equal!
@LindaSuhler @PhillyPolice @Penn @abc7newsbayarea 
Thank you, Colin Kaepernick & NFL cohorts. Your protest really inspires.
You have zero sincerity.... You have been inciting violence @PhillyPolice @Penn @abc7newsbayarea
@abc7newsbayarea This is so horrible. Prayers for their families. This needs to stop.
@abc7newsbayarea where are your thoughts and prayers for the non police victims?
@abc7newsbayarea Your the man Trump get that win!
@abc7newsbayarea 
Ironic since you don't pray & probably don't believe on God.
@abc7newsbayarea  don't see Hillary ever posting about anything like this.
God bless and protect our police officers!!!
Another City run by Democrat's just like Camden NJ across the Delaware River.

@abc7newsbayarea 5 blocks from my kid's house it could have been her. SMH

Trump hasn't had a moment of self-examination in years. Lives absorbed life unable to self critique
YEA SURE, THEY DO, U LYIN RACIST PANDERER AND HYPOCRITE #nevertrump SHOW INCOME TAXES
@abc7newsbayarea We, the U.S. people need #Trump to get rid of @HillaryClinton #AntiPolice people!
