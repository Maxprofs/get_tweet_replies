This guy @realDonaldTrump is out of his mind. "Thanks Donald!"? Seriously? Not "Thanks - Donald" or "My thanks" - HE'S THANKING HIMSELF
Oh my god, he's Rickey Henderson in disguise.
minus the talent, yes
My theory is a secondary account tweet was sent on his primary.
My theory is, HE'S NUCKING FUTS!
good luck America
I refuse to picture Trump as an unclothed emperor!
maybe seek help before you take the oath
I think he meant "thanks Obama."
why would he? That guy has done way more wrong than good. Fact. Get your head out of your ass.
Opinions aren't facts. Fact.
Fine. Here's your fact - Rising consumer confidence under Obama since '08. The increase is good, FYI.
HOW DARE YOU INTERJECT FACTS INTO THIS!
here's more facts for all trumplets to cry about. Calling a troll attack! 
They won't care. Truth doesn't matter to them
That's called the Obama economy.
@vsansome @realDonaldTrump He's nuts!!! Literally nuts!!
Not sure Republican Party exists anymore for even mildly stable. Taken over by loons
First, Trump must be kept in check. He's absolutely a threat to the US and the World.
in general I'm not a radical alarmist BUT I truly believe many many people fail 2 see the imminent danger of DT
.@realDonaldTrump You should thank Obama, too:
Consumer Confidence Index, January 2009: 37.7
Consumer Confidence Index, October 2016: 100.8
Dude is talking to himself in the third person.
Yep, either that or inattentive staffer posted from the wrong account. Who knows what goes on in the Tower..
Do not discount his level of idiocy. This is 100% Trump.
He definitely posted it per @RealRealDonaldT
biggest popular vote loss in history is not bigly it's barely
This is getting weird. You're weird.
So weird.
@realDonaldTrump The weirdest.
Super fucking weird.
Please don't be disrespectful toward alien cockroaches.
perhaps the President of the PAST 8 YEARS had something to do with it? Thanks @POTUS @BarackObama!
rising consumer confidence since 2008 (per @UMich)
Don't deflect. FACT: the CCI has risen dramatically since 2008 financial crisis.
u attribute this rise to  Trump blindly..but Obama gets no credit...you are sad
are you trying to make a thanks, Obama type thing happen here?
Trying to take credit for Obama's economy is a new low even for this narcissistic shitbird.
You realize he will take credit for earth's creation if we let him.
Sun came up today... Cha-Ching!
Just look at all the air you get to breathe because of me! This is yuuge. It's Tremendous!
There are a lot of grievances to have with Trump, but his questionable BILLIONAIRE status isn't one.
Yeah, it is. His ability to make money while making other (Americans) poor is concerning.
Trump is terrible at being a billionaire.
He'd be much richer if he'd only collected interest on inheritance.
He's an objectively crappy businessman.
Donald loves Donald
Nobody loves Donald more than Donald. In fact, Kanye may love Kanye less than Donald loves Donald.
that says a lot too, because Kanye loves himself bigly
“Thanks Donald!” Narcissist in Chief is now thanking himself for things he had nothing to do with. @realDonaldTrump
The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!
DJT absolutely unfit to govern. Hoping FBI investigation finds collusion with Putin and he's charged w/treason
@jenscorpio83 @Green_Footballs Maybe these are seeds he's planting incase he is tried for treason. Can claim mental illness.
.@realDonaldTrump Unemployment rates have dropped to 4.6% - a level not seen since August 2007. Thanks Shannon!
i love your tweets so much, so smart and funny 
Thanks Shannon!
I think the @realDonaldTrump just likes the sound of his own name - even if he's the one saying it
.@realDonaldTrump
The internet flawlessly responds to Trump's self-appreciation by showing THEIR appreciation (or lack of) with #ThanksDonald:
did you just thank yourself? Are you serious? We have a loon on the loose... I mean in the White House. Very humble indeed.
lol Pat! Come on now! Trump is no conservative. You & I know that. Although he is very entertaining 
babe, we're all losers in this. Don't you believe we deserve better? I don't want Hillary for prez but I want her cooperation 
awwww are you triggered? Do you need a safe space? A support group perhaps?Don't worry, you got your president. Looney he may be
did you just thank yourself for something you had nothing to do with? In the 3rd person? Asking for a friend.
I fixed it for you.

who the hell would want to spend 30+ years fingerpainting in poverty praying a volatile market would redeem itself
who the hell would answer a question like that
If he didn't start with Daddy's money, he'd be nothing. #Fact
Your idea of a "fact" is pretty worrisome there. No wonder you're so confused.
Sometimes I think we're all in a special anniversary edition of Twilight Zone.
are you sure it isn't?
Nope.
.@realDonaldTrump Sorry, sweetie, I was asleep. I'm glad you're all puffed up but you can thank yourself after you've Presidented a little.
.@realDonaldTrump And let's treat this inherited good fortune with caution and respect this time, Donald John.
I literally picture you burping him on your lap while giving him advice
This thread is relevant once again. Taking credit for something that you did not contribute to.
You have a Messiah complex and you're a loon for believing you helped holiday spending totals. 
to himself (again): "You and only you are responsible for anything positive in the economy."
this passage is super relevant.
One anecdote from a story on why Obama is not given credit for the huge drop in unemployment in an Indiana city: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/its-not-the-economy-stupid/511634/ … 
You misspelled "Obama."
#ThanksObama
 thank you (or do I thank myself for something I didn't do?)
Uh, I don't know what you're thanking me for but you're welcome. #ImSoConfused
when in doubt just talk in third person and congratulate yourself for something you didn't do
In that case, good job inventing ramen, Paul. And the chicken, I imvented the chicken.
Though Paul clearly didn't invent spelling. Stupid Paul.
Trump can't spell #beliketrump #rediculous #unpresidented
& @realDonaldTrump stupid 10% market tweet relates to this as well. His voters hide $$ in mattresses and believe his BS.
no doubt the #aca was a rough bit. I know people have struggled w/ costs & others benefited. Still, Trump's lies aren't justified.
My experience with ACA is great. I have pre-existing cond. Couldn't have health ins. at all. A lot of ppl love it
indeed, of the ppl who I know that was their prime reason for liking the ACA. Changed one woman's life completely.
Are you honestly thanking yourself? Do you know how insane you sound?
so you've never rewarded yourself for a job well done? Like celebrated?
But DJT hasn't done anything yet...he's taking credit for someone else's.
idiot.  #snowflake
#stupid minion
Wait, I am confused, who is talking to whom now?  And isn't Obama still POTUS?
@CarlaMoulton3 @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama!
.@realDonaldTrump tying yourself directly to movements in specific economic indicators is a good and smart thing that won't backfire ever
The Trump train only goes up, up, up! ... Or maybe sideways, sideways, sideways? The way a train goes!

Seems @realDonaldTrump has been catching up on vintage @alfranken. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/813945096269860866 …
How do you constantly pat yourself on the back with those tiny hands?
Did you just thank yourself?
The Consumer Confidence Index has risen dramatically over the LAST 8 YEARS. It's not an overnight phenomenon. (via @UMich)
Additionally it is only the hope and pray part that has moved up. BTW not umich numbers that were released.
CCI is similar to @OECD CCI w/upward trend since 2008.

(red=USA, black=WORLD) https://data.oecd.org/leadind/consumer-confidence-index-cci.htm …
All are similar. Not questioning validity. Only remarking trump was referencing Conference Board CCI
"Thanks Donald."
Uh, is talking to yourself an impeachable offense?
he's the only one that will hold a real conversation with himself! 
Did you seriously just thank yourself in a tweet from your own Twitter account?
Honestly, good on you, buddy! Gotta have that self confidence!
Thanks Mark!
I think that Jesus guy might deserve some of the credit for shopping spiking in December, though. Thanks Jesus!
Sorry, that wasn't Jesus, you are thinking of Retailers and Marketers.
Understood, but the point is, it ISN'T because he was elected. Steady trend up since 2009. @MarkPygas @realDonaldTrump
But as usual he's taking credit for something he had nothing to do with. @ramirezricky17 @MarkPygas @realDonaldTrump
Obama cannot be trusted, @realDonaldTrump. Today, he expelled 35 Russian operatives. But refuses to release hacking facts. Ridiculous!
maybe he wants to trade for Trump's Tax returns that have Russia secretly hidden ALL over them...
Wow, are you really this stupid or are you just playing with us? @tammietoren1
Says the pot to the kettle.  Jesus Christ.
Uh huh. Now.... go away. You pathetic, sore losers bore me. @tammietoren1
You ignorant, no talent,  non-fact spewing, hate mongers bore me.  Go cut off some more jean shorts...
Oh pumpkin, I detect some jealousy! Why not get in some exercise. Maybe you can sport some short shorts, too @tammietoren1
....or, are you just a couch potato who loves to pig out on cakes/cookies while sitting on your a$$ & throw insults at people? @tammietoren1
You lost the popular vote by almost 3 million and enter the WH with the lowest approval rating in history. Sad!
not counting California, he won the popular vote, won more States, & electors. CA had illegals and dead votes
CA counts, and illegal votes are false narrative. But if we don't count TX, HRC won EC! 
Your the one with the false narrative. http://www.fairus.org/issue/noncitizens-voting-violations-and-u-s-elections …
see, it's ignorant  psychos like you that make this so hard
Second time I've read that article. Here is a counter argument http://www.fairus.org/issue/noncitizens-voting-violations-and-u-s-elections …
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-25/politifact-apparently-even-facts-are-subjective-and-based-party-affiliation …
Your article cites Breitbart and The Federalist. Shaky ground much?
Not nearly as shaky as the scientific breakdown politifact as a dishonest disreputable embarrassment of a source.
.@realDonaldTrump just thanked HIMSELF for something he didn't even do. He is a joke, w/ lowest approval rating of any PEOTUS in history.
He's a self egotistical bully
He would rather masturbate on Twitter than hold a press conference. The man is an infant.

Come on, dude. Don't thank urself, especially 4 something u had nthing 2 do with. Only really, really weird people do that.


I know you are but what am I?
Tell me one thing that PERSONALLY you are disappointed about Barack.
Heard of the migrants in Europe, who bombed them? We went from just Iraq to 7 countries.
That is a result of the war Bush started. I'll give you that Libya was a horrible mistake. But these were problems handed to him.
Nope this is for an oil pipeline started with HRC as Secretary of State
What's that supposed to prove? Sovereign countries run their own economy?
Weapons Pop-Up Shop, Oil Infrastructure, Using "Moderate Rebels"=ISIS Proxy War.
.@realDonaldTrump thanking yourself in the third person for something you AT BEST are partially responsible for is frighteningly arrogant.
SORRY HE IS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE for anything THANKS OBAMA! BEST PRESIDENT EVER STILL VERY LOVED AND RESPECTED
: "So right now everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit." #NeedForApproval
Is this already mental disorder?
Is what a mental disorder?
This clapping with somebody else hands...
we have put our confidence in your leadership. Make it happen! #maga
No, "we" haven't.
Why are you are thanking yourself in tweets? Oh yeah. Because nobody else will.
shut up
.@realDonaldTrump you’re an intolerable jizz stain on the history of the world. I hope you get a severe case of horribly weepy hemorrhoids
.@San_Frexit are you reporting me to the FBI for wishing horrible hemorrhoids on Donald Trump? I really fucking hope so.
dude, broke ass, don't give this guy the time of day. He's a crazed racist (or super dedicated troll at best).
yes?
ok so "super dedicated troll" was the correct assumption
'wannabe' Sometimes I dream
That he is me
I dream I move, I dream I groove
Like @BarackObama 
If I could Be Like Obama
A single teardrop rolls down his cheek as little Donnie lowers his eyes and points to Raggedy Andy's heart..
And talking in third person is in no way a narcissistic trait.
I guess if you keep looking and you see me then that is as many times. Nice wink face after your name. 
You come here to see what trump says but read alllll the replies, don't lie to yourself.
and yet...
the media won't put it out the because it's NOT true
OF COURSE it's true. Yours 2 prove it's not.
it's already been shown/proven by the facts. Consumer index rose under Obama:
97 million out of work?  Is that what you said? Wow, so off!!!
I see a U3 and U6, considering underemployed is almost 10%, possibly 16 million people.  Is that it?
yeah, a billionaire who defeated all candidates from both parties to win the presidency is 'stupid' #MAGA
I'm glad you agree
He said "thanks Donald"

why are you taking credit for this?  You haven't been inaugurated yet. You did not cause this.  @BarackObama did.
what about Virginia .We are apart of the DMV
those are not your policies that caused this result..Get a life. And show us your fabulous grades while you're at it.
over a billion people world wide are shaking their heads wondering how such a complete incompetent loser could become POTUS
can u tell us everything u know about computers? Remember u r limited to 140. Hint..Long skinny black thing is the plug.
WE R SO SCREEEWED @KeithOlbermann
@SpeakerRyan Common Donnie..Seriously..U want to take credit for Obama's success over the past 8 years. How low will you go
No, the proper person to thank is President Obama.
You mean Obama? He's still President.
AGREE! =======>>> OUR PRESIDENT STILL @POTUS 
Time to read up or have Ivanka at least  do so ..
Trump & many of the rest of us could do to read a little bit more about the important issues.
But do we ever know the full ripple of choices even in our own life till they fully play out? nope
He may very well do both...Evil people tend to go wild with abuses when they get into power.
taken credit for a job you haven't  started . welcome Trump world
No, thanks to President Obama, It is because of all the hard work of President Obama's team is paying off.
How small is your penis? Compulsion to take credit for everything positive seems rooted in an inferiority complex.
Those figures have got absolutely nothing to do with you and the WHOLE WORLD can see that!
It took the DEMS a full 8 years to clean up the MESS left by your party in 2008.
don't refer to yourself in 3rd person, it makes you seem douchier than you already are
@NewportLost We love you Trump!
Yes Liberals it looks like a great New Year. Trumps the Man. Eat your hearts out. LOL
Bizarre is right. Delusional is also correct. QUIT LYING @realDonaldTrump http://www.politicususa.com/2016/12/28/donald-trump-takes-credit-consumer-confidence-index.html … #CrookedDonald #LOCKHIMUP
You had nothing to do with this, just like you had nothing to do with those 5000 Sprint jobs!
Why can't u realize that this stuff has nothing 2 do w u & it's all bc of Obama!!! & yes I said it....OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA
#FuckTrump #Trump #NotMyPresident #NeverMyPresident #TheResistance #NeverTrump #TrumpLeaks "Repealing Obamacare"
nope. Thanks Barack. We will never ever thank you. For anything. Why? Because there’s nothing to thank you for except maybe showing us how to fight fascism in a modern world.
Thanks, Donald????? 
lol..thanks Obama!! I miss him sooo much! 
it is not your economy you damned Tangerine Shitgibbon
Love ., "Tangerine shitgibbon" 
thank you I swiped it somewhere or other
Glad you did! 
You had nothing to do with the Consumer Confidence Index.
Yes, and we thank President Obama for pulling us out of the great recession.
You FRICKIN troll really don't realize that the president is #PBO not http://you.You  are a #SerialRapist #ChildMolester #safetypin
The sun came up. Thanks @realDonaldTrump

It’s now talking to itself like Gollum.
"Thanks Donald" ?? Your multiple personalities are showing
Congratulations @BarackObama our only @POTUS Amazing economy, favorability rating! Sad nothing improves 4 @realDonaldTrump Seek help Twitler
You have nothing to do with this. Taking credit for the work of others is a dick move.
Right! You can thank Obama for that you incredible narcissist and self-promoter. Democrats will have to clean up your mess
#ThanksObama

@KazmierskiR >Obama Hillary are losers the cast lost face to Trump they make fake news blame PUTIN to use fake excuses 2020
narcissistic wind bag. Delete your account. NEVER FORGET 2,864,974 MORE people wanted @HillaryClinton to be #POTUS
Ha ha ha. I must burst. We got to the point when the #narcissist-in-chief thanks himself!!!  Mirror mirror on the wall ...
What did you do EXACTLY!? YOU TAKING CREDIT FOR THINGS YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER SHOWS YOUR MENTAL INSTABILITY.
Thanks Obama!
WHAAAT?YOU tweeted a thank you to yourself? Since "hacking is so difficult" it must be you making yourself look insane
Thanks Donald?  You didn't do this - you mean Thanks Obama.
new years to do list. Provide your tax returns,college transcript,health care plan, birth certificate,and exit strategy.
DJT you are my hero & example.,your ability to kiss ass & pick pocket at the same time must of taken decades to perfect.
Self-congratulation without one ounce of irony.
look Mr. President, @PrivateIdahoan pats himself on the back too.
Seriously you need psychiatric help, you are seriously delusional & psychotic in your thinking.
BS - you are a big phony.  You went bankrupt all those times - not a good business person.
thanks President Obama!
Once they learn what voting for you produces, (SS, Medicare, health care gutting) the surge will be a plummet.
US Consumer Confidence has been climbing steadily for almost 8 years. You sir had nothing to do with it. THANK YOU OBAMA
So now you're taking credit for what O'bama's done? You're pathetic!
You haven't taken office yet, idiot-elect. That would be: Thank you President @BarackObama  #selfflatuelentcongrats
@protesting2016 December? You were not President in December so don't think any thanks goes to you, believe me.
a big thank you to President Obama
you thank your self?! What a loser!
#thanksObama for all you've done for 8 years. I will miss you and your wonderful family, bigleague.
You need help.  These delusions are a precursor to a much more dangerous mental illness.  They have meds for guys like you.
I'm not president yet and this is to Obama's credit? Oh. I'm sorry & excuse me. #shortfingeredvulgarian
It wasn't because of you, you fool!  Don't take credit for things you did not do.
thanking yourself? Seriously!
You mean "Thanks, Pres. Obama," don't you? And talking to yourself in 3rd person is a sign of mental illness! Get help!
Sorry to say that is a reflection on President Obama and his office...stop patting yourself on the back nothing.
I think you mispelled Obama... "Thanks Obama!"
LMAO. Has way more to Do w #TheBlackGentlemanRunningCountry then #ClownElect
Taking credit for other's work. How sad, very sad little man.
I love you
you give urself way 2 much credit where credit is not due.  Please learn to control your narcissism. Its vry unbecoming !
Macy's just announced they are closing 68 stores and cutting 10,000 jobs. Thanks Donald!
@brendenmasden This dawg thanked himself.
Really? Sorry,but no matter how hard you try to impress him,your Daddy still wont love and respect you like you need him to

how can you take credit, your not even in office...loser.
What else could he thank himself for?
THANK YOU OBAMA!
I think you meant, "Thanks President Obama!" BTW, have you seen his approval rating is 58% and your is 37%? Very sad!
So when are you going to take credit for stock fall on 12-29. You screwed it up by lying about Sprint!
YOU DIDN'T DO IT!
Umm, you do realize Obama is still president, right? 
@SovreigntyFox Thanks Donald 
I think you mean, "Thanks, Obama!" @POTUS @BarackObama
Are you thanking yourself now, sir? Maybe about time to see a specialist (doctor).
did you just thank yourself?

Also, you aren't president. You have no power. This goes under Obama's legacy.
you've done NOTHING
bruh, you just thanked yourself in the third person for essentially existing during an economic trend.
Can't wait so excited to have a REAL man at the helm! Tweet on Trump F'em we love you!
Thank eight years of intelligent economic policies by Pres. Obama for such a strong US economy!
You're not even in office yet, so calm down. YOUR economy starts next month. This is still President Obama's economy.
Thank you , president Obama.
You're not even President yet. You had nothing to do with these rising numbers.
