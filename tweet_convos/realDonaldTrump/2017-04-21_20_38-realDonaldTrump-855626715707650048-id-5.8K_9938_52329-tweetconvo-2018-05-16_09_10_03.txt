You are a Joke.
After 5 SB victories since 2002, it was my honor to give Bob Kraft, Coach Belichick, and the players their first to… htt...

Glass of water please
Despite media & liberals everywhere, Pres. Trump just keeps on working for Americans & keeping promises.  GO DJT
You're kind of like Rapunzel, except instead of letting your hair down, you let us all down.
Of victory I snort furious lines, sheer fire shot to a heart dense.
Thanks 
ha! ha! What's another cheater in the WH #amiright
That s all you are is a tour guide at the Whitehouse in everyone s opinion.  Isn t that the job of hired help.
More of the team showed up for Obama! So sad!
Well it seems fitting that a CHEATING team should visit a CHEATING so-called "president".
1st time Kraft's been there? You sure? Even Tonya Brady? You Sure? What about religious leaders? 1st time.?? 1st time you let KKK in..Wow.
YES! Because you can't stop WINNING! Bigly!
Glad the real team saw what a racist you are and did not show up
How wonderful
-So kewl!
Wassup gay trump
Whats up donald j trump
How many refused to be there?  Lol!!!
Mr PrE$ T & the Greatriot$ !!! LoL ;) !
Get a job.

That's not the only thing you gave them 
You're a champion too Mr. President and more so! God Bless you.
Continue praying to God.
O sweety you are,so far off the mark
Odd... looks like a lot of the team skipped your HGTV reality show.
Funny players didn't show. Hahahaha
Mad Dog Donald strikes again. Try spending time fashioning a fix for our decent health care system.
Mr. President, hanging out with the famous and celebs are fine, but we the FORGOTTEN feel VERY FORGOTTEN now!!!
Oh wow, one cheater praises another. What does Melania think about that? #shutthefuckupdonny #thedudewasright
Football doesn't matter.
Really appreciate the words of sentiment, encouragement and inspiration from this.
Not as many players came to to meet with Trump. President Obama had a great turn out.
How embarrassing for the Patriots!
Both of you prove that cheaters do prosper
Good example for your children
You mean the only team members that showed up.
nobody cares- its a dumb game- lets see them and you put your money where your mouth is. PEOPLE FIRST
Finally the WH can be a home to the BRAVE vs the sad screwball that ruined our country the past 8 years.
ha ha so many of the players didn't show up because they despise you
They've been 4 other times... @mixedchixx ...it damn sure ain't their first tour
But facts don't matter @deem324 remember?
No victory. You stole the Whitehouse with lies cheating and criminal activity. You will go down as the worst of any .
SB?
Wonderful!! What an amazing host our president is to take everyone on a tour of the White House that shows such class beyond belief
Men men men seas of men
How come only half the team showed up this time? The whole team was there when Obama hosted them. Respect. @cnn @nytimes @washingtonpost
I think the president should find something more important to do with his time.
Super Awesome! Love this Clip!
President Trump is brilliant
Awesome! Winners are attracted to genuine winners
Put Obama's from 2 years ago next to yours , seriously funny
I see not too many were happy to see you! Lol
I hope you mr Trump make a right decision about Julian Assange. He is a hero!
What Did President Donald Trump think about thagt?
Little Whoop to you.  Focus on the big things, and I don't mean boobs.
SOME of the players.
Build that wall, dont let your voters down please
Woo. Hoo.

Some couldn't be bothered to show up due to the fact they don't like you. Go figure, neither does over half of America.
SHAME on YOU and BELLICHICK For USING the PATS
Secure the healthcare website there is a high law suit waiting to happen IMHO.
Let the gov shut down and build a new Republic it maybe easier.

At least someone had a victory, jealous?
Too bad most of their team bounced because you're such a LOSER, Donald John Trump
Yeah how many showed up?
ANZAC Day today! A day to remember all New Zealand And Aussies that died fighting for their mates and freedom of others! Lest we Forget!
Huh?
Fuck the Pats.
Pres Trump is going down in history as one of America's true real life heroes. He's done more in 100 days than BHO !
#first100
that would be less than 1/2 of the players.  It seems the other half (plus) were not excited by the opportunity.  Wonder why that is?
Yea they look thrilled
Half assed turn out 
Kraft is almost as corrupt as you, with all his gambling ties. No wonder you like him.
This is so wrong on so many levels bad things are going to happen
Hard work plus leadership equals ...victory...p3
I thought touring the WH was part of the photo op, particularly if you won the coveted trophy more than once let alone 5 times.
@WhiteHouse yanick
Please take one of the trophies and sit on it.
Lol. That was a small group, eh? Seems the players don't like you so much. Oh well, neither does America
Good for the guys that showed up! We have to stand by our President whether you voted for him or not! My answer to all the guff I heard!
Waste our time
lol, and your man crush, Tom Brady, blew you off like a roadie in Miami but your pride was too hurt to even mention his name. Lol
tRump is historically the MOST unpopular president EVER . . because he is such a stupid ignorant liar.Can't wait til " he gets his justice"
What happened to North Korea #GreetingsFromMexico
Ha to bad half the team didn't show up
I wonder how many of those few didn't want to be there.
Too bad many of the players felt dishonored by you and your disrespectful, demeaning, degrading, speech and conduct were a no show
Wow. Really getting the people’s work done there, Donnie.
Too bad half the team didn't even come lol 
Yup but only half the team showed up.  What does that tell You?  #disasterdon
Thank You for your speech for Yom Hashoah to WJC great speech U made me cry
for those players that didn't show up??-shame on YOU-are uall still butthurt like the rest of the losing party-AMERICANS???
DON - STOP BEING A TOUR GUIDE AND INSTEAD BE A "TOUR DE FORCE"
Did they play the game, lets look for the first lady in the WH
My NE Patriots not looking to happy to be there.  I'm just saying.
Where was your BFF Tom Brady?
Congratulations. ..you continued to demonstrate your ignorance and lack of sensitivity at Walter Reed.
* Keep up the good work you're doing as President and don't let the Democrats get you down. By the way, BUILD THE WALL!
Gr8 2 hear that @realDonaldTrump,my dad was a prominent coach & #1 scorer32pts in nation as a player (played same conference as Earl Monroe)
In our country,":SB" is the acronym of "ShaBI",which means idiots
Um they have 5SB wins so the organization has been there before. Stop saying you gave them thier 1st visit as if they only came because of u
No doubt best NFL teams since the 1970s Dolphins.
Obama was to busy being a REAL PRESIDENT- you have time because you are just playing a part! #fakepresident

The first visit really fake news
These could be for you next tour:MagaMilita, Proud boys, Oath Keepers, 3% Militia... Do you even know who they are?
Do you honestly think they give a shit?
BLACK BARBARA, MR PRESIDENT MAY GOD DIRECT YOUR PATH ON THIS WEEK AND DIRECT YOUR PATHS TO VICTORIES!!! GOD BLESSSSS YOU AND YOURS, LOVVVE!!
No border wall.  Full funding for education programs, including 21stCCLC and EIR.
Too bad there were many fewer players at your party then when Obama was president.
Someone seems desperate to distract us from the FBI's Russia investigation! More and more damning evidence turns out everyday! #DonTheCon
NAH
Too bad so many didn't show.  you know, because you're a racist. #ImpeachTrump
Whatever they are a fucking football team not anything but that! They do not change the world they play catch with a ball for a living!!!
Glad to see your focusing on important things. FOR FUCK'S SAKE, MAN. Be a president!
a football team is your focus right now? you're supposed to be the president. stop entertaining celebrities and do you job!
Where's the rest of them?
Do ur freaking job. #notmypresident #nointegrity #notmycic
They totally deserved it. Go Patriots
Look... there are more people attending this than your inauguration.  Lol
Apparently you have nothing better to do than play with your friends.
In this incoherent rant, Trump says to the cheater coach, "I couldn't believe you went for 3!" They went for 2 stupid!
滚犊子
Doing a faantastic job. Proud to have voted for you.
*less than half the players
Because you don't live there.
Less than half the players cuz let's get one thing straight most of our NFL champions couldn't stand to be in the same room as you
Mr President speak your mind
keep up the good  work for the veterans & America
Cool
Tiniest crowd of football players in history. Sad! No one likes you!
Lol, Obama has more of the team at WH. Face it, winners don't like you.
haha, so not even half of the team showed up, heard Brady's wife is working on an anti trump rally that's really why he didn't come.
Just another reason to hate the NE Patriots
Where was the rest of the team?
I want to tour the house. But just a Dream
