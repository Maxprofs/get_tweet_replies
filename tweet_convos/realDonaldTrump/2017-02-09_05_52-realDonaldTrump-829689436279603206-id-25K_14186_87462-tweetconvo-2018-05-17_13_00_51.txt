def a failure. The leader targetted is still alive. U killed a US soldier, 14 civilians, and an 8 year old US citizen ...
President Trump has changed the course of America. We are winners, not losers. Don't let Sen McCain's negativity take over!
Certain Americans prefer being whinners vs winners. So be it.
this country was amazing until you caused anger and divided it. You will cause #ww3! Our @POTUS is #sad #resist #RESISTANCE
just WOW....
.@realDonaldTrump I'll take McCains word on successful military ops, a veteran who has been a POW, over yours.
McCain has proven to be a lying liberal pos
Proof? Evidence?
When did the winning start?  This operation sounds a lot like Benghazi.  Did you have adequate intel before authorizing?
#TrumpYouAreALoser 
You will continue to lose
you killed 30 civilians, an American child, and lost a SEAL. That's a terrorist attack, not a win.
We would win "bigly"  when you are impeached.
Grow up. Be an adult. Your lunatic is showing.
Then quite making your clothing line in CHINA AN TJ ,
And give the American people the job of making your stuff ,
Obama got bin Laden, you got the U.S. military kicked out of Yemen. Winning! #impeachtrump

what's a trool?
@vicberger Trump cant grow facial hair, Low testosterone ! Sad!
Lucky, those small hands would struggle with a razor.
Don't want to overcharge your android device?
Spammer!
Ryan served heroically regardless of the mission's success or failure. We don't win just because you say we have.
Time for you to #resign #liar #sociopath
You are going too far now. You don't get to casually tweet about a fallen soldier.. Shameful.
St. Mattis!!!!
kendinize dikkat edin halkın desteğini kaybetmeyin unutmayın tek güç millettir
@POTUS no compren nada de la entenada ivanna trump q se vayan a tomar por el trasero
I agree 100%
deep r spect for our fallen and none for your cavalier dinner table decision.  Your Obama moment of glory backfired.
I beg you....please stop tweeting!
You wouldn't have any clue as you were in the residence prancing around in your bathrobe.  You hair was mess I here.
Smart and winning means smart power and its judicious use Sir; not brashness
send your kids into danger and then tell me if this mission was a success.
We're you watching Get Smart last night?
a 9 yr old publicvideo and did not get target. Mattis said that after you urged him. You killed ppl w/o enough intelligence
up is down and down is up in your world? Take your meds!
. @realDonaldTrump is insulting a war hero again. He will pay bigly.
his service doesn't make him infallible in perpetuity.
Besides, HOW MANY DIED IN WWII?  We consider that a win on our behalf, right?  McCain is a tool.
McCain should resign. Hey snowflakes, I'll come to you so you can tell me your anti-military and @POTUS comments.
..Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a "failure." Time for the U.S. to get smart and sta...
honestly I expect nothing else from McCain the traitor.
I support you 100% keep up the good work I know you are for America even tho the snowflakes tweeting without a brain don't. Snowflakes funny
Murderer
So you think a 72 yr old is going to change their ways...lol...you're adorable 
Obama gave billions to a terrorist country. Don't trust his people he appointed to any government position
That was Iran’s money to begin with!
Then we'll need to impeach you. BTW, have you seen a doctor lately? You used to seem more intelligent.
work hard Mr president to stop world wars ...stop the funds for groups that latter turns to be killers
LOL, "winning mission"
how about looking out for the people like you promised. The sick, elderly,and  the poor.
"Saving House Speaker Ryan"  movie in real time now... 
time for everyone to stop fighting and work together
liar

You're lying, as usual.
god bless sir watch your back in my prayers sir
Right Mr "So Called" President, US does need to start winning.The best way to do that would be to throw your ass in gaol.
Sen McCain is a Hero not a Failure like A Traitor elect president of United States
NOT what Ryan's father thinks. Why didn't you have the decency not to use his death for photo op as his dad requested?
start losing again, you mean. We're losing since you became President. U didn't win u lost
you are a  sad disgusting duchbag Mr. Prez!  What about his Gold Star father??? SEND YOUR SONS TO FIGHT!
When a wife or family says they don't want to be there after saying no twice for u're speeches.
U need to watch movie "Taking Chance"  Ask for it, or where it is on streaming movie channels.  Don't ever do this again.
You shouldn't wear an American uniform, you should be wearing Russian…YOUR FAKE & A TRADER!!!

I hope the WH made a copy of the tribute for his children so they can hear their father honored by the country as they grow
If only you could've seen what happened in WWII
http://viid.me/qv7T1r 
I suspect Ryan is embarrassed by the negative connotations his father is putting on his work .. stay the course sir !!
.@realDonaldTrump #Responsibility for the death of Navy SEAL William "Ryan" Owens rest with YOU, his #CommanderInChief. Don't like it? Quit.
NO HE DIED CAUSE OF YOU, THE MISSION WAS A FAIL. INNOCENT CIVILIANS KILLED http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ryan-owens-seal-raid_us_58b58852e4b0780bac2d58c6?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 …
Well, then we need a different president

Winning requires strategic and tactical planning. Get it yet?
Only you would claim a "win" while disrespecting the military and making no comment on the loss of an eight year old. #fail
#FailedMission
at the rate of your "winning" we will need the draft back due to lack of military personnel.
According to McCain the Normandy invasion wasn't successful I suppose or countless other victories.
two face hypocrite you said let the states decide on cannabis and now your breaking your promise.
Yes if you consider the needless slaughter of 9 children a winning mission.
That would require a new president. Are you offering your resignation? #Trumprussia
It was a failure. Just learned the Family did not even want to meet with you. Just a shame.
America has always won Hey you have protesters in The UK They don't want you there Why are you not talking about that REAL
what about the Kid...and Other innocent people ???? You suck trump boooooo
so much winning, so little time
just keep lying to yourself. Or is this what #PresidentBannon tells you at bedtime to make you feel better.
he and others died for your ego. You're a horrible horrible person.
and the Hindenburg was a successful trip.
who won?
AMEN.
- "losing so long" is PURE BS, produced in your D-world! McCain has taken wins & loses like a man - which YOU CAN'T DO!
That's going to be hard with a loser as POTUS. #LoserInChief Even the Scotts think so-wait I mean Scottish!
what is it about wars that keeps u awake at night? U ever think about doing positive things ?
30 children killed, 1 SEAL, and you missed your target? That is winning? Who are you Charlie Sheen?
He didn't die on a winning mission. YOU killed him. You thought it was a pissing contest with Obama and KILLED a NAVY SEAL!
#FAIL
To label a mission where a SEAL loses their life as winning is asinine. Have you no morals. #despicable #URtheSwamp #leave
lie lie lie lie LIE
You,a draft dodger sent him to his death. YOU ARE a failure in so many ways!
Oh please #tinyhands, the majority of Americans know you fucked up, and it was a failed mission. No point lying. We KNOW.
he died because you bumbled the mission!
@SenJohnMcCain logic of lives/equipment loss = mission failure means WWII was also
Wouldn't want to tell WWII vets that!
It is shameful in any context regarding sacrifice of our military who serve(d)
What the fuck do you care about soldiers? You hired a man who planned attacks against US Marines. @realDonaldTrump
by killing pregnant women and young children? you really call that winning???
...I wonder if Navy SEAL William Owens family thinks mission was a "success"?
soldier killed, innocents including an American child killed, Yemen banned US ground raids going forward: abysmal failure.
our hero should never have been sent on that mission. His blood is on your hands.
we will start winning when you are no longer number 45! Do America a favor and #resign #resist
hey, Get Smart reruns...best watched in a bathrobe
How dare a sitting US President trifle w/loss of life this way!! Horrified!! Everything is NOT about you!!
because  of your  incompetent  actions a family lost a son.  Shame on you, S.O.b.
Start winning again? We have yet to start winning anything with you in charge
His death is on you, and you alone. You signed off on it.
apparently we can just say we're winning and that makes it so.
wow...yet again acting like a schoolyard bully instead of a president.
.... damn right it is!!!
Grading on a Trump University curve, are you
you promised winning then you lost a helicopter, a navy SEAL, and all credibility.
because you have the attention span of a gnat, a member of the armed services and many civilians died.  Investigate
Stop sending troops to die on missions with half-baked intelligence.
I'm sure that Hero Ryan, is glad to have died in a winning mission. Maybe trump is delusional, but not fake news.
1997 interview w/ Stern,"I feel like a great and very brave soldier." bcuz u, supposedly, didn't get an STD in the 70's.
Tell us about your "glorious" military service. Oh, sorry, I forgot about that "foot thing".
sad when a presidents celebrates a death of a soldier. Declaring it was a winning mission.
Same mission Obama wouldn't approve because he is way smarter than you?
why is that the biggest coward on the block talks the talk Trump is a draft dogger. Prove us wrong send your to fight
every time you loose an American life is automatically , A FAILURE ! And more when 30 innocent humans die ! including kids
Ryan died in a poorly planned mission (according to Ryan), not a "winning mission". Time to get a smart President again 
which of the Obama staff signed off on your failed mission? The answer is none. But keep producing lies: history remembers.
Hmm.  Trump lost twice in court.  Ivanka lost to Nordstrom.  Doesn't sound like winning to me.
You botched it big time!
the mission was a failure. You failed to get your target, you lost men & equipment, & you killed CHILDREN! #TotalFailure
USA is loosing because you are the President, PLEASE RESIGN AND GO LIVE IN RUSSIA YOU TERRIBLE LITTLE MAN
Understand you HAD to say this. Still sad you did. U.S. has to kick their habit of  slaughtering OTHER people's children..
In addition to Ryan, several women and children also died. Pls stop murdering civilians in botched ops
what would you be saying if that were YOUR son? Oh, wait, they would never serve...
John McCain needs to resign. His statement was horrible. Why didn't he say anything like that under OBummer
US soldier dead, civilians dead, old computers seized, target got away. Sounds like failure to me.
Slaughtering 30 civilians, an 8-year-old US child & a SEAL, +being banned from Yemen doesn't sound like a success. #Idiot
you call the death of 1 of our own, and killing innocent kids a "winning mission"? Where's your strive to do better? SMH
How about you get smart and don't kill people?
U didn't even bother 2 go thru proper channels generals appealed 2 your ego U took bait. The Fox = generals & the Crow = U
Cool! When are you resigning? That'll be a major win for every nation.
May God bless Ryan and his family.Sincere condolences to them.May God shed some grace on the ungrateful.
You failed Ryan, his family and made a huge mess for nothing.
Why not try showing love instead of hate and fear??
