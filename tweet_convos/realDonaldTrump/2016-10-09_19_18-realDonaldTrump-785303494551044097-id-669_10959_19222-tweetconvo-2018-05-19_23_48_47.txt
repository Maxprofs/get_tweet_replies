Drop the "red line" stuff. The US is the aggressor with no right to be attacking Syria.
Hillary wasn't there when Obama decided against attacking Assad in August 2013
, your contribution systm only allows $15 and higher. Its keeping people from sending contributions to you. $10 more offten
both of you are deplorable! #VoteJillStein2016 #VoteGreen2016
your totally wrong about that, Races getting tired of being screwed by Democrats! Wising up!

another lie by donny duck hair cut
I was shocked after watching debate #2 when I heard she never answered her phone when our ppl were in trouble!!!! disgrace
The Red Line? The chemical attack was done by ISIS mercinaries paid for by the Mossad to try frame Assad for it.
@AngDonlon @TheAtlantic Mr. Trump, we all know she is a liar and corrupt. Stay on point with the issues. We have your back!
Selective memory like with FBI.  She can memorize nasty comments about you and Americans though...  #Trump2016
But while she was there when red line was drawn she was not there when it was crossed. I hate Hillary but be accurate
<------ #racist #deplorable #blocked
Amazing what manic Hillary remembers & what she forgets. Folk with poor memory shouldn't be psychopathic liars
in reality Bashar Assad did gas his own people. The so called rebels did it and I believe Hillary was behind supplying them
I meant to say Bashar Assad did not gas his own people.I believe Hillary behind arming the terrorist rebels.
4 20 yrs we R aggressor so Putin reacted/now say he's guilty of War Crimes/U.S. broke out 1 wk B4 Treaty/ WAR eminent
fk you
that means we win
And it was crossed in August 2013, after she left.
and trumps furniture  gifts and Pu $&y grab that got him in trouble
fact#pussy grabbing trump is a rapist. Don't fall for his bullshit lines.
Another Hillary lie,,,
This debate is so different. The CEO meets Washington politics. He's in a league of corrupt crooked politician all of them.

hey that ain't a pu $#y
Leave #Syria End the #USA Illegal Invasion, nothing good will come if the US stays.
And we were prepared to invade for that red line and Obama let us down.  Big surprise there.  We must help the people.
@new_debis @TheAtlantic #HillaryClinton is a liar extroardinaire. Her vocabulary excludes the word "truth". #NeverHillary
ya her line is pink
.@realDonaldTrump @Trump4Hope U have ur work cut out 4 u fact checking Hitlery, it would b easier to find a truth!
@TheAtlantic

She is a big problem with us and Mr.Putin she will keep throwing her trash at him. Togetherness is needed
I thought you wanted to stay out of the conflict??
HIllary will casually and blatantly lie about anything. She told many lies at the debate.
What will you do besides say what a great leader Putin is for bombing hospitals and children with double and triple taps?
In all fairness, she wasn't paying much attention when she was in office.
for 26 years, Okidoke d and lied, took $$$ from Wall Street, ME, etc.
Was drawn 1st. Violated AFTER. Liar.
@sandraanne324 @TheAtlantic I guess she couldn't remember when she was secretary state like meant things
Hillary lies!!!!!
if you become president we might as well kill ourselves
Reading comprehension: line drawn in '12, but decision to hold bombing made 1 yr later.
The President makes those decisions not the secratary of state. Take a civics class you koron
She deserve jail and was in overhead when Sec State.  She is weak and feckless go Donald!!!!]
She lies again.
Maybe Hillary meant she wasn't there MENTALLY.  That would explain quite a bit. #Benghazi
Nice joke, DT is talking about fact...
So does this mean you've finally talked to Mike Pense about Syria? Do you still disagree with him?
she was there I remember!
you're pathetic is that all you got, you're very uncreative which is why you're free falling in the polls
@TheAtlantic red line wasn't crossed until August 2013.
@TheAtlantic 
Grab her pussy
https://youtu.be/Dqn0bm4E9yw 
Hillary mentions ISIS 2011
@TheAtlantic what she lied again? Say it ain't so
@TheAtlantic she just keeps on lying
EVIL IS BEING UNLEASHED...AND PAUL RYAN IS A PART OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER GLOBALIST....MARK.

Lyin Hillary
@TheAtlantic You don't know the first thing about Syria & proved it at debate. You don't know about American govt either
@TheAtlantic  take her down with Benghazi and our 4 dead Americans she cared nothing about
@TheAtlantic the question isn't when he made the red line comments. The question is when he failed to enforce the line. Duh
@HillaryClinton
@collins_trading SERIOUSLY AMERICA! Is Corrupt Hillary's excuse BRAIN FREEZE again?
@TheAtlantic what where the sniffles last night?
Check again
You're either dumb or a liar.  I'm betting on liar.   Assad crossed the red line under Kerry.  

http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/hillary-clinton/clinton-and-line-sand-comment/ …
The clip you linked to has JOHN KERRY as secretary of state. When red line was crossed, Kerry was Sec of State. FACT 
Not true - you really do not know the meaning of a fact
@JerryWact another I don't remember! from @HillaryClinton  how can she be president? She so conveniently has memory lapses
This is ridiculously misleading: you fail to add that the red line crossed AFTER HRC left. What BS.
@TheAtlantic OF COURSE WE KNOW SHE LIED SHE TELLS SO MANY SHE DOSEN,T KNOW THE TRUTH
@TheAtlantic hahahahaha
@SunnyAtTheGulf graters Rowley ever in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania sounding more powerful than ever hallelujah
U accused Clinton of being there 4 Obama’s “line in sand” in Syria. She wasn’t. U're wrong. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/us/elections/fact-check-debate.html#/factcheck-26 …
Yeah - just another Hillary Clinton lie for sure!
Hillary was Secretary of State at THAT time... "wasn't there"?!?!
Ha!
@TheAtlantic shock!  She lied again!
@tradethecycles @TheAtlantic she dosent even remember she had a job then!
@TerriMathes @TheAtlantic Mr Trump if you supported anything even without the power of a vote in Congress,you're complicit.
@lsferguson @TheAtlantic
@TheAtlantic ... AS USUAL, LIES!!!
@TheAtlantic you don't want to fact check. You lie like a rug every time you open your mouth
@TheAtlantic GOP shills. Honesty and facts are not your strong suit. 43 lies for you last night fact checkless
@HugaDream @TheAtlantic BOOM
@TheAtlantic SHE HAS A VERY BAD MEMORY AND DOUBLES DOWN ON LIES
@TheAtlantic just another lie
@TheAtlantic since she couldn't "recall" questions to the FBI 36 times, to her lying self, she was telling the truth!
Good businessman = debunked
Intelectual curiosity = zero
Respect for the people he wants to lead/victimize = zero
WTF?
inconvenient fact-Jim
@TheAtlantic you didn't know what the red line was you buffoon
- You do not deal in "facts". You ONLY deal in LIES. That is all you understand, and all you are capable of understanding.
Watching from Aus.The US media needs to be held accountable. They're not even trying to hide there bias.  #AmericaFirst
Mentally she wasn't there, too busy filling the foundation coffers before resigning. :)
@ErinBSullivan Is she insane?Doesn't she know that fact checking would prove her wrong?
fact. g.w. bush was the one who signed the peace treaty that pulled our troops out and left the void and not Obama. idiot
Fact. Repub congress refused to let Obama us missles on Syria and refused to give him a war authorization.
she wasn't in #Benghazi either
@TheAtlantic maybe she was sleeping.
Bandar Bush supplied rebels the chemicals, they discharged. 1st time in 300 yrs UKparliament went against its PM recommend
I read somewhere HRC signed the okay of the Sarin transfer from Libya to 'Rebels' in Syria. @realDonaldTrump @michaelharrisdr @TheAtlantic
http://www.globalresearch.ca/hillary-clinton-approved-delivering-libyas-sarin-gas-to-syrian-rebels-seymour-hersh/5522647 …
@LindaSuhler @TheAtlantic ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!
Fact, Syria didn't used chemical weapons.  Al-Qaeda did.  They video-taped themselves doing it.  The U.N. even had to admit
@TheAtlantic Hillary lies again!! Or Brain failure!! Lol
#She's too busy counting foundation $ to worry about that pesky Sec of St job!
honestly why r we talking abt Syria!! It has nothing 2 do w the USA I'm tired of this shit. I need help w.my student loans!
@TheAtlantic TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT

Hillary always trying to run from her record
@TheAtlantic fact check you will never be president. Jaja
@TheAtlantic Fact #Trumpwantstobanghisdaughter and #Grabthembytheirpussy

HERCULEAN
Donald Trump BOTH won debate
AND Diffused Hillaryan antiRussian hate & race toward WW3
Russia fully mobilized
Also why hasn't HRC been held accountable for failing to acct for 6 Billion dollars of the taxpayers $ at the State Dept?
If all the illegal BS was out in the open it would take till after November!!! Trump-Pence 2016!!! Truth n Dems are 0%!!!
Didn't HRC ask you to fact check this lie? The timeline doesn't lie. BTW why hasn't anyone pointed out that HRC quit SOS.
@TheAtlantic The boomerang truth just hit her. 'Wack!'
@TheAtlantic You forgot, everyone just go to her website. And find the fact check truth  she has said so many lies. FACT!
When she said that I knew immediately that she didn't get her email on that one. :D
@TheAtlantic caught llieing again, maybe Comey will come to the rescue?!
Could you fact check yourself on your statements?
Obama sent a crate of money instead
@TheAtlantic Need a steady flow of exposed lies from 30+ years of the Clintons The 50% of un-deplorables should know! #MAGA
not surprised by her comment.
You even lie about a fact check. Good grief. Go away.
Red line?  Another lie from Hillary Clinton. She was still there until 2013. Lies, lies, & more lies!
Trump Foreign Policy Adviser Has Ties to Brutal Lebanese Militia
@PhdFor short circuit in Hillary's brain again
I am very sick in the head -Hillary
@TheAtlantic maybe she was either gathering wall street $$$ or out sick again and forgot the red line!
She consistently lies.  great job last night
@TheAtlantic you have to #clintonparse "I was gone" Depends on what the meaning of #gone is #gone potty #gonecrazy #debate
that should have been #gonepotty
@TheAtlantic that red line Obama drew in the sand that was American blood which he & Hillary DISGRACED & STILL DOES& WILL.
@TheAtlantic She didn't let Syria break the line. Fact check on you
@Big_AL_Nakba Enough w/US lies, ruining of populations, allies of terror & slave nations. 

What have we become? #Syria #UN
If you told us what Hilary's "hemisphere" means, you might divert our loss to a world
without borders, etc
Just another big fat lie! It is hard to understand her support. The emails alone should have disqualified her+jail time
I think with Hillary it will be easier to just lie check her there are barely any facts to check with her.
lol. NOW you believe in facts? How convenient.
Fact Check: You have done NO public service. Just spent your time running companies into the ground and assaulting women
Never Trump
@ABC did you fact check this? No of course not!
@TheAtlantic  Hillary nothing but a blatant liar! American has caught on to your hustle Hillary! Damn con artist!
@TheAtlantic
@TheAtlantic John Kerry was Secretary of State in this video...whose eyes are you trying to pull wool over? Your supporters
Now let's look at your fact check numbers.
.@realDonaldTrump Hillary lied, AGAIN!! I knew you were right when you said it, but didn't want to turn from debate to look it up. #TrumpWon
Bingo
The fact is you don't have a plan.All you have is blame.James Woosley your N security advisor just dropped his pants on CNN
@aniggeronachair @TheAtlantic     
 HILLARY LIES She Kept saying, go to MY WEBSITE 4 t TRUTH
Disturbing part was her psychopathic perpetual smile during her deleted email portion.
No one fact checked her during the debate....
She lies and we all know it!
HEY @HillaryClinton you were there! liar
Yes we know she lied again that's all she ever does
Hillary just can't help buy lie about everything.
yet why #ivanka #chelsea #bestpals?
Yes, she got her timing on that one wrong. They ALL say you lied about EVERYTHING!
you just lost a whole shit load of women votes
Hahaha classic the "It wasn't me" tactic.  Good ole "honest" Hillary...
@TheAtlantic Just like the lie she landed under heavy sniper fire?
didn't even watch his own link. SecState Kerry standing right there.
@TheAtlantic 
That Line in the Sand made América look weak in the eyes of other nations
@TheAtlantic If only you knew what you were talking about Donald.
did you actually watch the video ? It proves you're wrong. John Kerry was there in it.
when was it CROSSED??? DRAWN is irrelevant.
@Amberis4LSU @TheAtlantic HRC lies again and again. Why no push back from 'moderators' on this one? So dishonest and biased
Hypocrite in chief
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/opinion/campaign-stops/trumps-second-debate-in-brief.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&smtyp=cur …
watch the tape.  Said line was crossed while John Kerry was Secretary of State as evidence by said tape used to fact check.
@gatewaypundit @TheAtlantic twitter not allowing RT and taking away also. Have to quote to RT. Rigging for Clinton
@TheAtlantic what...another HRC lie?  Say it ain't so.
She cannot help herself, lying is in her DNA
@Bohoover Another "Mistake" or "I don't recall" convenient explanation !!
"If it's a negative, I didn't do it." #CrookedHillary
@TheAtlantic the bombing in Damascus was in Aug 2013, not 2012. Get your facts right. Kerry was in.
