This movement has happened, like all other movements...at a place and time when it was sorely needed. #MAGA

You are using Surkov tactics to create a constant state of destabalized perception. Putin tactics. Hence the chaos. https://m.facebook.com/notes/barbara-mcdonald/confused-by-trumps-stand-on-the-issues-there-is-very-much-a-method-to-his-madnes/1473460062698269/?fref=mentions&pnref=story …

Thank you. Important read. This is what America feels like right now.
Gee THANKS @morningmika & you GOPklan beau @Morning_Joe 
joe tried on being an independent for about a week. didn't fit. so he's sticking to being a terrible musician and misogynistic #morningjoe
Up to 180 million spent on visits to your golf properties? https://www.salon.com/2017/09/29/tom-price-resigns-for-private-jets-but-trumps-golf-trips-are-far-more-expensive/ …
Don't forget, he said he was going to be too busy for golf. How many times did Trump pillory Obama. Hypocrite.

As Mayor pleads for help, Trump congratulates himself on Puerto Rico response, heads to golf course https://goo.gl/6fwrvJ  
@RogerWilliamsTX @SpeakerRyan impeach trump now-he's unfit for office-you are too if you stand by, watch him let Americans die in PR
#PuertoRicoGenocide
Go play golf for the weekend Donald John, you've earned it. 50+ tweets for the week, ethics violations revealed, & Puerto Ricans dying. WTG
Football, Luther Strange, Healthcare, Tom Price, Kushner emails, Puerto Rico...it's astounding how badly you fucked up in just 7 Days.
I'm impressed with how well you can look directly into the camera and lie through your teeth.  You really are good at it.
So your venture in Puerto Rico went belly up? But you raked in the cash. Aren't you special.
Of course this is when we had a real President. #ImpeachTrump
They are so busy robbing our nation blind, none left for citizens in need
But they have no problem spending $2.4 TRILLION on tax cuts for the 1%.
670 billion on military who he sends out a week after the incident despite starving and dehydrated citizens!
Trump disrespects Military again. BADLY twisted Gen. Dempsey's ideas (exact opposite), left out & twisted words.
#FakeElection #FakePresident
This.
Just heard you are at Bedminster again this weekend. Have fun, relax. Remember that Robert Mueller and his team are working diligently.
Meanwhile, the situation in Puerto Rico remains critical. Listen to the words of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz:
#YOUBITCH
#Spy org of  #NorthKorea, #Chongryon are funding the #Nuclear dev.

Need to prohibit the $200B #Pachinko business owned by Korean in Japan.
The #Pachinko casino business owners in Japan are funding the #nuke #ICBMs.

The Pachinko business is owned by #Korean families.
We need to exert pressure on Japan to prohibit the $200B #Pachinko business in Japan.

This Korean owned business is funding #KimJongun.
A lot of Puerto Ricans voted for you I know cuz I talked to him and told him they were idiots now they believe me
Yeah that will be fascinating.
Your exposing ppl who think they run USA,they r scared,angery politics=not saying what they mean] U do
Please save Puerto Rico.
I can't wait until they pass your tax bill Mr President!  They better pass the tax bill or they won't be in Congress anymore!
Had to keep this going because it's so very true!
How many people have quit under you? Your legacy as an embarrassment will live a long time that I can tell you.
#resign #pos
When I detect a Porcine Patrol on the horizon.
People died in Puerto Rico while u played golf.

Response from this admin has been abysmal & shameful. We r a great country that has always gone to the aid of others. U make us small.
The entire world has heard the ppl of Puerto Rico say no help has trickled down to them. U make us small in the eyes of the world.
@POTUS We Love Your Weekly Addresses!!!
Yes we do #CloserNation

The #TakeAKnee obsession also.My son is in Japan in the Navy right NOW. I'd like to share his words with you. How dare trump speak for him. 
Oh Colleen ... wouldn't it be amazing if trump actually read this? Do I think it would change anything? No. But it could plant a seed. 
@realDonaldTrump cant protect the US since he owes #russian bankers and has money laundered   #obama was firm   #trump is WEAK...
#TaxPlan
I have a solution to get the Democrats on board w/Tax Reform:
Agree to raise the taxes of every single Democrat,
& just cut everyone else's!
Im bringing pop corn......with buttah!
#losertrump proves he is an ignorant bigoted racist pig by his own words and actions he is letting Americans die and suffer fact
So the #USA supports #Saudi who behead people in chop chop square but hate #Assad in #Syria where women can vote drive & hold cabinet seats?
Prayers and Much Appreciation for my @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 
Ummm? Your #WeeklyAddress full of #lies #fakenews and #fables of your #accomplishments... yeah, #NO...!
Was this recorded during a golf session. dOnald, history will remember you as one of the most dispicable humans of all time.
。你好
Not a chance we're too busy getting u impeached

Illegal Aliens Cost the U.S. 135 Billion Dollars Each Year. Here's the breakdown of how that money is spent. http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/27/the-cost-of-illegal-immigration-is-at-a-record-high-here-are-the-numbers-you-need-to-know/ …

I talk to all my Marine Corps buddies none of them see you as the commander-in-chief you're the joke and chief
Fuck that wall! Organize relief for Americans in Puerto Rico! Mayor of San Juan is BEGGING for help, for  Christ's sake!
Dr. Suess had predicted a Trumpian America around the late 1930's-early 1940s in his political cartoons.. #Resistance #TrumpRussia
Pachnie gorzej niż komuna. Ten sam trend co w Polsce. Populizm na świecie jest wszędzie taki sam. Natura ludzka jest przygnębiająca.
Not in a million years.
This is your legacy. You went golfing while Americans begged for help and died of cholera.
God help us. 
There is a Cholera outbreak in PR. Stop golfing and get to work.

I'd rather light myself on fire
I'd rather get a root canal
I'd rather swallow acid than listen to this traitor.
BRAVO MI PRESIDENTE! BRAVO! I never get tired of screaming my support for MI PRESIDENTE TRUMP!!
Will do if you promise to impeach yourself right afterwards....
I'd rather punch myself in the face.

Very disturbing that DOJ and Sessions are not taking any action in the IRS scandal. Message to all bureaucrats: Do your worst. #loislerner
Judge Jeanine asked Jason Chafetz  about Eric Holder.  Sessions says he's not going after Holder, the IRS and not going after HRC's emails!
no one cares what you have to say
#losertrump shows his true self again he is an ignorant racist pig lets Americans die and suffer because they have brown skin fact

Weekly Address & watch you blame Tom Price for Obamacare failure? Lie about how great Puerto Rico doing? Lie to middle class about tax cuts?
I believe in God and Lord Jesus Christ ,but I am greatfull that I believe in you Mr President of USA Donald J Trump that you are Great -
Rather eat shit than listen to you.
Is America great, yet?
our @POTUS 
@TruthinGov2016 Sounds like Good Tax Plan2Benefit All! It would behoove Dems who want2help their Constituancy2Get On Board

Not. A. Chance.
I seriously hope you have to personally feel the consequences of your inaction.
How are the people of Puerto Rico supposed to see this address if they have no power?

You embarrass our country every day. The mayor of Puerto Rico cares about her people. You care about no one but yourself. The mayor of Puerto Rico will be revered while you will be reviled.
Fuck you.  You're a bloated racist asswipe.
I like that there’s so many cuts in these bc you can’t string 3 coherent sentence together
You are one of the greatest American Presidents ever!!!

Thank you for keeping the American people informed about progress in Making America Great Again #MAGA in your weekly address President Trump

WHERES YOUR TAX RETURNS?
THEIF
Corruption,collusion,lying,pending lawsuits and always more pending and investigations,revenge at the NFL for denying tubby a franchise.
We can't stand to hear your very, very annoying voice for 1 second, what makes you think we could stomach 5 full minutes? #LiarInChief
A traitorous moron with learning difficulties? Are you serious? Why would anyone waste thier time listening to your mendacity & corruption?
Thanks, but I'll pass. I can do without your live regurgitation of Fox News.
Weekly address  packed with lies and bullshit  No thank you.
#TakeTheKnee #DotardTrump
What? He can string a sentence together? I thought it was a spelling bee contest. Why am I always the last to know?


Donald Trump is the best president in the history of the universe 
Matt.25:40: "..to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me."-Jesus.Puerto Rico.
You haven't impacted the people of Puerto Rico in a positive way in the last 9 days of their humanitarian crisis.

San Juan mayor: "I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out the logistics for a small island..." 
I want to meet u sir...please please please arrange sir one time please please
Id rather eat my own heart

Mike Pence sent lawyer to secret meeting with special counsel on Russia investigation

WORST PRESIDENT EVER! Get off the golf course and help our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico!!! #Lazyshit.
That is a spectacular idea! Keep in touch with the people, and help them stay informed, straight from the source and not through media!
Are you going to explain why you completely botched the response to Puerto Rico and U.S. VI?  No?  Won't be tuning in unless you resign.
Use your five hours and DONT PLAY golf tomorrow and work on Puerto Rico.
Where is the Help for Puerto Rico? They need help yesterday...
Not a chance in hell.

follow Cocky Tom Price for a long walk off a short pier #Nazi #WeakLittleMan #impeach
You are a major disappointment
For your supporters
I am not shocked
Just embarrassed
No words will ever explain what you have done to the people in Puerto Rico.

Nothing you do will ever make it right.

To listen to more lies + self congratulatory bs! NO thks!
if I wanted a dose of ignorant incompetence I'd go to the local republican club meeting. Resign!
Join you for your weekly address of BS, I didn’t think so.
Are you on drugs? Seriously.. what's wrong with you???
People in Puerto Rico are dying. #ImpeachTrump #failedadmin
LOVE @POTUS 4 MANY reasons: 1)NOT a politician 2)  FIGHTER 3) PATRIOT 4) HONEST 5) STRONG Leader & MOST of all, HE LOVES US...the PEOPLE
Sir,check exactly me...someone may modify
This is on @GOP - the inept racist tax-evading draft-dodging treasonous sex offender  mobster “president.” This is all you, @GOP.
No thanks, I just ate.
Why would I do that? I'd rather get a root canal with no anesthesia.
#TRUMPISGETTINGITDONE
I didn’t watch this but can guess the content...

I'll be busy watching the desperate situation in #PuertoRico. Who could have seen the need and helped organize assistance 9 DAYS AGO? hmmm



Enjoying your vacation while people DIE in Puerto Rico? #Dotard
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS is a mentally weak individual that feels the need to threaten people to make himself feel like a big man .my opinion

#dotard #invokethe25th
US reponse to Haiti earthquake, 2010:
2 days
8000 troops

Donald Trump is exponentially the worst POTUS IN HISTORY!!!
Lying from the very beginning of his campaigning. Very sad.

I'd rather masturbate with a dildo covered in peanut butter and fire ants.

Eric Trump for president 2024!!!!
Thank you for your service
#TrumpSwamp  The fact that you appointed these Swamp Monsters, shows your Poor Judgment & Incompetence. #FirePruitt #FireMnuchin
