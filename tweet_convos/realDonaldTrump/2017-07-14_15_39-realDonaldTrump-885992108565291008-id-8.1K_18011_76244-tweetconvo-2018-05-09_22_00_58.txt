France is being over run by refugees who are causing hate and destruction! We don't want this in America! Follow our values or don't to USA
Thank you for inviting melania and me.
Love  President Trump forever. My 95 yr old mother & I pray for your blessings & protection from harm & evil, sickness &diseases.
France can suck it. They only need us when they are invaded. #MAGA X3
Revolutionary War?

President @EmmanuelMacron, Thank you for inviting Melania and myself to such a historic celebration in France.… https://...
Long life America 
Vive la France 
Thanks to President Trump and Melania Trump for their visit and their attendance for our Bastille Day. #FrenchAmericanFriendship
Grammar correction...
"Melania and I"
But then again you would not know anything about proper grammar..
it's actually "Melania and me"...
Or her and me and him and I if dunce-oh is also including Mel and Fr Pres .
"Thank you for inviting Melania and MYSELF..."??  Really?  I hate to be grammar police, but POTUS needs ESL class.  
Mr. President,  it would be great for us to have a similar day for our Vietnam vets ! They came home to protest, spitting, couldn't even wear they're uniforms for which they just earned!!! Let's give them a welcome home parade! 
THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES, MR. TRUMP!
Your work means so much to us!
It's almost like you don't sleep! So much work gets done on the day-to-day basis!
The fact that you did more work in 3 days than Obama in 8 years is simply incredible!
Er. Like what exactly
horse's ass
Just awesome...IT'S like a movie, and the title would be.....WINNING AGAIN, A COME BACK STORY !
TRUMP TRAIN 2020!!!
Nice job Pres.
Er ..he does know what happened  to the RICH guys then?? Not good...
Don't forget Macron is an EU Globalist
How come you don't email or call him and thank him? Why are you tweeting everybody to thank him.

Can YOU Guess Who LEAKEDThe FAKE #Russia @POTUS #Trump Dossier To #Comey?

None other than #SOROS Funded John McCain!

…
Don't forget this asshole was pardoned by Nixon for cooperating with North Vietnam
Melania will not write the book until she divorces you. And then you'll deny you ever married her
Ironic that the President of France invited a fascist to his nation.
When did he invite Antifa into his country?
To #BASTILLEDAY
So proud of you My President! Thank you!  #GodBlessAmerica #BastilleDay
Wow beautiful.
Melania and "me," you dolt.
Are you sure that English is your first language? Me and myself doubt it. #idiot #sad
Your global approval rating is 22% sad!

You are a traitor!

You have a lower approval rating than the word moist
PUTIN, YOUR SON, YOUR SON-IN-LAW. Every day more lies & scandal. IMPEACHMENT NOW!
Wish we could trade you for Macron
You can't have him, we need him to help stop this stupid #Brexit crap the racists have foisted on the UK!
Waiting for the liberals to start commenting hate....
and there it is 
There u go always up front with the folks. Love it. Bronson.
I cannot stress enough how completely Trump supporters believe the DNC is somehow responsible for the Donald Junior meeting. It's gospel.
Little donny is in trouble, donny
Like father, like son. wouldn't have expected any less.
Yep
His blind supporters still do. That 35% is all he & GOP care about. We'll see if that's enough or if the GOP leaders will regret!
True, I figured an email that obvious would erode some of that support....maybe audio or video will change their minds...maybe
I'm got a feeling more than that email is coming.
Yea they are really bad criminals...Im sure Mueller has a lot of dirt
Next time have more respect with his wife, pedophile
Have you preemptively pardoned Jared and Junior?
No only Obama pardons criminals. Trump locks them up
No...trump hires them.


LOL. No way you tweeted this yourself.
Who else would it be?? 
Dear, he has a team that does this for him too.
Of course, as did Obama...  Just a celebration of Bastille Day 
Take out the "almost," and we all agree
This is how the world sees you
Can't wait!
#ObamaWasBetter
Obama didn't now shit man stop being dulusional. obama care is a distaster which fines people and lost 3 million Americans their healcare
Today a history professor? How many different personalities are housed inside that tiny orange skull of yours, T-Money?
T-Money...that may require artwork. 
Donnie Two Scoops - There has to be ice cream emoji letters!

I thought @Castantine could spell out 2 scoops with it 
"Scoops" and "Money" will be tough. O, M, N, W, H (anything with two sides) use a ton of characters. I'll play with it. See what I can do.
Sometimes I have to get really creative with how I format them to squeeze it into 140.
Lol not u. I'm #MAGA.

America deserves better than #PresidentTrump. #TrumpLies #BastilleDay
And, what has he lied about? What has he done that's damaging to our country?  Nothing. Stop complaining, and deal with the losing you get.

Amen! I haven't been this proud to be an in decades.
That's actually pretty damn sad.
Who asked you what you think?
Well...when you post on social media on a president's wall, you pretty much opened it up.
Yes, but not for negative b.s. I don't do that, it's just stupid
Let's help remove the #maga people from office ... basically all GOP
They found the smoking gun against you Donny, and your son basically gave them all of the evidence. Will you leave him out to take the fall?
Here you go meme makers... do your worst!

@KellyannePolls
3 Years, 6 Months, 5 Days, 18 Hours, 20 Minutes, and 46 Seconds
Until he wins a second term....
Keep smoking whatever it is ..when you get out of your brain fog he and his crime syndicate will be gone- do they have golf in prison?
You're the one thats smoking whatever it is. You literally just spewed delusional BS. "Crime syndicate"... you mean Hillary & Obama???
When Fox starts questioning lies, you gotta know it's bad.
Incorrect. Fox is always fair and balanced. Harvard reports that 52% of trump coverage on fox is negative. Versus 93% negative CNN/MSBBC
And since @POTUS' actions are negative about 93% of the time, it appears @MSN and CNN are right on target.
Did you stop shaking Macron's hand before your return, or did he have to fly back with you?
I'm sure everyone's wondering if the US Open athletes look as fit as Macron's wife. Maybe you can tweet about that later!
Part of me really likes the highlight reel and "hey, kids, I just left the grocery store" tweets.
It's like reading a 4th graders twitter account. Just not as articulate.

*Melania and ME.
Here's another unemployed Libs. POTUS find him a job, all he does is tweet replies 24/7.
"I have like a very, very high aptitude." --DJT
"I always did very nicely in English." --DJT

POTUS is a very, very big liar.
YAAASSS he should've asked Barack for contact of his public speaking class. Forget it. I care about what he DOES FOR THE COUNTRY
Despite a fine education, he writes & speaks at 5th grade level. Language is the foundation of intelligence. Trump's foundation is cracked.
Thanl god he didn't sell Russians our uranium for nuclear weapons like Hillary did w/Barack's blessing.
People say he tried to sell his soul to the Russians. The deal fell through however when a title search showed the devil already owned it.
Hell ya & Michele said 'Barack, when they go low we go high', took him swimming with Virding's Branson to help hidrate his devil's soul
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron
Media: The world hates us because     of Trump

The World: Thank God the USA has a real leader again!!

Too bad the guillotine was out of order.

Do you even know what happened on Bastille day?
Improper use of the English language
Thank you for allowing me to escape to your country. I can't take it here in the US.
Why Billionaire Barbi thinks she can fool Americans with her arrogance and sense of entitlement is amazing... what an arrogant fool
You're just a wonderful leader Mr Donald 
My regards from North Morocco
You are welcome! 

Why does FLOTUS not know she's wearing a hair-do that resembles The Alien?
I'm sure they were glad to see you go. You need to learn the proper way to shake hands and how to behave in public.... disgusting.
how does a person forget over 100 people on a security firm.. and what about you??? Lies .. and abuse of the presidential office
An historic
Oh yea congrats on being their AND getting trolled by a France president #idiotinchief #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow #Impeach45
Shame you humiliated everyone by commenting on the French President's wife's body!
@IvankaTrump We need MONTHLY Military Parades complete with missiles & HUGE review stand for Sweatshop Ivanka,Skinhead Eric&Transparent Don.
And I bet he thanks you for objectifying his wife. I bet she appreciated it too. #sarcasm
Gag
Face facts, your entire family is corrupt and anti-American!
Ivanka Trump’s brand collides with her mission:

After comments you said to his wife, he doesn't want you back. World embarrassment. SAD!!! BIGLY!!
Rentre chez toi fils de pute
Mdr mentionne pas
Mais ptn c le nouveau twitter je comprend rien c trop nouveau pour moi
Mdr ça va je te pardonne alors
Its too bad you don't know history.
Melania being really lovely and charming.
They invited Melania and you just tagged along.
No one there likes you.
I'm sure he would have preferred Obama but oh well he had to play the hand he was dealt
Mr President does amazing speeches.
Finally a real American Patriot back in office. Thank you Mr. President! @CNN #CNNFakeNews #CNNBlackmail
It's "Melania and me", not "Melania and myself". That Ivy League education was wasted on you.
Creepy
C'est plus beau que chez toi

France hates you espèce de gros fils de pute
Incorrect use of reflexive pronoun. If you said "I can imagine MYSELF in prison" - that would be both accurate and correct grammar.

J'enmmerde les abrutis dans ton genre. Et ceux comme Macron également  Vive De Gaulle ! Vive la Résistance !
you are so ig'nant. Try "Thank you for inviting Melania and me". Sad! The POTUS can't even make a compound sentence! SAD!
It was a nice reception.
This message on twitter...really cool. France gave my son and daughter a free education...we salute you France.
Melania and ME. Your grammar sucks.
Thank you, Mr President. The US and France stand fast, together, against the Islamic Extremist Terrorists. @realDonaldTrump
The still of horse's asses is appropriate.
Nice self portrait. Oh, sorry, that's a horse's ... rump.
Well said Donald!!!!
Thank you Macron for making him look like a jackass again.
Nothing you do is historic except the rapid decline from nothing to less than nothing in your presidency.
Now they believe and agree with us.  There is a clueless buffoon in the White House. America is sending out an SOS to the world.
Yeah. He had to settle for you because Putin was busy.  Thank God Melania didnt show her breasts and thighs, just her ass (YOU).  HA!
It's incorrect to use 'myself' in a sentence that does not also contain another first-person pronoun such as 'I' 'me', or 'my'.Embarrassing.

So, what kind of side business deals did you make while on your political trip?
I used 2 love seeing AF1. Now it's been reduced 2 a garbage receptacle, taking it on, dropping it off. It'll have dignity back one day soon.
Great Speech

Why does this sound like a line from Austin Powers?
YOUR HEROES FOR PEACE! LOFTY LIB GOOFS NEVER MISS A CHANCE FOR THEIR NO SHORTCUT CONDEMNATION OF WHATS HOLY
Poignant video! Love it. Thank you @EmmanuelMacron for invitation! Americans salute you & France for this opportunity.
Just love how the videos starts out with a bunch of horses' asses
yes new president of France is more statesman than you will ever be, you are not capable, traitor liar conman thief grifter robbing U.S. sad
God bless you. Vive la France  Le Grande Marche. @Bangalter

Grammar
And you were nothing but an undignified insecure sophomoric buffoon the entire time
@perrymason888 A country with great health care. A thinking articulate president and an educated First Lady. The USA. Not
@SHSanders45 @EmmanuelMacron What a embarrassing disaster you are.RESIGN before you are convicted of OBSTRUCTION&COLLUSION!

Hope you enjoyed your weekend. You could have complimented YOUR wife, as well. A very attractive woman.
But what about freedom fries?
Vive les États-Unis d'Amérique, vive la France !.
It's a shame you couldn't keep your cheeto butthole closed when speaking about Mrs. Macron. Stop objectifying women based on their looks.
Did you discuss France's universal healthcare with Macron? TRUMPCARE KILLS (per OMB). You LIE and eat way too much. GET TO WORK lazy loser!
@DanScavino did you produce this video? Love it
You missed a comma and a period, pendeja.
Prior to your next foreign visit, get yourself a protocol coach, use campaign funds and get a good one, yellow pages.
@IvankaTrump @EmmanuelMacron #IdiotsAbroad are now #IdiotsHome
Trump is useless
Boy Melania doesn't look to happy,forcing her to take part. Thought she wanted to be a MOM???
How does it feel to be the daughter of the most hated person in the world?
Beautiful!
Keep in mind that Lafayette was pre-revolutionary France. Thousands were murdered in cold blood. The "Terror" was real, model for left.
Ce fut un plaisir...Notre pays doit beaucoup aux américains.
How great is our president!!!
Let's agree on one thing, marijuana needs globally legalized and treated as it is a recreational vice as well as a medical cure for children
Melanoma looked gorgeous
Melania and ME, you imbecile. Learn to speak English.
Too bad they didn't extend it by 3 years and 6 months eh Donny Boy?
God Bless France and God Bless America
Should of stayed in France longer
Awesome video showing the fraternity between our 2 nations, whoever our presidents are.
From France with love.
 
Mon dieu,  Monsieur Macron: You were supposed to keep him! We did not want him back!
I heard there were 200 bicyclists rushing towards Paris just to see the Oaf of Office.
I'm a Trumpansy!!  I just saw this word today lol... to funny
Please you and your family
Nice to see you with the new leader of the free world.
And thank you for hitting on the Prime minister's wife with him listening. You're a class act. #impeach45
When I saw all the horses rear-ends I thought this video was going to be about the #DNC
More horses at Bastille Day than people at your inauguration. 

Just saying.
Get that wall going boss!
Perfect photo! Which one of those horses' ass are you? #25thAmendmentNow
Wonderful. Big Thank You President Trump! So proud
Glad they are showing you such great support. Only our own people would. Such great pomp and circumstance. Way to go!!!!!!!!!
Son made of woman made under the law ... Consuelo Leon Garcia  ...  with three death certificates of my mother.
هل أخذ من فرنسا عشرون مليار ايرو لفرد الحماية الامريكيه علي فرنسا
Macron ..felicitaciones es el ultimo gran golpe del sionismo mundial .. en política !! ...
Way to go Mr. President
Grammar.  Ugh.
Proper English is Melania and ME!
While You Jet Europe at Tax Payer Expense:  33Million without Insurance "Billy  Boy" 33 Million
They disrespected my father my mother and my sister as well as my grandma.
Thank you @EmmanuelMacron for putting up w/our current administration. We ARE fixing the mistake made by gullible Americans. #TheResistance
Vive la France  and God Bless the USA  God Bless POTUS
