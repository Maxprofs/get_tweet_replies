I'm getting a sandwich at 10, then someone's coming looking at the flat at 1, so I have to tidy up. #plans
Sure.
Israel has picked up intel that McMaster is reporting to Soros. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS  @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @jaredkushner
Hopefully Trump knows now
Know you're really busy, BUT I'm only 1/2 hr away from you. My wounded soldier son & I could fit lunch in if you're available! 
How to go LISA! Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Nothing to lose @buffalobill06!  haha One NEVER knows! 
I suppose you are planning the menu?

And by 'working'  you mean 'golfing'
Over exaggerating again, Lindsay!
Yeah, sure. Working hard at the golf course. What was that again about President Obama golfing too much? All you do is golf, tweet, eat &lie
The #FreeKevinTrudeau cause? IT IS ABOUT YOUR #freedom 's ...
@POTUS you love #justice right? Well then #FREEKEVINTRUDEAU
Good job, NOOB. Groceries will cost 10 times more.

Donald's tweet reminds me of that time I skipped school for a day and had to cover my tracks.
You may want to consider installing this state of the art security system in the Oval Office to stop some of the illegal leaks.

#MAGA
I think they should go old school, everything type written, all messages sent by courier, cant leak if you can't access
Hear there's invisible #Tags traceable if stuck to paper. Printed items ck. Electronic should be EZE but we are talking #Govt employees!
@realDonaldTrump 
 #FreeKevinTrudeau
Good luck with your "renovation." The White House was definitely in for a major overhaul and termite removal! #MAGA
Working hard at riding your golf cart and crashing weddings. Just say you're on vacation. Geez. And meetings? Hear the NYAG has questions.

Fumigate that White House, brother! Let's #MAGA like it's 1776!
Heard they were renovating the WH bathrooms, including Extra-large, High-capacity toilets to handle the increased bullshit!
Right. Nobody believes you.

Hey thanks for wasting my MONEY!!!

Pretty sad if you have tell us that you're working.
#NationalLazyDay Who else better to honor than @realDonaldTrump ???
Hmm,  will the contractors be fully paid. Or will they be cheated like other  contractors  working for Trump. Enjoy!
Fair question.
a damn tent is to good for you
Ah, ur ambivalence has turned to hate now, lol. That was quite a progression, lol.
maybe a good cleaning and a little paint.
Nope, they are saying it's air conditioning. My guess? They are removing all the bugs Obama/Deep state planted before he left office 
Dons hair dont work in high humidity
That was funny, I'm giggling. Yeah, u'd swear it was a toupee.
Why are you so obsessed with announcing how hard you're working? Do you think people don't believe it. (We already know you're not working.)
Just own it -- "I have done nothing significant in my first 200 days as president, haven't kept one campaign promise, and I'm exhausted."

He looks like a Telatubby
Really?! Twitter suggests otherwise....
Do not trust outside your small circle, beware of the snare. Many have a different agenda. God bless and only trust your family & Pence.
Get out of my state.... Please and thank you.
Mr. President,I know we have the capability to destroy N. Korea's satellites.Why not take them out also why not use an EMP on N. Korea?
You've never worked hard a day in your life pimp
FYI GOP, if you don't repeal and replace, $ won't matter. You can spend like Hillary and no one will believe a word you say!
Pres only agenda, MAGA.  Congress #1 priority is to keep their job (which btw, has great insurance) and keep donors happy....
P.s the Kennedys lived in thr white house during renovations.  Just saying
#FireMcMaster #fireMcCabe #fireMueller they are deep state trying to take Trump down

Yay for you.  Why do you post this crap?
Let me fix your error...
"The Hardly working, Playing golf, Stoking the coffers, Hiding from the Press... @POTUS Trump... 
Blah blah blah.
You'll NEVER measure up to Obama - give up the dream LOSER! You're a lying hypocrite who needs to GO!  #MuellerIsComing #MuellerTime
Dear Lord,

All lies - renovations scheduled AFTER u announced 17-day vacation, per White House. #ImpeachTrump
Sweeping for bugs? Make sure you track them back to the person that had them planted and hooked up to his mansion in DC!
Hey Sniffles...my friend Mamabear and I have discussed the real reason behind the White House renovations! 
Don't bullshit us Americans...and are you renovating the WH in gold like Trump tower...and tax payers are paying for it.
Working hard on that long drive, I'm sure.
Maybe you can call Congress back in session what are they doing on vacation there's so much to be done

.@POTUS Do you have an opening in your meeting schedule on Wednesday, August 16, 2017 around 3:00 pm EDT in New York or New Jersey? #MAGA
Tell your DOJ NO DEALFORHILLARY. She has been at the TOP of ALL this evil used to try to OVERTHROW UAND JUSTICEFORALL
YAY! I've been waiting for pics of your #GoldenThrone I'm sure is being installed in the White House, er, "dump" as you called it.
I knew you would do it!  You are a builder, you couldn't leave it in disrepair!
It will be beautiful again!
who knew playing golf, eating junk food, tweeting nonsense, and being a loser was hard work?

Is that what you frickin care about, right now?? That's for the First Lady , while you're supposed to be busy with more important things!
Working on vacation.  Maybe the Senate needa to take your lead......
"@realDonaldTrump Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation...."
Working on your swing? It needs it.
Chasing young bridesmaids?
Starting a war with N.Korea?
Strongly recommend you stay put and work on your golf handicap. Far more productive use of your time.
Thank you for working for me President Trump. May God give you grace and wisdom in all you do. Amen.
Please sir,  don't announce where you'll be next until you are there, we worrie about you enough with all these haters,  god bless you sir.

#CNN  saying you in vacation. They make me sick... LIARS
Kinda looks like you're spending all your time tweeting, please get to work - lots of low skilled workers need jobs. What's your plan?

Glad you here. The state need to remove and replace Bob Menendez and Cory Booker - do nothing Demo's that have done 0 for NJ #MAGA
Working hard for Trump = Tweeting, golfing, eating cheese fries, fuming about shitty poll numbers
Don't strain yourself!
Working "Hard", Hahaha I'll bet money you can't do anything "Hard" anymore , loser
God bless u President,only god knows what a u doing and how busy  u re   ..amen
Hahahahahahhahaahahahahahajjahajajajajajaj
bwahahaha!  You wouldn't know hard work if it tweeted to you.  Now, get off your golden toilet and try to resist the urge to tweet for a day
You are the laziest President in our history.  Is that golf club to heavy for you ?   Impeach.
Senator Blumenthal actually served in the marines during the Vietnam war and you are lying about him. You did not serve your country.
Go to Camp David. We have already paid for that. You spend our taxes recklessly yet you want to cut funding to crucial services.
Your voters love you, stay strong and drain the swamp! 
IMPEACH
OK.....not planning escape to Russia.....riiiiiight #TrumpRussia
More private Russia meetings. YOU TRAITOR
I have a good ideal for hiring American workers at Maralago.   Tweet it out instead of hiding an ad in back of newspaper.  Hire Americans
Another vacation. More than any other president, including Obama.  Sad.  Bigly.
So they can put in more listening devices President Trump
You wouldn't know hard work if it bit you in the a&&. Pity your handlers only let you tweets sucking up or you'd know 75% of us despise you
You are working hard for us we are so grateful. Thank you . Take care of yourself. We are here for you !
Probably lots of bugs to remove. Love what you are doing for America @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
"working hard from New Jersey" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AKA "watching tv in my pajamas".
Working hard on that golf swing?
Make the most of it. Your days are numbered...
Most people have to pay for a vacation only you would make profit off the taxpayer for your golf clubs
Make sure the WH I scrubbed thoroughly for BUGS 
More meeting? With the Russians that live in Trump Tower? Is that why you pushed Secret Service into a trailer downstairs in Fifth Avenue?
hahahahahahahahahaha
Meetings huh????  Why don't u stay there or lose YOURSELF in the subways and do the world a favor
When did tweeting a shitstorm become part of the job? Idea! Do your job! Healthcare/Tax Reform? Won't get done by themselves! #TheResistance
I know.  I find it really hard to watch Fox & Friends too.
I see your favorite Russian plane met you in NJ! Traitor!!
Sitting in front of a TV tweeting verbal diarrhea does not a meeting make.
By working hard, do you mean golfing? Because that's not considered working hard. Seriously. It isn't.
MORE LIES #ALTERNATIVEFACTS
MAKE AMERICA GOLF AGAIN!

Can't wait till you come back to New York looking forward to your return looking forward to your defense all sjw beware
Do you know how many fans you have in China ? Very much! But I don't like you at all.
I hope the New Yorkers kick your doughy a$$ out of town!
Renovation? Are you putting up tarp so the furniture doesn't get soaked by your urine when you have your Russian hooker parties?
Hey Mr. "Smarter the the Generals", what's the plan for Afghanistan?  Loser
WE SEE
Loser... Enjoy those orange jumpsuits in the Fed prison, sad coward traitor.
working hard? more like hardly working...lol...and you're the guy who bashed Obama for golfing?? Can you say hypocrite? bigly...SAD!!!
Please don't paint it gold 
Being on #Twitter is not the same as working. Someone...call Gen. Kelly!  #stoptweeting #FakePresident Just go #golfing #StopIt #meetReality
Better do a sweep before you get back I bet that place is wired for sound everywhere. Can't trust them. Bring in the de buggers lol
Will you be meeting with any Russians?
I can't tell you how much I hate you!
@realDonaldTrump thinking Pence wanted you gone for 17 days, so could muster up support from WH to kick you to the curb soon...will work 
Dear Donnie,
Don't go away mad. Just go away.
Love,
The Popular Vote
Hope your getting all the bugs out - glad you'll be away -extermination fumes can get you sick
Working hard or hardly working??  (Golfing doesn't count...)
Working hard??  You're either watching CNN or on the golf course.  Phhtttt
60% of the people now believe nothing you say!!  Nice job!!
Working hard??? We can't tell by all your tweeting!  STOP TWEETING AND DO YOUR JOB!!! SAD!!!
This is how I text my mom about my weekend plans. Is America your mom? Are you that lonely?

#LOCKHIMUP #CorruptFamily #CROOKEDTRUMP #RussiaGate #RussiaMoney #Impeach #25thAmendmentNow#CrookedFamily
Obviously not working hard enough cause your tweeting every hour how about do some damn work for the country.
Sure hope they remove all the listening devices that were planted in the WH by BHO/Deep State.  "We the People" Deserve the Govt we voted 4
Hopefully they won't try to BUG the White House again. When the cats away, the mice shall play. Don't trust anyone.

I'm sure at your age and size, golf is very hard work.  Feel free to take tweet free naps in the afternoon, too.
no youre using tax payer money to make yourself more money! #impeach
By working hard, you mean playing golf.............. Right?
The biggest renovations will take place after you TrumpTards are given the boot and the place can be exterminated of your filth & lies.
You are way too dumb to even know how to work.
did you say hardly working?
Adding gold-encrusted toilets?
Thanks Pres.Trump 4being a Patriot&4letting the low-life's comments&attacks roll off your backNone of them would last 5min Nyour shoesMAGA
Working hard? When have you done that? So far you've tweeted and golfed. Working hard #JokePresident #TrumpTraitor
We know you are a hard worker! Thank you President Trump! We are so proud to say you're our President!
Had OUR Employees Worked Hard, I could understand a 2 week Vacation, but a Month & they have Only Sat On Their Dead Asses?  NO!!!!!!
Another one of your LIES!  You don't know what hard work is!  Laziest, most pathetic POTUS EVER!  Just #Resign
You deserve to get away from OUR Nut Case Employees!  It is beyond my understanding as to WHY OUR Employees need a months vacation!
had to get the stench out?
Do you think @SenBlumenthal was thinking about you when he was talking about human trafficking? Interesting timing. You looked tired today.
People who work hard don't have time to rant on Twitter like a pouty teenager.  They're working.
Enjoy your #Vacation Donald....

#TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily #Collusion #Divest #USA #MAGA
Thank You Mr. President!
I just drove by you at the 13th Hole a couple hours ago. The only thing working hard out there was your rug.
Hopefully they find all the bugs while you are gone.  God protect you!
Erik Holderman needs to be investigated
How is your game? Have you fixed your slice problem?
The only thing you're working hard at is doubling up on Viagra and try the Steve Bannon method of self-satisfaction.
That means he playing golf mornings and evenings!!!
Who is 27 year old Hope Hicks? Why is she important to you?

Enjoy your trip to  NY, Donald
Hope they welcome you with open arms.
#rico #suave #trump #humor
Keep making it great, DT! Your friend, Glenn
Mr. President I recommend you not only renovate the White House, but also take it out of the swamp. Relocate it to a city like Nashville TN
You've never worked a day in your life. All you're doing is golfing and getting fatter. Do you EVER even spend time with Barron? LOSER.
No need to explain - we all know the word NEWSWEEK used to describe u is complete bull...that's LAST word that describes you!! #MAGA!
Costs a lot to fuel that 747 for a golf game and a Mar a Lago trip EVERY WEEKEND. But who's counting...
Wait, the media told us you are on vacation!
"Going to New York next week for more meetings."
Please don't. 
Give us a break and stay away. Take your wife and kid with you, too. TY
Enjoy your R & R.  You've really earned it and deserve it.  God Bless.
New York can't wait for you
You bringing a Russian translator?
