@CriswellsOk @CNN TRUMP wins UTAH!
ID counties ran out of paper ballots
Mr. President you won already...
You keep coming up with reasons for why we should have automatic, universal, transparent vote recounts!
Trump is ugly inside and out, but, hey, Putin supports him
@cristo_monte @CNN  I use Trump's tweets to teach my students how to edit writing. So much material-lots of learning!
The day I voted , thats when the machibe broke.
@SarahJTrump @KellyannePolls it's funny how @CNN the only station that has no journalists  has this information 
"We the People" deserve honest news + even more importantly honest voting venues.
Give it up, Donny. In the words of your own lapdogs, it's a "big nothingburger."

Paper ballots may be our best chance +
"officials said it would take some time to understand the problem, as the code appears to be in Russian"
@realDonaldTrump admits that he won illegitimately.
@JimmyJames4Real @CNN with due respect sir a lot of contoversy is going against you,Sir give your best policies to stop
how can one state report issues across entire country?
CONTEST IT MR.TRUMP
Yeah waste a few more million contesting it! Hell it's not like it's your hard earned money right Donny??
It's never been his own since he blew through what his dad gave him.

@JustinThyme_HP @JeffTutorials @realDonaldTrump
And crooked Hillary seems to steel from foundation monies that were for Haiti
Not like this is worth addressing, but her foundation is fully transparent.

You don't know the difference between...state, county, or country...why should anyone vote for you.

.@realDonaldTrump @CNN How did Utah officials get information about what's going on "across entire country"? Don't whine until you lose. Sad

Of course, @realDonaldTrump. Paying people off to rig the election is the only way you have a chance in Hell of winning.
