Republican governors back latest GOP ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/GWldKyf  
Imagine the $ saved by ending just the fed jobs created by Obama Care. It's not a small amount.
HAS 2 B a horrid bill that will lead 2 the death of MILLIONS of our invaluable citizens
& the chronic illnesses of MILLIONS++ left untreated
Every month I pay ridiculously high premiums for Obamacare cuz I have no choice. I voted for REPEAL, not a different kind of forced plan!
I would much more like just a straight repeal of Obamacare! I been stuck with it for years & it's horrible coverage with platinum premiums!
@VP you're a horrifying liar also. STOP!
You'll pass purgatory pal because Hell waits for you
You both are horrible people @VP @realDonaldTrump
Nobody wants that cockamamie bill, you complicit moron.
Lack of leadership by a feckless ignorant President.  He could sit down and work out a plan, but his ass is at Bedminster.
How'd that turn out for you two?  
I guess the lives of 32,000,000 Americans don't matter. #heartless #partybeforecountry #realdeplorables
Thank you.

RT @realDonaldTrump Romneycare (corp. fraud) is Hillarycare (corp. fraud) is Obamacare (corp. fraud) is Graham-Cassidy (corp. fraud). #USA
True but its the most we are going 2get from the Benedict Arnold R's if we get anything at all-Dems are socialist & R's only want2be elected
I'm not willing to "settle" let aca fail.
I understand & agree in theory; but do u think 4 one minute Congress will let it..they will pour $ into it until they run out of paper & ink
Make congress pay (fire them)for ignoring our will. How arrogant for them to think that they know better than me what I need.

It takes a new type of politician to advertise this when 70+% of the electorate is against it. #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
#KillingAmericansForProfit is all this bill is.  Grow up, do your job, and quit selling out to big insurance and pharma.  #AssholeInChief
And you believe that you are a Christian? I hope you rot in jail for your complicity and then burn in hell
The GC bill will cost millions of us our health insurance.  Premiums skyrocket. Call (202) 224-3121 and tell your reps to VOTE NO!!!!
This one is: takes all money collected by Ocare & gives it back to States to use how each State chooses!
And who's going to oversee the states to ensure money supports the ppl and NOT some self-serving greedy republican politician
When the money goes to a State, it becomes part of that State's revenue. In other words, they could eliminate property taxes, if they wanted
Exactly. So this plan has NO credibility just as I thought.  @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
You, ma'am are from another universe. How you see that as a bad thing, I'll NEVER understand.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP 55yrs now Canadians paid in our taxes according2income 2have healthcare. I recently had surgery,radiation&chemo NO BILL
best. He doesn't want to know what the damage it will do to the people he's supposed to represent and protect like you were elected to do as
Shame on all of you......
You’re a killer @VP. This bill strips insurance from hundreds of thousands of people’s whose lives depend on the ACA. Koch Brothers first...
See if you can get the Republican egomaniac children to get something done for America!
You support finding a way to hurt the very people who voted to get you into office. Women should have babies, but no insurance. Right, Mike?
Sure..you take the rap if you take people's HC away and they hate you. Trump playing you!
Here's a better idea.... Let's NOT get it done.  Let's NOT hurt Americans!
When will Trump and reps stop bullying the most vulnerable of America.
Excellent job our President Trump & Vice President Pence, making it happen.
Yes indeed replace & repeal nobamacare. Let's make a healthcare that's works and for the people,God bless Trump's administration to make it!
The fact you don't appreciate the CBO estimates of the millions who will lose healthcare speaks loudly to the GOP's reckless governance.
There are Major insurance providers pulling out of Obama care.
That could be a legislative fix. Sen. Warren covered that recently. Some insurers make $500 million in some markets but want more. #greed
I really Don't support Seen. Warren or anything she promotes.. Thank you for your input, I believe we are finished with this chat.
WE LOVE TRUMP.





Trump's running dark ads promising "A WALL (NOT A FENCE)" for donations.

HE'S USING DONATIONS for his legal fees! https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/trump-is-using-targeted-facebook-ads-to-reassure-supporters?utm_term=.yv7w2mKwD#.udK6XwN6m …
Wouldn't you think a "successful billionaire" could pay for his own lawyers instead of using campaign donations?
R's don't even care what it would do to their constituents!
Not what I voted for... Full Repeal and this is not full repeal! So how about getting done what you said you would do.
everyone in Washington has given up on the idea of practical governance in favor of posturing for the benefit of their core political base
Please never say you are anything but a prosperity christian from now on. All about the ones with the money. A real Christian wouldn't be 1)
Act  busy. Your presidency is almost over.
Tweeting isn't governing.
Fun fact: There is no legal reason Mueller CAN'T indict a sitting POTUS or VP..

GruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosomeGruesomeTwosome #REPUGNANT
...and their constituents don't even know what it would do to them!  How could they?  No hearings...no CBO review...
What kind of man supports taking health insurance from 30 million people? And, what would his motives be?
Over 65 million people voted for Trump because he promised to get rid of ACA. THAT is his motive.
Well, if we're talking numbers and how they equate, 3 million more people voted for Hillary and her policies than trump. Just saying...
What kind of Christian takes health insurance from 30 Million people? Takes from the most vulnerable: the elderly, the poor and children?
Has to do with Govt. not Christians. If gov't gives entitlement programs then it can take them away.Thats the problem, too much gov't.
We the people are the government and we support the ACA.
The ACA is done! Self destructed. Many had insurance but couldn't use it! $2000-8000 deductibles, or it would say office visit-100%ded! 
Then deals need to be made with insurance companies and with restrictions that apply to all
Or we can just lessen the regs some and do away with all of the cronyism. The market has a way of correcting it's self.
That's the problem! Healthcare should not be big business for big profit!
Of course you do! Destroying American health care appears to give you great joy! #noGrahamCassidy
Sadly your disinformation on what destroyed our health care is WRONG!The Government! Have you seen the VA?
Stop deflecting b/c u can't defend how horrible this bill is. If it's so great why r they afraid to debate it; why no CBO score
Without competition prices sky rocket without incentive no more quality care pretty simple. It's not a right. Get out my health INSURANCE
Not to mention there is no proof new plan would even achieve or promote that. Thanks again for proving my point w/ur lies Bye Felicia
What ? You have no point. Socialized med is a joke, EVERYWHERE but hey don't let facts get in the way like yr long wait on a surgery 
We've lived in a nation with socialized medicine. We know the facts first hand - but don't let that stand in the way of your opinion.
MY GRANDSON NEEDS HIS INSURANCE..AS DOES SO MANY OTHERS...IS THIS AFFECTING ANY OF U?  GOD FORGIVE ME I AM SO SICK OF ALL OF YOU !!!!!
If U take away the Medicare & Medi-Cal that I paid into & never thought I would be forced to use U will KILL ME SLOWLY & PAINFUL
No plan. Like Regan. Threw away retirement for civil service. Made thrift savings plan screwed all
SEVERAL repub governors do NOT support this FAKE HC BILL!
@thehill whats americans approval rating for congress veep.  We are not doing something right.
Pat getting rid of Obama Care is the Best option for ALL America Not just one.THERE will be snags here and there to get it right.
So you support the mass slaughter of US citizens by denying them health care. Good to know.
You don't give a crap about us that are FORCED to pay for your free coverage! Repeal Obamacare now! Go back yo free state coverage!
Its NOT full-repeal.  Rescind the ACA Tax, Mandates, and every single world of Obamacare.  Then help the Market prepare for Ins Customers
I would love to see that. But it requires 60 votes. #GrahamCassidyBill is as good as it gets for now.
No, its a LIE just like the Dems did to America.
As long as ACA Tax in place, its RE-DISTRIBUTION aka Socialism
There is no later ... its now or never
Hope those beautiful children r always perfectly healthy or u will have to live w/fact u supported a bill that put caps on their coverage
As Bernie Sanders keeps reminding, US is the ONLY Nation without Univ Healthcare. If true, it would be humane to Deport them home
Wait so we are going to deport you & ur family; im all for u leaving
I don't support this new SHAM Repub Bill at all.  And after the Pelosi shout-down I'm considering shifting my view to Deporting them all
Please Mr. Vice President, convince @SenJohnMcCain and @lisamurkowski to vote for it
Getting nervous, buddy?
No, just a normal sense of worry. Until we have 50 votes we need to run scared
I’m gonna stay skeptical until the thing is on the president’s desk
have compensated for PP defunding. For McCain, he voted against Skinny only after Graham attacked it publicly. Graham is in the name of
If you recall Graham tried to lobby McCain on the skinny repeal
Yes, but Graham told reporters he was only voting for it to send it to the house, and that he hated it. Here Graham wrote the bill
McCain will be likely to vote for this if Graham vouches for it as great legislation. Remember, McCain supported BCRA
@VP and @realDonaldTrump you are the vilest of men to be where you are, and neither of you can see the greater good without your biases.
This all ego and bad policy
Ooh, VP - aren't you a team player.  Hope you really read it and saw how it decimates safety nets for so many future voters!
Yep, good to see how excited you are to remove/kill millions on OBamaCare for a corrupt fake president's (drumpf) win! Ur a national shame.
Who pays for your healthcare? Oh riggght the people you want to screw over - everyday Americans.
Sorry, this is not a repeal and replace.  It is a funding bill to rescue Ocare.  Shifts some $$ to repub states to appease the idiots.
Pence. What kind of Christian are you. Do you really believe that Jesus would approve of what your party is doing to Healthcare
Wicky Pence & Rapist Trump hve supported every plan 2 repeal/replace Obamacare til it fails. U 2 will sell ur mama, wife, & kids 2 get a W!
And you call yourself a Christian-- this bill is inhumane. Christ would be ashamed of you.
If it looks like shit smells like shit you'll support it.
You are crazy
No! The American people say no! Who friggin works for us in the WH anyway? Call your senators
God forbid you have someone with a disability like autism or down syndrome?! Why would you make it even harder for them to get coverage??!
Exactly. They're just giving their donors, PPH, Ins, Hosp etc back their money. Socialist HCare will kill this country.
Why do you never listen to the experts? You make say it's good but you have zero credibility.  Have you even read the bill you support?
Love you guys don't like Medicaid  and pre existing too scary with state local crooks!
Say what you really support. Big $ donors who "donate" to your campaigns for screwing us out of healthcare coverage
Place Your Children &GrandChildren on this Plan if it is so GREAT.
It's a HORRIBLE,  UNCOMPASSIONATE PLAN.
And You Know it! Ask Jimmy KIMMEL
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @thehill $55000 more for health coverage for heart disease Disgusting!
What you are trying to "get done" amounts to murder. What happened to government for the people?

Resign
Just make sure before it passes this repeal/replace is right for everyone! Let's not pass because of the politics! Sorry, I am #skeptical
Let's get this stopped. If you want to replace ACA, replace it with the health care Congress enjoys.
You're essentially punishing people w/ disabilities that they've no control over.  No one wants to be born with a disability but it happens.
For such a devout Christian, you sure love to ignore the whole do unto others thing.
Right on!  Time to gut Obamacare with a real American Plan 
This bill will increase number of abortions. READ THE BILL!
Sorry I can't back something till I've read n fully understand the situation. But that's just me
And you call yourself a Christian??  How many people will have to die before you will work with Dems to improve ACA.
You mean, replace it with an equally bad bill that has a different name? No thanks.
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/22/us/republican-health-plan-comparison.html?_r=0&smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur …
Of course you endorse. No insurance,?. Tell God, he will heal you!. Fake christian
To "Christians" my grandma was a single mom in the 50's. She never went on welfare, no food stamps, ext She showed resolve and fortitude.
You would support this bill. WWJD VP? Not create suffering to line pockets of the rich. @GOP you disgust me.
Get it done so many people are without insurance and the working people need help do what you promise repeal and replace
YOU BOTH ARE CRAZY! GLAD YOU CAN AFFORD HEALTHCARE BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE CAN. MAKE AMERICANS POOR AGAIN!  IDIOTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE!
If you believe in it, let the CBO score it. What are you afraid of?
You really ARE out to kill us, aren't you?
Losers!!!
Maybe you should shut up.  If you are for it, people might figure out it is a POS.  Just saying.
Death clan GOP
You are both heartless. WWJD
RT @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence You were not elected/hired to "go along to get along". Voters want you to deliver on your Promises #USA #ACA
Get The Government Out Of Healthcare, Open State Borders, Allow Competition Between Insurance Companies, But Make Pre-Existing Mandatory Reg
Article I. Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution delegates no authority to the federal government in the area of healthcare. NO GOVT HEALTHCARE
@thehill Because......Evil. You are pure evil.
#presidentdotard 
Now: Ur guaranteed u can buy milk for $2 GOP: U might get 2 buy milk - for $150,000 Trump: Everyone's guaranteed milk by GOP! THATs the lie.

Pence is the person you need to watch he is gunning for your job maybe he made sure you will be  impeached
Only 15
Why does the government insist on running my life?  We need to legalize freedom for once.  Enough of the government run programs.

The next time POTUS makes a deal with the Dems don't ask him why?  Ask John McCain!  He is defying his own governor and his own party. Loser
Yep-loser-McCain can't fly! Gets shot down everywhere he goes!
Why would u support a bill without a CBO report that healthcare professionals don't support and that takes coverage away from people?
Lets get this done and put both of you in.....

NEWS: @ppppolls is out with the first nat'l poll on Graham-Cassidy. It's not popular: 24% approve, 50% disapproval. https://www.politicopro.com/health-care/story/2017/09/democratic-poll-graham-cassidy-bill-has-24-percent-support-162309 …
Causing more devastation that a hurricane cat 5...How christian of you  pffft! #Hypocrite
That's too bad as it's a terrible bill that will literally kill people!
Check out @funder's Tweet:
Do me a favor-share this with Donald Trump. He blocked Laura so we need to make sure he gets this video message. 
Pence, really! You falling for this crock? Get it together.
Governors...that was McCain's excuse before on AZ.. Now he moved the goalpost.
You are nothing more than a parrot and a puppet. Stop kissing Donald's ass and start working for the American people. Read the bill!!
You are sickening! How dare you act like you believe in god then support killing so many ppl! #handsoffmyACA
terrible bill. Republicans suck!  What Graham-Cassidy means for pre-existing conditions
SKREW U!
Let's get YOU done. You're certainly not innocent in ANY of this. 
And hey, Why do you always look like you're trying to hold back a turd?
He's trying to go against anything Obama put in place .,. This whole office needs to be repealed and replaced

How can you call yourself a Christian?
I do not know if Obama care has ever been funded
Get it done before Koch brothers rescind their conditional  $400M RNC contribution. The $ will go farther with fewer living voters to woo.
How's it feel to be an insurance industry shill? Heavenly, I guess.
You are another disgusting person pushing for the most vulnerable to be harmed! #GrahamCassidyBill will destroy lives
How much do you pay a month to help most Vulnerable we pay over 2000 month is that enough?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS POTUS and you only care about a win, not about the health of our nation.
U and illegitimate BLOTUS are bigly IDIOT BOYS
To handle things for yourself, and leave the rest to god, not the friggin government. Oh, and real Christians know that you don't always
@thehill how much are the insurance companies paying you to lie?
Don't you mean kill 20,000,000 / more Americans? #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachPence
No one believes anything you say #FakeChristian
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS to be a Christian is to help the needy.don't take away the help for more money in your pocket.
He left it in a mess for the next POTUS to straighten it out! He said, it's not my  anymore. That's how much Obama cared...he didn't.
Bad idea
How about we send you to conversion therapy and electroshock therapy instead? Perhaps a heart transplant so you can finally have a heart?
REPEAL AND REPLACE!
Drain the swamp !
Free Enterprise is best!
Nope...it's a loser, just like this POTUS!
No CBO score, no public hearings.  Just push a piece of trash through to give trump a win.  Shameful and certainly bound to backfire.
No
Mr Pence All politicians. Should have too have the Same kind of Insurance. We the people have than let's See how quick it's changed JFK 2
Of course you support it. You even supported Trump when he colluded with Russia.
You are just as evil as your boss. HOW can you claim to be a CHRISTIAN and LIE the way you do? #GrahamCassidyNO #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Only if you have to live with the results...YOU USE THE SAME HEALTHCARE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CRAP AT US
Sad to say with the McCain vote, we need term limits more than ever now... McCain should never happened

What's that second word? Replace? Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the word...this bill is repeal and nothing more. It's cruel and absurd
Taking away insurance from millions comes easy for those that have great healthcare from the government (we pay for it).
Mr Pence will you & your family be participating in this program?
This IS healthcare, but giving block money so your State can distribute. Yes, you are covered with preexisting. Forget Kimmel ! RESEARCH !
Let's not and save millions of ppls health care. You only care about donors....CORRUPTION AR IT'S BEST
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @thehill messed up Indiana, now the country, let's stop him before he messes up the world.
You are wrong. Cruel & Evil! Russia Fake VP
If my inability to pay for medication leads to my death, I'm sending you my corpse.
There is no repeal in the G/C bill.
I've contacted my senators (Alexander and Corker) to express my strong opposition to Graham-Cassidy, and I have asked them to vote NO.
Shame on u kissing up to #POTUS THERE IS NO healthcare bill just a win for POTUS. First Do No Harm i bet u have excellent heath care
You want 2take $ from states that expanded Medicaid& give it 2states that didn't, AS A BRIBE 2get them onboard w/ur terrible HC plan. #Liar
