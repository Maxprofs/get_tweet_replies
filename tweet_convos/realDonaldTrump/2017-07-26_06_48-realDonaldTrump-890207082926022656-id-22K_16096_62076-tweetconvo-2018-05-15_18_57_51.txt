 Obstruction of justice all day long! What a dumb ass!
McCabe’s lawyer thanks you for providing this evidence of bad faith on your part.
Quit picking on McCabe. You're just
Scared he will be testifying with
Mueller on the Russia investigation.
You  are so vindictive and punished
Him by taking away years of retirement. Disgusting
Stop playing the CLINTON card and stand on your own two feet. The bus stops with you - We are talking about YOU  not her. Be accountable for your actions and words.
Why now?Why fire McCabe just hours before he’s due to retire w a full pension earned during a career that spanned just over 2 decades(21yrs)
I appears that anybody, any institution that came in contact with the Clinton's before and even now got burned or incinerated-- or death by unknown reasons.  Remember, all Democrats, all liberals---all corrupt. All typical.

.@realDonaldTrump You are the BEST liar #TrumpIsAMorton #ImpeachTrumpNow
All this firing of Muller is not good for you cause it really would be your end


Reason #AndrewMcCabe lost his pension after 20 of service.

As I’ve said before, President Trump was placed as the leader of the free world by GOD himself and no man can remove him because God said,”No Man can stand against me.”
Yes dear POTUS-WHY????  Watch your back!  Get Trey in there, please-I have no clue what this lil elf, Session's, is doing-it appears as "Not too much, right?
-Period!
Oh boy. You got your wish. How many FBI directors have you fired? High turnover correlated to bad management. Guess who’s management? You Mr. Trump. 
#McCabe
Andrew McCabe should be FIRED, period!!
Trump you are going down as the worst BOSS and person ever put on this planet .....Just SAD in how you treat people ...
That's A very good question.. FIRE McCabe.
There is a division in fairness which Congress must stop. I wished I could do it for you all but unfortunately I can't so you all better fix the decisiveness and obstruction in Washington. It can't keep going this way it threatens Americans and the US
The man is retiring very soon, this is dirty politics, you guys are trying to screw mr mccabe of his retirement, remember this will backfire on on your party, the american people will respond in elections
Why don't you impose the sanctions on russia? Oh yeah the pee-pee tape Putin has on #PutinsPuppet
When is America,,,,,,FIRING YOU?
Nobody knows. The only thing I know is: if we had Rudi Giuliani as the AG none of this mess would ever happened, and most probably Hillary Clinton would be singing where she belongs.
I HAVE A BETTER QUESTION FOR SESSIONS! WHY ISN'T HE, MAKING OUT FORMAL CHARGES AGAIST HILLARY? MAKE SOMETHING UP FOR ALL I CARE. WOULDNT BE THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE LIED IN WASHINGTON! "LOCK HER UP!"
Who won in PA??
Well, as usual, the President was correct.  McCabe does not deserve to use taxpayers' money as a pension.  He is a liar and has brought shame to the entire @fbi and everything he has touched.
And why in this world would you think President Trump would be jailed? He has committed no crimes; but There are certainly several democrats who have and do need to be jailed!! First on the list is Hillary Clinton!!
He is deep within the corruption and deep state, he was a plant, just in case you won.Guess what you did, just another insurance policy
Jeff Sessions is just a little guy in a big pond he's no match for the lifers over at the DoJ, they would murder him on a Washington DC street in a affluent neighborhood after turning off all the public survailence cameras.
I have ZERO pity for the "KEEBLER KLAN ELF"....
Obama was the golfing President,he had more holidays than hot dinners,President Trump is the real deal,he is doing a fantastic job for the people of America.
God bless him and his family,he will clear the swamp.
Stand by him.
Best President we have. Hard working indefatigable and love America. #MAGA 2020
@realDonaldTrump
Their getting sacked because they are political thugs.......MAGA
You people don't realize maybe, just maybe Trump has bigger and better things for him. Donald is loyal until you cross the line and trust is gone.
@Eda4elephants he's getting the job done & is not traveling around to all kinds of TV shows like Barack did! To be seen, and tell everyone one: me me me I am great, I should stay president, against the laws Two terms and OUT!  The SORRIEST THING IS HE STILL THINKS HE'S PRESIDENT
@eugenegu  if you never got any patients well, only got "one" well. Do you think you need to rethink your occupation? You wouldn't have a good enough track record to keep you employed .
This too, go ahead President Trump!  Say it! Say it!   You're FIRED!!!! MUSIC TO MY EAR'S!!

@CNN Cuomo, Most Americans wouldn’t call the FBI texts between the lover’s/what was said as ‘Integrity’.  And releasing the memo is ‘a cover up’? I hear what Pelosi is saying, the American ppl are too stupid/busy to understand the memo?
@CNN We have translated ‘Classified’-whatever makes Leftist Elites look bad; and ‘National Security’-is Democrat Security. Also, the memo is false, I can’t tell you why b/c its Classified.

Jeff Sessions used the velvet glove...
Lulled these criminals to sleep.
And now it's all coming down on the whole bunch like a ton of bricks.

Sessions played them.
He knew IG would do his job.
Horowitz was thwarted by Obama's DOJ every step of the way.
I don’t get it either. Read the Memo at the state of the union tomorrow night ,that should be real fun.Bust their Corruption!
BECAUSE . . . the FBI is necessarily an independent organization.  Not a set of goon/enforcers for whoever pisses off POTUS..  Compromise of FBI is first step to a dictatorship.
Attorney Sessions needs to start acting like one or else he needs to resign he has been MIA
Your AG is too old - Fire @USAGSessions
Time to replace Sessions?
Too busy looking for marijuana offenders!
Because they are so stupid! Q told us!
YOU DROVE HIM OUT! KARMA ORANGE MAN, KARMA!
Strongly that the judge closes the investigation on the involvement of Russia in the American elections and bring the culprits to justice
Respect for the courage and integrity of this judge.
Dirty deeds
Are you asking why the person YOU appointed didn't do something? Is this real life? You've had some stupid tweets. But really?
This is the sort of stunt Nixon pulled, we all know what happened to him. Resign.
Absolutely no reason for Trump to resign and feel sure he is not even entertaining that foolish idea!!
There are all sorts of questions you could ask. Why, for example, haven't Ryan and McConnell done their jobs and impeached you?
Because Sessions isn’t going to do anything that upsets Washington. @POTUS made good choices EXCEPT SESSIONS.  Very ineffective.  #replaceSESSIONS
We don’t understand why AG Sessions seems to do nothing!!!!!!
Obstruction of Justice ! @jeffsessions @GOP @VP @SenateDems. We will not stand for it. #ImpeachTrumpNow.
#ReleaseTheMemo #ObamaGate #EndGrahamnesty #NoDACANoDeal
#ReleaseTheMemo #NoDACANoDeal #ObamaGate
#ReleaseTheMemo #FireSessions Why didn't Sessions arrest or indict dozens of Obama Regime felons??? He IS the problem. Weather he's too stupid, too lazy or complicit he should be arrested and charged.
Yea b4 you attack it's "whether" oops
BWAHAHAHA ask Sessions yourself instead of tweeting this crap......it only makes you look even stupider than you already look!
#ReleaseTheMemo #ObamaGate Sessions needs to be indicted.

#ReleaseTheMemo #ObamaGate Sessions is part of the Swamp. They're all depending on him.
Cuz Sessions is on the take. #ReleaseTheMemo #ObamaGate #LoisLerner
Muller time
Trump really didn't want to be president ,but he won ,now he's probably saying ,why in the fuck did i run for POTUS ? Opened up a whole can of worms /snakes on his self
You do know that no one believes a word you say (or tweet) #pathologicalliar #impeachmentcoming #TrumpRussia #MoneyLaunderer
Sessions rolled on you and is helping to get you a maximum sentence but thats just my opinion.
Why don't you ask him? You know you're his boss, right?

Your act is tiring. Please just get down to governing like you're supposed to be doing.
You are just like your dad, just C. T.
You are a fool #LOCKYOUUP

@POTUS @WhiteHouse Why don’t you ask him. Mr McCabe is an honorable man. Why do you keep picking on the FBI? Nobody likes you. Please #Resign #TrumpRussia
For the same reason you have not been replaced, a supposed "friend" of "The Vladimir", a puppeteer to MAGA!
So. Temporary fbi director and now once again deputy fbi director is a collaborrating witness of former fbi director comey. Something not quite right. You seem to like to fire top fbi brass who are able to witness against you.
Interference, DJT wanted him to protect him, but he could not if he'd recused himself for lying under oath..so needless to say 'hand picked' or not.. no one is worth your lively & integrity, reputation(pending they have any of the last 2)..
I'm sure @FBI is interested in this tweet.
Obstruction of Justice, exhibit 4,345 your honor.  The prosecution rests.
Why don’t you resign?
Another great example that points towards Obstruction of Justice! When will you learn that just because your tiny fingers can tweet something out, maybe you might refrain! #MoronsAreGoverningAmerica
Where is @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @JeffFlake @SenateMajLdr how can you not be defending our Country
Why haven’t you resigned yet?  It’d be the only good thing you’d do as “President”
"Drain the swamp?!"  Ha! You're just filling it with more billionaire alligators, Loser.
why?????????????????????
...so you could keep your friends close and your enemies closer maybe?
Donald. There's this book, "Being President." Lists all the powers the president has and doesn't have. Try http://Amazon.com  for a copy.
They ALL have something to hide Mr. President!
Because he's in the swamp Mr. President.
@POTUS 
Clearly you and America have lost confidence in Jeff Sessions. He does not have the strength and conviction to do the job. The illegal activities at the FBI continue to worsen, enough is enough.
What the hell are you waiting for, you should of fired his ass a long time ago.
I have not questioned anthing you have done but on this I am afraid they have you fooled, Sessions is either being blackmailed or is part of the good ole boy club, the new FBI man dosnt seem to be on team USA either. I am not saying they are wrong but it sure smell really bad
Actually Trump is the top cop
You are the boss.  Get sessions in your office and explain what he should be doing .  If he doesn’t do it. Goodbye.
You won’t bad mouth and denigrate the FBI pillars. You’re under investigation and Mueller is coming for you.
Sessions is asleep in the broom closet
more obstruction of justice
Mr. President, I'm begging you -  please do NOT talk to Mueller. Everyone says he's a good honest guy. If he was he never would have hired so many Hillary supporters.
He’s your AG!
#DraintheSwamp #MAGA  #ReleasetheMemo #ReleasetheDocuments
Why don't you @POTUS 
Take a listen to Ed Rollins on @LouDobbs tonight!!
Obstruction of justice!
You continue to question why AG Sessions isnt doing his job The American people do also  Fire him & appoint someone who will go after the Deep State & start putting people in jail  A special counsel is needed to investigate the Corrupt  FBI & DOJ
Why do you still have AG Sessions employed?
Ok, I give up.  Please ask the AG On my behalf 
Who are you?
because @jeffsessions is part of the swamp and is incapable and scared of going after these corrupt swamp rat's
Bring Rudy Giuliani.
#DoNothingSessions
THAT’S what we’ve been wondering!!! Drain. The. Damn. SWAMP! #ReleaseTheMemo
Good ??
Since when is it illegal or immoral to have a wife who has her own separate career (political or otherwise)? Can't a wife raise her own campaign funds, based upon her own positions? Please visit the 21st Century sometime.
They are either that stupid or have Russians up their wahzoo. For your comical enjoyment MR.President. fact is, we thr American people demand transparency. They call us Russian bots. Hardly think Russia is located on Montana. I am American born and raised never out of country
Because the FBI is investigating credible claims of wrong doing by your crooked campaign team. LOL. #ImpeachTrump
Why did AG Sessions recuse himself from a bogus investigation? Why are millions still being spent on this bogus investigation? Time to investigate the investigators!!! #MAGA
@jeffsessions So much evidence of corruption a first year prosecutor would be handing out indictments long before now! AG is in over his head! Wrong person for the job. #FIRESESSIONS #RELEASETHEMEMO #HIRERUDYGUILIANI

More obstruction of justice. Usually innocent people don’t try so hard to discredit any investigations against them. #ShutdownTrump
The president trust the Russians and likes the Russians but Does not trust his own Justice Department and the FBI. Sounds like a crook
fire his ass
FIRE FBI Director Wray now, he is deleting the Texts as he is McCabe's buddy and both are Anti Trump.  Wray is a Bad GGuy
Yes
By the way thank you for the most excellent job you are doing!
Mr. president I heard on tv he did tell Chris Wray to fired him and Chris Wray said he would resign, think maybe Chris is part of the swamp!
Keep your power trip in check
why wont you FIRE sessions he has been a complete failure and if clinton escapes her crimes it will be YOUR FAULT  not sessions  FIRE JEFF SESSIONS
Why didn't and don't you fire them all? It is your authority and your job. Stop with the cat n mouse and end it already!
. Respectfully because FBI Dir Wray has to fire McCabe or Sessions will  piss him off & he will quit. Based on IG report, Wray should take action if facts dictate. #ReleaseTheMemo #FindTheTexts
hello mr. president, did you ever think being a successful real estate developer in New York city would feel like a walk in the park, compared to the crap you're putting up with now? sessions recused himself, not out of integrity but self-preservation, from the clinton cartel !
innocent people don't need to fire everyone who can bring charges against them...
#RESIGN

You would do anything to get rid of anyone who opposes You! Sounds a lot like your Lord and master Putin!!
P
Go cry at the beach, douche bag, and hope your beautiful chocolate cake give you indigestion
You know the saying. (Give a person enough rope)
rather than bitch about things that you don't understand use the vast rescource that is your staff. All that complaining, firing etc seems you don't/can't handle the job. If so, no shame in resigning.
Why exactly?! Why are there ”still” Obama loyalists in government? And if all of Congress take the same oath, to be bound by the Constitution, why in God’s name are there card carrying  SOCIAL  DEMOCRATS “and” members of the NORTH AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY.??!! 
Club-535 lives.
AG Jeff Sessions needs to be fired.  Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe needs to go to jail.  Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein needs to go to jail.  Former FBI Director James Comey needs to go to jail & Former FBI Director James Mueller needs to go to jail.
@USAGSessions is under your authority Mr. President Have a serious man to man discussion about having the courage to do the job righteously and if he does not change fire him
Sessions should have been persuaded to remain in the Senate. He's too sleepy 
Sessions is stuck in the 80’s, still sees the main part of his job as “War on Drugs”. He just needs to update himself and realize crime & corruption have evolved w/technology, so law enforcement must too.  He’s a good person, just balking at mixing new w/old.
Good question, Mr. President. What does the Deep State have on AG Sessions?
It’s time for Sessions to goI’ve always liked him but it’s time to say Jeff Sessions your fired 
USAG Chris Christie, a man who will get the job done.Is it too late to send Sessions back to Alabama?
Good question
Yep, and soon.
Clearly because he is just the same....some people can break the law...some can't
Because I think you and Sessions are on the same page and had to let these people implicate themselves beyond reasonable doubt. The MSM says you have no restraint when you’re unhappy. You’re demonstrating remarkable restraint here. 
I’m starting to question Sessions commitment to our Nation, he’s either part of the Deep State or he’s been black mailed!
President Trump, we are wondering that ourselves.  Any Gov. Agency that is part of the Deep State needs to have the top 4 or 5 top people removed. The corruption is at the top and needs to be eliminated to get back to the rule of law & stop Soros/Obama/Hillary from destroying  US
I'm losing a lot of faith in AG Sessions. Looking more and more like a Leftover from the Obama regime.
Why don’t you fire sessions
