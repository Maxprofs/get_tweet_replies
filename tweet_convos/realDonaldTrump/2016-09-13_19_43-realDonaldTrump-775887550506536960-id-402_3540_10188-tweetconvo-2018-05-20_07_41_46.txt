Why haven't these republicans backed the demo when they try passing the policy?
 Lies Lies Fact checking
its not innovative, at best its regressive in tone and minimal in action
The really dumb backing the really dumb.
yeah ms nc had affair in dc with a Senator  yes we trust her
if you can't raise kids without government help, you have no business raising kids
it's not an entitlement. Duh
What do you know about child care?  Your children were raised by nannies!
middle class, like me, would have not even been close to covering child care expenses under your plan.
too bad she got kicked out by her own party. Wow Republicans  you suck

Didn't she lose in the GOP primary? Nice lame duck ass kissing LOL
Bill and bill
I'm in NC and I'm not crazy about some of her stats, like on being pro-life, but voting otherwise!
Doesn't help lie income families, no paternity leave, funding questionable.
#nevertrump

a poor plan and an empty promise. It is as good as his promises to pay his contractors.

Important note on Trump's 6-week maternity leave plan: it's NOT full paid maternity leave. It's a safety net: 6 weeks unemployment benefits

Thank you from a mom /Nurse you have my vote now
Not you. Surrogate tweet.
mi mi future presidente
what a joke this is just smoke and mirrors....
Right On! There is no reason why the US hasn't done this years ago. Even the leader of 'Women' Hillary hasn't offered Jack.
Why is Rep. Elmers writing a press release & not working for her constitutes? You asked about Obama...
I expect Rep Ellmers to support #WomensRights moving forward, including gov't paid leave for maternity.
@potus Obama cannot rally disinterested Dems. Voter turnout for Trump historic!
Release your taxes!!
I can't wait to cast my vote for you come this November 8!
do you really think these help? Lol you are so unaware.
@anthony5505USNVQ-1
Renee recognizes the need for strengthening the family unit again. Help for inner city issues, too.
Glad to see our Reps taking a stand for freedom!
Orangutan Fuhrer Trump, did he ever pay his employees maternal leaves? ?? Just to get Vote! Pathetic jerk!

Hilary has no childcare plan, traitor? Haven't you mastered GOOGLE?
How much did you pay Ivana to shut up about RAPING her? #DeplorableLeader
The reasons for every caring American to vote #TrumPence16 by a landslide!
New mothers can already take six weeks of maternity leave.
I have noticed that after each rally/speech you have thanked listeners & participants.  HRC thanks nobody
Blah, blah, blah... So Elmer Fudd endorsed you? It's a start, Donald!
So ur really crazy? Thisexplains a hell of a lot!

#Trump's new #NanniesForTheRich plan; tax $ benefits rich more than others.

RIGHT, YES!...TRUMP-PENCE 2016!!!

Innovative what a joke.  Most companies give 12 weeks leave. Tax cut for the poor = $0. They pay no taxes.

It all begins at early childhood.Rear them right&you later get someone who is responsible, respectable,&socially productive
what a HUGE leap forward that is wonderful
Hillary is not appropriate  man for president. she is now on tress.

This guy spends more time on Twitter than most high schoolers.  Needs approval for everything he says.
Commie party.  We might as well keep O.  Maybe vote for Hill now. What is the difference.

Would that be functionally Pro-Choice @RepReneeEllmers ?

another deplorable?
how are u gonna pay for it?  @IvankaTrump doesn't provide paid maternity leave to designer of her clothes
Well, the 1977-1981 born term "potus" is bad, but the President's "LastNamecare" is better, said Nominee.
#TheseAreBoring
what's the child care policy @ Trump Corp?
in order that mothers are able to safely house there children while at work there needs to be support/push
lol... Your campaign looks !Ike it wrote the statements for them.
This plan gives nothing to low income parents, only to parents in Ivanka's income bracket. So Trump!
