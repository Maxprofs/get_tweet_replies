What? No jobs that have been in the works for two years to brag about as your own today? LMAO
Buckle up, Donnie. Once we're done dissecting your failure with #AHCA, it's back to #TrumpRussia.
how about Judge Judy also?
You fool.
I'll be watching snl
#DimwitDon has found his true calling. TV advertising. Resign and go back to peddling your TV show, Don!
Can we just be clear - you wanted people to see this part of her show?
"Paul Ryan needs to step down as speaker of the house.The reason? He failed to deliver the votes on his healthcare bill." #openingstatement 
The bit in which she completely absolves you of any responsibility for the Healthcare failure and totally blames Ryan?
Are we to assume that this is in fact your view? That once again, it's just not your fault?
Are we also to assume that despite her saying that she has certainly never talked to you, that some contact was made?
I'm just saying, it's a hell of a coincidence.
no coincidence in trump world they should run a Netflix special called making a fraud the Donald trump story.
he directs his cultists drones to his propaganda, how pathetic are the people who can't see through this .
I'm starting to worry about these people. They're going to have meltdowns when he's impeached!
i will stick to #JudgeJudy thank you very much
Every morning I wake up, I ask, "Has he been impeached yet?" 

Stop ruining the world.
why would we want to watch fake news Donnie?
You truly are pathetic
#POTUS needs to get Judge Napolitano onboard with his Cabinet as AG Secretary

Lol!!! @realDonaldTrump is such a coward he has to let #FauxNews do his own mudslinging! #TinyHands strikes again! @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews
I would rather watch Beavis and Butthead
You just plugging shit now. Are you getting paid for this? You're the 46th President of the USA, not @KimKardashian
dont mark him in 2 spots. 45 sucks enough brain cells from us now.
I'd rather jab a pencil in my eye!
you're such a complete coward.
how ignorant can you be?  She is a schill for fake news and propaganda.
You can't put a crown on a clown and expect a king #Russia LOVES #trump #Resistance
Those two were our disgrace and downfall
3 things: they are black, they are liberals, they are black. Clear?
What???

You suffer from confirmation bias
No.
- Fox "News" is FAKE NEWS.
no thanks, I've had my fill of hacks for the week.
No. That's crap news. She's boring.
You Mean That #fake Judge? Or Are They Only Fake When It Doesnt Go Your Way? You Are A ShowMan/Fraud
Will you be judged a hypocrite for Tryan to spend trillions of tax payers money $$ on a wall while
..happy to let americans die through lack of healthcare
Stand with our president @realDonaldTrump #PrayForTrump #GodBlessAmerica
what for, it's just going to be smoke and mirrors FAKE NEWS!
don't you have better things to do? Like figuring out how to fix Obamacare now that you own it.
First i saw Judge on TV. She is the most arrogant, factless, bullying presenter ever.
.@realDonaldTrump You are the US President. You're supposed to be running the country. Turn off the TV & stop promoting @FoxNews
Turn the tv off. Read a book. Or better yet, read an IC report.
"Read a book" I just love your sense of humor!
pro tip: world leaders don't advertise tv shows. #UnPresidented
I don't like listening to stupid people talk.
are crooked!  If you "paid" me I would not lie for you, but I would take the cash and donate it to a worthy charity.
Are you going to continue denying you said immediate repeal and replace? Like when you said it here:
And here
And here
And here
And here
And here
Blaming Trump's plan that failed because of Paul Ryan and Congress. How special. LOL @MissVikkiV @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews
oh honey, YOUR the special one. Did a helmet come with that bus pass?
Watch news with same opinion as yours reallt challenges you people. Einstein had many quotes on this subject
Obama is tired of winning.
Winning what? 

@realDonaldTrump
I haven't seen a President in my lifetime fail so badly so early in his Administration as Trump.
No one has!

That shrew has nothing of interest to say to informed Americans.  She's one of your pathetic hacks.
Nobody watches that deranged woman!

Trump threatens our Constitution, our freedoms, and our lives. It’s time to begin impeachment proceedings. Join us. https://www.needtoimpeach.com  
Drain that swamp...we the people are sick of these swamp rats
#coward
Who in the world put these crazy millions of dollars to out of country  payments to rulers. Our money needs to stay in our country!!!!
Watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M....
NO THANKS - NOT IN THE MOOD FOR FICTION.
no
Not if you paid me your non-existent billions
Watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M.

Remember what happened last time you told us to listen to a judge on Fox News, Donald?
A reminder in case you forgot bc of, idk, a short attention span or something…
Hahaha. Buzzfeed? Now THAT'S #fakenews.
what's not is Trump quoting fake news from a judge on @FoxNews
Who said that wasn't fake? He's a respectable judge though.
And fox is a real news channel unlike Buzzfeed. Buzzfeed runs propaganda.
They ran fake stories against Trump.
And I think POTUS is completely wrong when he calls NBC and CNN fake news
Sorry, we will all still be too busy chewing over @StormyDaniels’ appearance on @60Minutes, as brokered by her excellent lawyer, @MichaelAvenatti!!! Hey, come to think of it, Donald, I hear you’re having trouble finding a lawyer — maybe Avenatti could recommend one!
) to push your corruption, evilness, racism and lies.  Now, how about that big money you gave her...no wonder she lies for you!  All of you
This tweet violates principles, norms and #IANAL probably a few laws, @jack @realDonaldTrump stop this kind of abuse @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews
She is too old to be half-dressed sometimes.  Too much makeup (saw her w/o it one day & almost passed out).  No need to watch her LIE (again
Here's the real story on UraniumOne:
So you still do commercials from the white house. I thought that there was some form protocol where you aren't allowed to endorse private enterprise because your favoring one over another.  I hope they towed her car.
having a girl fight your battles for you, Donnie? Bigly cowardice.
Delete your account. @realDonaldTrump
No way man....

Only accountability, 

and all creates THE story
What's one thing happening right now that wouldn't happen without the Presidential oversharing on Twitter. @Jerry_DurhamPT
…. Headlines about trumps tweets!
Huh. You mean we might have more print space and investigation to talk about the things that really matter?  @DrDunawayDPT @Jerry_DurhamPT
are you saying that the tweets, and subsequent highjacking of the media, doesn’t really matter?!?!
there R things happening in the world beyond misspelled 140 char half intelligible sentences? #mindblown
It's a mouthpiece of the propaganda machine that distracts from substantive and maybe unifying conversations. @DrDunawayDPT @Jerry_DurhamPT
Fox News is fake news.  No one with a brain would watch it.
@realDTegtmeyer @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Great job Judge Jeanine!!!!
So when are going to start locking up the Sanctuary Cities Mayors and Governors?
Holy S***.    What a bitch she is!  Never saw her before and certainly NEVER will again!
Nice subtle way of throwing Paul Ryan under a bus, Donny!
Apparently Burger King was too tied up this weekend to offer his advice.  Unpresidented! Sadd!
Losers
thx I did
Do some work.   You are only good at losing.  #terriblebusinessmanterriblepresident
Why promote one News Show over another? Fox is more biased and "fake" than the others you criticize.
you mean watch the corrupt ex DA with the mobbed up husband?
You not only lose but you are a Pass the buck coward! Nice Work!
#TimeIsNow #TermLimits
since he tweeted about this show let's classify it as FAKE NEWS
Pigs...all of you
coward 
#TrumRussia
Sorry no LPT, if I'm going to be lied to, I'd rather it come directly from the horses mouth - You
You are the greatest accident mother nature has ever encountered
Why so she can say what you are to cowardly to say?
I don't watch FoxNews! They are owned by a Republican and they can't speak the TRUTH! "Fake News"!
Now you want us to watch "fake News" ?
so now you're throwing your own people under the bus. What is the point of this?
What kind of coward pulls a stunt like this?  @POTUS #IndependentCommission #ImpeachTrump
Trump is a coward this is how he delivers a message?  What a pathetic disgrace.
@IvankaTrump Hope Russian will take u & ur family--you won't be welcomed here in the US much longer
@mcharlesworth7 @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews craziest thing I have ever seen both lying
you're a fuckn coward!!
Nothin' better to do I guess than shill for Fox News. My God, how SAD
Trump should step down can't even get the support of his own party  enough said
Trump why do this when on tv they are denying you want Paul Ryan out.  Forked tongue?  Sad.  Bad.
Just a coincidence eh? Throw Ryan under the bus and Spicey it will be your time when Donny throws u off a cliff
wow!!!  I forgot how abrasive, loud and pushy she is. So annoying!!!

Why is the President of the United States of America tweeting useless shit like this?!?
you're a coward! You might think it shrewd but you don't have balls enuf to be truthful!
Why should Paul Ryan resign? Thor u said it was YOUR fault for NOT knowing Trumpcare details.It would cost MORE,cover lesd
Talk about throwing the SOH under the bus!  How sly of you.
Thanks for the heads up. She really stuck it to Paul Ryan! Good Stuff!
Another unethical move. Promoting a TV show in your Tweet. Also making Ryan your fall guy.
You are all so obvious & embarrassing... Please resign & move to your homeland of Russia! #illegitimate
The only way I'd lay naked with you would be in a mass grave
anybody that has to put they're "highly respected" in their bio line is a LOSER
lollilol but why
wow, way to grow a pair Donald, having "Judge" Jeanine and Fox News do your dirty work for you.
Judge! One of the best speeches I have ever heard!! THAT'S HOW WE ALL FEEL, MR PRESIDENT! 
i wonder what new policy fox news will come up with this week
You know Fox News is really #TrumpTV as much as they kiss your hemorrhoids.
another Trump blender why don't you quit tweeting
OF ROK-US MILITARY ALLIANCE THREATENED,KIM JONG UN COMMUNIST COUNTRY IS UNIFIED,____
Really...Really?
lol, I heard her say that we shouldn't expect you to completely understand the role of the president
stupidity at it's best.... just to think he got this far.
She is the best!!!!
What a whimp sending in a woman to do your dirty work!  Fake President!
So I have to ask does @FoxNews tip you off or do you tell them what to say? #morecollusion
Dow Jones on track for longest losing streak since 2011:
If President did his job, instead of golfing every weekend, maybe he could have built a case.
So are we to refer to Gorsuch as Judge NEIL, it is like kindergarten, pathetic
can't wait.
you realize you no longer host The Apprentice? If you want to fire people - it doesn't happen on tv!
Just a coincidence that you want people to watch the judge and she starts off calling for new Speaker?  Give me a break!
UR promoting foxnews on a airing where you are not interviewed? Smh, low blow to Ryan.
I did [LOVED the way she ended her speech, bey you did too [if you understood it]
Yes so u can have another lackey deflect how incompetent u r. Jeanine is a reality tv judge ugh
Fox News is fake news. No point in watching Fox News.
looks you don't have the courage or guts to show up on other news channel and be asked hard questio
#Goebbels
Gay? I’m straighter than the pole your mom dances on.
She was absolutely right. Paul Ryan needs to step down as Speaker. You need to fire Priebus also.
You are a weasel.
Soo, you use a failed DA to throw Ryan under the bus. Don't have the guts to do it yourself. Coward@
Good God, don't you have a country to run?  Quit watching TV.
I agree with her on this issue
watched the judge. You need to surround yourself with those that support your agenda just as we do.
Uh-oh, looks like you stepped in it again. Trying to make Speaker Ryan look bad won't absolve you from #TrumpCare
Guess "Buck stops here" days are gone. President takes credit for success and blames others for failure. Sad!
we all know you will be watching
Yes!! She wore her #reddress-->https://twitter.com/Variety/status/846080309703561216 … that ALL my female media contacts I'm sharing
President Trump tweets plug for Fox News host hours before she calls for Paul Ryan's resignation http://bit.ly/2mECjkV
