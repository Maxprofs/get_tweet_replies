the problem is the baseless attacks like this one. Facts matter.
hahaha Yeah so you would go to Trump University if you could? Hahaha yeah right.
you do realize that Trump is known not to pay is debt and that's one the reason he gets sued right?

labor leaders ask you why are you creating jobs in China to make your ties passing up U.S. companies? Traitor!!
I love the diversity of fat old white people

LOSER
Donald, ur grammar is terrible. "Thanks for hosting Pence & I" = WRONG. The correct pronoun is ME. They hosted ME, not I.
Please endorse Term Limits.
your mastery of grammar is your greatest attribute.
That should be "Mike Pence and me", not "I."
Dear Donald, I live here in Pensacola and please remember to give a tribute to the Blue Angels stationed here

". . . for hosting Mike Pence and I"? Did you sleep thru English class? The preposition "for" needs an object like "me".

@conniejimjoe @realDonaldTrump Majority of Americans aren't uneducated or stupidly racist like his minions are!  Thank GOD!!

Will be great to see the FIRST American factory to replace this!  American jobs are coming!
why would someone that always used foreign factories suddenly be good for US factories

I'm sure they agree with you using illegal immigrants for cheaper labor.
Trump says "CHEAP LABOR ROCKS and I am the King of cheap labor"
Trump says "Salaries are 2 HIGH CURRENTLY, I will LOWER wages and Continue 2 outsource jobs  in my companies"
It's "me", not "I". Please learn English, anchor baby.

"for hosting Mike Pence and me," not I. Use "I" when it's the subject, not the object. I'll still vote for you.
oh yes, did you tell them about the sacrifices you made? https://youtu.be/sEqiNIPIPPQ 
Grammar check: Mike Pence and ME, not I.
Another forum for @mike_pence to do "cleanup," explain what fraudulent @realDonaldTrump "meant to say" when dissed POWs, gold star parents
What are you going to do about this Mr.Trump?
Every place I look American workers have been replaced by illegals...what a shame.
All the gas stations and hotels are owned by Arabs.
They work at the state welfare office so they can make sure their people get everything.
They have taken over the work at nursing homes and hospitals,there training was probably free!
They have taken over construction and road work
Most of the workers for the county are Mexican.
The Mexicans are not just picking tomatoes and oranges anymore not in South Florida.
Gee, who is directly engaging with regular Americans? And who isn't? The answer should guide your vote!
Pay attention to which party is well known for "union busting" laws. http://www.nea.org/home/52880.htm

I understand your paranoia, Mr. Trump the Bolshevik

"for hosting Mike Pence and [ME]." NOT "Mike Pence & I." 
Trump's ignorant trying to sound fancy. Pathetic.
u choked in Mexico -Sad- Loser-Fake-25K to Bondi #RICO
We need a Pres who doesn't treat our ALLIES like crap & doesn't cozy up to dictators like Castro,AS we have NOW
And the UAW endorsed #CrookedHRC. 2009, UAW shipped factories/jobs to Mexico, bailout. Hillary's up next.
Both you and Mr Pence are going to realize that you are going to lose this election.
what could you possibly have anything in common with labor leaders
All you did is ruin lives and waste tax payers money by filing bankruptcies in frivolous manner.
Khizr Khan was right that you sacrificed nothing.
You took it for granted by bragging that you always wanted one.
You disrespect our veterans who fought for America. You never deserved the purple heart from your supporter.
Meanwhile, outside of your back room chat with white guys, no press allowed, THIS was happening:
I heard Pence has been training as a ventriloquist.
@HillaryClinton - how does @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence MAGA? by hiring the crooks from Citizens United
The Ideal LEADER for US are the PRIMARY TEACHER, We know WHAT WE NEED to be BIG and Transparent.
Proper grammar: Mike Pence and me.

Yeah, War is their bread and butter. U like war. They like u. Show the taxes. We have a right to know.
an extremely flawed human.His lies are frightening.He will do/say anything to get elected-his supporters r duped or stupid
has so much baggage, he is engulfed by it.  He is the most self serving, narcissitic person who could have been nominated.
Gee, what a surprise. A bunch of old white guys sitting around talking to #DonaldTrump. How innovative, comrade
Are quitting like your Hispanic board?
Did you include labor leaders from China, Bangladesh and Mexico since that's where Trump products are made???
My Grandfather was a Union VP & he would spit on YOU & everything YOU stand for. #YouAreAntiUnion #NeverTrump
needs to make his goods in America rather than overseas. He makes other countries around the world great, not USA
That should be "Mike Pence and me," genius. 
vets hate u! Slimy trump!
Pence should tell us why he created HIV CLUSTERS IN INDIANA.
not a black face in the house
Mike Pence and ME. #grammarnazi
*me*, not *I*. Proper grammar in all official posts would be a good start #MAGA.
