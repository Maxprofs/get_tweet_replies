and how many companies are now going to hold us hostage by threatening to leave unless you pay up with our tax dollars?
how much will the tax payers be paying in subsidies?  Just curious
they are still moving jobs to Mexico!!!!!!!!
So much for poor people are poor for their bad decisions. How can the working class improve when government keep giving our money away?
They're laying off workers and going down...another fail by Dotard 45!!!

Well done #tRUmp! You faked out your supporters (again):
To honor Made in America Week, Carrier is outsourcing 300 jobs to Mexico that Trump promised would stay in America.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/trumps-carrier-jobs-deal-is-just-not-living-up-to-the-hype.html …
If you spent your time getting detailed briefings you could help save millions of jobs instead of 1,000. Great PR stunt tho
Yeah, thanks Carrier, Adios
How'd that work out?
Carrier sends jobs to Mexico despite Trump deal, @onehitGit reports: http://reut.rs/2DlsAoI  
Carrier to fire more workers at plant Trump vowed to save: report #Carrier #Indiana #ThursdayThoughts http://hill.cm/yoM2sPP 
So what has happened Don? Have you made any phone calls on this? I'm sure you can fix this... #Carrier #jobs
Wtf is wrong with you. Nobody sane talks about themselves in the third person   Look it up #fakepresident
338 people laid off from Carrier. You did not keep these jobs in Indiana.
Says the Tyrant Dictator Elect
Capitalism FREE Markets say a company can go wherever the hell they please
NOT your decision
Youre the MORON. FREE market *Capitalism means if I want my company in Timbuktu, POTUS cant meddle in my decision
Trump= DICTATOR
Trump will change the regulatory and tax climate for business. He didn't point a gun to Carrier's head... Bought time.
People need to put parties aside. If you love America, you will stand by Donald Trump. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Did either of you bolt necks support Obama?  No? Didn't think so.

thanks President-elect Trump for keeping Carrier here!

powerful team Trump, @mike_pence n @Carrier! #MAGA
now you jus need to work with cDonalds to keep all this jobs that are going to be replaced by machines.
#CalmMeDownInThreeWords Huma Lost LOL
Thanks #TrumpPence16
that is great news. Keeping your campaign promises before you even become POTUS!
"...darn I'm good...I'm not even Prez yet and I'm kickin' butt...my adoring Twitter fans must now WORSHIP ME!..." #DOTUS
Why are you so goddamned orange!?

var fetoşu bize, sende kurtul,bizde sayın trump
Bırakmam yakani o haini bize teslim etmeden
THANK YOU!
Trump has dinner with Mitt "Judas" Romney tonight. Make it Mitt's last supper. He'd sell Trump out for 30 pieces of silver.
Keep Twittering we knew you would keep your word. News not trustworthy.
BTW its costing taxpayers plenty to keep you safe and you haven't paid  FED taxes in years.
You Sir have accomplished more in the last 3 weeks for the GOOD of this country than Obama has done his entire Presidency!!
,Proud of you!
When will you and @IvankaTrump stop manufacturing your products overseas?
well done Mr President. Not yet in office but making great progress.
.@realDonaldTrump You did nothing. They were already staying. What happens to the other 400 employees? #FredAndMarysBoyIsAFailure
so let me get this straight 

Hillary "email server" = scandalous

Trump "Raping children & Fraud" = ok
Wait wasn't it the Clinton foundation that was caught trafficking children out the country?:)
yeah, well, half the jobs. in exchange for a tax break.
they're leaving 2 MXC 4 lower taxes ovr there. y not b competitive? y not b happy he saving jobs
yeah give every single company threatening to leave a tax break and access to more government contracts!!
you're an idiot of you don't understand Indiana is paying the company MORE money to only keep half the jobs.
Harry may still be out of a job, hey are still exporting 1000 and getting a tax break only the CEO's make out like bandits.
no, you want to pretend that this propaganda is something that is good for America..WE pick up the tax burden for big biz.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump! #MAGA #Carrier #DC #Indiana
Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier
OMG this guy haven't taken office yet and already the country is turning around.
yet Ivanka moves her shoe manufacturing from China to Africa & his companies still abroad
What is wrong with black people in Africa having work?
nothing to do w "black people"-could've been brought to America like Trump promised would do w co/s-can't even do w Ivanka.
I think moving jobs to Africa is more progressive than jobs to China as the people in africa so need jobs
so do Americans & Trump promised to bring back jobs to America. Was not moved to be progressive but for cheaper labor, etc
Trump promising to bring jobs back to america does not mean he promised all his company business would be in USA
.@realDonaldTrump and all you had to do was give them a bunch of government cash! You know, our money!
must be a CNN groupie
.@realDonaldTrump We have no faith in you. #TheResistance
What's this "we", Leftie? Those of us with a brain have TOTAL FAITH IN OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
You can't say you have a brain and voted for a Trump. @realDonaldTrump
please keep this attitude. It worked real well for u guys in the last election.
Talk to me in a year. @DayanaraDelacr3 @realDonaldTrump
Trump said Iraq war was a mistake. Listen to the US soldier crying feeling bad for killing people.  https://youtu.be/gdn3bIfP7fk 
. @realDonaldTrump Threats and extortion, eh?
it's called fair and balanced tax cuts. All red tape & loopholes gone. Which in turn keeps us employed Hugs 2Trump!
That's the lie they sell you. Trump is a master at it.
not, buckle your seatbelt because you're truly in the best eight years of your life he will carry the future for all watch
I've been watching Trump manipulate since 1989. He's sold you a bill of goods.
with Obama/Hillarys vision The communist/democratic/ProgressiveParty will continuing w/more companies leaving, TrumpWins!
@POTUS Wow, this tweet didn't age well either. You gave #Carrier a $7million bribe & they're taking the $ and running. Crappy deal, that
Liar. Mexico got those jobs anyway.
7 million in tax break to Carrier are gone and we are still losing those jobs. So much for making good decisions.
Carrier laying off hundreds of workers despite Trump deal #NationalHotDogDay #MyApprovalNumbersAreLow #Carrier http://hill.cm/F9cFPUf 
Sorry What?
Trump's Carrier deal is not living up to the hype — jobs still going to Mexico
LIAR!!
U r lying again...
#Trump’s “Deal” With Carrier To Save American Jobs Just Blew Up In His Face #FuckTrump #TrumpLeaks #Carrier http://ift.tt/2sGDTTl 
cutting jobs was not in your list of promises 
Where are you today on this @realDonaldTrump Back then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-lDl7RboHo …  Now?
Carrier laying off 215 employees as part of move to Mexico despite Trump deal #WednesdayWisdom #Carrier #Indiana  #JamesWoods #MarkDice #WalshFreedom #infowars #TeamTomi #Tucker #Hannity #YouTheJury #FoxNews #FOXNewsUS #FoxAndFriends #diamondandsilk #MAGA http://hill.cm/rpGGcpw 
Lies lies lies!!!!  He has gone back on his promises and his supporters get mad he stirs the pot with Clinton....wake up America
So that's what, about 500+ of those actually 730 jobs that were on the chopping block that Carrier has thrown down the toilet for a $7m incentive? Oh, and 200 of them are being sent to Mexico? And Carrier is investing in automation instead? Great deal-making, dipshit.
.@realDonaldTrump

EVERYBODY get ready to buy Carrier AC products.  Sounds like they are going to take a stand for America.

#Trump #MAGA
@Carrier. As  owned by the multi-billion dollar corporation, #UnitedTechnologies.Read between the lines, genius.
Do you get all your #FakeNews off social media? Thought so.
Understood. All those Pulitzers are meaningless in your bubble.
You have something in common with #Trump: Neither of you have read the Constitution
WE LOVE YOU, cant wait for 8 years of GREATNESS!
Trump the first president I have ever seen who speaks up for regular Americans
Indiana loves Trump!
Not all of us, and certainly not Pence. Before VP pick I knew him mostly from the FIRE PENCE signs everywhere.
I think you'll be very proud of your new President if you give him a chance #MAGA
I am very skeptical and I won't set the bar low for him. I will after his term if we get through it better with no bigotry or war
When will you start making your products here instead of in other countries? Seems like an awful lot of lost jobs for USA!
.@realDonaldTrump as much as I disagree with most of her tweets to/about u, I’ve gotta admit, this is a good question. @drealities
he makes a few things in this country, but the vast majority are made elsewhere.
I know u don’t like him. Some of his tweets make me cringe. But I’m hopeful for change & I choose joy.
I will like him just fine if he does things to make it better for ALL. If he doesn't, I will continue to hate him.
well yes. No 1 deserves to be treated as 2nd class citizen.
Thank you. My father works in this field and he's elated you did this as #Obama would not have. You are my president! 
y compare?  Each n every Pres loves this country  n tries there very best in everything they do
I have insider information and you don't.
people.  So please don't say that he couldn't do something when I'm sure he tried. Was shut down. See I truly
Question for you? Do you own a business?
a matter a fact yes I do!!!!! I pray for all people
I'm not asking if you pray for people, I'm asking if you legitimately own a company?
what makes a difference what you own. We are all created equal.  I'm very blessed with what I have n raised
POTUS Elect Trump did in a few weeks what no other politician has tried to do in years.  Thank you, Sir.  MAGA!
FABULOUS!!! THANK YOU!!
don't forget to tell the taxpayer in Indiana that they paid the $700,000 bill to keep Carrier in Indiana Not you! 
more freight for us truckers to haul! Awesome everyone wins
& all they wanted to say is "he's not doing what he promised" happy day for Indiana!
nice to know Indiana has a 7 million surplus in their budget to pay for this #win
from now on anybody will buy that ítems in Mexico.
is that clear???
Who knew that Carrier was a welfare queen. Your negotiating skills appear rather weak. #welfareQueen #truecapitalism
Cool! Now all big companies can line up for their share of the welfare you offered Carrier. How we gonna pay for that?
great job! I just need you to explain where the money for the incentive to stay is coming from. Can you do that?
GREAT Job 
President Elect Donald Trump!
now let's bring the Rest of them all Home!! That Spells Jobs
don't forget to repeal Obamacare. I am a widow with  $2500 coming in per month and will pay $1200 per month for insurance.
nice work Mr. Trump. You might have just passed the current POTUS on net job gains. #MAGA
can't wait til your in and obama's out finally I have hope of a better tomorrow ty
First "like" I've given you in my life,  now pick Romney and you'll have two, sir
Joke.  The 150 will thank you.   10 million will still despise you.
fluff
So will Carrier get a massive tax break & still send half the jobs to Mexico?  Is that a win?
half the jobs your promised, for a huge tax break. Looks like you serve corporations over people still.
You Won. Ignore the Liberal News Media ! do not waste your Political Capital on them !
shake up these ex-patriot companies to come back home. We want them back. Good job, Pres. Elect Mr. Trump!

Ask him how come 1,400 + more jobs are still leaving for Mexico, from Carrier?! Gone by the end of the year 2017.
Dear Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump please help #saveSomersetKyGE. Thank you 

@generalelectric @foxnews @cnn
@abc @nbcnews @cbsnews
Awesome 
A BIG THANK YOU FROM their neighbor in KY !
@TomiCollins Thank you for your good work. I am so happy for those Indiana families.
Love it ...
You can't buy everything needed across the Country with costly incentives. You will actually need to save jobs.
OMG are you going to go on and on every time something like this happens. It's only a few hundred jobs. They'll go broke.
Where is the wall you promised me for my vote?
When will Trump companies start using American workers? I mean the ones with products, the ones that aren't pure cons.
are there any that are not pure cons?
tomorrow's a big day
big jowls too
Sure Don. And how many tax breaks did you promise to give Carrier in order to keep this ridiculous promise you made?
You are mentioned in this article, please review:

United Technologies,who OWNS CARRIER, is a leading defense contractor, who doesn't want to lose BILLIONS the gov gives them
for your Thank You Tour!!
Good job almighty POTUS elect! Your hometown crony Pence did your work and saved half the jobs you promised. Not impressed!
Awesome job by you & VP Elect Pence! PLEASE NO ROMNEY! PLEASE! CAN'T BE TRUSTED! & NO LOYALTY. GO RUDY!!!
Immigrants&american welfare recipients have more benefits than hardworking Americans who want to better themselves.
Great job!
when are you bringing your companies back to the US?!

Stop talking like you actually support jobs or helping the middle class! BS! Your cabinet is full of billionaires!
That's a 1000 more jobs than Obama managed to save in 8yrs of Office #MAGA
great- what incentives did you give Carrier?
Layoffs set to begin next month at Carrier plant #Trump "saved": report #TrumpLeaks #FuckTrump http://hill.cm/jqVcGZH 
great Carrier meeting! save our IT white collar jobs that are going overseas in mass, decimating middle class base
Ready to do this for every company? What are you offering and who is paying for it. Being president is not making deals.
Well done
BTW they make furnaces not air conditioners.
you are a man of your word!
too bad you bought them off for mote than those workers will make in 25 years.  Fraud.
if Obama would have done that wow the GOP would have lost it. But it's ok now that it's a 1 party system.
Remember when Obama said this about you and your thoughts on Carrier?  50 more days... #MAGA  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UGVfv-4Kc …
Check keeping  Carrier  off  your  list
how bout you keep your promise to leave social security and Medicare alone
Yay!! Check that off as a positive move to #MAGA
Please do not choose Mitt Romney
@AnnCoulter Finally  a President who works for the American people.
Part two of that deal is about federal contracts possibly promise to company that owns Carrie you should release details
#notmypresident
Great Job, your not even President yet, and already making
Deals to help workers.
President Trump has not even get to the office yet but is already working to improve the America
How much tax payer money to you give them?
...already keeping your promises (and working hard for the people to be in job/money and bread). Chappeau !
need great buildings and walls on the border? GFRC!!!
Here are the 5 HUGE reasons Clinton lost to Trump: https://goo.gl/2TXfPE 
you're losing me on your appointees. Are you true to your word?
"waving that magic wand! #magicwand

nice bribe you gave them or was it a strong arm move, thx for burdening tax payers for you idea , bigly loss for us
@TrumpPenceUSA1 Who's the Man.President DONALD TRUMP.  Merry Christmas from Indiana.
You had to buy them, you could have opened a new company to replace them!  Had the man power
please help the elderly people that just living off their Social Security checks they need a tax break themselves
interesting
it's recount the vote day on Thursday in WI. 
How about you announce the terms of the deal and what convinced them? What did you pay to keep 1000 defense jobs in the US?
@SlidinDelta I hope Carrier and their people have a Merry Christmas! #CCOT #CarrierStays #MadeInUSA
Taxpayers thank you for adding to our burden.  Of course not yours, because you haven't paid taxes.
what about the other 1,000 workers and what is carrier getting in return for keeping the workers and how long are staying??

Another con, Don.  The 1,000 jobs were always going to stay.  You don't talk about the 1,300 Carrier  jobs headed to Mexico
tu ano tu culo
what sort of concessions did the great state of Indiana need to provide in blackmail...er compromise...
Great job. Might also bring back the draft. Straighten out some of these college cry babies
thank u 4 really working (even before in office) on behalf of Americans harder then any other pres & keeping promises #MaGa
thank you carrier
ignore the haters, they're pissed because you saved jobs and now they can't go on welfare! Productive people thank you!
You are right! You do the right things!I like you style!You become preside of U.S.A Maybe move from Canada
Good job President Trump. One of these days the loony left will figure out you mean well for all U.S. Citizens!
WHO TALKS LIKE THIS?  "GREAT WORKERS OF THAT WONDERFUL STATE"...THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LOOONG, DARE I SAY, FOUR YEARS
parent company united technologies=government contracts!  Slick one donald!
How many jobs? How much taxpayer money? How many chins?
how much tax payer money did you spend to keep 800 jobs?  7 million? Yet their still exporting 1300 jobs!GoodJob   
it will be better
Where's the 35% tax on Carrier like you said you would do ? Why are Taxpayers paying $700k for this ?
way to go! MAGA!
your puppet Pence pulled the wool over Indianas tax payers eyes. #hypocrite
maybe you can start making trump branded items in US. How about that?   Start supporting your own damn country's workers
