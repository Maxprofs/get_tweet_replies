As a NYC high school student, you spoke at our science fair and I remember feeling inspired. I am deeply ashamed of that now.
DeVos is a bad hire. She'd make it harder for disabled children to access education, she defended bringing guns into schools.
Most troubling, she did not understand "Proficiency" vs. "Growth" when questioned by Sen. Franken. Disqualifying incompetence.
That a billionaire can make donations and receive a government appointment beyond her depths is a clear travesty.
You need to look to your party! What was the message? I'm not Trump! It's my turn!

That's it! Nada, zip, nil!
yer darn tootin'! Trump's gonna make pay to play yuge! In '17, we're gonna long for a boring email scandal!
Trump will enforce our laws on your corruptocrats. Many will flee the country. It's coming.
yes! I can't wait for all Americans who disagree with Trump to flee the country, sounds awesome! #MAGA #wearefucked #trumpenfuhrer
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos 

AND she only charges $1 per year!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos I hope so!
every choice for govt positions under Trump is the opposite of what should be qualifications.
.@MoskowitzEva @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Only if you want an education based on a fairy tale. God will FYUp.
Looking for free college? Hah! Pretty soon you will be paying for elementary school.
That's going to leave out about 90% of American children.
What?
Sure beats gov control over every thing!
Of course you thought this .. you're in bed with her ... Run "charter" schools .. 
@MariaBartiromo @BetsyDeVos  DeVos is awesome!!! We need more people like her!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos No, she doesn't you liar. She couldn't even answer a simple question posed by a comedian.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos With no paperwork?  Shameful, but not unexpected with Dimwitted Donnie and his swampy friends
According to financial disclosures, Betsy DeVos and her husband owned shares in K12 Inc., a company whose core
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Make sure she keeps religion out of government funding of private education!! Evil!! #TrumpLies
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She is unqualified to be in charge of education.
Nope; she is the only Trump Choice i entirely disagree with; way too smug; smug never serves the people; only self
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She knows NOTHING about public schools.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos it would be nice if she actually knew anything
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos also has a billion dollars and makes her just another one of your swamp monsters
business model is the management of public for-profit online charter schools.
Coming from a woman who defended the berating of a 5-year-old in one of her schools. Success Academy, right?
Criticism for Trump is not love for Clinton, but I wouldn't expect any "least common denominators" to understand that
Lowest. Common. Denominator.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos You left off "..to rich white kids!"
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos she will  propel America’s public education system toward destruction
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos 
YES, CAN'T WAIT
If she can revitalize them, why does she want to destroy them? Repair is better than repeal.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos definitely need to work to improve the intellect of trumps supporters.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos How's she gonna save public schools if she wants to cut public funding for them?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Gonna be kinda hard when public money goes to private schools via vouchers.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos I'm sure all her education experience will come in handy ... oh wait she has NONE
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos





Appalling-these cult fucked up people have a suicide mission like Jim Jones &A. Hitler.
Stunning: Maggie Hassan (who has a disabled son) realizes that DeVos doesn't know the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act exists. 
.@MoskowitzEva will directly benefit from Betsy's appointment. It's not what's best for all kids. Betsy's plan is only good for certain kids
yeah kids that don't have wealthy parents will benefit. Sorry that it offends you


Why do Democrats REALLY want to tarnish @BetsyDeVos? Wait until you hear! #ConfirmationHearings... http://fb.me/8yDshrLDJ

@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She's  a  trump pick, that in itself should tell you something.
In your delusional fantasy world maybe. @MoskowitzEva @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos
I have children in public school. This woman  never put hers in. WTF does she know about teaching my kids?!
The ONLY things she has is a fucked up religious view and money. She has NO right to screw up our kids lives.
Did Trump pay you to say that?
@SheriffClarke @BetsyDeVos absolutely
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos (1/2) No experience in the management and administration of public schools whatsoever! #MAGA?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos i don't agree w/all your picks Donald, but Betsy deserve a chance because our schools are fucked.
she had her hand in the Detroit Public Schools. No. No more chances.
Detroit what a mess public schools failed all of the kids there
@realDonaldTrump Betsy wants to defund public education school to send kids to religious schools. First amendment?
No
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos. You must be unemployed
you'd really sell out our children by supporting this clown? I've lost all respect for you.
The person who has gone to only private schools & has give huge money to charter schools will NEVER be good for PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Yeah, remember that time you said almost exact same thing about now-disgraced Cathie Black in NYC?
Are you intimating these two are in it for themselves? Because that's...unfortunately true. 

@MrBlifil @MoskowitzEva @BetsyDeVos
She has $$, not talent...That's all it takes -> donations + wealth = qualified for Trump.

@JordanJamie @MrBlifil @MoskowitzEva @BetsyDeVos
. Plus shes a religious nut, thinks teachers r overpaid & has no love fr pub.schools
Love Religious Nuts!!
What we need!
So. you're OK with tax dollars going to a Muslim school?
Islam is not a #Religion, it's a #Cult
.@MoskowitzEva there is huge money to be made here, which has everyone salivating. Don't let people tell you they "do it for the kids" pt1
This is so very true. Sad part about is that the people who voted for him are not getting any of it 
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos I WON
Yes Trump did win apparently sleeping Putin paid off. Hope he had a cigarette after
In the post-truth Trumpian world, "public school" means "for profit private educational corporation."
The return investment in education is what the next generation brings...
You don't get a career for high school.
That is false. School is supposed to educate a new generation on society.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos And the money and the money and the money
go fuck gravel
When did you start such a nasty habit.  Did you start with small animals then work your way to rocks?
.@MoskowitzEva @BetsyDeVos She also has a devastating track record of failing schools & 0 experience in education. #TrumpLies #TheResistance
amazing contradiction. No experience yet has ruined schools. Hmmmmmm.
Yes, she has run schools, while knowing nothing about educaton.
admit If trump appointed Einstein you'd have a problem that he couldn't tie his shoes
I like some of his appointents, such as Mattis. So you'd be wrong.
just like doctors don't need to run healthcare
No apparently they need to run HUD.
apparently since he refused the healthcare job
@lgmaterna @BetsyDeVos the libs are causing her probs at every turn ,ridiculous, we are proud to have you Betsy MAGA 
@realDoaldThump @BetsyDeVos  what?!"  Can someone be so out of reality about hurting their mandate?
when exactly is she going to start showing it then?
...," said no one, ever.
weird coming from you. also tell betsy to pay her fine.
Yeah, she has a pretty hefty one to take care of before Friday... They are all frauds.
#HillaryLost
#whatever
#Liberal #Agenda #Dead #Failure
She certainly has the commitment to abolish public schools! https://medium.com/@tawny/trump-loves-information-iliteracy-fed367644f79#.bdgwwdni8 … #BetsyDeVos
Because, as Hitler said, stupid people are easy to control.
Trump Loves The Poorly Educated!
But just because they are uneducated does not mean they do not have common sense
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos are you mentally impaired?
You're not from Michigan, are you?
Decrease your dosage.  You're delusional.
@MoskowitzEva ... please send the GPS coordinates of your phucking alternate universe....it must be amazing there!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos hahahahahahahahahaha
opportunity? lets just start with real world education. STEM, arts, language skills, all needed for future oppty
Eva probably got a hemorrhoid pulling THAT one out of her *ss. #241ondingbats
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos NOT

This is the biggest, fattest bullshit I've ever read.
Nope.
WAT?
https://twitter.com/MoskowitzEva/status/821403806370058240 …
Devos is a Christian loon. She has no experience with public schools and frankly is unfit for her job.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos what have you've been smoking u crooks.
You're shameful.
did @BetsyDeVos promise you a job? Embarrassing to watch her responses. She clearly knows nothing about education at any level
You know she did.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos
you are sick you need to have psychological tests
Have your seen her supreme court hearings? She doesn't have the talent to answer a question.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She has the talent of a rich white privileged woman who cares nothing about the ppl.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Clearly she does not. We see what you are up to. We will resist you.
Hilarious. You're counting on people NOT watching her crash and burn performance yesterday. SAD.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos I don't think so
This lady has NO experience for the cabinet position & caters to "for profit" charter schools, NOT public schools.
When pigs fly! She's the worst choice for the job.  Didn't even know what the Disabilities act was regarding education.
This is going onto your permanent record.
Betsy DeVos is a luney FUNDAMENTALIST.  She has NO background for this at all but money.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos she is elitist never went to pub school and her children didn't either.
Besty DeVos's plans are to pillage one system to fund another.
Based on WHAT?! Not the #DeVosHearing #IDEA and knowledge of fed mandates matters
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos 
#ICallBullshit
You're outta your mind. Never speak again
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos No experience,  no qualifications,  expecting "return on her investment."  BETSY, YOU'RE FIRED.
This woman wouldn't make it past the first round of a teacher interview! Do better! #notdevos
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos "POTENTIAL GRIZZLIES". Are you kidding me?
Are you high? Which hearing were you watching?????
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos and to have guns in schools to shoot grizzlies -IDIOTIC!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos are they paying you to say this?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos I watched the hearing and failed to see PROFICIENCY in any of her answers.
No she doesn't. She has no clue what the hell she will be doing.
Let's turn everything over to private industry what could go wrong w that idea? #corporatism #greed #Rethuglicans
don't think so. Devos has serious issues with Federal Law...
@SheriffClarke @BetsyDeVos need laws keeping teachers political views out of schools ( they are twisting young mind)
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos must be why MI charter schools are utter failures
You're joking right? Any day now, you're going to unveil your real cabinet picks... right?
@realDonaldTrump This choice is one that even I am having a hard time backing, President Trump. Please reconsider.
the way she and Sen Price have been treated in hearings is downright slimy.
Not surprised you would say this Ms. Moskowitz, however, Ms. DeVos appears to lack knowledge basic things.
Ha.No background in public education.Privatizing doesn't help those MOST in need.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos -she couldn't answer basic ?s -her slip was showing -awful
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Just zero experience lol 
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos - are you kidding me !!!!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She's going to create another pyramid scheme like her dad.
is horrible choice. Money talks. #education
Absolutely not. How many years has she taught? Where did she get her education degree?
Well she successfully hid ALL those qualities at her hearing
wrong.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Are you nuts?? She is not prepared for this job!!!
You spelled "dismantle" wrong.
Leadership capacity? This isn't a tryout. She's an idiot with no experience.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She isn't familiar with IDEA & won't commit to forcing ALL schools who get fed funds to comply.
she HSS no experience what so ever, she's there because of her money that's it.  BAD, BAD CHOICE
One question handguns in a hill to defend against GRIZZLY BEARS WTF?!?!?
Yes!  She, so well, withstood the NONSENSE of Patty Murray and Fauxahontas Warren.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She has a vested business interest in creating student debt Conflict of interest much? #notmydebt
The same Betsy DeVos who has spent her life campaigning against public education?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos No. No she does not.
And a lifetime of being on the payroll of the Republican party. I guess that's what does it..?
@petitchatadore This is a joke....right ????
And how big was your check?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos 1 owns charter schools endorses 1 who wants to privatize public schools? No conflict there huh?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Shame- she won't support protection for disabled students. I heard her say.  Terrible nominee.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos wrong!
.@MoskowitzEva @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos you forgot the most important, experience smh...
Experienced or not most in govt HAVE experience and it has done NOTHING for America.
and could have answered those questions better than she did, especially the one about growth.
@realDonaldTrump Did you watch any of her confirmation hearing? She is NOT qualified. #potentialgrizzlies
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Also she can save the US from grizzly bears.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos I just lost my lunch.
Or the more likely scenario of our schools continuing to slide into the abyss.
Ha! Did you actually watch her hearing? As an educator she seemed as ill prepared as students who didn't study!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos We are praying for you. You have big job but have a HUGE opportunity...
ha, what experience does she even have in education?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos ...if you don't mind that she is horribly uninformed. Will reflect poorly on administration.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos So basically your schools need money?
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos and if you believe that, you'll be the nxt to be attacked by the grizzlies.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Let's call it what it really is: the plunder of public schools to line oligarchs' pockets.
@realDonaldTrump  Betsy DeVos does not understand education. She couldn't answer questions at the hearing. NOT fit to lead!
Seriously?She not only doesn't know the difference between proficiency and growth.She also hates public schools.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos due to extreme overpopulation, and the small schools that exist ...
Our troubled schools don't have time to wait for Betsy DeVos to educate herself! ......
@realDonaldTrump  @BetsyDeVos Did you write this on Opposite Day?
- Can I have some of what you've been smoking?
Two capitalist vampires feeding on the public school system, extorting teachers & making profits. Don't trust em.
Yet she cannot expound on topics such as proficiency, accessibility, and safety. Most concerning.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos yes you would say this since you clearly have a financial interest in her potential policies.
looks like she has the #heart to #care #serve & make a glorious difference for kids and parents
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos No she doesn't. Not even close
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos her lack of basic understanding of the position is frightening..this is not about school vouchers
yeah,people with 0 experience in a classroom who have never taken a college education course are super qualified
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos This lady isn't any more qualified to head DoE, than I am to be a brain surgeon.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos our schools need it. President Trump and his team are a  breath of fresh air
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Guns because of grizzly bears? She is utterly unqualified & paid 200 million for this job.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos are you joking? She's easily the MOST UNQUALIFIED
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos shouldn't you have SOME type of training in education? I mean for goodness sake.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos @FaceTheNation Yet you never mentioned the education to do it. She have Growth or Proficiency?
wrong, she's a know-nothing reactionary
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos you have no clue and neither does she. Proof on video
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos yet doesn't understand what "growth" is as far as education goes. #TheBasics
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos absolutely zero experience. djtRUMP only looking for scapegoats for failure.
.@MoskowitzEva @BetsyDeVos Did you watch even 10 minutes of the confirmation hearing?! "I look forward to working with you on this."
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos LOL. That's so funny you say this since the OPPOSITE is true. DeVos is unqualified and uninformed
She didn't even know about growth vs. proficiency! She is an insult to education. #MAdumbA
and this is a lie.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos She has NO idea what goes on in public school. AND she didn't even do any research to get a clue
Another dummy does not know what she's talking about she looked ridiculous at her hearring!
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos this is the biggest slap in the face to every educator. #ByeBetsy #EducatorsAgainstDeVos
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos Didn't know I had to be afraid of Grizzlies in public schools.
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos yeah. And pigs can fly.  She is pathetic. Felt sorry for her she looked so stupid.
"capacity" is meaningless—public education experience and equal focus on every single child are what count.
bitch where
Betsy DeVos has zero public school experience. She was a disaster in her own state.
yet she has no clue as to what IDEA is!?
Just watch out for grizzlies!
She has failed every model she has tried.Paying for public school plus taxes is a good idea? School is for profit?
by draining $$$ from public education & giving it to for-profit corps without accountability.SAD!
I must have watched a different hearing
clearly she's a little..ya know...UNSURE..like everyone else who lies.
Have Devos tell Elizabeth Warren to hop on her broom!  Warren is a real LIBERAL LUNATIC!
profiteer of education - that's what you and @BetsyDeVos are
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos 
Eva, are you on drugs or just that clueless? Your education failed you. DeVos won't fix that.
