American People are watching you Senate Committee on vote  of Tax Cuts and Tax Reform !    Your Vote better be “YES”!

Only you can get it done.
DC better start getting agendas passed and taking care of the American people
No still unfair too senior citizens and Many more.
Last thing we need is more tax cuts for the rich.  All u r trying to do is help yourself and ur friends. U don't care about the middle class
We need a president who is fair, manufactures his products in America, and hires Americans.
We also need a president that is not a dotard.
Resign, orangutang.
100% correct Mr President! Thank you for fighting for the citizens of our great nation. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #DrainTheSwamp #MASA #BuildTheWall

Dear mr trump engage in et alien disclosure for humanity and the galactics
Give it a rest.  You’re becoming irrelevant.
Yes we do. Why then are you taking away my homeowner's and child deduction?
MAGA!!!
Yes, we need a tax system where businesses and the wealthy pay their fair share. You thief. #TaxFraud
Then do not give the ultra rich a massive tax cut. Remember you saud they would not get one? Liar
It's going to be a tremendous plan, folks. Believe me. It won't help me & my rich friends. I promise!!

Trump didnt create the tax laws your congressmen did. Term limits
To quote @RepJoeWilson , "You lie".
He’s saying the right things
And we need you maintain & lead the charge against the RepubliCANTS who sabotage our agenda! #MAGA. @realDonaldTrump 

Trump Supporters when they can’t bring up Eminem as a defense that white people can rap
And the current proposal doesn't do it!
So then basically the opposite of what you are proposing?..
We do need a tax plan that will help working class Americans, and it's not Trump's. The #TrumpTaxPlan is a #TrumpTaxScam!
No longer should tax cuts for the wealthy be balanced on the backs of working class Americans.
One in six Americans (including millions of children) are going hungry and Trump wants a tax break for himself and his aristocratic buddies.
Then why is your shit all made in China you loser?
Hai when u look from the sky...hiji there are NO BOUNDERIES. I jusust telle u. U have vape Csnabatsl... but nice try mr. PRESIDENTU MAKES THE WORLD A BETTER PLACRI LIKE THR FLOWER NARCISt
Better get some Democrats  to help you. Those fat cats are not getting it done
That why you had my vote and all Trump’s will have my vote.
We the American people need this tax reform badly to help Make America Great Again!!! 
Why do so many people insist it will not help working families, but only the wealthy?
Because of #FakeNews

Anyone who looks at the proposal can clearly see this benefits everyone.
In what ways will it help everyone?
Double the standard deductions, 3 brackets, thresholds raised, child credits higher. Look at the damn proposal. Then ask me,stop being lazy!
No more federal deduction for local taxes.. hurts many middle class home owners.
WE NEED A TAX CUT...CONGRESS!!!
funny where are all you naysayers on this tweet? Why dont you Jr swamp creatures get a life

So you better get some Democrats  to help you. Your facets are not getting it done
If that's true, you should have a tax plan that actually helps them directly.   But you don't because you don't truly care.  You just lie.

Your mouth says nice things but your actions tell a different story. Your #TAXCUTFORTHERICH will cost middle class Americans Thousands $$$

If you want a fair tax system, how about you and your friends actually pay your share.
If democrats ever put their money where their mouths are there wouldn't be any rich democrats.
Where ARE ALL your companies TRUMP. 
There not here in the Great USA. Bull shit trump.

Just check out some of things Dems have done and take lessons. Afterall, you praised them for decades
we do!  So throw your plan in the trash and write one that actually will do that
Let's talk about FAIR.  IRC section 86 in 1983 was intended to tax SS bens for 10%.  Today, 70% are taxed.  Retirees are paying MORE.  Help!
Well you need to hurry it up because im tired of being broke and struggling in Mississippi 
Hard to believe your tax plan has  NOOOOO incentives for the wealthy.
So why do you want to just lower taxes for yourself and burden Middle incomes with more tax?!?!? Fancy another bankruptcy? This time the USA
Then stop trying to give money to the rich by stealing from the poor. You're the most disgusting thing to ever have been born!
Yes, so TAX the rich. Don't cut their taxes. And stop letting them hide their money offshore. OH, wait...that would affect you too
Hmmm @realDonaldTrump that sounds great! But I don't believe a word you say until it's set in stone and written down. #Justlikeapolitician
This aint it!
YOU FIRST! Lead by example or shut your hole. You and your daughter both. Or is that just "smart business?"
We need a president, not a moron. You’re making George W look like a genius! #bravo
we tried that already. it didn't work. but we know you don't really care about american working families, only your rich friends.
And Donald Trump wants a giant tax cut for himself.
When you put such a plan forward I will support. Until then FORRGEITABOUTDIT!
You are and this is a #TaxFraud
Your absolutely right!!!!!
how exactly are you helping the middleclass? divorced own a home 2 grown children at home after college and i pay highest in income tax
Then push for the @FairTaxOfficial it is the only way to get rid of the IRS
. The wall is good, but having an efficient visa entry/exit system is vital also  About 40% of illegals are visa overstays.
What a hypocrite!  You, that request foreign workers for your hotels.
You don’t seem to be doing any of that
Lowering Corp.Taxes doesn't do anything to wages.
You're cut is expected to add 2.2 trillion to the debt. The rise of the SM started in 2009
Oh and you are a Moron

Mr President, we love your vision of and for America. God bless you. MAGA
And we need a President who represents all of America not just the ones he likes or are nice to him   psycho in the White House!
Good luck in NYS we don’t stand a chance.
LLPoF!!!

@POTUS

No more carried int in private equity, hedge funds & finance.
Raise rate for Gates & Buffet to 45%
to bad you have no clue how to achieve this miracle
Thank u!!
สัญญาณเน็ตทำงานหายไปค่ะ
Just another one of your FUCKING lies, we’ll see the truth soon enough....

Any justifications for dismissing the $1.5 trillion cost of the GOP tax reform plan defy both evidence and logic: http://bit.ly/2fv1fJm  
We need #FAIRtax
And puts $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ in your pocket. Screw the workers as long as you get money
Bull. You are just spreading the dough out to yourself and your well of confederates. The average American will not benefit, just more debt.

So is all your business here in the states then
And your tax plan is not going to do that.  Your tax plan is about making the rich richer and the  poor poorer.
Perfect!
Yeah
YEAH - LEAD BY EXAMPLE- BRING YOUR BUSINESSES BACK TO THE USA
We subsidize companies way to much now. They hold us hostage for tax breaks, provide low wages, cut benefits, steal pensions.
Looks like all of the companies here in Canada are on their way to the USA!  sigh....I wish we had Trump for Prime Minister.
You can have him.
You won't know what you've missed til he's gone.
ANEN
Yes we do and leave Social Security alone while your at it we tax payers pay into we should be able to collect when we retire
Agreed coward Trump, we need to tax the wealthy at a much higher rate yo put the money back in the hands of WORKING people.
Where are all of your companies now?
These I'd like to see happen before you leave office!
pro tax reform..based on what I hear,I would pay more in taxes under this plan..I am middle class,single,own home..dont take deductions away
Tell Them Boss Man . 
Let the next president handle it.  Your comprehension of the problem is childish at best.
Not your tax framework for sure with bulk of tax cut benefits going to rich and corporations!
A lot of working families need that estate tax reform?
For just a few million dollars a day, we can make sure little Ivanka gets the legal help she desperately needs.
Think how much more money working families will get when we cap pass through income at 15%

Here is the Executive Order to undermine the ACA.

Long on propoganda. Short on details. Plenty of sabotage. 2/ 
awesome idea....
LOL, that's NOT what you want. You STRIVE each day to demolish the middle class and poor. The WORLD wants to move away from YOU TRAITOR.
Then why does your tax plan make foreign earned income tax free? Seems fishy
Its nit my tax plan. Nothing you can do about it. How we go from football to tax plans?
We didn't. I was replying to Trump
We need a president who doesn’t hate America. And while we’re at it, brains would be nice.
except if it is you. Then you can hire from where ever and not pay American workers. #americahatesyou
You know nothing about working families.
I agree with you Donald, why don't you tell @IvankaTrump that? All products she sells are made in other countries. Hypocrite! @CNN @FoxNews

My new video is yuuuge. Belieb me. #DesperateCheeto  
Says the #MoronInChief. King of outsourcing and tax breaks for the rich. #presidentmoron #NotMyPresident #YoureTheWorst
RESIST TRUMP AND GOP AGENDA! Their motto: Rich get richer, everyone else is collateral damage!
Travel around the world and you will hear something about a little guy called Donald. but love?
GO GET A JOB YOU CRYING LIBERAL  . NOTHING IS FOR FREE
Still supporting the President I voted for!  No one was in my booth but me. :)
Yup, so instead you are working at reducing your own taxes, and doing nothing for most Americans?
Right now we have no idea if GOP plan is FAIR because the full plan isn't released. Why? What are you afraid of? #LetUsSeeTheFullPlan
How about eliminate taxes altogether?
ES MUY BUENA DESICION
10% of earnings straight across.
Most senior citizens only have real estate tax write-off - please don't eliminate; give it a cap if you have to, but don't eliminate.
So far you have not come up with one.
We@need a President to represent and govern us. When will we get one of those again?
Yet more tinkle down economic swill from the chief boar at the trough.
Keep making America Great Mr President. We Pray for you and your beautiful God loving Family.
Good. So first you quit, and take all those tax money sucking pigs in your cabinet with you. #25thAmendmentNow
up
Correct. We need a tax system that does not punish the the middle class in favor of the wealthy.
Too bad that's not what you presented Congress.
No reform until we see your returns. You nasty kakistrocratic!!
Your millionaire friends said "we don't want anything" from your tax plan?

Probably true, they want EVERYTHING!

No estate tax helps who?
I agree
Seniors need help Mr;President; we have paid taxes for 50+ years;It is time to clear us of tax; us who are unemployed.
Yes we do. Thanks for your leadership.
Just bring America back. I feel like I am visiting a foreign country and it feels pretty bleak.
This is just what this country needs. It's been a long t
It's been a long time coming for the middle class. The Donald is a hero!
.Says the man who hires imported workers, built with Chinese steel and whose family makes their crap overseas
I love it when you take your case for tax reform directly to the people! We need your voice to be heard to get change 
Make it 11% across the board period,and dissolve irs!
[ #realdonaldtrump ]
FAKE ELECTION FAKE PRESIDENT
You wouldn't know anything about that.
Your tax plan isn't going to help working families! #LyingSackOfShit #FuckingMoron
So your family will now be using American companies to create your cheesy clothing lines?
Reagan and George W tried to sell us the same crap. Trickle down does not work!
And you need to move you your Eastern European wife and entire family out of USA. Take Conway with you. You will still need serviced I ASSume.
Encourage foreign college graduates to stay in America. Middle class doesn't live paycheck to paycheck, low income does and spends it
Lisa Simpson OUR PRESIDENT !!!)))
I agree but when are all departments in our government going to be audited?  I am with you no matter your decision.  MAGA
What about the self-employed people that work out of their home? Are you going to give us a tax break?
Agreed.  Let us know when you propose one. @realDonaldTrump @realtaxreform
So cutting taxes for the top 5% wealthiest in our country, cutting corporate taxes by 50% and doing zero for middle & lower classes works?
Stop the lies about the tax system then and show us yours
Yes - if only there was an admin that could deliver - not scraps to the masses and massive cuts for rich - 45 and gutless @gop fail
Repeal WELFARE/16thAMEND! IMMIGRATION will stop, legal-citizens will work 2 MAGA/provide 4 their families! I work you eat=SOCIALISM/SLAVERY!
of the American citizens of Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Croix and St John. Your a poor example of a President.
@cashmoneykid77 Dont tax a mans labor, that is slavery. Tax profits on investments and commerce!
