Keep going PRESIDENT TRUMP.....AMERICA loves you....and, apparently, the world!!!!!!
I would just like to spend a day with you.
How about your comps@realDonaldTrump
can you help me get child support for the first time in 8 years from my kids dad who owns a thriving business?
right rule 

Left rule hhhhhhh
Your rules aren't "simple", Mr. TinyHands; they're simple-*minded*. Which is exactly what I expect from you.
So what about GM cars manufactured in Mexico; American or not? Nissans manufactured in the US; American, or not?
You say this with a picture of you wearing a hat made in China. Hypocrite.
Your are the greatest.  .Keep it going, our country is praying for you and your family.
happy saint Patrick day what do you think of us Irishman?
then why is all your crap and all your daughter's creation made in China? #impeachtheliar
You give tremendous amts of money to CA? It's the other way around dufus, CA  has the 6th largest economy in the world.
yes he is F'n America with no Vaseline right now
Thank you Mr. Trump. When will you and Ivanka bring all of your manufacturing back to the USA?
You don't do either in your businesses.
Is your hand really far away in that photo?
Urgh, make a personal account if you want to indulge in such drivel. To the detriment of the brand.
The brand will survive, but thanks for the concern.
I didn't say otherwise. Point stands. Most unbecoming of this account.
ok, sorry dad
that is fing awesomeness!!!!
Is it too late in a pregnancy to abort a 70 year old?
This

A shame "Do no evil"  isn't one of them.
Yes, but will your companies follow suit? We'll see.
AMERICANS FIRST!!! USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA!!!!!
THAT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE THOSE WHO TRUST YOU TO COME THRU FOR THEM WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.
two simple rules. 1) ignore fact, logic and science 2) generally be a dick. I think we have a good handle on what's coming.

What good heh
What’s really sad is those trusting you to help them will find out they’ve been played for suckers. And you’ll be laughing.
a socialist just lecturing us on being a sucker. Lol
.@realDonaldTrump You just hired a bunch of foreign workers & your & Ivanka's products are made offshore. No rules for Trumps?
les quelles precisement.
More rules. 1. Pay taxes 2. Resolve #conflictsofinterest 3. Stop #pussygrabbing
let's start with u and Daughter
yes the first & last rule do it & do it now, no excuses !!
please don't forget, some of your fellow Americans work overseas and are not ready to come home yet, Dad.
none of that @IvankaTrump shit then?
We want decent people to come, not these gang members that are killing Americans daily with their poisoned Heroin.
Take a look at this form for job history in California. As an American I need to pay $136 to SSA but foreigners don't 
unbelievable that as an American I need to pay $136 to SSA but foreigners don't + plus SSA form does not prove Hours worked
You have already broken that rule as all of your merch is made out of this country.
so this is one of those 'do as I say not as I do' things ...
sb
.@realDonaldTrump oh, "buy American and hire American." Few of your companies, or your cabinet members, even do that. But your admin will?
@seanspicer @scottienhughes @GOP thrump is a lieing con artist #crookeddonald
great thinking posting your official policies to social media. All of your rube followers will love it.
It is your DUTY  to SUPPORT .@realDonaldTrump 2 Simple Rules....Buy American Hire American!  START NOW!!! BOYCOTT TRUMP BRANDS!
the Starman to the Princess: "Let's shag ass; the earthlings have elected an orange man child as a world leader."

ass to class



buy Russian BS and peddle Russian BS.
start with your own companies.
Why do I get the feeling the word "hypocrite" is going to be used a great deal in the next four years.
Don @realDonaldTrump 

 "The Kremlin also has both video & audio recordings of Trump in a kompromat file." 

Yep, Putin can turn on a dime
so we wait til 1/21 to start boycotting your products??  (Just trying to get this all straight).  Or should we start now?
I'd like to see his new TV show get canceled.
If you mean The Apprentice that he insists on producing...no way I watch that drivel.  No way
All that about being a producer of The Apprentice, that's #FakeNews.
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/807547249681166336 …  BIG STAKE
I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!
.@realDonaldTrump Great slogan, sweetie! Nobody sells like my Donny! but being the architect of viable policy should be a bit more nuanced.
.@realDonaldTrump I just hope you figure out the nuts and bolts of it before you have to sit down and President.

Instagram announcements! Wow! Is he mentally 13?
I'd say more like 10.
Now I have to ask my kid to help me set up an Instagram so I can see PEOTUS posts
Just another bizarre thing in this demonic administration.
maybe they take his phone away once he is sworn in. They give him a "presidenty" one
Charlie Sheen doesn't endorse or like Trump.
Donald whining about President Obama is hilarious given that Trump for years led the racist birther crusade.
 @realDonaldTrump
it wasn't racist to question his citizenship.  Trump in 1 month has done more for USA than Obama in 8 yrs.
I'm a retired Army Ranger & patriot with a degree in finance. I'm willing to bet your a coward
Trump will prove to be one of the greatest presidents we have had. He will fight for the people of USA
socialism sucks ass, promotes laziness, kills creativity & empowers leaders with self serving God complex
.@realDonaldTrump You have frequently hired foreign guest workers to fill jobs that could be completed by Americans
why aren't you in jail?
No "I plead the 5th" multiple times scumbag!
I'm suprised your even literate.
I really doubt you know how to follow rules.  But ok..start by making your cheap ties here
what cheap shot?  Calling greed for what it is?
@jrsicon2 @realDonaldTrump no chance for Trump he's illegitimate! Needed assist from Putin Assange Comey your "new king" fails
how come you won't release your taxes?
@Chelstastico @realDonaldTrump because he's a loser and a liar
I would just love to see what he has to hide.
yeah me to you know he's hiding something
just like Obama's college records.
no, no no, it's Trump's swamp now.
he had 8 years to release. What's he hiding?
what does that have to do with Donald's tax returns
1. Cut taxes for rich. 2. Cut services to poor.
I immediately regret the six dozen ten-month-long arguments that will now be waged without me in my mentions.

If u have children I feel sorry for them.
i dont feel 1 bit sorry that we got our country back, for us.. for our children..
I was referring to how u act. Yes we all want a great country
u apparently dont, you'd rather have treasonous felon hillary...
Please, I don't want fight with you. I wish all of u Happy New Years. Hope for a good year
which ppl?  The white males?
trump cares about trump period. He conned a bunch of rednecks into thinking he cared for votes and he'll bury them
You dropped some receipts. @realDonaldTrump
中国制造 very nice!
(1) do what Russia says, and (2) do what Israel says
1. Russia is awful and shouldn't be a partisan issue. 2. The antisemitism surrounding Israel forces support.
(2) sure but being indirectly critical of settlement building's effects on a two state solution is doctrine.
there is nuance to this. There are few best friends. The trump team can't grasp that.
I agree but also think we should error on the side of previous attempts of genocide. This isn't a level field.
I think Palestinian government television encouraging the public to stab Jews should stop before 2-state.
ok, but it's been the policy of the U.S. for 40 years to support Israel but quietly criticize settlement building
for the Trumpites to now claim failure to veto a toothless resolution is something different is disingenuous.
why don't you start with your own products?
You DO know that the FAR rules for most US govt contracts already stipulate this? Who are you trying to fool?
1. Do whatever #VladimirPutin says. 2. #MakeRussiaGreatAgain

If you really cared you would step down and let someone who knows what there doing, is qualified to be President. u r NOT
Never mind that @realDonaldTrump does not himself adhere to his "hire American, buy American" bullshit as he hired 46 foreign for Mara Lago
how did your 35% days tariff turn into 5% as a last resort?  #Putinspuppet
https://twitter.com/reaIDonaldTrunp/status/816334411222241280 …  have a look at this account sir..such a shame ..they are faking you and people are baffled by it
If by offshore drilling you mean 'let's bang some chicks on a boat' then I'm all for it. Melania likes boats.
Are you sure you can handle 2? You seem pretty stupid.
1. Be self serving. 2. Gift USA to Russia
The rest of the world will also follow 2 rules:  Hire & Buy from the rest of the world #RestOfTheWorld #USA
did Baron make that Instagram picture? He's a wiz with the cyber.

Will your goods and Ivankas goods still be made out of the US because it's cheaper? How is that right? Double standard no?
your two simple rules just don't apply to you!!!
So start making clothes in the USA!! You and the future First Daughter! Your purported "enemies" are watching you.
CORRECTION, THREE: "Lead from the front, & WIN CONSISTENTLY, Blessings to our worldly King
hire me
Your companies sure didn't follow those rules.
make American buy American? Why is that for everyone but you and your daughter she walks on stage with dress from China??
Sounds like more gov't regs to me. I'm A-OK with it, but the GOP may not be. How about start with Trump companies & brands.

but that ball cap was made in China you hypocritical fool
BUY AMERICAN! AND HIRE AMERICAN!!! THAT'S WHY AMERICANS LOVE TRUMP!!!
idiot!
most strongly hope that you no longer purchase China steel to build your majestic hotel!
Says the guy wearing a hat made in China.
That means what for the foreign workers you just hired?  And your foreign-made articles will be made stateside now?????
scary
~@realDonaldTrump Looks like your third rule is "Speak no ill of Vladimir Putin."
@cnn @realDonaldTrump How many Trump branded products are made by Americans?  Could it be none?  The lemmings continue their march to death.
Then, why not, make all your named products in the USA?
https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4578431/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interest-list/%3Fsource%3Ddam?client=safari … If this weren't so tragic, it might be funny? U R fooling no one other than the uneducated U love!
Is your company moving manufacturing from Mexico, China, etc. back to the US?
so how does Vladimir Putin taste, Donald Trump?
drain the swamp before climate change does!
hypocrite

Tiny bent thumbs! SAD!
Yea am with 100%
you suck!!!!
Yep. 1st rule. Make shit up. 2nd rule. Take in the Anus from Putin
You do not practice what you preach here.  Why are so hypercritical here?  You are so still fired.
He says as he wears "Made in China" clothes...
You will never be anything but Putin's lapdog Looser
Carl Icahn, will be a “special adviser” to the drumpf on regulatory issues. The perfect gift. Can u say conflict of intrest
#PutinsPuppet
Happy New Years Donald Trump our new president
Simple being the keyword here. VERYVERYVERYVERYREALLYSIMPLE
why have rules that even you won't follow? Screw the rules, right?
RULE 1) LIE . . . .RULE 2) DENY !
Meanwhile; Trump cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps, mirrors and neckties are made in China
except of course when it comes to your company, where its best to buy elsewhere. #notmypresident
Stop all these stupid 50+ year old wars would be a very good place to start. We all want a peaceful world !
do you promise your companies will #buyamerican and #hireamerican? @NationalNurses @unifylabor @RoseAnnDeMoro @ninaturner

lies lies and more lies
no, your administration will follow a lot of rules. Particularly rules outlined by that ol' Constitution and by SCOTUS
Kiss Putins butt and Screw the people! Right?
If you can remember them.
I really hope so. I also hope Australia will follow. We're DROWNING over here!
they have to be simple for a simple mind
why don't you start with your own crap that you have made elsewhere and try to peddle
hmmm, does this mean you're closing all your companies over seas?
Could this make our bonds stronger ? I do not know ? Yet ...  …https://israelinformationcenterpoliticalblog.wordpress.com/twitter-postings-president-elect-president-donald-trump-national-guard-issue/ …

So you will move the manufactruing of Trump clothing from China to the USA then?

Right, sure. Like anyone should believe that coming from the guy that outsources *everything*? C'mon.
i think your plan is to enslave Anericans so you can make more $  if we are all broke, who will buy anything #putinspuppet
TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR!
will buying 'American' and bringing back our jobs; be equal state-wide and in line with federal laws/guidelines ?
2.9 million votes
When?
#walkthetalk
The only way consumers will buy american goods is if imports are more expensive. Good luck on that.
So turn the coal mining areas into solar panel meccas.  Coal isn't coming back, and you promised them jobs.
so...communism over capitalism...or capitol-communism?
...so that means your products and Ivanka's will now be made in the U.S.?

Make sure you do your job right and serve with integrity . Don't forget you will be working for me
