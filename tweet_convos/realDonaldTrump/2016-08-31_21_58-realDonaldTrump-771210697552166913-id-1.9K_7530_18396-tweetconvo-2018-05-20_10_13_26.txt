@Sapper7575 @CNN #NoDACA #SchumerShutdown
Glad to hear it. They didn't even try to come up with a viable LEGAL option, needs to be ended now
The more I think of it, the more I believe they are pushing AMNESTY instead of a “path to citizenship” because they don’t want to have to review CRIMINAL RECORDS. 
The Mexi-Mob are your local heroin salesmen. Your Sanctuary Cities, are probably their corporate headquarters.
Thank you Mr. President! Stand strong.  @TheDemocrats chose illegals over American citizens, hope everyone sees this.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump 

We hope you remember your statement! We expect you to keep your word!
Awesome!!!!!

You heard it hear before rush says it 3 days from now, George bush sr. ran on lower taxes with his famous "read my lips"... When he raised taxes he was immediately a one term president, trump ran on the wall and no amnesty, if he betrays us then he is done.
Trumps meeting today all he is talking about is getting along w dems even said "maybe we shld bring back earmarks cause they bring both sides together"WHAT.?
He wasnt elected to bring dems together Did obama even try to bring Republicans together? Ithink trump presidency is over.
Need proof?Lyndsay Graham is now saying what a great moment this is what a great potus trump is BYE! Communist dick durbin opened meeting saying " first &foremost dems believe in border security above all else"The old trump would have said " what the hell are you talking about?"
there will be no presidency!
Grow up. Do your parents know you have a Twitter?
Delete your account. (via https://trumpdeleteyouraccount.com )
There will be no amnesty!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou
Don't show your man boobs
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  Remember your campaign promise.  No amnesty, no chain migration, no lottery, no birthright citizenship, no Hb-1, no TPS

Build the wall
Thank you for fighting for us!#IamWithPresidentTrump
Trump is a greedy, self-possessed, despicable, dishonest subhuman being.
And those are his good points!
Yeah, I was being kind
Thank you for embarrassing our nation again today. The emperor has no clothes and a small penis.
you funny guy Obama 57% approval 50 % never vote but good try with your spin
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump STICK TO YOUR PROMISES PLESSE SIR. WE’RE WITH YOU. WE TRUST YOU. #NoAmnesty #BuildTheWall #EndDACA
What a great President
If you're with Trump, RT or like. Each RT is an actual vote. Each like is a thumbs up!
Yes, because quoting what Trump actually said is now considered LYING by Trump sheep.
Hmmm... yeah, you are. Don't worry, I know Hilary isn't much better.
Fact (you'll have to look up the definition) checkers disagree. https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/569e650dc08a801c008ba6dc-919-689/screenshot2016-01-19at11.31.44am.png …
You are dealing with snakes and nothing should be agreed to unless it means the wall gets built FIRST! @realDonaldTrump @Metal_Kitty_X89

#releasethememo
@realdonaldtrump keep your promise to those who put you in the white house !
.@kausmickey enabled Trump 100%, he never demanded Trump keep his promises or gave Trump smart arguments that'd undercut Dems. Kaus (to extent he has any influence) is part of the reason why Trump pushes amnesty.

MT @SandraKayWard3 RT @ArianeDolgah: [Trump, keep your promises!]
Delete your account. (via @trumpdelete)
There will be no amnesty!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou
That worked! He's going to delete it tomorrow. Stupid!
I trust Trump as much as I trust that's your picture.
You lied You are a man with no honor. Your dad is probable rolling his eyes at the way you lied to the people.
Trump on #DACA

August 31, 2016

"Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country."  Keep your promise. USA 1st @SenTedCruz @RandPaul @GOP @VP deport them. No daca @SpeakerRyan
Legal immigration welcomed by Trump voters come legally or don’t come
Remember this promise you made us @realDonaldTrump
We have got to back our elected president @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain
Glad to hear that, we are counting on you to keep your campaign promises. You have our support, please don't let us down.
Don't lose your base brother! Stick to what won you the election and you will win a second term.  We see what you're up against!
No vote for dreamers r anyone that came here illegally
.@realDonaldTrump was elected on his promise to deport ALL illegals. Now Trump is racing to suicide America w/ amnesty to 5M, DACA + family.
Build the damn wall without Congress. We will all buy sponsor bricks.
 Great Idea 
END DACA! Cut off all entitlements for illegals!
I'm fed-up w/ the bastards coming b/4 American Citizens!! The bastard ILLEGAL ALIENS keep taunting us! #LegalAmericansFirst
#EndDACA
We trust you
#NoAmnesty
#AmericaFirst
Thanks Papa Trump! <3
Or will there be..
What disappointed me was how fast ppl were willing to believe the libturds 
this was 2016, and I've heard no proof he has changed his mind
Build the wall. Whatever you do the wall must be built.
This is one agenda this American Hispanic voted for!  Stick to your word Don.
You LIED. #MAGA
better not be POTUS Trump. remember what you said about anchor babies!
WE want a wall & WE want illegals sent home.  Keep your promises & don't make deals with Dems cause you'll come out with short end of stick.
then what are you doing? No amnesty. Deportation now.
Do you remember this Mr President
Never forget.
Never forget!
So much for that
I'm super pissed right now. It's a slap in the face for those who worked to get here legally.
Go away
With @HillaryClinton ?

Correction, apparently there is amnesty, the Mexicans are rushing the border again and not one brick laid... poof! It was only a dream...
Oh that's slope!
BS yes there will
#NoSayJustPay
#NoDreamsForAmericanKids
Then keep this promise and stop the fucking games.
They have to go back.
Ahh. The good old days!
Keep the Promises - where is the Wall/where is the Tax Cut.? counting on you, and "now"...(not next year) no compromises!  @SpeakerRyan
No DACA. Build the wall. That was what we heard all through the campaign. You have done a great job so far, sir. Please stick to your plans.
Remember this @POTUS
Remember? This is how you got elected.
Sob
What the hell happened to you? This is the guy we elected and put faith in.
Remember thissss?????????????????????????????????
We will hold you to this, you hear this or is Kelly the one on your twitter now?
This is not in reference to DACA. On campaign trail, DJT repeatedly said he would review & decide DACA amnesty "because we have a heart".
"There will be no amnesty!"
#BuildtheWall
Repeat, please.......repeat, please....
@PressSec Hope he stays True to his promises. @realDonaldTrump
So nothing for us, but you jumped right on helping DACA ppl.  Great results too... Only took a week.
And a great big beautiful Wall!
From September 1st to now this has changed...stop pretending it hasn't. Don't be blind apologists.
Yes that is what was said then what  is said now? What about American kids first and Vets  jobs first over dreamers?
No amnesty .
No amnesty is "the right thing" for our country!



@realDonaldTrump  #NoAmnesty  This Better not be the 1st bill sent for signatures while AMERICANS still wait for #Repeal #TaxReform for US
I KNOW!
Mr. President I know. #NoAmnesty
I believe you.  I trust you.  #MAGA
I hope you haven't forgotten your own words @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

Remember.........……...REMEMBER
Your DACA deal is amnesty. Quit playing games with us.
@GOP Too many mixed, confusing and contradictory signals coming from both sides=complete chaos = nothing gets done=all voters  pissed off
This is 2017 - say that here and Now after your dinner with those two lying hypocrites. Can we trust you?
No amnesty no how
REPEAL AND REPLACE RINO RYAN @speakerryan progressive globalist, RINO says NO CHANCE BORDER WALL! FIRE RINO RYAN!
There will be no amnesty! #staywithus
Build the wall
WALL.    WALL.    WALL.   WALL.   WALL.
CC: @realDonaldTrump #nodaca #noamnesty #buildthewall #keepyourpromises
REMEMBER MR. PRESIDENT? YOU MADE A PROMISE!
@ProTrump001 Trump, bro, can you clarify who you're with again? Cuz I'm confused.
We will not forget what you PROMISED us when we voted you in. Do you WANT a 2nd term? We're a Nation of LAWS & CITIZENS, not "immigrants"
THANK YOU!
and there better not be GOTDAMMIT!
Everyone who chanted "Build the Wall" needs to tweet at @realDonaldTrump that we actually meant it. #nowallnodaca.
Sweet little lies
TWITTER is your ability to talk to us. I'm sorry for doubting u. It's just that you weren't tweeting. I'm with you! I won't doubt u again.
Whoops, he's not with us. This is a year old promise:(
https://twitter.com/Eliz_Hightower/status/907787204713480192 … I hope every liberal understands this is end result of what they are doing and it's terrifying !!!
.@realDonaldTrump 

MUSLIM ALERT
MUST SEE…
Keep your promise!
Why then, did he say, Congress has 6mos. to 'legalize' DACA?
Where did you miss, Trump is not ending DACA?
Another thing, how many more of us are going to die, before he shuts down the sanctuary cities?
President please reject amnesty. No entitlements or voting rights for 10yrs. Vetting and legal immigration process only!
@realDonaldTrump please remember the reasons we voted for you
#EndDACA and lock up #jerrybrown for meeting with #Mexico's officials to conspire to keep illegals here to send $ back to Mexico #LockHimUp
Make America Hateful ...trump sucks!!!
.
Just want to refresh your memory @realDonaldTrump  Don't give amnesty to DACA or you will lose many supporters.
Lets all see if this Tweet can gain NEW momentum and remind POTUS what he said and what we voted for. RT his tweet
What about now?
Donald keep your promises!!
It's nice to see a president with a backbone  u want to become an American get in line it's a privilege to become a u.s. citizen  !!
Law And Order ! Love it @POTUS 
what was the old Clinton saying? "This tweet is no longer operative" or sth like that
Campaign trump won. President trump is a joke
And nobody named Hilary Clinton in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump Remember your promises please Mr. President
Thank you Sir on behalf of my ancestors who came legally through yhe front door.
Thank you President Trump! You are one of the greats & appreciate you! You are #MAGA
@POTUS @SebGorka ??
Inquiring minds want to know...
One day they'll put the effort into making their own country great again instead of forcing us to compromise our laws for their benefit.
RT @julodiaz @eticayrepublica
He can not make up his mind.
Resign!! Before Mueller get you!!
A kingly pronouncement-- and your idiot base will love it.

That is todays story, what about tomorrow? You have waffled on that to many times to keep you core (moronic) supporters.

now that I want America great again B. Clinton  says I'm a racist. CLINTON, STOP WITH THE RACE CARD!
@CNN shut your racist cunt u will never be president
Can't wait to elect the first woman president. #ImWithHer
