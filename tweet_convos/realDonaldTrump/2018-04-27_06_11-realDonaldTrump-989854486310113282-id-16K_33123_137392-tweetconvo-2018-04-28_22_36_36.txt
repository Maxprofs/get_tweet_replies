It's a shame to watch the liberal hate mob attack Kanye for wanting positive change in America...
TWO WINNERS!
Umm did everyone forget this moment
Maybe he woke up & sees all the previous lies. @kanyewest can help MAGA. He is a very influential black male. Be a leader show young Black peoples to respect & back the blue - stand up respect our men & women in the military - respect our President @realDonaldTrump.
Kanye West can’t show me anything except how to be a sellout! #fuckkanye
My my my ...look how mad some people get when they aren't able to tell someone else what to do 
Look how asinine people appear when they comment on things beyond their comprehension...this is deeper than telling someone else “what to do” but you don’t know that, of course 
Good try....it's telling someone else what to do. Lol
Black Unemployment Under Obama: 16.8% 

Black Unemployment Under Trump: 6.9%
Don't mention legacy, that's an attempt to limit my free thought. #DragonSomething
Trump could make every black person a millionaire, stop all the wars in Africa, and people would still call him a racist. The statistics are in and blacks are striving more now than ever, because of @realDonaldTrump not @BarackObama. #Facts

This is kinda racist.
Yeah it's now racist to appreciate service for the black community. What world are you living in?

The people that respond with only gifs and can't make actual arguments have very little brain power. You clearly fall under the category
I think responding in gif form is actually intelligent because you have to make connections with pop culture and also recognize the person you’re responding to is a lost cause.
That sounds like logic straight from the mouth of a clearly unoriginal, simple minded, SJW trying to make stupid things sound smart.
How bout instead you explain to me how trumps tweet was in any way racist? Justifying dumbing yourself down because you're not capable of critical thinking doesn't do anyone good
How about you read my thread where I already explained it rather than have me do it again for your convenience?

Kanye West does not represent black America
Now you have two african americans.
Kanye X Trump colab coming after that Cudi album drops.
Today is #DragonEnergyFriday!
Fire Mueller so we can riot already
And nobody is going to riot
Nobody cares about Kanye. Seriously nobody.

Trump Takes Undue Credit on Black Unemployment - http://FactCheck.org 
Need to put more black issues on the table, you,re get more black support , from your one of black Republicans

I'm more of an M.O.P. fan myself

You know who matters more than Kayne ? James Shaw Jr, the guy who wrestled a gun from a shooter. Duck Kanye.
I could list several others? Notable men and women in history. Your point? Your claim that a heroic deed makes another invalid is sickening to me.
god you are so cancer

They should all be in prison .
Kanye West changed the entire paradigm by putting on that MAGA hat!!!
You should hear the conversations now. Total shift of mentality in many people. Kanye is not just another rapper. He is truly a cultural force.
A cultural force.....or #FARCE ??

this is a step towards getting him to hear what we've been trying to convey for decades/centuries
You literally would not say any of this if he wasn’t supporting you..
You’re so full of crap.

The Black community does not claim your lovechild.
@kanyewest is trash, he's a industry tool. He just killed his legacy, RIP. @chancetherapper & @darrellscott they really don't get it but they slave for the cause. I wonder how stupid to they feel that Sir Pissyface tied they thank you black unemployment, this what they don't get.
Yeah, boycott everyone for having different opinions!
Just the ones with ignorant opinions.
You just liked your own reply lmao.
Pathetic 
Only fools don't like what they say because 9 out of 10 it's bullshit. On the other hand I'm confident in my remarks & I like them. So in your case you don't like what you say & nobody else either, lmao.
Sometimes I wonder why there isn’t a IQ requirement to vote.. or one to allow you to share political opinions online.
You’re the reason I think of such things today.
Congratulations.
You think @kanyewest represents the black community?!!?

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! 
Exactly!  They know nothing about Kanye.  He is all about his coins and he is a genius at it.  His new song just dropped. 
You gotta give it to him tho. He's on point. 
Lol always.  I don't know what the hell the lyrics "poopity scoop" means yet but he basically is talking shit .   #GetYourMoneyHoney. #UseEmUp
Yo shut up fam
@Martina ICYMI 

$342M in global profits, nearly $200M in share buybacks to reward international investors, 1 shuttered American plant and 160 lost American jobs. Make no mistake, that is the legacy of the #GOPTaxScam. 
You gotta stop with this unemployment rate stuff man. Parading it around like “hey black ppl, look what I’m doing for you”. It dropped from 16% to 7% under Obama.
The unemployment rate doesnt mean anything anyways. If people stop looking for a job, they arent counted for in that statistic.
Delete @chancetherapper; he was trying to be famous for something besides Cheerio commercials. That honey is nuts, alright.

Lord dampnut or Tiny Hands, (whichever you go by) Where’s Mr. Shaw’s praise?

James Shaw Jr. is paying for the funeral of each of the four Waffle House shooting victims out of the gofundme monies raised for him.

Retweet if you agree that this man is a TRUE American hero!!!
..... I come from a long line of patriots. My grandfather died in Vietnam, both grandfathers fought in the war. My husband left for a deployment when our daughter was 3 days old.

This monster in the WH mocks everything the military stands for.
More than likely, President Clueless, @kanyewest feels himself slipping into irrelevance. This is just an attention-grabbing stunt. You know, like you've always done. He's learning well from the Kardashians that even bad press is better than no press.
Medgar Evers, Sojourner Truth, John Lewis, W.E.B DuBois, Rosa Parks, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr, and last but not least BARACK OBAMA, just to name a few that ppl think of as far as "legacy stuff". Kanye West, not so much. 
My girl is feisty 


Keep telling yourself this
The truth is always easy to tell!
Truth? What do Trumpers know about truth?
Here is some truth for ya!


The issue this hour- explain how trump is trying to control drug crisis when his own dr. Is Doling out ambien and painkillers without scripts? Can’t wait to hear the excuse you come up with!!
No excuse. The left just lies! And you believe the nonsense. Why do all you liberals live your life so angrily? You seem soooooo angry.
There are 3.6 Million black children in poverty in America.  Democrats @DNC are more interested in helping criminal illegal aliens than American children. 

Think about that... #DemocratsHateAmerica 
#CrookedHillary #BLM #ImpeachTrump
Name one song by Chance, fast!
Thanks @BarackObama  for leaving office w/low unemployment rates that continued as your policies continued to produce results! Stop taking credit for others work @realDonaldTrump & name 1 policy that you enacted that has helped w/Black unemployment rate? Just 1! There isn't any.
LOL

WTF!!!!!! 
“I’d never support anyone who has made a career out of hatred, racism, and discrimination. I’d never support someone who’d talk about Chicago as if it’s hell on earth [sic] and then take steps to make life harder here for the most disenfranchised among us.” - @chancetherapper
This is 'Legacy stuff' the rest is just White Noise!!

James Shaw Jr. is paying for the funeral of each of the four Waffle House shooting victims out of the gofundme monies raised for him.
More junk to smoke screen your imminent impeachment. We’re hip to you.
WTF are you going on about? For the first time? Seriously? You always make it about you. Go. Get. HELP! Or not.
Hey Tubby, why haven't you mentioned the 4 victims of the Waffle House shooting or hero James Shaw Jr.?
I won't lie, big things ARE happening, and it's definitely been an eye-opener. But not, I suspect, in the way you mean.
Slaves had 100% employment. What does a job mean when U can't afford school or ur home? U taking credit 4 policies enacted under @BarackObama. Addr the unjustice system jailing POC, income inequality, poor education in POC communities. Real thinkers aren't buying what you selling

James Shaw Jr. performed a great service to the community.   Much more than Kanye ever will.   You can't even say his name.  You are a disgrace.   #Resign

What about honoring James Shaw junior Waffle House hero.

Tell the people the Truth about what are sptlraying in the skies of the world!!! Aluminium, barium and strontium!!! You are trying to pull the wool over their eyes for your agenda and to bring in the new world order!!! You are not a leader!!! You are a puppet on a string!!!!
Donald, Chance doesn’t like you
KKKanye is a traitor to America, just like you. Both of you have Grand Dragon Power.

Hate on @kanyewest all you want, but being on the good side of one of the most powerful men on the planet isn’t a bad thing 
Most Republicans know enough to kiss Trumps ass. It appears to be contagious.
This mutha-

James Shaw Jr. 

He is the 29 year old unarmed man who attacked and disarmed the Waffle House shooter to save his life and the lives of many others. President Trump has completely ignored his heroic acts.

Let's all give James Shaw Jr. a HUGE "Thank You".
Make it go viral!
Lol...MAGA people forget Kanye went on a little "vacation " and is supposed to be on vacation. You trust that bullshit you want to. But, as they say, birds of a feather, flock together. Or, rather, takes one to know one. 
And none of his new MAGA followers are going to buy his shitty music or his ugly clothes so what has he gained?
Hopefully a commitment to a psych ward....one where he can take a friend (Orange Santanicus).
@imelda_ndeda did you just RT this???
Grant, your Tl says i did yeah? ... Doesn't necessarily mean I agree though..
How can you RT what you don't agree with? 
Huuuh!!! You didn't just ask that
Cannot wait for your indictment!!
Eyes should be opened to your continual lies and hatred. I get it.......you are appealing to your base at the expense of the rest of the world. You make my blood boil
Thank you trump for ending the korean war and inventing rap
Kanye West? 
Mr. Dragon blood? 
You'd praise the Devil himself if he said something flattering about you.
Plz don't speak for chance or the rest of the Black Community....sincerely black guy
And a Black unarmed man saved the lives of many people by taking a AR15 from a naked White man, but he doesn't got nothing from your sorry ass.

We get JayZ and Queen Bey so you can keep @kanyewest , we're good  #BlackLivesMatter

His new song must be dedicated to you: Poopity Scoop!
He’s as messed up as you are.

Glad to see him realize the truth. Kanye did way more for us than Obama ever did.
No, Dr. Darrell Scott doesn't get it -- we need a New Deal for Black America, due to long history in America, not an Urbanization Deal. Bring back the New Deal for Black America.
Sadly some people feel they must apologize for speaking their mind, having their opinions, expressing their thoughts.   

Would you apologize for your freedom of speech?
The minute Kanye gets on a stage and people boo him he will have an epic melt down. This will be fun
Rule changes under Obama (must work part time or volunteer or begin training for jobs) in order to receive SNAP/food stamps.

These changes forced people to work in order to keep the benefits.

Obama stopped people capable of working getting free food which increased employment
Course it's the lowest unemployment rate for Hispanic because you're sending them out of the country
can't wait for the sleeves to roll up
Yep!
Damn. @chancetherapper, you’re officially complicit.
You’re a fool
Thanks Obama!
Remember the “good people” marching and carrying torches in Charleston?  Kanye probably  disagreed with that statement, I hope!
All of your supporters do! The greatest collection of people have come together in a United front that will make history 
Can’t have unemployed black people if the cops kill em first! 

@kanyewest for President 2020

This sounds racist....somehow.
Isn’t it amazing that the man the media has labeled as racist and bigot has Black unemployment at 6.9% while the media darling “Barack” had it at 16.8%. Yea Okay! Sure! That’s a very Nazy thing to do.........

MSM is something else man!.........
Thank you Mr President we the American people are all equal and you are the first in a very long time to recognize this
Before you take credit for black unemployment, look at what it was when Obama took office and what it was when he left. Honor what he did and you can take credit for your tiny piece. Otherwise cut the nonsense
Get it through your head that you're reaping the benefits from the years of Obama's doing. It has been going down. You have done nothing.
That shows the state of your eyes and the limited range of „sight“ and mind you got one more time.....  Sad, to use your words, Very Sad...
What has Kanye really done?
don - about the conspiracy - does Kayne know do you think? #TrumpRussiaConspiracy #GOPTrumpRussiaCoverup
Your on met with a Russian informant!!!
#DragonEnergy #FireAndFury #MAGA 
I don't have to boycott Key West or whatever his name, because I don't like him, never have. I don't and I never liked you either. And didn't vote for you! I detest you as a matter of fact!
I second that! And I think it’s 
Kenya wess
Should be Kaynie White-kardashian!
This tweet is to quote @realDonaldTrump  "Very dishonest and sick!"
He has been tweeting all day! @realDonaldTrump is a very sick and confused man
That he is. Unfortunately..
diamond and silk has done more than kanye!!!!
It’s because they know only  what @Buzzfeed, @CNN, and other #FakeNewsMedia tell them.
Can i get a retweet or share. Thanks
Is it because the song “Gold Digger” resonates with you?
Spoiler alert: Kanye hasn't done a darn thing for blk community. Sorry, try again!

You are some piece of work. You praise west bc he supports you. THAT is the ONLY reason. 

How about acknowledging a TRUE hero, James Shaw Jr. He stopped a killer from murdering more people. Oh but James is black & the killer is white, so that doesn't fit your racist paradigm.
He is a crazy loon just like you.

Black unemployment has been steadily lowering since 2010. You’re not responsible for this; Obama is.
One racist liking another one
You rock!  Keep up the great work!
Time for the swamp rats to do their damn job. 9% approval rating..., shameful and embarrassing!
What Obama do for the black man? Food stamps, welfare, free phones, all the things to keep a black man down and under their control.  Wake up; Trump has a job for you.

Saying Kanye has done a great service to the black community equates to stating David Ernest Duke has done a great service to the white community.

Geez, how did you get into power?
Thanks to this real President, the one responsible for starting the real noticeable difference in unemployment going down for all races!
Christians in Nigeria and other tribes being killed daily by his tribes Fulani militia while he looks the other way! USA should urgently help!
Yes he’s put them back 50 years. You’d like that wouldn’t you.

@chancetherapper this is why it’s important to think before you speak or hit send. Now he’s using you.
About black unemployment, excellent news and a continuous improvement since 2010.
President Donald Trump making America great again for all Americans!
What are the big things that are happening? Last person to turn on the black community was Bill Cosby. That’s working out real well.
 you disgust me.
Thank you to all who support America ... the Democrats are going to crash and burn.  If they don't eat themselves first!  Love #KayneWest and #Roseanne who have the courage to think for themselves.
This is the reason why I get pissed when I hear Trump bragging on the lowest black unemployment rates like he had any hand in it. It's called a trend.  Here's the link to the data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000006 … #realnews #resultsappropriation
Why is everyone so upset by this exactly? Kanye West's biggest claims to fame are being a rapper and being married to a woman whose biggest claims to fame are a sex tape no one wants to see and plastic surgery.
Hush little baby- dont say a word
I love Kanye's music, but must admit there's nothing to learn about him..
Who told you that Kanye speaks for or represents the black community?
It's even about race? Things aren't getting any simpler.
He did a favor for your propaganda team. That's it.
Idiot(s)
These same people would not cross the street to piss on Kanye if he was on fire if he was not acting totally subservient to Trumputin!I am sure that they think that every Rich white guy with a mansion in the South needs a Uncle Tom for his Maralago plantation! Yeezy & Sleazy SAD!

Every damn day my hatred/contempt grows deeper for this moron.  #NotMyPresident #LiarInChief #TheResistance

Hey, Donny...what about the black guy in the Waffle House?? What's he....chopped liver??

Curious, did you sing the same praises for James Shaw Jr. for saving lives and raising money to pay for the ones that weren’t?
Yes he has!

We aren't claiming kanye anymore... So if you want to claim him as a white we're cool with it.

He has 100% failed the black community, and is so obviously being used by trump as a puppet to pretend he’s not an oppressor and that he cares for POC. Money does crazy things to people.
