Great, an ancient, unhealthy, dude and his team are there. I AM SO SURE THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL
#KurtSmolek #KlausEberwein #PeterSmith #BerantonWhisenant #MonicaPetersen all dead, all have ties to @HillaryClinton but nothing to see @FBI

Add #JosephRago to the #ClintonBodyCount list ...
I volunteered at NRG Shelter in Houston today. Everyone worked hard to make evacuees feel safe and cared for. No one said "I'm Team Trump."
In fact, no one mentioned you at all. We just said, "How can we serve?" We are #TeamTexas #TeamHouston #TeamWeGotThis
World peace
I am absolutely POSITIVE that you cannot be more weary than those directly affected by either hurricane. Learn some sensitivity.
Well he never said he was more weary than them so....
Tell us about it, we've been weary of you for quite some time.  No rest is right, until you're out of office
Imagine if you could possibly tweet for a day without using any self-promoting personal pronouns? #lacksempathy
Thank you Mr. President. I'm in Fl and I feel safer knowing you are in control! Thank you for being the President our country so deserves!
NOT GOOD
that's, a lot, of hesitant, pausing
Fake news of the day!
hey Donny: FYI -- you're President of Puerto Rico too. #Irma
Cuz this is all about you? Do U have to mention yourself or your team in every tweet? How bout just saying #ourcountry is doing all we can
no rest for those losing their homes and families either...
Texas is is still drowning what exactly is your "team" doing
I think you mean "wicked"
No gas on I-75 north evacuation route
You ALWAYS say you & your bozos are doing a "good job" Donnie. It's par for the course for a psycho with an ego like yours.
Correction: Not YOUR team. It's OUR team the American people. YOU work for US. Get it straight.
I hear FEMA is running out of money. Let's use that wall money to save lives and rebuild from disasters worsened by climate change!
IMPEACH NOW!
I live in Florida and so very much appreciate Trump staying on top of this.  I remember other times when Obama did not or showed up late.
God bless you President Trump. You are on top of things with these horrible storms. We The Ppl love you
Lol
You use, more commas, than me, and I use way, way too many.
"YOU" don't have a team. You are a president. It is not YOUR team.  Put your ego on hold for five minutes.  Resign!
You LIE!!
Maybe bring scientists back?
Maybe appoint scientists to.postitions that require scientists?
Srsly? We're supposed to be concerned about the weariness of "your" team? What about the ppl directly affected? <smh> #whatempathy?
It's "no rest for the wicked," you perfumed pillock.
The weary?? R u kidding me? U even put their work above those victims' experience! #uranasshole #Twittler #Impeach45
These people certainly aren't *your* team. Matter of fact nothing about this has been helped by you personally yet. #resign
Please shut up
Thank you President Trump along with our beautiful first lady. Your  and appreciation for for being there in Houston x2 .Your loved by 
you'd see it a lot better from the 9th tee at Mar-a-Lago......take @DonaldJTrumpJr  and @seanhannity with you.
LMAO..you're probably only watching it because it's on Fox News, and they're likely blaming the hurricane on @BarackObama or @HilaryClinton
@realdonaldtrump fam ur sentence structure is trash
YOUR team?!
So you ARE weary. Wonder why. I had hoped for more from you than empty rhetoric. You got what you asked for. Help #MAGA
God bless you president Trump! We could not do this without you and your Administration. Thank you for helping all those affected!!!
@DistlerJoyce Yes, ALL of you have done a wonderful job!
Yeah why don't you take a closer look, perhaps in the eye?
This would be a great time to visit MarALago. You should relax right on the beach until the storm passes. You deserve it, Donnie! Enjoy!
Comma much?
Such an ignorant buffoon 
F! you #SoCalledPresident you won't be here when this hurricane hit us and you will just be bragging about how F#%in&a great you are!
No one should be there when it hits. There's an evacuation notice. Lol silly.
Keep up the good work Mr. President
Hey trump, you going to hang out at Mar-A-Lago this weekend? Please.
A fantastic president. I can't think of one thing that Obama has done in his 8 years that equals Trumps 9 months in office.
That's what a good team is all about , all for all and a great spirt of kindness
True! #WeatherModification, #WeatherPatents, #HAARP, #RedCrossHistory, #MichioKaku, #RedCrossNWOconnection
Thank you President Trump,I'm in Florida with my family and you and your team being ready to help relives a lot of our worries.
No rest for any of us since you became ..... you know.  I still can't say it.
You are leading the greatest hurricane recovery operation ever Mr President 
God bless the greatest President on Earth! So proud of you! 
 u Trump
Great job to you and you team Sir.. hats off!! #MAGA
President Trump is proactive & has an action plan- his patriotism makes all the difference! #MAGA
President Trump! We are so proud of the work you have been doing preparing for 2 of the worst hurricanes to hit the U.S. in almost 100 yrs
Thank you for your sincere concern . So proud of my POTUS!
Oh bullshit! Your "team", my ass! Can't even get your buddy repubs to pass emergency funding!
Please dont forget about the US Virgin Islands! They need immediate federal aid and support!
does ur team have any concern 4 fires burning out of control on the West Coast? #columbiagorge is on fire in case u didn't hear
Don't forget the US Virgin Islands. The people down there are Americans too.
Your team? You mean the volunteers who are there helping the ones you WON'T help?
It's " no rest for the wicked" 
Instead of making a big wall make a big hoover and suck it in #jobsorted #fezforpresident @simonjamesgrant
Oh, haven't you heard? @rushlimbaugh says it's no big deal! He filled his audience in on how everyone is overreacting to #IRMA So no worries
2 other US countries are about to get hit before Florida, what has your team done? You talk more about DACA & not about saving peoples lives
No rest for over using commas.
Don't forget Puerto Rico it's part of the US and was hit first along with St Thomas and St Croix
How about Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands? Do they get Help?'
That's so weird. I haven't seen or heard from anyone on your team down here. Or get your resort on the golf course ready. Oh that team.....
"Watching"? Careful. You wouldn't want to admit you rely on #MSM field journalists to stay informed once you actually need their legwork.
It's not all about you and your team
Maybe we should put the DREAMers to work building the wall as part of their reparations for costing us our tax dollars. #DACA.
Sorry for your inconvenience orange sir. Hopefully you'll catch a break soon.
God is not pleased at what is happening - beware and take notice
You should only be caring about doing the job for others, rather than doing the job for yourself and then saying it is "such a good job".
Please...please get up real close and get a good look at climate change in action.
Do you consider Golf work?
Only when it's me doing the golfing.
     
Great job in Texas
Can someone pls start a relief fund for Barbuda and St. MARTIN, they are getting little to no help
Thank you @realDonaldTrump 
Your folks are doing a great job, Mr President. Thank you for them. I sure urge them to stay safe over the next few days.
Thank you for all the great things you are doing for our country
Thank you@realDonaldTrump
Loading..
This country needs to come together and needs to help each other... this also applies to humanity In general.. tough times need love!
Thank you President Trump!!!
Mr. President we need you on Montana!! Deadliest Wildfire season in 35 years!! Thousands of folks have evacuation orders.
Floridian's appreciate that!  Thank you for your support!
Keep doing a good job and to hell with the critics. You earned it so own it
Traitor Donny you are. Presidential you aren't...

YOUR TEAM? WHO IS LEFT WORKING FOR YOU, THAT HAVE NOT QUIT OR HAVE BEEN FIRED?
What about the Americans in st marten. They need help also.
Global Warming, in your face
Make America great again by #GreenNewDeal #MedicareForAll #100%Renewable2035 #ForgiveStudentDebt #EndTheWar #JailTheBanksters #DrainTheSwamp
Praying for all
You ended your tweet with a misspelling.  "Treasonous" is not spelled W-E-A-R-Y.
He's at his huuuge N.J. estate watching us being decimated with winds and floods! Nice. Mara-lago may not be there when and if you return 
But then you escaped to your estate in NJ!!!! Your Palm Beach estate may be decimated.  Us others hunkering down. Flooding 120 mph winds!!!
Saw all the agencies that received your 1 million. Thanks for donating to the Humane society, Mr. President!

Harvey---largest rainfall---Ever- on  US. Irma--strongest storm---Ever---in Atlantic. San Fran--consecutive 100' days. Climate change Prez?
WORST. PRESIDENT. EVER.
The actual phrase is " no rest for the wicked", just saying.
You wanna do something? Get rid of price controls and let prices work, price gougers should be given a medal.
Bet Trump rebuilds marlago with foreign labor Ha!!!!!!
I think the quote is "no rest for the wicked"
Give Trump a chance! So many prejudice haters want to piggyback on any tweets from President Trump with their political slurs. Get over it
Your team?? Are you paying them from your own pocket? #bigheaded

GLoBal WarMiNg!ยก
Hey Donnie, if you're so tired, maybe you should just resign and go back to scamming wives and investors. #TrumpCheater #TrumpRussia
Thank you for what you do!!
How about watching climate science after the country pulls through this. #ClimateAction
Politics is not you fine point. Quit, and go back to "Apprentice" Donald Trump. We loved you then. Your a JERK now! God save America!
PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD DONALD TRUMP!!!
what happens if you open an oreo and theres no creme inside?
"My team ..." ??
Does EVERYTHING have to belong to you?
Why can't you say something like "Volunteers are working tirelessly..." ?
Quit blaming Obama for everything.
! That makes you look like a weak leader. It's your turn now, show you can lead like we thought you could
Are you going to build a wall to keep that out too ?
In spite of you! FEMA missing key people in leadership positions and running out of funding you orange fool! Get out of the way. Pathetic..
Like you're filling sandbags and boarding up windows?  Don't suggest this is so tough for you tweeting in your bathrobe! LMAO! Fool!!
Stand a bit closer please.
Fake president
Are you opening Mar-a-lago as a shelter?
@realDonaldTrump DEPORT ALL ILLEGALS! AMERICA ISNT MEXICO!
I expect you're watching much more closely than anyone else!
Hope Irma visits Maralago and stays there awhile. Please go there for the weekend. Golf will be good for you!!!!  You need the exercise!
Yo no hablo ingles no se que hago aqui :v
You mean they can't go golfing? Lead by example. #POUTS this isn't reality tv, this is LIFE 
U need to watch the price gouging in states like Florida during an emergency and fine the stores doing so triple
How are they doing a good job in Texas and simultaneously already in Florida? #twoplacesatonce
Fake news
President Trump & his team Rock the House.                                                                                 Maga...
Let's see if you and the Republican congress appropriate just as much money for the people of Puerto Rico. 
It's all about YOU and YOUR team right? #ArrogantAss No. Tell us you care about the affected. You know... other people. #NeverTrump
You should have said "no rest for the wicked", and that's wicked in the pejorative sense not the vernacular that means "cool".
Lol no one likes you
Best president EVER!!! Texas thanks you!! America thanks you!! @realDonaldTrump
Doing a great job
Your team is doing a good job? By watching the storm on tv from N Dakota while you talk taxes & ignore disasters?
I know you don't sleep much, Mr. Pres, but hope u have a chance to get in a few good hours of shut-eye. You will need it in the days ahead!
Until you tackle #climatechange YOU ARE THE PROBLEM, and your bandaid #solutions are a joke.
Its "our team" you narcissistic orange buffoon!!! You work for US !!!!!
Closely... you think you're a superman...?
its crazy down here right now, gas stations are running of gas. places are picked clean of water/food & places are already price gouging
Please help #Montana too!
Which one, stupid? There's 3 of them
Who's paying you to say this?
bigly watching I assume @devilradio

Prayers for all. 
God bless you @realDonaldTrump & all those working to #MAGA.
You don't have a team.  You did next to nothing for Texas.  Stop taking credit for things real Americans do.  There is NO team Trump
I don't even read anymore beyond your original statements sir.  I just hear this big sucking sound (lemons) & a loud whine (democrats)
Really wondering what you have done to make yourself weary?!? #draintheovaloffice #please
Hi
It's not about you and your team you twit - it's about the people whose lives are being ruined by Irma, as opposed to the ones ruined by you
Please. Stop tweeting every stupid thing that pops into your stupid little brain. Nothing in this tweet is of any interest to anyone.
 Praying for this massive storm to turn back to sea. Act of God, or man-made?  Who controls HAARP and http://geoengineeringwatch.org  ?
Just to be clear your prayers my to the same deity who created and aimed the storm on its path to suddenly change its course?
Have you considered the cognitive dissonance of praying to the same god to save you as is actively putting you in harms way?
Did you even click on the link?  These are man-made disasters:
Why is everything YOUR team, or YOUR generals? They work for the government, as you do. This isn't Trump, Inc.
Yeah, can't just give encouragement without patting yourself on the back, can you?
Awesome
