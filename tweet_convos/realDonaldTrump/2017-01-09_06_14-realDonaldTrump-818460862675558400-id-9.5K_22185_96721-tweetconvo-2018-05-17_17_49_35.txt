This had nothing to do with you.  Stop taking credit for work you didn't do.
Even before inauguration, the only President who brought so many positive. Praying for your successes.
Amazing what a little leadership will accomplish. 6 days away and Obama is gone. A national day of celebration.

thanks Obama for saving the auto industry and UAW & Co. for getting this done 16 mos ago!

Thanks Obama!  4 more years please.

it had nothing to do with you.  Taking credit where it's not due, pathetic
is twitter deleting your account? I've seen it reported on Facebook
Thanks Obama! Maybe you can save some too without paying for it. #TinyHandsDonaldTrump
Chrysler Fiat was in works long before you ran for office. But we all know you'll try to take credit for it.
why doesn't @MLauer report this awesome news vs. spending 5 minutes on your son-in-law Sr. Advisor? #Agenda

Good one Israel4trump
Ummm... TRAITOR MUCH?? 
Good job Mr. President. So proud of you. Love, one of your California Precinct Coordinators. Turn Cali red in 2020!
I hear when you were a child your mother wanted to hire somebody to take care of you, but the mafia wanted too much.
You can thank President Obama for those new jobs. You'll find him busy running the damned country, not tweeting. #riseup
but Chrysler/Fiat wouldn't even be here today to do this if it wasn't for uhhhh who? Not you!
every time you open your mouth your nose pokes millions of Americans eyes! That's called Pinocchio effect! #liar
they announced this months ago.
Trying to take fame for something that happened more than a year ago. THIS WAS NOT DONE BY YOU!!! #Lyingsackofshit
But that didn’t stop Donald Trump from associating himself with the plan on Twitter.
..the McCarren-WalterAct 1952 is for your use now!
Fiat was planning to stay before your angry tweetstorm#notmypresident.
fake news
FluffyBanana
as usual, this successful business development had nothing to do with you
Mr Trump thank God you got elected.  I'm retired Leo they taking 60 percent of my social security wins fall penalty is bad
liberals think that they are fooling people. and that citizens are ignorant. They are so ignorant its laughable .
Chrysler states this decision was made LONG before U  tired of your LIES!  #DontheCon
By the way u looked foolish attacking Meryl Streep for telling truth about your disgusting action caught in tape.
what about the ones that are leaving ORANGE
Thank you President Barack Obama for bailing out the auto industry!
I would ask how old you are, but I know you can't count that high.

thank you President Barack Hussein Obama.
Lying piece if shit FORD AND THE UAW ANNOUNCED THIS A YEAR AGO. Do you ever speak truth you pathetic asshole?
people need to remember this when car shopping
This is something that the union leaders made happen. Trump had nothing to do with this.
Monica Crowleys use of other people's work doesn't bother you - claiming other peoples work like FIAT deal is your normal.

Yeah, sure, Russian puppet, they make those decisions overnight.  I can hardly stand the sort of loser you are.
you had nothing to do with that
This was planned long ago, and you're not president yet. So quit patting yourself on the back for things you never did.
had nothing to do with it
