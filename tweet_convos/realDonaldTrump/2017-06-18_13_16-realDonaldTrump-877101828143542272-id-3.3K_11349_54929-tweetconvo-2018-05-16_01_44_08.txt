You are a great man @SheriffClarke
He let a man die of thirst.  You must be an extraordinarily cruel person to equate that with greatness.
He didn't personally do that Gus. It was the C/O's on the floor at that time.
He was the responsible person in charge.  He's under investigation as a result.
And it will come up with Bupkiss just like ridiculous Russia investigation. Just more hysteria and distractions from the losing side.
1) What's on the dockets in the Eastern District of Virginia then?  I know Trump personally.  Do you?
I don't reside in Virginia.
Very telling as to the FBI investigation. It appears that Flynn flipped, & the bells tolls for DJT.
Happy Fathers day #POTUS
Any true Airborne Ranger wouldn't waste a moment of his/her honorable time doing anything but trying to end Dingleberry Trump's term BALM.
By All Legal Means!!!
Happy Fathers Day sheriff Clarke enjoy your day keep safe as always we have no sympathy for politicians feeding targeted.
When politicians did nothing to protect our police we have no sympathy for them karma served
Sanctuary cities endanger citizens and those  congressmen feel they need protection we recommend they stay at work doing work.
Factually untrue. Sanctuary cities are universally supported by local police and make us all safer. City police AREN'T ICE
Police don't universally support sanctuary cities you're wrong what moron would support sanctuary cities? It's not Americans just misfits
Come to Texas sanctuary illegal aliens police will take you to nearest ICE detention center for faster deportation process
That's not their job & they don't want to do it. Takes away from local policing which IS their sworn duty.
Thank you for your service
...happy Father's Day to you both...y'all  are great American heroes...thank y'all  for your service & your love for America...#MAGA
Once again, unlike you. The draft dodger.


My dad called me a loser and then i stopped being a loser, its called tough love... maybe your dad shouldve done the same to you, loser
Nah i look like someone who loves their country and isnt afraid to express it :^)
Maybe if you spent less time twitter stalking youd be cool
LOL, you look like an effin clown.
Oh man you got me
True legend ^
Happy Father's Day, Mr. Clarke! Thank you for your service. My son recently joined the Navy. He will serve proudly, and support Trump! 
sheriffe i hate cavanhaques please shave i hate hats i hate suglasses i hate grey color i hate adidas too shave thanks happy father day
Happy Fathers Day to two great men!

Thank your Dad for his service and for having you a great American
I have the video. Your not above the law.
Do you seriously think Trump cares? He doesn't even know what that means!
Examples to follow... You are everything America is all bout.
We salute him. However Trump avoided serving. At his rally he was proud a vet gave him his Purple Heart. Trump said he always wanted one. 
God bless your Dad for his Service! 
Thank you to him
Oh you come from a whole line of Coons lol
Did he collude with Russia too?
I bet your Dad is super disappointed in you!
Thank you for your service to this great nation.
Happy Father's Day to you both! Thank you both for your service and love for our great nation 
Sheriff Clarke: I am retired Philly PD, Det. Sgt.
You are a real credit to our law enforcement community.
Respectfully,
Robert Hackert
Fantastic photo #happyfathersday

he's not "he an"
Rangers lead the way.
Dude lay off Trump's nuts. You're literally obsessed with him. I'm starting to think you're gay for him. #weird
Can't even say happy Father's Day to your dad without talking about trump.
Happy Father's Day to all the patriotDads! There is no responsibility that is more important in society than loving,responsible dads. #DMAGA

Ty you for your service brother it was men like you that enabled me to serve 82 to 87 Deering piece time you are very appreciated
He must be sad that you're a Democrat!
GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS
Don't back out of Trumps team
Nonsense Clarke is a killer plain and simple
Sheriff Clarke shld be in jail for treatment of prisoners in his jail & anyone that disagrees w him get extrajudicial treatment by his staff
Unlike U, he earned the right 2 wear Dress Blues at 16. Don't U find it@all disrespectful, parading around dicked out in Faux Dress Blues?
Remember that time Milwaukee Pastor Darryl Williams said Fox News saw U as that "Black face that will legitimize their views‚Äù?
Go back to bed Donzo
@SheriffClarke  I'm your biggest fan bby 
Like father like son!
And you wear a little boys wannabe uniform with fake medals, he must be proud.
He lives in a mobile home?  Nice son he has.
May The Lord bless you and your dad
We're thankful to your father for his service to our country.
and not a word from a special counselor or the media right? Double standard
The double standard is in the GOP. The same senator who filed for impeaching Bill now say a president can't obstruct. Brush up old articles.
That is not a good man there. You align yourself with some of the worst ppl in our society. Plz resign Sir.
That was some good English.
Sooo if Donald Trump your real daddy? Did you also borrow all those medals you wear from your father?
What kind of person are u to tweet something like that weird troll
A horrible one with no life...but this kind of unnecessary crap is totally cool with the #Left..makes them feel good about themselves!
Clarke is a phony. And that gun in your picture only makes your dick small. I'm all for gun ownership, but gun worship is for fools.
Classy! I am not worshipping my gun at all but you can think that and draw whatever conclusions you like! Have a nice day!
RT @SheriffClarke: Happy Father's Day to all dads. My dad. Like father, like son, @realDonaldTrump supporters to the end...
God Bless your father and you. Thank you to him for his service. 
God bless him! Tell him thank you for his service!  My 94 year old grandpa is a veteran and we honor him and keep him safe and cared for
Check your grammar in your last sentence, trumptard!
So this is the person who made you into what you are today.
My condolences.
Thank You for your service
David A Clarke , JR. is a true patriot.And I would love to see hem take law enforcement .Job in US, GOV.
We have American military warriors wasting away in Leavenworth prison. Their crime, doing their job, protecting us. Please help!
And you didn't have the balls to enlist. 23yrs and counting on active duty, sheriff fake ribbons.
I know your Dad is proud of you. Pls tell him America is proud of you too. Lucky to have you.

Happy Fathers' Day, Sheriff Clarke!
You must be delusional to think that America is proud of this guy
there's a picture that young man will cherish the rest of his life I know I would
Great picture Sheriff Clarke!
@realDonaldTrump üñì@SheriffClarke happy father's day.
And DEFINITELY FUCK TRUMP!


Happy Father's Day Sheriff and to Mr Clarke Sr! Great Americans & Patriots!
Thank you Father Clarke for your service. Appreciate both of you for the service you have done for our country all your life! God bless!
My Dad was career Air Force.  No way would he be going around looking like a wanna-be with fake medals.
You only shared this because they're black, Trumpy.
. No vets that I know support this weak, cowardly draft dodger.
Clearly you‚Äôre not bothered at all by the fact that @realDonaldTrump is a cowardly draft dodger who let others die in his place.
Beautifull
Really, this is who you retweet? Crazy begets crazy.
My grandfather fought in Korea. #heroes

Happy Fathers Day to you both!
Little late
Thanks for your and your father's service.  My brother jumped twice in Korea --173d Airborne
"Dumb and Dumberer"
Sheriff Clarke, please thank your father on my behalf for his contributions to the world! Hope you had a great time with him!
Happy Fathers Day!!!!!
Thank you, sir.

Amazing how many traitors were veterans...
No fake medals for the day?
He was an airborne ranger, you just steal valor.
Unlike the draft dodging coward Trump!

Shorter Clarke: Happy Father's Day except for the men who died in my prison from maltreatment.
Hopefully your dad isn't EVIL to the core like YOU! #NotMyPresident #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #FRAUD @dvalls1006 @LisaBornfree247
Don't be sad.
But @realDonaldTrump dodged the draft because his daddy bought him bone spurs.
You celebrate #FathersDay by kissing Donald's ring? You will not be rewarded for your loyalty pledge. Give it up
Thank God you didn't take the job. Best Father's day present ever!
Fools. You fought for freedom while 45 is having every freedom taken away. Watch your guns now cowboy! A republican was shot! New gun laws?
Thank you very much to a special Dad who served in Koren!
Houghhrah! Sheriff Clark And DAD! We love you man. Keep up the fight against the corruption and Libertards!

RT @SheriffClarke: Happy Father's "Day" to all dads. My dad. Like father, like son, @realDonaldTrump supporters to the end. He an Airborne‚Ä¶
@realDonaldTrump barely knows his son. Golf > Barron. Poor kid has no father in his life
Like father like son „Äã„Äã„Äã Donald Sr. also a racist .
FTP
He raised a awesome son, tell him thanks and happy father's day
So does he know trump is a draft dodger who says that his military school as a kid was the same as real military boot camp?
Same as Trump, like father like son, prostitution and corruption
Where are all of your shiny medals that mean nothing, Sheriff?
Your father is a hero sir.
Happy Father Day to God first that's every day Happy Fatherdsy to all
You're both illiterate!
