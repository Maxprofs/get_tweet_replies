Buchanan says they haven’t cleared roads to the interior. You are making things up.
Lies from the useless ass in Chief.

BREAKING US Army says 55% of "customers" (1.87m people) on Puerto Rico have no drinking water, up from 44% (1.5m) in the past four days.
General Kelly finally got control of your phone?

Seriously, it’s like you and Kim Jong-Un are in competition to see who’s the craziest. At the moment you’re winning. Be proud
You  definitely proven yourself as a true racist

Texas: We will get through this!
Florida: We will get through this!
Puerto Rico: ".... impossible situation"
Texas: Quick response/aid
Florida: Quick response/aid
Puerto Rico: NO ELECTORAL VOTES="Meh, nothing in it for me. When's tee time?"
This is someone who did a "fantastic job" and you denigrated her. You owe the Mayor of San Juan an apology.
Unfortunately # this guy does not apologize....
Jeff Sessions do his job. We want crimes in government prosecuted. IRS, FAF, Holder, Obama, Clinton, DWS, Lynch, etc. We're not asking.
Not enough, these are Americans stuck with nothing, some have and will die! Step it up, pretend it's your country club!
NFL coverage now on Fox & (1 CRAZY) Friend.
EXPECT  INSANE TWEET STORM!
FANS SHOWING UP TO GAMES in SUPPORT of NFL!
Hey #BenedictDonald, you doth protest2much.Stop trying2pat yourself on the back 20 times a day.It only demonstrates consciousness of guilt.
Time for you to admit that this woman is a wonderful leader and not an object for your abuse and criticism!  Apology please!
Again, what the hell world are you living in. These people need more help. Stop trying to use our first responders to cover your failures
Thanks to the mayor's as well ...you lookin for praise I see
You as president of the United States are a shame, GARBAGE of being human. The Americans and the world are ashamed. Prejudiced. #Respect
I haven't read or heard any criticism of the first responders including FEMA. Only you and your foot dragging and your juvenile attitude.

Well maybe you need to take a page out of their playbook, coz you  suck
Fantastic Job to San Juan's Mayor as well!
I love how Trump refuses to admit that San Juan's Mayor is exactly what a true leader should look like.  Deep down, you know Trump yearns to be just like her!
The wonderful work of Mel Bochner!

PRAVDA style FAKE NEWS emanates from the White House
office trump.  Leave the NFL alone t. and for once do something to make Amer. Great Again!
If you put as much work into #PuertoRicoCrisis as you do tweeting, people wouldn't give U so much shit. All you do is talk. #NotMyPresident
This didn't age well
You are insane
I love that you can let the left & their "crap" roll off of you & focus on the job at hand,they can't rattle you & it makes them crazy.
Your lie to truth ratio is so high, no one believes anything you say. I'll take the word of mayor on ground over fat man on golf course.
While you....play golf...after a little lay in I see...

but no thanks to those lazy PR's right trump?
You're like an insect. Ur incapable of compassion & understanding. And you Church Mouse @SpeakerRyan We STILL see u in the corner.
CHURCH MOUSE: You created the environment for this insanity to flourish. We "see" you and history will REALLY "see" you.
The Left & their FakeNews have done everything in their power to slander, subvert & ostracize President Trump. Still he stands resolute!
Like what? Being on the ground in Puerto Rico, showing LIVE FOOTAGE of the situation there for all to see with their own EYES?

.@realDonaldTrump's Trump's Prophetic Tweet is a Reminder of Things he Promised to do Better. Call him out: RT if you agree. #PuertoRico 
Stop with the governor praise, he's the only one not blasting you for the horrific job you're doing
   
Why do you demand praise?  Just do the best, listen to those on the ground and to hell w/ your ratings obsession. These are lives at stake.
They are doing a fantastic job. The problem is that it could've been done a week ago
I am the first to commend the people helping in Puerto Rico. I'm also the first to criticize your attack on those helping
I think you have to decide between being president and tweeting. I say you just stick with tweeting
How about giving up both?
I would hope we would be lucky enough for that

You have no idea what you have done. You have turn this PR tragedy . into how people look at you. Its not a pretty picture. You don't kick people when their down. I feel we put a bully in the White House.
For your own safety, stay away from the San Juan Mayor.  You screwed with the WRONG lady.  She no longer likes you!  Your fault!
I agree. Better take extra extra detail. Lol. Puerto Rican smile in ur face and stab u in the back with a smile. We petty like that.  #PR
No.  Not petty.  Just honest with an eye for an eye ethic that I admire.

Be careful with #CommunustCarmen. She is in Pocahontas and Crazy Bernies pocket. She would set up liberal media sting operation.
Meanwhile, back here in the real world, Int'l Aid has had to step in because of Trump's priority on golfing.
Please keep in mind, Mr President, people in stress can sometimes seem desperate & ungrateful, they still need love

#IMPEACHtrump
The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina. There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.
They live on a tropic island, was wondering if they could build tepees along the beach like the Native American Indians till they rebuild.
What did you do this weekend besides blow up twitter? I mean with you own hands. What groups did you bring closer together vs divide? Lead!
Even the mayor lost her home but still tries to help with no help from you. Send help instead of rude boorish attacks
Mayor of P.R is a piece of Shit
Praising those making every effort when you've done nothing to help your own citizens? You are a sorry excuse for a "president".
I want my damn help
A ships horn is always loudest in the fog
You did good President Trump. Democrat's greed is stopping the piles of supplies from getting through. CRIMINAL!
You are Exclamation Point Man!! LOL
Hey look, she is still more popular than you!
Don’t let anyone make you feel alone. We are with you and Puerto Rico. https://twitter.com/carmenyulincruz/status/914103908422881280 …
Great Job President Trump, for all movie stars laying blame, you are millionaires you do something, instead of bitching ,
We're going to visit PR as soon as you to with the people who need help and help the economic in the island.
@MargaretCrowth1 @janbhess He left out Mayor Carmen who is fighting to get resources/help for her constituents.
What about Brownie?! Is he doing a great job, too?
Yep, in case you haven't noticed, The #MayorOfSanJuan has a skyrocket high approval rating, while ur's remain in LOW 30's
1/2You're insecurities are on display for the world to see. The Mayor of PR showed the world what strength,power,and a Leader do in crisis..
You showed the world that you are an old, feeble, mentally challenged,impotent,powerless, unfit fool, and half man.
The Mayor saved lives. She did what it took to save her people. While she was saving lives, you hid in your beach house.
Takes a closer look...a deeper understanding...ya know???
I'll believe you know shit about Puerto Rico once you go there.
Got that right Mr. President we have the best first responders in the world
don't give any money to P.R. they will piss it away. give it only to @fema
#resign
Presidents rise above petty insults Mr. President.  You need to consider the conditions the Mayor has been working under.

Priceless...
Biggest Screw up yet and Orange Man has had a Lot!
Thank you madam President! @HillaryClinton This is how a TRUE president woukd respond. #ImWithHerStill #ImpeachTrump
PR doesn't seem to appreciate it.

2: the mayor of SJ is living on a cot and wading in water to deliver supplies (photographic proof, not fake news) while you remain useless.

Have you been?
It's sad that the mayor couldn't even coordinate a few trucks to pick up supplies.
Puerto Rico is an Island surrounded by water, big water, ocean water! It is huuuuge believe me! We have to build a wall to keep water out!!
To all Citizens , if you have not yet . Watch the Nixon tapes, this is just a copycat . Even the same golden drapes in the Oval
President Trump you did s great job getting all the resources needed to PR  now they need to get the supplies to their people great job
We know our Government is doing a good job and Mr. President, you know the left is going to lie about it. Do your thing!!
Wait a minute.....Yesterday you said they expect us to do all the work
Great job our USA people are doing and our President
Trump,  we're all happy that you visited Puerto Rico.  Let's hope supplies start going to those whose needs are urgent.  Also, Trumpet
@CarmenYulinCruz she has done an amazing job.
Thanks especially to the mayor of Puerto Rico, Carmen Yulín Cruz, for your fantastic response and all your hard work!

A little late sir
You're doing an unprecedented job with all the recent disasters.  #Impressed
Lies ppl in PR still don't have support. People are dying. Any death after Maria, is a death u r responsible 4 bc of the lack of leadership
Where's the US Govt emergency procurement order to construct 3 new co-geneation natural gas/solar pwr plants, pwr grid & lines?....
... as many Hispanics as possible, you aren't fooling any1 but urself & racist grps u support, your no bette than Hitler at this point
You should be soooooo happpy....you finally after all this time got your wall..between you and Puerto Rico
Good job my http://ass.you  really think the world is falling for your crap
Monster!
Vote this Democrat out Carmen Yulin..she's jeopardizing Puerto Ricans lives, for not giving away food-water that USA sent.
So where can the Puerto Ricans go to see you "live" when you visit?
The mans grasp on reality is scary.
Hi my name is Patricia and I'm from a place surrounded by water a lot of water,ocean water !! 
PATHETIC IMPOTENT DISPLAY BY AN IGNORANT, DISGUSTING POTUS. P.R. NEEDS MORE $$, GOODS, MANPOWER - LIVES ARE AT STAKE- THEY'RE ON YOUR HANDS
How about a 'thanks' for Mayor Cruz?
I wish I could say the same for my president.


GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT, GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS , PUERTO RICO, AND GOD BLESS OUR GREAT COUNTRY
You thank him until he say something you don't like, then he'll be the worst governor ever. Pathetic!!!!!

WE LOVE PUERTO RICO and believe me Me President PUERTO RICO LOVES YOU AS WELL. The ones who truly see how you have been helping PR
Truly thank you for your help.  God bless you
Wouldn't be ironic if your bungling led to flipping Florida to hard blue?
Nothing we can do, well, at least D Trump has a real heart of gold and at the end of the day I TRUST HIS JUDGEMENT. God Bless.
