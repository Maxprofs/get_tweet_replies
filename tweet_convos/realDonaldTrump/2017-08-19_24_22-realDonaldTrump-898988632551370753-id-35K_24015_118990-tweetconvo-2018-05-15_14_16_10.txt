Great job by all law enforcement officers and Boston Mayor @Marty_Walsh.

The Whitehouse now attends funerals, something not seen for a few years before President Trumps winning election
Is your statement some sort of joke? Have you been under a rock for over 8 years?
Have I been under a rock? No I have not been under a rock, and if Bama goes to a military funeral he's going in the hole
Seriously?  You're threatening President Obama?
He was elected President - TWICE - by the majority of Americans.
Wait, did you just call Boston PD Nazis?!
Turn off FoxNews and work on your resignation tweet.
Don't forget to blame both sides for everything Donnie. It's your new trademark
Resign!
That's what separates their looks from yours!
Were you there? We did t see you. We're there spies of yours there? Nothing in news. Come from your head?
Spreading false news on your official Twitter now?
get out of my country
You're horrible. Go! Do it now!


Thats what they do!! Shows how the left is

The peaceful resistance crowd was bigger than the crowd at your inauguration.
this is all because of you. America hates you, #Donthecon. But we won't stand for hating each other.  Die in prison.
Hey Trump Republiklan. It was a #MAGAT they arrested, not Antifa. Illegally carrying a gun.
#TooLittleTooLate
And here's our Narcissist in Chief attacking anti-Nazi protesters again.
Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.
There were like 5.
You are in my prayers, we need to rescue and save our country! #MAGA
A peaceful protest, you #liar. #ImpeachTrump #firegorka #firemiller
Fight off the Commies!
Thankful we have the police force to protect us from the violent Communists!
Look again
There was no police agitators. There were over 15,000 counter protesting hate groups. Your white supremacist friends were 40 strong. 1/2
How many? Because we know you don't tweet without knowing all of the facts.
Wait do you have all the facts already??
Thank you for supporting the police, Mr. President!
Are you going to write your resignation or are you going to tweet it? Asking for the majority of Americans.
Thankfully the Boston police were smart by keeping both sides separated the best they could. Feel for the elderly lady dragged w/ her flag.
Sounds like complete fabrication as per usual Don Jon


No they are Anti- Nazi protestors. You know...the fine Nazis you adore.
Another proof that anytime  trump speaks he lies. 40,000 ppl in Boston - protested anti white supermacists and trump nazis nor anti-police
Once again, you're deliberately pitting Americans against each other. You know that you can't govern a united country, only a divided one...
Another day, another Trump lie. The protests were 99.9% peaceful, with only a handful of agitators per Boston PD. Stop trying to sow dissent
Also, what happened to your having to wait two to three days for the facts? Do only neo-Nazis deserve a chance for the facts to come in?
What takes you so long to denounce genocidal communists? 7M killed in concentration camps in Ukraine, 10s of millions total.
Communists? Wtf are you talking about? All you people can do is change the subject, because you support the indefensible.
I'm talking about Antifa, an SA Brownshirt-like political violence group supporting communism that attacks peaceful average demonstrators.
When contracts, reason, and ethics fail, Nazis will be chased out with sticks.
Take a hike, Nazi sympathizer.

This would explain why so many #Antifa members had no problem joining the SA Brownshirts. They're the same. http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hitler-and-the-socialist-dream-1186455.html …
Nice! I can quote spurious stuff about Antifa, too. Check it out: https://harrisburg100.blog/2017/06/13/antifa-to-burn-flag-and-desecrate-graves-in-gettysburg/ … Fun!
Trump describes antifascist protesters resisting white supremacists as "anti-police agitators," applauds the cops
Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.
Far-right white supremacists at Boston hate rally outnumbered 10 to 1 by antifascist, antiracist counter-protesters
At least 40,000 antiracist protesters exponentially outnumbered the dozens of white supremacists rallying in Boston
25th Amendment Now
You label people as anti police agitators with no basis - which creates an us vs them debate. Then tweet about unity. Get an fn clue.
Weren't anti-police they were anti-TRUMP!

The greatest solar eclipse in the history of eclipses will happen tomorrow. Donald, can you promise to stare at sun and tweet all about it??
Rough em up, don't be nice, throw them in the back of vans, right POTUS? You said so. Hope U, Ivanka & the boys rcv the same when arrested
you divisive grifter.
Und sie sind ein Trottel
You know you can block some of these haters on here that are so obsessed with you. Trump all the way. 
Unn . President what about new york police department there deserve a thanks to 
Virginia needs to learn from them!!  Great job;;;
@FBI @NewYorkFBI @FBIHouston @FBIPhoenix @fbipatrol @FBIWFO @FBICyberSafety @FBIDallas @FBIRecordsVault @FBIKansasCity #TheResistance
what about the facts, oh wait that only applies to nazi's, see how this works? You and @GOP will never live this down. IT will haunt you.
This sounds like an endorsement of the police state..... just saying. This is bad PR just like everything Trump does
#FakePresident
It was your supporters who carried illegal guns to the rally, you clown.
We are at war!
Cops can not fight this war! 
No way!!!!!  
God Bless them and keep them safe!!!!!
Bring out the national guard with an attitude!
The Boston mayor & police chief's smart & firm action show the failure Charlottesville mayor  police chief due to their political agenda.
Who are the "anti-police agitators" exactly? I watched the entire protest & never saw anything anti-police. I'm sure you mean the "alt-left"
Wrong again!  You just want to incite violence!!! For your own purposes.  Resign !!!
Well the cat's out of the bag now...anti-police agitators aka police vibrators
General Kelly do something !!!
Not true according to Boston Police Commissioner & the Boston mayor.
So get on this save the world sire
The biggest agitator lives in the WT, look in the mirror Donald!
That means that 100% of Bostonians didn't carry a gun on them to the rally. (I'll also bet that this guy voted for you too, b/c upstate NY!)
You missed the verb Mr. President.
You are NOT a defender of democracy for the PEOPLE! You & #Nazi friends fear what we can do! #NaziSympathizer #RacistTrump #ImpeachTrump
Do you ever get these situations correct? Should someone who is so confused so often really be the leader of the free world?
#WeLovePresidentTrump
If they're so tough and smart, why do they vacate the premises when deranged white supremacists are involved. #TrumpTrulyIsADerangedImbecile
One day you too shall look tough and smart till then you remain the spineless jelly fish you are kick rocks with open toe sandals , D-bag
Anything u say can n will be used against u. We think u r doing a great job. Please don't respond to social issues!  
Anti-police agitators are losers. Same as the loser that disrepects our President of The USA.
May God Give President Trump Peace of Mind. Thank you President Trump. The majority has your back. 
Mr. Trump you need to cut the head off the snake take out George sorrows if this shit continues the working class silent majority will do it
Love the haters, make America GREAT again!
They handled the crowd well
Those were not anti-police agitators, you weirdo. They were counter-protesters to the #WhiteSupremacists. #ResignTrump #TheResistance
You really are out of touch with reality
Guess you might have (OR NOT) realized that they were NOT anti-police agitators by now. I thought you checked your shit out b4 you commented
I think they were anti nazis
JUSTICE FOR HEATHER - CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP,ALT RIGHT, KKK & WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS 

PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS!
Of all the asinine tweets you've made, this one takes the case. Were you trying to incite a riot? @realDonaldTrump
Your no hero, your nothing but a brief stain on American history, you will be gone soon and everything you undid will be resurrected.
#TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign
By anti police U mean against racism & hate? Why is it the president has such a hard time denouncing racism and the alt right? U need them!

#GRANTTHEMARTINEZTWINSTHEIRVISA @realDonaldTrump
Why should the police look 'tough and smart'?
If you're worried about China, fuck them their men are as tall as our women and not nearly as mean
Hi Punkin
anti-police agitators ... zero evidence, demonstrably false
@PacoFran7 Save us D. Separatists make UP wall in CAT there wall in Vasc ok
Will police disclose names of "Antifa" rioters? Seems police did nothing in Berkley assault on conservatives.
Shut up.
I imagine the nation's police are getting tired of your inciting protests they have to police. Most would also say there are no good nazis.
you are an insult to human intelligence @realDonaldTrump 
2 Rep Party. Leaks on confident. treaty occurred. Politicins paid protstors to ensue riots. Thousands of Protestors a day threatened 2 pull

There it is. "Agitators!" His old guard can identify with that term. MLK, Malcolm, Medgar Ever were all called agitators.
A few dozen neo nazis et al and 40,000 anti racist resisters. Yes.
You are creating fake news. As usual you disregarded all the facts
Sheesh, could you cool it with twitter?  My president is the weird, awkward uncle we make excuses for
...says the twitterer...
You are right, lol... although it did take me a few months to notice anyone had responded to me
Not agitators. Those are your base!  They are doing it because you allow it and support them doing it.
And I am truly thankful we finally got a president that knows how to save our country!
Start looking into activities by George Soros, and others like him Then maybe your agenda will proceed unhindered Mr. President.
Amazingly the police commissioner and mayor loved the protesters said that they didn't want your Nazi friends there
I pray for our police
Trying to create fake news again? #Resign
Looks like McMaster is now our president

Looks like 40,000 people who turned out against bigotry might show the world we are not a racist country despite our temporary president
Hi
NYPD and BP toughest around will never lose control
First thing he does is to stir the pot with "police-agitator" rhetoric. Then his aides take over his twtter account.........
Tough & smart.. what a combo....
Um no
You defend Nazis. Resign.
@DonnaSerpentini Really?  How do they usually look??
who are the agitators?The people fighting hate and bigotry who say that their lives matter?Anti police violence not police
Not anti police.  Anti white supremacists, Donny John.  As you should be.  Love police. Dislike Nazis.
Last time we heard the word "agitator" used in protests, it was in reference to Martin Luther King Jr. and other Civil Rights Activists....
https://twitter.com/lionelverney/status/898761323571363840 …

Yes thank the police for protecting literal Nazis. So American of you!
@USArmy @GoArmyWestPoint @ArmyWP_Football @ArmyWP_WBB @ArmyWP_Baseball @ArmyWP_Hockey @ArmyWP_MLax @USNavy @us_navyseals @NavyExchange
Trumps Bigot Agitators!
What alternate universe do you live in, Cheetoman??
Stop tweeting, please. You are the President of the United States 
GOD BLESS & GOOD LUCK TO OUR MEN IN BLUE. IF EVER WE NEEDED LAW & ORDER, IT IS NOW! SO MANY HAVE DIED. MAKE LAWLESS ACCOUNTABLE! AT TOP 1ST!
But you need to investigate the agencies financed by SOROS that arm and pay them.
Why must you agitate?  And why lie?  You lie and you lie and you lie.
A couple idiots.
You are the worst President ever!!
This has NOTHING to do with the police or their bigoted behavior in places like, lets say Ohio for just ONE example
@Browns @Bengals @nyjets @RamsNFL @Colts @tigers @Redskins @Jaguars @Titans @TBBuccaneers @Ravens @Chargers @Titan @Saints @Cardinals
Looks like you have no clue whats going on as usual.

"anti police killing innocent people of color"  #ftfy #resist #impeach #blm
No anti-police. Just anti-hate. And anti-YOU.
People should not allowed to protest with face coverings!
gros con
Well, sure, aren't you sympathetic to right wing activities?  #1927 #andimnottalkingyankees
