FALSE FLAG?
Speaks volumes trump would rather retweet then condemn racist groups like the alt right, nazism and kkk
Need an investigation to see why the local government shut down free speech also.
What does that mean r u going to open up an investigation into the BLM and antifa attackers yesterday too?
You mean when a white supremacist neonazi Trump supporter TERRORIST murdered one American and injured 19 others?

Who else thinks its time for a NATIONWIDE #ImpeachTrumpMarch #AntiTrumpMarch?  
#Charlottesviille #TheResistance

And let's add BLM, antifa and Black Panthers to the list to keep it fair.
Cuz he doesn't want to offend any of his Bridesmaids
Time to #FireBannonMillerGorka if @realDonaldTrump wants to be a POTUS who is Not a laughing stock and footnote to history! #TaxReturns
Too late. He's been a laughing stock since November 8
He is more respected around the world then Obama ever was.
So Jon... When was the last time you left the bad old US of A on a fact finding mission for this doozy of a conclusion? 
Cause as a Scot, now living in Australia, you must forgive me when i assume you have just shot up smack into your eyeball......
Just learned I'm more Scottish than I thought. Now I know where our since of humor comes from. 
You attacked Dems for not "Naming the Enemy" and saying "Radical Islamic Terrorism.
Yet, He refused to Name the Enemy.

The world is watching Dear Leader Don
...Aaannd Don still can't bring himself to say anything more. Just as well, The less said from him the better. Nightmare. #Charolettesville
What investigation? On yourself! You are responsible! These are your people! You with all your racists crap did this! U might as well drove
Donald Trump should be investigated  for murder! He should be impeached
@realDonaldTrump Here's VA Gov. Terry McAuliffe, showing true leadership where you showed none!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv7efvsUdyw …
Glad you congratulated yourself before posting this, coward.
Say it. RADICAL WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM. Why can't the president say it? Is he afraid?
the gov has failed to protect the people from lib terrorists so they will protect themselves.
Don't worry, Trump. The AMERICAN PEOPLE r taking care of domestic terrorism from the KKK and Neo-Nazis. U r next, Trump. We know u r a -
- white supremacist too. U cheap attempts to score political points has failed - again.
What about ALL the violence that day? Hello Soros!
@realDonaldTrump here's how a leader responds.

As a concerned citizen of this country I beg President Trump to enact marshal law in America to stop people from inciting protests now !!
Cream filled Frosted Snowflake
Lol
Against the president's better judgement.  President says, "It's cool, just my peeps being my peeps!"
The DOJ is opening a civil rights investigation on the car attack in Charlottesville https://www.axios.com/doj-is-investigating-charlottesville-2472486797.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic …
open up one for ANTIFA TOO!
@realDonaldTrump Hope they unmask the phony-POTUS as an actual Nazi sympathizer and closet Fuhrer.
Psalm 20:4
May He #grant you according to your #heart’s #desire, And fulfill all your #purpose.
I think it's disgusting how little you care about what happened. Ur too concerned about what other countries think of you when we need help
With regard to your dear follower?  Hope so. About time.
I'm in total shock that you've retweeted this, but let's take it further and STRONGLY CONDEMN white supremacy, and racism in all its forms.
Hahahhaha the anti-Trump trolls dont have much to say. Your President is making America great again!!!
The left gets away this over and over ! I don't agree with violence but left has set this up
I sure as hell hope they include Antifa & BLM in their investigation as well as their FUNDING!!!
Honest question. Since when has it become wrong to denounce Nazis??
Why all the deflection to other groups?
Nazis are responsible!

You are so weak. Say it Donald.
I denounce hate groups in this great country of diversity.
Say it Donald, what make America great is love!
I'm running against Maxine Waters
You will lose
Wonder who the Nazi leader is? hmmm?
Still no National Address Condemning #WhiteSupremacists #NeoNazis or your Supporter #DavidDuke #FireBannonMillerGorka #BringBackObama
He doesn't care about Americans this was a way to enrich himself.

The White supremacy group had a legal permit issued.  ANTIFA was bussed in to cause trouble as usual.  Police did NOT intervene.  Shameful.
Let's agree not to allow Nazis to march on our streets. Their ultimate goal is murder.
Wrong. Our Constitution allows for ALL voices to be heard without violence. You profess views that Stalin would endorse.
Our constitution was ripped to shreds with Obamas backhanded Iran deal, his pushing through health care for dummies and who knows what else.
I agree with you on that point.
You get a .

That's OK, I'll have yours
As long as its not dem led!!!
The news is focusing on the KuKluxKlan an Nazi's.It is the counter protesters causing all the problems,they always do @realDonaldTrump.2016.
So I guess we should ignore the young woman killed by the Neo Nazi and the fact the came with riot gear and mace 'cause they WANTED a fight
She was there blocking traffic and beating on cars.A terrorizer. @realDonaldTrump.2016.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?! what about the others he hit. Were they also blocking traffic on prupose how can you even say that

They were all terrorizing. @realDonaldTrump.2016.
they were protesting because the KKK a terrorist organization was there and they were fighting for my rights
The kkk is Christian now.Your demonic animalistic left wingers have been causing all the problems for months.KKK was fighting for my rights.
Your right to terrorize people of color? They aren't Christian. Because to be christian is to love. There is no love in the KKK
Herr Trumpf won't even condemn the white supremacist haters that caused all this. He won't even honor Heather Heyer by using her name. 
STOP IT. No Spin, No Distractions, this was MURDER by a hate fueled white supremacist. If you defend then you agree & are complicit.
I have constantly condemned RACISM, MISOGYNY, XENOPHOBIA, ANTISEMITISM and most types of hate. I will NOT condemn patriotic RESISTANCE.
Stephen Miller, well known for racism his whole life.
Is DOJ opening any civil rights investigations of blm attacks on innocent white people? ?
A guy got behind the wheel of a car and drove it into a crowd of people while being video'd. What's to investigate, prosecute the driver.
They want to know if it was a conspiracy.
Perhaps it is a conspiracy. Maybe the guy was actually Antifa and was trying to cause lots of problems for white folks. Not every white ...
That's why they're investigating.
...I disagree with the other groups on most things. They were permitted.  Cops diverted permitted group into the path of counter protesters
Right
He should also research why all was peaceful till Antifada showed up.
People who use Antifa in conversation:
- Fascists

End of list.

This was in response to the fuck antifa guy not the beauty of Richard Spencer getting punched
DOJ investigation on car attack is easy pickings
What the DOJ won't jump on is the malice of state &local gov played off

You did this.. .@realDonaldTrump you can resign or wait and be #Impeached.. what you can't do is change this legacy..
Sessions investigating civil rights is as comforting as trump and putin monitoring election hacking.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump they need to make priority and get info out quickly
Why is no one mentioning ANTIFA?
Why? They didn't open a civil rights investigation for the Boston bombing,or when the gay liberal shot other gay liberals in miami!
The 3 deaths are on U! Murder of 3 becz U promote violence hate/racism.Why not be Pres of KKK & let honest person B Pres USA?  68% agree.GO!
You want Cuba to send Assata Shakur back to the US. but David Duke and Richard Spencer, James Fields are right here.  LOCK THEM UP!
You mean where he was being attacked with baseball bats?
I agree and the cops where told to stand down. Why and by who?
What about the black live matter and antifia that was there?This was a peaceful protest until they showed up! Not right to leave them out!
Car attack? Call it what it is. It was a terrorist attack!!
This was a terrorist attack using ISIS tactics. Nothing more nothing less. Not just a car attack.
No such thing when the driver was being attacked with baseball bats
Thank you for saying there was violence on all sides. Not all the "white" people who were there for the rally were white supremacists.
I believe most libs live off us hard working tax payers
I hope theyr also going to investigate who gave the police the stand-down order! Was it the Mayor or Governor. They shld be held responsible
Soros & Globalist Deep State created VA violence, a la Ukraine, to begin removal of POTUS. See @USNJack's thread https://mobile.twitter.com/USNJack/status/896813052783362048 …
Really...
Where is the investigation on this as a terrorist act and a hate crime?
After hearing Sessions' despicable statement, I have no faith that any of you will do the right thing. You are all unfit to govern.
Yes, #CowardTrump send these terrorists to Gitmo. Wait, they're the reason you're President. #DamnedOurNation #MAGA #TheResistance
Why won't you explicitly condemn Nazis and white nationalists?
Pay attention,Don. That's people doing their job. Try it sometime.
We need answers who paid for these people to be here? Who paid for the signs? There is corruption behind #Charlottesville
Think the word is politicians, same as corruption though.

Your response appaled people.  Obama's was appreciated
Well done being SHAMED into condemning racism in the U.S. You're such a dummy.
Civil rights?  This is an act of terrorism.
Good. I hope they also investigate who funded the hateful, violent counter-protesters (who came to create violence) & charge them as well.
Please POTUS fund defense against Radical White Terrorists.
You're the cause
Finally they are investigation Humpty Trumpty's deplorable terrorist base of supporters.  They need to be outlawed and locked up with 45!!!
Trump strongly condemns WS: "Of course that includes white supremacists...". Very very strong. Strongliest in the world.
Your nationalist HATE campaign rhetoric fueled this. This is on you.
Sessions, What about an investigation into all the Clinton BS? Are you afraid of the dems?
Look into vice mayor, mayor and Governor,  collusion
This is the only tRump tweet I have and will like until his resignation tweet.
How about one man committing murder. Both sides under our constitution have the right to the freedom of expression. Not murder
And you didn't request it, and you had nothing to do with it, Trump.
The president has served as“megaphone”for far-right ideas, and has energized a whole wave of young people. many new to the right-wing cause.
Not sure why Trump retweeted this. We already know that Trump and Sessions will sideline this as quickly as possible. It distracts from NK.
The direct responsibility for this clashes to Charlottesville Virginia Police Department the mayor and the ACLU
Duh... Ya think !
pay attention! You all have to watch this! Charlottesville was a set up to start a revolution...by who? The CIA. https://www.pscp.tv/w/1MnGnmyXagkKO .
Another investigation for your Admin?
Sigh... just a RT. Guessing that's all Trump could muster up.
Was not a 'CAR' attack!  It was a DOMESTIC TERRORIST Attack!  Trumps Home Grown Terrorist Base murdering our own citizens on our own soil!
How about the unprovoked smashing of the taillight by anti fa with a bat?
How can a Justice Department headed by Sessions actually investigate this American tragedy ! ! ! ? ? ?
Simple.
You stated that you would pay legal fees for anyone to assault protesters during your campaign. You facilitated the attack in VA.
This is a crime against humanity.
Hopefully they will also investigate the role ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter, Local and State Democrat Politicians role in the Policing Failure.
Why a civil rights violation, and not domestic terrorism?
Mayor of Charlottesville should be charged with Obstruction of Justice.  Permitted 1 st amendment protestors should of been protected!
The original permitted protesters were denied there freedom of speech by the town and threaten & attacked by left wing  liberal communist.

#SundayFunday #TeenChoice
What really happened in #Charlottesville: Communist agitators forced white nationalists to run violent gauntlet 
YOU CAN GET RID OF YOUR DOJ THEY WERE HIRED BY YOU SO THEIR WORD MEANS AS MUCH AS YOURS "NOTHING"
@TheJusticeDept Go AG Sessions Go!
Is this the same Civil Rights division you tasked last week to fight for white rights against affirmative action? Excuse my skepticism.
DOJ- Nazi loving man slams into crowd,killing 1 injuring many.

Trump- Its an accident.Violence on both sides. Case closed.What's 4 lunch?
Lets see what Nationalist Sessions does under Nationalist President Trump and Nationalist Bannon and Nationalist Miller!  Got 2 C this!
Good .. because I think we are not getting the whole story! #Charlottesville
Yep
They need to investigate. But the truth needs to be out. What happened & how. Media is putting out lies as usual. Fox has joined the others
Need to investigate who backed all this and ALLOWED the violence.  This all seems to be staged and everyone has a script they are following.

For who's side?
The Constitution was designed to protect all individuals Equally! To persecute a group or state by destroying Heritage attacks the Church !
Open a civil rights investigation into the other protest groups there, such as violent Antifa, BLM, etc. Ok???
It was a terrorist attack. Use the words! Call it what it is!
the car accident was & will be found to be just a single individuals act of stupid courage; unplanned & created in the heat of the moment.

With Ol' Beauregard at the helm, there isn't much confidence that this investigation will be expedient or effective!
Blame all on http://alt-right.You  ACTUALLYcan be wrong!Your loyalties are all for DDuke/KKK/neoNazis.YOU promote domestic terrorism. 

What they aren't telling you about Charlottesville. 

Via .@infowars

Happy poland
Investigate the damn mayor for calling off the police and leaving people vulnerable to attack!
@realDonaldTrump agreed.
Just another waste of my taxes. Lawyer buddies given handouts at the tax payer trough. Just so many ponies.
Should the @TheJusticeDept  investigate the financing behind major protests?  #Charlottesville

How many cops were killed in the last yr per g
Blm mantra "pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon"?
Don't be a sucker - 1947! #democracy #politics #MSNBC #CNN #NYtimes
Trump has empowered alt right groups since he ran for president. Their representatives are in the WH! When will Republicans have enough?
Certainly qualifies as a hate crime.
I hope that young girl’s parents personally sue Donald Trump.
Sessions will get the BOTTOM of why all those counter-protesters blocked the car driver's rights to plow into pedestrians!
The blood of the victims are on trump's hands.
Same day at Soros birthday! Things that make you go Hmmm

Statement on @realDonaldTrump's Charlottesville speech from "The Daily Stormer" - A leading American neo-Nazi website: 
that was a Antifa.  group driving the car and running over Antifa supporters.  that terrist hate group is on heavy drugs
President Trump's comments have been very good. Mr. President thank you for speaking the truth.
They need to investigate the VA Governor and State Police.
VA Gov. Terry McAuliffe REFUSES to Condemn Leftist Violence http://truthfeed.com/va-gov-terry-mcauliffe-refuses-to-condemn-leftist-violence/100735/ … via @@truthfeednews

THAT IS ONLY IS START!!  Let see where you go Trump and Sessions!!
Car attack or driver scared shitless from being beaten to death? #antiwhite #WhiteGeNocide
You think this was a justified murder, then?
It wouldn't be murder if it was involuntary sweetheart. Think McFly! Think! #antiwhite
Either way, you think this was justified?
Lol, you must be anti-White because only an anti-White could be so stupid.
Its interesting how you aren't able to say that you think it is or is not justified. Why is that? Are you worried it sound bad?
You make no sense. Is WHAT justified? Being scared???
You are  #CowardlyTrump U can only retweet because U are too afraid of your 36% base. One term for you, if that. #ImpeachTrump #Impeach45
Apoarently our President condones the hate
Nice retweet puppet but you didn't have anything to do with this.

You mean domestic terrorism?
Sessions, a civil rights hater, is opening a civil rights an investigation.  Sessions is a white nationalist he hates POC. Unfunny joke!
It will yield nothing because it wasnt a conservative that sunk to such depravity!
Will they be investigating "many sides"?
VIRGINIA has never stopped fighting the CIVIL WAR!!!
@realDonaldTrump owns it. As long as he has white supremacists in the WH, he has no credibility.
Investigate the driver beingnbeat up and chased prior to driving into crowd. Arrest those beating and attacking him first.
No thatnks to your insistence. So stop trying to step up and take the credit now. Pathetic. As usual... #allfartnoshit
So by retweeting this, what do you have to say about it?
Why doesn't the DOJ open investigation of the other racist hate group Antifa fascists.
Ok. But what's going on with the Hillary & Obama investigations.
