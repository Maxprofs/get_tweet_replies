R Maddow tonight said ship only treating 7 patients now when it can handle thousands.
Seems people who need that help are having difficulty getting to the ship.Wonder why that is.Stop brown nosing 45 and see that they get help
Only a week late and several dozen dead bodies ago. Nicely done, Crapfest! #PuertoRico #kakistocracy

About fucking time

Right on time....  If the hurricane hit a week later.
#WorstPresidentEver
how many days prior was Royal Caribbean there?  what took so long for #USNSComfort to be deployed?  http://miami.cbslocal.com/2017/10/03/royal-caribbeans-rescue-mission-to-puerto-rico-us-virgin-islands/ … #MAGA #MAGABot

Se inda tiñades dúbidas, desengañádevos: Rajoy e o seu PP son os nazis de arestora #CatalunyaVota 
Yes  2020  I am praying for Puerto Rico in amen
Meanwhile in Las Vegas there was a mass shooting and president Trump will be attending services for the people that were shot in Las Vegas.
Look nice guys in your diplomatic whites,,,not getting down to work attire,you dress like Melania

The Mayor of San Juan, cries with a loaf of bread under each arm ! They make me sick with their lies ! God Bless you !
I lovr you guys of US NAVY  THIS is huge  i love i love & i love you all thanks for your tremedous support for the relief of hurricanes!
@realDonaldTrump WARNING: this bot is malfunctioning.
Carnival cruise lines beat them there. DAYS.
Someone today on Twitter actually thinks Hillary Clinton gave the Navy marching orders to send them.Fake news is working overtime.It's crazy
Hey Donny, why is this only being sent now?
Why did a take a week to dispatch the ship. You knew the hurricane was going to hit days before. Poor planning.
Glad to see the real news. Haven't heard this story on the news.
#FAKENEWS
About fucking time!!!
Are you bragging about sending it 2 weeks too late?
We know what you did and DIDN'T do!
More than 10 days later??? Classic #TrumpArtOfTheDeal: let them suffer and die to force a great deal in paying their debt to #WallStreet
Great job to all those who serve! Know you would have left immediately if Prez had thought to care about people in Cat 5 hurricane.
@realDonaldTrump glad Hillary suggested this 2 weeks ago
Why did it take so long?  The ship should have been sent a lot sooner.  What was the excuse?
你们建造军舰和其他民用船舶都是用中国的龙门吊建造的！！！
These people think logistics is easy. Getting vessels through these uncharted waters. the last thing they need is to run aground.
Why wasting time talking?! Just go
ABOUT TIME.
Shut up #DanScavinoJr ! Get in there to help. Oh wait, is this disrupting your golf caddy duties? STF up unless you're helping. Jeez.
USA taxpayers know that this is a waste of taxpayers money. We demand that all foreign aid be stopped immediately. PR has never helped USA.
Thank you @HillaryClinton for giving presidential order to send U.S.S. Comfort - excellent idea & orders followed.  Keep up the good work!
It's only being sent because Hillary Clinton went on tv and embarassed you
USA Comfort enroute. How many day has it taken. All ICU patients have died. Can't provide life support without diesel generators. But according to Trump it's a "Yuge" success. He hasn't had any family die.
@POTUS don't retweet this like it is your achievement.  This is a little late.  Just like everything you do.  #NotMyPresident #TinyHands
https://libertywriters.com/2017/10/puerto-rican-cop-just-called-radio-station-leak-something-thatll-destroy-san-juan-mayor/ … SHES A DEM LIAR! She needs to be removed. THEY got to her!!!
5 days after this @HillaryClinton tweet #USNSComfort finally was on its way. You're a good caddy Danny. The world needs ditch diggers too.
9 days after the Hurricane... 
And how long did it take you to decide to send them? How many people had to die before you got shamed into sending this ship to help?
How does a golf caddy wind up filing bankruptcy, Dan? Don't need to tell us where you learned your financial tactics.
Which should have been done a week ago!!
Took long enough.
9 days after the storm hit.  This one was a slow response.
Hooray for your help. My heart goes out to the people of PR. Having been through Katrina
Great! Better (10 days) late than never!!
Well it is about effing time. More than a week...a week went by, when they could have been underway,  before @realDonaldTrump got shamed into doing some. The people who have died without medical care, that's on trump.
Thank you Hillary!

Is Scavino still around? I thought Mueller had indicted him.
9 days later. It'll take several more days to arrive. Pray for patients in hospitals, ERs & ICUs to survive that long. RIP those who didn't
Good
They will be busy!
When is the so-called President gonna deliver much-needed Play-Doh to Puerto Rico?  Tell him to get off his fat ass and get to fucking work.
8 days late Dan. We knew they were needed before the hurricane hit. All that was needed was the order from the Rudderless in Chief
Thanks Hillary!
It's about time. #IMPEACHTHEPEACH
Thanks a lot sir, Puerto Rico appreciate you and the president to help people in much need, God bless you, and God bless USA

It is pitiful & laughable when you have to retweet your own Propaganda Guy, uh Social Media Dir. to bolster your monstrous ego.
Hey, nice job, way to economize...if you leave more than a week late, think of all the ppl you don't have to help...they already died. 
10 days and USNS Comfort just getting ready to sail. Not Navy’s fault. Trump delayed order. 

He doesn’t want to help PR. It’s clear.
A little too late !!!

Stolen from Facebook: "Just to be clear, after Hati's earthquake in 2010 President Obama had mobilized thousands in the military and a 1/
I was Offered Army Commission of 2nd Lieutenant when I graduated Nursing School. I would've liked to Serve on #USNSComfort CC'd @ChuckNASCAR
Why you late? People have died
You should have listened to Hillary when she suggested it 8 days ago.
I don't understand why our floating medical hospital was not already on standby after Harvey & Irma. What is 600 billion a year getting us?
PUERTORRIQUENOS NOT HAPPY WITH TRUMP!
“Word is certainly spreading” in PR on Trump’s tweets, @Boris_Sanchez says. “Several people telling me things that I cannot repeat" on TV. 
Enough with the talk -- just get moving!
You know, I delivery trailer loads of chicken about 500 feet left of that white ship at a cold storage facility. That ship is amazing.
How many days has it been?
This is great news. Most of the complainers on here have their keyboard muscles flexing but aren't doing a thing IRL to help PR. Good luck.
Junior, they will get there in 5 days, should have been deployed the day after the hurricane hit. How many will die in 5 days?
omfg - it shoulda been deployed on Day 1 after Maria. NOT USNavy's fault-they rock. It's @realDonaldTrump admin's fault, 100%. #criminal

TEN DAYS AFTER The DISASTER STRUCK!!! Guess they are going to collect the BODIES!!! U KNEW "MARIA" was Class 5 and going to HIT Puerto Rico! https://twitter.com/Scavino45/status/913916405803880448 …
And Trump is doing anything to help PR bullshit his the one sending them there to help tired of the nasty comments from their Mayor
Man, #trumpRegime working so hard on #DamageControl now. Too bad #trump didn’t work this hard, like, THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER THE HURRICANE!

Lol. Yes. What a sensitive #broflake that requires his golf course safe space to tweet from while not doing any actual work. 

Very disturbing that DOJ and Sessions are not taking any action in the IRS scandal. Message to all bureaucrats: Do your worst. #loislerner
You can't change the narrative now. You guys were a day late and a dollar short. You did a crap job and got caught.
About fuc*ing time!
Yea, after Hillary told you to do it days & days ago.  Why didn't you do it to begin with???  Idiots

Mayor .@CarmenYulinCruz is a Joke! You got time Time to make T-shirt’s but claim y’all dying and not getting help #PuertoRicanLivesMatter 
Go Navy! I love our military! God bless you and God’s speed!
after @HillaryClinton suggested it
WTF took so long?
Here comes the Navy !
Yeah, left Port yesterday. Will take 3 days to get there! A day late and a dollar short thanks to Trump!
9 days late!!! We all saw this coming the news reported it and the devastation that was about to unfold. That is the issue.
About time. Good thing @HillaryClinton mentioned it or you idiots wouldn't have even known it existed. Trump Administration? What a joke
Take @RepDonBeyer he seems to have a lot to say in how things are being run. I’m sure a used car salesman can tell the military how its done
Enroute!? By now it should be "en helping people for days."
GOOD
About time.
@realDonaldTrump  It just got orders to set sail??? Little late how many days after PR devastated? Jones Act? #ImpeachTrump
When it takes 10 days to decide to send it to begin with,  you are no hero. #TrumpFails
Thank you, Hillarie
About time!
Damned, I am so proud of our Navy!
It is so wonderful seeing what is really happening and not #MSM #Activist #journalism pushes AKA Twisting the Truth 
#FYI @gdegaston
It should have been on stand by in Florida before hand.  Is this a day late and a dollar short Mr. President?
Thank you
What took so long @mention #RCCMCFALL
Be sure to say hello to the mayor of San Juan
Why weren't they zig zagging around Bermuda, waiting out the hurricane...way to pre-prepare...45 needs to let the ADULTS handle the country.
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME YOU DEPLOYED THE COMFORT

HILLARY CLINTON SAID TO DO THAT A WEEK AGO. 

#UNFITtoLEAD
#ImpeachTrump
I've not heard of ANY media outlet owners coughing up money, planes, food, medical supplies etc! All they do is criticize!
A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING! The media should be ashamed of themselves. If they think they can do a better job why aren't they delivering relief?
Better very late then never I guess...... hurricane hit over a week ago....
@realDonaldTrump They were never scheduled until 3 days ago..they said they didnt have those orders and were not prepped!
Too little, too late. Dead Puerto Ricans are on your tRUmp's watch.
#25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow
Why wasn't this Ship Deployed 9 Days Ago ?
About damm time!! #forgottenamericans
better late than never. Your boss is an ass and you enable his disgusting behaviour
@realDonaldTrump EIGHT days later. Thank you, #USNSComfort. Hurry up. #PuertoRico needs you now #unfitpotus #trumprussia #IMPEACH
@realDonaldTrump should have sent a aircraft carrier too
It’s about time.
It only took about two weeks.  Whatevs.  We had the NFL to pick on for some unknown reason, golf to play, boogers to pick, you know . . .
Should have been there on day 1.
Why wasn't the order given to get them on their way earlier?  They were waiting on it.
Only a week late, too. #makeamericashitagain
#TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #trumpsawhitesupremacist #fucktrump #RacistInChief #WhiteNationalist #BIGOT #TrumpRussiaCollusion
You'd think this JUST happened... 

But Trump is upset bc Trump org. Is a creditor following PR's Bnkrpcy of DT branded golf course.
So this is why POTUS is so vocal about Puerto Rico's debt... It directly affected ts him.
s the captain is silent... He could have been enroute already...  Media .. get your shit together and get real.. people die.
don't help the nasty POTUS hating Mayor. They can help themselves too right? You can't be Social Media Director & show compassion.
#thankshillary!
About damn time. You knew Maria was going to leave devastation in her wake why wasn’t it sent before the storm hit?
Hillary Clinton had to go public to insist that the USNS Comfort be sent to aid Puerto Rico.  Trump got on board late for that one. Phony.
And it only took two weeks. Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.
should have been out a week ago but Donnie boy was sooooooooo busy playing golf...go figure
2 weeks late..
America is so sorry that our amazing USN has such a weak commander in chief.  Hopefully he will resign soon.
Better late than never.
Amazing 2 weeks later and you are just NOW en route??? Are we suppose to give you a cookie for that???
After 2 weeks of nothing Hillary Clinton, an uncommon American citizen, had to show Trump how to be presidential.  Resign.
