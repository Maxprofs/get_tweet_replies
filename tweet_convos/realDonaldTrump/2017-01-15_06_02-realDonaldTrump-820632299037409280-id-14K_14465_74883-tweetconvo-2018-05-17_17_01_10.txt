You must have a special alarm that goes off when Prez Trump tweets. That or you just stare at your phone.
It is called a notification. I have a fancy phone that has it pop up. Kind of like when I tweet and you ALWAYS respond.
troll alert , troll alert , troll alert .

Most cars are made here.
You are not a legitimate president.

Do you realize that some Mercedes and BMWs driving around Europe are made in the US? The Auto Industry is a Global Business
Silly @realDonaldTrump rides the coatails of the previous administration and misrepresents the vote. Lost the popular vote by 3Mil. Sad.
But...but....a lot of Libs DON'T WANT jobs. Or to pay back their student loans. Or be told they're not special. Or...

So, the price of cars and other goods go up to compensate for firms' higher costs. No Econ 101 at Wharton, bro?

.@realDonaldTrump Alright, I'm glad you're self soothing. Boy oh boy do I hope you have a financially responsible, longterm plan for this.

It's a wake-up call in #America! How I wish it could happen in #Africa too, especially in #Nigeria.
Rolling back regulations =>pillage Mother  and crony capitalism with trickle down voodoo econ, what can go wrong? #SOTU
Um. I am a registered Independent voter. But you continue alienating voters w your stupidity. Nothing lost on the sour bernquats .

You don't score points for jobs that companies decided to bring back before you even decided to run for President. Moron!
As a matter of fact, those companies attributed their factory investments to Donald Trump. Stop lying cuck
the stock market tripled under obama, more wealth created than any other president
Lol what a load of bullshit. The stock market and economy have been mediocre under Obama.
do the math! More wealth created under obama than ever before
More debt and inflation created under Obama than ever before. More wars in the Middle East
what war did obama start in the middle east? Inflation below target 2 percent, next
Did you know that Barack Obama is the only President in US history to be at war all 8 years?

.@realDonaldTrump Yes. You could even start with your own stuff.
You must be the arithmetic man; you add trouble, subtract pleasure, divide attention, and multiply ignorance.
please do not take credit for 8-years of hard work by a hard worker!  You haven't done anything as you aren't POTUS yet.
Ever since I have seen you in your family tree, I have wanted to cut it down.
stop taking credit for things announced B4 ur "election" ie. Fiat/UAW announced in 15. Sprint in Oct 16. #FactsforTrump

the ONLY way you're gonna bring back the jobs numbers you've said,is by bribing companies,which you WILL do make my words
Con-Don that goes for your products what's good for goose and all that so do it first

Why can't car makers sell directly to the public ?  Could this be changed ?
# What is wrong with you, besides being a liar and one huge bully?

Should stop deals with EU and make deals with each country in split. The only way to ensure a fair trade with Europe.
I’d give you a nasty look but you’ve already got one.

Regards
Do you really think you manage the German car makers this way ,  be a big joke, .... us cars
