Mr. President, I'm struck that no one has mentioned people kneeling during the N.A. @ hockey open after shooting. They didn't
That man is as much a dotard as you!

Paper towel free throw, whee! Seriously, wtf is wrong with you??
Where was Obama . President Trump is the first President that acts like a real man
Thank u for ur help!!

FEMA workers have done a great job indeed!
It's as if you as President is taking credit for the job that FEMA is doing.  You aren't the one carrying supplies.
Where in that tweet did he take credit poor Eddy??? Nowhere. Somebody get Eddy a fresh diaper, he crapped so much that now he is playing in it and yep, he is eating it too!!

Ur bone spurs must have been bugging u as u met San Juan Mayor. U looked terrified. Very brave with tweets, not so much face to face. 
So he kissed the ring.
He won't address the mayor! Damn I prayed you got pushed into the " big,big" water!!

Turned on Jimmy Kimmel's las vegas shooting monologue this morning so my son could see how a real leader would talk about it.

True compassion. 
Why do you need constant praise?
Narcissistic personality disorder
Did he like the trophy?
Did you throw paper towels at him too?
Glad to see you back 
Thankyou for being there for #PuertoRico President Trump

Peace & love in OneNation UnderGod is what & who we stand for

Trump you my nigga mayne.
Evidence Mounts that White House Anticipates Damaging Results from Russia Investigation
New Manafort emails offer stronger evidence of a quid pro quo with a Russian oligarch
Trump put Ivanka and Jared in the White House after past presidents were told it was unlawful

Translation: "Gov Mapp kissed my ass so it was a great meeting."

it's-a me, sneaking past the racism and injustice of the right wing to take my seat at the left
Did he kiss the ring?
You’d have more money to help Puerto Rico if you didn’t waste so much money playing golf and holding rallies
You did sweet fanny adams, you crushing bore...
We love you!!!
The majority of the US does not agree with you.
Thank those who choose to keep everyone safe
Boy you had a busy day patting your own back for the nothing you have done lol!!
It’s ALWAYS about looking for congratulations regarding something the president takes credit for. ALWAYS. 

If the person, or group, or entity DOESN’T shower the president with praise, he says nothing, or is downright nasty.

This is proven with EVERY Trump tweet or comment.
You got that 280 character tweet? Luckyyyyyyyy
What about saving lives intead of just talking??
Great meeting? That was one of the worst meetings I have ever seen and my name is Mr. Terrible Meeting Jr.
Stop talking about "great jobs." Stop looking for praise & credit. Stop throwing paper towels at people. Grow TF up. #FakePresident
You had the NERVE to ask about HOW PR was going to repay the money for rescue efforts!  How DARE you? Did you ask TX, FL, LA, & GA the same?
All your meetings are great.  Says you.     Impeach trump.  Loser
F.U. and your B.S. 'ratings'.
Ours hearts go out to the great people of Puerto Rico!!
He certainly isn't thankful for you. I can tell you that for certain.
You didn't even get the category of the hurricane right in your comments. What an embarrassment.
This is disgusting.
Please just step down!!  We can't take this much longer.
Trump's visit to Puerto Rico was a shoot & miss, just like everyday of this administration...
He could of at least thrown them a happy meal. They need food, water and shelter, not paper towel...that won't soak up the flood water.
I went on a run once that was longer than your time in Puerto Rico
I am sure you think your message shows you to be smart and so with it. It only shows that you are young and immature!
We are all grateful for FEMA and the first responders! They are incredible human beings w compassion and integrity. It's you we aren't
getting a way to PR to help as well, so yeah! I'm working thank you!
Who's complaining? I'm just tired of our "do nothing in chief" taking credit for things he's not doing.
I have served my country, have you?
Hire me : https://goo.gl/WuzNW6

Did you enjoy talking about the F35? To stroke your ego?
Also, just curious but why do you see being Liberal as a bad thing? Because it doesn't seem that bad to me.
That doesn't even make any sense. You understand I am not from the USA? But why is taking the views of others into account a bad thing?
You don't know where I am from, you know where I live. Do you understand the concept that I moved to the UK because of work?
The Poor Gov is agreeing with you only to help his people! You are an EVIL person! You are a Bully, not a President!
If someone's truly thankful, let them express it. If you're always having to congratulate yourself, it's probably not deserved.

Nice talk, telling them that they are costing to much! They are dying me president. Don't throw no paper towels at me!
Never forget. 
#HillaryClinton corruption. 
#Guns
How was your trip there? Oh that's right, you couldn't be bothered.
Did you give him paper towels?
You said "Have a good time"? Did you even have a clue where you were, or why?
No he isn’t.  Lying fool.   God you need a lobotomy.
Don't strain something patting yourself on the back.
@realDonaldTrump  How are you still here? Not as President, but on Earth. Plz go back to your home planet.
Yes, we get it. You think you're wonderful, even though you're really an incompetent, embarrassing, petty, little self-serving failure. Sad.
Thank you
You must resign you cheap taking trips on planes at the expense of the taxpayer you're a cheat and a thief
You compare this to Katrina? Try 2 devastating hurricanes just a week apart. A 1 2 punch in the face of the islands.
Because the most important consideration in a disaster effecting our citizens is KISSING YOUR ASS. #PuertoRicoRelief #GunControlNow

Quit quit go
St. Croix still needs more help! Follow IG @imfit2fight to see the reality videos and drone videos. When he has internet they post. Please.
He's just happy you're leaving. Wake up!
Sure. He upsets you and you cut off help. He knows you.
http://Lies.com 
Show us your taxes... you are a fool.... resign #fakepresident
You are a sick man.  #resign
He has to say that or you won't give assistance.  Baby in chief!!!
I guess ur giving Gov Mapp "thumbs up" because he didn't say anything negative about u. Ur so transparent...And thin-skinned. #fakePOTUS
Our hearts go out to the Americans who live in Puerto Rico . all 3.5 million of them.
@realDonaldTrump @FEMA
Thank you for all the incredible work that was done by FEMA and all the First Responders.
Our RN's on the ground in PR gave great reports as well.  Care packages flowing from mainland.
The problem when you consistently lie is not knowing if what you say is true or is a lie.
Simply assume that EVERYTHING coming out of his mouth is a lie. You will be correct at lesast 95% of the time.
Typical cranky grandpa - only concerned about the Thank You notes!
每个在基层工作的的工人都是值得尊敬的
Don't get distracted by these insensitive acts. Don't get distracted from Russia, Putin
Such an embarrassment
YOU SUCK...YOU HAVE DONE ALMOST NOTHING! YOU COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH MORE!!!
Look at ME  I am a Stupid President
You should spend more time working not tweeting.
Your actions & words today reinforced the belief you are the worst leader of any nation on the planet. Americans are embarrassed!
You are a legend in your own mind.  Yes, FEMA is working hard. But you, Pal, are a boil on the ass of our nation.
All you respond to is someone appearing to suck your,...toes
What, he can't speak for himself?
You did an A+ effort trying to take credit for shit you hD nothing to do with. You’re so embarrassing
To those of you who are so negative, POTUS had 3 hurricanes to deal with and a horrible mass shooting.  Why don't you shut up and help !
Can you say ANYTHING without praising yourself or bullying someone else. Jeez. #sad

I bet you gave him a whole case of paper towels for saying nice things about you.
1. Trump's measure of success is how many people compliment him in a day.
Other's measure of success is how many roads got cleared today, how many homes got power today, how many trucks got through today, etc.
How many people you DIDN'T piss off...
I'm so proud of you! #MAGA #Trump2020 #WhitesForTrump #MakeWomenCookAgain #GHRITP #TrumpTrain #TrumpLove #PuertoRicoRelief
How much money did you give just to him? Shame on you!!!
He was being polite.  We all know you are a troubled old man.  Nasty, sad joke.
So much of this trip was not shown on TV, perhaps there was a video problem with the island.  So proud of our country and what it does!!
#TrumpsAWhiteSupremacist #CombOverlord
U gave the most ignorant, irresponsible outrageous statement to PR. Didn't think ur stupidity could get worse...U out done Ur self
Yes, I remember ,while working at schools, if there a spill u put down paper towels, or the entire roll to absorb the spill. Is that .....
His body language screamed otherwise! Stop LYING, stop TWEETING, work FOR AMERICA, not just you and your base.  Better yet, RESIGN!
He’s kissing your ass to get you on his side. Everyone knows your weakness is your own vanity and they exploit it easily.
The governor of Puerto Rico is holding it all in. Watch his face - he is NOT impressed.
It would be so much easier to appreciate what you do if you weren't such a braggart. Didn't your mother teach you how unattractive that is?
How is your arm? From patting yourself on the back?? Loser!
With your poor leadership better late than never.  I give everyone in PR and in PR effort graces they deserve.
You're the first president to be hands on and now I worry that Las Vegas isn't a setup. Please PROTECT yourself sir! We don't need to lose U
And not at all  "thankful" for the job your weak administration has done.  Resign.
Interesting
Considering “it’s our hard earned money“ they should be thanking the people, it is OUR sweat equity after #UngratefulnessGetsTiring
Please, just resign, u obviously NOT fit for running a country. Lord knows how OFTEN U failed at biz.
Go ahead
Hey POTUS* DOTARD. Death toll is RISING in P.R. Does that help U want 2 help these American's? Only 8% have electricity! NO WATER 4 MAJORITY
it's called "kissing ass" ...  maybe it was lost on you that he is dependent on your mercy and lack of animus towards Puerto Rico??
Still shocked that you were so negative to PR. Trying to compare Katrina to Maria is like oranges&apples  Both were tragic.
How many times have you used the word “tremendous” since January. Next time you’ll be asked to spell it, believe me
U made it to the island? Surrounded by water? In the ocean? The big ocean?
The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, denounced Donald Trump Tues after the president, calling him “miscommunicator-in-chief” and “insulting.”
Brag  brag brag brag. Why must everything be about your over inflated ego?  Can’t  you just visit and offer support? Nah didn’t think so.
How about focusing on the people of PR instead of yourself??
You're a sociopath
Yea idiot throwing paper towels at the people in Puerto Rico only 5%have hydro idiot
Don, I notice you only have great meetings with those who fawn all over you. That's weak & close-minded. Strong leaders have open minds.
Shame that you didn't see or hear real story in Puerto Rico. You are causing budget problems with your constant vacations to your resorts.
Is there a layered state? Time for an election monitored by US/UN. What's the truth?
You threw the budget out of “whack” with your weekly golf trips and making the people who protect you pay for rooms and golf carts.
Maybe you could tweet about what help is still needed instead of patting yourself on your back with those tiny hands.
Who was at meeting? Coast Guard?  Air Force?  Oh yeah u can't tell diff!  #resign
You're kidding, right?  Please resign you clueless clown!
What about his illegal confiscation of firearms and ammo? #SicSemperTyrannis
Ask the people of Puerto Rico dumb ass. His is not politics. It's human lives.
Fema hasn't even Bryn to apartment buildings where the old are starving.  David Muir found them so why can't FEMA. Old people can't get out.
They don't have good and water.  They are starving yet the administrating makes fake news not David Muir who had reported war from the front
Will the real Donald Trump, please stand-up, the room was Trump Tight, not a fake anchor could make a sound!

And then you embarrass Puerto Rico by talking budget debt but you never mentioned budget debt with Texas or Florida.
And what are you doing for the people anything at all easy to stay comfortable on your couch complaining about what other people are doing
#kurdistan blokade
Because the only thing that matters is that he be grateful, right?

It gets worse: Trump denied this request from Puerto Rico... after approving the same request in Texas (after Harvey) & Florida (after Irma) https://twitter.com/thehill/status/915302776057548800 …
Thank you Commander in Chief, PResident Trump, Our Leader,It is Time

you going to let these manufacturing companies keep scalping the people of America who need to repair their homes 15% raise and materials
No what he said is trump get back on your plane we don't want you here and your stinking up the place
so do not think in your robotoid head doing anything silly 
but kremlin have to show their nation what they done to their nation
I would like to personally apologize to the people of Puert RIco for our president. He is not mentally well and cannot help himself.
We can never get enough propaganda from the worst president in history.
