'@realDonaldTrump While you're bringing down drug prices, why not bring down health insurance premiums. Ryancare won't, you know.
@Hisladydiana Stop the drug industry from driving up healthcare and advertising their drugs.
yes completely agree!
Ever listen to the side effects of some of these drugs? Have you heard of medicated dementia?
stop the greed in the medical industry
Can u think of any other service or product u use where u don't know the price be4 u buy?
Can I be a member of the firing squad?
Right on John...POTUS needs feedback from the American People!
It's about damn time, still I'm sure the libtards will find something about this to complain about
making America Great Again!
thank you
.@realDonaldTrump Will people get to keep their iPhones?
Clearly not. @jasoninthehouse already said you must choose between your iPhone and your health care. Were you not listening?
.@realDonaldTrump  Everything this man says is a lie. Is poorly thought out. Is placed there by others. In pocket of Big Pharma.
I'm trying to figure out how to pay $90 a month for a drug for congestive heart failure. Do you see the alternative? Death.
a primary caregiver for an 87 year old neighbor I cannot get his insurance to cover his digoxin why?
thank you Mr President for all your hard work and fighting for we the people...we are with you
I hope so. SO far the drug industry is robbing folks left to right. An asthma medication can cause $250 to 350.
There is already competition in the drug industry. They are competing to see who can set the highest prices.
Why don't u work with @SenSanders to lower Rx costs. Why don't u enact single payer HC?  It covers everyone & much cheaper?
Apill (1 PILL)that cost $50.00 perpill that should only cost $1.00 is INSURANCE COMPANY CORRUPTION #DEREGULATE #FREEMARKETS
Thanks so much for the invite to inauguration!!  Wow "first class mail" was slow.
Thank You! 30 pills $400.00, for my stomach.  I cant afford them!

This is absolutely hilarious!!
pls keep in mind those on 26 or 27k a year living alone in poverty. No dental covg nothing under Obama..
Rep party doesn't give a crap if you have access to affordable health care! Its only going to get worse NOW!
@jarhead_trader A lot of corruption in the UK drugs market. Some overseas families have milked our system for billions.
very sad. Our system has been broken and  milked for years.
The Sunday Times exposed the situation, names and everything, but our politicians chose to sleep through it
The only thing about healthcare going down is the quality of coverage and the people who can afford it.
DRUG COMPANIES SHOULD NOT RULE HEALTHCARE
Can't wait! My meds cost $1700 a month. Been waiting 10 years for them to go generic.
lies
People w/ Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease have to pay way too much for preventative drug, need a cure
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA #DeludedMoronInChief
Right. Defund the coast guard, play footsie with Turkey & our beaches'll be awash in competition. Oh you mean legal drugs?
What about cable companies?The U.S. has the highest cost for cable/internet with the slowest speeds per cost.Lower cost. Ty
#FiretheFool           #FakePresident         #Trumpcaresucks
Wish You could limit All those Drug Commercials Their Everywhere All The Time Now, $$$ It Makes You Sick #DownWithPharma
I wanna know where you are buying your drugs. Judging by your infantile behavior it must be really good shit.
@junogsp5 Competion is key
Lets work on getting fraudulent misinformation on drugs brougnt public so that there can he house cleaning in FDA too.
It should be way down, it's ridiculous that drug companies charge us so much for what is way cheaper in other countries.
... and what about us, @realDonaldTrump ???
your health care bill really stinks... You're messing up my medicine. Leave it akone.
You are guilty of #stockmanipulation @SEC_Enforcement
Drug companies are a scam. Check out the chain of subsidiaries opened to avoid lawsuits after the sales. $50 a pill? BS!
TRUMP NO CHANGING SUBJECT! AMERICA WANTS RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION INTO ELECTION MEDDLING THAT GAVE US YOU! STOLEN ELECTION!
Thank you for taking on Big Pharma! None of our politicians would have done so.
That is good @realDonaldTrump because adults around me want to take more drugs so they can numb your rhetoric out of their consciousness.
@Citywide_MSVP   Like Mexico would pay for the wall?
Probably Russian manufactured drugs
I voted for the first time in my life at the age of 51 for YOU. Please stop DEA punishment of responsible pain patients.
@navy8r Paul Ryan's Health care plan will KILL The GOP
I fail to see how that is possible since it has ZERO chance of becoming law.
You can't even spell the word 'tap' so....good luck with that 
You mean like Tylenol vs Advil? Dro vs reggie? (Ha!) YES Donald, we've seen competition there already.  #BlessYourHeart
Good! Ppl are tired of "stretching" medications they need, yet can't afford on ObamaCare & Medicare Part D!
Only an honest man with integrity admits when he is wrong. @realDonaldTrump is neither.. #DrainTheSwamp #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImpeachTrump
even the price of medical Marijuana?
Saving this tweet for when pharma posts record profits yet again.
Now we're on the right track. If Govt has a role in healthcare this is it.
@DavidActon3 please protect Medicare they need medical more than anyone don't make that mistake it would be a big one wlove
@becasilverstein PHARMACEUTICAL & PRIVATE INSURANCES RIP OFF D SYSTEM, AMERICANS & MEDICARE! INS CO HANDS OFF FR MEDICARE
Prove it.
But will insurance companies cover cancer and post-cancer drugs? Will they cover ANYTHING? We love you, but we're worried.
If only you didn't lie about absolutely everything. Untrustworthy. Unscrupulous. Unattractive. What a maroon. #realnews
Lies
Awesome - keep people drugged and stupid rather than provide healthcare. #1984
I'll believe it when I see it! I' m a chemo RN & the cost of oral chemo is rediculous.
.@realDonaldTrump 
ObamaCare vs TrumpCare
No contest!
We are NOT stupid!
way way down. deeper and deeper. #officespace Please hypnotize me until this presidency is over
Keep up the great work!  I'm proud to call you my president.
How do you find time to work on this new system? Aren't you pretty busy tweeting and watching TV?
please allow us to buy drugs from Canada and Israel.
No matter what you do to the health care it will never work until you put a cap on what the medical and drug company charge
sounds good... why is FedGov involved beyond it's yuge drug buy for Medicare/Medicaid?
Need #tortreform too!
oh so you're finally listening to #Bernie? Great idea!
The ART OF THE DEAL ain't over 'till the Trumpet plays!
We need2cap t costs of minor procedures & All major Surgery's be the same price everywhere! Cost under control @seanhannity
Nothing you do helps the American people. So now you are going to screw up something else. Gee wiz how lucky are we?
let me guess, the drugs are made in Russia?
LIAR!
I know you sell a lot of real estate but how does it feel to sell your SOUL
make weed legal thx
You have said that you would breakdown "BigPharma" so? Why haven't we seen a thing?
LIE
Why aren't illegal immigrants explicitly excluded from these health care tax credits?
and sub-par pharmaceuticals will rise. You can't create competition and believe that lowest bid will still produce quality.
good luck with that...you can't regulate without congress and well...they are bought
work on releasing your taxes and not giving huge taxes breaks to your friends. That may help the American middle class
@rotatingheads pls remove h4 visa EAD program. All entry level jobs are taken by them. US kids and citizens are jobless
What happens when your supporters in rural areas who are on ACA no longer have insurance?  Will they support you?  Big NO!
#MrPresident

Is that b4 or after u take away ACA, Medicare, Social Sec.? U already took away environmental protections, privacy on internet. #DonTheCon
Insurance must cover pre-existing conditions and the 10 Essential Health Care Benefits. Nothing less is acceptable. Period
Does big pharma know this!
Oh yeah because shareholders will be willing to give up gazillions in revenue. Have u talked to your Goldman Sachs swamp cohorts about this?
Believe this & I have a health care plan for you, too!! LOL After the debacles on healthcare & the budget - NO CREDIBILITY!
Great but you just can't expect the opposition to jump a wall in order to propose their sales pitch
you do you. Whats good for you is what is good for me. I happy thats all that matters #makemegreatagain
there's competition now! 3 drugstore in 2mile radius charges 3 different prices for same EXACT meds.
Pres. Trump Please Pardon Dr. Burzynski who has been jailed and held for natural cure of cancer FDA DRUG Lords.
suddenly you are a mathematical genius, huh?
how about real medicine and not poison? STOP THE CDC AND BIG PHARMA! CORRUPT & EVIL!!!
Wait! I thought you said drugs were cheaper than candy bars?
pricing for all health procedures, way too high! No Ryancare! Get Rand Paul to work with Tom Price!!!
Also, let Americans have the right to try cancer treatments available in other countries. No more FDA murder for greed..pls
When is that plan rolling out......Are you ever going to put legislation forward or are u going to keep blaming everyone
great news sir!
Fantastic job ! We are with you no matter what Mr. President ! All of us fighting hard ! Pushing through !

I'll believe it when I see it!
Very interesting. Lots of Pharmaceuticals at this meeting conference. Objectives are ???? numerous.
LIAR
without regulations we are about to get raped by the drug industry. Sad!
TRUMP SOLD OUT HIS VOTERS, leaving them unable to afford health insurance, and gave $200K annual gift to each rich friend.
Sir, Only prob is out of work attorneys will be the new baristas at Starbucks. It will take forever to argue over a latte.
Oxycodone is the drug of choice by most Addicts in this country, not drugs from immigrants.  Another Big Lie
Simple, close the FDA , U.S. Patent office and Shackle courts. Let Big Pharma run wild. Let it be a nuclear war
@TheMorningSpew we need healthcare price transparency
At last some1's gonna utilise #Hemp & #cannabis oil based #medicine 4 it's full 600+ uses, replacing & reducing 60% of pharma drugs #irony
While you're at it, ban opiod painkillers. Forget drugs pouring over the border. We are making them all here and they kill.
Ahhhh so THAT'S why you're goin after weed.  Big Pharma puttin a bit of copper in your pocket? #BoughtlikeHillary

another lie

After meeting with pharma lobbyists, Trump drops promise to negotiate drug prices http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/31/14453740/trump-medicare-prescription-drugs …?
Not a lie, reality and Trump is making America great again, deal with it.
Bringing back good paying jobs and building the freaking wall!
oh sure make america great again with the king of debt

.@realDonaldTrump Ya Sure Donny. Lol
REFUGEES: US govt special 0% business loans $15K, 2.8 Billion public assistance,USAID spent $223 million on microenterprise
sure Donny, sure you are. Everything you touch gets worse. #resign pissoff
thank you.  Thank you!!!
"Legalize it"
then why are the pharmaceutical companies profiting so much off of #Trumpcare
Until all costs for medical goods, and services  are the same across our nation, no change will be successful.
All great things take time. Please reassess the plan for our sakes.
@DavidActon3 Thank you SIR run all 8 years we need and love  you and your family President Trump sounds so good to here
good thank you
Is it Conservatist blasphemy for government ie: @potus @vpotus , to FACILITATE
 (not direct) scaling up bulk tenders?
Keeping hands out of it , does not prevent clapping and cheering on great buying practices for The People!
.@realDonaldTrump just get rid of the FDA
As other admins in other countries want the prices down as well. Where Drug Industry get development funds?
As you well know: in business/development one can fail and go bankrupt or one can succeed by just pricing.
nothing you proposed is cheaper or better, well maybe for your billionaire buddies
Actually Trump will force the Pharmaceutical companies to lower prices.
Stop with your liberal BS
How will he do that? He lacks the ability to. Stop with your GOP blinders
Listen buddy, I worked in campaigns at age 9, that's right, 9, and voted Democrate for 40 years...this is not your fathers Democratic party
Show me one successful thing Trump has done for the average person? He's a joke
bringing back high paying jobs, energy independence, ending sanctuary cities, new Sheriff in town, get use to it, no more red lines ignored
Except by Russia and Syria Trump is a joke
