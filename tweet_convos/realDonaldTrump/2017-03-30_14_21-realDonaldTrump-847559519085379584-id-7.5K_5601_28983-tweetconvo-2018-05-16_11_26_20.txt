Mr President Donald Trump do not let this internet bill past the sell our information to the from the is peas bad idea
You are no leader! YOU are a bully who has no means of uniting people only to divide them and try to break them. NOT US! #RESISTANCE
Lol. "Bully".... 
yes he's calling out the Freedom Caucus not for being beholden to their conscience but for opposing Trump! Bullying! Need a definition? lol
And for the RECORD. I Think Trump made a stupid error and is foolish for calling out the Freedom Caucus, as they helped him get elected.
this is how this whole thing started... what Trump is doing is bullying but not to you right? LOL
I sincerely hope for your sake, that this investigation finds something. Otherwise... it'll be me doing the lols at you. Egg on face 
Its about our democracy if this fool colluded with Russia that affects ALL Americans not just Dems! But whatever eases your mind...
By glad you'll accept final result whatever the conclusion. If they rule no collusion, glad you'll accept that.
LOOK UP YOUR STINKING AS*....
your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost
Disgraceful president
Where? Firmly planted up your butt
Just repeal it, don't replace it. Let the free market fix it.
I like the way you think.
Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador? #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare...
Seems congressman and Senator should be in the same health care plan and retirement plan that their constituents are in let's see him step up and do the right thing for a change or drain the swamp
Why don't you get them all in a room and work it out!
They're saying the same thing as you did before your inauguration!  #KeepYourword!

Like it or not sir, conservatives gave you the job.  Dance with the ones who brought you. Don't get wobbly. Don't give us Obamacare lite!
Dunno did you find them yet
Think they were going into the toilet when I was coming out #EverybodyPoops
Doesn't #RepealANDReplace sound too much like #SelectivelyModify??? Think about it . . .

Stop trying to put bandages on terminal cancer!!!!
Over 75% of voters approve of the ACA...
I thought you said earlier that you never intended to repeal and replace the affordable care act? You keep changing your words which is it?
Free-market? Not in this country! No such thing!
they are patriots

Why? Satisfaction with #Obamacare is at an all time high, has saved thousands of lives, and protected the #vulnerable. #Trumpcare is a #joke

.@JoshRosner: the Obama admin took billions of dollars from Fannie and Freddie to fund Obamacare... and is still trying to cover its tracks 
how's that concept working out for you so far donny
Repeal and Replace the Trump version of MAGA.
HAHAHAHA SO FUNNY
Eliminate gov mandates in healthcare use free market.
WE NEED TO KEEP ACA DO NOT REPEAL! Tweak the things not working too many depend on it & Republicans will lose in 2018 & 20. Be with winners!
Reclaim the 10th Amendment- REPEAL and DON'T REPLACE Obamacare
Where is the president? Oh, out on the@golf course
They are fighting for what you ran on. They are doing what is right for the Republican party.

remember who your real friends and Patriots are...the Freedom Caucus!
I've got two words for you president Trump
FIX IT!
need to fix obamacare! great start, but let's make it better... Also there is no plan B for the GOP.
Not willing to work with you. Time to resign or be impeached.
Repeal and replace. Include premium reduction
They must be looking after the interests of their constituents.
Mr President please work a compromise with the Freedom Caucus & not the evil Dems. Push Ryan to give in@some.
Probably trying to figure out a real healthcare biil. Yours and the republicans is not as plan. It is a insult.

Let's do anything just to divert the Russian Trump scandal off the web. Trump Russia Trump Russia. What a disgrace and unpopular boy u r.
Listen to ALL these Republicans.  Make sure the bill you put through & support is what you promised your supporters.
These guys supported you in election, Ryan didnt. They just want to get it right. I am afraid this bill wont work in the end. Be careful.
they r sharpening their pencils for your Impeachment! Or resignation. #Barronneedshisdaddy.
No conviction just seat in congress. You could oust half of them. Prosecute one.
Meadows and Jordan are obstructionists. Screw TeaParty. Smash Caucus and pass legislation promised.
Russia does interferes w/us. Stop them.
do not replace.  Let market do it's job. #GetGovtOutOfHealthcare
Stop blaming Freedom Caucus and thank them for saving Americans from bad deal. You need to get off the ESTABLISHMENT TRAIN.
They are where the people they got to vote for you want them to be-we will NOT primary the Freedom Caucus-you need to use their ideas
Do the right thing APOLOGIZE I stand with #FreedomCaucus Don't lose conservative vote
#impeachandreplace gobble neck trump
1st drop corporate interests in Bill!. Fight their #Greed! They buy #Congress, so its #Corrupt to #Americans! #DTS! @StephenBannon @RandPaul
Maybe replace it if it is something that's worth replacing it with. The TrumpCare Disaster was not it. TrumpCare was not looking to #MAGA.
NO! Just fix Ocare
Bend over, we will show you! Lol
They r doing the right thing
NO REPLACE..REPEAL ONLY The #FreedomCaucus IS TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM SELF-DESTRUCTION..SUPPORTING @SpeakerRyan WILL DESTROY YOUR INTEGRITY!
YES! Let's not use established political channels, they are part of the SWAMP! Let's instead SCREAM at people on TWITTER!
yes I hate when @realDonaldTrump uses twitter, cause then dim-witted numbnuts like u respond & bam Proof all neanderthal r not dead
In 1989, did you have 3 top execs of your casinos die under mysterious circumstances?
Twinkle twinkle little czar Putin put you where you are. #LiarInChief #Trump #usa
She deserves to go to prison as many people have for much prettier offenses in or towards society.
. Where is a qualified and sane president?

Trumpcare was a failure from the beginning

I trust them more than SOH. we want affordable HC with pre existing & kids to 26
Take away congress exemption of Obamacare ! See how they like it!
We are praying for you @realDonaldTrump #PrayForTrump #GodBlessAmerica
DT has now joined the swamp
Please get government out of my choice for healthcare. I like catastrophic insurance, savings & pay cash 4 doc visits. I am responsible 4 me
U R pissing off your base. Freedom Caucus is a national treasure.
ARRESTING A FEW PEOPLE IN THE SHADOWS MIGHT HELP.
great question sir! I believe @RepMarkMeadows is sniffing some NWO now! Check* 
should just admit his lies, & stop sabotaging @realDonaldTrump *
waiting for you to come up with a much better plan
You understand this is a Hatch Act violation, RIGHT?
Ethics 101- You can't put official titles and WH photos all over your "personal" Twitter page and use it for partisan politics.  Hatch Act
Don't blame conservatives for not voting foe Obamacare Light. Remove at least 5 of the onerous 15 mandates and they will support you.
last seen out buying kevlar vests. anyone near you is going down
FYI @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @Raul_Labrador say same today they said in 2009! Gov doesn't belong in HC biz! #FullRepeal
Labrador is ok.  Just a little slow
The freedom caucus was with you before the election  not ryan. Dont throw them under the bus because anbad bill by ryan
Move on you already lost this one
Don't trust Ryan
They are supported by the base that elected you!
Not golfing? Not taking away rights? Not wishing that many people in this country die at their hands? *shrug*
Duck and laberdoodle are two peas in a shit stank pod that is the direction of the modern #republican party.  #embarrassing #ignorant
I guess the sane approach was in fact not to repeal & replace but to respectfully revise, Obama no genius was a few steps ahead of you!
Where are they?  In a business meeting preparing all the paperwork for your Impeachment.  Yippie!!
Probably at the Doctor!
To the Representatives - thank your for your courage & convictions! #standuptotrump
Paul Ryan is the Swamp Thing.  To Drain the Swamp you need to let him FOLLOW, not lead.  He's is your "Worm Tongue".  Run him through!
UR team is bashing
@freedomcaucus
U need 2 meet them not
Kowtow 2 #moderate @gop
#RINO demands
Have UR guys back off
Not good 4 U
@POTUS
If you abandon conservatives, u r 1 term and will be FIRED.

They're doing their job. Why aren't U? Their job is adhering to the Constitution and keeping their promise to us. Why aren't U?
WITH WHAT? NO HEALTHCARE, OR JUST TELL SENOIR TO GO F THEMSELVE. IMPEACHMENT IS COMING : - )
Repeal and Replace @realDonaldTrump.
Please listen to these guys!!!  They are not steering you wrong with us conservatives.
I am against all caucuses.  This group pressure funded by swampers @Heritage @club4growth is hurting Americans @freedomcaucus saved #ACA
@RepMarkMeadows Do listen to this President. Vote No.
EXCUSE ME?!? @Jim_Jordan is MY Rep. in OH and I stand with Jim on this AND ALL issues! He's NEVER went RINO - YOU need to work WITH him!!
Really? Does anyone think Chump Trump reads any comments?! Not a chance!
They are working on making a better healthcare bill. Join them so we can #MAGA
Not making fun of handicapped people, disparaging POW'S and constantly lying and not calling it fake

that was tried and failed, remember ?
Thank you for being tough enough to take the hate. You are a patriot with common sense. God bless you Mr. President.
We need to repeal and replace Donald Jesus Trump
President Trump, Stop attacking the Freedom Caucus and work WITH them
Talk 2 ur friend @seanhannity He will tell u ur making BIG mistake blaming wrong ppl in @freedomcaucus U shld b blaming @SpeakerRyan & #GOPe
Standing on side laughing @ u bc u supported wrong bill that wld make u look foolish! @freedomcaucus has our support! Ur crap bill did NOT!
They're golfing at Mar-a-Lago
So sweet how you shame and bully ANYONE that disagrees with you 

Like a whiney baby.
Mr President you tried now just let Obama care run it's course  let the Democrats explain another huge loss to their supporters with no Ins.
Maybe they don't think "Lite" lipstick looks so good on your Obamacare pig.
They are doing the right thing for the millions of Americans who need affordable healthcare.  

We must ensure everyone.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan Waiting for a REAL plan that lowers costs and is affordable. Promises don't cut it!
They're no different than @SenWarren @SenSanders and others on the far left. Ideaology clouds their judgment. Both sides of the aisle.
Stop tweeting Donald!!
Turning on your base is not the best strategy. I support the @FreedomCaucus. #MAGA
No to all republicans in 2018! Out of control.
#Evil, Evil Man

@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @Raul_Labrador
Theres so much information out there fb twitter youtube
WE SUPPORT YOU MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ARE DOING AN AWESOME JOB!! MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA
hiding? Maybe deeper In the swamp.
Looking at defunding faith based initiatives to ensure separation of church and state. So proud of them.

Without fail you prove again you are not FIT to be President.

Really?  It was the Freedom Caucus that stood with u before u 1. While Ryan and the establishment were working against you.  THAT'S WHERE.
Probably trying to put more distance in between them and you with your dismal approval numbers. It's a no-brainer. Get it together.
Just repeal and send back to state level where it belongs. Not too hard to understand
USA Loves POTUSs Eye of the Tiger 
They are retaining their dignity!
All of a sudden you care about the AHCA again? You are a joke.
Is this a game?
I spy with my little eye... President Bannon!
Where's Hillary? I don't know, but she AIN'T in the White House!
Your party is starting to implode!  BOOM!!  HAHAHAHAHA
It's time rep figure out how to govern and how to win for their voters.   They can't just be against things and never produce anything
Most unpopular president in U.S. history, that's you, Pal.  hahahaha
They're laughing their asses off waiting for you to be in prison for treason.
Might be the first time @Jim_Jordan ever got something right! For wrong reasons, but will take it!
You blew it! You couldn't deliver! You couldn't sell a date with a supermodel on a troop ship at this point. TIME TO PACK IT UP!
They were smart enough 2 know that ur plan is a disaster. Work on placing caps on ins co & pharmacuticals. Leave the ACA alone. It's fine.
Disagree first time with Hannity and Ingraham that I love. The freedom caucus blew it! Gave us a huge defeat. Narrow minded and dangerous!
the bill sucks, you can do better, as it stands it will take you down
