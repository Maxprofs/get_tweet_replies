Trump, you & Ryan are trying to take away health care for cancer patients b/c PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. But yeah RT this Trump. U totes care
@realDonaldTrump unless you're poor right? Then you should probably just give up because #Trumpcare isn't here to help
@realDonaldTrump Why not spend an additional $55 billion to find a cure for cancer & health care vs for the military?
R they able to protect you from ISIS if necessary?
I'm familiar with the statistics.But 130 million voted last yr,I wouldnt want to endanger
You are more likely to be struck by lightening than killed in a terrorist attack.
Right, ur talking about today.
About 3,000 Americans died in terrorist attacks 01-14. Roughly 7 million died of cancer.
I am sorry you were treated that way. The left are haters. Prayers to you. Blessing and good luck.
There's no chance if you live in America...absolutely no chance. The land where doctors get paid to murder with chemo.. Haha
@realDonaldTrump If you rely on Pharma then you have no chance at all. No cures for anything in 100 years. Criminals!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends NEVER GIVE UP, even when THE PRESIDENT AND GOP CONGRESS TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE.
Universal Health Care for every human being
That, and health insurance.
@ainsleyearhardt within 2 mins it jumped to $58,000...#foxnews viewers are amazing
@realDonaldTrump plan my positivity is all i will have bcz i am 58 years old and will be paying so much more and i can't work
@realDonaldTrump also, never lose your health insurance
Except under the republican's terrible new health care bill. Then you're dead. And the rich are richer.
@realDonaldTrump There are natural cures for cancer. But many people are unaware, people have been cured.
@realDonaldTrump My husband died from colon cancer 6 mos ago so I like this retweet but you still need to release your taxes
.@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump you won't have to give up, you'll be impeached...
@realDonaldTrump cancer is the worst and what is even worse is when an administration wants to abolish the healthcare system
@realDonaldTrump You need to BREAK UP with that make-up, boo! You ain't cute
you must talking about trudeau right ?
oBOMBa and killary will be indicted this year, btw I'm drowning in your liberal tears
@realDonaldTrump #FridayThoughts
You're sickest yet ANF far from the greatest
@realDonaldTrump how do you fight cancer with no health-insurance? And how do you fight the cancer at WH ?
@realDonaldTrump God never made a cancer and no other power could. Never give up is sound advice and prayer works. Thank you
@realDonaldTrump
He's relating the message to himself....Trump totally missed the point...geesh
.@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Is this a pep speech from yourself to yourself?
Is the heat from the Russia Investigation getting to you, thinking maybe you should turn yourself in??

liberals and dems just don't get it. Idiots
@realDonaldTrump #RepealAndReplace #POTUS #WeThePeople #DrainTheSwamp #AmericaFirst #LockHerUp #Flamingos4Trump #Breaking
@realDonaldTrump bring out the cure! I know there is one. They cured Jimmy Carter.  I guess the cure is only for the rich
@realDonaldTrump GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND  
Never give up. New procedures all the time.
@realDonaldTrump KYLE- wishing you all the best in your fight. Kick cancer's butt!!
@realDonaldTrump check
@realDonaldTrump I've never seen such a closed minded hateful bunch of people. Dems need to try and help fix things obama did
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump But with #Trumpcare a lot of people won't have a choice but to give up... #SaveACA #resist #notmypresident
i disagree. We are still under Obamacare...  we don't even qualify for OBAMACARE.
i just want AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE! And not be penalized if we can't afford to pay for ins.
so are you for the new GOP plan bc it does not fix any coverage issues & still has a penalty..
assumptions need to see for myself. Don't take anyone's word.
They aren't assumptions it's literally in their bill... Cutting off Medicaid he said he wldnt do
has he done it
This is where the poor and the elderly will get their health care if #TrumpCare is passed.
@realDonaldTrump
You give Trump 1 month before declaring he is a failure?
@realDonaldTrump #Trumpcare sucks. You said more people would be covered & have better coverage. Fucking liar.
here is someone too illiterate to read the proposal & depends on the headlines & soundbites!
@realDonaldTrump Where is that "beautiful" healthcare plan you promised in Jan? Universal coverage = your words #AnotherLie
There are many who chose to never give up. Then ACA came and gave them a real shot. @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump
and screwed the rest of us who had our own insurance and now we dont we can not afford ACA.
Great 7% of the population ruins it for the rest. ACA could've fixed years ago. #Trumpcare doesn't do a thing to lower prices.
No caps on premiums, deductibles, or max out of pocket. Tax breaks for ins co's and wealthy. Individual market costs aren't coming down.
And #Trumpcare ends employer mandate to provide insurance to employees. Wait until co's decide to eliminate this cost from their books.
@realDonaldTrump My friend got through his horrible cancer and survived thanks to the Afordable Care Act. #ThanksObama

is this the right place to post that?
#DeportMelania as legal immigration never proved
I wanna see her long form ORIGINAL papers.
Made possible by the care affording him from ACA. ACA will ensure he can't be denied coverage.
SamanthaBee should be fired! She is stupid and mean. Get rid of her!!!
if someone could be fired for being stupid & mean,Trump would be out of a job #Impeach #TrumpRussia #NoDAPL
Bhuzz, you keep saying "impeach" like it's going to happen. It's not. Get over it
steps away from impeaching your president
what is their obsession with the phrase "get over it"?
Mumz, it's because Trump was elected by 30 states & You r determined to fight that
the American majority, who voted against this psychopath, will see to it.
@realDonaldTrump and that's why you want to take away healthcare from millions of Americans? #resign
stop listening to the liberal leftist don't drink the Kool-Aid
more very fake CNN News unless you have evidence to the contrary
25 million to end the lawsuit so he could concentrate on serving our country
not familiar with that lawsuit I'd have to check it out but what's your point?
This contradicts @realDonaldTrump's plan to open euthanasia centers across U.S. in twisted effort to reduce healthcare costs.
jeff, seriously, what is wrong with you? Why would you say such a hateful thing?
I never said @realDonaldTrump raped anybody, just that he was accused. #MAGA
Jeff, not funny
Agreed.
Just keep spewing HATE proof of a liberal. They are only about HATE.  GODless
No proof that @realDonaldTrump raped anybody, only accusations.
lots and lots and lots of accusations
Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP
for the next rally fund us at 
http://Usapray4trump.com   @March4Trump RT&Share
@realDonaldTrump how dare they make fun of such a beautiful young man unbelievable anybody would make fun of a child w/cancer
how dare trumpcare kick millions off..some with cancer as well, some with heart disease, some..
Examples? If ANYONE'S lost med. care, thank Owebama...
FACTS? How about POTUS has NOT changed anything yet? Lost ins. High cost on #44...
I'm sorry, but I believe that hes done more for the country than Obama did in 8 years
RT @foxandfriends: "Never give up....that's the worst thing you could do. There's always a chance." -Kyle Coddington's m...
Money no object
If you guys fire Sean I will never turn Fox News again
@realDonaldTrump yes you are right
When is TJ Max giving out bonuses, didn't they get a Large Tax Cut from Trump ?
@realDonaldTrump
Only 58% I thought it would be at least 85% of ppl not liking this pathological liar, P***yGrabber
You are stripping HC from millions of people who would LOVE to not give up.
#Trumpcare is a disaster.

@realDonaldTrump these  comments by dem's confirms democrats are the party of hate
no, it confirms that not all sick people will get the media attention and help..that's all
Nah, we just woke. 
woke up to? That not all will get the care needed and some will die under trumpcare
you're so full  you don't know what Trumps healthcare package is.
it is age based tax credits, the older you are the less you get, it wants to put
those with pre existing conditions in a separate pool which lowers the cost of the
young and healthy but their costs increase, depending on income to the point it isnt
@realDonaldTrump The #LiberalHate groups can't even find one good thing to say here#Liberals love hate, but not much else
i can but then i think of all those not made famous who will die, what about them?
Like Kyle they will be brave and like Kyle they will inspire others to be brave
bravery doesn't beat cancer..treatments do and yes one must be brave, my mom is on her 4th rnd
God Bless Kyle.
TRUMP BOT!

BLOCK & REPORT!
EPA fights cancer every day by limiting exposure to hazardous chemicals in our homes, air and water.
organite helps too .......... them pesky chemtrails prob give us cancer
@realDonaldTrump YES! Do it like us and NEVER GIVE UP! Just don't expect Paul Ryan or other HEALTHY PEOPLE to pay for you!
The WORST thing you could do is KEEP your coverage under the ACA, that would be the WORST!
Risperdal / Billionaire
@realDonaldTrump cause a positive attitude will help when ppl have no insurance to cover treatment 
I don't have it now Obama care took my dr my plan my choice and more money than I can afford
An equally good message for those fighting Trump and his Trumpistas.
But not paying for it, under Trump's new plan.
Sorry, didn't realize I was talking to the captain of the debate team.
That was an insult, but I'm not surprised it went over your head.
this is beautiful
@realDonaldTrump but you are cutting funding for cancer research?!
I wonder if you'll still tell his story when he no longer has health insurance.
Because when you lose your healthcare, hope is really the only thing you've got to fall back on.
@realDonaldTrump If you have healthcare, that is.
Look, you aint funny. Your life is just a joke.
@PolitiShox hope he is not on the #trumpcare or #ryancare because your #potus is killing #obamacare = killing him
RSO from canibis cures cancer !
Hires the best ppl! EnergyDept parts company w/appointee who called Muslims maggots
@realDonaldTrump the Samantha bees of the world  needs to get their sick political agenda and bully labels of hate    Stopped
hi have you ever heard using sour honey to treat your cancer so some research on it?
Your breath stinks so bad that it destroyed half the ozone layer.
@realDonaldTrump AS IF U CARE. 
,ignorance of the left is insulting 2dirt!We are the 1's tired 2of the blatant disregard 4humanity!Love the hair,prayers 2u!
@realDonaldTrump not if your disaster of a healthcare bill goes through
@realDonaldTrump Broke my heart, & God Bless & keep that fine young man.
@realDonaldTrump you don't need affordable chemo and meds to deal with the side effects, you just need to buck up buttercup!
we are in prayer for a full recovery Kyle. Luke 1:37.
NEVER TRUST YOUR MEDICAL DOCTORS.
@realDonaldTrump My Wife of 18 years and mother of my 2 beautiful daughter's has Stage 4 breast cancer. Need a CURE now!!
I can't wait til we can pay for our cancer treatments with the money we save in our health savings accounts.
Does he say what to do without insurance?
@realDonaldTrump great video bro but what about all those people you want to kick off health insurance
@realDonaldTrump Does @FoxNews pay you to promote their broadcasts and website? Its nice to know you watch TV & Tweet all day
@realDonaldTrump at least until he's dropped from insurance and left to die.  Good job GOP.
@realDonaldTrump the irony of posting the while lobbying to take away coverage...
@realDonaldTrump and get your treatment in the ER! Oh, they don't do that? Nice knowing ya!
@realDonaldTrump isn't he a supporter of #NeverTrump?
Hilarious considering your trying to literally KILL #Americans.

until Congress takes away your healthcare  #KremlinCohorts #KremlinGate  #Complicit
@realDonaldTrump there isn't even a fighting chance if you don't have insurance
with Trumpcare, he will likely die
@realDonaldTrump you retweet Fox and Friends. What a pathetic president.
except you won't have much of a chance without insurance thanks to Trumpcare.
@realDonaldTrump That is absolutely correct! Never ever give up whatever you do!
Unless you lose your health insurance and can't get treated. Which *is* going to happen.
My girlfriend has cancer in her lungs that spread to her bones It`s stage 4 . I know that she will pull through it . 
With all due respect, is not healthcare the first and MOST important issue though? For everyone I mean?
But the #Trumpcare let's insurance companies put back lifetime Caps. It defunds the subsidy that helps pay portion your policy....
Not what trumpcare says - cancer patients will be CAPPED and cut-off
@realDonaldTrump If you can afford that stupid haircut AND chemo then you're not one of the people in danger.  So shut up.
Great to know you are cutting everything for those in need, and making decisions based on Sean Hannity. SAd
Trumpcare means people with cancer should just euthanize themselves, because cost is unaffordable
@realDonaldTrump I do realize Kyle supports #NeverTrump ???
RU saying after obliteration of ACA & Planned Parenthood people shouldn't give up & keep trying to pray away
@realDonaldTrump but your tossin more ppl off healthcare making hard for them to afford to treat cancer.
Even when the President takes your health insurance away . . .

never give up.
I am so pleased our so-called president spend time watching a hard hitting news show such as F&F. A joke!
If I gave you a penny for your thoughts, I'd get change.
@realDonaldTrump my brother and MIL both fighting cancer now. I lost my dad a few years ago. All we have is hope.
infact, a huge most probable success defeating illness(es) IF putting Trust in JESUS Healing
@realDonaldTrump Me too. If  you take away my coverage to give your cronies billions I'll be http://dead.You  proud @realDonaldTrump?
You are the greatest accident mother nature has ever encountered
I know if I read through replies to this tweet there'd be haters playing anti-anythingTrump politics on AHCA
@realDonaldTrump this is sad and both sides need to rethink belittling &a disrespecting. Kyle, u r an inspiration
thank you for Real donald Trump showing transparency without the press corp for Tillerson trip.. ridiculous
my brother has brain cancer.  he too is staying strong, positive and not giving up.  God bless you.
@realDonaldTrump kewish phone threats was a Muslim black dude and Jew cemetery vandalism was a proven hoax.
also don't lose your health insurance because of horrible legislation
@realDonaldTrump Unless of course #Trumpcare gets passed, then the best you can hope for is to die quickly.
Gracious young man.God's got you covered. Blessings come even in trials,this young man knows the true healer
TRUMPCARE taking away insurance from millions, including seniors, children, people w/ disabilities
It looks like your face caught on fire and someone tried to put it out with a fork.
Give us the exact health coverage that Congress gets.
COPY AND PASTE
Well good for Kyle--cuz under your new AWFUL ACA, 'good wishes' will be all he has. #FuckYourInsincerity
After Trumpcare is implemented, they won't be so optimistic.
@realDonaldTrump Less of a chance now that the @GOP is destroying US healthcare.
Well since you're taking their healthcare away what do u expect them to do? Pray? @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump unless you have #trumpcare!
I called your boyfriend gay and he hit me with his purse
@realDonaldTrump And for those fighting cancer who will lose their healthcare???? What do you and that rat Ryan day to them?
@realDonaldTrump it's not like you're going to have any Healthcare to help with your terminal illness.
Amen my friend. Thanks for being classy.
Nice Aryan haircut.

WEe'll never give up trying to #impeach @realDonaldTrump and removing your admin from office #resist
