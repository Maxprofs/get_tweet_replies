you didn't do this. You realize that right?
Can you make a list of everything you be done so far?  Trying to keep track and I want to show my liberal son.
The number of jobs you're looking to beat: 9.2 million that Obama added during his tenure. Or the 21m Clinton added.
Great job president Trump

700 jobs and a smaller investment. Bad deal. I expected more from a braggart of your caliber.
the Obama Administration allowed Chrysler and Takata to buy out the government so they can pay less to Consumers
great! Now let's not build that multi billion dollar wall. Nobody but you wants it and it's a disgusting waste of money

thank you Mr President elect for bringing back jobs and hope back to this country! America will be forever grateful!
you can thanks president @BarackObama for saving the auto industry.
Don't you mean thank the tax payer, Obama used $0 of his money to bail them out.
first, Obama pays taxes too, second, it was his call. Others wouldn't have made the decision.
he gave away OUR money. No major accomplishment.
ignorance is bliss
sounds like you're speaking from experience.
no major accomplishments, eh?
trump supporters don't like facts or intellectuals to be honest

No kidding but you have to take credit for the good and the bad as it works both ways.
so other then repealing the disaster of Obamacare how can Trunp keep retail like he has car industry
Wow! That's the point. He had nothing to do with anything in the car industry but took credit for it anyway!
yeah okay. Trust me car companies don't want to pay extra when NAFTA dies and know
going to kill regulations that has killed industry in US! Trump putting us on even ground again
if  the US is placing  tariffs on everything  it imports wow all things will cost so much more
#TrumpLovesGoldenShowers
This move by FORD is the result of Union efforts over many many months.  It has NOTHING to do with u. NOTHING
So impressive...NOT
would you take your President salary and donate it to our U. S. Hungry children PLEASE.

You're so fake that Barbie is more real than you.
so donald come to Australia to meet Abbott
The sun rose today. Are you going to take credit for that also?
you had nothing to do with this
This deal was in works way before you claimed you caused it so such a liar!!!
Your asinine simian countenance alludes that your fetid stench has annulled the anthropoid ape species diversity.
yes thanks to the United Auto Workers Union. Pres Obama created an environment for this to take place.
..This in itself is a conflict of Republican belief. I stand behind you, but believe it should be reconsidered. #MuslimBan
and when do you plan to close your plants in China making your clothes ??? Still waiting.
They announced this 16 months ago. It was an agreement with UAW. A labor union. Don't try to get credit.
give us a hug diva
Wait...who saved the auto industry, exactly? It was a president, yes, but I think his name started with OBAMA!
Your asinine simian countenance alludes that your fetid stench has annulled the anthropoid ape species diversity.

You are ridiculous.
If you really want to know about mistakes, you should ask your parents.

I would like you to go abandon or revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.
fake news right hear!!!!!
Sessions.  denied  federal judgeship  1986 after  Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony that he made racist remarks
Yo mama so ugly she scared the crap out of the toilet
.
Ford Mexican plant was to build cars it sells mainly in Mexico. Plans to expand Michigan plants were unrelated. LIAR!
Hey Trumpie
So what about the pic with Ronald Reagan? U r sadly in need of attention and drama. U need a pat on ur back for every move
This wasn't your deal in the first place u con artist.
worst cabinet worst choice on people you doing right for putin love him
Your mom must have a really loud bark!
Yo momma so fat, when her water broke she created the Pacific Ocean.
No credit to you - you did nothing.  You need adoration so badly; glad to see there are others who don't give it to you.

Trump is not really beating his chest just trying to inform America before the media spins it
If you were twice as smart, you'd still be stupid.
good thing Ford Fiat decided that on 2015
you had nothing to do with that.  It's been in place since 2015, but sure, keep thinking you did something.
shady business just like you!
Yes thank you Mr.President elect Trump.
Made in America will be nice!
That was the plan before they heard of you
Trump Bragged About Saving a Ford Factory That Was Never Closing
NOTHING TO DO WITH YYOU FAKER!
Trump is taking credit for an accomplishment by Fiat that was made  possible under President Obama guidance and leadership
@FordMX Mi primer auto lo iba a adquirir con uds, lamentablemente as√≠ como no apoyan a M√©xico, no los apoyaremos tampoco.
PEOPLE. Dont listen to idiots. I KNOW FIRST HAND that these decisions were largely because of Trumps policies!!!
THIS decision had absolutely nothing to do with you
And thanks to President Obama!
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? Like a coma.
that's awesome. Perhaps some of the money coming into Michigan could assist in the Flint water problem?
Again thank you President Obama for saving our auto industry.
FORD CEO states they were opening that Plant before you even announced it.  Way to take credit low-life
Pres. Trump, you must procecute Clinton! 300 pages from the FBI? You have to Act.
Maybe afeter yhe cleans the pee off @realDonaldTrump will be better suited to prosicute anyone
Interesting a @realDonaldTrump who cares about spelling. Might I ask what you are referencing?
look at your Jan 10 post and you tell me. Also, the educated care about spelling.
So you classify @realDonaldTrump fans as "the educated"  Interesting position Bless your heart
Fake news.
Slow down!!! We are getting tired of winning... NOT!!! STEP IT UP!!!!!

Great work Mr. President Elect.
BLACK BARBARA, HEEEYYY MR PRESIDENT!!!! HAD TO SAY A LITTLE SOMETHING, SOMETHING BABY, COULDN'T HOLD MY PEACE ANY LONGER!!!

Yep, going to China instead; is that better than Mexico???????? Making China Great Again!
#MCGA
Thank you Barack!
I called your boyfriend gay and he hit me with his purse
i think i will buy a ford this time!
careful what you take credit for. Ford is still expanding in Mexico and US existing plants, but due to market trends.
so when are you going to make ties in the US?
thank you to the UAW that negotiated this over a year ago as part of their new contract.
Your IQ has to be like 75-ish
Learn from your parents mistakes - get sterilized

Thank you Mr president for not receiving the Sassou Nguesso just yesterday in put in jail Mr Okombi Salisa on opponent is life is in danger

"On Tuesday, Ford announced it will shift its Michigan production of the Focus to China. "  GOOD job russian piss drinker.

Korea,Russia scares the hell outa me. You have fooled a whole country just like Hitler did.
My family of Detroit MI all PO, Pastors and/or Lawyers are 100% divided and Negative due to the EX outrankings!
if Ford stayed in Mexico, they would need a redesign to enable wall jumping back to USA
Hey Trumpy did your friend Putey pretend you were friends and then throw you under the bus.
