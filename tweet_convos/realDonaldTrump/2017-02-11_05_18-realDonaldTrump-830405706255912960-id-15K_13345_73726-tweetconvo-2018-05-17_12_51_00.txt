And then @realDonaldTrump tweeted….. 
"SEE YOU IN COURT" 
After just LOSING IN COURT
Supreme Court.  But cute meme, bro.
you have already built a wall around our people Please resign!
don't drunk tweet
can you build a border wall out of hot air and lies? Those come cheaply for you.
not your place to be concerned illegal person
in what way am I an "illegal person"?
illegal immigrant stupid
Yes, let's start blaming "the government" on determining the cost of the wall...that Mexico is paying for?
I think that it is cheaper to bury a landmine rather than to build a wall at the border.
I'm Honda Mio!
Perhaps you should just stay out of everything and resign.
SEE YOU IN COURT!
Trump: SEE YOU IN COURT

@HillaryClinton: 3-0
#TheResistance
They have popcorn in prison?
@POTUS You're reading? Actual words on paper? Or are you watching CNN and FOX and "reading" about it.

which part of underground tunnels do the wall people not understand??? Tunnels under Tuscan wall now!
POLICE OFFICERS TO THE BORDER! WE NEED HELICOPTERS, BOATS, DRONES, ANYTHING HELPS! WE NEED TO STOP MEXICAN INCURSIONS!
The government can send bill to Mexico-build wall after money is recived from Mexico.
you need to get into real journalism u have a awesome future!
You? Reading? OH WHEN WILL YOUR LIES EVERY END DONALD?
The wall will be paid with all the government benefits we are going to stop giving to illegal aliens.
... thank god the aeroplane hasn't been invented yet so people wont be able to fly over it
Have you tried that? Didn't think so.
Tried what? I'm sure you can fly into America. In fact I'm almost positive.
No passport and no visa. Don't think so.
Lol

I want u impeached
@DonaldTumpEgo good to have it   'merry Christ Xmas and happy new year 2018
I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten inv...
I will donate to the wall!!
we don't care what it costs use Drug Money and money we save from getting illegals off welfare


streamline the IRS  let go thousands of fed employees.  I think the unlawful ones should build the wall
wow
seems like many of you are making the same joke. Typical liberals. No original thought between any of you. Hahaha
So funny
The cost is irrelevant,  in the end it will save our country much $$$$$$$$!
Twyla why don't you go and try to read something that makes a little more sense than what you just said 
Building the WALL will save American lives, and $$$.
Yeah with all prejudice red necks on the other side of it where they should be 
@burrbunch Don't believe it President Trump, someone is padding the #'s to take advantage of the American tax payers!
American taxpayers? I though Mexico was paying for it?
In a way they will, with the 20% tariff Trump is proposing...DUH!!
I don’t recall @realDonaldTrump  saying “in a way they will pay for it”, he said “will pay”.
They will pay! He never said they would pay the entire cost of it, just that they would pay.
"Mexico will pay for the wall 100%” Aug 2016 “[reimburse us] absolutely, 100 percent” Jan 2017
Cool, now look up what promises Obama broke! They all do it, so what! At least America will get money.
Nice deflection, but we aren't talking Obama anymore. We are talking about Trump lies.
More than the govt originally thought? You said it wouldn't cost anything bc Mexico would pay. If it costs $1 you're a liar
he said Americans will pay up front and then he will make Mexico pay if they want to do business in the states
No. During the campaign @realDonaldTrump said Mexico would pay for the wall. Period. Full stop.
and they will
Mexico is not going to pay. We are DJT will try and put that bill on our tab! He is a thug liar!
but you call trump a thug and liar get informed about your precious Mexico
I am informed just because other goverments and corrupt doesn't make it acceptable. he is a LIAR!
so your for making no ffort to stop the drugs coming in than and thousands of Mexicans used as human
ONLY You Can Save us
Aww, don't lie Donald- we all know you can't read.
The money we'll save in crime, it will pay for itself in a few years
Invest tax payer dollars in infrastructure You're so smart you don't pay taxes but I do #NoBanNoWall
BUILD THE WALL.
See if he'll give you a job to assist in the process 
Do It!!!
Maybe President Trump should check for hidden bugs(electronic) in the White House and the Capitol building.
President Trump
