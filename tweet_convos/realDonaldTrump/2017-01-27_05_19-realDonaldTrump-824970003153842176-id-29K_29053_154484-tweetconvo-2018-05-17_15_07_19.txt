Do you have any pics of the Wall? Must be great now after 5 months of speedy building Trump project.
but about US
los enemigos no son los latinos
If business men like you made their products in US - their Deficits wouldnt exist, there would be more$ in economy #makethingsinamericaagain
Americans are WORRIED about Corruption, Pay To Play, Quid Pro Quo, Treason, Law & Order, Our US Constitution, Rule Of Law, Our Democracy, CyberSecurity, Nat'l Security, Free Fair Elections, Separation of Powers, Justice System, Climate Change, Pollution, Green Energy, Health Care
Do you think Mr. Donald trump that Americans buy a tripled product in its price? Making a product in Mexico is 3 to 5 times cheaper than in the United States, if you cancel the matter they will have a car 5 times more expensive than before. in United States
@realDonaldTrump / I HAVE RECEIVED NOTICE FROM TWITTER THAT THEY BLOCK YOUR TWITTER SITE! I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

taco truck on every corner dream is dead
Renegotiate NAFTA. That can solve the border issue
flint still has lead pipes and undrinkable water. Can you fix that first please?
you do realize you make your suits in Mexico right?
Yes he does! Even he will rearrange his business to meet up new American standards that benefit USA.
but I thought he divested from all of his businesses and had no say anymore? 
he's supposed to... but he won't...
‚Äúvery weak border‚Äù
Was he supposed to say "very weak argument?"  #ImpeachTrump
"If there is a hard, high wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will stand on the side of the egg." Haruki Murakami.
God bless you for even thinking for a nanosecond that Donald might understand a poem.
I sense he needs more poetry in his life.

,  praying for a wall that will protect our people.

The wall is the answer. Let us Americans imigrate in masses to Mexico and see what the Mexican President action s will be

YOU KNOW WHO MUST CHANGE? OUR PRESIDENT! you know mexico and other countries aren't the ones affecting the society.
didn't know you also played the victim card. Poor u =( all that cheap labor. All the southwest land America calmed theirs.
I like the sound you make when you shut up.
I think I left my condoms at your mum's house last night.
@POTUS Give the crop jobs to prisoners.  Put them to work, no free rides on prisoners.
And no fellow american businessman has made one buck in businesses with or in Mexico. #SayNoToPropaganda
Baloney it was to the advantage of being good neighbours, you prefer special relations between Mexico and China?
@POTUS If i want a fence & my neighbor doesn't, I pay for the fence & put it on my side of the boundary.
@POTUS you are not making America's relationships great - Mexico, Germany, England etc., but certain that u r cool w/Russia
most Americans don't realize, w/ your stupid wall, tax/tariff will be passed to Americans. We'll pay 2xs 4 the wall.
yes. Sir
@POTUS haver si entendi quieres que el pais que se fue ala guerra con francia para no pagar unos pasteles te paguen el muro
Your lips keep moving but all I hear is ‚ÄúBlah, blah, blah.‚Äù
John Quincy Adams might of said he cant put the first eagle prob right next to Sherry Exploiser dreams I have
only people. who are hate full are against.  potus
you are a fool
you gonna make a country no one wants to be in?
I would ask how old you are, but I know you can't count that high.
. @realDonaldTrump At least Mexico has been fighting against fascists like your supporters and cabinet for years.
yep, definitely Mexico taking advantage, that bunch of rich fuckers... #nowall
Liar @TrumpLiar
Watch Obama he is working against you secretly!  He is stirring up anarchy with the help of Soros! Get AG on this!
hahahahahaha you are hilarious
go ahead and strengthen immigration but don't build a wall. Americans don't want to pay for it and neither do wildlife.
U have taken advantage of foreign workers by paying SLAVE wages for GOODS & SERVICES. U r a CROOK.
I Hate You Mr. Trump!
Is that your face? Or did your neck just throw up?
c√≥mo ves esto, Donald
i don't understand Trump
they don't like it to bad times are changing!!!üñí
yeah like cooking your fucking food
I just stepped in something that was smarter than you‚Ä¶ and smelled better too.
@POTUS Trump Mexico just played you.
Aww, it‚Äôs so cute when you try to talk about things you don‚Äôt understand.
but don't most of our goods come from Mexico and isn't the border your biggest "conflict" not Mexico's
if you had educated yourself to facts you would know this statement is "alternative facts" come dude!
We will save money by not paying for medical care for all the babies born here. Their crimes and gangs need to go back where they came from
amen
 Viva the Resistance!
tell us again Donny boy where your suits are manufactured? Mexico??????
Please, keep talking. I always yawn when I am interested.
You have taken advantage of the US for too long.  You have cost us more than Mexico in your 70 years! #OldFartP*ssyGrabber


you take us all the way past great
So now all of our food imports will be too expensive?@ilovemexicanavocados
you do business with mexico your clothing line made there who is taking advantage
oh Mr. President please explain how. We want the juicy details
how many Mexicans work in your hotels that u will benefit from as President? Provide proof you employ no Mexicans first!
And the first war, with our own neighbor, is underway. Right on schedule according to your massive meltdowns. #saveavocados
Sound,clear,fair immigration laws will protect Mexican workers in the USA from labor exploitation.
Real issue is respecting our laws and ICE and Border Patrol enforcing laws, Mexico Govt. Helps with that enforcement.
c√°mbiame est√° carnal //
@POTUS  Actually it's American company paying for the wall and finally American citizen will pay for it.
@POTUS Mexico found the cutest nickname for you Stay tuned.....La Cucaracha Naranja Gigante 
stop now.
pay for the wall yourself! You lied, just admit it for once. Increase the taxes for your supporters, not everyone! No wall
Go to Mexico! Maybe you'll not be sent to prison or worse.
thanks for spending my money twice on something that has no meaning to me.    How about making them tax paying citizens?
Don't take it personally against Mexico, if you lost businesses was YOUR fault, not Mexico's .I see why you love Russia...
@POTUS you have taken advantage of us for too long even before you became someone else's potus so did ur father and gfarhwr
Wah-...! Ah-...! 
...Mexico and America have one of the most militarized borders between two countries at peace, guy!
Annex Mexico !
Them gd Mexicans ever since the Alamo they beed sticking it to us - go for it big man!
start charging them a fee of $2.00 for every dollar they send to Mexico and that should cover the wall
Totally. Remember how they came into the US and built your McMansions for less than minimum wage?
Everyone knows ur Lying. Believe me very true..
ojala en Venezuela  el presidente dijera que va a mandar a hacer un muro entre colombina y Venezuela.
you have it all wrong we have trade deficit cause we don't produce good they need
how any Mexicans have you got Working for you?
Slander and bashing at your neighbours & weakening their economy is not going to make America great again or stop migration
‚ô´ You can't build the wall, your hands are too small. ‚ô™
You have zero capacity for understanding world, let alone Mexico. You already lost America.
anda pues pato ya no se exportara el AGUACATE haber como le haces para calmar a los amantes del aguacate
Taken advantage? Are you sure?

Stupid idea.
if you want to really punish them, go be their president.
they couldn't have taken advantage if we didn't let them so it is bad negotiation
