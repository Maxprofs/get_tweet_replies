"looks like he does his the president" Ahem. Last I checked he's not president of the world
Bullshit. You're a threat to all of humanity, not just America and what it stands for. #resist
As a teacher, I expect the POTUS to be grammatically correct in speech and writing. You, sir, need a proofreader.
haters
@Ptarrago212 @NBCNews your doing a great job!! Go Trump!!!
Your hair is in the wind...lol 
STOP TWEETING ABOUT NUKES YOU IRRESPONSIBLE TWIT. #NotPresidential #NotMyPresident
So Molly you weren't in on ANY WH briefs but u know more than PEOTUS??  Nice try...
if you can't see why peotus shouldn't tweet about nukes, you're a twit.
Thanks, she blocked me from telling her she's a twit. ;-)
Literally every word you communicate betrays the tragic stupidity of the electorate.  #resist
just a small alternative fact.  Don't worry about "fake" news.
LEAVE SUCH TWEETS TO KELLYANNE
SHE IS GRACIOUS IN BARKING BACK
AND SHE SMILES WHILE DOI G IT
Feel free to use as needed...Sure there'll be plenty of opportunities.
#TrumpCantSpell #DontBeDumb #MinorityLeader
For God's sake, use the freaking spell check! We already know you're IGNORANT, no need to keep proving it!
How do you know he wrote it you Kumquat ?!? Killery said it best !!!
No one knows more about spelling than I do!!!!!
Maybe you need to come to your senses you dope
America elected an illiterate sexual predator.
Um, don't want to nitpick but, first, it is "quote" and second, you are president now so check before you hit send
And third, every time you talk about "nukes" you are freaking us out, ok?
Biased media is NOT journalism!

Only watch Varney, Lou, Hannity Watters, Pirro then I skip over 2 the internet for real news.
you only want news that conforms to your personal bias.  That is not intelligent
Not a sheep of the msm anymore. I will pray you find your way too.
yeah don't pray for me.  Don't need your silly superstitions.
I expect nothing but the lowest from @NBCNews
they did not leave that quote out.   He is lying.
Ok, fair enough, so what do you mean by "until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes"? 
the best is you will Release the video with that part then there is proof @Schlueri @NBCNews
Please mention the POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sir! #Anstand  @NBCNews
i don't think he will read my Tweet so I am safe
I think Sir @realDonaldTrump will read every tweet!  @NBCNews
Wow, Trump! You sure do have a lot of followers as you claimed! But...are you reading your tweets from your "followers?! Ha
He takes things out of context all the time. ALL THE TIME! Manipulative bully.
You don't like the media why spend so much time pulling up their quotes stating their misquoting why don't you do press conference
@EvilGnome6 @NBCNews
a very significant qualification
thank you  for  saving America
Part of world coming to it's senses would be the POTUS not advocating nuclear proliferation.
Meaningless quote to omit.
Any statement regarding nuclear weapons as President-elect on Twitter is threatening no matter how you wrote it.
So increasing nuclear arms will help the world to come to its senses? Mistaken!
Ah, this is a middle-school error: you MUST proofread. What do typos do to your credibility? See: qoute, above.
it sounds less stupid without that sentence
'Qoute'?? Why do you insist on ignoring spellcheck?
Don't you think tweeting thoughts on nuclear anything is irresponsible?  Some topics need to be excluded from Twitter!!!

NEVER USE NUKES. Muh Precedent.
you say so much f ing crap it is hard to keep up
Mr Presendent thy can't get over you your the greatis

Trump Inaugural Music Lineup:

1. The distant echo of sobbing children
2. A raccoon knocking over a trash can…
Can we quote your "qoute"?
Somebody help poor Trump understand what the 'race' part of 'arms race' means.
Q. U. O. T. E.  And he's been reported. GET THE HELL OFF TWITTER! Try adulting. You MAY find you like it.
they suck

mate, you've got to get off twitter.  Seriously.  Please.
keep up the tweets and telling the American people the truth. Media won't. Dont stop! Happy to have you as potus!
thank you sir.  Less than a week and your the potus! Cant wait.  Most Americans cant wait . #maga
don't even speak to them, communicate directly
merry Xmas
get over yourself! Are u new to u.s. news?  Ya it's manipulated, your gonna have to grow thicker skin if u plan to
Just like u have left out their part now. Honest too. 
Don Millions of people already hate you...no amount of inane tweeting is going to change that.
actually they did say that. Stop being a wuss
Here's a part YOU left out: #TrumpTaxReturns. Your Tweets make it clear you're falling apart. #YouGetWhatYouPutin
oh, that makes all the difference.
How cruel of them, Donny. They just don't realise how great an intellect they're dealing with. Shame on them.
Chuck Norris will fear you.
Why does my dog keep barking
we herd you. Drain them
May GOD ALMIGHTY shower you and your loved ones with blessings in your new journey, good luck anf FV<€ nbc.
you are an #idiot we do not need #POTUS putting the US in this position. We do not need an #armsrace @NBCNews is a puppet
50 years of sensible people trying to reduce the Nukes in the world and along comes trump talking "sense..."  @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews
That's why you should not talk. If you don't talk you won't get misquoted. Then the world will be more civilized.
It just makes you look like a bottom.
happy Christmas Donny! Have a great day. Love to your family. #keepitreal
very dishonest
The world has already come to its senses with non-proliferation treaties. You are trying to fuck that up why?
quote* don't worry, spelling is very difficult. Especially those challenging five letter words.
We got it though, people that want the truth know how to find it, people that want lies, reject the truth!
how about you lead by example with responsible policies and use your friendship with Putin to start disarming together
here, I found it! #RIPAmerica
he is so prophetic
He's the BEST at being pathetic.
No one is more pathetic than him
Not a single person. Bigly.
well apart from Clinton who managed to loose the same election 3x
2.8 million people
.@realDonaldTrump Honey, I don't know what's happened to your self esteem since the popular vote but you need to buck up and President.
.@realDonaldTrump And let this be a lesson about how when you're the President everything you say about "nukes" will be scrutinized, angel.
Honey when u have liberal media twist his words at every chance it doesnt matter. theres a safe space for u
Aw - powerless Trump boy hates when the big media meanies tear daddy president apart for saying dumb dumbs.
did ur head explode when Trump won? say President Trump for the next 8 years
u maybe right. obama has ruined the country to the pt it may not recover but Trump can do it
You will never turn us against our free press.  NEVER.
I'm sorry, but Fascism is the marriage of State and Corporate power.  Does anything more aptly describe this man?
That, PLUS his lawsuit rampage against the free press...What have we done here?  THIS is what "Great Again" means?
know what you did. You thought Trump would be easier to defeat. #NeverTrump  @NBCNews
I thought the American people would be harder to manipulate.  #sobering
Rubio drank water and it was scandalous. Thanks for Trump. #NeverTrump @NBCNews
And sorry, no.  The self-described "Party of Personal Responsibility" doesn't get to blame ME for YOUR vote.
Barking up the wrong tree! #nevertrump @NBCNews
In all likelihood, this tweet will be deleted and reposted due to the misspelling.
but it wasn't. Which means either he hasn't noticed (which is bad) or he doesn't care about mistakes (bad)
#TrumpFraud #StillWithHer #PUTINGATE #trumpgrets #TrumpleThinSkin #TheResistance #TreasonousTrump #TrumpTrainCRASH
@kamrananwar1973 @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews it could get serious as more show disdain 4 Trumputin; he may literally go nuclear
Hmmm....what will the affluenza child choose ?!
You mean the President-elect who defeated the lesser candidates?
Trump was elected by 19% of the American people. It's a loss.
Yes, Democracy has lost . Russia has won ...sieg heils y'all 
shut the fuck up. It's christmas. You're the president. Shut, the fuck, UP
you're a war monger. Give it up.
he is a wanna be war profiteer! Despicable!
It's literally in the third paragraph you nincompoop @realDonaldTrump
Couldn't read that far.
I voted for you but please stop tweeting.
please stop voting...
pretty crazy you dummies lost, right?
Yeah...WE are the dumb ones....How do you like those upcoming SS and Medicare cuts champ?
has it happened yet friend?And yeah Obamacare needs to change. Who can afford 14k deductible?
Pot calling the kettle black.
I HOPE YOU CAN HAVE THAT HEALTHCARE BILL READY TO GO ! MAKE SURE YOU HAVE RYAN PUSH EVERYTHING THRU BEFORE DEMS BLOCK YOU !
Aren't you the one who said "bomb their families"? (Yes, it's on record, you did.) Senses indeed.
That is DISGUSTING.  The media cannot be trusted and we've all known it for a long long time.  Time to get real!!!
Why nukes should never be used again Responsibility.
@realDonaldTrump  https://youtu.be/arONMWblvG8 

NBC like CNN is creating news...not reporting it.
It doesn't make sense when we already have more weapons and bombs than we will ever need.
And how will we know when the world comes to its senses, and who decides?
@SFL4Hillary @NBCNews you misspelled quote... smh #DumfusRejectPrez
WRONG. The real news got it right.
Already propaganda machine spewing out anti-Trump snipits....
keep your mouth shut and hands off the button
No one listens to NBC ANYMORE!!How do they keep their sponsors? Soros can't hold up a sinking ship forever!
@cmrudy  I CAUGHT THAT Such Bias I ignore mainstream news. I Trust my new president & say good riddance 2 the last
I'm guessing that last word "Dishonest" was you signing the tweet?
I don't watch or listen to that crap anyway so no worries on this end,
Wow, qoute - is that Russian for nukes?
I hope the media continues to expose the truth in your being unfit to be president
...and this is why we need you too keep using social media. Give us your side of things! For shame @NBCNews

(#flipadistrict;)
The only dishonest liar we're lookin at is you. Stop thinking you're fooling anyone.
Well you sure know about dishonesty.
The world knows the power of the nukes. Jesus Christ.
When will the "world comes to its senses"?  When every developed country has 1 million nukes?  Tell me, smart guy.

Do you even know what kind of crap you've tweeted? Are you aware those tweets don't disappear?
The full quote is in the article here: http://tinyurl.com/hffacjf  Your tweet is still reckless even in context.
Dishonest is you, going back on your stated nuclear policy. They're media; you're the next Pres. God help us
dishonest press
All MSM are a real sewage these days... I hope them drained soon and replaced by some more honest platforms.
Trump knows dishonesty
how are you boss
your a liar!
. @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews So the Spin Doctors told you to to say. Why does the phrase Spin Doctors exist? Ronnie Reagan. Déjà vu.
yeah, but we read it on Twitter and it's STILL disgusting!
DJT purposely included the word purposely in his tweet even though he has NO IDEA if NBC did it on purpose. Liar.
statements within 24hrs of each other
i saw that in all the news reports. What are you talking about?!!!
SPELLING...stupid
Spell check Donnie
They have been right from the start They think we are stupid wrong !!!!
They left out the most coherent part! @NBCNews should learn real news from the experts: Infowars, Breitbart, & the Onion
lets start with 9/11
Just like they are purposely paying you for Apprentice? And they purposely lightened your image on Fallon & SNL?
For us who grew up in the cold war era. You are scary...End the World.
the mainstream media is always dishonest when it comes to you. Good thing I watch Fox.
HOW does expanding nuclear programs make things better? Only need to blow us up once. Together we can blow it 10!
I believe the word you are looking for is "quote". 
Well Trump before tge world come to their senses you have be the first one. If he do not know nuke kill and end
Old news. No NY-business slice and dice. Do what is necessary and be quiet. Serious people don't care.
It was left out because you never said it. Who do you think you're fooling? Oh ya, your low IQ supporters.
it doesn't matter, even with that added you are still irresponsible and reckless for making that statement
what? Like.....do you even watch the news?
Remember when you didn't know abt the Nuclear Triad? We do! http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/12/17/what-is-nuclear-triad-debate-sot.cnn … #TaxReturns
it wasn't left out .  Stop complaining, wait until you're president. You haven't seen anything yet
Evidently NBC News has more political savvy than you do. Get an intelligence briefing.
