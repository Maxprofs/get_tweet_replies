Trump's waving "rigged" & voter fraud banner is where he's especially disgraceful as undermines civic confidence
In basic terms, he also puts off his own voters with these claims, shhh, don't tell him. @RJDownard @realDonaldTrump
amongts the core Kulturkampf Trumpistas, they tend to accept such demagogery as fact @PumaBare @realDonaldTrump
@Coockie690 Of course ! Why I didn't think about it before ? I'm so stupid !
Yes you're stupid
Only trump tell the truth
Vote for him to defeat crooked hillary
Sorry father to be a FRENCH PERSON ! ;_;

They are not in denial,they're nt niave either.Most Rep pols dont wnt u 2 be #POTUS. This election is rigged on both sides.
the big P***y baby losing in the polls and now has to save face by claiming the process is rigged. Go home, you're Drunk!
why are we as tax payers paying for Obama and wife to travel and campaign for the democrats?
almost no real cases of voter fraud. It is a false threat perpetuated by Republicans to disenfranchise Dem leaning voters
And of course you have proof of this, right? Or do your supporters believe you anyway? So naïve! #factsmatter
have you gotten any response about adding you to a "list" for speaking agenst trump?
Do you mean has anyone asked to add me to a list? I'm unclear of your question, sorry.
ok . I got a response after a negative message I sent about trump. My next response. Now you're on my list . seems hostile?
Yep, that seems hostile. I'd block whomever said that to me. And yes, I've been added to lists by Trumpers but I block them.
thanks for your help
Thirty-one instances of in-person voter fraud out of 1 billion votes cast between 2000-2014. Why in DJT so stupid? SAD!
What a coincidence: your fantasy # of fraudulent votes (3,000,000) equals the # by which you lost the general. Sad!
And the first person arrested for voter fraud VOTED FOR YOU TWICE! Rampant indeed! @tlchimes @GeorgeTakei @beerluvr2
you influenced this in your rallies


why is it always rigged when you don't get your way? You're acting like a 2 yr old!!! #stopwhining
not just voter fraud, all media. SXMU DJ's as well as many others are rallying against you.
21 days until you lose badly!
Nov 28th is your Court Hearing for scamming College Kids! 
Dec 13th you'll face RAPE Charges
if Democrats could "rig" the election, we'd have a Dem Senate and a Dem House! @MadYellowDog @HillaryClinton
.@realDonaldTrump of course. Where?
Sowing the seeds of anger.....this is why you will never be more than a suit!!
Its not the @GOP's fault! #BillyBushMadeMeDoIt
The GOP deny voter fraud because they will ignore anything to silence the peoples voice.
@JordyAri Hillary's Greed for Power & Money will destroy our country. Why WE MUST VOTE for TRUMP! #WomenWhoVoteTrump
study shows only possible 37 cases of fraud out of 1 billion votes.   Wide Spread???
voter intimidation is a felony GOP has been suppressing the vote anyway #cheater #racist #dictator
The two words every Trump supporter fears: Prove it.
.            There is a postal worker in Ohio who is tweeting about destroying early voting mailings for Donald trump
That's a parody account. Take more fish oil.
I'm new to twitter so forgive me for not knowing a lot of things but this is a real twitter link.
i love working at the post office in Columbus, Ohio and ripping up absentee ballots that vote for trump
And not everything on Twitter is real. This is someone pretending, to embarrass people paranoid enough to believe them.
Though sometimes, in the wee small hours, I have my doubts. Maybe, maybe, I am the fraud. #FoodForThought 
@MissD4Trump they need to do away with absentee ballots unless you are military. Makes it too easy for dead people to vote
@HillaryClinton @DNCWomen @MomsThoughts .I am casting my vote for Hillary Clinton.I live in suburbs  of  Philly.
#MyVote
GO TRUMP= wINNING!!!!
Classic silly childish behavior. Things don't go your way, so push all the game pieces on the floor.  #wheresyourbinky
They are "leaders" at least. You are simply a follower. 75 more hours. Bye bye.
It's a one party system Donald.  They know!
More of your supporters arrested for voter fraud we know you are the one rigging it.

VOTE TRUMP... SO LIFE CAN BEGIN...

@blackdeplorable 

GLOBALISTS.
@TrumpPatriot4 they deny it because they are part of corruption & don't want to get caught, YOU KNOW THAT BUT CAN'T SAY IT
@KellyannePolls Your campaign manager looks like she's not getting any sleep!  Bags under eyes. Not grope worthy!
- voter fraud?....."wah!" Says big orange crybaby
Millions of Americans See it Also, People who don't are Fools
I went to a voting training today. The real fraud is our media and actual voter registration. Need to change that pronto
Yes, where are the Republican leaders defending the integrity if the polls? Rubio gets it. @realDonaldTrump
You are Change. Tell the voters it's time to play their "Trump Card" and change the game.  Held card long enough.
.@realDonaldTrump = #NutJob
you are acting like a sore loser and you haven't even lost yet. Project much?
Trump was the kid who flipped over the game board, when he realized his loss was inevitable.
@lizdolan most repubs are right there in bed with them Donald . expose them please
你们呀，naive!
Real leaders don't make excuses.
Hey @realDonaldTrump - #Fact #1: voter impersonation finds 31 credible incidents out of one billion ballots cast! @WashingtonPost #debate
#StopWhining
talking like a loser!
Better than talking like a rapist..
please go back to the speeches that won you the nomination! We don't need this other crap and fraud, we wanna win not lose
No, sir, there isn't.  Come to our polls and see for yourself. #democracyworks
delete your account and crawl back into your basket!
you have absolutely no proof. Loser
stop whining
Get lost LOSER!!
why are you spending valuable time fighting your own party and obsessing about things that keep you off message?!
.@realDonaldTrump I've had it with you. You are not going to invalidate my vote or this campaign. Hopefully, I'll see you in court.
as a poll worker, that offends me you big headed old fart
yea it's called storing completed absentee ballots at NCGOP. Maybe u need to answer ?'s abt that. THAT's ILLEGAL.
Mr Trump - I suppose there is no chance of anything other than bullshit coming from your mouthpiece
Why haven't you reported your evidence for this to election officials? Or to anyone?
@realdonaldtrump
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37684418?ocid=socialflow_twitter … terrible to think that a campaign could use underhand tactics!
"I would invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go make his case to get votes." —@POTUS
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
.@realDonaldTrump #CrookedDonald such a dishonest and insecure #Loser. After Nov 8 you will be know as #LoserTrump.
I truly hope people can see through the brainwashing of the media, and vote for America. Vote for Trump!
one word ACORN??? Also who obomo worked for.
Watching your meltdown has been massively entertaining. It's the best, believe me,  *gestures crazily*
is a big fat orange tinged baby. Trump is losing cause he could never shut his big fat yap & stop bragging. So insecure!
in bed with clinton..ewww..have her arrested when you become commander in chief. .
You are the real voter fraud in this election.
Anyone heard of ACORN? Putting Hilary in the White House is NOT smart!!!
would solve the problem of people voting more then once.. or dead people for that matter....
not naive but stupid because they do know and aren't doing anything about it they took the oath they're Liars
Where's your evidence? You have none! Another Fact Free statement from the Lyin King!
probably...because...it's not happening....this is just because your...you know...loosing 
@ish10040 we are turning out the vote in YUGE numbers! Focus on issues Mr. Trump!
U are so right: Rexnord Corp. telling its 295 Indianapolis employees that they plan to move its plants to Mexico ...!
Only when you are lossing, why do you lie so much
cant wait to see you lose in 3 weeks...ill be drinking your tears for wine..
meow
you are such a bully! You are so rigged realDonaldTrump
USA is good at elections.  Fraud is a crime.  U r creating histeria.  Dangerous.  BAD AND SAD.  U r fired.
You know, things may not go your way. That's called #democracy. Not fraud. And people don't have to be crocked to disagree
I have the opportunity to vote twice. An absentee ballot I just received from my old voting State and my current one.
You are the fraud! You are the Division! You are the Evil ! You have end of world mentality like Islamic Terrorists!!!
you're a clown, dog. Just stop already.
Because voter fraud in the U.S. is a myth.  #Rigged #JustTheFacts #ImWithHer #TrumpPence16 #Election2016 #factcheck2016
in your rigged mind
- Once you are POTUS we need to clean house in Rep. party to get rid of the leeches, starting with Paul Ryan!!!!
You're not losing because of voter fraud. You're losing because YOU'RE a fraud.
This is a lie
The way you're acting so pathetic and scared of the coming loss, by building an excuse, means you'll be grabbing yourself
Because I am sorry to say, that our so called "Republican Leaders" are now part of the problem. #GoRedNov8  #MAGA
In this case, why bother running?  Quit. You're going to lose anyway.
@MousseauJim Thats how they got Bush in. Remember Florida!
you already have us. Get the left with something they would like. Throw them a bone. Maybe they will let go of Hillary.
People still believe in Trump, So naive! #neverTrump
you are the most dangerous clown.
Of course there is a demigod feeding the uneducated masses his imagined delusions designed to fend off his own shame.
Not naive, foolish and evil!
@Kittens4milk the problem is GOP must have 100% proof before they will open their mouthAnd we all know no such thing as100%
The Repub leaders know exactly what's going on. Lou Dobbs has been reporting this and I believe him
I speak 2 HILLARY voters as a lifetime Dem who quit the party after they stole the primary from Bernie: $222mL in donations
because they are all ass kissers and just go with the flow instead of taking action.
If you can imagine Philadelphia has 100% voter turn out for democrats every election? Fraud, big time..
Rigged??  Because they're not sore losers like the Donald. At least Mike Pence is respectful about the inevitable outcome.
@GigiTracyXO
.@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you hadn't pissed off Jeb Bush, he could've rigged the vote for you in Florida like he did 4 his brother. Sad!
@Trumpertarian Also talk abt you being an agent ofCHANGE! Talk abt open borders, Free trade.Dontlook defensive!Be offensive
@michellesnodgr1 
Not naive. Self interests reign. GOP wnts 2 remain in status quo comfort zone.Dont care 4 AmerVoter
good point!   They bury their heads, so stop complaining about not getting things done. Grow a pair repubs!
@TheEllenShow The only voter fraud there is, is you running the Rep. party into the dirt Donald Trump. So NAIVE!
Yea why isnt anybody else inciting riots and mayhem?Cause ur a nut whos ego wont let u admit defeat so u falsely yell fraud
#America .vs. #trump

#Debate

#Integrity #Trust:
#GOP Voters DON'T Believe #DonaldTrump

OUCH!

@realdonaldtrump
GOP is banned from investigating any Voter Fraud by the RNC Consent Decree. New Judges needed.
the only fraud is Donald Trump.
so if you win (God forbid!) we will remember your words "election is rigged"
This os Trumps way to admit he is going to lose
The world waits breathlessly for the proof that backs up your allegations...Is it in the same file as the birther claims?
Your GOP buddies keep their voter fraud on the down low naive one.
are you a sore loser? #NeverTrump
need help with an unrigged election? Bring in these guys. They helped Nepal, Iraq, Congo, Sudan.   http://www.un.org/undpa/en/elections …
you have your brother Putin to screw up elections
-- Because you make it up in your little Trump mind does not make it true.
, give us evidence from multiple sources or stop destroying our democracy and slipping ochlocracy.
#DumpTrump #DefeatTrump
.@realDonaldTrump *citation needed*
.@realDonaldTrump Given your history of telling falsehoods, can you provide any evidence to support this startling allegation?
I don't suppose the fact you're the absolute worst candidate in history has anything to do with your impending massive loss
stop lying to the American people. There is no voter fraud going on.
@Dauby5910 The proof is here: https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY 
One can't say, "Every vote matters" & "There's not enough voter fraud to make a difference."

They're mutually exclusive.
watch the absentee voting in all states....dems way of cheating!!!
GOPe is rife with treasonous globalists- not surprised they shield fellow globalist Hillary, Ryan, etc
@wiltonmommy agree 100% MAGA
Does rigged voting explain why Republicans hold majority in Senate, House and State governors? .@realDonaldTrump
.@realDonaldTrump I may have hurt chances to work at the Trump News Network. If I delete tweets, can I host The Chemtrails Fluoride Hour?
if you say it, you have to prove it and you can't
Naïve or complicit with the latter being more likely.
Bc they're part of it.
@bonnieblue719 Are we doing anything about it? We cannot just talk about it!
I am so upset with the house and Senate, letting corruption run rampant. Instead of KGB we have RHC.
HRC
BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN REALITY and they're not looking for excuses, unlike you, trying to already cover your certain LOSS.
because thats how the enemy tries to hem you up for a lynching. Nobody buys this shit anymore.
