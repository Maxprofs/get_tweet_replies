More lies...Hello Pinocchio Trump
And you want to be President to off your lawsuits  @HillaryClinton
and you probably owe that or more in taxes. 

Might want to do your math again.  How big a debt from Bush did he have to clear up first???
I love how you don't have the balls to tag Obama, I'll do it for you @BarackObama
HOW MUCH AND WHOM DO YOU OWE. THE DEVIL FOR SURE. SHOW THE TOTAL TAX RETURNS
Not sure you can tweet while debating #Debates   RT @realDonaldTrump: .@HillaryClinton and Obama policies ... http://tmi.me/1fgdDp 
That is certainly the truth
.....Coming from a man that is MILLIONS & MILLIONS in debt.  LOL when did he start caring abt debt?
But you don't pay taxes and things have to get done. Someone needs to pay, when YOU don't.
and your tax plan would do far more than that
CHECK YOUR FACTS 'THE DONALD'. RELEASE ALL OF YOUR TAX RETURNS
