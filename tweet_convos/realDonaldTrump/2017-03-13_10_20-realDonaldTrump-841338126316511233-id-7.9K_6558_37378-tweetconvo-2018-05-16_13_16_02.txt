I would be good if the whole damn thing was just repealed .I will take care of me. not a handout...
Healthcare wasn't a problem when founders lived. Where have you been? We've advanced!
I'm not interested in your government "advancement"..I am not a socialist. Never will be.
What do you even know about it other than your side's sound bites of how awful it is?
before ACA 235mo 1500 ded, after 590mo 8900 ded , then no one excepted the plan. About covers it
Thought you wouldn't take a handout? Didn't you plan?
Get it? Or too hard to follow?
No just got bored with your anecdotal information.
LOVE THAT SLOGAN. REPEAL AND REPLACE PAUL RYAN! Godless man.
Cant  have HC plan affordable without requiring everyone to buy. Basic insurance principle of sharing risk!
NOT WHAT YOU PROMISED! ITS TERRIBLE. BAD FOR AMERICANS.
wish you'd listen to US... Just #repealobamacare then let the free market work :-D
Bunch of BS. Never was a free market with health ins. Oh & refuse SSI & Med when ur eligible.
Not going to refuse what I've paid for, and we Did have free market Health Care just not Insurance
Did you like #March4Trump ?

Thanks for info. Had muted you now unmuted
... We were denied medicade once again, your federal employee said....
I know you know what we were told.  ACA 600/ mo , 9 k deductible.  Please hurry up with something better.
UR probably in a state with a governor who didn't allow for Med expansion. Majority like it!
Do away with Obama Executive Order making government employees exempt for the ACA. It's only far!
Healthcare workers,in addition to execs,on the front line of healthcare, know many ways to cut costs.Ask
I don't see any working poor in that crowd.  why not listen to their views on ACA?


But if you win the lottery and fortunately become a 1%, they want to kick you out of the Act...
Psalm 33:12
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, The people He has chosen as His own [1/2]
kill all the poor and brown people! Amirite?!
Did @realDonaldTrump mention how he once deprived his grandnephew, who had cerebral palsy, of health insurance?
So if he does it to a relative, imagine poor people who are not related..He DORS NOT CARE #TRUMPCARE
Oops mess up up ..HE DON'T CARE!!

Whatever. Show us your tax returns and tell us about any conversations with the Russians. #SpecialProsecutor
Only single payer system will work best!!!!
did u listen. I doubt it. #Trumpcarestinks #trumpcare
sick of listening to your BS! BTW did you turn in the evidence for the so called #wiretap ???
#MondayMotivation
Even the HOSPITAL LOBBYISTS think this is a bad bill. #Trumpcare
Hey, really looking forward to that wire-tapping info you are gonna give to the acting AG today. LOL.
@SpeakerRyan's whole Powerpoint presentation could have just been this one slide. #Trumpcare
Or this one slide would have worked, too. #Trumpcare
.@AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD @SpeakerRyan this missed one step.  "invest in HSA" with cash you don't likely have

roflmao 
Trump= most productive president!!!
Don't you think you should have had the healthcare listenening session BEFORE you wrote policy to destroy healthcare?
The only listening you do is to the rich.
If he truly cared about the people he would listen to the people, not the CEOs of ins. companies.
Indivi     sible?
Prop people. Make crap idiot fred dropped on his little head feel big. More peeps there than inauguration.
we should listen though the Whitehouse microwave ovens!
the only thing Obamacare is bad for are rich people and insurance companies, that's why they hate it! FYDT
but wait! #whoislistenting ?
And after this, the ignoring the people who need it session.
please get rid of the mandate to carry insurance!
Listen to common people. Folks who have families, bills, food & can't pay high premiums & high deductibles.
Why aren't you listening to the millions Obamacare helped? You just stack deck in your favor. Sad.
Good luck. I hope you can eliminate more unnecessary benefits like orthodontia and health club memberships.
Another lie with Trumpcare. 24 million poor people uninsured.  Trump just can't keep his word-Lie lie lie!
Republicans believe Ryan is making a FOOL of Trump AHCA by destroying medicaid. We think he is too!
YES! But aren't these POLITICALLY CORRECT tweets with their links and lack of CAPSLOCK a little BORING?
I mean we could be going off about SERIOUS issues like MICROWAVE OVENS that SPY on people!
Or a nice recap about why Arnold totally FAILED at everything including his greatest challenge: THE APPRENTICE!
Or the ACADEMY AWARDS! Don't get us started on those! ALL LIES, and not a SINGLE award for us! BAD!
Instead of giving that STRAIGHT TALK (yes, that includes: no homo) we have to sit here and do what POLITICIANS do!
All the while that brilliant guy STEVE KING is out there spreading knowledge about BABIES and stealing OUR ideas!
geez Chris you might be the most mentally ill person on twitter.
BIG mistake @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD MASSIVE HUGE. Listening?To who?Not #TrumpTrain w/ $1k/mnth MANDATED TAX

@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD
U guys not being honest, everyone knows it. You can't have a repeal in the same bill as replace.#healthcare
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD
We love u Donald, but backed in the corner. LIFT THE HEALTHCARE TAX! #CleanRepeal http://bit.ly/2nfQvke 
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD
Paul Ryan authored bill financing 300k muslims & brokered deal selling #ICANN. We begged him not to do it. 
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD
#Ryancare will hit rural areas REALLY hard. 62-yr-old will pay $20,000 fr coverage instead of $760.
who said????
.@realDonaldTrump The one with the "victims" of Obamacare? All 8 of them? Your plan isn't a plan and people are going to die.

lmao!!!  love this 
These are crazy times.
you got that right!! Pretty scary stuff going on...
You've got that right. I've been pretty scared since Jan 20th.
me too...I guess we will see what happens with #trumputin and Russia. I'm not distracted 
My ADD kicks in. With this circus I need some horse blinders. #Trumprussia
THEN LISTEN!!!
Trump you're a loser and get your we don't want no part of you business in America and Canada
Don't listen to Paul Ryan & stop embracing his healthcare plan. You made promises to the people: No cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Soc. Sec.
All he does is lie, lie, lie!!
and there ain't nothing we can do about it. What a shame. Only reason I voted for you
He was a life long Dem & said that if he ever ran 4 Pres, he'd run as a Repub cause "ppl will believe everything he says."
Presidents before you actually used that desk for work, instead of a prop for a photo op.  Pretty sure you did not #readthebill
Why are you letting Pelosie & Mueller rule you. We want what you promised..
Disgraceful American president
Donald great job, Christian, or Muslim, we come from the same God, The God of Abraham.  We're brothers, in the pursuit of freedom.
CAN WE GET HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AMERICANS EQUALLY LIKE CONSTITUTION SAYS TO. HOUSING. JOBS, DENTAL, FOOD AND UTILITIES LIKE YOU/H.R./CONGRESS
Americans need Health Insurance...quit bickering and do your job.
Healthcare listening session w/ @VP &amp; @SecPriceMD. Watch: http://45.wh.gov/wmwewc  #ReadTheBill:… https://t.co/1cQI0Z...
Stay out of Syria,  it was done to deflect, rices investigation, politics have never changed. Slowdown.
Listening?? To who?? Certainly not the American people!!! 23 million will lose coverage but none of the GOP care!!
as long as hospitals and doctors are corporations there will and can never be healthcare.
I voted for you, Donald, because my health is gone, immune system GONE. NO HELP FROM DOCS.
you got lied to im sorry
Patients are dying from DOCTOR abuse, neglect AND illegal regulations.
if that plan passes millions will die is that better? And rich get tax cuts
Ocare is garbage/bad docs (!) AND a tax. New plan MUST address ALL.
Listening? Okay - The bad news: 24 million Americans lose coverage. The good news: you'd get a tax break if you paid taxes.
fantastic sounds like an incentive to get a job.
Dear @Nocupcakeshere leroy says he's tired of his blue state taxes supporting red state faux rugged individuals. Me, I'm not a working breed
I'm tired of my taxes funding anything. Maybe I'll join the party and get free crap too. Blue state resident but bleed red.
Oh leroy's just tired of footing the bill for folks who take way more than they give and still complain they're over-taxed.
me too Leroy's dog. Me too.
Remember how you kept using the CBO to attack popular vote-winning President Obama? I'll remind you:
Trump is not the one selling the new plan, it is #RyanTheRat he hates @POTUS
You mean @realDonaldTrump didn't have a clue about #Trumpcare and now Ryan has to do it?
No, I have faith that Trump will renegotiate as we voice our disapproval.
I hope you are right. If not, tens of thousands of Americans will die.
The Obamacare model must go. It's literally killing many of us. #Repeal
No, it's saving lives and improving US healthcare, which is terrible.
You are talking to the wrong person. I live this nightmare daily for 4 yr
TRUMP ISN'T THE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE. HE IS THE PRESIDENT FOR THE RICH & PUTIN. IF THE POOR DIE THATS OK
If you listen 2 victims of ACA, you should also listen 2 people who ACA has benefited. The same for stats on immigrant crime AND homegrown.
perhaps listen to THE PEOPLE you represent
missed your deadline.  #FakeNewsAlert  the deflector potus saved racists job by slandering exports. #resign
want to hear more about Rand Paul's healthcare plan please!!!
to
Yo momma was like a racecar driver. She burns lots of rubbers!
Half of my medications that I have been on for years,  are not covered by my insurance anymore #canyoufix
24 million to lose their healthcare!! Also you havent donated your wages, or proven the wiretap bs. LIAR
Charge 1% deduction from all paycheck 's to help those that cain't afford insurance to get it.
The American people want the same healthcare Congress has.
have you listened in any other topic - anti-semitism?  7 threats yesterday.  Your silence is complicit
Let Obamacare fester for a while, many more will see how bad it is. Do other work, Wall, taxes, defence
Do it right. Low premiums and low deductibles. It's what your base voted for
I don't know how to get a hashtag trending, but  #GOPdeathplan is accurate.  700% cost increase on old and sickly.
Only 4 women, guess the rest were in the washroom
Or they were too afraid to move in closer to Pres Gropey for a photo. How close would you stand?
We need a total revolution in healthcare system. Copy the system in Israel. Must change
I do hope we get rid of the Obama care it's worthless it took money from taxes from a lot of people
#Trumpcare SUCKS. You will put me in the poor house. Trump, you PROMISED!!!!
If I had a face like yours I’d sue my parents.
U have BIGGEST responsibility for society. U educate people to be blind followers without a clou that 
Do not let your supporters down with healthcare. We the 50 and older need affordable more than anyone.
The poor people in this country without healthcare. Way to go! I'm sure you'd be fine if you got sick.
I know your busy Mr. President but I'm asking you to help these great men and women
@foxandfriends Read the bill. Hate it. With AHCA I'm not winning. I am losing. 26 mil others are losers too
PLEASE...fully REPEAL Obamacare! Ryancare doesn't get the job done. I don't trust Ryan! Gets big $ from ins cos & big pharma! @foxnews @news
Oh yeah #Trump will take your word over Ryan's healthcare since he know you!
#lies #bias #bullshit
Your legacy will be of white nationalism and greed You will never be viewed as mediocre president .
Keep the promise of Healthcare for EVERYONE. Choose: Trump Voters or The Establishment.
I don’t know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.
i think the solution to healthcare is to work with the dems to fixed it, its a win win for both party
24 million people . . . You should all be ashamed of yourselves #notmypresident
No Obamacare reboot please.
listwn to rand paul. Not paul ryan.
Fake listening Lyin' Don Lyin again  don't repeal if you cannot replace. trump's health plan...it's called WEDONTCARE.

I suggest all of you sign up for your new plan!#TrumpIsKillingSeniors
listen to this: I #ReadthePlan ,  it's a nightmare. #youlie
Campaign promise: Insurance coverage for all. Reality: Access for all. Access to and having aren't the same
- "listening sessions"?!? How about staged sound bites? GOP is still afraid to hold real town halls. Sad.
. In a loyal supporter but worried that when you don't put your name on it is it really the best you can do?
Could not have said it better:
https://youtu.be/pWHW-firdts 
heard that older people will have higher cost to new HCARE plan. Wife doubled this year under OCARE .......
It is not government's responsibility to provide everyone with health care.
Why not? Do you have to win birth lottery for $$? Millionaires don't have right to lowest taxes!
Please make every effort to cover all Americans.
Dump Ryan!
Rand Paul's plan or nothing at all. Only two acceptable options.
#LiarInChief
We trust you President Trump!
How many people will you kill with this.  Oh  rich need more money.  I miss Obama so much  cared about us
Did you #read the bill Paul wrote..? Colbert who is running the country this week # 3 Paul Ryan #lssc

I fly coach to save $. Why did I get a private room in hospital? OK with curtain privacy to save $
#FullRepeal, No #ObamacareLite, No #RINOcare @RepGrothman  @RepWesterman @RepArrington  @Rep_Matt_Gaetz
Repeal and replace your presidency. #IMPEACHTRUMP
Trump? Listen? Maybe to the voices in his head...but that's all. #Incompetent
Trumpcare will be amazing!
when signing up show income for health care I think my idea would work it would be better then goingout
#readthebill what's the big secret between Big Gov/Big Pharm & Cannabis legalization? #whycantweberichtoo #transparency
A President who will intentionally harm millions by allowing ACA to fail?  Called Incompetence..Blame HIM
TALK TO Laura Ingraham  PLEASE

How about talking to people who have benefited greatly by the.ACA? You know...the people who's lives were saved.
Your represent, nationalism, hate ,greed ,vulgarity.  Nothing good or decent or for the people.

RIIIIIGHT You got to listen to a few hand picked people! How about Town Halls all over this country?
@speedingisfun @VP @SecPriceMD #Obama only met with Championship Sports teams, never with members of #Congress!
CBO #’s matter.  Negotiate better coverage for less $ for ALL Americans!
did you hear the 24 million people who are about to lose care crying? Or were you too busy counting your 
I ran into the local trump supporters today  #trumptrash

It'sVital thatYouGetTheHealthCareRight&consistentWiithYour campaignPromise;AsTheMovement'sSuccessDependsOn2TermsPresidency!

Holding court like the naked emperor he is. #DonTheCon
be a man not a child stop hating on Obama son
.                        RYAN CARE  is not what we voted for.
You have a wonderful smile!
Of all the mistakes your parents made, you take the cake!
Just let Obamacare explode as this is becoming a black eye for GOP & none of us like the three phase idea!
Listen to Rand Paul. Paul Ryan speaks against Republicans more often than he ever opposes democrats.
we don't want this Trumpdon'tcare plan
THE RICH LOVE THIS NEW HEALTHCARE BILL. THE POOR & THE OLD WILL BE LEFT TO DIE & THE MIDDLE CLASS PAYS MORE
9.9 million surplus Blue Cross Blue Shield CEO gets 10 million $$ bonus total failure
#PaulRyanInMyObit
Repeal the Damn Obama Care then! But Ryan's plan to subsidize insurance companies won't fly.
After hearing this unbelievable statement by Spkr Ryan "Iwill not support Trump now or in future", can we fire him NOW?
Well CBO shows the real truth. You lied to us.
