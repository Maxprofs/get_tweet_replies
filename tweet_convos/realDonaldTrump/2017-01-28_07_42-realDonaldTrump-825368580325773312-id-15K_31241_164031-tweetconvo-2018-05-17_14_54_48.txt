And while we're remembering things, @realDonaldTrump. Thankfully, my family and many others were able to retreat to the United States.

Should be easy to determine if #FakeNews
@mmcgarrett To: @RogueNASA When NASA was NASA and they were our heroes.
@tia6sc Just blocked so many ignorant libtards. Today was a good day.
I was watching this at school when it happened #sadday 
there was an Arab on that Shuttle! Daughter of immigrants!
You mean these astronauts that didn't die? LOL!
@NASA is straight fraud. Where is a picture of the Earth? LOSERS!
yes
Thank You for #Follow
Good Job Mr. President YOU are always in our prayers To Make America Great  Again!
God bless their courage & devotion. What a sad day in history
the irony of you remembering and honoring astronauts all while being anti science. 
May we #NeverForget our American Heroes past present and future
@JusRnE    We will never forgot don't expect haters of America to Remember 911 or any Terrorist attack they r on wrong side
hold fast Mr.President thank you for closing our BORDER'S
-That's what we'll be saying about you in 31 years. Never forget that fucking disaster.
I do remember this. Couldn't believe what news was saying!
teachers on board. Schools had students all watching.
RT @realDonaldTrump "Today, we remember the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger, 31 years later. #NeverForget "
NASA is fake. Please invitigate. Those astronauts are still alive. #fakenasa
@rclark941048  God will destroy those who destroy the Earth. #Bible #God #Happy #Muslims #Christians #DonaldTrump #Jesus
Thank you, Mr. President for honoring this courageous crew. #NeverForget
Forget,,,,,,,, Never, Mr President ! @realDonaldTrump @BolickCarl
how about msl
If we want to honor these people then don't cut America's investments in computational sciences.
Thought they were still alive?
Heroes never die
every person in that picture would have joined @RogueNASA and Christa McAuliffe would be part of the charge against DeVos.
And it only seems like yesterday!!   What a tragic disaster.but, the shuttle continued on great voyages in space.
@ArenFlower7
We shall never forget them !!

, they will never be forgotten.  I clearly remember the morning it happened.
i remember that day very clearly
Hey look at you! Finally found a Challenger you don't have to ridicule or lie about.
#DressLikeAWoman
#alternativefacts they never died innit bruv
I am sure you were golfing and did not give a flying fish when that was going down
we certainly do.
I met Dick Scobee [Capt., center seated] in 1979 as a child & still have his autographed photo; my son's bday is today too!
Heros with origins from Ukraine, Lebanon, Ireland, etc...People who refused to leave segregated library, etc...True America
@POTUS can you even name one of the astronauts??
Wrong date & you're late. The space shuttle Columbia disaster was Feb 1st. 2003. Challenger was Jan 28th.
and I'll think #WTF happened to your shit talking self is our #POTUS. #GodhelpAmerica
You don't even know their names. You are a ridiculous fraud.
@PRESENTPOTUS Never forgotten!
That crew was more divers than your whole cabinet is 
and vale @RichardFeynman
Gee, who told you to Tweet this? Clearly you never think about things like this. You're no John Kennedy. Or even Nixon!
Hey, you have something on your chin...3rd one down.
We support you Donald K . Trump
Gee, I would have thought you'd say "They're not heroes. I like space shuttles that DON'T blow up."
stop trying to kiss up. We will never forget. Don't need u to remind me.
You dishonor their memory! They would all join the #resist movement! #IMPEACHTRUMP!
Challenger program was the culmination of years of the kind of critical, scientific thought that you are undermining. Sad!
there's that pesky science again...hey Drumpf, have you shut down NASA yet on letting the public know scientific data?
Who told you to REMEMBER? You sure did not remember any of this by yourself. Never forget? Never forget your Orange Ass.
I may love to shop but I'm not buying your bullshit.
You suck. Nobody cares what you say or think. #Impeach
they think you're a hack fuckboi don

Time for  Star Wars. Reagan's dream.
thank you Barack Obama
@Freechoice16 
RIP.
pretty ballsy to put up a tribute to the Challenger crew while you're cutting funding to @nasa. Oh wait not ballsy, STUPID!
@cb55uic watched it live on TV as it happened...
#NeverForget is just for 9/11, idiot
@POTUS @NASA @NASA360 @NASA_Astronauts @NASAEarth 

@daftpunkstore @nilerodgers @Pharrell
I wonder if you remembered the liberation of Auschwitz on the day you were signing executive orders to ban Muslims. #regret
maybe if those 6 million Jews could have fit nicely into a pic, you would have mentioned them on holocaust Remembrance Day
Yesterday, we humans remembered the Holocaust-my father served in WWII. You have never served this country nor are you now.
as scientists they are doubtless horrified by how you- I mean Steve Bannon - are running the country. #StopPresidentBannon
If these great scientists were alive today, would you censor them too? @TheAltEPA @AltNatParkSer
You Might Want To Watch This #Challenger #Documentary @BunkyTheMonkey ....http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/hmUF9 …
You're such a fake!  Yet, you didn't even mention the Jews in remembrance of the Holocaust.  Horrible person u are
THEY WOULDNT WANT YOUR REMEMBRANCE.
I will #Neverforget #GodblessNASA for all the Work that they do
Dave :-)
That was so sad.  It makes me love our country that much more knowing we are brave and strong.
I wish my country Nigerian will be captured again and make it great.
#NeverForget the muslims in america smh
Never forget? We will never forget the damage you are doing to our nation.
pretty certain they'd be APPALLED by your actions for & under Steve Bannon.
#MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall #littlemantrump
rather a shame that you forgot the Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day :(
This crew was brave, believed in science, & united and inspired the whole world. So, the exact opposite of you.
You #Phubbing numpty! The Space Shuttle Challenger is NOT what #NeverForget refers to. Pease #GFY #NeverTrump #DeathToTrump
Can you name them?
The Challenger exploding shortly after launch is going to become a painful symbol for you.
I'm surprised you remembered anything but your own ego.
ok
Shiny Object! Ignore my disastrous Immigration Order, Russian Inquiry and Conflicts of Interest! #shortfingeredvulgarian
god bless them Rest In Peace
if you would've been president then, you probably wouldn't have let them try or ban nasa from sharing the tragedy w/ media
You remember nothing! #impeachnow #StopPresidentBannon
, I will bet EVERYONE in that photo would have NOT VOTED FOR YOU!
there is no real Donald trump.   Yes I remember the challenger.    Tough time explaining to school kids.    Hard for for
Hard for me to understand
@MonikiIIa same one?
yesssss lol didn't want to retweet cause of the source
were you remembering the victims of the Holocaust on their Remembrance Day when you issued that ridiculous muslim ban?
can you call them by their names?  Without any help from one of your poor aides  #neverforget #blablabla
ik heb een beetje het vermoeden dat hij je mentions nooit leest  @realDonaldTrump
hmmm denk je? en die andere honderdduizenden gezellige reacties ook niet zeker #teleurgesteld in @realDonaldTrump
@JenseAaron your presidency is a bigger disaster than the Challenger. #impeach
you're right. he does know nothing.
Today, we remember the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger, 31 years later. #NeverForget ...
it's a good man
Idiots
Не Боги горшки обжигали (русская пословица)
Отличный кадр.
I remember this like it happened yesterday.
Too bad your cutting funding to NASA... if only there was someone who cared about the future of the human race...
I remember that day well.  I was in 9th grade science class watching when the shuttle exploded.  I still have all their photos from NASA.
.@realDonaldTrump 31 YEARS! Where's the time go
We should honer their spirits, by continuing the exploration they had believed they were working toward, back then.
is this right to ban countries... It seems weak america not great america..
#NeverForget #canNotforget one of my sons was born a minute after the explosions We stopped looking in horror & got back WK
mind control is like stupidity, if your stupid, your probably to stupid to ever figure it out. Just look @ Hollywood/media
I'd be surprised if you can name even one of them

Science research leads to an increase in the economy, just saying
Today, we remember the crew of the Death Star. #NeverForget
#NeverForget
I was stationed in Korea serving my country when this happened. What were you doing? Sacrificing by building big buildings?
Let's remember them by slashing the budget for NASA! Fucking magnets, how do they work?
I remember that as a child.  Let's bring back the space shuttle and get America back into space again.
Yeah they sold out to psychos like you amd look what happened to em
sorry Mr.prez but this is one thing I don't see eye to eye with you. NASA has lied to us for to long. This ain't you!
whose the Dick in the middle? Everyone else got both names. Lol.
We were stationed in Germany when this happened. I was watching the lift off and then screams everywhere. So sad.

*Hillary supporters* Protest and fight amongst themselves and say screw the crew all because they don't like he was elected
*Donald Trump supporters* Sit together to remember the shuttle.
we will never forget. This was a tragedy for our nation.
they all still alive dough
31 years from now, nobody will remember YOU!
Thank God someone reminded you.
@This420_guy These were real people of intelligence. They deserve our honor. You do not.
That's exactly right.
Your　remarks have brought tension in the good sense to the world.

they apparently knew something we didn't #dyinginafireisbetterthanatrumppresidency
aww... you are pretending to have a heart. No one is buying it!!!
