Mexico calling #DopeyDonald with a down payment for his #FuckingWall: #NoBanNoWall #NotMyPresident #SoCalledPresident #ImpeachTrump
#DopeyDonald is a cowardly lying sack of shit: https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/857707466896928770 … #NotMyPresident #SoCalledPresident #UnPresidented #ImpeachTrump
"An America that was free, was respected around the world […]": @realDonaldTrump's main task is to destroy that. http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2621500 
you gave us Canadians a good laugh Check out @JPTasker's Tweet:
"Yes he was very much thinking about cancelling," PMJT says of his call with @realDonaldTrump last night after he threatened to rip up NAFTA 
The world is laughing at us.
I think we're over laughing. Now we're just angry at Trump & cheering on Americans resisting him
True negotiator??  He caved like he always does!!!
He caved like an unregulated coal mine.
guys if you made over min. Wage you would respect what the Don is doing
Or if you ever picked up a book instead of watching The Apprentice
GOD BLESS you #PresidentTrump your doing great thank you   #MAGA
The Art of the Deal...be willing to walk away if the terms don't suit you.
He did not write The Art if the Deal. You do know that right?
You're confusing that book with Dreams From My Father, which Obama didn't write.
So I guess you don't know. Tony Schwartz wrote every word.  Trump has never even read a book, much less written one.
Trump read and knows what is in the book! Stop your lying and trying to put Trump down!
Too bad you do not have talent except for gossip!
It's not gossip it's public knowledge. Trump himself has said he does not read books.
Not all books, but he does read a lot!
No he doesn't.  Even reports must be provided in graphics or bullet points to him. He's unable to focus.

do you know how the Wizard solves the scarecrow's problems at the end of the movie?  By giving him a fake degree. *Trump University*


actually..this is yet another lie. You called them to initiate this. You are a serial liar & will do or say anything for attention..#uspoli
I know.  His followers believe him hook line and sinker.  I have no idea why.
Or they listen to Fox News-less news
I saved the definition of "cognitive dissonance" for you.

#deplorables, take note

#impeachtrump
#hypocrite
#MAGAmyass
#theresistance
Trump lied to his followers. It will take some time for them to come to terms with his betrayal.
Nixon had 24% approval on the day he resigned in disgrace.  

racism, ignorance and fear "trump" all else, apparently
Wow have you been right: Méjico loves you.
Mexico calling #DopeyDonald with a down payment for his #FuckingWall: #NoBanNoWall #NotMyPresident #SoCalledPresident #ImpeachTrump 
You mean you got another history/economics/ current affairs lesson from the foreign leaders?!?
How kind of you.
Did Canada agree to pay for the Mexico border wall?

#MSM twists everything the "president" says! #Spicer: it'll be huge, with 2 Taco Bells & 3 Chipotles! #SAD #FakeSolutions #TheResistance 
Proud of the job you are doing President Trump, thank you sir. 
What exactly are you proud of? He's basically saying he campaigned on ignorance then changed his mind once he learned some facts.
Actually rumor has it you called them BEGGING to renegotiate so you dont have to keep your promise. You lied, and lied, and just keep lying
Trudeau was going to kick his ass. Again.
Trudeau is disliked by Canadians as much as Obama was/is by Americans.
That would be the same demographic. 
Less educated, racially biased whites. 
Haters gonna hate.
Masters degree not uneducated white folk!
I think you need to review the demographics a bit closer.
BECAUSE YOU PICKED UP THE PHONE not like OBUMA WHO WENT OUT FOR ICE CREAM EVERY DAY & PLAYED GOLF CONSTANTLY DID obuma KNOW HE WAS POTUS?!!
@pink_lady56 @JudgeJeanine @MOVEFORWARDHUGE @Debbietazz @Josbowm @NewportLost @POTUS TRUMP IS A BORN LEADER! OBUMA NOT AT ALL!!
Yes indeed!!
@Stella_Basham 
I miss @stephenharper more everyday. Canada took great leadership for granted. Save us fr #PMSpudly
I'm happy the 10 minute "speed dating for diplomacy" is working out so well for you. Who knew diplomacy was so easy?
You really are pathetic...
Canadian prime minister office confirmed he never called you #fakenews
.@RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet.
So you once again lied to your base, "I am going to rip up NAFT, the worst deal in history".. and nope, another lie and failed promise
if the deal is not right, then shitcan it
U do realize tariffs r tax on US ppl? If Canadian taxpayers subsidize wood going 2 US, it's cheaper 4 ur home builders & buyers to buy homes
yes but we need to buy American if possible.
leaders around the world are shaking in their boots cause they NEVER expected to deal with Donald Trump They were just gonna pay Hitlery off

#MSM twists everything the "president" says! #Spicer: it'll be huge, with 2 Taco Bells & 3 Chipotles! #SAD #FakeSolutions #TheResistance 
I believe the leaders of Mexico and Canada realize you're really no good at the "Art of the Deal," so of course they want to "renegotiate."
Can you ever tell the truth omg #fakepresident
Please stop imagining that both domestic and  international politics are a version of the NY real estate market.
Let me guess .. NAFTA is a bit more complicated than you thought?
Funny ... they have an entirely different take on these calls. How shocking ... 
.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump just got finessed by Mexico & Canada 
I'd like to hear their version of the phone calls. You're not trustworthy.
They called you and you caved. You have not made one deal. You haven't instructed your treasury secretary to do anyting. China owns you.
You're my President for the next 8 yrs.
Thanks Obama
@DonaldJTrumpJr Thank you!!! Mexico & Canada have been screwing us for years!
Trump has been captured by the globalists.  He now says the wall is 'to stop people traffickers', not illegals:  that's globalist talk.

Nobody can be 'a nationalist and a globalist'.  And Trump said the globalists were the enemy - which they are.
He clearly has been taught otherwise since getting into the White House or was acting the entire time lol
Ensure American people are first in all dealings!!!!!!
Mexico wants to renegotiate NAFTA! Well well fork over some money to pay for that wall!
No you didn't.
Of course, that was after some staffer explained to you what NAFTA is.
Let's see the transcript! Transparency?!
#AMERICAFIRST
ah, so you had a staffer read "NAFTA FOR DUMMIES" to you? Tremendous plan.
More bull crap! Can you spell the word truth? Here I'll help. T R U T H. That's it. Five little letters. Not too tuff.
We still support you PDJT, looks like the same crying s who live on every one of ur tweets cannot get over the fact u won!  Even though..
they r still the fools chasing the wind does not mean we do not get it!  We win when u win & We lose when u lose so our prayers are with u!
Yep, you'll soon see that UNDER VALUING our trading neighbors is a BIG mistake. #NotQualified. Please RESIGN. Oh yeah #TrumpRussia!
Salt
among other things.
You are truly the "artist of the deal"!
Continue making us proud sir!
If I can do anything to assist, do not hesitate to call on me!
Dont give up on the health care bill. Anything is better than obama care. Spike the price of abortions to a ridiculous amount.
They hate you as much as we do. #100DaysOfFailure
They probably called you to explain how only Congress can repeal NAFTA, seeing as how it's a treaty... that congress approved.
Incorrect. It's a CEA
True, a CEA, which does not negate my original point that Trump cannot withdraw from NAFTA without Congressional action as well.
Trade act of 1974, extension in 2015 delegated the President authority to withdraw, modify trade agreements, designate currency manipulators
we didn't here anything new about the Mexico wall, or you above turn
Clown
Good for you
Bravo!!! What the Dimms miss is the fact that a strong position creates a negotiation position instead of surrender.
.... another DREAM?

I think they ignore you #TrumpRussiaCollusion
I just saw the Mexican president say being president is hard, that you should go back to your old life. 67% ppl agree! #ImpeachmentParty
You called them you LIAR #GrabYourWallet
Are you serious....
我相信你可以让别人屈服 但是最终不会是你想要的结果.
"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country,"  Who said that?   YOU DID?  YOU FOOL
They knocked some sense into your empty head
good job!
@DonaldJTrumpJr They are going to be astounded at a President for the people of the USA.
@DonaldJTrumpJr They are definitely going to be astounded by a President for the people of the USA.
Narcissist tip-off #32: starting every sentence with "I".
Another campaign promise that our going to break. You can do shit
Good job , but sometimes when deals are renegotiated they come out worse for us !!!
Lol.  As if.  You know you couldn't cancel #nafta no one believes you #bigly #100daysofshame
Idk. Im 50 50 on if it should be negotiated. You know what you are doing and i trust you will make the right decision. Keep up the good work
 U LYING TRAITOROUS ANTIAMERICAN PIECE OF . RELEASE URE TAXES U @PutinRF_Eng PUPPET! UVE DONE ZERO IN  DAYS LIAR 
ENOUGH SAID 
You're doing a great job President Trump!
@EPN @JustinTrudeau señores presidentes manden a volar a este cretino de trump!Negocien entre ustedes dosSolo Canadá y mexico juntos
Haitians expect you to be their champion by renewing the TPS. Add $50 to their fees which I shall collect for the Diaspora Trust Fund.
Could you hear they were holding their noses as they talked to you?

#npr #cnn #HuffPostPol #nyt #WaPo #AP_Politics #foxnews #BBCnews #msnbc
Canada HATES you!!!! You are a huge joke here!!!! The Orange hitler!!! 
留个言看看，证明我来过，证明我关注过。特朗普看你的了，看你会回复我吗？
#Livestream the meeting. :)
Liberals sitting behind keyboards lecturing with typical superiority spite while trolling. It's typical, irrelevant & typical of cowards.
Of course you did..it's right for all Countries and their ppl.  Don't forget there r Canadians that support ur cause..we r friend and family
If you cannot do good at least do no harm.  Study the NAFTA  documents  and understand before you kill jobs.  Or ask senator McCain for help
BULL SHIT lies .....
just like the armada you sent to S. Korea. Got it.
Illegitimate president if you weren't so pathetic you be almost funny. You haven't fulfilled one of your pre-election promises not one sick!
How about build wall then let Mexico make a call concerning trade
Did they ask you about #Trumprussia #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #trumpRussiaCollusion?  Or about #wiretapgate?  Or China currency? Or @NATO
You're selling out all the people who voted for you. No different from @BarackObama. #ShouldhavevotedforHilary #sellout #DraintheDeppState
Every now and then I get a huge heebie jeebie when I realize Donald Trump is in the white house .
Lying don stop trying to con America.  You have ZERO CREDIBILITY U can't even get a bill passed with a Republican majority All the EO's.

Do you have any idea of what U R doing? I have not seen anyone flip flop as much as since... well no one! Your inconsistency is mindblowing!
In other words you banged into Realpolitik & did another U-turn
You're not too good at this are you, Sonny?
Mike Flynn.
Because you change your mind like you change your underwear (I hope).
Just another round of BS. Hey Putin, since you're in charge, what actually happened?
Definitivamente nuestros representantes son títeres de una minoría.
Flip flopper
@LisaBornfree247 you have a good relationship with the president of Mexico? Are you insane? I think they all hate your guts like we all do!
@BillPar24756930 Trudope will take all your Mooslums
Great So what about the Kurds? Right thing to do I know it's a lot but Turkey, they need to go
Not even a flip flop. A complete cave, and all it took was a phone call. Most impotent, hapless president ever.
Did they really call YOU, or did you call them? You know we can find that out right? #maga #alternativefacts #TheResistance
Bravo!
Good thing for you. Those 2 countries are our best trade partners. 1/3 of total exports r to them. You have to control your temper tantrums
Now get every thing you want you got them over a barrel because they are evil!
Weak.. sad
@WayneJ28791698 did #EffffingVicente call?
Why?
It isn't a New York Real Estate hustle... hope you can handle diplomacy.
You keep making it harder to defend you. If the Democrats hadn't cheated, Bernie would be there to end NAFTA. You owe Assange/Wikkileaks
Pompous nether. region
Well someone finally explained the NAFTA to you 
Twitter bots are algorithms that construct human like phrases based on Trump's key words. Note the rapid automatic responses;  hate driven.
When did you get your brain transplant?
to report a crime of an Alien harming you from an flying saucer

the DHS crime reporting line is 1866 347 2423
P.S. You're the neighbor everybody hates.  
Get your ass to work loser
Because you's a biiiiiitch. Can't negotiate if it would save your life. Can't even run a. Business or university without going bankrupt
Funny how they will negotiate once you hold their feet to the fire.  OUTSTANDING JOB Mr
 President!
Im one of the small majority that can care less if you release your tax returns. You are doing a fantastic job.
Liar !  You called them to give you the appearance of a so called win
Another broken promise. Keep up the charade.
Trump playing CHESS again, while the idiot left keep trying to play him in checkers.  Trump wins again!
DT made a stupid threat. Other leaders educated him on the benefits of NAFTA to U.S.. More like Trump embarrasses the U.S. again.
You are

Surprised PM Trudeau found time between taking selfies and running his fingers through his own hair to phone. #whatajoke #selfie #trudeau
Surprised someone who claims to "love Jesus Christ" spreads such rude, hateful comments.
Nothing rude and hateful about what I said.  It's the truth.
Have mercy on Canada  electing Trudeau was a colossal mistake, he does not represent sane Canadian's :-)
So you think most Canadians are not sane? He has a high approval rating. Most feel country is doing better.
I think many Cdn's don't pay attention to Trudeau's actions. If Cdn's have bought into the ridiculous political correct crap we are screwed
Lots of great initiatives. GNP up. Employment up. More $ for seniors. Lower taxes for mid-class. Maybe you pay too much attention to CPC.
You need to stop buying into his lies & actually look at the tax changes and real job stats. Low paying part time jobs rather than full time

I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than t...
America is dying because Americans have not invested in themselves for years.  We must acknowledge the Global Perspective.
#FakeNews was right again
Trump KNEW Mexico wasn't paying for the wall& only cared about the press not finding out!

A race of erasure, he means to reface sky, to renegotiate the dirt, to undermine the offered.

Demand that they get a hand on their corruption so their citizens will stop breaking out laws to come here.
America has enough third world.
Lic. Lorenzo Córdova, por que permite que el PRI o cualquier partido, pasen promocioales de partido, en plena campaña a gobernadores.
Thanks for you service.  We love you.
Expertise is good for business.
Trade "figured" makes it free. Once it was a slave route; under NAFTA renegotiation it can be a freedom route. All emancipate with truth.***
I have reasons for voting Trump over Hillary to points, but this is the one that hit home: Its loss was imminent under her; it has a chance.
Power to u.
They had to pull out a map and educate you before you understood,
terminate it

Liar. Did the fucking Easter Bunny call you, too?
Thanks:-)
Or getting sued for fraud lol
But you didn't deliver, which is why Rexnord moved those jobs to Mexico. Do what you said you were going to do quut the blame game
Liar
Good NAFTA JUST NAMJ just tell them what you'll accept as fair deal, don't accept so be it, they called you remember wall goes in terms
Liar
You should wear boots not  flip flop's.
you just very weird Donald, just a very weird and disturbing person and self-centered but I guess you won the presidency
Mr President this is awful the way these people attack you. Why don't they give you a  chance? It is so disrespectful
pfff
After you trashed and tarriffed. Terrible!
