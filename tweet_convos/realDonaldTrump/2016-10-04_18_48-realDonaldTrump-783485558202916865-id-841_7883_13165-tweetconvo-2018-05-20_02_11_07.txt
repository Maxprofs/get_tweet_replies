@DebAlwaystrump @timkaine I comprehend he pretends he  doesn't comprehend.
twitter would not allow me to retweet this.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine 
Who is Kaine getting hand signals from in the audience? He keeps looking out there and nods his head!
LIKE HI LIAR SCRATCHING HER CHEEK 6x DURING DEBATE. DID HC HAVE THE EAR PIECE IN FOR ANSWERS?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine

@Madaza41 @realDenaldTrump the first time I ever saw this tweet was the other day when someone posted it.  Never before that!
@Scooter41471 @Madaza41 @realDenaldTrump Seriously? You still don't get it.

Hillary deeply unfit and unwell, you've seen the spaz-outs & seizures, now look the cross eyes #VPDebate
Yup. Yup. And yup. #Hillary's Sick

#VPDebate @GOP @realDonaldTrump @timkaine


@erindschmitt66 @GOP @timkaine-Hillary two pairs of shoes which is unfit for American people.

Hillary called an ex KKK member, Robert Byrd, her friend and mentor, Byrd is a fucking monster
You should read his life story instead of parroting some meme
I don't want to read the life story of a life long racist who filibustered the 1964 civil rights act
Life long? 

Thank u for confirming your ignorance. 

Bye
he recruited KKK members then filibustered one of the most important pieces of legislation for civil rights, you're an idiot

@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Kaine would have done better if he stayed at home!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine This guy is a little fn creep thats what.
.@GOP: In @timkaine's own words  #Debates2016
AH YEP AND THAT IS WHAT THE DEPORABLES HAVE BEEN SCREAMING, BUT THE CROOKEDS keep lying.

I can tell you secretly love me. 

It's OK, you'll get over me in time
They don't have any strategy, just  "Chauvinists and Sexists and Misogynists" https://youtu.be/26-VzfBZg1w 
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine The problem is we need to STOP SUPPORTING ISIS.
Just goes to show you Kaine doesn't believe in the almighty Obama. Doesn't believe the propaganda that's coming from Dems
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine well we are in trouble because Trump says he knows more about ISIS than the Generals, "believe me!" I DON'T!
@DavidDoright @timkaine 

I don't think Kaine provides the power of decision making to be potus if he was called to that position.
They have no policy.  That is the problem
He defined the problem. DJT will begin solving the prob, once in Office ! 
Nothing offered for change.
the problem is you and your running mate period
Kaine is a loser.. and he seems to  push the Race Card on Trump a Typical liberal move to try and get votes.
@ClassySnobbb @timkaine
they never have had one...oh wait, Obama has one.....destroy America...
@RWSalt @timkaine Gotcha! 
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine  lol they told the truth for once! 
Not all you have not got. You have got no clue!
American's have a plan, and it don't include Socialist commies!
don't have a clue
do have a clue
arguing on the internet with a liberal is a waste of time. Goebel would be proud of Killery. Trump people are patient
@ChastityTamu Bad influence Democrats
I have the best strategy. I'll tell you later what it is.
No offense, stating: Kaine should be sweeping streets.

Did Kaine just say terrorist threat is decreasing??? #VPDebate #KaineMeltdown 
neither does the president that's why there still going strong.With trump and Pence we will get rid of them.
No the problem is you don't have a comprehensive thought in you head! Does your head whistle when you're out in the wind?
You can tell by last nights argument that he has never been paid for his work ethics just his mouth  I say USED CAR  SALESMAN
Tim Kaine is nasty, he interrupted 79 times.  Indeed the #Obama #Clinton strategy is more taxes and more #corruption.
Duh George?! @GOP @timkaine
UHM????
He wasn't her running mate back then idiot. He and HRC do have a plan, what is yours?
wow must be before Hillary took his mind and personality now he is just a puppet for Hillary she ruins everything & people to
@realDonaldTrump kaine must have slip up. truth is no plan in 4 years from now if Hillary gets in & terrorist be much worse
Aside from arming ISIS in a secret arms deal.
He finally told the truth in the interview.
Of course they don't. They're pro radical Islam. Believe what they DO & research their affiliations, policies & memberships.
I'm going with the Donald !!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amen, Bro
HAHA HAHAHA
B Hussein NEVER had a "Strategy"! He just followed orders.
That is what you think. BHO wants to destroy USA,. @HillaryClinton and HUMA are his write hand, But HC will not win. DT will.
i would say for anything ....
kaine about asBad and stupid as Hil Liar y. Losers wither they win or not. Hil Liar y won't ever be my president like Carter and obama.
@sweetp1957 @timkaine He looks desperate that is why he attacksTrump in every sentencce
They are helping the terrorists.. don't need it
That seems to have been accurate.  Hmm.
We can fight ISIS and defeat them with Cyber Warfare.
facts are very inconvenient for the Dems.
Tim and Hillary are typical politicians. Will say ANYTHING 2 get votes. Then abandon the people for 4 years #Followthemoney
KNEW THAT ALREADY!!
First off let in US syrian refugees and potential  ISIS members. 2nd have open borders. Part of comprehensive plan.

Twitch is a bit disconnected.
they dont have comprehensive anything except for how HRC/BC can add to their wealth using WH to do it She's Corrupt to core
Open bordersI don't want my grandchildren to grow up in the middle east right in the heart of America.
wow...and they want to be in office...with no strategy?  They actually think...Americans...are really stupid!!!
Mike Pence awesome job last night now Donald Trump do the same thing Sunday night DO not let her draw you in
I think Russia had right idea. Bomb the Hell out of them. Their reason is wrong though
Trump does. he's just not stupid enough 2 make it public.Liberals do & tip off ISIS thereby endangering USA Military
and the truth comes out
I HATE THE THOUGHT OF LIL'TIMMY NEING PREZ WHEK KILLARY'S ILLNESS TAKES HER. THE GOP IS AS DEADLY AS CANCER 2 U.S.
BOTH SIDES OF OUR BI-LATERAL SYSTEM ARE WHINER CRY BABIES.  AMERICA IS AWAKE AND SICK OF BOTH PARTIES. WE WON'T TAKE ANYMORE!
The problem is ISIS was created after we invaded Iraq of which 97% of republicans voted for.
@ABC ...@CBSTweet @AbcarianLAT @DatelineNBC @CNNOpinion @MSNBC @FoxNews ...Hillary the one who would destroy this country.
Where's the GOP's strategy?
who nobody like him that why mike pence didnt protect him
Clowns Kaine and Hillary are not working for the American people period. All lies and incompetence it's scary obvious.
not surprised. They are toxic and do not deserve to be on the same stage as TRUMP
this guys a joke he reminded me of when those monkeys clapping. In the circus
Obama/HRC foreign policy strategy is to have no strategy! By looks of things in Mid East, its working. Failure is his success
like when asked last night''what would he do if missiles were launched by Korea''answer was 'we need more intel 1st.
this is A REAL MAN WITH A PLAN:
His biggest jaw dropper was saying the more taxes you pay the better off you are. My mind reels at his logic it is so inane!
Kane is a loudmouth woose
the only true thing he said
..@timkaine #creepyclown
Can you name Israeli military in favor of Iran deal?
No shit


No. The problem is they have one but it's the wrong one.
this kaine clown is scary
that was a year ago
they're incompetent w/out a clue, it amazes me that people are following them especially w/her history
TIM KAINE WAS ON FULL FRONTAL ATTACK MODE.HE TRIED TO GO TOPRIOR ARGUMENTS.DIDN'T WORK,PENCE TOO SMART COULDN'T BE BATE.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Tim, you are rude and unprofessional. All you did during the debate is interupt Mike. Mike let you speak.
his problem is his attitude and lack of facts
Exactly! Nothing but declaring war on ISIS ON A WORLD WIDE SCALE IS GOING TO DESTROY THIS IDEOLOGY !
OOPS.  We the people who have actually served our nation in combat have known that for at least 8 years now.
and you & Hillary are going to change that? How stupid do you think we are! Hillary has used a failing plan all her time!

< Somewhere in Virginia a village is looking for their idiot who has gone missing.
that shouldn't be a problem lol
I'd say @timkaine was as obnoxious & classless as you can get, he's nothing more than @HillaryClinton's lapdog. #VPDebate
poor excuse you should have a strategy to protect the American.
Yep.. U 2 losers think everything is great cause YOU have money and good insurance.  U guys SUCK
-- don't forget Hillary's own words!!!
KAINE IS A DOOFUS,
" And because we haven't debated it, the administration hasn't had to come up with a sound strategy"
ACTUAL QUOTE: "Bottom line, we're involved in a war that Congress hasn't debated,"
"Out of the mouths of BABES".
Great
he looks like a jack in the box clown
Trump doesn't have any policy other than the same old gop trickle down economics class warfare, & war. derp
Obama/Clinton = Failed Foreign Policy an Failed Domestic Policy...
Kaine is Loco
wow! does that administration ever have one? #EpicFailKaine you don't want to be associated w/such evil as @HillaryClinton
The problem is that they are myopic utopians  relying on insults and ignorance
@RealBenCarson Lying comes easy to these animals. Some sincerity in debate; then I read morning joe quote you forwarded. No integrity
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine No hello to girl? Girl got scared. Hillary goons push girl away so HRC could get a https://photo-oppic.twitter.com/pamul1LONS 
.Dare I suggest even meandering, cave dwellers know Obama's strategy is NO STRATEGY! Dems rich in platitudes!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine And she's not fond of Jews. She's like Hitler!

@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Hillary chose Kaine. But she's still a Racist. It's all about the votes! 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tMegFe2GUp4 …
@corrcomm @timkaine why would they want 2 end something @HillaryClinton & Obama so carefully created.Chaos=part of their communist plot
The problem is YOU and HILLARY.  HILLARYOUS!  Now let's be serious...Trump and Pence get my vote.
The all rule - all the rules apply to all the people all the time for the good of all!
They want an agenda, not policy, theres no commitment to USA when communism & slavery is the agenda.

Killary&Kaine don't have a plan-well surprise! Only 2 lie & attack-she can't run on record it's soooo bad!!!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine How could anyone want this guy one step away from being president!?! Wow! What a loon!
after 8 damn years these brilliant ppl don't have a plan.
AND WE STILL DON'T WITH THE MORONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. JEEZ, HOW DID MIKE FLYNN STAY AS LONG AS HE DID?
No we have no strategy- but it has been the democrat's in charge for the last 8 years- so that's on them.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine noticed that was almost a year ago. Think maybe a new plan exists?
To which I'd say, "I'm sure as hell YOU won't come up with one either."
THEY ONLY HAVE INSULTS AMERICANS DESERVE A CHANGE AND THE CHANGE IS  TRUMP
By the way is Jesuits apart of the freemasons talk about racist and Hitlary idol is Margaret Sanger who genocides minorities
@DanScavino @timkaine Yeah,U do! Kick can another 30 years!No jobs,no benefits,they will self-deport!Bld Walls!No Sanctuary City's!
typical rude Democrats.
Hillary/Kaine are employing the "Whistling Dixie" Defense!
there you go!
The things you say when you tell the truth and never think you will run with a Clinton..#TruthFail
@rob_mcwaters @timkaine The problem is u won't shut up!!!
