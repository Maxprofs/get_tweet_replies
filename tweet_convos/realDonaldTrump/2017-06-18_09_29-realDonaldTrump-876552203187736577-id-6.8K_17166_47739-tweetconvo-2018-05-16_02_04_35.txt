Trump is amazing in so many ways. #MAGA #CCOT
Any update?
We are fighting them in Syria and Afghanistan
So, is ISIS defeated?
Pres Trump never said he'd defeat ISIS in 30 days,he called 4 The Pentagon 2 develop a plan in 30 days 2 defeat them

So he repealed his own Executive Order giving The Pentagon 30 days to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS?
The fact your Twitter identity is tied to a propaganda catchphrase tells me all I need to know. That Kool-Aid must be tasty.
So very sad. This young man has died today. His blood is on Obama's hands
Do you really believe everything you read from the trump family puts out??
Why was it so easy for the Trump administration to get that kid released? It appears Obama didn't want to make waves as usual. Wake up!
When are you all going to wake up and realise trump didn't do anything??? He didn't get NK to do anything.NK laughs at trump.
The entire world laughs at Trump!
And at his deplorables
Yes!!!
We're laughing because we're winning, Republican took all special elections, looks like we're still winning. And this story about Otto sad
Obama's administration is parlty to blame for his death. So very .
how do you figure that? asking seriously
Father Of Otto Warmbier: Obama Admin Told Us To Keep Quiet, Trump Admin Brought Him Home. Why would they do that??
Misleading headline. Trump did nothing, and Obama did work on it. China isn't helping us with NK. It's a mess.
Get real! Trump got him home. Also successfully negotiated the release of the American Egyptian prisoner
Liar. No, he didn't. My god, do you guys actually know FACTS?
Fact is they both came home under Trump after spending years in captivity under Obama. Period
Obama admin told them to keep quiet...what were they going to do if they didn't keep quiet????  That's the question...  thank you @POTUS

You're going to find out exactly what kind of father you have by whether he goes to jail to keep y'all out of trouble...
And what have U had to say about the 7 lost sailors today - since U want something to brag about for an ego boast? Shame U could not see
So that means you hates him for being black? Well tell you what SISTER, he did he'll of a job as president considering that he's black
This should b eye opener even to those in darkness.The Light shines & yet the darkness cannot comprehend.Righteousness is seen by her fruit!
Has your dad mentioned the Sailors who lost their life yet?  Or is he still tweeting poll numbers?
Actually just tweeting polls. No mention that they were found dead. He is a despicable man....not worthy of being #potus
Seriously?!  Obama played golf while ppl were dying...
As I said in the past, whatever Barry does or did or says or said u do the opposite, bc he is a far leftist
Obama would not have told to me to be quiet if it was my Son, he would have heard me loud and clear, Obama is full of the devil 
Obummer is Satan's tool!!
Ufff que fina, cuanta clase tienes... Calladita te ves mas bonita hon !
Fina, como tu presidente?
Y tu cafre como tu casi Presidenta ??
What crimes, praytell?
Bust there ass. They are cancer to our way of life. I'll serve!
Donald Jr., You are proving to so many Americans that the "apple does not fall far from the apple tree" but lays rotten!
Not their kids! There's video when  they were toddlers, both families,  billion $!home in Hawaii,Everything the. O  uh's did was a farce.
Obama wasn't even mentioned at ALL in that article.
Shouldn't you be clubbing kittens or something?
Not surprising you have yet to mention the 7 US Navy sailors killed
Yet Trump admin. preparing to send dozens of Assyrian Christians back to a genocide zone - Christians he promised to protect in his campaign
Sweden facilitated the release & NK obliged because it would be an act of war if he died in their custody. Don't forget the facts here...
Suddenly everyone knows this "fact" only when Trump comes to power.
That doesn't make it less of a fact!
Maybe a fact but it's been a fact all during his captivity. NK knew Obamas lines meant nothing .
They wanted him off of the grounds before he died. Did you know negotiations were ongoing? No, so how do you know what Obama was doing?
Ask Ottos father
Naw... He probably didn't know all of the moves that Sweden was making trying to get his son back either.
Did u hear his father, or are u assuming like the liberals
You're still a loser, 45. I heard how you behaved at the Teacher of the Year WH visit, still banging on about your Electoral College votes.
YOU DRUNK AGAIN? OH YA I FORGOT YOU ARE DRUNK 24/7 HEY DIAPER DONNIE?
Maybe you should cool it on the self congratulations.
He has brain damage.
It's not about you or your father.
Time to grow up.
By the way, if Trump is so good at this, why are there still 3 hostages there from the US.  Why weren't they released at the same time?
I am horrified that you would use this tragedy in this way.
I'm horrified that you won t acknowledge  the failing of Obama in this case  & choose to criticize Don Jr.

Why did it take so long??
So sorry he was taken from you .
Interesting. Now NK is going to be a close partner and Kim was excellent to the three hostages. Guess no justice for Otto Warmbier after all. Just another sleazy photo op for daddy.
@realDonaldTrump @rcpvideo  Fake news...bullshit!
#realclearpolitics.com is worst than the #nationalenquirer another media hound.

@ElfindaleLane @rcpvideo Don. We could use your dads help 2get Canadian Pastor Lim out of there. @JustinTrudeau had no luck
C'mon give it a rest. Every alpha male jokes this way. Get over it honey you women were made to love. What's wrong with that??
No...Not men this age. Maybe men , immature men in their 20's or early 30's... trump was already in his late 50's when he made these remarks
And lets bot forget the comment about dating Ivanka if she werent his Daughter... Would you say that about your daughter? I hope not!
I couldn't find your father's Father's Day tweet...
This is how Presidents president. #RelationshipGoals
A Father's Day Tweet, How Sweet! Lol.Altho, most families show their love & appreciation without attention or approval from Twit Experts! Js
I am so sorry, your father turned his back on you???
Can understand why
Lmao. Did you just try to burn me & then laughed at yourself?!  Try to not like your own pics too, it's kind of like licking your own A$s 
RT @DonaldJTrumpJr: Not surprising at all! Father Of Otto Warmbier: Obama Admin Told Us To Keep Quiet, Trump Admin Broug...
True past weakness defined....
Haven't heard a peep from @POTUS after a lot of tough talk. Is this how we let others treat Americans? #alltalknoaction
Ur dad brought him back brain dead....great job
you and your father still haven’t acknowledged the sailors who died in the naval ship tragedy.
How the hell did these ships with all the radar equipment run into each other?
Status report?
Shhhhhh.thats secret too.
ISIS is being annihilated. Raqqa will fall very soon.
So, not in 30 days. Got it.
Won't be 7 years I can assure you
Why they hell would your assurance make any difference? Pump the brakes on the condescension.
He had no business going to North Korea. And why would you try to steal while you're there? Asking for trouble feel bad but hi is own fault
Exactly. Other countries, other justice systems. Don't f up unless you are willing to pay the price. The Saudis would have cut his hand off.
Yay POTUS! THANK GOD OBAMA IS GONE!!! THANK YOU LORD!
And now he's dead. Probably Obamas fault too. God how are you even president
Wow, the apple didn't fall far from the tree Jr. A family lost their son and brother. Show some respect.
Oh liberals! He is merely pointing out how weak Obama was! How sick are you people to attack Trump for shedding light on this tragedy!
Thank god no one told you to keep quiet since you are so good at spilling state secrets between allies to the enemy.
how despicable to toot your own horn at the expense of grieving family.  SHAMELESS!
Fred Warmbier sent his son to North Korea, not Obama and his son committed a crime and had to do the time
Doing time does not mean having your brain fried and being murdered!
What in the hell do you know about doing time? You'd be surprised as to what happens
also @DonaldJTrumpJr when is your father going to fill the vacant of Special Envoy for Human Rights Issues in N. Korea?
Give me an F...give me a U...YOU GET THE PICTURE!!
Your fake need need a polishing there Jr, looking a little grubby.
A dead "hostage" isn't a win, sorry
Poor kid just passed away.  F' it, just get medieval on that vertically challenged North Korean pile of garbage.  Turn Pyongyang into carbon
Now we see they released him because he was just about dead and useless to them
Great job bringing home a dead American.

Obama admin + Sweden facilitates releases.  Same will occur for Trump.  Point is don't go there.  By getting us blaming each other NK wins.
So sorry Obama Admin was so thoughtless. Our prayers go out to you and your family.
Like Seth Rich family?
Trump didn't do shit! N Korea basically murdered him then dumped the body in America. Thinking nobody would figure out it was them.
That's action from obama and clintons that's how democrats treat Americans.
You're pure vermin.
Yes dear lord ranting Robin is at it today. I hope Don jr knows where the block button is this Robin is void of compassion
Guess better dead than never...
Why didn't you bring him home 135 days ago? North Korea is laughing at you!!!!
@realDonaldTrump and the other 3 Americans? Obama's fault too?
I believe that America must send a strong message to the North Korean people.
Way to be empathetic. My sympathies go out to this family.
Actually it was Bill Richardson and James Clapper ( Dems) who laid the groundwork while Daddy was diddling his Android, asshat. Get a clue
yep  they #NorthKorea     KILLED Otto ,    WHAT  r   WE going 2 do about it ??????????????????????????
Perhaps, if their son had observed the laws in N Korea in the first place rather than stealing, he would still be alive and well today.
You know he died though, right?
Obama has blood on his hands for this boy•Would he have left his daughters in there for 17 months without getting them out ?  NO!
This Dad that lost his son has every right in the world to feel and say anything he wants.  Why would he lie? Obama admin failed him.
Shame on you for using this family's tragedy to boost your fragile freaking ego in your constant comparison of yourself to President Obama
Thank you and your family for sacrificing to MAGA! The Americans who voted for your father appreciate it! 
You're just like your daddy, trying to benefit off of people's suffering, you have the empathy of a rock....pathetic
With the North Koreans you're damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't. No great feat of diplomacy here since he was no longer of value to them.
SO WHY DID THE FAKE LEADER AND DRAFT DODGER IN CHEIF LEAVE THE OTHERS THERE?
Kermit the frog
Not suprising at all that you would say something stupid.  Looking at who your father is it should not be suprising.
WTG TRUMP
FAKE NEWS!!!  Obama worked on it!  tRump did nothing!!!  Shifting the blame!!!
Donald DRUMPF JR is a LIAR just like his dad. No surprise. All of the family LIES & thinks of no one but themselves. Sick mental people
R.I.P. Otto.
Otto Warmbler is dead thanks to the worst president in U.S. history - Barack Obama. We need a special prosecutor to indict him.
Get your facts straight. Otto is dead because he broke the law in North Korea. When will America wake up!?
How sick.  You're more concerned about your father than Otto.
And now he's dead thanks to you. Congratulations!
I believe that Obama's Admin. did so much more in trying to get Otto released.  He's the one who started in trying to get Otto released from
@realDonaldTrump 22 old kid  How many more Americans mistreated in Korean prison sent home to die!Do something. Unacceptable
So he was alive until the @potus got involved. You people are sick. You have to go after the families, Trump said.
I for one think it was Dennis Rodman that did it..NOT YOU!  Shut up already!!
You had nothing to do with his release, tell his parents the truth.
Hmm... and, Daddy #Trump said the man that tortured Otto was a "smart cookie" that he'd "be honored to meet."
#ITMFA
But your father is a freaking liar though. So who cares what you have to say. #Covfefe
Sad to say, but his coma brought him home, not your administration, and certainly not your own work. They didn't want him to die in N. Korea
I wish Obama would done something sooner Otto he would still be with us but he did nothing Oh God control my tongue
Obama, the ultimate lunch President, is a authentic poseur and disaster!!!
Yes dead

I wasn't aware that this kid was on govt business. How abt those 7 Sailors that died this weekend? Stop abt this FOOL that went to NKorea
Thank you, President Trump, for bringing home Otto Warmbier!!
OMG wake up #follower #thinkforyourself  #impeachTrumpnow #ImpeachTrump
They need a Tomahawk house-call over there.
Did you just use a dead kid to boast about your accomplishments.   Classy guy.
He was brought back to die, so sad! May W.O. RIP; much sympathy to his parents.  Disgusting how our POTUS praised N.K. leadership! What now?
This is so sad on so many levels.
Self Righteous of Sir Trumpy a Family Bussiness King but President the Country so Better Then Pork Pollies Of Corruptions Weasels
screwed up order on my  tweets, who cares, right??
Obama failed miserably in this matter. Obama did So Much Harm to our country but NOTHING will hinder America's turn around to prosperity.
#Obama pardoned a convicted traitor his last day in office and left this white kid to rot in North Korea, says it all for his presidency.
So what's your dad gonna do?  Quit passing the buck.  Ottos death happened under daddy's watch!
check your fake news source
Seriously?  Taking credit for no work, once again. Pathetic.
You're despicable.
how bout if Otto complied with NK he wld still be alive, isnt that what you tell POC when they get shot by police, comply?
Stop using a "disgrace" for politic benefit for your father!!! Shame on you!!!!
Diplomacy is hard, asswipe. Sometimes, you just can't win. They likely only released him because he was dying.
Honored to meet Kim Jong Un...
You neglect to mention that the NK diplomats contacted the Trump State Department. They didn't want him to die imprisoned.
Obama brought home 10 people held in North Korea. He fought tirelessly.What about the 3 Americans currently being held? What's your problem?
If you are so good at bringing people in and negotiating, what about the other three americans?
And he's dead
Rip Otto.  However, Otto was an adult and the parents can't blame anyone.  Otto knew what NK was all about before he went there.  Period.
Maybe-maybe not but that is no excuse for that POS Obama to not negotiate for his release like he did for that deserter/traitor Bergdahl.
@realDonaldTrump @rcpvideo NK SENT him home to DIE!! Do something about it!
I thought you @DonaldJTrumpJr were to stay out of politics.
Shameful politicalization here.  RIP Otto.  We will remember this unforgivable tragedy.
LIAR.

And your father, Otto's president, says his Otto's murderer is a smart cookie. Yeah you are a family of moral rectitude. #OttoWarmbier
Oh, Otto was a stupid man!!! No a normal guy goes to North Korea! Very stupid!
Politicking this tragedy? No shame. Aren't you supposed to be out of politics and running a business? Get lost. Please and thank you.
Otto did not deserve to die, however how much money/resources were needed to bring home someone willingly going into North Korea?
Shut up!!
Wow, how 2nd grade of you.  What part do you not want to hear?
Any comments about the deceased sailors in the navy  ship .?
@realDonaldTrump @rcpvideo what happened to party of personal responsibility? Why Should our govt get involved?
