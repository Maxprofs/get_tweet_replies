Thank you very much.
Your place will be high even without any big proposal. 
#Charismatic #Trump
DROP OUT
Drop your opposition. If you are a civil person its time to work together. If not, leave!
don't tell me to leave because I don't support your candidate
leave the country if you don't like it
I love my country and that's why I don't want to country to go up in flames! Not for your candidate
It might either way, we are at a very painful growing pain in our history
the point is you can't tell me to leave our country because I don't support your candiate
Bravo! Ms. Marsha you are a symbol of Tennessee Pride! God Bless you! Thankyou!
@USAHipster @MarshaBlackburn Marsha is awesome!
Oh so innovative... Not!
It works for the RICH ONLY, and doesn't take into consideration father's who lost their wives
the other was lying about emails and her health  instead of just coming clean.
we love you President Donald TRUMP! Only you will put US citizens FIRST!

But there are no plan details correct?  It is all meaningless talk.
Advantage to higher income families, no paternity leave and questionable funding.
#nevertrump
Positive innovative ideas keep coming from Donald Trump v No ideas from Hillary Clinton
you do know that  @MarshaBlackburn us. lightweight, right? really lightweight
not every Tennessean is a bigoted Republican like Blackburn.
... Big deal! What the hell does she know? Not much! Sad!
I'm So Excited! Go Donald!
dumb c#$% #Hillary is way better... stupid #douchbags #donthecon won't be president DUH!! Enjoy that hater
Another RWNJ - You're attracting the laughables & deplorables!
Please check into child SUPPORT Reform. Men and women alike are so far in debt. We need justice over this.
your "childcare" is a joke, it offers nothing for those who really need it, it only benefits the rich

why not ? Hillary ?? Lol

Ivanka is FOS like her father: Trump Enterprises does not provide PAID maternity leave. More T-Rump BS!
You both shld take a look at HRCs better childcare prop that has been on website for a yr. Pandering much?

#TrumpPence2016 
Thank you, Gas Bag Blackburn! As stupid as Palin, but with a twang!
Just found out your organization doesn't offer paid maternity leave. #Sad
Really. Surprise. She is a republican hack. Could care less about woman or their families.
Rep.Blackburn is the greatest! I wish more Reps had her astuteness.Should be head of HHs.

DONALD THE MOVEMENT THANKS YOU FOR HAVING THE GUTS TO STAND UP FOR US
@tldb4 This would have made a HUGE difference for our family 16 years ago.


But doesn't ask where this money is coming from. DO SOME RESEARCH!
Climate change and evolution denier with absolutely no scientific background. You should be proud.
-Does Trump Corp. provide paid maternity leave - a topic near and dear to Ivanka's heart?
I think that if you make $250000 a year you can afford child care without tax credits.
shut up
Hey Donald! Release The Audit Letter U Liar

Applause from one windbag to another. Wasn't Sarah Palin, available?
Mr. Trump on behalf of my family thank you , for be a real American.  You have our full support.

you really want to support a LIAR? http://bit.ly/2cF1ka6 
Thank you Mr Trump. Now need serious education reform. Our schools are little more than childcare.
How are their investments handled? Let's just hope they are not through the "Clinton" charity fund...
Watch for the stock market to be over-loaded with anti-American investors ready to dump even at a loss...

Thanks Ivanka you R Trumps asset. Bill is Hilarys liability.
#OTrumpster Out of 248 Republican House members?
TRUMP says 6 weeks paid leave, all of a sudden out of nowhere, HC offers 12. HC  Follower much? YUP
:. THANK YOU, FOR UNDERSTANDING WOMEN & CHILDREN, TRUMP!

@KatrinaPierson @MarshaBlackburn  ag
lol..."innovative" does that mean benefits only wealthy Americans?  Hillary plan benefits middle class.
@ScaryMommy looks like one of the candidates has a viable plan on child care issues!
“As a Christian mom, I am horrified by what Trump says and does." - See more at: http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/trump-women-world-war-3#sthash.FxJnYmdG.dpuf …
Sorry Marsha, it is not a conservative plan.  It's more socialization of our country. Shame.
Not you. Surrogate tweet.
very proud to represent this district! #MAGA 
Awesome! And TRUE!

Great Newsweek story! LOL
I expect Rep Blackburn to support #WomensRights moving forward, including gov't paid leave for maternity.
The Ever-Lying Donald Trump. How can any sane person ever vote for a clown like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQueaSlvjCw …
Release your taxes!!

Glad to see our Reps taking a stand for freedom!
I agree with Marsha!

Marsha Marsha Marsha - what were you thinking!! Disgrace.

Innovative what a joke.  Most companies give 12 weeks leave. Tax cut for the poor = $0. They pay no taxes.

Hilary looking for Parkinson's medicine

LMAO, now you are posting no nothing small time GOP endorsements! #Desperate#ReleaseYourTaxReturns


.@realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn #DeplorablesForTrump lost the plot long time ago, if they ever had one#DumpTrump

Marsha was AWESOME !
Google Trump bragging on 9/11 "now that Towers down my bldg tallest in lower Manhattan!" Vile. Traitorous.
"innovative?" Third world countries have better...Hillarys proposed plan is also better...
a real deplorable hateful woman
here ya go. This is how I see ya
you mention to Marsha, you want to control and shut the internet down? You know she is fighting against it
I am not sure I can trust someone who takes praise by someone who loves Putin.or your veiw on policy.
support & push enables mothers to be confident knowing that there children are being watched "safely"daily
Marsha Blackburn is as ignorant as you are. #fail #NeverTrump @MarshaBlackburn
how many of Trump employees have this coverage?
when will you answer questions about three rape allegations against Trump.
Ha ha ha ha ha

Oh good grief Blackburn....She's almost as much of a flake as Bachmann.
This plan is useless for a low income parent. This plan is for parents in Ivanka's income bracket.
In fact, it's just the opposite.Did you even watch the speech?
how will you pay for this?

The same bigot who voted against extending violence against women legislation http://citizenjames72.blogspot.ca/2013/03/marsha-blackburn-racist-bigot-of.html …
