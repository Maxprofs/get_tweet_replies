You are the idiot who claimed that your Sex Life & STDs were your Vietnam.

How dare you criticize anyone else you COWARD!!
Keep Criticizing members of Congress.  It will only make Impeachment that much EASIER!!
Ugh, more Proof of Collusion...
Donnie, you will be 'crying like a baby" when they begin hauling you and your family off to Prison in orange Jumpsuits.
I wonder how well the jumpsuits will match your face....
And BTW he has every right to "Judge Collusion"  This is America and we have rights, remember that!!
i am going to defend Donald Trump on every platform!
no matter what happens!
You're one to talk about Vietnam. #VetsAgainstTrump
5 Draft Deferments, using your wealth and privilege to avoid fighting while others less "elite" were drafted. #VetsAgainstTrump
"He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured." - @realDonaldTrump
You fought to kick Vietnam Veteran street vendors off of 5th Avenue because you felt that Veterans made the street less "classy."
You attacked a Gold Star family, because they asked you to read the United States Constitution. #VetsAgainstTrump
You exploited a grief-stricken Gold Star Widow on national TV, using her as a political prop while her dead SEAL's Dad condemned you.
You took an un-earned Purple Heart medal, and bragged about how you "always wanted a Purple Heart... this is much easier."
You attacked Veterans with PTSD, saying that wounded warriors struggling with their experiences are "not strong."
Delete your account.
Seriously. This is an embarrassment. Undignified and unpresidented.
I am so ashamed he is our president. I don't even know what to say.
Cry like a baby? What is this, preschool for him?
This level of reactivity and impulsivity is disturbing. And dangerous in a president.
Every one here knows that Trump is the Best!
Then what is the point to discuss anything!!
Retweet if you agree that Trump is the bestest!
9 tweets already today. Where are your handlers? Yeh, keep telling us this is a working vaca while u sit there tweeting in your golf shorts.
I see you have started Trump Propaganda TV and are stealing the methods implemented by other famous dictators.
I must say, you don't know much, but you certainly have studied up on tyrants & the tools they use to squash the truth.
And for crying out loud, could you go one day without criticizing the very Constitution you vowed to uphold?
We get it...your walls are caving in. U have American laws on 1 side and Putin on the other. Hey, at least in prison Putin can't get to u.
I hear u r trying to get a taxpayer funded medical facility in NJ. You planning to resign due to *medical* reasons?
And once again this morning you are trying to claim you have great approval ratings. Good luck with that one.
Rest assured, one way or another, your supposed Presidency will be short.
are you admitting collusion?

That was my thought exactly: "So, you're saying there *was* collusion?"
That's what I read,too. "He lied, so how dare he criticize my collusion!?"

I don't get how this is spreading lies. He is stating what is in the president's tweet.
Especially when Trump himself does nothing BUT spread lies & disinformation. But they admire that. It's sick.

3 Years, 5 Months, 13 Days, 4 Hours, 58 Minutes, and 40 Seconds
Until my Second term
You wish!
The President actually replying to tweets. You win sir!
That isn't actually him, it's a parody account.
Nope it's him creeping around... 
A parody of a parody... that fits
Ironic that his catch phrase is what we will be trying to do after he is out! Make America Great again after Trumpnado
Who's worse? Blumenthal who lied about his service, or John Kerry who condemned the brave men that fought in Vietnam?
The number of dems that have total disdain for our vets is unbelievable
The Failing NYTimes and WaPo should not be allowed to conduct domestic espionage under the guise of "Journalism"
It's amazing how many Russian bots are retweeting your tweets and leaving comments on them and....
you claim that you didn't collude with Russia.  Ummm, yeah right!
hey I love trump!
he is the best!!
no one can replace him!!
trump Tank rock!!
No matter what happens!
But you were brave right? .. funny I can't find a picture of you in military uniform?  except this one, but that doesn't count 
Here's some uniform pictures , this is what you wore during Vietnam isn't it?
Yeah ... that right , I remember ... bone spurs right? Glad to hear sports didn't aggravate that 
Well at least you didn't get over there and get caught huh? You were smarter then that, your plan was full proof
Sorry you couldn't serve, I hear you really wanted to - well, at least you can play dress up so you feel like you did 
Don't forget. He surrounds himself with generals as a backdrop to insist he fits in. Pathetic.
Nice to see Melania's Anti-Bullying Campaign coming together from the top down.
When did speaking the truth become bullying?
Facts like "never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like..."?The point is to be a bully and project his own issues.
Why? Do you know someone who lied more?
Dennis Hastert. John Edwards. Weiner. Strom Thurmond. Bill Clinton. Just off the top of my head.
You do realise Trump averages more than 2 public lies a day & has lied more than 450 times  in public since taking office.
Which ones?
The internet is difficult to navigate, so here http://bfy.tw/DF5Y 
#Unfit #Unhinged #Unbelievable
Looks like General Kelly's influence lasted about a week.
Mr. President, if you don’t want your base to think you’re on a 17 day vacation, just call Bedminster “the Jersey White House.”
Everyone else in Washington the Senate Congress went on vacation is he not allowed to do the same
Then why does he keep insisting he's working?
Because he is always working just like me with my job even when I'm off I'm working thinking about things I need to do planning out things
Obama run off to Hawaii every time he turned around no one said anything it's like trumps not allowed to do anything
We're not even paying him to do this job he's done it for the American people give him a break my goodness
My father was a POW in Korea for 33 1/2 months when released He weighted 79 pounds. Lied about his age to get in while Trump lied tostay out
You it's interesting. John P Sousa lied about his age & I think joined the Navy. He was 14-15.  Later he was a member of the US Marine Band
My father was not there a month and was ambushed in a valley shot in the shoulder he was part of the death march built own prison camp
A true hero. Our heroes stories all need to be told. Draft dodging Duh-nald will never understand or be heroic.
My two uncles (brothers) were both stationed at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked.  One barely made it, one died. Trump is a disgrace.
How very sad we have all these Brave men and women who sacrificed it all for freedom and a Pres who did everything to get out of it. Sad
You said not getting STDs was your personal Vietnam. How brave to dodge the draft because your little bones hurt.
Your tweets are being archived... you're going down in history as the whiniest little bitch ever hahaha
You're crying like a baby on twitter right now... pot calling the kettle
Psalm 149:4
For the #Lord takes #pleasure in His #people; He will beautify the #humble with #salvation.
Philippians 4:13
I can do all #things through #Christ who #strengthens me.
I'm a Trump guy, but seriously u can stop posting the same shit after EVERY fuckin tweet. U R quite seriously not helping the cause at all.
Not sure what a Trump guy means but glad u called him out. I may despise him but want the country safe & unity. His big mouth is a problem.



Remember he has done no business or made money in Russia. Tax returns please
No he just owes them money from m all the loans they've given him.
Right.  And then there's this...
I thought you said you were *busy working* in NJ. is this that work?
Exactly. Work = watching the news and whining like a toddler because someone hurt is sensitive feelings
It's raining. He can't "work" on the 18 holes... so he's going to watch tv and be an idiot on Twitter all day instead.
Since it's raining he SHOULD golf We might get lucky lol
Need some lightening to make that happen. One could only hope.
 we can only hope for Lightening to Strike!!
Good lord. This is so petty and sad. Just be a man and own up.
Sounds like the president of the united states needs a juice box and a nap.
Nope, it's raining and no golf today-he's angry and at a loss for what to do. Maybe spend time with Baron?
Or his wife?... Never has there been a modern president who has so actively snubbed his own spouse.
And she couldn't appreciate that more. Think of all the time saved not flinching every second.
This is true haha
it must be very reassuring to you followers that you have spent 59 days of your 1st 212 in office golfing when you attacked obama 4 golfing
It must also be very reassuring to them that each day you spendgolfing at trump resorts costs them 1.5 mill roughly, adding up 2 88.5mill
it must also be very reassuring to Blumenthal that he is indeed doing a good job, anyone you attack has to be relieved because you are EVIL
Holy shit @realDonaldTrump Golf ball through a garden hose style. 
"Why does the truth hurt?"
-@realDonaldTrump 
#ClenchedFistOfTruth
#Trump taking shots at another Vet. What a "Joke"
I know what you mean. I try not to dislike anyone. But #Trump ......he's simply unlikable.
That's because trolls are unlikable
And Trump is a common vile AltRight Twitter troll.


I would much rather have an elected official who lied about the extent of their service than 1 who lied 2 the government 2get out of serving
You really didn't win. You know it. You had voter suppression, foreign espionage and an Antiquated EC designed when we had 13 colonies.
Back then slave votes were claimed in the south. You wanted to #Abolishtheelectoralcollege until it got you a win. You didn't think you
Russia because Putin was afraid of HRC and not you! The Irony that a fraud and a bully tyrant was not feared by Putin is not lost on us..
Your campaign and Admin is filled with those who colluded for this Capitalist coup.  #StopTheCoup #Stolenelection
He cried like a baby? Didn't you beg Mexico to lie about paying for the stupid wall ? Who is the one pulling temper tantrums on twitter ?
Everytime you lose at something you bad mouth people with your lies and bullying.  You are the Baby! 
He apologized . Have you ever ?
Trump shut it, now. Your personal Vietnam War? Avoiding STD's.  A draft dodging loser
He was an entertainer on Howard Stern. He wasn't planning on running for pres at that time. U guys act like this is on CNN #Fakenews
Forgot ... real news Trump was a 15 star General
He's told us exactly what he is over and over and over. Yet ppl still voted for the filthy pig. #TrumpRussia
Keep fighting back! In our great history, forces have never worked so hard AGAINST an elected @POTUS DRAIN THEM #DraintheSwamp #IWILLDEFEND
Failing dem party is on its last leg.
 Let's band together and kick it out from underneath them in 2018. Vote them out of existence
Pathetic failures in everything they try to accomplish...no wonder their at an all time low and sinking fast..lots are jumping ship
They're.
Mr President @Twitter suspended Nicole account.. meanwhile thousands of accounts calling for your assassination stills up. Let that sink in
*facepalm* you're beyond help
This is painful watching you melt down. Someone put on cartoons for him so he can stop whining. General Kelly... hello...
No meltdown except perhaps Russian investigation.
Opinion | The quest to prove collusion is crumbling http://wapo.st/2v2za1c?tid=ss_tw-bottom&utm_term=.fe07b0417a87 …
Look I pray for Americas sake nothing shows up... it's not about the investigation my friend. It's about representing the whole country.
I'm pretty sure the president is the president of everyone in the country. Left and right and center. He should lead by example.
He should indeed. No one w/ a conscience will follow the kind of example he sets, however.
I just want this country to survive this. And if getting behind him made him fly right and carry us with pride I'd do it. But it doesn't.
So neither of you are war heroes. The difference is that Blumenthal never mocked POWs
Or said not getting STDs in the 80s was his "personal Vietnam"
Or viciously attacked gold star families
Guess what, Trump still got elected. Get over it.
My gosh did you see how many times he tweeted this morning? Holy crap he's a freaking lunatic. Its like paranoid schizophrenia..??
Seriously like those poor homeless on street with imaginary visions...except now he's trying to encompass everything & every one against him
If one person, has that much control over your life maybe it's time to sit down and reevaluate your situation. All you people do is complain
I think you need to replace the you with Trump in every part of your sentence
He's gonna tweet a ton, no golf today, it's a rainy day here in NJ.
Someone needs to get him some finger paints or something
It seems the only time he's happy are when golfing or making the moves on a young woman.

Immediately after tweeting about hard you are working, you spent a half hour tweeting about shit u saw on TV. Not even trying anymore. Sad!
FYI Trump. In case u didn't get the memo, tantrums r for children. Someone please get him some big boy pants & out of his underroos.

I know he's come under a lot of flack but I think this finally might be the thing that makes him resign Fran
There you go being unsurprisingly unpresidential in a very 'unpresidented' manner
Then Why do the DEMOCRATS & RINO'S get away with BREAKING the LAW? We the PEOPLE are putting a STOP to this!
Trump has emerged as the most frequent liar on social media & TV so he shouldn’t really be pointing fingers at anyone.
Most recent instances are the calls he claimed to have received from Boy Scouts and Mexican President, both of which never happened.
As for collusion, the possibility arose from Russia's election meddling to defeat Hillary & Trump team's undisclosed meetings w/Russians.
The list of this President's lies & scandals is way longer than any achievements he might claim in office.
I would beg to differ. Trump's achievements are real, the scandals are media fiction
I am a veteran, you chicken hawk piece of trash. You have no room to talk. The only service you had was avoiding STDs

My favorite Trump meme of all!!! I almost want a tattoo of it.
And it seems he just admitted to collusion...
You don't get to talk about someone who actually served when you had 5 deferments, including one for bone spurs.

Christians don't. The people who do can call themselves anything they want; doesn't make it true.
Bunch of whiney snowflakes !  How would y'all know what God and Christians want you know neither of them!
Hahaha. So much irony in that statement.
Do not stop tweeting, @realDonaldTrump. #MAGA
Looks like he found where Kelly hid the phone.
"Sorry, Mr. Wilson. " -Dennis
I have a toddler, if I turn away for one second everything goes to shit. I know what Kelly is going through
Same. Also never thought I'd see a spoiled child as president.
That's mean to all the spoiled children they're not even is bad as trumplethinskin
You're really playing the dozens on Twitter for the world 2 see. You're a mentally unstable manchild, no dignity, integrity, or self-control
"It was all a lie":


#44 failed blacks... People were do  happy to have a blk President and a free phone.
My vote will never go to the Democrats again
...sexual conquests, how rich he was, and it was all a lie. He acted like a baby and begged for fake Ru bots. Now he judges collusion?
Remember when you dodged the draft entirely because of a bone spur? A bone spur...

You are a disgrace to the office of POTUS, a flaming embarrassment to the nation, no, to the entire world!
Has your account been hacked by a 12 year old? Your supporters dismiss this as you "punching back," but it's embarrassing.
"Cried like a baby?" Seriously, what adult speaks like this man? Also, fact check--you're lying. Again. Such an embarrassment
Did you say 'Lie?' Nice of you to acknowledge your best buddy, you never met one you weren't willing to tell!
James Clark is a gaslighting bot
So ... what time is your tee time today so we can have some idea when the bullsh*t is going 2 stop?  And r you sure those bone spurs are ok?
I hear it's rainy in NJ today. Gonna be a Twitler rageathon.
Ah that explains it.
Nice propaganda, Donald.
WATCH: @kayleighmcenany left CNN yesterday....today, she made her debut on Trump TV sharing "the real news". 
Your rediculous....lmao. and no back up statement with facts
OK, “Susan”.

Mcmaster gave susan rice her security clearence again/said she did nothing wrong.why is classified unmasking info in obama library for 5 yrs
How many tears did you shed over your imaginary bone spurs? A man with 5 faux deferments doesn't get to judge anyone's military service.
Yep.
You're an embarrassment to your country. Never has the world seen  such displays of disrespect and emotional insecurity from a world leader.
Trump is disgraceful...I will be so happy when this nightmare Presidency is over...impeach this crook
Man, thank God you don't have a country to run or anything important to do. Imagine if you were president and you Tweeted crap like this?

Comey testified trump was never a suspect- whys comey trying to pay50k- fake dossiers&leaking classified info.why/unless framin non suspect?
Every tweet you post makes you look pathetic and weak. You could learn so much about being Presidential by looking at @BarackObama tweets.
For someone who claims he doesn't watch @CNN you sure react to their news coverage A LOT!
Important to remember that fear, poverty, & mistrust are 3 of trump's greatest friends. It's our job to fight all 3 w/ decency and honesty.
A psychotic attempt to smear a reputable man.  Trump is a corrupt, treasonous, money laundering traitor
So, you are admitting your collusion? Excellent. Let's get on with impeachment and jail. Traitor!
So, there was collusion!  Cut to the chase..resign.
You mean like how you shamefully begged the President of Mexico not to say they wouldn't pay for your wall?
Mr President, did you just admit to collusion? Didn't you mean to add "alleged" between "judges" & "collusion"?
Thanks for admitting collusion, btw. #ImpeachTrump
