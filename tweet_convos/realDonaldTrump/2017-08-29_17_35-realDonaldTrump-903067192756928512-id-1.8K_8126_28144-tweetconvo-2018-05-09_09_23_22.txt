Too bad you didn't stop by and visit Donny! Too bad you didn't bother to visit any of Corpus Christi or the surrounding areas!
Oh yes another proud Democrat!
Let me guess, you're a brain dead supporter?
Another brain dead person bringing up Hillary to something that has nothing to do with her.
Oh I bet if I go through your TL, there's pissing and moaning about Obama even after he's been out of office!
Btw, this sorry ass was one of those service members you so much support! You're welcome
3 Years, 4 Months, 20 Days, 15 Hours, 30 Minutes, and 29 Seconds
Until I get inaugurated AGAIN!
Luckily you won't even last through the 1st four years!
If you're invoking God you should be praying for the Harvey victims not just a sick slant against the President.
You're actually praying that the President of the United States fails. 
Are you proud.??
Great effort Don...! At least they know what they are supposed to be doing in contrast to you...
#fakePresident
#TrumpOfTheDay
You know what? Overall she did a great job since 2005.we still have a strong free press, strong courts, prosperity & other fake-free things!
Don't mistake my free world with your bubble. The only one loured in autocratic and uneducated narrative is you, pumpkin. Peace out.
Pity you weren't there for the record numbers of Veterans taking their own lives !
Great idea!
Awesome to see great job guys!


GOD BLESS YOU ALL 

Fighting for hard working Middle Class Americans like me! Best President ever! MAGA Go Trump! 7 more years of greatness!!  my @POTUS !
Thank you to the VA and Secretary Shulkin

President Obama made a great pick in Shulkin!   Thank you for "holding over" to help the USA!
Please ask Trump why he blocked a Veterans Group representing 500,000 vets just for speaking out to Protect #Medicaid + health care!
Because he's a pussy
ONE Mobile Vet Center? In TEXAS? There are 1.7 MILLION Vets there-only 2nd to Cali w/ approx 2 http://MIL.You 're not fooling anyone
And it's in Corpus Christi, not Houston
تبيع سيارتك !!!

.@realDonaldTrump "Harvey. It sounds like such an innocent name, but isn't." 

Close your eyes. Open a telephone directory. Point at the page. Open your eyes. That's the name of the person who could do better than this. https://twitter.com/JTiloveTX/status/902629139815043072 …

But the Tax Bill takes away deductions for losses experienced via Hurricanes (Florida & Houston Texas) & Fires California. All so Billionaires can have more money?!?
There's evidence that ASPCA Houston sent pets out of town & put up for adoption. A lady had to go to new family in Austin to retrieve a pet.
You don't care about anything but money, wonder how much you are going to make off this
Its impossible to make money off a mobile vet care center legit we have to spend money to operate it so how will he make money you sounddumb
Can you provide proof that trump is building these and selling them and its basically just a decked out rv anyone with some money can
Much better than 5 days of Obozo dancing on a golf course while coffins floated. Killary make it to LA yet? #MAGA #HEISMYPRESIDENT
I am a veteran, though I wasn't impacted I still need help. Please share or donate. Thank you
And yet you consistently black Vets on your tweets.
Brilliant!
On Obama's watch Vets would have waited in line, or waded, for 72 hours or until they drowned.  Opioids would've been provided for comfort.
All he did was retweet but ok
Draft dodger
He's No draft dodger.... as if you'd know what that was!! Obozo and Clinton (either 1) ever served! !!

#CrookedDonald 'a trying to obstruct justice - Again!
A day after Grassley says Don Jr will testify for House Judiciary, Trump calls Grassley to promise him favorable ethanol legislation. GRAFT.

Donald, you don't have a clue. Please shut up.

World's Record!!
Better than his inauguration he shouldn't be happy
Pop in & get those bone spurs seen to former Kadet Skool tool @realDonaldTrump

Thank you so much , for those who cannot speak and are usually forgotten
Thank you.
Best president in my lifetime!
45th best President ever
Thank u 4 being a man of your word
He has no word he’s a pathological liar
1 Center 4 all Damaged areas N Texas? All these PICS being posted 4 Scrapbook! What about ACTIONS! Where's Vets getting help? OIC NONE!
As a Vet, I'd prefer to see you help everyone and not just Vets
They do. 
RT @SecShulkin: Our Mobile Vet Center set up and ready to help #Veterans impacted by #HurricaneHarvey in Corpus Christi....
Bone. Spurs.
He gave a shout-out to somebody trying to help and you bring that up for no good reason? Just grasping at straws
Because everyday citizens are doing more for Harvey victims than Donald Trump, who cut FEMA funding...
Looks like federal aid is doing fine regardless. Besides, that's the point. Everyday people coming together. And he went there. Thats enough

How is the Trump family business helping out?  #impeach
Are these *vets* "heeling"?? (like a dog?) 
@realDonaldTrump just found out there was one when u posted this.  He is so pathetic

then you wouldn't support a draft dodger who puts foreign interest above ours
I am continually asked why we don't give trump credit for helping vets. Here is why 
No, would not. I would support him if he were to resign
God Bless you 

Thanks to everyone for helping us, it's much appreciated
President Trump did hundred and more percent a good darn job, get over it losers he is now our President suck it up braindeads.
I KNEW Vets were better than regular doctors! Grampa was right! omg good for u guys, still funny...
@realDonaldTrump
New Fox News poll finds 56% of Americans think Donald is 'tearing the country apart.' Accurate.

Not even they can put lipstick on this pig.
2). if the cartels tortue them for American intelligence that they can SELL to our enemies?  Information will pay more than DRUGS!!!
Have more than one?
I love you guys

corupt government keeps injured vets money. gov orders drs to lie about vets abilities&time of injury.result-vets starves,homeless vets die!
“What a crowd, what a turnout”: Trump boasts of crowd size during Hurricane Harvey tour
Remember this ,the silent majority when pushed too far will fight back. You dumbocrats need to remember this.

President Donald John Tweet, why do you block the tweets of Vets? Are you not willing to hear what Our Vets have to say? SAD

This is great!!!
The Truth About the Hurracane Harvey: https://lastdayswatchman.blogspot.ca/2017/08/judgment-on-houston-and-warning-to.html …

Think about it, please.

We could use your leadership in Boston VAMC please
The Vietnam Vets started this for us vets and are their own entity. The veterans adm. sends them where needed, not the POTUS.
Looks like it is on dry land, it is needed where it is flooded
@realDonaldTrump ..now send  about 140,000 +mobile homes, free health care,taxes the rich bigly 
you'er  be great again
HOUSTON... the majority of the damage is in FUCKING HOUSTON...
WOW, set up in only 5 days. Couldn't find the keys? Now, how about you park it where there's some people. Doesn't look like a busy spot.
Now if Trump culd pay for the gas but alas. Don't think that far ahead? Typical.
HILLARY CLITON SHOULD DONATE HER BOOK CALLED "WHAT HAPPENED" FOR TOLIET PAPER FOR HOUSTON TEXAS 
That's wonderful news.
Help on site is very good, take note of climate protection is much better!
Wow.  One whole trailer....and is it fair to discriminate who gets help in this sort of disaster?
Is their going to health care for houston Texas kkkhazar Edomites pilgrim cowboy European Roman illuminati baphomet ram people ywoim yahusha

Trump,ur the man!!! MAGA!!
@VAVetBenefits how many veteran suicides were there #today @hurricanesarahx #HurricaneHarvey #weathermodification @skepticalraptor #StNick

One? We have one freaking RV, and that's the whole mobile vet center?
Thank you for thinking of the Little Critters and the many hundreds of pets that were left behind
This is amazing! Great job!
The @HouseGOP may cut ~$1 billion from disaster funds to pay for Trump's wall http://apne.ws/mIcJW2P  #p2

NOPE @speakerryan @housedemocrats
Glad you also think about the animals. Good job.
I LIKE THE IDEA THAT VETS ARE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF FIRST THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR ANIMALS LOVE IT BUT THEN SENIORS XO
Perhaps, offer this as shelter for flood victims?
What say you? Big guy
this is a good idea...I hope more of these will be seen in the near future...some vets have probs reaching facilities
Sounds like the snowflakes are starting to fly...lol.
Keep up the GREAT work Mr. President!!!!
#MAGA #AmericaFirst
How many VETS are impacting IN Corpus Christi? #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachPence #NarcissisticDonald
They are in CC but most destruction in Houston. Good thing it's mobile.

Make sure that you watch the coverage of all of the average Americans helping as well, these are the people that you are shaming every day
Delusional Donnie hates our vets-cuts suicide prevention$ help for homeless/hungry vets child care, wants them to pay for their own GI Bill!
Delusional Donnie cuts job retraining, health care, sends brave warfighters in w/o backup, intel, plans ignores lost sailors/dishonors them
Delusional Donnie bilks vets donations, blocks vets on Twitter, embarrasses America@ home &abroad unpatriotic UnAmerican
vets deserve better
Oh your a poet
@realDonaldTrump , you're the worst @POTUS in US history. Thankfully there are great people ready to provide real help.
Donald, you need to seek help!
Eric Trump on TV saying that Donald Trump is at RISK OF SUICIDE because of criticism. NOT A JOKE.

"Bone spur" Draft Dodger Donald Trump. Hypocrite. Narcissist. Me me me is Trump's way #VetsDeserveBetter #TrumpLiesMatter  #FoxAndFriends
Just vets

Of course that orange POS is taking credit for this happening too.
Shit I thought it were actual vets going to treat hurt animals, but it's just the PTSD loonies haha
YOU witnessed #HurricaneHarvey first hand??
I traveled with the President yesterday. Personally, I would not claim to have seen Harvey's horror and devastation first hand. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/902881712010653697 …
Hey, Donnie, have you donated any personal money to help vets--or anyone--with this disaster relief yet?
#WhatACrowdWhatATurnout
