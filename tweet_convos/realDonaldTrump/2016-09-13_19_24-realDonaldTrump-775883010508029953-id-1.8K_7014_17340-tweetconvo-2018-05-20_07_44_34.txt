Talk about the Iran deal and the latest surprise the lifting of sanctions on 2 banks 7 years early in the Iran deal
THIS WILL SAVE THE UNBORN, WOMEN WILL HAVE A REAL CHOICE TO GIVE LIFE. MAY GOD BLESS AND PROTECT YOU

We must see you support MrTrump. Hillary has used old news to gain ground. HRC has nothing to offer Americans
this does not include adopted children
YOU ARE FORGIVEN, BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN NOW. THE ACTIONS SINCE HAVE PROVED GOD HAS HIS HIS HAND ON YOU. FEAR NOT!
This is a hoax site - best to block.
@IvankaTrump I have been in the child care industry in the Wichita, KS area, off and on, since 2000.

@IvankaTrump I think your plans are wonderful. I sincerely hope that there is follow through.
Trump plan hits Clinton from all sides

.@whatyoucrave .@realDonaldTrump Donald was sued and lost in the 70's for denying black applicants from renting in his apartment buildings.
check your facts. He didn't lose.
.@whatyoucrave @realDonaldTrump Yes he did!  He had to pay fines, buy billboards in black communities, take out ads in black publications.
he settled, and agreed to put up billboards and ads that anyone was welcome. Because they were.
.@whatyoucrave @realDonaldTrump Donald called black people genetically lazy and only wants the guys wearing yarmulkes counting his money.
that's just not true.
@IvankaTrump I have often told my staff, "We have the most important job in the world, with the least pay and respect.
@IvankaTrump @KellyannePolls Please consider reintroducing this to the American People in some way. Will help with women!
GRAB HER PUSSY
So Democrat, who's  paying? Yea taxpayers
@IvankaTrump God bless you for seeing the need.  If you ever need perspective from the Kansas area, just let me know.
There are plenty of YouTube Videos on HRC history from Goldwater days. USE THEM. WAKE UP or HRC will be POTUS

@IvankaTrump We often spend more time with these children than their parents or family.
@IvankaTrump And from the other side, when the child care facilities can't afford to pay quality teachers what they deserve
@IvankaTrump Especially, when they are truly trying, but just can't do it(even with public assistance).
PAUL WHO WTOTE 5 BOOKS OF THE BIBLE HAD A PAST  BE GOD SAVED HIM AND PUT HIM ON A NEW COURSE. CHRISTAINS REMBER THAT
@IvankaTrump than having to dis-enroll a child(ren) of a low income family or single mother due to their inability to pay.
AMERICA IS GREAT. YOU INSULT ALL OF US. PAY BACK TAXES
obamacare
Good luck tonight Mr Trump. Stay calm, & stay focused on the questions. The more you stay calm the more she will get pissed
@cnnbrk @SarahPalinUSA true get rid of waste $$ government spends. Plenty of money for tax credits!!! Go Trump!!!
@IvankaTrump I have worked from a teacher to administrator.   There is nothing more heart breaking
@TeamTrump with the temperament of a 5 year old, Trump would benefit the most from his child care plan. Sad.
NOT EVEN CLOSE
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @mashable
no. No they won't.
you're being sued for raping a child. Don't talk about caring for children.
Didn't realised "sued for" was another meaning for "guilty". Thanks for that
no problem. I'd be inclined to take with a grain of salt had his ex-wife not testified that he raped her.
You mean his ex wife, the *adult*. Nice try with the deflection.
he only raped an adult? Phew. Sorry for deflection.
are logical fallacies all you got? You used example to link to *child* policy. You collapsed your own argument
.@realDonaldTrump Every father will be required to wish they could date their daughter and have sex in common with them. The Trump Way!
Nasty minds
I bet that's the same man who speculated on the size of his infant daughter's chest! 
who cares
Delete your account.
delete yours first
I never cease to be stunned by republicans who are willing to vote for a liberal progressive because...a wall. Smh
A wall that will NEVER be built and one that Trump keeps flip flopping on...
Truth!
This is not conservative.   Kids belong with  a parent . Making daycare cheaper is not the way to go.
he also offered same credit to mom's who stay home.
Better, but still waste of tax money.  Lower taxes for everyone.
I have 4 kids but still don't like this.  Thanks for the correction, though
.
not cool! I DETEST Trump, but this talk is irresponsible. HC wouldn't want you to say those things. IJS
yes, I realize this is Twitter, but I'm also a woman so hate to see sick attacks against his daughter. Stick to facts. Please
aight Derek... You don't have to like the man's politics or even like him, but it's not OKAY to accuse him of incest! I'm out
Great decision for parents raising kids. Although Killary & media r needlessly tearing u apart 4 it! They're just Trash!!!
Jordi you get off my page! Go find your own Supporters for funds and leave Trumpsters alone-got it??
Ok all good; we've had a few fraudsters come in and want donations; My Focus is Electing Mr Trump as President!!
I agree.  Our account is being altered by Twitter and generally they're censoring Trump supporters.  :(
Hmm haven't come across it yet but will retweet you for others to be mindful-Crkd Hillary, 'Mafia Bill' are Evil!

I would love to talk to you about my product, and licenseing
What would you propose for child rapists? Would it apply to you, too? #TrumpHole
LYING TRUMP you DNT do it and called  inconvenient to have pregnant women at your company
@pink_sprnva man libs working overtime trying to find something wrong
childcare? Or in bed with daughter cuddling her like a lover. Covered how
good idea.

falling short on this one buddy.
Is Ivanka feeling OK?  She looks gaunt.
not a fan of cash back that isn't due. That is 'redistribution'
The wealthy don't need tax credits for childcare. Make childcare more affordable for the low- and middle-class!
@gmiller1952 He is a politician. Buy votes. No flat tax? No closing the IRS? Department of Education?
sometimes in life you have to make choices. Hope you make a good choice! 
There is no other choice. It is the Donald.
God bless he doesn't let us down! I don't think he will! 
And who us going to pay for all this trump "greatness". Oh yah he's a billionaire he can pay for it
The media makes it sexist if u do sexist  if u don't. Don't they have anything positive about hillary to talk about. Crazy
Who's Paying for this #ChildCare? 
Mom took care of 6 of us kids . 
We don't need more #Gov.Programs
It falls on #Taxpayer
I think you meant CHILD CARE REFORMS THAT WILL MAKE IVANKA'S RICH FRIENDS EVEN RICHER.

Half baked and #lame.  Didn't we already see you admit to not liking babies?  #Deplorable #BabyHater #Dictator
You mean socialist programs to Make America Nazi.
What the hell do you know about child care?
Mr. Trump, please stop stepping in it. For once, enjoy being ahead. It's too close now to test the vote.
@IvankaTrump 
Here 
I know you didn't start the birther movements
out of curiosity where was #AmericaGreat???
@IvankaTrump Way to hate gays Donnie shows u don't stop at Mexicans Muslims or Jews u just power through everyone with hate
@IvankaTrump  perhaps if ur in the wealthy category, lower and middle class won't get bumpus!
ignore the "haters" they are fueled by ignorance and too stupid to even realize it. Sad that people so ignorant can vote.
It appears that the #trump child care plan is fundamentally flawed and unconstitutional. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/09/16/trumps-maternity-leave-plan-is-unconstitutional-sex-discrimination/?utm_term=.04cb99d6d95e …
I've heard from many "Credible Sources" that Trump is not Credible. @maddow
Leave the Hitler youth at home..you know your kids.  BELIEVE ME
u got all your supporters fooled I c right threw u u don't know how to make America great
that your mane words an you still haven't gotten a plan ... u be the worst president ever. ...
@newtgingrich just call it like it is Trump is a scam artist and in the end voters will not buy it despite "his policies"
Ivanka, when did you decide to run for President? I was not aware of a family member being able to make policy
a lot of talk, but nothing said!
@IvankaTrump   Eww, you are disgusting.

http://Iwillvote.com 
I know of women who have to choose to stay unemployed because the cost of child care is greater than what they can earn !
it's sad to live in America and have more Americans dislike you than Americans that like you I think you got your family!!
Your daughter didn't even provide paid maternity leave.  All Trumps including the immigrant R HYPOCRITES

I have grandchildren so that does not help me but with the elderly care, my mom is 94, good for us!
- and makes sure men can't be involved in #childcare Thanks! Much better than @HillaryClinton plan to help entire families
You can thank your @GOP and @TPPatriots for actively blocking any child care policy changes!
Disastrous and mostly false as usual
Mr. Trump, if Ivanka pushes you any further left you will be the progressive in this race.
We need better family policies here in Europe too. I hope the world learns from your success. Congrats for your proposals.
where did this say a thing about childcare reform? You certainly are a master of deflection.
less money for businesses to pay employees, or expand, another reason to leave USA
so that's how you plan on reducing the size of government? you know businesses are going to pay for this iresponsible plan
how is this different from FMLA?
why don't you drop out now?
here's a, free song I did. Its, an original. https://youtu.be/3FxuHAeZGiM  if you like what you hear join me on fb for more fun.
labor has concerns. comfortable walking shoes.
This is great -is there anything also for moms who stay at home with their children @ want to work from home?
why dont you offer this to your own employees most jobs already offer it @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @TexDem16 @Dem4Hillary @ScottNevins

@PARISDENNARD  Do you provide these benefits to your current employees already? (Since you believe in your plan and all)
@IvankaTrump Donnie & Marie or Millie Vanilli team? The plagiarizers WHOSE been teaching U, Russsian Mommy @MELANIATRUMP ?
@IvankaTrump paternity leave helps all dads, by leaving it out you are saying child rearing is solely a woman's job
@IvankaTrump absolute stupidity , paternity leave helps all adoptive parents. Why would you hurt these kids
family and women's rights. Having and nurturing children while balancing everything is what makes us awesome
once I started having kids is when I noticed that the system was against families.
it's a starting point. tax credit for whichever parent stays home with the kids Many females are the breadwinner now
Your hands look really small on tv!!!!!!!
What about same sex male parents? No paternity leave?
Epic fail with the Cosmo interview.  Terrible plan anyway.
divorce & prove they did,live 105 yards away,with seperate addresses this is so so WRONG that we dont support marriage
also if 2 elderly on medicare get married if barely over base they both cant keep there medicare 1 loses it or they have 2-
welfare is for aid not to have babies,sit on your butt & everyone else pay 4 there kids,not suppose 2 b 4 income like itis
only 3 republicans like it...hummm not good.
families who lost a spouse during war not to be a means of income,folks have wrong impression what the help was started 4
pay 4 2 only & then offer education its not suppose to b for unwedded single parents wasnt it desined during war 2 care 4 -
We alsoneed to promote marriage  and stop the gov.4 trying 2 destroy  it Limit how many kids we pay 4,illegitamate kids 2
finally a benefit by the United States for the working class taxpayer
ha ha so funny republicans must be having fits just wait and see
@Lrihendry Cradle to grave benefits? That's not nationalism, it's liberalism!
#DonaldJTrumpforPresident, #Trump2016, #AlwaysTrump,
@Lrihendry stop with all the promises! Your going to lose me for sure!
#tax break for the wealthy! Yeah tax break for my nanny
I'm still voting for you even if some of your ideas will create more debt. We can't have socialism!
@IvankaTrump ~ just saw your Megan Kelly interview. You are poise personified. Glad your father has you in his corner.KUTGW
LONG LONG OVER DUE WOMENS LIVES MATTER WHERE ARE THOSE SIGNS???
Hillary is ready for the 2016 Presidential Debates. No more face plants
awesome #makeAmericagreatagain TrumpPence16
ALL WE NEED DO IS LOOK AT YOUR OWN KIDS AND DISCOVER WHO WAS MOTHER AND WHERE SHE AT NOW?
Lying abt Hillary's more substl prog for both parents so women aren't discrim'd against as only recipients sux
We need you DONALD Trump! Best leader we will have.  
@IvankaTrump but only for "the little wife" not for men right.

@IvankaTrump bravo Ivanka samo napred.  Pobjedite :)
@Ivanka Trump seriously? Who does this really benefit....your friends? Not working class people
For the rich only....what about the rest of the country? Oh, I forgot...you don't care about them...
check out federation for American Immigration reform, America needs to know it's much worse be tough on illegals
Release your taxes cheater. You don't know any thing about childcare.
Hillary had the childcare policy before you and your "brilliant" spawn, Ivanka. You're such a liar and fraud. Deplorable!
Yes - this child care plan is AWESOME - here is how to explain it
@IvankaTrump What a joke. Pretending to care about women.
Drumpf is only out for Drumpf
@IvankaTrump How can @realDonaldTrump care about women when asked if sexually harassed a woman should find another job.
@IvankaTrump 
Go back to your golden toilet.
http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/ivanka-ignores-facts-on-dads-maternity-leave-policy.html?mid=twitter_nymag …
@IvankaTrump Ideal for many - Job sharing for stay-home moms as well as moms reentering workforce  Overlooked demographic.
Oh boy! Free stuff!
Hillary had her idea out awhile back& is twice as long time than DT's'he has no leave in any of his businesses I've heard.
Policy no policy when it doesn't benefit people who need credits.
@GeorgWebb -This is awesome. Wished is was around when my kids were small.
Show us your tax returns!
$4.4 TRILLION tax cut. Really! And what programs will be affected???
Donald is right!! We need to kill FORD Motors for moving jobs to Mexico! Embargo Ford! NEVER BUY A FORD AGAIN!!!


some think this is a new welfare program-  wends a message to everyday people  "We hear you"  Working families need a break
you lied on the Pastor. Your going back where you belong in HELL!!
... I can't wait until you change those flags behind you. And those stupid faces you make!?! What's up with that? Pathetic!
joke
Love the way UR eyes sparkle when you talk about your father. Don't see that sparkle in @ChelseaClinton eyes!
@IvankaTrump so u r unaware that the policy "proposal" is exclusive, does not include fathers, & is a huge step backwards?
Hillarys is better and offers time off to the father Trump the American Hitler
please respect Muslims and we will respect you please don't be racist
looks like your policy excludes men. I guess women do all the child raising in your world? Men work, women stay home?
tell us that joke again about lead poisoning the children of Flint.  That was a real hoot!
You are literally asking tax payers to subsidize the cost of a nanny for the rich-stay-at-home moms.
who is paying for this?
