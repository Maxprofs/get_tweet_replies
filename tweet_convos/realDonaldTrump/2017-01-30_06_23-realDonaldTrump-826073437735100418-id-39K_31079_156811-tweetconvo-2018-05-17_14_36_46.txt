You all realize neither China or Mexico are taking our jobs? Automation & tech is...
& that's a *good* thing... maybe @peterthiel can explain a thing or two to you about basic income
no one wants to work in a factory... why put ppl in there for no reason when tech can do it?
... put robots in there—give everyone a little guaranteed cash. get rid of unemployment perks
Ironically, the ppl who'd oppose are those who need the it the most. We want to help out
You all realize self-driving cars will replace millions of jobs within a few years?
I'm in tech—I have nothing to gain. Just warning you're being lied to. Manufacturing jobs aren't coming back
your so smart. We should have listened to you #leftest rhetoric from the get go
serious question. How do you feel about robots and automated manufacturing?
not that I'm aware of.
cosign; I've kept my ears open and not heard anything
That would involve pushing for better education, then he wouldn't have a clueless army of followers lol
did Obomber ever discuss it?or killer Clinton?or their robotic army of flunkies! lol #MAGA
Yep.
.@realDonaldTrump Don't you dare label the press the enemy the same week you make a religious ban. It makes you look scared and fascist.
.@realDonaldTrump Oh Donald it's all just so much worse than anyone could have expected. Steve is taking horrible advantage of you.
Obama did the same in 2011, where were yall then 
Sorry we're apparently more educated than you.  Find a credible news source
u should focus on making ur immediate surroundings better; let the adults handle it. see u in a few years when u have learned
.@realDonaldTrump Great job parroting President Bannon, puppet. <3
This dude's so fucking ugly he makes me want to vomit.
And his looks are actually his best quality.
He has a bad case of "alcoholic nose".
Yeah. Since Trump doesn't drink.. I am sure Bannon drinks enough for the both of them.
Mags had exactly this Betabitch woman wanting/hating cucked #DarthBannon in mind...
Please send these refugees to Canada instead of deporting them ! I will pay for their Plane ticket! @JustinTrudeau
if this is real that's awesome!
 #
I am 100% genuine and serious! My family has been there and I know what it feels to be in their shoes
that's awesome and very generous of you. Let's hope they allow some private sponsors
Remember, @realDonaldTrump ,the majority of voters didn't want u. U should seriously be doubting ur legitimacy right now.
@Dbargen  @realDonaldTrump Majority didnt want Trump Which part of voters the legal or voterfraud part #Maga #CCOT #Military
. @tellilikeitis @Dbargen @realDonaldTrump -you givevoff an air of notknowingness.
majority of states by far wanted new POTUS!u giveoff air of notagainness #ByeObomber
. @nocensord @tellilikeitis @Dbargen @realDonaldTrump - simple. Most AMERICANS did not vote for him. That's why he's having troubles.
. @Nickx000x @nocensord @tellilikeitis @Dbargen @realDonaldTrump - now we r back to the fact that the MAJORITY didn't vote for him.
. @Nickx000x @nocensord @tellilikeitis @Dbargen @realDonaldTrump - also, protesting is an American thing. #History
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! Did you have a lobotomy or are you Andy Kaufman?
you're rabid, foaming at the mouth, shitting all over the kitchen floor, eating it and repeating it...to the farm with you
I refuse to ever get used to the media being labeled the enemy. None of us should.
you work for fox? And you champion free press? "Fox objectivity" isn't that an oxymoron?
of course I am champian of free press & support fellow journos at @washingtonpost, @nytimes, @CNN, etc. Don't assume what I'm about
apologies if so. The words Murdoch and Fox don't have positive connotations
thank you! @realDonaldTrump's assault on the press and deliberate degradation of information is an American tragedy.
It manifest through policy to regulate business, support the poor, and incentivize job creation in America.  (1) @realDonaldTrump
You were part of the problem, exploiting loopholes for gain and sending manufacturing overseas. You cosigned the swamp. (2) @realDonaldTrump
he's putting office condos in the damn swamp, and selling cabinet positions to go with them! To boost his ego.
They were outraged, at Bush, who was losing 500K jobs/month. We elected @POTUS44 and he dug us out of the ditch.
Which is what we'll have to do again once President Bannon is done destroying this country.
We were / are outraged that all Trump / Ivanka brands sent jobs out of our country & still do. Will President Bannon fix? @realDonaldTrump
@POTUS ...outrage from Democrats and the opposition party (the media)...
But you repeat yourself there, Sir.

Yes, @CNN , the Clinton/Communist News Network @NolteNC @littlepeep09 @cnnwriter69 #FakeNews
@DebAlwaystrump
funny because the president-elect still hasn't been properly vetted. Taxes? Logan Act?
Just like Barrack Hussein Obama was vetted!Give me a break!Pres Trump MAGA
too bad birthers trumps mother and wife wouldn't have made the cut both illegal
Wrong again!Americans ok with legal immigrants!
Does that include Trump Shirts & Ties @realDonaldTrump?
I bet they're Still made there too
they are. At least the ones at our Macy's here. But Macy's is closing stores
I voted for you...I DID NOT VOTE FOR BANNON...Mr.PREZ. YOU MUST GET RID OF HIM. HE IS MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT
Call your elected representatives and tell them how you feel. They're the only ones that can stop Bannon.
Ahh "what aboutery": the last refuge of the scoundrel.
... 

Coincidentally a Russian propaganda technique as well:  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism …
Funny that.
Yeah! Where were all of you when American jobs were shipped to other count...oh. Right.
I have it on my calendar that we're outraged about refugees today. Can you double-check the schedule?
Fleeing our country to where? More jobs were lost to automation/tech. Also, Obama bailed out the US auto industry.
Where was all the outrage from @realDonaldTrump when he was making his suits in China and building with Chinese steel?
And BTW - this isn't about Democrat or liberal outrage...the whole world is shocked & appalled
I am confused now... So the DEMOCRATS are not the opposition party and BREITBART are not part of the media?
My new favorite thing! Hey @realDonaldTrump: how's it feel 2 be a @stephenkbannon puppet? Does Big #Putin get jealous? #ReasonsToProtest
Wow. Yup.
I'm not part of an opposition party @realDonaldTrump. But I will point out flawed processes, real effects and hypocrisy where I see it.
We had 48 months of straight economic growth under Obama. A record. Saved us from Republican $ crash; got out of Rep. Wars.
You're like some evil hybrid, part sadistic A-Hole and part whining imbecile RS
that was helpful. Thanks for contributing.
My pleasure RS
Jobs are for machines, who also happen to be the ones eliminating the vast majority of jobs. People need income, not jobs.
I think what trump may fail to grasp is the difference between a "job" & work.
Yeah.  I absolutely hate that, too.  The idea that nothing that isn't a job isn't work is very destructive.
work is what people naturally do for the wellbeing of their heart & soul, jobs are a completely different thing.
The outrage was coming from idiots like you and others pushing outrage issues like BIRTHERISM.
[S]
no entiendes que los nuestros construyen tu pais mientras los tuyos huevonean...
I'm really confused what jobs.America has full http://employment.best  tech industry and innovation. cosmopolitan country
says the hypocrite who made all his products in China. You're full of !!
Must be so scary for you. All those media outlets searching for tax records, Russian connections, embarrassing recordings.
You don't seem to realize that the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in almost 10 years.
.@realDonaldTrump you mean when our constitutional rights and civil liberties were still in tact?
Calling war on the media? Wow, you really are like Hitler. #ImpeachTrump
"Donald you are my best friend" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
Stop Trump! #Isis http://channeldraw.blogspot.it/2017/01/donald-you-are-my-best-friend-stop-trump.html …
It's not just "Democrats" who are opposing you now, it's humans in general. You're a pig.
Where were you instead of history class during the unit on the Geneva Convention?
Jobs migrating to Mexico isn't the same as a bogoted, anti-American policy that unfairly targets religious groups.
AMEN!
Actually, there was a plethora of NAFTA outrage coverage by media/"opposition party".
PLEASE. STOP. TWEETING.
downstairs.
there was outrage. Let's not forget it was @SenateMajLdr/@HouseGOP who refused to work for 6 of Obama's 8-yrs in office.
you can not rewrite history - you will be judged by your own crimes and short comings...
Jobs were never "fleeing" the country. Jobs weren't running away.
Jobs leaving the country does not violate our Constitution. Wake up and smell the resistance to your/Bannon's coup attempt
keep going President! Make our country safe, secure and take care of us! Thank you for not being all talk and no action!
Where's the support & recognition when Obama created 11.3 Million Jobs. Can you say hypocritical?
Oh wait, while Obama was creating jobs you were on a factless racist campaign to challenge his citizenship.
where are all of your products made? How many jobs are overseas making crappy trump brand garbage?
you are villian like J.I Joe movie I respect American country  whole world rspct American don't be bad work against Muslim
it fit their agenda of one world govt. so they didn't care, worked in Dem's favor.
- jobs didn't flee your country. Your country exploits foreign workers.
economy is dynamic and changing. You have to help country adapt to these changes and not blame other countries. Positive.
Lead by example ..bring your company back
so does that mean the @SteveBannon69 is the opposition as well? He owns a media Co. Or only media that you disagree with?
... Where are your ties made again ?
You helped with the jobs fleeing our country by having your and Ivanka's clothing Made in China!
REALLY? What cha gonna do bout this?

Sheila Y. Campbell Tel: 213-765-1049  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1spj7h8 
you and ivanka still send your jobs overseas
You were "Out sourcing" jobs in your company as well.
Where was all the outrage from Democrats and the opposition party (the media) when our jobs were fleeing our country?...
Yo! You can hold our heads underwater & be fought every step of the way. Or you can start reaching out. Unite or divide?
Gawd you know how to twist a fact.
since ur business is makin amazing buildings n so..take your talent to the middle East givem them something they never had!
What bad examples, they are bullies and despicable people.  They should be fired if they don't want towork
I'm sorry, we were trying to create programs to educate students and workers for the jobs in the 21 century economy.
where were you? Babysitting Kevin McCallister?
There was plenty of outrage agaisnt Bush.  I guess you couldn't hear in your guilded rooms. #liarinchief #whineylittlebitch
The only way you’ll ever get laid is if you crawl up a chicken’s ass and wait.
Can't something be done about the annoying "shuffling" noises in the background when the president talks?
Defund 50% of the UN payments for a period of 2 years, or more.  Kick them out of NYC.  They are useless and use OUR money.
Tell Ivanka to stop selling goods made overseas!

...They didn't care. they thought Obama care would take care of rhem..The laugh was on them.
Said the KING OF MADE IN CHINA
WRONG!
you have 4-5 more weeks to come through with my paid maternity leave. Seriously I'm about to pop
CEOs like you who exported the jobs because foreigner workers were cheaper probably paid them off.
ah ah, so sensitive to criticism. Grow up :3
would that include YOUR overseas manufacturing? #hypocrite
. These dem's will step over a dollar, to get to a dime. I hope their all gonna be investigated.
@POTUS come on donny boy even you don't manufacture your shut in the US cherry picking your ethics
#PersianGulf
too late you were born here but is a good argument for birth control
having trouble with the republicans blocking everything they were trying to do...kind of like what you are going thru now.
Most were outraged at you outsourcing your clothing and home goods lines to Mexico, China, & Bangladesh!
There was no outrage cause those immature enough to flip out had an excuse to not work. Nothing better to them.
oh you mean under Obama when unemployment went down? Yeah that was awful.
.@realDonaldTrump Media reported companies and (Republican) business owners were moving factories/jobs overseas. Oh, I forgot you don't read
Right on Mr President
@potus Why do you pretend to care? Oh, wait, did you suddenly move all of YOUR manufacturing back to the USA? Hypocrite.
Where were you? That's right buying illegal steel from China! Hyprocrite!
you have a <5% unemployment rate.
they were being obstructed by Republican congress
n now you can have slave wages in the US too. Yay!!!
Getting someone to pad their pockets.
What do you think the unions were screaming about? Republicans keep voting jobs away with "free trade". GOP LIE.
Not only will the repeal of the Affordable Care Act throw 20 million off insurance. It will also cost 1.2 million jobs.
Like the 2,000+ @GM @realDonaldTrump that left under your watch?
they were working
...you should know that a few miles SW of the WH, there is a govt run Corp that, ALL THEY DO is offload jobs overseas.
right, like when you sent all of your mfg jobs overseas. Where were your complaints then?
where was your outrage when you sent you clothing manufacturing to the Far East?  Hypocrite!
They completely lost it,they were busy marketing gay rights to the whole world.
@POTUS , get the immigrants off of Medicaid and let them pay into the system first then let them get Medicaid and SSI
They're all globalists. Beware of some in GOP also. They want to strip away our sovereignty.
Globalisation is an unstoppable force, be careful about trying to retard it. Consider free high quality education.
I was hoping for a battle of wits but you appear to be unarmed.
seriously?
yes the SILICON VALLEY is losing many jobs to out of the country Visas...People and kids are leaving the area due to this
Mr. President you are excellent---you are the positive & they are the negative.
The upset of the decade.  Hillary Clinton are u kidding me.  Both sides crushed and crying like babies. Set new precidence
Overseas jobs that you helped create by licensing your name to companies there?
When do you plan to return your business production to the US? There are numerous AMERICAN FIRMS ready for the work!
need to get congress to pass the tax cuts
you mean like this?
Jobs were never "fleeing" the country! They were outsourced to protect our workers from parasites like yourself!
u r burning bridges.  Diplomacy would have helped ALL your causes. Stop being a bull in a China shop.
the jobs at your own companies?
Mr. President, I hope you invite HOWARD STERN to the White House one day. You have always been a good guest on his show.
like you and Ivanka business
@mdjtraveler What IF we all took a nice week vacation in the middle of Feb? Would we have it sorted out? Should  able #IPY
Make it so I can apply my religious beliefs to my business, pleeeeeese!
You must have been touring your Chinese factories instead of listening to it. Hm.
where are your god awful ties and shirts produced again? 
Stop blaming Democrats, it's the corporate leadership who decides where jobs go, took advantage of NAFTA the same way u do
AMEN
How true!   Outrage for all the neglect the Obama administration did.  No wonder we are in a mess!!!!!
This is not a campaign, no finger pointing. There is a solution; people give when we have a chance to receive $$. #solution
.@realDonaldTrump
Rather than work with @realDonaldTrump and maintain the appearance of influence, the DP prove their irrelevance as they lose every dispute.
Like all of the jobs in Trump Co that you sent overseas? All of your products that are manufactured in China? Hmm?
and you made your brand clothes in low-wage China.
MR. PRESIDENT YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB!!!  WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR OPPOSITION, "YOU CAN NOT FIX STUPID"!!!
That's a really good question.
all paid outrage there must be an investigation into George Soros
pendejo
take a look @msha if you want to help small bus. Out of control inspections
why are your businesses still in China?
I know I know getting rich through the Clinton Foundation don't you know
same place it was when you were fleeing the draft!
THEY TOO BUSY FIGHTING PRIVILEGE HULK! THEY GONE, PRIVILEGE STILL HERE! WHO LAUGHING NOW?!
I like the things you say. NAFTA and GAT were abominations to our country. And Republicans and Democrats both aproved
you're a hypocrite plain and simple
Same as they are now just under a different party and a different person 
no kidding!!! Clean house. Career Politics has to come to an END. End the corruption!!!!
U tweet EVERY DAY 0 Response From u  NOT GOOD. anti-media??  It's about us?????
Have you compared your numbers in all aspects to Obama's. You need to reconsider what it means to represent all Americans
Because those businesses are not purely American. It's called going international.

I would love to protest against the dems but I have a job. liberals, work more less talk! Full steam ahead Mr. President
we were outraged when Bush fu*ked up the economy,where were u?
Where was all the outrage from Republicans? The media correctly reported the news of companies leaving.
