You had nothing to do with the success of the Olympics. That credit goes to President Moon. It would have been great even if NK didn't attend. But a team and their dignitaries did attend and your VP snubbed them.
His VP is a complete joke! He calls himself a Christian! Pence is as bad as Trump is only in different way. Hopefully when Mueller is finished with the investigation this man will be impeached to! They are both double in trouble! 
Agreed. And he's complicit in everything trump did and is still doing.
The guy never smiles! 
Except when he looks at dotard Donnie, with that look of love on his face.
So funny!
It's funny all the things they said Trump done and all you've got is he's mean and he don't smile and he's stupid and I don't like him and though in calling people names you are the perfect liberal.

Donald Trump said something nice. The world is ending
When Kevin? I must of missed something. Hmmm
He congratulated our Olympians!! Rare. I know
Nothing was nice about it. He said it was hard to watch them. That's a slap in the face not just to the disabled but to every severely injured vet that's worked hard to recover their sacrifices to our nation. .
He is probably the most unapologetic person in the whole world! He will not apologize for anything he has done! I don’t think he knows what the word means. 

You must be a homophobic racist.  You don't think black people can think and express their own thoughts.

You mean DJT is not mimicking them like he did the disabled reporter on his meddling campaign
That was addressed in the Comey memos.  He didn't make fun of that reporter.  Are you capable of looking stuff up or are you just a parrot that repeats what it hears?
So you believe the Comey memos now. Good; we're making progress.
Yes I believe his memos.  They proved he wasn't being forced by Trump to do anything.  They also proved Comey leaked information.
Good, then you also believe Trump did tell Comey he did not stay overnight in Moscow in 2013.

@realDonaldTrump - YOU SAID “it’s hard to watch too much but I watched as much as I could.”  May you shatter your C3 and C4 and spend what’s left of your life clock as a non-verbal quadriplegic.
Wow, thats a very white group. I'll wager a bet there wasn't one gay person there either.

We love YOU President Trump and THANK YOU for making America GREAT again!!!!! I'm buying one of your hats. I think your AMAZING and oh how you have battled FOR US!!!
Unless you're disabled, or black, or a woman but yes let's go with 'all of us'
No way you wrote this.
Did you honor any tennis players today? 

@realDonaldTrump doesn’t deserve the honor or respect of these great athletes, good call  
Mr Trump. It has reached a stage where people(who think) automatically believe the opposite of what you say. You congratulate Paralympians? Didn’t you very publicly mock a disabled reporter? We know your true values. You are a sham, entirely.

I'm sure the Paralympians remember how you mocked a reporter with disabilities.
"It was difficult to watch" that's how the majority of us feel about your presidency. You lack of empathy for people with special needs is disgusting;then again everything about you is disgusting. #IMPOTUS
The sight and sound of Trump creates a physical revulsion in me; tough to watch is an understatement. He’s devoid of empathy or humanity and truly is #IMPOTUS .Trump is intolerant of diversity in any form.
REALLY?????

As though participating in the capitalistic exercise of buy low/sell high is somehow an unacceptable practice in America??? The premise you spout, if true, only clearly shows Sean's investment savvy. Sean Hannity is not personally responsible for people losing their homes.

He's gorgeous!!
mr president how can we make good honest peace as our usa were we as a country and a world can work together to make peace as real peacemakers and patriots to the peace we all can learn about and share the great education of peace that we can make any where in life
So once again 45 embarrasses himself with callous and crude comments.  What a bigot!

Trump couldn’t even get a participation trophy in the buy your wife a birthday present event
But it was hard to watch those disabled ones, yes?
The paralympians trump found hard to watch?
U think it was tough to watch the Paralympics eh Donald? THIS was tough to watch.
They don't like you either!
Yet you thought it was ok to do this...
Are you also congratulating all of the Olympians who refused to tarnish their medals and refused to be seen with you at the @WhiteHouse?
“... it’s a little tough to watch ...” -a sad little man
Where's the part where you say Paralympians competing is "a little hard to watch"?

The world thinks you are hard to watch. Excruciating.



Funny how a great deal of the Olympians do Not want to meet you.

You had trouble watching them?  We have trouble watching you.
Nice job insulting the Paralympic athletes by telling them they are tough to watch. You are tough to watch all the time.
Trump today - "What happened with the Paralympics was so incredible & so inspiring to me. And I watched - it's a little tough to watch too much, but I watched as much as I could."  

Why is it tough to watch the disabled - you don't even know when you insult somebody anymore. SAD
I find YOU difficult to watch AND listen to ALL the time. Your mouth is disabled.
Too bad those amazing/courageous athletes were so tough for you to watch. Your bigotry is limitless.
Don’t pretend for one minute that you really care about these amazing individuals and their achievements. They certainly have more stamina than you will ever have!
This is hard to watch
Even though you said you can’t bear to watch too much of it....?
Yeah, it’s awesome! Too bad the president disrespected all the Paralympians.
The way @potus cringed and said “it was tough to watch” made the world blush that a US President could be so insensitive to these brave athletes who have risen above loss of limb to show strength and determination through competitive sport. @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace!

You, @potus, need to get a clue about showing respect to persons w/ physical challenges - news reporter & now paralympics. They are heroes. But you mock persons transcending physical impairment, & find them "tough" to watch. YOU are pathetic excuse for presid. Vote Dem #resist
@potus, when @Whitehouse & @PressSec filter your releases, they come-off much better. Did you know that big parts of America find it embarassing listening to you trying to put a sentence together, & cringe watching you deal w/ foreign dignitaries. Read a book or something #resist
Hard to watch them?
Even though he could barely watch?? #WORSTpresidentEVER
He only respects “perfection” even when nipped,tucked, pulled and full of silicone
It was lovely to see the President of the United States greet the Olympians so personally, and allow so many of them to come up to the podium and speak.  What a beautiful, meaningful and once in a lifetime experience for them!  President Trump, you are simply wonderful!


You’re not an American if you attended this ceremony. You’re enabling a Russian-installed fraud and criminal, while you take selfies and act like this man isn’t causing mass suffering in your country.
They are very much Americans but willfully complicit and enabling the suffering of other Americans along with the destruction of our environment. Some people just don’t care as long as they get what they want.


You literally said "paralympians are tough to watch," you ableist POS. I would say I can't believe people support this level of bigotry and hate but then there's this:
Even the no shows?
I'm Korean. Please help North Korea and South Korea unify. If South and North Korea unify, Trump, you are a great man.
@DonnaWR8 you never answered me on why you support Trump and what country you live in. Still waiting for a response
Trump esta' tratando de que el mundo se una sin terrorismo
Can you say the rest of what he said, like it's hard to watch these handicapped folks
Your comment that the Paralympics were “tough to watch” is one of the most vile and disgusting things I have ever heard. I hope @TeamUSA will call you out for your horrible disrespect. American paralympians are examples of America at its finest; you, at its worst.
Go on...

Tell us what you really think off-script.  Oh, you will? Lovely!

Glad loser Lindsey Vonn wasn't there, we didn't need  her to win a gold medal (good thing) to represent the True American Patriots.

“It’s a little tough to watch too much, but I watched as much as I could.” This is the same man that mocked a disabled reporter. Trump, you are the lowest form of human life and the country is ashamed of you.

Why does the president have discomfort watching the Paralympic events? Disgraceful.
And further more my grandfather was deported when he came over to America he wanted to be an American so bad he learned English started a business got his citizenship. And worked very hard for this country he was proud to have the opportunity to come backand become An American
