Sure it is...
Giving gifts to select companies is just more of the same cronyism we've seen.
US companies will now threaten to leave unless they get the "Carrier deal"
lowering taxes to the tune of 7 million to be passed on to IN taxpayers.
.@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @SteveDoocy @mike_pence did you answer how the other 1,000 jobs are actually going to Mexico?
300 jobs that weren't at risk of being shipped to #mexico @Carrier ?
ha ha
So they are referencing the auto bailout that Bush started during his term in '08. Wow, White House is getting pretty unhinged!
@TeamTrump @foxandfriends @SteveDoocy @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
1,000 jobs saved probably touches about 4,000 lives!!!!
So true: entire families are affected etc!
do it 800 more times to match Obama
misleading left-wing graph full of part-time jobs at CVS and Walmart. Trump just saved real jobs
Misleading # of jobs. @Carrier confirmed 300 jobs weren't even at risk of being shipped to #mexico. #TrumpLies
G-d Bless. Over the top happy about all these jobs. #Hope #Opportunity
not religious here..but why would you be afraid to say God? Curious
Respect, not fear. They don't write His Name, even references like G-d
respect would be not oppressing a belief
I don't know what oppression you are referencing. It's respect for their deity, not people. They don't tell others how to write it.
if that happened Ina relationship.. they'd call it "toxic"..just a comparison..u don't need to tear that up
I still don't know why you appear to be upset with me. I detest PC speech: forces one to always consider "race," gender, .... Evil.
This is a fake.
Hope U sent a great gift to your Insurgents down at the FBIsis.
#Resist
MOre lies, Most of the jobs are still moving to Mexico.
I'm glad we now have people that will stand behind their promise
Hey STUPID check this out...
A deal with The Red Racist is a deal with the Devil...Count your fingers

WOW!!!!!1
Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.7 million to Clinton
More layoffs planned at Carrier plant Trump promised to save http://fxn.ws/2zv4eJd  #FoxNews
Except the deal was a promo stunt/scam. It's cool. That's your career.

 Merkel's Germany, Berlin Subway: Afghans gang kicked a woman without reason in the back, she falls 8 steps with her face on concrete. 
oh god, isn't this old shit and it was no 1400 jobs, more like 700.
Went from 800 to 1400, lol
GVP
Storing TicTacs for the winter I see! #PutinPuppet

How does he even know if his job is saved? 1100 to Mexico
Except 500 of those jobs were never leaving.  Stop lying Trump! Terrible
It's just amazing that nobody ever, in the history of the universe, figured out how to be this awesome before.

How much did it cost to save 1000 jobs and lose 2000? Trump bad.
Trump is a putz who gave away the farm for a photo op. Set dangerous precedent.

So glad to see these workers are going to have a Christmas&better life.
Doesn't Trump's have investments in this company?
Pls talk to this gulag about Ivanka's offshore manufacturing. When will he be offering her a deal to bring it home?
Does this guy realize that it cost 7mil$ in taxpayer money?
Another campaign promise broken.  35% Tariff on products? Not pay to stay
we are agreed to make great America and great peaceful world
Not totally True about  Carrier it was a bad deal Trump made
how much did you pay him
No thank you, I do not drink absolute FOOL-AID.
There are no great interviews on Fox & Friends.
..So half of them are getting fired and the corp gets 7mil ..this is a win?
Just throw us a bone.  1000 out of 40000.  Gee thanks.
Carrier has over 40000 employees and 1000 is all u got?
Bullshit!
Bullshit 1000 jobs out of how many employees?
He's a fucking buffoon....Give me a break

MORE PEOPLE WANTED DJT AND MIKE PENCE  so leave it alone! We left it
singing a different tune! DO YOUR RESEARCH before you continue the HATE!
alone! Because if you really knew Obama's agenda you would probably be
that legacy is? If not? I suggest you go do your research! And leave DJT
that he is continuing on his daddy's legacy, and do you even know what
care how that effects Americans, he wants to prove something to his dad
just accusations! Obama only wants to protect the illegals and Doesn't
Obama ever has for the American people and it is a fact and shows not

Good news. Nice that a man that is tenured with 24 years keeps his job
Try again with the truth...
Donald J Trump is a man of his word & he's a man of action & a great negotiator!
with the tax cuts promised to keep the jobs, taxpayers are paying salary

OUTSTANDING job POTUS 2B my family is very appreciative. Merry Christmas
how about taking their government contracts instead of giving them $$$$$

They are still sending jobs to Mexico.
Millions of Americans have just been sucker-punched. They just don’t know it yet.
1300 will be laid off. 800 saved, the cost of 7 million to the taxpayers
<<meant for those with an IQ of room temperature. Murdoch's pets, part of #trumpswamp
The number of jobs being saved is 800 out of a total of 2,100. Some win.
7 million dollar tax break & hundreds of jobs still being moved to Mexico
all the people in the state are paying for those 1000 families to stay
This is the biggest load of crap. False reporting at its best.
Yo Donnie be careful how much you give.
Oh, but they are.  LIAR!

Have a Good One.
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
what about the 1300 jobs that are still going to Mex or In taxpayers?
Trump says "I could care less about people/lives I have $ in  pipeline"
Poor & middle class pay higher taxes so big corps can pay less. Good job
A great interview to T rump treats him like a god - Chou Wang seems best
you all are loosers
The 64 Million won't fall for the PR con. Better concede Donny
OH AND BTW Danny Boy... A Wife CAN be raped!!!! Got that now???
. Dis you mention the 1300 jobs that Carrier is still moving to Mexico
http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/world/carrier-trump-deal-tax-incentives-1.3879089 …
@realDonal@mike_pence that 1000 jobs saved as a drop in the bucket what Obama did with General Motors
Thank You you,You are a true leader Trump...

I thought the media was untrustworthy. You said so. LIARS!
A majority of those employees are still getting laid-off.
Businessman are laughing about this deal. DT did nothing.
my God a monkey could have sold out the people of Indiana
you guys got screwed. The Indiana Taxpayers foot the entire bill.
Fox News only lies for Trump
I thought you were going to drain the swamp????
Make American great again
http://thehill.com/homenews/news/308575-palin-slams-crony-capitalism-after-trump-seals-carrier-deal …
How come when @HillaryClinton & @BarackObama speak they only say "I"  & @realDonaldTrump says "WE"? It's #WeThePeople right?
Fox leaves out info that > 1,000 Carrier jobs will be outsourced. And no taxes for Carrier.
too bad 1300 are still screwed
Actually only 400 jobs, that hadn't already been saved by other means.
interesting 1300 jobs leaving the US, Carrier getting $7mil and you own stock.
Carrier is still sending 1000s of jobs overseas.
no where near as many jobs as Obama saved!!
