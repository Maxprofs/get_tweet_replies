If the election were today
But, the majority already did vote. And they voted for Hillary.
Sawey... that's not true. Don't forget the illegal votes. He probably WON by 3 million so.... too bad.
I suppose all republican votes were legit. I mean it’s completely cool to have a country change bankruptcy law to stop you from doing it and abuse women and civil rights but low and behold the GOP would never fix an election, pashaw! #whiteisright
Listen I'm not saying that Republicans are on the up and up either, but let's not pretend that the Democrats are the most crooked corrupt hypocrites that ever walked the planet. You're all bought and paid for by the media always have been,  always will be. I'm independent
#Resign
While #DonaldTrump rides around on his golf cart playing golf and entertaining, millions of Americans are in dire need without electricity in #PuertoRico. Unacceptable 
Should tell them to vote to become part of America and start paying taxes and then we can help them all they want.
They are an American territory so they do pay taxes unlike Spanky.
They don’t pay federal personal income tax.
What, no chocolate cake?!

Love to join you there ...maybe someday.
@realDonaldTrump, dude, you should just do your best to disappear. Seriously, this just gets more embarrassing for you every day. The manic mechanic tweets, the trying trying to wrap our flag around Russia. It’s just not going to pan out and you know that now, time to resign.
How was the ?? 
Yeah, heard he is a great business man 
America Loves you Donald!  Keep up the great work!
What was accomplished? You're always saying "success"... right now that's just one of your running lies.
It was your honor to play golf again. You worry about your campaign promises and one of those was you wouldn’t be able to play golf because you will be busy working. You have played more gold than any other President! You have only been in office a little over a year. SAD!
Yes I’m sure there was lots accomplished golf eating golf eating more golf


Uhh, that is McConnel, Schumer, Pelosi and Ryan.  You have the wrong guy.  But they are not only draining the Treasury, they are also draining our tax money, yes you and me on thier pay for play schemes with big pharma and big banks.
So good that he can get that Mar-a-Lago mention in there #makingmoneywhilerunningthecountry
Cool. Release your taxes.
Waisting millions of dollars paid by working Americans going straight to you a non paying tax corrupt criminal
This clip looks like a promo video for Mar-a-lago really doesn't it? I think you should have a word with the owner because they are getting free publicity as a result
日米首脳会談最高です！米朝首脳会談は、日本の米軍基地でされたらどうでしょうか？とにかく、一日も早く暴力団関係者や右翼団体や左翼ゲリラを米軍の空母で壊滅して下さい。
Cool story bro
Sorry Mr. Abe for anything stupid he may have said!
Trump rally everyone!!!
Wow gives me goose bumps... he is making America great again wooohooooo
Lotsa accomplished - a lot of money made by yours truly. Who needs a salary when you’re making money every time I show up at one of my properties 
Keep making the big bucks for yourself at your tacky arse "resort".
You have no friends and you went there to golf don’t bullshit

NEWS: A wide-array of Republicans won’t say they’ll back Trump for re-election in 2020, ranging from lawmakers in leadership to the rank-and-file. Some don’t know if he’ll run, others want to avoid topic at all costs. Many say it’s far too early. My story: https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/politics/congress-republicans-trump-second-term/index.html …
Arso Donald Chump, the Rising Sun say you are Stupid Buddy Plick!
Making more money off the American People aren’t you Donnie? The more golfing, meetings, and affairs you hold at Mar Lago the more $$$ you make!  The fleecing of America!
That’s good! #Nippon #Japan

President Trump! The Lord is your Fortress. Your enemies are the Enemies of the Kingdom of God. Continue to continue fight with the boldness as you have been fighting. 
Psa 18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust.
How can you speak out and human rights abuse in Syria in Cuba and Venezuela. But remain silence on police abuse and Killing of African-Americans at home.
I’m tired of hearing about police brutality, black lives, white power, and Stormy Daniels! None of it matters if we can’t keep our great nation united. We will all be destroyed if we can’t come together again. ALL LIVES MATTER!
You sir are an idiot! You know nothing of American people! I absolutely support OUR president! I wasn’t taught to riot and destroy my home town. I was taught RESPECT! Something you have none of!
My family been in this country for 500 years. You know nothing about African people.

You got money to celibret with people from other country !! You got money to pay back social security and pay seniors a livable wage
Comb Over Donny, Heard you spent 149 days of your 1st 457 days in office at Mar-a-Lago. & U complained about Obama's vaca's. You finally beat him at something. Big cost to taxpayers, but this must be the way you fill the swamp. What happened to "drain the sump? another Trump lie
And you made a bunch of money on him being there.  What a crook #ResignNow
Nice job 1st. Lady
YOU know what's not a success? YOU didn't help our Puerto Rico! Puerto Ricans are Americans! When are you going to help & fix Puerto Rico?
$100+million on golf at his own properties (which means WE are paying him to golf) WORST PRESIDENT EVER...
Trump 2020
What an elegant dinner.  So nice President Trump has away of letting people know he appreciates them.
That's what our White House is for. We're paying for all this, as you put it, elegance. Our money is no object to trump.
This dinner for a foreign diplomat.  He doesn’t take a salary and holds the dinner at his own place.  Also our President Trump has to negotiate where there won’t be leaks. Would you suggest McDonalds ?Obama had celebrity bashes tax payer funded
The taxpayers pay for all flights, dinners, pageantry, Abe's accommodations and everything else involved. He's made so much personal cash off being president. He isn't taking a salary just for show so his trumpskulls will post things like you just did.
Watch out your hate is showing.  So grateful God gave us this great leader our President Trump.
You shouldn't mock God

There would be no one left to enter the "stupid" Olympics.
Wow.   How have you not brought him up on ethics violations yet @GOP?   This is blatantly using his government position to enrich himself.

#TheResistance #ImpeachTrump
This is WRONG! The White House is the residence of the president and should be the place to receive foreign dignitaries. You do this to profit personally from the office, which is illegal and just plain wrong.
MAKE AMERICA GREEDY AGAIN. HOW MUCH PROFIT DID YOU MAKE FROM USING YOUR OFFICE TO PROMOTE YOUR PRIVATE BUSINESS. SHAME ON YOU!!!!!
We love you. Thanks buddy
Sir ........can i ask me..????
Hopefully there was no charge to the American tax payer for using a trump  golf place...
Wow. Promoting private business with the WH seal also?  Interesting ethics choice.
You will be impeached
#Corruption in progress
@realDonaldTrump This is what you are...
For the purposes of @OfficeGovEthics what would you estimate your profits  from this "visit" @POTUS? Taxpayers deserve to know as they're footing the bill for you and @Trump Inc. looting of the @USTreasury.
It was my great honor to host my friend @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo and his delegation at Mar-a-Lago for the past two days. Lots accomplished, thank you! #Success 
The people’s business should be done at the people’s house, not Trump’s house at our Expense! That’s why he was Elected to the White House! I guess the White House is not good enough for him! Besides he makes more money at his house!
It was not our honor to pay for it, especially since you are the collector of the monies.

Is this ad for his resort?
Well just seeing the pink buildings and over the top rooms I think they were designed by Barbara Cartland
This is an ad using government resources.
Bet you had a great deal in common? Neither of you are governing a democracy.
that's actually true Japan's a single party state for mosy the last 70 years america well can you say 'omnibus'
Very interesting that #Cohen has dropped his suit against Buzzfeed. He must know how much they know about him and his ‘shenanigans’ upon your behalf. #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
He is an Iraqi and I tell you that you are a war criminal
Did explain how you line your pocket with the money of the American taxpayer by going to Mar-a-lago when the @WhiteHouse is just sitting there. #ImpeachTrump #showyourTaxes.
Trump is PROFITING off his bullshit   " Southern White House". This is a crime.

Try not to make any racist comments while you in the meeting. Let him get out of the country first! And try cut down on the lies while you're at it. I know I'm asking too much, but try.
I see Mar-A-Lago is as overly gold as your home. You just can't see when it crosses the line to trashy do you?
No one is your friend.
Netanyahu might disagree

He thinks you’re a moron.
Your friend?

It looks like you just had a very Profitable Week!  Just what did it cost us?

What was wrong with the hosting in the White House oh that’s right you think it’s a dump

How much of our tax money was spent hosting the Prime Minister at your property? I'm tired of wasting tax dollars propping up your (probably) failing businesses while you violate our Constitution.

Now YOU do YOUR job. Pass the ENTIRE #MARCHFOROURLIVES AGENDA, then move on to other important items.
Nothing but collusion and conspiracy. Hey Trump, maybe you and Cohen will have adjoining  jail cells
And it has been our pleasure as tax payers to pay for your trip there so you could make even more money hosting him and his clan. 

Indeed. See this:

The least he could have done is spread the wealth if he says it's doing good but no you got to have all this money going to his own property in pocket taxpayers pay me for me to be living on my property
Nothing is more disturbing to see @realDonaldTrump continue to fill his greedy & criminal wallet on the taxpayers dime. 

And your 5x "No Collusion" comments.....FYI #MuellerTime investigation isn't complete Spanky!
Thank you, President Trump for your great and honorable service to our Country. Who's going to be your running mate in 2020? Looking forward to hear the news. #Trump2020
He don't like you !!!
The Japanese people think you are a clown, which means that they have something in common with most of the Americans. As do most of the people in the rest of the civilized world. You are the most embarrassing American that I can remember in my life, head & shoulders above Jr even

You hosted him in an elegant way. Proud of your American hospitality.
Can you define 'lots accomplished?' Especially that big word, someone else must have written this cause I doubt your vocabulary extends that far
Another plug for your tasteless shithole. Puerto Rico has no power. Flint has no drinkable water.  Taxpayers watch you golf and kiss ass.  Camp David and the WH are available.   First thought when I heard you were meeting UN was good. Maybe he will shoot you.
Great video. Thank you President Trump, you are the great President.

Nicely done there at your little seaside cottage! J/K
