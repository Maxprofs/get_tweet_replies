And just who's pocket ya think the money comes from? We pay to feed them, house them, and their free health ins.
You bought a win. Some keep their jobs not all, funded by state and federal taxes. Only because Pence is governor.
If you don't keep your campaign promises, ALL OF THEM, "We the People" will remember, and you will lose everything.
Way to go!!!
Plants have 2100 employees

@S3nt13ntB31ng @No_Idteaots @Paul197 
Well, we gave him a chance but then he started picking his KKKabinet.
No thanks.

in other words, you are racist of skin tone matters to you
Please pick Romney. He is knowledgeable and smart
and he walks like a penguin.
I like that!
is going to use social media to boast about his accomplishments & trash everyone who is against him for the next 4 years.
Obama has controlled the media for 8 years. We have only heard what he wanted us to hear. Time for some truth.
Wow Bill. Tin foil hat time.

What he's not telling you is 2,000 jobs are going to Mexico & WE are paying Carrier to stay. Taxpayer bailout.
Remember when he said he'd make THEM pay? Remember when Clinton told you YOU would pay? Here it is Trumpers. Get ready.
contact Robert Steele if you want to know which people you have around you are traitors! Get rid of Priebis and Ryan ASAP!
@julezmac
Pence used taxpayer money to pay the company to stay. Gov bailouts aren't what T promised. Read more
Over the next 10 years and the payback of keeping those folks employed is Great for USA

I'm sure people of the Great State of Indiana appreciate paying the salaries of  1,100 fellow Hoosiers 4 10 yrs.
You are not helping the working class if you cut Social Security and Medicare. Do NOT cut and privatize these programs.
Why are your hands a different colour than your face?

AMERICA does not understand the depth and breath of the Love Pres. ELECTTrump Has for this country! A true PATRIOT,
Thank you Trump!!!
If you really supported the working class, you'd have no problem raising the minimum wage & hiring legal American workers!

Sir, would you help a Vet who is having 40% of his retirement taken by the Government under VSI recoupment?
bullshit
lying bunch of BS
sir,can't do you help for my study to university, I don't for studying, because I don't have many for him.
no more corporate welfare. They are a very profitable company. Take away their govt contracts if they take factory offshore
working class??  LMAO - you mean you and your billionaire buddies!  Give me a break!  I don't buy your shit!
- Mr Pres, PLEASE, don't do away w/ the Mort Int deduction. This is 1 of the greatest allures to homeownership. Hands off!
LOL can't wait til the working class sees how bad you conned them. Then we will be the United States of f* you
@organic2016 We are so grateful. You give us hope. Thank you.
You give massive tax break so some workers stay here, you pat yourself on the back,& unwitting crowd goes wild!
You can recoup money by cutting people's insurance, vouchers for vets, and retirees. What a 'great' businessman you are?
Coincidence yo u"helped" Pence's home state?  Help a blue state!
Such bullshit.
What kind of deal did you make with Carrier? What price do Indiana taxpayers have to pay? We'll decide if good or bad.
Do...what?

Because unlike Trump I have a social life and travel and don't spend time usually replying to fools...
What do you think you are doing right now?
Are you a fool?
No, a Trumpian!
same thing.
not the 1300 whose jobs still went to Mexico. Not people on Medicare that you want to steal
The NY Post? Now, there's a quality newspaper! Also, there's something strange about being referred 2 in 3rd person
At whose expense?  Certainly not his!

At what cost to tax payers? $7M for 800 jobs? 2/3 still heading to Mex. No wonder Pence stayed on as Gov.
What tariff threat or tax bribe did you offer to get Ivanka Trump to bring her company's jobs back from China? #DumbDonald

The news here is not just what's in the headline... the McConnell plot is jaw-dropping http://goo.gl/WeKHUx 
Trump took 7million from working Americans in Indiana to bribe carrier to only move 1300 jobs to Mexico.  SEVEN MILLION
BS! You've filled the swamp with billionaires, white nationalists, and idiots!
15.6 million jobs created over past 81 months during Obama administration

@bencarson - Carson may head HUD. Pls keep mortgage interest tax right off. 1 of the best tax breaks 4 wrking/middle class.
You lost 1300 jobs to Mexico. Pres. Obama saved then entire US auto industry. Sad little bit of jobs. Try harder next time.
lol really by paying them taxpayers money to a $600 million profit company??? he pays no taxes..not fit to be president
At the expense of who? Wake-up people! Donald pulled off his biggest CON to date!
such a credible source .
Trump is the People's President! Awesome!
Sure.   Your Labor Secretary is virulently anti-labor.
does the working class taxpayers know they are footing the bill to keep less than 1000 jobs
Can't fool those 800+ Carrier jobs that still went to Mex. See, half truths don't work either. Can't bamboozle all of us..
Great hob. Exceeding expectations already. Obama is hating it..cry,cry.  Keep up the fabulous job!
