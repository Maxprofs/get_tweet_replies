Thank you Bush for contributing with your $1.7 trillion and counting unfunded never ending wars.
@TheFirstSmoke Reagan/Bush...started the debt, so what's the difference?
do you really think Donald Trump (or any president) is gonna change this?get real
Obama "saved America from financial ruin" by leaving it $10 TRILLION deeper in debt? Someone do that math for me..?

#MAGA
and keeping interest rates at 0% with 1.1% GDP, everything's fine.
Banksters pull trillions from a magical goose's ass in the sky to lend to us @ interest. We're perfectly fine.

@realDonaldTrump
if Trump wins, debt drops to $10Tril. Bring back $5T overseas, negotiate with JAP, CHN, domestic growth inc
I also think he can work with Ryan to balance the budget then cut a ton of waste and means test programs.
The fed govt is a gluttonous pig eating all the food in everyone's homes. It needs to be cut dramatically.

@realDonaldTrump
it's disgusting but Ryan is malleable, Trump will eat him for breakfast and Ryan will think he got somethin
From the GOPe's behavior, you'd think they all feared criminal prosecution under a @realDonaldTrump administration.
i feel like i follow you since so many people RT your stuff on my TL
Obama's greatest accomplishment!!!!
Well you could always declare bankruptcy. I know at least YOU would...
If our nation's wealth is not distributed evenly, why should the debt? Shouldn't 1% own 90% of that 19.4T?
It took you 2 hours to realize you should have expressed sympathy before promoting yourself?
@realDonaldTrump
in the words of preisdent obama"its unpatrioitc its irresponsible lol then he doubles it  the lier in chief
I love this tweet because it is the normal @GOP line which somehow ignores the recession that THEY FUCKING CAUSED
@realDonaldTrump
#MAGA please!
We knew it was going to be nearly doubled by the time Traveling & Vacationing Obama was finished!  Using that jet all over!
Where are your Tax Returns?
why do we need to see his tax returns? How would that help anything.  Let's see all the investigations on HRC
It's called 'Transparency' What's #Trump is hiding?
#DonTheCon
#NeverTrump
too bad the Iraq war you supported is responsible for a lot of that
the debt is multiplying because we are fighting wars started by Cheney over non existent WMDs.
thanks Obama and Bush and Clinton for free trading all our jobs away!  Vote Trump/Pence!
*****VOTE TRUMP*****
National debt under Bush: 2000- 5.63 Trillion; 2008- 10 trillion. He doubled it just like Obama did, but w/no meltdown.
Because people like u r making $ n NOT paying any taxes, that's what I hear, many many people are saying it, I know it true
The Dems love to spend to keep people under their control!
Obama is very WEAK on the National Debt. Didn't even double it. I will TRIPLE the Debt. Believe me! @realDonaldTrump
Dopey #RussianPaidEgg @Dwtjr2, why would I vote for him? He wants to Make Russia Great Again. I hate to tell you!
Lyin'@Dwtjr2 why do u think it's either or? You're an egg AND a moron. Putin ties are well established. Believe me!
what a stupid useless tweet. What are you 5 years old?
and the deficit will only get WORSE with Hillary rule.
Of course, Obama is trying to maintain the illusion of economic prosperity by over-spending—it's unsustainable.
do you think Obama knows Hillary may be indicted, but wants to drag it past the election so her VP can be president?
The answer should be duh. They will do anything to win.
@DownfallofWest This is the true meaning of Downfall of the West. An ever increasing debt load!
@fightnowamerica oh my goodness. Obama sent it to middle east and traveling
your debt = $1 billion+
stop running
He will never stop running nor should he. Donald Trump will help make this country even better than it already is
lol
So which part are you laughing at, that I am an honorably discharged vetetan, a cancer patient, or????

excuse me do u know me? I do selfless work I bet u couldn't do/ wouldnt even last doing the work i do.

disclose how much went to #Isreal under different names & including under cover if pentagon expense
: you added to deficit when you filed for bankruptcy 6 times. Release your tax returns.
the revamping of ACA is scheduled to add 3 billion to national debt alone.
we know nothing yet. But we do know Obama added a lot more than that w nothing to show for it
When will they learn? Go Trump!
libs love poverty though. That's just more votes.
Republicans are the ones who cuts funding for poor, disabled, vets, elderly. #Criminal #Greedy @shawgerald4 @realDonaldTrump
you use words like criminal and greedy with Clinton as your candidate. Now that's funny.
u cannot even manage u'r own Co debt&uu claim2std up2&refuse itBecause guess what they alone r the cause ofNat deficit
Cannot have a whole damn #Trump #cabal running Predudensy
Unfit man #68 makes him unfit
what's ur culture?
Burgers, grills, freedom, no oppression, no terrorism, and truth.
Nothing Hillary provides.
yeah okay nice try...im waiting for him to answer.
Ah, alright. But really, America has always stood for freedom as it's core. Big Gvrmnt=/=not freedom
I see we couldn't somehow spend more money on a better graph.....
and YOUR debt?
how much is your debt and net worth?
Clintons & O has millions now. How does a "public servant" become millionaires while in office.
another uneducated trump voter lol! I feel sorry for you clowns!
Is that the best you can do.At least we didn't EAT THE BOOKS when we attended school
stop lying to your self man you didn't even go to school like I said God help u man
assume trump supporters=dumb. Do they have a right 2 vote for whoever they want? Y belittle them?
Probably looks like graphs for your bankruptcies!
HOW MUCH OF THIS $19.4 TRILLION IS BECAUSE MILLIONAIRES & BILLIONAIRES REFUSE TO PAY TAXES? & SEND THEIR MONEY OFF SHORE?
@realDonaldTrump
Right, because only terrorists are fleeing the war. Guess you haven't paid attention.
they could take "all" the woman and children less then 30% rest are grown men
Unfortunately, military aged men don't easily get refugee status.
Sure, they would have to be highly skilled professionals or scholars.
National debt would increase $11.5 trillion under Trump
And under HC? Debt, National Security, less jobs, open borders, and on and on and on...

@anti_globalist1 

Is reality 230 trillion? TNX
. @realDonaldTrump we can thank that shithead obama for that
Monkey business.
@realDonaldTrump
He refused to condemn the white supremacists who are campaigning for him
He did it after long?
you're a silly cunt though.
Ireland! STAY OUT OF OUR POLITICS. You elected to #Brexit Just like what we want to do!!!
no. I'm from Ireland. Britain voted to Brexit. Different countries. Like the way USA and Venezuela are different countries.
Is Ireland different to the US? Yes, so like he said, stay out of our politics you thick paddy.
I'm pointing out the difference between Ireland and the U.K. when she implied I voted for Brexit. Keep up, you fucking dildo.
When the 4000 unvetted rapefugees enter your country and start raping your women/kids you'll be singing a different tune

We Luv or PResident Doneld Truümp! Best of all time!

you at a Trump rally.
Obama the blank check President.
Trump. The fake university, multiple bankruptcy wanna be.
America needs a businessman @realDonaldTrump
Not a bad idea really. If you know of any good ones ask them to run in 2020.
Wars are expensive. You should give Bush and Cheney a good talkin' to #Trump! Wasting all of that good money.
Obamas hope & change that he promised cost the American taxpayers 10 trillion more.#WhatBullShit
Haha ! That's a good one. The "king of debt" is criticism our national debt.
iF that happens, it's a safe bet that trump will insist on being sworn in with his hand of "The art of the Deal"
How is the stock market doing?
you do realize the stock market is propped up with your taxes (if you even pay any)? Have you heard of QE?
You do realize Trump's so called net worth is propped up by his own "estimates" ?
forbes says 4.5 he says 10 cause he values his "brand". 4.5= hard assets. Who knows brand val
Look I get having Republican ideals but this guy is a con man.
When will HRC have a press conf!  What is she hiding from. Email questions maybe.? Flash more found! LIES
his taxes is not a legal issue lying under oath is. Get you priorities straight.
Sure is. Lying under oath not only is breaking the law but means she thinks we are stupid. Can't trust that.
We will see. Pt is. She has a long hist of this. Trump may have stuff but it wasn't while he was a gov employ
NEVERMIND.
What about those 60+ lawsuits against you for non-pay & low-pay to sub contractors @IBEW @HillaryClinton
I'm surprised that the national deficit wasn't mentioned in that post.
it cost money to fight over seas. Check out the facts.
Mr Trump  YOU ARE RIGHT ( CORRECT)ON ALL ACCOUNTS...
AS USUAL!
CONTINUE TO PREACH THE NEED TO VOTE NOVEMBER 8TH FOR CHANGE!
It's like maxing out a ton of credit cards and borrowing money from the kids to pay the minimum balances
Obama has done such a wonderful job over the past 8 years managing the national debt...NOT; and with no meaningful results.
@realDonaldTrump
- SIX years of GOP Congress and Senate voted for this!!
definite argument for expanding military, a $25b+ wall, big VA an deportation force and massive tax cut. #Stupid or lying?
Economists did the math. Trump's plan would cost 11 trillion of a decade putting debt at 127% GDP. Clinton's s wash. READ!
@EricTrump DONALD TRUMP THE NEXT USA PRESIDENT USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA
yeah keep voting democrat, your kids will not be able to go to college, own their own homes, Trump is the only way to go.
$650 Million of it YOU owe to China you PUTZ!} How much are you in with Putin!?

crybaby release your tax returns
debt is not even a campaign issue WHY NOT?
needs to be a serious issue to campaign on. Debt and entitlements to overtake tax revenues in 10 years. IMPORTANT

@MrEdTrain Obama doubled debt to $20T hurting most vulnerable-Srs, women & kids-with higher costs.
woe
Obama called bush unpatriotic and irresponsible for adding 4 trillion by his lonesome. Obama added 9 trillion  horrible
because because of wrong leadership
Cut waste/cut spending/privatize social security/sell oil/manufacture products to sell/end Fed Reserve/no foreign aid/no UN
@grace7847 hey hey hey!!  The Obama Admin had nothing to do with that.  If you don't believe me, ask them!  Sarcasm.
Its growing and is actually sign of strenght. You should know from personal experience. Hope y can payback yours US can:)

WATCH TRUMP ADD 10 TRILLION TO THAT DEBT REAL QUICK WHEN HE CUTS ESTATE/Luxury Tax for him and His 1% buddies!  #TrumpLies
It should decrease in times of peace, but not under Obama.
you do realize that a Republican controlled Congress did that????
it’s called leverage. I’m sure a big time winner/business man can understand that.
@realDonaldTrump

Funny thing: first #Dubya doubled the debt...then he left a big-ass mess for @POTUS to clean up

@realDonaldTrump
Do you have a plan to decrease student loan debt crisis? I came up with one, yours Trump, for the asking.
but, somehow the stock market continues to have confidence in the USA. It makes Trump wealth look like allowance.
.@realDonaldTrump are you saying the #KINGofDebt doesn't know how debt works and what feeds it? http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-king-of-debt-224642 … ~#WoW~

Trump debt =$800 million - cannot even manage his own finances! Incompetent, insane, insolvent
