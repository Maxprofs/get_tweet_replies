The only group that benefits your plan are the rich and the corporations.

The White House is where the American dream finally went to die! SAD!
First, the American dream was captured by Russia. Then, it was tortured relentlessly. Now, it may die.
Dear Dave, I do not mean to be abrasive, but if you were able to conceive of a proper thought, you would know how absurd your statement is!
Yes, they are all traitors!
Really, Damien? You think that Hillary is a traitor?
The tax rate on the poorest of Americans is going up from 10% to 12%. In what alternate reality does that make sense? You 're robbing from the poor to give to the rich?
And it barely recovers pennies on the dollar of what they're ceding to corporations and the rich (e.g. themselves)
Thank you President Trump for all you do!! Keep on tweeting away 

Why do you look like you're staring into the sun every time you talk
i love you jill

He from Russia love you long time time like flota
This is funny. All the Trump bashers are sitting, fingers on the keyboard ready to pounce.
All this Trump slander from the left is empty handed...
I notice the same names many times. Pathetic.
Thank you @POTUS
Can someone get POTUS a mic so he doesn't have to yell in his weekly address?
Who are you yelling at over in the corner there? Really odd looking to make the video that way. Btw I turn the sound off, better that way.
Hey Donald did you hear? @BenSFletcher desperately wants your attention. Bens feelings are hurt. Ben is a .....
Sir. There is just so much virtue signaling from liberals on your thread

to bad you weren't invited
I can't believe I'm even writing this but I'd take George Bush back over this Cheeto dust covered buffoon. @realDonaldTrump
sadly I agree with you. I never thought I would say that either
#33 seconds? Interesting..............

Terrible hidden tax increase for middle class! Republicans Consider Sharp Cut in 401(k) Contribution Limits
Yeah right! We know this is bullshit. Let's cut #Medicaid by trillions, force disabled kids to live in institutions to give tax breaks 

Mr President, THANK YOU for what you are doing for us, THE AMERICA PEOPLE.
RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz These RINO & @GOP Establishment #TaxPlans & #Healthcare Plans are NOT acceptable to #WeThePeople and #Americans
Stop spending Trills on endless War It's not rocket science & even ppl who can only read off of teleprompters should know the problem in US
Don't insult our intelligence! The richest 1% gets 64% of tax breaks & poorest 1% gets 1% of tax breaks? That's FUCKED UP & SO ARE YOU!!
You're just yelling.
You are going to kill the middle class by reducing 401k contribution allowances. Rich getting richer on the backs of the middle class.
Why do I want to celebrate billionaires getting richer & me getting poorer & doing without vital gov't services? U R a very cruel person.
Americans need a living wage, healthcare, fewer wars and a reduction in national debt.
Corp rate 25%, Middle Class 20%. Small Business should be CUT just as LOW 20-25% as others. More NEW JOBS from small biz than Corp!
Repeal the income tax and eliminate the IRS.
Will the biggest corporations still pay almost 0% due to tax loopholes and offshoring accounts or have you fixed that?
I'm praying for you Mr. President! We love you and were so blessed to get to see Jesus Christ real soon. Thank you, my Christian brother.
Thank you President Trump! The extremely wealthy 1%'s personal taxes must increase.   After a certain income level it is unfair for one person to keep retaining profits from the productivity of others.  I'm sure Bill Gates didn't personally assemble everyone's personal computers.

Once in a generation “opportunity” to destroy this country.  Shame on anyone who supports this scam
Before he messes with my taxes,  I want to see what he's paid.  #ReleaseYourTaxReturns

Will you force large corporations getting a tax break to pay their employees a living wage?No?Then how will their tax breaks "trickle down"?
No shit
The money always trickles down to Swiss bank accounts.
Exactly.  Which is why Democratic Socialism is needed...to curb unfettered Capitolism which has destroyed the USA as THE World leader.
If you were honest you would admit this is a historic windfall for the rich and addition to our national debt. Still the Snake Oil Salesman
Can you describe the exact ways middle class and poor people will benefit? #trump #usa #leadership #patriot #marketing #maga #honesty #motives #tax #TrumpTaxScam #TrumpTaxPlan
Dont let lazy ass congress watrr it down.......
Any fool who falls for this should be banned from Voting Machines for the next twenty years!
Behold this is a once in a lifetime deal to give most of your money for increased Taxes to give the Poor Filthy GOP who want more Tax Cuts.
Once in a generation further consolidation of wealth to the upper upper.  Support this and you support being ruled by an oligarchic class.

Said President Shit for Brains who hides his taxes that would prove his greed, gluttony and corruption. You make America Puke.
Smaller internal congressional budget would be a first start then reduce all agencies Budget, end duplicate progs. Etc!
Please shut them down if they start with "Paying for tax cuts".  In my Life if revenues decrease the budget decreases! Common sense!

great president 
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to offer historic tax relief to the RICHEST 1% American people.  Shame on you for lying!
I will not! You and your cronies are lying about this tax plan. It mainly benefits the highest income brackets. No thanks, loser.
#bone_spur_coward
Oligarchs aren’t rich b/c they tickle down. Show me the law requiring it. Many large Corp’s pay Zero already.

How is it even possible that one American citizen can trust a single word coming out of Trumps pie hole when he tells lie after lie?!amazing
#DrainTheSwamp! #MAGA3X! #TRUMP!
Does this mean you are throwing out the Trump/GOP tax plan? Because it's just a rehash of trickle down and a proven failure.
Thank you!!!!
Relief to the rich and corporations only. Selfish bastards!
You promised not to touch MEDICARE or MEDICAID. Now you drastically cut both to line your pockets.  You are a liar and crook. #Impeach Now!
Snake oil here! Snake oil here! Take advantage of this once in a generation chance to buy Trickle Down #SNAKEOIL
Thank you Mr President very much
Never, ever, ever, never side with a traitor!
Plse don't touch my retirement deductable, & social security deductable of 20k ea. Just earned income reduction. Id work 4 u in a sec.

What's happening in puerrrrto riiiiico? It's a once in a generation opportunity to stop murdering our fellow Americans through your neglect
Unless we're rich, we're all going to get fucked, because that's the way you roll.
Idiot
Sounds even more suspect than Reagan's old "Trickledown" economic voodoo.
Listen you big orange snotball. Your trickle down tax incentives will NOT work. Poor get poorer and rich get richer. Will not produce jobs!
MAGA
Liar liar liar
Aoj
To the rich, you mean. I won’t see more than a few dollars.
your so disillusion it's scary
Dear @POTUS,
Perceptions important.
9% FlatTax w/no loophole deductions, everybody same.
Incentive credits used to promote the greater good.
Your once-in-a-generation opportunity to offer tax cute to the Fat Cat Wealthy and Corporations is DOOMED TO FAILURE.
Slaver...backward christian crusader... pathological nut job...@SenateMajLdr @GOP a terrorist organization above the law. @DHSgov @FBI

How about we start by you releasing your tax returns. How much will this benefit you?
We the people have requested! 
https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/1-million-petition-trump-tax-returns/ …
Personally I think that everyone should pay a minimum of 5% Federal Tax any reported income at all, kind of like Social Security.
YEAH.....HISTORIC TAX RELIEF TO CORPORATE CEOS AND MY BILLIONAIRE BUDDIES & MYSELF..BUT I'LL NEVER SHOW YOU MY TAX RETURNS ! 
How about I don't and tell you instead to step down from presidency?

No, thanks. We know it’s not going to help the 99%, so why bother? Oh, because it will personally help you? Of course.

If you are a trump supporter who makes under $40,000 reply if you will benefit from the Estate Tax Reform.
You're a once in a generation flop as a president
Facts have a liberal bias and numbers have a middle class bias. And the numbers show that Trump-GOP are raising taxes on us middle class.
We don't need to lower our nation's income, we need to lower her debt! Take the money u r wanting 2 give away n use it to pay what we owe!
Perfect! Best President ever!

As a supporter from the very beginning I support tax relief 100% as a small business owner,also just repeal Obamacare,let free market work!
You mean, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to offer historic tax relief to the 1%!!
Why do you always look angry? Occasionally see you with that creepy ass smile too. Maybe it’s just that I can’t stand the sight of you.
Massive cuts to Medicaid! The middle class gets a little money back, but won't be able to afford mom's nursing home. Say hello 2 couch Mom!

N, u r our once-in-a-generation oppertunity 2 drain the swamp. Thank u 4 not giving up especially when many of  your own party r against u!
Have you watched yourself
You look like a two year old, but two year olds could read better then you 
#TeleprompterTrump
This is not going to help the average American! It’s only going to help the rich people, who really don’t need it!
You other video was much better. On this video your pronunciation was bad. You should have let Melanie done this one for you.

Would love to see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to end this shameful treatment of widows
Making a change so you can keep more of your change #TaxReform #MAGA
All of your supporters are with you!! Keep fighting to #MAGA
A once in a generation chance to make the 1% even richer! Get your facts straight! #ImpeachTrump
This tax plan combined w/ your insurance plan, 401 (k) capping, Medicare’s & social security cuts will drive the middle class into poverty.

Rob the poor, give to the rich, that's Trumps #1 campaign promise!
Hey this is great and all but can we build that wall now
Yeppers, historic for 1 percent. Resign TRAITOR
“What could possibly be more bipartisan?” ... impeaching your ass 
What about the deficit? Moron.
Scam artist
remember when the republicans were worried about debt and deficit? Those were the days, because those 2 things are about to explode.
You already add 1.5 trillions to the debt and now with tax cuts you are going to break the record. Also the 1% is getting richer. Great!
Less propaganda, more substance. This plan is similar in effect to so much attempted, but does not represent the middle class.
NO. You're liar and a fake president. #ImpeachTrump

You will save us thousands in taxes annually while providing us with higher earning jobs. And somehow Liberals will be angry over this.
Once in a generation for the rich to get uber rich thanks to putting one of their own in the white house.

You mean your plan is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rob from the poor and middle class and give more to the rich. #Sad
Blah blah. In other words, HUGE tax cuts for the rich. f@ck the poor, middle class and disenfranchised!
@realDonaldTrump , drain swamp, arrest and indict are most important in moving forward with Country love God and prayer America first 
If it’s not #FairTax it’s NOT historic @FairTaxOfficial #PJNET @Talkmaster
You need to address the nation on prime time TV to get the Dims on board. What moron wouldn't want their taxes reduced. 
Trickle down never works-- everyone can see that you are trying to turn this country into a Bigoted kleptocracy like RUSSIA
Aka ..... making my children richer
PSA: TODAY IS SGT. LA DAVID JOHNSON's FUNERAL, fuckturd.
I don't get it. Why is this a once in a generation opportunity? That sounds misleading to me. I think you're lying again.

Lying Trump is lying. This will increase our debt and deficit and harm America’s present and future. #LyingTrump #TrumpLies
None of the truly rich people like you, because you’re just a bottom feeding developer.  Why are you still trying to curry favor?
...stick to what you know.  Underachieving redneck racists and Nazis.
