Can I clarify - is this the 20,000 jobs that were announced in April last year?
Here's the introductory paragraph and the date it was published:
Thanks to @awb further down the thread for pointing that out. Here are some other news stories for context.
This is what Reuters said: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-charter-commns-idUSKBN16V22I …
This is from the LA Times:
And from ThinkProgress:
.@realDonaldTrump Honey, I know you're doing everything you can to distract people, but this isn't what anyone's thinking about today.
.@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry the reporter had to tell you the vote was called off yesterday while you were playing on the truck.
.@realDonaldTrump And sweetheart I'm SO sorry tricking people into signing a bad healthcare bill is harder than tricking them into Trump U.
Much like OBAMA lied to the American people about the Affordable Care Act ?  Here in MN no longer affordable
Read what is being proposed.
I am not saying this one is any better.  I am quite disappointed with republicans they had 7 years to get it righ
at least they will not let this go through like the Affordable Care Act did. I doubt any government official read
Having a baby in a hospital will cost working American families $20,000 have a nice day.
GOP had 7 years, controlled all 3 branches of government and still couldn't get a bill to the floor to repeal Obamacare!
Thanks to Obamacare, it looks like The Donald and Speaker Ryan just received a major colonoscopy on a Friday afternoon.
Not even the GOP believed Trump or Sec. Price about the made-up virtues of their healthcare bill. SAD! #EpicFail
New Trump Book Coming Soon:  
The Art of the Dea(d bil)l
Mr. Trump called himself a deal maker yet even since he took office their is no deal done nw blaming dems haha
Because He Is A Con Man, don da con
a real con man
these jobs were announced in April 2016 under President Obama
Whoops, busted again asshole!
Wouldnt be a normal day if Trump wasnt takin credit for something he didnt do
#ACA #Obamacare #ObamaWiretappedTrump #trumpcare #TrumpCuts







.@realDonaldTrump Are those the new figures for the secret service detail for New York, Mar-a-Lago and your extended family?
speaking of Mar-a-Lago shouldn't he be on his way there already.Quitting time is usually around 2pm on Fri
Yup!
I read that he's not going this weekend. Wonder why? Seems like a great way to celebrate!
Maybe he'll golf in Virginia so no one notices.
HA! He'll probably be on the phone with attorneys all weekend.
YES! WE love that guy from Texas! WE are getting used to that ROYAL WE! Pluralis majestix! WE speak LATIN, too!
And look at that AWESOME handshake we gave that guy who is such a GOOD FRIEND of ours!
We ALMOST looked at him! And we said to him: WE LOVE YOU! He looked happy like a CHILD that got to ride in a TRUCK!
And then those JOBS that were SHIPPED overseas! SO TERRIBLE! It's much better when we are shipping MAGA-HATS from overseas!
Ah, we are doing SUCH a great job by making CHARTER great again! They were bankrupt under Obama, but NOW they are thriving!
And it's all OUR DOING! Because we are such a MASTER at negotiating DEALS! Like that HEALTHCARE DEAL that is doing so well!
Ah, being PRESIDENTED is really A LOT easier than we thought! And look, it's FRIDAY again, time for some RELAXATION! #MAGA
time for Florida weekend
once again these jobs were already planned prior to you taking office. You are a fake president

lol!!!!
and we are thrilled every day to have you as our great President.
the Liberals can keep crying "Russian Hackers" it won't stop you.
the Left wants to stop America from reaching its full potential.
the Left knows that everyday that President Trump is in office they get weaker and weaker.
sabotaged Muslim ban by traitors, HC bill still being worked on, thousands of jobs created. Keep trying though.
no excuses, just WINNING @realDonaldTrump
How do you LIKE them Apples

that handshake 
i am cackling oh my god the handshake was so awkward
what the hell was that... my dog knows how to shake hands..

how's the repeal going? 
Haha, did you see Sean Spicey ballsed things up earlier? Don't mention the tax returns! 
Spicer: "I think there's a huge appetite for tax returns— *REFORM*." 
You also seemed "thrilled" yesterday. Or maybe you were soiling yourself, it's hard to tell.
vrooom vrooom I can lie all I want
Holy shit, his head is pretty damn big, or maybe his hands are small so that makes an illusion.
the only man dumb enough to thank his cable company
How do I double-like your comment?
I gotchu
Deal was made in October. But hey, take a “win” where you can get it, right?
yes trump was dealin in oct too lol
No, he wasnt lol
Let see the EVIDENCE. Where is all that EVIDENCE? You're full of BS.

Obama blamed his failures, and there were a lot, on Bush. You know, Mr Nobel Peace Prize winner Obama bombing Syria, causing migrant crisis.
difference is: 44 did actually inherit a mess, biggest recession in decades.
.@realDonaldTrump we will believe it when we see it.... kinda like the wire tapping claim...

You lied about this an hour ago. An hour later, it's still a lie. @realDonaldTrump
.@realDonaldTrump Actually, no. The Keystone XL pipeline will only create 35 permanent jobs. http://cnnmon.ie/2nQ3WHX 
Is it possible that the president's figure includes 19,965 people to clean up after leaks, etc?
I voted for you thought you were going to change government very disappointed regarding that i did
@Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump to be fair, he did change government. He made it far less effective and much more dangerous.
I'm not moving any of my jobs to Mexico. Can I get a RT?
fake news. Lol
Couldn't pass the #MuslimBan

Couldn't get Mexico to pay for the wall  

Couldn't repeal & replace #ObamaCare
hahahahaha this shit is too funny. 
appreciate it brother
Cool! they definitely will air your impeachment trial live!
Watergate. Look it up.
Judiciary Committee (included republicans) voted three articles of impeachment to the floor of the House. Idiot.
Hey kiddo, read my original tweet. You're running around the field with the goal post.
Somewhere, Richard Nixon is smiling.  @KajEriksen @barbaraward235 @realDonaldTrump
Tremendous commitment to American workers!
You know the Trumps employ foreign workers, don't you?
Yeah so do I because under current rules it was the profitable way to do things. Thankfully won't be anymore.
what rules? Nothing's been done
Current regulations that strangle business in the US. When he penalizes going overseas you'll
see a boost in employment here and a boost in $$ staying here instead of offshore due to lower
corporate tax rates.
but all those things... will never happen.  He promised a lot and will not be delivering
We will NOT allow you to destroy our country! #GoodByeTrump
y'all almost did by electing Hildabeast. And y'all allowed Obummer to destroy it.  #Trumpstays
Are you also thrilled #Trumpcare is going down in flames?
Yep, he got the big FU and I'm downright giddy
yo, @realDonaldTrump, how exhausted are you from winning this much?

Our "so-called" Negotiator in Chief…
He couldn't sell it! That would've required reading or listening to someone explain it to him. No way.
if it's not found on hannity or fox & friends it's not true...right???  #readinghurtshishead
Don't worry, he's like, a really smart person. Believe me.
you forgot the ALL CAPS and exclamation point(s)!!!!!!!!!!
you are a national embarrasement
How can you "announce" those jobs when @CharterNewsroom already did so back in October?
Part of a merger deal with Time/Warner, not a new announcement at all. He just lied.
Hmm... You mean, from the Obama administration? Whoda thunk?
I thought by now he would have had to stop taking credit for things that happened before election.
LOL
Excuse me, Mr. President -- the jobs were announced by @CharterComPR back in October -- before the election.
Taking credit for your predecessor again? This was first announced in 2015, again last year.
"Thrilled to announce a commitment" is made to make it sound new.
sorry about your healthcare flop lol
also committed to 24 million people losing healthcare
curious--- can u post ur source(s) on the 24,000,000 who will lose health care? I'd like to research it

No, the idiot Democrats screwed it up!
who's the idiot now
.@realDonaldTrump Let's recap:
#MuslimBan - Courts: "NO"
Muslim Ban 2.0 - Courts: "HELL no"
#TrumpCare - Congress: "HELL to the nah"
.@realDonaldTrump Quit and delete your account. The con is off.
muslim ban? Where did you get that?
From the court's block on enforcing his ban. Why they said it is unconstitutional.
well actually it's not a Muslim ban, otherwise no Muslims would be allowed in the US
it was a Muslim nan because he said hee would slow Christians from those counties in.
what's a Muslim nan?
THANK YOU OBAMA
Thank you for your continued DISTRACTIONS! Everything appears to be going swimmingly.
Those jobs were announced under Obama. Nice try.
"Today, I was thrilled to announce that along with terrible healthcare, I've also made sure millions will have terrible cable service too!!"
Call me a skeptic but somehow I feel like this will be helping a few wealthy individuals more than the average American.
call me a skeptic but you look like a fake account paid to consistently tweet back at Trump. Come clean!
Yes. I'm a verified bot. Great sleuthing, gumshoe!
it's either that or you have mental illness. #fraud
Sorry to hear you regard loving America as a mental illness.
no, sorry to hear you obsess about replying to Trump every possible tweet, as sanity. #seekhelp
I guess you could say I'm obsessed w ensuring the best possible future for America. Sorry you got conned!
you should be more obsessed with your journalism than tweeting back propaganda at Trump. Sorry you are ill 
Your idiotic health care bill was a huge success, too!
This distraction won't work.
Anything else going on today? #Trumpcare or something? #SavetheACA? Can't remember. Asking for a friend.
Old news, old man. This was decided before you got in WH. But then there's that whopping 35 permanent jobs with Keystone...
Loser, loser, loser.
OMG is this real??!!!
Ha Ha  got me good LOL
.@realDonaldTrump...#Obamacare? #RepealAndReplace? Crickets....
#Lies again by #Trump. How do you let him do this?
WHILE UR AT IT WHY DONT U OFFER SOUTH CHINA SEA CONVERTID INTO TRUMP HOTEL N CASINOS APPRENTANCE IN BEIJING MOSCOW AIRPORT$

sorry to interrupt your self-congratulatory tweet but they announced this in May. Thanks Obama!
if you cut the NEA you're sacrificing 4.13 million jobs
@allybrooke27 could you imagine what he could do if he didn't have all these distractions
thank you
Stop taking credit for things planned long before you managed to come to be president #AlternativeFacts  #NotMyPresident

What @realDonaldTrump means to say;
He's putting $25 BILLION in Big Polluters' PROFITS...
Jobs? What Jobs?
45 didn't actually READ ExOrders
once again taking credit for something you didn't do
Lies, Obama, had this all set up in 2015 now you attempt to claim credit for PRESIDENT OBAMA.
keep up the good work


Stop taking credit for things that had nothing to do with you. #impeachTrump #resist #notmypresident #youfucker
Great job President Trump, God Bless & protect you & give U strength & patience against all evil! #Pray4DJT
do what you promised and Drain the swamp.
@HouseGOP pathetic!
20  thousand jobs is not enough..i need a job now, can you help me??????????????????
nothing new here, claiming business already slated to happen before you, SAD!
Fabulous, but Sears(originally mail-order)closing/ PayLess filing bankrupt. Help for retail apart from internet if not via?
your doing a great job
You're a great businessman, Trump. You only went bankrupt 6 times. Vladimir Putin will always be proud of you (His Little Oompa Loopma).
" cc:@LorelaiKude 
Lori, Charter Communications  Oh my  
 "
look you can congratulate yourself all you want but you keep losing   Russia is going to get you and your cronies.
My, that empty universe of your head must really be something special...
thee are thousands of jobs left unfilled in tech. And in Agriculture. White US males don't can't fill them.. why??
I too love it when Charter buys all of its competition. I am sure ti will end up with good service XD.
Don't you mean thank you President Obama?
Lets call a spade a spade. This was REALLY a meeting about infringing on Internet privacy bill announced a day or two later
Uh don-the-con, u may have announced it, but the 20K job pledge was made 2 Obama. Try again. #epicfailure #weakpotus #sad #pathetic
a draft dodger honoring war heroes smacks of hypocrisy.
Sooooooo exciting......
#Maga #TrumpPromises
wrong and fake news
@DevinNunes #CrookedGop #TrumpRussiaCollusion #FlynnNunesTurkey  LOCK THEM ALL UP  The truth shall prevail U sir are guilty
Thank you, President Obama!
I'm sure when the truth comes out. This too will be a lie
That's the difference between having a businessman and a "community organizer" as president. Jobs.
You Lie!
You are the best president I have ever known!!! Thank you for being here to lead us!!!
this was all announced last year. Try and keep up, you're the president for Christ sake. Stop trying to take credit too.
Fake news! That deal was announced almost 1 year ago. You know, back when the prior President was in office.
start with manufacturing your furniture made in Turkey your ties and shirts made in China and ivanka clothes shoes purses
You know we don't believe ANYTHING you say, don't you?
bull shit.
While OBAMA actually WORKED on policies, @realDonaldTrump pretends Executive Orders is leadership
Obama CREATED JOBS
45 LIES abt Regulations
#jobs #Russianhacking #healthcare #Russianhacking #taxreform #Russianhacking #infrastructure #Russianhacking
you re actually clueless aren't you. Just resign, Donny
Cable? Another dying industry. Up there with all th coal jobs you're gonna save. What's next telegraph operators?
I bet it collapses in loser Donnie's lap over the next 4 years like everything else he is trying.
jobs already promised months ago?  More lies from #notmypresident
.@realDonaldTrump means this:
if obama hadnt taken yes we can that woyld have been a good one for u. Just like make ameica great again!
Thanks Obama!
Which has been planned for 2 years. The success you claim is someone elses. #FakePOTUS

Congratulations Mr. President, to you and to the Republic of America

Go Donald... You can make it!
This commitment was announced in 2015. Not your deal, never was your deal. A deal you had exactly ZERO part in.
Where is the DATA that PROVES removing Regs & rolling back CliimateChange increases jobs?
1. There is NONE
2. @realDonaldTrump can't read
AWESOME !!!
this was in the works long before you became POTUS Don. Don't take credit. You can take credit for the Trumpcare disaster.
Wasn't that deal brokered in 2015, you know, when the other guy was in office?
2015 contract.
; claiming jobs announced before the election.  how trite.
this was set up during Obama. u had nothing to do with this. ZERO

Today, I was thrilled to announce a commitment of $25 BILLION & 20K AMERICAN JOBS over the next 4 years. THANK YOU Charter Communications! 
this was agreed befor before before you came to be the somewhat president.
. Weren't these jobs committed over a year ago?
so is this what winning feels like #WorstPresidentEver #winning #alternativepresident
Once again..taking credit for things you didn't do. You never take blame for things you do. Obama did this in May 2016
oh please, that was a deal made well before you became President.  So thank you Obama
You are taking credit for a deal made under Obama in 2015. Shameful.
...if Dems try to stop Gorsuch, we want nuclear option applied.
explain how
Sir, thank you for making this powerful nation a GREAT NATION once again. Thanks to YOU!!!
I'm guessing you'll lose on this one they stink! @CharterSpectrum isn't worth a roll of toilet paper

Perhaps it's because you don't do any work of your own other than hold rallys and swear, align yourself w/worst of society
Really SAD. Why don't you get out while your name still means Something? You're going down fast & the rats are squealing.
So tired of hearing your bullshit & seeing your face everyday, Everyday! GET OUT before you are put in prison.
The Majority of the American People NEVER WANTED YOU, And Are Sick of Your Lies and Stupidity. You are Destroying America.
You don't care about the American people, never did. It's all about money with you, and for you. You are one sick SAD joke!
I Hate that I feel this way, every day! waking up, not knowing if you've gotten us into war, sold us out. Stupid,Weak man.
