Stop lying! About 4,000 people attended your rally (if you don't count those who left early). Want proof? Watch:
Our President  needs your  support  not this kind of talk, love him & try backing him
More fake news?
#GRABTHEIRPUSSIES
Thank you Arizona. Beautiful turnout of 15,000 in Phoenix tonight! Full coverage of rally via my Facebook at:… https://t...
Donald trump I just wanted to make your dad today..
Like, out of clay?
Tonight you proved why the 25th Amendment is so important.
15,000? Did you stop in Colorado for drugs on the way home?
Maybe 15,000 outside protesting. Half empty inside
Oooh, great point! 5,000 in attendance, 10,000 protesting = 15,000.
15,000?? 
I was there 

Looks like you are sharing the pictures before people started coming in
Fake News: 4169 final attendance.
That 15K included the cavaliers parade lol.
You're absolutely mentally unwell.
And anyone still defending you is an intellectually dishonest sycophant.
Only you could be so narcissistic as to tell the world that the real victim in Charlottesville was *you*. 

We've seen enough. #Resign
You seriously need to report how he felt after the rally. There is no way he was happy with that turnout.
Suuuuuch a tiny crowd. Maybe he was angry cause so few people showed up for his circle jerk.
This vid estimates 4000 at the rally. Donnie's really bad with math !!!
Hence the bankruptcies...
15,000? You're so full of shit.
What is that, 2K? A small swap meet?
They were paid too! Sad!
Any independent confirmation?
My friends took cash to go lol so yeah it's true.
Did they actually GET the money? I'd have insisted on payment up front.
Yeah, they paid in cash depending what n how you looked (attire) and how long you attended.
I'm only surprised that he actually paid.
LIAR.  You only had about 6,000 people. We all saw the video. Plus you use 'FAKE' photos of the Cleveland Cavaliers 2016 championship crowd.
Trump did NOT send this tweet out, it was someone else, damn people Everyone knows this isn Cleveland
You wrote "Everyone knows this isn Cleveland". That was your message. So you have a hard time writing.  I know which morons send the tweets
D - get it thru your head. Capacity in that room was 5000. And it wasn't full. Get over yourself. Stop lying. We cannot trust you.  SAD
So, what? The Phoenix Fire Dept lied when it said the capacity of the building was 4,200?
Lie of course. Only holds 4,900. People also left early as ur crazy rambling bored them. And that was ur supporters.
We have a new teflon Don nie, it's everyone else's fault not mine. Your gonna stop gov. If they don't fund THEWALL that mexico is paying for
lmao
Sad that "supporters" needed to be paid just to attend
Falso quede gracias cundo diario deporta jente ipocrita
Less than 5000. Since you lie by a factor of three, are you claiming what, about 4.5"?
L.I.A.R!!! Make the White House great again again, throw out the trash! #DumpTrumptheLiarInChief
Lol 

Hall only fits 4,200
Where did the extra 10-12,000 people hide? The capacity of that exact room is 5,000 and it was almost half empty..
Venue held 4200 so how did you fit 15k and still have all that open space? Awwww were you counting the protesters? That's so cute. LIAR!
Another day, another lie. #TrumpResign #25thAmendmentNow #ImpeachTrump
https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-08-28/trump-is-said-to-punish-longtime-aide-after-angry-phoenix-speech …
How many of those in attendance did you pay?
Funny, the venue only holds 5,000. Apparently you can't count high even with those #littlefingers
Liar

There were only 2,000 there and the crowds thinned the more you rambled on!
When the crowd doesn't fluff him sufficiently, he finishes the job himself.
What a lie!!  There were nowhere near that many at your pathetic rally!
"Capacity for the event space was 4,200 people. At final count, 4,169 people attended" 

~ Phoenix Fire Department
He sucks at math.
Fraud
Per the fire Marshall the building holds less than 5,000!
More lies. Check with the Fire Department.
Benedict Nazi Donnie, Big Putie gets 3,000,000 every time - even in Siberia. Don't your stooges know how to multiply by more than 10?

4000 you don't get to count 1000's of protestors outside
You're a lair, there were under 5,000 people there hahahaha #presidentidiot #liar #pieceofshit
Liar! You are mentally ill. You should be removed from office. Hurry Mueller!
Brawhahahahahaha you are such a liar as usual. The event space only holds 4k. Did you mean the peaceful protestors in the streets?
Dude why are you going around to these things?  Do you need people to cheer for your hurt ego?
What's more concerning; POTUS lying about amount of people at rally, or fellow Americans blindly accepting what he says. 4,000 not 15,000.
Uh those were 15,000 protestors... #Delusional as always... there's your #fakenews or would this fall under #alternativefacts? 
I am proud of your decision to pardon a lifetime law enforcement officer instead of a traitor or drug dealer
LIAR!!! Capacity was only 4,200 and only 4,169 attended PER THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
And you had 10,000 protestors...
Only 4000 people showed up. Stop lying
The place only holds 4200 people. The other 11000 people were protestors!
"But the city fire department said capacity for the ballroom where Trump spoke was 4,200 people." Where'd you put the others?
Hmmmm.  Think the Phoenix Fire Department begs to differ.
Go Trump Go ! ! !
"Capacity for the event space was 4,200 people. At final count, 4,169 people attended" 

~ Phoenix Fire Department
Fire Marshall: venue fits 5,000 Nice try Mr. Lying Eyes!
The black guy in the back must of been paid big time and a couple of homes
Wrong!  4200
The place only held 2000, must be " fake math"
You're lying. There's no question. You're a liar.

4,169 attended.
Just makes me wonder how many of them were paid. Some just don't appear to be real at all. Just another fake stunt.
Liar there was not 15,000 smh
You had 2500 max.  The fire marshal already exposed your FAKE NEWS.  #25thamendment
@realDonaldTrump - the real total was 4,169 MAX. Why do you lie so much dude? #ImpeachTrump
Don't u have any work to do? If u were on ur own show, you'd fire yourself for being lazy and not contributing to the team.
I think you got the numbers wrong again...fire dept says a mere 4100 attended your pathetic rally.  Sad!
you are a fool and a liar!!
#LiarInChief #Losers
Basically the crowd dynamic in Phpenix too. Your small #Cult45 and multitudes marching in opposition
HOW did you manage to pay that many ppl to attend? Must have paid a lot to get them to come out that heat!
The venue only holds 5000 you delusional racist . RESIGN
HAHAHA!! Venue max of 5,000, and not even that was close to full. Get a grip. When will you learn that WE. SEE. EVERYTHING!? Liar.
4,169 attendees & even then you paid many ethnic minorities to attend!
wow, you are popular
Liar. Phoenix Fire Dept certifies less than 5000 attended.
more like 300 people LOL
Fake President
How did you fit 15,000 into a venue that only holds 5,000? You're such a liar!
Those must be some good meds you're on! You hallucinated 10,000 more than the venue holds!
Liar
Since the fire marshal only allows 5k for the venue and it was maybe half full, the only way there was 15k was if you count the protesters.
The event space has a capacity of about 4,200... FAKE NEWS FRIM DJT!!!!
