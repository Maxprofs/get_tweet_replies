Mike Pence's #VPDebate strategy seemed to be "if you close your eyes, Trump doesn't exist." 
Gotta admit, Pence out-shined the top of the ticket. Pretty embarrassing.
Waiting on your list for Trump.  

Is there even anything besides inheritance?
Is finding a Trump accomplishment too difficult?  My list wasn't even complete.
ONLY a fool would believe this serial liar, see for yourself:
@Kleptocratia @DoodyGiuliani1 @steveclarkuk   @aimeedcornett @Mr_Flopnuts Did #ClintonFoundation gain $6 billion? #Corrupt

Mr. Trump. SincePence won last night. Media doesn't want you to feel good. That is why they say he wants 2020. He is loyal.
As a Small business owner 15% tax rate is all i need to hear.  He has my vote because of that
i don't believe this. you've taught us not to trust what the media says. this is probably dishonest. nice try, media.
@timkaine So anyone that takes the standard deduction on their tax return is essentially Un-American.. So, that's everyone.

@CNBC Donald Trump accepted you are going to lose big-time big time Big Time loser
@CNBC thank you President Trump. The jobs candidate
Obama is the jobs PRESIDENT. A record 37 some odd months in,a row with job growth.
@gene70 @LoriIoannou1. I'm a business owner and I am for Clinton

@CNBC I own a small business. I think Donald Trump is a national embarrassment and have already voted (absentee) for HRC
Good luck dealing with Obamacare and minimum wage hikes since both are "good" for business...Lol.
Both ARE good for business, unless you want a perpetual welfare state that still costs more.
@CNBC yes
@act4biafra_now  Congrats in advance!

you mean like Hillary did??? She avoided paying taxes by donating millions to her own foundation. Freak!!!!!!
@CNBC
Omar Matin who shot up the club in Orlando is America's worst mass shooter also Hillary supporter...
Yep, but @realDonaldTrump, that was before they found out they were all paying tax and you weren't...
So did Trump break any tax laws?
EXCEPT YOU LOST WITH WOMEN, BLACK AND HISPANIC BUSINESS OWNERS!
WRONG! #Latinas4Trump ¡Viva Trump!
Never said any such thing
@CNBC another lie! !!...Trump is a huge TURD! And a liar! ! ! ! ! !
The reason why some women are not voting for Trump, because of his"mouth". He should apologize say he will try  to improve
Pick of every honest American.  Sick of this corrupt, criminal, crap of the DemocRATS, & now the FBI.  My GOD, what next?
@CNBC No doubt about it!

This is the shit you get when all the REAL polls hate you :)
@JOMainEvent @CNBC Family member could not hold on any longer... Lost it this year-But they did not vote wisely.
20+ years-good wages-long time employees-good healthcare=(that went first w/O-care destroying healthcare).
@LoriIoannou1 These are real problems that you and new leadership can start to fix!
@LoriIoannou1 We don't need more PC robots running the world for their own financial gain
@CNBC - No we don't
I hate to see how much taxes you will have to pay, Donald doesn't pay any, and owes a lot of money to a lot of people !
is the obvious and only choice. Clinton is a disaster for small businesses.
.@realDonaldTrump under your plan of less regulation and lower taxes, I can seriously consider my dream of owning my own business #MAGA
hillary said the government is the answer to all questions.  Clueless.. I dont have time to sit around looking at my navel

@CNBC  Trump all the way  !
@LoriIoannou1 -wow, so he ca show them how to go bankrupt then stiff people out of $
Hillary' husband's "Freddie & Fannie" caused Bush's economic meltdown via Housing Bubble, NOT giving businesses tax relief.
'Small business says #DopeyDonald picked their pockets: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/ … #GrifterGotToGrift @GOP #GOP
Manta? poll, Rasmussen??? poll. Where did you dig up these offshore pollsters. Oh, outside of US jurisdiction, I get it.
@CNBC YES!! Because we know tax cuts help MAIN STREET small businessman build, hire & GROW! NOT just 4 !rich! CLINTON LIE!!
Not if you get in and since you scammed everyone, those loopholes are sure to disappear, quit taking credit for your taxes!
@CNBC Only those Trump slapped his name on.

I would like to be hired by the FBIs electronic demolition division.  I love smashing electronic devices.
@CNBC My son looked into a small business. Too many regs/taxes & GOVERNMENT hassles. Trump will right the ship.
@CNBC Which small business? I'm thinking confederate flag manufacturers that outsource to China!?
I hope these two are not going to kiss each other.
.@realDonaldTrump Hillary could be literally dead, a zombie, and actively eating my brain, and she'd STILL be 1000x the POTUS you would.
@LoriIoannou1 oh yeah small business is a great guy so cool that he endorsed you
How do you expect to win while only leading in 1 demographic? Without the majority of women & minorities the math is bad4U
"Except among women". You DO realize that women make up half of the population and of small business owners, right?
@CNBC   yeah + that means small business will mean out of business.
@LoriIoannou1 yes! DT loves all US business- art of the deal is US art- poetry in motion!
@CNBC you mean you actually found some that you haven't stiffed???? LOSER #Hillary2016
there is a reason big businesses supporter Hillary. Cause they know you!
@CNBC. Amen, and this small business owner is also voting TRUMP
@CNBC Small business people who had to file bankruptcy because Donald refused to pay?
are you talking about the small businesses that went bankrupt because you wouldn't pay them
daddy
Small business in the US is roughly 85% of ALL bidnesses.
If this is true you are business disaster! And have been since the 70's http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-records-506713 …
gosh no one polled me! You are deplorable Mr. Trump!
@CNBC EXCELLENT YOU SAID ITS GOING TO CREATE JOBS.  THE TRUMP NAME ALREADY CREATED MILLIONS DURING ELECTION.
@CNBC http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/business-leaders-endorse-hillary-clinton-224706 …
Doesn't "except for among women" also mean "only among men?"  Way to skew!
@CNBC I thought CNBC was biased?
And Small Business is what is Important
What small business? Trump steaks?
@CNBC No shit Sherlock
#Hillarymakeswomenlookstupid
Mr Trump
On the debate stage next Sunday, Please Ask Crooked Hillary: What have u billed?
@CNBC Yes when you have Hillary acting like she does not know that losses on a business is a legal carry over, choice clear
I wanted u know that the VA can't treat all the vets because u did not paid u'r fare share of Taxes,see the damage u did
@CNBC Interesting since he screwed so many small business people over.
@CNBC Something is seriously off with these polls.  What were they all in Red States?
@LoriIoannou1 2 babies shot in Cleve. In a drive by. THEY WERE IN THEIR HOUSE!!!  We need Trump!! Obama/Clinton do nothing.
