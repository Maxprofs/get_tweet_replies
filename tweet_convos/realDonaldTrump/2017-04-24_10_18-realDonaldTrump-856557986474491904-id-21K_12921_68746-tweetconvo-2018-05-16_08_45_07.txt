You are health carefully shoved aside, care underused, rushed to infection. Need is feral.
If your plan is approved millionaires just get richer...those who fall ill go bankrupt in order that the millionaires can get even richer
You could probably have a decent National Health Service like a civilised first world country on what you've p*ssed away at Mar A Largo
Haha I agree with that! He still wants the perks he enjoyed as CEO of a huge company, but paid for by his own taxpayers. It's interesting
cos he doesn't want to be POTUS
Anti-Trumps need to be careful though, as Pence is someone I really don't like. There's no getting rid of Trump before the next election.
Again sir it's not bad insurance for some people Obamacare was working for some of us
If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down. ObamaCare is in ...
I am 60 and living in Florida you can bet my insurance will go up.

If your healthcare plan is approved, you will see real people without insurance start tumbling down. You will put them in a death spiral!
Take the federal government out of the healthcare business.
It was working ok til Obama fucked it up
None of the lower class had healthcare before Obamacare, what will they do now?
Get a job and increase there worth
Real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down if you contributed to the Rump campaign.
1.   Who is " our"?  
2.   You have no plan. 
3.   Health care is two words. 
4.    ACA is doing just fine.
5.   Why are you compelled
Please pressure Congress to repeal and replace. I am tired of hearing McConnell claim we don't have the votes.
Ha ha you are very funny for a fake president!
whatever
Lol.  Instead death for the dying and money in your pocket and your friend's pockets ... Over sea banks help don't they.. probably.
I assume the new law will give $$ to those men who need viagra & orange hair treatments
Healthcare was always available online for 50$ a month but now the gov runs it and fines people through Taxation.
Yeah doing away with preexisting conditions charging the elderly 5 times more for premiums which won't effect me since I pay 0.
Oh thats right you dont like math it will still be 0. Ohio voters not happy neither are coal miners. This country isn't your personal bank
Sorry Pal, U'r 100 Days R Up. What You Promised Didnt Happen: Repeal And Replace #Obamacare #MuslimBan 
+ Dont Get Me Started on U'r Cabinet
@exoticgamora @realDonaldTrump  Couldn't be worse than the shape you have gotten our beloved country in Trump.
How did you get a minus in likes? Is there a dislike button I don't have? I got you back to even

Still waiting
Unfortunately government is still involved so sad for the free market
So in the richest country we will have turned everyone but the top 1 percent into poor people who is running our country. Can we stop them
@NASA @AstroPeggy kbhi kuch nhi mila as liya aj bhi balance nhi karwao ga yar no on face instagram
Our freaking citizens will be in a death spiral if this bill passes. Premiums will go down because people are gonna be dying.
A negative and a divisive message
I hope so
LIAR !
Premiums are the only thing going down.  Amount of coverage is too and the policy isn't worth the paper it printed on.
Can't wait to see Ocrappy Care leave. We REALLY need a change
Trump - a go getter - Obama - a do nothing!
Obummer was an idiot! I hated him but I love you! So happy you're my President!
Great efforts produce great results!
I'm retired military  can't afford  diabetes meds. Moving every few years expensive we don't own our home like our friends who stayed home
Go Donald!!!!!
Obamacare was obviously designed to crash the system so that people would cry out for single payer
Nearly 20% of my take home and that doesn't even count the higher deductibles. I'm actually looking forward to Medicare.
My side of my employer paid plan more than doubled under Obamacare. I now pay $9,600 per year for a basic family PPO.
Thief! You just want to steal money from the hard working American Middle and low income classes so you and your friends get richer!
Your healthcare plan has too many flaws to pass obamacare isn't in a death spiral your lying to yourself if you think your plan will pass
You Are death
we think you are in a spiral yourself and on your way down.
And Trumpcare will put people into deathspirals, unless they're rich of course.
What about pre-existing conditions?
Glad to see you're so proud of once again fucking the people of the US completely.  How do you not see how reprehensible you are?
Ok!
Thanks for fucking America over again.
Idiot
If all of congress and people working or living in the White House are exempt from the new healthcare bill, it is no good!
I hope it crashes soon!
Its called the affordable care act...this isn't a competition...represent us please
I cannot believe the scam your trying to feed Americans. You will be hurting those who have the greatest need and giving more to the rich.
We all hate it and your approval ratings as well as protest show what we think of you
please know not all pre-existing could be helped . My daughters RA isn't her fault . I fear for many with health problems !
From a mother with cancer who has a daughter with RA we need Good health care and not have pre-existing . I voted for you
This man is nuts!   Not my president?
I hear trump is going to be traveling over seas, maybe they'll keep him, WE DONT NEGOTIATE WITH TERROISTS!   KEEP HIM!
why are we not seeing details of the healthcare plan? Is this more you have to pass it to see what's in it?
Meaning every will die under your leadership
Mr. President so far absolutely love you as our president a plus thank you for everything you've done and to come
it's not a competition. We all know you're intimidated as fuck by Obama and secretly admire his greatness
1qqqqq
@realDonaldTrump that's REAL healthcare!!
@realDonaldTrump In Sweden you can stay at home when you've given birth for 1,5yrs without loosing your job or salary.
@realDonaldTrump In Sweden you can get sick and have surgery without going into bankruptcy! You don't have to pay a fortune to see a doctor
In Sweden we have REAL healthcare and our economy is great! Kids go for free until age 20, it's the same with dental! @realDonaldTrump
Will you marry me and fly me over?
Sorry.. Already married 
the #ACHA is a direct attack on the most vulnerable citizens in this country. You are an embarrassment! #VoteNoAHCA
CBO report? Push through a major reform without oversight. You are not king
NO DEPENDABLE MEDICARE. Instead it is a slithery slope to non coverage. Imagine What all these Voters will think of you? failed them.
Dear God, arm twisting senators who have to take this bill to their constituents will loose their jobs NO DEPENDABLE pre condition coverage.
I would still get rid of all the disloyal republicans starting with Ryan. He doesn't have your best interest at heart.
Your a true blessing to us the working class , Thank you so much Mr. PRESIDENT
BS
ACA isn't politics.  It's LIVES MATTER.  These guys are idiots.   All for rich man taxes we rush
@maddow healthcare rush all for DT tax break....we think.....perhaps......maybe.....sort of
if Jc passed today hurray for dems impending elctions.   GA 6th
Now just patients will be in a death spiral!  Whew so glad you guys are able to save the profits of the nations insurance companies!
We want #singlepayer #UniversalHealthcare #MedicareForAll
Bullshit
I sure hope this is true but there is a loophole with the lapse in coverage in there that will cost Americans you should have fixed.
I can help
I wish you were in a death spiral!
I back you 100%, but my concern is about preexisting conditions being covered. Hopefully, you'll have the in the plan.
I'm excited
No we won't
What's up with Ivanka wanting Syrian refugees to come into our country.Whaaat?  We will not sacrifice anything for their agenda of evil.
No one believes you anymore! When you lie all the time how can we?
You can't delete Obama from the history!
Your plan allows insurance companies free reign to increase premiums and profits. It will end insurance for millions and put people in hawk!
YOU LIED BEFORE. SAYING IT WOULD BE BETTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE.  BOY WHO CRIES WOLF.
Need a better health care
Keep lying. Why do you hate America and her people, sirrah?
We as a nation need to figure out how we reduce HC cost and if the industry does not want to work with us in doing that, go to a public HC!
Does anyone ever address the cost of HC and how that unregulated industry is bankrupting this country and the American people?
Premiums will never go down for full coverage.
The only people who love Obamacare are the people who are getting free coverage.
America doesn't punish one group.of citizens to help another. Everybody pays their own way.
If you don't get rid of the mandate, you might as well keep Obamacare.
Americans people don't want that B.S. you offered,  and tell Paul  to go f...k his self.
If?  Need to get health care done. Every time Republicans have an opportunity - you guys shoot yourselves in the foot.
IF premiums go down, it will be because policies dont cover anything expensive. No ER, no prescriptions, no hospitalization, no preventative
USA is in a death spiral
You have all of us in a death spiral
Way to cater to big Insurers and not the American People.  More of the same from Mr Swamp Dictator
Like home loans and car insurance, the only people who will see lower costs will be those have NOT used their insurance in past 365 days
If I keep telling everyone that ObamaCare is not doing well it will eventually become true, right? I have no idea what I'm doing?#suckers
Another day another lie!!!
Love you Donald you  will  be  good  for the USA
Don't think so Don
You should subscribe to Trump Care for your family with no PPO.
Thank you Dr President!
NOTICE IT'S THE SAME FEW PEOPLE WHINING N GOING ON N ON N ON...GET OFF LINE N READ A BOOK, SUGGEST "THE BIBLE" LEARN SOMETHING WORTHWHILE..
You should probably read the bill. Then, delete your account.
The government shud not be in the health care business.
Sure hope so.
Make it better and don't take away from old people and disabled
Have you even read it?
Make a signal savings with big Pharma! Combine Medicare, Medicaid, Military & VA Rx & win their biggest deal yet!
Healthcare? Fix it now! Cut state boundaries, enact tort reform, CMS overhauls, telemedicine, small pools...
You make a lot comments about what good your going to do. What kind of guarantee will you make to the American public. @realDonaldTrump
dude, just do single payer.. save everyone a LOT of money
You mean for healthy twenty year olds if obama care was perfect you would still get rid of it it makes you stupid just wait for trumpcare
Planned Parenthood claims they treat women. They lie! They are only set up to refer or kill.
Planned Parenthood does NOT have the staff or facilities to treat women's healthcare issues but they are equipped to kill.
Planned Parenthood is paid to refer women with health issues for treatment. They don't treat, they only kill.
Why are we still agreeing to fund Planned Parenthood? They DO NOT serve women's health issues or families!
Praise God Hallelujah
I can only .  I can't afford necessary treatment.
yes, mr.Trump what is your plan
Hahahaha
This tired old rhetoric is in a death spiral. Circling the drain. Sad.
Yeah, like 12% of the people can afford that
How can anything you say be trusted? Most reviews of the previous plan indicated it wasn't going to work long term? So what's changed?
Its easy to have low premiums when nothing is covered.
Why not fix the AFFORDABLE care act, lots easier than forcing people to go without as your buddy Ryan wants.
Except for people over 60. At 65 Medicare will no longer be guaranteed  lowers Medicare tax and when trust is gone good luck seniors
Remove state lines to allow competitive health care
insurance…create/apply standard pricing for all medical procedures &
prescription meds.
You do realize that the Affordable Care Act, allegedly in a death spiral,  is wildly more popular than you are, right? That has to hurt. 
we're putting a lot of trust in you President Trump. Pease do not let us down.
You don't have a healthcare plan!  Congress isn't going to pass a thing for you.  The only thing tumbling down is your ratings!
