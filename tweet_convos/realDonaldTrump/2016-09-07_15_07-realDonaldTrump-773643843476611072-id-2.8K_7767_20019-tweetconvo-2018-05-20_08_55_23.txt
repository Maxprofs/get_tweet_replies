Hillary has never served, and Bill was a draft dodger so there is that...
Hillary looked like a commander in chief tonight. Trump didn't.
Hillary will not do that. Well be communist in 2 years, and she will wipe black people out
1. Women didn't serve in the military when Hillary was of age.  2.  Trump was a draft dodger.
so was bill Clinton. What's your point?
Bill Clinton doesn't go around saying "I'm the most militaristic person ever" and "I love war".
Bill Clinton doesn't say shit like : http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-military-service-213392 …  "I always felt i was in the military"

#Trump2016 - words are cheap, especially for DELUSIONAL DT. He let this group of kids down! https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/07/here-it-is-usa-freedom-kids-v-donald-j-trump-for-president-inc/?tid=sm_tw_pp&wprss=rss_the-fix …
#Trump2016 - seems as if DELUSIONAL DT let his TOP staffers down: http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/09/03/report-trump-stiffed-10-staffers-out-of-pay.html?via=mobile&source=copyurl …
