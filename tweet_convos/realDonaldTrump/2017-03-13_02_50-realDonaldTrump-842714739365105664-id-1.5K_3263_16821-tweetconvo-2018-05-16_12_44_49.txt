@realDonaldTrump thank you President Trump for all your hard work! 
You put #Jesus in your profile, but Trump is the most un-Christ-like president ever.
no that would be Obama
You mean the guy still on his 1st wife who worked to help the poor? Ok.
Lol, Obama didn't help the poor. He just let thugs act like thugs.
Also instead of "thug" why don't u say n-word like u want to
No, I  meant thugs. There all races. The n-word isn't color stupid.
Send me 3 examples of "thugs" I bet none are white

And yet Trump cites the NYT as the evidence to back up his baseless wiretapping claims?

Resist greatness?
All under Obama's budget. Trump's budget won't take effect until 10/01/17.
Works for us. So, go back and reminence over Hillary's poll numbers

Be care what you wish for it may be too late to turn back the clock..
Let Obamacare crash and burn I say, total embarrassment.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews wow you found one...one
gee, @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump why did it crash and burn?  You control the house, the senate and the presidency.  So sad.  Pathetic.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews YES! Freedom from the mandated oppression...Thank you! Now let's work on erasing those state lines!
The crux is whether the AHCA leverages antitrust rulesets to curb insurer profit to extent Cit comes 1st.
15% think it doesn't screw enough people.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews good thing the American people have the top negotiater on their side. President Donald J Trump
How'd negotiations for Mexico to pay for the wall go again?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews GOP once agreed 100% on obama care when it was their plan! 
This is bad bill unless you're trying to dismantle the govt. Ryan would never support any tax-funded prog.
"[sure the GREAT POTUS has plenty of clothes on!" He only believes what he wants to believe.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews GOD DAMMIT!! Pay attention. We don't want or trust TRUMPcare!
TRUMP - PAUSE A MOMENT - TRY SOME OLD TRACKS!  YOU CAN DO IT - I THINK YOU CAN!
Wonder WHERE he got his insight?
@realDonaldTrump MORE LIES.. 

But please pass it.. It will destroy the GOP and you..

The 15% is the biggest part. No matter how you slice it that 15% needs to be removed. The Paul Ryan section must go with him!
@realDonaldTrump #trumpryancare is a mass murderer. LOCK THEM UP!!
What are you saying?  You love Obamacare?  That's nuts.

@realDonaldTrump GOP=Greedy Old Perverts
@realDonaldTrump lie!
More Faux News. Please change the channel or better yet actually educate yourself on the bill and refer to your promises.

trump care is corporate welfare
@realDonaldTrump - art of the deal. Tax Cuts!
I'm a republican and I don't agree with trumpcare, you're gonna fuck over a lot of people with this.
Lando Calrissian agrees on over 85% of agreement with Empire!

Killing people seems like a really swell way to save money. You bast ard.
Somebody get these fools out of the WH before there is a civil war. Damn they're stupid. Should have had this figured out 3 yrs ago!
@realDonaldTrump the health care bill will fail with @SpeakerRyan version. Open your eyes and get more involved in this mess
America disagrees with 100% of it. Now go get your spanking from Britain,stupid.

that's bullshit ... and the greedy companies that are taking advantage of these poor people should face jail time
Do some research. Not bullshit. Deport & marginalize 11 million people and our economy will take. Fruit and veggie….

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends  we need to work out what won't work ! Out should be Obama anything -
@realDonaldTrump false news
Well, they are all scum, so...
Trumpcare is a disaster.  Good luck taking Away ACA from your supporters.
A good man for the country and Louisisna
@realDonaldTrump That's because they're all scum sucking bottom dwellers.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump sounds like 85% of the GOP is out to screw over the general population of the country they represent.
the other 15% don't think it's enough screwing of the people.#resist #donthecon
Just like the GOP to offer them 1/10 of the care at a small discount and their followers think they won the lottery.
- MORE LIES
FOX IS FAKE NEWS!
Great .....can't wait for the GOP to screw their supporters!  They need a good wake up!
24,000,000, including many who stood by Mr. Trump, will lose their healthcare.
TrumpCare = DumpedCare
Trump Care will put millions off insurance.
let's put millions of americans out of healthcare! who cares about the poor!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews this is where you need to stand up to GOP who do not have interest of all Americans in this bill
Absolute bullshit from the desperate
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews.  
Wonder if you realize what you just tweeted? Your own party DISAGREES with 15% of what is in your bill.
please continue protection of health sharing groups like Samaritan Ministries &Medishare.
@realDonaldTrump 85% isn't enough it's all or nothing
@realDonaldTrump Which parts? Millions losing coverage? Rich ppl getting tax cuts so higher cost for less coverage for poor?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews well of course they do, it benefits the rich and takes from the poor. That's how those ghouls roll.
If you jump 85% of a 3 feet hole, you still fall..
FAKE NEWS
Whatever GOP's pass Trumpcare will be out of job. All of you are out of touch with average Americans.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews FOX NEWS....Trump ball washers using their tongues.
FOX NEWS FAKE NEWS.
Any by doing so, they show their cruelty,lack of compassion to the weakest,most vulnerable.Monsters!
@realDonaldTrump  If you'd quote real news we might believe you. It would also help if you'd quit lying constantly. Fake news
@realDonaldTrump Sorry! Like Trump, I can NO longer believe with what you say.  I choose America over "PARTY" #lostViwer!
Isn't there a rule of thumb about the last 10% requiring 90% of the time/effort?
Health care should be free if we cannot help each other how do we expect a change for the good of all.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We want FULL repeal of Obamacare as was promised.
Keep the IRS out of of this. No rules than require Gestapo tactics , usually used against non-supporters,
@realDonaldTrump  In Six Sigma terms.....FAILURE
@CNN @ABC @CNBC @ABCNetwork @maddow REALLY? http://www.addictinginfo.org/2017/03/19/watch-paul-ryan-gets-his-a-handed-to-him-by-fox-host-on-gop-healthcare-plan/ … ? Steve not doing his research again?
not enough to pass. Not even close. So sad to see this garbage. Just pathetic.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews look...If we wanted to hear the news from anyone... You'd be the last person we'd trust!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @GOP @dccc and just a couple of votes will kill the bill!

@realDonaldTrump TrumpCare is a disaster for the American people. Let's see how the red states fair

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews lies, lies, more lies
#trumprussia
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews

@realDonaldTrump because the GOP disdains the poor. @SpeakerRyan thinks poverty is something he could catch. Like an STD.
@realDonaldTrump Guess that means he's as stupid as Ryan. #TrumpDontCare is a bust. & #MealsonWheels won't be going anywhere
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews lie
