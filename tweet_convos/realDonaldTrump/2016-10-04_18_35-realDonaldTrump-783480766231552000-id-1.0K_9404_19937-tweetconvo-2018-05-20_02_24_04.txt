You should check your facts again
YOU 2 MEN  HAVE GOT THIS ELECTION .    #DONALDTRUMP   #MIKEPENCE
no they don't
You came to Abingdon VA DJT. Now let sum1 show the rest of SWVa & SEKy's economic collapse after coal
ok, tell us all. do you and Pence ever rank women on a scale of 1-10. If he more lenient than you?
Too stupid to understand the trend?

Why not consider education?

It won't make your tiny button any bigger but you may just learn something.

#ImpeachTrump #TheResistance #Resist #Resistance #TrumpRussia #FireAndFury #ImpeachTrumpNow
it's really sad when people are stealing your signs right out of my handicap husband yard we need you bad
and killed women's rights
LIARS!!!
He also restricted unions. You can hire more people when you pay them less than a living wage..
#votegaryjohnson2016 @GovGaryJohnson will create jobs just like he did for his home state!!
Skewed assessment again Don.  One was governor in recession the other in economic upswing.  Spin it!
This is PLAIN out factually false... I hate how Trump followers never do any research on what he says
Man, you did yourself SO right with him!
Never Trump. The worse person on the planet!
Probably not...
Pence signing his LGBT discrimination act cost his state millions of dollars. @realDonaldTrump @timkaine @mike_pence
The record stands on its own.  Compare.

Kreepy Kaine.
and @mike_pence also caused companies to leave Indiana due to his hateful laws against LGBT
Never Trump
more lies
ya during the recession for Kaine  after Obama's recovery for Pence, more blatant lies,
Trump makes jobs & Hillary makes excuses and turns them into Major Lies. In 30 years she failed us.
that's why you need to make America great and be our President
@julieroginsky ...answers?? Or just disgusting attacks??? #TrumpPence16 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Kaine says Hillary stopped Iran's nuclear program, Now that lie can kill us all
Thank you!
Even if you were telling the truth, why should we believe you? You lie every few minutes, so this can't be believed
 LIAR!

INDIANA VOTERS FRAUD GOING ON AS I TELL YOU THIS
AND MORE HATRED FOR LGBT

.
#GoPence he's actually fixed unemployment! Tons of business leave Illinois for Indiana all the time
Yes! we need jobs for Americans, not foreigners, especially not illegals!
@riwired @timkaine @mike_pence Shouldn't you be busy not paying taxes and not serving your country?  #inlovewithPutin
You can fool some of the people some of the time but not all of the people, all the time. #DumpTrump
How many jobs were lost along with that $1 billion Donald Trump lost?
Very deceptive b/c Kaine was GOV 1/2006-2/2010 and Pence was GOV 1/2013-now. Recession vs OBAMA
Good think Pence was Gov during Obama recovery while Kaine was Gov during Bush failure. #Fact
it might be relevant to look at what years they were in governor's office.
Mike Pence is the perfect person for your vice president...
You should talk about the trillion dollar debt she wants 2 kp going like Obama.
- let the numbers speak for themselves. Ask yourself- would I hire this person to manage my business?
You're either stupid or lying. Kaine was governor during the Great Recession caused by GWBush.
@AmericanSniperG @timkaine @mike_pence many of those jobs Kaine helped destroy are in the poorest sw va region #coal

I like mike but those numbers are b/s
#righttowork #atwill employer protection at worker expense. It's not quality job growth.
#RookieLeagueLackOfContext
OUCH - on top of the lowest labor participation rate.
For two different time periods, @realDonaldTrump #bigleaguelie. @timkaine kept his under national average. @mike_pence over.
We aren't voting solely on VP
THE CLINTON AND KAINE TEAM IS A GREEDY TWOSOME. CAN NOT BELIEVE A GUY LIKE KAINE WOULD BACK HER
Pence's state is anti gay and is in NRA pocket
Another LIE check the factual records , you don't speak truth! People of IN say different!
benefits from the @POTUS recovery. 
@timkaine  was Guv during @GeorgeHWBush 's Great Recession of 2007-8
b/c Tim Kaine inherited Bush's economy and Pence inherited Obama's...
Pence benefited from Obama Admin reducing unemployment rate. Thanks DontheCon you finally got itright
except that kaine was gov during gr8 recession & pence became gov when econ was turning around #ThanksObama #BigLeagueTruth
Kaine during Great Recession made by Republicans, Pence while Obama administration having fixed ecomy
Isn't #Pence running for VP because the folks in Indiana made it clear that he couldn't win? #FAIL
Must be all the nurses Indiana needed to hire for all the HIV victims Pence's policies induced.
notice how Mike deflect mud, Trump needs 2 learn this VERY WELL 4 next debate, we know u can master, kick butt
Great debate VP Mike Pence. 2016+ Tim Kanie is beyond repair/ America proud  󾓦    
another reason NOT to vote f that crooked team!
#Trumpsaloser
you can't hid behind @mike_pence 's success to cover your failures. Poor Mike can't defend your ignorance although he tried
And which President helped create the economy to help Pence: Obama!
@gabriel_turpin @timkaine @mike_pence REAL TALK....
Very misleading! One was governor during the recession and one during the recovery. (Thx Obama)
& you Trump you genius lost a billion $$ in one year.
- Splitting hairs in the attempt to make an invalid point shows your extreme desperation.
#businessLOSER
these facts will be why you win and HRC will not. I appreciate the faith as it is a Real concern.
Applesand oranges...they were governor during different economic times. Pence is anti education.
And refused to raise minimum wage
YEAH WHO HELP HIM OBAMA
can't trust your stats. You pull them out of your ass.

Kaine is just another lying corrupt POS, would know the truth if it was hanging of his nose
who's running for pres you or Pence? Dolt
Kaine was Gov. during 2008 banking crisis Pence during slow and steady recovery Indiana lag behind nation
THE FIRST DEBATE
#grannynanabe  #trumptrain
lies

And you sent all Your business overseas ! Leadership? No taxes from the rich? Wow!
@BigBluetn65 @timkaine @mike_pence https://www.conservativeoutfitters.com/blogs/news/new-leak-clinton-foundation-hacked …
thought you just tweeted no more lies.that was quick.
Look at the fact check for this.  Kaine's record much better.  #StrongerTogether
MORE LIES BY THE ORANGE LOSER
yet you caused many in us to be unemployed in us while growing jobs overseas..#trumpdumbasapost
do you know what state your running mate is gov of?  He's a failure
Kane isn't running for president.
great job Mike Pence, wake up America, we need change, our country needs a non corrupt CEO
Pence numbers bigly helped by Obama stimulus. Kaine numbers hurt by Bush recession. Bigly. #truth
Release your taxes and then we might get some real Big League Truth out of you!
@mimi_saulino @timkaine @mike_pence  honestly long as they push union wages companies won't come back. Cheaper to pay fine
Those darn things called FACTS http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/kaine-vs-pence-on-unemployment/ …  @realDonaldTrump @timkaine @mike_pence
yeah,  because everyone moved when he got elected
out of context post, unemployment rose only because of the 08 recession, tim ran in 2006-2010 http://tinyurl.com/hepy8j7  BLS
cheated millions from his workers, contractors. And fire them when they complain.
The proof is in the numbers!
He decreased unemployment yet Indiana still has few jobs right?
Fight between @timkaine = Smartarse and @mike_pence = smart man. Think of Hillary's health !
@StephyLynnBJM @timkaine @mike_pence
Wait...could Kaine serving his term during the recession and Pence serving during the recovery be a factor?! LOL.
. Bring your jobs back from overseas and stop hiring illegal immigrants, Trump.
but that's their voter Poole, people who want to stay home living on entitlements
All the unemployed moved to Virginia to find work!
@Nascar_Tom @timkaine @mike_pence others (don't fit into the other two), pay the same.
@Nascar_Tom @timkaine @mike_pence conservative/Republicans pay less tax, because we do care.
@juniperbreeze07 A Stud vs. a Dud!
@Nascar_Tom @timkaine @mike_pence liberal/Democrats pay more in taxes. They don't mind.
@Nascar_Tom @timkaine @mike_pence I have an idea.  Let's mean test taxes.
@clanceman65 @timkaine @mike_pence typical liberal state. #VPDebates #VPDebate
maybe that's because a bunch of us had to leave the state to find employment. I know I did.
I know facts are hard for you but... http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trump-oversells-pences-record/ …
you chose a great running mate....really impressed with his performance tonight.
#Delusionaldonald
,  Donald Your Twitter insanity is never ending and just a distraction, cause you have no substance
while Pence drove lots of businesses away because he is totally homophobic and racist!
Once again u have things reversed. Pence will forever be known as "The Lying Christian".
so #Pence is underperforming BIGLY compared to your no. 1 choice, gov. #Kasich :-)
PENCE WAS PRESIDENTIAL 
TRY IT ON SUNDAY
STOP THE PETTY CRAP AND ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BOY!
Nonsense.  He was gov. of Virginia from 2006-2010 or right through the worse of the Great Recession.  Misrepresentation!
Every Arbys in Indiana is fully staffed.
Kaine is a pink-faced candy man, handing out cotton candy to everybody as long as I pay for it.
Those numbers don't lie.
Aug. 2016 unemployment rate rank: Virginia #10 at 3.9, Indiana #22 at 4.5.
wasn't Indiana the place that lost Carrier to cheap Mexican labor?
And where did that unemployment come from? Unbudgeted spending to a close Depression from GOP.
Kaine and Clinton are Ticking Time Bombs for the US population.
.@realDonaldTrump @timkaine @mike_pence Kaine is why Virginia is in financial crisis and McAuliffe is putting the last nails in the coffin!!
... #debates #VPDebate
Thank Obama, who was POTUS while Pence ran IN, whereas W sank the country during Kaine's term.
Tim Kaine saw VA surge w illegal immigrants & didn't care.
Completely different economic eras. @realDonaldTrump @timkaine @mike_pence
Why didn't Pence give those stats? He should have memorized more stuff. Love you though!
different Kain had national catastrophe & Pence had the blessings of Obama saving the auto industry
Apple and oranges. Kaine was VA Gov during Bush fin collapse. Pence was INGov during Obama recovery.
