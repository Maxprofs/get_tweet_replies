Pipe down puppy. The Alt-Right, no matter how "young", is dying.  A minority in and of itself. Sad!
what is truly sad is the progressive dems turning us into a third world country!
Awwww, another Russian Twitter bot.  How adorable.
funny you use Russia. Dems say the election isn't rigged then they accuse Putin of rigging the election!
I'm just pointing out how much you act like a Russian Twitter bot, false patriot.
sorry but a false patriot would be voting for Hillary!
@realDonaldTrump you're welcome
that's barely positive
compared to Reagan or Trump?
I wasn't making a comparison at all, I was simply stating the fact that it is barely positive
I'd focus on on the "positives".
the fact you're still completely overthinking my tweet is funny to me
even funnier is if you read the thread, you'd see other "that's barely positive" replies.
maybe you should go back and reread it yourself then
Obama is not the first black president,he's the first black mulatto president!

I live in Michigan and in 2008 Obama and Hillary made my company move to Mexico   Thanks I lost job and home
What is wrong with making things in Mexico?
This is why Trump wants jobs to stay in USA! Think about it Dim Wit!
@Lucky5713 obc was designed for immigrants refugees and Muslim overlords.not the American ppl
@realDonaldTrump Obama has no real fucking say in anything. Everyone always blames the person who ends up becoming president.
the government controls the president more than anything
@GrrrGraphics. And no cost of living increase in wages
@realDonaldTrump nothing to do with OBAMA. You all are willfully ignorant
Obamacare didn't do that. Greedy Big Insurance did that.
@realDonaldTrump Less than 5% increase per year.  Sounds pretty great to me considering the increased number of people insured.
I think you mean "Thanks, insurance companies."
@realDonaldTrump do you have any idea what you are talking about at any time?
@realDonaldTrump u 4got to mention unemployment is  by over 50%. Also, no good house & Senate has blocked most of his policies
@realDonaldTrump How much do Trump companies cover for their employees?
@fitsnews Premiums have always regularly increased. People didn't pay attention until Republicans and employers told them too.
.@Kayetim0312 didn't @POTUS say my rates were going to go down though? and that I could keep my doctor?
Shop around. People I know who have taken advantage of ACA have found great insurance for much less.
Before the ACA I had to create an LLC just to purchase maternity coverage.  Totally unavailable w/o group cvg.
Hi, I'm a Guardian US reporter writing about pre-ACA maternity care. Would you be willing to speak w me? I'm at molly.redden@theguardian.com
@realDonaldTrump My employer only pays 8k for mine!
What are YOU complaining about. You can afford it with all the money you saved by not paying employees. @CNBCnow
@realDonaldTrump people at 1 point were using ers as prm health because they couldn't be denied. You have no clue about anything
@realDonaldTrump now obama is tweetin on official team trump handle too? #controlissues #ThanksObama #grammarishard
Yup. Everyone contributed a little more so 20 Million of their fellow Americans aren't executed by Big Insurance
@realDonaldTrump I'll make them for you. Pay for them with taxes.
"thanks, Obama"
But you could keep your doctor... Or some other bullshit...
@realDonaldTrump stfuuuuuuu
Shouldn't mention that's more for less due to Obama's Cadillac tax...
@Laneybaby004 there is no way our kids can give their kids the life we had.They can't save, every dime is paid out.Govt takes all
@ERepublicans
Thats because they had to add children up to age 26, makes #'s look like more people are covered. Just a # trick
TRUMP  OBAMA TOOK OFFICE WE WERE FACING.A $ DEPRESSION
OBAMA GENTLY SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED DEPRESSION SAVED USA!!
@realDonaldTrump Do your research.  Premiums rise. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_costs_in_the_United_States …
@realDonaldTrump you didn't help

@realDonaldTrump thanks Obama 4 lowering unemployment, health coverage til my r 26, stable  market, rise in stock market. 
8 years ago a bottle of coke didn't cost $3.90 either
@realDonaldTrump WRONG
@realDonaldTrump you're welcome
@realDonaldTrump the whole idea of that deal was to let the insurance companies get their federally endorsed piece of the action.
I am a benefits admin,and are those annual rates? as of today, mine run $7800-$14,400 per year, depending on how many on plan.
@realDonaldTrump lie my dropped $3600/yr
Thank big pharma, the insurance companies, and caving on single-payer. You're a RWNJ #Tool.
@realDonaldTrump when PresObama took office we were on the verge of a depression. U owe what's left of ur empire 2 him & r tax $$
.@TeamTrump Wow crazy, it's almost as if average salaries are going up by the same amount! Thanks @BarackObama
When Obama took office in 2009 employer-provided premiums cost $13,375. Today they are $18,142. Thanks, Obama.
@realDonaldTrump check out Hillary's America
@realDonaldTrump 
...but wages are higher than ever
@realDonaldTrump Trump for the people!
@realDonaldTrump how does that compare with the normal inflation on health care costs since 2008?
@ViciTrue When he took over, I saw $250, $500 and $1000 deductibles. Now $3000, $6000, 9000. PPO's actualy HMO provdr lists. #ACA
extortion $ by Russia ,Putin !! that is why HRC says always the hacks are from Russia!! the emails have juicy INFO from HRC
NC is where I live.  No health care.  Voted early, Trump was my choice.  Straight Repub. No Demo's in the WH Make Amer Gr8 Again!
@gcamp4 Obamacare is a disaster! And Bill Clinton is a rapist.
.If you get private health the gov't wont allow two insurances..,how crazy is that
@realDonaldTrump
Actually its thx Nancy DeParle's SPECIAL INTEREST Dog n' Pony Stick n' Carrot, READ ACA I did, ask WHO drafted?

@realDonaldTrump And you was walking in on naked teen aged beauty contestants and hanging out with Jeffery Epstein
@realDonaldTrump Yep, that's why my employer had to pass part of the cost to me. Thanks Obama
@DebraWi18278424 pay taxes and get single payer then you don't pay twice duh ?????
When Obama took office in 2009 my wife had no deductible on her health insurance policy. Now it is about $7,000.
@Duxgirl27 I can remedy this. You HAVE the pitch & #s. We are live in 20 countries. Access, Affordability, Accountability #Hireme
@realDonaldTrump worthless tweet without any links to sources.
@realDonaldTrump You're saying that premiums went up 7% a year. They used to go up 30%. That's awesome!! Obamacare is great!
I had to come out of retirement and find a job that had health care insurance benefits because it was our biggest expense.
Trump wins....
@realDonaldTrump #liar #dpindoc #idjut
@realDonaldTrump ...my company threatened to drop our insurance #IHateObamaCare
total failure, obummer.
@realDonaldTrump He didn't increase it insurance companies did!! They claim folks insured are sicker cost more so cost must go up
avg Sal also I creased from 41k to 49k an approx 20%. Hc costs u creased 30% on avg, so sal on increased 10%
#ObamaLoser #ObamaTreason #ObamaFRAUD
@realDonaldTrump Thanks Socialist Barry Soetoro!   JERK
Remember all the excitement for HOPE AND CHANGE ?? LOL.   8 years of Blamo total disaster for all Americans
@realDonaldTrump Obamacare doesn't work because Socialism has never worked throughout history. Next they will try Single Payer!
More proven corruption by the DNC and #CrookedHillary. Disgusting. #NeverHillary #CorruptDNC #PayToPlay  https://www.yahoo.com/news/take-the-money-and-other-highlights-from-the-podesta-email-leak-194356162.html …
That would be the insurance companies raising your premium not Obamacare. Go back to school.
.@TeamTrump 
WORST President EVER & Now He's Trying to COVER UP the #DNC CORRUPTION by Picking a Fight with Russia! 

Going to get us Killed
Trump;"I'm with U"
Its what he told Investors too  
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump
.@TeamTrump Context, from same report: Those premiums about $3,500 lower than would be if premium inflation continued at pre-Obamacare rate.
can't wait for you to get sworn in and tell him he's fired!!!!! Lol
thanks Obama and Hillary making it so I can't afford deductibles working 50 to 60 HR weeks.
@realDonaldTrump why are politicians not blaming the real culprits like the insurance companies
obummer has done nothing for me
@realDonaldTrump So your point is?
What a family photo without a dead endangered species around your neck?
We are a fatter and older population now, costs will rise.
curious... what were they in 2013, the year before obamacare kicked in?
@realDonaldTrump In NJ, 2008, our premium was $975/month.  Obamacare premiums increased to over $2,800/month. RIDICULOUS!
@realDonaldTrump
Yet another useless fact, if fact at all. As though @POTUS, & not @GOP, insurance execs set policy.#Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump it's inflation stupid just like increasing food, gas , utility costs, your so called fact is misleading
- No worse than the 8 years prior to 2009.

http://kff.org/interactive/premiums-and-worker-contributions/ …
you should look at the total picture on health insurance cost than parchments. Dont take a number and run.
@realDonaldTrump No, Donald. Thanks, insurance companies.
@realDonaldTrump crooked insurance companies only looking out for their shareholders!
Mostly because there are more people working.
@realDonaldTrump what would they have been without the ACA? You don't even know, do you? #clueless
@realDonaldTrump pay your taxes
#Obama, #Hillary, #FBI, #StateDept
Are too incompetent to figure out who sent &how to stop WIKILEAKS.Hahahahaha hahaaaaaaa.

@realDonaldTrump Your welcome!
@realDonaldTrump  Debunked
employers should be allowed to reimburse employees for health @wantmyhealthcar
true,
@realDonaldTrump  I can tell you that my private insurance through BCBS of Florida family plan premium has doubled in 3 yrs
@realDonaldTrump everything has costed more since 2009 -__-
@realDonaldTrump and when Donald runs businesses it's those who he contracts with who suffer.  Your such a lying fool Donald.
it isn't his fault according to him.  The buck stops nowhere.
before Obama took office health plans were going up 15-35% every year. Looks like ACA has worked to slow it down
and you forgot they are now mandatory, unless your boss cut your hours to part time employee. So also lost wages to employees
@ladybella1111 So true this past year I've paid every cent out of pocket due to higher deducts basically catastrophic insurance.
@realDonaldTrump thanks greedy insurance companies you mean...o no we have to insure sick people let's stick it to our insured
@realDonaldTrump wrong.
Thanks Obama Bin Laden
@realDonaldTrump it's big business raising the costs, not Hillary
@realDonaldTrump pay your taxes
thats over 26% increase is 7 years or so! How many peoples wages have increased that much?  We all know the answer!
VOTE TRUMP
@realDonaldTrump 
U should compare Hillarys tax plan with Greece when they taxed the rich and the rich moved out of the country
my server doesn't respond when I log into twitter only on my computer. I can log in any other site? R we being shut down?

http://bit.ly/2crUnI4 
 
AND DADDY SAID THIS, A FUTURE POTUS?
And many companies stopped providing healthcare at all
its almost like medical inflation is out of control or something. Clearly privatization is the solution. :/
Higher premiums explain why people have to work 2-3+ jobs because employers reluctant to higher full-time staff.
What really sucks is my employer has totally passed the premium onto us over the last 5 years by the year 2019 we pay 100%
Lib's don't know how to manage time, costs & resources since they never operated nor created a business.
Nation's debt also increased!!!
If you've got to feed, house, support and insure millions of deadbeats it costs money......real folding money.
@realDonaldTrump trumpism

She is being sued for stealing "her" shoe designs, apple doesn't fall far... 
@realDonaldTrump pay taxes user!
LIAR.  Stop lying, Donald.  Please seek help for mental illness.
Which translates to less of the new one-size-fits all govt regulated health care because it can't be afforded. 2/
Forgot to mention the increased deductible, out of pocket, co-insurance &, if you've got to go out of network, balance billing 1/
@realDonaldTrump Obama: "Obamacare is like buying a starter home"? So, If u don't buy a starter home, do u get fined by the gov?!
@realDonaldTrump Has nothingto do with Obama. Please learn how heathcare WORKS.

Ivanka Trump is in many ways scarier than her crude father & brothers. She supports his hateful campaign but hides behind her smooth persona
it will be worse under   Hillary
single payer baby
@realDonaldTrump and because insurance rates go up every year they always have
@realDonaldTrump that's about a 3.5% annual increase.  In keeping with health care cost increases not Obamacare effects. Math man
@realDonaldTrump show bill' s speech on obamacare. The americans will understand what u are saying. WIN
@realDonaldTrump ummm no, Thanks @GOP for blockading the single payer option and allowing greedy insurance to run unchecked.

@realDonaldTrump Yep, just received my notice I have to find another plan!! BCBS will no longer offer my current plan.
MY meds went up X10, My Premiums increases got me nothing, they are in a DC pocket.
And everybody is so shocked by this news

@realDonaldTrump thanks Bush
@realDonaldTrump yeh thanks Obama for making gains and having the republicans give big PHARMA and insurances control of the plan
@realDonaldTrump No...thanks 4-Profit health insurance CEO's/shareholders! Profit over people! A sick use of caplitalism imo.
@realDonaldTrump that's less than 5% growth per year.  Even assuming the numbers are true.
@realDonaldTrump What are you gonna do to fix this? Cut taxes on the rich? Like that's gonna work... Been there, done that!
@realDonaldTrump um I would rather my employer pay more than me, duh! Giess you wouldn't know that being up in your tower.
