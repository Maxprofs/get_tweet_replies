So I shouldn't buy Trump clothing and ties?
If your family is so big on buying and 
made in America why does your daughter need a new trademark with China? It's not hypocritical?
YEAH President Trump.  We are so lucky to have you!  Sorry about the lost respect that the genera; public does not have!
Amazing president 
@MTrofast

Hey Trump - show your TAX RETURNS... we'd like to ensure YOU TOO are buying and hiring AMERICANS with your BUSINESSes you continue to HOLD.
Hypocrite!!!

Take the lead on that. Will you Don  T
mr trump, what can you do about all of the illigals aliens taking office jobs????? Can something be done?
Then how will your MAGA crew purchase you and your daughters #MadeInChina goods?
U.S.A.
Any plans to open a factory in America to produce MAGA hats for the campaign?
But it might not matter because Amazon has branched into automated apparel production $AMZN
Amazon has patented an automated on-demand clothing factory https://qz.com/963381 

Starting with you? No? Weird.

What a hypocrite! Maybe you should stop importing products from China before doing a "Buy American" campaign!  #Asshole #TrumpsterFire
You should have a conversation with yourself about #buyamericanhireamerican
Uh, obama tried ending tax breaks for companies that outsource overseas... republicans blocked it
What the hell are you talking about Trump, you're so cheap you even outsource your hookers.
God! I can't wait for you to get impeached
hope you enjoy your very frustrating 8 year wait #MAGA
You talk on behalf of les than a quarter of the US population, Putin and the far right's in Europe.  I'm talking for the rest of the world.
I speak for the portion that cares about America First..the rest of the world comes 2nd to that. The continued talk about Putin is hilarious
You don't hire or make American.

Wow what a creative and relevant reply.
Yes you should discuss that with your one follower. 0111001101110101011000110110101100100000011010010111010000100000011000100110111101110100

Beautiful Sir! Thank you for standing strong for our nation! Try to ignore the haters. They are ignorant. We must not allow evil to prevail!

Ivanka needs to hire American workers to make her clothing line!  You need to hire American for Mar-a-lago.
But many of your products are made by foreign workers, and you import foreign workers for Mar-a-Lago. Hypocrite!
After you, Donald.  After you.
Show us your taxes NOW

Bill de Blasio thinks it's okay to protect illegal alien drunk drivers, putting every citizen at risk
