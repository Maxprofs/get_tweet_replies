Mr. Trump, take HRC to the very edge with all her treasonous activities. Bring her to a complete breakdown.
Call Congress at 1-202-225-3121 & demand they stop Obama! STOP Obama Before He Gives Away Internet
You'll make a great President ...... of North Carolina.
But what about the attendee that hit someone in the face?
Very possible. Wasn't there so I didn't want to say for sure!
so a supporter punched a random guy?
I'm not surprised a trump supporter hit a women

No Trump wont lose and if you dont believe me watch and see

@chosen316 I do indeed believe in this effort 2 restore what we used 2 stand 4,what we believe in. We've been dirty 2 long
Please, please, no tweets! You CAN be the man who threw away his chance of losing the presidential due to TWEETS!! So sad.
Mr. Trump as a retired Army Chaplain please remain with conviction on Veterans and our desire to be respected.
