My @POTUS and @FLOTUS 

That's ok...they are probably talking about the latest fashion and past love affairs....Obama still cries at night about Larry Sinclair. Michelle had him killed because she couldn't please him like ol' Larry.....
You need a very expensive therapist
Hi, Donald. This is Jesus Christ.

You're just an awful human being. And all of us in Heaven are glad we'll never meet you.

Anyway, have a good one. Try not to further endanger the world because you must overcompensate for small things.

BTW, Barack is our favorite in Heaven.
Thank You Jesus

WE NEED ALL REPUBLICANS IN OFFICE!! DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME UTTERLY UNAMERICAN.
Allow me to shout back, as you started shouting:
WHO TIES YOUR SHOELACES AS YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY DUMB AS F**CK?
AMERICA USED TO BE AN EXAMPLE. GOP HAS MADE IT AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT *not* TO DO!
The blue wave will end up being a RED TSUNAMI! #MAGA
Even with Democrats obstructing every aspect of our government, the Trump administration is making HUGE gains for AMERICAN citizens!
Why is the media trying to censor this video?
It’s not news worthy

Name one Trump policy that is pro-Putin.
Failure to enforce Russian sanctions for one! Failing to protect our voting system is another. Causing chaos.
Who was in charge when Russia determined our election winner?
Can you discuss anything without using the but Obama but Hillary card? Thought not!
It's their only argument
Russia is in bed with Iran.
Why would Putin want a Republican when Democrats just gave Iran everything Russia and Obama wanted OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF REPUBLICANS.

Iran Deal:
Russia voted YES 
Dems voted YES
Hillary voted YES

Trump voted WORST DEAL EVER.

Putin wants Trump??
Knucklehead when did Russia " vote yes"?
Awesome

America is and always was great. Bring jobs to America.
Haha. Lol. He must be on your payroll!

Whoever the hell he is.  I have no idea.  Question:  Is it weird I named my son after my alter ego or really cool?  Sigh.  Don't answer.
He must be corrupt too. Watch out O-Hi.
No he will be unemployed 
#BlueWave
I just realized you’re not endorsing people in places like your home New York because you know republicans will lose there (sad to know your home state hates you). You’re only backing them in places they’re already favored. Make you feel like you helped but you’re wrong.
New York is full of low IQ #LibTards, you shouldn't be bragging about that.
Oh oh @JimRenacci you just got the kiss of death.
He’s sure to lose now!
He done

Keep ensuring that Democrats win.
Well, THAT'S the kiss of death!
Jim Renacci will get my vote and my husband's vote. We had the pleasure of hearing him speak. He is dynamic.  Love that he has real life business experience & not just a politician.
He won’t even have townhall meetings for his current position that he sucks at.
How is someone from Ohio tough on the border? Ohio's border with Indiana?

 YOUR FULL ENDORSEMENT WILL HELP THE DEMOCRATS TO WIN!!! 
Everything trump touches dies
Voters don’t forget, trump also put his name behind: 

trump: 
Airlines 
Shuttle 
Steaks
Taj Mahal
University 
Magazine 
Mortgage
Beverages 
Travel 
Communications 

All failed miserably. So vote carefully! And please #VoteHimOut
No.

Is infrastructure week over?  How did that work out for Ohio?  Getting the infrastructure support and strategy from @POTUS ?  Failure.

Nah.
LardAss in Chief: Your endorsement is the kiss of death.
Wait.. did you just give him your endorsement? That's usually the kiss of death, thanks. Sherrod Brown must win.#VoteBlue #BlueWave #bluetasumi

#VoteRed2018
So you delete a tweet because of a double space, but keep your misspelled tweets??? What the f**k is wrong with you????
Keep giving "full endorsements" to Republican candidates.  It's helping make America blue again.
How come you have not responded about the events that happened in Antioch TN and the brave young man that saved many lives?  I guess they don’t matter to you!
Tax reductions for the elite and Corporations? I got a crumb of 30 bucks a month. No thanks.
I lost 25 bucks a week. I don't think Trump understands how a tax break is supposed to work.
That sucks. I'm sorry.
Now drop the mic!

Look at Trump pleading for votes. He knows the #BlueWave is coming.
oh yea he is, #BlueWave bye bye to republicams

I see LeansDem #VoteRed  #ThursdayThoughts #OH  #OHIO #Organize #USA                     #Fight4ourFreedom  #MAGA #OHVote @JimRenacci  
As if I needed another reason to not vote for Renacci...
DO YOU REMEMBER @realDonaldTrump saying he would RELEASE HIS TAXES
If elected president?
Under AUDIT?
How much did THE TRUMPS GAIN FROM THE TAX CUTS?
We already KNOW he's a liar; I'd much rather see his TAX RETURNS... which will show how deeply indebted to Russia he is. 
dripping with pee
again, the kiss of death for renacci. which is not a bad thing, coming from someone who lives in ohio. so long, renacci. 2018 #shitholepresident!
Those endorsements haven’t been working out too well bro. #ImpeachTrump


Very true...
You might need him, but Ohio doesn't. He's as crooked as an Ohio winter is long.

Well that's the end of Jim. Lol
Well #spanky I'm glad you chimed in.  He will now lose like all the others you endorsed. Thank you.

Happy to vote Renacci OUT!!
You need a miracle if you think you can remain in the Oval Office. You will need a few miracles after #MuellerIsComingForYou and #CohenFlipped go back to New York; oh that’s right they hate you too. #TrumpIsAnEmbarrassment
And another one bites the dust. Keep up the endorsements!
Please FIRE JEFF " ELMER FUDD " SESSIONS SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PROMISES WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING THE SWAMP ? ..WE VOTED FOR A WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER NOT A WALL OF PROTECTION BUILT AROUND THE DEMOCRAT SWAMP AS SESSIONS HAS DONE
Welp, there goes your chances, Jim #TrumpKissOfDeath
Who cares what you need; why should we treat you differently than how you treat others...
America will only be great again when you are no longer president!
Renacci- My distaste for Washington’s political establishment is as fervent as ever, so is my commitment to advancing the President’s agenda for a stronger & more prosperous America," Renacci said announcing his Senate bid & I’ve agreed to answer the call to service”.
Rep. Jim Renacci is the poster boy of Washington Republicans who’ve spent their time in office betraying middle-class workers to make life easier on the wealthy and well-connected," Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Jake Strassberger said. 
Trump’s choices are BIGLY ignorant!
Once you're gone it will be great again. Just like it was before you got there.

When you Randomly Capitalize certain words it Becomes Clear that you don’t understand how the English Language Works.
Renacci is a crook, just like you, and will be not win.
Can I get an edit function here?
I’m looking forward to more of your toxic endorsements.
Come on Ohioans, trump supports Renacci; therefore, you have to show up to the polls to ensure trump’s sycophant is replaced!
Thank you so much
Ohhh. Now He is done. ...
@jimrenacci is a lowlife loser just like Trump. "I need Jim very badly". We can read between those lines. Enjoy your kiss of death, Jim! "The border!" "Crime!" "MAGA!" "Our agenda!" "Immigration!" Shit buzzwords that mean nothing for a thousand, Alex.
And another one is going to lose. Keep endorsing them. That blue wave is going to drown you this fall
In that case, my fellow Ohioans, do not vote for Jim Renacci. Anyone the Liar-in-Chief endorses is in no way good for the State of Ohio!!
Jinx!!
I didn't vote for hm before, & sure ss heck won't vote for him this time either.
#ICYMI - today is the day that many people expect Michael Cohen to flip.

It’s true.



#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
#FUNFACT!…
And there we have it- a guaranteed loss for Renacci!
“Very badly”? Seriously, where’s your grammar man! By the way, your losing streak in endorsing Strange, Moore and Saccone might not work in Renacci’s race. Keep endorsing candidates! #VoteBlue
By by Jim... 
Birds of a Feather
Seems Jim has had the same problem with the TRUTH you have ... Jim Renacci says a government investigation targeted contributions to election foe Betty Sutton http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jun/22/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-government-investigation-targeted/ … via @PolitiFactOhio
Poor Jim. Now doomed.

America is a continent, so make México, Canada, Brasil, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Perú, etc. great again or change your stupid slogan.
So how are your taxes coming along? The 2015, 2016 or 2017 ones. 
It might actually be helpful that #Mueller and the #FBI has all of your paperwork now
He can do your taxes for you!
Your effort to discredit Mueller, who is an honorable man will not stop him from getting all the proof he needs to expose the fraud and all the crimes you and your cronies have committed.  Mueller is honorable, not you or Kim!
YOU helped the elite RICH and did nothing for the middle class. YOU GAVE FOR YOURSELF AND TOOK AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND FORCED THE POOR INTO A CORNER! I would say you did nothing but take from all of us! SAD ACTUALLY
Poor Jim Renacci. His stock just tanked.
Sure endorse him, this only helps Sherrod Brown lock up the win! Jim is just another T yes man that you are seeking to support your agenda. Sure he supported tax reduction for the wealthy(by the way Renacci is), just raises deficit putting Social Security and Medicare at risk.
Or as some call it, the kiss of death. 
Anyone who would accept your endorsement is an opportunistic fraud because you're an opportunistic fraud.
Go live a middle class lifestyle for a YEAR and then come back and talk to us.
PHUK YOU TRUMP
BTW Renacci had the poorest attendance record out of Ohio Reps, not sure how he was working on your behalf and it doesn't sound like he has your back. Money cannot buy what Melissa Ackison has naturally. https://AckisonforUSSenate.com 
Oh the kiss of death because of your endorsement! Ohio has a chance to be great again when Renacci loses! Thank you!
Trump logic:
A man (Kim Jong-Un) who kills his enemies and starves his own people is 'Very honorable."
But a man (Colin Kaepernick) who tries to bring light to police brutality and racial inequality is "a son of a bitch."
That’s Jim screwed then.
And he rides a Harley, loves the American worker, nothing better for the people.  My son has a gorgeous Harley, bought his wife one too, They are both great Americans, & love this United States.  No more obstructionist haters in our Congress.
@paulryan has worked hard to give wealthy permanent Tax Reductions, but he jumped ship before he was arrested for his Crime. I need vladimir very badly to help my agenda to keep MAKING RUSSIA GREAT AGAIN! He has been a fantastic president for America, and has my full endorsement!
Oops! You misspoke. I believe you meant to reference your actual motto: Trickle Down Corruption.
#kissofdeath
Two of the creepiest guys ever.
Your Administration has done absolutely nothing to #MAGA in fact you have set America back at least 100 yrs. #greatwork #MADA
Another political kiss of death from #Donnie.

Haha so much fear.
Don't impeach, pence is a religious nut.
Yes rescind tax cuts for the most wealthy
No one is taking your guns. Too bad
I'm ok with people having healthcare
We already benefit from limited socialism.
No comment!!!
Yay!!!! Fear mongering.  Last refuge of the lost
Wow! 

The WINNING Trump margin in #AZ08 of 21 points has shrunk to a measly 6 point margin for weak Lesko.

@JimRenacci better ask V. Putin for some help fast. Bigly.

By the way, margins have nothing to do with margarine.



#BuildTheWall
Yes! Just f it up for him also.  keep putting your support on these sorry ass politicians.
What a pendejo!
Another kiss of death endorsement...Democrats everywhere thank you...meanwhile #JamesShawJr #Americanhero has not been worthy of a tweet of gratitude...is it because he did what you BRAGGED of doing, going in unarmed...or....is it due to his skin tone? you racist piece of 

We have to show the country the movement still strong and we hope the good people the state of Ohio get out and vote for Jim Renacci God bless
Nope. Senator Sherrod Brown has my vote.   Besides, I wouldn't vote for anyone that you  endorse.
You know who’s really #MAGA ?  James Shaw Junior.
Your choices are questionable.  The guy in charge of Trump Tower didn't seem to too overly concerned about the tenants.  What makes you think Jim will not prioritize profits over human welfare?

#TrumpLiesMatter
Well your endorsement will likely be the end of his political career.  You’re a liability Little orange dude.  #yourenothelping #kissofdeath #FakePresident #pantsonfire #MAGA
Now I can tell you wrote this because this was written by a semi literate person. That’s you Dtrumpf.
That’s a great reason not to vote for him

fuck renacci and, more importantly, your endorsement
MAGA
Orange Curse strikes again!! 
As an Ohioan, Jim’s gone. Not only did you just give him a kiss of death but he’s a terrible politician

OHIO YOU HEAR THIS !!

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO !!
#MAGA 
VOTE @JimRenacci  
@JimRenacci is pretty much a joke in Ohio & I’m quite sure this will be @SherrodBrown ‘s largest landslide win  in his illustrious career.
what would a Great America look like.  Well, it would have the respect of the world and there would be no need for a wall.  Let's work on that.
If Jim has your endorsement he can kiss that seat goodbye. Everyone you endorse ends up losing
I'll bet a million dollars that I don't have that you know absolutely ZERO about him except for the fact he's a rethuglican.
Thank you Mr. President for working so hard to save our Country.
EVERY THING TRUMP. ENDORSES LOSES,, KEEP ENDORSING WE WILL MAKE THAT WAVE EVEN BIGGER ‘lmao. 
He doesn't have a prayer against Sherrod Brown.

Uh oh. You endorsement probably cost him up he election!
And you sure know how to pick 'em, like this guy who drinks on the job, over-prescribes medicine and creates a hostile work environment. So your endorsement really means a lot.
#DrZaibKhan: With #PresidentTrump, the world economic dynamics have shifted towards #US. Good job, Mr President!
We here in Ohio...we don't need a wall! We don't worry about illegal immigration. Tax cuts...well we didn't get those. We need good paying jobs! We need health care! We are voting blue!!!
He will NOT win Ohio! Democrats are coming! So is your impeachment!
.@JimRenacci looks like you’re going to lose since trump endorsed you. Sad.
Every time trump endorses a candidate they lose. I can't figure out who's dumber, the candidates. or trump
Time to stop the nonsense change the LAW we can’t continuously admit thousands of asylum seekers just because they come in CARAVAN’s we have 40 million undocumented people that the USA  rather the American working class is supporting !!!!! ENOUGH
#MAGASAVEUS FAST !!!!
He sucks


We voters in Ohio love Sen Sherrod Brown!  Renacci is a crook like Trump, I guess that's why he likes him.
Your endorsements are a hex on those you support.
Resist Trump incompetence, vote Democrats.
He has your " full endorsement"? Well that's his chances fucked!
You’re a stain on our Nation
Renacci obviously needs to go if you're endorsing him.
Would never vote for a tax cheat
Just make sure you let everyone know exactly when America is “great“ again in your mind. lol
Nope
and Jim’s opponent immediate loads this tweet into a cannon and broadcasts it as far and wide as possible. Your endorsement is poison now you dope. #comrade
Your endorsement pretty much guarantees he will lose, so thanks!
If Jerkin’ Jim is smart he will maintain distance from your TOXIC Ass....Remember Big Luther, Easy Ridin’ Racist Roy, & Guilty Gillespie, they ALL lost their elections WITH & B/C of your endorsement !!
Translation. I am fucked and am loosing control. Please minions, degrade yourselves to keep my tenuous grasp on power.

US banks have to increase lending rate so profits of corporates will decrease thus tax collection of usa also decrease. Fiscal deficit will increase. Its start of recession near future. Need to apply Economic and Employment method of gopal maheshwari to solve debt & unemployment.
Yay! You’ve endorsed another republican. This should be a shoo in for his opponent! Keep it up! #BlueWaveComing2018
Whatever! Still taking out too much in taxes for hard working Americans. Making the middle-class and poor struggle to make it. #TaxScamBill


And the last time you fully endorsed someone what happened???
Jim Renacci is a trump troll and Ohio has a GREAT Senator in Sherrod Brown

You greatly need a fucking clue.
if you need any kind of marketing you can knock me for build up and grow up your web/blog... i am expert in #SEO, #digital marketing #SMM etc.
@realDonaldTrump You just gave him your kiss of death. You don’t have friends only people who hate you less.
Thanks for pointing out another bad politician by endorsing him!
And... you just sealed his fate.

Unfortunately i haven't seen any extra money under the tax reform yet
Well Mr. Renacci, you can kiss your political career good bye.  Trump just put the kiss of death on it.
On the glorious day when God smites you I will piss on your stinking rotting corpse.

Aaaaaaaaaand... that's the end for another Repugnican!!!!!

Recession will prevent by Economic and Employment method of gopal maheshwari.
1. Indirect tax back method 
2. Employment method 
3. Interest free debt management 
4. Trade balance method  
These all method create 6 million lifetime New jobs in USA & strong purchase run business.
Economist should apply Economic and Employment method of gopal maheshwari so 6 million new lifetime jobs will created in US, these jobs are unaffected from company failure, recession & govt have not to pay salary. If 10000 $ per month gain by 6 million then economy will boom zoom

Kiss of death, Jim!
MAGA
Jim Renacci will not be good. Vote blue wave


Haha. Renacci is toast, especially since he turned Trump stooge. Now the Republicans will also lose his House seat too. GREAT MOVE, Donny!
