#REMEMBERPEARLHARBOR
choose one:
Obama vs. Trump statement on Pearl Harbor 
Do you have down syndrome? He literally linked his statement in the tweet you're replying to.
I find this neither offensive nor repulsive - YOU'VE BEEN HACKED!
May they rest in continued peace for eternity. A day that should never be forgotten and one we never allow to happen again.
yes
In Jesus name..Amen Blessing for the Family.
as all good, real Americans should give thanks to the greatest generation.
Never forget! Justice triumphed over the evil Invaders!

@susieb0807 
Too bad DJTs daddy wasn't there !!


This isn't a day to post memes of Trump. Show some class whether you like him or not.

The truth about SoftBank's investment (it's to manipulate Trump): http://progressivesforprosperity.org/the-truth-about-softbanks-investment/ … @realDonaldTrump
He is your president weather you like it or not , If not get the fuck out of our country.
weather? Another illiterate Trumptard. Are you the one banned from flying?
You lost you got your ass kicked , lick your wounds and quit crying.Change your diaper.
we ALL lost. You're just too stupid to know it.
Your to stupid , you supported a criminal a woman who sold this country out .That's what you call being stupid .
wtf do you think Trump is? How dumb can you be? Full on stupid.
it's ignorant people like you who keeps voting these same politicians back in office and wonder why things are like they are
this is a bot. That pulls donors from the campaign finance disclosure registry.
You will be impeached
What about all who will die because u took their health insurance?
My insurance plan would be over $400 without Obamacare. I pay $150. Yeah, that's affordable.
I have a job and I pay my fucking taxes, which is more than I can say for "small loan of a million $$" pay-no-taxes Trump.
Why should you have pay taxes to have subsidized healthcare? ACA never made any sense.
oh, lookie it's the Devil.

I'm overwhelmed by your hypocrisy  @realDonaldTrump
(not smth I would have done, with my five Vietnam deferments! "Heel spurs", indeed! I'm so SMART!)
Didn't Trump shaft veterans:
This is a fake.
I just pray and hope that you are for all people and not just a particular group. I believe in you just believe in yourself
glad someone took your phone away to tweet something respectful
I wonder how respectful your pics were in your "former modeling" (aka IG selfie model) days.
I had good pics in my modeling days. Sexy yet tasteful.
Oh I know you did Tony
Had you been alive in '41, you would've blamed the attack on FDR not "standing" for America.
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
Hello Glad Your there have a nice Christmas
Yes we sure did!
Okay you have to give props when someone does the right thing. I don't think Obama ever remembered Pearl Harbor, not once.

This might be from the 2011 speech. That was the only time I could find that he spoke about it.
You should have been there.
my grandfather survived pearl harbor and I voted for Trump
.@ChristineMMoran  Thereby wiping your ass with his memory.  How proud he must be!
Pakistan is the shithole of the world.
than why your president say Pakistanis are good persons? On phone talk with our PM @realDonaldTrump
What else do you call a racist anti-semite?
YOU WON PERSON OF THE YEAR! YOU CANT STOP WINNING, WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH!
Just like Hitler and Stalin "won" it.
they all won, youre right
So sad cause I see your tweets are so much better. Lmao at you.
glad you got to your self promotion first this morning. took ya long enough to get to this
Gave their lives, or lives taken?  I think it's more the latter.
they gave their lives to AMERICA
Had they left American territory, I would agree.  But they were killed before they knew a fight was coming.
Sorry Scotty! That's not how it's done here in the USA! How's the weather in Scotland? @themutante @fucknamesyo
"Scotty" you're funny!
@RoseTay87 As well as Obama!
Obama?
Was Time magazines person of the year.
oh lol you replied to a Pearl Harbor post. I was like wait, obama wasn't there 
people equating PEOTUS to Stalin and Hitler because he is Time mag person of the year.
Yea, I fought that all morning
In truth more democrats have won that honor than republicans.
my dad was a WW2 vet...thank you for saying this
mis respetos para todos esos hombres y mujeres gracias
God's Will is going to be done no matter what, our Hell is the non-exceptance. I have Ms and I'm happy Trump is in charge.
happy
Congrats MR Trump, @TIME Person of the year
Like Hitler and Stalin. 
like Clinton and Obama...no wait...he will actually be good for America...unlike them!
Hitler
if you want Iran China or any other dictators to back off TALK HUMAN TIGHT they are scared to death of this
AMERICA FIRST YESSS
my grandfathers both answered the call of their country, they also judged all men on the content of their character.
mine too. He would have decked Trump for calling women what he does.
truth. They had a real low tolerance for BS.
my grandfather joined the Navy after Pearl Harbor, he was in his 50s!
they're rolling in their graves now that you're president elect.
been there.  Arizona and how mad is it that the Japanese are settled there.
Without google, you'd have no freaking idea. #TrumpleThinSkin
fuck japanese
they will live in our memory forever.................
75 yrs ago when attacked, no one in Govt argued on what to call an enemy..we just killed them
More like this mature, noble tweet, please. This is the stuff we should be seeing.
No draft dodgers there, Mr. President.
HE WONT a STOP LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
transgender training for military is disgraceful
My dad was there.Pic taken days before the attack.He taught me what it meant 2 B a Patriot. picked up weapons & fought back
please..dont act like you care.
My Grandfather, Rear Admiral Elijah W. Irish, my Grandmother, my mother and aunt were all stationed at Pearl Harbor, lived!
You would never have been one of them. You used power and privalage to avoid being in conflict. 

Words are easy.
put me on your transition team
............................
do u even know where Pearl Harbor is?
Thank God for Wikipedia
what about the internment camps that followed for the Japanese, want a moment of silence for that? #fuckyou
Amen
https://corrupt.af/ 
Americans have to have a tough army & well equipped to let the world know we are peaceful but we will protect our country
God bless the greatest generation that America has ever produced!!!!
Donald Trump can you bless my project!

Not your words! You compared a soldier's sacrifice to yours and didn't attend a single Veterans Day ceremony! Pfft...#GTFO #Trump
sure ...with comrades like this one...
payback was a little overdone though...
Our lost heroes did not give their lives. They were taken by surprise and murdered. Japan paid for it dearly.
and could not give four years
Draft-Dodger.
It took 10 Muslims to take more live at 9/11 than all the men & firepower at Pearl Harbor. Stop importing them. #TrumpTrain
these heros were PRE9/11 so those who lived would not qualify for the Caregiver Benefit.
Only POST9/11 are deemed in need.
Pearl Harbor vets. Must be stunned at what has become of our country. They didn't  give their lives to have Russia
...says the draft dodging son of a draft dodger.

Thank you for taking on the challenge of rebuilding the greatness of America!  You could have just rested, God bless you!
For their sakes the fight 4justice must always go on.
Have you ever been to one of our Memorials? Probably not.
Yep. Let's pause. Unlike you, none of those precious souls dodged the draft. #disgusting

2/2 United Statessoldiers 16,112,566KIA 291,557Wounded 670,846Cilvilan deaths 6,000. I wish the USA would wake up.
If the Flag is burned---should be an automatic 5 years enforced hard labor camp!
You are a good man?你们是好人？あなた達は良い人ですか？Sie sind die Guten?Ты хороший человек?Vous êtes quelqu'un de bien?너희들 좋은 사람이야?
#andwherewereyou#nopresidentelecthere
I will also pause & wonder how you know anything about the military as you have never served!
CAN'T DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO BASIC NECESSITIES IN BISMARK!!!!!!! AND NOT REFUNDING PEOPLE'S MONEY AFTER THEY PAID A WEEK!
My 96 year old WWII vet father (Battle of Bulge) thinks that you're an embarrassment to the country & values he fought for.
You know nothing of sacrifice or heroism
Well said!  Spoken like a true Vet.  But wait, you never served.
You who dodged the draft have nerve!
Articulate, thoughtful, sans caps and exclamation points... When you know it was staff who wrote your tweet...
they did not give their lives. They were taken.
Alan Mulally new pick but excellent choice so Rudy,J.Bolton anybody but the loser Romney. Pray about Mr. President. Big Hug
They died serving the country, and you didn't because of bone spurs hahaha
bigly boss we love how you tell it like it is! What a gift!
@ouchinagirl ... my God, what a great PRESIDENT already!!!!! I truly have hope and joy again!

On this day lets recall we have a common history..  out of respect for those who defended us.. silence & peace and be WE.
I guess they didn't have bone spurs to hinder their giving.
.                     Please stop Verizon from sending thousands of jobs to India.  We lost 28,000 American jobs 
So glad you won Mr. Trump :)
good job reflecting on Pearl Harbor. How's your ankle?
TRUMP I bet you would INSULT THEIR PARENTS IF THEY WERE DEMOCRATS & ANGERED YOU! REMEMBER YOU DID THAT? AMERICA REMEMBERS!
They didnt give up their lives willingly they were attacked some in bed never got to wake up Do you know any of history?
great choice for sec of state. Rex Tillerson. Perfect. Thank you
American History should be mandatory from grade one through four years of college  millennials know no American history
These were real men and women at a very young ageGod bless them everyone 
Like you give a shit about any veterans, you are making a fool of this country. We will go downhill fast.
should have been you!! Draft dodger!!!
Now they are heroes? Before they were losers. We are on to your bull, and I, for one, am not letting you off the hook.
this from a coward who couldn't serve but loves war!! LOSER!!
Amazing!! You can take a minute to think of something other than your narcissistic self!!
thank You.
Inculto: nadie dio su vida; fueron masacrados por un gobierno tan fascista como tú.
full draft dodger
Just mailed Pearl Harbor 75 Aniv to 4 folks. I was age 21 back then. Age 24 when out after ww2. back Korean war 5 yrs. A95
my dad taught me even if you don't respect the man you must respect the uniform. Please stop the tweeting and lead the USA.
beef producers need meat labeling
While I'm kind of convinced someone just took his phone, this is actually better than @newtgingrich.
That hurt to say... XP
"What did you do in the (Vietnam) war, daddy?"
can you pause and do something about @mflynnJR ? How long will you let him escape justice for what he did to Susan?
China's yunnan province government established FanYa. For five years. $6.5 billion fraud people http://dlvr.it/MYNL3g 
fue el peor error de Japón despertó el oso blanco neutral
you make it sound like it was their choice... it was a sneak attack, or did you not pass history?

they were not draft dodgers!
who typed this for you? I know it wasn't you

Oh that's rich. You compared the loss of a military hero to you working late at the office. We remember that jackass.
The big man with the will.
#talkischeap#whyareyounothere#TooReal4U##GrabYoirOwnPussy
U should remember and honor them.  They were brave patriots who answered the call to protect us.  You didn't.  #draftdodger
To protect draft dodgers like you
#newsreelssoiguessithappened
You could attack again the Japan  ...
Well stated.
After Pearl Harbor, we profiled the Japanese. You ran a campaign on profiling Muslims and Hispanics. You have no right.
all so that fascism could be welcomed to America by a reality show hack
they must have told you today was special and not becuz you got your mug on time.
i like heroes who don't get killed.
My family lost three members. One fought in D-day invasion. Mr Trump, I fear you do not the values that they fought for.
And none of them had a draft deferment for heel spurs or sexually transmitted diseases!
amen!!! God bless them all!!
Mr PET, don't make the same mistake FDR made with the Secretary of State made who was incompetent to realize Japans threat
Mr T, continue to thank folks, unite folks and remember our fallen heroes !
