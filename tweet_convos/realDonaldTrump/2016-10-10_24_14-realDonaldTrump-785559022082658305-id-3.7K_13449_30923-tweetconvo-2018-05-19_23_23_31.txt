Fox News is bias, should we have them doing the debates?

MSNBC is the WORST!  CNN is 2nd WORST!!!!!!
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN Trump is a Mad Dog. He's attacking everyone including the kitchen sink.
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN The media is so obvious on being against Trump..#sickening
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN I have to say NBC is right there with them. Both biased and irrelevant
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN Biased? Or... do the voters just not like misogynistic rapists?

I've stopped watching cnn since I find out they are bias. TRUMP!
Any proof? If not, maybe you can add one more lawsuit for defamation to your list.
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN Central park 5
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN That's why it's known as Clinton News Network.
If you can weather all those against you, you can weather anything that would hit America! You are the best!
cause they don't bow to u? u get mad at anything u attack them. That's not what America or politics or life is about
as far as I'm concerned, CNN is not a real newsroom!! They work for one side! Guess which one?
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN Media in bed with Clintons. Nasty
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN ya blame @CNN for YOUR continuous DESPICABLE comments/actions smh
Why is Trump left out of the ? ahead of time and not allowed  the earbud like HC? Maybe candidates sh/b frisked b4 debate!!
Anderson and Martha were totally biased. And Martha should not have tried to debate you on foreign policy!
So SAD.  Everyone should dump cable new and listen to http://TRUNEWS.com .
At least they know YOU are watching and you take the bait everytime.  Weak mind.
Typical Clinton supporters who have to be told what to think and say at all times least they say something Patriotic.
Unlike Fox News which we know to be balanced and fair. Man I'd hate to see you on drugs
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN not nearly as biased as yu Trump!!!!
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN CNN = ClintonNewsNetwork
@DanScavino @wolfblitzer @DanaBashCNN @JohnKingCNN not as bad as fox or msnbc
