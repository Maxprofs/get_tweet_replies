Way to go Mr. Trump!
good afternoon Mr president I'm Anss from Syria and I'm 21 I was study at Florida and I'm commercial pilot
High premiums in key swing states.
you obviously do not know about pa Commonwealth system
you should show your birth cert trump I think you are an alien !
America is very excited that Hillary is going to be the next President. I know your heart is exploding but she is the best
Is "disaster" the only word you know?
DISASTER EMERGENCY DECLARED! #MAGA
50% or more in Arizona.. Companies leaving
you are a laughing stock  Mr trump !
I don't use exchange, but if I did, it would be over 20% of my gross salary.  How is that affordable?
over 100% in Az! Disgusted! @KellyannePolls
One of your youngest deplorables is sending you best wishes tonight! #closethedeal #TrumpPence16
replaced with what? You don't offer any solutions!
all I hear is crying and whining.
you can't have Megan Kelly she's to smart for you! Only dummys !
What? By your plan that cuts everything? No plan means no care. Eligibility matters. Not all of us were born with a silver spoon
I be ashamed to travel and telling people I am American !
you are right the election is rigged !
Hillery corrupt ? Ok but she's not mad crazy like you !
With what Donald, with what? Repeal ACA and your back to square 1? 20M+ lose coverage. How exactly will you fix it?
I got a letter saying my insurance company requested a 28% premium increase! With 2 young kids, I couldn't afford Obamacare
@StikNtheMud @realDonaldTrump in my state, my insurer asked for a 26% increase but the state approved 67%! WTF?!
factor in the gvmt's. cut
before the 67% increase,monthly insurance premiums for a family of 4=$2400+deductibles
Trump in 2008: Hillary Clinton will 'go down at a minimum as a great senator'
Hillary had no accomplishments as a Senator. NONE! Just as Obama! Dems too stupid to research!
Said like a true NYer. Oh wait, that would be me, not you, and I disagree, as do most NYers.
Just proves you're easily manipulated!
Naming a post office is not much of an accomplishment.
Ask the 1st responders, kids, etc. Or Google. But cultists don't like facts so u won't right?
Hopefully youll@watch Hilary fix Obamacare from prison
I can't wait for you to repeal Obamacare.
@oisesu53 Please see the confidentialmemo on Varney&Co, aboutREDDITCLearinghouse, trying toscrew upTrumppolls etc
yes of course. #Donald trump it's SO easy to talk about flaws, but much harder to actually come up with better to replace
Not by a predator like you Donald.
#BillClintonIsARapist
you're gonna get beat by a girl #loser
You do realize, this tweet implies losing to girls makes a person inferior?  You ironically dissed Hillary.
yes and Kynect just notified my husband they are no longer in Kentucky. Ugh!
Link for former kynect clients to switch over for 2017: http://KyHealthTransition.info   Pass it on!
#Debate tip: Try not to tell HRC she "doesn't quit" after making her "lack of stamina" one of your dumb talking points. @realDonaldTrump
This is from Fox. They might be a little biased #justsayin

Lots,of Drs, won't even take Obama care.If u call for appt,they say NOT TAKING NEW PATIENTS. THATS NOT THE REAL REASON
66% increase in premiums in Tennessee.They will not have ins.,because they cant,pay those premiums.ALSO CARE GOING DOWN

@PabloLeslie @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrumpAZ But they will be the ones to bitch the loudest!!!!

Wow! Pretty much gives us a blow by blow of the truth of Obamacare.
Is Twitter just buggy? I did not get this tweet in my Home.
ya because this healthcare plan is set up to pay for the unemployed immigrants

Drop it like it's hot!
I will not be able to afford it...#UNBELIEVABLE
Obamacare replaced by what? You fail because you don't have a plan. Replaced by what Mr Trump?
Oklahomans in for sticker shock come 2017.  BCBS only provider now with a 76% increase.  According to  @kfor
MAYBE REPEAL THE US CONSTITUTION TOO!  THE FAILED EXPERIMENT BY PLUTOCRATS IS ALMOST OVER!  18TH CENTURY JUNK GOVT!

@pjweaver94 only Donald will do this!!
your lexicon is four words. Terrible. Wonderful. Beautiful. And Bigly. I wish you were kurt cobain, marble mouth.
don't lose it, brother. The finish line is near. #trumpnostress

With what, @SheilaButt4TN  U wouldn't vote for insurance for poor Tennesseans & still no alt plan offered by @TNGOP

@JJDJ1187 
Replace unaffordable Care Act

& competitive bidding 
across state lines
@TeaPartyExpress @PoliticalActOne

I totaly agree
Finally!

The premiums are outrageous all over! This is not affordable healthcare! It's extortion at its best - fleecing of America
@EricTrump we are now paying 600.00 month for healthcare. Heaven help us trump 2016

TRUMP IS GOING TO JAIL. WHOOP WHOOP!!!
@WhiteHouse wants us to believe it's our fault his plan is failing! We the People can't wait until you get elected
so fix it.when you are building something's not working,do you tear it down or fix it?
It's UnConstitutional to be forced to buy or you get fined. Caused employers to layoff and cut back full time employees
Very Sad for America
when elected as a president donald trump will teach the young generation how to grab a pus'y. #veterans #HillaryClinton
@EnoughisEnoug13   Wait til they see their deductibles too.
Donald Trump vs. the videotape at the final debate - CNN

@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump look close at his tiny feet next time you can...donald wears womens rain boots
#trumppussyhurts
a 53 yr old friend has no insurance due to cost.    She sd she will sign up only if she really needs it.
FORD dealership said it's cheaper to pay $250k penalty than it is to pay insurance for 60 employees.  Staff loses big time.
in most states the rise is the same as before
NeverTrump
@mjr5306 Ha! Ha! Ha!  Can't be denied because of pre exiting illness,  & your kids can stay on your insurance until 26.
In order for the American people to except Socialized Medicine it had to be implemented slowly a little at a time.
Obamacare was NEVER meant to succeed. It was designed to fail on purpose. Signal Payer System has always been the plan.
@We_R_Trump
Stay on this message on commercials in PA. CATHOLICS being bastardized as well .
looser
replaced with what? You've given NO DETAILS on a new healthcare system
@bittybug1 They voted for Obama last time. Hope they all suffer, get what they deserve
We in PA wouldn't be in this fix if voters hadn't elected an empty suit Dem Gov who signed us up for the unaffordable ACA.
Use this as tv add in pennsylvania.
@thrgreatfeather @terianne7201 @surfermom77 @miceemouse @rob_mcwaters hillarys answer is bailout which is no answer at all
what the hell do you know about affording health care? Shut up already you speak nonsense. You know nothing
That's nonsense. Obamacare does much more good than bad, it just needs adjusting, like you're hairdo, Mr. Banana  Hair
poor loser
how exactly are you going to do this? You are all talk no substance.
@Trump_Movement_ Agreed!!! Obamacare needs to be BANNED forever!!!!
24% increase in North Carolina! http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/karen-garloch/article108764207.html …

No! No! No! Millions of Americans now have health care and so many other benefits.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, across 17 states including Washington DC, premiums are  by an avg of 9%.
Please point out that USA does not want Kaine as a #2kaine , Pence is our number 2

Yikes. Even rats are jumping off the Trump train.
It was meant to fail! & lead to single payer.
undecided voters.when you vote Hillary vote straight dem ticket so we can have a congress that works- GOP stalled for 4 yrs
Our (Dem) MN Gov recently said up by 70% 2017, unsustainable.....
Companies are dropping out and it's unaffordable that only children are enrolled not the parents. Cheaper 2 pay fine!
