You are including jobs overseas and projected jobs. Sorry, those don't count to American people. You are so look very out of touch.
How does http://Alibaba.com  count?! They're a Chinese company! And Amazon's "jobs by 2018" is planned growth started long ago. More BS
BS
Your jobs report is worse than any since 2010. Obama beat you every year of the last 6 years of his presidency. How do you like them apples?
I LOVE MY PRESIDENT Proud & Respect The Majority Of The American People That Voted For Him 
! MAYBE SO ! BUT HE IS THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES !  !
Hey  "ToDumbToKnow"_Mike, Tike President Trump is so much wiser, cares so much more 4Americans  then BaRat Odrama. Your President dummo.
You've got to be kidding.....
Only 98,000 JOBS last mo. down 1st time in 20 mos. under Obama. More leaving as you take credit for jobs planned 2 yrs ago!
The JOBS you create in China, 11 other countries, "guest workers" exceed you bigly Sprint post!
RealDonaldTrump JOBS! JOBS! JOBS! indeed as. Your dismal job report this month was, you are creating far more job LOSES with policy, budget!

#LyingTrump...
Thanks, Obama! You have yet to set policy. You have had ZERO impact on job growth.But, you're good at taking credit for things you didn't do
So precious, Mr. President! How you take credit for things you had little or nothing to do with. Precious, my precious ...
Dont be tricked into thinking Assad used poison gas.  He didnt.   The attack ignited industrial chlorine on the ground.
Thanks Obama
Yeah, not, WAR, WAR, WAR, #AmericaFirst !
And your administration is full of straight bullshit.
Haha, yeah, these were literally nothing to do with you, buddy. Thanks President Obama!
I love how you love to take credit for someone else's achievements. If only you'd take credit for your own, like your abysmally low ratings.

Anyone who believes that alt fact needs to check if they are missing a brain

That is great news!!  Make sure to thank former President Obama for the continued job growth since 2009!
You got it Mr PRESIDENT Commander and CHIEF Donald Trump GREAT JOB!
Thanks Obama. You haven't done a damn thing. Where are all the Deplorables dreaming of working the coal mines?
The economy is a timebomb.The consumer is tapped out with high debt, high cost of living and low wages. GDP is near 0,, 20T debt, thx Obama!
Sucking up to your ass is not a job. That's called punishment
Thank you @POTUS.  You truly are making America great again!
Fake News Fake News Fake News.            They had their plans long before you even started your election plans, you don't know business.
RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA

Good one.  He could have just said deflect, distract, deny!!

No thanks to you! Hello? Are you seriously taking credit for what the Obama administration worked hard on doing?
Thanks Obama!
Now that's some funny shit! #MAGA
Jobs jobs jobs? We miss obama. You're terrifying is.
Someone seriously made a fake "immigrants for trump" account? 
Secret Service/Deep State will know exactly where to detain Trump & family when the time comes. https://nyti.ms/2oEqfky  #MAGA #TCOT #CCOT
Leave forgien policy to the experts
Those jobs had nothing to do with you. We will start seeing decrease in jobs since you are killing our tourismn
Jobs about to be lost. Tourism: airlines, hotels and restaurants. Health care :,doctors nurses support staff. Government jobs,EPA, etc.
how many lost?
We are proud you are our president.  Thanks for making America great again !
Also, you've created a ton of new jobs in the Blowing Sector every time you suck Putin's dick!
Just remember snowflake that Hillary was the one with the stupid red reset button alongside of Putin.
"I can't defend 45 so I will deflect to Hillary".. every Trumpers go to..
I'm actually not a huge fan of "45" either but he's doing a hell of a lot better than Hillary would've been. Thank God she's not POTUS
Not a huge fan, but uses terms coined by Trumpers who think they are insulting us... ... hmmm...
If the shoe fits
Lol..You have no idea that you contradicted yourself do you? Have a pleasant evening.
YES! snowflakes get hurt by mean people come to Twitter and whine. Probably don't have jobs. Probably play golf and brag all day. JOBS!
Terrible jobs report! How come no tweeting about that? Wait: is that why you bombed Syria? So no one would notice jobs #s?
THANKS OBAMA, THANKS OBAMA, THANKS OBAMA!
ROBOTS, ROBOTS, ROBOTS! 
Address the real issue! Focus on education, not human-powered manufacturing jobs!
You sound like a complete loon, no idea how anyone takes you seriously… almost all of these "deals" you post were planned under Obama lol
Also, companies may be building factories here, but how many HUMANS will work in them? Our manufacturing output has consistently INCREASED…
This is why you hate the news: "Trump Touts a Company’s Hiring Plan From 2015"
Do ya have to be such a downer.
You'd rather believe "so-called" President Trump's #FakeNews? You guys HATE the truth that Obama created all these jobs 
Nepotism News Network:
• Bannon is removed from NSC
• Ivanka gets official WH position
• Eric Trump: “We might be here because of nepotism"

another made up lie by you. Fake news!  Fake president. Most unqualified president ever!
You haven't done anything, but divided this country and make us look like idiots to the world.  #ThanksObama for the jobs!!!
I think you are the best POTUS! I wish I could come work for you. As an Art Director & Social Media Guru, I would be the one of the best.
U dummy
Obama let's see he accomplished boat loads of money to fund terrorists. Lied everyday. Never was open or up front he was too busy seeing what crooked shit he could get away with each day. Hates America! I could go on and on! There's so much. You are mental to believe otherwise!
So how many of the jobs you out source have you brought back to the US?
What this does not reveal is that so many of these jobs are part time minimum wage retail jobs.
BOMBS,BOMBS,BOMBS!
#TrumpRussiaCollusion
Put the word "Blow" in front of that and you sound just like Clinton.
Until #AI & #Robots replace humans
Chasing dated & dying industries w not make us gr8 Ur GIVING China the lead in renewable energy & all the new patents, lost, & the $$ poof
Today's job report... 98,000 jobs reported for the March! Trump.... crickets! #wherearethejobs
the crazy left and Hillary as well as Obama insane say RESIST-JOBS GROWTH-Better healthcare-self sufficiency. THEY ARE LOST

The jobs report shows a DISMAL number of jobs added since your occupation of the WH.  You have done NOTHING to add jobs you lying huckster
No war in Syria? No Systemchanges? time to unfollow the same s.. like Clinton mccain and grahams want's Swamp
BOATS, BOATS, BOATS!
Obama was adding 200,000 new jobs a month when he left. I didn't see that kind of statistics this first quarter.
where are they? 75,000 americans are losing jobs per day..liar
98,000, NOT 235,000.
Obviously, you hoped to distract from the official job report of a lackluster 98000 jobs in March. Such a liar. Sad
What jobs, what jobs and what jobs? Talk is cheap!
All this from a pathological liar. Not impressed. Let's see the fine print.
Where's the proof?
Most of these jobs were already committed before you were elected.
To bad you had nothing to do with getting any of these jobs
Many many fewer jobs were added than were expected---YOU FAIL! AGAIN.
You'll take credit for anything won't you. What will we do when automation leads to not having enough jobs for every American?
Jobs?  I dont see any jobs!
Ok
Boasting, again, about something that is not a direct result of you or your policies. When, and if, jobs grow from you all protections gone.
Mr. President...speak TO ME...not side to side...let me see your eyes...use the camera's teleprompter!!! Assurance comes from the eyes!!!
Thanks you Obama
This must be in your alternative universe. 
If you can't tell the truth how about quiet time for something different.
Where!  FRAUD!
Splat...98K jobs this last month! REALLY? BAD, REALLY BAD. Where are the jobs?
LIES! LIES! LIES! #dumptrump
Can you say THANK YOU OBAMA for saving the economy.
Did you break 90 this weekend?
Without using the foot wedge...
Flat numbers compared to Obama. Sad.
Jobs report was horrendous this month! Keep taking credit for auto industry expansions that have been planned for over 5 years! Jag- off!
Your government jobs number went back to being fake news?
What about loss of jobs Macy's, JCPennys, Microsoft, Halliburton, Pepsi, Verizon, Cisco, Oracle, Kellogg, Boeing, McDonalds, etc etc etc!!!
President Trump! Fantastic! #MAGA 
THANK YOU PRESIDENT OBAMMA FOR ALL THOSE JOBS!!!! YOU ROCK PRESIDENT OBAMMA
Most of those companies had these hiring/expansion plans before you were elected. Dumbshit!
Thank you President Obama!
What about the loss of tourism and travel to the US because dear leader is a hateful nitwit?
Haha...no that had nothing to do with you.
Dude, you are O responsible for jobs growth in last 75 days, or any of the deals you just advertised, Carrier cost $7m for 700 jobs,#joke
.@realDonaldTrump – FACTS on Feb JOB numbers: avg for prev 5  yrs=230 M. 4 of these yrs EXCEEDED your 235 K! So, yet again, THANK YOU OBAMA!
CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION
thanks trump, without your help with clean coal jobs,miners would still be struggling to find a dead end jobs.  Maga is backwards
Thank's Mr. President, finally someone cares.
Notice Fox on the bottom?
Too bad the new jobs report is quite dismal...Sad.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! https://instagram.com/p/BShtQnLgquy/   
 #IStandWithPresidentTrump 100% 
Cnn
US created only 98,000 jobs in March, vs 180,000 expected.
China creating 130 million jobs over 10yrs making Alternative energy products. Beating USA hands down on job creations & clean energy. SAD
Thanks Mr President
Idiotic
claiming credit is Fake News. Pres had nothing to do with creation of these jobs
the people in springfeild, massachusetts need jobs for the teenagers and adults thank you mr.president
#trumpsyriaattackruse #trumpsyriaattackruse #trumpsyriaattackruse #trumpsyriaattackruse #trumpsyriaattackruse #trumpsyriaattackruse
More twisted news from our fake president.
Why do you insist on taking credit for work you had nothing to do with? Embarrassing!
Don't forget none of this was you jobs numbers same without u, claiming uptick fantasy YOU are a PUTZ!
BULLSHIT! All of these projected way before you #CheetoAss #TrumpTreason

What good is it to make America rich again, if her soul is rotting and the deep state is running Washington? WE DON'T WANT YOUR CIA WARS!
Bull shit fake news
But unemployment rose before your first 100 days were up...
98,000 jobs vs. Feb's 219,000 jobs. Now that reports show reaction to you, the numbers go down. And you're bragging?!
#LIES, #LIES, #LIES!
Thank you @BarackObama!
I want to see real statistics otherwise is fake news.  Anyone can make a video with fake information. “Fox Fake news.”
Don't for a minute think you get credit for this from anyone but yourself!!
Yo, Maybe we need to put this on hold. Terrorist attacks everywhere. Please take them downnnn
How 'bout that March jobs report, eh? Funny I haven't seen a tweet from you on that. 98K. Yuge? Unbelievable? Jobs jobs jobs?
Another lie. these jobs were created under President, Barack Obama, Stop trying to take credit for his successes and look at your failures.
Look at the source! FAKE FOX NEWS
Taking credit for something that was planned years ago.  Not cool!
WHERE, WHERE , WHERE
Not your win. Stop taking credit for the results of eight years under Obama.
How were the numbers for March? Under 100,000? Down over 60% from February. How's the Russia scandal?
fyi, ALIBABA is a China company. Are you seriously bragging re: claimed job creation in China?
Maybe you should read the comments from instagram straight from the #americanpeople
Not a very good jobs report. You are a failure.
Been with POTUS since the beginning behind him all the way a president finally doing what he said he would do putting Democrats in shock
Lots of jobs building more Tomahawk missiles. Stop supporting terrorism!
Bullshit
Tarriffs will kill port work. If it happens look for the ILA, Teamsters and truckers to strike.
March Jobs Report..."far less than projected"  98,000 vs 180k projected....what say ye now braggart?
Don't take credit for @BarackObama's accomplishments and hard work.  You sit in the Oval Office illegitimately.
All because of President Obama's hard work!
Your job reports sucks. It's the worst!!
