The President can fire anyone he wants. That’s why he’s the President. Time to look at Mueller. Is he about to go bye bye on his year anniversary of dividing America?
It’s been settled. House Intel said it. Everyone said it. There was no Russian collusion. It was a total farce to try and hinder the President’s first term. Maybe they thought they could scare him out. Nah.
They House won’t impeach Trump if he fires Mueller and NEITHER will the Senate. If this crap continues until the midterms come, we should not have an election. You can’t vote when the voting system is under investigation. See how that works?
Mueller was appointed to look at (fake) Russian collusion. He has no jurisdiction going  after Manafort from 10 years ago, Trump’s businesses prior to 2015 or anything else. Stick to the scope you were given.
So we're supposed to ignore all their other crimes? I don't think so.
FIRE DIRTY COP MUELLER!
Yet Trump claims he and those investigating him are all democrats when they are all republicans. He just can't help himself with the lies huh?
You are being disingenuous if you can't see Mueller's bias against DJT
He’s simply doing his job and upholding the law. Thank goodness someone is.
If he was so honorable as you think he is, he would have recused himself at the beginning. Additionally, he's not even trying to appear unbiased with his team of lawyers being Never-Trump.
Why on earth would he recuse himself?!
You are kidding, right? He had too many conflicts to be considered unbiased, but they let him in. Now he is protecting his friends.
Everyday~it's a new attack on our President.
In most countries, coup d’etat happens when the military tries to overthrow the government. We have a small group of Corrupt Politicians+Gov Officials colluding to take down President Trump, who is the best Pres we ever had. #MayDay
Really? Please explain how he is the best president ever
They are indeed, POTUS.
NO ONE is above the law!!
Keep telling yourself that you are better than everyone else in this country.  It will serve you no good.  We have something called the CONSTITUTION
Your tweets are resembling those of a madman who knows they are in for an awakening.

This is real smoking of weed
Get some good lawyers!

Blessed is the #man who endures #temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the #crown of #life which the #Lord has promised to those who love Him.

Not!

And what is it about a classy black man that scares you and others so much? Nvm, I've actually got a very good idea, pee-wee
No one is questioning your ability to fire at will. Everyone in your branch serves at your pleasure.

But you said you fired him to stop an investigation. You exercised a lawful right in ORDER to break the law.

It's lawful to enter a store. It's not lawful to do it to shoplift.
No ones questioning your power to fire someone.  It's did you do it to obstruct an investigation?
The president is not a king dictator.  

The president is subject to the law like any other citizen.

The justice department and FBI disagree with this attorney.  

This is more nonsense from a guilty president who knows he is about to be held accountable for his crimes.
@realDonaldTrump please stop harming America to protect yourself.  Please stop lying to us and dividing us.  

You took an oath to uphold the constitution and represent Americans and you break it every day. 

Resign and fade away.  #Resign #25thAmendment #ImpeachTrump

Can you fire Jeff Sessions already?
You're going down Dotard. You can't bluff your way out of this mess. You're family is going down with you.

Even you don’t know what you are thinking , you seem scared or else you would gladly say you would answer truthfully and honestly and with pleasure to clear your name , agree to do it at the “second White House” just bill the taxpayers

@SenMajLdr Why don't you do the right thing for once. Do your job (which is for the people) & bring the bipartisan legislation to the floor protecting Mueller. We know you don't have a snowballs chance in hell at winning so much as a free ticket on a scratch off. But come on now
Hey #MAGA, @realDonaldTrump is very scared:
- Being interviewed is never a trap, unless you're guilty or lie
  - Trump knows he guilty so will try to lie
- Mueller has 
  - 75 charges filed
  - 19 people charged
  - 13 Russians charged
  - 5 guilty pleas
  - 4 people cooperating
John except if they're setting legal traps to get you.
I see the naked emperor is working hard today. 
Seems to be a pattern.
That's how you know trumps team leaked the questions after changing them. Mueller isn't dumb enough to ask him what he was thinking.
Like a child clawing at the edges of a truth to cover up a much larger and scarier lie...
No American power is absolute.  Checks and balances.

There are hundreds of FBI investigators working on this.  He would have to fire the entire department and then it STILL wouldn't stop.  This investigation will continue no matter how many good men he defames and fires.  So buckle up because you're in for a rude awakening
Did you witte Your own bill of health only crooks do
You should seek better counsel. Sir.
So you’re quoting a guy that even you wouldn’t hire.  Reports must be accurate. You are desperate. 
Please keep tweeting....please keep tweeting...please keep tweeting...it's more AMMO for the special prosecutor
It's called a criminal investigation and the President isn't above the law!
Here's an idea.  You don't sit down with Mueller.  Then he will Subpoena the sh!t out of you!  I can't wait.
If you really believe that Mueller needs to talk to you in order to indict you, you are mistaken.  He has a case against you whether you testify or not -- just a stronger one if you don't.
He's a SWAMP SNAKE!!!  

Digenova is an extremely intelligent lawyer.

Rudy Giuliani just...came out and...said it.
Hannity's reaction is fucking gold.

I'm really loving this season of "Stupid Watergate".
…
For his role in the 2016 campaign, #guilliani should be interviewed by #MuellerProbe as he signaled ‘something big is coming’ in about 2 weeks, a big surprise he said. What did he know, who told him what, what were all his interactions! Trump picked flawed #attorney #guilliani
just put him back on fox and have hannity ask..... 
hahaha, he said "the constitution" as though that is still a thing. lol
Yeah right, maybe they should have a mandatory refresher course for all government officials.
I think they might benefit more from a remedial course than a refresher. lol
I wouldn’t be surprised if many have never read it in the first place?
Apparently someone tried to explain the constitution to Trump, he got bored and wandered off at the 4th amendment lol!
Virtually no part of the constitution is obeyed or observed by any part of the govt.
That’s the major reason the swamp needs to go, and everyone connected to it.
But it is NOT going.  It is still here.  Why has he not abolished the dept of education? It is laughably unconstitutional and a source of untold damage.
Any thinking, objective person who sits back, calmly, and sees the bigger picture here, can see a man terrified of having to answer questions under oath. Hillary Clinton did it. Bill Clinton did it. Why are you more afraid than they were?
Hillary Clinton was never under oath...
Stop the tweets please, I voted for you but need you to focus on the job at hand not twitter rants.....
Shame on you... voting for this nut job and traitor.. focus?  Please
They are Jay Sekulow’s questions. He’s YOUR lawyer.

Well, that was stupud
Mueller is a failure and needs to get out—after 18 months he has nothing-
You have no idea what Mueller has. The investigation continues and the results will be released at the appropriate time.

Cute
Clean out the FBI and DOJ. Fire, Fire, Fire.
And then what?
Hire good people.  No more democrats ever
If you killed any one and They know about it, it doesn't matter who you fire... If Cohen has already told them where the bodys are buried, they already know...
ATTN TRUMP ATTORNEYS!!! Give @POTUS back his phone. You are not fooling anyone here.
Have you ever read the Constitution?
Fire Mueller, Rosenstain and the rest of the Clinton corrupt dogs. They are still hanging on and using to collect dirt to use the media against Trump supporters. Just end this charade and to hell with those who whine about it. Time to get on with what Trump was elected for!
Yes, please, Mr. "President," Fire Mueller, Rosenstein, and then... Go Directly to Jail, Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200. #TreasonousTrump #ButHerEmailsNotADefense
How long do you figure it took for Dickwheel to actually quote this?  I mean, they are all new and big words....not his wheelhouse, as they say.
He didn't write this, we all know he can't form a cohesive paragraph. Much less spell big words. This whole administration is so full of !!!
Amen.  But, let's consider what the others who wrote it for him were thinking....
I’ll just leave you all with this - have a fantastic day!!!
I prefer the shot when the Bald Eagle attacks him and he cowers....
Ahhhh yes........for your viewing pleasure. 
It’s still one of the best
Sez it all....
Exactly, so DO NOT TESTIFY, screw Mueller..
I would NOT testify.  Never.

Sir, Since are advocating that presidents can do no wrong, explain this to American people. What about Nixon? Can Presidents obstruct justice? Where do you draw the line? Are you saying we will never have a bad head of state? What does Checks and balances mean in your view?
 good choice of Rudy. He help the Stormy case and Mueller with one interview.
If you were innocent you wouldn't fire people for investigating you.
Use it
Has anyone told you this is NOT an episode of The Apprentice? Your goal is not to get attention or fire whoever you want.
if you were smart.. you’re not.. but if you were, you’d resign. but you’re too stubborn and that stubbornness will put you behind bars and broke.. you’ve been warned

If we give you the Nobel Peace Prize, your own reality TV show on Fox, and CNN reports that you have a large penis will you just resign and walk away?
CNN doesn’t normally report falsehoods.
So true Dear President Trump.

You admitted the reason on national TV and to Russia Dotard.
You have bad lawyers. It's hilarious.
Oh Lord just shut your trap already jeez. How do you know Trump is talking lies? His fingers are tweeting!
Good Lord , Trump, you must be really guilty if you feel like you have to fire Mueller.
Federal law, Section 30121 of Title 52, makes it a crime for any foreigner to contribute or donate money or some “other thing of value” in connection with an American election, or for anyone to solicit a foreigner to do so
Like in the case of the fake dossier?
So many #PutinBots raging on Twitter to report to #TeamPatriot, here is yet another stupid one= "Mike" is a PutinsPuppet and doesn't comprehend US Law: the FACTUAL Steele Dossier followed All US Laws= a Law Firm rep Clinton Campaign PAID For The Op Research AND Filed Info w/SEC!!

Mueller questions are...what is your favorite color
after reading this incoherent rambling tweet, i get the jist and your are correct you can fire anyone unless your are obstructing justice in a investigation. so it's not outrageous, millions of people watched you in the Lester Holt interview.sadly you are still doing it daily.
You are the last person that should be quoting policy #someonewhoactuallyupholdspolicy

Guess fire is getting closer huh Don the Con?!
So Comey wouldn’t tell you if you were a FBI target, and you fired him for that.  Sounds like obstruction to me.  Thanks, Rudy!
You’re insane.
ThankYou, Mr President. . .
For all that YOU HAVE ACHIEVED in 15 months+
“Elections have consequences” -B. Hussein O.” 
It is clearly part of the Constitution that we can fire your rear end as well mr. Trump.
Not buying it Donald
Do you even know how to quote right?? This makes no sense. 
God has raised up Mr Trump to clean up America and its corrupt politicians. Everyone fighting him is against Gods hand and judgement will fall upon each one of them!
What part of #Trump was #God raising up when he was in the bedroom with #StormyDaniels?
“So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”
John 8:7 KJV
Hmmm... seems like you want to be a dictator... guess we’ve given democracy a chance and you now want to end it...

I wonder why you only quote attorneys that agree with your whacko point of view and why do you have so much time to tweet and tweet isn’t that keeping you from all your important” Presidenty “stuff
#TrumpRICO
Haha...you don’t even know what the constitution says!!! If you have nothing to worry about meet with Mueller...you are the one dragging this out!!!
Americans are not right up there to have this animal djt leading the country. Donald you are not welcome in the UK. Certainly won’t meet the queen
Pursuant to federal law, Trump's DOJ appointee appointed lifelong Republican #Mueller to investigate Kremlin interference in the 2016 election & that investigation uncovered evidence that Trump campaign may have coordinated w/ Kremlin- diGenava is dead wrong. #ThursdayThoughts
You will not like to be President with the House and Senate controlled by Democrats in November....

He sure does - unless such termination is an attempt to cover up said President's crimes - in which case it's called "obstruction of justice."

But you knew that - Emmet told ya
Have you listened to the “president” at all?  Maybe you should go play a round of golf with him and get to know him a little better.  Then you might side with the rest of America and want him out too.
Copying for a test again ?

Sure you can.  It still makes the case for obstruction of justice but that was your boneheaded decision.  Then then one to go on camera and admit to it to Lester Holt...shall we continue with ways you’re sending yourself to prison?  #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime

Fire your Justice Department. 

MSM will complain whatever. Appoint Rudy as AG. 

Anyone ever going to mention the word treason?
Sure, but... Grammar.

SPANKY thinks we are as stupid as he is! Bye bye CHUMP! We are going to IMPEACH you! You are a disgrace to America! 

Umm. Nope, I don't think so. You can fire political appointees at will. You need cause for everyone else.
What are you so afraid of ?
It is ILLEGAL for you to Fire ANY other EMPLOYEE of the U.S. Federal Government "WITHOUT JUST CAUSE"..In other words criminal Trump, "The Russer thang" is exactly one of the specific reasons you could NOT legally fire Comey; but we all now realize you are too moronic to get that.
The questions were written and leaked by your own legal team. The FBI didn't give specific questions, only vague topics. Its easily proven in court. If you're innocent, sit through an interrogation like Hillary did. Unless you're chicken =P
Lawyers-shmoyers. Be a man. Tell the truth. Your supporters can handle the truth. Remember one of your favorite campaign statements?  “If I shot a man on 5th Avenue they’d still vote for me”? Go with what you know.

That's funny! YOU trying to use the Constitution as an excuse to get out of all this.
You have to have good cause, otherwise you will be obstructing justice - more than you already have, that is.
You got more Dots than a diner.
Rudy outed you on 2 biggies tonight and you can't cry FAKE NEWS, because it was on your favorite channel. How many Diet Coke's have you had this evening? Need some chicken nuggets before beddie-bye?
Pretty sure that would trigger impeachment for obstruction to justice. That wouldn't be smart.

The problem is he doesn’t realize he can’t fire people in the Justice Dept. he still doesn’t understand there are three branches of government like any 5th grader should. Basically he’s an idiot and Rudy just out another nail in his coffin or maybe another button on his jumpsuit.
You’re “an outrageous”
Fire Mueller and Rosenstein. Then reopen Hillary's BS server investigation, then the DNC server and the Clinton Foundation. If Mr. Sessions won't do it fire him.
Ummmm...what happened to checks and balances? It’s LAUGHABLE you think you can do whatever you want with ZERO repercussions. Wedonotliveinadictatorship. Mueller has every right to question your motives. He’s part of the checks and balances

Mr.@realDonaldTrump, the USA is trying to understand your intent on your firing of Mr. Comey. Just give your time to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller. Let the American people decide. Okay?
Too bad we don’t have a legitimate president
You weren't paying attention in November of 2016 when we the people elected him then. He is very legitimate and he is the president and we will re-elect him in 2020.
I watched with keenness.  You player lost by millions of votes. Millions more Americans voted for Hillary.  Millions more would’ve voted for Hillary if this information would have came out. But because of Russia’s collusion and Facebook help through Cambridge we see the looser
The electoral college is wonderful thing too. Thank God we dodged the Hillary bullet or we would all be screwed. #TRUMP2020
Unfortunately it did screw the will of the people over. The majority of the peace wanted Hillary. So less people made a racist a bigot a adulterous womanizer absence das potus
Mueller and Comey have disgraced the FBI and the laws of the United States.  Fire him!
You are a special kind of stupid - the kind Trump loves
Good thing we have you to tell us how we should think.  And of course if we aren’t sheep and don’t think like you, we must be wrong, right?
No, that would be what Trump says. Try paying attention, I know it hard when you are that stupid.
Yes, master.
An innocent man would not act this way. #CriminalInChief
Quoting people you see on Fox, another brilliant defense. Keep the great ideas coming! #POSPOTUS
The previous admin & current insider globalist + democrats have exactly tried to 1.Coup 2. Set up a threatening usurper as a overlord that's omnipotent & cant be removed. Sounds like a coup dictatorship a little bit?
If you had not tweeted and admitted to Lestor on the air....no one would be looking at Obstruction!!  You did it to your self!  Guilty!!!!  Btw Rudy is only making things worse....a bafoon out for money and publicity. SAD!
Can't you find a real attorney?
It’s not a crime to lie to the media, it is a crime to accept a campaign donation like what this would be classified had he stuck to the “I’m ignorant” excuse.   Rudy just pulled the bad aid off quickly, it was always going to be coming off though.


"what the President was thinking is an outrageous..."? He's kinda right. What the president was thinking was that Comey wasn't swearing fealty to him & promising to make the big, bad, Russia Investigation go away for him. Outrageous thing is POTUS is a Traitor CONSPIRING w Russia
In the 466 days since he took the oath of office, Trump has made 3,001 false or misleading claims, according to The Fact Checker’s database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement uttered by the president.
That’s an average of nearly 6.5 claims a day.
Nope. You can’t fire anyone in the furtherance of criminal behavior. And you can’t pardon anyone with the same intent. @IvankaTrump @gop
The whole Mueller, Comey, Lynch, Holder side show needs to end!! NOW!! Their intermingled corruption goes way back. Let’s start just with Whitewater on through Clinton’s impeachment, to Comey at HSBC and massive donations directed to HRC. They were all involved. Where is our AG?!
Not to mention his stint at Lockheed Martin.
Cigar chomping TV hack


Clearly the Dotard didn’t write this, as there are no spelling errors and no “Witch Hunt!” at the end. And we all know unfettered isn’t one of the 12 vocabulary words left in his decaying brain.
Your days are numbered!
Except, you can't fire anyone to hide a crime. Get your comfortable suit out. Going to be testifying in front of grand jury for a day or two.
BUILD THAT WALL!
And #Joe is a #Brilliant #Attorney!
You should fire whoever you think deserves it. Over half the country is behind you

Like the #FakePresident thinks! C'mon now!! #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime
Agreed, we all know the President couldn't possibly have been thinking.
Or is it....
Your bots and trolls are very busy this morning, treason weasel.  It doesn't matter, we are going to #ImpeachTrumpNow
WTF
Aha, sure, im just waiting that you take the the Fifth so America can win on impeachment bingo, so just hurry. mister "We will have a constitutional crisis if you cant fire the people investigating him for firing people investigating you" you are not fooling anyone #DonaldJDrumpf
If you fire people in an attempt to obstruct justice, that's a crime. If anyone is telling you otherwise, best not listen. You are obsessing over this. Don't make a huge mistake.  Or do, and we'll be rid of you.
Probably a witch hunt....

A presidents power to fire may be unfettered UNLESS he does so with the INTENT to interfere with or shut down an investigation into his own criminal acts
The president is not above the law!

A man who has committed so many crimes, with so much to hide, should have thought about it before deciding to run for president.  Big microscope!

I guess you thought you could control the country's media & law they way you did NY.
Oh you’re answering them all now! 
And thank Rudy for us.

Sincerely, America
Why are so many Trump supporters thinking it's a good idea not to testify to Mueller?  Only someone worried or trying to hide something would have a problem being truthful.  Does this mean his MAGA peeps are okay with possible criminals not having to face a trial?

Let God arise and His enemies be scattered. Many will be going down. Jail. Shame. Mostly liberals. Those who have hate towards our president and our freedoms. God help you haters. Hell is forever

You are right. What you’re thinking is outrageous. #Traitor #Treason #nolockup #gallows
Not accurate.  Get a better lawyer.

Well, whoever released those questions needs to have their head handed back to them on a platter. Mr. Mueller is trying to make up a crime with those questions, Rod Rosenstein should be stopped he's allowing an unbridled inquisition off of the topic of the original probe
“What the president was thinking was an outrageous.” What does that even mean? An outrageous what? Does anyone proofread?
come to brazil
I'm curious about your usage of ellipses. It's probably just an indication of what's between your ears. Thank God you have a neck or that thing would just float away.
Wrong.

More gibberish. Your specialty!
Firing will not make the truth go away. However, you may avoid some jail time.
Sounds like you need to hire Joe- or does he have "conflicts of interest" too?
Have you heard of the terms "criminal intent," "conspiracy," "sedition," or "accessory?" If not, you should ask your legal team about them.

So you’re willing to answer questions or Nah?
But you’ve always been so forthcoming with your (made-up reality) story...
How is it that Dirty Donald Trump is advised to not answer Mueller Questions because Trump will revile a crime..So Then I ask everyone reading this. How is Dirty Donald Qualified To make decisions on behalf of This Country
I mean, maybe sure... But if you try it, it won't stop what's been set in motion. This will roll over you like a tidal wave. Might be time to start thinking resignation.
The questions are fabricated by your legal team.
Did you plagiarize this tweet?
Looks like @realDonaldTrump (or someone operating his account) is copy/pasting Mediaite. 
Traitor
