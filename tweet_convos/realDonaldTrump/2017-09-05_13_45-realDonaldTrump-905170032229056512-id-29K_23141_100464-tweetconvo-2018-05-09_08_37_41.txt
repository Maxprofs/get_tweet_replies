You are a racist!
What has he done that's racist? Deporting illegal immigrants isn't racist. They're criminals
I don't understand how being brought into the US as children makes them criminals. Could you please explain how they are criminals?
Last time I checked, being "illegal" is against the law
That's true. But, there's the niggling fact that they came in as minors, and were under their parents' control. 1/2
No being undocumented is not a crime

Even when one is in violation of the immigration laws
Unless of course you are removing better qualified people. That's a definite possibility here. Why is that a good thing?
I wish you'd take a moment to read Obama's statement he put out relative to this decision.
@realDonaldTrump... Destroying the American Dream. One day at a time. #Goals
..
Killing #DACA won't improve the life of a single American. They pay taxes and have jobs most aren't even qualified for. This is pure evil.
Kidding? You could have done this while extending DACA! You are a coward. You are a liar. Quick...what does DACA stand for?
#DefendDACA
You continue to destroy this country and tear what America is supposed to be about apart. You are the worst "President" ever!
Yes, this is my hope and prayer.
You won't be there long enough. Get a life and remember how your family got here.
Compared to Trump, Dreamers are:
 More Literate 
 Harder Working
 More Patriotic
 Better Educated
 More Compassionate
 Inspiring
Your retardation is showing
Thank you Mr President for being the ONE person in government that prioritizes citizens over illegals!

Ugggh. Terrible.

Obama still acting as president in the background, ask @FBI  @CIIA fugget it just don't ask any questions watch the series on Netflix
I'm really getting tired of defending you on this daca thing please tell me why. Is it the wall? You must get that going, and I mean going
I look forward to your resignation or impeachment!

#25thAmendmentNow #LiarInChief #WorstPOTUSinHistory
Fake president
BE QUIET!!! You just rescinded DACA! You don't want bipartisanship efforts toward immigration reform!
Enough with the Nazi-inspired "Me First" speeches. Just resign already, please.
you're so delusional and trying to cover up the Russia corruption. Just resign and let us have America back
Does that include people from Slovenia? Asking for someone else.
You're a coward.  Just quit and #MAGA for the first time since you took office.  Coward.
that's what you really care about? Putting hard working people 1st?? #alltalk

To recap: A guy who dodged the draft, colluded with Russia, and defended Nazis gets to decide who's American enough to stay in the country.
Woohoo! I can count on you to do the right thing!
#WINNING
Right... we believe you... 
I look forward to you going to jail or being impeached.

You're the worst THING that has ever happened to America.
Legend
America has never seemed more UnAmerican as today!
America didn't do this. But now everyone has to undo what Donald has done.
And when it fails, you'll blame the Dems instead of your Republican controlled House and Senate because you cannot admit your own failures.
The US needs immigrant workers you fool. Your white supremacist buddies and nazi mates don't work for the basic wage so who is going to? Sad
Are they finally pushing you out?
You never served, did you? Unlike many "immigrants". (you mean non-whites)
Everyone knows what you have in mind when ending DACA.

Even the Germans know...
Psalm 118:26
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the #Lord! We have blessed you from the #house of the #Lord.
Proverbs 11:14
Where there is no #counsel, the #people fall; But in the #multitude of #counselors there is #safety.
Psalm 120:1
A Song of Ascents. In my #distress I cried to the #Lord, And He heard me.

Gloating in the fact that you are a heartless leviathan? DACA revocation got you cool points with your Nazi & KKK buddies
I'm sure there are high-fiving each other chanting "Jews will not replace us" and other despicable things! Absolutely disgusting!
Only the most vile among us would choose to penalize innocent children. You disgust me!
Children?? Therr in their 30's. Obama had Dem senate, house, presidency 09-10 immigration wasn't a priority they wanted Obamacare
BS. you want to perpetuate racism in the US.
No that was Obama. Obama does that.
Right... Obama was so anti-immigrant and KKK centric
Obama's DACA is illegal. Just like the ILLEGAL immigrants who had the opportunity to become citizens.
Obama's order isn't illegal and he WANTED congress to send him a bill. They didn't.
And you wonder why? Hmm maybe bc it was illegal?
An immigration bill from congress would be illegal?
DACA recipients must pay a penalty, then reimburse the US for subsistence, health care & education. That's DACA's obligation. #Tweets4Trump
Who R 800K blank faces of DACA? How old? How many working, in school? Where? We must blindly hand over tax& w/no info! Enough! USA 1st
I didn't vote for you to give illegals legal status,so sick of this crap
You are a shell of a man without a spirit, soul or heart and massive hate for President Obama. A man you'll never measure up to. #MAGA
It really isn't about President Obama.
It is
Do tell if not....
No it isn't. But, it's   icing on the cake. It's about Trump's pathetic evil base.
POTUS didn't have a silver spoon as we know n BLOTUS is angry after spending all that money on him n his upbringing he's still PW trash
1/2 C we as POC got an eye 4 racism while everyone was asleep or saying we r usin the race card. It takes those that decry abt our imagining
2/2 racism to not disregard what we feel but acknowledge n help to fight it. Racism hurts everyone. #Heather Heyer
I look forward to your impeachment. Your sons imprisonment...Your Daughter testifying under oath and Welcoming president Mattis..
Pence lied. He knew about Flynn was notified in a letter. Paul Ryan..screwed...It will go to Orrin Hatch..
Let's see @FLOTUS papers. If they aren't in order she needs to be on the first flight out! She didn't graduate college & worked w/out visa!
I just think it's pathetic that the only thing that has resonated with congress to get going is giving DREAMers rights they didn't earn.

On @FoxNews I see trump speech live about momentous Tax reform and on @CNN @jaketapper is talking about Bernie's ABS. #fakenews @Cernovich
#BuildTheWall

Yes yes yes 
I have been making this point everyday. MSM never points out the money that goes back south.
Eo13603 needs to be CAancelled! RED CROSS STEALS CLOTHES diapers and food from churches in Harvey path! Only .90c of $10 goes to victims
You betrayed Americans! I voted for you & trusted you keep your promise and END DACA! I should have just voted for Hillary Clinton!!! 
Boss, they don't want to put America 1st !
They want to put themselves 1st !
Thats why they took the whole month of August for a VACATION !
Put actual US Citizens first--not the fraudulent DACA program people or illegals! Breaks your promise!
We all know this is the swamp's evil doing .. let's try to get something tangible in the process tho ..
We The People still have power over the swamp as we witnessed in 2016 ..and elections are on our side.
Kick #JeffSessions in the ass and get him removing the deep State criminals get Rid of Paul Ryan and the Evil bald headed general McMaster!
We need Tax Reform, Mr. President. Your deal with Chuckie and Nancy may have screwed up opportunity to REFORM tax code.
With his IQ and mine, I'll take his judgement any day 
Hope you R right.
President Trump you can measure your success by the backlash of the MSM. You've been doing great! We support you 100%!
#45ROCKS
Forcing congressional lawmakers to do their jobs so preside Trump can do his! #45ROCKS!
And who are you listening to? Why did you cave to the Demoncrats' far left bolshevik agenda? Your base isn't happy about this at all.
Your base expects you to keep your promises you made to us. You are letting us down by lurching left and caving 2 the Demoncrats.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump We Awaiting PRES TRUMP LOWER TAXES for All Americans! #LowerTaxes #MAGA
I am sure Canada and Europe would be more than happy to take these kids in. You know, educated, hard working, and patriotic
I'd say get full funding 4 border wall/security & nationwide voter ID in exchange 4 DACA w/ strict rules!
DACA kids ARE hardworking citizens in this country. They are more a citizen then your wife!
I look forward 2 R's finding their collective backbone & pushing u  out of the White House. Nearly everything u do makes America worse.
1/2 Dems are the opposition. That is what they do in a democracy. You have to get your GOP to have a sensible tilt at legislation.

Proud President Trump is upholding our immigration laws. Hopefully Congress will do their job.
You say 'citizens' when you know there are plenty of hardworking, tax paying folk under DACA that you have just declared subhuman. Racist!
Well my initials are DRBS
Your kidding right there's no chance of that happening
And innocent dreamers who love this country!
Thank you enforcing the rule of law. As a nation we have to follow the law, it we are not a nation.
U are just heartless and want others to do your dirty work. Now u are blaming the dems, and putting down anyone that disagree with ur logic
How bout putting the HUMANS that work hard for this country first?? These dreamers are students, children, hard workers trying to make it!
Be careful sir, Lawrence O'Donnel and Rachel Maddow may twist it all around.
They always do, what’s new.
Deport all illegal aliens! I'm sick of these invaders stealing what's ours!
Strange, NONE of them seem to want to work with YOU! Only on your IMPEACHMENT! I wish they'd hurry!
Wonder what it would be like to have a president who would understand that apostrophes indicate possession and do no render nouns plural.
Thou canst remember President Obama.
@Trump45Michael buenas noches .

Just build the Wall already.
Thank you @POTUS for keeping your word! #MAGA 
These "dreamers" are our friends, neighbors, and lovers. They were brought here by families searching for the American dream. #DefendDACA

I look forward to the day you are no longer President.
You misspelled "mass deportations of incompatible third worlders"
Yeah do that and keep fucking the truckers. We should be way more important than some illegals. Although we are treated like criminals now due to ELD mandate
Can you please stop tweeting ..? You are the world leader now ..just put duck tape on your mouth .. please ..
Make America Great again and put citizens First and everything will work out Fine.
Don't ever forget- American citizens must come first!!!
End #DACA deport #IllegalAliens
I think you are a great President ever but that #DACA  is really messed but
Don't let them manipulate you! We cannot continue to reward those who enter illegally! Without laws, we have no country!
Good luck with getting them to do anything
You are amazing !!  Keep up the good work. You have everyone in that swamp freaked out. We love you. Riding out this hurricane.  Faith
Lazy Americans are pissed off because motivated immigrants are more qualified than they are. White racists are mad that they're unemployable
."“What a cruel, sour place is Trump’s America,” Helen O’Rahilly, an Irish television executive, wrote on Twitter."
You forgot "and brown people last" but maybe you ran out of characters? #SaveDACA
Mr. President the Dems don't wanna work with anyone they want totalitarian control of everything. You are our only hope. Dont work with dems
Please remind me what the republican controlled house/senate do under Obama? Wait I remember, pure obstruction! Where is your criticism?
Obstruct my foot! They went along with everything obommie the commie wanted. They didn't try to obstruct. If they did I'd have been happt
I can already tell where this conversation is going with "obommie the commie". Grown adults that can't have any meaningful political conv.
Love Trump!
By hard working citizens you mean white citizens?  They won't get off welfare and work.  They won't do the menial work.
And I appreciate you talking to the dems about working on DACA.  Terrific!  Great deal!  Bipartisan govt for the win!
America is beginning to heal.
Put the victims of natural destruction first
We love u Mr. President. Thank u so much. We're here supporting u all the way. Sorry ur going thru all this crap. It's going to get better 
No amnesty. We voted to repeal Obamas illigal action, not enshrine them! Come on Mr. President, we the people believed in you.
Thank you President Trump just round them up and return them to their rightful countries it's time Americans took their country back

Sad, U caved. Must take harder line bcause they wont give anything-xcept our $  What about US dreams. None but me & my dad paid f my college

While your with them, the veterans need a yes vote to use our education funds to start a business instead of on schooling. Many older vets want to start a business instead of education.
reform? clean and good government
I hope that means will be making sure that we take care of every single veteran that is in our country. If they aren't hardworking, who is?
Reform is another word for amnesty! We already have functional laws & penalties if broken! Enforce existing laws!!!
Ok, w/ the ceiling raised, hrs my deal 2 you, fix your shit on Global Warming, DACA, and the Wall, and I will stop calling u human garbage.
Trump is a threat to the corrupted in D.C. They will resist giving up their gravy train.
Working with Schumer is NEVER a good thing.
Nothing you do or say at this point or ever,  is or was  acceptable or relevant
White house and Congress make a real big circus about try to make America great but is getting worse
STOP DACA Build wall
You are ALL such talk and no effective action. Terrible legacy for the Trump fam. (Should've stayed out of politics, right @DonaldJTrumpJr)
cause u already know they will fail, and if not u look good cause u let em try lol lol smart man
so refreshing!! just think, something getting done in congress. Good job, sir. GO TRUMP!@
There is NO working with those Progressives, only agreeing with them...... SO DON'T !!!
Immigration Reform = Amnesty. WTHell 
Boring....

When DACA "kids" get free tuition and take out student loans, that's NOT putting citizens first, is it? End DACA now!
Thank you, Mr. President.  America First immigration policy is a long-needed, welcome change!
This is misleading and revealing at the same time. You're not fooling anyone. How's Trump Tower Moscow progressing? Mueller will find out.

Make them citizens.  They are already hard working!
Both of them just want to screw you
build the wall!!!!!
Oh like hard working dreamers? #45isAmonster #unfit #impeach
Working together to #MAGA! I will pray hard on this. Blessings!
Eventually both Gouses will realize who is in charge and who will submit or be gone. #ThankYouTrump #USA #AMERICA #MAGA Drain the SWAMP
No REFORM/DEPORT & BUILD THE FRIKIN WALL!
We do not need reform enforce the laws we have
thank you Mr. President
Thank you President Trump for looking out for the American Citizens First!
Yeah, right. I've worked hard & long supporting & defending you. I feel http://played.One  thing after another.. Purging Cons.Keep 0..

AMERICA FIRST,
       PERIOD!
So you think that the American guy with a high school diploma should be the doctor instead of the immigrant with a doctors education?
Mr President,when are you going to finally tam the North Korean brat?
Definition of "real hard working Americans" ...is...

Anyone who doesn't take as many Golf vacation days, as Donald Trump
Pass the buck again.  You can't take any responsibility for anything.  What a complete loser.
Lead us across party lines !
We should apply Mexico's immigration policies to Mexicans wanting to enter the USA.
No need for reform. (only seems like a p.r. move)
Just uphold existing laws!  Don't flip flop!
Let's first identify non-hardworking Americans and deport them first.
Yeah.The worst of the worst, Pelosi & Schumer have big smiles today. So do the Dreamers who Ryan, Graham call America's BEST & BRIGHTEST!
Mr. President sir I understand that you have to work with both parties. However neither one of them have America's best interest at heart.
Yeah! You go @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  #MAGA 
I have hated some people in my life, but I've never hated anyone the way I hate you. That includes Ted Bundy.
Bring Obama back-a real classy President. Not a fool like you @Donald trump!
As a president should do.. democrat or republican... we are all Americans
How can they be hardworking if they dnt have a job lol
Ahh now I think I understand why Der Trumpenstuffen agreed to the debt deal. The @POTUS wants to deport all #Democrats #crookeddonald
That's right mr. president America first thank you for that.
Please call @BarackObama and see if he can fill in for a couple years quick


You are a fuckknuckle beyond compare. I just want you to know that the whole of Australia hates you too.
Keep reaching across the aisle and you will get some real support. Good move :)

@DonaldJTrumpJr is about as dumb as they come, and that is GOOD for our laws and justice system. https://twitter.com/RawStory/status/905832855900737537 …
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Even a chance to see our government to work again warms my heart!
You need me and I want to help you.... f.denny@icloud.com
I don't see that happening Not cuz I'm a naysayer but because congress HATES U.S. citizens & can't exploit them like illegals #DrainTheSwamp

Sensible POTUS
I think this is the wisest start to immigration reform:
Recipients of #DACA ARE hardworking Americans.
Yes, that is the right thing to do.
I'm looking forward to someone finally doing something pro American! It's been so long that we have been made feel guilty instead of proud!
I don't feel guilty about anything, do you?  Trump is my man. Plus he don't support baby murderers.
I don't feel guilty, but it isn't for their lack of trying....
Yeah , if the turn coat republicans would fulfill their promises made durning their campaigns. Trump could get things done
Instead of having to compromise with the dems
how would you know about being a hardworking citizen you have lived a privileged life with out worrying about bill and owing $
Dreamers are hardworking, real people who have often lived here since early childhood. They deserve better. America deserves better.
