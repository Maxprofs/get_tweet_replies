Another way to cheat because that’s all the @GOP knows how to do . You were Putin @WhiteHouse with a manipulated antiquated EC. Designed when we were only 13 colonies and the South claimed slave votes . Demographics have changed.
#WeBleedPurple
Trump CAN'T except compremise
He WANTS TOTAL VETO POWER FROM THE SENATE.
HEY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET RID OF HIM?
HE IS A .MOLESTER,  A TRAITOR,   AND HAS ALZHEIMER'S! THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE USA- AND DOESN'T HE DO US PROUD!  (YUCH)
We have the faith. We stand beside you.  We want to #KAG2018 . We will fight to keep our #1StAmendment &#2ADefenders #2AShallNotBeInfringed . We will fight against #ChildTrafficking & to #SaveTheChildren.Ty for #MAGA #Trump 
Potus, we are working hard out here trying to get people to vote. Most feel hopeless because of the obvious cheating of votes coming on the Democrats side. We must fix our voting system. We have accomplished many great things but can’t seem to fix our election process. 
The only thing that needs to be shut down in this country would be you and your fellow swamp dwellers . I'm sick of the corruption. 
 
Yes 51% as soon as the dems take back both chambers
Or send you to federal prison while you await a firing squad for TREASON!!!
You got your shutdown, Scooter.  How did it work out for you?
NO SHUTDOWN is a good shutdown.
I'd much rather have Trump than that corrupt evil idiot B clinton. 
What this country really needs is 15% government cut in expenses and get ride of the automatic increase in spending. And how about a F'ing budget. Intrenched Dems and repubs r the prob


Watch the moment Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) tried to pass a bill guaranteeing military pay and death benefits during the gov’t shutdown — and GOP leader Mitch McConnell blocked it

Maybe if you take some of your porn girlfriends? They might change their minds.
From the bottom of my heart at the bottom of the world, with respect sir, please resign. This joke is no longer funny.
I bet the 66.1k ppl who supported this are blaming dems now.
I
YOU ARE A CIMPLETE FAILURE!! Guess BANKRUPTING CASINOS, wasn't enough! Your STUPIDITY is now trying to include America!! Guess what, FUCKTARD!! You are fueling a massive BLUE wave!! Ty!!
Got some news for you Donnie the D*ckless Wonder: yep we're going to elect new senators alright but not Repugnicans. You screwed the pooch on that one. It's all on YOU - and it'll be your legacy 
?????
Self-fulfilling prophecy
You orchestrated the government shutdown, hurting America and it will backfire. You know there's going to be a blood bath Nov. 2018. @SpeakerRyan and @SenMajLdr warned you after the #CorruptGOP passed #TaxScamBill, so your using #TrumpShutdown to gain favor. Never going to work!
Amen, @SenateMajLdr change the rules to simple majority vote. YOU KNOW Harry Reed would in a heartbeat! Do it !
You got your #TrumpShutdown so why are you so afraid to take credit for it?
who's president?  you or Stephen Miller
#TrumpShutdown
With a majority in govt you can't get the job done,  what makes you think you'll get it done with 51% ? #imbecile  #Dealmaker #fraud #ShitholePresident
This aged well.
Just say to hell with it all and pack up your marbles and go home!  Whine, whine, whine.
What a great idea donny!! Let’s change all the rules then! No more electoral college!! 45mph through school zones, and 17 items in the express lane at Safeway! Let’s do this!!
Sorry to burst your imaginary bubble. But 2018 Democrats will be the Majority because of you.  Why not protect the innocent children DREAMERs who never known any other country as Home except the USA. Nothing to do with illegal immigration.  Why not deport your immigrant wives
As a Democrat, I can guarantee that we will elect more Senators in 2018. While we're at it, we'll elect a whole lot of Congress persons to replace your corrupt party. Thanks for the great idea.
The people will fix this at midterm elections. Imagine what you can't do with less power.

Why is the WH sending Pence to the mid east?  To give him some  presidential practice That's why.

You, Trump, could use a good " Shut-Up" immediately,
this would fix the majority of our mess that YOU made!

You do realize this isn't working, right? You are a walking lie. A con. And any con will tell you your time is running out.

your Tweet was quoted in an article by @NPR
#SchumerShutdown2018 #SchummerSHUTdown really?
As you said in 2013, blame the President

And here we are in Jan 2018 with a government shut down. This was planned by Trump all along!
You will soon go to prison for long enough to spare the world your fascist nonsense right until the natural end of your disgusting life.
History will remember you as a bad example of character. You'll be named alongside Hitler, Stalin, Amin, Pol Pot, the worst of the worst.
@funder
@TheDemCoalition
I would think a #stablegenius like you, .@realDonaldTrump would know that, despite his claims of amazing negotiating skills, you failed to muster 51% of the vote.#TrumpShutdown2018
It's 60% for a very good reason, Spanky.
Well you got what you wanted, didn’t you?
You got your wish, Mr. President!
You would like 51 votes until you wouldn’t.
You got your wish with the #TrumpShutdown
Typical Trump business bankruptcy
Wouldn't have helped this time. 5 Dems "crossed over" & 5 Repugs voted no or didn't vote, so... Ask Barron how math works. 50<51 #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown #TrumpShutdown  #TrumpShutdown
MAKE SURE YOUR WIFE GOES WITH 
ALL THE DACA U TRYING TO SEND 
BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY'S BCUZ 
YOU ARE THE EPITOMY OF AMERICAN
CARNAGE
I know you missed this fact but the @GOP  control all three branches of government and still cannot seem to figure out how to get everyone on the same page to pass a spending bill.  You become a greater detriment to this country with every day you are in office.
Republicans are running this country into the ground and you are asking us to elect them again so they can continue screwing up? 
I am willing 2 bet, that there are an awful lot of people out there, whose children depend on "CHIP" & bet a lot have voted republican in the past. Not a lot of people believe that Dreamers should have 2 leave, they put a lot of $$ into our system. How much does your base put in?
Well @realDonaldTrump here it is! One-year anniversary of your inauguration and #TrumpShutdown is trending globally here on #twitter as a complete and utter #GOPFail but "good!"

I just marched #ally with #WomensMarch and the streets echoed #IMPEACH

#RESIST
OR elect more @SenateDems & @HouseDemocrats & send you bills to sign instead of weak @SenateGOP & @SenateMajLdr sitting around trying to figure you out & doing nothing & you’ve completely forgot about that bipartisan bill you rejected haven’t you? Better go see another doctor.
You're almost accurate for once. The #Resistance does plan to elect more senators. They will be blue, though, instead of red. Then you can whine about that.
Or IMPEACH worst potus ever!!

You that’s not gonna happen blue wave coming NOV 2018.
Be careful what you wish for.
You got what you wanted.
Becareful what you wish for Donnie!
This tweet definitely isn't aging well today.
Excellent you keep on top of this for the normal people and as to James Woods comments he is the biggest asshole that thinks he represents the majority- NOT!!!
Aww, diddums, did this tweet not age well? This is how we learn to watch our words. There's an old adage that what goes around comes around. Remember all the crap you accused Obama of doing wrong (like golfing too much)? Well, here you are making an even bigger mess of things!

If you do not want to be dominated by Putin and Russian Mafia  vote more Dems #RepublicanTraitors #TrumpLiarConman @realDonaldTrump @potus @whpresscorps @al @abc @cbs @nbc @foxnews @npr @nytimes @politico
You got your wish! #trumpshutdown
Shame on you. Your chorts and you are destroying us!
Your country needs a new President.
Dude that is so not going to happen we are going to turn the Senate and the Congress blue and then in 2020 you're going to be out on your ass to maybe sooner we might give you that wall four of them call the jail cell
We're going to fix all of this starting in November of this year,"shithole" and it ain't going to be with Republicans.  ALL OF THEM OUT!!!!.
we will elect more Dems and Independents- and you can watch from your jail cell. #Kellypuppet, #millerpuppet, #PutinsPuppet #TrumpShutdown
Vote Democrat. That's the people's party.  If you want the rich to be richer, vote Gop.
The two years that Pres Obama had Congress and Senate was used to fight for healthcare and the GOP did everything to delay/block other agenda like immigration. Then bad mouth ACA so the midterm election voted out Dems. Now the people love ACA.
Well, you got your #goodshutdown. I hope you're proud of yourself now.

Neither you nor the Republicans have a clue how to govern. Pity.

How soon before you stop wrecking everything that is good in this country and leave the WH? Soon, we all hope.
Whoops

either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good "shutdown" in September to fix mess!
There’s your “good shutdown” http://Mr.Deal  Maker
it isn’t the rep. Or the Dems mr president it is all You!!!
lul
eat crow!!
NO and NO!
Wait! So you're saying that you *wanted* the government to shutdown?  It's all so clear. You caused the government to shutdown and then you blame everyone else!
sounds like you got what you wanted #TrumpShutdown
please resign and invest in Mcdonalds in your home country of russia
Let’s be clear, this is the #TrumpShutdown. He wanted a shutdown, he caused a shutdown, he got his GOP shutdown.
What if...and this is a major change to policy, I know...but what if the Republicans put stuff in a bill that the Democrats also liked?
Not only that, but the Republicans are putting up roadblocks to the Trump collusion investigation. They know he’s guilty or they wouldn’t be trying to stop the investigation
You need to resign.  #TrumpShutdown

Don’t worry folks. Breaking news says that Mexico will pay for the shutdown. Believe me. And not many people know this, but morons will believe anything. This I can tell you.

#shitholepresident
#TrumpShutdown came true.
The House and Senate after Nov 2018...all coming for the Coward in Chief!!
Trump: "We need a good shutdown."- May 2017
America: "We need a good President."- January 2018
Well shithole you got your wish!!!! #trumpshutdown
Oh. So you are FOR  Government Shutdowns. OK. Gotcha.
#shutdown2018 #SchumerShutdown #TrumpShutdown #Shutdown #GOPshutdown
#trumpshutdown Oh, dirty Donald, the sharks are coming for you.
Need to get rid of the useless GOP starting with Ryan and McConnell.
#TrumpShutdown
If all Americans pointed a finger to strernly state "YOU'RE FIRED Donnie!" What would happen?
You sir are out of you're mind
One of the few times I'll ever RT this guy, but he finally got the #TrumpShutdown he's been wanting! @indivisibleden @indivisibleCO3
Since when is Chuck Schumer President. Neither side is at fault. YOU ARE! They were voting to kick the can down the road, not a resolution. It's your inability to make a deal that screwed this up. And your lies. IT'S YOUR FAULT!
You couldn't even get all the Republicans to vote to keep the government functioning. #WinningWithTrump #TrumpShutdown
A tweet for everything!!

It was planned ...
Please resign!!!
FAKE PRESIDENT....less Republucans in 2018. Restore sanity! Lock Trump up, lock Trump up...
This is all on you! #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump looks like your golfing weekend is ruined. #Sad #AreWeGreatAgainYet
Mr. President I just saw a video where a very famous billionaire businessman who had a hit tv show a few years back said that the President should be able to avert a shutdown.  I would love your take on that.
#WorstPresidentEver #trumpshutdown #loser #illegitimatepresident
@realDonaldTrump - You got what you wanted! #SHITHOLEPRESIDENT
And I guess then change it back to 60 once the Dems are back in control?  #TrumpShutdown
Hmmmm, Since you called for a shutdown this past May, this means you can stop blaming democrats.
You got your shutdown Mr. President.
I guess you got what you PLANNED
like an enema -- cleans out the #TrumpShit
Wow, what a sore winner. You are incapable of running (destroying) a country with control of both houses. You really belong on the short bus. But it will be the most excellent and shortest bus ever. A yugey short bus. #trumprussia
Get ready for the #BlueWave! The @gop and you have shown your inability to negotiate, support a democratic system, incompetence, hate, greed, and lead effectively. #TrumpShutdown! We are watching the actions of the @gop and you all are not doing well at all.
You made it happen.  See you for the 2018 elections!
You couldn't even get 50 republicans.
2 words FUCK YOU

No we are going to vote more democrats in you are responsible for this shutdown congrats. Enjoy your round of golf.
Now that we have a #trumpshutdown maybe you can actualize your brilliant plan, dotard.
Is this the part where you usually declare bankruptcy with your businesses?  Don’t think for one second people forgot about this tweet. We haven’t.
God forbid you should lead the country. Your choosing to sit on your ass and hope for change. Change is coming, just not the change you were hoping for
Resign.
Our country needs you and your criminals GONE!
Happy now Doofus?  You got your shutdown. 
You are such a failure!  #LoserTrump
Remember this Donald Trump tweet???? #TrumpShutdown
Trump got his shutdown and cuts as requested!
Seats are flipping blue on local to national levels in districts that you won by double digits. Keep endorsing GOP candidates. You’re doing the Dems a yuge favor.
You're a failure at everything. #Resign
Blue Wave is coming!

Soon
So stupid. #TrumpShutdown #BlueWave2018 #DreamActNow
Or in January.
And now you have your wish, sir.
The government might be shut down, but the investigation isn't. You can't avoid the treason.
You don’t really understand democracy do you?
Well Dotard Donnie you got your shutdown. What's next?
