Ok let's all try saying the following.
"While Obama was POTUS, the recession ended and we had sustained job growth. That trend continues."
We are Proud of President Trump and his Administration for Working Hard to add  1 Million Jobs to the Economy. Like he said he would !

.@realDonaldTrump Please name a single piece of legislation you've signed into law that contributed to a single job added to the economy.
.@realDonaldTrump In fact the only jobs you've added to the economy are criminal defense attorneys.
You mean the legal team investigating the collusion.
I do not believe he won cuz of Russia. But my god, his stupidity triggered the special counsel for sure
Men in Kentucky that LITERALLY lost EVERYTHING are now going back to work. My President @POTUS  @RealDTrump2k16 did that ! That is a FACT
Really for illegals, refugees and terriorists
EVEN IF THEY WERE reliable...,(August 4, 2017; 16:06 EDT) #FOXnewsus #FAIL
What kind of jobs....is this fake new Trump keeps talking about!
Great job
Wages? Jobs for your base? Your arms are 2 short 4 a back-pat! Do u hear something? That's the Mueller train rolling your way! Toot! Toot!
Thanks to Obama!
Best president ever. Only liberals will disagree because they are brain washed to hate everything trump does 
Major job growth has been occurring in this country for seven years... This is a continuation of that.

Good job President Trump!!
Wait...
Go back to bed which is what I'm doing! #TweetLessSmileMore
Thank you Obama!
Jobs were increasing under Obama as well.
The real measure of the economy is GDP. According to the BEA, GDP 1st quarter was 1.2 % & 2nd quarter was 2.6%.  U R way behind what U 1/2
Seriously. 2.2 million jobs created in 2016. Drumph is behind that mark. #fakenews
And dump has had nothing to do with it, thanks obama.
You haven't followed through on the 10 bills you promised. https://mobile.twitter.com/brianklaas/status/893794955885506560/photo/1 …
How is the wage growth? That's right it has not gone up.
Can you please explain to me how Trump is responsible for this?  He hasn't passed a single economic law!
It's because he is a republican. HISTORICALLY, when a republican is in office the country fairs far better economically.
Bull!
Nice try (and lie) @KellyannePolls. This is Barack's work and you know it. #Resist #ResistTrump
Trump has passed zero pieces of legislation that would have any impact on the economy. This is all Obama. So, thank you Barack!
He's signed many executive orders removing Obama regulations.
Zero impact six months in on the economy. Zero. But keep telling yourself what you need to in order to justify your voting for this POS
Zero? So you're saying that DOW hitting another high is zero impact? And the 1 million jobs added? Ooooh okay
Fiscal year doesn't end until October. Trends continue to be under past president until then. If this holds in November, you can say it's T.
Market has hit many many records since the election. Fiscal year end or not pretty sure it has zero to do with the last administration
You literally have no clue on how these things work. Trump deserves no credit. Has passed no legislation or a budget. He's a fraud
Please educate me then. People r more optimistic about this country and the economy than they have been in years.
Thanks Obama!
All hail the Obama economy!!
No, only 210,000 were added. LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE!!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS so less than 200k, per month?
Thanks Obama! Even more jobs were added the same period last year. This is still Obama's economy. Trump hasn't pass any legislation
Shhhhhh.... you're on vacayyyyyyshun remember? I know it's rainy, but you must have "fans" @ the club to schmooze. Put on clothes & go!

These are fake jobs coming from Croatia and they're giving people fake Visas to work at BMW Mercedes they're paying $11 an hour
CNN will say it's because of Obama
God bless you Mr. President. #BarackObama
Great Job President Trump, make CORP taxes 15% and 10% tax for  dollars coming back. It's better to have 25% of a LION than 100%of a mouse!
Thanks Obama
Well if Donnie’s one fox and one friend says so, then... 
Thanks @BarackObama! 
promised us of 4%/quarter. So for the remainder of the yr, Whiny Donnie Con Man Trump U must have a minimum of 6.1%/quarter. Broken promise
Good morning Mr. President 1. We love u2.McMasters does not support your agenda3. Trust us 4. Please FIRE McMasters!
America's stores are closing. Why isn't that raising a jobs alarm? https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2017/0804/America-s-stores-are-closing.-Why-isn-t-that-raising-a-jobs-alarm … via @csmonitor
That's been the trend for the last SEVEN years.
Let me guess, the Dems are all here to claim how it's Bo success. Shall I remind u, Bo blamed bush for 6 years of millions of jobs lost...
Bush actually did lose jobs and it needed to be turned around. Trump took over an economy that was rolling. Big difference
Nooooo, the economy and jobs  sucked when Obama was in office.
Wrong. It sucked his first two years due to bush recession. Once o's actions took effect job growth was up every month for 6 yrs. #facts
No, after a recession comes an expansion period. Bo literally kept the economy on a leash with his massive regulations and massive spending
So obama gets no credit for expansion but trump gets credit for that continuing expansion?  That's not how it works.
Expansion? 1-2 percent growth? Expansion? After a recession? No, an expansion would be 3-5 percent true growth, not money infusion
You said there was expansion. Yes it was slow but it's still growth. Pt is o added as many jobs in 6 months last yr as trump claims this yr
How many embarrassments?
There is no number big enough, son.
True, and I'm sure ol' Donny never learned to count that high either.
I'm sure there is some left negative spin to this one...just wait.
Thank you President Obama
Liberal zombie....
You've been FOXED by Fox FakeNews for the misinformed!
Thanks, President Obama!
Less than PBO
Fake news about a Fake President and his fake job numbers.  Sad and Fake.

"I've never studied economics but Trump is responsible for the jobs growth in his first few months in office" -ignorant person.
No, he can not take credit yet...spoken from knowledgeable sales rep.
Not sure what you're trying to say here.
Too bad it's still on Obamas watch till Oct GOP
Which is to say, 200,000+ fewer than added at the same period last year. Sad. Failure.
Second too Obama

How was your WVa rally, dear?
And you know that 17 days in New Jersey are like at least two months. Kind of like dog years, in a way.
Is there 17 days worth of stuff to do in New Jersey?  Or will he just eat chocolate cake in front of the TV?
With Congress out on "vacation" for a month, and they refused to allow POTUS to make any appointments in their absence, WTF would you do?
Read the Constitution? Research people who are actually QUALIFIED for their jobs?  There's a ton he could do that doesn't harm the country

The key to bringing them down is the Foundation.
Job creation you had nothing to do with. Lucky for you, President Obama left behind a stable, growing economy at full employment.
Funny thing, last year during the same time period, quite a few more jobs were added than this year. That was during President Obama's term.
Plus, President Obama made the dead for most of the jobs that were added after he left office. He was a REAL President.
*... made the deal (not dead)
Oh he made dead too!  DrineKing
DroneKing*
Typo night

In no way RU responsible 4 adding the number of jobs equal to 1/3 of how much you lost the popular vote by.  which is 3MM by the way.
Trump is doing a great job. He will make America great again
#ThanksObama
They don't need all that money, they don't spend it all either!! Cut the loopholes and military spending, and watch the economy burgeon!
Too bad Obama was able to do better for the same time last year! LOVERS!!!
if only they paid a decent wage
Yeah ur right! Under Obama's administration! Stop taking credit 4 his success! U imbecile!
Said the official propaganda machine of Donald Trump
Once America Boots The mexicans And Keep The Arab Jihadist Out...The Stock Market Will Rise To 25,000. Watch And See. (:- )
Thanks @BarackObama !
Thanks Obama
@doedeer1664 100 percent postive you are , you want people to think your not a weak man back up what you say
It really gets me how hateful Washington politicians are they want to keep their own little fiefdom, McCain is a freaking traitor man.
http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/07/news/economy/obama-15-million-jobs/index.html … thanks Obama
How many lay offs?
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Of course @realDonaldTrump, @FoxNews and all the trumpnuts believe this is thanks to trump. Completely oblivious and willfully stupid. Wow.
still not as much as Obama in same period of his admin  LOL

Thanks Obama!
Jobs are growing at same rate in 9mo since election as 9mo before. Wages are NOT. Profits, Dow & UnEmp rate don't matter as much as wages!
This channel should be taken off the air!
Thanks to Obama
thanks to @BarackObama ur riding the wave he created. u did nothing
At this time we are still working under the 2017 fiscal budget which was initiated in October 2016. So thank you so much Real POTUS Obama!
Obama had 600,000 MORE in the same time period, jackwad.
Thanks Obama!!
Thanks President Obama.
I know! Didn't President Obama do a GREAT job! He gets credit for higher #'s this time last year, roo. He is such a wonderful, caring man :)
Should be higher based on what Obama did but looks like @POTUS had some negative impact. Thank goodness for incompetence, could be worse
 Fox News 
HAHA! FAKE NEWS. My god, what a joke Fox is. I love how they ignored the millions of jobs Obama brought in .
Says Faux News.
Total nonsense not@hing to do with Trump but based on t@ge policies of Obama, but the fix news is the propaganda wing of Trump government
So this is what it feels like to be loved by our President his Adminstration @potus @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #MASA #TrumpTrain #DTS #LockHerUp
And we have Obama to thank for that, not you, you orange disaster. #IMPEACH!
Had absolutely NOTHING to do with you!!! Get real!
Fake fox nonsense. The factless station with the factless 45. Viewers iq in the negatives. Those left. Numbers dropping. Drip drip drip
Thanks @BarackObama - this is because of you!
You are writing the job-creating a wave of Obama. And his July report was better than yours.

Imagine if Trump was the president during last recession. We would have been toast. Obama built and Trump is claiming another man's glory.
And these million jobs are due to which of Trump's economic policies?

*crickets*

Right...he hasn't passed any.

#ThanksObama
179k/month under chump. 199k/mo under Obama.
Build the wall
Thank you, Obama!

Which averages 20,000 jobs leads per month than under Obama. 45 prays every night to be 1/10 the president Obama was.
Farewell Mr. covfefe.
We will miss you. Keep your organisation intact.
Produce your evidence to the public, Fox. These jobs are low paid, with low to virtualy no security. You should bury your heads in shame.
What kind of jobs?  Pay scale?  Benefits?  Part time or fulltime?  Where?  Facts are all we believe and not your boastful tweets.
yes, isn't that the pace of job growth for the past few years? Glad to see he didn't mess it up.
Growth in restaurants (25%), office (25%) and health (20%)
Zero in mining, O&G and manufacturing
What's DJT got to do with it?
Trump has had zero impact on job creation! This is all Obama and you know it!
Actually that's worse than Obama did for same period, just a year earlier....
Actually President Obama added more jobs in the same time period last year
You are detestable.
Yes, Obama did a great job! considering Trump hasnt even passed a budget yet.  He can't take credit for any of this.
How many were lost? That never seems to be in equation.
But Trump files for H-2 visa foreign workers to work at his resorts. Americans can't do the work well enough or cheap enough.
Thank you President Obama for starting this economic trend 8 years ago.
And this is less than the 1.5M jobs added in the same time period last year.  Sad.
But less than was added in the same time period by Obama.

Preparing for the disaster --> Republican Shadow Campaign for 2020 Takes Shape as Trump Doubts Grow https://nyti.ms/2utUMjq 
Of course, this are facts we didn't see in the Dutch #MSM, neither in the #EUSSR. We are blind lost reality
That is baseline. Nothing to brag about
Thanks Obama
Thanks Obama!
Why did all these Trumpies join Twitter in 2015? Oh, silly question. Sorry I don't have a Cyrillic keyboard so it would be easier for them.
Reagan added 2 1/2 million jobs steadily for 8 years, (not like Obama who merely recovered 2 million per year). See if U can beat it! #MAGA
That's great, but still less than Obama did.
Thanks, Obama
Thanks to Obamas policies and leadership, not like the clown we have in the WH now

@realDonaldTrump 
Job growth is lower under Trump, 1,074,000 first 6 months '17, 
than under Obama, 1,246,000 first 6 months '16. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/893570253388730369 …
It's actually a slow down in job increases. But slow down are still much better than downturns. Don't believe all the hype from any D or R.
Watch and learn. http://stevenrattner.com/interview/msnbcs-morning-joe-putting-trumps-economic-claims-in-context/ …
Woohooo! This liberal is wealthy! Thank @BarackObama ! #Lazyboy
Something that obama seriously lacked...he nither had the will nor the brains to do this amazing job, and Trump is just getting started.
Why is it all you seem to care about is money. What about the rest of us you are hurting or trying to like the Transgender and other LGBTQ.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS
thank goodness @realDonaldTrump is incapable of undoing the @BarackObama policies. #winning
And now due to you Mr trump the market is dropping like a stone GOOD JOB
Not like he created these jobs or did the Trump corporation create 1 million jobs
Are they high paid or family supporting or even Union caliber jobs. All minimum wage? 29 hours a week? Ins for workers? NOT!
Well some independent investigators, prosecutors, attorneys...
You're so ridiculous.
Same thing happened last year at this time. No biggie...
Your Transgender policy is unAmerican!!
I'll bet he didn't even thank Obama for leaving him a thriving jobs market. #rude #CoatTails

That's nice. Not a record, but nice.
Lies, Lies, Lies from #FakeNews shared by #FakePresident 
Thanks Obama!
FAKE FOX NEWS!!! ITS THANKS TO OBAMA!!!!!
Obama had more this quarter last year....
This is still under Obama's watch.
This is Fox. Just like Trump. No resperct for women.
THANK YOU to a real PRESIDENT! PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!! #ImpeachTrumpNow #loser #FakePresident #Resistance
Thanks President OBAMA!!!!   Maybe by October the Orange Buffoon can have any legislation passed to have results like Obama.
Only 170,000 fewer jobs than were added under President Obama during the same period last year.  So you get full credit for slower growth.
The fact that 96  of those 101 positive #jobs growth lines belong to Obama is #fakenews.  Ignore them #resist # grand jury #fbi #impeach
If you want to catch up with 7 presidents who have done better than you, better hurry because Mueller.
Feb-Jul 2016: 1,246,000 jobs added
Feb-Jul 2017: 1,074,000 jobs added

President Lazy Boy @realDonaldTrump is Sad!

In Obama's last six months he also generated 1,084,000 to Trump's 1,064,000 still not hitting Obama marks
Jobs restored, economy roars, thank you Mr.Prez.
Heil Drumpf!  Let's start arresting members of the lugenpresse! All hail our infallible leader!
THANK YOU @BarackObama.

Fox News wants tRump to get the credit, but America knows the truth.
Thanks to Obama's policies enacted before trump that led office ...
#IMPOTUS
Many jobs but the usual stagnant wages , only the very few & rich will benefit from Trump agenda. Still need minimum wage law to survive
but @POTUS told us those numbers are all lies. They're just numbers given to politicians.
you cannot take credit for this...you will lie about anything and I'm sure you could care less. con man
FAKE NEWS that would be in the past year and growth is dropping off fast. #FireHannity
What about all the people working in brick snd mortar stores loding theirs?
Now the rest of the story.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for all that you do for ALL Americans !!!
