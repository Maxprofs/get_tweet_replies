Thank you so much, guys!
@usairforce thank you for all of your hard work!
Soldiers are always ready to go where there is a need. Our National Guard could even function alone. Trump left our people abandoned!!!!
You can always count on the Air Force to go big or go home. Great job AF
A little marketing campaign will not save your butt. You have killed Americans! Late, Donnie, Late!
@telaqueen, you post a pic of @POTUS golfing and he is the hardest long working President in history. Should be ashamed!
Worse yet, he can't seem to figure out when golfing makes him look bad.  Crisis?  Don't golf.
The more you attack,  the better he is! But I get really sick of fake news!
You do know Trump is an expert at deflection, don't you? FOX/Breitbart, etc are creators of fake news & conspiracy theories. Google Hannity
Democrats are master deflectors, pushing fake narrative!

President Obama didn't wait to help. Donny is looking for optics before helping.
#WorstPresidentEver
He looks like he really wants one of those bottles
The greatest military in the world, and still filled with generosity. Thank You Air Force and all of the armed forces. We are blessed.
Now that it's been a week, Trump is interested in Puerto Rico. Actually, he's only interested because everyone knows he is doing a bad job
How stupid! News not covering how Unions have stopped non union volunteers from helping! PR was a wreck before the storm. It's exposed now!9
Are you serious? Unions telling people not to help because they are not paying union dies?
*union dues.
Look at the example of Texas. They took care of themselves and each other. The Fed's are not the answer. Non self sufficient dems in PR
Government has never been the answer to solve problems. It's up to the community.
Thank you for doing that. Click and Scroll. Everybody link back to this, my account, and my tweets:

But if we keep doting it out like your own bank account it goes dry
I love the Air Force. 
I hate lying Trump.
We love U & command your job, but the help is late & U know better that we do. We see the people suffering & talking no water, food, med
@realDonaldTrump Just stop!  Resign and let our country heal.
We're healing from damage @BarackObama inflicted quite nicely. Thank God daily for @POTUS. Be gone
You're funny!
I don't get the joke, she's being serious.
I was being sarcastic.
So was I, with you.
I don't get it.
Thank you
Make sure that the governor Rossello and Carmen Cruz not put their hands on it they will never get the food or water..

Meanwhile @CNN is spreading fake news about you attacking the Mayor why is @CNN trying to hinder the help for Puerto Rico??
He did a good w/ Texas & Florida, but fell short with Puerto Rico & the Virgin Islands. 10 days & no food, water or gas beyond San Juan.
Oh come on always criticizing sometimes Congress and Senate take their time approving funds etc.. Help is their ok
He's the commander in chief. He can send the Navy and Coast Guard. He's a racist and PR can't vote for him. That's why.
The coast guard is there. Supplies are there. Quit watching fake news.
Quit listening to the fake president. The mayor said he's a liar. I believe her over the known liar in chief.
I'll believe pictures and video over her. Trump isn't in charge of local response. The people on the ground are.
You believe a self proclaimed fraud over the woman on the ground? You're part of the problem then.
@POTUS Trump isn't perfect, But he's a very good Man who loves the USA.
Those who attack his character have proven themselves the most vile.
But its ok for the President to attack people? Typical Trumptard
Who has he attacked?
He literally went to a rally and called players "sons of bitches". Idc if u agree/disagree with the protests, he attacked them.
He did not attack them, he made a factual statement, them players are attacking and insulting the US national anthem.

#StandForOurAnthem 
He called the sons of bitches. The only fact made was that they were kneeling during the Anthem. Everything else is a divisive opinion.
Everything I said is a fact, not an opinion.
You think the protest is disrespectful, I don't. Opinion.
Doing a great job! Ignore the MSM!!
MSN? His tweets show what a moron he is.
So he can't make a mistake? He's human too.
I beg to differ. Every "mistake" is calculated to divide the U.S.  Human? He's the worst kind. Wake up!
It was a freaking typo, is that what it takes to conquer & divide? Apparently so! Snowflakes need to grow up.
Donald  this is an indicator if USA  Electrical Grid takes a hit , wake up Washington be Proactive in our Security of Boarders Infrastructur
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXEMPLARY SERVICE EVERYWHERE! YOU ARE APPRECIATED, LOVED AND PRAYED FOR. YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE!!
This is disturbing RE: delivery of supplies being stopped in P.R.

Thank you for helping and thank you for sharing.
off we go into the wild blue yonder


#WorstPresidentEver

So Lebron and all the other athletes are saying Trumps words and actions are divisive.  To dumb to see the hypocrisy.
#NFLBoycott #usa #nfl 
Waste of taxpayers money. PRhas never helped American citizens. Stop al foreign aide, demand payment for our military, or all our aide for c
Good job Air Force!! Making America proud
Yeeesss
You all are doing an amazing job! It is claimed San Juan hasn't had anything other than outside donations. I declare BS! Do you have pics?

Thank you USAF 
Who is paying for all this?? I already know the answer I just want you to think about it,Thank you #HesmyPresident #AirForce oh and Mericans

The haters say that is staged
If the left, Democratic's, the actors guild and news media would stop complaining about others and put their efforts into helping the people

Don't let the #MSM steal your thunder! Thank you.
Delusional Donnie didnt care about Puerto Rico American citizens until he got bad reviews!
Now he uses military to puff himself up!
#Failed
You wish that was the truth but dep down you know you are wrong,
Racist Delusionai Donnie displays public animosity to people of color daily & has his entire life, taught by his kkkDaddy & pimpGrandaddy!
Personally, as a woman of colour I choose to live my my own standards not by someone else's. Victimhood is overrrated and pathetic.

 good job 

I want to volunteer to help in Puerto Rico with you guys. How can i do that?
This is Carmen Yulyn. Did Melania was doing something like this during hurricane Irma in Texas?
But we want everything done for us.
What about PR

Lol. Yes. What a sensitive #broflake that requires his golf course safe space to tweet from while not doing any actual work. 

Very disturbing that DOJ and Sessions are not taking any action in the IRS scandal. Message to all bureaucrats: Do your worst. #loislerner

Mayor of Puerto Rico in San Juan is part of the problem. Trump lashes out at her because she is a failed leader!!!
https://twitter.com/Kingjames8289/status/914139698305658881/video/1 …
God bless each and everyone of you and thank you for your service
More thanks than words can express to USAF. But, who held them back? Why were people in Puerto Rico seeing all the supplies at the airport?
Judge Jeanine asked Jason Chafetz  about Eric Holder.  Sessions says he's not going after Holder, the IRS and not going after HRC's emails!
But the piss ant ungrateful mayor must be blind deaf and dumb.Oh wait, she was met with an entourage of liberals to assist in vomiting lies
@realDonaldTrump 
Thank you for your service
Ty Air Force, working to help the people that are on strike and not willing to help themselves ..unbelievable
This is what we do!!!
WTG AIR FORCE PROUD OF YOU
Very proud of our Airforce! 
#MAGA
LOL
I see improvement in getting it to PR.  I don't see any in distribution once it arrives on shore.  What's you plan?
10 Days Late! Obama had Help Day One
Thank you Men & Women for your Service and for all you do for all of us, I Salute You - Stand for National Anthem -Support  our President
Wow tremendous amount of help Puerto Rico  must be thankful
You are doing great. Now tell Lying Donald Trump to send some truck drivers over to P.R. so the ppl can get these supplies.
That is a FAKE PICTURE
all doing their very best...
#TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #trumpsawhitesupremacist #fucktrump #RacistInChief #WhiteNationalist #BIGOT #TrumpRussiaCollusion
I have vip AF pilot in our family doing this. Bravo.
America is so sorry that our amazing USAF has such a weak commander in chief.  Hopefully he will resign soon.
Bravo Zulu those Men
You're late #fakepresident
Thank god the military is finally there
Must be photoshopped, @CNN tells us no one is helping them.
I know right! LOL
Thank you
Seems slow. I hope we can defend the nation faster.
To @MSNBC & @nbc Please report on how the @usairforce and other military branches are doing GREAT work in their relief efforts in PR!
Kneel before Zod!
Really impressive, for all I know that could be the back end date f a storefront in Queens! Stop tweeting simply because you're bored!
@LeBatardShow seems like we are helping, no? Maybe I’m just not understanding your complaint/genius/point here.. @Stugotz790 you get it?
Get me my fucking help please
FEMA IS GOING WITHOUT SLEEP TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT THEY CAN. THIS IS BULLSHIT! YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY GETTING WRONG INFORMATION.
Step it up.....
Great job #USAF #HurricaneMaria
I though the MSM and Mayor of San Juan said Trump wasn't doing anything.
Just Drop It on that sorry of a Mayor . accidents do happen I call it predetermined Karma.
" up we go into the wild blue yonder
Flying high into the sky"
How many days did it take? #45 u could have scored huge. Another missed opportunity.
They should be off loading a fresh water processing unit instead of branded bottle water. Far easier to make on site than ship.
Go #USAF!

Fake news
Awesome

THANK YOU!!!! GOD BLESS YOU!!

To be clear, this is the mayor of San Juan who he insulted. She's using a bullhorn to find people.

They will say you never came but I say God Bless You and all our military!
You go Air Force 
How come the news networks ain't showing this, we need to go after these fukes next! Vigelante justice works!
A REAL POTUS/CIC WOULD HAVE HAD EVERYTHING READY TO GO, AS SOON AS MARIA PASSED. 
@BarackObama WOULD HAVE! #2



.@realDonaldTrump-Not NEAR ENOUGH 10 DAYS late! Many suffer-die! No airlift, clear roads, field hospitals, fuel & temp infrastructure day 2?
Maria hit Puerto Rico on my birthday-Sept 20th.
USA Military didn't show up for 3 days.
They only set up 3 sites.
BRAVO-CLOWN IN CHAOS!

@realDonaldTrump Old video from other disasters.
How about extending a big thank you to the men and women of our military who are protecting our country AND aiding hurricane victims!

The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina. There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.
Thank you so much again for your service 
great, but how many days did it take? WTF? Inexcusable.
Very good. I know they r helping, which is more than ur doing! We'll bring you a case of water for drinking, cooking & hygiene for a week!!!
About fing time!
Somebody help POTUS with his history of WWII, since his WH is flopping at figuring Kelly's Heroes.  Name, Allied WWII fighter-attack plane:
It's NOT fake news-Americans in Puerto Rico,the governor & mayor r all still begging 4 help!It's NOT fake news-We're r reading your tweets!
@realDonaldTrump Military is Americas finest!. Love you all!
#KurdistanBlockade
Meanwhile, Pappy is tweeting smack from a golf course. @DonaldJTrumpJr #Leadership
I see the supplies, but they don't make it to the people who need them.
I'm surprised you could actually find an available plane, I figured all were in use by your cabinet members.
Our military doing what our president can’t do. They are helping Americans!
Trump is unfit for office. #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign #resign
Here comes the government propaganda.
Finally trying to play Catch Up!

To be clear, this is the mayor of San Juan who he insulted. She's using a bullhorn to find people.
