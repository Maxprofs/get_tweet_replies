You are such a goddamn idiot.
No one will benefit except you and your dipshit family and other 1% assholes.
If this is how liberals talk about  the POTUS, they need to get out of America. PLEASE leave, this country is too good for you. Get out!
Just locker room talk.
That's right Margie - just locker room talk. The same locker room talk that You gave Donald a pass and overlooked. Remember?
Duty to country, not party/president.
Ben, Bindu and John...thank you!! Rocking responses! 
Trump and GOP have created a hostile political environment. Now the Conservaflakes want to cry foul when it's hostile towards them.
Awesome. Thank you you for looking out for the billionaire class, Sir!
Btw: taking healthcare away from 20+million Americans just to give rich people like yourself a tax cut is shameless - but ballsy.
I'm middle class and my Obama care is 600 a month more than 1 weeks pay check really? I need a dam break ..
It'll be super cheap once you can no long get insurance. 

See Unca Donnie is looking out for ya.

/s
It's not Obamacare it's your state. I have Aca and my premium is a lot cheaper and I'm 63 and still working.
It is also congress not approving the funds required.
Yup.  They sabotaged it.
The rich will get richer...and the poor will get a MAGA hat and a free button at your rallies.
I made your tweet more accurate as well...
You win the internet today!
Here is one maybe the #MAGA will believe seeings as it came from FOX. The tax cuts are for the RICH!
Thank you for all of your hard work, sir!
FBI: We're here to investigate a crime.
DNC: No
FBI: OK
For all who say #SethRich couldn't be the DNC source:

You know you hit a Liberal nerve when they start commenting on your post ..Dem corruption runs deep & they worry it's going to be exposed

All you do is lie lie lie.
You are a Joke of a human being.
Go back to Russia where you are welcomed
You didn't seem to healthy this last week.
1/ Since you can't walk 700 yards - it seems that the job is taking it's toll on your health. Alternatively Doctors report was a fabrication
2/ Either way before it's too late 4U the best course of action is 4U 2 submit your resignation 2 spend remaining time U have in comfort
3/ YOU know that it makes sense so do it right now! YOU DON'T LIKE THE JOB and it is  KILLING YOU so just give it UP
Well let's think about this if it kills him at least he would be gone
It felt so peaceful for a fleeting moment. Can we just leave him in the middle of the ocean?
May he ride off into the sunset via a golf cart, and never to be seen again.
How about he just drinks a gallon of radiator fluid and calls it a day?
All that steak and extra ice cream should do the trick.
Alzheimer's patient's frequently #Sundown at night: having delusions and being disoriented. We see this frequently. Send help!!
My mother had Alzheimer's. She made more sense than him on her really bad days
Big benefits to all (rich people, that is)!
Your son in law called. He needs bail money.

I don't believe anyone was speaking about HRC. The conversation is about Trump and his tax reform. Get with the program

I've read your timeline. You're a gullible idiot who has been conned by   #fakenews lies & you're too fucking stupid to fact-check anything.
English man , what's your business here ?
You may not mind if incompetent assclown @realDonaldTrump destroys America but the rest of the world cares about him destroying us as well.
And how much will that raise the national debt? 
Pshhh who cares about debt?!?
Just declare bankruptcy! Problem solved!
Attaboy!!
Exactly! We have to cut spending drastically. All cuts are making dems hostile. They don't have a plan for reducing debt either.
I was being sarcastic. You are talking about cutting things from the budget while growing defense. It makes zero sense anywhere outside USA
Unless the country is at a higher risk of needing defense. ie: N. Korea, ISIS etc. We can still cut other things.
You have no idea how much we waste on defense do you?
What about claiming property tax you fuck
Imagine being this disrespectful
Like suggesting he was born in another country? foh
How are you even verified. I contribute more to the world than you're biased tweets ever will
Who are you?
An American citizen who supports their government regardless of who's in charge
Regardless of what they're doing it seems too
I didn't like what Barack was doing but didn't call him a fucj
Nope just the wealthy.

Its hard 4 a troll 2 understand that
Might wanna look in your own backyard for those white nationalist extremists. They're far more of a threat lol
You must have flunked math.
Appoint Gianforte as press secretary
what about Tomi?
She's going to run the US Meat Dept with @scottlincicome as her assistant
I'm Deputy assistant meat secretary
Pin this tweet
Never!
Congress is in charge of the budget. You know that? And you won't get your cuts unless you throw 23M off their insurance. You know that?
I feel ya but I get why they're ornery over obamacare
Repair don't repeal.
I know, im for it, but playing devil's advocate I can see why conservatives are not willing to be reasonable
I'm hard pressed to recall the last occasion the GOP was anything even remotely resembling "reasonable."
Idk I'm not that old, maybe before Bush 2 Iraqi Boogaloo but idk
Yes, there was a time. Old enough to remember when both parties had moderates who worked together.
Me too. #CountryBeforeParty
Tax cuts for the rich! What a champion of the people we've got here, folks!
Feel free to leave the country liberal elitist
Elitist for not wanting the wealthy to get tax cuts and for all citizens to get healthcare? Howzthat work?
You have a plan for healthcare for all? Didn't think so. You going to start writing checks?
Lemme answer. I do have a plan & no, I wouldn't personally write checks as that's not how single-payer works. You'd pay less than now tho.
Oh so you're a socialist. Got it.
Yes, I want you and your daughter to not worry about being able to afford medical care. I'm quite the monster, I know.
No one believes this...
You RINO
It's what I've been reduced to.
#AmericaFirst 

Thank You
The Greatest Jobs President @realDonaldTrump
MAGA

#TrustTrump
President of the people @realDonaldTrump
Bots are going crazy. POTUS giving it back to middle class?! What a concept!
Libs don't understand how POTUS could be ahead of schedule, as they work at very slow pace. #MAGA

Easy to criticize. What did the left accomplish to help middle class?! #MAGA
And yet you still haven't addressed white power radical terrorism - why?
There is no race for terrorism, just terrorism that's it.
You, @DeDimacrow, tweeted a typo and could post “got [their] own party” instead. ‘There’ doesn't belong to ‘them’; ‘their’ does.
Oh, Donald. You know that your budget was dead on arrival. Impossible and ridiculous and incomplete. Americans know this, too. Nice try.
I would be shocked if he even knows what's in it. Seems like that Mulvaney guy just did whatever he wanted.

Capital letters don't make you sound more convincing.
Lolol to him it's a substantial difference! 
And by "to all" you mean "to all your friends".
Just the ones stuck up his ass.
It's so nice of you to cut school lunches so that billionaires can keep more their money.
And have lunch for two at swank restaurants in the approximate sum of 350$ a pop.
Ahead of whose schedule? You said you would get this done within your first 100 days - which has come and gone, with nothing to show for it.
Yes! Those koch brothers need their tax cuts
And his son in law.
He'll have bigly attorney fees.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy....
'Big benefits to all my billionaire friends...'
Ya Pelosi waters Clinton sanders are all.in that tax bracket
and they said they would rather pay more than have the middle class do so. That's leadership not liarship

Garbage in a good way or a bad way?
These recent tweets make me think we may have just read the same article:
you're literally cutting benefits with your tax plan you clown
America's 200 wealthiest people will save $560+ Billion because of your corrupt tax cuts! Just a Big gift for your Rich friends & family!
Do you remember what it felt like to tell the truth?
Hell no, he hasn't told the truth since well past the 80s
You sure are quick when that new tweet-lawyer leaves the room.
...who happen to be billionaires or own huge corporations...

Nope. Just the clown in office.
I could be.
And I am woman.
Even Presidents who win the popular vote and avoid obstruction of justice charges don’t get their budgets passed. You know that. Right?

Only to the rich
All these tweets. They must have given you your phone back.
Good. 401ks could use a corporate tax cut.
"Big benefits" if you are in top 1-5 percent. Rest of us eat crap.
What Benefits? You just Cut
1. Medicaid ($600 Billion) 
2. Food stamps for poor ($193B) 
3. Student loans ($143B) 
Only Rich got the benefit
You mean all rich people, right?
BEEF STEW
Okay.
The one that double counted $2T and fucked over a ton of people to give lots of money to the super rich ?
Sanchez....no need to say anything more. The name speaks volumes!  Hasta la vista!
Another Conservaturd Trumptard Racist, aren't you Betsy?
Not yet. The Mets are still ahead by one -- Mets 2. Bucs 1
Big benefits to all!
Mr President, I read that you consistently block haters, I do to. I think you should focus on your supporters. AGAIN, GREAT JOB OVERSEAS
AMEN R POTUS Trump MAGA
Your use of caps lock is moronic.
Is that why you want to illegally change the legislative rules to a 51 vote? You are an embarrassment to America. #Impeach45 #ImpeachTrump

by "all" you mean the wealthy. I feel for the poor people who voted for you, thinking they'd get something to make their lives better. WRONG
Doubt it You have only yourself in mind. Go back to Saudi Arabia, you seemed comfortable with the Radical Islamic Terrorists there
Big benefits for the wealthy only  everyone else, including veterans, paying for it 
Thank you Mr. President!!!   MAGA!
Don't let it hurt the poor and di
Diablo. Hurting. Make it fair
Disable
Kind of like your healthcare promise of not touching Medicare and healthcare will cover everyone #WorstPresidentEver #releaseyourtaxes #sad
your tax cuts are for the rich.
Troll
You have a computer. Why not use it to educate yourself?
You mean all your buddies, not the idiots that voted for you. I'm not one of them, TYG!
There isn't even a bill being presented yet. How is that "ahead of schedule".
Finally!
The beginning of the end of Liberal Tyranny.
#ObamasLegacy almost killed the country.
Still in critical condition.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS @BetsyDeVosED @BetsyDeVos @IvankaTrump @VP #goaway #Impeach45 #ImpeachTrump #notmypresident @EricTrump
YES!
We are sick of you. No more of stupid rallys. No more thugs Bossie/ @CLewandowski_ Really sick of you and all things mafia
Your not proposing any tax cuts.  You are moving taxes around and even increasing them.
Less tax equals lower prices money will go further! Lord Anthony
LIKE THAY SAY RICHER GET RICHER AND POOR GET POORER THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE THERE FOR US
That goes well with your plan to fix health care by adding more money to it (whatever that meant)
You are Delusional, spiteful & even worse, a liar. Not an altruistic bone in your body
LIAR! #Illegitimate #PutinPuppet
Let's see...border wall: nope. ISIS defeated in 30 days: nope. Healthcare: nope. Allies: nope. Muslim ban: nope. Muslim ban 2: nope. #MAGA
I'm sure there will be no benefit for anyone but you and your rich friends.
Tax cuts helps the wealthy. I'm a senior and it raises my taxes 20%!  You are a puppet for the .2% of 1% Koch Brothers, puts more on middle
Wait, let me guess, you have you in mind.... Wait, you said you were for us.....#Liar Liar # Impeach the crook
#Resistance
There is no tax bill moving through congress, but who cares about a tiny FACT like that?
Seadog , my man, calm down, or you could start a Kathy GRiffin fan club, lol. June 1st, the start of hurricane
Sherrif Clark is a true patriot. God bless America. FLOTUS is protecting her family and POTUS is protecting USA
Obamacare was a racquet, I've been going to a health clinic for the past 8 years.They have done nothing for me, just waiting for me to die.
LOL.  Now cutting programs for elderly and vets is a way to help.  What clinic is killing you?  Do you not qualify for ACA
I said waiting for me to die.  Not that they're trying to kill me.  Maybe you know something I don't know.  Either way  Obamacare  ducks.
And by all you mean all your billionaire mates. You've been doing corrupt deals for decades you can't see that it hurts the rest.
Big benefits to all... billionaires.
Except those who will be poorer and unemployed
Please explain how cutting taxes while increasing military spending will work out. You can't bankrupt a country so you need to explain.
Massive tax cuts for billionaires, like yourself, you meant to say. Not for middle class & poor. Your tax reform is a joke.
I hope those big tax cuts will be enough for me to pay my $13,000 Health Care premium.
You want more Health Care spending but u got massive tax cuts for the rich & for yourself u are deplorable Dead on Arrival as u should be
You have abandoned us, people voted for you, now after elected you oppose everything you were for, so disappointed, a 20 year Vet!
Your tax cut bill cannot even get 51 votes in the Senate.  Why are we discussing tax cuts when our deficit is through the roof?
You mean benefit you n your billionaire friends.
Thank you Commander-in-Chief for taking on this responsibility!! You came at the right time!!
- Bonehead - you haven't turned in ANYTHING except a one page "outline" with NO SPECIFICS - Ahead of schedule IN YOUR HEAD
Trump talks ass backwards wants more spending on Healthcare massive cut 2 Medicaid no pre-existing big tax cuts 4 self & Rich poor 2 Let Die
Sad news for you: If you capitalize something, it doesn't make it more likely to come true
It is not benefits for all & you know it. This tax reform is not for Americans. Its for the elite rich! #trumpreform #TrumpDocuments
Schedule was behind the 1st day when U couldn't find lights. Your game is 2 just make up shit. We'll get news from EU, G7, NATO, FBI, Intel.
by all you mean all that matter to you!  What ever happened to equality and fiscal responsibility? You'd bankrupt USA for personal cuts
Wow..moving where?
speaking of taxes - WHERE ARE YOUR RETURNS ? 
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING ?
What?  Have you become a comedian or do you just think we believe you? #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Keep Tweeting President Trump - I rather hear from you BEFORE the MEDIA begins to misrepresent etc
You are a #LIAR and have been known as a serial liar for decades. Your tax plan is for you & other 1%er's, not for all!
That's right
Bwahahaha! Free goodies!! Just click your slippers and wish it so!!!
Well, unless you are age 50-64, or go to school hungry, or want clean air and water.

@cspanwj #UniteBlue #humor #NotMyPresident
@realDonaldTrump Tax Cuts are needed but please don't allow our wild horses to be slaughtered. Please but a total end to it. Thank you.
All your 1%er friends will benefit, unfortunately working Americans forgotten again... #MAGAFA
Thank you President Trump!!!

Do they include the massive ones to #veterans?
End the waste of 100s of BILLIONS annually on welfare,etc. for aliens & call the savings Mexico's contribution to the wall building fund
Trump does not know what's going on in his administration does not read bills just thinks a win as if it were a baseball game gamble yours
Tell me, when you talk to your mirror, does it answer you?
                                LOSER
Littlehands,you can't stop lieing a can you! No we're not giving tax cuts to the richest of the rich of this nation!#NogolfNjail
The burden of preparing an income tax return takes a toll on my health.The tax laws are way too complex. Cut the budget> Abolish the IRS!
Tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires does not equal "big benefits for all." It means big benefits for very few.
Only benefit is to you and your friends #crookedonald. It will fail miserably just like you #notmypresident
I am very thankful for Donald Trump to be my president. God bless you
Could you explain what your understanding of the word "all" is?
If Mitch McConnell doesn't under mine you!!!  Had enough of the sorry Ass establishment stabbing you in the back
No benefits for me. Your cuts go to the 1%. #99%er #Putinscockholster
Mr President we love what you have been doing. Please help get rid of Ryan. He's NOT on your side. PLEEEEEASE. #WE STAND WITH OUR POTUS
You think you can buy American with your tax cut you are wrong!!!!
Donald, please help us win the Bogus lottery, We can't / won't pay taxes w/o income? 
these useless people, jobless/not from this country, sit here, botting out... if Trump left twitter, it would go out if business
LOL you mean that flimsy one sheet of paper that you submitted? You are a pathetic joke. #notmypresident
You screamed about a balanced budget. And now you BANKRUPT our nation!
And what will be the benefits to Donald Trump? #FakePresident #TheResistance #NotMyPresident
Bawhahaha he's a buffoon ..
Benefits ONLY to your rich corporate friends! No wonder you're in a rush, gotta buy all the loyalty you can ASAP. #impeach
Big bennies for top 1%! Nothing for middle class and u ripped of healthcare from Trump voters.  SAD!
The massive tax cuts/reforms are for the Rich.
Really? All wealthy people?? You are not trustworthy! Nothing more than a snake in the grass! #liar #fraud #taxevader #tiedtorussia
I'm glad we now have a real man the White House.
NoDonTheyOnlyBenefitTheRichest1Percent#WeAreTiredOfGoldenShowerEconomics
It isn't going any where because it is corporate welfare plain and simple. Like you need more money. Phoney paper cut out of a president
Sir, why do you feel that granting huge tax cuts to the wealthy is going to benefit the country as a whole?
ALL, SINCE WHEN ARE SENIORS, DISABLED, THOSE ON FOOD STAMPS, THOSE AT POVERTY WAGES PART OF THE "ALL"  WHO WILL BENIFIT?
Another lie from DJT. TRUMPTAX is ONLY abt giving wealth to wealthiest. NOT a reform, but transfer wealth to rich. Worst President!
Dead on arrival
Keep up the great work Mr. President.
What's REALLY ahead of schedule...Russia investigation and impeachment proceedings.  #TRUTH
Yeah keep screwing your voters! Good job! When we go into a recession under your watch let's see how many people stick with you?
Look at all these idiotic liberal trolls.
#alternativefacts please go away....
Trump is more of a bumbling idiot than when Abbott & Lou Costello does their script on who's on first no he's on 2nd Trump out too lunch
..big bens to your rich friends, maybe -- while I pay more than 1/3 of my $ in taxes, making a ? of what bill to pay a weekly occurrence.
Steal from the poor to give tax cuts to the rich. The opposite of Robin Hood. What does that make you? The villain??
By "all" and "tax cuts", you mean...oh, never mind.  
You don't realize.Maybe u do!Smart or dumb, you'reto MILLIONS. So...#Impeach45.See?
Actually, maybe not Smart or Dumb...it's probably more like Moral or Immoral. Same result.


Big benefits to the 1 percent/big nothings for the middle class and poor. You will be in the history books as the worst president. Resign!
Landing this tax bill will be yourD-Day victory!!!
Why would anyone want to vote for a Democrat when all they do is increase income taxes and destroy jobs.
Hey Donnie,  you could have just texted your friends this. It doesn't pertain to the rest of the nation. #SCROTUS
Wait... What tax bill? There's nothing moving through either house atm.
Who cares it will never pass
Someone needs to let Donald know his tax reform bill is already dead!
Oops your're on the brink of your 250 word vocabulary
No, big tax benefits to corporations and more national debt we the peons can have our tax money spent on. And no extra $$ to support O’care.
Why don'tyou just kill all sick,poor,old, &disabled people off. That's whatyou want anyway! #DAFFYDONALD
Senate needs to get off their butts and make this happen.
I understand your tax plan and if think it's fantastic but people just don't get informed and believe the fake media unfortunately
All the millionaires. Not all the tax payers.
YOU LIE!!!!
Resign
Another Trump Lie, just like Trump Care. Both Disasters for the Average American.
