Remember when Obummer said “you didn’t build that” to business owners.
Obummer didn’t mention that it was the Taxes on the businesses that built that.

According to you, you convinced Ford not to move their "Focus" plant to Mexico! Great...Now it's going to CHINA!
WRONG WRONG WRONG!  They're going to CHINA!  Good Job, Donald!  You're doing a damn fine job of #LOSING
I think Ford is probably the best stock I own.
LIES! LIES! That expansion was planned in 2015. You don't get credit for it.
We love  - your SMART play today.  Keep up the good work winner !
what did you mean when you said you would not be playing golf but work ,work work like flying to n.y. or Floriday wdekly
I just saw on tv that one car company was shutting down on 20,000 jobs
Fast forward to today: Ford announces they're cutting 10% of their USA workforce. Woopsie.
That's why I'll keep buying European and/or Japanese cars. Thank you very much.
Protectionism has never worked and won't work.   Cars will Become more expensive and break down more often.

Don't let your ego get deflated, But this had nothing to with you

Why is fords stock going down the tubes? Can you make ford great again please?
I'm proud of you Mr. President. Please keep pushing your agenda. And thanks for sticking up for O'REILLY!
Me too. I watched him every night for 22 years.
Too bad the car companies employ robots rather than humans. Trump leaves that out. Fool
Really?! I think you mean JO-.not really enough to add the other used car salesman ad pieces. Greasing palms only gets stay until automation
Thank you for making the sunrise as well

As a retired ford employee. I hate lies. Ford investment is going to retain or create 135 jobs.
Gracias Donald por ayudar a la gente a tener más trabajo y oportunidades ,,trabajo bien pagado para todos,  bendiciones

Great job hitting Assad hard thanks I support you 100%

Thank you Dr President.
they need those jobs to buy bottled water #GoodJob
Donald, we love you, you're being set up in Syria.  So is Assad.  Chemical attack is a false flag!  Don't fall for it.
distance  yourself from o'reily.
You can't really believe Pres Trump deserves the credit for this.
They announced that years ago bimbo baggans
Who would want to take any credit for things he lied about,  "you can keep your insurance"  for one!!
Did you like #March4Trump ?

BS....this was already in the works...nice try to take credit when your failing so badly!
Plans were all made my Ford last year. Wake up and stop taking credit for things you haven't done.
and you had nothing to do with it. It has been in the works way before you were elected . You're trying to claim it!!!
Thanks to OBAMA!! Ha ha. Everyone knows that was his deal. Is this the honesty you were calling out? Only losers take others credit.
great
YAY OBAMA
I sure hope I can get back to work!Obamacare killed my job in the hospital there were so many layoffs..... never got back
I live in southeast Michigan and I have news for you, the car companies never left. They've been here the whole time
rabenan bae mana karo kimcil
He did make IN the laughing stock of the country. I moved back to NY. My ex-wife had a TAPP on my phone
Why did you pick Pence when 3 plants were built in IN were relocated to Mexico? Did you miss that?
go Trump! From a Michigander!
Hope no Muslim get a job there
You take credit for something that was planned 2 years ago...ass
Obama had nothing to do with this fucking liars!
wo
Liar you are not responsible for that
This is incorrect or false.
Another example of Trump taking credit for something that was planned before he was president. -WP
Even Ford calls you out for such LIES.
Thank you President....we will give you the proper respect. We LOVE you! And thank GOD for you!

You WILL NOT take credit for this! President Obama brokered this deal!  Seriously! You should be ashamed!

There he goes gain-he's a liar!
unless you lower the burden on the middle class, it doesn't matter. Lower my taxes and my healthcare cost.
BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT
THE T-FORD IS BACK. GOOD LUCK WITH ALL 7 JOBS IT WILL CRATE...
Ford contradicts your claim to credit. This stuff was in the works for over a year.
You didn't create the job's they were already happening last year. Don't lie
Yahoo! Best news I've heard since the sermon in church this morning!
I voted for you President Trump, and you have yet to answer a single question I ask. I am a part of "We The People"  right?
Yes!
Amazing
Keep up the good work Mr President.
and this had nothing to do with you!
Old news being made great again by a pathetic, insecure, pathological, lying narcissist. O & he's USA potus. That's just incredible. SADDEST
Michigan
They never left idiot
great kpb
2 years ago and only 165 jobs and thousands of robots.
YES!!!  ALRIGHT!!!
That was already in the making when President Obama was in office.
p.stop hatred crime against indians
Continued lies by you. Deals were already completed and in the execution phase. Wrong to take credit for deals you had nothing to do with.
总统先生，来中国办分期啊
You can brag when it happens
Yep. JOBS JOBS JOBS initiated during OBAMA's term! 
Great news! Iowa Firefighters paying 1/3 of of pension to healthcare premiums... where is our relief?
Your taking credit for a commitment Ford made back in 2015. The lies never stop with you...SO VERY VERY SAD
Ford announced plans to upgrade some of its Michigan plants in November 2015 having NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
The Michigan plants had that moving 2 years ago its additional lines few jobs need a engineering degree? HUGE investment in Canada  JOBS
Do you just lie for the fun of it?
This was in place LOOONG before you were
Currently the unemployment rate is 4.7. During the Obama administration it reached 4.6, that's the goal to beat.
You mean what Obama already stated 2015 *yawn* you're a loser.
I'm a Ford man all the way.  Great news.
A plan in the making for years!
Why is ford moving small car production to Mexico.
This was negotiated between Ford and the union in 2015. Another nice try though.
We won!  We're winning!  TTT: Two Term Trump!! 
Trump O Nomics!  TTT: Two Term Trump!!
Trump Effect!   TTT: Two Term Trump!! 
This is huuuuuuuuge!!   TTT: Two Term Trump!! 
As Trump Flaunts Ford’s $1.2B Investment, Ford Says It Was Planned in 2015
Without Obama and bailout there is no U.S Automobile industry
Why is ford moving small car production to Mexico??
@AP_SgtFreefall If you are injured by an illegal alien in a sanctuary city you should be able to sue the city & the mayor.
they planned this years ago. You had nothing to do with it.
Go go go #maga
You forgot to give credit to the people who put this together during Obama presidency.
@Mrch4ScienceBOS @ScienceMarchFAL @ScienceMarchDC @ScienceMarchNY #ResistTrump March for Science April 22 @SenWarren @SenSanders @SenMarkey
3 Jobs?
Which you had absolutely nothing to do with, but thanks for sharing!
The car companies republicans wanted to let go bankrupt, the companies President  Obama saved? Those car companies?
Quit taking credit. Obama put that motion in action. It just fell on ur lap!
Bang up job there Skippy.
Thanks Obama!
Speaking of Michigan. Have you had a beverage from Flint? Tried to wash or take a bath there? Have you even heard of it?
That has nothing to do with you 2015
Democrat Jerseyville there from Satan
Thanks for your dedication.
You are working hard to make America great again.--
Cannot believe the angry media
The only reason they are doing it is because you gave tjem HUGE tax breaks that we are going to pay for.
yeah Obama did that.
TIME LIMITS ON ASSISTANCE ....SAY 2 MOS!  NO FREE FOOD OR WELFARE FOR THOSE ON DRUGS OR WITH FELONY.
Glad to see you know how to spell Jobs.. now get to work on infrastructure!
Mr Trump. The car sector was thriving under Obama and him saving the industy. Shame on you for trying to swoop and take the credit. Your MO!
Obama, Obama, Obama, thank you Mr. President this is your victory
