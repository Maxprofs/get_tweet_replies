Hey John, remember when he said he didn't like you because you got captured? What a great guy, right?
Do you get context? McCain called Trump supporters "dummies". Mod kept interrupting Trump.
Maybe watch the context before being played for a fool
Trump supporters ARE dummies. McCain is right. What else do I need to know?

Don't worry sweetie, it'll all be over soon.
Hubris.
and he still thinks you're a lousy soldier for getting captured..
uhmmm... McCain was in the Navy. Not the Army. Seaman, not Soldier.
he wouldn't know the difference.
Yeah.. Listen to her, she's an expert when it comes to semen..
no but I'm not a feminized male who doesn't know about the military
that's not a very nice thing to say about @realDonaldTrump
I'm sure he knows more than u. A hacker? yeah right.  Mum's basement doesn't qualify.
Again Donald, you exploit our heroes.  Where is all the money you promised our veteran organizations?
@LaraLeaTrump @SenJohnMcCain haha how did this work out for you Donny?
thank you John McCain for standing up to this predatory sociopath
i'm sure he really appreciated the comment about his capture as well.
might want to check back in with the senator
weren't you the primary candidate who dissed him for being captured???
STABBED IN THE BACK BY MCCAIN. FIGURES. ONLY OUT FOR#1 himself. Election is not over.
That was yesterday.
But now you hate him.... again!!!
@BigBrotherNoNo @SenJohnMcCain And yesterday McCain unsupported Trump. He is so loyal...not!
@ThePaulaJones @SenJohnMcCain You still thanking sen McCain who no longer supports you?
there are Obamacare policies that are great mandates.Exp preexisting conditions, incl young adults on parents policies, etc
McCain is a total traiter and asshole!!  Doesn't deserve any thanks. Fire the traiters!!
I thought you said he was a loser for being a POW.
@LaraLeaTrump @SenJohnMcCain McCain is a disgrace.Sold and bought throughout.Completely anti Trump."Thank you"? Rethink it.
and he turned on you SMH that's what career politicians do as they have done to American people for yrs
MEDIA RIGGED....
5 DAYS AGO TRUMP DID NOT MENTION YOUR SCANDALS IN THE PAST HE BRAGGED ABOUT YOU BUT U DEFEND MOSLEM OBAMA
So NOW he's OK?  a few months ago he was a loser for being a POW.  Which side of your face is speaking now?
That's why he dropped your ass! Lmao!!
WE ARE AHEAD IN HONEST POLLS. MOST POLLS OVER SAMPLE Ds & WOMAN TO SKEW FOR HILLARY #maga #vpdebate #trump
WE WILL CRUSH HILLARY & DIRTY DNC #maga #vpdebate #trumptrain #trump #clintonscandals
You certainly threw Senator under bus today when he couldn't support you after your many ethical issues.
did you change your thoughts on PTSD now?
was this before or after he tossed out his endorsement of you?
liar

Who are you kidding? You said PTSD is a sign of weakness!!!
remember when you said he wasn't a hero?
Remember when you didn't watch the context?
@YouTube LOL, what context? He said he wasn't a war hero. Period.
Oh that's why the vid I linked is 6 mins long.
Did you take your handkerchief?
cocaine is one helluva drug...
pay some tax
1 yrs tax return from 20yrs ago and you base the mans whole life on that.  who left Americans to die?
don't think McCain is listening anymore  or any of us for that matter WOMEN I mean
Do you remember when you said that @SenJohnMcCain wasn't a hero because he was a POW?
uhmmm... That is the MSNBC version of his comment. Not accurate. Typical of a Liberal to lie.
Did you just thank @SenJohnMcCain for the dishonest media?
no, Sen McCain just endorsed Trump, pay attention
not anymore
You're crazy & blind. He's MUCH better than HRC. Better looks & brain too.
remember when you said @SenJohnMcCain wasn't a hero cuz he got captured? #NeverForget #DraftDodger #NeverTrump
Remember when you didn't watch the context?
will turn tail if he thinks it suits him.
just sits on the fence. Americans problems are not his. Go Trump
he is a wise man and that is why he is not voting for you. #TrumpScum
will run at the first sign of controversy part of the establishment.
Thank you Sen. McCain for withdrawing support from Donald, albeit belatedly once it became convenient.
and now McCain has pulled his endorsement of your slime campaign
Today he throws you under the bus. Well DJT, U really crawled under the bus yourself. Taken down by a Bush.
I am sure @realDonaldTrump the women you have interfered with, have PTSD of their event, that you will never understand like @SenJohnMcCain
You were dishonest about PTSD
Donny, guess you're not thanking him now after he finally pulled support. You r disgusting.
LOL
Why would you care what he thinks? All he did was get captured right?
MC CAIN JUST WAITING TO REMOVE HIS WHAT EVER HE NEEDS TO RESIGN TOO OLD MOVE ON
And thank you John McCain for finally retracting your endorsement of such a horrid candidate. Fantastic haha
John McCain is not loyal and is an opportunist who is power hungry.  Time for him to retire!
Thank you Senator for pulling your endorsement today of this vile, vulgar human being.
that was right before he took back his endorsement
Just a reminder to Arizona voters coming November. Just 3 days ago McCain was rationalizing Trump support

I don't think you are welcome back Donald.
Coming from a man whom had disagrated McCain once a war hero down to a nobody of importance....
Thank John now, for #nevertrump
Traitor
...#awkward
@ThePaulaJones @SenJohnMcCain what a difference 3 days makes
I thought you didn't have any time for soldiers who get captured.
The same McCain that you criticized for getting captured in Vietnam, while you were sucking on a silver spoon?
.@SenJohnMcCain listens to the people and withdraws his support of @realDonaldTrump
Turn of events since then.
we love Trump
#floridanurseslovetrump
I bet this is the one time that the @realDonaldTrump wished the mic didn't work
Your move @SenJohnMcCain. I am an AZ conservative and your response to @realDonaldTrump in next 24 hrs will dictate my vote.
ptsd and the dishonest media.. You Michael Moore?
now it's the media that's dishonest. not the «grab by the pussy» thing, that's completely honest
Now say something nice about the media. Dare you!
is he a hero now?
now you want to talk well about John McCain?
dishonest for reporting the actual words you said? You need serious mental health help.
We'll all be suffering from PTSD if you get elected, you blustering spunk-trumpet.
You are the leader, God willing,
white female here still voting for you.  Just typical man stupidity with Billy Bush. Don't let Killary get you off message
people with PTSD are weak, remember
Thank you Senator McCain for forgiving, and being a pro-Trump force. He is the change America needs!
You were still rude to him and should apologize profusely
yeah john, nice spinelessness.  Did Trump try to grab your daughter or wives' p××××es yet?
isn't it that guy you once said was no hero because he was captured and tortured for over 5 years?
McCain has PTSD, that's why he's supporting YOU !
American Legion of NJ begged 4 hosp. & homes.Obama spent http://elsewhere.Mom  & cousin volunteer #veteranshospitals#PTS
did you talk about heroes?
Trump, do have any semblance of decency?! John McCain said nothing of the kind. What is your IQ? Maybe a 3.
@billsoltis ask Hillary what her job is and make her tell the American people the definition of it, ask Y she wasn't alert?
@billsoltis remind Hillary of our 4 elite men lost in benGhazi ask her what her job is? & Y she didn't protect them?
Donald Trump was not a politician 11 years ago twenty-five years ago give it up people he is a great man
@billsoltis just because u trusted a low life kid, with a secret, doesn't come close to Killory allowing Isis in r 

Watch "The Silence" a documentary w. the stories of 4 survivors of child abuse and sex trafficking:
Real Trump."Hitting on married women vile degradations demean our wives and daughters."Mitt Romney
too bad you didn't show much respect for him previously in your remarks. You don't care about vets.
fox showing disasters, they didn't show countries like Haiti holding signs asking Clinton's were there money
#Ne-Vah-Da
“He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren’t captured.”
CNN plays up what a terrible thing Trump locker room comments are.  Have they never been in a bar?

'....sorry about the hero thing......'   ?
he hates you
you like him now even thou he was captured. #donnysmallhands #fake
Mr Trump, I do not believe you meant the insult toward the senator! Please apologize!
. You should apologize to McCain if you win.If you lose,no one will care. But McCain will always be a hero.
You called McCain a loser. You're the real loser (or will be, soon).
Repeating YOUR exact words are not being dishonest or "attacking" you. #DonTheCon
Exactly! Trump can ONLY wish he had the smarts, bravery and character of a McCain.
no body likes u donald trump
@DianneSteiner @SenJohnMcCain The ONLY dishonest ONE, is YOU!
what abt Hillary committed Treason
John McCain,why are 22 Vets a day commiting suicide?Vets have to wait 7 days to 7 months for treatement?
Obama CUT $800 Billion from Medicare,stole it from people who have worked all their lives,to fund Obamacare.
a veteran war hero endorse @realDonaldTrump an artful draft dodger who evades paying taxes for POTUS?
two greats that see the big picture. Butt hurt bushes and kasek are pride over party. Bye bye
I am so tired of dishonesty and media helping to cover it up
Nice!  It's time to stand together all True RNCs. Winning in Nov Mr. T
Maybe u should apologize to Sen McCain for theisrespectful things u said about him being a tortured POW.
McCain betraying his brothers and sisters by supporting accused child rapist Donald Trump.
You @realDonaldTrump are the one who stomps on small businesses
@Trumptbird Thank you @SenJohnMcCain & Thank you @realDonaldTrump 4 thanking McCain Lets come together & win this election! #LoveTrumpsLove
my husband stepped on a mine in 1952, he still runs and fights in his sleep, imagine the horrific experience
#ManyPeopleAreSaying you called McCain a loser, remember. People who got caught were not heroes, you said
It really is irresistibly appealing, just how dangerously ignorant you are on just about everything.
McCain is my friend until this election is over.
now you thank him after saying he is not a hero. You are a fraud and conman
Mr. Trump's Rally yesterday in Henderson was fantastic. I've seen people registered to vote.
Thank you that Republican party is uniting. We need Trump Pence 2016!
McCain 
Fool me once shame on u 
Fool me twice shame on me
I no longer respect you
You no longer deserve it
MEDIA dumped on Hillary in 08 and is making up for it now... Sadly we are might get ANOTHER Obama.. sighh
McCain used to be 1  of the few PUBLIC SERVANTS
 I held in high esteem. 
NOT ANYMORE! 
1st Palin
Now Trump
This issue means alot to me. I have a vet that was in Iraq. I come from a military background. Our Vets NEED OUR HELP!
Mr Trump stop over medicating veterans
they could get more Drs & b seen earlier R they getting kickbacks !
is this before or after you insulted him and his service #NeverTrump #TrumpNazi #deplorableDon
glad to see republicans coming together for the cause #NeverHillary
#WhatAboutBob
my boss says you no hero , captured
Interesting contrast. And #McCain never denounced #Trump for it either. #MAGA http://cbsn.ws/1gGNQJ1 
So John is a hero again, thought you said he wasn't a war hero bc he got caught? shame on you John, Shame.

why do you insist on pissing of vets?
Why @SenJohnMcCain would speak up for you after you insulted him is beyond me! How much are u paying him? #AmericaIsGreat
thought you didn't like John McCain cause he was captured
latinos want school vouchers, jobs, lower taxes for small businesses
#ImWithHer
Obama Care was always a path to single payer socialized medicine!
Drop out Don and make America great again!  #DumpTrump
Well done Senator. Dispelling biased media reports. Good luck in Arizona.
, have you apologized to @SenJohnMcCain  yet?  He has more class than you ever will.
Now your trying to be nice to McCain after you tried to disgrace him! Trump you are a Deplorable Nightmare!
I recently recommended you challenge Hillary on her source of earnings.  Your son Eric did. Now I say give Bernie a call
maybe it's time for you two to bury the hatchet. We must stop Hillary.
too bad it couldn't come from a REAL war hero eh, Donnie?
your learning, your learning. Keep making allies. Xo
The same John McCain who you said wasn't a hero because he was captured?
Thank you Sen John McCain for standing up w/Trump on PTSD issue
@PCsReasy @SenJohnMcCain Mccaine should be ashamed for how he has allowed the VA to be run!
you sure would not know you draft dodger.
Donald Trump says vets with PTSD are weak and he praises McCain for setting Trump straight. @coloradonews3
