#BasketOfDeplorables
@UpstartDev You're going to make a fortune! The deplorables love this crap!
Id say that about you slasher/slash/slash/slash. You do nothing
Hammish, was that tweet (code for) "I'm a very lonely deplorable."
Youre a Les Miserabe
You're just a plain old miserable!
U claim to have veterans as family. They Trump supporters?
You are kidding right!
Thank you Mr Trump for being so insightful! We have been waiting for a childcare plan like this for so long
actually I listened to his plan he just gave and it helped low income mor
Ya gonna applaud the one Hillary has had for months now?
Then maybe read her website and platform, listen to her speeches, etc.
She's out there too, you're just not paying attention.
Exeptions to the rule are not the rule.
Yet @realDonaldTrump wants to cut funding for education, is that not part of child care? #DishonestDonald
I will have anybody's "6" You Say...
u little bitch
Adjustments need to be done to proposal. I make not enough money to benefit me.
Ahh...saving our country from tyranny?
LETS SEE THE TAX RETURNS
I think there is a lot of negative ads against Mr. Trump in Pa. She runs about one every hour. You have 0

fact: @HillaryClinton plan does twice of much for parents

You will help so many people with child care and someone should control what the day cares can charge.
Half the country are lazy moochers? @realDonaldTrump @CynthiaLummis
But hey, at least he still sees them as America. Hilary doesn't give that courtesy.
Of course there are no details and no real plan.  Just meaning less talk.
You mean the Child care program that Ivanka lied about?
Is the Trump company maternity leave policy as Ivanka claims? http://cnn.it/2d3jQqc  
a pence is worth nothing. We do not even have them anymore.

And Trump didn't pay his contractors or lawyers at all.  Which is worse?
shame on you Mitch
Hillary has fainted multiple times before this, confirmed by herself and Bill. More than pneumonia
Yeah, you wish!
He seems to be making a lot of sense. Wouldn't you say so?
Trump did not pay his contractors or lawyers, check out those law suits against him.  And the lawyers that won't represent him for reason
lie

let's ask god. 

@god did u use pareidolia to say Trump will B the next POTUS?
Hillary hates women, especially her husband's rape victims.

Trump is bringing them closer together!
maybe we'll find a basket for the two of them and send it straight to hell
U mean the 1 that is the same as others!

@Bruce_LeVell @CynthiaLummis 
Trump BRUCE LEVELL IS A CON ARTIST JUST AS UR, ANY "BLACK" MAN WHO SUPPORT UR DEPLORABLE! !
tax returns
too bad your daughter came up with it. Maybe she should run for president.
We already do this with state and fed funded school programs aka preschool...
Experts say NOT SO GOOD
Trump where did the 25000 come from you FRAUD
Another BS fake policy..., We know what type of policies you have in your company.
maybe because he has better poll numbers even though he wasn't born in America. That's sad.
I notice the nay Sayers don't use their name. Luv from AZ.
Doesn't help low income families, no paternity leave, and questionable funding.

HOW THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION'S FOREIGN BUSINESS TIES COULD UPEND US NATIONAL SECURITY
http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/23/donald-trump-foreign-business-deals-national-security-498081.html …
it is still a disgraceful plan for a country as rich as the US of A. Nothing but greed from the elites.
Utter bullshit. A tax deduction for high income earners =/= help for average families.

More benefits for the rich.
Since when is giving people free money a Republican idea?  I don't get it.
Mr. Trump, I don't think your proposal will work unless businesses can deduct the costs from taxes.
Trump Foundation in deeper trouble w/IRS than one illegal donation to FL official, much deeper.

http://www.dailynewsbin.com/news/five-charities-say-they-never-received-donations-that-donald-trump/26009/ …
Of course. More help for those who need it the least.
The child care plan is unfounded and will not work. Another empty promise...

I am praying you win. SS is NOT an entitlement. I since I was 16. I was required  to pay it in. I am 65.

Do you have dementia. Same response to 3 tweets. Trouble is we wouldn’t know the difference if you did!
You should thank Hillary for giving you the idea from her web-site. #shehaditcoveredalready
bit of smoke that sounds good to uninformed but provides little financial help for leave or child care cost

Oh, yes, let's vote DT and his family into the White House!!
