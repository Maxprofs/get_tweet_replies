unfortunately Jesse Jackson denounced you today. You're a fraud. Your #lawAndOrder stance is racist.
No, DOJ determined that. He discriminated against AA.
Times change, People change - <Dem to Rep>
HE hasn't changed is the point. The birther crap is racist. The crap he pulled in casino
Sorry, Birther 2008 well before Trump (HRC)
No, you're wrong. HE MADE IT A HUGE ISSUE AND WOULDN:T LET IT GO
He offered .3 million to end the questioning. Could have been good 4 Charity
Do you expect Americans to beleive the Birther In Chief isn't racist???????  #Birther
Who Hillary?Yes she's racist and she is the birther in chief
You're an idiot. Do you know how to do research?  or even think?  DOJ sanctioned TRUMP multiple time
nice language.
the corrupt DOJ is protecting #CrookedHillary If it was any 1 else they'd be in prison
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Youre so silly.
Funny how a supposedly racist white supremacist @realDonaldTrump was only white man supporting Jesse Jackson bid to presidency!
actions speak louder than politically motivated lawsuits
SO RACIST HIS CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON IS BLACK WOMAN. SO SEXIST, HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS A WOMAN.
U cant stand that blacks are not buying the propaganda that Trump is racist. LOL
meh -this video just shows Jesse Jackson was able to successfully shakedown Trump for "charity" donation
get this on Facebook
THAT'S MY PRESIDENT
but will you share his taxes so we can see the real Trump????
The democrat party don't encourage those in poverty to rise up they enable them and keep them down. Trump 2016
Racist because he said laziness is a black trait...
great job on showing this brother!!
Ahh how cute. Little Danny wants to get a participation metal for Donny for something almost 20 years ago.
beautiful, a true leader
@CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
Malcolm X called the 80% of blacks that vote Democrat "political chumps!"
And the TRUTH shall set you free. Seems you have helped the community for quite some time. Thank you.
@CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
that was back in 1999 & he was already helping minority's. Can the Clintons say that's?? #TrumpPence16 
@mcphersonfamily @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump All true I checked them myself
This is so perfect!I'll take an HONEST flawed man over a PIOUS odious man anyday/anytime
Absoltely!! I'm with you there!!
It's stupid to use this when Jesse Jackson literally criticized your candidacy this morning. #Fool
they should criticise you..why do u want to elect an anticonstitutionalist
wow. where did you learn that big word?  Of course you are ridiculously wrrong...but whatever....
Explain.
Trump is the anticonstitutionalist. Banning Muslims to start....
no ur party is anticonstitutionalist.actually went don't have to have immigrants
I agree. Sorry, I had to find out what party we were talking about, Ashley.
I don't know how to add extra words so I'm stuck cutting out a few words
@new_debis @realDonaldTrump @NAACP Hey, NAACP, what do you have to say about this?
i thought the right hated Jesse Jackson. Now I'm so confused

i had pictures w black people when i was younger, dated some. Still was a bit racist. Grew up
So cute, projecting your racism on others? Haha.
So cute, just being honest. Unlike right-wingers.
Not disagreeing with your honesty. I agree you are racist.
oh, really. how am i racist now? please show me.
You yourself said you were a racist as a child. Once a racist, always a racist.
Ahhh, for the good old days when you were a big contributor to Dems and a Clinton  sycophant.
Is supporting Jesse Jackson's shakedowns supposed to get me to want to vote for this guy?
I'll share a couple of items for you to look over.  

#voteTrump 
@PARISDENNARD The Central Park Five Ad Told Us Who Donald Trump Really Is #AMJoy http://on.mtv.com/2bKMXgS 
@Latinos4Trump16 White black Hispanic Americans know Trump is not a racist he just loves this country wake up America
trump apparently wasn't a racist when Hillary accepted his donation to her senate bid & attended his wedding!
Unfortunately Jesse Jackson has turned against Trump now.
@eddiern @realDonaldTrump We need this to go viral! Retweet to everyone you can.I am sending it to Fox.doubt they will use.
WOW !!  Run this video NON STOP, Mr. Trump !  CNN, MSNBC, and Clintons will hate you even more...GOOD !

These new.@HilaryClinton "deleted" emails were withheld from the FBI & the public They will show her true self
@RichardTBurnett this guy is horrible when someone helps you out be loyal what has Hillary done for you sad little man

SILENT MAJORITY IS BACK AND WILL GET OUR COUNTRY BACK! #standingwithwinner #americafirstfirst #trumptrain #maga 


Hey at least Trump isn't Hymie town right @RevJesseJackson
well anyone who does things that should be prosecuted is a racist too...
Nor do they mention he received the Ali award for minority support multiple times.   Chuckle
@CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton I thought #Hillary suggested he never was favoring the minorities. #HeAlwaysHas
he just won't let them live in his buildings
Another girly-man voting for HRC. Go figure. PC men have been so pussy-whipped.
umm girly man?? Maybe you should go back to the kitchen where you left your glasses. #dumpdrumpf
What? No scathing liberal attacks of this tweet? They'll selfishly ignore it, like they ignore TRUTH.
Trump rented him an office instead of discriminating against blacks like he used to. Give that man a Nobel.
@lalden73093 @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump
Stuff it Jesse you longtime jive ass B.S. artist . You and Hillery should get married already. Jesse you suck
@CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
because they lied about Duke endorsement- Need to get this out
Trump was never called a racist till he entered presidential race Thats how democrats work with slander & lies
John O'Donnell called him racist in 1991. Gave examples in his book.
anyone can lie or allege things. That doesn't equate the truth.
if you could explain this article from 1973, as well:
he who is without sin let him cast the 1st stone. We have the worst most UNAMERICAN president in our history. Voting
changing the subject now?
good night my man. It's late on the east coast
@sonianoemitweet @realDonaldTrump http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters-wayne-jackson.html?ref=politics&_r=0&referer= …
@mcphersonfamily @DanScavino @sonianoemitweet @realDonaldTrump They gave him a list of questions the people wanted to know SO?
Blacks don't  want to ask him ANYthing...he has shown us enough
yes he is LISTENING to blks & Hisp like me who r sick of Lyin Dems
YOU are in the minority! We've already factored you FEW out! #CK

Thank you! We already know this. DJT has helped so many now they try to paint him racist. #Scared #Hypocrites
nobody needs to try, he is. #RacistTrump
Trump wasn't found guilty. Here's #Hillary at the same time
But, things have changed since then, haven't they, Donald? Now you're a Republican and you want a Wall
What the hell is racist about a wall?  Do you want to dissolve this country and let the world in
Perhaps you are not familiar with Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition
so Jesse Jackson and that one guy at the rally make up the 1% who will vote for @realDonaldTrump. Impressive!
Do you get paid to be a troll, lol.
your profile looks like Russian bot. Proven fact that half of  @realDonaldTrump twitter followers fake. Likely U.
Yeah, I'm a bot eating my Russian caviar and vodka laughing at all your inconceivable rhetoric.
On @amjoyshow today Jesse Jackson stated that the @realDonaldTrump of 1999 is not the one of 2016. He now displays open bigotry
I have been offering this evidence and people still Blindly Deny, deny, deny. Sad really.
Wow where is @RevJJackson now when trump needs him. This is so disappointing. He rather help #CrookedHillary
how dare you expose the truth
Here's the truth:
Doooood, I think that pple got caught up wPastor who lies & spoke at your convention? http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3772198/Trump-backing-pastor-Mark-Burns-admits-falsifying-biography-claims-days-apologizing-tweeting-images-Hillary-Clinton-blackface.html …
1973 trump father ran business he took over a few years later. Get facts straight
that was 17 years ago. Lately you spout racist, bigoted, misogynistic and sexist remarks.JJ on MSNBC- No Trump!
MSNBC? Wow! Are you brainwashed.
Dems are just crooked, let's not forget,Jackson JR went to Prison 4 looting his campaign fund of $750,000 #Trump
even though I don't personally like J.J. it goes to show people how D.T. REALLY IS.  NOT LIKE MEDIA PORTRAITS.
Let's get the truth out.
.@CNN is 1 of.@HilaryClinton largest contributors So do U think they will tell U the Truth?

@Crystal_75FL @realDonaldTrump What, this isn't the first time Trump has spoken to "Black People"? Mainstream media lied again.
please dont think that showing up at a blk church in det. gives him any credibility
Well, ain't that some shit? What say you, Hillary?
Jackson found that there is a thriving business in the racism camp. Used his position for himself not the black people
Did you watch what he said this weekend??  LOL. Also, that was 17 yrs ago...#desperate #NeverTrump

@SassyPantsjj @realDonaldTrump Let's hope this video is seen by multitudes especially the black population. #MAGA
Why won't Jesse report on it?  Oh yes, he has to stay on the plantation built by the democrats.
This really needs to get out....
@GreggJarrett Why were you biased against Trump during your Sunday Morning interview #turnoff
You probably haven't noticed that J Jackson hasn't been relevant for at least 15yrs. A caricture of former self

Do U attack your friends enemy? Do U attack the man who will beat her? That's exactly what they did 2 Donald
.@amjoyshow set the record straight, he was on your show today.
Let me guess, Jesse won't be threatening to cut off Donald's balls like he did Obama, right?
As a hispanic New Yorker,this is the Donald Trump we've always known, Kind, Considerate, Caring,What USA needs!
3,700+ pages of HRC St Dept Schedules from AP FOIA leaked

Trump:ALL VETERANS bring their VETERANS IDcard 2 any doctor that acepts Medicare 2get the care they need IMMEDIATELY

@sweetatertot2 @realDonaldTrump So true.  God bless the USA!
as Jessie said this morning he hasn't decided to back either trump or hillary.
@Hillary Clinton Yea, a real racist U R.LOLOLOL
I am not AA, but Trump needs the Black vote.  He needs to reach out to the Black Churches and now.
Hillary drowned in plantation cess pool 
No one had a buoy
