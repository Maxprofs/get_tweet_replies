Do you have a point?  Republicans did everything they could to block it.  It's a disaster
go back and check your accusations

@victorbreaux @politico Adios amigos..

@luxorgroup @politico 116% in AZ! Obama offered insurance company MORE than they asked for because he knew it would implode
before Hillary could get Hillary care passed! #riggedelection
@EricTrump @politico
somethings with while come with a price
Obama acts and talks as though he is the President only for African Americans. Rest of the country does not matter to him
@sowtrout @politico and we do not care. What the criminal thinks.
loser
haha if only you how brain  robot don,t have brains or does democrats  wash away by be crooks buy vote & rigged the system
Obama legacy protection insurance is Hilary. More regulations, more taxes, more gridlock, more division and corruption

WRONG!
Wow! So, now it's 25%, what happened to the 59%+ you've been spouting? #LiarLiarPantsuitOnFire
- A vote for Hillary is an invitation to Islam to take America, and enslave it's people.
USA taxes should pay for medical care like other countries. Think one constructive idea.
show your taxes
85% have subsidies & the law is coming in under budget. But you never mention THAT, do ya Dishonest Don?
And to think this is how they raise their children to act.
You're a fraud.
How much would they have gone up without Obamacare?
lets down play the insurance companies CEO wages!! Love Obama!!
shows how private systems are a disaster
yeah but theyre there's more programs to aid in paying them
at the minimum!
@MeganSmiles @politico that means every hard working persons is going up too! POS
Obama lied to us... He is a weak person...
Got my increase today and ours jumps from $478 to $1004....more than doubled with less coverage!!!
taxes can pay for all of the medical payments. Medical care should be free like other countries
Let @GovGaryJohnson use his free market healthcare approach to lower healthcare costs! #votegaryjohnson2016
40% in NC! All but BCBS pulling out!
11 women have come forward accusing you of sexual assault. That number will keep  jumping.
you are right. DNC will keep paying these poor women to keep on coming ignoring the issues. dishonest
Spoken like a sheep Trumper.
where is the proof bitch? they had plenty of time to come out before...
you keep believing that.
Children use pictures. 
Adults use words. 
Try it.

because of thiefs like u
I just seen a insurance statement that tells the insured his rates will go up.  It's more that 2X.
probably more like 50%
Stop saying the election is rigged while you are the one rigging the election.
Remember the seniors only get a 0.03% increase in 2016, and ZERO in 2016..
@Sweetladywv  @Trump
#trump neglects to recognize that increased premiums are offset by increased federal subsidies. He has criticism, no plans
said last year & during 1 of the Republican debates this was going to happen. Trump knows DC & DC needs Trump #MAGA #TRUMP
A promise?Anything Congress passes re WTP,ie OCare they can not exempt themselves from. Its good f/WTP - shld be for them
OBAMA IS THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION TAKE ALL OUR $$$$
heres the truth.  all subsidized will not change.  employers plan, no change.  states who expand Medicaid no change.
When will people wake up to all of BO lies about this! Keep your own Dr etc!
Oh go get lost. You have no credibility to even discuss the ACA.
Hillary is gonna run to Qatar she put 1.8 billion in the bank last wkend over Q. No Bailey 4 her Mr President  45

the low side is 25% increase, the real average is about 65% increase.
117% in Arizona that's democrats for you. Make the poor even lower. What a mistake the people made don't do it again.#trump
Another failure of Obama
Most people get insurance through their work not through the govt.Due to the med law, I'm still paying less than 10 yrs ago
Try to Get A New Cost Effective Model to Replace Obamacare By 30/10 atleast a week before 8/11

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/arizona-obamacare-premiums …
bur youre part of the problem cuz you don't offer insurance to your employees!!
And @HillaryClinton wants to keep this nightmare system!

Why can't people deal directly with their doctors? Why an expensive middle man?
OVER 100% IN #Arizona
That's how much they were rising BEFORE Obamacare. Did you know that?
the democrats are crooks and taking money from middle class to put the insurance companies out of business.
@Trump_World @politico I just heard 116% increase in AZ. Will post my premium renewal rate when it comes. ACA is punitive.
WHY?
1st) if u r NOT an exchange customer u will NOT b effected AT ALL! 2nd) if u r, 1% or less will have to pay more, (con't)
@Trump_World @politico Some states more than that.

In some areas Obamacare will double in premiums in 2017.
Hillary's plan to end homelessness: force homeless people to buy houses.

Obama has been using some of that common core math on American public.
I was in a bad car accident.My spine is manufactured & live in pain. My husband died when I was 55. My premiums >$3000.HELP
either endorse a public option or healthcare as a human right or drop out you orange loud mouth.
@ArmorCavSpin @politico

Deductible will soar too
vote trump America 
You can't fix anything. Pay your taxes. #imwither #trumpisataxevader
.@realDonaldTrump @politico Meanwhile, on Planet Earth, the number of ppl affected here are far fewer than you claim.
.@realDonaldTrump @politico It's an important issue, and yet you make a terrible argument to support your case.

What we do in our spare time. She believes in you. Will see you tomorrow in CLT. Say hi to Ryland

there he goes again, obsessively tweeting
.@realDonaldTrump @politico MILLENIALs will not see salary increases to match healthcare increases, Hillary likes it & will raise taxes
You have lied so much in this campaign that nobody believes a word you say! Time for a holiday!
Most people I know are seeing much larger increases than that.
we will all be filing for bankruptcy if medical cost continue to rise.  Not fair for the working poor
next year ? Lmao try already
people wake up and vote for Trump!!!
@MDTwankyTwank  OBAMACARE, ES LIMOSNA CON ESCOPETA ,ALTÍSIMOS DEDUCIBLES SIN CONTAR MULTAS X NO TENER ASEGURANZA
Well AMERICA...it looks like they pulled an "OKIE DOKE" on you
@pmicc33 @politico in AZ there going up 116% vote for HILLARY . She is the ONLY HUMAN  that can fix it. YES, she's NOTTTY !

25% is an underestimate. If u r middle class , this is unsustainable
Couldn't even afford to buy ObamaCare, they do not have any insurance that is affordable, the whole system a JOKE



WE NEED THE SINGLE PAYER PLAN HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSED YEARS AGO
Just Voted!  My healthcare costs are 1807.00 monthly and 20K deductible for my wife and I.  Now more that my mortgage.
This is how premiums go up! @realDonaldTrump Took $17 Million in #Insurance for Damage Few Remember http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-17-million-insurance-damage-remember-43021307 …
its really more like 80% hikeup
president Hillary Clinton will fix so shut your big mouth!
and #maryfallin is an idiot I'm glad you didn't pick her
they went up 35% in Oklahoma last year and are reported to double next year.  We will only have BCBS in state 
Just in case any of you had extra money laying around that you weren't quite sure how to spend.
Hillary will fix it,right after she gets inaugurated,REBATES AND ALL!
Trump keeps spreading his lies
TRUMP brand now worthless. FOOL.
Yeah, but how come you don't talk about this, iinstead of defending stupid remarks?  Obamacare passed without 1 Repub. vote
however most people will get subsidies to lower their premiums
if you want to keep your job get tax breaks and want good health care vote trump
that's a minimum .Republican held states will double,already happening !! Vote Trump

#wake up America vote Trump for change!

Epic fail!
http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/19/the-drug-trafficker-donald-trump-risked-his-casino-empire-to-protect.html … what prices did this guy charge?
Mr. Trump, this points up one of the needed tweaks, curtailing corporate profits so they are reasonable but not exorbitant.
Tennessee is 62%! I have MS & several chronic illnesses, I don't know what I'll do.
Will you able to afford them Donald? Let me send you some money
ya too bad without Obama care regular premiums would have been hire do you research!!!!@
mine went up 30% and forced me to choose a worse option in health care. Absolutely disgusting.
I still say this was panned by @POTUS , @realDonaldTrump
@FlaDems @NHDems @JewishDems @JTAnews
More Lies From Losing Donnie
Nov 1st coming2 soon 4r #CrookedHillary. Premiums to rise high so Hilly says vote now so you do not see truth. #AlwaysTrump
Epipen jumped 200% picture that
+Deductible $1500, 150 per visit, +$250 per night for Bed. YOU CANT EVEN DIE IN A BED W/ OBAMACARE! OBAMA GRABBED ALL OF US
And what exactly is your replacement plan
We need Universal Health Care/Single Payer.
Obama tried to give us that, but the GOP blocked him.
Which is LOWER  than the rise rate Pre-Obamacare. Fact. Am I right Mr Trump? Am I right?  dim wit! 
Republicans already wasted millions of Taxpayer's dollars Repealing ACA.
Always said Obamacare strictly about controlling costs, rationing & never about delivering quality healthcare.
WOW!  My UNION premiums went down!! GO UNION!!! REPUBLICANS DID THIS BY FIGHTING SINGLE PAYER Plan to begin with!
