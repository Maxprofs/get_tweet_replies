What a great guy..  Get ads asap, hit the tv lines big time. maybe use Obamas 2008, Can you do that legally?
@PeterThiel @realDonaldTrump, how do I make sure to boycott companies  that boycott companies chaired by people w/ opposing political views?
did you ask him what he thinks about this?
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
and wen ppl died in Benghazi, Hill said what difference does it make. She is resp. 4 murder inc. Dr. death.
Because he knows DT is NOT Racist, or anything else. Wants progress for all.
...and right into Trump's pocket. BFD.
Good people supported Hitler, too. #ImWithHer #trumpisacrook
Well, there are probably better ways to piss $1.25m away, but not many...
@peterthiel Thiels an angry old self loathng German closet queen supports new Hitler like his ancestors
What a waste of money?
tomorrow  wil be your day to present ur manifesto do it well just lyk ur wyf did in fox proud
thought you were funding your own campaign! Liar! #NeverTrump

I greatly admire Peter Thiel.
her 30 years failure,scandals is a point.Be presidential yet very aggressive on safe,prosperous and Tax cuts job creation.
Keep hitting hard on election is rigged giving example of Virginia and Pennsylvania voter registration without eligibility
great great winning speech in Colorado Springs.Keep similar blessed speech for 21 days to destroy Hillary
Great. Just ~$74M short of Clinton for this month now?
And many people are closing their PayPal accounts!
@crusader1683 @RosieGray @nytimes Thank you Peter
Peter Thiel isnt afraid to fight for the best choice and that is Donald J. Trump.
so scary that supporters of HRC find her lies & cover up of Benghazi better. No character from fools.
what a great feeling to have that kind of money to be able to support someone that you believe in !thank you for support!
what a waste of money. #NotaSingleState for your #Trumpness
THANK GOD 4 @peterthiel !

@realDonaldTrump 2016-2025
@ChikaMaduO @RosieGray free biafra
Better late than never..Every bit helps.
he wouldn't cut loose with that kind of money if Trump wasn't doing great #VotingTrump 
He would have put that money to better use by burning it to keep people warm this winter.
the only one with guts & good judgement
Why? Did Trump give u the $ to do this on top of a hefty check for yourself?
tell us more about him, I want to support his product whatever it is.  #Trump2016
.                 He must need a right off really bad or he really thinks TRAITOR TRUMP has a chance
@PunchyMcgregor 
Thank U Mr Thiel
You're posting about only having ONE prominent supporter? I guess you have to highlight your one & only. #SAD
..if i had , id give it too.
Hillary calls black servant the "N" word on regular bases.
what his legal defense rape charge is quite expensive you think
wow better off giving it to his victim s
Unlike Cuban, how much does it take to know that Hillary is morally bankrupt? Kudos to Peter here.
congratulations!
congrats!
your wasting your money cause Donald isn't running for President.. He's just tryin to revive his Brand
Spend some of that money on TV ads in Illinois where you have a snowball's chance in hell. Please.
.@realDonaldTrump @RosieGray did @realDonaldTrump blow him for this $$? #realquestion.
Isn't this the way YOU say it works for Clinton?
Well Good!
You just threw all that money away which could have fed millions
You just threw all that money away which could have fed millions!!

Good. But he might as well pour gasoline on it and light a nice bonfire. It won't help.
Good see you just have to have more Faith in Your Supporters ok. 
Another fool parted with his money.
@Trumpertarian @RosieGray @nytimes We shudder and cringe to think of Americas future in tghe hands of Hillary.Folks regret
@Trumpertarian @RosieGray @nytimes Thank you Mr Thiel. The Media has been so unfair toTrump.A convictmay be in tghe WH

He's a man who backs up his words with serious money. #Campaign2016 #TrumpPence16 #womeninbusiness #millennials
Sounds like pay to play. What have you promised him?

Wasted money on a megalomaniac.   Drowning in conspiracies.   No basis in facts.  Sad old man.
Good for you Peter thank you:)
#America .vs. #trump

#Debate

Who is getting #stiffed with the bill this time, huh #donaldtrump?

@realdonaldtrump
Trump folks still haven't said if @realDonaldTrump or Trump Fdn paid for the $29K in food/supplies given to Second Harvest Food Bank in NC.
you're fired Don.
Trump going after accusers is ok but he accuses Hillary of the same and she is a bad person?Trump UNFIT
already canceled my account!! Now delete yours... 
Who does Donald turn to for his news?  The New York Times.  

@realDonaldTrump @RosieGray @nytimes
Now you're tweeting @nytimes articles? I thought they were awful or something?
another perv like DT
If the Rep Party is not supporting Trump they won't get another dime from me!
Have I understood correctly that the Rep Party is not paying for Trump's campaign ads?  Surely, this is untrue.
what a waste of money, better to give it to charity 
What a waste. A donation of that money by @peterthiel to my charity's initiatives, could have save lives.
I thought Dondi was proudly self-funded. He "DID NOT NEED" outside funding.
That's money down a black hole
PIG 1 A ND PIG 2, PIGS ALL!
Thanks for that..Donald needs as much as he can get. .

Dropping PayPal @peterthiel You will regret this choice
@BinsackSb @RosieGray @nytimes Thank you @PeterThiele #MAGA 
@USNEEDSLEADERS @RosieGray @nytimes
#HillaryDoesntStandForAmerica #CrookedHillary #MAGA #TrumpTrain #ShesDying #DrugTestHer #ProjectVeritas #PodestaEmails #HillarysHealth 

and you are giving it back because you are self-financing, right? #nationaldisgrace
More proof that being rich doesn't make you smart. #SAD
thought you were self funding and not taking large donations! Now you're on the hook
Thank you @PeterThiele
who?
He is a gay guy
you have my vote but I would like to hear more talk about how you will make it better for low income families to survive
/AWESOME!
Thank you but we could have used your support way before now.
That only shows how despicable and sleazy Thiel is... it raises you not one inch!
why would he want to be a part of this?:
He's a sick corrupt man
He is a great guy , a great supporter, a great humanitarian working for a noble cause of peace and  progress.
we are revoking thiels gay card
Are you actually working for Hillary, because you're the strongest advocate she has.Thanks to you she will win #you'reunfit
Wait, I thought you were self funding! LOLOL  So Theil is the 1 big $ donor you have left?

why? Does Donald know something about him?
money down the drain!
that is great news
Something is missing (Mustache)
Yes! Love this guy.  He is one smart dude, and WHO does not love Paypal!!  Thank you Peter Thiel, YOU r a winner
Be ever grateful
Thank you!! #TrumpPence16

Go Trump ! Why doesn't Hillary wear an American pin on her lapel ????
Generally recognized as a ruthless douche bag. GREAT endorsement to go along with your others!

@USAneedsTRUMP @RosieGray @nytimes That's great.Trump needs about 40$mil to flood tv w ads&couple 1 hour live TV tlk issues
Good. let him waste money that could have gone to a vets charity.
The reason for short list of rich supporters is Trump not promising corp welfare for them like Crooked Hillary!!
So now you quote NY Times after insulting them and threatening to sue them? Your hypocrisy knows no bounds.
He needs a Tax Deduction,... that's all 

Vote McMullin  http://tinyurl.com/jzplq4a 
I thought the NYTimes is poor journalism... we shouldn't trust what we read for example..
@thompsoncheri22 @RosieGray @nytimes right on dude
WONDERFUL PATRIOT &GOP LOYALTY..NOV LANDSLIDE PRES TRUMP
congrats on big donation now can you fix roads plz and deport gays when elected? #MAGA #fudgePAC
What a waste. He should send it to me, he'd get as much out of it.
Thank you Mr. Thiel.
Just closed my PayPal account...Simple is better anyway.
Throwing his money out the window!
Bless his heart!
