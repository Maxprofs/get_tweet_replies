YES I do!
@realDonaldTrump Donald knows how to get in and get the job done and get the US economy going.  A strong economy positions for you to do a lot of good things in the future.
Mr. President please listen to both sides + give us lower premiums better coverage and every American covered.
I would have to cover my mouth ANYTIME I was with Trump, as any outrages thing would make me laugh. And to laugh would be only appropriate.
Bird brain, you are wrecking the insurance
- Once again, taking full credit for what others have done to boost your own personal agenda. Disgraceful!
Last breath for the fossil fuel industry.

Dear President Trump. A good tax cut for regular working  people would be to go back to the 1980s on Tips ...REMOVE TAX ON WAITRESSES' tips
T-bag. You make me sick.  Your abhorrent ethic creates a gag reflex every time I see your name.  Attacking children now?

You can boast about this, but it would've been better if you'd created green energy jobs, not environment destroyers.
Hey, all good. Stop pointing the finger at immigrants, transgenders and the media. Bring people together for the good.
Wow, a whole 0.06%! You go girl! Buuut, what happens when you fail to follow through and it crashes? What will you do then?
FAKE NEWS
keep pushing your agenda! Make America Great Again! Jobs are the key to everyone's success!

Thanks Obama! @BarackObama

Politicians like to make short term gains for great long term sacrifices @Kasparov63
We can read the headline. No cause & effect here, just coincidence.
NIGGA 
do NOT take credit for this bubble man 
we're all just a few months from tasting the dirt 
thank you so much for making jobs more and more available for American people! I am grateful.
Cool story, but how do you sleep knowing hard-working people are being removed from their homes & families to be deported?
Are you aware of the inhumanity your administration is guilty of? Does this make you proud?
are you aware it is illegal to cross the border without permission? America first! @realDonaldTrump @BBCNews
.@realDonaldTrump Remember when you promised to protect the #LGBT community?
more lies #HeartlessGOP
yeah from your mouth!
keep it up 
I can't wait to see how big this crash is going to be in the next eight months or so
Not sure! Trump Impeachment will make market jump. It likes stability. No unpredictable loon in the WH! @Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump
My Pres Obama  by far one of the worst Pres in U.S history. Lost more Dem seats with his radical ideology.
was so hopeful with the lull in your tweeting , like maybe you had finally realized you needed to stop that crap... but no
It's fake news Donald. Don't believe it.
way to go Mr. President keep up the good work.

Thanks, Obama.
He did good.
looks like Ford did the best. SNL mocked him his entire term.
Apostrophes aren't quotation marks, Don.
You really must think the two likes of the quotation mark are costing you characters or something. 
Trump angry, Trump smash. Trump good president. Trump love speaking in third person.
lost the popular vote in the US election by 3 million votes--more than any other US president in history.
Two words: Electoral College. You lost. Deal with it. #TRUMP
sure, but you need to deal with the fact that the majority of Americans will resist
No, they won't. They want the border secure & illegals out. The President will do that.
remind me why we're spending billions of dollars on something that's not really an issue?
I'm pretty sure he can't be impeached for interfering with people's weed habits.
I'm pretty sure people don't get how hard it is to impeach a president.
the impeachment is easy. Conviction not so much.
I wouldn't call it easy but yes bottom line is it'll be nearly impossible to get him out. Especially with R controlled congress.
Bill was impeached for lying about something that, while maybe immoral, wasn't illegal. How is it not easy?
the house votes to impeach. I think w/a Rep. controlled house it will be harder to get that majority vote w/a Rep. President.
I think it'll be easier than expected. There are plenty of republicans who've already jumped off his bandwagon, w/ more to come.

‘I Over-exaggerated That Story’ Liar, liar, liar.

fake news
One more promise fulfilled.  Thank you President Trump.  More action than talk.
Talk about fake information!
there are always people who seek to make gains from the hard work of others. You are riding on OBAMAS coat tails.
thanks. I am very happy to cash in on your fake bubble. Just let us know when you will get impeached so we can sell.
up 14% awesome...Donald Trump is going to rebuild the nation the way it should be.
Time will tell, not the S &P 500. Oh, and by the way,  A PLEDGE IS NOT A JOB!  
Self aggrandizing much?
Companies are coming back to USA to put robots to work.
tweets such as this immediately tell me you know nothing.
nothing to take credit for. You haven't put policies into place allowing you to take credit for this. Riding Obama policies
Except for travel industry related jobs that will be affected by YOUR ill-plannedtravel ban. $$mil lost/businesses close.

jobs will be created in the middle class not by the top percent or corps. U dont knw first thing about jobs. #impeach
You renew jobs pledge, but every step you take takes us farther away from jobs. Do you understand how the economy works?
Keep pressing ahead. You know you are on the right path. The "hate" will rescind to a "whimper" soon (we can only hope) !!!

A pledge carries no worth.
That had NOTHING to do with you
Corporations get richer.... working man gets poorer. DOW will tank in the end!
