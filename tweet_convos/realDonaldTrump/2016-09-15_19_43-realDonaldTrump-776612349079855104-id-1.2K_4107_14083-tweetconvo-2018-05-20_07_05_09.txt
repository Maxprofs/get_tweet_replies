your  bullshit statement on birtherism is the most disgusting thing I've read this month. Delete your campaign.
omg, bringing up old shit is all you have to work with? Find something new lefty!
that statement is brand new and full of lies.
of course it does, but what is a liberals definition of that? Am I one because I believe in immigration laws
I am not calling you one. I am asking you how you can support a candidate who is supported by Nazis.
same way you can support a candidate that is supported by cop killers, white beaters and rioters, I guess
Disturbances that arise from the beliefs that white supremacists hold.
what disturbances have been done? Only ones I've seen are rioters.... Liberal protesters at Trump rallies

Hillary talks about Putin a lot more than Trump does. She signed off and allowed them to buy 20% of OUR Uranium, who does that?
You don't know the facts. Why don't you look them up and try again?
Uranium One, You don't know the facts.  She was on CFIUS and approved the deal.
State was one of 9 govt agencies, plus independent fed & state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.
What part of she was SOS at the time don't you get, CF also got Huge $ at the time
Not at the same time, more than 2 years earlier, which was all used for aids and medical relief.

There is a special place in hell for you.
@washingtonpost many people died under her?seriously?crazy fanatic, don't you have a riot to be at?
a whole lot LESS died under Hillary than under Bush, Bush,  Reagan.  Please,  stop.
because of war? War happens every 20 years, America wants to be most powerful, fact
you make ZERO SENSE.
we lost 250 Soldiers under Reagan, Obama doubled Bush's death count, do research
Hillary campaign stole from her own donors #HillsFargoFraud

ALCOHOL AND ALCAHOL IS DA SAME, SMART ASS. DONT TRY ME I AM SPEAKING WAY MORE LANGUAGES THAN U CRIPPLE
Why do you refuse to admit that President Obama is a u.s. citizenship

Mr. Trump, we're behind you 100% and agree with your policies ~ but puhleeze get a haircut.
Birther breath reeks
So does yours after working the streets and giving 20 BJs
Nevermind Hammish, Sophia's got ya covered!

was Obama born in America? yes or no will suffice
It won't suffice for me. It's a good start, though. He doesn't get to just tweet it. Must be video+audio.
you are deblorable
Donald, why are many people saying you have rabies? #TrumphasRabies
I could believe it.  He crawled from under the New York gutters.  This might say why!

Because the trump administration would prosecute her

Obama the worst POTUS EVER!! Even worse than Carter.
All this recovery after Bush had us on the brink of depression sucks. How dare Obama save the USA
the whole world is laughing at Obama trying to be a leader. @realDonaldTrump @AK_TWEET
Actually, the whole world is genuinely laughing at a serial liar & loser #Trump

We'll finally have a genuine,lovable,patriotic,non-politician,#AmericaFirst LEADER in our White House.Can't wait.
was @BarackObama born in the US?
Good sport. And as expected CNN spins it into a criticism  of Trump.  They are sad.
this was great fun and perfect timing for a little lighter fare!  Loved it!
Rearrange your four strains of hair, but you're still a racist down yo the follicles!
Thanks for being such a good sport Mr Trump, we got a kick out of that! #TrumpPence16 #NativeAmericansforTrump

דנלד טראמפ מנצח!! (דוד נתנאלי - ישראל)

your hair is an embarrassment. Let it go. You're balding. Deal with it. Ridiculous.
Get rid of the swoop Donny! Your denial of your baldness is like your denial  in your ability to be #POTUS2016
I missed it :(
“A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality." WillyS
Funny, that's what they used to say about you at work.
oh! Aren't you the witty one!
That's what your gay lover said in the morning when you remembered her name!
We love the hair. No matter what the hair stays!
You would rather have your hair messed up than release your taxes? Does not make sense.
I like jimmy Fallon but all that does is normalize racism and make them seem like a "cool" guy or "normal"
Future President, so Cool w foolishFallon, #TRUMP's a Good Sport & We LVE YOU FOR THAT! @MAGA#FLORIDA4TRUMP
OUR NEXT POTUS! THE DONALD!!
Trump is just your typical blue collared American who worked his ass off 2 get his fortune today! #AmericanDream
