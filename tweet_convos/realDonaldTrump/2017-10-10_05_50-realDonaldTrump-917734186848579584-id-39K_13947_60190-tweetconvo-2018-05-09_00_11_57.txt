Poll: Trump approval falls in every state
Retiring GOP lawmaker defends Corker: More Republicans should speak out against Trump
Corker reveals open secret: Trump requires adult supervision
IKR...that's what he's dealing with? That's what WE'VE been dealing with. Seriously anyone claiming the GOP is still my party...please stop.
Personally though I'm more of the opinion he's trying to distract us & avoid enforcing Russian sanctions. They are now 10 days overdue. #WTF
See, if you remember in May, Sen Corker was the one who first strangely refused to write the Russian Sanctions bill.
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/01/corker-russia-sanctions-senate-237855 …
Then he was the final hold out to signing it
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/world/europe/russia-sanctions-senate-north-korea.html …

& meets w/ Trump 2 weeks before they're due?
https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2017-09-15/tennessee-sen-corker-meets-with-trump-following-spat …
So it just seems way to convenient to me that days after sanctions are due a GOP senator uses the words WWIII for the first time. #Diversion
The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!
What you’re dealing with is someone who doesn’t mind letting the world know what an infantile simpleton you are and how dangerous you are!
@realDonaldTrump is a narcissistic, racist, simple-minded, maniac and @VP is playing along in his race baiting games. #TakeAKnee
People dying in #CaliforniaWildfires, #PuertoRico has no power, Nazis in the streets, and you’re tweeting insults to @jemelehill! Grow up!

Hey Kim!  How’s the pay as a Russian troll bot?
I love how anyone who disagrees is a bot now. It's like trying to find replicants based on how different they look from you.
Except for the actual bots, of course.

Either leave or get behind our POTUS!!! Same for McConnell!! Both are anti-Trump & stalling his agenda. WE SEE WHAT UR DOING! 
Absolutely CORRECT!!! They need to GO!!
Actually, it sounds like you are dealing with attacking American citizens, slandering your own party, & still going on about the NFL.
I honestly don't know if you spell simple words wrong on purpose to be inflammatory, but it makes our country look weak & ignorant when you do that #Liddle
Can you imagine being 71 years old with every available resource at your tiny fingertips, & you choose not to be a better person? What a wasted life.
Don't worry, @realDonaldTrump, we recorded the @nytimes...
WHERE IS THE LINK!!!!!
Watch OANN tonight! James has a special.
Watch OANN they want to brainwash you to be Anti American
You're thinking of @CNN.

Damn, you guys are good !
Little Bob Corker thought he could outmaneuver Trump, but he came up short. Ridicule is an Alinsky tactic that Trump has honed to a science
It's the winning formula Trump used in the primaries, helping to make quick work of 16 GOP losers. Little Marco. Lying Ted. Low energy Bush
During the general, it was 'crooked Hillary'. Once Trump brands you, it sticks. Like glue.
It's also the method Trump uses to hold up a mirror at his morally shriveled enemies. They obviously don't like what they see.
But it's just their own reflection.More generally,Trump's 'little Bob' tweet holds up a mirror on the DC swamp, showing what he's up against
It worked. McConnell promptly crawled out of his shell to defend Little Bob. The establishment vs outsider Donald J. Trump. Message sent.
Trump, like the late Steve Jobs, is the ultimate disruptor.
He has no respect for the calcified politics of the DC swamp that led to winless wars, endless debt and national decline.

Thank you Mr. President.

Keep up the great work.

Um... There's literally a recording of you boasting about sexually assaulting women.
There is, in fact, multiple recordings of you boasting about sexually assaulting women.

Because you're a fucking monster.
16 known allegations of sexual assault. Recorded videos of him bragging about sexual assault. Yet not only no arrests, he’s our president 
Absolutely..positively insane.
You are the one who sounds like a fool. What an embarrassment to the world.
11 people have died, hundreds are missing, and many homes destroyed in NAPA, and not a damn tweet about that. You are THOUGHTLESS, SELFISH 
He IS consistent in his thoughtlessness! My heart bleeds for you Napa! I’m so sorry!

Florida

He's doing a shit job and blaming everyone else.
Don’t forget ignoring Mexico,  who helped with Katrina AND Harvey! The 2 things he can be counted on for are APATHY and NEGLECT!
Mexico is helping Puerto Rico too.


Becky! You're late for your shift!
Where's your babysitter, Donny John?


Translation: The @nytimes, who gave me great coverage during the election, allowed Bob Corker to say what every non-insane Republican wants
to say and it makes me look like I'm crazy and dangerous, so I'll flip it around and call him a fool. See how smart I am.
It took you this long to notice
that's what bothers me with all these folks -
What on God's Earth were they expecting? Dignity? elevation of character?
I wld be careful about calling on an IQ test. I would bet MY OWN LIFE that U wld score low. Very low. PLEASE TAKE ONE. LOL TOTAL DOTARD!
It would then be a FAKE TEST...
He is confusing IQ with GQ. He reads magazines & thinks they are books. As I said, Tillerson is boning up on Dick & Jane. Lunch w/POTUS*

I believe the correct the term is "micro penis"



How's Melania's cyberbullying campaign going?
Corker granted the interview for the express purpose of warning the country that you are unstable and crazy. That's the real news Donny.
Corker may be "little" to you but you'll always be #DOUCHEYDonald and #TINYHandsDonnie! 
Haha... love this pic!
Small hands(), even smaller brains, if he even have any! 
Does your sitter have the day off again?
He's the fool here, isn't he? He needs many more sitters so there won't be any days off.
You can't even spell "little" correctly and yet you claim you have such a high I.Q.
1st, BIG BOB knew it was an on-the-record interview. 2nd, Tillerson will be thinking this EVERY TIME he looks at you today at lunch. ENJOY!
He doesn't have to say a thing. The look says it all.
So true.

We’re dealing with explaining to our children what real leadership once looked like (hint: @BarackObama). This is not leadership.
Children should not be allowed to watch TV at all until after the impeachment.
Dear Mr. President, with all due respect, @SenBobCorker issued this statement via Twitter. The New York Times was not tweeting for him.
 And I provide this helpful commentary to the WH on a pro bono basis. That's patriotic.
This is what the world is dealing with!!
Just in case you forgot, this is how we al feel
How many days now do u rant nonsensically with petty topics while US soldiers families are grieving and u won't even mention them. 
#Niger
#Trump hasn't mentioned the soldiers who died bc he's practicing how to say #Niger He's not used to saying that word w/o the additional "G".

Well...am I wrong? 
Nope!!
OMG....is he really that tiny? 
TWO THINGS: First, @SenBobCorker REQUESTED that the @nytimes record the interview. He also recorded it. Second... 
#Resist #ImpeachTheMoron
You are a fool and a failure, and that's what we're dealing with! #MoronTrump
The only fool here is you, you old orange Nazi bitch.

4 Green Berets were also killed in Niger last week & he can't be bothered as the death toll rises by the hour in PR.

The Queen doesn't want to meet w/ our moronic Prez.

And unfortunately, we're dealing with you as President.
It's good we have a President that won't go on an apology tour. America first!
Because apologizing is so bad.
We don't have to apologize for being the best country in the world. Just my opinion bud.
You know what’s failing ? Your presidency . 
Liddle' Bob Corker is a bigger man than you will ever be.
I'm more concerned about @realDonaldTrump's liddle hands. So creepy, and emasculating Why are his hands so tiny? #liddlehands #tinyhands
You forgot the apostrophe after Liddle'. I don't know why it's there, but our dear leader apparently thinks it's necessary.
It is very strange. It's not really where an apostrophe should go. Maybe he just wants to extend things like his #tinyhands
just heard the recording and so glad he recorded it. Liar you are proved again.
Yeah must be hard to deal with the fool You see in Your mirror every day
I literally heard the recording of Bob Corker saying he recorded it and making sure the reporter also had it recorded. 

You're lying again.

You make yourself sound like a fool daily, so at least you're perfecting something while in office... Are you ever going to pass a significant piece of legislation that actually strengthens America?
.pssst. Trump. Failing NYT caught you in another lie...
No, Donald.  There’s a bigger fool in the Oval Office. #impeach
#FuckyouTRUMP
You don't know how to spell "little," & you're challenging others to a battle of wits? I need some covfefe to deal w/this idiocracy.
you're a fücking moron donald
.@realdonaldtrump you know what's Liddle'? your hands 
#25thAmendment Again it what you're dealing with but not what you should be dealing with
Seriously, who spells "little", or even "'lil" as "Liddle"? My illiterate cat spells better than Donnie.
"Liddle"?  Where's that IQ test? #WorstPresidentEver
Goes along with his tiny brain.
Our country is in serious jeopardy!  Bob Corker is doing a great service to it.  Where are the rest of the republicans?

Sad!!!
Was he made to sound a fool? That suggests he was forced into it. Of course, you sound like fool as your default condition.
You embarrass yourself and the country daily. "Liddle" is not a word, it's "little". Please take a IQ test. See if you can score over 100.
This is TRUTH 
Are you implying this type of "Liddle'?" People with IQs over 87 want to know . . .
You have been saying the failing NYT forever, it doesn't look like it's failing! 
15 ppl are dead in NorCal, 200 missing because of a massive blaze burning through residential neighborhoods, and these are your priorities?

We love this president! Stock market highest ever! Unemployment, lowest! Confidence, higher than anytime in the last eight years!
.@SenBobCorker KNEW he was "on the record". As usual you either; didn't read the article or are lying. My guess, the latter! #TrumpLies
You might want to stop reading fake news yourself. Corker admitted to asking for the conversation to be recorded. Liar!
you said "senate committee found no collusion with the Russians"
 = fake news LIE by you, they said no such thing.
#Impeach & #Imprison
What you said please stop spreading your lies and lead this country or get out-of-the-way
They need to be shut down immediately they are propaganda
You ain't fit to wipe @SenBobCorker ass #fuckingmoron &that comes from a dieheart democrat he is educated smart &won on merit. #putinbitch
Speaking of failing...your presidency is FAILING miserably
Corker will act like McCain and attempt to stop tax reform. Come on Tennessee and put the pressure on this rogue establishment senator!#MAGA
Look forward to seeing your head explode when Trump gets another Supreme Court pick.  Your liberal ideology will be squashed for decades!
@realDonaldTrump your daily reminder, Tick-Tock Traitor Almost #MuellerTime Every day is one day closer to your impeachment!
Oh yeah then there's this,,,,

Just for that, time for your nap and no  for you Donnie.
You sound like one every time you tweet. That's what WE have to deal with.
We have a president that is setting our country back many many years  . that's what we're dealing with #MoronPOTUS
another lie. he ASKED them to record it.
Who needs facts when you can tweet whatever the fuck you want?  More fake news from the ass-hat-in-chief...

You aren't "dealing with" anything. You're embarrassing yourself. As usual.
Ahahahahah as if anyone needs to try to make you sound like a fool. You do a spectacular job on your own.
.@realDonaldTrump you still don't know how to fucking spell. 'Liddle' is a child's spelling! You even overrode autocorrect to tweet it! SAD!
So childish
Keep fighting the swamp for us Mr. President.
This is what you always do ...belittle people (liddle')  Bob Corker. Sad#IMPEACH
Why do you have to be so vengeful and vindictive? So weak. Sad. Pathetic. Unfit for that office.
You do totally fine on your own. Believe me! Bigly fine.
Liddle?
Oh. Nice words BTW.  YOU HAVE BIG BEAUTIFUL INCREDIBLE WORDS!
The spelling is wrong should be little. Watch that I Q

Now you know how we feel dealing with you.
Senator Corker IS a fool & G d is laughing.
NY Times doing great liar. Sen. Corker is an honorable man realized you not fit for US Prez had the guts to say what Congress think of you.
Go ahead, Mr. Trump, keep attacking the GOP Congress.  A Dem Congress will move for impeachment.

The Failing @nytimes set #TrumpsLittleLimpRocket up by exposing me for the impotent tool I am

What exactly does Liddle' mean? Is it a schoolyard taunt from  childhood? Why the apostrophe?I'm puzzled and dismayed by your #bullying  .
The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am!
Whenever you use "failing @nytimes " I know that means you're jealous their ratings are better than yours!
