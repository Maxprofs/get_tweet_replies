Thanks President Trump!! Even though many misguided people give Obama the credit, the intelligent people know what’s going on. God bless you
.PERIOD
And BoBahma had nothing to do with it
Was this in that folder you require that gives you only positive news about yourself? You know that is a problem, right?
Well done Obama.

Pity The Trump effect is starting to kick in now though...
Faux News literally parroting the things Trump says the media isn't covering. 

PS. Thank you @BarackObama for the stability and stocks you've driven! You did a great job!!
Nope this is all Trump. Obama couldn't even get one year of 3% GDP growth. He was the only president in history that couldn't do that.
 Right. Exactly what had changed to encourage that growth?
Sad. America is waking up. #IMPEACHTRUMP
Keep claiming the accomplishments of others as your own. Public disgust will continue to rise and your numbers will continue to sink.
You're misinformed.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/ …  The AP has him down to 32%.
They love regulation free capitalism, until the shit crashes, and it will.
Only because dumb republicans think they are getting a big tax break.
#FakePresident @realDonaldTrump fiscal year begins with a bang...33,000 jobs LOST. Can't ride President Obama coattails no more
Thank you mr. President
So then the next recession hits will @realDonaldTrump take ownership for that too?
Go trump. Obama is a idiot
Quote Me: 2 Sure fire ways to tell Trump is lying; 1) His lips are moving 2) His fingertips are moving... Trump is a liar!!! LOCK HIM UP!!
Well yeah. Rich assholes are happier than Nazi pigs in shit. How about the other 99%?
Just imagine how lucrative gassing an entire race of people would be!
Ppl act like stock market is raining $$$ on us. I would genuinely like to know if average Trump voter has more cash in pocket b/c of it.
When Obama was in office they raved every time the stock market went up and said it was 100% Obama. But with Trump, it's a moot point?
Its the rate of increase. Heights make them dizzy. Can't think straight.

This is the #TrumpEffect, the business of America does better when you put a businessman in office. He's the man for the job #MAGA
How has that helped our pockets?

Nixon: “I’m not a crook.”
Trump: “I’m not a moron.”         h/t DW

Pass #TaxReform to keep stock market rally going
any #politician who is against tax reform wants to see us fail as a country
Thanks again Obama!
And this has some to do with what 1% of Americans?


You suck.
Thanks @BarackObama
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY 
The Nation is getting stronger!!! #MAGA 
We will make America Great
Never Never Never
Thanks to Obama
You know your sad dad had nothing to do with this, right?

Thanks to your $100,000,000,00 book.  Think big and even become President elected by the people. Great man.
To bad you’ll never see this in the main stream media!! Such BS!!

300K jobs lost.  I'm sure the first of many months in the slow slide into a GOP created Recession.
Still Obama's economy.
Our foolish leader hinted plans to our enemies! Folks, when will our leaders learn that surprise is best tactic! What a moron!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse
Thanks Putin #TrumpRussia #TrumpDossier
@realDonaldTrump say this: Thank you, Obama!
How unlike you to overlook reporting on the 33k jobs that were LOST in Sept! ..wait, no it isn't. It's completely in character.

#FakePOTUS
@realDonaldTrump 

REPUBLICANS LOVE AMERICA & FREEDOM 

DEMOCRATS LOVE BEING IN CONTROL AND HATE PEOPLE THAT CHALLENGE

Interesting, that is when I noticed that people became more and more radicalized an stupid. Americans were smarter before Fox News.
RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz What's the point in growing the #USA economy if #Congress is going to give the growth and jobs to foreigners.
The stock market loves tRump for the same reason criminals love crocked cops... they know he'll look the other way for a price!
#ThanksObama!
What a wonderful man President Obama is. No wonder ALL of America and the world miss his adult, intelligent leadership.
Wait til you're not riding the coattails of #ObamasEconomy. It's gonna hurt.
A black man did what you never will. He saved America. He already MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN when he stopped another Great Depression w/o GOP.
Dang facts:

No, when was that? Oh right, since Nov 8, 2016. Got it! 
Thank you  Mr. President for leading this Nation back from the brink of destruction caused by the Globalist and  Liberals!
#MAGA



I would add a peeing prostitute over the far left one!
I'm Batman!

SWEET!
And accurate!

You're pretty quiet about the 33,000 jobs lost. Breaking the longest period of job growth in US history. Congratulations.
TRUMP SUPPORTERS SUPPORTED THE VEGAS MURDERER'S  RIGHT TO BEAR ASSAULT WEAPONS RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT HE PULLED THE TRIGGER.
Wow. Broke the baddass meter.

Dear Lou, that crash is just around the corner. Had nothing to do with the incompetency of Trump. Keep drinking the cool aid!
such  lies   by  @FoxNews @FoxBusiness   and  trump
This is remarkable.  Helping consumers, retirees, pension funds.  It reflects optimism for Trump's policies and it's making Democrats angry!
Thanks, @POTUS44  President Obama!
And @FoxBusiness FAKE pres hits all-time HIGH in disapproval ratings @realDonaldTrump SIXTY-SEVEN PERCENT disapprove of FAKE @potus
@realDonaldTrump - I know your happy about the Dow going up, but this is a continuing trend, it was up 195% during Obama's time
It went up every year over the previous year (except one)
Up 50% during Obama's first year
Mr. Trump, could you do something about the housing market loan rate increase?
#ThanksObama
Obama still winning. Nice.
Good job !!! But why I didn't buy some US markets. Grrr !!!
Any else surprised?
Thank you Mr. President for the economic growth

Thanks Obama
Continuing the direction Obama put the market in.Thanks Obama!  Meanwhile your approval rating is lower than ever-only 32%! Record breaking!

Hey, dummy, why aren't you posting this data? 76% of Americans say America is getting worse! http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/ap-poll-just-24-percent-say-us-heading-in-right-direction/ar-AAsZSgo …
@realDonaldTrump going to address the fact zero jobs were created in September, and in fact 33,000 jobs were lost.

Dear Mr. President, Your great de-regulations, your threats of import taxes on our businesses, your new trade policy, & your tax reform
.@realDonaldTrump Jobs are down, where is that tweet?
Wealthiest 20% in U.S own 92% of all stocks. Yes, they're making out like bandits.
I love my President
You owe it to yourselfs to analyze what happened in Las Vegas. They want you to believe 1 gunman did this? 5 min raw https://youtu.be/4BKIiOCr9rg 

That is perfect example of the crooked business assholes that are running the fucking market.
Stocks may be doing great but jobs aren't.
All you care about is #ProfitsOverPeople
Lost 33,000 jobs!

Just wait till they realise cumbre vieja is about to fall into the sea and wipe out the eastern seaboard with a tsunami

 Trump's approval rating slips to...

     ALL

     TIME

     LOW
Based on Fake polls using biased, dishonest surveying methods. They're Wrong just like they were last year when We WON The Presidency!!!!!!!
Thank you, President Obama, for 8 years of recovery and growth.
Didn’t I hear the there were job losses for the first time in 7 years? Waiting to hear your spin how to blame a black president on this 1
Shhhhhhhhhh stop telling everyone lol
You conveniently didn't post about the job loss stats!
False inflation... We will see a market correction soon. Jobs are already starting to fall.
What about the #trumpeffect on violence?  ... add another 58 to the list...
Thank you President Obama!!!
THANK U @BarackObama 
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GUY 
24 fn points your a fn moron
The Ponzi scheme that is our stock market has nothing to do with who is president or what’s going on. Trump is just trying to take credit. 
So glad Obama worked for 8 yrs to build this up from the crash he was handed. You, like the rest of us, get to sit back and reap the rewards
ABC News: Robert Mueller's team met behind closed doors today with an unknown group of attorneys & chief judge of US District Court in DC.
This is far from a typical move for a prosecutor, and it points to something significant being afoot.
U.S. economy loses jobs for first time in seven years in September http://hill.cm/FXee9dw

NEW POLL: Trump approval drops to record low http://hill.cm/GLprsW3  
Fake news
Thank you Obama, we miss a sane president, or even a cheeseburger elected by the people

No Tweets today dear Sir. Praying for you. Love you my President. God Bless you!
theyve been on the rise since 2010.   who was president then?
Obama did play a part in the economy. But it grew slowly under him. Trump just turbo charged the economy. With some deregulation.

Bc the white ppl w all the money are glad you're protecting their interests. Duh
Trump
Chuck W Self is clearly a Russian Troll sent by his gay master Putin!
Thanks for showing what Obama has done for us we’ll see what you can do from this month on.Advisors should of told you that wasn’t your show
So the stock market keeps climbing since 2009 off Obamas policies!  What policies have you passed since Jan 20? Oh sided with the Dems.
That's not because of YOU.. that's in spite of you. Your approval ratings suck because the majority of the country wants you to get the hell out of the White House!
Again, thanks Obama !.
You know the day when white men crossed the water and stole land from it's rightful NATIVE people. Just like your order for the pipeline did
Too bad his approval rating isn't going up!!
I think you forgot to mention this Mr. President!
US lost 40K private sector jobs in September, breaking record streak

33,000 jobs lost in September.
Under a great man. 
Before #ScammyManTrump
Fox News why still employ Hannity after he was telling  lies and rejected for journalistic award?
Market is up cause everyone thinks your next tweet will take you down...and it will...sonethings are jus5 worth waiting for...
I HAVE NO STOCKS!!! You claimed youw ere working for the working class. WHERE IS MY BONUS!?!?!?
Really? How about jobs? They took a major dive, in the wrong direction, for the first time in over 30 months! And under your watch,Trump!
@POTUS along w/Brock Long & FEMA trying to HIDE stats on PR!?
Prepare for the big crash. Good luck Dotards
Why so quiet? Are indictments coming soon?
I imagine those indictments are coming soon.
Those approval numbers just keep getting worse.
You are actively trying to sabotage healthcare with no regard to the lives you are damaging.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness #thanksObama
WORST JOB NUMBERS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION.  MINUS 33,000 JOBS LOST. SCARY STUFF.  HURRICANES DIDN'T DO THAT.
The Dow is going to start following the job losses

What do you say when it goes down, Sir?
EXPOSE WHO WE ARE DEALING WITH:
Thank You, Mr. President, for Saving us from the irresponsible mess of 8 years of Obama's disastrous economy&foreign policy w/$20 Trillion
Silly me...I quickly assumed those were your approval ratings.
Real time gains mean Real Time Profit taking Now....
The market up doesn't reduce the  living costs. It doesn't increase the general public pocket $$ but the rich is getting richer.
@realDonaldTrump can't get rid of the ACA but he & @SpeakerRyan have already LET 9 MILLION CHHILDREN LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE
Big deal only 2% own stocks. The rich get richer

Per pool, Trump has arrived at Trump Nat'l Golf Club in VA.

This is his 69th day at a golf course, 89th day at a Trump property as POTUS.
Funny, #WhinerInChief, I don't recall PRESIDENT @BarackObama patting himself on the back when people in, say, #PuertoRico are SUFFERING! 
Thank you #PRESIDENTOBAMA! for the stock market

Under @realDonaldTrump 33,000 jobs were LOST! So much for helping working people.
