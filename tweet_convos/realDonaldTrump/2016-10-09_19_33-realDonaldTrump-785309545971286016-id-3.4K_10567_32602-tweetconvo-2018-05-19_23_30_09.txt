Due to a number of factors the guy took a plea deal. She didn't get him off. 

@SensiblySecular
That is a concept lost on the Trump supporters who are trying to (and failing) use the case against Clinton

@herb_stamper
@kandeekane13 Come on! Hillary respects you!
 Might as well fact check the whole debate, no?
HRC lusts wealth power prestige for her. DJT already has so which can be bought
We're talking about a guy low enough to use money from charities he set up for legal settlements?

It's called lazy... probably too busy playing online video games. lol @jterryj1970 @lizmcq @DonaldJTrumpJr

march 14, 2016 Hillary says on CNN. She's going to put coal miners and companies out of work. http://www.courier-journal.com/story/tech/science/watchdog-earth/2016/03/13/clinton-well-put-coal-miners-out-business/81750336/ …
@realDonaldTrump  Amazing job MR.President
quote: we are going to put alot of coalminers out of a job!
I fact checked Trump's claim he has almost 25 million followers on twitter. False. He has 12.2 million.
didn't he say Facebook and twitter? As in combined?
#Debates2016 not to mention that her plan would uproot and separate generations of coal miners taking them from home
@realDonaldTrump Good job!!!!
SHE DID SAY SHE'D PUT THE COAL MINERS OUT OF WORK AND CLOSE THE MINES!

@realDonaldTrump Obama and Hillary over regulated coal and drove the price in the ground so Soros could buy most of it.
I remember her saying that she was going to put the coal industry out of business,she wanted a new heat.
@realDonaldTrump.

@realDonaldTrump Trump you killed it tonite,  Excellent job
He wasn't even answering the questions that were asked.

So he cant talk about the question at hand? He decided to bash Hillary talk instead
He has NO clue what is going on other than 2 point and blame EVERYONE ELSE
Because the current administration is to blame!
So where is the solution from him because I didn't one.
Read his policies. it's your right to disagree.
Coal country may have used Trump TAXES too...
she wants to put them out of Buisness
Do you even know what fact checking is? Just about everything out of any Trump mouth is a lie!
check alllll of your dads lies. We don't need a lying, hating, stealing sexual predator in the Oval Office
We DID have one, HRC's rapist, philandering hubby whom I am SURE you voted for. Might wanna fact check urself

Shit attracts flies
CBSN said Hillary made negative coal comment at her March Town Hall meeting check it out
Are the intelligence agencies. She says, claim hacking by Russia, are the same guys who made Bengazi talking points "Video"

@realDonaldTrump they are busy fact checking your bullshit.
