Remove Rino Ryan as Speaker!
Great op-ed from @RepKenBuck. Looks like some in the Freedom Caucus are helping me end #Obamacare. https://t.co/Y2vTnIBT...
WOW! TrumpCare has a chance!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism …
Why don't we cut out the middle man (for-profit insurance companies) & outsource health care to the lowest bidder?
Here's your AHCA .@SpeakerRyan
lets make America great again by another war in middle east
so long as you have something that helps most of the people then it will go forward
Why are you so afraid of anything that has Obama's name on it? Childish.
Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP
for the next rally fund us at

Great news so happy that the wealthy will have a great business with health care while you kick millions of lower income families out.
Reps need to get rid of pork address each problem 1@time no back scratching American people tired of it
LOL  WRONG!!
Story Gorsuch unanimous support as appellate judge-Schumer says cannot support and threatens no coop on anything w Trump-can we go lower ?
end it forever!
we need to end your not my presidency and your and your entire cabinet and KEEP THE ACA
Donny boy, you promised the American people that EVERYONE would have coverage numerous times. Yet #Trumpcare would hurt/kill many #TrumpLies
The Freedom Caucus is the reason that Trumpcare didn't work out. Come on Donny. I am sure Fox and Friends reported the spread. #SmallHands
Bad move going after freedom Caucus
Why?  So you can completely bankrupt every old person in the country?  You are morally bankrupt.
Patriots will always work with you sir, but we will fight being a nanny country. Less fed interference is what we want, including h-care!
No RINOcare!  Repeal.  No replace!
once the far right get as much as they can out of you - then, and only then, will you be removed.
I wonder why we can't make Obamacare better?  Has anyone ever thought of that? Make tweaks to the existing plan, not repeal and replace?
SHAME ON THEM.....
What? I thought you said it was dead....exploding on its on...now you have to END IT. So much NOT WINNING
Buck is in my district and he will not be getting my vote next time.

Pls do a MEDICARE FOR ALL system instead---this is like what Scotland, Canada, Finland and many other nations have already, thanks!
What u are saying is that only rich and powerful deserve or should have access to healthcare - very unChristian and very bad! Sad!
AKA Trumpcare
We do not need to replace it.  Let the market do it's job.  Keep government out of our healthcare!
It's not about you. US ppl  are getting ready to  pre-primary you.
@realDonaldTrump I have been on the Trump train since day 1 as well as @freedomcaucus.  Listen to them on @obamacare @PaulRyan plan not good
YEAH BUT I NEVER LIKED THE NAME - something sounds to gov owed about it !!! Cut out middle man and opm drug dealers and well be great again!
I stand with #FeedomCaucus for #FullRepeal Regulate insurance companies not American ppl Get out of regulating our healthcare!
leaving people with out ins either way is Bad Real Bad just like many other Dtrump ideas waste of a president
Some things should be above politics&a healthcare system is one It's a vital pillar 4 any nation<a healthy populace<workforce=common sense!
Yeah, well, he's not going to die if that fiasco ever becomes reality, so he has that good ol' boy privilege protecting him from stupidity.
the only ideas that will save American health and economy are in the freedom caucus.
Hahahahahahahaha! Even the troglodytes and prostitutes in your rotten, corrupt "party" hate your guts and won't support you! Impeach Now!!!!
BARFFFF
Mr. President, this bill stunk, what the hell was wrong with the 2015 bill? Ryan needs to go
about time!!
I voted for you Trump, but damn am I glad I didn't vote for Ken Buck... smh
You need all the help you can get to just wipe your ass.  Freedom aka tea party radicals, you sure can pick em.  

Show your taxes donnie
SIR, EVERYONE wants to END Obamacare EXCEPT Ryan and the establishment. That isn't clear YET???
If Ken is so proud of supporting disastrous #AHCA why did he lie to us when we called? @ProgressNowCO @KyleClark #copolitics @indivisiblefrr
You seem a little critical of Ken considering #DEMS lie to us 95% of the time! #MAGA #ATWTW #copolitics #cosen #coleg #cogov
What did dems lie about that was this bad? #ahca was a Ryan botched disaster. #dems have plenty of flaws but nothing this horrid (IMO)
You can keep your plan, you will save  $2.3K per family, http://tinyurl.com/mxpu9z7  ... #copolitics #cosen #coleg #cogov  #maga #ATWTW
The friggin insurance co's screwed all of us over. They are gatekeepers who decide what to cover, how much we pay, and who we can see.
Cut out as many middle men as possible,,,It will be cheaper!
F Caucus may be High Minded, but they need to have heart&stop being Narrow Minded&shortsighted.See the Big picture use long range vision!!

@POTUS you are so nice! Once the Koch Bros announced they bought the FC, I can't be so trusting. LOVE YOU! Hugs to @FLOTUS and @IvankaTrump
Just took my wife to get an MRI and since my obamadeductible is so freaking high I had to pay for it. Insurance $1395 w/out $350. Crazy
Me thinks you spoke way too soon!
They won't. We know all you want to do is save rich ppl money at the expense of the poor & Have the poor cover your secret service detail
When was the Freedom Caucus ever not trying to help you end Obamacare?  Ending it is not in dispute.  Replacing it with Obamacare-lite is.
All come to full circle in the end
Don't seek turncoats 4 a BAD bill.  Please do as U promised, B a man of Ur word.
And you still have no answer for the health care of this country. Paul Ryan has no clue. Do you ?
Coverage reform along, without fixing healthcare processes causing billions in cost/waste yrly will not resolve high cost/premium.
Time to get rid of obamacare  REPLACE it now!
Ken Buck will never be reelected. Use him while you can.
hey Ken, have u told your constituents that you're getting Obanacare?? And not paying for it?
Proverbs 16:7
When a man's ways please Yahweh, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
All of you are Liars. Shame on all of you!!
Call for a vote and find out
how desperate you must be! loser! enjoy the rest of your #failingpresidency
@Mrch4ScienceBOS @ScienceMarchFAL @ScienceMarchDC @ScienceMarchNY #ResistTrump March for Science April 22 @SenWarren @SenSanders @SenMarkey
PLEASE AND HURRY I'd like to see my tax refund for the 1st time in over 3
Years 
flip flop
Good! My wife had to drop our healthcare. Premiums skyrocketed to $1,891.00 a month! FIX IT NOW!
Freedom Caucus will come around they just needed wake up call too see that being against things is not enough.  They must produce!
Ur government means screwing the working class and Sucking in more wealth for the 1%
You're so damn focused on stopping one thing, that you're not even focused on current events that need SO MUCH attention #FindOurGirls
You mean helping you cause the death of millions of Americans...
Guess one BIGLY fail wasn't enough for you though 
But the greater majority is working to end YOU and put you in prison with a big guy named Bubba as your roomie, ya putz!
#LockHimUp #Treason
More access 2 gr8t free hlthcare by working 2 add FQHC's & free clinic funding by stipend from repatriation oftrillions of $$
FQHC's and free clinics provide excellent affordable and mostly free health and dental care to all let's find ways to
WRONG!
Total REPEAL is the only acceptable answer. Not the junk in the AHCA.  Get on board with the promises you made President Trump.
No, not really.. You're imagination is tremendously HUGE 
Sure that Buck's constituents will remember this.& his confirmation vote 4 @jeffsessions who is threatening 2 prosecute legalized marijuana.
HELL NO. Listen up. We DO NOT want ur half-assed GOP plan that has higher cost less cover & does not cover ALL Americans. FIX ACA. #SaveACA
Neither Health care bill is any good leave our health insurance alone
Or maybe it was all the people who showed up cause the new plan would have killed them.  But yeah good luck with the GOP. The party of NO
A BAD DEAL is worse than NO DEAL @ all! Heed Freedom Caucus advice & offer a GOOD healthcare bill 4 a change. #people deserve better from U.
Shut the Duck up!!!
You don't give a crap right or wrong, just money power and yourself. The ENQUIRER personal fake news outlet good job wanna be
We don't want worse than Obamacare!
My mom of 91 will be 92 4-2. We are happy you are President. God speed Sir !
Work with @SenSanders towards a single payer healthcare plan.
Good for him!
THE WORST HC PLAN I HAVE EVER AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE EVER SEEN!!
Oops
Can't trust the establishment
Take the deal Pal. Let's Go!
Obamacare is a nightmare for the working class! It's killing my premiums and my deductibles!
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT A COMPLETE REPEAL OF O CARE... JUST AS YOUR PROMISED, PRESIDENT TRUMP. STAND BY YOUR WORD AND IT WILL ALL WORK OUT.
YES YES YES!!!
YES! He is our rep here in CO and you said contact him and we DID!
@RandPaul HC  Bill.......a plan fore we the people.......destroy Ocare.............https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf …
Nothing short of full repeal and deregulation along with free market based plan will be sufficient. Ryans plan fell way short.
The AHCA is the OPPOSITE of upholding/defending the Constitution. REPEAL the ACA now!
Groped for Rep. Ken Buck : "looks like me in there!" : jumps up again : new beam maker.
Keep trucking, make them work and create something that America needs to prosper!
@POTUS @WhiteHouse @SpeakerRyan @psgsr160 Crawl back into the swamp with rest of the swamp creatures.U never drained it U filled it instead.
@POTUS @WhiteHouse @SpeakerRyan @psgsr160 If GOP support your Tax Cuts 4 Elitists it will cause the demise of the GOP. 11/6/18 is closing in
If we replace #Obamacare with something that just helps K street it won't be good for the people. Make the Representative use it too! #AHCA
@POTUS @WhiteHouse @psgsr @SpeakerRyan GOP support your death squad AHCA they will cause the demise of GOP.The Majority won't forget in 2018
the new york slimes
I wish..... seriously  doubt  you will though. Just repeal. Please.
, Screw the citizens and steal their money, #FAKEPOTUS, #FailingPotus
the freedom caucus are the helpers!!
Wait,  you actually read something?
They are with you. Ryan is against  you. Where's you head at
we want a free healthcare market. Allow competition.  We dont want your socialized healthcare bill.
What a joke. You are not ending Obamacare. Giving us Swampcare. #FullRepeal #NoReplace
You maybe should lay some blame at Ryan's feet remember who had your back during election
but even more are working to end YOU. That will MAGA.  You are a disgrace and history will remember u as such
Boo Boo and Boo no to DemoRat Ryan care for illegals
Donald, when you end up in jail don't get married on the first night!

Get rid of Ryan & rest of the swamp #get rid of swamp
End it.. really end it.  Let anyone who wants it rep what they have  open markets nation wide and stay the F outta my insurance
Stick with the Freedom Caucus. I was backing Ryan but not anymore he doesn't stand for the majority
ACA 7 years and going strong. 20,000,000 Americans insured!
Please get Government OUT of Healthcare! 
You aren't trying to end Obamacare- you're trying to replace it with another bureaucratic mess.  Let the states or free market do healthcare
Ryancare is still BAD FOR AMERICA!
@POTUS45 @realDonaldTrump that short bus already left the building buddy.
They are all ! Stop trusting Ryan
You not only do you look insane, you act it too. #OrangeMeltdown #CrazyOrange #Madman45
I voted for you to drain the swamp, not become part of it. Listen to those who aren't selling out from the freedom caucus.

The Freedom Caucus is your Saving Grace.

His Healthcare bill crap!!!
To buy across state lines and preconditions law
