Makes perfect sense, shame your predessessor obviously failed basic math and logic
You know damned well the final buyer is the one that pays all tariffs and taxes.
Wow your an idiot. He said we should charge the same as them.... what's your point? Makes our goods the same margin as theirs why would you leave money on the table?
Justin your the idiot if you don’t understand the basic concept behind cost of goods. Additional tax and tariffs will be passed on to the consumer in increased prices. This will be a tax on the consumer
kid go read any basic economic book its how you create fair trade. Trust me this will only spike our GDP which is good for my portfolio so please catch up
Subsidies create jobs imagine if the dairy industry actually sold in the open market without a price floor. Hundreds of thousands of workers would be laid off since the business would shut down due to supply and demand.
I'm so sorry you didn't take a finance or econ class in college but it's easy to be in the top 1%. You just have to play the game super easy.

You go Trump thank you for understanding basic business.
How about just breaking them up instead? That's how Teddy #Roosevelt handled corporate corruption.
It was simple back then
President Satan wants to raise taxes.
Tariffs idiot
And Vice versa?
tax or we take
if your always on Twitter who's running the country
Him... I know it's hard to understand efficient planning since you haven't experienced them.
, bro, on the topic of money... WHERE IS YOUR TAX RETURNS?
serious biz & a lot of bad hombries
just shut up Donald
when do you sleep Mr. President? #Amazing
notice me donald
Mexico charges us if we try to drive something across the border even though their law exempts u.s. citizens.
Did you hear? Your travel ban is OFF!
their citizens pay those taxes and tariffs. Why would you want to do that to American people? Seriously?! @CNN @MSNBC
we have import tariffs just like every other country, sometimes higher tarriffs. FAKE NEWS!!!!!
yes so true. I agree.
shut up 
.@realDonaldTrump What a VERY interesting thought, sweetie. It's almost certainly not fiscally sound, but that's never stopped my Donald!
you're so annoying
let's grab a beer.
lol we'd probably have fun
I'd sit through it and hear you out.
well we should then.  I'm a good advocate
You know what - nah.
LOLOL
looks like you fought the law and the law won tonight ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

BAN LIFTED!
the only ban that got lifted was your lap band
is this Bannon? He's the only trump supporter left! Lol! #ImpeachTrump
I have a feeling that #Trump is gonna be even better than Reagan for #America & The World..But Not for IRAN&Terrorists
@realDonaldTrump
hahahahahahaha!!!!
#BowlingGreenMasacre ain't got nothing on your Muslim Ban EO that just got massacred #Resistance
but how about this whole judge thing eh Donnie?
US consumers will ultimately pay those. Please buy an economics book, you'll probably want it on tape. #Trump #POTUS
Charge little more Mr. President!
you are missing a 'THE'
We don't manufacture anything they want. Except crazy reality tv stars turned World leaders who don't wear sunscreen.
I wear the BEST sunscreen. Made from the breast milk of a Cambodian virgin. They only sell it in Trump licensed hotels!
to run a country isn't like running your business, fool
Yes, Let Them Feel
Amen!!!
Are you trying to distract from the news that your #MuslimBan was blocked thanks to @AGOWA and the people?! Not working.
So the way to get Americans to build and buy more American products is to make imports expensive again. #goodbyewalmart
Ur an idiot...
Remember this 
#NoBanNoWall #MuslimBan #TheResistance #alternativefacts #WomensMarch  #ImpeachTrumpNow #FRAUD #LIAR
Every time @realDonaldTrump tweets about immigrants, just imagine it in terms of history.
those who agree with U are welcoming A @realDonaldTrump Dictatorship… but isn't that the reason your Deplorables didn't vote for Hillary
#NoBanNoWall #MuslimBan #TheResistance  @realDonaldTrump Why start a war with , why NOT talk about the GOOD
So how does Jeff Sessions really feel about a "Muslim ban"?
There is no "Muslim Ban", get an education.
International trade is so simple, @realDonaldTrump! If only someone with your insight had ever governed the US before!
Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!
sounds fair President Trump.
What about your tax records? Until we see those you have NO credibility.
How are we supposed to trust someone that not only eats KFC, but eats it with a fork and knife?
bot account?
sounds like you need some sort of trade agreement with the pacific rim like a Trans Pacific Partnership or something.
aasholes we grow our own food. Why are we supplementing from other countries who God bless no Trump
bust Oregon!
the ban's been lifted 
that court order will be overruled by morning.
doubt it. The order was executed used terribly, because there was no logistical forethought.
the roll out was bad. The legitimacy of the order stands. It's legal.
not according to the constitution.
the constitution doesn't apply to illegals...sorry
actually it does, there was a supreme court ruling and everything
just make it work. We know you can do it 
Hey goober. That would raise the prices on stuff we import. That's a regressive tax on food, electronics, etc.
tarrifs are just a front loaded sales tax on US buyers. Better to restrict volumn. Increase demand = make in US
that's it darlin sink the U.S economy by throwing around tariffs left right & center, you're just ensuring 2020 lost to u
did president bannon approve this course of action kitten?

You do realize that if you hurt Mexico and their economy suffers, that's just gonna drive more Mexicans here illegally! 
Experts say it will be ineffective. #GoogleIt
Operation Red Dawn. Mongol invasion of China. Walls don't work. Learn from history.
ACLU kicking big fat orange ass Donnie. Five or six wins just this week.
Federal judge temporarily. ..Thats TEMPORARILY!  See you Monday.
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear it & it's very liberal.
US that agree with Trump must contact Representatives. DON'T WAIT..CALL THEM ALL. ITS A GOOGLE AWAY!
they have no say in judicial branch hun. what would calling reps do?
Sorry I'm making costumes for Grands and am racing thru both reading & sewing. Your right of course
i would encourage Trump to work witn Congress 2 pass legislation re: immigration.
Excellent idea. This Presidency has been excruciating so far. I've never seen so much BS from folks.
Prove it. Show the numbers. Name the countries and tariffs/taxes.
Um every island in the world.
@realDonaldTrump look at the fool on the hill
that's my President great job Sir.
Eric Trump’s business trip cost US taxpayers nearly $100,000 in hotel bills
point? You really worried about money now Barry cost the US 10 trillion
highlighting you’re being had. Trump only cares about Trump. Just hoping one day you might see that…before it’s too late.
Andy you really believe that?
I am polar opposite of your thinking but that doesn't mean we can't be friends
also, it’s not necessarily Trump that’s the biggest worry, but the people pulling his strings - Bannon as prime example.
Bannon the white supremacist right. Can you point to one instance of racism?
Yes something needs to be done about that. Hopefully soon =)
great thought, please continue to tweet your feelings to help future impeachment proceedings
Your the minority didn't you watch the election? Good luck on impeachment you have no voice
@DevinNunes And pass the costs to consumers? What kind of businessman are you?
One that understands economics. Tariffs onlyurt foriegn goods. Better lower your tariff if you want to sell in America otherwise our ppl won't buy ur shit. It works every time take a Econ class
#bs
Sounds fair to me!  MAGA!
I agree. Start charging US multi-nationals taxes like the rest of us ... you, of course, don't pay taxes. Correct?
He's smart so no he doesn't. Not my fault you haven't experienced wealth yet. It's amazing btw but you have to play a lot of games
"So called President"
I was hoping for a battle of wits but you appear to be unarmed.
yes yes yes yes! Thank you mr president!
Eric Trump’s business trip cost US taxpayers nearly $100,000 in hotel bills
good! A fraction of the money Obama wasted. Don't you DARE bring up money! Obama gave billions away! You are soft!
I’ll ‘dare’ all I want, sweet cheeks. After all it’s such fun pointing up your rank hypocrisy.
Andy you are a disgusting brainwashed sexist pig and you deserve to die soon. You are dead in my world sucker! Go blow Obama.
death threats? Keep it classy lil Miss anonymous racist. You won’t win out. Tyranny never does.
but please don't forget to bring you own companies to US soil.
ever take Economics 101?
3 Muslim Bros hacked HPSCI, DHS, HCFA -- where are arrests for espionage?

To reunite, STOP anger,occupations,help dismantling Zionist entity apartheid"ويسألونك عن الجبال فقل ينسفها ربي نسفا
even if prices for consumers in US skyrocket so middle class can't afford smart phones?
Amen.
@POTUS not so much. There is so much more to being a leader in the world order than PAY PAY PAY.
That's kinda like what I call d "smash mouth" politics can be!! U treat me right? U get n return U don't U get in return!!
explain to me how the consumer (me) doesn't endup paying for the tax or tariff?
@DevinNunes Two American traitors.  You should both just blow away like dried up dandelions.
such utter bullshit.
#whinylittlebitch
especially on the stuff that you and your family bring into this country
Rules equally applied is how trade works best. If you want tariffs, here have some back.
If laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world.
Most mature comment ever
Total fake hysteria. Show us some stats you DTTrouble fake trouble man
Show your taxes!!! Show YOUR TAXES!!!
You don't want to see them. Cuz then you'd want him to be king and we can't do that

only your rich friends could afford to live in a world you envision, but that's what you want. bye bye middle class.
whats that petro dollar thing all about then?
We will murder anyone that try's to set they currency with oil just read about gadafi and sadam.
when you say 'companies' do you mean your companies? Stop using your position to make money..
Yep Donald, go for it. You will tank our markets in 6 months.  Go Win again
Lmfao someone doesn't understand the market.
With your customs policy they will harm their own economy in the medium term. German companies are not afraid.
American pleads for democracy to countries where there is democracy and for this there are the Gulf states who know democra
Basic economics taught in HS!  Simple stuff in an attempt to keep a level playing field! I get it!
Yes we should!
May the man with plenty share with plenty to maintain plenty. God will always provide for a cheerful giver.
I'm not offended by what you say. I'm just glad that you're stringing words into sentences now.

Your mother's teeth are so yellow, I cant believe it's not butter
True. The US imposes tariffs on Chinese goods, but they are not as high as Chinese tariffs on US goods.
that's why we voted for u President Trump to find a solution.
your autistic, right?
yes sir mr president
Love i!  Goose and Gander
. @realDonaldTrump
ur fucking right about that. U import 20 mil worth of goods, we export 20 mil worth of goods.
He always finds himself lost in thought; it's unfamiliar territory.
that's fair
Make sense. But you need to focus on this problem, not on your stupid ego
wow, thanks Mr President. Now I understand the rules of foreign trade - you really can dump things down! World is so easy.
Apple will now be making phones in India! This needs quick action by our President. I know you can change their minds!
that's a sure fire way to raise all prices for example everything....
sure, doesn't effect the 1%, only the middle and low income families who's costs for goods and produce will go up!
At Least!
I feel that will be happening now that we have a President with common sense!!!!!!!!
@ralphee212 Finally an intelligent President.
Agreed.
so very true.usa needs to charge higher taxes or tariffs on countrys bringing items into usa
too bad you don't know what is going on.
says who?
Mr. President, this would show that we are not about splitting up families, but the rule of law must be followed!
Don't forget the use of quotas, too.
We will soon Trump Tower aircraft airport
You're the reason women beat their husbands
no kidding
Starting a trade war would a very bad thing for my state of SC - we export a lot. And voted heavily for you Sir.
totally agree
absolutely!!!!!
the American voters said do it. Hit them hard. You better do it. This is why your there, I want common sense.
Foreign companies with subsidiaries and operations in US pay taxes in US. Get your facts straight.
please, if we all tell you that your hands & crowds r big will you let big boys make economic policy? Bc we will.
if you knew anything about international economics, you wouldn't say this! What happens if THEY stop using the US dollar?!
amen!
Please mention the people in disaster are of New Orleans and help them.  God Bless you
Your mom must have a really loud bark!
Mr truml the left is trying to monsterize  yu and make violence acceptable,  do not succomb to them yu are for the people
I'm sorry, were you brain damaged by the Bowling Green Massacre?
this will only increase American payers cost. It will not serve anybody else other than your government? Who are you penalizing?
but with u here it won't be the same it will juz be worst
it's the only reason you ran so you could pay your collectors
@DevinNunes Thanks for claiming who you actually endorse though. Btw, executive privilege does not apply to pre-election.
What would you say if there was a call for social media to boycott American goods? In response to your protectionist policy
Bring dividends to US
facts please? how about a table showing actual import duties?
How does it work for your stuff made in China? Do you claim prima noctu or something?
NO- the reason we don't is so the middle class can get goods at a reasonable cost! Are you ignorant of all laws!!!
you don't know what you are talking about
charge on Mr President
Sure because Americans want to pay more for the imported products....we are all so rich.
Wow. I feel like you just learned how to speak during the days of the cave man. Do you also grunt within all of your
let's make the foreigns pay their fair share
What they charge us, WE SHOULD CHARGE THEM!!
Great post and great thinking. I support you.
