You are a national socialist! Why any "limited government" conservative would endorse you is beyond comprehension.
The decent Republicans HATE you, Dirty Donald
I'm surprised @kasich hasn't been in 1 of her adds yet.
HE should be in a box of Fruits Loops add ,only
It could be he's just to busy going door to door for her.
So we need another Scalia to take this country backwards again.
Don't worry boss, we'll make sure they'll never forget it.  BOYCOTTS and VOTES still work my friend. #MAGA
Are you for a Liberal Global Union such as Hillary/Obama/Kerry have stated? Just answer the question please!
Donald do ever listen to the nonsense that comes out of your racist mouth!
Hillary a nut - to think in the past I would have voted for her then - along come POTUS #no2 nut vote DONALD TRUMP 2016
Don't worry about them.  Be yourself  and continue what you're doing.
WE WILL REMEMBER      DON'T FORGET THE GOOD GUY-MR "PLEDGE TAKER" KASICK      AND OTHER "GOOD" REPUBLICANS
They are RINO's
what do expect from the clowns  like them they need to put D by their name
Romney is like yesterday's toast .
GOPdemorats lowercase Demorats !!
How, specifically, will Mr. Trump stop ISIS? @HillaryClinton has an actual plan.
If you could pilot your helicopter solo you'd make a more perfect villain. #NeverTrump #ClownTrain #DumpTrump

.@realDonaldTrump
Let the TROLL WARS BEGIN ! #BASKETOFDEPLORABLES
Pretty sad when you own party can't stand you.
Well, you're pretty embarrassing. Let's be real. @realDonaldTrump
Giuliani: Trump crowd would go wild over real call to kill Clinton
I give them props+respect for not standing with you. Real Americans. Country before party. #FDT.

really sad that u are a Republican
country over party. They are true patriots. You are NOT qualified to serve as leader of the US. #DumpTrump
GREAT response. FOCUS on WINNING the WH!!!  They will LOSE - change election. Keep up the OUTREACH/POLICY! @KellyannePolls
RT if you think Prez TRuümp is the best! Each RT is an actual vote. Each like is a thumbs up!
Romney is trader working for crooked Hillary. 
TRUMP 2016!!
Reinforces what a DISASTER a Trump presidency would be. You are a danger to the US & the world. Go join Putin's regime.
Delete your account. (via @trumpdelete)

sadder still that presumed billionaire, birther,  and ignoramus is the best the GOP could do.
do we need to be reminded why Romney is a loser
if you lose this is all over anyway, but assuming& rooting 4 your win, what do theses numbnut "GOPs" think their value is?
You've been running for President for 452 days and still have not released your taxes. #Sad
That's all the libs have against Trump is tax returns? He never had a prob. With taxes & been audited yearly
No problem, DT calls his own shots that's what intelligent people do
I answered U didn't listen do u have a mental block? U keep saying the same thing, hang up
It is very sad and MADDENING!!  Especially Romney, who you financially backed and campaigned for.  What an ungrateful jerk!
Being mean is very different from having the potential to start World War III
The people he refuses to rule out using nukes against, for example. That includes Europe
He also wants to force countries like China and Mexico to do things they refuse to, which they probably won't be happy about
Why wouldn't they? They definitely won't like him more. Are you saying they'll be afraid of the dangerous decisions he may make?
#Sad

16yr old says he supports Burhan because he fought for Islam. Look how Barkha Dutt tries to put Kashmir in his mouth 
all real Patriots stand with you Mr. President! Don't worry about those turncoats!
@frespirit01 they will be punished we know who the puppets are now! Globalist supporting globalist
 #TrumpDayCareActivities #TrumpIsTreason #TrumpRussia #TrumpsTheWorstPresidentEver
Flake: "Reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as 'telling it like it is'." 
its a soros video, he controls them all.They are reason Congress ratings are so low.
tried to crush the power of Gods Spirit, God will NOT let that happen
your Tweet was quoted by @nytimes
more sad for you than them
Drawing attention to the fact that he can't get the support of respected Republicans. Sad!
why don't you add a tax to all the Money Wired to Mexico each week that get sent over there by all the Illegal immigrants.

@VoteTrumpUSA  They are Globalist. Republican and Democrats are just a front . They all want a one world government.
THEY SEE AMERICA TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN PARTY.
Dallas Morning News: "We recommend Hillary Clinton."
check out Hillary and see who is the real traitor
Republicans can vote for Democrats and Democrats can vote for Republicans! Doesn't mean they are any less of a person!
Does Trump realize that most Clinton ads are just clips of him speaking?
#HamsterHands
Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!

Jen, search #whitegenocide and #altright and see how many bios include a #Trump endorsement. Enough said.
Wow you ppl fell for that, Really!!!
Those aren't Republicans. They are Neo-Con dogs like George W. Bush.
Triggered another liberal. #9 today.
Release your taxes.
@pig4801kj You're correct, but let others raise that point. Stay focused on Clinton. We're pulling for you.
This really hasn't aged well.  No indictment,  ever!  LOL.
.@realdonaldtrump Make sure Trump JR doesn't retweet his white supremacist friends today. AWKWARD!
This is the best you can do dems?  Criminals and liars are bad, mmmkay?
You're not a patriot
he loves America
Donald Trump is a fascist
they have you brainwashed! Be proud of your country. We need to take our country back. Put America first
You don't dispute my points because you know that I am correct
not at all! I have to work today so I don't have time for stupidity.
I accept your apology
go back down to your parents basement
this is no longer Democrat vs Republican.....it's Insider vs Outsider.....you got this Mr. Trump you have my full support!
Outsider is right, it's like he's from a different galaxy.

*you're
.@realDonaldTrump really sad for you, yes. It says a lot more about the sad state of your hate filled campaign.
this chump: @realDonaldTrump 
That's how Twitter replies work.
wtf is "tweeter" and why do you keep repeating it?
You are deplorable.
says a Killary supporter? Who is the most deplorable piece of work
Funny, I don't recall ever saying I was a Hillary supporter.
oh pardon me  sorry you sounded like one
I am not. I just don't like Trump who lies on a daily basis and loves dictators who murder their own people & invade neighbors.
Humm that sounds like Hillary if you ask me that woman lies even about lying but oh well
You should hate Trump too then.
nope I don't I'm actually part of the basket of deplorables 
they are just RINO onlys
Just hate not being in control.  The problem is, we are losing the Supreme Court for poor Republican sports.  sad
be great again.
Winning feels so good
#trumpmonkeys Apparently they have a human brain. Unlike T rump monkeys.
They don't care, all about keeping the scam going of taxpayers money, what do they care about SCOTUS?
Oh shut up.
I will!
@cbeelman They sickening and believe me Graham is done for sure
@GeneMcVay which is still a vote for Clinton! R they crazy! If they do either 1 of those things they r crazy&I'll remember!
I will remember if any of these morons come up for a vote.I will vote for their OPPONENTS instead! Don't support traitors!
There corrupt, dont want you disrupting boys club
Trump ignorant and stupid! Remember.
We don't want bigots taking over SCOTUS. Good for HRC!

She also used O'Reilly and Krauthammer in the first one she released. Have either of them mentioned it?
I can't respect these people. They are the worst helping Hillary in the campaign. This is my last vote I am ashamed of them
No, Don, it's just that even they see you're a bigger threat to the country than a liberal SCOTUS is.
sad your party isn't radical enough for your ideology and idiocracy
says the man who's talked about each one of these republicans including lyin Ted, his wife Heidi and Cruz's father
Flake lives up to his name.
What's worse? People who lie or the fools that believe them? Dishonest people feed on the ignorance of fools.
@LindseyGrahamSC Yes! Remember that #Trump only likes the judges that let him skate. #Unfit
don't call people names... It makes you like childish!  Reel it in... We need for you to WIN!!  Be likeable! NOT arrogant!
just how bad they think of you abd that smart brain , big con don , u can add my name to that list
look at who funds there elections and you can see why.Romney just soar loser!
scared
Hillary must have promised them a few "favors".
@LindseyGrahamSC They will wake up day and find themselves out in the cold! #Women4Trump
Speaking of Supreme Court. What's up w. $100K donation to Citizens United? Support Dark Money? Plutocrats United?
I don't think they are Republicans. Not sure what they are.
they do not care about the country only their political careers like most politicians.
they should all be ashamed of themselves!

You're sad
What's really sad is when your OWN PARTY WON'T STAND BY YOU!!!!!!!
People are probably not aware that they have to sign off on it. We need to get the word out.
So many defectors in the Republican party who hate you and do not want their names associated with you.  Too many to count.
.@realDonaldTrump It's really a shame that YOU would allow yourself to be used in a #Clinton ad. Sad! It hurts, doesn't it? #FirstAdmendment
I stand with Trump now and have washed my hands of the Republican party. If they have no backbone I won't be voting for thm
U R next Supreme Court Justice will b Barak Hussein Obama... 
They are far more fearful of your becoming president! They are wise folks...
at some point you gotta blame the teacher not the student. #youaretheproblem #trumpsucks
they all just told the truth about you. No real Republican supports you. You have used lots of people and hurt a lot also.
@aWoman4Trump #traitors None of them will be reelected. #shameful #NeverHillary
Words out, no reelection for them
Donald u missed the message they are standing up for there country again a prankster


@rninfl they"all"suck,anyhow...let them"keep-on-suckin'"!!!...
they are disgusting and do not belong in the Republican Party!
those clowns aren't Republicans. Or, sadly, maybe they are...
We lost respect for those not following Trump/Pence!
The real shame is more Republicans aren't strong enough to stand up against your bigotry
They are not Republicans, they are libs. And friends & assoc. Of Clinton's & Bush's,  etc. Maybe people will Vote them out
they are no good anyhow
Hillary Threatens War With Russia https://youtu.be/k4aIIpCDsLU  via @YouTube
No, sad is allowing you to call yourself a Republican & take the party and country down with you. Thanks @LindseyGrahamSC
anything to stop you anything at all
Yeah it is really sad, but not for them but for you!!!!
A joke!
They're all a bunch of sell out RHINO's!!
get help
true Republican's or turn coats.
President Trump with dip brain, Hillary sick might "look" good in your campaign to send flowers and wish her well? Maybe?
Not only SCOTUS but all of the lower appointed Federal Court positions too!
RHINOS. Now we know who they are. Thank you for helping the conservatives know who to vote out.
just have a plan to get the RINOs out of office
Evidently, they are willing to put their careers and their good names on the line to speak against nonsense and racism.
sad
Lindsey lol gives Graham a rich name. God needs to test him more.
Really sad you are such a lying fraud that you get sued 1 time every 3 days over 30yrs.#NeverTrump
Trump will defeat hillary clinton
I MISSED THE AD, MUSTA BEEN ON A NETWORK I DON'T WATCH.
Please remember, they are not really very intelligent.
They are the ones that should be dumped.  The news media made you all promise to support the winner.  We know the liars.
really sad 4 u that yr own party is rejecting u- good 4 them-they have principals & r tru 2 wht they believe
#Term Limits
Just watched Reince telling Sean there may be actions for these Repubs who signed to support Repub candidate. Shame onthem!
@slapthebully These cucks should be kicked out of the Republican party.
Really pathetic  !!
is that a threat. Are you threatening your own Party Trump. Now that's sad.
Trump is desperate. Using Supreme Court to con Reps. But they r smart. They will not allow the US to be controlled by PUTIN
it's absolutely horrifying the thought of trump being president. .
You are correct! It's amazing how Hilary supporters have no morals to ignore everything she has done!  To long to list here
they care more about getting Hillary elected trump would find out to much about them and tell the people
Really 
Really
it's not sad. It's telling. And it's telling me that right thinking people run away from you.
The real truth? @realDonaldTrump funded the 9/11 terrorist attack

#BasketOfDeplorables
@TrumpPenceUSA1 The aforementioned people should be ashamed of themselves
Only a Rino like Meg Whitman and McCain advisor Mark Salter could justify endorsing #CrookedHillary
did any of them really work for a living?
boycott Starbucks !!!!!!!
you are in all of her ads that's airing in Fl. They are very effective n great ads.The words that u said .Pathetic!
there not republicans to me anymore
Its called country over party trump!They aren't ready to give a vulgur  bigot the nuke codes,that's what that is!
Graham wouldn't make a pimple on a good presidents ass and Loser Romney is just jealous Hillary can have them
great ad wasn't it? More and more Republicans are coming out against you or won't vouch for you, imagine that! Lmao 
@MaddieAndMichi Absolutely never forget... And while you're at it remember Justice Antonin Scalia
#PutinPuppeteer
They are not republicans theyre ass kissers.
They're the Globalist traitors who want to destroy America to fatten their own wallets by controlling trade, wages, people!
the greatest cure for sadness is a loaded shotgun in your mouth and pulling trigger!
agree! What a disgrace!!!
so many tweeting about football &Trumpers tweeting politics diehard versus the hypnotized I like sports - I don't live 4 it
- They all have one thing in common - "A Fear of Challenging the Establishment" - #TrumpPence2016
did they even listened 2 HRC humuliation speach Friday? They don't care 4 our country or us. I'm very disappointed n them.
Yes, remember that we need judges who will protect all, and  not just straight white old men. #CrookedDonald
