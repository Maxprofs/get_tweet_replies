he sure does. It you're able-bodied, good looking and not flat chested.

God bless you Mr. Trump but let's get a moderator in there that is non-bias and let's get those questions asked of Hillary
: Will never happen. She didn't get any questions about anything. Not one scandal. Not the FBI report. Foundation pay to play.
because they have been investigated numerous times and the same conclusion reached. It's a non-issue.
: Both Clinton and Obama caught telling lies according to report. Emails, server, etc. he knew and she used bleach bit.
which report. Please send the link.
: It's been proven that Clinton used a company called bleach bit to erase her server and then destroy emails.
big deal. No evidence of her servers being hack.
Trump, as an unbiased former "Bernie Bro" who's undecided, I thought you won the debate
Donald Trump was unprepared. He interrupted constantly. Gave very few policies. Admitted paying zero taxes.
i would pay zero taxes if i could
Yeah? Watch our infrastructure crumble, abandon disabled folk, empty our public schools & Uni Etc. #Logical
most people try to pay as little in taxes as they can, do you agree?
I agree but those who would choose to pay NO taxes are irresponsible & criminal.
he's a scumbag for sure but the taxes thing doesn't bother me. but i can see how it would upset people
where are you from & do you pay taxes here in the US? Tax evaders who make billions off the backs of others should bother ya
ALL POLLS HAVE TRUMP WINNING. MEDIA SAYS HILLARY WON! #maga #debatenight #hofstra #trumptrain #maga #bernie #hillary
you know online polls aren't scientific or in any way representative of the public, right?
no, online polls are meaningless, as stated, seems you don't know what a scientific poll is?
All an online poll can tell you is which base spent more time online voting in online polls. (4/4)
@hankpannell @nypost stick to issues lower taxes more jobs lower crime close border
Biggest clue, they're in a bar. #drunk
HILLARY TELLS ENEMY EVERYTHING SHE PLANS TO DO #maga #debatenight #hofstra #trumptrain #maga #bernie #hillary
HILLARY LIED AND #CNN COVERS FOR HER #maga #debatenight #hofstra #trumptrain #maga #bernie #hillary
HILLARY HAS BAD EXPERIENCE. ALL TALK NO ACTION #maga #debatenight #hofstra #trumptrain #maga #bernie #hillary
How can anyone vote for an incredibly selfish man who isn’t interested in helping other people (I’m “smart” avoiding tax)?!
@nypost drunk perhaps? http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/29/opinions/clinton-trump-not-binary-choice-rye/index.html …
@Shamrock1i @nypost Drunk people aren't known for good decision making. 
drunk or sober - you know my feelings #TrumpTrain #TrumpPence16
@nypost ya he likely licked their assholes and paid them a million bucks each
did you pick up the tab?
@nypost loserdonald
WAS IT BAR DEPLORABLE HQ OF THE KKK?
SHOW THE PEOPLE YOU PAY TAXES TOO. OR DO YOU
@nypost Because they were all drunk?
Yeah, but how did they feel when they sobered up? #YouAreLosingDonnie
@nypost lol glad you won that one bar, according to the shitty paper owned by your son-in-law!
ha..funny! He's up in the WHOLE STATE! 
hi you are an idiot
that's intelligent
you seem very smart, you racist illiterate bedwetting loser with 300 followers
When you resort to insults it means you lost — by your own account.
@nypost 
@nypost of course he did.  Did you doubt it?
lol yea ok SURE
@seanhannity @newtgingrich @KellyannePolls 
 It's totally irresponsible for Trump to not prepare for the debates.
It's flat wrong and irresponsible to squander other's chances. DT doesn't only belong to TD.
@erictrump @ivankatrump  Someone please tell DT that he lost the debate. Pls prepare the next 2.
@maleniatrump  Brain does not work well if U sleep 4 hrs/day. Sleep more!
EMAILS RELEASED FRI BY FBI SHOW HILLARY EMAILED 1000 TIMES W HEAD OF CENTCOM #debatenight #trumptrain #bernie #hillary
that's something to be proud of #classy #trashy #ImWithHer

@nypost there were probably only 5 people on the bar. Only 3 mentioned in the article.
@nypost  and winning the bar patron's vote is high on the credibility ranking. Bar patrons have such incredible ethos.
They were drunk!
They must of been drunk!
@nypost way to go PA VOTERS!!!
looked and acted high last night. 
Observe the post - it means after-polls- Trump won every poll except CNN- a collection of dopes led by Wolf a nit wit just like u
Online polls you can vote in, refresh the page and vote again and again and again? Get real.
Well. What now??!!
TRUMP IS CHANGE. HILLARY IS BIZ AS USUAL #maga #debatenight #hofstra #trumptrain #maga #bernie #hillary #cgi #varney
lol! More like chump change...
WE WIN EVERY POLL BY LANDSLIDE EXCEPT @CNN WITH ONLY 26% Rs hahaha #maga #debatenight  #bernie #hillary
Selfish Trump doesn’t care about others. He’s always trying to sniff out more money for himself.
how's Venezuela doing?
Venezuela has a leftist-run profit-driven CAPITALIST economy. NOTHING to do with socialism (a society with NO ruling elite)!
lol Cuba also history.
You are bragging about a bar, where people were DRINKING? XD
good morning mr. Trump please refuse the moderator they send pic one who is fair,u have the ratings to do so,msm will shit
@nypost Hillary ended you
@nypost WTF hallucinations are you taking? You're campaign said you were a disaster. Were you using your big brain again?
@nypost Win over the unsophisticated. Clever plan. If elected, you'd continue your destruction of the country. Woe is we.
Heard millennials don't understand MAGA. They thnk it means racism, intolerance, anti-feminism. Make case to them.
@nypost DERANGE!
Thats hard to do!! Run off at the mouth-say nothing-act like and ass-show a lot of false bravado-that should work 4 bar ppl
@nypost alcohol...only drunk idiots would follow a cheeto out of a bar
@nypost

RT Trump won new supporters @realDonaldTrump: 'How Trump won over a bar full of undecideds and Democrats'
http://nypost.com/2016/09/26/the-best-debate-takes-come-from-inside-the-bar/ …

@nanajudyr @nypost Check you will find out!
@nypost looks like they were Decided before the debate or they were too drunk to appreciate the beating that HRC gave DT.
#alcoholpoisoning
@nypost They would have to use alcohol and alter there consciousness to support this ass clown.
I agree with new don't go to the gutter with Clinton. Go to the high side
@nypost That never happened.

@nypost I didn't know you could get THAT drunk
@nypost they were drunk. It's the only logical reason a Democrat would agree to vote for the shyster.
maybe they were drunk.
@nypost Trump paid dumb redneck's drinks til they were too drunk to think straight. Ahahahaha!
@nypost nothing good comes from the drink
@nypost why don't you check into the fact that crooked Hillary's father had ties with al capone.
@nypost

@nypost

@nypost At this point, Donald, undecideds are nitwits and shouldn't be voting for anything.
@nypost Trump really does bring out the scum in America
They must have been inebriated.
@nypost just how plastered were they? Trump lost the debate bigly. In 3 or 4 days the polls will make that crystal clear!
@nypost they must have been drunk
Enough with liberal media... Let's boycott them, starting with canceling New York Times subscriptions.
@nypost Because they were drunk!  How was the cocaine, Don!  No wonder you Sucked. #DebateNight #trumpzanidiot
@nypost these people were drinking. Wait till they sober up!!
Hillary had a wireless earpiece. The photo is on the Internet. It was on her back. Surprise, cheating again.
Anyone that votes for you is either a backwoods idiot, high or drop dead drunk! Or under the care of a Physiatrist!
Yeah........about that.......he DIDN'T!! LMAO!!!
they were drunk and didn't know what they were doing.

They were drunk.
@nypost Dig deep Donnie dont forget Drudge and Dumbart had you winning yuge.  The CNBC poll is just Larry Kudlow answering
I agree with these undecideds and Democrats. 30 years and $20 trillion with nothing to show for it. Good job in debate.

Maybe Millennials don't remember Bill in the White House chasing skirts, but u don't have to state that let your followers
you looked like a child up there. There has never been a less qualified candidate in US history. You're in over your head

Hillary is a woman finished corroded by envy. His father was a lousy businessman and envy achievers.
