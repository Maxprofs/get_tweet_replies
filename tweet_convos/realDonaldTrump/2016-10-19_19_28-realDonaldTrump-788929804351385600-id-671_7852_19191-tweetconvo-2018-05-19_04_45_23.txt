Anyone could be a great businessperson with a million dollar silver spoon starter package.
four bankruptcies; how many people lost their money huh Mr con man? Trump university scam? Bribes to prosecutors as well.
your biggest fan, can I have $500,000 please
Your knowledge of issues is clearly missing. You epitomize the phrase, "Ignorance is Bliss". Start a new reality t.v. show
he's the only 1 talking about real issues, Hillary's reading from her prompter & selling you a bunch of lies
Hecho En China! #DopeyDonald #GOP @GOP #Debates2016 #TotallyFuckingBatshitCrazyRacistMisogynistMoron

Your campanies NAV business rating is 19 out of 100.

Hacks like you.
I caught you on tv tonight! AWESOME! You ROCK! #DrainTheSwamp

@DefundMSM 
All business needs is for the government to get out of our way, way to many regulations
yea we need change but you will not be around when we do it got you're ass handed to you by a woman and lost all 3 debates
Bankrupt
it is a corrupted election with visible interference  on Tv shows & even on social media they need you  to sell themselves
Be strong Mr.Trump It's not over until  we win

maybe Ivanka wants to hang out with me , ya never know ... everyone likes doing there own thing
same for small business owners with the processes of over regulating us. We can't compete with Big Corporations! Help!
if filling bankruptcy and failing to pay your mortgage makes you smart business man we don't need you to be our president.
politicians get advice from businessmen / politician to engage in politics it's not always the tangible you negotiate for
Then how come your companies went bankrupt?
What! What? Are you saying that during a board meeting, the door opens and a bunch of senators walk in a finish the meeting
We don't need you!

So true that's why we need Trump to turn this thing around
Trump should have replied by saying, how come public still hasn't seen the pics of Bin Laden being captured, etc.???
In debate, Hillary referenced she was in "Situation Room" when Bin Laden takedown was taking place.
Thanks to lousy Trade Deals, politicians allowed Chinese steel to be dumped here putting own businesses out of work.
Hillary referenced Trump uses Chinese steel in his buildings. Chinese steel has so much lead in it, you cannot weld to it.
YES WE EXPECT PRES TRUMP TO NEGOTIATE GREAT DEALS FOR USA.NOV8 MASSIVE GOP LANDSLIDE VICTORY
will remove the people's reps from the negotiating table and replace with biz lobbyists. Do you even understand democracy??

My father used to say, “It’s OK to be dumb if you know it.” You get help.
#BigLeague the only word Autistic Donald uses today
Thank you for pointing this out.  those making policy on bus. are not in real time.
You are one of those hacks that negotiates in your favor, hurting people while lining your own pockets.
More than that:  We let unelected bureaucrats make the laws.
ur NOT including u in greatest business peop right..what happened 2 Trump airlines, beverages, the game, wine, casinos etc
business people that does not include you.
The USofA is not a business.
It's a country.
We're not a profit making entity beholden to owners.
Refreshing to be told the truth, even if it may not be popular. She stood up there & lied like it was her job! #TrumpPence
taking money from foreign powers,just to win elections
that's true
strange.. less government for businessman but more between a woman and her family/doctor....hmmm
Yes because the top .01% have always been motivated by what's best for the working poor and middle class.  #biglytruth
you are not one of them!
comrade Trump is not a great business person. Look at all his failed business ventures
@petefrt - She's upset Putin's crookery for Trump. How about, her Uranium gift to friend Putin? and the DNC's crookery?Oops
this country is a democracy, not a business! Delusional!  Deplorable!
Hell'ary stands corrected
and your not one of them!
You just insulted your workforce if you become President

you lost everything you gained in the debate stupid move!!!
you should've said you would except the election results!
UNHINGED !!!!!!
so we should let the biggest hack of all deal, you.Don't think so#BIGASS!!!
living in a Trump Cloud, delusional!
How many businesses have you run into the ground?
you have a set of balls, you bribe the Florida AG on dropping charges on Fraud charge, you are lucky thats not brought up
you are not the change we need
Vote @realDonaldTrump to #MAGA #debatenight #debate
u can't run America like a biz. I know ur only goal in life is the best biz ever, u fail at life, don't take America w/u.
let it go Donald just admit defeat
I'm not waiting in suspense. You're an insignificant, whiny little tittie baby.
I thought you were a #HACK, heard you at #SanFrancisco 1996 #LLearningAnnex "get rich" conference-- I PAID NOTHING AT LEAST
@gracy69epixnet But you are just a plain old hack
.@realDonaldTrump It's called conflict of interest, JR.
Name 1 example of how you'll do better. Hint: the president doesn't set the price of imported Chinese widgets #OrangeCosby
flaunting taxes personal greed- looking at you buddy!
we don't need you and that's "big league"
How many years and business does Hillary have? #maga not #insidethebeltway #professionalpolitician.
and you need to hang it up cause you got destroyed last night plus your tailor is very very bad, like really really bad
Yes to change! Down with the business people who put business before people. Down with you! Yay!!! #truth #4moreyears
#She said some beauties
but you ain't one of those businessmen. You depend on daddy for bailouts. #BigLeagueTruth
Yeah, we need the guy with 6 + bankruptcies. That would be awesome!
Like how you took all those tax breaks you are 'allowed' to take?
it was a great line. So true!
Too bad none of the great business people are running. A bankruptcy jockey lacks the right experience to run a country.
Yep so letting an entitled rich kid with no IQ.
My cat is smarter than you. She actually answers questions
Whiny Wittle Don
your definitely correct about what's happening in Europe
And you are NOT one of the great business people. Failed businessman. Phony facade as one though.
#CORRUPTMEDIA #CORRUPTHILLARY YOU WILL WIN, US DEPLORABLES ARE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE WH!
Those stinken Lobbiest Sir i think there is the Problem there like Brokers for Foriegn Crooks
that's the truth, I could never understand why we keep doing the same thing or worse and expect a different result, INSANE!
You DO know  throwing around the words "BIG LEAGUE" makes you sound like a cheap huckster don't you? Google huckster.
http://youtu.be/SYoOPgeTMQc 
hypocrite, how many jobs have you exported? Liar.
#youreadouche
Not very good at business then are they... A good business person could negotiate a positive deal no matter what!

DO U KNOW HOW2TELL IF A PERSON HATES THEM SELF? THEY PROJECT THEIR EVILS ONTO OTHERS, EXACTLY WHAT U ALWAYS DO. PONDER IT
@stk6678 there's no country in the world where business has so much power in politics as the US either.
you are so sad!
lost $1billion and you are smart!
bankruptcies, cheating workers & small businesses, admits to being a voyeur peeping on young women & unwanted touches.
yes but you are the worst business person in the world!
Exactly!!!
You'll bankrupt the country like you bankrupt your businesses.  High spending + low taxes = ballooning deficit. No thanks!
Thank goodness you're not on that list of sharp business people!
#deludeddonald - you just don't understand
We do have the business people in the world and you have not one endorsement from any fortune 100 company CEO!  Funny!
Wanted: Negotiators. Requirements: At least five bankruptcies.
Seems like you are the "political Hack" Mr. Trump, seriously. Has anyone ever told you they feel like slapping u in the lip
incest in Washington is killing this country.
then why are all your goods made overseas???
You are right! It's such a shame that you couldn't stop attacking Hillary long enough to tell us what your plan is.
America also has terrible businessmen like @realDonaldTrump who take advantage of corporate bankruptcy when they fail & for Trump mult times
These should have been delivered at the debate - most eyeballs. What happened? U got our vote still
and Trump is the biggest hack of them all...
