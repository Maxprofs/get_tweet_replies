Actually Mitt Romney proposed it. If Repubs had done their job, the healthcare act would've been amazing. #whinyrepublicans
Hillary es una amenaza,esta loca.El FBI deberia detenerla
how does she run the country from prison?!
And before that it was Richard Nixon care, which also profited off of sick people.

Exactly right. If you have time you might make a commercial using Gruber. Remember his saying they lied to get Obamacare?
.@realDonaldTrump actually it was called romneycare
Wrong! It's still the "ACA" and #RonaldReagan started it. 
#TheMoreYouKnow 
No it was called ROMNEY CARE. Hillarycare was MORE progressive and closer to single payer
They want $340 for just me per month and I don't get any $$ to help form govt and I make 35 K per year.
OBAMACARE IS BS!!!
find something better then. Wait, what?? Nothing out there for you?? Wonder why?
im in college, and even when I graduate with 300000$ in debt paying $340 is still way too much
thank goodness college is so affordable. You could still go on your parents plan
Obamacare is NOT rising for the majority.Its rising because insurers mispriced their plans in earlier years.Get it right.
and what happens if your health insurance is unaffordable to the 30 million that now have it?
Actually, before it was called Obamacare it was called Romneycare, but lying obviously comes pretty easy to you #LyingTrump
Obamination is the better word
- Old Hillary is like Merkel hellbent on delivering their countries in the hands of the Muslims.
Government HEALTH CARE , it's the only way, you have to go LEFT of CENTER to help the people.that need it.

since he is controlled by anger, hate & money!

hope they don't have O'care b/c they couldn't get an aspirin for the headache they just got from FBI/Wikileaks
Obamacare is not failing Donald!

U will be the winner
MEANT TO FAIL HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE HE WAS LUCKY 2 HAVE A REAL JOB ON THE OUTSIDE THEY SENT HIM 2 THE WH 2DO THERE DIRTYWORK
And before that is was called Rockefeller care.
YOU GOT NOTHING
b4 it was Obamacare it was #Romneycare in Massachusetts #NoClueTrump #neverTrump #Imwithher #VoteBlue across the country üõá
It was actually called ROMNEYcare!
Why are HC & Ob. so determined to force O/Care on the US if it has failed? What is it they don't u/stand?
No it wasn't, you melting candle of a man.
We all know that a 25% rate hike means a 50% rate hike in Democrat speak.
I love my new healthcare, thanks for giving me another reason to vote Hillary!  You're the best :)
How'd that work out for you?
This isn't even accurate...
both are correct. In fact, here in Arizona the premiums will go up 116%. Before ACA was Hillarycare. Look it up
Call it what you will. And be sure not to blame congress for not adjusting the bill.
Obama knew quite well it would fail. Single payer here we go
I would love a single payer plan. And I get great insurance through my employer. Insurance companies suck.
I had great work insurance then I got hurt, lost my job To young for Medicare too much for subsidies
That sucks. I talk about a lot of people in similar situations. Why I believe insurance should be NFP.
It kind of has to be because capitalism rules. There are no fixes for ACA. It only benefits the poor.
It's a slavery bill that will put the ruling class (who are exempt) in charge of EVERY aspect of our lives. #NO!
It was Hillary Care before it became Obamacare!!
TRAITOR TRUMP DISASTER!!!!! AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE WILL BE GONE. DON'T LET HIM RUIN AMERICA. LOOKING TO TURN IT INTO RUSSIA
And Republicans have had 50 years to do something about healthcare but did nothing. ACA needs adjustments. Stop inhibiting
if you're going to put out memes, get them correct. ACA was never what @HillaryClinton proposed. It was Romneycare.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76rxpKm3m4 ‚Ä¶
my co pay went up 150%, I guess that's bc city workers are so loaded that we should start paying our fair share? #sopissed
Another lie. I would have voted for you, but you for some odd reason lack the ability to tell the truth.
Lying crooked hillary is a hypocrite who sleeps with LESBIANS according to Yoko Ono. hillary hates all men because of Bill
Lookin Hag H's got a "head"ache, as in Monica L Billy C stuff on dress didn't have SEX with that woman=HillaryCare?
Current Gov. Adm. Is tax the stupid people.  Cause segregation of the citizens as they destroy democracy
The basic fact is Gov. Is not capable of managing any program.  Continous spending of money they do not have.
Oh no, Hillarycare was even worse than Obamacare.  Very unamerican. God forbid she wants to use that plan to fix Obamacare.
once again trump not giving correct facts. Lie and fear to control the  sheaps that fall for lies.
i would say its the doctors big pharm and corporate pigs like you jacking up prices so insurance has to pay more.  Hmmmmmmm
They are literally taking food out of kids mouths, and taking away their chances for college.  #TrumpPence16

That's a lie they are going up a lot more than 25% 110% in Arizona
And before that it was called Hitler's T-4 health program
mine only went up 13%, not so bad
@WERStanford I now pay extra to avoid Obama care at all cost!!

NO! it was called Romney care! and it worked in Massachusetts because republicans didn't water it down!
Actually it was Romneycare. You want single payer. Don't you trumpy?
@russmove My husband saved lives 4 29 years N fire dept. Can't afford these new rates!
liar
well that's a lie I do not ever recall having to enroll In Hillary care
ObamaCare  came from Edward F Kennedy, not Obama not Clinton. Google it.


cant they just build a wall around them?
it was called ACA and originated with Gingrich and Romney in the late 1990's.
she was hung over when she did this...
@LouDobbs PLEASE HELP US! Im afraid for my family! We wont survive!
#draintheswamp
/ We need to repeal and replace the Affordable healthcare ASAP. Otherwise it will suck out the regular people hard money.
It's called the Affordable Care Act...
.@realDonaldTrump #FuckYOuTrump... #liar & #uglyNastyBeast
Actually, it was called MassHealth, and Romney designed it.
Dream on, MAYBE you will wake up from your nightmare soon,let us hope, it's getting loud and Ridiculous
You don't even know how #Obamacare works... fool
@madigan_smurf LOOK AT WHAT WERE PAYING FOR, ITS A TRAVESTY
Yeah that's when it worked when it was called Hillary Care, until the Bush family ruined that.
remember, you're so clueless you thought your employees had it.
YES, HillaryCare was the single BIGGEST DISASTER IN HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS...EVER!! COST...BILLIONS!!!

@Sweetladywv
and before that.... romneycare!

Never stop talking about this - you were right all along and the people know it.  Go Trump!!!
All insurance rates are going up not just ACA sourced rates. The sham is GOP is rejoicing over the increases.

now wait a damn minute. That's not true. It was formerly known as Romneycare. Not surprised to see Trump lying though.
WRONG
I thought this was a picture of two people after listening to you trying to speak an entire sentence in English.
Yes. In 1993, as soon as she & Bubba entered the White House. That led to the great Repub victory of 1994. @PoliticalKathy
Now Obama doesn't won't his name anywhere near aca
Republicans wanted something very simiar to obamacare in the 90's when the clintons were in office.
#wednesdaywisdom #wednesdaymotivation What more do you need to know.. #VoteTrump and #MAGA3X
Seriously, delete your account! Everybody knows "HillaryCare" was about single payer. Obamacare is an appeasement to GOP
that's the story. Hammer her with this

#News @realDonaldTrump #Hawaii #808news
Continue putting your name on buildings that you had nothing to do with. You are a joke!
You don't even know what your company does to provide healthcare. How the hell can you fix it when you are so out of touch
Working people paying for non working people. The math doesn't work. Go figure!!
A friend of mine posted a bill from OBAMA Care.. How can people believe @HillaryClinton  and @POTUS  DISGRACE both of them
