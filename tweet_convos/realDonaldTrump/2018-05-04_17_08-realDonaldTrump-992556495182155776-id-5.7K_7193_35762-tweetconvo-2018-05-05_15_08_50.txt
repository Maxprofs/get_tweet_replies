I love my President!
How about a shout out for
Dr. Jerome Corsi and his book
"Killing the Deep State?" It's an amazing read Sir! You would absolutely love it.  @jerome_corsi 
#MAGA #KAG #KILLINGTHEDEEPSTATE #DRJAMESCORSI


Every day I am embarrassed that America chose you to be our president. You are a disgrace to the office. We deserve better.
Have a small sense of comfort knowing that Trump wouldn't be the POTUS without colluding with Russia. Have a great sense of comfort knowing that Mueller will bring the swift arm of justice and gut punch the treasonous traitors! Voters need to handle the complicit GOP in Nov!
Great America cannot be a refuge for fraudsters . Great America shouldn't  protect a fugitive who has swindled 30, 000 people&took away 13 billion Yuan. @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @NYPDnews @HillaryClinton
I prefer Comey’s book but thx
You’re always known as a piece of shit.

So here we are 
How is the losing going?

Nice polls. Lol
Books have a lot of words - great words.Sad.
Promoting books so people think you can read. Brilliant
Guys! Look at this cake inside the Barnstable Brown #Derby Eve gala!! It’s amazing. @courierjournal
Do you get a percentage of the sales? Only reason I can think of for a corrupt man who’s acting like he’s president to be promoting a book.
He's actually scheming to knock the various anti-Trump books from the Top 10 list.  Won't work.
with a book written by a wife abuser...no thanks
I better book is put out by James Comey! A must-read! Also watch the documentary on the trumps. Shows the genetic line of cheating lying and Breaking the Law of every opportunity.
Does it have pictures so you can understand it!
Resign
Great book coming out soon!  trump "family" always known and crooked leeches.  Will be big hit - pre-order yours today!
Seriously.. You read???
Did he go through 5 bankruptcies like our failure president, too?
Nobody cares about your book club. Let’s talk about how you spent the day kissing the ass of the NRA. Let’s talk about how you lied to the American people and likely committed election fraud.
.any movie recommendations for the weekend? have you seen 'West World'? who is doing weather reports? ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Didn't know you could read!
LIAR..... You don't read
Please give Martin Shkreli a Pardon, Ily Mr President 
Mix three to five drops essential oil per ounce of carrier oil. Then, apply it to the skin in massage or inhale it through a diffuser. Do not .... 
Read full usage here 
Try this book!
A family friend had an idea: Send a copy of my book to Trump (in FL - he's never in DC) with a short note of praise.  He just may read it then (or have someone read it to him I guess).  Send a copy to someone you love or a Trump you hate.

…
Thank you, Sam! And, Donny, don't worry, I'm sure you can find somebody to read it to you.
IF they can maintain their employment long enough to get through the book. 
Don't BUY.

I can't READ!
Everyone knows you don't read, you liar.
Who's reading all these books for you?
Ok, so...in order for your recommendations to actually help with the book sales for your minions, the people who trust you would need to be readers. Like, book readers.
Perhaps cave paintings would be more apropo! Lol
What page are you on?
So this guy has two things over you. He's a successful businessman and he can read and write. Got it...
Are you trying to start a publishing company or something? We all know you don't read. What's with all the book recommendations lately? I'll read a book you recommend right after I gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon! 
You don’t read, why do you keep recommending books?

.Hey, #socalledPresidentShithole #Trump, have YOU forgotten about @AndyPuzder having to #withdraw from the #LabourSecretary #nomination because of #DomesticAbuse allegations documented by his #exwife on the #OprahWinfreyShow years before? Now YOU'RE trying to help his book sales?
.Of course, #DomesticAbusers stick together, right? I really think you should read #RussianRoulette by @Isikoff & @DavidCornDC. I'm just double checked & it's available in #AUDIOBOOK!!! Yay, YOU won't need anyone to read it to YOU!!! Enjoy #FakePresident #Trump. When done #RESIGN
.After YOU #resign #socalledPresidentShithole #Trump, YOU won't wanna see or hear anything being said about YOU, even on @foxandfriends & @seanhannity, so YOU can catch up on some other books. How about #Trumpocracy by @davidfrum OR #ItsEvenWorseThanYouThink by @DavidCayJ? #HURRY
Against the law for the President to have any conflicts of interest which include posting personal advertisements for friends....Just putting it out there
You mean for most presidents.   This one is being held to no standards because,  well, I think America had lost its damned mind.
Yeah this is like a 15 dollar parking violation in the life of #Trump's illegal activities
Why is this dude promoting books when there's a potential serious war brewing
ineptitude of his...
Are our salesman or president? Stop advertising; you are an ambarrasss ment
Greedydick
Go to bed!

Still 39% approval rating dotard 
BANE FORTNITE
Nope. Capitalism has failed everyone but a few.

Day #468 of the hostage situation. Hostages listened to a program on NPR and heard that a huge percentage of citizens in the US read at or below a 4th grade level, most are pretty sure Evil Captor is among them.
@jamesalandarby
Unfortunately we all vote at the same grade level. 
Capitalist comeback huh? Is he given a ton of money from his father, manages to lose it all in the only surefire investment that can’t lose cuz house always wins but yet finds a way to go bankrupt, then gets bailed out by Russia for laundering money

Who read it to you little donny?
How would comrade Trump know? He doesn’t or can’t read!
Is the POTUS supposed to be publicising other people’s books? Are there no more important things to do such as running the USA properly?
Never mind that trash give the White helmets the funding back
wasn't he accused of domestic violence?
That would not matter to this jackass.

‘I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, 'Be rougher and you’ll see a different relationship.'"-Trump 

A different relationship...like a battered wife?

1. You don't read.
2. You can't read.
3. Even if you did, you can't get past 1 page of a national security briefing.
4. Isn't government employees promoting marketing ILLEGAL?!
The White House is considering finding a role for Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump’s first pick for labor secretary, who withdrew his nomination in February after old allegations of domestic abuse resurfaced, according to three people familiar with the discussions?????
Why don’t you read us a few pages... oops, sorry.
He read from a pamphlet when at NRA speech! I was shocked! Of coarse it was about him!

Do u get kickbacks?  We all know you can barely read
Did you read the book, or did your buddies on #FauxNews recommend it? #FoolOnTheHill
I make it a practice to NEVER buy ANYTHING I've seen on infomercials.
"My book report is on a book called 'Huckleberry Finn'. It was written by a man named Mark Twain, though this was not his name. Ironically, Huckleberry Finn was neither Finnish nor a huckleberry. I would recommend this book to anyone."
Capitalists never went away, you don’t read, and the 1990’s saw the genesis of “The New Entrepreneur.” That’s why Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are so much more successful than you.
I’d like to take this opportunity to say you’re a lying SOB who’s debased our country, and I’d rather be dead than buy your abusive friend’s book. Have a lovely evening.
Unless it has the word Trump in every sentence , we know you didn’t read it.
This week, many of my followers and I followed your three (3) easy steps to be a BILLIONAIRE. 

We are now all BILLIONAIRES just like you!!!

Not nearly as big as Comey’s book about our corrupt president.
Some explain why the president is promoting books ???? There's a war going on
Trump is getting a cut of the royalties
We all know you can’t read, Grifter Don! 
You and your book endorsements something you're not supposed to do . Quit acting like you already read them because you haven't you just think that they shine you in a good light I'm so weary of your nonsense are you hurry up and resign #TrumpObstructed #TrumpRussiaConspiracy
The words "trump and boom" are in the rest of the title.  Boom.

Donald Trump speaking at the National Rifle Convention (NRA) in Dallas saying it's like a war zone and places like London and Paris would be safer if everyone carried guns.

The same Donald Trump who donated to the IRA weeks before they bombed London.

Hey Spanky! I would be much more impressed if he was an economist and not a lawyer who ran restaurants and appears on @FoxNews.  Appearing of Fox taints him as a propagandist (i.e. a barefaced liar) just like you.
Another fine selection from #Donaldsbookclub. Here’s how to qualify. Include his name in the title. Make it sound fawning - the more the better. Get featured on @FoxNews, preferably @LouDobbs or @FoxandFriends. Don’t expect him to actually read it though. Reading is for losers!
Puzder is the bozo who is opposed to minimum wages, and had to pay a $20 million class action settlement to his employees over cheating them out of overtime pay. Similar to you Trump in that he was cheating people out of money he owed them. Not a good businessman like you aren’t.
Yeah, might be a big hit with the 1%, the rest of us poor Bastards could care less about a #FakeBook!#tRump seems to have his base on this thread, you know the #tRumpanzees and Baboons.Definition of Baboon, Baboons have a dog-like muzzle,a short tail,and bare calluses on buttocks
Damn, the definition of Baboon describes @realDonaldTrump, he's got to have bare calluses on his Yuge Buttocks!
You’ve never read a book in your life how much do you get paid to promote somebody’s book?
Well since the words trump and boom are in the rest of the title....
You are not supposed to promote books while being president!
Another scratch and smell book?

DAD CALLS OUT Anti-Trump Teacher Who Marked Down Daughter For Not Bashing President Trump 
The only way to stop the constant indoctrination by activist teachers is to call the media to expose them.…
Nah. Not as big as Comey's book
Sadly I laugh and worry every time you endorse a book. I, worry and wonder, when you’re going to start burning all the good books we love instead of the lame propaganda narrative crap you spew upon us everyday. #Dictator
And now...a commercial break from our President.
You don't read.  How would you know?

#Resist #ResistTrump #TheResistance #Dotard #FakePresident
Let us know when it sells more than Fire and Fury.
PS get my new book "Sparklers and Upset".
How many #bookofthemonth presidential endorsements are you giving in May?
Ivanka replayed those words over and over in her mind. They'd been among the last her father uttered before everything fell apart. And she'd now been on the run for over six months. Refused asylum in practically every country on Earth. How had it come to this?!
You are composing a credible view of the future with this series of tweets. Or a really interesting Netflix series.

They love to MAGA...............No matter WHERE it takes them.

A man who doesn't read is hawking a book to people to can't read.
A. Capitalist never went anywhere. 
B. Who will read this book to you?
I think this is why so many ppl are writing books now.  They KNOW the president doesn't read.  And Can't be bothered to read!  Notice how everyone else is reading and writing books. ..crazy!
You don’t read so a book recommendation from you is a joke.
Haha. You endorsing @AndyPuzder is the kiss of death for any hopes he had of a best seller.
Putzer should’ve titled his book as “#PutinTrumptov’sKriminal Kapitalist Kleptocracy,” w/ forward co-written by @GOP heads @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr Turtlehead McConnell & midnight Trump Water Boy @DevinNunes. @GOP “Hooverville #TrumpDumps Depression” coming soon!
Oh, Putzer is from Red Tennessee...no wonder 4 his @GOP Repug #ScorchedEarth world view on kapitalista kleptocracy & fossil fuel raping of environment Don’t worry u’ll see Trumptov FUCK UP economy WORSE than Hoover (1929), Reagan (1987), Bush I (1991) & Bush II (2007)
Thanks sweetheart. That’s one I won’t buy
Is this the picture book or the coloring book? Either way hard PASS
Is that the same Andy Puzder who withdrew his name for Labor Secretary because of domestic abuse and hiring an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper?


This is funny because we know your broke ass can’t read.
Are you now going to concentrate on the big boy work that Kelly asked you to do ?

Lies lies lies - one every four hours - great job dotard
How big a hit can it be? You just endorsed it. You are like the polar opposite of the NYT Bestseller list. It's like the Midas Touch of failure!

Have you read it?
Nice! That’s all I care about: Was the businessperson successful, or, a no good unsuccessful loser? Nothing can be learned from any failures EVER. Success at any cost or you can forget my buying your damn book. Fuck the inverse of success. Anyway, sounds like a good read.
You know that books are meant to be read ? Recommendations from a guy that doesn't read ?? SAD #LiarInChief #FakePresident #Grifter #TrumpCrimeFamily
Even greater book

He also knows how to abuse women. But then you LOVE abusive men don’t you?  Disgusting
You don’t read. What makes a book great for someone who can’t read?
trumpy trying to push another book even though he knows, if it doesn’t come with crayons, he can’t read it. LMAO
Why don't you just go ahead and advertise your favorite hotel.
They warned us

You keep mentioning all these books! You watch tv 1/2 of the day and and golf the rest. I bet you haven’t read any of these books!
You are so obvious.
You know what books are currently occupying the top 10 list.
You want them bumped.
Won't work.
You don't read, your base doesn't read.  ?
Oh yes. One of Trump’s failed cabinet nominees who had spousal abuse allegations against him. Thanks for reminding us of your horrible and dangerous judgment.
Tax bill and other items will be fixed when dems take both houses! I will be called veto proof majority .dont need impeachment polical castration better! Enjoy! NICE!
Pretty sure that Dr. Suess books would be too much for you.

Is spuosal abuse and sexually harassing employees part of the key to success?  Can’t wait to read those chapters.
Another pamphlet from another cronie.  

Stop debasing the office of POTUS by using it as a platform to sell your co-conspirators propaganda.  What percentage of kickback do you get?

#RESIGN @realDonaldTrump 
One of your best deplorable nominees. The wife beater? He was the first right? Hard to keep track.
Lol!!! Like you read!!
We know you have never read a book so your endorsement is meaningless to anyone who actually does.
You keep promoting your friends books, but we all know you don't read. So, the pictures are great?

And how exactly would you know? You don't even know how books work, let alone how to read one.
Obama gets zero credit for helping the unemployment reach record low. #Trump #ObamaFailed
How do you know it's a great book? You don't read, not even contracts. Youi determine EVERYTHING, people, objects, rules, based on whether you like them or not. Zero intellect. You should be a Wal-Mart greeter.
Did the book have pictures?  Maybe pictures of naked women?  We know you don't read and your only interest seems to be sex, porn stars and money.
If by “successful” you mean he beat up his wife, then yeah, sure.
Why are you acting like your presidential office is a QVC show for merchandise you agree with?
With YOU endorsing it; the writer SHOULD worry! You’re a FAILURE in ALL you have ever done! Besides, you can’t even read! LOSER!
Who do you think you're kidding? You don't read. You must've agreed to do this ad for a percentage of the profits. Oh, I just checked this guy's bio, and I see your name is in the book's subtitle, so you probably threatened to sue him for using it unless he cut you in on it
Who are you trying to kid?  You don’t read books. You sure as hell haven’t read our Constitution. If you claim to have read it, your comprehension is toddler level at best.
Heard Lisa Page resigned is shame right after the Comey cover-up news hit yesterday. That is Not So Special Anymore FBI Agent Peter-head Stzork's whore who he fucked regularly in an extramarital affair not to mention Coup member.
Lol, as if you read it. It’s well known that you don’t read books, or have any intellectual curiosity.

Who are you kidding? We all know you can’t fucking read anything longer than a tweet.

When you say "great book", you mean it's a bad book. According to this:

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5aeba767e4b0ab5c3d6394b5/amp?__twitter_impression=true …
Dude! You’re under multiple Federal investigations and so is your lawyer. Now is not the time to promote a book that you won’t read because well, you can’t read.
Just stop it! Everyone knows you haven't read it, so don't promote it. You're the biggest con-job that your country has ever seen (and heard) ad nauseam.
@AndyPuzder who had to withdraw as Labor Secretary because he too is a wife beater? Who had an illegal immigrant employee? Who REPUBLICANS found so vile they blocked his path to an appointment?  Yet, here you are promoting his book.
The way you and the #GOP are defining "Capitalism" is the same as "Robber Baron Capitalism" Such as invading Iraq for oil or passing a bill to give yourself taxcuts. While "Constitutional Capitalism" would implement policies that created an environment where "all men are equal".
You don’t read, who do you think you’re kidding? Only your supporters who don’t read either?

Damnit Donald, we all know you never read. You have the vocabulary of an eight year old. By the way... Mueller... Stormy... Comey... Cohen... Giuliani... Tick tock, Donnie Boy.
A better book for you to follow: The Bible!
You know, you shouldn’t recommend a book that you haven’t read, and since you don’t read, well . . .
Wow, other people can make money on writing a Book, everyone but James Comey. Why? I’ll tell you why because he says your not fit to be in office and you don’t like it. Someone who can fight with you. It’s simply amazing how you treat people you like and the people you don’t like

There were no meetings with Russians, except for the meetings with Russians. The meetings with Russians were not abt Russia, except for the parts that were abt Russia. There was no follow-up after the meeting with Russians abt Russia, except by ppl who followed up after meeting.
You never read any of these books, have you? You just hear they might say favorable things about you, so you hawk them. Like your loser Vodka.
Trump! You don’t read, you simply are not a credible book critic!! Sell toilet tissue, or hair products or truth pills! Ha ha ha, ok that was mean!

No a great book is Russian Roulette, that follows your Russian collusion
Are you getting a piece of the action on all of these books you promote? I'd bet you are. Corruption is running unchecked within this administration. #TrumpCrimeFamily
Too bad he's a spouse abuser!
Give his ex-wife a call and see how successful he is!
Remember Dumbo Donnie, he had to withdraw from your nomination because of his past history of abuse!
Is he "successful" like you--with lots of bankruptcies? Lots of failures?
Why the promo? Did he mention ya name repeatedly ? How fragile we are when we constantly need reaffirmation ! #sad
Since when did the duties of the President include shilling for a guy who couldn't even gain GOP support to be Sec. of Labor because of his record of abusing staff and hiring undocumented workers?  The #LiarInChief strikes again.
