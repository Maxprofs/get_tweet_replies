Failing?
Salesman of The Year award  goes to @RealDonaldTrump for helping to boost subscriptions to @NYTimes, up 69% from year ago
You spelled "game of thrones" wrong

Congress: Hillary Clinton Set To Be Investigated By Special Counsel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-buayyMFAQ … 
I still think Mueller is investigating Hillary and Bill too!!!
fox and friends are your only pals, cuz you are bad and no one likes you!
MSNBC has taken Faux News #1 spot in the ratings Rachel Maddow is up for two Emmys for excellent reporting. O'Donnell & Hayes up for Emmys!
If you say it, it must be true, right, Donny? 
Well this wasn't true...just sayin
Yeah, the majority of people do not like Donny right now, not even his BF, Jeff. Breitbart took a side on it and they like Jeff bestest 
You know Mr Trump maybe you need to spend a little less time tweeting & a little more time learning to govern
I don't have cable. Is it a kids show?  Cute fox and his pals?
Can't wait for your impeachment and the inevitable cancelling of fox and friends
How much money are you paying Fox News to boost you up? They're the only fake news I see. Go live in Russia where your puppet master is.
Since @realDonaldTrump has so much invested in Russia, Putin will continue to pull Trumps strings!
Who watches the lame FOX and Friends?  Sycophants and misinformed... #SAD
They remind me of the Bunny on Captain Kangaroo show, beat their collective heads on the table in support of anything Trump!
I'M WATCHING THE "VOTE" AT THIS VERY MOMENT ON C-SPAN 2.~REPUBLICANS HAVE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY~WHO ARE THEY LOYAL TO~U.S. OR SPECIAL INTEREST?
UNITED WE'LL STAND STRONG-PROUD-FLOURISHING~DIVIDED WE'LL FALL & FAIL~WE INVESTED OUR FUTURE W/REPUBLICANS~IN GOD WE TRUST AS OUR GOP MUST!
Hey liar!  How about tiny job announcement hiring for Mar-a-Lago? Now you say there are no Americans to fill the 70 jobs!
O King! They art only one in many talk-shows, and less of a News-show. Thy mayest decide to look at real News such as Rachel or Lawrence!

Peggy Noonan brought it!!! She rocks! WSJ
You're dreaming.  Two Emmy's to Rachael Maddow and an Emmy to Lawrence Odonnell!
Laser focused on health care.
Here is a shit show to watch....
#Mueller....If you are listening....

#TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily #Impeach #FireproofMueller #Russia
The love of money is the root of all evil. Been thinking about that one a lot lately.
I am genuinely concerned for your competency and mental health.
Fox is fake news.
Yeah, because you watch it every morning and tweet your reactions to it; which end up becoming policy. They're not wrong.
Heimlich maneuver required at NYT for that statement.,
your interview with the failing @nytimes
I fxxking love you
@foxandfriends stupid and low viewer show. NYT is America's most respected paper. Your approval only 36% chump.
@bringitovahea @nytimes @foxandfriends Agree! GREAT WAY TO START THE DAY-along w/strong cup of coffee!
https://twitter.com/libertyselfgov/status/890676366042988544 …
Fox and Friends is a fucking joke
Now I call THAT fake news! Fox is nothing but a bunch of carnival barkers for the Trump Shitshow!
"The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,"
Period.
*hides behind bush*
Don't worry, your impeachment should fix that.
Please fire sessions. I'm a huge supporter!!! Please. He is the wrong man
Did you understand the context?
It's because you watch that children's version of "news" and think it's real.  It is not!
SHAVUA Tov señor presidente Donald Trump. Adelante. La república bolivariana de Venezuela es inviable.
Resisterbee is more like a gnat. All insects though.
Make it clear the only FAKE is YOU
I guess you would know all about Failure after this week huh?! More Good Times about to be rollin in for ya. #Soon
The value of the failing @nytimes stock is up 70% since your so-called election.
They are the most powerful TV show in America because they tell you what to think and what to say.
You are too dumb to see this is an insult
You keep calling them the "failing New York Times". SAD. The only thing that seems to be failing is your presidency.
They didn't say it was a good thing. When fox influences a generation, we get a fool, in the White House. Sucks for US.
Ahhh. FOX NEWS the original fake news.
I keep thinking of that 'sugababes' song when I think of you
"push the button" 
These negative tweets on the press are not fooling us. You have caused so much drama within your administration, they are doing their job.
LOL. You just don't like the truth. FOX and Friends is not news. It's white house propaganda.

You would know about failing. Healthcare Border Wall Tax Reform. Sad
So u trust the opinion of failing @nytimes, which u hate, regarding the only org u like? So is that 1 success for failing @nytimes ?
#clown
If the NY Times is "Fake News," isn't it dishonest for you to cite them in your feed? U can't have it both ways. #FailedPotus #TheResistance
SHUT UP AND GET TO WORK
President Trump the best President in my lifetime!!
If they are failing, why do you keep talking about them instead of letting them quietly disappear?
I think Mueller reads the honest #NYTimes .  You should too.  #maddow
NYT digital subs up 63.4% from a year ago. Stock  trading at a nine-year high, market cap of $3.2 billion. #NYTWinning
Please stop tweeting and govern you're the president of the United States for god sakes do your job
The most imature 70 something year old is our President! God help us!
Fox News needs to have the FCC pull their license for reporting fake news. Trump is all fake, a washed up reality loser.
Fake News for fake President, Fox News not real, not powerful.
Seriously, u realize they are saying most powerful because you watch Fox and Friends and believe every word?
But aren't they fake news? Thus that would be a lie meaning Fox and Friends is NOT lost powerful TV show. Can't have it both ways Don!
Not fox and friends - the Rachel Maddow show is the top show on cable. You should watch it - its all about YOU!
another question - if WSJ and NYT are so terrible WHY do you invite them in or call them to give interviews?????????????????????????????
It was a criticism, to bad you don't read.
Delusional! FUCX news is the worst !
Get your act together you poor babies!
Wow! The fake, failing #45 thug shows off his brainlessness
The "failing" @nytimes
If you hate the NYTImes, why do you have someone read it to you? Move on and back to comic books. You lOOOve pictures.  Pass the cookies
Let's see... you called NYT "fake news"... does that mean to this quote is also fake?  Should be, if you're correct.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH STFU
Thought you didn't watch TV! Hmmm interesting. We know you don't read...what are you doing? Watching @Rosie 
Fox and Friends is the ship of fools
Those linking Trump+Fam to corruption/collusion. Where was their copious consciousness when it came to Hillary+Hussein? Why now do they Care
Fox is the most powerful fake propaganda in America.look what they did in london, they lose broadcast PERMITION in Canada
Don, you keep saying they are failing, but nothing happens...you are a projector...a purveyor of fake news
Repeal and replace McCain and the republicans who voted No. McCain is No Hero to the Party.#TraitorMcCain
It's Fake News, isn't it?
Apparently Donny, you don't watch much HBO...
The failing president of the US is being investigated for collusion with Russia for cheating Americans out of their voted choice
WE THE PEOPLE ELECT THEM...BUT THE FRICKIN MONEY CORRUPTS THEM (THAT IS...IF THEY ARE CORRUPTABLE)
@POTUS you're not Republican or http://Democrat.You 're American patriot in charge of the most corrupt political establishment#FIRE&FIRE!
You work for All American not Fox... Sad @Morning_Joe @washingtonpost @FoxNews @nytimes @MarkWarner @RollingStone
NYT is right for once! I can't start my days until I watch FOX & FRIENDS!! Congratulations! 
how was your dinner with @seanhannity?
WOW - failing Trump....  that's a shocker...
Wow failing President that no one likes approval rating is dropping lower then his 71yr old balls said Ivanka
Now that's not fake news for a change

Well, the failing US presidency is the most watched reality show on TV, so I guess it all fits.
And for this awesomeness #evangelical
Yeah because they keep lying, about, and flattering you!
Put all Congress on Obama care it ll get fixed in a day
Didn't you grant them an interview that started this new funfest?
Yes, that is probably true sir, but Murdoch tried to do you in before, and tells people like Shep what to say as well. Fox= fox, sly tricky
President Trump, if they are failing why did you grant them an interview??  I'm a supporter, but help me out?  Why?
Fox is fake news
#MAGA MAKE AMERICA GAY AGAIN
Who reads that paper anyways?  FOX is about the only reliable news source outside like #rightsidebroadcasting and a few others.
Wow, the Failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends "....the most powerful T.V. show in America."
You have to be kidding. Studies were done on the Network news & Fox anything was number 1 for telling lies & faux news. Laughing at you.
Seriously, you need a makeover. No offense.
I think the #GongShow is more popular
You agreed to an interview with them, failure meet failing
Dude, you need to fire your political coach, you're sucking it up with this bullshit
So #fragile your #ego is.
Nah you are wrong, again. It has fallen to #3 #Maddow is #1. Liar, liar pants on fire!
So if the @nytimes is failing, why do you do interviews with them?????
Fake Fox News is failing. Ratings in the toilet 
Most powerful because they speak directly to you and from you. You both regurgitate the other. And call all actual news outlets fake news.
The FAKE NEWS never tells the truth . This should be a
FCC violation.
.@realDonaldTrump Rachel Maddow is up for 2 awards & Lawrence O'Donnell is up for 1. They know the real U not the one created for your fans.

@foxandfriends is your own personal propaganda machine
Wish I had your free time so I could read @nytimes and watch @foxandfriends! I have to work!!  What about you?

Just because you say it doesn't mean it's so. In fact, generally the opposite of what you say is true. Hummm.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-transcript.html …
Wow. You keep saying @nytimes is failing yet do an interview with them. Sad
You all need to delete your accounts.
DJ, I know you don't actually know what success looks like,  so here's a pic.  Too bad your businesses couldn't "fail" like this. #TrumpLies
They are right
You're a joke, and history will remember you for the monster that you are. Also, your father will never love you.
I don't like you
Get the quote right please "suddenly,  for no other reason than it's #1 fan, it is the most powerful TV show in America "
Really, it is your opinion @MSNBC @WashTimes
Scaramucci needs to be fired. Sarah Huckabee Sanders needs to step in with her no non-sense approach.  We need less drama in the White House
Wow, the Failing #FoxAndFucks the most garbage T.V show in America has the worse ratings. The great @nytimes is the most powerful news in US
Wow, the failing #FakePresident is inventing his own #FakeNews (lies) & #AlternativeFacts (also lies) about @nytimes &@foxandfriends
And the @nytimes is failing so much that... you care desperately about their approval. Makes sense to me.
Trump is a FAILURE!!!!!
Absolute disaster President.
Quit before USA goes down tubes.
They certainly act nicer & more polite than other news shows.
Fox News is your propaganda news outlet.
They got on the right side of good they rode the right horse
Wow, the failing president @realDonaldTrump (#KingCuif) keeps calling out the @nytimes; begging for attention, is he?
Hey there bone-spur man
Took the cowards way out of Vietnam
How can you judge the brave
When Ivanka is the only Trump who shaves
It was an insult directed to you. Subtlety lost on you! SAD! BTW @nytimes--congrats on record growth!
THIS WAS A PAID AD. Why did you lie to US citizens? Its like someone w/ $ taking out ad saying TRUMP SUCKS & saying NYT reported this. #liar
As you can personally attest, having power doesn't mean it's deserved.
"Failing @nytimes"? Stock up 73% since election, helped huuugely by your constant whining about #fakenews. #maga #tcot  #trumpRussia
take that back jkjkjkjkjk
I like one America news no jawjacken.
Just kidding FOX I still watch some programs
The SUCCESSFUL NY Times is right in a sense. It is the most powerful CABLE MORNING SHOW. Because the JACKASS in the WH retweets it verbatim.
Let's not forget Morning Joe which I sincerely believe he watches and NY Time reporters are regularly on it and many MSNBC programs.
Mr. Pontus Trump I just heard in the next couple months that you're gonna be assassinated it was on Mars TV the next couple months this.
This cannot happen to you we've got to figure out how to protect you in the next couple months I can't believe what I heard
This all comes from Vice President Al Gore Al gore he said that he knew it was going to happen in the next couple months
Sessions  out Urbun should be in to do what we what .... I know you may have heard this but it makes sense
John Mc Cain is bad news for your agenda and focus in the direction of the goals for making America greater    look at his history
Jeff sessions  needs to get off his ass and start prossicuting the criminals who are thinking that the election is over and I lost ...
Somebody wake Jeff Sessions up .... make him do his job
ما ملت جهان از آقای ترامپ انتظار نداریم که برای حقوق بشر و دموکراسی هزینه پرداخت کند چرا که ایشان اعتقادی به دموکراسی ندارند و چون یک تاجر هستند پس ترسو هم هستند. هرگز به خاطر حقوق بشر و به خطر افتادن دموکراسی و گسترش تروریسم و غیره دست به اقدام نظامی @drkarimabdollahi @
Wow, the Failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends "....the most powerful T.V. show in America."...
Distracting from the arrest of George Papadopoulos
Oh well you must not read. NYT in 1851 ESTABLISHED.
Well, you'll never be mistaken for a person with a well developed intellect, that's for sure.
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @guardian

BREAKING! 56% say #Trump “tearing the country apart” @FoxNews #Poll MORE: http://fxn.ws/2vtowCl  
If NYT is failing, why should anyone care what they said? Fake news!
#dividedwefall
5 months to impeachment -mr antichrist
More powerful than the next election? If you last that long @NoWay
I'll never understand how so many Americans buy into your pointless rhetoric. You're an embarrasmnt
bc they are your ear piece ....they just use their power for evil instead of good
So they didn't say that and you couldn't provide a link. Sad tiny baby hands #LiarInChief
It's my favorite sitcom! #foxnews
The only element criminal I'd Nytimes!!
