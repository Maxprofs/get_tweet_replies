beautiful picture tbh

@realDonaldTrump
darth what do we think the odds are that @realDonaldTrump knows who you are on twitter and is as thirsty for your attention as everyone else
.@realDonaldTrump You mean this beautiful picture of you admitting it won't pass because it was terrible? #resist
oh, look...his hair looks like that of a baby easter chick.
Oh look.. a Russian troll with 2 followers. Go away Vlad.
i believed in you 20 years ago and still believe. I No longer worry about who has our back! Thank you for putting US first
@POTUS I agree with you Pam! We have a President who is dedicated to keeping us safe! God Bless him!
He is our hero.Those who are against him WILL eventually see his worth!
.@realDonaldTrump ...oh is it?
...like this picture?
FUUUUUUUUCK YOU. That felt really good, I'm not lying.
And so it did.
So much winning! We are tired of winning already! Your idea of winning SUCKS, Fuhrer! #makeamericaSMARTagain
So much losing. I won't get tired of you losing, that's for sure. 37%..lol #maga

Gotta give you credit on that one big guy. You were right. Spectacular failure was truly a thing of beauty. #KillTheBill
oh it was beautiful, it surely was beautiful!
Sooo...how'd that work out for you?
.@realDonaldTrump do you mean this picture???
LOSER!!! EVERYONE IS LAUGHING AT THE ART OF THE FOLD.
wishing failure on the president makes you no better than the dems...shame
Samantha, surely U see the fascist, dangerous, narcissistic, megalomaniac @realDonaldTrump is? Attacking free press! Lying!
free Press? You mean lying masagonistic press, they attack all republicans well the good ones
Valid press (e.g., NY Times) "attacks" those w/dangerous statements and policies.  UR just not educated, Samantha. Sorry.
no press is valid press
That's the most ignorant thing you've said.  There are journalistic standards. There are facts. Develop a bullshit detector
I am speaking to one, how are you a Republican
Trump demanded and even threatened people over the passage of his Trumpcare project.
What's most to blame for the failure?
Yes. It is a beautiful picture.#theresistance

There are not enough emojis for how great this tweet makes me feel today.
AHAHAHAHAHA. 

You just got wrecked, son.

@chrislhayes Was the death spiral of Trumpcare a beautiful picture?
Stop this kind of tweeting, it just isnt a presidential look. Psssst, there are girls disappearing of the streets in DC
How bout dah? Fix your own backyard. Seems you cant regulate the streets in your own town
Do you really think you can spin anything any way at any time? The American public is smarter than that.

#TrumpcareFail #Obamacarerepeal #AMJoy
You are delusional. The only "beautiful picture" I imagine is you BOGUS POTUS out of office.
@Darinstrauss Friday's outcome was indeed beautiful.  Congrats to all!
Too.Much.Winning!  I'm exhausted.
dude, seriously, I really think you need a zany, or something. You've got major problems in your brain hombre
Just Great is not acceptable. You truly lied to win
You were right. It ended in a beautiful picture.

We get to keep our healthcare coverage.

Now, stay the fuck out of it!
So your tweets about negative coverage of #Trumpcare being fake news was....fake news?
It did end beautifully I agree.
It will end in a beautiful picture? Really, and you wait till it explodes and meanwhile lives are in jeopardy. Horrifying.
lol
We're not stupid but it does make u look stupid when u bold face lie. Forget trumpcare; work on universal HC with D & R.
Is this picture you had in mind? @Potus & @HouseGOP in the weeds! #Trumpcare failed. Not an honest Repub. in sight.
#Resist #TrumpCareFail
Obamacare @POTUS44 defeated Trumpcare because one is good and the other is bad. What a great way to end a beautiful picture

It sure did, Donny. You and your GOP buddies got shut down. You were right. It DOES feel good to win!
You were right! It ended with your failure to get anything done, and that is a beautiful picture!
Yup just like Donnie said he would repeal it the first day in office.  Donnie do you know that you lie.
your friends don't want to have bad blood with the #kochbrothers - who we all know, are more powerful than you.

How is that healthcare coming along?
President Trump, a lot of us are supporting you and believe in what you are trying to do. I am a device connected Vietnam Veteran and a lot of Veterans are supporting you. Keep up the good work, and help me get Service connected on my knee, I have tried for many years.
Taking away WIC & medical care for millions of people isn't beautiful.  As ugly as the devil himself.
Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a...
You are a liar.
