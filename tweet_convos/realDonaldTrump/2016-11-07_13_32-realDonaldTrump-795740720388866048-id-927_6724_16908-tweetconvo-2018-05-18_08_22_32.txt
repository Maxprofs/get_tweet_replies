President Trump was chosen by the American people to be our President. He towers over all the rest here and abroad. Yay!
the CBO should also score Obamacare if no change, including no changes made. How many lose coverage & what are premiums
Call their bluff, have the vote. No way the Freedom Caucus all vote No and explain next years Obamacare increases at home
Honest Politicians are an endangered species. When you find one, you keep him, at all cost!
Superb, creative leader as he has been in business; Federal Gov't is the biggest business in the world.
Because we hated Hillary and her little bitty supporters who decided not to vote
HAHAHHAHAHH no
Trump is ugly inside and out.  Whatever good he might do is not worth the risk to democracy
because no man in history has ever fight for our country like Trump has!!
because he's a leader not a follower!!
Satan Allah fucked up
maybe the AG job is now too much for 1 person. How about 2 AGs one for domestic one for international  or something  w/ 2
Uber exec quit your council, what an ASS! Replace him with Taxi Union person.
because he is so stupid, has no political background, and used racism to rise as power
because no man has ever gave up so much for what he believes in!!
i been asking the same shit
Hillary supporters will be crying so many tears, it's going to raise sea levels. #MAGA
You were right! They were crying buckets of tears!
because no man in history has been brave enough been brave enough to stand to our corrupt government!!
Good question!
