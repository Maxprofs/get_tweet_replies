.@joshrogin Bush himself called it a "framework for withdrawal of American forces" in the infamous shoe presser https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html …
Here, read this:
@ForeignPolicy you're quoting an article by someone trying to sell a book and shine a better light on it? Seems legit.
I wrote that article.
haha, even better.
But troops still there without, no?
@realDonaldTrump the bush admin didn't even know they were installing a pro Iranian Shia regime. You live in Trump fantasy land..
given Obama desire to fulfill mission accomplished by pulling all troops out,did not negotiate in good faith
@realDonaldTrump oh it wasn't enough Obama had to dig us out of his lousy economy he has to redo his agreements also? GOP = Loser
@realDonaldTrump
Explain. I've never seen evidence Bush "anticipated" an Iraq troop extention or had a plan to negotiate one. He set timetable.
because Trump supporters/right wing don't live by factual reality, making stuff up is what they do #zerofacts
They wanted it to fail, that was their 'get out jail free' card...    #flimflammed
@realDonaldTrump josh, your simply lying and Bush stated he was not. FYI bush does not support Trump. Nice try though.
@realDonaldTrump if a country doesn't want us within its borders then they have every right to ask us to leave.
@realDonaldTrump do you mean they tried or did not even try as Obama wanted to withdraw the troops immediately.
@Trump_World pence was right about everything that's why blabber mouth ass clown kept interrupting ! And Pence laid a slap down
@realDonaldTrump oh my gosh the show that aired on showtime told it all
negotiation is a two way street. Iraq refused. You knew that.
@nopenochange After saving their country, putting oil money in their pockets, to let them dictate terms to USA is insane weakness
so we should have just invaded them again and replaced the government we had just installed?  Good one!
@realDonaldTrump Sorry Josh boy...the failure there was Bush's. His and Cheney's policies created so much hate it was over.
our troops don't know their mission because the President doesn't. I think they would turn on him in a New York minute.
@JamesABaade no we and the world lost
@realDonaldTrump.fine put your ass in fatigues along with your kids and we'll air drop you in. NO reason for boots on the ground
expectations in bush White House, in pentagon, was continues US military presence in Iraq,partly to offset Iran
they failed because this WH has yet to build concencus on anything (unless they brow beat like w/Obamacare or pay off like Iran)
really didn't fail; didn't have the political wherewithal to make a deal happen... ran on ending war!  Sad 4000 lives wasted!
Kaine a grotesque liar, why doesnt he talk about Hillary murdering Gaddafi for profit?
You have been misled.by liars.
@realDonaldTrump you are a draft dodger. Others gave their lives while you stayed home discriminating against blacks
Trump doesn't discriminate against blacks you dumb fuck.
Ignore this sewerbilge Andrew. HRC is the Bigot, agnst mdle class America! #ELITIST
Nobody will realize that Dems are the biggest racists of them all for some reason.
because Iraq would not give troop protection.. THEY DIDN'T WANT US THERE!!!!
@realDonaldTrump No hate. Just pointing out that hind sight is 20/20 and Iraq was yet another mess Bush left to be cleaned up.
@kdubrn They said they pulled out due to no agreement BUT now we have 6000 troops there,maybe more & we STILL HAVE NO AGREEMENT.
Complete incompetence. Time for some adults to take over.
@realDonaldTrump Bush started the whole bloody fiasco 
some of the hater responses you get sound like people who were dropped on their heads one to many times as a baby or druggies?
@realDonaldTrump
Sure they did.
@realDonaldTrump Actually Bush didn't have a clue.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe, but that Bush administration that you speak of is NOT supporting Trump.
More than that: Obama didn't WANT to stay in Iraq for political reasons - and to make W look bad.
They failed for the same reason Bush/Cheney FAILED...Clinton & Obama fail because of  Bush/Cheney
oh good, let's rehash this. meanwhile, who fixes the roads and schools over here? not dopey don
the Bush's  showed their self as anti-americans
so how troops are there now
@realDonaldTrump -  There is no such agreement to cover the groups in Iraq at present.  COULPE OF
Troop ext neg. were window-dressing, Obama didn't want it, neither did Iran. Iran rolled over him, again. #JustLying
@mike_pence -right about all except name of the debate venue. I'm sure he's being insulted for that tiny slip #desperate liberals
Clinton and Obama didn't try because they wanted to use the SOFA as a reason to pull out the troops, which was always their goal.
Obama and Hill failed in negotiations because they didn't want a deal. Pulling out at all costs. Catastrophic.
We could have kept the troops there without an extension but I believe Obama didn't want the it. He wanted the Troops Out.
@realDonaldTrump then why didn't shrub take care of it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tErgLS5m_BU&sns=tw … via @youtube
@AziaeLion every time we're in  war we leave BASE for stability purposes that's what should've have happened to help Iraqi PPL
Well documented that Obama/HC did everything but try!
@narnie4
I'm Sorry @HillaryClinton , I screwed up! Please don't 302 me? 
#hesnotwithme #strongerapart 
@Vet4Trump2016 
Isn't it a bit absurd when a democrat calls someone a draft dodger ?
I mean really is there no end ...
BO & HC inept, just say "Ok, troops, military equip, ordinance, etc. all going leaving you on your own & halting foreign aid."
@realDonaldTrump @JoeNBC @SenWarren Trying to rewrite history doesn't make it so. Failed regressive strategies caused Iraq.
@Veteran4Trump GET THIS OUT Obamas plan to take American out from 1991
W/ ALL the US Blood & Treasure Sacrificed - You Ask Once 4 SOF-Agree...Then DEMAND It
@realDonaldTrump so Clinton and Obama were wrong for taking our troops out and they are also bad for trying to keep them in?
@benshapiro They tried like a Kaine tried to let Pence speak last night.
@Veteran4Trump  Under Democrat watch..... http://mobile.wnd.com/2016/10/200-veterans-die-waiting-for-care/ …. Not acceptable. Trump will fix it!
read it and weep http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44998833/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/iraq-pm-immunity-issue-scuttled-us-troop-deal/#.V_T4tY8rLIU …
And Trump wanted all the troops out immediately. http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/trump-isis-obama-clinton-iraq-withdraw-2006-interview …
Obama did want an Iraq troop extension He wanted the vacuum. He let ISIS grow. Obama practices Taqiyya on America every day
You mean another triumph of Hillary's record? Failure means best presidential candidate ever? Enough lowering the bar please.
ask yourself this too while they're making excuses as usual: do we have one in place now?
They certainly failed. Over and over.
They didn't try very hard, Negotiators had no flexibility bcz O wanted to leave.
@cmrose999 Bring all Our Troops Home and enforce Vetting of refugees. Let the Arab League die for their own people not Us..
@realDonaldTrump Complete BS
pence was 110% correct on that issue
@realDonaldTrump I guess you didn't know that Iraq wanted to prosecute our guys  right? Immunity for our guys and they said no
@DanScavino
O/Clinton half heartedly negotiated a forces agreement
@realDonaldTrump let's not let the facts get in your way.
ok
Of course they did, that is obviously why they set a withdrawal date... SARCASIM!!!
the Iraqis also wanted us to stay. The media made it out as if we had overstayed. We had not and did not.
@realDonaldTrump 
Obama and Killary pulled the troops because of no agreement, but we still have troops deployed.
They initiated that withdrawal. If they were expecting an "extension," they weren't withdrawing from anything. #HaveOrEatTheCake
The "failure" to negotiate an extension conveniently provided political cover to withdraw, satisfying a campaign pledge as well.
LIE!
@realDonaldTrump But left it undone?  Odd and short sighted
Obama has sent over 5,000 troops back into Iraq. SOF agreement signed prior to them being sent back, or were they just sent in?
There was no ISIS and probably no Arab Spring if we hadnt gone to Iraq. Trump would not have gone there
Bush also said he didnt believe in nation building. Shouldnt have gone to Iraq in the first place.
@hughhewitt The Iraqis didn't want us there after Bush helped screw up things so badly.
BS! There's no way in hell Maliki, who took his marching orders from IRAN, would have agreed to "such an extension"!
@realDonaldTrump it's a terrible shame that the Democrats are committed to allow illegals to enter USA for votes. Safety VS Votes
@realDonaldTrump at the time, Obama wanted the vote from the anti war groupies and he is Islamic, so he committed to reduce & did
.@joshrogin @realDonaldTrump Analyst is an overused term these days. I remember a time when actual analysis was part of the JD of an analyst
The elephant in obama's sophistry room is the fact that he's slow rolled us back up to 6000 troops in Iraq w/o SoFA!
Romney hammered Obama on failing to establish a SOFA, it went nowhere. Sadly.
@benshapiro then why do we still have 6,000 troops there?
@benshapiro so #Bush makes wrong calculations &plans then @HillaryClinton &@BarackObama get blamed for it?That is lame&infantile
@realDonaldTrump An interesting denial of the reality on the ground.
@hughhewitt
NOT how Jeb Bush explained it
He would know the facts
Bush could've done SofF but politely left it ready for Obama
it takes both sides to negotiate. Iraq wanted troops out. Can't negotiate with that @hughhewitt
If up to them there would've been a force. Failed bc Iraq flatly refused to provide our troops immunity and did not want us there
@nopenochange Reason Obama. /Clinton failed to get troop extension in Iraq is their both kiss ass morons, should of demanded it
grammar isn't your strong suit @joshrogin @nopenochange
Fuck Off , how's that for grammar you toad?
Well, sorta. It's more accurate to say they pushed a lesser issue as a larger one so that a SOFA was "non-re-negotiable".
Bullsh*t  Is was Bush's job and he failed. Iraq refused to come back to the table because of Bush
@hughhewitt his mistake was anticipating competence by those who followed.
@hughhewitt lol "anticipated"!
. If you had a child in the war would you want them to stay without a safety net. We don't.
AND "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE"? WE HAVE 15K TROOPS IN IRAQ AND STILL NO SOF AGREEMENT.
Yes Sir indeed...Killary can not run on the facts that's why she avoided the press until now
they don't just twist the truth...they outright lie
@realDonaldTrump More Bush deception...
@realDonaldTrump Donald for President
@realDonaldTrump "anticipated" is HILARIOUS!  Kudos!
So the bottom line is: Obama / Clinton were incapable of negotiating an agreement because they stunk at it.
@realDonaldTrump  Obama wants to take credit for troop pullout but not own results
BHO and HRC blew the status of forces! Stink at negotiations, or on purpose??? #FollowTheMoney
You are absolutely correct!
Clinton & Obama don't know how to win.  They only have a legacy of corruption, death, treason and failure.
no you are wrong.
@pkfanderson #Obama #Hillary did not want to succeed in keeping troops in place. Plain & simple #EpicFail #tcot
@realDonaldTrump no Bush had a deal that we would get out
Yeap. I remember it well
@realDonaldTrump Nice job by Bush. He can't do it so Blame the next president.
@realDonaldTrump Bush also paved the way for Bin Ladens extermination too, but Obama and Clinton take all the credit.
@realDonaldTrump You are incorrect. They let the Iraqis vote on whether the US should stay and then upheld the Iraqi decision.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong. But you can believe what you will.
KAINE WAS RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS INTERRUPTING MIKE PENCE! PENCE WAS SUPERB! CROOKED HILLARY!
@realDonaldTrump what does that even mean? BUSH negotiated an agreement that ended us troop involvement in Iraq on a set date.
Bush admin told us from the beginning we'd be welcomed as liberators. I saw the Mission Accomplished sign too. Plus no WMD's so..
Didn't think #obama even tried to negotiate..he had 1 goal & that was to end the war- no matter what. HE/#HILLARY PAVED WAY4 isis
@realDonaldTrump hard to negotiate for something when you do not want to win
@realDonaldTrump Can we say Blackwater???  How quickly ppl forget Cheney's private army!
@realDonaldTrump But, But, But, that's a good excuse for failure. Did we get their permission to go there?
@realDonaldTrump President Bush started these negotiations  and Iraq did not want the US to remain.  I think Iraq has that right.
THEY never wanted a status of troops agreement. A monkey could have gotten one.
@DiCristo13 Obama wanted to pull out, so he put Biden on the job, knowing he'd fail as planned.
Dems controlled House and Senate during that time.
the government to guarantee the troops safety and immunity.  Trump would not have been succcessful either SFTU
@realDonaldTrump Iraq refused to renegotiate SOFA which would have placed U.S. troops under Iraqi law Obama withdrew our troops!
They didn't try hard enough.
@realDonaldTrump yeah, that war was going so well for us!
Yes, IRAQ  wanted 15,000 troops to STAY! Obama said no!
@realDonaldTrump Anticipation does not equal a guarantee. No one was ever promised an extension.
I anticipate winning powerball, doesn't mean I have. Al Maliki was in the way from the start. And the sovereign nation thing
@realDonaldTrump are you still alive fool or dead if you're not dead then they knew what the hell they were doing!
@realDonaldTrump wrong
@ Kaine is the most arrogant person I've ever seen and a liar and best
@realDonaldTrump exactly
Obama ALWAYS intended to remove ALL troops from Iraq! He used the 'inability' to reach a SOF agreement as the excuse to get out!
Bush is directly responsible for the creation of ISIS. Good job #GOP @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump OF COURSE PENCE IS RIGHT.
@realDonaldTrump: Nonsense! The @GOP smears or, to put it bluntly, LIES continue!
@realDonaldTrump they didn't try to negotiate. Obama was more than happy to leave Iraq as soon as he could
for God's sake no Obama and Clinton did not try to negotiate. Cut the bull shit
@realDonaldTrump yeah. The Iraq government refused. End of story.
@realDonaldTrump Yep but HRC fails to mention that!  Very sad and what a terrible job she did!  -Single Mom
@realDonaldTrump Of course Bush admin anticipated it, they started the war on lies and deceit. They wanted it.
They didn't really try. Obama campaigned on full removal of our troops. Romney labeled it a tragedy in first debate.
@realDonaldTrump Yet, Bush approved the withdrawal because Iraq wanted us out!
Iraq kicked us out.  Threw a shoe at Bush.
exactly right
Yep! Clinton & Obama dropped the ball & created ISIS.
@realDonaldTrump anticipated. Why didn't he negotiated that ahead of leaving?
1 point for Pence, 200 points for Kaine! LOL
@realDonaldTrump who was President when planes flew into the towers Josh? You know. What started the war
@realDonaldTrump @joshrogin #KaineVsPence kaine looks like a angry evil #Clown #Joker from #Batman #TrumpPence16 #NeverHillary
if he anticipated extension why didn't he negotiate that the first time? Sounds like bull to me. @realDonaldTrump
get the occupiers out, always
