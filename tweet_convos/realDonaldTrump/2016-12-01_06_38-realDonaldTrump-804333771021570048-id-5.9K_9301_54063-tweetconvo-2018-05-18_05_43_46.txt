.@realDonaldTrump This Guy #smh
Thank you Mr Prez. for putting Americans First!  Can't wait to see what you'll do for the American worker after Jan. 20th.
good luck with that 
Don't work at Carrier but bless you for remembering the 'real' workers of our great state/nation! Could have been any of us
If Carrier peeps are all that wonderful then why are they not keeping ALL the jobs in Indiana?
How much did it cost the American tax payers to keep those jobs here?
Unfair!
one of the forgotten who has left several messages and emails without  reply guess the forgotten are still left forgotten
Deal with illegal immigration first,then Obamacare!!!
you dont care that 1,000 people still have jobs? I hope you never lose your job or maybe you dont even have one
Incredible! That's what you are....absolutely incredible!

Go Trump !!! and please do drain the swamp !!! No Neo-Cons Please !!
.@realDonaldTrump Can you give us more inconsequential detail about your daily life? What color are your shoes?  Have plenty of TicTacs?
.@realDonaldTrump
Lock him up!
they'll take the $700K and move the jobs in a year. No tweets from Don when that happens though. #TrumpShellGames
you remove all the adjectives in Trump's tweets and what remains is emptier than space
Jesuit Jew #GeorgeSoros owns #CrookedHillary more than #SaudiBarbiera - by #Clintons choosing
Correction  #SaudiBabaria
you saved 1000 jobs lost thousands more used IN tax $750,000. Hoosiers will have to pay this. Tell me again how this helped
So glad my husband and I voted for you.  We were with you from the start.  Great job already! 
good
President, YOU AGAINST SATAN WORSHIPERS. PRAY. BRING OUT PIZZAGATE, EXPOSE THEIR CRIMES AGAINST AMERICAN CHILDREN TO SATAN.
stop with the shameless plugs. Just do the job right and stop asking for praise.
Do they know you gave the company everything it wanted and screwed the Tax payers?  You take a pay-cut!
Last line is the kicker
Timeline of key events leading to @realDonaldTrump’s deal to keep #Carrier jobs http://apne.ws/2gCZllI  #TRUMP
way to go! You rock
1,300 jobs at Carrier are still going to Mexico. How about every other business in America? They'll want the same gift.
He's got excellent business sense. Why don't you evaluate after four years?
No, he isn't. 6 bankruptcies & many failed businesses precedes him. He's a con and a loser. Fastest impeached
He's a man of his word. Feels like a dark cloud is being lifted off of America.
Trump is a pathological liar. Most of what he says isn't true. You are too simple to see this evident truth.
@Reardon28 thank you DJT for being the man you are. Honored @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls #13hours #letemcome
thank you sir for the man YOU are.....A SOLDIER
Uh how about this: Bernie Sanders: Carrier just showed corporations how to beat Donald Trump
you people are such fools Bernies a  liar anyway

http://cvedc.org/vt-economic-growth-incentives-vegi …
Carrier moving 1100 rather than 2100 jobs 2 Mexico because Trump gives em a tax break is somehow patriotic? Ha!
HILLARY FOR PRISON
he already took back that promise.  No more #LockHerUp ... Sorry bout that
he's just trying to make you pussies happy until January 20th. Say bye!!
really?You buy that?He promised those things and now you just are grasping at straws.Sorry you feel duped
duped?  I'm just glad it's not Hillary. HA
you don't care that he sold you one thing and it turned out it's not true?Wow, let me sell you a used car
you act like Hillary was the most transparent candidate of all time. Wait til January 20th. It'll happen.
I never defended her. He has said clearly he won't do it. Prove otherwise. I'll tweet you back on the 21st
you stole the election from hillary

not when she is ahead by 2.4M in the popular vote!

thought you said those employees were no good all they did was talk instead of work which is it you cant have it both ways
lol 
Totally staged con. Def Con UT to benefit billions. Trumpsters soak this crap up. Tax payers to foot YOUR bill. #notmyprez
Whatever Obama did ain't workin'.
Stop drinking your bong water.  U R high.  Obama has created millions of jobs. #notmyprez #DumpTrump
so many people unemployed.
A lot fewer unemployed than in 2008.  Look at numbers
the numbers don't include those who have lost benefits, aren't eligible for benefits, or just gave up looking
Those numbers down too http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm …
MY job Joy mining/Damascus Metals/Wolf Hills Fab., Abingdon, VA. EVERONE SUPPORTS YOU AND DEPEND ON U. Thanks Mr President!
How much money did you make off the deal?
What loser follows someone they hate?
What loser tweets someone they don't know to harass them
To pay them to send the jobs to Mexico on schedule as planeed, keeping the white collars -same thanks for NOTHING
Take me with you
stock up in the ego supply ... it is what narcissists do. It is your drug.
MR. T right side broadcasting shows the crowds at. Rallies.
More layoffs planned at Carrier plant Trump promised to save http://fxn.ws/2zv4eJd  #FoxNews
stay humble and strong.  At 92 I am still hopeful.

Sir, may I recommend Doctor Ben Carson for Director of VA.
So why is the position for managing the VA one of the last to be announced ? It seems again that our promise is not fulfilled, shame on us.
You did it Donald Trump!  Not even sworn in yet and already saving our jobs!
They aren't paying a dime.
Is that what ur junk news sites are telling you? Carrier is effing Trump and IN taxpayers
Tax break isn't the same as a bailout. They didn't pay a penny for Carrier.
Decreases in corporate taxes harms the people of IN.  They get screwed.
The benefits of keeping 1,000+ in the workforce offset that.
2 mons ago Trump pledged they would pay taxes. He caved now it's a reward for outsourcing
Yeah they took more of our tax dollars and RAN
Please visit the burnt Smokies. They all voted for you.They could use some uplifting words love and compassion right now.
@trumpbigregrets @realDonaldTrump He does not care about you. Get used to it. Hillary would have been there. #hillarywon
Right after her drinks drugs and child sex
lol. #delusional
billions from govt contracts and you need to give them more? What kind of negotiator are you? Pisspoor
They're sending most of their jobs overseas, just like you.  We KNOW the truth.
: Just love you & laugh with U all of the time! Whatever U do or say is 'Presidential'! U R president-period!
what of Their jobs still going to Mexico despite your your incentives? Such carelessness with our money. Negotiating fail!!
Mr President please consider Mr Gate Sinise for Director of Veterans Affairs!
WE THE PEOPLE NOW WILL B PAYING 4 the 6 MILLION u gave Carrier in tax breaks to stay. U sick lunatic!!!!
ver cómo funciona actual de alrededor
thank you for doing this. this is the type of leadership this country has been lacking for the last 8 years
You mean your rich CEO friends who get the taxpayer's money

CNN= the face of Agony and defeat in reporting, FOX= the face of Honesty and hope in reporting

Spend more time learning to be Pres.and less time looking for adulation. Your unproven and unprofessional.
Thank you Thrump/Pence Team for jobs save Indiana

YOU are doing an amazing job and it's only just begun! #Amazing #TRUMP #TrumpPence16 ##
Indiana hates you!!
so much for what you said about that when running. Now you promise them IND taxes & Lord knows what else &still moving jobs
Still waiting for YOU (not your son) to come to Indian Country!
The taxpayers were kicking you out as they cried about using infrastructure money to pay RICH Carrier to keep 700 jobs.
Carrier Corporation will move only 1,300 jobs to Mexico, not 2,100 as planned. LOSER DEAL
Who Cares You Are A Racist!
sir you are amazing making friends with Pakistan PM is deplorable
We required immediate investigation on blk mental illeness  diagnosis n system  Blk are abusily label mental so medicated
Thank God for Change
i cant wait for you to be president.
I sincerely hope this could be applied to all companies who outsource jobs outside the USA.
.@realDonaldTrump UTX CEO gets $172M package. UTX has $6 BILLION defense contract. Half of jobs STILL go to MEXICO & U give corp tax breaks?
CARRIER FIASCO - Deals like this is why Trump lost a BILLION DOLLARS in one year!!  

http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/12/06/carrier-workers-union-trump-lied-ass-off-saving-factory-jobs/ …
1,000 jobs cost the taxpayer $7 million. Bad Deal!
Remember this? Who's stupid now, Donald?

Wall Street Journal says it was a shakedown http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-carrier-shakedown-1480639199 …
watched your thank you tour rally tonight such a wonderful time for our country thank you 
Apoye a los #venezolanos  por favor !
Bullshit 800. Jobs goi-g to mexico. Maybe they can buy ties from your factory
: Oops, he is interfering in the free market. Should be killed by Republicans.
Mr.President-elect it wud be less embarrassing for ur American brethren if u took a crash course in Spoken&Written English
Necer mind falsehoods,exaggerations or turnabout - Nawaz Sharif is a great guy, good reputation .Pak is a fantastic country
Write it right , Write it tight !
your work with carrier is awesome. You have accomplished more in 2 months than Obama did in 8 years! Thankyou
and the Carrier employees how Trump made a deal to get only half of them fired nice half-ass jog here's your toilet
You gave IN tax money to a company that sent jobs to Mexico! You Are the worst negotiator!
http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/28/under-pence-state-gave-incentives-companies-offshored-jobs/89260966/ …

don't save the jobs just so they can keep paying taxes. Make sure Carrier pays a fair share of them too
dictators always start by promising the world, siding w/Russia,filling cabinet w/generals and demonizing a group
did you meet with the carrier people who did lose their jobs

Great speech. Thank you sir. God Bless you.
great job
you saved 1000  jobs? Go for those headlines..not what is best for US..let them move to Mexico and tax the hell out F them
travel safe and great job with Carrier Corp. Shows you care and are a man of your word.  Also had to laugh at Tom Ford Haha
what your doing looks a lot like how the mob operates!
Steal credit for Pence's deal. Blame "Meredith McIver" for your fuckups. #Loser

#NotMyPresident lost the popular vote now by 2.5 million. Chickenshit Rump Trying to block recounts in PA, MI and WI. Smells @cspanwj
saved 1,000 jobs for $7,000,000 AND they are still sending jobs to Mexico... My dog could have made a better deal than that
too bad 1000 will lose their jobs and the company got a huge tax break 
I thought you were going charge them to import product from Mexico but instead you gave them a bunch of cash and no tax
Why not visit Flint instead? It's nice to go where your ass will be kissed, but how about you hit yourself w/ some reality?
my hometown! My brother does a lot of customized concrete work for them.....
Enjoyed watching U at Carrier today.EveryDem wants to poo poo the success U had.They are all jealous and kicking themselves
Subsidizing 800 jobs in Indiana for $7M USD is no way to grow the economy chump. You need to create 4M jobs, do the math !
You've been fooled. You've opened the door for any US company to demand tax breaks. Good job, genius!
Congratulations! Thank you for the Ford & Carrier deals. Actions speak louder than Words! MAGA a gov. for & by the people
CON MAN!!!
what about the hard working people who worked for your companies ? that you screwed ...

Carrier deal in a nutshell:
- Jobs saved from going to Mexico: 800
- Jobs still going to Mexico: 1,300
- Cost to Indiana taxpayers: $7M

in this political World you Sir are a breath of fresh air. May I recommend the Fair Tax! Limits the IRS tyranny.
1300 jobs still going to Mexico.Additionally,this is a slippery slope giving an incentive to not ship jobs overseas.
and you will stroke you're Ego! You are a disgrace and opened the hatred in the USA. Not my POTUS,
Loved it . Bravo President Trump!!!

Really? Your going to meet with the actual workers, before you closet yourself with their money-grubbing employers? Wow!
Good job Donald!! You conned 'em again. #lyingtrump
and lie to them!
did a 1.000 or so employees get lay off notices?
Where's your tax returns.
why don't you just shut up.its clear you don't know what you are doing!!
love it ! They truly thank u for caring and so do we!
Have lived S Korea 2006-11 never saw a foreign car. There exists collusion industry-gov there. Help American PhD engineers!
what about our jobs in Huntington, Indiana they matter also. We supply Indy with the circuit boards to make the furnaces.
@mike_pence The Great White Negotiator! Carrier deal cost Indiana 7 million and jobs still left! Way to go! #NotMyPresident
hard working. Something you know nothing about
the 1/2 that will keep their jobs with incentives paid by Indiana taxpayers. Lie and deny.
congratulations on only losing 1,100 Carrier jobs to Mexico. Welcome to crony capitalism. Hugo Chavez would be proud.
Backing will not hi be stop black,Donald! Eva de respect unempmloy. Effort Special Miyuki.
Trumpets #donthecon conned you BIGLY
SO....when are you bringing your manufacturing BACK?  Or are you going to tax yourself on every tie? Hypocrisy much?
Hmm, you forgot to disclose that you were a shareholder...So you just took the good people of Indiana's $. #corrupt
@TeamTrump Buy @Carrier to show American companies we will reward their loyalty. @realDonaldTrump has given the silent majority a voice!
Listening to your speech. Meanwhile legislation is underway to put small US cigar makers out of business. #handrolledcigars
you are doing great. Optimism is finally back. Merry Christmas.
