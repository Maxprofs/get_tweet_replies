1. Today Pres. Trump Tweeted about:  "an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information." Trump McGahn Pence & Flynn all thought firing @SallyQYates 3 days after she exposed #Flynn would to put an end to the issue of lying to @FBI.  18 days later it leaked.
2. Why did Trump & his crew think it would remain secret? Because it was discovered in #FISA intercept. SCI code worded & Yates could never tell anyone. So day after Yates told them they rolled out the totally unconstitutional travel ban.  3 days later Trump fired Yates.

ALSO WORTH NOTING: Both Trump and Netanyahu are embroiled in dire, administration threatening scandals. Both have terrible approval ratings, Netanyahu at 38% and Trump at 39%.…

FOR THE RECORD: Nuclear arms inspectors have certified that Iran is compliant with the nuclear deal, and even the Israeli presentation acknowledged evidence that Iran had halted its nuclear program years…

Yesterday, Trump claimed that pulling out of the Iran deal would “send the right message to North Korea.”

The message: don’t trust the United States, our word…

Thank you President Trum who can't be bought like all the others.
Thank you for your tireless work on fixing our trade deficit @realDonaldTrump, that has decimated our economy for years. You are one of the only politicians I've ever heard publicly address that issue and is a big reason why I supported you before you even announced your run.
Here is my Facebook post I made 7 years ago on this topic, in April 2011.

Thank you for doing the right thing on the trade deficit for US @realDonaldTrump!

Here is that video link from January 2011:
Day #465 of the hostage situation. Evil Captor sill capitalizing random nonsensical words like Massive Trade Deficit Minions too Afraid To Correct Him. @jamesalandarby
我不觉得你们美国就有多强大，多了不起，制造混乱的就是你们，世界哪儿都有你们制造的灾难，你们没有多么伟大，只是一群自以为是的家伙。很多人活着多么不容易。关于中东，关于朝鲜，你们没有资格，中国你们更没有资格以这种方式来讨论。我不得你有多了不起，简直就是小丑
自始至终，美国与他的西方爪牙，都是制造混乱给别人并从混乱与灾难中博取利益。这种方式会持续，直到有一天美国真正从第一的宝座跌落。
Mr President, under your leadership t people of this nation know for absolute certainty that it will all get done & done correctly this time around, contrary t oppositional views. Show t all Mr President how true & strong leadership is t be conducted. Especially against all odds.
Didn't Republicans pitch a fit at the very idea of speaking with Korea before? So sit down.
Yeah, we saw the delegation. Four ugly old white guys. That's not America. I'll be so glad when you're gone. It ain't 1950, dude, as much as you'd like it to be. You are a Dotard. You're too old to be president. You live in another century. Ugh.
All kidding aside, I believe in term limits and age limits. If you can't be president until you are 35, you should not be able to be president after the age of 70.
I have to agree. There comes a point when certain things are best left to the middle aged.
Or the young!!
I consider 30 and under young. 30 to 60 middle aged. 60 and above senior. While I think younger people have great ideas, I wouldn't want anyone under 35 as president. There needs to be experience, too.
I agree totally with the 35 or okder for president for the same reason, but I am troubled by 80 yr olds who have been in office for 30 + years. Being a politician should not be a lifetime career. They lose touch, they become insulated, and they become beholden.

JUST IN: Trump's former doctor says Trump bodyguard, lawyer "raided" his office, took medical files,  @NBCNews reports in an exclusive.…
The doc probably prescribed opiods for Trump. Jackson aka Candy Man probably passed out all kinds of drugs to Trump. Trump figures that Candy Man is being investigated for prescription drugs.Trump has probably sanitized his WH medical records, too.
Trade deficits don't matter.

Hmm so yr going 2 have trade war w/ China? You've backed off of steel w/Mexico, Canada & Europe.The BIG question is why U never even said tarrif would apply to RussiaWhy? Since yr tweets started @ 4 rather than 5 I'm assuming you did not sleep very well Awww
Trump,
Stop pretending that you know anything about international trade!
You’ve only made things worse you FAILURE!
He is an expert on international bankruptcy
Nah!
Even that he needs explained to him. Trump is stupid!


You're an international disgrace. A horrible human being and corrupt and dumb as a rock. Most of us already knew it.. some had to be around you for a period of time to figure out what we already knew..
And they should know it.

It will be interesting to see how you fuck this up, too. You have great potential for that.
Zzzzz your economic lies are the most pathetic. Gas & goods prices are up. Wages were not raised from your @GOP TaxScam 1% stimulus. Pharmaceutical prices skyrocketing. Middle class & working poor are struggling & heading into tax increases next year.

Like you fixed all your failed businesses years ago?

In celebration of peace between North and South Korea....How can anyone question @POTUS and his ability to lead our country! Thank you so much Mr. President!

代表团前往中国，开始就对我国的巨大贸易逆差进行商谈。和北韩问题很像，这本来早就该解决的而不是放了这么多年，直到现在。和其他国家以及北美自由贸易协定一样...不过这些逆差现在都会纠正过来。看好米国！
逆差无法商谈，还给你们1000亿逆差？做梦！人民辛辛苦苦，你们说减少逆差就逆差吗？真是可笑。政府欠下中国这么多钱，那还能算了吗？

PLZ go on live TV & without prompting or assistance, point out every country that is involved in NAFTA. U can't do it! I have asked U over & over 2 simply point out the capital of every state in UR own country & U cant. If U don't know who U represent why should we even listen?
Point out ? He should fucking spell them....
Of course not. He should just at least know how to find them on a map. Do you honestly think that's too much to ask from the "president" of the United States of America?
I mean honestly, I hang my head in shame every single time I hear something that has come out of his "pie hole". Or should I say "Big Mac" hole? LOL!
We are so embarrassed for the many, many, good people there.
预祝谈判大胜！另外，能否请您提议让中国早点开放互联网，以让我们更方便看到总统的精彩发言！I wish the negotiation victory! In addition, can you please propose to let China open the Internet as soon as possible so that we can more easily see the President's twitter!

The "239 lb" baby is whining again. Sad.
Yes Mr. Mueller, I'll answer your questions and I don't even want any special treatment. I just want the treatment Hillary Clinton got; no tape recorders, no notes, no sworn testimony, no oaths, no tough questions and make sure the exoneration report is already written in advance

I'm beginning to think all your bitching and blame throwing has less to do with what you think is good for the USA and more to do with you're pissed that they didn't "fix" this so you wouldn't have to give up precious golf time to work. 
Explain the effect of these deficits on our currency? Foreign investment? Under what circumstances are deficits beneficial? And what potential negative consequences can occur by eliminating trade deficits with China? If you don’t understand this, stop tweeting nonsense!
Ummm.  Aren’t you the one who caused the problem with trade with China?  I recall recent tariffs on things like steel...  Did you conveniently forget that?  It’s great if you can fix what you broke though Spanky!
that's right
Don't you mean great potential for $ for you & your family?? #MuellerIsComingForYou
Mr President. You have opened doors that your predecessors feared to go near let alone open. We are once again respected. Thank you.

The trade balance issues with unfair trade practices and forced tech transfer to access Chinese markets should have been in previous administrations. Only Trump has the guts and resolution to solve it now, he will deliver the greatest Presidency in the most recent US history.
Are you going to tweet it away or golf it away?
This is great. Can we do something about the gas prices?? Geez I need a second job to pay for the stuff.

Still making those crappy ties in China ?
Trump, how much money does America owe China? You’ve been borrowing due to the tax cuts. Had to get money somewhere didn’t you? Not tosmart to let the 1% get away without paying taxes & now we have to borrow to cover it. Bad decision

Do you really think that they will be so excepting of you after you imposed the tariffs? You are gambling with the lives of REAL American workers who now will have increased costs of products to/from China or even worse won't be able to make a profit because of these tariffs.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Should’ve would’ve could’ve it’s on you now Spanky. Let’s see what happens.
Do you even know what a trade deficit is?

We buy more goods they make (like your stupid mags hats) than they buy from us.
The causes however, are myriad and beyond your comprehension.
@GOP I will be surprised if America does not collapse before Trump finish's 1 Term,Republicans know what they did and allowed him to do will collapse America,Between the massive payouts and knowing America will collapse, Cut and run and blame democrat's for it,Like they always do
The National Deficit is real and it’s bigger this year. Still waiting on the great deals that will change National deficits into surplus and decrease the National debt. You have increase spending while simultaneously cutting taxes. The math doesn’t add up correctly.
