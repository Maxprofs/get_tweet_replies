In the face of tragedy, we pull together, support each other, and thank the extraordinary first responders who keep us safe. #TorontoStrong 
I didn’t vote for Trump because he was a morally perfect person. I voted for him because he has the BALLS to do what is RIGHT for this country!

I believe God has placed this imperfect man in the perfect position to save us from ourselves. May the Lord continue to bless the USA.

But what about the Waffle House shooting?!? (And the hero who stopped it!!??)
Canada first?
well it is for Canadians
I completely agree with the statement (and it should be made) but for a guy whose slogan is “America first...”
well, we are neighbours
Again I have nothing against the actual statement and completely agree with it. The point I am making is he hasn’t commented about this shooting at all (and it even happened a while before the Canadian event).
Because the shooter was not an immigrant or a person of color.
Amen. I wonder why they are being so tight lipped about victims and the man who did it. It all seemed to fade fast from the news.
Have the liberals started talking about banning vans and all automatic vehicles yet?
The poor people of Toronto, which is a beautiful city, should not have had to go through such a horrible tragedy. I really hope they actually released the details of the story as they really seem to be burying it at the moment. That’s probably at Trudeau’s request.
It’s all over Canadian News you moron. Ours News outlets don’t make up lies or falsehoods to sway public opinion like @FoxNews and @realDonaldTrump do.
Because they don’t have the facts! When they do know something, they share it. Speculation is self-serving stupidity!
Every Canadian News Channel website that I use, and even MSN Canada, keep updating the story as it unfolds. I doubt many TV stations are interrupting programming for BREAKING NEWS bulletins.
The tragedy happened yesterday, fool. If you weren't golfing you would have sent this tweet then.
You have no idea what he was doing yesterday.

Thank you President Trump for your amazing leadership!
He’s not gonna let you touch it.
This would be a good clap back for Joey Mann and Jacob Wohl 
Oh yeah you mean the Ruskie Trump Troll Bot Brothers
That’s them #botboys
Bot boys, bot boys, whatcha going to do? Whatcha going to do when they come for you? 

And still no mention of those black victims by the white killer here in our own country (Nashville)?
Took Obama 6 days, oh wait he NEVER thanked this hero who literally took bullets to prevent a shooter from killing more people... Feel stupid yet?    Obama slow to honor the man who rushed the killer in Oregon.
Whataboutizums......lol
That’s called facts... try learning them.
That wasn’t an opinion piece.  Obama never thanked him.

He never did though.
Yeah, what she said!
As a Canadian, I don't even take his tweet seriously. How can I? How can I believe he's sincere about what happened here when he doesn't give a shit about Americans? MF has his own agenda... always! Loved your tweet btw. 
Trust me, he's not sincere
Oh, I know. I've tweeted that repeatedly, even to him. Funny, he never answers. I really wish he WOULD bcuz then I could tell him to FO - then I'd block him!

Day #458 of the hostage situation. Evil Captor has not one word for the four murdered black hostages killed by the white guy, but gives a shout out to Canada, so hostages can safely assume it was a brown dude driving.
@jamesalandarby
I love this Do you do it everyday!
Hostage situation? Yes.
Still nothing from you about the Nashville attack?
I think your motto was "America First"?  Why don't you mention the right-wing maniac who attacked minorities in Nashville?
Thank you for being a caring, compassionate President! Trump 2020!!
oh  Lord bless the weak minded...



I’m stealing both 

@SashaLakic
Don’t hide from terror face it head in
It's great to support Canada after the killings but what about the 4 Americans who were slaughtered in a TN Waffle House?  What about the brave amazing heroic American James Shaw Jr who not only saved lives but started a gofundme for the victims!
Well said.  This is really a disgrace.  It would take him less than a minute to tweet in honor of this American hero.  The fact he won't just confirms what alot of people already think about him: He's racist.
What about the Waffle House shooter?
What about Chicago
what about Las Vegas
More deaths in chicago everyday, Miss me wit that bullshit lmaoo
More deaths to come of people are to hear that trash for music you make kid....
I am sorry kid, are you trying to have a conversation?
talk that shit, you got some growing up to do lmaoo
Thoughts and prayers ain't shit.
vans are used for transportation and ar 15s for killing only

No recognition for the hero who saved lives in Memphis. Incredibly disappointing. But then again, not at all surprising.
Go back and listen to the WH press briefings.
Also, unless I missed something, the POTUS himself has not addressed this -- has he? I could care less what SHS says. She is a lying liar who lies. As is he, but it means something for him to acknowledge and give credit where due. If I missed it, please correct me.
No she’s not a lib


My thoughts and prayers are with all involved in this tragic incident and with the people of Toronto.
What about our own recent #racistdomesticterrorism ? #AmericaFirst???
#JamesShawJr #HERO
Out of couriosity does Mr. Shaw have a twitter or FB account? Not only would I like to follow him but I would like to email him thanking him for his heroics. I can't find him on either platform.
I think FB only...
Ok thanks. I will look again in a minuet.
I sure hope he decides to run for office someday. He can bring about SUCH needed change!
Agreed. He needs to put his courage to good use!
But Americans don't stand with you.
bet hoe
People with hay fever or cystic fibrosis are also more likely to develop this problem....
And the AMERICAN Waffle House shooting? Weren’t you the America first guy?
How nice that you took time to tweet about an act of terror in Canada yet you have yet to mention the act of terror in Tennessee. Many shot with four deaths until an unarmed courageous man tackled the shooter. There is no excuse for your silence about this...
Have any reporters asked him why he hasn’t mentioned it??
I haven't heard any ask him. @PressSec mentioned it yesterday on behalf of Trump but he hasn't spoken or tweeted about it himself.
Ohhhh but we don't want thoughts and prayers from a criminal like you, donald !

Hey, .@POTUS, white lady in #Utah here, wondering WHEN IN THE HELL you're going to comment on mass-murder of 4 people in Nashville 2 days ago

You posted 20+ tweets about "witch hunts" (& every other thing) this weekend--BUT NOT 1 WORD ABOUT THE MURDER OF 4/OTHERS INJURED
A white domestic terrorist shot up a Waffle House with an AR-15 and killed 4 people. He was stopped by an unarmed black man who, so far, has raised over $40,000 in donations for the victims. Not a peep from you.
We stand with the victims. Not with Trudeau.

BEST PRESIDENT EVER

Isn’t that the truth
One day you'll cough up enough courage to admit they all lied to you. 

Enjoy his second term.
Actually.  His first term is really enjoyable, from a comedic standpoint.  The man is a clown, one of the best clowns.  Other clowns wish they were as clownish.  He only hires the best clowns to clown along with.   Russia sure backed him though, huh?
A clown that did more In 1 year than Obama did in 8. 

Still pushing trump/ Russia conspiracy theories? 

It's already sad you fell for it but the fact you still believe it... jeez.
I guess we’ll see?  But yes a clown, a divisive, ignorant, liar.  Nothing good to say about the man or his administration.  Btw- why do his supporters always bring up Obama?  Is it a fetish?  Why assume because I think trump is a clown, it makes me an obama fan?
Btw- lots of plea deals for a witch hunt aren’t there?  Lots of evidence for witchcraft, no?  God Bless America!
Where are your, "thoughts and prayers" for the young people shot and killed at Waffle House?  Or your thank you to the young man who stopped the shooter?  You're a POS.
@POTUS, I'm sorry, I do NOT stand with Trudeau, he is a Globalist Shill and he's destroying Canada. I have family there and they are afraid to walk the streets in Toronto. The terrorism is getting worse daily.
Hi, Toronto checking in, no terrorism today, none yesterday, probably none tommorow.
Your family must be in a different Toronto.
Your racism is so blatant that no one can ignore it anymore. Four people were killed in Nashville house by a white supremacist nutcase and you say nothing.  #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacy
If you really stand with Canada (and not Russia) you would have offered thoughts and prayers  YESTERDAY....when it happened.
What about the Waffle House shooting????
You know that there was a Waffle House mass shooting in your backyard, right? I see that you're conspicuously quiet about that,  tho.
what about the hero who saved many in the Waffle House shooting - oh yea, he's Black and the shooter is white -  racist Trump doesn't care about that.
Who stands with us?
Curious there @realDonaldTrump where's your tweet to the four victims killed here in America while have an early breakfast...do you stand with them, their families, the community? #WafflehouseStrong
PLS 4 ONCE IN UR LIFE PRESIDENT HUMPTY DUMPTY DELETE UR TWEET WE WANT NOTHING FROM U. IT TOOK U OVER 24HRS 2 MENTION US, IT'S OK WE NO U HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS 2 DO, U HAVE 2 LIE & MAKE SURE U DON'T GO 2 JAIL. UR GOING 2 B LOVED BY THE MEN IN JAIL. WE R BETTER OFF WITHOUT U.
Ronny Jackson goes under the bus.  thump, thump.

next up?
thx god emperor trump
Trudeau is a pawn of Soros et al
Sorry @JustinTrudeau. I stand with #TorontoStrong 

Donnie, why aren't you so gracious about Americans who are killed by terrorists in America who happen to be white?  Or unarmed black men shot by police?

#RacistInChief #BlackLivesMatter #TrumpRussia #CohenFlipped #ImpeachTrump
Still no comforting words for our tragedies or praise for our heroes? America First?
There was a tragedy in America too. Thanks to the courage of JAMES SHAW JR. The number of people killed wasn’t more than four, if he hadn’t been so brave it would have been much higher.
It’s a disgrace, shameful, that you don’t even thank him. You’re rotten to the core, Trump.
Thank you but our idiot PM is the problem!
He is part of a far greater problem!
A greater force than him. But ya he also has that disease.
Did you know there was a #terrorist shooting at a #WaffleHouse in TN this week?
This #WhiteSupremacist was shooting people of color and an unarmed good guy stopped the bad guy with a gun.
Are you keeping quiet because the hero is black, or because he didn't use a gun?
It's meaningless coming from someone who has neither.
Were you ever planning on giving credit to the hero who wrestled the gun away from the Waffle House shooter or no because he’s not white?
Ummmm... Waffle House. Tennessee. US. An unarmed man wrestled an AR15  from the shooter. Where are the "thoughts & prayers" for US  citizens? I guess @FoxNews didn't report the murders.
The hero wasn't white, so naturally Fox News doesn't  recognize it as a heroic act.
What about our country? No mention of the loss of life in the Tennessee mass shooting???  Why do we have to beg you to honor Americans who we’ve just lost? I know the answer but I want to hear you say it!  #RacistTrump
Are you standing with the people in Tennessee who are victims of the hate crime by the man who currently has a bond when we have black men in jail awaiting trial with no bond for non-violent drug offenses? Can you tweet about that Mr. President? @realDonaldTrump
Also... consider reality
Who knew lower taxes/putting Iran on notice/denuke talks with N. Korea/ agreeing to fair trade/ISIS /lowest unemployment since ‘01/best stock market ever/record GDP growth was a disastrous Presidency?
If his name was Obama media would rank Trump #1 POTUS ever to…
Very nice but still nothing on the Waffle House shooting?  Black victims, white shooter, black UNARMED hero doesn't fit your narrative?  And nothing on your tenant who died in Trump Tower after you didn't want to pay for fire sprinklers?  Very selective "thoughts and prayers".
#BanRentalVans

And the attacker is a white male misogynist. One of your supporters no doubt.
Hey...how about the 4 young people killed here in a Waffle restaurant.  AND the brave young man who ended the killing.  Anything?
How about the 4 Americans killed by a white domestic terrorist on 
American soil in Tennessee? You gonna keep on ignoring that?
Donny... 4 Americans were shot to death by an assault rifle in Tennessee. Thoughts and prayers as usual or nah?
Have you spoken to James Shaw Jr., a real American hero??
Does anybody still think this man isn’t racist after he failed yet again to condemn white supremacy and acknowledge a black hero in the eyes of millions of Americans?He called NFL players SOBs just bcoz they were protesting against racial injustice.
No word on the Waffle House gun murders? Or the hero James Shaw who took him on? #JamesShawIsAHero #TrumpIsARacist #BoycottAssaultWeapons #GunControlNow #NRAisaterroristorganisation #NRAbloodmoney

That's a big HE'LL YEAH
I'll stand with the Canadian people. But Trudeau can take a hike.
Trudeau and Macron are real leaders, unlike you. In the face of tragedy, you're selective about who you support. What about James Shaw Jr., the hero of the Waffle House shooting? Do you support him? I guess not, since you haven't bothered to even mention that tragedy.
Trudeau is far from a "Real Leader" #Scheer2019
More so than trump is
yeah definitely more so than trump but Trudeau is worsening our economy, our federal debt hit 1 trillion dollars under his government
#Trudeau is the worst Prime Minister in Canadian history. We had a terrorist attack & what does he come out with,inclusion?! Nothing about his first priority keeping Canadians safe & secure. Oh no, Mr. Peoplekind wants to pander to his liberal base! Can’t wait to vote him out.
you won't because the alternatives suck harder....
No i'm completely content with @AndrewScheer, anything is better than a liberal gov.
sorry but with Scheer - women and our country will be taking a step backwards.....can't you see the problems they are having south of the border??
outh of the border? You mean America, where they don't want people jumping over the border LIKE WE DON'T!! Scheer is our only hope! Trudope was electing on making weed legal, not inviting every terrorist into this beautiful country of 36 million! He changed the national anthem
yeah you have a point there - not fussy about everyone jumping the queue to get up here and away from all that bigotry down there......but at the same time I feel bad for them - they feel they need a safe place and I guess we seem safe to them....I don't like what Scheer says tho
Also at least Scheer is going something about it and not pretending it doesn't exist or stick his head in the sand.
I will be moving this motion, supported by the Conservative Party and @AndrewScheer, in the House this morning around 10:15am EST calling on Trudeau to fix his failure to manage our borders. You can watch…
I don't like the entire "detention centre" approach to this....just send them back and have them apply the same way everyone else has to.....
No comment still on the Nashville shooting?  Wonder why.....
Why are you silent about the Terrorist attack in Nashville? US citizens were murdered. You are the POTUS for all citizens, not a select few.
You are a Traitor!. Nashville killings happened in real time and you're sending thoughts and prayers to Canada?. Any other country but your own right Trump?. Gottcha.
Where are your thoughts and prayers for the victims of the Waffle House you know where more blood on your hands was spilled
What about Waffle House? Oh, I forgot, they were all people of color.
Interesting you did not issue a similar statement concerning the Waffle House in Tennessee.  It gives the impression you can more about Canadians than you do Americans. Maybe if the shooter was Muslim it would have gotten a response from you.
Prayers with Canada and, Mr. Trump perhaps you could recognize James Shaw Jr?  FYI he is the man who saved other people's lives in the waffle house mass shooting.
Mr. President, you still have not addressed the shooting in Tennessee.  Why?  What kind of demon spawn of Satan are you?  Four dead and you have no words of condolence for the families or the nation.  You are a fraud.
I stand with the Canadian people NOT #MuslimBrotherhood/Hezbollah terrorist #JustinTrudeau !
More thoughts and prayers. I call BS, #trump. I don't believe you've spent even one minute thinking about #Canada, much less actually praying.
hello my friend how are you, good luck

He should have been shamed into it by now.  Likely to say something soon or have someone else do it
Posting about Canada's tragedy is a slap in the face to the victims AND the hero.
President Trump: Trudeau does not does speak for most Canadians.  He is an idiot without a “set”
Where are your "thoughts and prayers" for the families of the Nashville shooting victims?
Will mention Trudeau but no mention of the hero who stopped the Waffle House nut job.  Racist asshole fake potus

Trudeau doesn't care Mr. Trump. He is a globalist cuck boy. Our borders bleed with Illegals everyday and he does nothing. He is a Canadian Democrat, he is destroying Canada financially and dividing us the same way Obama did the us. Saul Alinskys students. Trudeau is the enemy!
You support Canadian victims, but still no mention of Nashville Waffle House shooting hero James Shaw, Jr. and the four young Americans who lost their lives.
Americans stand with you and all of Canada, Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all. #TorontoStrong https://twitter.com/justintrudeau/status/988823568355078145 …
“Thoughts and prayers” again. 
The shooter took a page from your book, Donald. He’s a crazy woman-hater. Oh, and a racist.
Notice how Mr. Trudeau’s tweets are lucid and supportive, not filled with vitriol and anger? Lessons in leadership.

I stand with Canada but not their PM. He is a total moron. I hope Canada will vote him out ASAP

What is wrong with you??? We had a mass shooting in Nashville 2 days ago!!! White guy with an AR15! 4 dead! Hero who stopped it was UNARMED BLACK MAN!! Nothing to say?? Who are you???
He's disgusting. It's more important to impress.  We are not the important people.
He just likes to put it out there so the people who are unable to detect nuanced behavior and only work on "face value" can confirm that "He cares" about more than himself.  Truth of the matter, he's not even tweeting this.  Look how well it's phrased.

A sex. Change maybe...?
i am #FARVA XD.

Not a FREACKING WORD about what happened in The Waffle House and the loss of life not even naming the HERO WITHOUT A GUN !!!!
But you send the famous “THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS” that mean absolutely NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow. We are all #Torontostrong but do you have any words for our own American #WaffleHouseHero that took down a shooter with his bare hands? Saving lives in the process??

Where are your kind words for the guy who, without a gun, stopped a guy with an AR from killing more people at a Waffle House in the United States of America? You have been silent. We have been watching. He is black. You are a racist.
Dude, this happened yesterday! It's not like a paper you can turn in late. Still waiting on your thoughts and prayers for the waffle House shooting.
Two words ....

WAFFLE HOUSE!!!

Why have you not mentioned the terrorist act in your own country!? #TrumpResign #TrumpRussia #MoronInChief
I too support Toronto. I love the people of Canada and respect their president. I’m disappointed that my president never spoke out about the tragedy in our country where a white man with a gun killed 4 black people and was stopped by a brave black man without a gun.
Nothing about the Waffle House massacre? Where are your "thoughts and prayers" for the four people killed there?
What about Nashville? Anything? Anything at all? I win. You mentioned Toronto before Nashville.
Canada despises you Trump
We stay with Canada to Canada
Canada doesn't want your thoughts and prayers. Canada doesn't want anything to do with you. The world was a better place until you became President #makedonalddrumpfagain #MuellerIsComing #TrumpResign
Maybe we should have that Canadian Police Officer teach American police to shoot less. That officer was so brave and no one had to die.
Why are you silent on the tragedy that took place at the Waffle House?!? I’ll wait... #BLM
Funny #Dotard .... hates you
Frankly, the prayers are so much talk, Donnie.
Just wondering Fake Christian-in-Chief...how do you pray & to whom?
Sock boy has to go....

Thoughts and prayers to a tragedy in Canada, a foreign country. But no thoughts and prayers for the tragedy in Tennessee, a US state!
WTF.
What about the people @WaffleHouse ???? Crickets..........
We don’t want you anywhere near our country @realDonaldTrump
You with your thoughts and prayers again!!! @JustinTrudeau likely cares not one bit for them. On behalf of Canada, kindly just forget we exist. Thanks 
He stands with Toronto but not the victims and families in Tennessee. Is this part of making America great again
Took you long enough. You’re a disgrace.
What about the victims of the Waffle House shooting in Nashville?
Why do you care about Canadians more than Americans?
Is it because the victims, and the hero are not white and you're just a sad racist?
We already know that that's exactly what it is.
Absolutely. USA is with CANADA.
And yet nothing about the #WaffleHouseShooting 
Call yourself a President?
We don't.
This happened yesterday. Right on top of things, as usual, you doddering old fart.
Trudeau said it was an incident, while an "attack" of hijab hoax. Such an infamous word picker.
Nothing like a hashtag call out to convey my deepest condolences.  #sosadsosorrywhenisteetime
But do YOU stand w/ #Tennessee &the 4BLACKpeople murdered by white "good people"supremacists Reinking? Have you reached out to thank Mr. Shaw for bravery &putting his life on the line to save many others? @kanyewest you got shit TWISTED it's your new brother who HATES black ppl!
Looks like the killer in Canada was actually not an Islamic terrorist. He was a copy cat killer(copying Elliot Rodgers of SAN Francisco) with mental health issues (type of autism) & hated females for often rejecting him. Same with Rodgers who was the killers.Both parents so sad!
You letting everyone to Canada.  You are a fool!
And still not a word about the white domestic terrorist in TN who killed four black people and was stopped by a black unarmed man. What an absolute horror of a person you are. #ShitholePresident

What about the victims in the USA at the Waffle House. Why no comment on that incident @potus?
That's nice, what about Waffle House? #deadblackfolks
