Great speech; reflective of everything he has said! Where's that flip flop the MSM talks about! #trump being #trump
and you have the beauty of Liz Taylor
Ann...I don't have any data to support this but I believe Trump is going to win.  Man I really hope I am right.
It surprises me that you think Trump's 'speech' as magnificent. You seem to prefer speeches spoken in German.
Well that cements it. No chance at winning because people with a brain are horrified by this speech
I think you meant German's WWII leader not Churchill.
RT @AnnCoulter: I hear Churchill had a nice turn of phrase, but Trump's immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given.
Churchill would have died laughing listening to a @realDonaldTrump speech.
if you're batshit crazy. Lol
- Delusional you are my dear.
@realDonaldTrump wtf? For real? Lmao whatever
Are you dizzy and light-headed from all this spinning you're trying to do?
Are you spinning over Hillary being a soon to be orange jumpsuit criminal!! Fraud/Obstruction of Justice mean anything
Well look at you! Did you type that all by yourself? Make sure the grown ups give you a shiny sticker for that accomplishment!
Maybe you should get a frog sticker!!! Hillary is a lying, thieving, murderer. If you fact check you'd know. #frogvideohillary
And what's your proof of these claims?
@cshirky see you got over his flip-flopping (even though he was flip-flopping all the way through it!)
MY corrupt(aus)media cut off 2nd half of his speech but otherwise this we can agree Ms Coulter,he knows how 2 deliver grt speech
@raybae689 
It was no Neville Chamberlain!

@realDonaldTrump GET SERIOUS!!! Guess he was inspired by God!! LMAO
@realDonaldTrump no. No one gave a better speech than Churchill.
are you nuts?
I get it:  sarcasm!
.@AnnCoulter
I used to defend you.
He's a liberal because he disagrees? You are what is wrong with the Right.
So disagreeing with you is PC? Google Political Correctness before tweeting about it. Sad!
You're an ignorant embarrassment.
I agree that Trump's immigration speech was great.
Hitler was the greatest speaker
haahahahahahahahahahaha...oh that's funny ..
a tiny ripple of hope
The best I have ever ever ever heard!
easily as good as Nuremberg, for sure
Sieg Heil. Scary.
nah, mostly white supremacists and the donald for elevating them
Thank God for the Sickle Cell.
Ann Coulter, you are a complete nutcase if you think anything Trump says or does is magnficent
@realDonaldTrump I smell another brown-noser
The most ass kissing comment EVER given.  Paid sychophant!  Jeez, could you be more subtle.
@realDonaldTrump amen! 
@ComedyCentral roast of @RobLowe -you came onto his Roast to promote your poorly misinformation of a book- and promoting Trump-
Churchill? Churchill was one of the greatest leaders in the past century. Trump is no Churchill!
@Jessicole25 @AnnCoulter he isn't a pimple on Churchills ass the shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence
can't wait for your cookbook, ann
I'm sure her recipes would include the fingers of babies and the paws of kittens. #SheIsSatan
Your newest book (like all the others) is superb.  Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump Ann Coulter and Donald Trump: moderately stupid people pretending to be crazy stupid for attention.
@Seven_Oaks_ what pills are you hyped up on? He has no basis for his rhetoric
I refuse to endorse spineless Trump who insults family & POW. He's a flesh peddling scum
They (Obama & Hillary) leave our men defenseless having to get approval first SMH
you weren't there, can't prove a thing. Learn to speak Russian  comrade
My Dad was a Marine too.  Died last year from severe agent orange poisoning in Vietnam.
your dad is always a Marine & if he ever knew how bad Trump treated POWs, families & being 5x draft dodger, #NeverTrump
hahahaha.
What are you laughing at? Think you can do better? Step up then!
comparing Trump to Churchill? Hahahaha!!!
Who made that comparison? You?
no you dope. Read Coulter's original tweet. She did.
guess the q 'what are u laughing at' was literal. They actually didn't know. Just saw laughter, got curious
@elishamaldonado
HOW DARE?!? Sorry, Churchill is not a throw-out comparison. That's one of the most offensive things ever heard.
hahahahahahahahahahaha
@realDonaldTrump Trump is not Jesus, in trump I don't Trust.
Right on Ms. Coulter please keep up the good work you are doing.
ref attached.../
you must be smoking pot
WikiLeaks: Now Clinton demeans faith groups...both Catholics and Evangelicals... Must get this out
@realDonaldTrump chicos, remember this... #Latinos are strong than ever, loud and clear, #latinosMatter!
drinking again
you are thinking of a different Churchill
No I think she got the right Churchill, he was a shitty Prime minister too..
Do you even believe this shit you type?
Good to see Ann is back on the Trump train..and How!
according to sources vicente fox wants speech in spanish so he can like it
To paraphrase the way Fox put it,  Trump IS GOING to build that F***ing wall.
the age of reason liberals
These Dems as now constituted are gloves-off socialists, no longer even trying to run from it, calling selves "Progressives"
well said
*LIAR
Another Drumpf puppet. Heil Drumpf his performance is award winning. GET THE FACTS.
*hail
All the John Birch Soceity types come out of the wood work. Their savior has arrived. Only 1
I've been out of the wood work since this campaign began.  It's called activism not JBS!
Heil Drumpf Da Savior. Listen to all facts come out of his mouth. Only he can do it. HaHa
Whatever... Where are you from?
@realDonaldTrump PHENOMENAL speech
@realDonaldTrump Oh yeah, he put the Gettysburg Address to shame, Ann. MLK's I Have a Dream? Psh child's play.
I think so to the best speech ever, said what he needed to say hope the world is really listening
@realDonaldTrump No darling, it was Hitler, before he rounded up the Jews!
@realDonaldTrump Totally agree.  Looking at fixing the root of problem first while moving forward with other priorities.
@realDonaldTrump apparently this is the first and only speech you've seen and heard.
@realDonaldTrump you Hannity and Trump America's newest Three Stooges
@realDonaldTrump Sick people.
Professional troll confirmed
@realDonaldTrump hi Ann this was the most amazing speech I ever heard.i am so proud of Mr trump.first the Mexico meeting and the
No one has Trump's guts. He face problems, not run away from it. Leadership! Brilliance shinning upon us again! He will fix it
@realDonaldTrump 
Churchill and Trump in the same sentence. That's a stretch even for Ann Coulter.
@realDonaldTrump uhmm.......no
@realDonaldTrump Brilliant audition by Ann Coulter to ghost write #AmnestyDon After the Fall.
@realDonaldTrump WHAT?  You are comparing Trump to Churchill?!?
It would be remarkable anytime, but today's climate makes it really stupendous
@realDonaldTrump that blonde hair must be real
@realDonaldTrump Ann WHO? (& don't even TRY 2 come back w/ "Jim WHO?", as I'm respected by more than u EVER have been/will be.)

CHURCHILL??? The #Trump speech was much closer to #Hitler. He revealed that he is a heartless merciless SOB. #tcot #gop #dnc
@realDonaldTrump Magnificent. Like his hands. Admit it, you've got the hots for Don. #AnnLovesDon

@realDonaldTrump I   your the best.
@realDonaldTrump I believe Churchill was familiar with more words above the two-syllable threshold.
the dems panic this morning confirms it...
@realDonaldTrump some bloke called Adolf was a great orator too
@realDonaldTrump the speech confirmed that the uneducated and racist white will vote for Trump. CAN'T win without LATINO VOTE
guess you haven't been to a lot of speeches lately!
@realDonaldTrump how can u mention Churchill & Trump in the same sentence u have zero credibility & should shut up & go away
Yeah but Hitler never used a teleprompter.
you've got to be kidding!!! What color is the sky on the planet you are on?
Magnificent pile of bigoted bullshit.  Only a simple minded fool or a like-minded bigot would support @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
TELL YOU WHAT ! I WISH I WAS THERE TO GO 2 HIS RALLIES THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKIN!!
@realDonaldTrump yes Trump 2016. No one can lead this country better than Trump. Politicians are Liars. http://CrushMax.com 
He sounds even better than Stalin!

@Trump_for_USA Says the Fascist-loving, Constitution-hating Coulter. I'm not surprised. #TraitorTrump
http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/08/major-clinton-foundation-donor-denied-entry-into-u-s-due-to-terror-ties.php â€¦.  Maybe you should rethink your plan.
Hopefully the end of the Burglars in America.
Are kidding me?!?!?!
--- and Ann shows the lasting health effects of peroxide overdoses.
Magnificent? Only if you are a member of the Klan
i agree
@realDonaldTrump no it wasn't. Your just happy he did it so you can make money on your book.
@realDonaldTrump #Dumbo #Unfit4POTUS #Fascist #TrumpLies
@realDonaldTrump Ann. Oh Ann. U need to do a day of charity work
The point is that power in the US lies with the people but it's been confiscated by government. @realDonaldTrump will restore it
the cost-benefit of the wall is what I question more
what about jesus's speach on the mt of olives!
come on
@realDonaldTrump Anna are you seriously support Trump? If so, why?
@CochraneCBC please, don't compare that jackass to Churchill.  Churchill was a leader & his cigar was reportedly much bigger
Hmmmmm.......
Really? @AnnCoulter Trump's speech most magnificent ever? Not Kennedy, Churchill, Martin Luther King Jr, Socrates, Gandhi? Ummm No! #idiot
@realDonaldTrump :You should talk to your Dr. to have your med's up'd by a lot.

Step away from the feed bag! Guess you never listen to JFK did ya Mr.Ed?
@realDonaldTrump lmaaaaao
@realDonaldTrump Will lead us to make #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Nothing wrong to put our country 1st   Build the wall 
Are you high or just drunk?
@realDonaldTrump If there were an infinite number of alternate universes, in not one of them would this statement be true.
Comparing one of the greatest statesmen in history to Trump?  Words fail me.
@realDonaldTrump @JoeGrimes82 are you that shallow?
Just rebuild America. Put another nickel in.
Are most people aware Hispanics will be majority & make laws? May not be so willing to make illegals citizens
 good one
@realDonaldTrump Was it as good as Hitler's?
Beyond parody.
@realDonaldTrump how?

#NeverTrump Your slavish, fawning slack-jawed adoration of tRump smacks of cultism.  You are disgusting and always have been.
@realdonaldtrump you are both idiots and live in world of your own fantasies.
Trump went to Mexico yesterday morning, gave a speech in Arizona last night, now going to do a speech this morning! Boom! MAGA!
@realDonaldTrump i didnt think genuine trump supporters actually existed but here we are
Anything to sell a book , huh Ann ?

@realDonaldTrump "most magnificent speech ever given". Really?REALLY? How can you say that with a straight face? Sellout
@realDonaldTrump wait  wait, "ever, " really?
God Help Us
you are remedial.
possibly the greatest absurdity of the written word..
Anne, I respect you. Please enlighten how flip flopping is to be encouraging?
@realDonaldTrump @LearnDreams

.@AnnCoulter @cocosbentmind she's back
Now I know it's a failure - Little Orphan Annie liked it.
your cuntness is outstanding.
...for people who don't like complete sentences perhaps. #TrumpAZ
@realDonaldTrump He has to win
What a load of bullshit comparing Trump's speech to Churchill and please never appear in British TV again with your lies!!!!
@realDonaldTrump 2 days and I am still laughing.
Totally right @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump
This was more magnificent
@realDonaldTrump you are both smiling crack.  I fear all you both said and dictatorship under Herr Trump.
Magnificent? Only if #ToxicTrump is talking to white supremists
The ugliest broad in the republican landscape is lying through her teeth again...who did u do to get published
But @jimmycarr 's  meditations on you were prophetic; now that was a good speech!
@realDonaldTrump she's even funnier than he is !!!!!  "Magnificent"??? Really? I mean, really? That's hilarious. #
So you realize this means he is going to lose the election right?  Even if you hate hispanics, you need them to win election
@realDonaldTrump porque hay personas tan estupidas como ustedes dos ?
You're delusion Trump not going to build a Wall despite giving you & da base all da red meat you crave;  u bullied him Congrats
Hyperbole.  Good day for campaign.  Pls learn auto script/prompter.
Did you write it, @AnnCoulter?
@realDonaldTrump I agree but you have the media on Hillarys side you never hear negative from CNN?
@realDonaldTrump Bull it was angry, mean spirited, dark, and negative. Had nothing found in a good speech. Go write a fn' book.
@realDonaldTrump the" most magnificent speech ever written" really? How's your book doing? 
@realDonaldTrump wtf, you love everything that orange fool spits out 
@realDonaldTrump Nazi Brown Shirts rise again Don is bi-polar and needs medication
