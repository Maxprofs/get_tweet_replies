@RichTVXChannel that's so beautiful. Thank you for sharing w/us!!
we've not gotten to see any decor in many , many years. I appreciate you sharing.
How adorable. Tiny Hands needs a fake photo to make himself feel better. I'm starting to think there really is a problem down there.
I think the photographer is just trolling him. The photo is dated Jan. 21. The day of the #WomensMarch 
Good eye!  
.@realDonaldTrump Haha!!! Jan 21? Women's march photo I take it?
That or some fine Photoshop work  pasting in multiple sections of the same audience. Easily done.
I know. I work in Photoshop and Illustrator all the time. I've dissected this pic and it seems legit though.
zoom in. The photo says January 21st...The day of the Women's March. Whoops.
Abbas is an Iranian! Iranians are not terrorist!
#MuslimBan #notbanstudentvisa
this is beautiful.
that shit is photoshopped stop Lyin
.@realDonaldTrump has wrong date on it fella
Fantastic - a photo of the Women's March on 21st January.  Much bigger crowd
came to america. For it was build up from scratch when european immigrants moved to the promised land
you're cooked mate, wrong photo dick cheese
That's the date of the largest protest in US history. Jan 21, 2017 thanks for recognizing us!
I am so proud of Americans who showed up in droves to support American dream for all people on Jan 21.
@Tee_Quake 
Go Pres Trump! Why put pic of BO s mass crowd...oh yah thats right this is PRES DONALD TRUMPS MASS CROWD!! 
Bwwaaaahahaha! Think the White House needs to add a new wing just to hold Trump's ego!! #embarassing
A photo shopped photo to help your poor ego
January 21st, hmmm
#Inauguration #photo 
I just had to revive this old thread Uncle Donnie. I'm curious. Who is this man that was taking the photo of the photo. You can clearly see a young man holding a camera with a flash up top in his hand in the reflection of the glass.
If I'm not mistaken I believe that's  @EricTrump in the glass.
btw for everyone else, i'm not trying to offense jews, german ppl or any other minoruty or community that suffered in ww2
*minority. My grandfather was captured and held in an encampment
Take down the nasty painting of Hillary & replace it with this Mr. President.
@Tee_Quake @ChastityTamu That's awesome
Since @realDonaldTrump @POTUS likes crowds in his name so much, I suggest displaying this photo in the #WhiteHouse:
Donald Trump may go down in history as the man who managed to unite the world against hate and racism. This was today, in London. 
isnt abbas a muslim guy? pls throw him out of america #MAGA
do you have any other adjectives to bring to the table? If not, go to the Library and GRAB SOME
lol
.@realDonaldTrump it's like taking a picture of the front row and claiming the theater was a sell out. #obamaHasMoreClass #WeThePeople
Ahh January 21st. The day millions of women around the world marched against you.
#thankyoutrump for confirming what we the People already believe about you!You are a narcissist crazy angry unloved man sad
, the date is wrong - just like your presidency.
LOL  that is a photo from Jan 21, the #WomensMarch .  Thanks for honor #GetAClue
this is a photo of people protesting you on January 21st. I'm so happy you chose to memorialize it in the White House
Um, Donald, @realDonaldTrump the photo is of the women's march, not the inauguration. So sure, put it in the press hall as a sign of failure
THANK YOU for honoring our WOMEN'S MARCH! We never imagined you hang photos of us! #icantkeepquiet #100days
@POTUS Oh and that's not photoshopped AT ALL.
@bagr47 Beautiful sight!!!!
@POTUS sure hope the Trump horror show will be over soon!!!
@POTUS alternative photos now!!!
@POTUS false pictures,now,you are desperate!!!

We The People Demand that you Release Guadalupe Garcia De Rayos Now!

Dear president,Abbas is Iranian .the country you have banned!you should nothave. thankedaterrorsit Abbas should beon notice

Angle of shot avoids looking down the Mall towards Washington Monument where empty spaces are
i could do a better #Photoshopscam

"Guys, where can I download a 'people' brush for Photoshop?"
I love photoshop... it even makes YOU look big @realDonaldTrump

@POTUS #looser #learn to count
@maharbeth Also pls take a Panoramic of your hands!!! Big boy!!

President Trump you had the whole world watching. Remember HHA in Florida
You SAD little man. #notmypresident, #tinyhands, #ReleaseYourTaxes #ImpeachTrump
he is the president.  So he didn't have bus loads of welfare breeders
Hey Prez! Instead of TWEETING your plans for decor, how bout you bring back affordable healthcare, or read a goddamn book
. Enjoyphoto of your Inauguration from the steps of Capitol!Those people were there for you in & BELIEF in U.We in spirit!
still not bigger than Obama's you fraud.
#saudis OK #qataris OK,...but banning #iranians frm coming to #US !? Make no sense to me!
@POTUS. Good try, Donnie dear...Obama's inauguration in 2009 with the date changed--check the photographer's website.
let's compare crowd size to hand size so you'll understand. Obamas crowd? Real man hands. Your crowd?  Trump baby hands.
photo shop can do so much thank you photo shop
@POTUS awwww.... they Photoshopped it for you and everything. #TinyHandsTinyEgo #DrainTheTrump #TRUMP
Shit, I voted for an Ego? I want a redo!
I’d slap you but I don’t want to make your face look any better.
The White House should now be called The Napoleon Complex.  #babyhands btw #doomsdayclock lost a 1/2 hr. Thanks #Twitler
.@realDonaldTrump so glad you like #Obama's #inaugural photo and would honour him this way.
too bad that was the day after. The 21st. The women's March. You wish you drew that crowd...well for you anyway.
That's the women's march with 500,000 people! Half a million! LOL. Inaug attendance: 10  TV viewers: 5  PPl at inaug: 1,000
amazing what you can do with photoshop
@POTUS Shove their faces in the truth. Make the MSMeat dirt. Use TR'sMonopoly Laws to Bust em all Up. NO MORE MERGERS
more #alternativefacts this is actually a pic from the #womensmarch2017 Nice try drumpf! #fucktrump #notmypresident #resist
.@realDonaldTrump So you only hate/want to deport/deny entry to Muslims that aren't giving you shit. Funny how that works.
you're like a little child, you keep focusing on everything except being a REAL president! SO sad man with little hands
beautiful photo but caption date is incorrect - it says 21st not 20th!
great use of Photoshop.
# this isn't right,  you are so vein you'd put another crowd of people to replace your crowd. You're a big baby.
January 21st??  That was the day of the Women's March!  No one believes your lies.
why believe the man who calls everything he disagrees with "fake"? #thanksnothanks #notmypresident
photo date is wrong...The 21st is the Womens march. Get over yourself Donald.
Why hang 2 pictures of your small crowd size? Love how it's zoomed in to cut out the empty sections. #alternativefact
Get your dates right if you're going to make up a fake picture. You are unreal, Trump!
thank you Photoshop!!!
#altfacts#altreality#altprez
great pic of the women's match against you! Glad you're going to hang it!
you still didn't have the largest inauguration! Why? Because u lost the popular vote grow up and get over it! small hands!
You were inaugurated on January 20, 2017, not January 21, 2017.  Fool.
You wish people loved you like they do President Obama. Deplorables couldn't afford to come.
I'm a photographer, terrific photo. Let me know if you need another entrepreneur!
we<3 u
Jan 21 date on the framed photo... Women's March??
photoshopped 
You are so triggered and desperate
Inaguration 1/20/17. Date on picture 1/21/17. Is this more #alternativefacts ?
nice picture. The swearing in of @BarackObama was an historic moment four our nation. Nice of you to recognize that. Ass.
@POTUS looks like they broke out the free fonts for you #yay
I noticed you didn't use the aerial photo that highlights all the empty space #ResistTrump
You should have a duplicate sent to CNN, NBC, CBS, Facebook, etc...
Seriously?  Ummmm your inauguration was Jan. 20th, 2017.......NOT Jan. 21st, 2017!  Too funny!
could you please have the 10 commandment's put back in court rooms ?
@LindaKi61072348 Phony picture ! He can't except the Truth
it's a picture of the WOMEN'S MARCH....NOT UR inauguration!
so saying your supporters wore pussy hats too? I guess they were hoping you'd grab em
LOL! You made me LMAO! Please don't temp him for he is the only thing he is good at 'grabbing'
will a abbas be forced to go on your Muslim registry? Just saying.
He won't be able to have a Muslim registry because Good American will stand against it by becoming Muslims!
seriously? You have time to continue behaving like a child while you're wreaking havoc on good people!?
Why would you display a photo of Omabam's inauguration? Lol
Thank you for posting a photo of the women's march so you will remember how much we all stand against you!  #womensmarch
Did you not notice that picture is dated the 21st?
Your love affair with @realDonaldTrump has to end at some point! It's the hair, I know.
Great picture of the Women's March! Too bad you're a pathological liar, and a psychopath, and a narcissist. #FakePresident
and sexual predator
That too!
You're most welcome, your excellence.
Hahahahha
Have we all already forgotten the date of the women's march? Well thanks for hanging a picture of it up for us! #PussyPower

Good luck my friend Abbas Bakheit
So he can point to it everyday and discuss it

The only reason he put that up there is so I could say look at my crowd size
@Frances_T_Brown
