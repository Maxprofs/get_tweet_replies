Wow! Look at this terrific poll, folks! I'm losing by 6%! DISASTER! @DRUDGE_REPORT @realDonaldTrump
unfiltered (by Drudge Report) results even worse! Sad!
and apparently changing in real time.
that has filters on it. Clear and refresh. Or use reliable polling
no, I included all responses. No filters. NO FILTERS.
America only ever sends its criminals and rapists to Mexico: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-considers-last-minute-meeting-in-mexico-with-the-countrys-president/2016/08/30/5a694790-6f12-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html … @RealDonaldTrump #DopeyDonald #GOP @GOP
@washingtonpost doubt that...the clintons still live in the US
@Reuters Nope. Hillary's up by 6 pts.
click the link and remove the filters.
I did. Shows Clinton up by 6 pts.
current unfiltered.
Race is not tied. Hillary up by at least 6% even in this "poll." State by state polling matters. Aren't y'all paying att'n?
lies i really really hate these biased polls and rigged systems
Killary Clinton has lied to us so 100's that I know of have told pollsters we are voting for her, not!
numbers won't work for her when we show up and vote for Donald Trump...lol
I've asked my friends to have their friends to all be doing the same thing. Donald Trump will get his votes
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters
@DesignerDeb3 @Reuters lol lol. Trumps way ahead. More MSM hype. Trump in a landslide.
Still will be the first looser
funny.....everyone else has Hillary landslide
YOU'RE way down in the Swing states and you've got  no ground game. LOSER!
Great speech on immigration.  Our state of Florida is overrun with illegals.  They can go home!
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters How is being 8 points down considered "all tied up"?
Within the poll margin for error.We do not agree with polls or crime stats.
@AppSame #TrumpPence16 all the way baby lets show Clinton we cant be bought off!
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, if by "all tied up" you mean behind by 5 points. Lolololol
@CookingConquest Tied in a poll that heavily oversamples Democrats #TrumpLandslide
Typical MSM tactics.
#America .vs. #trump

Trump's #White #Slavery Problem.
Young girls.

@realdonaldtrump @drudge_report
On @MSNBC with @saraziff at 8:15pmET talking about @TrumpModels's immigration issues http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/donald-trump-model-management-illegal-immigration …
, take your Trump Pence 2016
bed sheet off your head. I cannot hear a word you're saying.
@realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT
Encouraging polls but the electoral map still stacked against him. Must pivot @ least 3: NC, FL, OH & PA. Bad deficit in NC.
@KatrinaPierson but you won't report on all the polls that say Hillary is way up. Most of them.
this poll was filtered by drudge. Click link and remove filters. 8 points Clinton
- Trump up 8
yeah, so that shows how inauthentic this poll is.
@realDonaldTrump draft dodging Donnie Trump
You must be a Clinton troll!!
actually I am going to vote for Clinton or Johnson. Haven't made up mind yet.
Why Clinton? What has she done to deserve anyone's vote? You need to read about Benghazi!!
and she's been cleared of any wrong doing by 9 separate witch hunts!
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters The online polls paint very diff pic.  I live in NC and everyone around loves Trump.
@realDonaldTrump ??? Doesn't look tied to me. Confused?
me too plus the numbers that are up are filtered.   I don't get it...
look what breitbart posted
I also don't see that on BreitbartNews
@realDonaldTrump You will lose in a landslide
Keep telling yourself that champ. @DRUDGE_REPORT @realDonaldTrump
Um what? Did Drudge actually follow that link? Because it says Hillary is up by 5 points.
Wow good thing that was all UPPERCASE, much more trustworthy. Speaking of 538:
@winegirl73 actually Trump should be way out in front of her! She has a rap sheet! Has done nothing for this country
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters Trump is ahead in the polls. You got it wrong.
-Hillary Clinton never for the American People- She is about greed & power- Her lying lips- Vote Trump!
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters we remember when Romney was going to win in a landslide, this same bunch believes this crap too
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters within the margin of an extreme error
@realDonaldTrump 41.9% = 36.0%!? You really do have the level of mathematical understanding to become president!!
He will be way ahead very soon!
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters The individual state polls are all  that matter. Popular vote polls are meaningless.
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters Tied up!!!! The poll are rigged Not even 200 people show up to hear Hillary the liar
@realDonaldTrump I still think this is way way off
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters no it didnt. Are you even capable of reading the poll?
@realDonaldTrump no way tie, Trump is far ahead!!!
@Reuters
@JaredWyand @Reuters Well that translates to +10 if my math is correct...doesn't it?
@realDonaldTrump You clearly went to Trump U. 42%>36%. But then denying reality is your game. Well played.
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters Drudge & Reuters...out of touch. A real national poll of 50k has Trump 67%, Hillary 19%, Others 13%
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters Lol, lol
@realDonaldTrump so now being 6 points down is "tied"
@realDonaldTrump Don't believe it!Trump is way ahead!No doubt about it!Look at how big his crowds are!Huge!
@realDonaldTrump nope try again
I saw video of registers going out with mean memes printed  of Trump and pushing Hillary on new voters ! SMH
@realDonaldTrump 42% to 36% is a tie?
@Reuters FOX NEWS POLL HAS IT AS A STATISTICAL TIE WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR.
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters 
BULLSHIT!!
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters  your needed in Ohio.....change some minds ! Need their votes !
@realDonaldTrump And this is why Trump is not qualified he lied again.
@Reuters Yes!!!!
@realDonaldTrump finally someone tells the dern truth
Trumps always been way ahead of Clinton!
@realDonaldTrump This just in from one of Trump's top pollster sources: http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-disaffected-voters-20160831-snap-htmlstory.html … #NeverTrump #TrumpLies #Unfit

Sorry, wrong again. Losing, you LOSER. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/polls.html …
quoting the idiotic right wing white supremacist publication again.
so where do you see it tied up in this report?
GO, TRUMP!!!  2016
@realDonaldTrump Trump down by six is tied? You guys aren't ever trying anymore, you didn't even read the article.
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters numbers are just proving to be a weak subject for ya'll
Drudge just took a small part of that poll and edited it..Hillary is Still up by 5-6 with a Repub pollster
But I thought the polls are rigged. the only time we cite them is when they are favorable to us. What a joke.
those are filtered results. unfiltered results have @HillaryClinton up by ~4. very misleading
Hey @realDonaldTrump:
The @DRUDGE_REPORT tweet was LYING!The @Reuters article it linked to shows Hillary AHEAD,not tied w/ur sorry campaign
nope
Which means Trump is ahead by 10 points.
@realDonaldTrump -Trump way ahead
@realDonaldTrump - that's what they want you to think. But trump is way ahead
@realDonaldTrump #neverevertrump

tax returns ?
@realDonaldTrump  illegals steal over 1 million social security numbers  fraud with citizen victims
@realDonaldTrump the polls are rigged they poll more radical extremists sympathizer democrats,  MAGA
President Enrique Pena Nieto sees this horserace and just bet on the winning horse, THE STRONGER HORSE! (Remember?).
Sorry, #tiny @realDonaldTrum...but you WILL lose 

#DaddyPutinsLittleBitch

so Mexican president refuses to pay for big mighty wall! What's ur next lie!!
The liberals will never show this poll. they are scared to death of their system getting cracked wide open.
Will Reuters "re-adjust" polling results again?
@realDonaldTrump Evidently math is not your strong point. A 6point lead is not a tie. #ManWithNoPlan #StrongerTogether
REUTERS POLL = Not Trustworthy. Period.
there are no trustworthy polls. Another media manipulation tool
Very Likely!  In GreatBritain, polls were trying to 'wag the dog'(against #Brexit) Ours are too against Trump!
http://sowa.com 
So not reliable. Most comprehensive data. Don't cherry pick - you are losing.
No  > @realDonaldTrump is leaving #HillaryClinton in the dust. He's acting like a #President already. #PrayForTrump 4 #POTUS
@Reuters the link shows Clinton up by 5? Did I miss something?
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters no they are not tied

Tied up?  The headline should be 'Trump Surging!'
Is this believable?
@realDonaldTrump Trump is loosing by 5 points and taking down other rep. Candidates
@Reuters trumps got this
@realDonaldTrump uh...don't know how to tell you this but the actual post here puts Hillary ahead. Do you read before retweet
bwahahahahaha this . . . http://bit.ly/2cqZqv6 
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters my mom who has mid level Alzheimers supports HRC. Each day I try to change her mind and succeed!

#NeverTrump #VoteBlue #UniteBlue
@Reuters Can't have a President that's only concern for "Convenience" is Greed and Power
this is ur big problem, listening, approving & adopting views of only a small fringe segment of society
Gotta be desperately searching 4 favorable poll to consider this "Poll" Let's go to BillyBob Bar & poll LOL!
@realDonaldTrump vote vote vote Trump no matter what polls say , must vote Trump
@timothy_stanley No, it doesn't

@realDonaldTrump lol I just looked at this and Hillary is winning
@realDonaldTrump  but still losing 
@realDonaldTrump
Trump loves his "Make America Great Again" hat a lot for a guy who outsourced jobs to 12 different countries. 
@realDonaldTrump within five is margin of error . Those who are other are those who are afraid to say Trump

@CarmineZozzora 
Rolling, rolling, rolling------hear the footsteps HRC!
@realDonaldTrump nice try Boo... Delete Your Account

If Millennial turnout is low, Clinton still beats Trump, says new Reuters/Ipsos interactive polling site http://www.reuters.com/statesofthenation/ … #IpsosDaily
All those REFUSED are Trump votes.
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters This says it was tighter two days ago. Her lead is growing! #DimDonald
proves to me how many ignorant people there are in USA. When Hillary get even 1 vote. How much crime does she have to commit
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters She has either a 6- or 8-point lead! #DimDonald
The only way this can be true is either the poll is rigged or America is full of idiots.
She's getting fatter and slower whilst Trump is getting fitter and and faster.
umm... he's still down near 7 points
@realDonaldTrump That CNN are so sneaky, they did an Interview with the Old failed Nasty ex President of Mexico despicable.
@realDonaldTrump http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/08/clinton-national-lead-steady.html …
@realDonaldTrump when I click that link this is what I see...  5 pts is far from tied
@realDonaldTrump :MEXICO PRESIDENT NIETO TODAY-"I WILL TELL MR.TRUMP FACE TO FACE WE DO NOT PAY FOR HIS FCKN WALL"HIJUEPUTA."
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters its pointless to argue polls 1 says up 6 another says down 8 another's says tied etc etc.
@realDonaldTrump Funny how the polls are rigged by MSM until more favorable then legit again - what a joke 
he should be 90 points up #VoteTrump
@realDonaldTrump
How the hell is 41.9% to 36% all tied up?
@Cmkahn @realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT @ReutersUS 
Reuters poll: Big difference desktop vs mobile
Default filters
look at the timeframe. It's different from mobile to desktop views.
I do not see a time-frame choice over Android.
And why wouldn't the DEFAULT TF be the most recent 5 days for BOTH platforms?
Below is what I see over desktop with the shown time frame. Is that the most current 5-day rolling average?
@realDonaldTrump Homegrown demagogue
@realDonaldTrump @Reuters So "now" you believe polls are correct?! No Asian, Black, Hispanic, women votes, = long vacation...
