Kaine lied and said NO family member draws a salary from Clinton Foundation..
Pence is a class act. Clinton Foundation is not even a rated organization!!!!!
- I agree. But @timkaine is running with the ball more, although I'm a little unhappy that he's interrupting.
I think #Kaine was off topic and interrupts interrupts interrupts...#VPDebate
- I agree Adam @timkaine is interrupting @mike_pence too much. A real turnoff. #VPDebate
OMG. KAINE IS MORE OF A JERK THAN I THOUGHT!!
Pence is great!  A real man. Kane looks like a petulant child.
Kaine is scrambling. Looks like a joker
Great pick Mr. Trump!

Pence has GOT TO INTERRUPT this guy!! Being too nice!
Pence needs to hit Kaine below the belt !!
@ofccadjust @lainey34210 When you look at this debate, Pence got the 'hole shot' out of the gate. I listened. Was strong
he's only trying to make up for your ineptitude

Hearts? What the actual f**k? #VPDebate

Does anyone believe #Trump tweeted hearts? He must be in his stright jacket. Unhinged, unfit, unelectable
why doesn't anyone say that all americans work their taxes to pay as little as possible!
He said nothing sensible. Just fumbling like u. He looks so small for eloquent Tim Kaine
your guy is in the ropes holding up
Kaine is as sleazy as Clinton
