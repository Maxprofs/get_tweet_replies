Trump you are the worst president in US HISTORY!!!
And since I do not live in the US I actually CAN :)
Seems PR was ill prepared! Not like it hasn't happened B4. Structures not built to withstand or shelters ready to help& Mayor complains?
Ahh... that would be “Democratic”.  Jesus!
Amen our emergency workers are the greatest in the world
You are doing a great job!
#ImpeachTheDotard

Too late. How many lives were lost from INCOMPOTENT POTUS response?
Trump doing a great job in Puerto Rico. My family home land. You fake media and libtards are exposed. Trump 2020. Gracias mi presidente.
Keep telling yourself that
No more bitterness/anger against this nation, we must come together God is with us, evil will not prevail. Do not grow weary continue 2 pray
The most praying President in this nation, he loves the common people. Praise God!
The military just contradicted you.  Fake news????
How does taking 10s of thousands of Muslims that Australia doesn't want benefit the people in the US? IT doesn't. Don't do it.
Thanks for your help Mr. President!  America loves you!
Great & wonderful job President!
President Trump....not Donald...not Trump....not Mr....it is President Trump and he is not God. News flash...He's human.
TRUE. Watch WIPR TV
Really? Spoke w/my mom today, lives in Canovanas, no distrib of h20, roads are open, not great but cars can trvl, no excuse 4 lack of help.
Liar
@realDonaldTrump heard that relief supplies to PR with bar codes are placed in supermarkets by corrupt PR government and sold not given out
Hey DotardDon do you even have a clue what's going on in PR? You should try getting off the golf course and try working for a change.
TERRIFIC, PREZ
Please follow as I will follow you back fan
How about apologizing to the Mayor of San Juan! Get common sense and go stay there yourself. Think that might make you think twice about saying things that are stupid.....
9 million children lost their health insurance today. Nine million.

Trump went golfing.
Our people in Puerto Rico are dying and starving, without water, gas and power. Is that what you consider a great response???
I dare you to meet with San Juan's Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz on LIVE TV / MSNBC!
the fake news media has to stop there lies about you mr president your doing a great job
As are you Pres Trump. Please know that the Trump Nation is very intelligent n we are past ignoring the media.
Your son @DonaldJTrumpJr is sending all the dead moose he slaughtered to PR for food. What a true hero!!!!
True Americans Love President Donald J. @realDonaldTrump
wish there was a way to go to Puerto Rico and be a driver and help distribution of supplies!
I don't need to PREPARE for hurricanes when living on an island. I just need that government titty. No one can accept responsibility.
People fail to realize that there was just two other major storms. Its hard to help this many people at one time effectivley.
Locals have no water, no food, no electric.....they are just trying to survive.
Trying to save 2 million people separated by an ocean isn't an easy task for any country. People need to wake up and stop pointing fingers.
Demolish, redo infrastructure in the ground, better housing on top of that. Mr. President, again you were doing a fantastic job keep it up!
They need new mayor
they need more help why don't you admit how bad it is instead of calling the news cnn liars
Just wish you had not waited so long to help.
Let the stuff LEAVE the DOCK MORON!
There has some word i want to say,''grass mire horse'',this three can bless u away from bad thing,so u should say it to friends,best whises!
Doing a great job down there
When you can physically walk over to a fridge and not push a button to get a soda then people might listen.  Acting like a trained hamster!
They have totally taken any help away from the people. That's how they are doing a great job. Screwups all.

SMOKING GUN: San Juan Teamsters Didn't Show Up for Work To Distribute Relief Supplies While US Aid Rotting At Ports  http://bb4sp.com/smoking-gun-san-juan-teamsters/ …
Chickens coming home to roost.  Sad that infrastructure has been so neglected.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Retreating your father's propaganda does not make it true. It makes you an enabler. Shame!
Thank you! We love you President Trump!
#trumpskatrina
Just more propaganda from our Nazi Leader
#TrumpsKatrina
God Bless you, Trump.
Finally got to it cheeto head.  How about that san juan golf course you bankrupted.
Someone is lying and it not the governor of Puerto Rico.
God bless you President Trump.
Man child.
Oops ANOTHER LIE!
Please stop lying. You're just plain insensitive, cruel and racist. No one takes you seriously. Just resign please. Worst president ever!!

You have no idea. And now you are vacationing again
Always Lying making it look like you are doing something...You are a Useless man. You are are toilet paper and always will be
TOO LATE.
Thanks always President! You're amazingly!
Withhold aid until they learn how to be thankful and self-sufficient.
You're inhuman.  Resign.
The den will not be happy instill you are up to your neck in mud so they can make fun of you , so to hell with them full steam ahead.
Are you a reporter or just repeating CNN? Loser!
If their houses are gone, transportation is gone, large equipment gone. Roads impassable staying alive is the only job they have left. DOI

"Locals trying..." You're an ass hat

They're doing the right thing. Can you say the same or you just gonna tweet and golf for 4yrs
The Videos from PR are telling different stories.
Maybe this is the reason Puerto Ricans can't get supplies.
HER UNION BLOCKING UNLOADING SUPPLIES AT THE PORT https://twitter.com/president1trump/status/914111416851992580 …
Too bad it took 5 days for Sr. to act.  People died while he golfed.

Too bad you're not. How's the golf game?
People are dying. There is an island and a lot of water. It may be an ocean. Please send help
Liar! Picking a fight with the wrong woman.  The San Juan mayor is going to kick your butt.  Golfing during this disaster!
Chingate #Trumpacabra
Backfeed the docks wih power from the nuclear sub. Get the port clear of containers. Declare emergency to get truckers working, or imprison.
I can say they are doing impressive! From Beaumont Tx. Wonderful job here. Thank you Mr. President
How many have you allowed to die so far?
and by locals you mean Americans?
Mayor Cruz proud of for not taking any shit from this racist President. if it was Alabama his ass would have been there.flag not worth it
Mr. Trump u discuss me you talk about Puerto Rico's debt over people's lives. I'm beginning to hate U. Your a racist married to a Russian
#FreeKekistan #TheREVOLUTION #FrightPower #TRobinsonNewEra #KTHopkins    #ReasonsForTreason #RinoSeason #GulfCityNews #SupportSmallStreamers
That's probably a lie.
SEND MORE!  TRIPLE THE HELP!
 BRAVO Mr President! Thank you so much for your hard work to halo the people of our nation heal from the alt left Islamic assault by BO
Every time you talk about how difficult it is for the military to cross an ocean, Kim Jong Un laughs at you from across the Pacific
Keep trying to lie about the support...this is your Katrina!
#fakepresident
So the mayor, 3 million people AND this general are all lying, right? 
You went golfing, didn't help, & blame them.
Massive water, big water, drinking water or ocean water, is Dotard confused about water?
Big water. Island. Big ocean. Island in water. Golf. Everything is great. 'Merica. #MAGA hat. A fly-over later on. Too much winning.
They could have done so much more if they had been allowed in immediately. Instead of over a week later. Ass
And then he tweeted again ... #AnotherTanTrum
Help dominico please
Mayor of San Juan disagrees and she's there!  Where are you....out golfing?
It is NOT a great job being done.  Happy golfing. Tell Malaria to dress for the occasion! Her gold screw me dress
Have done nothing!  Stop telling lies!
Yamelette.     Ray

While all this is going on, your at your golf club playing golf.

The Electric Grid. was the first thing to go,the way it's built(above gnd) all Islands&coastal towns Elect. should be underground
Garbage ass president

Nothing was done for days after the hurricane! People are dying there! Do more!!!
All you have to do is read this. How is your golf game today? #LazyPresident #Clueless #HurricaneHolocaust
.@DonaldJTrumpJr. I'll bet Puerto Rico wishes it had that 150 billion dollars Democrats gave to Iran!
You mean Americans who do you think will be paying for PR and bailing out their inept government who haven't fiscal clue

Here's a handy guide to how your taxes will go up, unless you make more than $471k. #PayTheirFareShare 
You are doing a horrible job.
You know nothing of what's occurring there, I'm sure u don't read, u tweet about how fab u are. Wrong..
Thank you PRESIDENT Trump.
Bullshit.  People are dying.  Children are hungry, people going without medication or hospitals.  You haven't done ANYTHING.
locals or US citizens?
They need gas to get to a job, if you don't know what to do ask people that do. Rich people like you have no idea. No winning here
