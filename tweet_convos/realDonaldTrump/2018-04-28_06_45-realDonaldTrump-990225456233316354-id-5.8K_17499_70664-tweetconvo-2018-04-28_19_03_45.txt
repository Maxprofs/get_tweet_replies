The only thing @realDonaldTrump prays for is more $$$$ for himself.
Right...that's why he is not accepting his pay for service to us and our country.
He gets paid every single time he plays golf at one of his resorts.  Not only is he vacationing and playing more golf than any other president in history, he's enriching himself via taxpayer dime every time he does so.
i hope you know he is actually working half the time hes there. foreign guests ASK to stay there for their meetings because who the hell would want to stay in washington DC with that toxic atmosphere? some history for you also, past president used to stay there.
All great things! No one ever believed North Korea could be solved. All it took was a pair of balls and a man who wrote “The Art of the Deal”.
Strategic patience failed. 
Placating failed. 
Peace came through strength.
Trump's penis/button comparison did nothing to cause this. The collapse/explosion of the North Korea's main nuclear site caused this not Trump.
Here it comes. The left will deny all cr dit to our president. Just STFU. Get out of my country.
Pleasant fellow aren't you... Also America is my country...
Then support it !
I do. Trump is not America...
So open boarders = illegals , free stuff disrespecting police and military ,pedos sex trafficking and ignoring the constitution and  elimenating the middle class is your America .. good luck with that

#MAGA


They are moving ahead without Fat Boy Trump
Pres Moon deserves all the credit. You are just a cheerleader on the sidelines.
You should learn to respect your President.
He deserves the honor of the greatest dealmaker.
This is the United States. Here, we have the constitutional right to publicly express our dissent.
We Same Here.
It is true that President Trump is on the way to settling one of the biggest problems in the world.
Trump hurled a few insults and idle threats at North Koreas leader and now his obsequious sycophants want him to get the Nobel Peace Prize. Lol you can’t make this stuff up. Trump needs to stay out of it or he will screw this up.

Thank you for your respect and honor for my President.
I just checked your profile. Can I have some money?




..now japan is working with US, behind korea.
Great
A REAL Nobel Peace Prize is due.
When are you speaking with a psychologist?
You realize he was elected? Which means at least SOME people support him? Why would you even take the chance to literally alienate possibly half the people who look up to you? Can we not keep opinions to ourselves anymore?
You can't deny that he needs to see a psychologist if he isn't already seeing one
We are closer the denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula than we have ever been, and some people will still say our president can do nothing correct. Open. Your. Eyes.
No he can send the right people over to talk for him but he himself had nothing to do it so...
This is a great time across the world and Nobel Peace Prize worthy. Obama won it then proceeded to drop more bombs than every President combined
Muller is coming for you!
You can't even spell his name correct...stop embarrassing yourself...
So because she supports a 71 who doesn’t always spell right on Twitter and that means she can’t call someone else out for misspelling a name? I don’t understand
*you’re..
Amanpour on PBS, Amanpour: Wendy Sherman explains what denuclearization really means to Kim Jong Un...
Statements by the United States and North Korea suggest that they are not just driving at different goals. They may also be operating in different realities.
I wish I could make this video start at 12:52. The first part is total propaganda BS, the second part is TRUTH!! Skip to 12:52 & WATCH THIS INTERVIEW!

Check out this video from @PBS: Amanpour on PBS, Amanpour: Kang Kyung-wha and Thae Yong-Ho
Working on the job. A good idea has come.
Golf time now? Laziest so-called Prez in history!
Idiot.
You really shouldn't be talking or tweeting just go cheat at golf it's what you do best...
You do know that you are going to jail for the rest of your life, right?

This tweet is surreal considering the tweets it followed. What is going on? This is a joke.
LOL yes, Donald Why are cons so very easy to con? @realDonaldTrump will think he succeeded at the end of the day no matter the result
Negotiations that you have nothing to do with because you are a loser and a weak leader.

Bot
C'mon. You can say it. Trump is winning. #MAGA
Stormy Daniels is winning! 
Now that's funny. Let's see. 
Russian collusion - Fail
Obstruction - Fail
Now stormy - FAIL.
Liberal deflection always comes back to bite themselves in the ass.
Infidelity by a president was best perpetrated by Democrats while IN OFFICE by Clinton and JFK. #MAGA #Winning
Best president ever. As his accomplishments are bearing out. All the things Obama couldn't accomplish and failed at. #MAGA is getting last laugh and are enjoying every second of it and will be for 6½ more years. Triggering crybaby liberals is spectacular 
You’ve embarrassed PM Abe and have no fucking idea of what’s required to successfully carry out international diplomacy. #GrowUpDonald
And now it's time to hit the links. Have a great Saturday working at Wal-Mart, suckers!
And I imagine Prime Minister Abe is freaking out since you never even had the decency or forethought to inform him of your decision to meet with KJU, You Old Fool
Our savior,  our great masterful trump, the only one who can save us. A fearless leader who is selfless and caring. Full of empathy, justice and truth. He and only he can bring us to where we need to be. A masterful negotiater. Bwaaaaaaaa, just kidding!
The man who built his political career on Obama's birth certificate & Hillary Clinton's e-mails now believes he's the victim of a witch hunt

Peace in Korea will be upon you Mr. President. Appreciate that! 
“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves”  Matthew 7:15
Japan be patient. Japanese govt needs 2 help the victims families in Japan what have the govt done in the past for the families. Dont ruin peace between countries when evil misled Japan & Korea tell Japan be patient. Maybe a year let N.Korea clear up things.
Bravo Mr President. Let's keep rolling
트황상 노벨상 드림
Look at you so proud of yourself ... for getting some work done...Kanye says poopi thank you
please remember to caption your images, it makes twitter more accessible!
Here Comes the PEACE. Make great world again~ Thank you sir !
You tweeted 30 mins before. How long and in-depth could it be?
This tweet is rather pathetic. You have run out of STAFFERS to talk to, so you tweet &/or call into FOX TV shows - UNSOLICITATED .... to vent your views.

So, very UN-PRESIDENTIAL**** ... But, then, you are ... SO, VERY, UNPRESIDENTIAL.***
Did you see their faces when Kellyanne said he wanted to call in monthly?????? Priceless!
DONALD J. TRUMP; If it comes off you will have made yourself an excellent President, showing the vision that has taken place. History is another matter and the speed of this peace deal does not seem right? Pressure on KIM JONG-UN a lot to lose. SURPRISE ME!!!
Be safe . Thank u
sure you did!!!
Kim Jong-un will cheat on any agreement. Kim Jong-un has killed his own family members, & he killed one American hostage & is holding 3 Americans & I have not heard you say a word about them no face to face talks with the North Till they are freed. You are being played.
I am so proud of Moon for all of the work he has done on negotiations and peace talks and keeping a calm and rational mind. All while an American baboon takes credit.
The only reason why Kim and Moon are meeting is that both of them have realized that POTUS Trump is the match that will set off the powder keg in Korea.  The time has come for them to unify.  If Trump wants #AmericaFirst, then Yankee, go home.

Yep...
goes with their jock strap LOL
LOL!  
They will go even better if you stay in Iran Nuclear Deal. N.K. will as that U.S. can keep its word.
Great. Another opportunity for you to embarrass America, this time on the international stage.
No substance. No time frame. Better talk to Xi, considering that you have been in business with China for decades. Well, they bail you out.
Possibly. If the translator can understand DJT's dribble

Obama got it for just breathing...At least Trump did something

President Trump did more than Obama in a year than he did in 8 years... Obama double are debt... Bush made dept also but now all of that shit is on Trumps shoulders... Trump has so much money he wouldn't have to do nothing but he cares about America make great again... President

Just had a long and very good talk with President putin. Things are not going so well, time and location of another meeting with russia is being set. Also spoke to putin to inform him of the ongoing (cohen is throwing me under the bus for less prison time) negotiations.
Good one Donny boy. Keep em guessing. Putin’s awesome so is NK leader. And China. All of us sheep can’t wait till you can be #presidentshitforbrains forever
Its pretty funny how you’re trying to make it look like you’re doing work here.
It's so mad that things have gotten do serious that China had no choice but to force Kim to talk with the Donald, bet they wish they had started this during Obama term. Safer and less lightly under Obama to have its detail transmitted via Fox and friends or twitter
I think they all know they can’t trust Trump.
True but don't think China had any choice, I mean the Donald was calling him rocket man, so they probably figured both leaders are nuts so in the interest of world safety best try and get the two talking, terrified of the out come but doing nothing would be a bigger risk.
Very likely.
Wow a conversation between two mentally incompetent leftists. You guys are so cute when you try to talk like real adults.
MikeyDouche, @POTUS happens to be doing an awesome job. As far as goose stepping you little fascists on the left are much better at then anyone on the right could ever be If you you were worth the time I would educate you but you have little brains and just wouldn't understand

464th day of Donald’s reign of terror & no South Korean Ambassador! 

How does Donald blame the Dems for that?
Thank you for keeping us informed President Trump. Our Nation is blessed to have you leading! #KAG #QAnon

You made poopy in the potty??  OMG Good Boy!! Good Boy, Donny!!!!!  OMG OMG OMG YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD BOY, DONNY!!!!!!! 

It’s a trap. I mean... enjoy.
I think maybe Kim will try to poison Trump's food or drink LOL

Hopefully you will get to visit his collapsed nuclear site to evaluate the radiation
You're an outsider on all deals. This bilateral historic moment does not include you. Presidents Moon and Un should be applauded by all leaders.
You should have never become president
#TrumpRussia
good job
Please, Vote & Retweet so we can get many people participating in this critical question!
Any U.S. Presidents central responsibility is to protect the American People from domestic and external threats!
Our  trust to our "Justice System" must be restored!
Should President Trump FIRE ALL the higher management at the DOJ…
This is true progress indeed, Mr President. I just shake my head at the leftists that will refuse to give you any credit for this historic moment.
You have NOTHING to do with what’s happening with the peace process between North and South Korea. 
CON ARTIST! You are not calling the shots in any of this! North Korea, South Korea. China and Japan are calling the shots — and uniting thanks to your vulgar, bigoted arrogance! RESIGN!
You do know that just because you keep trying to insert yourself via @Twitter that you have had ZERO to do with what is happening with South Korea and North Korea...right?   China and Japan have done FAR more than tweet
You don't have anything to do with those http://talks.You  were busy screaming Fire and Fury and calling him Little Rocket Man
The funny thing Is O 45 claims his rants brought results most importantly evevn the press believes this. In reality the South Korean president has been a strong supporter and vocal about his intention on diplomacy and peace with his neighbour.

OMG...now you are trying to make the /Reunification of Korea about YOU....just shaking my head.
Look at me!  Look at me! I'm a bigly president!

Traitor Donnie INVITED Russians & Blocked Out US Media
https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/politics/russians-trump-team-magnitsky-act/index.html …
Taking credit for PEACE in NK WHILE creating WAR in AMERICA?  better check your attacks on the free press,Millions of Americans believe the press is “the enemy of the people.” You’ve convinced them not to trust sources of facts,which removes accountability,check & balances.
Seems like they are doing well without you trying to start another war for profit lol last month you were pushing ww3 n building up missiles on the dmz, The reason there have been peace talks is because you weren't invited lol don't break your arm patting yourself on the back
THIS guy is going to help ??  
  .
And as soon as he hung up, he and his cabinet had a roaring good laugh at your dumbassery.

I do hope there is a transcript and that you had some input before making these calls.  You seem to have problems understanding protocol and other cultures.  #25thAmendment
Hi Butchy !
Why don't you just keep out of it? Just do what you do best: play golf and spread bullshit. #Impeach45 #BlueWave2018
Like anyone needs YOU, trump, to inform them of anything!  Thanks for the laugh!
Thank you for caring enough for the American people to actually talk to us like we have a stake in everything that you do!! Never has a President in my lifetime ever treated the people like we matter!! That you so much Mr. President!! #MAGA #KAG Love to you!! 
Thank you POTUS Trump
Donnie....have you realized that Kim J U has taken you for a ride....he got whatever he craved for....you made a despot into a hero!!!

Just stop wasting our money on these stupid trips..

REP LIEU RELEASES LETTER FROM FORMER DEPUTY COMMANDER OF US FORCES KOREA ON HIS ASSESSMENT OF WAR WITH NORTH KOREA

lol. implying he HAS policy in the first place https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31402526_2136976809880465_1111650214671810560_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=932786a15d70b09981910e1ad92016c9&oe=5B5094B5 … all he as ever done in his LIFE is take credit for others work

Of course i am. Are you saying you DONT get upset watching others get credit for work they didnt do?
Why didn't you get upset the last 8 years then?  You do realize that the President does not EVER do any of the actual "grunt work" none of them ever did.  Are you naive enough to think they do? And again, why does it ONLY upset you now? Biased much?  LOL
Because the last one to claim credit like this was bush jr, with the "mission accomplished" speech. At which, i was just as mad. You arent a mind reader. Dont assume you know what i did or did not do in the past unless you like having yoyr foot in your mouth.
Wow!  You are easy to stir aren't you?  Just a huge bundle of raw nerves.  
Lets assume that true. Your point then is?
I hope Kim and his entourage are not getting an all expense paid vacation to a Trump property courtesy of the US Taxpayer. @madasednam
Trump will be first to build a grand hotel in North Korea. That’s his game. Partners with Kim Jung Un.
So, basically you are a receptionist?


Have your meeting out of our country and don’t come back....ever.
Hi, Mr.Trump.

I think the both North and South Korea are unbelievable countries.
It is the parent Pyongyang group in Korea that is troubling #sexslaves issue.
They are working on separation between Japan and the United States.
#comfortwomen
I remember clearly that those who were recruiting or deceiving Korean women for the military brothels were Korean men. Japanese authorities were arresting those illegal brokers cheating women. Here are some…
You’re not capable of paying attention long enough for even a short conversation. So, we assume this is yet ANOTHER LIE BY THE CRIMINAL in the WH
and the orange Ape has nothing to do with it 
Please resign, be a man, #ResignNow




How’s your good friend puttin.  When’s the last time u spoke with him?
I hope Dr. Candy Man gives you some valium before you meet with Kim Jong-un. He might want to slip some valium in Kim Jong-un's drink as well.
Everything you say is a lie.
Great job Mr. President! Your honesty and openness is best we've seen.

I believe that the North American talks for peace will be successful. President Trump is cheering.
I thank God for you all day long everyday that God gives me breath. America has never looked so bright. It’s like the Tide Pods washed the flag of its brokenness that you fight for 24/7 USA 
Awesome job Mr. President! Thank you for making possible what everyone before you said was impossible! You are one of the greats! The first since Ronald Reagan who deserves the title "Leader of the Free World" because YOU are a LEADER & YOU are making it happen! Love & Respect!
im korean.
i love you.
Great. Don't screw it up
You have the same involvement in Korean peace talks that you had in fighting the war in Vietnam... none. Stop pretending.

If you want to be involved with important historic talks, stop stalling and go talk to Bob Mueller, Fatboy.

Oh, do you speak Korean? Do you speak any language besides elementary school level English? Doubtful you have the brains to learn a language.

Did they give you a big boy job to do? Isn’t that cute...

I Elect @POTUS 45 for Nobel Peace Prize! 
you are so inept. i know you will take credit if anything positive happens so this is a pre-emptive FUCK YOU.
President Moon has been campaigning on ending the war in Korea for a long time. But you are very good at swooping up credit that is not yours. 
If you REALLY wanted to get the best of Obama (lol), fix Flint, Mi. Fix the DXPL that you allowed. And Puerto Rico.
Generally I don't cheer for you, but I pray you knock this one out of the park.  #WorldPeace

@realDonaldTrump is doing what Clinton, Bush, and Obama combined  never could with  North Korea.....#WINNING!

lol no https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31402526_2136976809880465_1111650214671810560_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=932786a15d70b09981910e1ad92016c9&oe=5B5094B5 …
Don't argue with us.  Argue with the North/South Koreans and Chinese representatives who have all publicly (TV and in the press) given Trump credit stating that these meetings would not be taking place if not for him.  They said it - argue with them. LOL
Why? They are just doing what all heads of state need to: appease don the con's fragile ego in order to get real work done amoungst themselves without him trying to sabotage it out of spite.
Took you an entire 5 minutes to dream up that rationalization huh?  LOL
No. I took 4 minutes to make a sandwich. I took 1 to explain how actual leaders are forced to handle the man-baby in chief after reading your response.
Right.  Gotcha!  
Im sorry. I thought you might actually have somthing of substance to say. Not just a 14 year old "lol u mad?"
Then you ate a cheeseburger and thought about those peeing Russian hookers. Productive day.
To make it look like you’ve had something (anything) to do with this.
What things?  How do you define "going" well, Chuckles?  Considering the facts of events this week, I don't think those words mean what you think they mean? Yeah, "facts," you remember what those are don't you? Speaking of facts, we'd like some. Release your tax returns.
维尼大帝呢？
FYI they ALL think you are a DOTARD.
I hope get peace between North and South Korea
Any past president could have met with the North Korean leader. Difference is they demanded something for it first. You agreed to it because you desperately need to look like you’re winning at something. You’re gonna get rolled, pops.
Funny... the kicker is Trump is GETTING something for it... like denuclearization. 

Oh... and it will drive Liberals nuts, but maybe #NobelPeacePrize
“Getting” is future tense. He has gotten nothing so far. Fact.
If you really think North Korea is going listen to the ramblings of a #DOTARD #WAKEUP Kim is savvy he is aligning himself with countries that can help him you’ve alienated yourself from strong allies - we’re #doomed if we continue to turn a blind eye to this mans idiocy!
Took screenshots, just for fun this time.


Lemme guess?  Your gonna take credit for this one too?

Please don’t screw this up! Remember it’s not all about you.
You are INSANE & narcissism has you by the huevos!
膿の安倍晋三はやはり蚊帳の外でしたか！単なる交渉経緯を伝える相手ですね（笑）
Thank you, Mr. President! 

I know I'm early, but Happy Birthday Mr. President! May you live long and prosper. May you succeed in all your endeavors.  With Love,  Lexxy
Told everybody a cloud would come down on North Korea & to sing peace & God's Love before you 2 went barking at each other. Noone believed me just like they didn't when I said you'd win Big! They fear 4 I also said what would happen to the USA since Marcus Penn was murdered here.
tRump is definitely losing his mind.
He knows it and every mentally stable human being knows it too.
THANK-YOU to the prez & his administration for volunteering to make PEACE & prosperity available to& for all. #Trump  & sorry for the few ungrateful, haters.   Your rallies showed/ show the truth.
Thank you for informing us. This fake news won't mention anything..unless its false
Be careful Mr.President i still don't trust Kim
Hey another one of your Trump Towers is on fire
Just called my damn grandma.  Talked about her cat.  I guess everything's ok, we'll see.  Confirmed get together later tonight, will watch tv and eat burgers.  Also, will probably clean bathroom at some point.
It’s bigly yuge that your intervention paid off. All those insulting “Rocket Man” tweets gave the two leaders a common idiot they could laugh at. Together.
ThanQ @POTUS for #MAGA & #KAG I support you 1000% Proud  you are my @POTUS
I’m pretty sure you think he’s the president of the Moon.
President Moon of South Korea needs to win the Nobel Peace Prize if this process does come to fruition. He was so intent on making peace and he is making it happen. What a smart, capable man. He knows how to make deals. — By the way how is Michael Cohen doing?

We really don't need you to update on this. The news covers it better (and uses complete sentences).

All these tweets do is make you look like an insecure fool who wants to take credit where it isn't due.
Who had money on the House Chaplin being fired before Trump? 

@SpeakerRyan must have.

#RyanFiredChaplin
***BREAKING NEWS*** South Korea and North Korea continue to work out a peace deal regardless of US sanctions. China and Russia are eager to help.
Outstanding job moving peace forward, Mr. President!
Kitty  grabber-n-chief,I hope Moon or Abe get the Nobel Peace prize.They have really worked hard at making this meeting happen before you try dumbing it down so you understand what's happening.
Very impressive. Considering everyone was worried about a nuclear attack. Say or feel what you want about Trump... he’s getting things done. MAGA
POTUS tweets "very good talk with President Moon of South Korea". Isn't it an amazing coincidence ... President Moon of South Korea ... and President Moonbeam of the U.S.
The Master of Art of the deal 
WTG Mr President. 
This is a REAL NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER -
I hope everything goes smooth...
Shut the fuck up. For the safety of the world and my sanity. Please.
No Apology Tours for OUR President!

Extreme Negotiation and building relationships with other World leaders!

.@realDonaldTrump was the #Impetus and catalyst for meetings that foreshadow World Peace! Saving our Western Civilization.

Did he tell you how HE met with NK and how HE is brokering this peace deal? Notice you were not involved with this at all.
This is amazing Mr President.  Thank you.
Trying to muscle in on the progress happening between North and South Korea the world is watching you try and take credit for all of it and everyone knows better.
Everyone knows that you have no interest in diplomacy and discussions, and that you couldn’t properly update Abe about negotiations if your life depended on it.  

Self promotion is all you’re interested in.
