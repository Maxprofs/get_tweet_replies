You're very special too. Also so profound! How do you impart such depth within the 140-character limit?

Trump Math! Love it! That’s how he bankrupted casinos multiple times.
you lost!!!
Well, we all lost.
sarcastic applause...
Thanks a lot. Please continue to support the UK. 
ecks dee

Bet your mom said you're special.  Did she have you tested?
What kind of English is that. It looks like a 3rd grader wrote it. Maybe that's the problem.
USA taxpayers are paying for the wall. Your voters never read the fine print and it's all fine print because tiny hands.
you wish your forehead was tiny

Hopefully more special than your puppet master Putin
Poor Theresa May!
please stop all the needless tweets already. MAGA by paying attention to the job at hand.
You will probably be impeached before spring

(T)he (R)ussians (U)se (M)e - (P)athetic

You are a shame upon us all.
what does australia  relationship to the USA mean to you Donald trump and cannot be strengthened any more than what it is

This whole Trump tweet thing Its s joke, right?
Please don't grope her.
your administration will be the equivalent of the orchestra on the Titanic.
That orchestra was heroic and amazing!  I hope you are right!

please, please, please, do not grab her by the pussy.
Why do you keep Putin American lives at risk?
And why are you Russian to that conclusion?
I was Stalin a little on my replies
your account would be nothing without Trump, the only attention you get is from bashing Trump.
Your account wouldn't exist without Trump since this is a tribute account so I guess we are even Stevens.
we will see who cries
"I look very much forward......" 
Where the hell did U learn to speak English??
Trump University??

You have to be real delusional to think Obama acted like a clown. Effing crazy.

Dopnt send me Fox Fake news crap u bald lunatic in a clown red jecket
Fake? Every one of those is a proven fact. Even your precious CNN will tell you.

Wikileaks has a 100% track record, and they said Russians aren't their source.
Why do we have to live in fear of your deranged personality and rhetoric, scary times.....

Sorry, but what on earth are you talking about? Khan elected by Londoners. Also, he was elected Mayor b4 May became PM.
I don't think she has done her research on British politics...
That's evident.
Oh, and I'm blocked. Great exchange @Margi1959
oh you lucky thing! She advised me to stop talking to morons so I happily obliged with her!
Delighted to meet a fellow 'm' :)
and traitors to England apparently!
Speaking of international relations, I think you need to ask Mexico why they aren't going to pay for your fucken wall.
the longer you delay investigating Russia, the bigger the DISGRACEFUL stain on your presidency. #Amerussia #Ω
Stop spamming. 
Can't believe they changed the Hollywood sign again!
Can you believe they changed the Hollywood sign again? 
TOO GOOD AHAHAHA
Tired of winning yet?  I'm not...
no because when i win, i do it legitimately. have fun with your phony tangerine shitlord who panders to russia
"she puts out" LOL even if i did, nice sexism. congrats for advertising yourself as a shitty person. bye 
and you're a walking dick! get a life and stop attacking people on the internet
@little_pengelly surprised you felt this was worth sharing Emma
Clearly nothing better to do!! Although there's something niggling at the back of my mind..
Would you please ask her to get on with Brexit. Nobody here can get her to do the job we pay her to do!
I know. Let's give her to 30.3 to trigger like she has promised. If the process hasn't started by then, will be raging
got to go through parliament first, boys 
I'm relaxed. They won't dare block.
but will filibuster. Your march timeline is unrealistic.
Any blatant obstruction will be noted and remembered by the voting public.
as will this lack of backbone constructively leading this country to inconsequentially.
What lack of backbone? We're leaving EU - every bit of it. But want best deal that's both in our interest & EU's
did you have to wikipedia whether the u.k. was an ally or not
he knows what NATO is and every country in NATO is allied with each other. Britan and the USA are in NATO
and yet he doesn’t know that we are treaty-bound to defend NATO lol
he also stated that since the ussr collapsed a defensive treaty is not necessary because NATO was formed against SU
or nato is a good buffer and defensive position against russian hegemony in the area.
well no not really the threat of the ussr is no more. And the people of Crimea wanted to be with Russia.
lol get back to work, comrade
glad to see that you can't come up with a counter argument
she needs to start thinking like Trump and protecting her people
all Trump wants to donos fill his pockets, doesn't give a fuck about anyone else, self-centered
My entire country thinks you're a joke
Thank you so much.  Awesome President!
sounds creepy drunk uncle when you say it
Then start treating this ally with diplomatic respect.
The Britain I live in is no ally of yours, sod off!
God your grammar is truly awful.
I wish more tweets were pleasant like this one
why is she going to pee on you too?

@RebecaSantosR #Trumpass is a liar, liar hair on fire.
"I look very much forward..."? Are you trying to sound stupid?
Good luck, you're doing a great job.
It's you that's special and you need treatment for it!!!! In a padded cell preferably.....
I hope you're booed out of the country.
Pls- May should rethink her being prepared to launch a nuclear attack at her will! Diplomacy? Good for World Peace? NOT!
I'm sure she'll be thrilled to meet you; NOT!!!
Why, so you can complain about windmills near your lousy golf courses?
didn't we ban you from Britain?
The British hate you.  Actually tried to ban you from the country.
"Let me know if you're in town." Typical invite for a State visit. Better get cracking, instead of insulting Meryl Streep.
please don't talk. Just smile that stupid smile and don't talk. Let her read your heart
PLEASE DO NOT MEET THE POPE! VATICAN IS BEHIND ALL THINGS EVIL. I PROMISE YOU. WE HAVE SPENT LIFETIMES RESEARCHING THIS.
You're very special too @realDonaldTrump ! @PutinRF_Eng told you so, didn't he? #PutinsPoodle  #TraitorTrump #hillarywonthepopularvote #sad

calm down, she won't let you grab her by the pussy.
.@realDonaldTrump Ask someone to help you with your grammar. If we are only going to hear from you via Twitter, at least be intelligible.
Pretty sure he campaigned against Grammatical Correctness, too.
Theresa May is no Maggie Thatcher..just sayin'
looking forward to your review of her from a 1 to 10
Got a pocket full of tic-tacs?
Gonna try to kiss her against her will?
we are sure you will alienate them soon with your lack of presidential insight.
lets follow britain on imigration.thay only take professtionals like doc, scientist, researhers.. charge $10,000 entry fee
too bad she is not an ally of Israel!!
'britain is very special' jesus fucking christ read a book 
Learn some new fucking words
@dvdhth David.
shame you think it's acceptable to have your SIL deal with our Foreign minister. Shame on you. #impeach
UK doesn't hold a candle to Russia in your mind.
Excellent. #MAGA
And Britain knows how to treat their citizens..Healthcare, and womens reproductive rights.!! Take a leaf out of her book!!
take away the millions of dollars the United States gives to Mexico every year to pay for the wall!
oil is up , dollar steadying , Donald Trump is working his magic .. good job !
if things go on like that on a steady gradual course , I will be in US to bring jobs to US workers, just timing that's all
US labour is a sophisticated workforce , quick and sharp only problem is demanding, strikes , but we can work around that
have you watched the movie 'Norma Rae' featuring Sally Fields ?
That's a possibility
watch your back.
I think that man has reached such success in business,won the election,thought out strategy in relations with Russia
Nice English and use of grammar....NOT!!
: Dear The Donald, please think of ruling with compassion for citizens, & protection of our future & present. Can Udo that?
Britain wants nothing to do with you, you cock-womble
@joe_warmington the best thing Britain ever lost? the battle against the Yanks. What a mess of a place 
You were two days late with your own news ... British press reported this on Thursday.
was that a lul Donald ?
"I look very much forward..."?  I don't thought your grammar was corrective in advance to tweet before then... you holeass!
I hope you don't grope her.
Would you invite Marine Le Pen @MLP_officiel, french Front National leader at your inauguration ceremony 20th january?
who cares who you meet  PUPPET.. you will just disresect them anyway
@LorenceHud you know @theresa_may is Saudi-Qatar$ Corrupted with @KingSalman Bombing Murdering Yemen none stop.

Hope you don't grab her inappropriately! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wM248Wo54U …
too bad they banned you from the country before
You can stop in my spare room Donald if you come to the UK. I also have old Golf clubs you may use.
Do not grab her by the pussy for the love of god!
We're all hoping you'll be impeached by then. Now THAT would be special!
yawn to your Tweets. Just a distraction from the real issues, incomplete vetting of your cabinet choices, for example.
You should not meet with anyone.  You are an embarrassment to America and not qualified to lead our nation.  Resign now!
And u disgrace them along with US with ur belligerence and dillusional twitter rants. Ur an embarrassment, fueled by fools!
"special" sums you up Mr.  Trump.
She's ok, Donald, but watch her. She is no keen on following her peoples' will on Brexit. Beware of her.
Mr Trump, my first tweet ever. Thank you so much for coming to the rescue of our country. An answered prayer Thank you God
Although, you know.  Not special enough to pick up the phone to for hours and hours after your rigged election...
You couldn't meet her in a big hole somewhere, could you? Just a thought.
a few months back you said the UK didn't matter. Liar liar liar
will you be grabbing her by the pussy ?
Seriously?
Try not to fuck it up.
-By the way slutty May has been confused with a prostitute who has same name with different spelling as you recall
Keep your kids at home. She's not a very nice person.
so, so special!  Awww.....    I'm very proud of you!
also home of the best links course in the world #trumpinternational.
can you please make @directvnow sufficient? Not even looking for great I just want it to work! Stole my money and no TV!
look out Theresa, he might grab your lady bits
Your Dad is Going to Prove to Be A Great President I Love Him and all of His Family
I see you've been catching up on your "Foreign Relations for Dummies". Great job!!!
I think Britain and Germany and France will welcome you with open arms and will be impressed with your leadership.
GoPresident Elect Trump! Ask for the BUST back that Marxist Obama gave back to Queen Elizabeth. Unbelievable !
the grammar. Please go back to college and learn to write. Also pick up a book and learn something already.
bet she isn't feeling the same way
Next time from #France  will be a #Frexit President U will meet in #Washington 
@IvankaTrump @TrumpFrance @PrisonPlanet
Better do your homework this time and not make a damn fool out of yourself like you did in Ireland
I think trumps AG will do a much better job up holding the laws than any of obamas flunkies what a joke from these democrat
Take them to the bank over a barrel
Are they more special than our Russian ally? When is your next party with Putin? I bet that guy can party! Fill us in later
I have it on good authority that @TheresaMay_MP loves having her pussy grabbed......and she's married.....win win 
Grammar is certainly not your strong suit. or, so you can understand ... certainly strong suit not is your grammar.
Well, button your suit coat.  It will look more Presidential.
I'm pretty sure someone with an IQ of 156 would have not butchered English language like this. Just saying.
Oh, I bet she can't wait either.  She has laughed about you in numerous public venues. You are a joke!
Will you grab her by the p*ssy? In the locker room does Putin slip you his kielbasa?
and they dread our being in charge. #NobodyRespectsTrump
One trusts you can resist the temptation to grab her by anywhere inappropriate.
you will have killed the USA long before may.
until they disagree with you..
we are fucked  
@theresa_may Why do I feel like my entire country was just sexually assaulted? Grabbed by the pussy as it were.
Mr Trump to comments of Golden Globes ignore them, they are only bleeding by the wound...haha!
You know you are banned in Scotland till you stop being racist but we love some of what you are doing @realDonaldTrump
@rustyrockets Looking forward to meeting you in May while your still 42
Bullshit!
Literally no one in the UK thinks that Donald trump as president is a good idea or respects him in that role. It's sadly laughable...

Sir with Respect, this country need to be United with other countries to have piece...all over the world...
