Wow!
You offered this last year for little #CharlieGard . Please step in and try to help #AlfieEvans now.
Christians are not medical experts, they aren't experts in rational thinking seen as they believe in zombies rising from the dead, virgins giving birth & praying to someone who they have no evidence is listening & believing he talks back.

"Ariana Huffington is unattractive. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man - he made a good decision"


Sorry, last I heard, #CharlieGard died. So sad when politics and $$$ are more important than a life!
If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so....
Best thing you can do to help everyone is resign you racist crook
Please stop making a fool out of yourself. Run your words past the Generals before you speak about any topic at all.

PRAYERS TO CHRIS GARD, CONNIE YATES AND THEIR BEAUTIFUL BABY CHARLIE GARD WHO WILL WATCH OVER THEIR SHOULDERS FROM HEAVEN!
SHAME ON THE BRITISH LAW, HOSPITAL & HOSPICE. DESPICABLE! PRAYERS TO CONNIE YATES, CHRIS GARD $&THEIR BEAUTIFUL BABY! CHARLIE GARD=IMMORTAL!

You never wonder that doctors do not know everything. How dare a despicable hospital decides for the parents? In what world you live in?
Yes you gave false hope to a grieving family whose child couldn't breathe without aid of machine.Try helping women support Planned Parenting
The gov't shouldn't have been able to sentence this child's death
The terrible heavy handedness of hospitals and non family members, especially governments and grant suckers must be hand tied .
In the UK
Did you do anything, or was the tweet plenty?

NOTHING you could do!
Trump administration has made healthcare dysfunctional, only providing healthcare to people if they are rich.  Sad.
Delighted baby sleeping bless his cotton socks .Sleep was his best medicine not all the stpid interaction Dr knows best
Poor Charlie Gard. This is what Govt. "Single Payer", the (D) version of "Death Panels". #RepealAndReplaceObamacare
Little #CharlieGard died a couple of hrs ago. Spend sometime thinking of the 11 month old baby and his devastated parents
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.S.A and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so.
@connie85yates Thank You.
not with our healthcare system
at least not after this week
But screw most Americans by stripping their Health Care. Sure ...
What about the millions of American children who are fighting cancer and other diseases but face losing their healthcare?
Are you for expensive medical procedures or against them? I'm lost! What if this child is transgender?! Or poor?!
My 2 #babies past away in US, the same #CharlieGard condition. THANKS @POTUS for offer dignity&compassion to that family. GodBlessU, a Mom.
You are no "friend" of the Pope's.  Stop meddling, step down, and let someone else "lead" our country.  U r incapable
Would be a good idea if President Trump would take Charlie & adopt the baby ,since Parents lost their legal  ability
Dearest President Trump, please tell me that Charlie's parents will be able to leavea country that murdered their son...?!?
And you Sir, are so uninformed as to this childs disease what's your agenda.
This is a medical ethics case and should not be used as a political tool.
save charlie now mr president
Amazing how you would help this family, YET, you DENY millions of the ACA who depend on it for their LIVES!
WHAT ABOUT ALL THEM PEOPLE IN UNITED STATES  YOU WILL TAKE OBAMA CARE AWAY FROM .. YOU AN HELP A BABY IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY BUT NOT YOUR OWN
They are trying to use that baby to milk the insurance rates of government the doctors are crooks!
.@realDonaldTrump #Hypocrite! The mean #Trumpcare bill coming up for a vote would devastate US kids to give huge tax cuts to rich people.
Does White House have letterhead anymore? Is there still official state communication be countries anymore or is it all just Twitter now?
while I'm sorry for Charlie, you do not care about your own people and want to take their health insurance away. Hypocrite!

NIKS UNDER GOSH,RAISES MONEY SUPPORTS IT LOVES THE KIDS. HES SAYING CHARLIES MIRACLE WIL HAPPEN.NIK WNTS HIM IN USA
You could, guarantee single payer health care on behalf of "Little Charlie Gard".  That would be magnanimous.  Or bigly good.
Shut up and get to work!!!
The little boy can't die, please can you try to get #CharlieGard over to USA because we all know that he can survive.
I would like to help out at anyway I can Mr president trump.
I think it's great if he can be cured. But if he can not & has to remain on ventilators, who will be paying the hefty bills? America or UK?
Do what is 'morally' right.  Also, pivot your attn 2 the epidemic of #ChildSexualAbuse could ya? @Pontifex has failed re these crimes IMO
@POTUS refuses to take care of Americans Pledges to remove over 32,000,000 from healthcare to die @realDonaldTrump is more loyal to PUTIN
Talk about cost. Do you have any idea how much $ it's going to take to care for this ONE child? Who is paying?
How can you reach out to this kid to provide healthcare but want to kick millions of Americans off healthcare?

Well sed sir
Pres.Trump call Teresa May & make a deal for Charlie Gard to get to America.DISPICABLE that parents don't control of their children's health
: AMEN!!  WE PRAY FOR YOU ALL EVERYDAY. HEAVENLY WISDOM AND GUIDANCE AND PROTECTION IN JESUS 
MIGHTY NAME!!
help Charlie but fuck the American children, elderly, sick with your "healthcare bill" and you seem delighted to do so.
Quit lying, u don't have the time between MarLago & Twitter & rubbing elbows w/the Russian govt
Quit lying, u don't have the time brown MarLago & Twitter
I have it on good authority that we could help thousands like Charlie who just might happen to be from Syria instead of the UK.
@chucktodd @seanhannity Chucky, you're not/never have/will have the #finesse#integrity #magnetism or journalistic ability of Sir Tim Russert
Thank you, dear President Trump for helping this little boy ! His parents love him dearly--he is an innocent baby!

Thanks for all
Will @realDonaldTrump pay for Charlies treatment?  #LetTrumpPay4CharlieGardCare
U going to offer this level of experimental carer 4 all children in OUR country?  As a nurse,does new plan cover little Charlie's treatment?
チャーリーガードちゃんを助けてあげたい気持ちは同じですねー
"If we can help little #CharlieGard ... we would be delighted to do so." As long as his parents can pay. Otherwise fuck him.
I agree!
I am appalled by u getting involved with this, using a baby 2 politicise, will u ever learn what real humility is? Pls don't come to the uk!
Praying the little fellow gets help; hospital should be ashame.this little guy deserves a chance.thanks President Trump for wanting to help.
How about helping your own poor and needy too?
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20 …  highlight the commandments you've broken...this week
Yes don't care
Might could do the same for lots of babies, even from Syria.
How about you help all the kids here that are in danger from trumpcare?
Thank you America!
Hey @SarahHuckabee! Do you ever talk to @potus? Every answer you give, you say "I haven't spoken to the President". Are u kidding?
So I hear trump doesn't think your pretty enough to be on camera. Typical trump
How nice you care about Charlie Gard and are WILLING TO STRIP HEALTHCARE from MILLIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN RIGHT HERE #SaveACA #NOTrumpcare
Hey!
We need ASAP US citizenship to Charlie Gard. Today. No matter how.
They want to kill him tomorrow! 
Please warn Trump,Senate,House.Tks!

37.1K retwets, 123K LIKES...Out of approximately 7 billion people...REALLY? What happen to people's enthusiasm?
Maybe if we were to offer the fake headliner "RUSSIANS HOLD BABY CHARLIE'S LIFE HOSTAGE" that would get left side involve in saving a child.
We have 7 billion people surely we have 100 million God loving people who will sign his petition towards RESOLUTION!
Little Charlie Gard has more than 10% of HOPE as all things ARE possible with/under GOD, science and the love from people !!!

UR willing to help a sweet white UK baby but also willing to sentence to death Syrian children who need medical care in the US? Shameful.
100% agree.
You realize babies are dying in USA because you guys have insurance compNies by ballsack? FIX ACA!!!
Alasdair Seton-Marsden friend of Connie Yates and Chris Gard parents of #CharlieGard on @foxandfriends said @realDonaldTrump @POTUS helped!

"Stop it ,in the name of God".....cardinal Caffarra

In trying to pick tonight's "America's Fakest Christian" Jesus and I became overwhelmed and decided to just give it to a Huckabee again. 
The Pope despises you/ pay attention to Americans
#Heartbreaking: Sign The Petition for #CharlieGard #ParentsRights
Would you be delighted to pay my medical bills from my last trip to the ER?
HELL YEAH, bring #CharlieGard  to the USA!!! We don't have a ban on innocent children who needing the miracles of GOD/Science & LOVE !!!
I wonder whether you and your so called president would think the same if little Charlie's parents were Muslim
WE were CRYSTAL clear. NO MATTER who or what Charlie is or isnt. He is GOD child, and we MUST try ALL avenues as our OATH to our children!!!
Who would we all be of many people of many nations that we CANNOT make efforts towards the miracles of GOD/Science available to our children
I STAND behind President Trump 1000%. Beside little Charlie Gard has more much more than 10% of HOPE as all things ARE possible with GOD !!!
So you have empathy with little Charlie, but NOT with YOUR OWN PEOPLE!  #TrumpCare
But you want to take insurance from millions of Americans. You'd let them die.
Why aren't @GOP & @POTUS  more concerned about giving ALL AMERICANS same Health Care Coverage as UK instead of ONE UK child.  STEP UP!!!
Liar. You only think of yourself. Stop, resign, hide, now, or go to jail, your choice, and Sarah, he will bring you down too.
That would be Obamacare helping under TRUMPCARE that baby gets no help
Help a foreign national but screw 22 million US citizens with mean #Trumpcare bill that is a tax cut for rich people, not healthcare.
My son is 22 1/2 yrs old he has mitrochondial  deleations, rrm2b. And he is still alive &kicking.  Save #CharlieGard
Please contact @charliesfight @Fight4Charlie in regards possible evidence via webcam in court. @BobbySSchindler @cateici #CharlieGard


will this be before or after you strip healthcare from several million American citizens? just curious.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Your son is a traitor! #LockHimUp
This is really about a parents right to choose what happens with their child! This is what will happen with single payer health care. NO
Please President Trump, you must call @Theresa_May & tell them US can't trust UK if it kills it's most vulnerable citizens #CharlieGard
Please President Trump help poor #CharlieGard!
I live the pope and they love me
Now you""re the real President!
To deprive a innocent baby of the right to live is to judge the death penalty, a country that can sentence the innocent to death.
Says the guy that likes to make fun of people with disabilities
Sorry Sarah - your words are as meaningless as Trumps.
Take some time to read the court judgements. This decision was not taken lightly  https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gosh-v-yates-and-gard-20170411-1.pdf …  and  https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/charlie-gard-190617.pdf …
Bring him home on A F1 with you
and be careful with those popes, I hear only bad things about them and have not seen evidence of their good, only worship from others.
Mmmmmmmm.. best leave it to the doctors maybe ? Then again , can I be you for a day ?
Don't listen to a bunch of doctors like a real idiot.
