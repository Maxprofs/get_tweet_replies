LOL you list 10, why not list what he HAS done? You love to spin things to meet your agenda.
Hi Leo! What HAS he done?
Seriously? You cant list that in 140 characters or less.
Multi-tweet it! We've got lots of time!
You may, but i have a life outside of Twitter.
So you can't list any of 45's accomplishments in the first 100 days - because there actually aren't any. Sad.
What's sad is YOU arr too lazy to use Google. If you honestly think he hasnt accomplished anything therrs no helping you. #LostCause
@NYT FAKE FAKE VERY FAKE FAILED NEWS
Fake blondes should not use CAPS and repeat unless you are willing to apologize for the black roots picture like the NYT did for Trump okay?
Proud of my colored hair because I was bald 10 yrs ago battling breast cancer undergoing intense chemo so u shouldn't insult
And the NYT IS FAKE NEWS!
They didn't win 133 Pulitzer prizes for journalism for being fake& if you are literate you would understand that! Our POTUS is not literate!
Kenneth, this is one example of why many ppl find it increasingly hard toTrust them.

NYT Apologizes For Fake News
Apologizes for anything even when caught lying or cheating!I misquoted Pulitzers IT was 122 not 133&I apologize!IS my credibility shot NOW?!
Lol, no, Sir. There was no deception in your intent. But we should all keep an eye on them and other MSMs to keep them all honest.
Agreed? 
So when are you going to apologize for all of the provably false things you've said?
Like for real, this is what real, not fake, journalists do.
Not sure what you mean
Also I tend to avoid ones like Brietbard, as they publish things like, '10 reasons why women are bad at math'/
An article I know to be provably false, having met many women who are exceptional at math.
Glad you're still taking care of the important things in the country. You know like your ego......
Economic conference at 17 year hi. Watching progressive liberalism die is a wonderful sight to see
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst NYT real intent is to criticize 1st with negative attitude against President Trump
Who cares!?! The world is on the brink of mass destruction, and Trump is worried about how big his turn out is
Keep winning Mr President, America hating bots and NYT are slow dying losers
Only thing missing from photo was some tumbleweed.
Only thing missing from your tweet was the truth snowflake
Nice to see this is the first thing on the presidents mind in the morning. You are a sad lil fella @realDonaldTrump
"Never mind all the international shit going on, let's make sure everyone knows my crowd size. I AM IMPORTANT!!"
What does that even mean?
It comes from "cuckold", where another man sleeps with his wife. Idea is he is less of a man because couldn't hold onto woman. Now its...
I more meant the "replacement of whites" part.
Oh oops sorry, that is straight up xenophobia where white are perceived to be pushed out of power by non-white immigrants.
 you are real  a peach

Right.
He apologized before you even tweeted your stupid "Failing NY Times" tweet.
You are an embarrassment to this country.

You are the best President ever. Those that don't like you should go to college because they are obviously uneducated
There are so many things to care about. How many people coming to your party shouldn't be one. You're the WORST president ever. So stupid 
I'm pretty sure Nixon was the worst.
Stick around.
Yes, some people and organizations apologize from time-to-time, you low-life worm. You should try it.
Focus on your job please
LOL: Misleading maybe-easy to believe&not misleading that Tom Brady was a no show! I'm still be reading it everyday @nytimes #notfailing
That's more than @45th_scrotus @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  has ever done
It must be true. Either Steve Bannon or Jared Kiser must be President. All Trump seems interested in is LYING on twitter. All day long.
When will you apologize for all the false things you say. You lie all the time.
"The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years."
"Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing."
You asked for lies, are these true?
Also the birther bs, 44 tapping his phones, that he'd release his taxes...
OMG grow up

Left is whining early this Friday. Trump's not getting impeached he's getting reelected. Now Hillary getting convicted is another story
#TrumpRussia
Yea like the fake dossier that got the fake FISA that allowed Obama to spy on Trump. RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA!  you snowflakes are melting.
Ma'am,  you have no clue. Take your 21 followers and sit down.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst did you see how quickly and openly they apologised?
The major point in all of this is a once respected news source once again knowingly put out a BS smear piece to serve an agenda. It's sad.
Over preoccupation with crowd sizes, approval ratings and what others think of you only reveal deep insecurity, immaturity and pettiness
@realDonaldTrump never apologizes for lying about everything, including his role in #TrumpRussia treason
If NYT appoligized, why did Trump attach a Fox story to his Tweet instead of the NYT apology? 
Because Trump and Fox are wrong.
Who cares?!? NYT is on the same level as The Nat'l Enquirer.
Get a life 45 & grow up babe, Age 70 is surely the time to become a big boy

@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst


Nazis at work.
They should apologize for trying to be a legitimate news source
2009 Over 50 players attended 2017 32% fewe players attended. Just like the inauguration smaller crowds. Liar in chief reposts lying fox 
Butthurt libs crying about crowd sizes.
You lost, time to grow up and get over it.

Sure. They are generally lefttards like the idiot I first tweeted to.
You can carry on now.
Not a bad response from tRumptard, but it was aimed squarely at you.
And I answered the question, you make the 3rd leftist I thought was a Dick head today.
Who gives a damn?

Investigate trump's connections to Russia
We have. There is nothing there
No, they haven't been investigated. Keep up.
It's ok to watch other news sources. And if they haven't been then there is nothing there. Get some tissues
So is the Hillary
RT @foxandfriends: NYT editor apologizes for misleading tweet about New England Patriots' visit to the White House (via ...
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst


The reputation of NYT has gone to the toilet.
Did the FAILING Trump apologize to @BarackObama 4 the FALSE #wiretapping allegations? Or the birth certificate? Of course NOT! #trumprussia
50 players showed up in 2015 34 in 2017.  You do realize 50 is a bigger number than 34?  So once again you lose Obama wins
Just do believe he won lol. He's the President. I laugh all day at you losers.....lol
AMEN
It's so petty anyway why didn't it get reported as a visit instead of a comparison to previous visits
Why don't you ask the NYT?  They're so unbelievably pretty that they can't resist tweeting about ridiculous crap like this!!
I can't wait for your next tweet. Your petulant (that means immature) rants are so hilarious, orange shit-stain. 
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst https://twitter.com/polNewsNet/status/855438887732248576 …
NYT = 1,000,000,000 / 
NYT - Shame on you!!!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst
@f8scruel @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst Obama needed al the Brown noiseing he could get
Haha. Why oh why are all Trump supporters illiterate??? Brown "noiseing?" Do you really think that's the word or even A WORD?
Trump supporters are ALL illiterate because we live in a world of generalization it's the reason libs are ALL spellchecking trolls
Sick of fake news...apologies- fake news...apologies!  Stop it already!
What was the point of comparing photos of NEPats by @nytimes sports writer. Showing how childish the paper has become w/left wing propaganda
And why did trump respond to it if it was childish?
He didn't the New England Patriots did
He retweeted a Fox & Friends video about it.
He showed how child-like it was showing it to more ppl. I thought it was ridiculous. The end
Yes I agree, it was childish showing it to more people and it was ridiculous wasting more time on the subject.  Like we are? Good day.
please mr trump can you stop subjecting us to fox nonsense? We dont believe anything they say.
It is your right. It is also your right not to follow neither his nor Fox's twitter feeds
It's not matter of what we do. It's matter of what he does.
I disagree. It is both
Trump is no longer a private citizen. He gave that up. It's well beyond the time he should have started holding himself to a higher standard
It remains a two way traffic. If the statement made by Madonna was said on Obama she would have been behind bars
Lol nah. Also, how about when Trump openly encouraged violence against Hillary by "2nd amendment people"? Or his 5th Ave shooting claim?
He is the sitting president, nobody who threatens the life of a president should be left to walk
Don't you have any big-boy president things to worry about?
Would you rather him start a needles war like @BarackObama ?
OMG! Who gives a shit?!?!?
A lot of people judging by the comments.
This should be the LAST thing on the president's mind! It's meaningless!
I think the important thing is that any little thing is picked apart for negative press.  It's sickening.  He has a right to be offended.
This why #fakenews is a topic today. Most don't trust or believe the biased media.
NYT all should be fired!! All Liars!!
 oh my Gosh! Is there anybody out there? #impeachTrumpnow #RepealANDReplaceDonaldTrump #MakeUSAintelligentagain
Trump lied more then all media outlets but he is always trying to be better then Obama and he will never be
@America_Lives1 @FoxFriendsFirst Not good enough,he should be fired! They only apologize when caught.
The Patriots who refused to attend (about 30%) are the REAL PATRIOTS! We all stand behind them 100%. You are a deflated ball of shite!
Who cares? It's a photo opp. Nobody got better insurance or a raise in their pay because of this. Your priorities stink.  All ego and boasts
At least he admits it when he screws up.
There is no debating that multiple players boycotted the visit in protest. That is the real story. if you were interested in real news.
yeah, except the haters don't care about the apology. They'll just see what they want to see. Will these people ever learn? No.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst ur ego is so fragile you'd waste time & energy on this. Don't u have 2 host 2 kid rock?
@nytimes Just so petty they are like little kids with all this!
Fox is fake news king!!
Nice to see an apology when a serious error has been made. @realDonaldTrump we would appreiciate if you gave it a try.
Fox News is real news
At least owning up they bad tweets, good for them. NYT take it easy,  that was then, this is now, support this WH, we are all Americans
Media has a big mind
More propaganda #fakenews from @nytimes. The left keep asking "how did we lose?" Ivanka & Jared are next to be president! Crack on! Love it!
Yea they both used to be Democrats like Donald&IT looks like they are pushing out Bannon IN favor of globalist neocons so much for populism!
So, you see exactly what it looks like to admit your mistake and apologize. Better than doing more damage with cover ups & distractions.
The difference here is that NYT recognized the error and corrected it.  You never do even when you are demonstrably WRONG!
#Idiocracy
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst 45 is such a baby. What POTUS cries about stuff like this???

And this means what in connecting to 45 being sad about football???
Ooohhh, when you say "cry", you mean challenging the bias media....Again....Constantly? Ok. Gotcha.
What are you even talking about?
The NYT is a Lobbyist for Progressive Liberal's!!! They should STOP PRETENDING and JUST ADMIT IT!!!!!
This crowd size obsession you have only proves to the world you are overcompensating for having a small genitalia #YuglySad #TrumpsTinyPepi
Maybe you should fact check before you get so excited to smear the man  #MAGA
Maybe DT should fact check before HE lies about people on Twitter or a speech!Nobody lies more than DT! But at least they apologize not him!
How's Bill?
No American president should be the leader of the free world ,that's just a globalist wet dream.
It's not in the constitution anywhere.
#FOXsaveDonaldTrump #
Really, @nytimes apologize 4 a story? THEY'VE DAMAGED THEIR REPUTATION BEYOND REPAIR. I don't even stop 2 read. I have my own OPINIONS!
Fake News Strikes Again Nothing New Here
Only one problem with the Fox story: almost half the players didn't show up for Trump. Wonder why Fox didn't report that?
a very nice apology. You wouldn't understand that because you never apologize though, right?
What about the fact that some players refused to attend because @realDonaldTrump is a complete embarrassment to your country?
So you are claiming that was the largest crowd of New England patriots to ever visit the WH? I heard 30% didn't come. Oh & WHERE WAS BRADY??
President Trumps Inauguration Photographs.The Media put up photos 3-4 Hours before Inaug? CNN backtracked & eventually posted real pictures
Law and order media slander is a serious crime
Still snowing CNN 
Of course This is important to you. Size always matters Mr Small hands. Get something done. Anything! Anything's but golfing.
deliberately misleading or blinded by bias?  Either way @nytimes cannot be trusted.
Oh so sweet.
You're supporters are more that u didn't give afford health or hilary jailed or now assange is no good or corruption & awful CIA tweet that
GET OVER IT
The NY T apologies should fill the entire paper!
Dude, have you nothing better to do than worry about this?
Too bad nobody cares.  Too bad the turnout was so lousy for you.  Maybe next time.
Meanwhile, @FoxNews apologized for its ridiculous sexism.
Lol, really important stuff here, while the world is falling apart
@nytimes Only apologizes bc they got caught. It doesn't count. If they could have gotten away with it they would
Who cares about the Patriots photo?Maybe N Korea China Syria Afghanistan Russia or Europe are more important!Petty childish behavior 4 pres!
@nytimes is bigly supporting @realDonaldTrump for 2020 re-election for @POTUS!
Their stupidity is boundless.
Truly I don't fucking care.
lmao!!!!
No need to we're used to it
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst you lie constantly abt attendence at your events. You've caused media to bait you. Sad.
Donald, you're proving once again that your tiny hands are not the only thing that's tiny! Please just resign and make America great again!
Not really a big lie. More of a pithy quip.
JUST LEAVE DONALD TRUMP ALONE .
Bernstein.
@nytimes You & nearly everyone at 'NY slimes' are 'idiots' and spit out VERY, VERY FAKE NEWS daily. @Acosta @cnnpolitics @CNN takes NO blame
Lmao apples and oranges..You are the orange!
Now that is Collusion.All of media and newspapers seem to be biased.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst When can we expect all the apologies you need to make.#resist #ResistTrump
Wow another small act from a small person I guess
 @realDonaldTrump is such a baby. He can't handle the fact that people just don't like him. THANK YOU @NYTSports for ur accurate tweet.
Really Fox, stop backing Trump. Let the coward suck on his own, stop making yourself look worse.
Apparently didn't even notice what the tweet really said hahahahahahahaha
Fine...we'll give you this one...but, you lie sooooo much! We still don't like you though...you know, because all of your other lies.
NYT lies about a sports team. Trump lies about #Syria #Russia #NorthKores #Medicare, etc... Lucky @FoxNews is there!
I can't believe this mattered enough to you to retweet. You're the president of the United States, how can you care about this?
You still care about this 
Amazing how that guy APOLOGIZED for a dumb tweet. Our President doesn't apologize no matter how many times he is caught LYING!
Lmao Petty shit you Trumpsters need your ego stroked. 
It is the mission of the NYT to discredit our President. So much so that they won't follow through to get ALL THE FACTS.
.@realDonaldTrump Big deal! Who CARES?! At least he owned his mistake & YOU never do. Go watch more TV - you obviously DON'T read or work!
So now you know what a apology looks like. You should try it sometime!
You mislead. Bamboozle & lie.

The Patriots did not look happy to be there & there was a huge difference in number of players. Hush up.
Comparing Trump to a Human is like comparing Orange Tanner to an Apple
I hope you get your dollars worth of Trump, and I hope people burn your plutocratic media empire to the ground.
kudos to the reporter for fessing up, almost unheard of today.
As Hillary once said in the 1990s, I see a pattern/Vast Left wing conspiracy
And your point is? NYT's apologized. There were still less players.
Trump still calls them "Failing" at every mention, even tho sub's are up
They should just close.  Save the trees.  Shutdown in the name of global warming
Thank god. Now we can start focusing on less important things like health care N.korea. Syria. Your Russian ties.
Go trump and Pence making America great again.
You still got a blank helmet. And many players didn't go. Focus on your JOB.
Guess he got scared and he pulled his twitter account. Enough is enough with the lying MSM! #fakenews
If only you would own up to your own misleading tweet too, eh???
I haven't seen soo many retractions from msm since trump entered politics
Whatever all this media propaganda is doing axactly what they said they would do try to take down Trump with lies and brainwash all those 
What is the nyt? Is that a new toilet paper?
It may as well be used as toilet paper, but it's NOT new.. been a liberal RAG since 1951.
A conservative legal group called on FISC to investigative government leaks http://circa.com/politics/government/a-conservative-legal-group-called-on-fisc-to-investigative-government-leaks … @nytimes will need to ANSWER for 'leaks'
No big deal. An honest mistake and they apologized. But DJT lies all the time and NEVER apologizes. We can forgive NYT, but not POTUS #45 
 #failingnewyorktimes
Don't call NYT a NEWSpaper anymore, more like a supermarket tabloid.
No one but you really gives a flip.  #EgotisticalIncompetent45 #InvestigateImpeachProsecute
President Nixon was awesome. Obamagate 100x'worse.
Why Would Patriots, even want to be there anyways. They have no desire trust me, impeach Trump
Ten to one this anchor has been sexually harassed.
CNN Fake News!
Hurray for @PresidentTrump!
You can't help that most didn't want to attend!
And, when have YOU EVER apologized for ANYTHING?
At least some people can say "sorry" I made a mistake. The clown in the WH NEVER admits he was wrong -- SOOOOOO MANY times.
Nothing new but you would think @nytimes would finally grab a clue that their going to get called out for all their BS news!
But stupid people still believe them.
I guess that they bought all 133 Pulitzer prizes for journalism? I guess that WE should believe Trumps buddies paper the National Enquirer!!
They have been misleading the public for the last year and a half.  Nothing new and nothing but a fake apology.
Truth is - NONE of the very fake news reports sent out by main stream media are true. This is just one of thousands!!
Wait what?  The NYT doing things to make POTUS look bad??
