Trump,tax dodger
BUT the US has to raise taxes to make up for the "smart" people that don't pay their share.

You're under audit -- that means something fishy is going on. Even more reason to show us! @realDonaldTrump
liberty, freedom, and the constitution are definitely not a progressive value. Unless it's for themselves @realDonaldTrump
So you cool with Trump attacking civil liberties? @Son_of_the_2nd @realDonaldTrump
Please stop talking about taxes like you care...I'm predicting very hard times ahead for you. Your brand is tanking BIGLY!

@gcamp4 @ChelseaClinton #Millennials #LatinosForTrump #FL #VA #OH #PA #africanamerican #NC #NH #IA #NV #CA #CO #MN #WA #WI
At least she pays taxes
re you paying "no" taxes... smart - yes... but better argument is that YOU are following the laws... tax reform is coming
Medusa Trump and you paid  how much??????
next time HRC asks about your taxes, tell her you emailed it to her.
"She" must be stopped! !! #trump train #MAGA
and trump voted...0 times because he has no political experience whatsoever.
rofl! oh the hypocrisy!
fact or fiction ?
@ladies4trump: Why is it Government's answer to everything is "Raise Taxes" without Fiscal Responsibility #MAGA
yeah because people like you find ways to not pay them
At least she paid her taxes instead of being rich and riding on the backs of the lower and middle class
why don't you mention Bill Clinton's despicable treatment of Hillary and the message sent to girls and other wives.
Do you pay tax, Donald? Prove it.
Donald Trump's bad tax habit. Not paying them...
http://fortune.com/2016/09/26/donald-trumps-tax-returns-debt/ …

Trumps bad tax habit - thinks NOT paying is a good Business practice. #patrioticmyass #trump4trump
u r so unbelievably sad! U have lots of money but you have no class.u r so embarrassing with you caveman mind. Hope u lose
I just can't believe people can see through crooked hillary http://bullshit.how  much more needs to be done
That because democraps always BLOW all the $$ they steal with taxes and then come back for MORE. They NEVER change.
why do you care you don't pay them anyway?
Why has Mr. Trump NOT addressed the fact that George Soros, a huge Hillary donor, owes $7 BILLION in back income taxes???
Like we don't work hard enough!
Tax, spend and regulate. Hillary's mantra
@Trump_World Howard Dean is saying you were on drugs…he needs to be put in check
Look at her tummy. No fat food. No tax.
I THINK TIM LAINE ALSO VOTED TO TAKE AWAY PENSIONS FOR VETS.
I rather have higher taxes than a  fucked up  president.
There wouldn't be any higher taxes made if our country cut out all the wastes of taxpayers money including their pay hikes.
higher taxes on the rich. NOT the middle class. #PayYourShare

have you seen yours boy?
and your bad coke habit. #TrumpSniffles
you have no place to talk about taxes when you are too scared to show yours.
Chump's bad tax habit: not paying them!
Is Hillary's habit as bad as your coke habit? #SnifflingTrump
you've got a pretty bad tax habit when you, you know, don't pay them AND THEN ADMIT TO IT
YOU MUST BRING THAT OUT IN THE NEXT DEBATE.  She sure won't bring it up.   GO TRUMP
They had her so made up last night - her skin looked liked she was 20 yr old.  Deceives about everything, doesn't she?
So you'd finally get around to paying taxes. When are they going to look for the hidden cash?
you are the only one that could stop her bad habit
Hillary and her constituents are a wee bit slow.
Hillary has a thief's heart.  Taxes are theft.
Like all left, Hillary believes that the rich should pay more. She does not recognize the great talent of the rich. Envy.
Where do you taxes REALLY go ?   To Federal Reserve, to the Crown, to the Vatican, the banker, do some research.
Hillary Clinton must not win as we will be taxed to death. She has no mercy. Vote Trump 

She wants to raise taxes on the MIDDLE CLASS, back bone of AMERICA. We already support her welfare cases. NO
She's going to have to really raise taxes to pay for free college! We cannot afford this
Not sure how Hillary's tax plan puts more disposable income into people's wallets & purses to buy products & services.
Not sure how Hillary's tax plan accomplishes anything when businesses leave nation & no one working to pay taxes.
First pay your taxes and then we can talk. Release your tax report!!! What are you hiding?
BREAKING NEWS!!!  MORE LIES FROM AMERICA'S --AND THE WORLD'S-- LYER IN CHIEF!!!
Hillary is scary!  She says she'll only tax the rich.  Another lie. The middle class will not exist!
you have a terrible temperament, rude,interruptive last night, many people though you were on drugs, you were beaten down!
internet taken over by un 10/1/16.we are loosing our sovereignty! Expose Hillary crimes! " Study and show thyself approved"
hey show us your taxes, you have no excuse. The IRS says you are free to do so even though you're being audited
speaking of taxes, where's your returns?
she never met a tax on the middle class she didn't like,
Please start firing back w/ counter ads...you did incredible at the debate Mr Trump....keep swinging, we need you!!!!
at least she paid her taxes
well if people like you paid their taxes, perhaps she wouldn't need to keep taxing the top 1%.
Yet you don't pay any taxes, and want to keep it that way. So smart not to help pay for the roads that lead to your hotels.
any unbiased monerators, such as liz wheeler, Tomi lahren, Graham Ledger, Sean Hannity or even Megyn Kelly
this is what has destroyed our lives taxes Americans when we get done with taxes the dollar is worth 10 cents nomiddle lads
Why would you care, you don't pay them.
@Ma1973sk To feather her own bed too I am sure.
why didn't you say that?? Please, please study for next debate. Our country is depending in you!!
... does the Clinton Foundation pay income taxes?? I'm not sure
I have a good feeling when I think of Trump as President, keep up the good fight and let the BITCH have it next time!
they need to get that budget under control!  More money is not the answer!
do you have a bad coke habit? #releaseyourtaxes
these negatives are FACTS against Hillary- solar panels to China - 8 solar companies under by Obama/Clinton
on the rich...?!
and yet you still never paid them 
GO Trump!!!!
at lease she pays her taxes!!!!
she is taxing and regulating small business and farm families right out of business. We need TRUMP!!!!
IF Hillary steals this election Hillary's IRS will STEAL from our kids 65% of the money we worked TO EARN over 52 years!
more Trump lies
because there are deadbeats who don't pay taxes at all. Anyone you might know, Don?
tax returns or gtfo
why don't you pay some taxes before you talk about somebody else and taxes! #DebateNight
it is obvious Trump is against taxes since he pays next to none!
Maybe you should pay yours for a change
you REALLY NEED TO prepare MUCH better. Missed opportunities to score. Bengazi, pay for play, "what diff does it make"
why do you care? You don't pay taxes
let's "DO THE RIGHT THING"...say it loud, & it has meaning
If that's true, we didn't hear it last night??? Wouldn't that have been better than apologizing for your tax returns-OMG
do people understand why taxes are raised??! For our own country's good, so that more money is put out into our country...
You went bankrupt 6 times so you could stiff banks and employees. And you paid no taxes...and said I'm smart? Really?
mr trump u had some many opportunities to bury Hillary. No mention of many critical issues with her.
but at least she'll pay hers 
RELEASE UR TAX RETURNS & admit #SleazyTrump doesnt pay fair share Trump is running a con on American ppl #UNFIT #UNBALANCED
is a coward 2 deny releasing taxes @HillaryClinton released hers 4 decades & shows Clintons paid taxes & gave 2 charities
I heard @realDonaldTrump denies ppl transparency by releasing taxes cuz #SleazyTrump has paid ZERO taxes & shady biz dealings #UNFIT
And maybe they wouldn't have to go up if people like you paid their share of taxes.
what about how many times u never paid taxes? If ur so proud of smartness to pay 0, go ahead and disclose returns!
#High #taxes only #benefit #Democrats #HRC
@ReversingASD - Keep the facts pouring in!
and by your own admission, you didn't pay a single penny of them. Sit down!
was up 2 you 2 bring "it" into debate, too many missed opportunities, you got played, who was guy passing HRC folder 2 LH?
Did you see they're  game, it's called 3 turns  HILLARY, you  HILLARY then Lester.

Easy to say for a man that doesn't pay any taxes
@HillaryClinton show us your taxes @realDonaldTrump
Dems raise taxes so they have more of our money to waste!  Produce more government jobs that taxpayers have to support.
"i'm here for the people" -Crooked @HillaryClinton !
.@realDonaldTrump @kimjgoodwin The Politibears want Mr. Trump to ask Hollary how much is a fair share for the rich to pay in taxes.
