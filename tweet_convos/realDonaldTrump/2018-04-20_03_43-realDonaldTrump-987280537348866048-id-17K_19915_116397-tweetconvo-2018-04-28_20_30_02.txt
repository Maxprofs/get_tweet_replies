WTF?  Is that a supporter or an opponent.  Jesus freaks supporting @realDonaldTrump ......how does that work?
I’m a proud atheist, but even I know @realDonaldTrump has broken most of the Ten Commandments.  OK..Here comes the backdraft...I’m taking cover men...
I'm with u, Jane. I love my country. I first learned of @realDonaldTrump in the late 80's. He was a self-absorbed, lying, cheating bully then & remains the same now...only with power. People can attack me all they like. I AM a patriot. Donald Trump is most assuredly not. #Resist
No way in hell are you still going to be president by May 25th.
I sure hope you’re right! Damn!!
I'm not often disappointed by the USNA but.......

Here we are. 

Boo on this decision by the Academy. As a child of an alumni & a lifelong fan, I'm hugely disappointed. @NavalAcademy
Honestly, this makes me sad/mad for the graduates. They've worked hard to get where they are & to have you come & tRump it up is a disgrace to their hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. Not to mention, these KIDS are more brave on their worst day, than you've EVER been. #Resist
They deserve an historic speaker, but I guess going down in history as the most corrupt and self centered president meets the criteria.
Ugh and we all know that he's going to turn their commencement into a campaign rally, since that's all President Campaignsalot knows how to do.
You mean like Obama turned the coast guard graduation into a climate change lecture?
Considering how the climate actually DOES affect the Coast Guard, I consider your point completely ridiculou & dismissed. Next...
Really? How about it’s about the graduates, not his idiot policies?
Commencement speeches have traditionally been about preparing graduates for what's to come. Talking to Coast Guard graduates about climate change is completely in line with that. Bragging to them about the "great job" you're doing avoiding jail time is not.
Nice! They’ll be in for a great speech, that’s for sure!
Trump’s Twitter account and his speeches are the things that go him elected.
Do I hear that James Comey leaked classified info and lied about it?
So maryland! GREAT our I to annapolis the be may forward being in at looking exciting speaker 25th academy there, commencement. Agreed on to have naval.

Are you on meds?
Nice. Another diarrhea-of-the-mouth moment for you. Remember 2 ramble on & on & on...again...about Hillary, Comey, the Democrats & any other person or group that has more intrinsic value than yourself. My condolences 2 the ears of the Naval Academy students, faculty...& America.
Right on.
Current: Cloudy with regular tweets; 98% chance Donald Trump wrote this himself.

Tweet Forecast: Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to give even one vote for massive Tax Cut Bill.

I served 6 Presidents, 3 Rs & 3Ds. I directly supported Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama. While I didn't agree with all their policy choices, I admired and respected all of them, as they put country above their personal interests. Not so with you, as your self adoration is disgraceful …
Hopefully you’re arrested on stage
Not Cadet Bone Spurs! Joke
For those just joining us:

- No, there won’t be a wall.
- Yes, Trump colluded with Russia.
- Yes, Trump obstructed justice.
- Trump will do whatever it takes to protect himself from the consequences of his actions.
For those of consumed by hate. Trump is building a wall as we type, the only collusion was from Obama and Hillary and their criminal posses, the Democrats will never get power back as they can’t do it legally. Trump haters are spontaneously combusting with envy and hate
Will you be discussing your battle with VD (that you lost several times) or your bone spurs? 

Please answer. #MakeAWish
Likely going over the harrowing massacre at Bowling Green.
And to discuss the ongoing investigation into illegal covfefe operations...
#Navy
Captain of a sinking ship. What could be more appropriate?
Those poor students.

Make sure you remind them not to get captured. 

We don't like the ones who get captured.
The POTUS gets off on this type of stuff.  Self promotion from a POTUS is so bizarre.
Go Navy! 
Draft dodger? Think again and stop listening to the #LiberalIdiots who think they know everything.
He is NOT a draft dodger. He has never "disrespected gold star families" who were respectful
It’s amazing how little people know that watch fox
I know, right?
Thank God I don't watch @FoxNews
If you watched others you would know that trump avoid the draft several times
I know all about it!
Trump was medically deferred. He was not a "draft dodger"
Draft dodgers left the country.
Oh please bone spurs ???? Right must have had terrible arthritis which is how you typically get bone spurs seems to have recovered nicely
I just lost all respect for @NavalAcademy administration. Multi-time #DraftDodger has NO RIGHT to address our military! @realDonaldTrump has been an utter embarrassment as #POTUS. #NavalAcademy chooses to ignore? How very unfortunate for the graduates. #NoTrumpAtNavalAcademy
Not their fault they lost the coin toss this year.
Surely they can reject having Trump speak. We need SOMEONE in this country to grow some balls. Imagine the impact if @NavalAcademy took a stand. Millions would applaud them. #NoTrumpAtNavalAcademy
My thoughts exactly I just couldn’t find the words so thank you
Thanks, Rachel. It wasn't eloquent. Just the truth as I see it. Sick of those in positions of power & influence rolling over & playing dead when it comes to this madman.
The graduates will be dumber for having heard you speak.
WOW ，That sounds like the best speech ever
I bet the last time you were surrounded by that much seamen you were in Mar-a-Lago with a Playmate in a sailor’s hat.
That is going to be a  show or pee show. Urine trouble peetard
Trumps speech. “Many many people are saying that I am the greatest naval er, um, guy, sailor person thing ever. If I’d been at Pearl Harbour I’d have swatted those planes before they dropped a bomb. It was the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbour you know, not many people know that”
YAY!
#ilovemyPresident
Not just the US Navy’s President, Trump is also every liberal in America’s President too! 
Meanwhile in London...
Meanwhile in Syria...
Meanwhile at Tony Podesta’s House.  No really, Tony owns these... 
And finally a word from Liberal sponsor and spokesperson Pocahontas...
Snake oil salesman and conman.
Disgusting.
Just remember it's not a campaign stop. Show them respect it's not about you that day. I am sure you are capable of that.
That should be fun. Try not to get hit by a flying hat. (P.S.--they're the military. They HAVE to invite you).
The Christian Taliban crows LOVES this one
Comey memos reveal that Trump endorsed rape as an instrument of state sponsored torture. Frustrated by reporters who refused to name leakers, Trump proposed jailing them. ‘They spend a couple days in jail, make a new friend, they are ready to talk.’

Not exciting...at all. You'll whine and cry like a triggered snowflake. Those kids deserve better than you.
Wonderful. A draft dodger with no integrity or morals spewing his rhetoric on honorable men and women. I’m sure you’ll make a gggreat impression #PresidentSpanky.
They should decline you for being a draft dogger #CadetBoneSpurs
So embarrassing for the graduates

How wonderful. The coward, #CadetBoneSpurs will deliver the Commencement Address. Will he overcompensate for the 5 draft deferrals by turning this into a Pre-Campaign Speech? #Sad
What an honor to have a sitting @POTUS as the Speaker!
You going to follow script? Or just ramble incoherently for 45 minutes about your approval ratings, the wall, and Hillary?
IF MCCAIN SHOWS UP STEP ON HIS FOOT DONALD !! SHOULD BE AT THE TOMB OF THE KNOWN TRAITOR SOON !!!
So you can tell everyone how you won the election, yell about Obama & Clinton, generally waste everyone's time. You are no inspiration & to be forced to sit there & listen to your 4th grade communication abilities is pure torture. What a lousy reward for years of hard work.
You're the first draft dodger to speak at Annapolis.
PLEASE Don't bring up Hillary, Obama of fake news.  you can't can you?

Roughly half won’t want you there. #seamen #AmericasNavy #NavyInnovates #Navy
More than half.

Another set of special memories tainted !
Fu #45
Seriously, someone from Annapolis invited you to give the Commencement speech, of which, all of them knowing you stated about John McCain, he's a war hero because he was captured, I like people who weren't captured." Annapolis should have invited John McCain, a true war hero.
he invited himself. they can’t say no. he’s their boss. talk about powerlessness

Ok, I'm a Trump supporter, but that's funny
The graduates are NOT looking forward to being there! "I'm so great, look at me! My crowds so big, look at me! I can't get enough of ME, ME, ME!"
They will have to disinfect the Academy after you finish polluting it.
I thought trumpity dumpity was going to speak at an orange grove in Florida!
Biggest orange grove ever!
The Navy hates you.  I was in the Navy, my son is in the Navy, many of my friends are former Navy or Marines and it's unanimous.  We hate you Donny boy.
My youngest son is a Marine. He  despises Trump. The ranks are swelling daily. Thank you, Dougie, for all you and your family have contributed to our nation.
Thanks Barbara and to you and yours as well.

Punctuation error. Semicolon is used to join independent clauses, not to indicate list. Colon would also be incorrect after the verb are.

Remember, it is THEIR day, don't make it all about you....oh, hell. A guy can dream, can't he?
don’t gloat, it’s just your turn to do so, it’s not like they actually  want a draft dodger and someone who mocks Navy POW’s to actually give the speech
Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger. Draft dodger.
Be sure to regale them with stories on how you avoided the draft 5 times, and sent 5 other brave men to serve and die in your place.

Shame on the @NavalAcademy for trying to normalize a cowardly, perverted con artist. Hope his speech is more coherent for the Navy than it was for the Boy Scouts.
Dear @NavalAcademy - why are you inviting a treasonous draft dodger who can’t spell & lies incessantly to speak at commencement? Just bc he is POTUS, he won fraudulently & brings no honor to the office - in fact he’s an embarrassment - you need to rethink this invitation
You should check to see if you have any deferments left and use it.
Too bad Naval officers are held to a much higher standard than you. They can't walk out. They will be higher educated and therefore more likely to not approve of you.
Wow, someone sure hates this year’s graduates at the Naval Academy.
Are they crazy?
Why would the Naval Academy invite a 5 TIME draft dodger who INSULTED an Alumni (McCain) and BULLIED Gold Star families to speak at their commencement? 

Perhaps they want the graduates to experience COWARDICE & CRUELTY in person. 

It’s the only explanation for such a offer.
But you can't even speak properly! What are you going to say? "Great, tremendous job graduating strongly.   I won the electoral college by a landslide." Before waving and heading back to maralago?? Stay home and #resign already!
Headline “ draft dodger speaks at naval academy graduation “
Oh God, I hope you're not reading from a script.  You sound like a constipated gorilla when you attempt to read.  But then again, I'm sure you'll make it all about you, like you always do.  Its a graduation, how about you stay on topic.
#NarcissistInChief
Great idea to invite a 5 time draft dodger and traitor to the United States to speak. Someone did not think this through.
Hey, have you ever seen you wife look so happy as she did today while sitting beside President Obama?
#Namibia #Hollande #Cyprus #Mexico #Cuban #Kenyans #IMF #Vamp #360Video #XinhuaTV #BREAKING #Homs Seek help ! #fanya

#Moroninchief.Kindergarteners can read, write & speak better than you!Feel sorry for the naval graduates they deserve better @NavalAcademy
Oh goodness, #annapolis.  Get ready for an hour of pompous meandering bullshit that will confuse you and make you question your future. #wtf #goodluck
All those cadets will be able to look back and say, yep, we had Trump as our commencement speaker, right before he was sent to death row for treason.
Can you try really hard to make it about the graduates and not talk about yourself?? I know you can’t, but try.
The President of the United States is always invited every year, on a rotating basis, to one of the military service academy’s commencements. This is not something new. Bet you will talk about yourself and not the graduates. That will be new. #TrumpCorruption
Those poor grads have to listen to the WORST POTUS in history

You’re a 5x draft dodger and insulted a Vet, John McCain numerous times. Why the Naval Academy wants you is insulting to everyone in the service and Vets.
DRAFT DODGERS SHOULD NEVER SPEAK AT ANY MILITARY ACADEMY.
The OFFICE is always invited.
Try not to embarrass yourself in front of the non-bonespur crowd.
This is an honour you absolutely do not deserve!

Calm down, prom queen. Don’t count your chickens before they’re indicted.

@Rosie @BrunoAmato_1
No one better for this honor.. Go Navy!!
My sympathies to the graduating class. 
#TrumpCrimeSyndicate
Shame on the USNA for inviting u, a draft dodger; who ridiculed a decorated hero and a Gold mother; who said he always wanted a Purple but by someone handing u one it had been easier, insulting every brave Purple recipient. U have no place there.
I'm also excited. I love when you talk, because you inevitably reveal how utterly unqualified you are to have the role you have.
@NavalAcademy Commandant Chadwick, with all due respect, what are you thinking?  Midshipmen are expected to hold truth and honor in highest esteem.  How does @POTUS delivering the Commencement address promote  those values?
You did not agree. You begged.
So very very glad I had A real President, Officer and Gentleman when I graduated - VP George HW Bush.  So very glad I do NOT have to listen to #CadetBoneSpurs lie.  You violate EVERY part of the Midshipman Honor Code that I hold dear.
And 45 isn't saying that POTUS typically rotates through the service academies; there is really nothing unique about the invitation.
This is an incredibly bad (and stupid) idea. How can the folks in charge at the Academy not see this?????
@JazminMyshell is refusing to work that day because he will be in the area! Horrible idea!
Apparently, they rotate the president, VP, secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff every four years. So I’d hardly say he was “chosen”.
Thanks for the research! Still a horrible idea, but at least based on reason.
I love the ego on this clown. Anyone else would say something like "I am honored to..." but not Donny! "I have agreed to..." like it's a big pain in the ass, but he's doing everyone a favour because of how great he is. 

Fuck you.
Just know that you might be arrested at any moment while giving that address.
Omg.  Sorry to hear. You deserve better Navy.
Will you tell them about your service in Vietnam? What was that? Bone spurs.
You’re a 5-time DRAFT DODGER. Aren’t you ashamed to even stand in front of so many who did what you refused to do? They all volunteered, but you claimed bone spur! Coward.
This is the lowest point for #Annapolis You mean you couldn't find ANYONE else besides, this loud mouth, pathological lying, trash talking, draft dodging, racist, misogynist, sex offending #TraitorTrump to speak to at this year's Naval academy? The cadets deserve BETTER!
Did you ask for a tension mat to stand on so you don’t hurt your little bone spurred tootsies?
I doubt he was invited to speak. Surely bullied his way to be a speaker.
I hope the cadets boycott
that makes one person who is happy about you being there.
Another fine opportunity to praise yourself and disparage your enemies (Democrats and media).
Doesn’t the graduating class of the US Naval Academy deserve a real American? One that’s willing to put their life on the line, even if their little piggies are sore, to give the Commencement Speech.
#MrPresident This doesn’t mean you can tell people you “Went to Annapolis”!!!
Stay away from the Air Force academy, you Bone spur, draft dodging Russian!
Why, those graduates don't want to hear your CAMPAIGN speech again!

My dad and father-in-law went to the Naval Academy - they both said to pass along: "FUCK YOU CADET BONE SPURS!!!!"
If I was graduating that day, I would show up, then stand and turn my back to trump as he spoke.

Fuck trump.
You don’t deserve to be there #CadetBoneSpurs. I’m hoping they come to their senses unless they want their commencement to be all about a narcissistic racist fool.
This is an outrage! Trump must have leaned on someone to get that invite. Who at Annapolis would be so dense as to invite this moron who can't complete a coherent sentence? Those poor graduates!!!
MY BROTHER ATTENDED ANNAPOLIS AND THE FACT THAT YOU'LL BE THERE WITH YOUR BONE SPURS IS VERY http://LUDICROUS.YOU  HAVE BUSINESS BEING
Cool. Will you be announced there as David Denison or John Barron?
Don’t forget they honor valor and honesty. Best not to bring yourself up
Cadet Bone Spurs gets to give a speech to those who choose to serve!
Those guys need a laugh after months of intensive training, so have at it.
Cadet Bone Spurs at the Naval academy. Go back to Russia. 

#CadetBoneSpurs #Treason #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpLies
Really? Will you lick their boots? Because that is how much more respectable than you every one of them are.
Don’t know why
There’s no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
You do know that doesn't count as military service don't you?
Sadly for them, they won’t be allowed to boo you off the stage because they understand decorum.
Love this....
POS Loser
You are a draft dodger and traitor. How many people did you pay off to get this?
With bone spurs
If you change your mind , just tell them your bone spurs flared up again.
@WestPoint_USMA for the love of all that is holy, please don't do this. There is no room for cowardice on your hallowed grounds. Generations of great men and women have stood upon that field, do not darken it with the taint of a man who won't even visit the Soldiers in theater.
2.  Let the Naval Academy take the shame for this, please.  Go Army, beat Navy!
I want someone to release the name of the man in charge who made this decision. He needs to be publically barbecued.
Try not to brag about yourself too much.  U are supposed to be inspring them not patting yourself on the back
That n all his other Bullshit.
No doubt you didn't give them a choice but to invite you. I hope the graduates boycott you -- and those who show up turn their backs.
Who arranged the Naval Academy commencement for you? Dr. Ronny?  I really feel sorry for those graduating. Just having to listen to your boasts & lies. SAD,
Dear @NavalAcademy,
I’d love to understand why you would invite an illiterate, five time draft dodger who has insulted one of your most illustrious graduates, John McCain & who has colluded w/ Russia to destabilize the democracy your graduates die for...to be commencement spkr?
It would be a great precedent if the @NavalAcademy rescinded their invite and showed the world that “residing” in the white house isn’t enough to be their commencement speaker; that one has to first have great character and above all, love the mission. He’s proven to have neither
Are you sure it's the one on Annapolis, Maryland? Maybe it's the one in Annapolis, California, or Annapolis, Indiana, or Annapolis, Ohio, or Annapolis, Missouri? So many choices! Hope you (don't) figure it out!
What a cluster this will be. 
Bigly, very very,believe me, everybody says,law and order ! There you have it ! Speech condensed for ya!
You don’t deserve to walk that hallowed ground. Your presence insults the honorable men and women who learn to lead there. Skip the ceremony and stay away, to honor them and their sacrifice.
Those poor humans. I feel bad that they have to sit through your x minutes of incoherent bloviating. Better have the barf bags ready.
Oh that is SO exciting!  Congrats and they couldn't have. BETTER Commencement Speaker!  God bless you, sir!  @realDonaldTrump
I’m sorry that our service men and women will be a captive audience having to listen to you talk about yourself.
Future Ensigns and Second Lieutenants: please remember US Navy Reg 1008 during this event. #HonorCourageCommitment
That is such a tragedy.   I guess  they want to say they had you speak before your impeachment and conviction.
Who in the hell decided this was a good idea!?
Hope you’re not in prison by then.

#CohenWillFlip #LockThemAllUp
Can’t wait to see how you’ll embarrass the country there.
Maybe you can talk to them about your technique for staying out of the service and avoiding VD during the Vietnam war. I’m sure they’ll be fascinated.
Seems like the right choice. #kakistocracy
You going to tell them about invisible planes #CadetBoneSpurs ?
Did you have to beg them, fucko?
You are *literally* about to ruin the greatest moment of these kids' lives. You'll make it about yourself and sound like a buffoon.  Shame.
How embarrassing for us.
They finally gave in to your begging, right?? 
Those poor families.
@realDonaldTrump come talk to us. Obama would walk the streets go into restaurants and mingle with the people he led. Obama would talk to regular people like me. You @realDonaldTrump have never attempted to communicate with regular people like me.  You think We are beneath you...
Such exciting! Our GREAT!!

How come nobody wanted you at 2017 commencement? Fire the whole lot of them for ignoring you!

#DirtyDonald #DieInJail
@realDonaldTrump I hope you are either impeached by 5/25 or arrested to save the USNA the embarrassment of you
What a disgrace that these cadets will have to sit through a speech full of hyperbole, attacks on former presidents,  outright lies about anything & everything. I wonder how many times he will slate Hillary, the media & whoever pops into his head that day. President bone-spurs.
A draft dodger giving the speech? Interesting.
Don't let your bone spur stops you.
And behind it all will be the snide remarks and laughs of patriots watching and listening to a bloated traitor flap his facehole with lies and more lies! You are a disgrace to this nation you idiot!
How disappointed those graduates must be...
Who at #Annapolis thought it was a good idea to invite a 5 time draft dodging coward, someone who called John McCain a coward and who has already committed treason by offering aid and comfort to #Russia after their cyber attack on our nation.
And I’ll bet the farm that you won’t be able to control yourself from saying there was no collusion.
Quote:: As a Navy Veteran I'd love 2 know who at #Annapolis thought it was a good idea 2 invite a 5X draft dodger, who called POW's like Navy Veteran John McCain cowards & who has already committed treason by offering aid & comfort 2 Russia after their cyber attack on our nation.
Cadet Bone Spurs addresses The Naval Academy now that's funny right there...

GOP=TOTAL FRAUDS
Treason weasel bone spur coward giving speech to ?
Donny will be speaking about the Tremendous Sacrafices involved in dealing with Bone Spurs and picking up D-List celebrities at Studio 54.
@realDonaldTrump really is the village idiot 
Every village needs one! Where would #MAGA America be without my sweet Donny??

You do a GREAT job of serving as a really bad example of a human. Just tell the grads not to be anything like you.  
Certainly they have  zero respect for you
Bit of advice, hon. Try not to talk about your own wonderfulness and fabulousness, ok? First, you don't want to be exposed to a scene of mass vomiting. Second, I know you don't like to be laughed at. Third, you don't want to look like a fool...again.
They don't mind that you're a rich, spoiled, entitled brat and five time draft dodger that makes fun of Gold Star families? thought #Annapolis had, like, standards.
How embarrassing for the cadets.

As a Marine veteran, I have to say I am shocked and disappointed at this decision by the @NavalAcademy. Bringing in a 5X draft dodger and a person that called @SenJohnMcCain a coward is an absolutely disgusting idea!!
Those poor kids.
Those poor sailors deserve so much better. You are literally the scum at the bottom of the barrel.
Oh right let’s let Mr. 5 time draft dodger bone spurs give a speech at the Naval Academy for commencement. What could possibly go wrong?
Whoopdefuckendoo
WATCH YOUR BACK #TREASON #CORRUPTION HUMANITY IS DEPENDING ON YOU #GreatAwakening
You dodged the draft and know families whose kids signed up to defend our country are stuck with u it's a tragedy
Was everyone else busy that day?!?
Yeah, because the midshipmen can't leave.  And I'm sure they'll love hearing all about your favorite and only subject. you.
I'm hoping the Nation will have come to its senses by May 25th! #ImpeachTrump #MuellerInvestigation #PutinsPuppet #ProtectMueller
You don't deserve to be in the same room as those cadets. #CadetBoneSpurs
I’m sure they’re not excited . 
How many times did you dodge the draft? I believe it was five times wasn’t it.
May God help those poor graduates!
How desperate. Someone needs to tell him its not that kind of navel.. Cant wait to hear his tall tales of his biglyness..
