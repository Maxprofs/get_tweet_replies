@AlecBaldwin is a superb actor but a whiny leftist crybaby. Hollywood would better serve us all by zipping it. #NoPolitics
@LibertyNews1776 @realDonaldTrump @AlecBaldwin Superb actor? I think you're exaggerating some...
Baldwin is more Trump than Trump!! LOL!
Nobody plays Trump better than Trump.  That I can tell you.
LOL! I think Baldwin will show up in an upcoming Trump movie!!!
At this point we don't need a parody for Trump, he parodies himself
I'm curious, how does one "suppress the the Trump?"  Seriously, I wanna know so I can be involved in the effort. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/790534428942622721 …
That's why I like Baldwin.  He's a parody of a parody which makes him twice as funny!
Yep.  He clearly got under Trump's skin, so that means he was doing a good job
NO COMMENT 
Get over it
 You sound like a kid in middle school! Believe it or not Donald,  SNL it to the park
Thanks for the @thehitjob shout out, @realDonaldTrump! We loved #SNL skit too! Pretty sure that's what you meant. Darn those media riggers!

#CrookedTrump if you skin is that thin you chose the wrong job to go for!
@AlecBaldwin Alec Baldwin SUCKS
DICK ^^^ LMAO
@girl4Trump @AlecBaldwin is a real piece of work
And to this day SNL is still using Trump skits. SNL really went down hill. Like at the bottom of the hill. Like it’s dead. Lorne needs to stop.
After throwing Clinton in jail, Trump will continue to follow in his heroes' footsteps and declare satire a criminal act.
People with a sense of humor found it hysterical, but thin skinned narcissists can't take it- they can only dish it out-SAD
I watched SNL once in 20 yrs. To see #Trump! He was amazing Funny Warm & a good sport! #TrumpTrain  #MAGA
WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH
you're*
libarral snowflace checcer,, geht phucen liphe!!!
thanks cornflake. Same goes for you!
let's give a big thank you to the cornflake leader Bernie(same as your GIF), your progressive master!!!
not gonna lie. LOVE BERNIE.
LMAO #whineylittlebitch with more whining and Alec Baldwin portrayal was spot on perfect!!
I hope you're watching tonight. @nbcsnl #ChappelleOnSNL #SNLChappelle
you might want to skip SNL this week then.
LOL! He nailed how stupid and creepy you are! #nevertrump #DonTheCon
Weren't you on the show a few months ago. DOES THAT MEAN YOU RIGGED THE ELECTION!
people are saying Baldwin did an excellent job.  SPOT on!
FOCUS
California farmers for trump

That's the thing with SNL, First time-funny ; Second time-MEH ; Third time-C'mon Already / their jokes sure get old fast!
@nytimes @NBC @CNN It shows how stupid Alec is!
He does not know how to be funny.
I agree with you Mr. Trump. I stopped watching SNL years ago. I don't see what anyone see's in this low class crap!
the show snl..was. funny....and true...
Time to retire your boring and unfunny run for president. Trumps portrayal of presidential candidate stinks. #BadForAmerica
- no Donald, it's that smart people get how unsuitable you are for the job and are using their power to make sure you fail
.@realDonaldTrump thank goodness you weren't on the Simpsons. You'd probably try to grope Marg and then suggest locking up Bart #lunatic
...don't you have more important things to worry about Mr. President???
Alec Baldwin is terrific.  It is funny because he is exactly like u.  Don't stop Alec.
Media rigging??? How about the truth and the fact that you and the Russians rigged the election! #TrumpTwitterTirade
Trump you need to grow up and act like a president
WAKE UP BALDWIN  GET ON THE TRUMP TRAIN PRESIDENT  TRUMP  !!!ENOUGH OF THE TRUMP SKIT IT IS boring
keep your head high and remember Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.
"Teddy Roosevelt "
Stay on message do not take the bait.
Borders,  2nd Admin , security, defense, jobs, economic growth, trade
SNL must have gone down hill fast since you hosted it not very long ago. Connection? Donald Trump makes things fail? Sad.

Insecure much?? #AlecBaldwinForPresident  #SNL is and always has been hilarious political humor! #CryBabyDrumpf
you're just mad his portrayal is spot on, and now you know how the rest of us feel having to watch you talk. 
Suck it up buttercup! He has you down pat! And you didn't think it was "rigged" when you were leading. #SHutup
Didn't he host SNL a few months ago?
Hilarious!
I just found it hilarious that a month ago he was publicly complaining that snl was rigging the election against him.
@AlecBaldwin You kidding Donald.. It was the best ever... You should be greatful
-> It's just "sour grapes," Mr. Prez. Alec Baldwin "dreams 3 times per night" wishing he was you.  Alec's just a "Sad Sack"
They can try we are #WOKE
It’s comedy. Laugh. Haha. Try it!  It’s fun!

You are such an embarrassment to this country!  We all know you are lying, especially when you say #Believeme.
everything you just tweeted but replace Alec Baldwin and Media with your name! #suckitupbuttercup #delicatesnowflake
.Do not take this so personal,is a very funny show and you should enjoy it and laugh.
.@realDonaldTrump did SNL hurt your feelings? Tell your Daddy Bannon. #StopPresidentBannon
Can't stop now, they've got 4 years PRIME MATERIAL to look forward to!  #DUMPTRUMP
it's so you donnie
"Make SNL great again!"
Hey Donny lighten up! Unless it is true.
the only thing that's rig is your casinos.
cry-baby
SNL is OLD, tired and boring
Alec Baldwin just lets you see how you really look. And you're right you really stink.
alec baldwin is a washed up actor and also neglected to pay taxes on an art piece. He should not eat where he shits.
Comedy is freedom of speech bro calm down
@realDonaldTrump
Where's your sense of humor? It's hilarious!
stop watching
wrong
@AlecBaldwin grow up and quit whining.  My 81 yr old Dad with one arm raised 7 children, no whining or name calling allowed
@AlecBaldwin Please! Give the guy an Emmy.  Funniest thing I've seen in ages
I want you to win Donald, but SNL was pretty funny.

@AlecBaldwin Alec is on the board of "People For the American Way" - involved in voter fraud. Rigged! Media collusion
Dont vote for this creature as he is an autocratic monster. His followers see only what they want to & not his crimes
Fuckin baby.
wow,Alec Baldwin,did excellent job. love SNL& daily show ,Trevor Noa, OMG , r u kidding Donald,they are funny and http://true.lol 
HeavenO @AlecBaldwin of #SaturdayNightLive! Please make @realDonaldTrump #LookGood now because #TheDonald doesn't deserve to be #upset #now.
#AlecBaldwin of #SaturdayNightLive tried to make @realDonaldTrump #LookBad but he was #FunnyAsHell. Even #Trump will #Laugh at it #someday.
you haven't seen the last of me... I'll get you my pretty!!! And you're little hands too!!
hey Donald, are you gonna retire like Nigel Farage after you took back control?
It's really sad to see this orange man continue to suffer a mental breakdown on social media
.@realDonaldTrump If you shut down everything that displeases you, Americans will be forbidden to do or say anything?? #NeverTrumputin
obama administration  is trying his best in order to wrap mousul as a gift to Hillary s campaign.
Repeat things enough and they become true according to Tump. What an out of control narsasist.
@SheWent2_JaredZ
lmao chill it was a joke
well....you r the perfect material for #SNL. Perfect parody of how ridiculous you r. @ABC @CNN @MSNBC We ALL were laughing!
the ratings are UUUUUUUGGGGGEEEE  for SNL we still love the show...hate trump @realDonaldTrump
Awwwww....did someone say something not nice about you?   Karma sucks,  doesn't it?  #GrabThemByThePxxxy @SNLUpdate
your right the election is rigged. No one has any other idea how you got this far.
you're a dipshit re: @nbcsnl
I just wish you get back to the subject and make America great again

hahahahahah!! you're the main one rigging (botching) your own election.  #BillyBushMadeMeDoIt #dunce
Oh grow up old man. If you can't take the heat, you're not fit for the job. You don't hear Hillary endlessly whining

I found it funny.
I watched it too!! In reply to your comments: My Ass! That was funny shit, It was Spot On!!! "That I can tell ya.. smh
OMG Donny SNL is really funny!
@AlecBaldwin sounds like time for #indiemusic why be bored with what the media forces us all to watch or listen to ???
- Hopefully Alec Big mouth will leave the country too when you become POTUS. Just like the rest of Holly wood elites
u just salty fam
Thought it was HILARIOUS!!!!
The Emmy's were rigged too since you didn't win. WHAT a coincidence!
you're bothered by a skit show's portrayal of you? How th are you suppose to run a country? #thinskin
In regards to your view SNL should be retired, what should be retired is your campaign and that nest on your head.
Donnie; I'm voting for you but learn to laugh. It was funny
Alec Baldwin is bomb! The best portrayal yet!  Great show!!!!!
The best part of these debates is Baldwin and MacKinnon on the next SNL.
I think they portrayed you very well
If you can't handle Alec Baldwin how will you ever be able to handle any foreign leader who disagrees with you?
It's called Comedy you whiny petulant child, Alex Baldwin was hilarious #SNL
didn't you host
@AlecBaldwin ALEC WE LOVE YOU GOOD JOB KEEP GOING
eres un llorón, Donald. Mejor ve el mensaje de Brozo, para que te termines de arder:
Chamac@s, se acerca el último debate gringo. Vamos metiéndole una calentada al mamerto racista de @realDonaldTrump pa que nos sienta  #Órale 
Baldwin's portrayal is just ok. @TonyAtamanuik is the best Trump.
If you can't handle SNL, how would you be able to handle the White House Press corps?  Fortunately, you won't have to.
you can't make America GREAT with a ALL WHITE AMERICA. You have invited violence from day one your RACIST and DEPLORABLE..
I don't give a damn who you are that shit was funny go HILLARY. America it's HILLARY FOR PRESIDENT OR HITLER. I'm with her
@MELANIATRUMP just confirmed on Anderson Cooper that you are a follower NOT a leader! 
hang in there Mr Trump. We got your back. #LongIslandLovesTrump
. @realDonaldTrump You do realize that you completely bash anything and anyone who says anything negative toward you. #narcissistic behavior
If you cannot find humor in the latest SNL, you have no sense of humor!
Hah. Last year, you were happy to host, but now that they're making fun of you, you hate them.
HOW IS THAT 'UNFUNNY'??¿¿???
Forget them they are not important to the voters. We have more important issues.
don't be mad that Alec plays a better Dump Trump than you 
- it's political humor SNL has done for decades. Every candidate is fair game in comedy. Get over it.
hope Obama "turns off" Russia's internet the 1st- 3rd week in November. Ruskie jack asses. RW traitors.
it was so funny. Alec has you down. I bet your Russian friends did not like it. Con, you are a threat to world peace.
Oh, lighten up, Donald...they hit Hillary just as hard.
weren't you on it last year ? Man for claiming to be "tough" you r such a wuss
time to retire the bigotry and sexism act. Donald's portrayal of a presidential candidate stinks.
@kricket_71 vote Alec Baldwin on November 28.
No Sir..Spot on...
You're a pile of Rubbish.
#babydick #FUCKYOUTRUMP
- right cause you've never rigged a pageant. You're reaching, since your allegation numbers are higher than Tiger Woods
that was hilarious! He nailed the performance.  Political inspiration = amazing shows!  Great job @SNLUpdate writers/cast
well said
the show is great!  Very funny! Quit while your ahead!!! Alec Baldwin was great!
you are not fit to be President of this Great Country.
If anything, @AlecBaldwin flatters you, #Trump. You're actually much uglier, meaner, dumber + more ridiculous than that.
SNL wasn't too terrible last season when you went on it and made fun of others. Classic bully...loser.
You were awesome @AlecBaldwin I don't think you are rigging election, just that you are great.
MUST'VE HIT A NERVE LYING WELCHER
ROTFLMFAO I have never heard so much whining in my life. Boo hoo. Why don't you grow a pair? Or, keep proving you're weak.
- @katemckinnon and her Emmy say what?
I'm reading through your manic tweets and can't help but think of Amanda Byne's Twitter meltdown #isthisreallife
Loosen up. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. #comedy @nbcsnl
hey Donnie the only hit job is on. Nov 8 when we beat your sorry butt #stronger together #Dontboovote
if it retires will you?
The Melanianade bit was so good.
get a sense of humour you old sour puss.
where's your sense of humor? even POTUS laughed w/@ComedyCentral's luther. keep it up @nbcsnl - but @nbc release the tapes!
@AlecBaldwin poor deplorable trump always crying like a 5 year old baby
For the love of all that's holy, an election that HASN'T HAPPENED YET isn't RIGGED. & Media is reporting your own words.
haha! You're  a blow hard. You hosted the show a few years ago, correct ?
Everyone I know thought it was hilarious and spot-on. Must hurt, huh?
You have proven you don't understand respect for women, immigration, economy, truth, and now HUMOR. It was funny!! #debate
@AlecBaldwin Alec Baldwin is hilarious in dead ringer skit. Long live SNL! #nevertrump a de facto book burner.
@FamilyGuyonFOX made fun of you last night. More "rigging"? It can't be that you're despicable & brought this on yourself.
You have the thinnest skin of anyone ever known. Plus, you have the temper-trantrum mentality of a 2-year-old. Unqualified.
put on your big boy pants. If you can not handle being mocked by #SNL how will you react when it's a foreign leader?
do you think it's boring & unfunny or do you think it's a hit-job? Cos that seems a contradiction, you lunatic
wow what a cry baby.
where's your stamina? #ImWithHer
Seriously? Why don't you grow a sense of humour you big jerk RS RS
Two RS's there! Annoyed, I can tell! SRM
Whoops...that was a mistake RS
The show sucks and they have always been for the Looney liberals. Every show that has them on is one more show I despise and I encourage others too as well. Ellen and her love for Hillary is not allowed in my living room any longer. Jimmy Fallon and the rest
The amount of people who give a shit  about the Cheeto
#free speech
@huntercstafford
hate this man
