.@realDonaldTrump You didn't know this. You had to be told by @GStephanopoulos during an interview. #PutinsLoverboy #Deplorable
1st Instance Pre-ELECTION That I Knew Something Wasn't "Right": #StealthNEOCON #Trump Adopted The #NEOCON TalkingPoint "Russia took Crimea"!

.@realDonaldTrump Yes, indeed, "who wouldn't know this?" http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-clarifies-crimea-ukraine-226497 …
Lennon used to promote similar policies to yours. He overthrew the govt and invented communism  #5
so your against Russia now?  Make up your mind Donny
Hmmmmm, you didn't know that, clearly.
actually, you didn't know this until it was pointed out to you live in an interview.
Funny how you didn't know this a few weeks back. Sad. Lol.
.@MagicRoyalty @realDonaldTrump I know, it's terrible what Obama's done. Stock market up, employment up, 9 million more insured...
Are you copy-paste OCD?
He was hit...hard.
Ummmm....that's not what they found. Also...where'd Syria get chem weapons?

didn't you say Russia wasn't going into Crimea when they were already there? Who wouldn know this? YOU.
Clue - you did know this fact - if I were u ( thank God I am not) - I would not talk about it... Clueless
lol you didn't know
#Trump2016 - uhhhh apparently YOU DID NOT KNOW!!     http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/politics/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-crimea-putin/index.html …
is decimated in #Philadelphia by @BarackObama yesterday. #ObamaInPhilly
So ignorant!
President Obama isn't Kissin Putin's ASS like you! YOU BIRTHER
you didn't know that till @GStephanopoulos  told you on national TV, we all saw it
When Putin took Crimea (a war crime that undermines the West) I said he's "so smart." #ImWithPutin @realDonaldTrump
Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?
Only those who have interest in business dealing will Russians will praise Putin.
BULL !!!!!!!!
Deplorable language.
The word Bull is NOT deplorable language. I suggest you count to 10 and breath slowly
Use it front of parents or to your priest in the church see what they tell you, madam.
You're making a big deal out of nothing. It's just a word. Our country is falling apart  and you're worryng about a word.????
Sorry Our country is not falling apart. To me it is the greatest country in the world and I am blessed to be a citizen.
you didn't know it a week ago. You said Russia wasn't in Crimea! Did Russian TV help you out here?
exactly lol I bet he will say he never said it
you didn't know this about a month ago when you were asked about it........
Obama has commuted many crimes against our country. He most definitely is Anti-American and is not in our best interests.
I'm hearing you're a germaphobe. America will wash their hands of you on Nov 8.
how much money do you owe Russia again?
Is it true that Russia can fly surveillance over U.S.?
so now all of a sudden you know foreign policy.
why do you get a free pass on anything?

This is you mocking a disabled reporter.

Dude, you didn't even know Crimea was occupied on July, 1.
@cherokeesher2
.@realDonaldTrump I thought you said Russia wasn't in Ukraine
His Ukraine supporters would know. He has a lot of them..@realDonaldTrump

At least you're towing the party line like a good little peon. Glorious Leader may one day reward you with her presence.
Pack it in. Your education is showing.
.@realDonaldTrump Apparently you didn't know this because u were the one saying #Russia wouldn't go into #Ukraine as if they hadn't already
Why not stop with what Obama did or didn't do? Its all on HIM. We are already seeing that Trump Passing blame=Incompetence
called @potus for person of the United States. He is too small minded to fit into a size @POTUS44 The work is 2 big 4 Trump
Russia didn't take Crimea, Crimea succeeded to Russia. Sorry if the U.S. didn't like it.
Why are you trying to lift Russian sanctions?  Sounds like you want to give Russia a free pass.  #Trumprussia
If memory serves me right, Russia didn't 'take it'. 90% of Crimea voted for it.
yes they will few months after the annexation
"Who wouldn't know this" AFTER George Stephanopoulous told YOU during an interview we ALL witnessed.
WikiLeaks exposes media bias, Clinton team cheering Stephanopoulos’ use of talking points http://go.shr.lc/2e0Nwc7 
let's ignore that she is the most corrupt political candidate in modern times - she is very sick, more than being reported
How do u know so much about her health and honesty. U don't. Trump lies daily, is obese, OLDER and more at health risk then HRC
The state media gives all leftist and Marxists a pass.
@hateful_heretic Crimeans are ethnic Russians! Gratuitously given to Ukraine in 1954 by Khrushchev. Correct facts please!
YOUR THE ONE THAT DIDNT KNOW IT!!!! DUMMY
So you antagonize Putin when you manage to pull his dick from your mouth then, or
Obama lost Russia
Because your best buddy Putin took Crimea, not Obama.
Because he's part of the "elites" & could care less
um, YOU did not know this. #laughable #ImWithHer
and I am thinking that you would save the world

Russia invaded Georgia during Bush, why does Bush get a pass on this? #DumbDonald
- first, wrong use of "so called."  Second, ok, the first is still too funny. @HillaryClinton @POTUS - look, DonJ has a map
lol well if I recall you didn't know this when speaking about Russia & Ukraine.
You didn't know. There is video footage of you not knowing. I'm getting concerned about your mental state. #LoserDonald

Well you didn't know it just a month ago. I don't think you should get a free pass.

Truth is the Trump way. Media is bias and now we all see it.

He was sitting on his skinny ass in the White House which is really our house. it belongs to the people
#HILLARY TOLD OBAMA "IF I GO DOWN/U GO DOWN TOO"! THEN #BILL SAID "IF HILLARY  GO TO JAIL/I WILL KILL EVERYONE"!   #THREATS?
And why don't you bring that UP in debate ( or ever )! How he sat back and let it happen to our " NATO ALLY" March 14, 2014
@KatrinaPierson  YOU.  YOU DIDNT KNOW THIS.  #fraud #liar
you didn't know this...you....in an interview. You didn't know. I'm glad you did your homework and know now.
trump'll fix this, cause he's so great at making deals ya know. it'll be so great, it'll make your head spin.... and shit
@realDonaldTrump
No. "Russia took Crimea" is globalist bullshit. Crimeans voted to leave Ukraine and re-join Russia. Self determination.

@mike_pence "national disgrace” and an “international pariah" Colin Powell on Trump. GOP leaders see the evil of Trump
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS! Amazing how you walk back everything you say and do!
How you can be so bold as to say this when you're on tape not knowing it is beyond me.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjpGfjzheeo …
uh, YOU didn't know it, that's who
when Obama fights for Hi_LIAR-y.. he shatters his legacy into millions of pieces! He shows NO CARE of 50% Americans!
you...didn't know this.
you didn't know it.
was so funny when you said you get most your foreign policy info and insights from reading mags like Time and the Enquirer
Russia took Crimea and set-up protection for Ukraine when Landlocked- Eastern. Europe., Ukraine threatened by ISIL! Smart.
You.  RT @realDonaldTrump: Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn’t know this and why does Obama get a free pass?
Russia taking Crimea is more proof that Putin is smarter and stronger than Obama
Trump to release medical records immediately following Melania's press conference about her immigration to US. @KailiJoy
#MAGA
actually Russia didn't take. It annexed. Which means it claimed it for its own.
Russia didn't take Crimea. Crimea joined Russia. There is a difference
because he get a freak'en pass on everything he does #mainstreammediasucks
BARRY SOTORO NEEDS TO MEET ITS (ITS) MAKER ASAP!  AN EXECUTION OF ITS FLESH IS TIMELY, NEEDING TO BE DONE, & AWAITED!
Because he's black and if someone calls him what he is...a spineless socialist destroying this country. They'd be "racist".
That's easy.  Obama didn't want to be President for the duties involved.  Just wanted to be called President.  No care.
If Hillbillary can call us deplorables. Cant we call her supporters Shit Stains? I personally love the idea.

#Donocchio stays upset at the media calling out his lies.

He was treated disrespectfully by China and Philippines recently.
If you studied piano, you might be able to transform your anger into useful, positive energy.
why are you not putting the blame where it belongs? On Putin. Oh yeah, you love Putin!

... but why would phi-slamma-jamma-obamma start working now. He has never had to "work" a day in his life.
The PRESIDENT does not rule the planet  Did you expect him to start WW3 and detonate nuclear weapons? Not Putin or Un.
Well, when asked, and it's on video, you didn't know it, you ignorant moron! You're really scared now, huh?
Dont forget Bill interview about Hillarys health ... it is not the first time she collapsed.

YOU didn't KNOW this!!!
you clearly didn't know it...
your right on a lot of stuff.
what would you have done differently?
Trump says Putin is 'not going to go into Ukraine,' despite Crimea @CNNPolitics http://cnn.it/2ajgHSh 
You have to be the President of the United States. History claims it.
Only because their was no support from the U.S. led by HOUSANE OBAMA.
Why are you concerned about Crimea when you're the one sucking Putin's cock?
#Crimea vote to join #Russia, LEGALLY. #Putin is too busy for #Russia's success to invade wherever
Crimean matters are for #Crimea's people to decide, not idiot puppets from America's vassal states. Thank God.  
Russia for you , Mr. Trump

Release your tax returns.
