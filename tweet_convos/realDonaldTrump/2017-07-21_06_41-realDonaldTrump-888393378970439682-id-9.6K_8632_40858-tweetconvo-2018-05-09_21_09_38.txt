How many manufacturing jobs have left New England in the last 50 yrs from bad trade agreements @NewportLost @RIRepublicans
My town in MA, deader than dead. Was shoe & fabric manufacturing dominant 
I grew up when RI had traffic because of tourism. 
Not any more
Come south of the tower and visit my neck of the woods. Madness all summer long..
I'm down the street, stop lyin
What's down the street?
Me in Newport and this is not the tourism we had in the 90's.
My first time in 32 years ever seeing East Matunuck Beach sold out every day since Memorial Day.

As a Trump voter I really don't give a damn that Trump textiles are made over seas, clothing and fabric aren't produced in America anymore

And workers employed from various counties that are not America. #MAGA
tu t'ennuie le vieux
It's awake. Brace for more twitterhea.
And you were made in Russia.
No new American jobs at Mar A Lago though, foreigners only right? Hypocrite!
Your merchandise is not #MadeInAmerica

Trump merchandise is made overseas
Democrats are bought and paid for by China and Russia.
Unless its your products....right??!
Shade in America is more like it.

I wouldn't want Comey looking at me
Let's start with what is NOT made in America: Your ties, Ivanka's anything, your family's money. And here you go wanting to flap your gums
except for you and Ivanka's clothing lines right. Cause those are made in chinese sweat shops
You should make a gif that says "Jailed in America" you fu**ing TRAITOR. I can't wait until you go down & I don't mean on Putin!

I kick myself every day because I voted for you. You're a liar, a fraud and mentally unhinged @POTUS. #VoterRemorse #TakeAmericaBack
Please join us & #resist. Call ur reps, talk to Trump friends, vote blue til Republicans remember decent hardworking ppl
Most of the things Trump lent his name to weren't made in America, as this awkward Letterman clip can attest
Everything u buy isn't made n  US. U people r hypocrites. & it's b/c our leaders b4 Trump have crippled our country. DT trying 2 get it back
And how many of his shitty products are made overseas? Hint: a lot.
Who's products. Since we were forced 2 buy then b/c of our economic state. Have 2 stay competitive. 2 run a company. Former leaders fault.
DT working w/other countries2 make it right again.They've created a mess 4 him.So their pockets got fatter.& now their scared.
That's y he's being attacked n so many angles. & getting push back. Seems so obvious 2 me. & I'm nobody but a mother & wife.
America supports you 100%, let them physically try to take you out of office and see what happens when 62 million PLUS protect you #MAGA
...wrong, America supports Donald Trump by 35%, the other 65% wants him in jail.
And those who support him dont care.  Chew on that
They care don't worry they care
Not the thousands on my twitter
As you wish I hope it never comes to it!
Me either bloodshed on both sides
More like Irrational Exuberance
Made in Russia 
What??????
Good business to reduce cost to all consumers. Pass The Fair Tax and nearly every company of consequence will HQ and manufacture here USA.
Except for your sh**

Mr. Trump, none of your products or your daughter's have EVER been made in America.
How many Trump brand goods are made overseas?
I missed you saying how many of the Trump-branded products you will stop making abroad and start making in America.
Liar LOVE OBAMA
It is great to have made in America but does America own any of its technology? Or does it have to license it all?
Made in "GYNA"
Here's a thought.. maybe you and Ivanka could think about having some of your clothing lines and other consumables made here for a change!
Why is none of your crap ever made in America?
Your family should trying making some things in America and maybe hiring a few American workers
Why is all yours and Ivanka's merchandise made every where else,  but the USA.  Way to support America.  Hippocrates!  #worstPresidentEver
Everything is better American made........except your wives? @realDonaldTrump #absoluterubbish
False again. How many lies are you up to now? 5/day?

To hell with tax returns, I would like to see POTUS take an IQ test.
