Why would we take advice from a reality star?
Cause he's not a liar and truly wants the best for all who live legally in this country.
Just because you stand in a garage doesn't make you a car!
You trust her? I dont, terrorism will get worse with her policies.
As a private citizen, Trump just sues anyone who disagrees with him. So, no record!!!
He's a successful  business man and he will make America great again.
Diana, just in case you didn't see this:
Sorry, I don't believe her.
because you're a freakin crazy person

you people are unhinged just like Don the Con An embarrassment to this great nation

how are you tweeting during your debate?
the deplorables are doing it for him lol
shut the fuck up. you are fucking obsessed. none of these candidates are good.
you're guys going down We knew he couldn't debate LOL
your standards must be very low
@sandyslove @HillaryClinton Why does she need 5 days off to prepare for a debate when she doesn't hold rally's? #NoStamina
@MDavidMorris2 She was well rested and prepared. I thought Trump missed on a lot of opportunities. Steven K Bannon. Horrible job
Everything Bannon touches turns to gold.
He sure played a huge part in Trump's campaign victory. No question..
I've listened to him every day for 3 hours on Sirius radio until he took a leave to head up Trump's campaign.When he got to #1
Yep me too.  Perhaps Chief of staff? Hasn't returned as planned.
He wouldn't say anything for sure today. He wouldn't say one word  I know he belongs helping Trump but I'll miss him #5
Indeed...
I'm w/H. She's done so much more GOOD than your snake oil, exaggerated, good 'ol boy crap can EVER match.
And weren't you a DEM in those 30 years? What color is your cauldron? Probably not black.
I don't believe that you even know the difference between FACT and OPINION. Probably forgot 50 years ago.
But Donald seriously, why would we take advice from you??  Help avoid paying taxes or file for bankruptcy!
.@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton God I got the sniffles. I keep interrupting to take attention away from my stifles.

it's funny watching her trying to be funny. She's obnoxious
If Hillary cared about low income America she wouldn't resettle 600k Syrian refugees in their neighborhoods.

@realDonaldTrump 
#MAGA
apologies for my mean-spirited RT earlier. I deleted. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by your Syrian refugee neighbors.
SHUT UP @HillaryClinton

That is an outright lie as she kept crossing to his side which is not done during a debate.She such a liar
go over there and shut her down!  Annoying!
I feel sorry for the loved ones of your supporters. Living with a racist can't be easy. #NeverTrump #ClownTrain #DumpTrump

Donald, are you smart enough to be in the debates?

Pity you can't debate as well as Pence.  He should be in your slot, not you.
its your mouth that is rigged,Poor(as in not very rich) Trump
has been fake tanning for 30 years. Why would we take policy advice from him?
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........
Hillary spent decades living on tax payers money~tax dollars paid by people in jobs you created~then she turned 2 foreign $
Need to mention Hati. How her foundation robbed the poor poverty stricken people of hati
I don't like paying federal taxes because I don't want one penny going for abortions!
and you have ZERO political experience. why should we take it from you?
Those 30 years she was working under an authority including R presidents, Now with her, we will go high
she is older and trying to get in to heaven? Naw just power and $$ hungry remember her and bill r broke???
why would anyone take policy advice from you?
You go get her @realDonaldTrump

WHY NOT SHOW THE DAMN TAX RETURNS MR BIGSHOT MR BIGMONEY MR BIGLIAR
You've been a corrupt bankrupt to stiff people while being wealthy racist sexist white male for 70 years.
will be in jail before November 8 @HillaryClinton
DC?  I always though everyone was more Marvel.  @HillaryClinton would be Captain America and you'd be Mole Man.
@louiselloyd3 @HillaryClinton She also rigged the debate.

I'd much rather take policy advice from @HillaryClinton , she hasn't spent her life using the "laws" to build her wealth
Cuba @HillaryClinton
your such a cry baby douche bag trump liar theif
Medusa Trump you have been rigging the government  with your business
"how do you feel about national security? ---Well I wouldn't read classified emails on a private server. #DebateAdvice
Hillary has so many errors, when asked a question in next debate no matter the subject reference 1 of those mistakes.
in the next debate stress Benghazi and her "what does it matter comment" since she brought up your old comments. #Trump
Because she knows where all the glasses are in the White House kitchen already.
you bankrupted your own company 6 times..why would we let you bankrupt America?
and you've been a part of NO system for any amount of time, why should we take policy advice from you?
Russia rigging it for Trump  @HillaryClinton
Drumpf's policies would be terrible for America.
Hillary signaling Lester debate-https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjmN_hIkTQ&feature=player_embedded …
Donald please acknowledge the five republicans who have decided to back you. Especially George Bush. Not to late to be
Buying media won't help lady, Millions of Deplorables have chosen their leader already.

#Debates2016
Correct, some people need to hear that old jargon to make them happy.
Trump for President! Who wants another corrupt, deceitful and lying politician in DC! Trump doesn't do pay for play!!
because just like u failed plenty of times. At lease she pays her taxes
You've been beneficiary of the "rigged" financial system for at least as long. #silverspoon #ritchierich #faker

#CrookedHillary gets her policy positions decreed to #her by her #Donors
#HesWithMe
#ShesWithWallStreet
#MAGA
Rigged: CNN Poll Claiming Hillary Won the Debate Sampled 41% Democrats Compared to 26% Republicans
funny thing is only 26% Republicans included & Trump got 27%  #TrumpWon #TrumpPence16
Better for her than a con man.
@njgop1 @HillaryClinton Why should we take any policy advice from you? #Debates2016
says the man participating in "the rigging"...
#TrumpSniffles Don does cocaine. #trumpzanidiot
As opposed to the King of Bankruptcy?
hillary has no good advice and never did have any good advice.
el mejor y el fuerte  bien dicurso asi es Donald trump
She hasn't been in DC for 30 years. You're really bad at math.
Good grief Don
Hillary Crooked represents the continuity of American corruption.
the debate sucked. You are better than that. Stay away from your personal success. Attack her lies
Mr. Trump, you did an excellent job last night. You were a gentleman. Assertive. Patient.  Hillary sucks
Trump snorting and jerky body movements could have come from cocaine.  Sad!
I wouldn't.
Yes @HillaryClinton's "advice" is worthless so: 

#WeThePeople are preparing your New House for you Mr. #Trump!
In 1986, Hillary was First Lady of Arkansas, not part of D.C. at all.  Where do  you get this crap?
HRC is the lump that remains in the sifter, sifting flour
*DJT is the cream that rises to the top.
Donnie, it's too early to start explaining why you lost.
We wouldn't! #TrumpWon #debate #MAGA
WHY TAKE ECONOMIC ADVISE FROM U, MR.TRUMP?  A DISMAL RECORD OF BANKRUPSIES, SCREWING CREDITORS, BRIBARY,...
You've be giving to candidates for over 60 years, you are the system.
Hillary has never met a payroll in the private sector. Who is she to give business advice? #ccot
We are in so much debt how can Obama keep giving other countries money?
Because she knows what she's talking about, unlike you. @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
she showed off a face well prepared w/ a Hollywood make-over but she will never do gov't make-over! Never!
advantage of the misfortune of citizens, oh yess, of course, getting your business to bankruptcy.
the question here's what have you been doing in those same 30 years? Stealing money from students, taking
Hillary made Trump talk about taxes last night instead of focusing on what she’s done wrong. Let’s change it next debate
This debate shown who had the better stamina...Clinton 2016!!!
Great performance!!
remember she is defective  has soooo many lies on her,just talk about them
@MonsterBehr @HillaryClinton #ForeignPolicyExperienceFails
She Watched Them Die In Real Time,Then Plotted The Video Lie To Cover BO s ass 4 reelection
at least she still has functioning brain cells. Can't say the same for you.
you can't take anything with your little hand's
FYI Donald you actually look like you're out of your character and category
why would anyone take advice from someone who doesn't care enough to prepare for a debate? #NeverTrump
I agree. I'm voting for you.
Because we can't trust you. Get over yourself & pay taxes. The star of your political career is birtherism.
Excellent point! Keep emphasizing that one.
#realdonaldtrump why would I take advice from someone who uses people,  didn't pay them n abuses ANY system
why would we take yours? You don't know anything about the government.
you have participated in that rigged system for just as long #liartrump
you should have said that last night. Oh well, we still won. Onward we go. #TrumpPence2016
Well if the Clintons get back in2 power it is free willy 4 Billy looking 4 another internship  lest we 4get
You just said it, Mr. Circus Peanut. Can't wriggle your way out of the fool you made of yourself this time, all on record
she did nothing for all that http://time.You  should've brought up Bill's disrespect for women! What could she say?
Trump is flat out nuts
Anyone who Took policy advice from her would be considered certifiable!!!
What changes did u want her to make, that Bushs, Reagan, Clinton & Obama didn't make. She worked w/them.
because 1 woman can't be blamed for not moving mountains when it required cooperation from over 100 people
is not healthy to lead great America she's suffering from epileptic syndrome America be warned
Didn't your people this is about appearances?  Canned lawyer speak looks better on tv. D.C. Is run by lawyers

because @HillaryClinton has been fighting for middle class instead of billionaires like u
DT, you've paid off crooked ppl to keep things rigged all these years so you wouldn't have to pay taxes.
The Fed under Obama intentionally tried to make wealthy wealthier to get trickle down effect.1st part done
Bernanke in 2010 speech said intent of QE was to boost market, make wealthy wealthier and trickle down.
Hillary and Chelsea are worth millions and have never produced a product or service.
and YOU have used the system to line your pockets, you currently use campaign funds to PAY YOURSELF! HYPOCRITE!!! #LOSER
Ummm. Because SHES smart. She does her homework. She knows what she talking about.
you have headlined your own crooked system even longer than that.  Makes you even more dangerous.
Because she knows what she is talking about
#SickHillary is a professional politician NOT a leader, she is 2 weak

Our Loyal #PresidentTrump will #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton

@BraendeyMolson @HillaryClinton. U rite.
why would we take advice from a serial bankruptcy scammer like you?
Donnie, the kids want you to be president so they can take over your business they think you went goofy
Big Don, that 400lb guy hacking into the dnc is your dog Christie
Boss, don't let them look up the Android your fans love your tweets at 0300.
fearless grandlizard drumpfenfuhrer Hill baited you & you looked like a huge orange blowfish on the hook
i trust her more than u
trust me, corruption helped you not get fucked up by Bernie tonight. Somehow, you have a fighting chance.
you've been bankrupt several times & sued many more.  Why should we take advice from you Trumplestiltskin?
Good point. Perhaps we should also say the same about your involvement in rigged corporatism.
ayuda clave (Chicago) Rahm Emanuel dirigió Freddie Mac
Hillary continuación, se benefició de los rescates federales de los bancos.
rigged for liberal politicians yes.
The debate was rigged in favor of crooked.
while you were busy doing what? avoiding social diseases was your "personal Vietnam"?
Because Lying Don The Con has none.
Proud of our Future President tonight! Everyday he gets up & fights for us! It feels so good 2 see &feel his love4 America!
vote @HillaryClinton because she at least has a brain. It's a start.
@faagifts @HillaryClinton  exactly  . All she can advise on is murder, money and mayhem.
and you are the better choice? You tell a lie every 3 minutes!
because it's better than taking advice from u 
@sme4201968 @HillaryClinton  noone of sane thought would
This is what it comes down to.
#russianagentorange, I truly believe you are an anomaly.  American people are great. U will lose huge.
Because Hillary Clinton knows the law and has had actual experience making public policies?
She's smarter than you are @HillaryClinton
You never served as even Hall Monitor!
I don't want any of her failed policies.. she's a disgrace
Because she actually understands the intricacies of writing good public policy. When was the last time you did that?
Everything is rigged, nothing new!! Brush up on your political history Trump!! It's always been that way.
You tell us - you've been hobnobbing with the Clintons for all those years! @realDonaldTrump @eavesdropann @HillaryClinton
