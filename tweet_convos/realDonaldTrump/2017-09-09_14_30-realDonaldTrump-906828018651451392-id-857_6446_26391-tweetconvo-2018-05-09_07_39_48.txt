Why can't the country stand together always, not just in a crisis.
We can and do, but the MSM promotes a divisive narrative that keeps us at odds...
Yeah... It's just the media... Not the administration at all...
You're right, the MSM and the Obama administration. Thanks for pointing that out!
Obama never whined when conservatives harassed him.  Trump whines like a toddler throwing a tantrum.
He was too busy stealing our money.  Trump is busy making us great again, he can complain about negative attacks, Presidents get a bunch.
Evidence to your ridiculous claims?
What LAPD AND CAIR DID TO A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
Right on.

Please don't Forget to thank the wives also!
Thank you!
From Florida we love ALL First Responders...  GOD BLESS Them!
If y'all need housing, food or laundry in the TAMPA area, please reach out & our community will do all we can!!
Just remember, Trump pledged money ($1,000,000)to Sandy victims too. They never received it either.
LOL, that's all he ever did! Snark and blame the previous admin.
You are always in our prayers
is the trump pussy bus??
Way to go NYPD you are the best
They look a better lot than the scum looters! Good ppl helping, Scum looting.
#ThankYou
Trump retweets this, yet didn't lift a finger to help fellow New Yorkers. Surprising? No. Just more hypocrisy
This is one more thing I love about America.... Great Americans 
Thank you @NYPD 
For being great Americans helping your neighbors
Thank you for your service
Good luck
Our fellow countryman will always come first. God Belss NYPD.Those who oppose like kaepernick, and those NFL players who follow, go to hell
Many except for many in the GOP
nice
Thanks
You should be ashamed for not acknowledging offers of help or just well wishes. You have no heart.
You are a pompous ass! You could care less about the American people. Especially people who have been victims of the devastating hurricanes

I told u so: Our kids #SoldOut
Donald Trump's Congressional Deputy Trades DACA Amnesty for Tax Cuts, Not Border Wall http://bit.ly/2wYDzTM 
A lot of Canadians came down and are coming down again, but you're trying to screw us with #NAFTA, what gives?
@realDonaldTrump see, this is Americans helping Americans for no financial gain,Donnie. Take notes on how humans act. #TrumpResign
Many @gop denied NY and NJ disaster relief funds after Sandy

Proud of you all!!
You can tell the difference between the budgets of the NYPD and the FDNY.


They aren't white Europeans, they qualify 4 affirmative action
DACA makes new class of people, beating our kids not on merit but 'diversity'

Our whole life we were taught to not have babies unless we can afford them,meanwhile we pay for our replacements
#DC https://twitter.com/NetworksManager/status/854688670892388352 …

50% of all babies in US are born on Medicaid.
Hard working Americans are paying for other people's babies.
#IceRaids 

What happened to this guy we elected? To saving Americans, giving our kids something to dream about?
#DACA #MAGA #DC 
Someone take your phone there, 45? Lots of #RETWEETing going on now!
Nice you are going to help, BUT, since the fbi seems to be covering up PizzaGate how about you guys going public?
White supremacists in uniform
We have the best NYPD in the world and they are always there to help. In spite of the Communist Mayor we got. Who voted for him????
Thank you for all you do! They are heroes, every police officer in out great nation is with the way hey risk their own lives every day.

God bless them and keep them safe in the Name of Jesus Amen
Yeah, too bad that Horseshit scam setup-tragedy Sandyhook was a few days later. Sandyhook NJ was Sandy ground zero That kid didnt do it all.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  This is already a stressful time as we go about cleaning up after Irma and your presence is welcome.
Thank you
Too bad the @GOP didn't want to help out with #Sandy .
Its great to see humanity banding together now. To preempt future crises, we have to band together against the cause: Climate Change.

Thank you, NYPD. I NY!! What are YOU doing, Donald? You.
They also came south to Texas during Hurricane Harvey.  Saw some of them at a restaurant and thanked them with a hug.
@realDonaldTrump A member of the Russian legislature just admitted publicly that Russian Intelligence got #trump elected. #resign
Thank you NYPD you rock!
Thank you to all the men and women who helped with Harvey and Irma victims. Thank you @POTUS for getting the funding needed to rebuild. 
Hate your mayor but respect to nypd and nyfd. God bless.
Funny how quickly they forget that the TEXAS senators voted AGAINST the aid bill for those affected by Sandy. But their hands are out now!
Godspeed, Ladies & Gentlemen.
Thank you ny we love and support you in Texas.  Stick together or fall apart.
And here we see the Black Lies Matter caravan making its way south to help those black lives that matter.
#thankyou #ny #fl
God bless you. Be safe.
Real tragedy is in USVI and BVI folks.  FL is a joke compared to the destruction there.

OMG! I am so proud. My New York!
NEW YORK IS ON THE WAY! MY LOVE TO YOU GUYS and I KNOW THE BEST OF HELP IS ON THE WAY. 
All good men doing what they can to help those in need. So happy to see people with so much kindness and care.
What about the thousands of other communities sending assistance to those impacted by Harvey and Irma? They don't get recognized?

We remember everyone we lost on 9/11 and honor all who defend our country and our ideals. No act of terror will ever change who we are.
Trump's company enters major golf course deal with China gov't http://nydn.us/2xVN7fU   As I keep profiting from my business as POTUS.
Mexico offered their help too!
How do you report someone who charges money for drug trafficking and who came to the United States illegally and then legalized for money?
How I choose to think creates my experience. I build each moment within the private recesses of my own mind.
The NHC don't know, how they can interconnect with #Irma & #Jose & change them in category 2.
Let's see, how I changed this in category 2. 
Not like last nights political show on bashing President Trump via the Miss America contest.
It's good to hear and see this country coming together.

Trump is last person who should salute first responders- he took 9/11 money for himself-#zeromoralauthority -  I was this was not true!!
After 9/11, Trump Took Money Marked for Small Businesses http://tws.io/2gXpMqS  via @WeeklyStandard
Yeah and what are you doing where did your donation go??????
TY TY TY...Ur Love & Strength are Felt & Appreciated
Donald Trump and the Republicans wanted to withhold funds until they found somewhere else to cut. Un-Human Reasoning. Heartless Politics.
Why isn't anyone worried about hurricane Jose? It's about to hit the east coast of Florida soon
Father God You are able to shut down this hurricane, call on all Angels
Al Gore warned climate change would make hurricanes worse, so why didn't we listen?
Donald Trumps eighth world-wide: Clean coal.
P100ppppp
How many "my way or the highway" Texans showed up to help Sandy victims?? they are weird selfish people
Hey tRUMP,  New York hates you. So does 75% of the county!  
Isnt this the local Gov and Coast gaurd job?? sending gov thugs? for what?
How long did the people of Katrina wait for help?
Too late to kiss up, Trump.  Most NY residents despise you as a "Fake President" and real con man.  No hurricanes in Russia, traitor!

Stunning video: Cops rescue two people attempting to ride out Hurricane Irma on a boat https://susanorji.blog/2017/09/11/stunning-video-cops-rescue-two-people-attempting-to-ride-out-hurricane-irma-on-a-boat/ … via @wordpressdotcom
