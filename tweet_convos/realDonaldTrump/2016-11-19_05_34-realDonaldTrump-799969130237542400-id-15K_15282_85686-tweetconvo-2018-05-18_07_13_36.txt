You are STILL a fraud and a con man.
looks photo chopped to me..
no shit
How noble.
good move
Bullshit!!!
Great start Mr President. Can I get a job. Maybe just be your buddy and get paid good. Let me know Buddy
figured as much. Sometimes its just easier to pay and move on
you're gonna be so great @widerider
I settled because I was totally guilty.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING - THE JUDGE WAS OUT TO GET YOU & WUDN'T DELAY TRIAL - AT THANKSGIVING NO LESS -- BAD, EVIL JUDGE!
#MAGA
You made the right choice. America first!
Congrats on committing fraud and buying your way out of jail. I guess. Hell, I dunno.
but you would be ok with crooked Hillary being President? And releasing classified information to our enemies?
Yep. That's EXACTLY what I said. You're right. I should feel good about this. He even shortchanged them. Solid.
in fairness, he settled a lawsuit. He didn't shortchange if it was the amount required
His words, not mine.

tbh doesn't sound like a shortchange. Sounds like they got what they wanted
Again, his words. And I think the focus should be more on the "fraud" part, no?
I call B.S.
Your arrogance is just breathtaking!
did I detect that the @realDonaldTrump may not be on your Christmas card list?
Whatever makes you think that !! @realDonaldTrump
I'm thinking that someone as intelligent, sexy and beautiful as you knows her stuff about plonkers like the @realDonaldTrump
You sending me up?!?!? @realDonaldTrump
was pulling your bell after your comment t'other day 
Sod you then ... 
I'll take the beautiful and sexy bit!!!!

And YOU LOST!
Fake “University” that the fake president created.
thank you mr president.. We know you love our country !
Pussygrabber was guilty of fraud. Paid up like a little bitch. Right Don the Con?
behold look at all these fools talking bad & down on you they are jealous haters they wish they could be like DONALD TRUMP!
I love you man, but you should have left out the "small fraction" comment.  Leaves you open to criticism & hate
You'll soon find out that running the government would be much easier without your band of bigots. @realDonaldTrump
Haters gonna #HATE
"I never settle"
country comes first
crooked
<gag>
#NotMyPresident
it's was a bogus lawsuit by a bunch if crybaby assholes just like the ones protesting. I understand u did what u had to!
I completely understand.   Of course there is others who don't.  You shut the whiners up...good!
barf. You're a criminal
I got this GET OVER IT
I'll get over it when his supporters stop painting swastikas in my neighborhoods playgrounds.
You can't be serious well ill never know but he's our President elect nothings changing now

Ok fuck you seems like all day i had to deal with insults Direspect people calling me Racist plus more.Your BLOCKED
you can start acting presidential anytime

.@realDonaldTrump good job triggering CNN liberals. HRC surrogates @BrianStelter/@JakeTapper having on-air seizures
I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
I know trolling when I see it and this is some presidential level trolling.
u did the rite thing
W

Your Excellency sir, 
Congratulations on that move.
The nation and the world needs your attention and Care!
thank you for putting us and our country first over your U suit. That really should prove that you are for us.
you swindled them. Simple.
nothing but gold diggers
oh the martyr...

You're nothing but a fraud
And a Nazi.

Sadly, not going to happen.
someone's pessimistic
*Realistic. Trump, unfortunately, is here to stay. What Congress should do is amend/eliminate the Electoral system ASAP.
read the Constitution on how to remove the electoral college.  More than just Congress is needed
No, you're a fraud.
Also, "Trump University"? That's almost an oxymoron.
yes, the learn to English good and it makes them bigly rich lol!
still got 74 other distracting lawsuits to work through. when will u be settling those? or was this fraud one more serious?
cue the settling
4.4 million so far! wow, that's darn impressive!
would be 6.7 mill if not for a few server issues and hackers
We are already seeing positive change!  Excited for you to take office on 1-20-17 What a great day that will be for voters!
People being beaten up and violated for their beliefs is NOT positive change! #getreal #stopbeingdevisive
Perhaps you didn't read my message correctly? The voters!  The people causing harm to others didn't vote!
Really???? You know this for a fact??? Stop living in your bubble!
award -> fraud*
nothing but gold diggers explain the thousands that were happy?
I'm not the one that settled for $25m.
i’m american, sorry to tell you!
Come to Canada we wont hold that against you.. We are expecting some American Refugees
love Canada it's so quiet and beautiful.
Liar.
Liar. You didnt want to testify in court. Always the coward. Knows truth will come out!
And also maybe because you’re guilty of fraud?

Huh?? You were found guilty of fraud and ordered to pay a meager $25 million to the students you had defrauded. I guess in your twisted mind, the $25 mil was a win as u actually owed about twice that.
Creep
#TrumpFraud $25,000,000 proves guilt. Swindling innocent Americans for Trump gain. Apologize 4 #Fraud
Funny just a mo ago democrats saying Clinton's settlement with Paula Jones was not guilt.
Old news. Bill Clinton retired. Trump is President Elect and #Guilty of Fraud. #CurrentEvents
LOL. No it just demonstrates the hypocrisy of the left. Now no news coverage.
Look, you won. You can stop lying now. @realDonaldTrump
I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
yeah, and had @realDonaldTrump not said anything you would've complained he's hiding/lying about the settlement.
Uh, he *is* lying about the settlement.
Are you a plaintiff?
No, just a deeply amused spectator.
So what has he lied about re:settlement?
That he settled because he didn't have time to focus on it. He settled because it was going to be a shitshow.
okay, I understand where you are coming from.  I think it could be both.  Had he lost election he may have fought it.
it doesnot look good
because trump is on it
how many trump'a dp we need to light a bulb?
no we electricity 

Morons Are Governing America!
Poor thing, so miss understood #ImpeachTrumpNow
You are the worst negotiator ever. The other side always knows you're lying.
Now you're defrauding the United States. You can settle that one by #resigning #impeachNow
You lost because you are crook.  Can't wait for to be jailed.
You settled shit sac Bc your guilty, a con
But you're not. Dummy.
You were sued for FRAUDULENT practices. Settling a multimillion dollar lawsuit against your corrupt fake school doesn't make you presidential. It makes you guilty AF. Your ignorant base may ignore your crimes, but the rest of us won't, and neither will Comey.
You were sued for $40M.  You settled for $25M.  I don't consider more than half a "small fraction."
You settled because you were guilty of fraud and the judge was lenient.
or take the focus off of how your company stole from thousand of AMERICAN trying to live their dreams while you went Bnkrpt
"I defrauded and quickly ripped-off American citizens because I need to focus on American citizens."

Thanks for the 'inspiration', comrade. I mean jackass.
/ very thankful we have a president who puts America & our citizens ahead of his own personal challenges
And to make it go away. This is going to be so interesting to watch.
Weird, in your call with Argentinian leader, seemed like you were using office of PE to do business.
#DrainYourOwnSwampDonald !!!!

Then you should have taken care o your people that you stole from...
no because president you have influence.
thank you so much for caring. please, your lawyers kept pushing it off which gives you the sake of the USA excuse. big fail
i feel sorry for America ppl who choose you to be there champion

YOU SETTLED SO PEOPLE WOULDNT SEE YOU FOR THE PETTY DISHONEST SCAMMER YOU ARE
You don't even have the ability to realize how offensive just that statement is! Small fraction??? (cont)
This is HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but you don't even go to your daily intelligence briefings! Not serious about your job or country trump?! #flipfloptrump
#twitterpres you're a fraud and a joke
You lost!!! #GUILTY #trumpscomingchallenge #TrumpConsequences
You should not be our president.  The popular vote is with Hillary.   Not a FRAUD.
so true! Thank you for focusing on what matters...like the Hamilton cast and SNL...very presidential
count your blessings you weren't up against Bernie. Still can't believe the DNC screwed up so bad
oh ok cool
uum, yeah right.
because yo ass is guilty.
Please keep your promises to us!
That's criminal offense you should have to be in jail but this country is so stupid that the let you off every thing you d
We know. There is alot to get done. And Thank You Mr. President for running and winning. Lets get to work
agree
Rumor has it that Mr. Trump will include a copy of "Money for Nothing" to all Trump U. plaintiffs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD6Obi7Cag …
Good move, and your focus on our country is greatly appreciated!
YA DARN SKIPPY 
...... You are the worst hypocrite because you do not have a brain to run this great Country....
You agree you ripped people off for an amount of which $25mill is a small fraction. Yeah, we understand.
You admit to your own guilt with this silly and fake boasting.
Then quit crying about Hamilton.
and you should... grow some balls and stop crying like a wining baby over Saturday night.
Somehow I will get people to INSIST that you do take the lousy 400K salary since you lost alot of money for our sake.
It didn't take brain science to figure out you had to settle the case b/c timing is everything & your new job had to B 1st!
es usted un homófobo,usted no debería de ser el que represente a los americanos,ahora entiendo porque quiere ese poder
you demonstrated on the campaign trail you can't focus on what you said 10 minutes ago.
Trump now needs to settle this here racism going on in America with all these Hitler fans and he'd be in the head of them
cheated people for $25million?
You settled because you knew you were guilty of rackateering.
, You settled because you did not want to be convicted of Fraud!
Cost the taxpayers less for the guilty verdict, too!   smh...  I NEVER settle....yeah, ok.
#whereistherestofthemoney #boo
you settled because you don't have the balls to go to court. That's okay. They're small. Just like your hands. #coward
there is nothing SMALL about $25 million. Imagine the number you could have truly helped were you not CROOKED
Such as the Vets he promised to help!
or cos power corrupts and u bribed or thrtened ur way out.Ur a criminal. U belong in prison. Counting hrs til ur impeached
can you focus on the country then and stop belly-aching over Hamilton and snl?
Self-centered.
ok, Mr.  P-E.  then fire your kids, sell your assets, put them in a blind trust & focus on us. #fatchance #TrumpTransition
You do know that this tweet admits guilt?
aah, squared the rubes of your  snake oil business. How gallant of u. How bout the sex. harassment suits ? are they next ?
Settlement means Guilty of FRAUD!  Hope these people get paid.
Good move...
In other words, you've cheated those people AGAIN. You're the crooked one #notmypresident
can u settle with the rape victim too??.....#December court date COMING SOON
this is why tweeting about SNL seems absurd
you are guilty of fraud
or focus on the immediate and urgent task of tweeting against #Hamilton WE NEED A LEADER, NOT A BIG BABY,
Amen! God bless you always, you are in my prayers,  many times everyday!
if there wasn't a legitimate case, there wouldn't need to be a settlement. You just admitted guilt 
Did Bill Clinton admit to sexual assault when he paid out $850,000?
You defrauded 6000 students and now you whine about a sketch show and a theatre cast? You're pathetic.
I didn't realize it was possible to gaslight yourself.
Anyone who believes this must have graduated from Trump U with an honorary degree in being a dope. Fraudulent!
Then focus on our country instead of tweeting about Hamilton, SNL & any other random pop culture nonsense you can think of.
studying up for the decline of America. Racist know nothing bigot
You said and I quote "I never settle." But we all know you are a liar
yea right that's why you did it liar
if only everyone was as selfless as you maybe america actually would be great
YOU LIED AND LOST OUR FUTURE WITH YOU LOOKS AMAZING THANKS FATTY
Yeah right.
 I agree and believed you handled it in that way to move on and clear the slate to concentrate on the country
Liar
Yeah right, you are nothing but a con man and traitor.
PFFFFFFFFFFfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffT !!!!  Who whispered that one in your ear ?
You're amazing!
the only President-elect in our history to have lawsuits pending against him as he is elected.
what a jerk
Good judgment.
soooooo.....what are you doing on Twitter? #focus
In what world 62% of the total amount it's a small fraction? Well maybe you learned math at Trump U :)
Doesnt bother protesting innocence. Implies court would've been harsher. Fuck'sake America, this guy is brazen! #WTFUSA

wow the most presidential thing that has come out of that gaping hole in your face
.  Sure you could have won in your alternative universe.
FYI it's not OK to fleece people and sometimes there is justice.
bragging about how he ripped off Americans
#christwhatanasshole
Great jobI am very proud your President of United States
Thank you Sir. You made the right choice for the right reasons. God bless you Sir
Wouldn't have been better if there was no lawsuit?
smart move and I figured as much
yeah, that's why you settled! definitely not because you were GUILTY. you're hysterical, #CrookedDonald!
You mean the award for the victims that you defrauded?
..  how presidential... you criminal!
or on golfing or using the presidency to promote your businesses or pushing tax reform that will benefit you and your family by at least 1 Billion or trying to strip people of their healthcare or destroying the environment or...
So, you're bragging about your shrewdness after being proven fraudulent. as if your $25M payout is a moral victory? SAD!!!
No bc U knew U would go to JAIL which is where you should be.  Grow up DONALD stop tweeting crap!
and twitting...
