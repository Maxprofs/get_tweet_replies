The media feeding frenzy continues.  Only an idiot would believe anything you have to say now.
Move the embassy
Please move the embassy like you promised!!!
You can go and live in Gaza for a year with Ted Cruz and see what the Israeli government does to people in their own land. Disgusting.
Israel is a very strong ally to have
YOU treat AMERICA with DISDAIN & DISRESPECT! There is NO "America First" in your ACTIONS. Your actions say FUCK AMERICANS!!
They’ve earned the disdain and disrespect. So have you.
Here's just a gentle reminder of your own kind words, Mr President!
Resign.
2017: You divulge highly-sensitive classified intel—sourced from Israel—to an ally of Iran. #TrumpRussia

@protesting2016

在虎扑说句华莱士就被封号，在这里这么多直接骂总统的
@amandacstein what do you think of this tweet. If Israel gets stronger you won't be an anxious  anymore. Promise!!!
I believe in a free Palestine. I am a Jew for Palestine. @realDonaldTrump
so you don't believe the capital city of Israel should be Jerusalem?
you know the palestinian leaders call their people to kill as many jews. I agree for a Palest state but with peaceful leaders
And to families of terrorists killed while executing terror acts on Israelis. Don't want my tax $ to support that activity
The $221M should not go to Palest.as they use money to pay hansom stipends to terrorist w/bloody hands in Israel jails...
It is unfair to people who voted for you based on what you promised.Very disappointing you change course now.UNFAIR !!!!!!!
Remember Israel halted settlement construction for 10 months in past-did not move peace process forward a SMIDGEN !!!!
Settlements are not the problem-unwilling Pales.to recognize the Jewish state is.Can't have peace w/thos who wnt to kill yu
but what
Congratulations Mr. Trump drain the swamp, I  stand behind you in building the wall between us and Mexico. And maybe Canada
Looking forward to the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem!
Peace is the only possible impediment to Israel expanding its border to the Jordan River.
Please help them POTUS They are trying to destroy them hurry please.
I'm waking up feeling so optimistic about our country now. Thank you for sacrificing your privacy, money, and time for me.
agree , but we need to hold Israel accountable for atrocities they impart on their neighbors. Work towards democratic peace
Praying for you Sir! No it's not going to be easy but you can do all things through Christ Jesus!
I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse;     Genesis 12:3
amen
@RebeccaLambb Mr President Trump,  please don't forget about Israel
STOP GIVING ISREAL OUR MONEY...AMERICA NEEDS BETTER SCHOOLS, ROADS AND BRIDGES, AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. HELP US FIRST.
im sure most of us in USA love to hear this" bomb middle east and save Israeli"
@Truth_Bombers Would be terrific for you to have Israel's BACK. No one else does! Obama threw Israel to the WOLVES
AMERICANS VOTED FOR HIM!!!!, don't blame him blame your fellow man!!!!
Give me $38B in aid while allow me to have illicit nuclear weapons & you can show as much disdain as you like.
Hopefully the new President will mention on 20th the steps he will take to right Obama's wrongs toward Israel
Most of time yu act almost like yu hv Bipolar after reading a Tweet based on ur crazy Responses ..Dang grow up
yes, and amen, amen, amen
u r wrong DT.
Don't make the same mistake. we should not take sides.
Rather be a broker for both countries.
Amen  thank you Mr. President
"such total disdain" god you are a bacon
this is not going to work. To be an honest broker, you must be seen to be fair - like you always demand to be treated!
@protesting2016  Interesting combination the Nazi Party coming to power and the Jewish nation
@protesting2016
@protesting2016
Israel CREATED by UN in 1948.  Been trying to seize more "living room" ever since.  Same "reason" Adolph used for Poland.
Israel should not be breaking the law and building on lands that don't belong to them. There are bigger problems.
You let US be treated that way with the people you're planning to staff. What's another country's plight to you?
The past Obama 8yrs have been bad for peaceful Israel. It's horrible. He tried to bring them down on their knees but failed
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @voxdotcom
I'm shocked too considering we're into  murdering muslim babies, figured it would keep us close. Work on it please.
REALLY ?
http://newobserveronline.com/israeli-illegal-settlements-facts/ …
right. Because you're such a friend of the Jews?
Leave it to Donald Trump to support a country that commits genocide.
support Israel forever.
#Congress now needs to reaffirm commitments to #Israel made by #PresidentBush on 14 April 2004
#Congress on way to restoring #America's international reputation and prestige by overwhelmingly passing H.Res.11
what about Israel disrespecting and treating America and Americans? @realDonaldTrump
Bullshit. UN Resolution 1345 involved #Kosovo. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1345 … @realDonaldTrump @seanspicer @CNN
President Obama playing Islamic satanic roles for defeating Israel. Remove all Muslims out to Indonesia.
if Israel is so upset ask them if we can have the 4 billion of our tax $$ back Obama gave them!
I now think different about  Palestinians after today. They team with Isis. And is truck killing innocent people.
thanks to you and your family for hanging on there
As long as they ignore the ruling about not building settlements in the West Bank, they will be treated with distain.
ISREAL CANNOT BUILD SETTLEMENTS ON PALESTINIAN LAND !! Period !!
@TeamTrump IThink you are so right Israel is are friend we need not be disrespectful .I stand with Israel and the USA
God bless Israel.
Israel is not a person. You know that right?
they don't need aid from america
A great friend is faithfull, wise, just, & helps himself & his friends to be like that & not to disdain & disrespect others

You'll fix it like all the other disasters Obama has brought to bear.MAGA
If you want to be the force for change u claim 2 b then u will cut all ties with Israel. Stop letting them run our country.
Stop the war. Remember Dar Fur??? Did those people EVER GET HELP??No!Just fought over oil and ignored the ethnic cleansing.

Thank you PEOTUS, we love Israel and want it to continue in peace and prosperity.
thank you Mr. President for being a good friend of Israel, for Americans like my wife and myself we cherish Israel

I think you should reinstate the draft  and make the illegal s  join and serve our great country
who ever was responsible for disconnecting Isreal from the USA should be held Accountable 
DTS
, but.......................................................................................................................
you lost track of history a bit. Not treated with disdain. Treated with golden gloves. If there is such a thing. Or white.
Israel is a terrorist state! No victim! Please stop funding them to commit genocide of Palestinians!
oh, what does your cabinet appointee have to say?
my name is bonnie and i sent you 2 letters to fla, did you read them or throw away
well thats what the Bible says, and putins country is in the Bible to want to talk let me know might benefit you

Revelations 6;9 God will make Synagogue of Satan among those who falsely claim to be JEWS!
BUT, fuck the Palestinians? They're called Palestinians for a reason. Palestine???????????
Now when they behave shittily some people are calling them on it. Outrageous and presidential to point that out. Idiot
a great friend as in we as America is either her Father or Mother.
God will make your administration successful Mr. Trump and America GOD'S OWN COUNTRY great again as you support Israel.
Now they will again. @alaskantexanQCT

Make Israel the 51st state of the United States and this will end the problems.
They are doing like the nazis did against the JEWS
#ISRAEL THE VERY BEST TERRORIST SCHOOL!

Israel is such a good friend that they started a middle-east nuclear arms race and then dictated American foreign policy.
they deserve disdain,contempt everything they have done in Palestine is disdainful!isn't it Mr Donald j Trump
u have great friendship with the real terrorists Israel who have killed thousands of innocents that is real terrorism
good
38 billion dollars is hardly "total disdain". In fact, Israel is top beneficiary of US foreign aid. Think!
Why be surprised? Everything Obama's done screams "crypto-muslim". He's the "manchurian candidate" in America. A Kenyan!!
You will have a great connection and meeting with the Israel leader.  Stay close to Dolan and Pope Francis ok
Palestinians homeland was etched out by the UN, in 1922 & 1947 [Jordan] [British Mandates] politicians do not know history.
God brought them back out of 102 nations in our times [Psalms 102:16 Amos 9:14:15] to await the soon coming Messiah Jesus !
Genesis 12:3 I will bless them who bless them[Israel] and will curse them who curse them. [This promise still stands w/God]
America is still w/ Israel. it is UN & BO not 4 them. they have ulterior motive. checkout what UN ppl believe in
we have been GREATER friends he's a greedy bastard
Get them out of our politics. Netananyu is under criminal investigation. Distance yourself!
