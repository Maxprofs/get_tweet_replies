.@realdonaldtrump we expect your investigation to begin with your Chief Strategist, who's registered in FL and NYC http://nym.ag/2ktzfCJ 
Will Trump begin his "VOTER FRAUD" investigation within the White House? He should. http://bit.ly/2k0lHl7 
Guess who else is registered to vote in two different states? Someone a lot closer to Trump than Stephen Bannon. http://bit.ly/2ktNyXP 
Guess who else is registered to vote in two states? http://cnn.it/2k0QYo2 
Ding ding ding, here's another person close to Trump who's registered to vote in two states: http://wapo.st/2j90GFC 
And we've got another one, put it on the board! @PressSec Sean Spicer is also registered to vote in two states. http://wapo.st/2j9mv8c 
proves his point knumbnuts
it proves that his campaign is hypocritical and corrupt, and wasn't elected via popular mandate, certainly.
.@realDonaldTrump I think you're confusing #VoterFraud with #ElectionFraud—something your buddy @kriskobach1787 is a wizard at! #Crosscheck
.@realDonaldTrump is going to use the myth of #VoterFraud to purge more inconvenient voters from the rolls in preparation for 2018 and 2020!
should look in his own office -
Neo-Nazi & White Supremacist Bannon is giving Trump crackpot conspiracy theories.
Bring it on. We know that the number of illegal votes is negligible. We have nothing to fear here.
in the process maybe you'll accidentally fix our outdated voter roll process and make it easier for everyone to vote!
It's already too easy for everyone to vote. Need to fix so only eligible vote.
You say that as if there were thousands of documented cases of illegal voting. There aren't.
Trump argues there are millions. There is zero evidence for this. I have dug into it extensively.
on a serious note please share where one might "dig" for this?
Well the first place you'd start with is the Pew Study that Trump cites a lot
It is here: http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pewupgradingvoterregistrationpdf.pdf …
The guy that never pays taxes wants to waste a pile of taxpayers money because he's insecure about losing by three million.
He's far too trigger happy to be in his position of power.
Will you also be looking into voter suppression? My show @reveal did an hour on it
the cases of documented voter fraud have been so low, there’s no evidence of your figure of 2-3 million illegal voters.
there is a lot of evidence to suggest that voter suppression is happening.
do you have any evidence of the illegal voters?
Let's audit CA voter rolls. CA gives illegals DLs, then automatically registered to vote. Called "Motor Voter"

Looks like Snopes, which we all know is infallible truth, has taken down the link to their alleged debunk of CA Motor Voter fraud
No, there were just extra characters at end of URL. Here you go; this URL should work:
.@realDonaldTrump psssst…if you wanna grab someone who is registered to vote in two states…
How quickly it was forgotten that Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon committed voter fraud himself in Florida @SarahKSilverman @sacca 
his daughter too: https://heatst.com/politics/exclusive-tiffany-trump-is-currently-registered-to-vote-in-two-states/ …
- ok. So Bannon & Tiffany. No wonder he's paranoid.
(So far) Bannon, Mnuchin, Priebus, Kushner, Tiffany Trump are registered to vote in two locations.  @sue_perwoman @Bunny_Godfather
Donald cares whether or not he is liked. He cares about that more than ANYTHING else.

.@realDonaldTrump Kinda like how you promised a "Major Investigation" into Hillary Clinton.  Then you realized you were imagining things!
You know what?  I hope there was 3-5 million illegal votes cast!  Then we get to HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION!!  @realDonaldTrump #NewElection

do you watch VEEP? Show is absolutely brilliant.
yeah, I've seen a couple episodes. Never picked it up because I felt behind on it.
I watched 4 seasons in a few days. Short seasons. 30 min eps. It's easy.
veep is one of the best shows on television and JLD is a god send
Ya. It's legit in my Top5 comedies of all time. It's pure gold.
members of your own staff are registered to vote in two states. I'm regretting my vote
@Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump
Stop wasting time on this ridiculous crap. Focus on the needs of the country, not your ego. Many starting to regret their vote. Focus!
Just 5 days in and you have regrets? Really? You weren't paying attention.
.Seems @realDonaldTrump is gearing up for another big voter purge in preparation for 2018 & 2020 by invoking the myth of #VoterFraud
@Greg_Palast Lock him UP!
We'll see @realDonaldTrump's tax returns before he finds real examples of voter fraud. It's nothing but an excuse to deny our right to vote.
.   Why? You won! Forget about this and stop getting sensitive about everything. This BS isn't why I voted for you. Fix shit
We liberals will try not to say "we told you so" for the next 4 years, but it won't be easy.
The "I told you so's" certainly don't accomplish anything. Sore losers. Didn't c this happen when Obama won
Sore losers? I could DIE without my Medicaid. Im disabled. This is life or death for me

@realDonaldTrump
Yo! @realDonaldTrump , remember when u & ur lawyers said there was NO FRAUD in the last election? No? Here's a reminder.
. @realDonaldTrump I know where you can start this crucial investigation
.@realDonaldTrump Aw hun, investigating voter "fraud" for an election you won cuz you didn't win the popular vote? Insecure much? Sad!
wow but Hilary did the same thing and all you can to is pick out him. Wow your sad!
*You're clearly a very loyal supporter!  Have a nice day!
. @realDonaldTrump alright but go easy on Steve Bannon he just forgot about Florida home where he was registered to vote but didn't live in
.@realDonaldTrump #Gerrymandering is the voter fraud you should focus on. It stacks the deck & dilutes voters' voice
.@realDonaldTrump And if/when we see there’s not massive voter fraud, we can stop the photo ID & other voter suppression actions? #deal?
I'd love to hear why voter ID suppresses voters. If you want to vote, go get the ID. Simple.
you think people barely scraping by, w/multiple jobs can afford a day off & pay for a id?
who said it needs to cost $? Voter ID system can be free. And if you want to vote, use your day off to go get the ID
they don't have days off.  Free id's are nice in theory but someone has to pay for the id's and the people to make them.
statement that is probably extremely rare
I wish that was true.
pretty sure it is true. I've yet to meet anyone who works 7 days a week, and my father owns a business, and he doesn't even
.@realDonaldTrump Not 1 Repub governor says this voter fraud occurred in their states. Ur a pathetic thin-skinned manbaby liar. #trump
Yo @realDonaldTrump if you think there were millions of votes in the election that add up to fraud, call for a re-election.
every state should have voter ID laws. There's no excuse to not prove citizenship at the voting booth.
You prove citizenship at registration, not the booth.
Like Bannon? Or Tiffany?
Donald Trump settled a FRAUD lawsuit for $25M just days ago. So, yes, please tell us everything you know about fraud.
how isn't this a Trump parody account?
you’re a waste of time
don't look far for fraud, your 'advisor' Steve Bannon @briebart is registered to vote in NY and FL.
.@realDonaldTrump great, maybe we'll find out how you managed to "win" an election that you lost by 3 million votes, you turd
Are u serious? Is that an educated guess or something u picked up off the street. Grow up!
a simple google search would have answered that question for you, but here you go http://www.cnn.com/election/results/president …
Like your senior advisor, @realDonaldTrump?  And your daughter?
Wrong. Dear Leader says the fraud is from being *registered* in 2 states. Why do u disagree with the president? Shameful!
ALSO: investigate the #votes stolen in MI, WI, & PA, broken/hacked machines, blocked #recounts, rampant #votersuppression.
Registered to vote in two states: Steve Bannon, Steven Mnuchin, and....wait for it....Tiffany Trump. Also: Putin.
Which one is the baby? (Hint: fat one w/ hair weave that cries when he loses #PopularVote) Answer: @realDonaldTrump https://nyti.ms/2ksvkWN 
DELUSIONAL
let's vote again, only fair way to go about this.. dontcha think! Would be swell and super patriotic tbh.
when Jill Stein investigated voter fraud, she raised money grass roots style. How will you pay for this? Not with MY taxes!
.@realDonaldTrump your senior advisor Steve Bannon is registered in two states.
I see that truthful descriptions of your insane tweets have escalated from "lies" to "bullshit" ;)
Your taking info from buzzfeed? Seriously lmao typical sheep comment. How sad for you.
Typical sheep comment. You support a pathological liar so I guess you have to lie too. How sad for you.
ha! You pretty much copied my tweet. What were you saying about sheep?
It saves time when replying to idiots. Is @realDonaldTrump a liar? Yes/No
If only there were toilet paper for your mind RS
How'd that work for you trump. Just accept that you lost the popular vote by the largest margin yet.
But....didnt you just....?
you're a lying moron and you're wasting our money.
It's the truth. Google it for yourself.
hahahahaha the only evidence I've seen is Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner are registered in two states, genius.
and spicer.
And Tiffany! Boy, it's almost as if being registered in multiple states is totally legal & common!
It is to Democrats.
Congratulations Mr. President, the first arrest for voter fraud has been made.
how about a whole new election, and let the people choose their candidate not the gop or the dnc?
The only Fraud in this election was you RS
Thanks for being the poster-child of Narcissistic Personality Disorder and bringing light to this horrible affliction.
.@realDonaldTrump
I voted for you President Trump but please let go of the Past. You won so let it go, don't let your ego show.
why not look into the ACTUAL crime of voter suppression that occurred rather than your fantasy scenario?
Even you're confused at how you won hence the demand for a recount @realDonaldTrump! 
look in the mirror.
Only voter fraud was Putin/Russia/Comey/Assange. Empty seats at your inaug prove you were installed. You're illegitimate.
Registered in two states? Like your daughter Tiffany and your chief advisor, Steve Bannon?  Two down. 4,999,998 to go.
OMG @realDonaldTrump Some of your own people are registered to vote in two States
that's not illegal. But voting in 2 states is
I know that, And you think they didn't vote in 2 states?  Of course they did @oscarmom355 @realDonaldTrump
I'm unfollowing for a while. Be back in the future
I agree with your perspective
The rest of us will be demanding an investigation of your part in Putin-tampering during the campaign.
.@realDonaldTrump Awesome! Hopefully this will prevent folks like your own Steve Bannon from being registered illegally in two states.
What they do fear, is finding out Hillary lost the popular vote! Thus, their state by state Obstruction. 
we are looking forward to it to. It will once again prove you are the biggest liar and fraud in the 240 year history of US
And out come the left wing nut jobs.Predictable. Half my town in southern AZ is registered in two states nimrods! It's called snowbirds!
You know as well as I do living in Arizona all the snowbirds can get their home state ballots mailed out to them.
Isn't that the truth. We even have a lobbyist from D.C. So anyone that wants to point the finger ought to know facts.
Remember when your lawyers said there was no election fraud @realDonaldTrump? Info:  http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attorneys-said-no-evidence-voter-fraud-2017-1 … #MAGA? #YouAreLying #uspoli
why don't you request a major investigation of voter suppression? Oh right, that got you elected. #InterstateCrosscheck
Voter fraud are you serious When is the people who voted for you going to say Oh Shit what did I do Get Obama back please
@PhdFor Dems can't think in either abstract or logic.
@WayneJ28791698 CAN YOU IMAGINE AN ELECTION WITHOUT WORRYING THAT THE DEMS HAVE STOLEN AGAIN!
I stand by you Mr Trump. I pray this might shut up some of these so called no it all'S. Please make America great again!!!
Technically, I am registered to vote in two states because GASP I MOVED! what a concept! Didn't vote in two states.
You.are.insane.
I believe the number is up to 5 of your staff that are registered in two states! #voterfraud
#voterfraud 
Guess YOU are IGNORING 30 yrs of Democrat Voter Fraud 
on a MASSIVE SCALE...!
...right...?
...else Bob Creamer was lieing.
.@realDonaldTrump Let's just nullify the election results and have a "do-over"! Go ahead. You're POTUS now. Make it so.
starting with the primaries
Build the wall.
his administration is operating through Executive Orders and not with the collaboration of all branches of the government.
Exactly...he's acting like the WH is the Apprentice boardroom...with Bannon as the PuppetMaster...
but Americans will not be silenced. We have to continue to stand up for our neighbors & families.
All the illegals that got drivers licenses voted too. In California, Oregon, Washington and of course NY.
The Democratics have been saying for years "Vote early and vote often.
Comrade @realDonaldTrump Status on VOTER FRAUD? Need help finding @IvankaTrump @StephenBannon @seanspicer @jaredkushner @TiffanyATrump
Comrade @realDonaldTrump Where are these criminals hiding?! How will you find them?!
Killer! Take care of this problem sir!
keep spending our money. You won the election. Move on.
YOU MEAN LIKE YOUR RUSSIAN CRONIES ?

and what are you going to do if the numbers don't fall your way? Will you then step down from office and let Hillary in ?
please start investigation w Steve Bannon, your daughter, & son-in-law.  It seems the fraudulent fruit isn't far from tree.
TICKLER: @realDonaldTrump, you did ask for a reminder on this one, yes? How are we coming along? #mocktrump
I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....
/ Must b why Stein & Hillary backed off their election 'irregularity' probe----found too much Dem fraud!!
So when will you be reversing the elimination of the Election Assistance Commission? @realDonaldTrump
House Administration panel just voted 6-3 to get rid of the Election Assistance Commission, charged w/ helping states improve voting systems
Glad to hear that! Democrats are scared of voter ID. Too many dead voters....
There was an investigation funded by donations in Detroit and in flint and your administration shut it down.
Donnie, while you conduct your unsubstantiated voter fraud investigation, lets have an investigation into VOTER SUPRESSION!
Bannon should be prosecuted for being registered to vote in 2 states,oh wait you only prosecute people that disagree with u
DEM "LANDSLIDE" LYNDON JOHNSON BEAT NIXON 1960 by voting the dead in Chicago & Texas. Every DEM is a Criminal & Vice Versa.
.@realDonaldTrump @ILoveBernie1 Come back when you want to investigate ELECTION Fraud. #BernieWouldHaveWon
GO POTUS!!
so bannon, kushner, spicer, & your daughter tiffany - what's your plan to deal w their illegal votes? (reg in 2 states...)
@realDonaldTrump I asked for an investigation also because that is the right thing to do!
Stealing American's ID's Is a crime & Trump & Pence & Kobach should be in jail 4 that! You will just give them to your Russian friends! #p2
@JackieMcReath1 ...and those who are dead? 
And while you're at it, launch an investigation into Putin and Comey's interference into the election.
Next up: an investigation into unicorns and jackelopes.
#TrumpNotFitForPOTUS #TrumpTreason #trumpregrets #ImpeachTrump
Don't forget the dead people!
check your cabinet. Please seek psychiatric help you're not well
Thank you dear President Trump we support you and all you are doing 
Please change the voting system to make them all public! Get rid of the hackable #votingmachines ,increase #pollingplaces #MakeAmericaGreat!
anybody you think she'll win wasn't legitament is as crooked as Hillary you won fair and square let this go pick ur battles

That's years over due thank you.
Like your daughter and the rest of your cabinet? LOL
Go for it Donald, you have our support.
#VoterFraud #First100Days
The American people deserve integrity in our voting. Thank you Mr. President
Who cares!! Election is over! Get to work please! The people deserve that, thats why they voted you in dude.
investigate welfare/food stanp fraud too.
How about a major investigation into Russian intervention of our election process? The truth will out!
I THINK WE DEFINITELY ALL NEED VOTER ID . AND NO ONE SHOULD BE IN TWO STATES VOTING. VOTER ID CARDS AFTER YOU SHOW YOUR BC.
Trump - you create problems that doesn't exit.
.@realDonaldTrump @WashingtonDCTea Just keep in mind that any "solution" which leads to federalization of state systems is NO good.
you know walls have two sides right? Enjoy caging your electorate.
like your son in law?
will you start with your family and friends?
Didn't you just settle a FRAUD LAWSUIT a few days ago?! You're the FRAUD expert. #NewElection #trumpregrets
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/29/trump-supporter-charged-with-voting-twice-in-iowa/?utm_term=.569cea5f508d … I doubt it. Might find you really lost!
I agree, there is voter fraud from YOUR family & staff(registered in multiple locations) Throw out the results & vote again
DEM Voter Fraud has been constant since 1800 when DEM slaves were counted as voters to vote down free White men as today
You lost the popular vote. Period.
did Bannon tell you black votes are only supposed to count for 3/5's of a vote...is that why you are so confused?
and an investigation into Russian activity is where?  There is a simple solution for voter fraud, PM me - I'll tell you
Thanks for wasting taxpayers' money 
Mr. Trump.
@UnmitigatdTruth good for you it needs to be uncovered and stopped
Like your FAMILY??!!??!!  WHo ARE THE FRAUDS????@realDonaldTrump
Happy to hear this!!!
UPDATE: More than 10 states say they won’t share voter data with #Trump’s voter fraud commission #FuckTrump http://hill.cm/xegKphJ 
Donald duck needs to quit
Registered, 2 states: Stephen Brannon, Sean Spicer, Tiffany Trump & Jared Kushner. Terri Lynn Rote voted 2X for YOU!
registered in two states? Like bannon and your daughter? LOCK THEM UP
Please investigate. Your loss will be even greater.
like your own family?
STOP WASTING MY TAX DOLLARS
UNFORTUNATELY this falls under state control but if you needed birth certificates to get voter ID cards like Fl=less fraud
.@realDonaldTrump Maybe look at voter suppression. Or, how many on your team are registered to vote in 2 states. Sad!
How about Bannon, Mnuchin,  your daughter and son-in-law? All for the other side, right?
the money you spend on that investigation can be spent on Healthcare and schools
start with your own family.
lmao ur sons did that tho
what happened to the investigation???
massive voter fraud in village of Bloomingburg NY in 2014. Smallest Village in NYS
BRAVO! #BuildTheWall #DeportThem!
ok so you are elected president even though you lost but want to investigate voter fraud? Seems fishy 
Your Daughter Tiffany is registered in two states. Start with her you hypocrite.
why. You won.
TRUMP SUPPORT VOTED TWICE AND MORE TO COME. HERE IS YOUR FRAUD YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. LMAO
I invented the term "voter fraud" you owe me $100 each time you use it #CheetoTraitor #ComradeGoldenShowers
like your daughter, and your strategist? #resistance ##notmypresident #RefugeesWelcome #illegitimatetrump
Great idea! I hope you discover that Hillary actually won!
we the people are asking for a major investigation into whether you are clinically insane
Clown!
What about Tiffany. She'd do well in jail. Soon you can be bunkmates.
yes please ask for that
"including those registered to vote in two states"
Some Donald Trump advisers and his daughter Tiffany are registered to vote in two states http://bloom.bg/2jGfkAJ  
Oh, like people in your cabinet, your press secretary and your relatives...got it.
@Trump4prez20166 Go across the nation. Brown allowed illegals to vote.
Shut. Up.
Status update?
Shameful Donny only bringing this up to throw shade on his ties with Russia. Sad times America. #damnthatcrowdwastiny
I know for a fact  illegals use fake IDs. If they can use their stolen identities to buy  homes then they can vote too.
Yes!!!!
Seems as if the Ds(Leftists) are making the 'Last Great Stand'! Either they win, meaning take over America now, or never!
you mean Bannon, kushner and Conway? Start there!
this is absurd! Stop peddling fear - we know your goals here and they are distinctly un-American!
Then you should start with your own team and family members. I believe Bannon was registered in 2 States along with Tiffany, Jared and Spicy
California is the first place you should investigate. #Create Jefferson State!
what about your own daughter dickhead? She's registered to vote in two states. Prob voted twice for ya ass.
that's not a problem tho huh? POS
31 in 1BILLION REAL #voterfraud cases, #LiarinChief Dumbass fact-free #illegitimatePOTUS @realDonaldTrump:
B Creamer Natl DNC - visited WH 350 times, 50 w obama
