Lol a big crowd - that's what matters to you. Most of them there by threat of ostracism. Beyond ironic how much of your world is fake
God Bless you, Mr. President, and your beautiful and brilliant family 
Over 11.000 inmigrantes today became US CITIZEN'S.  Take that POTUS to the bank
*Independence Day
Will they be singing hot tunes like "Make America Great Again" and "All I Do Is Golf" and "I Kissed An Orb And I Liked It"?
What's a big crowd? 100...or in Spice math 1.6 Billion?
Will Scott Baio be there?
Was Toby Keith able to get off his shift at Pep Boys to perform tonight?
Will it only be broadcasted on state run FOX? They love you there you know.
PERFECT RESPONSE!!!!!! HE'S NOT BRAVE, HONEST, OR MAN ENOUGH FOR TRUE BROADCASTING & ANSWERING REAL QUESTIONS!

Meanwhile, the rest of the country...
It is not a day for dictators. Sorry.
Well that's good....since we don't have one

SHE SAID IT WAS OKAY...

Hey
TRUMP
Cool

we miss Hillary
No we don't
Let me guess, biggest crowd ever?
Gay
After a hard day of playing his 36th round of golf as POTUS, at his private golf club, where dues are more than most Americans make in a yr
Trump has spent more than 1 in every 5 days as president at one of his golf courses
so how many millions have we paid for his golf weekends so far
You ain't paid jack!!! Did you "pay" for the last guy during his 8 years and the 200+ golf outings??? ...

more lies.
Happy Independence Day !!!!!
Please Mr President hold fast to your words that got you elected! Don't turn your back on the people of America!
We just found out about Baby Charlie. Thank You President Trump !
How like an oak, strong and sturdy, were the deeds of the men who founded this nation #MAGA #4thjuly2017 @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza
Newsweek says half of your followers on Twitter are fake accounts. What gives?
Fake magazine cover and now fake followers? Not good.
we will probably be blown to pieces 1st ..thanks to your blatant irresponsibility
It will only decay under your leadership..
Thanks for your great service today
AMERICA FIRST!!
THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH!! THANK YOU VETERANS!!
You love the Veterans so much that you prevented the VA from hiring enough staff to help them, #DraftDodger
I didn't even notice.  They do a wonderful job!
Deferments for medical disability usually happen for people who are too injured to play college sports while not in combat.

Be sure to drink in Moderation.....
.@realDonaldTrump WTF!
sundowning, confused, wandering away from his limo, had to be redirected.

Dementia setting in!!
#25thAmendmentNow
Wat did italy france and germany say back to you 
Not written by DJT! Staff wrote this!
Not with you in office!
jealousy will get you nowhere ,curt...call me when you accomplish 10% of what he has...
I golfed once this weekend. That's 25%, so choke on that, Ed.
Ed, not to add fuel to the fire but you just got served
Nothing says the 4th like Prince and flapjacks. 
By the way,  Trump has what's soon to be 3 failed marriages while you're successfully on 1.
Biggest crowd ever in the history of the United States. The best crowd. The smartest crowd. Making crowds great again, no doubt.
Lol, more people were on the streets this weekend demanding IMPEACHMENT. Trump only cares about himself
Wow, who wouldn't want you, such a great disposition, always working for the little hands, oops I meant guys, my bad
And by big crowd do u meen, a couple of your Russian friends and a few hookers

Not while you're in office it wont!
Keep fighting mr president !! Don't give up
Yup, after you leave, certainly not while your President!
There's really not much to celebrate this year, since our freedom is being taken away by our own government! Btw enjoy it while you can!
That crowd is protesting you, but it is big.
It will, but not under your pharisaical leadership.
How big of a crowd is it?  Seriously, how big?  Inauguration Day big?  Or big like your hands?
I must take part to such celebrations.My beloved mum was born in U.S.A.
Not with you as commander in chief. If you really like America then resign so we are no longer the laughing stock of the world
Stay away from England please
Whatchu gonna do about North Korea threatening us man? #Thedonald
Our country will be great once you and all yours are gone.
Every other President has used this time to Honor our Troops, NOT YOU...you golf and lie.
Thank you for your tireless service!  #mypresident
Just like the crowd at your inauguration
How was golf?
Big crowd... of protestors.
Happy late 4th of July Mr President I am so happy that we have some one worth being in there . Thank you for bringing America back .
As soon as you are removed from office yes. Not before and specially not now
our county(Russia)　will grow and prosper!
My wife Tammy is a army veteran and a excellent worker with good work record. She has applied for VA jobs for 9 years with no success.
Happy birthday to the last cute child of a president, Sasha Obama.
Don the con
Thank you for tweeting a nice,
Rational tweet.
MR PRESIDENT PLEASE HELP BABY CHARLIE GARDS LIFE BEFORE THEY PULL THE PLUG.
Yes it will if you resign!
That big crowd was comprised of protesters that want you to resign...
Yea man!!!!
To the repulic really sarcastic!

Are you going to get Spicy to shout that at the press pool like you did after the inaugural my little Trumpkin?
It seems the lower they go the more oilfield unemployment goes up...maybe find the happy medium please
Not so sure the american empire needs to grow anyways, that shit is doing more harm than good in this world.
Jules your nothing but a whining snowflake!

LOVE ur resume potus! 6xs bankruptcy, 3xs babymamas, adulterer, wwe fighter, crap reality tv show, inventor of fake news 4x draft evader!
WHY WASN'T I INVITED?
Happy 4th to you and family.
Stay firm focused faithful and positive.
Ignore the negative stuff.
God bless.
Is it the biggest crowd ever?
América will grow and prosper if you left the WH
Is the crowd as big as your inauguration?
Shouldn't you be off somewhere getting hit in the face by a fast-moving golf ball?

Think again!!!
God...your ego is insatiable. IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU
Pride in America has finally been restored! We are Proud to sing America The Beautiful and NOT be ashamed! Every country should have pride!
Until you resign this country has nothing to celebrate
Did you do a #HeadCount Did you demand2see President Obama's last4thCele pics 2mull over all night?You're so PATHETIC

What, not going to a trump golf course or hotel. Must be odd to spend so much time at the Whitehouse. They may actually expect U 2do UR job!
Fake news...all of it...with tiny hands.
not with you ruining our country one day at a time.
Nothing to celebrate. You, your Russian Admin, and the Repus have destroyed this country. Sickening! Monster In Chief!
I love you so much, President Trump. Please come to visit the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. I sing in the opera chorus there.
Hopefully not grow in the way you want it to.  Polluter!
It will grow and prosper....AS SOON AS YOU'RE GONE!!!
In 2020 under new leadership, this may be a true statement.

Step down before you destroy America
Did millions of people come to the celebrations?
How exactly does it "grow"?  Are you backing #PuertoRico statehood? More likely #Calexit will shrink your regime than any territory joins it
Biggest 4th of July crowd at the White House ever, I'd assume.  #fakepresident
A prosperous country that ignores it's most vulnerable and needy people isn't really prosperous.  Also, shame for making @nikkihaley work
You see, before you even entered the scene, America was ALREADY great - truth
Big Crowd like you had for your inauguration!#TrumpISFakeNews #25thAmendmentNOW #TrumpAdvocatesViolence  #TrumpInsane #TrumpUniversityMotto
Biggest crowds ever!  Very BIGGLY
With you that's a joke
Maybe we all will get lucky and he will a heart attack or he will lose his small fingers
We would like our country to grow & prosper too but that won't happen till TRUMP'S  GONE. WE WANT OBAMA BACK-ONE WITH BRAINS & INTELLIGENCE
Balance the Federal Budget
Happy 4th of July Mr. President!
#45 #MAGA #AmericaFirst #PeoplesPresident
Penis
When you and your corrupt administration is behind bars we will prosper!
How'd you like that Gift from NK??I told you nobody's scared of the USA..stop tweeting,get out the way and let your diplomats do their jobs
Happy 4th to you as well! Thank you!
Nothing will grow and prosper as long as you are in office! You are a fool!
How????  We still do not know your plan please explain it to the American people or at least act like a President!
thanks to our free press -
Big crowd the bigger crowd I have ever seen, is call protesters silly you 
Looks like kim kicked your ass on 4th July Donald. No more bullshit, turn Pyongyang into Glass, so his main export would be glass ashtrays.
Yes - as soon as you resign
Thanks
So you're finally gonna resign then? 
Well they're 60 cents higher than before took office where I'm at. And you don't have shit to do with it
Big big crowd, the biggest ever, way bigger than obamas, about 3 trillion people attended, argue that fake news, I counted on my tiny hands
Obama's had a bigger crowd! Just sayin!! Ha!
#25thAmendment
yes, when you are gone!!!
It's not logical that you celebrate your independence day and don't accept others independence
thank you Mr. President, same to you
Nero fiddled while Rome burned,Trump golfed while NK nuked the US. You turned the other cheek Donnald, Kim slapped that one too, and laughed

WONT DO SHIT AS LONG AS YOUR (FAKE) POTUS!
I bet it wasn't as large a crowd as it was last year, or the seven years prior even.
Same to you Mr trump
Thank you for supporting our troops on this great holiday for our country!
"but only while we can create endless wars in the name of democracy - I'm going to have to look up the meaning of that word someday"

les deceo un muy feliz y bendicido día.
Why do you always have to brag about how big everything is? We know you have a tiny p...air of hands
Grow for sure but prosper not.
So ... big crowd to you mean, what, about 10 people?
Thanks to you, Mr. President. God Bless you !
Here how I celebrate! #25AmendmentNow
Liar you were out playing golf

What crowd?
America has come from Far and is Going Far! God bless Americans. From a Kenyan Friend
fric et pollution !


The only thing growing is u and ur families bank accounts. Robbing Americans with your dirty business tactics
Happy 4th? You gave Russia classified info, don't know Constitution or American history, and dismantling US government.

#Hypocrite #Spy
Happy Fourth Of July
Donnie, America WILL recover from your vitriol presidency. She WILL be great again.
I refused to read your messages yesterday so it was indeed a happy fourth
Hope you n your family had a Happy & safe 4th of July. USA

once you are impeached!
It will "grow and prosper" for the 1%, the rest of us---NOT
