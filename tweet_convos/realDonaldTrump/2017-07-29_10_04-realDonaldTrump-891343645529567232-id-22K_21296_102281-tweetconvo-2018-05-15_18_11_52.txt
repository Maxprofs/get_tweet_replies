#TheResistance #Impeach45 #TrumpRussia #NotmyPresident
Let's see you own it when it crashes!
Do something that makes my life easier. Like give me my money back that I've paid for obamacare penalties!
Omg the need for validation is disgusting. I would suggest you get a dog,  but I like dogs .

3 Years, 5 Months, 21 Days, 23 Hours, 55 Minutes, and 40 Seconds

How’s this tweet holding up for you, Donny-boy?
#TheresATweetForEverything

No one cares about the stock market. Middle class Americans need jobs and fair wages and healthcare!
How is the US dollar doing Donnie?
Obamas doing. Sorry you Blond Clown
Thanks Obama. Your policies won't take effect until 2018 Donnie.
Way to coast off Obama's success, man! Have fun on the golf course this weekend!
Remember when the fear mongering media said the economy would collapse if Trump got elected? More fake news!
US Stock Market up 300% since 2008.  Thank you OBAMA!!
Hey bonehead 
The President is talking about the stock market, not the national debt
Shouldn't that read:
Bonehead - The President
There you go 
Avoiding facts again 
Better get back to your liberal bubble..or safe space
No thanks to u though
American businesses support you Mr President !
THANK YOU!!!!!
So much more getting done and all you get from MSM is "RUSSIANS ARE COMING, RUSSIANS ARE COMING."  Good work sir.
has nothing to do with you.

Thanks Obama!

8 years of sound economic policy will do that. I hope you're gone before you have a chance to fuck it up.
Your fiscal year doesn't start till Oct., Mr. Businessman.   This is ALL President Obama.  Idiot.  #Impeach
U.S. Humiliation up almost 273% since Election!
Nothing compared to how it did with Obama. You will never be his equal or even close.
Thanks Obama! 
No really, thanks Obama! 
I mean it. Thanks Obama! 
Say it with me! Thanks Obama! 
For the people in the back!
Thanks Obama!
Shout it out!
Thanks Obama!

That is good, but the accompanying increase in xenophobia, bigotry, racism, and general vileness is pretty terrible.
Trump needs to reprioritize his morals because they're extremely skewed and warped.
Hard to prioritize something you don't have...
Yeah, and it barely budged when you failed on healthcare, meaning the failure was already expected, and accounted for.
So it's continued a multi year trend, accounted for your ineptitude, and you haven't managed to destabilize it yet.
So basically, you want credit for a boost that follows most elections, topping off years of growth, and isn't really affected by you. 

Odd.
I guess when the first 6 months of ineptitude is topped off with the yuge healthcare failure, you have to go where you can for butt salve.
Buy some more twitter followers. You deserve it!
.@realDonaldTrump & today marks the worst week in 2 years!
Jews are banned from entering 16 Muslim countries, no one utters a word. Trump says to ban Muslims from entering US & the world goes crazy!
By your reasoning we should become a theocratic state run by autocrat.
D.C. Is so corrupt ! They fight POTUS to keep the corruption to steal Americans tax monies
Where we at today Donnie? if you are responsible for it going up you are responsible for it going down so whats the tweet now? Put those tiny hands to work. You too Junior @DonaldJTrumpJr where is the big talk about markets today?
Economy is trending up due to trust in Trump. seeing new construction, banks lending again, businesses hiring again, 'help wanted' signs!
BS  YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW  economic growth develops.
Thank you!

.@realDonaldTrump What's up with the stock market today? Why are you crashing it???
So you're going to own Friday's drop of 665 points and today's crash because consistency, right?
pls help me coin
It’s all DOWN to you Donny Boy.. 

By the way...
“Dow Jones drops nearly 1,200 points in biggest daily points plunge in history”
U.S. Stock Market up almost 20% since Election!...
Just had the biggest single-day stock market drop in 2 years.  

Who are you going to blame this on? President Obama’s?
You can only coast on Obama's legacy for so long.
DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL drops like s stone worst ever in history.
WOW President Turmp. I Guess President Obama's legacy really is over. Now the stock market reflects the true shit he left us with. Love you @MichelleObama @ObamaHitsBack. To Trump: The world investors aren't just white. # I guess you will learn today!
Now that you've ruined Obama's great economic achievements your incompetence is coming to light with the stock market.  Down over 1000pts 2/5/18...largest one day loss ever!  Sad!!!
#dumptrump #lyingtrump #resist @GeorgeTakei

Old news old man.
How about now?
Wrong https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&tbm=fin#scso=uid_8WyYWruJOomdsAeljoagBw_5:0 …
How's the stock market doing today? Trump is a moron. 
#TrumpIsAMoron
 And now it’s DOWn more than it’s gained in the last year. 

Your fault because of Nunes’ stupid memo.

Stocks end sharply lower, extending a weeklong slide, as the Dow Jones industrial average drops more than 600 points. http://apne.ws/Wa9J0gU 
You... uh... I hope you're sitting for this.
U.S. stock market up almost 120% since Obama started his presidency... So what's your point?
You cited a highly opinionated blog website that inaccurately correlates the US market riding with Trump's "success"?
That's like saying the Seahawks are going to be great because the owner is great.
one of my shares went up 30% today. Must be because of you right? Shall we call you @TheGoodGodAbove? Nah...let's not
You mean, you did that?
My 401k has grown tremendously since you took office! Loving this Trump economy 
Please go away. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE just go away.  I don't want to have to look at you or hear from or about you ever again in my life.
We all know you are the best thing to ever hit America. Omg how in the hell did we ever make this far on the earth without you.
Mr President my husband was in his 50's pulled into a meeting at work and out of the blue told the mill was closing!!
Speaking of shark,, what is this secret  trick eric trumps 's got waiting up his sleeve?
Thanks Obama! #RESIGN
Thanks Obama!
Only trump

thanks Obama ... nothing for the fakeass #45 #crazy ass 
@POTUS US Stock Market up almost 20% despite your stolen election.

There. Fixed it for you. 

Everything you touch eventually turns to shit
Do the calculation for 2008-2016. Now that is an accomplishment. Thanks Obama!
Thanks mostly to a GREAT PRESIDENT OBABMA!
Would that include health insurance companies? Asking for a friend.
Thank you President Obama
2- Save Capitalism like Andrew Jackson would
It's been down more than it's been up
Much like your flacid penis
I like this. This is how you make america great again.
You do know it was going up before your taking office yet you take credit sorry state of affairs
Because the markets are ignoring you #lameducktrump
Wow ! Obama did great in getting Stock Market back on its feet !
We know the rich are getting richer that does not help most of us. Just as you promote this it will crash & the #Deplorable will point @You
へい！トランプ！
Thanks Obama...you took good care of us
Every time you bring this up, I will bring up: THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE ECONOMY. IT IS THE CASINO.
Thank Obama
Thanks President Obama!
But not thanks to YOU! #FakePOTUS #SmallBalls #NoBrain
how to block?

Mr President WV needs to hear about jobs infrastructure!! Wages!!!! drug problem!!!!! We are a poor state; WE NEED HELP!
You have been doing an excellent job,  you will continue doing even better & never get distructed  Keep-on moving forward, I need audience!
What is below 40%? That would be the same number as your current approval rating-39%. Go away carpetbagger.
Your approval ratings down way more than that! NOT winning bigly!
Thanks to Obama
Thank you President Obama for the economy!!
Way to go!
Physics! Will it swing equally as far when it crashes?
Right... up or down that it's the question

Thank You President Trump!! And Thank You for getting rid of Scaremucci. Like I said before he is a buffoon
Fake news
even more if you go back to 09 nov.16
Not your doing, so stop the attempted bravado for a system outside of your control... Wait destroying millions of people's healthcare and...
starting drilling on national parks, and allowing banks to issue/buy subprime mortgages ,and toxic asset investments... Come to think of ...
Thanks @POTUS44!
Sign the Russia Sanctions bill! It's the first big win! You ought to celebrate. Need a pen? 
It's called autopilot, dingus.  You haven't actually done anything yet, so it hasn't crashed yet.  Your first budget will wipe all that out.
Hey Donnie, I am a coal miner and want to know where and when my returned job starts.
After a disastrous first 6 months, Republicans lose confidence in @realDonaldTrump
Thank you @realDonaldTrump. We appreciate your efforts everyday.
Thank you President Obama!
You mean your shares up 20% since election
Thanks Obama!
Thank you Barack H Obama. We love and miss u very much
Stop patting yourself on the back. The reason for this positive economy is from the previous administration. Thank you @POTUS44
That is still thanks to Obama, you really don't know how anything works do you? #youareajoke
Who cares?  Rich people getting richer
Eat a 
makes you even richer - but what for? and btw: NOT your achievement, loser.
The rating of how the World Views the United States of America since January has declined almost double that amount
I think we could give you credit for that
The market might be up but my pay check is still the same.Broke as hell after I pay bills to survive,like most other Americans.U fixing that
Everyone has make a $$$ with stock market since Trump become a president, however he doesn't get a credit,,,,
This fact also doesn't help the majority of Americans who can't afford to invest.
& what does that mean? Seriously, what does that translate into real terms for the person on the street? I think you have no idea.
Another Lie?
Awesome! as you are aware & have said yourself in the past, first 6 mo is from from prior admin, send Obama a gift!
Not because of you.
We know stock market doing good. Only non-MSM reports this and fox. As your supporter I must tell you of a possible security threat! to you.
#MAGA @realDonaldTrump
There is a lot more to the economy than the stock market alone.
Bull. Shit
#RussiaGate #TrumpColluded #TrumpTreason #Compromised bogus Peeotus lying scum #UnfitForOffice ridiculed by @HouseGOP DOJ #ImpeachTrump
We still hope you will succeed, but the hope is fading.
The regressive left be like...
#ThanksObama
Tell Obama thanks for that
It's been continuously going up since Obama!  Has nothing to do with you!  How many of your companies went bankrupt?
Thanks Obama!!!!!!!
Not your doing
Making America Great Again!!! God Bless you President Trump! We LOVE you! :)
Residual effects of policies enacted by your predecessor.
russia-trump collusion investigations up infinity percent since Election!
Thanks Obama!!!!!!
So? If you invested millions from daddy in stock index fund, you'd be much richer. Instead, you failed in hot NYC real estate market. Sad!
Ridin' the wave!
The fact that the far left will be angry at reading this news just exposes them for the fake American traitors that they are.
...Sucks though that YOU are still IMPOTENT, eh?
Not because of u
Thanks to the never ceasing Obama effect.
Not because of you!
The sun came up every day since the election too. Must be a causal link there too.
Preparing for the crash
Bubble @realDonaldTrump
How did that help your voters? TheMarket is for Libtards to enjoy. Trumpers hoard food & maybe have savings accounts. Nothing here for them.
This is what real progress is
Actually it's only up 10.49% by the Dow Jones Average.
yes, mr.president,that good news for you,and the states.but if you would take the ball and run with it ,instead of trying to tear down.
Nope #alternativefact
Thank you President Obama! #BarackObama
Delay of economics? Thanks, @POTUS44 I guess?
Your #ApprovalRating down to record lows since the election, too. Coincidence? I think not.
And the way you and your congress are doing, we headed for a downfall.  FYSB
Your math is really bad. I think it's more like you're really stupid
Of course it's because of POTUS as is our improving climate and Air quality and stable members of his administration.
Been going up for years. Seems it drops when you speak
