Trump has not put US safety & security of for sell to the highest bidder. End of debate.
Trump is No one's puppet.
Move on Thomas the troll - No one believe Hillary's lies - Trump is a Patriot - Hillary is a Traitor.
Find one KKK member who is voting democrat and I'll give you $20. YOUR DAD WAS IN THE KKK!
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
The man was killed for being a spy to the US and his name was on Hillary exposed email data.
And the KKK currently endorses you for President. Well, isn't that special?
Donny, SHUT UP!

Yeah, FORMER. As in, disavowed when she was a small child & turned around.
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
@DrMartyFox @realDonaldTrump @foxnation OUTSTANDING!
Keep working on the emails and Clinton foundation. She is losing her mind!
The actual debates are going to be epic!!
And for anyone who tries to justify Byrd here is a quote
Never let anyone forget this relationship!  Crooked Hillary and not only guilty by association.......Mentor? Good grief!
you were endorsed by David Duke.
That's because in Real Life she IS a Racist! She just lies about it for Votes like libtards all do! #MAGA #Trump

@HillaryClinton

Sen. Robert Byrd endorses Obama http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0508/Sen_Robert_Byrd_endorses_Obama.html …
How quickly she forgets!
Byrd, unlike David Duke, disavowed the Klan many decades ago.
Donald Trump spent $55,000 in camapign donations buying copies of his own book  http://on.nowth.is/1e9a 
and praised Margaret Sanger(founder of Planned Parenthood wanting to 'abort babies of color') social engineering
let's not forget Margret Sanger who advocated for the extermination of African Americans, Hillary's roll model
.@realdonaldtrump FLASHBACK: Largest charitable donation Trump ever made was $100K to Clinton Foundation @foxnation
His foundation did give $100K to Citizens United Foundation in 2014 @RiskyLiberal @realDonaldTrump @foxnation #DefeatGOP
Hmm..you are a complete racist!http://www.thewrap.com/former-kkk-grand-wizard-tells-us-how-donald-trump-dog-whistles-to-closet-racists/ …
THERE YOU GO THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT FANTASTIC
Must-see TV: @HillaryClinton on @Morning_Joe tomorrow. Enjoy!
@MarkCzerniec @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @Morning_Joe
her dementia caused her to forget about that little old thing with Byrd. #HillarysHealth
how's that David Duke endorsement working out for you?
@Thepharoh21 @realDonaldTrump @foxnation ya'll crack me up considering Robert Byrd mentored her and she idolized Margaret Sanger!
"Trump Says Judge’s Mexican Heritage Presents ‘Absolute Conflict’. Racist!
Under our laws, anyone can ask for a different judge if they feel there may be a bias against them
Paul Ryan a republican said it was the text book definition of racism!? I guess both have said something racist
Democrats lie to POC to get elected and then don't do a damn thing. Sick of it.
no she didn't, that was you.
Flashback: you called @DrDavidDuke a good man
I'm rubber you're glue
Byrd apologized, repeatedly and said one of his biggest life regrets was his racism.  You're still a racist.
Do you research AT ALL when you smear? Apparently not... Weak sauce, you are panicking!
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
From my recollection, after that KKK thing, Sen Bird "saw the light" before he passed?
Sen Byrd, rather.
And neither of you could earn an honest day of pay, like a real man.
flashback: trump admits he's democrat trump bankrupts  several businesses trump sued for ripping off Americans
She also called Margaret Sanger "A GREAT WOMAN", she created Planned Parenthood, to rid us of undesirable races
Donald J Trump = RACIST
You were given the opportunity to show if youd be tough on terrorists

White supremacists celebrated when you blamed counter protesters!
Hillary is a racist! Guilty people accuse other people first. Shame on you.
.@lisaymatthys @realDonaldTrump @foxnation -says Lisa WHO RT'S & STARS KNOWN WHITE SUPREMACISTS??
15 years ago 3000 Americans burned alive by islamic terrorists, now pro-Islamic terrorism stooge Hillary can run for POTUS?
stick to this message
William Fulbright also. mentor to B and H
.@realDonaldTrump @foxnation Lets just ignore that Byrd repudiated and sought forgiveness. Me? I embrace my bigots!
Trump literally never said any of this.
Do you know what Bigot means? Stop using it, you're making yourself look like a clown show! 
is that right.. 62% of republicans want trumps tax returns
Typical conservatives
Nothing like citing actions from 60 years ago to deflect from your own bigotry! @realDonaldTrump @foxnation
Oh your just mad is working. Hillary has a history of racist comments &Behavior towards blacks
if only you could see what Trump has said about black people
Trump fighting racism 30 years ago 
http://linkis.com/worldpoliticus.com/36gtC …
So, uh, why did he stop black people from renting in his buildings? @6bird4 @chatty216 @realDonaldTrump @foxnation
it's a little long but a solid look at the many false the narratives spun by left
You're as unintelligent as your son. The NAACP memorialized him he's changed so much.
Thank God people can change.  At least some - Trump never will.
Right. He won't. He likes being a racist.
An attention-getter for sure! Creepy, creepier, creepiest.
Trump likes being center of attention which his weird yellow hair and his orange oompa-Loompa skin
's history of racism, from 1970s to 2016; http://goo.gl/ANf3Qa  ...though supporters think it a good thing.
Doubtlessly true @AusAesthetics. The denigration of others is unnecessary for expressing Love however, as well as foolish.
Bill wanted to give make Lee's birthday a holiday same day as MLK

BIRD...
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
@WayneDupreeShow @DiamondandSilk @SheriffClarke @latinos4Trump Trump is the Uniter for 2016. #TrumpTrain
You would do well to be more like Senator Byrd. But we all know that will never happen.
Mr Trump this name calling is a distraction, please focus on Hillary's policies and corruption.... and you win!
Here are some ideas for an AD blasting Hillary
dumpthetrump, Bird was in the klux klux clan, prob. with your father, differance is he got out a better person.
put an add out on this
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
ya know who isnt praising KKK members? Nia Aqua! Makin chill
 retro 80s tunes for ur rascist ears Check me out!
He left the KKK and spent the next 40 years if his life apologizing for his being a racist.
@HillaryClinton  Hillary gives HYPOCRITE and LIAR new meaning. 
Trump is NO RACIST. Speaking as a black female!
#shutUpStupid
we all know. Dems always backed the Klan. Y not? They created them.
More desperate trump lies to try and save his sinking campaign
Here's a little more you can attack Hillary on
Hillary has a huge nazi following on her Twitter account. Another solid point. Man, please skip debates.
YES SHE DID GOT  MONEY  FROM THE   KKK
http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/07/14/funny-die-releases-video-donald-trump-rapping-nazis-kkk/ …
You're entire schitick is racism. You and your alt right ilk should be banned and deported.
Trumps biggest feature is definitely his Mouth, but what is it about the Yellow Hair?
and you know what he said about once being a member?
well she's not the one with one percent of the African American voters, is she, Mr. Trump?
Sen. Byrd apologized and expressed regret for his earlier views. Your current campaign manager is a bigot.
sure… #whineylittlebitch

@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
Why is Clinton trying to supress freedom of the press with her remarks abt.Brietbart ...She went too far??
Let's not forget, she's currently being supported by another hate group, the BLM.
thats like being critical of followin St. Paul who used to kill Christians. Wait, you don't even read the bible.
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
you r making a complete fool of yourself.
do you only quote FauxNews Donnie Boy?
Left wing radical Alinskyite Clinton calling you radical?  Seriously???
correction the name is Hillary KKKlinton
4.  Look it up and educate yourself.
Where is the OUTRAGE and Disavowing Bias LIBERAL MEDIA?
@MirageRanch @foxnation And Robert Byrd said the N word until the day he died
Byrd disavowed and changed and became an example of what knowledge and faith can do to a heart.
Trump's father was a KKK member.
Man your pulling at straws hoping that something will stick. Good luck finding a project to work on. H4 2016
please do not call crooked Hillary Bagget. Let her call your name. Please stay focus on her and also Obama. Win an win.
2 words...........AndrewBreibart
fact check agrees, Americans black-and-white should fact check the Clinton role in Africa.
the Dems: party of slavery, founders of KKK, keeping the blacks/ minorities down by way of welfare and poverty!
you do know he apologized and recanted and worked the rest of his life to atone? No, you know nothing of principle
they forgot that fact bc they were busy getting rid of Roger Ailes...
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
He Loose
U have become a fool puppet to your new staff. Laughable how they r punking U. Pull your strings and you speak
was it before or after this fall she had https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154469286558875&id=131942223874&ref=m_notif&notif_t=tagged_with_story …
You don't know or don't care about the history in this country. Byrd became a fighter for civil rights. Clown
Not that it matters, not sure trumpladites can read, but there's this:
Flashback you are a racist be sure to check the right box vote Democrats you will flip flop everyday no good
Well, this will only play with the base you already have, because they're obviously mentally challenged.
LIKE I SAID, U LOVE HILLARY CLINTON, U KEEP TALKING ABOUT HER
@RuthStJames18 @foxnation I'd lay off flashbacks if I were you.
Byrd apologized for his mistakes he was a far better man than you will ever be he admitted when he wrong!!!
you really want to get into YOUR flashbacks?
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
... Hey You Liberal Leftests, you're all  Matzoh scramble hypocrites
Sheets Byrd!!
After he renounced the KKK.
You forget he apologized and did more than you will ever do to atone for his misdeeds.  #NeverTrump Bigot.
You mean the guy that disavowed the KKK in the 1950s, and went on to be exalted by the NAACP?
why R you ignorant of history? Why are you so epically stupid? http://thegrio.com/2010/06/28/the-evolution-of-robert-byrds-racial-politics/ …
too little too late Donnie. Call it a night and count your loses in the morning. #NeverTrump
Democrats had a few KKK members in their party. I don't know why they act like it never happen. LOL
Yep, she sure did!
Robert Byrd, who left the KKK, denounced it, expressed total regret over it telling others never to join it?
and then NAACP praised him and mourned him after his death for changing and helping PoC
Pure Evil...dark as the Devil himself! I'm a good judge of lcharacter. do you EVER see her have Grandma time?
someone told you this, huh?     You know nothing.  You live in a tower 
Go home dump trump
There are ppl alive right now that lynched African Americans and spit on them at lunch counters. They support you! @realDonaldTrump
I too would praise anyone who saw the error of their ways as a youth and worked tirelessly against the KKK
- Get List of All Who Gave to Clinton Foundation, call them out and seek Favors they received! Pay For Play!
Mr Trump please stay out of this. You need 2 drive your message. Don't b pulled into tweeting stuff it's NOT IMPORTANT.
Except Hillary telling her supporters Trump embraces KKK & is racist; Trump's silence implies agreement.
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
who want a four year old boy in the white house
HOW INCONVENIENT FOR HILLARY.
Some people can evolve and become better people. Sen Byrd is one of those. Why don't you give it a try?
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
And TODAY your campaign CEO is a white supremacist! You are such a f'g fraud! #NeverTrump #scampaign
do you have any knowledge of history? read a book. or simpler for you, watch a youtube video...it's pictures not words.
https://twitter.com/Jollarn/status/767791240188395521 …
Bird was a major leader in the KKK, during the time when lynchings were commonly being done, by the KKK.
"Former" KKK member. Who apologized. While you embrace present KKK member David Duke. #bigot
Donnie gets full support from David Duke and Klan members...TODAY!!!!! White racist fully support Trump!!!
Check snopes...

@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
did you also praise a kkk member?
Please educated yourself!           http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-mourns-the-passing-of-u.s.-senator-robert-byrd/ …
NAACP whose convention you wouldn't speak at, praised Byrd http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-mourns-the-passing-of-u.s.-senator-robert-byrd/ …
clever how you guys leave out the part where Byrd left the KKK and became a defender of civil rights
@GroAPairAmerica @foxnation Hence the word Bigot comes to mind
because he was a great Congressman who championed civil rights and was honored by the NAACP for those efforts 
Doood, U stood on an escalator, announced run for POTUS & then called Mexican's rapists & murderers
Get back on track - jobs, national security, national debt to win new supporters. We know Hillary's a hypocrite.
you acknowledged the head of KKK several times then said 'David who?' You're a hypocrite. You will never become POTUS
glass houses... Glass houses
and don't forget about their donations to her campaign this year
Did someone get under you thin skin today Donny? You really need to put the phone down.
.@realDonaldTrump Unlike your KKK embracing self, Byrd disavowed his racism. His passing was mourned by the NAACP.
@VistaJake @foxnation Newsflash: Not
Delete your account.  @realDonaldTrump
use that in an add. Very effective.
Remember the "joke" she made about Gandhi working in a gas station in St. Louis? @BWV_54 @foxnation
Yes.
and you just hired a wife beater as campaign CEO
: Former Grand Wizard of #KKK? What a hell you got to loose, get on #TrumpTrain #Election2016 #USA
3.  don't know what you're talking about.  Why do you think he was so respected in the Senate?
@realDonaldTrump @foxnation
Saw today a claim they have given her $20,000 for campaign.
