Isolationism is so very wrong for our country and so very wrong for the world. And please please please address Puerto Rico.
He doesnt BELIEVE a word that he is reading
When are you going to stop getting on national TV and lie to the American people. Nothing "great" about that!
Puerto Rico is a higher priority, don’t you think?!? They are US CITIZENS, after all.
Stop embarrassing yourself.
Workers? Like the ones you didn't pay?
Don...all I know is u better get that God Damn Health care done.  I give a shit what u gotta do, how nice u gotta be...

#TrumpTurdTweets
At least someone gives a shit enough to try!!!
10pm on east coast. Get into your pull up and get mommy to put you to bed  at least for 8 hrs you can do no harm. Sleep old man
Meanwhile, Puerto Rico is literally begging for help. What a nasty president
Stay on the MAGA agenda & ignore the haters. Those of us that voted for you, LOVE you & believe in you! We know the swamp is deep!
Bark bark bark. 
So many words, so little meaning!
You do know they'll obstruct 
Hey Donny, get rid of the #jonesact & do the right thing-take care of Puerto Rican's. Aka American Citizens.  Tax reform? NFL? Priorities?
Amen!! #MAGA
Mr. President - you should be ashamed of yourself. Not lifting the Jones Act for Puerto Rico after you did the same for Texas and Florida??
Yes. Overdue.
Wow! Look at all of those beautiful (made in China) red hats.
Puerto Rico
It is time to fight for freedom!
You can start by keeping your promise to release your tax returns.
This is joke right?

LOCK HER UP
YOU still manufacture YOUR products overseas because YOU don't care about giving Americans jobs at a decent wage. Nothing applies to you?
THE CUBS JUST CLINCHED THE NL CENTRAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#GoCubsGo
I’m running against Maxine Waters
Wat is t toch n geweldige president hè @erikmouthaanRTL @WouterZwart @chgroenhuijsen 
Komt gewoon na wat ie beloofd heeft
Cc @frenkie4allll
Schitterend. Welke nagekomen belofte bedoel je trouwens? De belastinghervorming moet nog uitgewerkt en gekeurd worden.
Wat heb je eigenlijk tegen Trump? Dat ie een rechtse agenda heeft? Zit dat linkse karakter zo ingebakken bij de journo's v tegenwoordig?
Bugs Bunny vs Hillary Clinton
#LittleRocketMan
Donald Trump has an amazing arm #DumpNFL #TakeAKnee
This tweet violates Twitter's conditions. You have been reported!
He's gonna go tell his mommy in you!!
You’re so full of sh*t, you tell one lie after the other!  I’m sure that you lie so much you don’t know what the truth is!!!
By "our people" he means billionaires.
Amen!
Need to keep medical deduction for 2017.  Need to give us heads up so we can plan.
Translation: More corporate welfare
Mr. President; can you please help Kris Saucier? I love what you're doing for this country sir! Helping Kris and his family would be great!
God Bless you sir. Thank you for your support. #pardonkrissaucier #twosetsofrules
good job!!... mr. president,.. thank you!!
#MAGA

You are correct Mr PRESIDENT and I am with you
A PROUD AMERICAN
Taking care of "our" people would include Puerto Rico. You weren't real responsive to help them so this tweet is moot.
Then start with those Puerto Rico and states devestated by #ClimateChange induced storms. 
Allot $$ for infrastructure, not useless wall.
Oh, the same way you are fighting for our people I Puerto Rico? #SavePuertoRicoNow
What about the people of Puerto Rico?  They're dying!  You will be held responsible if you don't do more.  Puerto Rico will be your undoing.
Psst.. you have Trump goods made in China.
And have twitter fights with everyone. #LiarInChieff #PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoStrong #TaxMiddleClass
You`re right but I thing you need to thing in all peope in over world too.
Take care of Puerto Rico FIRST! They ARE Americans!
You mean your people - your crooked buddies & family & yourself. You took your time to care about the people of Puerto RICO - US citizens.
Please  stop taxing our Social Security.  The original promise was this was not going to be taxed.
If you want to help. Resign now!!
Take care of millionaires. Tax plan like everything else in this administration is a joke
So why are the 'snowflakes' so anti Trump?  Brainwashing perhaps?
Then stick to your tax plan the hell with 4 brackets and the hell with 20 percent corporate tax. 15 and cut taxes across the board! Cut gov!
Error: How sick is that? WE WANT OBAMA BACK. He would care and help. Not just complain that PR wants a hand out.
@realDonaldTrump  OUR people is all people. No matter race or their past. Because our nation was built by immigrants  
Puerto Ricans r Americans-u talk about their debt and are increasing our debt w/big breaks for the rich, not much for middle/lower class.
One tax rate for all. 15% corp tax rate is what you said campaigning. Don't backdown. Why is being RICH a bad thing???
Except for the people that work at your resorts you don't hire Americans for that what do you have to say for that?
#fake news
You dont know how. you ust say waht the russians tell you to.
It’s all words no substance and no delivery
Rethink NFL in very near future tax reforms.LBJ era created the biggest welfare and entitlement system this world has ever seen NFL included
'Our' people. You mean the 1%ers like you and your charter jet flying cabinet. Because that's who'll benefit from your plan, not the workers
I totally agree, and you need to keep doing what is best for the country. This is a great course of action!
So far your all talk no action.
Puerto Rico is OUR people.  Didn't see you fighting for them.  Only increasing their problems. Especially with that bankruptcy of yours.

This is might be the worst thing the piece of shit @realDonaldTrump has said or done and that's saying a lot.  https://twitter.com/LaChristie/status/913605637573169153/video/1 …
First step get rid of u and your cabinet stealing millions daily
All your taking care of are the top 1% everybody else gets screwed you fraud #dumpallrepublicans#dumpdotard
Thank you so much for all you do and have had to put up with.
....and reduce our debt! No more debt ceiling increases!
Guess what ? Puerto Rican's R OUR people they R AMERICANS shame on u for comments re mayor of San Juan's poor leadership LOOK IN THE MIRROR

Exactly right Mr President! MAGA!!!
Be strong!
BLOW that dog whistle Trump!
Amazing
Past Time!  Honored you won & lead with winning agenda! 
You are well known for stifling our great American workers. #ImpeachTrump
I'd point out he's lying, but that seems a little redundant at this point.
It's actually past time!

Golden showers trickle down. Just because you enjoy them doesn't mean the average people like getting pissed on.
Said a man who golfs instead of working.
Keep your head up presedent Trump history will look back with pride on you
Such a jerk
Mr. @POTUS, why don't just have STRAIGHT % tax across the board 4 except CORP. say 15% tax income 4 everyone. So those work more get more.
This is just another professional produced propaganda video to glorify Trump!
Ain't buying it. He is a world class con-man! Impeach!
#ArentYouInJailYet? #MuellerIsComing
Fix the tax code-don't remove state deductions for CA NY etc-will hurt too many already struggling
Then have your and Ivanka's products produce here instead of 17 other countries!
Totally agree. When do you resign?
So we have a President with an opinion on everything down to the NFL but last summer he couldn't say 3 words we all know, "Nazis are bad"?
Amen..There is a GOD.. AKA Donald..
Trump Prayer, Now I lay Muslims down to sleep. I pray the Lord gay souls to keep if they die before I wake let's go out and eat Trump steaks
LIAR!
Is that why you and your daughter-wife ivanka import all of your clothes & hats from China? #liar #dirtydon
Thank you President Trump. America loves and support you.
What if President Reagan tweeted! He would be just as cool!
43% reduction for top 2% and 17% increase,lower and middle class, guess that's helping all Americans isn't that you tweeted all Americans lo
President Trump,
The Lord has just impressed upon me to direct you to read the book of Haggai verse 1:1-2:23 in the Bible
A million dollars on private and military jets?!?!?


Trump hands 80 percent of proposed tax cut to top 1 percent http://ow.ly/X2fk30fxMmw 
Fake NEWS
All i can say is lol.
You don’t have the right the to say OUR NATION, only native Americans do!  Your ancestors came to this county as immigrants!!

What's taking you so long then???
@RealDonaldTrump I DARE you to Retweet This :)

Let's #MAGA and LAUGH!! You Know It's About Time We Laughed at Them!
Oops Upside Your HeadSo, @HillaryClinton is that #WhatHappened ?! Watch that Step! U Might break a cellphone *Cough*
http://crwd.fr/2yMyrRq 
You got that right...you sure got that right.
You're right! So step down so we can do that!
Puerto Ricans are Americans! And you speak of us as if we are nothing.
Then get your ass to PR. Or did you not know they are part of US
No one with education or intelligence believes you. Only your hillbilly base.
#Thankyou @POTUS #TaxCuts #TaxReform we are #TaxedEnoughAlready 
TRUMP uses the govt to get more money for his rich family, himself and his rich friends. The rest of us are screwed.
Only if you are rich!!
Then what are you waiting for Donald! It's your job! Get to work or YOU'RE FIRED!!!
It's time the people took care of themselves #bollox #Lawfullrebellion
the aids around you are keeping from telling you that Assange has proof Russia Narrative is false in exchange for pardon. Why??
We need to figure out how to have a regular America person run for congress & the senate. Not a lawyer or political person in it 4 themself
Your tax bill does not take care of American workers. It appears that you & your elite buddies will be well taken care of. Shame!
If adding $10 Trillion to the economy and $3 Trillion to government revenue simultaneously isn't Making America Great Again, what is? #MAGA
President Trump's tax plan is nothing short of brilliant! Reagan would be very proud
The fact that trump both don and ivanka make their products were it is cheaper cheating?

#MAGA believe it when rich people tell them they need tax cuts to make poor people's lives better.   #TaxReform #Fraud
Too bad your bill only helps the 1%; and does nothing for the working class. You wave your $1000 credit around like a carrot on a stick.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/new …  get these bastards off the street & doing some real jail time
God bless. The Don
We love you President Trump! I'm a woman an I like my voice! I'm disappointed Michelle Obama thinks she speaks for me! I speak for myself!
Shut up
After 8 years of Obama's divisiveness and world tour apology on behalf of America, it is such a blessing to have a man @POTUS love America!
@POTUS #RebuildingAmerica 1) stop giving #taxcuts to the 1% 2) Stop #outsourcing jobs from your businesses...
3) Being a leader is more than paying lip service, you have to actually do it. #MoreTrumpHypocrisy #MoreTrumpLies
