please make these. I want 100, to start.. So I can put them over every fucking Trump sign I see. Thanks. 
Theres a giant sign in my neighborhood. I don't recommend children trick or treat there
I cringe every time I see one. I think there should be a surge of vanishing Trump signs.

Guess if Obama had made the economy better, you thugs would have jobs instead of
police records. #vandals #losers #thugs
Haha!!! Racist because I think you're thugs? (You're breaking the law.) Or

@rtbeliever @realDonaldTrump   Wow!
Your income would have to be 250k to get this bill. Trumpers always leave the facts behind
so what? Still should not have to be fined!
We all get fined when uninsured people dont pay their medical bills. Y not make them pay?
It's a republican idea to make people actually pay for the shit they use inc. healthcare.
My husband and I pay close to 25k yr for Ins... just the two of us.
Sounds right. It sucks. It's the overuse driving up prices. Single payer best fix Ive seen
Wait, confused..."she wants to make #obamacare even worse and it can't get any worse" Say what?!
She threatened to tell everyone that @elizabethforma was her lover. #takeittothebank
It will be worse with Trump! Her really don't have a plan
I have been to his site. Go to her site. I already voted

Take time to read the paragraph above the one you circled, then re-post.  This is your homework assignment.
Interesting that the new, super-expensive but still junky BRONZE plan POS 5500 actually has POS in the policy designation
Paper even says: This isn't a Marketplace Plan.
You must go to the Marketplace and enroll in another plan.
Illiterate much? It's right there
i have 3 insurances.  Hardly get coverage. Drs say bills dont get paid. Tricare military, medi-cal & medicare. Upsetting
I have just Tricare. No problem with my doctors getting paid provided they are in network.
I have Tricare too
I make 24k a year... This is my cheapist plan. Why should I bother with insurance that has a 7,000$ deductible ??
If you really make $24k, you qualify for Medicaid. Unless your Republican governor refused to expand it.

said nobody ever... Well besides cnn 
@LittleLobbyists - yes let's look 
@lgmaterna Crazy..thanks to Democrats..this is our America.  
OLD NEWS: Read the letter. It is telling the person to go find another plan in the marketplace to get lower rates. WhyULie?
Huge! Will you please raise the minimum wage? How can I afford health care? Sad
This is so crazy! How can anyone afford health insurance? #ObamaCare has become a joke. $711 to $1872 month. BS.

#MAGA
Read it again. NOT A MARKETPLACE PLAN. Private insurers, private corporations, raise prices, end affordable plans for PROFIT.
People don't read and knows that .
Like the dems who said you need to "pass it to find out what's in it." Or "Like your Dr or healthcare plan, you keep it." Or"$2500. Savings"
As a conservative who believes in the "free market" you should know the difference between a company doing something for profit v gov't reg.
but it's not doing anything to your employees, or didja not know that?
#orangeisthenewgreen
,,,ANOTHER OBAMA...
,,FUCKUP.....
Thank you for taking on this task only you had the courage and the  $ To reveal the corruption proud of u .TRUMP 2026
#Twitter is removing tweets  RT RT RT #ObamacareFail #Obamacare #VoteTrumpPence16 #TrumpTrain #AllAboard #FullSteamAhead
Only 3% of ACA insureds effected by this!!!
pay with us taxes. We're in a huge deficit anyway. It's just paper money
Looks like its Costa Rica for healthcare then
Single payer.
And as you point out DEDUCTIBLE costs are even more insane! How can anyone afford a $4,000 - $8,000 dollar deductible? #ACA
We need a hard look at what hospitals are charging the insurers. Some1 I know paid $450 for a pair of crutches
ER DOCTORS ARE BEING Ask TO IMPLEMENT immediate HOSPICE IN ER ROOMS #Obamacare ?
We need to get back to the core of INNATE FAIRNESS and everyone putting in their fair share of effort.
TN premiums went up by 62! TN passed a DPC (no insurance) law that drops costs by 20%+. Please look at it!

#Obamacare
NOT A POLICY IN OBAMACARE EVEN LIKE THIS... prove it; tell me the zip code and policy numbers....
@BHogg93 everyone should tweet their increased premium!!!!
HR 2300!
@LisaLoni14 replace with.....? By now there should be a branded replacement.
free market, fee for service, Obama has destroyed University Charitable Hospitals ! How'd we get em back?
that example is not a marketplace plan.
mine also went from $850/MONTH before Obamacare to $1840/MONTH with $5000 ded.
@Bill_Donlon Obamacare premiums have been mailed out already people are in Shock and changing their votes. Must love timing
try using "we" instead of "I" will fix it. We Republicans will fix it. Save the nation! Vote Republican
Bullshit!  If vote out #Republicans and their unprecedented obstruction of the #ACA  it will be improved.  #VoteBlue
umm...that clearly isn't part of the aca marketplace.
OBAMA,HATES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
at least those who voted for Obama are getting what they voted for...
this is a complete skewed tweet. 85% of those with obamacare gets govmt subsidies and will continue to pay < than $100
Tired of this crap. Fed too big so do no infrastructure rebuilding and force those getting handouts to work for it? STUPID!
Ask oneself, Why would any #PublicServant work so hard to keep less fortunate and women/children from having insurance? #RT
Look its a pvt ins issue Not Obamacare issue. Obscene Profits over ppl. Single payer or all will NEVER have.
.. the obama affordable care is awful.. no help for people.. u might as well not have any at all..
But @HillaryClinton will fix healthcare with her "experience"!
I get not liking Trump. But be real here. #Obamacare is a fucking disaster. Needs to be repealed.
@BarackObama Congratulations! #Obamacare = absolute disaster. My premiums are going up 12% and my out of pockets doubling. @realDonaldTrump
gop dont want healthy,happy,educated,smiling republicans, that would make them democrats,silly @realDonaldTrump
Swampdonkey
Thanks #Obamacare you knowlingly screwed the middleclass again. Independents 4 @realDonaldTrump #TrumpPence16
The Middle Class cannot afford these premiums folks. This is the lefts work on eliminating the Middle Class.
@rfitzger71 You have no replacement and people are fearful of that!!!

the plan you're showing isn't an Obamacare plan.
@DiamondandSilk That's insane might as well say to hell with coverage.
The Dems bleed Americans so they can treat travel entourages & buy mansions in Hawaii.  WE PAY & THEY PLAY GOLF
1872/month are you fkn insane !
Politicians are maggots, repent !
@NobamaDotCom wow that premium is crazy how is anyone supposed to afford that
Hey @GretchenInOK, look who used your example !
Men DO listen sometimes! 
I am a man and you rock, Gretchen for president !  :-D
Good morning to YOU, too! 
Never underestimate the power(s) (yours) you have as a citizen.
Inet is a discussion platform.
@LindaSuhler They is my African American. Trump is in the mold of. George Wallace, Lester Maddox and their ilk.
@LindaSuhler ACA Children can stay on their parents care until they reach 26. We are not stupid it's about a black POTUS.
@LindaSuhler Are we to go back to worthless polices written by Companies in Alabama for the other states? No way Linda.
@LindaSuhler Pre ACA: Lifetime Caps, Sky High Co Pays,No prescription Coverage. No pre existing conditions. Fake coverage.
-- I could not take it at the debate with Hillary saying she wants to keep it!  And people buy this junk?
Who can afford those kinds of premiums? #ObamaCare is a disaster. It must be replaced with a better plan.
@DiamondandSilk It's killing us! Not enough $ to fix the home, crammed in. Raising utilities by 50%. Middle Class? Hahaha
@DiamondandSilk ya and people can't afford obamacare fines
@lyz_estrada 

If elected, hope u pass Medicare 4 all.  It gives 100% cov w/no copay, no deductibles at 1/2 cost of ACA
can you show the rest of the letter?
and if you don't pay that they will send you this bill
Obama knew this would happen. Obamacare was intended to make us poor
@DavidDbgadjet as a disabled/Pgh pa-denied refused HC? I ask,BC I am only a citizen,voting Trump,ERIN 4127822151
#Imwithyou Erin Donald is right  We must repeal & replace #Obamacare

@DiamondandSilk My son's plan !!  (Sorry it's sideways). 68% hike !!
crooks
@DiamondandSilk Jeff Rovin was just on Hannity Say a prayer he doesn't die suspiciously #sad  #1nationunderGod #corruption
so how does hillary arrange these hits?
let me just say I never want to be on her sh_t list
hard to believe she talks like that
@DiamondandSilk  1 person on BCBS Not used this year 2017 bill received today
QUADRUPLE increase
#2017Obamacareincrease
I am voting for you on this issue alone. Ocare is a disaster. My coverage sucks and premiums are unaffordable.
@DiamondandSilk Its part of the plan, Obama's transformation of America...remember his speech? #TrumpPence16 must win!
@La_Cooks this is bad in TN, the whole program is collapsing as people cannot afford the coverage.  Trump's plan is better
as a self employed person I got this letter 2 years ago.  It's been painful.
just had to renew my insurance.. once again, higher premium and higher copays and less coverage.  Horrible and real life.
@DiamondandSilk yes! Our premium just went from $600 to $824 for two people!
@amystanley4242 

And if not paid they get fined ?????
Guess that math is not Obama's strong suit, holding Soros' COAT is.
@DiamondandSilk you might want to have a plan to talk about now
@DiamondandSilk Misleading on purpose again! If they reenroll in "Obamacare" they'll get a lower premium & subsidies!
Hammer this point! There is no defense by the Dems!!
@irwin47shari 
Going up 25% Nov. 1, 2016 wake up people Obamacare sucks
stay on point with repealing #Obamacare  Americans will lose their mind when they see how much less they will have monthly
agree, focus on TAKE HOME PAY for people -- 1) lower taxes, help ppl under $$ to them and 2) obamacare = win
@DiamondandSilk An inside the beltway crooked politician can't fix this. Make no mistake, she also doesn't give a shit!
@DiamondandSilk Obama failed math! This is not 25%!
#Obamacare #Ducksontheground
@DiamondandSilk trouble
@mexican4trump Just refuse to pay people. They can't jail all of us.
new name #notaffordablecare retweet
wish I could meet you but I'm too poor
Kind of ironic that the plan's name has POS in it!
sux...SMD OBAMA CARE..I will pay my TAX "Penalty" at the end of the year in 2017...Unless TRUMP IS POTUS
@DiamondandSilk The deductibles are awful. Paying for insurance you can never use bc can't pay deductible.
@DiamondandSilk Wonder how much the Illegals are paying???
@DiamondandSilk ask why CONGRESS doesn't have OBSMACARE.
@DiamondandSilk OMG - wake up America- we are in desperate need of real change 
@DiamondandSilk Umm, thats a 242% increase.
Correction ... 142% increase. Still preposterous.
Thank GOD Trump is striking this down moments after being sworn in.
Un-freaking real. How is anyone, who is not a friend of Hillary's, supposed to pay that every month?
@DiamondandSilk
@DiamondandSilk vote Trump
plz, when you become President, stop the punishment of fining We the people cause we can't afford it ty
@DiamondandSilk. and they just keep voting for it. WTF is going on
@LindaSuhler HRC really cares about the middle class.
@DiamondandSilk Great Example!! People need to see this in writing!
no donald with all due respect we need to repeal obama care and just allow ins. co.s to cross state lines
pay up!
OMG!!! 
they tried to hide the crushing premium increases. By moving open season to after the election - has always been October
I just have to pay my 3% illegal tax every year and I get nothing. No insurance no nothing. Single Dad of 4 $53k/year. How?
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/24/obama-administration-confirms-double-digit-premium-hikes.html …
happening to us all even without O care, all because of O care. We've got to get rid of it!!
what a colossal failure by Obama. Him and Hillary belong in jail.
are you seriously that stupid or are you just a big sad joke? That pic of insurance letter showed a NON MARKETPLACE plan!
@NobamaDotCom  @FoxNews @Joenbc @BillOReilyTV Send it back to the states. Even MA prices/coverage being affected. #insane
awful. its closing rural hospitals too
This is why we go to http://healthcare.gov  to buy health insurance. It's more affordable. No denial for pre-existing also
Wow...I guess I'd have to take the fine for not having health care. It would save me almost 22K

@jdsweerus JESUS CHRIST OBAMA
Oh goodness. Yes, we do! Pres. Trump #MAGA
Might has well have been $18,072.17 a month...LoL Good grief
It tripled from 2010 to 2014. Company had to down grade employees.
this is not acceptable and quite frankly, appalling, to say the very least !
it says right on the letter that this is not a Marketplace plan-
my monthly premium is $19 though.
if this doesn't get repealed I will not be able to survive with that kind of an increase
Hiliary with Obama Care is about making America poor & the poor poorer with No middle class.
how can you even make a living with those outrageous rates??? Most people don't even make that much a month!!!
good lord people, we need to let America know. That we stand for Trump. hit the polls any poll and don't stop. Trump/Pence
FFS shut up.
compare this to real people. This is higher than my Morgage People can not afford Health Insurance and have a home.
I could not afford last years!
Obamacare insured millions more ppl and reduced the ways insurance companies can screw us. Now let's get rid of insurance!
I'm a case management and insurance nurse.  Our system is severely messed up.... then to force it on people? Fined really?
This is why Jonathan Gruber said 'Dems need to lie to 'dumb Americans' to pass ObamaCare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adrdmmh7bMo …
And if Hillary gets her way --forget it people. Deep shit.
@lovingmykids65 @realDonaldTrump @PooberKitty This right here is reason enough to vote for Trump! ACA is ruining middle class!
@ANON_VETERAN glad I got my coverage through my Union...
That was the best way to go. I just feel bad for so many who cant affors it and didn't keep their original DR.
@obriensarahj01   My rates have increased too!!!
HE HAD BRASS BALLS WITH HIS PLAN
@leelamchop @RealJamesWoods @TeamTrump  @EricTrump Genious Video #MAGA See @Darren32895836's Twt:
BREAKING NEW Video Of Perfect Memory Hillary Clinton Warning staff in 2010 NEVER 2Use Private Server/Email!! #FridayFeeling Donald Trump 
pay high price for insurance; pay ALL pays NOT co-pays; get denials too quick for PT; providers get paid poorly
This is not sustainable. The average #American can barely pay the $700 pm....so we sacrifice to support the #insurance cos?
don't just drain the swamp...cage the gators and snakes and send them to the north pole
@CNNPolitics @TheFive @megynkelly @patmcdonoughmd2 @TPPatriots
everything that's being blamed on Obama Care was happening with insurance prior to Obamacare
@HillaryClinton  How will everyday day Americans afford these premiums? #vote2016 #Maddchaos
please - this is awful!! people cannot afford 700 a month - but 1900??? this ROBBERY ... #RepealObamacare
@MarcAlvarez31    Holy shit!   Thanks @POTUS and @HillaryClinton.  #AlSmithDinner #RepealObamacare #DrainTheSwamp #RIGGED
repeal
no way I could ever afford that
@vandives @realDonaldTrump hey
Palosi and Harry Read said we have to pass it before we can read it! Well read it and weep! Not one republican voted for it
what is your plan? You are never specific about anything. Voting for you it's like a shot in the dark.
Terrible that for a rich country the US has no type of NHS system. I have many American friends who struggle due to this
its says right on the bill that it ISNT a market place plan.
Affordable Care Act sold by straight lying to the American people. Obamacare = Socialism. Pay more get less=Redistribution
Obamacare was a scam from the start. Anything that the vile Nancy Pelosi touts is never good for the American people
this letter literally states that that isn't a marketplace plan......
