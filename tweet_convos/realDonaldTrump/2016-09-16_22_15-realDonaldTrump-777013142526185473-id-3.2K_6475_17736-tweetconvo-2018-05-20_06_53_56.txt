You only hear what you want Trump. "The Worst Of Politics" - Also, where's your tax returns?
@washingtonpost RACIST POS
@washingtonpost lowlife Hitler not fit to wipe the shoes of our @POTUS BEST HUMAN AND POTUS EVER #NEVERTRUMPKKKHITLER
- Does it matter where Obama was born - he is a murderer and he is sitting in the Plantation house.
Are you patting yourself on the back once again as as your custom vinyl?
@washingtonpost a chess game may not make sense until the winner makes his final move. That takes brilliance.
One of HRC campain workers emailed HRC back in 2004 and asked the question. Was Barack born in the U.S.A.
@washingtonpost  trump is posting articles making fun of him simply because he only reads the headlines.
@Scrufey21 @TheFix — Still don't get it.
Nice try.  It wasn't a trick.  As usual, your racist attempts are squashed as you tried to bring down the POTUS. Weasel....
sickening
# Nope It was the greatest display of Racism that I have ever seen. It reminds me of hitler when he first started
haven't read the article, but I'm pretty sure they're calling you a pathological liar. Or in your own words, dopey
Well, now it's the 2nd greatest, after the hijacking of the 2016 election.
@washingtonpost. You truly have no shame.
I was proven that Hillary's campaign staff started the birther rumor. Are the Democrats not admit that fact?
@TheFix  Dunning Kroger effect, your followers aren't smart enough to know they're not smart. You play them well. Poor USA.
@Trumpnado2016 @washingtonpost #cheetolini is the biggest con man in the world today. People still voted for him. #resist
How did that childish stunt play out for you. Miscalculations like that are far more costly as POTUS
SHOW THE DAMN TAX RETURNS
@washingtonpost. You're such scum Nice way to plug your hotel that I'm sure will go bankruptShow your tax returns. Scared?
You got out of the plot real fast, when react it drags for ever, this time, it didn't work, you were out in no time. thanks
@washingtonpost do u ever actually read the articles abt u that u retweet? It called u a liar & a circus performer, genius
like a boss @TheFix -Chris @HillaryClinton is the original birther & both Barrak & Michelle admitted it-do your research
HRC fired staffer. GOP weaponized. DJT tried to destroy PBO, rode to GOP candidacy.
@L8ShowColbert just destroyed @realDonaldTrump and it was beautiful. Donald is such a LOSER. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byP7XvzFqRc …
@washingtonpost or maybe not have a penis the size of ant! He is a fraudster whom the Dems should INSIST fullon investigate
@washingtonpost  Truth is without his maybe billions!! all he is is an over spray tanned pregnant looking man who may...
@washingtonpost  I am still trying to find out where #Inflatabledonald has gotten  that massive, grotesque ego of his.
U are so vain and obtuse, you think this is a compliment.
WHY'd U EVER brag about THIS? UR NOT Don Rickles & even if U were, racist jokes have been in the trash bin of history 4 yrs
That was a great endorsement!  Go Trump!
@TheFix you don't play games or " tricks" aka lies with people . What is wrong with you? Seems to be a mental illness.
@washingtonpost Is @realDonaldTrump   dumb? Or he thinks voters are? "A low moment for politics", "a nothing-burger filled with falsehoods"
@TheFix it's just another example of him flip flopping and lying! Do you ever tell the truth?! And your lies are so blatant
...he is a trickster and a liar for sure!
@TheFix It just proves how racist you are.
Trump lies so much that Politifact named him the Liar of the Year. There were false to pants on fire lies
http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/hillary-clinton-wasnt-a-birther/ …
@TheFix 
How can you mistake criticism as a complement?
video clips showing u saying that he need birth certificate & he showed it 2 u did u pay people find out it was a fake/not
@TheFix Umm, it's not really a compliment.
Actually it just proved to voters what a liar, conman &fraud you are!! #showusyourtaxreturns
@TheFix http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/12/donald-trumps-business-failures-election-2016-486091.html …
@washingtonpost genius!  That's who we want as Prez!
@washingtonpost Did you notice that article you tweeted called you a liar?  Clueless orange mess.
@TheFix they mean that in a bad way.  You are not running for Attention Jester.  You are running for President.
Why are you proud of this?! @realDonaldTrump
@washingtonpost Why don't you speak about your immigrant mother? Praying for LOVE to fill your heart. #LoveTrumpsHate
@TheFix You're excrement.
LOL JK LAST FIVE YEARS I'M A NOT A CHILDISH ASSHOLE MAKE ME PRESIDENT I HAVE MONIES @jimmyfallon TUSSLED MY HAIR I'M NORMAL
Blaming it on Hillary when you started it and your followers believe your bull smack!
and you're proud of tricking the American people? I wonder what you're going to answer during the debate. #Birthernotgone
@TheFix Do you agree? I have magician at my 4 year olds bday doing more magic than this guy. #suckers
@washingtonpost sooooo presidential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sBhANSz--k …
@TheFix that was great!Had all the networks in limbo for at least 30 mins.I have forgotten now, but checked them to time it
@washingtonpost Still better than Hillary.
@TheFix No one with a brain believes Trumps ongoing con.
@washingtonpost you're proud of spreading misinformation.  What a sick person you are.
Always blaming others fro your words..makes you blind to you being the real problem
@realproblemDonaldTrump
Trump you cant undo the past..stop blaming other for your own racist mistakes
Playing the victim is a sign of immaturity..take responsiblity for your own lies
pretty funny wil any one believe this low level huckster..blames his own racist comments on Hillary..pathetic
Trump thinks his racist birtherism is behind him  he admits the obvious.all it  proves is he is DEPLORABLE
Donald Trump the lying racist..he finally admits both..still a pos
That's because you are a trickster. All you care is for attention and fame and don't give a hoot about the people or USA.
IF HE PULLED OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST HE MIGHT HAVE MORE CREDIBILITY!  THIS IS BAD WRONG IN USA!
You are #Pathetic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sBhANSz--k …
You have to be able to READ the certificate
he will only read the headlines of intelligence briefings, too?  How shallow. How stupid...
@washingtonpost He really does have tiny hands. Now I understand what everyone is talking about!
If Trump is elected, that would be the biggest trick that anyone has pulled on the American public
@realDonaldTrump
What is wrong with you? You're an embarrassment. The only trick you've ever pulled is #melania. #DumpTrump
@CNN @CNNPolitics @MSN @MSNBC @ABC @ABCPolitics @CBSNews @CBSEveningNews @NBCNews does anyone in the media have a backbone?
@washingtonpost thanks for tell us what we all knew all those years you were promoting the birther idea.
Is this your proudest moment?
I love it! You out smarted them, as I knew you would. Most intelligent man you are.
@TheFix WHAT A CONMAN 
Donald J. “Jerk” Trump:
      Never wrong
      Never sorry
      Never responsible
@washingtonpost Trump used the Vets to advertise his new hotel. What a scumbag!!!!

Loved it.
@TheFix Ya u would celebrate that! ARMAGEDDON maybe it is time for the USA to get what it deserves! Sad like losing family
I agree!!! "Birther Trick" was a slick marketing scheme put on by Trump to promote own Hotel, in DC.
.@realDonaldTrump Uh, did you read the article? Or do you not do that 'reading' thing,
Say what you need to say Trump. I think "He is Illegal." and His Birth certificate is phony.
EVIDENCE of HOW U wld make jobs for America, along with ALL the ppl you didn't pay #VoteHillary #DumpTrump
#ManyPeopleAreSaying @realDonaldTrump has the most swollen swelled head on earth!
we love you President Trump!
@washingtonpost you are truly a crook!
It wasn't a compliment, dummy.
@PeriwinkleDsgns @TheFix finally got the LIBERAL MEDIA to cover him accurately except for their lies after the fact
@washingtonpost  Yet another reason not to vote for @realDonaldTrump
Is that Obamas brother?
It was proven that it came from Hillary's campaign staff
it is no trick, it just shows how big a moron you have always been
These stupid people have vastly under-estimated Mr Trump. What utter morons.
So this tweet shows that you only read the headlines and not the article itself #DumpTrump
Good 4 him!  Now what's the lib media going 2 focus on? Oh, I know -- the word "bomb" even though Killary said "bombings."
'Birtherism is just 1 in a long list of half-baked, historically inaccurate attacks
http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/birtherism-is-just-the-beginning-a-long-list-of-trump-conspiracies …
Article it should not be taken as a compliment.!  Just the falsehoods lies that you tell
Psychopathic thinking. Takes one to know one...  @JoeBiden @mcuban
well, how about the press remembering who really said it first: 
     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M7Rp_Ghv6k …
@TheFix Obama taking a month off to campaign for Hillary?  Shady

Trump put all these Black folks in a position to promote him. I have not seen one person. As soon as he lose they are FIRED
You are proud of this?   " It was a low moment for politics and political coverage"
remb when you sent pi's to Hawaii to find out your pres's origins and we're finding 'many interesting things? 4 years ago?
you're proud of this? #smallhands
You see all those zombies in the back of the real fraudster,they look like puppets.What a shame for us all!!!
You didn't read it, did you? #SomePeopleAreSaying that you can't read. Is it true? If so - #Unqualified
This shows the Orange Con Man for what he is
you said you would give 1K to a charity of Obama' choice if he was American. Where is it?
see that?  "Donald Trump's Birther movement."  It didn't say Hillary Clinton.
share the horrible experience you dragged widow vera cokling through in AC.  YOU LOST THAT CASE!
where are your tax returns?  Where are your foundation records?
It just makes you Lyin' Donald.
Great job.  I am sure they loved it...not! LOL
@washingtonpost Mr TRUMP. That was a masterful use of media! Good job! GREAT thinking! Congrats!!!
you realize, Don the con, this was not a compliment to you, right? Not that bright, are you?
You didn't read the article, did you, 'nothing burger'? #DonTheCon #UnfitForCommand
@washingtonpost and who's gonna pay for the free advertising? The Foxicans
#WomenCanStopTrump
MSM-ocreTaper repeats same robotic DDuke? LiB MSM  Cult members parrot same AdjDujour. Throw curve balls back@them Wincing!
spreading racist birther propaganda for 5 years doesn't just go away because you need black votes one day and say u r sorry
as if somehow becuz u need black votes u think blacks will vote 4 u when u spent 5 years spreading racist Birther hysteria
Brilliant move! You triggered the entire MSM by beating them @ their own game & it was great watching them throw tantrums.
Pure Genius!
Post is just upset because Our next President played them and all media like a fiddle!
@TheFix  please tell me a disappearing act is next. #byeTrump 
@washingtonpost a trick is still a trick, you little trickster you...you...you...you little trickster,
@TheFix but will @realDonaldTrump make good on his $5M donation 2 charity now that he is "assured" that @POTUS was is US born? Probably Not!
loved it! U turned the tables on our dishonest media!
you know, these aren't compliments.
you don't even get it is a criticism of your lies.
You realize @realDonaldTrump that this article is pointing out what a pathological liar you are? You think 'greatest ever' is a compliment?
This wasn't a compliment Mr. Trump
I loved it
@DanaBashCNN he's talking about u. but go ahead & do the false equivalencies. you should "report" for @etnow
you realize you just retweeted an article that labels you as a "great" liar right?
SCREW the dishonest media!  They deserved it!
I wonder where @HillaryClinton got this idea..
The media was 'dooped' into giving the veterans air time....Great play Donald!
Was a liar then, is a liar now.
...... and the pundits still don't get it!!!!
@washingtonpost Radiation BUURRRN! Truly funny. Take it easy though were close.
Biggest bullshit artist ever. That's not a compliment. Most unqualified person ever to run for president.
@trumpflorida16 @washingtonpost loved the speech!
@washingtonpost  then men in white coats need to come get you
Yes you played the media the public and the RNC to whom you will charge this.  F.E.C. WHERE ARE YOU!!!!!!!!!!
It wasnt a trick.....there was nothing more to say than what he said....."How long is a press conference suppose to be?"
Just read "Bombshell:" "Washington Post Confirms Hillary Clinton Started the Birther Movement."
You claim to be brilliant, thought this was a compliment? Pathetic! #DonTheCon #FRAUD #TheWorldAccordingToTrump
trick? Or stupidity. Don't u  no u have 2 be an American to run for president? OMG you are like a gerbil running on a wheel

MR.TRUMP, YOUR PHOTO + CAPTION/COMMENT SAY IT ALL, UNFORTUNATELY, FOR THE U.S.A. AND WORLD.  YOU'RE THE CRAP RUNNING 4 PRES
@washingtonpost  funny you should call it another TRICK.   The DEVIL is a TRICKSTER !!
Delete your account
How dumb is Trump? Dumb enough to think WaPo is  braggina on him when they're ragging on him. lol
He probably didn't read the article because there are lots of words; some big words too.
Obviously neither of you understand
the word #irony, or the narcissistic sociopath implications of RT this
They won't trust you next time.
Meaning, that you are a con-artist, you small-handed fucktrumpet.
lol this article destroys him and he reposted it because of the title without reading the content 
"It was a low moment for politics and political coverage. A nothing-burger filled with falsehoods..."
This isn't praise 
@washingtonpost
