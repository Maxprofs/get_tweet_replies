#CrookedHillary Wants to RAISE taxes. #HillNo #NeverHillary
@DarkStream @mike_pence Well, Not surprised, always the "money" with HRC it's Silver or Lead #ClintonCartel
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence again I'm not a groupy or crazy, just want u 2 win. I believe we won't have a country if ur not pres
Notice how Hillary's eyes point in different directions? She is profoundly unfit for office.
Unfit cause her eyes point in dif directions?Then Trump's unfit cause he's orange
Did u like how she lied about Libya genocide, murdered Gaddafi and laughed about it? Proud of that?
@WashTimes and some claim veterans want Hillary as POTUS 2be continually screwed
Tell that to the families of all the black people who have been shot by blameless white officers.
And, in far too many cases...are also the WORST of us. Pretending there's NO problem is irresponsible.
there wouldn't be a problem if EVERYONE respected authority the way they should!!!!!!
And by 'EVERONE'...I'll assume you mean POC. There...is...a...problem.
no... Actually by EVERYONE... Kinda meant EVERYONE... What the hell does POC have to do with it??
Pretty sure POC have everything to do with it. Therein seems to lie the problem and disconnect.
why exactly do u feel that way? And why is it ok for u to assume EVERYONE feels that way??
I feel that way because I follow the news and do research. You can feel any way you choose.
that means get on the ground! That doesn't mean put ur hands in the air and walk backwards...
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence this is the only way I can talk 2 u . but I watch u on tv & I really wish I could talk on the phone
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Law & Order for  the  RAPIST
"Asset forfeitures"...
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/ …
Law enforcement officers are seeing reality.  Good for them.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence. Me again lol. But really there are just a few things I need to say that I won't over Twitter. Pres.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence & if we want 2 keep them we will have 2 have u up there as r president. Love you president Trump.

@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence so excitedhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154739983666336&id=15704546335
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence that's right.
Good in shooting unarmed US citizens. But then, what do you care?
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence even the one who recently killed an autistic child? http://m.nydailynews.com/news/national/feud-led-police-shoot-autistic-la-boy-cops-article-1.2429869 …
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Just like "Hood Wink em Hilary " this guy is a vile creep puppet.
Tell em just like guiding the Trump business through tuff times to  world class brand you will fix broken America & great again
So make it a force of good. You want "law and order" that should apply to police TOO. Serve ALL ppl.
Thank you LAW ENFORCEMENT!

thank you Sir! We need you as our President and Gov Pence as our Vice-president
YES A FORCE OF LETHAL SOLUTIONS
@pjdl1968 @mike_pence Dream on.
Not a dream, it's your not POTUS 2016
how does Hilary get a pass on her implicit bias comment.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence  LOL JUST STRAIGHT CLOWNS
God bless the Trump Team!
When you don't pay taxes, police are underpaid, so you get what you get.  Not necessarily the best.
Sheet.  I grew up in New Orleans, and I can tell you that is a lie.
There was to be an exchange. Embassy employees for the Sheik. Obama had no other way to free him without outcry!
It involved jailed blind Sheik and Obama buddy Morsi who desperately wanted him free & in Egypt. No violence intended
Did you ever hear  kidnapping gone awry story re Benghazi? I heard it night of attack but not since. Now makes sense!
Am I correctly remembering that Obama invited/asked for Putin's help in Syria? Should have destroyed airfields first!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence GOOD Police officers are the BEST. Realize that there are incompetent and corrupt police out there
Absolutely!
stop tweeting so much we all love anyway
Don't tell Americans USA is a country, it's not.

@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence 
Sorry Don, I am as good as any police officer and I find that you most likely are not.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence The military is the best of us...the military YOU refused to join
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Thanks
put your money where your mouth is Trump never pays Taxes so doesn't support police,
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence.  Mostly, yes.  What's your point, mindless panderer?
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence 

@timkaine was annoying the whole debate. He was rude interrupting the Pence & the moderator
because That way you don't need the army to go out to kill blacks and Hispanics for you?
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence except when it's not
Cops go into neighborhoods with a bullseye on them by wearing a uniform. Leave the cops alone!
@LindaSuhler   Love it
innocent until proven guilty applies to all, incl officers.  @HillaryClinton @BarackObama  disagree.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence except when they kill innocent people.
#BlueLivesMatter #MAGA
@JasonMillerinDC @mike_pence  I cant understand how Hillarys crew doesn't support this same sentiment
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Thank you to our LAW ENFORCEMENT! And #TrumpPence2016 for reminding us not to take them for granted!
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AND STOP AND FRISK IS A EXCELLENT TOOL FOR
LAW
No news there for us. But, you will make it more dangerous for them by inciting so much violence.
Everytime they Go Out on a Call, their Lives are on The Line!!
Where are your tax returns?
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence you have to be really brave to make yourself a target like police do! Bcuz of #BLM police r n danger
@Fortepiecat @mike_pence
ABSOLUTELY! Obama and Killary are the race baiters! They are the ones that are encouraging killing of our police!
@lgmaterna @mike_pence Clinton&Kaine have no respect for police officers!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence hahahaha so show us your tax returns duplicitous Donald
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence BUT CROOKED HILLARY DOESN'T SEE'S IT THIS WAY,  SHE FEELS IT'S OKAY  BLACKS KILL EACH OTHER.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence tell me Don does twitter pay you by the tweet? You are sooo weak.
@realDonaldTrump  wish Trump was so prepared last debate
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Good Police officers are the best of us.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence women should be able to make their own choice!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence loosing on all fronts
not all of them...kind of like those Mexicans where you said, "and some I guess are good people."
Kaine a Jesuit raised boy.  No wonder he looks such that I would not want my children babysat by him
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence love it Pence is the Best.
“@TeamTrump: “Police officers are the BEST of us. Law enforcement in this country is a force for GOOD." - HELP support them, PAY your taxes!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Law enforcement is paid with taxes!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence HILLARY uses "a hammer" to secure her security concerns!!!!

@realDonaldTrump @BRAVO PENCE Terrific examples brought into discussion!
Stop and frisk is not a force for good. It violates unreasonable search and seizure.
That's an objectively false statement. Cops murder, deal drugs, rape, and "I guess some of them are decent ppl."
pretty sad state of affairs when the "BEST" of us are so busy killing rest of us...
and if vthe Police are the ones to break the law are they still the best of us?!
lmao what a lie!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Pence is showing more like an adult and Kaine is acting like and lying like a child
I agree but their are some bad ones sprinkled in throughout the country that needs to be weeded out @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence I agree
Torally ignorant, ignoring, or covering up the bias against African-Americans. #BlackLivesMatter #VPDebate

Then why are they under trained? Why do they keep killing black people?
@realDonaldTrump  how the Hell would you know??
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Even the police that kill innocent Americans? Your comments are very disturbing w/ blanket approval.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence PENCE CLEARLY SHOWS GREAT LEADERSHIP AND CLEAR MIND!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence ...some ARE the best...some are not..we need to recognize the need to purge the force of the abusers

@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence "BRAVO PENCE HOLDS HIS OWN IN THE "RIGHT & JUST!"
Racists!
The moderation is so biased.  She is a Democrat. Not letting him answer on cybersecurity AMAZING!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
wish the moderator would shut up and let Pence speak, she let's Kaine speak, incohertently.
@realDonaldTrump And we are proud of our men in blue
@SteveGarvey6 @mike_pence nobody on either side saying anything different Steve. Bipartisan support. Not a "trump" issue.
Kaine has to interrupt because he has no argument.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence The newscaster isn't doing a fair job!
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence except when theyre not
Please , vote Hillary
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence have you had to have the black father's talk with your son's.  Do you know what it is?
Kaine is very dull and knows nothing about intelligence real or governmental.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence it's a shame to say not all.  Have you ever been pulled over for "Driving Black" I bet not.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence very knowledgeable
How can a woman who violated email security lecture us on cybersecurity.  And why have they not done so yet?
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence                 Black. Lives. Matter.
Kaine needs an intelligence surge to tie his shoes.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence your Pets have no free will.dummy Satan is spinning you a cocktail DON'T drink Hillary's koolaide
@realDonaldTrump is the worst of us. Show u have a pair and disclose your taxes. @mike_pence was a terrible IN governor.
Pence makes great points  wish he would bring up that Hill led birther movement.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence you can't be real lol
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence thanks and that's the truth.

@realDonaldTrump does this debate have a moderator
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence as for Hilary about your taxes simply reply you have contributed millions to the good of America.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence 
Hit this Fraud for*flipping*on Career Long ProLife Stance until making Devil-Deal 4VP with Hillary!

Remember when @realDonaldTrump said if he's elected, he'll get GOOD law enforcement and GOOD military?
emails  obstruction , lie FBI, bleach bit
& drumpf, pence, guilliani, christie, palin, carson are the ultimate force of EVIL
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence  We love Donald J Trump our NEXT President of the United states Hello!
They're also the worst, and until you can name the enemy, you can't defeat it.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence BRAVO PENCE gave focus and purpose to future goals and successful results possible!
Pence is great and if you pick people half as great in your administration we win.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence maybe our officers should pull out of inner cities. Let the gangs run things lol liberals are funny.

@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence first positive thought you have had.  They risk their lives daily as do firefighters
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Maine doesn't want to give pence his freedom of speech
the reason some people hate police is because they are doing criminal actions n think cops are out to get them
Kaine is all over the place. He's too agitated to even make sense.
Kaine is so twisted. He has no clue what Hillary has done. He invents scenarios that are delusional.
@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Such a shame that @HillaryClinton & @timkaine have such disregard for #BlueLivesMatter
You and Mr. Trump know people use a broad brush to paint officers with "implicit bias" , seizing on
