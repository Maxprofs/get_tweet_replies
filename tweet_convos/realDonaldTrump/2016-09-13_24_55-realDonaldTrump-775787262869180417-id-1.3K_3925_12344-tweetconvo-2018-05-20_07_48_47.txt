The continued disrespect of White Supremacy in America towards African Americans
"white supremacy" is now just a flag and some offensive tweets??? These neo-PC "students" need to get a life.
I'm not buying what you're selling and the people in Flint are not buying it either ...
sorry to  shatter your narrative, but the Flint crisis is yet another "Democrat" party blunder.
You clearly know nothing about Detroit or Flint. It was white flight caused by racist fear mongering politicians
"white flight" caused the water to get poisoned? That's a new one to me.
No when the white people left the Republicans stopped caring about the water,told you you know nothing
pretty sure Flint and Detroit has been run by democrats....
you are nothing compared to hillary, she has helped millions of kods
I laugh at these ignorant trump supporters
i have seen so many brainless people in my mentions that it makes me angry
I've seen loads of trump supporting white supremacists
i've seen a lot of black supporters calling "black lives matter" racist and acting like one
they're whitewashed fools
and their supporters can't accept facts!
exactly, all they do is pull false shit out of their ass
does the Secret Service refer to your father as agent orange?
why do racists try to deflect and call others racists? Oh, a trump supporter
what race is orange?
you lack the mental capacity to form a cohesive argument. Ask someone to explain it to you!
sorry, wrong number. Please hang up and try again.
is Ivanka the new Miss Trump, wheres Melania?
Awful plan! Poorly written and no way to pay for it -
- More food stamps? Stop the bombing of other children abroad, and you have plenty of money.
Ban Pressure Cookers!
The Emperor  (Obama) is wearing No clothes!!  We are the at war!! He is so  clueless!!
We need Mr.Trump he is a person who is real and sincere. Glad you are by his side.
Hope he's getting sleep.
Can't wait until he loses and we don't have to hear from any of you again.
be glad when Clinton in jail to where she belongs
WHAT ARE HER QUALIFICATIONS? Being a Barbie look alike?
Brilliant move, Dems blindsided, poor already have assistance. @IvankaTrump Taking care of working mom's. Yes! @realDonaldTrump
Looking for support?. Here ya go.
Daddy
thank you for being a woman champion.
a family of narcissists who refer to themselves in the third person. Cheese hasn't fallen far from the #cheeto
#trustfundbaby #cheetojesus @realDonaldTrump is proof that millions of Americans are prepared to throw their country under a bus
A conspiracy nut like #trustfundbaby @realDonaldTrump would wonder about the timing of recent bombs ahead of a major election.
Is it weird, @IvankaTrump, that your Dad #lyin' @realDonaldTrump wants to bone you?
That must be so #creepy

#Loser
what is your position on possibly making pre-school public?  So many fall behind bc parents can't afford it...
@Latinos4Trump16 @realDonaldTrump Please help Mr Trump prepare next time for the next debate.He should mow her down

Hillary has helped thousands while Trump stiffed thousands. #LOSER
Your pretty much a true nut job.
Have you had a Bromance with Trump the Rapist, Con Artist, Biggot & Putin Worshipper for a long time?  #TinyHands
great efforts by Ivanka ...wake up USA that is  more than Michelle Obama has done for 8 years...

TRUMP CAMPAIGN CEO..BANNON.. WROTE THIS..TRUMPS IDEA OF A CHOICE GUY
Couldn't take the heat though.  Apple doesn't fall far from the tree
@ABC @CBS @NBC @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews Ivanka rocks!!!!! #TrumpPence2016 #MAGA #NeverHillary
your dad is missing golden opportunities to put a nail in her coffin
that statement is truly frightening.
What do u folks care about child care. No working stiffs could afford nannys like u folks. GET REAL.
That's very okay.
Please explain where the innovation is? @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump
Hillary has a great plan which you basically stole during RNC.
@JasonDovEsq @JasonMillerinDC this Issue won't Rally the Conservative Base- Time for IVANKA to Articulate CONSERVATIVE ideals
why are you so pessimistic? 
The over privileged daughter of a " billionaire" can really relate to working women
like Michelle does huh?????  Meanwhile is your life better?
You're doing a wonderful job for our Future President, Kellyanne! 
good idea muke dem's platform and make parents happier win win
GREAT STUFF IVANKA!!!

How can someone be prejudice against orange and call people racist? Liberal logic
ivanka sucks
Tie it to work/effort put forth n I have no problem. If just another handout for the slothful then no.
they better do something soon for Children and disabilities. Our credit scores get beat to death from it.
God Bless and God Speed to your family today.
deplorable is mild to what most people in the world think.
merica' fuck yeah!! Hahaha it's hilarious how u think that you're special.
ths is totally embarrassing for libs. Blacks, Hispanics now women jumping on the #trumptrain haha @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump
make sure u wear a crash helmet Nov 8th so ur head doesn't xplode.  @puppymnkey @IvankaTrump #trumptrain All aboard to prosperity
but she can't answer questions about her fathers negative comments about pregnant women?
no to more government
bogus. if real, let me see it in any of your enterprises

which is bullshit.
lets grow government, and take more money away from businesses what ever happened to personal responsibility
#Not innovative. Good try. B for effort
You mean the one that doesn't include all legally married same sex couples. The one Donald NEVER had in his?
Here's a new child care policy:
Don't expect the rest of us to pay for your kids
(aka your hobby)
http://Iwillvote.com 

Do you want this person looking after your children?
Please join the Donald
childcare is a big part of getting people back to work. I have another "best idea ever" and no one has said this. Can we talk?
Stick to cloths,Ivana. Youre not cut For this!
ironic considering she supports a rapist 
performance piece on @DrOz was a joke. Way to prove your both #douches. #winning
You were so classy on @DrOz supporting @realDonaldTrump Women salute your fight for American mothers, childcare, seniors, truth
really innovative? I thought it was Hillary's.
not innovative when you left out fathers.
too bad your dress makers didn't receive paid maternity leave! Cheap skate just like Daddy
we need your dad. He will run this country like a business
do they have a child together yet? get Zika first! We need a little kumquat headed kid walking around #goaway
-Why are taxpayers being asked by Mr. Trump to pay for a woman's 6 weeks of child leave. That is her jobs roll.
How can you talk about child care you have nannies, you can go away now!
please tell your dad to be careful I heard you might go to Chicago South Side and that's awful dangerous
innovative? What a joke.
what a joke
It's so sweet to see you two together.  The looks of love, the hugs, the inappropriate groping...
If UR name wasn't @IvankaTrump do U really think that anyone would give a damn what UR opinions R? That would be NO!
Hillary's plan came out in May...and much better... Check it out!
Why should I pay for your kids daycare?
she would be the REAL FLOTUS wink wink.
@TrumpBrexit @realDonaldTrump toda coherencia es importante, para respaldar el propósito de la oferta. Buena idea.
It’s literally right here: http://hrc.io/2cCVg1S  https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/st …
.@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump more #TrumpLies more #TrumpBullshit! #DonTheCon
is a liar just like @realDonaldTrump. Innovative? That's laughable. There is nothing innovative there.
Not to state the obvious but it really is kind of hilarious that Ivanka herself can't even be bothered to tweet her own tweets. @IvankaTrump
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-says-pregnancy-is-an-inconvenience-in-the-workplace-a7052286.html …
A man that could not stand up and protect his country now says he is a leader 
Can make America Great Again
a man that could not stand up and fight for his country now says he can run the country BS what a joke
it's nice to see that Trump likes some immigrants. In ivanka's case it must have been because she's white.
so now he acknowledges women's existence with no way to pay for it!
Ivanka is FOS like her father: Trump Enterprises does not provide PAID maternity leave. More T-Rump BS!
Ivanka claims her bigot father is first to propose child care plan, which is a flat-out lie. Wonder where she gets it?
# great voice needed from real heart#world should believe # behaved favor of victory for great man#DonaldTrump
a good policy for all American period
except Hillary Clinton already has a planned outlined and democrats have worked on one for decades...
sounds like another massive welfare program to be paid for by the children it is designed to help.
Who is going to pay for this??  Our country is already in tremendous debt.
You think we can trust you on any women's issues or policy issues, ha! You're as deplorable as your Dad.
@GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump oh you mean like the one Hillary Clinton has had on her website for months?
Too funny - His wife cant join campaign cuz she has 10 yr. old.   Are Ivankas kids chopped liver.
good for you do what you could to get your dad elected
What! - Did you plagiarize Hillary - she posted hers in 2015
Wonderful plan...enjoyed both speeches!!!
why, who the hell is she? What does she know about policy & child care, privileged as she is! Give me a break
plan is insulting please don't try again
Support =entitlement

WE'RE ALL DEMOCRATS NOW!!!

DUMBASSES #NeverTrump #cruzcrew #NeverTrumpOrHillary @gop

Why is Melania in hiding?
Trump supports RAPE in the Military

Go back into your hole with your father!
Only 1 candidate that's proven to broken the law. Trump. He made illegal contribution as to Bondi as bribe and paid a fine.
The new plan helps the "woman who left her child in a hot car to go on a job interview..." how??
start supporting the families at Trump companies
GREAT plan w/child&SENIOR care!2many quitting jobs 2take careof parents or lose inheritance 2nursing homes!
AWESOME!!! Thank you!!! Beyond parties Very Truly Yours AMERICANS!!!!!!!! #Trump2016 #MAGA
You need to catch up on facts  and information first.
stays home to care for grandson. Cost for daycare would cost a lot more for him cause he's 4' 55# in diapers
my husband and I r raising our disabled grandson and state don't help. I'm drawling unemployment and he..
wow throw out a child care bone while you rape the treasury nice work
teachers are wearing black lives matters shirts to school indoctrinating our kids. We need school choice now!
Where was the diversity in PA??? We love Utah Rep. Mia Love, wife, mother and Public Servant! ♡
It's time for that, thank you Ivanka!
so now we have his kids writing his policies for him?  More reality TV
How many times is he going to change his "policy" on this issue of child care?
How many translators?
How many times is he going to change his "policy" on this issue?
I admire and respect you.The plan will will allow more women to go to work & their jobs as mothers will be valued by society.
its Hillery clintons plan !
Great job.
not the govt's job to take care of people's kids!
more liberal big government handouts ! No thanks
Disgraceful lying about Clinton childcare.  Is anyone with the name Trump not a liar??  Horrible.
Saw it.. It was fantastic! Best I ever heard.
just another example of how your dad is a YUUUUUUUUUUUGE government guy...#NeverTrump
great plan! We are behind you and your father!
How many caretakers does Ivan (ka) the Terrible have? She knows less about childcare than   dad knows politics
Dear lVanka, My family is going to enjoy having you as our First Lady!
Hardling "innovative", you know that's been on Hillary's web-site for ages. #theysteelspeechesandideas
think again Donnie boy, think again..
https://youtu.be/mC8bOrmSkE4 
Ivanka, you who had had nothing but A privileged life, four nannies caring of your children, I think not!
Please for all women of and in this country STOP!! Just STOP!

Step back Ivanka, think things over, then precede. I wish you well.
sorry, there is nothing you can do to get the American Women to believe you, it's too late, don't use your
why do you exclude dads from this? 
#releaseYourTaxReturns
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump Latrina the turd eater regurgitates yet another tweet. Ass biter had nothing original
Excellent!

https://www.unitedwaysela.org/stamant 
magnífico
Strange how your Ivanka logo is so similar to Tory Burch. Dad help with that too?
Common Core is hurting our children badly. They are not learning but preparing for state test that's all it is
you were wonderful yesterday & your plan is great. As a mom what we also need is more after school activities.
Where is his wife
Ivanka, I saw you last night along with your father you did a great job and will benefit many many women!
He can't articulate. He needs her to keep the vile rhetoric in ck.However she doesn't even see racist father
I am honored to vote for Mr Trump and I think it awesome you picking up this torch! God bless !
now how about a plan that benefits low-middle income families and NOT THE RICH!!!
Hillary already has one. AnotherTtump LIE.
Be careful U are like your step mother -- PLAGIARIZING - we already know you went to HRC website & read it
. Thank you both for addressing this issue.After 45 years in HR this is the MOST sensible approach ever.
We are not Europe, quit trying to make us Europe. Very disappointing, new entitlements. $20,000,000,000,000
.@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Policies r sexist & harmful to women. Mat leave vs family leave reduces the value of women & hurts careers.
to break poverty/welfare cycle-simultaneously provide temp funds+job/training+childcare+safe home environment
That was some low key, sad, can barely read the teleprompter…crap

Economist Says Trump's Childcare Plan 'Full of Holes' and 'Makes Absolutely No Sense' http://fb.me/1hTFixtJA
