Hillary's corruption and incompetence are so bad all she can do is accuse racism, she's doing it right now
What was Hillary saying about Gaddafi's torture/murder? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmIRYvJQeHM … Is the USA in the business of assassination?
Wow.  You are a true member of the basket.
Wow you support a war criminal who brags about a sovereign leader's murder.
You're so dumb you think it's appropriate for the USA to be assassinating foreign leaders for profit
We didn't assassinate anyone you moron. She has committed no war crime. You are an idiot
Trump is playing the biased media like a fiddle. #DNCleak
hard to play the fiddle with tiny orange fingers
Its hard to do anything when youre having violent, disturbing seizures like Hillary does every day
your meds...triple the dose.
You started birtherism. @POTUS ended it. Now you cowardly blame @HillaryClinton. Run along, fraud. @realDonaldTrump @KatiePavlich
Hillary is afraid to face Trump in a real debate. She cant even stand w/out a team of doctors propping her up
hahaha lol this is funny "people helping her to stand""
Hilarious, isn't it?
NEW VIDEO: Close-up of Hillary's collapse even more disturbing: 
Hillary is unqualified and unfit. She didnt even what the C stood for on classified material! Incompetent!
Nope. Means "confidential," not classified. Lowest class of secure info. Get it straight. #TakeYourMeds
Why are u telling me to get it straight you idiot? LOL Your awful candidate has no idea what it means! You are pathetic.
Well I hope the system is rigged
BRILLANT HAHA SHOW THE TAX RETURNS
Hillary's advisor, Sid Blumenthal, started the #birtherism story. Been dividing America ever since
@YaoMingMtEverst @MSturdahl But who was publicly demanding the BC?if bc said muslim? his transcripts? Hmm?
Trump got obama to come forth when no one else could that's a commanding power.
Bush's, he wasn't running. Everything about Obama is Secretive.No transparency.
If you made sense maybe the conversation would go on until then.
@townhallcom please don't ever use "Trump" and "brilliant" in the same sentence ever again.
Kinda like saying Hillary and truth in the same sentence! Lol
ouch! you really showed me!
Yes..I know..but it don't take much to show a demmy!
why do you make stupid hand gestures while talking?  you have a good sense of humor I'll give ya that
.@realDonaldTrump handily used unwitting supporters as cover for a retraction of his years spreading #Birther innuendo & lies. @KatiePavlich

There is 15 mil$ dedicated to vets charity for you to release taxes. Do you really care about them? Will you?

@townhallcom

hey stupid,yeah you, Mr Circus Peanut, Proud of the fact that you conned so much air time to tell another lie
Hillary made you blink. End of story.
You have a HISTORY of using people, like workers you don't pay. Is that your promise to America?
@townhallcom She lost me when she originally went #NeverTrump
#WomenCanStopTrump
How did it feel to have to admit Obama was born in USA?  Must've stuck in your throat.
Agreed great play!
Nobody, not even Hillary's campaign snipers, had this on their agenda until Bill-O brought it up on his show.

ONLY AN UNSTABLE, UNFIT TO RUN A TOILET, EGOMANIAC CONMAN LIER PSYCOPATHIC SOCIOPATH BULLY THINKS THIS IS OK!
SO, MR.TRUMP, LETS GET THIS STRAIT.  U ARE CELEBRATING/PROMOTING THE FACT THAT U ARE A LYING/BIGOT/CONMAN? HO
How come anyone who agrees with you is "interesting" or "thoughtful," but those who disagree are "failing" and "Sad!"
@townhallcom looks like your puckering up to suck a D in this picture
but...but...he is not a racist

Nice article by Katie, maybe she is more than a pretty face afterall, but she has not been a friend of DJT
@townhallcom whatever/within reason/ it takes to get the message out for those who have something to tell ...
love how the article failed to mention him blaming @HillaryClinton for the birther movement.
@townhallcom What's so brilliant about admitting you're a faker?
Katie's finally on theTrump train.Better late than never.Cruz could not have pulled this off.
You couldn't be satisfied with playing the media like a fiddle, you then have to rub our noses in it.
lets return to the good old days when presidential candidates were not reality TV stars #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
that's because he's ALREADY President! The rest of the government went into hiding last week
If that #Deplorable stunt was #DonaldTrump's most brilliant move, your idea of brilliant is upside down.
Always proving that the circus clown can draw a crowd of fools.  Why aren't your supporters at work?
Trump is a psychopath. Plain and simple.
Nothing brilliant about being a outright racist & liar, a bigot & such low self esteem he has to pull stunts
@townhallcom YOU'RE WEAK
Avoiding questions from the press you insist Hillary won't do herself. Yeah that's genius!
Trump and Brilliant - Oxymoron!
She is a lying deceiving evil woman
I agree whole heartedly-masterful move
TRUMP IS  BRILLIANT  WHAT A GREAT PREZ HE WILL BE
@townhallcom We need a President who's smarter than the media! Everyone knows he's smarter than Mrs. Cough!
Why do half of your photos look like you're fellating an invisible dick or two?
The shape of your mouth resembles another part of the anatomy... and the same "stuff" comes out of it. Shame!
lol

@townhallcom  What you call brilliant,  others call stupid, manipulative and lame.
I was hospitalized when BC was running/a blk nurse hated me 4 being GOP YoungObamaQuaziIntellect"Nee in Kenya

@townhallcom funny America was being ruled by a Kenyan Muslim until as con called Trump said he was American.
.      FLAWless performance!!! MR.TRUMP
@townhallcom  You are honorable & wise Donald J. Trump {Presidential 101}.
The "birther" movement began with #trump as a smear campaign and ended with #trump as the same. To say otherwise is a lie.
damn he's good!!!
@townhallcom HOLY SHIT YOU DROPPED OUT?
YOU were the one who looked like a fool when the press pool didn't give you that free publicity you wanted.
@townhallcom Mr Trump you are a very Hard Working Man and I can't wait to Vote for YOU U &Mr Pence Great Team

http://wapo.st/2cqx934 
.@realDonaldTrump @KatiePavlich Not REALLY so brilliant! Most Americans see through #Trump's bullshit! He's NOT #CommanderInChief material.

#TrickyTrump Bloomberg & Cuban have you pegged as con man & fraud. You have the low IQ low character voter GL
@townhallcom I love it.
Sir that was so beautifully played... Brought tears to my eyes #Hillary must be really pissed!!!
Not Brilliant. Trump's birtherism won;t be forgotten by Monday.  http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html?_r=0 …
@townhallcom you are still the fool 4 staging this press conat least JFK was smart enough to court the press.
Doin'the robot March with the invisible cigar in your mouth. Hey if you don't smoke, why are your lips O'd?
It's not going away, A**hole. Wait till the debates!
"Deplorable": if your show fits ---- and it clearly does --- wear it.  Cont tweeting -- fool
@townhallcom How pathetic, Trump thinks manipulation is a thing to be admired.

Why do you make those zeros with your tiny fingers & thumbs, Donny? Sharing your IQ score? Your net worth?
so you lied about the birther issue for 5 years?
must be so proud to scam press the way you scammed Trump U students #whinylittlebitch
@mindexit @KatiePavlich
@townhallcom how much did you have someone else pay them to be there?
Now that you put an end to your birther movement who are you donating the 5 million dollars to?
It always looked dumb, you would have to be a real fool to have ever believed that.
I loved every second of it.....
during debates will she have an earplug & getting coaching She not only lies but she cheats
@AnthonyJRomano @KatiePavlich Hahaha. #TrumpedbytheTrumpster
Clinton will GET A BUMP UP in ratings over the BIRTHER event. The MEDIA HAS SEEN TO THAT!
: Donald, you snaked em' good!
It was a low moment for politics and political coverage.
I wouldn't call it brilliant. I would call it a clear view of how petty you are

Yuk, with that sickenly gross mouth, he's the biggest turnoff ever. #DontheCon, #PlumpyTrumpy, #TrumptyDumpty
You had to dig around a bit to find some positive spin, didn't you? I bet you have just been stewing all day.
Everyone laughed
"Brilliant" is not the crass misuse of media and candidacy to promote your business.
@townhallcom You Are A racist And a Pathological liar.

@townhallcom IT WAS BRILLIANT!!!
"You're a chump if U don't vote 4 #Trump" if you want jobs, growth, USA pride,GREAT trade deals, self-respect

I think pissing off all MSM less than 2 months before elections is stupid, childish and shortsighted.
Remember this? https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/16/trump-said-hed-give-away-5-million-or-maybe-50-million-for-proof-obama-was-born-in-the-u-s-will-he-pay-it/ …
