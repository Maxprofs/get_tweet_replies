FINALLY SOMEONE WITH BRIGHT EYES!
But with Trump at the helm boats seem to collide?
Guam Governor expresses what many Americans feel too!
Bull.
@realDonaldTrump
fawning fool.
I agree. Thank you
Me Too!
Oh, horse hockey. That comment is not recorded anywhere. It's a Trump lie.
I can't say that same thing about the U.S. and my safety
Then the governor is delusional.
Governors of PR & VI;
Maybe he should talk to comey, the mooch and some of the others he has bailed on
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Americans feel the same way as Guam governor.
such tiny hands
@realDonaldTrump hahah TINY HANDS
We all feel safer with our President Trump in White House @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #MASA #DTS #TrumpTrain #LockHerUp #BuildTheWall #FakeNews
Really?  Have you ever seen the Caine Mutiny?

Ha! Then why did your emergency alarm go off?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHhaha!!!!
Get a room. 
you look like a damn chicken

Dear Sir
#Prophecies_Of_Nostradamus 
#SantRampalJi is
"World-Victorious Saint"…
Bullshit. Plain and simple bullshit.
And with the neo Nazis , the ultra whites and all the rest of that scum on the streets, thanks for that too Mr. President
Still showing hate? Try showing respect.
@realDonaldTrump  if by safer you mean ...closer to nuclear war.
Ddd
I hope Guam doesnt tip over.
Because Trump is the only one unhinged enough to sink North Korea

Funny how Unite the Right Freedom of speech rally became White Supremacists after being attacked by blm and antifa 
Calvo is a master of sarcasm.
@GOP @TheDemocrats @Im_TheAntiTrump #TheResistance
The economy of Guam depends mainly on US military spending and tourist revenue. Of course the governor won't piss off the #fakePOTUS
fake news
I HAVE NEVER FELT SAFER IN MY LIVE AS NOW WITH TRUMP AT THE HELM' Either !!!
narcissist & hypocrite lie. We are scared with Trump ignoramus at the helm
Another sucker-upper.
Thanks for recognizing our great president that's why we trust him
It's nice to have a Pres who shows the utmost respect to military personnel. I'm PROUD of OUR @POTUS TRUMP
Can anybody pull me out of this s alternative universe? How did I even get here?? OMG, there's Ferengi!
Kym says was going to shoot towards, not at... big difference..
@realDonaldTrump Really?  Or more self-serving lies?
Hey Gov you have to say that, you are on the line of fire!
If your boy screw up you are gone!
This proves that there are many idiots at all levels around the world.
How?
HaHaHa!!!! How much more fake news are U going to publicize? Are U paying these people from UR own payroll or are US taxpayers funding this?
Amen!
NO WAY SHOULD ANYONE FEEL SAFE WITH THIS ASSHOLE OF A THING AT THE HELM!! HE IS A BOIL ON AMERICA!! SHAME!! SAD!!
A THOUSAND PERCENT.  ffs
Speaking for all of us!
President Trump  I am proud of you because you refuse to cave to EVIL LIBERALS
Would you consider FDR , Christ .jonas Salk and Buddha evil ?
This is BS
'While you created the accute risk, I'll have my minced reaction so it'll suit your excuse for an agenda.'
Doesn't make you safer.
From Tucker's lips to Trumps hole 
I don't think so!
 Whose idea to make this up??

Fake news
That's a misquote with some creative editing if ever I've seen it. . Fucking hell!!!
what a farce...No he did not. More fake news and lies to mislead citizens.

Did he wear a diaper while making this statement?
Fingers crossed behind his back.
I feel that way too! Best president ever!
I'd believe this statement if it came from the man himself. We are not safe with Trump anywhere much less so at the helm

I'm so super proud of my President. POTUS didn't cave into the PC MSM Socialist narrative supporting facist antifa and racist blm violence 
That's not what he told me.
im sure if u ask him he never said that lies lies lies
Ditto
Sadly this was before realizing the President on the phone was not Obama then promptly hung up
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA and that was for real
Guam governor is crazier than trump!
So true Mr Zpresident
This is the embodiment of fake news
HOGWASH!
He never said that
Hahahahahaha
This is what should be on the news.
And you believed it???? You are even more foolish than I thought.
Yeah.  North Korea threatened to bomb Guam every weekend when Obama was in town ....
Really? Because I've never felt more terrified, uneasy, angry, and disgusted #ImpeachTrumpNow
Do we have the actual recordings?
Seriously crazy talk.
I wonder if this quote is as credible as the nonexistent congratulatory call by the Boy Scouts to congratulate Trump on his partisan rant.
Talk about FAKE NEWS... good Lord!! 
He will eat those words at some point.
You dishonor the military when you use them as a photo op prop.  I'm a 20year vet. Stop it.  Very dishonoring.
UR NUTS
Fake News!!!!!!
Totally Right On

Latina 4Trump!!!.. I feel Safe with president Trump as my Leader!!!..Trump is the Best!!!
If you're not in the military, it's bad form to salute... 
DID YOU MEET PUTIN THERE????
I say THANK YOU  Pres. Trump for standing strong in the face of N. Korea. I APPRECIATE the fact that you don't let lunatics push you around
Trump condemned racism as "evil." Here are 16 times he embraced it:
Hahaha then why is Guam being targeted I feel less safe with trump being around the nuke launch code I would feel safer with a 2 year old
with you at the helm... of a sinking ship. Going down!!!
Is he on crack?
NEW: Fact-checking Trump's misleading tweet about the US nuclear arsenal.
Hahahahahaha. Safer?
No no no, it's "Aaaaauuuugggghhhh" from the back of the throat.

Won't hear that on @CNN


“I’ve investigated hundreds of buildings, but never seen a scheme as egregious and systematic as this one.” https://twitter.com/JesseDrucker/status/897475549056126976 …

Trump cares about sea rise when:
1. There's no Obama directive
2. It's his own golf course (via @SchreckReports):

Is he nuts?
And please don't send me back to Saskatoon, sir!
I will take things that didn't happen for $500
no soldier should salute this asshole,, he doesn't deserve any recognition by our heroes . would you salute a Nazi
So you retweet an article by Tucker Carlson's online "news"?  Now it makes sense why your Saturday response was worded the way it was.
BLAHAHAHAHAHAHAH....*gasp*...BLAHAHAHAHA....secure with TRUMP....BWAHAHAHAHAHA.......*hysterics*......AHAHAHAHA..........STOP!!
And I never felt more terrified than with you at the help.  #tinyhands.
 The Daily Caller, the Enquirer, and Star have ALL shown you having sex with a 13 year old boy. Should we believe it?
Your hair looks worse than usual in that picture.
You tweeted that picture of yourself.
Kudos.
You have left the obsession with hair loss & tiny hands behind you.
Clear to see here.
He didn't say that

Who vetted the Awan Bros?
L Lynch called for blood in the streets. Condemnation? No. The "O" is silent.
Who vetted Valary?
Little Fat Man backs down. More winning
Did you tell them that Americans don't feel the same way?
Awesome President !!
X
Sure that wasn't a quote from Titanic?
Is this another one of those lies you tell?
He handled North Korea like a boss. Nobody plays with the USA anymore.
Did you consider the element of sarcasm?
Fake news
