I’m glad, he is the swamp!
No the Swamp are the liars & spiers who worked with Obama! Obama biggest farce ever pulled on the American people thanks to Socialist Dems.
Carol. Darling. You made poo today. Congratulations.
You made your joke of the day! Funny no ones laughing! MAGA!
Carol. Darling. Good girl. You made poo again. So proud.
You’re the Poo!
Carol. Darling. Making poo twice today. Just like a big girl. #poo #darling
Smelling it up is your job! We’ve had it with you insane hating liberals who don’t see what your doing to our country by protecting illegals
another 
FAILURE
of 
yours

Ask Sen. Joe Manchin how fine a man he is. He flooded W. VA w/opioids.
Hate to break it to you, but no and no.  $.02 drug dealer cashing in while his constituents die.  Antithesis of great.
Except, of course, for his past as a champion of easy access to addictive opioids. You have a knack for choosing the wrong folks for jobs
And he's played a great role in spreading opioids through the country. What a way to make America stoned again.
He's in bed with BIGPHARM. If that's a "fine man",  your're no judge of character. Of course you have no character. #NotMyPresident
Pick me! Retired, disabled veteran, recovering, homeless, widowed father and granddad! Lots of free time!
CNN, MSNBC would have a field day with me! Shake them up, pick me, I've lived it! I'm qualified on paper, loyal, hard working 23 yrs Sr NCO!
Go take ur meds
Glan? Duh! Your name says it all!!
WTF dude? Time to tweet about this but no time to tweet about the situation in Mogadishu? The fallen there, and our brave soldiers...
Really your nominee was Tom Marino 4 drug czar??? The man who was promoting the Opiod epidemic with bogus Legislation. SHAME on you
And in the pocket of the pill pushers. Glad he resigned, saved us the trouble of protesting him.
Thankfully the PRESS exposed this corrupt politician who was nominated by you, a corrupt morn!!!!!
What is he afraid of
Afraid he might actually have to get up in the morning to do some work
And yet again, @realDonaldTrump selects another bad choice.  One bad choice, after another, and another, and another...

He is neither. Nor are you
No, he's not a "fine man" he's as crooked & loaded w/conflicts of interest as you are #LiarInChief
You mean, "Drug Dealer"
.@realDonaldTrump DO SOMETHING about opioid crisis- hold accountable those who testified 2 congress it wasn't addictive knowing it WAS!
The whole situation is a another example of your ill-advised appointments. He's a BAD congressman who values $$$ over people...like you.
and helped pass legislation that flooded this country with opioids! Great job!
Mr. President that is not how you reply to a widow of an American soldier! You need to apologize to that woman that lost her husband!!!!!!!
When will you informing us of your decision to withdraw your name from the list of American presidents?

#RESIGN & seek psychiatric help.
Good. He sponsored a huge bill created by drug companies that helps making it easier for the opioid epidemic to spread and kill more victims
Fine man? Do understand why he’s resigning? Do u even care? He undermined the DEA resulting in death of Americans!
He is an unethical traitor to his constituents in favor of big drugs.  How could you even imagine he could be drug czar?
HE Doesn't want to ruin his career. Well done @RepTomMarino
Another swamp thing bites the dust.... SAD choice to begin with
With the blood of thousands on his hands.
This greedy murderer is “fine”? 
Appears all your "Fine Men" are either crooked, sexual predators, or con artists. You lack good judgment. #Trump
Chronic pain patients are not addicts. We do not get "high" from our meds. We have less pain. Please make an exception for us. #notaddicts.
Baaaaad rubbish!
... and .... a #rich #loyal #Trumper who stole #WeThePeople $$$ for years. @WhiteHouse @FoxNews @foxandfriends
Those kickbacks must be very attractive.
another bad choice bad judgment donald
Nobody with a lick of sense wants to work in your fucked- up administration.
How is he a great congressman who created a law that gave pharmaceutical companies wiggle room and more profit via Opioids.
Well,  good thing.  There aren't any open spots on the "Who's career will be ruin next" board.
I am assuming you think this is full of fine people
You think, he's fine? You thought the White Supremacist & Nazi protestors were fine. You are using the wrong word, you should have said evil
We don't need Emperors. We need secretaries of departments who do their jobs.
We don’t have “czars” in America. We don’t have dictators either. You are delusional. Step down.
Even the National Stock Exchange of India is up by 25% since this year... Even that's because of your "aura"?
Why Czar? Why not secretary or administrator
#predatorinchief
Between withdrawals and resignations you’re having a hard time filling, er, draining the swamp!! #Resist #ResistTrump
A "fine man"? What the fck are you smoking? He's not a fine man, he's on the take from big pharma. Im sure you wouldnt have a prob w/that.
And a crook, it just so happens.
Mr. Marino is R Congressman (PA) & I'm sorry, that he will not be working with you Mr. President. Prayers, 4 U, your family & Administration
A corrupt, unethical man you mean. After the W. Post unmasked him he was not gonna be drug czar. Nope, the swamp wasn’t getting that sludge.
A crook showing favor to another crook.  Isn't that moronic?
Liar LIAR LIAR
Don’t worry, drug companies will give him a lobbying job.
funny that, none but the best
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS  look into this it's disgusting.  CUT THE HEAD OFF PHARMA! Stop the statue of limitations law  @waynerohde
Probably doesn't want to work with you.
When you appointed him, did you think the drug czar's job is to get as many people as possible addicted to drugs? If so, great choice!
STAND UP FOR US...I DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THE POLITICAL BS
Damn, this Russia thing is even worse than I realized.   You are now appointing "Czars?"
All those morons who support this man are in need of a brain transplant n a little of common sense.if they think Dotard T will help them.
#TrumpIsInsane #ImpeachTrumpNow #TrumpIsInsane #ImpeachTrumpNow  #TrumpIsInsane #ImpeachTrumpNow  #TrumpIsInsane #ImpeachTrumpNow

Please Mr. Trump, fix this country
Tom thinks you are a minge.

#minge
POTUS
“ a fine man”?  you picked a man for drug czar  who pushed a bill that kept federal agents from going after the Pharma firms pushing opioids
Just another fine person you know,that sooner or later you’d have let go or fire just like Flynn and others you said were also fine honest
Follow me if you are
He should be arrested
Joe Rannazzisi should be put in charge.
He is a god damn opiate pusher! He has blood on his hands!
Sure he is. That certainly explains his sudden withdrawal. Or, maybe not???
You literally picked a guy who knowingly caused the opioid crisis for profit to combat the opioid crisis. You can't make this shit up.
that tweet was from 8 am
And?
Quit watch 60 Minutes (leftist with creative editing style) years ago. just trying to make CBS relevant in the face of financial losses.
My prayers Mr President Donald J Trump  GREAT JOB! MAGA
President Trump, we all appreciate your hard work on stopping the Opioid epidemic,from being handed out like candy and so many getting addicted which ruins their life, and their families lives.
No other President cared or wanted to take on the giant.#Opioid
ok
He does not want to work with or for an admistration like yours
Definitely not a fine man or great Congressman.
Smart way to weed out ppl. Now get all ob's hold overs out!
You wouldn't know "great" if it slapped you in the face!
How about a black man for the job????
Reports and his voting record show He is pro drug smuggling... wtf were you thinking
Another smart man to withdraw !!!  Who's  next?
Lol. He thought drug czar meant supreme distributor.
That's because no one wants to work with you. And you pick totally unqualified people.
And smart for bailing a sinking ship
Figures you’d use the term Czar. Putin’s Puppet.
Lemme guess he’s a rich white republican
And made money from the opioid crisis.  #FakePresident
He is neither fine nor great!
Liar
To drain swamp trump regime must leave.
With blood on his hands
Marino is a partisan hack.  Good riddance to him.
Typical of your selections, totally inadequate!
Did it have anything to do with that 60 minutes segment? One less Fox guarding the hen house!
You said the same thing about Nazis and the KKK
And you're a good judge of character are you?
He is as fine a man as I am. I know because he said nice things about me. Stroking my fragile ego. #TrumpEgoStroking
Thank you 60 Minutes!
You couldn't be more wrong !  And that is just another statement that proves your judgement is impaired.
Heck I want want to work that close to you. Everyone that does ends up quitting anyway for being fired. That should say something about you.
LMFAO!! You baffoon, the man is corrupt AF!! Watching the GOP epiphany about you will be great, btw. It's coming and nobody deserves it more
Every time you call someone a fine man, they are either being fired or resigning. Usually due to corruption.
Who wants to work with a #fuckingmoron
Prez #StayTuned keeps nominating losers.  Why?  He does no homework.  Tom Marino is far worse than any M13 gang. Thousands OD'ed. All Legal!
Rep. Tom Marino who is a complete embarrassment is withdrawing his name as drug czar.  Tom (as well as the fine neo-Nazis) is a fine man.
The whole idea of the position with the title of czar is pretty freaking stupid, you got to admit, right?
60 Minutes exposed him and @MarshaBlackburn.  No choice but to withdraw.  Now if they both resign we'll be headed in the right direction.
And smart enough to know he is filthy dirty and could not keep getting payouts from Big Pharma in that role.
Not a fine man, he is culpable in the deaths of thousands, as are big pharma and pharma distributors. No integrity, that's why we need regs!
Obvious why Tom Marino withdrew! He’s been in the pocket of big pharma. Totally unfit and downright egregious choice.  Where r ur advisors
Tom is a drug king pin
...who got led around by a bunch of manipulative big pharma lawyers... poor Tom, career ender?
#FAKEPRESIDENT
#Trump please be reminded that you are not just a President of United States but the world as a whole. Please act wisely in handling issues
Rep Tom proposed/supported leg that would have made it more difficult to enforce drug laws. Yeah, great pick, Donnie. Great Guy. Puleeze!!!
And a lobbyist crock
Protecting those 'fine people' again, I see
He’s a great guy, with ties to the mob, in the pocket of pharmaceutical co’s. but voted against medical marijuana for Veterans, deplorable.
Yes - but did you see 60 Minutes?  Wow. He is complicit in the problem. I am glad he withdrew.  It's better for you.
No one wants to work for a liar
He's a sleazy drug pusher, implicated in millions of deaths. Figures he's be your pick.
A great man and Congressman?  He was bought by the drug industry.
Marino facilitated a lot of needless death.  Let's see what congress does now to limit opioids.
Nobody wants their names dragged through your dirt
You have become toxic!
by republican standards, I am sure he is.
"Fine man"...yeah, right.
Moral of the story. Fine men and great congressmen want nothing to do with POTUS. #lyingTrump
#PeepeeTapes #trumpMoron #SteeleDossier #ImpeachTrump
Liar!  He withdrew out of shame for his support of opioid manufacturers & opposition to DEA measures to fight drug abuse.  He's a sick man.
We've heard about people you've called "fine men". Regardless, look at your opioid abuse numbers. Big Pharma, MDs/cos getting kickbacks.
Proves he's at least a smart man.
You tried to put the fox in charge of the hen house! Extreme vetting? Drain the swamp?? A Fine Man? Marino takes opioid money from lobbyist
It's a good thing Marino withdrew. He's not a good man.  He is a paid political whore. He represents the SWAMP you are trying to drain!#MAGA
@RhondaSexton17 stop picking favorable congressmen/senators for these - leave them to help push legislation thru RINOs
And a doper.
Whenever you say someone is a "fine man" their reputation is in the toilet
@realDonaldTrump,
& an opiate Pusherman!
You should nominate El Chapo - he would be a perfect fit to run DEA in your administration!
He didn’t want to join your corrupt rat ship.  He knew what you wanted him to sign up for and have you the finger 
President Trump is the #BestUSPresidentEver
Yeah,yeah,yeah does he get his $$ back now?! Oh yeah do u think Drumbs--t puts these crooks n office 4free?! Put up LG. donation$first
Now it is your turn to withdraw. Your incompetence is wrecking our Country. Putin must be happy with you. Traitor.
And a drug dealer.
Nobody wants to work with u.  I've never seen so many people leave their positions under your presidency.  Good jon
#ImpeachTrumpNow

People leaving you like rats on a sinking ship. Still haven't been able to deliver to Putin. We know how this ends. Buh-bye traitor.
"A congressman accused of helping the pharmaceutical industry flood the United States with addictive opioids." Yeah, fine man--NOT!

Of course he forgot to mention this was the result of an investigation by a company he labels “fake media”.  Free the press. We never rest https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/920268091329859585 …
No, Tom is a self-serving dick who is responsible for the deaths of thousands from OD's that likely could have been avoided.
Another #Loser chosen by a #Moron. #Morontrump #TrumpIsAMoron #TrumpIsAnAss #Loser #Failing #Resist #ResistanceUnited
Can you keep anyone?there all firing you.. don't you see your lies are catching up
More sleeze and slime from Trumpshit traitor his definition of fine people is seen through his grifting,racist eyes
I'm Muslim
You are the worst!! Tell the truth, once.
He's almost as corrupt as you.  #TrumpsTheWorstPresidentEver  #TrumpsTheWorstPresidentEver  #TrumpsTheWorstPresidentEver

You are the swamp. What Failure your is. Hundreds of crucial posts are unfilled because of your incompetence. Ambassador to Iran? Head of Homeland security (oversees FEMA, which you undoubtedly don't know)? #dotheworldafavor #resignnow
#trump leave #whitehouse Disgusting man #sgtladavidjohnson
This is what we call a half-baked appointments process. The media made Trump withdraw his nominee. Loser!
Fifteen times as many people die from diet related illnesses than drugs.

The "War on Drugs" is a racket.
Good. He was a drug Lord for the drug companies. He is part of the swamp!
Who doesn’t want his name attached to you... I wonder why?
Kind of like having the fox guard the henhouse.
Donnie, Matino is a shill for the opioid industry. Of course you don't mind since you are Putin's shill
Lol! Everything you touch is garbage!
Are you NUTS!! This man is a drug czar.
Just more #SwampScum . The entire trump 'administration" is #swampcreatures
...a 'fine' man who is in the pockets of the drug companies, who are killing people. But keep working on that Swamp. Stinky
Yea until tomorrow when your meds flip and he is the worst guy ever.  #heartattack #dumptrump #DonaldTrump #mental #insecurities. #littleego
“CZAR”?! But that’s a Russian title? Your supporters gave Obama endless shit for having “Czars”!
Tom Marino is not a fine man. @realDonaldTrump is a bad judge of character.
@RepTomMarino is to blame for the opioid crisis. JFC - you are filling the WH with thugs!  #Unfit
Do you idiots ever vet people before announcement.  Fucking Morons
Sounds like he's getting out of the business before he's prosecuted. You should take a leaf out if his book.
WhatEVAH. Btw, shut your piehole about Obama. Gold Star families told AP of acts of kindness from 2 presidents - Obama and George W. Bush.
"and it's a damn shame I wasn't able to sneak him in as Drug Czar so he would allow big Pharma to keep killing my voters...."
