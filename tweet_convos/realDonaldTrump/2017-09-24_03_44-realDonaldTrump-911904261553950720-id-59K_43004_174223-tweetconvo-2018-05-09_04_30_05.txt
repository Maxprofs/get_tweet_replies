Just in: NFL players link arms and kneel during the national anthem at the Ravens vs. Jaguars game in London
NFL Players: "No man or woman should ever have to choose a job that forces them to surrender their rights."
Buffalo Bills - Trump's comments are "divisive and disrespectful"

Our message "promote an environment focused on love and equality"
While 3.5 Million U.S. Citizens in Puerto Rico will have no electricity for months?

Trump in some fake invented grudge rant with sports?
Greg Popovich (USAF Ret) - "There's a cloud, a pall over the whole country"

Trump is "embarrassing and damaging to our institutions"
May 17
What a Real President would say

Russia interfered in our election - we must unite to stop it - as Americans!
Trump calls the Russian attack on our democracy "A Hoax"

Sen McCain calls it "an attack on American Democracy"
Trump distracted and distracting on twitter

While Puerto Rico + 3.5 million U.S. citizens lack power in devastation
GET YR FACTS STRAIT, Trump was an only living son! (See Private Ryan)
Bill Clinton DODGED the Draft by FLEEING to Canada, so your point is ?
Bots can't read books.  Nina is a bot.
1232 tweets dating back to match of last year and EVERY SINGLE ONE IS POLITICAL.

Superbot.
Doubling down? Once again: Per 18 US Code Section 227, it is ILLEGAL for the President of the USA to urge companies to fire private citizens
He didn't urge. He was warning what the American public was going to do. Boycott @NFL and their sponsors. We shouldn't be ignored!
"Fire or suspend!" "Tell them to stand!" "...should stand for the national anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!"
Yep because that's what he has seen on our posts. He took heed to our threats. @NFL didn't obviously
Oh please, that isn't what happened and you know it.
We have been tweeting how long about this now? Go back and check it out.
I don't have to. I know how long. And I know you're rationalizing. Trying to justify his calling for a private org to fire people.
You can spin it however you want, but he urged the NFL to fire players who kneel and he can't do that as POTUS. Period.

Something the NFL lacks.
This has nothing to do with the NFL though you people reach way to hard 
I agree, players are using the NFL platform to express personal thoughts. Catapiller or IBM wouldn't condone doing this on company time.
@NFL 's Logic

Take a Knee to pray 4 GOD - not ok

Take a Knee to protest Country- ok 

Humm.. let that sink in...

RIP @NFL 

#TakeTheKnee
Except what you say is untrue. The NFL does not discourage taking a knee to pray to God. Not only a false equivalency, but a downright lie.
You need to stop this shit lol. They have every right to peacefully protest, no matter how much any of us may disagree with it.
The ACTUAL issues facing the NFL should be head injuries and how they change the neurology of the brain. Not knees.
With all due respect you are the one disrespecting our flag. Our flag stands for many great things and the right to protest is one of them
NFL PLAYERS USE TAXPAYER FUNDED STADIUMS (MY TAXES) FOR POLITICAL SPEECH WHICH IS ANATHEMA TO ME..VIOLATES MY RIGHTS

Looks like you fell for the “protesting the anthem” line. They aren’t. They aren’t protesting the flag either. Try reading up on it first.
U know how stupid that sounds, right? I mean seriously? Whether that's the intent or not, saying that's not what they're doing is ASININE.

Thank You smurfette! I love you too because you are a great American 

He’s just Smurfed off because he can’t get near one to grab it.
That's really how you feel? Then riddle me this, Donny:
Sadly that's a fake. Unlike this
His immigrant wife knows our customs better than he does! 
Sad but true.
But you thought burning it was respectful? #TakeAKnee #TakeTheKnee Just another shiny object to distract from illigitimate election. #Resist
Love it when his own tweets come back and bite him in the ass!

No one, especially you, you draft dodging asswipe, is going to dictate to me how I protest and in what manner I protest. Fu*k off.
Can we suspend you?
Let's Fire him!!
Only in the right context.
The fact that you think these players are doing it to disrespect the flag and not to support a cause would be mind blowing for a 7 year old
....and you're a president of a country
You are breaking the law
.2016 #Trump "bad for spirit #USA at the same time he has the right 2 protest & thats one of the beautiful things about the country" #resist
Right to protest, yes. So, why didn't he choose to call a press conference instead of showing disrespect to the entire nation?
.Regarding Why A Citizen Of #USA Didn't Call A Press Conference To Protest, Simple--It's Not Requirement Under The 1st Amendment #resist
not required, but certainly wouldn't generate as much hate for the protester if he didn't basically say he hates the nation
.No, He Along W/ Coaches Players & Conservative NFL Owners Are Exercising Their Constitutional Right #TrumpLies Shows He Hates #USA #Resist
resist what? A lawfully elected president?
.LOL The Lost #ForgottenOnes. Resist Hate Bogus Race & Nationality Wars An Unethical Serial Lying Kleptocratic Sociopathic @POTUS Criminal
you are so lost aren't you? Bless your heart
USA is standing up against having a white supremacist in the WH #TakeAKnee You don't have a clue how to get your ratings out of the 30's
#ImpeachTrump
You're the one that needs to be fired! #ImpeachTrump .@realDonaldTrump #trump #batman https://www.dreamysupply.com/product-page/dreamysupply-you-re-impeached-donald-trump-men-s-white-t-shirt …
You bum just like @KingJames said 
Also quit buying from the companies that sponsor the NFL . Stand up for the  #POTUS #MAGA
fyi this tweet is a felony, Hoss.
lol i've given up hope that anyone is actually holding him accountable for anything
Absolutely hate talking about politics on here, especially when I know a lot of people disagree, but seriously....
You gwoofy Donald
Brilliant strategy. Attack 1st Amendment & thus inspire global coverage of defiance against you. Your weakness shown in stark relief. 
Dude is so clueless.
It’s almost as if he does ridiculous things in order to distract us from some impeachable crime or something.
As a middle aged white, Southern woman and mother, I would gladly drop to one knee in support of African Americans.
Mannnnnnnnnnnnnnn...SHUT UP!
A statement from President Obama 1 year ago. It is how a real president responds unfortunately we haven’t had one in America since 1/20/2017
#Real President= @realDonaldTrump
#FakePOTUS = @realDonaldTrump
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
This isn't about the flag you asshole. It's patriotic to protest in peace. Something you know nothing about. Read: http://constitutionus.com 
#NFLBurnNotice Screw the @NFL! You want to protest? Carry a sign and march around your gated mansions while real heroes protect freedom.
Boom  Baby  Bam 

#NFL rule re: national anthem is found on pages A62-63 of NFL Rulebook and
U.S. Code › Title 36 › Subtitle I › Part A › Chapter 3 › § 301

That ... doesn’t prove anything, Jerry. Screenshotting a fake story doesn’t make it true.
It's true. They fail to note the "should stand" part. The NFL knows it can't enforce, SCotUS ruled ages ago against compulsory routines.
Yes. That’s why the rule only allows punishment if players aren’t on the field when the anthem starts.
We want to fire you for being the divider in chief & an embarrassment to this country
Good to see most players at Wembley #TakeTheKnee
Awesome
You pal around with Nazis and question anyone else's patriotism, you hypocritical sack of rhino shit? Fuck you and all of you minions.
I love you and I hope someday we can both be blocked by the McDonald together.
Blocked Buddies! It's a sitcom pitch. Two wacky roommates send horrible messages to the president and then the Secret Service kills them.
I like it. I'll write the pilot and you can edit/add swear words so it can only be aired on HBO or Showtime!
2/2 So we follow him to his gold-plated apartment and do a Topper thing, only it's more like Poltergeist and THEN he kills himself.
2/2  (Spoilers! She's only a 9 and he doesn't go for it.)
It practically writes itself!
They flew Nazi & Confederate flags in #Charlottesville -- where was your outrage then?
Everything that he has and he is is because of white supremacy.

Trumps is the one with the automatic responses; blame Hillary, blame Obama, bring up NFL...etc..repeat
I disagree with all that but my tweet was a response to the racist filth you guys are always spewing. Try to keep up.
No it's you who needs to keep up with the fact that Trump is sub human & has done nothing to help anyone with the exception of himself.
That totally absurd. Trump is about as racist as your mama. Liberals spewing false slanderous filth are sub human.

Where do I go to buy my season tickets?
If you're rooting for San Francisco, you go to Santa Clara. If you're rooting for Oakland, you go to Las Vegas.
I’m rooting for free speech!
Do that on your own time!
This is our own time.
Sorry no REAL #American is interested in your kind of change @realDonaldTrump just like the USFL! #tictoc #fuhrer https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9fEM-MfSiU …
But the @nfl was okay with this..
Non-sequitur argument. Please try again.
The entire world is ashamed of you. Please flush and go play some golf.
Players are exercising their rights, you are breaking the law
I implore the #NFLplayers that refuse to #TakeTheKnee to start speaking out AGAINST the defiance of their teammates. 

 #AmericaFirst!
No argument from me although I would also implore parents to teach their children respect of authority as well.
Then I request that authority figures treat those under their authority with the same respect. You respect me, I respect you, no problems.
Powerful Vid - 15 yr old  says @POTUS going after @NFL players for disrespect not being black  RT #ResignGoodell
Well said Young  man  very well said indeed .   God bless you and your country .
And my Veteran Husband respects them enough to support their protest.#sacraficeforthewin
He had better ways to protest than showing disrespect to the entire nation. Any news station would have held a conference with him.
Still you all MISS the point! It’s HIS Right! Be mad pout type tweets! Won’t change it! It in the constitution!!!
It's also a US Code that everyone is supposed to stand for the anthem...
 Show it

Sir, #nationalism is NOT #patriotism.

Patriots defend the 1st Amendment, they do not attempt to suppress it.
Citizens must not be compelled to stand for the flag/anthem, by their employer or another citizen. Period. Full stop.
The moment that happens, patriotism & democracy die; replaced by nationalism & tyranny.

That may be what you want, but that is not America.

No freedom from cconsequences. No stand, no watch NFL = no Advertisers.
@dansumner - Your choice.

You are not an employee of the @NFL. You are customer.

Want your boss to tell you CANNOT stand for anthem?
Dude. We're the Boss of the @NFL. We pay them. If our employees want to flip us off to our faces, go get another job!
No one flipped you off. No @NFL player insulted you with words or gestures. 

They quietly took a knee to bring attention to injustice.
the NFL is committing suicide allowing the players to disrespect millions of Americans.
Wrong
This is you when @FLOTUS cheers you up if one of your goals fails
All of his goals are coming to success.. go back to fantasy land please.. baaaah baaaah
Well mr.president if you would stop having the police kill unarmed black young men (and boys) they wouldn’t have to try to get America’s attention.
Please pay attention. They are not disrespecting flag or country. They're protesting (among other things) systemic racism. You know, racism? Like what YOU support?

Yo dudo que él vaya a despedir NFL personas
Dudo Que Nosotros Pararemos Defender Nuestro País. Llámalo Que Como Quieres.
Yo recomiendo que los fanáticos apoyen a los jugadores de la NFL en lugar de estar en contra de los jugadores
No estoy de acuerdo porqué el NFL jugador está protestando brutalidad de Policía
tell me you have something more important to worry about. They're exercising #1stAm I don't agree with display but just be quiet for once
@MikeStehn ..exercising the “power of our purse”. If we do not watch, their advertisers leave. the Flag represents all of us and our dead relative soldiers! NFL are idiots if they think this behavior will gain them fans. First Amendment or not. 
POTUS WRONG AGAIN! NFL players respect National anthem. & Protest during anthem against some Racist Police shooting unarmed children of color. #Stopshootingchildern Stop shooting our Black brothers n sisters. #IdiotTrump
#ww I .     As#As we. #xez. ---
En mi opinion Donald trump es muy stupido y deberia cierra boca.
Hey, dotard - how was your Super Bowl party last night? Did you enjoy watching all the "disrespectful" players much?
sup bro ypu suck
So many stand with you on this Mr President,
Wrong. Don't bother to understand why they are protesting during the anthem.  Not protesting the anthem.  Typical.
What if it was white kids being killed? I know-TAKE ACTION RIGHT AWAY!!
WE THE PEOPLE need to fire you for violating our Constitutional laws!!!!
Tiny base tiny miss.
well it is disgusting just stretching walking around taking a knee.by doing that  you are shitting on your country.
The confederate flag is disrespectful to the United States flag
idk about that
Dude,  hayes is as redneck and racist as it gets
So they say , mark henry has said he isnt at all . Hating on southern people seems pretty racist
Whos hating on southern ppl
Well im no expert but isnt that where rednecks come from and where the flag is mostly used ?
MR. PRESIDENT.     I.  AGREE. WITH.   YOU.  100%
If we stop tweeting, will you stop ?
Fuck the flag & anthem. I never knew the words.
Looked like someone close to 80,000 people in Wisconsin didn’t mind going to the Packer game yesterday.
https://twitter.com/KJGould/status/912509551924187136 …
Please stop talking
Is this the Trump who respects the flag so much that he ignores The Code "never used for advertising purposes" or "used as wearing apparel"?
Tu es mauvais
NFL pregame show had highest viewership in 7 YEARS. Tired of winning yet?
He probably has a financial in the NFL, lol.
You more worried about the NFL , do some fucking work get In a plane and fly to PR
Go ahead and do that to the NFL and enjoy the backlash
Totally Agree!
Or even watch them.
Our flag is disrespected daily but you can't fire everyone. You need to work with people if you want them to work with you.
Your country isn't a flag or a song. Your country's an eclectic mix of citizens. Make them proud of their govt & your wishes will come true
Agreed!!  No place for this on the field!  Do your protest on you own time!

The people that need to be fired are YOU and the rest of your unethical Administration
Maybe they don't feel the flag or national anthem represents them so y should they represent either of them?It's a choice in a free land?
.
Amen our president there's more to this though than meets the eye as one will say
Fire 
Inauguration day. Remember the oath you took? To defend the constitution? You swore on the bible. Remember? You just broke it.
Sad sad, and some "libertarians" support you, I wouldn't disrespect the flag but they have the LIBERTY to do so
45=domestic terrorist.45 make Americans attack ea other. He creates an escalation of anger/hate with EVERY tweet, interview and gathering.
LOL No ones getting fired.  No one is getting  suspended.  Stay out of Football!!  Puerto Rico needs our help and you are denying them.
They are athletes, but you refer to them as "owned" men! Your tweets/demands echo slave owners, those "sons of bitches". If you "owned" them
You are a lunatic
Thank you sir. Trump fixed the national anthem ceremony. Now they kneel before the singing. He won't get credit for that though. Keep it up
And if they refuse to stop this nonsence Lets all be done and watch them all go broke. No respect for our country or OUR PRESIDENT Trump

We got it! Now go and save our country!  
No you wouldn't, and telling any private employer to fire or suspend an employee is disgusting.  Wait till your family is.
Do you not see (does no one see) how your remark is just a few short steps from "You will kneel before the king or you will lose your head"?
We are within our rights! Just like the wanna be Storm Troopers in Wilmington did! Your hypocrisy is glaring! Have you no shame?
You definitely know how to get your Redneck Crew fired up! Even if it's BS you speak! IT IS NOT ABOUT THE FLAG OR ANTHEM!
And you will have no game to watch!  Talent is why those men are playing! Too many young Black millionaires for you???
Draft dodger
Thank you President Trump! Exactly right
THANKS!  Mr. President, for taking on the National Felony league!!!!!
Ha. You’re stupid if you believe people are going to stop watching NFL games for more than a few weeks. They’ll forget.
Why don't you worry about being the president and take care of your own house
Have we forgotten men like this?
Stop changing the narrative and address the real issue
We tried that with your inauguration
Are you aware that you care more about what football players are doing than what Puerto Rico is doing?
Dude!!! Go to work!!!! Damn! You spend more time on Twitter than most high school girls
I'm not watching or attending NFL. #KnowledgeIsPower!#AwesomeTeam
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU KEEP CLAPPING AND YOUR MOUTH IS ROUND FROM SUCKING WHATEVER, BANANAS AREN'T ADDICTIVE, ONLY DICKS
Please go to do your job and stop with this bully crap.
Did...did you just call for people in a private organisation to be fired for doing something legal that you disapprove of?
I’m pretty sure the president spent more time thinking about the #NFL this weekend than the average fantasy player. #comeon
Aren't there more important issues you could focus on? Healthcare? Hurricane victims?   You're the President! Act like it! #Priorities
GodBless #Potus #Trump!
Fuk #Obama #HRC #DACA #CNN #MSNBC #MorningJoe #NFL!

#MAGA #FoxNews #GOP #ESPN #MTV #GMA #NBA #PGA #NRA #TheView #WH
Puerto Rico you fool! Stop this nonsense & focus on the needs of the people... #PuertoRico
How did you figure out how to get the NFL to bow to you on bended knee like servants to a king?
YOU think what you're saying will deflect from your healthcare bid, but it won't.
I totally agree!!! @realDonaldTrump 
Are you trying to buy an NFL team? Why are you trying to make football lose money?
They don't even fire players who have multiple criminal felonies as per their policy
really?that's pretty shitty.
Violating 18 U.S. Code § 227
#BoycottNFL BREAKING NEWS: Commissioner Goodell says the NFL voted to rename the Pittsburgh Steelers. They are now the Pittsburgh Kneelers.
The owners were out there doing it too, including Jerry Johnson! #fakeoutrage #fakepresident
You should be fired
You live in a fucked up country if you believe that standing for your national anthem is what is most important.
NFL are bitches of Obama and the left invested in race problems as cause like the way use global warming for globalism and socialism
No, I am white and I call you a bully!  Also unamerican draft dodger, but able to play football??  Did you respect our flag or country?
If Pittsburgh wants to play as the Kneelers, they should do so with an appropriate logo - Same goes for the other teams as well.
You need to be impeached! Your the worst president on the planet! Why are u not down there helping ppl in PR your racist af!
Pull the federal funding. Put an end to this crap once and for all!
Quick pass an unconstitutional law then talk about respecting authority!  Indictments are coming!
And they say it's not political right? MAGA
So where's this fast change you promised??  They all disrespected you, I mean your flag.  Whatcha gonna do?
Perhaps the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and NASCAR should refuse to play and race in protest of a racist Presidency.
Most of us have no respect for you.  When are you going to leave?
Amen. Fire everyone of them
justice for all, where is the justice for BLACK MEN? I say to the black athlete get off your knees wise up and rise up, stop reacting.
Your approval rating is lower.
I believe the Citizens of this great country should stop subsidies to the NFL with our HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS. A DISGRACE
