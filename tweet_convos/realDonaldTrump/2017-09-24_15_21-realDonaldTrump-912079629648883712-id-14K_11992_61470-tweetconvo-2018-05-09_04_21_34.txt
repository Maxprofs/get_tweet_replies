BORED!
You have no idea what you’re talking about.
While you were golfing today there’s still millions of US Puerto Rican citizens under water & without power. Maybe you should get on that?
Because it is a cruel bill fix ACA
You are President of all states and people.
You promised to replace ACA with something better but your damn fool Republicans can't come up with something better. No to GOP Deathcare.
Shut up!
YOURE KILLING US
Vote out those who oppose Trump let's get his policies and programs in play
Day#246 of the hostage situation. Captor continues to harass wayward supposed Acolytes. Hostages not impressed, growing stronger, end near!

Are you the president of all states? I want all Americans even those who voted for you and need mental health counseling to have health care
All against the Graham Cassidy bill!
Wow, ha ha NO Trump Care. #loser
#FAKEPRESIDENT #IMPEACHTHEDOTARD
Once again you don't know anything about it.....
Does this make the other 46 states the big losers? You don’t know since you haven’t read the new plan. As long as ACA is gone right?  SHAME!

Huh? Footballs on. The Do Not Disturb sign is on. Ssshhh.
Lying again Donnie. You're a racist. P.S. #RUSSIA ! #TakeAKnee
Trump is the LEAST TRUSTFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD.  PUTIN IS PROBABLY MORE HONEST THAN TRUMP.  Graham/Cassidy bill is TERRIBLE
GOP will lose donations from Mercer & Koch Bros (supposedly) if Ocare doesn't get repealed so the 1% can get their tax rate cut & tax breaks
Give us some details Donnie. Do you know any? We'll wait.
Never happen. Trump loses again/
Obama care is good. We know you want to destroy everything he did. Well guess what donald Obama was a president..you're not

All those states lose federal funding under Graham-Cassidy, Don. It's as if you have no clue what you're talking about.
Do you know the concept of zero-sum strategy? Silly me, of course you don’t. There are MORE big losers than BIGLY winners
Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal & Replace and some Senators not there.
You are SO out of touch.
Try reading it
some people don't like being forced to buy insurance so that they don't have to pay a huge fine
And 32 MILLION Americans will lose. #Resign #ImpeachTrump #impeachTrumpnow
Do you have any idea what the "deals" are that you think make them winners??
Repeal the disaster known as Obamacare. Hurry up Congress!!!
Doctor: #GrahamCassidy health 'reform' is a wolf in sheep's clothing
The Greatest President Ever

Hyperbolic and inane the first time, second time proves you're either a bot or just stupid.
In real news #PuertoRico

Kinda alt lefty nonsense. Poor idiots. Sad
Sad that you support such a poor leader. Get help.
Poor? Let’s see. Multi billionaire, DOW all time high, 1 million+ jobs, deregulation, lowest unemployment rate in 16 yrs, lowest food stamps
You obviously only see it by a numbers standpoint. Trump isn't capable of leading a country. He's a celebrity and supports white supremacy.
Cause you suck and everything you propose sucks!  You are the worst president in modern history ... and will always go down as such.
Some senators are not there because your replacement is cruel to 30mm+. Including me and several of my older friends. Got no votes from us.
That's great, but what about the FBI awarding the contract to equafax for security, and what happened to I'm going to drain the swamp!
Big military and no help for CHIP! Do you know what this is?
I’m thinking of moving to Alaska for a wile to see if it’s what I think
I'm sure that what you know about healthcare could fill a thimble....
Do you know what the truth is?
Get me my fucking help
7 years of repeal and replace.. Isn't that considered insanity?
I am so ashamed to have such a disgraceful, shameful, sexual predator, money grubbing old man.   Another evil white guy like the LV guy!
Mr. President, when are they going to keep their promise. I can't afford my copays let alone my deductible. :-(
#WorstPresidentEver
Winners? You think health care is a game????
@realDonaldTrump  and Millions of American Middle Class and the Poor will be the Real Losers in you Fake Healthcare!
It's not a lottery, you discolored buzzard. It's people. It's made out of people. Like Soylent Green.
When you have something real, there maybe it will get somewhere...
And it most decidedly is not a casino. It would show a profit, otherwise. Unless of course you ran it.

All Americans are big winners now that trumpcare has been defeated.  Trump - Loser
Knowbody is a winner with this shit you call health care you moron #not my president
You lose again, Dotard.  Heroes like Sen. McCain, Sen Collins and Sen Murkowski will never agree to hurt people. CBO scores new bill Shitty.
Oops.
How will Puerto Rico fare?

Oops, did you forget about them?
Just fix ACA. Stop trying to kill Americans by taking away health care.
If every state is not a winner, than the legislation is a loser.
well, I live in OHIO....why aren't we big winners too?
#StillAGarbageProposal #MakeHealthInsuranceGreatForAmericansAgain #TakeCareOfThePeopleYouServeNotYourDonors
The other 46 don't count? Bye Don.
There are not supposed to be winning states and losing states in healthcare, every state should win.  Winning is everything!
They are winners? We are losers? Jesus Christ we are so sick of your sadistic manipulative bullshit!! Jesus Christ your killing my son u !!!
So not America  - just 4 states.
Trying to buy senators?
America is the loser though...
Bribing people now?  20-32 million will go w/o coverage for Pre Ex idiot
Translate?  These Senators wont vote for your crappy healthcare bill so these states win.
Government healthcare is a loser...and you know that.
Yep, those idiots in Alaska have no idea they are going 2 get the shittiest healthcare ever with Trump! Their fault Alaska so far from D.C.!
Four states out of fifty are winners. Doesn't sound like a well thought out plan. Back to the drawing board
Under #GrahamCassidy:
41K lose coverage in AK
511K lose coverage in AZ
161K lose coverage in ME
386K lose coverage in KY

This is 'winning'?
right, promise NOT to repeal Obama care for them so you can hurt the rest of the country. DO NOT REPEAL THE ACA!!
Because they're being bribed by being allowed to keep ACA you Dotard.
Long enough for a to fly to the planet of Jupiter which is only 365 million miles away
@realDonaldTrump  Alaska doesnt want your money. We want a quality, affordable healthcare plan that respects all. Your $$ is no good here!!
#whenareyougoingtojail ?

Not how it works. Fail.

Alaska gets to keep Obamacare if she votes for it and everyone else doesn’t ? Sounds like a bribe to me .
#TrumpCareKills #BadBill #MeanBill #SaveACA #Loser still looking for a win? #NotGonnaHappen you're #UnAmerican #TooStupid #NoHeartNoBrain
you are nothing more than con man and traitor to americans, maybe me we can banish you to Russia
So you're trying to take health care away from the people wow... congrats
The senators that have problems with the proposal get to be the big winners damning the other 46 states in this sickening plan.
and the losers in this bill?  The American people
Bribery  at the hands of our so-called leaders. SAD!!!
Yeah, they are the states that are getting to keep Obamacare! If @lisamurkowski votes yes for this just because she got paid off, she's...
Oh....so we are trying to buy those three votes! Let's talk about what this bill does to NY, NJ and CA.
The senate is basically offering those that are against the healthcare bill with billions of dollars. The art of the bribe?
Screw New Hampshire and it's Leftist Sinator!
Once again, the Trump administration thinks it is perfectly fine to DRAG people out of their wheelchairs - during ONLY #Trumpcare meeting.
So you adjust it so a few states get preferential treatment to obtain votes? Not democratically correct.
According to you, you are president & you're not all there.  You'll also never be my president.
4 states?  Out of 50?  Why are those 4 big winners, but not anyone else?  Political games maybe?  Your whole administration & party suck ass
Blue states = loser states - coincidence? You truly believe that you can do anything and not suffer consequences - but wrong you are
What about all the other states?
#Trumpcare2.0 KILLS and you will OWN IT! Shameful #CassidyGraham
You made HUGE promises to people that you would LOWER costs & cover everyone! What a lie! This Death Bill would cut off 32,000,000 people!
Sorry,  oh puny-handed-one, the GOP attempt at buying the votes of the few senators it needed FAILED. #TINYHANDS #TINIERMIND

Nice try orangutan
I  live in NJ
President Trump ran stating he would not cut funding to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.  GrahamCassidy cuts Medicaid by BILLIONS.
So does it help these states at the expense of other states?  Why aren't all 50 states (and territories) "big winners"?
This is a complete Lie. SCARY that you can't do math.
Why did you exclude them if they would vote for it?
I am begging you- READ THIS BILL. You are not accurately representing the horrors within this proposal.
How's that now? Care to elaborate? You've undoubtedly read the bill, so please cite specifically where this claim is substantiated. Thanks.
#WhatAboutPuertoRico?
Sweeten the pot.  Bribery.  All for a win.  My healthcare is just as important.  Kill the bill
Sounds like political bribery. Truth?
I WILL NEVER vote for Rand Paul or Ted Cruz for president EVER!  Dirty, rotten politicians that are swamp-dwellers.
We need a basic healthcare plan for everyone,even the elite!Covering basics! Costing based on age groups!supplement policy can be purchased!
Here's the thing...certain states shouldn't be "winners."  Every state should have access to equal, affordable and quality health care.
Bribing certain states? How did the other states react?
Liar
16 states are net funding "winners" under #GrahamCasiddy. 

BUT...AK AZ ME KY are all net losers. 

#FactsFirst
Once again, you are a liar.
He just made this up out of whole cloth. Unreal.

16 states are net funding "winners" under #GrahamCasiddy. AK AZ ME KY are all net losers. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912079629648883712 …
https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/us-defense-department-paid-14-nfl-teams-54m-to-honor-soldiers/ …  You SUCK
We have 50 states and more territories. You represent them all and it's horrific for u 2 cherry pick a few states to try to screw the others
You're just trying to bribe votes for a travesty that will hurt & kill Americans.  You are a White Supremacist traitor to America.
Shouldn't all Americans be winners in this? And not just the ones you cherry pick to try to get votes?
Because you're basically letting them keep Obamacare. Undercutting the argument that Trumpcare is better. Idiot.
Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal & Replace and some Senators not there.
#Dotard  #Fakepresident
You do know there are 46 more states, right? And are the citizens of those states all losers in this proposal?
Unfortunately it's not a true repeal. A beginning
Lord Chancellor, did I deliver the speech well? I am glad of that, for there was nothing in it.
-King George lll
Isn't that called redistribution?
Trying to bribe the senators from those states to pass this is un american
Once again, you do not know what you are talking about.
.@realDonaldTrump Hey pea-brain. Imagine a bill where all 50 states are big winners in healthcare. Alaska is in solidarity with all states
No, they have less cuts to buy votes. But the whole country would lose it #TrumpCare passes.
You do realize that's 4 out of 50 states....
Please resign
RINOs sentencing millions to suffer with deductibles too high for them to seek care.
Executive order. Take the teeth out of Ocare, protect small businesses and let is collapse.
For the illiterate,#MAGA means "Morons Are Governing America"!
Collectively, over 1 million people in these 4 states will lose coverage in this proposal.  Big winners? Proponents of tax cuts.
Unconstitutional by the way
Vietnam draft dodging coward and loser you supported  obamacare  and your two liberal friends Reid & Pelosi.
The American people should be the winners - not states, not politicians, not you. This is this not a game. It's about people's lives.
Nobody is a winner with the new deathcare proposal.

Are you giving better health coverage or keeping ACA in those states to bribe their Senators? Really? More uninsureds ok with you?
What you are trying to push through is a joke. Where is the fire? Do something the right way for a change. #NoRepeal
Some senators are not there because the repeal and replace is not all there.
Congratulations!
这么可怕的么？
Traitors

What about all those who will sicken and DIE as a result of this inhuman proposal?
I lost my Dr. I can't afford to get sick and go in the hospital. I'm done. Sign a executive order if you have to BUT REPEAL, PLEASE REPEAL
Some senators are smarter than you, and that's not saying much. #trumpisanidiot #TinyHands
Where is @SenJohnMcCain plan for obamacare/is he simply happy blocking all suggestions? Rand Paul has a plan! Where is McCain's?
AZ will be one of the biggest losers with the new plan. We will lose millions of dollars and those with preexisting conditions, no coverage.
I really don’t like Trump
Taking $160,000,000,000 OUT of health care will NOT make America great again.
It's time you led ALL Americans, not just your KKK base.
Bribery could get you somewhere.
And what about the rest of us?
Will you and congress be on the same health care as the rest of us?
Let's repeal and replace you...that's how to make America great again
