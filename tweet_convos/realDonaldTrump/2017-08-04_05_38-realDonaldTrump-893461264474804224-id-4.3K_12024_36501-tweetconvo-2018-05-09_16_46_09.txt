Republican Senators who are opposing the President, look at the great economic news: Americans Are Noticing!

Who will be out of a job first? 
@seanhannity 
@POTUS
Come on America. Get on the Trump Train. The winners already have boarded! The losers are welcome. We changed a Governor, why not you!

They seem to be looking in at you.
They are looking at the other Trump
Beauty is a pleasure that God has aloud use to see! Thank
him for not making HATE as visible.

As a candidate Your lord said the jobs numbers were phony
#ThanksObama
3rd day &Trump's Gallup approval is at 36%.
The last time he hit 40% or above was July 11

Strange, the #JobsReport was fake the last few years, but now it's legit...
Thanks Obama!
And how exactly is it that you deserve *any* credit for this data? Policies? Legislation? Anything substantiating?! Uh yea, thought not.
The Dow hits a record high while Dems cling to Russia
Thats GREAT NEWS BUT NOBAMA& the libertards reworked how the figures read& unemployment is not truly what it represents in the numbers seen
FAKE
Thanks Obama thanks..
WATCH LIVE AT 2:30 PM PACIFIC!!
THANK YOU, Donald Trump POTUS 45!!!
Job creation monthly average
Obama's last year in office: +189,000 / month
Trump's first 6 months: +179,000 / month https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth …
Wages remain stagnant, however.
@BarackObama inherited 9.3% unemployment rate (historical high). trump inherited 4.9% (lowest since 1948).  Thank you @BarackObama
Nice

http://www.gq.com/story/trump-17-day-vacation/amp …
Useless Senators are on vacation, and our @POTUS is working hard for us

209k jobs added in July Unemployment rate down 4.3%

#JobsReport
Obama created 255k jobs last July. I'm sure you were cheering Obama last July, right?
nah they were too busy being pissed off about the kind of mustard he used...
Not really, his mustard had nothing to do with the deficit which he created by NOT knowing how to govern princess.
Condescending much? O handed trump a thriving economy which he is sending into a tailspin by being a brat Sunshine...see--what fun ,eh?
Obama handed him nothing, a stalled head above the water economy is all he was capable of. Massive failure
So why were more jobs created last July?
Thank you President Obama for giving us such a great economy.  Let's hope "President" Trump doesn't screw it all up.
Thanks Obama!!!
THANKYOU PRESIDENT OBAMA

Thank you Obama! #ObamaDay
Win Win Win!!! Trumps words are showing

i forgot for a moment that the job report is no longer fake news since trump was put in office by russia, silly me.
The Job #'s are up, ONLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE ATTORNEY's MUELLER HAS HIRED!

And none of this had anything to do with the FAILING @realDonaldTrump.
This will not save you from impeachment.
So Trump was lying when he said the unemployment rate was 42% just a year ago?
Yeah most of us Americans know he and entire admin are LIARS!
#ObamaDay

 The great President @BarackObama handed Trump an economy that was close to what economists consider full employment 
I wonder if anyone is smart enough to see that Obama is not in the driver's seat on this one? So if it's not Obama then who is it?!
SPOILER ALERT: It's Obama.
the obama ec onomy is humming!!!!!!!! give a black man some credit
The same jobs report you touted as #FakeNews when @POTUS44 was in office is real now? Hmmmmm
#MAGA
Just a slogan on a cheap hat MADE IN CHINA. You know he's going to jail, right?
Maybe a low follower troll has breaking proof! Share with everyone - let's see what you are made of

Thanks @BarackObama !
For what? Doubling the national debt? Obama increased the it by $918 Billion in first 6 months, whereas Trump lowered it by $103 Billion

The Daily Wire has also published false information such as this and this from Ben Shapiro. (9/2/2016) Updated (5/30/2017)
prove it
u left this out Shapiro 
Obama Feb.2016-July 2016: 
1,246,000 jobs added

Trump Feb.2017-July 2017:
1,074,000 jobs added
Your missing the "jobs lost" piece of the pie pumpkin .
nah it's jobs added, same figures he is trumpeting tulip. my comparison is valid. I don't see trump saying anything about jobs lost peaches
Mueller has grand jury going after Trump & Republican Senators support Mueller.  Trump is done.
You are probably correct. Thing is, you overlook why? It's because he is dismantling what they have been building for 100+ years via EO.
Why? Because Trump is a well-known con artist, perv & idiot.  He is amoral & dangerously unfit.  Most in DC are on the verge of dialing 911
Classy! That's the equivalent to me saying Obama sucked because he was a black. But really he and Bush Sucked equally cuz they hate America.
You think black = amoral batshit crazy amoral con artist that is being babysat by a General cause DC knows.   C U L T.  Tell Squeaky hi!
Shouldn't you be out a ledge somewhere?
Dan ... I can't help you. Trump has you by the pussy.   Regards
Sorry but I believe that would be the equivalent to handing the keys to a drunk and asking them to drive me home...

Well, geez.  I thought these were Fake Numbers back when Obama was president.  Isnt that kind of hypocritical?
Thank you @BarackObama !!!!
And actually it's down from last year. Trump is still benefiting from Obama's work. Trumps done NOTHING! Wait until his work = recession!
Thanks @BarackObama !!
A feather in cap

Thanks Obama!!
@IvankaTrump No shit, Sherlock.   Pretty good trend over the last 8 years.   What a tremendous 6-month accomplishment??
@realDonaldTrump
Hey @realdonaldtrump? According to YOUR Labor Dept:

Obama Feb/16-July/16
1,246,000 jobs added…
Repeating Labor Dept stats for this nitwit:

Obama Feb.2016-July 2016
1,246,000 jobs added

Trump Feb.2017-July 2017
1,074,000 jobs added

Repeating Labor Dept stats for this nitwit:

Obama Feb.2016-July 2016: 
1,246,000 jobs added…
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump will finally send unemployment out of USA, and now we all can see dat America is moving forward.
#PIMPOTUS

#treasonweasel
Obama FTW. Eat it, Trump. You're obviously going to spite-crash Obama's massive recovery the way you're spite-crashing healthcare.
All thanks to Obama and his skills at fixing the economy. 
None of this is due to Trump.
But Donald said the unemployment rate was a lie so now it isn't? He said he "heard" "it was 46%! Funny how things change. #TrumpsTwoFaces

what?All those farm work jobs aren't being filled by unemployed white boys from MI?  U know, those screaming immigrants r taking away jobs.
@realDonaldTrump #BREAKINGNEWS 54% of Americans are EMBARRASSED to have Trump as @POTUS #maga #resist
Great work! 
Kremlin Barbie, grab your traitorous husband and go away!! Ho W about to Russia?
Thank Obama

Sorry, but that is due to Obama and not to DT.  His results won't come out until October or so.  Didn't you know that?
average monthly job growth in 9 months since Trump's election: 179K

average monthly job growth in 9 months before Trump's election: 199K

Ya tell that to the LEFT.
I Urge EVERYONE
JOIN YOUR LOCAL @GOP 
MAKE A CHANGE FROM WITHIN! 
LOW TURNOUT IS OUR WORSE ENEMY!
This is a REMINDER.. We Can Talk About Suing the @GOP & Bitch About them...
BUT you have to JOIN them to MAKE A CHANGE
@GOP meeting tonight 
Thank you, Obama! <3
THANKS Obama!!
Just thanked a supporter that has the same stock photo of atleast 20 accounts  Young black woman he can't even tell  ....Bots
So happy to hear that companies are prospering under our current tax code. Please don't change anything!!!
I like the report but I am still unemployed nearing 1 year.
So you didn't believe the jobs numbers under obama... but now you do?
Thanks Obama!
Thanks Obama
Greenback target 1.17 short time....1.12.year end. Ok
Could have been 4 times that w/repeal of crapcare, fewer lower wage green card holders , lower taxes & huge removal of bad regulations.
Yet your daughter, @IvankaTrump, stated on Dr. Oz show that there are 6,000,000 people UNEMPLOYED & she stated that it's Highest in History!
but has any1 noticed he ONLY talks EXCLUSIVELY 2??? (August 4, 2017; 8:38 EDT) #DONALDTRUMP #FOXnewsus #FAIL
Besides our safety this is what the matters the most
Thanks Obama
Thank Obama for cutting Medicaid, no dental, no optical eye wear. Now I'm toothless and blind.
Sorry I keep retweeting this, but need to respond to your/Fox's repeated boasting about something not worth boasting about about, in context
THANKS OBAMA!
Obama gave us jobs yeah, LOW PAYING JOBS!!
@POTUS has given Companies less regulations SO able hire more employees. Thank you Mr. President
Alternate fact. Since you pretend to be journalists perhaps you should try getting facts like statistics. Numbers are hard but try.
Because of the programs that President Obama put in place, not the pig-in-chief.
Thanks to President Trump. WE THE PEOPLE elected him!

And @TheDemocrats all said
"....jobs...." (grabs dictionary)
The best part Mark Greene blamed bush for $14 trillion of Obama debt & says these jobs are due to Obama not Trump rolling back regulations
@seanhannity start talking about under employment! I used to make five times as much as I do now!


@POTUS Thank You for #MAGA
Kudos for Trump administration


THANK YOU OBAMA FOR SUCH GOOD WORK! TRUMP TRIES SO HARD FOR FAILURE!
Thanks Obama! #25thAmendmentNow #MuellerTime
Fake News.

Superb! That's success of Obamas workforce! #dumpTrump can now profit of that! Question is: How long will it take until he ruined it?
excellent!  keep up Obama's arc......
As we know this is due to budget passed last year under @BarackObama we will not be able 2 see @realDonaldTrump until his budget implemented
@realDonaldTrump really!someone please dispute this. Too good to be owned by Trump. Please main stream media do something.
What's wrong with people when they berate HOPE to have every person working in their country?
Yes we are noticing!

Thanks President Obama!!!
#ThanksObama
Also, while the 209k jobs were added, part-time jobs increased and full-time jobs DECREASED! How does that help middle America?!
Now we need apprenticeships!! To help people get the training to do those jobs well
Still, thank you Obama!
Summer time employment. The numbers will go back up by October. Nothing new except Trump wants the credit.
@realDonaldTrump approval rating stagnant despite economic confidence http://dailym.ai/2vBbRMJ  via @MailOnline
FOX come on...economics tells you this is from the Obama trickle. Why do you continue to kiss DTs ass? Are you really this ignorant?
Really at what wage.
Blessings
Let's go ahead and get this out there before the MSM starts using the real unemployment rate all of a sudden...

Thanks to Obama.
