Kasich For President 2020!!! At least he's honest!
Cheaters always have to try to change the rules. Problem is @GOP has zero leadership.
much heart felt thanks to the 3  who thought of us and not you
Translation: "lower the bar for me because I'm an imbecile that can't get anything done."
Revenge is the best part of #FailureFriday
Why do you always blame someone else for your colossal failures?

Not for long!
@officialnmp
You knew nothing about this bill or about health care. Democrat and Republican heroes saved us.
Just fix the damn thing!!
You're a mess!
Give an example. I want to know you are paying attention and studied.
Please resign and go back to your real estate kingdom. It's a better fit for you.
Thanks for giving us The Mooch! He's so much more entertaining than you.
Dear America, This is what happens when you elect a celebrity with no public service experience/morals to public office. We were great...
If they can get together on Russian sanctions, they should be able to for repeal/replace. Some behave like children and we are tired of it.
did you know that Obama got the votes to pass the affordable care act?  Guess he is a better deal maker than you!
Smh
Make congress  & all congressional staff have to buy Obamacare like the rest of American and that $hit will get repealed in 24 hours.
No one likes you @realDonaldTrump!!!
So much winning!
This is how government works! Read the constitution!
There you are! I was afraid we were going to miss our daily lunatic tweet storm. Hurry up with the rest. Breathless!
Senseless? You would feel differently if there was a Dem majority. The affordable care act was passed under the system you are failing in.
Mr. President I would stop all lobbyist coming to meet these senators and everyone else until they fix health care for everyone.pressure
keep going cos u sound like you don't know what you're talking about - it makes everyone laugh and it's the best medicine, go healthcare!
Exactly! You can be sure the Democrats will do the SAME, the first chance they get-so you might as well change it now! They will just delay!

What the heck? Do you even know what you are talking about.. You continually contradict yourself
Is @BarackObama living in your head today? It's so delicious. You will never be the man Obama is. Check out @Peggynoonannyc article.
Healthcare has to be passed! Don't give up! The future of this country is riding on americas confidence that we all can succeed & be healthy
The Senate's 60 vote rule exists to encourage a more deliberative, collaborative process than often seen in the House.
Hmm... did the rules change or are you that clueless?
And since you guys can't come up with anything positive for Americans, please vacate the WH and Congress.

 
Checks and balances are a genius idea designed to protect us from people like you. #AmericaAlreadyGreat #TrumpRussia #ProtectOurCare
You warned us you were a snake..
RETWEET if you think John McCain is a traitor to the conservatives he's supposed to represent.
#beyond No doubt, traitor to Republican Party &Suffering Americans forced to have Obama care!Revenge vote
Budgets don't need 60. That's why budget reconciliation used for health care. Still failed. Stop messing with stuff you don't understand.
Why does it take 12 min to write the middle tweet of a series, and over 24 min to complete it (if ever)?
Pres.Trump Thank u For Helping Mid Class Working Families. To Bad Congress Just Wants Our Tax Dollars. KILLING the AMERICAN DREAM, KEEP MAGA
I was on vacation last week ,,, did I miss anything?
Mr. President, please don’t think of this as losing.  Think of it as coming in second in a two-man race.  #FridayFeeling #KillTheBill
Hey, it looks like Trump got one right after all ... 
#SkinnyRepeal #KillTheBill
Looks like George knew what he was talking about ... 
#Trumpcare #TrumpRussia #FridayFeeling
And those two women also, who tried to kill it from the beginning.

You have absolutely no idea how any of this works.
Stop being a bully it doesn't work
Loser!  Its the 'little hands' that can not count to 51..... back to the drawing board ...this time, get some help from the Democrats!
So many tweets, so little sense.

I pray this isn't true Mr President. Thx for all you do sir.
Multiple Hill staffers confirm last night McCain was heard laughing w Dems and remarked, "Lets see Donald make america great again now"
Translation: "lower the bar for me because I'm an imbecile that can't get anything done."
OK, I get it. First, you pick a #, then you pick another #, times that by zero, & that equals ... what? Your IQ? I keep coming up with 9!
It's 60 for a reason, not your convenience!
Really POTUS?!, geez you really ARE disconnected. Talk to your advisors, they'll fill u in on how many votes it takes. Smh
One more person who deserves thanks today: @BarackObama, who had the political courage to fight for the Affordable Care Act at all costs.
Not how this works....
Welcome to Washinghton, where there are rules and procedures, you should learn them.
Mr. Trump you are too costly and too disruptive to serve as POTUS. Please resign immediately.
You can't even get 51, you orange hairflapped shitgibbon failure. SAD!
https://youtu.be/QlRrRFox4Mg 
Get Hillary all this stuff will get behind us so we could move on MAGA
The original Constitution...
Idea..Healthcare of the people for the people including politicians.If u believe all men R created equal pass healthcare for ALL AMERICANS !
President @realDonaldTrump this is what we want #AmericasDesk
None got even 51 so what's your point?  You are bad at math
Failure of the GOP to movr forward on improving disastrous Obama Care will deeply hurt millions of Americans & our country in so many ways!
Sore loser. #SinglePayer #ObamaCare #SAD #Impeach
Need to vote out those damn RINOs. The lying fools think we are going to fall for that line again. They are useless and we need conservative
Rt sounds like an excuse not to pass pass the frame work then admends to it u will never get 60 votes lame excuse @POTUS
You need to make congress have the same health insurance the rest of us have.  They will get busy very quickly to change it.
The GOP House or Senate haven't written a good bill that helps the citizens. It helps business &donors. Try bipartisan for once. Obama did.
It's because you can only consider one reconciliation bill per topic per year and now it's failed you would now need 60 votes.  You failed!
Aww that's a shame for your shitshow. Too bad so sad. You buttnugget.
not happening donny haha
The animal that represents democrats is a jack ass lol at least elephants have a good memory but you alone Donald saved the republican party
as many British you nominate so many arms against you.As many Greeks you neck out so less days you have!!!
60?! Good Lord guy, get with the program, you oversized gorilla!
The point is the Republicans have sold out new Republican faces in 2018
Or, here's a whacky thought... maybe the two parties could work on legislation together & allow the system to work the way it should.
No, you're right, that's a stupid idea. Everything works best when both sides treat each other as mortal enemies.
Trump is losing badly, it's fucking HILARIOUS to see him just suck at everything, no matter who he fires it doesn't matter bc he's the loser
You want the rich to get richer, and the poor get poorer. ACA will be around forever. Give it up. Stop bullying to get your way. Not working
Wish you could use your Executive Orders to fire McCain and the other bad apples. Overturn their Exemption from ObamaCare.
Did you read that in the "How the Senate Works" comic book?  They're called rules and even the Congress, Executive & Judicial have rules!!'
You can't demolish that our President Obama built with care, with a clean heart and soul! You on the other hand are a 1 man shitshow

EXODUS 7:17; THE ROD THAT IS IN MINE HAND UPON THE WATERS WHICH ARE IN THE RIVER, AND THEY SHALL BE TURNED TO BLOOD:
There is a reason for the Senate rules. It is called good governance. Bi-partisanship works best.#realdonaldtrump should try it sometime.
You didn't have 51, honey. Ask @BetsyDeVos to help you with the math, ok?
Did you forget to take your medicine again????
Good morning mr. President Congress needs to pass this bill and that's it too.
They have the best policy for themselves and we need to pay for it and that's not fair
Can we impeach with only 51?
Start tomorrow!
I'm impressed you know what numbers are! Two for you that you'll never get 51 and 60
no they don't
I don't think the advantages and disadvantages of any health care package is being adequately explained. All rhetoric so far.
I know men trash talk! Let's Clean up conversation as well as The Swamp! Let's take the high road, Sir! God bless America!
Trumpy! You're weak weak weak. So weak. Sad.
https://youtu.be/DBshNh0W8zk 
Americans suffer while McCain & democrats applauded & laughed about it
please resign
Holy crap did you ever take an English class?? Oh shit bro. "SAD!"
Yes, and that helped the GOP stop the Dems from overreaching in the past as well.  Some things SHOULD need 60 votes.
WHAT YOU CALL REALLY GOOD, THE MAJORITY CALLS REALLY HORRIBLE! CAN'T CHANGE THE RULES TO FIT YOUR AGENDA!
You're so clueless.
Remember November 2020, we will start fixing everything you destroy & see you in prison for your traitorous acts.
The Deplorables will get you 60 in 2018, @POTUS! Thank you for doing such a wonderful job of #MAGA so far, and here's to the next 7.5 years!
Sir, 60 votes comes by reaching across the aisle w/ bipartisan policy ideas that help more people than they hurt!  Its simple really.
Please make healthcare affordable again.  I can't afford my daily medicine. As if this month the pharmacy isn't giving cash prices anymore 
You're a babbling, incoherent man-child. Just saying
nothing Trump has ever done has been great with the exception of conning the master race!

Make up your mind.
Thanks Sir for trying to get rid of HealthCare for 23 mil Americans! We deploreables don't need it! We have our faith, guns, and YOU! #Xmas!
Please don't change Medicare or Medicaid. It saved my life when I had cancer. My surgeon would not operate one me withou
Beer is really good, but when can get it for less calories, Bud Select has 55.

American doesn't deserve you. America deserves SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You couldn't even get 51. God, you suck as a dealmaker! Complete fraud!
Did you think a Nam war hero was going to back up a Nam Draft Dodger & COWARD
He Kicked you fair up the ASS
Bigly sagging Orange ASS
Repeal Obamacare & forget the rest.
Stop interrupting my hatred of you
Leave Jeff sessions alone!
GO #MYPRESIDENT!!!
#MAGA
来中国给你当乡长
Shouldn’t you be able to do more with full Republican control…you blamed Obama for that too

what happened to all of the winning we would get sick of?
The Left & RINO's are doing NOTHING for American people & focused on Obstructing our President. This must change, or Govt will NEVER recover
ว้าวว
See good boy - you get it now! Give Donnie a cookie!
Somebody needs to get the Republicans all on same page, what's gonna happen when workers start quitting and joining others
What's really good for ALL OUR PEOPLE will get the votes it needs. Extreme partisan agendas deserve to go down. You should RESIGN!!!!
If Congress were held to same healthcare plans as public, they would finally have incentive to change.  When will they put America first?
WAAAAHH... I can't get what I want... WAAAAHH... Change the rules... WAAAAHH

Yes, many things DO require 60 votes.  The Senate is designed to be the House of bipartisan sober judgment.  It has worked for 200 yrs
Ironic he's okay with becoming Pres w/out the majority of the votes, but upset that he can't pass a bill with the majority of the votes.
If the were so "great", you wouldn't have any problem getting 60. Screwing over the people of America #1 priority  #TrumpRussia
You talk like an eight year old, an eight year old that eats paste.
EXODUS 7:5; AND THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD, WHEN I STRETCH FORTH MINE HAND UPON EGYPT, AND BRING OUT THE CHILDREN
What really good things?
The American people saw through your B.S. this time.  You are cruel and despicable!
You need to leave the senators alone you need to go by by
A plan isn't what we wanted. WE wanted lower costs for medical care, drugs, and more bang for our $$$$. Low premiums are EZ if we lower care
Perhaps work together on a bill instead of behind closed doors it would get done.
You are not allowed to change the rules so you can win.
What happened to a straight up REPEAL?  Hopeless republicans can not even do that.
These worthless Republican senators need to have primary in 2018, 2020. #DrainTheSwamp
Isn't that the rule?
Let the obama care IMPLODE, Please!
I really appreciate all your effort Mr President!!! You were so ready!
After 7 year's the Republicans.:(
Ur trying so hard 2 out do the black man b4 u but u can't & it hurts. Just do u. U won't ever b great competing w/some1 who's not n the race
Such a simple idiot with a simple vocabulary in the greatest  position of America.Disturbing!
There's a reason for that
2018 -- here we, the people, come.  Can't wait!
ترکوندی توییترو تو یا رئیس جمهوری یا مجازی گرد ولگرد..‌‌
Boo Hoo, your own people don't trust you.
It is the law
You are an elected official you do not get to rewrite the foundations of democracy
Thank goodness for 60
2018 Can't get here soon enough!  #DNC @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr have got to GO.  #MAGA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @pnehlen
It must be nice to get paid,and you really do not have to get anything accomplished, and after working a couple weeks ,go on a break
You blocked her, but not me
President Trump knows that draining the swamp will piss off every snake living in it!
So now that you keep failing, the rules should change?
You promise a lot of things, and not one thing showed up on this so call Bill of yours. What happen?
All you care about is your own legacy. Unfortunately for you, it's a failure and most miserable legacy for a President in history. #Resign
May I remind you that it has only been 6 months in, Sir. Maybe too much golfing, Sir?
too bad you don't like America
You have no learning curve.  That should be embarrassing to you.  It is embarrassing to the rest of the USA 
Maybe we can make 51 votes for your impeachment. What do you think of that #youtwittertwit
Yes, you need 60 votes to line your pockets more than you already are. How do you love to screw America?Let me count the ways
Already putting an apology out that you will get nothing accomplished? Oh no sorry you don't do that. Your just started blaming everyone..
Harry Reid changed the rules for Dem advantage when they were in power. Now it's our turn. I smell an executive order coming soon! 
@DarLovesAmerica If,da Cons n gress just want to Obstruct, then throw,m the hell Out!They,r derelicts of their duty to USA!
Well, since they are so good, I am sure they will pass with more than 60... you don't need to cry to lower it to 51
Will you continue to bend over for Putin,Iran, Syria. While you control the most powerful military the world has ever known.
Hahahaha

Just figuring this out now Donnie? Read the Constitution, it may help.
