Narendra Modi terrace Gujarat people
We don't understand your overseas policy .
That's was sooooo embarrassing. As is every meeting you have with world leaders. They compare notes on your stupidity you know.
ABSOLUTELY loved these photos he seems very sweet & genuine ♡♡♡

Trump sir modi guru ji se boliye na up gorakhpur se Sansadiye seet ke liye mera name #Vishavajeet singh #09670164601#plz sir.
Trump sir good morning
Are you preparing to bomb Syria as we speak your Navy has been spotted!  You have no reason to do so!  That's a CRIME against humanity
Assad must go. In fact he should have gone long time ago. What kind of leaders do what Middle Eastern so called leaders do to their own ppl?
2/2 and Mafia related Organizations. Secondly those at #UNHCR not doing what they supposed to do is not a problem only to me, but to so many
Did you tell the PM any secrets, too? Or do you only do that with Russian officials? What's the word on that, comrade trumpsky?
 God gives helpful advice to everyone who obeys him and protects those who live as they should.   Pro 2
best Prime Minister of india @narendramodi ji.

واقعا دیوانه ای دشمن نادان
He looked embarrassed by you. And he was more eloquent in his comments
"A Picture's Worth A Thousand Words"
Go Trump Go!
Did you see how he laughed at you when you said, that both of you have something in common with the social media.  Not true!
Thank you
Yes, we missed it because the media didn't think it deserved coverage. They're butt hurt about being cut off from news briefing. Hahaha.
The Presidents media could not be Played......sounds like bull shit to me....  CNN  doesn't know whether to shit or go blind. Keep it up!
can you believe  the President of the United States being censored   Just like me... ..The Networks want my photos but will not show them...
Have Paul Ryan give monthly updates on what has been passed and the benefit to Americans. I am Republican and hardly hear any updates.
Keeping up on diplomacy and making sure our relations are improved at all times. Keep up the good work! Soon we will surely #MAGA
#Indiamurdabad
Oh, and Modi talks a lot about protecting the environment... just sayin'.
Hmm. Not wearing traditional Sikh attire. Probably didn't want to get harassed. T should read Modi's Twitter feed. So much grace :)
And the same commitment to corruption...
Do you even know where India is?  I'll give you a hint -- it isn't in New Jersey.
Hope you told him we are drastically reducng the IT contractors our cheap U.S. companies are using rather then hiring and keeping Americans.
Flat 10%
The orange one does not speak for over 60% of Americans. Let that sink in.
Did you tell him any secrets you weren't supposed to? #failed45
.@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @narendramodi Every day you spend out of Federal prison is an unearned honor, Donny. #Trumprussia #Putincare
