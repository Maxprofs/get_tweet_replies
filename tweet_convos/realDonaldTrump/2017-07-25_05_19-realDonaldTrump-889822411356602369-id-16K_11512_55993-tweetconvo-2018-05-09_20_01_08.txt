How are the Dems obstructionist? Do you know what obstruction means?

The Republicans *could* have a victory if their health care bill wasn't a yuge steaming pile of trump.
Its time for the Republicans to step up for us the American people.
WE NEED ACA!!!

WE NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM FINANCIAL RUIN CAUSED BY A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION!!!

YOU SUPPORT INSURANCE COMPANIES PROFITS!!
Interesting that your NON-Hero McCain will fly n to vote on TRUMPCARE; I hope he dies on the way!
Democrats are obstructionists  you are hilarious.  I hope people are finally peeking behind the curtain, "Oz" More #fakenews
Your ignorance is stupifying! Dems can't be obstructionists, you twit! They are in the minority!!
#WorstPresidentEver #LIARINCHIEF
#RESIGN
Remember GOP WE THE People Voted u in we can also vote u out since your not working for US but lining your own pockets!!
You only make things worse for yourself when you go DEM BASHING
If by "the people," you mean the Mercer's, Koch's, Trump's, and other plutocrats in the billionaire class.
Also, one can't "obstruct" if one is not invited to craft legislation in the first place. Stop w/ your Newspeak, already

Nope. Your Presidency is over.
WE THE PEOPLE SUPPORT ACA!!!

YOU SUPPORT BIG $$$

YOU SUPPORT SPECIAL INTERESTS!!

WE THE PEOPLE NEED ACA!!!
3 Years, 5 Months, 26 Days, 4 Hours, 40 Minutes, and 31 Seconds
When are you going to stop complaining?
YOU'RE @POTUS YOU KNOW THE FAILURE THST IS #Trumpcare.
But even with a majority, THEY WON'T.  LMAO@YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY
Nothing will ever touch Obama care
LOL!
Defeat Trump's Deathcare!
لا اظن ذلك فأنت ليس ذلك المختار !!!
How can 22 million AMERICANS LOOSING healthcare be anything but MEAN & EVIL? Are you on drugs?
GOP bill is not for the American people. Its a tax cut for the rich. We are not dumb.
Takes a special kind of evil heart to call taking health care away from millions with no replacement plan is a victory for the people.
No.
The biggest victory will be when you're no longer in office.  Sir.
6 months on the job and you still don't know how any of this works.  Today would be a good day to resign.
The #Dems r doing their job and protecting their constituents. I highly recommend that the @SenateGOP do the same w/out fearing ur bullying
Never gonna happen Jaffa face
Obstructing what??? You haven't passed one single bill. Not one!
Will you undermine investigation and fire Sessions?
Thete is nothing to investigate.  Total witch hunt. They all need fired.
Yeah you got that backwards, and weren't you a Democrat for decades and only converted to get elected b/c Democrats would not have u?
Why is it ok to steal healthcare?  Oh yeah, this is Donald Trump we are talking G about, Right? The man who takes theft to whole new levels!
You forgot to mention that pesky kid who is always hanging around.

Tiffany.

Oh, wait.
Sorry.
Wrong one.
Barren. 
Or Baron. 
Or something.
This Tweet speaks volumes. It isn't about the actual bill. It's about YOUR personal victory in getting the votes, and repealing OCare.
It's never been clearer to me that you are singularly focused on undoing everything Obama did, with reckless abandon and total disregard.
You don't give one GODDAMN about the people you were (allegedly) elected to represent. It's all about you, your ego...
...and your personal vendetta against Barack Obama.
Says a snowflake troll with too much time on his hands get a life
I agree. Our president does need to get a life.
You are a human bowel obstruction
Trump does? Probably. He DOES wear diapers. I suspect it's because he likes the feel of his own soil
WOW BOB WOW
Except the 21 million 'people' who will lose healthcare obv
It's actually 23 million now and climbing Ben. Trumpcare would be a total humanitarian crisis.
We the American people deserve better than to lose access to our healthcare. The rich get richer while the poor get sicker.
It is heartbreaking as a doctor to see our president strip healthcare from the most vulnerable people in our country.
And for what? To make his Goldman Sachs cabinet members richer? The same guys who destroyed our economy in 2009?
This is like a sick movie and the Republicans are just standing around clueless and spineless. They need to be held accountable too!
The Republicans are Trump's biggest enablers.
Yeah they need to grow a pair or risk loosing some senate seats. Loosing total respect for Republicans! Speak up against Bully tatics!!

Omg I can never un-see that!! Thanks for the nightmares dude!!

Sockem' a new one
Yes, repeal.  When the reality sets in, the GOP will die.

Shh. Take your meds.
#MAGA
She is a complete idiot!!!! I loved LOVED watching her face when AMERICA VOTED FOR TRUMP!!!
But America voted for Hillary.
USA is a union of states that put forth electors proportional to their populations. The USA voted for Trump.
No, electors are not proportionalto their states population since Clinton won the popular vote. You have an elderly system that is...
Per state, 2 Senators plus a number of Representatives proportional to population. Plenty of scenarios in which popular vote loses.
This will be a very interesting day for HealthCare.The Dems are obstructionists but the Republicans can have a great vic...
Erm all this coming from a party that is historically obstructionist. Oh yeah, and you lost
It's actually hilarious how badly you're trying to ruin healthcare for everyone else
How's that working out for ya @realDonaldTrump now that it's 10/21/17 and you've not passed any significant policies. EO's don't count.
The Republicans can only be victorious "for the people" if they ban together with the Dems to #Impeach your sorry Administration...
"Great victory for the people" - Translation: bankruptcy from crushing medical bills and suffering and early death for all.
We all fail with you. 
Here is a PREDICTION...

The Republicans Will Be Obstructionists as well...

Trumpcare is a FAILURE

PERIOD!
Dems Obnstructionists? Where have you been the last 9 years?  Remember the "Party of No?" Remember who shut down the Gov't in 2013...Repubs.
LEFTY HATERZ, CRY BABIES CHILDISH HATEFUL INSULTS 24/7 CAUSE THEY LOST THE ELECTION.  THEY LOVE PC CULTURE, MORE REGULATIONS, SOCIALISM
Sike
Another failure
You're the obstructionist. As in obstruction of justice. The noose is tightening.
Keep telling Americans that the dems oppose this. Idiot.
Quit calling Dems obstructionists!  They are not!  LIAR     #ImpeachTrump
well that didn't work out.
People of America, do you agree that any healthcare bill they press on us should be their healthcare also? Think they are rewriting theirs?
FYI, you might want to take down that pic of the boy scouts, since you totally humiliated yourself w that speech. Best not to remind folks.
The Republicans, your party, control the House & the Senate & still you lose. Your whole world is out of control. Loser on ACA & Russiagate.
Seems your republicans are doing quite a bit of "obstruction" too. Maybe they know something you don't? How to act human?
Sticks n stones break my bones u calling me names will never hurt me
I call b.s.again. Republicans hold the majority. True many are jumping shill with you in office. They know what your doing is wrong. Smh
It is not obstructioning Sir. It is voting for what is good for the people. Your idea of health care will kill many people including me!
At least Democrats know there is NO CAPITAL C in the word healthcare!  Ridiculous
not for me as you take my healthcare away
Nasty, dangerous, selfish rich people trying to take healthcare away from the most vulnerable. Really not something to be proud of.
I'm disappointed. We have the house, senate, and WH.. and a  bill to strip health care from millions of Americans?? #NOTVICTORY
Lol talk about fake news
You're like the bad men from stranger things and we're like 11 & the gang just tryna get some healthcare & not get fucked by the govt.
No, YOU are the obstructionist. Where is your replacement that you've had over 7 years to prepare? YOU FAIL!

sooooooooo, ? they voted to think about it ??????????????? WOW
Continued HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE!
Trolls/followers assume that by "the people" you include them. You only include the 1% #maga #treason #UnAmerican .@SenMajLdr
Victory for Republicans means people suffer
No, Dems had no chance to participate so couldn’t be obstructionists—GOP is obstructionist because of intent to replace rather than improve.
You should have listened to Johm McCain's speech.  Enough with the retribution.  Stop the hollering, work together.
Jobs, wage gap, money in politics, better healthcare ... Start working for the people & stop whining. You were supposed to FIX things!
Congrats sir you can't do a thing unless you start doing it , you have primed the pumps

Health Care is killing
Yes! When they impeach!

By totally involving only Republicans, you have split the country. You don't give a fuck about healthcare, just being able to brag. Sad.
Thank you for fighting against the path to socialized medecine the dems put in place with Ocare

We don't want the Republican Healthcare!!!!!!!!! The Democratic party is trying to save lives. YOU are trying to make money!
Everything you say sounds so.... unintelligent. I'm embarrassed for you.
The only way there will be a great victory for the people is if you, Mike Pence and Paul Ryan all got into a horrific accident
How or Dems obstructionists when after 8 years Reps still have NO WORKABLE plan???
Don't let the #SchumerClowns get to you! #MAGA
WHY DO YOU INSIST ON BEING FAKE NEWS MR TRUMP?
You do realize the majority of the people on AHCA are republicans right?
Shame on you, Mr. President. You promised not to cut Medicaid, and now you cheer as it's gutted. Your voters will suffer and die.
this isn't a football game where you talk shit on ur opponent. This is the welfare of the people #getout #yourefired
Funny you should use the word obstructionist, what with being an obstructionist of justice and all
Wrong.
No victory for the people, only for you & your crooked cronies!  Shameful!!
History will show u who the true obstructionists are... the GOP party of No
Aww. Poor Drumpf. You failed again. Is that because no one likes you?
no she's doing her job and not kissing your ass
You are absolutely the worst person ever.  Please delete you account.  Thanks.
So the past 8 years Republican obstructions and greed never happened?
Sad.
Fake
Deluded
Uninformed
Loser
Fraud
Charlatan
Snake-oil salesman
As usual, when you say something it is mere projection. You say what YOU are doing but try to blame it on the opposition.8 years but no plan
There is no "OBSTRUCTIONIST" plea when your party holds the majority in both houses Goofy...you're DESERVE lowest avg. approval rating EVER.
and the Republican party don't know what the hell they are doing!!! All they about is money and not people's  lives. All of you disgust me!
Yes !... if they do the right thing !!... work together!.. and back the President !!
...cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others. hmmm so what you are saying Dems are doing is similar to...
Cud you please just pass away. It really would be better for everyone involved
Victory for who?  Do you know what you are selling? You want a win, what are you  winning?
Ops... another loss!
We put ya'll in there to get things done ,don't do it an we can put you out
How?  Ate they going to impeach you?  Yeah!!!!!
john mccann called for everyone to work together. You the obstructionist,
Could anyone in your office please explain what benefits your healthcare plan has for American citizens. Any benefit at all.
This is where you bring everyone together and talk to them about working together.... but I don't think you understand that concept.
Yeah, 'specially those 9 Reps that voted with the Dems. Oh wait, does that make them Dems now. DEMS ARE IN THE MAJORITY!!!
Dont you ever think its both parties.
Asked Ms. Liang  from China:Can you give me ＄100000000 ？
It was the Republicans who drew the line in the sand by obstructing Obama for 8 years. A taste of your own medicine, not so tasty is it?
The Democrats are trying to help Americans. You and the GOP are trying to screw us and give more to your rich owners. #Traitor #LiarInChief
Let's have a party in the Rose garden. You can set your coats on fire patting each other on the back.
Interesting that u think "the People" are defined as they were in 1776: exclusively wealthy white landowners. B/c everyone else is screwed!
I don't understand why you continue to cite the Dems as obstructionists when you have a majority.
Republicans have not been in favor of your healthcare up to this point.
The only victory will be for the rich.  But I forgot, they are the only people you care about!
You do know that over half the country identifies as democrats or liberals. Right?
Then "Dems"? Support a bi-partisan health care plan.  Republicans victory is for insurance companies and the 1%. Can't you see that?
Your are the worst thing to ever happen to this great country. Sad!
"And believe me, I KNOW obstruction! I am an expert on obstruction! I can obstruction bigly !!
Obstructionist.... what did Republicans do from 2014 to 2016?
The Dems are the ONLY ones in Washington looking out for the average American citizen. You think we don't know that? YOU are a horror.
T'as déjà pensé au suicide Donald?
You are killing ordinary citizens with your alternative and you don't care.  SAD!
Democrats don't have to obstruct! R's know #GOPCare is bad medicine and can't line up to support #Trumpcare!! #Resist #ResistGOPCare
For what people???? Your rich friends???
F u
Stop using Dems as excuse for not getting anything done. Reps have both houses, in case you're not aware!
ARREST YOUR OPPOSITION, GLORIOUS LEADER!!!!!
It's amazing you call something a great victory when you are turning the lives of up to 33 million upside down, some that may not survive.
@realDonaldTrump you should use the word "obstructionist(s)" very carefully right now
this definitely  applies to you now
You'll be responsible for the death and hardship of millions. Murderous serial killer, put that on your CV…even Hell won't take you.
Get off the toilet....and take a nap. You are the worst president....ever!!!
I know a word about 32 million people when I call you right now
@GOP is dead to me. New blood only. #NeverIncumbents Except Patriots who think like Trump.
The rich people!
I do believe the Republicans control the house and senate
The DEMS are concerned about Americans. Sorry you don't.
if you call taking away health care from millions of people a great victory, then  you need your head examined...
And you're an orange clown!
A narcissistic fraudulent buffoon orange clown who needs to resign
Ohio loves you
@realDonaldTrump they have nothing planned... stop thinking about yourself
The dems have been shut out of the process. GOP has the majority. Still you can't get anything passed.
Dems don't control the House,  the Senate or the white house.   You're leadership is a failure.
WHY is ONE tweet per day about health care bill not enough for you?
Ha. The first horrible Republican bill was crushed last night. We will crush all of them. The people want to keep the ACA.
You don't have a clue what is the bill
The Dems can't obstruct! Republicans control both Houses!
