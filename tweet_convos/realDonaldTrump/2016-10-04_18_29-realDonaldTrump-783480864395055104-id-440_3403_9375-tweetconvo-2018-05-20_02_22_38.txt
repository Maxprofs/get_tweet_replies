@realDonaldTrump @timkaine you mean the Mexicans?  Like trump said right?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Sean you are embarrassing your loved ones.

Kaine is such a stupid jerk!!
if he wants to be tough on crime-start with indicting Hillary &Bill for their various Felonies over the Years
why should he he defends abortion. #cursed
Why do you want him to talk about defending rapists? Are you looking for a good defence attorney?  #VPDebate
Quotes Jesus"of abundance of heart mouth speaks". His heart full of rudeness,interruption,collusion with crooked HRC
Yeah all accused should be just punished. No innocence before proven guilty, let's become a Judge Dredd-like dystopia!
Our constitution guarantees the right to counsel, & the presumption of innocence.
DEMS HARBOR  ILLEGALS FOR THEIR ILLEGAL VOTE! HILLARY SHOULD BE LOCKED UP! TIM CAIN MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF LAST NIGHT
He did his job.  However, #Trump is accused of raping a 13 yr old.
Hillary is a old bag  she set the bar as far as women being first the love she let burst for bills young thirst
isn't he one who wants felons to vote?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Hey Drumpf only I and only I. And my puppets the John Birch Soceity types. And the Ku Klux Klan types
Or illegal email of Top Secret classified information.
Constitution gives all accused access to legal counsel.
Stop hating the Constitution.'
@seanspicer @timkaine
Why do Republicans hate every part of the Constitution that isn't the second amendment?
@HillaryClinton HRC has been defending rapist her entire life Must feel natural she probably doesnt think it a crime
BUT he did speak on defending AMERICA against YOU, thank GOD!
RIGHT ON:
as long as they let me get me and the DOn's sweet cocaine, I'm happy...ohhhhhh #drrockzo2016election
His running mate, HRC, seems to be on the side of the rapists. The one she got off long ago & the one she's married to
.@seanspicer  @DonaldJTrumpJr what do you have against the 6th amendment?
Mike Pence: Donald Trump never retweeted this and he doesn't have his own rape court case coming up.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Got to get tough on crime, no buts or it's on it. Regardless who's feelings u hurt
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine . As an attorney he did his job. That is what he is supposed to do
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Sanctuary cities that enslave many for corporations,take jobs,and bring massive crime, and drugs!
he was a defense attorney. It was his job. Check out the Constitution.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine should nobody have defended them? Is that not their right?

@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Our justice system is founded upon the presumption of innocence and the right to a defense.
heck, what do defense attorneys do? Even u r not that dumb Sean
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine donald trump,  http://gawker.com/here-is-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epsteins-little-b-1681383992 … # serialrapist
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine you mean like donald trump, serial rapist?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Abe Lincoln defended criminals too.. its called being a lawyer..
If not for rapists and murders, who would vote for HRC? #TrumpWillProtectUs #MAGA
This is the United States of America! You have the right to a fair defense! Also you are innocent until proven guilty!
@realDonaldTrump Quit your hateful race baiting.
You mean as a defense attorney, as legally required to be made available to defendants? Good point.
He opposes death penalty & mass shootings cause of NRA-friendly laws. He's a hero / you are a little Rep.
Vote @HillaryClinton
.@seanspicer Defense attorneys perform a critical service to society. Shame on the GOP and @realDonaldTrump for casting aspersions on them.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine isn't Trump accused of rape.
Are you not familiar with Gideon v Wainright? 6th Amendment?   @seanspicer @realDonaldTrump @timkaine
Really annoying immature and low class tactic #VPDebate #KaineShutUP
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Oh, you mean Mexicans?
Lawyers are required to defend some people they don't like
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine like the 6th amendment says they deserve to be defended?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Hilary's been defending a rapist for YEARS.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, let's mention the fact that his career required him to do so. Someone needs to defend even the guilty.
I read constitution. it says something about right to defense? Did you read that? I could have sworn its there..
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine sticking with this one, huh Atwater?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine  He was a defense attorney. A constitutional right for Americans. Once again a repuke attacking const
EXACTLY doesn't care about the Americans only terrorists and criminals that invade our country everyday and wants more
@realDonaldTrump Please read that troublesome document, the US Constitution, which guarantees any accused vigorous defense.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine as a rapist, you'd think Trump would be all over this
.@seanspicer: .@timkaine wants to tough on crime - fails to talk about defending rapists and murders #VPDebate
Clinton defended a rapist that raped a little girl an left her in a coma for 5 days an now she can't have children.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @timkaine oh really tell the 12 yr old Hillary vilified # Hillary the bitch
His sugar mama @HlLLARYCLINT0N would be out of a job
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine like trump?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine So we're putting defense attorneys on trial for  doing their job????
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine #yourfired candidate is a RACIST
... Wait,  are you bringing out the Mexican line again?
He's all for amnesty and no borders and Muslims coming into US. He's NUTS!
.@seanspicer @realDonaldTrump @timkaine don't know what Ur talking about. @HillaryClinton defended criminals? in America every 1 gets lawyer
@silentmajorityu @timkaine birds of a feather ... two peas in a pod! Kane was an embarrassment tonight! Should be fried with her
@silentmajorityu @timkaine @TerryLambert201 he and Hillary both defended rapists!She is married to one,they have a lot in common
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Trump is accused of raping a 13 year old, thought Paris Hilton was hot at age 12.
Maybe he'll have something to say about it after @realDonaldTrump is convicted of child rape. Oct 15th, right?
Trump never said they were sending rapists and murders. He said Mexico was. Big difference.
He was a Defense Lawyer, that was his job! The Constitution, demands equal rights under law!
@DonaldTrump_Rev @timkaine He talked about his faith, who like the Pope, is against the death penalty!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine He can't go against Benghazi  criminals @LindaSuhler @cnnbrk @VOANews @nia4_trump @dcexaminer @abc
The law states that every person deserves a fair trial. Even rapists and murders, as tough as that is
So you and the #GOP are against the 6th Amendment to the Constitution? Or is the only Amendment you all read the 2nd?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @timkaine Just say "brown people", Sean, so Trumpkins know who you mean.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine waste of breathe
That's what #lawyers do. Everyone's entitled to a competent #defense.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine It called our CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. Look them up morons.
GOP wants to love the Constitution - fails to read the Sixth Amendment (and probably the rest of it) @seanspicer @timkaine
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Not trial atty. Death penalty defense. Pro bono, BIG difference. Stop twisting the facts
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Everyone deserves a competent defense. Ask the British who had John Adams as their lawyer.
You've heard of the Constitution right? It's clear you've never read it but you have heard of it? Try reading it now.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @timkaine don't forget letting felons vote !
It's called due process. @seanspicer @realDonaldTrump @timkaine
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine are you blaming him for doing his job according to the constitution? Is that what the GOP stands for
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Pence has been amazing!!!
@realDonaldTrump < Be careful. He's accused of such. @timkaine
Oh, you mean the Willie Horton ad you're so proud of?  Idiot.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine he was doing his job as a defense attorney duh
are you talking about Mexicans?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine so you're against the 6th Amendment?  Good to know.
I am actually surprised the @GOP is so comfortable attacking a core American right. You really oppose the right to council?
wow Kaine is kicking Pence stupid!
stuff it, "Willie".
isn't that how our system works? That's like criticizing someone for prosecuting innocent people. Idiot.
TK coming across as full on Lizard Creepy, a head designed to sneak into places stealth criminal type
@TeamTrumpAZ @timkaine he can not keep his mouth shut he is a mess. He can't be president. Worst than Killary
Constitutionally we guarantee defendant counsel if one cannot afford & the court will appoint representation. U anti American?
yeah, what kind of criminal system defends the accused?
here is that attack on Catholicism again
Media, Kaine, and Clinton demonstrate their true colors when desperate. Trump and Pence love America.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Sean, are you saying any person accused of a crime should be denied a defense atty? Sounds like it!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine he was a defense attorney.
Upholding our constitutional right to judicial representation Sean. U have heard of that right? The Constitution thing
you're better than this, Sean.
oh another blanket racist reference to Mexicans from the republicans.  Shocker
let's talk about Trump and Mike Tyson.....
just poor form to giggle about it.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine ? about relig freedom bill pence passed in IN that protected a mother who whipped 3yr old w hanger??
@realDonaldTrump That is literally the job of a Defense Attorney and an adequate defense is guaranteed by the Constitution.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Speaking of Rapists...#NeverTrump #TrumpRapeCase https://www.google.com/amp/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/474726/?client=ms-android-hms-tmobile-us …
@TheAtlantic
... Like @KellyannePolls husband defended Phillip Morris Tobacco Co? How many ppl did they kill?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Come on! He was a defense attorney. That's a dumb statement.
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine you mean Trump, right? Isn't his CHILD RAPE case coming up?
@realDonaldTrump You mean do what Const. provides for, then have rapist take a plea, etter for victim, no trial for her. Awesome
You're a special kind of stupid. What about "due process under the law" don't you get?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine WHAT ABOUT BENGAZI??? We will Never Forget What @HillaryClinton DID and DID NOT do!!!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine you mean like trump?
"@seanspicer @timkaine wants to tough on crime fails to talk about defending rapists & murders #VPDebate" They're not entitled to a defense?
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Good try, guys.  You're going 
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine So, the guilty don't deserve adequate council?

#DonaldsAmerica #Debates
speaking of rapists--> @realDonaldTrump  @timkaine
not everyone who is here from Mexico is a criminal or rapist. Give me a break.
You are LYING!
#WRONG!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Once again failing to remember everyone has the right of representation!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine what about benghazi...4 Americans murdered on Hillary's watch. How many times did the military change
Yes, as did Trump in 1994. Right Trump? Funny how they jumped all over MJ but, are quiet about you!
@realDonaldTrump @timkaine Yeah, that damn Constitution that gives everyone the right to Due Process.
The 6th Amendment, yes, why would you ask? Now go away.
Wow, you are the most clever person in all of Twitterland. Blocked for idiocy!
