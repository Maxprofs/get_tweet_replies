Lower taxes on your rich friends in now way helps anyone but them. It kills the rest of us.
We don't believe you anymore, Donald
Kill the estate tax. #PoorTiffany
Show us your returns, or nah.
The moron has spoke again, why don't he just shut up???
How does lowering YOUR taxes (that you don't pay) but RAISING MINE help me? You, and the rest of @GOP are frauds and liars as always. SAD!
Puerto Rico what? Where?
If it want for the AMT, you would pay much less in taxes. No elimination of Alternative Min Tax.
So this is what a " DOTARD" is?
~ you learn something new every day!
Speaking of taxes.
Looks like a Trump tax return has leaked. Finally..

#TrumpLeaks Tax returns and more.  ~> @hardhouz13
POLL 

Would you approve a tax cut for all Americans that puts more money in your pocket??

Vote below and RETWEET!
40% would not approve tax cuts even if it benefits them. These people hate that some have more than they... all dems. Take a knee on the 40%
Awesome President Thank You and God Bless You 
SEND HELP TO PR.. STILL NOTHING FROM MY FAMILY.. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?? SEND THE  ARMY SEND THE NAVY SEND THE HELP THAT IS NEEDED
It's wrong... and only helps the rich... so pretty much what we expected from you.
26yrs Later ..,Is better then NEVER,
THANK GOD FOR @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & @FLOTUS 
TO #MAGAX10
So from the tax return we have of yours, this would give you a $7millikn tax break. You are a con man through and through.

Only the already rich profit from this.
The only tax reform we need is to make Trump release his tax returns.
It's kind of neat to see the Bible parables play out, though.  We've to the false idol, the Pharisees, false prophets.  What a way to go! 
Tax cut won't be of much benefit to you in federal prison jerkwad.....

@yesimpeachnow
@realDonaldTrump You have no team except the white robe/conehat team. You NAZI! Jones Act support while over 3 million are slowly dying.
Sadly , we cant all delete a Loser with a tweet.
How?
Lie #190

Another idea for the 1 percent
We don't need text cut. We need more tax revenue to pay for the war in a rack and other GOP mis-adventures
Why are you increasing the tax rate on the poorest Americans?  How is that part of one family, you hypocrite?
Trump’s failed Puerto Rico golf course has cost the territory’s taxpayers more than $32 million
take a knee
Take a hike troll and you certainly look like one
As a Colts fan I couldn't be happier to see this @JimIrsay https://twitter.com/10_gop/status/913125319820890112/video/1 …
I only just today followed you. And I'm absolutely not regretting it. Go get him, girl! #NeverStop #ImpeachAgentOrange
She delivers the fire while making you laugh.  Very entertaining follow.
I love it! Something I try to do myself every day!
Doesn’t help the middle class...aka the ppl that voted for you idiot
  LIAR
How about you  RELEASE YOUR TAXES
What happened to "UNDER GOD?"
PLEASE STAND WITH TRUMP!!!
He'll no!
Most of us math better than you do, Donnie Dotard.
Sorry it's not gonna pass
This is the right tax cut at the right time if you're in the top 1% of America's earners
Instead of concentrating on bills which will never pass why don't you concentrate on stopping this crap...
Just like healthcare this will be yet another giant FAILURE of yours
You are wasting time and making yourself look like an ignorant foool yet again
"as one team, one people, & one American family." 
Equals = white rich people...

#TaxReform
The wealthy crest businesses. That creates jobs. So what's the problem folks?
Ask Kansas how the tax cut worked for them...it didn’t, complete failure and they scrapped it.  People were greedy, no reinvestment
You said you wouldn't touch #Medicaid, #SocialSecurity, or #Medicare & yet u rooted for #GrahamCassidy. Why trust u on #TaxReform? #Trump
I wonder how students of #Trump university feel about your promises? What else do people need to know about you? #TrumpLies
How do u sleep at night?   guess after misleading people 4 ys, cheating contractors out of their pay, etc. you get used to it. #TaxReform
#Healthcare for ALL!!  Oh, oops, that didn't happen either. Now let's move on to the next con. #Trump #TaxReform
The real kicker is elimination of estate tax. That will benefit only the uber wealthy - no benefit to the working class. #Trump #TaxReform
Isn't the ELIMINATION of ANY tax a good thing??!
I love you @realDonaldTrump ! You are a good man with a great vision, you are the greatest President in American History since James K Polk
Why do you say Polk ?
Because James Polk did what he said he would, was selfless, and made this country what it is todayin a Short four years but didnt run again.
I do want Trump to run again though
I wish he could run for 3 terms!
We need more questions for these people who run for offices ..defense questions..?are u gonna defend us or them??
#TakeAKnee

If you are a sheep.
We need the state deductions and property taxes.
Please get rid of your Obama left overs out of there.
“YEE-HAH!!!!”
STOP LYING-Your plan DOES benefit rich incl YOU-raises tax rate for lowest income fr 10 to 12%-WAKE UP PEOPLE-START UNDERSTANDING TAXES
I did a whole post on this on FB. People better wake up quickly!
We want a full overhaul, true tax reform.  We want full repeal of current healthcare.  We want to create a new approach
Then why does it punish students trying to further their education while scaling back or eliminate the estate tax, which would cost as much as $172 billion, an expensive giveaway that would help only the wealthy?
Better hold back a couple of million for Price and all his flying around. @cnnbrk #SoCalledPresident
More lies from the loser

This is Jeffrey Epstein, known pedophile and human trafficker. Conservatives like to focus on Clinton connections, but look at Trump's quote 
Really disappointed in you regarding the tax reform bill! The upper middle class again take the hit.
When it should be the uber rich that take the hit! What will they lose a million off of their 300 million?
The TWEETER is a TWITT
Tax cuts for your rich friends and family helps no one but you/them. You are killing this country by not helping the little guy.  Step down.
Start by educating children not by punishing the uneducated adult
What's with the spirit fingers
Your tax reform only crushes the middle class and the poor and only benefits the 1% wealthy. You are a fraud.
Fake @POTUS, you're a tiny fraction of these:
Obama, Bush And Clinton Help Make The Presidents Cup Something Special
This won't help anyone except millionaires + will harm our country! @potus is a LIAR mobster rapist + taritor #treason $uck$ @GOP #impeach
Mr. President, I make less than 100k a year, have no kids and consider myself as middle class.Will I pay more taxes under the new proposal?
How many farmers benefit from the estate tax I believe in the whole United States it will be 80.
Hope is ahead for All of Us
Nothing but rebranded reaganomics. Your rich donors and big business pals thank you. Nothing to see. Nothing new.
Give tax cuts to the rich too so they can pass it down to the middle class
Where will the money to help #PuertoRico come from then? American citizens are dying and the government is leaving them to rot.
"It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it."
-MAURICE SWITZER
ONE BIG LIE.

#TaxReform is a scam. Billions to the Trump family. $100B to top 12 families.
By the way my dear middle class conservatives, after the hidden take backs, you have less and BUSINESS get big money. Enjoy #TaxReform #MAGA
F L A T     T A X
The middle class working family needs major tax cuts & health insurance overhaul
& rural USA needs major attention
Hope you get the obstructionists to act responsibly for a change.
How will this help retired military? I’ve heard our house interest isn’t helping us any longer. By the way Mr President I support you!
No tax cut for most of Americans who make an average wage-only an increase!  Check it out.
Well, if the estate tax is eliminated, as you propose, your children and grandchildren will certainly be advantaged-others, not so much.
Luv tax cuts. However, there must be greater spending cuts for it to work effectively.
You did the math this one is JUST for  you and the 1% - stop lying and release you taxes
This is the right tax cut for you
FOOL ... MOST OF THE POOR YOU PROMISED JOBS; WILL OUST REPUBLICANS NEXT ELECTION!
If the DEMOCRATS get in power again, they will RUIN it for America AGAIN! VOTE ALL ELECTED DEMOCRATS OUT, & STAY OUT! @foxandfriends
You and your team are great that's why "America will be great again "sincerely a very proud AMERICAN family. God Bless.
You filled the swamp - 1m in private jet cost!! Price needs to be fired - fly over the swamp pig
No, I don't think so. Where is this a huge help for the working class Americans? It looks like it is to help the richest Americans.not good!
Orange man your all green I would fire the tech
Where is "fiscal conservancy" in keeping the deficit under control?
Volunteer EMS and Firefighters are dwindling... How about a Tax credit for volunteers to give incentive to help bring in new volunteers??
You must just be talking about yourself and your fellow 1 percenters, cuz you're full of crap of you mean regular Americans
Yes, sir .but be careful as most of the questions asked of Gary Cohen were about would it help you.Awful they dont want cut
Does this include non-white middle class Americans?
Yeah, that extra $1k will help me buy a new car, or renovate my kitchen. Lol.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @Evan_McMullin @SenJohnMcCain Says the guy whose family will save BILLIONS with their pass-through and estate tax schemes. More for the elite Kochs, Mercers, Wynns et al. SORRY but NO!
This, from the most divisive Pres. in modern history HA!
DONT TAKE AWAY PROPERTY TAX WRITE
OFF..THAT WILL AFFECT SENIORS WHO OWN THEIR HOMES..THEY CANT AFFORD NOT TO GET THAT WRITE OFF
If it's a tax CUT, why are you raising the income tax rate on the poor from 10% to 12%?  So wrong!
We would hate to see you lose out in filling your bank account with more money. Unlike ur supporters, we can count.
Another failure coming right up.
You?? you are a Loser. resign.

#TaxReform would allow small business owners to expand their operations—and give raises to hardworking employees. http://bit.ly/2x2aMu1 
Bullsh*t!  Complete and utter bullsh*t.
I'm middle class and from what I can tell thus far, this tax bill won't help me. 
Thankfully, I have little faith in your ability to pass any major legislation.
#wonthelpme
Close the hundred plus military bases around the world and quit buying killing machines would be the most efficient tax cut
Another fail in the making.
SHOW US YOUR TAXES!!! Don the Con is so used to saying SHOW US YOUR TITS, changing it up is hard.
Go suck a bag of dicks. #Dotard
@POTUS @FLOTUS @VP @mike_pence @GOP #TaxScamPlan #NOTMAGA #trumppenceIgnorantArrogantCorruptAdministration
So, you want more tax cuts for you and the rich? This didn't work for Reagan and it didn't work for Bush! We don't need a tax cut!
Only good for the top 1%... you are sickening.. resign already...
Wish our PM and FM @narendramodi @arunjaitley take some clue and initiate something in India as well..However taxes are ever rising here

Do not want to be in your family of crooks, liars, and racists.
You know "trickle down" economics does not work
Compare Kansas to Minnesota !!

The fact that any American believes you is a testament to how desperately we need to overhaul our education system.
I suggest that the Earned Income Tax Credit be eliminated as well. It not fair that they get this benefit and they do not pay taxes.
Tax Cuts DO NOT increase wages. This IS fake news...bigly.
So...details? Besides trickle down (which is doomed to fail), we would like details.
You mean a tax cut for you and the wealthy while you increase the burden on Americans
And what will it cost and who or what is gonna suffer? Or is this manna falling from the sky ???
You are pitiful.
U best get this done or u r FRIED.
Why is he green?
Blah blah blah all I hear out of ur mouth and empty promises,just like the empty facts of the tax reform

We all know you don't care about anyone but your family & rich friends; you just want applause. Sorry - we can't be bought by fake promises.
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-tax-plan-boon-1-percent-new-analysis-finds-n806056?cid=par-xfinity_20170929 … How much profit will your private businesses get? So unethical.
#AbolishIRS #FAIRtax NOW. #VoterID

Your "tax cut" is a joke. All for the top 1% all while you cut programs for the needy children and others! #trumpisafraud
Kushner didn't tell senators about email account
Little of which you know anything about! White Supremacist & Bigot!

White House demands reporters ignore GOP tax hike on working families



…

Blah, blah, blah! I don't believe anything that you say!
God bless the President our Country is Great Again Mr Donald J Trump 
@POTUS liar liar liar
A tax cut is NOT tax reform.

$269,000,000,000.

That's how much the GOP #TaxReform plan would give billionaires like @BetsyDeVos & @RealDonaldTrump by ending estate tax.
As usual, you LIE about tax reform. Major benefits are for you & others like you. DISGRACEFUL. How can you INCREASE taxes for lowest bracket
Like your Healthcare debacle Americans WILL NOT allow this to happen. while the Rich get Richer on our Backs.
NO TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES! #ImpeachTrumpAndPence
and by "we" he means the 0.01%. #TaxPlan #TrickleDown #inequality
And more blah blah
Blah blah

RT @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer The #American People require both their Federal and State itemized Deductions (all) with no exceptions. #USA
a tax according to income sounds fair to me
2.3 trillion added to deficit. No guarantee for middle class tax break the rich yes
President Trump, spending cuts should lead tax cuts.  It would be nice to balance the budget and start to chip at the deficit.
Mr. Trump, I DON'T call you President BECAUSE YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT TITLE. Your BEHAVIOR is APPALLING. I've Respect FOR ALL BEFORE YOU.
ABSOLUTELY! Democrats do not want people to be successful and make money, they would lose control. That's what's called Communism!
The right tax cut for you!!! Estate tax ring a bell?
Drug Test for Food Stamps NOT CANCELIZATION
Do some research - trickle down economics NEVER work. Tax cuts by repub presidents have always killed the economy. Dems always fix it.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving Fathers M.A.D.D.
We will "grow together" as soon as you either resign or are impeached!
#TaxReform it's "pretty black and white"  release your tax returns!
You. Are a bad president I ever see and the true is that I,m Africa and I will nerve give up ok so bad so good
We arent doing anything together, orange man. You are going to prison. Good thing you like orange.
Some, of course, will succeed more than others. Gotta make sure the rich get richer
Fuck talkative liberasts who parasite on us. Thank you, Donald!
Does that include those of us who take a knee?  Or those of us who are SOB's? Maybe if we are a gold star family or disabled person?
