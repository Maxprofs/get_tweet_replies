I don't trust people who can find time to spray tan face and not little hands.
No.
GOP lies, cheats, steals. No ideas. Just wannabe dictator billionaires. Gorsuch will affirm dictatorship
Nope. What's good for the goose is good for the gander...
#RESIGN #SCROTUS
WRONG for America, but right for the billionaires who funded the commercials trying to get him confirmed. Another bought judge.
#ReleaseYourTaxReturns
Who cares about the dam tax returns what difderence does it make?

Your judgement is not good for America
do you think you'll leave the White House on a stretcher, in a straight jacket, or in cuffs? #evenmoney
Are you threatening?

Domestic violence is mainstream in Algeria.
"Do you beat her?"
"Yes, I beat her normally."
Christians don't beat their wives?
No sweetie. 'The Bible' does not hold verse like the Quran saying it's OK & ENCOURAGING MEN to beat their wife into submission. Just FYI....
CONFIRM MERRICK GARLAND!
Never! You are a traitor! resign!!

Merrick Garland should have been confirmed last year. #TraitorInChief #LiarInChief #ToddlerInChief
IDK man.  Not sure if you can just say "confirm" him?  You could probably say to vote up or down on him, but not a blanket "confirm" him.
The GOP wouldn't even give Garland a hearing. Give Merrick Garland a hearing first.
I don't think you should be able to nominate a Supreme Court justice in your last year in office.
FAKE POTUS -  NO SCOTUS.
Praying for you @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst
AMEN!
Hey Donald! Your IQ test results just came back from the lab. The score you got was: -3. Thank you!
looser
No, we need Obama's nominee. You stole this spot, & the American people will pay the price maybe for generations to come. #RESIST

just pull a Reed on them.
We are behind you 100% @realDonaldTrump! #ConfirmGorsuch #FridayFeeling @POTUS
Then maybe you can go to prison with him as well!!! #TrumpRussiaCollusion #45LiesAndLiesAndLies
 Dream on, sucker. You got conned by 45 and his Russia cronies. #TrumpRussia #russiagate #45IsGoingDOWN
We got conned on the Trump/Russia hoax..?

Make sense.

#MAGA
You WISH it was a hoax!!! #TimeWillTell Rumors are,45 is getting ready to bail on all of you. #TrumpRussia #russiagate #TheLongCon
#MerrickGarland
OK Martha, we notice you, but what is your point? What do our hope to accomplish by tweeting maniacally with no commentary? Explain
#Gorsuch is a real Conservative, a great man and a patriot.
Once we take back SCOTUS the Liberal-Fascist movement will be weakened forever.
Is this an intro to a new Star Wars movie?
"What if democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?"
My kids and I love star wars - but we know that its only fiction
Yes, great piece of fiction, written by George Lucas with historical events heavily inspiring the plot. Many great lessons in that movie.
there I agree - but it still is fiction and should be understood as such
Obviously we don't have aliens and spaceships everywhere, what is your point?
Confirm Garland first.
Donald Trump had nothing to do with blocking Garland.  Brush up on your recent history
No, Garland was just a perfectly qualified judge who was blocked by the republicans for no legitimate reason.
Brush up on your history buddy.  It's called the Biden rule.  Also, trump had nothing to do with that.
No, it's called Mitch McConnell wanting to block off the process until they could get a candidate who was conservative enough.
Right.... You love the blame game don't you.  Have you reached Bidens history in 1992???
Biden never blocked anyone.  You lie.
#ConfirmGorsuch #SCOTUS ...
release your taxes
What in the actual fuck does his tax returns have to do with anything? It doesn't benefit anyone! The man pays them
You've already begun your 2020 campaign. You are no longer eligible to nominate a judge. Sorry!
The hypocrisy of this whole situation is astounding. Also why on Earth do you feel the need to campaign 3 years in advance?
Should a president be able to nominate a judge while campaigning for the next election?
If you say "Yes", Obama's nominee should've been confirmed. If you say "No" then Trump is no longer eligible.
‚Ä¶either way Trump's logic, as always, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
You don't make any sense!

Hello Comrade. How weather in Moscow? Nyet to cold I hope üñí
So Chug is an anagram of Gorsuch and that sums you up you nasty birdy man.
No, it's not. You left the "r" out.
Sorry Sukey, check again.
So Chug and Gorsuch - missing the "r."
What "r"? There's no "r" in So Chug.
Yes. And anagrams use all of the letters.
Exactly. So Chug. Gorsuch. I don't get your point.

#ConfirmGorsuch
@potus your ardent supporters need to jump in as soon as you tweet to crowd out robo-tweeters.  Hey all you for him TWEET.
your biggest supporter!! I hope your holding up with all this shot the democrats are putting you through!! You got this!
Agreed. ASAP.
FU Trump, Confirm Garland
Praying for you, Mr Trump, and for Gorsuch, too.
No, Gorsuch is only good for business, that's why you nominated him. Don't worry, @marcorubio will vote for him. @SenBillNelson won't.
going nuclear
I hope the Dems ride you hard on this one Donny boy. Regardless of the outcome!
STOLEN SEAT,,,no life time appointment for potus under FBI investigation
Gorsuch will exacerbate USA's worst problem that Republicans don't mention: income inequality. Gorsuch supports Citizens' United.
NO
te queremos
No they don't. You do
not while your WH is under criminal investigation by FBI Counterintelligence Division. Let's be sure. You should want to as well, no??
No
America needs Judge Merrick Garland. #ConfirmGarland
like a fish needs a bicycle
you don't like judges, remember?
We can not  have Putin's puppet appointing Supremes. No. Sorry. #SCOTUS
No
Amen he will protect our constitution 
Gorsuch will be confirmed as soon as you release your tax returns.  Seems fair.
#RESISTANCE

no. You are ruining our country. #youretheWORSTpresidentEVER

@SenateDems , do not let your constituents down. Do NOT vote for this radical right wingnut. Do not.
Noooooooooo vote! Let's wait and see if your impeached first. We Waited one whole year for Obama and he didn't get a vote.
It's a new Day!  I fully support the nomination of Judge Gorsuch! Excellent man and excellent choice from President Trump!
Republicans set President on his way out, no Supreme Court pick. Obama, 8yrs term ending. You headed for impeachment - Russia collusion.
Nuke them if needed Mr. PRESIDENT
Yes , that's right , spread the lies we created you for. Yessssssss

The libs have nothing better to do than demand tax returns.  Very lame.  They ignore huge progress made  by Trump and damage done by Obama
your right
NO WE DON'T NEED GORSUCH
Nope!!!
No. No we don't.
Reminds me of judge from NightCourt TV show. Remember that guy Bull?
We needed Merrick Garland. #tangerinetoddler
Merrick Garland
Saludos desde #CordobaMexico
Block him, he is unacceptable and will legalize hatred
@emanpatsfan Yehovah protect you and your family And all the people that are good around you.
Also protect Secret Service
You don't get to pick a judge in your final year.
We shouldn't #confirmgorsuch until your #Trumprussia investigation is over. If u r guilty of treason his nomination should be cancelled 
Unvote Donnynumbnuts!
No
@Richardafowler 
More corporate money. More rich donors. More corruption. More politicians in company pockets.
We DONT need another conservative corporate hack.
Confirm this honest man. #no recess until our government comes up with solutions. No breaks We need healthcare and a SCOTUS Do Your job!
@potus seems to take a recess every weekend
What about Garland confirmation? #unconstitutional
THAT SEAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU! #garland or #filibuster
you spelled Garland wrong...
HELL NO!!
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wouldn't it be ironic if he is confirmed and ends up as the deciding vote on your conviction being upheld?  #SuckTheKarma
Go nuclear, we are fighting with you president Trump
The #GangThatCantShootStraight starring #TheDickC gw evil gunman w/#Goreysuch trying 2 bid 4 @ #DeadNForSale role w/@DonCon @DarkMoney help!
Never
#GarlandPayback. #NotScaliasSeatButAMERICAS
Its time for @SenateMajLdr to employ Nuclear option and get this over with. Dems do not wish to "play in same sandbox".
#garland
No to gorsuch.
I think the government can run just fine without the Democrats snobby comments and obstruction, time to cut the deadweight!
We'll pass. Thanks anyway.
Stop Gorsuch approval. Too funny auto correct put in Gorbachev
No Nazis on the bench
#releaseyourtaxes Sorry on this one  He will not be good for this country #impeach
In the next election I will not support anyone who does vote for Gorsuch

& we need a president who represents those who did not vote for him!
DO NOT cave on getting him confirmed!!!!
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  BLOCK GORSUCH
No!  You need to be impeached!
If they do not have the votes GO NUCLEAR.
Yes
@emanpatsfan please repeal hate crime. All CRIMEhateful. This is to silence the HOLLY BIBLE.PLEASE STOP THE ATTACK ON BIBLE
Judge G doesn't need YOU!
BENDICIONES 
I thought the rule was, "you can't appoint a judge in your last year in office" isn't that what they told Obama?
Congratulations!! 
No Supreme Court confirmation while you are being investigated for colluding with Russia to win office!
We need Merrick Garland.
America needs Garland
Shut up
Democrats  demand a "LIBERAL POLITICAL" judge despite Judge Gorsuch's stellar conviction in upholding the law!  Hateful Democrats!
@DNC @GOP Most Americans think we shouldn't confirm any lifetime appointments until we get this Russian thing figured out. #russiagate
We need a president too. One that isn't under an investagation. That's what you said in your Champaign. You and Flynn. Lock them up!!
Choo..chooo. Love riding the Trump train!! #MAGA
Why do we need #ConfirmGorsuch #SCOTUS does not understand the intent of founders -- #constitution is living document not #tencommandments
#jailPOTUS #releaseYourTaxes #DonTheCon #keepACA,  lost by 3 million. Just tired of winning eh?
@potus @TEN_GOP @deepcow @charliekirk11 @Just_a_Texan  We love Trump and need to reply our support when he tweets √ó√órobos√ó√ó
America needs an honest judge I'll slap your ass in jail . Not when you're hand-picked cronies
No no no no no no no no. Also, you are an idiot.
Nyet!
nope.
america needs forsyth like a fish needs a bicycle!
gorsuch
Not him, not you.
Confirm Merrick Garland first.
Democrats are vengeful with their corrupt agenda, they do not care for the people! Over turn like Reed did when corrupt Obama was in office
You shouldn't be appointing anyone while under FBI investigation!
he just someone to step on the little man while you and your friends make more money
GARLAND!  @SenateMajLdr and the Senate totally screwed up the last nomination.  Was that politicizing the supreme court?
Nahhhhhh, SCOTUS nominees shouldn't be confirmed during the last year of President that nominated them being in office.
America need a more computing leader, Gorsuch comes much further down on the list than that.
Nope, U do not deserve this!  That position has been open & it can stay open until you get impeached! #trumprussia #underFBIinvestigation
Nope.
global warming not true Rush Limbaughnis upset with your staff telling u to believe in global warming voters will leave u
Put theGOPe in one room tell them that anyone not on board better pack their bags. Use Dem created NUCLEAR option on EVERYTHING GOPe=cowards
No
#MerrickGarland
I would love to know why I don't get an answer to any of my tweets!!

NO! NO! NO!!
NO
Schummer is not voting for Gorsuch because Gorsuch will not be a lawless judge and won't be manipulated by the left.
You left out one word. You meant to say "American Corporations Need Neil Goruch". Cause is sure isn't the citizens.
Confirm this man He is the best one to fit the position
yeah like a fart in church
Taxes and Jail!!!!
Gorsuch has a history of not supporting the constutional rights of LGBT citizens.  America does not need him.
Use Nuclear Option, if necessary. DO NOT table it to get Dem votes, as suggested. Chuck the filibuster.
America needed Merrick Garland yet we were denied by the cheating #GOP. We can survive w/o Gorsuch until your Impeachment.
No, we don't.
