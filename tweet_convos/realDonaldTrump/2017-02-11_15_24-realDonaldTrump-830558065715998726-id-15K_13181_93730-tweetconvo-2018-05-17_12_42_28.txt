also, Google!  The winter palace is a reference to the tzar's in pre-communist russia. Are you aware of the implcations?
Not the winter white house. It's a private busines, which has hiked membership fees since you have conducted business there
very good talks?? a national embarrassment!
Wow Good job. I think Shinzou Abe Proud of you sir. 
DO NOT HAVE MEETINGS AT MAR-A-LAGO. IT LOOKS VERY BAD. FOCUS ON GIVING MORE POWER TO THE STATES.

@JapanGov Mr.President i hav been closely observing your talk since campaign. You r very soft hearted wraped with concrete.
President I believe in you.
DId he shake your hand? Because he was one of many who wouldn't shake Obamas hand...he saw right through him!
and telephone conversation in front of people with no security clearance.
Yeah, your talks were all over Facebook. You're the one guilty of the leaks. Good Lord, you're a dummy.
That is not the "Winter White House", it is your weekend get-away! Now let's be truthfull!
#TheWorstPresidentEver
ethics violation to have an open air meeting with dignitaries.
what's the last thing you Googled?
wish I could join you all
you do get Abe is his first name, right?
they could have care in the road in 6 mos that run on electrical plasma and dont need gas we could be polution free
Next time, try not to share our national secrets with a room full of strangers.
And confidential papers galore!  Great job Trump!
As a politician, you must keep information confidential. You have failed our country and you put us at risk.

#princepahlavi_trump_SoS
How much does it cost me as a taxpayer to fill your pockets by hosting such events?
They served "Hiroshima Duck" with "Nagasaki Noodles".  When the Japanese realized what is was, they got up and left.
In an open forum. So BAD!
what's wrong with Camp David?
Go Mr President  keep doing good work don't let these cry baby liberals get you down. They are just a bunch of sorry sob's.
By the light of a cell phone?  Was that a personal phone?  Did it use a personal sever?  Maybe we need to investigate?
did he help you with Korean problem?
just don't like the "whale eating" customs that they have. Other than that these folks are "great + loyal friends"
are you tweeting on a secure twitter account?
The winter White House?  We didn't vote for that shit.
这昭和么？Trump总统先生
Question is it physically possible for you to write a tweet that doesn't end with a super short non-sentence with an ! ?
Excellent.
While North Korea launched a missile into the Sea of Japan. Hmmm...now what ya gonna do? Tweet them "Straight"...
So you're back on vacation?
Next time don't let onlookers take pictures with their cell phones.
you are problem solved all over the world.I mean u ar maybe a good president. world people want to see u r good president.
I assume you're profiting from all yr Winter WH entertaining! Fake president
Next time, book a private room.  Think the owner can probably arrange that?  Dont need 2 put on show all the time
There's only ONE White House, Donnie Boy. Hint: it's not in FL or NY
nice job, talking about national security issues in a non secure location ... ironic
Thanks for putting your business interests before US security by using an UNSECURED location to conduct our business
Especially when National Security is threatened.  You still haven't figured it out.
Very public too. Great for your business parading around PM of Japan. Membership up is it? Everything's a commercial right?
