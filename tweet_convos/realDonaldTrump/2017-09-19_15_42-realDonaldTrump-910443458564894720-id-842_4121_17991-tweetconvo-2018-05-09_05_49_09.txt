wow... the number of replies!
I voted for Trump but why do they look like nobody was talking to them?  Vague expressions walking around, boredom--Jesus help us
If we the people dont stand we will fall ! That is a fact!

great tough language,  all the corrupt leader of third world countries now know with they are dealing,  ex presidents to soft on them,,,,,
You said what three past POTUS didn't have the GUTS to SAY! Remember they fought Reagan too until he broke Russia...
How ironic that @realDonaldTrump tried to raise the importance of the Constitution so soon after Arpaio spit on it & he endorsed the spit.
It was legal, just as the criminals Obama and Clinton pardoned. Get over it. "Ain't no fun when da rabbit got da gun"
"Ain't no fun when da rabbit got da gun" How kind & literate of you. Let me see if I can help
Direct quote, wouldn't change a thing. But thanks for ax- en 

Thanks! Oh, remember it's electoral collage votes not popular vote. I think you can google that FYI
Google this >> gerrymandering

That's what crooked racist politicians do to steal elections that could be easily won by a popular vote 
google this:                                The Electoral College and its procedure is established in the U.S. Constitution by Article II
Wow look at those people they can't believe it they're Spellbound at Trump's brilliance
"new sheriff in town", that's a joke, more like "look at that orange clown" trying to talk all tough that everybody laughs at & calls a fool
Only libtards
Wow, that was really quite eloquent for a Trumpanzee 
Thanks it means nothing from antifa lover
Define "antifa" genius

CNN (Very Fake News) is trying to destroy Alaska jobs and economy! Please help Mr President!! You are our only hope.
Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, The Donald opens his mouth again and tries to speak. A fool's leader.

Someone tell me of a sensitive liberal so I can troll them please. I'm bored.Thanks.
Indeed good sir.

If you think the Constitution is so GREAT why are you trying to destroy it

@realDonaldTrump But other nations in Africa are changing their laws for criminal purposes . Africa need great attention
Thanks to the President of the United States, Mr. Trump, who spoke of millions of Iranian prisoners of conscience

President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
Thank
You
@realDonaldTrump 
I honestly think that if @POTUS cured cancer the left would say well he didn't cure heart disease.
Ngài sẽ làm gì để giúp đỡ những người dân nghèo của mỹ!!!
I think the Nambians did it!
Great speech. Shows integrity and backbone
Sept. 17 was Constitution Day. Am trying to find how to share this on Facebook. Such great words on the greatest document of liberty ever.
If you're a Trump supporter you're a loser! So sad!

Hey trump shame on you
Go move to Russia of you don't like it here.
Amazing speech Mr President...praying for you! #DrainTheSwamp #TrumpTrain
Praying won't help #treasonisthereason
I kept going back to when almost all Americans, young to elderly, had our President's same values and visions. Good Times . . #MAGA 
Thank you
Every time this man opens his mouth he weakens the nation.
Well it's apparently working better than the NK deal
I wish trump posted the entire speech, it was truly an incredibly speech, and google currently has made it that much harder to find it.
“We are guided by outcomes not ideology, principled realism rooted in shared goals, intrests & values.” ~ @realDonaldTrump
How about #MUNGA: Make UN Great Again. And use this theme song -- #MUNGO is close enough for this bunch.
National Embarassment of EPIC proportions.
You're a good man sir
He is not the ppl. He ridiculed your country. He divided it to the point where americans are killing americans. He is not a president.
Awesome speech @realDonaldTrump   GREAT job!! Proud to be an American #MAGA 
Worst. Speech. Ever.
Go cry Snow flake, we won, you lost.
@RodStryker 'POTUS has all international leaders referring to NK leader as "Rocket Man"'!
OORAH!!!!!!
You have no knowledge of what the constitution or this country really means #notmypresident
As a person, I am so proud of Mr. Trump! Is a winner in life, an achiever! As American, Mr. Trump finally  doing what no other American did!
No otro abuelito 
The only good thing about this, is that this proves that the American Dream is alive. Anybody can be anything!
We the People are embarrassed.
Go move to Russia & see how you like it, socialist...
I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs."  Thank-you President Trump for serving us!!!
HELL NO! Do not count me among those people. I listened in absolute horror that this inarticulate, uneducated, bombastic buffoon spoke.
Ick
Even when he sticks to the script he is morally bankrupt...including all his supporters...deplorables...it was the perfect description.
Thank you Mr President 
Unbelievable speech! Patriotism is alive !!
God bless this man! America's medicine. May taste bad going down to some, but will truly make us better!
Did you literally reTweet a speech you already tweeted without any further context?  Your need for attention is absolutely unparalleled.
33 yo Kim Jong un keeps embarrassing Trump without saying a word. Kim Jong un is superiour in every way. 75 yo Trump is calling names.
Spot on Mr. President

I can't stand listening to trump's ignorant voice.  He is ignorant and language-challenged!

Dump needs reading glasses and also try to not go off script!! POTUS IS RUINING AMERICA.  SCHISTER, FRAUD, EMBEZZLER, BROKE BILLIONAIRE!!
After that whimsical Tirade Trump managed to both embarrass Americans who are Smart! And make USA the number #1 target for terror attacks
Don't think they are buying it

Fake news!
#WeThePeople #USAatUNGA #UNGA
Give em hell
I like how president Trump is being honest about foreign policies, but being honest can be dangerous for as imminent war fare.
Or maybe usa will disintegrate before iran !!! Just look at the usa annual income and then compare it with its debts !!!
What this land needs is true leadership! Not the biased party lines.., what's good for ALL not just the few!! Trump does not offer that !
So embarrassing....
To hell with all of the bs!! Trump is an absurd idiot!! If not being spoon feed someone else's word his true colors come out!!

President Trump, you really are something else. Thank you for representing us so well. I'm not for sure we're deserving of such a good Pres
What a horrible public speaker he is
He's an embarrassment to us all
The real @POTUS
Celebrate it instead of slowly destroying it.
