Also: please bring back the immigrants. I'm feeling too much whiteness. And pass Bernie's "Medicare for All" bill. Seriously. Thanks so much
Just fyi, idk why anyone cares if Ivanka calls u Daddy. I am 43 and I call my dad Daddy. And senior males in the South have always done so.
Really, you are staying where you should be every weekend...?
'first lady' is an immigrant fool who needs to stay in her hole and not parade around her cat lady face lift in public. #embarrassment
Wow. That was a rude and ignorant thing to say. You should really apologize. You have no idea who might be reading these.

Why not send supplies and food in Air Force One? They don't need you and the stripper there.

Not because of you satan.
Mr. President, since you are closing DACA, to send Hispanic children back to Mexico, why include children of white origin?
Montana is on FIRE... why aren't you going there?? MEDIA 4got them. Do their lives not matter?? 2 months burning up- please, HELP!
Why do feel like you have to broadcast the fact that you'll be working at the White House? Isn't that what you were hired to do?
