If you don't understand that this is a hot potatoe, and a complex situation, you're not qualfied to become president! :(
no doubt - number one area of concern - blast SNL -
Yeah. Trump probably has spent more thought about SNL than about the China/Taiwan conflict. Interesting priorities. :(
probably ? There is no doubt - just amazing that a person with such standing would let a tv show rule his world - pathetic
contemptible scoundrel
Good excited to talk directly to the president of the United States
.@realDonaldTrump As #PEOTUS you have a responsibility to be diplomatic. It would have served no one, had you refused the call.
Awwwww, diplomacy is hard isn't it? @realDonaldTrump
I hope that wasn't a State secret.
a president who never respects other country and focuses on its own interests
Oh my god. You're actually going to kill the world.

因為無論是在支那CHINA中國強國牆國內， 或者滯留寄居在台灣的中國人，為數不少的 都是有著錯亂的腦筋與脆弱的玻璃心。 　 ～～～
Because Chinese people with both in China or stranded in Taiwan , they have a confused brains and fragile glass heart.
Interesting that instead of informing yourself of what is needed to assume the office you watch tv and tweet.
Really Dude?..U might want to remove that thing from your mouth.
Jesus might be the greatest man to walk the earth, as you say, Tim. Donald isnt even close.
No argument there my friend, but we can all seek redemption and forgiveness if we choose.
I know I do, regularly. I need it!
