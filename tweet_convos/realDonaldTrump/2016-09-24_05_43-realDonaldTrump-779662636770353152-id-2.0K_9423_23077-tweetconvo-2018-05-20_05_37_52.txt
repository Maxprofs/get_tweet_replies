@PeterWStevenson
so why do you spupport Hilary????
Because she not Trump. Duh. She's not in court next month for child rape either.
right. For a new witness.
she filed it incorrectly in California. Without an attny. Pay attention.
@PeterWStevenson Did you even read? "He's the 1sr candidate in our history to be a serial fabricator."
it's very fortunate than that he is running against another one LOL. Why can't you Liberals see it?
Sorry y'all lose. #FactSlaps. Read about Russia (If ya have the balls) http://time.com/4433880/donald-trump-ties-to-russia/ …
http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-freed-child-rapist-laughed-about-it/ … they even cite the video that proves it was true... while claiming it was false lol 2/2
FFS. Have U #TrumpChumps NO shame?#RESEARCH. U ignoramus' ALWAYS post that. #Fail #Deplorable Distortion
did you just link the same link I linked to debunk the link? hillary in the video contradicts snopes' conclusions
Like Trump, do you only read headlines. "Mostly False"
conclusions was plural for a reason, I am talking about what they described as their reasons for the rating

Please talk more about the size of your penis. #NeverTrump #ClownTrain #DumpTrump
there's probably not much to talk about considering its a small subject
@PeterWStevenson kellyanne, you make a claim like that back it up. Clinton handed Babe his ass in debate
but the voters will say NOPE - and this professor has been wrong many many times  - verify that he's a prof
thought you didn't believe in all the typical political bullshit. Now you are the worst type of politician.
The likes of Brenda Snipes need to stay out of our elections!!!!
@washingtonpost Keep drinking that Trump Kool Aid to wash down bitter defeat on Nov.8!
TIME FOR HIM TO BE WRONG. YOU ARE WRONG. SHOW YOUR TAXES
@PeterWStevenson God forbid. Our country has come too far to revert back to the 1850's. @HillaryUSA16
@PeterWStevenson they should ask her to fix her hairstyle so her ears aren't covered.

@washingtonpost 
We the American people vote TRUMP POTUS. 
Don't want old tired woman
with brain damage
@GOPBlackChick @KellyannePolls @washingtonpost that's a perfect record. I will  agree
You are not going to win!  Say hi to your friend.. Jeffrey Epstein :)  The truth will come out, in time
@washingtonpost 

A guy named Larry in a bar says Trump's full of crap.
@washingtonpost the professor is predicting Apocalypse
@washingtonpost so hope he is right again
@mquinn6162 @KellyannePolls @washingtonpost praying for our Donald Trump our voice 
yes we all continue to pray.
@washingtonpost how much did you promise to pay him, did he predict he will never get his money
@PeterWStevenson Если не уберут по пути!
@washingtonpost This is the same poll that predicted Mr. Romney would win. LOL.
@washingtonpost did you actually read this before posting? Makes you look pretty terrible.
@PeterWStevenson did you actually read the article?
Donald, why do you encourage white supremacists? Not good for USA! #WhoisNeil http://bit.ly/295d5Gk 
Will Hillary still pay you even though she's losing? @realDonaldTrump @SoundCloud
God help us if he's right!
@washingtonpost #landslideTrump
@PeterWStevenson This election will be his 1st loss. There will never b a pres. Chump! 1 Hitler was enough!
LOL. Quoting the Oscar winner of liars.
i just subbed to WaPo the other day to read a Trump piece. They're going to have to start
giving the people red meat if they want to stay alive. Not a threat I'm making a metaphor
@washingtonpost it is our deepest prayers to have have Trump/Pence 2016!
@washingtonpost He a white supremacist, and he been wrong a number of times.
He also said you were so weird you could very well beat his system.
@PeterWStevenson Can you sound coherent for a change without the elementary words? Mess, horrible etc..
@PeterWStevenson if that happens, 70% of the blame for that will fall on DWS
Aren't you about due 2 re tweet a white supremist? It's been what a week or so since the last time you did?
The law of averages says he due for a loss. Trump U alone is enough for impeachment even before elected.
Hillary needs to be in prison. She has broken laws & statues just shows $$ buys u freedom!
You are projecting. Trump, the king of fraud has over 3.5K lawsuits before him right now.
Hillary has taken M$$'s from countries who oppress women, etc. She sold r country!
And Trump stiffs the working man, rips off single mothers and steals from his "charity".
Hillary foundation spends 90% on salaries & travel. Foundation worth billions. Tax free!
Fact. 86% of Clinton Foundation goes to charity. Trump uses his as a slush fund.
No it's already been proven 90% pays for salaries, per diem, & travel. Clinton's answer!
Quoting scripture for a con who has been married 3x, cheated on his wives, robbed sm businesses . . . ???
@washingtonpost
Push Trump Push !!!
@washingtonpost @seanhannity @LouDobbs @SpeakerRyan Trump wins w/Massive Landslide = 300+  Electro VOTES!!!
Massive Popular VOTES=Landslide. In WH, Jan. 1, 2017!!!
@PeterWStevenson Your are not smart enough to understand the points he is trying to make! Watch it again!!
He is pointing out what Clinton and president need to do! And saying nothing good about u!
I suggest everyone watch the video and vote too!!!
just like Lil trump being scared a moderator would call him out on his bs
She us afraid to be startled. Put Monica front and center!
and trump is afraid to have his lies be called out by any moderator
I look at diff. Hillary NEEDS the liberal moderators protecting her like Obama did. #maga
if trump isn't so scared of moderator then why did he want to debate without one?
please provide a link about trump staying him being scared of  a moderator
@washingtonpost need to understand ptsd better text me
Be sure to read thru where they call trump "a serial fabricator"
@washingtonpost that idiot hasn't taken into account how bad Cheeto Benito is...
or anything else
he works at my uni too. I hope i don't meet him. I'll tell the bastard off
@PeterWStevenson 
Welcome to the end of the world if that happens 
#NeverTrump
@washingtonpost Love Donald.  He is one tough cookie
Hope Donald wins
@washingtonpost No, Trump is heading for a lost.

@washingtonpost my god I hope so we can't win with Hillary. We've had enough of her.
@washingtonpost 
Well I hope not.He is likely 2 start WW3with his big mouth.
No class-morals-values-manners
@PeterWStevenson
I see why she is a wanted model
CLINTON/KAINE - because I'm sane!!
#NeverTrump
Hillary is a criminal career politician, and a sick person!
What about #DonTheCon's rape of a 13 yr old??
Gloria, that is not a fact. It is fact that Hillary got off a rapist and knew he did it. YT it and listen to Hillary herself.
Open your eyes to the truth!! 
#NeverTrump
This is just accusations, and the timing is no coincidence. The points about Hillary are fact. She is a career $$ politician.
I guess this is just accusation too? He'll be too busy in court to be POTUS. He's a #ConMan!!
ironic considering trumps lies, criminal activity and the facts of his racial ignorance and outsourcing jobs for a lower cost
you really don't know how businesses stay competitive do you?
also I do recall trump racking up 6 bankruptcy points
he never went bankrupt. He had 4 companies file for chapter 11 bankruptcy.
@PeterWStevenson dude looks like Marty McFly dad in back to the future.

@JenGriffinFNC @KellyannePolls @washingtonpost I wouldn't rest on that prediction. HRC been nominated by the DNC/GOP cabal.

Hey idiot, did you read the piece?  He thinks you're the worst scum and so might lose despite his model. Congrats!
Well, he has 13 variables to explain 9 obs, that's absolute nonsense from a stat & methods perspective.
@washingtonpost Good, so he has had plenty of time to plan his escape before you blow up the planet.
Guess you missed this part of the article, you #deplorable #charlatan.
