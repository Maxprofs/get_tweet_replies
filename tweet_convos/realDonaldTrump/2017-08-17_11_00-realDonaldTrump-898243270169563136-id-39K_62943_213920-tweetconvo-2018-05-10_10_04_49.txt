You are an unrestrained hypocritical RACIST reprobate. I condemn your vile rhetoric and support for bigotry in this nation!
1 DAY after LYING about needing time to 'get the facts' on #Charlottesville b4 condemning WHITE SUPREMACY ur condemning terrorism in SPAIN?
When did you get the FACTS on events in Barcelona? How come it took 48 hours to get FACTS in the USA & you got them in 2 minutes from Spain?
You NEVER needed FACTS! You could care less about facts. You don't believe white supremacist violence is terrorism.
You think the 'alt left' deserve to be beaten and terrorized by your KKK and neo nazi friends. You are utterly DESPICABLE!
You belong in a museum with Bull Connor and George Wallace. You are a disgusting fossil of racism's hey day in America trying to live again.
HEIL TWITLER!!
How can you represent the church and spread this type of content? The greatest commandment is to love one another as Christ so loved....
But it took you *days* to "gather the facts" to condemn white supremacists here? (Before then taking it back in your unhinged press rant)
He sent his " best regards" #NotMyPresident

Worst president ever!!
Evaaaaarrrrrr!
Anybody got a spare darlect around? It would make a better President. 
This not WAR
This is pest control
Wubba Lubba dub dub
I don't know how I missed this! 
That's an insult to daleks
Did you have ALL the FACTS before you made this tweet? #hypocrite.
Well actions speak louder than words. I watched him speak and then his actions contridicted what he said. Definition #hypocrite
That's the grand thing. I will never be in his shoes. I wouldn't want to be. Oh oh...I know...send my thoughts and prayers.#GOP
He is not a leader. He is supposed to be a representative of the people of the United States. He is representing only himself. Sad!
I stand with my President against the Muslim Terrorist in Spain, against the KKK nuts in Virginia and against BLM and Antifa & all extremism
No mention of terror attack killing Heather in Charlottesville
So tired of negativity 
But in between my pussycat posts I'll slip in some distorted nonsense about anti-confederate protesters...then complain about negativity
If Obamacare is so great, why are you resistance people all batshit crazy?
Because of those 5k deductibles. It's hard to seek mental health care when you can't afford the deductible.
No gràcies! No necessitem la vostre ajuda!  Em vist lo que feu als països que voleu ajudar!  Vade retro Satanás!


Why don't you HELP European PATRIOTS and HELP US PROVE, that MERKEL/SOROS et al, are PUSHING #AGENDA21, WHITE GENOCIDE, in EUROPE!


OMG OMG I can't believe you just tweeted that. Plz leave the Ladies out. U must ff eachother,my imaginary friends @uarethequeen @AATRHF 
???
Creo que mi hermana es más compatible con ustedes que conmigo en cuanto a políticas . But most importantly you both supported her immensely
......?? Lost supported Margaret
#ASPF I will always remember & be thankful for your support towards #SuicidePrevention 
Thank you Margaret you are a beautiful soul
Ahhhh thank you Lisa. We were Betsy B4 damn politics 
Thank you for your solidarity. Catalans are, have been, and will always be people of peace. #Democracy will overcome terrorism and barbarism
Si lo pones en catalan pues no te entiende joder hasta en atentados
Está en inglés. Si es que lo vuestro es vicio
Ok Antonio & JC all I understood is: if you say it in Catalan they won't understand until they're bombed & it's in English, why be viscous?
You'll never get it; it is a thing between Catalonia & Spain. I guess kindda Texas & Washington DC. But Catalonia has + glamour Catalunya.
Pray tell I need to understand! Mom is Canary Islands. Dad is Asturias. Where does that leave me?!
This is on you Trump.
he failed to call out the white supremacist.  It made them more brazen.
Then the 2 sides of Charlottesville bullshit
My grandfather fought Nazis so we shouldn't have to
He failed to denounce them. They got more bold. It's on him
Don't get distracted folks! #TrumpRussia
@maddow is still talking about Russia. Glad she is. She is always on the ball.

Thank goodness!
Strange how you condemn this terrorist attack in Spain on day 1 yet wait to condemn the murder of #HeatherHeyer. Fucking Hypocrite.

Thankful that we have a strong Leader in America, Praying for all who were affected by the attack in #Barcelona
Email discovered connecting the Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton Tarmac scandal to the Obama White House.
Of course! It's been there all the time!
You will be recorded as the worst president ever, a traitor, & the 1 responsible for the darkest time in the history of US.

#TrumpMustGo
This is the truth and I knew this the moment you were elected. An orange buffoon with a Twitter account will not prevail. #notMyPresident
That is absolutely correct. I will leave that to the Congress
We have the right to speak our mind. Don't back off.
I'm just not engaging with trolls but not afraid to speak my mind.  We cannot normalize what is happening in our country.
This is why we need to #BuildTheWall asap
Link please.  2010?
Yes, it´s terrorism in #Barcelona as it was in #Charlottesville 
Let´s firmly condemn it, no matter where it happens and who the attacker is
Le falto PARIS.
Estocolmo, Bruselas...
Y le falto muchos más atentados ocurridos en África y Medio Oriente,no por qué no sean países del primer mundo o potencias hay q olvidarlos
How is repeatedly denouncing racists and hateful people (ON BOTH SIDES) a bad thing?
We condemns the Terror Attack in #Barcelona #Spain
Do you think the biggest terrorist factory is Pakistan &
First of all, need to finish it
Why should not it be so long ago that terrorism from Pakistan is eliminated, it is now too late
If you’re OK calling a guy driving a car into people in Spain a terrorist, why won’t you say the same about white dudes doing it in the US?
racism, but mostly he's a coward
I thank God every night that we have a POTUS who actually fights to keep us safe-even if half the country doesn't appreciate it.
I hope you have supplemental income to help-since you're a paid troll 47!!
Donald Trumpeta a por los yihadistas revientalos a ladrillazos
me estás diciendo que ha habido un atentado cerca de ti y no te has preocupado por nadie
Y tengo que publicar por Twitter por quien me he preocupado ahora? Hay una app que se llama WhatsApp
tienes seguidores de barcelona
Ahora tengo que adivinar quien es de Barcelona y preguntarle si esta bien?
poner un tweet deseandoles lo mejor igual?
Desde cuando me tienes que decir tu ami lo que tengo que twittear que pesadito te pones
no lo hago.
Thankyou Donald Trump, I wish people could see the true you and not the false you that the media have created. Blessings to you x
False him? Did you not see his press conferences this week?
Yes, great speeches as always, I know a lot of people have been upset by them, cannot see why? Best president the US has had for years.
Worry about your own country you sociopath
You know that other world leaders also condemn travesties like this too?
You need more research
好好


Please no involvement with NWO or globalism or UN on USA  land. Zero blue hats or white hats on USA soil.  No $$ for climate change!
Si fuera condena sincera, #USA dejaría de bombardear en #OrienteMedio, de ayudar a jihadistas y de llevar el terror y la muerte por doquier.
Nice of you to immediately condemn terror in Spain, but refuse to acknowledge domestic terrorism or white supremacy in the US. SAD!

Oh such tough words for those countries, what about our US born and bred terrorists? #FakePresident
You condemn the terror attack in Spain, but not the one here in Virginia? Hmm
Yes
Американские спецслужбы месяц назад предупреждали испанских коллег о готовящемся теракте. Назывался город, который должен  стать мишенью для
террористов, но и улицу Рамбла, на которой террорист  за рулем фургона въехал в толпу туристов.Может сами и организовали спецслужбы США?
Gracias amigo!!
Just know that you will long be remembered as the worst president in history!
But only by those on the left and right coasts who were positive that Hillary would win.
He's losing support extremely quickly
My friend just did an informal poll for Trum voters only. Do you still support him? 72 yes. 1 no
There is so much chaos surrounding this man, that it will not be long before he resigns to avoid criminal charges
You wish brother. Meanwhile 3.7% GDP growth (Obama never broke 3% in 8 years) and he just backed down Kim Jon Un
And no, it's not 3.7%. Last quarter 2.6%. First quarter 1.2%.  http://Www.bea.gov 

.@realDonaldTrump Let's firmly condemn #terrorism, no matter where it happens or who the attacker is.
#Barcelona #Charlottesville
Interesting how much faster you condemn terrorism when the terrorists aren't some of your own supporters. Fascinating!
So you admit that if a political extremist deliberately drives a car into a crowd, it's #terrorism.  I agree. Now say it 4 #Charlottesville
So disappointed in you this week ! You talk way too much ! Voted for u and  I'm starting to regret it. Finding it hard to defend you!
Please stop the refugee resettlement program. We are funding our own demise.
Yeah, why bring in refugees when you can have home grown terrorists commit the exact same crimes?
#ImpeachTrump #NoTrumpRallies #NotMyPresident #ImpeachTrumpNow #DoSomethingGOP
EN CATALÁN NO. ESCRIBE EN ESPAÑOL HIJOPUTA!
Yet you do not condemned your #terrorist #whitesupremacist... Your key voters of #domestticrerrorism #FakePresident #theressitance  
Thank you for your kind and compassionate words President Trump
What is happening with Islamic terrorism is a global threat. Europe is doomed because they can't name the cancer attacking them: it's ISLAM
Don't worry @POTUS  .. America will vote them out one by one in 2018. We'll replace them with #MAGA
DONALD wir mögen Dich in Europa, und unsere Medien brauchen Dich mehr asl Du denkst, ansonsten haben sie NIX zu MELDEN, Merkel im Wahlkrampf
Days it took to his 61% Disapproval:

Carter: Never
Reagan: Never
H.W. Bush: Never
Clinton: Never
W. Bush: 1,932
Obama: Never
Trump: 207
You really are the president of united state of america blessing for you and family .

Why is it that you'll condemn this terrorist attack and not the one in Charlottesville???
Must sting that @BarackObama got 1.4M likes for his more inspired statement. 7 times more likes. Let that sink in. 7.times.more.likes .
Thank you POTUS for your strength and resilience against all odds!  You have lots of love and support!

While you are currently funding Tibetan & HK splittist terrorists. Yeah thank you
But, @realDonaldTrump you repeatedly FAIL to condemn homegrown terrorists. But you calling someone a white supremacist would be SO ironic
So you'll call this a terror attack but not the violence in #Charlottesville?? You're not fit to be president...
If only you had said that about your supporters a couple days back.  And btw, how about Russia and your taxes?!!!


We need to laugh. It's been a long week. 
Yes, thank you for this gem. I want the world to see this and have a laugh. 
Ofc. RT RT RT 
Don't you need time to FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON!? It seems like you know terrorism when you see it—just not when it's in America.

The dead in Oblivion and this MF still alive.
Next
just fuckin cuss out the KKK Uncle Donald fuck those Motherfuckers with a 1000 foot stake. Go with fuckin attacking David Dicksucking Duke.
Fuck Barcelona Im about Pittsburg and Chicago lets go Uncle Donald we do not care about Europe and remember its a DISASTER there. Sad.
Trump seems to forget
Are you condemning both sides? Unclear
Thank you, President!
Oh please. You don't condemn the terror attacks that happen right under your nose but will preach about peace when you're not involved.
But Charlottesville was a different story...right?
We know PT, that you're a good, decent, and patriotic American. I pray you never stop fighting. 
Start by locking up your own terrorists -antifa
Where were those words for Charlottesville? Never heard you say terrorism, or express love for the city or its people.

Your own country.
Surprising how you don't condemn the domestic terrorism committed in your name.
What about the terror attack in Charlottesville, Virginia?
UNITED NATIONS IS PUPPET ORGANIZATION CONTROLLED BY AMERICA
Hope you know what you're doing letting Bannon go. I haven't heard this much crowing from your enemies since you canned General Flynn.
Keep them out of America please.
A car used as a weapon in Spain= Terror Attack. A car used as a weapon in the US= Bad people on both sides #hypocrite #FailingPOTUS
Seriously???  why couldn't you have said this shit in relation to Charlottesville, Va?????
You ONLY love yourself #resign #impeach #DumpTrump #getoutofthewhitehousealresdy #yousuckaspresident
We hope not to have you help. We do not really need it. 
We don't want to be involved in the same problems you are.
send nukes

@SecretService when I was working in the WhiteHouse during Reagan talk like this was met immediately with an arrest what happened PC cowards 
This country is going down in flames.. @POTUS is trying to drain the swamp, too many power hungry Politicians want to get rich an screw us

KKK Nazis Alt-right white nationalists in the U.S are domestic TERRORISTS. Have caused more harm than Muslim extremists on U.S. soil. FACT
Where was this immediate condemnation when the Alt right rammed a car into Heather Heyer and injured others in Va? You took 2 days to speak.
How did I miss the same heartfelt reaponse for #Charlottesville #HeatherHeyer #DeandreHarris #FlintWaterCrisis  #PoliceBrutality #Healthcare
As a citizen from Barcelona I can tell you the best u can do to help is TO CONDEMN THE CHARLOTTESVILLE TERROR ATTACK AND IMMEDIATELY RESIGN
Stop destroying middle east countries, also, that would help a lot also. And then resign.
Number 1 terrorist in the world is you, Donald Trump! You have already killed more people than Obama!
Jérôme,Dodger You guys need to resign from tweeting all that hateful words I don't know what difference between KKK and you guys
Oh, that is probably because you cannot tell the difference between anything and anything else. But keep trying, Elvis.
May Almighty GoD help an Assists you my President
But not the terror attack in your own country???
@Jjzgz10 alas something nice ... how perfect timing #FridayFeeling
Hang in there Pres Trump!  I love you & pray for you & your sweet family daily!  Sure that thousands more do the same!
Donald j Trump.Charity begins at home. Nobody trusts you when you denounce terrorism abroad and condone domestic terrorism
Yet you won’t condemn the godamn neo Nazi and white supremacists that are spreading all over the country like wild fire.
I agree for Barcelona, why when we had a Nazi kill ppl with a car in VA did you not use such strong words against his actions & group?
Me, still waiting for you to call what happened in #Charlottesville an act of #domesticterrorism #ImpeachTrump #resist #nazisarebad
What about the terrorism going on in this country? Right... just ignore it.
They hardly do anything about that
No, because they are too busy creating it!!
, I think you must your head seen to, and those that advise you
Mr. President, so much has happened in a year and much has happened since you became our US president. I believe in making America Great & U
I was looking for some brain cells on Sean Spicer twitter feed. NONE found! Absolute idiocy. RESIGN YOUR COMMISSION from Navy Reserve, POS!
be tough and strong nice talk Mr President

Llevaos al Mariano, porfi
Thanks Mister President !
トランプ大統領を支持します。オバマは偽善者で無能でした

"Man wearing explosives vest shot..." Nope no Islamic terrorism here. Must be workplace violence? #FakeNews https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/world/europe/spain-catalunya-barcelona-imam.html … 
Thank U Mr. Trump, I´m spanish and muslim. We need help to defeat salafism/wahabism, only then peace will back.
Another tell: narcissists love to say "we love you"
BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
Your words are so meaningless, usually hate filled.  Your favorite is to use blood as your shock value or refer to dogs, too stupid to know.
That's rich coming from a terrorist and a traitor.  Should have stuck to reality TV
We love you in the WH Gorka
The EU better wise up open borders isnt working
You don't know the meaning of the word LOVE
Thats our Pres!
We need to stop this terrorist at home. It goes by George Soros.
Maybe you should start by stop supporting the yihadist in Syria instead of bombing who is fightin them
Thank you for your regards, since Spain 
I fear that ALL these attacks are "false flags"! Perpetrated by an evil Globalist shadow government. Pray America, because demons run amuck.
He's generally an idiot but this tweet was actually on point so not sure why people are jumping on him.
We have many millions of working, progressive and peaceful citizens who support it
.Mr. Trump, the agitating individuals who criticize his form of government are directed by his political enemies.
Just wanna say I'm a Donald Trump fun. Wish we had a president like him here in Spain
Where was the love when terrorism was happening in your own country?  Oh that's right encouraging it
Love and unity.
El asesino de Charlotteville mató por odio, pero claro es blanco, americano e igual te voto...
Ya y luego le vendes armas a estos grupos terroristas no? HIJO DE LA GRAN PUTA PUTO HIPÓCRITA DE MIERDA
And yet you don't condemn Nazis and White Supremacists?
So vehicular manslaughter in Spain is Terrorism & when Nazis in Virginia do it is no bo
If deal huh? So sad donnie. #RESIGN #ITMFA

Why didn't you say this about Charlottesville? Please designate white supremacists as terrorists!

OMG!! You're talking about a fairytale and you have an imagination like my 5 year old daughter 
"we love you"???.....omg you're an idiot! Where do you come up with this shit? #45isajoke
Europe keep taking refuges. 
Thanks. 

Read the Death of Europe. 
It is ok to protect your own culture.
But you did not.
Good luck
Too bad you won't condemn the terrorists that killed a girl and wounded many others in #Charlottesville. #ImpeachTrumpNow #DumpTrump
Pretty sure you need to focus on & condemn the terrorism in your own country first buddy. #WhiteSupremacistsAreTerrorists
No queremos la ayuda de un estado que implantado el terror y el terrorismo en muchos paises. Y no queremos mas muros. #NoRacism #NoBorders
