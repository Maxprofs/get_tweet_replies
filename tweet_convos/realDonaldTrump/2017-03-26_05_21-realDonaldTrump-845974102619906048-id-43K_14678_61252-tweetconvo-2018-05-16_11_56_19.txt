So TRUE 
The IRONY 
#ImpeachTrump
praised @SpeakerRyan ,then he tweeted 2 watch @JudgeJeanine 2night.She called 4 Ryan 2 step down.
"I guess I can't be doing so badly, because I'm president, and you're not," @realDonaldTrump told a reporter http://cnn.it/2n0gZTc 
.@realDonaldTrump Actually, the people who kept Planned Parenthood and the ACA safe from you were the millions of constituents with phones.
.@Shayla_Mars @realDonaldTrump No. The AHCA failure directly relates to the popular vote majority, which will continue to have such effect.
.@Shayla_Mars @realDonaldTrump I just got these cupcakes. The green ones are "Grasshopper" bc of some very nice news. Do you like cupcakes?
yes. The HFC is a fringe minority. Nothing will come out of the lower house this term without constituent okay
.@realDonaldTrump Actually, we're smiling nationwide. You'd smile, too, if you actually cared if Americans live or die. #ACA #healthcare
well said Litsa, as if he would really care, he can't fool some of us , only the idiots that will follow
Thank you! I think, increasingly, more of his supporters are realizing they got played. Midterms 19 months away. Let's do this!
Although I agree with the anti- GOP, I'm just happy you're getting involved.  Stay informed!
I will never stop paying attention, calling, protesting, complaining WHATEVER it takes
Been doing it all our lives.
I mean, yeah. We got the best possible deal for America in that situation. the ACA and PP are vital to America's greatness
killing babies is "vital to America's greatness." Sounds like something Hitler might've said abt killing Jews
PP doesn't kill babies.
that's a lie. They kill
No, they terminate unwanted pregnancies at the embryo stage.
then why is partial birth abortion even an issue?
It's not. They're A - incredibly rare and B - virtually never done voluntarily.
thank you Brian.
.@realDonaldTrump Jeez, man, your emotional growth truly was stunted at 8. So just be like a real 8 yr old & take ur ball & go home already
That's an insult to 8yr olds! Mine is DEFINITELY more mature and intelligent than Dumbledorf 
.@leehill77071 @realDonaldTrump You're right...my apologies to 8 yr olds everywhere!
the Trump Train stands with you & your message of Americans First 1776%! Decades we were put last.Fake news won't stop us!
the Trump Train stands with you & your message of Americans First 1776%!
Oh look, an inbred that uses the same insult over and over and over and ov...
The phrase you're looking for is "shit eating grin" why on earth would you try to replace a health act with a budget bill?
it was doomed to fail and everyone knew it except you. It's time for you to understand that social conservatism is doomed.
Social conservatism is not what this country was built upon. This is Washington, not the Vatican. #WhineyAssClown 
You are correct, CONSTITUTIONAL conservatism founded and built this country. Progressivism will fail.
why?
Progressivism is fascism in a new dress. History dictates it doesn't end well.
@LemonyLemmoyn Actually... historically, fascism has always come from the right of the political spectrum. #educateyourself
what the HELL is wrong with you?  GET THIS REPEALED NOW!  YOU are falling down on your promises!  I SUPPORTED YOU!
You do realize you are shouting for something that would hurt almost everyone you know, right?
These people prove that they don't care about anyone but themselves.Remember everything was ok as long as it didn't affect them until it did
.@realDonaldTrump Way to go pissing off the 40 Repubs who you can't wipe your ass in DC without. Keep tweeting... please.  #trump
Yes and let Bannon continue to "strong arm" them. That went over fantastically! Keep it up 45.
The Freedom Caucus actually has principles! When are you, @POTUS going to drain the swamp!!!!!???? I should have voted for HRC.
He is a jerk, I support the Freedom Caucus!
They supported a free market solution to repeal. I am a #Libertarian primarily.
In 50 years I have NEVER been as disappointed in a candidate I supported like I am right now with Trump...What a disaster!
Do you remember the mood of the country during Watergate?My ma says this is worse.Do you agree?Like to hear from ppl who lives through it.
I lived through it. This is much worse. Back then the GOP had courage & integrity.Gone
Ty for sharing. My ma always talked about Watergate like a demon spector over us. I'm scared of Trump and worried about the country.
Me too! This feels like brand new territory. Russia?!? And also the Mercers.
So true. I'm a Cold War baby and Russia is bad. Mean. The Mercers..agreed...
Are you tired of winning yet?
I'm just tired. I'll be able to sleep well after the impeachment.
.@realDonaldTrump you sound butt hurt. Maybe try at something for longer than 17 days before quitting.
DJT has. Ever had a deal he couldn't solve by walking away or threatening to sue. How's that working out for ya?
Only 6% of people "strongly approved" of the debacle that was "TrumpCare." So no, not only Democrats smiling: AMERICANS.
why we called the dems debacle Obamacare?
Trump demanded it pass, so, he owns it as much as RINO Ryan.
Bwahahaha name calling? Really? Not liberal at all Sparky be gone
People loving on Trump calling others liberals is rich!
this should help people smile across the country
Here's over 250 newspapers front covers from across the country the day after Trumpcare failed. Set to the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme 
That's "has," not "have." Freedom Caucus... has saved. Singular.
You promised us that we'd win so much, and we are! LOL
genuinely interested. What do you think you have won?
front row seat to the best comedy show in decades
Dude you got cucked so hard.
we are all smiling because it’s very clear you don’t know how to lead great people. You only know how to punish the vulnerable. Weak.
.@realDonaldTrump Ya know why democrats r smiling? Bc it's hugely gratifying to see u humiliated & a loser who's imploding. Got it? #trump
He's imploding now, but set to explode bigly.
And what a mess That will make! Worth buying a rainsuit for a front row spot! 
We're smiling for lots of reasons. Chief among them is you couldn't even rally your own party for a victory. SAD! #loser
\ Maybe his plan? silly liberals still got you finger stuck up your butt? pull it out and suck on it.... fell better?
Right. His plan was to lose and look like an idiot. Mission accomplished. And yes, I "fell" better. You talk so smart.
don't blame the bad deal, blame the bad deal maker #ArtOfTheDealNOT

Finally something we agree about!
15 kids at a nightclub were shot last night. A real leader would be... I dunnno... leading?
they weren't shot by a "muslim" so he can't incite fear... not worth addressing
Yasss, bitch! Drag your fellow Republicans!!
Must be really hard for you to not get what you want, crybaby. 
And don't forget the 24 million people you were gonna grab by the...ACA!
Supremely funny @iamsambee explains how stupid @realDonaldTrump #deepstate excuse is. You own these failures Donnie
[S]
Shouldn't you be teeing off right now?
no shit. Those things provide valuable services to the American people, and aren't just big tax breaks for the rich
.@realDonaldTrump Fuck you.
Heaven forbid they smile about the fact that people get to keep their healthcare. How DARE they.
it shouldn't be about Democrats r Republicans it should be about the people work with ... http://tmi.me/1fi77R 
.@realDonaldTrump You must fire #Bannon. U know that. U know he's the real one to blame. U know u want to dump him. Just do it. #trump
You say that like it's a bad thing.
.@realDonaldTrump hahahaha
You would be smiling and gloating if you got your way and millions of Americans were put in a worse spot. Don't hate.
you got flanked by moderates and conservatives bitch sit down lmao
And so a lot of people you would have killed get to live. Now on to your treason trial!
Really, Liberals love to create their own Soap Opera. The problem here is that they end up believing it!
It's not Liberals putting the Russian pieces together here. It's every American Intelligence agency and folks like John McCain
EVERY American Intelligence Agency has clearly said "No Evidence of Trump-Russian collusion to change the outcome of election".
That was Rep.  Nunes, intelligence committee chair, who many disagree with. FBI says they are still investigating
FBI Comey and the rest of Intelligence said NO evidence. FBI is investigating for pure political reasons.
.@realDonaldTrump Face it #Trump, @SpeakerRyan played you 4 the fool that u are. Ur an embarrassment to the office.
this was just round 1. A throwaway to survey the landscape.  Art of the deal. Stay tuned.
I KNOW ISN’T IT GREAT!!!!
Wasn't "Ocare" modeled after the Heritage healthcare plan?
No.  It was modeled partially after Mittens MA universal health mess
Which was modeled after the Heritage plan.
@StephenBannon This Tweet proves that someone in your inner circle is VERY out of touch with your voters...Maybe @Reince45
That tweet has me concerned.
The @freedomcaucus saved Trump from a humiliating defeat! Time to replace the advisors
No one is pushing the Pres agenda, which is what we voted for.
The Freedom Caucus has your back & helped you avoid disaster! If you would listen to them & not Ryan it would have passed!!
All of America is.  The Freedom Caucus is evil, but at least they're stupid.
36% Donny thats ur approval rating 64% want u gone #Resist #ReleaseYourTaxes #ImpeachTrump #Drumpf
@cut_the_crap_ec MAGA can't succeed, find a way to overcome these seditious obstacles. We elected you, they got a free ride
That's exactly correct! We can't afford Govt. involved in our Healthcare. Mere mention of Govt.price goes up!
.@realDonaldTrump Is The Freedom Carcass Starting To Reek?

We The People Need Repeal And Replace! Not Rehash!
idiot trump
i want to pick u up and pile drive u into a black hole
Thank God that TFC, Heritage & CFG protected u from failure 2 yrs in future! I'm a big fan of yours, but u should stop criticizing ur voters
We need to Just Replace Obama's nightmare then we can debate about the rest. Please Mr President, just have it REPEALED
killing our Senior Citizens for the right and ability to kill unborn Lives! Hell has a place for these soulless humans!
Dems are smiling because they have exterminated millions of minorities throughout the years & gotten away with it!
@orlandoandresm4 Yeah because working Americans should pay for the lazy Americans and immigrants to have health care.
Sure...And leave our vets to die on the streets.I owe illegals nothing,0,nada
I voted for you. That statement is garbage and you know it is. Paul Ryan is a liar. https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/08/14/the-big-money-behind-paul-ryans-political-career …
first time I've disagreed with the President (out of hundreds of things he's done)
is a disgrace to the @WhiteHouse. @potus is supposed to do right by ALL Americans! If you can do better than #ACA go for it
It's not just a few that feel this way, most Americans are seeing though lies Trump is trying to sell! SAD
god forbid you should do what the electorate want and is best for them. You're a representative not a god
ummmm...it's not just the Democrats in Washington that are smiling. Think bigger here.
you should quit while you're ahead so called deal maker
Planned parenthood is the scourge of American justice for unborn children. Murder is murder no matter how you "plan" it!
no, no one is smiling as long as you are in office #ImpeachTrump
you need to recognize who your base is! I supported and voted for you but you are really making me angry with this crap!
Why are you trusting Ryan? No one else does.....
Again, Liar in Chief, you missed the point. Dems are happy MILLIONS OF AMERICANS won't get healthcare cut. #Patriotism #CNN
Mr. Kline, I would like to thank you on behalf of my family for your service to and sacrifice for our country. Thank you! 
It was my dear pleasure to serve our amazing nation & protect what truly makes us great: our Constitution and ppl who love it.
You're a little tickle aren't you? Let Trump do his thing. That's why he got elected. He's not perfect and neither are we. MAGA
screw him he's attacking conservatives.
Bottom line, none of us is perfect except God. Remember that when bashing the only hope we have to MAGA. At least that's how I feel
@SpeakerRyan should have consulted w/ the Freedom Caucus b4 rolling out a bill that favors insurance cos.
Seems you've been stung by defeat. The ACA can help.
don't worry, you'll be hosting another cheesy game show in no time!
huge failure and broken promise by u. Sadly (for all Americans), first of many to come. Many of ur supporters regretting.
who are the members of the Freedom Caucus. Maybe need to vote these people out in 2018.
believe me...that's not why they're smiling...
it was a bad bill Obamacare light
I would much rather you concentrate on running the country at 2 in the morning instead of tweeting things aggravating peopl
We voted for #FullRepeal #CleanRepeal Replace can be phases 2,3,etc @freedomcacus did good!. @PRyan @HouseGop @SenateGop
.@POTUS you should work with the conservatives #FreedomCaucus instead of the establishment you ran against @PRyan against you in campaign
it was a bad bill! You should sit with the conservatives and let the free market work in health insurance
Trump wants to screw over disabled and impoverished American Citizens  #TrumpsHealthcareForTheRichOnly
, Defund that ungodly killing factory, planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood ex-workers spoke out with the truth of them killing many babies! Plain & Simple.
TERM LIMITS!
Ryan is in bed with insurance companies. Doesn't have your back!
I don't want my tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. This goes against my religious beliefs. Please do something.
Ryan does what the Coch brothers tell him to do it's that simple Mr Trump they also have more $$$ than you
the buck stops with you trump. Grow up, be a man. stop trying to find others to blame!
the biggest group of cry babies ever!
all this winning your doing rofl. Yet to see a win ha ha ha
Well if the government is still going to fund planned parenthood at least make em build their clinics at the border!
hope you're still laughing when I Collapse of healthcare happens
Something needs to be done #planparenthood. NEEDS TO BE DEFUNDED PERIOD. STOP LISTENING TO @SpeakerRyan BIGGEST RINO EVER!!
and probably the majority who didn't vote for trumpedcare
That's right! The American people want PP and the ACA. We don't want YOU! #Resign
Why do democrats hate Babies?????
Your #Gallup approval rating couldn't be any lower. SAD.
As president can you not pass a bill that no monies are passed to Planned Parenthood.
not good!
yesssss
did you ever think that the part of your popularity problem is 1- tweeting instead of working 2- attacking other people.
Well duh. Because that's awesome, that's why.
I suspect that some Democrats will be looking for a new job ... very soon!
Hi Mr President What is the main reason about the repeal AHA that Freedom Caucus refuge to get on board w/ you ?cut something down more?
All past presidents had bad press and they handled it with dignity. You quote Abe Lincoln try acting like him.
You Promised Tax Reform! Not Tax Cuts!
@elvisinoregon that just proves how evil they truly are!
Yes we are. Justice prevailed and someone for once did the right thing. For the American people. Not for $$ or themselves.
it's a shame that so few can hold all of us hostages!
democratic are Americans. It's time you saw us as one and stopped dividing the country.
So are a lot of Americans who will be able to keep their health insurance no thanks to you. #FailingTrumpAdministration
@Colombia4trump There was no reason to #bundle #PP and #Obamacare in the first place. #repealobamacare and #DefundPP!
however please leave planned parenthood alone they provide so much more than just abortions.
I voted for you to get rid of Obamacare not to rename it
they are also smiling at your new book "The Art of the Fail", #FakePresident #TrumpCareFails
why not - the rest of America is too
Yes ... and on behalf of 24 million Americans,"Thank You Sir".
hell yes they're smiling. Does that make you uncomfortable?
24 million americans are smiling with them.
your terrible Bill continued the mandated  tax forcing me to have insurance that I don't want &won't use and can't afford.
denial does nothing but prolongs the truth
Failed again. Sad. Cry Bigly to mama Bannon
Thanks Freedom Caucus! <3
Yes.  Yes, we are.  #TrumpDontCare
they are smiling looking at tour clownish management of things
Stunning piece of legislation. @SpeakerRyan couldn't live up to voters "Repeal" so we have to live with "Amend"? #RyanCare
Give 'em hell, Chief!!
-- Oh you poor thing. Imagine how many of your "dates" Planned Parenthood has "helped"
Pres Trump:  Go back and fix health care.  If you don't, everyone suffers.  Don't pit an artificial completion date.
time for Nancy Pelosi to retire like Obama was that great he did nothing and his life was sleazy no class Washington is BS
I don't think anyone will be smiling in DC until you move back to New York
You're just mad because we women hate you by the millions. And everybody knows why.
Planned Parenthood was created to exterminate black people. Ppl wake up to what Dems have done to us!!!!
And, a lot of people across the country are happy because they will still have health care.
Blame lies squarely on Paul Ryan's shoulders. He betrayed @POTUS & American ppl. Ryan is only loyal 2 himself & his backers
how the he'll did u manage to get in
don't give up ocare seriously needs to be revamped
God bless you Trump guys ! God bless America!
Thank goodness, poor women can get the health care they need. Not abortions bcz that isn't covered. Thanks PP.
Most of America is smiling because when you lose, it Makes America Great Again.
it didn't pass because you had a shitty bill
nahhh we smile every time you don't win and you haven't been winning lately ...so #TheResistance smiles a lot
Dimms would B laughing @GOP &calling U a fool 4 passing ACALite! U promised 2 REPEAL ACA. NO 2 ACALite & Ryan D Snake! 
DEMS will smile more once you are imprisoned for Treason and Nepotism.  Time to go is soon!
I think millions of Americans are smiling, now that they won't be losing their healthcare!
U r wrong to support Ryan's bill. Come on Prez! U r smarter than this..get out of the swamp. Repeal!
Everybody hates you.
I'm doing more of a nervous laugh than a smile. Nervous you may do some irreversible damage to USA before being impeached
Smiling! Were laughing you pathetic illegitimate lying Russias favorite golden shower traitor #resist #russiagate #impeach
Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP
for the next rally fund us at 
http://Usapray4trump.com   @March4Trump RT&Share
Dems r true definition of evil, they've brainwashed millions to believe their lies/deceptions while sticking knives in them
You saved #PlannedParenthood & #Obamacare by supporting a water down bill that kept funding the abortion industry. 
If you are serious about defunding #PlannedParenthood & repealing #Obamacare, ask #Congress 2 craft a better bill.  
Please DEFUND PP..it's just a chopping block for babies.  None that I know of even counsels women but only offers abortions
More appropriate on #FailureFriday
Compensating enough? @realDonaldTrump #tinyhandstrump #USPolitics #uspoli
Also the 3milion + who protested & flooded our representatives with calls to reject the plan!!
has a record low 36% approval rating.  Why so high lololol????
you certainly are not a "master negotiator."
keep up the great job.!!!!
You are a fake, a liar and the worst POTUS ever.
YES INDEED! Thank God for the ACA - sure beats that pile 'o  you proposed!!
#RepealAndReplace #BuildTheWall #POTUS #WeThePeople #DrainTheSwamp #AmericaFirst #LockHerUp #Flamingos4Trump #Breaking
In England, Cadburys , which was bought out by a American company has been removing Easter from the wording "Easter egg"
Apparently Cadburys sells halal certified chocolate as its milk from pre halal slaughtered cows. Never happened when they were a uk company
our insurance is through the roof. Job killer. We will remember them come voting day. Keep pushing
Only Republicans could miss a 2 inch putt.
The so called Freedom Caucus will cost us the House and Senate and possibly the White House in 2018. Unbelievable
It was bait and switch they only defunded for 1 year. REPEAL
But you have "tremendous respect" for women on Intl Women's Day right?
Feel Free To Defund PP, Leave ObamaCare Alone
You're a complete buffoon Demon45!
they're smiling because the #GOPe doesn't control the ppl who elected you or their representatives; remember the people
American are smiling that your train wreck of a Healthcare Bill didn't pass!
that's RINO Propaganda! / Don't LISTEN!/ Only Conservative VOICE/ RINOS! TRYING 2 DESTROY IT Reagan 2
The groups you mention are fighting for the conservatives who ELECTED you!
stop talking smack and give the freedom caucus a bill they can support and flush all the RINO's out!!!
Stop playing soft with the establishment. REPEAL!  You would do well to listen to Rand Paul.
