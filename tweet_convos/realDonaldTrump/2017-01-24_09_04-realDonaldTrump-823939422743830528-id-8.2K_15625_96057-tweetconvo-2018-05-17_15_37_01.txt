@TBNRfrags @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse did you really vote for trump? YOU WILL LOSW A SUBSCRIBER IF YOU DID.
Is there a problem wanting to support our President? o.O - I want him to make good choices for our country, not spite him.
even though I support one man will I not support another
No worries, I wouldn't want you to support someone just because I support them. I do however, support Donald J. Trump :)
look Preston I do however support the life I love though and I'm sure we all do

America is already great - and President Obama saved the auto industry!
I'm from Michigan and that is Bullshit. Google how Ford got out. And how Bush enacted the Bill for Obama to follow up on. Come on.
Is that bison taking on three fucking wolves? What a bad ass.
that is Trump killing Obama, Hillary and Pocahontas! So refreshing and inspiring, right?!!
Trolls be trolling.  Their hanging on your every word Mr POTUS.  Lol!!!
You're just giving us #alternativefacts aren't you?
@POTUS @WhiteHouse Boo!
together you will fully automate the manufacturing process and diminish more jobs than you are letting on?
AMERICA LOVES WINNING  Fake News MSM has been Rejected & r irrelevant. #MAGA  Hannity Breitbart Drudge IW
America loves you Mr. Trump
more people in that room than at your inauguration! SAD!
Dude! That tweet was sad.
why is Peter Russo there? (back right corner)
Did you ask them about automation and how that is the real threat to blue collar jobs?
You are undermining the will of the people by revisiting Keystone. There are other ways for you to create jobs.
Coordinating with a foreign power to boost the Kremlin's interest is treason.
 @realDonaldTrump
ha ha ha. You make me laugh!
Did you threaten them with punishments like with carrier?
Hopefully you'll help beat the record sales the auto industry saw under @BarackObama
tell Saab that
Together we will sell our souls to big business!
Make Amerika Automated
LIES
Women's rights are human rights. Music-American rights are human rights.
what rights do men have that women don't?
be ready for dakota backlash
Bring manufacturing back to America with your Trump brands! Why bully everyone else for doing what you're doing
Please get some good sleep and rest Mr President. A good nights rest is important!
Awesome!
Does twitter verify any hack POS now? Cause this feed is full of them.
Lobbyism at it's finest
I've been #MAGA ON EVERYTHING SINCE DAY ONE!  Awesome to see our great president does too!
Time 4 School Guidance Counselors 2 b retrained 2 present other options 2 college. 2 many "College Counselers"$
I'm not anti-college,but it's not 4 everyone.  Big loans with very few job prospects out there, is a waste of $
- To bad you have no clue of what's happening !
@POTUS @WhiteHouse Trying to rush through taking our rights while distracting us with bullshit.
@LindaSuhler @WhiteHouse As an automotive industry supplier, we are already seeing a NOTICEABLE uptick in future orders 
wow look at all of the diversity in that room!!! so proud
America is already great, thanks!
actually, America has been in Decline for a couple of decades and this man will turn it around
MAGA definition: strong military, strong economy.  Nothing about race
you said 50s and social progress, what else could that mean
Do you think that one day you will get the 'Nobel Hair Piece' prize?
Does he though?
No. YOU best quality.




. @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Tell Donald what you think on Tax day April 15!

Then why didn't he say this from day one if it were so cut and dry?
Did you demand larger back seats for easier p grabbin'?
old news bud... its pretty worn out by now. Get over it.
.@realDonaldTrump so many white men in that photo
Didn't realize White people are the dominant race in the U.S, my bad...
While that's nice, the date on that Inauguration photo you hung up is wrong.
Our household is watching your amazing progress on Fox News every day. God Bless you and thank you!

a room full of white guys and the odd woman - says it all really!
And dumbing down brainpower in the name of equal opportunity?  GTFOH!
but Trump, his cabinet, and in fact all his appointments are complete morons, so, ya know.
hmmmm. Cabinet fill of Billionaires means they're morons, please dear God make me one to
A person doesn't need to be smart to be rich.
Trump is living proof of that.
smart enough to win the election. lets see you do it bill nye.
Elections are not always won with brains.
Great meeting with automobile industry leaders at the @WhiteHouse this morning. Together, we will #MAGA! https://t.co/OX...
, Hello our Good President "Donald J. Trump". I felicitate with our leader and a role model, President Donald...
mostly men.  All white
keep bringing jobs back to our country thank you again mr. President period USA
your wife looks seriously abused bro, maybe you should try working on your marriage
his wife is gorgeous and gracious, are you kidding?
something super creepy is going on, i'm sorry that you're a loyalist to a sitting president!
please. N I voted for change. I am American and want us all moving forward together
.. and on and on.. thank god as a single dad I raised my kids to "think" for themselves
you don't know me dude don't go there
I don't think Paul Ryan is your friend.
Mr.President.  I know Scotland is not your most favourite place!  I've spent years in your country, the most fantastic country on earth!
The US can’t be run as a corporation. Corporations are centered around profits and stock value. Governments are centered around its citizens, defense, land, and welfare. Especially by a person with 4 bankruptcies under their belt
, Hello, our President Donald http://J.Trump.You 're a man of distinction which have transformed our community into envy
Release your tax returns, reveal details of your relationship with Putin, stop silencing Federal Agencies.
What woulda billionaire want from Russia?If you think foreign countries money,  you might be thinking of the Clintons. But that's ok?
You believe he was a billionaire? He is moving towards it now, he wasn't one before the election.
This is honestly the first I have heard of this.  Lol. He has been a Billionaire for decades. Where do you come up with this?
And why do you want his tax returns so bad. The average American isn't going to understand a Billionaires tax returns with 100 businesses.
He's convinced you that you're not smart enough. BS. He's hiding his true worth & conflicts.
He's not showing them most likelybecause he used bs laws to get out of paying taxes. Google hisnet worth.  First 5 sites will sayBillionaire
I know, his propaganda. If it were just BS laws, he would've released them after the election.
Jobs easily REPLACED with robotics. More unemployed. Get with the 21st century DONALD! #alternativefact #USA
Ever see the inside of an assembly plant?  Smh?
but in 20 years don't u think it'll be fundmentally different?
I'm sure in 20 years it will. By then, there will be more engineering, IT, and technicians tieing all the manufacturing systems together.
Keep the plants here and we will havethose jobs then.  Send them to Mexico and we will lose much more.
America was already great so I think what you mean is you are destroying America one law at a time
Just because you have one doesn’t mean you need to act like one.
Hey, you have something on your chin… no, the 3rd one down.
Did you remind them how the Obama administration saved the industry in US in 2009 against republican support???

thanks President Obama for saving the auto industry.

Looking good!
yea right... talk about mafia.... ur levying uncontrollable power to loot them is all.
where is @paul_elio and @elonmusk?

Detroit MagaCarta
Did they fly there private jets again to the meeting...
@POTUS @WhiteHouse - Tell Them @BarackObama says H, oh wait didnt you saved the auto industry #alternativefacts
again you are the man in charge to making this country great again!!!!
The only way I'd lay naked with you would be in a mass grave
Now get the workers to do their part and show up and stay in the j-o-b.
No you won't.  No discussion on vaporizing fuel.  We can be getting 200+ mpg right now but no talk of that.
Schumer is failing his party, the country and himself. President Trump is executing his forward thinking vision
Trump had to show off his tacky gold plated decorating obsession. Obama's & Trump's auto jobs hurt taxpayers.
Was the TV on in case you got bored?
The next step: motivating banks for favorable fixed interest rate loans at longer repayments for buying cars.
Wise words. For an idiot at least.
that's a lot of white guys
So far do good. A President that keeps his word, what a concept!
Sounds like trickle down again - which didn't work.
The auto industry that President Obama saved? Thanks Obama!!
we will moree job for your administration,good luck.
ask them to bring back 4g63s in the eclipse. Also touch on legalizing r34s please
easy to #maga when u give companies ridiculously high tax breaks. What will pay 4 schools, roads & hospitals?
maybe Mexico will pay for that.
@POTUS When will your shitty clothes be manufactured in the United States? #RossDressForLess #NoClass
Bannon sitting at the head of the table makes you look like a child. Sad!
thank you Obama for saving the auto industry when the Republicans refused
sir. About 99.9 percent of cars in Japan were made in Japan, it's disgusting
4 days into your administration and I am wishing more than ever that you had lost. President Obama already MAGA
Resistance is FUTILE!  #TrumpTrain #TrumpArmy #RedNationRising #AmericaFirst #Trump45
I'm sure they hate you just as much as the rest of the world!
Ya know, I wish you the best of luck Pres. Nothing but respect.
Thank you!!

All men of Faith have courage. They trust their God. We never apologize for God. Instead we let him demonstrate thru us. #MAGA #DJT45 
where was your advisor @elonmusk ???
America is GREAT already. Don't you mean you want to try to "Make America Better?"
Well done Mr.President! Your the best thing that happened to America in a long time.
select a new word "great" is overused with everything you do! Seriously it is NOT all great
STOP THE GAGGING!!!
What about health care? ACOs? Can you preserve nursing jobs with ACOs if you repeal the ACA?
You are doing a great job.
Don't you realize that sending out things under your own name means you're forgoing the title of @POTUS for your comms?
INCREDIBLE Mr.President God bless you
GREAT JOBS CONGRATULATIONS MANS...
Release Your Taxes!!
You are not doing anything but damaging this country and hurting American citizens. You are an embarrassment.
@POTUS @WhiteHouse stop exaggerating and give others a chance to speak,it's not all about you,Donald!!!

thanks
#PresidentTrump helps GM CEO to her seat... Whattay Mysogynist! #TuesdayMotivation
I live in southcentral missouri,on the state line.I would love to see more jobs here. Too many on the dole
@POTUS @WhiteHouse As always, the diversity pictured here is stunning. 
#FRAUDPRESIDENT
as long as bailouts aren't given again. If they can't run their companies like a boss then F them

Thanks to Obama for rescuing auto industry back in 2008_ 2009.!
everything is great in your book
You must be the arithmetic man; you add trouble, subtract pleasure, divide attention, and multiply ignorance.
I support you mostly except for pipeline. Indian spirits may not be very inviting.
