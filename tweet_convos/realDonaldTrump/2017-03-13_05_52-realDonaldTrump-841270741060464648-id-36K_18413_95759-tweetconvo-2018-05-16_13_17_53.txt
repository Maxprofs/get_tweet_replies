Maybe you should practice what you’re preaching here. You have been just as rude and nasty. What do you expect?
Thats what happened to the pass BBC before they changed most of their staffs to restart the company but nobody have interest in them again. My holy bible tells me that whoever that establishes his house on lies must never Stand !
yasss donald yasss
Yes, they are very rude to them and I’m glad you pointed it out
Dear Sir
#donaldtrumphasamicropenis
GFY
It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!...

Not when they see the corruption in Obama's administration!                           #ReleaseTheMemo
Wow, u know nothing about ur job. They're not 'YOUR' representatives; They're OUR representatives!  He is POTUS? Simply unbelievable!
#releasethememo
Younate talking about being nice? You???? Hahhahhahhaha
thank you #maga #unite #bestpresidentever
They shook the MSM family tree and a bunch of nuts fell out!  Keep up the good work, you're doing great President Trump. Haters gonna hate.
He's the President of the United States in case you missed the election  No matter who you voted for you should hope the president succeeds. He's not trying to go to war with other nations. NK has threatened our country several times. Do you expect our president to do nothing?
Honestly, I hope he fails before he starts ww3
Please resign
#ReleaseTheMemoNow
"I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own cock."  Like that kind of nice?  That kind of rude? #WorstPresidentEver

Has anyone out there kept up to date on what is happening with Russia and the Trumps?  If it wasn't for the Media we would never no.
There is more than one station.  Not all people forget to tell the truth.  It is so easy to forget until your caught.
#ReleaseTheMemo
@KellyannePolls A groper like you telling people to be nice? You're such a joke that has the world laughing.
Oh now that's rich!!!!  You of all people talking about rudeness. What's next?  Morality lessons?
@Maryjohale3 definition of how government is supposed to work! Resign now, please!!!! #TrumpImpeachmentParty
#ReleaseTheMemo
@Maryjohale3 Your representatives? You REALLY do think they're supposed to work for you! You don't even have a "working"
When you and your representatives have the maturity of a toddler and the kindness of a bully it's hard to find the patience but I'll try :)
#releasethememo
No.
Just n-o.
You make a big deal of the fact that you already did more than Obama, but all that you'h' done is piss off our friends.
Oh, and don't forget, you are the most sexist person I've ever heard of.
Your friends are getting called out as well?
@Machukah Dennis bii in Kenya
If you're about to judge rudeness, first look in the mirror!   #dumpGOP2018
We love you mr president, you are doing good things for this country.
Right! Let me suggest you lead by example.
#releasethememo
 #BigBabyTrump you're such a joke!!
It's amazing to me you are celebrating passing a bill designed to hurt and ultimately kill millions of hardworking Americans.
What's amazing is how rude you - the leader of this great country - are. #suchanembarrassment #dumptrump
Albany NPR called you a liar today for no coverage of the preexisting condition in the healthcare revision. Watch for Ryan. Stay safe.
People get rude when someone lies to their face.  Try honesty, or at least learn to lie better than a three-year-old.
@mcolfer02
The media is just egnoring all of us and that,s just alarming to me like they know something, same for the Democrats the narrative.?
The media has been pretty friendly considering what an incompetent, greedy, ass you've been. "Run the country" didn't mean into the ground.
I believe we can say the same for you, you delusional man-baby. Stop trying to start wars and imagining like you can govern the country.
You first
You are the poster child for rude, obnoxious people
Rude people Suck!
it's not just our President. Media bullying is at an all time high. Dividing, causing death, hate, pain, making us unsafe.
YOU are telling us to be "nice"! You're such scum-not fit to lick our boots - let alone tell us what to do! #Trumprussia
It's amazing that you would say you love #Wikileaks but then go after its publisher. #EarthDay #marchforscience #pizzagate #Coachella
I bet you choked on the word nice...
You're the best President in my Lifetime.I do not watch MSM, FOX biz only.America needs a Trump Network to get the real truth out.
I am so proud you are my President and You are not Fearful of the jib jab crap, fake news, and social media! You are the real deal!
Some are both mean and despicable.  Some are also criminals just like you. #trumprussia.  #russiagate #resist #trumpcolluded
Save your threats.  You'll need them in jail.
Are you triggered snowflake??
Appointing Cabinet Members that are an insult to America...
Hey, you've got a KC fan and supporter here! She's the lady we all wish was our mom,aunt,boss, teacher,etc.
Says the man who based his entire campaign and Presidency on being a total asshole and inspiring others to do the same.
they learn from you and you bully pulpit tablescare turned and you can't stand it. Dictator in Chief!
I feel yeah great working men like ourselves don't deserve treatment like this. @Olivia69739162
I'd even be ok with "polite" or "respectful"... but that would be expecting too much from these partisan clowns.
Doing a Great Job...
how rude can you be to a hulk ?
President Trump,  keep doing the right thing and God will bless your path.
Wow, people can be cruel.  Most would not say these things if they had to answer for it.  Easy to hide and tweet.

Did you like #March4Trump ?
We need to raise $3,000+ ASAP

Barf.... never!!!!!!
@smokesangel they get...what they put out!

What's amazing is despite mocking the disabled, grabbing women, and colluding with Russians, you're still somehow in office. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/841270741060464648 …
Excellent words of advice you should give yourself.
Because your representatives are working hard at hurting us they are being treated rudely.   What else would you expect to happen??
every day you sound more and more idiotic.
it's called politics. It's their job. Put your big boy pants in.
I agree
It is the media's obligation to report the facts, not to "be nice" and soothe your huge ego, Trump.
sorry sir
thank you sit
You reap what you sow.
Be honest and transparent and they wouldn't have to hound your people.
Watch their faces when they interview!   Cold, mean spirited and vicious!  Watch Savannah, Matt or Chuck..going for blood one bite at a time
You... telling others to be nice?! That's hilarious!
This guy does not read these tweets.He dont give a crap about our nation he only cares about lining his pockets! Dump trump
@potus you are trying to intimidate media using "nice" as a veiled threat. Your fear that they are close to the truth is 100% transparent.
OR you could worry about our COUNTRY instead of your Rep's "feelings"... you surely didn't care about the feelings of the women you ASSULTED
Ur working wRYAN.remember what he said about u & how he treated you. not your friend. He will SCREW US over. Ur the swamp side aligned w/him

18It's amazing that you think corps will put responsibility above profit when you don't/you think pipelines are safe #presidentstupid
17It's amazing that it's the 21st century & the head of the EPA has no scientific background whatsoever he's just another lawyer #luddites
16It's amazing that you& Congress have a policy mtg  on woman's health w/out a woman in the room/how few know anything about female anatomy
16It's amazing SecHHS Price graduated med school let alone has a license. Antivaxer/zygotes have feet/fertilized egg=pregnancy #baddoctor

1What's amazing is that you appointed a Sec of Ed that thinks intelligent design is a science/an oil tycoon as a SOS/a forgein agent for NSA
Honest question to Trump supporters. How do you not consider him a "snowflake" when he complains the media is mean to him all the time?
I don't care what the media or anyone says I'm proud of our President
stop tweeting
maybe you should take your own advice. How about that? 
T#%*p = Dr. Evil Ivaka = Mini T#%*p
don't you have more important things to do like screw over an entire country...I mean make America great again
nice???? Like how you treated the leaders of Japan and Germany?
If you were a joke -you'd be laughable. But -life's circumstances make you more pathetic than laughable. God help us all.
you've got to be kidding
take your own advice! You are pissing off enemies and allies!
Be nice, you will do much better!
the democrats clam to go high. Their new high is their new low.
Great job!!  Don't let them get you down. Waited long time for your lelasweship
As nice as you? Did they call them sick felons undermining our sacred institutions?
We would be nicer if you were working for us, not your friends who are just as rich as you. You're FAKE NEWS!
I mean that's wild cuz like they'd be nice if like they were doing a good job or anything
same goes to you!!!
Donald it seems most Americans realize what you are and it's definitely not Presidential. And not a deal maker. A fool.
You make Tricky Dick Nixon look good compared to Putin puppet Donald J Trumpsky.
Can I reserve seats for the Impeachment?
You have a couple of fools representing you, Conway and Spicer. But you're impossible to defend.
@KellyannePolls the paragon of niceness?
you're the rude one. Didn't even want to give a handshake to a woman.
Emo Trump. You would think all that tanning you do would thicken that hide of yours #thinskinned #Unfit #resign
you're a lot of crap

You should take your own advice. Be nice. You MIGHT do much better.
@KellyannePolls that's an alternative fact lmao
They're not nice if they disagree with you?   Get rid of Steve Bannon with HIS fake news and conspiracy theories.
i bet if you took your own advice there that would solve everything.
We do not suffer fools gladly...
