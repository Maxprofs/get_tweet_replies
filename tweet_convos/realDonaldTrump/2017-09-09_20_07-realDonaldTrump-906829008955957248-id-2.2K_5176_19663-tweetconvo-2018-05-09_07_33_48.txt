Unnatural Disaster

SS Hurricane Trump

Harvey - Trump pardons Arpaio
Irma - Trump rescinds #DACA
@DC_Resister_Bee
What a waste of time this paid, evil tongued SOROS Disciple is.

After the storm passes, will @realDonaldTrump open Mar-A-Lago for those seeking shelter? Doubtful!
NO!
Congratulations meet the second lady nominee for 2025 good brother Graham Cassidy please.

Attention attention first responders safety first
 always remember safety first if you can't help them what good are you safety first

The historical significance. 5 of 6 living presidents; Trump wasn't invited to participate. That speaks volumes!! Don's reputation,...EVIL.
To be fair … it was adults only.

#Hurricane #Irma is not related to global #warming. President Trump says. #Trump supporters do not run away! Hurricane is a media animation!
Mr Donald Trump, you are champion, you are winner, your approach is best for http://USA.you  can doJaved Malik wrote 500 articles
@realDonaldTrump The School RSO at #GulfCoastHighSchool, told all volunteers that Naples doesn't want any help and to go home! Is this true?
@jeaninepirro has obviously had some cosmetic surgery.
"Hurricane Force Winds" = Gusts
= Militant climate change NONSENSE for "was NOT a hurricane"
Hurricane is DEFINED ONLY by sustained winds.
Thanks for the weather update we really neeedit from you Danny boy make America great again leap on this disaster so we can avoid the 1 D.C.

Gee, that is more shelters opened than polling places closed. SO....it is possible to OPEN more polling places just like shelters!
Din’t trust fox news!
Including Mar-a-Lago? Oh wait that would require an owner is a good person.
Hello Mr President, why you don't want to talk of Biafra the Nigerian military are killing us
Neighborhoods between Poinciana and Haines City Florida are still without electricity where the heat and humidity are sweltering.
Was Mar-a-lago a shelter?  Didn't think so. Where's the $$$$$ he said he would donate? #DeportMelania #JailFirstCrimeFamily
#Islamic shelters
Made it through Irma, our first hurricane! Was not fun!Big thanks to Ms.Brown of Brown Farms for FreeSandbags! W/o power for 42 hours...
...kudos to KUA & the hardworking utility workers! Thank you!!
THANKS for the coverage of Irma @HARRISFAULKNER and @ShepNewsTeam . Lots of good local detail from folks who know the state well. 
I remember meeting Harris Faulkner when she had a soul. Before she sold out to faux news.
So you've stopped peddling fake pictures but you're still peddling fake news organizations.  I guess that's improvement.

I told u so: Our kids #SoldOut

Look at all the trolls. The MSM isn't talking about Trump and the trolls are starving!
Did you open Mara lago for the evacuees?? Yeah, didn't think so. You're nothing but hot wind.

What Happened?
Donald Trump Happened!…

Ukrainian oligarch with ties to Trump campaign could be extradited to Chicago courtroom "within weeks," lawyer says http://trib.in/2vQHfno

Hopefully, your house in Florida is strong enough to withstand IRMA, as you are strong enough to handle defamation form left field flakes

What's more shocking than a Russian acknowledging effective meddling is that some among us will continue to deny it. https://www.axios.com/russian-politician-says-russia-stole-u-s-presidency-on-live-tv-2484056561.html …
@realDonaldTrump why are you retweeting a weather announcement from 2 days ago Donnie?

Our vulnerabilities r not strengthened by a wall, but by protecting access to power, food, water & shelter when we have catastrophic events
We need innovative solutions to creating a power grid that isn't blown apart by wind and floods; too much depends on power.
It's time to recognize our vulnerability to global warming & invest in resilience & infrastructure, informed by best science, not "beliefs"

Umm you sure about that? You often retweet fake news. #ImpeachTrumpNow

Lesson for Republicans who constantly complain about regulations (VIDEO) 
And not one of those shelters was Trump resort, so much for Americans helping Americans.

Why not use Trump properties to help. We rvalready paying him for them. What do u think Scab?
Are you opening mar-a-logo for hurricane victims?
You and your wife are beautiful people

How many rooms did you say you have in mar a lago? I'm sure you could accommodate some of the hurricane victims.As a good Christian u should
Yup, you could shelter a lot of people in there.

How are things going at the Miami airport?
Who are you,another millionaire who needed a job & kissed donald's as____ to get the job?

The Eye literally went right over our home in Lakeland. We played UNO for a couple of hours waiting, listening, and praying for protection.

Let's not forget Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands either! They are OURS too! Citizens are hurting there as well. STEP UP or GET OUT!
How about a Trump property?

You sure you don't mean Mexico City?

Too bad that the WH social media is spreading fake news during the storm pretending to be at Miami airport, how pathetic can your admin get?
