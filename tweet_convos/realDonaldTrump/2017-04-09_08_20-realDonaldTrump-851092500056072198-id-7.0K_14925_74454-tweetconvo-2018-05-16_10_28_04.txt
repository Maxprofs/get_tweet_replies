"I'm the socialist party & I have no idea what socialism is"
We know EXACTLY what it is. A class-free stateless leaderless moneyless society; production to meet needs, and free access to what you need.
The former Soviet Union? China? North Korea?
Google "state capitalism". That's what they had/have. A profit-driven economy with an asset-owning elite, waged work, markets, money etc.
It has leftwing state-run capitalism. Not socialism. Educate yourself please.

You're surprised this guy doesn't make good decisions? I mean I'm shocked, totally flabbergasted. *sarcasm*

@MollyJongFast @realDonaldTrump
The great thing about social media is you can block the negative aholes Trump is MY president
You can have him until he's impeached. Of course this means you love Russia because trump is putin's puppet.
Didn't Putin's puppet just attack Putin's ally?


You are so confused... wake up, Trump is your president like it or not. #MAGA

Trump doesn't care about you, the real people of America. He says he does, but that is just another lie. His actions prove otherwise.
He's immune. Trump's always only surrounded himself with admirers & yes people. I think most of them use him right back.
Amazed you managed to fire off a couple tweets between holes. So much for "I will never golf again". #Fraud

To accompany EVERY Trump tweet:
But it could be worse: Trump could be ‘presidenting’…
Well, Trump is a fool, Hannity is a liar, and Tump voters should be ridiculed HOURLY for their approval of his incompetence...

Too bad you just can't enjoy the good that he's doing!
No, we can't. Can you explain what that is exactly?
I don't insult, but if you read this & at the very least make you stop for a sec and think, then I am encouraged. https://www.hermancain.com/trump-accomplishments-vs-media-crap …
These are terrible things
Wow that list is not good. I can list soo many things wrong with almost all those

•@MollyJongFast @realDonaldTrump
Why do you only tweet when Christians are attacked?
That's a fact !!#
But....America is not a one religion dominant country, thanks to the founders.
They musta known Evangelicals would Jesus-Up for Trump…

Tiffany needs a stun gun and mace.
So sad to see you bomb broken airplanes in Syria.
How I know you're an idiot....Reagan was the 40th president...... this his how I know
Ah I see. Terrorism only warrants a response from you when it involves Christians. I get it.

Doesn't take much these days to trigger Republican't snowflakes.
I'm not concerned with what he tweeted as much as he has twitter diarrhea
Nice.
Sure you don't want to send some missiles over just to get your dick hard?
They isn't what gets his dick hard…

@avitable @realDonaldTrump
LOL@Tiffany
It seems that Tiffany's the only smart Trump.
just more left zombie brainwashing tactics, how much lower can the left go. The future will show.
Why do you hate black people? Go drink some drain cleaner.
I hope you're asking that of DJT!
I'm asking that of @catizme, who replied to all of us. ;)

Except for, you know, more than 550 airstrikes Obama ordered in two terms. But sure. Cool meme bro! You did such a nice job reposting it.
Yet the air strikes that Obama sent weren't bashed by a bunch of snowflakes who just have their panties in a wad 
he looks like a president unlike obama the knee bender

I supported you until you gave NASA money,  now I know you're just another traitor.
NASA is what put you over the edge?

If only there could've been signs that he was untrustworthy to begin with...
The countries that support terrorism in the Middle East are
Qatar and Turkey
What's your next move after Operation Pothole? You're going to tell Russia so you might as well tell us too.
Maybe save your anti trump opinions for another tweet? His tweet is in reference to 28 people blown apart during a mass in church
Not every tweet from him has to be met by opposition. Pick your moments

...like Bowling Green and Saturday Night Live!  Such tough battles!



Ummmm I would think about who is the snowflake here.  Drumpf people are so triggered! LOLOL

Mr trump, is their any truth to the information that the us will send 120,000 troops to Syria?
The troops need to be brought home from the Middle East not expanded the us and the world has been in war since 01
Bring the troops home from Afghanistan Iraq and Syria don't add to more veterans already suffering hardships of homelessness medical
Conditions and PTSD help them with new healing technologies and cures
But you're playing golf
You got that right…

@mrsharma @realDonaldTrump
We love what you are doing for the WORLD!
Isn't he playing golf right now?
Yes, they love it when he plays golf all the time. They call it "multi-tasking".
Or 'multi-costing" because it cost so fucking much
Somehow suddenly nobody cares about that anymore. They look the other way and talk about how the leftist "elites" are ruining the country.
The rage against Christians has just begun. Thanks for protecting Americans..
I don't have time for your crazy.
I have faith in you Mr. President!!

I think its in flakewood. I meant Lakewood
Still waiting for you to condemn the attack on Quebec City mosque back in January. #CluelessCheeto
Why would he condemn something that he doesn't care about?
he's "for" the attacks on mosques.  and those on indians who are beaten by cleetus who think all light brown skinned ppl are muslims.


Worst president
I KNOW - I hated paying under $2/gallon for gas and having job/insurance, security. Sure am glad those days are behind us!
Since when did any of those things your spewing about happen? Just cuz he promised it doesn't make it so..Jesus take the wheel...
No changes to healthcare,no job opportunities, except ones Obama created & we're still buying oil from other countries. Where ya been Ma?
He had to do something… 

@ChemTrlAntifa @realDonaldTrump
another reminder to not help Islamists in Syria
Butcher Assad is a terrorist and so are all that support him.
yeah, supporting moderate rebels is supporting al nusra and al qaeda. isis rejoiced trump's attack
It's like you work for and support the 9/11 guys. Stockholm syndrome. Sad for USA!
how's the weather in Moscow? still working on $400 a month?
I'm not Russian lol.
many trolls in Macedonia i hear
What can you do...Bringing global empires to it's knees since Alexander the great. 
Do Not continue the devastating policy of Obama and Hillary!The people voted for you to put end in the war against Syria & begin cooperation
With Russia! You're making horrific decisions right now! Iran is not the enemy. Iran must be ally in fighting terrorism! You're serving the+
Interests of the butchers and wahhabists like Saudi Arabia! Stop it now before it's too late!!! Do Not destroy the world!
Prayers for Egypt.

#Burnt is the shame of a nation.
I'm sorry but you have a typo

#Trump is the shame of our nation
Unfortunately you've been mislead. The hope for any possible salvation of the nation rests with @POTUS as he fixes the trash left from 8 yrs
For example: your fucking president thinks global warming is fake.
Yes it is Mr. President ! We have alot of work to do to set things right again !!!
And then there's this

What no attack by the US? 
Oh I forgot don't you have bussines interests in Egypt
As a Muslim, I consider ISIS a terrorist group! They dont represent my religion. All our thoughts & prayers with people of Egypt #cdnpoli
You're our Jesus!! God, I love you.
don't wanna spoil it!
what a horrible thing to say about my Lord and Savior! I will be praying for your soul!
thanks!!!!!!
You bombed both sides of a civil war in Syria.
And you still make no move to designate the Muslim Brotherhood & its many subsidiaries as terrorist organizations?  How many more deaths?
the world will never do cz MB are the tools to play games and perform plans
True, they have infiltrated so many Western govts, they pretend to be moderates while acting to subvert their hosts & sponsoring terrorism.

...no mention of the terrorist attack on US soil? Is it because of his belief? 
The San Bernardino shooter, who killed a young child and his wife, has been identified as a pastor. - http://go.shr.lc/2oSLjUl 
Any loss of life by another is incredibly sad let alone multiple lives...
...this pastor was clearly a terrorist but isn't labelled one.
..to @realDonaldTrump 
There is no need to fear.
America* Loves you. if you preside in Love
America* hates you.. the more you spread fear
So I think we should start a real walking dead just saying
you said to president Assad : if u gas a baby or drop a borrel bomb onto innocent people,u will see response from us!!!!
the war in Yemen has so far killed 10.000 people half of them civilians#U.S has been providing#support#S.A
show us respond
Let Egypt take care their problem. Let Syria take care their problem too. what happened in Syria is a political dirty games of UAE Kings
You know what's Sad? You are! Weak and a lier! Stop going to FLA to do US business! #golftrips #tacky

Hailey didn't u support him a couple months ago tho 
Retweet em
SHOCKED you didn't bomb them to send a message of not tolerating violence in their own country. Oh wait you have business dealings in Egypt.

アメリカの強硬姿勢を支持します。
And The US people strongly condemn the terrorist attack on America by the selfish Corrupt Dictator Trump. U know Fred would be ashamed of u!
It will continue until the heathens calling themselves Jew-ish are removed, and real Israelites/Blacks return by the hand of Yah/God.
http://linkis.com/bipartisanreport.com/8xPx9 … This would mean YOU & PUTIN were behind those gas attacks!
Sounds about right to me.  #VerifyAllFactsBeforeTrust
@realDonaldTrump  A Wharton education? How about writing: "The United States of America condemns the terrorist attacks in Egypt!
Please stop saying and writing words like "very" "many" and "Strongly" Adverbs should be used sparingly. Sheesh!
Bervand Gruggen : Stupid Education ...
You do not speak for an entire country. Stop acting like it.
First and Foremost, why are you tweeting about this and not doing anything about it. These are the types of things that make me dislike you.
I swear to fucking god, if he actually does something about it everyone gets pissed. But if he doesn't, he is such a bad guy.
Terrorism in all countries all over the world mr. Presedent ... God bless u all to fight those devils
Mr. President.  You only have three trustworthy allies in the Middle East theater. Israel, Russia and Egypt. Trust nobody else. NOT CIA.
We all know it was staged - false flag !! So why pretend that its something else/ Why??
And no comment on the school shooting...but please be sure to get your golf game in!
Great!! Thanks to Obama's 100 million.. now President Trump cleaning up their mess!!

This is worse attack in years, u realize how brave they r?! Allie with Russia & Assad.  Assad protects Christians. How can u ignore this??
