As long as it doesn't interfere with my golfing weekends.
Good
We know our military would have been there sooner had the so-called CIC cared about those Americans!
You know it. I can't even say his name. Golfing again. Should be on his way to Puerto Rico now.
Why don't you all volunteer to go?
I don't have the $$ and I'm not the President. .. See... there is a difference. smh
What a mess...poor folks going through all this, 3 hurricanes. awful, thank you Mr. President and all the military who left family to help
You are missing the point. The STORM was 10 DAYS AGO! People have been stranded. Children hungry, no water, no milk for babies, no gasoline
So if you #tRUmp think you have done a great job on Puerto Rico & the Virgin Islands that would be alternative facts We know you haven't Sad
Bs you people act like you know what's going on.
(1) Let's neutralize Operation Katrina, the disinformation blitz that the press and the Democrats are running.

(1) Okay. First we have the video of the Puerto Rican truckers' union confirming that they're on strike.

Trump and FEMA even had supplies there before the Storm ffs. Hmm

Get me Donald Trump
"a day late and a dollar short" describes your entire pResidency... #FakePresident #traitor #throwthebumout
Where are all the allied countries that we always help in a disaster?
Trump admin hasn't accepted their help.
Better LATE then Never, but at least its happening now, but should of already been going on 7 days ago, and could of been except TRUMP!!
You realize Puerto Rico's on an island… And it takes time to get things together… Even the airport they had to send people to clear it
It's surrounded by big water. LOL
Glad to see this, but why is St. Croix not receiving post Hurricane Maria news coverage like Puerto Rico?
Need SEA-BEES sent to rebuild. @SeabeeCenter
The Fed is actively working to help #PuertoRico. They have been there after #IRMA. Do not trust media that disregards #Maria rescue efforts.
Gov said it wasn’t a good experience. Made Potts mad. Smdh. DOD up against unpassable roads, lack of delivery drivers and trucks, you name
It, they’re struggling to overcome it. Hooray for DOD! They are heroes and amazing! We love you! Thank you! Not their fault potus was slow
To get more going on this. Let’s give them their due! This isn’t another Vietnam where our heroes won’t get our support and love!!
While I read those who bash the incredible response the haters, I appreciate all our President is doing.  The USA response has been great!
#WorstPresidentEver
Good you know it’s an island with big water round it and a BIG Ocean!!
Ocean water. 
We know the fake news is blowing smoke again. Some people think you can wave a magic wand and instantly fix hurricane destruction.

Yes BOYCOTT until they hire Kaepernick
This is an update.  This is not the first aid to arrive.  Good grief, do y'all believe everything the MSM tells you?
No, but I believe the mayor of San Jaun.
The Mayor of San Juan doesn't have the whole picture either.  Governor Rosselló, however says that @POTUS is doing the best job possible.
He's lying. Im from here, im in PR NOW and things are not good or progressing. The governor is ass kissing Trump.
I think you're just hating on Trump so badly, you refuse to see that he's doing everything that can be done.
& idk if the best he can do is send 5k military men to help 3.5 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS then he's not a smart or good president at all
He's the BEST we've had in a decade.
Hahahahahahaha ok now youre fucking insane just like he is. The best in decades  im done here bc obviously you're a lost cause. Good day
The airlines want cash, cash is scarce. Limited commercial flights. Have a little heart!
……send it & when it can get through. It's dire, there's no water, gas, or electric. You called me out, so, what are YOU doing to help?
……standing, up to her waist in flood waters while checking for ppl? She's always got a cap on, dirty hair? Maybe? In your mind because she……
It's not trumps fault if PR can't organize their truck drivers
But it's the responsibility of FR to do what needs to be done, on orders from the CiC. There's been a lag there, not just with trucks.
Keep digging, @DeptofDefense: you've nearly reached Vietnam era credibility loss.
THREE WEEKS AGO we knew this coming. Unforgivable delay.
On Sept 20th...
Come on Paul, don't ruin their fun with trivial things like facts.
You're right. News and social media is no place to get informed.

Yes. A fucking week late.
They were already coordinating operations before the storm.
My point is why was it so little until now.? Why was the Jones Act waived only 2 days ago? Why is SJ mayor saying these things?
This is dated Sep. 21 from FEMA   https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/21/hurricane-maria-response-and-relief-operations-underway …
Im not arguing some things were done. I am questioning the logistics, red tape, and the lack of full effort.
"Lack of full effort" Tell that to the military personnel on the ground.
What effort is San Juan seeing. Why are 70% of their hospitals not working. You want pick one part of my statement instead of it all.
This video is using stock footage and is very misleading.
Some ppl are saying it's video of Haiti. Sad.
Now We Turn From Darkness Into Light We Were Sick And Now We Are Healed We Were Dead And Now We Thrive To Life Eternal Given By Jesus Christ
They were nearby like St. Thomas and USVI. Real relief efforts only begun in the last few 2-3 days for PR
We know your there and we appreciate you. People of PR need to help themselves. It’s their paradise. Not mine.
They are US citizens. Hope someday you dont need help.
They are getting help. No one wishes they don’t. It’s the critical political bs. Stop the croc tears.
Your statement “help themselves, it’s their paradise. Not mine”
Btw David, when I have needed help,  I was told No. Anyways, thanks for the critiques, have a nice day.
Sorry you were told no. If you need something in future DM me. We aren’t close but my church is good about mobilizing.
Sorry, I just had a chance to read this.  Thanks for straightening that picture out also. Your right and I think that is why he gets so
much grief. He won’t change, he is one of those people that all you can do is roll your eyes. He was still a better pick than
Where is Comfort? How come she's not at port in PR yet?
She just left.  A week late
Exactly. Trump is incompetent! A prepared leader would have had it stocked and ready to go day of Hurricane!
You know there was more than one hurricane right. Resources probably spread thin. Any other President would be in the exact same situation
Actually they wouldn't. There was one who was always criticized for being overprepared. Hmm, wonder if maybe that IS what we want in POTUS
Give me a break. Who was this 'one' and when did he have to respond to an event like the current one.
Wow how your sexist world assumes a he.
There have only been male presidents. And that's what We're talking about. How is that sexist?
Thank God for the all the people that are there to help. Can we delete the delay caused by Trump's bad leadership that left us to die?
Good job
They are doing a great job despite the lack of leadership from out so-called president. Your hateful tweets solve nothing.
Good job. Thank you.

@pewdrdad @fema No one is talking about the Virgin Islands...too many white people?
@realDonaldTrump @fema too bad we needed to see this over a week ago, feet drag
Go DLA

So Lebron and all the other athletes are saying Trumps words and actions are divisive.  To dumb to see the hypocrisy.
#NFLBoycott #usa #nfl 
Amazing job. More should have been deployed faster.
REAL leaders don’t NEED to post endless phony claims of praise for just doing the job they were hired to do! Obviously YOU DO!
Comfort ship left Wednesday or Thursday 7-9days after storm why not day after storm
This ships must be lost

The Russia scandal is complicated, so we thought we would do what every other crime investigator does these days and make one of these: 
Great job Mr. President. Keep it up “We the American people and veterans got you covered “   We are one UNITED. GOD bless America.
Great NEWS! Hoping PR discloses this!
These islands will recover but it will take time. News media needs to be supporters of relief efforts not use it to attack President Trump.
Unbelievable damage to the whole island of Puerto Rico and yet fake news would have you believe there is magic wand can be waved to fix mess
PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE; OH SO VERY BEAUTIFUL 
The prediction is for storms to continue to get worse. #ClimateChangeIsReal
*Nice video public relations from ALL THREE HURRICANES.* THANK-YOU FOR FINALLY SENDING Hospital ship "Comfort" after a WEEK of pleading! 
SO MUCH TO GAIN !!!  Don't stay the same! Look at Chicago-people are dying & it's not from a HURRICANE-but IL ldrs won't choose GOOD change?
THEY ARE BEGGING FOR HELP FROM CRIMINAL ELEMENTS - wow - that's a mess - the State where unionized EDU began under Clinton wolf - ENGULFED !
Hmmm, looks like your sentence originally started with "evidence", you forgot to edit the rest of the sentence. As written makes no sense.
Trump making PR great again. @ChrisCuomo @andersoncooper and #FakenewsCNN won't show this video. @realDonaldTrump
Try this one instead:
Harrowing drone footage shows a neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in aftermath of Hurricane Maria. "Ghost town covered in sewage water" 

BRAVO USA! VIVA PUERTO RICO!
How 'bout St maarten? They also got the big 5 against them.

Thank you all for that you do!  #americanproud @usairforce @USArmy @USNavy @USMarineCorps @NationalGuard  @USCG 
So basically the only reason Trump is doing anything at all is so he can win a Twitter argument. #ThanksTwitter for shaming him into it.
I still think you're lame - too little too late.
US military tries to help Americans!
Alleged commander in chief is dumb as a brick!
Tied up to his ears to the Russian mob!

Dios mio desbastador.apiedence de esos seres humanos.
And folks this is why they tell us to prepare such terrible devastation, my heart breaks for them! How old on folks help is on the way!
Did the DOD put up this video hoping Frump would see how bad things are?
Thank you for all you're doing.  We wish the president would realize more help is needed, and quicker. No blame your way.
Just get all of the folks off of the island. We can take a family in until they get situated. We aren't the only ones!

Lol. Yes. What a sensitive #broflake that requires his golf course safe space to tweet from while not doing any actual work. 

Very disturbing that DOJ and Sessions are not taking any action in the IRS scandal. Message to all bureaucrats: Do your worst. #loislerner
Now, some real fake news

You leftists bitching on here are absolutely insane
Great Work Guys!
A day Late a &1 Short!  The Military should have been there Day One! You waited till Hillary told you to send the Ship 10 Days Late!m
Great  everyone from puertorico must say thanks in front of media
Thanks we knew it wasn’t true that we were doing nothing
#25thAmendmentNow
They are doing a great job. If our dumb ass president would have not wasted days this would be alot better.
That is a FAKE VIDEO
You didn't talk to the people @VICE did whom have dying families and not seen anyone there to help them. #shame #TrumpLies  #AmericaDivided
Thank you NWO for clearing our Landscapes? :-(
These people I trust
They keep saying to stop making propaganda films but I can't. They are awesome.  I love them.
The military is the only group you can count on in an emergency. They are the best! The government really doesn't have any other group

America is so sorry that our amazing DoD and FEMA have such a weak commander in chief.  Hopefully he will resign soon.
Just crying its, devastating to see my ancestors island so destroyed. Bravo to Military for all the help.
