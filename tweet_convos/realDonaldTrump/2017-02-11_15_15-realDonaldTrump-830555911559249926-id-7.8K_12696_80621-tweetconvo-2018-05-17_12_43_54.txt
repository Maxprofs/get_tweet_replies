Golf at your establishment that you've yet to sign over to your son so the country is paying you money.  #Criminal

Was Obama there? Just curious! He's been on the gulf course for 8 yrs! Thought he was POTUS?  Amateur golfer?
HYPOCRITE! YET YOU SQUAWKED ABOUT OBAMA GOING GOLFING? YOU HAVE TAKEN THREE VACATIONS IN ONE MONTH! U MUST BE LOW ENERGY!
So what was your score?

Thank god your playing golf while the country is slowly spiraling out of control.  Golf that helps.

Instead of going to security briefings
Can you say "conflict of interest? "
Talk about the bizarre handshaking thing you do!! We want to know!!!!
And America is well presented with you as president 
everyone just grow up, as if u watched Ernie on every tour, and drink his wine everyday! Both men are legends!
Three vacations in three weeks. Get back to work!
- you played golf while Korea launched missiles and Flynn conspired with Putin. Tell me again how that makes me safe.
and you have the nerve to criticize President Obama.  Shame on you.
I like Japan more than I like you.
I thought you were against vacations for presidents
What happened to your vehement criticism of Presidents playing golf? You hypocrite!

3 weeks 3 THREE Golf vacations.  Bahahaha  read a book
Abe is part of cabal,you know it.q
