stop tweeting and complaining and focus on figuring out how to lead this country
I'll get off Twitter when he does!
I'm rooting for him to be a good president. I want America to win. I tweet my feelings I can't help it!
typical trump supporter manipulation ! Tweet your feelings Andy ! Same way they can tweet theirs, you can too. Sheesh !
We LOVE you, President-elect Trump! God Bless You always!
Hater, racist and Bigot like the rest of supporters #stopthehate

Hey James move to Mexico they seem friendly but they do enforce their laws. #TrumpWon #getoverit
no face thanks for the advice.. can I grab your pussy(so Presidential) NOT.   #NotMyPresident
That's all the racist liberal can think of  Hey James #TrumpIsComing 
oh, I'm very excited to witness your assault on the First Amendment and the press. You got this, bro!
fascism
Didn't Obama spend 8 years demonizing Fox News?
The entire ordeal surrounding his potential non-qualification for president [birth] was a serious one and could have been resolv
Questioning the eligibility of a presidential candidate/now incumbent wo refuses to present proof of such is not "racist"
fact: surge in new subscriptions, print & digital, with trends, stops & starts, 4 X better than normal.
I just cancelled my NYT subscription.
why? Genuinely curious
why did i unsubscribe? is that what you are asking?
yeah
their letter basically only came because trump won, had trump lost they never would have written the letter
trump should now that people elected hillary!!
no !! 
Check the results man! 
Hillary has a lead of almost 6lac votes
even you know that! 
Hillary won by the hearts! And trump only won by the system!
no one will buy this!! 
Every one loves hill man!!
You only won power by spouting numerous lies. Your tenure is therefore totally invalid and the people should repudiate it.
you people are truly confused. President Donald Trump was elected by the people not paid for. Wake up!
Elected by lying again and again and again. There is no way the people should accept he won power legitimately.
and you're saying Hillary won the primary legitimately? turning a blind eye to Wikileaks i see!
We did not support Hillary either. We support no one who supports the continuation of capitalism.
the biggest lie of all time, socialism works.

then change your name.
You are the president now. Act like it.
actually he is not the President at the moment
President elect. I stand corrected but he will be in Jan.
or not
seriously? You're the president elect!!! Act like an adult.
couldn't have said it better
he makes so angry that 60 million Americans are trusting him
he should have his social media taken away and he needs to start behaving like the president elect
.@Tanni_GT @jim72182 @nytimes He can't. He's not going to suddenly not be a racist, sexual predator, conman. Let's not normalize him.
Wow, @realDonaldTrump wants to shut down the press & doesn't seem the least bit concerned that white supremacists & dictators love him. Sad.
He threatens to sue anyone who writes anything negative about him & oftentimes does. Very tyrannical behavior.
.@KerriAdams10 ok, this is good.. How do you deem information to be inaccurate? What brings you to that conclusion?
.@KerriAdams10 The media looks at trends from different voting blocks to establish patterns, & college educated is a reasonable 1 to look @
Stay off Twitter!
all he ever does is attack people on twitter.  Shouldn't a President show a little class?
thats the worst argument ever.  Like he's gonna get respectful on inauguration day!
Where was Trump on Veterans Day? Did not attend a single event. Not one.
respects no one.  When he starts giving respect, he will get it back.
4 years from now, millions of people will be sick of your lies and capitalist greed and they’ll want REAL change next time.
Like we had the last 8? I think not. Get it through your leftist head that you crooked lady lost!
Get it through your own head that we never supported capitalism-supporting Hillary either.
who did you support then?
We support the people being fully in control of their own lives. That's genuine socialism.
Go ask Venezuela how their 'genuine socialism' is working for them.

It just proves that even when the purest form of Socialism is attempted, it still fails.
When you lied on your resume but you get the job anyway @realDonaldTrump
That statement is more accurate for Obama. Clinton is a murderer that got away with it because she has money.
Really! Whom did she murder? Where is the indictment? Stop being foolish.
God help us..they vote & that's why we're in this situation.
No we are in this situation because idiot democrats are rioting in the street
What? I WS talking about election; not post election. Hope you are as horrified by the threats and violence by Trump's white supremacists.
I haven't seen any... If I did I would definitely. What about you & the riots?
Riots not the word I would use for majority of protests; there have been a few violent breakouts. I condemn those. Most were peaceful.
You won, Mr. Trump. Don't destroy the world and please follow through on your promises to working class americans
hypocrisy perhaps???
i am hoping that we don't burn. I want unity.
I see that,  totally love everyone huh??
New un-rigged polls show 1 in 3 Trump supporters are rapists. The other two are pedophiles.
And you are clearly a liar.
@draiochta14 @nytimes This is not the behavior a President elect should have with these kind of tweets.
attacking newspapers?? Yeah, questionable
electoral college is designed to PROTECT THE MINORITY POPULATION. Please learn what it is before you debate.
Please, somebody take his phone!
Oh, come on. The only good thing about @realDonaldTrump being President is laughing at his tweets. #FunnyNotFunny
I just subscribed
what?
where should I go back?
I've never been there so how would I go back. Seems like you're the one who doesn't understand the English language.
YOU WON!! WE DID IT!!!!!
Follow me if you support Trump!
no
the mask of the left has come off and what we see is disgusting.
fuck trump
is that how teachers should talk?
I'm not a teacher?
oh sorry it said student

Did you mean phenomenon: http://www.differencebetween.net/language/words-language/difference-between-phenomenon-and-phenomena …? There are multiples perspectives. Yours is a, not the, view. #Trump
He is back on Twitter with no self-control again. Will not accept him.
If he wants an adversarial relationship with the media and much of the public, this will work. #Trump
Hillary is better
There have been more than 200 incidents of identity-based harassment and intimidation since Election Day, @realDonaldTrump. Any comment?
Do you really not have anything better to do than troll? Quakes in NZ - give the PM a call and see if they need help. #eqnz
IT'S OKAY DONALD. I JUST SUBSCRIBED TO NEW YORK TIMES AFTER READING YOUR TWEET.
. @realDonaldTrump @nytimes

Please stop tweeting.

.@realDonaldTrump
@UnPoliticalPrty @nytimes
We should all dance in the streets when he is gone, because we took back our country!
There was no phenomena. Only 25.5% of the population voted for you and you got less votes than Romney.
Your a stupid bitch. Do you know who I am.
*?
She said he got less votes than Romney. True.
Dont have a #politicalgridlock
is it too much to ask that you stop tweeting & focus on the massive responsibility you've been given. Eyes forward
Attacking the free press once elected to power is the act of petty mind
Not like this would encourage anti-Semitism that @nytimes reporters have been facing or anything
Reporters receiving anti-Semitic mail, experiencing harassment, and more (details in our @ReliableSources digest: http://eepurl.com/com8hv ) 
.@realDonaldTrump "phenomena" is plural, just FYI
...aaand the troll is back. time to think different 
.@realDonaldTrump @nytimes
I can totally see @realDonaldTrump tweeting some secrets from the White House because a meeting didn't go his way. Should be entertaining
It really is now time to stop tweeting in this vein, @realDonaldTrump; seriously. You'll be President. Start acting like it @nytimes
good luck with that
my bet is; resigns or impeached within a year 
not impossible.
please make sure you hire ex-muslim advisors, they will help you a lot.
Sounds like it could be a good idea but how do you vet and ex-muslim when the Muslims practice #Taquiya?
Bring them to mama. I can tell the fake from real :)
.@realDonaldTrump @nytimes hey, you won already. Take #MichelleObama @Flotus advice, go high, start leading the country so we feel safe!
Dude,You have won. Get used to being criticized and mocked. Focus on #MakeAmericaGreatAgain and prove them wrong.
@marsialynn86 @nytimes  NYTimes choose their demise.. People can BREAK any of those smut newspapers & MSM..
Big time.
Well the @nytimes have gained this subscriber @realDonaldTrump

KARMA IS A SWEET REMINDER THAT LIES WILL NOT BE TOLERATED !
#boycottNYTimes hopefully they will be out of business and have to find a real job!
Reading comprehension clearly not Trump's strong suit.
There will be a "cost"...Betrayal of Journalism. Media must reflect America's "Golden Age" or be replaced.

In the singular it's "phenomenon." "Phenomena" is plural.
 about to be vacant building in Times Square.
Totally false. How does President-elect of  US manage to state National Enquirer-type falsehoods? You're embarrassing the nation, dude.
if there are 196counties and we give money to 175 why?most of them don't like us anyway. Cut the budget here
I actually just subscribed! Thrilled to support journalists & excellent reporting. We need you now more than ever.
Quit. Whining. It must be intolerable to be around you.
Please stop making up your own reality. If you're going to lead this country you need to stop acting like a child.
@googilizer touched over 200k people with his tweets supporting you.
Can I go to bed now? @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
I just subscribed. Hope that'll balance it out.
More than 1/2 of your Twitter followers are bots. You & your family are traitors & liars.
@1776_Yankee @nytimes
Donald you better believe it
Wow! The @nytimes still has SUBSCRIBERS? Who knew?
，Then what is the true Trump phenomena？
FACT from NY Times Monday Nov 14 2016  
Subscription growth rate exceeds that in same period of last quarter
ROTFLMAO! No paper did more to tear down the Clintons for you!
Actually, subscriptions are up & the word phenomena is plural for phenomenon. But you don't read much, do you?
They've gained 41,000+ subscribers since election night. You wish you could run propaganda media like Kim Jong Un.
@SharonMcCutchan don't worry about them

Except Sean and Judge JP Oh and Lou Dobbs,  We do what needs to be done.
wrong
Wrong!
the New York Times knows a borderline personality with narcissistic tendencies when they see it. I read NYT.
@TuckerCarlson Academia malign Jefferson. He INHERITED slaves &it was against the law to free them http://www.blackpast.org/primary/declaration-independence-and-debate-over-slavery …
My view:  The NY Times is an excellent publication
John Bolton for secretary of state!!!!!

. @realDonaldTrump It is not a phenomena - you LOST the popular vote. Don't ever forget that. @nytimes
please do not use TV news to talk to us.  Town Hall?
BULLSHIT
Guess we're doing a great job. on this end also. MSM. newspapers, products. Like Pepsi :( lol
No. The NY TIMES is losing subscribers because YOU were the 1st headline everyday. Irresponsible reporting.
The Arizona Republic called me to apologize for endorsing HRC.Saying they shouldn't have.
best news yet keep Boycotting
my first tweet - go Mr Trump go!
buying subscriptions for family & friends for XMAS
there's nothing inaccurate about repeating word for word what you say. It's your own fault you look so bad.
trump phenomena?  You mean your Hitler youth group right?
Shouldn't you be learning what being President entails, @realDonaldTrump ,  instead of wasting time tweeting ? 
@nytimes
#PizzaGate #Pizza_Gate for the trust! satanic ritual
