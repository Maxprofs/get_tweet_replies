Good Job Trump. God bless your Day. Jesus Christ is the Boss.
Did Putin order you to alienate our allies while kissing his ass, or did you think that up on your own?

this has nothing to do with #Trump why would educated mess with u educated trump.

.@realDonaldTrump iPhones are better.
@Apple #Iphones are overrated.
thanks you too.

bye bye Apple
too bad all those uneducated folks you promised jobs to won't be able to fix the robots doing those said jobs.
Hopefully put on of those dodgey S7s near his face.
are you still using that unprotected android tho?? Where my hackers at?
@POTUS @samsung @axios Thats my last Samsung. Phone/TV, anything.
yah and I "may" go to Mars.  Just shut up unless you have something real to say.
if you see your shadow today does that mean only 6 more weeks of presidency?
8 years buddy, don't get it twisted.

Does Samsung have products that can survive a nuclear winter?
Don't you have an apple?
great start President Trump!
Samsung should come to Mexico. Production would be cheaper.
Mr.Trump you are doing a good job... This helps my India do good things in near future ... Jai Hindh :)
lol, @KiddeSafety is gonna make America great again.
The Reuters article this article sources said they were citing anonymous sources. You said never trust anonymous sources

US Treasury, without Congressional knowledge, just lifted sanctions on Russia #FSB http://bit.ly/2klMPJD  
#apprentice
Four people have been charged with treason by Russia for passing on secrets to US intelligence, defense lawyer says http://ln.is/money.cnn.com/2017/0/SAlEl …
Why lift sanctions on Russia's FSB? Oh, yeah. Putin owns you.
#theResistance
I guess we know the answer to this. #TheResistance
Winter is coming, y'all.
#StopDeVos Some of your voters are having some serious #Trumpgrets. #theResistance
And your daily reminder that though you won the EC, you will always be a popular vote LOSER.
it's time to stop the welfare and social security to illegal immigrants and refugees .,pass a bill PLZ ASAP
Yep let the sanctuary cities take care of their own. Not with my tax dollars.
agree with you Marilyn
but your taxes/refund will go towards this wall. Irony. 
immigrants are sucking the life out of America.
.@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @samsung So the TVs in your hotels will not longer will be "Made in mexico"?
You committed #TREASON & you will PAY FOR IT. You will be arrested & spend the rest of your miserable life rotting in jail
The intelligence agencies have investigated and found no signs of correspondence between Trump and RU gov
NOT TRUE. They're still investigating Flynn AND Trump  #alternativefacts
sad you care more about fake hacking by Russia then what was in the emails
Right. 17 US intelligence agencies are "fake." You might as well believe in Scientology. Sad!
but your so worried who did the hacking not the criminal activity in the emails that's sad
there was NO criminal activity in HRC's emails: FBI exonerated her. Trump still being investigated
Arent u worried about Muehler impeaching u?George Webb says what will happen in fall. He gave Comey and McCabe complete immunity!
Mueller can't impeach anyone and Republicans won't do it. Trump is safe.
I hope you are right but I don't trust Muehler, McCabe or Comey.we know how they can frame.look what they did to Flynn.RINOs not dependable
I do trust him...I do not trust ones wanting to bring him down....the way Mueller was appointed to Special Council when there no crime
It will all work out.
you're supposed to include #ad for sponsored posts, as per FTC guidelines.

you're supposed to say #ad
I SWEAR I DIDN'T SEE IT OOOOOPS
LOOL
Creating jobs upsets liberals. They prefer everyone but the elites to be on welfare. Well done Mr. President #MAGA
ترامب ذكي .. سامسونج باقي ماسوت شي مجرد خطط وأفكار ، هالتغريدة بتضغط عليهم عشان يسوون شي بأسرع وقت 

@realDonaldTrump
Judging by his National Prayer Breakfast speech think @realDonaldTrump could use a history lesson on his own country @SamHarrisOrg @LKrauss1
disagree with you.
Read Thomas Jefferson's letter re: 1st Amendment "building a wall 1/
Awwwww!! So nice!  Unfortunately you’ll have to thank them from jail

Kac is almost over it body language is off she looks haggard. Lies take their toll
Nice!
The unhinged lefties that comment on Trumps tweets are why he won. Keep it up looooooooosers.
Thank you, @Samsung! We would love to have you! https://www.axios.com/trump-effect-samsung-may-build-u-s-factory-2233101986.html …...
So does that mean you will be making your suits ties & shirts in the USA? Probably not. $ over citizens.
Obama was never gainfully employed other than running a school newsletter, he was less qualified than @realDonaldTrump #45>44
.@realDonaldTrump Hey, Don, did you think of actually reading the content of that article you RTd?
.@lilmidtown 30-yr police officer, in fact. & if u follow thru with that 'overwhelming violence' you RT'd, I look fwd to seeing you in jail.
I MAY win the lottery.

Don't take credit for this.   This was being encouraged by the Obama administration 3 years ago and Samsung, not Trump, caused it to happen.
Mr. President u r doing great things for America! Patriots r united n support for u! Keep up the great work while left keeps imploding!
Thank you For putting #AmericaFirst #Jobs #MAGA
Support #Samsung
You know...it is a touch odd that you want factory jobs yet want to destroy Americas education with Betsy DeVos.
Betsy is a billionaire buddy with zero experience in education. 
billionaire w/ zero experience.  They are two little peas
Agree with regulatory measures to be sure their phones don't explode and catch people on fire.
they're building a factory to make appliances not phones or batteries.
Thank you. My mistake.
What was not said in this article & we know now, is this company& LG (who by the way was considering before you came) said it 2 Shut you up
trump pls we need factories in africa.pls nigerian government are not building the nation.am jackson

Did you even read this?  "These moves may not add up to significant job growth, but it's hard to beat the PR."
let's make it clear, those whom were violant at berckly are anarchist professional rioters. Read the news
You realize this has nothing to do with you, right? You didn't make this happen.
your mind sucks
Go President Trump!!
@POTUS @samsung tablets and smartphones made in America thank you both perfect
Boycott Samsung no new electronics
On the table since the Obama administration, so no cookies for you, Donnie!
Yep I am adopted, my parents chose me, your parents are stuck with you.
This is an accomplishment. It's important to know that more jobs are lost to autonomous machines than to outsourcing
Your ears are so big when you stand on a mountain they look like trophy handles
trump effect,? Seriously???
there's no such thing as a Trump Effect.
Keyword: May.
If you can't laugh at yourself, I'd be glad to do so for you.
did @samsung tell you that factory will have <20% of the # of workers thanx to digitization! Otherwise it won't pay.
Great! Go for it, Pres Trump! We are with you,!
can we play Note 7 roulette?
Hey maybe they can use the Nanotech bldg @SUNYPolyInst in Utica, NY!! Plenty of brains who need jobs there!
more jobs  or manufacturing is always a good thing. Hang in there Mr President! A lot of us with you
Your ears are so big when you stand on a mountain they look like trophy handles

January 21, 2017, was the high point of the "presidency" of Donald Trump!!
may is the operative word!
Stop taking credit or CEO's who actually know how to run a company.
"MAY" come back. I count my chickens when they hatch.
LIAR
kewl
Funny, this post has turned into a discussion on Putin`s ass.  Not something most people want to envision.
@DrMichaelMcEvoy @samsung @axios Should be able to attract many smaller Japanese companys away from their earthquake areas
Samsung is not even a US company!
@CO Grandma you are as delusional as trump and that's pretty bad
Would be fine if they would hire American workers and not foreigner or illegals....but this will not happen
You're on vacation already? 
Bravo Bravo!! Thanks to President Trump.
you're going to let phones that explode. In the U.S., but don't let Muslims in ? 
they're building a factory to make appliances not phones or batteries.
samsung 
Samsung if you do it would be the biggest mistake you ever made.
STOP DESTROYING US
thank you ladies!
Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.
Your mother's teeth are so yellow, I cant believe it's not butter
Gay? I’m straighter than the pole your mom dances on.
CNN needs to stop disrespecting the president. They haven't even taken time out to understand how Trump operate.
Another win for you Mr President!
Bearing in mind this idea has likely been in the works much longer than two weeks. Not Trump's credit to take.
You are the reason people are blind
wonderful news
Why don't you check up on eBay and see if they have a life for sale.
Donnie, when are you going to fix your Orange Egg Avatar ?
Or is that your new trademark?
What are going to be the environmental impact of having this kind of manufacturing here?
Mr. T. Learn to look beyond your decisions and your words. This insight can keep you from mistakes!!
