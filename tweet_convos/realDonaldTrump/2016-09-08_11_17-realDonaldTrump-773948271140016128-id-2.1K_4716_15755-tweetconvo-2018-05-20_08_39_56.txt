I watched last night and you do not have the temperament or the intellect to be our president. You are just sound bites.
You probably turned TV down after Hillary's miserable performance-that's about her&her scripted filibuster
I watched the whole thing. Trump was a lying talking point.
the invasion lies and he doubles down on it
What are you talking about?
we love you President Donald Trump!  Only you will secure our border and bring jobs back to the US!
because #DespicableDon the idiot is going to let you fight for Russia
thats the dumbest thing ive heard in a long time, you must be a Hillary supporter!
26 followers.. Hillary troll
Sorry more like a troll for @America and sanity and decency and everything #DespicableDon is not
Hillary supporters do not know the definition of the word decency, troll.

Last I checked he wasn't responsible for Americans being killed.
What are you doing. You are going to bankrupt the US. You don't have a filter on your mouth. And have no brain
Please stop making your people lie for you. I know they can't believe what they are saying. They look stupid. OMG STOP
Luis Videgaray is back to México's Goverment, now as External Relationships Minister.
Mexico is our neighbor.  We should be close to them,  but we need good fences as well.
You suddenly care about Mexico?
Maybe if you didn't screw your employees out of their paychecks they wouldn't be quitting en masse.
Never enter into an agreement with DT without having it in writing and fully vetted by your attorney. Pathetic!
Just pay the Clinton Foundation and you can get what you want.
Donate to the Trump foundation and he gets what he wants!!
Fortunately he doesn't use taxpayer dollars to pay you back like Hill did as Sec of State.
only because he hasn't been in govt. DT will ruin our economy,bring war, divide our people
You know this how? As if our economy isn't in the tank already & we are already divided. #deplorable

What illness do you have that you either have to sit or lean on something? Some are saying Vertigo. Unfit to serve.
Never before in our nation's history have we had a candidate as ignorant as you. You sir, have set a new record low.
#RealDonaldTrump Quit mentioning Mexico or the wall except to say that when you are elected it will go into negotions
If you think they are going to make deals with you, you are more delusional than I thought! #delusionaldon
Apparently, they don't want "wonderful" deals unless it's all in their favor.
Is Mexico where your company makes its suits? Ties in Bangladesh. You make nothing in US. Why is that?You're a fraud.

Mexico is going to pay for the Wall? We went to war with France just because we refuse to pay for some cake.
WAR is what you have, not a fucking dimme, bring it on!! cc @realDonaldTrump
How's it working out having that wife beater running your campaign?
Except Mexico's leaders despise you,especially since you lied about your meeting w/ Nieto. There's your 1st problem,genius.

Again...you JUST last night cited the Finance Minister being pushed out as a SUCCESS of your trip!!
Remember: Trump cited guy who invited him (Finance Minister) getting fired as example of how well he did in Mexico 
@luiscarlosmp esta hablando de tu luisin?

You said his resignation was evidence of your trip's success.  You are confused!  What's up, Donald?

Mr. Trump I believe in you and your sincerity to our Country. I can help you in ways to give Police what they need.
