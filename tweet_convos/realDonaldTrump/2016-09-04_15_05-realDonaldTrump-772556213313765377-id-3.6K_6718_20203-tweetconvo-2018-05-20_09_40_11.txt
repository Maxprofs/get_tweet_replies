what the Republican party needs is a real conservative.
Weak low energy people are the worst.

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

Flake is a traitor to American Sovereignty.
Always good practice to go after people on your own team Almost as good as pissing off your allies
Release your Tax Returns - NOW!
Exactly, that's why GOP voters will either stay home or cross the aisle on Election Day!

Kellyann, you better take that phone from Donnie J. I feel a really stupid tweet coming.
The Last thing this country needs is you Donnie
Hillary will triple Obama policies
The US also needs true journalism back instead of political bias doners like George Stephanopoulos, ol Georgee?
republicans attacking one another. This is great
I've never seen so many republicans oppose their party representative. What a joke. He knows he's lost.
I never saw so many Democrats scared as hell that their  pockets  going to get lined anymore!!
no one is scared at all, just start practicing "Madame President" as part of ur vocab
just start doing some fundraising for bail or a medical procedure.
Confusing! Isn't he strong because of Hispanic support? Unless you dissuade Hispanics to vote for Hillary! |:-}
Sounds like Jeff is actually showing courage and a spine.
TRUMP U KNOW YOU'VE LOST THIS RACE. There's no way.  Should have kept your mouth shut.
100% Agree, this has been an issue that we have dealt with in our state for many years too long.
The weakest, most thin-skinned nominee the GOP ever elected, Donald J. Trump.
@1chasingjack @JeffFlake Mt Trump Please YOU must be president. Obama changedOUR RITES
The person that has tobully others is the weak one.
Work on your persuasion skills

Trump is weak minded & weak willed.He's not going to do a damned thing except put money in his own pocket
#LowLifeBottomFeederOfALiarInChief

@jimmythemole01 @JeffFlake  Go @kelliwardaz
He had 'flake in his name - what did you expect?! 
NAZI  GOP
What did you expect? His name says it all.

Your habit of attacking people is getting very old.
America needs a President who isn't a psychopath

@coolbearcjs @JeffFlake he's a all talk no action politician whose only goal is to keep getting re elected. CHC loves him
@VeronicaCoffin @JeffFlake - What if we want to stop the growth of gov, reduce the debt, reduce unfounded entitlements?
when DC loves the wisdom of the divine immigration issues will be better handled. Let mercy and law work as one.
You can do it!don't give up, you don't need them!
@JeffFlake is the poster boy for nominative determinism
president of Mexico called you crazy
Hiding her illness, brain damage, only reason she's off campaign trail,
Evidence is piling up, she her ass covered by Obama she'd be behind bars, 13 different cell phones
Your writing is terrible. Another sign that you are not very bright.
Because who could possibly support Trump if they had even half a brain?!?
love the unity
Satan our enemys out n full force against USA dont vote4 Hillary she wont defend an unborn baby!
not voting for HRC but you've gotta be naive to think Trump cares about unborn babies
but he said he would protect the unborn child, even the 10 commandments say thou shall not kill!
 you can't find one politician who follows the 10 commandment's. Trump doesn't even know them
Stevie Im glad u wont vote Hillary she wont put wall like Trump2 keep the criminals out, biased?
hahahahaha ffs enough w this wall

Wooo! @StateoftheInter believes Trump is #LiterallyHitler LOLOLOL. @FranciscoMedRep @realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake "Vere yor Paperz schwein!?"
Check Trump's site. Stop pretending to care about minorities. You don't.
You know nothing. You won't research outside of "The Narrative". @FranciscoMedRep @realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake
Flake is a RINO; that's all the people need to know. Go Mr. Trump!
pss.
@iVoteNetwork headquartered in AZ says Flake has little support from AZ conservatives. Another phony RINO!!
Trump takes himself out of the running by calling for "strong and committed" Republican leaders.
Mr. Trump, do let us know if you find one.
MY OPINION: Best 2 say U were an idealistic, novice candidate, but now realize U cannot & will not deport longstanding Cont
Absolutely!  Flake is a John "Ted Kennedy" McCain ass-kissing RINO!  Fuck that piece of sub-human excrement!
LoL, Obama has deported more people than ALL previous Presidents. You sad little man Donald
he's weak because he can't support a psychopath? Hey Donnie, graduate from 5th grade already. This routine's old
wtf....cuz e doesn't support u?.....ur crazy man
way to go Trump! Mexico appreciated your visit so much Nieto admitted he would pay for wall, right?
Flake is an imposter.  To have him run ads saying hes a Conservative was laughable.  Come on Az boot this flake
Donald is like a new Kardasian. What a tool!
@PeterBeinart @JeffFlake Give it up, Trump; you orangeheaded hobgoblin.
What about wet foot dry foot
: Improvement in education comes when trade schools are incorporated into inner-city high schools for > 1/2 of students.
Sen. Flake, pls do more than not endorsing #Trump. Vow not to vote for him. Vote #Hillary for good of the USA!
You are the weak one, not Flake--an utter buffoon who knows zilch about leadership!
He's well named FLAKE
@MrEd4011 @JeffFlake

and I think that Vic Berger IV is four times idiot.
@VicBergerIV @realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake Vic is a mess!
agree
@LadyPat18 @JeffFlake TRUMP WILL GO DOWN AS THE BIGGEST EMBARRASSMENT TO THE USA! HIS BACKERS WILL WALK AWAY,priceless
he is a strong Republican. That's why he doesn't support you.
I'm w Flake & other Repubs that have courage Join the drumbeat: "Trump release your taxes"
Flake is a big supporter of a mass amnesty for illegals!
so when will a Republican run for president in 2016...??
Taxes? BIRTHER!
I like jeffFlake stand up for what you believe in
Any one with an R after their name not supporting u isn't worthy of comments from u. Ignore Ignore Ignore; best.
Is the real Donald the Trump who is not ruling out anything, " & "going to make that decision into the future?"
Yes, and we need to change those MANY LAWS that shield people like Crooked Hillary so they can be prosecuted.
@oneputtpatrick @JeffFlake Hillary kkklinton is the world's biggest racist!
I'm sorry but mr. softy flake is a flake. Enough of these super soft super weak politicians. LEAD! #TRUMP2016
You're fighting the Republican Party makes it easy for Democrates to stop any legislation you put on the table!

says the guy who endorsed pro-amnesty hacks paul ryan and john mccain.
someone replace @realDonaldTrump's phone with one from punkt. @JeffFlake
Stay the course @realDonaldTrump
==> @JeffFlake is a progressive globalist & a complete fraud. He lied 100% to Arizonans to get elected. He must be booted!
What do you expect with a name like Flake.
I guess it is obvious who you are running against.
@J  JEFF  FLAKE HAS a NAME that says it all  HE'S A FRIG'N FLAKE!!!!!

Go Flake go. Ignore the Great Insulter.
No opportunism and complacency is great for Americans.
Jeff Flake has "a pair" whereas Trump lacks brains and balls. I salute you @JeffFlake !
Arizona filled w American traitors
Flake is owned by lobbyists.  Stay the course Trump!  They're on the run
#trumpforpresident
I support McCain, Flake and Schweikert in my state PRECISELY b/c they don't support you. If they did I'd vote D.
from the guy that actually has no immigration plan
he's not week he has skin in the game !! He's a Sheep
will you first deport the hundreds of illegals you have working in your hotels & resorts in the US?
So today it is Jeff Flake.Aren't you running out of people to denigrate and stomp on?
Donny how do you stop illegal immigration???
stop name calling and talk issues. This is why Democrats will win elections. GOP is stuck in the 50's.
you are curse on the republicans
who is going to pay for the wall?yo didn't even ask the question. Let's talk about weak. #weasel
Sorry but thanks to you there is no Republican Party. You have destroyed it! Conservatives don't believe anything you say!
"The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders?" .. Well, that leaves YOU out!

cannot wait for the election to be over so I won't see Trumps face on here again. Boring!
.@realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake How will you ever work effectively with Congress when you can't even stop antagonizing your own party?
STOP THIS! Take your hits. It's part of the package you're buying. Are you TRYING to lose this??
- he is more worried about himself than our great country
.You may have to use Executive order to straiten out this mess,only so many hours n a day, no help from GOPe
yes they do but the party know as republicans is going bye bye
unlike you Trump,Jeff is a strong leader to call you out when ur wrong!Standing up to ur rhetoric, thank u Jeff!
Well, maybe you ought to pack up and go home, then, Donnie Hairspray.  You're weak, ineffectual, and a loser.
Critics right on this one--punch up.  Flake is nobody and doesn't deserve the attention you allow. No win
And Jeff Flake would be a stronerg and more committed President than you.
ha... poor fragile infantine chimp.... flake got under your thin orange skin.... good on... arizona blue!

All the GOP leaders are weak and lack  integrity  to do  what  is  best  for the country.
Strong does not mean volatile, vain, uninformed, vindictive, racist, shallow, self-serving, flip-flopping 2 win.
Trump, you are the weakest person to ever run for President.  You whined when Megyn asked you a question.
@MattWelch @JeffFlake Stopping illegal immigration is easy.Stop making so many people illegal.
#NeverTrump
#JohnsonWeld2016
I am supporting you only because I feel I have to! You better hope there are more people like me!! But why make it harder??
can't wait for that
@PeterBeinart @JeffFlake The GOP is dead. It's devolution into a racist, know nothing, proto-fascist cabal is complete
You don't know what you are doing Donald. How U going to do it with article 12 of the constitution?
Leave America in the hands of somebody that's not looking for fame.
.@realDonaldTrump Not only can you be baited by a tweet, but also an AP report about @JeffFlake not supporting you. You are childish AF.
It is inarguable that GOP _cowardice_ and moral bankruptcy has enabled far too much of Obama's disastrous agenda.
Do not forget you are an immigrant too, so your wife etc...
Jeff flake must have just talked bad about you for you to tweet this. such a 5 year old!
Don't fight the Republicans, they will come or not, what you need is what you have THE PEOPLE
Donald republican party needs to drop u
