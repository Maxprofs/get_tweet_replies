And Lou why don't you challenge him on his disastrous policies? No courage whatsoever.
why is Putin so interested in making Donnell our next president what is he going to get out of it
Hillary released her plan in May...which is more comprehensive than this one if anyone cares?
If you vote for #CrookedHillary you are continuing the destruction of America! #BasketOfDeplorables

@heavenlyitalian Mothers, listen up! This is very sweet!!


Destiny- lose Presidency, lose brand worth, business's worth,lose body guards, deplorables come 4 him
what do you know about child care. You just slept with the women but didn't raise the children.
it's fantastic !
neither u nor ur empty headed daughter know sh#t about the needs of middle class families with kids
I don't think govt should get involved with child care and maternity leave.
Have we seen all of Donald's personalities that's why it's so important that we see is Texas who is he
Destined for jail!
HAVE YOU ANY CONCEPT ABOUT CHILD DEVELOPMENT. SHOW YOUR TAX RETURNS
deplorable is BHO at UN campaigning  instilling fear around the world should be treason needs locked-up
Then our destiny is horrifying Democracy is fragile and he's fraying its fabric

Just a pack of lies, Dems have been trying for child care for years with blocking from @GOP!
Donald want to do away with affordable healthcare what are you going to replace it with
@FoxNewsI would ever leave my kids around u u just send them to boarding school & get them when they are grown
It is amazing! read this
DESTINY LOU & I know you've been waiting a LONG TIME for this kind of POTUS!
No. not waiting for #BillStarbuck  #TheRainmaker

Lea Dobbs a communist liar Brit who hates America
But tell them where you plan to steal the money from to pay for this. Unemployment funds.

Bravo - Keeping Mothers Working is a Competitive Advantage & Good Business Too!

What about child support reformation? The debt and interest makes it impossible for the other person .
hahahaha. if you cared, you'd have always cared #misogynist #narcissist #trumpPutin2016
Suggest corporations earn tax credits providing child care instead of blanket tax cut
Really, Lou, you're OK with this liberal proposal? Another sellout to the looney liberal masochist.
HA-HA-HAAAA! Thanks for the laugh.
the Cheeto-dusted bloviator's plan sucks http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/09/13/four-reasons-trump-s-parental-leave-and-child-care-plan-doesn-t-add/213046 …
You and Ivanka hit it out of the park! A real winner for women and families. God bless you both!!
How @realDonaldTrump really feels about working mothers.  @FoxNews http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-says-pregnancy-is-an-inconvenience-in-the-workplace-a7052286.html … He's the candidate of disaster.
HRC had one a year ago!  Release your taxes, what do you have to lose?
Trump doesn't include men. Hillary's way of paying for it is more realistic and inclusive of all.
do Trump businesses provide paid maternity leave??? Didn't think so
he's never understood any policy
Already in the works AND its  tax CREDIT Not DEDUCTION(big diff) which is reportedly on your site.
Great plan which should also bring in a majority of women voters.
Ivanka is FOS like her father: Trump Enterprises does not provide PAID maternity leave. More T-Rump BS!
Hush mouthpiece.
CLINTON's PLAN IS MUCH BETTER!
if you can't afford them don't have them!!!
Sorry but this sounds like more bureaucracy. Need to shrink, streamline, not expand govt.
would prefer to just do away with the IRS. But restructuring tax rates would improve economy.
Can be paid easily if MY taxes taken out of MY pay actually used to help ME. Tired of tax "Ponzi schemes" .
> $4BIL/YR to illegals w/addtl child tax and Earned Income credit. Take that away, give to AMERICANS.
such a joke, Hillary has had a childcare policy for months and it is more robust than Ivankas.
Let him do it for his own employees first. Until then it's just another Trump lie.
A Business mind can be a wonderful thing for America! #AmericaFirst #Trump2016
video doesn't run

hahahahahahahahaha
#TrumpCares
Yes gives to the rich and takes from unemployment.  The press is second biggest loser - people are first
It's nice to hear let's fix America instead of America sux! It's been a while since we heard crazy talk!
He's the only America 1st candidate I see! For me, that makes him the only candidate! Go Trump/Pence 16!
@chassie34 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ChastityTamu I like this word Childcare not Obama care
@ChastityTamu
So overdue! Paid for 100% by denying ALL welfare to syrian refugees or illegal migrants. USA first!
I've been on this train since day 1, sounded to socialist for me... I didn't like it.,
Would be ideal if more employers retained their employees by creating daycare facilities at work.
I think it's great that Trump is "pro-family" as a businessman & future President for nation.
In my workplace, female employees have difficult time finding daycare at 6 am for early shifts.
Child care is vital for most working parents especially when it comes to being asked to work overtime.
Trump is never afraid to see the truth, to talk about it and to have a solution. He's the absolute best!
If you can really pay for it like you plan to, it sounds great
This is GREAT!!!!!
Ultimate pandering. Why don't trump employees have this plan?
forsoure
great program. What a President Trump will be he cares.
Destiny to return to his Financial Empire.
oh please destiny are you crazy ? #DONTHECON

Keep being deceived Trump. We Bernie Sanders across are coming for you to win it for experienced Hillary
Question,who is a "NATIONAL DISGRACE"?
sexist policy.  1950's viewpoint like all his other views. Where is paid adoption leave for fathers?


agent orange is not getting intelligent women's vote by pandering that pathetic child care bill.
Sounds like a "liberal" plan to me!
plan sounds stupid it would never make it of the floor
Hey Donald! Release The Audit Letter U Liar

Unfortunately Trump's destiny is ours also.
What is the child care policy for employees at Trump Enterprises? Such a farce!
Ridiculous proposal. Tax credits for child care helps only the very rich, not the middle class.
DISASTER for families!
Tulsa Country needs it
How many times is he going to change this"policy"and then require translators to say "what he meant..."
Three losers. @IvankaTrump
its,worth talking about
@CharlesHurt  Incentives are needed to make work competitive with welfare
Your new policy on childcare....
Hillarys Trust rating is 11%. Trump should be stomping her - Pick it up Big Boy!
What a joke.
is a deplorable human being!  Hillary 2016!
Does his company currently offer these great benefits he promises He also promise to pay his contractors
@magnifier661 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
hers is better for Women and lower income families that need it the most!

yah. He's the candidate of destiny just like Martin Sheen in the missile scene in The Dead Zone...
Destiny? Or Density?
Sad! The IRS NOW pays 20-35% of child care expenses up to $6,000. No More Free stuff but #NeveriIlary
Tax cuts mean pay less. Designated accounts means SOCIALISM. Not taking my children. Tax CUTS, or lose.
Clinton has been on this for years: https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/paid-leave/ …
Which wouldn't help the woman Ivanka told the story about, or many others. Especially single Mom's
#Trump Hits a home run! Wow! http://video.foxnews.com/v/5123823825001/trump-outlines-new-child-care-policy-proposals/?playlist_id=928378949001#sp=show-clips …
. Trump's plan can work without impact on debt if it is NOT given to illegals and refugees
so nice Trump has his own tv channel...so much for "fair and balanced"..as if it ever was...lol
destined to go down in historic fashion
Still pissed that CNN gave you the boot, eh Lou?
I laughed all the way through those lies.  You are so freakin' sick...compulsive LIAR!

Added  entitlements while swamped with Natl debt = reconsider vote. Need less Gov involvement, not more.
@sme4201968 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump looks more presidential than Obama. He is a trash talker
Magic is in the air.
Too little and too late to save the women's vote. Now we have IVANKA making policy. Christ save us

Economist Says Trump's Childcare Plan 'Full of Holes' and 'Makes Absolutely No Sense' http://fb.me/1hTFixtJA 
It's about time someone addresses childcare for working families. This issue has no party lines
$5000 tax deduction end of year divided by 52 weeks = $96 a week up front. Good luck with that, it's BS
@HillaryClinton COLIN POWELL :TODAY SHOW:"DONALD TRUMP IS A "  PARIAH.A DANGEROUS MAN."

Everything sounds good lately coming from Mr. Trump. What the hell is Hillary's vision? I know donors with cash.

YES! Destined to fail. Your party is growing with uneducated white men and the party is getting older.
Who will pay for this mythical child care plan?
: "Destiny" will be of the contd #OrangeFace #WarOnWomen given his documented malevolence toward females.
you lied and said Clinton has no child care plan that was a lie, she has had one for a year now.
Yeah, destined to fail.
