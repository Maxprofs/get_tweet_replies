Ok
Mr Trump is a good president at least he's not an hypocrite like the others. He does what he says and has no time for underperformers
Your Businesses in Scotland LOSING millions, First illegitimate Liar and Thief to Go BANKRUPT while in office! LOSER PLAYS HORRIBLE GOLF!
باید در برابر ایران هم متحد شویم تا جهان عالی داشته باشیم دخالت ایران در کرکوک  یمن بحرین کردستان جاهای دیگر باید کو بشود
Are you bipolar?  Is that what the problem is?
What in this tweet was objectionable? Soothe yo self girl.
Lol - his flip flopping on PR is just pretty damn funny to me.  They owe! We'll help!  We have to make a decision! We're here w/ you!
You're right there 
@realDonaldTrump should've gone to #PuertoRico days ago! There is no excuse for #PuertoRicans not to have water & electricity by now! #Maria
Every single transmission line & service line was down. Govt had spent $0 on maintenance for the last 2 yrs. Worst electric grid in USA
Lol. See Trump's tweets in response to how @POTUS44 dealt with hurricane #Sandy. Running a govt is hard! He can't live up to his own stds!
Instead of worrying about how much we spend out of the budget helping why not take time away from all the golf you play
Trump said he'd drain the swamp in Washington D.C. but so far all he has been doing is draining the Trump Sewer Team.







You didn't write this. Yes, do try to spin your earlier tweets.

You are incompetent and divisive.

Worst president in US history.

Shut up Princess Bonespur
I hope this is sarcastic.
Trumps daily dose via Twitter of chaos and mayhem.It is from his mental illness.Be compassionate towards him.And he will change his tune
Then get off your lazy ass and do some damn work. You talk a big game but can’t back shit up. Get out there and try to make an effort.
Just shut up.

Did u have a stroke????!!!  Everyone has been united except you !!
Amen
You didn't write this one. Nice try.

You forgot "dumb"
DO something stop tweeting people are DYING #ImpeachtheGrifter #PuertoRicanLivesMatter #PuertoRicoCrisis #PuertoRico
I'm sure the Brits are doing all they can for their islands & ppl..
JUST LIKE WE ARE! 
KEEP DOING THIS AMAZING JOB TO AMERICA !!! THX SO MUCH MR. PRESIDENT !!
Remember Trump and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 
Now that was the presidential way of saying what you tried saying this morning
The damage has already been done. You already alienated pretty much every Puerto Rican
And every kind and decent human on the planet.
This would have been a great tweet two weeks ago.
LOL my thoughts exactly.  It's like he just found out this happened...and went golfing.
HOPEFULLY GENERAL KELLY BITCH SLAPPED THE SHIT OUT OF YOU!
If we must be united, why are you attacking the mayor of San Juan?
How about resign and allow the adults to fix your mess
Get in the sea.
Hello?  General Kelly? For the love of all things sacred, PLEASE take the racist-in-chief's phone away.

Trump didn't tweet this ! Just tell him that we hate him more than ever & that he's a loser.
#TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist
#TrumpIsKillingPR

Hahahaha. U can't say this with seriousness after U (YOU!!!) bash those on the ground. 
Get off twitter and get to work!!! Seriously
Glad to finally have you on board!!   Now let's quit pointing fingers and call in the "cavalry."
Do you day drink often?
"We" includes you, too. Put down the phone and stop picking fights with the mayor of San Juan. You can't win.

DO YOUR JOB.
Then stop golfing
Then send what they need. Manpower, food, medicine. Action not empty words. Now.
You can start by apologizing for your inappropriate and demeaning remarks about San Juan's mayor and her leadership.
Once you've done that, you can then apologize for whining that Puerto Rico wants everything done for them.
President Trump leads with Action, not talk.. The media is used to 8 years of having a talker in chief, not a commander in chief with Obama
President Trump is the strong moral leader that America needs!
For 8 years, America had a morally bankrupt cover-up artist in the White House! America turned the ship around on November 8th! #MAGA
There is a night and day difference between President Trump and Obama
Obama spent as much time golfing as most who are on the PGA Tour! It was truly sickening to watch!
President Trump and Mike Pence have always been committed to helping disaster victims, even before taking office in 2016
While Trump and Pence were delivering supplies to the Louisiana Flood Victims in 2016, Obama was golfing and sending cash to Iran!
Americans utterly rejected Obama's disastrous leadership and sent Trump to a LANDSLIDE victory! #AmericaFirst

Wow, someone needs a job
Yeah- he's got one - it's called president of the USA. Why doesn't he WORK?!
I don't think being united means criticizing and insulting the mayor of a city who is doing everything she can do to help or citizen survive
You can't even unite your entire administration let alone a whole country after a disaster.
I think we should all unite against you and impeach you
.@HomefrontHugs Here's a case in point. I can't help it if you refuse to see the facts. 
We have many volunteers here who adore @realDonaldTrump like you and many who don’t - but we unify here to do good for our troops and vets .
That is a fact. 

Trump is not apathetic or a racist. Also a fact. 

We agree on the first thing, will have to continue disagree on 2nd.
In a few days or maybe weeks we will hear real death toll, &suffering that took place because we did not stage like we did for Harvey & Irma
Texas & Florida not islands. Help poured in by road and air. Much more difficult to supply Puerto Rico.
And THAT is evident to a 1st grader which is why when a Cat 5 is predicted -you prestage like hell & you are there right away with military
Insults are not uniting anyone. Stop acting like a little bully and start acting like a real president.
After your divisive tweets? What kind of leader is this?
Yes. So what are you doing?
You are fake
Oh, and before you jump off the turnip truck, I am a bloody Republican.  You are childish and therefore do not deserve my respect.
Yeah. Finally, all of this after you got your lazy ass called out for having your thumb shoved WAY up there...TWICE!! #ShutTheFuckUpDonny
REALLY...TOO LATE ALL KNOW HOW YOU REALLY FEEL
Yes.
You & this country have given much & will continue w much appreciated assistance. My family thanks you.
But first, you must golf. And last weekend you golfed. While Puerto Rico suffers, you golf.
You do nothing to unify people.  Your leadership skills are a disaster on all fronts. #impeachtrump
The  apologize for responding to her pleas for help with criticism and  divisive words. She is desperate, you are (supposedly) the president

What assistance do u offer us, the people who are suffering from you??!
Who is this? Is this the housekeeper tweeting this? It can't be trump?
then get to work uniting everyone instead of tweeting hate at the people who are suffering, moron. lead by example!
Why did McCain have to shame you into lifting the Jones Act?  You did it for Florida and Houston.  Why not Puerto Rico?  #RACISTPIG
Too bad you are not united with a majority of this country. #sad
Thanks gen. Kelley for taking shit bags phone away from him!!
How much have you donated?
The great divider preaching we must be united?


Yes give Texas, US Virgin islands, Peurto Rico, Florida the aid they need along with the state's out west with wildfires!
yeah? you start
Just please don't give anything $$$ to San Juan mayor. I wouldn't trust her.
If you want to help people of PR; have DoJ FBI arrest mayor of San Juan; she's criminally corrupt
donald trump is responsible for 33 million of puerto ricos debt due to his failed golf course there
Exactly - YOU should have supported the Americans from Puerto Rico. Shame on you.
Yes we should

Says the greatest divider in modern history.
Is he the disaster he's referring to?
Too late now buddy. After your meltdown and tweets on a  mayor who is going door to door helping people.
#Arrogant #Uncaring #Racist #Tyrannical #Unfair #Sexist #Communist #Greedy #Dishonest #Cynical #Untrustworthy #Explosive #Dangerous #Moron
The 9 to 5 president, leaves work at 3:45 on Friday to play golf while America suffers #UnfitForOffice
ASSHOLE oh excuse me i sneezed
who wrote this? Because it was not 45.
Tell yourself that
Stop playing golf and do something then. You want to play golf, do the rest of us a favor and resign
Yeah?  What have you done but delay getting help there, insult Puerto Ricans, and go golfing. Disgraceful little fraction of a man.
If you want to unite people, I suggest refraining from name calling and insults.
I just can't with this
We must get rid of U and get a REAL LEADER
DAMAGE DONE This will be "FOREVER REMEMBERED" As 
"TRUMPS KATRINA" Wear that badge even after impeachment,
Your Children saddled with it SAD
At least the 4 prior Presidents aren’t afraid of getting their hands dirty
Kinda like the trump kies great job! @realDonaldTrump  have fun golfing#
YOU...I'll say it again for you to catch up...YOU are the one dividing us!!
is there lack of thoughts and prayers? do you need more thoughts and prayers? I can post on FB that I'm giving all the thoughts and prayers
True

So just what are you doing other than golfing and maligning the PR mayor?  Intimidated by an ethnic woman of color?  Seems to be a pattern.
Go play golf and stop tweeting
Now all of a sudden you want to be presidential?
Day one you should have had people out there helping. Yes it is an island, but Not hard to get to. Loser!
fraud
Even if all you can offer is your prayers it's helping!


Citizens doing what your government hasn't
You are erratic
Our response could be better faster.  You are not leading well
while you tweet insults about the mayor who is trying to help her people. aight then
#TrumpsKatrina
By golfing??
Except for you.  You just ha e to be united with your self serving self.  You care about you and only you.
Exactly @HillaryClinton u can learn a lot from our wise President!
Slamming the mayor of San Juan for speaking the truth is United in offering assistance?
Hey, #FailingPresident @realDonaldTrump - if you want us to be united, stop attacking the mayor and do something constructive.
I don't think you actually write this tweet. It sounds to decent.
How about uniting with the Mayor of San Juan before you ask us to do anything. We've already been helping the ways we could, but you are dividing this country yet again making people feel that we shouldn't help them. You are a shameful excuse for a President. #PuertoRicoCrisis
Who stole your phone?
Wow, that only took you about a week. So unfit to be President.
Why are people acting like this makes him a hero? It's been a week since these hurricanes hit and he is the leader of the free world.
Then get off the golf course and get your fat ass to #PuertoRico. Lift a box. Serve a meal. Do something useful. #StormTheBastille
Yeah right 
Should we meet in the golf course?   LOSER
A+
No way has Trump written that statement.. it makes sense
Donald we know it's not you love, the spelling is too accurate.
You can always tell can't you. It's like a staffer says, 'quick! He's in the John, grab his phone!'
Vice President Pence Retweeted
No shit.  Why did it take you so long to react ?
Oh must we? But those Puerto Ricans just want things done for them. Those lazy thirsty suffering swimming in sewage terrible brown people
United? Are you kidding? You only help like minded and light skinned.
Sounds good! Let‘s see if the President of the US comes threw. You can start by erasing some of that debt that‘s killing PR.
does that mean we should all start dedicating trophies to the suffering?
Take your own advice.
Did Kelly take away your phone in order to get this in?
Give assistance to those who were unjustly forced to lose from you making pact w/ Fed Reserve to unlawfully manipulate up the stk market!!!!
Twitter should really honor you. . Lol who reads tweets just before dying.. I am not saying you are doing nothing tho.
Uh, who took over your account? #resign #ImpeachTrump
What are you doing about it?
Yes!!!! And the Airlines must stop the price gouging in Puerto Rico
2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE 2 weeks LATE
AND YOU MUST STOP LYING.
who authored that tweet? definitely not you.
Then stop attacking, #dividerinchief #donnythedisgrace
Exactly, but not the San Juan mayor! Right, Mr President.
We should cut PR loose. It’s a failed, 3rd world,  corrupt welfare state that contributes nothing to the US economy. Very bad money pit! 
P.R. needs to Remember they R not the only Disaster Site Texas & FL 2 
They R states P.R. Not
Why is US only one they depend on & criticize?
Too late for the about face! We all know you don't give a damn!
Oh Donald, you're such a great uniter!
I heard from hector at church, part of family has water other family members have generator an it's kind of nice they're coming together 
Your a joke

#straighttohell
You have no room to talk about what should be done and being "united". You have messed EVERYTHING up in this country. YOU ARE A JOKE.
Get your butt over there
NFL KNEELING: setting ur own winning agenda! VERY VERY NICE! Party of Trump!
Says the guy spending the weekend golfing at his own club. You must tweet from the toilet; do you stop golfing for any other reason?
If you resign...then your popularity will go up. Approval rating will be 100%.
Did someone force you to write this tweet at gunpoint?
It happened over a week ago, where have you been?
Liar liar liar
Keep ignoring the racist haters! The good guys are with you.
