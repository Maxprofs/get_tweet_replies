We've never seen such fake news as we have recently. It should be looked into big time. We need to seriously consider taking away the broadcast licence. They do breaking news for five hours on Cohen being wiretapped then issue a quiet retraction at 2am on a show no one sees.
You can't have a press that acts like this. We have press freedom like no one else, but it's controlled by just a select few. Maybe we need to break up the monopolies a bit. It simply is criminal what they are allowing. It's DNC propaganda. TOTAL SCAM!
Let's open up some investigations into the media.Let's see how these "sources" are communicating with them so we can nab these leakers on the charges regarding what they are doing. It is criminal and sewing chaos. Will the journalists be willing to go to jail to protect sources?
The more and more we see the news doing what they do, the more the people get behind Donald Trump. Every single negative story is more motivation to get out and vote harder, stronger and smarter! FAKE MEDIA WILL NOT DETER THE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MOVEMENT!
Do you cup his balls when you blow him?
What's the difference between NBC's "Sources" and when you say that "Everybody tells me" in your responses to questions?
Who is the "Everybody" that you speak of?
Why don't you let the Apprentice Tapes speak for themselves Spanks, let's see what kind of POS you really are.

another poorly educated Trumper that needs to communicate with pictures.
Better luck next time Chuck Mangione.
Another triggered snowflake that got his panties in a bunch. Lmfao. Go back to your safe space and blow some more bubbles.
Triggered?  Hahahaha
I'm not the one that tweets about fake news networks, witch hunts, and HRC every single day.
TO ME, that is the epitome of Triggered Snowflake.
Now run along and "Git-r-Done" Larry the Cable Guy.

The Trump Bot Army out in full force today.
@realDonaldTrump Here’s my question: How the HELL does the lawyer of a “billionaire” not have $130,000 in savings?! Why would  he need to take out home loan??? #MorningJoe
And why would the billionaire have to repay that in installments, except to add smoke and mirrors to the situation?
Not installments, you pay expenses as the lawyer invoices them. And why do you care who the POTUS sleeps with??
Ya, not installments, just regular payments funneled through a fake LLC. Exactly, who cares that Clinton got a consensual blowie, oh wait...
How cares, it was consensual, not like the rapist Clinton and Hillary the enabler
It’s so cute how Trump supporters always miss the point.  It’s not the sex, it’s the lies. Trump: Daniels is fake news. OK she is not fake news but there was no payment. There was a payment but I didn’t know.  I reimbursed Cohen for the payment
No....here’s what you hypocrites don’t get “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” in the Oval Office....and you have the balls to be concerned about Trumps playboy life BEFORE HE EVEN TOOK OFFICE!?!?  OH, WHAT ABOUT THIS?

All the media. Tv, newspaper are fake. Can't believe anything they say or print. Fox is an exception.
Your tweets are the only non fake
Please just go away. You’re such an embarrassment to this country
Truth hurts !! 

Trump is now gloating because his attorney's cellphone is only being monitored and not wiretapped.
Well then the investigation should be closed.

NOT

Discrediting the media doesn’t erase decades of conning and criminality my dude!
No see, you lie and then they report it and you get mad. That’s all.
#IMPEACHtrump
We are dealing with very sick people.
No buddy, they corrected their error.  That’s the opposite of fake news.  That’s what real journalism is.
“Like so many others, the sources probably don’t exist”. —John Barron
You lie CONSTANTLY.  How can anyone keep up with what’s true??
Can you form any thoughts on your own without the help of the true fake news at Faux?
Oh look, the pull-string doll wants us to believe he’s a truth teller. Cause he never ever fibs. 

Key Words, "the sources probably don't exist"

Catch Neil's latest Common Sense 

LOL!!!  go back to sleep.
It’s going down, I’m yelling timber!
So...... a bit like John Barron then?


NBC NEWS corrected their story - that is what you call accountable journalism. When will you correct your false statements (bold face lies), and become an accountable president?
As are you!
thankful for your tweets otherwise we be in the dark,sometimes
Shut up.
Unbelievable
Klovn.
At least they can pronouance city and country names... Mr tRump ... you have had a problem with this... SAD

Uh like every report youve bitched about has turned out to be true a few weeks later....

Or are you just saying you...uh I mean "john barron".... are not a reliable source?
They are obstructing justice & releasing classified Intel
THE 4 STAGES OF The trump LIE: 1. It's a total lie, never happened, fake news. 2. It happened, but it's not a big deal. 3. OK it might be a big deal, but it isn't illegal. 4. OK it is illegal, but Hillary or Obama something or the other so it's OK.
Old #Buffoon yells at cloud. Sad!
Shoutout to secret agent of  #TheResistance Rudy Giuliani!
With his shrewd legal advice Trump will be out of office in no Time!
#ThankYouRudy #TGIF

Rudy looks embalmed, and acts like a demented uncle. 

Plus he had tipped Ttump into deep shit. 

But I do agree... he is on .*our* side...:)

They’re still more honest than our so called president, who averages 6.5 lies per day.
You do need to stop watching Faux News Network. P.S. your fear is showing, again.
Awards are given for writing lies so of course they all jump on board to compete now.  Fake News Awards.
Just like the sources who said you were satisfied with Ty Cobb a mere month ago who you called" fake news".

You are the biggest laughing stock in the history of the world you big, fat, orange blob. And the funniest part, you really have no clue how much everyone laughs at you.

I mean really people
We care because it’s an FEC violation and felony because it wasn’t disclosed. How can you still defend someone who lies constantly? You are morally bankrupt.

Maybe worse.
Fabricated fiction?
That is redundantly redundant
You know who is constantly wrong?
You.
Never sure if you are lying deliberately.
Or if you are actually that stupid.
Which is it?
And for the umpteenth time Fox is fake news who have dumbed America down & made it dangerously weak.
Resign Sir as you lie again & again. What’s happening to our country is a disgrace & its you- your fascism, treason, gaslighting, sexism, racism, corruption, lying, and other crimes.
Okay for a POTUS to spread false information to millions all over the globe and to never correct himself or the information given - even when proven to be incorrect? Should we not hold the keeper of 'everything we hold dear in this country' to the highest of standards? #RiseUp
Geez - and all the imaginary sources you use are accurate? I would trust NBC based on their history long before I would trust your sources.

At least they own up to their errors.  When have you ever admitted you’re wrong about anything?

LOVE Steve Schmidt!!!
And you paid out and admit to "Willfull wrongdoing"?? $10 million for laundering money through the TAJ MAHAL? Or Trump SOHO?? Mob owned too
THIS is what should have been done by every journalist from the beginning. 

THIS is not normalizing his shitty behavior.

 #CrookedTrumpHadSexWithApornStar lol
Please. Cavuto is wayyyyy too late to the party.
How often throughout the day are you taking instruction from the Kremlin?
NBC News corrected their story within hours just wondering when Giuliani and @foxnews will be correcting their story given that you say that what Giuliani said about the payment is not true.
They corrected their report.  When have you ever owned up to one of your “fake” tweets??
They redacted the statement. That's the difference between real news sources and Fox News. The correction.
Its gone from fake news to fabrication, to propaganda and now its just outright psycological warfare.

Fewer are falling for it every day... The desprarion of the
Far left and the deep state is palpable now...

LIAR!  Your pathological lying is exposed Daily.  You’re a Traitorous, pathetic sociopath and your prison cell awaits!
You are wrong, you are fake, you always lie, your presidency is a fabrication, fiction.  #poserprez #putinwhore #IllegitimateRegime
You are a disgrace
Specifics are not something you're fond of. Help out the American people and tell us exactly what's not right with the piece. Just saying it's wrong doesn't make you right. Especially when you say things that are constantly needing to be corrected. Truth = Credibility!
So... Everyone, absolutely everyone is lying to the American people except of course for tRump, who has only been caught lying 3000 times in a year and a half?

Nobody should have to hear that many lies from a man they aren't divorcing...

Yes keep on attacking NBC. Hopefully they will release the Apprentice tapes.

NBC corrected it. Perhaps you should try correcting your over 3,000 falsehoods. And release your taxes.
Like the "sources" who "told you" Obama was born in Kenya? The "sources" for your statements all live in your lower intestinal canal. Certainly not your head, because that's clearly empty.

True True So True
Mr President, can you comment on the video released yesterday of Neil Cavuto on Fox basically calling you a pathological liar?
Except he kept saying "I'm not saying you're a liar" and just did everything but that. He should have just gone with it.
I felt he did that to protect himself. By being nice and saying, maybe the DOTUS  is busy, etc, was just a way of not exposing himself to a lawsuit or other problems. It's Fox so I'm genuinely amazed he was allowed to say any of it.
Huh. Seems like you're saying that all the news is fake now... Could it be that all the news is accurate and you're a liar?

When they report #FakeNews they are getting paid with dirty money. They know what they are doing and don't care because the Liberal reporters have no integrity. Don't worry about those fools because one day they will get their due!

What about The Apprentice outake tapes? They’re being sought for one of your many, many lawsuits. This ought to be fascinating.


Go figure

Like yesterday! Emphatically YES!
NBC (National Broadcasting Communists) is always using false information to attack those they disagree with.
Never Been Culpable
You really are a colossal POS. Get your lies straight will ya? #basta #ImpeachTrump
Donald is SICK! 

2 shameful doctors gave him clean bill of health. 

Donald J Trump is SICK!
And NBC issued a correction immediately and repeatedly.  Watch and learn, Pinocchio!  Your method of adding lie upon lie upon lie isn’t working very well!

Just stop already. #HereComeTheJudge
Mr President we know “fake”means your lying! You can’t change the facts.  You attack or law and order like a mobster and believe you are above the law. You work for us the American people and we demand you testify unfer oath to the Grand Jury or be impeached.
yep they messed up a press release, Came back with a retraction, Thats getting it right , Now lets discuss all the Blanton Lies You stood in front of the American people and told, With no truth to them, Wheres your apologies, We will be waiting get back to us on that ,, Fool
They made a mistake & corrected it, exactly as they should do. WHY DON'T *YOU* TRY IT??? You have zero credibility, grifter. #ImpeachTrump
You are fake Donald
And why do we care who he sleeps with again?

@AdamSchefter reveal your sources or you're fake news too
You make claims on twitter ever day, unsubstantiated claims or lies, and they are documented on twitter. Soooo no room to talk liar in chief.
Please keep saying shitty things about NBC so they turn on you and release the Apprentice outtakes
NBC admitted a mistake, something you are incapable of doing. You tell a lie to explain a lie and then tell another lie to explain that lie.  Even when you are on video lying you say you didn't say that.  
When you say "many people are telling me" who are those many people?
All the msm are mockingbird media! They’re all propaganda and social engineering trying to control and manipulate the people. It’s not working anymore! #TheGreatAwakening
And they apologize..which is something YOU, your raggedy gal @PressSec  fail to do on a daily basis.  Jay Sekulow wrote those questions and then released them to the media!  It's amazing how much scum is swimming in the DC pond.
Of course they are wrong!  Fake news is always wrong.  Why are we still calling them news anyway
#NotMyPresident #TheResistance #PresidentSpankyDennison

How can anyone believe you? #FakePresident #Resign #ImpeachTrump[
Since when is it a crime to have sex with a commercial sex worker (occupational sex fellow) or a porn star (one who runs a show business of immorality and sexuality). U people should give the president of the united states a break with all this old and baseless stories. Nonsense.

A far simpler explanation is that Donald #Trump—a #conman who’s spent his life lying to and ripping off Americans—is, once again, lying to #Americans. 

Donald wages war against #journalism because the #truth is Donald’s greatest enemy.

#TrumpRussia #TrumpIsGuilty #TraitorTrump



You’re wrong literally all the time. Unlike you, MSNBC/NBC and CNN are doing fine.
Sad.  If you wold sit down with Mueller this would all be over but all of us have to live through your drama.  Sit your ass down and answer the questions.

Yeah Trumpy... your daily 'Fake News" -  just like #1930s Germany
God Bless You President Trump for all you are doing for this Country. American Patriots stand strongly with you!
Just commit yourself into a home and admit you’re senile

unnamed sources = bullshit we made up
Elect an egomaniacal and this is what you get. Assholes never change there positions. Unless of course it furthers their agenda and keeps the frenzy going. Peace prize please!

If there was as much hate thrown at the real corruption in D.C. that's thrown at Trump, I'd bet we'd have a totally different government.
Godspeed Mr. President, if dual citizenshiped Senate/Congressmen loyalty is not to America&you, primarily; Sir, fire, recuse, replace them.
Ha, ha.  They make a mistake, they immediately correct unlike you who has still yet to realize there is a video of every lie you ever told. Difference between compulsive liar (you) and immediate corrected mistake.  Oh and tweeting it, spotlights your lies even more.
I live that you made sure to use the word "probably"....
Fake news is anything that comes out of the White House these days. You have told so many lies your staff can't even keep up on an hourly basis. But hey, keep complaining about news agencies that don't agree with you, it's all you know how to do anyway.
Ask yourself...is everything that all but two TV stations (Fox News and Breitbart) and 99% of newspapers report, or is the @potus lying? I wouldn't even trust @realDonaldTrump to tell me the time.
What about your safe haven Fox?
Don't forget to include 'Russian Salisbury poisoning, all fake news.
ANY newspaper, magazine or news channel who REPORTS THE FACTS-should NOT be viewed!  You MUST watch FOX!  They are the ONLY TV Station reporting MY LIES the way I like!   FOX & I are ENMESHED as ONE for your viewing pleasure!  
They KNOW & ALLOW MY PROPAGANDA!
#HereIsTheThing Often Times More Than 1/2 Of America Didn’t Vote For The Sitting President, But Overtime We Just Accept Them, But You, Everday You Pick Fight With Amost Everyone Lies, And Refuses To Behave Like The POTUS, You! Are The One That Make America Say #Not My President
Anouncing a correction is a sign of a trustworthy news organization. Most people learn this in school. The president is attempting to use the correction to attack NBC News so people won't believe them when they expose the lies of the president.
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA @POTUS
I don’t think reporting that you’re a complete moron is fake news. I believe that’s a pretty accurate statement.
Where as YOU out and out LIE!!!

They corrected themselves. YOU JUST LIE, LIE, LIE! IMBECILE!
I'm not NBC's biggest fan, but it's always heartening when an individual or an entity admits a mistake and actively takes steps to correct it.
How many thousand of times have those “wrong” reports been correct? You have zero credibility. I don’t know why you bother to tweet any more. Such an embarrassing buffoon!
Media always turns out to be right. Trump makes scurrilous claims of ‘fake news’ and then in the end the media turns out to be correct.
You are such a hippocrit. The whole time that NBC ran the Apprentice you told the participants to lie about the ratings.
CMCSA, owners of NBC, need a little anti-trust magic. Time to spin off all of the divisions of these monopolies and make them compete or go BK. Obama.   #Antitrust MSM
Still the best president ever!! Thank you Mr. President!!
"It's not what you are omitting, it is what you keep stating and never correcting, @POTUS. None of this makes what you say fake, just calling out the press for being so, a bit of a stretch", Fox's Cavuto. "That’s your swamp."  @realDonaldTrump https://youtu.be/eKtfjYwD_Wg   via@YouTube
No honesty or responsibility from Trump or his swamp creatures:
We see you  #DelusionalDon #TrumpRussia #Conspiracy #Treason #StormyWeather
If it's not Fox, it's wrong. If it doesn't shed a favorable light on you, it's wrong or a disaster. Most of the time, YOU are the leaker. Your thinking is the twisted thinking of a narcissist. Knowing you have access to the nuclear codes scares the heck out of me.
The President of the Unites States of America and Leader of the Free World continues to knowingly subvert the legitimacy of his own nation's free press. 

That 1st Amendment really sticks in your chitinous mouthparts, doesn't it comrade Trumpski? 


My sources tells me that you Mr President are doing one hell of a job and will go down in history as the best President ever. And NBC sucks as well!
Mr. President the media “witch haunt”against you remind me of the same magnitude “witch haunt”by the same media in 1970’s against the Shah of #Iran, whose son #RezaPahlavi is leading the opposition 4 peaceful regime change in #Iran as he was called by #IranProtest to return home.

BREAKING NEWS: @FoxNews exposes @realDonaldTrump and receives praise from @CNN for doing it
Unfortunatly you are wrong again, we have a free and indepedent media, which is something that is essential for democracy, so do your homework and watch also other channels except Fox...45
Unnamed does not mean non-existent. Your constant accusations that legitimate news agencies “make up” sources and stories is so desperate and damaging. Verifiable facts exist.
You can't even get your lies straight anymore RS
So your buddy Rudy is going to issue another statement after you, Cohen and he coordinate your stories so you’re all telling the same lies?
That sounds about right RS
Eis me aqui

They actually admit their mistakes and make the corrections while you continue to lie and compound the lies and compound the lies again. We're at the point that nothing you say is to be believed, because you have lied so much and so often.
at least they admit when they make a mistake..unlike Faux News.


"Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action." .@realDonaldTrump

I Guess FAUX news Neil Covuto got it right !
What bothers you more: that it's not fake or that you won't be able to use Twitter from prison?
Media does not make up the stories Ur White House & people U surrounding yourself with Are all out to get U there the ones that go to the media & tell stories the media reports on the stories once they verify  they may not always be true but there is always an underlying truth
You keep limiting the number of stations that will hire you post presidency. Calm down.
And how many times have you called @NBCNews ‘Fake News’ and accused journalists there of fabricating stories... but it was actually YOU who was KNOWINGLY and MALICIOUSLY lying. Still waiting for all those retractions...

NBC News corrected their story, once. You have changed your Stormy Daniels story at least three times. Sad!
I didn’t care when #BlowhornBill & Monica had their thing... Don’t care that #Trump & #Stormy had their thing. Consulting adult — Yet NXIVM in the media... all crickets?!
Is it hard to delegate all the lies? Maybe your staff would be on same page if you didn’t always lie. A compulsive liar doesn’t know he’s doing it. THATS YOU! Sad your staff has to lie for u or they get fired. PLEASE RESIGN! Don’t worry about media, get professional help!

Says the man who has lied over 3000 times to the American people and continues to lie about "preserve, protect and defend" the Constitution of the US! Resign while the getting is good, Liar in Chief!#BlueTsunami2018
LOL   The only thing fake is all your lying and now you have Guilliani throwing you and your legal team under the bus.  Help save yourself and send him back where he came from.

$130,000.  Lie or no lie. Fake or real news. 
Having t-Rump as POTUS is like living with a domestic abuser every single day. Gaslighting, lying, swearing, push-back, ad nauseam. No wonder we feel nauseous every time he opens his mouth or we see him on tv. BARF-O-RAMA. #NotMyPresident
Be careful what you say or NBC will "accidentally" release the audio of you using the n-word. 

So... keep on talking.

Can anyone believe what a LIAR tweets , Dumb donny lies daily. Actually known for it, proven for it, Dumb donny has yet to prove the media lies.
