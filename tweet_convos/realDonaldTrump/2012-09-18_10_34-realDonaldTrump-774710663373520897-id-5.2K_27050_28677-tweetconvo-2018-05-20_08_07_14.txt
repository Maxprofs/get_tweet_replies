@realDonaldTrump don't be fooled. Donald fights for Donald and maybe for Ivanka. He's not working for you folks in the 99%.
sure that's why he was the only one to fly to Louisiana & actually help people that were in need! Ur the hater Anti-Americana!
after the gov asked all big names to stay away to not be a burden on local resources, he shows up...with Play-Doh.
oh ur so"liberal"trying to turn a good deed into something bad ,ma'am he showed up with hope, words of encouragement say LA !
@realDonaldTrump
Calling African Americans "Deplorable" just because they disagree with you is #Racist SHAME on you #Hillary  
.@BarackObama

@realDonaldTrump President Obama's approval rating is at 58% mr baby hands #DonTheCon #SoftAndFlacidDon
@oufenix @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump
why did Hillary wipe 30,000 emails (illegally, on purpose)?
honestly,like the FBI,I don't really care.Why did Donny Rape a 13 yo?
dumb comparison, one a documented fact, one with no police evidence whatsoever. Hillary is lying crook

@realDonaldTrump absolutely!!  Sending this guy back to reality TV where he belongs!
oh ok so I guess u think the last 8 yrs of our country hve just been perfect huh with career politicians?
nope. Try and only use my words.
my man why r u agreeing w/ a known Tyrant while trying to tell a proud American where to go?
STRONGLY DISAGREE! RT @BarackObama We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
Except Obama was doing his best to write off the ENTIRE country & replace it with heathen Islamic barbarians.
You're hilarious & racist. 
So do you think anyone who dislikes a crooked politician is racist? Just because I don't like our criminal ex-President, who happens to be black, doesn't make me racist. I don't like Hillary, or Pelosi or Schumer either.
No. Not at all. It was your negative stereotype of Muslims. Islam is world's 3rd largest religion w 1.8 billion followers worldwide, all varying ethnicities. It's an Abrahamic religion, like Judaism & Christianity. If ur wondering, was raised Catholic, now Spiritual Agnostic.
Since Islam is not a race, calling me racist because I'm not a fan of Islam doesn't make sense. I take issue with those who wish to force their beliefs on others, whether they be Muslim OR Catholic or the guy next door.
You're right. Used the word incorrectly & apologized last nite. IMO, ALL group zealotry is dangerous & there are always zealot militants that break away. I don't want any religious ideology informing policies in our country, yet extreme White Evangelicals r trying.
Agree...the Ted Cruz Evangelicals  are almost as bad! (But they don't go around blowing people up).
President Obama, pls tell us what we need to do to stop this madness.We don’t know how else to stop this nightmare & it seems the GOP is all but untouchable, as they literally control every branch of our government! Pls Sir, we desperately need ur guidance to save our country. TY
The answer is get a f#©K!Ng clue and think for yourself you freaking sheeple...lol
AMEN!!!
Go away
It's up to 70% of the country and climbing everyday, but in actuality he has written everyone except him and his family off. That is what narcissistic sociopaths do
@Chris11962 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Clinton put our nation's national security at risk! She's dangerous!!!
Except she didn't and you're lying. Into the basket.
Say It Ain't So seriously needs to put his crack pipe down!
Ah. Another of the poorly educated. No ability to construct an actual argument. Buhbye.
So off!
Presidents of the United States. Who is Donald Trump is my final answer.
AMEN President !! !!!!!
See? Trump has never fought for anyone's interests but his own – yet guys like you ignore reality to parrot bullshit like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAi7ttfyamg …
Donald Trump needs to apologize to you Mr. President for his racist Birther Movement.
It's already been proven that Hillary Clintons campaign started the "birther" movement! 
 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump
Nope it hasn't. It's been disproven.
Regardless, it doesn't matter, many ppl wonder if Obama is who he claims to be
Of course it doesn't matter. It's all a smear campaign to discredit the 1st Black president.
And what exactly has the 1st black prez done for African Americans?! NOTHING
PBO has done a lot for all Americans, He didn't just help one race.
He's screwed over every race in America just the same...
@realDonaldTrump    It won't be long.   And we can say.  Get lost. Jimmy Carter is a credit to this ... I can't even say it

@BarackObama We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.

"not one who writes off nearly half the country" Barack you must be referring to "Basket of deplorables?"Right

@realDonaldTrump brilliant!  Use his own words against himself and Hillary!  Go President Trump!
Let 45 have the WH & his criminal staff and W/E comes with it. Obama "IS" POSTERBOY OF REAL LEADERS, and is still unofficially guiding USA
Wish he were. IMHO USA is going to hell in a basket under the expert misguidance of Donnie boy, w/help from @GOP & friends. #FBR
@realDonaldTrump I agree!
@realDonaldTrump I would make a better president than trump and Hillary
MR. PRESIDENT YOU ARE SO RIGHT AND YOU RELEASED YOUR TAX RETURNS
@realDonaldTrump Donald for President. A Supporter of Christians.
You seriously are going to tell Americans what kind of President the Country needs? You are a delusional  out of touch imposter
@realDonaldTrump Barack. U suck sooo bad u Muslim oreo
But I thought you SUPPORTED Hillary?
@realDonaldTrump  yes and it's not the orange little hand man named trump ,!!
@DonnaM5050

Takes one to know one. 

.@BarackObama
You know @POTUS was talking about your deplorable dad when he tweeted this, right? Thank you for spreading the word
@realDonaldTrump Exactly! That's why we need @realDonaldTrump n NOT Hillary Clinton who only likes 1/2 the people
@realDonaldTrump hillary insulted every American that loves America , is proud of America and our flag, law n order
Does this mean our President FINALLY sees the TRUTH????
OMG, you agree TRUMP should be President YES!!  It was awful what Hillary said about American Citizens..you have seen the light
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Nothing but lies come out your mouth. TRUMP does a will fight for all Americans. Unlike Killary.
It would be GREAT to get a president that does NOT write off the whole country!
Damn, never thought I'd agree with Obama.
@realDonaldTrump 9/11 will seem like an itch compared to d epidemic dat USA will suffer if Hillary wins
BRING AMERICA BACK!!!
Good to know you're not voting for @HillaryClinton either.  First time I may ever have agreed with you.
Hillary was right some of Trump supporters  screaming horrible- name calling insults, don't know the issues.
@cindymannings great! That must mean you're supporting #STEINBARAKA2016  way to go @POTUS
. Nope
thanks just unfollow then
what am I missing here ? Don't get it
@realDonaldTrump Hillary will be a great President
In 2012, you edged Mitt Romney, permanently ending his presidential campaign.
what have u done? JV leader!! You r disgraceful!! Worst POTUS in HISTORY
@realDonaldTrump he meant not you #dirtydonald.  #ClintonKaine #imwithher
@realDonaldTrump Don't look now Trump, Obama isn't talking about you! #HillarysArmy #ImWithHer #TrumpLiesMatter
@realDonaldTrump Not to mention that if you keep showing off your worst of the worst fans, you can't get upset ppl noticed.
the stage has been set
you mean like Hillary did?  basket of.........
@realDonaldTrump You know he is talking about Hillary don't you Donald???
@husker_t 

Trump wants to put Muslims on a register. How do you rationalize that?
EXACTLY!

Thank you for the endorsement of @realDonaldTrump! (Since Hillary called half of his voters "deplorables")
And immigrants,future AMERICANS,TRUMP IS MADNESS!
@WendyLongNY exactly!  Like @HillaryClinton! We ARE NOT deplorable b/c we disagree with YOU and HER!
http://winningdemocrats.com/hours-after-911-attacks-trump-bragged-his-building-was-now-the-tallest-in-lower-manhattan-video/ …
Too bad he didn't

he continues to admonish/separate us!
@realDonaldTrump we can all agree
@realDonaldTrump That's a good find.
@D2243 not one that with these health issues legs don't work!
@hakana you are a Killer childiren
He's already written of the other half Mr President @BarackObama and he's now deconstructing the balance together with the Constitution
Finally an endorsement for @realDonaldTrump from the Islamic infiltrator Obama himself
@realDonaldTrump #BasketOfDeplorables All #Trump followers & family.
@KatrinaPierson Amen. @realDonaldTrump can do the JOB
What's Funny is Trump Gets More RT in 1 Day than this got in 4 years...Until Now. #MAGA
like Hillary did last night?
@realDonaldTrump 100 members of special forces. "basket of deplorables"
@realDonaldTrump like you say! #AmericaFirst and #AmericansFirst 
#MAGA
@realDonaldTrump You should talk! #DividerAndChief
I'm a deplorable according to Hillary so no
We DO NEED a President Trump who will be there for the real people and not just the elites and party connected
@realDonaldTrump I agree Sir
Half the country would be 156 million. She was talking about half the Trump supporters, which is only abt 6.5 million
6.5 M is 1/2 of his Primary voters. 1/2 of his supporters is 30 - 45M US citizens & voters.
All far short of 160 million.  And they are deplorable - in fact, she was generous, the real # is closer to 65%
#UCantFoolGOD #Usurper NOT @potus AKA @BarackObama YouWillStandB4GODSEternalThrone&LIEToGODReYourCrimes YouWillBeThrownIntoHellWSatanBy #GOD
@EricTrump you mean like HRC writing off us deplorables?

@realDonaldTrump He isn't writing off half the country, he has to fix your mistake for allowing people to just walk in, shame!
@realDonaldTrump So ironic! Love it! Go Trump!
Yes. When will you start?
- America needs a Presidents who closes all military bases abroad and dumps NATO.
That's why we are voting @realDonaldTrump
So that means we don't want to vote in anyone who continues in the divisiveness of your administration.
Same sickness as Hilliary. Cannot accept you are not president. Thank God you are not. You are a twitter troll, as is Hilliar.
so why you're really staying in DC to try to stir the pot...well it won't work!!  Patriots outnumber your pathetic anarchists
How much of your Russian bribe $$$ you burned through so far Barry?
@realDonaldTrump so we need trump than. Not Hillary!
@realDonaldTrump Agreed!
@CathyCecere We don't need this kind of candidate who pay for a Medical Diagnosis.

PUTIN PAID TRUMP 30 MILLION TO BUY A AMERICAN ELECTION
@realDonaldTrump yes we do that is why we need Hillary in the white house

U tell him Mr. President. Trump is not only incompetent to be President of the USA he is a total waster of skin and a racist
and that is either #BernieSanders or #JillNotHill
is your math bad? if she said "half of your supporters" that would be only 25% of country at best. Try math ok
so is this an apology? im confused
@barackobama Must it constantly be a fight? Plus youre the one who has passed inhumane bills which romney backs.
glad to see you are finally on the Trump train with the rest of us deplorables!
@realDonaldTrump HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE campaign. Divided the country.
DEPLORABLES.
CLASS!!
@realDonaldTrump Really? The whole country is voting for Drumpf? Possibly you learned math at his "university."
Are you talking about @realDonaldTrump or Hillary, who wrote off Trump's supporters?
RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
We agree. That's why we voted for Trump. Legacy of; bigotry hate cowardice lies perversion incompetence and treason
#Gitmo4BO
