Crooked T is vulgar, the idea that he could be President is vulgar. He brings nothing but a stripper…
but Hillary is dangerous, please read about her.  She is sick and dangerous.
No need to, I have studied Hillary long enough to know she is not dangerous. You keep him!
believe he realizes he can't do without us.  He needs us!

so how does building a wall between your country and another express this love of others?
love for ALL American citizens, how are you so blind?
That quote didn't say American citizens, it said 'all'. Your best president ever is Obama
He's becoming the US pres. not of Mexico. Pretty logical a pres. stands for their own people.
But i reckon people like you have no idea what a country means.
aren't you scared he'll start a nuclear war for no reason at all?
No, not at all. True, Trump's a loose cannon to say the least. But he doesn't stand alone.
She was a disgrace to her gender. #PhyllisSchafly
God ya
She had an opinion
Held fast to it
Became a leader for what she believed in
Survived winds of opposition
Disgrace
She thought a woman's place was totally in the home while she ran for Congress. Hypocrite.
Bullsh&t 
She never said women should stay home to death
She thought it was a good idea we raise our own children 
novel
If she insists.

@snopes That's what her entire life's work meant. You don't even know who she is do you?
Don't spread misinformation, it weakens your argument. Fight the good fight smarter, not harder.

"By getting married, the woman has consented to sex, and I don’t think you can call it rape.” – Sun Journal, 2007.
was probably @HillaryClinton that killed her
she had no respect for her own gender. Thats special.
#RIP Schlafy
She spent her life trying to keep women barefoot in the kitchen. That's despicable, not great. She mocked her own gender.
I wouldn't be proud of that endorsement! & once again turning a death to all about you.. #DropOut

May her soul rest in perfect peace.
.....we support you!  Save the mothership ( nation ) before we  can save the rest!
#haveavoiceusa
This woman has always md bad decisions.She was against women's rights. Where's surprise she made 1more by supporting Trump
She was horrid, hateful, backward, and a hypocrite. Of course she endorsed you.
That's one vote lost.
Homegrown Demagogue
she died because she supported the trash Donald Trump. It's God's will. This is the end result of supporting a liar: death
She saud spousal rape was A-OK and foight against equal rights for women. I can see why you thought she was truly great.
She hated LGBTQ & immigrants. She thought women shouldn't work. How "special" do you think she was?
Certainly special in the remedial sense.
Special in terms of excelling in hatred, perhaps? @realDonaldTrump
yes a woman who opposed women's rights @ECW05
thanks Donald for taking up our fight to make America great again you're a true American

Donald, will you eat healthy as POTUS? Disgusting diet!
fuckers a big mac away from a major coronary event. horrible example ...
We'd like to express our "thoughts & prayers" for your missing tax returns.
Remember the missing deleted emails from Hillary!
you are next president of America
Fitting, a male chauvinist like DT would speak at chauvinist Schlafly's funeral- She once said "a woman will be pres over..
You take compliments where ever you can get them, even from Putin. You entire team is made up of people who degrade woman.
What a childish thing to say. He’s entire team is made up of rapists, sexual harasser, child molester, and Extremists.

What is it you most admire about her, Don? Her notoriously rabid attempt to destroy women's rights?
Nah
I think he admires her tenacity to stand strong for what she believes in.
What? That's only ok if we think just like you do?
Always amusing when people answer questions to which they couldn't possibly know the answer.
You mean like you just did?
lol
Learn to comprehend.  Go to the gym if you need a fight.

thank you! I had the honor to intern for her in DC in 1984. Very tough boss, standards very high. Learned a lot.
she was a godly Christian woman.
