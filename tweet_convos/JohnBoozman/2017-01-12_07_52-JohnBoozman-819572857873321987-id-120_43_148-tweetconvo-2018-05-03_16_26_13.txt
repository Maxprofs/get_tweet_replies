Americans voted to change the status quo. Republicans heard that call and are ready to repeal and replace #Obamacare. 
@SenateGOP and your replacement is???? Talk is cheap, lay down your plan.
Fix it or replace it! Either way, you had 6 years and came with nothing! What a sack of useless losers the senate repubs are!
MORE MONEY FOR YOU??? YES! BUSTED
When is your term up. Hopefully people in Arkansas wake up and repeal you!
.@JohnBoozman @SenateGOP Cool story. What's your plan to replace it? How long will it take? All the American people see is the repeal part.
Just make sure y'all actually replace & do it at the same time.  Unfortunately,  Americans can't take your word for it anymore.
Sen. Boozman please pay attention.  If y'all don't replace this at the same time it'll be worse & we will vote you out
@SenateGOP Trump said ACA would be immediately replaced.  Are there pamphlets that outline the new programs?  How do I get one?
@SenateGOP I disagree and hope you'll consider its success in #Arkansas. I really hope you don't repeal w/o a solid plan.
@SenateGOP Sad 2 see you have not kept up on what happened in OUR home state w/ ACA: thousands newly covered, LOWER premiums!!
#Republicans tried for 6 yrs  to find a replacement so what is different now?The risk of #ACARepeal w/o replace is 2 high.
@SenateGOP HOW COULD YOU vote for these measures to repeal + take away key provisions of ACA without having a plan in place?
well show us these numbers I don't belive what u say because u say it.
U will kill Americans Selling out USA? What does Russia have on #trump? KNOW THEY HAVE THIS
If you are really pro-life, you need to take care of everyone out of the womb â–¬ that means affordable health care.
And you've tried to reach into women's bodies and take control of our decisions. #repealallpoliticians #yesallwomen
@SenateGOP how's California kept cost down?
and took cash out of the consumers hands!
.@JohnBoozman No, it is NOT time to repeal and replace. There are a few tweaks that could help, but rising costs due to insurance cos. #ACA
@SenateGOP just repeal, let the market replace
@SenateGOP
Replace WITH WHAT?
You've had 8 years. It's a simple question.
5000  $ deductibles will help no one but the rich.
It's beyond absurd to say ObamaCare has stifled job growth.  It is a failure for sure.  But cut the silly partisan hype.
no, it has given hope and healthcare to many who could not otherwise afford it. Repeal it will cost BILLIONS more than keeping.
No, the GOP's fascism defeated the public option, which drove up costs. It doesn't come from our budget. or taxes. Quit lying.
@SenateGOP lawmakers, please consider whether it's best to replace it or leave the govt out of the healthcare ins business
@SenateGOP so ur willing to repeal it and let 20mil Americans lose ins? Good luck in 2018 with that #MAGA
@SenateGOP too bad congress didn't fund it. You caused the failure.
@SenateGOP @SenateDems Let's see, 75 months straight job growth-helped 30 million ppl get Ins coverage, kept us out of DEPRESSION.  GOP LIES
@SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr Senator Arkansa ranks 48 in health in the country. Are you proud of that
@SenateGOP criminal
@SenateGOP So what are the replacement plans???  We are waiting...
@SenateGOP let Americans see the replacement before you repeal. If it's truly better, you have nothing to hide! #ACA #SaveACA
Why can't we have the same insurance plan you have?
@SenateGOP Our savings to keep a year,canceled us & told us to apply for Medicaid which we don't qualify for $2500mo!CROOKS
@SenateGOP 6 yrs of repeal votes and no new plan--had you done your job and improved the law vs obstructing, all would be good
@SenateGOP thanks for stealing my healthcare away in the midst of cancer with no replacement in sight.
.@JohnBoozman the ACA has improved access and lowered costs for 50 million disabled Americans - don't kill us by repealing it!
@SenateGOP as an Arkansan who has family members with affordable health insurance for the first time ever, pls have a plan.
do you have a plan or just going to leave people with nothing to fall back on
@SenateGOP replace then repeal
@SenateGOP people are gonna lose access to life saving medical care while you play blame game.
Do NOT repeal unless you have a replacement. You're going to take health care away from people who have no other way to get it.
@SenateGOP in a poor state like Arkansas you're gonna lose many votes.
these are all lies
@SenateGOP wait...but didn't @realDonaldTrump promise something cheaper with more coverage? Won't that be more expensive ?
replace with what? Where's your plan? I don't see it anywhere. Where's it hiding? Hello? Anyone?
yeah and instead of working with dems to improve you're going to take healthcare away from millions like me.
#americanfascist
.@JohnBoozman @SenateGOP so your plan not only fixes all these claims but also does not make any citizens lose healthcare?
@SenateGOP just remember the good with the bad
@SenateGOP it also help my low income family of 4 with two small premature babies get affordable coverage otherwise not offered
@SenateGOP you just voted to ax coverage for 20 million Americans. NO REPLACEMENT. You do all Americans a great disservice
You pulled the rug out from under 30 mil. & left them in medical & financial limbo. You don't understand what it means to serve
@SenateGOP out of touch elites.  Just what I want making decisions for Americans.
@SenateGOP lie. Not true! Where's replacement?never had plans to replace.lets take your coverage away!
https://youtu.be/DG5MfbXhnu4 
You don't even have a replacement! Do republicans take pleasure ripping  away healthcare from the sick and poor!
@SenateGOP  I feel like I am begging for my life here. Please don't take away my ability to afford health care.
@SenateGOP #SaveACA Stop C-level Multi-million dollar salaries! Millions can't afford #healthcare to line their bank accounts!
@SenateGOP Americans did not vote  to hurt Medicare Repealing ACA hurts Medicare
@SenateGOP Repealing ACA takes away preventative screenings 4 those on medicare
@SenateGOP Did you want me to help with that research? I've done a whole ton of reading. Repub lie!
@SenateGOP Repealing ACA lessens medicated solvency
@SenateGOP I Hope you folks are buying plenty of sympathy cards for the deaths you're about to cause
@SenateGOP Repealing ACA reopens donut hole
@SenateGOP Here you go John. Your state doesn't need health care.
@SenateGOP noone is talking about limits for doctors WTH
@SenateGOP That's a lie. Now you are lying like Trump. Do some research.
@SenateGOP it's a shame to label the affordable care act, after a individual, to win support of American people,then cry abt it
@SenateGOP vote for the ACA or I vote against you.
@SenateGOP y'all and the insurance industry fixed it to fail  from the start.
@senategop this is the GOP spewing disinformation to further the cause of the oigarchy while diminishing middle class.
It's in their nature!
ACA* has *given millions access to care, and *must be replaced (if it's repealed) due to basic human decency....Edited for you.
@SenateGOP mayb if you expanded Medicare& medicaid, enacted a single payer option & works w. POTUS this wldnt be the case
@SenateGOP 
I want my insurance that I loved back I want my premiums, deductibles and pharmacy back! Sick of dealing W/INS CO's
@SenateGOP Shame on you for petty politics at the risk of Anerican's health. Don't waste our $. Fix ACA, chng name & move on
@SenateGOP and saved lives.
@SenateGOP 

We already know that you care less about the ppl of Arkansas. Workers have zero rights

@SenateGOP fact would be GOP held back millions that was slated to be put towards the risk pool thus forcing insurers to leave
 @JohnBoozman is a bold face liar just like #Traitor #PutinsPuppet @realDonaldTrump living in Golden Penthouse! @SenateGOP
.@JohnBoozman .@SenateGOP Repeal w/o 1st trying to make it better? With NO plan to replace? Let's see how far being spiteful gets y'all!!!
@SenateGOP actually these are lies. Health care costs were estimated to rise and didn't reach the predicted levels.
Any American dying from lack of access to quality care is on your hands. Sleep well. May their souls haunt you 4ever

@SenateGOP every poll shows people want ACA.  Fix it, don't repeal it.  @SpeakerRyan @KARLIEREDD @JenGranholm @MIGOP
@SenateGOP So you're saying job growth under Obama would have been even higher?
How many of the 1% live in your State? Are you sure about that?  In states that embraced it, they are doing well and creating jobs.
Do you enjoy being a scurrilous lying sack of animal excrement? Inquiring minds want to know.
the status quo was republican obstruction not problems with BHO
Replace with what? This tweet seems to be missing the link of the details...
@SenateGOP  Just wait and enjoy the downfall 
@SenateGOP Fucking Lies!!!
It saved lives. Don't even pretend to be a Christian anymore jackass.
All false, and after years of harping on this you still have no replacement. What a disgrace.
@SenateGOP That incentive in your health plan contract rewards insurers for just abiding by contract. Repeal it instead.
@SenateGOP Where is "replace"? My pre-exist issues will no longer allow me to get insur. Why will repeal cost us billions?
@SenateGOP In the middle of night? Under cover of shame? I'm an Arkansan & you just dissolved my insurance coverage. Cowards
@SenateGOP Millions of dollars monthly to insurers to just process Fed Employee claims timely. FEBP, taxpayers pay. Repeal it.
