Sir, with respect, your thoughts and prayers are worthless unless Congress takes meaningful action to curb gun violence. DO SOMETHING.
His loyalty only cost @NRA $5,950 last year. If you write him a check for $5,951 you can buy his vote. Pretty cheap, huh?
NRA paid Arkansas @SenTomCotton almost $10,000 in 2014 election cycle. Boozman is a cheap date.
Makes me mad that they’ve sold themselves and the rest of us essentially have no voice.
Cotton doesn't even live in Arkansas. Hasn't for years. He is only using AR as a political stepping stone. His votes are self-serving.
I suspect that’s also why he joined the Army.
FB post from local activist fighting to save ACA all year. Her child diagnosed with cancer & died LAST MONTH. She just went to DC & met TC.
"Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle."
WaPo is showing $21,850 total for Boozman, $9,900 - @@SenTomCotton , $9500 - @rep_stevewomack , $7000 - @RepRickCrawford
Do you agree with @SenBobCorker? Will you stand up for your colleague? Your time is coming to be a patriot senator.
How does that $5,950 from the NRA feel now?
Oh your words are so believable
.@JohnBoozman maybe send back the $5,950 you got from the NRA while you're in the giving spirit!
WaPo reports $21,850 for Boozman
source: http://splinternews.com/every-member-of-congress-who-took-money-from-the-nra-an-1819059582 … (as far as I'm concerned any amount means he's complicit, but of course, I'd prefer to be accurate.)
Agree.  Thank you for fact checking.  This story from WaPo is circulating.
ah, I believe that number is TOTAL where mine is from the last election cycle.
Sad state of affairs either way.  Boozman takes first place.
Seriously, fuck you. Blood Money should be written on your grave. We all know that you don’t care so that makes you a liar.
Yo John we don't need your prayers we need your action. Stop taking $$ from @NRA and do your job to protect Americans. K, thanks.
That's so weird, I was praying that you were one of the people killed. Lol, maybe next time!
They only want an excuse to call in UN martial law... then all our right are gone... Republicans need to stand w President Trump!!
received $6000 from the NRA this election cycle. Bought and paid for.
Your "thoughts & prayers" are empty and meaningless. YOU accepted $5,950 from the NRA in 2016. There is blood on YOUR hands.
Do not let us down!!! No gun bans, feel free to build a wall. And a bigger prison...don't handicap the American citizen
Don't send prayers - give back the NRA $$s you accepted and support gun control
we need more than thoughts and prayers. We need #guncontrol now
Thoughts and prayers don't mean shit when you take $ from NRA and vote against gun laws
Outrageous.... Bans will only hurt the law abiding people.,,, cause those trying to shot us got their weapon from previous justice depart
Prayers r not enough anymore.  Do something about bump stock, semi automatics & people being able 2 have that amount of guns & ammo. Insane
Is this true? Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
Are you going to give back the money that the  NRA gave you?
Know what else would be heroic? Sponsoring gun-control legislation to prevent this from happening again. Throw off your NRA shackles. Please
perhaps in addition to your thoughts and prayers you could stop taking NRA $ and do your job and enact #guncontrol
Nobody wants your useless thoughts and prayers.
they call it blood money
Your NRA $$$ thoughts are meaningless #emptythoughtsfullpockets
.@JohnBoozman It's also tragic that you accepted $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
This went over well huh? Bet you don't do anything to change it. Time heals all wounds except those robbed of their loved ones. Sleep tight
The $5,950 u accepted from the NRA in 2016 is worth $102.59/victim. This is the “value” of your thoughts and prayers.
I think and pray daily for all victims of gun violence. Why don't you buy your balls back from the NRA and support sensible #GunControlNow ?
Thoughts and prayers are not enough!! Get the NRA out of politics! Be better than this, be American, not greedy!
Ur thoughts & prayers have saved 0 lives in mass shootings, John. donate your @NRA $$ to @Everytown
Time for gun control yet!?
You received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle. Thoughts and prayers won't cut it, do your job for your people

Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the #NRA during the last election cycle.
Apparently, your "price of freedom" is $5,950.  But, you weren't gunned down, so no big, right?
you and #ComradeTrump refusing to call the shooter a terrorist You are taking @NRA money The blood of the many are on your hands #guncontrol
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
Remorseful enough to support gun regulations?
i have a right not to get shot by an assault gun.
assault guns, large clips, no standard back ground checks, silence? People rights to own guns.what about my rights.
may you please also send the NRA their money back. or better yet donate it to save lives. thank you.
it is time to do something about these assault guns. I have guns but how many have to die. Help!
Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.

You took $5950 from the NRA last election cycle. Your prayers and thoughts aren’t wanted - your support of gun control is.
"thoughts and prayers" don't change things. Stop taking money from NRA and take action now.
Your thoughts and prayers are worthless when your actions are paid for in blood money.
And thank you for reducing the NRA's bank account by $5950.
There you go, homerun John! "thoughts and prayers" in the first 3 words. You got this, man!

Hey! Everyone! Boozman Thoughts and Prayers!
Thoughts and prayers while you take NRA $$ is heartless and corrupt. We see what you are. You are done.
Need less praying more action. Gun control legislation now!  People didn't vote for you to pray.  They voted for you to help keep them safe.
Save yr thoughts & prayers and DO YR JOB! We need common sense gun laws NOW! If u stop taking $$ from the NRA, maybe u wld pass some!
we pray for people like you to change laws. Our prayers go unanswered. #enough
Now do something. Like get those weapons off the street. Stop pandering to the NRA. #BloodMoney
Save it, Senator NRA!!!  Hopefully that stands for Not Relevant Anymore!!!!
Stop taking NRA money
You should at least thank those who helped you get here @NRA. Pray hard and wait for the check. They own you. Stay in line.
Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle. #thoughtsandprayersdontwork
$5,950
You took $5,950 from @NRA in the 2016 election cycle. Your thoughts/prayers ring hollow as false platitudes when you vote w/the gun lobby.
happily takes donations from the NRA, so your "thoughts and prayers" are rather hollow. The blood's on your hands.
We don't need your thoughts and prayers, we need action. 59 people are dead and you are 1 of 46 votes that contributed #SensibleGunLaws

Thoughts and prayers and higher stock prices for gun manufacturers.
Kinda cheap thoughts & prayers at only $5950! Since they keep getting bigger, maybe you should ask the NRA for more next time.
Yet you received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle. Stop praying and do something! Shameful hypocrite with blood on hands!
Sir, I’m sending my thoughts and prayers to Congress - as in, praying that you’ll finally get your rears in gear to address gun violence.

Hey look, John made Kimmel's show last night. He voted to make it easier for those with mental issues to buy guys.
There is more we can do, and we need to do it. Love to my hometown. #VegasStrong 
Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA
What did you spend your NRA blood money on? Just wondering what you got in exchange for these latest murders. #BloodOnYourHands
Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
How about if you stop praying long enough to pass sensible gun violence prevention legislation?! Then you could pray about something else.
the heroic action would be if you and rest of American Nazi Party would vote against NRA instead of for domestic terrorism
Are these prayers worth $5,950? That was the @NRA price. What price would you put on these lives Senator? #Shame #BloodIsOnYourHands
Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
Clearly your 'thoughts and prayers' don't work! Stop taking money from NRA and pass gun control legislation!
you took $5,950 from the NRA last election cycle. "words without thoughts never to heaven go."
You accepted $5,950 in campaign funds (aka, blood money) from @NRA during the 2016 cycle. Please shove your thoughts and prayers in your ass
Disassociate yourself from the @NRA and do it publicly
F*ck your thoughts and prayers. You took NRA money. The blood's on your hands.
So John how do you feel about the $21k the NRA gave you this year?
Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Change the gun laws.
You are a hypocrite.
Are you actually going to take any action against guns, or was the NRA's $6k enough for you to ignore gun violence?
John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
Your thoughts are hollow. Do something! Arkansas Senator John Boozeman received $5,950 from the NRA during the last election cycle.
Thoughts and prayers don't stop the next mass shooting #CommonSenseGunLaws do. Prove you care and stop taking NRA $$$. #ComplicitGop
