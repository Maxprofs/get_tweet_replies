Since 9/11, more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists
How do you sleep at night? Disgraceful.Your vote attacks my freedom to be safe. Blood is on your hands.
This hate crime made possible by Arkansas senators who voted to allow those under FBI surveillance possess assault rifles.
Except it wasn't engineered by ISIS; it was deranged guy on watch list with assault rifle that shld have been banned #Hypocrite
.@JohnBoozman Remember when you voted against a bill that would prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns? That helped the shooter.
Wait, the inquiries into him were closed, don't think he was considered a POI anymore, thus the bill wouldn't have stopped him.
Not trying to defend this senator, he appears to be an awful person, but you shouldn't make claims that aren't true.
was given over $24,618 in #BloodMoney from @NRA to continue supporting Domestic Terrorism, loves his wallet more than Citizens.
Who needs ISIS when we have politicians like you to help crazed American people get guns so easily? #hypocrite
You and your party helped cause this.
The guy decided he was an Islamic terrorist an hour into the killings, but ppl like u let him buy guns in the 10 yrs b4 that
start with fixing the laws to avoid arming them yourselves, perhaps?
this terrorism was your fault, you voted against HR 1076. Now's your chance to correct that mistake, stand with @ChrisMurphyCT
yet you voted to not protect gays from hate crime.
Your inaction led to these deaths.  #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
what about the freedom to live in a world without fear of potential terrorists owning guns? Walk down and ask a Q. #filibuster
In response to #Orlando, I hope @JohnBoozman will support background check options on the floor today supported by most gun owners. #arpx
We need leaders who will stand up to the NRA.
YOU VOTED AGAINST THE BILL THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT THIS MAN FROM BUYING WEAPONS!  SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
Hi @JohnBoozman why did u vote against blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists in Dec 2015? #ar #orlando #sa2910 http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00319 …
empty words when you voted to allow possible terrorist access to assault weapons. #Orlando @MomsDemand
As elected official who does the bidding of @NRA, you're accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Worth the price of your soul?
This isn't an ISIS issue. You have that on the brain.  This is a hate crime buy another AMERICAN who was allowed to buy gun
Stop yr ISIS B.S....YOU have fought LGBT rights + prioritized the NRA's agenda. Blood is on your hands.
this wasn't fucking isis
Senator, will we have that resolve before or after you spend the $25k the @NRA gave your campaign?
#NEVER
if only we had a legislative body that could pass laws against assault rifle purchase! The ... http://tmi.me/1feqVz 
Vote them all out in November
Fortunately, my Senatorial choices are both Democratic women! No Republican made it past primary.
Well that's the FIRST STEP TOWARD TAKING BACK CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER
Please do what majority of Americans want - vote for Feinstein and Murphy amendments!
Senator Boozman, by voting against background checks, you are responsible of their deaths.
you voted to let people on terrorist watch lists to purchase assault rifles. You're part of the problem. You are the problem.
As elected official who does bidding of @NRA, you're an accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Worth the price of your soul?
It was an attack on gay people. And you helped support it by voting against background checks for the commercial sale of guns.
your thoughts and prayers are killing us.Do something pass gun reform. Do you job cut the NRA strings and DO something
How about not letting guys like the shooter have easy access to guns? #BradyLaw2Now
You make the terrorists job easier when you don't ACT and #VoteForGunControl #InnocentLivesMatter #OrlandoNightclubShooting
But u took over $24,000 from NRA to see that this will continue. What is the red stuff on your hands?
No, it isn't. The biggest threat is the @GOP.
We must have the resolve to defeat the NRA. This isn't about ISIS. This is about bigotry and easy access to AR15s. Shame on you
you voted for it.
Your resolve is misplaced. Do your job as senator and create laws to protect our citizens. Stop fear-mongering; start acting.
.@JohnBoozman
Sen. John Boozman (R-AR) just said on radio that people don't use assault weapons to commit crimes b/c they are big and bulky.
We don't want or need your false sorrow. You took donations from the NRA to allow guns to flood our towns. This is on you.
Billionaires should donate money for missiles to carpet bomb #ISIS out of existence.
or start by doing your job and valuing your constituents lives more than money from the NRA. You belong in jail.
defeat ISIS? Maybe u shouldn't have voted AGAINST banning those on terror watch list from legally buying guns. #NRA $ bought u
vote him out!
You got $24,618 in expenditures from @NRA & voted against measure to stop terrorists from buying guns
Your voting to block background checks for gun purchases contributed to this tragedy.
You allowed this to happen. You voted to allow this man to have a gun.
You made it easier for them. Shame on you. How much was your soul worth?
Why did you oppose bill to bar terrorists from legally buy weapons?
YOU need to have the resolve to actually DO SOMETHING to stop this from happening again. Stop being a dog for the NRA.
This is not ISIS. These are Americans doing this. Try voting FOR gun control next time.
prevent known terrorists from getting guns.....YOU can do it.
But he WON'T do it
Until human life is genuinely (vs in prayers/words) valued > votes @NRA wl buy ppl like u as #mentallyunstable freely buy #guns
Shame on you! NRA has donated $29,900 to Arkansas congresspeople currently in office. http://washingtonpost.com/graphics/natio … #lovenothate
@JohnBoozman
It was a hate crime. Piss on your puke attitude.
and what about #homophobia? You refuse to acknowledge this reality! #checkyourhate
How about some resolve to stop being the NRA's puppet and address violence in this nation?
exactly Senator. Too many unscreened people enter our country, some from terror hot spots and everyone is confused about this.
.@JohnBoozman Yes that's true but we MUST MUST adopt sensible gun control & ban assault weapons
but keep taking that money from the @NRA    #bloodonyourhands
you're a terrible statesman for voting against gun legislation that would save lives. Please resign.
Should "suspected terrorists" also be locked up until proven innocent?
Defeat ISIS? You evil stooge. You mock the dead.
Your voting against stricter gun laws is what has caused this.
@JohnBoozman
We must vote against all GOP who block common sense gun legislation No excuse except for their fear of the #NRA
If I give you more money than the NRA does will you support measures to ban assault weapons?
u can't undo what you've done to afford shooters opportunities like this, so what r U going to do about it now? #prevent
Not a GOT DAMN THING ABOUT IT
if I donate (bribe) $25,000 will you do something about terrorists being able to buy guns legally (that's more than the NRA)
instead of scapegoating muslims why not do more to stop homophobia and the availability of guns?
You're an accomplice
Says the guy who takes money from the @NRA and votes not to ban terror suspects from buying guns. The creepiest of hypocrites.
Thoughts & Prayers are NOT enough.
NRA
really. we Arkansans don't hear crap out of u. u voted AGAINST background checks & against ban on assault rifles u make me sick
valuing NRA $$ over public safety makes you complicit in the death of every victim in Orlando. Do America a favor & resign.
i thought u said ppl dont use assault weapons bc they r big and bulky. Well?
#voteforguncontrol
stop voting for looser gun laws that enable terrorists like the one who legally bought his guns before committing this atrocity
oh John you may be a Senator but you're really a #gunslut
You helped block the bill that would have helped to prevent these tragedies because the NRA gave you lots of money.
Send the $24k you rec'd from the @NRA to the #Orlando families who lost loved ones in the #PulseShooting.
You really need to get out of DC are a two faced low life that does nothing to resolve America's problems!
.@JohnBoozman - or you could take a minute to resolve to change your 100% voting record with anti-LGBTQ @FRCdc?
Is this BUFFOON up for RE-ELECTION IN NOVEMBER WELL HE GONE
this kind of rhetoric is such an unproductive distraction.  I hope your constituents notice.  Not gov't by or for the people
This was NOT about Isis. His references to it were bullshit   It's about your group not passing REAL gun laws.
but assault weapons aren't a problem, right?
Sen. John Boozman (R-AR) just said on radio that people don't use assault weapons to commit crimes b/c they are big and bulky.
got $24,618 in from the @NRA & voted against measure to stop terrorists from buying guns.  Payoffs are so not cool Senator.
resign. You're responsible for this.
How to react to a mass murder spree? blame the terrorists you supply and fund. Stop US funding/supplying ISIS/Al Nusra now!
How about some "well-regulated" curbs on the "militia"? Like prevent domestic abusers, FBI watch-listers from getting AR-15s?
this is an access to gun issue. Insulting you cowardly pretend it's something else.
if only we had laws in place not to sell guns to Isis. That would be great.
the get the resolve to tell the NRA no and pass gun safety leg and national background checks
Didn't realize you were part of the LBGT community. When did you come out? Belated congratulations!
Did your contributions from the @NRA sway your vote against responsible gun control? 1 bought Senator
the resolve to not take NRA blood &? Or the resolve to do your job & pass common sense gun laws? #NRApaidforyourtweet
after reading your empty statement I need some booze, man
To put this in terms you might understand...The $ you accept from @NRA is your "30 pieces of silver". It's blood money.
. @JohnBoozman
Sen. John Boozman (R-AR) just said on radio that people don't use assault weapons to commit crimes b/c they are big and bulky.
end the #TerrorGap now.
not only a terrorist issue gun acess and your party promoting hatred against LGBT community for decades. #fakeassprayers
coming from the guy bought by NRA, ya I trust what you say
along with the NRA lobbying
Stop taking NRA's money ($25k) and at least try to regain some sort of semblance of dignity.
NO! It was an attack with guns on human beings. We must have the resolve to get #asshats  like you away from making policy.
How do you defeat an ideology - with a gun?
yeah, you seem to be aiding terrorism by not supporting gun control. You have blood on your hands.
This was a US citizen not some "foreign" agent. Why won't YOU acknowledge the role military weapons have on mass murders in US?
Y Is Media Ignoring .@SenTedCruz’s Embrace of ‘Kill the Gays’ Pastor? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelangelo-signorile/post_10496_b_8544540.html … … … Did U raise ur voice against @JohnBoozman?
how about defeating homophobia?
War against terrorism? How about better gun laws rather than burying more ppl?
No, it's an attack on the LGBT community. Don't make this about you. #DoYourJob and pass laws to prevent this shit.
save it senator! don't cherry pick shootings! to much lusting for guns and violence in this violent country.
Attack with a military rifle, by a US citizen, upon US citizens at a gay establishment. You refused to outlaw military weapons.
Remember when you said people don't use assault rifles to commit crimes? Your inaction means there's blood on your hands.
Too bad the NRA blood money you pocket will prevent any meaningful action from you.
.@JohnBoozman go wash your bloody hands now
Perhaps we should start protecting agsinst mass shooters here at home, Senator, and not with ISIS.
how do you propose we do that when you allow them to legally buy guns in our country? 50 ppl's lives were only worth $24.6k?
how about donating that NRA money to the victim's families or LGBT community?
Maybe another bundle of cash from the NRA will help you feel defeat ISIS.
How about we hear your plans on enacting some sensible gun laws? That will do far more to help stop these things from happening
stop taking money from the @NRA and pass sensible gun control. Like not allowing people on terrorist watch list to buy guns.
aahhhhh, MY Senator.....still cashing those fat NRA checks asshole?
= fraud
Here's a concept - make sure they can't get guns. You can't carry out intent w/o the instruments. #GunControl
You took $24K from the NRA. What would it take to buy your vote for sensible gun laws that would save lives, #gunsense
All you HAVE
When Gun control happens then prayers for victims has meaning. Or JUST pray to NRA for more money. Your God is NRA $$$$
does that include not selling automatic weapons to people? Because it certainly seems like that's part of the issue
Keep taking that Blood Money Senator From the NRA their blood soaks your hands
Lack of gun control is an attack on our "freedoms."
serious? take away our right & means to defense to stop terrorist ? ... blame the victim- got it
