@JohnBoozman  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@johnboozman Protecting 2A = knowing which weapons NOT 2 have available 2 general public; situational awareness my 1st defense 2 protect HM.
@JohnBoozman The only thing your protecting by allowing criminally insane people to buy guns is your #NRAbloodmoney.
#GunControlSavesLives
@JohnBoozman Yeah, ok. The style of gun/insane magazines were around when the 2nd Ammendment was written. U are an idiot.
@JohnBoozman the only thing you protected today was your own sad, soulless ass.
@JohnBoozman Thank you for supporting the 2nd Amendment and our rights as Americans!
@JohnBoozman you know 0% about the 2nd amed./constitutional jurisprudence. voting no on gun control enshrines you historically as a moron
@JohnBoozman received $4,950 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2010. http://ow.ly/kaLF0  #NRALapdogs

@Baronsquirrel @JohnBoozman Yep, I agree Chris.  No honor today for the 45 neighs.
@JohnBoozman Dead children don't vote. Nor contribute to campaigns. But I'm curious: Did it EVER occur to you to do the right thing today?

@JohnBoozman You didn't protect the 2nd Amendment; you chose the #NRA over the families of 20 dead children. How do you sleep at night? #p2
@JohnBoozman Protecting your backers in the gun lobby as well as criminals who can easily obtain guns. Shame on you.
@JohnBoozman Interesting wording: "Protecting 2nd Amend rights." What about protecting children. Guess they don't matter to you.
@JohnBoozman Who exactly were you elected to represent? Clearly not the 90%. Shame on you! I hope it was worth it!$$$$$
@JohnBoozman shame.
@JohnBoozman Re: No vote on extended  BG checks. You just spit on 90% of America.
@JohnBoozman You have failed the American people and your electorate. Shame on you.

@JohnBoozman #gunlobbywhore #liar

@JohnBoozman -Arkansas thanks you for supporting #2ndAmendment. This helps me protect my family and home and not use guns for criminal acts
@JohnBoozman as a concealed carry holding, law abiding citizen, how would today's bill have negatively impacted my rights as a gun owner?
@JohnBoozman Hope that line helps you sleep at night, because no one's buying it.
Never get my family's votes..shameful!!!“@JohnBoozman Protecting Second Amendment rights today on the Senate floor. http://1.usa.gov/100ItUA ”

@JohnBoozman disgusting.  If you have a clear background why worry? How many more violent acts will you allow to happen? #newtownbetrayed
@JohnBoozman As a voter in the state of Arkansas,  I appreciate your stance today voting against this bill.  You represent this voter well.
@JohnBoozman When do you plan to meet w the #Newtown families to explain your vote?
@JohnBoozman More like protecting the weapons manufacturer profits and using 2nd Amendment per AIPAC instructions
@JohnBoozman Your vote was truly sickening. Your thinking is completely twisted around.
@JohnBoozman Good job! Keep it up!
@JohnBoozman - who do you think you're fooling. We all know who you're protecting.
@JohnBoozman background checks don't take guns away, just a cautious step.  You put money and power above your constituents today
.@JohnBoozman a more appropriate bio. is "representing corporations such as the @NRA in the U.S. senate"
@Taltool11 @JohnBoozman @NRA Boozman is owned by Walmart...if you ever went to his town hall he is dumb as a stump. True backbencher.
