@JohnBoozman thank you for fighting Obamacare and for standing up to blowhard Ted Cruz
@Eeindc @JohnBoozman Ted Cruz is fighting Obamacare too. why do u call him blowhard? He's standing on principle while knowing he may lose.
@TruthBToldDe Cruz's main concern is getting as much attention for himself as possible.  His request to delay vote till today revealed that.
@Eeindc Cruz's goal: attention to the perils of Obamacare.
 Rinos don't like him b/c he is standing w/ American ppl and keeping his word.
Not if You Vote for #Cloture @JohnBoozman  Tired of the #Games! #VoteNOOnCloture #DefundObamacare  #StandwithCruz @catsim7 @GOP @JohnCornyn
@JohnBoozman The time has come to employ the CHECKS & BALANCES given to us by our Founding Fathers and let the chips fall where they may.
@JohnBoozman @NuAgePatriot thank you sir for listening to the people! We don't want Obamacare
@JohnBoozman @SnakebiteJones which means what? Allow cloture and Reid will strip defunding so you will support the funding of #Obamacare
@JohnBoozman @InGodIDoTrust kudos to you Senator.  Now stand your ground #tcot
@JohnBoozman Then, why did you vote FOR cloture????
@JohnBoozman Will you vote for the bill if the the amendment clause to strip the bill of the defund language is added?
@JohnBoozman A vote 4 cloture is vote to fund #ObamaCare. Vote no on cloture so Reid doesn’t strip defunding provision. Rest of govt funds.
@JohnBoozman thanks for blowing it Boozman. You know what Mr. Reid is up too and you wouldn't back Cruz. Thumbs down to you.
@JohnBoozman Thank you!
@JohnBoozman also vote NO on cloture, The people are depending on you!
@JohnBoozman The wrong side of yet another issue, huh? You're building quite the record.
@JohnBoozman You would be better served to get behind ACA and explain how it will help people in Arkansas. Never mind, you're too STUPID.
@JohnBoozman How can you say you appreciate them when you found it necessary to put Cruz in his place? Hope he never listens to you!
@JohnBoozman The ignorance of the GOP continues to astound.
Thank you to @JohnBoozman for taking a stand for America and supporting the bill to #DefundObamacare !!
@JohnBoozman I am a twitter follower because of your conservative views. But you should NEVER make a fellow conservative look bad in any way
@JohnBoozman Then why did you lay into Ted Cruz in a closed door meeting? Perhaps to embarrass and degrade him in the eyes of your "buddies"
@JohnBoozman What about the cloture vote?  That's what I called your office about. #MakeDCListen
@JohnBoozman @corrcomm THANK YOU. Make sure @SenPatToomey follows suit, please.
@JohnBoozman Thank you.
@JohnBoozman ......but, will you vote NO on closure?
@JohnBoozman that's Linda vague are supporting #Cloture or are you voting against Cloture
@JohnBoozman @InGodIDoTrust What about the cloture vote??????
@JohnBoozman @thetalentscout @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn 
Thank you for supporting the House-passed bill that defunds!
@JohnBoozman @RepTomCotton no one is surprised about that!
@JohnBoozman The question is whether you will vote NO on cloture for the bill. We understand a YES vote there is a vote FOR funding ACA.
@JohnBoozman @g_makay If you support it it allows Reid to call for a 51 sen vote to amend it and put funding back into it. Dont vote for it
@JohnBoozman A vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare. Nice try RINO.
@JohnBoozman @Limrintz Without any amendments from Reid, right?!
@JohnBoozman By voting for it you will be helping fund Obamacare. Tell me how that is not the truth, Senator?
@JohnBoozman Thank You!
@JohnBoozman Thank you for standing up and firm on this. From Bentonville, 3 yr unemployed professional w/ 2 kids in private colleges.
@JohnBoozman thank you!
“@JohnBoozman: Appreciate the calls & comments from Arkansans. I will be supporting the House-passed bill that defunds #Obamacare. @tedcruz
@JohnBoozman @RepTomCotton Thank you
@JohnBoozman why don't you just vote for the thing and stop throwing rocks at Ted.
@JohnBoozman @DwyerEllen  non sense ....a vote for cloture is a vote aginst the will of people
@JohnBoozman thank u now get Pryor on our side!!
@JohnBoozman @RepTomCotton  Thank you.
@JohnBoozman really?? then answer for this http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/john-boozman-ted-cruz-obamacare-97339.html#.UkMODYUro5s.twitter …
@JohnBoozman @RepTomCotton will you vote no on cloture to prevent simple 51 vote to remove ObamaCare defunding.
@JohnBoozman @Witty_Witticist Gads can you give it a rest already?  No wonder nothing gets done anymore.
.@JohnBoozman GOOD. But Lay off @SenTedCruz He has the courage to stand & speak for US! http://weaselzippers.us/2013/09/25/gop-sen-john-boozman-sides-with-out-of-state-leftists-calling-his-office-to-complain-about-defunding-obamacare-stands-up-and-yells-at-ted-cruz/ … #MakeDCListen #IStandWithCruz
@JohnBoozman thank you!!!
@JohnBoozman Thank you for standing with conservatives! Obamacare is a job-killer.
@JohnBoozman Question from a longtime supporter, will you vote against cloture?
@JohnBoozman So proud to hear you are supporting the defunding of Obamacare.    stand tall with Arkansans!  for America!
He berated #TedCruz but supports the overall concept “@JohnBoozman: I will be supporting the House-passed bill that defunds #Obamacare."
@JohnBoozman Sounds like you’re more interested in getting reelected than doing what’s best. Threatening gov’t shutdown is not the answer.
@JohnBoozman vote NO to cloture #MakeDCListen
@JohnBoozman With all do respect...is that a vote for or against cloture?
@JohnBoozman ..then can we be assured u will vote NO to cloture???? Otherwise, u r voting for Obamacare.
@JohnBoozman vote no on cloture! Join @SenTedCruz
@JohnBoozman But will you back Cruz or our you just another drone for the GOP establishment?
@JohnBoozman But Sir will you vote against cloture? If you vote for cloture you will be voting for #Obamacare Don't vote with Harry Reid!
@JohnBoozman please vote no on cloture do not allow the democratic contolled senate to stip out the defunding of Obamacare from the CR
@JohnBoozman Glad to hear that.
