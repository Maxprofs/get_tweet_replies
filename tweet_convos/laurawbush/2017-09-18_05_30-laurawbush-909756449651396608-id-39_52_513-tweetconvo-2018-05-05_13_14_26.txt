Great interview today.  Always admired her, her husband & her family.  God Bless them all.
Laura, my beloved Mother “passed away” yesterday, April 21, 2018 at 9:30am. If anyone, just like Barbara, deserves a place in Heaven it’s my Mother, Janice Kendle!!
Laura Bush looking beautiful, as always!
Laura Bush is a class act. She looks great. Love our first ladies.
I'm a Laura Bush fan. Both George and George W married well
Always liked her. Very genuine & classy lady.
You look amazing Mrs. Bush 
First class First Lady

You look marvelous! Love seeing you in the media.  I hope you and Former President are doing well.  We miss you.
Laura the Librarian.   Great hook for a new musical.   I'd love it.
I like the Bush's but I hate to see them hanging out with the satanic CBS.
Laura Bush, you are beautiful and I've always thought so your heart is full of love. Thank you for sharing your faith and life.
Absolutely LOVE your Tartan dress Mrs. Bush. You look beautiful as always. Are you an @Outlander_STARZ fan by chance? 
Miss you grace and class in the White House!
Sorry I missed it @laurawbush I don't watch CBS in the am
Laura,get away from those far left liberal reporters !
Your husband is one lucky man to have such a beautiful woman
I would have watched , but @ColsDispatch has pulled @10TV from @DIRECTV ... holding them hostage over free tv..

Just love Mrs. Bush. She seems to be a genuinely kind individual.
...Happy Bday
