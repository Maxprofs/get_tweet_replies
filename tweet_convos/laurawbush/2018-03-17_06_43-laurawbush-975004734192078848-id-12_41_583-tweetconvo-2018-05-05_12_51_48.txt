We recently visited the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in NYC.  I will always think of President GWB and how proud I was of him!  Can’t wait to come to Dallas and visit the Bush Center!

Ma’am, hopefully we can make it to Dallas. We’ve been to Ronald Reagan’s library & it would only be fitting if we went to yours too. V\R, retired SCPO Jude Morgan, USN
Thank you! Same to you and #43!
Happy St Patrick’s day to you too, all the way from the Emerald Isle. 
Enjoy your day and hope you find a four leaf clover!
Happy weekend. Smiles!
One of my favorite places to wander. 
Would love to tour sometime.  Have a blessed day to you and Mr. Bush.
Happy St. Patrick's Day!
