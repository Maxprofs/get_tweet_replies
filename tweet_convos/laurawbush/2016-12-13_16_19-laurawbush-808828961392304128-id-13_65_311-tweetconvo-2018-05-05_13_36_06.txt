It's shameful you and the 2 former presidents aren't grown up enough to attend the innaguration, how childish
happy kids with Laura Bush
In the interest of our Nation, all able bodied former Presidents should be present for inauguration. Period.
Mrs. Laura Bush; I greatly admire you and enjoyed reading your biography of your charity work in women's issues
Was she licking her lips in anticipation of her next meal?
the harts you have wormed the faces you make smile will never forget you and your parents
