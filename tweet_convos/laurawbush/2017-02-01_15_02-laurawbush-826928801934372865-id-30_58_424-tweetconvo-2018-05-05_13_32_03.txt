This month, we have former First Lady Laura Bush on the Texas Parks and Wildlife podcast! http://ow.ly/CGgx308xYX5  
AH! Dont #CRY @laurawbush @TPWFoundation  UR INVOLVEMENT IN THE 911 #TWINTOWERS IS ABOUT #THE #PRESIDENT AND HIS #GODDAMNED #BROTHER
mrs. Bush now I have this guy that was involved with that oral copulation School that was going on  Baldwin Park
I have a great love for your Husband. I don't want him to feel ridiculed. We all did a great job insuring the
safety of the US. A job that he should be proud of because I'm very proud of it. President Obama failed all of us
President Obama can never say that we didn't do a good job. I'm not going to allow these Mexicans to ruin our
Nation. Make America great again is it about white brown green yellow it's about being American. How much do you
love this nation? Do you love this nation enough to go through a process the immigration set forth or do you
cry along with everybody else it says that we are being prejudicial? They are breaking the law for that we need

all respect & warmest of wishes to a classy Lady who once graced the White House!
supportive of our new Republican President.  That would be helpful.  Thank you with much respect.
Mrs. Bush, we have great respect for you and President G.W. Bush, but please speak to him about being more
Owl in flight, get your house right
