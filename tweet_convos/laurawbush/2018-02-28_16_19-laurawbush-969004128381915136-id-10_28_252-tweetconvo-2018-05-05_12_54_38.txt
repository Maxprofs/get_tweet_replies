G.W. completely and totally out of touch with the American people. Trump is magnificent, no comparison to any Bush.
I'd really hope you extend a hand to Melania Trump and invite her to be a part of that as she is the prettiest and best dressed first lady we have.


Maybe you can apologize for your classless husband's ignorant remarks about President Trump who is working hard to abolish years of corruption, human trafficking, organ harvesting, illegal arms and drug sales that your husband never noticed?!
