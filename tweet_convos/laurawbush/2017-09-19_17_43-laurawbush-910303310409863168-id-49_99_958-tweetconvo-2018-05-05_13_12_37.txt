Like Melania Trump, Laura Bush was a wonderful first lady. She remains a wonderful lady to this day.
You just stay gorgeous don't you?!
Beautiful!
You look so beautiful!  I have been seeing these butterflies a lot more lately.
Mrs. Bush how long has people been making fun of my leg's for? For some reason people think I'm and bothered by there little remarks? If
Seriously think it bothers me then you are completely lost. In fact it pushes me to do well in other places. They have a whole different
Rule book when you comes to me. You have to treat me a certain way you can't smile around me you can't talk to me like you would everybody.
Mrs. Bush, thank YOU for helping restore the population of these beautiful creatures. You are a wonderful lady!
I'm actually doing the minimum here. However. Look. It's closing doors. It's real.
"hello laura bush how are you
