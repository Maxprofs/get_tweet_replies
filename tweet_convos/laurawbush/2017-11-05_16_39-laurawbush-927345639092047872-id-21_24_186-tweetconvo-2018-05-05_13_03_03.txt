I used to hold such respect for what I thought was the manliest of all presidents...until he lowered himself to the verbal garbage.
I knew that the older George is dumb looking! Out of O2 to long?? Brain Dead????But GW wasn’t he just is mad cause we were tired of the same old thing! Didn’t want his Brother!MAGA#TRUMPTRAIN #Ibleeddodgerblue 
Laura why did u allow George to write that terrible book about trump. Why sell your soul to the Clintons.
How could W & HW put money bf country. Bill Bennett says u r so inappropriate! Laura why do you allow that!
So many ppl criticism of your book.@ hope u feel rotten when u run all over promoting the dumb book sorry I ever voted for u.

How wonderful it is to see these two sisters.  Mrs. Bush (Laura) I know you and the President must b ever so proud.  I've caught a few of their interviews about he book and enjoyed each and every one.
PLEASE stop defending Bush senior.
His behavior was and is DISGUSTING.

Cannot express how disappointed I am with the whole bush clan
Laura tell your stupid Husband that I bought his book with the paintings! I LIKE AND RESPECT OUR PRESIDENT! Tell him, his brother didn’t win we were sick of the BUSHES, HATE HILLARY ,POTUS & FLOTUS!LA DODGERS!
Loved watching the interview tonight! Can’t wait to read the book
You and your girls helping the Obamas ease into the WH is all I need to know about your family’s kindness and goodness.

This explains why George W. Bush (43) was Chosen as the Supreme Winner!
