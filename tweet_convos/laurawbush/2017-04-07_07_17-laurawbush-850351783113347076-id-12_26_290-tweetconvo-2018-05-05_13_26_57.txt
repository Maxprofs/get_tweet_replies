Question any of you? You're holding me as property that's intimidation like if you were gang members? Because I made mistakes it's okay?
In other words how does it feel? The president of the United States is acting like a little punk from the street? You know what that feels
That I wouldn't want to know what was going on? No that's just sorry ass s*** that I wouldn't expect from our president the US doesn't
Deserve to be treated in this fashion regardless of what they've done. Then to attempt to murder me?
To steal money from me. All of you called me a rat a a snitch a punk low life I didn't even know your husband for him to see these things
About me it was all about the money. I considered him a friend just like I considered everybody else friends but not one of them stood by me
@JennaBushHager @JebBush Hard to believe but @NancyPelosi just said she wished George W was back in the @WhiteHouse
