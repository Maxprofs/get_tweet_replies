Please take the reins and save us from #DeplorableTrump!  I am afraid for our children!!
Been looking at the Bush family history. Looks like they were in cahoots with the Nazis.
- Laura Bush attends an important forum & tweets nothing, Michelle Obama wears fingers out
You and your family need to endorse Hilary before Trump ruins our country!
I'm a life long Democrat Laura but always thought you were a wonderful First Lady. Bless
