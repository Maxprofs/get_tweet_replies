@laurawbush all your husband did was use terrorism
you know how embarrassed my girlfriend is? You know that using it as an excuse to pull the crap that's going on
but I had to ensure that no other American Getty king cobra used on them again. I guess changing your history
means that you guys had the king cobra in mind for quite some time. Barack Obama Hillary Clinton all those
low lifes who assisted you trust me it's not over there is no way in hell your husband's going to get away with
this. I'm still going to go to the United Nations I'm sure international law is violated
you tell that pussy of a husband you have when he's man enough to face me he knows where to find me
make a deal out of my history they stick a dirty needle in me and Drug me your office was notified
@laurawbush about the war on terror you don't care about your friends tell me about yourself. Our nation needed a leader
Happy Birthday Mr. President May this be  your best year ever ! and here is to many more Birthdays to come God Bless xoxo
