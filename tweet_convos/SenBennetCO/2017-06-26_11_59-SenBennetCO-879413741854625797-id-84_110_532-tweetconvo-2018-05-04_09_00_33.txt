GOP #healthcarebill threatens insurance for the 171913 CO women who gained coverage B/C of the ACA #SaveHerCare @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner
Stop resisting Bennet! You're a disgrace to Colorado! You will be replaced in 2018. #MAGA
Thank you!  Women's care makes a difference to EVERYONE. Perhaps you can pass on this message to @SenCoryGardner ?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! @SenBennetCO. Sincerely, #aColoradoanWithADisability
Thank you @SenBennetCO. @SenCoryGardner what is your stand?
More Lies Bennet! Bill does not make access more difficult! Does require more to fund their own insurance needs.Anyone can access healthcare
Thank you, but it won't matter, the Rep. are pulling a con game. They will all support this as a heath bill, in reality it is a tax bill.
Thank you! What can you do to protect and improve the #ACA ?
Thank you senator!!!
After supporting & lying about the disastrous NObamacare, you have zero credibility. #fakenews
Thank you @SenBennetCO
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Thanks for voting no and we need you to filibuster by amendment! #TrumpCareKills #Resist
#partisanhack. No interest in solving the disaster aka #obamacare. Just wants to bitch
#SaveTheACA and save us from #TrumpCare v2.0 with more bugs in it than its previous version.
Will you support single payer?
Thank you Senator Bennet. This bill is bad for Colorado and bad for America.
As any reasonable person with a vote would do. Thx for being the reasonable CO Senator. Not one of the ones that crafted this offense
Now to work on @SenCoryGardner....
Thank you Senator Bennet.
It doesn't threaten coverage for anyone-and defunds planned parenthood-who donated 740,000 to a Dem campaign, and made a 100mil profit
Thank you
I am committed to voting against you in your next election.  #commonsense
Thank you!
Thanks for caring about your constituents, Sen. Bennett, unlike your Republican colleagues.
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Bennet.  please help lead the rest
Thank you for standing up for us!
Thank you, Senator!
Tell Gardner to do the same. Vote NO!
Senator Bennett thank you for your No vote
Stop this bill. All means necessary.
Thank you!!
Thank you
Thanks for staying strong. No on Health Care Bill.
Thank you!!! #NoAHCA
Thank you for being the one Senator from CO with a brain that can recognize complete and utter stupidity by Repubs
A no vote is a vote for the continued failure of Obamacare.
Thank you, Senator!
THANK YOU!!
Thank you, Senator. Can you convince @SenCoryGardner to do the same? I am tired of being punished for being a woman.
Yep I'm all favor of #Dems sticking to failing #Obamacare.   Obvious they won't work to cure its ills. #obstruction. #2018
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you @SenBennetCO for standing strong to #ProtectOurCare Coloradans appreciate your leadership & willingness to meet w constituents
Work the Byrd rule
Thank you @SenBennetCO ! @SenCoryGardner where is your statement of commitment?
Thank you, Senator. Please do all you can to stop this #HealthcareBill from getting to a vote! #VoicesofColorado #BRCA #KilltheBill
Thank you for working for your constituents.
Thank you, @SenBennetCO!!!!
Thank you Senator!
Great start + very appreciated. Can you also tell us about your positive proposals that move the US toward universal comprehensive coverage?
Thank you, Sir!!!! Colorado is grateful to have you in this fight for us.
What about us poor dumb working folks that can't afford the worthless insurance we have now? Premium government insured Elitists!
Thank you! If you see @SenCoryGardner maybe you can take him to see the wizard for some heart & courage to do the same. #FirstDoNoHarm
Will @SenCoryGardner join your No, is Koch $400M enough to buy him off??
Thank you. Now could you find it in your heart to talk some sense into the Jr. Senator from Colorado? @SenatorGardner
Get ur boy @SenCoryGardner to vote no as well! It matters to Colorado!!! #VoteNoOnTrumpCare #AHCA #Resist
Thank you Mr. Bennet. Could you please talk some sense into Gardner?
Of course you're voting no. You're a bought-and-paid-for Democrat, whose seat was clearly bought by massive national DEM money ~7 yrs ago.
Thank you for committing to vote NO. Continuing to urge @SenCoryGardner to do the same.
Good that you're voting no because anything less than universal Medicare For All is unacceptable.
Thank you!!!
But you did vote for ACA, and have chosen to do nothing to fix its flaws.
That's not true! GOP said they wouldn't "fix" only wanted "repeal", that's not fixing ACA. @SenBennetCO
Thank you Senator.  I hope @SenCoryGardner follows your wise and good example.
Yes. We expect you to be against this. Drag Gardner into a closet and explain what he's doing to his constituents,  please.
That's good, Senatorâ€¦ do you ever talk to Sen. Gardner? Why is he not one of the GOP who stands with his constituency against this travesty?
Thank you! Called your office at the same time this tweet was posted to ask you to vote no. Glad you represent us!
How about your colleague, @SenCoryGardner ?
Thank you for voting no, can you talk to @SenCoryGardner to help him understand the effect this bill will have.
Thank you, Senator! Can you talk to your colleague @SenCoryGardner ? ACA repeal will harm my family and my small biz (80422)
