Thanks For Standing Up For US! @SenBennetCO! Don't let the idiot @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaNaziAgain.

Thank God you have some sense. Thank you! (I am a constituent.)
Hey @SenBennetCO, can you ask @SenCoryGardner what he thinks of a Constitution change in CO to allow for his #Recall in 2018?

2) and my grandmother, die hard Repubican, cannot wrap her head around the minds of Trump and Republican Party.
. @SenBennetCO I know you would have voted No on Sessions anyway but thanks so much for hearing us and bringing our voices to the senate!
1) Sir, you seem to be a real standup guy. I truly believe you are not voting your party. These cabinet choices are poor
Thank you for hearing your constituents. I'm saddened by @SenCoryGardner ignoring our voices. I am so discouraged.
thank you for standing up for Coloradans! Unlike your colleague @SenCoryGardner #ShePersists #Resist
thank you for representing Colorado.
thank you. Please tell us if you have any ideas how we can get rid of Cory before 2020.
@SenCoryGardner here is what a true supporter of Colorado looks like. You should be ashamed. So how much did trump buy u for?
Thank you for fighting for Coloradoans!! We need you to keep being our voice of good and all things sane at this time #grateful
Thank you for standing up for Coloradans and all Americans.

Tell it like it is.....you voted against Senator Sessions because you're a Democrat.
thank you
Thank you!!!  You truly represent Coloradans
Thank you!
Thank You! At least CO has 1 Sen who listens to constituents & reason. Unlike @SenCoryGardner who is the real #paidprotester.
thank you.
@ColoradoNurses TXU 4 Ur vote!

thank you for your vote, and for listening to us in Colorado!!!
Thank you Senator for listening to and working for the people you represent in Colorado.

thank you
THANK YOU

Thank you for voting no. Please vote no on Pruitt.
Thank you for standing up for our values!
Thank you. It is lovely to know that an elected official is for us.
thank you for your NO vote. Jeff Sessions is too racist to be the AG. Or at least he should be.
Hes done a better job than you.
Do not speak for all Coloradoans.  You voted no because your a line toting Dem.  Please help with Gorsuch and be your own man.
Thank you for standing up for us!

thank you for your good work.
How is it clear he hasn't earned our confidence...just making stuff up to defend your ceaseless mucking around in the swamp?
Thank you @SenBennetCO
you've turned into a political hack. Too bad.
thank you!
What a shock. You voted with the crazy left. Again and always.
Thank you for voting your conscience and ours!
Is there anyway you could talk some sense into Cory Gardner?
Thank you. So if the new AG will not, who WILL protect  what rights we still have??
thank you senator. Too bad we could get more to see how bad he is.
Thank you, @SenBennetCO! Keep fighting against the hateful, regressive people & policies Trump puts forward. Colorado is counting on you!
thank you.
Thank you again. Price isn't a good candidate, so you'll need to be ready with your arguments. You have strong support at home
You also confirmed your lack of support for CO. Typical liberal BS. RESIGN and take @RepDianaDeGette with you
thank you for listening!
Thank you. Proud of one of my senators.
Thank you for listening.
