.@SenCoryGardner You vote yes in this and you lose BIG in 2020
So you would prefer Americans to have higher premiums, deductibles that will never be reached and the middle class to become poorer.
And yet Gardner is okay with that. What is wrong with him?
Thank you,  called Gardner this morning. Not sure he even cares. Keep fighting.
Could you let @SenCoryGardner know? He says he’s undecided.
Undecided. 
They lose 78B that was never funded and an affordable.
Sad you let us depend some much on the federal government OR  maybe from your perspective the federal government should run everything.
We can hold a lottery and sell tickets to "pick a politician " and kick his/ her ass" air it on pay preview and watch the fun! Billions made
Hey @SenBennetCO, pls tell this to @SenCoryGardner I hear he's looking for more info before deciding how to vote. Maybe you can educate him.
And let's get going on single payer plan....oh wait, you can't give up the $ coming in from health insurers!  Darn!
@SenCoryGardner must not support this plan. It is clearly bad for CO and for all Americans.
@SenCoryGardner thank you senator Bennett for the link to analysis of new bill. Bad news for Colorado
Thank you @SenBennetCO for standing up for #Colorado. Small biz owners need #ACA. Please do what you can to stop #GrahamCassidy
Disagree. This hurts small business
@SenCoryGardner you know @SenBennetCO. You can trust his word on this horrible bill.
Deport illegals and we will save $113 billion
@SenCoryGardner this is a bad bill just like the others VOTE NO
STOP Them!!
You down with that, @cologop ?
Bennet is just afraid Dems will lose control of your health care and you won't have to grovel at their feet any more. Drain the fetid swamp!
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/910526144285470721 … (Ranked 2nd for Sep 20.)
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS CRUEL BILL EXCEPT TO KILL PEOPLE AND FILL POCKETS OF MEGA-MAGA???
Keep fighting!!! Shame on @GOP.
and my husband, just finished radiation at 64 yrs and me, with RA and nearly 60, may never be able to retire. Ready to join dem. party.
Hey @SenCoryGardner Where do you stand on #GrahamCassidy? You really feel like penalizing Coloradans? How would you explain it to your kids?
Good! Now maybe that's how much money is saved by not going through Fed's  grabbing hands in the first place!
You don't have a clue what the healthcare bill does do u?
Be sure u tell sen Gardner and remind him that we won't forget his vote
We need Medicare for all.
@realDonaldTrump says it will save States money??? @SenCoryGardner - show where your allegiance lies (pun intended).
Thank you, @SenBennetCO for fighting for health care for your Colorado constituents!
Does your colleague @SenCoryGardner know or care about this? Or about his constituents in CO?
What is your alternative Bennett?  Stay with o care which u supported.
Don't overlook Zinke's plan to harm our national parks. How do we stop this?
Senator Bennet, please stand up to the hateful republicans in congress. Keep fighting for Colorado.
Bad bill and back room politics where scoundrels hide
Please do not allow this bill to pass.
It's is legislation written in secret and rushed to vote.  No discussion and discourse with public
Thanks for your leadership in this area.  Hopefully @SenCoryGardner will do the right thing & vote no on this bill.
Vote No
Fight em...try for bipartisan bill...better yet pass Bernie's Medicare for all...we need mid life Dentistry covered too
I'm thinkin'.....mike.......that fed govt will save $78B......and that is just for 1 state!
@SenCoryGardner Please don't vote for this bill.
Keep Fighting!! Fighting right there with you, Senator!!
@SenCoryGardner Sooo if #Colorado loses $78 billion how will you explain to Coloradans that this #CassidyGraham bill is good for us? #VoteNo
Please tell @SenCoryGardner this.
Please send this message to @SenCoryGardner He can't add or read, but he might respond to $$. Taking $ away from own state of CO is stupid
This is nothing more than moral cowardice by those who support it.  Instead, come up with better ideas!  Here's one:
Hey @SenCoryGardner are you listening? #healthcare @GovofCO
Including my brother who will not be able to afford his anti-virls.
@SenCoryGardner this is an unacceptable future for CO and the most vulnerable here - Vote NO
It will #maga! Take illegals off Medicaid. Hopefully they'll go back to their own country. People will have to pay for their own insurance
It's not illegal residents that will lose care. It's severely handicapped children and adults who need that money just to survive.
And FYI, I have an autoimmune disease, narcolepsy, so my surcharge for insurance will be $26,580. This bill screws EVERYONE!
@SenCoryGardner is this acceptable to you?
Please fight this like Hell Sir. Coloradans deserve better than to have their healthcare stripped away for tax cuts to wealthy. Thank you!
If this happens, let's reallocate some of our marijuana taxes and give free healthcare to every Coloradan.
Not nearly enough for that.
if we deports few hundred thousand #illegals (aka Dem constituents) in #Colorado, we could find a huge cost savings there! #COpolitics
Didn't the playbook from your DEM puppet-masters include using the word 'children'? They/you must be slipping.
Have you told Senator Gardner? He's not listening to his constituents.
OMG! you mean the lifeline that allows us to live and be dependent on DC and the DEM party might be reduced?? GOD FORBID!!
Thanks for opposing it!
@SenCoryGardner this doesn't look like something you should allow
Is that the amount your state gets for Medicaid expansion
Colorado voters! Please RT and call Senator Cory Gardner 202 224-5941 and tell him to vote 'NO' on the #GrahamCassidyBill
Im guessing your voting no
The money is not saved it goes to red states disproportionately. This ties in with Koch's threat of cutting off  @GOP. Slow motion murder
no Coloradans save 78 billion with a B in taxes. Quit fear mongering and resign. Life is to short to live a lie get a real job
No it means Coloradans will lose their coverage.
Not true-block grant to states lets each state decide how to serve their own needs. Much more efficient
And because states need to balance budgets, guess what they'll do: cut people off on Medicaid. People will lose coverage.
Why do you think states will cut their voters off, but fed gov won't? States need the flexibility, will make better,local choices
But again, people in these states will be losing their coverage because of the Medicaid cutbacks. It will happen.
Why will it happen?Obamacare has failed-why do you think the fed gov knows more about states population than the state itself? Local control
@SenCoryGardner @RepTipton #GrahamCassidy will hurt Colorado, why are you working against our interests?
Can you make sure @SenCoryGardner knows that? And see if he cares?
