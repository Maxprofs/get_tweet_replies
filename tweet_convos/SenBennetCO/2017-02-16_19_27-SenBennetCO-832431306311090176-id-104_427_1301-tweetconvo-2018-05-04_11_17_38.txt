Thank you from Weld County, 80631! And can you please try to get @SenCoryGardner on the right side of this issue too!
Good move - now keep public schools public and stop your failing education policies - DPS is your neoliberal fail
Why aren't you investigating the Kremlin White House.  Any honest American would be conducting an urgent investigation.
Thank you, Senator Bennett. It’s time to refuse ANY of his nominees!
#NotMyPresident
Your windmills are killing thousands of raptor birds... you ppl are #hypocrits #MAGA by burning more #fossil fuels.
CO2 is plant food...there would be No life on Earth without CO2. All life on earth is carbonBased. More CO2 = food
can you knock some sense in Cory Gardner?
Thank you so much for your support for the environment. You are truly representing Colorado's interests.
tytyty tyty Senator Bennett!!!!
Climate change has been around as long as the earth. Most who speak it do not know what the true driving force is.
Thank you! We need to protect our precious environment and keep CO beautiful!
thank you, keep fighting, Colorado is behind you!
good information, now we just need to get @SenCoryGardner to get on board and oppose Scott Pruitt
Now can you educate @SenCoryGardner ? 
He seems to be just a GOP pawn. He doesn't care about Colorados future.
Thank you!
Thank you!!! I live in Colorado. I appreciate you standing up and doing the right thing--especially being climate  wise
Are you going to vote to confirm any appointments  Or is your  agenda to obstruct the will of the American voter?
Sorry.  But science is far from conclusive on climate change.  Millions of variables make it impossible to model.
Thank you!
