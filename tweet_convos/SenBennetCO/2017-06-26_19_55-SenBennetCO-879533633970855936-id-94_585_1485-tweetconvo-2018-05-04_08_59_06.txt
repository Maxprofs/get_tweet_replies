@SenCoryGardner at least CO has one patriot in office eh!
U CAN'T make money off of SICK people!  People, WAKE UP!  What DO insurance co. DO 4 U? They r middlemen. Take ur $. #DenytheMiddleManAccess
This coming from the idiots that gave us ObamaCare without ever reading it. Take advice from the Mega Stupid Dems...NOT!
Like she said, GOP & Dema need to work together to fix what we've got, not destroy it.
I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no on mtp. 1/3
This should've taken place before Dems shoved ObamaCare up working Americans A**. Now we need to get rid of it.
I block #RussianPropaganda Bye-bye @energymarketman
Bye by bits

@SenCoryGardner 
Mass murder by legislation
Slow death
Like being put on a train
To death camps
To be starved
Abused
& finally gassed
KILLER
The people in power at this time only care about the elephant in the room!!!
@SenCoryGardner  Why have you forsaken the elderly, the disabled, & all who rely on Medicaid to just barely get by?  #CountryOverParty
Come on Mike, you really think I should waste more time on .@SenCoryGardner who the spent weekend kissing Koch butt rather than talk to us?
Thank you for all of your outspoken work on this, @SenBennetCO! I'm calling @SenCoryGardner every day, and will keep doing so.
I'm calling @SenCoryGardner everyday also and am asking family and friends to call too. Gardner needs to know that voters are watching.
202-224-3121 there's the number. Please call daily. I do my best to.
Call Alexander Aramanda
Deputy Legislative Director, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) (202) 224-5922 - Senator Cruz is up for e-election in 2018.

All those guys that met in Colorado last week don't give a shit about anyone but their selves GOP works for them. Good Luck
Talk with the GOP. Your piece of the puzzle might be what's missing. It's worth a try. Begin with C Gardner. He helped create this mess...
Thank you for your #Leadership  #SenBennetCO
#ROBBERYINTHEHOODZ:
#GOPCARE4LESSHEALTHPLAN #HAZARDZONE: Mitch McConnell & the Senate GOP, Could cost 22 million people their insurance coverage over a decade. 
Dems and GOP could have worked together originally but Dems shoves the hideous ACA down our throats.
We'll try our best to get as many people as possible to call and write letters to the editor! Thank you for fighting for us! @IndivisibleRf
Thanks!
Tried to call @SenCoryGardner, no ans, msgs full, he is of no use to Co. citizens, and we will remember in the voting booth.
Try his DC number: (202) 224-5941 I was able to leave a message there this evening. I felt like I was trying even if he ignores me 
I leave him messages all the time. Something is better than nothing!
Thank you, Sen Bennet!   Keep fighting for the non-rich!  This bill is a travesty!!
"Simply put, if there's a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family â€” this bill will do you harm," Obama wrote last week
I lost my health care due to the ACA. Then my provider (co-op Rocky Mtn Health Plans) was bankrupted by ACA ~
Yes! Thank you for continuing to oppose the #HealthcareBill. Proud to call you my Senator.
I spoke to a nice young woman in your CoSprings office, and asked her to tell you to please use all means possible to block this bill
Straight,simple and to the point. Be Heard! Make them listen.Make them afraid to vote yes. Let them know they'll have go out & get real jobs
They can do better, don't want to do better. Don't care about people at all. Only making the rich richer & poor poorer & sicker. Genocide?
Could you at least define so much better... what about the middle class. the small business owners...
While I appreciate your opposition to this #WealthCareBill, please join @SenWarren & push for a single-payer system.
Thank u Senator! Proud constituent 80022.
I liked the Obamacare bill...less bother...didn't even have to read it before it passed.
If you CAN do "so much better"... WHY, THE HELL DIDN'T YOU??? Obamacare is the travesty YOU saddled us with. HYPOCRITE!!!
You showed that you cannot. All you have to do is look at the 17 months & 900 pages of the debacle u call the ACA to know ur not intelligent
I've called, e-mailed, tweeted and ...yes...yelled at the TV! #NoHealthcareBill
Repeal and replace Obumacare
Don't you have anything? Didn't plan on giveaways workkng 4ever did u? Pathetic!
Thank you for sticking up for our health rights as Coloradoans! Please vote no.

1. Tonight, something kinda magical happened on the steps of the Capitol. It started like this: 
BS! It's time for u n Dems 2 quit talking s--t n get 2 work for all ur constituents. The giveaway plan is way over.
I call everyday and yet I see in the Denver Post that Gardner cares more about what the Blue Cross CEO thinks rather than the totals
Thank you @SenBennetCO  Keep fighting for all of us!!! 80526-FoCo
@kimanne123 Thank you

Watched you and yes every word is true!!
Yes we could.  We could repeal the ACA entirely and let people buy what they want.
Go Colorado!
Well instead of bitching about it, dive in and help, puppet!  You are part of the problem then.

Yea! Senator Bennet from my home state of Colorado!! You tell them!
Thank you Senator!
They are damned if they do, damned if they don't. It's pretty amazing that they won't admit that ACA is what free market R's dream of.
We know. We've been dogging potus, sen mcconnell and spkr ryan for months.
Thank you, Senator.
Some #Senators cld b a true #hero fast =work up the courage 2 #VoteNO on #ahca #bcha & ensuing hurt. U have tons of support. #Indivisible
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator. Proud to be your constituent.
Thank you, you make CO proud
I tweeted Senator Bennet, a few months back... trying to encourage him to run for POTUS.
I don't think we can do any better; too many greedy fascists legally bribed to be able to make populist decisions in a collaborative fashion
You Republicans put up a HUGE stink when the ACA passed, but never had a better plan? I mean, my god, you had YEARS to do so..
Technically #ACA is the #Republicans plan and they're pissed
Thank you Senator Bennett for standing up for the people of Colorado (80020)
Thank you for your work, time & dedication to the core principals that have always made America great!
You know Senator Gardner--would it truly make a difference if we Coloradans phoned him?
Why don't you do your damn job and make your voice heard in congress.  We hired you to be a congressional leader not a cheerleader.
Love your passion!!! Thank you for representing Colorado
Yes. How about a public option or single-payer?
"Because government can NEVER be too big, and even though gov't is now over 40% of GDP, I'm here to tell you, we are JUST GETTING STARTED!"
Thank you Senator Bennet!
Please stand with the people and vote against TrumpCare. Also, vote for conviction at his Senate trial.
Agreed, @SenBennetCO!  We, the United States, can do so much better than this #HealthcareBill by @SenateGOP!  It's just downright heartless.
Sen.Bennet, would certainly appreciate a "how" to go along with your assertion. Please, CO deserves better than partisan positioning. Thanks
Thank you @SenBennetCO 
I wish we had 2 of you. 80134. Thank you.
If you can do better, then do better! We're counting on you! Put your work where your mouth is!
