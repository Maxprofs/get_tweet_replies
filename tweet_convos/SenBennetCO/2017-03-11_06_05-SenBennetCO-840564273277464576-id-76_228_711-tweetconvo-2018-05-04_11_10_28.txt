#copolitics 
Previously wrote 11 mil people could lose health insurance. Unfortunately that was optimistic. Turns out it's 24 mil
It can't be worse than NObamacare. You're a partisan that never works with Reps. #sad
Please draft legislation to fix it, however you like, and woo reasonable R's to your cause. It can be done. Work together.
We are getting trampled by GOP & Trump on this healthcare repeal and replace. Rushing to disaster. What to do? Helpless!
Why are willing to work with republicans? That's how obamacare got insufficient in the first place. #publicoption
u are no better than Cory if you continue to be silent. Stop being afraid of T and GOP!!!!!! Represent yourself and us.
Don’t let them escape that name for it. And do everything you can to stop it. Thank you. (Why can’t we have single payer? >.<)
#RepubliCare really IS more appropriate! This article spells it out well: http://diogeneticlight.blogspot.com/2017/03/Dont-Call-It-Trumpcare-RepubliCare.html?m=1 … not #Trumpcare
thanks for supporting Coloradans and all Americans! @SenCoryGardner @RepMikeCoffman please do the same
-Senator Gardner is a one term Senator! He does not represent Colorado!
Thank you. I too wish @SenCoryGardner would stand with people rather than corporations.
@ReinventUrWork @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner I agree with Cheryl!
Thank you, Senator, for doing your job and making us #COproud
YES! Now how about having a forum with @SenCoryGardner and discuss how Colo can stand together for the good of all Coloradans
Thank you Senator Bennet. Your voice and vote is important. I worked for CO Congressman Timothy Wirth D-CO. Would love to help.
@denveropinion #RepubliCare really IS more appropriate! This article spells it out well: http://diogeneticlight.blogspot.com/2017/03/Dont-Call-It-Trumpcare-RepubliCare.html?m=1 … not #Trumpcare
There are thousands who are freelancers, contract workers, under insured who need accessible/affordable healthcare. I'm one.
keep up the good fight!! Protect Colorado families, kids @SenCoryGardner @RepTipton
Tell the Republicans to give up their healthcare and try trumpcare
If you think that then you all need to stop throwing mud & work together for the good of our nation
More than half, 14 million, will lose healthcare in 2018. That is NEXT YEAR! Please protect us!
#trumpcare is a complete disgrace keep up the #RESISTANCE #stoptrump
. What are you doing to fix this? You & your colleagues get free hc. Where is your voice? You are not rep CO. Just as bad as CG.
Thank you senator! Keep up the good work.
Thank you for caring about your constituents and recognizing that this plan will harm more people than it will help.
Are you saying Obamacare was good?  It was passed in secret, drove up costs,  an unnecessarily expensive Medicaid expansion.
I'm reading it now & the main question I have is where will all the money come from and it already shows too many cuts = sucks!
I am not sure GOP wants to work this out.  They just want to destroy.  I have lost faith in our system.
Thank you, Senator Bennet, for representing Colorado in the fight against this insanity.
Thank you for speaking up for us.
Regardless of what happens with #Trumpcare, I suspect many insurers will pull out in 2018 due to uncertainty about the market.
Thank you!
so glad to have you on our side ! We are counting on you - Go get 'em !!
thank you for this and other articles you have published
keep up the fight Sen Bennet. You are our champion!
I am so thankful to have you representing me in the US Senate. Thank you for being the honest politician we need!
Thank you!!!
then offer up suggestions! Otherwise Obamacare fails
You are absolutely correct.  I'm really afraid of what the new plan means for my future. Please help.
worse than triple digit premium increases?  Folks not being able to pick their docs?  Ins cos exiting en masse?
you have to fight them on this and pull Gardner along with you. We need planned parenthood and Medicaid expansion.
Thank you Senator! Where our Senator cares about constituents and state! Now to get @SenCoryGardner to see the light #Colorado
yes we do, too bad @SenCoryGardner doesn't! #GOPNoCare @RepMikeCoffman @RepDLamborn @RepTipton
It makes rich people richer. How could that be so... oh.
Thank you SO MUCH & keep the pressure on... you, too @RepJaredPolis & @SenCoryGardner   From an 'unpaid ' Fort Collins voter!
Thank you!
I will proudly vote against you ! I am a native and you tend to not speak for me
Thank you. Trumpcare would be a disaster. How about single payer?
@SpeakerRyan does not seem to understand (or care about) the foundations of health care. Thx for speaking up.
Thank you!
just read your op-ed piece. Couldn't agree more.  Thanks.
Medicare for all would be cheaper and would cover everyone
Keep up the good work Senator!
Stay strong and stand for what is right @SenBennetCO
My life depends on Obamacare.  Help me. @SenCoryGardner
Thank you, Senator! Please convince @SenCoryGardner and @RepDLamborn to work with you to fix ACA.
Thank you again for using your position to inform and protect Coloradans
Thank you, but, as you may have noticed, Republicans don't play well with others. Now we read they will cheat to pass the bill?
completely agree!
Thank you for this.
We #DontCare what you call it, the people want affordable #HealthCare. Obamacare was fine. TrumpCare looks like it's gonna suck
Thanks for your work, Senator!
thank you.  Single payer.  We're the only nation without it because we worship the profit
Thank you for standing up for what is right.
@SenCoryGardner Thank you Senator Bennet. Senator Gardner? Silent, avoiding comment? #2020vision
thank you
