How is this different than what they are doing to reporters in Colorado? http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/2017/06/05/how-a-clique-of-capitol-reporters-bar-access-to-competitors/ â€¦
Complete Colorado should join CPA, and then we'd go to bat for you. :-)
Do you ever post your own ideas? Just curious
Sorry. If they can't be truthful and give real news they don't belong.
Start w/ Fox.
Start with all of them!!
Thank you for standing up to Trump!  Every day feels like a gut punch to US constitution.
Thank you @SenBennetCO , keep fighting for our rights.
A truly free press does not campaign for one party. They Should be neutral. But we all no the MSM are liberals and don't try to hide it.
Fox campaigned for tRump.
Is attacking providers of inaccurate/ biased news equal to banning free press? You r dealing in fake news
@SenCoryGardner @RepKenBuck Stand with @SenBennetCO !
James Rosen and his folks say "hi."
But, sir, what can you do about it?!!
Attacking the free press & banning reporters is at war with who we are as Americans. This can't stand. #FreePress 
If the free press could show some degree of impartiality in their reporting we might feel sorry for them. Right now they are worse than you.
#FreedomofThePress 
I don't remember your outrage @SenBennetCO re #IRSScandal #fastandfurious #clintonemails....eh?
Now that was #FakeNews.
Unethical, biased reporters should be kept out.
Thank you Senator!!
Thank You for standing with the constitution.  Keep fighting for us, for country & freedom of speech.
I agree. We need free press. If you're representing me you should be straight forward and honest with me. Not hiding Thanks Senator Bennet!
Should have thought about that before attacking President Trump all the time.
Baseless, unfounded, partisan media attacks on our American election is war on democracy. It can't stand. This started long before Nov 8th.
On the other hand, press needs regulation. Shouldn't B able 2 lie/slander whomever they please & call it "news" & going on for years.
Oh be quiet 
You must regulate the 1st amendment;  Third Political Party "The Press" need to be regulated; Fair & Balanced.
#GOPLivesMatter Free speech is the heart of the peaceful resistance. I demand common sense gun regulations. @MomsDemand
Excellently stated!
And what was your part in the GOP assassination attempt? Demoncrats are leading some sort of war to terminate GOP.
@craigscolorado looks like Bennett just stopped dodging interviews with the press
"Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government." - #SCOTUS. (NYT v. U.S. - 1971, re: Pentagon Papers)
Thank you Michael Bennet. I'm a Colorado constituent and I am proud of you! #FreePress
The media is no longer a valuable part of democracy as they traded their integrity for ratings
Thank you Senator Bennet!
Thank you, Senator. We are in the middle of a coup and people are asleep.
The media have become propaganda arm of progressive left, who have taken the Democratic Party hostage and why losing is chronic.
thank you @SenBennetCO for your #ProfileInCourage
 Thank you Senator Bennet
Maybe it's because we're sick of fake news! Think about it Bennet, liberals and democrats have destroyed America with its lies. #maga
Thank you Senator! I hope you will fight this dangerous precedent with actions as well as words! Support a strong free press.
Thank you!!
Thank you Senator, but Dems need to stop the @GOP NOW. Without #freedomofpress we are not a democracy anymore.
@GOP and @POTUS is declaring war on Americans. They want us sick, poor, and unprotected, without a vote or a voice, working until we die.
Thanks for standing up for the constitution, Senator Bennet! You're a true patriot. #FreePress #VoteBlue
Democracy is being replaced by communism by the Gop with President's cronies ties to Russia who would doubt it
Yay, Colorado!  Second best state after Cali! 
It also violates the #OathOfOffice , no?
Should probably just ask what are Republicans are afraid of rather than trying to get people to root for the media.
Seems his message is, don't question liberal news. Become good sheep and follow the herd.
Sen. Bennet, you have to go to the mat. The time is now. Take the floor by whatever means and don't yield it. Pull unanimous consent.
So don't stand, sit. Press should do a sit in. Join forces, stay strong, get arrested if necessary. Don't allow this inappropriate action.
You do Colorado proud. THANK YOU!!
Attacking? Speaking out against fake news is a 1st amendment right. It's part of who we are.
It never happened-#fakenews
Thank You Senator!  Keep fighting!
Colorado ashamed! Go away Bennet, 
This is a disgrace. Who ordered this ?
Thank you Senator Bennet! Democracy dies in the darkness and they are turning the lights out one by one.
Who is going to stop it ?
Thank you senator!
#SenBennetCo  If the press were fair and honest about what they report there would be no issue, but it's more like Mad magazine.
Agreed senator so please fight this w all your might! We Americans are counting on you to uphold our 1st amendment rights! This is still  US
wow, when dems don't get their way the through a hissy-fit, who needs about a year to me out
Constitution? Read
Most are NOT reporters, they're propaganda agents. They are simply trying to hurt Trump and push their liberal agenda. That is not news Mike
That racist America under stupid @realDonaldTrump @Lawrence @latinorebels @LatinosMatter @LatinoVoices @votolatino @NBCLatino @tedlieu
It's time. Withhold consent. Nothing moves without YOUR CONSENT. Do something besides talk before our democracy is GONE!!!
#WithholdConsent
Thank you Senator Bennet for your call to #StandUpFor1A !
