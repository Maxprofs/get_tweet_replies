Very Well Said, Senator.  Please advocate for putting together a Healthcare Reform Coalition representing different areas of hc. Will Help U
We have that now, its all on the DEMS, lets see how they help Americans trying to pay for ins and mortgages, this is a horrible joke! Help?
Not all on the DEMS.  It is on ALL of Congress.  The bill the GOP has been trying to shove through has little support from medical community
thank you!
can we move on now to making all insurance agencies non-profit????? I bet not. I bet you won't dare upset the insurance agencies.
Thank you so much, Sir! Your speech was spot on.
#Democrats actions & ideology used against Americans rights & freedom from #governmemt looks more like former #USSR than #Putin. #elitist
If you think it's so great get rid of your exemption and get all your crooked friends on the plan as well.
Thank you !  Appreciate your dedication and hard work.
You are now responsible for rising premiums and deductibles-you voted for the status quo
@GovofCO should handle healthcare so we don't have to worry about the whims of congress. mitch mcconnel has you on a short leash.
Thank you, Sen. Bennett, for voting WITH the American People. Really appreciate it!
Thank you Senator Bennet for using your voice along with us to stop this bill. You are one trustworthy Senator
That is responsive and allows ea. to retain their pride and to be in charge.  Oh and that the elderly aren't written off.
People didn't raise their voice. The senate decides what their political views want them to vote for. We should have nationwide voting 4 it
Guess we get to see the full effect of Obamacare without the EO's to prop it up.  State budgets will break bc of Medicare expansion. So sad.
Thank you Senator @SenBennetCO !
Thank you Senator Bennet for fighting WITH us. Colorado is proud.
.Thank you Mr Bennet. Too bad @SenCoryGardner doesn't care enough abt CO to put in the time and effort to fix healthcare for us.
Exactly! Tell Gardner he's through!!
He's smug bcs he's got til 2020 but we'll still b here.We won't forget & we won't forget @COsecofstate Williams sending our voter data #2018
Nope we won't. No more complacency. I've got a long list of who isn't gonna be in Washington.
No biggie.  It will implode on it's own..
No, only with GOP and 45 sabotaging it. But believe whatever.
Actually it started imploding under obama and the socialist left admin.  Stay indoctrinated my friend..
You're the one indoctrinated. I see ppl who would be dead or suffering now able to live because of it. Me included. Scoliosis since birth
Now do the right thing by supporting single payer or will you continue to pander to the insurance companies?
Congrats you now have a Bipartisan Obamacare. Now all suffer cause you and @SenJohnMcCain thanks Mike for getting us into this mess.@POTUS
It IS a cause for celebration. NowDems need to take the lead in crafting sane reform for the ACA. #LeadTheWay
except it's not what happened
Thank you Senator Bennet for speaking out for the people of Colorado
Thank you, Senator. Please keep up the good work to solve the challenges of the ACA for better healthcare for everyone.
Thank you at @SenBennetCO for your support of you state and you constituents!
You rock Sen! A real Champion for your Constituents! Thank McCain, Murkowski and Collins from CO.  You...Unlike Gardner represent your ppl!
I disagree that we need "competition" anywhere near healthcare. What we need is care. #MedicareForAll
Then its obvious the govt needs to get out of the Healthcare business. They don't care about us or what obamacare is doing...thank him?Never
Thank you for caring about Colorado.
Our government needs to get out of healthcare.

Thank you Senator Bennet. You listen to Coloradans. @SenCoryGardner could learn a lot from you.
Yet Cory Gardner voted for it. It is time for a skinny repeal of his seat in the Senate.
Unbelievable that grown men can't come together and get a healthcare plan for all Americans!
Meanwhile the CO exchange is in mega deep trouble. Care to address that?
What is that #National Health Care Act?
Thank you Senator Bennet for protecting our healthcare!

I'D RATHER DIE FREE THAN LIVE IN SOCIALISM
