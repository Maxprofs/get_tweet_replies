#BetsyDeVos Shame on you-you know better. If it were up to you inner city people would stay uneducated. Believe me, they won't!
thank you Senators Bennet from Co. Keeping public schools strong. 81050
thank you for opposing the Devos confirmation
let your CO friend @SenCoryGardner know that the "snowflakes" are pissed and winter is coming.
Thanks for your good efforts, Senator.  We must resist the lunacy to the end.
thank you! Colorado appreciates your work. 80525
Thank you for your efforts @SenBennetCO
Hold the floor...does nothing but delay an appointee from assuming Office, & put America's "real issues" from being addressed.
Thank You for your service and efforts!

can you get @SenCoryGardner on board as the third independent Republican who listens to his constiuents?
wow i bet that will be a snooze fest.
too bad your trump supporting, spineless counterpart @SenCoryGardner  doesn't care about kids education.
Try to think independently of your Party and admit you lost this round of appointments, like a man would.
thank you for supporting education in America! @SenCoryGardner I'm extremely disappointed in you and your choices #imnotpaid
thank you!
thank you @SenBennetCO for opposing the nomination of Betsy Devos. School choice cannot work since public education isn't a free market.
Stand strong. I can't imagine how someone so unqualified has gotten this far!
Thank you for your great speech. I appreciate your fight. Please fight against Sessions and Pruitt also.
DeVoss is running TV commercials?  Convince Sen Gardner-Trump to vote against DeVoss.  80304
