If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!
Thank you. Pls support investigation & real action to get these unAmericans out our lives
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren why is not whole America staying up, when this guy undermines your law?
Thanks, Senator, for your courage and ACTION!
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The U.S. Will not be frightened into an autocracy.
Thank you for speaking out against this disgraceful behavior, Senator Bennet.
You're undermining our security, traitor Bennet.
Why aren't you moving to impeach him for undermining our Constitution?
cause that case isn't strong enough and they'd lose. Plus, you know who votes on an impeachment, right?
GOP tried repealing ACA 50+ times knowing it wouldn't go anywhere. Better than sitting around & tweeting about it.
nah. As someone once said: you aim at the king, you best not miss. Build a case first. Give it time
You're right. I'm just frustrated =/
Easy to forget it's only been 3 weeks.
Why did you not call out POTUS on his racial characterization of @SenWarren?
Silencing was wrong in this case, but I have even more admiration for her strength
Secretive @SenBennetCO @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP know @POTUS incompetent. Donor $ drives policy now. Clean air/water? Not so much
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren to much afraid about Mr. Trump? Can't name this guy Mr. President !!
So says the obstructionist, Dem establishment, political hack.Focus on something worthwhile
We are behind you, Sen B and Sen W We continue to write, call, and march!
.@SenBennetCO @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren Sen. Bennet, why didn't YOU stand up to 45's lies about the election/mocking of E. Warren?
no they are to busy fixing the sh!t you and your comrades pulled the last 8 yrs #termlimits
THANK YOU SENATOR BENNET! WE NEED MORE LIKE YOU!
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren Bullies!
we need to know what was in RNC emails, that would explain a lot
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP@dacullington.So true!
#ShePersisted and we will too.  2018: find one person to vote Progressive
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren Too busy counting their money from Betsy DEVOS #soldout
thank you for all you do
the end game is to take rights a little at a time. Start with the scapegoats.
Did you call out his bull when he said it to your face? #voterfraud #warren #dontbesilent
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren They are too busy being corrupt and fleecing the American citizen.
thanks for being the voice of the people and not backing down to these Bullies!
thank you for your strong words. I am asking myself that question every day. Please keep asking @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP
, Mr. Bennet, it's in the hands of the judiciary branch now. If you don't like the law, then pass a different law to change it.
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren Susan Rice an embarrassment 2national security & liar 2the American people
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren Too busy being COWARDS
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren POOR WHINY POTUS!  We will remember that when our sick lose Healthcare!
Thank you!
@AmbassadorRice @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren Because partisanship over country.
Thank you for voting no on Sessions. Stay strong. We're behind you 100%
maybe because his wife is on trumps cabinet? #mitchtoady
bc it's a judiciary overreach against POTUS' right to ban travel? 8 U.S. Code ยง 1182, you should know, your party voted that!
thank you senator.
Thank you Senator Bennet! Well said!
good question.
U have full support to oppose POTUS and GOP on cabinet, ban, wall, legislation, etc
great question. Hypocrisy is the creed of the GOP. Golden Rule doesn't apply to the GOP.
thanks for standing up for your colleague and what is right!
perhaps the 45th didn't take civics -clearly misunderstands the value of checks/balance in a Rebublic. Thank you for leading CO
no they are watching 2015 video of @SenSchumer @SenSchumer calling for refuge ban. Civility?
they think they are strong b/c they hide behind a bigger bully than themselves.
Republicans are too cowardly to stand up to Trump. They will own the mess.
Or even your colleague @SenCoryGardner At least we have you Sen Bennett. Don't let us down.
we are with you Sen Bennet.  80817
@rockiesmagicnum @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren And looking for their testicles.
Thank you Senator. Colorado is proud. We need your continued voice. A Good Senator for sure
GOP afraid of Trump don't you see he will destroy them if they don't do his bidding.
They are searching for the highest bidder on the next cabinet position.
@SenCoryGardner Good question. Senator Gardner?
thank you senator Bennett! Keep fighting and vote NO on #pollutingPruitt
There is so much wrong with this @POTUS.  #fakenews #nodivestment,using office to enrich DT
@SyberJennifer @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenWarren That's too narrow. This is a Regime and #45 is NOT ACTING ALONE. All repub..
Thank you for standing up for the people! #resist
Yes Mike, give them hell for silencing her! Thanks for having Liz's back!!! #resist
Senator Bennet, the people of CO are proud of you! Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump How is he  undermining the Judiciary?  The dems need to stop the nonsense.
GOP is a bunch of PUSSY's that Trump grabbed!
Thank you, Senator Bennet. Where is .@SenCoryGardner? Counting his DeVos campaign funds?
Continue to fight! Do everything you can! 80504 #notapaidprotestor
Thank you Senator Bennet for all you're doing.
Open dialog and honor are not in the GOP tool kit, Witness Merrick Garland.
@ How exactly is he undermining the Judiciary? 3 weeks in office and this is your stance? Why won't you Dems join America?
the duty all Americans is to defend the Constitution-the better question is why isn't the 45th? Checks&Balances
Were you asleep during the Obama Admin?
thank you Senator Bennett for accurately representing our national and CO interests
it's shameful!
Thanks Senator Bennet! Keep GOP to account!
@Shotgun_Mary @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP And colluding in nepotism; McConnell's wife works for Trump
Since when is filing a lawsuit to correct a constitutional wrong considered undermining?
Consistency is important.Thanks for speaking up when others choose not to "for the eggs"
thank you Senator, your voice is very important, keep at it!
Votes are more important than people. They choose to be sheep, not pack leaders.
thank you. Your comments give me hope for this nation when hope is really hard to come by
Thank you Senator! This is why I voted for you, it feels nice to have my voice heard
well said. Prejudice against women front and center. The message is received loud/clear.
Please fight, Mr Bennet and Mrs Warren - don't let these idiots ruin our country.
Thank you so much for calling out their extreme hypocrisy!
Thank you!  What he is doing is just terrible and will sow doubt about our fine judiciary.
