Then step aside and let someone who will do something in there...lead, Follow or get the hell out of the way...your chatter is a road block.
Environmental protection and Russia investigation
Trump has done more in100 days than the last administration did the 8 years.
I would qualify that to he has done more damage in his 1st 100 days than almost any prior president.
Come on he's had a hard time with his own party and liberals. You would hope at some point there can be some bipartisan compromises. To MAGA
I do honestly hope so. With the split in the GOP, that is the only way things might get done.
At least for now both parties are trying to get some things done. About time. There's still a lot of hurrdles to get over. It getting there
Trump/Russia corruption
Dems need to get active about fixing the healthcare problems.  ACA won't survive in current state. Get busy to save it! 80863
Real healthcare reform fixing the ACA flaws, not repealing it. #SaveACA
save the environment. Stop oil and gas from destroying our water and our air. #systemchangenotclimatechange
American voters completely disagree with your political hack synopsis. Did you see the crowd in blue PA last night? #clueless
I agree with all of the suggestions here, but protecting the environment must be first priority
Lowering wages and slashing benefits for those in Congress. A budget would be nice too.
Impeaching the current president.
Push for Independent investigation of Trump/Russia; demand Trump's races!  fix ACA; get EPA back.  Thank you, Sen. Bennet!
Impeaching Trump.
I voted for you and you disappoint
Fixing healthcare; environment.
Fix Obamacare -don't get rid of it. Update NAFTA- No wall- use that $ for education -Retrain unemployed. Stop ICE extremism-allow bail.
What ever happened to investigating Hillary's private server, and Benghazi?
I fear that Trump is secretly trying to undermine safety net. Constant attacks on 90% for top 10%  benefit
Impeaching Trumps Klan!
#impeachtrump
IMPEACHMENT.
Why not govern and quit the snarky BS
140 million Americans the government wants to keep on welfare. And find more to join.
Getting to the bottom of the Russian interference in our election, and the collusion w 45 team.  Everything else is secondary.
Look in the mirror when you want to see who is wasting time.
The important issues are easy to find.

We have an infrastructure that is crumbling Washington needs to stop attacking things and take positive steps @Fillmore_Denver
Leave the ACA alone, fund the government, stop rattiling sabers and work to fix the infrastructure no politics @Fillmore_Denver
Democratic/Socialist talking points garbage...no truth at all. What we can't afford is to waste another Senate term on @SenBennetCO!

Quit creating false story lines and talking points to stall POTUS's agenda.
Term Limits, IT Security, Immigration.  Healthcare and Tax Reform.  A little Unified Team Building with Congress as a whole would not hurt!!
Climate change
Single payer healthcare.
Offer solutions instead of demogogging. fix the problems created by obamacare, back POTUS on foreign policy and tax reform
y'all have wasted the last 8 years what's the rush now?
U know we R in the mess when we have a list that long that still misses some issues on the cluster we're in that we have to pick a focus
AND GOP gerrymandering, fix ACA, protect net neutrality, help the EPA, campaign finance,term limits! It's all broken. And again, RUSSIA.
TRUMP'S TIES TO RUSSIA. Get him out before he starts a war with NK. You know that he wants that so he can prove he's a big man. Do something
Trump-Russia Collusion! We need an INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION to get to the bottom of it. #IllegitimateElection #trumpRussiaEspionage
#Trumprussia and Climate

Russia.  Conflicts of interest.  Russia.  Emolument.  Russia.
While tax reform is being discussed, how about a revenue-neutral carbon tax?
Russian collusion and anti espionage investigation. Stop trump from consolidating more power. Save environment. Impeach trump!
Independent investigation into #TrumpRussia. The GOP should be ashamed for being so blas√© about our election being hacked.
Resistance, and independent investigation into Russia's activities during the election.  Sincerely, 80927
Improve and expand ACA, stop voter supression, criminal justice reform, Russiagate, stop those using the White House for personal enrichment
Health reform is a tough battle when 53% of kids have at least one chronic health issue. We consume a lot healthcare. Ask better questions
Impeach Trump should be #1

Fully investigating 45 and any/all who may have had a part in his illegal dealings. Congress needs to focus on country before party.
Single-payer universal healthcare. It's time we join the rest of the civilized world and guarantee healthcare as a right for all citizens.
Cleaning house of every single GOP idiot dragging on their bellies in their own filth.
Focus on Universal Health Care, RussiaGate, thoughtful progressive tax reform, outlaw gerrymandering via sensible redistricting, campaign $$
Both parties should support a system of checks and balances as it was intended including nonpartisan oversight. Restore public confidence
climate, sane healthcare policy, sane financial regulations, less uninformed trump making terrible decisions
#Russiagate - investigate fully
Thank you Senator Bennet
Dear @Potus you need to work FOR EVERONE not just the rich people.  I expect to see results.
Quit wasting our time with ridiculous lists like this. #Get2Work #COPolitics
Improving ACA or enacting single payer or public option. Making college free or at least affordable. Protecting environment. Infrastructure.
No legislation until an independent investigation into the #TrumpRussia connection.
#TrumpRussia How many are involved? The senate needs to pressure Burr to do his job!! INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION!!
Doing nothing ... 

Reverse all the bs executive self dealing orders

Make charges for EMOLUMENTS Nepotism TREASON Perjury
Working on term limits would be nice.
impeachment. plus protecting net neutrality + environmental regulations.
And protecting healthcare.
RUSSIA!  What did the president know, and when did he know it?  What kompromat does Putin have on him?  What about business conflicts?
Probably Russian loans as well.. Putin hacked him too I am sure!
Funding EPA
#BuildTheWall #RefugeesNotWelcome #BanWallRaids #AmericaFirst
And most definitely more tweets directly from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 
Fixing and expanding ACA
Independent investigation, Russian collusion
Protecting Net Neutrality and our Climate. Oh and impeachment.
Yes
Lowering taxes, getting rid of unnecessary regulations, securing our border
