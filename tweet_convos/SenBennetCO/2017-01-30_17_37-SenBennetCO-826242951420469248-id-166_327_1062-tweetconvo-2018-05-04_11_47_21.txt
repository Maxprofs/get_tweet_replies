I am perfectly fine with it, just add at least Saudi Arabia. You sir, are a liberal hack, that cares little about the Americans
John Deeton, you should not call people names.  I am proud to be liberal, but when you use it - it is an ugly slur
You mean like racist? How does it feel to be irrelevant? Sit down, shut up, pay attention and learn how a ctry should be governed
I will continue to speak up about the wrongs that I am witness to in my country.  And your gun is one of them.
Yet when TSHF you'll come running to people like me to save you. Bet you wouldn't be so against it, if it saved your life.
domestic gun owners do NOT save lives.  There have been 280,024 domestic gun deaths in past 10 years. Only 24 terrorist deaths.
Berkeley, yeah, you liberals are brilliant. Destroy your own stuff and beat people in the name of tolerance. Bunch of losers.
Agreed. Democrats need to say no to all the appointees.
Thank you my Senator.  Thank you.  Well put.  I am so frightened, but I must stand up to this.
.@SenBennetCO .@Medium Wonderful, moving speech on the floor. Thank you for standing up for ALL humans, and for our American values! #Peace
That was Obama's.  You're not an idiot, start protecting the US. How is it Illegal is legal?
@SenateDems @Medium This constituent is with you! Let the people of Colorado know how we can help.
What is wrong with proper vetting?
@SenateDems @Medium assimilate
Please vote no on Tillerman, DeVos, J. Sessions, and Mnuchin! And start IMPEACHment TRUMP and PENCE!
Trump has no known impeachable offences.
what about unknown
@SenateDems @Medium where was all your outrage when Isis was committing genocide on your watch? Dems helped create refugees.
Danger, enemy, real threat, evil so diverse. Take my challenge Senator or President? It is a real opportunity! RN Tess
@SenateDems @Medium I say it does that's why he won the presidency. We come first and r vets homeless not Muslim they don't ass
@SenateDems @Medium obama's did the same thing?
POTUS you and your cohorts have been trying to destroy "American values" for the last 50 years.
Yes! Thank you for saying so.
absolutely!! Keep up the good work!!
So true
What value is that? Being a doormat for people?
Sen.Bennett please vote against Pruitt
was rollout as bad as #aca web implantation?
Wrong!  sanctuary cities do not make us safe - stop spending tax $$ on ten & enforce the law.
then why don't your cosponsor Diane Feinstein's bill to rescind it?
no surprise. And what have you done?
Doubt if you read it. Know you didn't understand it. Keep supporting terrorist rights.
Senator, please hold up all the nominations until Bannon is out.
Wrong - send nominations thru so they can help get rid of Bannon!
@SenateDems @Medium why didn't @TheDemocrats @BarackObama stop Isis from committing genocide, & creating refugees?
I challenge all to do DNA genotype ancestral origin. Everyone will have someone they hate if hater or others we love 
your answer to why @TheDemocrats @BarackObama didn't stop Isis is: we should all submit to DNA testing? #foh
we need action from you
stripping civil rights,alienating allies,compromising safety/security=grounds for impeachment
fight for us senator Bennett!
because you all did NOTHING to think ANYTHING through and this POTUS is trying to make you THINK.  Too HARD?  Try it.
This is the exact same order that President Obama submitted.  Why was it ok then and not now?
Proud granddaughter of immigrants! EO is shameful, cowardly!
As a Colorado citizen, I disagree.
#NoSessions  @Medium
thank you for standing up for what is right
So how many things did you execute right on your first week in a job?!  Go read and learn the Constitution!
- politics? You have a brain, use it.
- You are wrong again! Conveniently taking the party position. When are you going to put the people of Colorado above
@SenateDems @Medium We finally have a President that cares about American's!Our SAFETY is his priority!Thank you Pres. Trump!
Why didn't say that about @BarackObama order to ban Iraqies 4 six mths or Cubans seeking asylum! @FoxNews
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/826242951420469248 … (Ranked 2nd for Jan 30.)
@SenateDems @Medium Take his executive orders and stick them up his nonexecutive ass. now it's not a ban. LIARS!
@SenateDems @Medium isint that the truth. Hope the nuts who voted for this nut are happy. They will ruin our country in 4 years
please do not confirm Betsy DeVos!
You are correct.  Please keep fighting against these un-American executive orders.
I'm serching for your disapproval of Pres Obama's temporary ban on Iraqi immigration. Still looking. This smells of politics.
Really??? It's okay for Obama. I want every Senator opposed to take in 20 refugees & 40 homeless people
Thank you for speaking out and staying strong @SenBennetCO @SenateDems
@SenateDems @Medium Trump was elected because Washington doesn't work. Please get to work approving Trumps cabinet picks.
and this is NOT a shameful departure. These people DO NOT ASSIMILATE! they are DANGEROUS to the USA!
and OH YES it will make us safer. We DESERVE to have a President at last WHO CARES FOR US! FIRST!
no it did not. There will always be a transition period as you should well know from your ACA garbage
STAND up in Congress! The band is unconstitutional. Immigration to the US cannot be determined by country of origin
I agree so....do not confirm ANY of Trumps picks and as for the Supreme Court.....NEVER!!!
smoke screen lies typical Democrats
@SenateDems @Medium Sen Bennet standing tall for the great state of Colorado. Very proud to say my Senator is a fighter
Thank you Michael Bennett.
thank you for standing up for USA as shelter for those who are fleeing persecution, whatever their religion or race.
Thank you
@SenateDems @Medium indeed it does make us safer!  Ask family members from San B & Orlando.
@SenateDems @Medium Vote NO to sessions

you say this because even if there is a terrorist attack it won't effect you, but the people on the front
Thank you, Senator Bennet! We Coloradoans support you!
Thank you Sen. Bennet! Your thoughtful votes for justice & fairness are very much appreciated.
Thank you !
please don't forget anything he has done in the last 10 days. We are watching him. And the senators and congressman
The entire majority needs to stand up and take Donald Trump to court together.
@SenateDems I hope you are listening to America. Do not confirm Sessions. It’s your civic duty to obstruct Trump now.
@SenateDems @Medium it's beyond a policy issue. this president must be stopped. #25thAmendment
@SenateDems @Medium Where is the Democratic Party? Why are you not holding news conferences disavowing trumps craziness
Thank you Sen. Bennett
And prevent Sessions' confirmation. He will back Trump's anti-immigration stance.
@SenateDems VOTE NO on SESSIONS
Please vote no on Sessions 
Thank you! Now #StopPresidentBannon #StopDeVos #StopDeVos
That's a bunch of crap! We have had too many attacks to be worried about a little inconvenience at the airports. Go Trump!
Thank you Senator Bennet!
There's nothing American or human about Trump's EO. As a CO resident, I beg you to stand up to him & keep fighting
Agreed. Please delay and reject all nominations!
, a BIG ask from a constituent: #ShutItDown until the #MuslimBan is repealed. Better a dysfunctional govt than an unAmerican one
I actually don't have any ideas, but it sounds like you do? Pass them along to your reps!
yeah! Why did Obama strand so many Cubans without warning?
#notmysenator
.@SenBennetCO agree!  Please withhold consent until this travesty is recinded!
thank you for speaking up, Senator. From a Colorado constituent.
Thank you @SenBennetCO . @SenCoryGardner?
EVERYONE in the DEM party needs to say NO to everything this man wants. Every damn thing!!
@SenateDems @Medium   Even if that were true, it would be better than your perpetual inaction. @POTUS
thank you! Good job not supporting Sessions!
I seem to remember a place called a reservation where the true American people are still held  in an oppressive situation.
@SenateDems @Medium Thank you Senator. We support you 100%
It enforces the law as prescribed by President Obama.  Terrorist nations
It keeps us safer by keeping illegals out that might harm us. What planet do you live on?
 your grandparents' note! How blessed you are to have such a history, and how blessed are we to have a senator who has compassion.
If it saves just 1 life
@SenateDems Keep whining! WE VOTE!!
Thank you from a constituent. And please take action to stop Bannon - he does not belong on the NSC.
thanks for representing us well!
@SenateDems @Medium be careful what you wish for Sir. You make plans and God laughs
The values of the ME include not taking in your own people.
@SenateDems @Medium I take it the vetting by TSA at airports on Americans is against our values. Let's protest TSA. Ur morons!!
@SenateDems @Medium shame on you for shoveling your distorted agenda.
@SenateDems @Medium get a grip 47 of you dems voted on it
@indivisibleden @Medium thank you Senator Bennet!
Not taking in Syrian refugees and closing our borders isn't mean or heartless. I lock the doors to my house every night. I don't lock them..
because I hate the people outside my house. I lock them because I love the people inside my house. Seeing what is happening with the........
refugees in Europe is enough to warrant President Trump's temporary immigration ban order. To protect the American people, which I support..
thank you
@SenateDems @Medium the poorly assumed electorate by the dems showed there r Americans who care more about jobs than rainbows
@SenateDems @Medium you have no clue about American values. Just a used car salesman gimmick
@SenateDems @Medium let's hear your idea? Easy to criticize. I haven't heard a competing idea.
THANK YOU. Now how are you going to vote on the Betsy DeVos confirmation? NO, I hope!
@SenateDems @Medium does @TheDemocrats @BarackObama allowing Isis to run rampant, & take sex slaves make the world safer? #foh
agreed! Keep up the #RESISTANCE
you are sick person, let @realDonaldTrump do the job ,stop creating violence,jerks
I'm glad you're speaking out. I spared you on my letter wrath, so I just want to say thank you for actually representing CO.
Please consider bi-partisan amendment to abolish or at least limit Pres Exec Orders.
@SenateDems @Medium Dems need to stiffen their spines. They have to mount major filibusters on EVERY bill, on EVERY SCOTUS nom
Backbone...I appreciate you tweet
@SenateDems @Medium #fakenews
You've got that right. Everybody knows but Trump, the Predator-in-Chief.
Please do more than tweet though! Fight this on the hill! Impeach!
Keep fighting Senator Bennet!
I'm sure it is the first of many that will erode the foundations of our republic. Please fight everyday for all of us.
Introduce Legislation
While I disagree on some of the substance, your argument is sound, rational, and reasoned. Thank you, Senator.
Let's give a big shout-out to @SallyQYates for refusing to have @TheJusticeDept defend the #MuslimBan. One smart attorney.
the AG should ban the TSA from vetting Americans at our airports. Violating our rights.
Thank you Senator Bennet
very happy I voted for you.
Thank you for speaking out against this senator Bennet.
