Breaking News: President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff http://nyti.ms/2wwiwbP 
Thank you, Senator. Now do something.
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/901270387568267264 … (Ranked 1st for Aug 25.)
The Constitution offers only one remedy for a president who abuses the pardon power to defy enforcement of the rule of law;impeachment.
More Divide & Distract from The Left #FakeRepresentative #ClimateChangeHustler @SenBennetCO Following immigration laws is racist & criminal?
The fake president pardoned a man who violated the law.
#LineralLoon The #KenyanTerrorist #FakePresident @BarackObama is the only one who broke Fed. Immigration laws by refusing to in force them.
You obviously don't know the meaning of terrorist.  But I agree that DT is a fake president who has no clue how to lead a country!
And Ma'am you & @BarackObama may very well fit the definition of a Terrorist.
Hey, I've got a troll!  Now I feel like I've made it in Twitter-land.
@SenCoryGardner @RepMikeCoffman how you feel about @realDonaldTrump pardoning Arpaio? You seem to be speechless. Now is the time to speak.
Time to impeach Sen Bennett. I'm a constituent.
Of what? Racism, bigotry and hate?
Arpaio was not a traitor to his country like Chelsea manning who got pardoned by obozo! Arpaio wanted to stop illegals in Arizona!
Hey Mike-you remember Obama's pardon of terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera? #Terrorist! But you were silent then! Why is that? #NoPrinciplesBennet
I'm appalled w the prez. He is singlehandedly harming his office and our democracy. He must be stopped by impeachment!
Aiding, abetting, harboring, encouraging illegals a felony & you folks are guilty!!! @SenBennetCO @hickforco @DNC  http://americanpatrol.com/REFERENCE/AidA …
I guess there was a shortage of martians sneaking into the US from Mexico, heh spinner!?
he did what you are afraid to do! Protect our borders! You have made America less safe!
And what will you do about the pardon? It cannot go unchallenged!
I often wonder what planet you people are from, including Bennett.
You have the power to do something.  Please stand up and stop the madness tweets are meaningless.
Bennet is a disgrace to Colorado!
Sir: He was my sheriff for 21 yrs.. i would not trade 1 Arpaio for 100 McCains, Flakes etc. or any leftest, libdem!

Sheriff Joe was sheriff of my county (Maricopa) for 21 years. He did nothing but enforce the law. Not driven by politics. Excellent servant!
But yet all of Obamas pardons were ok?
Worth repeating! "Accepting of pardon is an admission of guilt and can be used in civil suits."
Every. Single. Word!  The daily destruction of our democratic norms and morals is abhorrent. Resist w/ all you've got Senator! We need you!
The more resistance the more divided the country will be! We need to come together to #maga!
@NancyPelosi Joe Apaio saved countless lives putting CRIMINAL illegals behind bars. When are you doing to start defending US citizens?@POTUS

Nice to see you care more about CRIMINALS than law abiding citizens.  Obama pardoned 1700 felons many were arrested again including Murder.
How do you feel about obamas pardon of oscar Lopez?
Tytyty Senator!!
Will Lenard Peltier be next?
10% of colorado are Italians says OSI

This is the crime that Trump just pardoned:willful defiance of a federal judge’s lawful order to enforce the Constitution.
Dear @SenBennetCO : AsJames Madison noted at the Virginia ratifying convention,abuse of pardon power is grounds for impeachment. Act now.
Thank you for representing us and speaking out against DT's racist agenda!
#Trump is #RacistPresident
Meanwhile the Fake POTUS is systematically dismantling government protections that benefits the average citizen. 
@nytimes Chelsea manning
another shameful action by thecurrentwhitehouseresident! I am not surprised, but appalled 
Thanks @realDonaldTrump for pardoning a sheriff who enforced immigration laws that Dems like this one completely ignored. #MAGA
And? Your words come much too late. It's a done deal now.
Thank you @SenBennetCO for #stAndingforAmerica
Shameful. More evidence of trump's racism and disregard for rule of law. He is dismantling our govt. Please, stop him.
Can you please work on Healthcare and tax reform?
You're a great rep for Colorado. Now be a great rep for America and help get this idiot out of office.
Thank you. Please save us all from this terrible fake president. The longer he is in the White House the worse the damage he inflicts
Thank you Senator. It's time. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Thank you Senator for standing-up for US!
Proud to have you represent CO!
What are Congress going to DO to keep this egomaniac in check?! Anything?!
Well said.Why do this?With all that has turned the country upside down the last 2 wks??A gift to 25% of voters to further alienate the rest?
When are you going to start speaking the truth as a leader instead of anticipating the polls in your base?  You just want open borders.
Not targeting latinos on the AZ border.  Who would you target?  Asians & Whites?  You sound like the ACLU in South Chicago!!
If population of a  neighborhood is 95% African Am, you don't require the same % of pullovers as in other hoods with different populations.
After Obama effectively pardons Manning you have the gall to say this about a man enforcing the law.  Hard not to target latinos in AZ.
Thank you for standing up to power.  The US is priority over party.
Have you followed his case?  You might want to wait before you say too much.  The pardon was for a misdemeanor.  Get over it.
Help move to censure and then impeach this would be king.
there has to be some type of abuse of power here?
I appreciate @SenBennetCO finally standing up to Trump. Kind of late but please keep it up.
What are you going to do? Or do brown people not matter?
Will you call on Trump to resign? #TrumpResign
Shameful & disgusting! But the norm for a racist bully who is an off the rails president? Time to RISE up. America is better than this
Trump has only contempt for the law when it stands in the way of something he wants. Spoiled brat.
You try to make yourself out to be a centrist, but with this statement you are showing your true colors as a lefty loon.
How will Congress respond? #25thAmendmentTime ?
So far, the answer is: weakly and pathetically
You get upset about Arpaio? Where is your outrage about Clinton and National security? You sir, are a fool!
Very well said, sen Bennett.
@SenBennetCO is okay to tag @POTUS in these tweets. He needs to see these.
Hope @realDonaldTrump ends #DACA tonight too. Tired of lawlessness.
Everyday
We have bigger shit to deal with in this country then who gets a pardon this is why we voted him in and you prove you American people right.
@SenCoryGardner is silent. I guess he's a racist too.
Gardner rarely races to the microphone when #Trump is involved. If you're not outraged, then maybe you're a #coward?
Of course he's a coward.
Thank you @SenBennetCO
This is a disgrace.
Thank you, Senator! #Leadership
Bennett doesn't know what leadership is. I am going to run against him if he wins another term.

Laughing at??????
Agree! What can be done?
Republicans could grow a spine.
Why is @SenCoryGardner such a pendejo?
What is congress planning to do about Trump's abuse of power?
Nothing because he's not. Why would you state something so false?
So thankful to have you representing my state, Senator. Thank you!
