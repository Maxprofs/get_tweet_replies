thank you for your excellent work and continue your efforts by voting no for Pruitt
Thank you Senator Bennett. Please also protest Steve Bannon's appt to the NSC. He is an extremist and warmonger.
- Please tell us Michael, whatvare your values. We don't know. All you do is criticize.
Thank you Senator Bennet you speak for the majority of real Americans who oppose the #muslimban
Thank you for standing firm.  Keep talking with all of Congress to resist the tyranny.
I believe Bennet means "Liberal-Progressive Democrat Politically Correct Values" which overrides the safety of Americans
Then let them all come to Colorado, welcome them with open arms.  Dont ask for help when they rape and kill your loved ones...
Thank you for standing up for what is right!  Thank You for No Vote on DeVos!
Sen Bennet U Must Keep the Ban in place President Trump needs 2 add 10 more countries to ban & 9 months to process !

Thank you for sticking up for our values.
: thanks- for your hard work, please stand up if @realDonaldTrump doesn't follow fed ruling today! #notapaidprotester
it is not a ban on Muslims. Bennet needs a new pool of voters to draw from as the Dem's do
Ask other Dem Senators to  be bold be as obstructive as poss, filibuster, any legal means. You have the power to stop it
Rescind the EO on immigration.  Bad for America.
thank you & block Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the SC in support of women's rights & the separation of church and state
is the congress going to do something about it?
agreed! Emphatically!!
No.
Please oppose and filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch's confirmation.
proud to have you representing our state Senator Bennett! #staystrong #NoBanNoWall
Why does the travel ban not include countries trump has business deals.  Trump stands for CORRUPT.
YES I AGREE
SHUT UP!
why?
hey Mike start wearing these. Get ready for a new job to. @BobLeahyJr It only took Trump 5 days to erase 8 years of STUPID!
And my son voted for Trump.
Obviously you Senator are not concerned about the Citizens safety and my son & only grandchildren live in your state.
it is not a ban. What don't you understand ? We need to improve vetting.
We need extreme vetting of POTUS: #25thamendment
This is exactly what voters are tired of. Pure politics-party before Country. Sad!
@POTU

Thank you Senator!  We stand with you.
Thank You so much your constituents are proud to see you boycotting and using every way possible to stop all this.
