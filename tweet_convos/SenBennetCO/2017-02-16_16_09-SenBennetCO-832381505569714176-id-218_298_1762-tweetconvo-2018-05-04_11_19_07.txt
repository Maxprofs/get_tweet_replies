Thank you!
Thank you!
of course you will. Your politics won't let you a) look at the science and b) think for yourself. SO SAD...
Get all democrats to vote no! Literally everyone is as risk.  W. Virginia and North Dakota get on the right side of this
Thank you for your no on Pruitt! Convince Cory Gardner that to show he cares he needs to do the same for Colorado
it's a shame you don't have the guts to go against the radical party line, the EPA is out of control, reign them in!!
Thank you
thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Bennet
Thank you.  I support standing up for the truth and what is right!

Good fight.  Thanks!  Stop, breathe, think is the way to go.  And then do what's right.

Thank you!
Atta boy Mr Bennet. Keep up the good fight.
Thank You Sen. Bennet! If only @SenCoryGardner would fight for his kids future, sad!
Bless you Sir!  Thank YOU!

Thank you, Senator. Get some bugs in some ears. This farce cannot come to pass.
You are a true man of Colorado. Thank you so much for your service to me as a citizen.
please support EPA Region 8 Denver. They need to know they aren't being abandoned & isolated.

Thank you!
The snow capped mountains thank you, the clear clean rivers thank you, the cool clean air thanks you, and I thank you.
Thank you Sen Bennet.
Please stop drinking the Kool-aid, and step out of the echo chamber.
You've made the wrong decision.
Thank you! Perhaps you could convince your colleague across the aisle from Colorado to do the same? @SenCoryGardner
thank you!!
As your constituent and a caring human, thank you! Any chance you can have a heart to heart with @SenCoryGardner?
Thanks!  @SenBennetCO @EPA He wasn't a good defender of his own state, imagine how much less he will care about Colorado.
good work! You do represent Colorado, but your constituents also want you to vote and make decisions based on good info
Thank you Senator Bennet!!!!

Thank you. Do not allow the vote to go forward until his records ordered by the Oklahoma judge are reviewed
Your constituents thank you!
Thank You, Sir!!! That's awesome news! Thank you for standing for our CO values & fighting for what's right. 
Thank you!!! You truly represent Coloradans & our values. Too bad @SenCoryGardner has sold his soul.
oh Michael you know the only reason you WILL vote no is because he is a @POTUS nominee honey let's BE honest #howsistheACA
thank you!
Great decision. The only ethical decision.
Thank you
I never see this many "thank you'd" on any @SenCoryGardner social media sites. That in itself should speak volumes to him

Thank you! So glad you, as my Senator, can deliberate & weigh factors in choosing qualified candidates for key posts.
Sen Bennet, I don't think you should tweet unless you vote FOR a nominee.  Huge news for you not to follow Dem party line

@SenCoryGardner I wish your CO counterpart would do the same. Thank you for standing up for our great state and our enviro
