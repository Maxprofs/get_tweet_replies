ALERT: Reporters at Capitol have been told they are not allow to film interviews with senators in hallways, contrary to years of precedent
Yes! @SenBennetCO you represent your state so well! Thank you. #FreedomOfThePress
Thank you for protecting the people's right to information!
What was your part in attempted assassination of GOP whip?
Thank you Senator Bennett from a Colorado voter
 thank you, Senator! So proud to have you representing Colorado!
Fake news house to go
I’m moderate (57% Rep & 43% Dem). Dems are indirectly resp. for Rep. Scalise being shot.  1st it was Kathy Griffin.  Then, Caesar play in NY
Its only in recent years they've been allowed to. It's not like they've always been.
As usual, @SenBennetCO is making Colorado proud. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of @SenCoryGardner
End the Trump hunt, or keep pushing moderates away.  Your party will lose big in 2018 because it is clueless and panders to freaks & maniacs
Sad
You Rock
how about you @SenCoryGardner?
BTW, is Sen. Gardener ever going to communicate with his constituents about the SUPERSECRET horrid "Trumpcare" bill? Some will die b/c of it
yeah, good. but what would really impress me is if you withhold consent until gop makes public, and holds hearings on, secret health bill.
Thanks! @SenCoryGardner will you be doing the same or hiding from the press like you hide from your constituents?
You rock @SenBennetCO !! Proud to have you as my senator The free press is essential to our democracy 
The political stunt offer that no one accepted.
ALERT: Senate may require press to follow written rules.  But no, this is Fake News too!!
Thank you! And you @SenCoryGardner ? Likely not. Cory loves party first. #1p1v
Suppressed press.sad
Thank you Senator! Proud to be your constituent. #Colorado
Also very proud to be your constituent!
Does Senator Michael Bennet(D) treat the Media better than he treats homeless people in Colorado?

#copolitics
This is an insane claim. Do you also believe homeless people run on tires?
@lisamarie22222 Thank you, Sen. Bennet for being a voice of reason and truth, in a miasmic swamp!
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/874670563062624256 … (Ranked 1st for Jun 13.)
Well done.
Freak.
Yes! You go, Senator Bennet
That's MY senator. So kind!
Thank you for your working knowledge what representation means! Bennett for the people!!!
Thank you Senator, I am proud to be your constituent
I am a moderate, but may never vote for another Dem.  Change the party name to the Vitriolic Party cuz all you do is whine, lie, & hate.
Sen. Bennet, you are a rockstar, sir.
Thank you, Senator.  I am proud to have you represent me. - 80927
You're worried about a bunch of #newsclowns to protect their 1st amend. and allow the circus in your office.  No wonder 0 gets done in D.C.
Thank you, Senator Bennett for protecting our free press.
Thank you for walking the walk in Washington. Looking forward to voting for you again!
That's the way Senator
You're awesome! Thank you, @SenBennetCO, for upholding free speech!
#republicanassholes #WhatisGOPhiding
@SenBennetCO Do everything in you power to urge every fellow Dem Sen to "Merrick Garland" all Sen business until you & public see bill.
Thank you for standing up for the First Amendment.
Thanks Senator Bennet!
Thank you! At last, sanity.
I like this Mr Bennet.  Thank you for caring about American democracy!
Thank you Senator for trying to maintain some semblance of sanity there. And thank you for voting #NoAHCA
Thank you @SenBennetCO , I'm so proud you're my Senator.  Keep fighting, we're behind you.  @CoryGardner  where are you?
Because the press never asks Democrats hard questions. I loathe Trump, but the press has been an arm of the DNC for 8 years.
Make the ad now to use this tweet for your reelection!!
good for you
Thank you Senator for supporting a free press. And thanks @kasie for sharing this.
Thank you!

Thank you, Senator. Please fight against the AHCA, too!
Sweet!  The people of this great beautiful country thank you!!!
Love this. Glad there are still a few flames burning.
Thank you @SenBennetCO for protecting the #FreedomofPress
Simply outrageous! This administration is dangerous to democracy.
Film anyway.
Great idea Senator Bennet!
Glad to see at least one of our Senators defends our Constitution, unlike @SenCoryGardner, who is busy running and hiding from us.
Thank you so much, Senator. I'm outraged by this new GOP restriction on press freedom.
Thanks, Mr. Bennet. That's most welcome!
Thank you! We need the press more than ever!
Great idea. Please, @CoryBooker and @SenatorMenendez, considering doing the same thing.
I LOVE OUR COUNTRY!
What happened to not "abridging the the freedom of speech, or of the press"? Is right to petition the govt for grievances still intact?
GOP IS DECLARING WAR AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!
Violation of the constitution!!!   Lock them up!!!
More @GOP #whitesupremists. These needs to end before they destroy the USA.  Where are our warriors from past history.
Thanks, @SenBennettCO! Jeez, things get weirder by the second with this administration.
Thank you Senator!  Keep standing up for a free press!
Thank you @SenBennetCO - Very proud that you are my Senator from Colorado!
You give me hope when I'm terrified of the future under this administration and congress.
As opposed to a press free zone, ha!
If you honor this you have my vote until you choose to retire. Absolutely necessary for the continued security of our republic.
Thank you for standing up for America and Americans.  Proud to be from colorado and proud of you.

Serious idea: Democratic Senators should escort members of the Press everywhere to facilitate coverage until this rule is rescinded.
Colorado represent!
Thank you Senator!!
Better idea. Time to start arresting members of Congress as enemies of the state.
As an American concerned about my 1st Amendment rights being violated by Senate censorship of journalists, thank you!
Thank you, Senator! From Paonia, CO
Thank you Senator. As a constituent I'm proud of your support of free press.
That's MY SENATOR.  Many thanks, Michael !
Thank you!! Please keep fighting for our rights!!! We can't let this president take us down this dangerous path!
Please, Senator. Shut down the Senate floor and don't agree to unanimous consent on anything.  This health care legislation is inhumane!
TY, Senator,  from a constituent  (81621).
Good on ya.
make them stand outside in the 90+ heat since they love #climatechange so much!  Cut the air conditioned safe-space!  @SenateGOP
@SenateDems yassss!!!! 
This brought tears of pride and patriotism to my eyes. Thank you, @SenBennetCO!
Senator - Dems should be in the halls engaging reporters on camera with this message. Fight back. We are begging you.
Thank you Senator.
Love you @SenBennetCO keep free press alive! Tell the hypocritical senate leadership where they can shove it! #allfreepressequal
This infuriates me! This is the people's business. It directly affects our lives & health. We R paying them 2 do right by us as our reps.
Thank you Senator Bennet! #FreethePress
Thank you for not letting GOP halt democrisy.
"Not allow" is that proper English ?
Bravo.
Nice job Senator.  They work For Us!
It's our building and our employees.
Thanks! Other @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats should follow suit.
Now they're all hiding!
Thank you Senator! I'm a constituent and I appreciate you representing Colorado with class and grace
@kasie Thank you for being an adult, a professional, & for protecting our right to know what our public servants vs are doing!
Thank you for continuing to listen to your constituents and doing the right thing. If only we could get @SenCoryGardner to do the same.
Totally agree.  @SenCoryGardner just had dinner with trump and rubio at the white house before Coney testimony.  He needs to go. Disgusting!
Thank you @SenBennetCO.  @SenateDems, organize!  This is appalling!
You go, Senator! Thank you for standing up to this INSANITY & dictatorial 45*. This must stop!!
#Russiagate
#Russiagate
#TrumpDictator
Thank u sen Bennett. Nice to have someone from co who puts country first. Sen Gardner does not
Thanks sir, every other @SenateDems should do the same @timkaine @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBookerOffice @alfranken
Thank you @SenBennetCO !!! @ReutersUS @jeffmason1
Doorway stakeouts.
Thank you, Senator. Speaking of free press: 1/2
2/2 is selling targeted advertising to Foreign Agents in order to sway an election a high crime or a misdemeanor? Or merely unpatriotic
Thank you, Senator!

It's come down to this - free press/1st amendment zones in the capitol.
Thank you. @realDonaldTrump is taking our country down a slippery slope. W/out TRUE Americans like you, we could become another Russia
It's time to withhold consent Senator. Nothing moves without YOUR consent. Do something besides talk.
Thank you! @kasie will spread the word! Calls should be directed to @SenShelby #SenateRulesCommittee #FreedomOfThePress
This is awesome. Except the government is a free press zone. So its a little sad too.
Thank you. Keep working for us Senator.
Thank you for protecting the FREE PRESS that is so critical to our democracy.
